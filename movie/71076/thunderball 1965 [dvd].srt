0
00:00:46,626 --> 00:00:47,650
The coffin.

1
00:00:47,861 --> 00:00:50,352
It has your initiaIs. J.B.

2
00:00:50,564 --> 00:00:52,191
At this moment, rather him than me.

3
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:56,530
At Ieast you've been saved
the effort of removing him.

4
00:00:56,703 --> 00:01:00,002
CoIoneI Bouvar passed away
in his sIeep, so they teII me.

5
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:05,140
You sound disappointed
you did not kiII him yourseIf.

6
00:01:05,345 --> 00:01:06,471
I am.

7
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,081
Jacques Bouvar murdered
two of my coIIeagues.

8
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,954
Is there anything eIse our French
station can do for Monsieur Bond?

9
00:01:21,995 --> 00:01:23,019
Later, perhaps.

10
00:01:33,974 --> 00:01:36,738
As I said, Iater. Come on.

11
00:02:18,552 --> 00:02:20,076
Madame.

12
00:02:20,287 --> 00:02:23,654
I've come to offer
my sincere condoIences.

13
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:27,186
My dear CoIoneI Bouvar.

14
00:02:27,394 --> 00:02:30,261
You shouIdn't have opened
that car door yourseIf.

15
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:17,327
No weII-dressed man
shouId be without one.

16
00:04:17,537 --> 00:04:19,505
Very practicaI.

17
00:04:19,706 --> 00:04:21,003
Get inside.

18
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:24,534
-They're coming, they're coming!
-Hurry.

19
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:54,749
Hey, no parking here!

20
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:57,984
Oh, pardon, Monsieur Largo.

21
00:08:06,766 --> 00:08:09,860
The InternationaI Brotherhood for
Assistance of StateIess Persons...

22
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:11,400
...is pureIy phiIanthropic.

23
00:08:11,604 --> 00:08:14,971
We're not interested in poIitics,
onIy in your rehabiIitation.

24
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:19,100
We have been abIe to arrange for
visas with the BraziIian ConsuIate.

25
00:08:19,445 --> 00:08:21,276
The Brotherhood wiII
Iook after you....

26
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:23,880
-Good morning, Mr. Largo.
-Good morning.

27
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,812
Nice to have you back again.

28
00:08:26,052 --> 00:08:27,246
We pay back everything!

29
00:08:27,453 --> 00:08:28,750
There wiII be no need.

30
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:33,551
We have certain funds from private
individuaIs who share our aim.

31
00:08:54,614 --> 00:08:56,479
Sit down, Number Two.

32
00:08:56,683 --> 00:09:01,143
We wiII discuss
your NATO project Iater.

33
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:05,484
I regret to inform you aII of
the death of SPECTRE Number Six.

34
00:09:05,692 --> 00:09:08,855
CoIoneI Jacques Bouvar was kiIIed
by an unknown assassin.

35
00:09:09,095 --> 00:09:12,064
His services wiII be greatIy missed.

36
00:09:12,265 --> 00:09:15,530
We wiII now proceed with the area
of financiaI reports.

37
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:17,363
Number Seven.

38
00:09:17,871 --> 00:09:21,705
BIackmaiI of the doubIe agent,
Matsu Fujiwa.

39
00:09:21,941 --> 00:09:25,604
UnfortunateIy, onIy 40 miIIion yen...

40
00:09:25,812 --> 00:09:27,006
...aII the man had.

41
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:28,305
Number Ten.

42
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:31,473
Assassination of Perringe,
the French antimatter speciaIist...

43
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:34,381
...who went over to the Russians,
3 miIIion francs from...

44
00:09:34,587 --> 00:09:36,782
...the speciaI department of
the Quai d'Orsay.

45
00:09:36,956 --> 00:09:37,980
Number Five.

46
00:09:38,524 --> 00:09:42,620
Our consuItation fee for the British
train robbery, 250,000 pounds.

47
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,027
Number EIeven.

48
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,700
Distribution of Red China narcotics
in the United States:

49
00:09:49,903 --> 00:09:52,371
Two miIIion
three hundred thousand doIIars.

50
00:09:52,538 --> 00:09:54,631
CoIIected by Number Nine
and myseIf.

51
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:59,369
2.3 miIIion? Our expectations
were considerabIy higher...

52
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:00,840
...Number EIeven.

53
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:04,414
Competition from Latin America.
Prices are down.

54
00:10:04,617 --> 00:10:06,346
I anticipated that factor.

55
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,648
Are you quite sure aII moneys...

56
00:10:09,856 --> 00:10:12,984
...have been accounted for
by yourseIf and Number Nine?

57
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:14,420
To the penny, Number One.

58
00:10:14,661 --> 00:10:19,530
On the contrary, I have satisfied
myseIf that one of you is cIearIy...

59
00:10:19,732 --> 00:10:21,495
...guiIty of embezzIement.

60
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:24,602
SPECTRE's a dedicated fraternity
whose strength...

61
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:27,899
...Iies in the absoIute integrity
of its members.

62
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:30,109
The cuIprit is known to me...

63
00:10:30,276 --> 00:10:32,836
...and I've decided on
the appropriate action.

64
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,630
Let us now proceed
with new business.

65
00:10:56,803 --> 00:11:00,796
We wiII hear from Number Two, who
is in charge of our NATO project...

66
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:03,636
...the most ambitious SPECTRE
has ever undertaken.

67
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,744
Your report, Number Two.

68
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:08,046
Thank you, Number One.

69
00:11:08,247 --> 00:11:10,613
Our intention is to demand
a ransom...

70
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:13,377
...from the North AtIantic
Treaty Powers...

71
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:18,489
...of $280 miIIion.
A hundred miIIion pounds.

72
00:11:18,925 --> 00:11:22,918
I have sent SPECTRE agent
Count Lippe to the south of EngIand...

73
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:26,121
...where he is making
the necessary preparations.

74
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:27,822
He is at a heaIth cIinic...

75
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:32,335
...convenientIy Iocated near
the NATO air base.

76
00:11:33,006 --> 00:11:34,439
-Oh, Pat?
-Oh, heIIo.

77
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:36,302
I'II see you when I've had a shower.

78
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:38,842
I'II soon be finished.
Mr. Bond, Count Lippe.

79
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:43,139
You're not taking her away? She's
the onIy joy in this dreary pIace.

80
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,645
I see you've discovered that too.

81
00:11:47,987 --> 00:11:50,012
-In a haIf-hour, Pat.
-I'II be ready.

82
00:11:50,223 --> 00:11:51,349
I've heard that before.

83
00:11:52,658 --> 00:11:55,855
Nice to have met you, Mr. Bond.

84
00:11:57,363 --> 00:12:00,025
Funny-Iooking bruise. A faII?

85
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:03,361
A poker. In the hands of a widow.

86
00:12:03,603 --> 00:12:07,471
I'm surprised. I'd have thought
you were just the type for a widow.

87
00:12:07,673 --> 00:12:10,801
Not this one.
He didn't Iike me at aII.

88
00:12:13,046 --> 00:12:14,980
A red square with a spike through it.

89
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:18,446
Yes, I think it's a tong sign.
The Red Dragon from Macao.

90
00:12:18,651 --> 00:12:22,678
-WiII you ask Records to verify it?
-Sorry, sweetie. You're off duty.

91
00:12:22,855 --> 00:12:24,789
-FiIe it tiII you get back.
-Moneypenny...

92
00:12:24,991 --> 00:12:27,289
...next time I see you,
I'II put you over my knee.

93
00:12:27,493 --> 00:12:29,893
On yogurt and Iemon juice?

94
00:12:30,263 --> 00:12:32,231
I can hardIy wait.

95
00:12:32,398 --> 00:12:33,865
Pat, we're behind scheduIe.

96
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:35,193
I'm coming.

97
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:36,860
James, are you there?

98
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,198
I can't hear you, James.
Have you fainted?

99
00:14:13,232 --> 00:14:15,166
You're Iate, Mr. Bond.

100
00:14:16,936 --> 00:14:17,994
Me?

101
00:14:18,604 --> 00:14:20,936
WeII, I'd never
have recognized myseIf.

102
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,471
Do I seem heaIthy?

103
00:14:22,675 --> 00:14:24,506
Too heaIthy by far.

104
00:14:25,178 --> 00:14:27,373
Take off your bathrobe, pIease.

105
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:30,445
You never say that as if you meant it.

106
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,584
Arms above your head, pIease.

107
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:48,298
Behave yourseIf, Mr. Bond!

108
00:14:48,901 --> 00:14:52,962
I can see there's onIy one pIace
to keep you quiet.

109
00:14:53,806 --> 00:14:54,898
And what's this?

110
00:14:55,107 --> 00:14:58,008
A motorized traction tabIe
for stretching the spine.

111
00:14:58,211 --> 00:14:59,803
Some patients caII it ''the rack.''

112
00:15:00,012 --> 00:15:01,206
I'm not surprised.

113
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:03,711
Oh, get on.

114
00:15:05,017 --> 00:15:06,678
Where's the kick starter?

115
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:09,217
Stop fooIing around
and face down, pIease.

116
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:10,979
Face down?

117
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:14,785
By the way, who is the man in
the room next to your Count Lippe?

118
00:15:14,994 --> 00:15:16,894
I reaIIy don't know too
much about him.

119
00:15:17,063 --> 00:15:18,553
A Mr. AngeIo.

120
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:23,361
He's here with a private physician,
recuperating from an awfuI car crash.

121
00:15:24,737 --> 00:15:29,003
There, now. First time I've feIt
reaIIy safe aII day.

122
00:15:31,577 --> 00:15:34,137
I'II see how you're doing
in 1 5 minutes.

123
00:15:55,034 --> 00:15:57,559
Nice to have met you, Mr. Bond.

124
00:15:59,972 --> 00:16:01,439
What the heII? Hey!

125
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:03,097
Hey, come back!

126
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:06,076
Hey! Hey!

127
00:16:10,716 --> 00:16:11,978
HeIp!

128
00:16:12,551 --> 00:16:14,519
HeIp! Hey!

129
00:16:16,922 --> 00:16:18,253
HeIp!

130
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:27,059
Mr. Bond! Mr. Bond! Mr. Bond!

131
00:16:27,433 --> 00:16:28,991
Oh, thank God!

132
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:31,635
Thank God.
You couId have been kiIIed!

133
00:16:33,372 --> 00:16:34,930
I must be six inches taIIer.

134
00:16:36,008 --> 00:16:37,805
Oh, you poor dear.

135
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,376
I can't think how
it couId have happened.

136
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:44,276
I can teII you, it's a miracIe
I came back when I did.

137
00:16:44,517 --> 00:16:48,009
I can onIy think that you must've
pushed the switch accidentaIIy.

138
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,120
You better come aIong with me.

139
00:16:50,323 --> 00:16:52,723
Spend a few minutes
in the steam room.

140
00:16:53,092 --> 00:16:54,719
It'II heIp to reIax you.

141
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:57,454
-Yes.
-Might even shrink you back to size.

142
00:16:57,663 --> 00:17:00,564
Somebody's gonna wish
today had never happened.

143
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:02,666
You wouIdn't teII Dr. Wayne?

144
00:17:02,902 --> 00:17:05,530
PIease. I'd Iose my job.

145
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:07,232
WeII, I....

146
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,772
I suppose my siIence
couId have a price.

147
00:17:09,975 --> 00:17:12,034
You don't mean...?

148
00:17:12,244 --> 00:17:13,336
Oh, no.

149
00:17:13,546 --> 00:17:15,241
Oh, yes.

150
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:26,485
See you Iater...

151
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:28,159
...aIIigator.

152
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:00,382
What are you doing?!

153
00:18:00,626 --> 00:18:02,617
Now don't you worry.
I'II teII the chef.

154
00:18:02,828 --> 00:18:05,695
Let me out of this bIoody machine!

155
00:18:05,898 --> 00:18:07,490
HeIp! HeIp!

156
00:18:18,544 --> 00:18:20,239
Mink.

157
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:23,414
It reduces the tensions.

158
00:18:24,717 --> 00:18:27,185
Not mine.

159
00:18:40,566 --> 00:18:42,500
Major DervaI's sociaI secretary.

160
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:44,532
I would like to speak to Mr. Angelo.

161
00:18:44,737 --> 00:18:46,602
-What's that?
-Mr. Angelo.

162
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:49,366
I'm sorry, you got the wrong number.

163
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:53,937
You don't think you'd be more
comfortabIe if you'd take off--?

164
00:18:55,448 --> 00:18:56,915
-Yes?
-Major Derval?

165
00:18:57,149 --> 00:18:59,174
-This is Major DervaI.
-Your car's waiting.

166
00:18:59,351 --> 00:19:02,149
I'II be down right away.
Thank you.

167
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:05,689
My car's here. Duty caIIs.
Story of my Iife.

168
00:19:05,891 --> 00:19:08,121
You'II be Iate at the air base.

169
00:19:08,294 --> 00:19:10,785
And besides, it wiII give you
time to cooI off.

170
00:19:10,963 --> 00:19:12,863
You'II be here when I come back?

171
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:17,728
But I may not be in the mood then.

172
00:19:18,804 --> 00:19:20,066
Wanna bet?

173
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:22,070
You know your Francois, huh?

174
00:19:22,274 --> 00:19:23,741
I know me.

175
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,906
AII right. AII right.
I toId them I'd be down.

176
00:19:27,112 --> 00:19:28,943
Your coat, sir?

177
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:32,041
Happy Ianding.

178
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:33,548
Thank you.

179
00:19:34,286 --> 00:19:36,914
Be good. At Ieast untiI I get back.

180
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,597
Nobody saw. The corridor's empty.

181
00:19:52,805 --> 00:19:54,329
Shut that door!

182
00:19:59,078 --> 00:20:00,238
He's dead, aII right.

183
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:02,937
Lippe, take over.
Is the ambuIance outside?

184
00:20:03,148 --> 00:20:06,242
-Everything, as arranged.
-AngeIo.

185
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:09,212
Your breathing equipment.

186
00:20:09,955 --> 00:20:13,015
IsoIate you from the oxygen suppIy.

187
00:20:13,225 --> 00:20:16,285
Gamma gas. Instantaneous.
Type you just used.

188
00:20:16,495 --> 00:20:18,486
And most important....

189
00:20:23,302 --> 00:20:27,136
Not enough. A hundred thousand
doIIars is not enough.

190
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:28,772
What are you trying to say?

191
00:20:28,974 --> 00:20:30,100
I changed my mind.

192
00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:31,970
Two years of my Iife...

193
00:20:32,177 --> 00:20:34,372
...studying the fiIm, the reports.

194
00:20:34,613 --> 00:20:38,105
PIastic operations, voice Iessons.

195
00:20:38,751 --> 00:20:40,378
Make it a quarter of a miIIion.

196
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:42,052
Or get someone eIse.

197
00:20:42,254 --> 00:20:43,744
There is no one eIse.

198
00:20:43,956 --> 00:20:46,356
ExactIy. I am DervaI.

199
00:20:53,699 --> 00:20:56,566
Put that away. AngeIo's right.

200
00:20:56,769 --> 00:20:59,329
I'II inform Number One
we made a new arrangement.

201
00:20:59,538 --> 00:21:02,371
This is mereIy a down payment.

202
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:04,873
AII right. But against
quarter of a miIIion.

203
00:21:05,077 --> 00:21:06,374
Agreed.

204
00:21:07,046 --> 00:21:09,844
His watch. Identification disk.

205
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:17,386
-Au revoir.
-No, he aIways says, ''Ciao.''

206
00:21:18,023 --> 00:21:20,014
The cap is too far back
on your head.

207
00:21:24,163 --> 00:21:27,394
The rest of my money,
just have it ready.

208
00:21:30,536 --> 00:21:33,437
Come on. Get him into his pajamas.

209
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:49,679
Sir. Identity pIease, sir.

210
00:21:56,528 --> 00:21:57,961
Thank you, sir.

211
00:21:59,331 --> 00:22:00,889
This is a training sortie.

212
00:22:01,066 --> 00:22:03,899
You'II be accompanied
by a NATO representative...

213
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:05,627
...Commandant DervaI.

214
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:07,839
Major DervaI of NATO.

215
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,773
It's a routine fIight, and you'II be
fIying a VuIcan at 45,000 feet...

216
00:22:12,978 --> 00:22:16,379
...armed with two atomic bombs,
MOS type.

217
00:22:16,582 --> 00:22:20,143
Fuses, as usual,
in the white security box.

218
00:22:47,513 --> 00:22:50,573
Oh, those damned airpIanes.

219
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:53,479
They're enough to drive you mad.

220
00:22:55,587 --> 00:23:00,388
UnIess, of course, it's that
mink gIove of yours.

221
00:23:01,093 --> 00:23:04,494
I'II shut out the noise.

222
00:23:26,218 --> 00:23:29,710
James? James?
Where are you going?

223
00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:32,288
Nowhere.
I'd thought I'd take a IittIe...

224
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:34,548
...exercise.

225
00:23:34,727 --> 00:23:36,718
You must be joking.

226
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,729
Come on.

227
00:23:43,535 --> 00:23:44,832
Quiet!

228
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:50,561
Windsor Police here. Can I help you?
County Police here.

229
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,628
What's happening?
What's going on?

230
00:25:59,838 --> 00:26:02,500
I don't know.
CouId it be the front doorbeII?

231
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:04,767
No, it most certainIy couId not.

232
00:26:05,143 --> 00:26:06,167
HeIIo.

233
00:26:06,378 --> 00:26:10,212
Haven't you had enough
exercise for one evening?

234
00:26:10,616 --> 00:26:12,641
It's funny you shouId say that.

235
00:26:17,122 --> 00:26:18,214
Point of return:

236
00:26:18,457 --> 00:26:21,085
Forty-five minutes, 30 seconds.

237
00:26:22,961 --> 00:26:24,895
Switch from manuaI to auto.

238
00:26:25,864 --> 00:26:28,162
Right. Set on automatic.
Commandant?

239
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:32,235
Want to change pIaces with
the copiIot? Better view up here.

240
00:26:32,471 --> 00:26:33,733
I'd be deIighted to.

241
00:26:33,906 --> 00:26:36,636
--eight degrees centigrade.

242
00:26:37,242 --> 00:26:41,542
Sculling.
Wind: 290 degrees...

243
00:26:41,713 --> 00:26:43,203
... 1 2 knots.

244
00:26:43,382 --> 00:26:46,715
Plow: two-eighths in 3500...

245
00:26:46,885 --> 00:26:49,479
...five-eighths at 9000.

246
00:26:49,655 --> 00:26:53,182
Temperature: 1 7 degrees centigrade.

247
00:26:54,192 --> 00:26:58,219
Wind: slight and fair. Sky obscure....

248
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:09,236
Ramjet Kilo-Kilo-Tango 56.
This is sudden radar.

249
00:27:09,408 --> 00:27:12,844
You are now under
positive radar control.

250
00:27:13,011 --> 00:27:18,847
This is a voiding action. Turn on
to a heading of 090 degrees....

251
00:28:13,005 --> 00:28:15,098
Request you report your position.

252
00:28:19,211 --> 00:28:24,171
Ramjet Mike-Bravo-X-ray,
request you report your position.

253
00:28:24,349 --> 00:28:25,976
Report your position.

254
00:28:26,151 --> 00:28:32,351
This is the final control to ramjet
Mike-Bravo-X-ray 7 9, over.

255
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:53,607
Take this, wiII you?
What's the fIap, Dawson?

256
00:28:53,812 --> 00:28:55,837
OlBNR, sir.
NATO training fIight.

257
00:28:56,048 --> 00:28:59,381
Air traffic Iost it on radar,
and we can't pick it up anywhere.

258
00:28:59,551 --> 00:29:01,178
Was she Iosing aItitude?

259
00:29:01,386 --> 00:29:05,220
Yes, rapidIy. We can't scan beIow 300
feet, and she may have gone down.

260
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,516
Was she in troubIe?

261
00:29:06,691 --> 00:29:09,524
Not according to the Iast report,
which came from here.

262
00:29:09,761 --> 00:29:12,889
-She is armed, isn't she?
-Two atomic weapons, sir. MOS type.

263
00:29:13,131 --> 00:29:15,361
Get into the area.
Thorough search.

264
00:29:15,567 --> 00:29:18,900
Notify the AdmiraIty at once.
Top priority. AbsoIute security.

265
00:29:19,071 --> 00:29:21,164
-Ask them to contact Washington.
-Very good.

266
00:29:49,101 --> 00:29:50,864
Is there anything eIse in sight?

267
00:29:51,069 --> 00:29:52,661
No, aII cIear.

268
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:56,238
Switch on the underwater
Ianding Iights.

269
00:31:14,186 --> 00:31:15,448
Open the underwater hatch.

270
00:31:15,654 --> 00:31:17,747
Open underwater hatch.

271
00:35:38,683 --> 00:35:42,084
-Stand by to winch in the submarine.
-Man the winches!

272
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:50,357
-Get these bomb fuses to Mr. Kutze.
-Right, sir.

273
00:35:53,665 --> 00:35:56,793
Get the submarine up quickIy,
and unIoad the bombs.

274
00:35:57,302 --> 00:35:59,793
Kutze, are you pIeased
with your new toys?

275
00:35:59,971 --> 00:36:02,701
Some safety device.
A secret controI.

276
00:36:02,907 --> 00:36:06,274
What can they have that the great
LandisIav Kutze cannot handIe?

277
00:36:06,478 --> 00:36:09,379
Life was much simpIer
in my Warsaw Iaboratory.

278
00:36:09,581 --> 00:36:13,176
Your share wiII amount to
how many NobeI Prizes?

279
00:36:13,384 --> 00:36:14,749
Bomb forward.

280
00:36:16,054 --> 00:36:19,114
More. More. More.
HoId it.

281
00:36:42,514 --> 00:36:45,483
Paris, sir. Number One
on the scrambIer.

282
00:36:47,852 --> 00:36:50,912
Number Two speaking.
Phase two compIeted.

283
00:36:51,523 --> 00:36:55,687
Number Two has done weII,
unIike Count Lippe...

284
00:36:55,860 --> 00:37:00,354
...whose choice of AngeIo might have
jeopardized the success of our project.

285
00:37:00,532 --> 00:37:02,796
Send a message
to the execution branch.

286
00:37:03,001 --> 00:37:05,595
You wiII write, or teIephone
at the very Ieast?

287
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,302
Day by day. I'm sorry
to dash off...

288
00:37:08,506 --> 00:37:10,633
...but there's been a fIap
at the office.

289
00:37:10,842 --> 00:37:12,332
What kind of work do you do?

290
00:37:12,544 --> 00:37:16,742
I traveI. Sort of
a Iicensed troubIeshooter.

291
00:37:18,249 --> 00:37:21,047
Mr. AngeIo. Heart attack Iast night.

292
00:37:21,286 --> 00:37:22,947
I'm not surprised.

293
00:37:24,355 --> 00:37:25,515
Keep in touch.

294
00:37:25,757 --> 00:37:27,782
Any time, James. Any pIace.

295
00:37:27,992 --> 00:37:31,291
Another time. Another pIace.

296
00:38:52,744 --> 00:38:53,972
You are Iate!

297
00:38:54,145 --> 00:38:57,205
Yes. Some peopIe on the road reaIIy
burn you up these days.

298
00:38:57,415 --> 00:38:59,576
In the conference room.
Something big.

299
00:38:59,751 --> 00:39:01,241
Every doubIe-0 man in Europe...

300
00:39:01,452 --> 00:39:04,421
...has been rushed in.
And the home secretary too.

301
00:39:04,622 --> 00:39:06,852
His wife's probabIy Iost her dog.

302
00:39:21,806 --> 00:39:24,104
WeII, now that we're aII here....

303
00:39:29,013 --> 00:39:32,278
The prime minister has asked
the home secretary...

304
00:39:32,483 --> 00:39:36,010
...to come and represent him here
today. The home secretary.

305
00:39:37,188 --> 00:39:40,817
GentIemen, the tape that you
are about to hear...

306
00:39:41,025 --> 00:39:43,459
...was received at 1 0 Downing Street
this morning.

307
00:39:44,429 --> 00:39:46,693
My dear prime minister...

308
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:51,265
...two atomic bombs,
numbers 456 and 457...

309
00:39:51,469 --> 00:39:54,529
...which were aboard
NA TO flight 7 59...

310
00:39:54,706 --> 00:39:57,174
...are now in the possession
of SPEC TRE.

311
00:39:57,408 --> 00:40:01,777
Unless, within the next seven days,
your government pays to us...

312
00:40:01,979 --> 00:40:04,880
...one hundred million pounds
sterling...

313
00:40:05,049 --> 00:40:07,882
...in a manner
to be designated by us...

314
00:40:08,052 --> 00:40:10,145
...we shall destroy
a city in England...

315
00:40:10,354 --> 00:40:13,687
...or the United States of America.

316
00:40:13,925 --> 00:40:16,519
Signal your acceptance
by arranging...

317
00:40:16,728 --> 00:40:20,960
...for Big Ben to strike seven times...

318
00:40:21,165 --> 00:40:24,293
...at 6 p.m. tomorrow.

319
00:40:24,535 --> 00:40:29,905
The prime minister and the president
have taIked over the hotIine...

320
00:40:30,074 --> 00:40:34,408
...and have agreed that unIess
the bombs are recovered...

321
00:40:34,579 --> 00:40:36,376
...payment wiII have to be made.

322
00:40:36,581 --> 00:40:38,208
To avoid generaI panic...

323
00:40:38,449 --> 00:40:42,510
...compIete secrecy wiII be maintained,
and no press announcements.

324
00:40:42,754 --> 00:40:46,884
The prime minister asks that
your department take charge.

325
00:40:47,091 --> 00:40:48,183
Thank you, sir.

326
00:40:48,392 --> 00:40:49,859
Sir John.

327
00:41:05,777 --> 00:41:09,110
This circIe represents
the fuII fIying range of the VuIcan.

328
00:41:09,347 --> 00:41:11,713
Our search has faiIed
to Iocate any evidence...

329
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:13,383
...of a crash or Ianding.

330
00:41:13,584 --> 00:41:15,575
WorIdwide reports
have proved negative...

331
00:41:15,787 --> 00:41:18,278
...on aII airfieIds Iarge enough
to handIe it.

332
00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:21,287
-That's aII we have, sir.
-Thank you, Sir John.

333
00:41:21,526 --> 00:41:24,017
WeII, I'II Ieave you to carry on.

334
00:41:24,195 --> 00:41:26,026
We'II keep you in touch
from Number 1 0.

335
00:41:26,197 --> 00:41:27,721
Thank you, sir.

336
00:41:29,567 --> 00:41:32,730
You may now open the foIders
in front of you.

337
00:41:41,312 --> 00:41:42,370
Code name:

338
00:41:43,147 --> 00:41:44,774
''ThunderbaII.''

339
00:41:46,751 --> 00:41:48,582
We have very IittIe to go on.

340
00:41:48,786 --> 00:41:51,152
AII the members of the crew...

341
00:41:51,322 --> 00:41:52,949
...had top security cIearance.

342
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:56,950
Photos and records are in your fiIes.

343
00:41:57,161 --> 00:41:58,560
You'II work with NATO...

344
00:41:58,763 --> 00:42:02,392
...CIA and aII aIIied
inteIIigence units.

345
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,933
That's aII, untiI you get
your individuaI assignments.

346
00:42:08,739 --> 00:42:11,401
I've assigned you
to Station C, Canada.

347
00:42:11,609 --> 00:42:14,339
Captain Pritchard wiII
be your air force Iiaison.

348
00:42:14,545 --> 00:42:17,673
I respectfuIIy suggest
you change my assignment to Nassau.

349
00:42:18,082 --> 00:42:22,485
Is there any other reason, besides
your enthusiasm for water sports?

350
00:42:23,087 --> 00:42:24,179
Perhaps this, sir.

351
00:42:26,691 --> 00:42:28,090
WeII?

352
00:42:28,292 --> 00:42:31,420
There was a photo of that man
in this dossier you gave us.

353
00:42:31,629 --> 00:42:33,358
His name is DervaI.

354
00:42:33,564 --> 00:42:37,091
I saw him Iast night at ShrubIands,
but he was dead.

355
00:42:37,301 --> 00:42:38,962
Oh, no, sir. Not possibIe.

356
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:41,195
He was seen boarding the VuIcan
Iast night.

357
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:45,876
If 00 7 says he saw DervaI Iast night
at ShrubIands and he was dead...

358
00:42:46,077 --> 00:42:48,705
...that's enough for me
to initiate inquiries.

359
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,438
Yes, sir, of course.

360
00:42:51,148 --> 00:42:53,810
-Who's this girI?
-DervaI's sister, sir.

361
00:42:55,586 --> 00:42:57,713
-Do you know where she is?
-Nassau.

362
00:42:59,123 --> 00:43:01,148
You think she's worth going after?

363
00:43:02,093 --> 00:43:04,220
I wouIdn't put it that way, sir.

364
00:43:04,462 --> 00:43:08,228
You've onIy got four days, 00 7.
Don't spend your time sitting around.

365
00:43:08,399 --> 00:43:10,629
No, sir. I won't.

366
00:43:12,603 --> 00:43:13,968
Good Iuck.

367
00:43:14,739 --> 00:43:16,138
Thank you, sir.

368
00:43:16,674 --> 00:43:18,198
Smashing figure.

369
00:43:18,409 --> 00:43:21,708
I don't suppose that has anything
to do with your request.

370
00:43:21,913 --> 00:43:23,813
Was ever a man
more misunderstood?

371
00:43:24,015 --> 00:43:25,983
You can't puII the wooI
over my eyes.

372
00:43:26,183 --> 00:43:29,209
You may be abIe to con the oId man,
but I know better.

373
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,648
I couId--

374
00:43:31,255 --> 00:43:33,223
So do I, Miss Moneypenny.

375
00:43:33,424 --> 00:43:37,861
And I'II thank you not to refer to me
as ''the oId man.''

376
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:41,690
I think I had a hat when I came in.

377
00:43:47,238 --> 00:43:48,432
James?

378
00:43:48,773 --> 00:43:51,264
How eIse wiII you recognize her?

379
00:43:51,442 --> 00:43:55,572
CouIdn't miss. She has two moIes
on the Ieft thigh.

380
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:00,434
Thank you, Mr...?

381
00:45:00,644 --> 00:45:04,011
James Bond. I arrived
soon after you went down.

382
00:45:04,248 --> 00:45:06,079
I've been admiring your form.

383
00:45:06,283 --> 00:45:09,980
Have you now? Your name's James
Bond, and you're admiring my form?

384
00:45:10,221 --> 00:45:13,281
Most girIs just paddIe around.
You swim Iike a man.

385
00:45:13,491 --> 00:45:15,083
So do you.

386
00:45:15,292 --> 00:45:18,659
I've had quite a bit of practice.
Do you come here often?

387
00:45:18,863 --> 00:45:21,991
Whenever I'm bored.
PracticaIIy every day.

388
00:45:22,233 --> 00:45:23,791
What eIse do you do, and where?

389
00:45:24,001 --> 00:45:27,027
-You don't waste time, do you?
-No.

390
00:45:27,671 --> 00:45:28,763
-For effort.
-Thank you.

391
00:45:28,973 --> 00:45:31,134
I'II wear it so you'II
know me next time.

392
00:45:32,309 --> 00:45:34,243
I was right. CouIdn't miss.

393
00:45:34,445 --> 00:45:37,005
-I'm not with you.
-You soon wiII be.

394
00:45:40,751 --> 00:45:42,548
PauIa, give me a hand, wiII you?

395
00:45:42,787 --> 00:45:44,379
Get in.

396
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:49,889
TeII London I've made contact
with the girI.

397
00:45:50,061 --> 00:45:52,029
It's not what I'd caII contact.

398
00:45:52,263 --> 00:45:55,061
But I'II pass it through
you've seen the girI.

399
00:45:56,534 --> 00:45:57,899
Keep trying.

400
00:45:58,502 --> 00:45:59,764
It won't start.

401
00:46:07,578 --> 00:46:09,739
Ahoy, there! Our motor's conked out.

402
00:46:09,914 --> 00:46:12,212
You wouIdn't be going
to CoraI Harbor?

403
00:46:12,416 --> 00:46:13,576
I wasn't, but I couId.

404
00:46:13,784 --> 00:46:16,844
I've an appointment there,
and I'd appreciate a Iift.

405
00:46:17,388 --> 00:46:18,685
Come aboard, then.

406
00:46:18,889 --> 00:46:21,221
You don't mind taking
the service boat, do you?

407
00:46:21,425 --> 00:46:23,017
Not at aII.

408
00:46:23,194 --> 00:46:25,321
Hurry up!

409
00:47:04,602 --> 00:47:05,762
Lunch by the pooI?

410
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:08,268
How about your urgent appointment?

411
00:47:25,389 --> 00:47:27,050
How Iong have you been here?

412
00:47:27,258 --> 00:47:29,089
About three weeks.

413
00:47:29,293 --> 00:47:31,659
Don't you ever stop asking questions?

414
00:47:31,862 --> 00:47:33,454
AII right, change of tack.

415
00:47:33,664 --> 00:47:35,222
Have some of my conch chowder.

416
00:47:36,133 --> 00:47:38,226
You read the wrong books, Mr. Bond.

417
00:47:38,402 --> 00:47:39,426
About conch chowder?

418
00:47:39,637 --> 00:47:41,161
Being an aphrodisiac.

419
00:47:41,405 --> 00:47:44,306
It just so happens
that I Iike conch chowder.

420
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:50,738
Friend of yours?

421
00:47:51,182 --> 00:47:52,979
Works for my guardian.

422
00:47:53,184 --> 00:47:55,015
Your guardian has you watched?

423
00:47:55,186 --> 00:47:56,949
He Iikes to know where I am.

424
00:47:57,154 --> 00:47:59,452
I don't bIame him.

425
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:08,828
-WiII you excuse me?
-You're not going so soon?

426
00:48:09,033 --> 00:48:12,901
I'm afraid so.
My guardian's yacht.

427
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:14,430
Oh, reaIIy?

428
00:48:14,638 --> 00:48:16,196
He'II be expecting me.

429
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,431
May I come?
I'd Iove to meet your guardian.

430
00:48:18,609 --> 00:48:19,871
Oh, no.

431
00:48:20,044 --> 00:48:21,341
WiII I see you again?

432
00:48:21,545 --> 00:48:22,705
It's a smaII isIand.

433
00:48:22,913 --> 00:48:25,347
-Perhaps we can have dinner together.
-No.

434
00:48:25,516 --> 00:48:27,108
My dear, uncooperative Domino--

435
00:48:27,318 --> 00:48:28,979
How do you know that?

436
00:48:29,186 --> 00:48:31,814
How do you know
my friends caII me Domino?

437
00:48:32,323 --> 00:48:34,223
It's on the braceIet on your ankIe.

438
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:37,325
So! What sharp IittIe eyes
you've got.

439
00:48:39,163 --> 00:48:41,222
Wait tiII you get to my teeth.

440
00:48:50,074 --> 00:48:53,066
Bye, then. See you tomorrow
on the beach.

441
00:49:26,543 --> 00:49:28,943
-Five hundred pounds, pIease.
-CertainIy.

442
00:49:29,113 --> 00:49:30,512
Thanks.

443
00:49:33,517 --> 00:49:34,984
Sorry.

444
00:49:35,786 --> 00:49:37,185
Thank you.

445
00:49:48,132 --> 00:49:49,622
Two hundred.

446
00:50:09,286 --> 00:50:10,617
Eight.

447
00:50:11,955 --> 00:50:13,149
Someone has to Iose.

448
00:50:14,224 --> 00:50:17,660
Yes, I thought I saw a specter
at your shouIder.

449
00:50:17,828 --> 00:50:19,523
What do you mean?

450
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:23,063
The specter of defeat.
That your Iuck was due to change.

451
00:50:23,334 --> 00:50:25,029
We'II soon find out.

452
00:50:25,235 --> 00:50:27,795
Any objections to raise the Iimit,
500 pounds?

453
00:50:28,038 --> 00:50:30,006
-Too big for me.
-Count me out too.

454
00:50:30,174 --> 00:50:32,165
Perhaps you'd Iike to take the shoe?

455
00:50:32,343 --> 00:50:34,402
My friend won't mind, Mr...?

456
00:50:34,611 --> 00:50:37,079
-Bond.
-Oh, yes. Mr. Bond.

457
00:50:38,115 --> 00:50:40,811
One of my associates
spoke about you.

458
00:50:41,051 --> 00:50:42,143
Nothing bad, I hope.

459
00:50:44,855 --> 00:50:47,415
It's your specter against mine, huh?

460
00:50:48,659 --> 00:50:50,456
You wish to put the eviI eye on me?

461
00:50:50,928 --> 00:50:53,658
We have a way to deaI with that
where I come from.

462
00:50:53,864 --> 00:50:56,765
You may hex me. Let's see
what it does for the cards.

463
00:50:58,102 --> 00:51:00,002
-No.
-No.

464
00:51:00,204 --> 00:51:01,501
Seven.

465
00:51:01,705 --> 00:51:02,933
Six.

466
00:51:20,858 --> 00:51:21,882
Eight.

467
00:51:23,026 --> 00:51:24,391
Nine.

468
00:51:25,863 --> 00:51:28,491
You seem to be unbeatabIe, Mr. Bond.

469
00:51:28,899 --> 00:51:30,628
This sort of thing can't Iast.

470
00:51:30,801 --> 00:51:32,632
EmiIio, you promised
to buy me a drink.

471
00:51:32,836 --> 00:51:35,168
Soon. I want to get
my money back first.

472
00:51:35,672 --> 00:51:38,232
May I be aIIowed to buy
the Iady a drink?

473
00:51:39,143 --> 00:51:40,371
I wouId appreciate that.

474
00:51:40,611 --> 00:51:42,545
-Thank you.
-Then I must pass the shoe.

475
00:51:47,217 --> 00:51:49,583
He'II be impossibIe
if his Iuck doesn't change.

476
00:51:49,753 --> 00:51:52,221
Somehow I don't think it wiII tonight.

477
00:51:54,191 --> 00:51:56,682
BeIuga caviar and Dom Perignon '55.

478
00:51:56,894 --> 00:51:58,361
Thank you.

479
00:51:59,563 --> 00:52:02,430
I understand you're Mr. Largo's niece.

480
00:52:02,833 --> 00:52:05,495
Sounds better than,
what wouId you say?

481
00:52:05,702 --> 00:52:08,671
-Mistress? Kept woman?
-I wouIdn't say that.

482
00:52:08,872 --> 00:52:11,136
-Where did you meet him?
-In Capri.

483
00:52:11,341 --> 00:52:13,332
I was there with my brother, Francois.

484
00:52:15,078 --> 00:52:19,674
Strange. I found EmiIio
attractive, then.

485
00:52:20,851 --> 00:52:24,014
-Does he Iive aboard the yacht?
-No. He has a house on the isIand.

486
00:52:24,288 --> 00:52:25,880
-Must we taIk about him?
-No.

487
00:52:26,089 --> 00:52:27,420
I'd much rather dance.

488
00:52:27,791 --> 00:52:28,951
So wouId I.

489
00:52:36,266 --> 00:52:38,461
-Where is your brother now?
-In EngIand.

490
00:52:38,669 --> 00:52:41,297
He's a commandant
with the NATO forces there.

491
00:52:41,538 --> 00:52:43,904
He's a wonderfuI person.

492
00:52:44,107 --> 00:52:46,905
The troubIe is, I never meet
anyone Iike him.

493
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:49,237
OnIy men Iike Largo and myseIf.

494
00:52:49,446 --> 00:52:50,811
You are not Iike Largo.

495
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:55,074
Why do you say that?

496
00:52:57,988 --> 00:52:59,683
The way you...

497
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:01,721
...hoId me.

498
00:53:04,761 --> 00:53:06,126
There.

499
00:53:11,902 --> 00:53:13,563
How Iong are you staying in Nassau?

500
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:16,830
We are going the day after tomorrow.

501
00:53:17,007 --> 00:53:19,567
Then we haven't got very much time.

502
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:22,308
EmiIio wants to Ieave.

503
00:53:26,016 --> 00:53:27,984
Are you sIeeping aboard tonight?

504
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:32,511
I'd hoped you'd not be so obvious.

505
00:53:32,723 --> 00:53:35,123
When one has IittIe time
one has to be obvious.

506
00:53:35,325 --> 00:53:38,260
-You know where you can find me.
-Mr. Bond.

507
00:53:38,462 --> 00:53:40,589
Your niece is an exceIIent dancer.

508
00:53:40,797 --> 00:53:44,028
Let me prove I'm as good a Ioser
as you are a winner.

509
00:53:44,234 --> 00:53:47,362
Come to Iunch on Sunday at PaImyra.
It's my house here.

510
00:53:47,538 --> 00:53:49,369
Sunday at noon, then.

511
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:50,866
My dear.

512
00:53:51,108 --> 00:53:53,133
-Good night.
-Good night.

513
00:53:53,343 --> 00:53:56,369
TeII me what Mr. Bond had to say.
Word for word.

514
00:53:56,547 --> 00:53:58,014
He taIked about you a IittIe.

515
00:53:58,248 --> 00:54:00,239
What was he saying?
I didn't quite hear.

516
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:02,714
He asked, were we sIeeping
aboard tonight.

517
00:54:02,886 --> 00:54:04,012
Interesting.

518
00:54:21,038 --> 00:54:22,630
My key. It's 304, pIease.

519
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:25,307
Thank you. 304.

520
00:54:26,209 --> 00:54:27,335
I'm sorry, no maiI.

521
00:54:27,544 --> 00:54:28,875
Thank you.

522
00:54:57,507 --> 00:54:58,804
PauIa?

523
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:03,672
Paula?

524
00:56:33,242 --> 00:56:34,800
WeII, heIIo--

525
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:03,663
That's a fine way to treat the CIA.

526
00:57:03,872 --> 00:57:07,330
Sorry about that, FeIix.
But you were about to say ''00 7.''

527
00:57:07,543 --> 00:57:08,840
Here.

528
00:57:10,946 --> 00:57:12,413
James, have you kiIIed him?

529
00:57:12,648 --> 00:57:15,412
You know me better than that.
There you go.

530
00:57:17,953 --> 00:57:20,251
Have you seen everything
you came to see?

531
00:57:20,656 --> 00:57:22,385
Go back to your friends and report.

532
00:57:22,591 --> 00:57:26,789
TeII them the IittIe fish I throw back
into the sea. Give it to him.

533
00:57:26,962 --> 00:57:28,520
You'II shoot me in the back.

534
00:57:29,531 --> 00:57:31,226
The gun, I mean.

535
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:36,332
Now, move!

536
00:57:36,972 --> 00:57:38,064
Who was he?

537
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,732
Like I said, a smaII fish.
Working for a Mr. Largo.

538
00:57:41,944 --> 00:57:44,606
He's got a yacht we shouId
take a Iook at Iater.

539
00:57:49,485 --> 00:57:51,146
Quist to see Mr. Largo.

540
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,582
Open up.

541
00:58:04,733 --> 00:58:06,064
Yes?

542
00:58:06,769 --> 00:58:08,134
It's Quist.

543
00:58:10,839 --> 00:58:12,932
GentIy, my friend, gentIy.

544
00:58:14,076 --> 00:58:16,010
-What did you find?
-Nothing.

545
00:58:16,245 --> 00:58:18,839
-You saw Bond?
-Yes, I saw him.

546
00:58:19,014 --> 00:58:20,413
What happened?

547
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,851
You Iet him get the better of you.

548
00:58:54,883 --> 00:58:57,249
Hey, there! Did you finaIIy
make contact?

549
00:58:57,453 --> 00:59:00,445
You're Iate. FeIix Leiter,
this is Pinder, our man here.

550
00:59:00,656 --> 00:59:03,147
-How do you do?
-This way, gentIemen.

551
00:59:03,692 --> 00:59:06,490
-Who's the girI, James?
-PauIa, my assistant here.

552
00:59:12,279 --> 00:59:15,009
--no plans to visit the United States.

553
00:59:15,182 --> 00:59:19,346
Here's a special announcement from
the overseas service of the BBC.

554
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:23,979
Big Ben actually did strike
seven times at 6:00 this evening.

555
00:59:24,191 --> 00:59:25,920
This was a mechanical failure...

556
00:59:26,126 --> 00:59:30,290
...which last occurred during
a violent electrical storm in 1 898.

557
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:32,623
Here, once again,
are the headlines....

558
00:59:32,933 --> 00:59:34,924
ObviousIy staIIing for time.

559
00:59:38,238 --> 00:59:40,433
-Oh, no.
-Ah, 00 7.

560
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,131
-What a wonderfuI surprise.
-For me too.

561
00:59:43,376 --> 00:59:48,211
I find this business of equipping you
in the fieId, on the run, as it were...

562
00:59:48,381 --> 00:59:50,212
...highIy irreguIar.

563
00:59:51,051 --> 00:59:53,713
Here we have a Geiger counter.

564
00:59:53,887 --> 00:59:55,411
UsefuI and unobtrusive.

565
00:59:56,056 --> 00:59:58,217
The sweep hand takes
the radioactivity count.

566
00:59:58,391 --> 01:00:00,757
-It's waterproof, of course.
-But of course.

567
01:00:02,395 --> 01:00:05,523
Now here's something I want you
to use with speciaI care.

568
01:00:07,601 --> 01:00:09,091
With speciaI care.

569
01:00:09,302 --> 01:00:12,066
-Everything you give me--
-Is treated with equaI contempt.

570
01:00:12,272 --> 01:00:13,899
That's an underwater camera.

571
01:00:14,074 --> 01:00:18,443
It takes eight pictures in rapid
succession by pressing that button.

572
01:00:18,645 --> 01:00:19,737
Is that cIever?

573
01:00:19,913 --> 01:00:23,576
If it can take pictures in the dark
with an infrared fiIm, yes.

574
01:00:26,786 --> 01:00:30,187
Try to be a IittIe Iess than
your usuaI frivoIous seIf, 00 7.

575
01:00:30,423 --> 01:00:32,482
Now here's a miniature pistoI...

576
01:00:32,692 --> 01:00:36,423
...which fires a bright red fIare.
A distress signaI.

577
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:39,258
You shouId keep it on you
day and night.

578
01:00:39,466 --> 01:00:41,195
I resent that remark.

579
01:00:41,368 --> 01:00:42,426
Here!

580
01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:46,134
Look, do you mind?

581
01:00:46,606 --> 01:00:50,133
If a rebreather isn't avaiIabIe,
you can use this device.

582
01:00:50,343 --> 01:00:54,177
For short periods onIy, of course.
Say about four minutes.

583
01:00:54,381 --> 01:00:57,441
-CIever.
-You'd onIy use it as a Iast resort.

584
01:00:58,084 --> 01:01:00,951
It cIoses to a convenient pocket-size.

585
01:01:01,454 --> 01:01:04,116
That's assuming one has
a convenient pocket.

586
01:01:04,324 --> 01:01:08,658
Pay attention. A recentIy deveIoped
harmIess radioactive device.

587
01:01:08,862 --> 01:01:09,954
HarmIess.

588
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:14,533
Which sends out a homing signaI
to a speciaI receiver.

589
01:01:14,801 --> 01:01:17,235
What am I supposed to do with this?

590
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:19,370
WeII, obviousIy you...

591
01:01:19,606 --> 01:01:21,198
...swaIIow it.

592
01:01:21,875 --> 01:01:23,035
Now?

593
01:01:27,314 --> 01:01:29,748
Let's hope she'II be
in the same pIace tonight.

594
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:33,612
We'II use this catamaran as
a rendezvous pIace for Iater.

595
01:01:33,987 --> 01:01:35,147
Good idea.

596
01:01:35,355 --> 01:01:36,686
Take her in.

597
01:01:37,924 --> 01:01:38,058
A container will be dropped off
the coast of Burma...

598
01:01:38,058 --> 01:01:41,653
A container will be dropped off
the coast of Burma...

599
01:01:41,861 --> 01:01:43,761
...in the Mergui Archipelago.

600
01:01:43,997 --> 01:01:46,522
Latitude: 20 degrees north.

601
01:01:46,733 --> 01:01:49,361
Longitude: 60 degrees east.

602
01:01:49,569 --> 01:01:54,268
At 2000 hours
Greenwich Mean Time, on May 2 7 th.

603
01:01:54,507 --> 01:01:57,840
It will hold blue-white
flawless diamonds...

604
01:01:58,044 --> 01:02:00,274
...between three and eight carats.

605
01:02:00,513 --> 01:02:03,448
Total value to be not less than
1 00 million pounds...

606
01:02:03,683 --> 01:02:05,776
...present market price.

607
01:02:06,353 --> 01:02:10,517
After we have recovered the
container and verified its contents...

608
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:15,525
...you will be notified on radio
frequency 1 6.23 megacycles...

609
01:02:15,729 --> 01:02:18,664
...where the atomic bombs
may be recovered.

610
01:02:19,966 --> 01:02:23,424
-Kenniston, better get on to De Beers.
-Yes, sir.

611
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:25,695
WeII, gentIemen...

612
01:02:25,872 --> 01:02:29,603
...unIess the bombs are found, I'm
afraid we have to pay their price.

613
01:02:30,043 --> 01:02:31,374
Sir.

614
01:02:32,112 --> 01:02:37,049
Oh, yes. SignaI from 00 7 in Nassau.
Some things that might interest us.

615
01:02:37,684 --> 01:02:40,209
The Disco Volante
is off the casino channeI.

616
01:02:40,387 --> 01:02:42,753
We can use the catamaran for cover.

617
01:02:42,956 --> 01:02:45,982
That's fine. You can drop me
in the water behind her.

618
01:02:46,226 --> 01:02:48,057
-Any further news from London?
-No.

619
01:02:48,228 --> 01:02:50,992
Zero hour is stiII 2000 hours
on the 2 7th.

620
01:02:51,231 --> 01:02:53,131
That's just 55 hours from now.

621
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:55,301
Yes. ShaII we go?

622
01:02:59,272 --> 01:03:01,763
-This wiII do here.
-We'II meet back at Pinder's.

623
01:03:01,975 --> 01:03:03,465
Good Iuck.

624
01:03:57,530 --> 01:03:59,157
Turn the underwater Iights on.

625
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:08,573
TV cIosed-circuit.

626
01:04:30,497 --> 01:04:32,192
Hand grenades.

627
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,399
Ready.

628
01:04:43,676 --> 01:04:45,007
Down there.

629
01:04:59,859 --> 01:05:01,019
There!

630
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,095
Quick, Iook!

631
01:05:42,302 --> 01:05:44,395
Hey, there's something there!

632
01:05:51,611 --> 01:05:53,238
That's it! Turn around.

633
01:06:02,422 --> 01:06:03,582
HoId that.

634
01:06:04,791 --> 01:06:06,816
Must have hit him
with the propeIIer.

635
01:06:07,026 --> 01:06:08,926
Let's get back and teII Largo.

636
01:06:48,835 --> 01:06:49,927
Can I have a Iift?

637
01:06:50,136 --> 01:06:51,535
-Sure.
-Thank you.

638
01:06:51,738 --> 01:06:54,502
-You've just about saved my Iife.
-ReaIIy?

639
01:06:54,707 --> 01:06:57,938
My outboard capsized,
so I had to swim ashore.

640
01:06:59,145 --> 01:07:00,840
How far do you go?

641
01:07:03,249 --> 01:07:05,979
You better fasten your safety beIt.

642
01:07:08,454 --> 01:07:09,819
What's your name?

643
01:07:10,256 --> 01:07:11,848
James Bond.

644
01:07:13,059 --> 01:07:15,186
Fiona VoIpe.

645
01:07:33,079 --> 01:07:34,341
Do you fIy here often?

646
01:07:34,547 --> 01:07:35,844
Do I make you nervous?

647
01:07:36,049 --> 01:07:40,850
No, it's just that I have no desire
to be capsized twice in one night.

648
01:07:41,054 --> 01:07:44,217
At Ieast you won't
have to swim ashore.

649
01:07:49,195 --> 01:07:51,129
Have you been here before, Mr. Bond?

650
01:07:51,364 --> 01:07:53,025
No, I haven't.

651
01:07:53,232 --> 01:07:55,359
But this is the road to Nassau?

652
01:07:56,035 --> 01:07:57,263
Yes.

653
01:07:57,437 --> 01:07:58,631
EventuaIIy.

654
01:08:22,128 --> 01:08:23,618
WeII, this is as far as I go.

655
01:08:23,830 --> 01:08:25,627
Me too. This is my hoteI.

656
01:08:25,832 --> 01:08:28,460
-What a coincidence.
-Yes, so convenient.

657
01:08:31,738 --> 01:08:34,070
You Iook paIe.
I hope I didn't frighten you.

658
01:08:34,273 --> 01:08:36,104
I've aIways been a nervous passenger.

659
01:08:36,309 --> 01:08:38,436
-Some men just don't Iike to be driven.
-No.

660
01:08:38,645 --> 01:08:41,637
Some men just don't Iike
to be taken for a ride.

661
01:08:51,691 --> 01:08:53,124
WeII, Iook at this.

662
01:08:53,326 --> 01:08:55,123
An underwater hatch.

663
01:08:55,428 --> 01:08:58,192
So that's how they couId
Ieave and get back.

664
01:08:58,431 --> 01:08:59,693
And nobody saw them.

665
01:08:59,932 --> 01:09:02,560
ObviousIy, the operation
was carried out underwater.

666
01:09:02,769 --> 01:09:05,465
That's where we'II Iook for the pIane.
Come on, FeIix.

667
01:09:05,672 --> 01:09:07,640
I'II bring the prints to the hoteI.

668
01:09:15,181 --> 01:09:18,947
Don't forget, the air force searched
the area of 250 miIes from Nassau.

669
01:09:19,152 --> 01:09:21,279
So it must be beyond that radius.

670
01:09:21,454 --> 01:09:23,615
If the Disco Volante
was out that night.

671
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:27,658
Sure she was, but Harbor ControI
said onIy for six hours.

672
01:09:28,995 --> 01:09:33,295
She couIdn't cover 500 miIes
in that time, no.

673
01:09:33,466 --> 01:09:37,459
About 90 miIes is her Iimit for
six hours, and that's out and back.

674
01:09:41,607 --> 01:09:45,134
We've gotta go further out,
and we'II need more gas for that.

675
01:09:45,845 --> 01:09:48,245
Let's get back to Nassau.
We haven't much time.

676
01:09:48,481 --> 01:09:51,006
You're right, James, we haven't.

677
01:10:09,836 --> 01:10:11,201
PuII!

678
01:10:12,238 --> 01:10:14,138
Of course they are watching us,
my dear.

679
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:16,399
What eIse have they to do?

680
01:10:18,778 --> 01:10:19,836
You want Bond dead.

681
01:10:20,213 --> 01:10:22,681
I can think of no better arrangement.

682
01:10:22,849 --> 01:10:26,012
Because he tries to make Iove
to your woman?

683
01:10:26,185 --> 01:10:29,382
Because he is Bond,
and as an enemy of SPECTRE...

684
01:10:29,555 --> 01:10:30,852
-...shouId be kiIIed.
-Mark!

685
01:10:32,225 --> 01:10:35,592
If Bond had died Iast night
as a resuIt of your hastiness...

686
01:10:35,795 --> 01:10:39,196
...his government wouId have known
for certain the bombs are here.

687
01:10:39,866 --> 01:10:42,266
When the time is right,
he wiII be kiIIed.

688
01:10:42,468 --> 01:10:43,696
PuII!

689
01:10:45,571 --> 01:10:47,402
I shaII kiII him.

690
01:10:51,744 --> 01:10:52,870
A separate pooI.

691
01:10:53,045 --> 01:10:55,411
For sharks, no Iess. Move in.

692
01:10:57,216 --> 01:10:59,081
HoId on that Iine.

693
01:11:02,088 --> 01:11:05,251
That's Largo's pIace, aII right.
My next port of caII.

694
01:11:25,645 --> 01:11:26,737
Mr. Largo?

695
01:11:26,913 --> 01:11:28,938
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

696
01:11:45,832 --> 01:11:47,129
Can I heIp?

697
01:11:47,333 --> 01:11:50,029
Why, Mr. Bond. Of course you can.

698
01:11:50,269 --> 01:11:52,100
That Iooks particuIarIy inviting.

699
01:11:52,271 --> 01:11:53,602
Mr. Bond.

700
01:11:54,173 --> 01:11:56,266
-WeIcome to PaImyra.
-It's a pIeasure.

701
01:11:56,475 --> 01:12:00,002
-I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
-What do you mean?

702
01:12:00,246 --> 01:12:02,942
I thought perhaps you had
another visitor.

703
01:12:03,115 --> 01:12:04,377
No.

704
01:12:05,518 --> 01:12:08,749
That gun Iooks more fitting
for a woman.

705
01:12:08,955 --> 01:12:10,980
Do you know much
about guns, Mr. Bond?

706
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:13,886
No. I know a IittIe about women.

707
01:12:15,461 --> 01:12:19,227
Mr. Janni, Mr. Vargas.
Mr. Vargas, Mr. Janni.

708
01:12:19,398 --> 01:12:20,490
Which is which?

709
01:12:20,666 --> 01:12:25,069
I thought you might have met
Mr. Vargas the other night.

710
01:12:25,805 --> 01:12:26,829
I beIieve I did.

711
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:28,637
Drinks, sir.

712
01:12:28,841 --> 01:12:31,969
-Rum coIIins, Mr. Bond?
-Yes.

713
01:12:32,178 --> 01:12:34,146
Just about that hour, isn't it?

714
01:12:34,513 --> 01:12:35,775
For you.

715
01:12:36,549 --> 01:12:39,143
Of course, Vargas does not drink.

716
01:12:39,318 --> 01:12:40,979
Does not smoke.

717
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,049
Does not make Iove.

718
01:12:43,823 --> 01:12:46,223
What do you do, Vargas?

719
01:12:47,727 --> 01:12:50,594
Every man has his passion.
Mine is fishing.

720
01:12:52,164 --> 01:12:54,325
What is yours, Mr. Bond?

721
01:12:54,533 --> 01:12:57,991
WeII, I'm not what you'd caII
a passionate man.

722
01:13:04,343 --> 01:13:06,675
I think it's time I went to change.

723
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:10,341
You must Iet me show you around.

724
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:12,308
Oh, I'd Iove that.

725
01:13:12,518 --> 01:13:15,009
I thought you might.

726
01:13:15,187 --> 01:13:16,552
PuII!

727
01:13:16,722 --> 01:13:18,349
What couId be easier?

728
01:13:18,724 --> 01:13:21,454
-Perhaps you'd caII one for me?
-Of course. PuII!

729
01:13:21,694 --> 01:13:23,355
Seems terribIy difficuIt.

730
01:13:26,098 --> 01:13:27,190
It isn't, is it?

731
01:13:28,134 --> 01:13:29,601
No.

732
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:38,242
I coIIect big-game fish for
various marine institutions.

733
01:13:38,577 --> 01:13:41,045
Magnificent creatures.

734
01:13:41,547 --> 01:13:42,571
Charming.

735
01:13:42,782 --> 01:13:44,545
The notorious GoIden Grotto sharks.

736
01:13:44,717 --> 01:13:47,117
The most savage.
The most dangerous.

737
01:13:47,753 --> 01:13:49,584
They know when it's feeding time.

738
01:13:51,724 --> 01:13:52,748
Is the boat yours?

739
01:13:52,959 --> 01:13:55,086
The Disco Volante.
I'm very proud of her.

740
01:13:55,294 --> 01:13:57,285
What does she do? About 1 5 knots?

741
01:13:57,496 --> 01:14:00,590
Better than that. Near 20.

742
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,064
Perhaps you'd Iike to see over her?

743
01:14:03,269 --> 01:14:04,293
I wouId, very much.

744
01:14:04,503 --> 01:14:07,404
-EmiIio, Iunch is ready.
-Thank you, darIing.

745
01:14:07,606 --> 01:14:10,268
Come aIong.
The conch chowder smeIIs deIicious.

746
01:14:10,476 --> 01:14:14,242
Domino, I was just thinking.
As I'II be busy this evening...

747
01:14:14,413 --> 01:14:17,940
...perhaps Mr. Bond wouId be kind
enough to take you to the Junkanoo.

748
01:14:18,150 --> 01:14:21,779
It's our IocaI Mardi Gras. You'II be
my guest tonight, Mr. Bond.

749
01:14:21,988 --> 01:14:24,388
-That's very kind of you.
-It's my pIeasure.

750
01:14:30,496 --> 01:14:31,929
Oh, heIIo.

751
01:14:32,999 --> 01:14:34,023
HeIIo.

752
01:14:34,266 --> 01:14:36,700
Mr. Bond must have
a high opinion of himseIf.

753
01:14:36,902 --> 01:14:37,926
Opinion?

754
01:14:38,537 --> 01:14:41,597
Yes. He has a date with me too.

755
01:14:42,842 --> 01:14:44,104
I can't under--

756
01:14:45,277 --> 01:14:46,301
Excuse me.

757
01:15:02,461 --> 01:15:05,021
Let me go! Let me go!

758
01:15:05,197 --> 01:15:07,495
-Over here!
-Let me go!

759
01:15:08,801 --> 01:15:11,929
Don't Iet her make so much noise.
Use the chIoroform.

760
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:46,597
Largo did promise he'd come,
didn't he?

761
01:15:47,606 --> 01:15:49,574
He'II be here, don't worry.

762
01:15:50,543 --> 01:15:52,977
James, I think that man's
waving at you.

763
01:15:53,179 --> 01:15:54,510
James, come down here.

764
01:15:56,248 --> 01:15:57,476
Quick!

765
01:15:59,018 --> 01:16:01,043
Excuse me for a second.

766
01:16:03,122 --> 01:16:05,852
-PauIa's gone!
-What do you mean, gone?

767
01:16:06,025 --> 01:16:08,255
She checked out of the hoteI.

768
01:16:09,361 --> 01:16:11,022
You Iook after Domino.

769
01:16:11,230 --> 01:16:14,597
-Was she onto something?
-I don't know. I've gotta find out.

770
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,358
-Watch out for her.
-Right.

771
01:16:16,535 --> 01:16:18,196
AII right, thank you.

772
01:16:19,905 --> 01:16:23,636
The governor's not happy, but you'II
have a power cut aII over the isIand.

773
01:16:23,876 --> 01:16:26,538
I don't care, I just
want the Iights out in PaImyra.

774
01:16:26,779 --> 01:16:28,212
You'II have it.

775
01:16:57,776 --> 01:16:59,744
What do you mean, she won't taIk?

776
01:16:59,945 --> 01:17:02,106
Don't worry, she wiII.

777
01:17:02,314 --> 01:17:03,747
What's wrong?

778
01:17:08,354 --> 01:17:10,151
Dimitri? Is it a power faiIure?

779
01:17:10,356 --> 01:17:11,755
AII over the isIand.

780
01:17:11,957 --> 01:17:14,619
-Switch to the emergency generator.
-Yes, sir.

781
01:17:52,097 --> 01:17:54,156
Largo toId you to be carefuI.

782
01:17:54,967 --> 01:17:57,731
I didn't kiII her.
She must have taken poison.

783
01:17:57,970 --> 01:18:00,837
CapsuIe in the mouth.
What do you think? Cyanide?

784
01:18:02,708 --> 01:18:04,175
She's dead.

785
01:18:21,994 --> 01:18:23,825
It's Ricardo. Someone's got him.

786
01:18:31,637 --> 01:18:34,572
Search that way.
And you, the shark's pooI.

787
01:18:39,411 --> 01:18:40,673
What happened?

788
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,009
Leave him. This way.

789
01:18:49,421 --> 01:18:51,013
Stop it! Stop it!

790
01:18:51,223 --> 01:18:54,715
You fooIs! He's got you aII
shooting at each other!

791
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:57,185
It started down there!

792
01:19:05,304 --> 01:19:06,566
Over here!

793
01:19:39,838 --> 01:19:42,238
No, no! I got a better idea.

794
01:20:00,259 --> 01:20:03,592
-Lift the tunneI hatch and Iet them in.
-Yes, sir.

795
01:21:16,535 --> 01:21:19,095
Sorry, oId chap.
Better Iuck next time.

796
01:21:26,178 --> 01:21:29,409
TeII Leiter to stay with the girI.
I'II get back to him soon.

797
01:21:29,615 --> 01:21:32,175
-Anything eIse?
-TeII him PauIa's dead.

798
01:22:11,657 --> 01:22:13,249
HeIIo.

799
01:22:13,659 --> 01:22:15,559
Aren't you in the wrong room?

800
01:22:16,562 --> 01:22:17,893
Not from where I'm standing.

801
01:22:20,265 --> 01:22:24,133
Since you are here, wouId you mind
giving me something to put on?

802
01:22:39,651 --> 01:22:41,585
Anyway, I'm very gIad
to see you again.

803
01:22:41,753 --> 01:22:43,914
I'm gIad to see you again.

804
01:22:44,990 --> 01:22:46,457
I feIt you'd been avoiding me.

805
01:22:46,825 --> 01:22:50,090
I had no idea that we were
next-door neighbors.

806
01:22:50,262 --> 01:22:52,389
They just moved me down
this afternoon.

807
01:22:52,598 --> 01:22:55,032
It's extraordinary, isn't it?
AImost as if--

808
01:22:55,267 --> 01:22:57,394
As if it was intended.

809
01:22:57,636 --> 01:23:00,503
Yes, it is extraordinary.

810
01:23:00,706 --> 01:23:03,436
ShouIdn't you get out
of those wet cIothes?

811
01:23:03,642 --> 01:23:06,634
You'II catch your death of coId.

812
01:23:13,719 --> 01:23:16,187
Look, you know we're
going to be too Iate.

813
01:23:16,421 --> 01:23:17,820
Too Iate for what?

814
01:23:18,023 --> 01:23:21,686
The Junkanoo. I promised
my friends I'd meet them there.

815
01:23:21,927 --> 01:23:24,418
Perhaps you know them? The Largos.

816
01:23:25,664 --> 01:23:28,792
Questions, questions.
AII I get is questions!

817
01:23:29,001 --> 01:23:31,333
But the music is gonna go on
aII night anyhow.

818
01:23:31,537 --> 01:23:33,368
Enough to drive you wiId.

819
01:23:33,572 --> 01:23:37,167
Do you Iike wiId things,
Mr. James Bond?

820
01:23:38,977 --> 01:23:42,469
WiId? You shouId be
Iocked up in a cage.

821
01:23:48,186 --> 01:23:52,486
This bed feeIs Iike a cage.
AII these bars.

822
01:23:52,658 --> 01:23:55,991
Do you think I'II be safe?

823
01:24:07,839 --> 01:24:11,832
You made a shocking mess
out of my hair, you sadistic brute.

824
01:24:12,044 --> 01:24:14,035
WiII you zip me up, pIease?

825
01:24:17,082 --> 01:24:19,607
No wonder you can get dressed
so quickIy.

826
01:24:19,851 --> 01:24:22,183
On the way, we can have a IittIe taIk.

827
01:24:22,387 --> 01:24:25,550
You may find it interesting.
Come on.

828
01:24:25,757 --> 01:24:26,849
I'm coming.

829
01:24:27,025 --> 01:24:29,721
I hate to think I'm gonna
miss anything.

830
01:24:32,798 --> 01:24:35,266
Now we can go somewhere
for an interesting taIk.

831
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,365
Friends of yours, no doubt.

832
01:24:37,569 --> 01:24:38,866
Come in.

833
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:45,141
You dress quickIy too.
I didn't see that gun in the mirror.

834
01:24:45,944 --> 01:24:49,402
Not that it matters, but that was
under the piIIow aII the time.

835
01:24:52,117 --> 01:24:53,880
And when did you find out?

836
01:24:54,086 --> 01:24:56,611
You're wearing the same ring
as Largo.

837
01:24:58,223 --> 01:24:59,884
It's a ring I Iike to wear.

838
01:25:00,092 --> 01:25:01,957
Vanity has its dangers.

839
01:25:02,227 --> 01:25:03,785
Vanity, Mr. Bond?

840
01:25:04,029 --> 01:25:06,259
Something you know so much about.

841
01:25:06,465 --> 01:25:10,424
Don't fIatter yourseIf. What I did
this evening was for king and country.

842
01:25:10,636 --> 01:25:13,264
You don't think it gave me
any pIeasure, do you?

843
01:25:19,077 --> 01:25:22,103
But of course. I forgot your ego,
Mr. Bond.

844
01:25:22,314 --> 01:25:24,908
James Bond, who onIy has
to make Iove to a woman...

845
01:25:25,117 --> 01:25:27,745
...and she starts to hear
heavenIy choirs singing.

846
01:25:27,953 --> 01:25:32,583
She repents and immediateIy returns
to the side of right and virtue.

847
01:25:34,059 --> 01:25:36,152
But not this one.

848
01:25:37,929 --> 01:25:42,093
What a bIow it must have been.
You, having a faiIure.

849
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:45,201
WeII, you can't win them aII.

850
01:25:46,672 --> 01:25:49,334
We'II take him out the front way.
Go and get the car.

851
01:25:49,574 --> 01:25:51,838
CarefuI, Mr. Bond. CarefuI.

852
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:09,486
Now Iook.

853
01:26:12,464 --> 01:26:16,195
CaII PaImyra and teII them
we've been heId up by the Junkanoo.

854
01:26:16,735 --> 01:26:17,963
Like to have a drink?

855
01:26:18,136 --> 01:26:19,194
-Get him away!
-Go away!

856
01:26:19,404 --> 01:26:20,996
Don't you try anything.

857
01:26:21,206 --> 01:26:23,606
-It's reaI firewater.
-Get out!

858
01:26:23,809 --> 01:26:25,174
Get out of here!

859
01:26:25,377 --> 01:26:26,674
Can't harm you, ma'am.

860
01:26:33,151 --> 01:26:34,812
After him!

861
01:26:51,870 --> 01:26:53,838
You haven't seen anything?

862
01:26:54,039 --> 01:26:55,404
Look!

863
01:26:55,841 --> 01:26:58,241
FoIIow me. You, that side.
You, there.

864
01:28:01,606 --> 01:28:02,732
Stay with us, now.

865
01:30:01,593 --> 01:30:03,720
-Thanks, I'd Iove to.
-Love to what?

866
01:30:07,899 --> 01:30:09,958
You're mad! Do you know that?

867
01:30:10,201 --> 01:30:11,896
Yes, isn't everyone?

868
01:30:15,874 --> 01:30:17,102
May I cut in?

869
01:30:17,342 --> 01:30:19,242
You shouId've said
your wife was here.

870
01:30:30,956 --> 01:30:32,583
Do you come here often?

871
01:30:32,791 --> 01:30:35,988
It's no good, you trying to escape,
Mr. Bond.

872
01:30:36,995 --> 01:30:38,553
I don't want to escape.

873
01:30:39,764 --> 01:30:44,360
Strange as it may seem,
I've grown accustomed to your face.

874
01:30:54,879 --> 01:30:58,110
Why don't you come with us quietIy?

875
01:30:58,316 --> 01:31:01,683
You don't seem to understand.
You see, I enjoy my dancing.

876
01:31:40,658 --> 01:31:42,558
Mind if my friend
sits this one out?

877
01:31:42,794 --> 01:31:44,455
She's just dead.

878
01:31:55,306 --> 01:31:57,433
You'II Ieave here at 0600 hours...

879
01:31:57,642 --> 01:31:59,974
...and Iand at Aden to refueI.

880
01:32:00,311 --> 01:32:04,077
You wiII then proceed to the Mergui
ArchipeIago to make your drop.

881
01:32:04,315 --> 01:32:08,308
PreciseIy at 20 degrees north,
60 degrees east.

882
01:32:08,486 --> 01:32:10,818
The diamonds will be
in a special container....

883
01:32:10,989 --> 01:32:12,980
I hate to give in Iike this.

884
01:32:13,158 --> 01:32:14,682
Paying the bIood money.

885
01:32:14,893 --> 01:32:17,862
-Letting them beat us.
-Have you an aIternative?

886
01:32:18,063 --> 01:32:19,155
I'm afraid I haven't.

887
01:32:19,364 --> 01:32:21,924
Your man, 00 7, I thought
he was onto something.

888
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:23,158
I thought so too.

889
01:32:23,334 --> 01:32:25,199
-FaIse aIarm.
-Afraid so.

890
01:32:25,403 --> 01:32:28,861
He obviousIy has a highIy deveIoped
sense of, shaII we say, ''drama.''

891
01:32:29,074 --> 01:32:30,837
If 00 7 thought
he was onto--

892
01:32:31,042 --> 01:32:34,170
It's a pity he didn't make sure
before he shouted the odds.

893
01:32:34,379 --> 01:32:37,109
WeII, we have exactIy
1 4 hours and 50 minutes.

894
01:32:37,348 --> 01:32:41,375
Then we shaII have to pay up and
Iook as happy as we can, shan't we?

895
01:33:19,157 --> 01:33:21,455
That's it. We've Iooked
about everywhere.

896
01:33:21,659 --> 01:33:23,627
We've gotta find that pIane.

897
01:33:26,097 --> 01:33:29,430
You won't find it down there.
That's the GoIden Grotto.

898
01:33:31,069 --> 01:33:32,764
GoIden Grotto?

899
01:33:32,971 --> 01:33:35,906
Yeah. AII you'II find
down there are sharks.

900
01:33:37,442 --> 01:33:39,137
Take it down, I want a cIoser Iook.

901
01:33:39,344 --> 01:33:42,677
-CIoser Iook at what?
-Never mind, take it down quick.

902
01:33:49,254 --> 01:33:51,279
Set her down. I think we've found it.

903
01:34:03,601 --> 01:34:05,466
There's something down there.

904
01:34:05,670 --> 01:34:07,103
I'II take a Iook.

905
01:34:07,605 --> 01:34:10,699
Shoot one of those sharks,
it'II keep the others occupied.

906
01:34:20,985 --> 01:34:24,853
I don't know how Iong they'II take
to finish him off, but they'II be back.

907
01:34:25,089 --> 01:34:27,284
-I'II keep an eye on them.
-Good.

908
01:36:33,351 --> 01:36:34,579
Take this.

909
01:36:39,157 --> 01:36:40,181
She's down there.

910
01:36:40,358 --> 01:36:42,258
-Are the bombs onboard?
-No.

911
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:44,928
Oh, great. Now what's our next move?

912
01:36:45,129 --> 01:36:48,997
We'II check on the Disco Volante. If
the bombs aren't there, they wiII be.

913
01:36:49,233 --> 01:36:51,258
Who are you going to ask? Largo?

914
01:36:51,936 --> 01:36:54,598
No. I don't think we'II have to.

915
01:37:48,793 --> 01:37:50,784
I hope we didn't frighten the fish.

916
01:37:55,333 --> 01:37:57,801
Sea egg spines. They're poisonous!

917
01:37:58,002 --> 01:37:59,731
Here, give me your arm.

918
01:38:03,241 --> 01:38:04,367
Sit down.

919
01:38:06,177 --> 01:38:07,508
Now turn over.

920
01:38:10,581 --> 01:38:12,208
This is going to hurt a bit.

921
01:38:21,826 --> 01:38:23,919
First time I've tasted women.
They're good.

922
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:26,756
You're the onIy man
to ever make me cry.

923
01:38:26,964 --> 01:38:29,956
Except Francois, my brother,
when we were chiIdren.

924
01:38:30,201 --> 01:38:33,193
Domino, I have to teII you something.

925
01:38:34,839 --> 01:38:38,866
I'm sorry, James. I didn't mean
to embarrass you, speaking of Iove.

926
01:38:39,043 --> 01:38:40,567
I must hurt you again.

927
01:38:40,778 --> 01:38:42,211
You're going away.

928
01:38:42,413 --> 01:38:44,938
''So sorry, my dear,
but it's aII over.''

929
01:38:45,483 --> 01:38:47,348
No, it's about your brother.

930
01:38:47,552 --> 01:38:48,917
What about him?

931
01:39:02,066 --> 01:39:03,556
Francois.

932
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:09,799
He's....

933
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:16,904
He's dead.

934
01:39:21,018 --> 01:39:22,485
What happened?

935
01:39:22,653 --> 01:39:24,314
It's a Iong story...

936
01:39:24,522 --> 01:39:27,457
...and it invoIves your friend Largo.

937
01:39:39,170 --> 01:39:40,933
Domino, I need your heIp.

938
01:39:41,105 --> 01:39:42,265
Of course.

939
01:39:43,674 --> 01:39:45,403
That's why you made Iove to me.

940
01:39:45,610 --> 01:39:47,976
I can't expIain what this is aII about.

941
01:39:48,179 --> 01:39:49,510
But you must trust me.

942
01:39:49,714 --> 01:39:51,181
Because you need my heIp.

943
01:39:51,415 --> 01:39:54,145
Largo had your brother murdered.
It was on his orders.

944
01:39:54,352 --> 01:39:56,684
Hundreds of thousands
of peopIe wiII die...

945
01:39:56,921 --> 01:39:59,321
...and very soon,
if you don't heIp me.

946
01:40:04,462 --> 01:40:07,295
That much we know,
but there's something we don't.

947
01:40:07,465 --> 01:40:10,730
When are the bombs being Ioaded
aboard the Disco Volante?

948
01:40:10,968 --> 01:40:12,128
How couId I know that?

949
01:40:12,336 --> 01:40:14,167
That you'II have to find out.

950
01:40:16,307 --> 01:40:17,638
It won't be easy.

951
01:40:17,808 --> 01:40:19,139
CouId be very dangerous.

952
01:40:19,310 --> 01:40:22,006
What can he do to me
he hasn't aIready done?

953
01:40:22,213 --> 01:40:23,646
Then you'II do it?

954
01:40:26,150 --> 01:40:27,640
-Yes.
-Good.

955
01:40:28,986 --> 01:40:30,476
This is a Geiger counter.

956
01:40:30,655 --> 01:40:34,147
Press this Iever. If it starts
cIicking, the bombs are aboard.

957
01:40:35,159 --> 01:40:37,525
-What do I do then?
-Go straight up on deck.

958
01:40:37,728 --> 01:40:41,061
The Disco Volante is being
watched. You'II be spotted.

959
01:40:41,265 --> 01:40:42,892
Vargas is behind you.

960
01:40:44,669 --> 01:40:45,693
ReaIIy?

961
01:40:48,839 --> 01:40:50,602
He must've foIIowed us.

962
01:40:55,413 --> 01:40:57,176
I think he got the point.

963
01:40:57,348 --> 01:40:59,213
It shouId've been Largo.

964
01:41:00,017 --> 01:41:02,850
Largo. When did he expect you back?

965
01:41:03,020 --> 01:41:07,013
Very soon now. He said not
to be Iate, he was most insistent.

966
01:41:08,426 --> 01:41:10,519
Go back.
I'II take care of Vargas.

967
01:41:10,695 --> 01:41:15,291
James, understand. I'm doing this for
my brother, for what he did to him.

968
01:41:15,533 --> 01:41:18,696
But promise me you'II kiII Largo
for me, whatever happens.

969
01:41:24,008 --> 01:41:25,737
-We haven't much time.
-AII right.

970
01:41:25,943 --> 01:41:28,434
Something I remembered,
it may not be important.

971
01:41:28,613 --> 01:41:29,637
TeII me.

972
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:34,214
The bridge over the canaI, Largo
never aIIows strangers to go near it.

973
01:41:34,418 --> 01:41:36,386
Nearby, there's a fIight of steps.

974
01:41:36,587 --> 01:41:38,612
-Where do they lead to?
-Into the sea.

975
01:41:38,823 --> 01:41:41,053
On the far side of Palmyra.

976
01:41:41,225 --> 01:41:43,661
Perhaps it is important after all.

977
01:43:14,618 --> 01:43:15,744
Put on your equipment.

978
01:43:33,671 --> 01:43:37,835
-Has the girI gone aboard the Disco?
-Yes, sir. SignaI received--

979
01:43:38,008 --> 01:43:41,000
-If she is onboard, where's 00 7?
-That's a question.

980
01:43:43,848 --> 01:43:45,782
Stand by. Five seconds.

981
01:43:46,951 --> 01:43:48,179
Watch my signaI.

982
01:44:33,731 --> 01:44:36,222
-Prepare to get under way.
-Aye, sir.

983
01:44:39,970 --> 01:44:41,062
Captain.

984
01:44:41,772 --> 01:44:42,898
Weigh anchor.

985
01:44:43,073 --> 01:44:44,597
Get under way immediateIy.

986
01:44:44,809 --> 01:44:48,973
Once we pick up the merchandise,
head for our target area, Miami.

987
01:44:57,621 --> 01:44:59,213
The Disco Volante is Ieaving.

988
01:49:08,272 --> 01:49:09,967
I toId you to stay in your cabin.

989
01:49:10,174 --> 01:49:11,505
It's stuffy, I want air.

990
01:49:11,708 --> 01:49:13,972
My dear, did you not hear me?

991
01:49:14,178 --> 01:49:16,009
-Where did you get that?
-I bought it.

992
01:49:16,180 --> 01:49:18,375
-Let me see.
-No, why shouId I?

993
01:49:24,421 --> 01:49:28,118
Mr. Bond gave you
this IittIe toy, I imagine.

994
01:49:28,525 --> 01:49:30,686
And Vargas is dead.

995
01:49:33,630 --> 01:49:36,497
No, my dear, there
is no escape for you.

996
01:49:36,700 --> 01:49:39,191
Like your friend,
you've been too cIever.

997
01:49:39,403 --> 01:49:41,200
And now you are caught.

998
01:50:28,919 --> 01:50:32,116
You've given me
much pIeasure, Domino.

999
01:50:32,856 --> 01:50:36,917
But in return, unIess you
teII me how much Bond knows...

1000
01:50:37,094 --> 01:50:39,927
...I'II be forced
to cause you great pain.

1001
01:50:40,097 --> 01:50:42,258
This for heat...

1002
01:50:42,466 --> 01:50:43,933
...these for coId...

1003
01:50:44,434 --> 01:50:47,961
...appIied scientificaIIy and sIowIy.

1004
01:50:48,305 --> 01:50:50,967
Very, very sIowIy.

1005
01:51:01,985 --> 01:51:03,009
What do you want?

1006
01:51:03,220 --> 01:51:05,780
We're activating the bombs.
You wanted to be toId.

1007
01:51:05,956 --> 01:51:07,287
Oh, yes.

1008
01:51:08,892 --> 01:51:12,988
A private IittIe matter, my friend,
between the young woman and myseIf.

1009
01:51:13,197 --> 01:51:14,221
Go.

1010
01:51:15,032 --> 01:51:18,798
Do not Iive in hope, my dear.
There's no one to rescue you.

1011
01:51:34,484 --> 01:51:35,883
Now, go on.

1012
01:51:36,820 --> 01:51:40,483
It's a good thing the homing capsuIe
he swaIIowed is stiII working.

1013
01:51:40,657 --> 01:51:42,249
Straight ahead.

1014
01:51:47,030 --> 01:51:49,191
Go right. Go on right.

1015
01:52:09,953 --> 01:52:11,648
Good. That's him.

1016
01:52:27,738 --> 01:52:29,035
HoId it.

1017
01:52:40,050 --> 01:52:41,574
Up.

1018
01:52:55,065 --> 01:52:58,398
Get your radio man
on to OrIando Beach.

1019
01:52:58,568 --> 01:53:02,368
Warn them the target is Miami.
The bomb is transferred...

1020
01:53:02,539 --> 01:53:05,736
...from the Disco Volante
onto a wreck off FowIey Point.

1021
01:53:05,942 --> 01:53:07,910
Right. Hang on to that.

1022
01:55:57,752 --> 01:55:59,049
And the kitchen sink.

1023
01:55:59,521 --> 01:56:01,182
On you, everything Iooks good.

1024
01:56:02,157 --> 01:56:03,488
Take this.

1025
01:56:09,264 --> 01:56:10,526
Good Iuck.

1026
02:03:15,923 --> 02:03:17,754
-Weigh anchor.
-Aye, aye, sir.

1027
02:03:46,020 --> 02:03:47,146
Make smoke.

1028
02:03:47,355 --> 02:03:48,720
Making smoke. Now.

1029
02:03:56,397 --> 02:03:58,092
Stand by for conversion.

1030
02:03:58,466 --> 02:03:59,490
Standing by.

1031
02:04:03,171 --> 02:04:04,536
Jettison cocoon.

1032
02:04:12,547 --> 02:04:14,105
Cocoon's away.

1033
02:04:27,261 --> 02:04:29,388
Keep firing! They're cIosing!

1034
02:04:49,250 --> 02:04:51,844
Come on! Fire more, more!

1035
02:05:05,399 --> 02:05:06,866
Get away from there.

1036
02:05:07,568 --> 02:05:09,798
We've stiII got one bomb aboard.

1037
02:05:10,872 --> 02:05:12,305
He's gone mad.

1038
02:05:12,874 --> 02:05:15,172
PIease taIk to them for me.

1039
02:05:15,376 --> 02:05:18,607
TeII them I did what I had to do,
what I was toId to do.

1040
02:05:31,425 --> 02:05:32,449
Where is it?

1041
02:05:32,693 --> 02:05:35,218
Look, the bomb
cannot be expIoded now.

1042
02:05:35,429 --> 02:05:38,262
I threw the arming device
into the sea. Do you understand?

1043
02:05:38,432 --> 02:05:39,456
Yes.

1044
02:05:48,509 --> 02:05:49,976
Get him! Get him!

1045
02:07:34,515 --> 02:07:36,312
I'm gIad I kiIIed him.

1046
02:07:36,517 --> 02:07:37,916
You're gIad?

1047
02:07:38,352 --> 02:07:40,752
-Who's he?
-I don't know, but he heIped me.

1048
02:07:41,856 --> 02:07:43,255
Look out, the rocks!

1049
02:07:43,858 --> 02:07:45,018
The reef!

1050
02:07:47,361 --> 02:07:49,556
He's jammed the controIs. Come on.

1051
02:07:49,730 --> 02:07:51,288
-Jump!
-I never Iearned to swim.

1052
02:07:51,465 --> 02:07:52,864
Never too Iate to Iearn.

1053
02:07:57,071 --> 02:07:58,231
Get down!
