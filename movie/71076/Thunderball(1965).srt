1
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,780
棺材上
The coffin,

2
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,990
有你名字的缩写，J.B
it has your initials, J.B.

3
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,320
那只是我们的共同点
At this moment, rather him than me.

4
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,450
至少你不必动手除掉他
At least you've been saved the effort of removing him.

5
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,180
听说布瓦上校在睡眠中过世的
Colonel Bouvar passed away in his sleep, so they tell me.

6
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,090
听你的口气，好像没亲手杀死他而很失望？
You sound disappointed you did not kill him yourself, huh?

7
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,200
没错
I am.

8
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,630
雅克・布瓦杀了我两名同仁
Jacques Bouvar murdered two of my colleagues.

9
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,600
我们法国工作站还能为邦德先生帮什么忙？
Is there anything else our French station can do for Monsieur Bond?

10
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,610
也许待会儿
Later, perhaps.

11
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,870
正如我所说，待会儿，走
As I said, later. Come on.

12
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,550
夫人
Madame.

13
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,660
我是来表示诚挚的慰问的
I've come to offer my sincere condolences.

14
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,290
我亲爱的布瓦上校
My dear Colonel Bouvar,

15
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,340
你不该自己动手开车门
I don't think you should have opened that car door by yourself.

16
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,990
那个穿着不错的老家伙也应该有一个
No well-dressed man should be without one.

17
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,900
没错，非常实际
Yes, very practical.

18
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,420
上车
Get inside.

19
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,450
- 追来了 - 快！
- They're coming. Quickly. - Hurry!

20
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:49,800
片名:霹雳弹

21
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:59,450
He always runs while others walk

22
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:09,620
He acts while other men just talk

23
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:19,930
He looks at this world, and wants it all

24
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:29,850
So he strikes, like thunderball

25
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:40,820
He knows the meaning of success

26
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:50,710
His needs are more, so he gives less

27
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:00,880
They call him the winner who takes all

28
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:10,600
And he strikes, like thunderball

29
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:21,240
Any woman he wants, he'll get

30
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:30,620
He will break any heart without regret

31
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:41,050
His days of asking are all gone

32
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:50,470
His fight goes on and on and on

33
00:06:53,190 --> 00:07:00,190
But he thinks that the fight is worth it all

34
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:09,910
So he strikes, like thunderball

35
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,320
不准停车！
Hey, no parking here!

36
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,210
抱歉，拉戈先生
Oh, pardon, Monsieur Largo.

37
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,550
国际兄弟会协助无国籍人士…
The International Brotherhood for Assistance of Stateless Persons

38
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,390
纯粹是博爱性质
is purely philanthropic.

39
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,260
我们对政治不感兴趣
We're not interested in politics,

40
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,870
只对恢复你的权利有兴趣
only in your rehabilitation.

41
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,480
我们已安排好巴西签证
We have been able to arrange for visas with the Brazilian Consulate.

42
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,810
- 谢谢，先生  - 兄弟会会照顾你们
- Thank you, Monsieur. - The Brotherhood will look after you

43
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,440
- 直到你…  - 早上好，拉戈先生
- until your... - Good morning, Mr. Largo.

44
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,530
早上好
Good morning.

45
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,070
- 很高兴你再回来  - 直到你们再一次实现自给
- Nice to have you back again. - Until you're once again self-supporting.

46
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,200
- 谢谢，宝贝  - 我们会偿还一切
- Thank you, my dear. - We pay back everything.

47
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,740
没有必要
There will be no need.

48
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,450
我们有来自私人个体的捐款
We have certain funds from private individuals

49
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,200
而且目标一致
who share our aim.

50
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,330
只需要一到两个手续
There are just one or two formalities.

51
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,220
二号，坐下
Sit down, Number Two.

52
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,460
我们等下讨论你的北约计划
We will discuss your NATO project later.

53
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,820
我很遗憾通知大家
I regret to inform you all...

54
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,080
幽灵六号的死讯

55
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,860
雅克・布瓦上校遭到不知名刺客杀害
Colonel Jacques Bouvar was killed by an unknown assassin.

56
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,030
他的成就会被记住
His services will be greatly missed.

57
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,490
现在进行各地区财务报告
We will now proceed with the area financial reports.

58
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,660
七号？
Number Seven?

59
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,800
勒索双重间谍…

60
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,770
藤原松尾
Matsou Fujiwa.

61
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,230
遗憾的是
Unfortunately,

62
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,420
只有四千万日币
only 40 million yen,

63
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,030
他只有这么多
all the man had.

64
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,670
- 十号  - 贝宁的暗杀案

the French anti-matter specialist who went over to the Russians.

66
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,580
从特别部门弄到三百万法郎…
Three million francs from the special department of the...

67
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,680
奥赛码头（法国外交部的别称）
Quai d'Orsay.

68
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,390
五号

74
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,530
由九号和我亲自去收的

75
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,660
二百三十万？
Two million three?

76
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,950
我们的估计应该要高点
Our expectations were considerably higher,

77
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,880
十一号
Number 11.

78
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,860
拉丁美洲的竞争
Competition from Latin America.

79
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,400
导致价格下跌
Prices are down.

80
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,250
我已经预测到了
I anticipated that factor.

81
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,470
你确定所有的钱都清点过吗
Are you quite sure all monies have been accounted for

82
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,970
是你本人和九号？

83
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,440
一号，每一分钱都点过
To the penny, Number One.

84
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,460
正好相反
On the contrary.

85
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,100
我自己确信你们之中有一人…
I have satisfied myself that one of you...

86
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,250
盗用公款
is clearly guilty of embezzlement.

87
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,770
幽灵党是一个专注的互助会
SPECTRE is a dedicated fraternity

88
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:27,730
其力量来自于组织成员的绝对忠诚

89
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,590
我已知道罪犯是谁

90
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,510
我决定采取适当的行动

91
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,680
现在进行新的方案
Let us now proceed with new business.

92
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,010
我们来听听二号的讲解
We will hear from Number Two,

93
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,790
他是负责北约计划的
who is in charge of our NATO project,

94
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,730
这是幽灵党有史以来最有野心的计划
the most ambitious SPECTRE has ever undertaken.

95
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,350
二号，你来报告

96
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,040
谢谢，一号
Thank you, Number One.

97
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,660
我们的目的是要求赎金…
Our intention is to demand a ransom...

98
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,210
由北大西洋公约组织支付…
from the North Atlantic Treaty powers...

99
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,860
二亿八千万美金
of $280 million.

100
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,840
即一亿英镑
100 pounds million.

101
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,230
我已指派幽灵党特工康特・里皮
I have sent SPECTRE agent Count Lippe

102
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,970
去英国南部
to the south of England,

103
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,120
在那里做必要的准备
where he is making the necessary preparations.

104
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,920
他在一家健身诊所…
He is at a health clinic

105
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,380
诊所座落在北约基地附近
conveniently located near the NATO air base.

106
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,780
派特？
Oh, Pat?

107
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,060
洗完澡，我再来找你
I'll see you when I've had a shower, huh?

108
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,140
很快就好了
I'll soon be finished.

109
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,800
邦德先生，康特・里皮
Mr. Bond. Count Lippe.

110
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,890
你不会要带她走吧？
You're not taking her away already, are you?

111
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,510
她是这乏噪无味的地方唯一的乐子
She's the only joy in this dreary place.

112
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,730
我看得出你也发现这点
I see you've discovered that, too.

113
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,980
- 派特，再半小时  - 我会马上好
- In about half an hour, Pat. - I'll be ready.

114
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,760
我听过这句话
I've heard that before.

115
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:55,090
幸会，邦德先生
Oh, nice to have met you, Mr. Bond.

116
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,550
很怪的伤口
Funny-looking bruise.

117
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,530
跌倒的吗？
A fall?

118
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,050
火钳烧伤
A poker,

119
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,670
被一个寡妇弄的
in the hands of a widow.

120
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,700
我很意外
I'm surprised.

121
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,330
我以为你很对寡妇的口味
I'd have thought you were just the type for a widow.

122
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,560
这位可不是
Oh, not this one.

123
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,420
他完全不喜欢我
He didn't like me at all.

124
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,670
红色方块，中间有个长钉穿过
A red square with a spike through it.

125
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:18,430
我认为是个秘密记号，澳门的红龙组织
Yes, I think it's a tong sign. The Red Dragon from Macao.

126
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,990
要档案科帮我查证一下
Ask Records to verify it for me, will you?

127
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,370
抱歉，宝贝，你在休假
Oh, sorry, sweetie. You're off duty.

128
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,930
你回来时，再通知你
File it till you get back.

129
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,780
莫尼彭妮，下次看到你
Moneypenny, next time I see you,

130
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,110
我会将你压在膝下
I'll put you across my knee.

131
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,030
外加果冻和柠檬汁？
On yogurt and lemon juice?

132
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,330
我等不及了！
I can hardly wait!

133
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,940
快点，派特，我们进度落后了
Come on, Pat, we're behind schedule.

134
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,340
马上来
Coming.

135
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,970
詹姆斯，你还在吗？
James, are you there?

136
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,780
我听不到你，你昏倒了吗？
I can't hear you, James. Have you fainted?

137
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,030
（里皮爵士）

138
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,920
你迟到了，邦德先生
You're late, Mr. Bond.

139
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,380
我？
Me?

140
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,130
我真认不出我自己了
Well, I'd never have recognized myself.

141
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,760
- 我还好吗？  - 可惜太健康了
- Do I seem healthy? - Too healthy, by far.

142
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:28,100
请脱掉浴袍
Take off your bathrobe, please.

143
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,960
你的口气好像不很坚持
You never say that as if you meant it.

144
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,910
手举过头
Arms above your head, please.

145
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,830
安分点，邦德先生！
Behave yourself, Mr. Bond!

146
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,120
我看只有一个地方能让你安静
Oh, I can see there's only one place to keep you quiet.

147
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,830
这是什么？
And what's this?

148
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,000
活动伸张椅，调整脊椎骨用的
A motorized traction table for stretching the spine.

149
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,600
有人称苦刑架
Some patients call it the rack.

150
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,280
这倒不意外
I'm not surprised.

151
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,760
上来吧
Oh, get on.

152
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,010
踢踏板在哪？
Where's the kick-starter?

153
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:09,060
别闹了，面向下
Oh, stop fooling around and face down, please.

154
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,110
面向下？
Face down?

155
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,680
顺便问下
By the way,

156
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,460
康特・里皮隔壁房间的人是谁？
who is the man in the room next to your Count Lippe?

157
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,850
我对他不太清楚
I really don't know too much about him.

158
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,380
安吉洛先生
A Mr. Angelo.

159
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,140
他跟私人医生一起来
He's here with a private physician,

160
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,360
疗治一场可怕车祸的伤
recuperating from an awful car crash, I understand.

161
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:28,070
第一次我一整天感觉真正安全
There now. First time I've felt really safe all day.

162
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,790
我15分钟后再来看你的情况
I'll look in and see how you're doing in 15 minutes.

163
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,060
幸会，邦德先生
Nice to have met you, Mr. Bond.

164
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,330
回来！
Hey, come back!

165
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:14,250
救命！救命！
Help! Help!

166
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,750
救命！
Help!

167
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:27,120
邦德先生！邦德先生！邦德先生！
Mr. Bond! Mr. Bond! Mr. Bond!

168
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,600
感谢老天！
Oh, thank God!

169
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,550
感谢老天！你可能会被害死！
Thank God! You could have been killed!

170
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,230
我一定高了6英寸
I must be 6 inches taller.

171
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,060
可怜的家伙！
Oh, you poor dear!

172
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,440
我想不出怎么会发生？
I can't think how it could have happened.

173
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,280
我可以告诉你，简直是奇迹，我会回来
I can tell you, it's a miracle I came back when I did.

174
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,950
我想你一定是无意间碰到了开关
I can only think that you must have pushed the switch accidentally.

175
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,200
你最好跟我来
Well, you better come along with me.

176
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,180
在蒸汽室待一下
Spend a few minutes in the steam room.

177
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,500
- 有助你放轻松  - 好
- It'll help to relax you. - Yes.

178
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,620
也许能帮你缩回去
Might even shrink you back to size.

179
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,580
有人希望今天的事没有发生
Somebody's going to wish today had never happened.

180
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,500
你不会告诉维恩医生吧？
Oh, you wouldn't tell Dr. Wain?

181
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,570
求求你，我会丢饭碗
Please. I'd lose my job.

182
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:09,510
我想我沉默总有个代价
Well, I suppose my silence could have a price.

183
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,630
你不会是指…
You don't mean...

184
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,080
不
Oh, no.

185
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,320
是
Oh, yes.

186
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,190
待会见，鳄鱼
See you later, alligator.

187
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,430
你到底在搞什么？
What the hell do you think you are doing?

188
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,640
别担心，我会告诉大厨
Now don't you worry. I'll tell the chef.

189
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,380
放我出去！
Let me out of this bloody machine!

190
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,580
救命！
Help!

191
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:07,700
救命！
Help!

192
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,510
有人在听吗？
Isn't there anybody listening?

193
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,430
（热疗中心）

194
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,380
皮草
Mink.

195
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,560
可以消除紧张
It reduces the tensions.

196
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,880
对我不管用
Not mine.

197
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,410
杜瓦尔少校的社交秘书
Major Derval's social secretary.

198
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,410
我找安吉洛先生
I would like to speak to Mr. Angelo.

199
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,560
- 什么？  - 安吉洛先生
- What's that? - Mr. Angelo.

200
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,190
抱歉，你拨错了
I'm sorry. You got the wrong number.

201
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,320
你想脱掉这个会不会舒服些…
You don't think you could be more comfortable if you take off...

202
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,910
- 什么事？ - 杜瓦尔少校？
- Yes? - Major Derval?

203
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,990
- 我就是杜瓦尔少校  - 你的车在等了

204
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,620
我马上下来，谢谢

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,670
我的车来了，任务到了，我的生活故事
My car's here. Duty calls. The story of my life.

206
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,000
你到空军基地会迟到
You'll be late at the air base.

207
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,760
此外，你会有时间冷静
And besides, it will give you time to cool off.

208
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,170
我回来时，你还在此吗？
You'll be here when I come back?

209
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,850
到时候也许就没心情了
But I may not be in the mood then.

210
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,810
- 你要打赌吗？ - 你很清楚弗朗索瓦
- Do you want to bet? - You know your Fran?ois?

211
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:22,890
我了解我自己

212
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,060

要乖，至少到我回来

216
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:39,990
再见！
Ciao!

217
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,300
- 没人看见我们，走道没人 - 门关上！
- Nobody saw us. The corridor is empty. - Shut that door!

218
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,060
他死了
He's dead all right.

219
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,400
里皮，你掩护

伽马毒气，浓缩式

225
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,200
你刚用的那种
Type you just used.

226
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,940
而最重要的…
And most important...

227
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,050
不够
Not enough.

228
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,040
十万元不够
$100,000 is not enough.

229
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,650
你想说什么？
What are you trying to say?

230
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,220
我改变主意
I changed my mind.

231
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,740
我花了二年
Two years of my life,

232
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,980
研究影片
studying the film,

233
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,210

算是二十五万好了
Make it a quarter of a million...

237
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,010
要不你找别人
or get someone else.

238
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,720
没有别人！
There is no one else!

239
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,930
没错
Exactly.

收起来
Put that away.

00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,440
安吉洛说得没错
Angelo is right.

243
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:59,360
我会通知一号，我们已重新安排过
I'll inform Number One we made a new arrangement.

244
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:02,370
这只是定金而已
This is merely a down payment.

245
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,840
好，但我要二十五万
All right, but against quarter of a million.

246
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,890
同意
Agreed.

247
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:09,250
他的表，身分辨明卡

248
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,420
- 再见！ - 不，他总说再会

- 再见！ - 还有帽子
- Ciao! - And the cap,

250
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,140
它戴得太后面了

剩下的钱准备好就好

来，帮他换上睡袍

253
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,160
长官，麻烦证件
Sir? Identity, please, sir.

254
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,880
谢谢
Thank you, sir.

255
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:01,050
这是单机出击例行训练
This is a normal training sortie,

256
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,890

and you'll be flying a Vulcan at an altitude of 45,000 feet,

261
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:16,360
携带二枚核弹，MOS型

262
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,400
雷管一样，在白色安全盒里

263
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,890
那些可恶的飞机

264
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,580
够让你发疯的
They're enough to drive you mad.

265
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,440
除非
Unless,

266
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:59,500
是你那个皮草手套
of course, it's that mink glove of yours.

267

270
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,620
哪儿都不去
Nowhere.

271
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,070
我只想运动一下
I thought I'd take a little exercise.

272
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,290
你开什么玩笑！
You must be joking!

273
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,360
来！

00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,620
发生什么了？怎么回事？
What's happening? What's going on?

280
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:02,420
不知道，是大门口电铃吗？
I don't know. Could it be the front doorbell?

281
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,780
不，绝对不是
No, it most certainly could not.

282

那好吧
Oh, hello.

00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:09,470
你晚上运动得还不够吗？
Haven't you had enough exercise for one evening?

284
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:12,090
你会这么说真奇怪

00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,610
也许是这个
Perhaps this, sir.

422
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:31,530
有一张这个人的照片在档案夹里
Well, there was a photograph of that man in this dossier you gave us.

423
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:33,130
他名叫杜瓦尔
His name is Derval.

424
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,440
我昨晚在灌木丛看到他
Well, I saw him last night at Shrublands,

425
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,080
但他已经死了
but he was dead.

426
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,760
不，不可能
Oh, no, sir, not possible.

427
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:41,260
他还登上瓦肯号，昨晚起飞
He was seen boarding the Vulcan. Took off last night.

428
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:44,890
如果007说他昨晚看见杜瓦尔死了
If 007 says he saw Derval last night at Shrublands and he was dead,

429
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,390
我就不会再质问
that's enough for me to initiate inquiries.

430
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,580
当然
Oh, well. Yes, sir. Of course.

431
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:51,940
这女孩是谁？
Who is this girl?

432
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,760
杜瓦尔的妹妹
Derval's sister, sir.

433
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:56,680
知道她现在在哪吗？
Do you know where she is now?

434
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,950
拿索
Nassau.

435
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,760
你认为有必要调查她吗？
Do you think she's worth going after?

436
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:04,330
我不会错过
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, sir.

437
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,940
只有四天，007
You've only got four days, 007.

438
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:08,150
别把时间浪费在这里
Don't spend your time sitting around.

439
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:09,930
我不会，长官
No, sir, I won't.

440
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:13,300
祝你好运
Good luck.

441
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,430
长官，谢谢
Thank you, sir.

442
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,200
身材真好！
Smashing figure!

443
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,700
我想这和你请求毫无关系
I don't suppose that has anything to do with your request.

444
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:23,670
我是天生被人误会的人？
Was there ever a man more misunderstood?

445
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,830
詹姆斯，你骗不过我的双眼
Now, James, you can't pull the wool over my eyes.

446
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,660
你也许能骗老头子
You may be able to con the old man,

447
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:28,970
但我很清楚
but I know better.

448
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:29,970
我能…
I could...

449
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:33,220
我也一样，莫尼彭妮小姐
So do I, Miss Moneypenny.

450
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,440
我会感谢你别称呼我…
And I'll thank you not to refer to me...

451
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,140
“老头子”
as "the old man."

452
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,810
我想我进来时有顶帽子
I think I had a hat when I came in.

453
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:48,160
詹姆斯？
James?

454
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:51,230
你怎么认出她的？
How else will you recognize her?

455
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,440
绝对错不了
Couldn't miss.

456
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:54,610
她左大腿上有二个胎记
She has two moles on the left thigh.

457
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:02,050
- 谢谢你… - 詹姆斯・邦德
- Thank you, Mr... - James Bond.

458
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:04,040
我在你下水后就来了
I arrived soon after you went down.

459
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,830
我很欣赏你的姿态
I've been admiring your form.

460
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:06,780
是吗？
Have you, now?

461
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,170
你叫詹姆斯・邦德
Your name's James Bond

462
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,770
而很欣赏我的姿态吗？
and you've been admiring my form?

463
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,040
大部分的女孩只是在玩水
Most girls just paddle around.

464
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:15,030
- 你游得跟男人一样 - 你也是
- You swim like a man. - So do you.

465
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:16,850
我常常练习
Well, I've had quite a bit of practice.

466
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,500
你常来吗？
Do you come here often?

467
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:19,900
无聊的时候就来
Whenever I'm bored.

468
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,990
事实上每天都来
Practically every day.

469
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:23,830
你还做些什么？在哪做？
What else do you do, and where?

470
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:27,500
- 你从不浪费时间，是吗？ - 是的
- You don't waste time, do you? - No.

471
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,830
- 当纪念 - 谢谢
- For effort. - Oh, thank you.

472
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,420
我会穿戴起来，下次你就认得出我
I'll wear it, so you'll know me next time.

473
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:34,230
我说得没错，绝对错不了
I was right. Couldn't miss.

474
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:37,050
- 我不明白 - 很快就会明白了
- I'm not with you. - Oh, you soon will be.

475
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,550
- 保拉！拉我一把，好吗？ - 上来吧
- Paula! Give me a hand, will you? - Get in.

476
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,890
通知伦敦我联络上那个女孩
Tell London I've made contact with the girl.

477
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,900
我不认为那是“联络”
Well, it's not what I'd call contact,

478
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:55,020
我会说你看见她
but I'll pass it through you've seen the girl.

479
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:59,360
- 继续加油  - 发动不了！
- Keep trying. - It won't start!

480
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:09,460
我们马达坏了！
Ahoy there! Our motor's conked out.

481
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,710
你不会要去珊瑚港附近吧？
You wouldn't be going anywhere near Coral Harbor, would you?

482
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:13,380
我本来不去，但可以绕一下
I wasn't, but I could.

483
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:15,520
我有个很重要的约会
Well, I've a very important appointment there,

484
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:17,190
很感激你送我一程
and I'd very much appreciate a lift.

485
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,460
上来吧！
Come aboard, then.

486
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:21,260
你不介意搭别的船吧？
You don't mind taking the service boat, do you?

487
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:22,490
不会
Not at all.

488
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:23,990
快！
Hurry up!

489
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:05,650
也许我们还能在泳池边午餐
Perhaps you could lunch by the pool.

490
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,770
你的紧急约会呢？
How about your urgent appointment?

491
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,800
你来这里多久？
How long have you been out here?

492
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:28,330
约三周
About three weeks.

493
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:31,270
你一直都这么多问题吗？
Don't you ever stop asking questions?

494
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,340
好，改变战略
All right. Change of tack.

495
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:35,960
喝点我的海鲜汤
Have some of my conch chowder.

496
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,250
你搞错了，邦德先生
You've been reading the wrong books, Mr. Bond.

497
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:41,210
- 海鲜汤吗？ - 当一名调情圣手
- About conch chowder? - Being an aphrodisiac.

498
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:44,470
我正好喜欢海鲜汤
Well, it just so happens that I like conch chowder.

499
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:50,260
你的朋友？
Friend of yours?

500
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:52,240
为我监护人工作
Works for my guardian.

501
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,860
你的监护人监视你？
Your guardian has you watched?

502
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:56,920
他喜欢知道我在哪
He likes to know where I am.

503
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,650
我不怪他
I don't blame him.

504
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:08,820
- 恕我失陪 - 你不会这么快就走吧？
- Will you excuse me? - You're not going so soon?

505
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:10,040
恐怕是如此
I'm afraid so.

506
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:11,760
我监护人的游艇
My guardian's yacht.

507
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,310
真的？
Oh, really?

508
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:15,620
他在等我
He'll be expecting me.

509
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:18,210
我能和你去吗？想见见你的监护人
May I come with you? I'd love to meet your guardian.

510
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:19,880
不行！
Oh, no!

511
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,670
- 能再见到你吗？ - 这岛很小
- Will I see you again? - It's a small island.

512
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,340
- 也许能一起吃晚餐 - 不行
- Perhaps we can have dinner together. - No.

513
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,160
真不合作的多米诺…
My dear, uncooperative Domino...

514
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,770
你怎么知道？
How do you know that?

515
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:32,180
你怎么知道我朋友叫我多米诺？
How do you know my friends call me Domino?

516
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:34,190
你脚踝的链子上写的
It's on the bracelet on your ankle.

517
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,830
你眼睛真利
So, what sharp little eyes you've got!

518
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:40,690
等你尝到我的厉害之后
Wait till you get to my teeth.

519
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:50,700
- 明天见  - 再见
- Bye, then. - Bye.

520
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:53,330
- 明天在海滩上见  - 明天再见
- See you tomorrow on the beach. - See you guys soon.

521
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,530
- 五百英镑 - 好的，先生
500 pounds, please.

522
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,160
谢谢
Thanks.

523
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:34,160
抱歉
Sorry.

524
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:37,370
- 拿去 - 谢谢
- There. - Thank you.

525
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:49,430
二百
Two hundred.

526
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,490
八点
Eight.

527
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,530
总要有人输
Someone has to lose.

528
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,620
对，我以为你肩后有幽灵
Yes, I thought I saw a specter at your shoulder.

529
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,180
什么意思？
What do you mean?

530
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,560
失败的魔鬼
The specter of defeat.

531
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,170
你要改运了
That your luck was due to change.

532
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,680
我们很快就会知道
We'll soon find out.

533
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:27,960
提高赌注有异议吗？五百英镑？
Any objection to raise the limit? 500 pounds, should we say?

534
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:29,970
- 太大了 - 我也退出
- Too big for me. - Count me out, too.

535
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:31,770
也许你想接手
Perhaps you'd like to take the shoe.

536
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:34,410
我朋友不会介意，您是…
My friend won't mind, Mr...

537
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:35,830
- 邦德 - 是的
- Bond. - Oh, yes.

538
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:37,040
邦德先生
Mr. Bond.

539
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:40,020
我有位同事提过你
One of my associates spoke about you.

540
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:42,000
希望不是坏话
Nothing bad, I hope.

541
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,820
是你的幽灵跟我的对抗
It's your specter against mine, huh?

542
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:50,780
你希望我走厄运？
You wish to put the evil eye on me, huh?

543
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:53,610
我来的地方有种对付的方法
We have a way to deal with that where I come from.

544
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:54,670
你也许会骗到我
Well, you may hex me.

545
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,360
看看对牌如何
Let's see what it does for the cards.

546
00:50:57,870 --> 00:50:59,080
- 不要了 - 不要
- No. - No.

547
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,080
- 七点  - 六点
- Seven. - Six.

548
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:21,490
八点
Eight.

549
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:23,270
九点
Nine.

550
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:28,060
你好像打不败，邦德先生
You seem to be unbeatable, Mr. Bond.

551
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:30,690
目前而已，这种事维持不久
For the moment. This sort of thing can't last.

552
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,640
埃米利奥，你答应请我一杯酒
Emilio, you promised to buy me a drink.

553
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:33,900
亲爱的，马上
Soon, my dear.

554
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:35,340
我要先赢回来
I want to get my money back first.

555
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:37,590
能容我请小姐一杯酒吗？
May I be allowed to buy the lady a drink?

556
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:40,840
我会很感激
I would appreciate that. Thank you.

557
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:43,020
那我必须换手了
Then I must pass the shoe.

558
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,550
如果他不改手气，他会变得很无理
He's going to be impossible if his luck doesn't change.

559
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:52,300
我想今晚是不会变了
Somehow I don't think it will tonight.

560
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:56,470
鱼子酱，唐・培里侬香槟王，55年份的（法国名贵香槟酒）
Beluga caviar, Dom Perignon '55.

561
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:58,350
- 先生 - 谢谢
- Monsieur. - Thank you.

562
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:02,060
我知道你是拉戈先生的侄女
I understand you're Mr. Largo's niece.

563
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:04,080
比什么要好听一些…
It sounds better than...

564
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,310
你是怎么说的？情妇？
What would you say? Mistress?

565
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:08,540
- 妓女？  - 我不会这么说
- Kept woman? - I wouldn't say that.

566
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:11,070
- 你在哪儿认识他的？  - 在卡普里
- Where did you meet him? - In Capri.

567
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:13,860
我跟我哥弗朗索瓦在那里
I was there with my brother, Fran?ois.

568
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:15,970
奇怪
Strange.

569
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:18,150
我发现埃米利奥很有魅力
I found Emilio attractive...

570
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,700
那之后
Then.

571
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,910
他住在船上吗？
Does he live aboard the yacht?

572
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:23,890
不，在岛上有房子
No. He has a house on the island.

573
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,080
- 一定要谈他吗？  - 不是
- Must we talk about him? - No.

574
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:28,710
- 我情愿跳舞 - 我也是
- I'd much rather dance. - So would I.

575
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:38,390
- 你哥现在在哪儿？ - 英国
- Where is your brother now? - In England.

576
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:41,310
他是北约空军少校
He's a commandant with the NATO forces there.

577
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:43,890
他人很棒
He's a wonderful person.

578
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:46,850
我却一直遇不到他那种人
The trouble is, I never meet anyone like him.

579
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:49,230
只遇上拉戈和我这种人
Only men like Largo and myself.

580
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,690
- 你不像拉戈  - 不像吗？
- You are not like Largo. - No?

581
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,110
你为何这么说？
Why do you say that?

582
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:00,570
你抱我的方式
The way you hold me.

583
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:05,830
那边！
There.

584
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,500
你在拿索待多久？
How long you staying on here in Nassau?

585
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:16,170
我们准备在后天离开
We are going the day after tomorrow.

586
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:19,160
我说过，我们时间不多
As I said, we haven't got very much time.

587
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:21,570
埃米利奥想要离开
Emilio wants to leave.

588
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:28,350
你今晚睡在船上吗？
Are you sleeping aboard tonight?

589
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:32,480
我希望你别这么露骨
I hoped you'd not be so obvious.

590
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:35,150
当一个人时间不多，行动必须露骨
Well, when one has little time, one sort of has to be obvious.

591
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:38,320
- 你知道哪儿能找到我 - 邦德先生
- You know where you can find me. - Mr. Bond.

592
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,610
你侄女是位好舞者
Your niece is an excellent dancer.

593
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:44,030
让我向你证明我是名好输家，邦德先生
Let me prove I'm as good a loser as you are a winner, Mr. Bond.

594
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,290
周日来吃中饭，我在帕米拉的家
Come to lunch on Sunday at Palmyra. It's my house here.

595
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:48,800
那就决定在周日中午
Sunday at noon, then.

596
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:50,500
亲爱的
My dear.

597
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,650
- 晚安 - 晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

598
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:56,300
你得逐字告诉我邦德说的话
You must tell me what Mr. Bond had to say, word for word.

599
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:58,010
他谈起一些你的事
He talked about you a little.

600
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:00,180
他刚刚说了什么？我没听清楚
What was he saying just then? I didn't quite hear.

601
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:02,510
他问今晚我们是否睡在船上
He asked, "Were we sleeping aboard tonight?"

602
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:04,010
有趣
Interesting.

603
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:24,160
- 我的钥匙，304房 - 304房，谢谢
- My key. It's 304, please. - Thank you. 304.

604
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,370
- 抱歉，没有信 - 谢谢
- I'm sorry. No mail. - Thank you.

605
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,480
保拉？
Paula?

606
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:03,380
保拉？
Paula?

607
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:34,410
你好，00…
Well, hello, 00...

608
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:03,440
这样对待中情局真不赖！
Fine way to treat the CIA!

609
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:04,600
抱歉，菲利克斯
Sorry about that, Felix,

610
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,850
但你正要说007
but you were just about to say 007.

611
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,320
拿着
Here.

612
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,070
詹姆斯？你杀了他没？
Well, James? Have you killed him?

613
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,890
你应该最了解我
You know me better than that.

614
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,950
去吧，笑面虎
There you go, smiler.

615
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:20,210
看到你到此想看的吗？
Have you seen everything you came to see?

616
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:21,960
回你朋友那里去报告
Go back to your friends and report.

617
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:25,380
告诉他，小鱼我丢回海里
Tell them the little fish I throw back into the sea.

618
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:26,300
给他
Give it to him.

619
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,660
你要从我背后开枪
You're going to shoot me in the back?

620
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:30,800
我是指枪
The gun, I mean.

621
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,850
快走！
Now move!

622
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:39,520
- 他是谁？ - 就如我说，小鱼…
- Who was he? - Like I said, a small fish.

623
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,650
替拉戈先生工作
Working for a Mr. Largo.

624
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:44,110
他有艘游艇，我们待会儿该去看看
He's got a yacht we should take a look at later.

625
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:51,620
- 奎斯特要见拉戈先生 - 让他进去！
- Quist, to see Mr. Largo. - Open up!

626
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:01,740
（帕米拉，私人处所，非请莫入）

627
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,010
什么事？是奎斯特！
Yes? It's Quist!

628
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:12,640
轻松点，朋友
Gently, my friend, gently.

629
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,850
- 你查到什么？ - 什么也没有
- What did you find? - Nothing.

630
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:18,600
- 你见到邦德了？ - 见到了
- You saw Bond? - Yes, I saw him.

631
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,190
出了什么事？
What happened?

632
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:27,190
你让他制服了你
You let him get the better of you.

633
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:30,610
不！
No!

634
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:34,270
不！不！
No! No!

635
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:35,600
不！
No!

636
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,330
不！
No!

637
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:55,530
嗨，你好！
Hey there!

638
00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:57,010
你终于联络上了吗？
Did you finally make contact?

639
00:58:57,050 --> 00:58:57,950
你迟到了
You're late.

640
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:58,900
菲利克斯・莱特
Felix Leiter,

641
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:01,140
- 这位是平德，我们在此的伙伴  - 幸会
- this is Pinder, our man here. - How do you do?

642
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:02,980
各位，这边请
This way, gentlemen.

643
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:04,240
那女孩是谁，詹姆斯？
Who's the girl, James?

644
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,240
保拉・卡普兰，我这儿的助手
Paula Caplan, my assistant here.

645
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:14,950
他没有造访美国的计划
We have no plans to visit the United States.

646
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:16,470
特别报导…
Now here is a special announcement...

647
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,880
来自BBC外电
from the Overseas Service of the BBC.

648
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:23,830
今晚六点时大本钟确实敲了七下
Big Ben actually did strike seven times at 6:00 this evening.

649
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,580
这是机械故障造成的
This was caused by a mechanical failure,

650
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:29,550
上一次出现还是1895年的那次雷暴天气
which last occurred during a violent electrical storm in 1898.

651
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:32,670
让我们再度回到头条新闻
Here once again are the headlines...

652
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,930
显然是在拖延时间
Obviously stalling for time.

653
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:39,720
- 不！ - 007
- Oh, no. - 007.

654
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:43,060
- 真棒的惊喜 - 我也一样
- What a wonderful surprise. - Well, for me, too.

655
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:46,100
我得说，我觉得这些你用来逃命的武器…
I must say, I find this business of equipping you in the field,

656
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:49,270
他们是… 非常的不寻常
on the run, as it were, highly irregular.

657
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:53,430
这是盖革计数器
Here we have a Geiger counter,

658
00:59:54,010 --> 00:59:55,560
实用而不易损坏
useful and unobtrusive.

659
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:58,030
这个短针会计算辐射能量
The sweep hand takes the radioactivity count.

660
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:00,990
- 当然也是防水的 - 当然
- It's waterproof, of course. - But of course.

661
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,790
我要你特别小心这个
Now here's something I want you to use with special care.

662
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:09,000
特别小心
With special care.

663
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:11,170
- 你所给我的一切…  - 我全都很小心使用
- Everything you give me... - Is treated with equal contempt.

664
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:13,840
我知道，但这是一具水底相机
Yes, I know. But that's an underwater camera.

665
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:17,500
按这个钮就能连续拍八张照片
It takes eight pictures in rapid succession by pressing that button there.

666
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:19,230
这个设计很特别吗？
Is that clever?

667
01:00:19,290 --> 01:00:20,810
如果你可以在黑暗中…
Well, if it can take pictures in the dark

668
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:22,970
用红外线底片拍照，那就很特别
with an infrared film, yes.

669
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:30,070
试着别像往常滥用，007
Try to be a little less than your usual frivolous self, 007.

670
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:32,400
这是迷你信号弹
Now here's a miniature Very pistol,

671
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,060
它能发射很亮的红色信号
which fires a bright red flare, a distress signal.

672
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,790
你该全天候随身携带
You should keep it on you day and night.

673
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,390
我不喜欢你最后说的那句话
I resent that remark.

674
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:44,710
你介意吗？
Here! Look, do you mind?

675
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:48,580
当你在水下无法呼吸时…
Now, in the event of a rebreather not being available,

676
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:50,130
你可以使用这个装置
you can use this device.

677
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:51,690
当然只是短时间
For short periods only, of course.

678
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:53,640
大约四分钟
Say about four minutes.

679
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:54,900
聪明
Clever.

680
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:57,520
不到最后关头别用
Obviously you'll only use it as a last resort.

681
01:00:57,830 --> 01:01:00,490
很适合放在口袋里
It closes to a convenient pocket size.

682
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:04,060
假设有这样的口袋
That's assuming one has a convenient pocket.

683
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:05,100
注意
Now pay attention.

684
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:08,300
最近发明的无害无线电装置
A recently developed harmless radioactive device...

685
01:01:08,730 --> 01:01:09,780
无害的？
Harmless?

686
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,530
自动发射至特殊接收器
...which sends out a homing signal to a special receiver.

687
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:17,070
我该如何使用？
And what am I supposed to do with this?

688
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,740
很显然，你得…
Obviously, you...

689
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:20,870
吞下去
swallow it.

690
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:22,340
现在？
Now?

691
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,620
希望她今晚还会停留在原地
Let's hope she'll still be lying in the same place tonight.

692
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:32,850
稍后我们可以用这双体船当作聚会的地方
We'll use this catamaran as a rendezvous place for later.

693
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:35,800
- 好主意  - 带她进来
- Good idea. - Take her in.

694
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:41,260
有一个容器将会被投至缅甸海岸…
A container will be dropped off the coast of Burma...

695
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:43,720
在丹老群岛附近
in the Mergui Archipelago,

696
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:46,330
北纬20度
latitude 20 degrees north,

697
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:49,160
东经60度
longitude 60 degrees east,

698
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:52,730
时间是在五月二十七日，格林威治时间下午八点
at 20:00 hours Greenwich Mean Time on May 27th.

699
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:57,880
里面有完美的蓝白钻石
It will hold blue-white flawless diamonds...

700
01:01:58,290 --> 01:01:59,700
重3到8克拉不等
between three and eight karats.

701
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:04,660
总价值不准低于现在市价的一百亿英镑
Total value to be not less than 100 pounds million, present market price.

702
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,470
在我们收取容器…
After we have recovered the container...

703
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:10,320
确认无误后
and verified its contents,

704
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:15,460
将以无线电频率16.23兆赫通知你们…
you will be notified on radio frequency 16.23 megacycles...

705
01:02:15,550 --> 01:02:18,220
何处可以找到核弹
where the atomic bombs may be recovered.

706
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,680
肯纳生，立刻去准备
Kenniston, you better get on to De Beers at once.

707
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,350
是
Yes, sir.

708
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:24,450
各位
Well, gentlemen,

709
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:27,470
除非那些炸弹被找到
unless those bombs are found,

710
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,810
我恐怕我们得付款
I'm very much afraid we'll have to pay their price.

711
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:30,700
长官
Sir.

712
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:32,770
噢，对了
Oh, yes.

713
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:34,700
007在拿索传来的电报
Signal from 007 in Nassau.

714
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,500
有一、二件事会引起我们的兴趣
One or two things that might interest us.

715
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,240
迪斯科-沃兰特号仍在港口，停泊在赌场航线
The Disco Volante is still in the harbor, lying off the Casino Channel.

716
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,700
双船身的船也在，能利用它当掩护
The catamaran is there, too, so we can use her for cover.

717
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:45,910
很好，你们可以在船后放我下水
Oh, that's fine. You can drop me in the water behind her.

718
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:47,870
- 伦敦有进一步的消息吗？ - 没有
- Any further news from London? - No.

719
01:02:47,950 --> 01:02:50,910
仍是27日晚上八点
Zero hour is still 2000 hours on the 27th.

720
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,250
- 现在只剩55小时 - 我们走吧
- That's just 55 hours from now. - Yes. Shall we go?

721
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:01,680
- 这里可以了 - 我们在潘德那儿见
- Okay, this will do here. - Okay, we'll meet back at Pinder's.

722
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,090
祝你好运
Good luck.

723
01:03:57,270 --> 01:03:58,730
打开水下灯
Turn the underwater lights on.

724
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:08,410
打开闭路电视！
TV closed circuit!

725
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:31,640
手榴弹
Hand grenades.

726
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:34,940
准备好了！
Ready!

727
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,780
这下面
Down there.

728
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:00,750
那边！
There!

729
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:08,760
快点！发射！
Quick! Launch!

730
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,300
那边有东西！
There's something there!

731
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:53,140
是他！掉头！
That's him! Turn around!

732
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:03,480
稳住
Hold that.

733
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:06,690
推进器一定撞到他了
Look! We must have hit him with the propeller.

734
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:08,990
让我们回去告诉拉戈
Let's get back and tell Largo.

735
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:50,360
- 能载我一程吗？ - 当然
- Can I have a lift? - Sure.

736
01:06:50,450 --> 01:06:51,490
谢谢
Thank you.

737
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:53,450
你救了我一命
You've just about saved my life.

738
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:54,340
真的吗？
Really?

739
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:57,370
我的船翻了，我得游上岸
My outboard capsized, so I had to swim ashore.

740
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:00,540
你要到哪儿？
How far do you go?

741
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:05,670
最好系上安全带
You better fasten your safety belt.

742
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:09,420
你叫什么名字？
What's your name?

743
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:10,970
詹姆斯・邦德
James Bond.

744
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,300
菲奥娜・沃尔佩
Fiona Volpe.

745
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:33,930
你常来这儿吗？
You fly here often?

746
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,720
我让你紧张吗？
Do I make you nervous?

747
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:38,300
不，我只是不想…
No. It's just that I have no desire to be...

748
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:40,390
一晚被困住二次
capsized twice in one night.

749
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:43,500
至少你不必游上岸
Well, at least you won't have to swim ashore.

750
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:51,010
邦德先生，你以前来过这吗？
Have you been here before, Mr. Bond?

751
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:52,380
不，我没有
No, I haven't.

752
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:54,760
但这是往拿索的路吧？
But this is the road to Nassau?

753
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:58,220
是的，总会到的
Yes. Eventually.

754
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:23,490
我就到这儿
Well, this is as far as I go.

755
01:08:23,550 --> 01:08:25,560
我也是，这是我的旅社
Yes, me, too. This is my hotel.

756
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:28,380
- 真巧 - 是，真方便
- What a coincidence! - Yes. So convenient.

757
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:33,970
你脸色很苍白，希望我没吓到你
You look pale, Mr. Bond. I hope I didn't frighten you.

758
01:08:34,050 --> 01:08:36,050
我一向是位紧张的乘客
No, actually, I've always been a nervous passenger.

759
01:08:36,130 --> 01:08:37,800
有些男人不喜欢被载
Some men just don't like to be driven.

760
01:08:37,890 --> 01:08:41,180
不，有些男人只是不想被载着兜风
No, some men just don't like to be taken for a ride.

761
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:54,070
看这个，水下舱门
Look at this. An underwater hatch.

762
01:08:55,150 --> 01:08:58,030
原来他们这样进出
Yeah. So, that's how they could leave and get back.

763
01:08:58,110 --> 01:08:59,620
对，又没人看见
Yes. And nobody saw them.

764
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:02,330
很显然，整个行动都在水下进行
Obviously, the whole operation was carried out underwater.

765
01:09:02,410 --> 01:09:05,370
所以那是我们要找飞机的地方，走
So, that's where we'll have to look for the plane. Come on, Felix.

766
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:06,830
等照片干了之后，我会送到旅社
I'll bring the prints to the hotel when they're dry.

767
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:18,590
别忘了，空军已经搜索了拿索周围250哩内
Yes, the Air Force searched the area 250 miles out of Nassau.

768
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,970
一定在范围外
This one must be beyond that radius.

769
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:23,470
那就是迪斯科-沃兰特号，那晚停的地方
Yeah, that's if the Disco Volante was out that night.

770
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,500
当然
Yeah, sure she was.

771
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:27,020
但海港管制员说她只出去了六小时
But Harbor Control said only for six hours.

772
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:32,320
六小时内她不可能航行五百哩
She couldn't cover 500 miles in that time, no.

773
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:35,430
在六小时内她顶多九十哩路程
About 90 miles is her limit for six hours,

774
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:37,060
而且是来回的
and that's out and back.

775
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:43,210
我建议我们往远一点走
I reckon we've got to go further out,

776
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:45,560
那我们就需要加油了
and we'll need more gas for that.

777
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:48,210
好，我们回拿索，时间不多了
All right, let's get back to Nassau. We haven't got much time.

778
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:50,580
没错，时间是不多了
You're right, James, we haven't.

779
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,690
放！
Pull!

780
01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:13,910
他们当然在监视我们，宝贝
Of course they are watching us, my dear.

781
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:15,860
不然他们还能干嘛？
What else have they to do?

782
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:20,010
你希望邦德死掉吗？
You would like Bond dead.

783
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:22,190
想不出更好的安排
I can think of no better arrangement.

784
01:10:22,570 --> 01:10:25,830
因为他想和你女人做爱？
Because he tries to make love to your woman?

785
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:27,230
因为他是邦德
Because he is Bond,

786
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:29,850
幽灵党的敌人应该被除掉
and as an enemy of SPECTRE, should be killed.

787
01:10:29,910 --> 01:10:31,000
放！
Mark!

788
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:35,500
如果你昨晚的轻率造成邦德死亡的话
If Bond had died last night as a result of your hastiness,

789
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:39,080
他的政府就会发现炸弹在这儿
his government would have known for certain the bombs are here.

790
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:41,750
时机成熟时，他会被杀
When the time is right, he will be killed.

791
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:42,950
放！
Pull!

792
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:46,930
我会杀了他
I shall kill him.

793
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,700
单独的池子
A separate pool.

794
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:54,270
一定是为了养鲨鱼
For sharks, no less.

795
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:55,500
靠近点
Move in.

796
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:58,650
保持航向
Hold on that line.

797
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:05,280
那儿的确是拉戈的地方，我下个拜访的地点
That's Largo's place, all right. My next port of call.

798
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:27,310
- 拉戈先生？ - 是的
- Mr. Largo? - Yes, sir.

799
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:28,470
谢谢
Thank you.

800
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:46,990
我能帮忙吗？
Can I help?

801
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,490
当然能，邦德先生，当然可以
Why, Mr. Bond. Of course you can.

802
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:52,000
这听起来特别令人动心
That looks particularly inviting.

803
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,960
邦德先生，欢迎到帕米拉
Mr. Bond. Welcome to Palmyra.

804
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:56,190
我的荣幸
Oh, it's a pleasure.

805
01:11:56,290 --> 01:11:58,690
只希望没有打扰到什么
I just hope I'm not interrupting anything.

806
01:11:58,750 --> 01:11:59,750
什么意思？
What do you mean?

807
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,840
我以为你有别的访客
I thought perhaps you'd another visitor.

808
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:04,010
不
No.

809
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:08,100
这把枪好像较适合女孩子
That gun. Looks more fitting for a woman.

810
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,890
你对枪很有研究？
Do you know much about guns, Mr. Bond?

811
01:12:10,970 --> 01:12:13,310
不，我懂点女人
No. I know a little about women.

812
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:16,980
詹尼先生，瓦格斯先生
Mr. Janni, Mr. Vargas.

813
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:18,650
瓦格斯先生，詹尼先生
Mr. Vargas, Mr. Janni.

814
01:12:18,730 --> 01:12:20,320
哪一位是哪一位？
Oh, which is which?

815
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,030
我想你应该见过…
I thought you might have met...

816
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,240
瓦格斯先生，在那天晚上
Mr. Vargas the other night.

817
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:28,410
- 是的 - 喝酒吗？
- Oh, yes. I believe I did. - Drinks, sir.

818
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:30,430
兰姆可林酒好吗？
Rum Collins, Mr. Bond?

819
01:12:30,570 --> 01:12:31,410
好
Yes.

820
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:32,850
时间正好，对吧？
Just about that hour, isn't it?

821
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:35,540
给你的？
For you?

822
01:12:36,430 --> 01:12:37,350
当然！
Of course!

823
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:40,110
瓦格斯不喝酒，不抽烟
Vargas does not drink. Does not smoke.

824
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:42,760
不做爱
Does not make love.

825
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:45,550
你会做什么，瓦格斯？
What do you do, Vargas?

826
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:48,590
每个人都有自己的喜好
Every man has his passion.

827
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,370
我喜欢钓鱼
Mine is fishing.

828
01:12:51,890 --> 01:12:53,890
你呢，邦德先生？
What is yours, Mr. Bond?

829
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:57,400
我不是你所谓有喜好的人
Well, I'm not what you'd call a passionate man.

830
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:06,610
我该换件衣服了
I think it's time I went to change.

831
01:13:08,030 --> 01:13:10,370
让我带你参观一下
You must let me show you around.

832
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:12,200
很乐意
Oh, I'd love that.

833
01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:14,080
我想你会喜欢的
I thought you might.

834
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:15,960
放！
Pull!

835
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:18,120
还有什么比这更容易的？
What could be easier?

836
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:21,340
- 也许你能帮我放一个  - 当然，放！
- Perhaps you'd call one for me. - Of course. Pull!

837
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:23,460
看来十分困难
Seems terribly difficult.

838
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:28,590
- 并不难，对吧？  - 不难
- No, it isn't, is it? - No.

839
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:37,560
我为不同的海洋水族馆收集大型凶暴鱼类
I collect big game fish for various marine institutions.

840
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:40,270
十分出色的动物！
Magnificent creatures.

841
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,520
非常迷人
Charming.

842
01:13:42,610 --> 01:13:44,350
恶名昭彰的黄金鲨
The notorious Golden Grotto sharks.

843
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:47,010
最野蛮，最危险
The most savage, the most dangerous.

844
01:13:47,450 --> 01:13:50,360
它们知道喂食的时间到了
They know when it's time for them to be fed.

845
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:52,610
那船是你的吗？
That boat, is she yours?

846
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:53,780
“迪斯科-沃兰特”？是的
The Disco Volante? Yes.

847
01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:54,890
我以它为荣
I'm very proud of her.

848
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:57,210
跑多快？15节？
What does she do? About 15 knots?

849
01:13:57,290 --> 01:13:59,460
比那要好，接近20节
Better than that. Near 20.

850
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:03,000
也许你想去看看
Perhaps you'd like to see over her.

851
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:04,210
是，很想看
Yes, I would, very much.

852
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:07,300
- 埃米利奥，午餐好了 - 亲爱的，谢谢
- Emilio, lunch is ready. - Thank you, my darling.

853
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:08,510
来吧，邦德先生
Come along, Mr. Bond.

854
01:14:08,590 --> 01:14:10,140
海鲜汤很香
The conch chowder smells delicious.

855
01:14:10,230 --> 01:14:12,170
多米诺，我想过了
Domino, I was just thinking,

856
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,120
既然我今晚没空
as I'll be busy this evening,

857
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:17,600
也许邦德先生会足够好心带你去参加欢节庆
perhaps Mr. Bond will be kind enough to take you to the Junkanoo.

858
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,420
本地的嘉年华会
It's our local Mardi Gras.

859
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:21,540
你是我今晚的贵宾，邦德先生
You'll be my guest tonight, Mr. Bond.

860
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,770
- 非常谢谢你 - 是我的荣幸
- Well, that's very kind of you. - It will be my pleasure.

861
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:31,570
你好！
Oh, hello!

862
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:33,740
你好！
Oh, hello.

863
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:36,580
邦德先生一定自视很高
Our Mr. Bond must have a high opinion of himself.

864
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:37,910
自视很高？
Opinion?

865
01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:40,790
是的 他也和我约了
Yes. He has a date with me, too.

866
01:14:45,090 --> 01:14:46,420
失陪一下
Excuse me.

867
01:15:02,350 --> 01:15:04,900
放开我！放开我！不！
Let me go! Let me go! No!

868
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:06,820
- 这边  - 放开我！
- Over here. - Let me go!

869
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:11,860
别让她大声嚷嚷，用迷魂剂
Don't let her make so much noise. Use the chloroform.

870
01:15:44,230 --> 01:15:47,230
拉戈说过他会来，是吗？
Well, Largo did promise he'd come, didn't he?

871
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:49,440
别担心，他会到
He'll be here, don't worry.

872
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,490
詹姆斯，我想那家伙在向你打招呼
James, I think that man's waving at you.

873
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:54,670
下来这里

874
01:15:55,950 --> 01:15:57,120
快！
Quick!

875
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:00,580
失陪一下
Excuse me for a second.

876
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:05,460
- 詹姆斯，保拉不见了！ - 怎么会不见了？
- James, Paula's gone. - What do you mean "gone"?

877
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:08,630
不清楚，她已退房
I don't know. She just checked out of the hotel.

878
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:10,920
你照顾多米诺，看好她
You look after Domino. Watch her.

879
01:16:11,010 --> 01:16:12,010
你想她查到什么了吗？
Do you think she was on to something?

880
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:13,790
不知道，但我会查明
I don't know, but I've got to find out.

881
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:15,640
- 你看好她 - 好
- You watch out for her. - All right.

882
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:18,260
好，谢谢
Yeah, all right. Thank you.

883
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:20,700
总督不太开心
Governor's not very happy,

884
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:23,520
但已照你的要求全岛实施停电…
but you'll have a power cut as you requested all over the island.

885
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,940
我才不管岛上其他的地方
I don't give a damn about the rest of the island.

886
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:27,900
- 我只要帕米拉停电 - 没问题
- I just want the lights out in Palmyra. - You'll have it.

887
01:16:57,470 --> 01:16:59,640
什么意思，她不肯招？
What do you mean she won't talk?

888
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:01,600
别担心，她会招的
Don't worry. She will.

889
01:17:02,010 --> 01:17:03,470
怎么了？
What's wrong?

890
01:17:08,230 --> 01:17:10,070
迪米特里！停电了吗？
Dimitri! Is it a power failure?

891
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,880
对！全岛都停电了！
Yes! All over the island!

892
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:13,360
打开紧急发电机
Switch over to the emergency generator.

893
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:14,460
是，长官
Yes, sir.

894
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:54,110
拉戈告诉过你要小心
Largo told you to be careful.

895
01:17:54,690 --> 01:17:57,650
我没杀她，她一定是吞了毒药
I didn't kill her. She must have taken some poison.

896
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:01,030
藏在嘴里，是不是氰化物？
A capsule in the mouth. What do you think? Cyanide?

897
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:03,660
她死了
She's dead.

898
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:21,890
- 里卡多  - 怎么了？
- Ricardo. - What's happened?

899
01:18:21,970 --> 01:18:24,050
里卡多！有人打昏他
Ricardo! Someone's got him.

900
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:34,270
搜索那边，你，到鲨鱼池！
Search that way. And you, the sharks' pool!

901
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:40,990
- 怎么回事？ - 不知道
- What happened? - I don't know.

902
01:18:41,070 --> 01:18:42,820
别管他！这边！
Leave him! This way!

903
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:52,210
停！停！傻瓜！
Stop it! Stop it! You fools!

904
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,790
他让你们对彼此开枪！
He's got you all shooting at each other!

905
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,750
下面有动静！
It started down there!

906
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,060
这边！
Over here!

907
01:19:39,630 --> 01:19:42,130
不，我有更好的主意
No, no, no. I've got a better idea.

908
01:20:00,110 --> 01:20:03,320
- 打开水闸，让它们吃  - 是
- Lift the tunnel hatch and let them in. - Yes, sir.

909
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:18,600
抱歉，希望你下次好运点
Sorry, old chap. Better luck next time.

910
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:27,320
告诉莱特看紧那个女孩
Tell Leiter to stay with the girl.

911
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:29,230
我会马上回去找他
I'll get back to him just as soon as I can.

912
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:30,260
还有事吗？
Anything else?

913
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:31,700
- 告诉他保拉死了  - 好吧
- Tell him Paula's dead. - Okay.

914
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:12,530
喂！
Hello!

915
01:22:13,370 --> 01:22:16,200
你是不是走错房间了，邦德先生？
Aren't you in the wrong room, Mr. Bond?

916
01:22:16,290 --> 01:22:18,460
我站的地方可没错
Not from where I'm standing.

917
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:20,920
既然你来了
Since you are here,

918
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:23,390
能不能给我穿些什么？
would you mind giving me something to put on?

919
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:42,060
总之，很高兴再见到你，邦德先生
Anyway, I'm very glad to see you again, Mr. Bond.

920
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:44,150
我很也高兴再见到你
I'm glad to see you again.

921
01:22:44,770 --> 01:22:46,570
我感觉你在躲我
I had a feeling you've been avoiding me.

922
01:22:46,650 --> 01:22:49,860
我不知道我们是隔壁邻居
Well, you see, I had no idea that we were next-door neighbors.

923
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:52,360
他们今天下午才替我换房间
Oh, they just moved me down this afternoon.

924
01:22:52,450 --> 01:22:54,830
很不寻常是吧？似乎是…
It's extraordinary, isn't it? Almost as if...

925
01:22:54,910 --> 01:22:56,790
故意的
As if it was intended.

926
01:22:57,490 --> 01:22:59,910
是的，很不寻常
Yes, it is extraordinary.

927
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:03,130
你不要脱下湿衣服吗？
Shouldn't you get out of those wet clothes?

928
01:23:03,210 --> 01:23:05,790
你会因感冒致死
You'll catch your death of cold.

929
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:16,060
你知道，我们快要迟到了
Now look, you know we're going to be too late.

930
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:17,470
迟到什么？
Too late for what?

931
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:19,160
欢节庆
The Junkanoo.

932
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:21,600
我答应我朋友在那碰面
I promised my friends I'd meet them there.

933
01:23:21,690 --> 01:23:24,150
也许你认识他，拉戈
Perhaps you know them. The Largos.

934
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:28,440
问题，为何这么多问题
Questions, questions. All I get is questions.

935
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:31,320
反正节庆会进行一整晚
But the music is gonna go on all night anyhow.

936
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:33,280
- 足以让你好好狂野一下  - 是吗？
- Enough to drive you wild. - Yeah?

937
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:36,370
你喜欢狂野吗，邦德先生，詹姆斯・邦德？
Do you like wild things, Mr. Bond, James Bond?

938
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:39,790
狂野？
Wild?

939
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,410
你该被关进笼子里
You should be locked up in a cage.

940
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:50,240
这张床有如笼子的感觉
This bed feels like a cage.

941
01:23:50,290 --> 01:23:51,740
这些铜条
All these bars.

942
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:55,390
你认为我在这里安全吗？
Do you think I'll be safe?

943
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:09,380
你把我的头发搞的乱七八糟
You made a shocking mess out of my hair,

944
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:11,030
你这个性变态狂
you sadistic brute.

945
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:13,900
替我拉上拉链好吗？
Will you zip me up, please?

946
01:24:16,910 --> 01:24:19,490
难怪你衣服穿的这么快
No wonder you can get dressed so quickly.

947
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:22,120
路上，我们还可以聊聊
On the way we can have a little talk.

948
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:24,830
你会很有兴趣的，走
You may find it interesting. Come on.

949
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:26,470
我来了
I'm coming.

950
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:28,630
我不想错过什么
I hate to think I'm gonna miss anything.

951
01:24:32,590 --> 01:24:35,180
现在我们可以找个地方好好聊聊了
And now we can go somewhere for an interesting talk.

952
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:37,850
这绝对是你的朋友，请进！
Friends of yours, no doubt. Come in!

953
01:24:41,470 --> 01:24:42,630
你穿衣服也很快
You dress quickly, too.

954
01:24:42,690 --> 01:24:44,480
我从镜子里没看到枪
I didn't see that gun in the mirror.

955
01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:46,640
那无关紧要
Not that it matters,

956
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:48,940
但它一直都在枕头底下
but that was under the pillow all the time.

957
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:53,410
你什么时候发现的？
And when did you find out?

958
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:56,010
你戴的戒指跟拉戈戴的一样
You're wearing the same ring as Largo.

959
01:24:57,950 --> 01:24:59,480
是我喜欢戴的戒指
It's a ring I like to wear.

960
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,700
它本身有它的危险性
Vanity has its dangers.

961
01:25:01,790 --> 01:25:03,140
是虚荣，邦德先生
Vanity, Mr. Bond,

962
01:25:03,650 --> 01:25:06,040
那是一个你很了解的事
is something you know so much about.

963
01:25:06,130 --> 01:25:08,000
小姐，别往自己脸上贴金
My dear girl, don't flatter yourself.

964
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:10,380
我今晚所做的是为国王和国家
What I did this evening was for king and country.

965
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:13,550
你认为它带给我的是愉快吗？
You don't think it gave me any pleasure, do you?

966
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:21,720
当然，我忘了你的尊严
But of course! I forgot your ego, Mr. Bond.

967
01:25:21,970 --> 01:25:24,890
詹姆斯・邦德，只要他和女人做爱…
James Bond, who only has to make love to a woman

968
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:27,770
她就会听到天籁之音
and she starts to hear heavenly choirs singing.

969
01:25:27,850 --> 01:25:28,780
她懊悔
She repents,

970
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:32,170
而且立刻变得正派而纯洁
then immediately returns to the side of right and virtue.

971
01:25:33,730 --> 01:25:35,360
但不是这个女人
But not this one.

972
01:25:37,610 --> 01:25:39,180
真是不小的打击
What a blow it must have been,

973
01:25:39,330 --> 01:25:40,910
你竟会失败
you having a failure.

974
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:44,120
不能每次都赢
Well, can't win them all.

975
01:25:46,330 --> 01:25:49,120
由大厅带他出去，去开车
We'll take him out the front way. Go and get the car.

976
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:51,340
邦德先生，小心
Careful, Mr. Bond, now. Careful.

977
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:09,350
现在又要怎样？
Now look.

978
01:26:12,190 --> 01:26:15,110
通知帕米拉就说我们被欢节庆游行挡住了
Get through to Palmyra and tell them we're being held up by the Junkanoo.

979
01:26:16,610 --> 01:26:17,820
要喝酒吗？
Like to have a drink, man?

980
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:18,950
- 赶他走！  - 走开！
- Get him away! - Go away!

981
01:26:19,030 --> 01:26:20,660
- 你别轻举妄动 - 滚开！
- Don't you try anything now. - Get out of here!

982
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:23,870
- 试试，真的烈酒 - 滚开！滚开！
- Try it. It's real firewater. - Get out of it! Get out of here!

983
01:26:23,950 --> 01:26:26,500
喝一口，对你没什么害处
Have a sip. It can't harm you, ma'am.

984
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:34,380
追他！抓住他！
Go after him! Get him!

985
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,360
- 见到什么吗？  - 没有
- You haven't seen anything? - No.

986
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,560
看！
Look!

987
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:58,070
跟踪他，你走这边，你那边
Follow it. You, that side. You, there.

988
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:03,180
跟着我们
Stay with us now.

989
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:04,420
（亲亲俱乐部）

990
01:30:01,290 --> 01:30:03,920
- 谢谢，我非常乐意  - 乐意什么？
- Thank you. I'd love to. - Love to what?

991
01:30:07,260 --> 01:30:09,720
你疯了！你知道吗？
Oh, you're mad! Do you know that?

992
01:30:09,970 --> 01:30:11,760
对，大家伙不都这样？
Yes! Isn't everyone?

993
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:16,810
我能介入吗？
May I cut in?

994
01:30:16,890 --> 01:30:19,640
你该告诉我，你太太也在这里
You should've told me your wife was here.

995
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:32,530
你常来吗？
Do you come here often?

996
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:35,540
你想逃跑是没有用的，邦德先生
It's no good you trying to escape, Mr. Bond.

997
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:38,390
我不想逃
I don't want to escape.

998
01:30:39,310 --> 01:30:41,720
看起来很奇怪
Strange as it may seem,

999
01:30:41,790 --> 01:30:43,480
我已经习惯你的脸了
I've grown accustomed to your face.

1000
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:57,100
你何不安安静静的跟我们走？
Why don't you come with us quietly?

1001
01:30:57,930 --> 01:30:59,560
你好像不太了解
You don't seem to understand.

1002
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:01,580
我很享受这个时刻
You see, I enjoy my dancing.

1003
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,420
不介意我朋友坐一下吗？
Mind if my friend sits this one out?

1004
01:31:42,510 --> 01:31:43,830
她刚刚死
She's just dead!

1005
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:57,400
你们在早上六点离开
You'll leave at 06:00 hours

1006
01:31:57,460 --> 01:31:59,140
停在雅典加油
and land at Aden to refuel.

1007
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:03,840
然后你们将去丹老群岛执行空投
You will then proceed to the Mergui Archipelago to make your drop

1008
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:06,070
一定要瞄准在北纬20度
precisely at 20 degrees north,

1009
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:07,380
东经60度
60 degrees east.

1010
01:32:08,210 --> 01:32:10,710
钻石将装在特殊的容器内
The diamonds will be in a special container...

1011
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,880
我不喜欢像这样的让步
I hate to give in like this.

1012
01:32:12,970 --> 01:32:15,640
付了一大笔钱，还让他这样要挟我们
Paying them blood money. Letting them beat us.

1013
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:17,580
有别的选择吗？
Have you an alternative suggestion?

1014
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:18,990
恐怕没有
I'm afraid I haven't.

1015
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:21,850
你的手下，007，我以为他会调查出什么端倪
Your man 007, I thought he was on to something.

1016
01:32:21,930 --> 01:32:23,100
我也这么认为
I thought so too, sir.

1017
01:32:23,180 --> 01:32:25,150
- 假警报？  - 恐怕是
- False alarm? - Afraid so.

1018
01:32:25,230 --> 01:32:27,400
很显然他极具戏剧性
He obviously has a highly developed sense of,

1019
01:32:27,570 --> 01:32:28,820
容我这么说
shall we say, drama?

1020
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:30,820
如果007认为他查到什么…
If 007 thought he was on to something...

1021
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:34,150
很可惜他在开始前没查清楚
It's a great pity he didn't make sure before he started to shout the odds.

1022
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:37,030
我们还剩下14小时50分
Well, we have exactly 14 hours and 50 minutes.

1023
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:38,410
然后我们就得付款
And then I suppose we shall have to pay up

1024
01:32:38,490 --> 01:32:40,910
而且且要装出笑脸，对吧？
and look as happy as we can, shan't we?

1025
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:21,330
就是这样了，詹姆斯，几乎全找过了
Well, that's it, James. We've looked about everywhere.

1026
01:33:21,410 --> 01:33:23,620
我们一定要找到那飞机
We've got to find that plane.

1027
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:29,420
下面找不到，那是黄金礁
You won't find it down there. That's the Golden Grotto.

1028
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:32,100
黄金礁？
Golden Grotto?

1029
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,760
是的 你在那里只能找到鲨鱼
Yeah. All you'll find down there are sharks.

1030
01:33:37,220 --> 01:33:39,890
- 降低点，我要靠近点看  - 看什么？
- Take it down. I want a closer look. - Closer look at what?

1031
01:33:39,970 --> 01:33:42,310
别管！快降低点！
Never mind! Take it down quick!

1032
01:33:49,270 --> 01:33:52,190
降低点，我想我们找到了
Set her down, Felix. I think we've found it.

1033
01:34:03,330 --> 01:34:07,000
下面有反光，我去看看
There's something camouflaged down there. I'll take a look.

1034
01:34:07,370 --> 01:34:09,210
射杀其中一条鲨鱼，让其他鲨鱼忙一阵子
Shoot one of those sharks. It'll keep the others occupied.

1035
01:34:09,290 --> 01:34:10,290
是的
Right.

1036
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:23,640
我不知道多久他们会吃光它
I don't know how long the others will take before they finish him off,

1037
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:24,810
但它们会回来
but they'll be back.

1038
01:34:24,890 --> 01:34:27,230
- 我会注意  - 很好
- I'll keep an eye on them. - Good.

1039
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:34,440
带上这些
Take these.

1040
01:36:38,980 --> 01:36:40,070
它在下面
She's down there, all right.

1041
01:36:40,150 --> 01:36:42,280
- 炸弹在船上吗？  - 不在
- Are the bombs on board? - No.

1042
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:44,350
真要命，下一步怎么做？
Oh, great! Now, what's our next move?

1043
01:36:44,870 --> 01:36:46,430
我们去查迪斯科-沃兰特号
We'll check on the Disco Volante.

1044
01:36:46,490 --> 01:36:48,910
就算炸弹不在船上也马上就会到
If the bombs aren't on board her now, they soon will be.

1045
01:36:48,990 --> 01:36:51,330
你要问谁，拉戈吗？
Who are you going to ask? Largo?

1046
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:54,080
没有必要
No, I don't think we'll have to.

1047
01:37:48,550 --> 01:37:51,050
我希望我们没吓到鱼
I hope we didn't frighten the fish.

1048
01:37:55,180 --> 01:37:56,230
海胆的刺！
Sea egg spines.

1049
01:37:56,290 --> 01:37:57,580
有毒！
They're poisonous!

1050
01:37:57,770 --> 01:37:59,690
手给我
Here, give me your arm.

1051
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:04,280
坐下
Sit down.

1052
01:38:05,940 --> 01:38:07,450
转身
Now turn over.

1053
01:38:10,370 --> 01:38:12,490
会有点痛
This is going to hurt a bit.

1054
01:38:21,580 --> 01:38:23,960
我第一次尝女人的味道，还不错
It's the first time I've tasted women. They're rather good.

1055
01:38:24,050 --> 01:38:26,100
你是唯一让我哭的男人
You're the only man to ever make me cry.

1056
01:38:26,550 --> 01:38:29,590
除了我的哥哥弗朗索瓦，那时我们还是孩子
Except perhaps Fran?ois, my brother, when we were children.

1057
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:30,850
多米诺
Domino,

1058
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:32,600
我得告诉你一件事
I have to tell you something.

1059
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:35,820
抱歉，詹姆斯
I'm sorry, James.

1060
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,380
我不是故意要谈起爱让你难堪
I didn't mean to embarrass you, speaking of love.

1061
01:38:38,530 --> 01:38:40,320
- 我知道…  - 我必须再次伤害你
- I know... - I must hurt you again.

1062
01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:41,770
你要离开了吗？
You're going away.

1063
01:38:42,270 --> 01:38:44,900
宝贝，抱歉，都结束了
So sorry, my dear, but it's all over.

1064
01:38:45,270 --> 01:38:47,190
不，是有关你哥的事
No, it's about your brother.

1065
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:48,820
他怎么了？
What about him?

1066
01:39:01,960 --> 01:39:03,290
弗朗索瓦
Fran?ois.

1067
01:39:08,420 --> 01:39:09,630
他…
He's...

1068
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:17,020
他死了？
He's dead?

1069
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:21,990
发生什么事？
What happened?

1070
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:23,750
说来话长
It's a long story.

1071
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:27,150
这跟你朋友拉戈有关
And it involves your friend Largo.

1072
01:39:38,830 --> 01:39:40,620
多米诺，我需要你帮忙
Domino, I need your help.

1073
01:39:40,770 --> 01:39:42,020
当然
Of course.

1074
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:45,180
你是为此才和我做爱
That's why you made love to me.

1075
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:47,770
我无法解释这是怎么回事
Look, I can't explain what this is all about,

1076
01:39:47,970 --> 01:39:49,440
但你一定要相信我
but you must trust me.

1077
01:39:49,510 --> 01:39:51,060
因为你要我帮你？
Because you want me to help you?

1078
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:52,780
拉戈派人谋杀你哥
Look, Largo had your brother murdered,

1079
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:54,090
或是他下的命令
or it was on his orders.

1080
01:39:54,180 --> 01:39:57,430
数以千计的人马上会死掉…
Thousands, hundreds of thousands of people will die, and very soon,

1081
01:39:57,510 --> 01:39:59,350
如果你不帮我的话
if you don't help me.

1082
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:05,320
那是我们所知道的
That much we do know.

1083
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:07,010
还有我们不知道的事…
But there's something we don't.

1084
01:40:07,270 --> 01:40:10,740
炸弹，几时会运到迪斯科-沃兰特号上？
The bombs, when they're being loaded aboard the Disco Volante.

1085
01:40:10,820 --> 01:40:11,930
我怎么才会知道？
How could I know that?

1086
01:40:12,110 --> 01:40:13,690
你必须查明
That you'll have to find out.

1087
01:40:15,910 --> 01:40:17,250
这不容易
It won't be easy.

1088
01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:19,040
可能会很危险
It could be very dangerous.

1089
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:21,950
他还能对我做什么事？
What can he do to me he hasn't already done?

1090
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:23,710
你肯做吗？
Then you'll do it?

1091
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:26,720
是的
Yes.

1092
01:40:27,070 --> 01:40:27,670
很好
Good.

1093
01:40:28,710 --> 01:40:30,130
这是盖格计数器
This is a Geiger counter.

1094
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:31,510
你按这个
You press this lever.

1095
01:40:31,590 --> 01:40:34,460
如果开始有响声，表示核弹已经在船上
If it starts clicking, it means the bombs are aboard.

1096
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:35,900
那时我该怎么办？
What do I do then?

1097
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,270
到甲板上去
Go straight up on deck.

1098
01:40:37,550 --> 01:40:40,500
当迪斯科-沃兰特号被监视时，你会被发现
As the Disco Volante is being watched, you'll be spotted.

1099
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:42,460
瓦格斯在你后面
Vargas is behind you.

1100
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:45,690
真的？
Really?

1101
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:50,530
他一定跟踪我们
He must have followed us.

1102
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:57,120
我想他懂意思了
I think he got the point.

1103
01:40:57,200 --> 01:40:59,240
应该是拉戈
It should have been Largo.

1104
01:40:59,780 --> 01:41:00,910
拉戈？
Largo.

1105
01:41:01,410 --> 01:41:02,670
他期望你什么时候回去？
When did he expect you back?

1106
01:41:02,770 --> 01:41:03,930
很快了
Very soon now.

1107
01:41:04,110 --> 01:41:05,090
他说别太晚
He said not to be late.

1108
01:41:05,130 --> 01:41:07,230
他对这点非常坚持
He was most insistent.

1109
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:08,990
你最好直接回去
You better go straight back.

1110
01:41:09,020 --> 01:41:10,440
我来料理瓦格斯和剩下的一切
I'll take care of Vargas and everything here.

1111
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:12,210
詹姆斯，要明白
James, understand,

1112
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:14,010
我是为了我哥这么做的
I'm doing this for my brother,

1113
01:41:14,090 --> 01:41:15,510
为了他对他做的事
for what he did to him.

1114
01:41:15,590 --> 01:41:16,720
答应我一件事
But promise me one thing.

1115
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:18,960
不论发生什么事，你要杀了拉戈
You will kill Largo for me whatever happens.

1116
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:25,690
- 时间不多了 - 好
- You haven't much time. - All right.

1117
01:41:25,770 --> 01:41:27,150
我想起一件事
Oh, something I remembered.

1118
01:41:27,230 --> 01:41:28,270
也许不重要
It may not be important.

1119
01:41:28,340 --> 01:41:29,520
告诉我，每件事都很重要
Tell me. Everything is important.

1120
01:41:29,610 --> 01:41:31,340
运河上有条小桥
There's a small bridge over the canal.

1121
01:41:31,490 --> 01:41:33,880
拉戈绝不准陌生人靠近
Largo never allows strangers to go near it.

1122
01:41:34,230 --> 01:41:36,080
运河旁有一列台阶
By the canal, there's a flight of steps.

1123
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:37,550
通向哪儿？
Where do the steps lead to?

1124
01:41:37,610 --> 01:41:40,420
向下通往海底，帕米拉寓所的远方
Down into the sea, on the far side of Palmyra.

1125
01:41:40,950 --> 01:41:43,210
也许还是很重要
Perhaps it is important, after all.

1126
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:16,210
穿上装备
Put on your equipment.

1127
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:35,650
是否收到女孩登上迪斯科・沃兰特号的讯息？
Did we get a message saying the girl went on board the Disco?

1128
01:43:35,730 --> 01:43:37,730
是的，讯号已经收到…
- Oh, yes, sir. Signal received at... - Okay, okay.

1129
01:43:37,820 --> 01:43:40,830
- 如果她已上船，007又在哪？ - 这是个问题
- If she is on board, where's 007 now? - That's a question.

1130
01:43:43,740 --> 01:43:45,620
准备出发，倒数五秒
Stand by. Five seconds.

1131
01:43:46,660 --> 01:43:48,240
注意我的讯号
Watch my signal.

1132
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:36,170
- 准备出发 - 遵命，船长
- Prepare to get underway. - All right, Captain.

1133
01:44:39,710 --> 01:44:42,170
船长，起锚
Captain, weigh anchor.

1134
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:44,550
立刻出发
Get underway immediately.

1135
01:44:44,630 --> 01:44:45,990
一旦取了货物
Once we pick up the merchandise,

1136
01:44:46,190 --> 01:44:48,660
就前往目标区，迈阿密
head for our target area, Miami.

1137
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:58,690
迪斯科-沃兰特号出发了
The Disco Volante is leaving, sir.

1138
01:49:08,230 --> 01:49:09,860
我告诉过你待在舱房里
I told you to stay in your cabin.

1139
01:49:09,940 --> 01:49:11,360
里面很闷，我要透透空气
It's stuffy in there. I want a breath of air.

1140
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:13,650
宝贝，你没听见吗？
My dear, did you not hear me?

1141
01:49:14,030 --> 01:49:15,820
- 那个哪来的？ - 今早买的
- Where did you get that? - I bought it this morning.

1142
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:18,120
- 让我看 - 不要，为什么要让你看？
- Let me see. - No, why should I?

1143
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:27,420
我猜是邦德先生给你的吧
Mr. Bond gave you this little toy, I imagine.

1144
01:49:28,250 --> 01:49:30,000
而且瓦格斯已经死了！
And Vargas is dead!

1145
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:36,180
宝贝，你已经无路可逃
No, my dear, there is no escape for you.

1146
01:49:36,340 --> 01:49:39,090
像你的朋友，你有点太聪明了
Like your friend, you've been a little too clever.

1147
01:49:39,180 --> 01:49:40,680
现在你被逮到！
And now you are caught!

1148
01:50:28,730 --> 01:50:31,360
多米诺，你给了我很多快乐
You've given me much pleasure, Domino.

1149
01:50:32,650 --> 01:50:36,110
除非你告诉我邦德知道多少…
But in return, unless you tell me how much Bond knows,

1150
01:50:36,860 --> 01:50:39,570
不然我就被迫回报你极大的痛苦
I'll be forced to cause you great pain.

1151
01:50:40,090 --> 01:50:41,720
这代表热
This for heat,

1152
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:44,100
这代表冷
these for cold.

1153
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:47,200
很科学化，很缓慢
Applied scientifically and slowly.

1154
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:50,500
非常非常的慢
Very, very slowly.

1155
01:51:02,010 --> 01:51:02,940
你要什么？
What do you want?

1156
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:04,280
我们启动炸弹了
We're activating the bombs.

1157
01:51:04,330 --> 01:51:05,740
你说你想知道
You said you wanted to be told.

1158
01:51:05,800 --> 01:51:07,100
是的
Oh, yes.

1159
01:51:08,730 --> 01:51:10,320
一点私事，我的朋友
A private little matter, my friend,

1160
01:51:10,390 --> 01:51:12,630
小姐和我之间的
between the young woman and myself.

1161
01:51:13,020 --> 01:51:14,020
走！
Go!

1162
01:51:14,860 --> 01:51:16,420
别指望了，亲爱的
Do not live in hope, my dear.

1163
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,300
没人来救你
There is no one to rescue you.

1164
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:35,460
继续！
Now go on.

1165
01:51:36,550 --> 01:51:38,750
幸好他吞下的自动发报器…
It's a good thing the homing capsule he swallowed...

1166
01:51:38,810 --> 01:51:40,360
仍管用
is still working.

1167
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:41,970
直直前进
Straight ahead.

1168
01:51:46,850 --> 01:51:48,720
向右，向右！
Go right. Go on right!

1169
01:52:09,750 --> 01:52:11,250
找到他了！
Good. That's him!

1170
01:52:27,550 --> 01:52:28,760
停！
Hold it!

1171
01:52:39,780 --> 01:52:40,820
往上！
Up!

1172
01:52:54,830 --> 01:52:57,920
用无线电通知奥兰多海滩！
Get your radio man on to Orlando Beach!

1173
01:52:58,380 --> 01:53:00,710
警告他们，目标是迈阿密！
Warn them the target is Miami!

1174
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:03,970
还有，核弹已经从迪斯科-沃兰特号上转移了
Also, the bomb is transferred from the Disco Volante

1175
01:53:04,050 --> 01:53:05,720
在福雷角的一艘沉船附近！
onto a wreck off Fowley Point!

1176
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:07,720
对，抓住这个
Right. Hang on to that.

1177
01:55:57,510 --> 01:55:58,810
希望还沉得下去！
And the kitchen sink!

1178
01:55:59,010 --> 01:56:01,000
一切看来很好
On you, everything looks good.

1179
01:56:01,940 --> 01:56:03,270
拿着
Take this.

1180
01:56:08,980 --> 01:56:10,320
祝好运
Good luck.

1181
02:03:15,740 --> 02:03:17,870
- 起锚！ - 是
- Weigh anchor! - Aye aye, sir.

1182
02:03:45,690 --> 02:03:48,280
- 放烟雾 - 现在
- Make smoke! - Making smoke now.

1183
02:03:49,240 --> 02:03:52,110
（迪斯科・沃兰特号，巴拿马）

1184
02:03:56,200 --> 02:03:59,040
- 准备分隔 - 待命
- Stand by for conversion. - Standing by.

1185
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:04,630
分隔
Jettison cocoon!

1186
02:04:12,340 --> 02:04:13,890
分隔完成
Cocoon's away.

1187
02:04:27,070 --> 02:04:29,280
继续开火！他们接近了！
Keep firing! They're closing!

1188
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,800
加强火力！在那边！
Come on! Fire! More! More! Over there!

1189
02:05:05,020 --> 02:05:06,650
离开那里
Away from there.

1190
02:05:07,310 --> 02:05:09,650
我们仍有一枚炸弹在船上
We've still got one bomb aboard.

1191
02:05:10,530 --> 02:05:12,030
他发疯了！
He's gone mad!

1192
02:05:12,650 --> 02:05:14,740
请帮我跟他们说
Please talk to them for me.

1193
02:05:15,110 --> 02:05:17,330
告诉他们我只是做我该做的
Tell them that I only did what I had to do,

1194
02:05:17,420 --> 02:05:19,070
我只是奉命行事
what I was told to do.

1195
02:05:31,210 --> 02:05:32,420
他在哪儿？
Where is he?

1196
02:05:32,510 --> 02:05:35,170
炸弹现在不能引爆
Look, the bomb cannot be exploded now.

1197
02:05:35,260 --> 02:05:37,010
我把引爆器丢进海里
I threw the arming device into the sea.

1198
02:05:37,090 --> 02:05:39,010
- 明白吗？ - 是
- Do you understand? - Yes.

1199
02:05:48,150 --> 02:05:49,770
抓住他！抓住他！
Get him! Get him!

1200
02:07:34,290 --> 02:07:35,910
我很高兴我杀死他了
I'm glad I killed him.

1201
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:37,130
你很高兴？
You're glad!

1202
02:07:38,090 --> 02:07:38,960
他是谁？
Who's he?

1203
02:07:39,080 --> 02:07:40,880
不知道，但他帮了我
I don't know but he helped me.

1204
02:07:41,550 --> 02:07:43,010
小心！礁石！
Look out! The rocks!

1205
02:07:43,550 --> 02:07:44,610
暗礁！
The reef!

1206
02:07:46,890 --> 02:07:49,350
控制器卡住了！走！
He's jammed the controls! Come on!

1207
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:51,230
- 快跳！ - 我不会游泳！
- Come on, now, jump! - I didn't learn to swim.

1208
02:07:51,310 --> 02:07:53,270
现在学还不迟
Never too late to learn.

1209
02:07:56,860 --> 02:07:58,150
潜下去！
Get down!
