1
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,878
Five, four, three...

2
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,554
...two, one.

3
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,119
Ready or not, here I come.

4
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,679
Hey, Dad?

5
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,752
Dad!

6
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,469
You'll stay with Aunt May...

7
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,358
...and Uncle Ben for a little while.

8
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,596
-I wanna go with you.
-No.

9
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,837
Doesn't like crust
on his sandwiches...

10
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,150
...and he likes to sleep
with a little light on.

11
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,356
-Mary. Come on, come on.
-Oh, God.

12
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,839
Dad.

13
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,272
Be good.

14
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,117
Sorry.

15
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,033
Morning, Flash.

16
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,871
Good morning, Parker.

17
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,869
Hey. It's Peter, right?

18
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,993
I really like your photos.

19
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,718
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

20
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,796
Listen...

21
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,234
...are you busy Friday night?

22
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,393
Cool. Can you take pictures
of my boyfriend's car?

23
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,471
You know, I really wanna frame
a good one...

24
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,675
...for his birthday.

25
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,798
That's really nice of you.
Wow, that's such a nice thought.

26
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,191
Yeah, I'll have a look at the old....

27
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,032
-The old schedule.
-Okay.

28
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,229
Parker.

29
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,356
-Yes, sir?
-You want to keep that skateboard?

30
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,953
-Yeah.
-Keep it off the ground.

31
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,394
-Sure. Yeah.
-Wheels up.

32
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,629
Like that?

33
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,438
-That's it.
-Okay.

34
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,834
Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!

35
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,319
Eat it! Eat it!

36
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,914
Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!

37
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,389
Eat your vegetables, Gordon.
Come on!

38
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,959
Come on!

39
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,235
Hey, Parker, come on.

40
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,719
Get a picture of this.

41
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,917
No, I'm not gonna take a picture of it.
Put him down, man.

42
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,957
-Come on.
-Gordon, don't eat it.

43
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,109
Take the picture.

44
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,679
Put him down, Flash.

45
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,353
Take the picture.

46
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,988
Put him down, Eugene!

47
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,194
Hey, man.

48
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,597
Come on!

49
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,397
Get up, Parker!

50
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,677
Get up!

51
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,398
Come on! Come on!

52
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,197
Get up!

53
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,314
Still not taking the picture.

54
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,074
Stay down, Parker!

55
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,993
Who wants one more?

56
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,673
-One more!
-Flash!

57
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,479
Flash...

58
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,437
...we still on for after school today?

59
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,669
My house, 3:.30?

60
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,989
I hope you did homework.

61
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,593
Last time, I was...

62
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,309
...disappointed in you.

63
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,471
-Okay, move.
-No, how about we go to class?

64
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,789
How about it?

65
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,999
Whatever.

66
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,877
I thought that was great
what you did.

67
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,790
It was stupid...

68
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,470
...but it was great.

69
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,270
You should go to...

70
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,112
...the nurse.
You might have a concussion.

71
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,030
What's your name?

72
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,635
You don't know my name?

73
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,712
No, I know your name.

74
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,512
I want to know
if you know your name.

75
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,679
Peter.

76
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,790
-Parker. Peter Parker.
-Okay. Okay, good.

77
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,678
I'd still go to the nurse though.

78
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,034
You're Gwen, right?

79
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,349
Gwen Stacy.

80
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,278
All right.

81
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,072
Hey.

82
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,116
I'm making...

83
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,918
...spaghetti and meatballs tonight.

84
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,630
You're serious?
Spaghetti and meatballs.

85
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,349
Since when don't you like
spaghetti and meatballs, huh?

86
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,472
-Oh, my God.
-What's up?

87
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,119
What happened to your face?

88
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,555
I'm all right. Just-- I fell, skating.

89
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,233
It's all right.

90
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,831
Ben Parker, don't you even...

91
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,833
...think about leaving
that filthy box in my kitchen.

92
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,989
My bowling trophies.

93
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,639
Oh, well, then, by all means...

94
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,233
...Ieave that box in my kitchen.

95
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,799
-What happened to you?
-He fell.

96
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,633
Why you kids ride those things,
I'll never know.

97
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,313
Because it's stupid and dangerous.

98
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,038
Remember when we were stupid?

99
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,155
No.

100
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,356
-Trust me, we were.
-All right. Good to know.

101
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,396
Where's the flood?

102
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,993
Follow me. I'll show you.

103
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,309
-You serious?
-Yes.

104
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,029
All right.

105
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,750
It's the condenser tray.

106
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,358
Too much water for the condenser tray
or the heat exchange tubing.

107
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,351
This has got to be the fill line.

108
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,795
That's the only thing
that makes any sense.

109
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,234
Can you fix it?

110
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,519
No, not tonight.
I'll go by the hardware store tomorrow.

111
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,989
Good deal. And meanwhile,
put this on your face.

112
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,558
How's the other guy look?

113
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,072
Come on.
I know a right cross when I see one.

114
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,879
Yes or no?
Do I have to call somebody's father?

115
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,276
No, no.

116
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,475
All right.

117
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,631
Well, I wouldn't tell your Aunt May.

118
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,953
I pity the poor kid
who'd have to suffer her wrath.

119
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,073
Before you come up, see if...

120
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,549
-...there's anything else worth saving.
-Okay.

121
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,916
-Plumbers don't fix appliances.
-Yes, they do.

122
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,593
They fix pipes and pump things.

123
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,512
If you ask them to--

124
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,200
I forgot all about that thing.

125
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,190
It was your dad's.

126
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,112
-Yeah.
-He asked us to keep it safe.

127
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,231
He saw it in the window of that
leather shop over on 9th Avenue.

128
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,912
He was 19. What does a 19-year-old kid
need with a briefcase?

129
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,799
And guess who sold it to him.

130
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,552
-I don't know.
-Your mother.

131
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,755
That's how they met.

132
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,630
He asked you to...

133
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,677
...keep this safe?
There's nothing in here.

134
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,512
Have you looked?
There's nothing here.

135
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,716
Your father was
a very secretive man, Peter.

136
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,279
Yeah, I know.

137
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,990
Who's that?

138
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,639
Do you know who that is?

139
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,074
Some guy who worked with...

140
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,309
...your dad, I guess.

141
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,831
Just take this off the table, all right?

142
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,912
We're gonna eat. Off.
And wash your hands.

143
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,877
-Now.
-All right.

144
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,995
Go on.

145
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,713
I need you to be a good boy.

146
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,949
Where are you going?

147
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,235
There's something...

148
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,311
...your mom and I have to do.

149
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,308
What is this?

150
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,236
"Zero, zero, decay rate algorithm."

151
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,472
Yeah, one sec, one sec.

152
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,878
Come in.

153
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,316
You okay?

154
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,710
-Yeah. What's up?
-Oh, my God.

155
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,108
You look just like him.

156
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,951
-Can I come in?
-Yeah.

157
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,031
Listen...

158
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,599
...I don't have much education.

159
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,159
You know that, Peter.

160
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,831
Hell, I stopped being able to help
with your homework when you were 10.

161
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,475
What I'm trying to say is...

162
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,275
...I know it's been rough
for you without your dad.

163
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,517
And I know we don't talk
much about them.

164
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,511
-Yeah, it's all right.
-No, it is not...

165
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,999
...all right.

166
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,520
I wish I could change it, but I can't.

167
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,639
Curt Connors.

168
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,913
That's the name of the guy
in the picture with your dad.

169
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,310
They worked together for years
and they were close.

170
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,755
But after that night,
we never saw him again.

171
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,793
He never even called.

172
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,109
Not once.

173
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,078
Go figure.

174
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,471
She's pretty.

175
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,669
Uncle Ben.

176
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,034
What?

177
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,033
You're a pretty great dad.

178
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,028
Excuse me.

179
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,950
What?

180
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,633
Can I help you?

181
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,392
I don't know. I'm here to see...

182
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,959
-...Dr. Connors.
-Right.

183
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,917
You'll find yourself to the left.

184
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,352
You are here for the internship?

185
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,508
Yeah. Yeah.

186
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,715
Okay.

187
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,677
You'll find your badge to the left.

188
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,268
Having trouble finding yourself?

189
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,876
No. Yeah, I got it.

190
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,076
Okay...

191
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,037
...Mr. Guevara.

192
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,076
Welcome to Oscorp.

193
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,959
Born from the mind of our founder,
Norman Osborn...

194
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,635
... the Oscorp Tower houses
108 floors of innovation.

195
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,599
Our scientific minds are pushing the
boundaries of defence, biomedical...

196
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,433
...and chemical technologies.
The future lies within.

197
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,835
Welcome to Oscorp.

198
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,228
I'm Gwen Stacy, a senior...

199
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,230
...at Midtown Science...

200
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,753
...and head intern to Dr. Connors.

201
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,990
I'll be with you
for the duration of your visit.

202
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,748
Where I go, you go.

203
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,558
That's the rule. Remember that...

204
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,119
-...all will be fine.
-Come on!

205
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,599
-lf you forget that--
-Listen!

206
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,636
Look, listen.

207
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,313
Tell them Rodrigo Guevara is here.

208
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,515
Just tell them...

209
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,669
...Rodrigo Guevara is here!

210
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,955
My name's Rodrigo!

211
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,839
I guess I don't need to tell you
what happens if you forget.

212
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,317
Shall we?

213
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,558
Come around this way.

214
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,715
Good afternoon, Gwen.

215
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,790
Dr. Connors.

216
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,630
Welcome.

217
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,473
My name is Dr. Curtis Connors.

218
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,790
Yes, in case you're wondering,
I'm a southpaw.

219
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,154
I'm not a cripple...

220
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,517
...I'm a scientist, and the world's
foremost authority on herpetology.

221
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,319
That's reptiles,
for those of you who don't know.

222
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,879
Like the Parkinson's patient...

223
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,634
...who watches on in horror
as her body...

224
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,076
...slowly betrays her, or the man
with macular degeneration...

225
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,915
...whose eyes grow dimmer each day,
I long to fix myself.

226
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,755
I want to create a world
without weakness.

227
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,753
Anyone care to venture a guess
just how?

228
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,070
Yes.

229
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,150
Stem cells?

230
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,833
Promising. But the solution...

231
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,673
...I'm thinking of is more radical.

232
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,359
-No one?
-Cross-species genetics.

233
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,429
Person gets Parkinson's...

234
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,875
...when the brain cells
that produce dopamine...

235
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,951
...start to disappear.

236
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,712
But a zebra fish has the ability...

237
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,996
...to regenerate cells on command.

238
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,998
If you could give this ability...

239
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,913
...to the woman you're talking about,
that's that. She's....

240
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,194
She's curing herself.

241
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,114
Yeah, you just have to look past
the gills on her neck.

242
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,675
And you are...?

243
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,557
He's one of Midtown Science's...

244
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,153
-...best and brightest.
-Really?

245
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,275
Second in his class.

246
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,112
-Second?
-Yeah.

247
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,076
Sure about that?

248
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,639
I'm pretty sure.

249
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,709
I'm afraid duty calls. I'll leave you in the
more-than-capable hands of Miss Stacy.

250
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,678
Nice meeting you all.

251
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,113
If you'd like to gather round.

252
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,191
Welcome to Oscorp's tree of life.

253
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,639
Our planet's tree of life is immense.

254
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,275
At Oscorp's...

255
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,078
-...Cross-Species Division...
-Hi.

256
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,118
...we endeavour to explore
exciting new methods....

257
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,629
What are you doing, "Rodrigo"?

258
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,749
Oh, yeah.

259
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,114
What are you doing here?

260
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,395
I work here. I don't.

261
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,073
I was gonna say I work here...

262
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,312
...but it seems like you do work here.
So you know that I don't.

263
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,310
You following me?

264
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,472
No, I'm not following you, no.
I had no idea you worked here.

265
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,789
Why would you be here?

266
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,712
I just snuck in because....

267
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,233
I love science.

268
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,118
-You love it.
-I'm passionate about it.

269
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,838
So you snuck in--?

270
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,070
-I have to lead this tour group.
-I know.

271
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,038
I'll ask you more about this later.
Do not get me in trouble.

272
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,350
-I promise you I won't.
-Stay with the group.

273
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,310
All right, guys? I'm gonna take you
to the bioreactor room now.

274
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,393
Sorry. Yo.

275
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,795
Sorry.

276
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,790
We received the results from
the mRNA sequences this morning.

277
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,633
They were disappointing.

278
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,275
Define "disappointing."

279
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,714
Another dead end.

280
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,472
It's the decay rate algorithm.

281
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,036
-And this is to be expected.
-Expected?

282
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,474
You said you were close.

283
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,710
We are close,
but it's gonna take time.

284
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,029
He doesn't have time.

285
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,395
Norman Osborn is dying,
Dr. Connors.

286
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,114
Save him.

287
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,112
Or we'll both lose our heads.

288
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,159
All right, give me the badge.

289
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,554
Give it to me.

290
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,399
Sorry.

291
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,075
Disgusting. Now I smell like beer.

292
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,715
I didn't mean to do that.

293
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,233
I didn't mean to....

294
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,072
I didn't-- I didn't--

295
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,475
Get your hand off her!

296
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,232
I'm trying to get my....

297
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,636
Are you kidding?

298
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,550
I'm sorry.

299
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,869
Are you kidding me?

300
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,078
-Hey, get him, Rudy!
-Hey!

301
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,355
Man, I'm sorry!

302
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,555
Man, are you all right?

303
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,839
-Take him down!
-Come on.

304
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,873
Get him, man! Get him!

305
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,754
No, man, no. Not my board.

306
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,148
Please, dude, don't--

307
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,035
Sorry!

308
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,790
Sorry. Sorry.

309
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,188
I'm so sorry.

310
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,429
Coney Island, next stop.

311
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,477
Next and final stop, Coney Island.

312
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,637
Hey.

313
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,034
Hey. Hey.

314
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,349
Sorry. I'm late.

315
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,112
-I got--
-We've been so worried.

316
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,349
I know. I'm sorry.

317
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,794
Watch out!

318
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,709
That's a fly, Peter.

319
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,193
Yeah.

320
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,395
I'm so sorry...

321
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,675
...I kept you guys up.

322
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,037
I'm insensitive, I'm irresponsible...

323
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,913
...and I'm hungry.

324
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,752
Meat loaf.

325
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,349
Drinking?

326
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,509
What's this?

327
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,999
I don't think so.

328
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,752
This is your meat loaf.

329
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,836
This beats all other meat loafs.

330
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,991
Something is very wrong.

331
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,595
Yeah.

332
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,716
Nobody likes your meat loaf.

333
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,073
I got it.

334
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,670
He took the frozen
macaroni and cheese.

335
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,588
I noticed that.

336
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,234
Why didn't you tell me
you didn't like my meat loaf?

337
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,596
You could have said that to me
37 years ago.

338
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,320
How many meat loafs
have I made for you?

339
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,196
Peter.

340
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,589
What are you doing?

341
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,193
I'm....

342
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,190
Homework.

343
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,839
Be careful.

344
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,513
Sure.

345
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,719
Dr. Connors.

346
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,068
You don't remember me. I--

347
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,434
The intern from the other day.

348
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,592
Yeah, yeah. That's right, yeah.

349
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,955
I'm sure you're very nice,
but this is a home.

350
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,350
I ask you to make an appointment
with my office.

351
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,839
I'm Richard Parker's son.

352
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,949
Peter?

353
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,117
I'm afraid...

354
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,431
...I can't help you much. I don't know
why they left or where they...

355
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,316
...were going.

356
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,399
Good reflexes.

357
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,879
Thank you.

358
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,671
-Thank you.
-I read your book.

359
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,239
Yeah.

360
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,515
It's something, you know.

361
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,398
So you really think...

362
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,154
-...it's possible, cross-species genetics?
-Yes, of course.

363
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,675
Your father and l
were mocked for our theories.

364
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,479
Not just in the community at large,
but at Oscorp, as well.

365
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,676
They called us mad scientists.

366
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,035
And then your father
bred the spiders...

367
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,519
...and everything changed.

368
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,272
The results were
beyond encouraging.

369
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,317
They were spectacular.

370
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,238
We were gonna change
the lives of millions.

371
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,277
Including my own.

372
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,273
Then it was over.

373
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,918
He was gone.

374
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,477
Took his research with him.

375
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,988
And I knew without him, l....

376
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,792
I....

377
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,390
I was angry.

378
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,473
So I stayed away from you...

379
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,471
...and your family.

380
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,471
And for that, I'm truly sorry.

381
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,078
Say....

382
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,749
Say it worked.

383
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,990
Say you got it to work.

384
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,268
Like, how much would
the foreign species take over?

385
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,190
What could the side effects be?

386
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,717
It's hard to say,
considering no subject survived.

387
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,434
The problem was always--

388
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,953
The decay rate algorithm?

389
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,239
-Right.
-Right.

390
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,669
Can l...?

391
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,432
Of course.

392
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,314
Extraordinary.

393
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,678
How did you come up with this?

394
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,594
Peter, how about coming
to see me at the Tower...

395
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,591
-...one day after school?
-Yeah.

396
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,392
Thank you.

397
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,150
Number one, Reggie.

398
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,196
Run it, buddy.

399
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,839
Let's go, Reggie.

400
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,836
Rejected!

401
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,038
You did that on purpose, Flash!

402
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,191
I should've.
You better watch your back.

403
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,592
Hey.

404
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,310
All right?

405
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,550
Give it up.

406
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,875
Come on, man.

407
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,675
One sec.

408
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,235
-Come on, man.
-Why don't you take it from me?

409
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,429
That's right. Take it.

410
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,154
Go ahead. Take it.

411
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,076
Just take it.

412
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,430
All right, how about this?

413
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,195
All right?

414
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,236
How about that?

415
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,356
-Come on, Flash.
-Flash, stop playing, man.

416
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,556
-Take it from him!
-Come on, Flash. Take it.

417
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,994
Yo, Flash, let's go.

418
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,593
-Let's go!
-Do it, Flash.

419
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,432
-Stop playing, man.
-Let's go, Flash.

420
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,192
-What are you doing?
-What's up?

421
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,630
What you doing?

422
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,556
All right, bring it!
Come on, Parker! Come on!

423
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,112
Peter's behaviour is just...

424
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,030
...unacceptable.

425
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,030
They won't make us pay...

426
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,919
-...for the backboard.
-I don't care about the backboard.

427
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,718
-Was that true?
-What?

428
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,598
What I heard in there just now.

429
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,593
Did you humiliate that boy?

430
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,555
Yeah, I did.

431
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,635
-But--
-But what?

432
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,199
-This guy deserved it.
-Did he?

433
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,998
-Yeah.
-ls he the kid that hit you?

434
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,434
Is he?

435
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,352
Yeah, yeah, but....

436
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,511
So all this is about getting even.

437
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,356
If so, I guess you must feel pretty good
about yourself now, right?

438
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,475
Am I right or wrong?

439
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,913
Yeah, I thought so.

440
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,750
Well, thanks to this
little escapade of yours...

441
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,797
...I had to change shifts at work...

442
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,475
...so you have to pick up Aunt May
tonight at 9:.00. Understood?

443
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,353
-ls that understood?
-Yeah.

444
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,158
Okay, good.

445
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,469
She looks familiar.

446
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,319
The girl on your computer.

447
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,075
Yeah.

448
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,073
He's got you on his computer.
I'm his probation officer.

449
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,398
Don't forget Aunt May.

450
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,672
Okay.

451
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,037
He's a character.

452
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,155
That's my uncle.

453
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,276
He's a pathological liar.

454
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,759
He thought you were someone else.

455
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,309
Oh, man, you don't have me
on your computer?

456
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,472
I took a photo of the debate team,
and you're in the debate team.

457
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,278
-Right.
-So...

458
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,670
...he must have seen--
I was touching up stuff.

459
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,913
-Touching up stuff?
-Come on.

460
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,630
I was.... I'm not gonna answer that.

461
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,035
-Did you get expelled?
-No, no.

462
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,316
I didn't get expelled.
I got community service.

463
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,318
So you want to-- I don't know...?

464
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,510
Want to what?

465
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,309
I don't know.

466
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,118
Just....

467
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,515
I don't know-- We could....

468
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,351
We could do something else,
or we could--

469
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,875
-lf you don't feel like, we could--
-Yeah.

470
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,519
-Yeah?
-Yeah, either one.

471
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,916
-Really?
-Sure.

472
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,556
Okay.

473
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,994
All right, good. Sounds good.

474
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,070
Cool.

475
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,033
Okay.

476
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,435
-I can't right now, I can't right now.
-Yeah, no.

477
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,670
-I'm so busy right now.
-I know, me too.

478
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,639
But maybe....

479
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,870
-Yeah, just, you know....
-Some other....

480
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,632
-Time, all right.
-Okay.

481
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,392
-Bye.
-All right.

482
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,320
We have protein structure, rDNA...

483
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,471
...chromatography,
transgenics testing...

484
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,757
...that's X-ray video. That's the only
one on the planet. We have....

485
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,589
-Human line testing over--
-I remember that.

486
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,352
I've seen that before.

487
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,748
The Ganali device.

488
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,514
Yeah, I remember a picture of that
in my dad's office.

489
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,069
The idea was so simple.
You load it with an antigen.

490
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,550
It creates a cloud which can be dispersed
over a neighbourhood, even a city.

491
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,951
Theoretically, you could
cure polio in an afternoon.

492
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,039
That's incredible.

493
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,317
Well, others disagreed. What if
the device were loaded with a toxin?

494
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,391
What if you wanted to opt out?
You can't...

495
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,836
...run away from a cloud after all,
so here it lies, gathering dust.

496
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,148
What you see here
is a computer model of a lizard.

497
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,392
Many of these wonderful creatures
have so brilliantly adapted...

498
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,949
...that they can regenerate
entire limbs at will.

499
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,872
You can imagine my envy.

500
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,871
We're trying to harness
this capability...

501
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,190
...and transfer it
into our host subject:

502
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,510
Freddy the three-legged mouse.

503
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,590
Enter the algorithm now.

504
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,596
Need to take that?

505
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,117
System ready...

506
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,793
...for gene insertion.

507
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,518
Okay.

508
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,359
Check.

509
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,309
See what I'm trying to do?

510
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,277
-Preempt the proteins.
-The immune response.

511
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,555
Beginning trials.

512
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,188

Peptide algorithm accepted.

520
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,109
Regrowth complete.

521
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,713
-Hey.
-Vitals normal.

522
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,349
Blood pressure normal.

523
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,269
Limb regeneration successful.

524
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,158
Extraordinary.

525
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,957
And thank you.

526
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,755
Meet Fred and Wilma...

527
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,154
...our three-legged...

528
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,389
...mice.

529
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,349
Here you go.

530
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,712
Hey, buddy, I got you.

531
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,236
Okay.

532
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,391
Careful, don't want to stick you
by mistake.

533
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,357
Human trials aren't until next week.

534
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,996
There.

535
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,748
Hey.

536
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,195
Hey, I thought you....

537
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,191
Didn't you forget something?

538
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,029
What?

539
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,875
Now, don't answer that,
but I'm glad to know it's working.

540
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,634
You owe your aunt
an apology bigtime.

541
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,516
Be a man.

542
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,318
Get in there and apologise.

543
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,079
I'm sorry, Aunt May, l....

544
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,468
Honestly, you don't have...

545
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,153
...to apologise to me. It's your--

546
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,038
-The hell he doesn't.
-Ben.

547
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,677
Look, I'm sorry, I got distracted.

548
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,671
-Oh, he got distracted.
-Yeah.

549
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,832
Your aunt, my wife,
had to walk 12 blocks alone...

550
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,310
...in the middle of the night and then
wait in a deserted subway station...

551
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,674
...because you got distracted.

552
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,432
Ben, sweetheart, honestly...

553
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,556
...I am completely capable
of walking home--

554
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,676
You will not defend this boy!

555
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,068
-I'm not defending--
-You are!

556
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,629
-Listen to me, son.
-Yeah, go ahead.

557
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,279
You're a lot like your father.

558
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,829
You really are, Peter,
and that's a good thing...

559
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,992
...but your father lived by a philosophy,
a principle, really.

560
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,357
He believed that if you could do
good things for other people...

561
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,875
...you had a moral obligation
to do those things.

562
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,553
That's what's at stake here.

563
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,675
Not choice.

564
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,751
Responsibility.

565
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,229
That is nice. That's great.

566
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,236
That's all well and good.
So where is he?

567
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,196
-What?
-Where is he?

568
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,238
Where's my dad?

569
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,756
He didn't think it was his responsibility
to be here to tell me himself?

570
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,194
Oh, come on, how dare you?

571
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,998
How dare l? How dare you?

572
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,395
Where you going?

573
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,278
Peter, come back here, please.

574
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,432
Ben, leave him alone for a little while.
He'll be all right.

575
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,875
Peter!

576
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,919
Peter?

577
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,633
Peter!

578
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,430
It's $2.07.

579
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,749
It's $2.07.

580
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,194
Yeah. No, I know.

581
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,079
Yeah, you're holding up the line. No.

582
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,435
You can leave a penny,
you can't take a penny.

583
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,708
-What?
-You can leave...

584
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,394
...a penny anytime,
you have to spend 10 dollars...

585
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,391
...to take a penny.
It's store policy.

586
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,869
-You're holding up my line.
-I don't have 2 cents.

587
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,632
You can't afford milk, step aside.

588
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,950
Daddy didn't give you
enough milk money today?

589
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,394
We're talking about 2 cents.

590
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,549
Just step aside, kid.

591
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,155
Really?

592
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,318
Yo, not cool, bro.

593
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,035
Hey, man, stop!

594
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,599
Somebody stop that guy!

595
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,079
Hey, kid, little help?

596
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,559
Not my policy.

597
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,109
Somebody stop that dude!

598
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:09,717
Hey!

599
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,108
Hey, stop!

600
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,798
Somebody stop that dude!

601
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:22,950
Hey!

602
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,037
Oh, God, oh, God.

603
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,679
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

604
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,838
Call an ambulance!

605
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,309
Someone call an ambulance!
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

606
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,512
Oh, God, oh, my God.

607
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,678
Oh, God.

608
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,239
No.

609
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,197
Oh, Jesus.

610
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,748
Witnesses gave a description to the
sketch artist. I need you to take a look.

611
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,712
No, I don't know him.

612
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,279
I didn't expect you would, ma'am.
Homicide detectives...

613
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,317
...are on it.
We'll see what they turn up.

614
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,072
Okay.

615
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,753
Can I have that?

616
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,239
Sure.

617
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,357
There's one other thing.
He has a star...

618
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,236
...tattooed...

619
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,594
...on his left hand.

620
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,272
Peter, I know things
have been difficult lately...

621
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,472
...and I'm sorry about that.

622
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,156
I think I know what you're feeling.

623
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,232
Hey, Parker.

624
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,236
-Not today.
-Come on, I just want to talk.

625
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,032
It feels better, right?

626
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,433
Look, your uncle died.

627
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,479
I'm sorry.

628
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,039
I get it.

629
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,919
I'm sorry.

630
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,793
Okay?

631
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,034
Peter.

632
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,869
Stay away from him.

633
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:54,995
-You understand?
-Hey!

634
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,513
-Stay away from Joey.
-Hey!

635
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,908
You like beating on girls?

636
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,559
You like beating on old men?

637
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,357
Hey, pal...

638
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,270
...keep walking.

639
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,749
-You're in the wrong place.
-When were you in Queens?

640
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,509
I asked you a question.

641
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,556
Nicky, no!

642
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,391
That the gun?

643
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,595
You gonna kill me too?

644
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,589
Hey! Stop it!

645
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,356
Hey, get off!

646
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,668
Wait, oh, don't hit Nicky!

647
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,989
Back up!

648
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,678
This guy is crazy!

649
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,475
Get him!

650
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,950
Get back here, man! Get him!

651
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,236
Follow him!

652
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,392
-Go around, man!
-I'll follow you!

653
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,116
Go, go, go!

654
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,549
There he is!

655
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,516
Can't get away!

656
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,232
He has a star tattooed
on his left hand.

657
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,470
Oh, yeah?

658
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,595
Come on!

659
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,199
I know what you look like!

660
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,078
You hear me?

661
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,755
I've seen your face!

662
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,552
Is that all you got?

663
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,593
Just take it, take it.

664
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,439
Engineered from
genetically enhanced spiders...

665
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:32,832
...Oscorp's BioCable tensile strength
is unparalleled. We're just beginning...

666
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,595
... to understand all the potential
industrial applications.

667
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,116
A single pellet can safely store
several hundred metres...

668
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,032
...of the lightweight cable.

669
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,390
Mother....

670
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:51,031
Attention, all units in the confines
of Precinct 13, receiving a 10-30...

671
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,395
...on West 19th Street
and Broadway.

672
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,199
Assailant is Caucasian male,
mid-30s...

673
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,158
... 170 to 180 pounds...

674
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,639
...shoulder-length blond hair.

675
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,314
Last seen on foot
heading eastbound on 19th Street.

676
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,397
Hey.

677
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,789
You got a description?

678
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,109
Well, no, he wears a mask.

679
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:34,835
A mask?

680
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,115
Most of his victims...

681
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,511
...are suspects with serious rap sheets.
They're calling him a vigilante.

682
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,955
Okay, he's not a vigilante,
he's an anarchist.

683
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,634
Help me, somebody! Arrest me!

684
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,869
Get me out of here.

685
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,514
Hey, look!

686
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,077
Spandex. Spandex.

687
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,795
Everything...

688
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:03,790
...spandex.

689
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,190
Extraordinary velocity vector
is a function...

690
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,112
...of both mass and acceleration.

691
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,998
Come on,
you know better than anyone...

692
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,515
...the weight on any pendulum
has no effect on speed.

693
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:16,275
It doesn't affect frequency,
but it's totally a factor in momentum.

694
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,559
Hey, Aunt May.

695
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,958
Yeah. Eggs?

696
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,360
Organic, got it.

697
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,631
In the future,
if you're gonna steal cars...

698
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,677
...don't dress like a car thief, man.

699
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,319
What are you? You a cop?

700
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:38,193
Really? You seriously think I'm a cop?
Cop in a skin-tight red-and-blue suit?

701
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,793
You know, you're....

702
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,873
You've got a mind...

703
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,439
...of the true scholar, sir.

704
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,875
I was going more for the guys
who do the luge.

705
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,469
Good thinking.

706
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,119
Get out the window.

707
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,508
There you go. You got it.

708
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,953
Crotch!

709
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,910
-Just let me go.
-ls that a real knife?

710
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,195
Yes, it's a real knife.

711
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,793
My weakness, it's small knives.

712
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,473
-Just let me go.
-Anything but...

713
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,471
...knives! Oh, it's so simple.

714
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,039
-That was cool.
-What is this?

715
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,668
Webbing I developed.
I don't think you want to know.

716
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,477
Let me go!

717
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,958
Okay, one second.
Hold on, one second.

718
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,189
Knock it off, man. No!

719
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,595
Come on, let me go. Stop it!

720
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,389
That isn't funny.

721
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,959
-lt is kind of funny.
-Help!

722
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,799
This could've gone a lot worse.

723
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,837
Now hold still.

724
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,434
Boys in blue here.

725
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,989
-Yo, I got him.
-Freeze!

726
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,912
-He's not going anywhere.
-Don't move.

727
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,035
You serious?

728
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,315
Who are you?

729
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,358
No one grasps
the concept of the mask.

730
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,270
Freeze!

731
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,673
I just did 80 percent of your job.

732
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:03,916
And that?

733
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:04,956
That's how you repay me?

734
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,555
Hold it right there!

735
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,708
Well, that was fun.

736
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,678
Bus! Hey there, everybody.

737
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:38,549
What are you doing?

738
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,995
Hey, watch out.

739
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,229
I'm swinging here.

740
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,833
I'm swinging here.

741
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,999
So 38 of New York's finest...

742
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,197
...versus one guy in a unitard.

743
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,235
Am I correct?

744
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,159
You don't have to wait up for me.

745
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,548
-Yes, I do.
-No, you don't.

746
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,675
Yes, I do.

747
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,114
-Okay.
-Where were you?

748
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,269
I was out.

749
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,317
Did you get the eggs?

750
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,233
Nope. Forgot the eggs.

751
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,549
I'm gonna get them now.

752
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,233
No, you most certainly will not.

753
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,311
Not at this hour.

754
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,877
Look at me, Peter.

755
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,028
Take off the damn hood
and look at me.

756
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,391
Peter. Where do you go?

757
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:58,959
Who does this to you?

758
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,838
Please go to sleep, Aunt May.

759
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,911
-Please tell me.
-Aunt May, please...

760
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:05,036
...please, please go to sleep.

761
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,112
I can't sleep.
Don't you understand? I can't sleep.

762
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,549
Peter, listen to me.

763
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,389
Secrets have a cost.

764
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,039
They're not for free.

765
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,316
Not now, not ever.

766
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,597
Cross-species genetics
is finally working.

767
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,957
I've used the lizard DNA
to help Freddy regrow that limb.

768
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,633
It's a miracle.

769
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,313
No, it's hard work and promise.

770
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:47,234
-It's a step closer to the primate lab.
-He doesn't have time for every little step.

771
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,276
Little?

772
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,919
I just mean he can't wait.

773
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,672
Well, he'll have to.

774
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,672
Unless he wants to be a lab rat.

775
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:54,670
That's not what...

776
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:55,636
...I'm saying.

777
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,915
So, what are you saying?

778
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,755
You have to start human trials.

779
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,156
Now.

780
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,390
No, I don't, and no, I won't.

781
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,437
-Well, then he's going to die.
-People die.

782
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,511
Even Norman Osborn.

783
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:09,635
We are not finished.

784
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,313
Human trials?

785
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,948
Where are you going
to find the people to volunteer?

786
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,588
As far as anyone's concerned,
it's for a flu shot.

787
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,513
I might think the Veterans Hospital
is a place to start.

788
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,954
You've gotta be kidding me.

789
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,075
I don't think I am.

790
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,475
It's a little late for
shock and indignation.

791
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:32,709
About 15 years late.

792
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,672
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

793
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,273
Richard Parker wore it well.

794
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:39,159
On you, it's a cheap suit,
as it was then.

795
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,719
I had nothing to do with that.

796
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,359
Is that what you told his son?

797
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,028
I don't know what you're saying.

798
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,634
You don't know,
or you don't wanna know?

799
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,312
I'll remind you what happened.

800
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,790
Richard Parker said just about the same
thing then that you are saying now.

801
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:04,117
The clock is ticking, Dr. Connors.

802
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,752
I....

803
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,638
I won't.

804
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,318
Fine.

805
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,314
The formula is ours now anyway.

806
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:30,113
Say goodbye to that arm
you have dreamed of.

807
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,759
I'm shutting you down.

808
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,718
Have your office cleared out
by the morning.

809
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,236
Your toys can be taken away too,
you know.

810
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,315
Right, Freddy?

811
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:56,909
-Hey.
-Hi.

812
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:57,830
How's it going?

813
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,149
Where you headed?

814
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,554
-Monday, B track.
-Oh, it's Thursday.

815
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,598
-It's Thursday?
-What happened?

816
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,352
-What?
-Your eye, it looks bruised.

817
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,714
Oh, yeah, no, I don't....

818
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,438
Maybe I got a rash or....

819
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,318
It's bad.
Have you gone to the nurse?

820
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,118
Do you like branzino?

821
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,394
Like, a fish.

822
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,312
No, no. I know. I know.

823
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,596
Well, if you want...

824
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:26,072
...you can come to this address
at 8:00 tonight.

825
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,432
My mom's making branzino.

826
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,273
So....

827
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,276
It's apartment...

828
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,670
...2016. I didn't write that part down.

829
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,114
I don't know why l....

830
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,032
-I'll remember it.
-Oh, okay.

831
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,519
2016.

832
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,074
Hi.

833
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,554
How did you get out there?

834
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,879
The fire escape.

835
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,433
Your doorman's intimidating.

836
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:54,878
It's 20 storeys.

837
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:56,593
Yeah. It's all right.

838
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,511
-This is your room.
-Yes, this is my room.

839
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:04,272
Books.

840
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,879
Shoes.

841
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,913
Oh, hey....

842
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,239
I got your mom...

843
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,719
...these.

844
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:12,915
Oh, lovely.

845
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,672
-Beautiful, right?
-Beautiful.

846
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,159
They were nice.

847
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,038
-No, they're beautiful.
-I'm sorry.

848
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,839
No, it's impressive.
They actually held together very well.

849
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,479
I'm gonna keep these.

850
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,599
You have your suit in there?

851
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,112
My suit?

852
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,555
It's for dinner. Are you gonna--?

853
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:32,789
Are you gonna wear that?

854
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:33,915
-That's--
-Hey, hon.

855
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,196
You must be Peter.

856
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,112
Dad, this is Peter.

857
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:45,829
Nice to meet you, sir.

858
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,069
Nice to meet you.

859
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,753
Dinner's ready.

860
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:51,794
Hope you like branzino.

861
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:53,439
Who doesn't?

862
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:51,794
Emma, it's Curt.

863
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,636
-ls he there?
-I'm afraid not, doctor.

864
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,519
The car is taking him
to the Veterans Hospital in Brooklyn.

865
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:58,829
No. He can't, Emma.

866
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,195
You have to stop him. He--

867
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:03,669
I would, but I always lose him
on the bridge.

868
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,673
I'll make sure Dr. Ratha returns
your call as soon as possible.

869
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:19,477
I'm going to Holton Avenue,
across the river. I'm in a hurry.

870
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:21,596
You want me to take
the tunnel or the bridge?

871
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:22,954
Bridge! Take the bridge.

872
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,394
All right, we'll do that.

873
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:25,595
Hey, you all right...

874
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,476
...back there?

875
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:27,997
You tweaking...

876
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,309
...man?

877
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,958
Just drive.

878
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,669
Okay.

879
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,113
You're having trouble there?

880
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,872
The head goes on the other--

881
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,519
Help Gwen's friend with his fish.

882
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:45,829
Oh, l....

883
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,035
I got no idea.

884
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,679
First time.

885
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:50,353
-Branzino.
-George.

886
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:53,159
-Tell us about your day.
-Did you catch that spider guy yet?

887
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,833
No, we didn't catch him yet.

888
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,797
But we will. He's an amateur...

889
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,554
...who's assaulting civilians
in the dead of night.

890
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:01,517
He's clumsy, he leaves clues...

891
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:02,999
...but he's still dangerous.

892
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,239
He's assaulting people?

893
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:07,955
I'm not sure.

894
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,519
I mean, I saw that video...

895
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,557
...with him and the car thief, and....

896
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:14,712
I think most people
would say that he was...

897
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,759
...providing a public service.

898
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,317
Most people would be wrong.

899
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:23,870
If I wanted the car thief off the street,
he'd already be off the street.

900
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:25,234
So why wasn't he then?

901
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,069
Let me illuminate you.

902
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,754
The car thief was leading us
to the people who run...

903
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:35,036
...the operation.
It's a six-month-long sting.

904
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,078
It's called strategy.
I'm sure you're aware of the term?

905
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,629
-You've heard about that in school?
-Yeah.

906
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:41,630
Good.

907
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:42,994
I know.

908
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:45,720
-He didn't know you had a plan.
-You seem to know...

909
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,552
...a lot about this.
Know something we don't?

910
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,915
-Whose side are you on?
-I'm not on anyone's side.

911
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,399
I saw a video on the lnternet--

912
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:53,039
You saw the video on the lnternet.

913
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,316
-Well, then the case is closed.
-Well, no.

914
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:56,390
If you watch the video--

915
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:57,959
Maybe send you a link?

916
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,712
It looks like he's trying to help.

917
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:02,633
On the lnternet he's being made out
to look like a hero.

918
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,437
No, no.

919
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:05,238
I'm not saying he's a hero.

920
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,630
-What are you trying to say?
-He's trying to help.

921
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,074
He's trying to do something
the police can't.

922
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:10,559
Something the police can't?

923
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,199
-I don't know.
-What do you think we do?

924
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:13,839
Sit around eating doughnuts...

925
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,718
...with our thumbs
planted up our asses?

926
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,836
-George. George.
-Daddy.

927
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:18,711
-Up your what?
-Howard.

928
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,632
He stands for what you stand for.

929
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,279
Protecting innocent people
from bad guys.

930
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,431
I stand for law and order.
That's what I stand for.

931
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,113
Okay? I wear a badge.

932
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:29,192
This guy wears a mask
like an outlaw.

933
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,794
He's hunting down criminals
that all look the same...

934
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:34,030
...Iike he's got some sort
of personal vendetta.

935
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:37,078
But he's not protecting
innocent people, Mr. Parker.

936
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,992
Let's get some air, Peter.

937
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,670
-Dad, we need to talk.
-Yes, we do.

938
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,712
Thank you for having me. I'm sorry...

939
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:48,030
...if I insulted you.
It was not my intention.

940
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:51,391
-You're welcome.
-Branzino was real good, Mrs. Stacy.

941
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:53,551
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

942
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,634
-Dad.
-Yeah?

943
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,951
Well, that was something.

944
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:10,318
I'm sorry. I thought he was
going to arrest me at one point.

945
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,994
No, I wouldn't
have let him arrest you.

946
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:20,154
-What happened to your face?
-I wanna tell you something.

947
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,154
Okay.

948
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,308
I've been bitten....

949
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:34,316
So have l.

950
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:40,913
Okay.

951
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:44,749
Okay, okay, okay.
I gotta tell you this one thing.

952
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,592
I gotta tell you this thing about...

953
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:49,479
-...the vigilante and the car thief.
-Oh, okay.

954
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,232
What?

955
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,550
-No, no, no.
-I don't want to talk about that.

956
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,312
Forget that.
I won't talk about that.

957
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,630
-I'm gonna talk about me, okay?
-What about you?

958
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:01,475
It's impo-- I wish I could just--

959
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:02,834
I can't. It's hard to say.

960
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:03,955
Just say it.

961
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:06,156
-I don't know.
-Say it.

962
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,108
What? What?

963
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,078
What?

964
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,757
Okay, then forget it.

965
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:29,959
You...?

966
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,276
-You're Spider-Man.
-Shut up.

967
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,513
Gwen?

968
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:48,994
Gwen....

969
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,831
Your father wants you to come inside.

970
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:53,389
Okay.

971
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:54,515
-Okay?
-Yeah.

972
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,189
Gwen.

973
01:08:58,360 --> 01:08:59,952
I'm coming.

974
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:31,920
Oh, I'm in trouble.

975
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,270
Will you please...

976
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,237
...find out what is going on, Alfred?

977
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,196
Excellent.

978
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,310
Hey!

979
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,274
Hey! What is that?

980
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,237
-Oh, my God!
-I don't know!

981
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,753
Get back in the car!

982
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:22,959
Help!

983
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:25,430
Help!

984
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,036
Incoming!

985
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:26,831
Somebody help!

986
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,232
Help me! My kid is trapped!

987
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:39,715
I want my dad!

988
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,029
Dad!

989
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,519
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Help!

990
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:43,317
Hey, buddy.

991
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:44,595
-It's okay.
-Get away.

992
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:46,589
-Help!
-Hey, look.

993
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,877
Just a normal guy, all right?

994
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,350
Wanna hold this?

995
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:54,750
Hold my mask.

996
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,236
All right.

997
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,119
What's your name?

998
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,030
Jack?

999
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,512
-Yes.
-Let's get you out of here.

1000
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,512
Okay, stay very still.

1001
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:06,476
All right.

1002
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:07,834
Okay, I got you.

1003
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:12,717
Okay, look.

1004
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,438
I'll undo the belt. You hold on...

1005
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,556
...to that seat in front of you.
On three?

1006
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,360
-All right.
-Okay, one, two, three.

1007
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,476
See how easy that was?
You did a great job.

1008
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,278
All right, okay.

1009
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:39,634
Jack, climb now.

1010
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,358
-I can't.
-Yes, you can.

1011
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,431
Put it on, the mask.

1012
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,953
It's gonna make you strong.

1013
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:51,794
Jack, trust me.

1014
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:52,870
Put it on.

1015
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:56,154
There you go. That's it.
That's it, buddy.

1016
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:57,389
Okay, now, climb.

1017
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:58,515
Come on, Jack.

1018
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:02,757
Do me a favour.

1019
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,353
A little faster, okay, bud?

1020
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,830
You're doing great, buddy.
You're doing great.

1021
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,035
That's it. Keep coming.

1022
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,553
Keep it coming.

1023
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:10,709
Keep coming.

1024
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:12,874
No!

1025
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,558
Jack. Oh, God.

1026
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:30,153
Thank God.

1027
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,074
You okay?

1028
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,399
My son. My son.

1029
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:39,269
Oh, my son.

1030
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,112
My son.

1031
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,429
Who are you?

1032
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,193
Spider-Man.

1033
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,237
Beautiful.

1034
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,069
Settle down, guys.

1035
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,598
Settle down, boys. Settle down.

1036
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,830
-Come on.
-Listen. At approximately...

1037
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,310
...9 p.m. Iast night, an incident
took place on the Williamsburg Bridge.

1038
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,592
Much of what occurred
is speculation...

1039
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:59,433
...at this point.
However, several eyewitnesses...

1040
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,876
... to the crime, as well as
our own preliminary findings, have...

1041
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,109
...positively placed...

1042
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:05,872
... one individual at the scene.

1043
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:07,439
Which is why, this morning...

1044
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:08,953
...I am issuing a warrant...

1045
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:12,317
... for the masked vigilante
known as Spider-Man.

1046
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,549
And lastly, city council members met
with homeowners and airport officials...

1047
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:23,312
... in the first of four meetings....

1048
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:31,639
It's so beautiful.

1049
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,552
Knows how to bite though.

1050
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:35,392
Who else knows about this?

1051
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:36,390
Just you.

1052
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:37,754
Really?

1053
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:41,951
Hey, you don't....

1054
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:45,148
You don't believe what the police
are saying, do you?

1055
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,433
Of course not.

1056
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:50,674
Does it scare you?

1057
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:52,592
What you can do?

1058
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,274
No.

1059
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,395
No.

1060
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:01,351
What did that thing
on the bridge look like?

1061
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:04,235
It was real big.
Too big to be human.

1062
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,079
You gotta lay low.

1063
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:08,159
No, can't do that.

1064
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:09,839
You've got to.

1065
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,073
I mean, why...?

1066
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,755
Because of last night.

1067
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,831
Those people on the bridge.

1068
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,834
Whatever was attacking them
would have killed them.

1069
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:23,077
So...

1070
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:24,832
...I gotta go after it.

1071
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:27,269
That's not your job.

1072
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,153
Maybe it is.

1073
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,359
I really liked kissing you.

1074
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,313
You're an amazing kisser.

1075
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,115
Well, you know, it was--

1076
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,191
It was good for me too.

1077
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:50,318
Yeah?

1078
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:00,429
Who did that?

1079
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,235
Hello!

1080
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,596
It's not nice to snoop.

1081
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,197
I gave everyone the week off.

1082
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:40,997
Yeah.

1083
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:43,474
Shouldn't you be at school?

1084
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:47,116
No, I got a free track.

1085
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,191
I wanted to ask you a question.

1086
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:50,869
How would a predator...

1087
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,268
...track a reptile?

1088
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:55,159
Oh, they don't.
Most reptiles are at the top...

1089
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:56,514
...of their food chain.

1090
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:58,113
Kings of their domain.

1091
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,713
They gotta have vulnerabilities.

1092
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,348
Why the sudden interest
in the cold-blooded?

1093
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:06,948
Just asking a question.

1094
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:09,839
I got school stuff.

1095
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,911
Biology profiles to do.

1096
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,470
So because of the cold blood...

1097
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,471
...would they react to changes
in temperatures?

1098
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:17,959
You'd have to catch one first.

1099
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:21,991
Did you know there's a rumour
of a new species in New York?

1100
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:23,593
Beautiful and quite large.

1101
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:26,597
What do you know about it?
You seen it?

1102
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:28,671
No, it's not yet classified.

1103
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,431
But it can be aggressive...

1104
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,190
...if threatened.

1105
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:43,834
Doc, you all right?

1106
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,514
Never been better, Peter.
Never been better.

1107
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,159
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1108
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,959
Afraid I have to ask you to leave.
I have a new project...

1109
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,429
...I'm working on.
I need to be alone.

1110
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:56,235
Good. Good, good.

1111
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,512
Good.

1112
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:01,878
Don't worry, Mr. Parker.
I'll be back.

1113
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,876
Wonderful things are coming.

1114
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,798
Wonderful things.

1115
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:22,988
Fred?

1116
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,716
Mr. Mayor,
if there was a giant dinosaur...

1117
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:32,269
...running around
you would be the first to know.

1118
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:34,874
So tell your son
he can rest easy, all right?

1119
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,996
Yeah. You and me both, sir.

1120
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:39,276
Okay. Bye-bye.

1121
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,237
Mr. Parker, why are you...

1122
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:43,152
-...not in school?
-Got a free track.

1123
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,514
Okay, well, I do not.

1124
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:45,874
So make your point quickly.

1125
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:48,315
Fine, there may not be a dinosaur
running around.

1126
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,675
There is something more dangerous,
and I know who.

1127
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:52,353
-You know who?
-Dr. Curtis Connors.

1128
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:53,839
-He's a biochemist.
-Of Oscorp?

1129
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,433
-That's right.
-Dr. Connors...

1130
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,511
...who's my daughter's mentor.
Is that who?

1131
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:58,829
-That's the one.
-Okay.

1132
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,151
Recently, Dr. Connors gave Gwen
a college recommendation.

1133
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,276
It was beautiful.
When I read it, I cried.

1134
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:06,510
You would have me believe
that he...

1135
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,796
...is running around dressed up
like a dinosaur?

1136
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,475
Not dressing up and not a dinosaur.
He has transformed himself into a lizard.

1137
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,079
Let me ask you a question.

1138
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:20,232
Do I look like the mayor
of Tokyo to you?

1139
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,755
I'm telling you the absolute truth.

1140
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:25,832
This man has worked for his whole life
on cross-species genetics.

1141
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,390
He lost an arm, he tried to grow it back,
but the equation was imbalanced.

1142
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,915
He has turned into a lizard.
He's using lizard DNA.

1143
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:35,629
He is dangerous, and he is planning
something horrific. I know. I know.

1144
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:38,155
Okay. All right, I get it.

1145
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:39,989
Here's what we'll do.

1146
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:43,119
You'll go back to hanging out
with the citizens of Tokyo.

1147
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:45,396
I'm gonna go back
to protecting the citizens...

1148
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:47,516
...of this fine, fair city of ours.

1149
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:49,830
Sergeant Butler,
please escort Mr. Parker...

1150
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,833
-...back to school.
-Captain Stacy, I'm not messing around.

1151
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,912
Just bring him in. Just call him in.
You have to call him in.

1152
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,638
He is a danger to everybody.

1153
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:59,950
-Just, please, listen to me.
-Let's go.

1154
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:05,394
Jimmy.

1155
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,313
Get me everything we have
on Dr. Curtis Connors.

1156
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:11,960
-Okay? Right away.
-Yeah.

1157
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:38,157
Subject: Dr. Curtis Connors.

1158
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,799
Current temperature: 89.7.

1159
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:41,359
Steady for 48 hours.

1160
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,909
Blood panels reveal
lymphocyte and monocyte readings...

1161
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,672
...consistent with subject's past.

1162
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:52,792
Clotting rate vastly improved.

1163
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:54,393
Marked enhancement...

1164
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:55,834
...in muscle response...

1165
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,319
...strength and elasticity.

1166
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:06,831
Eyesight similarly improved.

1167
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,389
Subject no longer requires
corrective lenses.

1168
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,351
This is no longer about curing ills.

1169
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,199
This is about...

1170
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:19,395
...finding perfection.

1171
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:30,271
In attempt to redress
regenerative relapse...

1172
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:34,035
...dosage has been increased
to 200 milligrams.

1173
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:06,632
You stopped me once.

1174
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:09,710
You won't stop me again.

1175
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:14,518
I'm getting stronger every day!

1176
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:53,159
Oh, that sucked.

1177
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:05,712
Peter Parker.

1178
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:24,159
Come in.

1179
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:27,794
You should maybe...

1180
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:29,712
...consider coming in
through the lobby.

1181
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:34,192
Also, my father is under
the impression...

1182
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:37,079
-...that you require psychiatric attention.
-Oh, really?

1183
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:38,833
Peter.

1184
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:40,315
What happened?

1185
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,754
You should see the other guy.

1186
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:47,752
The other guy, in this instance,
being a giant mutant lizard.

1187
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:48,875
Hey, Gwen, honey.

1188
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:49,916
Do you want cocoa?

1189
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:51,149
Howard's making some.

1190
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:56,913
No, Dad, I do not want cocoa.

1191
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:58,672
Honestly, I'm 17 years old.

1192
01:25:58,840 --> 01:25:59,636
Okay.

1193
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:03,679
I remembered somebody saying her
fantasy was to live in a chocolate house.

1194
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:05,239
Well, that's impractical.

1195
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:06,753
And fattening.

1196
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:10,915
Chocolate house.

1197
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:15,398
-Sorry, Dad.
-It's good.

1198
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:18,233
I can't have cocoa right now
because I'm work--

1199
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:21,358
I'm doing this....

1200
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:23,078
I have cramps.

1201
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,876
I feel kind of pukey and just sort of....

1202
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:28,235
-Like, emotional. I keep crying.
-It's okay. Good.

1203
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:30,038
-Good.
-It's brutal.

1204
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,154
You don't want to know.

1205
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,435
-It's, like, bad.
-Got it.

1206
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,477
-Thanks, Daddy.
-All right.

1207
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:01,869
Easy, Bug Boy.

1208
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:03,953
What'd you call me?

1209
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:10,592
I'm going to be all right.

1210
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:13,354
-No. No.
-Yes. Yes.

1211
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:17,069
I know what this is.

1212
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:18,514
What is it?

1213
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:22,432
Every day, for as long
as I can remember, my father...

1214
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:23,999
...has left every morning...

1215
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,720
...and he's put a badge on his chest...

1216
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:29,075
...and strapped a gun to his hip.

1217
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:33,915
And every day,
for as long as I can remember...

1218
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:36,435
...I haven't known if he was
gonna make it home.

1219
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,352
I got you.

1220
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:49,675
Okay?

1221
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:53,235
Okay?

1222
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:56,751
I gotta stop him, though.

1223
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:00,198
I have to, because I created him.

1224
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:04,759
What do you mean?

1225
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:08,111
I gave him an equation...

1226
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,596
...that made all of this possible.

1227
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,673
Something my father
had been working on, you know.

1228
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:25,718
Secretly. Now I realise
why he kept it a secret.

1229
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,755
Point is, this is my responsibility.

1230
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:36,030
I have to fix it.

1231
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,592
Peter.

1232
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,238
Hey.

1233
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,436
Let's get out of here.

1234
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:50,318
Let's just get out of here.

1235
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:52,118
Just for a minute. Can we?

1236
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,677
-No. No.
-Yeah. Yes.

1237
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:55,955
-Yes.
-No.

1238
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:57,235
Yes.

1239
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:59,789
If my parents see me leaving,
I'm dead.

1240
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:06,191
Your parents aren't
gonna see you leaving.

1241
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,558
Peter Parker.

1242
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:22,312
Spider-Man.

1243
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:24,352
I'm not the one who needs...

1244
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:25,748
...help.

1245
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:27,552
There will be no more loneliness...

1246
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:29,119
...no more outcasts.

1247
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:32,875
Species-wide distribution
could enhance...

1248
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:35,315
...humanity on an evolutionary scale.

1249
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:37,990
One has to adapt to survive.

1250
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,839
"That, changing like the snake,
I might be free...

1251
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,470
...to cast off flesh
wherein I dwell confined."

1252
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:50,677
Would you give it all up
after all you know...

1253
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:51,750
...you can do?

1254
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:54,434
All the power you feel.

1255
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:58,994
I can save...

1256
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:00,036
... them!

1257
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:07,435
You won't get in...

1258
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:08,715
... the way of my plan...

1259
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:10,438
...Peter Parker!

1260
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:36,954
Go. Go!

1261
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:13,751
Nowhere to hide, Peter.

1262
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:31,555
All these souls...

1263
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:32,914
...Iost and alone.

1264
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:33,910
I can save them.

1265
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:35,638
I can cure them.

1266
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:37,313
There's no need to stop me...

1267
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:38,356
...Peter.

1268
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:49,511
You're not thinking straight, doc.

1269
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:54,638
Stop this. This isn't you.

1270
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:00,510
Let's talk this out.

1271
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:02,316
Doc!

1272
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:09,149
Oh, boy.

1273
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:15,509
You don't want to talk?

1274
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:17,799
There you go.

1275
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:22,429
Don't...

1276
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:24,713
...make me...

1277
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:25,835
...have to...

1278
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:27,230
...hurt you!

1279
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,074
That is disgusting.

1280
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:47,039
Gwen.

1281
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,116
-I'm gonna throw you out the window.
-What?

1282
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:25,789
Somebody's been...

1283
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:27,552
...a bad lizard.

1284
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:14,511
This is Lieutenant Williams
from the New York City...

1285
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:17,990
...Police Department.
We've got this building surrounded.

1286
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:28,711
Alpha, let's move ahead. Go!

1287
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,108
-Hey.
-Where are you?

1288
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:42,156
I'm fine. I'm okay.

1289
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:45,551
I'm in the sewer, tracking him. I gotta
stop him before anyone gets hurt.

1290
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:46,789
But we need an antidote.

1291
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:49,428
-Do you know how to run a serum?
-I do it all the time.

1292
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,909
Okay, great.
Okay, I need you to go to Oscorp.

1293
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:54,958
I need you to access the
cross-species file. It's a blue serum.

1294
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:57,156
File 1 2389.

1295
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:58,355
Okay, got it.

1296
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:00,192
On my way.

1297
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:33,870
I spent my life as a scientist trying
to create a world without weakness...

1298
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:36,110
... without outcasts.

1299
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:38,714
I sought to create
a stronger human being...

1300
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:40,711
...but there's no such thing.

1301
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:43,997
Human beings are weak,
pathetic, feeble-minded...

1302
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:45,752
... creatures.

1303
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,319
Why be human at all...

1304
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:48,674
... when we can be so...

1305
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:49,636
...much more?

1306
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:51,995
Faster. Stronger.

1307
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:53,513
Smarter.

1308
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:56,399
This is my gift to you.

1309
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:06,152
Oscorp.

1310
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:09,389
-Captain Stacy!
-What?

1311
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:11,915
We have a confirmed sighting, sir.
The Lizard's headed...

1312
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:14,196
-...toward Canal Street.
-What about Spider-Man?

1313
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:15,509
Inside the high school.

1314
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:17,511
I want that Spider-Man off the street.

1315
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:02,513
The lizard creature
has released a biological agent.

1316
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:04,398
All efforts to stop him have failed...

1317
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:07,632
...and he is now proceeding
north on 7th Avenue. Over.

1318
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:12,310
-Hi.
-Where are you?

1319
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:13,708
Peter, hi. I'm at Oscorp.

1320
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:15,552
You have to get out of there now.

1321
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:17,995
-The antidote is cooking.
-No, no, no.

1322
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:20,515
Connors is on the way.
He's coming to you right now.

1323
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:23,114
He needs the device.
He's gonna infect the whole city!

1324
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:24,395
Eight minutes left.

1325
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:26,994
You're gonna wait eight minutes
after what I told you?

1326
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:28,434
You leave right now.

1327
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:29,589
That is an order, okay?

1328
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,795
I'll get everybody out.

1329
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:32,393
Did you hear wh--?

1330
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:35,472
Gwen! Gwen! You Mother Hubbard.
Are you serious?

1331
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:52,435
He's heading south.

1332
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:04,671
Stand down now, or we will open fire.

1333
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:06,512
You are surrounded. There is...

1334
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:07,954
...no escape.

1335
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:09,753
Go, go!

1336
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:10,479
Clear!

1337
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:11,709
Clear up top!

1338
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:14,674
Clear, sir!

1339
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:15,955
All clear here, sir!

1340
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:41,879
Freeze!

1341
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:43,635
Down on the ground.

1342
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:45,199
Your hands behind your head.

1343
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:46,918
Now!

1344
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:51,559
Parker.

1345
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:54,315
It's headed to Oscorp!

1346
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,755
And your daughter's there right now.

1347
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,228
You gotta let me go.

1348
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:24,956
Hold your fire!

1349
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:34,149
Well, Paul, if I didn't see it,
I wouldn't believe it.

1350
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:36,629
I won't venture to say
what it is crawling up...

1351
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:38,631
...the north side
of the Oscorp Tower...

1352
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:41,917
...but clearly it is not human
and it is very, very strong.

1353
01:41:57,560 --> 01:41:59,471
Time remaining: one minute.

1354
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:11,431
Antidote complete.

1355
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:25,398
Oh, man.

1356
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:28,120
We're getting the latest details.
This is just coming in.

1357
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:29,872
The New York Police Department...

1358
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:31,951
...has called for
a city-wide evacuation...

1359
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:33,997
...everything south of 54th Street.

1360
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,518
If you are south of 54th Street...

1361
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:39,035
...you have to move out
of the area immediately.

1362
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:50,588
Spider-Man appears
to be heading towards Oscorp.

1363
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:51,749
He looks injured...

1364
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:54,480
...and it's really not clear
if he's gonna make it.

1365
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:55,675
That's the guy who...

1366
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:57,159
...saved my boy on the bridge.

1367
01:43:57,320 --> 01:43:58,639
Troy, they're clearing us out.

1368
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:01,109
Something bad's
going down in Midtown.

1369
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:03,748
Still friends with Matthews,
that crane operator on 6th?

1370
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:05,751
-Yeah.
-Get him on the phone for me.

1371
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:07,911
The cops are evacuating everybody.

1372
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:10,196
Get him on the phone for me.

1373
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:29,594
Hey, Charlie, get me Enriquez
on 54th Street!

1374
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:31,751
-You got it.
-Angelo, get your mug over here.

1375
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:34,150
Wolski! You're getting some overtime!

1376
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:37,357
All tower cranes on 6th...

1377
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:41,069
...swing your jib arms over the avenue.
Boom angles at 90 degrees.

1378
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:43,470
Spider-Man needs those big boys
high and lined up.

1379
01:44:43,640 --> 01:44:45,596
Let's give him a clear approach. Over.

1380
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:19,552
Come on, Parker.

1381
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:11,231
Hey.

1382
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:12,555
Dad!

1383
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:14,790
-I have to get this to Spider-Man.
-Get in.

1384
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:16,712
-lt can stop the Lizard.
-Get in the car.

1385
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:19,633
-You don't understand!
-Yes, I do.

1386
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:21,950
Your boyfriend
is a man of many masks.

1387
01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:23,235
I get it.

1388
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:24,435
Give me this.

1389
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:26,352
Get in the car.

1390
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:31,791
Please make sure he's okay.

1391
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:46,678
Initialising Ganali device.

1392
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:49,718
Detonation in T-minus two minutes.

1393
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:11,074
Poor Peter Parker.

1394
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:15,789
No mother, no father...

1395
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:18,552
...no uncle.

1396
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:21,477
All alone.

1397
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:23,635
He's not alone.

1398
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:44,388
Detonation in T-minus 45 seconds.

1399
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:53,670
Hey!

1400
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:54,556
Gift from Gwen.

1401
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:58,359
I got this, Peter! Go!

1402
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:05,712
T-minus...

1403
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:06,995
...30 seconds.

1404
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:25,439
Detonation in T-minus...

1405
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:27,238
... 10 seconds.

1406
01:50:27,680 --> 01:50:28,635
Nine.

1407
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:31,279
Eight.

1408
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:32,759
Seven.

1409
01:50:33,240 --> 01:50:34,468
Six.

1410
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:36,468
Five.

1411
01:50:37,160 --> 01:50:37,831
Four.

1412
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:39,715
Three.

1413
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:42,037
Two.

1414
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:44,357
One.

1415
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:10,672
No.

1416
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:14,031
No!

1417
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:23,269
The captain.

1418
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:26,193
Captain!

1419
01:52:28,760 --> 01:52:30,113
The Lizard.

1420
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:30,951
It's okay.

1421
01:52:31,120 --> 01:52:32,269
We stopped him.

1422
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:33,750
Okay.

1423
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:35,990
Let's get you out of here.
Come on.

1424
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:38,554
Okay, okay, okay.

1425
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:40,119
Look at me. Stay with me.

1426
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:42,271
-Help's on the way, okay?
-You need to....

1427
01:52:42,440 --> 01:52:45,796
You need to be gone
when they get here.

1428
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:47,234
Okay?

1429
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:48,628
I'm not going anywhere.

1430
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:51,509
I was wrong about you, Peter.

1431
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:53,679
This city needs you.

1432
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:57,113
Here.

1433
01:52:57,280 --> 01:52:58,395
You're gonna need this.

1434
01:53:02,640 --> 01:53:04,517
You're gonna make enemies.

1435
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:08,592
People will get hurt.

1436
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:11,951
Sometimes the people closest to you.

1437
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:17,631
So I want you to promise me
something, okay?

1438
01:53:19,480 --> 01:53:23,109
Leave Gwen out of it.

1439
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:27,118
Promise me that.

1440
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:34,112
You promise me.

1441
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:45,994
An eerie calm...

1442
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:48,116
...has set in over New York City.

1443
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:49,508
Apparently, some sort of...

1444
01:54:49,680 --> 01:54:52,558
...aerosolised antidote
was launched from...

1445
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:55,792
...Oscorp Tower, which seems to have
counteracted the biotoxins.

1446
01:54:55,960 --> 01:54:58,793
Residents of Lower Manhattan
can rest peacefully...

1447
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:00,871
...knowing that
the alleged mastermind...

1448
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:04,510
... of this terror plot,
Dr. Curtis Connors, is behind bars.

1449
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:05,999
We've got John Niles...

1450
01:55:06,160 --> 01:55:08,469
... on the street for a report
in Lower Manhattan.

1451
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:10,596
John, what do you see?

1452
01:55:42,120 --> 01:55:44,076
Sweetheart, it's all right.

1453
01:55:46,160 --> 01:55:47,957
It's all right.

1454
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,353
It's all right.

1455
01:55:50,840 --> 01:55:51,750
Rough night.

1456
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:55,352
It's gonna be all right.
