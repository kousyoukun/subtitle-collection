1
00:01:01,403 --> 00:01:04,323
Five, four, three...

2
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:07,117
...two, one.

3
00:01:07,284 --> 00:01:08,744
Ready or not, here I come.

4
00:02:23,861 --> 00:02:25,446
Hey, Dad?

5
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:28,657
Dad!

6
00:03:31,887 --> 00:03:33,013
<i>You'll stay with Aunt May...</i>

7
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,974
...and Uncle Ben for a little while.

8
00:03:35,265 --> 00:03:37,309
- I wanna go with you.
- No.

9
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,816
Doesn't like crust
on his sandwiches...

10
00:03:43,983 --> 00:03:46,235
...and he likes to sleep
with a little light on.

11
00:03:46,402 --> 00:03:48,529
- Mary. Come on, come on.
- Oh, God.

12
00:03:52,783 --> 00:03:54,243
Dad.

13
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:56,787
Be good.

14
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:15,389
Sorry.

15
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:17,391
Morning, Flash.

16
00:04:20,352 --> 00:04:22,438
Good morning, Parker.

17
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,779
Hey. It's Peter, right?

18
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:34,033
I really like your photos.

19
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,826
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

20
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:36,952
Listen...

21
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:38,454
...are you busy Friday night?

22
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:46,962
Cool. Can you take pictures
of my boyfriend's car?

23
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:49,131
You know, I really wanna frame
a good one...

24
00:04:49,298 --> 00:04:50,382
...for his birthday.

25
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:53,636
That's really nice of you.
Wow, that's such a nice thought.

26
00:04:54,219 --> 00:04:56,138
Yeah, I'll have a look at the old...

27
00:04:56,305 --> 00:04:58,057
- The old schedule.
- Okay.

28
00:04:59,224 --> 00:05:00,351
Parker.

29
00:05:00,476 --> 00:05:02,561
- Yes, sir?
- You want to keep that skateboard?

30
00:05:02,728 --> 00:05:04,229
- Yeah.
- Keep it off the ground.

31
00:05:04,396 --> 00:05:05,731
- Sure. Yeah.
- Wheels up.

32
00:05:05,898 --> 00:05:07,024
Like that?

33
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:08,901
- That's it.
- Okay.

34
00:05:35,094 --> 00:05:36,428
<i>Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!</i>

35
00:05:36,595 --> 00:05:37,972
<i>Eat it! Eat it!</i>

36
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:40,683
<i>Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!</i>

37
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:43,268
Eat your vegetables, Gordon.
Come on!

38
00:05:43,435 --> 00:05:44,895
Come on!

39
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:46,230
Hey, Parker, come on.

40
00:05:46,397 --> 00:05:47,773
Get a picture of this.

41
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,110
No, I'm not gonna take a picture of it.
Put him down, man.

42
00:05:51,276 --> 00:05:53,237
- Come on.
- Gordon, don't eat it.

43
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:54,446
Take the picture.

44
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:56,073
Put him down, Flash.

45
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,825
Take the picture.

46
00:05:57,992 --> 00:06:00,577
Put him down, Eugene!

47
00:06:03,622 --> 00:06:04,957
Hey, man.

48
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:07,459
Come on!

49
00:06:07,626 --> 00:06:08,293
Get up, Parker!

50
00:06:11,046 --> 00:06:11,714
Get up!

51
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,507
Come on! Come on!

52
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:14,341
Get up!

53
00:06:17,303 --> 00:06:18,637
Still not taking the picture.

54
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:20,472
Stay down, Parker!

55
00:06:20,973 --> 00:06:22,474
Who wants one more?

56
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:24,226
- One more!
- Flash!

57
00:06:24,727 --> 00:06:26,103
Flash...

58
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,147
...we still on for after school today?

59
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:29,440
My house, 3:30?

60
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:30,816
I hope you did homework.

61
00:06:30,983 --> 00:06:32,484
Last time, I was...

62
00:06:33,068 --> 00:06:34,278
...disappointed in you.

63
00:06:34,445 --> 00:06:36,530
- Okay, move.
- No, how about we go to class?

64
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:37,906
How about it?

65
00:06:40,743 --> 00:06:42,286
Whatever.

66
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:09,271
I thought that was great
what you did.

67
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:11,273
It was stupid...

68
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:13,025
...but it was great.

69
00:07:13,942 --> 00:07:14,902
You should go to...

70
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:16,820
...the nurse.
You might have a concussion.

71
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:19,865
What's your name?

72
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:21,533
You don't know my name?

73
00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:23,702
No, I know your name.

74
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:25,579
I want to know
if you know your name.

75
00:07:27,331 --> 00:07:28,874
Peter.

76
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,127
- Parker. Peter Parker.
- Okay. Okay, good.

77
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:41,387
I'd still go to the nurse though.

78
00:07:41,553 --> 00:07:42,805
You're Gwen, right?

79
00:07:42,972 --> 00:07:44,181
Gwen Stacy.

80
00:07:44,556 --> 00:07:46,183
All right.

81
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:49,103
Hey.

82
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,187
I'm making...

83
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:52,064
...spaghetti and meatballs tonight.

84
00:07:52,648 --> 00:07:54,900
You're serious?
Spaghetti and meatballs.

85
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:58,779
Since when don't you like
spaghetti and meatballs, huh?

86
00:07:59,238 --> 00:08:00,990
- Oh, my God.
- What's up?

87
00:08:01,156 --> 00:08:02,700
What happened to your face?

88
00:08:02,866 --> 00:08:05,244
I'm all right. Just-- I fell, skating.

89
00:08:05,577 --> 00:08:06,996
It's all right.

90
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:09,707
Ben Parker, don't you even...

91
00:08:09,873 --> 00:08:12,835
...think about leaving
that filthy box in my kitchen.

92
00:08:13,002 --> 00:08:14,044
My bowling trophies.

93
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:15,754
Oh, well, then, by all means...

94
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:17,423
...leave that box in my kitchen.

95
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:19,049
- What happened to you?
- He fell.

96
00:08:19,216 --> 00:08:22,011
Why you kids ride those things,
I'll never know.

97
00:08:22,177 --> 00:08:23,762
Because it's stupid and dangerous.

98
00:08:23,929 --> 00:08:25,556
Remember when we were stupid?

99
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:26,724
No.

100
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,018
- Trust me, we were.
- All right. Good to know.

101
00:08:29,184 --> 00:08:30,102
Where's the flood?

102
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:31,770
Follow me. I'll show you.

103
00:08:31,937 --> 00:08:33,147
- You serious?
- Yes.

104
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:34,940
All right.

105
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,776
<i>It's the condenser tray.</i>

106
00:08:38,444 --> 00:08:41,530
Too much water for the condenser tray
or the heat exchange tubing.

107
00:08:41,697 --> 00:08:43,615
This has got to be the fill line.

108
00:08:43,782 --> 00:08:46,160
That's the only thing
that makes any sense.

109
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:47,661
Can you fix it?

110
00:08:48,245 --> 00:08:51,081
No, not tonight.
I'll go by the hardware store tomorrow.

111
00:08:51,248 --> 00:08:53,667
Good deal. And meanwhile,
put this on your face.

112
00:08:55,627 --> 00:08:57,379
How's the other guy look?

113
00:08:58,964 --> 00:09:02,092
Come on.
I know a right cross when I see one.

114
00:09:03,218 --> 00:09:06,055
Yes or no?
Do I have to call somebody's father?

115
00:09:06,597 --> 00:09:07,514
No, no.

116
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:08,766
All right.

117
00:09:08,932 --> 00:09:11,018
Well, I wouldn't tell your Aunt May.

118
00:09:11,602 --> 00:09:14,480
I pity the poor kid
who'd have to suffer her wrath.

119
00:09:16,106 --> 00:09:17,733
Before you come up, see if...

120
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,319
...there's anything else worth saving.
- Okay.

121
00:09:37,336 --> 00:09:39,463
- Plumbers don't fix appliances.
- Yes, they do.

122
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,215
They fix pipes and pump things.

123
00:09:41,382 --> 00:09:43,217
If you ask them to--

124
00:09:47,513 --> 00:09:50,182
I forgot all about that thing.

125
00:09:50,349 --> 00:09:51,225
It was your dad's.

126
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:53,227
- Yeah.
- He asked us to keep it safe.

127
00:09:57,272 --> 00:10:00,651
He saw it in the window of that
leather shop over on 9th Avenue.

128
00:10:01,318 --> 00:10:04,488
He was 19. What does a 19-year-old kid
need with a briefcase?

129
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,448
And guess who sold it to him.

130
00:10:06,615 --> 00:10:08,283
- I don't know.
- Your mother.

131
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,535
That's how they met.

132
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:11,495
He asked you to...

133
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,622
...keep this safe?
There's nothing in here.

134
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:15,541
Have you looked?
There's nothing here.

135
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,835
Your father was
a very secretive man, Peter.

136
00:10:19,044 --> 00:10:20,504
Yeah, I know.

137
00:10:26,552 --> 00:10:27,511
Who's that?

138
00:10:27,678 --> 00:10:29,221
Do you know who that is?

139
00:10:29,346 --> 00:10:30,723
Some guy who worked with...

140
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:32,016
...your dad, I guess.

141
00:10:36,895 --> 00:10:38,814
Just take this off the table, all right?

142
00:10:38,981 --> 00:10:42,026
We're gonna eat. Off.
And wash your hands.

143
00:10:42,192 --> 00:10:44,069
- Now.
- All right.

144
00:10:44,236 --> 00:10:45,237
Go on.

145
00:11:21,065 --> 00:11:22,483
<i>I need you to be a good boy.</i>

146
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,776
Where are you going?

147
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:25,110
There's something...

148
00:11:25,277 --> 00:11:27,279
...your mom and I have to do.

149
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:25,671
What is this?

150
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,801
"Zero, zero, decay rate algorithm."

151
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,222
Yeah, one sec, one sec.

152
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,024
Come in.

153
00:12:45,691 --> 00:12:46,525
You okay?

154
00:12:46,692 --> 00:12:49,028
- Yeah. What's up?
- Oh, my God.

155
00:12:49,194 --> 00:12:50,487
You look just like him.

156
00:12:51,363 --> 00:12:53,449
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

157
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,788
Listen...

158
00:12:59,955 --> 00:13:01,415
...I don't have much education.

159
00:13:01,582 --> 00:13:03,042
You know that, Peter.

160
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,879
Hell, I stopped being able to help
with your homework when you were 10.

161
00:13:07,171 --> 00:13:09,631
What I'm trying to say is...

162
00:13:10,174 --> 00:13:12,551
...I know it's been rough
for you without your dad.

163
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,887
And I know we don't talk
much about them.

164
00:13:15,054 --> 00:13:16,972
- Yeah, it's all right.
- No, it is not...

165
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:18,515
...all right.

166
00:13:19,516 --> 00:13:22,186
I wish I could change it, but I can't.

167
00:13:24,063 --> 00:13:25,439
Curt Connors.

168
00:13:26,065 --> 00:13:28,859
That's the name of the guy
in the picture with your dad.

169
00:13:29,026 --> 00:13:31,362
They worked together for years
and they were close.

170
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:33,906
But after that night,
we never saw him again.

171
00:13:34,531 --> 00:13:36,033
He never even called.

172
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,409
Not once.

173
00:13:39,912 --> 00:13:41,538
Go figure.

174
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:46,126
She's pretty.

175
00:13:51,548 --> 00:13:52,591
Uncle Ben.

176
00:13:52,758 --> 00:13:54,009
What?

177
00:13:54,593 --> 00:13:56,095
You're a pretty great dad.

178
00:14:52,151 --> 00:14:53,444
Excuse me.

179
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,403
What?

180
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,155
Can I help you?

181
00:14:56,322 --> 00:14:57,990
I don't know. I'm here to see...

182
00:14:58,157 --> 00:14:59,616
...Dr. Connors.
- Right.

183
00:14:59,783 --> 00:15:01,660
You'll find yourself to the left.

184
00:15:03,495 --> 00:15:05,247
You are here for the internship?

185
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:07,499
Yeah. Yeah.

186
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:08,751
Okay.

187
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:10,794
You'll find your badge to the left.

188
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:17,676
Having trouble finding yourself?

189
00:15:18,427 --> 00:15:19,345
No. Yeah, I got it.

190
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:22,681
Okay...

191
00:15:22,848 --> 00:15:24,725
...Mr. Guevara.

192
00:15:27,853 --> 00:15:29,980
<i>Welcome to Oscorp.</i>

193
00:15:30,147 --> 00:15:32,983
<i>Born from the mind of our founder,
Norman Osborn...</i>

194
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,820
<i>...the Oscorp Tower houses
108 floors of innovation.</i>

195
00:15:37,946 --> 00:15:41,992
<i>Our scientific minds are pushing the
boundaries of defence, biomedical...</i>

196
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:44,953
<i>...and chemical technologies.
The future lies within.</i>

197
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:46,413
Welcome to Oscorp.

198
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,873
I'm Gwen Stacy, a senior...

199
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,916
...at Midtown Science...

200
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,501
...and head intern to Dr. Connors.

201
00:15:50,668 --> 00:15:52,836
I'll be with you
for the duration of your visit.

202
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:54,672
Where I go, you go.

203
00:15:54,838 --> 00:15:56,548
That's the rule. Remember that...

204
00:15:56,715 --> 00:15:58,175
...all will be fine.
- Come on!

205
00:15:58,342 --> 00:15:59,718
- If you forget that--
- Listen!

206
00:15:59,885 --> 00:16:00,803
Look, listen.

207
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,554
Tell them Rodrigo Guevara is here.

208
00:16:02,721 --> 00:16:03,806
Just tell them...

209
00:16:03,973 --> 00:16:05,015
...Rodrigo Guevara is here!

210
00:16:05,182 --> 00:16:06,350
My name's Rodrigo!

211
00:16:06,517 --> 00:16:09,353
I guess I don't need to tell you
what happens if you forget.

212
00:16:10,229 --> 00:16:10,896
Shall we?

213
00:16:18,904 --> 00:16:20,531
Come around this way.

214
00:16:24,743 --> 00:16:25,911
Good afternoon, Gwen.

215
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:27,037
Dr. Connors.

216
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,956
Welcome.

217
00:16:29,123 --> 00:16:31,917
My name is Dr. Curtis Connors.

218
00:16:32,084 --> 00:16:34,336
Yes, in case you're wondering,
I'm a southpaw.

219
00:16:34,503 --> 00:16:35,754
I'm not a cripple...

220
00:16:35,921 --> 00:16:39,258
...I'm a scientist, and the world's
foremost authority on herpetology.

221
00:16:39,425 --> 00:16:42,177
That's reptiles,
for those of you who don't know.

222
00:16:42,344 --> 00:16:43,804
Like the Parkinson's patient...

223
00:16:43,971 --> 00:16:46,682
...who watches on in horror
as her body...

224
00:16:46,849 --> 00:16:50,269
...slowly betrays her, or the man
with macular degeneration...

225
00:16:50,436 --> 00:16:54,273
...whose eyes grow dimmer each day,
I long to fix myself.

226
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,277
I want to create a world
without weakness.

227
00:16:58,444 --> 00:17:01,405
Anyone care to venture a guess
just how?

228
00:17:01,905 --> 00:17:02,781
Yes.

229
00:17:02,948 --> 00:17:03,907
Stem cells?

230
00:17:04,074 --> 00:17:05,659
Promising. But the solution...

231
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:08,620
...I'm thinking of is more radical.

232
00:17:10,914 --> 00:17:12,458
- No one?
- Cross-species genetics.

233
00:17:20,716 --> 00:17:21,925
Person gets Parkinson's...

234
00:17:22,092 --> 00:17:24,470
...when the brain cells
that produce dopamine...

235
00:17:24,637 --> 00:17:26,639
...start to disappear.

236
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:28,474
But a zebra fish has the ability...

237
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:30,851
...to regenerate cells on command.

238
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,936
If you could give this ability...

239
00:17:33,103 --> 00:17:35,981
...to the woman you're talking about,
that's that. She's...

240
00:17:37,024 --> 00:17:38,359
She's curing herself.

241
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:41,403
Yeah, you just have to look past
the gills on her neck.

242
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,158
And you are...?

243
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:50,204
He's one of Midtown Science's...

244
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:51,872
...best and brightest.
- Really?

245
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,040
Second in his class.

246
00:17:54,124 --> 00:17:56,001
- Second?
- Yeah.

247
00:17:56,168 --> 00:17:57,002
Sure about that?

248
00:17:57,169 --> 00:17:58,629
I'm pretty sure.

249
00:18:02,132 --> 00:18:06,011
I'm afraid duty calls. I'll leave you in the
more-than-capable hands of Miss Stacy.

250
00:18:06,345 --> 00:18:08,055
Nice meeting you all.

251
00:18:11,183 --> 00:18:12,685
If you'd like to gather round.

252
00:18:12,851 --> 00:18:14,853
<i>Welcome to Oscorp's tree of life.</i>

253
00:18:15,688 --> 00:18:18,440
<i>Our planet's tree of life is immense.</i>

254
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:20,150
<i>At Oscorp's...</i>

255
00:18:20,317 --> 00:18:22,027
<i>-...Cross-Species Division...
- Hi.</i>

256
00:18:22,194 --> 00:18:25,197
<i>...we endeavour to explore
exciting new methods...</i>

257
00:18:26,615 --> 00:18:27,825
What are you doing, "Rodrigo"?

258
00:18:30,869 --> 00:18:32,121
Oh, yeah.

259
00:18:32,287 --> 00:18:33,539
What are you doing here?

260
00:18:33,706 --> 00:18:34,873
I work here. I don't.

261
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,625
I was gonna say I work here...

262
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:40,004
...but it seems like you do work here.
So you know that I don't.

263
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:41,046
You following me?

264
00:18:41,213 --> 00:18:44,341
No, I'm not following you, no.
I had no idea you worked here.

265
00:18:44,508 --> 00:18:45,718
Why would you be here?

266
00:18:45,884 --> 00:18:47,720
I just snuck in because...

267
00:18:47,886 --> 00:18:49,305
I love science.

268
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,265
- You love it.
- I'm passionate about it.

269
00:18:51,432 --> 00:18:53,058
So you snuck in--?

270
00:18:53,225 --> 00:18:55,394
- I have to lead this tour group.
- I know.

271
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:58,480
I'll ask you more about this later.
Do not get me in trouble.

272
00:18:58,647 --> 00:19:00,899
- I promise you I won't.
- Stay with the group.

273
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:05,029
All right, guys? I'm gonna take you
to the bioreactor room now.

274
00:19:08,824 --> 00:19:10,326
Sorry. Yo.

275
00:19:11,744 --> 00:19:12,828
Sorry.

276
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:39,850
We received the results from
the mRNA sequences this morning.

277
00:21:40,017 --> 00:21:42,811
They were disappointing.

278
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:49,735
Define "disappointing."

279
00:21:49,902 --> 00:21:51,236
Another dead end.

280
00:21:51,403 --> 00:21:53,072
It's the decay rate algorithm.

281
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,741
- And this is to be expected.
- Expected?

282
00:21:55,908 --> 00:21:57,242
You said you were close.

283
00:21:57,409 --> 00:21:59,578
We are close,
but it's gonna take time.

284
00:21:59,745 --> 00:22:00,954
He doesn't have time.

285
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:03,415
Norman Osborn is dying,
Dr. Connors.

286
00:22:03,957 --> 00:22:05,209
Save him.

287
00:22:07,503 --> 00:22:09,380
Or we'll both lose our heads.

288
00:22:27,773 --> 00:22:29,233
All right, give me the badge.

289
00:22:31,443 --> 00:22:32,778
Give it to me.

290
00:22:36,448 --> 00:22:37,825
Sorry.

291
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:41,096
Disgusting. Now I smell like beer.

292
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:43,849
I didn't mean to do that.

293
00:23:44,016 --> 00:23:45,434
I didn't mean to...

294
00:23:45,601 --> 00:23:47,353
ldidn't-- I didn't--

295
00:23:48,687 --> 00:23:49,855
Get your hand off her!

296
00:23:50,022 --> 00:23:51,690
I'm trying to get my...

297
00:23:55,361 --> 00:23:56,278
Are you kidding?

298
00:23:56,445 --> 00:23:57,237
I'm sorry.

299
00:23:57,404 --> 00:23:58,614
Are you kidding me?

300
00:23:59,198 --> 00:24:00,908
- Hey, get him, Rudy!
- Hey!

301
00:24:04,203 --> 00:24:05,371
Ma". I'm sorry!

302
00:24:05,537 --> 00:24:06,622
Man, are you all right?

303
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:11,085
- Take him down!
- Come on.

304
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:15,297
Get him, man! Get him!

305
00:24:18,092 --> 00:24:19,343
No, man, no. Not my board.

306
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,803
Please, dude, don't--

307
00:24:22,721 --> 00:24:23,806
Sorry!

308
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,769
Sorry. Sorry.

309
00:24:28,936 --> 00:24:30,229
I'm so sorry.

310
00:24:34,233 --> 00:24:36,735
<i>Coney Island, next stop.</i>

311
00:24:36,902 --> 00:24:38,862
<i>Next and final stop, Coney Island.</i>

312
00:24:50,874 --> 00:24:51,542
Hey.

313
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,044
Hey. HEY-

314
00:24:54,211 --> 00:24:55,421
Sorry. I'm late.

315
00:24:55,587 --> 00:24:57,256
- I got--
- We've been so worried.

316
00:24:57,423 --> 00:24:58,549
I know. I'm sorry.

317
00:24:58,716 --> 00:25:00,050
Watch out!

318
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:08,309
That's a fly, Peter.

319
00:25:12,438 --> 00:25:14,023
Yeah.

320
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,487
I'm so sorry...

321
00:25:20,654 --> 00:25:21,822
...I kept you guys UP-

322
00:25:21,989 --> 00:25:25,326
I'm insensitive, I'm irresponsible...

323
00:25:25,868 --> 00:25:27,286
...and I'm hungry.

324
00:25:31,707 --> 00:25:33,375
Meatloaf.

325
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,129
Drinking?

326
00:25:37,296 --> 00:25:38,339
What's this?

327
00:25:38,505 --> 00:25:39,882
I don't think so.

328
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:41,717
This is your meatloaf.

329
00:25:43,927 --> 00:25:45,971
This beats all other meat loafs.

330
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,266
Something is very wrong.

331
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:50,934
Yeah.

332
00:25:51,101 --> 00:25:53,145
Nobody likes your meatloaf.

333
00:25:59,318 --> 00:26:00,819
I got it.

334
00:26:04,323 --> 00:26:06,659
He took the frozen
macaroni and cheese.

335
00:26:07,368 --> 00:26:08,661
I noticed that.

336
00:26:09,745 --> 00:26:12,456
Why didn't you tell me
you didn't like my meatloaf?

337
00:26:12,706 --> 00:26:14,917
You could have said that to me
37 years ago.

338
00:26:15,084 --> 00:26:17,753
How many meat loafs
have I made for you?

339
00:29:08,924 --> 00:29:09,675
Peter.

340
00:29:11,051 --> 00:29:12,177
What are you doing?

341
00:29:12,344 --> 00:29:13,846
'M...

342
00:29:14,972 --> 00:29:15,931
Homework.

343
00:29:16,098 --> 00:29:17,641
Be careful.

344
00:29:17,808 --> 00:29:19,393
Sure.

345
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:30,029
Dr. Connors.

346
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:33,532
You don't remember me. I--

347
00:29:33,699 --> 00:29:34,950
The intern from the other day.

348
00:29:35,534 --> 00:29:37,202
Yeah, yeah. That's right, yeah.

349
00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:39,663
I'm sure you're very nice,
but this is a home.

350
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:42,166
I ask you to make an appointment
with my office.

351
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:43,709
I'm Richard Parker's son.

352
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,176
Peter?

353
00:29:54,803 --> 00:29:55,471
I'm afraid...

354
00:29:55,638 --> 00:29:58,932
...I can't help you much. I don't know
why they left or where they...

355
00:29:59,099 --> 00:29:59,850
...were going.

356
00:30:02,645 --> 00:30:04,104
Good reflexes.

357
00:30:04,271 --> 00:30:05,648
Thank you.

358
00:30:10,653 --> 00:30:12,738
- Thank you.
- I read your book.

359
00:30:12,905 --> 00:30:14,365
Yeah.

360
00:30:14,531 --> 00:30:15,699
It's something, you know.

361
00:30:15,866 --> 00:30:17,660
So you really think...

362
00:30:17,826 --> 00:30:20,537
...it's possible, cross-species genetics?
- Yes, of course.

363
00:30:20,704 --> 00:30:23,165
Your father and I
were mocked for our theories.

364
00:30:23,332 --> 00:30:26,085
Not just in the community at large,
but at Oscorp, as well.

365
00:30:26,251 --> 00:30:28,379
They called us mad scientists.

366
00:30:29,421 --> 00:30:31,882
And then your father
bred the spiders...

367
00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:33,425
...and everything changed.

368
00:30:33,592 --> 00:30:35,260
The results were
beyond encouraging.

369
00:30:35,427 --> 00:30:37,388
They were spectacular.

370
00:30:39,431 --> 00:30:42,518
We were gonna change
the lives of millions.

371
00:30:42,685 --> 00:30:44,645
Including my own.

372
00:30:45,145 --> 00:30:46,730
Then it was over.

373
00:30:47,606 --> 00:30:50,526
He was gone.

374
00:30:51,235 --> 00:30:53,195
Took his research with him.

375
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:56,865
And I knew without him, I...

376
00:31:04,289 --> 00:31:06,041
I----

377
00:31:07,626 --> 00:31:09,795
I was angry.

378
00:31:12,548 --> 00:31:14,049
So I stayed away from you...

379
00:31:14,216 --> 00:31:16,135
...and your family.

380
00:31:16,302 --> 00:31:18,220
And for that, I'm truly sorry.

381
00:31:26,603 --> 00:31:28,230
Say...

382
00:31:28,856 --> 00:31:29,982
Say it worked.

383
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:32,318
Say you got it to work.

384
00:31:32,818 --> 00:31:36,780
Like, how much would
the foreign species take over?

385
00:31:37,656 --> 00:31:39,825
What could the side effects be?

386
00:31:43,454 --> 00:31:46,623
It's hard to say,
considering no subject survived.

387
00:31:47,082 --> 00:31:48,417
The problem was always--

388
00:31:48,584 --> 00:31:50,002
The decay rate algorithm?

389
00:31:52,921 --> 00:31:54,465
- Right.
- Right.

390
00:31:55,883 --> 00:31:57,009
Can I...?

391
00:31:57,176 --> 00:31:58,844
Of course.

392
00:32:21,367 --> 00:32:22,701
Extraordinary.

393
00:32:23,369 --> 00:32:25,162
How did you come up with this?

394
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,463
Peter, how about coming
to see me at the Tower...

395
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,548
...one day after school?
- Yeah.

396
00:32:38,842 --> 00:32:40,511
Thank you.

397
00:33:01,365 --> 00:33:02,157
Number one, Reggie.

398
00:33:02,324 --> 00:33:03,242
Run it, buddy.

399
00:33:03,409 --> 00:33:04,952
Let's go. Reggie-

400
00:33:08,372 --> 00:33:09,123
Rejected!

401
00:33:11,792 --> 00:33:13,502
You did that on purpose, Flash!

402
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:15,754
I should've.
You better watch your back.

403
00:33:19,717 --> 00:33:21,385
Hey.

404
00:33:23,262 --> 00:33:24,221
All right?

405
00:33:30,978 --> 00:33:31,770
Give it up.

406
00:33:37,276 --> 00:33:38,360
Come on, man.

407
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,280
One sec.

408
00:33:44,616 --> 00:33:47,077
- Come on, man.
- Why don't you take it from me?

409
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,499
That's right. Take it.

410
00:33:53,042 --> 00:33:54,293
Go ahead. Take it.

411
00:34:15,272 --> 00:34:16,106
Just take it.

412
00:34:18,484 --> 00:34:20,653
All right, how about this?

413
00:34:21,487 --> 00:34:22,488
All right?

414
00:34:22,655 --> 00:34:23,572
How about that?

415
00:34:27,826 --> 00:34:29,953
- Come on, Flash.
- Flash, stop playing, man.

416
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,247
- Take it from him!
- Come on, Flash. Take it.

417
00:34:32,414 --> 00:34:33,749
Yo, Flash, let's go.

418
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:35,417
- Let's go!
- Do it, Flash.

419
00:34:35,584 --> 00:34:37,336
- Stop playing, man.
- Let's go, Flash.

420
00:34:37,503 --> 00:34:39,171
- What are you doing?
- What's up?

421
00:34:40,923 --> 00:34:41,715
What you doing?

422
00:34:44,718 --> 00:34:46,845
All right, bring it!
Come on, Parker! Come on!

423
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:02,027
Peter's behaviour is just...

424
00:35:02,194 --> 00:35:02,987
...unacceptable.

425
00:35:03,153 --> 00:35:04,029
<i>They won't make us pay...</i>

426
00:35:04,196 --> 00:35:07,032
-...for the backboard.
- I don't care about the backboard.

427
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:08,909
- Was that true?
- What?

428
00:35:09,076 --> 00:35:10,869
What I heard in there just now.

429
00:35:11,036 --> 00:35:13,998
Did you humiliate that boy?

430
00:35:14,873 --> 00:35:16,041
Yeah, I did.

431
00:35:17,209 --> 00:35:18,210
- But--
- But what?

432
00:35:18,377 --> 00:35:19,837
- This guy deserved it.
- Did he?

433
00:35:20,004 --> 00:35:21,714
- Yeah.
- Is he the kid that hit you?

434
00:35:24,049 --> 00:35:25,301
Is he?

435
00:35:25,467 --> 00:35:27,303
Yeah, yeah, but...

436
00:35:27,469 --> 00:35:29,555
So all this is about getting even.

437
00:35:30,055 --> 00:35:33,559
If so, I guess you must feel pretty good
about yourself now, right?

438
00:35:33,726 --> 00:35:34,727
Am I right or wrong?

439
00:35:36,729 --> 00:35:38,314
Yeah, I thought so.

440
00:35:38,939 --> 00:35:41,275
Well, thanks to this
little escapade of yours...

441
00:35:41,442 --> 00:35:43,402
...I had to change shifts at work...

442
00:35:43,569 --> 00:35:47,239
...so you have to pick up Aunt May
tonight at 9:00. Understood?

443
00:35:47,781 --> 00:35:49,199
- Is that understood?
- Yeah.

444
00:35:49,366 --> 00:35:51,076
Okay, good.

445
00:35:53,412 --> 00:35:54,538
She looks familiar.

446
00:35:57,082 --> 00:35:58,542
The girl on your computer.

447
00:35:59,209 --> 00:36:00,377
Yeah.

448
00:36:00,502 --> 00:36:03,505
He's got you on his computer.
I'm his probation officer.

449
00:36:04,214 --> 00:36:05,924
Don't forget Aunt May.

450
00:36:09,678 --> 00:36:11,430
Okay.

451
00:36:15,059 --> 00:36:17,019
He's a character.

452
00:36:17,144 --> 00:36:18,187
That's my uncle.

453
00:36:18,354 --> 00:36:20,397
He's a pathological liar.

454
00:36:20,564 --> 00:36:21,940
He thought you were someone else.

455
00:36:22,107 --> 00:36:24,610
Oh, man, you don't have me
on your computer?

456
00:36:24,777 --> 00:36:27,905
I took a photo of the debate team,
and you're in the debate team.

457
00:36:28,072 --> 00:36:29,782
- Right.
- So...

458
00:36:29,948 --> 00:36:32,284
...he must have seen--
I was touching up stuff.

459
00:36:33,118 --> 00:36:34,620
- Touching up stuff?
- Come on.

460
00:36:35,287 --> 00:36:37,456
I was... I'm not gonna answer that.

461
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:42,044
- Did you get expelled?
- No, no.

462
00:36:42,169 --> 00:36:44,421
I didn't get expelled.
I got community service.

463
00:36:47,675 --> 00:36:50,678
So you want to-- I don't know...?

464
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:52,972
Want to what?

465
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:54,848
I don't know.

466
00:36:55,015 --> 00:36:56,725
Just...

467
00:37:01,981 --> 00:37:04,441
I don't know-- We could...

468
00:37:05,484 --> 00:37:07,403
We could do something else,
or we could--

469
00:37:07,569 --> 00:37:10,030
- If you don't feel like, we could--
- Yeah.

470
00:37:10,197 --> 00:37:11,740
- Yeah?
- Yeah, either one.

471
00:37:13,158 --> 00:37:15,285
- Really?
- Sure.

472
00:37:16,161 --> 00:37:16,996
Okay.

473
00:37:17,121 --> 00:37:18,497
All right, good. Sounds good.

474
00:37:18,664 --> 00:37:19,623
Cool.

475
00:37:20,165 --> 00:37:21,667
Okay.

476
00:37:21,834 --> 00:37:24,169
- I can't right now, I can't right now.
- Yeah, no.

477
00:37:24,336 --> 00:37:26,505
- I'm so busy right now.
- I know, me too.

478
00:37:28,841 --> 00:37:31,677
But maybe...

479
00:37:31,844 --> 00:37:34,013
- Yeah, just, you know...
- Some other...

480
00:37:34,179 --> 00:37:35,848
- Time, all right.
- Okay.

481
00:37:36,015 --> 00:37:37,683
- Bye.
- All right.

482
00:39:05,646 --> 00:39:08,315
We have protein structure, rDNA...

483
00:39:08,482 --> 00:39:10,567
...chromatography,
transgenics testing...

484
00:39:10,734 --> 00:39:13,988
...that's X-ray video. That's the only
one on the planet. We have...

485
00:39:14,405 --> 00:39:16,949
- Human line testing over--
- I remember that.

486
00:39:17,116 --> 00:39:18,784
I've seen that before.

487
00:39:18,951 --> 00:39:20,244
The Ganali device.

488
00:39:20,411 --> 00:39:23,122
Yeah, I remember a picture of that
in my dad's office.

489
00:39:23,247 --> 00:39:25,791
The idea was so simple.
You load it with an antigen.

490
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:29,420
It creates a cloud which can be dispersed
over a neighbourhood, even a city.

491
00:39:29,545 --> 00:39:32,965
Theoretically, you could
cure polio in an afternoon.

492
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,134
That's incredible.

493
00:39:35,259 --> 00:39:38,554
Well, others disagreed. What if
the device were loaded with a toxin?

494
00:39:38,721 --> 00:39:40,723
What if you wanted to opt out?
You can't...

495
00:39:40,889 --> 00:39:44,310
...run away from a cloud after all,
so here it lies, gathering dust.

496
00:39:45,144 --> 00:39:47,771
What you see here
is a computer model of a lizard.

497
00:39:47,938 --> 00:39:51,150
Many of these wonderful creatures
have so brilliantly adapted...

498
00:39:51,317 --> 00:39:53,819
...that they can regenerate
entire limbs at will.

499
00:39:53,986 --> 00:39:55,821
You can imagine my envy.

500
00:39:55,988 --> 00:39:57,906
We're trying to harness
this capability...

501
00:39:58,073 --> 00:40:00,326
...and transfer it
into our host subject:

502
00:40:00,492 --> 00:40:02,745
Freddy the three-legged mouse.

503
00:40:03,787 --> 00:40:05,956
Enter the algorithm now.

504
00:40:09,168 --> 00:40:10,127
Need to take that?

505
00:40:16,258 --> 00:40:16,925
<i>System ready...</i>

506
00:40:17,092 --> 00:40:18,677
<i>...for gene insertion.</i>

507
00:40:18,844 --> 00:40:20,471
Okay.

508
00:40:21,013 --> 00:40:22,389
Check.

509
00:40:24,266 --> 00:40:25,476
See what I'm trying to do?

510
00:40:25,643 --> 00:40:27,519
- Preempt the proteins.
- The immune response.

511
00:40:27,686 --> 00:40:28,854

00:40:52,878 --> 00:40:54,505

525
00:40:58,676 --> 00:41:00,552
And thank you.

526
00:41:01,428 --> 00:41:02,429
Meet Fred and Wilma...

527
00:41:02,638 --> 00:41:03,889
...our three-legged...

528
00:41:04,056 --> 00:41:05,182
...mice.

529
00:41:08,268 --> 00:41:09,311
Here you go.

530
00:41:11,146 --> 00:41:12,815
HEY. buddy. I got you.

531
00:41:14,525 --> 00:41:15,442
Okay.

532
00:41:15,609 --> 00:41:17,695
Careful, don't want to stick you
by mistake.

533
00:41:17,861 --> 00:41:19,738
Human trials aren't until next week.

534
00:41:22,658 --> 00:41:23,534
There.

535
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:32,668
Hey.

536
00:41:32,835 --> 00:41:35,212
Hey, I thought you...

537
00:41:35,379 --> 00:41:37,297
Didn't you forget something?

538
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:39,216
What?

539
00:41:39,341 --> 00:41:43,220
Now, don't answer that,
but I'm glad to know it's working.

540
00:41:44,263 --> 00:41:48,183
You owe your aunt
an apology bigtime.

541
00:41:50,269 --> 00:41:51,186
Be a man.

542
00:41:51,312 --> 00:41:53,063
Get in there and apologise.

543
00:41:56,525 --> 00:41:58,027
I'm sorry, Aunt May, I...

544
00:41:58,152 --> 00:41:59,486
Honestly, you don't have...

545
00:41:59,653 --> 00:42:01,238
...to apologise to me. It's your--

546
00:42:01,405 --> 00:42:03,198
- The hell he doesn't.
- Ben.

547
00:42:04,074 --> 00:42:05,951
Look, I'm sorry, I got distracted.

548
00:42:06,118 --> 00:42:08,037
- Oh, he got distracted.
- Yeah.

549
00:42:08,203 --> 00:42:11,332
Your aunt, my wife,
had to walk 12 blocks alone...

550
00:42:11,498 --> 00:42:14,960
...in the middle of the night and then
wait in a deserted subway station...

551
00:42:15,127 --> 00:42:16,378
...because you got distracted.

552
00:42:16,545 --> 00:42:18,213
Ben, sweetheart, honestly...

553
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,424
...I am completely capable
of walking home--

554
00:42:20,549 --> 00:42:22,635
You will not defend this boy!

555
00:42:22,801 --> 00:42:24,094
- I'm not defending--
- You are!

556
00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:26,764
- Listen to me, son.
- Yeah, go ahead.

557
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:28,474
You're a lot like your father.

558
00:42:28,641 --> 00:42:31,143
You really are, Peter,
and that's a good thing...

559
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:34,438
...but your father lived by a philosophy,
a principle, really.

560
00:42:34,605 --> 00:42:37,941
He believed that if you could do
good things for other people...

561
00:42:38,108 --> 00:42:40,569
...you had a moral obligation
to do those things.

562
00:42:40,736 --> 00:42:42,321
That's what's at stake here.

563
00:42:42,446 --> 00:42:43,489
Not choice.

564
00:42:43,656 --> 00:42:45,658
Responsibility.

565
00:42:47,826 --> 00:42:50,329
That is nice. That's great.

566
00:42:51,246 --> 00:42:53,457
That's all well and good.
So where is he?

567
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:56,543
- What?
- Where is he?

568
00:42:56,877 --> 00:42:58,671
Where's my dad?

569
00:42:58,837 --> 00:43:02,341
He didn't think it was his responsibility
to be here to tell me himself?

570
00:43:02,508 --> 00:43:03,842
Oh, come on, how dare you?

571
00:43:04,009 --> 00:43:05,719
How dare I? How dare you?

572
00:43:10,349 --> 00:43:11,350
Where you going?

573
00:43:11,517 --> 00:43:13,310
Peter, come back here, please.

574
00:43:22,861 --> 00:43:25,990
Ben, leave him alone for a little while.
He'll be all right.

575
00:43:39,003 --> 00:43:40,004
Peter!

576
00:43:42,673 --> 00:43:44,216
Peter?

577
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,223
Peter!

578
00:43:56,312 --> 00:43:57,271
It's $2.07.

579
00:44:00,733 --> 00:44:01,775
It's $2.07.

580
00:44:01,942 --> 00:44:03,277
Yeah. No, I know.

581
00:44:03,444 --> 00:44:06,280
Yeah, you're holding up the line. No.

582
00:44:06,405 --> 00:44:08,741
You can leave a penny,
you can't take a penny.

583
00:44:09,825 --> 00:44:11,076
- What?
- You can leave...

584
00:44:11,285 --> 00:44:13,912
...a penny anytime,
you have to spend 10 dollars...

585
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,998
...to take a penny.
It's store policy.

586
00:44:16,165 --> 00:44:18,584
- You're holding up my line.
- I don't have 2 cents.

587
00:44:18,751 --> 00:44:20,419
You can't afford milk, step aside.

588
00:44:20,586 --> 00:44:22,838
Daddy didn't give you
enough milk money today?

589
00:44:23,005 --> 00:44:24,340
We're talking about 2 cents.

590
00:44:24,506 --> 00:44:25,549
Just step aside, kid.

591
00:44:32,389 --> 00:44:33,474
Really?

592
00:44:46,612 --> 00:44:48,238
Yo, not cool, bro.

593
00:44:50,949 --> 00:44:52,117
Hey, man, stop!

594
00:44:52,242 --> 00:44:53,744
Somebody stop that guy!

595
00:44:53,911 --> 00:44:55,287
Hey, kid, little help?

596
00:44:55,412 --> 00:44:56,830
Not my policy.

597
00:44:57,247 --> 00:44:58,457
Somebody stop that dude!

598
00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:00,125
Hey!

599
00:45:00,292 --> 00:45:01,585
Hey, stop!

600
00:45:02,711 --> 00:45:04,380
Somebody stop that dude!

601
00:45:13,055 --> 00:45:13,931
Hey!

602
00:45:44,461 --> 00:45:46,338
Oh, God, oh, God.

603
00:45:46,505 --> 00:45:48,048
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

604
00:45:48,674 --> 00:45:50,301
Call an ambulance!

605
00:45:50,467 --> 00:45:52,886
Someone call an ambulance!
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

606
00:45:53,512 --> 00:45:55,180
Oh, God, oh, my God.

607
00:45:58,851 --> 00:46:00,561
On, God.

608
00:46:03,939 --> 00:46:05,316
No.

609
00:46:07,484 --> 00:46:09,445
Oh, Jesus.

610
00:46:13,365 --> 00:46:17,328
Witnesses gave a description to the
sketch artist. I need you to take a look.

611
00:46:21,707 --> 00:46:23,542
No, I don't know him.

612
00:46:24,501 --> 00:46:27,254
I didn't expect you would, ma'am.
Homicide detectives...

613
00:46:27,421 --> 00:46:29,381
...are on it.
We'll see what they turn up.

614
00:46:29,548 --> 00:46:31,216
Okay.

615
00:46:36,764 --> 00:46:38,182
Can I have that?

616
00:46:38,349 --> 00:46:39,725
Sure.

617
00:46:42,061 --> 00:46:44,021
There's one other thing.
He has a star...

618
00:46:44,188 --> 00:46:44,938
<i>tattooed...</i>

619
00:46:45,105 --> 00:46:46,357
<i>...on his left hand.</i>

620
00:47:13,842 --> 00:47:18,347
<i>Peter, I know things
have been difficult lately...</i>

621
00:47:18,806 --> 00:47:20,641
<i>...and I'm sorry about that.</i>

622
00:47:21,225 --> 00:47:23,435
<i>I think I know what you're feeling.</i>

623
00:47:39,576 --> 00:47:41,245
Hey, Parker.

624
00:47:42,246 --> 00:47:44,373
- Not today.
- Come on, I just want to talk.

625
00:47:49,628 --> 00:47:51,463
It feels better, right?

626
00:47:52,464 --> 00:47:53,966
Look, your uncle died.

627
00:47:54,633 --> 00:47:56,093
I'm sorry.

628
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:57,720
I get it.

629
00:47:58,137 --> 00:47:59,680
I'm sorry.

630
00:48:00,055 --> 00:48:01,640
Okay?

631
00:48:07,938 --> 00:48:09,189
Peter.

632
00:48:52,733 --> 00:48:53,859
Stay away from him.

633
00:48:54,026 --> 00:48:55,027
- You understand?
- Hey!

634
00:48:55,194 --> 00:48:56,612
- Stay away from Joey.
- Hey!

635
00:48:58,864 --> 00:49:00,157
You like beating on girls?

636
00:49:00,491 --> 00:49:01,867
You like beating on old men?

637
00:49:02,034 --> 00:49:02,701
Hey, pal...

638
00:49:02,868 --> 00:49:03,661
...keep walking.

639
00:49:03,827 --> 00:49:06,246
- You're in the wrong place.
- When were you in Queens?

640
00:49:06,872 --> 00:49:08,082
I asked you a question.

641
00:49:08,248 --> 00:49:09,166
Nicky, no!

642
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:10,042
That the gun?

643
00:49:10,209 --> 00:49:11,293
You gonna kill me too?

644
00:49:13,295 --> 00:49:14,421
Hey! Stop it!

645
00:49:15,339 --> 00:49:16,256
Hey. get off!

646
00:49:17,383 --> 00:49:18,676
Wait, oh, don't hit Nicky!

647
00:49:18,842 --> 00:49:20,052
Back up!

648
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,846
This guy is crazy!

649
00:49:23,639 --> 00:49:24,723
Get him!

650
00:49:29,228 --> 00:49:31,480
Get back here, man! Get him!

651
00:49:38,237 --> 00:49:39,071
Follow him!

652
00:49:42,783 --> 00:49:44,451
- Go around, man!
- I'll follow you!

653
00:49:53,836 --> 00:49:54,586
Go, go, go!

654
00:49:55,921 --> 00:49:57,131
There he is!

655
00:49:57,297 --> 00:49:58,132
Can't get away!

656
00:50:14,773 --> 00:50:16,608
<i>He has a star tattooed
on his left hand.</i>

657
00:50:28,495 --> 00:50:29,371
Oh, yeah?

658
00:50:29,538 --> 00:50:30,539
Come on!

659
00:50:37,963 --> 00:50:39,506
I know what you look like!

660
00:50:39,673 --> 00:50:41,467
You hear me?

661
00:50:41,884 --> 00:50:44,261
I've seen your face!

662
00:51:22,007 --> 00:51:23,676
Is that all you got?

663
00:51:25,344 --> 00:51:26,845
Just take it, take it.

664
00:51:32,184 --> 00:51:35,020
<i>Engineered from
genetically enhanced spiders...</i>

665
00:51:35,187 --> 00:51:39,608
<i>...Oscorp's BioCable tensile strength
is unparalleled. We're just beginning...</i>

666
00:51:39,775 --> 00:51:43,529
<i>...to understand all the potential
industrial applications.</i>

667
00:51:43,696 --> 00:51:47,199
<i>A single pellet can safely store
several hundred metres...</i>

668
00:51:47,366 --> 00:51:49,201
<i>...of the lightweight cable.</i>

669
00:51:58,168 --> 00:51:58,961
Mother...

670
00:52:56,477 --> 00:53:01,148
<i>Attention, all units in the confines
of Precinct 13, receiving a 10-30...</i>

671
00:53:01,315 --> 00:53:03,609
<i>...on West 19th Street
and Broadway.</i>

672
00:53:03,776 --> 00:53:06,528
<i>Assailant is Caucasian male,
mid-30s...</i>

673
00:53:06,695 --> 00:53:09,615
<i>...170 to 180 pounds...</i>

674
00:53:09,782 --> 00:53:11,158
<i>...shoulder-length blond hair.</i>

675
00:53:11,325 --> 00:53:13,952
<i>Last seen on foot
heading eastbound on 19th Street.</i>

676
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:33,847
Hey.

677
00:53:42,606 --> 00:53:43,649
You got a description?

678
00:53:43,816 --> 00:53:45,025
Well, no, he wears a mask.

679
00:53:45,651 --> 00:53:46,819
A mask?

680
00:53:46,986 --> 00:53:48,153
Most of his victims...

681
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,699
...are suspects with serious rap sheets.
They're calling him a vigilante.

682
00:53:51,865 --> 00:53:54,243
Okay, he's not a vigilante,
he's an anarchist.

683
00:53:54,410 --> 00:53:57,037
Help me, somebody! Arrest me!

684
00:53:57,204 --> 00:53:58,330
Get me out of here.

685
00:53:59,748 --> 00:54:01,083
Hey, look!

686
00:54:12,219 --> 00:54:14,179
Spandex. Spandex.

687
00:54:14,972 --> 00:54:15,973
Everything...

688
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,016
...spandex.

689
00:54:17,349 --> 00:54:19,518
Extraordinary velocity vector
is a function...

690
00:54:19,685 --> 00:54:21,520
...of both mass and acceleration.

691
00:54:21,687 --> 00:54:23,480
Come on,
you know better than anyone...

692
00:54:23,647 --> 00:54:26,108
...the weight on any pendulum
has no effect on speed.

693
00:54:26,275 --> 00:54:30,029
It doesn't affect frequency,
but it's totally a factor in momentum.

694
00:55:06,398 --> 00:55:07,858
Hey, Aunt May.

695
00:55:08,567 --> 00:55:10,361
Yeah.Eggs?

696
00:55:10,527 --> 00:55:11,779
Organic, got it.

697
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,522
In the future,
if you're gonna steal cars...

698
00:55:46,689 --> 00:55:48,649
...don't dress like a car thief, man.

699
00:55:48,816 --> 00:55:50,359
What are you? You a cop?

700
00:55:51,193 --> 00:55:55,447
Really? You seriously think I'm a cop?
Cop in a skin-tight red-and-blue suit?

701
00:55:55,614 --> 00:55:57,116
You know, you're...

702
00:55:57,866 --> 00:55:59,284
You've got a mind...

703
00:55:59,451 --> 00:56:00,911
...of the true scholar, sir.

704
00:56:01,078 --> 00:56:03,455
I was going more for the guys
who do the luge.

705
00:56:03,998 --> 00:56:05,124
Good thinking.

706
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:06,834
Get out the window.

707
00:56:07,001 --> 00:56:08,293
There you go. You got it.

708
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:18,137
Crotch!

709
00:56:20,973 --> 00:56:23,309
- Just let me go.
- Is that a real knife?

710
00:56:23,475 --> 00:56:24,643
Yes, it's a real knife.

711
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:26,312
My weakness, it's small knives.

712
00:56:26,478 --> 00:56:28,063
- Just let me go.
- Anything but...

713
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:30,149
...knives! Oh, it's so simple.

714
00:56:30,316 --> 00:56:31,775
- That was cool.
- What is this?

715
00:56:31,942 --> 00:56:34,528
Webbing I developed.
I don't think you want to know.

716
00:56:34,695 --> 00:56:35,362
Let me go!

717
00:56:37,281 --> 00:56:38,991
Okay, one second.
Hold on, one second.

718
00:56:39,158 --> 00:56:40,284
Knock it off, man. No!

719
00:56:41,535 --> 00:56:43,829
Come on, let me go. Stop it!

720
00:56:44,663 --> 00:56:45,706
That isn't funny.

721
00:56:45,873 --> 00:56:47,333
- It is kind of funny.
- Help!

722
00:56:58,218 --> 00:56:59,678
This could've gone a lot worse.

723
00:56:59,845 --> 00:57:01,805
Now hold still.

724
00:57:07,353 --> 00:57:08,687
Boys in blue here.

725
00:57:08,854 --> 00:57:11,357
- Yo, I got him.
- Freeze!

726
00:57:11,523 --> 00:57:13,359
- He's not going anywhere.
- Don't move.

727
00:57:13,525 --> 00:57:14,526
You serious?

728
00:57:14,693 --> 00:57:15,861
Who are you?

729
00:57:16,278 --> 00:57:17,988
No one grasps
the concept of the mask.

730
00:57:18,155 --> 00:57:18,947
Freeze!

731
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:23,535
I just did 80 percent of your job.

732
00:57:24,078 --> 00:57:24,828
And that?

733
00:57:24,995 --> 00:57:25,913
That's how you repay me?

734
00:57:29,541 --> 00:57:30,709
Hold it right there!

735
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,773
Well, that was fun.

736
00:57:54,233 --> 00:57:55,859
Bus! Hey there, everybody.

737
00:57:59,822 --> 00:58:00,948
What are you doing?

738
00:58:05,536 --> 00:58:06,620
Hey, watch out.

739
00:58:06,787 --> 00:58:07,913
I'm swinging here.

740
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,581
I'm swinging here.

741
00:58:24,722 --> 00:58:27,474
So 38 of New York's finest...

742
00:58:27,641 --> 00:58:30,811
...versus one guy in a unitard.

743
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:32,938
Am I correct?

744
00:58:46,952 --> 00:58:48,495
You don't have to wait up for me.

745
00:58:48,662 --> 00:58:49,955
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

746
00:58:50,122 --> 00:58:51,123
Yes, I do.

747
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:52,624
- Okay.
- Where were you?

748
00:58:52,791 --> 00:58:53,834
I was out.

749
00:58:54,001 --> 00:58:55,961
Did you get the eggs?

750
00:58:57,504 --> 00:58:59,006
Nope. Forgot the eggs.

751
00:58:59,173 --> 00:59:00,382
I'm gonna get them now.

752
00:59:00,549 --> 00:59:02,134
No, you most certainly will not.

753
00:59:02,301 --> 00:59:04,303
Not at this hour.

754
00:59:06,138 --> 00:59:08,015
Look at me, Peter.

755
00:59:09,767 --> 00:59:12,353
Take off the damn hood
and look at me.

756
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:23,155
Peter. Where do you go?

757
00:59:23,322 --> 00:59:24,782
Who does this to you?

758
00:59:24,948 --> 00:59:26,742
Please go to sleep, Aunt May.

759
00:59:26,909 --> 00:59:28,911
- Please tell me.
- Aunt May, please...

760
00:59:29,078 --> 00:59:31,121
...please, please go to sleep.

761
00:59:31,288 --> 00:59:34,333
I can't sleep.
Don't you understand? I can't sleep.

762
00:59:45,844 --> 00:59:48,347
Peter, listen to me.

763
00:59:49,056 --> 00:59:50,265
Secrets have a cost.

764
00:59:50,432 --> 00:59:51,976
They're not for free.

765
00:59:52,142 --> 00:59:54,353
Not now, not ever.

766
01:00:02,069 --> 01:00:04,029
Cross-species genetics
is finally working.

767
01:00:04,363 --> 01:00:07,533
I've used the lizard DNA
to help Freddy regrow that limb.

768
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,284
It's a miracle.

769
01:00:09,451 --> 01:00:11,036
No, it's hard work and promise.

770
01:00:11,203 --> 01:00:15,124
- It's a step closer to the primate lab.
- He doesn't have time for every little step.

771
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:16,208
Little?

772
01:00:16,375 --> 01:00:17,918
I just mean he can't wait.

773
01:00:18,085 --> 01:00:19,753
Well, he'll have to.

774
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:21,839
Unless he wants to be a lab rat.

775
01:00:22,006 --> 01:00:22,881
That's not what...

776
01:00:23,048 --> 01:00:23,882
...I'm saying-

777
01:00:24,049 --> 01:00:25,217
So, what are you saying?

778
01:00:25,884 --> 01:00:28,178
You have to start human trials.

779
01:00:28,887 --> 01:00:29,638
Now.

780
01:00:29,805 --> 01:00:31,974
No, I don't, and no, I won't.

781
01:00:32,141 --> 01:00:34,101
- Well, then he's going to die.
- People die.

782
01:00:35,394 --> 01:00:37,313
Even Norman Osborn.

783
01:00:37,479 --> 01:00:38,480
We are not finished.

784
01:00:38,647 --> 01:00:40,232
Human trials?

785
01:00:40,399 --> 01:00:42,985
Where are you going
to find the people to volunteer?

786
01:00:43,152 --> 01:00:45,738
As far as anyone's concerned,
it's for a flu shot.

787
01:00:45,904 --> 01:00:48,782
I might think the Veterans Hospital
is a place to start.

788
01:00:48,949 --> 01:00:50,284
You've gotta be kidding me.

789
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:52,494
I don't think I am.

790
01:00:58,959 --> 01:01:01,253
It's a little late for
shock and indignation.

791
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:02,546
About 15 years late.

792
01:01:02,755 --> 01:01:04,590
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

793
01:01:04,757 --> 01:01:06,258
Richard Parker wore it well.

794
01:01:06,425 --> 01:01:09,261
On you, it's a cheap suit,
as it was then.

795
01:01:09,428 --> 01:01:10,888
I had nothing to do with that.

796
01:01:11,055 --> 01:01:12,598
Is that what you told his son?

797
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:19,563
I don't know what you're saying.

798
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:22,274
You don't know,
or you don't wanna know?

799
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,111
I'll remind you what happened.

800
01:01:26,278 --> 01:01:29,740
Richard Parker said just about the same
thing then that you are saying now.

801
01:01:32,117 --> 01:01:35,287
The clock is ticking, Dr. Connors.

802
01:01:36,288 --> 01:01:38,040
I----

803
01:01:45,673 --> 01:01:47,299
I won't.

804
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:51,136
Fine.

805
01:01:55,724 --> 01:01:58,435
The formula is ours now anyway.

806
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,398
Say goodbye to that arm
you have dreamed of.

807
01:02:02,564 --> 01:02:04,108
I'm shutting you down.

808
01:02:04,274 --> 01:02:07,194
Have your office cleared out
by the morning.

809
01:02:07,361 --> 01:02:10,864
Your toys can be taken away too,
you know.

810
01:02:12,992 --> 01:02:14,076
Right, Freddy?

811
01:02:29,299 --> 01:02:30,342
- Hey.
- Hi.

812
01:02:30,509 --> 01:02:31,302
How's it going?

813
01:02:31,468 --> 01:02:32,678
Where you headed?

814
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:36,223
- Monday, B track.
- Oh, it's Thursday.

815
01:02:36,724 --> 01:02:38,350
- It's Thursday?
- What happened?

816
01:02:38,517 --> 01:02:40,185
- What?
- Your eye, it looks bruised.

817
01:02:40,352 --> 01:02:41,603
Oh, yeah, no, I don't...

818
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:43,397
Maybe I got a rash or...

819
01:02:43,564 --> 01:02:45,357
It's bad.
Have you gone to the nurse?

820
01:02:47,609 --> 01:02:49,320
Do you like branzino?

821
01:02:50,362 --> 01:02:51,697
Like, a fish

822
01:02:51,864 --> 01:02:53,699
No, no. I know. I know.

823
01:02:53,866 --> 01:02:56,076
Well, if you want...

824
01:02:56,243 --> 01:03:00,748
...you can come to this address
at 8:00 tonight.

825
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:03,208
My mom's making branzino.

826
01:03:03,709 --> 01:03:05,127
So...

827
01:03:05,336 --> 01:03:06,170
It's apartment...

828
01:03:06,337 --> 01:03:08,672
...2016. I didn't write that part down.

829
01:03:08,839 --> 01:03:10,174
I don't know why I...

830
01:03:10,341 --> 01:03:12,176
- I'll remember it.
- Oh, okay.

831
01:03:12,343 --> 01:03:13,719
2016.

832
01:04:21,787 --> 01:04:23,122
Hi.

833
01:04:24,456 --> 01:04:25,708
How did you get out there?

834
01:04:26,583 --> 01:04:28,127
The fire escape.

835
01:04:29,294 --> 01:04:30,796
Your doorman's intimidating.

836
01:04:31,714 --> 01:04:33,340
It's 20 storeys.

837
01:04:33,716 --> 01:04:35,134
Yeah. It's all right.

838
01:04:39,305 --> 01:04:41,307
- This is your room.
- Yes, this is my room.

839
01:04:41,473 --> 01:04:43,142
Books.

840
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:44,810
Shoes.

841
01:04:45,436 --> 01:04:46,937
Oh, hey...

842
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:49,356
I got your mom...

843
01:04:49,523 --> 01:04:50,899
...these.

844
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:52,151
Oh, lovely.

845
01:04:52,318 --> 01:04:53,986
- Beautiful, right?
- Beautiful.

846
01:04:54,153 --> 01:04:55,529
They were nice.

847
01:04:55,696 --> 01:04:57,489
- No, they're beautiful.
- I'm sorry.

848
01:04:57,656 --> 01:05:00,409
No, it's impressive.
They actually held together very well.

849
01:05:00,576 --> 01:05:02,119
I'm gonna keep these.

850
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:04,330
You have your suit in there?

851
01:05:07,374 --> 01:05:09,043
My Suit?

852
01:05:09,209 --> 01:05:11,587
It's for dinner. Are you gonna--?

853
01:05:11,754 --> 01:05:12,880
Are you gonna wear that?

854
01:05:13,047 --> 01:05:14,048
- That's--
- Hey, hon.

855
01:05:19,678 --> 01:05:20,596
You must be Peter.

856
01:05:20,763 --> 01:05:22,598
Dad, this is Peter.

857
01:05:25,267 --> 01:05:26,477
Nice to meet you, sir.

858
01:05:27,686 --> 01:05:28,812
Nice to meet you.

859
01:05:28,979 --> 01:05:30,564
Dinner's ready.

860
01:05:31,357 --> 01:05:32,691
Hope you like branzino.

861
01:05:32,858 --> 01:05:34,401
Who doesn't?

862
01:06:33,919 --> 01:06:35,254
<i>Emma, it's Curt.</i>

863
01:06:36,005 --> 01:06:38,215
<i>- Is he there?
- I'm afraid not, doctor.</i>

864
01:06:38,382 --> 01:06:41,218
<i>The car is taking him
to the Veterans Hospital in Brooklyn.</i>

865
01:06:41,385 --> 01:06:42,594
No. He can't, Emma.

866
01:06:42,761 --> 01:06:45,055
You have to stop him. He--

867
01:06:45,222 --> 01:06:47,641
<i>I would, but I always lose him
on the bridge.</i>

868
01:06:47,808 --> 01:06:50,769
<i>I'll make sure Dr. Ratha returns
your call as soon as possible.</i>

869
01:07:00,779 --> 01:07:04,116
I'm going to Holton Avenue,
across the river. I'm in a hurry.

870
01:07:04,283 --> 01:07:06,327
You want me to take
the tunnel or the bridge?

871
01:07:06,493 --> 01:07:07,745
Bridge! Take the bridge.

872
01:07:07,911 --> 01:07:09,246
All right, we'll do that.

873
01:07:09,413 --> 01:07:10,497
Hey, you all right...

874
01:07:10,664 --> 01:07:11,415
...back there?

875
01:07:12,333 --> 01:07:13,000
You tweaking...

876
01:07:13,167 --> 01:07:14,376
...man?

877
01:07:15,502 --> 01:07:17,129
Just drive.

878
01:07:17,713 --> 01:07:18,922
Okay.

879
01:07:25,179 --> 01:07:26,680
You're having trouble there?

880
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,515
The head goes on the other--

881
01:07:28,682 --> 01:07:30,225
Help Gwen's friend with his fish.

882
01:07:30,392 --> 01:07:31,602
On, I...

883
01:07:31,769 --> 01:07:32,853
I got no idea.

884
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:34,563
First time.

885
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:36,315
- Branzino.
- George.

886
01:07:36,482 --> 01:07:39,234
- Tell us about your day.
- Did you catch that spider guy yet?

887
01:07:39,401 --> 01:07:40,986
No, we didn't catch him yet.

888
01:07:41,153 --> 01:07:43,030
But we will. He's an amateur...

889
01:07:43,197 --> 01:07:45,908
...who's assaulting civilians
in the dead of night.

890
01:07:46,075 --> 01:07:47,951
He's clumsy, he leaves clues...

891
01:07:48,118 --> 01:07:49,495
...but he's still dangerous.

892
01:07:50,371 --> 01:07:51,830
He's assaulting people?

893
01:07:53,666 --> 01:07:54,667
I'm not sure.

894
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:56,293
I mean, I saw that video...

895
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:58,420
...with him and the car thief, and...

896
01:07:58,587 --> 01:08:01,715
I think most people
would say that he was...

897
01:08:02,466 --> 01:08:03,842
...providing a public service.

898
01:08:04,551 --> 01:08:06,512
Most people would be wrong.

899
01:08:07,805 --> 01:08:11,266
If I wanted the car thief off the street,
he'd already be off the street.

900
01:08:11,433 --> 01:08:12,685
So why wasn't he then?

901
01:08:16,689 --> 01:08:17,731
Let me illuminate you.

902
01:08:17,898 --> 01:08:20,526
The car thief was leading us
to the people who run...

903
01:08:20,693 --> 01:08:22,903
...the operation.
It's a six-month-long sting.

904
01:08:23,070 --> 01:08:26,073
It's called strategy.
I'm sure you're aware of the term?

905
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,742
- You've heard about that in school?
- Yeah.

906
01:08:28,909 --> 01:08:29,785
Good.

907
01:08:29,952 --> 01:08:31,203
<i>I know.</i>

908
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:34,039
- He didn't know you had a plan.
- You seem to know...

909
01:08:34,206 --> 01:08:35,958
...a lot about this.
Know something we don't?

910
01:08:36,125 --> 01:08:38,419
- Whose side are you on?
- I'm not on anyone's side.

911
01:08:38,585 --> 01:08:39,962
I saw a video on the lnternet--

912
01:08:40,129 --> 01:08:41,672
You saw the video on the Internet.

913
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:44,049
- Well, then the case is closed.
- Well, no.

914
01:08:44,216 --> 01:08:45,175
If you watch the video--

915
01:08:45,342 --> 01:08:46,802
Maybe send you a link?

916
01:08:46,969 --> 01:08:48,637
It looks like he's trying to help.

917
01:08:48,804 --> 01:08:51,682
On the Internet he's being made out
to look like a hero.

918
01:08:51,849 --> 01:08:52,516
No, no.

919
01:08:52,683 --> 01:08:54,393
I'm not saying he's a hero.

920
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,895
- What are you trying to say?
- He's trying to help.

921
01:08:57,062 --> 01:08:58,397
He's trying to do something
the police can't.

922
01:08:58,564 --> 01:08:59,940
Something the police can't?

923
01:09:00,107 --> 01:09:01,650
- I don't know.
- What do you think we do?

924
01:09:01,817 --> 01:09:03,360
Sit around eating doughnuts...

925
01:09:03,527 --> 01:09:05,321
...with our thumbs
planted up our asses?

926
01:09:05,487 --> 01:09:07,531
- George. George.
- Daddy.

927
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:08,449
- Up your what?
- Howard.

928
01:09:08,615 --> 01:09:10,451
He stands for what you stand for.

929
01:09:10,617 --> 01:09:12,161
Protecting innocent people
from bad guys.

930
01:09:12,328 --> 01:09:14,413
I stand for law and order.
That's what I stand for.

931
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:16,165
Okay? I wear a badge.

932
01:09:16,332 --> 01:09:19,376
This guy wears a mask
like an outlaw.

933
01:09:19,543 --> 01:09:22,087
He's hunting down criminals
that all look the same...

934
01:09:22,254 --> 01:09:24,423
...like he's got some sort
of personal vendetta.

935
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:27,593
But he's not protecting
innocent people, Mr. Parker.

936
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:29,595
Let's get some air, Peter.

937
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:32,389
- Dad, we need to talk.
- Yes, we do.

938
01:09:34,767 --> 01:09:36,602
Thank you for having me. I'm sorry...

939
01:09:36,769 --> 01:09:39,021
...if I insulted you.
It was not my intention.

940
01:09:39,229 --> 01:09:42,524
- You're welcome.
- Branzino was real good, Mrs. Stacy.

941
01:09:42,691 --> 01:09:44,777
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

942
01:09:46,487 --> 01:09:49,031
- Dad.
- Yeah?

943
01:09:55,788 --> 01:09:57,706
Well, that was something.

944
01:09:59,166 --> 01:10:02,252
I'm sorry. I thought he was
going to arrest me at one point.

945
01:10:02,419 --> 01:10:05,047
No, I wouldn't
have let him arrest you

946
01:10:09,802 --> 01:10:12,513
- What happened to your face?
- I wanna tell you something.

947
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:15,641
Okay.

948
01:10:20,771 --> 01:10:22,064
I've been bitten...

949
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:27,277
So have I.

950
01:10:32,741 --> 01:10:34,159
Okay.

951
01:10:35,661 --> 01:10:38,163
Okay, okay, okay.
I gotta tell you this one thing.

952
01:10:38,330 --> 01:10:40,082
I gotta tell you this thing about...

953
01:10:40,249 --> 01:10:43,085
...the vigilante and the car thief.
- Oh, okay.

954
01:10:43,252 --> 01:10:44,920
What?

955
01:10:45,087 --> 01:10:47,339
- No, no, no.
- I don't want to talk about that.

956
01:10:47,506 --> 01:10:49,174
Forget that.
I won't talk about that.

957
01:10:49,341 --> 01:10:51,593
- I'm gonna talk about me, okay?
- What about you?

958
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:55,597
It's impo-- I wish I could just--

959
01:10:55,764 --> 01:10:57,016
I can't. It's hard to say.

960
01:10:57,182 --> 01:10:58,183
Just say it.

961
01:10:58,350 --> 01:11:00,477
- I don't know.
- Say it.

962
01:11:03,314 --> 01:11:04,606
What? What?

963
01:11:08,068 --> 01:11:09,778
What?

964
01:11:13,824 --> 01:11:15,701
Okay, then forget it.

965
01:11:23,834 --> 01:11:25,294
You...?

966
01:11:33,927 --> 01:11:36,055
- You're Spider-Man.
- Shut up.

967
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:42,561
Gwen?

968
01:11:43,812 --> 01:11:45,147
Gwen...

969
01:11:46,190 --> 01:11:48,108
Your father wants you to come inside.

970
01:11:48,525 --> 01:11:49,735
Okay.

971
01:11:49,902 --> 01:11:50,903
- Okay?
- Yeah.

972
01:11:53,697 --> 01:11:54,740
Gwen.

973
01:11:54,865 --> 01:11:56,575
I'm coming.

974
01:12:28,065 --> 01:12:29,858
Oh, I'm in trouble.

975
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:54,258
Will you please...

976
01:12:54,383 --> 01:12:56,302
...find out what is going on, Alfred?

977
01:13:03,726 --> 01:13:04,601
Excellent.

978
01:13:07,896 --> 01:13:08,897
Hey!

979
01:13:11,692 --> 01:13:13,027
Hey! What is that?

980
01:13:13,152 --> 01:13:15,070
- Oh, my God!
- I don't know!

981
01:13:15,195 --> 01:13:16,655
Get back in the car!

982
01:13:21,744 --> 01:13:23,120
Help!

983
01:13:24,830 --> 01:13:25,706
Help!

984
01:14:05,829 --> 01:14:08,040
Incoming!

985
01:14:29,019 --> 01:14:29,728
Somebody help!

986
01:14:30,562 --> 01:14:32,231
Help me! My kid is trapped!

987
01:14:41,991 --> 01:14:43,158
I want my dad!

988
01:14:43,492 --> 01:14:44,535
Dad!

989
01:14:44,702 --> 01:14:46,078
'HeY,hey,hey
- Help!

990
01:14:46,245 --> 01:14:46,912
L-ley, buddy.

991
01:14:47,037 --> 01:14:48,247
- It's okay.
- Get away.

992
01:14:49,206 --> 01:14:50,332
- Help!
- Hey, look.

993
01:14:51,875 --> 01:14:53,752
Just a normal guy, all right?

994
01:14:55,462 --> 01:14:56,338
Wanna hold this?

995
01:14:58,048 --> 01:14:58,841
Hold my mask.

996
01:14:59,425 --> 01:15:00,384
All right.

997
01:15:01,927 --> 01:15:03,387
What's your name?

998
01:15:03,554 --> 01:15:04,346
Jack?

999
01:15:05,264 --> 01:15:06,932
- Yes.
- Let's get you out of here.

1000
01:15:08,309 --> 01:15:10,060
Okay, stay very still.

1001
01:15:10,227 --> 01:15:11,061
All right.

1002
01:15:11,228 --> 01:15:12,479
Okay, I got you.

1003
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:17,568
Okay, look.

1004
01:15:17,735 --> 01:15:19,361
I'll undo the belt. You hold on...

1005
01:15:19,528 --> 01:15:21,572
...to that seat in front of you.
On three?

1006
01:15:21,822 --> 01:15:24,491
- All right.
- Okay, one, two, three.

1007
01:15:26,618 --> 01:15:28,787
See how easy that was?
You did a great job.

1008
01:15:28,954 --> 01:15:30,664
All right, okay.

1009
01:15:44,261 --> 01:15:45,638
Jack, climb now.

1010
01:15:45,804 --> 01:15:47,431
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1011
01:15:52,811 --> 01:15:54,813
Put it on, the mask.

1012
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:56,398
It's gonna make you strong.

1013
01:15:56,982 --> 01:15:58,317
Jack, trust me.

1014
01:15:58,484 --> 01:15:59,443
Put it on.

1015
01:16:00,235 --> 01:16:02,863
There you go. That's it.
That's it, buddy.

1016
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:04,156
Okay, now, climb.

1017
01:16:04,323 --> 01:16:05,324
Come on, Jack.

1018
01:16:09,078 --> 01:16:09,745
Do me a favour.

1019
01:16:09,912 --> 01:16:11,413
A little faster, okay, bud?

1020
01:16:11,664 --> 01:16:13,999
You're doing great, buddy.
You're doing great.

1021
01:16:14,166 --> 01:16:15,250
That's it. Keep coming.

1022
01:16:15,417 --> 01:16:16,835
Keep it coming.

1023
01:16:17,002 --> 01:16:18,045
Keep coming.

1024
01:16:18,962 --> 01:16:20,297
No!

1025
01:16:34,937 --> 01:16:36,647
Jack. Oh, God.

1026
01:16:36,814 --> 01:16:38,315
Thank God.

1027
01:16:40,025 --> 01:16:41,360
You okay?

1028
01:16:44,405 --> 01:16:45,864
My son. My son.

1029
01:16:46,699 --> 01:16:47,825
Oh, my son.

1030
01:16:47,950 --> 01:16:49,743
My son.

1031
01:16:54,206 --> 01:16:55,290
Who are you?

1032
01:16:57,710 --> 01:16:59,211
Spider-Man.

1033
01:17:46,258 --> 01:17:48,260
Beautiful.

1034
01:17:56,435 --> 01:17:57,478
Settle down, guys.

1035
01:17:58,479 --> 01:18:00,105
Settle down, boys. Settle down.

1036
01:18:00,272 --> 01:18:02,441
- Come on.
- Listen. At approximately...

1037
01:18:02,608 --> 01:18:06,070
...9 p.m. last night, an incident
took place on the Williamsburg Bridge.

1038
01:18:06,612 --> 01:18:08,447
<i>Much of what occurred
is speculation...</i>

1039
01:18:08,614 --> 01:18:11,408
<i>...at this point.
However, several eyewitnesses...</i>

1040
01:18:11,575 --> 01:18:14,995
<i>...to the crime, as well as
our own preliminary findings, have...</i>

1041
01:18:15,162 --> 01:18:16,288
<i>...positively placed...</i>

1042
01:18:16,455 --> 01:18:18,123
<i>...one individual at the scene.</i>

1043
01:18:18,290 --> 01:18:19,750
<i>Which is why, this morning...</i>

1044
01:18:19,917 --> 01:18:21,335
<i>...I am issuing a warrant...</i>

1045
01:18:21,502 --> 01:18:24,838
<i>...for the masked vigilante
known as Spider-Man.</i>

1046
01:18:30,761 --> 01:18:34,473
<i>And lastly, city council members met
with homeowners and airport officials...</i>

1047
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,308
<i>...in the first of four meetings...</i>

1048
01:18:43,607 --> 01:18:44,984
It's so beautiful.

1049
01:18:45,150 --> 01:18:46,986
Knows how to bite though.

1050
01:18:47,152 --> 01:18:48,904
Who else knows about this?

1051
01:18:49,071 --> 01:18:49,947
Just you.

1052
01:18:50,114 --> 01:18:51,365
Really?

1053
01:18:53,826 --> 01:18:55,744
Hey, you don't...

1054
01:18:56,495 --> 01:18:59,081
You don't believe what the police
are saying, do you?

1055
01:18:59,957 --> 01:19:01,458
Of course not.

1056
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:04,837
Does it scare you?

1057
01:19:05,004 --> 01:19:06,839
What you can do?

1058
01:19:09,341 --> 01:19:10,676
No.

1059
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:12,886
No.

1060
01:19:13,846 --> 01:19:15,973
What did that thing
on the bridge look like?

1061
01:19:16,515 --> 01:19:18,976
It was real big.
Too big to be human.

1062
01:19:19,351 --> 01:19:20,894
You gotta lay low.

1063
01:19:21,687 --> 01:19:23,063
No, can't do that.

1064
01:19:23,230 --> 01:19:24,815
You've got to.

1065
01:19:25,649 --> 01:19:27,151
I mean, why...?

1066
01:19:27,443 --> 01:19:29,945
Because of last night.

1067
01:19:30,112 --> 01:19:32,114
Those people on the bridge.

1068
01:19:32,281 --> 01:19:36,285
Whatever was attacking them
would have killed them.

1069
01:19:37,911 --> 01:19:38,620
So...

1070
01:19:38,787 --> 01:19:40,456
...I gotta go after it.

1071
01:19:41,957 --> 01:19:43,000
That's not your job.

1072
01:19:44,418 --> 01:19:46,003
Maybe it is.

1073
01:19:50,924 --> 01:19:52,468
I really liked kissing you.

1074
01:19:55,095 --> 01:19:56,597
You're an amazing kisser.

1075
01:19:59,391 --> 01:20:00,559
Well, you know, it was--

1076
01:20:00,726 --> 01:20:02,728
It was good for me too.

1077
01:20:05,397 --> 01:20:07,024
Yeah?

1078
01:20:16,408 --> 01:20:17,576
Who did that?

1079
01:20:39,306 --> 01:20:40,307
Hello!

1080
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:52,152
It's not nice to snoop.

1081
01:20:55,030 --> 01:20:56,949
I gave everyone the week off.

1082
01:20:59,159 --> 01:20:59,868
Yeah.

1083
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,454
Shouldn't you be at school?

1084
01:21:04,206 --> 01:21:06,250
No, I got a free track.

1085
01:21:06,417 --> 01:21:08,419
I wanted to ask you a question.

1086
01:21:09,128 --> 01:21:10,170
How would a predator...

1087
01:21:10,337 --> 01:21:11,630
...track a reptile?

1088
01:21:11,755 --> 01:21:14,633
Oh, they don't.
Most reptiles are at the top...

1089
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,051
...of their food chain.

1090
01:21:16,218 --> 01:21:17,720
Kings of their domain.

1091
01:21:17,886 --> 01:21:19,388
They gotta have vulnerabilities.

1092
01:21:19,555 --> 01:21:22,099
Why the sudden interest
in the cold-blooded?

1093
01:21:25,644 --> 01:21:26,937
Just asking a question.

1094
01:21:27,104 --> 01:21:29,940
I got school stuff.

1095
01:21:30,107 --> 01:21:32,109
Biology profiles to do.

1096
01:21:32,526 --> 01:21:34,778
So because of the cold blood...

1097
01:21:34,945 --> 01:21:36,864
...would they react to changes
in temperatures?

1098
01:21:37,031 --> 01:21:38,407
You'd have to catch one first.

1099
01:21:39,325 --> 01:21:42,619
Did you know there's a rumour
of a new species in New York?

1100
01:21:42,786 --> 01:21:44,288
Beautiful and quite large.

1101
01:21:45,456 --> 01:21:47,416
What do you know about it?
You seen it?

1102
01:21:47,583 --> 01:21:49,585
No, it's not yet classified.

1103
01:21:52,546 --> 01:21:54,548
But it can be aggressive...

1104
01:21:55,466 --> 01:21:56,383
...if threatened.

1105
01:22:04,141 --> 01:22:05,392
Doc, you all right?

1106
01:22:05,559 --> 01:22:08,187
Never been better, Peter.
Never been better.

1107
01:22:08,354 --> 01:22:09,897
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1108
01:22:10,064 --> 01:22:12,816
Afraid I have to ask you to leave.
I have a new project...

1109
01:22:12,983 --> 01:22:15,402
...I'm working on.
I need to be alone.

1110
01:22:16,028 --> 01:22:18,322
Good. Good, good.

1111
01:22:18,864 --> 01:22:20,699
Good.

1112
01:22:21,283 --> 01:22:24,203
Don't worry, Mr. Parker.
I'll be back.

1113
01:22:25,204 --> 01:22:27,331
Wonderful things are coming.

1114
01:22:28,582 --> 01:22:30,376
Wonderful things.

1115
01:22:44,932 --> 01:22:46,225
Fred?

1116
01:22:51,021 --> 01:22:53,232
Mr. Mayor,
if there was a giant dinosaur...

1117
01:22:53,399 --> 01:22:55,901
...running around
you would be the first to know.

1118
01:22:56,026 --> 01:22:58,612
So tell your son
he can rest easy, all right?

1119
01:22:58,779 --> 01:23:00,823
Yeah. You and me both, sir.

1120
01:23:00,990 --> 01:23:03,200
Okay. Bye-bye-

1121
01:23:03,325 --> 01:23:05,244
Mr. Parker, why are you...

1122
01:23:05,369 --> 01:23:07,246
...not in school?
- Got a free track.

1123
01:23:07,413 --> 01:23:08,664
Okay, well, I do not.

1124
01:23:08,831 --> 01:23:10,082
So make your point quickly.

1125
01:23:10,249 --> 01:23:12,626
Fine, there may not be a dinosaur
running around.

1126
01:23:12,751 --> 01:23:15,087
There is something more dangerous,
and I know who.

1127
01:23:15,254 --> 01:23:16,839
- You know who?
- Dr. Curtis Connors.

1128
01:23:17,006 --> 01:23:18,382
- He's a biochemist.
- Of Oscorp?

1129
01:23:18,549 --> 01:23:20,050
- That's right.
- Dr. Connors...

1130
01:23:20,217 --> 01:23:22,219
...who's my daughter's mentor.
Is that who?

1131
01:23:22,386 --> 01:23:23,595
- That's the one.
- Okay.

1132
01:23:23,762 --> 01:23:27,057
Recently, Dr. Connors gave Gwen
a college recommendation.

1133
01:23:27,224 --> 01:23:29,268
It was beautiful.
When I read it, I cried.

1134
01:23:29,393 --> 01:23:31,603
You would have me believe
that he...

1135
01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:33,981
...is running around dressed up
like a dinosaur?

1136
01:23:34,148 --> 01:23:37,818
Not dressing up and not a dinosaur.
He has transformed himself into a lizard.

1137
01:23:41,071 --> 01:23:42,614
Let me ask you a question.

1138
01:23:42,781 --> 01:23:45,909
Do I look like the mayor
of Tokyo to you?

1139
01:23:46,035 --> 01:23:48,537
I'm telling you the absolute truth.

1140
01:23:48,704 --> 01:23:51,749
This man has worked for his whole life
on cross-species genetics.

1141
01:23:51,915 --> 01:23:55,461
He lost an arm, he tried to grow it back,
but the equation was imbalanced.

1142
01:23:55,627 --> 01:23:58,088
He has turned into a lizard.
He's using lizard DNA.

1143
01:23:58,255 --> 01:24:01,967
He is dangerous, and he is planning
something horrific. I know. I know.

1144
01:24:02,134 --> 01:24:04,595
Okay. All right, I get it.

1145
01:24:05,471 --> 01:24:06,513
Here's what we'll do.

1146
01:24:06,972 --> 01:24:09,767
You'll go back to hanging out
with the citizens of Tokyo.

1147
01:24:09,933 --> 01:24:12,144
I'm gonna go back
to protecting the citizens...

1148
01:24:12,311 --> 01:24:14,355
...of this fine, fair city of ours.

1149
01:24:14,521 --> 01:24:16,774
Sergeant Butler,
please escort Mr. Parker...

1150
01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:19,902
...back to school.
- Captain Stacy, I'm not messing around.

1151
01:24:20,069 --> 01:24:23,113
Just bring him in. Just call him in.
You have to call him in.

1152
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:24,907
He is a danger to everybody.

1153
01:24:25,074 --> 01:24:27,326
- Just, please, listen to me.
- Let's go.

1154
01:24:31,664 --> 01:24:32,998
Jimmy.

1155
01:24:34,208 --> 01:24:37,086
Get me everything we have
on Dr. Curtis Connors.

1156
01:24:37,211 --> 01:24:39,797
- Okay? Right away.
- Yeah.

1157
01:25:05,197 --> 01:25:07,157
Subject: Dr. Curtis Connors.

1158
01:25:07,324 --> 01:25:08,867
Current temperature: 89.7.

1159
01:25:09,034 --> 01:25:10,494
Steady for 48 hours.

1160
01:25:10,661 --> 01:25:13,163
Blood panels reveal
lymphocyte and monocyte readings...

1161
01:25:13,330 --> 01:25:14,999
...consistent with subject's past.

1162
01:25:20,754 --> 01:25:22,423
Clotting rate vastly improved.

1163
01:25:22,589 --> 01:25:24,091
Marked enhancement...

1164
01:25:24,258 --> 01:25:25,592
...in muscle response...

1165
01:25:25,759 --> 01:25:27,136
...strength and elasticity.

1166
01:25:34,977 --> 01:25:37,062
Eyesight similarly improved.

1167
01:25:37,229 --> 01:25:39,732
Subject no longer requires
corrective lenses.

1168
01:25:45,070 --> 01:25:46,989
This is no longer about curing ills.

1169
01:25:47,531 --> 01:25:48,907
This is about...

1170
01:25:49,033 --> 01:25:50,159
...finding perfection.

1171
01:25:59,418 --> 01:26:01,503
In attempt to redress
regenerative relapse...

1172
01:26:01,628 --> 01:26:05,424
...dosage has been increased
to 200 milligrams.

1173
01:27:40,227 --> 01:27:41,979
You stopped me once.

1174
01:27:42,813 --> 01:27:45,190
You won't stop me again.

1175
01:27:47,192 --> 01:27:50,195
I'm getting stronger every day!

1176
01:28:28,942 --> 01:28:30,486
Oh, that sucked.

1177
01:28:41,914 --> 01:28:43,582
Peter Parker.

1178
01:29:01,266 --> 01:29:02,810
Come in.

1179
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:06,605
You should maybe...

1180
01:29:06,772 --> 01:29:08,607
...consider coming in
through the lobby.

1181
01:29:10,234 --> 01:29:13,278
Also, my father is under
the impression...

1182
01:29:13,404 --> 01:29:16,281
...that you require psychiatric attention.
- Oh, really?

1183
01:29:16,532 --> 01:29:18,117
Peter.

1184
01:29:18,617 --> 01:29:19,660
What happened?

1185
01:29:19,785 --> 01:29:21,161
You should see the other guy.

1186
01:29:22,997 --> 01:29:27,418
The other guy, in this instance,
being a giant mutant lizard.

1187
01:29:27,584 --> 01:29:28,585
Hey, Gwen, honey.

1188
01:29:28,752 --> 01:29:29,670
Do you want cocoa?

1189
01:29:29,837 --> 01:29:30,963
Howard's making some.

1190
01:29:35,551 --> 01:29:36,969
No, Dad, I do not want cocoa.

1191
01:29:37,136 --> 01:29:38,804
Honestly, I'm 17 years old.

1192
01:29:38,971 --> 01:29:39,805
Okay.

1193
01:29:39,972 --> 01:29:44,018
I remembered somebody saying her
fantasy was to live in a chocolate house.

1194
01:29:44,184 --> 01:29:45,644
Well, that's impractical.

1195
01:29:45,769 --> 01:29:47,229
And fattening.

1196
01:29:50,482 --> 01:29:51,567
Chocolate house.

1197
01:29:54,445 --> 01:29:56,238
- Sorry, Dad.
- It's good.

1198
01:29:56,405 --> 01:29:59,199
I can't have cocoa right now
because I'm work--

1199
01:29:59,325 --> 01:30:02,453
I'm doing this...

1200
01:30:02,619 --> 01:30:04,246
I have cramps.

1201
01:30:05,122 --> 01:30:07,166
I feel kind of pukey and just sort of...

1202
01:30:07,333 --> 01:30:09,626
- Like, emotional. I keep crying.
- It's okay. Good.

1203
01:30:09,752 --> 01:30:11,503
- Good.
- It's brutal.

1204
01:30:12,379 --> 01:30:13,714
You don't want to know.

1205
01:30:13,881 --> 01:30:15,049
- It's, like, bad.
- Got it.

1206
01:30:15,215 --> 01:30:17,176
- Thanks, Daddy.
- All right.

1207
01:30:42,284 --> 01:30:44,703
Easy, Bug BOY

1208
01:30:45,454 --> 01:30:46,872
What'd you call me?

1209
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:53,796
I'm going to be all right.

1210
01:30:53,962 --> 01:30:56,674
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes.

1211
01:30:58,050 --> 01:31:00,552
I know what this is.

1212
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:02,054
What is it?

1213
01:31:02,972 --> 01:31:06,141
Every day, for as long
as I can remember, my father...

1214
01:31:06,308 --> 01:31:07,768
...has left every morning...

1215
01:31:07,935 --> 01:31:10,604
...and he's put a badge on his chest...

1216
01:31:10,771 --> 01:31:13,065
...and strapped a gun to his hip.

1217
01:31:15,734 --> 01:31:18,112
And every day,
for as long as I can remember...

1218
01:31:18,278 --> 01:31:20,739
...I haven't known if he was
gonna make it home.

1219
01:31:30,290 --> 01:31:32,126
<i>L</i> 901 you

1220
01:31:33,377 --> 01:31:34,545
Okay?

1221
01:31:37,256 --> 01:31:38,257
Okay?

1222
01:31:39,842 --> 01:31:41,927
I gotta stop him, though.

1223
01:31:42,594 --> 01:31:45,514
I have to, because I created him.

1224
01:31:48,809 --> 01:31:50,269
What do you mean?

1225
01:31:51,687 --> 01:31:53,772
I gave him an equation...

1226
01:31:56,317 --> 01:31:58,444
...that made all of this possible.

1227
01:32:06,076 --> 01:32:08,954
Something my father
had been working on, you know.

1228
01:32:09,121 --> 01:32:12,124
Secretly. Now I realise
why he kept it a secret.

1229
01:32:14,918 --> 01:32:17,379
Point is, this is my responsibility.

1230
01:32:20,716 --> 01:32:22,885
I have to fix it.

1231
01:32:25,971 --> 01:32:27,640
Peter.

1232
01:32:28,682 --> 01:32:30,392
Hey.

1233
01:32:33,687 --> 01:32:35,814
Let's get out of here.

1234
01:32:35,981 --> 01:32:37,775
Let's just get out of here.

1235
01:32:37,941 --> 01:32:39,652
Just for a minute. Can we?

1236
01:32:40,361 --> 01:32:42,321
- No. No.
- Yeah. Yes.

1237
01:32:42,488 --> 01:32:43,656
- Yes.
- No.

1238
01:32:43,822 --> 01:32:44,990
Yes.

1239
01:32:45,157 --> 01:32:47,660
If my parents see me leaving,
I'm dead.

1240
01:32:52,247 --> 01:32:54,333
Your parents aren't
gonna see you leaving.

<i>...humanity on an evolutionary scale.</i>

<i>One has to adapt to survive.</i>

"That, changing like the snake,
I might be free...

1252

01:33:57,187 --> 01:33:58,188

Go. Go!

1261
01:35:05,339 --> 01:35:07,341
Nowhere to hide, Peter.

1262
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:25,901
All these souls...

1263
01:35:26,068 --> 01:35:27,319
...lost and alone.

1264
01:35:27,486 --> 01:35:28,362
I can save them.

1265
01:35:28,529 --> 01:35:30,155
I can cure them.

1266
01:35:30,322 --> 01:35:31,907
There's no need to stop me...

1267
01:35:32,074 --> 01:35:32,992
...Peter.

1268
01:35:42,543 --> 01:35:44,628
You're not thinking straight, doc.

1269
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:49,967
Stop this. This isn't you.

1270
01:35:55,139 --> 01:35:56,098
Let's talk this out.

1271
01:35:57,224 --> 01:35:57,975
Doc!

1272
01:36:04,064 --> 01:36:05,107
Oh, boy.

1273
01:36:10,696 --> 01:36:11,739
You don't want to talk?

1274
01:36:12,573 --> 01:36:14,116
There you go.

1275
01:36:17,745 --> 01:36:18,954
Don't...

1276
01:36:19,747 --> 01:36:21,332

...hurt you!

1279
01:36:31,842 --> 01:36:33,177
That is disgusting.

1280
01:36:43,228 --> 01:36:44,605
Gwen.

1281
01:37:08,545 --> 01:37:10,756
- I'm gonna throw you out the window.
- What?

1282
01:37:23,978 --> 01:37:25,020
Somebody's been...

1283
01:37:25,187 --> 01:37:26,855
...a bad lizard.

1284
01:38:13,736 --> 01:38:15,821
This is Lieutenant Williams
from the New York City...

1285
01:38:15,988 --> 01:38:19,450
...Police Department.
We've got this building surrounded.

1286

Alpha, let's move ahead. Go!

1287
01:38:42,264 --> 01:38:43,557
- Hey.
- Where are you?

1288
01:38:43,724 --> 01:38:44,642
I'm fine. I'm okay.

1289
01:38:44,808 --> 01:38:48,187
I'm in the sewer, tracking him. I gotta
stop him before anyone gets hurt.

1290
01:38:48,354 --> 01:38:49,480
But we need an antidote.

1291

Okay, I need you to go to Oscorp.

On my WHY

1297
01:39:34,942 --> 01:39:38,570
<i>I spent my life as a scientist trying

<i>...without outcasts.</i>

Oscorp.

1310
01:40:14,481 --> 01:40:15,607
- Captain Stacy!
- What?

1311
01:40:15,774 --> 01:40:18,235
We have a confirmed sighting, sir.
The Lizard's headed...

1312
01:40:18,402 --> 01:40:20,612
...toward Canal Street.
- What about Spider-Man?

1313
01:40:20,779 --> 01:40:21,989
Inside the high school.

1314
01:40:22,156 --> 01:40:24,074
I want that Spider-Man off the street.

1315
01:42:10,681 --> 01:42:13,559
<i>The lizard creature
has released a biological agent.</i>

1316
01:42:13,726 --> 01:42:15,519
<i>All efforts to stop him have failed...</i>

1317
01:42:15,686 --> 01:42:18,897
<i>...and he is now proceeding
north on 7th Avenue. Over.</i>

1318
01:42:22,901 --> 01:42:23,777
- Hi.
- Where are you?

1319
01:42:23,944 --> 01:42:25,237
<i>Peter, hi. I'm at Oscorp.</i>

1320
01:42:25,404 --> 01:42:27,156
You have to get out of there now.

1321
01:42:27,323 --> 01:42:29,700
- The antidote is cooking.
- No, no, no.

1322
01:42:29,867 --> 01:42:32,328
<i>Connors is on the way.
He's coming to you right now.</i>

1323
01:42:32,494 --> 01:42:35,039
He needs the device.
He's gonna infect the whole city!

1324
01:42:35,205 --> 01:42:36,373
Eight minutes left.

1325
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:39,084
<i>You're gonna wait eight minutes
after what I told you?</i>

1326
01:42:39,251 --> 01:42:40,586
You leave right now.

1327
01:42:40,753 --> 01:42:41,795
<i>That is an order, okay?</i>

1328
01:42:41,962 --> 01:42:43,047
I'll get everybody out.

1329
01:42:43,213 --> 01:42:44,715
<i>Did you hear wh--?</i>

1330
01:42:44,882 --> 01:42:47,926
Gwen! Gwen! You Mother Hubbard.
Are you serious?

1331
01:43:04,443 --> 01:43:05,611
He's heading south.

1332
01:43:16,372 --> 01:43:18,374
Stand down now, or we will open fire.

1333
01:43:18,540 --> 01:43:20,292
You are surrounded. There is...

...l"IO BSCBPB

1335
01:43:22,252 --> 01:43:23,671
Go, go!

1336
01:44:25,607 --> 01:44:26,984
Clear!

1337
01:44:27,151 --> 01:44:28,277
Clear up top!

1338
01:44:30,112 --> 01:44:31,363
Clear, sir!

1339
01:44:31,530 --> 01:44:32,698
All clear here, sir!

1340
01:44:58,182 --> 01:44:59,725
Freeze!

1341
01:45:00,392 --> 01:45:01,560
Down on the ground.

1342
01:45:01,727 --> 01:45:03,187
Your hands behind your head.

1343
01:45:03,354 --> 01:45:04,980
Now!

1344
01:45:08,359 --> 01:45:09,818
Parker.

1345
01:45:11,695 --> 01:45:12,696
It's headed to Oscorp!

1346
01:45:12,863 --> 01:45:15,240
And your daughter's there right now.

1347
01:45:28,003 --> 01:45:29,296
You gotta let me go.

1348
01:45:43,894 --> 01:45:44,645
Hold your fire!

1349
01:45:51,735 --> 01:45:54,238
Well, Paul, if I didn't see it,
I wouldn't believe it.

1350
01:45:54,405 --> 01:45:56,824
I won't venture to say
what it is crawling up...

1351
01:45:56,991 --> 01:45:58,909
...the north side
of the Oscorp Tower...

1352
01:45:59,076 --> 01:46:02,329
...but clearly it is not human
and it is very, very strong.

1353

<i>Time remaining: one minute.</i>

<i>We're getting the latest details.

<i>...has called for

<i>...everything south of 54th Street.</i>

1360

<i>If you are south of 54th Street...</i>

1361
01:48:01,991 --> 01:48:04,451
<i>...you have to move out
of the area immediately.</i>

1362
01:48:13,919 --> 01:48:16,505
<i>Spider-Man appears
to be heading towards Oscorp.</i>

1363
01:48:16,672 --> 01:48:17,715
<i>He looks injured...</i>

1364
01:48:17,881 --> 01:48:20,551
<i>...and it's really not clear
if he's gonna make it.</i>

1365
01:48:20,718 --> 01:48:21,802
<i>That's the guy who...</i>

1366
01:48:21,969 --> 01:48:23,345
...saved my boy on the bridge.

1367
01:48:23,512 --> 01:48:24,888
Troy, they're clearing us out.

1368
01:48:25,055 --> 01:48:27,474
Something bad's
going down in Midtown.

1369
01:48:27,641 --> 01:48:30,227
Still friends with Matthews,
that crane operator on 6th?

1370
01:48:30,394 --> 01:48:32,313
- Yeah.
- Get him on the phone for me.

1371
01:48:32,479 --> 01:48:34,565
The cops are evacuating everybody.

1372
01:48:34,732 --> 01:48:36,942
Get him on the phone for me.

1373
01:48:54,543 --> 01:48:57,171
Hey, Charlie, get me Enrique:

1374

- You got it.
- Angelo, get your mug over here.

1375

<i>All tower cranes on 6th...</i>

1377

swing your jib arms over the avenue
Boom angles at 90 degrees.

- I have to get this to Spider-Man.
- Get in.

1384
01:51:49,593 --> 01:51:51,428
- It can stop the Lizard.
- Get in the car.

1385
01:51:51,595 --> 01:51:54,473
- You don't understand!
- Yes, I do.

1386
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:56,892
Your boyfriend
is a man of many masks.

All alone.

1397

Look at me. Stay with me.

- Help's on the way, okay?
- You need to...

1427
01:57:31,060 --> 01:57:34,563
You need to be gone

You're gonna make enemies.

So I want you to promise me
something, okay?

1438
01:58:09,682 --> 01:58:13,477
Leave Gwen out of it.

1439

There was a funeral.

...rifles and they made speeches.

1463
02:02:15,552 --> 02:02:17,513
Two of my teachers showed up.

1464
02:02:18,931 --> 02:02:20,307

Everyone was there but you.

1466
02:02:42,454 --> 02:02:44,581
Can't do this. Can't do this.

02:02:46,834 --> 02:02:48,877
I'm sorry. I can't...

1468
02:02:49,044 --> 02:02:50,462
What are you saying?

1469
02:02:50,629 --> 02:02:52,464
I can't see you any more.

1470
02:02:54,425 --> 02:02:55,884
I can't.

1471
02:03:21,493 --> 02:03:23,495
He made you promise, didn't he?

1472
02:03:27,499 --> 02:03:31,378
To stay away from me, so I'd be safe.

1473
02:03:57,863 --> 02:03:58,697
What a pretty...

1474
02:03:58,864 --> 02:03:59,740
...girl.

1475
02:03:59,907 --> 02:04:01,075
Yeah.

1476
02:04:01,241 --> 02:04:03,035
That's what Uncle Ben said.

1477
02:04:04,078 --> 02:04:05,746
Did you ask her out?

1478
02:04:09,500 --> 02:04:10,834
Why?

1479
02:04:11,919 --> 02:04:13,379
Can't.

1480
02:04:14,672 --> 02:04:16,048
Why?

1481
02:04:18,634 --> 02:04:20,344
I'm just no good for her.

1482
02:04:23,514 --> 02:04:26,976
Peter Parker, if there's
one thing you are, it's good.

1483
02:04:28,018 --> 02:04:29,186
Anyone has a problem...

1484
02:04:29,353 --> 02:04:31,063
...with that can talk to me.

1485
02:04:48,789 --> 02:04:51,834
<i>Peter, I know things have been...</i>

1486
02:04:52,001 --> 02:04:53,210
<i>...difficult lately...</i>

1487
02:04:53,377 --> 02:04:55,462
<i>...and I'm sorry about that.</i>

1488
02:04:55,879 --> 02:04:58,841
<i>I think I know what you're feeling.</i>

1489
02:04:59,008 --> 02:05:01,593
<i>Ever since you were a little boy...</i>

1490
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:06,181
<i>...you've been living with
so many unresolved things.</i>

1491
02:05:07,391 --> 02:05:09,685
<i>Well, take it from an old man:</i>

1492
02:05:10,269 --> 02:05:13,355
<i>Those things send us
down a road.</i>

1493
02:05:13,522 --> 02:05:14,606
<i>They make us...</i>

1494
02:05:14,773 --> 02:05:15,858
<i>...who we are.</i>

1495
02:05:16,108 --> 02:05:21,363
<i>And if anyone's destined for greatness,
it's you, son.</i>

1496
02:05:21,947 --> 02:05:24,366
<i>You owe the world your gifts.</i>

1497
02:05:24,950 --> 02:05:27,828
<i>You just have to figure out
how to use them.</i>

1498
02:05:28,370 --> 02:05:31,707
<i>And know that wherever
they take you...</i>

1499
02:05:31,874 --> 02:05:34,168
<i>...we'll always be here.</i>

1500
02:05:35,002 --> 02:05:37,588
<i>So come on home, Peter.</i>

1501
02:05:38,464 --> 02:05:40,299
<i>You're my hero.</i>

1502
02:05:40,466 --> 02:05:41,967
<i>And I love you.</i>

1503
02:05:50,392 --> 02:05:52,102
- What's up, Parker?
- What's up?

1504
02:05:52,269 --> 02:05:53,729
Hey. How's it going?

1505
02:05:54,688 --> 02:05:56,065
You coming along, man?

1506
02:05:57,650 --> 02:05:58,484
Cool shirt.

1507
02:06:00,361 --> 02:06:01,487
Yeah.

1508
02:06:01,654 --> 02:06:03,155
Dude's crazy.

1509
02:06:03,322 --> 02:06:04,698
But chicks dig him.

1510
02:06:07,493 --> 02:06:10,204
Come on, guys, you heard the bell.
Get to class.

1511
02:06:19,672 --> 02:06:22,549
<i>I had a professor once
who liked to tell his students...</i>

1512
02:06:22,716 --> 02:06:25,970
...that there were only 10 different plots
in all of fiction.

1513
02:06:26,929 --> 02:06:29,014
Well, I'm here to tell you
he was wrong.

1514
02:06:29,181 --> 02:06:30,599
There is only one:

1515
02:06:31,517 --> 02:06:33,018
"Who am I"?

1516
02:06:33,727 --> 02:06:35,646
Mr. Parker.

1517
02:06:35,813 --> 02:06:36,814
Tardy again.

1518
02:06:38,774 --> 02:06:40,609
At least we can always count on you.

1519
02:06:40,776 --> 02:06:43,529
Sorry, Miss Ritter,
won't happen again, I promise.

1520
02:06:43,696 --> 02:06:45,781
Don't make promises you can't keep.

1521
02:06:48,033 --> 02:06:50,202
Yeah, but those are the best kind.

1522
02:06:50,369 --> 02:06:52,204
Okay, class, open your books.

1523
02:06:52,371 --> 02:06:54,373
Let's begin on page one.

1524
02:09:49,631 --> 02:09:52,217
Hello, doctor.

1525
02:09:52,384 --> 02:09:53,719
Did you tell the boy?

1526
02:09:53,886 --> 02:09:54,928
Tell him what?

1527
02:09:55,095 --> 02:09:58,849
Did you tell the boy
the truth about his father?

1528
02:10:00,517 --> 02:10:01,393
No.

1529
02:10:01,560 --> 02:10:03,145
Well, that's very good.

1530
02:10:03,479 --> 02:10:04,563
So we'll let him be...

1531
02:10:04,730 --> 02:10:05,689
...for now.

1532
02:10:06,732 --> 02:10:08,817
You should leave him alone!
