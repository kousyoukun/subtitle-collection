1
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,270
You must remember, young thespians,
learning is never seasonal.

2
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:59,370
So, do allow the shimmering lights
of summer to refresh and illuminate

3
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,270
- your fertile young minds.
- What's she talking about?

4
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,290
The future greets you
with its magic mirror,

5
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:12,780
reflecting each golden moment,
each emboldened choice.

6
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,650
Dude, Miss Darbus
has snapped her cap.

7
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,000
Dude, you're actually listening?

8
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,090
Yes, Jason.

9
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,080
So, what was your favourite
summer memory, Miss Darbus?

10
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,950
Summers have passed fleetingly
since I was your age,

11
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,390
but I remember each
with poignant clarity.

12
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,010
Summer. Summer.

13
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,560
Summer.

14
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,440
Summer.

15
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,190
- Summer.
- Summer.

16
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,460
- Summer. Summer.
- Ashland Shakespeare Festival of...

17
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,100
- Summer. Summer. Summer.
- ... '88 leaps fondly to mind.

00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,710
My parents keep talking about
how much college is gonna cost.

97
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,450
Yeah, my folks are gonna match
whatever I make,

98
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,680
but I gotta get hired first.

99
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,050
Me, too. I'm saving up for a car,

100
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,810
so I can take that little hottie
on a proper date.

101
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,180
Gabriella.

102
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,540
I understand you've moved
every summer for the past five years,

103
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,570
and I'd hate to think today is goodbye.

104
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,630
No worries. My mom promised
I'm here until graduation next year.

105
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,210
Bless Mom's little heart.

106
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,980
Sharpay, we got off to a rough start,
but you really came through.

107
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,650
I mean, you helped me
with the winter musical.

108
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:00,950
I did?

109
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,220
Those vocal exercises?

110
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,340
See you.

111
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,060
Gabriella and I have
had, like, five job interviews,

112
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,060
but we keep getting beat out
by college kids.

113
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,430
Yeah, same here. I guess I'm back
in the babysitting business.

114
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,880
Hey, Martha. Hey, Taylor.

115
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,260
Hey, Kelsi, what are you planning
to do this summer?

116
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,330
Grow, write music. Grow.

117
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,140
Your summer activities consultant
has arrived.

118
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,730
Hopefully some of those activities
will include a job.

119
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,840
Hey, whatever happens, as long
as we're together, it's cool, right?

120
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,620
You promise?

121
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,870
Here's my promise.

122
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:02,370
- "T" as in Troy?
- Well, I... Yeah.

123
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,330
Hey, man, how's it going?
There you go, boss.

124
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,350
Hoops. Let's go.

125
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,900
Yeah, sure, sure.
We're not busy or anything. Let's go.

126
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,990
We could go to the movies,
download music.

127
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,460
Oh, I'm definitely teaching you
a twisted-flip on the skateboard.

128
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,400
Oh, and I have first-aid training,
so I can patch myself up afterwards.

129
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,880
All right!

130
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,880
"Going to movies, listening to music.

131
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,980
"And, golly, Troy,
I have first-aid training. "

132
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,890
Oh, please.

133
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,170
Oh. Come here, Kelsi.
I have a summer job for you.

134
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,520
At our country club.

135
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,260
Our rehearsal pianist
is evidently moving.

136
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,570
Or hiding.

137
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,580
- Pardon?
- Sounds great.

138
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,490
Cheer up, Shar, it's summer.

139
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,020
We can do whatever we want to.
Everything changes.

140
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,530
Ryan, who's the absolute primo boy
at East High?

141
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,840
I'd say Troy Bolton has that category
pretty much locked up, don't you think?

142
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,130
And East High's primo girl?

143
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,620
- Just answer the question!
- Gosh, you?

144
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:18,150
Troy, Sharpay.
Sharpay, Troy. Sharpay...

145
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,810
Shar.

146
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,420
- It just makes sense.
- Evidently not to Troy.

147
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,170
But it's summer, Ry.
Everything changes.

- Me, too.

158
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,960
I'll tell you what. I'm seeing moves
I didn't see last season.

159
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,540
- Keep it coming, guys!
- Yeah. What team?

160
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,750
Wildcats!

161
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,000
All right!

162
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,730
Yo, time for milk.

163
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,040
- So, guys, how's the job hunt coming?
- The big zero.

164
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,710
- Girlfriend alert.
- Talk to me.

165
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,780
This is Thomas Fulton,
General Manager

166
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,940
of Lava Springs Country Club
here in Albuquerque.

167
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,500
I understand you've been looking
for summer work.

168
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,770
Hey, Troy, does Gabriella
still remember your name,

169
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,020
or did she find somebody new
to karaoke with this summer?

170
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,160
That sounds fantastic, Mr Fulton.
But how did you get my name?

171
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,530
Well, we've always had
a student summer work programme

172
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,860
here at Lava Springs.
So, are you ready?

173
00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:00,340
Here's the thing. I know the most
amazing girl... I mean, student.

174
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,630
Straight A's, quintuple straight A's,

175
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,840
and it would be
so amazingly perfect if...

176
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,330
Man, he's really working someone.

177
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,510
It can't be Gabriella.
Whenever she calls, he just blushes.

178
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,850
Yeah, I never said that.

179
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,050
Yes!

180
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,690
- What's up, dog?
- Nothing. Nothing. Nothing!

181
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,280
Okay. I'll tell you what,
you guys stick together this summer,

182
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,160
you work on the game,
and we are talking back-to-back

183
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,520
- championships next fall.
- Yeah!

184
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,390
Can we all redirect this energy
by carrying in the groceries?

185
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,900
- Yes, Mrs Bolton.
- Yes, Mrs Bolton.

186
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Hey, we're kicking off another
hot summer here in Albuquerque.

187
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,450
So, for those cool enough
to have a convertible,

188
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,280
crank up the sound,
breathe that fresh air,

189
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,620
and say hello to summer!

190
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:11,050
Miss Evans, Mr Evans,
looking very sharp this summer.

191
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,600
Welcome back to Lava Springs.

192
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,390
Thank you, Charles.

193
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,030
Hi, boy!

194
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,420
Oh, can you find
some shade for my car?

195
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,320
- Even if we have to plant a tree.
- Fulton.

196
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,670
And may I say, welcome back.

197
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,600
It's good to be home.

198
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,050
Are the flyers ready?

199
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:39,790
This year we embossed the flyers
for the show.

200
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,300
Inspired.

201
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,900
I plan to limit member talent
auditions to 30 seconds each.

202
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,170
Amateur performers are very...

203
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,480
- Draining?
- Yes.

204
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,260
Understood.

205
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,980
And should I...

206
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:57,720
We be so fortunate as to win
the Star Dazzle Award again.

207
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,200
But where would we put it?

208
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,410
We're planning on expanding
the trophy case.

209
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,630
The designs are in my office.

210
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,440
- Fulton, you are so efficient.
- Well...

211
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,010
The staffing matter we discussed?

212
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,150
Done. With discretion.

213
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,630
Fabulous.

214
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,780
- Oh, stop it. Yes. Yes.
- Ryan!

215
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,540
- Sharpay!
- Girls.

216
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,770
Your chaise in its usual spot,
Miss Evans?

217
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,990
Thank you, Javier.

218
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,480
Emma, Jackie and Lea, east of me.

219
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,060
Oh, and you'll be a prince to angle our
chaises on the hour, as the sun moves.

220
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,450
Well, thanks to the kind words
from your mother last season,

221
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,030
I've been promoted.

222
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,010
But, no worries,
I'll make sure that the new lifeguard

223
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,050
is fully briefed
on just how you like things.

224
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,740
So, what's the theme of
the summer talent show, Sharpay?

225
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,720
- Redemption.
- Love it.

226
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,860
It was a very trying year, ladies.

227
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,840
My drama department
was invaded by outsiders,

228
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,860
singers coming from the chemistry lab
and locker room. Shocking, really.

229
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,320
Sis, we've got the pool, the entire club,
and the whole summer to enjoy it.

230
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,330
And the spa has been redone.

231
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,250
There's a guacamole facial and
a seaweed body scrub on the menu.

232
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
What could be more fabulous?

233
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,870
- More ice.
- Right away, Miss Evans.

...not!

288
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,910
Yeah!

289
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,360
I got you. I got you. It's okay.

290
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,700
- What are you doing here?
- I'm the new lifeguard.

291
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,070
Wait, are you a member here?

292
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:14,900
I told you to hire Troy Bolton,
not the entire East High student body!

293
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:19,880
You told me to hire Troy Bolton.
"Whatever it takes. "

294
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,510
Well, why didn't you warn me
about the rest of them?

295
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,550
I did discuss the matter
with the Lava Springs board, of course.

296
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,500
The board. You mean, our...

297
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,720
Mother!

298
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,810
Gabriella Montez and the Wildcats?
Mother, how could you?

299
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,700
Think of your future, kitten.

300
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,620
These are your school chums,
not the fuddy-duddy Lava Springs staff.

301
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,910
These are not my chums!

302
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,350
They'll steal my talent show.

303
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,850
And what fresh talent
you'll have for your summer show.

304
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,020
Mother, did you hear what I just said?

305
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,050
Ryan, talk to Mother.

306
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,710
- Hi, Mom.
- Ducky! How's my dashing boy?

307
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,220
Tell pumpkin if she worries too much,
she'll get frown lines.

308
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,640
Namaste.

309
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,580
- I want them out!
- But your mother specifically said...

310
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,540
Oh, don't mention
that backstabbing yogini to me!

311
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,630
If you can't fire them,
make them wanna quit.

312
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,250
I'm hoping Chef Michael's
gonna teach me

313
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,500
the art of Austrian flake pastry.

314
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,640
And Sharpay's gonna be
where I work every day.

315
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,920
How much better can summer get?
Right? Right?

316
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,380
- A real dream come true.
- If you actually get to know her,

317
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,630
- I mean she's...
- Dude.

318
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,290
Hey, I didn't even know
Sharpay's parents owned this place.

319
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,520
Mr Fulton just said, you know,

320
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,560
there's Wildcat fans at Lava Springs,
and jobs are available.

321
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,010
So, I said let's go for it.

322
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,590
Inspiring, Mr Bolton. Truly inspiring.

323
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,700
However, what we're looking for
from all of you,

324
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:15,580
is not inspiration, but perspiration.

325
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:22,330
Confirming assignments.
Bolton, Danforth, waiters.

326
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,930
And, when needed, caddies.

327
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:28,920
What?

328
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,210
Miss McKessie,
I'm told that you're efficient.

329
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,230
- Well...
- Prove it.

330
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,180
You'll handle member activities.
Keep me in sight at all times.

331
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,150
Kelsi, piano.
Lunchtime and cocktail hour.

332
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,720
That means mood music,
not new music.

333
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,190
Capisce?

334
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,840
Martha, chopping, cutting,
preparing plates.

335
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,360
Do complete the summer
with the equal amount of digits

336
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,820
I assume you currently possess.

337
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,790
Oh, Zeke, you will assist Chef Michael
in the...

338
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,370
The promised land.

339
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,700
You hold on to that.

340
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,400
Mr Fulton, Your Excellency, sir,

341
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:10,550
would it be okay if we draw straws
to see who has to wait on Sharpay?

342
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,880
Please, none of you
will be waiting on Sharpay.

343
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,380
Oh, yes. Snap.

344
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,480
- You will be serving Miss Evans.
- Who's that?

345
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:24,020
Always address our members as Mr,
Mrs, or Miss. Let's practise.

346
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,920
- Do we have to?
- Shall we?

347
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,140
"Miss Evans,
would you care for lemonade?"

348
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:32,400
Actually, I'm not Miss Evans. I'm Jason.

349
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,530
- It smells so good and I am so hungry.
- No, wait. You don't...

350
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,700
- No, no, no.
- What's for lunch?

351
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,190
Miss Montez.

352
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:45,340
It would seem your lunch break
does not start for 3.5 minutes.

353
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,640
I do hope no members drowned
in your absence.

354
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:52,800
Henceforth, do clock in
and out on time.

355
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:57,850
Three infractions of any kind,
and your employment is terminated.

356
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,800
Capisce?

357
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,160
Chop, chop, chop.

358
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,750
- Okay, that man officially scares me.
- Yeah.

359
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,670
Suddenly, I'm beginning to miss
detention with Miss Darbus.

360
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:10,700
- How sick is that?
- Come on.

361
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,930
We got a hoop out back,
two free meals a day,

362
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,270
and we only have to wear
these stupid outfits on duty.

363
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,730
All for one, and one for all. All right?

364
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,350
- This is our summer. Now, what team?
- Wildcats!

365
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,070
- What team?
- Wildcats!

366
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,250

Yeah, we can work it out.

417
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,010
Send the waiters right in.

418
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:48,160
Miss me? Of course you did.

419
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,110
Hey, you ever been on a golf course?

420
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,580
We're employees, Troy. Not members.
And I don't play golf.

421
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,920
Who said anything about golf?

422
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,870
Are you sure it's okay for us
to be out here?

423
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,620
Yeah, unless the jackrabbits turn us in.

424
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,100
So, how's kitchen duty?

425
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,200
Oh, you know, the team that
washes dishes together, wins together.

426
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,640
My mom said summer jobs look good
on college applications.

427
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:23,110
All part of the frightening concept
called "our future. "

428
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,850
Are you worried?

429
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,320
Hey, college costs a fortune.

430
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,770
My parents are saving pennies,
unlike the people at this place.

431
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,240
You're a cinch for a scholarship.

432
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:36,900
I'm only as good as whatever happens
next season. It's...

433
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,940
I always liked the idea of
being in charge of my future,

434
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,470
until it actually started happening.

435
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:44,070
So, let's just think about right now,

436
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:47,550
because I've never been in one place
for an entire summer,

437
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,250
and this means a lot to me,
especially being here with...

438
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:55,450
Such an outstanding peanut-butter
and-jelly-sandwich maker like me?

439
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:58,340
I want to remember this summer, Troy.

440
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,620
- Here, catch.
- Oh, I love this game.

441
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,090
- Ready?
- Go.

442
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:10,720
- Beautiful.
- Very nice! Oh. Your turn.

443
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,980
- You didn't catch a single one of them.
- You...

444
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,700
That was so bad.

445
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,820
Fulton, when I was
on the fourth fairway today,

446
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,170
it seemed bone dry.

447
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:27,960
Oh, no way!

448
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:33,670
Could you tell maintenance
to give it a little extra splash?

449
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,910
No way!

450
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,760
- May I have this dance?
- Why, of course you may.

451
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,530
Let's go then.

452
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:03,500
You are gonna get so wet!

453
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,900
Yeah!

454
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:15,130
Keep an eye on them tomorrow
and keep me posted.

455
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,400
Why are you smiling?

456
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:20,500
No worries, Ryan.
This is our turf, remember?

457
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:25,630
First a break-time infraction,
now frolicking on the golf course.

458
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,550
We are not off to an auspicious start,
are we, Miss Montez?

459
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,120
Actually, Mr Fulton, this was my idea,
so she's...

460
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:35,090
How gallant, but irrelevant.

461
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,440
We won't allow this to happen again,
will we?

462
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,020
Good morning, everybody.

463
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,140
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

464
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,110
- Smells good. That smells good.
- Hey, Martha.

465
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,950
- Hey.
- Hey, Jason.

466
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,400
- Hey, morning.
- What's up?

467
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:07,990
♪ Yeah ♪
♪ You are the music in me ♪

468
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,770
-Sounding good, Kels.
-Thanks.

469
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:13,440
Actually, I need to go get ready
for the ladies' luncheon.

470
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,750
Won't exactly be rocking out.

471
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,030
You know, I am so excited
about the club's talent show.

472
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,860
I mean, the employees
get to do a number,

473
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,740
and I have ideas for everyone.

474
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,970
You guys can sing the lead,

475
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,460
and maybe Zeke and Chad
can do backup,

476
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:26,720
and everyone can dance.

477
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,180
Big timeout on that one.

478
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,440
My singing career began and ended
with the East High Winter Musical.

479
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,040
I'm just here to make a cheque
and sneak in the pool after work.

480
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,990
That's... That's really it.

481
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,470
What was that
you were playing a minute ago?

482
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,340
Oh, it's... It's nothing. It's just nothing.

483
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,570
What's this?

484
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,940
Well, I was thinking
if you'd do the show,

485
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:49,320
that I wanted to be ready,
and I wrote this for you guys.

486
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,500

- Oh, I love that song.
- Great job, Kels.

540
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:25,770
Oh, I've got the talent show sign-up
sheet right here. Are you in?

541
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:33,740
Maybe we can work this out,
but only if we're all in this together.

542
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,700
Yeah!

543
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,380
This is going to be fantastic.

544
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:40,170
I'm going to coordinate rehearsal
to coincide with all of our schedules.

545
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:43,680
Goldenthroat, this is Jazz Square.
We may have trouble.

546
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,420
Now, it's an amazing song,
but Kelsi didn't write it for us.

547
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,740
Hi, Mom.

548
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,790
- Seaweed scrub, darling?
- Maybe later.

549
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,480
Ryan, it might be wonderful
if Troy participates in our talent show.

550
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,910
What? If he sings with Gabriella

551
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,740
then our whole show is going to be
the "Troy and Gabriella Show. "

552
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:02,890
I'm not certain Gabriella
is ideally suited

553
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,420
to help Troy realise his full potential
at Lava Springs.

554
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,400
Mommy, what time
is Daddy gonna be here?

555
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,640
We tee off at noon. Join us?

556
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,630
Love to.

557
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,670
Up. And how shall
we get to the food today, sir?

558
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,220
- I don't know, perhaps skipping.
- Very well then.

559
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:22,760
Shall we?

560
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:26,300
Hipty scouty, hipty skipty,
hipty skipty, hipty skipty...

561
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:30,010
Danforth, Bolton,
you're caddying today.

562
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,010
$40 a bag. You've been requested.

563
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:33,610
- What?
- By who?

564
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,510
Dude, who cares?
For $40, I'd caddy for Godzilla.

565
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,360
Close, very close.

566
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,830
Thank you.

567
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,030
- Thanks.
- Thanks, man.

568
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,400
Hey, boys! So, Troy, I thought
it was time for you to meet my parents.

569
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:54,690
Enchantee.

570
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,460
- Awesome.
- Hi.

571
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,860
Hello.

572
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,740
So, where's your dad?

573
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,990
Hi, Daddy!

574
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,950
Where's the first tee
and what's the course record?

575
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,990
I'm just kidding. I built the course
myself and I hold the record,

576
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,340
but who's counting? Princess.

577
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:37,240
- Son, you've been working out.
- Yoga.

578
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,370
Bring that around, there you go.
Quite a season you boys had.

579
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,010
Oh, Troy played
for the golf team, too, Daddy.

580
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:47,280
Oh, versatile. How about you, son?

581
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,780
- Baseball. Track and field.
- Outstanding.

582
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,240
Might come in handy the way
I play golf. Fair warning.

583
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,250
Fore!

584
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,190
- Brilliant, darling. Brilliant.
- Lovely.

585
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:10,160
Chad, you'll be caddying for Mother.
Troy, Daddy.

586
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,980
Daddy.

587
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,600
Bravo!

588
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,810
Brilliant. Let's take a walk.

589
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,670
- Is that a new outfit?
- Yes, just this morning. And yours?

590
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,780
This old thing? I got it last week.

591
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,010
Come on, Chad.

592
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,940
What do you think?

593
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:34,360
Well, it's 190 to the pin,
downhill lie, elevated green.

594
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,710
I'd go with a full five, sir.

595
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,670
Hi.

596
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,270
- Nice call.
- All right.

597
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,790
Princess, grab your pitching wedge.
This one's yours.

598
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,470
Thanks, Daddy.

599
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,230
Line it up.

600
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,870
That's my girl.

601
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,480
That girl needs to take up knitting.

602
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,430
Or some sport
where she can only injure herself.

603
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,670
- I'm in the sand.
- Me, too.

604
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:32,020
Knees, hips, shoulders, hat.
Good. Drill it.

605
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,220
Backboard.

606
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,940
Yes!

607
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,800
That's my boy.

608
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,060
- Where...
- I have no idea.

609
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:58,430
Gabriella! Dinner tonight?
Sneak a swim?

610
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,170
Troy!

611
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,030
- Oh, lovely, darling.
- Nice.

612
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,230
Daddy, why not let Troy try a shot?

613
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,470
- Of course. Of course.
- No, I shouldn't.

614
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,850
- Come on.
- Are you sure?

615
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,310
- Yeah!
- Yes, sir.

616
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:21,250
- Are you sure it's okay, Mr Evans?
- It sure is.

617
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,650
- Give it a ride.
- Thank you.

618
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,150
- Here you go, Daddy.
- Thank you, dear.

619
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,040
- That's a beautiful swing.
- Really beautiful.

620
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:37,310
That is a beautiful swing.

621
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,330
- That was awesome.
- Thanks, man.

622
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,620
- Come on! What do you say we...
- What? I don't know.

623
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,340
Off we go.

624
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:52,390
I'm saving up for a car.
I'm saving up for a car.

625
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,340
Well, Tiger Woods would
have been proud to make that putt!

626
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,520
What a shame that Troy
is only bussing dishes all summer,

627
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,110
given that he's a potential star
for your alma mater, Daddy.

628
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,420
I've seen Troy play basketball.

629
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,350
I think the U of A Redhawks
will be very interested in him.

630
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,110
That's inspired, Daddy.
Troy is very concerned about college.

631
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,510
- Really?
- Yeah.

632
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,840
- How's Coach Bolton these days?
- Oh, fantastic.

633
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,460
Outstanding.

634
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:37,980
What?

635
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:41,130
Oh, next time
I see Country Club Princess,

636
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:43,630
I'm gonna launch her and her pink cart
straight into the lake.

637
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,020
I'll build the ramp, buddy.

638
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,150
Danforth, this is a kitchen,
not a day spa.

639
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:51,010
You and Jason suit up for dinner duty
in the dining room.

640
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:54,490
Bolton, you have five minutes
to change and come with me.

641
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:57,310
In case you're not familiar
with this particular item,

642
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,420
it goes around your neck,

643
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,640
like a dog collar.

644
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,870
Chop-chop.

645
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:11,840
- And she stepped on the ball.
- I did not.

646
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:14,580
- Yes, you did.
- I can believe that.

647
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:18,890
Hey! Here's our superstar.
Troy Bolton, this is Peter.

648
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,480
- Peter. Good to meet you.
- How are you?

649
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,650
- This is Claire.
- Hello.

650
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,700
- And you know the family.
- Hello.

651
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:27,300
This kid's pretty handy on the fairways
as well as the hard court.

652
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,940
Bet you worked up yourself an appetite

653
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,720
lugging those bags
all over the place, huh?

654
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,910
Yeah, yeah. A little bit.

655
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,600
What do you say we get some food,
and we can talk about your future.

656
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,590
- My future?
- Yeah, sit down.

657
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,240
Have a seat.

658
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,220
Daddy's on the board of directors
at the University of Albuquerque.

659
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:45,660
So, Troy, I saw your
championship game. I mean, wow!

660
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:48,730
That last-second shot at the buzzer...
Outstanding.

661
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,170
Actually, my teammates here
stole the ball,

662
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:52,580
otherwise I wouldn't have
had a chance...

663
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,880
Oh, you're much too modest, Troy.

664
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:57,710
You were voted MVP
for the entire season.

665
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:03,520
This shirt positively screams
for a Windsor knot.

666
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,980
- Thank you.
- Let me get that for you.

667
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:13,970
You know, we've got a heck of
a basketball programme over at U of A,

668
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:16,120
and an excellent
scholarship programme as well.

669
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,620
Scholarship?

670
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,500
Yeah. You know,
between the two of us here,

671
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,750
we... We pull a little weight over
at the school.

672
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,390
Well, time flies when you're having fun,

673
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:32,520
but Mr Fulton will probably
want me clocking out.

674
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,180
Come on. Don't be silly.

675
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,960
You haven't had any dessert,
and we haven't talked about golf, yet.

676
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:40,300
Oh, basketball and golf are
just the beginning with Troy, Daddy.

677
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,090
Have you heard him sing?

678
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,910
Oh, triple threat.

679
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,190
Oh, how wonderful.
Troy can participate in the talent show.

680
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:50,490
Oh, come on, Troy.
Give them a sample. Kelsi!

681
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:53,980
Kelsi. No, actually my voice is...

682
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:56,810
Is feeling a little bit hoarse tonight,
you know, all the talking.

683
00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:00,440
But thank you very much for the food
and the golf and everything.

684
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,790
It was amazing.

685
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:06,720
But you will sing some other time,
though? With me. Promise?

686
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,900
- Promise.
- Perfect.

687
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,310
Dessert?

688
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,000
Sorry I'm late!
Give me two more minutes.

689
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:46,330
Nice tie. Your shoes
don't match though. Kidding.

690
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:57,420
Honey, two minutes is being late,
but an hour is approaching a felony.

691
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:00,410
Just because Troy's a nice guy, doesn't
mean he's immune to boy disease.

692
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:01,600
Boy disease?

693
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,140
Yeah, forgetting things
he shouldn't forget.

694
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,640
Oh, so now you're a boy expert?

695
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:07,580
My older sister has 10 rules
about boy behaviour,

696
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,460
and nine of them involve boys
forgetting things

697
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,220
they should never forget,
like dinner dates.

698
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,010
Well, it wasn't an official date
type of thing.

699
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,680
Rule number three,
all dates are official,

700
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,360
whether the boy knows it or not.

701
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:27,430
- You're not done.
- But I'm done for the day, sir.

702
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,590
And actually, I have a date.

703
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:30,840
Mr Bolton, you're under
the mistaken impression

704
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,930
I'm interested in what you have to say.
Just follow me.

705
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:36,140
- But I...
- No more speaking.

706
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:49,160
- Hey, where are we going?
- Please, Mr Bolton.

707
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:51,610
- How long is this gonna take?
- Watch your step. Insurance issues.

708
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:52,780
I'm supposed to have a date tonight.

709
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,720
But the evening is young
and so are you.

710
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,320
Well, where are we?

711
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,390
Hold your applause until the very end.

712
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:06,480

We'll talk about this later.

So, you love it?

766
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:42,660
Look, you ever tried just singing?

767
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:46,700
I mean, without all the lights and sets
and, like, backup people?

768
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,930
Well, it'd be much harder
to get applause that way.

769
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,790
I'm not talking about applause.

770
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,340
I'm talking about hanging out
with friends.

771
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,770
You know, doing nothing,
and singing for fun.

772
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:01,050
Wait a minute. Not doing anything.

773
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,360
That might work.
A dark stage, a single spotlight.

774
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:10,030
We break out of darkness
into the circle of light.

775
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:11,780
- Wait, "we"?
- No set, no frills.

776
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:13,810
- Oh, man.
- Simple.

777
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,410
Dramatic. Just you and me.

778
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:20,600
That is such a great idea, Troy.
We could do it at our club talent show.

779
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,250
Look, I'm here to work.

780
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,280
Sharpay, I already told you
being onstage really is your thing,

781
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:26,970
it's not mine.

782
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:30,210
It could be our thing.

783
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:33,890
Time out on that one, okay?
I've got an "our thing,"

784
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,600
it's with Gabriella, and...
And I'm very late for her, so I got to go.

785
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:39,910
- But the show could be so amazing...
- I love your shoes.

786
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:41,790
- You like them?
- I really do.

787
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,200
I bought them in New York.
I have them in nine colours.

788
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:50,660
Girls! Again from the top.

789
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:17,700
Hey, lifeguard!

790
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:22,420
You're crazy, Wildcat!

791
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:26,760
And so late, but I brought food,
a few little candles.

792
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:29,000
I'm good for a poolside picnic.
What do you say?

793
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:33,410
Zeke even made desserts.
But first, I dare you to jump in.

794
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,230
You know we're not supposed
to be in the pool. Club rules.

795
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,840
Cramp!

796
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:48,340
I need a lifeguard!
Rescue me! Rescue me!

797
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:51,430
Here I come!

798
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,140
Thanks for coming in. Follow me.

799
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:37,630
Oh, listen.

800
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:44,580
You know, right now, with you,

801
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:49,840
it's finally starting to feel like summer.

802
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:51,950
Yeah, it is.

803
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:57,160
The water bugs are back.

804
00:49:57,310 --> 00:50:00,350
Look, Mr Fulton, this was my idea,
she had nothing to do with it.

805
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:03,720
I generously overlooked
your previous break violation,

806
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:06,010
but then came the golf course jaunt,

807
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,830
and now this. Two strikes.

808
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:14,700
Don't get a third. Out of the pool.

809
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,630
Sharpay's dad let me play a few holes

810
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,550
and then invited me to dinner
with some U of A alumni.

811
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:25,750
Really?

812
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,520
And they were talking
about scholarships,

813
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,430
while Jason and Chad
were, like, serving me.

814
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:33,020
And getting paid for it. It's called a job.

815
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:34,820
You were invited,
nothing wrong with that.

816
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:37,130
Yeah. I don't know. It felt weird.

817
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:39,780
I love that you've got the team
working together,

818
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,620
but you're not gonna be
a Wildcat forever.

819
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:45,130
The team is now, and that's... It's good,

820
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,510
but everybody's got their own future.

821
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:50,010
I'm not sure I know what you mean.

822
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:54,180
Well, when you graduate,

823
00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:57,010
lots of people are gonna be
chasing the same opportunities.

824
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:59,850
There's nothing wrong with
keeping your eye on the prize.

825
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:02,040
In fact, if you don't, you get left behind.

826
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:04,770
Yeah, I know, I'm just saying,
I didn't get my friends jobs at the club

827
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:07,600
so they could sit and watch me
eat in the dining room.

828
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,630
You know, I'm just saying
never be ashamed of attention,

829
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,320
as long as you've earned it.

830
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:12,910
You know, a scholarship's special,

831
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:14,410
that's why there's only a few
to go around.

832
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,520
Yeah, yeah. I get it, Dad.

833
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:23,020
Okay. So, how was the food
at Lava Springs?

834
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,210
Insanely good.

835
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,120
- Take it out for a spin.
- No way.

836
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,590
Well, you didn't think I was going
to drive this heap, did you?

837
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:35,520
Yes! Yes!

838
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,910
Okay, bring those knees up as high
as you can and circle those arms.

839
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:42,360
Hey, water bug. Last night was so fun.

840
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:43,780
I really didn't mean
to get you in trouble.

841
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,400
Same here.

842
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:48,380
- So, maybe today we can have our...
- Troy?

843
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,930
What time is your lunch break?

844
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:54,090
Troy!

845
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:57,790
- 1:30.
- 1:30, great.

846
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:01,490
Free cheeseburgers are on me.
Everybody looks great. Awesome job.

847
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:03,800
Okay, now, some jumping jacks.

848
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:06,860
Hey. What is she up to?

849
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,920
- Who knows?
- Believe me, she does.

850
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:16,690
I'm sorry I'm late, Mr Fulton,

851
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:19,580
but about the pool thing last night,
you can't blame Gabriella...

852
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:21,620
- I'm promoting you.
- You're what?

853
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:24,180
There's an opening
as an assistant to the golf pros.

854
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:26,500
Salaried job, no clocking in.

855
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:29,980
- But, I...
- $500 a week, plus tips.

856
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,760
What? Per week?

857
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:38,070
Oh, my... That's off the hook!
I think it sounds very manageable.

858
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:40,710
Shall we?

859
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:46,100
Bolton!

860
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,630
- Wait. So you want me to teach golf?
- To kids. Oh, the joy.

861
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,520
- But, sir, I don't think I'm qualified.
- Worry not.

862
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,750
Simply show the little angels
which end of the club to hold,

863
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,070
tee the ball up, then duck.

864
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:06,730
In addition, the board is extending
membership privileges to you.

865
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:10,560
You have complete use
of club facilities, but do so prudently,

866
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,000
meaning, fellow Wildcats? Not.

867
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:18,410
Congratulations.

868
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:22,020
You'll find an appropriate choice
of clothing here.

869
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:24,510
Do not mix checks with plaids,
blue with browns,

870
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:27,570
and avoid wearing white socks
at all cost.

871
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,130
Leave your shoes outside the locker,

872
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,190
they will be buffed and polished
each evening.

873
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:35,880
Yes! Oh, man!

874
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,360
Save it for the first tee.

875
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:42,940
And to get there,
this might come in handy.

876
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:47,730
That's the key to your golf cart.
Number 14.

877
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:52,320
The same number that's on your
basketball uniform, so I'm told.

878
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,920
Questions?

879
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:55,770
How did this happen?

880
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:01,070
It would seem that the Evans family
thinks you have untapped potential.

881
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:06,380
Young man,
the future is full of uncharted waters,

882
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:11,160
and this family has real clout,
so I suggest you take the ride.

883
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:16,820
Yeah.

884
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:21,700
Italian.

885
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,670
Awesome, junior golfers!
You guys look amazing!

886
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,930
Hey! Hey! Slow down, champ.
Slow down.

887
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:31,900
Save some for the other kids.
There you go.

888
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:34,090
Cool shorts, buddy.

889
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:38,220
All right. Hey. Hey, cutie.
Try holding the club that way,

890
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,630
you're going to hit it way farther.

891
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:44,690
All right. Nice backswing, man.
Nice backswing.

892
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,500
Good job, killer. Make the ball fear you.

893
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,010
You look good. Great job, everybody.
Good job, guys!

894
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:53,060
- Bolton. Bolton. Your 11:30 is here.
- Thanks, man.

895
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,790
Good luck, buddy.

896
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,470
Troy!

897
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,510
Oh, man.

898
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:06,100
- Cool balls.
- Thanks.

899
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:07,320
You're welcome.

900
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:09,530
By the end of summer,
you'll have me playing like a pro.

901
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:10,780
Yeah.

902
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:14,570
If I live that long.

903
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:19,840
I'm so excited about the show.

904
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:23,080
Oh, and don't worry.
We'll find something great to do.

905
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:28,060
Look, Sharpay, I already told you,
singing really isn't my thing.

906
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:31,030
And here's the best news,
all the Redhawk boosters will be there.

907
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:33,140
- Really?
- Of course.

908
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:37,550
We'll lock up your scholarship
with a high "C" right from centre stage.

909
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:40,680
We're all in this together, right?

910
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:43,340
Your parents have been really,
really nice, Sharpay,

911
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,770
but singing with you
isn't a part of my job.

912
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,580
I know,
just something you promised to do.

913
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:51,110
Remember?

914
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:55,940
You look fabulous in your new clothes,
by the way.

915
00:55:56,130 --> 00:56:00,090
- You like the shoes? They're Italian.
- Nice.

916
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:05,580
Let me show you how this is done.
It's really easy.

917
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:09,840
Just line up to your target.
Nice, easy backswing.

918
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:12,330
- Hey, Gab.
- Hey!

919
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:21,860
That girl's got more moves than
an octopus in a wrestling match.

920
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:25,270
- Nah. He knows how to swim.
- Yeah. Troy can handle himself.

921
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:27,530
I did overhear him asking her
for her opinion

922
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:31,220
on his new Italian golf shoes.

923
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:32,650
He didn't ask me.

924
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,150
So, wake up, sister! She's basically
offering him a college education

925
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:38,450
just to sing with her in the talent show.

926
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:42,710
- Troy would never do that.
- You got eyes, use them.

927
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:46,490
- Let's go eat.
- Yeah, I got to go. Hey, see you later?

928
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:48,160
- Okay.
- Okay.

929
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:50,300
You're going to take it back
and through.

930
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:54,640
- Troy, Fulton wants you in the lobby.
- Fantastic. Thank you. See you.

931
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,260
And she steps on the ball.

932
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:12,790
- Troy Bolton. This is...
- I've seen them all play at U of A.

933
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,070
Oh, all right.
Well, come scrimmage at our gym.

934
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:17,210
It'll be good for your game.

935
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:20,260
- Play with you guys?
- Yeah. Let's get down, bro.

936
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:23,100
- Awesome.
- All right.

937
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:25,820
- Let's all get some awesome lunch.
- Yeah.

938
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:27,970
I knew it! Coral blue!

939
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:30,900
It's perfect for your skin tone.
And mine, too!

940
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:33,100
We are majorly skin-tone compatible,
Troy.

941
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:37,350
- I have no idea what that means.
- You don't need to. I'm here for you.

942
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:40,220
- Who's hungry?
- Let's eat.

943
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:43,630
I mean, how can you hit the ball
straight if your clubs don't trust you?

944
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:45,740
- That's the key. So, it's all in the grip.
- Okay.

945
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:48,870
You got to hold it just right.
That looks great.

946
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:51,120
Hey, I almost forgot.

947
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:52,650
I ordered Swiss on my burger.

948
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:54,990
So, go ahead and check it out, man.
Try it. See what you think.

949
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:57,920
Danforth, table three
needs more iced tea.

950
00:57:58,130 --> 00:57:59,770
Now, rotate your hands over the top.

951
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:01,240
- Put your thumb on that side.
- Okay.

952
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:03,740
There you go, man. You're good.
I'll see you on the course.

953
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:05,440
- Yeah. Let's do it, man.
- Yeah.

954
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:09,420
- Zeke! Troy wants Swiss.
- Coming right up.

955
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:10,710
You know, you were right.

956
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:12,520
There's a guy out there
that looks just like Troy Bolton,

957
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:15,120
but I have no idea who he really is.

958
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:26,950
Oh, hey.
Kelsi's got some great new ideas

959
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,760
- to spice up the talent show. It's got...
- I'm thrilled.

960
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:32,220
That new duet
that Troy and Gabriella sang? I need it.

961
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,810
- Actually, it's not available.
- Repeat.

962
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,230
Well, it's something I wrote
for Troy and Gabriella,

963
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:38,410
just in case they decide to...

964
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:43,300
You're an employee,
not a fairy godmother. Let's have it.

965
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:49,180
Transpose it into my key. Troy and I
will be doing it in the talent show.

966
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,310
Oh, and brighten up the tempo.
We'll need to keep people awake.

967
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,560
What about our song?

968
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:56,490
- What about Humu Humu?
- Change in plans.

969
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:59,330
What am I supposed to do
with my Tiki Warrior outfit?

970
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:02,800
Save it for Halloween, go to a luau,
sell it online. I don't know!

971
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:06,110
But in the meantime,
keep an eye on those Wildcats.

972
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:07,970
If they're planning on
being in the show,

973
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,480
which I doubt,
once they hear about Troy and me,

974
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:13,940
I don't want any surprises.
Oh, and don't worry,

975
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:17,290
I'll find a song for you
somewhere in the show.

976
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:19,620
- Or the next show.
- Really?

977
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,470
Don't strain yourself, slick.

978
00:59:26,770 --> 00:59:30,920
Entertainers are so temperamental.
Transpose!

979
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,510
Look at you.

980
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:47,450
- Go, team.
- Yeah. It's a gift from the guys.

981
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:53,420
The "guys"?
Oh, you mean all those tall people?

982
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:57,630
Yeah. Yeah.
Hey, look. I got to go in a minute,

983
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,400
but I'll be back in about an hour.
I'll pick you up in my new truck

984
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:02,900
and we'll go to a movie. I promise.

985
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,730
"Promise" is a really big word, Troy.

986
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:09,660
Yeah. I know.

987
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:12,320
And we've got
the staff baseball game after work.

988
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,190
Remember, you "promised"
that you'd play?

989
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,470
Right. Right. Baseball.
I will absolutely meet you there.

990
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:20,840
- You forgot, didn't you?
- No. I just got the date mixed up.

991
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:23,900
And I'm sorry
I couldn't make lunch today. I just...

992
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,430
It's been wild, you know?

993
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:28,730
I can't believe
how things are working out here.

994
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:34,150
So I see. Italian golf shoes,
new clothes, golf carts.

995
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:38,340
That's crazy stuff.
Hard to keep track of it all, I bet.

996
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,820
So, what's your point?

997
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:45,090
It just doesn't seem like new stuff,
it seems like a new Troy.

998
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:48,700
All right, let's see if Tiger Woods
still has a jump shot.

999
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:51,690
- Hey, hey, Bolton! Come on!
- Hey!

1000
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:53,410
Why don't you tell them
to come over here and mix it up?

1001
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:54,630
We'll show them some game.

1002
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:56,810
You know,
I don't think that's how they roll.

1003
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:58,130
That's not how they "roll"?

1004
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:02,030
No, no, no, that's not what I meant.
I just think it's a closed practice. Sorry.

1005
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,240
Wow. Well,
maybe you can get us a video?

1006
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:05,600
Bolton, come on!

1007
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:07,940
But yesterday you said we were
going to play two-on-two after work,

1008
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:11,710
- before the baseball game.
- I know. I know, man. I'm sorry.

1009
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:17,140
Come on, Zeke, that was so yesterday.
You know, when we were all on a team!

1010
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:19,270
- Hey, man.
- Hey, how's it going?

1011
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:22,070
Hey, Bolton! That's my ball.

1012
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:30,150
- Here we go!
- How's it going, guys?

1013
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:31,900
Would you guys be mad at me
if I ask him to get me

1014
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:34,420
one of those cool Redhawk jackets?

1015
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,880
Hey. Come on.

1016
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:47,660
I'm so excited about the game.
It's going to be so cool.

1017
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,780
Hey, Ryan. No rehearsals?

1018
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,830
My sister is working up something new.

1019
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:56,510
So, you coming to the baseball game?

1020
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:59,230
I'm not staff. Wasn't invited.

1021
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:02,410
Hey, everyone's invited.
Come on. Hop in.

1022
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:05,530
All right.

1023
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:08,160
Hold on!

1024
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:13,050
All right! Right here!

1025
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:20,300
Beep, beep!

1026
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:24,560
Beep, beep!

1027
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,240
What, did Fulton send you out here
to spy on us?

1028
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:29,560
Nah, my sister did.

1029
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,530
She thinks you guys are going to
upstage her talent show.

1030
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:33,740
Oh, no worries.
We were going to do the show,

1031
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,230
but then Troy bailed on us,
so, whatever.

1032
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,330
What do you mean "whatever"?
It's our summer, remember?

1033
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:41,580
I thought we decided
doing the show would be fun.

1034
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,160
- Well, I think so.
- Me, too.

1035
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,100
- Who are we kidding?
- I don't think so.

1036
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:46,660
We don't know
how to put together a show.

1037
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:49,190
No, but he does.

1038
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:53,380
If we have a real director
putting it together, it could be great.

1039
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,230
Have the employees ever won
a Star Dazzle Award?

1040
01:02:57,610 --> 01:02:59,720
- Hey, now...
- I know what you can do, Ryan,

1041
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:01,780
- so why not do it for us?
- All right, look,

1042
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:06,810
if you want to play ball,
then grab a mitt, but I don't dance.

1043
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:10,230
You don't think dancing
takes some game?

1044
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:16,530
- You got game?
- A little.

1045
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,860
Yes!

1046
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:35,930
Hey, pitcher. Ball.

1047
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,230
All right! Let's hustle!
Come on! Wildcats!

1048
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,870

It's okay!

1135
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:47,710
Hey, Evans.

1136
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:51,910
I'm not saying
I'm going to dance in the show,

1137
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:55,630
but if I did,
what would you have me do?

1138
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:07,060
Hey! Get back, get back!

1139
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:09,570
Here we go, here we go!
Defence, hold him tight!

1140
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:21,920
Oh, dang!

1141
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:24,670
This kid's good. I like what I'm seeing.

1142
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:28,060
Troy gives 110, 24/7,
that you can count on.

1143
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:29,560
Here we go!

1144
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:32,360
-Game. Game.
-Good game!

1145
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:39,780
Was I right?

1146
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:40,990
Great.

1147
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,680
All right,
so you call that a "little" game?

1148
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:56,010
Little League. World Series.
Newport, Rhode Island.

1149
01:08:57,730 --> 01:08:58,800
Champions.

1150
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:02,130
- Good job!
- Nice hat.

1151
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,620
- You're so awesome.
- Hey.

1152
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:05,850
What can I say?

1153
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:09,260
- Troy, you ready to run it back?
- Let's run it, man.

1154
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:10,680
- All right. Let's go, yo.
- Let's go.

1155
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:13,340
Let's go, yo, let's go. Let's run it back.

1156
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:24,010
- Looking good.
- Wow, Wildcat!

1157
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:28,340
- Too much?
- Only in daylight.

1158
01:09:28,590 --> 01:09:31,630
- Yeah.
- East High colours, very impressive.

1159
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:35,080
- Hey. Be true to your school, right?
- Absolutely.

1160
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:37,180
Everyone's excited
about doing the show.

1161
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:39,990
Hey, I know everyone thinks
that I'm Sharpay's poodle,

1162
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:42,100
- but I really think that I could...
- Hey.

1163
01:09:42,270 --> 01:09:46,030
If they were thinking that,
they're not thinking that today.

1164
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:48,530
How do you do that swing-step
you did last night?

1165
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:50,050
That's easy.

1166
01:09:52,410 --> 01:09:53,440
Hey.

1167
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:56,370
- Hey.
- Hey.

1168
01:09:57,750 --> 01:10:01,660
So, I called last night.
I got hung up at the gym.

1169
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,680
Hey, my dad says you're doing great
with those college guys.

1170
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,760
Oh. Yeah. They're awesome.

1171
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:10,640
Playing with them is like being
in another world.

1172
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,840
Well, you missed out on a fun night.
It was a great game.

1173
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,030
But the dessert afterwards
had to be the best part.

1174
01:10:19,230 --> 01:10:21,260
Her mom makes the best brownies

1175
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:24,590
- in the entire world.
- Yeah, I know. I've had them.

1176
01:10:28,030 --> 01:10:30,220
Well, I'll see you guys later.

1177
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,920
Hey, LeBron,
how'd it go with the Redhawks?

1178
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:49,680
You know, they're very tall.

1179
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,750
We got Vince from maintenance
to play, so it worked out.

1180
01:10:51,930 --> 01:10:54,490
- In case you were wondering.
- Maybe we could play later today.

1181
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,160
I don't know. Check with Vince.

1182
01:10:56,310 --> 01:10:58,500
Well, Mr Evans set up the workout,
not me.

1183
01:10:58,690 --> 01:11:01,150
Did you even ask to include us,
Captain?

1184
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:05,140
I didn't go looking for the Redhawks,
the Redhawks came to me. Okay?

1185
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:09,230
I didn't sign up for this golf job,
Fulton offered it. I said yes.

1186
01:11:09,490 --> 01:11:13,080
My decision. But I show up to work
same as you, so chill, man.

1187
01:11:13,330 --> 01:11:14,650
You get a speck of dirt on your pants,

1188
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:16,980
- and someone dry cleans you.
- And you wouldn't do the same thing...

1189
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:18,310
- If I was as good as you?
- I did not say that.

1190
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:20,010
- You didn't have to!
- And neither did you!

1191
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:22,890
You know what? We didn't vote you
captain because of your jump shot.

1192
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:26,080
Okay, we did it because you're the guy
who usually knows what's up.

1193
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:28,730
- But I guess things change.
- You think you got me all figured out?

1194
01:11:28,930 --> 01:11:30,960
Well, I don't think so.
And I don't answer to you.

1195
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:34,210
Then maybe you should
start answering to yourself!

1196
01:11:34,430 --> 01:11:37,790
Look, we have been like brothers
since pre-school.

1197
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:40,740
If I don't know who you are these days,
then who does?

1198
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:46,380
Excuse me. You're all being paid
to work, not play Dr Phil. Chop-chop.

1199
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:53,420
Table settings, nice. Oh. No, no.

1200
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:59,590
No. No. No. Now, that? Fabulous.

1201
01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:00,940
Troy!

1202
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,800
Daddy will make certain the entire
scholarship committee is right here.

1203
01:12:06,010 --> 01:12:07,320
Perfect view.

1204
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:09,020
I've already spoken to your mother.

1205
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:11,560
They're going to be sitting at a table
right next to ours.

1206
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,350
It's going to be a fabulous evening.

1207
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:15,260
- Come on.
- Great.

1208
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:17,420
Rehearsal, everyone!

1209
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:18,990
- Taylor, I'm signing off on everything.
- Fabulous!

1210
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:20,500
- Thank you, Mrs Evans.
- Good job.

1211
01:12:20,650 --> 01:12:24,240
Look, Sharpay. I know I promised
I'd do this, but just take it easy on me.

1212
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:27,920
I'm kind of new
to the whole performing thing.

1213
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:29,990

Great rehearsal!

1244
01:14:58,180 --> 01:14:59,740
Everybody break!

1245
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:06,450
You know, Troy,
I've always known you were special.

1246
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:09,850
And it's pretty obvious I'm special, too.

1247
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:13,140
I think we were meant to sing together,
don't you?

1248
01:15:18,450 --> 01:15:20,010
I need some air.

1249
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:25,170
Don't be long!
We're going to run it again!

1250
01:15:48,030 --> 01:15:49,580
Show me what you got!

1251
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,480
Come on, everybody! Here we go!

1252
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:06,760
You're up! You're up! You're up first!

1253
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:10,060
Here we go! Give it to me!

1254
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:12,210
Come on! Oh, yeah!

1255
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:16,390
You got it! Here we go!
Pass it to me!

1256
01:16:16,850 --> 01:16:19,240
Come on, let's dance!

1257
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,120
You're up! You're up!

1258
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:27,530
Let's show them what we got!

1259
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:32,490
Come on! All right!

1260
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:39,570
Oh, cut that! Get out of here!

1261
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:47,170
- You got it! Hey.
- Good job!

1262
01:16:49,470 --> 01:16:50,980
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1263
01:16:56,850 --> 01:17:00,360
I said keep an eye on them,
not turn them into the cast of Grease!

1264
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,160
Pretty cool, huh?

1265
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:08,030
Do you want us to lose the Star Dazzle
Award to a bunch of dishwashers?

1266
01:17:09,570 --> 01:17:12,680
Us? Well, I guess that's showbiz.

1267
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:18,580
When did you become one of them?

1268
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:22,770
You know,
I'll take that as a compliment.

1269
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:26,520
But you and Troy
have a good show, sis.

1270
01:17:26,790 --> 01:17:28,940
Oh, we plan to.

1271
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:41,820
Give me a beat.

1272
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:53,100
The Midsummer's Night Talent Show
means something to me,

1273
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:54,350
- and to my family.
- Well...

1274
01:17:54,490 --> 01:17:56,640
Those Wildcats will turn it into a farce.

1275
01:17:56,820 --> 01:18:00,860
I'm... Your brother is one of
"those Wildcats," I'm told.

1276
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,840
Oh, don't you mention that traitor to us.

1277
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:06,470
Employee involvement in the show
is a tradition here.

1278
01:18:06,670 --> 01:18:10,380
Traditions change. My parents have
important guests coming.

1279
01:18:10,630 --> 01:18:13,780
We'll need every employee working
the party, and not on stage.

1280
01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:17,000
Pardon moi, but
we're not just talking about employees,

1281
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:22,580
we're talking about your classmates.
You might want to think this one out.

1282
01:18:22,890 --> 01:18:24,610
All right.

1283
01:18:25,730 --> 01:18:28,040
Done. Now do it.

1284
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:36,840
- Hi, Taylor.
- Hi.

1285
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:45,350
Distribute these in the staff area,
but not until the end of shift.

1286
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:49,820
- What? Wait! Mr Fulton...
- No discussion, Miss McKessie.

1287
01:18:50,090 --> 01:18:54,290
This is a business.
Welcome to the world of adults

1288
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:58,430
who wish to keep their jobs because
they have mortgages they wish to pay,

1289
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:01,800
tuition bills, car payments,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1290
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:04,770
So, sometimes, we have
to perform tasks, however unpleasant,

1291
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:07,490
that are necessary
for that all-too-important paycheque

1292
01:19:07,690 --> 01:19:10,200
to land in our all-too-empty pockets!

1293
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:17,660
- May I get you a cup of tea, Mr Fulton?
- Chamomile would be lovely.

1294
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:27,980
- Go, Martha! Go, Martha!
- Go, Martha! Go, Martha!

1295
01:19:28,290 --> 01:19:29,520
May I have your attention, please?

1296
01:19:29,670 --> 01:19:32,140
You guys,
I need to make an announcement.

1297
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:35,810
All junior staffers will be required
to work on show night.

1298
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:37,370
- What?
- Yeah, it says,

1299
01:19:37,510 --> 01:19:41,030
"No staff participation in the show
will be allowed. No exceptions. "

1300
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:43,780
- No show?
- There's a show. We're just not in it.

1301
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:45,130
That's great.

1302
01:19:45,270 --> 01:19:48,180
I'm sorry, you guys. There's nothing
we can do about it. It's Fulton's orders.

1303
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,470
There's no way this is Fulton's idea.

1304
01:19:50,650 --> 01:19:54,880
Unless Fulton suddenly has blonde
hair and wears designer flip-flops.

1305
01:19:55,150 --> 01:19:56,470
Excuse me.

1306
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:09,270
- Totally!
- Sharpay!

1307
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:17,130
Forget about the rest of us,
how about the fact

1308
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:19,660
that your brother has worked
extremely hard on this show?

1309
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:24,520
Oh, boo-hoo. He'll be in the show.
He'll do his celebrity impersonations.

1310
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:27,280
And don't lecture me about Ryan,

1311
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:29,440
given the way you've been interfering
with Troy's future.

1312
01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:30,640
What?

1313
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:33,940
You've gotten him written up by Fulton
for sneaking on the golf course,

1314
01:20:34,150 --> 01:20:38,700
swimming after hours.
I had to step in just to save Troy's job.

1315
01:20:38,990 --> 01:20:41,510
I'm not interested in what you think
you're doing for Troy.

1316
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:44,820
That's between you and him.
But you're messing with my friends,

1317
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:48,030
my summer,
and that's not okay with me.

1318
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:51,370
You don't like the fact that I won.

1319
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:55,220
What's the prize? Troy?
The Star Dazzle Award?

1320
01:20:55,470 --> 01:20:58,140
You have to go through all of this
just to get either one?

1321
01:20:58,350 --> 01:20:59,490
No, thanks, Sharpay.

1322
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:02,280
You're very good at a game
that I don't want to play,

1323
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:04,230
so I'm done here.

1324
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,240
But you better step away
from the mirror

1325
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:10,470
long enough to check the damage
that will always be right behind you.

1326
01:21:15,950 --> 01:21:17,060
Girls!

1327
01:21:21,450 --> 01:21:24,360
Hey.
What do you mean you're done here?

1328
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:26,250
I mean, you can't quit.

1329
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:32,050
Us working together sounded good,
but plans change and people change.

1330
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:34,570
The club talent show is a big deal
for Sharpay,

1331
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:37,720
and evidently for your future,
so it's cool.

1332
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:38,960
Just make it happen.

1333
01:21:39,090 --> 01:21:42,370
- Wear your new Italian shoes.
- Hey, I'm still me.

1334
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,590
Blowing off your friends,
missing dates?

1335
01:21:44,770 --> 01:21:46,520
- If that's you, it's good to know.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1336
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:49,200
I was only doing that because
I'm working on the scholarship thing.

1337
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,630
You know that.

1338
01:21:50,770 --> 01:21:52,570
But if along the way
you act like someone you're not,

1339
01:21:52,730 --> 01:21:54,250
pretty soon that's who you become.

1340
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:58,440
I meant what I said about movies
and summer and just being together.

1341
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:00,850
I'm sure you did, at the time.

1342
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:07,940
But I also meant what I said,
that I want to remember this summer.

1343
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:10,160
But not like this, Troy.

You're usually taking these
right off the grill.

1390
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:42,740
Maybe I've been eating too much
at the club.

1391
01:25:42,890 --> 01:25:44,960
You've barely been out of this room
the last three or four days.

1392
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:48,450
- Let's call the guys, get a game going.
- They wouldn't come even if I called.

1393
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:51,800
I find that hard to believe.

1394
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:56,890
Dad, do I seem different
to you this summer?

1395
01:25:57,190 --> 01:25:58,990
You dress a lot better, that's for sure.

1396
01:25:59,150 --> 01:26:03,670
Oh, man, I'm serious.
Maybe my friends are right,

1397
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:06,390
maybe I'm turning into a jerk
with new shoes.

1398
01:26:06,580 --> 01:26:09,220
New shoes, not a new kid.
Where's this coming from?

1399
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:12,130
I've been so focused on my future.

1400
01:26:12,330 --> 01:26:15,800
I mean, Gabriella quit.
Chad won't talk to me.

1401
01:26:16,050 --> 01:26:17,600
I don't see the Wildcats
running around here.

1402
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:19,270
Is this about going after
what you want?

1403
01:26:19,430 --> 01:26:22,540
Yeah, Dad.
The scholarship's important. I get it.

1404
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,830
Hey, hey.

1405
01:26:25,010 --> 01:26:27,850
Look, it's only a big deal
if it makes sense to you.

1406
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:30,490
I don't even know who I am any more.

1407
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:36,750
You know what?

1408
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:40,780
I've known this kid for a long, long time.

1409
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:45,820
And I got a lot of faith in him.
He looks a lot like you.

1410
01:26:47,330 --> 01:26:52,360
I'm absolutely sure he's going
to figure out the right thing to do.

1411
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:58,110
It's so good. I cannot wait.

1412
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:04,630
Yeah, I'm eating so much breakfast,

1413
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:07,480
I won't be able to eat my dinner
at night.

1414
01:27:07,770 --> 01:27:09,800
Oh, yeah. It's okay, Ryan's gonna help.

1415
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:12,650
- I don't know.
- We'll get it eventually.

1416

01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:09,910
What do you mean
you're not doing the show?

1472
01:31:10,060 --> 01:31:12,250
- Exactly that.
- We're singing a duet, Troy!

1473
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:14,110
A duet means two people.

1474
01:31:14,270 --> 01:31:16,100
Well, mostly me in this case,
but whatever! Duet!

1475
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:18,870
I'm an employee.
Employees aren't allowed in the show.

1476
01:31:19,070 --> 01:31:21,460
No, no, no, no. No, no.
You're an honorary member.

1477
01:31:21,650 --> 01:31:22,800
Not any more.

1478
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:24,980
- I asked Fulton for my kitchen job back.
- What?

1479
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:28,430
Sharpay, I don't like the way
you've been treating my friends.

1480
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:30,410
And I don't like the way
I've been treating them either,

1481
01:31:30,580 --> 01:31:32,530
so I'm doing something about it.

1482
01:31:32,710 --> 01:31:37,180
An entire table of University boosters
are coming to see you, thanks to me.

1483
01:31:37,460 --> 01:31:39,420
So, I'll be their waiter.
They'll be thrilled.

1484
01:31:39,590 --> 01:31:41,580
Troy, Troy. This could change your life!

1485
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:44,590
I'm more interested in
about what my friends think of me,

1486
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,320
and what I think of myself.

1487
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:49,350
Oh, we could all hold hands
around the campfire some other time!

1488
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:50,790
Right now we've got a show to do.

1489
01:31:50,930 --> 01:31:55,130
No. You've got a show to do.
I got a kitchen to clean.

1490
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:01,260
It's okay.

1491
01:32:05,570 --> 01:32:07,370
Kelsi, find Ryan.

1492
01:32:09,950 --> 01:32:12,150
Welcome this evening.
You'll be seated at table 21.

1493
01:32:12,330 --> 01:32:15,880
Kelly, will you escort them, please?
Excellent.

1494
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:17,160
Ladies, you look gorgeous

1495
01:32:17,290 --> 01:32:20,130
- this evening. Beautiful.
- And now, returning with

1496
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:24,490
a abridged version
of last year's tap-dancing epic,

1497
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:28,200
Tina and her Tippety-Tappity Toes!

1498
01:32:39,530 --> 01:32:41,560
There you are! Thank goodness
you've come to your senses.

1499
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:43,490
Plug in the volcano.
Humu Humu is back on.

1500
01:32:43,650 --> 01:32:47,120
Enjoy your pineapple on your own, sis.
I'm not doing the show.

1501
01:32:47,370 --> 01:32:50,480
What? Oh, put some fresh batteries
in your Tiki Warrior costume

1502
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:53,140
- and let's get going!
- Took your advice. Sold it online.

1503
01:32:53,330 --> 01:32:58,090
You've always wanted the spotlight.
Now you've got it. Break a leg.

1504
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:06,590
The curtain's up. Showtime!

1505
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:22,020
Kelsi told us what went down
between you and Sharpay.

1506
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:25,830
I'm more interested in what went down
between me and you, man.

1507
01:33:26,070 --> 01:33:28,980
- I was a jerk.
- Yeah.

1508
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:31,590
But, hey, brothers fight.

1509
01:33:31,790 --> 01:33:34,380
And they're still brothers.

1510
01:33:37,130 --> 01:33:38,240
All right!

1511
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:42,500
Guys, I messed up your show
and I'm sorry.

1512
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:46,750
Yeah, because show business
is our entire lives, right?

1513
01:33:47,010 --> 01:33:49,680
Hey, I hope you haven't permanently
filled my spot in the two-on-two game.

1514
01:33:49,890 --> 01:33:52,930
And, Ryan, I know how hard
you must've worked on this show.

1515
01:33:53,140 --> 01:33:55,290
Making these Wildcats look good
couldn't have been easy.

1516
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:58,630
- Hey.
- So, I apologise.

1517
01:33:58,860 --> 01:34:01,420
Hey, the truth is,
we've all had a lot of fun.

1518
01:34:01,610 --> 01:34:02,640
At least, I have.

1519
01:34:02,780 --> 01:34:06,770
Hey, you gotta see
this dude play baseball.

1520
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:08,990
I'm looking forward to it.

1521
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:12,510
- All right!
- Yeah!

1522
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:15,540
Troy, listen, all these people out there,

1523
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:18,790
I don't really want
to see my sister crash and burn.

1524
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,040
At least, I think I don't.
I think you should sing with her.

1525
01:34:26,890 --> 01:34:31,400
My life is over. I've been a good girl.

1526
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:34,830
I've never lied, except when necessary.

1527
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:37,420
I always bought my parents
expensive gifts,

1528
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:41,360
using their credit card, of course.
But I don't deserve this humiliation!

1529
01:34:41,610 --> 01:34:45,810
You need to get out there.
Mrs Hoffenfeffer and her sock puppet

1530
01:34:46,070 --> 01:34:49,150
are stinking up the premises.

1531
01:34:49,370 --> 01:34:51,800
Well, the only thing that
would make it any lovelier would be

1532
01:34:51,990 --> 01:34:56,470
that if I won that Star Dazzle Award!
Sharpay, I'm going to find you.

1533
01:34:56,750 --> 01:35:01,030
That award, I tell you, it's mine!
Mine! Mine!

1534
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:06,010
Mirror, mirror on the wall. Who's the...
Oh, forget it.

1535
01:35:08,510 --> 01:35:11,660
How's your show going?

1536
01:35:11,890 --> 01:35:13,560
How's it going?

1537
01:35:13,730 --> 01:35:14,920
My show makes the captain
of the Titanic

1538
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:17,370
look like he won the lottery.

1539
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:20,950
- I'll sing with you, Sharpay.
- What?

1540
01:35:21,190 --> 01:35:24,310
I promised. And I keep my promises.

1541
01:35:24,530 --> 01:35:28,760
But what was the first thing you said
to me when I started working here?

1542
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:33,710
- Bring me more iced tea?
- Think harder. We're...

1543
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:40,500
- All in this together.
- Exactly.

1544
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:43,550
Well, we are.

1545
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:46,400
So, let's get out there
and knock them dead, Troy Bolton!

1546
01:35:46,590 --> 01:35:50,470
I do the show
if the Wildcats do the show.

1547
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:56,520
And I'd think fast.

1548
01:35:56,690 --> 01:35:59,410
I just sort of wish
you were doing this for me.

1549
01:36:01,780 --> 01:36:03,690
You're a good guy, Troy.

1550
01:36:06,030 --> 01:36:10,740
And actually, right now, I think
I like you better than I like myself.

1551
01:36:11,030 --> 01:36:12,750
Did I just say that?

1552
01:36:17,870 --> 01:36:20,150
Girls! Places!

1553
01:36:40,070 --> 01:36:44,580
- Okay. Everyone. Ryan, the show's on.
- Where's the music? Where's Troy?

1554
01:36:44,860 --> 01:36:46,610
Talked to Sharpay, everything's cool.

1555
01:36:46,780 --> 01:36:50,770
Hey, speaking of my sister,
she wants you to learn a new song.

1556
01:36:51,030 --> 01:36:54,070
Everyday. I can't learn a new song!

1557
01:36:54,290 --> 01:36:57,080
- Kelsi will help you with it.
- What?

1558
01:36:57,290 --> 01:36:59,600
- It's showtime!
- Yeah!

1559
01:36:59,790 --> 01:37:04,670
- What team?
- Wildcats!

1560
01:37:15,690 --> 01:37:18,760
Once in a lifetime

1561
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:22,370
And now it's time for our five-time

1562
01:37:22,610 --> 01:37:25,730
Star Dazzle Award winner,
Miss Sharpay Evans,

1563
01:37:25,950 --> 01:37:31,020
singing this year with
our assistant golf pro, Mr Troy Bolton.

1564
01:37:33,490 --> 01:37:35,480
Where is Troy?

1565
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:39,450
- Hey. Why did you switch songs?
- Switch songs? What?

1566
01:37:39,710 --> 01:37:42,860
- Yeah, Ryan said...
- Bolton!

1567
01:37:43,090 --> 01:37:47,130
- But I didn't learn a new song.
- Exactly.

1568
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:53,830
