1
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,932
- Hello, Mrs. MacGruder.
- Hello, Miss Daniels.

2
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:35,130
Have you ever seen so many gulls?
What do you suppose it is?

3
00:02:35,205 --> 00:02:39,198
There must be a storm at sea.
That can drive them inland, you know.

4
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,802
I was hoping you'd be a little late.
He hasn't arrived yet.

5
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:45,006
- But you said 3:00.
- I know.

6
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:47,745
I know. I've been calling all morning.

7
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:50,048
Oh, Miss Daniels, you have no idea.

8
00:02:50,154 --> 00:02:52,918
They are so difficult to get.
Really, they are.

9
00:02:53,023 --> 00:02:55,821
We have to get them from India
when they're baby chicks, and then...

10
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,826
This one won't be a chick, will he?

11
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:02,160
Oh, no, certainly not.
This will be a full-grown mynah bird.

12
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:06,135
- And he'll talk?
- Well, yes, of course he'll...

13
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:09,662
Well, no, you'll have to teach him to talk.

14
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:13,800
I guess maybe I'd better phone.
They said 3:00.

15
00:03:13,911 --> 00:03:16,675
Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call.

16
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,216
- Would you mind waiting?
- Well, maybe you'd better deliver him.

17
00:03:20,317 --> 00:03:22,308
Let me give you my address.

18
00:03:22,386 --> 00:03:24,911
Oh, well, all right,

19
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:27,685
but I'm sure they're on the way.

20
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,419
Would you mind if I called?

21
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:32,427
No. All right.

22
00:03:50,014 --> 00:03:52,744
- I wonder if you could help me.
- What?

23
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,410
I said, I wonder if you could help me.

24
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:02,349
Yes. What is it you're looking for, sir?

25
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:03,949
Lovebirds

26
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:05,858
- Lovebirds, sir?
- Yes.

27
00:04:05,963 --> 00:04:07,590
I understand there are different varieties.

28
00:04:07,698 --> 00:04:09,996
- Is that true?
- Well, yes, there are.

29
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,967
Well, these are for my
sister for her birthday,

30
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:16,198
and as she's only gonna be 11,
I wouldn't want a pair of birds...

31
00:04:16,306 --> 00:04:18,968
that were... too demonstrative.

32
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,102
- I understand completely.
- At the same time,...

33
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,146
I wouldn't want them to be too aloof.

34
00:04:23,213 --> 00:04:25,204
No, of course not.

35
00:04:25,315 --> 00:04:28,216
Do you happen to have a pair of
birds that are... just friendly?

36
00:04:28,318 --> 00:04:33,119
Oh, I think so. Now, then, let me see.

37
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:38,794
Aren't those lovebirds?

38
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:42,526
No. Those are, uh... red birds.

39
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:45,033
I thought they were strawberry finches.

40
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:47,626
Yes. We call them that too.

41
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,804
Here we are. Lovebirds.

42
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,378
Those are canaries.

43
00:04:55,412 --> 00:04:57,812
Doesn't this make you feel awful?

44
00:04:57,848 --> 00:05:00,214
Doesn't what make me feel...
Having all these poor, innocent ...

45
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,445
...creatures caged up like this?

46
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:06,546
- Well, we can't just let them
fly around the shop.
- I suppose not.

47
00:05:06,657 --> 00:05:10,889
Is there an ornithological reason
for keeping them in separate cages?

48
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:13,259
Certainly. It's to protect the species.

49
00:05:13,297 --> 00:05:15,891
Yes, that's important,
especially during the molting season.

50
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:18,662
That's a particularly dangerous time.

51
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:22,136
- Are they molting now?
- Oh, some of them are.

52
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:25,073
How can you tell?

53
00:05:25,175 --> 00:05:29,373
Well, they... get a
sort of hangdog expression.

54
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:35,077
Yes, I see. Well,
what about the lovebirds?

55
00:05:35,185 --> 00:05:37,415
Are you sure you wouldn't
like to see a canary instead?

56
00:05:37,488 --> 00:05:41,515
- We have some very nice
canaries this week.
- All right.

57
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:46,194
All right. May I see it, please?

58
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:00,709
Oh! Oh!

59
00:06:01,845 --> 00:06:03,938
What is it? Oh! Oh!

60
00:06:05,382 --> 00:06:07,942
Oh! Oh! Oh!

61
00:06:08,852 --> 00:06:11,787
Oh! Oh!

62
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,263
There we are.

63
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,288
Oh, there. Wonderful.

64
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:27,860
Back in your gilded cage, Melanie Daniels.

65
00:06:29,373 --> 00:06:31,671
What did you say?

66
00:06:31,775 --> 00:06:34,073
I was merely drawing a parallel,
Miss Daniels.

67
00:06:34,178 --> 00:06:37,773
- How did you know my name?
- A little birdie told me.

68
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:40,315
Good day, Miss Daniels. Madam.

69
00:06:40,384 --> 00:06:44,582
Hey, wait a minute. I don't know you.

70
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:47,215
- Ah, but I know you.
- How?

71
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,814
We met in court.

72
00:06:48,926 --> 00:06:51,417
We never met in court or anyplace else.

73
00:06:51,528 --> 00:06:54,588
- That's true. I'll rephrase it.
I saw you in court.
- When?

74
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:56,724
Don't you remember one of your practical...

75
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,791
...jokes that resulted in
the smashing of a window?

76
00:06:58,902 --> 00:07:02,269
- I didn't break that window.
- Yes, but your little prank did.

77
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,069
The judge should've put you behind bars.

78
00:07:05,142 --> 00:07:06,939
What are you, a policeman ?

79
00:07:06,977 --> 00:07:10,936
I merely believe in the law.
And I'm not too keen on practical jokers.

80
00:07:10,981 --> 00:07:13,040
What do you call your lovebird story...

81
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,640
I really wanted the lovebirds

82
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:17,151
You knew I didn't work here.
You deliberately...

83
00:07:17,254 --> 00:07:19,654
I recognized you when I came in.

84
00:07:19,756 --> 00:07:23,185
I thought you might like to know
what it's like to be
on the other end of a gag.

85
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:26,160
- What do you think of that?
- I think you're a louse.

86
00:07:26,263 --> 00:07:29,892
I am. Good day, Miss Daniels. Madam.

87
00:07:30,968 --> 00:07:33,300
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds.

88
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,272
I'll find something else. See you in court.

89
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:43,778
- Who was that man?
- I have no idea.

90
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:12,864
They said the mynah bird would be here
later this afternoon,

91
00:08:12,942 --> 00:08:14,342
if you care to come back.

92
00:08:14,378 --> 00:08:18,678
- No, you'd better send him.
May I use this phone?
- Why, certainly.

93
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:32,288
Daily News? It's Melanie Daniels.
Could you get me the City Desk?

94
00:08:32,362 --> 00:08:34,660
Just a minute, Mrs. MacGruder.

95
00:08:34,698 --> 00:08:37,895
Hello, Charlie. Melanie.

96
00:08:37,968 --> 00:08:40,903
I want you to do a favor for me.

97
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:44,065
No, this is a small one.

98
00:08:44,174 --> 00:08:48,804
Pressure you? Why, Charlie,
darling, would I try to pressure you?

99
00:08:48,912 --> 00:08:51,506
Would you call the
Department of Motor Vehicles for me?

100
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:53,811
Find out who owns this license plate:

101
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:57,182
W-J-H-0-0-3.

102
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,018
Yes, a California plate.

103
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:04,720
No. I'll stop off in a little while.
Is Daddy in his office?

104
00:09:04,828 --> 00:09:09,265
No, I don't want to break in on a meeting.
Tell him I'll see him later.

105
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,426
Thank you, Charlie.

106
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:17,364
Do you have any lovebirds?

107
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:22,275
Well, no, not in the shop,
but I can order them for you.

108
00:09:22,346 --> 00:09:25,440
- How soon?
- Well... Well, when would you want them?

109
00:09:25,549 --> 00:09:27,346
- Immediately.
- Well, I could probably...

110
00:09:27,384 --> 00:09:29,147
..have them here by tomorrow morning.

111
00:09:29,186 --> 00:09:33,145
- Would that be all right?
- That would be just fine.

112
00:10:22,806 --> 00:10:27,004
- Miss, is that for Mitch Brenner?
- Yes.

113
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,341
- He's not home.
- That's all right.

114
00:10:29,413 --> 00:10:32,610
He won't be back until Monday...
I mean, if those birds are for him.

115
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:34,617
- Monday?
- Yes.

116
00:10:34,651 --> 00:10:36,812
I don't think you should leave them in...

117
00:10:36,853 --> 00:10:38,844
- ..the hall, do you?
- Well... Where did he go?

118
00:10:38,922 --> 00:10:41,117
Bodega Bay. He goes there every weekend.

119
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,215
Bodega Bay. Where's that?

120
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:45,624
Up the coast, about 60 miles north of here.

121
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:47,856
Sixty mi... Oh!

122
00:10:47,964 --> 00:10:52,628
It's an hour and a half by freeway, or
two hours if you take the Coast Highway.

123
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:56,035
I'd look after them myself,
but I'm going away too.

124
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,041
I'm awfully sorry.

125
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,452
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

126
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,647
- I wonder if you could help me.
- I'll try my best.

127
00:12:52,756 --> 00:12:55,623
- I'm looking for a man
named Mitchell Brenner.
- Yeah.

128
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:57,650
- Do you know him?
- Yeah.

129
00:12:57,761 --> 00:12:59,729
- Where does he live?
- Right here, Bodega Bay.

130
00:12:59,763 --> 00:13:03,790
- Yes, I know, but where?
- Right across the bay there.

131
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,800
Where?

132
00:13:17,814 --> 00:13:20,476
- Now, see where I'm pointing?
- Yes.

133
00:13:20,584 --> 00:13:22,814
See them two big trees across there?

134
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:25,878
- On the other side of the bay? Yes.
- And the white house?

135
00:13:25,922 --> 00:13:27,890
- Yes.
- That's where the Brenners live.

136
00:13:27,924 --> 00:13:30,791
The Brenners? Mr. And Mrs. Brenner?

137
00:13:30,827 --> 00:13:34,388
- No. Just Lydia and the two kids.
- The two kids?

138
00:13:34,431 --> 00:13:36,626
Yeah, Mitch and the little girl.

139
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,395
Oh, I see. How do I get down there?

140
00:13:39,502 --> 00:13:41,732
You follow the road around the bay,

141
00:13:41,805 --> 00:13:44,000
and that'll take you to their front door.

142
00:13:44,107 --> 00:13:47,133
The front door.
Is there a back road I can take?

143
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,839
- No. That's the only road.
- You see, I want to surprise them.

144
00:13:50,947 --> 00:13:52,847
Oh.

145
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:55,611
- I don't want them to see me arrive.
- Oh.

146
00:13:55,652 --> 00:13:58,348
It's a surprise, you see.

147
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,787
Well, you could get yourself a boat and

148
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,290
cut right across the bay to their dock.

149
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,158
Where would I get a boat?

150
00:14:06,196 --> 00:14:08,790
Down by the Tides Restaurant.

151
00:14:08,898 --> 00:14:12,459
- Did you ever handle an outboard boat?
- Of course.

152
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:17,801
- Want me to order one for you?
- Well, thank you.

153
00:14:17,907 --> 00:14:19,932
- What name?
- Daniels.

154
00:14:19,976 --> 00:14:22,376
Okay.

155
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:39,194
- I wonder if you could tell me...
- Yeah. Hold it a minute, please.

156
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,389
- The little girl's name?
- The little Brenner girl?

157
00:14:42,432 --> 00:14:44,798
- Yes.
- Uh, Alice, I think.

158
00:14:44,834 --> 00:14:47,894
Harry, what's the Brenner girl's name?

159
00:14:48,004 --> 00:14:50,438
- Lois.
- Alice, isn't it?

160
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,737
- No, it's Lois.
- It's Alice.

161
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:58,611
- Are you sure?
- Well, I'm not positive,
if that's what you mean.

162
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,616
I need her exact name.

163
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,983
Oh, uh... Just hold on
one more minute, please.

164
00:15:04,087 --> 00:15:06,555
In that case, I'll tell you what you do.

165
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:09,888
Go straight through town till
you see a little hotel on your left.

166
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:13,895
- Then you turn right there.
Now, you got that?
- Yes.

167
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:16,898
Near the top of the hill,
you'll see the school, and just beyond,

168
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:19,366
a little house with a red mailbox.

169
00:15:19,402 --> 00:15:22,269
That's where Annie Hayworth,
the schoolteacher, lives.

170
00:15:22,372 --> 00:15:25,705
- You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
- Well, thank you.

171
00:15:25,775 --> 00:15:29,370
Save yourself a lot of trouble.
Name's Alice for sure.

172
00:15:29,412 --> 00:15:32,381
Can I have the boat in about 20 minutes?

173
00:15:32,415 --> 00:15:35,316
- How much for the phone calls?
- Oh, it's nothing.

174
00:15:35,385 --> 00:15:37,580
Thank you.

175
00:16:29,873 --> 00:16:32,899
- Who is it?
- Me.

176
00:16:32,976 --> 00:16:34,967
Who's "me"?

177
00:16:39,215 --> 00:16:41,183
- Miss Hayworth?
- Yes.

178
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:44,186
- I'm Melanie Daniels.
I'm sorry to bother you, but...
- Yes?

179
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,187
The man at the post office sent me.

180
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:48,484
He said you could tell me
the name of the Brenner girl.

181
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,923
Cathy? The one who lives in
the white house across the bay?

182
00:16:50,994 --> 00:16:54,589
That's the one. Cathy Brenner. He
seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.

183
00:16:54,697 --> 00:16:56,289
Which is why the mail never gets

184
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,026
delivered to the right place in this town.

185
00:16:58,134 --> 00:17:00,398
- I'm sorry. Smoke?
- Thank you.

186
00:17:01,371 --> 00:17:05,774
Did, uh... you want to
see Cathy about something?

187
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,934
Well, not exactly.

188
00:17:10,046 --> 00:17:12,446
Oh.

189
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:15,882
Are you a friend of Mitch's?

190
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,886
No, not really.

191
00:17:19,556 --> 00:17:21,990
I've been wanting a
cigarette for the last 20 minutes.

192
00:17:22,091 --> 00:17:24,355
I just couldn't convince myself to stop.

193
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,360
This tilling of the soil can become...

194
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,396
- ..compulsive, you know.
- It's a very pretty garden.

195
00:17:28,498 --> 00:17:32,059
Oh, thank you. Well, it's
something to do in your spare time.

196
00:17:32,168 --> 00:17:35,399
There's a lot of
spare time in Bodega Bay.

197
00:17:35,505 --> 00:17:38,565
Are, uh, you planning on staying long?

198
00:17:38,675 --> 00:17:43,578
- No, just a few hours.
- Then you're leaving after you see Cathy.

199
00:17:43,613 --> 00:17:45,706
Well, something like that.

200
00:17:45,782 --> 00:17:48,012
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to sound so mysterious.

201
00:17:48,117 --> 00:17:50,711
Actually, it's none of my business.

202
00:17:50,787 --> 00:17:53,017
Well, I better be on my way.

203
00:17:53,122 --> 00:17:56,091
- Thank you very much.
- Not at all.

204
00:18:00,129 --> 00:18:03,621
- Did you drive up from San
Francisco by the coast road?
- Yes.

205
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:06,167
- Nice drive.
- It's very beautiful.

206
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:08,464
Is that where you met Mitch?

207
00:18:10,306 --> 00:18:12,570
Yes.

208
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:15,872
I guess that's where
everyone meets Mitch.

209
00:18:15,945 --> 00:18:18,539
Now you sound a bit mysterious,
Miss Hayworth.

210
00:18:18,581 --> 00:18:21,573
Do I?

211
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,847
I don't mean to. Actually,
I'm an open book, I'm afraid.

212
00:18:24,954 --> 00:18:27,889
Or, rather, a closed one.

213
00:18:29,492 --> 00:18:32,791
- Oh, pretty. What are they?
- Lovebirds.

214
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:37,595
I see. Good luck, Miss Daniels.

215
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,898
Thank you. Can I get out this way?

216
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:44,940
Go right around.
It'll take you back to the main road.

217
00:18:44,974 --> 00:18:46,965
Thank you.

218
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:09,224
- Do you have a boat for Miss Daniels?
- Yes, ma'am.

219
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,590
It's the one right below.

220
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:44,521
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I think so.

221
00:25:44,593 --> 00:25:47,187
- What made it do that?
- That's the damnedest thing I ever saw.

222
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:50,732
It seemed to swoop down at you
deliberately. Oh, you're bleeding too.

223
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,735
Let's take care of that. Okay?

224
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:55,998
That's a girl.

225
00:26:02,545 --> 00:26:04,536
Come on.

226
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:09,279
What happened, Mitch?

227
00:26:09,352 --> 00:26:11,582
- Gull hit her.
- A gull?

228
00:26:14,457 --> 00:26:17,790
Oh. Let's try up at the restaurant,
all right?

229
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:25,191
- Might need a tetanus shot.
- I had a booster before I went abroad
last May.

230
00:26:52,895 --> 00:26:55,523
- What happened?
- Hello, Deke. Young lady cut herself.

231
00:26:55,598 --> 00:26:59,694
- Shall I call a doctor?
- I don't think it's that serious.
- Let's see.

232
00:26:59,802 --> 00:27:03,260
Helen, get some cotton and antiseptic.

233
00:27:03,339 --> 00:27:06,172
Um, you cut yourself outside, miss?

234
00:27:06,275 --> 00:27:08,709
Don't worry, Deke. She did it in a boat.

235
00:27:08,744 --> 00:27:10,541
I had a man trip and
fall in the parking lot

236
00:27:10,579 --> 00:27:12,308
once. Sued me before
I could bat an eyelash.

237
00:27:12,348 --> 00:27:15,442
- I don't think Miss Daniels
is gonna sue anybody.
- Here.

238
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:17,985
- Well, you're the lawyer.
- Thank you.

239
00:27:19,588 --> 00:27:22,056
- What's that?
- Just some peroxide.

240
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:24,184
I'll clean out the cut.

241
00:27:26,962 --> 00:27:28,896
So you're a lawyer.

242
00:27:28,964 --> 00:27:31,762
That's right. Of course,
I usually defend people,

243
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:33,562
but if I were prosecuting...

244
00:27:33,602 --> 00:27:37,368
- Do you practice here?
- Uh-uh, San Francisco.
What are you doing up here?

245
00:27:37,473 --> 00:27:40,169
- What kind of law?
- Criminal.

246
00:27:40,209 --> 00:27:44,270
- Is that why you want to see
everyone behind bars?
- Oh, not everyone.

247
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,975
- Only violators and practical jokers.
- That's right.

248
00:27:48,017 --> 00:27:50,577
- Ow!
- Oh, sorry.

249
00:27:50,686 --> 00:27:54,383
- What are you doing up here?
- Didn't you see the lovebirds?

250
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,992
You mean, you came all this
way to bring me those birds?

251
00:27:59,028 --> 00:28:02,657
To bring your sister those birds.
You said it was her birthday.

252
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:07,031
- Besides, I was coming up anyway.
- What for?

253
00:28:07,136 --> 00:28:10,071
To see a friend of mine. Careful.

254
00:28:10,139 --> 00:28:14,166
Oh, sorry. Uh... who's your friend?

255
00:28:15,544 --> 00:28:18,069
Annie Hayworth, the schoolteacher.

256
00:28:18,147 --> 00:28:21,048
Annie Hayworth.

257
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:23,050
Well, small world.

258
00:28:23,152 --> 00:28:25,052
Yes.

259
00:28:26,856 --> 00:28:28,983
How do you know Annie?

260
00:28:29,058 --> 00:28:33,051
We went to school together... college.

261
00:28:33,162 --> 00:28:37,690
Did you? Imagine that.
How long are you staying up here?

262
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:41,895
The weekend.

263
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:46,067
Well, I think the bleeding's almost stopped.
Why don't you hold that on...

264
00:28:54,617 --> 00:28:57,814
- So you came up to see Annie, huh?
- Yes.

265
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,979
- I think you came up to see me.
- No,

266
00:29:00,022 --> 00:29:01,922
why would I want to see you of all people?

267
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:04,619
I don't know, but you
must've gone to a lot of trouble...

268
00:29:04,727 --> 00:29:06,718
to find out who I was and where I lived.

269
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:09,730
It was no trouble at all.
I simply called my father's newspaper.

270
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:13,529
Besides, I was coming up anyway.
I've already told you that.

271
00:29:13,569 --> 00:29:15,662
You really like me, huh?

272
00:29:15,738 --> 00:29:20,266
I loathe you. You have no manners.
You're arrogant and conceited.

273
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:23,539
I wrote you a letter about it,
in fact, but I tore it up.

274
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:26,742
- What did it say?
- None of your business.

275
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:29,875
I can't say I like
your seagulls much, either.

276
00:29:29,952 --> 00:29:32,750
- I come all the way up here to...
- You were coming up anyway, remember?

277
00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:38,959
Mitch?

278
00:29:39,061 --> 00:29:42,155
I thought I saw your car.
What are you doing in town?

279
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,791
- I had to acknowledge a delivery.
- A what?

280
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,492
Mother, I'd like you to meet

281
00:29:46,569 --> 00:29:48,196
Melanie Daniels.
Miss Daniels, my mother.

282
00:29:48,304 --> 00:29:50,864
How do you do?

283
00:29:50,973 --> 00:29:54,101
How do you do, Miss Daniels?
Acknowledge a what?

284
00:29:54,176 --> 00:29:57,577
A delivery. Miss Daniels brought
us some birds from San Francisco.

285
00:29:57,613 --> 00:30:00,207
Oh. For Cathy for her birthday.
Where is she?

286
00:30:00,316 --> 00:30:02,011
Across at Brinkmeyer's. Miss Daniels

287
00:30:02,117 --> 00:30:03,778
is staying up here for the weekend.

288
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:06,811
So I've already
invited her for dinner tonight.

289
00:30:10,593 --> 00:30:14,528
- Well, you did go to the trouble of
bringing those birds.
- Oh, I couldn't possibly.

290
00:30:14,597 --> 00:30:18,590
- You did say birds?
- Yes, lovebirds.

291
00:30:18,701 --> 00:30:20,601
Oh, I see.

292
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:27,800
So we couldn't let you get away
without thanking you in some small way.

293
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,242
And you haven't met Cathy,
and you are staying the weekend.

294
00:30:30,346 --> 00:30:32,746
- Well, yes, but...
- You are, aren't you?

295
00:30:32,815 --> 00:30:35,113
- Certainly, but...
- Then it's all settled.

296
00:30:35,217 --> 00:30:37,811
- What time is dinner, Mother?
- 7:00, the same as usual.

297
00:30:37,853 --> 00:30:40,048
I'll pick you up. Where are you staying?

298
00:30:40,155 --> 00:30:41,645
With Annie, of course

299
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:45,750
Oh, of course. How stupid of me.
A quarter of 7:00?

300
00:30:45,828 --> 00:30:48,626
Annie may have made other plans.
I'll have to see.

301
00:30:48,664 --> 00:30:51,224
Besides, I can find my own way.

302
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,030
You're sure now?
You won't hire a boat or anything?

303
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:56,663
- I'm sure.
- 7:00, then.

304
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,763
Maybe.

305
00:30:58,841 --> 00:31:01,002
We'll be waiting for you.
How's your head?

306
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,101
Much better, thank you.

307
00:31:03,178 --> 00:31:06,272
A gull hit me, Mrs. Brenner, that's all.

308
00:31:19,328 --> 00:31:22,991
- Oh, hi. Did you find her all right?
- Yes, I did.

309
00:31:23,098 --> 00:31:25,328
I was wondering...

310
00:31:25,401 --> 00:31:28,199
Uh, that sign there.

311
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:31,898
Do you suppose I could have
the room for just a single night?

312
00:31:32,007 --> 00:31:34,942
- I was planning on renting it
for a longer time...
- I would appreciate it.

313
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:38,411
I've tried everywhere in town.
They're all full.

314
00:31:38,447 --> 00:31:41,610
Well, all right. Got your bags in the car?

315
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:45,920
Well, it's utilitarian, I'll say that.

316
00:31:46,021 --> 00:31:48,922
I just picked up some things
for the night at the general store.

317
00:31:49,024 --> 00:31:52,016
I hadn't planned on staying very long.

318
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:55,961
Yes, I know.
Did something unexpected come up?

319
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:00,864
Yes. May I use your phone?
I'd like to call home.

320
00:32:00,969 --> 00:32:04,166
I just put some coffee on the stove.

321
00:32:04,206 --> 00:32:08,370
Don't they ever stop migrating?

322
00:33:03,699 --> 00:33:05,667
Hi!

323
00:33:07,803 --> 00:33:10,135
Hi!

324
00:33:10,172 --> 00:33:12,367
- Miss Daniels?
- Yes.

325
00:33:13,776 --> 00:33:15,903
Oh, they're beautiful!

326
00:33:15,978 --> 00:33:18,970
They're just what I wanted.
Is there a man and a woman?

327
00:33:19,014 --> 00:33:22,973
- I can't tell which is which.
- Well, I suppose so.

328
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:25,679
- Hello there. Annie had no plans, huh?
- No.

329
00:33:25,788 --> 00:33:27,688
We're very glad you could come.
Are you hungry?

330
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,020
- Reasonably.
- Dinner's just about ready.

331
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:33,027
We've been looking at the chickens.
Something seems to be wrong with them.

332
00:33:33,128 --> 00:33:35,096
There's nothing wrong with those chickens.

333
00:33:35,197 --> 00:33:37,995
- I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer
right now.
- What good's that gonna do?

334
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,091
The chickens won't eat.

335
00:33:40,202 --> 00:33:42,397
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?

336
00:33:42,504 --> 00:33:46,099
- Caveat emptor, Mother.
Let the buyer beware.
- Whose side are you on?

337
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:49,439
- Merely quoting the law, dear.
- Never mind the law.

338
00:33:56,051 --> 00:34:00,147
This won't take long, Miss Dan...
Hello, Fred? Lydia Brenner.

339
00:34:00,222 --> 00:34:02,000
I didn't interrupt your dinner, did I?

340
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,100
- How about a drink?
- I'd love one.

341
00:34:03,158 --> 00:34:06,585
That feed you sold me is no good.

342
00:34:06,695 --> 00:34:11,962
The chicken feed. Well, it's just no good.
The chickens won't eat it.

343
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:14,160
They're always hungry.

344
00:34:14,203 --> 00:34:17,297
I opened a sack for them when I got home,
and they just wouldn't touch it.

345
00:34:17,372 --> 00:34:19,772
You know chickens as well as I do,
and when they won't eat,

346
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:23,073
there's something wrong
with what they're being fed.

347
00:34:23,178 --> 00:34:27,080
No, they're not fussy chickens.

348
00:34:27,182 --> 00:34:30,310
Who? What's he got to do with it?

349
00:34:30,385 --> 00:34:33,183
- Is that your father?
- Mm-hmm. Please sit down.

350
00:34:33,222 --> 00:34:37,420
I don't care how many sacks of
feed you sold him. My chicken...

351
00:34:39,027 --> 00:34:42,190
Oh, I see.

352
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:44,595
Dan Fawcett.

353
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:48,636
This afternoon? That proves what
I'm saying. The feed you sold us...

354
00:34:50,973 --> 00:34:54,204
Oh.

355
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:57,904
Well, maybe I better go over and see him.

356
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:01,677
You don't think there's
something going around, do you?

357
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:04,184
No, never!

358
00:35:04,253 --> 00:35:08,656
No, they don't seem sick at all.
They just won't eat.

359
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,057
Uh-huh.

360
00:35:12,094 --> 00:35:16,690
Well, I'll try to go
over and see him. Maybe he...

361
00:35:16,765 --> 00:35:19,700
Uh-huh. All right.

362
00:35:19,768 --> 00:35:22,259
Thanks.

363
00:35:24,106 --> 00:35:26,973
He had a call from Dan Fawcett a while ago.

364
00:35:27,075 --> 00:35:28,975
His chickens won't eat either.

365
00:35:29,077 --> 00:35:32,513
It's what you said, Mom.
Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.

366
00:35:32,581 --> 00:35:36,210
No, Cathy.
He sold Mr. Fawcett a different brand.

367
00:35:36,318 --> 00:35:39,776
You don't think they're
getting sick, do you, Mitch?

368
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:48,627
I still don't understand how you knew
I wanted lovebirds.

369
00:35:48,696 --> 00:35:50,528
Your brother told me.

370
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:54,433
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco?
Is that right?

371
00:35:54,536 --> 00:35:56,527
No, not exactly.

372
00:35:56,605 --> 00:35:59,005
Mitch knows a lot of people
in San Francisco.

373
00:35:59,107 --> 00:36:01,302
Of course, they're mostly hoods.

374
00:36:01,343 --> 00:36:05,336
- Cathy!
- Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.

375
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:09,146
He's spends half his day in the
detention cells at the Hall of Justice.

376
00:36:09,184 --> 00:36:12,483
In a democracy, Cathy,
everyone is entitled to a fair trial.

377
00:36:12,554 --> 00:36:15,352
- Your brother's practice...
- Aw, Mom, please!

378
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:18,587
I know all that democracy jazz.
They're still hoods.

379
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:24,892
He has a client now who shot
his wife in the head six times.

380
00:36:24,967 --> 00:36:28,095
Six times! Can you imagine it?

381
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:32,197
I mean, even twice would be overdoing it,
don't you think?

382
00:36:32,307 --> 00:36:33,797
Why did he shoot her?

383
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:36,104
He was watching a ball game on television

384
00:36:36,178 --> 00:36:39,170
- What?
- His wife changed the channel.

385
00:36:40,916 --> 00:36:44,374
- Are you coming to my party tomorrow?
- I don't think so.

386
00:36:44,419 --> 00:36:46,887
I have to get back to San Francisco.

387
00:36:46,922 --> 00:36:48,913
Don't you like us?

388
00:36:48,991 --> 00:36:51,425
Oh, darling, of course I do.

389
00:36:51,493 --> 00:36:54,326
- Don't you like Bodega Bay?
- I don't know yet.

390
00:36:54,396 --> 00:36:57,923
Mitch likes it very much.
He comes up every weekend, you know,

391
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,833
even though he has his
own apartment in the city.

392
00:37:00,936 --> 00:37:04,269
He says San Francisco's like an
anthill at the foot of a bridge.

393
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:06,864
I suppose it does get hectic at times.

394
00:37:06,942 --> 00:37:11,276
Well, if you do decide to come,
don't say I told you about it.

395
00:37:11,346 --> 00:37:13,541
It's supposed to be a surprise party.

396
00:37:13,582 --> 00:37:16,745
They've got this whole
complicated thing figured out...

397
00:37:16,785 --> 00:37:19,253
where I'm going to
Michele's for the afternoon,

398
00:37:19,354 --> 00:37:21,745
and Michele's mother will say that
she has a headache,

399
00:37:21,856 --> 00:37:23,390
would I mind if she took me home.

400
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:26,552
Then when I get home here,
all the kids'll jump out!

401
00:37:28,764 --> 00:37:32,666
Oh, won't you come?
Won't you please come?

402
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,361
I don't think so.

403
00:37:39,608 --> 00:37:43,169
- She's a charming girl,
isn't she, Mitch? Hmm?
- Yes.

404
00:37:43,211 --> 00:37:45,577
- Certainly pretty.
- Mm-hmm.

405
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,375
How long have you known her?

406
00:37:47,416 --> 00:37:49,714
- Now, I told you, dear, we met yesterday

407
00:37:49,785 --> 00:37:51,980
In a bird shop. In a bird shop.

408
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,988
She was selling birds?

409
00:37:54,089 --> 00:37:56,182
No, no. I just led her into believing

410
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:58,282
that I believed she was, and then...

411
00:37:58,393 --> 00:38:00,293
It's all very complicated. But she did buy

412
00:38:00,395 --> 00:38:02,124
the lovebirds and then
drove all the way here.

413
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,130
- Mother.
- Yes?

414
00:38:04,232 --> 00:38:07,565
Where did you go to law school?

415
00:38:07,669 --> 00:38:09,569
Forgive me.

416
00:38:09,671 --> 00:38:13,163
I suppose I'm just naturally
curious about a girl like that.

417
00:38:13,275 --> 00:38:15,175
She's very rich, isn't she?

418
00:38:15,277 --> 00:38:18,872
Yeah, I suppose so. Her father's
part owner of one of the big newspapers.

419
00:38:18,947 --> 00:38:22,144
You'd think he could manage
to keep her name out of print.

420
00:38:22,184 --> 00:38:26,143
- She's always mentioned in the columns,
Mitch.
- Yes, I know.

421
00:38:26,188 --> 00:38:31,057
She is the one who jumped into a
fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?

422
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:33,093
Yes.

423
00:38:33,161 --> 00:38:35,459
I supposed I'm old-fashioned. I know it

424
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:37,759
was supposed to be very warm there, but...

425
00:38:37,799 --> 00:38:42,293
- Well, actually the newspapers
said she was naked.
- Yes, I know, dear.

426
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:45,203
It's none of my business,
but when you bring a girl like that...

427
00:38:45,307 --> 00:38:47,571
- Darling?
- Yes?

428
00:38:47,609 --> 00:38:51,340
I think I can handle
Melanie Daniels by myself.

429
00:38:51,379 --> 00:38:55,372
Well... as long as you
know what you want, Mitch.

430
00:38:56,785 --> 00:38:59,379
I know exactly what I want.

431
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:07,962
- Be able to find your
way back all right?
- Oh, yes.

432
00:39:10,132 --> 00:39:13,568
- Will I be seeing you again?
- San Francisco's a long way from here.

433
00:39:13,668 --> 00:39:16,432
I'm in San Francisco five days a
week with a lot of time on my hands.

434
00:39:16,538 --> 00:39:20,133
I'd like to see you.
Maybe we could go swimming or something.

435
00:39:20,242 --> 00:39:22,733
Mother tells me you like to swim.

436
00:39:22,844 --> 00:39:26,541
- How does Mother know what I like to do?
- We read the same gossip column.

437
00:39:26,648 --> 00:39:30,982
- Oh, that... Rome.
- I really like to swim.
We might get along very well.

438
00:39:31,086 --> 00:39:32,951
In case you're interested, I was pushed...

439
00:39:32,988 --> 00:39:34,751
- ..into that fountain.
- Without any clothes on?

440
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,758
With all my clothes on.
The newspaper that ran that story...

441
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:39,952
happens to be a rival of my father's paper.

442
00:39:40,061 --> 00:39:41,956
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstances?

443
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,660
I'm neither poor nor innocent.

444
00:39:43,765 --> 00:39:45,562
- The truth of that particular...
- The truth is,

445
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,500
you're running around
with a pretty wild crowd.

446
00:39:47,569 --> 00:39:49,161
Yes, that's the truth, but I was pushed

447
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:51,068
into that fountain,
and that's the truth too.

448
00:39:51,173 --> 00:39:54,574
Uh-huh.
Do you really know Annie Hayworth?

449
00:39:54,609 --> 00:39:57,100
No. At least I didn't
until I came up here.

450
00:39:57,179 --> 00:39:59,113
- So you didn't go to school together?
- No.

451
00:39:59,181 --> 00:40:01,115
- And you didn't come here to see her?
- No!

452
00:40:01,183 --> 00:40:03,174
- You were lying!
- Yes, I was lying.

453
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:06,220
- What about the letter you wrote me?
Is that a lie?
- No, I wrote the letter.

454
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:09,586
- Well, what did it say?
- It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner.

455
00:40:09,691 --> 00:40:11,522
I think you need these lovebirds after

456
00:40:11,593 --> 00:40:13,390
all. They may help your personality."

457
00:40:13,428 --> 00:40:15,521
- That's what it said.
- But you tore it up?

458
00:40:15,597 --> 00:40:17,121
- Yes.
- Why?

459
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:19,497
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.

460
00:40:19,601 --> 00:40:22,729
- Like jumping into a fountain in Rome.
- I told you what happened!

461
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:24,601
You don't expect me to believe that,
do you?

462
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:26,630
I don't give a damn what you believe!

463
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:29,209
- I'd still like to see you.
- Why?

464
00:40:29,311 --> 00:40:30,801
I think it might be fun.

465
00:40:30,912 --> 00:40:34,313
That might've been good enough in Rome,
but it's not good enough now.

466
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:35,906
- It is for me.
- Well, not for me.

467
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:38,417
- What do you want?
- I thought you knew.

468
00:40:38,453 --> 00:40:40,751
I want to go through life...

469
00:40:40,822 --> 00:40:43,052
jumping into fountains naked.
Good night.

470
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:04,374
- Miss Daniels, is that you?
- Yes.

471
00:41:04,479 --> 00:41:06,709
Hi.

472
00:41:06,781 --> 00:41:10,308
Is something wrong?
Is that cut beginning to bother you?

473
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,615
No, it's not the
cut that's bothering me.

474
00:41:14,189 --> 00:41:17,989
- Would you like some brandy?
- If you have some, I'd love it.

475
00:41:18,093 --> 00:41:20,584
I'll get it. Why don't you sit down.

476
00:41:20,695 --> 00:41:23,721
Oh, would you like a
sweater or something, a quilt?

477
00:41:23,798 --> 00:41:26,096
No. No, thank you.

478
00:41:28,703 --> 00:41:30,796
Won't you call me Melanie?

479
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,839
All right.

480
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:43,646
- Thank you.
- Gets a bit chilly here
at night sometimes,

481
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:47,313
especially if you're over near the bay.

482
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:50,016
Well, how did your evening go?

483
00:41:51,526 --> 00:41:54,051
Did you meet Lydia?

484
00:41:54,162 --> 00:41:57,063
Or would you rather
I changed the subject?

485
00:41:57,165 --> 00:41:59,156
I think so.

486
00:42:00,969 --> 00:42:04,370
Well, how do you like our little hamlet?

487
00:42:04,472 --> 00:42:05,962
I despise it

488
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:09,944
I suppose it doesn't offer
much to the casual visitor,

489
00:42:09,978 --> 00:42:12,970
unless you're thrilled by a
collection of shacks on a hillside.

490
00:42:13,081 --> 00:42:15,276
It takes a bit of getting used to.

491
00:42:15,383 --> 00:42:18,216
- Where are you from originally?
- San Francisco.

492
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,585
How did you happen to come up here?

493
00:42:22,991 --> 00:42:27,587
A friend invited me up
for a weekend a long time ago.

494
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:31,493
Look, I see no reason
for being coy about this.

495
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,296
- It was Mitch Brenner.
I guess you knew that anyway.
- I suspected as much.

496
00:42:35,403 --> 00:42:37,735
Well, you needn't worry.

497
00:42:37,806 --> 00:42:40,741
It's been over and
done with a long time ago.

498
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:45,644
- Annie, there's nothing between
Mr. Brenner and me.
- Isn't there?

499
00:42:45,747 --> 00:42:48,409
Well, maybe there isn't.

500
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:51,146
Maybe there's never been
anything between Mitch and any girl.

501
00:42:51,219 --> 00:42:54,052
What do you mean?

502
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:57,249
I think I'll have some of that.

503
00:42:57,325 --> 00:43:00,123
I was seeing a lot
of him in San Francisco.

504
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:02,288
One weekend,
he invited me up to meet Lydia.

505
00:43:02,364 --> 00:43:03,888
When was this?

506
00:43:03,965 --> 00:43:07,901
Oh, four years ago,
shortly after his father died

507
00:43:07,969 --> 00:43:12,201
- Of course, things may be different now.
- Different?

508
00:43:12,307 --> 00:43:15,003
With Lydia.

509
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:19,171
- Did she seem a trifle distant?
- Mm, a trifle.

510
00:43:19,214 --> 00:43:22,513
Well, then perhaps things
aren't quite so different.

511
00:43:22,584 --> 00:43:26,076
You know,
her attitude nearly drove me crazy.

512
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:28,985
When I got back to San Francisco,
I spent days trying to figure out...

513
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,991
what I'd done to displease her.

514
00:43:31,092 --> 00:43:35,028
- Well, what had you done?
- Nothing.

515
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:39,794
I simply existed. So what's the answer?
A jealous woman, right?

516
00:43:39,901 --> 00:43:41,835
A clinging, possessive mother?

517
00:43:41,936 --> 00:43:43,927
Wrong. With all due respect to

518
00:43:44,005 --> 00:43:45,939
Oedipus, I don't think that was the case.

519
00:43:46,007 --> 00:43:49,033
Then what was it?

520
00:43:49,144 --> 00:43:52,136
Lydia liked me. That's the strange part.

521
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:55,148
Now that I'm no longer a threat,
we're very good friends.

522
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:59,653
- Then why did she object to you?
- Because she was afraid.

523
00:43:59,754 --> 00:44:03,952
- Afraid you'd take Mitch?
- Afraid I'd give Mitch.

524
00:44:03,992 --> 00:44:05,960
I don't understand.

525
00:44:05,994 --> 00:44:08,053
Afraid of any woman who would give Mitch

526
00:44:08,163 --> 00:44:10,097
the one thing Lydia can give him: Love.

527
00:44:10,165 --> 00:44:12,690
That adds up to a jealous,
possessive woman.

528
00:44:12,767 --> 00:44:15,895
No, I don't think so.

529
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:19,167
You see, she's not afraid of losing Mitch.

530
00:44:19,207 --> 00:44:21,505
She's only afraid of being abandoned.

531
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:26,013
Someone ought to tell her
she'd be gaining a daughter.

532
00:44:26,114 --> 00:44:29,106
No. She already has a daughter.

533
00:44:29,184 --> 00:44:34,178
Well, what about Mitch?
Didn't he have anything to say about this?

534
00:44:34,289 --> 00:44:36,883
Well, I can understand his position.

535
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:39,789
He'd just been through a lot
with Lydia after his father died.

536
00:44:39,828 --> 00:44:42,592
He didn't want to risk
going through it all again.

537
00:44:42,697 --> 00:44:44,187
Oh, I see

538
00:44:44,299 --> 00:44:46,790
So it ended. Not right then, of course.

539
00:44:46,901 --> 00:44:49,335
We went back to San Francisco, saw each

540
00:44:49,404 --> 00:44:51,804
other now and then,
but we both knew it was over.

541
00:44:51,906 --> 00:44:54,739
Then what are you
doing here in Bodega Bay?

542
00:44:54,809 --> 00:44:56,504
I wanted to be near Mitch

543
00:44:56,611 --> 00:45:00,138
Oh, it was over and done with,
and I knew it, but...

544
00:45:00,215 --> 00:45:03,184
I still wanted to be near him.

545
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:06,276
I still like him a hell of a lot,

546
00:45:06,354 --> 00:45:10,154
and I don't want to
lose that friendship... ever.

547
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:22,360
Hello.

548
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:25,405
No, no, no, I wasn't asleep.

549
00:45:25,507 --> 00:45:28,567
Yes, just a little while ago.

550
00:45:28,676 --> 00:45:30,940
Sure. Hold on.

551
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:32,970
It's Mitch.

552
00:45:33,014 --> 00:45:34,982
For you.

553
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:46,023
Hello? Oh, yes, this is Melanie.

554
00:45:47,395 --> 00:45:49,488
Fine, thank you.

555
00:45:49,597 --> 00:45:53,328
No, no trouble at all.
I simply followed the road.

556
00:45:54,702 --> 00:45:57,899
Well... There's no need to apologize.

557
00:45:58,006 --> 00:46:00,440
I can understand...

558
00:46:01,743 --> 00:46:04,940
That's very kind of you.
No, I'm not angry.

559
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:12,547
Well, I couldn't.
I have to get back to San Francisco.

560
00:46:14,088 --> 00:46:17,057
No, I wouldn't want to
disappoint Cathy, but...

561
00:46:20,895 --> 00:46:22,795
I see.

562
00:46:24,666 --> 00:46:27,362
All right. Yes, I'll be there.

563
00:46:27,468 --> 00:46:29,561
Good night, Mitch.

564
00:46:32,173 --> 00:46:36,507
He wants me to go to Cathy's party
tomorrow afternoon. I said I would.

565
00:46:36,578 --> 00:46:38,569
It should be fun.

566
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,376
I'll be there, too, to help.

567
00:46:41,416 --> 00:46:44,385
Oh, it seems so pointless.

568
00:46:44,419 --> 00:46:48,378
Well, I think I'll go to sleep.
It's been a busy day.

569
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,629
My luggage.

570
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,169
That's pretty.
Where'd you get that? Brinkmeyer's?

571
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:05,728
Mm-hmm. Do you think I should go?

572
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,070
Well, that's up to you.

573
00:47:08,142 --> 00:47:10,667
No, it's really up to Lydia, isn't it?

574
00:47:12,547 --> 00:47:17,575
- Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
- Yes.

575
00:47:17,685 --> 00:47:21,143
- Then go.
- Thank you, Annie.

576
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:26,090
Oh. Wonder who that can be.

577
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,253
Is someone there?

578
00:47:28,363 --> 00:47:32,163
- Who is it?
- Look.

579
00:47:33,668 --> 00:47:38,196
Poor thing.
Probably lost his way in the dark.

580
00:47:38,306 --> 00:47:40,968
But it isn't dark, Annie.

581
00:47:41,075 --> 00:47:43,168
There's a full moon.

582
00:47:51,886 --> 00:47:54,912
Cathy, that's very good. Very good.

583
00:47:57,091 --> 00:47:59,389
Okay. Here we go.

584
00:48:18,946 --> 00:48:22,382
Attagirl. Come on.
Don't let him get you.

585
00:48:38,199 --> 00:48:40,793
No, I really shouldn't have any more.
I'm driving.

586
00:48:40,902 --> 00:48:42,699
Well, actually, I'm trying to get you to

587
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:44,670
stay for dinner.
A lot of roast beef left over.

588
00:48:44,772 --> 00:48:49,766
- No, I couldn't possibly.
I... have to get back.
- All right.

589
00:48:49,877 --> 00:48:51,868
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

590
00:48:53,981 --> 00:48:57,508
Why do you have to rush off?
What's so important in San Francisco?

591
00:48:57,585 --> 00:49:01,021
Well, I have to get to work tomorrow,
for one thing.

592
00:49:01,122 --> 00:49:04,114
- You have a job?
- I have several jobs.

593
00:49:04,225 --> 00:49:07,558
- What do you do?
- I do different things on different days.

594
00:49:07,662 --> 00:49:09,562
Like what?

595
00:49:09,664 --> 00:49:11,222
Well, on Mondays and Wednesdays, I work

596
00:49:11,332 --> 00:49:12,822
for the Travelers' Aid at the airport.

597
00:49:12,934 --> 00:49:14,868
Helping travelers?

598
00:49:14,936 --> 00:49:18,133
No, misdirecting them.
I thought you could read my character.

599
00:49:18,172 --> 00:49:22,268
On Tuesdays, I take a course in
General Semantics at Berkeley...

600
00:49:22,343 --> 00:49:24,470
finding new four-letter words.

601
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:27,139
- That's not a job, of course...
- You mean, you don't have to...

602
00:49:27,248 --> 00:49:29,978
And on Thursdays,
I have my meeting and lunch.

603
00:49:30,084 --> 00:49:31,779
In the underworld, I suppose

604
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:34,047
I shall disappoint you.

605
00:49:34,155 --> 00:49:37,147
We're sending a little
Korean boy through school.

606
00:49:37,258 --> 00:49:39,692
We actually raise money for it.

607
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:45,896
You see, Rome...

608
00:49:45,967 --> 00:49:49,494
That entire summer, I did nothing but...

609
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:52,403
Well, it was very easy to get lost there.

610
00:49:52,507 --> 00:49:56,170
So when I came back,
I thought it was time I began...

611
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:58,508
I don't know... finding something again.

612
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:05,613
So, on Mondays and Thursdays,
I keep myself busy.

613
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:09,617
- What about Fridays?
- Fridays? They're free.

614
00:50:12,293 --> 00:50:16,093
I sometimes go to bird shops on Fridays.

615
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:19,122
I'm very glad you do.

616
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,225
A nice, innocent, little day.

617
00:50:21,335 --> 00:50:23,803
Oh, yes.

618
00:50:26,307 --> 00:50:29,208
I have an Aunt Tessa.
Have you got an Aunt Tessa?

619
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:30,800
Mm-mm

620
00:50:30,912 --> 00:50:33,813
Mine is very prim and straight-laced.

621
00:50:33,915 --> 00:50:36,816
I'm giving her a mynah bird
when she comes back from Europe.

622
00:50:36,918 --> 00:50:40,854
Mynah birds talk, you know.
Can you see my Aunt Tessa's face...

623
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:45,551
when this one tells us one or two of
the words I've picked up at Berkeley?

624
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:48,220
You need a mother's care, my child.

625
00:50:50,364 --> 00:50:53,925
- Not my mother's.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

626
00:50:55,536 --> 00:50:58,630
What have you got to be sorry about?

627
00:50:58,673 --> 00:51:01,301
My mother? Don't waste your time.

628
00:51:01,375 --> 00:51:05,072
She ditched us when I was 11 and
ran off with some hotel man in the East.

629
00:51:05,179 --> 00:51:08,205
You know what a mother's love is?

630
00:51:10,218 --> 00:51:13,813
- Yes, I do.
- You mean it's better to be ditched?

631
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:20,425
No. I think it's better to be
loved. Don't you ever see her?

632
00:51:26,133 --> 00:51:29,330
I don't know where she is.

633
00:51:31,405 --> 00:51:35,000
Well, maybe I ought to
go join the other children.

634
00:51:41,148 --> 00:51:43,912
All right. Here we go. One...

635
00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:47,947
two...

636
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:50,513
three.

637
00:51:50,625 --> 00:51:52,650
There you go.

638
00:52:01,502 --> 00:52:04,266
Look! Look!

639
00:52:04,372 --> 00:52:06,897
Hey! No touching allowed!

640
00:52:08,609 --> 00:52:11,373
Oh!

641
00:52:36,704 --> 00:52:40,003
Help me get the children into the house.

642
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:16,176
There you go.

643
00:53:19,981 --> 00:53:23,382
Have they gone, Mitch?

644
00:53:23,417 --> 00:53:25,783
- I think so.
- Is anyone hurt?

645
00:53:25,886 --> 00:53:28,616
Jenny got a scratch down her cheek,
but it's nothing.

646
00:53:28,689 --> 00:53:31,123
That makes three times.

647
00:53:34,695 --> 00:53:37,186
Mitch, this isn't usual, is it?

648
00:53:37,231 --> 00:53:39,096
The gull when I was in the boat yesterday,

649
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,895
the one at Annie's last night...

650
00:53:41,002 --> 00:53:42,902
Last night? What do you mean?

651
00:53:43,004 --> 00:53:47,407
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.
Mitch, what's happening?

652
00:53:47,441 --> 00:53:50,638
I... I don't know.
Do you have to go back to Annie's?

653
00:53:50,745 --> 00:53:52,645
No. I have my things in the car.

654
00:53:52,747 --> 00:53:57,013
Stay and have something to eat before
you start back. I'd feel a lot better.

655
00:54:07,061 --> 00:54:10,258
- Would you like some mustard with that?
- No, thank you.

656
00:54:10,297 --> 00:54:12,000
Why didn't Annie stay?

657
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:14,559
Said something about going home
to take a call from her sister.

658
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,659
What's the matter with them?

659
00:54:16,771 --> 00:54:19,968
- What's the matter with all the birds?
- Where did you want this coffee?

660
00:54:20,074 --> 00:54:23,168
- Here on the table, honey.
- Hurry up with yours, Mitch.

661
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:25,974
I'm sure Miss Daniels
wants to be on her way.

662
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:28,413
I think you ought to stay the night,
Melanie.

663
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:31,508
We have an extra room
upstairs and everything.

664
00:54:31,585 --> 00:54:34,110
That road can be a
pretty bad one at night.

665
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:36,019
If I go across to Santa Rosa, I'll come

666
00:54:36,123 --> 00:54:37,818
out on the freeway much earlier, won't I?

667
00:54:37,925 --> 00:54:39,893
Yes, and the freeway is much quicker.

668
00:54:39,927 --> 00:54:43,294
But she'll be hitting all the heavy
traffic going back to San Francisco.

669
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:46,822
Just listen to those lovebirds.

670
00:54:48,936 --> 00:54:51,302
Mitch.

671
00:55:01,449 --> 00:55:04,384
Cover your faces! Cover your eyes!

672
00:56:23,497 --> 00:56:25,658
That's a sparrow, all right.

673
00:56:25,699 --> 00:56:29,294
- We know what it is, Al.
- Did you have a light burning
or something?

674
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:32,737
Yes, but there wouldn't have been
that much light going up the chimney.

675
00:56:32,773 --> 00:56:36,368
Sometimes birds are attracted by light.
Sure is a peculiar thing.

676
00:56:36,477 --> 00:56:39,071
All right, but we've got
to do something about it!

677
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:42,377
I don't think I get you, Mitch.
Do about what?

678
00:56:42,483 --> 00:56:45,816
Well, the birds invaded the house.

679
00:56:45,886 --> 00:56:48,821
What's more likely... they
got in the room and just panicked.

680
00:56:48,889 --> 00:56:51,016
I'll admit a bird will
panic in an enclosed room,

681
00:56:51,091 --> 00:56:54,993
but they didn't just get in: :
They came in, right down the chimney.

682
00:56:55,029 --> 00:56:57,588
My wife found a bird in the back seat
of her car once.

683
00:56:57,698 --> 00:56:59,189
Tell him about the party.

684
00:56:59,233 --> 00:57:01,963
We had a party here this
afternoon for Cathy, for her birthday.

685
00:57:02,069 --> 00:57:04,663
- How old is she?
- Eleven! In the middle of the party,

686
00:57:04,738 --> 00:57:07,332
some seagulls came down at the children!

687
00:57:07,374 --> 00:57:09,865
Miss Daniels was
attacked by a gull yesterday.

688
00:57:09,944 --> 00:57:13,380
Yeah. Were the kids
bothering the birds or something?

689
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,038
If you make any kind of a

690
00:57:15,149 --> 00:57:16,946
disturbance near them,
they'll come after you.

691
00:57:17,051 --> 00:57:21,181
Al, the children were playing a game.
Those gulls attacked.

692
00:57:21,288 --> 00:57:24,746
Now, Lydia, "attack" is a
pretty strong word, don't you think?

693
00:57:24,792 --> 00:57:29,058
I mean, birds just don't go around
attacking people without no reason.

694
00:57:29,163 --> 00:57:31,961
The kids probably scared them,
that's all.

695
00:57:32,066 --> 00:57:34,796
These birds attacked.

696
00:57:34,902 --> 00:57:38,599
You got quite a mess here,
I'll admit that.

697
00:57:38,706 --> 00:57:41,368
Maybe you ought to put some
screen on top of your chimney.

698
00:57:41,408 --> 00:57:43,672
- You want help cleaning up?
- No. I can handle it.

699
00:57:43,777 --> 00:57:45,870
It shouldn't be too much of a job.

700
00:57:48,415 --> 00:57:51,680
I'll take Cathy up to bed.

701
00:57:51,785 --> 00:57:54,185
I think I should stay, don't you?

702
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:57,486
It would be nice if you could.

703
00:57:57,591 --> 00:58:00,219
- My things are in the car.
Do you want to go with me?
- All right.

704
00:58:00,327 --> 00:58:02,625
- Well, anything else I can do, Mitch?
- No thanks, Al.

705
00:58:02,663 --> 00:58:05,257
- We'll be all right.
- Good night, Lydia.

706
00:58:05,332 --> 00:58:07,926
Sure is peculiar.

707
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:22,743
Mitch. Mitch. Mitch!

708
00:58:22,783 --> 00:58:26,082
- Yes, Mother?
- I'm going to drop Cathy off now.

709
00:58:26,153 --> 00:58:28,986
I'll probably drive
over to the Fawcett farm.

710
00:58:29,056 --> 00:58:31,354
Okay.

711
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:12,083
Morning.

712
00:59:14,027 --> 00:59:16,495
Good morning, George.
Is Mr. Fawcett around?

713
00:59:16,597 --> 00:59:18,690
I think so, ma'am. Ain't seen him this

714
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:20,790
morning, but he ought to be in there.

715
00:59:22,302 --> 00:59:24,202
Thanks.

716
00:59:45,158 --> 00:59:47,991
Dan, are you home?

717
01:00:50,223 --> 01:00:52,123
Uh...

718
01:00:55,862 --> 01:00:58,626
Uh...

719
01:01:37,604 --> 01:01:39,868
Mother!

720
01:01:39,906 --> 01:01:43,398
What is it, dear? What's the matter?

721
01:01:44,911 --> 01:01:47,744
Oh!

722
01:01:53,319 --> 01:01:56,254
Al Malone, the deputy, just called.
He wants me over at the Fawcett place.

723
01:01:56,322 --> 01:01:58,415
Some detectives from
Santa Rosa will be there.

724
01:01:58,525 --> 01:02:02,154
- Will it be all right?
- Yes. I was just taking your mother
in some tea.

725
01:02:04,364 --> 01:02:07,060
Oh, be careful, please.

726
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:18,878
And you be careful?

727
01:02:51,211 --> 01:02:55,147
Mitch?

728
01:02:55,248 --> 01:02:57,512
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner.

729
01:02:57,550 --> 01:03:01,953
- I thought you might like some tea.
- Oh. Thank you.

730
01:03:03,790 --> 01:03:07,351
- Where's Mitch?
- Al Malone wanted him out
at the Fawcett farm.

731
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:10,361
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?

732
01:03:10,463 --> 01:03:13,227
He was calling from the farm.

733
01:03:13,266 --> 01:03:16,064
Then he saw. Oh, he must have.

734
01:03:16,102 --> 01:03:18,400
They sent for the Santa Rosa police.

735
01:03:18,471 --> 01:03:21,907
What good will they do?

736
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:25,910
Do you think Cathy's
all right at the school?

737
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:30,611
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.

738
01:03:30,683 --> 01:03:34,585
Do I sound very foolish to you?

739
01:03:34,621 --> 01:03:36,589
Oh, no.

740
01:03:39,692 --> 01:03:41,990
I keep seeing Dan's face.

741
01:03:42,095 --> 01:03:44,393
And they have such
big windows at the school.

742
01:03:44,497 --> 01:03:46,431
All the windows are
broken in Dan's bedroom.

743
01:03:46,499 --> 01:03:50,333
- All the windows!
- Try not to think about that.

744
01:03:51,704 --> 01:03:54,696
I wish I were a stronger person.

745
01:03:59,112 --> 01:04:01,979
I lost my husband four years ago,
you know.

746
01:04:03,983 --> 01:04:05,746
It's terrible how you... you depend on

747
01:04:05,852 --> 01:04:07,547
someone else for strength, and then...

748
01:04:09,656 --> 01:04:12,784
suddenly all the strength is gone,
and you're alone.

749
01:04:18,298 --> 01:04:21,893
I'd love to be able to relax sometime.

750
01:04:22,001 --> 01:04:24,663
I'd love to be able to sleep.

751
01:04:27,173 --> 01:04:30,609
- Do you think Cathy's all right?
- Annie's there.

752
01:04:30,677 --> 01:04:33,407
She'll be all right.

753
01:04:35,081 --> 01:04:38,414
I'm not like this, you know?
N ...Not usually.

754
01:04:38,484 --> 01:04:41,282
I don't fuss and fret about my children.

755
01:04:45,625 --> 01:04:48,389
When Frank died...

756
01:04:49,929 --> 01:04:54,025
You see, he understood the children.
He really understood them.

757
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:57,729
He had the knack of entering into
their world, of becoming part of them.

758
01:04:57,837 --> 01:05:01,238
- That's a very rare talent.
- Yes.

759
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:06,675
Oh, I wish, I wish...
I wish I could be like that.

760
01:05:10,783 --> 01:05:12,751
I miss him.

761
01:05:14,854 --> 01:05:17,948
Sometimes, even now,
I wake up in the morning and I think,

762
01:05:17,991 --> 01:05:22,257
"I must get Frank's breakfast."

763
01:05:22,295 --> 01:05:25,992
And I get up, and there's a very
good reason for getting out of bed,

764
01:05:26,065 --> 01:05:28,158
until of course...

765
01:05:28,267 --> 01:05:30,167
I remember.

766
01:05:35,708 --> 01:05:38,575
I miss talking to him.

767
01:05:39,879 --> 01:05:42,575
Cathy's a child, of course, and Mitch...

768
01:05:44,517 --> 01:05:48,112
Well, Mitch has his own life.

769
01:05:48,221 --> 01:05:51,281
I'm glad he stayed here today.

770
01:05:51,324 --> 01:05:54,088
I... I feel safer with him here.

771
01:05:55,828 --> 01:05:58,661
- Would you like to rest now?
- No.

772
01:05:58,698 --> 01:06:00,996
No, don't go.

773
01:06:02,835 --> 01:06:05,235
I feel as if I don't
understand you at all, and I...

774
01:06:05,271 --> 01:06:07,432
I want so much to understand.

775
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:10,441
Why, Mrs. Brenner?

776
01:06:12,245 --> 01:06:16,045
Because my son seems
to be very fond of you.

777
01:06:16,149 --> 01:06:18,276
And I don't quite
know how I feel about it.

778
01:06:22,255 --> 01:06:24,189
I don't even know if I like you or not.

779
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:29,858
Is that so important, your liking me?

780
01:06:29,962 --> 01:06:31,862
Well, yes. I think so.

781
01:06:31,964 --> 01:06:35,695
Mitch is important to me.

782
01:06:35,802 --> 01:06:38,362
I want to like whatever girl he chooses.

783
01:06:40,306 --> 01:06:43,469
And perhaps if you don't?

784
01:06:43,509 --> 01:06:47,673
Well, then I don't think
it'll matter much to anyone but me.

785
01:06:47,713 --> 01:06:50,307
Oh, I think it would
also matter to Mitch.

786
01:06:51,884 --> 01:06:54,876
Mitch has always done
exactly what he wanted to do.

787
01:06:59,826 --> 01:07:05,423
But, you see,
I...I don't want to be left alone.

788
01:07:05,531 --> 01:07:08,364
I don't think I could
bear to be left alone!

789
01:07:08,434 --> 01:07:13,428
Oh, forgive me.

790
01:07:13,473 --> 01:07:16,067
This business with the
birds has upset me, I...

791
01:07:16,175 --> 01:07:19,576
I don't know what I'd
do if Mitch weren't here.

792
01:07:19,645 --> 01:07:22,876
Why don't you try to sleep now,
Mrs. Brenner?

793
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:26,548
I wish I was stronger.

794
01:07:28,154 --> 01:07:32,056
Do you think she's all right?

795
01:07:32,158 --> 01:07:34,058
Do you think she's
all right at the school?

796
01:07:35,661 --> 01:07:40,098
- Would you like me to go for her?
- Oh, I...I couldn't ask it.

797
01:07:40,199 --> 01:07:44,602
- Oh, I don't mind, really.
- Would you?

798
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:48,197
- I'd feel so much better.
- I'll go right now.

799
01:07:58,184 --> 01:08:01,210
Melanie?

800
01:08:02,321 --> 01:08:04,221
Thanks for the tea.

- What?

01:12:15,875 --> 01:12:18,571
- What is it?
- Look.

867
01:12:21,514 --> 01:12:23,709
We've got to get the
children out of here.

01:12:29,021 --> 01:12:31,512
Shh, shh, shh!
All right, children. Now, quiet.

869
01:12:31,624 --> 01:12:34,593
Quiet. Miss Daniels would like to see...

870
01:12:34,693 --> 01:12:36,786
how we conduct
ourselves during a fire drill.

871
01:12:39,465 --> 01:12:42,832
I would like you to show her
how quiet and obedient you can be.

872
01:12:42,902 --> 01:12:45,530
Oh, uh, we're going out of school now.

873
01:12:45,638 --> 01:12:47,128
Leave school

874
01:12:47,239 --> 01:12:49,503
We want those of you who
live nearby to go directly home.

875
01:12:49,608 --> 01:12:51,508
Home?

876
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:53,100
I want the rest of you to go down the

877
01:12:53,212 --> 01:12:55,009
hill all the way to the hotel.
Is that clear?

878
01:12:55,114 --> 01:12:57,105
Yes, Miss Hayworth.

879
01:12:57,149 --> 01:12:59,447
Melanie?

880
01:13:00,619 --> 01:13:03,053
I want you to go as quietly as possible.

881
01:13:03,088 --> 01:13:06,649
Do not make a sound
until I tell you to run.

882
01:13:06,759 --> 01:13:09,489
Then run as quickly as you can.
Now, does everybody understand?

883
01:13:09,595 --> 01:13:11,495
Yes, Miss Hayworth.

884
01:13:11,597 --> 01:13:13,690
All right, John, you lead the way.

885
01:14:48,827 --> 01:14:53,321
Cathy! Cathy!

886
01:15:49,688 --> 01:15:52,486
Well, Daddy, there were hundreds of them.

887
01:15:52,591 --> 01:15:56,789
No, I'm not hysterical. I'm trying to
tell you this as calmly as I know how.

888
01:15:58,497 --> 01:16:01,022
All right, Daddy. Yes, Daddy.

889
01:16:01,066 --> 01:16:04,229
Well, just now. Not 15 minutes ago.

890
01:16:05,838 --> 01:16:08,068
At the school.

891
01:16:08,173 --> 01:16:10,835
No, I don't. Just a minute.
What's the name of the school?

892
01:16:10,876 --> 01:16:14,676
- Just the Bodega Bay School.
- The Bodega Bay School.

893
01:16:16,348 --> 01:16:19,784
Well, I don't know how
many children... 30 or 40.

894
01:16:21,453 --> 01:16:24,581
No, the birds didn't attack until
the children were outside the school.

895
01:16:24,657 --> 01:16:27,148
- Help you, Mrs. Bundy?
- I need some change, Mr. Carter.

896
01:16:27,192 --> 01:16:29,752
Crows, I think.

897
01:16:29,862 --> 01:16:33,298
Well, I don't know, Daddy. Is there a
difference between crows and blackbirds?

898
01:16:33,399 --> 01:16:37,062
There is very definitely a
difference, Miss. Thank you.

899
01:16:37,102 --> 01:16:39,696
They're different, Daddy.

900
01:16:41,173 --> 01:16:43,505
Well, I think these were crows.

901
01:16:43,609 --> 01:16:45,907
Well, yes. Hundreds of them.

902
01:16:45,978 --> 01:16:48,469
Yes, they attacked the children.
Attacked them!

903
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:51,071
Well, I don't know when,

904
01:16:51,183 --> 01:16:54,482
but I simply can't leave now, Daddy.

905
01:16:54,586 --> 01:16:56,816
All right. Yes. Good-bye.

906
01:16:56,889 --> 01:17:00,620
They're both perching birds, of course.
But quite different species.

907
01:17:00,693 --> 01:17:03,161
The crow is Corvus brachyrhynchos,

908
01:17:03,228 --> 01:17:06,629
and the blackbird is
Euphagus cyanocephalos.

909
01:17:06,732 --> 01:17:08,632
Thank you.

910
01:17:08,734 --> 01:17:11,828
- You have the number at the Fawcett farm?
- Right here in this book, miss.

911
01:17:13,839 --> 01:17:15,932
I can't see that it makes
any difference, Mrs. Bundy.

912
01:17:16,041 --> 01:17:19,636
Crows or blackbirds, if the school
was attacked, that's pretty serious.

913
01:17:19,745 --> 01:17:21,645
I hardly think that either species...

914
01:17:21,747 --> 01:17:24,875
would have sufficient
intelligence to launch a massed attack.

915
01:17:24,983 --> 01:17:27,451
Their brainpans are not big enough to...

916
01:17:27,486 --> 01:17:29,579
I just came from the school, madam.

917
01:17:29,655 --> 01:17:31,680
I don't know anything about
their brainpans, but...

918
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:35,282
Well, I do. I do know.

919
01:17:35,394 --> 01:17:37,988
Ornithology happens to be my avocation.

920
01:17:38,063 --> 01:17:41,260
Birds are not aggressive creatures, miss.

921
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:44,292
They bring beauty into the world.
It is mankind, rather, who...

922
01:17:44,403 --> 01:17:46,462
Sam! Three southern fried chicken.

923
01:17:46,505 --> 01:17:48,473
Baked potato on all of them.

924
01:17:48,574 --> 01:17:51,065
Yes, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, please?

925
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:55,479
- Yes, I'll wait.
- It is mankind, rather, who insists upon...

926
01:17:55,581 --> 01:17:58,209
making it difficult for
life to exist upon this planet.

927
01:17:58,283 --> 01:17:59,875
Now, if it were not for birds...

928
01:17:59,985 --> 01:18:01,418
Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand.

929
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,853
This young lady said there
was an attack on the school.

930
01:18:04,957 --> 01:18:06,857
- Impossible!
-  Oh, Mitch?

931
01:18:06,959 --> 01:18:08,824
Oh, I'm glad I caught you.

932
01:18:08,861 --> 01:18:10,658
Something terrible has ha...
It's the end of the world!

933
01:18:10,763 --> 01:18:13,163
Two Bloody Marys, Deke.

934
01:18:13,232 --> 01:18:15,462
- What actually happened at the school?
- Bunch of crows...

935
01:18:15,567 --> 01:18:17,467
attacked the school kids.

936
01:18:17,569 --> 01:18:21,027
It's the end of the world.
"Thus saith the Lord God...

937
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:24,667
"unto the mountains and the
hills, and the rivers and the valleys.

938
01:18:24,777 --> 01:18:27,439
"Behold I, even I...

939
01:18:27,479 --> 01:18:29,447
"shall bring a sword upon you.

940
01:18:29,548 --> 01:18:32,449
And I will devastate your high places."

941
01:18:32,484 --> 01:18:34,452
Ezekiel, chapter six.

942
01:18:34,486 --> 01:18:36,454
"Woe unto them that rise up early
in the morning,

943
01:18:36,555 --> 01:18:38,455
that they may follow strong drink."

944
01:18:38,557 --> 01:18:42,459
Isaiah, chapter five.
It's the end of the world.

945
01:18:42,494 --> 01:18:44,462
I hardly think a few birds are going

946
01:18:44,563 --> 01:18:46,463
to bring about the end of the world.

947
01:18:46,565 --> 01:18:49,796
- These weren't a few birds.
- I didn't know there were many crows...

948
01:18:49,868 --> 01:18:51,802
in Bodega Bay this time of year.

949
01:18:51,870 --> 01:18:55,397
The crow is a permanent
resident throughout its range.

950
01:18:55,474 --> 01:18:58,910
In fact, during our Christmas count,
we recorded...

951
01:18:59,011 --> 01:19:01,206
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?

952
01:19:01,246 --> 01:19:04,409
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes?
There are several varieties.

953
01:19:04,516 --> 01:19:06,814
The ones who've been
playing devil with my fishing boats.

954
01:19:06,852 --> 01:19:09,821
- Have you had trouble with gulls?
- One of my boats did, last week.

955
01:19:09,922 --> 01:19:12,720
This young lady was hit
by a gull only Saturday.

956
01:19:12,825 --> 01:19:16,226
- Deke, I'm still waiting for
those Bloody Marys.
- Coming right up.

957
01:19:16,328 --> 01:19:18,523
Could you ask them to lower their voices,

958
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:20,655
please? They're frightening the children.

959
01:19:20,766 --> 01:19:23,428
A whole flock of gulls
nearly capsized one of my boats.

960
01:19:23,535 --> 01:19:25,435
Practically tore the skipper's arm off.

961
01:19:25,537 --> 01:19:28,131
- You're scaring the kids. Keep it low.
- All right.

962
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:31,038
Yeah, but he's scaring me, too.

963
01:19:31,076 --> 01:19:33,544
Are you trying to say that all these...

964
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:36,948
Nah, that sounds impossible, Sebastian.

965
01:19:36,982 --> 01:19:39,746
Deke, look, I'm just telling you
what happened to one of my boats.

966
01:19:39,852 --> 01:19:42,548
The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes.

967
01:19:42,588 --> 01:19:44,954
Really, let's be logical about this.

968
01:19:45,057 --> 01:19:47,287
What were the crows after at the school?

969
01:19:49,261 --> 01:19:51,456
What do you think they were after?
Miss, uh...

970
01:19:51,496 --> 01:19:54,294
Daniels.
I think they were after the children.

971
01:19:54,399 --> 01:19:58,665
- For what purpose?
- To kill them.

972
01:19:58,704 --> 01:20:03,004
- Why?
- I don't know why.

973
01:20:03,075 --> 01:20:06,476
I thought not. Birds have
been on this planet, Miss Daniels,

974
01:20:06,511 --> 01:20:10,277
Since archeopteryx,
140 million years ago.

975
01:20:10,315 --> 01:20:13,375
Doesn't it seem odd that
they'd wait all that time...

976
01:20:13,485 --> 01:20:16,113
to start a... a war against humanity?

977
01:20:16,221 --> 01:20:18,621
- No one called it a war.
- Scotch, light on the water.

978
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:21,591
You and Mr. Sholes
seem to be implying as much.

979
01:20:21,627 --> 01:20:24,425
Who said anything about a war?
All I said, some gulls...

980
01:20:24,496 --> 01:20:26,430
- Want some more coffee?
- No.

981
01:20:26,498 --> 01:20:28,432
...came down on one of my boats.

982
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,695
They could have been after the fish,
just like you said.

983
01:20:30,736 --> 01:20:33,534
- The Captain should have shot at them.
- Huh?

984
01:20:33,639 --> 01:20:37,097
Gulls are scavengers, anyway.
Most birds are.

985
01:20:37,209 --> 01:20:39,734
Get yourselves guns and wipe
them off the face of the Earth!

986
01:20:39,845 --> 01:20:43,838
- That would hardly be possible.
- Why not, Mrs. Bundy?

987
01:20:43,916 --> 01:20:47,317
Because there are 8,650 species...

988
01:20:47,419 --> 01:20:50,115
of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter.

989
01:20:50,222 --> 01:20:54,056
It is estimated that 5,750,000,000 birds...

990
01:20:54,126 --> 01:20:56,060
live in the United States alone.

991
01:20:56,128 --> 01:20:58,062
The five continents of the world...

992
01:20:58,130 --> 01:21:00,928
Kill them all.
Get rid of the messy animals.

993
01:21:00,966 --> 01:21:04,060
...probably contain
more than 100 billion birds.

994
01:21:04,102 --> 01:21:05,626
It's the end of the world.

995
01:21:05,671 --> 01:21:07,866
Those gulls must have been after the fish

996
01:21:07,906 --> 01:21:10,807
- Of course!
- Hurry up, children. Finish your lunch.

997
01:21:10,876 --> 01:21:13,572
Are the birds gonna eat us, Mommy?

998
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:16,409
Hell, maybe we're all getting
a little carried away by this.

999
01:21:16,481 --> 01:21:18,176
Admittedly, a few birds did act strange,

1000
01:21:18,283 --> 01:21:19,875
but that's no reason to believe that...

1001
01:21:19,918 --> 01:21:24,082
I keep telling you, this isn't a few birds.
These are gulls, crows, swifts...

1002
01:21:24,189 --> 01:21:27,386
I have never known birds of
different species to flock together.

1003
01:21:27,492 --> 01:21:29,983
The very concept is unimaginable.

1004
01:21:30,095 --> 01:21:33,292
Why, if that happened,
we wouldn't have a chance!

1005
01:21:33,398 --> 01:21:35,628
How could we possibly hope to fight them?

1006
01:21:35,701 --> 01:21:38,795
We couldn't, you're right.
You're right, Mrs. Bundy.

1007
01:21:38,904 --> 01:21:40,735
What's the matter?
Something wrong out here?

1008
01:21:40,839 --> 01:21:42,329
We're fighting a war, Sam

1009
01:21:42,441 --> 01:21:44,705
A war? Against who?

1010
01:21:44,743 --> 01:21:46,301
Against birds!

1011
01:21:46,345 --> 01:21:48,836
I'm glad you all think this is so amusing

1012
01:21:48,914 --> 01:21:52,111
You've frightened the children half out
of their wits. If the young lady said...

1013
01:21:52,217 --> 01:21:55,152
she saw the attack at a school,
why don't you believe her?

1014
01:21:55,253 --> 01:21:58,154
- What attack? Who attacked the school?
- Birds did. Crows.

1015
01:21:58,256 --> 01:22:00,622
You're all sitting around here debating!

1016
01:22:00,726 --> 01:22:03,058
What do you want them to do next?
Crash through that window?

1017
01:22:03,095 --> 01:22:07,191
- Mommy!
- Ssh. Put on your coat.

1018
01:22:07,666 --> 01:22:10,897
Why don't you all go home,
lock your doors and windows?

1019
01:22:11,003 --> 01:22:12,868
What's the fastest way to San Francisco?

1020
01:22:12,971 --> 01:22:14,461
The freeway, ma'am

1021
01:22:14,573 --> 01:22:16,063
How do I find it?

1022
01:22:16,174 --> 01:22:18,699
I'm going out that way, lady.
You can follow me

1023
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:22,769
- Well then, let's leave now.
- Haven't finished my drink yet.

1024
01:22:23,382 --> 01:22:25,782
I got here as fast as I could.
Where's Cathy?

1025
01:22:25,817 --> 01:22:28,718
- She's with Annie. She's all right.
- Al, why aren't you over at the school,

1026
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:30,310
Where the attack was?

1027
01:22:30,422 --> 01:22:32,617
Because I just got back from
Dan Fawcett's place

1028
01:22:32,691 --> 01:22:35,922
- He was killed last night by birds.
- What?

1029
01:22:36,028 --> 01:22:38,019
Hold it, you don't know that for a fact.

1030
01:22:38,096 --> 01:22:39,620
What are the facts?

1031
01:22:39,698 --> 01:22:42,895
The Santa Rosa Police
think it's a felony murder

1032
01:22:42,934 --> 01:22:44,902
They think a burglar
broke in and killed him.

1033
01:22:44,936 --> 01:22:47,097
How do they explain the
dead birds all over the floor?

1034
01:22:47,205 --> 01:22:50,504
Santa Rosa Police figure they
got in after the old man was killed.

1035
01:22:50,542 --> 01:22:53,102
Were the Santa Rosa
Police at your school today?

1036
01:22:53,145 --> 01:22:56,114
- Are you coming?
- Now take it easy, lady.

1037
01:22:56,148 --> 01:22:58,708
There isn't a bird anywhere in sight!

1038
01:22:58,817 --> 01:23:02,446
"Look at the birds of the
air. They do not sow or reap.

1039
01:23:02,554 --> 01:23:06,251
Yet your Heavenly Father feeds them."

1040
01:23:06,291 --> 01:23:09,089
Something like this
happened in Santa Cruz last year.

1041
01:23:09,194 --> 01:23:11,992
The town was just covered with seagulls.

1042
01:23:12,064 --> 01:23:15,659
- Please finish your drink.
- That's right, sir. I recall it.

1043
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:18,191
A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog,

1044
01:23:18,270 --> 01:23:20,898
and headed into the town
where all the lights were.

1045
01:23:21,006 --> 01:23:24,271
They made some mess, too,
smashing into buildings and everything.

1046
01:23:24,309 --> 01:23:28,803
- They always make a mess.
- The point is that no one seemed
to be upset about it.

1047
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:32,316
They were all gone next morning, just
as though nothing at all had happened.

1048
01:23:32,417 --> 01:23:35,682
- Poor things.
- I'm leaving! Are you coming?

1049
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:37,688
All right, all right!

1050
01:23:39,825 --> 01:23:42,191
Well, hope you folks
figure this thing out!

1051
01:23:42,294 --> 01:23:45,092
It's the end of the world!

1052
01:23:45,197 --> 01:23:47,893
I better get back to the cannery.
What do I owe you, Deke?

1053
01:23:47,999 --> 01:23:48,953
- S...Sebastian, hold it a minute.
- Huh?

1054
01:23:49,810 --> 01:23:51,306
I...I don't want to be an alarmist,

1055
01:23:51,419 --> 01:23:52,915
- but...
- No one ever said you were

1056
01:23:53,027 --> 01:23:55,769
I think we're in real trouble.
I don't know how this started, or why,

1057
01:23:55,876 --> 01:23:58,149
but I know it's here and
we'd be crazy to ignore it.

1058
01:23:58,190 --> 01:24:01,103
- To ignore what? The "bird war"?
- Yes, the "bird war. "

1059
01:24:01,206 --> 01:24:03,239
The bird attack, plague...
Call it what you like,

1060
01:24:03,318 --> 01:24:05,626
they're massing out there someplace,
and they'll be back.

1061
01:24:05,731 --> 01:24:08,644
- Ridiculous.
- C...Come here.

1062
01:24:08,749 --> 01:24:10,279
Unless we do something right now,

1063
01:24:10,358 --> 01:24:12,162
unless we get Bodega Bay on the move,
they...

1064
01:24:12,269 --> 01:24:14,211
Look, Mitch.

1065
01:24:14,313 --> 01:24:17,295
Even if... Even if this is true,
even if all the birds...

1066
01:24:17,398 --> 01:24:21,215
- Don't you believe it's true?
- No, Mitch, frankly I don't.

1067
01:24:21,252 --> 01:24:24,428
- There's no reason I...
- Well, it's happening.
Isn't that a reason?

1068
01:24:24,538 --> 01:24:27,074
- I like Bodega Bay as well as
the next man...
- Fine, then help me.

1069
01:24:27,186 --> 01:24:29,459
You're an important man.
If you help, they all will.

1070
01:24:29,498 --> 01:24:31,702
Help how? What do you want to do?

1071
01:24:31,811 --> 01:24:33,787
Mrs. Bundy said
something about Santa Cruz.

1072
01:24:33,890 --> 01:24:36,700
About seagulls getting lost in a
fog and flying in towards the lights.

1073
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:39,046
- We don't have fog this time of year!
- Make our own fog!

1074
01:24:39,119 --> 01:24:40,717
- How do you figure to do that?
- We can use smoke pots,

1075
01:24:40,829 --> 01:24:42,359
the way the Army uses them.

1076
01:24:42,471 --> 01:24:45,945
Look!

1077
01:24:45,992 --> 01:24:49,809
They're attacking again.
Melanie, you stay in here. Come on, Al!

1078
01:24:54,439 --> 01:24:56,415
Look out!

1079
01:25:25,346 --> 01:25:28,453
Look at the gas.
That man's lighting a cigar!

1080
01:25:30,139 --> 01:25:33,121
Hey, you! Watch out! Don't drop that match!

1081
01:25:33,156 --> 01:25:36,367
- Get out of there!
- Mister, run!

1082
01:26:28,734 --> 01:26:31,110
Hey!

1083
01:28:40,810 --> 01:28:44,718
Why are they doing this?

1084
01:28:44,810 --> 01:28:46,799
Why are they doing this?

1085
01:28:46,911 --> 01:28:51,107
They said when you got here,
the whole thing started!

1086
01:28:53,950 --> 01:28:57,406
Who are you? What are you?

1087
01:28:57,518 --> 01:28:59,711
Where did you come from?

1088
01:29:00,853 --> 01:29:04,048
I think you're the cause of all this.

1089
01:29:04,156 --> 01:29:06,555
I think you're evil! Evil!

1090
01:29:09,159 --> 01:29:11,148
Oh, God!

1091
01:29:15,464 --> 01:29:18,295
I think they're going!

1092
01:29:18,367 --> 01:29:20,356
We can get Cathy at Annie's now.

1093
01:29:54,191 --> 01:29:56,488
The crows again. Shh!

1094
01:30:01,395 --> 01:30:03,384
Come on.

1095
01:30:33,217 --> 01:30:37,208
- Oh, no.
- Stay here. S...Stay here.

1096
01:30:44,924 --> 01:30:48,221
Cathy! Where's Cathy?

1097
01:31:19,983 --> 01:31:22,280
Mitch, don't!

1098
01:31:50,204 --> 01:31:53,000
Oh, don't leave her there, Mitch.

1099
01:32:02,479 --> 01:32:04,844
Oh!

1100
01:32:55,615 --> 01:32:57,581
Come on.

1101
01:32:58,617 --> 01:33:01,482
Shh.

1102
01:33:28,338 --> 01:33:31,772
Wh...When we got back
from taking Michele home...

1103
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:37,068
we...we heard the explosion and we went...

1104
01:33:37,144 --> 01:33:39,736
we went outside to see what it was.

1105
01:33:39,845 --> 01:33:44,542
All...All at once the...
the birds were everywhere!

1106
01:33:44,581 --> 01:33:47,945
All at once she pushed me inside...

1107
01:33:48,050 --> 01:33:49,948
and they covered her!

1108
01:33:50,052 --> 01:33:53,747
Annie... She pushed me inside!

1109
01:34:09,232 --> 01:34:11,198
Give me another one, darling.

1110
01:34:18,205 --> 01:34:20,103
How long have they been gathering there?

1111
01:34:20,206 --> 01:34:22,104
Oh, about 15 minutes.

1112
01:34:26,944 --> 01:34:28,910
Seems like a pattern, doesn't it?

1113
01:34:30,713 --> 01:34:34,147
They strike, then disappear,
and then start massing again.

1114
01:34:42,555 --> 01:34:45,022
Doesn't look so very different, does it?

1115
01:34:45,123 --> 01:34:47,351
A little smoke hanging over the town,
otherwise...

1116
01:34:48,759 --> 01:34:50,918
You want to try your father again?

1117
01:34:51,027 --> 01:34:53,324
No, I tried a little while ago.
The phone's dead.

1118
01:34:53,361 --> 01:34:55,919
- Still got power, haven't we?
- Yes.

1119
01:34:56,031 --> 01:34:58,930
Mitch, I'm getting something on the radio.

1120
01:34:59,033 --> 01:35:01,056
Come on.

1121
01:35:06,071 --> 01:35:09,266
I can't get any of the local stations.

1122
01:35:09,307 --> 01:35:11,296
I think this is San Francisco.

1123
01:35:11,374 --> 01:35:14,899
"...and the work of a team
of professionals. " End quote.

1124
01:35:14,977 --> 01:35:17,467
In Bodega Bay early this morning,
a large flock of crows...

1125
01:35:17,513 --> 01:35:21,003
attacked a group of children who were
leaving the school during a fire drill.

1126
01:35:21,081 --> 01:35:24,571
One little girl was seriously injured
and taken to the hospital in Santa Rosa,

1127
01:35:24,684 --> 01:35:26,912
but the majority of
children reached safety.

1128
01:35:27,018 --> 01:35:29,417
We understand there was
another attack on the town,

1129
01:35:29,486 --> 01:35:31,679
but this information is rather sketchy.

1130
01:35:31,789 --> 01:35:33,687
So far, no word has come through...

1131
01:35:33,790 --> 01:35:36,280
to show if there
have been further attacks.

1132
01:35:36,391 --> 01:35:38,881
On the national scene today,
in Washington...

1133
01:35:38,926 --> 01:35:42,485
Well, is that all?

1134
01:35:42,530 --> 01:35:45,622
I'll have to get some more water.
Mustn't let this fire go out.

1135
01:35:45,698 --> 01:35:49,995
- Did you get the windows in the attic,
Mitch?
- Yes, I got them all, dear.

1136
01:35:50,034 --> 01:35:52,296
- When do you think they'll come?
- I don't know.

1137
01:35:52,402 --> 01:35:54,835
If there are bigger birds, Mitch,
they'll get into the house.

1138
01:35:54,904 --> 01:35:57,700
- Well, it's just a chance we'll
have to take.
- Maybe we ought to leave.

1139
01:35:57,740 --> 01:35:59,706
No, not now!
Not when they're massing out there.

1140
01:35:59,808 --> 01:36:02,036
- When?
- W...We'll just see what happens.

1141
01:36:02,077 --> 01:36:03,634
Where will we go?

1142
01:36:03,677 --> 01:36:06,042
I...I don't know.
I think we're safe here for the time being

1143
01:36:06,079 --> 01:36:08,671
- Let's get the wood in now.
- What happens when you run out of wood?

1144
01:36:08,781 --> 01:36:11,441
- I don't know!
We'll break up the furniture.
- You don't know!

1145
01:36:11,482 --> 01:36:14,449
You don't know! When will you know?
When we're all dead!

1146
01:36:14,485 --> 01:36:18,044
If only your father were here...

1147
01:36:18,487 --> 01:36:22,683
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mitch.

1148
01:36:24,692 --> 01:36:26,851
Make yourself some coffee, won't you?

1149
01:36:30,463 --> 01:36:32,588
"In assuming the tasks of the presidency,

1150
01:36:32,664 --> 01:36:35,392
I said that few generations..."

1151
01:36:41,270 --> 01:36:44,431
- Where are they heading?
- Somewhere inland.

1152
01:36:44,472 --> 01:36:47,667
- Santa Rosa?
- Maybe.

1153
01:36:47,707 --> 01:36:49,673
Come on. Let's get the wood.

1154
01:37:27,635 --> 01:37:31,228
Mitch? Can I bring the lovebirds in here?

1155
01:37:31,337 --> 01:37:32,826
No

1156
01:37:32,937 --> 01:37:36,462
- But, Mom, they're in a cage.
- They're birds, aren't they?

1157
01:37:38,442 --> 01:37:40,932
Let's leave them in the kitchen,
huh, honey?

1158
01:38:28,810 --> 01:38:33,039
Mitch, why are they doing this, the birds?

1159
01:38:33,113 --> 01:38:37,241
- We don't know, honey.
- Why are they trying to kill people?

1160
01:38:37,350 --> 01:38:39,407
I wish I could say.

1161
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:58,433
I...I'm sick, Melanie.

1162
01:40:00,407 --> 01:40:03,805
- I want to...
- I'll go with you.

1163
01:44:38,763 --> 01:44:40,729
They're going.

1164
01:45:52,648 --> 01:45:55,547
Mitch?

1165
01:48:54,372 --> 01:48:56,930
Oh, Mitch!

1166
01:49:14,185 --> 01:49:16,879
Melanie! Melanie!

1167
01:50:02,852 --> 01:50:06,216
Oh, poor thing! Poor thing!

1168
01:50:06,254 --> 01:50:08,551
Listen, get some water,
bandages and antiseptic. Quickly!

1169
01:50:08,622 --> 01:50:10,953
Bandages. It's terrible.

1170
01:50:15,028 --> 01:50:17,017
Cathy, get some brandy.

1171
01:50:28,269 --> 01:50:30,929
- No, no, no!
- No, no, it's all right.

1172
01:50:31,039 --> 01:50:33,028
No, it's all right,
it's all right, it's all right.

1173
01:50:33,140 --> 01:50:36,164
It's all right. It's all right. No.

1174
01:50:36,241 --> 01:50:40,232
No. Shh! Shh!

1175
01:51:04,094 --> 01:51:05,992
Cathy, get the lamp.

1176
01:51:20,705 --> 01:51:22,933
We've got to get her to a hospital.

1177
01:51:23,007 --> 01:51:25,906
- We can't, Mitch.
There's no place we can go.
- There's San Francisco.

1178
01:51:25,942 --> 01:51:28,341
- We'd never make it.
- We have to try.

1179
01:51:28,410 --> 01:51:31,502
We'll go by way of Bay Hill Road.
Then we don't have to go through town.

1180
01:51:31,613 --> 01:51:33,511
We can't stay here. She needs help!

1181
01:51:33,615 --> 01:51:38,312
I'm frightened. Terribly frightened.

1182
01:51:38,417 --> 01:51:41,509
I don't know what's outside there.

1183
01:51:41,621 --> 01:51:44,645
We better get started
before another attack comes.

1184
01:51:44,756 --> 01:51:47,814
We'll take Melanie's car.
That'll be faster than the truck.

1185
01:51:47,924 --> 01:51:50,117
- Can you finish the bandaging?
- I'll try.

1186
01:51:50,225 --> 01:51:52,123
All right.

1187
01:51:58,465 --> 01:52:02,990
Mitch? See if you can get
anything on the car radio.

1188
01:54:01,750 --> 01:54:04,308
The bird attacks have
subsided for the time being.

1189
01:54:04,417 --> 01:54:06,907
Bodega Bay seems to be the center,
though there are reports...

1190
01:54:06,952 --> 01:54:10,852
of minor attacks on
Sebastopol and a few on Santa Rosa.

1191
01:54:10,923 --> 01:54:13,413
Bodega Bay has been
cordoned off by roadblocks.

1192
01:54:13,524 --> 01:54:15,456
Most of the townspeople
have managed to get out,

1193
01:54:15,525 --> 01:54:18,424
but there are still some
isolated pockets of people.

1194
01:54:18,527 --> 01:54:21,925
No decision has been arrived at
yet as to what the next step will be,

1195
01:54:21,963 --> 01:54:25,124
but there's been some discussion as
to whether the military should go in.

1196
01:54:25,232 --> 01:54:28,927
It appears that the bird attacks come
in waves, with long intervals between.

1197
01:54:28,968 --> 01:54:32,629
The reason for this
does not seem clear as yet.

1198
01:56:22,979 --> 01:56:25,002
Did you hear anything on the radio?

1199
01:56:25,081 --> 01:56:27,604
It's-It's all right. Come on.

1200
01:57:05,975 --> 01:57:08,442
No. No!

1201
01:57:08,478 --> 01:57:10,444
Shh. Shh.

1202
01:57:37,597 --> 01:57:40,995
- Mitch?
- Shh!

1203
01:57:41,066 --> 01:57:43,089
Stay there.

1204
01:57:50,472 --> 01:57:52,803
Can I bring the lovebirds, Mitch?

1205
01:57:52,874 --> 01:57:55,102
They haven't harmed anyone.

1206
01:57:55,210 --> 01:57:57,472
A...All right. Bring them.
