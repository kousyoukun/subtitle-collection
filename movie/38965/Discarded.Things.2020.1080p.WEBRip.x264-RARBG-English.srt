know what we do, right?

to our humble place? [chuckles]

489
00:29:12,272 --> 00:29:13,795

the impression that

490
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:16,276
your school needed my services.

491
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:17,886
- We do.

492
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,975

493
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:22,064
Not in a traditional sense.

494
00:29:22,108 --> 00:29:24,458
Most of these kids
are repeat offenders.

495
00:29:24,501 --> 00:29:26,634
We're just trying to
teach 'em the right thing.

496
00:29:26,677 --> 00:29:29,593
It's about survival,
not academics.

497
00:29:29,637 --> 00:29:31,291
They need basic life skills.

498
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:33,162
If we can give 'em that,
keep 'em off the streets,

499
00:29:33,206 --> 00:29:34,598
that's a win for us.

500
00:29:34,642 --> 00:29:36,035

skills. [chuckles]

honest with you.

- When can you start?

517
00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:15,117
- When would you
like me to start?

518
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:16,815
- Today works.

519
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:18,599

you think that it would

520
00:30:18,642 --> 00:30:20,862
be better if I met the
kids then sat in on

521

522
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:25,780
I mean, I don't
know your curriculum

523
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,390
or your schedule or...

524
00:30:27,434 --> 00:30:29,610
- Curriculum? Schedule?

525
00:30:29,653 --> 00:30:32,221
Not what you're expecting, huh?

526
00:30:32,265 --> 00:30:36,573
- That stock image on your
website was a nice touch.

527
00:30:36,617 --> 00:30:39,402
When can I meet the kids?

528
00:30:39,446 --> 00:30:40,403
- Stop.

00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:42,841
[speaks in Spanish]

530
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:44,755
- Man.

531
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:45,974
So somebody speak a
little bit of Spanish,

532
00:30:46,018 --> 00:30:47,541
think she the mom of us.

533
00:30:47,584 --> 00:30:48,759
- Oh my gosh, shut up.
[Jaylen laughs]

534
00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:49,891
- Guys.

535
00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:50,761
- [Jalen] All I'm sayin' is-

536
00:30:50,805 --> 00:30:52,502
- Guys.

537
00:30:52,546 --> 00:30:54,940
This is Ms. Grace.

538
00:30:54,983 --> 00:30:56,202
- That's the lady I saw.

539
00:30:56,245 --> 00:30:57,681
- She's here to
teach you music.

540
00:30:57,725 --> 00:30:59,248
- Uh uh, this is our
free time Miss K.

541
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:00,815
- Yeah.

542
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,599
[phone rings]

543
00:31:02,643 --> 00:31:05,385
- Excuse me, I gotta take
this. I'll be right back.

544
00:31:05,428 --> 00:31:07,691
- I aint sign up
for no music class.

545
00:31:07,735 --> 00:31:10,956
- Good, because this
is music therapy.

546
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:12,871
- We got counselors already.

547
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:15,743
- Music therapy is
a way for you to

548
00:31:15,786 --> 00:31:19,790
express yourselves creatively,
with all kinds of music.

549
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:21,662
- Like you want us to sing?

550
00:31:21,705 --> 00:31:22,924
[sucks teeth]

551
00:31:22,968 --> 00:31:23,751
- Nobody asked
you to sing.

552
00:31:23,794 --> 00:31:24,795
[laughing]

553
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:26,580
- [Jalen] You so rude.

554
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:28,930
- There aren't really any
rules to this kind of music.

555
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:31,411
- Sounds like a waste of time.

556
00:31:31,454 --> 00:31:33,630
- Well could you please
hold your opinion

557
00:31:33,674 --> 00:31:36,546
until you find out
what it's all about?

558
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:39,332
[laughing]

559
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:40,246
- Yo.

560
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:41,595
Yo?

561
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:43,423
King of Devlin. I'm
back, what's up?

562
00:31:43,466 --> 00:31:46,382
- My boy, welcome back.
- What's up, what's up?

563
00:31:46,426 --> 00:31:47,209
What's good, dog?

564
00:31:47,253 --> 00:31:49,081
[hits]

565
00:31:49,124 --> 00:31:50,952
[laughing]

566
00:31:50,996 --> 00:31:53,694
Aye.
- That's not funny, bro.

567
00:31:53,737 --> 00:31:54,782
- Yo, I'm not cleaning that up.

568
00:31:54,825 --> 00:31:56,175
Y'all got me messed up.

569
00:31:56,218 --> 00:31:57,698
- Bro, she been here
for two seconds.

570
00:31:57,741 --> 00:31:59,352
- You act like you
don't know me now?

571
00:31:59,395 --> 00:32:00,919
What's up, you not gonna
give me no love or nothin'?

572
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:03,573
- Nah, bruh, what's
good with it?

573
00:32:03,617 --> 00:32:05,271
You got coffee in
your hair and junk.

574
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:06,402
Let's see that
bling, let's see it.

575
00:32:06,446 --> 00:32:07,882
- Run it, run it.

576
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,014
- [Jalen] My god,
yeah, I like it bro.

577
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:10,406
Does it itch?

578
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:11,581
- [Kimberly] All
right, thank you.

579
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:13,018
- How do you do this?

580
00:32:13,061 --> 00:32:15,759
[sighs]

581
00:32:15,803 --> 00:32:17,761
- Okay, look.

582
00:32:17,805 --> 00:32:19,415
It takes some getting used to.

583
00:32:19,459 --> 00:32:20,939
But I promise you
that if you just--

584
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:23,942
- This was a mistake.

585
00:32:23,985 --> 00:32:27,249
- The kids mean well, you just-

586
00:32:27,293 --> 00:32:31,297
- And you call this helping me.

587
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,689
- Grace, please,
what can we do?

588
00:32:32,733 --> 00:32:36,041
- Nothing. I'm fine, thank you.

589
00:32:36,084 --> 00:32:38,521
- What? She said she's fine.

590
00:32:38,565 --> 00:32:41,350
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

591
00:32:41,394 --> 00:32:44,397
Is it the schedule?

592
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,399
- And you think this is funny?

593
00:32:46,442 --> 00:32:49,924
I have taught ambassador's
kids, and one time a prince.

594
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,970
- Look, Jalen's
dad used to run one

595
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:53,797
of the hardest
gangs on this block,

596
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:57,453
so for real, for
real, we royalty too.

597
00:32:57,497 --> 00:32:59,760
You know my wife can make
a bad cup of coffee,

598
00:32:59,803 --> 00:33:01,109
but you aint have
to do all that.

599
00:33:01,153 --> 00:33:04,417
You could've just
thrown it away.

600
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,767
They're kids, they're
gonna act out.

601
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,508
I think someone from
where you're from,

602
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:10,771
what is it, music
therapy, or whatever,

603
00:33:10,814 --> 00:33:14,427
would be more in tune with
how these at risk teens act.

604
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:17,734
- My students have taught
kids from all over the world

605
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:21,782
because of the skills
I knew to teach them,

606
00:33:21,825 --> 00:33:24,263
and you don't think I'm
qualified enough for you?

607
00:33:24,306 --> 00:33:26,743
- Paper says you qualified,
but it take way more

608
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:28,049
than that to last.
- You don't have a schedule,

609
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:30,834
you don't have curriculum.

610
00:33:30,878 --> 00:33:35,535
You, I'm assuming, don't
have money for supplies.

611
00:33:35,578 --> 00:33:38,059
- All the money goes to
the fancy universities

612
00:33:38,103 --> 00:33:39,713
like the one you came from.

613
00:33:39,756 --> 00:33:41,497
Look, we got a
saying around here:

614
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:43,543
meet them where they are at.

615
00:33:43,586 --> 00:33:45,284
- And then?

616
00:33:45,327 --> 00:33:47,460
Because I'm pretty sure
I've already done that.

617
00:33:47,503 --> 00:33:48,896
- And that's it.

618
00:33:48,939 --> 00:33:51,507
Anything past
that is a calling.

619
00:33:51,551 --> 00:33:53,118
So where we goin'?

620
00:33:54,554 --> 00:33:57,339
[Grace scoffs]

621
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:01,430
[birds chirping]

622
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,520
Uh, hello?

623
00:34:06,435 --> 00:34:08,698
I'll get these.

624
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:11,614
[birds chirping]

625
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:18,012
- So we don't
usually have guests.

626
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,580
Oh wow.

627
00:34:20,623 --> 00:34:24,236
I thought the kids had
it cleaned in here.

628
00:34:25,802 --> 00:34:26,934
[Grace coughs]
You know what,

629
00:34:26,977 --> 00:34:28,240
I could send some of them over.

630
00:34:28,283 --> 00:34:30,851
- No, that's fine. That's okay.

631
00:34:30,894 --> 00:34:32,331
- You sure?
- Mhm.

632
00:34:32,374 --> 00:34:34,246
- I really don't mind.

633
00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:36,335
I mean, they could clean up
some more, really, honestly.

634
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:39,294
[Clears throat]

635
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:42,558
Okay.

636
00:34:42,602 --> 00:34:46,345
Grace, I'm really
glad you're here.

637
00:34:46,388 --> 00:34:50,175
I think you'll be good
for us. [chuckles]

638
00:34:50,218 --> 00:34:51,350
Okay.

639
00:34:53,743 --> 00:34:55,397
All right.

640
00:34:55,441 --> 00:34:59,401
Well, get some rest.
Tomorrow's a new day.

641
00:34:59,445 --> 00:35:03,101
And again, thanks for
give us another shot.

642
00:35:05,494 --> 00:35:07,105
All right.

643
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:10,760
[door closes]

644
00:35:11,631 --> 00:35:15,287
[soft music]

645
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,940
- Just meet them
where they're at.

646
00:35:16,984 --> 00:35:18,290
- [Selina] 'Cause little
miss thing over there

647
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:19,595
wouldn't let me
sleep last night.

648
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:21,771
- Are you serious?
- Come on.

649
00:35:22,598 --> 00:35:24,165
- Good afternoon.

650
00:35:26,036 --> 00:35:27,908
- [Q] You know it is.

651
00:35:29,779 --> 00:35:31,912
- No coffee today?

652
00:35:31,955 --> 00:35:33,653
- I can't get with this.

653
00:35:33,696 --> 00:35:34,567
- Run that.

654
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:35,916
- It's trash.

655
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:37,222
- What?
- It's trash.

656
00:35:37,265 --> 00:35:38,223
- That is not trash.

657
00:35:38,266 --> 00:35:39,746
Trash is-

658
00:35:39,789 --> 00:35:42,227
- So, um, what is
good music to you?

659
00:35:44,272 --> 00:35:45,969
- I don't know.

660
00:35:46,013 --> 00:35:47,232
You just know.

661
00:35:49,799 --> 00:35:52,237
It's definitely not that.

662
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,803
- What about you?

663
00:35:55,065 --> 00:35:56,589
- What about me what?

664
00:35:56,632 --> 00:35:59,635
- What do you
consider good music?

665
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,205
Is it the song or the artist?

666
00:36:04,249 --> 00:36:07,687
Do the lyrics move
you in a certain way?

667
00:36:08,992 --> 00:36:11,212
What do you get from it?

668
00:36:11,256 --> 00:36:12,735
- It's not about what we get,

669
00:36:12,779 --> 00:36:14,781
it's about what we
don't have to get.

670
00:36:14,824 --> 00:36:18,219
Some of us don't wanna be
in our feelings all day.

671
00:36:18,263 --> 00:36:21,135
- So, music is the escape?

672
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,529
- There's a lot worse
things than music.

673
00:36:23,572 --> 00:36:26,401
Uh, the people
you use to escape.

674
00:36:27,272 --> 00:36:28,360
- True.

675
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:31,493
It's a healthy distraction.

676
00:36:31,537 --> 00:36:34,583
But on the other side of that,

677
00:36:34,627 --> 00:36:39,327
music can help us feel or
make sense of our emotions.

678
00:36:39,371 --> 00:36:43,157
- Like, for me, I,
I like listening to

679
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:48,249
my favorite songs because
it makes me feel less alone.

680
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:49,729
- So loneliness.

681
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:52,384
What else?

682
00:36:52,427 --> 00:36:56,344
- Um, music is one of
the only things that

683
00:36:56,388 --> 00:36:59,869
doesn't ask for anything we
don't wanna give, I guess.

684
00:36:59,913 --> 00:37:01,741
- [Grace] How so?

685
00:37:01,784 --> 00:37:03,482
- We can listen to
it when we want to,

686
00:37:03,525 --> 00:37:05,397
turn it off when we don't
wanna hear it anymore.

687
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,789
We can either get
something from it,

688
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:09,139
or get nothing at
all, it just is.

689
00:37:09,183 --> 00:37:11,446
It lets us choose
how we wanna respond

690
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,579
without telling
us how we should.

691
00:37:13,622 --> 00:37:15,363
I guess, I don't know.

692
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:18,279
- That's pretty insightful.

693
00:37:18,323 --> 00:37:19,933
[scoffs]

694
00:37:19,976 --> 00:37:21,413
Do you disagree?

695
00:37:24,067 --> 00:37:26,331
- Just don't care.

696
00:37:26,374 --> 00:37:27,419
Just wondering
if there's a point

697
00:37:27,462 --> 00:37:29,377
to all of this or what?

698
00:37:29,421 --> 00:37:31,249
- Yo, chill.
- Please.

699
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:34,077
Like y'all aint
wondering the same thing.

700
00:37:34,121 --> 00:37:35,775
This supposed to be
our time to kick back

701
00:37:35,818 --> 00:37:38,212
and not deal with somebody
else talking at us.

702
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,259
- Well you know there have
been studies that suggest

703
00:37:41,302 --> 00:37:44,436
that babies in their
mother's wombs can hear

704
00:37:44,479 --> 00:37:46,742
and even recognize
the music that

705
00:37:46,786 --> 00:37:48,527
their mothers play for them.

706
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,442
It can be a song, it
can be humming a song--

707
00:37:50,485 --> 00:37:52,531
- Don't talk to
me about my baby.

708
00:37:52,574 --> 00:37:54,881
- Look, I was just trying-
- That's your problem.

709
00:37:54,924 --> 00:37:57,449
Stop. Like, are you
even a real teacher?

710
00:37:57,492 --> 00:38:00,626
'Cause I aint heard
nothin' yet that matters.

711
00:38:00,669 --> 00:38:03,237
- [Grace] What
does matter to you?

712
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,413
- Not this.

713
00:38:05,457 --> 00:38:07,807
- Well maybe not today,
but what about the future?

714
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,417
[chuckles]

715
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:13,029
That maybe later, one
day, what you learn

716
00:38:13,073 --> 00:38:16,076
here can impact your life.

717
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:18,600
What you gonna do when
you leave this place,

718
00:38:18,644 --> 00:38:20,733
who you're going to be.

719
00:38:20,776 --> 00:38:25,912
A life outside of anything
you've ever known.

720
00:38:25,955 --> 00:38:30,917
Doing big things that you
never thought you could do.

721
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,222
[scoffs]

722
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:33,702
- Big?

723
00:38:33,746 --> 00:38:35,356
That aint us.

724
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,011
We just trying to make
it through every day.

725
00:38:38,054 --> 00:38:39,752
- I can't even leave the house.

726
00:38:39,795 --> 00:38:42,624
- Look, Ms. Grace, was
it? We know our options.

727
00:38:42,668 --> 00:38:45,105
- Yup, and they suck.

728
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:49,109
- Well then I've got
an important assignment

729
00:38:49,152 --> 00:38:50,937
for you to do tonight.
[Jaylen scoffs]

730
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,460
- Wait, hold up, now she's
talking about assignment.

731
00:38:52,504 --> 00:38:54,201
Can someone please
tell this lady

732
00:38:54,244 --> 00:38:57,552
that we don't do homework here?

733
00:38:57,596 --> 00:39:00,250
- Facts.
- Yeah.

734
00:39:00,294 --> 00:39:01,904
- Are you telling me that
if I give you an assignment,

735
00:39:01,948 --> 00:39:05,255
you're not-
- No, no one would do it.

736
00:39:05,299 --> 00:39:08,084
I'm not trying to
be mean, but...

737
00:39:08,128 --> 00:39:10,652
- Not one of you
even wants to try?

738
00:39:10,696 --> 00:39:12,219
- I'm good.
- No.

739
00:39:12,262 --> 00:39:14,569
- You're just happy
doing nothing?

740
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:16,832
- We do what we gotta
do to stay here.

741
00:39:16,876 --> 00:39:19,922
Why would we do
something we aint gotta?

742
00:39:19,966 --> 00:39:23,186
- Why indeed.

743
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:30,019
[birds chirping]

744
00:39:34,459 --> 00:39:36,330
I did what you said.

745
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,637
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

746
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,161
But where they're
at is a problem.

747
00:39:41,204 --> 00:39:42,858
- Huh?

748
00:39:42,902 --> 00:39:45,731
- You told me to meet them
where they're at. I did.

749
00:39:45,774 --> 00:39:48,560
But where they're
at is a problem.

750
00:39:48,603 --> 00:39:51,911
- Oh, I see. See, I
thought we hired a teacher.

751
00:39:51,954 --> 00:39:54,043
But it seems like we
just hired a judge.

752
00:39:54,087 --> 00:39:57,090
- No, what you did
was hire the sitter.

753
00:39:57,133 --> 00:39:58,744
That's what this is.

754
00:39:58,787 --> 00:40:00,354
- Look, I don't have
time to give you

755
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,356
a pep talk every time
something happens.

756
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,271
It's the job.

757
00:40:04,314 --> 00:40:06,752
First it was too hard for you,
now it's too easy for you.

758
00:40:06,795 --> 00:40:08,928
What do you want?

759
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:12,279
- I want to help.
- Well then help.

760
00:40:16,762 --> 00:40:18,372
- I mean I'll trade you this-
- Look, I'm just saying,

761
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,939
then keep your door closed.

762
00:40:19,982 --> 00:40:21,897
- Hey, if I wanna leave
my door open, it's open.

763
00:40:21,941 --> 00:40:23,203
[laughing]

764
00:40:23,246 --> 00:40:24,639
- Hey.

765
00:40:24,683 --> 00:40:27,642
- Are we having a sleep over?

766
00:40:27,686 --> 00:40:29,035
- [Q] Come on with
your big head.

767
00:40:29,078 --> 00:40:30,645
- You can't talk
for nobody, dog.

768
00:40:30,689 --> 00:40:33,213
Have you seen that
thing you carry around?

769
00:40:33,256 --> 00:40:35,433
- Will you be joining us?

770
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:39,567
Is everyone comfortable?

771
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:41,917
- Of course.
- I could use another pillow.

772
00:40:41,961 --> 00:40:43,745
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

773
00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:45,486
Yeah. [laughs]

774
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,096
- I'll catch one.

775
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,272
[laughing]

776
00:40:49,316 --> 00:40:55,235
- Yes, this is really nice.

777
00:40:55,278 --> 00:40:56,932
Ah.

778
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:02,590
And to think, I was
worried about what

779
00:41:02,634 --> 00:41:04,897
you all thought about me.

780
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,421
[Grace chuckles]

781
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:12,905
Racking my brain with what
I could do to help you,

782
00:41:12,948 --> 00:41:17,257
or where I would go
if I decided to leave.

783
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,608
And then it finally
occurred to me:

784
00:41:20,652 --> 00:41:26,571
I don't have to think about
any of this stuff. [laughs]

785
00:41:26,614 --> 00:41:27,920
- She's loosing it.

786
00:41:27,963 --> 00:41:32,968
- Not if I have one
of those passes.

787
00:41:33,012 --> 00:41:36,406
Oh, you know what
I'm talking about?

788
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:39,540
Because you all have
them, the passes.

789
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,934
- We don't have any passes?

790
00:41:41,977 --> 00:41:44,980
- Oh, I'm not
gonna tell anybody.

791
00:41:45,024 --> 00:41:47,940
Just tell me where
you got the passes.

792
00:41:47,983 --> 00:41:50,551
- We stole 'em.
[laughing]

793
00:41:50,595 --> 00:41:52,510
- Um, passes for what?

794
00:41:53,467 --> 00:41:55,469
- The passes on life.

795
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:59,299
The free passes that
say that all you

796
00:41:59,342 --> 00:42:03,390
have to do is show up
and that's good enough.

797
00:42:03,433 --> 00:42:08,438
The passes that say you
don't have to do the work.

798
00:42:08,482 --> 00:42:12,660
You talk a tough game.

799
00:42:12,704 --> 00:42:16,577
And you almost had
me for a minute.

800
00:42:16,621 --> 00:42:19,493
You intimidate and
you make your threats

801
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,539
and you demand respect.

802
00:42:23,758 --> 00:42:26,761
But when it comes time to
stand up for yourselves,

803
00:42:26,805 --> 00:42:29,024
you throw up your
hands and you back into

804
00:42:29,068 --> 00:42:32,332
the corner and you cry
and you oh, I'm scared,

805
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:35,378
I can't do this, it's too hard.

806
00:42:35,422 --> 00:42:36,815
- We know how to fight.
- Yeah.

807
00:42:36,858 --> 00:42:38,468
- No you don't.

808
00:42:38,512 --> 00:42:40,601
Not for yourselves.

809
00:42:40,645 --> 00:42:43,822
Now, you may have
been victimized.

810
00:42:43,865 --> 00:42:45,780
No fault of your own.

811
00:42:45,824 --> 00:42:52,439
And you may not have family,
friends, a $1.50 to your name.

812
00:42:52,482 --> 00:42:56,356
But you do have something,
something so powerful

813
00:42:56,399 --> 00:43:01,230
that no one can ever
take away from you.

814
00:43:01,274 --> 00:43:03,232
- What's that? Our
court records, right?

815
00:43:03,276 --> 00:43:04,277
[laughing]

816
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,497
- [Grace] Choice.

817
00:43:07,541 --> 00:43:12,067
- Most of us were sent
here. It wasn't our choice.

818
00:43:12,111 --> 00:43:14,461
- That's not how it
is for most of us.

819
00:43:14,504 --> 00:43:17,464
Even if we wanna move on,

820
00:43:17,507 --> 00:43:20,293
the world doesn't
just let you forget.

821
00:43:20,336 --> 00:43:24,079
- But you still have a choice,

822
00:43:24,123 --> 00:43:28,083
to not let it define one
more moment of your lives.

823
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,695
Just stop believing
the lies that this

824
00:43:30,738 --> 00:43:32,653
is all that there is.

825
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:37,266
You stand up and fight. Stand
up and fight for yourselves!

826
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:41,619
[sighs]

827
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:43,403
Now...

828
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:51,106
You, you, you can just give up.

829
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:57,809
You can let the world, and
all of the bad people in it,

830
00:43:57,852 --> 00:44:01,682
determine your
future, and this class

831
00:44:01,726 --> 00:44:04,467
will be your nap time.

832
00:44:04,511 --> 00:44:08,428
But if you decide to
stand up for yourselves,

833
00:44:10,604 --> 00:44:13,520
stand up and fight
for yourselves

834
00:44:13,563 --> 00:44:19,482
and do something positive
with all of that negativity,

835
00:44:19,526 --> 00:44:25,663
all of that pain,
you just let me know.

836
00:44:27,186 --> 00:44:32,321
Now my future is good, no
matter what you decide.

837
00:44:33,932 --> 00:44:36,499
[soft music]

838
00:44:39,372 --> 00:44:44,507
You just let me know.
[soft music]

839
00:44:51,906 --> 00:44:53,081
Yes.

840
00:44:54,648 --> 00:44:56,432
This is good.

841
00:44:56,476 --> 00:44:58,608
- You said what?
- Michael.

842
00:44:58,652 --> 00:45:01,002
- If we only expect
the minimum from them,

843
00:45:01,046 --> 00:45:02,743
that is all we're going to get.

844
00:45:02,787 --> 00:45:04,527
And then they will never,
ever know that they

845
00:45:04,571 --> 00:45:06,573
are capable of so much more.

846
00:45:06,616 --> 00:45:08,183
- Now she's telling
me how to do my job.

847
00:45:08,227 --> 00:45:10,055
Unbelievable.

848
00:45:10,098 --> 00:45:12,361
You don't just walk up
in somebody house, Grace,

849
00:45:12,405 --> 00:45:14,320
and start telling
them how to clean it.

850
00:45:14,363 --> 00:45:18,367
- I didn't just walk in.
I was invited to stay.

851
00:45:18,411 --> 00:45:21,588
- Exactly. Key word:
"invited".

852
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:23,416
I should've let
you walk that day.

853
00:45:23,459 --> 00:45:26,419
- Michael!
- Then why didn't you?

854
00:45:26,462 --> 00:45:27,899
[Michael sighs]

855
00:45:27,942 --> 00:45:29,335
- Look.

856
00:45:31,424 --> 00:45:33,078
I know these kids.

857
00:45:33,121 --> 00:45:35,733
I know what it's like
to be one of these kids.

858
00:45:35,776 --> 00:45:37,909
They don't call 'em
at risk for nothin'.

859
00:45:37,952 --> 00:45:39,737
Last thing they need is
somebody coming in here

860
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,783
sellin' 'em dreams,
tellin' 'em more lies,

861
00:45:42,827 --> 00:45:44,524
leading to more disappointment.

862
00:45:44,567 --> 00:45:48,571
- Everybody's at risk of
something, Mr. Devlin.

863
00:45:48,615 --> 00:45:50,225
That's life.

864
00:45:50,269 --> 00:45:52,532
But we just can't, we
can't grow complacent

865
00:45:52,575 --> 00:45:54,752
and not try to do better.

866
00:45:55,796 --> 00:45:57,450
- Oh, I get it.

867
00:45:57,493 --> 00:45:58,712
This some of that old
recovery talk, aint it?

868
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,496
What are you, 90
days clean now?

869
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,063
- Okay, Michael,
that is enough.

870
00:46:02,107 --> 00:46:03,891
What has gotten into you?

871
00:46:03,935 --> 00:46:06,241
You of all people
should know better.

872
00:46:06,285 --> 00:46:08,287
Okay, this house would
not be in existence

873
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:10,332
if you just settled
for less and stopped

- Mr. Devlin.

You, you've have a
problem with me from the

to please people.

You stuck me in
the room with them,

890
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:02,689

891

sent us a 13-year-old boy.

907
00:48:07,232 --> 00:48:09,930
He couldn't speak,
he stared at walls,

couldn't even feed himself.

And it's not like he couldn't.

You look at his
early school records,

912
00:48:18,852 --> 00:48:21,202
it shows that he
was a smart kid.

913
00:48:21,246 --> 00:48:25,119
But whatever happened to
him at his parent's house?

914
00:48:25,163 --> 00:48:27,948
Completely checked out.

915
00:48:27,992 --> 00:48:30,255

all their credentials,

916
00:48:30,298 --> 00:48:32,431

him, keep pushin' him,

917
00:48:32,474 --> 00:48:33,998
don't go easy on him.

918
00:48:34,041 --> 00:48:37,262
They said if we did,
he'd never recover.

919
00:48:37,305 --> 00:48:40,178
You can't argue with these
doctors, so that's what we did.

920
00:48:40,221 --> 00:48:43,964
For a year straight, all we
did was focus on results.

921

No visible sign of success.

922
00:48:46,271 --> 00:48:48,229
You know what they
told us to do?

923
00:48:48,273 --> 00:48:49,752
Just get rid of him.

924
00:48:49,796 --> 00:48:52,755

were called to do was love him.

have told you.

we could talk this out.

talk about the situation?

What are y'all doin'
to stop this, huh?

We're all family, and if

she kept me around
was for the check.

a friend, a true one.

just hear me out,

Devlin House is everything

1392

that we used to dream
about being a part of.

that we've chosen

That was your idea
from the beginning.

You want us to just
set those aside

with a handful of kids

1398

meet the kids.

That's the last thing you

sale or a raffle or somethin'?

Isn't that what people
do when they need money?

kind of edibles

have a point, though.

I can't be caught
with anything.

I'm talking about a fundraiser.

- Yeah, no disrespect, but
that's a terrible idea.

1425
01:16:13,046 --> 01:16:15,745
- Yeah, Ms. Grace, and
you promised us no choir.

1426
01:16:15,788 --> 01:16:17,616
- A showcase, then.

And Tay, I've seen
your paintings.

You are amazing.

We can sell your artwork.

And I'm sure that
there's at least someone

1435
01:16:35,895 --> 01:16:37,331
here who can sing.

1436
01:16:37,375 --> 01:16:39,420

get this straight.

1437
01:16:39,464 --> 01:16:42,206
You want us to do all of
this for Daniella, right?

1438
01:16:42,249 --> 01:16:43,511

1439

- Nope.

- Look, you all
want to be safe.

1444
01:16:54,784 --> 01:16:57,743
We can raise enough money
to go out on our own

1445
01:16:57,787 --> 01:17:00,528
so that we're no longer
underneath this organization

1446
01:17:00,572 --> 01:17:04,663
that doesn't care about you
the way that the Devlin's do.

1447
01:17:04,707 --> 01:17:07,361
And, at the very
least, we can gain some

1448

happening with Daniella,

01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:32,746
- I wish you had
told me about Eric.

1553
01:23:34,661 --> 01:23:38,926
- Mama, you've got enough
to deal with right now.

1554
01:23:43,105 --> 01:23:44,932
- Here, I'ma give you
some more of this cake.

1555
01:23:44,976 --> 01:23:46,499
- Oh mama.
- Come on, you can do it.

1556
01:23:46,543 --> 01:23:48,327
- But mama.
[chuckling]

1557
01:23:48,371 --> 01:23:51,287
It is so, ooh, so good.

1558
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:53,550
Oh, goodness gracious.

1559
01:23:53,593 --> 01:23:57,554
You know, I can't even
remember the last time

1560
01:23:57,597 --> 01:24:00,339
I got to enjoy
your cooking, mm.

1561
01:24:01,123 --> 01:24:02,080
- Oh.

1562
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:06,693
It was a beautiful
Sunday morning.

1563
01:24:06,737 --> 01:24:10,219
It was just a little
piece of spring in tHe air

1564
01:24:10,262 --> 01:24:14,571
and I made apple sauce.

1565
01:24:14,614 --> 01:24:17,182
I cut the apples up myself.

1566
01:24:17,226 --> 01:24:19,750
And bacon.

1567
01:24:19,793 --> 01:24:23,928
And scrambled eggs,
the way you like it.

1568
01:24:25,277 --> 01:24:28,933
I made, uh, hash browns.

1569
01:24:28,976 --> 01:24:32,676
And ooh, my famous gravy.

1570
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:36,419
Oh yeah, it was beautiful,
a beautiful day.

1571
01:24:39,987 --> 01:24:43,078
- Mama, you know
I had no choice.

1572
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:47,734
He pushed me out.

1573
01:24:47,778 --> 01:24:52,913
And my only regret is that
you wouldn't come with me.

1574
01:25:02,271 --> 01:25:05,709
- He needs to see you.

1575
01:25:06,536 --> 01:25:09,713
[soft music]

1576
01:25:16,502 --> 01:25:21,638
[tense music]

1577
01:25:41,266 --> 01:25:43,225
- Where is it?

1578
01:25:43,268 --> 01:25:46,315
What did you do?

1579
01:25:46,358 --> 01:25:49,100
Answer me!
Where is my picture?

1580
01:25:50,623 --> 01:25:53,104
- I'll take some more juice.

1581
01:25:55,019 --> 01:25:56,586
[glass shatters]

1582
01:25:56,629 --> 01:25:58,892
- It's not enough that
you took him away?

1583
01:25:58,936 --> 01:26:01,460
You have to take
everything from me?

1584
01:26:01,504 --> 01:26:03,419
Why?

1585
01:26:03,462 --> 01:26:07,640
[tense music]

1586
01:26:12,297 --> 01:26:14,169
- Clean this mess up.

1587
01:26:15,257 --> 01:26:18,477
Gotta get ready for church.

1588
01:26:23,221 --> 01:26:24,179
- Mama.

1589
01:26:28,574 --> 01:26:30,620
- Get ready for church.

1590
01:26:32,578 --> 01:26:38,715
[melancholy music]

1591
01:27:11,138 --> 01:27:12,227
- Grace.

1592
01:27:15,752 --> 01:27:17,536
It is you.

1593
01:27:19,277 --> 01:27:22,193
Come a little closer.

1594
01:27:26,893 --> 01:27:29,896
I knew you'd come
back before...

1595
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:32,290
- What did you do with him?

1596
01:27:32,334 --> 01:27:35,902
I don't have time to pretend.

1597
01:27:35,946 --> 01:27:38,731
What did you do with my baby?

1598
01:27:41,430 --> 01:27:44,563
You know. You tell
me who took him.

1599
01:27:47,131 --> 01:27:49,264
Just give me that.

1600
01:27:50,961 --> 01:27:53,877
- I don't, I don't know.

1601
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:58,447
- You are the most
selfish man I've ever met.

1602
01:27:58,490 --> 01:28:00,100
- [Solomon] Grace.

1603
01:28:01,885 --> 01:28:05,497
- What did you do with my baby?

1604
01:28:07,369 --> 01:28:09,109
- I don't know.

1605
01:28:10,676 --> 01:28:12,939
I signed papers.

1606
01:28:15,115 --> 01:28:18,075
It said you were
to give him away.

1607
01:28:18,989 --> 01:28:21,252
I'm sorry, Grace.

1608
01:28:22,122 --> 01:28:24,081
I'm sorry, Grace.

1609
01:28:26,257 --> 01:28:28,999
I'm sorry for everything.

1610
01:28:29,042 --> 01:28:30,653
- I'm sorry?

1611
01:28:33,395 --> 01:28:36,180
You can destroy
a person's life,

1612
01:28:38,530 --> 01:28:43,535
your only child.
your daughter,

1613
01:28:43,579 --> 01:28:46,712
just like that,

1614
01:28:46,756 --> 01:28:49,541
and then what, one
day you see the light

1615
01:28:49,585 --> 01:28:53,763
and you think that I
am sorry is enough?

1616
01:28:56,983 --> 01:29:03,816
- I don't deserve to be
forgiven for what I've done.

1617
01:29:06,297 --> 01:29:08,517
I deserve this.

1618
01:29:16,873 --> 01:29:24,750
- I forgive you,
Pastor Solomon Grant.

1619
01:29:29,451 --> 01:29:30,713
I forgive you.

1620
01:29:32,758 --> 01:29:37,894
[staggered breathing]

1621
01:29:52,952 --> 01:29:56,913
[Jalen yelling]

1622
01:29:56,956 --> 01:29:58,567
- You can't leave me
in this house, man.

1623
01:29:58,610 --> 01:30:00,482
- Listen, bro, we love you bro.

1624
01:30:00,525 --> 01:30:01,961
- Get out
of my face, man!

1625
01:30:02,005 --> 01:30:02,745
- We're here for you.
[Jalen yelling]

1626
01:30:02,788 --> 01:30:04,224
It's okay.

1627
01:30:04,268 --> 01:30:05,748
- You can't keep me
in this house!

1628
01:30:05,791 --> 01:30:07,053
- It's okay, I
understand, I'm sorry.

1629
01:30:07,097 --> 01:30:10,317
I'm sorry.
[Jalen yelling]

1630
01:30:11,536 --> 01:30:13,277
- What, sweetie?
- Ms. Grace.

1631
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:16,062
- What, what, what?

1632
01:30:16,106 --> 01:30:17,499
- You can't keep me
in this house.

1633
01:30:17,542 --> 01:30:18,717
Get out
of my face, man.

1634
01:30:18,761 --> 01:30:21,154
- Jalen. Jalen, what's wrong?

1635
01:30:21,198 --> 01:30:23,243
What's wrong,
honey? What's wrong?

1636
01:30:23,287 --> 01:30:25,507
[Jalen sobbing]

1637
01:30:25,550 --> 01:30:26,725
- She's dead.

1638
01:30:28,945 --> 01:30:31,426
My mom is dead.
- Oh, baby.

1639
01:30:31,469 --> 01:30:34,385
Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.

1640
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:35,647
I am so sorry.

1641
01:30:39,564 --> 01:30:41,653
- They told me that
she wanted to see me,

1642
01:30:41,697 --> 01:30:45,831
but she just, she just
wanted another fix.

1643
01:30:45,875 --> 01:30:47,877
She got what she wanted,
and it killed her.

1644
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:49,879
- Oh, sweetie.

1645
01:30:49,922 --> 01:30:53,099
No, no. No, no,
no, no, sweetheart.

1646
01:30:53,143 --> 01:30:55,058
It's not your fault.

1647
01:30:55,101 --> 01:30:59,541
It is not your fault,
and as hard as it is,

1648
01:30:59,584 --> 01:31:05,634
as hard as it is, you're
gonna have to forgive her.

1649
01:31:05,677 --> 01:31:07,070
It's all right.

1650
01:31:08,767 --> 01:31:10,900
I've got you.

1651
01:31:12,771 --> 01:31:17,907
[soft piano music]

1652
01:31:40,059 --> 01:31:43,106
- My father was king of the
streets, so I'm royalty.

1653
01:31:43,149 --> 01:31:45,456
My mother was his queen,
but she fell hard.

1654
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:48,633
It's crazy how you change
and substances get involved.

1655
01:31:48,677 --> 01:31:50,243
She said she loved me
with her whole heart

1656
01:31:50,287 --> 01:31:52,158
but the love never got to me.

1657
01:31:52,202 --> 01:31:54,726
I guess it got clogged behind
the drugs in her arteries.

1658
01:31:54,770 --> 01:31:56,467
She left me low
while she got high,

1659
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:58,556
'til I was at a make
shift grave saying goodbye

1660
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:00,776
with her ashes in a can.

1661
01:32:00,819 --> 01:32:02,299
My dad was in jail,
then he was free,

1662
01:32:02,342 --> 01:32:03,648
then he was shot
like the next day,

1663
01:32:03,692 --> 01:32:05,520
so what's that say to me?

1664
01:32:05,563 --> 01:32:07,826
By the time I was eight, I
was with a foster family,

1665
01:32:07,870 --> 01:32:10,960
by nine, it was another,
until I was put in a house

1666
01:32:11,003 --> 01:32:13,397
that turned into a home
and became a family,

1667
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,138
so now I'm not alone.

1668
01:32:15,181 --> 01:32:16,748
To let go of the pain, I
put my heart into my writing

1669
01:32:16,792 --> 01:32:18,402
and I let my soul explain.

1670
01:32:18,445 --> 01:32:20,535
Now this boy's no longer
a child and this man,

1671
01:32:20,578 --> 01:32:22,406
he will proclaim.

1672
01:32:22,449 --> 01:32:24,800
I just proclaim someone out
there hears what I'm sayin'

1673
01:32:24,843 --> 01:32:27,716
and they can see the old me
is gone and now I'm changin'.

1674
01:32:27,759 --> 01:32:30,762
Step by step, I
strive to maintain it.

1675
01:32:30,806 --> 01:32:33,156
And that's the story
of Harris-comma-Jalen.

1676
01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:37,726
[cheering]
[applause]

1677
01:32:41,817 --> 01:32:44,863
- I want you to know that
we are not asking you

1678
01:32:44,907 --> 01:32:48,214
to give what you don't have.

1679
01:32:48,258 --> 01:32:50,739
But we are asking
that you pray,

1680
01:32:50,782 --> 01:32:53,829
and that you give
what you can give.

1681
01:32:53,872 --> 01:32:56,309
That you will volunteer.

1682
01:32:56,353 --> 01:33:00,444
That you will make this
community the community

1683
01:33:00,487 --> 01:33:02,707
that you want it to be.

1684
01:33:02,751 --> 01:33:05,623
We're asking you
to take it back.

1685
01:33:05,667 --> 01:33:09,845
Because when we do
invest in each other,

1686
01:33:09,888 --> 01:33:13,239
then we determine our future.

1687
01:33:15,633 --> 01:33:20,246
[cheering]
[applause]

1688
01:33:22,553 --> 01:33:24,903
- Grace.
- Langston.

1689
01:33:24,947 --> 01:33:27,732
I, I didn't know you were here.

1690
01:33:27,776 --> 01:33:29,734
- You think I'd miss this?

1691
01:33:29,778 --> 01:33:33,085
A long time ago, I was
just like these kids.

1692
01:33:33,129 --> 01:33:36,306
- Well thank you for
all of your help.

1693
01:33:36,349 --> 01:33:38,874
- Thank you.

1694
01:33:38,917 --> 01:33:41,616
You've been a real inspiration.

1695
01:33:42,834 --> 01:33:45,620
You've inspired
me to do better.

1696
01:33:46,751 --> 01:33:48,013
To be better.

1697
01:33:50,059 --> 01:33:54,193
[people chattering]
[soft synth music]

01:34:06,466 --> 01:34:09,818
[floorboards creaking]

1699
01:34:12,734 --> 01:34:13,735
- You go.

1700
01:34:17,086 --> 01:34:19,044
- What's wrong?

1701
01:34:19,088 --> 01:34:20,567
- It's past 12. [laughs]

1702
01:34:20,611 --> 01:34:22,657
You gonna sleep all day?

1703
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:24,267
- Michael wants to see you.

1704
01:34:24,310 --> 01:34:25,529
- Oh.

1705
01:34:25,572 --> 01:34:27,270
Okay.

1706
01:34:27,313 --> 01:34:28,706
Go ahead, I'll be out.

1707
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:29,751
I'm coming.

1708
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:36,714
Ooh. [sighs]

1709
01:34:46,985 --> 01:34:48,639
- Listen.

1710
01:34:48,683 --> 01:34:49,771
I know you and
the kids put a lot

1711
01:34:49,814 --> 01:34:52,034
of effort into the showcase,

1712
01:34:52,077 --> 01:34:55,385
but sometimes God
has other plans,

1713
01:34:55,428 --> 01:34:57,213
and wants to denounce
our affiliation with

1714
01:34:57,256 --> 01:34:59,824
the organization.

1715
01:34:59,868 --> 01:35:04,220
- You know what, no.
No, we won't give up.

1716
01:35:04,263 --> 01:35:06,875
- Do you know a man by
the name of Langston?

1717
01:35:06,918 --> 01:35:08,050
- Yes.

1718
01:35:08,093 --> 01:35:09,878
- Well, he called this morning,

1719
01:35:09,921 --> 01:35:13,708
and he wants to award
us a large grant.

1720
01:35:13,751 --> 01:35:16,580
This grant is gonna
last the entire lifespan

1721
01:35:16,623 --> 01:35:20,236
of the university
and the Devlin House.

1722
01:35:20,279 --> 01:35:22,368
[Kimberly chuckles]
