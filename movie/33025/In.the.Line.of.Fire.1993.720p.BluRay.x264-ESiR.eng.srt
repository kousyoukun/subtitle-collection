2
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,548
Oh, my God.

3
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:32,253
Oh, Frank, thank God.

4
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:33,758
I'm dead.

5
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:40,924
Frank, I'm sorry. I got lost.
This town is so confusing.

6
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,298
There's Connecticut,
Vermont, Massachusetts...

7
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,764
Man, what a day.

8
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:53,374
My wife had to work early,
so I took my kid to his new school.

9
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,038
He won't stop crying.

10
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,412
Says he wants
to move back to Chicago.

11
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:01,148
It broke my heart.

12
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:02,950
Any more excuses?

13
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:06,226
No

14
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,659
Good.

15
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,752
When you work with me,
you be punctual.

16
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:11,262
You got it?

17
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,190
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

18
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,741
- Come on.
- Frank, how you doing?

19
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,978
- Marty.
- Good to see you again.

20
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,154
Sorry we were late.

21
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:39,817
Al, could you go downstairs
and help out Jimmy and Raul?

22
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,656
- Please?
- Yeah, sure.

23
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,423
- Appreciate it.
- This is his.

24
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,999
Hi, you guys.

25
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:52,528
- You don't trust me.
- I live in a crappy neighborhood.

26
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,539
Yeah?

27
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,905
- Got that funny money?
- Yeah.

28
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,511
Right here.

29
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:04,906
Looks good.
Looks real good.

30
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,013
- We're in business.
- Excellent.

31
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:13,187
There's just one problem.

32
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:17,855
This guy Al keeps asking me questions
about my counterfeiter.

33
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:21,128
- Really?
- He asked too many questions.

34
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,965
My instinct usually tells me
when there's something wrong.

35
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:27,529
There's something wrong here,
so I had him followed.

36
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,239
He's a fucking Secret Service agent.

37
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,026
What do you think I ought to do?

38
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,964
Make sure the body
doesn't wash up on shore.

39
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,170
I want you to pop him for me.

40
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,404
I think maybe you're with him.

41
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:08,003
You came to me, remember?

42
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:11,377
So pop him.
Show me I'm an asshole.

43
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,316
I'm just a businessman.

44
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,355
So pop him...

45
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,549
and let's do some business.

46
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,275
Yes, that's what
I'm looking for.

47
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:44,678
Let's go get an omelet.
You like omelets?

48
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,982
I know a good place.
We'll have chili and cheese.

49
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,989
Let me get my pistoli.

50
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,924
My gun.

51
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:00,965
You're under arrest.

52
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,844
You're under arrest too.

53
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,345
Secret Service.

54
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:20,082
You knew the gun was empty, right?

55
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,178
You knew from the weight
of the gun...

56
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:25,156
that the chamber was empty?

57
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:28,660
- There could have been one bullet.
- Oh, my God.

58
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,160
Hi,Frank.

59
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,999
Do you think we can go someplace
and talk about this?

60
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,949
You killed guys before?

61
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:57,751
- Does it get to you?
- It gets to you.

62
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:04,656
I don't know if I'm cut out
for this undercover stuff.

63
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,130
I was so scared.

64
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,694
You know, I joined
the Secret Service because...

65
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,035
I always wanted
to protect people.

66
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,877
The idea of throwing yourself
in front of a gun...

67
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,883
hoping the bullet hits you instead
of the guy you're protecting...

68
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,441
You find that appealing?

69
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,181
I don't know.

70
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:32,884
Maybe I'm...

71
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,695
Maybe I'm just wrong
for the job.

72
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,766
You're a good man.
You'll make a good agent.

73
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:46,069
How do you know? This is
the longest conversation we ever had.

74
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,632
I know things about people.

75
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,907
Come on.
Let's get something to eat.

76
00:06:55,982 --> 00:07:00,578
I want to go home,
hug my wife and kid.

77
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:03,747
A lot of guys warned me
you were a pain in the ass.

78
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:06,223
And they were right.

79
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:10,388
- I'll see you in the office.
- Damn. The office.

80
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:14,432
Monroe wanted us
to check out some wacko.

81
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,627
- I'll take care of it.
- I'll go with you.

82
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,438
You go home,
hug your wife and kid.

83
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,571
I am not nosy lady.

84
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:32,778
I don't snoop,
but smoke alarm was going off.

85
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,786
I get scared.

86
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,517
I get more scared when I see
what is there inside.

87
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:50,230
Smoke was from crumbs
in oven left on.

88
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,925
Thirty-one years
I'm in this country.

89
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,435
I love United States.

90
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,300
I go to White House.

91
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:29,899
Only United States
can just anybody go...

92
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:33,571
to the house
of the president to visit.

93
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:36,308
So when I see this...

94
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,873
these killing things...

95
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:40,851
I call police.

96
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,889
They say they call Secret Service.

97
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:46,356
But two days,
you don't come.

98
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,961
The president gets approximately
1,400 threats a year, ma'am.

99
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,967
We have to check them all.

100
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,639
You say this fellow's name
is McCauley?

101
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,840
No, Joseph McCrawley
from Denver, Colorado.

102
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,782
I still remember like yesterday.

103
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,824
I cry and cry.

104
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,297
Joseph McCrawley of Denver,
right?

105
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,835
That's right.

106
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,005
Died over 30 years ago, age 11.

107
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,474
Your guy must have got himself
a duplicate birth certificate...

108
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,636
then used it
to get a driver's license.

109
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,844
- Thanks, Jack.
- See you.

110
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:23,779
Federal agents.
Open up.

111
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,327
Ma'am.

112
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,576
Oh, my God.

113
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,245
That's you.

114
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,010
Yeah.

115
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,917
Frank Horrigan?

116
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,386
Yeah.

117
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,581
The Secret Service agent?

118
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,717
Yeah, what did I win?

119
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,762
My God, it's really you?

120
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,855
Who the hell is this?

121
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:50,663
That was you
in my apartment last night.

122
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,043
McCrawley?

123
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,045
Why not call me Booth?

124
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,780
Why not Oswald?

125
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,114
Because Booth had flair,
panache...

126
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:10,246
the leap to the stage
after he shot Lincoln.

127
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,591
- Where are you?
- Closer than you might imagine.

128
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:21,121
It's very exciting to talk to you.
I feel like I know you.

129
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,758
How's that?

130
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,802
I've read about you,
seen photos.

131
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,964
You were JFK's favorite agent,
the best and the brightest.

132
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,100
But that was a long time ago.

133
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,371
What's kept you in the game
all these years?

134
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:35,811
Why don't we get together for a drink?
We could talk about that.

135
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:39,112
I'd love to, but the less
you know about me the better.

136
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:42,985
- Why?
- I'm planning to kill the president.

137
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:46,116
You shouldn't have said that.

138
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,285
It's a federal offense
to threaten the president.

139
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,295
You could go to jail
even if you don't mean it.

140
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,831
I mean it, all right.

141
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,459
John F. Kennedy said
all someone needs is a willingness...

142
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,628
to trade his life
for the president's.

143
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:02,470
- Right?
- That's right.

144
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,008
I'm willing.

145
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,469
Going up against you...

146
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:10,106
raises the game
to a much higher level.

147
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,851
Fate has brought us together.

148
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,482
I just can't
get over the irony.

149
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,161
What irony?

150
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,992
You being intimately involved...

151
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:28,329
with the assassinations
of two presidents.

152
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:37,170
Hang on a second.
I got something on the stove.

153
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,908
He was only in the building
for three weeks.

154
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,705
He came and left at odd hours.

155
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:16,714
What's really weird is that the other
tenants noticed him on the stairs...

156
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,215
but never really saw him.

157
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:22,220
Depending on who you talk to
he was between 5'8"and 6'2"...

158
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:26,349
between 165 and 180 pounds.

159
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:30,054
- Age?
- Between 28 and 45.

160
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:42,899
Two months before an election,
you get panic on a good day.

161
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:47,944
- They've been waiting for you.
- Sam.

162
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,573
Been a long time
since you've been over here.

163
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:53,083
I hear the new director
isn't much fun.

164
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:56,417
- I've been the director for two years.
- Yeah.

165
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,419
- Al D'Andrea.
- Director.

166
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,118
- You know Matt Wilder?
- Yeah.

167
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:04,253
He still owes me 20 bucks
from Super Bowl XXI.

168
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,093
He always liked Denver.

169
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,599
This is Agent-in-Charge
Bill Watts.

170
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,965
- And Lilly Raines.
- Hello.

171
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,471
Secretaries get prettier
and prettier around here.

172
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:16,064
And the field agents
get older and older.

173
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,935
Lilly's an agent.

174
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,878
I knew that. I just wanted to see
if she had a sense of humor.

175
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:27,110
Have a seat.
Let's talk about this guy.

176
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:32,791
- I guess we're calling him Booth?
- Yeah.

177
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:37,818
- What do you know about him?
- Well, he's dangerous.

178
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:41,457
- How do you know?
- I know things about people.

179
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,332
Why didn't you take
appropriate steps...

180
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,235
to know more that first night?

181
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,570
We had a busy day, Bill.

182
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,336
Too busy to investigate properly?

183
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,174
Your report says you were only
in the room ten minutes.

184
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:55,679
I didn't have a warrant.

185
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,283
Given your reputation
for undercover work...

186
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,343
- What reputation are you talking about?
- Let's get back on track.

187
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:05,720
- What's he referring to?
- Let's drop it.

188
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,453
Am I being paranoid
or is he busting my balls?

189
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,087
Probably a little of both.

190
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:17,592
Bill, there was a time around here
when I was almost as arrogant as you.

191
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,364
I don't have time for this.

192
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,670
I have to pull 75 agents
out of Miami.

193
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,545
Keep me posted, Sam.

194
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:37,551
- What do we do with this guy?
- We'll keep investigating.

195
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,147
Meanwhile,
you could have my phone tapped.

196
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,557
- What makes you think he'll call again?
- He'll call again.

197
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,391
He's got panache.

198
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,661
- "Panache"?
- It means flamboyance.

199
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,897
- I know what it means.
- Really?

200
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,134
- I had to look it up.
- We'll tap your phone.

201
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,199
By the way, Frank...

202
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:02,077
Watts is nowhere near as arrogant
as you were when you had Kennedy's ear.

203
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:12,019
Just what reputation
was Watts referring to?

204
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:15,116
You know damn well.

205
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,560
Is it because I'm considered
a borderline burnout...

206
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:20,120
with questionable social skills?

207
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,902
What do you want to talk to me about,
besides your reputation?

208
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,997
I want to be assigned
to the president.

209
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,338
- Protection?
- That's right.

210
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:37,940
After all these years?
Christ, you're a dinosaur.

211
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:39,984
This guy's gonna make a try,
and I've gotta be there.

212
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:43,010
- Watts would fight me tooth and nail.
- Then fight him back.

213
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,455
You owe it to me
after 30 years of favors.

214
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,516
If you knew how many times
I protected your job...

215
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,028
I've got to come back.

216
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:59,966
You really want to stand post again,
at your age?

217
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,468
Yeah.

218
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:07,808
I've got at least one pair
of good shoes in the closet somewhere.

219
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:09,873
All posts, we're stopping.
Traveler wants to work the ropes.

220
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:13,469
The French president's going with him.
Get a security man up here.


221
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,680
run

221
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,097
He's coming over here, look!

222
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,295
Goddamn it.

223
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,600
- Mr. President!
- Get back.

224
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,060
- What's going on here?
- Horrigan had a heart attack.

225
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:14,169
- Pal, you okay?
- Take it easy.

226
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:18,471
Get the hell out of here.
What the hell's going on?

227
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:21,444
I got a call
there was a cardiac case.

228
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:24,209
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm on my break here.

229
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,775
I get it.

230
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,787
You bastards.

231
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,789
Who's the wise guy?

232
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,459
Everybody back to work.

233
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:44,961
All right, who was the joker
who called those guys?

234
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:48,803
It may not have been a joke.
You were looking peaked out there.

235
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:52,970
I find out who it is,
I'll pay him back in spades.

236
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,479
How can you be sure
it was a "him"?

237
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:04,886
You missed my street, Al.

238
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:08,119
Why don't you have a car?

239
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:12,391
I lived in New York a lot of years.
I like public transportation.

240
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:15,126
You like buses.
That's great.

241
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,861
Why make me go out of my way
every night?

242
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,732
I like your company.

243
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:25,301
He's a weird-looking guy,
isn't he?

244
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,810
Yeah, if he still
looks like that.

245
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:32,843
Pull up over here.

246
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,112
- It's a weird subculture, Al.
- Yeah.

247
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:44,383
I'd like you to send some field agents
to check these things...

248
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:45,922
ask about some wackos.

249
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,425
Sure. First thing in the morning,
I'll get on it.

250
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:51,758
- I'll talk to Jack about it.
- Hang on. I got the other line.

251
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,896
Yeah.

252
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:07,543
- How are you doing?
- I'm fine, thanks.

253
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,445
Hang on a second.
Let me get rid of the other call.

254
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:13,947
- You got it?
- We got it.

255
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:16,112
Keep him on the line
till we get the ANI.

256
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:21,959
- Yeah.
- Trying to trace me?

257
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:24,689
Why didn't I think of that?

258
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:29,097
You did or you're not
the adversary I'd hoped for.

259
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:32,398
Speaking of which, how are you?
I was worried about you today.

260
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,035
- Why?
- In the motorcade...

261
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,268
I thought you were
gonna pass out.

262
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:43,647
You should get in shape
for that kind of duty.

263
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:45,649
Yeah, maybe you're right.

264
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:50,484
By the way,
I'm watching your movie.

265
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:52,648
Movie?

266
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:57,889
November, 1963. Kennedy's last days,
the arrival in Texas.

267
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:02,128
It must have been
exciting for you.

268
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:07,195
Dallas,
that morning at Love Field.

269
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,669
You all look so radiant.'

270
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:15,008
JFK, Jackie and you.

271
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:17,310
You look so young and able.

272
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,678
What did happen to you that day?

273
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:24,847
Only one agent reacted
to the gunfire...

274
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:27,915
and you were closer
to Kennedy than he was.

275
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:31,485
You must have looked up at the window
of the Texas Book Depository...

276
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:33,962
but you didn't react.

277
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:37,025
Late at night,
when the demons come...

278
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:41,997
do you see the rifle
coming out of that window...

279
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:44,633
or do you see Kennedy's head
being blown apart?

280
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:48,875
If you'd reacted
to that first shot...

281
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:52,508
could you have gotten there
in time to stop the big bullet?

282
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:57,714
If you had, that could have been
your head being blown apart.

283
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:03,550
Do you wish you'd succeeded
or is life too precious?

284
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,762
What's done is done.

285
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:12,201
I have that "Esquire" magazine article
on the tenth anniversary...

286
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:16,036
about you and all the other agents
that were there that day.

287
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:21,875
So sad how your wife left you
and took your little daughter.

288
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:26,043
You were so forthright
about your drinking problem...

289
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:29,314
and the fact that
you weren't easy to live with.

290
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:33,517
I was so moved by your honesty.

291
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,219
The world can be
a cruel place...

292
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:38,922
to an honest man.

293
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:43,024
What about you, Booth?
What's your story?

294
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,935
It's an epic saga.

295
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,770
I'll talk to you again soon.

296
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:52,366
Nice to have a friend.

297
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:02,544
- Did you get him?
- We got him.

298
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:10,961
Go!

299
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:16,091
Get on the floor!

300
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:21,464
Get your hands
where I can see them!

301
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:26,439
He could have a device
that manipulates the ANI...

302
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,979
and fakes the line's identification.

303
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,107
Makes it seem like
he's calling from another number.

304
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:33,650
Where would he get this device?

305
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:36,312
He could build one if he were
knowledgeable in digital circuitry.

306
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:39,118
- But you can't trace the call.
- You can run a parity check.

307
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,351
If his line is wired
for digital switches.

308
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:42,893
You can trace the call?

309
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:46,522
Not if it's an old,
twisted-pair, analog line.

310
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,623
Damn it, Jack,
give a straight answer...

311
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:51,133
or my partner
will shoot off his foot.

312
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:54,228
He calls again,
you keep him on the line.

313
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:58,139
We'll see what we can do.
Right, Tony?

314
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:03,010
You might suggest to the police that
they don't knock down any more doors.

315
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,375
I'm intrigued,
but why play it for me?

316
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:37,609
We'd like you to consider canceling
the president's dinner tomorrow.

317
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,718
The state dinner,
at the French embassy?

318
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:45,586
Do you know how long it took to line up
this trip this close to the election?

319
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,182
This guy's manipulated
the phone system.

320
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,784
If he has a knowledge of explosives,
there could be problems.

321
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:52,921
Do your job,
there won't be any problems.

322
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:55,522
It's not that hard to smuggle weapons
inside an embassy.

323
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,003
You think the French want to knock off
the president? Are you nuts?

324
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:02,905
- They love him.
- Why does every chief of staff...

325
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:05,534
You have no reason to believe
this guy is any more dangerous...

326
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,044
than thousands of others
who make idle threats...

327
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:11,605
but you want me to alter the itinerary
of the world's most powerful man...

328
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,651
and risk offending
40 million French.

329
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:17,210
Isn't it possible this guy
has pushed some buttons in you?

330
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:20,052
Maybe you're overreacting a little.

331
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,593
I'm just trying
to protect your boss, damn it.

332
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,391
So am I. We're trailing 12 points
in the latest polls.

333
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:29,297
He could be out of a job
in six weeks.

334
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:32,336
- He's got to be seen.
- Even if it kills him?

335
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,337
Next order of business?

336
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:40,238
How could being a dozen points down
look like good news?

337
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:42,939
The president
was even worse off weeks ago.

338
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:45,949
His aides will keep him out
with the voters as much as they can...

339
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:47,416
especially in the midwest.

340
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:50,010
Then an all-important swing
through California.

341
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:54,324
Ladies and gentlemen...

342
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:57,122
the President and the First Lady
of the United States...

343
00:29:57,195 --> 00:30:00,756
and His Excellency,
the President of France, and his wife.

344
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:46,969
- Agent Raines, you look devastating.
- Thank you.

345
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:50,606
Good enough to eat, I might add,
if you'll pardon the expression.

346
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,645
Every time I start
to sympathize with you...

347
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,086
you say something
that really annoys me.

348
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:00,021
Why sympathize?

349
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:04,554
The tape of that phone call,
when he mentioned your wife.

350
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,256
Ex-wife.

351
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:08,998
At any rate, I'm sorry.

352
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:12,503
It's strange that the only sympathy
I get these days...

353
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,630
is from a would-be assassin
or a woman I tend to annoy.

354
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,265
Would you care to dance?

355
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:19,999
Perhaps some other time.

356
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:22,012
I get off in a couple hours.

357
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,777
What are you looking at?

358
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:30,119
I was wondering
where you hide your firearm.

359
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:34,123
Don't tell me.
Let me guess.

360
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,295
We're on final approach
to Los Angeles.

361
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:48,829
The temperature is a balmy 76 degrees.
It's a beautiful day out there.

362
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,706
Thanks for flying with us.
We look forward to seeing you again.

363
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:13,392
I'd like to deposit this
in the new account.

364
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,727
I'll need to see
your corporate resolutions.

365
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:25,401
Microspan Corporation.

366
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:28,570
- What kind of business are you in?
- Software.

367
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:30,944
- Up in San Jose.
- Yes.

368
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:34,951
Based there, but I'm opening
an office here in Los Angeles.

369
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:37,249
I like San Jose.

370
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:39,916
- Are you from there?
- No.

371
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:42,618
- Where are you from?
- Minneapolis.

372
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:45,492
You're kidding.
So am I.

373
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:49,766
Wow, it's a small world.

374
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:53,202
I hated the winters.

375
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,762
Nine months of the year
I'd stay indoors and pig out.

376
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,434
I moved here and have lost
30 pounds so far.

377
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:02,912
- What high school did you go to?
- New Brighton High School.

378
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:06,407
There isn't any
New Brighton High School.

379
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,511
There was when I was there.

380
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,784
Maybe I'm just confused.

381
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:15,849
It happens a lot.

382
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:19,124
What was the name of that high school
on Third just across from...

383
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:22,633
I'm sorry, but I'm very late
for a meeting. Will this take long?

384
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,828
Not at all.
Just another minute.

385
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,663
Thank you.

386
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:37,510
You have a very pleasant way
about you.

387
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,351
Thank you, Mr. Carney.

388
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:57,898
Agent Raines, how would you like
to give a colleague a ride home?

389
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,994
Why do you keep flirting with me?

390
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:02,368
Am I flirting with you?

391
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,000
You know it can't possibly go anywhere,
so why keep doing it?

392
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:08,044
Maybe it's because I know
it can't possibly go anywhere.

393
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:10,137
Give me a lift.
I'll buy you an ice cream.

394
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,647
No further obligations.

395
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:15,017
Oh, boy.

396
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:18,782
I've never worked
with a female agent before.

397
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:22,815
- How many are there?
- About 125.

398
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:27,397
- Pure window dressing.
- Excuse me?

399
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,726
Window dressing.

400
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:34,238
About 125
out of a little over 2,000.

401
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:36,569
They have you all around
so the president can look good...

402
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,302
to his feminist voters.

403
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:42,974
Do you make an effort
to be obnoxious or is it a gift?

404
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:44,845
It's a gift.

405
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:48,044
Half the things we do
are window dressing.

406
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:50,245
Take running alongside
that limousine.

407
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:53,347
It'd take an antitank missile
to put a dent in that damn thing.

408
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,914
There we are out for show...

409
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:57,927
trying to make the president
look more presidential.

410
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:02,098
If I'm here to court
the feminist vote...

411
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,532
what demographics
do you represent?

412
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,002
Let's see.

413
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,905
White, piano-playing heterosexuals
over the age of 50.

414
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:15,071
There ain't a whole lot of us,
but we do have a powerful lobby.

415
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:22,717
Well, time flies
when you're being annoyed.

416
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,347
- Where are you going?
- I have a date.

417
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:28,950
- With whom?
- That's none of your business.

418
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:32,462
You want a ride?

419
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,293
I don't think so.

420
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:37,300
I like it here this time of day.
I'll hang out.

421
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:43,473
Thanks for the ice cream.
See you.

422
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:44,974
You're welcome.

423
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:58,785
If she looks back,
that means she's interested.

424
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:02,223
Come on now,
give me a little look.

425
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,488
One little glance back.

426
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:07,827
Give me that smug look
and be on your way.

427
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,174
Well, Abe...

428
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:23,243
Damn, I wish I could have
been there for you, pal.

429
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:33,683
Hi, baby.
How are you doing?

430
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:36,852
Come on up here. Give me a kiss.
That's a good boy.

431
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:39,021
Yes, I missed you too.

432
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:45,698
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.

433
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:50,264
- I got your address from the phone book.
- But I'm not listed.

434
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:56,211
Uh-oh.
I suppose I better come clean.

435
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,248
I followed you.

436
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,784
I'm sorry.
I'm not very good at this.

437
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:03,046
I'm new in town.

438
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,614
I was wondering if you would care
to join me for dinner tonight.

439
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:11,728
That's very sweet, but l...

440
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:15,232
And I also wanted to apologize
for lying to you this afternoon.

441
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:17,164
We both know
I'm not from Minneapolis.

442
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,730
I shouldn't ask so many questions.

443
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:23,399
Did you mention
our conversation...

444
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:27,308
to anyone at the bank
this afternoon?

445
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,573
May I?

446
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,250
Rory, settle down!

447
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,418
Pam, what's going on?
Hi.

448
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:42,987
This is my roommate.
Sally, this is Mr. Carney.

449
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:44,824
Call me Jim.
How do you do?

450
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:48,661
Nice to meet you.
I was just on my way out.

451
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:52,601
I'm afraid I can't let you ladies
leave this evening.

452
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,763
What?

453
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,069
You shouldn't have been
from Minneapolis.

454
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:00,943
Look, I don't know
what you want, but...

455
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:24,099
- Hi, this is Sally.
- And this is Pam.

456
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:26,636
We're either out having fun
or we're asleep.

457
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:29,468
So leave your name and number
and we'll call you back.

458
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,973
Bye.

459
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:43,479
Frank, I hope you don't mind me
calling you at the office.

460
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:45,647
I was in the neighborhood.

461
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,520
No, why don't you drop by?

462
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:49,286
I'd love to.

463
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:54,330
Let me take some time to welcome
those who are joining us late.

464
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:56,628
I'd love to drop by.
I'd like it a lot.

465
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:58,828
We've got so much in common.

466
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:02,031
We do? Like what?

467
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:05,132
We're both willing to trade
our lives for the president.

468
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:07,541
We're both honest
and capable men...

469
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:10,045
who were betrayed
by people we trusted.

470
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:13,845
- I wasn't betrayed, Booth.
- Sure you were.

471
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:16,512
The Warren Commission's report
on the assassination...

472
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:19,420
They called your procedure
"seriously deficient."

473
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,856
They criticized you
and the other agents...

474
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:24,520
who were out drinking late
the night before...

475
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:28,156
as though Kennedy would be alive today
if you'd been in bed at 10.'00 p.m.

476
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:29,859
That's ludicrous.

477
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,698
Maybe they were right.

478
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:37,536
As a matter of fact,
they weren't right.

479
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:41,704
You wanted to station agents
on his bumpers and sideboards.

480
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:44,543
He refused. Do you know why
I think he refused?

481
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:48,551
I think he refused
because he had a death wish.

482
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,917
He talked all the time
about being assassinated.

483
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:53,718
His favorite poem was
"I Have a Rendezvous with Death"...

484
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:57,352
which is not a good poem.

485
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:59,395
I think he wanted to die.

486
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:03,024
I think he didn't care that his death
would ruin your life.

487
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,568
I think he was a selfish bastard.

488
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:10,138
But what do you think?

489
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:18,639
What about you?
Who betrayed you?

490
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:20,149
I don't think he's scrambling it.

491
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:23,050
Some of the same people.

492
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:28,023
But I'm gonna get even.
I'll have my day in the sun.

493
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:31,427
The question is.'
Will you have yours?

494
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:35,932
- It's coming.
- You're in for a lot more pain.

495
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,230
How much of this shit
do I have to listen to?

496
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:39,599
Jesus!

497
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:44,201
He's right across the street:
Lafayette Park. Keep him on.

498
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:04,460
Are you guys crazy?

499
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:21,243
Do you see somebody over there?

500
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:27,179
I told you to get in shape.

501
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:39,992
This is your current address?

502
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:43,989
And you didn't see anybody suspicious
hanging around that phone booth?

503
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:53,842
That's him.

503
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:57,680
AI,That's him. 
504
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:33,178
Secret Service.
I'm impounding this car.

505
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:39,018
He put his hand down here.
We got fingerprints.

506
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:42,683
You all right?

507
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:34,307
- Tony.
- Yeah?

508
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:36,243
Have a look at this.

509
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:39,248
- This the print from Secret Service?
- Yeah.

510
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:41,216
Something strange here.

511
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:45,016
Shit. It's a C-12.
We can't tell them.

512
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:54,797
- I'm afraid that we've drawn a blank.
- You sure?

513
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:57,800
We ran that print
against everything we've got.

514
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,602
What do we do now?

515
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,803
I'm leaving with the president
in the morning.

516
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:11,973
- You keep investigating.
- What should I do?

517
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:15,383
You're an adult human being.
Think of something.

518
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:18,444
You're a real pain in the ass
when things don't go your way.

519
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:20,114
Your friends warned you about that.

520
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:39,175
The president
hit the campaign trail today.

521
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:41,234
He left
from Andrews Air Force Base...

522
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:45,179
on a whirlwind tour of 12 states
over the next six days.

523
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,581
With just over a month to go
before the election...

524
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,654
the president is trailing
his opponent by ten points.

525
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:54,155
To close that gap, he'll concentrate
his campaign efforts in the midwest...

526
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:56,021
where he's sagging in the polls.

527
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:59,461
The campaign swing will wind up
in Chicago with a big rally.

528
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:03,159
The president's campaign staff
is hopeful that by that time...

529
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:05,167
Reservations, Donna Lynn.
May I help you?

530
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:08,170
I'm calling to find out when
you would have a flight on Tuesday...

531
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:11,173
from Washington to Los Angeles?

532
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:12,708
All right.

533
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:15,176
If possible, I'd like to get
an open-ended ticket...

534
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:19,204
because I may have to make some stops
in the midwest on my return.

535
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:21,183
Denver Command Post, C-5 Agents.

536
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:23,879
We'll off-load the choppers first.
Who's our route agent?

537
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:27,284
C-5 Agent,
that will be Jack McKeen.

538
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:31,794
Denver Command Post, Watts.
We have arrival.' 1315.

539
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:35,730
C-5 Agent, where are we keeping
these cars secured?

540
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:39,030
Denver Police Department
has a fenced area for us.

541
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:42,197
Security Room, Watts.
We're ten minutes out. Situation report.

542
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:46,538
Here in Denver, we gather today
in the shadow of giants,

543
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:50,376
brave pioneers who overcame
terrifying obstacles...

544
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:53,507
to carve a new nation
from a wilderness.

545
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:58,988
Today we are asked to match
our vision to their vision...

546
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:02,924
and to pass that legacy
of a boundless...

547
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:05,553
Horrigan to I D.
Sector three secured?

548
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:07,654
Sector three is secure.

549
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,995
A legacy of tolerance...

550
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:12,001
The president campaigning today
in Denver.

551
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:16,563
Here in Washington this afternoon,
the Senate again delayed action...

552
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:29,508
We are living in a time
of global economic transition.

553
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:34,819
We need compassion and vision
to create a future...

554
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:39,022
of peace and progress
for every American.

555
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:42,259
That was the president
stumping in Nebraska today.

556
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:45,096
He's due to arrive here in Los Angeles
later in the month...

557
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:48,935
to compete for California's crucial
54 electoral votes.

558
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:10,785
Hi, Sandy Riggs calling
for James Carney.

559
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:13,624
If you're serious
about trying to catch a rally...

560
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:16,461
while you're in the midwest,
you best call me.

561
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:19,798
The president's schedule changes
hour by hour.

562
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:21,632
In answer
to your other question...

563
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:24,299
just send a check here
to party headquarters.

564
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:27,207
Thanks again.
I'm looking forward to meeting you.

565
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:29,802
Ladies and gentlemen
of Holland, Michigan...

566
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:32,643
the President
of the United States!

567
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:39,147
We've gone a long way
toward achieving that goal...

568
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:41,157
but there's a lot left to do.

569
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:43,489
Watts, Flynn. We got some trouble
on the tracks up ahead.

570
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,653
You better notify
the White House staff.

571
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:50,166
Milwaukee will be easy tomorrow.
We've only got one site.

572
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,503
May I have your attention, please?

573
00:47:57,574 --> 00:48:01,840
Flight 318 to Milwaukee
is now boarding at Gate 21.

574
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:04,004
Please have
your boarding passes ready.

575
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:08,074
All passengers should proceed
to the boarding area now.

576
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:15,191
Checking.

577
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:19,195
Found any bombs today?

578
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:27,027
- Agent Raines.
- Agent Horrigan.

579
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:29,698
How's the first lady?
Did she ask about me?

580
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:31,536
Have you gotten to know them yet?

581
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:34,543
I prefer not to get to know
the people I'm protecting.

582
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:36,203
Why is that?

583
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,078
You might decide they're
not worth taking a bullet for.

584
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:41,276
Here comes my replacement.

585
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:44,718
- Care to join me in the bar?
- We can't drink on the road.

586
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:47,552
Of course not, but they've got
a hell of a piano player.

587
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:59,560
I've played for presidents,
and I've played with presidents.

588
00:48:59,636 --> 00:49:03,902
Nixon and I once did
a halfway decent duet of"Moonglow."

589
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:05,838
I heard he didn't like you.

590
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,912
That's not true.
We got on all right.

591
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:11,947
His chief of staff
was another matter.

592
00:49:12,015 --> 00:49:13,573
Once at a rally in Boston...

593
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:16,915
he ordered me to get rid
of some antiwar protesters.

594
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:21,684
I said I couldn't do that.
Freedom of speech, that kind of stuff.

595
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:25,421
He said, "When I'm talking to you,
I am the president."

596
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:30,262
And I said, "You look more like
a sack of shit in a cheap suit, sir."

597
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:33,867
I like the "sir."
It's a classy touch.

598
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,098
- I thought so.
- Mm-hmm.

599
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:51,377
So how come you never wear shades
standing post?

600
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:56,451
I like the wackos to see
the whites of my eyes.

601
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:58,994
A good glare can be
just as effective as a gun.

602
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:01,497
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah.

603
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:17,069
You got me.

604
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:20,344
You better stick
to the shades, sweetheart.

605
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:40,297
Agent Raines,
what are you afraid of?

606
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:44,006
Afraid of making a big mistake.

607
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:48,376
Good night.

608
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,394
We're looking at this route
to the hospital...

609
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:48,561
Oh, good.

610
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:51,106
We've got some updates
on Milwaukee tomorrow.

611
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:52,607
Thanks.

612
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,644
Call Advance and see
if we can get a backup route.

613
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:45,995
- Don't answer it.
- Shit.

614
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:55,834
Traveler's lost ground in Georgia,
so Milwaukee's off.

615
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:59,672
They're staging a rally outside Atlanta
in a town called Woodstock.

616
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:02,507
We need you down at Communications,
right away.

617
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:04,513
I'll be right down.

618
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:15,017
Traveler's losing ground in Georgia,
so Milwaukee's out tomorrow.

619
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:18,858
And they're staging a rally
somewhere outside Atlanta.

620
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:25,359
Damn.

621
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:26,868
Oh, dear.

622
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:32,166
What am I doing?

623
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:34,209
Shit. Ow.

624
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:37,879
Oh, boy.

625
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:44,549
Damn.

626
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:48,523
I gotta put all that shit back on,
goddamn it.

627
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:56,192
Please open your purses
for inspection.

628
00:53:56,299 --> 00:54:00,633
You don't know how glad I am to see you
all out in the rain with me today.

629
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:03,571
I've been going around saying...

630
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,734
"Don't just vote for me,
join me."

631
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,711
Today you certainly have.

632
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:12,805
We may feel a tad damp today...

633
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:17,046
but guess who's going to be all wet
on election day?

634
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:28,597
What about the watch list?

635
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:30,929
I've got 23 regional crazies
under surveillance.

636
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:33,060
Chicago intelligence has nine more.

637
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:34,763
- The hospital?
- St. Ann's.

638
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:37,602
Extra units of Traveler¡¯s
blood type on hand.

639
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:40,609
Accessible to that
alternative route as well.

640
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:42,941
ETA Chicago:ten minutes.

641
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:53,948
- Under the weather?
- Sick as a dog.

642
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:57,482
Yeah? What's this?

643
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,188
"Psychological Profile
of John Booth."

644
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:03,960
- Did you make a mistake?
- What?

645
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,492
You said you were afraid
of making a big mistake.

646
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:17,810
Let's be realistic. This job
is not like we work in a bank.

647
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:22,280
You had an affair with an agent,
and it came out badly.

648
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:24,319
He wasn't an agent.

649
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:28,050
He left you because you wouldn't quit.
You were brokenhearted.

650
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:33,084
I left him because I wouldn't
quit my job for him.

651
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,097
It did break my heart.

652
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:40,832
You vowed to never let a man
come between you and your career.

653
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:48,075
Except now you're in love with me,
and it scares you a little.

654
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:51,011
Blow your nose. Here.

655
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:52,514
Sorry.

656
00:55:56,486 --> 00:56:00,354
What were to happen
if I gave up my job for you?

657
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:08,496
Why would you do that?

658
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,999
Maybe I vowed
to never let my career...

659
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:13,592
come between me and a woman.

660
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:28,012
- Yeah?
- Be careful, will you?

661
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:32,180
This whole event tonight has been
advertised in advance. Just be alert.

662
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:48,727
This is Horrigan.
It's a zoo out here.

663
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:51,831
It's not very secure.
We've got to take Traveler underground.

664
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,899
All posts, this is Watts.

665
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:57,276
We're using the alternate
arrival site.'underground.

666
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:14,388
Horrigan to Watts.
I think Booth may be here.

667
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:16,931
I thought
you couldn't identify him.

668
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,934
I can't.
Just call it a hunch.

669
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:22,597
With all due respect to your psychic
abilities, we'll stick to the game plan.

670
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:24,606
All posts, take your positions.

671
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:29,608
- You've got a fever.
- Just stay alert in there.

672
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:40,753
There is one quality above all
that marks this president.

673
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:44,555
It has earned him the affection
of every working man and woman.

674
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:48,620
- Give us our president!
- That quality is courage!

675
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:53,258
The question to us is:

676
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:55,964
Will we stand by the man...

677
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:58,803
who has stood by us?

678
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:02,242
- Post check. Stage right?
- Stage right all clear.

679
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,008
- Stage left?
- Stage left clear.

680
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:09,814
- Stage center?
- Stage center clear.

681
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:14,289
- Mezzanine left?
- Mezzanine left all clear.

682
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:17,656
The President of the United States
and the First Lady.

683
00:58:56,733 --> 00:58:58,496
Gun!

684
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:00,228
Get down!

685
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:07,975
Get these people
out of here!

686
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:10,707
Hold all radio traffic.

687
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:17,414
Security room.
What the hell's going on in there?

688
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,817
I'm all clear.

689
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,382
False alarm.

690
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:28,123
Traveler's secure.
All posts resume positions.

691
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:29,960
- You all right, Mr. President?
- I'm all right.

692
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:35,896
Everything's all right, folks.
Everything will be just fine.

693
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:38,736
We had a little false alarm there.

694
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:42,869
Wasn't that exciting?

695
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:45,915
Take your seats, please,
ladies and gentlemen.

696
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:48,848
Security Room, Raines.

697
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,545
It was just a balloon popping.
All clear.

698
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:52,587
Traveler wants to continue.

699
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:19,112
Do you have any idea
how many votes you cost us last night?

700
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:22,515
The president came off looking
like a coward on national television.

701
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,246
He came off all right.

702
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,254
You were the one that
looked like the damn coward.

703
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:28,690
This is a joke to you?

704
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:31,124
No, you're a joke to me, Harry.

705
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:33,890
- You have no idea what we do here.
- That's enough!

706
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:37,592
You call me Harry again, you'll be
busting counterfeiters in Alaska.

707
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,998
You keep him away from the president,
away from the White House...

708
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:43,005
and you sure better
keep him away from me!

709
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:45,438
You don't talk
to the chief of staff like that!

710
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:50,002
- I don't work for him.
- No, you work for me. You did.

711
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:52,804
You're off my detail.

712
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:03,454
My Super Bowl debt.

713
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:05,494
In case I don't see you
after this trip.

714
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:19,470
You know, if you were just
to acknowledge...

715
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:21,635
that it was
an unfortunate situation...

716
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:23,803
I won't apologize
for doing my job.

717
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,144
I'm not saying you should...

718
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:28,683
but the president was humiliated.

719
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:30,309
He's alive, isn't he?

720
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:33,014
We're here to safeguard
his dignity as well.

721
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:34,580
I'm not paid for that.

722
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:38,252
What about the time Kennedy's girlfriend
was caught in the White House...

723
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:40,557
and you said she was with you?

724
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:45,559
Don't believe every rumor
someone tells you.

725
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:48,798
Wilder told me
the whole story...

726
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:51,635
about how you were
suspended a month without pay.

727
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:54,141
I'd say that was
safeguarding his dignity.

728
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,940
That was different.
He was different.

729
01:01:57,013 --> 01:01:58,776
Maybe you were different.

730
01:01:58,848 --> 01:02:00,281
I was different.

731
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:02,840
The whole damn country was different.

732
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:04,477
Everything would be different
right now too...

733
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,920
if I'd been half as paranoid
as I am today.

734
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:08,388
Fuck.

735
01:02:29,378 --> 01:02:32,609
Why not just retire, Frank?

736
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:34,240
Live off your pension.

737
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:36,046
I mean, what's the point?

738
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:41,223
Somebody else asked me that
not long ago.

739
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:45,892
Hell, you don't spend any money
on anything except jazz records.

740
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:48,226
I want to stay
on the Booth case.

741
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:53,935
All right.

742
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:57,370
- As for protective detail, I can't...
- I understand.

743
01:03:03,846 --> 01:03:08,806
That thing in Chicago...
I just don't understand.

744
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:11,547
I've never been on the wrong side
of a judgment call like that.

745
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:14,055
You had the flu,
for Christ's sake.

746
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:16,557
It's been known
to impair judgment.

747
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:19,794
Face it.

748
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:21,489
You're too old for this shit.

749
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:22,351
- Hello.
- What happened in the Windy City?

750
01:04:26,662 --> 01:04:28,994
The balloon get you
in a little panic?

751
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:34,596
- You were there?
- Yes, I was.

752
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:38,834
Watching the president,
I couldn't help wondering...

753
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:42,570
why a man like you would risk his life
to save a man like that.

754
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:45,805
You have such a strange job.

755
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:48,975
I can't decide
if it's heroic or absurd.

756
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:53,955
Why would a man like you
risk his life to kill a man like that?

757
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:57,288
Don't you have a psychological profile
on me yet?

758
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,294
I don't put a lot of stock in them.

759
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:00,852
Nor do I.

760
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:04,364
A man's actions don't equal the sum
of his psychological parts.

761
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:07,300
- Doesn't work that way.
- Just how does it work?

762
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:14,707
It doesn't work.

763
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:18,406
God doesn't punish the wicked
and reward the righteous.

764
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:20,244
Everyone dies.

765
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:22,682
Some die
because they deserve to.

766
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:26,085
Others die simply because
they come from Minneapolis.

767
01:05:26,155 --> 01:05:28,487
It's random,
and it's meaningless.

768
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:33,622
If none of this means anything,
then why kill the president?

769
01:05:34,797 --> 01:05:36,856
To punctuate the dreariness.

770
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:40,959
It sounds to me like you need
to get yourself laid.

771
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:44,234
You're the same as me.

772
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:47,071
Name one thing in your life
that has any meaning.

773
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:51,780
- I play the piano.
- That's not enough.

774
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:53,280
How do you know?
Do you play?

775
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:56,250
I've seen you
in your bar alone.

776
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:01,849
There's no cause left
worth fighting for.

777
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:04,552
All we have is the game.

778
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:06,060
I'm on offense.

779
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:07,755
You're on defense.

780
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:09,855
When do we start playing the game?

781
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:12,867
The clock's ticking.

782
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,368
Take care.

783
01:06:14,437 --> 01:06:16,462
Wait.

784
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:24,939
He scrambled it again.
I missed him.

785
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:26,447
Fuck!

786
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:32,920
Fucker.

787
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:58,646
Jesus, Frank.

788
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:03,717
I've been calling for hours.
I thought something happened to you.

789
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:05,344
Are you okay?

790
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:07,651
No, I'm not okay.

791
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:13,518
I'm sick, I'm tired, and I'm armed.
So be careful.

792
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:19,364
- You're also a genius.
- Not to be recognized in this lifetime.

793
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:22,700
- You listen to the tapes of the call?
- Yeah. Remember you said...

794
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:27,334
Call the Minneapolis field office.
Ask about accidental deaths...

795
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:29,901
anything we might pin to Booth.

796
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:32,277
- Will you listen to me, please?
- Spit it out.

797
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:35,806
You said to have field agents
check into model builders.

798
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:38,479
There's a professor
at the Art Center College of Design...

799
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:41,717
in Pasadena, California.

800
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:43,349
I think we got something.

801
01:07:43,426 --> 01:07:48,386
Like I told your colleague, I met him
at a design conference in New Orleans.

802
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:50,398
We ordered some drinks
at a hotel bar.

803
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:52,627
He seemed like
a nice enough guy.

804
01:07:52,701 --> 01:07:54,464
This is good.

805
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:58,633
But when the talk turned to politics,
he took on a real nasty edge.

806
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:01,039
He said he felt betrayed
by the government...

807
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:05,239
and he wanted to exact
some measure of revenge.

808
01:08:05,314 --> 01:08:08,249
The way he said it
scared the shit out of me.

809
01:08:08,317 --> 01:08:11,548
So I said, "Okay, nice talking
to you. Good luck."

810
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:13,918
And I got the hell out of there.

811
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:17,049
But I cannot remember his name.

812
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:21,763
But I'm pretty sure
he said he was from Phoenix.

813
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:27,759
You guys ought to talk to a guy
in Phoenix named Walter Wickland.

814
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:29,498
He knows everybody down there.

815
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:31,597
Book us on the first flight
to Phoenix.

816
01:08:31,674 --> 01:08:34,438
How about we get a police artist
together with the professor here...

817
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:37,274
have a composite sketch
faxed to us?

818
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:40,611
You figure that one out
all by yourself?

819
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:42,913
Kiss my ass.

820
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:45,317
I told you
you'd make a good agent.

821
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:53,193
It doesn't look much like him,
but that's got to be Mitch Leary.

822
01:08:53,262 --> 01:08:56,789
I haven't seen him
in over a year.

823
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:58,356
What do you know about the guy?

824
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:02,095
Do you see this wheelchair?

825
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:06,140
Mitch bought it for me.
It cost over a thousand dollars.

826
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:10,437
- See this?
- Whoa, take it easy.

827
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:15,111
This is in case
he ever comes back.

828
01:09:15,217 --> 01:09:18,846
He accused me of ripping off
one of his model designs.

829
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:22,721
Said my penalty
for disloyalty was death.

830
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:25,988
You put him away, let me know.
I'll sleep better.

831
01:09:26,028 --> 01:09:28,588
You got any idea
where we can find him?

832
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:32,395
Yeah, I think I might have
his address around here somewhere.

833
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:44,972
Don't move.

834
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:57,643
Drop it!

835
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:13,199
- Let him go, Horrigan.
- I got him.

836
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:15,361
It's okay.

837
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:19,066
We're on the same team.

838
01:11:19,141 --> 01:11:22,508
- Hands, motherfucker!
- I'm getting my identification!

839
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,141
Give it to me.

840
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:28,775
David Coppinger, CIA.

841
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:32,019
Who's this asshole?

842
01:11:32,054 --> 01:11:34,181
- He's with me.
- Shit.

843
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,759
Goddamn it.

844
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:39,384
Are you here for Leary or me?

845
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:42,453
Mr. Leary used to be
one of our operatives.

846
01:11:45,934 --> 01:11:47,765
He's threatened
to kill the president.

847
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:51,272
We didn't think he was serious
till you found that fingerprint.

848
01:11:51,373 --> 01:11:53,068
But you and the FBI knew.

849
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:56,373
- I understand your frustration.
- You understand my frustration?

850
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:58,743
You pompous son of a bitch!

851
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:00,509
What the fuck
did Leary do for you anyway?

852
01:12:00,582 --> 01:12:03,813
Run coke for the Contras?
Sell arms to Iran?

853
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:07,652
It's a C-12 matter,
so this is off the record.

854
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:10,724
If asked, I'll deny it.

855
01:12:13,962 --> 01:12:16,260
Leary is what we nowadays
call a wet boy.

856
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:18,991
What's a wet boy?

857
01:12:20,035 --> 01:12:22,435
- Leary's an assassin.
- Jesus.

858
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:25,302
In Leary's case,
that's putting it too gently.

859
01:12:26,608 --> 01:12:28,269
He's more like a predator.

860
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:49,391
- Was that you shooting?
- Yes.

861
01:12:49,465 --> 01:12:51,456
What kind of gun is that?

862
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:53,160
Something I made.

863
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:54,862
No kidding?

864
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:57,496
You made it?

865
01:12:57,573 --> 01:12:59,404
Guess it beats paying for it.

866
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:02,239
Can I see it?

867
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:03,972
Yeah.

868
01:13:04,012 --> 01:13:06,139
- Shit, it's light.
- Yeah?

869
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:09,184
- What's it made of?
- It's composite, like plastic.

870
01:13:09,251 --> 01:13:11,151
It's pretty neat.

871
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,552
You mind if I give her
a little dance?

872
01:13:13,622 --> 01:13:15,112
Not at all.

873
01:13:16,091 --> 01:13:17,558
Go for it.

874
01:13:26,502 --> 01:13:29,767
That is really great!

875
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:36,375
Would you be
interested in selling it?

876
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,438
No, I need it.

877
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:40,948
For what?

878
01:13:43,152 --> 01:13:45,586
To assassinate the president.

879
01:13:52,795 --> 01:13:56,856
- Why would you want to do that?
- Why did you kill that bird, asshole?

880
01:14:05,507 --> 01:14:08,169
Mitch Leary was one of our
most effective contractors...

881
01:14:08,243 --> 01:14:11,974
but political climates changed,
and cutbacks were made.

882
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:15,541
Leary didn't take it too well.
He couldn't adjust to civilian life.

883
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:17,778
We've been looking for him
for some time.

884
01:14:17,853 --> 01:14:19,787
Maybe you folks in the FBI
will have more luck.

885
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:22,517
- lf we can work together, it's possible.
- Wouldn't that be refreshing?

886
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:26,995
We have his fingerprints
and numerous photographs.

887
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:29,122
What makes you think
he looks like any of these?

888
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:31,029
They're at least 15 years old.

889
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:33,567
A man in his line
stays out of the camera's eye.

890
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:37,230
They're worthless.
He'll be in disguise anyway.

891
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:39,934
- We need photo alterations.
- Yeah.

892
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:43,876
Gentlemen,
what I'm about to show you...

893
01:14:43,946 --> 01:14:45,504
is highly classified.

894
01:14:47,382 --> 01:14:49,316
This man is a former colleague
of Leary's.

895
01:14:49,384 --> 01:14:51,648
A close friend...

896
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,655
who went by his home in Phoenix
to try to persuade him...

897
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:57,123
to accept counseling
and retraining.

898
01:14:57,192 --> 01:14:59,285
This is how Leary
treats his friends.

899
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:07,835
We need every possible variable:

900
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:10,997
facial hair,
skin colorization...

901
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:13,041
glasses, weight changes.

902
01:15:13,108 --> 01:15:15,576
Keep in mind,
he's 15 years older now.

903
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:41,998
As good as they are,
they aren't much good.

904
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:43,470
The eyes are dead.

905
01:15:43,572 --> 01:15:46,473
Always tell a man
by his eyes.

906
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:51,846
- Look, tomorrow morning, I'd like...
- I'm resigning tomorrow.

907
01:15:51,914 --> 01:15:53,211
What?

908
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:59,019
Why? Just because
you were scared in Phoenix?

909
01:15:59,087 --> 01:16:01,214
Hell, I was scared too.
You did your job.

910
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:04,725
I have nightmares...

911
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:07,421
about that boat,
with the plastic bag over my head.

912
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:10,329
I can't breathe.

913
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:13,266
Phoenix just clinched it.

914
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:16,634
- The Service has counseling for this.
- I've been to the counselors.

915
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:21,701
Look, I need you.
We can get this guy.

916
01:16:21,777 --> 01:16:24,245
I can't do it!

917
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:27,805
Stop this cockamamie shit now,
will you?

918
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:29,282
Come on, pal, I need you.

919
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:33,414
Please.

920
01:16:49,671 --> 01:16:54,506
Cockamamie. That's a word your
generation hasn't embraced yet.

921
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,009
Maybe you ought to use it
once in a while...

922
01:16:56,078 --> 01:16:59,070
just to keep it alive.

923
01:16:59,147 --> 01:17:01,081
- Cockamamie.
- Yeah.

924
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:05,547
- Oh, God.
- It made you laugh, for Christ's sake.

925
01:17:05,654 --> 01:17:08,248
You kill me.

926
01:17:08,323 --> 01:17:11,349
Frank, he's on the line!

927
01:17:11,426 --> 01:17:12,893
I got it.

928
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:17,022
- Hello?
- Hello, Frank.

929
01:17:17,065 --> 01:17:20,501
Let me take a second to give
a hearty welcome to all of you...

930
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:22,969
joining our program in progress.

931
01:17:23,005 --> 01:17:26,168
I know who you are, Leary.

932
01:17:30,846 --> 01:17:33,838
I'm glad, Frank.

933
01:17:33,915 --> 01:17:36,247
Friends should be able
to call each other by name.

934
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:37,808
We're not friends.

935
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:40,184
Sure we are.

936
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:42,189
I've seen what you do to friends.

937
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,059
What's that supposed to mean?

938
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:48,426
You slit your friend's throat.

939
01:17:58,407 --> 01:18:00,568
You talked to Coppinger?

940
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:03,406
Yeah, that's right.

941
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:05,503
Did you delouse?

942
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:07,411
The man's a professional liar.

943
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:09,313
I saw the photos.

944
01:18:09,384 --> 01:18:12,478
No, you saw what
he wanted you to see.

945
01:18:12,554 --> 01:18:14,613
I saw a picture
of your friend...

946
01:18:14,723 --> 01:18:16,122
lying on the floor
with his throat cut.

947
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:19,285
But you didn't see
what you couldn't possibly know.

948
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:23,024
They sent my best friend,
my comrade in arms...

949
01:18:23,098 --> 01:18:26,659
to my home to kill me!

950
01:18:26,768 --> 01:18:28,258
Your voice is shaking.

951
01:18:28,336 --> 01:18:30,930
I never lied to you,
and I never will!

952
01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:32,940
Why is it everyone
who ever knew you...

953
01:18:33,008 --> 01:18:35,476
said that you're
a sick son of a bitch?

954
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:37,535
Your colleagues, your wife.

955
01:18:37,612 --> 01:18:39,477
What does your wife say
about you?

956
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,106
We're not talking about me.

957
01:18:41,183 --> 01:18:45,677
- I want you of all people to understand.
- Why should I understand?

958
01:18:45,787 --> 01:18:49,780
We both used to think this country
was a very special place!

959
01:18:49,858 --> 01:18:52,986
- You don't know what I used to think.
- But you know about me?

960
01:18:53,028 --> 01:18:56,862
Do you have any idea what I've done
for God and country?

961
01:18:56,932 --> 01:18:59,662
Some pretty fucking horrible things!

962
01:18:59,768 --> 01:19:02,168
I don't even remember
who I was...

963
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:04,797
before they sunk their claws
into me.

964
01:19:04,873 --> 01:19:08,900
- They made you into a real monster.
- And now they want to destroy me...

965
01:19:08,977 --> 01:19:12,572
because we can't have monsters
roaming the quiet countryside.

966
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:19,682
What do you see when you're
in the dark and the demons come?

967
01:19:24,025 --> 01:19:25,652
I see you.

968
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:28,990
I see you standing
over the grave...

969
01:19:29,064 --> 01:19:31,123
of another dead president.

970
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:33,360
That's not going to happen.
I'm on to you.

971
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:36,666
Fuck you. I am willing
to trade my life for his.

972
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:40,037
I am smart and willing,
and that is all it takes.

973
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:42,804
That president is coming home
from California...

974
01:19:42,878 --> 01:19:44,573
in a fucking box.

975
01:19:44,646 --> 01:19:46,841
Where in California?

976
01:19:46,915 --> 01:19:49,577
You want the address?

977
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:51,118
Come on.

978
01:19:51,186 --> 01:19:54,019
I'll keep you in the game,
but I'm not going to throw it for you.

979
01:19:54,055 --> 01:19:55,750
Give yourself up.

980
01:19:55,857 --> 01:19:58,052
So I can live a long
and fruitful life?

981
01:19:58,126 --> 01:19:59,559
We can work something out.

982
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:01,721
Fuck you.

983
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:03,354
Don't fucking lie to me.

984
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:05,558
I have a rendezvous with death.

985
01:20:05,634 --> 01:20:08,467
And so does the president.

986
01:20:08,537 --> 01:20:10,767
So do you,
if you get too close to me.

987
01:20:10,872 --> 01:20:13,705
You have a rendezvous
with my ass, motherfucker!

988
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:18,041
Do you know how easily
I could kill you?

989
01:20:18,113 --> 01:20:21,981
Do you know how many times I've watched
you go in and out of that apartment?

990
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:25,009
You're alive because
I have allowed you to live.

991
01:20:25,086 --> 01:20:26,576
So you show me...

992
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:28,623
some goddamn respect!

993
01:20:40,202 --> 01:20:42,762
St. Francis Hotel,
Florida Avenue in northeast.

994
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:50,577
Let's go! Move it!

995
01:23:56,297 --> 01:23:57,730
Take my hand.

996
01:24:00,135 --> 01:24:02,296
Take it.
You don't, you'll die.

997
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:28,427
You're going to shoot me,
after I saved your life?

998
01:24:33,268 --> 01:24:35,099
Shit!

999
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:38,731
The only way to save the president
is to shoot me.

1000
01:24:39,941 --> 01:24:43,843
Are you willing
to trade your life for his?

1001
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:45,812
Or is life too precious?

1002
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:04,998
Don't fucking move!

1003
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:10,599
Frank, I got him.

1004
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:55,248
Nothing here.

1005
01:26:46,634 --> 01:26:48,693
Frank, you got a phone call.

1006
01:27:00,415 --> 01:27:03,851
- Yeah.
- You looked so sad on the bus.

1007
01:27:03,918 --> 01:27:06,682
I'm sorry.
It was self-defense.

1008
01:27:13,094 --> 01:27:14,561
Tell me about Skellum.

1009
01:27:14,629 --> 01:27:16,620
You're barking
up the wrong tree.

1010
01:27:16,698 --> 01:27:18,563
Skellum's worthless.

1011
01:27:18,633 --> 01:27:20,066
Meeting him in Los Angeles?

1012
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:24,568
It's late in the game,
and you're way behind.

1013
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:26,504
I'm way ahead.

1014
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:28,940
I know what you look like.
I've seen your eyes.

1015
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:30,637
My eyes might look different next time.

1016
01:27:30,712 --> 01:27:32,202
What's behind them won't.

1017
01:27:32,313 --> 01:27:34,474
You better pray
I don't find you, prick.

1018
01:27:34,549 --> 01:27:37,882
"Pray"?
Do you want to kill me?

1019
01:27:37,952 --> 01:27:39,385
That's right.

1020
01:27:41,055 --> 01:27:43,114
The irony is so thick
you could choke on it.

1021
01:27:43,191 --> 01:27:45,159
There's no fucking irony,
Mitch!

1022
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,955
Think.

1023
01:27:46,995 --> 01:27:51,193
The same government that trained me
to kill, trained you to protect.

1024
01:27:51,299 --> 01:27:55,463
Yet now you want to kill me,
while, up on that roof, I protected you.

1025
01:27:55,536 --> 01:27:57,367
They'll write books about us.

1026
01:27:57,438 --> 01:27:59,429
I'm tired of your bullshit!

1027
01:27:59,507 --> 01:28:00,940
Don't be a poor sport.

1028
01:28:03,678 --> 01:28:07,580
You could have taken me out,
but you chose to save your ass.

1029
01:28:07,649 --> 01:28:09,583
Don't cry about it now.

1030
01:28:12,186 --> 01:28:14,746
It does make me wonder
about Dallas though.

1031
01:28:14,822 --> 01:28:18,349
Did you really do
all you could have...

1032
01:28:18,426 --> 01:28:20,360
or did you
make a choice there too?

1033
01:28:23,898 --> 01:28:26,366
Do you really have the guts
to take a bullet?

1034
01:28:27,935 --> 01:28:30,870
I'll be thinking about that
when I'm pissing on your grave.

1035
01:28:37,178 --> 01:28:39,874
There's no one named Skellum
in all of Los Angeles?

1036
01:28:39,947 --> 01:28:42,745
- Ran five different counties.
- What about Louisiana?

1037
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:44,944
Jack was checking that.
Hang on.

1038
01:28:48,556 --> 01:28:51,923
No Skellums. Sorry.

1039
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:53,426
Shit.

1040
01:28:53,494 --> 01:28:54,927
Damn it!

1041
01:29:03,104 --> 01:29:06,039
The election's in three weeks. You're
asking me to commit political suicide.

1042
01:29:06,107 --> 01:29:07,972
I'm asking you
to stay out of California.

1043
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:12,036
If this guy's so smart, he won't
tell you where he'll make an attempt.

1044
01:29:12,113 --> 01:29:13,740
He wouldn't lie to me.

1045
01:29:13,815 --> 01:29:17,182
Isn't that sweet?
Have you become that close?

1046
01:29:18,486 --> 01:29:22,855
California is the key
to the whole damn race.

1047
01:29:22,924 --> 01:29:25,484
We've narrowed the gap to five points.
We can't let up now.

1048
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:29,052
We'll change our procedures.
Move him around in unmarked cars.

1049
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:31,690
Frisk everyone withing 50 yards.

1050
01:29:31,766 --> 01:29:35,896
Frisk people going
into $10,000-a-plate dinners?

1051
01:29:37,105 --> 01:29:38,834
You're overreacting again.

1052
01:29:38,906 --> 01:29:41,272
If I don't overreact,
the president's dead.

1053
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:44,072
Why is he here?
I said keep him away.

1054
01:29:44,145 --> 01:29:45,806
Frank's heading
this investigation.

1055
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:47,677
Then let him investigate.

1056
01:29:47,749 --> 01:29:50,479
As long as he doesn't come
within sight of the president.

1057
01:29:50,551 --> 01:29:54,009
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm in the middle of a campaign here.

1058
01:30:04,732 --> 01:30:06,131
Hi.

1059
01:30:08,136 --> 01:30:10,127
Up late?

1060
01:30:10,204 --> 01:30:11,694
Lead advance for Los Angeles.

1061
01:30:11,773 --> 01:30:13,866
It's a lot of work.

1062
01:30:13,941 --> 01:30:16,739
- What's up?
- I've got a request.

1063
01:30:20,014 --> 01:30:22,983
I'd like you to talk to Watts.

1064
01:30:23,017 --> 01:30:24,541
Get me on your advance team.

1065
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:32,715
- He thinks you'll overreact.
- What do you think?

1066
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:36,492
I think maybe
you're too close to all this.

1067
01:30:36,564 --> 01:30:39,590
That's why I've got to be there.

1068
01:30:39,667 --> 01:30:42,397
I can spot him.
I can anticipate him.

1069
01:30:42,503 --> 01:30:44,994
- You think he'll be in California?
- Yes.

1070
01:30:45,072 --> 01:30:49,304
- Why would he tip his hand like that?
- To keep the game close.

1071
01:30:49,377 --> 01:30:51,140
He'll be there.

1072
01:30:54,382 --> 01:30:57,681
This has nothing to do with you and me.
Strictly professional.

1073
01:30:59,754 --> 01:31:04,418
But that son of a bitch
killed my partner, my friend.

1074
01:31:04,525 --> 01:31:05,958
I know.

1075
01:31:07,395 --> 01:31:08,862
I'm sorry.

1076
01:31:13,234 --> 01:31:16,226
You're looking
at a living legend:

1077
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:19,137
the only active agent
who ever lost a president.

1078
01:31:22,844 --> 01:31:24,175
Please?

1079
01:31:29,116 --> 01:31:32,415
Passengers arriving on flight 1026
from Washington, Dulles...

1080
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:33,953
may claim their baggage...

1081
01:31:39,894 --> 01:31:41,987
Mr. Horrigan,
welcome to Los Angeles.

1082
01:31:44,365 --> 01:31:46,265
Here in Washington
analysts ask.'

1083
01:31:46,334 --> 01:31:49,565
Can the president close
the remaining distance in time?

1084
01:31:49,637 --> 01:31:51,696
The answer lies
in California...

1085
01:31:51,772 --> 01:31:53,467
where the president
will appear at a rally...

1086
01:31:53,574 --> 01:31:55,667
at the Bonaventure Hotel
in Los Angeles.

1087
01:32:05,019 --> 01:32:06,611
Field office, Chavez.

1088
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:09,417
The advance team is at the Bonaventure.
I'll stick with them.

1089
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:10,957
Will advise.

1090
01:32:58,673 --> 01:33:01,073
- Any problems?
- No, secured up.

1091
01:33:06,447 --> 01:33:08,142
Security Room, TSD.

1092
01:33:08,215 --> 01:33:10,012
We swept the western end
of the motorcade route.

1093
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:12,348
Manholes are secured,
mailboxes removed...

1094
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:14,684
abandoned vehicles towed,
bridges checked out.

1095
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:16,746
We're moving to sector three.

1096
01:33:21,829 --> 01:33:24,821
We'll need sharpshooters
on both those towers there.

1097
01:33:26,734 --> 01:33:29,726
We'll place
three sharpshooters there...

1098
01:33:29,804 --> 01:33:32,204
which covers
those restricted blocks.

1099
01:33:32,273 --> 01:33:35,970
Other polls today
had the president still gaining...

1100
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:39,309
but analysts say
if he's going to close the margin...

1101
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:41,075
it will have to be
on that California trail.

1102
01:33:50,424 --> 01:33:53,188
Welcome to Los Angeles
International Airport.

1103
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:57,458
Baggage claim and ground transportation
are on the lower level.

1104
01:34:30,865 --> 01:34:32,799
Radio operators
will set up over here.

1105
01:34:46,614 --> 01:34:49,640
Presidential Suite.
Yeah, who's this?

1106
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:52,446
TSD is up here
sweeping the room right now.

1107
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:38,198
That's it.
Work hard.

1108
01:35:51,212 --> 01:35:54,477
Raines, this is Horrigan.
Double-checking those exits?

1109
01:35:54,548 --> 01:35:57,779
Yes. This is the third time now.

1110
01:36:07,228 --> 01:36:10,789
Watch list: Paul Rubiak,
yellow, section five.

1111
01:36:16,971 --> 01:36:19,303
- Secret Service.
- Get the fuck...

1112
01:36:27,348 --> 01:36:28,975
Robert Stermer.

1113
01:36:31,485 --> 01:36:33,009
He's a bellboy.
He's been cleared.

1114
01:36:33,053 --> 01:36:34,680
- Yeah, he's clean.
- All right.

1115
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:39,089
Have a nice day.

1116
01:36:41,495 --> 01:36:44,396
Show's over, folks.
Let's pack it up.

1117
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:47,263
Let's go.
Pack it up and move.

1118
01:36:48,536 --> 01:36:50,231
Mr. Carney?
All set.

1119
01:36:51,605 --> 01:36:53,368
Finally we meet.

1120
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,271
You are James Carney?

1121
01:36:55,342 --> 01:36:57,173
You must be Sandy Riggs.

1122
01:36:57,244 --> 01:36:59,178
I was starting to wonder
if you really existed...

1123
01:36:59,246 --> 01:37:02,113
or maybe you were an angel
sent down to help the party.

1124
01:37:02,183 --> 01:37:03,616
I'm very much human.

1125
01:37:03,684 --> 01:37:05,117
Let's have a drink.

1126
01:37:05,186 --> 01:37:07,313
They got a bar up
at the top of this place.

1127
01:37:07,388 --> 01:37:09,686
It's beautiful!
What a view!

1128
01:37:09,757 --> 01:37:12,021
When does the president arrive?

1129
01:37:12,059 --> 01:37:14,857
Tomorrow evening,
just in time for dinner.

1130
01:37:14,929 --> 01:37:17,523
Here's your invitation.
Don't lose that.

1131
01:37:17,598 --> 01:37:20,863
The Secret Service
has been driving me bonkers.

1132
01:37:20,935 --> 01:37:22,562
I got you a great seat.

1133
01:37:22,636 --> 01:37:25,298
It's just a stone's throw away
from the president himself.

1134
01:37:27,007 --> 01:37:31,273
So, tell me, James,
what is Microspan Corporation all about?

1135
01:37:31,345 --> 01:37:33,370
I just came
to meet the president.

1136
01:37:33,447 --> 01:37:36,177
I wouldn't presume
to bore you with my business.

1137
01:37:36,250 --> 01:37:40,311
I don't blame you. One thing
I don't understand is high-tech.

1138
01:37:40,387 --> 01:37:42,184
I can't wait
to introduce you to him.

1139
01:37:42,256 --> 01:37:44,486
Would you look
at this beautiful view?

1140
01:37:46,293 --> 01:37:48,227
Yes, it is very pretty.

1141
01:37:50,764 --> 01:37:52,254
Did you get the list
of the dinner guests?

1142
01:37:52,333 --> 01:37:54,062
Who is the fat cat organizer?

1143
01:37:54,134 --> 01:37:55,965
Yes, Sanford Riggs...

1144
01:37:56,003 --> 01:37:58,062
the Chairman
of the California Victory Fund.

1145
01:38:00,507 --> 01:38:03,408
Call Keziah over at LAPD...

1146
01:38:03,477 --> 01:38:05,502
and make sure they have
no police uniforms missing.

1147
01:38:05,579 --> 01:38:07,137
It's been taken care of.

1148
01:38:07,214 --> 01:38:10,650
Call the hospital to see if
they have that supply of B-positive.

1149
01:38:12,553 --> 01:38:15,044
Your average American businessman...

1150
01:38:15,122 --> 01:38:17,955
Iooks at a product,
a marketing scheme, what have you...

1151
01:38:17,992 --> 01:38:20,654
and he sees the length
and width of it.

1152
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:23,822
The Japanese see the depth,
the long-term effect.

1153
01:38:23,931 --> 01:38:26,126
We look at the next fiscal quarter.

1154
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:29,363
The Japanese look
at the next quarter of a century.

1155
01:38:29,436 --> 01:38:31,961
Try to get our people
to understand that, John, huh?

1156
01:38:32,006 --> 01:38:35,169
Mr. Riggs,
can I talk to you for a moment?

1157
01:38:35,242 --> 01:38:36,675
Excuse me, fellows.

1158
01:38:38,012 --> 01:38:40,947
- Who's that?
- Secret Service agent.

1159
01:38:42,616 --> 01:38:44,550
Do you know everyone who's
attending this dinner personally?

1160
01:38:44,618 --> 01:38:46,051
I sure do.

1161
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:48,645
How about these pictures here?
Any of them look familiar?

1162
01:38:48,722 --> 01:38:51,384
I went through all this
with another agent yesterday.

1163
01:38:51,458 --> 01:38:52,982
I'll cooperate...

1164
01:38:53,027 --> 01:38:55,018
but this is bordering
on harassment.

1165
01:38:55,095 --> 01:38:58,292
Yeah,
I'm a harassing kind of guy.

1166
01:39:03,304 --> 01:39:06,034
I'll be right back,
Mr. Carney.

1167
01:39:06,106 --> 01:39:09,234
- He did what any of us would have.
- He beat up a bellboy on television.

1168
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:11,744
- I was there.
- I'd say he's overwrought.

1169
01:39:11,812 --> 01:39:15,077
We're all a little overwrought
knowing Leary's out there someplace.

1170
01:39:15,149 --> 01:39:18,414
- You don't think he's a liability?
- No, I don't.

1171
01:39:18,485 --> 01:39:20,749
You're in the minority. I want him
gone before Traveler arrives.

1172
01:39:20,821 --> 01:39:23,255
- That's not fair.
- Send him to San Diego in the morning.

1173
01:39:23,324 --> 01:39:26,088
By whose order?
Harry Sargent's?

1174
01:39:28,829 --> 01:39:30,421
You want to tell him or should I?

1175
01:39:30,497 --> 01:39:33,898
Somebody's approaching
Traveler's suite.

1176
01:39:34,001 --> 01:39:35,400
Lilly, you there?

1177
01:40:11,905 --> 01:40:13,497
Hi.

1178
01:40:16,076 --> 01:40:18,977
What are you doing up here?

1179
01:40:19,079 --> 01:40:22,515
I was just seeing if there was
anything more I could do.

1180
01:40:25,252 --> 01:40:27,516
You know, between
the Los Angeles Police Department...

1181
01:40:27,588 --> 01:40:30,989
the FBI and the rest of us...

1182
01:40:31,091 --> 01:40:35,357
there are 229 people
protecting Traveler tomorrow.

1183
01:40:37,431 --> 01:40:38,989
A lot of guns.

1184
01:40:40,934 --> 01:40:44,495
Leary gets off a shot, you and I
could be killed in the cross fire.

1185
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:55,214
Bill Watts just called.

1186
01:40:56,283 --> 01:40:58,012
Heard about the bellman?

1187
01:40:58,118 --> 01:40:59,551
So did Traveler.

1188
01:41:01,288 --> 01:41:05,384
They want you to go to San Diego and
assist in the advance there tomorrow.

1189
01:41:07,294 --> 01:41:09,228
Just like that.

1190
01:41:11,298 --> 01:41:14,392
It's not just you against Leary.

1191
01:41:15,836 --> 01:41:18,430
You gotta have some faith
in the rest of us.

1192
01:41:22,309 --> 01:41:23,901
You know something?

1193
01:41:27,815 --> 01:41:31,581
For years I've been listening
to all these idiots on bar stools...

1194
01:41:31,652 --> 01:41:35,418
with all their pet theories
on Dallas.

1195
01:41:37,157 --> 01:41:40,422
How it was the Cubans
or the CIA...

1196
01:41:40,494 --> 01:41:43,429
or the white supremacists
or the mob...

1197
01:41:43,497 --> 01:41:49,265
or whether it was one weapon
or whether it was five.

1198
01:41:51,338 --> 01:41:53,704
None of that's meant
too much to me.

1199
01:41:55,576 --> 01:41:59,273
But Leary...

1200
01:41:59,346 --> 01:42:03,339
He questioned whether I had the guts
to take that fatal bullet.

1201
01:42:07,354 --> 01:42:09,288
God, that was a beautiful day.

1202
01:42:13,393 --> 01:42:15,384
The sun was out.

1203
01:42:17,531 --> 01:42:20,967
Had been raining all morning.
The air was...

1204
01:42:24,872 --> 01:42:29,468
The first shot sounded
like a firecracker.

1205
01:42:29,543 --> 01:42:32,944
I looked over and saw him.
I could tell he was hit.

1206
01:42:37,217 --> 01:42:41,517
I don't know why I didn't react.
I should have reacted.

1207
01:42:42,723 --> 01:42:45,317
I should have been running flat-out.

1208
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:48,694
I just couldn't believe it.

1209
01:42:53,734 --> 01:42:58,330
If only I reacted,
I could have taken that shot.

1210
01:43:03,977 --> 01:43:06,343
That would have been
all right with me.

1211
01:43:56,096 --> 01:43:57,723
What's the number
of that San Diego office?

1212
01:43:57,798 --> 01:44:00,494
619-Ukulele.

1213
01:44:00,567 --> 01:44:03,058
- "Ukulele"?
- That's how I remember it.

1214
01:44:03,136 --> 01:44:08,096
Seven numbers, seven letters.
You just push u-k-e-l-e-l-e. Easy.

1215
01:44:10,143 --> 01:44:13,442
Wait a minute.
Isn't ukulele spelled u-k-u?

1216
01:44:14,982 --> 01:44:19,419
I don't know.
But the phone number's u-k-e-l-e-l-e.

1217
01:44:34,835 --> 01:44:36,234
Wait a second.

1218
01:44:36,336 --> 01:44:37,928
Attention, all passengers.

1219
01:44:38,005 --> 01:44:41,907
Flight 158 to San Diego
is now boarding at Gate 7.

1220
01:44:54,988 --> 01:44:56,455
Jesus.

1221
01:44:56,523 --> 01:45:00,459
We have an arrival. Chopper standing by
to take Traveler to site one.

1222
01:45:15,542 --> 01:45:17,976
Southwest Savings.
May I help you?

1223
01:45:18,011 --> 01:45:21,947
- Southwest?
- Yes. May I help you?

1224
01:45:22,015 --> 01:45:25,280
- Hello?
- What's your address?

1225
01:45:30,724 --> 01:45:32,487
Taxi!

1226
01:45:35,829 --> 01:45:38,297
Raines to lobby agents,
post check.

1227
01:45:38,398 --> 01:45:41,128
- Post three?
- Roger. In place.

1228
01:45:41,201 --> 01:45:43,863
- Post six?
- Roger. In place.

1229
01:45:43,937 --> 01:45:46,997
- Post 12?
- Roger. In place.

1230
01:45:53,213 --> 01:45:54,680
Wait right here.

1231
01:45:57,551 --> 01:46:01,453
I'm sorry there's no Mitchell Leary
or Joseph McCrawley in our accounts.

1232
01:46:01,521 --> 01:46:04,115
Try to imagine him
in disguise: a hat...

1233
01:46:04,191 --> 01:46:07,627
wigs, mustache,
that sort of thing.

1234
01:46:07,694 --> 01:46:10,322
I haven't seen him, but I've only
been here a couple weeks.

1235
01:46:10,430 --> 01:46:13,524
Who was in charge
of new accounts before you?

1236
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:14,999
Pam Magnus.

1237
01:46:16,069 --> 01:46:18,765
Where can I find her?

1238
01:46:20,207 --> 01:46:22,266
She's dead.

1239
01:46:22,376 --> 01:46:24,708
She was murdered.

1240
01:46:57,077 --> 01:46:59,375
She was murdered,
and she was from Minneapolis.

1241
01:46:59,479 --> 01:47:02,107
They won't cancel.
You know what Sargent said.

1242
01:47:02,182 --> 01:47:05,049
At least make the arrival underground.
Don't give Leary a target.

1243
01:47:05,118 --> 01:47:08,019
They want a big show.
They said unless we have proof...

1244
01:47:08,088 --> 01:47:10,716
The proof may just be
a dead president.

1245
01:47:17,063 --> 01:47:20,226
I'm pulling up all the accounts
opened during Pam's last six months.

1246
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:24,236
We don't log them by the date entered.
It's going to take time to compile.

1247
01:47:24,304 --> 01:47:27,205
Fax me the list as soon
as you get them, please.

1248
01:47:30,010 --> 01:47:32,604
All agents in position.

1249
01:48:38,144 --> 01:48:40,476
Please step back, sir.

1250
01:48:41,581 --> 01:48:43,481
Please empty your pockets.

1251
01:48:45,385 --> 01:48:46,852
Thank you.

1252
01:49:40,874 --> 01:49:42,273
You're from Texas, right?

1253
01:49:51,117 --> 01:49:54,917
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

1254
01:50:02,996 --> 01:50:04,429
It's fantastic.

1255
01:50:08,168 --> 01:50:09,760
I'm sorry?

1256
01:51:24,544 --> 01:51:28,036
Frank, what are you doing here?
Watts will shit if he sees you.

1257
01:51:28,114 --> 01:51:31,015
- You get a fax for me?
- Yeah, just now.

1258
01:51:31,051 --> 01:51:33,849
What is it?
What's this about?

1259
01:51:37,157 --> 01:51:39,648
What the hell is going on?

1260
01:52:16,730 --> 01:52:18,994
Jesus.

1261
01:52:39,119 --> 01:52:42,555
- What the hell is he doing here?
- I don't know.

1262
01:52:44,124 --> 01:52:47,218
- Who gave you permission...
- He's here. His name is Jim Carney.

1263
01:52:47,293 --> 01:52:50,228
- You're not on this post.
- I want the damn seating chart!

1264
01:52:50,296 --> 01:52:51,957
Give him the chart.

1265
01:53:22,061 --> 01:53:24,029
Gun!

1266
01:53:38,344 --> 01:53:40,539
Put the gun down!

1267
01:53:43,183 --> 01:53:45,014
Move!

1268
01:53:55,895 --> 01:53:57,863
Don't shoot!
Out of the way!

1269
01:54:04,170 --> 01:54:05,762
Get down!

1270
01:54:10,376 --> 01:54:12,037
Lock him up!

1271
01:54:12,111 --> 01:54:14,204
Don't shoot!

1272
01:54:14,280 --> 01:54:16,510
Get him in! Come on!

1273
01:54:16,583 --> 01:54:18,016
- Inside!
- Move it!

1274
01:54:23,790 --> 01:54:25,348
Raines to shooters.
Hold your fire.

1275
01:54:32,732 --> 01:54:32,899
Get out of his way!

1276
01:54:32,899 --> 01:54:34,332
Get out of his way!

1277
01:54:35,535 --> 01:54:37,730
He has a hostage!

1278
01:54:44,711 --> 01:54:47,407
Raines to shooters.
If you have a shot, take it!

1279
01:55:03,096 --> 01:55:04,563
Nice view.

1280
01:55:05,965 --> 01:55:09,025
- What's the plan, Captain?
- It's your man up there.

1281
01:55:09,102 --> 01:55:10,865
You tell me.

1282
01:55:12,138 --> 01:55:14,368
All posts, hold radio traffic.

1283
01:55:14,440 --> 01:55:18,103
Get me sharpshooters
on the north and west towers.

1284
01:55:18,177 --> 01:55:19,667
Take the subject out.

1285
01:55:36,996 --> 01:55:40,762
So you had the guts.
You took the bullet.

1286
01:55:41,935 --> 01:55:43,459
I broke my damn ribs.

1287
01:55:43,536 --> 01:55:45,504
Sorry.
I wasn't aiming at you.

1288
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:48,771
Where are the shooters?

1289
01:55:52,478 --> 01:55:54,571
West tower in place.
No lights inside.

1290
01:55:54,647 --> 01:55:56,444
Shit. No shot from the north.

1291
01:55:56,516 --> 01:56:01,249
- We can't see inside.
- A bulletproof vest is cheating a bit.

1292
01:56:01,321 --> 01:56:03,414
Otherwise, you played a good game.

1293
01:56:03,489 --> 01:56:08,256
It's no game, Leary.
I was doing my job.

1294
01:56:09,495 --> 01:56:11,053
What are we gonna do now?

1295
01:56:11,130 --> 01:56:13,360
Do you believe
in the nobility of suicide?

1296
01:56:16,502 --> 01:56:20,097
But if you want to blow your head off,
be my guest.

1297
01:56:20,173 --> 01:56:24,576
Nicely put, except I don't want
to leave this miserable world alone.

1298
01:56:27,180 --> 01:56:29,774
- West tower, do you have a shot?
- Negative.

1299
01:56:29,849 --> 01:56:32,249
Too dark.
Target unclear.

1300
01:56:33,553 --> 01:56:36,078
It's better to die
with a friend.

1301
01:56:36,155 --> 01:56:38,282
You're not a friend.

1302
01:56:38,358 --> 01:56:40,417
You're a damn killer,
you sick bastard.

1303
01:56:40,493 --> 01:56:44,361
Don't talk to me like that.
I saved your life. You owe me.

1304
01:56:44,430 --> 01:56:49,493
- I don't owe you shit.
- I was always honest and fair with you.

1305
01:56:49,569 --> 01:56:52,800
- Go ahead and shoot.
- It's Frank.

1306
01:56:52,872 --> 01:56:55,067
Quiet!

1307
01:56:55,141 --> 01:56:56,836
Come on, damn it.

1308
01:56:56,909 --> 01:56:59,810
- Frank, are you talking to me?
- What are you waiting for?

1309
01:56:59,879 --> 01:57:01,972
What am I waiting for?

1310
01:57:02,081 --> 01:57:05,847
I'm waiting for you to show me
some goddamn gratitude.

1311
01:57:05,918 --> 01:57:10,719
Without me, you'd still just be
another sad-eyed, piano-playing drunk.

1312
01:57:10,790 --> 01:57:12,815
I brought you into this game.

1313
01:57:12,892 --> 01:57:15,156
I let you keep up with me.

1314
01:57:15,228 --> 01:57:18,994
- I made you a goddamn hero today.
- You didn't make me anything.

1315
01:57:19,065 --> 01:57:22,159
I redeemed your pathetic, shitty life.

1316
01:57:22,235 --> 01:57:25,363
I just did my job. You're the one
with the fucking pathetic life.

1317
01:57:25,438 --> 01:57:28,896
- Go ahead and shoot, damn it.
- They can't see inside.

1318
01:57:28,975 --> 01:57:30,442
If they fire, you'll be hit.

1319
01:57:30,510 --> 01:57:32,603
I want you to thank me first.

1320
01:57:32,678 --> 01:57:35,579
- Shut up and shoot.
- All right.

1321
01:57:37,950 --> 01:57:39,440
All right.

1322
01:57:39,519 --> 01:57:43,649
Shooters, stand by to fire.
Wait for my command.

1323
01:57:45,425 --> 01:57:49,361
- Sleep well, my friend.
- Just one thing: Aim high.

1324
01:57:49,429 --> 01:57:51,329
- What?
- Aim high.

1325
01:57:52,198 --> 01:57:54,257
- Now.
- You bastard!

1326
01:58:45,852 --> 01:58:48,377
Take my hand.

1327
01:58:48,454 --> 01:58:50,285
If you don't, you'll die.

1328
01:58:50,356 --> 01:58:52,256
You want to save me?

1329
01:58:52,325 --> 01:58:55,783
To be honest and fair with you, no.

1330
01:58:56,996 --> 01:58:58,486
But it's my job.

1331
01:58:58,564 --> 01:59:00,725
All you people, stay back!

1332
01:59:04,303 --> 01:59:05,531
Take it.

1333
02:00:01,427 --> 02:00:03,861
- You okay?
- Stand back, please.

1334
02:00:08,768 --> 02:00:11,862
We've been working with Agent Horrigan
for quite some time.

1335
02:00:11,938 --> 02:00:14,964
Yes, Frank exemplifies
courage and self-sacrifice.

1336
02:00:16,976 --> 02:00:20,707
Guess I overreacted again,
huh, Harry?

1337
02:00:40,967 --> 02:00:42,730
Agent Horrigan, just a moment.

1338
02:00:42,802 --> 02:00:47,102
Agent Horrigan, why are you
retiring from the Secret Service?

1339
02:00:47,173 --> 02:00:49,038
Because I hate desk work...

1340
02:00:49,108 --> 02:00:51,576
and I'm too old
to run alongside limousines.

1341
02:00:51,644 --> 02:00:54,204
And thanks to you people
plastering my picture everywhere...

1342
02:00:54,313 --> 02:00:56,213
I'm no good for undercover work.

1343
02:00:56,315 --> 02:00:58,579
One more question!

1344
02:00:58,651 --> 02:01:00,209
How are you?

1345
02:01:00,319 --> 02:01:03,755
Frank, the president
sent his limo for you.

1346
02:01:03,823 --> 02:01:05,757
- That's the least he could do.
- Good.

1347
02:01:05,825 --> 02:01:08,419
I love public transportation.

1348
02:01:11,864 --> 02:01:13,297
Come on in.

1349
02:01:16,135 --> 02:01:19,434
- Make yourself at home.
- Mm-hmm.

1350
02:01:31,350 --> 02:01:34,080
- What do you think?
- I like it.

1351
02:01:36,155 --> 02:01:37,622
Hello, Frank.

1352
02:01:39,025 --> 02:01:42,791
By the time you hear this,
it'll be over.

1353
02:01:42,862 --> 02:01:45,956
The president
is most likely dead...

1354
02:01:45,998 --> 02:01:48,091
and so am I.

1355
02:01:48,167 --> 02:01:51,102
I wonder, Frank,
did you kill me?

1356
02:01:51,170 --> 02:01:53,468
Who won our game?

1357
02:01:53,539 --> 02:01:55,803
Not that it matters.

1358
02:01:55,875 --> 02:01:57,638
For among friends,
like you and me...

1359
02:01:57,710 --> 02:02:00,110
it's not whether you win or lose,
but how you play the game.

1360
02:02:00,179 --> 02:02:04,809
Now the game is done, and it's time
to get on with your life.

1361
02:02:06,185 --> 02:02:09,643
But I worry that you have
no life to get on with.

1362
02:02:11,557 --> 02:02:13,115
You're a good man...

1363
02:02:13,192 --> 02:02:15,820
and good men,
like you and me...

1364
02:02:15,895 --> 02:02:18,659
are destined to travel
the lonely road.

1365
02:02:19,899 --> 02:02:23,062
Good-bye and good luck.

1366
02:02:26,906 --> 02:02:29,500
I'll bet you
that brown pigeon down there...

1367
02:02:29,575 --> 02:02:32,305
flies off before the white one.

1368
02:02:32,411 --> 02:02:33,844
How do you know?

1369
02:02:35,310 --> 02:02:38,280
I know things about pigeons.

1370
02:02:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
