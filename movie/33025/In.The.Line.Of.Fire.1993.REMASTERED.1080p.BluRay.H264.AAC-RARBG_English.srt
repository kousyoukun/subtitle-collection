1
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,664
Oh, my god!

2
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:34,501
Frank, thank god! I'm dead.

3
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,461
I'm dead.

4
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:44,682
Frank, I'm sorry. I got lost.
This town is so confusing.

5
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:52,063
What a day.
My wife had to work early.

6
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:58,533
My kid was crying when I took him to
school. He hated to leave Chicago.

7
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:04,405
- It broke my heart, frank.
- Any more excuses?

8
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:09,918
- No.
- Good. In the future be punctual.

9
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:14,965
- You got it?
- I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

10
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:34,106
- Frank, how are you doing?
- It's good to see you again.

11
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:39,941
- Hi, Marty. Sorry we're late.
- Al, go help Jimmy and Raul.

12
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:45,070
Yeah, sure. This is his.

13
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:54,250
- You don't trust me?
- I live in a crappy neighborhood.

14
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:59,130
- Have you got that funny money?
- Yeah. Right here.

15
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,965
It looks good. It looks real good.

16
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:10,645
We're in business. Excellent.

17
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:15,476
There's just one problem.
This guy al...

18
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:21,031
He keeps asking all these questions
about my counterfeiter.

19
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:25,487
My instinct usually tells me
when something's wrong.

20
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,950
And there's something wrong.
So I had him followed.

21
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,957
He's a secret service agent, frank.

22
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:56,146
- What do you think I ought to do?
- Be sure the body doesn't wash up.

23
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,529
I want you to pop him for me, okay?

24
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:09,531
- I think maybe you're with him.
- You came to me, remember?

25
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:14,288
- So pop him. Show me I'm an asshole.
- I'm just a businessman.

26
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,415
So pop him...

27
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,543
And let's do some business.

28
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,481
Yes, frank, that's what I'm looking for.

29
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,442
Come on, let's go get an omelet.

30
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:51,409
Let me get my pistol.

31
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,207
My gun?

32
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,207
You're under arrest

33
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:14,227
You're under arrest, too.
Secret service

34
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:24,155
you knew from the weight
of the gun that it was empty, right?

35
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:28,575
There could have been
one bullet there.

36
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,280
Hey, frank.

37
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:39,791
Do you think we can go someplace
and talk about this?

38
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,849
You killed guys before, frank

39
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,724
does it get to you?

40
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,897
It gets to you.

41
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:06,147
I don't like this undercover stuff.
I was so scared.

42
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:13,070
I joined the secret service...

43
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,953
To protect people.

44
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:22,041
You like the idea of
throwing yourself in front of a gun?

45
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:26,466
Hoping you get hit instead of
the guy you're protecting?

46
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,299
I don't know. Maybe I'm...

47
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:40,689
- Maybe I'm just wrong for the job.
- You're a good man, al.

48
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:46,111
- You'll make a good agent.
- How do you know?

49
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:52,151
I know things about people.

50
00:06:54,122 --> 00:07:00,869
- Come on, let's eat.
- I've got to go home to my family.

51
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:06,207
A lot of guys warned me
you were a pain in the ass.

52
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:10,381
- I'll see you in the office.
- Damn! The office.

53
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,225
Monroe wants us to check this out.
“I'll take care of it.

54
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:21,146
- I'll go with you.
- No. Go hug your wife and kid.

55
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:33,113
I was not snooping,
but the smoke alarm was going off.

56
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:36,695
I got scared.

57
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:42,410
I got more scared
when I saw what was inside.

58
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:51,335
The smoke was from crumbs
in the oven he left on.

59
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,956
Thirty-one years
I've been in this country.

60
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:26,753
I love the United States.
I've been to the white house.

61
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:33,803
Only in the United States can just
anybody go to visit the president.

62
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:38,890
So when I saw this,
these killing things...

63
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:43,979
I called the police.
They called the secret service.

64
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,065
That was two days ago.

65
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:55,448
The president gets 1,400 threats
a year. We've got to check them all.

66
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:09,080
- You say his name's mccauley?
- No, mccrawley, from Denver.

67
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:18,718
I remember it like yesterday.
I cried and cried.

68
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,550
Joseph mccrawley, Denver.

69
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,229
Died over 30 years ago, age 11.

70
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,728
Your guy got
a duplicate birth certificate...

71
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:13,561
Then used it to get a driver's license.

72
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,863
- Thanks, Jack.
- See you.

73
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,038
Federal agents. Open up!

74
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:22,091
Oh, my god! That's you.

75
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,876
- Yeah?
- Frank horrigan?

76
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:39,707
- Yeah?
- The secret service agent?

77
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:44,921
- Yeah. What did I win”?
- My god, it's really you?

78
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:50,850
- Who the hell is this?
- That was you in my apartment.

79
00:12:57,235 --> 00:13:02,400
- Mccrawley?
- Why not call me booth?

80
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:07,109
- Why not oswald?
- Booth had flair and panache.

81
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:11,697
The leap to the stage
after he shot Lincoln

82
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:18,044
- where are you?
- Closer than you'd imagine.

83
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:22,591
It's very exciting to talk to you.
I feel like I know you.

84
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:28,055
I've read about you and seen photos.
You were jfk's favorite agent.

85
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:32,555
But that was a long time ago.
What keeps you going?

86
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,096
Let's get together and talk.

87
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:40,270
I think the less you know about me,
the better

88
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:46,273
I'm planning to kill the president.
You shouldn't have said that

89
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:51,282
threatening the president is a federal
offense, even if you don't mean it.

90
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:54,114
I mean it

91
00:13:54,208 --> 00:14:01,125
one need only be willing to trade
ohe's own life for the president's.

92
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:05,959
- That's right.
- I'm willing.

93
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:11,299
Going up against you raises
the game to a much higher level.

94
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:16,811
Fate has brought us together, frank.

95
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:23,277
- I just can't get over the irony.
- What irony?

96
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:28,569
Your intimate involvement with
the assassinations of two presidents.

97
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,624
Hang on a second.
I've got something on the stove.

98
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:13,030
He was a tenant for three weeks.

99
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:18,206
What's really weird is the other
tenants never really saw him.

100
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:22,327
Statements vary.
He was between 5'8 " and 6'2".

101
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:26,547
Between 165 and 180 pounds.

102
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:30,502
Age? Between 28 and 45

103
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:44,225
Before an election, panic is what
you've got on a good day.

104
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:47,394
- They're waiting for you.
- Hey, frank.

105
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,605
- Sam.
- It's been a long time.

106
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:57,784
- I hear the new director isn't much fun.
- I've been the director for two years.

107
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:02,208
Al d'Andrea.
You know Matt Wilder.

108
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:06,254
He still owes me $20
from super bowl 21.

109
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:11,255
This is agent-in-charge bill watts
and Lilly Raines.

110
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:17,306
- She's very pretty for a secretary.
- And you're very old for an agent.

111
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,759
Lilly's an agent.

112
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:24,439
I just wanted to see
if she had a sense of humor.

113
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:28,438
Have a seat.
Let's talk about this guy.

114
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:32,898
I guess we're calling him
booth for now.

115
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:37,778
- What do you know about him?
- He's dangerous.

116
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:42,741
- How do you know?
- I know things about people.

117
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:47,078
Why didn't you take steps
to know more that first night?

118
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,465
- We had a busy day.
- Too busy to investigate properly?

119
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:56,922
- A 10-minute search of his room?
- I didn't have a warrant.

120
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:01,642
- Given your reputation...
- What reputation is that?

121
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:05,855
- Let's get back on track.
- What are you referring to?

122
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,271
Am I paranoid,
or is he busting my balls?

123
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,357
Probably a little of both.

124
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:18,777
Bill, there was a time around here
when I was almost as arrogant as you.

125
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:25,455
I don't have time for this. I've got
to pull 75 agents out of Miami.

126
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,420
Keep me posted, Sam, will you?

127
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,179
- So what do we do with this guy?
- We keep investigating.

128
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:41,850
- Tap my phone.
- Will he call again?

129
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:46,600
He'll call. He's got panache.
Panache?

130
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,979
- Yes, it means flamboyance.
- I know what it means.

131
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:55,947
- Really”? I had to look it up.
- All right, we'll tap your phone.

132
00:17:56,701 --> 00:18:01,946
By the way, watts isn't nearly
as arrogant as you were.

133
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:12,293
Just what reputation was watts
referring to, Sam?

134
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:15,216
You know.

135
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,794
Is it because I'm considered
9 borderline burn-out

136
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:22,382
with questionable social skills”?

137
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:28,096
What do you want to talk to me
about, besides your reputation?

138
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,853
I want to be assigned
to the president.

139
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:37,314
Protection? After all these years?
Frank, you're a dinosaur.

140
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:43,111
- This guy's gonna make a try.
- Watts will fight me all the way.

141
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,413
You owe it to me.

142
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,869
- I've kept you in a job.
- I've got to come back.

143
00:18:55,801 --> 00:19:01,762
Do you really want
to stand post again? At your age?

144
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:08,015
Yeah, I've got at least
one pair of good shoes somewhere.

145
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,789
We're stopping.
Traveler wants to work the ropes.

146
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,121
The French president's coming.
Get a security man up here.

147
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:40,479
Damn it! Get back.

148
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:08,472
- What's going on here?
- Horrigan had a heart attack.

149
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:17,274
- Hey, are you okay?
- Get the hell out of here.

150
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:21,693
- What's going on”?
- I had a call about a cardiac case.

151
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:26,275
- Are you all right, frank?
- I'm on my break here.

152
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,701
I get it, you bastards.

153
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,743
Who's the wise guy?

154
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:37,543
Okay, everybody, back to work.

155
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:46,586
- All right, who was the joker?
- It may not have been a joke.

156
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:53,017
- You were looking peaked today.
- I'll pay him back in spades.

157
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:56,721
How can you be sure it was a him?

158
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:08,362
- You've missed my street, al.
- Why don't you have a car?

159
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:12,570
I lived in New York a long time.
I like public transportation.

160
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:16,866
If you like buses,
why make me go out of my way?

161
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,711
I like your company.

162
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:27,961
He's a weird-looking guy.
“If he still looks like that.

163
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,392
Pull up over here.

164
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:11,254
The president's election troubles
were hardly apparent today.

165
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:16,809
He and the French president
stopped twice to greet the crowds.

166
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:22,641
The senate has yet to react
to the new French trade agreement.

167
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:29,322
The French will host a formal dinner
at their embassy for the president.

168
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,650
Presidential advisors are pleased...

169
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:37,284
With the publicity this
has brought in an election year.

170
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:43,332
It's a weird sub-culture, al.
Send some agents to check this out.

171
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:49,839
- Ask about some wackos.
- I'll get on it in the morning.

172
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:53,171
Hang on, I've got the other line.

173
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:58,301
- Yeah?
- Frank.

174
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:07,568
- Booth, how are you doing?
- I'm fine, thanks.

175
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:11,814
Hang on,
I'll get rid of the other call.

176
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:16,194
- You got it?
- Yeah, keep him talking.

177
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:23,083
- Yeah?
- Trying to trace me?

178
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:29,336
- Why didn't I think of that”?
- You did. You're a good adversary.

179
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:34,841
- But I was worried about you today.
- Why?

180
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:39,889
In the motorcade, I thought
you were going to pass out.

181
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:43,892
You should get in shape
for that kind of duty.

182
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:50,354
- Yeah, maybe you're right.
- I'm watching your movie.

183
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:56,534
- Movie?
- November '63. Kennedy's last days.

184
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:59,620
The arrival in Texas.

185
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:04,117
It must have been exciting.

186
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:09,376
Dallas. That morning at love field.

187
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:15,257
You all look so radiant.
Jfk, Jackie and you.

188
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:18,885
You look so young and able, frank.

189
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:22,135
What did happen to you that day?

190
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:28,270
The only agent to react to the shots
was farther away than you.

191
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:34,401
You must have looked up at that
window, but you didn't react.

192
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:38,947
Late at night when the demons come...

193
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:44,658
Do you see the rifle at the window,
or Kennedy's head being blown apart?

194
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:52,628
If you'd reacted in time,
could you have saved him?

195
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:59,180
If you had, that could've been
your head being blown apart.

196
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:04,932
Do you wish you'd succeeded,
or is life too precious?

197
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,804
What's done is done.

198
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,690
I have that esquire article
on the tenth anniversary...

199
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,487
About you and the other agents.

200
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:21,410
So sad how your wife left you
and took your little daughter.

201
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:26,498
You were so forthright
about your drinking problem.

202
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,622
And that you weren't easy to live with.

203
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,622
I was so moved by your honesty.

204
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:39,129
The world can be a cruel place
to an honest man.

205
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:43,098
What about you, booth?
What's your story?

206
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,931
It's an epic saga.

207
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:52,441
I'll talk to you again soon.
It's nice to have a friend.

208
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,742
- Did you get him?
- We got him.

209
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,220
He could have a device

210
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:31,306
that makes it look like
he's using another number.

211
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:36,526
- This device, how could he get it?
- He could build one.

212
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:41,240
- Can you trace it?
- We could run a parity check.

213
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:46,537
- Can you trace the call?
- Not if it's a para-analog line.

214
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:51,538
Give me a straight answer,
or al will shoot off his foot.

215
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:58,124
If he calls again, keep him on
the line. We'll see what we can do.

216
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:03,804
You might suggest that the police
don't knock down any more doors.

217
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,887
I have that esquire article

218
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:12,472
on the tenth anniversary
about you and the other agents.

219
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:18,728
So sad how your wife left you
and took your little daughter.

220
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:23,441
You were so forthright
about your drinking problem.

221
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,652
And that you weren't easy to live with.

222
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,868
I was so moved by your honesty.

223
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:37,496
- Okay, but why play it for me?
- Cancel the president's dinner.

224
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:45,346
The dinner at the French embassy?
This close to the election?

225
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,431
He manipulated the phone system.

226
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,850
He could have
knowledge of explosives.

227
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:55,557
- Do your job. There'll be no problems.
- There may be arms in the embassy.

228
00:28:56,109 --> 00:29:01,103
You think the French
want to knock off the president?

229
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,146
Why does every chief of staff...

230
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:08,118
You have no reason to think that
this is anything but an idle threat.

231
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:13,620
You want me to cancel a state dinner
and risk offending the French?

232
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:20,085
This guy's pushed your buttons
and you're overreacting a little.

233
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:23,963
I'm trying to protect your boss.
Soam I.

234
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:29,261
We're trailing 12 points in the polls,
and the election's in six weeks.

235
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,678
He's got to be seen.
Even if it kills him?

236
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,484
How could being down 12 points
look like good news?

237
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,437
The president was even worse off
weeks ago.

238
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:57,334
The president and first lady
of the United States

239
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:01,755
his excellency, the
president of France and his wife.

240
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:46,341
Agent Raines,
you look devastating tonight.

241
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:49,545
- Thank you.
- Good enough to eat, I might add...

242
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:53,097
If you'll pardon the expression.

243
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:58,100
I try to sympathize with you,
but you really do annoy me.

244
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,393
Why sympathize?

245
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:05,394
The tape of that phone call.
When he mentioned your wife.

246
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:09,364
- Ex-wife.
- At any rate, I'm sorry.

247
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:15,868
Strange, I get sympathy from
an assassin and a woman I annoy.

248
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:20,242
- Would you care to dance?
- Perhaps some other time.

249
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:22,669
I get off in a couple of hours.

250
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:30,010
- What are you looking at?
- Where do you hide your firearm?

251
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,009
Don't tell me, let me guess.

252
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,566
We're on our final approach to L.A.

253
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:48,737
The temperature is a balmy 76 degrees.
It's a beautiful day out there.

254
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:52,988
Thanks for flying with us.
We hope to see you again.

255
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:17,888
- Deposit this in the new account.
- I'll need to see your papers.

256
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:27,101
"Microspan corporation.”
what kind of business are you in?

257
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:31,359
- Software.
- Up in San Jose?

258
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,409
I'm based there,
but I'm opening an office in L.A.

259
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:40,744
You're not from San Jose?
Where are you from?

260
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:45,410
- Minneapolis.
- You're kidding! So am I.

261
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:50,336
Well, it's a small world.

262
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:56,054
I hated the winters.
I used to stay in and pig out.

263
00:32:56,141 --> 00:33:02,853
- What high school did you go to?
- New Brighton high school.

264
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:11,487
There isn't any new Brighton.
There was when I was there.

265
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,820
Well, maybe I'm just confused.
It happens a lot.

266
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:22,782
- There was a school across from...
- I'm late, will this take long?

267
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:26,163
Not at all, just another minute.

268
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:30,543
Thank you.

269
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:41,175
- You have a very pleasant manner.
- Thank you, Mr. carney.

270
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:57,901
How would you like
to give a colleague a ride home?

271
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:02,495
Why do you keep flirting with me?
Am I?

272
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:08,077
- You know it can't go anywhere.
- That's why I do it.

273
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:12,586
Come on, I'll buy you an ice cream.
No further obligations.

274
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:15,296
Oh, boy.

275
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:22,758
How many female agents are there?
About 125

276
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:28,556
- pure window dressing.
- Excuse me?

277
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:34,399
Window dressing.
125 out of 2,000.

278
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:39,700
You're around so the president
looks good to his feminist voters.

279
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:45,072
- Do make an effort to be obnoxious?
- It's a gift.

280
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:50,502
We do a lot of window dressing.
Like running with the limousine.

281
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:54,923
It'd take an anti-tank missile
to put a dentin it.

282
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:59,549
But it makes the president
look more presidential.

283
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:05,225
If I'm here for the feminist vote,
what demographics do you represent?

284
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,719
I et's see.

285
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:11,227
White, piano-playing,
heterosexuals over the age of 50.

286
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:16,483
There ain't a lot of us,
but we do have a powerful lobby.

287
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:24,157
- Time flies when you're annoyed.
- Where are you going?

288
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,533
I have a date. “With whom?

289
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:29,908
That's none of your business.

290
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:34,497
- You want a ride?
- I don't think so.

291
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:38,960
I like it here this time of day.
I think I'll hang out.

292
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:42,592
Okay, thanks for the ice cream.

293
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:46,095
See you. You're welcome.

294
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,814
If she looks back,
that means she's interested.

295
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:07,322
Come on now, give me that
smug look and be on your way.

296
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:22,465
Well, Abe... damn, I wish
I could've been there for you.

297
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:35,141
Hi, baby, how are you doing?

298
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:39,186
Yes, I missed you too.

299
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:49,155
I didn't mean to startle you. I got
your address from the phone book.

300
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:56,212
- I'm not listed.
- Well, I better come clean.

301
00:36:56,297 --> 00:37:01,007
I followed you. I'm sorry,
I'm not very good at this.

302
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:07,590
I'm new in town. I was wondering
if you'd care to join me for dinner.

303
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:11,888
That's sweet, but...

304
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:17,100
I also wanted to apologize for lying
to you about being from Minneapolis.

305
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,935
I shouldn't ask so many questions.

306
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:26,491
Did you mention our conversation
to anyone at the bank?

307
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:29,820
- No!
- May I?

308
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,954
Rory, settle down!

309
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:40,835
- Pam, what's going on? Oh, hi.
- This is my roommate.

310
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:46,886
- Sally, this is Mr. carney.
- Nice to meet you.

311
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:52,677
- I was just on my way out.
- I'm sorry, but you can't leave.

312
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,978
What?

313
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:58,477
You shouldn't have been
from Minneapolis.

314
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:02,231
I don't know what you want, but...

315
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:26,753
- Hi, this is Sally.
- This is Pam. We're not in right now.

316
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:32,591
- Leave your name and number.
- And we'll call you back. Bye.

317
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:45,650
Frank, I hope you don't mind me
calling you at the office.

318
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:49,779
No, why don't you drop by?
I'd love to

319
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:54,488
let me take some time to welcome
those who are joining us late.

320
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:58,659
I'd love to drop by.
We've got so much in common.

321
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:02,211
We do? Like what?

322
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:05,416
We're both willing to trade
our lives for the president's.

323
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:10,049
We were both betrayed
by those we trusted.

324
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:14,132
- I wasn't betrayed, booth.
- Sure you were, frank.

325
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:19,388
The Warren commission reported your
procedure as seriously deficient.

326
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:24,439
They criticized all the agents for
being out drinking the night before.

327
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:30,358
As if Kennedy would be alive today
if you'd been in bed by 10 P.M.

328
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:37,702
- Maybe they were right.
- No, they weren't right.

329
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:43,162
You wanted to have agents stationed
all around his car he refused.

330
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:48,592
Do you know why?
Because he had a death wish.

331
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:51,294
He talked all the time
about being assassinated.

332
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,131
His favorite poem was
"I have a rendezvous with death"

333
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:57,763
which is not a good poem, frank.

334
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:59,219
I think he wanted to die.

335
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,268
And I think he didn't care that
his death would ruin your life.

336
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,315
I think he was a selfish bastard.

337
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,238
What do you think?

338
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:14,275
Frank?

339
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:20,491
- What about you? Who betrayed you?
- I don't think he's scrambling it.

340
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:26,330
Some of the same people,
but I'm going to get even.

341
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:32,507
I'll have my day in the sun.
The question is, will you?

342
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:36,306
I think you're in
for a lot more pain.

343
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:40,635
How much of this shit
do I have to listen to?

344
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,180
He's across the street.
Lafayette park.

345
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:46,607
Booth!

346
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:27,224
I told you to get in shape, frank.

347
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,153
Is this your current address?

348
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:44,161
And you didn't see anybody suspicious
hanging around that phone booth?

349
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:57,420
That's him! Al, that's him!

350
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:36,217
Secret service! I'm impounding
this car. He put his hand on here.

351
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:42,516
- We got fingerprints.
- Are you all right, frank?

352
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:35,897
Hey Tony, have a look at this.

353
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:41,449
- The print from secret service?
- Yeah, it's really strange.

354
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:44,699
This is c-12. We can't tell them.

355
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:53,833
Horrigan, I'm afraid
we've drawn a blank.

356
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:59,088
- You're sure?
- We ran it against everything.

357
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:10,474
I'm meeting with the president.
You keep investigating.

358
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:15,434
- What should I do?
- You'll think of something.

359
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:18,895
You're a real pain
when things don't go your way.

360
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,322
Your friends warned you about that.

361
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,586
The president
hit the campaign trail today

362
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:44,717
on a 6-day tour of 12 states.

363
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:50,601
With just a month to the election,
he's trailing by 10 points.

364
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:56,100
He'll concentrate on the midwest,
where he's sagging in the polls.

365
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:02,026
The campaign will wind up
in Chicago with a big rally.

366
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:12,074
Do you have a flight on Tuesday
from Washington to L.A.?

367
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:19,040
I'd like an open-ended ticket so I
can make some stops on my return.

368
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:23,798
C-95, off-load the choppers first.
Who's our route agent?

369
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:27,589
That'll be Jacqueline king.

370
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:32,552
This is watts,
we have arrival at 13:15

371
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:38,734
where are we keeping the cars?
Denver pd has an area for us.

372
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,152
This is watts,
we're ten minutes out.

373
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,654
Here in Denver we gather today
in the shadow of giants.

374
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:53,582
Brave pioneers who overcame the
wilderness and carved a new nation.

375
00:45:53,668 --> 00:45:59,083
Today we are asked
to match our vision to their vision.

376
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:02,916
And to pass that legacy on.

377
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:07,470
Is sector three secure?
Sector three is secure.

378
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:13,134
The president was campaigning
today in Denver.

379
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:29,534
We are living in a time
of global economic transition.

380
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:34,698
We need compassion and vision
to create a future

381
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:39,919
of peace and progress
for everyone.

382
00:46:40,006 --> 00:46:45,376
The president is due to arrive
here in I. A later in the month.

383
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:49,132
He'll compete for California's
54 electoral votes.

384
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,991
This is Sandy riggs calling.

385
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:16,289
If you want to catch a rally
in the midwest, you'd best call me.

386
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:19,996
The president has no fixed schedule.

387
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:27,004
In answer to your other question, just
send a check to party headquarters.

388
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:30,215
Ladies and gentlemen
of Holly, Michigan...

389
00:47:30,306 --> 00:47:33,673
The President of the United States.

390
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:41,064
We've gone a long way
toward achieving that goal...

391
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:46,110
We've got some trouble up ahead.
Notify the white house staff.

392
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:49,906
Milwaukee will be easy tomorrow.

393
00:47:55,664 --> 00:48:02,126
Flight 318 to Milwaukee
is now boarding at gate 21.

394
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:07,128
All passengers
proceed to the boarding area now.

395
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:15,260
Checking.

396
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:19,344
Hey, pal, found any bombs today?

397
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:29,446
Did the first lady ask about me?

398
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:31,739
Have you gotten to know them yet?

399
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:36,240
- I prefer not to get to know them.
- Why is that?

400
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,663
They might not be worth
taking a bullet for.

401
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:43,205
Here comes my replacement.
Let's go to the bar.

402
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:47,755
- We can't drink on the road.
- But they have a great piano player.

403
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:59,721
I've played for presidents
and with presidents.

404
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:04,146
Nixon and I once did
a duet of "moonglow."

405
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:08,818
- I heard he didn't like you.
- We got on all right.

406
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:12,359
His chief of staff didn't like me.

407
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:16,985
He once ordered me to get rid of
some anti-war protesters.

408
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:21,823
I said I couldn't do that.
Freedom of speech and such.

409
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:26,832
He said, "when I'm talking to you,
I am the president"

410
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:31,833
I said, "you look like a sack of shit
in a cheap suit to me, sir!"

411
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:36,007
- The "sir" was a classy touch.
- I thought so.

412
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:53,025
You never wear shades
when you're standing post.

413
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:56,858
I like the wackos
to see the whites of my eyes.

414
00:49:56,952 --> 00:50:02,618
A glare can be just as effective
as a gun. Know what I mean?

415
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:06,246
You know what I mean?

416
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:17,511
You got me.

417
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:21,007
You'd better stick to the shades,
sweetheart.

418
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:41,944
What are you afraid of?

419
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:46,745
I'm afraid of making a big mistake.

420
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:50,043
Good night.

421
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:51,142
Good, we've got some updates
on Milwaukee.

422
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,599
Thanks.

423
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:47,199
- Don't answer it.
- No. Oh, shit.

424
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:54,077
Raines.

425
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:06,672
Okay, I'll be right down.

426
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:15,310
Traveler's losing ground in
Georgia. Milwaukee's out tomorrow.

427
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:20,691
And they're staging a rally
somewhere outside Atlanta

428
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:25,699
damn!

429
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:33,036
What am I doing?

430
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:41,920
On, Lilly...

431
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:48,260
I've got to put all that shit
back on, damn it!

432
00:53:56,233 --> 00:54:00,977
I'm glad to see you all
out here in the rain with me today.

433
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:06,611
I've been saying,
"don't just vote for me, join me."

434
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:12,409
And today you certainly have.
We may get a tad damp today.

435
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:17,118
But guess who's gonna be all wet
on election day?

436
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:28,883
How about the watch list?

437
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:32,432
Twenty-three crazies
are under surveillance.

438
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,100
The hospital?

439
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:37,684
Extra units of traveler's
blood type are on hand.

440
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:40,767
Accessible to the alternate route too.

441
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:54,989
- Under the weather?
- Sick as a dog, Lilly.

442
00:54:55,918 --> 00:55:00,127
What's this”? "Psychological
profile of John booth"

443
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:03,835
did you make a mistake? “What?

444
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:08,795
You said you were afraid
of making a big mistake.

445
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:17,137
With this job, let's be realistic.
It's not like we work in a bank.

446
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:23,813
- You had an affair with an agent?
- He wasn't an agent.

447
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:29,072
But he left you
because you wouldn't quit your job?

448
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:33,615
I left him.
I wouldn't quit my job for him.

449
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:36,742
It broke my heart.

450
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:43,546
You vowed never again to let a man
come between you and your career.

451
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:49,047
But now you're in love with me and
it scares you a little, doesn't it?

452
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:53,009
- Blow your nose.
- Sorry.

453
00:55:56,854 --> 00:56:03,100
What would happen
if I gave up my job for you?

454
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:09,776
Why would you do that?

455
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:15,032
I vowed never again to let my career
come between me and a woman.

456
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:23,999
Frank

457
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:28,590
hey, be careful, will you”?
Yeah?

458
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:32,386
This whole event's been advertised
in advance. Just be alert

459
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:51,902
Watts, it's horrigan, it's a zoo here.
We gotta take traveler underground.

460
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:57,403
This is watts. We are using the
alternate arrival site. Underground.

461
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:16,965
- Watts, booth may be here.
- I thought you couldn't identify him.

462
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:22,807
- I can't. Just call it a hunch.
- Ignore your psychic abilities.

463
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:25,977
All posts take to your positions.

464
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:31,112
- You've got a fever, frank.
- You stay alert in there, will you?

465
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:40,951
One quality above all
marks this president.

466
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:46,376
It has earned him the respect
of the people of this country.

467
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:50,214
That quality is courage.

468
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,549
The question is,

469
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:58,384
will we stand
by the man who has stood by us?

470
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:02,642
- Stage right?
- Stage right, all clear.

471
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:07,056
- Stage left?
- Stage left, clear.

472
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:11,519
- Stage center?
- Stage center, clear.

473
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:18,984
The President of the United States
and the first lady!

474
00:58:57,409 --> 00:59:00,651
- Gun!
- Get down!

475
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:17,551
What the hell's going on in there?

476
00:59:20,432 --> 00:59:23,139
All clear.

477
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:28,061
- False alarm.
- Traveler's secure. Resume positions.

478
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:32,061
- Are you hurt, Mr. president?
- I'm all right.

479
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,935
Everything's all right, folks.

480
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:40,699
We had a little false alarm there.

481
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:46,163
That was exciting, wasn't it?
Take your seat, please.

482
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:52,795
It was just a balloon popping.
Traveler wants to continue.

483
01:00:15,654 --> 01:00:19,272
Do you have any idea how many
votes you cost us last night?

484
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:22,115
The president looked like a coward.

485
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:27,033
He looked all right. You were
the one who looked like a coward.

486
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:31,082
- Is this just a joke to you?
- No, you're a joke to me.

487
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:34,078
- You have no idea what we do.
- That's enough!

488
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:37,831
I'll have you busting
counterfeiters in Alaska!

489
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:42,503
Keep him away from the white house
and away from me!

490
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:45,760
The man's a disgrace.
You can't talk to him like that.

491
01:00:45,851 --> 01:00:47,136
I don't work for him.

492
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:53,139
You work for me. At least
you did. You're off my detail.

493
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:06,861
My super bowl debt. In case
I don't see you after this trip.

494
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:17,333
You know, frank...

495
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:22,459
If you just acknowledge that
it was an unfortunate situation...

496
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:26,968
- I'm not going to apologize.
- I'm not saying you should.

497
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:31,142
- But the president was humiliated.
- He's alive

498
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:35,222
- we are here to save his dignity too.
- I'm not paid for that.

499
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:41,654
When Kennedy's girlfriend got into
trouble, you said she was with you.

500
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:49,245
- That was just a rumor.
- I heard the whole story.

501
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:54,371
You were suspended for a month
in order to save his dignity.

502
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:59,042
- He was different.
- Maybe you were different.

503
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:03,045
I was different.
The whole country was different.

504
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:08,798
Everything would be different if I'd
been half as paranoid as I am today.

505
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:17,393
Frank

506
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:36,291
Why not just retire? Live off
your pension. What's the point?

507
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:42,672
Somebody else asked me that
not long ago.

508
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:46,718
You don't spend any money,
except on jazz records.

509
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:50,969
I want to stay
on the booth case, Sam.

510
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:56,478
All right, but as for
protective detail...

511
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:59,146
I understand.

512
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:07,948
That thing in Chicago...

513
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:12,653
I've never been on the wrong side
of a judgment call like that.

514
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:17,958
You had the flu!
That can impair your judgment.

515
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:23,710
Face it, frank.
You're too old for this shit.

516
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:20,304
Hello.

517
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:24,107
What happened
in the windy city, frank?

518
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:27,106
Booth?

519
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:33,238
Did the balloon get you panicky?
You were there.

520
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:34,818
Yes, yes.

521
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:39,118
I couldn't help wondering

522
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:43,794
why you'd risk your life
to save such a man.

523
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:49,212
You have such a strange job. I can't
decide if it's heroic or absurd.

524
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:54,547
Why would you risk your life
to kill a man like that?

525
01:04:54,641 --> 01:04:59,556
- Read my psychological profile.
- I don't believe in them

526
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:04,640
nor do I. A man's actions don't equal
the sum of his psychological parts.

527
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:07,567
It doesn't work that way.
“Just how does it work?

528
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:18,616
It doesn't work. God doesn't punish
the wicked and reward the righteous.

529
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:23,120
Everyone dies.
Some die because they deserve to.

530
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:29,207
Others die because they come
from Minneapolis. It's meaningless.

531
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:33,885
If none of this means anything,
why kill the president?

532
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:41,097
- To punctuate the dreariness.
- You need to get yourself laid.

533
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:47,183
You're the same. Name one thing
in your life that has any meaning.

534
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,773
- I play the piano.
- That's not enough.

535
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:53,480
How do you know? Do you play?

536
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:58,360
I've seen you in your bar alone.

537
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:05,122
There's no cause worth fighting for.
All we have is the game.

538
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:09,955
- I'm on offense. You're on defense.
- When do we start playing the game?

539
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:14,710
The clock's ticking, frank.
Take care.

540
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,967
Wait. Wait, booth.

541
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:25,103
He scrambled it. I missed him.

542
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:28,023
Fuck!

543
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,436
Fucker.

544
01:06:57,305 --> 01:06:59,921
Jesus, frank.

545
01:07:01,226 --> 01:07:06,186
I called for hours.
I thought something happened to you.

546
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:08,225
No, I'm not okay.

547
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:13,818
I'm sick, I'm tired
and I'm armed, too. So be careful.

548
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:19,491
- You're also maybe a genius.
- Not to be recognized in this lifetime.

549
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:22,944
- Did you listen to the call”?
- Yeah, remember...?

550
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:25,197
Call the field office in Minneapolis.

551
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,619
See what you can find
about accidental deaths.

552
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:31,294
Frank!
Will you listen to me, please?

553
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:36,087
- Spit it out, damn it!
- We spoke to some model builders.

554
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:41,672
There is a professor at Pasadena
college.

555
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:43,631
I think we've got something.

556
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:48,811
I met him at a design conference
in New Orleans a year ago.

557
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:54,643
We ordered a few rounds of drinks.
He seemed like a nice enough guy.

558
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:58,776
But when we talked politics
he got a nasty edge.

559
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:05,487
He said the government betrayed him
and he was out for revenge.

560
01:08:05,582 --> 01:08:08,665
The way he said it scared me.

561
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:13,745
I said, "nice talking to you."
And I got the hell out of there.

562
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:18,925
For the life of me
I cannot remember his name.

563
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:23,381
But I'm pretty sure
he said he was from Phoenix.

564
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:29,515
You ought to talk to a guy
in Phoenix named Walter wickland.

565
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:35,017
- We're going to Phoenix.
- Let's get a police artist.

566
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:40,856
- Have a sketch faxed to us.
- You figured that out by yourself?

567
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:45,865
- Kiss my ass, frank.
- I told you you'd make a good agent.

568
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:53,369
That doesn't look much like him,
but it's got to be Mitch leary.

569
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:59,546
- I haven't seen him in over a year.
- What do you know about the guy?

570
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:04,045
You see this wheelchair?
Mitch bought it for me.

571
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:08,008
It cost over $1,000.

572
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:12,220
- You see this?
- Take it easy now.

573
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:15,773
This is in case he ever comes back.

574
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:19,318
He accused me
of ripping off his design.

575
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:22,897
He said my penalty for disloyalty
was death

576
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:26,819
if you put him away,
I'll sleep better.

577
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:32,370
- Where can we find him?
- I've got his address somewhere.

578
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:46,110
Don't move.

579
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:57,875
Drop it!

580
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:13,470
- Let him go, horrigan.
- I got him.

581
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:18,476
It's okay. We're on the same team.

582
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:24,482
- Hands, motherfucker!
- I'm getting my identification!

583
01:11:25,406 --> 01:11:28,944
- Give it to me.
- David coppinger. CIA.

584
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:34,783
- And who's this asshole?
- He's with me.

585
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:40,043
- Goddamn it!
- Are you here for leary or me?

586
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:44,835
Mr. leary used to be
one of our operatives.

587
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:51,380
He's threatened to kill the president.
“We didn't think he was serious.

588
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:54,511
- But you knew. You and the FBI.
- I understand your frustration.

589
01:11:54,602 --> 01:11:58,845
You understand my frustration?
You pompous son of a bitch!

590
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:04,233
What did leary do for you?
Run drugs? Sell arms to Iran?

591
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:09,026
It's a c-12 matter,
so this is off the record.

592
01:12:09,116 --> 01:12:11,072
If asked, I'm going to deny it.

593
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:20,079
- Leary's what we call a wet boy.
- What's a wet boy, frank?

594
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:21,667
Leary's an assassin.

595
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:28,500
He's more like a predator.

596
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:49,779
Was that you shooting? Yes

597
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:54,986
- what kind of gun is that?
- Something I made.

598
01:12:55,913 --> 01:13:00,577
You made it?
That beats paying for it.

599
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:03,626
Can I see it? Yeah

600
01:13:04,547 --> 01:13:09,291
- it's light. What's it made of?
- It's composite. Like plastic.

601
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:14,596
Pretty neat!
Mind if I give her a little dance?

602
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:18,425
- Not at all.
- Go for it.

603
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:29,944
That is great! That is really great!

604
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:39,829
- Would you sell it”?
- No, I need it.

605
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:45,668
- For what?
- To assassinate the president.

606
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:58,094
- Why would you want to do that for?
- Why did you kill that bird, asshole?

607
01:14:05,483 --> 01:14:10,819
Leary was one of our most effective
contractors, but times changed.

608
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:15,691
Cutbacks had to be made.
Leary didn't take it too well.

609
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:21,701
- We've not been able to locate him.
- We can work together on this.

610
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:27,123
- Wouldn't that be refreshing?
- We have fingerprints and photos.

611
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:33,675
- These are at least 15 years old.
- He's camera-shy.

612
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:40,177
He'll be in disguise, anyway.
We need photo alterations, Sam.

613
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:45,728
What I'm about to show you
is highly classified.

614
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:51,734
This is a former colleague
of leary's. A close friend.

615
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:57,236
He went by leary's home to try
and get him to accept counseling.

616
01:14:57,493 --> 01:15:01,702
This is how leary
treats his friends.

617
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:08,034
We need every possible variable.

618
01:15:08,129 --> 01:15:13,249
Facial hair, glasses, weight change.

619
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:17,051
Keep in mind
he's 15 years older now.

620
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:43,824
As good as they are, they aren't
much good. The eyes are dead.

621
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:48,032
You can always tell a man
by his eyes.

622
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:52,749
- Tomorrow morning I'd like you to...
- I'm resigning tomorrow.

623
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,752
What?

624
01:15:55,843 --> 01:16:01,429
What for'? Because you were scared
down in Phoenix? I was scared too.

625
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:09,304
About that boat
with the bag over my head.

626
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:13,482
I can't breathe.
Phoenix clinched it

627
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:19,606
- the service has counselors.
- I've been to counselors.

628
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:24,786
- We can get this guy.
- I can't do it!

629
01:16:24,872 --> 01:16:31,789
Stop this cockamamie shit.
Come on, pal, I need you.

630
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:34,712
Please.

631
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:43,130
Okay, frank.

632
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:54,811
Cockamamie. That's a word
your generation hasn't embraced yet.

633
01:16:54,902 --> 01:16:59,487
You ought to use it once in a while
to keep it alive.

634
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:02,861
Cockamamie! Yeah

635
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:06,319
- oh, god!
- Well, it made you laugh.

636
01:17:06,413 --> 01:17:08,449
You kill me, frank.

637
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:15,415
Hello.

638
01:17:15,506 --> 01:17:21,843
Hello, frank. And let me welcome
all of you joining our program.

639
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:26,342
I know who you are, leary.

640
01:17:31,564 --> 01:17:36,558
I'm glad. Friends should be able
to call each other by name.

641
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:40,190
- We're not friends.
- Sure, we are.

642
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:42,400
I've seen what you do to friends.

643
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:49,575
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You slit your friend's throat.

644
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:03,467
You talked to coppinger? Yeah

645
01:18:03,554 --> 01:18:07,547
did you de-louse?
The man's a professional liar.

646
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:09,386
I saw the photos.

647
01:18:09,476 --> 01:18:12,513
No, you saw what
he wanted you to see.

648
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:16,351
I saw a picture of your friend
with his throat cut.

649
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:21,478
What you don't know
is that they sent my best friend...

650
01:18:21,572 --> 01:18:26,316
To my home to kill me!

651
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:31,116
- Your voice is shaking.
- I haven't lied to you, frank!

652
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:35,917
Everyone who ever knew you
says you're sick.

653
01:18:36,003 --> 01:18:41,293
- Your colleagues. Your wife.
- What does your wife say about you?

654
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:45,467
Frank, I want you to understand.

655
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:51,265
We both used to think that this
country was a very special place.

656
01:18:51,352 --> 01:18:57,097
Do you have any idea
what I've done for god and country?

657
01:18:57,191 --> 01:18:59,933
Some horrible things!

658
01:19:00,027 --> 01:19:04,896
I don't even remember who I was
before they got their claws into me.

659
01:19:05,282 --> 01:19:07,568
They made you into a real monster.

660
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:12,745
And now they want to destroy me.

661
01:19:15,918 --> 01:19:19,786
What do you see when you're in
the dark and the demons come?

662
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:25,916
I see you, frank.

663
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:31,260
I see you standing over the grave
of another dead president.

664
01:19:31,809 --> 01:19:34,801
- That's not gonna happen.
- Fuck you, frank.

665
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:40,481
I'm willing to trade my life
for his and that's all it takes.

666
01:19:40,567 --> 01:19:44,776
That president is coming home
from California in a box.

667
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:49,816
Where in California?
The address?

668
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:54,199
I'll keep you in the game,
but I won't throw it for you.

669
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:59,701
- I want you to give yourself up.
- To live a long and fruitful life?

670
01:20:01,964 --> 01:20:06,549
Don't lie to me.
I have a rendezvous with death

671
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:11,004
so does the president.
And so do you, if you get too close.

672
01:20:11,098 --> 01:20:13,885
You have a rendezvous
with my ass, motherfucker!

673
01:20:13,976 --> 01:20:18,436
You know how easily I could kill you?

674
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:22,185
I've watched you go home.

675
01:20:22,276 --> 01:20:25,643
You are alive because
I have allowed you to live.

676
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:30,152
Show me some damn respect!

677
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:42,834
St Francis hotell

678
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:00,519
Frank.

679
01:23:56,657 --> 01:23:59,899
Take my hand, frank.

680
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:04,328
Take it. If you don't, you'll die.

681
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:11,039
Take it

682
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:30,228
You're gonna shoot me
after I saved your life?

683
01:24:33,443 --> 01:24:35,104
Shit.

684
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:39,946
The only way to save the president
is to shoot me.

685
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:43,946
Are you willing
to trade your life for his...

686
01:24:44,037 --> 01:24:47,404
Or is life too precious?

687
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:11,477
I got him!

688
01:25:15,569 --> 01:25:18,777
Al?

689
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:56,932
There's nothing here.

690
01:26:46,827 --> 01:26:50,786
Frank, you've got a phone call.

691
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:01,922
Yeah?

692
01:27:02,008 --> 01:27:06,718
Frank, you looked so sad on the bus.
I'm sorry, it was self-defense.

693
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:18,939
- Tell me about skellum.
- Skellum is worthless

694
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:24,732
- are you gonna meet him in L.A.?
- You're way behind in the game.

695
01:27:25,031 --> 01:27:29,274
I'm way ahead. I know what you
look like. I've seen your eyes.

696
01:27:29,369 --> 01:27:32,611
- They might look different next time.
- Not what's behind them

697
01:27:32,873 --> 01:27:37,958
- you better pray I never find you.
- You want to kill me, frank?

698
01:27:38,044 --> 01:27:41,127
That's right.

699
01:27:41,214 --> 01:27:45,298
- The irony's so thick here.
- There is no irony!

700
01:27:45,385 --> 01:27:51,472
The same government that trained
me to kill, trained you to protect.

701
01:27:51,558 --> 01:27:55,471
Now you want to kill me.
Up on that roof I protected you.

702
01:27:55,562 --> 01:27:57,473
They'll write books about us.

703
01:27:57,564 --> 01:28:03,651
- I'm tired of your bullshit!
- Don't be a poor sport.

704
01:28:03,904 --> 01:28:07,772
You could have taken me out,
but you chose to save your ass.

705
01:28:07,866 --> 01:28:10,858
Don't cry about it now, okay?

706
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:15,533
It does make me wonder about Dallas.

707
01:28:15,624 --> 01:28:20,493
Did you really do all you could,
or did you make a choice there too?

708
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:28,174
Do you really have the guts
to take a bullet?

709
01:28:28,428 --> 01:28:32,592
I'll be thinking about that
when I'm pissing on your grave.

710
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:41,184
There's no one named skellum
in all of Los Angeles?

711
01:28:41,274 --> 01:28:45,517
- What about Louisiana?
- Hang on.

712
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:52,358
No skellums. Sorry.

713
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:55,194
Damn it!

714
01:29:03,421 --> 01:29:08,040
- The election's in three weeks.
- Just stay out of California.

715
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:12,169
If this guy's so smart, he's not gonna
tell you where he'll do it.

716
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:14,887
I don't think he'd lie to me.

717
01:29:14,975 --> 01:29:18,559
You've become that close?

718
01:29:18,645 --> 01:29:23,105
California is the key
to the whole race.

719
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:29,232
- We can't let up now.
- We have to change our procedure.

720
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:31,946
Frisk people within 50 yards.

721
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:35,696
At $10,000 dinners?

722
01:29:37,205 --> 01:29:41,539
- You're overreacting.
- If I don't, the president's dead.

723
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:46,086
- Why is he even here?
- He's heading this investigation.

724
01:29:46,172 --> 01:29:50,666
Then let him investigate,
but keep him out of sight.

725
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:55,220
If you'll excuse me,
I'm in the middle of a campaign.

726
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:06,894
Frank. Hi. “Hi

727
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:13,981
- up late?
- Ll. A will be a lot of work.

728
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:18,569
- What's up?
- I've got a request.

729
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:24,704
I'd like you to talk to watts.
Get me on your team.

730
01:30:29,299 --> 01:30:34,293
- He thinks you'll overreact.
- What do you think?

731
01:30:34,387 --> 01:30:39,802
- You're too close to all this.
- That's why I've got to be there.

732
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:45,145
I can spot him. Anticipate him.
You think he'll be in California?

733
01:30:45,231 --> 01:30:51,272
- Why would he tip you off?
- He wants to keep the game close.

734
01:30:54,366 --> 01:30:59,861
This has nothing to do with
you and me. Strictly professional.

735
01:31:00,538 --> 01:31:04,531
But that son of a bitch
killed my partner. My friend.

736
01:31:05,126 --> 01:31:08,789
I know. I'm sorry.

737
01:31:13,259 --> 01:31:16,296
You're looking at a living legend.

738
01:31:16,554 --> 01:31:20,968
The only active agent
who ever lost a president.

739
01:31:23,436 --> 01:31:26,143
Please.

740
01:31:40,036 --> 01:31:42,618
Mr. horrigan, welcome to Los Angeles.

741
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:49,706
Can the president close the gap
in the little time he has left?

742
01:31:49,796 --> 01:31:55,792
Today he's in California for a rally
at the bonaventure hotel

743
01:32:05,103 --> 01:32:10,473
Field office, the advance team
is at the bonaventure.

744
01:32:58,656 --> 01:33:01,523
- Any problems?
- No.

745
01:33:06,623 --> 01:33:10,286
We've swept the motorcade route.

746
01:33:10,376 --> 01:33:16,337
Manholes are secured. Mailboxes
removed. Abandoned vehicles towed.

747
01:33:22,347 --> 01:33:26,807
We'll need sharpshooters
on both those towers.

748
01:33:26,893 --> 01:33:32,263
We need sharpshooters
to cover those restricted areas.

749
01:33:32,357 --> 01:33:36,521
Other polls today had the president
three points behind.

750
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:41,150
He'll have to close that margin
in California

751
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:53,742
Welcome to Los Angeles
international airport.

752
01:35:51,162 --> 01:35:58,000
- Raines, double-checking those exits?
- Yes, this is the third time now.

753
01:36:07,553 --> 01:36:10,590
Alert, section five.

754
01:36:16,938 --> 01:36:19,896
Secret service.

755
01:36:27,448 --> 01:36:29,188
Robert stermer.

756
01:36:31,536 --> 01:36:34,699
He's a bellboy. He's cleared.

757
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:42,787
- Robert, have a nice day.
- No questions.

758
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:47,374
Come on, pack it up and move.

759
01:36:48,094 --> 01:36:51,837
Mr. carney, all set.

760
01:36:51,931 --> 01:36:55,515
Finally we meet!
You are James carney?

761
01:36:55,601 --> 01:37:02,313
- You must be Sandy riggs.
- So you really do exist.

762
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:08,441
- I'm very much human.
- Let's go up to the bar.

763
01:37:10,158 --> 01:37:15,027
- When does the president arrive?
- Tomorrow, before dinner.

764
01:37:15,121 --> 01:37:21,208
Here's an invitation. Don't lose it.
The secret service is acting crazy.

765
01:37:21,294 --> 01:37:26,004
You've got a great seat,
just across from the president.

766
01:37:27,383 --> 01:37:31,547
So what is microspan corporation
all about?

767
01:37:31,637 --> 01:37:36,472
I just came to meet the president.
I won't bore you with business.

768
01:37:36,559 --> 01:37:40,552
I don't blame you.
I don't understand high-tech.

769
01:37:40,646 --> 01:37:45,015
I can't wait to introduce you.
Ll ook at this beautiful view.

770
01:37:46,527 --> 01:37:48,267
Yes, very pretty.

771
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:55,192
Give me the list of dinner guests.
Who was the organizer?

772
01:37:55,286 --> 01:38:00,155
Sanford riggs
of the California victory fund.

773
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:05,706
Call LAPD and make sure
they have no uniforms missing.

774
01:38:06,047 --> 01:38:12,543
- It's been taken care of.
- Call the hospital about blood.

775
01:38:13,054 --> 01:38:18,594
Your average American businessman
who looks at a product marketing...

776
01:38:18,684 --> 01:38:24,054
Sees the length and width of it.
The Japanese see the depth.

777
01:38:24,148 --> 01:38:29,893
We plan the next fiscal quarter.
They plan the next quarter century.

778
01:38:29,987 --> 01:38:32,228
Our people don't understand that.

779
01:38:32,323 --> 01:38:37,238
Mr. riggs, can I talk to you?

780
01:38:38,079 --> 01:38:42,072
- Who's that?
- Secret service agent.

781
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:46,413
- Do you know all these people?
- I sure do.

782
01:38:46,504 --> 01:38:52,044
- How about these pictures here?
- I went through all this yesterday.

783
01:38:52,135 --> 01:38:55,969
I'll cooperate, but this is
bordering on harassment.

784
01:38:56,055 --> 01:38:59,513
I'm a harassing kind of guy.

785
01:39:00,268 --> 01:39:02,179
No, no, no, no.

786
01:39:03,604 --> 01:39:05,936
I'll be right back, Mr. carney.

787
01:39:06,357 --> 01:39:08,143
He did what anyone of us would.

788
01:39:08,234 --> 01:39:12,022
He beat up a bellboy on television.
I'd say he was overwrought.

789
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:15,272
We're all overwrought.
Leary's out there someplace.

790
01:39:15,533 --> 01:39:18,616
- You don't think he's a liability?
- No.

791
01:39:18,911 --> 01:39:21,823
Well, you're in the minority.
I want him gone.

792
01:39:21,914 --> 01:39:26,248
- Send him on to San Diego.
- By whose order?

793
01:39:26,335 --> 01:39:30,874
Traveler.
Do you want to tell him or should 1?

794
01:39:30,965 --> 01:39:35,459
Miss Raines, somebody's
approaching traveler's suite.

795
01:40:11,923 --> 01:40:14,756
= z= z=iz = ===: =a =f

796
01:40:16,177 --> 01:40:18,384
what are you doing up here?

797
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:23,639
Seeing what I could do.

798
01:40:25,353 --> 01:40:31,223
Between the LAPD,
the FBI and the rest of us

799
01:40:31,317 --> 01:40:36,778
there are 229 people
protecting traveler tomorrow.

800
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:40,778
A lot of guns.

801
01:40:41,494 --> 01:40:47,034
If leary gets off a shot,
we could be killed in the crossfire.

802
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:51,667
Frank.

803
01:40:53,381 --> 01:40:58,250
Bill watts just called.
Heard about the bellman?

804
01:40:58,344 --> 01:41:01,586
So did traveler.

805
01:41:01,681 --> 01:41:07,551
They want you to go to San Diego
and assist in the advance.

806
01:41:07,645 --> 01:41:11,058
Just like that.

807
01:41:11,357 --> 01:41:16,192
It's not just you against leary.

808
01:41:16,279 --> 01:41:20,739
Have some faith in the rest of us.

809
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:25,743
You know something?

810
01:41:27,999 --> 01:41:32,083
For years I've been listening
to all these idiots

811
01:41:32,169 --> 01:41:37,209
with their pet theories on Dallas.

812
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:41,168
It was the Cubans, or the CIA.

813
01:41:41,262 --> 01:41:44,550
The white supremacists, or the mob.

814
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:50,055
Whether it was one weapon
or whether it was five

815
01:41:51,314 --> 01:41:54,932
none of that meant too much to me.

816
01:41:55,610 --> 01:41:59,728
But leary...

817
01:41:59,822 --> 01:42:04,816
He questioned whether I had the guts
to take that fatal bullet.

818
01:42:07,288 --> 01:42:11,076
God, that was a beautiful day.

819
01:42:13,461 --> 01:42:16,919
The sun was out.

820
01:42:17,632 --> 01:42:20,965
It had been raining all morning.

821
01:42:24,805 --> 01:42:29,674
The first shot
sounded like a firecracker.

822
01:42:29,769 --> 01:42:33,978
I looked over and saw him.
I could tell he was hit.

823
01:42:37,193 --> 01:42:40,560
I don't know why I didn't react.

824
01:42:40,655 --> 01:42:45,365
I should've reacted.
I should've been running.

825
01:42:46,786 --> 01:42:50,278
I just couldn't believe it.

826
01:42:53,793 --> 01:42:58,628
If only I'd reacted,
I could've taken that shot.

827
01:43:03,969 --> 01:43:07,757
It would've been all right with me.

828
01:43:56,397 --> 01:44:00,481
- What's the number in San Diego?
- 619 ukulele.

829
01:44:00,901 --> 01:44:04,689
- Ukulele?
- That's how I remember it.

830
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:09,114
You just push u-k-e-l-e-l-e.

831
01:44:10,578 --> 01:44:16,039
- Ukulele? Isn't that u-k-u?
- I don't know.

832
01:44:16,125 --> 01:44:21,415
But the phone number is u-k-e-l-e-l-e.

833
01:44:29,847 --> 01:44:36,013
U-k-e-ll. Wait a second.

834
01:44:55,456 --> 01:44:56,491
Jesus.

835
01:44:56,749 --> 01:45:01,334
We have an arrival.
Chopper standing by.

836
01:45:15,643 --> 01:45:19,511
Southwest savings, may I help you?
Southwest?

837
01:45:19,605 --> 01:45:25,271
- Yes. May I help you? Hello?
- What's your address?

838
01:45:30,741 --> 01:45:32,948
Taxi!

839
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:41,415
- Post check. Post 37
- In place.

840
01:45:41,502 --> 01:45:44,164
Post 67 - in place.

841
01:45:44,255 --> 01:45:47,042
Post 127 - in place.

842
01:45:53,222 --> 01:45:56,134
Wait right here.

843
01:45:58,102 --> 01:46:01,640
There's no leary in our accounts.

844
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:07,020
Try to imagine him in disguise.
A hat, wigs, that sort of thing.

845
01:46:07,862 --> 01:46:13,528
- I haven't been here long.
- Who was here before you?

846
01:46:13,617 --> 01:46:18,361
Pam Magnus.
“Where can I find her?

847
01:46:20,374 --> 01:46:24,743
She's dead she was murdered.

848
01:46:57,244 --> 01:47:02,159
- She was murdered.
- They won't cancel.

849
01:47:02,249 --> 01:47:06,663
- Then make the arrival underground.
- They want a big show.

850
01:47:06,754 --> 01:47:10,713
- We need proof.
- How about a dead president?

851
01:47:17,348 --> 01:47:21,967
I'm pulling up all the accounts
Pam made,

852
01:47:22,061 --> 01:47:24,347
but it'll take time.

853
01:47:24,438 --> 01:47:27,271
Fax me the list
as soon as you get them.

854
01:47:30,903 --> 01:47:34,020
All agents in position.

855
01:48:38,887 --> 01:48:43,972
- Please step back.
- Empty your pockets.

856
01:48:45,811 --> 01:48:48,894
Thank you.

857
01:49:41,617 --> 01:49:43,153
You're from Texas, right?

858
01:49:51,251 --> 01:49:55,745
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

859
01:50:08,852 --> 01:50:10,092
I'm sorry?

860
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:28,304
Frank! Watts is gonna shit
if he sees youl!

861
01:51:28,390 --> 01:51:33,805
- Have you got a fax for me?
- Yeah, what is it? What's this about?

862
01:51:37,608 --> 01:51:41,521
What the hell is going on, frank?

863
01:51:55,083 --> 01:51:57,699
James carney.

864
01:52:14,394 --> 01:52:16,851
Carney, James.

865
01:52:18,565 --> 01:52:21,853
- Jesus.
- Frank!

866
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:43,913
- What the hell is he doing here?
- I don't know.

867
01:52:44,758 --> 01:52:48,250
- Who gave you permission...
- He's here. His name is carney.

868
01:52:48,345 --> 01:52:53,931
- I want the seating chart.
- Give him the chart

869
01:53:22,587 --> 01:53:25,670
Gun!

870
01:53:38,562 --> 01:53:41,725
Stop! Put the gun down!

871
01:54:04,838 --> 01:54:05,918
(Set down!

872
01:54:12,554 --> 01:54:14,169
Don't shoot!

873
01:54:14,848 --> 01:54:18,056
Get him in the car!

874
01:54:24,107 --> 01:54:25,472
Hold your fire!

875
01:54:33,367 --> 01:54:34,607
Get out of his way!

876
01:54:36,036 --> 01:54:37,947
He's got a hostage!

877
01:54:45,253 --> 01:54:49,963
Raines to shooters.
If you have a shot, take it.

878
01:55:03,313 --> 01:55:04,678
Nice view.

879
01:55:06,316 --> 01:55:12,528
- What's the plan, captain?
- It's your man. You tell me.

880
01:55:12,614 --> 01:55:18,359
Get me sharpshooters
on the north and west towers.

881
01:55:18,453 --> 01:55:21,991
Take the subject out.

882
01:55:38,723 --> 01:55:40,839
You had the guts.
You took the bullet.

883
01:55:42,060 --> 01:55:47,430
- I broke my damn ribs.
- Sorry, I wasn't aiming at you.

884
01:55:47,816 --> 01:55:52,731
Where the hell are the shooters?

885
01:55:52,821 --> 01:55:58,066
- West tower in place. No lights.
- No shot from the north.

886
01:55:58,160 --> 01:56:01,994
A bullet-proof vest
is a bit of a cheat.

887
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:06,744
- Otherwise, you played a good game.
- It's no game, leary.

888
01:56:06,835 --> 01:56:11,499
I was doing my job.
What do we do now?

889
01:56:11,590 --> 01:56:14,502
Do you believe
in the nobility of suicide?

890
01:56:15,552 --> 01:56:16,587
No

891
01:56:16,678 --> 01:56:20,421
But if you want to blow your head off,
be my guest.

892
01:56:20,515 --> 01:56:26,636
Nicely put, but I don't want
to leave this world alone.

893
01:56:27,481 --> 01:56:32,475
- West tower, do you have a shot?
- Negative, too dark. Target unclear.

894
01:56:33,904 --> 01:56:40,616
It's better to die with a friend.
Friend? You're a damn killer!

895
01:56:40,702 --> 01:56:44,695
I saved your life. You owe me.

896
01:56:44,789 --> 01:56:49,954
- I don't owe you shit.
- I was always honest with you.

897
01:56:50,045 --> 01:56:55,256
- Go ahead and shoot.
- It's frank. Quiet!

898
01:56:55,342 --> 01:56:58,584
- Come on.
- Are you talking to me?

899
01:56:58,678 --> 01:57:02,296
- What are you waiting for?
- Waiting for?

900
01:57:02,390 --> 01:57:06,258
I'm waiting for some gratitude.

901
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:11,139
Without me, you're a sad-eyed,
piano-playing drunk.

902
01:57:11,233 --> 01:57:15,146
I brought you into this game.
I let you keep up with me.

903
01:57:15,612 --> 01:57:19,150
- I made you a hero today.
- You didn't make me anything.

904
01:57:19,241 --> 01:57:22,199
I redeemed your pathetic life.

905
01:57:22,452 --> 01:57:25,489
I just did my job.
You're the one with a pathetic life.

906
01:57:25,580 --> 01:57:30,574
- Go ahead and shoot!
- If they fire you'll be hit.

907
01:57:34,839 --> 01:57:36,545
All right, frank.

908
01:57:38,969 --> 01:57:43,712
- All right, frank.
- Stand by to fire on my command.

909
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:49,684
- Sleep well, my friend.
- Just one thing, aim high.

910
01:57:49,771 --> 01:57:52,308
- What?
- Aim high!

911
01:57:52,566 --> 01:57:54,648
Now! You bastard!

912
01:58:46,620 --> 01:58:50,613
Take my hand.
If you don't, you'll die.

913
01:58:50,707 --> 01:58:52,618
You want to save me, frank?

914
01:58:53,543 --> 01:58:58,663
To be honest, no. But it's my job.

915
01:59:04,554 --> 01:59:07,136
Take it

916
02:00:01,820 --> 02:00:05,563
Are you okay?

917
02:00:09,119 --> 02:00:12,282
We've worked with agent horrigan
for some time.

918
02:00:12,372 --> 02:00:17,207
He exemplifies
courage and self-sacrifice. Frank!

919
02:00:17,961 --> 02:00:22,079
I guess I overreacted again, Harry.

920
02:00:41,359 --> 02:00:47,150
Agent horrigan, why are you
retiring from the secret service?

921
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:51,700
Well, I hate desk work and I'm
too old for running around.

922
02:00:51,786 --> 02:00:57,873
And thanks to all this press,
I'm no good for undercover work.

923
02:00:58,835 --> 02:01:04,455
How are you, frank?
The president sent his limo for you.

924
02:01:04,549 --> 02:01:08,588
- That's the least he could do.
- Good. I love public transportation.

925
02:01:12,307 --> 02:01:15,344
Come on in.

926
02:01:16,686 --> 02:01:20,099
Make yourself at home.

927
02:01:31,618 --> 02:01:36,282
- So, what do you think?
- I like it.

928
02:01:36,372 --> 02:01:43,084
Hello, frank. By the time
you hear this, it'll be over.

929
02:01:43,171 --> 02:01:48,541
The president is most likely dead
and so am I.

930
02:01:48,635 --> 02:01:51,502
Frank, did you kill me?

931
02:01:51,596 --> 02:01:56,215
Who won our game?
Not that it matters.

932
02:01:56,309 --> 02:02:00,268
Among friends, like you and me,
it's how you play the game.

933
02:02:00,355 --> 02:02:03,222
The game's done.

934
02:02:03,316 --> 02:02:06,353
It's time to get on with your life.

935
02:02:06,444 --> 02:02:11,529
I worry that
you have no life to get on with.

936
02:02:11,616 --> 02:02:14,824
You're a good man.

937
02:02:14,911 --> 02:02:19,075
Good men, like you and me,
are destined to travel a lonely road.

938
02:02:20,124 --> 02:02:23,332
Goodbye and good luck.

939
02:02:27,340 --> 02:02:32,551
I bet you that brown pigeon
flies off before the white one.

940
02:02:32,637 --> 02:02:35,424
How do you know?

941
02:02:35,682 --> 02:02:40,847
I know things about pigeons, Lilly.
