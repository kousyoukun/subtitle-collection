1
00:01:21,089 --> 00:01:23,523
Oh, my God.

2
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,228
Oh, Frank, thank God.

3
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,733
l'm dead.

4
00:01:37,338 --> 00:01:40,899
Frank, l'm sorry. l got lost.
This town is so confusing.

5
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:43,273
There's Connecticut,
Vermont, Massachusetts--

6
00:01:46,714 --> 00:01:48,739
Man, what a day.

7
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:53,349
My wife had to work early,
so l took my kid to his new school.

8
00:01:53,421 --> 00:01:55,048
He won't stop crying.

9
00:01:55,123 --> 00:01:57,387
Says he wants
to move back to Chicago.

10
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,123
lt broke my heart.

11
00:02:01,195 --> 00:02:02,924
Any more excuses?

12
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,633
Good.

13
00:02:07,702 --> 00:02:09,727
When you work with me,
you be punctual.

14
00:02:09,804 --> 00:02:11,237
You got it?

15
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,165
l'm sorry.
lt won't happen again.

16
00:02:28,623 --> 00:02:30,716
- Come on.
- Frank, how you doing?

17
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:32,953
- Marty.
- Good to see you again.

18
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,129
Sorry we were late.

19
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:39,792
Al, could you go downstairs
and help outJimmy and Raul?

20
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:41,630
- Please?
- Yeah, sure.

21
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,398
- Appreciate it.
- This is his.

22
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,974
Hi, you guys.

23
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:52,502
- You don't trust me.
- l live in a crappy neighborhood.

24
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,514
Yeah?

25
00:02:54,582 --> 00:02:56,880
- Got that funny money?
- Yeah.

26
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,485
Right here.

27
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,881
Looks good.
Looks real good.

28
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,988
- We're in business.
- Excellent.

29
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:13,162
There's just one problem.

30
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:17,830
This guy Al keeps asking me questions
about my counterfeiter.

31
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:21,136
- Really?
- He asked too many questions.

32
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:24,940
My instinct usually tells me
when there's something wrong.

33
00:03:25,012 --> 00:03:27,503
There's something wrong here,
so l had him followed.

34
00:03:31,052 --> 00:03:33,213
He's a fucking Secret Service agent.

35
00:03:49,737 --> 00:03:52,035
What do you think l ought to do?

36
00:03:53,674 --> 00:03:55,938
Make sure the body
doesn't wash up on shore.

37
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,179
l want you to pop him for me.

38
00:04:03,217 --> 00:04:05,378
l think maybe you're with him.

39
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:08,013
You came to me, remember?

40
00:04:09,657 --> 00:04:11,352
So pop him.
Show me l'm an asshole.

41
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,291
l'm just a businessman.

42
00:04:14,362 --> 00:04:16,330
So pop him...

43
00:04:16,397 --> 00:04:18,524
and let's do some business.

44
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:40,249
Yes, that's what
l'm looking for.

45
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:44,653
Let's go get an omelet.
You like omelets?

46
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:47,956
l know a good place.
We'll have chili and cheese.

47
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:49,963
Let me get my pistoli.

48
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:52,898
My gun.

49
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,940
You're under arrest.

50
00:05:10,885 --> 00:05:12,819
You're under arrest too.

51
00:05:12,887 --> 00:05:14,320
Secret Service.

52
00:05:16,724 --> 00:05:20,091
You knew the gun was empty, right?

53
00:05:20,161 --> 00:05:22,186
You knew from the weight
of the gun...

54
00:05:22,263 --> 00:05:25,164
that the chamber was empty?

55
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:28,634
- There could have been one bullet.
- Oh, my God.

56
00:05:36,811 --> 00:05:39,974
Do you think we can go someplace
and talk about this?

57
00:05:50,491 --> 00:05:51,924
You killed guys before?

58
00:05:54,962 --> 00:05:57,726
- Does it get to you?
- lt gets to you.

59
00:06:00,968 --> 00:06:04,631
l don't know if l'm cut out
for this undercover stuff.

60
00:06:04,705 --> 00:06:06,138
l was so scared.

61
00:06:09,677 --> 00:06:12,669
You know, l joined
the Secret Service because...

62
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:18,043
l always wanted
to protect people.

63
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:21,850
The idea of throwing yourself
in front of a gun...

64
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,858
hoping the bullet hits you instead
of the guy you're protecting--

65
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,416
You find that appealing?

66
00:06:29,096 --> 00:06:31,189
l don't know.

67
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,857
Maybe l'm--

68
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,670
Maybe l'm just wrong
for the job.

69
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:41,740
You're a good man.
You'll make a good agent.

70
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,077
How do you know? This is
the longest conversation we ever had.

71
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,607
l know things about people.

72
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:55,882
Come on.
Let's get something to eat.

73
00:06:55,957 --> 00:07:00,553
l want to go home,
hug my wife and kid.

74
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:03,722
A lot of guys warned me
you were a pain in the ass.

75
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,232
And they were right.

76
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,396
- l'll see you in the office.
- Damn. The office.

77
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:14,407
Monroe wanted us
to check out some wacko.

78
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,602
- l'll take care of it.
- l'll go with you.

79
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,413
You go home,
hug your wife and kid.

80
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,546
l am not nosy lady.

81
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:32,752
l don't snoop,
but smoke alarm was going off.

82
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,761
l get scared.

83
00:07:36,931 --> 00:07:40,492
l get more scared when l see
what is there inside.

84
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,239
Smoke was from crumbs
in oven left on.

85
00:08:18,806 --> 00:08:21,900
Thirty-one years
l'm in this country.

86
00:08:21,976 --> 00:08:24,444
l love United States.

87
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:26,309
l go to White House.

88
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,872
Only United States
can just anybody go...

89
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,545
to the house
of the president to visit.

90
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:36,317
So when l see this...

91
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,858
these killing things...

92
00:08:38,926 --> 00:08:40,826
l call police.

93
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,864
They say they call Secret Service.

94
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:46,365
But two days,
you don't come.

95
00:08:49,203 --> 00:08:52,934
The president gets approximately
1 ,400 threats a year, ma'am.

96
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:54,941
We have to check them all.

97
00:09:02,783 --> 00:09:04,614
You say this fellow's name
is McCauley?

98
00:09:04,685 --> 00:09:08,815
No,Joseph McCrawley
from Denver, Colorado.

99
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,757
l still remember like yesterday.

100
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,799
l cry and cry.

101
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,305
Joseph McCrawley of Denver,
right?

102
00:10:02,376 --> 00:10:03,809
That's right.

103
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:07,979
Died over 30 years ago, age 1 1 .

104
00:10:08,048 --> 00:10:10,482
Your guy must have got himself
a duplicate birth certificate...

105
00:10:10,551 --> 00:10:12,610
then used it
to get a driver's license.

106
00:10:16,123 --> 00:10:17,818
- Thanks,Jack.
- See you.

107
00:10:22,229 --> 00:10:23,753
Federal agents.
Open up.

108
00:10:28,903 --> 00:10:30,336
Ma'am.

109
00:11:17,151 --> 00:11:18,584
Oh, my God.

110
00:11:20,821 --> 00:11:22,254
That's you.

111
00:12:31,392 --> 00:12:32,984
Yeah.

112
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,891
Frank Horrigan?

113
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,395
Yeah.

114
00:12:37,564 --> 00:12:39,589
The Secret Service agent?

115
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:41,726
Yeah, what did l win?

116
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,737
My God, it`s really you?

117
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,830
Who the hell is this?

118
00:12:46,907 --> 00:12:50,673
That was you
in my apartment last night.

119
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,051
McCrawley?

120
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:01,053
Why not call me Booth?

121
00:13:02,456 --> 00:13:04,754
Why not Oswald?

122
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,123
Because Booth had flair,
panache--

123
00:13:07,194 --> 00:13:10,254
the leap to the stage
after he shot Lincoln.

124
00:13:14,368 --> 00:13:17,599
- Where are you?
- Closer than you might imagine.

125
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:21,129
lt`s very exciting to talk to you.
l feel like l know you.

126
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,766
How's that?

127
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,777
l`ve read about you,
seen photos.

128
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,939
You wereJFK`s favorite agent,
the best and the brightest.

129
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,108
But that was a long time ago.

130
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,379
What`s kept you in the game
all these years?

131
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:35,786
Why don't we get together for a drink?
We could talk about that.

132
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:39,121
l`d love to, but the less
you know about me the better.

133
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:42,959
- Why?
- l`m planning to kill the president.

134
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,124
You shouldn't have said that.

135
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,293
lt's a federal offense
to threaten the president.

136
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,304
You could go to jail
even if you don't mean it.

137
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,806
l mean it, all right.

138
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,468
John F. Kennedy said
all someone needs is a willingness...

139
00:13:56,543 --> 00:13:58,636
to trade his life
for the president`s.

140
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:02,478
- Right?
- That's right.

141
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:03,982
l`m willing.

142
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,478
Going up against you...

143
00:14:07,554 --> 00:14:10,114
raises the game
to a much higher level.

144
00:14:13,594 --> 00:14:16,825
Fate has brought us together.

145
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,491
l just can`t
get over the irony.

146
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,169
What irony?

147
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,000
You being intimately involved...

148
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,337
with the assassinations
of two presidents.

149
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:37,179
Hang on a second.
l got something on the stove.

150
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,883
He was only in the building
for three weeks.

151
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,714
He came and left at odd hours.

152
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:16,722
What`s really weird is that the other
tenants noticed him on the stairs...

153
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,223
but never really saw him.

154
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:22,228
Depending on who you talk to
he was between 5'8'' and 6'2''...

155
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:26,357
between 1 65 and 1 80 pounds.

156
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:30,062
- Age?
- Between 28 and 45.

157
00:15:39,346 --> 00:15:42,907
Two months before an election,
you get panic on a good day.

158
00:15:44,084 --> 00:15:47,918
- They've been waiting for you.
- Sam.

159
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,582
Been a long time
since you've been over here.

160
00:15:50,657 --> 00:15:53,091
l hear the new director
isn't much fun.

161
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,425
- l've been the director for two years.
- Yeah.

162
00:15:57,664 --> 00:15:59,427
- Al D'Andrea.
- Director.

163
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,127
- You know Matt Wilder?
- Yeah.

164
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:04,261
He still owes me 20 bucks
from Super Bowl XXl.

165
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,101
He always liked Denver.

166
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,607
This is Agent-in-Charge
Bill Watts.

167
00:16:08,675 --> 00:16:10,939
- And Lilly Raines.
- Hello.

168
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,479
Secretaries get prettier
and prettier around here.

169
00:16:13,547 --> 00:16:16,072
And the field agents
get older and older.

170
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,943
Lilly's an agent.

171
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,886
l knew that. l just wanted to see
if she had a sense of humor.

172
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,119
Have a seat.
Let's talk about this guy.

173
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:32,799
- l guess we're calling him Booth?
- Yeah.

174
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:37,826
- What do you know about him?
- Well, he's dangerous.

175
00:16:37,905 --> 00:16:41,432
- How do you know?
- l know things about people.

176
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,307
Why didn't you take
appropriate steps...

177
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,210
to know more that first night?

178
00:16:47,281 --> 00:16:49,545
We had a busy day, Bill.

179
00:16:49,616 --> 00:16:51,311
Too busy to investigate properly?

180
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,149
Your report says you were only
in the room ten minutes.

181
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,654
l didn't have a warrant.

182
00:16:56,823 --> 00:16:59,257
Given your reputation
for undercover work--

183
00:16:59,326 --> 00:17:02,318
- What reputation are you talking about?
- Let's get back on track.

184
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,695
- What's he referring to?
- Let's drop it.

185
00:17:05,766 --> 00:17:08,428
Am l being paranoid
or is he busting my balls?

186
00:17:08,502 --> 00:17:11,062
Probably a little of both.

187
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:17,567
Bill, there was a time around here
when l was almost as arrogant as you.

188
00:17:18,712 --> 00:17:20,339
l don't have time for this.

189
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,645
l have to pull 7 5 agents
out of Miami.

190
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,520
Keep me posted, Sam.

191
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,526
- What do we do with this guy?
- We'll keep investigating.

192
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,122
Meanwhile,
you could have my phone tapped.

193
00:17:39,199 --> 00:17:42,532
- What makes you think he'll call again?
- He'll call again.

194
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,366
He's got panache.

195
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,636
- '' Panache''?
- lt means flamboyance.

196
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:51,872
- l know what it means.
- Really?

197
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:56,109
- l had to look it up.
- We'll tap your phone.

198
00:17:56,183 --> 00:17:58,174
By the way, Frank...

199
00:17:58,251 --> 00:18:02,051
Watts is nowhere near as arrogant
as you were when you had Kennedy's ear.

200
00:18:07,227 --> 00:18:12,028
Just what reputation
was Watts referring to?

201
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:15,091
You know damn well.

202
00:18:15,168 --> 00:18:17,534
ls it because l'm considered
a borderline burnout...

203
00:18:17,604 --> 00:18:20,095
with questionable social skills?

204
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,877
What do you want to talk to me about,
besides your reputation?

205
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,972
l want to be assigned
to the president.

206
00:18:31,685 --> 00:18:34,313
- Protection?
- That's right.

207
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:37,915
After all these years?
Christ, you're a dinosaur.

208
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,959
This guy's gonna make a try,
and l've gotta be there.

209
00:18:40,027 --> 00:18:43,019
- Watts would fight me tooth and nail.
- Then fight him back.

210
00:18:43,096 --> 00:18:46,429
You owe it to me
after 30 years of favors.

211
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,491
lf you knew how many times
l protected your job--

212
00:18:48,568 --> 00:18:51,036
l've got to come back.

213
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:59,941
You really want to stand post again,
at your age?

214
00:19:01,782 --> 00:19:03,443
Yeah.

215
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:07,783
l've got at least one pair
of good shoes in the closet somewhere.

216
00:20:05,946 --> 00:20:09,848
All posts, we're stopping.
Traveler wants to work the ropes.

217
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:13,443
The French president`s going with him.
Get a security man up here.

218
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:36,106
He's coming over here, look!

219
00:20:36,176 --> 00:20:38,269
Goddamn it.

220
00:20:38,345 --> 00:20:40,575
- Mr. President!
- Get back.

221
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,069
- What's going on here?
- Horrigan had a heart attack.

222
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,178
- Pal, you okay?
- Take it easy.

223
00:21:14,247 --> 00:21:18,445
Get the hell out of here.
What the hell's going on?

224
00:21:18,518 --> 00:21:21,419
l got a call
there was a cardiac case.

225
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,218
- You all right?
- Yeah, l'm on my break here.

226
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:27,749
l get it.

227
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,762
You bastards.

228
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,764
Who's the wise guy?

229
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,434
Everybody back to work.

230
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:44,936
All right, who was the joker
who called those guys?

231
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:48,777
lt may not have been a joke.
You were looking peaked out there.

232
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:52,945
l find out who it is,
l'll pay him back in spades.

233
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:55,453
How can you be sure
it was a ''him''?

234
00:22:02,996 --> 00:22:04,861
You missed my street, Al.

235
00:22:04,931 --> 00:22:08,128
Why don't you have a car?

236
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:12,365
l lived in New York a lot of years.
l like public transportation.

237
00:22:12,439 --> 00:22:15,135
You like buses.
That's great.

238
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,835
Why make me go out of my way
every night?

239
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,707
l like your company.

240
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:25,309
He's a weird-looking guy,
isn't he?

241
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,785
Yeah, if he still
looks like that.

242
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,816
Pull up over here.

243
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:40,120
- lt's a weird subculture, Al.
- Yeah.

244
00:23:40,193 --> 00:23:44,391
l'd like you to send some field agents
to check these things...

245
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:45,897
ask about some wackos.

246
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,400
Sure. First thing in the morning,
l`ll get on it.

247
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:51,733
- l`ll talk toJack about it.
- Hang on. l got the other line.

248
00:23:54,574 --> 00:23:55,871
Yeah.

249
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:07,517
- How are you doing?
- l'm fine, thanks.

250
00:24:07,587 --> 00:24:10,420
Hang on a second.
Let me get rid of the other call.

251
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,922
- You got it?
- We got it.

252
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,121
Keep him on the line
till we get the ANl.

253
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:21,934
- Yeah.
- Trying to trace me?

254
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,664
Why didn't l think of that?

255
00:24:24,738 --> 00:24:29,107
You did or you're not
the adversary l'd hoped for.

256
00:24:29,175 --> 00:24:32,406
Speaking of which, how are you?
l was worried about you today.

257
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,044
- Why?
- ln the motorcade--

258
00:24:36,116 --> 00:24:38,277
l thought you were
gonna pass out.

259
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:43,622
You should get in shape
for that kind of duty.

260
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,624
Yeah, maybe you`re right.

261
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:50,459
By the way,
l'm watching your movie.

262
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,623
Movie?

263
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:57,864
November, 1 963. Kennedy`s last days,
the arrival in Texas.

264
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,137
lt must have been
exciting for you.

265
00:25:04,144 --> 00:25:07,204
Dallas,
that morning at Love Field.

266
00:25:09,482 --> 00:25:11,643
You all look so radiant:

267
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,983
JFK,Jackie and you.

268
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,319
You look so young and able.

269
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,653
What did happen to you that day?

270
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:24,822
Only one agent reacted
to the gunfire...

271
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,890
and you were closer
to Kennedy than he was.

272
00:25:27,967 --> 00:25:31,494
You must have looked up at the window
of the Texas Book Depository...

273
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,937
but you didn`t react.

274
00:25:34,007 --> 00:25:37,033
Late at night,
when the demons come...

275
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:42,006
do you see the rifle
coming out of that window...

276
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,607
or do you see Kennedy`s head
being blown apart?

277
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,850
lf you`d reacted
to that first shot...

278
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:52,517
could you have gotten there
in time to stop the big bullet?

279
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:57,689
lf you had, that could have been
your head being blown apart.

280
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:03,536
Do you wish you`d succeeded
or is life too precious?

281
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,736
What's done is done.

282
00:26:07,807 --> 00:26:12,210
l have that '' Esquire'' magazine article
on the tenth anniversary...

283
00:26:12,278 --> 00:26:16,044
about you and all the other agents
that were there that day.

284
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:21,850
So sad how your wife left you
and took your little daughter.

285
00:26:21,921 --> 00:26:26,051
You were so forthright
about your drinking problem...

286
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:29,323
and the fact that
you weren`t easy to live with.

287
00:26:29,395 --> 00:26:33,525
l was so moved by your honesty.

288
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,228
The world can be
a cruel place...

289
00:26:36,302 --> 00:26:38,896
to an honest man.

290
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:42,999
What about you, Booth?
What's your story?

291
00:26:43,076 --> 00:26:45,909
lt's an epic saga.

292
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,745
l'll talk to you again soon.

293
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,375
Nice to have a friend.

294
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:02,552
- Did you get him?
- We got him.

295
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,935
Go!

296
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,099
Get on the floor!

297
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:21,472
Get your hands
where l can see them!

298
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:26,448
He could have a device
that manipulates the ANl...

299
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,953
and fakes the line's identification.

300
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,115
Makes it seem like
he's calling from another number.

301
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,625
Where would he get this device?

302
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:36,321
He could build one if he were
knowledgeable in digital circuitry.

303
00:27:36,396 --> 00:27:39,126
- But you can't trace the call.
- You can run a parity check.

304
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,360
lf his line is wired
for digital switches.

305
00:27:41,434 --> 00:27:42,867
You can trace the call?

306
00:27:42,936 --> 00:27:46,531
Not if it's an old,
twisted-pair, analog line.

307
00:27:46,606 --> 00:27:48,631
Damn it,Jack,
give a straight answer...

308
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,142
or my partner
will shoot off his foot.

309
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,237
He calls again,
you keep him on the line.

310
00:27:54,314 --> 00:27:58,148
We'll see what we can do.
Right, Tony?

311
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:02,985
You might suggest to the police that
they don't knock down any more doors.

312
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,383
l'm intrigued,
but why play it for me?

313
00:28:34,454 --> 00:28:37,617
We'd like you to consider canceling
the president's dinner tomorrow.

314
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,693
The state dinner,
at the French embassy?

315
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:45,595
Do you know how long it took to line up
this trip this close to the election?

316
00:28:45,665 --> 00:28:48,190
This guy's manipulated
the phone system.

317
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,759
lf he has a knowledge of explosives,
there could be problems.

318
00:28:50,837 --> 00:28:52,896
Do your job,
there won't be any problems.

319
00:28:52,972 --> 00:28:55,532
lt's not that hard to smuggle weapons
inside an embassy.

320
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:59,977
You think the French want to knock off
the president? Are you nuts?

321
00:29:00,046 --> 00:29:02,879
- They love him.
- Why does every chief of staff--

322
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,543
You have no reason to believe
this guy is any more dangerous...

323
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:08,052
than thousands of others
who make idle threats...

324
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,613
but you want me to alter the itinerary
of the world's most powerful man...

325
00:29:11,691 --> 00:29:13,659
and risk offending
40 million French.

326
00:29:13,726 --> 00:29:17,218
lsn't it possible this guy
has pushed some buttons in you?

327
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:20,061
Maybe you're overreacting a little.

328
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,601
l'm just trying
to protect your boss, damn it.

329
00:29:22,669 --> 00:29:26,400
So am l. We're trailing 1 2 points
in the latest polls.

330
00:29:26,472 --> 00:29:29,305
He could be out of a job
in six weeks.

331
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:32,344
- He's got to be seen.
- Even if it kills him?

332
00:29:32,412 --> 00:29:34,346
Next order of business?

333
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:40,246
How could being a dozen points down
look like good news?

334
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,914
The president
was even worse off weeks ago.

335
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:45,924
His aides will keep him out
with the voters as much as they can...

336
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,425
especially in the midwest.

337
00:29:47,493 --> 00:29:49,984
Then an all-important swing
through California.

338
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,322
Ladies and gentlemen...

339
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,130
the President and the First Lady
of the United States...

340
00:29:57,203 --> 00:30:00,764
and His Excellency,
the President of France, and his wife.

341
00:30:43,416 --> 00:30:46,943
- Agent Raines, you look devastating.
- Thank you.

342
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:50,614
Good enough to eat, l might add,
if you'll pardon the expression.

343
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,653
Every time l start
to sympathize with you...

344
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:58,094
you say something
that really annoys me.

345
00:30:58,164 --> 00:31:00,029
Why sympathize?

346
00:31:01,434 --> 00:31:04,562
The tape of that phone call,
when he mentioned your wife.

347
00:31:04,637 --> 00:31:06,264
Ex-wife.

348
00:31:07,573 --> 00:31:09,006
At any rate, l'm sorry.

349
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:12,511
lt's strange that the only sympathy
l get these days...

350
00:31:12,578 --> 00:31:15,638
is from a would-be assassin
or a woman l tend to annoy.

351
00:31:15,715 --> 00:31:17,273
Would you care to dance?

352
00:31:18,518 --> 00:31:20,008
Perhaps some other time.

353
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,020
l get off in a couple hours.

354
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:25,785
What are you looking at?

355
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,127
l was wondering
where you hide your firearm.

356
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:34,131
Don't tell me.
Let me guess.

357
00:31:41,607 --> 00:31:44,303
We`re on final approach
to Los Angeles.

358
00:31:44,377 --> 00:31:48,837
The temperature is a balmy 76 degrees.
lt`s a beautiful day out there.

359
00:31:48,915 --> 00:31:52,715
Thanks for flying with us.
We look forward to seeing you again.

360
00:32:10,636 --> 00:32:13,400
l'd like to deposit this
in the new account.

361
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,735
l'll need to see
your corporate resolutions.

362
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:25,409
Microspan Corporation.

363
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,579
- What kind of business are you in?
- Software.

364
00:32:28,654 --> 00:32:30,918
- Up in San Jose.
- Yes.

365
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:34,926
Based there, but l'm opening
an office here in Los Angeles.

366
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:37,258
l like San Jose.

367
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,924
- Are you from there?
- No.

368
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,627
- Where are you from?
- Minneapolis.

369
00:32:42,702 --> 00:32:45,500
You're kidding.
So am l.

370
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:49,774
Wow, it's a small world.

371
00:32:51,777 --> 00:32:53,210
l hated the winters.

372
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,770
Nine months of the year
l'd stay indoors and pig out.

373
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,442
l moved here and have lost
30 pounds so far.

374
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:02,921
- What high school did you go to?
- New Brighton High School.

375
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,415
There isn't any
New Brighton High School.

376
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:11,520
There was when l was there.

377
00:33:11,597 --> 00:33:13,792
Maybe l'm just confused.

378
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,857
lt happens a lot.

379
00:33:15,935 --> 00:33:19,132
What was the name of that high school
on Third just across from--

380
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:22,606
l'm sorry, but l'm very late
for a meeting. Will this take long?

381
00:33:22,675 --> 00:33:25,803
Not at all.
Just another minute.

382
00:33:28,114 --> 00:33:29,638
Thank you.

383
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,485
You have a very pleasant way
about you.

384
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,326
Thank you, Mr. Carney.

385
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:57,873
Agent Raines, how would you like
to give a colleague a ride home?

386
00:33:57,944 --> 00:34:00,003
Why do you keep flirting with me?

387
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,343
Am l flirting with you?

388
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:05,009
You know it can't possibly go anywhere,
so why keep doing it?

389
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:08,019
Maybe it's because l know
it can't possibly go anywhere.

390
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:10,112
Give me a lift.
l'll buy you an ice cream.

391
00:34:10,189 --> 00:34:11,622
No further obligations.

392
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:14,992
Oh, boy.

393
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,757
l`ve never worked
with a female agent before.

394
00:34:18,831 --> 00:34:22,790
- How many are there?
- About 1 25.

395
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:27,372
- Pure window dressing.
- Excuse me?

396
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,701
Window dressing.

397
00:34:30,776 --> 00:34:34,212
About 1 25
out of a little over 2,000.

398
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,544
They have you all around
so the president can look good...

399
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,277
to his feminist voters.

400
00:34:39,785 --> 00:34:42,948
Do you make an effort
to be obnoxious or is it a gift?

401
00:34:43,022 --> 00:34:44,819
lt's a gift.

402
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:48,053
Half the things we do
are window dressing.

403
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,220
Take running alongside
that limousine.

404
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:53,322
lt'd take an antitank missile
to put a dent in that damn thing.

405
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:54,889
There we are out for show...

406
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,902
trying to make the president
look more presidential.

407
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,073
lf l'm here to court
the feminist vote...

408
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,507
what demographics
do you represent?

409
00:35:05,578 --> 00:35:07,011
Let's see.

410
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:10,879
White, piano-playing heterosexuals
over the age of 50.

411
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:15,080
There ain't a whole lot of us,
but we do have a powerful lobby.

412
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:22,692
Well, time flies
when you're being annoyed.

413
00:35:22,762 --> 00:35:25,322
- Where are you going?
- l have a date.

414
00:35:25,398 --> 00:35:28,925
- With whom?
- That's none of your business.

415
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,436
You want a ride?

416
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,268
l don't think so.

417
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,275
l like it here this time of day.
l'll hang out.

418
00:35:40,046 --> 00:35:43,447
Thanks for the ice cream.
See you.

419
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,949
You're welcome.

420
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:58,758
lf she looks back,
that means she's interested.

421
00:35:59,865 --> 00:36:02,197
Come on now,
give me a little look.

422
00:36:02,268 --> 00:36:04,463
One little glance back.

423
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,802
Give me that smug look
and be on your way.

424
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,149
Well, Abe--

425
00:36:19,418 --> 00:36:23,218
Damn, l wish l could have
been there for you, pal.

426
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:33,657
Hi, baby.
How are you doing?

427
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,827
Come on up here. Give me a kiss.
That's a good boy.

428
00:36:36,902 --> 00:36:38,995
Yes, l missed you too.

429
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:45,673
l'm sorry.
l didn't mean to startle you.

430
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:50,239
-l got your address from the phone book.
-But l'm not listed.

431
00:36:50,316 --> 00:36:56,186
Uh-oh.
l suppose l better come clean.

432
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:58,223
l followed you.

433
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:00,758
l'm sorry.
l'm not very good at this.

434
00:37:00,826 --> 00:37:03,056
l'm new in town.

435
00:37:03,129 --> 00:37:07,589
l was wondering if you would care
to join me for dinner tonight.

436
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,703
That's very sweet, but l--

437
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:15,207
And l also wanted to apologize
for lying to you this afternoon.

438
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,174
We both know
l'm not from Minneapolis.

439
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,703
l shouldn't ask so many questions.

440
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,374
Did you mention
our conversation...

441
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:27,283
to anyone at the bank
this afternoon?

442
00:37:27,353 --> 00:37:29,548
May l?

443
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,225
Rory, settle down!

444
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,392
Pam, what's going on?
Hi.

445
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,962
This is my roommate.
Sally, this is Mr. Carney.

446
00:37:43,035 --> 00:37:44,798
Call meJim.
How do you do?

447
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:48,636
Nice to meet you.
l was just on my way out.

448
00:37:48,707 --> 00:37:52,575
l'm afraid l can't let you ladies
leave this evening.

449
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,738
What?

450
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,078
You shouldn't have been
from Minneapolis.

451
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,918
Look, l don't know
what you want, but--

452
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:24,108
- Hi, this is Sally.
-And this is Pam.

453
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,610
We`re either out having fun
or we`re asleep.

454
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,443
So leave your name and number
and we`ll call you back.

455
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:30,948
Bye.

456
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:43,454
Frank, l hope you don`t mind me
calling you at the office.

457
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,622
l was in the neighborhood.

458
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,495
No, why don`t you drop by?

459
00:38:47,566 --> 00:38:49,295
l`d love to.

460
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:54,305
Let me take some time to welcome
those who are joining us late.

461
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,603
l`d love to drop by.
l`d like it a lot.

462
00:38:56,675 --> 00:38:58,802
We`ve got so much in common.

463
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:02,041
We do? Like what?

464
00:39:02,114 --> 00:39:05,140
We`re both willing to trade
our lives for the president.

465
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:07,515
We`re both honest
and capable men...

466
00:39:07,586 --> 00:39:10,054
who were betrayed
by people we trusted.

467
00:39:10,122 --> 00:39:13,819
- l wasn't betrayed, Booth.
- Sure you were.

468
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,487
The Warren Commission`s report
on the assassination--

469
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:19,395
They called your procedure
''seriously deficient. ''

470
00:39:19,465 --> 00:39:21,831
They criticized you
and the other agents...

471
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,495
who were out drinking late
the night before...

472
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:28,165
as though Kennedy would be alive today
if you`d been in bed at 10:00 p.m.

473
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,832
That`s ludicrous.

474
00:39:33,012 --> 00:39:34,673
Maybe they were right.

475
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:37,511
As a matter of fact,
they weren`t right.

476
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:41,679
You wanted to station agents
on his bumpers and sideboards.

477
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,518
He refused. Do you know why
l think he refused?

478
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:48,526
l think he refused
because he had a death wish.

479
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,892
He talked all the time
about being assassinated.

480
00:39:50,963 --> 00:39:53,693
His favorite poem was
''l Have a Rendezvous with Death''...

481
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:57,361
which is not a good poem.

482
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,370
l think he wanted to die.

483
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:03,033
l think he didn`t care that his death
would ruin your life.

484
00:40:03,108 --> 00:40:05,542
l think he was a selfish bastard.

485
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:10,146
But what do you think?

486
00:40:14,553 --> 00:40:18,614
What about you?
Who betrayed you?

487
00:40:18,691 --> 00:40:20,158
l don't think he's scrambling it.

488
00:40:20,225 --> 00:40:23,058
Some of the same people.

489
00:40:23,128 --> 00:40:28,031
But l`m gonna get even.
l`ll have my day in the sun.

490
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,402
The questions is:
Will you have yours?

491
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:35,907
- lt's coming.
- You`re in for a lot more pain.

492
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,239
How much of this shit
do l have to listen to?

493
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,572
Jesus!

494
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,210
He's right across the street:
Lafayette Park. Keep him on.

495
00:41:02,968 --> 00:41:04,435
Are you guys crazy?

496
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:21,251
Do you see somebody over there?

497
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:27,188
l told you to get in shape.

498
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:39,967
This is your current address?

499
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:43,975
And you didn't see anybody suspicious
hanging around that phone booth?

500
00:41:52,418 --> 00:41:53,817
That's him.

501
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:33,187
Secret Service.
l'm impounding this car.

502
00:42:33,258 --> 00:42:39,026
He put his hand down here.
We got fingerprints.

503
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,658
You all right?

504
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,316
- Tony.
- Yeah?

505
00:43:34,386 --> 00:43:36,251
Have a look at this.

506
00:43:36,321 --> 00:43:39,256
- This the print from Secret Service?
- Yeah.

507
00:43:39,324 --> 00:43:41,224
Something strange here.

508
00:43:41,293 --> 00:43:45,024
Shit. lt's a C-1 2.
We can't tell them.

509
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:54,772
- l'm afraid that we've drawn a blank.
- You sure?

510
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,775
We ran that print
against everything we've got.

511
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:06,611
What do we do now?

512
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,778
l'm leaving with the president
in the morning.

513
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:11,948
- You keep investigating.
- What should l do?

514
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:15,391
You're an adult human being.
Think of something.

515
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:18,452
You're a real pain in the ass
when things don't go your way.

516
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,122
Your friends warned you about that.

517
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,184
The president
hit the campaign trail today.

518
00:44:39,251 --> 00:44:41,242
He left
from Andrews Air Force Base...

519
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:45,188
on a whirlwind tour of 1 2 states
over the next six days.

520
00:44:45,257 --> 00:44:47,589
With just over a month to go
before the election...

521
00:44:47,659 --> 00:44:50,651
the president is trailing
his opponent by ten points.

522
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:54,165
To close that gap, he`ll concentrate
his campaign efforts in the midwest...

523
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,996
where he`s sagging in the polls.

524
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:59,469
The campaign swing will wind up
in Chicago with a big rally.

525
00:44:59,538 --> 00:45:03,167
The president`s campaign staff
is hopeful that by that time--

526
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,176
Reservations, Donna Lynn.
May l help you?

527
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:08,179
l'm calling to find out when
you would have a flight on Tuesday...

528
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:11,182
from Washington to Los Angeles?

529
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,683
All right.

530
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:15,185
lf possible, l'd like to get
an open-ended ticket...

531
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:19,213
because l may have to make some stops
in the midwest on my return.

532
00:45:19,291 --> 00:45:21,191
Denver Command Post, C-5 Agents.

533
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,854
We`ll off-load the choppers first.
Who`s our route agent?

534
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,292
C-5 Agent,
that will beJack McKeen.

535
00:45:27,366 --> 00:45:31,769
Denver Command Post, Watts.
We have arrival: 1315.

536
00:45:31,837 --> 00:45:35,705
C-5 Agent, where are we keeping
these cars secured?

537
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:39,039
Denver Police Department
has a fenced area for us.

538
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:42,205
Security Room, Watts.
We`re ten minutes out. Situation report.

539
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:46,547
Here in Denver, we gathe today
in the shadow of giants:

540
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:50,384
brave pioneers who overcame
terrifying obstacles...

541
00:45:50,455 --> 00:45:53,515
to carve a new nation
from a wilderness.

542
00:45:53,592 --> 00:45:58,962
Today we are asked to match
our vision to their vision...

543
00:45:59,031 --> 00:46:02,899
and to pass that legacy
of a boundless--

544
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,562
Horrigan to l D.
Sector three secured?

545
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,662
Sector three is secure.

546
00:46:07,739 --> 00:46:10,003
A legacy of tolerance--

547
00:46:10,075 --> 00:46:12,009
The president campaigning today
in Denver.

548
00:46:12,077 --> 00:46:16,571
Here in Washington this afternoon,
the Senate again delayed action--

549
00:46:25,557 --> 00:46:29,516
We are living in a time
of global economic transition.

550
00:46:29,594 --> 00:46:34,793
We need compassion and vision
to create a future...

551
00:46:34,866 --> 00:46:38,996
of peace and progress
for every American.

552
00:46:39,071 --> 00:46:42,268
That was the president
stumping in Nebraska today.

553
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:45,105
He`s due to arrive here in Los Angeles
later in the month...

554
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:48,908
to compete for California`s crucial
54 electoral votes.

555
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:10,793
Hi, Sandy Riggs calling
forJames Carney.

556
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:13,633
lf you`re serious
about trying to catch a rally...

557
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:16,469
while you`re in the midwest,
you best call me.

558
00:47:16,541 --> 00:47:19,806
The president`s schedule changes
hour by hour.

559
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:21,641
ln answer
to your other question...

560
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:24,307
just send a check here
to party headquarters.

561
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:27,216
Thanks again.
l`m looking forward to meeting you.

562
00:47:27,285 --> 00:47:29,810
Ladies and gentlemen
of Holland, Michigan...

563
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:32,652
the President
of the United States!

564
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,155
We`ve gone a long way
toward achieving that goal...

565
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,165
but there's a lot left to do.

566
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,497
Watts, Flynn. We got some trouble
on the tracks up ahead.

567
00:47:43,568 --> 00:47:45,661
You better notify
the White House staff.

568
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:50,174
Milwaukee will be easy tomorrow.
We`ve only got one site.

569
00:47:55,213 --> 00:47:57,511
May l have your attention, please?

570
00:47:57,582 --> 00:48:01,848
Flight 3 1 8 to Milwaukee
is now boarding at Gate 2 1.

571
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,013
Please have
your boarding passes ready.

572
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:08,082
All passengers should proceed
to the boarding area now.

573
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,199
Checking.

574
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:19,203
Found any bombs today?

575
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:27,036
- Agent Raines.
- Agent Horrigan.

576
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:29,706
How's the first lady?
Did she ask about me?

577
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,544
Have you gotten to know them yet?

578
00:48:31,616 --> 00:48:34,551
l prefer not to get to know
the people l'm protecting.

579
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:36,211
Why is that?

580
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:39,086
You might decide they're
not worth taking a bullet for.

581
00:48:39,157 --> 00:48:41,284
Here comes my replacement.

582
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:44,726
- Care to join me in the bar?
- We can't drink on the road.

583
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:47,560
Of course not, but they've got
a hell of a piano player.

584
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:59,569
l've played for presidents,
and l've played with presidents.

585
00:48:59,644 --> 00:49:03,910
Nixon and l once did
a halfway decent duet of'' Moonglow.''

586
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:05,847
l heard he didn't like you.

587
00:49:05,917 --> 00:49:08,909
That's not true.
We got on all right.

588
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:11,922
His chief of staff
was another matter.

589
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,582
Once at a rally in Boston....

590
00:49:13,658 --> 00:49:16,923
he ordered me to get rid
of some antiwar protesters.

591
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:21,694
l said l couldn't do that.
Freedom of speech, that kind of stuff.

592
00:49:21,766 --> 00:49:25,429
He said, ''When l'm talking to you,
l am the president.''

593
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:30,271
And l said, ''You look more like
a sack of shit in a cheap suit, sir.''

594
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,876
l like the ''sir.''
lt's a classy touch.

595
00:49:33,945 --> 00:49:36,106
- l thought so.
- Mm-hmm.

596
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,385
So how come you never wear shades
standing post?

597
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:56,459
l like the wackos to see
the whites of my eyes.

598
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,969
A good glare can be
just as effective as a gun.

599
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:01,471
- Know what l mean?
- Yeah.

600
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,044
You got me.

601
00:50:17,122 --> 00:50:20,319
You better stick
to the shades, sweetheart.

602
00:50:37,108 --> 00:50:40,271
Agent Raines,
what are you afraid of?

603
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:43,981
Afraid of making a big mistake.

604
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,351
Good night.

605
00:51:36,401 --> 00:51:38,369
We're looking at this route
to the hospital--

606
00:51:47,045 --> 00:51:48,535
Oh, good.

607
00:51:48,613 --> 00:51:51,081
We've got some updates
on Milwaukee tomorrow.

608
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:52,582
Thanks.

609
00:51:56,855 --> 00:51:59,619
Call Advance and see
if we can get a backup route.

610
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:45,969
- Don't answer it.
- Shit.

611
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:55,809
Traveler`s lost ground in Georgia,
so Milwaukee`s off.

612
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:59,646
They`re staging a rally outside Atlanta
in a town called Woodstock.

613
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:02,482
We need you down at Communications,
right away.

614
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:04,488
l'll be right down.

615
00:53:09,894 --> 00:53:14,991
Traveler's losing ground in Georgia,
so Milwaukee's out tomorrow.

616
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:18,832
And they're staging a rally
somewhere outside Atlanta.

617
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:25,334
Damn.

618
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,843
Oh, dear.

619
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:32,174
What am l doing?

620
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,184
Shit. Ow.

621
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:37,854
Oh, boy.

622
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,524
Damn.

623
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:48,498
l gotta put all that shit back on,
goddamn it.

624
00:53:54,005 --> 00:53:56,200
Please open your purses
for inspection.

625
00:53:56,274 --> 00:54:00,608
You don`t know how glad l am to see you
all out in the rain with me today.

626
00:54:00,678 --> 00:54:03,545
l've been going around saying...

627
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:06,709
'' Don't just vote for me,
join me.''

628
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:09,686
Today you certainly have.

629
00:54:09,754 --> 00:54:12,780
We may feel a tad damp today...

630
00:54:12,857 --> 00:54:17,055
but guess who`s going to be all wet
on election day?

631
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:28,571
What about the watch list?

632
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,904
l've got 23 regional crazies
under surveillance.

633
00:54:30,975 --> 00:54:33,068
Chicago intelligence has nine more.

634
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,736
- The hospital?
- St. Ann's.

635
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:37,577
Extra units ofTraveler's
blood type on hand.

636
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:40,584
Accessible to that
alternative route as well.

637
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,916
ETA Chicago: Ten minutes.

638
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,923
- Under the weather?
- Sick as a dog.

639
00:54:53,998 --> 00:54:57,456
Yeah? What's this?

640
00:54:57,535 --> 00:55:00,197
'' Psychological Profile
ofJohn Booth.''

641
00:55:00,271 --> 00:55:03,934
- Did you make a mistake?
- What?

642
00:55:04,008 --> 00:55:07,466
You said you were afraid
of making a big mistake.

643
00:55:13,017 --> 00:55:17,784
Let's be realistic. This job
is not like we work in a bank.

644
00:55:19,023 --> 00:55:22,288
You had an affair with an agent,
and it came out badly.

645
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,294
He wasn't an agent.

646
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:28,059
He left you because you wouldn't quit.
You were brokenhearted.

647
00:55:28,132 --> 00:55:33,092
l left him because l wouldn't
quit my job for him.

648
00:55:33,171 --> 00:55:35,105
lt did break my heart.

649
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:40,807
You vowed to never let a man
come between you and your career.

650
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:48,084
Except now you're in love with me,
and it scares you a little.

651
00:55:48,152 --> 00:55:50,985
Blow your nose. Here.

652
00:55:51,055 --> 00:55:52,488
Sorry.

653
00:55:56,461 --> 00:56:00,329
What were to happen
if l gave up my job for you?

654
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:08,470
Why would you do that?

655
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:12,008
Maybe l vowed
to never let my career...

656
00:56:12,076 --> 00:56:13,566
come between me and a woman.

657
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:28,021
- Yeah?
- Be careful, will you?

658
00:56:28,092 --> 00:56:32,188
This whole event tonight has been
advertised in advance.Just be alert.

659
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:48,702
This is Horrigan.
lt's a zoo out here.

660
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,806
lt's not very secure.
We've got to take Traveler underground.

661
00:56:51,883 --> 00:56:53,874
All posts, this is Watts.

662
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:57,285
We`re using the alternate
arrival site: underground.

663
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:14,397
Horrigan to Watts.
l think Booth may be here.

664
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:16,906
l thought
you couldn`t identify him.

665
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,909
l can't.
Just call it a hunch.

666
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:22,572
With all due respect to your psychic
abilities, we`ll stick to the game plan.

667
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:24,581
All posts, take your positions.

668
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:29,582
- You've got a fever.
-Just stay alert in there.

669
00:57:36,427 --> 00:57:40,727
There is one quality above all
that marks this president.

670
00:57:40,798 --> 00:57:44,529
lt has earned him the affection
of every working man and woman.

671
00:57:44,602 --> 00:57:48,595
- Give us our president!
- That quality is courage!

672
00:57:50,742 --> 00:57:53,267
The question to us is:

673
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:55,938
Will we stand by the man...

674
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:58,778
who has stood by us?

675
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:02,251
- Post check. Stage right?
- Stage right all clear.

676
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,982
- Stage left?
- Stage left clear.

677
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:09,789
- Stage center?
- Stage center clear.

678
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:14,298
- Mezzanine left?
- Mezzanine left all clear.

679
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:17,630
The President of the United States
and the First Lady.

680
00:58:56,707 --> 00:58:58,504
Gun!

681
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:00,237
Get down!

682
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,949
Get these people
out of here!

683
00:59:08,019 --> 00:59:10,681
Hold all radio traffic.

684
00:59:14,225 --> 00:59:17,422
Security room.
What the hell`s going on in there?

685
00:59:20,231 --> 00:59:22,791
l'm all clear.

686
00:59:22,867 --> 00:59:24,391
False alarm.

687
00:59:24,469 --> 00:59:28,132
Traveler's secure.
All posts resume positions.

688
00:59:28,206 --> 00:59:29,935
- You all right, Mr. President?
- l'm all right.

689
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:35,871
Everything's all right, folks.
Everything will be just fine.

690
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:38,711
We had a little false alarm there.

691
00:59:41,319 --> 00:59:42,843
Wasn't that exciting?

692
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:45,889
Take your seats, please,
ladies and gentlemen.

693
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:48,823
Security Room, Raines.

694
00:59:48,893 --> 00:59:50,554
lt was just a balloon popping.
All clear.

695
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:52,562
Traveler wants to continue.

696
01:00:15,286 --> 01:00:19,120
Do you have any idea
how many votes you cost us last night?

697
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:22,523
The president came off looking
like a coward on national television.

698
01:00:22,593 --> 01:00:24,254
He came off all right.

699
01:00:24,328 --> 01:00:26,262
You were the one that
looked like the damn coward.

700
01:00:27,231 --> 01:00:28,664
This is a joke to you?

701
01:00:28,733 --> 01:00:31,133
No, you're a joke to me, Harry.

702
01:00:31,202 --> 01:00:33,864
- You have no idea what we do here.
- That's enough!

703
01:00:33,938 --> 01:00:37,601
You call me Harry again, you'll be
busting counterfeiters in Alaska.

704
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:39,973
You keep him away from the president,
away from the White House...

705
01:00:40,044 --> 01:00:43,013
and you sure better
keep him away from me!

706
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:45,446
You don't talk
to the chief of staff like that!

707
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:49,976
- l don't work for him.
- No, you work for me. You did.

708
01:00:51,322 --> 01:00:52,789
You're off my detail.

709
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:03,463
My Super Bowl debt.

710
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:05,502
ln case l don't see you
after this trip.

711
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:19,479
You know, if you were just
to acknowledge...

712
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,643
that it was
an unfortunate situation--

713
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:23,778
l won't apologize
for doing my job.

714
01:01:23,854 --> 01:01:26,152
l'm not saying you should...

715
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:28,658
but the president was humiliated.

716
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,318
He's alive, isn't he?

717
01:01:30,394 --> 01:01:32,988
We're here to safeguard
his dignity as well.

718
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:34,588
l'm not paid for that.

719
01:01:34,665 --> 01:01:38,260
What about the time Kennedy's girlfriend
was caught in the White House...

720
01:01:38,336 --> 01:01:40,566
and you said she was with you?

721
01:01:43,474 --> 01:01:45,567
Don't believe every rumor
someone tells you.

722
01:01:45,643 --> 01:01:48,771
Wilder told me
the whole story...

723
01:01:48,846 --> 01:01:51,644
about how you were
suspended a month without pay.

724
01:01:51,716 --> 01:01:54,150
l'd say that was
safeguarding his dignity.

725
01:01:54,218 --> 01:01:56,914
That was different.
He was different.

726
01:01:56,988 --> 01:01:58,751
Maybe you were different.

727
01:01:58,823 --> 01:02:00,290
l was different.

728
01:02:00,358 --> 01:02:02,826
The whole damn country was different.

729
01:02:02,893 --> 01:02:04,485
Everything would be different
right now too...

730
01:02:04,562 --> 01:02:06,894
if l'd been half as paranoid
as l am today.

731
01:02:06,964 --> 01:02:08,397
Fuck.

732
01:02:29,387 --> 01:02:32,618
Why not just retire, Frank?

733
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:34,248
Live off your pension.

734
01:02:34,325 --> 01:02:36,054
l mean, what's the point?

735
01:02:39,263 --> 01:02:41,231
Somebody else asked me that
not long ago.

736
01:02:42,533 --> 01:02:45,866
Hell, you don't spend any money
on anything except jazz records.

737
01:02:45,936 --> 01:02:48,234
l want to stay
on the Booth case.

738
01:02:52,476 --> 01:02:53,909
All right.

739
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:57,379
- As for protective detail, l can't--
- l understand.

740
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:08,781
That thing in Chicago--
l just don't understand.

741
01:03:08,859 --> 01:03:11,555
l've never been on the wrong side
of a judgment call like that.

742
01:03:11,629 --> 01:03:14,063
You had the flu,
for Christ's sake.

743
01:03:14,131 --> 01:03:16,565
lt's been known
to impair judgment.

744
01:03:17,835 --> 01:03:19,769
Face it.

745
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:21,498
You're too old for this shit.

746
01:04:18,696 --> 01:04:22,359
- Hello.
- What happened in the Windy City?

747
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:29,002
The balloon get you
in a little panic?

748
01:04:31,942 --> 01:04:34,604
- You were there?
- Yes, l was.

749
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:38,842
Watching the president,
l couldn't help wondering...

750
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:42,579
why a man like you would risk his life
to save a man like that.

751
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:45,813
You have such a strange job.

752
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:48,950
l can't decide
if it's heroic or absurd.

753
01:04:49,026 --> 01:04:53,929
Why would a man like you
risk his life to kill a man like that?

754
01:04:53,998 --> 01:04:57,297
Don`t you have a psychological profile
on me yet?

755
01:04:57,368 --> 01:04:59,302
l don't put a lot of stock in them.

756
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:00,860
Nor do l.

757
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:04,374
A man's actions don't equal the sum
of his psychological parts.

758
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:07,309
- Doesn`t work that way.
-Just how does it work?

759
01:05:12,383 --> 01:05:14,715
lt doesn't work.

760
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:18,414
God doesn't punish the wicked
and reward the righteous.

761
01:05:18,489 --> 01:05:19,004
Everyone dies.
