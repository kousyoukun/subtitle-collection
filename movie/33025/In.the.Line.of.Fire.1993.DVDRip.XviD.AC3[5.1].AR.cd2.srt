1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,248
Everyone dies.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,686
Some die
because they deserve to.

3
00:00:03,756 --> 00:00:07,089
Others die simply because
they come from Minneapolis.

4
00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:09,491
lt`s random,
and it`s meaningless.

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,627
lf none of this means anything,
then why kill the president?

6
00:00:15,801 --> 00:00:17,860
To punctuate the dreariness.

7
00:00:17,937 --> 00:00:21,930
lt sounds to me like you need
to get yourself laid.

8
00:00:22,007 --> 00:00:25,238
You're the same as me.

9
00:00:25,311 --> 00:00:28,075
Name one thing in your life
that has any meaning.

10
00:00:30,316 --> 00:00:32,784
- l play the piano.
- That`s not enough.

11
00:00:32,852 --> 00:00:34,285
How do you know?
Do you play?

12
00:00:34,353 --> 00:00:37,254
l've seen you
in your bar alone.

13
00:00:39,225 --> 00:00:42,854
There's no cause left
worth fighting for.

14
00:00:42,928 --> 00:00:45,556
All we have is the game.

15
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:47,064
l'm on offense.

16
00:00:47,132 --> 00:00:48,759
You`re on defense.

17
00:00:48,834 --> 00:00:50,859
When do we start playing the game?

18
00:00:50,936 --> 00:00:53,871
The clock's ticking.

19
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:55,372
Take care.

20
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:57,466
Wait.

21
00:01:03,315 --> 00:01:05,943
He scrambled it again.
l missed him.

22
00:01:06,018 --> 00:01:07,451
Fuck!

23
00:01:12,491 --> 00:01:13,924
Fucker.

24
00:01:38,183 --> 00:01:39,616
Jesus, Frank.

25
00:01:42,254 --> 00:01:44,688
l've been calling for hours.
l thought something happened to you.

26
00:01:44,757 --> 00:01:46,315
Are you okay?

27
00:01:46,392 --> 00:01:48,622
No, l'm not okay.

28
00:01:50,496 --> 00:01:54,489
l'm sick, l'm tired, and l'm armed.
So be careful.

29
00:01:54,567 --> 00:02:00,335
- You're also a genius.
- Not to be recognized in this lifetime.

30
00:02:00,406 --> 00:02:03,671
- You listen to the tapes of the call?
- Yeah. Remember you said--

31
00:02:03,742 --> 00:02:08,304
Call the Minneapolis field office.
Ask about accidental deaths...

32
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,871
anything we might pin to Booth.

33
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,248
- Will you listen to me, please?
- Spit it out.

34
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,777
You said to have field agents
check into model builders.

35
00:02:16,855 --> 00:02:19,449
There's a professor
at the Art Center College of Design...

36
00:02:19,525 --> 00:02:22,688
in Pasadena, California.

37
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:24,319
l think we got something.

38
00:02:24,396 --> 00:02:29,356
Like l told your colleague, l met him
at a design conference in New Orleans.

39
00:02:29,435 --> 00:02:31,369
We ordered some drinks
at a hotel bar.

40
00:02:31,437 --> 00:02:33,598
He seemed like
a nice enough guy.

41
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:35,435
This is good.

42
00:02:35,507 --> 00:02:39,603
But when the talk turned to politics,
he took on a real nasty edge.

43
00:02:39,678 --> 00:02:42,044
He said he felt betrayed
by the government...

44
00:02:42,114 --> 00:02:46,210
and he wanted to exact
some measure of revenge.

45
00:02:46,285 --> 00:02:49,220
The way he said it
scared the shit out of me.

46
00:02:49,288 --> 00:02:52,519
So l said, ''Okay, nice talking
to you. Good luck.''

47
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:54,889
And l got the hell out of there.

48
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,054
But l cannot remember his name.

49
00:02:59,798 --> 00:03:02,733
But l'm pretty sure
he said he was from Phoenix.

50
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:08,729
You guys ought to talk to a guy
in Phoenix named Walter Wickland.

51
00:03:08,807 --> 00:03:10,468
He knows everybody down there.

52
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:12,567
Book us on the first flight
to Phoenix.

53
00:03:12,645 --> 00:03:15,409
How about we get a police artist
together with the professor here...

54
00:03:15,481 --> 00:03:18,245
have a composite sketch
faxed to us?

55
00:03:18,317 --> 00:03:21,582
You figure that one out
all by yourself?

56
00:03:21,654 --> 00:03:23,884
Kiss my ass.

57
00:03:23,956 --> 00:03:26,288
l told you
you'd make a good agent.

58
00:03:28,827 --> 00:03:34,163
lt doesn't look much like him,
but that's got to be Mitch Leary.

59
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:37,760
l haven't seen him
in over a year.

60
00:03:37,836 --> 00:03:39,326
What do you know about the guy?

61
00:03:40,506 --> 00:03:43,100
Do you see this wheelchair?

62
00:03:43,175 --> 00:03:47,111
Mitch bought it for me.
lt cost over a thousand dollars.

63
00:03:48,847 --> 00:03:51,407
- See this?
- Whoa, take it easy.

64
00:03:52,885 --> 00:03:56,116
This is in case
he ever comes back.

65
00:03:56,188 --> 00:03:59,817
He accused me of ripping off
one of his model designs.

66
00:03:59,892 --> 00:04:03,692
Said my penalty
for disloyalty was death.

67
00:04:03,762 --> 00:04:06,959
You put him away, let me know.
l'll sleep better.

68
00:04:07,032 --> 00:04:09,557
You got any idea
where we can find him?

69
00:04:09,635 --> 00:04:13,366
Yeah, l think l might have
his address around here somewhere.

70
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,943
Don't move.

71
00:05:36,588 --> 00:05:38,613
Drop it!

72
00:05:51,336 --> 00:05:54,203
- Let him go, Horrigan.
- l got him.

73
00:05:54,273 --> 00:05:56,332
lt's okay.

74
00:05:56,408 --> 00:06:00,071
We're on the same team.

75
00:06:00,145 --> 00:06:03,478
- Hands, motherfucker!
- l'm getting my identification!

76
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:07,146
Give it to me.

77
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:09,744
David Coppinger, ClA.

78
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:12,989
Who's this asshole?

79
00:06:13,058 --> 00:06:15,185
- He's with me.
- Shit.

80
00:06:17,262 --> 00:06:18,729
Goddamn it.

81
00:06:18,797 --> 00:06:20,355
Are you here for Leary or me?

82
00:06:20,432 --> 00:06:23,424
Mr. Leary used to be
one of our operatives.

83
00:06:26,905 --> 00:06:28,736
He's threatened
to kill the president.

84
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:32,265
We didn't think he was serious
till you found that fingerprint.

85
00:06:32,344 --> 00:06:34,073
But you and the FBl knew.

86
00:06:34,146 --> 00:06:37,343
- l understand your frustration.
- You understand my frustration?

87
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,714
You pompous son of a bitch!

88
00:06:39,785 --> 00:06:41,480
What the fuck
did Leary do for you anyway?

89
00:06:41,553 --> 00:06:44,784
Run coke for the Contras?
Sell arms to lran?

90
00:06:44,857 --> 00:06:48,623
lt's a C-1 2 matter,
so this is off the record.

91
00:06:49,795 --> 00:06:51,695
lf asked, l'll deny it.

92
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:57,265
Leary is what we nowadays
call a wet boy.

93
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,962
What's a wet boy?

94
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,405
- Leary's an assassin.
-Jesus.

95
00:07:03,475 --> 00:07:06,308
ln Leary's case,
that's putting it too gently.

96
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:09,274
He's more like a predator.

97
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:30,361
- Was that you shooting?
- Yes.

98
00:07:30,435 --> 00:07:32,426
What kind of gun is that?

99
00:07:32,504 --> 00:07:34,165
Something l made.

100
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:35,831
No kidding?

101
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:38,467
You made it?

102
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:40,374
Guess it beats paying for it.

103
00:07:41,446 --> 00:07:43,243
Can l see it?

104
00:07:43,315 --> 00:07:44,942
Yeah.

105
00:07:45,017 --> 00:07:47,144
- Shit, it's light.
- Yeah?

106
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:50,188
- What's it made of?
- lt's composite, like plastic.

107
00:07:50,255 --> 00:07:52,155
lt's pretty neat.

108
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:54,522
You mind if l give her
a little dance?

109
00:07:54,593 --> 00:07:56,117
Not at all.

110
00:07:57,095 --> 00:07:58,528
Go for it.

111
00:08:07,472 --> 00:08:10,737
That is really great!

112
00:08:15,013 --> 00:08:17,379
Would you be
interested in selling it?

113
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,408
No, l need it.

114
00:08:20,485 --> 00:08:21,918
For what?

115
00:08:24,156 --> 00:08:26,556
To assassinate the president.

116
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:37,826
- Why would you want to do that?
- Why did you kill that bird, asshole?

117
00:08:46,478 --> 00:08:49,174
Mitch Leary was one of our
most effective contractors...

118
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:52,944
but political climates changed,
and cutbacks were made.

119
00:08:53,018 --> 00:08:56,510
Leary didn't take it too well.
He couldn't adjust to civilian life.

120
00:08:56,588 --> 00:08:58,749
We've been looking for him
for some time.

121
00:08:58,824 --> 00:09:00,758
Maybe you folks in the FBl
will have more luck.

122
00:09:00,826 --> 00:09:03,488
-lf we can work together, it's possible.
-Wouldn't that be refreshing?

123
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,965
We have his fingerprints
and numerous photographs.

124
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:10,126
What makes you think
he looks like any of these?

125
00:09:10,202 --> 00:09:12,033
They're at least 1 5 years old.

126
00:09:12,104 --> 00:09:14,538
A man in his line
stays out of the camera's eye.

127
00:09:14,606 --> 00:09:18,235
They're worthless.
He'll be in disguise anyway.

128
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,904
- We need photo alterations.
- Yeah.

129
00:09:20,979 --> 00:09:24,847
Gentlemen,
what l'm about to show you...

130
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,474
is highly classified.

131
00:09:28,387 --> 00:09:30,321
This man is a former colleague
of Leary's.

132
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:32,619
A close friend...

133
00:09:32,691 --> 00:09:35,626
who went by his home in Phoenix
to try to persuade him...

134
00:09:35,694 --> 00:09:38,128
to accept counseling
and retraining.

135
00:09:38,196 --> 00:09:40,289
This is how Leary
treats his friends.

136
00:09:46,872 --> 00:09:48,806
We need every possible variable:

137
00:09:48,874 --> 00:09:52,002
facial hair,
skin colorization...

138
00:09:52,077 --> 00:09:54,045
glasses, weight changes.

139
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:56,546
Keep in mind,
he's 1 5 years older now.

140
00:10:20,272 --> 00:10:22,968
As good as they are,
they aren't much good.

141
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,474
The eyes are dead.

142
00:10:24,543 --> 00:10:27,478
Always tell a man
by his eyes.

143
00:10:29,414 --> 00:10:32,815
- Look, tomorrow morning, l'd like--
- l'm resigning tomorrow.

144
00:10:32,884 --> 00:10:34,215
What?

145
00:10:36,088 --> 00:10:40,024
Why? Just because
you were scared in Phoenix?

146
00:10:40,092 --> 00:10:42,219
Hell, l was scared too.
You did your job.

147
00:10:43,295 --> 00:10:45,695
l have nightmares...

148
00:10:45,764 --> 00:10:48,426
about that boat,
with the plastic bag over my head.

149
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,333
l can't breathe.

150
00:10:51,403 --> 00:10:54,270
Phoenix just clinched it.

151
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:57,604
- The Service has counseling for this.
- l've been to the counselors.

152
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:02,672
Look, l need you.
We can get this guy.

153
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:05,238
l can't do it!

154
00:11:05,317 --> 00:11:08,775
Stop this cockamamie shit now,
will you?

155
00:11:08,854 --> 00:11:10,287
Come on, pal, l need you.

156
00:11:12,724 --> 00:11:14,419
Please.

157
00:11:30,642 --> 00:11:35,511
Cockamamie. That's a word your
generation hasn't embraced yet.

158
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,013
Maybe you ought to use it
once in a while...

159
00:11:37,082 --> 00:11:40,074
just to keep it alive.

160
00:11:40,152 --> 00:11:42,086
- Cockamamie.
- Yeah.

161
00:11:43,822 --> 00:11:46,552
- Oh, God.
- lt made you laugh, for Christ's sake.

162
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,253
You kill me.

163
00:11:49,327 --> 00:11:52,353
Frank, he's on the line!

164
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,863
l got it.

165
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:57,993
- Hello?
- Hello, Frank.

166
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:01,505
Let me take a second to give
a hearty welcome to all of you...

167
00:12:01,573 --> 00:12:03,939
joining our program in progress.

168
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:07,172
l know who you are, Leary.

169
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:14,808
l'm glad, Frank.

170
00:12:14,886 --> 00:12:17,252
Friends should be able
to call each other by name.

171
00:12:17,322 --> 00:12:18,789
We're not friends.

172
00:12:18,857 --> 00:12:21,189
Sure we are.

173
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:23,193
l've seen what you do to friends.

174
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,063
What's that supposed to mean?

175
00:12:27,132 --> 00:12:29,430
You slit your friend's throat.

176
00:12:39,411 --> 00:12:41,572
You talked to Coppinger?

177
00:12:41,646 --> 00:12:44,410
Yeah, that`s right.

178
00:12:44,482 --> 00:12:46,507
Did you delouse?

179
00:12:46,585 --> 00:12:48,416
The man's a professional liar.

180
00:12:48,486 --> 00:12:50,317
l saw the photos.

181
00:12:50,388 --> 00:12:53,482
No,you saw what
he wanted you to see.

182
00:12:53,558 --> 00:12:55,617
l saw a picture
of your friend...

183
00:12:55,694 --> 00:12:57,127
lying on the floor
with his throat cut.

184
00:12:57,195 --> 00:13:00,289
But you didn't see
what you couldn't possibly know.

185
00:13:00,365 --> 00:13:04,028
They sent my best friend,
my comrade in arms...

186
00:13:04,102 --> 00:13:07,663
to my home to kill me!

187
00:13:07,739 --> 00:13:09,263
Your voice is shaking.

188
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:11,901
l never lied to you,
and l never will!

189
00:13:11,977 --> 00:13:13,911
Why is it everyone
who ever knew you...

190
00:13:13,979 --> 00:13:16,470
said that you're
a sick son of a bitch?

191
00:13:16,548 --> 00:13:18,539
Your colleagues, your wife.

192
00:13:18,617 --> 00:13:20,482
What does your wife say
about you?

193
00:13:20,552 --> 00:13:22,110
We're not talking about me.

194
00:13:22,187 --> 00:13:26,681
-l want you of all people to understand.
-Why should l understand?

195
00:13:26,758 --> 00:13:30,751
We both used to think this country
was a very special place!

196
00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:33,957
- You don`t know what l used to think.
- But you know about me?

197
00:13:34,032 --> 00:13:37,832
Do you have any idea what l've done
for God and country?

198
00:13:37,902 --> 00:13:40,666
Some pretty fucking horrible things!

199
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:43,173
l don't even remember
who l was...

200
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:45,766
before they sunk their claws
into me.

201
00:13:45,844 --> 00:13:49,871
- They made you into a real monster.
-And now they want to destroy me...

202
00:13:49,948 --> 00:13:53,577
because we can't have monsters
roaming the quiet countryside.

203
00:13:56,921 --> 00:14:00,687
What do you see when you're
in the dark and the demons come?

204
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,657
l see you.

205
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:09,996
l see you standing
over the grave...

206
00:14:10,068 --> 00:14:12,127
of another dead president.

207
00:14:12,203 --> 00:14:14,364
That's not going to happen.
l'm on to you.

208
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:17,670
Fuck you. l am willing
to trade my life for his.

209
00:14:17,742 --> 00:14:21,041
l am smart and willing,
and that is all it takes.

210
00:14:21,112 --> 00:14:23,774
That president is coming home
from California...

211
00:14:23,848 --> 00:14:25,577
in a fucking box.

212
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,811
Where in California?

213
00:14:27,886 --> 00:14:30,582
You want the address?

214
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,122
Come on.

215
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,988
l'll keep you in the game,
but l'm not going to throw it for you.

216
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,755
Give yourself up.

217
00:14:36,828 --> 00:14:39,058
So l can live a long
and fruitful life?

218
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,563
We can work something out.

219
00:14:40,632 --> 00:14:42,725
Fuck you.

220
00:14:42,801 --> 00:14:44,359
Don't fucking lie to me.

221
00:14:44,436 --> 00:14:46,563
l have a rendezvous with death.

222
00:14:46,638 --> 00:14:49,471
And so does the president.

223
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,771
So do you,
if you get too close to me.

224
00:14:51,843 --> 00:14:54,710
You have a rendezvous
with my ass, motherfucker!

225
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:59,045
Do you know how easily
l could kill you?

226
00:14:59,117 --> 00:15:02,951
Do you know how many times l've watched
you go in and out of that apartment?

227
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:06,013
You`re alive because
l have allowed you to live.

228
00:15:06,091 --> 00:15:07,581
So you show me...

229
00:15:07,659 --> 00:15:09,627
some goddamn respect!

230
00:15:21,206 --> 00:15:23,766
St. Francis Hotel,
Florida Avenue in northeast.

231
00:15:29,647 --> 00:15:31,581
Let's go! Move it!

232
00:18:37,268 --> 00:18:38,701
Take my hand.

233
00:18:41,105 --> 00:18:43,266
Take it.
You don't, you'll die.

234
00:19:06,531 --> 00:19:09,398
You're going to shoot me,
after l saved your life?

235
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:16,069
Shit!

236
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,701
The only way to save the president
is to shoot me.

237
00:19:20,912 --> 00:19:24,814
Are you willing
to trade your life for his?

238
00:19:24,882 --> 00:19:26,782
Or is life too precious?

239
00:19:44,068 --> 00:19:46,002
Don't fucking move!

240
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,570
Frank, l got him.

241
00:20:34,786 --> 00:20:36,219
Nothing here.

242
00:21:27,605 --> 00:21:29,664
Frank, you got a phone call.

243
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:44,821
- Yeah.
- You looked so sad on the bus.

244
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:47,653
l'm sorry.
lt was self-defense.

245
00:21:54,098 --> 00:21:55,531
Tell me about Skellum.

246
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,591
You`re barking
up the wrong tree.

247
00:21:57,668 --> 00:21:59,533
Skellum`s worthless.

248
00:21:59,604 --> 00:22:01,071
Meeting him in Los Angeles?

249
00:22:03,241 --> 00:22:05,539
lt's late in the game,
and you're way behind.

250
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,475
l'm way ahead.

251
00:22:07,545 --> 00:22:09,911
l know what you look like.
l've seen your eyes.

252
00:22:09,981 --> 00:22:11,608
My eyes might look different next time.

253
00:22:11,682 --> 00:22:13,206
What's behind them won't.

254
00:22:13,284 --> 00:22:15,445
You better pray
l don't find you, prick.

255
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,853
'' Pray''?
Do you want to kill me?

256
00:22:18,923 --> 00:22:20,356
That's right.

257
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:24,118
The irony is so thick
you could choke on it.

258
00:22:24,195 --> 00:22:26,163
There's no fucking irony,
Mitch!

259
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,925
Think.

260
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:32,197
The same government that trained me
to kill, trained you to protect.

261
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:36,434
Yet now you want to kill me,
while, up on that roof, l protected you.

262
00:22:36,507 --> 00:22:38,338
They'll write books about us.

263
00:22:38,409 --> 00:22:40,400
l'm tired of your bullshit!

264
00:22:40,478 --> 00:22:41,911
Don`t be a poor sport.

265
00:22:44,649 --> 00:22:48,551
You could have taken me out,
but you chose to save your ass.

266
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:50,553
Don't cry about it now.

267
00:22:53,191 --> 00:22:55,716
lt does make me wonder
about Dallas though.

268
00:22:55,793 --> 00:22:59,320
Did you really do
all you could have...

269
00:22:59,397 --> 00:23:01,331
or did you
make a choice there too?

270
00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:07,337
Do you really have the guts
to take a bullet?

271
00:23:08,906 --> 00:23:11,841
l'll be thinking about that
when l'm pissing on your grave.

272
00:23:18,182 --> 00:23:20,844
There's no one named Skellum
in all of Los Angeles?

273
00:23:20,918 --> 00:23:23,716
- Ran five different counties.
- What about Louisiana?

274
00:23:23,788 --> 00:23:25,915
Jack was checking that.
Hang on.

275
00:23:29,527 --> 00:23:32,894
No Skellums. Sorry.

276
00:23:32,964 --> 00:23:34,397
Shit.

277
00:23:34,465 --> 00:23:35,898
Damn it!

278
00:23:44,108 --> 00:23:47,043
The election's in three weeks. You're
asking me to commit political suicide.

279
00:23:47,111 --> 00:23:48,942
l'm asking you
to stay out of California.

280
00:23:49,013 --> 00:23:53,040
lf this guy's so smart, he won't
tell you where he'll make an attempt.

281
00:23:53,117 --> 00:23:54,709
He wouldn't lie to me.

282
00:23:54,785 --> 00:23:58,186
lsn't that sweet?
Have you become that close?

283
00:23:59,457 --> 00:24:03,826
California is the key
to the whole damn race.

284
00:24:03,895 --> 00:24:06,455
We've narrowed the gap to five points.
We can't let up now.

285
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:10,057
We'll change our procedures.
Move him around in unmarked cars.

286
00:24:10,134 --> 00:24:12,659
Frisk everyone withing 50 yards.

287
00:24:12,737 --> 00:24:16,867
Frisk people going
into $1 0,000-a-plate dinners?

288
00:24:18,109 --> 00:24:19,804
You're overreacting again.

289
00:24:19,877 --> 00:24:22,277
lf l don't overreact,
the president's dead.

290
00:24:22,346 --> 00:24:25,076
Why is he here?
l said keep him away.

291
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:26,776
Frank's heading
this investigation.

292
00:24:26,851 --> 00:24:28,648
Then let him investigate.

293
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:31,449
As long as he doesn't come
within sight of the president.

294
00:24:31,522 --> 00:24:35,014
Now, if you'll excuse me,
l'm in the middle of a campaign here.

295
00:24:45,703 --> 00:24:47,136
Hi.

296
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,131
Up late?

297
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:52,675
Lead advance for Los Angeles.

298
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:54,836
lt's a lot of work.

299
00:24:54,912 --> 00:24:57,710
- What's up?
- l've got a request.

300
00:25:00,985 --> 00:25:03,954
l'd like you to talk to Watts.

301
00:25:04,021 --> 00:25:05,511
Get me on your advance team.

302
00:25:10,261 --> 00:25:13,697
- He thinks you'll overreact.
- What do you think?

303
00:25:15,266 --> 00:25:17,461
l think maybe
you're too close to all this.

304
00:25:17,535 --> 00:25:20,561
That's why l've got to be there.

305
00:25:20,638 --> 00:25:23,402
l can spot him.
l can anticipate him.

306
00:25:23,474 --> 00:25:25,999
- You think he'll be in California?
- Yes.

307
00:25:26,077 --> 00:25:30,309
- Why would he tip his hand like that?
- To keep the game close.

308
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:32,144
He'll be there.

309
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:38,651
This has nothing to do with you and me.
Strictly professional.

310
00:25:40,725 --> 00:25:45,424
But that son of a bitch
killed my partner, my friend.

311
00:25:45,496 --> 00:25:46,929
l know.

312
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:49,832
l'm sorry.

313
00:25:54,238 --> 00:25:57,230
You're looking
at a living legend:

314
00:25:57,308 --> 00:26:00,141
the only active agent
who ever lost a president.

315
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:05,179
Please?

316
00:26:10,121 --> 00:26:13,420
Passengers arriving on flight 1 026
from Washington, Dulles...

317
00:26:13,491 --> 00:26:14,924
may claim their baggage--

318
00:26:20,865 --> 00:26:22,958
Mr. Horrigan,
welcome to Los Angeles.

319
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:27,269
Here in Washington
analysts ask:

320
00:26:27,338 --> 00:26:30,535
Can the president close
the remaining distance in time?

321
00:26:30,608 --> 00:26:32,667
The answer lies
in California...

322
00:26:32,743 --> 00:26:34,472
where the president
will appear at a rally...

323
00:26:34,545 --> 00:26:36,638
at the Bonaventure Hotel
in Los Angeles.

324
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:47,581
Field office, Chavez.

325
00:26:47,658 --> 00:26:50,422
The advance team is at the Bonaventure.
l`ll stick with them.

326
00:26:50,494 --> 00:26:51,927
Will advise.

327
00:27:39,643 --> 00:27:42,077
- Any problems?
- No, secured up.

328
00:27:47,451 --> 00:27:49,146
Security Room, TSD.

329
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,017
We swept the western end
of the motorcade route.

330
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:53,352
Manholes are secured,
mailboxes removed...

331
00:27:53,424 --> 00:27:55,654
abandoned vehicles towed,
bridges checked out.

332
00:27:55,726 --> 00:27:57,717
We`re moving to sector three.

333
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,792
We'll need sharpshooters
on both those towers there.

334
00:28:07,705 --> 00:28:10,697
We'll place
three sharpshooters there...

335
00:28:10,774 --> 00:28:13,208
which covers
those restricted blocks.

336
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:16,940
Other polls today
had the president still gaining...

337
00:28:17,014 --> 00:28:20,313
but analysts say
if he`s going to close the margin...

338
00:28:20,384 --> 00:28:22,079
it will have to be
on that California trail.

339
00:28:31,428 --> 00:28:34,192
Welcome to Los Angeles
lnternational Airport.

340
00:28:34,265 --> 00:28:38,463
Baggage claim and ground transportation
are on the lower level.

341
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:13,769
Radio operators
will set up over here.

342
00:29:27,618 --> 00:29:30,644
Presidential Suite.
Yeah, who's this?

343
00:29:30,721 --> 00:29:33,451
TSD is up here
sweeping the room right now.

344
00:30:17,701 --> 00:30:19,191
That's it.
Work hard.

345
00:30:32,216 --> 00:30:35,481
Raines, this is Horrigan.
Double-checking those exits?

346
00:30:35,552 --> 00:30:38,749
Yes. This is the third time now.

347
00:30:48,232 --> 00:30:51,759
Watch list: Paul Rubiak,
yellow, section five.

348
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:00,307
- Secret Service.
- Get the fuck--

349
00:31:08,352 --> 00:31:09,944
Robert Stermer.

350
00:31:12,489 --> 00:31:13,979
He's a bellboy.
He's been cleared.

351
00:31:14,058 --> 00:31:15,685
- Yeah, he's clean.
- All right.

352
00:31:17,761 --> 00:31:20,093
Have a nice day.

353
00:31:22,499 --> 00:31:25,400
Show's over, folks.
Let's pack it up.

354
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:28,267
Let's go.
Pack it up and move.

355
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,235
Mr. Carney?
All set.

356
00:31:32,609 --> 00:31:34,372
Finally we meet.

357
00:31:34,445 --> 00:31:36,276
You areJames Carney?

358
00:31:36,347 --> 00:31:38,178
You must be Sandy Riggs.

359
00:31:38,248 --> 00:31:40,182
l was starting to wonder
if you really existed...

360
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:43,117
or maybe you were an angel
sent down to help the party.

361
00:31:43,187 --> 00:31:44,620
l'm very much human.

362
00:31:44,688 --> 00:31:46,121
Let's have a drink.

363
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:48,317
They got a bar up
at the top of this place.

364
00:31:48,392 --> 00:31:50,690
lt's beautiful!
What a view!

365
00:31:50,761 --> 00:31:52,991
When does the president arrive?

366
00:31:53,063 --> 00:31:55,827
Tomorrow evening,
just in time for dinner.

367
00:31:55,899 --> 00:31:58,527
Here's your invitation.
Don't lose that.

368
00:31:58,602 --> 00:32:01,833
The Secret Service
has been driving me bonkers.

369
00:32:01,905 --> 00:32:03,566
l got you a great seat.

370
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,302
lt's just a stone's throw away
from the president himself.

371
00:32:07,978 --> 00:32:12,278
So, tell me,James,
what is Microspan Corporation all about?

372
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:14,374
l just came
to meet the president.

373
00:32:14,451 --> 00:32:17,181
l wouldn't presume
to bore you with my business.

374
00:32:17,254 --> 00:32:21,315
l don't blame you. One thing
l don't understand is high-tech.

375
00:32:21,392 --> 00:32:23,189
l can't wait
to introduce you to him.

376
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,490
Would you look
at this beautiful view?

377
00:32:27,297 --> 00:32:29,231
Yes, it is very pretty.

378
00:32:31,769 --> 00:32:33,259
Did you get the list
of the dinner guests?

379
00:32:33,337 --> 00:32:35,066
Who is the fat cat organizer?

380
00:32:35,139 --> 00:32:36,936
Yes, Sanford Riggs...

381
00:32:37,007 --> 00:32:39,066
the Chairman
of the California Victory Fund.

382
00:32:41,512 --> 00:32:44,413
Call Keziah over at LAPD...

383
00:32:44,481 --> 00:32:46,506
and make sure they have
no police uniforms missing.

384
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:48,141
lt's been taken care of.

385
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:51,654
Call the hospital to see if
they have that supply of B-positive.

386
00:32:53,557 --> 00:32:56,048
Your average American businessman...

387
00:32:56,126 --> 00:32:58,924
looks at a product,
a marketing scheme, what have you...

388
00:32:58,996 --> 00:33:01,658
and he sees the length
and width of it.

389
00:33:01,732 --> 00:33:04,826
TheJapanese see the depth,
the long-term effect.

390
00:33:04,902 --> 00:33:07,132
We look at the next fiscal quarter.

391
00:33:07,204 --> 00:33:10,367
TheJapanese look
at the next quarter of a century.

392
00:33:10,441 --> 00:33:12,932
Try to get our people
to understand that,John, huh?

393
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:16,173
Mr. Riggs,
can l talk to you for a moment?

394
00:33:16,246 --> 00:33:17,679
Excuse me, fellows.

395
00:33:18,982 --> 00:33:21,917
- Who's that?
- Secret Service agent.

396
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,554
Do you know everyone who's
attending this dinner personally?

397
00:33:25,622 --> 00:33:27,055
l sure do.

398
00:33:27,124 --> 00:33:29,649
How about these pictures here?
Any of them look familiar?

399
00:33:29,726 --> 00:33:32,388
l went through all this
with another agent yesterday.

400
00:33:32,463 --> 00:33:33,953
l'll cooperate...

401
00:33:34,031 --> 00:33:36,022
but this is bordering
on harassment.

402
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:39,296
Yeah,
l'm a harassing kind of guy.

403
00:33:44,308 --> 00:33:47,038
l'll be right back,
Mr. Carney.

404
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:50,238
- He did what any of us would have.
- He beat up a bellboy on television.

405
00:33:50,314 --> 00:33:52,748
- l was there.
- l`d say he`s overwrought.

406
00:33:52,816 --> 00:33:56,081
We're all a little overwrought
knowing Leary's out there someplace.

407
00:33:56,153 --> 00:33:59,418
- You don`t think he`s a liability?
- No, l don't.

408
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:01,754
You`re in the minority. l want him
gone before Traveler arrives.

409
00:34:01,825 --> 00:34:04,259
- That's not fair.
- Send him to San Diego in the morning.

410
00:34:04,328 --> 00:34:07,092
By whose order?
Harry Sargent's?

411
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:11,425
You want to tell him or should l?

412
00:34:11,502 --> 00:34:14,903
Somebody's approaching
Traveler's suite.

413
00:34:14,972 --> 00:34:16,405
Lilly,you there?

414
00:34:52,876 --> 00:34:54,468
Hi.

415
00:34:57,047 --> 00:34:59,982
What are you doing up here?

416
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:03,486
l was just seeing if there was
anything more l could do.

417
00:35:06,223 --> 00:35:08,487
You know, between
the Los Angeles Police Department...

418
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:11,995
the FBl and the rest of us...

419
00:35:12,062 --> 00:35:16,328
there are 229 people
protecting Traveler tomorrow.

420
00:35:18,402 --> 00:35:19,994
A lot of guns.

421
00:35:21,905 --> 00:35:25,466
Leary gets off a shot, you and l
could be killed in the cross fire.

422
00:35:34,251 --> 00:35:36,185
Bill Watts just called.

423
00:35:37,254 --> 00:35:39,017
Heard about the bellman?

424
00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:40,522
So did Traveler.

425
00:35:42,259 --> 00:35:46,355
They want you to go to San Diego and
assist in the advance there tomorrow.

426
00:35:48,265 --> 00:35:50,199
Just like that.

427
00:35:52,269 --> 00:35:55,363
lt's not just you against Leary.

428
00:35:56,807 --> 00:35:59,401
You gotta have some faith
in the rest of us.

429
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,872
You know something?

430
00:36:08,785 --> 00:36:12,551
For years l've been listening
to all these idiots on bar stools...

431
00:36:12,623 --> 00:36:16,389
with all their pet theories
on Dallas.

432
00:36:18,128 --> 00:36:21,393
How it was the Cubans
or the ClA...

433
00:36:21,465 --> 00:36:24,400
or the white supremacists
or the mob...

434
00:36:24,468 --> 00:36:30,236
or whether it was one weapon
or whether it was five.

435
00:36:32,309 --> 00:36:34,675
None of that's meant
too much to me.

436
00:36:36,546 --> 00:36:40,243
But Leary--

437
00:36:40,317 --> 00:36:44,310
He questioned whether l had the guts
to take that fatal bullet.

438
00:36:48,325 --> 00:36:50,259
God, that was a beautiful day.

439
00:36:54,364 --> 00:36:56,355
The sun was out.

440
00:36:58,502 --> 00:37:01,938
Had been raining all morning.
The air was--

441
00:37:05,842 --> 00:37:10,438
The first shot sounded
like a firecracker.

442
00:37:10,514 --> 00:37:13,915
l looked over and saw him.
l could tell he was hit.

443
00:37:18,188 --> 00:37:22,488
l don't know why l didn't react.
l should have reacted.

444
00:37:23,694 --> 00:37:26,288
l should have been running flat-out.

445
00:37:27,731 --> 00:37:29,665
l just couldn't believe it.

446
00:37:34,705 --> 00:37:39,301
lf only l reacted,
l could have taken that shot.

447
00:37:44,948 --> 00:37:47,314
That would have been
all right with me.

448
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,692
What's the number
of that San Diego office?

449
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:41,465
61 9-Ukulele.

450
00:38:41,538 --> 00:38:44,063
- '' Ukulele''?
- That's how l remember it.

451
00:38:44,141 --> 00:38:49,101
Seven numbers, seven letters.
You just push u-k-e-l-e-l-e. Easy.

452
00:38:51,148 --> 00:38:54,413
Wait a minute.
lsn't ukulele spelled u-k-u?

453
00:38:55,952 --> 00:39:00,389
l don't know.
But the phone number's u-k-e-l-e-l-e.

454
00:39:15,806 --> 00:39:17,239
Wait a second.

455
00:39:17,307 --> 00:39:18,899
Attention, all passengers.

456
00:39:18,975 --> 00:39:22,877
Flight 1 58 to San Diego
is now boarding at Gate 7.

457
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:37,426
Jesus.

458
00:39:37,494 --> 00:39:41,430
We have an arrival. Chopper standing by
to take Traveler to site one.

459
00:39:56,513 --> 00:39:58,947
Southwest Savings.
May l help you?

460
00:39:59,015 --> 00:40:02,917
- Southwest?
- Yes. May l help you?

461
00:40:02,986 --> 00:40:06,285
- Hello?
- What's your address?

462
00:40:11,695 --> 00:40:13,458
Taxi!

463
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,291
Raines to lobby agents,
post check.

464
00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:22,133
- Post three?
- Roger. ln place.

465
00:40:22,205 --> 00:40:24,833
- Post six?
- Roger. ln place.

466
00:40:24,908 --> 00:40:28,002
- Post 1 2?
- Roger. ln place.

467
00:40:34,217 --> 00:40:35,650
Wait right here.

468
00:40:38,521 --> 00:40:42,423
l'm sorry there's no Mitchell Leary
orJoseph McCrawley in our accounts.

469
00:40:42,492 --> 00:40:45,120
Try to imagine him
in disguise: a hat...

470
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:48,596
wigs, mustache,
that sort of thing.

471
00:40:48,665 --> 00:40:51,327
l haven't seen him, but l've only
been here a couple weeks.

472
00:40:51,401 --> 00:40:54,495
Who was in charge
of new accounts before you?

473
00:40:54,571 --> 00:40:56,004
Pam Magnus.

474
00:40:57,073 --> 00:40:59,735
Where can l find her?

475
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:03,270
She's dead.

476
00:41:03,346 --> 00:41:05,678
She was murdered.

477
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:40,379
She was murdered,
and she was from Minneapolis.

478
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:43,112
They won't cancel.
You know what Sargent said.

479
00:41:43,186 --> 00:41:46,053
At least make the arrival underground.
Don't give Leary a target.

480
00:41:46,122 --> 00:41:49,023
They want a big show.
They said unless we have proof--

481
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:51,686
The proof may just be
a dead president.

482
00:41:58,068 --> 00:42:01,231
l'm pulling up all the accounts
opened during Pam's last six months.

483
00:42:01,304 --> 00:42:05,240
We don't log them by the date entered.
lt's going to take time to compile.

484
00:42:05,308 --> 00:42:08,209
Fax me the list as soon
as you get them, please.

485
00:42:10,981 --> 00:42:13,575
All agents in position.

486
00:43:19,149 --> 00:43:21,481
Please step back, sir.

487
00:43:22,552 --> 00:43:24,486
Please empty your pockets.

488
00:43:26,389 --> 00:43:27,822
Thank you.

489
00:44:21,845 --> 00:44:23,278
You're from Texas, right?

490
00:44:32,122 --> 00:44:35,888
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

491
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,433
lt's fantastic.

492
00:44:49,172 --> 00:44:50,730
l'm sorry?

493
00:46:05,548 --> 00:46:09,040
Frank, what are you doing here?
Watts will shit if he sees you.

494
00:46:09,118 --> 00:46:11,985
- You get a fax for me?
- Yeah,just now.

495
00:46:12,055 --> 00:46:14,819
What is it?
What's this about?

496
00:46:18,161 --> 00:46:20,652
What the hell is going on?

497
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,964
Jesus.

498
00:47:20,123 --> 00:47:23,559
- What the hell is he doing here?
- l don't know.

499
00:47:25,128 --> 00:47:28,222
- Who gave you permission--
- He's here. His name is Jim Carney.

500
00:47:28,298 --> 00:47:31,233
- You're not on this post.
- l want the damn seating chart!

501
00:47:31,301 --> 00:47:32,928
Give him the chart.

502
00:48:03,066 --> 00:48:05,034
Gun!

503
00:48:19,349 --> 00:48:21,544
Put the gun down!

504
00:48:24,187 --> 00:48:25,984
Move!

505
00:48:36,866 --> 00:48:38,834
Don't shoot!
Out of the way!

506
00:48:45,174 --> 00:48:46,766
Get down!

507
00:48:51,381 --> 00:48:53,042
Lock him up!

508
00:48:53,116 --> 00:48:55,209
Don't shoot!

509
00:48:55,284 --> 00:48:57,514
Get him in! Come on!

510
00:48:57,587 --> 00:48:59,020
- lnside!
- Move it!

511
00:49:04,794 --> 00:49:06,352
Raines to shooters.
Hold your fire.

512
00:49:13,736 --> 00:49:13,870
Get out of his way!

513
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:15,337
Get out of his way!

514
00:49:16,539 --> 00:49:18,734
He has a hostage!

515
00:49:25,715 --> 00:49:28,411
Raines to shooters.
lf you have a shot, take it!

516
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,567
Nice view.

517
00:49:46,936 --> 00:49:50,030
- What's the plan, Captain?
- lt's your man up there.

518
00:49:50,106 --> 00:49:51,869
You tell me.

519
00:49:53,142 --> 00:49:55,372
All posts, hold radio traffic.

520
00:49:55,445 --> 00:49:59,108
Get me sharpshooters
on the north and west towers.

521
00:49:59,182 --> 00:50:00,672
Take the subject out.

522
00:50:17,967 --> 00:50:21,767
So you had the guts.
You took the bullet.

523
00:50:22,905 --> 00:50:24,463
l broke my damn ribs.

524
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,508
Sorry.
l wasn't aiming at you.

525
00:50:28,444 --> 00:50:29,775
Where are the shooters?

526
00:50:33,483 --> 00:50:35,576
West tower in place.
No lights inside.

527
00:50:35,651 --> 00:50:37,448
Shit. No shot from the north.

528
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:42,253
- We can`t see inside.
- A bulletproof vest is cheating a bit.

529
00:50:42,325 --> 00:50:44,418
Otherwise, you played a good game.

530
00:50:44,494 --> 00:50:49,261
lt's no game, Leary.
l was doing my job.

531
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,058
What are we gonna do now?

532
00:50:52,134 --> 00:50:54,364
Do you believe
in the nobility of suicide?

533
00:50:57,507 --> 00:51:01,102
But if you want to blow your head off,
be my guest.

534
00:51:01,177 --> 00:51:05,580
Nicely put, except l don't want
to leave this miserable world alone.

535
00:51:08,184 --> 00:51:10,778
- West tower, do you have a shot?
- Negative.

536
00:51:10,853 --> 00:51:13,253
Too dark.
Target unclear.

537
00:51:14,557 --> 00:51:17,082
lt's better to die
with a friend.

538
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:19,286
You're not a friend.

539
00:51:19,362 --> 00:51:21,421
You're a damn killer,
you sick bastard.

540
00:51:21,497 --> 00:51:25,331
Don't talk to me like that.
l saved your life. You owe me.

541
00:51:25,401 --> 00:51:30,464
- l don't owe you shit.
- l was always honest and fair with you.

542
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:33,771
- Go ahead and shoot.
- lt's Frank.

543
00:51:33,843 --> 00:51:36,038
Quiet!

544
00:51:36,112 --> 00:51:37,807
Come on, damn it.

545
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,781
- Frank, are you talking to me?
- What are you waiting for?

546
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:42,977
What am l waiting for?

547
00:51:43,052 --> 00:51:46,818
l'm waiting for you to show me
some goddamn gratitude.

548
00:51:46,889 --> 00:51:51,690
Without me, you'd still just be
another sad-eyed, piano-playing drunk.

549
00:51:51,761 --> 00:51:53,786
l brought you into this game.

550
00:51:53,863 --> 00:51:56,127
l let you keep up with me.

551
00:51:56,198 --> 00:51:59,964
- l made you a goddamn hero today.
- You didn't make me anything.

552
00:52:00,036 --> 00:52:03,130
l redeemed your pathetic, shitty life.

553
00:52:03,205 --> 00:52:06,333
l just did my job. You're the one
with the fucking pathetic life.

554
00:52:06,409 --> 00:52:09,867
- Go ahead and shoot, damn it.
- They can't see inside.

555
00:52:09,946 --> 00:52:11,413
lf they fire,you`ll be hit.

556
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,573
l want you to thank me first.

557
00:52:13,649 --> 00:52:16,550
- Shut up and shoot.
- All right.

558
00:52:18,921 --> 00:52:20,411
All right.

559
00:52:20,489 --> 00:52:24,619
Shooters, stand by to fire.
Wait for my command.

560
00:52:26,395 --> 00:52:30,331
- Sleep well, my friend.
-Just one thing: Aim high.

561
00:52:30,399 --> 00:52:32,299
- What?
- Aim high.

562
00:52:33,169 --> 00:52:35,228
- Now.
- You bastard!

563
00:53:26,822 --> 00:53:29,347
Take my hand.

564
00:53:29,425 --> 00:53:31,256
lf you don't, you'll die.

565
00:53:31,327 --> 00:53:33,227
You want to save me?

566
00:53:33,295 --> 00:53:36,753
To be honest and fair with you, no.

567
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,467
But it's my job.

568
00:53:39,535 --> 00:53:41,696
All you people, stay back!

569
00:53:45,274 --> 00:53:46,502
Take it.

570
00:54:42,398 --> 00:54:44,832
- You okay?
- Stand back, please.

571
00:54:49,739 --> 00:54:52,833
We've been working with Agent Horrigan
for quite some time.

572
00:54:52,908 --> 00:54:55,934
Yes, Frank exemplifies
courage and self-sacrifice.

573
00:54:57,947 --> 00:55:01,678
Guess l overreacted again,
huh, Harry?

574
00:55:21,937 --> 00:55:23,700
Agent Horrigan,just a moment.

575
00:55:23,773 --> 00:55:28,107
Agent Horrigan, why are you
retiring from the Secret Service?

576
00:55:28,177 --> 00:55:30,042
Because l hate desk work...

577
00:55:30,112 --> 00:55:32,546
and l'm too old
to run alongside limousines.

578
00:55:32,615 --> 00:55:35,209
And thanks to you people
plastering my picture everywhere...

579
00:55:35,284 --> 00:55:37,218
l'm no good for undercover work.

580
00:55:37,286 --> 00:55:39,550
One more question!

581
00:55:39,622 --> 00:55:41,214
How are you?

582
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:44,726
Frank, the president
sent his limo for you.

583
00:55:44,794 --> 00:55:46,728
- That's the least he could do.
- Good.

584
00:55:46,796 --> 00:55:49,390
l love public transportation.

585
00:55:52,835 --> 00:55:54,268
Come on in.

586
00:55:57,139 --> 00:56:00,404
- Make yourself at home.
- Mm-hmm.

587
00:56:12,321 --> 00:56:15,085
- What do you think?
- l like it.

588
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:18,592
Hello, Frank.

589
00:56:19,995 --> 00:56:23,761
By the time you hear this,
it`ll be over.

590
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:26,927
The president
is most likely dead...

591
00:56:27,002 --> 00:56:29,095
and so am l.

592
00:56:29,171 --> 00:56:32,106
l wonder, Frank,
did you kill me?

593
00:56:32,174 --> 00:56:34,438
Who won our game?

594
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:36,774
Not that it matters.

595
00:56:36,846 --> 00:56:38,609
For among friends,
like you and me...

596
00:56:38,681 --> 00:56:41,115
it`s not whether you win or lose,
but how you play the game.

597
00:56:41,183 --> 00:56:45,779
Now the game is done, and it`s time
to get on with your life.

598
00:56:47,189 --> 00:56:50,625
But l worry that you have
no life to get on with.

599
00:56:52,528 --> 00:56:54,120
You`re a good man...

600
00:56:54,196 --> 00:56:56,790
and good men,
like you and me...

601
00:56:56,866 --> 00:56:59,630
are destined to travel
the lonely road.

602
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:04,067
Good-bye and good luck.

603
00:57:07,877 --> 00:57:10,471
l'll bet you
that brown pigeon down there...

604
00:57:10,546 --> 00:57:13,310
flies off before the white one.

605
00:57:13,382 --> 00:57:14,815
How do you know?

606
00:57:16,385 --> 00:57:18,819
l know things about pigeons.

607
01:03:09,238 --> 01:03:13,174
