1
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,900
I did something good today.

2
00:00:10,715 --> 00:00:11,915
You don't always?

3
00:00:12,567 --> 00:00:14,407
You wanna know about my job?

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,260
Strike.

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,080
Good kill.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,440
Ladies and Gentlemen...

7
00:00:24,015 --> 00:00:26,175
The remotely piloted aircraft

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,920
is not the future of war.

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,680
It is the here and now.

10
00:00:29,751 --> 00:00:32,871
What'd you log? Three thousand hours in F-16s?

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,820
But we've progressed.

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,440
Let's go to Afghanistan.

13
00:00:37,093 --> 00:00:37,893
Fly and fry.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,080
Make no mistake about it.

15
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,400
This ain't Playstation.

16
00:00:41,578 --> 00:00:43,098
We are killing people.

17
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:44,940
Light 'em up.

18
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:48,033
Yes!

19
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,740
You ever get to like, fly in a war or...?

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,080
Blew away six Taliban in Pakistan today.

21
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,900
Now I'm going home to barbecue.

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,280
He's quiet.

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,469
Does he ever get angry?

24
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:03,420
Almost never.

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,800
What happens when he gets angry?

26
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,480
He gets more quiet.

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,040
I am a pilot.

28
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,300
And I'm not flying.

29
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,660
I don't know what it is that I am doing?

30
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,860
But it's not flying.

31
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:16,899
Weapons away. Eight seconds.

32
00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:18,227
Dammit what's that?

33
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,000
Abort?

34
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:28,515
You okay?

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,920
I feel like a coward.

36
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,060
Takin' potshots from half a world away

37
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,924
in an air-conditioned cubicle.

38
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,380
What is it that you miss?!

39
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:41,209
Combat?!

40
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,420
I don't want you getting gun-shy on me. We all pulled the trigger.

41
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,060
We both know I pulled the trigger.

42
00:01:48,955 --> 00:01:52,155
I just want things to go back to the way they were.

43
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,360
I'M OKAY!!!!!!

44
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,400
We are cleared up.

45
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:55,946
Light 'em up.

46
00:01:55,946 --> 00:01:57,603
Don't ask me if it's a just war.

47
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:01,331
It's just war.
