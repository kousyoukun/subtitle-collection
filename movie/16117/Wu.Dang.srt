Newspaper!

00:00:26,024 --> 00:00:29,941
Newspaper! Newspaper!

4
00:00:29,976 --> 00:00:30,397
Hi Joe.

5
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:32,280
Hi James. Where are you going?

6
00:00:32,955 --> 00:00:34,990
Daddy, I've seen your photo.

7
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,072
You've kept pigtail before?

8
00:00:37,617 --> 00:00:40,367
When I was in the U.S. studying,
it was still in the Ching Dynasty

9
00:00:40,368 --> 00:00:43,492
But after the revolution, the government
ordered everyone to cut their pigtails

10
00:00:43,493 --> 00:00:45,324
But many, who are very conservative,

11
00:00:45,325 --> 00:00:48,117
are unable to accept the change of government

12
00:00:48,118 --> 00:00:51,034
But now we are going to Wu Dang Mountain,

13
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:54,483
and after 2 hours the train will start rolling,
but why are we still going to Shanghai?

14
00:00:54,518 --> 00:00:56,944
Because we came back to China to
find the things that we want

15
00:00:56,945 --> 00:01:03,242
It is rumored to be here,
therefore I am going to have a look

16
00:01:03,243 --> 00:01:06,701
Daddy, what is so important?

17
00:01:06,702 --> 00:01:07,952
Wait for me here.

18
00:01:07,953 --> 00:01:09,577
I'll be back soon.

19
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:11,593
Wang, take care good care of her.

20
00:01:11,628 --> 00:01:12,452
Didn't we agree that this time

21
00:01:12,453 --> 00:01:13,952
you won't leave me alone?

22
00:01:13,953 --> 00:01:15,952
Don't worry

23
00:01:15,953 --> 00:01:20,434
From now on, Daddy will not
leave you alone again

24
00:01:34,037 --> 00:01:36,701
Tang Yun Long, Professor Tang?

25
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:38,704
Hmm... This way.

26
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,411
Professor Tang, thank you for
coming to do the examination

27
00:02:01,426 --> 00:02:04,204
Your Lordship, you are too kind.
I've researched this treasure for many years

28
00:02:04,205 --> 00:02:07,650
and today I can see it with my own eyes,
which I consider very fortunate

29
00:02:08,037 --> 00:02:11,955
Professor Tang, I'm honored

30
00:02:11,956 --> 00:02:13,830
And I'm honored as well Mr. Paul Chen

31
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:17,496
You've collected all the ancient treasure
in China, you have amassed great fame.

32
00:02:17,497 --> 00:02:22,102
I'd never figured this mysterious
Tsuen Tien Sword was in your possession

33
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:30,038
This Tsuen Tien Sword has a
history of 2,000 years

34
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,622
Legend has it that the might of the
Tang Dynasty's greatness

35
00:02:32,623 --> 00:02:35,413
it's all because of this sword's mysterious power

36
00:02:35,414 --> 00:02:36,372
Professor Tang

37
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:38,796
Please.

38
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:07,837
Asteroids were used to forge this sword,
It has unique quality and power

39
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:10,707
Originally it was from a mysterious tribe

40
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:13,666
After the tribe perished in a war,
the sword disappeared

41
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:17,291
I've heard that it appeared
in Wu Dang Mountain once

42
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:22,247
Your Lordship, This sword is USD $300,000

43
00:03:22,282 --> 00:03:28,219
In the future, when you've regained your country,
the reward should dwarf the price.

44
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:34,351
Professor Tang

45
00:03:35,376 --> 00:03:41,098
The Dragon Sword with Seven Powers
The sutra gives access to the lightbody.

46
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:46,567
Outside the cave of the Eight Meridian hides the black leader.
The Fiery Pearl in between the Clouds.

47
00:03:47,002 --> 00:03:49,835
It seems that the myth is true

48
00:03:49,836 --> 00:03:53,334
The magical sword is one of the seven treasures

49
00:03:53,335 --> 00:03:57,099
What did you just say?
Seven Treasures?

50
00:03:59,752 --> 00:04:03,649
Maybe... Maybe this is a treasure map?

51
00:04:10,253 --> 00:04:14,210
Tang Yun Long!
What are you up to?

52
00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:16,336
I don't think I'm the trickster here...

53
00:04:17,031 --> 00:04:20,170
This so called Tsuen Tien Sword is a fake!

54
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:22,545
Paul Chen! Fake ass honkey!

55
00:04:22,546 --> 00:04:23,712
Fucking fraud!

56
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,004
How do I know if the two of you are not in cahoots?

57
00:04:26,873 --> 00:04:30,142
I don't care whether you buy or not,
this man has destroyed my property.

58
00:04:30,177 --> 00:04:37,713
You will have to pay!

59
00:05:54,944 --> 00:05:58,016
Get the map back! Get the map back!

60
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:02,757
Wang, start the car!

61
00:06:02,758 --> 00:06:05,492
Daddy, you've been fighting?

62
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:07,818
I am alright.
To the train station. Quick!

63
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:27,633
Men went to battle at the border

64
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:33,342
Woman weaving in the home land

65
00:06:33,343 --> 00:06:37,677
Farming in the day
Spinning wool in the night

66
00:06:37,678 --> 00:06:41,927
Don't know if it's night or day,
will still get the job done

67
00:06:41,928 --> 00:06:46,177
The warriors will have food and clothing

68
00:06:46,178 --> 00:06:48,211
If you don't believe

69
00:06:48,212 --> 00:06:50,509
Just look at the body

70
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,801
Our shoes and socks

71
00:06:52,802 --> 00:06:55,303
and our pants and shirts

72
00:06:55,304 --> 00:06:58,596
Miss, I noticed that you have been
Checking me out.

73
00:06:58,631 --> 00:07:02,199
Have we met before?

74
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,343
Are you a representative of Bei Ping

75
00:07:04,344 --> 00:07:07,219
participating in the
Wu Dang Martial Arts competition?

76
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,137
I am,

77
00:07:08,138 --> 00:07:10,303
from Pin Jin,
2 towns, 2 province

78
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:17,179
and the most handsome fighter

79
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,498
You are exquisite

80
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:22,386
Everything associated with beauty.

81
00:07:22,387 --> 00:07:26,845
Do not disturb the lady!

82
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,429
Don't be afraid

83
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,137
You are going to Hubei?

84
00:07:30,138 --> 00:07:32,721
For what purpose?

85
00:07:32,722 --> 00:07:36,263
To rob

86
00:07:36,264 --> 00:07:39,847
This lady is funny as hell!

87
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:42,346
What are you going to rob?

88
00:07:42,347 --> 00:07:44,889
First I need an invitation entry card

89
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,943
... Just like yours!

90
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:48,512
You think you're going to take my invitation card?

91
00:07:48,513 --> 00:07:52,743
You are going to Wu Dang
for competition, then where should I go?

92
00:07:52,778 --> 00:07:56,378
Well, if you don't give it to me
You'll be looking for medical help.

93
00:07:56,413 --> 00:07:59,969
You think that bullshit is funny?

94
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:47,513
Wudang - Invitation

95
00:10:40,023 --> 00:10:43,021
Pure Land Beyond the Clouds

96
00:10:43,022 --> 00:10:46,772
Purple Mist Hall

97
00:10:46,773 --> 00:10:52,586
Wu Dang - Heaven & Earth's Code

98
00:10:54,398 --> 00:10:57,523
I wonder who are we going to send
for the martial art's competition?

99
00:10:57,524 --> 00:11:01,523
Have you decided yet?

100
00:11:01,524 --> 00:11:04,613
White Dragon, the Master is soundly asleep

101
00:11:04,648 --> 00:11:07,347
Let's not disturb him,
Let's proceed.

102
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:16,398
They haven't arrived yet?

103
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,602
Who are we waiting for?

104
00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:54,074
Ning, be careful!

105
00:11:56,652 --> 00:11:59,911
Are you alright?

106
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,693
Go, go, go, go!

107
00:12:05,694 --> 00:12:08,300
How can anyone be so careless?

108
00:12:08,335 --> 00:12:09,915
Just sped out suddenly.

109
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:13,175
How is it?

110
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,989
The bike is broken.
We'll just have to walk up the mountain road.

111
00:12:15,024 --> 00:12:16,526
Ok.

112
00:12:17,427 --> 00:12:20,135
Daddy, was that a Taoist priest?

113
00:12:20,136 --> 00:12:21,968
I think so.

114
00:12:21,969 --> 00:12:24,427
He is very compassionate.

115
00:12:24,428 --> 00:12:26,613
Let's go.

116
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:37,429
Sui He-Yi, you're late.

117
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,553
Brother,

118
00:12:38,554 --> 00:12:41,927
I...

119
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,468
Why is the water half full?

120
00:12:43,469 --> 00:12:44,262
Brother,

121
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,928
half way on the road,

122
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:48,595
Someone was driving like a mad man
up the road, almost hit me.

123
00:12:48,596 --> 00:12:49,609
And I spilled some water.

124
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,887
Are you lying to me?

125
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:55,054
You know the rules laid down
by White Dragon priest are very strict

126
00:12:55,055 --> 00:12:57,679
Go over there and pluck out all the weeds

127
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,322
Yes, brother.

128
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,053
How are you...

129
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:13,054
We are here to participate in
the martial art's competition

130
00:13:13,055 --> 00:13:16,480
Taoist Xie has died!
Taoist Xie has died!

131
00:13:20,638 --> 00:13:23,277
Go, go, go. Quickly!

132
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,305
What's going on?

133
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:27,492
The head priest is dead.

134
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:34,806
Uncle, the head priest has passed.

135
00:13:34,807 --> 00:13:42,807
Excuse me...

136
00:13:50,765 --> 00:13:54,597
There is no pulse.

137
00:13:54,598 --> 00:13:57,598
The head priest has passed on.

138
00:13:57,599 --> 00:13:59,765
We are all very sad.

139
00:13:59,766 --> 00:14:03,182
Life is but a fleeting thing.

140
00:14:03,183 --> 00:14:04,474
I believe,

141
00:14:04,475 --> 00:14:10,181
he has attained nirvana and ascended

142
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,432
Who is he?

143
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,182
He is the martial art
tournament sponsor

144
00:14:13,183 --> 00:14:15,557
Mr. Tang Yun Long

145
00:14:17,642 --> 00:14:20,433
Even though the head priest's vital
signs are gone

146
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:23,225
But if I am not wrong,

147
00:14:23,226 --> 00:14:25,308
he is using Turtle Relaxation technique.

148
00:14:25,309 --> 00:14:27,933
According to western science

149
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,559
Is temporary hibernation.

150
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,517
Hibernation?

151
00:14:30,518 --> 00:14:31,434
Yes.

152
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:33,309
He's gone into a state of nothingness,

153
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,975
just like a deity.

154
00:14:34,976 --> 00:14:38,100
The head priest's powers are
beyond comprehension

155
00:14:38,101 --> 00:14:43,726
Taoist Xie

156
00:14:43,727 --> 00:14:45,934
Taoist Xie is alive!

157
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:48,434
Head Priest, you're alive!

158
00:14:48,435 --> 00:14:50,560
Thank Goodness!

159
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:51,476
Hey, excellent!

160
00:14:51,477 --> 00:14:54,810
You're here, finally!

161
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,101
Everyone,

162
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:59,936
Sui He-Yi is Wu Dang's representative.

163
00:14:59,937 --> 00:15:00,852
You're really great

164
00:15:00,853 --> 00:15:02,269
The head priest is alive and well.

165
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,644
You again!

166
00:15:03,645 --> 00:15:06,059
Sui He-Yi is only a lay disciple,

167
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,352
Even he knows a bit of martial arts

168
00:15:08,353 --> 00:15:10,602
but it is not sufficient for this

169
00:15:10,603 --> 00:15:13,101
Besides, there are others with more seniority.

170
00:15:13,102 --> 00:15:14,602
It wouldn't be his turn to represent.

171
00:15:14,603 --> 00:15:16,060
Yes.

172
00:15:16,061 --> 00:15:17,268
Yes, he is right,
Head Priest Xie.

173
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:19,353
My kung fu is inadequate,

174
00:15:19,354 --> 00:15:20,895
and not up to par.

175
00:15:20,896 --> 00:15:22,894
My only desire is to take
care of my mother

176
00:15:22,895 --> 00:15:25,145
and to cure her sickness

177
00:15:25,146 --> 00:15:27,312
Such an important task.
I won't be able to undertake it

178
00:15:27,313 --> 00:15:29,978
To be able to do without doing,

179
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:33,061
To be able to walk without walking.

180
00:15:33,062 --> 00:15:34,811
Head priest,

181
00:15:34,812 --> 00:15:36,269
If he were to represent us,

182
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,437
we are bound to lose

183
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,395
Besides,

184
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,646
Since the competition is every 500 years

185
00:15:41,647 --> 00:15:45,688
Wu Dang cannot be embarassed.

186
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:48,271
To lose is to win,

187
00:15:48,272 --> 00:15:51,021
To win is to lose.

188
00:15:51,022 --> 00:15:53,187
Make good the preparation

189
00:15:53,188 --> 00:15:54,812
Fight!

190
00:15:54,813 --> 00:15:56,062
Wait!

191
00:15:56,063 --> 00:16:04,063
I haven't asked my mother yet!

192
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:38,523
What you're holding is the treasure map, right?

193
00:16:38,524 --> 00:16:40,565
No, there isn't any treasure map.

194
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,191
Unless,

195
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:50,192
you came here to rob treasures?

196
00:16:56,942 --> 00:16:58,442
I'm very sorry, priest

197
00:16:58,443 --> 00:16:59,358
I've lost my way

198
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:02,691
May I ask, if this is Blissful Palace?

199
00:17:02,692 --> 00:17:04,566
I am not a priest.

200
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:08,275
My dear lady, the priest you are
looking for is over there

201
00:17:08,276 --> 00:17:10,733
Hello priest, how are you?

202
00:17:10,734 --> 00:17:12,774
It's like this

203
00:17:12,775 --> 00:17:15,109
I am a representative of Pin Jin
of 2 town, 2 provinces

204
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:20,443
I am here for the competition.

205
00:17:20,444 --> 00:17:21,942
My junior is sick.

206
00:17:21,943 --> 00:17:23,692
So, I took his place.

207
00:17:23,693 --> 00:17:25,568
My name is Tien Xin

208
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:33,569
and I'm honored to meet you both.

209
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:53,194
To commemorate the renovation of Wu Dang
500 years anniversary

210
00:17:53,195 --> 00:17:56,403
and the reconstruction of the Five Dragon Place

211
00:17:56,404 --> 00:17:59,943
Today, a competition is held for
young martial artists

212
00:17:59,944 --> 00:18:02,819
Representatives from the whole of China

213
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,194
Overseas Chinese organization’s representatives

214
00:18:05,195 --> 00:18:07,610
With the spirit to promote Taoism

215
00:18:07,611 --> 00:18:12,486
To encourage youth to learn
leadership, learning and dissemination,

216
00:18:12,487 --> 00:18:14,403
To attend this conference.

217
00:18:14,404 --> 00:18:18,612
Representative from Sichuan,
Kong Tong sect - Wei Chuen Yang

218
00:18:18,613 --> 00:18:26,613
His opponent, from Bei Ping,
Tianjin, Dragon's Gate sect, Tien Xin

219
00:18:32,031 --> 00:18:33,404
I never fight with women

220
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:41,071
just go home.

221
00:18:41,072 --> 00:18:43,113
The biggest mistake in your life,

222
00:18:43,114 --> 00:18:51,114
is to underestimate a woman.

223
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,571
This is called Cannon Hammer.

224
00:19:06,572 --> 00:19:07,857
If you get struck by that blow,

225
00:19:07,858 --> 00:19:08,947
that will be disastrous.

226
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:10,989
If you meet an opponent like this,

227
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:15,865
Don't fight and just admit defeat.

228
00:19:15,866 --> 00:19:23,866
You think that this sister
will lose for sure?

229
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:34,990
Good! Good! Good!

230
00:19:40,825 --> 00:19:48,825
Good! Fantastic! Good!

231
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,532
What style is sister using?
is it Southern Tai Chi?

232
00:19:56,533 --> 00:20:04,533
What technique is this?

233
00:20:10,744 --> 00:20:12,035
Could it be...

234
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:18,159
the rumored secret technique from
Master Zhang San Feng - Silkworm Form?

235
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,577
The form is but the essence isn't.

236
00:20:20,578 --> 00:20:25,784
Silkworm Form?

237
00:20:25,785 --> 00:20:33,785
Good! Great! Good!

238
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,119
Tien Xin won.

239
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,285
Good! Good! Good!

240
00:20:59,286 --> 00:21:00,328
Second match

241
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:03,535
From America's National Taoist
Association, Tang Ning

242
00:21:03,536 --> 00:21:06,989
Daughter, Dad brought you here is just
to broaden your view

243
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:07,954
Don't be too serious.

244
00:21:07,955 --> 00:21:10,329
If you can't win, just admit defeat.

245
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,079
Daddy, my ears are numb.

246
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,412
Then don't use your ears

247
00:21:15,413 --> 00:21:23,413
Just watch my hands.

248
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:45,459
Good! Good! Good!

249
00:22:46,381 --> 00:22:47,804
Tang Ning won

250
00:22:52,459 --> 00:22:55,291
Pain?

251
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:57,834
Bear it for a while.
Daddy will be more gentle

252
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:00,375
Just bear it for a while.

253
00:23:00,376 --> 00:23:03,501
Daddy, did I win beautifully?

254
00:23:03,502 --> 00:23:05,460
You still dare to say

255
00:23:05,461 --> 00:23:07,584
You promised me just to play a while,

256
00:23:07,585 --> 00:23:08,293
then admit defeat

257
00:23:08,294 --> 00:23:09,960
You fought too seriously.

258
00:23:09,961 --> 00:23:12,210
My heart jumps around while watching.

259
00:23:12,211 --> 00:23:13,293
But

260
00:23:13,294 --> 00:23:15,502
Dad, whatever you do,
you are very serious

261
00:23:15,503 --> 00:23:23,503
Why did you tell me not
to be?

262
00:23:23,545 --> 00:23:26,044
It's okay now.

263
00:23:26,045 --> 00:23:27,169
It's getting late.

264
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,335
It's time for Daddy to go to the
male dormitory to rest

265
00:23:30,336 --> 00:23:32,710
Have an early night.

266
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,294
Daddy?

267
00:23:34,295 --> 00:23:42,295
What kind of sickness did Mummy
contract when she left us?

268
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,254
Actually,

269
00:23:44,255 --> 00:23:47,169
I like to know how you and mummy
met each other

270
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,877
Didn't I tell you before?

271
00:23:49,878 --> 00:23:53,170
I used to have a pigtail
during the Ching Dynasty

272
00:23:53,171 --> 00:23:54,545
After that,

273
00:23:54,546 --> 00:23:56,711
I crossed the sea to America,

274
00:23:56,712 --> 00:24:04,671
I met your mother in a Chinese restaurant

275
00:24:04,672 --> 00:24:05,963
We'll talk later.

276
00:24:05,964 --> 00:24:07,754
It's late.

277
00:24:07,755 --> 00:24:10,796
Rest well.

278
00:24:10,797 --> 00:24:15,046
Daddy, you brought the treasure map

279
00:24:15,047 --> 00:24:16,712
Is there a ulterior motive?

280
00:24:16,713 --> 00:24:21,047
Did you really bring me here just
to fight?

281
00:24:21,048 --> 00:24:22,172
I...

282
00:24:22,173 --> 00:24:24,505
brought you here to find you a husband.

283
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:27,255
Daddy, you're crazy.

284
00:24:27,256 --> 00:24:35,256
Oh girl stop trippin...

285
00:24:44,631 --> 00:24:47,630
Golden Hall

286
00:24:47,631 --> 00:24:55,048
Southern Rocks

287
00:24:55,985 --> 00:24:59,632
Dragon Sword with Seven Powers
like a treasure mountain

288
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:03,195
Five Dragon Palace?

289
00:25:20,263 --> 00:25:21,831
Dad.

290
00:25:45,697 --> 00:25:47,707
Your daddy died young

291
00:25:47,242 --> 00:25:51,450
If not, you would be married with kids

292
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:55,095
My health is also not good.

293
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,335
Mum, don't forget

294
00:26:00,336 --> 00:26:02,002
We are at Wudang Mountain,

295
00:26:02,003 --> 00:26:04,544
This is a magical mountain.
With healing powers

296
00:26:04,545 --> 00:26:07,086
Your sickness can certainly be cured.

297
00:26:07,087 --> 00:26:10,002
Now, my only wish is

298
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:13,082
to find you a wife.

299
00:26:14,836 --> 00:26:17,169
Daddy, you promised me

300
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:20,043
that we would be a team in this adventure.

301
00:26:20,044 --> 00:26:25,211
right?

302
00:26:25,212 --> 00:26:33,212
I am not your Dad.

303
00:26:36,546 --> 00:26:37,462
- What is it?
- Nothing, mum!

304
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:38,330
Do not be afraid.
Mum, don't be afraid

305
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:41,878
Who are you?

306
00:26:41,879 --> 00:26:45,294
You again

307
00:26:45,295 --> 00:26:49,169
What! You know her?

308
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,295
She is a guest of Taoist priest Xie.

309
00:26:51,296 --> 00:26:52,879
It's a young woman

310
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,672
Son, you don't have to get ordained.

311
00:26:55,673 --> 00:26:56,839
Lady,

312
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:02,505
are you alright?

313
00:27:02,506 --> 00:27:04,956
Young lady!

314
00:27:46,508 --> 00:27:48,006
Tien Xin,

315
00:27:48,007 --> 00:27:52,423
Tsuen Tien sword is our tribe's
sacred relic

316
00:27:52,424 --> 00:27:55,425
It was forged from asteroid rocks

317
00:27:55,426 --> 00:27:58,174
It has mystical powers.

318
00:27:58,175 --> 00:28:01,675
Your father went to China
to search for the sword

319
00:28:01,676 --> 00:28:04,425
but for many years,
there was no news of him

320
00:28:04,426 --> 00:28:07,341
When we found his body in the desert

321
00:28:07,342 --> 00:28:10,215
his hand was clenching this pearl

322
00:28:10,216 --> 00:28:17,758
It must be connected to the
whereabouts of the sacred sword

323
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:19,800
When you grow up,

324
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:27,801
you must complete your Dad's quest

325
00:28:30,427 --> 00:28:38,427
Thief!

326
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:56,427
There is an accomplice.

327
00:29:28,929 --> 00:29:30,672
Go quickly.

328
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,220
Young lady, you've awakened.

329
00:29:44,221 --> 00:29:45,429
I am very worried

330
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,679
You fell from the roof.

331
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,680
I was afraid that you might be
paralyzed like me

332
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:51,972
I'm so sorry

333
00:29:51,973 --> 00:29:53,346
that I damaged your roof.

334
00:29:53,347 --> 00:29:54,680
My dad will compensate you.

335
00:29:54,681 --> 00:29:55,805
No need to pay.

336
00:29:55,806 --> 00:29:59,014
I've repaired it.

337
00:29:59,015 --> 00:30:01,972
Aren't you the Wudang representative?

338
00:30:01,973 --> 00:30:03,473
I am also a representative

339
00:30:03,474 --> 00:30:05,345
I won today.

340
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:08,014
We might be competing against
each other.

341
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:10,723
I won't go and compete.

342
00:30:10,724 --> 00:30:12,264
Why?

343
00:30:12,265 --> 00:30:14,014
I have to take care of my mother.

344
00:30:14,015 --> 00:30:15,347
Aiya,

345
00:30:15,348 --> 00:30:17,140
hurry up and get married

346
00:30:17,141 --> 00:30:20,056
then you won't have to take care of me.

347
00:30:20,057 --> 00:30:21,556
Young lady

348
00:30:21,557 --> 00:30:23,473
What is your name?

349
00:30:23,474 --> 00:30:24,432
Tang Ning.

350
00:30:24,433 --> 00:30:26,598
Ning Er,

351
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:28,015
this is my son.

352
00:30:28,016 --> 00:30:29,932
he's called Sui He-Yi,

353
00:30:29,933 --> 00:30:32,558
and still not married.

354
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,222
How about you?

355
00:30:34,223 --> 00:30:38,681
Mum, the lady is still young.
Don't scare her.

356
00:30:38,682 --> 00:30:43,890
Not that young..

357
00:30:43,891 --> 00:30:45,265
Mum, have an early night.

358
00:30:45,266 --> 00:30:46,681
Son,

359
00:30:46,682 --> 00:30:50,517
both of you are very compatible.

360
00:30:50,518 --> 00:30:52,683
I'm going to sleep

361
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,184
Get to know each other.

362
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,968
I won't be nosey

363
00:30:55,969 --> 00:31:01,683
Ok, ok, sleep tight.

364
00:31:01,684 --> 00:31:02,933
Lady,

365
00:31:02,934 --> 00:31:04,113
I think you've lost your way

366
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:05,849
Don't always call me lady

367
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:13,850
My name is Tang Ning.

368
00:31:25,101 --> 00:31:26,643
Mosquitoes are pests.

369
00:31:26,644 --> 00:31:30,269
Pest also have a life.
Besides, I've made a wish

370
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,018
that if my mum's illness is cured

371
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:35,602
I won't kill any living thing.

372
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:37,434
When the night comes,
and the weather is cool

373
00:31:37,435 --> 00:31:41,684
there won't be any mosquitoes

374
00:31:41,685 --> 00:31:43,185
Actually, humans

375
00:31:43,186 --> 00:31:45,352
is part of the universe.

376
00:31:45,353 --> 00:31:46,728
Mosquitoes too

377
00:31:46,729 --> 00:31:49,852
All things in the world too.

378
00:31:49,853 --> 00:31:52,479
Lay disciple needs to learn the "way"?

379
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,269
In fact, I'm not the best student.

380
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,519
Taoist priest Xie,

381
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,686
taught me the "Way",
and that all things are one

382
00:31:58,687 --> 00:32:00,519
He taught me meditation

383
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,852
and said we can feel "life"

384
00:32:03,853 --> 00:32:06,728
I am really no good at it.

385
00:32:06,729 --> 00:32:09,544
Can you feel it?

386
00:32:12,855 --> 00:32:18,895
I just felt that,

387
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:21,896
I've got no life now.

388
00:32:31,897 --> 00:32:33,688
It's you

389
00:32:33,689 --> 00:32:36,146
Aren't you the sponsor?

390
00:32:36,147 --> 00:32:38,188
and I have to rescue you

391
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:40,687
If not for me,
you will surely be caught.

392
00:32:40,688 --> 00:32:41,480
Stop boasting

393
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:42,563
I am the one who saved you.

394
00:32:42,564 --> 00:32:44,938
If not for my last attack,
can you escape?

395
00:32:44,939 --> 00:32:46,522
You came here to steal?

396
00:32:46,523 --> 00:32:48,855
The sacred sword belongs to our tribe

397
00:32:48,856 --> 00:32:50,522
I've been searching for it for years.

398
00:32:50,523 --> 00:32:51,772
Then to make it easier.

399
00:32:51,773 --> 00:32:53,272
In total, Wudang has 7 treasures

400
00:32:53,273 --> 00:32:55,315
I have a suggestion.
Let's co-operate.

401
00:32:55,316 --> 00:32:58,521
Once the job is done. The sword belongs to you.
All the rest will belong to me

402
00:32:58,522 --> 00:33:01,980
You tested White Dragon's
prowess earlier on.

403
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:03,725
You won't be able to succeed alone

404
00:33:03,726 --> 00:33:05,023
Let's do it together.
Agreed?

405
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,649
Sure, why not?

406
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,689
But our personalities are different.

407
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,102
I came here to get back what
belongs to me.

408
00:33:11,137 --> 00:33:12,439
You are here to steal.

409
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,689
But when you steal,

410
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,273
why did you bring your daughter here?

411
00:33:15,274 --> 00:33:16,564
What you are doing might cause harm to her.

412
00:33:16,565 --> 00:33:17,607
What did you say?

413
00:33:17,608 --> 00:33:20,689
Killed my daughter?

414
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:22,733
When I just came out,

415
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,442
She thought I was you,

416
00:33:24,443 --> 00:33:25,982
she chased me.

417
00:33:25,983 --> 00:33:29,774
But she fell off the cliff.

418
00:33:29,775 --> 00:33:31,149
But don't worry,

419
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:37,398
I think she is ok...

420
00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:39,024
This is Wudang Mountain,

421
00:33:39,025 --> 00:33:40,107
it has healing energy.

422
00:33:40,108 --> 00:33:41,523
It can cure any disease.

423
00:33:41,524 --> 00:33:42,483
Ning Er!

424
00:33:42,484 --> 00:33:44,525
Ning Er! Ning Er!

425
00:33:44,526 --> 00:33:48,067
Daddy, what happen to you?

426
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:50,359
Are you alright?

427
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,807
Didn't you fell from the cliff?

428
00:33:52,842 --> 00:33:54,609
Yes I did.

429
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:57,402
Fortunately, I used my internal energy to protect myself

430
00:33:56,609 --> 00:33:59,775
Look at me, I'm alright.

431
00:34:00,888 --> 00:34:02,278
You frightened me to death.

432
00:34:11,693 --> 00:34:14,068
Yunnan, Da Mao sect - Liu Kun won.

433
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:15,567
The next match,

434
00:34:15,568 --> 00:34:18,360
Seoul, Chuen Zhen's representative - Li Tsuen De.

435
00:34:18,361 --> 00:34:26,361
His opponent from Shangdong,
Peng Lai sect - Zhang Yang

436
00:34:35,362 --> 00:34:36,902
Li Tsuen De won.

437
00:34:36,903 --> 00:34:38,860
The last match for today,

438
00:34:38,861 --> 00:34:41,070
America's Taoist Association's
representative - Tang Ning

439
00:34:41,071 --> 00:34:43,070
Ning Er, remember what I said.

440
00:34:43,071 --> 00:34:45,180
If you can't win, just admit defeat.

441
00:34:45,215 --> 00:34:48,820
Okay, no problem.

442
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:05,028
I won't give way.

443
00:35:05,029 --> 00:35:06,445
You also do your best.

444
00:35:06,446 --> 00:35:14,446
Don't let your father down.

445
00:35:25,075 --> 00:35:26,105
Come on!

446
00:35:40,366 --> 00:35:42,669
I've lost

447
00:35:45,522 --> 00:35:47,489
Thanks for giving way

448
00:35:48,249 --> 00:35:49,322
Tang Ning won

449
00:35:55,532 --> 00:35:57,030
You are lucky you didn't lose,

450
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:57,864
Where are you going?

451
00:35:57,865 --> 00:35:58,782
It's a secret.

452
00:35:58,783 --> 00:36:00,156
Professor Tang

453
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:01,824
Last night, why did you go up the mountain?

454
00:36:01,825 --> 00:36:03,533
I've got no face to back to
Chiang Dong to see the elders

455
00:36:03,534 --> 00:36:04,900
I'm sorry.
Did I hit you?

456
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:06,199
Miss Tien Xin

457
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,699
Did you have a good sleep last night?

458
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,845
Not at all.
I had a nightmare.

459
00:36:13,825 --> 00:36:20,534
Mum, bear with it.

460
00:36:20,535 --> 00:36:28,535
Sui He-Yi!

461
00:36:29,492 --> 00:36:31,074
Mum, we're reaching.

462
00:36:31,075 --> 00:36:35,950
Bear with it.

463
00:36:35,951 --> 00:36:37,617
If I guess correctly,

464
00:36:37,618 --> 00:36:39,867
the two of us are under
White Dragon's suspicion

465
00:36:39,868 --> 00:36:42,534
That is why in the competition
you deliberately lost the match.

466
00:36:42,535 --> 00:36:44,451
By using daylight for our operation

467
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,118
White Dragon is unable to leave now

468
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:47,535
No time to keep vigil on the sword

469
00:36:47,536 --> 00:36:49,535
We have bigger plans.

470
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,950
We will have to follow the next verse
to get to our next target

471
00:36:51,951 --> 00:36:53,325
Truth Sutra and Heavenly Pill

472
00:36:53,326 --> 00:36:54,158
Hey,

473
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:55,866
Why don't you continue to
get the sacred sword?

474
00:36:55,867 --> 00:36:57,035
I'm not that stupid

475
00:36:57,036 --> 00:36:59,951
Once you've got the sword,
you would leave.

476
00:36:59,952 --> 00:37:01,993
Truth Sutra,

477
00:37:01,994 --> 00:37:04,827
should be the 5,000 verse of the
Dao De Sutra by Lao Tzu

478
00:37:04,828 --> 00:37:06,244
Hidden in Blissful Palace.

479
00:37:06,245 --> 00:37:09,244
Another treasure is the Heavenly Pill.

480
00:37:09,245 --> 00:37:11,743
Made by Taoist Zhang

481
00:37:11,744 --> 00:37:14,420
said to cure all illness.

482
00:37:15,954 --> 00:37:17,994
Hidden in...

483
00:37:17,995 --> 00:37:20,618
Prince hides in the dragon bed

484
00:37:20,619 --> 00:37:22,869
What's so great about it?

485
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,619
Hide the heavenly pill.

486
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,369
Poetry is actually so simple.

487
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,785
Why don't we split up.

488
00:37:28,786 --> 00:37:30,577
OK.

489
00:37:30,578 --> 00:37:32,703
If you think you can act alone...

490
00:37:32,704 --> 00:37:34,703
I have no objection.

491
00:37:34,704 --> 00:37:36,203
You go get the Sutra,

492
00:37:36,204 --> 00:37:37,912
I will go and get the Heavenly Pill.

493
00:37:37,913 --> 00:37:39,621
Why do I have to get the Sutra?

494
00:37:39,622 --> 00:37:40,745
Because I've checked

495
00:37:40,746 --> 00:37:43,454
There are only 2 priest guarding
the Blissful Palace

496
00:37:43,455 --> 00:37:45,912
It's relatively easier to operate.

497
00:37:45,913 --> 00:37:49,328
The biggest mistake of your life
is to underestimate...

498
00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:50,994
I'm just joking with you.

499
00:37:50,995 --> 00:37:52,203
Wu Dang is full of skilled guards

500
00:37:52,204 --> 00:37:54,596
You've better be careful.

501
00:38:02,622 --> 00:38:03,871
Before the sun sets,

502
00:38:03,872 --> 00:38:06,094
we'll see who finishes first.

503
00:38:20,373 --> 00:38:21,788
Mum, you're awake.

504
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:25,621
Mum has woken.

505
00:38:25,622 --> 00:38:29,657
Miss Tang Ning. Miss Tang Ning

506
00:38:29,658 --> 00:38:33,623
Ma'am

507
00:38:33,624 --> 00:38:36,748
All the meridians and channels
in her body are cleared

508
00:38:36,749 --> 00:38:39,715
Only the heart is not cleared

509
00:38:41,708 --> 00:38:45,332
Good, you are cured

510
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:48,998
You can get out of bed
and walk around.

511
00:38:48,999 --> 00:38:50,408
I can get out of bed and walk?

512
00:38:50,409 --> 00:38:51,372
Try it.

513
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:52,332
Mum,

514
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:55,748
Try it, give it a go.

515
00:38:55,749 --> 00:39:00,124
One, two, three.

516
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:01,207
Very good.

517
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:03,457
Mum, you really can walk again.

518
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:04,916
Aiya, I can move.

519
00:39:04,917 --> 00:39:07,707
Sit down first.
Sit down first.

520
00:39:07,708 --> 00:39:08,708
I can really walk.

521
00:39:08,709 --> 00:39:12,166
Thank heaven. When the bad is gone,
fortune will come.

522
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:14,709
Your mother's illness is alright now.

523
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,578
Thank you, head priest.

524
00:39:15,579 --> 00:39:16,457
Thank you.

525
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:19,542
Now you can compete for Wudang
without worries

526
00:39:19,543 --> 00:39:20,833
I...

527
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:24,416
You don't have to be ordained.
Go and compete without worries.

528
00:39:24,417 --> 00:39:27,542
Go and thank the head priest
and show your gratitude

529
00:39:27,543 --> 00:39:29,428
I will.

530
00:41:01,881 --> 00:41:04,046
Who is that?

531
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:05,654
Get him!

532
00:41:10,048 --> 00:41:11,276
Stand still

533
00:42:19,217 --> 00:42:20,675
Please forgive me

534
00:42:20,676 --> 00:42:22,370
Thank you very much.

535
00:42:34,303 --> 00:42:35,469
How are you, head priest.

536
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:39,052
I am a disciple of Si-Yue, Hua Mountain,
Ninth Heavenly Palace.

537
00:42:39,053 --> 00:42:44,677
Is it convenient for us to talk?

538
00:42:44,678 --> 00:42:47,136
Head priest, to tell the truth

539
00:42:47,137 --> 00:42:52,385
The nunnery...

540
00:42:52,386 --> 00:42:56,594
I think the one we had was Ying Sutra
and yours is the Yang Sutra.

541
00:42:56,595 --> 00:42:58,635
I thought since the
Ying Sutra was stolen...

542
00:42:58,636 --> 00:43:02,344
your Yang Sutra might be stolen too...

543
00:43:02,345 --> 00:43:04,887
Haha, you've been fooled.

544
00:43:04,888 --> 00:43:08,927
You've been fooled.

545
00:43:08,928 --> 00:43:10,425
That's it!

546
00:43:20,221 --> 00:43:23,554
Strange.
Not even one Taoist priest

547
00:43:23,555 --> 00:43:31,555
Remember, the preparations for my
my plan will not be in vain

548
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:41,179
The sutra is really hidden here?

549
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,601
I hope it's not a trap

550
00:44:16,682 --> 00:44:18,577
"Dao De Sutra"

551
00:44:24,725 --> 00:44:28,182
What kind of treasure is this?
So easy to get hold of.

552
00:44:28,183 --> 00:44:31,308
My acting and my kung fu
have no usage at all.

553
00:44:31,309 --> 00:44:33,237
Wasted my time practicing

554
00:44:48,476 --> 00:44:49,725
Great bandit, Tang Yun Long

555
00:44:49,726 --> 00:44:50,725
You're late.

556
00:44:50,726 --> 00:44:52,225
You've lost.

557
00:44:52,226 --> 00:44:55,225
Nun Tien Xin, you've won.

558
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:57,475
You are injured.

559
00:44:57,476 --> 00:44:59,893
You are also injured.

560
00:44:59,894 --> 00:45:02,309
The priest you talk about is really skillful

561
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:04,268
I nearly didn't escape.

562
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:06,391
Here!

563
00:45:06,392 --> 00:45:07,267
It's already rusty.

564
00:45:07,268 --> 00:45:09,558
Don't know why it's called a treasure.

565
00:45:11,323 --> 00:45:12,559
Eh, look here.

566
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,225
Let's proceed to our next target.

567
00:45:16,226 --> 00:45:21,102
Outside the cave of the Eight
Meridian hides the black leader.

568
00:45:21,103 --> 00:45:22,685
Didn't you say that poetry is simple?

569
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:25,394
Explain.

570
00:45:25,395 --> 00:45:26,518
It is that simple.

571
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:27,894
Yes...

572
00:45:27,895 --> 00:45:30,894
The eight pulse...

573
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,602
I think that there are 2 treasures.

574
00:45:32,603 --> 00:45:34,477
You see, the Eight Meridian,

575
00:45:34,478 --> 00:45:36,268
Perhaps it's the Eight Meridian in a cave

576
00:45:36,269 --> 00:45:37,602
Black leader...

577
00:45:37,603 --> 00:45:38,686
Maybe the head is pitch black...

578
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:42,020
Black Leader... Shou Wu

579
00:45:42,021 --> 00:45:44,186
Wu Dang Mountain is known for it
fertile land and healing energy

580
00:45:44,187 --> 00:45:47,602
A pair of thousand year old Ho Shou Wu
is growing here

581
00:45:47,603 --> 00:45:49,937
Just a pair?

582
00:45:49,938 --> 00:45:52,228
There are many thousand year old Ho Shou Wu.

583
00:45:52,229 --> 00:45:53,937
and they are husband and wife,

584
00:45:53,938 --> 00:45:55,686
quarreled frequently.

585
00:45:55,687 --> 00:45:56,895
That's why I dislike men,

586
00:45:56,896 --> 00:45:58,687
I still like to be alone.

587
00:45:58,688 --> 00:45:59,896
Women are more troublesome.

588
00:45:59,897 --> 00:46:01,437
I like to be independent.

589
00:46:01,438 --> 00:46:03,937
Right. We will always be on different paths.

590
00:46:03,938 --> 00:46:05,645
After we've stolen the treasures

591
00:46:05,646 --> 00:46:07,312
You can sell them and make money

592
00:46:07,313 --> 00:46:08,742
and I can go home.

593
00:46:08,743 --> 00:46:10,103
I am not the greedy

594
00:46:10,104 --> 00:46:12,875
selfish type, who would die for money

595
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:15,521
Okay, then don't waste my time.

596
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:17,480
Don't think that you are so self-righteous

597
00:46:17,481 --> 00:46:19,848
If you think that the sacred sword
belongs to your tribe,

598
00:46:19,849 --> 00:46:22,355
bring out some proof.

599
00:46:22,356 --> 00:46:24,564
The sword was originally from our tribe.

600
00:46:24,565 --> 00:46:25,688
Proof?

601
00:46:25,689 --> 00:46:29,396
Even if there is no proof.
The sword still belongs to our tribe.

602
00:46:29,397 --> 00:46:30,480
Okay.

603
00:46:30,481 --> 00:46:34,230
Without you, I can still find
the sacred sword.

604
00:46:34,231 --> 00:46:36,450
I will!

605
00:46:43,732 --> 00:46:49,855
Sleeping Kung Fu, is the higher skill for
internal sect of martial arts.

606
00:46:49,856 --> 00:46:52,272
Zhuang Tzu dreamt and became a butterfly

607
00:46:52,273 --> 00:46:55,816
The butterfly dreamt and became Zhuang Tzu.

608
00:46:55,817 --> 00:46:58,732
Grandmaster Chen Chuan slept for 800 years

609
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:01,565
for the youth of Sung Dynasty

610
00:47:01,566 --> 00:47:03,397
Beggar Su Qi Er slept,

611
00:47:03,398 --> 00:47:09,941
and learned Drunken LuoHan Fist.

612
00:47:09,942 --> 00:47:12,607
Close your eyes,

613
00:47:12,608 --> 00:47:15,732
Open your eyes,

614
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:21,733
A day will pass.

615
00:47:21,734 --> 00:47:26,234
Sleep deity. Sleep deity.

616
00:47:26,235 --> 00:47:30,399
When the rock takes hold,
all the years will be forgotten.

617
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,983
The 3 Rays goes deeper,
your nature will be pure.

618
00:47:34,984 --> 00:47:42,359
Breathing and relaxation becomes natural

619
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:47,442
This is Grandmaster Zhang San Feng's
Sleeping Kung Fu's technique

620
00:47:47,443 --> 00:47:51,561
You must always remember it.

621
00:48:11,194 --> 00:48:12,777
Something happened in Crouching Dragon's hall

622
00:48:12,778 --> 00:48:15,027
Head priest have not waken
from his practice

623
00:48:15,028 --> 00:48:15,861
What is it?

624
00:48:15,862 --> 00:48:17,527
The 7 of us pursued him

625
00:48:17,528 --> 00:48:19,903
but he escaped.

626
00:48:19,904 --> 00:48:22,067
Any urgent things that you are seeing
the head priest?

627
00:48:22,102 --> 00:48:23,763
A robber appeared in
Crouching Dragon's hall.

628
00:48:23,714 --> 00:48:24,499
What has been stolen?

629
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,528
Nothing is stolen.

630
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:29,069
The thief is using an incense bag,

631
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:32,206
Took away a ball like object.

632
00:48:33,238 --> 00:48:34,403
Auntie,

633
00:48:34,404 --> 00:48:37,529
Why did you suddenly let Sui He-Yi compete?

634
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:41,070
We are indebted to Head Priest Xie,

635
00:48:41,071 --> 00:48:45,862
Of course we have to return the favor.

636
00:48:45,863 --> 00:48:50,903
Last night, I dreamt that I and
Sui He-Yi was on a Baqua stage,

637
00:48:50,904 --> 00:48:52,238
just like a marriage ceremony.

638
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:54,280
Bowing?

639
00:48:54,281 --> 00:48:57,362
No, no, nothing at all.

640
00:48:57,363 --> 00:48:58,696
Ning Er,

641
00:48:58,697 --> 00:49:06,697
open the box near my bed and have a look.

642
00:49:14,115 --> 00:49:15,780
It's beautiful.

643
00:49:15,781 --> 00:49:18,864
I've never worn such Chinese clothes before.

644
00:49:18,865 --> 00:49:21,657
Quick wear it and have a look.

645
00:49:24,698 --> 00:49:27,405
How does it look?

646
00:49:27,406 --> 00:49:29,905
You've made the right choice.

647
00:49:29,906 --> 00:49:33,948
It is fated.

648
00:49:33,949 --> 00:49:38,031
This is what my mother made for my marriage.

649
00:49:38,032 --> 00:49:46,032
Beautiful. Aiyaa, beautiful.

650
00:50:00,033 --> 00:50:02,448
It seems that I am disturbing your sleep.

651
00:50:02,449 --> 00:50:04,449
Why are you wearing my mother's clothes?

652
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:05,990
She gave it to me.

653
00:50:05,991 --> 00:50:06,740
Beautiful?

654
00:50:06,741 --> 00:50:08,241
It's beautiful.

655
00:50:08,242 --> 00:50:09,409
Where's my mother?

656
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:10,241
She is asleep.

657
00:50:10,242 --> 00:50:11,533
I came here to find you.

658
00:50:11,534 --> 00:50:12,950
I am practicing kung fu here.

659
00:50:12,951 --> 00:50:15,450
Thank you for taking care of my mother.

660
00:50:15,451 --> 00:50:17,242
I'm happy to do it.

661
00:50:17,243 --> 00:50:20,075
Actually, old folks are like children

662
00:50:20,076 --> 00:50:21,826
She listens to my stories.

663
00:50:21,827 --> 00:50:23,949
After a while she fell asleep.

664
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:25,533
You and your mother depended on each other

665
00:50:25,534 --> 00:50:27,449
Me and my father too.

666
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:29,777
These few years, only he taught me martial arts

667
00:50:29,778 --> 00:50:31,325
and how to take care of my body

668
00:50:31,326 --> 00:50:33,118
We’ve done some research,

669
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:37,993
the most scientific way to take care of
the body is the Taoist way

670
00:50:37,994 --> 00:50:40,742
I talk too much.

671
00:50:40,743 --> 00:50:42,110
Don't worry about your mother

672
00:50:42,111 --> 00:50:44,575
I will visit her when I am free.

673
00:50:44,576 --> 00:50:47,158
Stretch out your hand.

674
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:49,744
Close your eyes.

675
00:50:49,745 --> 00:50:51,326
This treasure of mine,

676
00:50:51,327 --> 00:50:54,576
has helped Head Priest Xie.

677
00:50:54,577 --> 00:51:00,410
You can have it.

678
00:51:00,411 --> 00:51:01,702
Why you buggin?

679
00:51:01,703 --> 00:51:03,784
Just a little worm.

680
00:51:03,785 --> 00:51:05,880
Ol scary ass...

681
00:51:05,915 --> 00:51:06,868
Yunnan, Da Mou sect - Liu Kun,

682
00:51:06,869 --> 00:51:08,536
against,

683
00:51:08,537 --> 00:51:12,619
America's Chinese Taoist Association's
Tang Ning.

684
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:13,786
Daughter...

685
00:51:13,787 --> 00:51:17,245
Daddy, with you around,
I am confident.

686
00:51:17,246 --> 00:51:19,412
Tang Yun Long, come with me.

687
00:51:19,413 --> 00:51:21,452
Why? I can't leave.

688
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:24,078
Look over there.

689
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:29,036
They're looking for you.

690
00:51:29,037 --> 00:51:31,829
Don't worry. If I can't win,
I'll just admit defeat

691
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:35,203
You guys go.

692
00:51:35,204 --> 00:51:37,322
Come on.

693
00:52:01,539 --> 00:52:03,830
Boss, Tang Yun Long is over there.

694
00:52:03,831 --> 00:52:04,830
Follow him.

695
00:52:04,831 --> 00:52:07,302
If necessary, kill him.

696
00:52:07,337 --> 00:52:08,351
Yes.

697
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:25,667
I am fine, don't worry.

698
00:52:33,249 --> 00:52:36,025
Most responsible father, wake up!

699
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:38,373
We've been followed.

700
00:52:43,417 --> 00:52:45,416
They are not from Wudang.

701
00:52:45,417 --> 00:52:46,849
Their shoes are not the same

702
00:52:46,884 --> 00:52:49,501
Don't care about them.
Let's go quickly!

703
00:53:01,417 --> 00:53:03,527
Tang Ning won.

704
00:53:09,626 --> 00:53:12,001
I think this is Eight Meridian cave.

705
00:53:12,002 --> 00:53:13,285
There's a lot of people welcoming us.

706
00:53:13,286 --> 00:53:14,584
You sneak in from the Dragon's Head.

707
00:53:14,585 --> 00:53:19,725
We will lure the two groups of people
to the forest on the left.

708
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:53,763
Stop intruder! Stop!

709
00:53:59,128 --> 00:54:07,128
Don't run! Stand still!

710
00:54:20,947 --> 00:54:22,226
Let's go!

711
00:54:27,589 --> 00:54:30,933
It clearly stated that it's Eight Meridian Palace.
Why does it say Eight Meridian Cave?

712
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:33,536
We're in the right place.

713
00:54:37,338 --> 00:54:39,546
This treasure is connected to
the eight meridian

714
00:54:39,547 --> 00:54:42,459
It's only broken idols.
Which is the treasure?

715
00:54:42,494 --> 00:54:45,024
It must be here.
Let's search quickly.

716
00:54:51,089 --> 00:54:54,132
You think you can just walk in here
and take what you want?

717
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:56,369
I've waited for you for a long time.

718
00:54:56,404 --> 00:54:59,499
Professor Tang.

719
00:55:01,532 --> 00:55:02,821
All yours.

720
00:55:02,777 --> 00:55:03,739
Me?

721
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:04,989
If I fight with women,

722
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:06,157
I will definitely be at a disadvantage.

723
00:55:06,158 --> 00:55:07,697
I... I...

724
00:55:07,698 --> 00:55:14,531
I'm the one that tore my own clothes
and pretended I was fighting.

725
00:55:14,532 --> 00:55:16,968
Oh you son of a biscuit eater...

726
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:40,824
Please hurry up, for goodness sake!

727
00:55:40,825 --> 00:55:42,992
Eight Meridian...
is it 8 strings of golden wheat?

728
00:55:42,993 --> 00:55:45,844
Can we get it at the dollar store?

729
00:56:26,035 --> 00:56:27,910
Eight Meridian

730
00:56:27,911 --> 00:56:29,868
It's 7 Channel & 8 Meridian.

731
00:56:29,869 --> 00:56:30,660
Have you found it yet?

732
00:56:30,661 --> 00:56:33,327
Gotcha!

733
00:56:33,328 --> 00:56:40,662
I've found it.

734
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:44,369
Tien Xin

735
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:52,370
I found the golden man.

736
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:59,161
Tang Yun Long
You expected that I'd die?

737
00:56:59,162 --> 00:57:00,829
I am very sorry

738
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:02,829
that I messed up your leg.

739
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:04,995
Know that you owe me a lot.

740
00:57:04,996 --> 00:57:06,538
hand over the golden man

741
00:57:06,539 --> 00:57:10,523
and your backpack.

742
00:57:20,908 --> 00:57:22,168
Get him!

743
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:49,490
Take the golden man and go

744
00:57:49,491 --> 00:57:50,831
I will take care of them

745
00:57:50,832 --> 00:57:52,248
If we go, we'll go together.

746
00:57:52,249 --> 00:58:00,249
If we fight, we fight together.

747
01:01:18,842 --> 01:01:26,842
Be careful.

748
01:01:44,468 --> 01:01:45,467
Your sleep kung fu is so lousy?

749
01:01:45,468 --> 01:01:47,510
You will definitely lose, if you fight.

750
01:01:47,511 --> 01:01:49,817
It's not that sleep kung fu is so lousy,

751
01:01:49,818 --> 01:01:51,926
my intellect is too low

752
01:01:51,927 --> 01:01:53,969
The reason why I am here

753
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:56,810
is to find a cure for my mother.

754
01:01:56,811 --> 01:01:59,176
The worm that you wanted to give me the last time,
do you still want to give it to me?

755
01:01:59,177 --> 01:02:00,176
You're not afraid anymore?

756
01:02:00,177 --> 01:02:03,509
Not anymore.

757
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:06,052
Here!

758
01:02:06,053 --> 01:02:07,343
I'm not afraid...

759
01:02:07,344 --> 01:02:11,677
Is because I know when it grows,
it'll become a butterfly

760
01:02:11,678 --> 01:02:13,553
Now, it can only crawl on the ground

761
01:02:13,554 --> 01:02:15,218
But if it turns into a butterfly,

762
01:02:15,219 --> 01:02:18,446
It can fly in the air.

763
01:02:19,179 --> 01:02:23,095
It's like stepping into another dimension.

764
01:02:23,096 --> 01:02:24,595
Man sleeps and dreams

765
01:02:24,596 --> 01:02:27,470
is also like going into another dimension?

766
01:02:27,471 --> 01:02:28,679
Dreams?

767
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:29,845
Butterflies?

768
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:32,595
Another dimension?

769
01:02:32,596 --> 01:02:35,012
It's like this,

770
01:02:35,013 --> 01:02:37,511
Imagine your mother's illness is cured

771
01:02:37,512 --> 01:02:39,262
and you feel unburdened.

772
01:02:39,263 --> 01:02:43,140
You are like the leaves.

773
01:02:43,141 --> 01:02:47,680
Going where the wind takes you.

774
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:55,681
Free without boundaries.

775
01:03:04,764 --> 01:03:05,805
Thank you.

776
01:03:05,806 --> 01:03:08,514
I felt my heart cleared a lot.

777
01:03:08,515 --> 01:03:14,014
Heaven and man are one!

778
01:03:14,015 --> 01:03:17,389
Such a beautiful leaf.

779
01:03:17,390 --> 01:03:19,014
Let me have a look.

780
01:03:19,015 --> 01:03:21,793
I'm not letting you see.

781
01:03:23,475 --> 01:03:25,432
Brother Sui,

782
01:03:25,433 --> 01:03:29,389
if one is to die,

783
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:34,140
won't it be like sleeping?

784
01:03:34,141 --> 01:03:36,347
What I mean is,

785
01:03:36,348 --> 01:03:38,681
maybe one day,
I'm to leave this world

786
01:03:38,682 --> 01:03:42,759
will we meet in another place?

787
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,308
Young lady, what nonsense are you talking?

788
01:03:44,309 --> 01:03:46,391
I've got a strange sickness

789
01:03:46,392 --> 01:03:48,308
It's genetic

790
01:03:48,309 --> 01:03:50,975
Can't be cured.

791
01:03:50,976 --> 01:03:53,183
My mother and grandmother

792
01:03:53,184 --> 01:03:55,390
died because of this sickness

793
01:03:55,391 --> 01:04:03,100
They died very young.

794
01:04:03,101 --> 01:04:07,225
I'm not afraid of death.

795
01:04:07,226 --> 01:04:09,516
I just hate myself for being useless.

796
01:04:09,517 --> 01:04:11,849
No...

797
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:13,892
You won't die.

798
01:04:13,893 --> 01:04:17,600
You really won't die.

799
01:04:17,601 --> 01:04:20,349
Okay, no more unhappy talk.

800
01:04:20,350 --> 01:04:22,685
Now, when I am healthy

801
01:04:22,686 --> 01:04:25,185
I have a great desire.

802
01:04:25,186 --> 01:04:26,684
Tomorrow's final match,

803
01:04:26,685 --> 01:04:28,226
I want to have a good match with you.

804
01:04:28,227 --> 01:04:31,862
Just like me and my classmates,
attending a graduation ceremony.

805
01:04:31,863 --> 01:04:33,460
Ok?

806
01:04:33,461 --> 01:04:35,758
Ok.

807
01:04:35,759 --> 01:04:39,055
Man of your words
You have to keep your word.

808
01:04:39,056 --> 01:04:47,056
Liars are dogs!

809
01:04:56,519 --> 01:04:58,477
Do you know that
there are 3 treasure mountains?

810
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:00,035
The fourth verse is 'thunder and fire'

811
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:02,019
should be Thunder and Fire hall.

812
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:04,519
In the dancing clouds,
must be 'Music and Dance'

813
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:07,186
If "Between the Dancing Clouds" means
the golden top of Cloud Sea

814
01:05:07,187 --> 01:05:11,524
Take a look.

815
01:05:11,525 --> 01:05:13,978
The North Star & Seven Constellation

816
01:05:13,979 --> 01:05:15,686
Outside the cave of the Eight
Meridian hides the black leader.

817
01:05:15,687 --> 01:05:17,437
This place is outside the Eight Meridian Cave

818
01:05:17,438 --> 01:05:20,562
and where Ho Shou Wu grows the most lush.

819
01:05:20,563 --> 01:05:22,605
Isn't Ho Shou Wu the treasure?

820
01:05:22,606 --> 01:05:25,854
How can the treasure
be found all over the mountain?

821
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:27,728
Are you Ho Shou Wu?

822
01:05:27,729 --> 01:05:30,812
Are you?

823
01:05:30,813 --> 01:05:34,437
Actually, what we are finding is
the ground of Wudang's spirit.

824
01:05:34,438 --> 01:05:36,978
Legend has it that it sticks to
the roots of Ho Shou Wu

825
01:05:36,979 --> 01:05:40,355
just like the veins of the human body.
Likewise, connecting to every mountain in Wudang.

826
01:05:40,356 --> 01:05:41,855
What's more magical,

827
01:05:41,856 --> 01:05:43,391
they can sense the human heart

828
01:05:43,392 --> 01:05:45,147
change into human shape.

829
01:05:45,148 --> 01:05:47,105
But,

830
01:05:47,106 --> 01:05:48,521
do you feel that,

831
01:05:48,522 --> 01:05:51,287
we got hold of these treasures too easily?

832
01:05:51,288 --> 01:05:53,520
furthermore, our treasure maps are identical

833
01:05:53,521 --> 01:05:55,146
That is why...

834
01:05:55,147 --> 01:05:57,813
you suspect that the map...

835
01:05:57,814 --> 01:05:59,898
Maybe, I'm too suspicious

836
01:05:59,899 --> 01:06:02,689
I've lost confidence in man
and lots of things

837
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:06,439
At least you believe that the
heavenly pill can resurrect the dead

838
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,231
I'm researching science,

839
01:06:08,232 --> 01:06:11,397
don't believe what that cannot be
scientifically proven.

840
01:06:11,398 --> 01:06:12,730
But later I discover

841
01:06:12,731 --> 01:06:16,023
that many things can't be explained with science

842
01:06:16,024 --> 01:06:21,023
and many sickness that cannot be
treated with science

843
01:06:21,024 --> 01:06:23,523
I really want to find the spirit
of the Ho Shou Wu

844
01:06:23,524 --> 01:06:27,940
but there are no leads.

845
01:06:27,941 --> 01:06:29,308
Didn't you just said that Ho Shou Wu

846
01:06:29,309 --> 01:06:31,023
can sense the heart of man?

847
01:06:31,024 --> 01:06:33,731
You can try use your heart to find it.

848
01:06:33,732 --> 01:06:35,523
This is after all a myth.

849
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:36,942
But you said earlier,

850
01:06:36,943 --> 01:06:43,447
There are many things that science
cannot explain.

851
01:06:43,448 --> 01:06:45,525
North Star and the 7 Constellation

852
01:06:45,526 --> 01:06:49,567
I remembered what my grandfather told me

853
01:06:49,568 --> 01:06:51,482
Every time a family member leaves

854
01:06:51,483 --> 01:06:53,524
They will turn into a star

855
01:06:53,525 --> 01:06:58,442
To protect the people they love.

856
01:06:58,443 --> 01:07:00,108
So when I have a wish,

857
01:07:00,109 --> 01:07:03,526
I wish upon the stars.

858
01:07:03,527 --> 01:07:11,527
Please try it.

859
01:07:50,028 --> 01:07:52,569
It really appears.

860
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:55,804
An honest heart makes the spirit appear.

861
01:08:12,404 --> 01:08:14,863
It's written in the Trees and Grass log,

862
01:08:14,864 --> 01:08:17,322
that red is the female and
white is the male

863
01:08:17,323 --> 01:08:22,041
Can't imagine that a husband and wife
pair appears.

864
01:08:37,596 --> 01:08:39,496
Caught them!

865
01:08:56,367 --> 01:08:57,739
Smells good.

866
01:08:57,740 --> 01:09:01,198
Ning Er, you've arrived.

867
01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:03,447
Where is Brother Sui?

868
01:09:03,448 --> 01:09:11,448
He went to pick firewood.

869
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:17,865
Heavenly Emperor, please bless

870
01:09:17,866 --> 01:09:21,156
bless Ning Er's sickness
will soon be cured.

871
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,865
I am willing to have her

872
01:09:22,866 --> 01:09:25,490
sickness instead of her.

873
01:09:25,491 --> 01:09:28,697
I beg you.

874
01:09:55,169 --> 01:09:57,618
Hungry? Let's go.

875
01:10:19,285 --> 01:10:21,952
I came to find my father,
Professor Tang Yun Long.

876
01:10:21,953 --> 01:10:24,368
Can you ask him to come out for a while?

877
01:10:24,369 --> 01:10:26,160
We are also looking for him.

878
01:10:26,161 --> 01:10:27,410
Please go back to your bedroom.

879
01:10:27,411 --> 01:10:35,411
Don't come out.

880
01:10:43,703 --> 01:10:47,036
Your father won't come back tonight.

881
01:10:47,037 --> 01:10:48,412
He is alright.

882
01:10:48,413 --> 01:10:50,637
He is just afraid
that you might be worried

883
01:10:50,672 --> 01:10:53,161
That's why he asked me to come
and see you.

884
01:10:53,162 --> 01:10:54,704
I know.

885
01:10:54,705 --> 01:10:58,037
I'll take good care of myself.

886
01:10:58,038 --> 01:10:59,912
Sister Tien Xin,

887
01:10:59,913 --> 01:11:02,371
I'm really lucky.

888
01:11:02,372 --> 01:11:04,870
Tomorrow, I will be in the finals.

889
01:11:04,871 --> 01:11:06,757
Daddy...

890
01:11:09,373 --> 01:11:15,871
can he come and watch?

891
01:11:15,872 --> 01:11:19,674
Ning Er,

892
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:22,371
Your daddy is stealing the treasures
to save your life.

893
01:11:22,372 --> 01:11:25,913
Do you know that?

894
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:28,331
I know.

895
01:11:28,332 --> 01:11:29,831
Now,

896
01:11:29,832 --> 01:11:33,414
A lot of priests are looking for him.

897
01:11:33,415 --> 01:11:37,872
My father is a great person.

898
01:11:37,873 --> 01:11:41,455
But this time

899
01:11:41,456 --> 01:11:49,456
He steals from others,
all because of me

900
01:12:02,166 --> 01:12:03,540
Sleep well,

901
01:12:03,541 --> 01:12:05,709
you have a match tomorrow.

902
01:12:05,710 --> 01:12:09,792
I'm scared...

903
01:12:11,027 --> 01:12:17,124
Do you believe in miracles?

904
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:18,457
Before,

905
01:12:18,458 --> 01:12:20,708
I always thought,

906
01:12:20,709 --> 01:12:23,125
if you only have faith,

907
01:12:23,126 --> 01:12:25,834
and with hope in the heart,

908
01:12:25,835 --> 01:12:29,792
Then I will have a good life.

909
01:12:29,793 --> 01:12:32,208
Now I discovered,

910
01:12:32,209 --> 01:12:36,959
you can't change reality
with faith and hope.

911
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,208
Sister Tien Xin,

912
01:12:39,209 --> 01:12:42,212
look at my dad...

913
01:12:42,213 --> 01:12:47,294
He don't believe in miracles before

914
01:12:47,295 --> 01:12:50,084
but now he does because of me.

915
01:12:50,085 --> 01:12:52,210
You...

916
01:12:52,211 --> 01:12:55,751
are a little girl living a hard life

917
01:12:55,752 --> 01:12:58,042
Just like your dad.

918
01:12:58,043 --> 01:13:00,210
He's actually hiding...

919
01:13:00,211 --> 01:13:02,293
but in front of you

920
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:05,294
he had to act nonchalant and smile.

921
01:13:05,295 --> 01:13:08,460
Sister Tien Xin,

922
01:13:08,461 --> 01:13:11,835
can you do me a favor?

923
01:13:11,836 --> 01:13:15,210
Help me realize my last wish.

924
01:13:15,211 --> 01:13:18,002
Don't say sad things.

925
01:13:18,003 --> 01:13:19,043
You just have to keep on living

926
01:13:19,044 --> 01:13:21,460
and I'll help you with anything.

927
01:13:21,461 --> 01:13:23,712
You have to keep your word.

928
01:13:23,713 --> 01:13:28,712
Get married to my dad.

929
01:13:28,713 --> 01:13:30,753
After my mother died

930
01:13:30,754 --> 01:13:32,254
my dad...

931
01:13:32,255 --> 01:13:34,712
seldom smiled.

932
01:13:34,713 --> 01:13:36,712
But I can tell,

933
01:13:36,713 --> 01:13:39,211
when you are with him

934
01:13:39,212 --> 01:13:43,045
He is very happy.

935
01:13:43,046 --> 01:13:44,713
See...

936
01:13:44,714 --> 01:13:47,379
I hate to be tied down.

937
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:55,380
I can't help you with this.

938
01:13:55,422 --> 01:13:58,224
I'm frightened...

939
01:13:58,225 --> 01:14:00,713
maybe one day,

940
01:14:00,714 --> 01:14:04,839
only my daddy will be left in this world

941
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,463
I really...

942
01:14:06,464 --> 01:14:11,046
I really don't want to
abandon him

943
01:14:11,047 --> 01:14:17,714
You are crying again?
Poor child...

944
01:14:17,715 --> 01:14:25,715
Your dad won't be left alone, ok?

945
01:14:37,631 --> 01:14:45,631
"Golden Hall"

946
01:14:51,049 --> 01:14:53,091
Great master,

947
01:14:53,092 --> 01:14:54,299
indeed,

948
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:56,091
they hide in high places,

949
01:14:56,092 --> 01:15:01,716
where they can be found.

950
01:15:01,717 --> 01:15:03,842
We'll talk after we go down the mountain.

951
01:15:03,843 --> 01:15:05,341
Go down the mountain?

952
01:15:05,342 --> 01:15:08,550
I just climbed up!

953
01:15:08,551 --> 01:15:11,507
Tang Yun Long and
the girl have disappeared.

954
01:15:11,508 --> 01:15:15,218
Do you think they've taken
the treasures and ran off?

955
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:19,330
His daughter is here.
He can't run away

956
01:15:19,365 --> 01:15:23,675
I say we kill Tang Yun Long,
take a couple treasures, that will be enough.

957
01:15:23,718 --> 01:15:26,468
The 7 treasures have to be
gathered together at the same time

958
01:15:26,469 --> 01:15:31,912
it's value weighs more than power and riches.

959
01:15:33,218 --> 01:15:35,341
The treasure map that we created,

960
01:15:35,342 --> 01:15:37,550
and distributed to the world.

961
01:15:37,551 --> 01:15:39,885
Not only attracts Tang Yun Long,

962
01:15:39,886 --> 01:15:42,051
and the thing that has been
missing for many years,

963
01:15:42,052 --> 01:15:49,469
Stilling Wind Pearl.

964
01:15:49,470 --> 01:15:51,053
Brother Sui,

965
01:15:51,054 --> 01:15:54,552
Today we can finally stand here together.

966
01:15:54,553 --> 01:15:56,052
Ning Er,

967
01:15:56,053 --> 01:15:58,344
Can we not fight?

968
01:15:58,345 --> 01:16:00,720
I'll admit defeat.

969
01:16:00,721 --> 01:16:02,605
You promised me.

970
01:16:02,606 --> 01:16:04,469
Man of your words

971
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:06,401
You have to keep your word.

972
01:16:06,402 --> 01:16:14,402
Liars are dogs

973
01:16:31,345 --> 01:16:39,345
Don't, don't...

974
01:17:08,264 --> 01:17:11,722
Don't fight anymore.

975
01:17:11,723 --> 01:17:13,805
Ning Er.

976
01:17:13,806 --> 01:17:15,681
In the ring...

977
01:17:15,682 --> 01:17:18,307
if I can stand for one more minute

978
01:17:18,308 --> 01:17:26,308
I'll live for one minute more.

979
01:17:30,265 --> 01:17:34,015
Fight

980
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:35,516
Let's fight.

981
01:17:35,517 --> 01:17:43,517
OK.

982
01:18:34,103 --> 01:18:35,602
It is clearly a stone sword.

983
01:18:35,603 --> 01:18:38,386
Why call it a sacred sword?

984
01:18:45,686 --> 01:18:47,102
a very mysterious magnetic mineral.

985
01:18:47,103 --> 01:18:49,228
There is nothing like it on earth.

986
01:18:49,229 --> 01:18:57,229
Pardon me.

987
01:19:17,104 --> 01:19:18,312
Look!

988
01:19:18,313 --> 01:19:21,687
This is the symbol of our tribe.

989
01:19:30,313 --> 01:19:32,557
Now we go to Golden Peak Hall
to take the Thunder Needle

990
01:19:32,558 --> 01:19:34,563
the only thing left is the
Stilling Wind Pearl.

991
01:19:34,564 --> 01:19:35,563
Don't go just yet.

992
01:19:35,564 --> 01:19:37,182
I heard that the Thunder Needle
will invoke thunder

993
01:19:37,183 --> 01:19:38,451
Very dangerous.

994
01:19:38,452 --> 01:19:42,104
Thunder Needle is to attract electricity
from the thunder and disperse it into the ground

995
01:19:42,105 --> 01:19:43,772
That is why, gold from the Golden Hall

996
01:19:43,773 --> 01:19:45,356
for 500 years have been having
thunder and lightning,

997
01:19:45,357 --> 01:19:47,647
It still remains intact.

998
01:19:47,648 --> 01:19:49,791
You've got the sacred sword

999
01:19:49,792 --> 01:19:52,689
You intent to go home now?

1000
01:19:52,690 --> 01:19:54,731
I'll definitely take the sacred sword home.

1001
01:19:54,732 --> 01:19:56,772
But not now...

1002
01:19:56,773 --> 01:19:58,563
I promised Ning Er

1003
01:19:58,564 --> 01:20:02,397
I'll wait for her sickness to
be cured first

1004
01:20:02,398 --> 01:20:04,356
She already knows...

1005
01:20:04,357 --> 01:20:06,175
Hmm.

1006
01:20:06,176 --> 01:20:07,147
I thought I can hide it from her

1007
01:20:07,148 --> 01:20:09,731
and let her live happily while
she is still alive.

1008
01:20:09,732 --> 01:20:11,565
That's why, even though her sickness
has worsened,

1009
01:20:11,566 --> 01:20:12,982
she still kept it from you.

1010
01:20:12,983 --> 01:20:15,607
and let you be happier.

1011
01:20:15,608 --> 01:20:23,608
Ning Er is an understanding child.

1012
01:20:29,817 --> 01:20:33,399
Bring the golden needle here.

1013
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,192
Ning Er.

1014
01:20:35,193 --> 01:20:37,274
Taoist Xie.

1015
01:20:37,275 --> 01:20:38,900
This is not internal injury

1016
01:20:38,901 --> 01:20:40,641
It's a strange sickness.

1017
01:20:40,642 --> 01:20:42,399
Pulses are in disarray.

1018
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,899
Internal organs are bleeding.

1019
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:46,566
Taoist Xie,

1020
01:20:46,567 --> 01:20:48,776
Even my mother's sickness can be cured.

1021
01:20:48,777 --> 01:20:51,401
You certainly have a way to
cure Ning Er.

1022
01:20:51,402 --> 01:20:53,733
In luck there is a high and a low,

1023
01:20:53,734 --> 01:20:58,442
There is also long and short life.

1024
01:20:58,443 --> 01:21:00,067
Ning Er

1025
01:21:00,068 --> 01:21:02,234
Ning Er!

1026
01:21:02,235 --> 01:21:06,526
Ning Er.

1027
01:21:06,527 --> 01:21:07,359
Dad is here.

1028
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:08,902
Dad.

1029
01:21:08,903 --> 01:21:10,235
Ning Er.

1030
01:21:10,236 --> 01:21:13,568
This time I did listen to you

1031
01:21:13,569 --> 01:21:15,068
I've lost the match.

1032
01:21:15,069 --> 01:21:18,777
From now on...

1033
01:21:18,778 --> 01:21:20,902
Don't you have the heavenly pill
that can resurrect the dead?

1034
01:21:20,903 --> 01:21:23,818
What are you thinking about?

1035
01:21:23,819 --> 01:21:25,610
But the 7 treasures are incomplete

1036
01:21:25,611 --> 01:21:26,936
I don't know if it's effective.

1037
01:21:26,937 --> 01:21:28,141
Don't think so much!

1038
01:21:28,142 --> 01:21:33,392
Just try it!
Quick!

1039
01:21:33,393 --> 01:21:34,318
Tang Yun Long!

1040
01:21:34,319 --> 01:21:36,444
You really came back for your daughter.

1041
01:21:36,445 --> 01:21:38,902
It's time to settle our debt.

1042
01:21:38,903 --> 01:21:41,403
Let me save my daughter first...

1043
01:21:41,404 --> 01:21:43,277
All the treasures are mine!

1044
01:21:43,278 --> 01:21:44,861
Throw the treasures over here.

1045
01:21:44,862 --> 01:21:47,028
Or else I'll kill your daughter first.

1046
01:21:47,029 --> 01:21:55,029
Hurry up!

1047
01:22:04,904 --> 01:22:06,571
Still missing this?

1048
01:22:06,572 --> 01:22:07,904
Am I right?

1049
01:22:07,905 --> 01:22:09,822
White Dragon

1050
01:22:09,823 --> 01:22:11,987
Thunder Needle is a sacred relic
of Golden Peak.

1051
01:22:11,988 --> 01:22:14,569
You're crazy!

1052
01:22:16,572 --> 01:22:18,738
I'm not crazy.

1053
01:22:18,739 --> 01:22:21,404
Everything goes according to my plan.

1054
01:22:21,405 --> 01:22:23,738
This is destiny.

1055
01:22:23,739 --> 01:22:26,905
This is what 'Heaven and Man are One'
really means.

1056
01:22:26,906 --> 01:22:28,571
You want to become the head priest

1057
01:22:28,572 --> 01:22:33,322
you won't have long to wait.

1058
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:36,073
Do you really think I want
to be the head priest?

1059
01:22:36,074 --> 01:22:44,074
Aiya, you really underestimated me.

1060
01:22:49,407 --> 01:22:57,407
The only thing missing from
the Wudang Treasures...

1061
01:22:58,198 --> 01:23:00,532
I've planned for so many years

1062
01:23:00,533 --> 01:23:03,823
just so that someone would send the
Stilling Wind Pearl back to me.

1063
01:23:03,824 --> 01:23:06,074
That's the necklace that grandfather
gave it to me.

1064
01:23:06,075 --> 01:23:07,740
It's really the Stilling Wind Pearl?

1065
01:23:07,741 --> 01:23:12,157
Back then, your father, Tien-Yu and I
came to Wu Dang,

1066
01:23:12,158 --> 01:23:18,739
To retrieve the sacred relic,
Tsuen Tien Sacred Sword

1067
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:21,573
Half way he discovered the secret

1068
01:23:21,574 --> 01:23:25,325
that I want to collect the 7 treasures
is to achieve Nirvana.

1069
01:23:25,326 --> 01:23:27,574
That's why he stole the Stilling Wind Pearl

1070
01:23:27,575 --> 01:23:31,075
To spoil my plan.

1071
01:23:31,076 --> 01:23:32,741
But,

1072
01:23:32,742 --> 01:23:34,951
he did not realize,

1073
01:23:34,952 --> 01:23:39,076
that I've actually collected 6 Treasures.

1074
01:23:39,077 --> 01:23:41,075
Finally,

1075
01:23:41,076 --> 01:23:45,076
I just used a shoddy map

1076
01:23:45,077 --> 01:23:47,410
to let her daughter

1077
01:23:47,411 --> 01:23:50,461
to bring back the Stilling Wind Pearl.

1078
01:23:50,462 --> 01:23:53,909
To reach nirvana takes practice.

1079
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:55,159
White Dragon

1080
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:58,303
what you're doing is demonic.

1081
01:24:27,662 --> 01:24:30,369
Ning Er is dying.

1082
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:34,619
Ning Er.

1083
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:37,412
I'm frightened...

1084
01:24:37,413 --> 01:24:39,996
Don't be afraid.

1085
01:24:42,539 --> 01:24:45,453
7 Treasures put together,

1086
01:24:45,454 --> 01:24:49,246
I can finally attain Nirvana.

1087
01:24:49,247 --> 01:24:52,121
7 Treasures are leaving the mountain

1088
01:24:52,122 --> 01:24:54,412
Yin and Yang have lost its balance.

1089
01:24:54,413 --> 01:24:57,912
I dreamt of Wudang's disaster

1090
01:24:57,913 --> 01:25:00,788
It has really come.

1091
01:25:00,789 --> 01:25:03,080
No one can stop me anymore.

1092
01:25:03,081 --> 01:25:05,539
Heavenly Pill in orbit,

1093
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:08,163
will be completed in time.

1094
01:25:08,164 --> 01:25:10,038
Very soon,

1095
01:25:10,039 --> 01:25:18,039
I will attain nirvana.

1096
01:25:19,831 --> 01:25:21,038
Taoist Xie,

1097
01:25:21,039 --> 01:25:22,290
Ning Er can't hang on much longer.

1098
01:25:22,291 --> 01:25:24,455
We have to quickly snatch back
the Heavenly Pill.

1099
01:25:24,456 --> 01:25:26,664
The highest stage of Sleep Kung Fu is

1100
01:25:26,665 --> 01:25:28,414
"Body without Attachment"

1101
01:25:28,415 --> 01:25:30,415
Spirit becomes nothingness.

1102
01:25:30,416 --> 01:25:33,414
just like the state White Dragon
is in now.

1103
01:25:33,415 --> 01:25:36,919
[In an Altered State of pure Emptiness]

1104
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:47,582
White Dragon,

1105
01:25:47,583 --> 01:25:50,097
no one ever dare to fool me before!

1106
01:25:50,098 --> 01:25:55,124
We'll have to get the Heavenly Pill back

1107
01:25:55,125 --> 01:26:03,125
Do you want to take a risk
and try?

1108
01:26:14,824 --> 01:26:17,916
Sleep Deity, Sleep Deity.

1109
01:26:17,917 --> 01:26:20,876
When the rock takes hold,
all the years will be forgotten..

1110
01:26:20,877 --> 01:26:26,502
The 3 Rays goes deeper,
your nature will be pure.

1111
01:26:26,503 --> 01:26:34,503
Breathing and relaxation becomes natural.

1112
01:26:51,377 --> 01:26:59,377
Taoist priest!

1113
01:27:44,213 --> 01:27:52,213
Quick, use the Heavenly Pill
to save Ning Er.

1114
01:31:28,476 --> 01:31:31,766
Mere mortals!

1115
01:31:31,767 --> 01:31:36,168
How can you compete with me!

1116
01:33:27,649 --> 01:33:28,855
Daughter

1117
01:33:33,108 --> 01:33:42,000
Daddy! Daddy...
Daddy...

1118
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:43,482
Ning Er

1119
01:33:45,730 --> 01:33:47,043
It's alright now.

1120
01:33:48,804 --> 01:33:51,746
Tien Xin.

1121
01:33:55,388 --> 01:33:57,606
Tang Yun Lon

1122
01:33:57,607 --> 01:34:01,022
You are a tough man,

1123
01:34:01,023 --> 01:34:04,273
but once mention about your daughter,

1124
01:34:04,274 --> 01:34:07,649
you became soft.

1125
01:34:07,650 --> 01:34:15,650
Sister Tien Xin,

1126
01:34:25,526 --> 01:34:28,775
Sacred Sword

1127
01:34:28,776 --> 01:34:36,776
Let it remain in Wudang Mountain.

1128
01:34:37,110 --> 01:34:41,151
I have no need to go home now.

1129
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:43,234
Because the sacred sword

1130
01:34:43,235 --> 01:34:47,110
has its own home now.

1131
01:34:47,111 --> 01:34:48,609
My heart,

1132
01:34:48,610 --> 01:34:53,944
also have a home now.

1133
01:34:53,945 --> 01:34:55,441
Thank you...

1134
01:34:55,442 --> 01:34:56,817
guys.

1135
01:34:56,818 --> 01:35:00,443
Sister Tien Xin

1136
01:35:00,444 --> 01:35:03,318
Sister Tien Xin.

1137
01:35:03,319 --> 01:35:14,319
Sister Tien Xin

1138
01:35:15,288 --> 01:35:17,443
Shortly ago, it was just a treasure quest.

1139
01:35:18,348 --> 01:35:20,308
What treasure map?

1140
01:35:20,837 --> 01:35:22,136
She came to steal the sacred sword?

1141
01:35:22,171 --> 01:35:23,778
The sacred sword originally belongs to our tribe.

1142
01:35:23,779 --> 01:35:26,944
The biggest mistake in your life
is to underestimate...

1143
01:35:27,699 --> 01:35:28,935
I am just joking.

1144
01:35:28,970 --> 01:35:30,733
Wudang have many skilled pugilists.

1145
01:35:30,768 --> 01:35:32,873
You've better be careful.

1146
01:35:36,164 --> 01:35:38,652
I remembered grandfather once told me,

1147
01:35:38,653 --> 01:35:41,278
Whenever a person leaves,

1148
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:44,487
They will turn into a star.

1149
01:35:44,488 --> 01:35:48,554
To protect the ones they love.

1150
01:37:06,999 --> 01:37:08,111
Sister Tien Xin.
