5
00:00:31,942 --> 00:00:32,818
Hi Joe.

6
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:33,901
Hi James.

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,152
Where are you going?

8
00:00:35,652 --> 00:00:37,775
Daddy, I've seen your photo.

9
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:39,776
You've kept pigtail before?

10
00:00:40,817 --> 00:00:43,359
When I was in the U.S. studying,
it was still in the Ching Dynasty

11
00:00:43,568 --> 00:00:46,443
But after the revolution, the government
ordered everyone to cut their pigtails

12
00:00:46,693 --> 00:00:48,401
But many, who are very conservative,

13
00:00:48,525 --> 00:00:50,861
are unable to accept the
change of government

14
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:53,818
But now we are going to Wu Dang Mountain,

15
00:00:54,235 --> 00:00:55,942
and after 2 hours the
train will start rolling,

16
00:00:55,943 --> 00:00:57,360
but why do we still come to Shanghai?

17
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,902
Because we came back to China to
find the things that we want

18
00:00:59,903 --> 00:01:02,610
It is rumoured to be here,
therefore I am going to have a look

19
00:01:06,443 --> 00:01:08,860
Daddy, what is so important?

20
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:10,902
Wait for me here.

21
00:01:11,153 --> 00:01:11,902
I'll be back soon.

22
00:01:12,778 --> 00:01:13,986
Wang, take care good care of her.

23
00:01:14,278 --> 00:01:15,528
Didn't we agree that this time

24
00:01:15,653 --> 00:01:16,903
you won't leave me alone?

25
00:01:17,153 --> 00:01:18,777
Don't worry

26
00:01:19,153 --> 00:01:21,486
From now on, Daddy will not
leave you alone again

27
00:01:37,237 --> 00:01:39,152
Tang Yun Long, Professor Tang?

28
00:01:39,153 --> 00:01:39,953
Hmm

29
00:01:40,029 --> 00:01:40,829
Please.

30
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:01,697
Professor Tang

31
00:02:01,864 --> 00:02:03,862
Thank you for
coming to do the examination

32
00:02:04,029 --> 00:02:05,030
Your Lordship, you are too kind

33
00:02:05,362 --> 00:02:06,821
I've researched this
treasure for many years

34
00:02:07,405 --> 00:02:08,572
and today I can see it with my own eyes

35
00:02:08,697 --> 00:02:10,072
which I consider very fortunate

36
00:02:11,614 --> 00:02:12,613
Professor Tang

37
00:02:13,156 --> 00:02:14,406
I've long since heard your name

38
00:02:15,156 --> 00:02:16,655
You too, Mr. Paul Chen

39
00:02:17,031 --> 00:02:20,032
You've combed and searched all the rare treasure
in China and you are very famous overseas

40
00:02:20,697 --> 00:02:24,032
I've never thought that this mysterious
Tsuen Tien Sword is in your hand

41
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:31,866
This Tsuen Tien Sword has a
history of 2,000 years

42
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,614
Legend has it that the might of the
Tang Dynasty's greatness

43
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,406
it's all because of this
sword's mysterious power

44
00:02:38,614 --> 00:02:39,365
Professor Tang

45
00:02:39,573 --> 00:02:40,115
Please.

46
00:03:06,325 --> 00:03:08,742
Asteroid rocks is used to make this sword

47
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:10,283
It has unique quality and power

48
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,367
Originally it was from a mysterious tribe

49
00:03:13,908 --> 00:03:16,700
After the tribe was perished in a war,
the sword disappeared

50
00:03:16,867 --> 00:03:19,700
I've heard that it appeared
in Wu Dang Mountain once

51
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:21,284
Your Lordship

52
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,534
This sword is

53
00:03:22,908 --> 00:03:24,409
USD $300,000

54
00:03:25,368 --> 00:03:27,160
In future, when you've
regained your country

55
00:03:27,577 --> 00:03:28,452
The reward

56
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:30,618
won't be just USD $300,000

57
00:03:34,951 --> 00:03:35,909
Professor Tang

58
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,576
Professor Tang

59
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:41,367
Dragon Sword with Seven Powers
just like the treasure mountain

60
00:03:41,618 --> 00:03:43,576
The true sutra gives freedom
to the heavenly pill

61
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:46,036
Outside the cave of the Eight
Meridian hides the black leader.

62
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:48,036
The Fiery Pearl in between the Clouds.

63
00:03:50,202 --> 00:03:52,452
It seems that the myth is true

64
00:03:53,036 --> 00:03:55,620
The magical sword is one
of the seven treasures

65
00:03:56,535 --> 00:03:57,703
What did you just said?

66
00:03:58,161 --> 00:03:59,201
Seven Treasures?

67
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:03,161
Maybe...

68
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,661
Maybe this is a treasure map?

69
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,703
Tang Yun Long!
What tricks are you up to?

70
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:18,870
Tricks?
You're the one playing trick

71
00:04:19,537 --> 00:04:22,370
This so called Tsuen Tien Sword is a fake!

72
00:04:23,371 --> 00:04:25,537
Paul Chen! Fake white man!

73
00:04:25,746 --> 00:04:26,911
How dare you cheat me!

74
00:04:26,912 --> 00:04:28,913
How do I know if the two
of you are not in cahoots?

75
00:04:29,205 --> 00:04:30,621
I don't care whether you buy or not,

76
00:04:30,912 --> 00:04:32,621
the person you've brought
has broken my sword

77
00:04:32,913 --> 00:04:34,078
You will have to pay!

78
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,875
Get the map back! Get the map back!

79
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:04,459
Wang, start the car!

80
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,875
Daddy, you've been fighting?

81
00:06:07,876 --> 00:06:10,626
I am alright.
To the train station. Quick!

82
00:06:26,876 --> 00:06:30,501
Men went to battle at the border

83
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:36,043
Woman weaving in the home land

84
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:40,461
Farming in the day
Spinning wool in the night

85
00:06:40,878 --> 00:06:44,628
Don't know if it's night or day,
will still get the job done

86
00:06:45,128 --> 00:06:49,045
The warriors will have food and clothing

87
00:06:49,378 --> 00:06:51,627
If you don't believe

88
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:53,377
Just look at the body

89
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,877
Our shoes and socks

90
00:06:56,002 --> 00:06:57,711
and our pants and shirts

91
00:06:58,504 --> 00:06:59,088
Miss

92
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,212
I noticed that you have been looking at me

93
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:02,545
Do you think

94
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:04,545
I have been idolizing you?

95
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,213
Are you a representative of Bei Ping

96
00:07:07,544 --> 00:07:09,504
to participate in
Wu Dang Martial Arts competition?

97
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,129
I am,

98
00:07:11,338 --> 00:07:12,961
from Pin Jin,
2 towns, 2 province

99
00:07:13,504 --> 00:07:14,796
and the most handsome fighter

100
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,880
You are beautiful

101
00:07:22,254 --> 00:07:24,379
What you are wearing is also beautiful.

102
00:07:25,587 --> 00:07:26,546
Do not disturb the lady!

103
00:07:30,046 --> 00:07:30,755
Don't be afraid

104
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,879
You are going to Hubei?

105
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:34,296
For what purpose?

106
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:36,963
To rob

107
00:07:39,464 --> 00:07:41,756
This lady is rather amusing!

108
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:44,215
What are you going to rob?

109
00:07:45,547 --> 00:07:47,256
To rob an invitation card

110
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,048
For example, like this one.

111
00:07:49,506 --> 00:07:51,214
You are going to rob me
of my invitation card?

112
00:07:51,713 --> 00:07:53,214
You are going to Wu Dang
for competition,

113
00:07:53,505 --> 00:07:54,421
then, where am I going?

114
00:07:54,588 --> 00:07:55,381
Go home,

115
00:07:56,131 --> 00:07:56,799
or else,

116
00:07:57,756 --> 00:07:58,798
to the hospital.

117
00:07:59,048 --> 00:08:01,340
How dare you play around with me!

118
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:47,301
Wudang - Invitation

119
00:10:43,223 --> 00:10:45,222
Pure Land Beyond the Clouds

120
00:10:46,222 --> 00:10:48,181
Purple Mist Hall

121
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:54,181
Great Wu Dang - Heaven & Earth's Code

122
00:10:57,598 --> 00:11:00,099
I wonder who are we going to send
for the martial art's competition?

123
00:11:00,724 --> 00:11:02,557
Have you decided yet?

124
00:11:04,724 --> 00:11:05,390
White Dragon

125
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:06,849
the Master is soundly asleep

126
00:11:06,974 --> 00:11:07,808
Let's not disturb him

127
00:11:08,683 --> 00:11:09,265
Let's go

128
00:11:15,349 --> 00:11:16,850
Haven't arrive yet?

129
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:20,558
Waiting for who?

130
00:11:54,144 --> 00:11:55,518
Ning, be careful!

131
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:00,685
Are you alright?

132
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,394
Go, go, go, go!

133
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,270
How can anyone be so careless?

134
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,352
Just sped out suddenly.

135
00:12:14,394 --> 00:12:15,017
How is it?

136
00:12:15,018 --> 00:12:16,768
The bike is broken.
We'll just have to walk up the moutain road.

137
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:17,936
Ok.

138
00:12:19,727 --> 00:12:22,269
Daddy, was that a taoist priest?

139
00:12:22,436 --> 00:12:23,270
I think he is.

140
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:25,811
I felt that he is very compassionate.

141
00:12:26,728 --> 00:12:28,062
Let's go.

142
00:12:37,437 --> 00:12:39,146
Sui He-Yi, you're late.

143
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,563
Brother,

144
00:12:40,854 --> 00:12:41,394
I...

145
00:12:44,228 --> 00:12:45,061
Why is the water so little?

146
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:46,396
Brother,

147
00:12:46,563 --> 00:12:47,688
half way on the road,

148
00:12:48,229 --> 00:12:50,438
I encountered a car,
and was nearly knock down by it

149
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:51,769
That is why the water ...

150
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,855
You don't have to lie to me.

151
00:12:53,188 --> 00:12:55,730
You know the rules laid down
by White Dragon priest is very strict

152
00:12:57,355 --> 00:12:59,105
Go over there and pluck out all the weeds

153
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,896
Yes, brother.

154
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,740
How are you...

155
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:12,063
We are here to participate in
the martial art's competition

156
00:13:15,355 --> 00:13:17,939
Taoist Xie is gone!
Taoist Xie is gone!

157
00:13:22,938 --> 00:13:24,063
Go, go, go. Quick!

158
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:27,481
What is it?

159
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:28,565
The head priest is gone.

160
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,690
Uncle, the head priest is gone.

161
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:37,982
Excuse me...

162
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,066
The head priest have no more pulse.

163
00:13:56,898 --> 00:13:58,233
The head priest have passed on.

164
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:01,232
We are all very sad.

165
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:04,067
Life is just but a glimpse.

166
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:06,401
I believe,

167
00:14:06,775 --> 00:14:10,150
he have attained nivarna and
have ascended

168
00:14:12,482 --> 00:14:13,150
Who is he?

169
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:15,233
He is the martial art
competition sponsor

170
00:14:15,483 --> 00:14:16,317
Mr. Tang Yun Long

171
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,358
Even though the head priest's vital
signs are gone

172
00:14:22,734 --> 00:14:24,360
But if I am not wrong,

173
00:14:25,526 --> 00:14:26,901
he is using Turtle Relaxation technique.

174
00:14:27,609 --> 00:14:29,735
According to western science

175
00:14:30,234 --> 00:14:31,152
Is temporary hibernation.

176
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,235
Hibernation?

177
00:14:32,818 --> 00:14:33,618
Yes.

178
00:14:33,735 --> 00:14:35,484
He's gone into a state of nothingness,

179
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,611
just like a deity.

180
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,359
The head priest's powers is
beyond prediction

181
00:14:40,401 --> 00:14:41,067
Taoist Xie

182
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:42,693
Taoist Xie

183
00:14:46,027 --> 00:14:47,068
Taoist Xie has awaken!

184
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:49,235
Head Priest, you have awakened.

185
00:14:50,735 --> 00:14:52,068
Thank God!

186
00:14:52,861 --> 00:14:53,694
OK! OK!

187
00:14:53,777 --> 00:14:55,902
You've arrived.
You've finally arrived.

188
00:14:57,111 --> 00:14:58,153
Everyone,

189
00:14:58,402 --> 00:15:01,403
Sui He-Yi is Wu Dang's representative.

190
00:15:02,237 --> 00:15:03,069
You're really great

191
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,195
The head priest came alive again.

192
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,279
You again!

193
00:15:05,945 --> 00:15:07,777
Sui He-Yi is only a lay disciple,

194
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,986
Even he know a bit of martial art

195
00:15:10,653 --> 00:15:11,902
but it is not sufficient

196
00:15:12,903 --> 00:15:14,737
Besides, there are others more senior

197
00:15:15,402 --> 00:15:16,736
It wouldn't be his turn to represent.

198
00:15:16,903 --> 00:15:17,737
Yes.

199
00:15:18,361 --> 00:15:19,360
Yes, he is right,
Head Priest Xie.

200
00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:21,571
My kung fu is inadequate,

201
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:22,905
and not up to par.

202
00:15:23,196 --> 00:15:24,821
My only desire is to take
of my mother

203
00:15:25,195 --> 00:15:27,238
and to cure her sickness

204
00:15:27,446 --> 00:15:28,738
Such a important task.
I won't be able to undertake it

205
00:15:29,613 --> 00:15:31,945
To be able to do and not doing,

206
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,905
To be able to walk and not walking.

207
00:15:35,362 --> 00:15:36,236
Head priest,

208
00:15:37,112 --> 00:15:38,446
If he were to represent,

209
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,738
we are bound to lose

210
00:15:40,738 --> 00:15:41,571
Besides,

211
00:15:41,696 --> 00:15:43,405
once, every 500 years competition

212
00:15:43,947 --> 00:15:47,697
Wu Dang cannot lose face

213
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,863
To lose is to win,

214
00:15:50,572 --> 00:15:52,322
To win is to lose.

215
00:15:53,322 --> 00:15:54,655
Make good the preparation

216
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:56,530
Fight!

217
00:15:57,113 --> 00:15:57,946
No way!

218
00:15:58,363 --> 00:15:59,615
I haven't ask my mother yet!

219
00:16:35,907 --> 00:16:37,740
What you're hold is the
treasure map, right?

220
00:16:40,824 --> 00:16:42,241
No, there isn't any treasure map?

221
00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:43,908
Unless,

222
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:45,533
you came here to rob treasures?

223
00:16:59,242 --> 00:17:00,576
I'm very sorry, priest

224
00:17:00,743 --> 00:17:01,657
I've lost my way

225
00:17:01,658 --> 00:17:03,658
May I ask, if this is Blissful Palace?

226
00:17:04,992 --> 00:17:06,034
I am not a priest.

227
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:09,366
My dear Auntie, the priest you are
looking for is over there

228
00:17:10,576 --> 00:17:11,992
Hello priest, how are you?

229
00:17:13,034 --> 00:17:13,992
It's like this

230
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,076
I am a representative of Pin Jin
of 2 town, 2 provinces

231
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,910
I am here for the competition.

232
00:17:22,744 --> 00:17:23,911
My junior is sick.

233
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,910
So, I took his place.

234
00:17:25,993 --> 00:17:27,077
My name is Tien Xin

235
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:29,202
and not auntie at all.

236
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:55,244
To commemorate the renovation of Wu Dang
500 years anniversary

237
00:17:55,495 --> 00:17:57,912
and the reconstruction
of the Five Dragon Place

238
00:17:58,704 --> 00:18:01,994
Today, a competition is held for
young martial artists

239
00:18:02,244 --> 00:18:04,578
Representatives from the whole of China

240
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,119
Oversea's Chinese
organisation's representatives

241
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:09,910
With the spirit to promote Taoism

242
00:18:09,911 --> 00:18:14,578
To encourage youth to learn
leadership, learning and dissemination,

243
00:18:14,787 --> 00:18:16,455
To attend this conference.

244
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:20,121
Representative from Sichuan,
Kong Tong sect - Wei Chuen Yang

245
00:18:20,913 --> 00:18:26,205
His opponent, from Bei Ping,
Tianjin, Dragon's Gate sect, Tien Xin

246
00:18:34,331 --> 00:18:35,455
I never fight with women

247
00:18:35,705 --> 00:18:36,705
Qucikly, go home.

248
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,247
The biggest mistake in your life,

249
00:18:45,414 --> 00:18:47,789
is to despised women.

250
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,581
This is called Cannon Hammer.

251
00:19:08,872 --> 00:19:10,121
If you got struck by that blow,

252
00:19:10,122 --> 00:19:11,082
that will be disastrous.

253
00:19:11,248 --> 00:19:12,915
If you meet an opponent like this,

254
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,041
Don't fight and just admit defeat.

255
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,583
You think that this sister
will lose for sure?

256
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,165
Good! Good! Good!

257
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:46,375
Good! Fantatic! Good!

258
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,416
What sister is using,
is it Southern Tai Chi?

259
00:19:58,833 --> 00:19:59,750
What technique is this?

260
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:13,752
Could it be...

261
00:20:14,336 --> 00:20:18,294
the rumored secret technique from
Master Zhang San Feng - Silkworm Form?

262
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,503
The form is but the essence isn't.

263
00:20:22,878 --> 00:20:24,877
Silkworm Form?

264
00:20:28,085 --> 00:20:30,043
Good! Great! Good!

265
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,836
Tien Xin won.

266
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,878
Good! Good! Good!

267
00:21:01,586 --> 00:21:02,420
Second match

268
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:05,379
From America's National Taoist
Association, Tang Ning

269
00:21:05,836 --> 00:21:09,254
Daughter, Dad brought you here is just
to broaden your view

270
00:21:09,255 --> 00:21:10,088
Don't be too serious.

271
00:21:10,255 --> 00:21:11,421
If you can't win, just admit defeat.

272
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:15,089
Daddy, my ears are numb.

273
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,713
Then don't use your ears

274
00:21:17,713 --> 00:21:18,546
Just watch my hands.

275
00:22:44,883 --> 00:22:46,927
Good! Good! Good!

276
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,135
Tang Ning won

277
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:55,260
Pain?

278
00:22:57,592 --> 00:22:59,593
Bear it for a while.
Daddy will be more gentle

279
00:23:00,135 --> 00:23:01,884
Just bear it for a while.

280
00:23:02,676 --> 00:23:04,677
Daddy, did I win beautifully?

281
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:07,010
You still dare to say

282
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,511
You promised me just to play a while,

283
00:23:09,885 --> 00:23:10,094
then admit defeat

284
00:23:10,594 --> 00:23:11,761
You fought too seriously.

285
00:23:12,261 --> 00:23:13,553
My heart keeps pounding while watching.

286
00:23:14,511 --> 00:23:15,261
But

287
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,262
Dad, whatever you do,
you are very serious

288
00:23:17,803 --> 00:23:19,094
Why did you tell me not
to be serious?

289
00:23:25,845 --> 00:23:26,387
It's okay now.

290
00:23:28,345 --> 00:23:29,387
It's getting late.

291
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:32,053
It's time for Daddy to go to the
male dormitory to rest

292
00:23:32,636 --> 00:23:33,512
Have an early night.

293
00:23:35,011 --> 00:23:36,512
Daddy?

294
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:40,512
What kind of sickness did Mummy
contracted and left us?

295
00:23:44,596 --> 00:23:45,596
Actually,

296
00:23:46,555 --> 00:23:48,720
I like to know how you and mummy
know each other

297
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,720
Didn't I told you before.

298
00:23:52,178 --> 00:23:54,679
I used to have a pigtail
during the Ching Dynasty

299
00:23:55,471 --> 00:23:56,387
After that,

300
00:23:56,846 --> 00:23:58,430
I crossed the sea to America,

301
00:23:59,012 --> 00:24:01,595
met your mother in a Chinese restaurant

302
00:24:06,972 --> 00:24:07,806
It's enough

303
00:24:08,264 --> 00:24:09,472
It's late.

304
00:24:10,055 --> 00:24:11,180
Rest early.

305
00:24:13,097 --> 00:24:17,180
Daddy, when you came to Wu Dang
with the treasure map

306
00:24:17,347 --> 00:24:18,722
I felt that you are troubled

307
00:24:19,013 --> 00:24:21,763
Did you really brought me here just
to appraise martial arts?

308
00:24:23,348 --> 00:24:23,973
I...

309
00:24:24,473 --> 00:24:25,681
brought you here for match-making.

310
00:24:26,806 --> 00:24:27,681
Daddy, you're disgusting.

311
00:24:29,556 --> 00:24:33,848
Daughter, don't be angry.

312
00:24:46,931 --> 00:24:48,265
Golden Hall

313
00:24:49,931 --> 00:24:51,306
Southern Rocks

314
00:24:57,349 --> 00:25:00,474
Dragon Sword with Seven Powers
like a treasure mountain

315
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:04,850
Five Dragon Palace?

316
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:23,100
Dad.

317
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,684
Your daddy died young

318
00:25:49,226 --> 00:25:52,767
If not, you would be married with kids

319
00:25:53,601 --> 00:25:55,935
My health is also not good.

320
00:25:59,478 --> 00:26:01,436
Mum, don't forget

321
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:03,228
We are at Wudang Mountain,

322
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,769
This is a magical mountain.
With healing powers

323
00:26:06,145 --> 00:26:08,020
Your sickness can certainly be cured.

324
00:26:08,687 --> 00:26:10,728
Now, my only wish is

325
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,436
to find you a wife.

326
00:26:16,436 --> 00:26:18,269
Daddy, you promised me

327
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:21,395
that we will be partners once
we are in Wudang mountain

328
00:26:21,644 --> 00:26:22,520
right?

329
00:26:26,812 --> 00:26:28,146
I am not your Dad.

330
00:26:38,146 --> 00:26:38,938
- What is it?
- Nothing, mum!

331
00:26:39,063 --> 00:26:39,896
Do not be afraid.
Mum, don't be afraid

332
00:26:39,897 --> 00:26:41,105
Who are you?

333
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:44,396
You again

334
00:26:46,895 --> 00:26:48,771
What! You know her?

335
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,605
She is a guest of Taoist priest Xie.

336
00:26:52,896 --> 00:26:54,188
It's a young woman

337
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,438
Son, you don't have to get ordained.

338
00:26:57,273 --> 00:26:58,023
Lady,

339
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,439
are you alright?

340
00:27:04,106 --> 00:27:04,856
Young lady!

341
00:27:48,108 --> 00:27:49,107
Tien Xin,

342
00:27:49,607 --> 00:27:53,566
Tsuen Tien sword is our tribe's
sacred relic

343
00:27:54,024 --> 00:27:56,650
It was forged from asteroid rocks

344
00:27:57,026 --> 00:27:58,817
It has very strong powers.

345
00:27:59,775 --> 00:28:02,483
Your father went to China
to search for the sword

346
00:28:03,276 --> 00:28:05,234
but after many years,
there is no news of him

347
00:28:06,026 --> 00:28:08,651
When we found his body in the desert

348
00:28:08,942 --> 00:28:11,233
his hand is still holding this pearl

349
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:15,817
It must be connected to the
where abouts of the sacred sword

350
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:20,985
When you grow up,

351
00:28:21,401 --> 00:28:24,276
you must complete your Dad's duty

352
00:28:32,027 --> 00:28:32,827
Thief!

353
00:28:50,027 --> 00:28:52,110
There is an accomplice.

354
00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:31,197
Go quickly.

355
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,238
Young lady, you've awakened.

356
00:29:45,821 --> 00:29:46,988
I am very worried

357
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,113
You fell from the roof.

358
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,823
I was afraid that you might be
paralyzed like me

359
00:29:52,281 --> 00:29:53,406
I'm so sorry

360
00:29:53,573 --> 00:29:54,822
that I damaged your roof.

361
00:29:54,947 --> 00:29:56,114
My dad will pay you

362
00:29:56,281 --> 00:29:56,948
No need to pay.

363
00:29:57,406 --> 00:29:58,239
I've repaired it.

364
00:30:00,615 --> 00:30:02,740
Aren't you the Wudang representative?

365
00:30:03,573 --> 00:30:04,448
I am also a representative

366
00:30:05,074 --> 00:30:06,114
I won today.

367
00:30:06,946 --> 00:30:08,530
We might be competiting against
each other.

368
00:30:09,615 --> 00:30:10,531
I won't go and compete.

369
00:30:12,324 --> 00:30:12,948
Why?

370
00:30:13,865 --> 00:30:14,823
I have to take care of my mother.

371
00:30:15,615 --> 00:30:16,573
Aiya,

372
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:18,574
hurry up and get married

373
00:30:18,741 --> 00:30:20,574
then you won't have to take care of me.

374
00:30:21,657 --> 00:30:22,449
Young lady

375
00:30:23,157 --> 00:30:24,657
What is your name?

376
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:25,741
Tang Ning.

377
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:26,991
Ning Er,

378
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:29,324
this is my son.

379
00:30:29,616 --> 00:30:31,076
He's called Sui He-Yi,

380
00:30:31,533 --> 00:30:32,950
and still not married.

381
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:34,949
How about you?

382
00:30:35,823 --> 00:30:38,741
Mum, the lady is still young.
Don't scare her.

383
00:30:40,282 --> 00:30:41,699
Not that young..

384
00:30:45,491 --> 00:30:46,533
Mum, have an early night.

385
00:30:46,866 --> 00:30:47,658
Son,

386
00:30:48,282 --> 00:30:50,159
both of you are very compatible.

387
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:54,076
I'm sleeping immediately.

388
00:30:54,284 --> 00:30:55,784
Have a nice chat

389
00:30:55,785 --> 00:30:57,450
I won't hear a thing.

390
00:30:57,451 --> 00:30:59,284
Ok, ok, sleep tight.

391
00:31:03,284 --> 00:31:03,909
Lady,

392
00:31:04,534 --> 00:31:05,698
I think you've lost your way

393
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:06,825
Don't always call me lady

394
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,117
My name is Tang Ning.

395
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:27,744
Mosquitoes are pests.

396
00:31:28,244 --> 00:31:31,203
Pest also have a life.
Besides, I've made a wish

397
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,286
that if my mum's illness is cured

398
00:31:33,619 --> 00:31:34,744
I won't kill any living thing.

399
00:31:37,203 --> 00:31:38,619
When the night comes,
and the weather is cool

400
00:31:39,035 --> 00:31:39,911
there won't be any mosquitoes

401
00:31:43,285 --> 00:31:44,286
Actually, humans

402
00:31:44,786 --> 00:31:46,119
is part of the universe.

403
00:31:46,953 --> 00:31:47,787
Mosquitoes too

404
00:31:48,329 --> 00:31:49,996
All things in the world too.

405
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:53,120
Lay disciple needs to learn the "way"?

406
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,329
In fact, I'm very stupid.

407
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:56,788
Taoist priest Xie,

408
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,828
taught me the "Way",
and that all things are one

409
00:32:00,287 --> 00:32:01,496
He taught me meditation

410
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,744
and said we can feel "life"

411
00:32:05,453 --> 00:32:06,454
I am really no good at it.

412
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:09,996
Can you feel it?

413
00:32:14,455 --> 00:32:15,621
I just felt that,

414
00:32:20,496 --> 00:32:21,788
I've got no life now.

415
00:32:33,497 --> 00:32:34,705
It's you

416
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:36,955
Aren't you the sponsor?

417
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,456
And I have to rescue you

418
00:32:39,789 --> 00:32:41,830
If not for me,
you will surely be caught.

419
00:32:42,288 --> 00:32:42,789
Stop boasting

420
00:32:43,081 --> 00:32:44,162
I am the one who saved you.

421
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:46,123
If not for my last attack,
can you escape?

422
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:47,748
You came here to steal?

423
00:32:48,123 --> 00:32:50,123
The sacred sword belongs to our tribe

424
00:32:50,456 --> 00:32:51,831
I've been searching for it for years.

425
00:32:52,123 --> 00:32:53,123
Then things is easier.

426
00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:54,872
In total, Wudang have 7 treasures

427
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:56,791
I have a suggestion.
Let's co-operate.

428
00:32:56,916 --> 00:32:59,457
Once the job is done. The sword belongs to you.
All the rest will belong to me

429
00:33:00,122 --> 00:33:02,665
You have tested White Dragon's
prowess earlier on.

430
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:05,289
With your strenght alone,
you won't be able to succeed

431
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,290
Let's do it together.
Do you dare?

432
00:33:06,624 --> 00:33:07,582
Why not?

433
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,583
But our personality is different.

434
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:11,956
I came here to get back what
belongs to me.

435
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:12,958
You are here to steal.

436
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,249
But when you steal,

437
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:16,624
why did you bring your daughter here?

438
00:33:16,874 --> 00:33:17,998
What you are doing might cause harm to her.

439
00:33:18,165 --> 00:33:18,999
What did you say?

440
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:20,333
Killed my daughter?

441
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:23,582
When I just came out,

442
00:33:24,334 --> 00:33:25,459
She thought I was you,

443
00:33:26,043 --> 00:33:27,251
chasing behind me.

444
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:29,917
Finally, fell off the cliff.

445
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:32,500
But don't worry,

446
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,792
I think she is now ...

447
00:33:38,999 --> 00:33:40,208
This is Wudang Mountain,

448
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:41,542
it has healing energy.

449
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:42,958
It can cure any disease.

450
00:33:43,124 --> 00:33:43,960
Ning Er!

451
00:33:44,084 --> 00:33:45,960
Ning Er! Ning Er!

452
00:33:46,126 --> 00:33:48,876
Daddy, what happen to you?

453
00:33:49,668 --> 00:33:50,418
Are you alright?

454
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,709
Didn't you fell from the cliff?

455
00:33:54,085 --> 00:33:55,210
Yes I did.

456
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:56,876
Fortunately,

457
00:33:57,043 --> 00:33:58,084
I used my internal energy to protect me

458
00:33:58,209 --> 00:33:59,209
Look at me, I'm alright.

459
00:34:01,376 --> 00:34:02,459
You frightened me to death.

460
00:34:13,293 --> 00:34:15,336
Yunnan, Da Mao sect - Liu Kun won.

461
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:16,710
The next match,

462
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:19,586
Seoul, Chuen Zhen's representative
- Li Tsuen De.

463
00:34:19,961 --> 00:34:23,337
His opponent from Shangdong,
Peng Lai sect - Zhang Yang

464
00:34:36,962 --> 00:34:38,002
Li Tsuen De won.

465
00:34:38,503 --> 00:34:39,795
The last match for today,

466
00:34:40,461 --> 00:34:42,045
America's Taoist Association's
representative - Tang Ning

467
00:34:42,671 --> 00:34:44,463
Ning Er, remember what I said.

468
00:34:44,671 --> 00:34:45,754
If you can't win, just admit defeat.

469
00:34:46,129 --> 00:34:47,004
Okay, okay.

470
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:06,131
I won't give way.

471
00:35:06,629 --> 00:35:07,630
You also do your best.

472
00:35:08,046 --> 00:35:10,297
Don't let your father down.

473
00:35:25,464 --> 00:35:26,005
Come on!

474
00:35:41,966 --> 00:35:43,798
I've lost

475
00:35:46,091 --> 00:35:48,841
Thanks for giving way

476
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,216
Tang Ning won

477
00:35:56,132 --> 00:35:57,132
You are lucky you didn't lose,

478
00:35:57,631 --> 00:35:58,173
Where are you going?

479
00:35:58,465 --> 00:35:59,258
It's a secret.

480
00:35:59,383 --> 00:36:00,216
Professor Tang

481
00:36:00,757 --> 00:36:02,049
Last night, why did you go up the mountain?

482
00:36:02,425 --> 00:36:04,050
I've got no face to back to
Chiang Dong to see the elders

483
00:36:04,134 --> 00:36:05,464
I'm sorry.
Did I hit you?

484
00:36:05,465 --> 00:36:06,299
Miss Tien Xin

485
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,175
Did you have a good sleep last night?

486
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,925
No good.
I had a nightmare.

487
00:36:14,425 --> 00:36:16,717
Mum, bear with it.

488
00:36:21,135 --> 00:36:22,051
Sui He-Yi!

489
00:36:30,092 --> 00:36:31,300
Mum, we're reaching.

490
00:36:31,675 --> 00:36:32,509
Bear with it.

491
00:36:36,551 --> 00:36:38,135
If I guess correctly,

492
00:36:38,218 --> 00:36:40,260
the two of us are under
White Dragon's suspicion

493
00:36:40,468 --> 00:36:42,968
That is why in the competition
you deliberately lost the match.

494
00:36:43,135 --> 00:36:44,552
By using daylight for our operation

495
00:36:45,052 --> 00:36:46,635
White Dragon is unable to leave now

496
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:47,969
No time to keep vigil on the sword

497
00:36:48,136 --> 00:36:49,927
We have bigger plans.

498
00:36:50,136 --> 00:36:51,968
We will have to follow the next verse
to get to our next target

499
00:36:52,551 --> 00:36:53,801
Truth Sutra and Heavenly Pill

500
00:36:53,926 --> 00:36:54,726
Hey,

501
00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:56,051
Why don't you continue to
get the sacred sword?

502
00:36:56,467 --> 00:36:57,511
I'm not that stupid

503
00:36:57,636 --> 00:36:59,011
Once you've got the sword,
you would leave.

504
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:01,594
Truth Sutra,

505
00:37:02,594 --> 00:37:05,261
should be the 5,000 verse of the
Dao De Sutra by Lao Tzu

506
00:37:05,428 --> 00:37:06,553
Hidden in Blissful Palace.

507
00:37:06,845 --> 00:37:09,052
Another treasure is the Heavenly Pill.

508
00:37:09,845 --> 00:37:12,302
Made by Taoist Zhang

509
00:37:12,344 --> 00:37:13,553
said to cure all illness.

510
00:37:16,554 --> 00:37:17,512
Hidden in ...

511
00:37:18,595 --> 00:37:19,803
Prince hides in the dragon bed

512
00:37:21,219 --> 00:37:22,761
What's so great about it?

513
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,511
Hide the heavenly pill.

514
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,512
Poetry is actually so simple.

515
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,428
Why don't we split up.

516
00:37:29,386 --> 00:37:29,928
OK.

517
00:37:31,178 --> 00:37:32,845
If you think you can act alone...

518
00:37:33,304 --> 00:37:34,970
I have no objection.

519
00:37:35,304 --> 00:37:36,803
You go get the Sutra,

520
00:37:36,804 --> 00:37:37,887
I will go and get the Heavenly Pill.

521
00:37:38,513 --> 00:37:39,888
Why do I have to get the Sutra?

522
00:37:40,222 --> 00:37:41,179
Because I've checked

523
00:37:41,346 --> 00:37:43,388
There are only 2 priest guarding
the Blissful Palace

524
00:37:44,055 --> 00:37:45,054
It's relatively easier to operate.

525
00:37:46,513 --> 00:37:49,305
The biggest mistake of your life
is to despise...

526
00:37:49,929 --> 00:37:50,929
I'm just joking with you.

527
00:37:51,595 --> 00:37:52,471
Wu Dang is full of skilled pugilist

528
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:54,345
You've better be careful.

529
00:38:03,222 --> 00:38:04,347
Before the sun sets,

530
00:38:04,472 --> 00:38:05,805
we'll see who complete first.

531
00:38:20,973 --> 00:38:21,889
Mum, you're awake.

532
00:38:22,389 --> 00:38:23,389
Mum has woken.

533
00:38:26,222 --> 00:38:30,222
Miss Tang Ning. Miss Tang Ning

534
00:38:30,223 --> 00:38:31,056
Auntie.

535
00:38:34,224 --> 00:38:36,224
All the meridians and channels
in her body are cleared

536
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:39,682
Only the heart is not cleared

537
00:38:42,308 --> 00:38:45,932
Good, you are cured

538
00:38:45,933 --> 00:38:47,600
You can get out of bed
and walk around.

539
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,972
I can get out of bed and walk?

540
00:38:50,973 --> 00:38:51,724
Try it.

541
00:38:51,973 --> 00:38:52,599
Mum,

542
00:38:52,933 --> 00:38:53,975
Try it, give it a go.

543
00:38:56,349 --> 00:38:58,309
One, two, three.

544
00:39:00,725 --> 00:39:01,434
Very good.

545
00:39:01,808 --> 00:39:03,642
Mum, you really can walk again.

546
00:39:04,058 --> 00:39:05,516
Aiya, I can move.

547
00:39:05,517 --> 00:39:06,767
Sit down first.
Sit down first.

548
00:39:08,308 --> 00:39:09,309
I can really walk.

549
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:12,226
Thank heaven. When the bad is gone,
fortune will come.

550
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,102
Your mother's illness is alright now.

551
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,142
Thank you, head priest.

552
00:39:16,143 --> 00:39:16,809
Thank you.

553
00:39:17,058 --> 00:39:19,976
Now you can compete for Wudang
without worries

554
00:39:20,143 --> 00:39:20,943
I ...

555
00:39:21,434 --> 00:39:24,684
You don't have to be ordained.
Go and compete without worries.

556
00:39:25,017 --> 00:39:27,435
Go and thank the head priest
and show your gratitude

557
00:39:28,143 --> 00:39:28,933
I know.

558
00:41:02,481 --> 00:41:03,565
Who is it?

559
00:41:04,647 --> 00:41:06,064
Pursue him.

560
00:41:10,648 --> 00:41:12,981
Stand still

561
00:42:19,817 --> 00:42:20,692
Please forgive me

562
00:42:21,276 --> 00:42:22,576
Thank you very much.

563
00:42:34,903 --> 00:42:35,819
How are you, head priest.

564
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:38,652
I am a disciple of Si-Yue, Hua Mountain,
Ninth Heavenly Palace.

565
00:42:39,653 --> 00:42:41,360
Is it convenient for us to talk?

566
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,319
Is it convenient for us to talk?

567
00:42:45,278 --> 00:42:47,445
Head priest, to tell the truth

568
00:42:47,737 --> 00:42:48,736
The nunnery...

569
00:42:52,986 --> 00:42:55,654
I think the one we had was Ying Sutra
and yours is the Yang Sutra.

570
00:42:57,195 --> 00:42:59,029
I thought since the
Ying Sutra was stolen...

571
00:42:59,236 --> 00:43:02,654
your Yang Sutra might be stolen too...

572
00:43:02,945 --> 00:43:04,863
Haha, you've been fooled.

573
00:43:05,488 --> 00:43:06,404
You've been fooled.

574
00:43:09,528 --> 00:43:11,570
That's it!

575
00:43:20,821 --> 00:43:23,614
Strange.
Not even one taoist priest

576
00:43:24,155 --> 00:43:28,072
Remember, the preparations for my
my plan will not be in vain

577
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:41,072
The sutra is really hidden here?

578
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,155
I hope it's not a trap

579
00:44:17,282 --> 00:44:18,824
"Dao De Sutra"

580
00:44:25,325 --> 00:44:28,159
What kind of treasure is this?
So easy to get hold of.

581
00:44:28,783 --> 00:44:31,159
My acting and my kung fu
have no usage at all.

582
00:44:31,909 --> 00:44:33,617
Wasted my time practicing

583
00:44:49,076 --> 00:44:50,117
Great bandit, Tang Yun Long

584
00:44:50,326 --> 00:44:50,867
You're late.

585
00:44:51,326 --> 00:44:52,243
You've lost.

586
00:44:52,826 --> 00:44:55,326
Nun Tien Xin, you've won.

587
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:56,576
You are injured.

588
00:44:58,076 --> 00:44:59,326
You are also injured.

589
00:45:00,494 --> 00:45:02,494
The priest you talk about
is really skillful

590
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,285
I nearly can't escape.

591
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:05,660
Here!

592
00:45:06,992 --> 00:45:07,866
It's already rusty.

593
00:45:07,867 --> 00:45:09,202
Don't know why it's called a treasure.

594
00:45:12,369 --> 00:45:13,035
Eh, look here.

595
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,993
Let's proceed to our next target.

596
00:45:16,826 --> 00:45:19,577
Outside the cave of the Eight
Meridian hides the black leader.

597
00:45:21,703 --> 00:45:23,119
Didn't you say that poetry is simple?

598
00:45:23,286 --> 00:45:24,161
Explain.

599
00:45:25,995 --> 00:45:26,994
It is that simple.

600
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:27,702
Yes...

601
00:45:28,495 --> 00:45:30,870
The eight pulse...

602
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:33,161
I think that there are 2 treasures.

603
00:45:33,203 --> 00:45:34,994
You see, the Eight Meridian,

604
00:45:35,078 --> 00:45:36,786
Perhaps it's the Eight Meridian in a cave

605
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:37,911
Black leader...

606
00:45:38,203 --> 00:45:39,285
Maybe the head is pitch black...

607
00:45:39,286 --> 00:45:40,912
Black Leader...
Shou Wu [Polygonim multiflorum]

608
00:45:42,621 --> 00:45:44,328
Wu Dang Mountain is known for it
fertile land and healing energy

609
00:45:44,787 --> 00:45:47,621
A pair of thousand year old Ho Shou Wu
is growing here

610
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,120
Just a pair?

611
00:45:50,538 --> 00:45:52,204
There are many thousand
year old Ho Shou Wu.

612
00:45:52,829 --> 00:45:54,162
And they are husband and wife,

613
00:45:54,538 --> 00:45:55,579
quarreled frequently.

614
00:45:56,287 --> 00:45:57,412
That's why I dislike men,

615
00:45:57,496 --> 00:45:58,747
I still like to be alone.

616
00:45:59,288 --> 00:46:00,330
Women are more troublesome.

617
00:46:00,497 --> 00:46:01,664
I like to be independent.

618
00:46:02,038 --> 00:46:04,163
Right. We will always
be on different paths.

619
00:46:04,538 --> 00:46:06,120
After we've stolen the treasures

620
00:46:06,246 --> 00:46:07,746
You can sell them and make money

621
00:46:07,913 --> 00:46:08,829
and I can go home.

622
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:10,703
I am not the greedy

623
00:46:10,704 --> 00:46:12,703
selfish type, who would die for money

624
00:46:12,704 --> 00:46:14,704
Okay, don't waste my time.

625
00:46:16,122 --> 00:46:17,997
Don't think that you are so self righteous

626
00:46:18,081 --> 00:46:20,412
If you think that the sacred sword
belongs to your tribe,

627
00:46:20,413 --> 00:46:21,372
bring out some proof.

628
00:46:22,956 --> 00:46:24,498
The sacred was originally from our tribe.

629
00:46:25,165 --> 00:46:25,965
Proof?

630
00:46:26,289 --> 00:46:28,289
Even if there is no proof.
The sword still belongs to our tribe.

631
00:46:29,997 --> 00:46:30,706
Okay.

632
00:46:31,081 --> 00:46:33,414
Without you, I can still find
the sacred sword.

633
00:46:34,831 --> 00:46:35,413
I can!

634
00:46:44,332 --> 00:46:48,957
Sleeping Kung Fu, is the higher skill for
internal sect of martial arts.

635
00:46:50,456 --> 00:46:52,249
Zhuang Tzu dreamt and became a butterfly

636
00:46:52,873 --> 00:46:55,998
The butterfly dreamt and became Zhuang Tzu.

637
00:46:56,417 --> 00:46:59,250
Grandmaster Chen Chuan slept for 800 years

638
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:01,999
for the youth of Sung Dynasty

639
00:47:02,166 --> 00:47:03,707
Beggar Su Qi Er slept,

640
00:47:03,998 --> 00:47:08,582
and learned Drunken LuoHan Fist.

641
00:47:10,542 --> 00:47:12,416
Close your eyes,

642
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:15,582
Open your eyes,

643
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:19,667
A day will pass.

644
00:47:22,334 --> 00:47:26,376
Sleep deity. Sleep deity.

645
00:47:26,835 --> 00:47:30,667
When the rock takes hold,
all the years will be forgotten.

646
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,875
The 3 Rays goes deeper,
your nature will be pure.

647
00:47:35,584 --> 00:47:42,085
Breathing and relaxation becomes natural

648
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,210
This is Grandmaster Zhang San Feng's
Sleeping Kung Fu's technique

649
00:47:48,043 --> 00:47:50,293
You must always remember it.

650
00:48:11,794 --> 00:48:13,002
Something happened in
Crouching Dragon's hall

651
00:48:13,378 --> 00:48:15,170
Head priest have not waken
from his practice

652
00:48:15,628 --> 00:48:16,462
What is it?

653
00:48:16,463 --> 00:48:18,003
The 7 of us pursued him

654
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:19,212
but he escaped.

655
00:48:20,504 --> 00:48:21,796
Any urgent things that you are seeing
the head priest?

656
00:48:21,962 --> 00:48:23,379
A robber appeared in
Crouching Dragon's hall.

657
00:48:23,753 --> 00:48:24,671
What have been stolen?

658
00:48:24,672 --> 00:48:26,378
Nothing is stolen.

659
00:48:27,129 --> 00:48:29,503
The thief is using an incense bag,

660
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:31,169
Took away a ball like object.

661
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:34,503
Auntie,

662
00:48:35,004 --> 00:48:37,005
Why did you suddently
let Sui He-Yi compete?

663
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:41,337
We are indebted to Head Priest Xie,

664
00:48:41,671 --> 00:48:43,295
Of course we have to return the favor.

665
00:48:46,463 --> 00:48:50,463
Last night, I dreamt that I and
Sui He-Yi was on a Baqua stage,

666
00:48:51,504 --> 00:48:52,463
just like a marriage ceremony.

667
00:48:52,839 --> 00:48:53,672
Bowing?

668
00:48:54,881 --> 00:48:56,588
No, no, nothing at all.

669
00:48:57,963 --> 00:48:58,588
Ning Er,

670
00:48:59,297 --> 00:49:01,714
open the box near my bed and have a look.

671
00:49:14,715 --> 00:49:15,715
It's beautiful.

672
00:49:16,381 --> 00:49:18,840
I've never worn such
Chinese clothes before.

673
00:49:19,465 --> 00:49:20,798
Quick wear it and have a look.

674
00:49:25,298 --> 00:49:26,922
How is it?

675
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:30,131
You've made the right choice.

676
00:49:30,506 --> 00:49:32,340
It is fated.

677
00:49:34,549 --> 00:49:37,340
This is what my mother
made for my marriage.

678
00:49:38,632 --> 00:49:40,507
Beautiful. Aiyaa, beautiful.

679
00:50:00,633 --> 00:50:02,591
It seems that I am disturbing your sleep.

680
00:50:03,049 --> 00:50:04,383
Why are you wearing my mother's clothes?

681
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:06,174
She gave it to me.

682
00:50:06,591 --> 00:50:07,174
Beautiful?

683
00:50:07,341 --> 00:50:08,341
It's beautiful.

684
00:50:08,842 --> 00:50:09,592
Where's my mother?

685
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:10,800
She is asleep.

686
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:11,843
I came here to find you.

687
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,051
I am practicing kung fu here.

688
00:50:13,551 --> 00:50:15,217
Thank you for taking care of my mother.

689
00:50:16,051 --> 00:50:17,176
I'm happy to do it.

690
00:50:17,843 --> 00:50:20,426
Actually, old folks are like children

691
00:50:20,676 --> 00:50:22,218
She listens to my stories.

692
00:50:22,427 --> 00:50:24,010
After a while she fell asleep.

693
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:25,967
You and your mother depended on each other

694
00:50:26,134 --> 00:50:27,383
Me and my father too.

695
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:30,342
These few years, only he
taught me martial arts

696
00:50:30,343 --> 00:50:31,342
and how to take care of my body

697
00:50:31,926 --> 00:50:33,510
He've done some research,

698
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:36,843
the most scientific way to take care of
the body is the Taoist way

699
00:50:38,594 --> 00:50:39,885
I talk too much.

700
00:50:41,343 --> 00:50:42,592
Don't worry about your mother

701
00:50:42,593 --> 00:50:44,010
I will visit her when I am free.

702
00:50:45,176 --> 00:50:46,094
Stretch out your hand.

703
00:50:47,759 --> 00:50:48,469
Close your eyes.

704
00:50:50,345 --> 00:50:51,095
This treasure of mine,

705
00:50:51,927 --> 00:50:53,343
have helped Head Priest Xie.

706
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,719
Give to you.

707
00:51:01,011 --> 00:51:01,886
What is it?

708
00:51:02,303 --> 00:51:03,720
Just a little worm.

709
00:51:04,385 --> 00:51:05,719
What's the big deal?

710
00:51:05,969 --> 00:51:07,386
Yunnan, Da Mou sect - Liu Kun,

711
00:51:07,469 --> 00:51:08,054
against,

712
00:51:09,137 --> 00:51:11,512
America's Chinese Taoist Association's
Tang Ning.

713
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:13,928
Daughter...

714
00:51:14,387 --> 00:51:17,179
Daddy, with you around,
I am confident.

715
00:51:17,846 --> 00:51:19,345
Tang Yun Long, come with me.

716
00:51:20,013 --> 00:51:21,345
Why? I can't go.

717
00:51:22,053 --> 00:51:22,928
Look over there.

718
00:51:24,679 --> 00:51:25,595
They're looking for you.

719
00:51:29,637 --> 00:51:31,846
Don't worry. If I can't win,
I'll just admit defeat

720
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:33,346
You guys go.

721
00:51:35,804 --> 00:51:36,346
Hurry up.

722
00:52:02,139 --> 00:52:03,597
Boss, Tang Yun Long is over there.

723
00:52:04,431 --> 00:52:05,181
Follow him.

724
00:52:05,431 --> 00:52:07,055
If necessary, kill him.

725
00:52:07,056 --> 00:52:07,856
Yes.

726
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:25,265
I am fine, don't worry.

727
00:52:33,849 --> 00:52:35,850
Most responsible father, wake up!

728
00:52:36,016 --> 00:52:37,016
We've been followed.

729
00:52:44,017 --> 00:52:45,392
They are not from Wudang.

730
00:52:46,017 --> 00:52:46,517
Their shoes are not the same

731
00:52:46,851 --> 00:52:48,018
Don't care about them.
Let's go quickly!

732
00:53:02,017 --> 00:53:03,100
Tang Ning won.

733
00:53:10,226 --> 00:53:11,852
I think this is Eight Meridian cave.

734
00:53:12,602 --> 00:53:13,682
There's a lot of people welcoming us.

735
00:53:13,683 --> 00:53:15,101
You sneak in from the Dragon's Head.

736
00:53:15,185 --> 00:53:17,601
We will lure the two groups of people
to the forest on the left.

737
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:54,770
Stand still! Stand still!

738
00:53:59,728 --> 00:54:01,478
Don't run! Stand still!

739
00:54:20,811 --> 00:54:21,811
Let's go!

740
00:54:28,189 --> 00:54:29,355
It's clearly stated that it's
Eight Meridian Palace.

741
00:54:29,438 --> 00:54:30,521
Why did it says Eight Meridian Cave?

742
00:54:30,647 --> 00:54:31,397
Don't think we are wrong.

743
00:54:37,938 --> 00:54:39,814
This treasure is connected to
the eight meridian

744
00:54:40,147 --> 00:54:42,231
It's only broken idols.
Which is the treasure?

745
00:54:42,315 --> 00:54:44,565
It must be here.
Let's search quickly.

746
00:54:51,689 --> 00:54:53,522
You think you can distract them
and lure them away?

747
00:54:54,397 --> 00:54:55,814
I've waited for you for a long time.

748
00:54:56,564 --> 00:54:58,648
Professor Tang.

749
00:55:01,232 --> 00:55:02,439
All yours.

750
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,107
Me?

751
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,358
If I fight with women,

752
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:05,816
I will definitely be at a disadvantage.

753
00:55:05,858 --> 00:55:07,024
I ... I ...

754
00:55:07,398 --> 00:55:10,857
I will not tear my own clothes
and pretend that I'm injured.

755
00:55:14,232 --> 00:55:15,981
Go find your treasure in your rubbish.

756
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:39,859
Please hurry up, for goodness sake!

757
00:55:40,525 --> 00:55:42,526
Eight Meridian...
is it 8 strings of golden wheat?

758
00:55:42,693 --> 00:55:44,233
Or is it 20% discount?

759
00:56:25,735 --> 00:56:26,569
Eight Meridian

760
00:56:27,611 --> 00:56:28,694
It's 7 Channel & 8 Meridian.

761
00:56:29,569 --> 00:56:30,319
Have you found it yet?

762
00:56:30,361 --> 00:56:31,028
Look at my strike.

763
00:56:33,028 --> 00:56:34,694
I've found it.

764
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:41,029
Tien Xin

765
00:56:41,736 --> 00:56:42,402
Tien Xin

766
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:45,111
I found the golden man.

767
00:56:55,696 --> 00:56:58,655
Tang Yun Long
You didn't expect that I didn't die

768
00:56:58,862 --> 00:56:59,655
I am very sorry

769
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:02,197
that I messed up your leg.

770
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:04,072
Know that you owe me a lot.

771
00:57:04,696 --> 00:57:05,696
Hand over the golden man

772
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:08,612
and your backpack.

773
00:57:19,947 --> 00:57:21,738
Attack!

774
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,154
Take the golden man and go

775
00:57:49,155 --> 00:57:50,073
I will take care of them

776
00:57:50,532 --> 00:57:51,448
If we go, we'll go together.

777
00:57:51,949 --> 00:57:53,449
If we fight, we fight together.

778
01:01:18,542 --> 01:01:20,208
Be careful.

779
01:01:44,168 --> 01:01:45,166
Your sleep kung fu is so lousy?

780
01:01:45,167 --> 01:01:46,294
You will definitely lose, if you fight.

781
01:01:47,211 --> 01:01:48,295
It's not that sleep kung fu is so lousy,

782
01:01:49,518 --> 01:01:51,116
my intellect is too low

783
01:01:51,627 --> 01:01:52,961
The reason why I am here

784
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:55,211
is to find a cure for my mother.

785
01:01:56,511 --> 01:01:58,408
The worm that you wanted to give me the last
time, do you still want to give it to me?

786
01:01:58,877 --> 01:01:59,545
You're not afraid any more?

787
01:01:59,877 --> 01:02:00,378
Not any more.

788
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:04,010
Here!

789
01:02:05,753 --> 01:02:06,711
I'm not afraid...

790
01:02:07,044 --> 01:02:09,795
Is because I know when it grows,
it'll become a butterfly

791
01:02:11,378 --> 01:02:13,087
Now, it can only crawl on the ground

792
01:02:13,254 --> 01:02:14,629
But if it turns into a butterfly,

793
01:02:14,919 --> 01:02:16,628
It can fly in the air.

794
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:21,753
It's like stepping into another dimension.

795
01:02:22,796 --> 01:02:24,004
Man sleeps and dreams

796
01:02:24,296 --> 01:02:26,213
is also like going into another dimension?

797
01:02:27,171 --> 01:02:27,754
Dreams?

798
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:29,255
Butterflies?

799
01:02:29,546 --> 01:02:30,629
Another dimension?

800
01:02:32,296 --> 01:02:33,045
It's like this,

801
01:02:34,713 --> 01:02:36,712
Imagine your mother's illness is cured

802
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:38,296
and you feel very good.

803
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:40,170
You are like the leaves.

804
01:02:42,841 --> 01:02:47,214
Floating in the wind,
just like butterflies

805
01:02:47,381 --> 01:02:49,860
going where it wants to go.

806
01:03:00,547 --> 01:03:03,381
Aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh...

807
01:03:04,464 --> 01:03:05,214
Thank you.

808
01:03:05,506 --> 01:03:07,006
I felt my heart cleared a lot.

809
01:03:08,215 --> 01:03:12,631
Heaven and man are one!

810
01:03:13,715 --> 01:03:15,881
Such a beautiful leaf.

811
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:18,132
Let me have a look.

812
01:03:18,715 --> 01:03:20,548
I'm not letting you see.

813
01:03:23,175 --> 01:03:24,327
Brother Sui,

814
01:03:25,133 --> 01:03:28,322
if one is to die,

815
01:03:29,090 --> 01:03:31,839
won't it be like sleeping?

816
01:03:33,841 --> 01:03:35,315
What I mean is,

817
01:03:36,048 --> 01:03:38,064
maybe one day,
I'm to leave this world

818
01:03:38,382 --> 01:03:41,810
will we meet in another place?

819
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:43,508
Young lady, what nonsense are you talking?

820
01:03:44,009 --> 01:03:45,342
I've got a strange sickness

821
01:03:46,092 --> 01:03:47,008
It's genetic

822
01:03:48,009 --> 01:03:50,008
Can't be cured.

823
01:03:50,676 --> 01:03:52,400
My mother and grandmother

824
01:03:52,884 --> 01:03:54,298
died because of this sickness

825
01:03:55,091 --> 01:03:57,340
They died very young.

826
01:04:02,801 --> 01:04:04,757
I'm not afraid of death.

827
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:08,718
I just hate myself for being useless.

828
01:04:09,217 --> 01:04:09,843
No...

829
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:12,342
You won't die.

830
01:04:13,593 --> 01:04:14,843
You really won't die.

831
01:04:17,301 --> 01:04:19,575
Okay, no more unhappy talk.

832
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:21,927
Now, when I am healthy

833
01:04:22,386 --> 01:04:24,120
I have a great desire.

834
01:04:24,886 --> 01:04:25,885
Tomorrow's final match,

835
01:04:26,385 --> 01:04:27,385
want to have a good match with you.

836
01:04:27,927 --> 01:04:31,175
Just like me and my classmates,
attending a graduation ceremony.

837
01:04:31,563 --> 01:04:32,761
OK?

838
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:34,134
OK.

839
01:04:35,459 --> 01:04:38,051
Man of your words
You have to keep your word.

840
01:04:38,756 --> 01:04:40,754
Liars are dogs!

841
01:04:56,219 --> 01:04:57,886
Do you know that
there are 3 treasure mountains?

842
01:04:58,178 --> 01:04:59,384
The fourth verse is 'thunder and fire'

843
01:04:59,385 --> 01:05:00,596
should be Thunder and Fire hall.

844
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:03,845
In the dancing clouds,
must be 'Music and Dance'

845
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:06,720
If "Between the Dancing Clouds" means
the golden top of Cloud Sea

846
01:05:06,887 --> 01:05:08,720
Take a look.

847
01:05:11,225 --> 01:05:13,124
The North Star & Seven Constellation

848
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:15,179
Outside the cave of the Eight
Meridian hides the black leader.

849
01:05:15,387 --> 01:05:17,055
This place is outside
the Eight Meridian Cave

850
01:05:17,138 --> 01:05:19,472
and where Ho Shou Wu grows the most lush.

851
01:05:20,263 --> 01:05:22,222
Isn't Ho Shou Wu the treasure?

852
01:05:22,306 --> 01:05:24,221
How can the treasure
be found all over the mountain?

853
01:05:25,555 --> 01:05:26,679
Are you Ho Shou Wu?

854
01:05:27,429 --> 01:05:28,346
Are you?

855
01:05:28,637 --> 01:05:29,305
Are you?

856
01:05:30,513 --> 01:05:33,263
Actually, what we are finding is
the ground of Wudang's spirit.

857
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:36,430
Legend has it that it sticks to
the roots of Ho Shou Wu

858
01:05:36,679 --> 01:05:39,498
just like the veins of the human body.
Likewise, connecting to every mountain in Wudang.

859
01:05:40,056 --> 01:05:41,222
What's more magical,

860
01:05:41,556 --> 01:05:43,056
they can sense the human heart

861
01:05:43,057 --> 01:05:43,972
change into human shape.

862
01:05:44,848 --> 01:05:45,556
But,

863
01:05:46,806 --> 01:05:47,722
do you feel that,

864
01:05:48,222 --> 01:05:50,223
we got hold of these treasures too easily?

865
01:05:50,988 --> 01:05:52,885
Furthermore, our treasure
maps are identical

866
01:05:53,221 --> 01:05:54,222
That is why...

867
01:05:54,847 --> 01:05:56,055
you suspect that the map...

868
01:05:57,514 --> 01:05:59,223
Maybe, I'm too suspicious

869
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:01,931
I've lost confidence in man
and lots of things

870
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:05,307
At least you believe that the
heavenly pill can resurrect the dead

871
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:07,307
I'm researching science,

872
01:06:07,932 --> 01:06:10,474
don't believe what that cannot be
scientifically proven.

873
01:06:11,098 --> 01:06:12,430
But later I discover

874
01:06:12,431 --> 01:06:14,766
that many things can't be
explained with science

875
01:06:15,724 --> 01:06:18,391
and many sickness that cannot be
treated with science

876
01:06:20,724 --> 01:06:22,599
I really want to find the spirit
of the Ho Shou Wu

877
01:06:23,224 --> 01:06:25,057
but there are no leads.

878
01:06:27,641 --> 01:06:28,972
Didn't you just said that Ho Shou Wu

879
01:06:28,973 --> 01:06:30,349
can sense the the heart of man?

880
01:06:30,724 --> 01:06:32,725
You can try use your heart to find it.

881
01:06:33,432 --> 01:06:34,891
This is after all a myth.

882
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:36,351
But you said earlier,

883
01:06:36,643 --> 01:06:38,558
There are many things that science
cannot explain.

884
01:06:43,148 --> 01:06:44,637
North Start and the 7 Constellation

885
01:06:45,226 --> 01:06:47,309
I remembered what my grandfather told me

886
01:06:49,268 --> 01:06:50,932
Every time a family member leaves

887
01:06:51,183 --> 01:06:52,725
They will turn into a star

888
01:06:53,225 --> 01:06:55,224
To protect their closest kin.

889
01:06:58,143 --> 01:06:59,559
So when I have a wish,

890
01:06:59,809 --> 01:07:01,769
I will make a wish upon the star.

891
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:05,352
Please try it.

892
01:07:49,728 --> 01:07:50,853
It really appears.

893
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:54,270
Honest heart makes the spirit appears.

894
01:08:12,104 --> 01:08:13,605
It's written in the Trees and Grass log,

895
01:08:14,564 --> 01:08:16,481
that red is the female and
white is the male

896
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:19,188
Can't imagine that a husband and wife
pair appears.

897
01:08:36,232 --> 01:08:36,856
Caught them!

898
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:55,940
Smells good.

899
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:58,941
Ning Er, you've arrived.

900
01:09:00,899 --> 01:09:01,899
Where is Brother Sui?

901
01:09:03,148 --> 01:09:04,398
He went to pick firewood.

902
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:16,690
Heavenly Emperor, please bless

903
01:09:17,566 --> 01:09:19,274
bless Ning Er's sickness
will soon be cured.

904
01:09:20,857 --> 01:09:21,942
I am willing to have her

905
01:09:22,566 --> 01:09:23,608
sickness instead of her.

906
01:09:25,191 --> 01:09:25,942
I beg you.

907
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:54,902
Hungry?

908
01:09:55,485 --> 01:09:56,027
Let's go.

909
01:10:18,985 --> 01:10:21,236
I came to find my father,
Professor Tang Yun Long.

910
01:10:21,653 --> 01:10:23,444
Can you ask him to come out for a while?

911
01:10:24,069 --> 01:10:25,070
We are also looking for him.

912
01:10:25,861 --> 01:10:26,902
Please go back to your bedroom.

913
01:10:27,111 --> 01:10:27,945
Don't come out.

914
01:10:43,403 --> 01:10:45,487
Your father won't come back tonight.

915
01:10:46,737 --> 01:10:47,486
He is alright.

916
01:10:48,113 --> 01:10:49,488
He is just afraid
that you might be worried

917
01:10:49,696 --> 01:10:51,197
That's why he asked me to come
and see you.

918
01:10:52,862 --> 01:10:53,696
I know.

919
01:10:54,405 --> 01:10:55,571
I'll take good care of myself.

920
01:10:57,738 --> 01:10:58,696
Sister Tien Xin,

921
01:10:59,613 --> 01:11:01,071
I'm really lucky.

922
01:11:02,072 --> 01:11:03,406
Tommorrow, I will be in the finals.

923
01:11:04,571 --> 01:11:05,488
Daddy...

924
01:11:09,073 --> 01:11:10,198
can he come and watch?

925
01:11:15,572 --> 01:11:16,364
Ning Er,

926
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:21,572
Your daddy is stealing the treasures
because of you

927
01:11:22,072 --> 01:11:23,155
Do you know that?

928
01:11:25,614 --> 01:11:26,448
I know.

929
01:11:28,032 --> 01:11:28,782
Now,

930
01:11:29,532 --> 01:11:30,782
A lot of priests are looking for him.

931
01:11:33,115 --> 01:11:34,865
My father is a great person.

932
01:11:37,573 --> 01:11:38,782
But this time

933
01:11:41,156 --> 01:11:43,115
He steals from others,
all because of me

934
01:12:01,866 --> 01:12:03,199
Sleep early,

935
01:12:03,241 --> 01:12:04,700
you have a match tomorrow.

936
01:12:05,410 --> 01:12:06,368
I'm scared...

937
01:12:09,493 --> 01:12:10,783
Do you believe in miracles?

938
01:12:16,825 --> 01:12:17,784
Before,

939
01:12:18,158 --> 01:12:19,366
I always thought,

940
01:12:20,409 --> 01:12:21,701
if you only have faith,

941
01:12:22,826 --> 01:12:24,242
and with hope in the heart,

942
01:12:25,535 --> 01:12:27,493
Then I will have a good life.

943
01:12:29,493 --> 01:12:30,410
Now I discovered,

944
01:12:31,909 --> 01:12:35,160
you can't change reality
with faith and hope.

945
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:37,326
Sister Tien Xin,

946
01:12:38,909 --> 01:12:40,117
look at my dad ...

947
01:12:41,913 --> 01:12:45,294
He don't believe in miracles before

948
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:48,952
but now he does because of me.

949
01:12:49,785 --> 01:12:50,744
You...

950
01:12:51,911 --> 01:12:54,327
are a little girl living a hard life

951
01:12:55,452 --> 01:12:56,743
Just like your dad.

952
01:12:57,743 --> 01:12:59,202
He's actually hiding...

953
01:12:59,911 --> 01:13:01,703
but in front of you

954
01:13:01,994 --> 01:13:04,454
he had to act nonchalant and smile.

955
01:13:04,995 --> 01:13:05,829
Sister Tien Xin,

956
01:13:08,161 --> 01:13:10,411
can you do me a favor?

957
01:13:11,536 --> 01:13:14,078
Help me realize my last wish.

958
01:13:14,911 --> 01:13:16,328
Don't say sad things.

959
01:13:17,703 --> 01:13:18,703
You just have to keep on living

960
01:13:18,744 --> 01:13:19,953
and I'll help you with anything.

961
01:13:21,161 --> 01:13:21,953
You have to keep your word.

962
01:13:23,413 --> 01:13:24,663
Get married to my dad.

963
01:13:28,413 --> 01:13:29,870
After my mother died

964
01:13:30,454 --> 01:13:31,288
my dad...

965
01:13:31,955 --> 01:13:32,955
seldom smile.

966
01:13:34,413 --> 01:13:35,496
But I can tell,

967
01:13:36,413 --> 01:13:38,120
when you are with him

968
01:13:38,912 --> 01:13:40,121
He is very happy.

969
01:13:42,746 --> 01:13:43,413
This...

970
01:13:44,414 --> 01:13:46,247
I hate to be tied down.

971
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:48,580
I can't help you with this.

972
01:13:55,122 --> 01:13:56,038
I'm frightened...

973
01:13:57,925 --> 01:13:59,922
maybe one day,

974
01:14:00,414 --> 01:14:02,748
only my daddy is left in this world

975
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:05,248
I really ...

976
01:14:06,164 --> 01:14:07,955
I really don't want to
abandon him

977
01:14:10,747 --> 01:14:13,580
You are crying again?
Poor child...

978
01:14:17,415 --> 01:14:19,747
Your dad won't be left alone, ok?

979
01:14:37,331 --> 01:14:38,748
"Golden Hall"

980
01:14:50,749 --> 01:14:51,500
Great master,

981
01:14:52,792 --> 01:14:53,499
indeed,

982
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,250
they hide in high places,

983
01:14:55,792 --> 01:14:56,917
where they can be found.

984
01:15:01,417 --> 01:15:02,501
We'll talk after we go down the mountain.

985
01:15:03,543 --> 01:15:04,500
Go down the mountain?

986
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:06,625
I just climbed up!

987
01:15:08,251 --> 01:15:10,083
Tang Yun Long and
the girl have disappeared.

988
01:15:11,208 --> 01:15:14,083
Do you think they've taken
the treasures and ran off?

989
01:15:14,919 --> 01:15:17,917
His daughter is here.
He can't run away

990
01:15:18,333 --> 01:15:19,918
I say we kill Tang Yun Long,

991
01:15:20,377 --> 01:15:21,919
take one or two treasure
and that will be enough.

992
01:15:22,043 --> 01:15:22,585
No way.

993
01:15:23,418 --> 01:15:25,252
The 7 treasures have to be
gathered together at the same time

994
01:15:26,169 --> 01:15:27,252
it's value

995
01:15:27,877 --> 01:15:30,543
weighs more that power and riches.

996
01:15:32,918 --> 01:15:34,876
The treasure map that we created,

997
01:15:35,042 --> 01:15:36,418
and distributed to the world.

998
01:15:37,251 --> 01:15:39,085
Not only attracts Tang Yun Long,

999
01:15:39,586 --> 01:15:41,419
and the thing that have been
missing for many years,

1000
01:15:41,752 --> 01:15:43,252
Stilling Wind Pearl.

1001
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:50,003
Brother Sui,

1002
01:15:50,754 --> 01:15:53,211
Today we can finally stand here together.

1003
01:15:54,253 --> 01:15:54,920
Ning Er,

1004
01:15:55,753 --> 01:15:57,129
Can we not fight?

1005
01:15:58,045 --> 01:15:59,129
I'll admit defeat.

1006
01:16:00,421 --> 01:16:01,421
You promised me.

1007
01:16:02,306 --> 01:16:03,705
Man of your words

1008
01:16:04,170 --> 01:16:05,545
You have to keep your word.

1009
01:16:06,102 --> 01:16:08,300
Liars are dogs

1010
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:32,005
Don't, don't ...

1011
01:17:07,964 --> 01:17:08,673
Don't fight anymore.

1012
01:17:11,423 --> 01:17:11,964
Ning Er.

1013
01:17:13,506 --> 01:17:14,592
In the ring...

1014
01:17:15,382 --> 01:17:16,758
if I can stand for one more minute

1015
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:19,591
I'll live for one minute more.

1016
01:17:29,965 --> 01:17:30,716
Fight

1017
01:17:33,716 --> 01:17:34,592
Let's fight.

1018
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:35,758
OK.

1019
01:18:32,803 --> 01:18:34,136
It is clearly a stone sword.

1020
01:18:34,303 --> 01:18:35,802
Why call it a sacred sword?

1021
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:45,428
A very mysterious magnetic mineral.

1022
01:18:45,803 --> 01:18:47,303
There is nothing like that on earth.

1023
01:18:47,929 --> 01:18:48,595
Pardon me.

1024
01:19:15,804 --> 01:19:16,472
Look!

1025
01:19:17,013 --> 01:19:18,722
This is the symbol of our tribe.

1026
01:19:29,013 --> 01:19:31,221
Now we go to Golden Peak Hall
to take the Thunder Needle

1027
01:19:31,222 --> 01:19:32,513
the only thing left is the
Stilling Wind Pearl.

1028
01:19:33,264 --> 01:19:34,181
Don't go just yet.

1029
01:19:34,264 --> 01:19:35,846
I heard that the Thunder Needle
will invoke thunder

1030
01:19:35,847 --> 01:19:36,764
Very dangerous.

1031
01:19:37,152 --> 01:19:40,250
Thunder Needle is to attract electricity from
the thunder and disperse it into the ground

1032
01:19:40,805 --> 01:19:42,471
That is why, gold from the Golden Hall

1033
01:19:42,472 --> 01:19:43,932
for 500 years have been having
thunder and lightning,

1034
01:19:44,057 --> 01:19:45,264
It still remains intact.

1035
01:19:46,348 --> 01:19:47,598
You've got the sacred sword

1036
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:50,190
You intent to go home now?

1037
01:19:51,390 --> 01:19:53,265
I'll definitely take the sacred sword home.

1038
01:19:53,432 --> 01:19:54,723
But not now...

1039
01:19:55,473 --> 01:19:56,641
I promised Ning Er

1040
01:19:57,264 --> 01:19:58,848
I'll wait for her sickness to
be cured first

1041
01:20:01,098 --> 01:20:02,598
She already knows...

1042
01:20:03,057 --> 01:20:03,857
Hmm.

1043
01:20:04,876 --> 01:20:05,450
I thought I can hide it from her

1044
01:20:05,848 --> 01:20:08,098
and let her live happily while
she is still alive.

1045
01:20:08,432 --> 01:20:09,974
That's why, even though her sickness
have worsen,

1046
01:20:10,266 --> 01:20:11,600
she still kept it from you.

1047
01:20:11,683 --> 01:20:12,934
And let you be happier.

1048
01:20:14,308 --> 01:20:15,850
Ning Er is an understanding child.

1049
01:20:28,517 --> 01:20:29,643
Bring the golden needle here.

1050
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:33,100
Ning Er.

1051
01:20:33,893 --> 01:20:34,518
Taoist Xie.

1052
01:20:35,975 --> 01:20:36,934
This is not internal injury

1053
01:20:37,601 --> 01:20:38,850
It's a strange sickness.

1054
01:20:39,342 --> 01:20:40,642
Pulses are in disarray.

1055
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:42,893
Internal organs are bleeding.

1056
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:44,267
Taoist Xie,

1057
01:20:45,267 --> 01:20:46,518
Even my mother's sickness can be cured.

1058
01:20:47,477 --> 01:20:49,435
You certainly have a way to
cure Ning Er.

1059
01:20:50,102 --> 01:20:51,851
In luck there is a high and a low,

1060
01:20:52,434 --> 01:20:54,601
There is also long and short life.

1061
01:20:57,143 --> 01:20:57,768
Ning Er

1062
01:20:58,768 --> 01:20:59,435
Ning Er!

1063
01:21:00,935 --> 01:21:01,935
Ning Er.

1064
01:21:01,976 --> 01:21:02,644
Ning Er.

1065
01:21:03,893 --> 01:21:04,434
Ning Er.

1066
01:21:05,227 --> 01:21:05,893
Dad is here.

1067
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:06,603
Dad.

1068
01:21:07,603 --> 01:21:08,268
Ning Er.

1069
01:21:08,936 --> 01:21:11,019
This time I did listen to you

1070
01:21:12,269 --> 01:21:13,269
I've lost the match.

1071
01:21:13,769 --> 01:21:14,978
From now on...

1072
01:21:17,478 --> 01:21:19,353
Don't you have the heavenly pill
that can resurrect the dead?

1073
01:21:19,603 --> 01:21:20,685
What are you thinking about?

1074
01:21:22,519 --> 01:21:24,144
But the 7 treasures are incomplete

1075
01:21:24,311 --> 01:21:25,600
Don't know if it's effective?

1076
01:21:25,601 --> 01:21:26,436
Don't think so much!

1077
01:21:26,437 --> 01:21:27,978
Just try it!
Quick!

1078
01:21:32,093 --> 01:21:32,493
Tang Yun Long!

1079
01:21:33,019 --> 01:21:34,645
You really came back for your daughter.

1080
01:21:35,145 --> 01:21:36,729
It's time to settle our debt.

1081
01:21:37,603 --> 01:21:38,937
Let me save my daughter first...

1082
01:21:40,104 --> 01:21:41,311
All the treasures are mine!

1083
01:21:41,978 --> 01:21:43,020
Throw the treasures over here.

1084
01:21:43,562 --> 01:21:45,021
Or else I'll kill your daughter first.

1085
01:21:45,729 --> 01:21:46,271
Hurry up!

1086
01:22:03,604 --> 01:22:04,605
Still missing this?

1087
01:22:05,272 --> 01:22:06,271
Am I right?

1088
01:22:06,605 --> 01:22:07,314
White Dragon

1089
01:22:08,523 --> 01:22:10,438
Thunder Needle is a sacred relic
of Golden Peak.

1090
01:22:10,688 --> 01:22:11,897
You're crazy!

1091
01:22:15,272 --> 01:22:16,272
I'm not crazy.

1092
01:22:17,439 --> 01:22:19,605
Everything goes according to my plan.

1093
01:22:20,105 --> 01:22:21,271
This is destiny.

1094
01:22:22,439 --> 01:22:25,272
This is what 'Heaven and Man are One'
really means.

1095
01:22:25,606 --> 01:22:26,981
You want to become the head priest

1096
01:22:27,272 --> 01:22:29,273
you won't have long to wait.

1097
01:22:32,023 --> 01:22:33,981
Do you really think I want
to be the head priest?

1098
01:22:34,774 --> 01:22:37,107
Aiya, you really underestimated me.

1099
01:22:48,107 --> 01:22:50,816
The only thing missing from
Wudang 7 Treasures...

1100
01:22:56,898 --> 01:22:58,732
I've planned for so many years

1101
01:22:59,233 --> 01:23:02,399
just so that someone would send the
Stilling Wind Pearl back to me.

1102
01:23:02,524 --> 01:23:04,109
That's the necklace that grandfather
gave it to me.

1103
01:23:04,775 --> 01:23:06,067
It's really the Stilling Wind Pearl?

1104
01:23:06,441 --> 01:23:09,900
Back then, your father, Tien-Yu and I
came to Wu Dang,

1105
01:23:10,858 --> 01:23:14,484
To retrieve the sacred relic,
Tsuen Tien Sacred Sword

1106
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,441
Half way he discovered the secret

1107
01:23:20,274 --> 01:23:22,987
that I want to collect the 7 treasures
is to achieve Nirvana.

1108
01:23:24,026 --> 01:23:26,109
That's why he stole the Stilling Wind Pearl

1109
01:23:26,275 --> 01:23:27,776
To spoil my plan.

1110
01:23:29,776 --> 01:23:30,359
But,

1111
01:23:31,442 --> 01:23:32,901
he did not realize,

1112
01:23:33,652 --> 01:23:36,110
that I've actually collected 6 Treasures.

1113
01:23:37,777 --> 01:23:38,693
Finally,

1114
01:23:39,776 --> 01:23:43,111
I just used a shoddy map

1115
01:23:43,777 --> 01:23:45,528
to let her daughter

1116
01:23:46,111 --> 01:23:48,402
to bring back the Stilling Wind Pearl.

1117
01:23:49,162 --> 01:23:52,193
To reach nirvana takes practice.

1118
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:53,276
White Dragon

1119
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:56,776
what you're doing is demonic.

1120
01:24:26,362 --> 01:24:27,446
Ning Er is dying.

1121
01:24:29,070 --> 01:24:29,654
Ning Er.

1122
01:24:31,904 --> 01:24:32,654
Ning Er.

1123
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:34,280
I'm frightened...

1124
01:24:36,113 --> 01:24:36,862
Don't be afraid.

1125
01:24:41,239 --> 01:24:43,281
7 Treasures put together,

1126
01:24:44,154 --> 01:24:46,655
I can finally attain Nirvana.

1127
01:24:47,947 --> 01:24:50,154
7 Treasures are leaving the mountain

1128
01:24:50,822 --> 01:24:52,488
Yin and Yang have lost it's balance.

1129
01:24:53,113 --> 01:24:55,780
I dreamt of Wudang's disaster

1130
01:24:56,613 --> 01:24:58,238
It has really came.

1131
01:24:59,489 --> 01:25:01,364
No one can stop me anymore.

1132
01:25:01,781 --> 01:25:03,281
Heavenly Pill in orbit,

1133
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:06,030
will be completed in time.

1134
01:25:06,864 --> 01:25:08,031
Very soon,

1135
01:25:08,739 --> 01:25:10,447
I will attain nirvana.

1136
01:25:18,531 --> 01:25:19,323
Taoist Xie,

1137
01:25:19,739 --> 01:25:20,824
Ning Er can't hang on much longer.

1138
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:22,489
We have to quickly snatch back
the Heavenly Pill.

1139
01:25:23,156 --> 01:25:25,116
The highest stage of Sleep Kung Fu is

1140
01:25:25,365 --> 01:25:26,864
"Body without Attachment"

1141
01:25:27,115 --> 01:25:28,365
Spirit becomes nothingness.

1142
01:25:29,116 --> 01:25:31,532
Just like the state White Dragon
is in now.

1143
01:25:32,115 --> 01:25:37,658
[In an Altered State of pure Emptiness]

1144
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:45,366
White Dragon,

1145
01:25:46,283 --> 01:25:48,116
no one ever dare to fool me before!

1146
01:25:48,798 --> 01:25:51,545
We'll have to get the Heavenly Pill back

1147
01:25:53,825 --> 01:25:55,657
Do you want to take a risk
and try?

1148
01:26:13,524 --> 01:26:16,325
Sleep Deity, Sleep Deity.

1149
01:26:16,617 --> 01:26:19,326
When the rock takes hold,
all the years will be forgotten..

1150
01:26:19,577 --> 01:26:22,577
The 3 Rays goes deeper,
your nature will be pure.

1151
01:26:25,203 --> 01:26:28,511
Breathing and relaxation becomes natural.

1152
01:26:50,077 --> 01:26:50,827
Taoist priest!

1153
01:27:42,913 --> 01:27:44,955
Quick, use the Heavenly Pill
to save Ning Er.

1154
01:31:27,176 --> 01:31:28,759
Mere mortals!

1155
01:31:30,467 --> 01:31:32,217
How can you compete with me!

1156
01:33:17,622 --> 01:33:18,620
Daughter

1157
01:33:31,808 --> 01:33:39,888
Daddy! Daddy...
Daddy...

1158
01:33:39,889 --> 01:33:40,640
Ning Er

1159
01:33:41,201 --> 01:33:43,641
It's alright now.

1160
01:33:46,349 --> 01:33:47,015
Tien Xin.

1161
01:33:47,933 --> 01:33:48,641
Tien Xin.

1162
01:33:50,973 --> 01:33:51,682
Tien Xin.

1163
01:33:54,088 --> 01:33:55,286
Tang Yun Lon

1164
01:33:56,307 --> 01:33:58,307
You are a tough man,

1165
01:33:59,723 --> 01:34:01,558
but once mention about your daughter,

1166
01:34:02,974 --> 01:34:04,933
you became soft.

1167
01:34:06,350 --> 01:34:07,183
Sister Tien Xin,

1168
01:34:24,226 --> 01:34:25,475
Sacred Sword

1169
01:34:27,476 --> 01:34:30,142
Let it remain in Wudang Mountain.

1170
01:34:35,810 --> 01:34:37,684
I have no need to go home now.

1171
01:34:39,852 --> 01:34:41,227
Because the sacred sword

1172
01:34:41,935 --> 01:34:44,019
has its own home now.

1173
01:34:45,811 --> 01:34:46,852
My heart,

1174
01:34:47,310 --> 01:34:48,520
also have a home now.

1175
01:34:52,645 --> 01:34:53,559
Thank you...

1176
01:34:54,142 --> 01:34:55,060
guys.

1177

Sister Tien Xin

1178
01:34:59,144 --> 01:35:00,144
Sister Tien Xin.

1179
01:35:02,019 --> 01:35:03,103
Sister Tien Xin

1180
01:35:03,686 --> 01:35:04,478
Sister Tien Xin

1181
01:35:06,477 --> 01:35:07,936
Sister Tien Xin

1182
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:14,978
Thursday she held in the hand
\ NLA treasure map game.

1183
01:35:16,144 --> 01:35:17,478
What treasure map?

1184
01:35:18,062 --> 01:35:19,187
She came to steal the sacred sword?

1185
01:35:19,188 --> 01:35:21,188
The sacred sword originally
belongs to our tribe.

1186
01:35:21,979 --> 01:35:24,395
The biggest mistake in your life
is to despise...

1187
01:35:25,145 --> 01:35:26,186
I am just joking.

1188
01:35:26,478 --> 01:35:27,979
Wudang have many skilled pugilists.

1189
01:35:28,187 --> 01:35:29,979
You've better be careful.

1190
01:35:33,562 --> 01:35:35,812
I remembered grandfather once told me,

1191
01:35:36,853 --> 01:35:38,729
Whenever a kin leaves,

1192
01:35:39,479 --> 01:35:41,146
They will turn into stars

1193
01:35:42,688 --> 01:35:44,814
To protect their closest kin.

1194
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:04,858
Sister Tien Xin.
