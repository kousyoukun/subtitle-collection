00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,210
Newspaper.

2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,775
Newspaper.

3
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,578
Newspaper, today's news.

4
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,175
Newspaper.

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,091
Newspaper.

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,137
Hi Joe.

7
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,456
Hi James.

8
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:33,457
Where are you going?

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,130
Dad, I saw your picture.

10
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,779
You used to plait your hair.

11
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,694
Qing Dynasty was still in power when I was
studying abroad.

12
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,972
The RC Government then ordered people to
cut their plait.

13
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,619
Still conservative people

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,215
can't accept that China's changed.

15
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,249
Aren't we going to Wu Dang Mt?

16
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,580
The train will set off in 2 hours.

17
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,808
Why are we here in the leased territory?

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,460
Heard that the thing we've been looking for

19
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,815
is here. I have to find out.

20
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,370
Dad, what's so important?

21
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,530
Wait here. I'll be right back.

22
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,458
Wang, take care of her.

23
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,408
You said you won't leave me.

24
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,291
Don't worry.

25
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,450
I won't ever leave you.

26
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,015
- Are you Prof.Tang?
- Yes.

27
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:38,812
Please.

28
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,293
Prof. Tang, thanks for coming to examine it.

29
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,495
You're welcome.

30
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,338
I've studied it for years.

31
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,533
I'm very glad to be able to see it.

32
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,176
Prof.Tang, nice to meet you.

33
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,859
You too, Mr. Paul Chen.

34
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,578
You're famous for collecting goodies
worldwide.

35
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,291
Now you've even got Xuan Tian Sword.

36
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,016
It was made two thousand years ago.

37
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,650
Thanks to its mysterious power

38
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,820
Tang became a magnificent country.

39
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,253
Prof.Tang, please.

40
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,729
It was made of meteoric stone

41
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,733
that has an unique magnetic field.

42
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,651
It belonged to a mysterious clan

43
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,649
but they lost it after being wiped out in wars.

44
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,894
Said it appeared once on Wu Dang Mt.

45
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,899
Your Highness, you can have it for 300000
dollars.

46
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,740
If you bring it back to China, it'll be worth a lot
more.

47
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,413
Prof.Tang, you...

48
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,969
Seven spirits on the mountain. Zhenjing
sleeps on Tiandan.

49
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,528
Wushou hidden outside Ba Mai Cave.
Precious bead of Lei Huo on the clouds.

50
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,810
Seems like it's true.

51
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,729
This Sword is only one of the 7 Treasures.

52
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,575
What did you say, 7 Treasures?

53
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,971
Is this a treasure map?

54
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,935
Tang Yunlong, what are you up to?

55
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,657
I should be asking you.

56
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,575
This Xuan Tian Sword is fake.

57
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,980
Paul Chen, dare you fool me!

58
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,971
You guys could be in cahoots.

59
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,009
Whatever...

60
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,097
you've destroyed my sword.

61
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,409
You've got to pay for it.

62
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,294
Go get the map.

63
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,530
Wang, let's go.

64
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,220
Dad, you in a fight?

65
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,812
I'm fine. Let's go to the station, hurry.

66
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,937
while men are fighting at the borders.

67
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:34,653
They do the weaving at home.

68
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,769
They farm on days and weave at nights.

69
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,089
They work all day and all night.

70
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,334
So soldiers have things to eat and clothes to
wear.

71
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,858
Look at me now if you don't believe.

72
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,500
Look at all of them.

73
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,060
Our shoes, socks, and clothes

74
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,574
Ms. Why staring at me like that?

75
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,210
Are you fond of me?

76
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,769
You represent Beijing to attend the WDM
Martial Arts Competition?

77
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,975
I'm the most handsome martial artist in Beijing
and Tianjin.

78
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,853
Pretty things on a pretty girl.

79
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,973
Leave her alone.

80
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,330
Don't be afraid.

81
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,529
You're going to Hubei, what for?

82
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,096
To steal.

83
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,612
Interesting.

84
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,496
Steal what?

85
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,811
Steal an invitation card.

86
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,535
Like this one.

87
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,739
You want to steal my invitation card?

88
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,940
You want to go to the competition instead of
me?

89
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,979
You should either go home or go to the
hospital.

90
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,371
Dare you talk to me like that.

91
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,538
Who's going to represent Wu Dang to attend
the competition?

92
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,652
Has our Mentor decided yet?

93
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:07,856
Bailong, he's sleeping. Don't bother him. Let's
go.

94
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,253
Not yet arrived.

95
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,810
Who's he waiting for?

96
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:52,851
Watch out, Ning.

97
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:58,851
You okay?

98
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,695
Go.

99
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,299
What a careless guys!

100
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,928
Popped up out of nowhere.

101
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,411
What's wrong?

102
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,138
It's down. We have to continue on foot.

103
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,017
Okay.

104
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,574
Dad, was that a Taoist?

105
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,496
I think so.

106
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,732
I think he's kind. Let's go.

107
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,616
Shui Heyi, you're late.

108
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,732
Bro, I...

109
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,855
Why so little water?

110
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,338
Bro, I came across a motorbike on the way.

111
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,340
It almost ran me over so...

112
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,500
Don't be lying.

113
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,173
You know how strict Bailong is, right?

114
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,736
Go clean out the grass over there.

115
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,296
Sure.

116
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,774
Hi, we're attending the competition.

117
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,579
Master Xie's gone.

118
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,740
- Let's go, hurry.
- What happened?

119
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,331
Master Xie's gone.

120
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,889
Our Mentor's gone.

121
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,170
Excuse me.

122
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,372
His heartbeat has stopped.

123
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,818
Our Mentor's gone. We're all sad.

124
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,738
Life's short.

125
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:08,731
I think he's gone to Heaven.

126
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,576
Who is he?

127
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,018
He's Tang Yunlong, the sponsor for the
competition.

128
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,730
His vital signs are all gone

129
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,532
but I guess he's breathing like a tortoise.

130
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,489
Scientifically speaking, he's hibernating.

131
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,170
Hibernating.

132
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,294
Yeah, sort of in a conscious sleep.

133
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,691
He's so unpredictable.

134
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:45,693
Master Xie... Xie's awake.

135
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,735
Master, you're awake.

136
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:55,176
Thank God. You're here finally.

137
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,575
Guys, Shui Heyi will represent Wu Dang.

138
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,850
Awesome. You made him awake.

139
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:03,936
It's you.

140
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,491
Shui Heyi's a secular man.

141
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,371
He knows just a little bit of martial arts.

142
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,339
He's not a senior. He can't.

143
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,935
Right, Master Xie.

144
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,372
I'm not skiIful at all.

145
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,500
I just want to spend time with my mother

146
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,250
and take care of her illness.

147
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,374
I can't represent Wu Dang to attend the
competition.

148
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:33,175
The useless are the most useful. Nothing is
impossible.

149
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:38,297
Master, if you let him, we'll lose.

150
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,100
This event takes place once every 500 years.

151
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,898
We can't afford to lose.

152
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:51,211
If you're too desperate to win, you'll lose.

153
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,213
Go get ready for the competition.

154
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,413
No. I should talk to my mother first.

155
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,178
Is there a treasure map in your hands?

156
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,534
No, there isn't.

157
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,820
You're here to steal something?

158
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,855
I'm sorry, Taoist Master, I'm lost.

159
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,812
Is this Xiao Yao Palace?

160
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,416
I'm not a Taoist Master.

161
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,654
A Taoist Master's over there, Ma'am.

162
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,413
Hi there.

163
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,532
I'm the representative of Beijing-Tianjin.

164
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,974
I'm here for the competition.

165
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,208
My brother's sick.

166
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,172
So I came instead of him.

167
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,418
My name's Tianxin, not Ma'am.

168
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,695
To celebrate 500th anniversary of the
re-establishment of...

169
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,090
Wu Long Palace on Wu Dang Mt.

170
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:00,090
We're holding this competition for Taoist
juniors

171
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,015
from all over the country

172
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,537
and overseas Chinese organizations.

173
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,976
It's to promote Taoist martial arts

174
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,813
and encourage youngsters

175
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,731
to communicate and learn from each other.

176
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,576
Now, please welcome Wei Chunyang for Kong
Dong Clan, Sichuan.

177
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,340
His opponent is from Beijing-Tianjin of Henan
and Hebei

178
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,296
the representative of Long Men Clan, Tianxin.

179
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,015
I don't fight women. Go home.

180
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,216
This could be the biggest mistake you've ever
made.

181
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,255
That's called Paocui.

182
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,138
If you get hit by that, you'll be in trouble.

183
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,088
If you're up against a man like that

184
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,179
don't fight, just admit defeat.

185
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,090
You think she's going to lose?

186
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,291
Good.

187
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:58,136
Is she playing Tai Chi? What is that?

188
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:16,418
Is that Zhang Sangfeng's Changsijing?

189
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,534
Not quite.

190
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:21,890
Changsijing?

191
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,380
Good.

192
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,017
Tianxin won.

193
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,490
Good.

194
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,651
Second match,

195
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,699
Tangning for the ATA

196
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,060
- Dear,
- versus Wanglei for Shang Qing
Clan, Taiwan.

197
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,660
you're here to learn.

198
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,620
Take it easy.

199
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,292
- Taiyi Five Elements Form versus Silken Palms.
- Admit defeat if you can't win.

200
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,449
Dad, you've said it many times.

201
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,011
Alright, I'll give you signs.

202
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:46,737
Tangning won.

203
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,379
Good.

204
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:53,932
It hurts?

205
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,412
Hang in there. I'll be gentle.

206
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,329
Dad, was I great back there?

207
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,495
Dare you mention it again.

208
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,451
I told you to take it easy, didn't I?

209
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,332
You played it hard. I was worried.

210
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,018
Why did you tell me not to be serious

211
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,654
while you're indeed serious about everything?

212
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,537
Alright, it's late.

213
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,179
I shall go back to sleep. Good night.

214
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:33,817
Dad,

215
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:38,855
what did mom come down with?

216
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:47,572
I wonder how you got to know her.

217
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,573
I told you, didn't I?

218
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:53,490
I used to plait my hair.

219
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,973
I met your mother in a Chinese restaurant

220
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,089
while I was studying in America.

221
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,893
Alright, it's late. Go to bed.

222
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:15,894
Dad, you're here with a treasure map.

223
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,613
I think you're up to something.

224
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,209
Are we here just to watch and learn Kung fu?

225
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,455
I'll get you a boyfriend.

226
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,495
Don't be kidding.

227
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:32,136
Alright, don't be mad.

228
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,978
Golden Palace. Nan Yan.

229
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:01,573
Seven spirits on the mountain. Wu Long
Palace.

230
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,537
Dad.

231
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:51,217
You should've got married and had kids if your
dad was here.

232
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,770
I'm so weak here.

233
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,770
Mom, you know

234
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:04,168
we're here on Wu Dang Mt, a very spiritual
place.

235
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,530
You will get well for sure.

236
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:11,889
All I want now is to get you a wife.

237
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,691
Dad, you promised me

238
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,849
that we'd be like partners.

239
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,614
I'm not your dad.

240
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,580
- What's going on?
- It's okay, mom.

241
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,933
Be calm.

242
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:39,776
What happened?
- Who is that?

243
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,736
It's you.

244
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,019
Why? You know her?

245
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,931
She's Taoist Xie's guest.

246
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,975
What a girl. Son, you don't have to be a monk
now.

247
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,738
Dear, you alright?

248
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:52,014
Tianxin, Xuan Tian Sword is a holy thing of
ours.

249
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:57,570
It was made of meteoric stone, and powerful.

250
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:03,853
Your dad looked for it for years, but couldn't
find it.

251
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,740
When his body was discovered in the desert

252
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,208
there was such a bead in his hand.

253
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:14,579
It could be related with the Sword's
whereabouts.

254
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:23,260
You must finish what you dad didn't when you
grow up.

255
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,131
You theif.

256
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,376
Got a partner huh?

257
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,377
Hurry.

258
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,213
Dear, you're awake.

259
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,140
You fell from the top.
I was worried

260
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,973
that you might be paralyzed like me.

261
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,569
Sorry for ruining your roofs.

262
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,220
My dad will pay for it.

263
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,017
No need. I've fixed it.

264
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,776
Aren't you the representative of Wu Dang?

265
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,935
I'm one of the participants.
I won a match today.

266
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,532
We may compete against each other in the
future.

267
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,370
I won't attend the competition.

268
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,217
Why?

269
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,929
I have to take care of my mom here.

270
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,420
You should get married soon.

271
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,570
Then you don't have to look after me yourself.

272
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,499
Dear, what's your name?

273
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:23,811
Tangning.

274
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:27,377
Ning, this is my son.

275
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,214
His name's Shui Heyi, not yet married.

276
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,449
How about you?

277
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,898
Mom, she's still young. Don't embarrass her.

278
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,015
She's not I guess.

279
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,655
Mom, time to sleep.

280
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,492
Son, you two are a good match.

281
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,136
I'll fall asleep soon.

282
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,860
You have a good talk. I won't overhear you.

283
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,339
Alright, sleep.

284
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,780
Ms, you must be lost.

285
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,419
You can call me Tangning.

286
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,174
Mosquitoes are bad insects.

287
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,537
Still they're living things like us.
Plus, I promised

288
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,892
not to kill so mom will get well.

289
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,889
When it gets cool at nights, mosquitoes will go
naturally.

290
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,618
We humans are part of the nature.

291
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:48,330
So are mosquitoes and everything else.

292
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,172
Do we secular beings have to learn Taoism?

293
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,535
I'm stupid anyway.

294
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:58,213
Taoist Xie taught me how to reunite with
Heaves

295
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:02,175
and to meditate so as to feel life.

296
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,849
I just can't.

297
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,774
Can you?

298
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,174
I feel like...

299
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,213
I'm losing it.

300
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:35,018
It's you. Aren't you the sponsor?

301
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,608
Glad that I was there.

302
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,091
You would've been caught if not for me.

303
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,211
Nonsense. I saved you.

304
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,536
You wouldn't have escaped if not for my last
powerful strike.

305
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,776
You're here to steal the Sword?

306
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,372
It belongs to my family.

307
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,179
I've been looking for it for years.

308
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,376
Good.

309
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,300
There're 7 treasures here on Wu Dang Mt.

310
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,972
Let's work together and steal them.

311
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,694
You'll get the Sword, and I'll have the rest.

312
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,730
You know how good Bailong is, don't you?

313
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,532
You can't pull it off alone.

314
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,609
Let's work together alright?

315
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,897
Why not? Our motives are different anyway.

316
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,208
I'm here to retrieve what's mine, but you're
here to steal.

317
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,620
I wonder...

318
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,418
why you're here with your daughter. You
almost got her killed.

319
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,497
What? Got her killed?

320
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,937
She mistook me as you back there.

321
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:28,179
She followed me and fell off the cliff.

322
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,095
Don't worry, she probably...

323
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,940
Here's Wu Dang Mt. Any illness can't be
cured.

324
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,497
Ning.

325
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,420
Ning.

326
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,412
Dad, what's wrong with you?

327
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:52,213
You okay? Did you fall off the cliff?

328
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,540
Yes, but I know martial arts.

329
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,939
I'm fine. See?

330
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,975
I was worried sick.

331
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,339
Liukun from Da Mao CIan, Yunnan, won.

332
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:14,976
Next match...

333
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,980
Li Xuande from Quan Zhen Clan, North Korea

334
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,414
versus Zhangyang from Feng Lai Clan,
Shangdong.

335
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,376
Li Xuande won.

336
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:41,180
Last match, Tangning for the ATA

337
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:44,060
Ning, remember admit defeat if you can't win.

338
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,290
- versus Tianxin from Long Men Clan, Beijing-Tianjin.
- Alright.

339
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,415
I will fight hard.

340
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,773
You should do the same. Don't let your dad
down.

341
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:24,538
Come on.

342
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:40,971
I admit defeat.

343
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:45,691
You're better.

344
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,730
Tangning won.

345
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,776
You were lucky. Where are you going?

346
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,730
It's a secret.

347
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,580
Prof.Tang, did you...?

348
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,700
I lost. What a pity!

349
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,060
Sorry, did I hurt you?

350
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,528
Ms Tianxin, did you sleep well last night?

351
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,294
No. I had bad dreams.

352
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,969
Mom, hang in there.

353
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,736
Shui Heyi.

354
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,695
Mom, we're almost there, hold on.

355
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,300
If my guess is right

356
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,450
Bailong is suspicious of both of us.

357
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,736
That's why you deliberately admitted defeat.

358
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,459
You want to act in the broad daylight.

359
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,740
Bailong is kind of busy now.

360
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,857
The Sword is not guarded. We have a better
chance.

361
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,216
The next line indicates our next target.

362
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,900
Zhenjing and Tiandan...

363
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,209
Why not going to steal the Sword?

364
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,180
I'm not that stupid. If you get the Sword, you'll
be gone.

365
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:03,336
Zhenjing could mean Laozi's Daodejing.

366
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,529
It's in Xiao Yao Palace.

367
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,295
Another treasure is Tiandan

368
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:11,455
that's the answer to all illnesses, made by
Physician Zhang.

369
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,849
It's hidden...

370
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,009
The Prince should rest in the bed of Dragon.

371
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,129
No big deal.

372
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,615
It's just Tiandan.

373
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,978
Poetry is nothing difficult.

374
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,459
Let's split up then.

375
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,337
Alright.

376
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,380
If you think

377
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,779
you can do it alone.

378
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,968
How about this? You go get Zhenjing,
I'll go for Tiandan.

379
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,099
Why should I go for Zhenjing?

380
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,540
I've checked.

381
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:43,533
Only two Taoists to guard Xiao Yao Palace. It
should be easy.

382
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,419
The biggest mistake you've ever made...

383
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,010
I'm kidding.

384
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,531
Everyone here is a Master. You better watch
out.

385
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,855
See who'll get it first before the sunset.

386
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,768
Mom, you're awake.

387
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,773
Tangning...

388
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,016
Ma'am.

389
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:37,773
Now she's physically well.
She was just mentally sick.

390
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:45,936
Alright, you can get off the bed and have a
walk.

391
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,300
Have a walk?

392
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:49,937
Give it a try.

393
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,178
Mom, have a try.

394
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,292
One, two, three.

395
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,129
Mom, you can walk now.

396
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,698
- Sit down first.
- I can walk now.

397
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:10,653
Thank God. You're so lucky.

398
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,495
Your mom's all right now.

399
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,576
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

400
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,775
Now you can focus on the competition.

401
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,617
I...

402
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:23,289
No need to be a monk now. Go enjoy the
competition.

403
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,254
Should I thank Taoist Xie.

404
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,177
Yeah I know.

405
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:01,818
Who is it?

406
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:04,617
Get him.

407
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:09,817
Freeze.

408
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,296
Thanks a lot.

409
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:37,134
Master, I'm Zixu from Jiu Tian
Palace on Hua Mt.

410
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,813
Can we have a talk?

411
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,659
Can we have a talk, Master?

412
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,811
Master, be frank with you.

413
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:50,094
Someone stole Laozi's Zhenjing from us.

414
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,020
I think since...

415
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,215
Yinjing... you have Yangjing right?

416
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,414
Our Yinjing has been stolen.

417
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,890
So has your Yangjing right?

418
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,170
I've got you.

419
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:07,979
I've got you, fool.

420
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:21,891
Why no guards?

421
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,372
I shouldn't have wasted my breath.

422
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,491
Could Zhenjing be in this place?

423
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,699
Could this be a trap?

424
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:25,615
What is this? Such a piece of cake.

425
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,458
I shouldn't have wasted time practicing

426
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:30,848
for so long.

427
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,377
Tang Yunlong, you're late.

428
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:50,530
You lost.

429
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,939
Tianxin, you won.

430
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:55,017
You're injured.

431
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,695
You too.

432
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,930
The Taoist you mentioned was awesome.

433
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:02,614
He almost got me.

434
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:06,500
Here. It's rusted.

435
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,728
What's the use of it?

436
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,370
Look.

437
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,179
What's our next target?

438
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,810
Wushou hidden outside Ba Mai Cave.

439
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,529
You said it's simple. Tell me what it means.

440
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,420
It's simple.

441
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:25,897
Yeah.

442
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:31,571
Ba Mai Cave... I think it means two treasures
here.

443
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:35,170
Look... Ba Mai in a cave...

444
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:38,020
Wushou, it could mean the black...

445
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,214
Shouwu.

446
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,970
Wu Dang Mt is a holy place.

447
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,019
Said there're two thousand-year-old
human-like Shouwu.

448
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:51,091
Only two? I guess there's a lot.

449
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,894
They're like a couple fighting a lot.

450
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:57,454
That's why I hate men. I Iike being single.

451
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,255
You women are annoying. I like freedom.

452
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:02,731
We could never be on the same wavelength.

453
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:04,658
I guess you'd sell all your treasures soon

454
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,460
after you get them.

455
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:07,336
I just want to go home.

456
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,700
I'm not that greedy, selfish

457
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,179
and money-minded as you think.

458
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,138
Alright, don't waste my time here.

459
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:16,651
You think you're righteous?

460
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,060
You said the Sword belongs to your family.

461
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:19,856
Prove it.

462
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,180
It does belong to my family.

463
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:23,692
Prove it.

464
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,737
It is mine, believe it or not.

465
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:31,971
I'll get the Sword even without you.

466
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:33,977
Yes, I can.

467
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:48,289
Sleeping Kung fu is the best of Internal Martial
Arts.

468
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,889
Zhuangzi dreams of being a butterfly

469
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:54,497
A butterfly dreams of being Zhuangzi.

470
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:58,012
Our ancestor, Chenbo, once spent 800 years
sleeping

471
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:01,013
during the best times of Song Dynasty.

472
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,739
Su Qier learned in his sleep

473
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:06,569
how to fight in Luohan style.

474
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:18,415
A day will pass in a blink of an eye.

475
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:29,458
A sleeping fairy will forget the time.

476
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:33,336
Concentrate on breaths and be mindful.

477
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:40,819
Let Qi run into Xuanqiao and breathe with the
nature.

478
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:47,420
That's What Master Zhang Sangfeng lectured
on sleeping Kung fu.

479
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:50,253
You should keep it in mind.

480
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:11,775
Something's up in Wo Long Palace.

481
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:15,172
Master's asleep. What happened?

482
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,689
We seven tried to chase him down but failed.

483
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,528
Got to tell Master about it.

484
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:22,139
Someone stole something from Wo Long
Palace.

485
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,376
What did he steal?

486
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:25,138
Nothing seems to be missing

487
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,220
but we saw him

488
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,893
steal something like a sphere.

489
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:35,335
Ma'am, why did you let Shui attend the
competition?

490
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:41,854
We're grateful to Taoist Xie. That's to thank
him.

491
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:51,140
I dreamed of you and Heyi at the altar, getting
married.

492
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:51,731
Getting what?

493
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,969
Nothing.

494
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:59,932
Ning, go open the box beside my bed.

495
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:16,813
Nice. I've never tried Mandarin clothes.

496
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,133
Try them on then.

497
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:24,491
What do you think?

498
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,416
You picked the right one.

499
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:35,619
It's fated. This wedding dress is from my
mom.

500
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:39,331
Nice.

501
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:00,972
Seems like I've disturbed you.

502
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,819
Why are you in my mom's dress?

503
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,655
She gave it to me. Nice?

504
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,858
Yes. Where is my mom?

505
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,296
She's asIeep. I'm here for you.

506
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:13,737
I'm practicing Kung fu. Thanks for taking care
of my mom.

507
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:15,609
My pleasure.

508
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,689
She sleeps like a baby.

509
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:22,536
I told her a story then she fell asleep.

510
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,499
You and your mom are close. So are my dad
and I.

511
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:28,820
He's been teaching me

512
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:29,889
how to fight and live well.

513
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,819
He did some researches.

514
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:35,178
He thinks Taoism is pretty scientific.

515
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,412
I've said too much I guess.

516
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:42,459
Don't worry. I'll come visit your mom as long
as I have time.

517
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:44,496
Show me your hand.

518
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,176
Close your eyes.

519
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:51,573
I once used it to help Taoist Xie out.

520
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:54,371
I'm giving it to you.

521
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:00,416
What's wrong?

522
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:04,092
It's just a little caterpillar. Why so scared?

523
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:05,779
Liukun for Da Mao Clan, Yunnan

524
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:09,137
versus Tangning for the ATA.

525
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:11,172
Honey.

526
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,855
Dad, I feel confident with you here.

527
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:17,648
Tang Yunlong, come with me.

528
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,533
Why? I can't leave now.

529
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:21,210
Look over there.

530
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:23,571
They're looking for you.

531
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:30,289
Don't worry. I'll admit defeat if I can't win.

532
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:31,451
You guys go.

533
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:34,612
Hurry.

534
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,939
Boss, Tang Yunlong's over there.

535
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,420
Follow him. Kill him if necessary.

536
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:05,818
Okay.

537
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:23,180
I'm fine. Don't worry.

538
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:34,220
Wake up, will you?

539
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:35,330
We're being followed.

540
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:45,180
They're not from Wu Dang. Their shoes are
different.

541
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,249
Never mind. Let's go.

542
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:00,410
Tangning won.

543
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:10,212
This should be Ba Mai Cave.

544
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:11,975
Lots of people to welcome us.

545
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:13,620
You sneak in through Long Tou Xiang.

546
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,975
Let's split up and lead them to the woods on
the left.

547
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:51,569
Stop right there.

548
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:01,170
Stop. Don't run.

549
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:19,657
Let's go.

550
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:28,856
This is Ba Mai PaIace, not Ba Mai Cave.

551
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:30,134
It can't be wrong.

552
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,171
It must have something to do with Ba Mai.

553
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:40,616
They're all broken statues, nothing precious.

554
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:41,935
It's got to be around. Let's look for it.

555
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,978
You think you could fool me?

556
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:56,575
I've been waiting for you, Prof.Tang.

557
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:00,377
Go ahead.

558
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:01,377
I...

559
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:04,095
I may lose to a woman.

560
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:05,409
I...

561
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:08,131
I won't tear my clothes up and pretend I'm hurt.

562
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:14,088
You go look for the treasure.

563
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:38,216
Hurry, please.

564
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:40,980
Seriously,

565
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,333
you know what Ba Mai means?

566
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,253
Ba Mai means 8 extraordinary channels of the
body.

567
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:28,856
Got it?

568
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:29,531
Take that.

569
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:32,297
Got it.

570
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:43,570
Tianxin, I've got the gold figure.

571
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:57,179
Tang YunIong, surprised that I'm still alive?

572
00:56:57,340 --> 00:57:00,616
Sorry for hurting your leg.

573
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:04,296
You know you owe me much huh? Give me
that gold figure.

574
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,128
And your bag?

575
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:19,372
Get him.

576
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:48,658
You take it and go. I'll take care of them.

577
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:49,730
I won't leave without you.

578
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:51,290
Let's fight then.

579
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:17,817
Watch out.

580
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,970
Your sleeping Kung fu is lousy. You'll lose.

581
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:48,413
It's just that I'm stupid.

582
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:53,456
I'm only here to want to fix my mom's illness.

583
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:56,818
I'd like to have that caterpillar back.

584
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:57,852
Not afraid?

585
01:01:58,260 --> 01:01:58,692
No.

586
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:01,852
Here.

587
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:04,851
I'm not afraid of it

588
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:08,088
because I know it'll become a butterfly one
day.

589
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:12,737
Now it can only crawl, but soon it'll fly

590
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:14,653
freely in the sky.

591
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:19,938
It's like going to another space.

592
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:22,289
Will men go to another space

593
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:24,451
while dreaming?

594
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:28,890
Dreams, butterflies, another space?

595
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:36,855
Just imagine your mom's recovered, and
you're relieved

596
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:38,653
like a leaf

597
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:43,688
floating in the air.

598
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:47,178
Like a butterfly flying to wherever you want.

599
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:05,135
Thank you. I feel so much better now.

600
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:10,938
Reunite with the nature.

601
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:12,970
What a beautiful leaf.

602
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:15,977
Let me see.

603
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:18,296
No.

604
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:26,608
Shui, you think dying is

605
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,172
like sleeping?

606
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:36,099
I mean, if I die one day

607
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,892
will I meet you in another space?

608
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,172
What are you talking about?

609
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:47,289
I have a genetic strange disease.
It can't be fixed.

610
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:52,771
My mom and grandma all died of it

611
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:54,899
when they were young.

612
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:07,096
I'm not afraid anyway. I just don't want to be
made useless.

613
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:13,258
You won't.
You won't die young either.

614
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:17,651
Alright, let's drop it.

615
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:22,449
I have a wish as a healthy girl here.

616
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:26,019
Let's present a great match tomorrow

617
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:30,128
like you and I attending the graduation
ceremony alright?

618
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:31,491
Sure.

619
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:34,735
You're a man.

620
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:38,735
You should never lie.

621
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:55,859
We've got three of them.

622
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:58,848
Fourth line... Lei Huo...
it should be Lei Huo Palace.

623
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,372
On the clouds... it could mean

624
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:05,577
clouds upon the top of the mountain.

625
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:10,410
The Big Dipper.

626
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:13,572
Shouwu hidden outside Ba Mai Cave.

627
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,094
Here we're outside Ba Mai Cave.

628
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:17,849
We should be seeing a lot of Shouwu here.

629
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:20,252
Isn't Shouwu precious?

630
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:22,576
No precious things will grow all over here.

631
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:28,450
Are you Shouwu? Are you?

632
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:31,698
Actually we're looking for the spirit of Wu
Dang Mt.

633
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:35,175
Rumor has it that it attaches to the roots of
Shouwu.

634
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:37,570
Like human vessels connecting with the whole
Wu Dang Mt.

635
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:39,614
More amazingly...

636
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:42,130
it can communicate with us after it takes
human shape.

637
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:46,018
Don't you think

638
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:48,337
it was too easy to get all of this?

639
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,572
Plus, your map and mine are basically the
same.

640
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:54,299
You have doubts about the map?

641
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:57,418
Maybe I'm too paranoid.

642
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:00,170
I've lost my faith in men and things.

643
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:03,373
At least you believe in Tiandan.

644
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:05,689
I believed in science

645
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:08,569
not anything that can't be proved by science.

646
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:10,490
But later I realized

647
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:12,452
there're things that can't be explained by
science.

648
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:16,495
Lots of diseases can't be fixed by science
either.

649
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:20,818
I really have no clue

650
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:22,695
how to find the spirit of Shouwu.

651
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,613
You said it can communicate with us.

652
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:30,977
You can try to locate it with your heart.

653
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:33,019
It's only a rumor.

654
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:34,614
Like you said,

655
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:36,931
science can't explain a lot of things.

656
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:42,409
The Big Dipper.

657
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:45,450
I remember my grandpa used to say...

658
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:48,933
when a man dies,

659
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:51,218
he'll become a star in the sky

660
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:53,378
to watch his beloved.

661
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,140
So I'd always like...

662
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:00,131
to wish upon a star.

663
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:03,490
You try it.

664
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:49,130
It shows up.

665
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:51,568
You must be sincere.

666
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:11,939
According to Compendium of Materia Medica

667
01:08:13,220 --> 01:08:15,211
Male Shouwu is red. Female one is white.

668
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:17,850
They're indeed like a couple.

669
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:35,171
Got them.

670
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:54,095
Smells nice.

671
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:57,293
You're here, Ning.

672
01:08:59,180 --> 01:08:59,896
Where's Shui?

673
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:02,488
He went to pick firewood.

674
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:17,213
Please God, let Tangning get well soon.

675
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:24,179
Or pass her illness to me, please.

676
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:54,138
Hungry? Let's go.

677
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:19,415
I'm here for my father, Prof.Tang.

678
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:21,773
Could you please call him out?

679
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:26,293
We're looking for him too. Go back to your
room. Don't come out.

680
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:43,492
He won't be back tonight.

681
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:47,778
He's fine, but he's worried about you

682
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:49,419
so he let me come.

683
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:54,097
I know. I'll take good care of myself.

684
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:59,012
Tianxin, I'm so lucky.

685
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:01,415
I'll enter the final tomorrow.

686
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:08,532
Could my dad come and watch me?

687
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:19,492
Ning, he's doing the stealing for you.

688
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:21,330
You know?

689
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:24,650
Yes.

690
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:29,537
Lots of Taoists are searching for him.

691
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:33,217
My dad's a great man.

692
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:36,810
But now

693
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:41,251
he's doing the stealing for me.

694
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:02,769
Have a rest. You've got a match tomorrow.

695
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:04,655
I'm afraid.

696
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:08,975
Do you believe in miracles?

697
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:22,530
I used to think that with faith and hopes

698
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:25,570
I could live on well.

699
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:28,775
Now I've reaIized that

700
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:33,337
they can't really change what's become.

701
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:35,530
Tianxin...

702
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:38,409
my dad...

703
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:42,329
didn't believe in miracles at all

704
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:47,372
but now he's buying it for me.

705
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:52,578
I guess you've had a hard life

706
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:55,249
just like your dad.

707
01:12:56,140 --> 01:12:57,573
He may

708
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:00,780
appear to be happy on the outside

709
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:02,611
while he's really worried inside.

710
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:04,136
Tianxin

711
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:08,808
could you do me a favor

712
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:12,294
and fulfill my one last wish?

713
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:14,698
Don't say something bad.

714
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:18,370
Sure, as long as you promise to live well.

715
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:22,930
Alright, please marry my dad.

716
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:28,178
Ever since my mom passed away

717
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:33,819
I've seldom seen smiles upon his face.

718
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:38,329
I realize that he's kind of happy with you.

719
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:44,575
I like to be free you know?

720
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:47,093
I don't think I can help you with that.

721
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:54,574
I'm afraid.

722
01:13:55,620 --> 01:14:00,011
What if I have to leave him one day?

723
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:05,898
I really don't want to leave him alone.

724
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:10,692
Stop crying.

725
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:17,578
Your dad won't be left alone.

726
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:55,010
Here you are at such a high altitude.

727
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:00,809
Let's go back down and talk.

728
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:04,613
Go back down, you serious?

729
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:08,690
Tang Yunlong and that girl have disappeared.

730
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:12,172
Are they gone with those treasures?

731
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:15,969
I don't think so since his daughter's still here.

732
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:20,020
I suggest we kill him and take one or two of his
treasures.

733
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:23,376
No, I want all 7 of them.

734
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:28,255
They're more precious than any wealth and
power in the world.

735
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:34,376
I made treasure maps and gave them out.

736
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:36,859
That's why Tang Yunlong's here.

737
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:40,972
So is the long lost Ding Feng Bead.

738
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:51,379
Shui, finally we're here in a match.

739
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:57,012
Ning, I don't want to fight you. I'll admit defeat.

740
01:15:58,500 --> 01:15:59,535
You promised me.

741
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:05,654
You're a man. You should never lie.

742
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:30,215
Stop.

743
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:06,691
Stop it.

744
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:10,337
Ning.

745
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:17,815
I wish to stay here as long as I can.

746
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:32,497
Let's carry on.

747
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:33,977
Okay.

748
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:33,780
It's just a sword made of stone.

749
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:43,860
It has an unique magnetic field

750
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:46,932
unlike anything on Earth. Apologies.

751
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:16,854
Look, this is the mark of our family.

752
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:29,820
I'll go get the lightning rod on top.

753
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:31,014
Then all we need is Ding Feng Bead.

754
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:32,296
Don't go yet.

755
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:34,695
It attracts lightning. It's dangerous.

756
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:38,457
It's made to pass voltage currents to ground.

757
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:42,060
That's why the Golden Palace has never been
struck by lightning

758
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:43,209
in the last 500 years.

759
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:47,499
You've got the Sword. You going home now?

760
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:52,691
I will, but not now.

761
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:57,454
I promised Ning that I won't go till her illness is
cured.

762
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:00,773
She knows already?

763
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:04,019
Thought I could keep her in the dark

764
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:06,171
and let her live happily.

765
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:09,660
She pretended that she didn't know

766
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:10,809
just not to make you worry.

767
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:13,815
Ning's a good girl.

768
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:27,649
Fetch me the gold needle.

769
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:30,817
Ning.

770
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:32,691
Taoist Xie.

771
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:37,138
Not an internal injury. This is a weird illness.

772
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:41,578
She's bleeding all over inside.

773
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:42,537
Taoist Xie.

774
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:44,774
You could cure my mom.

775
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:47,571
I guess you can cure her too.

776
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:52,856
It's all about fortune and fate.

777
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:55,977
Ning.

778
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:57,651
Ning.

779
01:20:59,340 --> 01:20:59,931
Ning.

780
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:02,859
- Dad.
- Ning.

781
01:21:02,980 --> 01:21:03,571
Dad's here,

782
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:06,537
Ning.

783
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:13,094
Dad, I admitted defeat.
I...

784
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:17,338
Can't you cure her with Tiandan?

785
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:18,695
What are you waiting for?

786
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:23,534
Haven't got all 7 of them. Don't know if it's
going to work.

787
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:25,930
Don't hesitate. Try it now.

788
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:32,773
Tang YunIong, you're here for your daughter.

789
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:35,217
Let's set it straight then.

790
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:37,219
I have to save my daughter first.

791
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:39,489
All the treasures should be mine.

792
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:44,412
Give them to me.
Or I'll kill your daughter.

793
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:04,369
This is what I need, right?

794
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:10,214
Bailong, this lightning rod is a holy thing.
You crazy?

795
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:18,091
I'm not.
Things are going as I planned.

796
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:23,494
This is fate. This is to reunite with the nature.

797
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:26,971
You want to the Mentor huh?
No way.

798
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:32,011
I want to be more than a Mentor.

799
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:35,413
You've got me wrong.

800
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:56,938
I've planned this for years

801
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:00,458
to want to get Ding Feng Bead.

802
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:04,017
That's the necklace from my dad.
Is that the Ding Feng Bead?

803
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:08,459
Back then your dad Tianyu and I
came to Wu Dang

804
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:12,330
to want to retrieve Xuan Tian Sword that
belongs to us.

805
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:17,373
Then he discovered my secret

806
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:20,574
of wanting to collect all 7 treasures to be a
holy spirit.

807
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:25,894
So he decided to ruin it by stealing
the Ding Feng Bead from me.

808
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:30,897
He just never thought

809
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:34,170
I had collected 6 of them already.

810
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:41,294
I made a fake treasure map

811
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:46,340
and surprisingly his daughter presented
the Ding Feng bead herself.

812
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:46,692
You...

813
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:50,252
You have to take the right course
to be a holy spirit.

814
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:53,698
Bailong, what you've done is all evil.

815
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:25,536
Ning's not making it.

816
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:27,817
Ning.

817
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:29,692
Ning.

818
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:32,416
I'm afraid.

819
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:34,977
Don't be.

820
01:24:39,620 --> 01:24:44,614
7 treasures will make me a holy spirit.

821
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:50,776
Yin and Yang are not balancing here.

822
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:56,539
A nightmare has truly come.

823
01:24:57,700 --> 01:25:01,739
No one's going to stop me now.
Tiandan's working.

824
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:08,649
I'll soon be a holy spirit.

825
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:18,975
Taoist Xie, Ning's not making it.

826
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:20,574
She needs Tiandan now.

827
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:26,700
Sleeping Kung fu will make you
see emptiness and feel free

828
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:29,650
like Bailong is feeling now.

829
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:46,138
Bailong, no one dares lie to me.

830
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:48,179
Got to get Tiandan back.

831
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:54,178
You really want to try?

832
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:17,452
A sleeping fairy will forget the time.

833
01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:20,892
Concentrate on breaths and be mindful.

834
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:28,252
Let Qi run into Xuanqiao and
breathe with the nature.

835
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:49,097
Master.

836
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:43,251
Take Tiandan and save Ning now.

837
01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:30,580
You're a secular being.
Not a match for me.

838
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:23,857
Dear.

839
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:31,931
Dad.

840
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:41,894
Ning, you okay?

841
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:46,731
Tianxin.

842
01:33:51,580 --> 01:33:56,017
Tang Yunlong, you're a strong man

843
01:33:58,020 --> 01:34:02,855
but you seem weak every time
you talk about your daughter.

844
01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:05,296
The Sword...

845
01:34:22,220 --> 01:34:27,852
I'll leave it here on Wu Dang Mt.

846
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:35,812
I'm not going home anyway.

847
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:41,809
The Sword has found its home here.

848
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:46,779
This is where my heart belongs too.

849
01:34:50,980 --> 01:34:53,130
Thank you.

850
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:54,576
Tianxin.

851
01:34:57,220 --> 01:34:58,289
Tianxin.

852
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:01,090
Tianxin.

853
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:02,969
Tianxin.

854
01:35:04,820 --> 01:35:05,809
Tianxin.

855
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:13,013
Is there a treasure map in your hands?

856
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:15,568
No, there isn't.

857
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:17,290
You're here to steal the Sword?

858
01:35:17,380 --> 01:35:19,211
It belongs to my family.

859
01:35:20,020 --> 01:35:22,693
The biggest mistake you've ever made...

860
01:35:23,580 --> 01:35:24,376
I'm kidding.

861
01:35:24,580 --> 01:35:28,289
Everyone here is a Master.
You better watch out.

862
01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:33,891
I remember my grandpa used to say...

863
01:35:35,180 --> 01:35:36,693
when a man dies,

864
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:39,133
he'll become a star in the sky

865
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:42,458
to watch his beloved.

866
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:03,289
Tianxin.
