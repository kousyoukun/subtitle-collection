1
00:01:02,058 --> 00:01:03,183
Yan!

2
00:01:03,892 --> 00:01:06,142
That's enough! Stop!

3
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:09,267
Stop it!

4
00:01:26,017 --> 00:01:31,600
MAY 2002
SIX MONTHS BEFORE YAN'S DEATH

5
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:41,433
Do you know what "messed up" means?

6
00:01:41,683 --> 00:01:46,766
The first masseuse that came in
looked exactly like Sam's dog

7
00:01:47,016 --> 00:01:49,141
so I asked for a replacement.

8
00:01:49,391 --> 00:01:52,100
The next one that came in
was even worse.

9
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,308
She looked identical to Sam.

10
00:01:54,558 --> 00:01:58,266
Can you imagine?
Even I couldn't handle that.

11
00:01:58,558 --> 00:02:02,725
She had the audacity to ask me if she
was pretty. Of course I said no.

12
00:02:02,975 --> 00:02:04,558
Then she clawed me.

13
00:02:04,808 --> 00:02:05,975
So I called you.

14
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:07,516
That's when we messed up.

15
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:11,391
You smashed the whole place up.
It'll cost me a fortune in damages.

16
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:14,808
So if a masseuse is ugly,
you're definitely screwed.

17
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:21,308
Why are you swearing at your boss?

18
00:02:22,683 --> 00:02:25,058
Nurse, it's not sore, is it?

19
00:02:26,475 --> 00:02:27,641
Yan...

20
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:31,641
I asked you to do a small job.
You don't have to be like that.

21
00:02:32,516 --> 00:02:35,558
You moan
that I don't give you anything to do.

22
00:02:35,808 --> 00:02:38,183
You don't need to work
in this business.

23
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:41,141
If you want to work,
why don't you go and be a cop?

24
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,558
Do you know why
I've only got you under my wing?

25
00:02:47,308 --> 00:02:50,266
It's because
I like that you're focused.

26
00:02:50,516 --> 00:02:52,308
It's important to be focused.

27
00:02:52,558 --> 00:02:55,058
Look at Sam. He's focused, isn't he?

28
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,725
As for what happened today...

29
00:02:57,975 --> 00:02:59,558
Don't let Sam know.

30
00:02:59,808 --> 00:03:03,766
Ever since his wife died, he hates us
going to massage parlours.

31
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,766
Why don't you let me go?

32
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:07,850
Are you done talking? Get inside.

33
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,350
Hey, don't push me, Officer.

34
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,141
That's not the way to behave.

35
00:03:12,391 --> 00:03:14,433
Even cops shouldn't be like that.

36
00:03:15,141 --> 00:03:17,391
So are you going to tell on me?

37
00:03:17,641 --> 00:03:18,600
That's enough.

38
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:23,225
That's life. Either you get me or I get you.
Are you going to tell on me?

39
00:03:23,475 --> 00:03:25,016
- Fuck off!
- Don't fight!

40
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:26,891
You're hitting your own boss?

41
00:04:55,725 --> 00:05:00,600
OCTOBER 2003
TEN MONTHS AFTER YAN'S DEATH

42
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,058
File number IO143 -

43
00:05:03,308 --> 00:05:06,766
regarding the deaths of 27149,
Officer Chan Wing Yan

44
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:11,100
and 34689, Officer Lam Gok Ping.

45
00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:15,224
Internal Affairs
have produced the following report.

46
00:05:15,474 --> 00:05:17,974
On November 26th 2002,

47
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:20,016
Senior Inspector Lau Kin Ming of IA

48
00:05:20,308 --> 00:05:23,891
contacted undercover officer,
Chan Wing Yan.

49
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:27,183
With help from Officer Chan

50
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:31,224
and from the OCTB unit
in West Kowloon,

51
00:05:31,474 --> 00:05:33,558
Lau toppled Sam's drug operation

52
00:05:33,808 --> 00:05:37,641
and cocaine
worth HK$60 million was seized.

53
00:05:37,891 --> 00:05:40,266
On November 27th 2002,

54
00:05:40,516 --> 00:05:43,474
Officer Chan met with Inspector Lau,

55
00:05:43,724 --> 00:05:45,933
on the rooftop
of the Sei Fong Centre.

56
00:05:46,224 --> 00:05:48,766
Yan supplied information
on triad moles.

57
00:05:51,141 --> 00:05:52,724
You can't get away.

58
00:05:52,974 --> 00:05:53,974
Just wait and see.

59
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:58,349
You're going to kill a cop?

60
00:06:02,641 --> 00:06:05,474
I know all about you and Sam.

61
00:06:05,724 --> 00:06:08,016
You have no choice.
Come back with me.

62
00:06:08,308 --> 00:06:09,308
Drop your gun.

63
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,683
- What do you want?
- I want to get away.

64
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:33,849
The preceding testimony was provided
by Senior Inspector Lau Kin Ming.

65
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:36,516
The committee
of two Chief Superintendents

66
00:06:37,016 --> 00:06:39,016
and the Assistant Commissioner

67
00:06:39,308 --> 00:06:41,641
unanimously believe Lau's testimony.

68
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:45,016
Inspector Lau's killing

69
00:06:45,308 --> 00:06:49,391
of Officer Lam Kok Ping
has been ruled legal.

70
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:54,933
Lam has been confirmed as a mole
sent by Sam into the police force.

71
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:57,183
Finally, it's all over.

72
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:01,724
You all believe me?

73
00:07:01,974 --> 00:07:03,433
It's all over.

74
00:07:04,474 --> 00:07:06,016
Stay in Admin for now, OK?

75
00:07:08,766 --> 00:07:09,808
Wait.

76
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:12,641
Got it.

77
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,724
Your parking space -
wait three weeks. That's it.

78
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:17,474
Bye.

79
00:07:18,391 --> 00:07:19,808
Officer Chan.

80
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:21,849
Hold on.

81
00:07:23,224 --> 00:07:26,099
Your uniform's ready.
Come and get it if you're free.

82
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:28,183
Or I can send it over to you.

83
00:07:29,141 --> 00:07:31,474
No problem! OK. Bye.

84
00:07:31,724 --> 00:07:34,183
It's a shame Lam destroyed the CCTV.

85
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:36,224
It's dragged on for so long.

86
00:07:36,474 --> 00:07:39,058
You know
our bosses go on accountability.

87
00:07:39,308 --> 00:07:42,349
Luckily, you're one of us.
It was all sorted quickly.

88
00:07:43,224 --> 00:07:45,141
You can come back to IA next month.

89
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:47,224
Are you tired?

90
00:07:47,474 --> 00:07:49,933
If you are, you should go
on holiday with Mary.

91
00:07:51,016 --> 00:07:52,099
Hello.

92
00:08:02,474 --> 00:08:03,433
OK.

93
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:08,099
I'll sign the documents tomorrow.

94
00:08:10,183 --> 00:08:11,141
OK.

95
00:08:12,308 --> 00:08:13,683
We can split it.

96
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:16,516
We can split it.

97
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:23,224
We can split anything but the baby!

98
00:08:33,224 --> 00:08:34,516
Hello, Officer Chan,

99
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:36,933
your uniform's ready.

100
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,391
If you're busy, I can send it over.

101
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:43,266
I can do it. OK, wait for me. Bye.

102
00:09:28,849 --> 00:09:30,724
Have I done something wrong?

103
00:09:34,016 --> 00:09:35,974
I feel like beating someone up today.

104
00:09:40,932 --> 00:09:43,557
What's with all the fuss,
Superintendent Yeung?

105
00:09:47,432 --> 00:09:50,349
These Taiwanese men are arms dealers.

106
00:09:51,432 --> 00:09:54,099
Their customers haven't shown up.

107
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:58,349
They seemed bored,
so I'm keeping them company.

108
00:09:58,974 --> 00:09:59,932
OK?

109
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,557
Sure.

110
00:10:04,391 --> 00:10:05,807
I work in the Security Wing.

111
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,641
I don't like to see
respectable people coming here.

112
00:10:11,516 --> 00:10:13,849
You've got lots of men here.
Help me out.

113
00:10:16,057 --> 00:10:17,432
That's difficult for me.

114
00:10:22,766 --> 00:10:24,766
Would this make it better?

115
00:10:25,016 --> 00:10:27,057
What? You want to set me up?

116
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:38,849
Is that better?

117
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:42,224
We've already written the report.

118
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:45,057
That's half a kilo.
Minimum eight to ten years.

119
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:04,224
Get two of your men
to come back with me.

120
00:11:05,557 --> 00:11:07,016
They're going to say

121
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,932
they saw them take out some drugs.

122
00:11:11,182 --> 00:11:13,849
Being good citizens,
they beat them up.

123
00:11:15,974 --> 00:11:18,807
I'll give them a Good Citizen Award.

124
00:11:19,641 --> 00:11:20,641
How about that?

125
00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:22,474
Good.

126
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,307
Arrest them.

127
00:11:26,307 --> 00:11:27,266
Be polite.

128
00:11:43,724 --> 00:11:45,932
Sir, you can't go in.

129
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:50,182
Step aside.

130
00:11:52,557 --> 00:11:53,849
Over there.

131
00:11:54,557 --> 00:11:56,266
Yeung Kam Wing,
don't go too far.

132
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:58,224
I've helped you all these years.

133
00:12:00,724 --> 00:12:01,974
Do you want me dead?

134
00:12:19,432 --> 00:12:21,890
If I go down,
you'll suffer the consequences.

135
00:12:23,057 --> 00:12:25,390
Won't you give me a chance?

136
00:12:39,765 --> 00:12:43,099
ONE MONTH LATER

137
00:13:30,849 --> 00:13:32,349
Delivery from OCTB?

138
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:39,807
I was transferred from OCTB yesterday
along with the coffee.

139
00:13:40,057 --> 00:13:41,057
Have a seat.

140
00:13:42,307 --> 00:13:43,890
I've given coffee up.

141
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,224
I need sleeping pills
to get to sleep these days.

142
00:13:48,224 --> 00:13:49,890
I can't sleep if I drink coffee.

143
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:58,349
Life is so unpredictable. I used
to really hate Internal Affairs.

144
00:13:59,057 --> 00:14:01,015
And now, I've been transferred here.

145
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,474
You don't seem to be very happy.
I can transfer you elsewhere.

146
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,307
Are you kidding?

147
00:14:11,557 --> 00:14:13,349
I moved here because of you.

148
00:14:14,557 --> 00:14:16,099
The files are on your desk.

149
00:14:17,099 --> 00:14:18,307
The first file...

150
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:22,057
This sergeant killed himself
in front of his ex-boss, Yeung.

151
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:26,140
Internal Affairs
is working on a few big cases.

152
00:14:27,557 --> 00:14:30,474
You know Security are very political.

153
00:14:31,182 --> 00:14:33,015
Everything is classified there.

154
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:36,432
They won't answer
any questions you ask.

155
00:14:36,682 --> 00:14:39,432
We found a letter
on Sergeant Chun's desk.

156
00:14:39,682 --> 00:14:41,515
There was a tape inside.

157
00:14:41,765 --> 00:14:44,349
It was a conversation
between him and Sam.

158
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:46,890
It turns out he was Sam's mole too.

159
00:14:47,599 --> 00:14:51,557
Besides him, several officers have
also committed suicide or vanished.

160
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,807
They were all Sam's moles.

161
00:14:54,057 --> 00:14:55,890
The bosses say, after Sam's death,

162
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,140
one of the moles is killing
the others to keep his cover.

163
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,474
Leung has ordered us
to find out who he is.

164
00:15:02,724 --> 00:15:04,224
Do you know what happened?

165
00:15:05,182 --> 00:15:08,765
A package was sent to Leung.
Guess what it contained.

166
00:15:11,765 --> 00:15:13,765
It had tapes of us
giving tips to Sam.

167
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:17,807
Luckily,
Sergeant Chun was one of us.

168
00:15:18,057 --> 00:15:21,182
- How many more of us are there?
- Five, including you.

169
00:15:28,974 --> 00:15:31,140
Ronald, this is Inspector Lau.

170
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,765
I've left something at Admin.

171
00:15:39,682 --> 00:15:41,224
Hello?

172
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:44,640
I've found out something on Chun.

173
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,640
He was in the Police Bowling Team.

174
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:47,848
Wait.

175
00:15:48,098 --> 00:15:50,473
- That's what you asked for.
- Good.

176
00:15:50,723 --> 00:15:51,682
Thanks.

177
00:15:52,765 --> 00:15:53,723
Go on.

178
00:15:53,973 --> 00:15:55,890
He practised at the Lam Wah club.

179
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,473
He rented his flat
from Gam Dok Investments,

180
00:15:58,723 --> 00:16:00,473
which owns three big properties.

181
00:16:00,723 --> 00:16:02,807
The owner is Shen, a Mainlander.

182
00:16:03,057 --> 00:16:05,348
I'll e-mail you
the information later.

183
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:07,557
No, send it to me now.

184
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,640
29TH FLOOR, DRAGON VIEW
GARDEN, BROADCAST DRIVE

185
00:16:22,723 --> 00:16:25,848
Inspector Lau, I'm Yeung Kam Wing
from Security Wing.

186
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,848
I applied for a parking space.

187
00:16:28,098 --> 00:16:29,057
Let me check.

188
00:16:29,307 --> 00:16:30,682
I've waited a whole month.

189
00:16:30,932 --> 00:16:33,932
I don't want to bother you,
but will it take much longer?

190
00:16:34,223 --> 00:16:36,807
Sorry, but I've moved back to IA.

191
00:16:39,015 --> 00:16:42,557
I know,
but Admin asked me to contact you.

192
00:16:43,723 --> 00:16:46,682
Your application's
been approved for a month.

193
00:16:46,932 --> 00:16:49,682
Here. Your parking space is B3A6.

194
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,098
We haven't been able
to reach you for a week.

195
00:16:53,348 --> 00:16:55,015
I've been off for a month.

196
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:57,265
You know IA is investigating me.

197
00:16:57,515 --> 00:17:00,390
- I know.
- Are you investigating Admin today?

198
00:17:01,557 --> 00:17:03,348
No, I'm just picking up a uniform.

199
00:17:04,765 --> 00:17:07,223
That's a sergeant's uniform,
Inspector.

200
00:17:11,932 --> 00:17:14,598
The man who killed himself
in front of you wore it.

201
00:17:14,848 --> 00:17:16,807
I'm taking it back for investigation.

202
00:17:18,182 --> 00:17:19,723
Isn't the case closed now?

203
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:22,515
Yes, or you wouldn't be back
from your break.

204
00:17:22,765 --> 00:17:24,265
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

205
00:17:24,515 --> 00:17:25,723
B3A6.

206
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,348
Have we met before?

207
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:37,973
No.

208
00:17:39,515 --> 00:17:42,348
Do you know someone called Shen?

209
00:17:43,848 --> 00:17:44,973
No.

210
00:17:45,223 --> 00:17:47,640
Mind your own business.

211
00:17:50,223 --> 00:17:53,932
We found these photos
inside Chun's bowling locker.

212
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,057
That's Shen in the photo.

213
00:17:57,973 --> 00:18:00,223
He used to be Sam's business partner.

214
00:18:00,473 --> 00:18:03,848
The man facing him
is Security Wing's Yeung.

215
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,390
He's connected
to the sergeant's death.

216
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,223
I think Yeung could be the mole.

217
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:20,848
Hello?

218
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,598
See you later.

219
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:54,890
You're a good person. You come
and see him the moment you get back.

220
00:19:58,556 --> 00:19:59,681
You're a good man.

221
00:20:01,348 --> 00:20:05,140
If it wasn't for you,
he wouldn't be buried as a cop.

222
00:20:08,931 --> 00:20:10,306
It was my duty.

223
00:20:13,098 --> 00:20:14,765
I don't know why I helped him.

224
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,765
I only knew him
for about five months.

225
00:20:19,015 --> 00:20:20,473
I've only seen him 21 times.

226
00:20:20,723 --> 00:20:23,348
HE DIED BRAVELY
HIS NOBLE SPIRIT IS ETERNAL

227
00:20:25,056 --> 00:20:26,515
He was a good cop.

228
00:20:28,306 --> 00:20:30,056
Anyone would have helped him.

229
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:41,890
I'll give you a lift.

230
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:05,431
Hello.

231
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,223
I'm back.

232
00:21:09,181 --> 00:21:10,390
Let's get started.

233
00:21:19,473 --> 00:21:21,973
There are no triads in China.

234
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:29,223
What China needs is wealth.

235
00:21:30,306 --> 00:21:33,806
Triads are all about life and death.
Business is all about money.

236
00:21:34,056 --> 00:21:36,515
Today, we're here to talk business.

237
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:42,140
- But I'm a real triad.
- No.

238
00:21:42,931 --> 00:21:46,140
To me, you're the best businessman.

239
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:48,515
My brother said so too.

240
00:21:49,806 --> 00:21:52,265
We have HK$100 million to spend.

241
00:21:52,515 --> 00:21:54,473
We want to invest in your business.

242
00:21:55,931 --> 00:21:58,140
We'll ask no questions.

243
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,015
It's one country, two systems.

244
00:22:01,015 --> 00:22:05,640
As long as money breeds money,
we'll let you have full control.

245
00:22:06,598 --> 00:22:07,973
You still believe in that?

246
00:22:11,348 --> 00:22:14,515
You won't be able
to refuse our Mainland ties.

247
00:22:14,765 --> 00:22:18,306
You think a Hong Kong triad can
outlive a Mainland businessman?

248
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:24,181
Without my brother's connections,
your business in China won't last.

249
00:22:30,973 --> 00:22:34,473
Sam, you're a Buddhist, right?

250
00:22:36,265 --> 00:22:37,931
Amitabha.

251
00:22:44,348 --> 00:22:46,848
Is the feng shui good here?

252
00:22:47,098 --> 00:22:49,098
The best in Hong Kong.

253
00:22:50,598 --> 00:22:53,473
I want to get
a longevity tablet here.

254
00:22:55,014 --> 00:22:56,181
For whom?

255
00:22:59,223 --> 00:23:00,348
For my wife.

256
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:05,181
She died six months ago.

257
00:23:08,139 --> 00:23:10,889
And also one for myself.

258
00:23:14,848 --> 00:23:16,931
That's a small matter,
I'll handle it.

259
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:19,306
- A small matter?
- Yes.

260
00:23:20,514 --> 00:23:23,473
If it's such a small matter,
let my men deal with it.

261
00:23:24,514 --> 00:23:26,306
We'll see how they handle it.

262
00:23:28,639 --> 00:23:29,681
Goodbye.

263
00:23:30,431 --> 00:23:31,514
Bye.

264
00:23:43,056 --> 00:23:44,348
Keung.

265
00:23:45,681 --> 00:23:47,473
You'll deal with his men.

266
00:23:48,431 --> 00:23:49,889
Are you kidding, Sam?

267
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:53,306
I'm an idiot.
Do you want it messed up?

268
00:24:01,181 --> 00:24:03,223
What does that laugh mean?

269
00:24:37,723 --> 00:24:39,848
Excuse me. Thank you.

270
00:24:49,806 --> 00:24:50,806
That's a lot.

271
00:24:51,598 --> 00:24:53,014
Are you jealous?

272
00:24:53,264 --> 00:24:55,306
Is it legit? Be careful.

273
00:24:56,473 --> 00:24:58,431
Don't worry, boss.

274
00:24:58,681 --> 00:25:00,806
You know how much money I have.

275
00:25:01,556 --> 00:25:04,639
Just ask if you want a loan.
You don't need to threaten me.

276
00:25:06,889 --> 00:25:09,764
- What's this?
- It's for your baby daughter.

277
00:25:11,389 --> 00:25:13,848
You're a dad now.
You should go home more.

278
00:25:14,098 --> 00:25:15,181
Don't work so hard.

279
00:25:17,806 --> 00:25:20,681
You've lost weight recently.

280
00:25:20,973 --> 00:25:22,973
None of your business. But thanks.

281
00:25:25,889 --> 00:25:27,181
Who are these two?

282
00:25:27,973 --> 00:25:29,723
I only know they're Mainlanders.

283
00:25:29,973 --> 00:25:31,014
Anything else?

284
00:25:37,389 --> 00:25:40,806
Shen was born in Taiyuan, Shanxi.
He's been in the army.

285
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:44,931
He dealt in antiques. He started
from scratch, now he's loaded.

286
00:25:45,223 --> 00:25:46,806
He came to Hong Kong a year ago.

287
00:25:47,056 --> 00:25:50,806
His brother Liang joined him
and does all the dirty work.

288
00:25:51,056 --> 00:25:53,264
Sam wants to expand to the Mainland.

289
00:25:53,556 --> 00:25:56,306
- What did he want you to talk about?
- Cooperation.

290
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,848
- Liang.
- Yan.

291
00:25:59,098 --> 00:26:00,556
Sit down.

292
00:26:00,806 --> 00:26:01,973
Are you by yourself?

293
00:26:02,223 --> 00:26:03,639
You too, Liang?

294
00:26:06,306 --> 00:26:08,848
We have lots of nightclubs in China.

295
00:26:09,556 --> 00:26:12,514
They're all protected
by local gang bosses.

296
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,639
Influential people.

297
00:26:18,806 --> 00:26:22,597
Your goods can move around
our network easily.

298
00:26:24,556 --> 00:26:27,181
We have businesses in 11 cities.

299
00:26:31,472 --> 00:26:32,431
Excuse me.

300
00:26:35,181 --> 00:26:38,264
- Hello?
- Well, how's the talk so far?

301
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:39,514
Not bad.

302
00:26:41,431 --> 00:26:43,222
See the ashtray in front of you?

303
00:26:44,514 --> 00:26:47,097
Pick it up and smash him with it.

304
00:26:54,764 --> 00:26:55,806
Hit him!

305
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:58,514
Hit him in the head!

306
00:27:53,389 --> 00:27:54,972
I'm screwed.

307
00:27:55,222 --> 00:27:57,431
- What is it?
- Mary's pregnant.

308
00:27:58,681 --> 00:28:01,306
- Congratulations.
- But we're not married yet.

309
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:03,722
- Get married then.
- Is that necessary?

310
00:28:03,972 --> 00:28:06,889
- Or she can have an abortion.
- We're already engaged.

311
00:28:07,139 --> 00:28:08,431
Hello?

312
00:28:08,681 --> 00:28:09,889
Got it.

313
00:28:10,139 --> 00:28:11,764
- We can go.
- Let's go.

314
00:28:16,472 --> 00:28:18,389
Long time no see, Wong.

315
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:21,722
But I saw you last week
with a girl in China.

316
00:28:21,972 --> 00:28:23,597
You don't have to shout.

317
00:28:23,847 --> 00:28:26,181
Security people are full of secrets.

318
00:28:29,264 --> 00:28:30,306
Stop for a minute.

319
00:28:47,056 --> 00:28:48,847
Hey, what's going on?

320
00:28:49,139 --> 00:28:50,972
What are you doing here?

321
00:28:56,806 --> 00:28:59,847
Hey! What's going on?
What are you doing?

322
00:29:07,639 --> 00:29:08,806
Sorry, sir.

323
00:29:09,056 --> 00:29:12,972
We were asked to take some mugshots.
I don't know what's going on either.

324
00:29:13,806 --> 00:29:15,722
I asked CIB to open a file

325
00:29:16,764 --> 00:29:18,972
and take a picture of everyone.

326
00:29:19,972 --> 00:29:20,931
Is that alright?

327
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:27,056
Officers, are you done?

328
00:29:28,931 --> 00:29:30,097
Everybody's here.

329
00:29:37,306 --> 00:29:39,681
We were investigating Mr Shen...

330
00:29:41,139 --> 00:29:44,305
...but we ended up
being led to Sam by chance.

331
00:29:45,097 --> 00:29:46,555
We even arrested Sam's men.

332
00:29:47,472 --> 00:29:49,639
I'll let CIB handle the triads.

333
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:51,597
Sam, long time no see. Are you OK?

334
00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:56,597
- What brings you here?
- I'm accompanying some friends.

335
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,805
You Hong Kong Police
are so inefficient.

336
00:30:03,097 --> 00:30:04,555
I'll speed it up then.

337
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:07,764
He beat you up.

338
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,555
Do you want to press charges?

339
00:30:09,847 --> 00:30:11,930
If not, then please sign here.

340
00:30:44,222 --> 00:30:46,055
I hit you. Want to press charges?

341
00:30:46,347 --> 00:30:47,514
You're crazy.

342
00:30:51,097 --> 00:30:53,222
Keung, let's go.

343
00:30:54,139 --> 00:30:55,097
Wait.

344
00:31:09,722 --> 00:31:11,347
Do you recognise me?

345
00:31:15,264 --> 00:31:18,014
I recognise you. Be careful.

346
00:31:23,097 --> 00:31:24,722
Wong.

347
00:31:25,555 --> 00:31:27,972
It's up to you what you do with them.

348
00:31:32,889 --> 00:31:34,555
It's OK. We all know each other.

349
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:50,264
CIB colleagues, you can go now.

350
00:31:50,514 --> 00:31:52,097
Thanks, Ming. Thank you.

351
00:31:52,347 --> 00:31:53,805
Just doing my job.

352
00:31:54,055 --> 00:31:55,472
Let's go.

353
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:01,639
What's your game?

354
00:32:03,347 --> 00:32:06,055
You think I'm playing?
It's life and death.

355
00:32:06,347 --> 00:32:07,472
I'm glad you know that.

356
00:32:25,597 --> 00:32:26,930
Hurry up and thank me.

357
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,514
Thank you for what?

358
00:32:28,764 --> 00:32:31,347
- Look what you're doing.
- Eating.

359
00:32:31,597 --> 00:32:33,305
You're eating shark fin.

360
00:32:33,555 --> 00:32:35,264
Shark fin, think about it.

361
00:32:35,514 --> 00:32:39,389
When Sam took me to Thailand,
I had shark fin and then I moved up.

362
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,764
You're having shark fin
so you're moving up.

363
00:32:43,014 --> 00:32:46,139
Sam's mean,
but he still bought you shark fin.

364
00:32:46,389 --> 00:32:47,680
Just think about it.

365
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,639
Take him.

366
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:10,097
Let go of him.

367
00:33:15,138 --> 00:33:16,222
Sam,

368
00:33:17,305 --> 00:33:19,513
are you letting them
take Yan to China?

369
00:33:20,972 --> 00:33:22,638
Ask him why he smashed his head.

370
00:33:28,138 --> 00:33:29,888
He smashed his head?

371
00:33:30,138 --> 00:33:31,097
That's nothing.

372
00:33:31,347 --> 00:33:34,013
In this job,
either you get them or they get you.

373
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,888
Yan smashed his head, right?
How about this?

374
00:33:42,097 --> 00:33:43,680
Is that alright now?

375
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:53,888
Liang.

376
00:33:59,013 --> 00:34:01,638
Are you here to make a scene...

377
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:05,180
...or are you here for business?

378
00:34:11,305 --> 00:34:12,263
Go.

379
00:34:13,305 --> 00:34:14,263
Go!

380
00:34:21,222 --> 00:34:22,513
We're even now.

381
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:24,972
Let's talk business.

382
00:34:28,472 --> 00:34:30,430
I heard
you have a big arms business.

383
00:34:30,722 --> 00:34:32,847
If you let me chip in...

384
00:34:35,555 --> 00:34:38,555
...the blood they have spilt
will not be in vain.

385
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,847
Sam.

386
00:35:02,305 --> 00:35:03,347
So?

387
00:35:04,763 --> 00:35:06,097
You're not happy with me?

388
00:35:07,513 --> 00:35:08,472
No.

389
00:35:12,805 --> 00:35:14,305
Have you ever met someone...

390
00:35:15,763 --> 00:35:17,180
...who seems nice...

391
00:35:18,972 --> 00:35:20,847
...but who might kill you at any time?

392
00:35:25,055 --> 00:35:26,472
I've met someone like that.

393
00:35:31,097 --> 00:35:32,513
What do you think, Sam?

394
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,555
I'm wondering...

395
00:35:39,388 --> 00:35:40,680
...why he didn't kill you.

396
00:35:45,222 --> 00:35:48,097
You'll look after
the Mainland business from now on.

397
00:35:51,138 --> 00:35:52,763
Take this for now.

398
00:36:09,972 --> 00:36:11,347
Shen's not what he seems.

399
00:36:11,597 --> 00:36:13,305
Security is investigating him.

400
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:16,555
He could be smuggling arms.

401
00:36:16,805 --> 00:36:18,805
Sam stopped all his deals in China.

402
00:36:19,055 --> 00:36:21,013
They're going to work together soon.

403
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:22,847
That's a big deal.

404
00:36:25,055 --> 00:36:26,472
What should I do?

405
00:36:27,222 --> 00:36:28,513
Have you seen the shrink?

406
00:36:29,347 --> 00:36:31,347
Why should I see a shrink?

407
00:36:31,597 --> 00:36:34,930
I persuaded the Department
of Justice not to send you to prison.

408
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:39,722
It's fine if you don't want to go.
See you in prison. Bye.

409
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:43,388
Hello? Hello? What's the address?

410
00:36:45,055 --> 00:36:46,013
Bye.

411
00:36:47,721 --> 00:36:49,305
I'm meeting with Dr Lee.

412
00:36:49,555 --> 00:36:50,513
This way.

413
00:38:04,055 --> 00:38:06,888
Are you planning
to spend the night here?

414
00:38:11,805 --> 00:38:13,680
I can't fall asleep in my office.

415
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,221
Unlike him.

416
00:38:33,638 --> 00:38:35,263
He said...

417
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:38,638
...ever since he became a mole...

418
00:38:42,471 --> 00:38:44,763
...he could only fall asleep here.

419
00:38:57,846 --> 00:38:59,013
I still remember...

420
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:02,930
That night...

421
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:08,930
He said everything
would be OK after tomorrow.

422
00:39:13,638 --> 00:39:15,471
And then he died.

423
00:39:36,221 --> 00:39:37,430
You're a doctor.

424
00:39:45,596 --> 00:39:48,555
Do you still have his file?

425
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,513
He may be dead,
but he's still a patient.

426
00:40:00,305 --> 00:40:01,471
- Let's go.
- OK.

427
00:40:14,013 --> 00:40:17,096
THREE HOURS LATER

428
00:41:10,638 --> 00:41:14,554
We found a letter on Sergeant Chun's
desk. There was a tape inside.

429
00:41:14,804 --> 00:41:17,804
It was a conversation
between him and Sam.

430
00:41:18,471 --> 00:41:20,263
The bosses say, after Sam's death,

431
00:41:20,554 --> 00:41:23,471
one of the moles is killing
the others to keep his cover.

432
00:41:24,513 --> 00:41:26,554
He's connected to Chun's death.

433
00:41:27,429 --> 00:41:29,596
I think Yeung could be the mole.

434
00:43:45,929 --> 00:43:48,262
Do you understand what I said?

435
00:43:48,512 --> 00:43:49,471
Sorry.

436
00:43:50,637 --> 00:43:54,304
I won't sign it
if she doesn't come and meet me.

437
00:43:54,554 --> 00:43:55,554
Do you understand?

438
00:43:56,596 --> 00:43:57,554
OK.

439
00:44:14,429 --> 00:44:16,471
My wife and I
may be getting divorced.

440
00:44:18,096 --> 00:44:19,179
Did I scare you?

441
00:44:20,262 --> 00:44:21,221
Sorry.

442
00:44:22,054 --> 00:44:23,012
Be careful.

443
00:44:23,304 --> 00:44:24,387
Of what?

444
00:44:25,971 --> 00:44:28,929
Your car's next to mine.
I drive badly.

445
00:44:29,179 --> 00:44:31,721
If I scratch your car,
come and find me.

446
00:44:36,512 --> 00:44:38,971
I'm a good driver.
You don't have to worry.

447
00:45:27,596 --> 00:45:30,762
The Taiwanese we arrested
will be discharged next week.

448
00:45:31,012 --> 00:45:33,179
The Taiwan authorities
have no comment.

449
00:45:33,429 --> 00:45:36,262
The Mainland police
will come for extradition.

450
00:45:36,512 --> 00:45:38,221
I know their boss well.

451
00:45:38,471 --> 00:45:40,887
Stick to the plan and be careful.

452
00:45:41,137 --> 00:45:42,596
When they arrive,

453
00:45:42,846 --> 00:45:46,429
make them feel welcome and take
them out for dinner and shopping.

454
00:45:47,096 --> 00:45:48,971
How about a nightclub?

455
00:45:49,221 --> 00:45:50,596
Macau is better.

456
00:45:50,846 --> 00:45:52,762
You're not afraid of reporters?

457
00:45:53,012 --> 00:45:55,512
We can cover their heads with bags.

458
00:45:55,762 --> 00:45:58,596
- OK, you bring the bags.
- What are you like?

459
00:45:59,721 --> 00:46:01,179
Superintendent Yeung.

460
00:46:01,429 --> 00:46:04,012
It's Sergeant Chun's memorial
next week.

461
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:06,387
We're all chipping in for a service.

462
00:46:23,429 --> 00:46:25,179
- Do it properly.
- Yes, sir.

463
00:46:25,429 --> 00:46:28,762
Back to the Mainland police.
Talk to the Macau guys tomorrow.

464
00:46:29,012 --> 00:46:32,971
Let them plan the evening.
I'll talk to them about security.

465
00:46:33,637 --> 00:46:37,012
If we don't plan, it'll be a mess.
Then we won't have a good time.

466
00:51:52,678 --> 00:51:54,595
Anything to add to your testimony?

467
00:51:56,345 --> 00:51:57,303
No.

468
00:51:58,303 --> 00:52:00,803
Call us any time
if you need anything.

469
00:52:01,387 --> 00:52:02,470
Thank you.

470
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:05,387
- Are you done?
- Yes.

471
00:52:08,012 --> 00:52:10,470
- Is it OK if I touch things?
- Yes.

472
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,845
OK, thank you.

473
00:52:16,262 --> 00:52:18,220
Is everything OK?

474
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,095
It was like this when I came in.

475
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:26,012
They stole some cash and watches.

476
00:52:27,345 --> 00:52:28,845
And the computer's gone.

477
00:52:31,928 --> 00:52:35,762
It's better this way.
I can start from scratch.

478
00:52:39,553 --> 00:52:41,428
But the computer's useless to them.

479
00:52:44,095 --> 00:52:45,928
I locked it with my password.

480
00:52:46,678 --> 00:52:49,387
They won't know
it's my license plate number.

481
00:52:58,887 --> 00:53:01,345
Your eyes are all red.

482
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,678
You haven't slept?

483
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:08,095
I've been
following several cases for days.

484
00:53:09,512 --> 00:53:10,887
You should get some sleep.

485
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:19,262
OK.
Everything will be OK after tomorrow.

486
00:53:21,012 --> 00:53:23,220
I'm off.
Call me if you need anything.

487
00:54:11,012 --> 00:54:11,970
Mr Chan.

488
00:54:13,345 --> 00:54:18,428
AUGUST 16TH 2002
THE FIRST SESSION

489
00:54:21,011 --> 00:54:23,470
Mr Chan, I'm Dr Lee.

490
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:28,553
I'm obligated to tell you that you've
been ordered to undergo treatment.

491
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:32,428
You should complete the treatment
in six months.

492
00:54:33,761 --> 00:54:36,761
After that,
I'll submit a report to the Court.

493
00:54:38,303 --> 00:54:41,178
The Court will use that
to decide if you should go to prison.

494
00:54:44,845 --> 00:54:45,803
Prison?

495
00:54:47,136 --> 00:54:48,636
Isn't the treatment enough?

496
00:54:49,345 --> 00:54:52,345
You must follow
doctor's orders during this time

497
00:54:52,595 --> 00:54:55,636
or the Court can revoke the sentence

498
00:54:55,886 --> 00:54:58,511
and detain you for handling.

499
00:54:58,761 --> 00:54:59,803
I see.

500
00:55:03,178 --> 00:55:04,636
Excuse me.

501
00:55:09,386 --> 00:55:11,095
Wong, you git.

502
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,011
Dr Lee, you don't need
to call the police. Just call me.

503
00:55:18,261 --> 00:55:19,636
You have my mobile number.

504
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:26,970
I'll become a wanted criminal.

505
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:30,553
THE SECOND SESSION

506
00:55:36,595 --> 00:55:38,928
Mr Chan, I'm Dr Lee.

507
00:55:39,178 --> 00:55:43,470
I'm obligated to tell you that you've
been ordered to undergo treatment.

508
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,553
You should complete the treatment
in six months.

509
00:55:46,803 --> 00:55:48,803
You'll submit a report to the Court.

510
00:55:49,053 --> 00:55:52,928
They'll use this report and they
might put me in prison. I get it.

511
00:55:53,928 --> 00:55:55,595
Please sign here then.

512
00:55:59,595 --> 00:56:01,803
We think you have a violent streak

513
00:56:02,095 --> 00:56:04,595
so we'll use hypnotism
for your treatment.

514
00:56:04,886 --> 00:56:05,636
Hypnotism?

515
00:56:07,636 --> 00:56:08,678
You signed the form.

516
00:56:09,386 --> 00:56:10,345
Hypnotism?

517
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:15,053
You can refuse it

518
00:56:15,303 --> 00:56:17,095
but the Court can revoke it.

519
00:56:17,386 --> 00:56:18,886
And lock me up?

520
00:56:25,011 --> 00:56:26,178
Alright, then.

521
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:28,928
Hypnotize me.

522
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:31,178
Hypnotize me now.

523
00:56:33,178 --> 00:56:34,303
Let's begin.

524
00:56:35,678 --> 00:56:37,511
Please introduce yourself.

525
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:39,345
Talk about your family.

526
00:56:43,886 --> 00:56:44,845
Mr Chan?

527
00:56:46,011 --> 00:56:46,970
Mr Chan.

528
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:50,136
Can you cooperate?

529
00:56:50,803 --> 00:56:53,886
I was practising just in case
you couldn't hypnotize me.

530
00:56:54,136 --> 00:56:56,053
I can hypnotize myself for you.

531
00:56:57,261 --> 00:56:59,261
My will is really strong, you know.

532
00:56:59,511 --> 00:57:01,136
It's not easy to hypnotize me.

533
00:57:03,303 --> 00:57:04,595
I haven't started yet.

534
00:57:09,261 --> 00:57:10,386
Not yet.

535
00:57:20,011 --> 00:57:21,303
You want to know my story?

536
00:57:23,636 --> 00:57:25,220
My surname isn't really Chan.

537
00:57:26,303 --> 00:57:27,803
I was an illegitimate child.

538
00:57:29,845 --> 00:57:31,220
My dad sold drugs.

539
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:34,928
I've been working since I was little.

540
00:57:36,761 --> 00:57:38,470
I earned HK$200,000 a month.

541
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,220
I brought a Porsche at 17.

542
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:42,928
I didn't have a license
so I hired two drivers.

543
00:57:43,219 --> 00:57:46,344
This psychiatry thing is pointless.

544
00:57:48,969 --> 00:57:50,844
It's either the shrink or prison.

545
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,386
She wants to hypnotize me.

546
00:57:55,636 --> 00:57:58,928
If I end up revealing everything,
don't blame me.

547
00:57:59,636 --> 00:58:03,303
It's not that easy. She can't do it
if you don't concentrate.

548
00:58:04,803 --> 00:58:06,428
It's tough not to concentrate.

549
00:58:07,594 --> 00:58:08,844
Dr Lee is a nice...

550
00:58:13,761 --> 00:58:14,844
...person.

551
00:58:15,594 --> 00:58:16,969
You wouldn't understand.

552
00:58:27,844 --> 00:58:29,094
THE THIRD SESSION

553
00:58:29,344 --> 00:58:32,928
You're looking at the sky.
There are lots of clouds.

554
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,969
You're in the water.

555
00:58:36,511 --> 00:58:38,594
Your body
is wrapped by the warm water.

556
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:43,511
You feel a sense of weightlessness.

557
00:58:44,844 --> 00:58:46,636
You're floating on the water.

558
00:58:49,219 --> 00:58:50,553
Slowly open your eyes.

559
00:58:52,219 --> 00:58:53,553
The sky is close to you.

560
00:58:56,719 --> 00:58:57,678
Then...

561
00:59:04,344 --> 00:59:05,803
What are you doing?

562
00:59:08,261 --> 00:59:09,386
I'm hungry.

563
00:59:10,386 --> 00:59:12,219
My stomach will hurt if I don't eat.

564
00:59:17,886 --> 00:59:19,844
- Are you finished?
- Yes.

565
00:59:20,094 --> 00:59:21,219
Let's start.

566
00:59:26,261 --> 00:59:27,803
Can you see the sea?

567
00:59:30,844 --> 00:59:34,136
You're in the water.
The water is really warm.

568
00:59:35,053 --> 00:59:37,094
It has wrapped round your whole body.

569
00:59:38,386 --> 00:59:41,428
Next, you feel
a sense of weightlessness.

570
00:59:51,636 --> 00:59:53,594
You have a lot of tricks.

571
00:59:55,094 --> 00:59:56,178
Not really.

572
00:59:56,428 --> 00:59:59,344
I'm afraid of oversleeping
during the hypnosis.

573
00:59:59,594 --> 01:00:01,553
It's best to set an alarm.

574
01:00:08,136 --> 01:00:09,844
It's not hard to remember.

575
01:00:10,094 --> 01:00:12,428
A Mercedes to Zhanjiang.
A Land Cruiser...

576
01:00:12,678 --> 01:00:13,969
THE FOURTH SESSION

577
01:00:14,678 --> 01:00:16,636
Write it down if you can't remember!

578
01:00:18,636 --> 01:00:22,303
The speedboats
definitely need new motors.

579
01:00:22,594 --> 01:00:24,011
Pink?

580
01:00:24,261 --> 01:00:26,011
We're smuggling, not sailing.

581
01:00:26,761 --> 01:00:29,678
My fax number is 21918125.

582
01:00:31,136 --> 01:00:32,094
No fax machine?

583
01:00:32,386 --> 01:00:34,136
Why did you ask for my fax number?

584
01:00:35,636 --> 01:00:36,594
E-mail?

585
01:00:38,261 --> 01:00:39,219
E-mail address?

586
01:00:41,761 --> 01:00:42,803
No e-mail.

587
01:00:49,094 --> 01:00:51,219
Sorry, I've been really busy.

588
01:00:52,178 --> 01:00:54,178
So are you done with your business?

589
01:00:54,428 --> 01:00:56,011
Let's talk about your family.

590
01:00:57,719 --> 01:00:59,511
You said your dad had three wives.

591
01:00:59,761 --> 01:01:01,178
You have 16 sisters.

592
01:01:01,428 --> 01:01:03,511
Let's talk about your twelfth sister.

593
01:01:11,427 --> 01:01:12,594
I haven't...

594
01:01:18,302 --> 01:01:19,469
Are you OK?

595
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:21,386
- Go away.
- What's wrong?

596
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:22,886
I haven't answered it.

597
01:01:27,761 --> 01:01:28,761
Better now?

598
01:01:35,136 --> 01:01:39,344
The report for the Court
isn't important to me.

599
01:01:42,094 --> 01:01:43,052
I'm a doctor.

600
01:01:44,136 --> 01:01:45,469
I only want to cure you.

601
01:01:47,927 --> 01:01:50,552
If you don't want that,
you can leave at any time.

602
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:04,386
I've been wanting
to tell you something.

603
01:02:08,052 --> 01:02:11,386
If you keep lying, I can't help you.

604
01:02:32,427 --> 01:02:37,969
THE... SESSION

605
01:04:03,261 --> 01:04:04,219
Dr Lee.

606
01:04:05,927 --> 01:04:08,219
Did I do anything else besides sleep?

607
01:04:10,219 --> 01:04:12,469
You don't remember what you've done?

608
01:04:15,344 --> 01:04:17,219
I do remember, but I'm not sure.

609
01:04:18,302 --> 01:04:19,969
Forget it. Bye.

610
01:04:31,136 --> 01:04:32,177
Dr Lee.

611
01:04:35,552 --> 01:04:37,552
I think you're especially nice to me.

612
01:04:38,177 --> 01:04:40,261
- Do you fancy me?
- You're delusional.

613
01:04:42,135 --> 01:04:43,177
Delusional?

614
01:04:47,635 --> 01:04:48,969
No wonder.

615
01:04:51,094 --> 01:04:52,052
Bye.

616
01:05:04,052 --> 01:05:07,427
What are you smiling about?
Did she say you'll die tomorrow?

617
01:05:08,469 --> 01:05:09,844
You wouldn't understand.

618
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,719
You think I'm delusional?

619
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:13,969
Delusional?

620
01:05:14,844 --> 01:05:15,802
You are.

621
01:05:16,510 --> 01:05:19,635
Maybe all the hypnotism
has made me delusional.

622
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,719
That's...

623
01:05:21,969 --> 01:05:24,552
- Hey, watch the road!
- So many cars.

624
01:05:25,302 --> 01:05:29,427
They find a woman to mess with your
head so you'll pour your heart out.

625
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:33,510
It's not her,
it all to do with Freud.

626
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:36,135
According to psychoanalysis,

627
01:05:36,385 --> 01:05:38,802
hypnosis can get
to your subconscious.

628
01:05:39,052 --> 01:05:42,302
From there,
it can reach your darker side.

629
01:05:43,802 --> 01:05:47,135
After reaching that side,
your traumas can be treated.

630
01:05:47,385 --> 01:05:49,094
There'll be symbolic memories.

631
01:05:49,344 --> 01:05:50,719
That's really deep.

632
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:55,469
I can't help it. It was written
in the book that Shen gave me.

633
01:05:56,427 --> 01:05:57,802
Are you friends with Shen?

634
01:05:58,052 --> 01:06:00,677
No way. He's the one clinging to me.

635
01:06:27,677 --> 01:06:28,635
Mr Shen.

636
01:06:29,594 --> 01:06:31,469
Mr Shen. Let me apologise for Yan.

637
01:06:31,719 --> 01:06:33,385
I'll apologise for him.

638
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:42,677
Have you ever heard the saying,

639
01:06:42,927 --> 01:06:46,302
"Men are changed by events,
not events by men?"

640
01:06:50,552 --> 01:06:54,219
There's no present without the past.

641
01:06:55,635 --> 01:06:56,594
Thank you.

642
01:06:56,885 --> 01:06:57,885
What?

643
01:06:58,844 --> 01:06:59,802
Good speech.

644
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:03,677
Where's Sam?

645
01:07:03,927 --> 01:07:06,219
He sent the two of us.

646
01:07:57,719 --> 01:07:58,677
Sam.

647
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:02,344
Are you reading?

648
01:08:03,177 --> 01:08:04,469
Any recommendations?

649
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:05,677
And you?

650
01:08:07,427 --> 01:08:10,010
How To Get Rich in One Day.
It's good.

651
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:11,593
I don't need the money.

652
01:08:14,427 --> 01:08:17,343
I've helped you these last few years.

653
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:20,760
You should speak first.

654
01:08:24,635 --> 01:08:27,302
You already know everything
that I know.

655
01:08:31,635 --> 01:08:33,093
Let's cut the crap.

656
01:08:34,385 --> 01:08:35,468
Will you help me?

657
01:08:37,218 --> 01:08:40,343
You help me, I help you.
We'll help each other.

658
01:08:41,135 --> 01:08:42,635
Good.

659
01:08:46,052 --> 01:08:47,427
What are you doing here?

660
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:50,260
Me? I'm here...

661
01:09:48,093 --> 01:09:49,302
He's gone.

662
01:09:56,052 --> 01:09:57,010
Who is he?

663
01:09:59,343 --> 01:10:00,302
A pimp.

664
01:10:01,927 --> 01:10:03,218
Why were you tailing him?

665
01:10:05,218 --> 01:10:07,843
I'm a pimp too.
I want to know if he stole my girls.

666
01:10:10,552 --> 01:10:12,802
Actually, I could do with some money.

667
01:10:13,802 --> 01:10:16,593
If you don't mind,
how about hiring me?

668
01:10:20,427 --> 01:10:21,760
Be serious, Dr Lee.

669
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:24,385
Be serious, pimp.

670
01:10:55,093 --> 01:10:57,177
Hello, Internal Affairs.

671
01:10:57,427 --> 01:11:00,427
Boss, I saw Yeung with Sam today.

672
01:11:01,135 --> 01:11:03,760
Yeung may be a mole.
Run a check on him.

673
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:07,718
Sam's deal with Shen
should start soon.

674
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:12,968
Hello?

675
01:11:59,843 --> 01:12:01,551
Uncle Chan, you're here so late.

676
01:12:01,801 --> 01:12:03,593
I'm changing the water.

677
01:12:04,843 --> 01:12:06,801
You're quite something, Uncle Chan.

678
01:12:07,093 --> 01:12:09,301
You know exactly
when we run out of water.

679
01:12:09,551 --> 01:12:12,426
Don't just talk, give me a hand.

680
01:12:13,926 --> 01:12:15,343
Damon, help him.

681
01:12:18,468 --> 01:12:20,801
Let me, Uncle Chan. Let me.

682
01:12:49,885 --> 01:12:50,843
Hello?

683
01:12:51,093 --> 01:12:52,718
Why didn't you speakjust then?

684
01:12:54,010 --> 01:12:55,426
Yan sent me a tape.

685
01:12:59,176 --> 01:13:01,385
Chan Wing Yan sent you a tape?

686
01:13:07,635 --> 01:13:08,676
Wait for me.

687
01:13:12,718 --> 01:13:14,968
Hey! What's the matter with you?

688
01:13:15,218 --> 01:13:16,760
- I'm busy.
- Wait.

689
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:18,093
What is it?

690
01:13:19,051 --> 01:13:20,968
You've been back for two days.

691
01:13:21,218 --> 01:13:23,885
You haven't seen anybody else but me.

692
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:26,968
Am I supposed to greet everyone?

693
01:13:28,426 --> 01:13:29,385
Hey!

694
01:13:39,801 --> 01:13:40,801
Did I scare you?

695
01:13:41,968 --> 01:13:42,926
Sorry.

696
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:45,301
Sorry.

697
01:13:53,968 --> 01:13:56,968
I don't know why you've
locked yourself up for two days.

698
01:13:57,218 --> 01:14:00,510
Whatever it is,
don't take everything on yourself.

699
01:14:07,135 --> 01:14:09,135
Everything will be OK after tomorrow.

700
01:14:13,635 --> 01:14:14,593
Lau.

701
01:14:21,551 --> 01:14:22,801
The door is over there.

702
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:56,343
PO BOX 27149
CHAN WING YIN

703
01:14:57,968 --> 01:14:59,093
Let's give it to OCTB.

704
01:15:09,801 --> 01:15:11,176
Have you listened to it?

705
01:15:12,843 --> 01:15:13,801
No.

706
01:15:40,468 --> 01:15:42,759
Sam and Shen's transaction
is in two days.

707
01:15:43,009 --> 01:15:44,884
There'll be lots of arms and coke.

708
01:15:45,134 --> 01:15:47,134
I'll contact you before it starts.

709
01:15:47,384 --> 01:15:49,593
So Sam doesn't
completely trust you yet.

710
01:15:51,551 --> 01:15:52,801
Beware of Yeung.

711
01:15:53,551 --> 01:15:54,509
I will.

712
01:15:55,134 --> 01:15:56,593
Can you arrest him?

713
01:15:57,343 --> 01:15:58,593
You saw them together.

714
01:15:58,843 --> 01:16:01,009
That's not enough.
How can I arrest him?

715
01:16:02,301 --> 01:16:04,134
Boss, I'm risking my life for you.

716
01:16:04,384 --> 01:16:05,801
Don't tell me that.

717
01:16:06,551 --> 01:16:08,634
I'll take care of Yeung.

718
01:16:14,384 --> 01:16:15,343
You?

719
01:16:16,759 --> 01:16:18,634
Don't worry. Lau's a great help.

720
01:16:18,926 --> 01:16:22,051
What are you saying?
It's his fault that you die.

721
01:16:23,926 --> 01:16:25,301
It was an accident.

722
01:16:26,093 --> 01:16:27,259
Don't you want us dead?

723
01:16:27,551 --> 01:16:30,134
I just want to be a good man.

724
01:16:34,801 --> 01:16:36,259
Give me another chance?

725
01:16:40,884 --> 01:16:43,718
Sorry, I'm a cop.

726
01:17:45,718 --> 01:17:47,093
Are you OK?

727
01:17:49,759 --> 01:17:50,718
I'm OK.

728
01:17:52,509 --> 01:17:53,468
I'm OK.

729
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:15,509
Do you know what you were doing?

730
01:18:16,218 --> 01:18:17,718
I know. So what?

731
01:18:21,926 --> 01:18:24,884
- Can you take me back to my office?
- Of course.

732
01:18:25,134 --> 01:18:27,551
Are you OK? Come on, let's go.

733
01:19:20,092 --> 01:19:21,051
Good morning.

734
01:19:29,926 --> 01:19:32,759
Your hypnotherapy is really good.

735
01:19:33,592 --> 01:19:34,842
I'm all relaxed.

736
01:19:36,092 --> 01:19:39,759
I've made some progress so I guess
I won't need to go to prison.

737
01:19:45,676 --> 01:19:49,801
We need to work together
in hypnotherapy.

738
01:19:51,884 --> 01:19:53,592
If you don't tell the truth...

739
01:19:54,884 --> 01:19:56,426
...no one can help you.

740
01:19:56,676 --> 01:19:58,426
I'm already very cooperative.

741
01:20:00,551 --> 01:20:03,384
It's OK if you don't
want to talk about the triads...

742
01:20:04,634 --> 01:20:05,967
...but when we're chatting,

743
01:20:06,217 --> 01:20:10,551
you still lie about what films
you like and what you like to eat.

744
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:15,467
I don't understand.

745
01:20:17,467 --> 01:20:19,759
You're not me.
You wouldn't understand.

746
01:20:30,426 --> 01:20:34,217
God didn't mean
for our minds to keep secrets.

747
01:20:36,426 --> 01:20:38,717
I remember when I was a child...

748
01:20:39,759 --> 01:20:42,217
...I stole some chocolate
from a supermarket.

749
01:20:43,426 --> 01:20:46,676
A family-sized bar. A foot long.

750
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:51,426
When I got to the till,
the manager caught me.

751
01:20:52,634 --> 01:20:55,426
I was scared and I just cried.

752
01:20:57,051 --> 01:20:58,384
The manager let me go.

753
01:21:00,176 --> 01:21:03,634
Later, I went to the supermarket
with my mum.

754
01:21:03,884 --> 01:21:05,467
I saw the manager again.

755
01:21:06,884 --> 01:21:09,634
I just felt him staring at me.

756
01:21:09,884 --> 01:21:11,176
I felt uneasy.

757
01:21:12,342 --> 01:21:14,884
My mum asked me what was wrong.

758
01:21:15,926 --> 01:21:17,759
I said the manager had molested me.

759
01:21:18,467 --> 01:21:19,759
My mum called the police.

760
01:21:20,009 --> 01:21:22,426
The police took the manager away.

761
01:21:23,217 --> 01:21:26,051
That manager never told on me.

762
01:21:28,051 --> 01:21:31,051
I never saw him again.

763
01:21:33,217 --> 01:21:34,676
When I went to university,

764
01:21:35,634 --> 01:21:37,467
I finally told this to a classmate.

765
01:21:41,301 --> 01:21:42,592
After I told the story,

766
01:21:43,842 --> 01:21:47,676
I felt like I had been reborn.

767
01:21:51,467 --> 01:21:53,259
Can I really start over again?

768
01:21:55,926 --> 01:21:57,176
Do you trust me?

769
01:21:59,926 --> 01:22:00,967
I do.

770
01:22:01,217 --> 01:22:02,384
I do.

771
01:22:04,217 --> 01:22:05,801
It'll be OK if you trust me.

772
01:22:08,009 --> 01:22:10,175
When did you join the triads?

773
01:22:11,425 --> 01:22:13,175
I didn't want to be in the triads.

774
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:17,259
I want to be a good man.

775
01:22:19,759 --> 01:22:20,842
But...

776
01:22:23,134 --> 01:22:24,592
...I met Mary.

777
01:22:27,092 --> 01:22:28,217
Your wife?

778
01:22:31,134 --> 01:22:32,300
Sam's woman.

779
01:22:34,675 --> 01:22:36,259
Why am I saying this?

780
01:22:39,550 --> 01:22:42,634
You have to trust me
so I can hypnotize you.

781
01:22:42,884 --> 01:22:44,800
Then we can solve your problems.

782
01:22:48,175 --> 01:22:50,050
You can't solve my problems.

783
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,384
My job
is to betray those close to me.

784
01:22:57,217 --> 01:22:58,925
I don't know when I can stop.

785
01:23:02,467 --> 01:23:03,759
I want to survive...

786
01:23:05,634 --> 01:23:07,717
...so I have
to betray those close to me.

787
01:23:10,092 --> 01:23:11,134
Actually, I'm a cop.

788
01:23:12,717 --> 01:23:13,675
I'm a cop.

789
01:23:21,884 --> 01:23:23,592
I don't want to be Sam's mole.

790
01:23:41,592 --> 01:23:42,800
Did I scare you?

791
01:23:45,259 --> 01:23:46,550
Sorry.

792
01:24:00,884 --> 01:24:03,675
Don't worry,
everything will be OK after tomorrow.

793
01:24:13,425 --> 01:24:15,717
Where were you?
The transaction's today.

794
01:24:16,009 --> 01:24:17,217
- Today?
- Yeah.

795
01:24:17,467 --> 01:24:18,592
I've been forgetful.

796
01:24:21,925 --> 01:24:22,925
Hand these out.

797
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:24,842
Yan.

798
01:24:30,759 --> 01:24:32,217
You go in Shen's boat.

799
01:24:32,467 --> 01:24:34,550
Be careful. There are arms in there.

800
01:24:36,134 --> 01:24:37,634
If anything goes wrong...

801
01:24:37,884 --> 01:24:39,175
I know.

802
01:24:39,759 --> 01:24:41,675
You go with me to the dockyard.

803
01:24:50,384 --> 01:24:53,009
Shen and Sam's deal
is happening tonight.

804
01:24:53,259 --> 01:24:56,342
They might be heavily armed.
Wear bulletproof vests.

805
01:24:57,134 --> 01:24:58,925
The water police are standing by.

806
01:24:59,217 --> 01:25:01,384
Teams A and B,
get ready on the hill.

807
01:25:03,509 --> 01:25:04,759
Call the operation off.

808
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:07,550
What are you saying?

809
01:25:08,259 --> 01:25:09,634
It's an order from the top.

810
01:25:16,509 --> 01:25:18,217
An order from the top or from you?

811
01:25:19,925 --> 01:25:21,175
I don't need to explain.

812
01:25:23,842 --> 01:25:27,217
I've been on Sam's trail for years.
What are your ties with him?

813
01:25:28,384 --> 01:25:30,175
This is Security's top secret.

814
01:25:30,425 --> 01:25:33,759
You can make a formal inquiry
to the Assistant Commissioner.

815
01:25:35,467 --> 01:25:37,425
- Call IA and check.
- Yes, sir.

816
01:25:48,175 --> 01:25:50,258
Just do what Yeung says.

817
01:25:50,508 --> 01:25:51,467
I won't.

818
01:25:51,717 --> 01:25:54,592
Wong,
this isn't as simple as you think.

819
01:25:54,842 --> 01:25:56,508
It's very simple for me, sir.

820
01:25:56,758 --> 01:25:58,633
My man is risking his life out there.

821
01:25:59,592 --> 01:26:03,758
Everybody in OCTB stays put. You're
under disciplinary investigation.

822
01:26:06,717 --> 01:26:08,217
What disciplinary issues?

823
01:26:09,133 --> 01:26:12,133
You don't follow orders.
That's a disciplinary issue.

824
01:26:19,217 --> 01:26:20,342
Where are you going?

825
01:26:22,008 --> 01:26:23,508
Back to my office, sir.

826
01:26:27,467 --> 01:26:29,008
You can go.

827
01:26:43,425 --> 01:26:45,050
- Tang.
- Yes.

828
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:47,050
- Turn back.
- OK.

829
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:49,008
Ask everyone to follow our car.

830
01:26:51,258 --> 01:26:54,717
Sam, Yan's doing the transaction.

831
01:28:15,842 --> 01:28:16,800
Hello?

832
01:28:17,050 --> 01:28:20,258
Your wife has agreed to meet you
this afternoon. Is that OK?

833
01:28:23,467 --> 01:28:25,133
Thank you. Thank you.

834
01:28:31,717 --> 01:28:34,800
The Mainlanders
will come in today for extradition.

835
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:37,800
Make sure nothing goes wrong.
Be careful.

836
01:28:38,050 --> 01:28:41,050
- Damon and Fai, you stay here.
- OK.

837
01:28:41,592 --> 01:28:44,258
Set the channel to 34879. OK?

838
01:28:45,050 --> 01:28:47,550
- Tell Transportation we can go now.
- OK.

839
01:29:27,091 --> 01:29:28,050
Thank you.

840
01:30:55,883 --> 01:30:58,633
Inspector Lau,
are you having fun in my office?

841
01:32:18,925 --> 01:32:21,341
Everybody, get ready. Follow me.

842
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:24,300
What's going on?

843
01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:26,508
We're having Yeung round for coffee.

844
01:32:30,383 --> 01:32:34,425
The Mainlanders are chatting inside.
They'll meet our boss in 15 minutes.

845
01:32:34,675 --> 01:32:36,216
Don't make any mistakes.

846
01:32:36,466 --> 01:32:38,633
Damon and Fai,
get the documents ready.

847
01:32:48,174 --> 01:32:49,299
Yeung Kam Wing.

848
01:32:50,299 --> 01:32:52,591
You're suspected
of conspiring with Sam.

849
01:32:52,841 --> 01:32:54,883
Please come back with us to IA.

850
01:32:57,299 --> 01:33:00,341
Inspector Lau,
do you know what you're doing?

851
01:33:00,633 --> 01:33:01,633
I know.

852
01:33:06,258 --> 01:33:07,383
I found a tape.

853
01:33:08,091 --> 01:33:09,966
What tape? I don't understand.

854
01:33:11,091 --> 01:33:12,549
Listen and you will.

855
01:33:40,091 --> 01:33:41,174
Where's Sam?

856
01:33:41,799 --> 01:33:43,049
Sam's not here yet?

857
01:34:04,716 --> 01:34:05,799
They're empty!

858
01:34:07,716 --> 01:34:08,674
Shen!

859
01:34:49,133 --> 01:34:51,674
The arms cost HK$10 million.
Give them back.

860
01:34:51,924 --> 01:34:53,633
Those Mainlanders are animals.

861
01:34:55,133 --> 01:34:57,966
- What if they're setting me up?
- Who told you that?

862
01:34:59,924 --> 01:35:01,383
My life told me so.

863
01:35:02,091 --> 01:35:03,424
What if you're wrong?

864
01:35:04,674 --> 01:35:07,008
Then I'll cooperate with them.

865
01:35:08,674 --> 01:35:10,716
But Yan's going to die either way?

866
01:35:12,383 --> 01:35:15,549
We're all risking our lives
in this business.

867
01:35:16,841 --> 01:35:18,341
I almost died twice.

868
01:35:19,216 --> 01:35:20,799
Sam, don't play games.

869
01:35:21,299 --> 01:35:22,591
Sam!

870
01:35:22,841 --> 01:35:25,008
I've only ever had one guy
work for me!

871
01:35:25,258 --> 01:35:27,299
How can you do this to me?

872
01:35:28,424 --> 01:35:29,924
What are you saying?

873
01:36:10,007 --> 01:36:11,049
Tell me.

874
01:36:13,257 --> 01:36:14,216
Tell me.

875
01:36:15,591 --> 01:36:16,841
Where are my goods?

876
01:36:17,507 --> 01:36:18,924
Where have you put them?

877
01:36:20,466 --> 01:36:21,841
Go and ask Sam yourself.

878
01:36:31,257 --> 01:36:35,007
Why didn't you shoot me in the head?

879
01:36:37,132 --> 01:36:38,091
I didn't aim.

880
01:36:38,382 --> 01:36:39,549
Stand up.

881
01:36:40,507 --> 01:36:41,841
Stand up!

882
01:36:53,424 --> 01:36:55,174
Are you two in this together?

883
01:36:58,341 --> 01:37:00,132
You two are in this together.

884
01:37:00,674 --> 01:37:02,716
Sorry, I'm a cop.

885
01:37:03,466 --> 01:37:04,799
Go ahead and shoot.

886
01:37:05,091 --> 01:37:06,716
It'll save me a bullet.

887
01:37:08,382 --> 01:37:10,841
What? Are you sure you're a cop?

888
01:37:11,674 --> 01:37:15,132
I am.
I got an "A" for writing reports.

889
01:37:15,924 --> 01:37:19,049
After I kill both of you,
I can write what I like.

890
01:37:37,174 --> 01:37:39,007
He's not really Sam's man.

891
01:37:48,632 --> 01:37:50,507
Then you're not really Shen.

892
01:38:07,132 --> 01:38:08,632
You're just in time.

893
01:38:09,674 --> 01:38:11,924
Listen with us. It's interesting.

894
01:38:18,882 --> 01:38:22,049
So you don't want to help me,
Inspector Lau?

895
01:38:22,299 --> 01:38:24,841
I do, but they're watching me.

896
01:38:25,091 --> 01:38:28,966
So you're not worried about me.
You're worried about yourself.

897
01:38:29,216 --> 01:38:30,632
Whatever you say.

898
01:38:32,466 --> 01:38:33,716
You deal with him.

899
01:38:35,341 --> 01:38:38,216
Give me three days.
I'll run a check and call you.

900
01:38:51,632 --> 01:38:52,632
Inspector Lau.

901
01:38:54,591 --> 01:38:58,466
Lau Kin Ming,
this is your last chance.

902
01:38:59,799 --> 01:39:01,132
Don't waste it.

903
01:39:08,466 --> 01:39:11,132
Lau Kin Ming, you're under arrest.

904
01:39:11,382 --> 01:39:15,007
Lau Kin Ming's over there! What are
you doing? What are you doing?

905
01:39:15,966 --> 01:39:19,174
We agreed to arrest him.
Why are you helping him?

906
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:21,507
Yeung found this tape in your room.

907
01:39:21,757 --> 01:39:25,757
- What's the problem?
- That cop was following me.

908
01:39:26,632 --> 01:39:29,549
I'm in charge now.
Call me if you've got transactions.

909
01:39:29,799 --> 01:39:31,882
We got the goods
when we killed the cop.

910
01:39:32,674 --> 01:39:33,841
Cuff him.

911
01:39:34,632 --> 01:39:35,632
What are you doing?

912
01:39:35,924 --> 01:39:37,715
Move back! Sit down!

913
01:39:38,007 --> 01:39:39,507
Sit down! Move back!

914
01:39:39,799 --> 01:39:41,590
- Inspector Lau...
- Move back!

915
01:39:42,299 --> 01:39:43,590
Move back!

916
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:44,965
What are you doing?

917
01:39:50,049 --> 01:39:51,340
I told you to be careful.

918
01:39:51,632 --> 01:39:52,882
Why should I be careful?

919
01:39:53,132 --> 01:39:55,799
Why? I'm a good man.
Why should I be careful?

920
01:39:56,090 --> 01:39:57,299
Why?

921
01:40:03,132 --> 01:40:04,465
I worked so hard.

922
01:40:06,299 --> 01:40:07,465
I helped you kill...

923
01:40:08,757 --> 01:40:10,007
...all of Sam's moles.

924
01:40:10,257 --> 01:40:14,840
Why can't you give me a chance?
Why can't you give me a chance?

925
01:40:15,090 --> 01:40:16,507
I only want to be a good man.

926
01:40:17,465 --> 01:40:18,840
I only want to be a good man.

927
01:40:19,799 --> 01:40:21,924
Why can't
you give me a chance? Why?

928
01:40:22,215 --> 01:40:24,132
Tell me!

929
01:40:25,340 --> 01:40:27,507
Sorry, I'm a cop.

930
01:40:34,924 --> 01:40:37,632
Sorry, I'm a cop.

931
01:40:39,299 --> 01:40:40,382
I'm a cop too!

932
01:41:40,965 --> 01:41:44,007
Are you sure
you won't go to the hospital?

933
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:48,174
People like me can't go out
into the light.

934
01:41:49,590 --> 01:41:50,590
Same here.

935
01:41:51,465 --> 01:41:54,757
I'll get more credits if I bleed.
Did I cause you trouble?

936
01:41:55,049 --> 01:41:56,590
It's just a report.

937
01:41:58,132 --> 01:42:01,090
- Be careful when dealing with Sam.
- You too.

938
01:42:02,465 --> 01:42:04,049
It was Sam who set you up.

939
01:42:04,299 --> 01:42:06,465
You won't bump into me next time.

940
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:10,674
Will we see each other again?

941
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:13,882
- I'll pass.
- Speak Mandarin.

942
01:42:14,132 --> 01:42:16,465
I'm going to Beijing next week.
Come along.

943
01:42:17,549 --> 01:42:18,924
I'll quit after this.

944
01:42:21,507 --> 01:42:22,465
And you?

945
01:42:23,382 --> 01:42:25,382
I'm a mole,

946
01:42:26,132 --> 01:42:27,465
we don't have holidays.

947
01:42:30,174 --> 01:42:31,174
OK.

948
01:42:32,674 --> 01:42:35,090
See you. See you.

949
01:42:35,340 --> 01:42:38,674
You haven't told us yet.
What's your name?

950
01:42:41,090 --> 01:42:42,132
Name?

951
01:42:42,882 --> 01:42:43,965
I don't know.

952
01:42:44,215 --> 01:42:46,174
Just call me Shadow.

953
01:42:46,965 --> 01:42:48,299
That's so corny!

954
01:42:51,424 --> 01:42:52,674
It's time for me to go.

955
01:42:53,674 --> 01:42:57,215
You haven't answered me yet.
I asked you if you recognised me.

956
01:42:59,257 --> 01:43:01,132
At the cadet school in 1991,

957
01:43:01,382 --> 01:43:04,049
if you hadn't left,
I wouldn't have got the Award.

958
01:44:29,298 --> 01:44:32,673
Lau's been taken to the hospital.
He's still in critical condition.

959
01:44:32,882 --> 01:44:35,465
The bullet is in his brain.

960
01:44:36,173 --> 01:44:38,382
The doctors
say that even if he recovers,

961
01:44:38,632 --> 01:44:40,632
his brain will be severely damaged.

962
01:44:40,882 --> 01:44:43,632
His room is full
of information about the moles.

963
01:44:43,882 --> 01:44:46,798
The department
was covered by hidden cameras

964
01:44:47,048 --> 01:44:49,340
that were connected
to Yeung's computer.

965
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:14,798
Hello?

966
01:45:17,632 --> 01:45:18,715
Mary?

967
01:45:20,132 --> 01:45:21,965
He won't be able to meet you.

968
01:45:48,215 --> 01:45:53,090
DECEMBER 2002
TEN DAYS AFTER YAN'S DEATH

969
01:46:05,173 --> 01:46:06,840
He's dead.

970
01:46:07,632 --> 01:46:09,298
What's the point?

971
01:46:13,923 --> 01:46:17,257
There are things we've got to do.

972
01:46:55,298 --> 01:46:57,465
Hey, you're right.

973
01:47:53,215 --> 01:47:54,590
Dr Lee,

974
01:47:55,465 --> 01:47:57,298
everything will be OK after today.

975
01:47:58,256 --> 01:48:01,256
I'll arrest Lau Kin Ming myself.

976
01:48:12,590 --> 01:48:15,840
ONE MONTH LATER

977
01:48:33,423 --> 01:48:35,048
I'm giving it back to you.

978
01:48:38,965 --> 01:48:40,715
He turned me into a cripple.

979
01:49:12,756 --> 01:49:14,465
Was he Yan's friend?

980
01:49:21,131 --> 01:49:24,048
They were in cadet school together.

981
01:49:28,465 --> 01:49:31,756
12 YEARS EARLIER

982
01:49:32,256 --> 01:49:35,131
You have to follow the rules
at cadet school.

983
01:49:35,381 --> 01:49:39,256
Those who break the rules will be
like him. They'll be expelled.

984
01:49:40,298 --> 01:49:42,590
Who wants to trade places with him?

985
01:49:46,465 --> 01:49:49,465
Yeung, congratulations
on getting the Award.

986
01:49:50,215 --> 01:49:52,840
Would he have got it
if he hadn't been expelled?

987
01:50:12,881 --> 01:50:14,381
Perhaps that's fate.

988
01:50:15,589 --> 01:50:18,423
Destiny is destiny.

989
01:50:20,131 --> 01:50:24,131
Men are changed by events,
not events by men.

990
01:50:27,339 --> 01:50:28,464
But these two men...

991
01:50:30,256 --> 01:50:32,214
...they have changed certain events.

992
01:50:37,589 --> 01:50:38,548
OK...

993
01:50:40,089 --> 01:50:41,798
Let bygones be bygones.

994
01:50:44,173 --> 01:50:46,006
Tomorrow is another day.

995
01:50:50,589 --> 01:50:51,589
Bye.

996
01:51:24,089 --> 01:51:28,714
SEVEN MONTHS LATER

997
01:51:59,464 --> 01:52:00,881
You're here?

998
01:52:30,673 --> 01:52:32,256
The baby can say "daddy" now.

999
01:53:03,798 --> 01:53:06,381
He shot me so I shot him back,
like a triad would.

1000
01:53:06,631 --> 01:53:09,006
NOVEMBER 2002
A WEEK BEFORE YAN'S DEATH

1001
01:53:09,256 --> 01:53:12,256
Stop having a go at me
and learn from Yeung.

1002
01:53:12,506 --> 01:53:13,506
Learn what?

1003
01:53:13,756 --> 01:53:15,548
Learn how to write a report.

1004
01:53:15,798 --> 01:53:18,089
If you've killed someone,
it's a big deal.

1005
01:53:18,339 --> 01:53:19,756
So it's OK if I got killed?

1006
01:53:21,006 --> 01:53:22,381
Send me a report.

1007
01:53:22,631 --> 01:53:24,214
I'll send you nothing.

1008
01:53:24,923 --> 01:53:26,089
What did you say?

1009
01:53:35,798 --> 01:53:37,631
- You can go.
- What?

1010
01:53:37,881 --> 01:53:40,089
- Lunchtime.
- I've just had breakfast.

1011
01:53:40,339 --> 01:53:43,172
Would you rather eat shit instead?

1012
01:53:52,881 --> 01:53:54,256
Excuse me.

1013
01:53:54,547 --> 01:53:55,839
What is it?

1014
01:53:57,672 --> 01:54:00,297
I'd like to try this stereo.

1015
01:54:12,214 --> 01:54:14,631
KSITIGARBHA SUTRA:

1016
01:54:14,881 --> 01:54:18,756
SUCH PEOPLE SHALL BE CAST
INTO THE NEVER-ENDING HELL

1017
01:54:19,006 --> 01:54:22,881
AND WILL SUFFER CONTINUOUSLY
FOREVER AND EVER

1018
01:54:23,131 --> 01:54:26,089
WITH NO MEANS OF ESCAPE.
