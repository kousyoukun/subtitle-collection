1
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,389
Yan!

2
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,230
That's enough! Stop!

3
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,234
Stop it!

4
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,678
MAY 2002
SlX MONTHS BEFORE YAN'S DEATH

5
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,116
Do you know what ''messed up'' means?

6
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,229
The first masseuse that came in
looked exactly like Sam's dog

7
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,516
so l asked for a replacement.

8
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,354
The next one that came in
was even worse.

9
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,477
She looked identicalto Sam.

10
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,269
Can you imagine?
Even l couldn't handle that.

11
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,553
She dared to ask me if she
was pretty. Of course l said no.

12
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,313
Then she clawed me.

13
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,675
So l called you.

14
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,148
That's what's screwed up.

15
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,870
You smashed the whole place up.
That's gonna cost me a fortune.

16
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,157
So if a masseuse is ugly,
you're definitely screwed.

17
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,393
How dare you swear at your boss?

18
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,995
Nurse, it's not sore, is it?

19
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,475
Yan...

20
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,312
l asked you to do a small job.
You don't have to be like that.

21
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,072
You moan, that l don't give 
you anything to do.

22
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,595
You don't need to work
in this business.

23
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,434
lf you want to work,
why don't you go and be a cop?

24
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,633
Do you know why
l've only got you under my wing?

25
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,193
lt's because
l like that you're focused.

26
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,158
lt's important to be focused.

27
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,789
Look at Sam. He's focused, isn't he?

28
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,349
As for what happened today...

29
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,113
Don't let Sam know.

30
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,148
Ever since his wife died, he hates us
going to massage parlours.

31
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,073
Why don't you let me go?

32
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,072
Are you done talking? Get inside.

33
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,470
Hey, don't push me, Officer.

34
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,199
That's not the way to behave.

35
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,396
Even cops shouldn't be like that.

36
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,230
So are you going to tell on me?

37
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,390
That's enough.

38
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,838
That's life. Either you get me or l
get you. Are you going to tell on me?

39
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,559
- Fuck off!
- Don't fight!

40
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,358
You're hitting your own boss?

41
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,316
OCTOBER 2003
TEN MONTHS AFTER YAN'S DEATH

42
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,676
File number lO143 -

43
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,230
regarding the deaths of 27149,
Officer Chan Wing Yan

44
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,393
and 34689, Officer Lam Gok Ping.

45
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,350
lnternal Affairs
have produced the following report.

46
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,989
On November 26th 2002,

47
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,952
Senior lnspector Lau Kin Ming of lA

48
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,676
contacted undercover officer,
Chan Wing Yan.

49
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,832
With help from Officer Chan

50
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,709
and from the OCTB unit
in West Kowloon,

51
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,951
Lau toppled Sam's drug operation

52
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,875
and cocaine
worth HK$60 million was seized.

53
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,395
On November 27th 2002,

54
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,473
Officer Chan met with lnspector Lau,

55
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,836
on the rooftop
of the Sei Fong Centre.

56
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,554
Yan supplied information
on triad moles.

57
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,353
You can't get away.

58
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,555
Just wait and see.

59
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,758
You're going to kill a cop?

60
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,599
l know all about you and Sam.

61
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,035
You have no choice.
Come back with me.

62
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,275
Drop your gun.

63
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,356
- What do you want?
- l want to get away.

64
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,838
The preceding testimony was provided
by Senior lnspector Lau Kin Ming.

65
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,389
The committee
of two Chief Superintendents

66
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,791
and the Assistant Commissioner

67
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,310
unanimously believe Lau's testimony.

68
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,558
lnspector Lau's killing

69
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,753
of Officer Lam Kok Ping
has been ruled legal.

70
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,075
Lam has been confirmed as a mole
sent by Sam into the police force.

71
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,239
Finally, it's all over.

72
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,589
You all believe me?

73
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,239
lt's all over.

74
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,719
Stay in Admin for now, OK?

75
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,349
Wait.

76
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,075
Got it.

77
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,039
Your parking space -
wait three weeks. That's it.

78
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,710
Bye.

79
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,953
Officer Chan.

80
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,912
Hold on.

81
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,993
Your uniform's ready.
Come and get it if you're free.

82
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,992
Or l can send it over to you.

83
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,150
No problem! OK. Bye.

84
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,755
lt's a shame Lam destroyed the CCTV.

85
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,718
lt's dragged on for so long.

86
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,428
You know
our bosses go on accountability.

87
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,592
Luckily, you're one of us.
lt was all sorted quickly.

88
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,271
You can come back to lA next month.

89
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,268
Are you tired?

90
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,875
lf you are, you should go
on holiday with Mary.

91
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,955
Hello.

92
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,830
OK.

93
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,312
l'll sign the documents tomorrow.

94
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,230
OK.

95
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,679
We can split it.

96
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,393
We can split it.

97
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,837
We can split anything but the baby!

98
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,668
Hello, Officer Chan,

99
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,995
your uniform's ready.

100
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,356
lf you're busy, l can send it over.

101
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,078
l can do it. OK, wait for me. Bye.

102
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,637
Have l done something wrong?

103
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,677
l feel like beating someone up today.

104
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,954
What's with all the fuss,
Superintendent Yeung?

105
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,478
These Taiwanese men are arms dealers.

106
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,080
Their customers haven't shown up.

107
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,160
They seemed bored,
so l'm keeping them company.

108
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,670
OK?

109
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,234
Sure.

110
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,313
l work in the Security Wing.

111
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,959
l don't like to see
respectable people coming here.

112
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,030
You've got lots of men here.
Help me out.

113
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,479
That's difficult for me.

114
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,511
Would this make it better?

115
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,716
What? You want to set me up?

116
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,034
ls that better?

117
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,274
We've already written the report.

118
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,988
That's half a kilo.
Minimum eight to ten years.

119
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,391
Get two of your men
to come back with me.

120
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,079
They're going to say

121
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,880
they saw them take out some drugs.

122
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,640
Being good citizens,
they beat them up.

123
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,399
l'll give them a Good Citizen Award.

124
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,155
How about that?

125
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,910
Good.

126
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,670
Arrest them.

127
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,510
Be polite.

128
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,436
Sir, you can't go in.

129
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,509
Step aside.

130
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,028
Over there.

131
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,358
Yeung Kam Wing, don't go too far.

132
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,238
l've helped you all these years.

133
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,834
Do you want me dead?

134
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,955
lf l go down,
you'll suffer the consequences.

135
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,310
Won't you give me a chance?

136
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,317
ONE MONTH LATER

137
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,593
Delivery from OCTB?

138
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,754
l was transferred from OCTB yesterday
along with the coffee.

139
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,955
Have a seat.

140
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,673
l've given coffee up.

141
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,878
l need sleeping pills
to get to sleep these days.

142
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,432
l can't sleep if l drink coffee.

143
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,559
Life is so unpredictable. l used
to really hate lnternal Affairs.

144
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,117
And now, l've been transferred here.

145
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,315
You don't seem to be very happy.
l can transfer you elsewhere.

146
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,995
Are you kidding?

147
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,958
l moved here because of you.

148
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,599
The files are on your desk.

149
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,709
The first file...

150
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,316
This sergeant killed himself
in front of his ex-boss, Yeung.

151
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,234
lnternal Affairs
is working on a few big cases.

152
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,398
You know Security are very political.

153
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,832
Everything is classified there.

154
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,112
They won't answer
any questions you ask.

155
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,999
We found a letter
on Sergeant Chun's desk.

156
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,992
There was a tape inside.

157
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,708
lt was a conversation
between him and Sam.

158
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,155
lt turns out he was Sam's mole too.

159
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,628
Besides him, several officers have
also committed suicide or vanished.

160
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,791
They were all Sam's moles.

161
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,792
The bosses say, after Sam's death,

162
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,918
one of the moles is killing
the others to keep his cover.

163
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,118
Leung has ordered us
to find out who he is.

164
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,793
Do you know what happened?

165
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,156
A package was sent to Leung.
Guess what it contained.

166
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,951
lt had tapes of us
giving tips to Sam.

167
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,836
Luckily,
Sergeant Chun was one of us.

168
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,072
- How many more of us are there?
- Five, including you.

169
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,630
Ronald, this is lnspector Lau.

170
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,158
l've left something at Admin.

171
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,319
Hello?

172
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,597
l've found out something on Chun.

173
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,512
He was in the Police Bowling Team.

174
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,670
Wait.

175
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,195
- That's what you asked for.
- Good.

176
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,350
Thanks.

177
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,310
Go on.

178
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,391
He practised at the Lam Wah club.

179
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,870
He rented his flat
from Gam Dok lnvestments,

180
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,792
which owns three big properties.

181
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,031
The owner is Shen, a Mainlander.

182
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,475
l'll e-mail you
the information later.

183
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,599
No, send it to me now.

184
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,274
29TH FLOOR, DRAGON VlEW
GARDEN, BROADCAST DRlVE

185
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,152
lnspector Lau, l'm Yeung Kam Wing
from Security Wing.

186
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,078
l applied for a parking space.

187
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,230
Let me check.

188
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,799
l've waited a whole month.

189
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,918
l don't want to bother you,
but will it take much longer?

190
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,668
Sorry, but l've moved back to lA.

191
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,190
l know,
but Admin asked me to contact you.

192
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,153
Your application's
been approved for a month.

193
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,039
Here. Your parking space is B3A6.

194
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,315
We haven't been able
to reach you for a week.

195
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,152
l've been off for a month.

196
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,311
You know lA is investigating me.

197
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,313
- l know.
- Are you investigating Admin today?

198
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,158
No, l'm just picking up a uniform.

199
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,875
That's a sergeant's uniform,
lnspector.

200
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,960
The man who killed himself
in front of you wore it.

201
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,077
l'm taking it back for investigation.

202
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,879
lsn't the case closed now?

203
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,554
Yes, or you wouldn't be back
from your break.

204
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,233
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

205
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,629
B3A6.

206
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,839
Have we met before?

207
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,390
No.

208
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,599
Do you know someone called Shen?

209
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,109
No.

210
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,669
Mind your own business.

211
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,709
We found these photos
inside Chun's bowling locker.

212
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,712
That's Shen in the photo.

213
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,750
He used to be Sam's business partner.

214
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,231
The man facing him
is Security Wing's Yeung.

215
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,670
He's connected
to the sergeant's death.

216
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,388
l think Yeung could be the mole.

217
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,150
Hello?

218
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,630
See you later.

219
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,834
You're a good person. You come
and see him the moment you get back.

220
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,429
You're a good man.

221
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,669
lf it wasn't for you,
he wouldn't be buried as a cop.

222
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,639
lt was my duty.

223
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,912
l don't know why l helped him.

224
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,750
l only knew him
for about five months.

225
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,399
l've only seen him 21 times.

226
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,154
HE DlED BRAVELY
HlS NOBLE SPlRlT lS ETERNAL

227
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,199
He was a good cop.

228
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,592
Anyone would have helped him.

229
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,949
l'll give you a lift.

230
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,555
Hello.

231
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,239
l'm back.

232
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,309
Let's get started.

233
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,429
There are no triads in China.

234
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,390
What China needs is wealth.

235
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,796
Triads are all about life and death.
Business is all about money.

236
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,395
Today, we're here to talk business.

237
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,799
- But l'm a real triad.
- No.

238
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,632
To me, you're the best businessman.

239
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,919
My brother said so too.

240
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,515
We have HK$100 million to spend.

241
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,637
We want to invest in your business.

242
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,156
We'll ask no questions.

243
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,958
lt's one country, two systems.

244
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:12,357
As long as money breeds money,
we'll let you have full control.

245
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,599
You still believe in that?

246
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,877
You won't be able
to refuse our Mainland ties.

247
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,510
You think a Hong Kong triad can
outlive a Mainland businessman?

248
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,158
Without my brother's connections,
your business in China won't last.

249
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,036
Sam, you're a Buddhist, right?

250
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,352
Amitabha.

251
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,909
ls the feng shui good here?

252
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,071
The best in Hong Kong.

253
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,273
l want to get
a longevity tablet here.

254
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,875
For whom?

255
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,869
For my wife.

256
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,517
She died six months ago.

257
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,999
And also one for myself.

258
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,791
That's a small matter,
l'll handle it.

259
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,072
- A small matter?
- Yes.

260
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,073
lf it's such a small matter,
let my men deal with it.

261
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,798
We'll see how they handle it.

262
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,029
Goodbye.

263
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,795
Bye.

264
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,108
Keung.

265
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,118
You'll deal with his men.

266
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,439
Are you kidding, Sam?

267
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,714
l'm an idiot.
Do you want it messed up?

268
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,236
What does that laugh mean?

269
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,396
Excuse me. Thank you.

270
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,915
That's a lot.

271
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,033
Are you jealous?

272
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,236
ls it legit? Be careful.

273
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,237
Don't worry, boss.

274
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,516
You know how much money l have.

275
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,198
Just ask if you want a loan.
You don't need to threaten me.

276
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,113
- What's this?
- lt's for your baby daughter.

277
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,035
You're a dad now.
You should go home more.

278
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,315
Don't work so hard.

279
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,593
You've lost weight recently.

280
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,791
None of your business. But thanks.

281
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,828
Who are these two?

282
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,272
l only know they're Mainlanders.

283
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,509
Anything else?

284
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,916
Shen was born in Taiyuan, Shanxi.
He's been in the army.

285
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,869
He dealt in antiques. He started
from scratch, now he's loaded.

286
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,673
He came to Hong Kong a year ago.

287
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,515
His brother Liang joined him
and does all the dirty work.

288
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,876
Sam wants to expand to the Mainland.

289
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,799
- What did he want you to talk about?
- Cooperation.

290
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,239
- Liang.
- Yan.

291
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,879
Sit down.

292
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,235
Are you by yourself?

293
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,833
You too, Liang?

294
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,834
We have lots of nightclubs in China.

295
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,353
They're all protected
by local gang bosses.

296
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,311
lnfluential people.

297
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,029
Your goods can move around
our network easily.

298
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,434
We have businesses in 1 1 cities.

299
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,470
Excuse me.

300
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,078
- Hello?
- Well, how's the talk so far?.

301
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,275
Not bad.

302
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,838
See the ashtray in front of you?

303
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,548
Pick it up and smash him with it.

304
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,909
Hit him!

305
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,511
Hit him in the head!

306
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,713
l'm screwed.

307
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,076
- What is it?
- Mary's pregnant.

308
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,794
- Congratulations.
- But we're not married yet.

309
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,110
- Get married then.
- ls that necessary?

310
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,158
- Or she can have an abortion.
- We're already engaged.

311
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,628
Hello?

312
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,029
Got it.

313
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,838
- We can go.
- Let's go.

314
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,191
Long time no see, Wong.

315
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,398
But l saw you last week
with a girl in China.

316
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,198
You don't have to shout.

317
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,670
Security people are full of secrets.

318
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,629
Stop for a minute.

319
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,438
Hey, what's going on?

320
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,472
What are you doing here?

321
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,992
Hey! What's going on?
What are you doing?

322
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,595
Sorry, sir.

323
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,594
We were asked to take some mugshots.
l don't know what's going on either.

324
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,231
l asked ClB to open a file

325
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,356
and take a picture of everyone.

326
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,230
ls that alright?

327
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,113
Officers, are you done?

328
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,035
Everybody's here.

329
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,235
We were investigating Mr Shen...

330
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,677
<i>..</i>but we ended up
being led to Sam by chance.

331
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,839
We even arrested Sam's men.

332
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,790
l'll let ClB handle the triads.

333
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,678
Sam, long time no see. Are you OK?

334
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,468
- What brings you here?
- l'm accompanying some friends.

335
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,474
You Hong Kong Police
are so inefficient.

336
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,119
l'll speed it up then.

337
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,190
He beat you up.

338
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,919
Do you want to press charges?

339
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,191
lf not, then please sign here.

340
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,952
l hit you. Want to press charges?

341
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,355
You're crazy.

342
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,836
Keung, let's go.

343
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,630
Wait.

344
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,238
Do you recognise me?

345
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,639
l recognise you. Be careful.

346
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,078
Wong.

347
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,189
lt's up to you what you do with them.

348
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,512
lt's OK. We all know each other.

349
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,590
ClB colleagues, you can go now.

350
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,353
Thanks, Ming. Thank you.

351
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,999
Just doing my job.

352
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,593
Let's go.

353
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,515
What's your game?

354
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,754
You think l'm playing?
lt's life and death.

355
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,109
l'm glad you know that.

356
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,794
Hurry up and thank me.

357
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,314
Thank you for what?

358
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,028
- Look what you're doing.
- Eating.

359
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,918
You're eating shark fin.

360
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,798
Shark fin, think about it.

361
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,749
When Sam took me to Thailand,
l had shark fin and then l moved up.

362
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,988
You're having shark fin
so you're moving up.

363
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,232
Sam's mean,
but he still bought you shark fin.

364
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,708
Just think about it.

365
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,910
Take him.

366
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,229
Let go of him.

367
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,115
Sam,

368
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,276
are you letting them
take Yan to China?

369
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,272
Ask him why he smashed his head.

370
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,232
He smashed his head?

371
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,390
That's nothing.

372
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,200
ln this job,
either you get them or they get you.

373
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,869
Yan smashed his head, right?
How about this?

374
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,473
ls that alright now?

375
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,270
Liang.

376
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,714
Are you here to make a scene...

377
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,110
<i>..</i>or are you here for business?

378
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,910
Go.

379
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,830
Go!

380
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,748
We're even now.

381
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,119
Let's talk business.

382
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,357
l heard
you have a big arms business.

383
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,676
lf you let me chip in...

384
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,158
<i>..</i>the blood they have spilt
will not be in vain.

385
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,835
Sam.

386
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,949
So?

387
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,594
You're not happy with me?

388
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,870
No.

389
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,473
Have you ever met someone...

390
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,233
<i>..</i>who seems nice...

391
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,757
<i>..</i>but who might kill you at any time?

392
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,153
l've met someone like that.

393
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,953
What do you think, Sam?

394
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,799
l'm wondering...

395
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,788
<i>..</i>why he didn't kill you.

396
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,913
You'll look after
the Mainland business from now on.

397
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,398
Take this for now.

398
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,239
Shen's not what he seems.

399
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,118
Security is investigating him.

400
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,230
He could be smuggling arms.

401
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,391
Sam stopped all his deals in China.

402
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,517
They're going to work together soon.

403
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,273
That's a big deal.

404
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,753
What should l do?

405
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,708
Have you seen the shrink?

406
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,431
Why should l see a shrink?

407
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,877
l persuaded the Department
of Justice not to send you to prison.

408
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:11,477
lt's fine if you don't want to go.
See you in prison. Bye.

409
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,995
Hello? Hello? What's the address?

410
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,510
Bye.

411
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,673
l'm meeting with Dr Lee.

412
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,830
This way.

413
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,159
Are you planning
to spend the night here?

414
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,677
l can't fall asleep in my office.

415
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,989
Unlike him.

416
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,398
He said...

417
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,638
<i>..</i>ever since he became a mole...

418
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,515
<i>..</i>he could only fall asleep here.

419
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,195
l still remember...

420
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,955
That night...

421
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,714
He said everything
would be OK after tomorrow.

422
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,992
And then he died.

423
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,069
You're a doctor.

424
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,753
Do you still have his file?

425
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,477
He may be dead,
but he's still a patient.

426
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,155
- Let's go.
- OK.

427
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,158
THREE HOURS LATER

428
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,314
We found a letter on Sergeant Chun's
desk. There was a tape inside.

429
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,438
lt was a conversation
between him and Sam.

430
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,798
The bosses say, after Sam's death,

431
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,878
one of the moles is killing
the others to keep his cover.

432
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,836
He's connected to Chun's death.

433
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,750
l think Yeung could be the mole.

434
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,870
Do you understand what l said?

435
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,030
Sorry.

436
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,675
l won't sign it
if she doesn't come and meet me.

437
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,875
Do you understand?

438
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,790
OK.

439
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,956
My wife and l
may be getting divorced.

440
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,555
Did l scare you?

441
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,510
Sorry.

442
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,230
Be careful.

443
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,555
Of what?

444
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,913
Your car's next to mine.
l drive badly.

445
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,594
lf l scratch your car,
come and find me.

446
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,555
l'm a good driver.
You don't have to worry.

447
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,277
The Taiwanese we arrested
will be discharged next week.

448
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,590
The Taiwan authorities
have no comment.

449
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,559
The Mainland police
will come for extradition.

450
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,438
l know their boss well.

451
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,989
Stick to the plan and be careful.

452
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,639
When they arrive,

453
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,316
make them feel welcome and take
them out for dinner and shopping.

454
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,757
How about a nightclub?

455
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,319
Macau is better.

456
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,391
You're not afraid of reporters?

457
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,029
We can cover their heads with bags.

458
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,999
- OK, you bring the bags.
- What are you like?

459
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,479
Superintendent Yeung.

460
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,188
lt's Sergeant Chun's memorial
next week.

461
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,476
We're all chipping in for a service.

462
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,512
- Do it properly.
- Yes, sir.

463
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,957
Back to the Mainland police.
Talk to the Macau guys tomorrow.

464
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,988
Let them plan the evening.
l'll talk to them about security.

465
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,871
lf we don't plan, it'll be a mess.
Then we won't have a good time.

466
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,751
Anything to add to your testimony?

467
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,350
No.

468
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,709
Call us any time
if you need anything.

469
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,315
Thank you.

470
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,113
- Are you done?
- Yes.

471
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,995
- ls it OK if l touch things?
- Yes.

472
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,309
OK, thank you.

473
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,437
ls everything OK?

474
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,198
lt was like this when l came in.

475
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,912
They stole some cash and watches.

476
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,633
And the computer's gone.

477
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:29,275
lt's better this way.
l can start from scratch.

478
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,717
But the computer's useless to them.

479
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,032
l locked it with my password.

480
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,354
They won't know
it's my licence plate number.

481
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,835
Your eyes are all red.

482
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,079
You haven't slept?

483
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,314
l've been
following several cases for days.

484
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,999
You should get some sleep.

485
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,033
OK.
Everything will be OK after tomorrow.

486
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,836
l'm off.
Call me if you need anything.

487
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,630
Mr Chan.

488
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,829
AUGUST 16TH 2002
THE FlRST SESSlON

489
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,675
Mr Chan, l'm Dr Lee.

490
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:17,550
l'm obligated to tell you that you've
been ordered to undergo treatment.

491
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,273
You should complete the treatment
in six months.

492
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,438
After that,
l'll submit a report to the Court.

493
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,673
The Court will use that
to decide if you should go to prison.

494
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,110
Prison?

495
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,833
lsn't the treatment enough?

496
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,398
You must follow
doctor's orders during this time

497
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,552
or the Court can revoke the sentence

498
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,314
and detain you for handling.

499
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,549
l see.

500
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,199
Excuse me.

501
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,398
Wong, you git.

502
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:05,031
Dr Lee, you don't need
to call the police. Just call me.

503
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,599
You have my mobile number.

504
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,632
l'll become a wanted criminal.

505
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:17,077
THE SECOND SESSlON

506
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,110
Mr Chan, l'm Dr Lee.

507
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:29,478
l'm obligated to tell you that you've
been ordered to undergo treatment.

508
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,439
You should complete the treatment
in six months.

509
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,591
You'll submit a report to the Court.

510
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:38,549
They'll use this report and they
might put me in prison. l get it.

511
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,112
Please sign here then.

512
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,076
We think you have a violent streak

513
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,749
so we'll use hypnotism
for your treatment.

514
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:50,756
Hypnotism?

515
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:53,669
You signed the form.

516
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,270
Hypnotism?

517
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,793
You can refuse it

518
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,758
but the Court can revoke it.

519
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,473
And lock me up?

520
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,475
Alright, then.

521
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,110
Hypnotize me.

522
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,273
Hypnotize me now.

523
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,269
Let's begin.

524
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,352
Please introduce yourself.

525
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,113
Talk about your family.

526
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,390
Mr Chan?

527
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,430
Mr Chan.

528
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,475
Can you cooperate?

529
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,078
l was practising just in case
you couldn't hypnotize me.

530
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,151
l can hypnotize myself for you.

531
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,231
My will is really strong, you know.

532
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,038
lt's not easy to hypnotize me.

533
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,348
l haven't started yet.

534
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,909
Not yet.

535
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,388
You want to know my story?

536
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,153
My surname isn't really Chan.

537
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,633
l was an illegitimate child.

538
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,919
My dad sold drugs.

539
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,477
l've been working since l was little.

540
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,878
l earned HK$200,000 a month.

541
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,553
l brought a Porsche at 1 7.

542
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,155
l didn't have a licence
so l hired two drivers.

543
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,432
This psychiatry thing is pointless.

544
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,757
lt's either the shrink or prison.

545
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,116
She wants to hypnotize me.

546
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,511
lf l end up revealing everything,
don't blame me.

547
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,715
lt's not that easy. She can't do it
if you don't concentrate.

548
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,718
lt's tough not to concentrate.

549
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,034
Dr Lee is a nice...

550
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,795
<i>..</i>person.

551
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,839
You wouldn't understand.

552
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,474
THE THlRD SESSlON

553
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:12,156
You're looking at the sky.
There are lots of clouds.

554
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,079
You're in the water.

555
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,591
Your body
is wrapped by the warm water.

556
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,313
You feel a sense of weightlessness.

557
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,318
You're floating on the water.

558
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,074
Slowly open your eyes.

559
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,954
The sky is close to you.

560
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:35,910
Then...

561
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,719
What are you doing?

562
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,149
l'm hungry.

563
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,872
My stomach will hurt if l don't eat.

564
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,197
- Are you finished?
- Yes.

565
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,509
Let's start.

566
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,839
Can you see the sea?

567
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,911
You're in the water.
The water is really warm.

568
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,756
lt has wrapped round your whole body.

569
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,912
Next, you feel
a sense of weightlessness.

570
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,597
You have a lot of tricks.

571
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,075
Not really.

572
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:35,118
l'm afraid of oversleeping
during the hypnosis.

573
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,237
lt's best to set an alarm.

574
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,198
lt's not hard to remember.

575
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,670
A Mercedes to Zhanjiang.
A Land Cruiser...

576
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,148
THE FOURTH SESSlON

577
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,717
Write it down if you can't remember!

578
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:57,155
The speedboats
definitely need new motors.

579
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,793
Pink?

580
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,712
We're smuggling, not sailing.

581
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,238
My fax number is 21918125.

582
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:06,550
No fax machine?

583
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,512
Why did you ask for my fax number?

584
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:10,870
E-mail?

585
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,390
E-mail address?

586
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:16,829
No e-mail.

587
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,916
Sorry, l've been really busy.

588
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,751
So are you done with your business?

589
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,513
Let's talk about your family.

590
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,878
You said your dad had three wives.

591
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,473
You have 16 sisters.

592
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,711
Let's talk about your twelfth sister.

593
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,435
l haven't...

594
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,035
Are you OK?

595
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:53,872
- Go away.
- What's wrong?

596
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,314
l haven't answered it.

597
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,955
Better now?

598
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:11,119
The report for the Court
isn't important to me.

599
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:14,670
l'm a doctor.

600
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:16,994
l only want to cure you.

601
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,874
lf you don't want that,
you can leave at any time.

602
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,156
l've been wanting
to tell you something.

603
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:41,877
lf you keep lying, l can't help you.

604
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:07,393
THE... SESSlON

605
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,190
Dr Lee.

606
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,035
Did l do anything else besides sleep?

607
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,110
You don't remember what you've done?

608
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,677
l do remember, but l'm not sure.

609
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:45,312
Forget it. Bye.

610
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,029
Dr Lee.

611
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:02,191
l think you're especially nice to me.

612
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,791
- Do you fancy me?
- You're delusional.

613
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:07,589
Delusional?

614
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,154
No wonder.

615
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,110
Bye.

616
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:30,871
What are you smiling about?
Did she say you'll die tomorrow?

617
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,199
You wouldn't understand.

618
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,957
You think l'm delusional?

619
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,150
Delusional?

620
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:38,910
You are.

621
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,592
Maybe all the hypnotism
has made me delusional.

622
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:44,590
That's...

623
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:47,308
- Hey, watch the road!
- So many cars.

624
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:51,999
They find a woman to mess with your
head so you'll pour your heart out.

625
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,914
lt's not her,
it all to do with Freud.

626
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,438
According to psychoanalysis,

627
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,989
hypnosis can get
to your subconscious.

628
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:04,357
From there,
it can reach your darker side.

629
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:08,997
After reaching that side,
your traumas can be treated.

630
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,878
There'll be symbolic memories.

631
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,439
That's really deep.

632
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,999
l can't help it. lt was written
in the book that Shen gave me.

633
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,239
Are you friends with Shen?

634
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,994
No way. He's the one clinging to me.

635
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:48,830
Mr Shen.

636
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,557
Mr Shen. Let me apologise for Yan.

637
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,392
l'll apologise for him.

638
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:02,317
Have you ever heard the saying,

639
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:05,791
''Men are changed by events,
not events by men?''

640
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:13,395
There's no present without the past.

641
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:15,670
Thank you.

642
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:16,915
What?

643
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:18,750
Good speech.

644
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:22,470
Where's Sam?

645
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,915
He sent the two of us.

646
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:15,270
Sam.

647
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:18,795
Are you reading?

648
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:20,828
Any recommendations?

649
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:21,990
And you?

650
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,148
How To Get Rich in One Day.
lt's good.

651
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,674
l don't need the money.

652
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,198
l've helped you these last few years.

653
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,474
You should speak first.

654
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,760
You already know everything
that l know.

655
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,319
Let's cut the crap.

656
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,595
Will you help me?

657
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:55,272
You help me, l help you.
We'll help each other.

658
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:57,473
Good.

659
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,079
What are you doing here?

660
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:04,790
Me? l'm here...

661
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:01,469
He's gone.

662
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:08,870
Who is he?

663
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:12,030
A pimp.

664
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:14,828
Why were you tailing him?

665
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:19,274
l'm a pimp too.
l want to know if he stole my girls.

666
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:24,030
Actually, l could do with some money.

667
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,673
lf you don't mind,
how about hiring me?

668
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:32,634
Be serious, Dr Lee.

669
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,152
Be serious, pimp.

670
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,631
Hello, lnternal Affairs.

671
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,758
Boss, l saw Yeung with Sam today.

672
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,954
Yeung may be a mole.
Run a check on him.

673
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,759
Sam's deal with Shen
should start soon.

674
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:21,790
Hello?

675
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,438
Uncle Chan, you're here so late.

676
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,398
l'm changing the water.

677
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,477
You're quite something, Uncle Chan.

678
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,876
You know exactly
when we run out of water.

679
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,873
Don'tjust talk, give me a hand.

680
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:21,673
Damon, help him.

681
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:26,910
Let me, Uncle Chan. Let me.

682
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:55,750
Hello?

683
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,558
Why didn't you speakjust then?

684
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,153
Yan sent me a tape.

685
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,876
Chan Wing Yan sent you a tape?

686
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:12,869
Wait for me.

687
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,910
Hey! What's the matter with you?

688
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,639
- l'm busy.
- Wait.

689
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:21,915
What is it?

690
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:24,671
You've been back for two days.

691
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,480
You haven't seen anybody else but me.

692
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,437
Am l supposed to greet everyone?

693
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:32,750
Hey!

694
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:43,715
Did l scare you?

695
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:45,750
Sorry.

696
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,029
Sorry.

697
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:59,238
l don't know why you've
locked yourself up for two days.

698
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:02,631
Whatever it is,
don't take everything on yourself.

699
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,911
Everything will be OK after tomorrow.

700
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:16,150
Lau.

701
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:24,034
The door is over there.

702
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:56,238
PO BOX 27149
CHAN WlNG YlN

703
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:58,869
Let's give it to OCTB.

704
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,479
Have you listened to it?

705
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:12,990
No.

706
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,795
Sam and Shen's transaction
is in two days.

707
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,837
There'll be lots of arms and coke.

708
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,991
l'll contact you before it starts.

709
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,356
So Sam doesn't
completely trust you yet.

710
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,434
Beware of Yeung.

711
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,070
l will.

712
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:54,079
Can you arrest him?

713
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:55,994
You saw them together.

714
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:58,310
That's not enough.
How can l arrest him?

715
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,312
Boss, l'm risking my life for you.

716
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:02,913
Don't tell me that.

717
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:05,631
l'll take care of Yeung.

718
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:12,070
You?

719
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,237
Don't worry. Lau's a great help.

720
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,512
What are you saying?
lt's his fault that you die.

721
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,639
lt was an accident.

722
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,515
Don't you want us dead?

723
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,268
l just want to be a good man.

724
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:32,159
Give me another chance?

725
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:39,319
Sorry, l'm a cop.

726
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,159
Are you OK?

727
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:43,630
l'm OK.

728
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,270
l'm OK.

729
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,432
Do you know what you were doing?

730
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:09,553
l know. So what?

731
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,433
- Can you take me back to my office?
- Of course.

732
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,989
Are you OK? Come on, let's go.

733
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,350
Good morning.

734
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,599
Your hypnotherapy is really good.

735
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:23,594
l'm all relaxed.

736
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:28,315
l've made some progress so l guess
l won't need to go to prison.

737
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,959
We need to work together
in hypnotherapy.

738
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,598
lf you don't tell the truth...

739
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,319
<i>..</i>no one can help you.

740
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,232
l'm already very cooperative.

741
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,999
lt's OK if you don't
want to talk about the triads...

742
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,474
<i>..</i>but when we're chatting,

743
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:57,872
you still lie about what films
you like and what you like to eat.

744
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,588
l don't understand.

745
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,715
You're not me.
You wouldn't understand.

746
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:20,589
God didn't mean
for our minds to keep secrets.

747
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:24,915
l remember when l was a child...

748
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,275
<i>..</i>l stole some chocolate
from a supermarket.

749
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,557
A family-sized bar. A foot long.

750
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:37,116
When l got to the till,
the manager caught me.

751
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:40,953
l was scared and l just cried.

752
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:43,794
The manager let me go.

753
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:48,830
Later, l went to the supermarket
with my mum.

754
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,593
l saw the manager again.

755
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,599
l just felt him staring at me.

756
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,068
l felt uneasy.

757
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,634
My mum asked me what was wrong.

758
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,392
l said the manager had molested me.

759
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,308
My mum called the police.

760
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,869
The police took the manager away.

761
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:10,359
That manager never told on me.

762
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:15,158
l never saw him again.

763
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:18,639
When l went to university,

764
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:21,312
l finally told this to a classmate.

765
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,228
After l told the story,

766
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:31,115
l felt like l had been reborn.

767
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:36,478
Can l really start over again?

768
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,234
Do you trust me?

769
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:43,869
l do.

770
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,235
l do.

771
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,513
lt'll be OK if you trust me.

772
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,710
When did you join the triads?

773
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,592
l didn't want to be in the triads.

774
01:18:58,360 --> 01:18:59,509
l want to be a good man.

775
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:02,955
But...

776
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:06,559
<i>..</i>l met Mary.

777
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,029
Your wife?

778
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:13,955
Sam's woman.

779
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:17,753
Why am l saying this?

780
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:23,878
You have to trust me
so l can hypnotize you.

781
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:25,951
Then we can solve your problems.

782
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:30,997
You can't solve my problems.

783
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,191
My job
is to betray those close to me.

784
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:39,518
l don't know when l can stop.

785
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:44,148
l want to survive...

786
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:47,951
<i>..</i>so l have
to betray those close to me.

787
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:51,229
Actually, l'm a cop.

788
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:53,670
l'm a cop.

789
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:03,198
l don't want to be Sam's mole.

790
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,629
Did l scare you?

791
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,228
Sorry.

792
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,673
Don't worry,
everything will be OK after tomorrow.

793
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,235
Where were you?
The transaction's today.

794
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:54,669
- Today?
- Yeah.

795
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:55,989
l've been forgetful.

796
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:00,155
Hand these out.

797
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:01,989
Yan.

798
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,079
You go in Shen's boat.

799
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:11,311
Be careful. There are arms in there.

800
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,273
lf anything goes wrong...

801
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:15,748
l know.

802
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,151
You go with me to the dockyard.

803
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:29,034
Shen and Sam's deal
is happening tonight.

804
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:32,238
They might be heavily armed.
Wear bulletproof vests.

805
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,718
The water police are standing by.

806
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,070
Teams A and B,
get ready on the hill.

807
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,314
Call the operation off.

808
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:42,994
What are you saying?

809
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,999
lt's an order from the top.

810
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,238
An order from the top or from you?

811
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,074
l don't need to explain.

812
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:01,871
l've been on Sam's trail for years.
What are your ties with him?

813
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,718
This is Security's top secret.

814
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:08,157
You can make a formal inquiry
to the Assistant Commissioner.

815
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,677
- Call lA and check.
- Yes, sir.

816
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,991
Just do what Yeung says.

817
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:25,150
l won't.

818
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:28,153
Wong,
this isn't as simple as you think.

819
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:29,992
lt's very simple for me, sir.

820
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:32,037
My man is risking his life out there.

821
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:36,953
Everybody in OCTB stays put. You're
under disciplinary investigation.

822
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:41,233
What disciplinary issues?

823
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:44,998
You don't follow orders.
That's a disciplinary issue.

824
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:52,869
Where are you going?

825
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:55,913
Back to my office, sir.

826
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:01,199
You can go.

827
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,598
- Tang.
- Yes.

828
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,512
- Turn back.
- OK.

829
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,398
Ask everyone to follow our car.

830
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:25,870
Sam, Yan's doing the transaction.

831
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:44,670
Hello?

832
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:47,992
Your wife has agreed to meet you
this afternoon. ls that OK?

833
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:52,672
Thank you. Thank you.

834
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,958
The Mainlanders
will come in today for extradition.

835
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:04,839
Make sure nothing goes wrong.
Be careful.

836
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:07,958
- Damon and Fai, you stay here.
- OK.

837
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,040
Set the channel to 34879. OK?

838
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:14,189
- Tell Transportation we can go now.
- OK.

839
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:53,070
Thank you.

840
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:20,039
lnspector Lau,
are you having fun in my office?

841
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,429
Everybody, get ready. Follow me.

842
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:42,275
What's going on?

843
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:44,397
We're having Yeung round for coffee.

844
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:51,999
The Mainlanders are chatting inside.
They'll meet our boss in 15 minutes.

845
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:53,719
Don't make any mistakes.

846
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:56,030
Damon and Fai,
get the documents ready.

847
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,269
Yeung Kam Wing.

848
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:09,435
You're suspected
of conspiring with Sam.

849
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:11,636
Please come back with us to lA.

850
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:16,872
lnspector Lau,
do you know what you're doing?

851
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:18,115
l know.

852
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:23,629
l found a tape.

853
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,117
What tape? l don't understand.

854
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:28,599
Listen and you will.

855
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:56,075
Where's Sam?

856
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:57,874
Sam's not here yet?

857
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:19,715
They're empty!

858
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:22,470
Shen!

859
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:03,754
The arms cost HK$10 million.
Give them back.

860
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,638
Those Mainlanders are animals.

861
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:09,799
- What if they're setting me up?
- Who told you that?

862
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:13,079
My life told me so.

863
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,034
What if you're wrong?

864
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:18,470
Then l'll cooperate with them.

865
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:22,036
But Yan's going to die either way?

866
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:26,677
We're all risking our lives
in this business.

867
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:29,353
l almost died twice.

868
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:31,713
Sam, don't play games.

869
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:33,428
Sam!

870
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:35,750
l've only ever had one guy
work for me!

871
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,956
How can you do this to me?

872
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:40,473
What are you saying?

873
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:19,949
Tell me.

874
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:22,990
Tell me.

875
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:25,514
Where are my goods?

876
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:27,513
Where have you put them?

877
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,319
Go and ask Sam yourself.

878
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:42,955
Why didn't you shoot me in the head?

879
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:45,910
l didn't aim.

880
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:47,315
Stand up.

881
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:49,514
Stand up!

882
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:02,312
Are you two in this together?

883
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:07,078
You two are in this together.

884
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,556
Sorry, l'm a cop.

885
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:11,554
Go ahead and shoot.

886
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,398
lt'll save me a bullet.

887
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,355
What? Are you sure you're a cop?

888
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:21,470
l am.
l got an ''A'' for writing reports.

889
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:25,232
After l kill both of you,
l can write what l like.

890
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:44,392
He's not really Sam's man.

891
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:55,437
Then you're not really Shen.

892
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:12,833
You're just in time.

893
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:15,990
Listen with us. lt's interesting.

894
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:25,717
So you don't want to help me,
lnspector Lau?

895
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:28,394
l do, but they're watching me.

896
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:32,349
So you're not worried about me.
You're worried about yourself.

897
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:33,953
Whatever you say.

898
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:36,914
You deal with him.

899
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:41,233
Give me three days.
l'll run a check and call you.

900
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:55,075
lnspector Lau.

901
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:00,669
Lau Kin Ming,
this is your last chance.

902
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:03,234
Don't waste it.

903
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:12,840
Lau Kin Ming, you're under arrest.

904
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:16,550
Lau Kin Ming's over there! What are
you doing? What are you doing?

905
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:20,552
We agreed to arrest him.
Why are you helping him?

906
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,791
Yeung found this tape in your room.

907
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:26,874
- What's the problem?
- That cop was following me.

908
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:30,518
l'm in charge now.
Call me if you've got transactions.

909
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:32,751
We got the goods
when we killed the cop.

910
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:34,635
Cuff him.

911
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:36,355
What are you doing?

912
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:38,358
Move back! Sit down!

913
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:40,073
Sit down! Move back!

914
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:42,078
- lnspector Lau...
- Move back!

915
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:43,988
Move back!

916
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:45,309
What are you doing?

917
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:51,428
l told you to be careful.

918
01:35:51,720 --> 01:35:52,914
Why should l be careful?

919
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:55,720
Why? l'm a good man.
Why should l be careful?

920
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,149
Why?

921
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:04,034
l worked so hard.

922
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:06,915
l helped you kill...

923
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:09,354
<i>..</i>all of Sam's moles.

924
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:13,991
Why can't you give me a chance?
Why can't you give me a chance?

925
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:15,593
l only want to be a good man.

926
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:17,839
l only want to be a good man.

927
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:20,796
Why can't
you give me a chance? Why?

928
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:22,911
Tell me!

929
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:26,150
Sorry, l'm a cop.

930
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,874
Sorry, l'm a cop.

931
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:38,515
l'm a cop too!

932
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:39,592
Are you sure
you won't go to the hospital?

933
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:43,599
People like me can't go out
into the light.

934
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:45,915
Same here.

935
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:49,911
l'll get more credits if l bleed.
Did l cause you trouble?

936
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:51,679
lt's just a report.

937
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:55,993
- Be careful when dealing with Sam.
- You too.

938
01:37:57,320 --> 01:37:58,833
lt was Sam who set you up.

939
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:01,150
You won't bump into me next time.

940
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:05,190
Will we see each other again?

941
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:08,274
- l'll pass.
- Speak Mandarin.

942
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:10,750
l'm going to Beijing next week.
Come along.

943
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:13,119
l'll quit after this.

944
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:16,510
And you?

945
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:19,311
l'm a mole,

946
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:21,314
we don't have holidays.

947
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:24,875
OK.

948
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,629
See you. See you.

949
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:32,077
You haven't told us yet.
What's your name?

950
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:35,389
Name?

951
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:37,155
l don't know.

952
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:39,277
Just call me Shadow.

953
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:41,314
That's so corny!

954
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:45,514
lt's time for me to go.

955
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:49,870
You haven't answered me yet.
l asked you if you recognised me.

956
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:53,637
At the cadet school in 1991 ,

957
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:56,440
if you hadn't left,
l wouldn't have got the Award.

958
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:21,511
Lau's been taken to the hospital.
He's still in critical condition.

959
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:24,188
The bullet is in his brain.

960
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,996
The doctors
say that even if he recovers,

961
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:29,151
his brain will be severely damaged.

962
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:32,039
His room is full
of information about the moles.

963
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:35,078
The department
was covered by hidden cameras

964
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:37,515
that were connected
to Yeung's computer.

965
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:01,950
Hello?

966
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:05,715
Mary?

967
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:08,832
He won't be able to meet you.

968
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:38,716
DECEMBER 2002
TEN DAYS AFTER YAN'S DEATH

969
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:51,912
He's dead.

970
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:54,272
What's the point?

971
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:01,917
There are things we've got to do.

972
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:40,510
Hey, you're right.

973
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:35,359
Dr Lee,

974
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:37,952
everything will be OK after today.

975
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:41,758
l'll arrest Lau Kin Ming myself.

976
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:55,757
ONE MONTH LATER

977
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:14,198
l'm giving it back to you.

978
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:19,632
He turned me into a cripple.

979
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:52,038
Was he Yan's friend?

980
01:44:58,440 --> 01:45:01,238
They were in cadet school together.

981
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:08,631
12 YEARS EARLlER

982
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:11,873
You have to follow the rules
at cadet school.

983
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:15,829
Those who break the rules will be
like him. They'll be expelled.

984
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:19,035
Who wants to trade places with him?

985
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:25,638
Yeung, congratulations
on getting the Award.

986
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:28,874
Would he have got it
if he hadn't been expelled?

987
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:49,553
Perhaps that's fate.

988
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:53,439
Destiny is destiny.

989
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:58,914
Men are changed by events,
not events by men.

990
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,069
But these two men...

991
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:06,677
<i>..</i>they have changed certain events.

992
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:12,750
OK...

993
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:15,878
Let bygones be bygones.

994
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:19,912
Tomorrow is another day.

995
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:25,275
Bye.

996
01:46:56,480 --> 01:47:00,917
SEVEN MONTHS LATER

997
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:31,793
You're here?

998
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:01,913
The baby can say ''daddy'' now.

999
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:34,668
He shot me so l shot him back,
like a triad would.

1000
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:37,195
NOVEMBER 2002
A WEEK BEFORE YAN'S DEATH

1001
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:40,318
Stop having a go at me
and learn from Yeung.

1002
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:41,515
Learn what?

1003
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,478
Learn how to write a report.

1004
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:45,915
lf you've killed someone,
it's a big deal.

1005
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:47,513
So it's OK if l got killed?

1006
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:50,039
Send me a report.

1007
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:51,793
l'll send you nothing.

1008
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:53,595
What did you say?

1009
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:04,672
- You can go.
- What?

1010
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:07,036
- Lunchtime.
- l've just had breakfast.

1011
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:09,999
Would you rather eat shit instead?

1012
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:20,639
Excuse me.

1013
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:22,148
What is it?

1014
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:26,434
l'd like to try this stereo.

1015
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:40,189
KSlTlGARBHA SUTRA:

1016
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:44,149
SUCH PEOPLE SHALL BE CAST
lNTO THE NEVER-ENDlNG HELL

1017
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:48,109
AND WlLL SUFFER CONTlNUOUSLY
FOREVER AND EVER

1018
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:51,193
WlTH NO MEANS OF ESCAPE.
