1
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,086
Yan!

2
00:01:00,777 --> 00:01:02,927
That's enough! Stop!

3
00:01:04,657 --> 00:01:05,931
Stop it!

4
00:01:22,017 --> 00:01:27,375
MAY 2002
SIX MONTHS BEFORE YAN'S DEATH

5
00:01:34,697 --> 00:01:36,813
Do you know what "messed up" means?

6
00:01:37,057 --> 00:01:41,926
The first masseuse that came in
looked exactly like Sam's dog

7
00:01:42,177 --> 00:01:44,213
so I asked for a replacement.

8
00:01:44,457 --> 00:01:47,051
The next one that came in
was even worse.

9
00:01:47,297 --> 00:01:49,174
She looked identical to Sam.

10
00:01:49,417 --> 00:01:52,966
Can you imagine?
Even I couldn't handle that.

11
00:01:53,257 --> 00:01:57,250
She had the audacity to ask me if she
was pretty. Of course I said no.

12
00:01:57,497 --> 00:01:59,010
Then she clawed me.

13
00:01:59,257 --> 00:02:00,372
So I called you.

14
00:02:00,617 --> 00:02:01,845
That's when we messed up.

15
00:02:02,097 --> 00:02:05,567
You smashed the whole place up.
It'll cost me a fortune in damages.

16
00:02:05,817 --> 00:02:08,854
So if a masseuse is ugly,
you're definitely screwed.

17
00:02:12,337 --> 00:02:15,090
Why are you swearing at your boss?

18
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:18,692
Nurse, it's not sore, is it?

19
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,172
Yan...

20
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:25,009
I asked you to do a small job.
You don't have to be like that.

21
00:02:25,857 --> 00:02:28,769
You moan
that I don't give you anything to do.

22
00:02:29,017 --> 00:02:31,292
You don't need to work
in this business.

23
00:02:31,537 --> 00:02:34,131
If you want to work,
why don't you go and be a cop?

24
00:02:36,497 --> 00:02:39,330
Do you know why
I've only got you under my wing?

25
00:02:40,057 --> 00:02:42,890
It's because
I like that you're focused.

26
00:02:43,137 --> 00:02:44,855
It's important to be focused.

27
00:02:45,097 --> 00:02:47,486
Look at Sam. He's focused, isn't he?

28
00:02:47,737 --> 00:02:50,046
As for what happened today...

29
00:02:50,297 --> 00:02:51,810
Don't let Sam know.

30
00:02:52,057 --> 00:02:55,845
Ever since his wife died, he hates us
going to massage parlours.

31
00:02:56,417 --> 00:02:57,770
Why don't you let me go?

32
00:02:58,017 --> 00:02:59,769
Are you done talking? Get inside.

33
00:03:00,017 --> 00:03:02,167
Hey, don't push me, Officer.

34
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:03,896
That's not the way to behave.

35
00:03:04,137 --> 00:03:06,093
Even cops shouldn't be like that.

36
00:03:06,777 --> 00:03:08,927
So are you going to tell on me?

37
00:03:09,177 --> 00:03:10,087
That's enough.

38
00:03:10,337 --> 00:03:14,535
That's life. Either you get me or I
get you. Are you going to tell on me?

39
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,256
- Fuck off!
- Don't fight!

40
00:03:16,497 --> 00:03:18,055
You're hitting your own boss?

41
00:04:43,337 --> 00:04:48,013
OCTOBER 2003
TEN MONTHS AFTER YAN'S DEATH

42
00:04:48,257 --> 00:04:50,373
File number IO143 -

43
00:04:50,617 --> 00:04:53,927
regarding the deaths of 27149,
Officer Chan Wing Yan

44
00:04:54,177 --> 00:04:58,090
and 34689, Officer Lam Gok Ping.

45
00:04:58,737 --> 00:05:02,047
Internal Affairs
have produced the following report.

46
00:05:02,297 --> 00:05:04,686
On November 26th 2002,

47
00:05:04,977 --> 00:05:06,649
Senior Inspector Lau Kin Ming of IA

48
00:05:06,937 --> 00:05:10,373
contacted undercover officer,
Chan Wing Yan.

49
00:05:10,617 --> 00:05:13,529
With help from Officer Chan

50
00:05:13,777 --> 00:05:17,406
and from the OCTB unit
in West Kowloon,

51
00:05:17,657 --> 00:05:19,648
Lau toppled Sam's drug operation

52
00:05:19,897 --> 00:05:23,572
and cocaine
worth HK$60 million was seized.

53
00:05:23,817 --> 00:05:26,092
On November 27th 2002,

54
00:05:26,337 --> 00:05:29,170
Officer Chan met with Inspector Lau,

55
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:31,533
on the rooftop
of the Sei Fong Centre.

56
00:05:31,817 --> 00:05:34,251
Yan supplied information
on triad moles.

57
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,050
You can't get away.

58
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:39,252
Just wait and see.

59
00:05:41,897 --> 00:05:43,455
You're going to kill a cop?

60
00:05:47,577 --> 00:05:50,296
I know all about you and Sam.

61
00:05:50,537 --> 00:05:52,732
You have no choice.
Come back with me.

62
00:05:53,017 --> 00:05:53,972
Drop your gun.

63
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:01,053
- What do you want?
- I want to get away.

64
00:06:13,257 --> 00:06:17,535
The preceding testimony was provided
by Senior Inspector Lau Kin Ming.

65
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,086
The committee
of two Chief Superintendents

66
00:06:20,577 --> 00:06:22,488
and the Assistant Commissioner

67
00:06:22,777 --> 00:06:25,007
unanimously believe Lau's testimony.

68
00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:28,255
Inspector Lau's killing

69
00:06:28,537 --> 00:06:32,450
of Officer Lam Kok Ping
has been ruled legal.

70
00:06:32,937 --> 00:06:37,772
Lam has been confirmed as a mole
sent by Sam into the police force.

71
00:06:38,457 --> 00:06:39,936
Finally, it's all over.

72
00:06:43,217 --> 00:06:44,286
You all believe me?

73
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:45,936
It's all over.

74
00:06:46,937 --> 00:06:48,416
Stay in Admin for now, OK?

75
00:06:51,057 --> 00:06:52,046
Wait.

76
00:06:53,817 --> 00:06:54,772
Got it.

77
00:06:55,017 --> 00:06:57,736
Your parking space -
wait three weeks. That's it.

78
00:06:58,497 --> 00:06:59,407
Bye.

79
00:07:00,297 --> 00:07:01,650
Officer Chan.

80
00:07:01,937 --> 00:07:03,609
Hold on.

81
00:07:04,937 --> 00:07:07,690
Your uniform's ready.
Come and get it if you're free.

82
00:07:07,937 --> 00:07:09,689
Or I can send it over to you.

83
00:07:10,617 --> 00:07:12,847
No problem! OK. Bye.

84
00:07:13,097 --> 00:07:15,452
It's a shame Lam destroyed the CCTV.

85
00:07:15,697 --> 00:07:17,415
It's dragged on for so long.

86
00:07:17,657 --> 00:07:20,125
You know
our bosses go on accountability.

87
00:07:20,377 --> 00:07:23,289
Luckily, you're one of us.
It was all sorted quickly.

88
00:07:24,137 --> 00:07:25,968
You can come back to IA next month.

89
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:27,965
Are you tired?

90
00:07:28,217 --> 00:07:30,572
If you are, you should go
on holiday with Mary.

91
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,652
Hello.

92
00:07:42,617 --> 00:07:43,527
OK.

93
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,009
I'll sign the documents tomorrow.

94
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:50,927
OK.

95
00:07:52,057 --> 00:07:53,376
We can split it.

96
00:07:54,577 --> 00:07:56,090
We can split it.

97
00:08:00,737 --> 00:08:02,534
We can split anything but the baby!

98
00:08:12,137 --> 00:08:13,365
Hello, Officer Chan,

99
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,692
your uniform's ready.

100
00:08:15,937 --> 00:08:18,053
If you're busy, I can send it over.

101
00:08:18,897 --> 00:08:21,775
I can do it. OK, wait for me. Bye.

102
00:09:05,537 --> 00:09:07,334
Have I done something wrong?

103
00:09:10,497 --> 00:09:12,374
I feel like beating someone up today.

104
00:09:17,137 --> 00:09:19,651
What's with all the fuss,
Superintendent Yeung?

105
00:09:23,377 --> 00:09:26,175
These Taiwanese men are arms dealers.

106
00:09:27,217 --> 00:09:29,777
Their customers haven't shown up.

107
00:09:31,297 --> 00:09:33,857
They seemed bored,
so I'm keeping them company.

108
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:35,367
OK?

109
00:09:35,657 --> 00:09:36,931
Sure.

110
00:09:39,657 --> 00:09:41,010
I work in the Security Wing.

111
00:09:42,937 --> 00:09:45,656
I don't like to see
respectable people coming here.

112
00:09:46,497 --> 00:09:48,727
You've got lots of men here.
Help me out.

113
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,176
That's difficult for me.

114
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,208
Would this make it better?

115
00:09:59,457 --> 00:10:01,413
What? You want to set me up?

116
00:10:11,537 --> 00:10:12,731
Is that better?

117
00:10:13,537 --> 00:10:15,971
We've already written the report.

118
00:10:16,217 --> 00:10:18,685
That's half a kilo.
Minimum eight to ten years.

119
00:10:35,097 --> 00:10:37,088
Get two of your men
to come back with me.

120
00:10:38,377 --> 00:10:39,776
They're going to say

121
00:10:40,017 --> 00:10:42,577
they saw them take out some drugs.

122
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:46,337
Being good citizens,
they beat them up.

123
00:10:48,377 --> 00:10:51,096
I'll give them a Good Citizen Award.

124
00:10:51,897 --> 00:10:52,852
How about that?

125
00:10:53,697 --> 00:10:54,607
Good.

126
00:10:55,457 --> 00:10:56,367
Arrest them.

127
00:10:58,297 --> 00:10:59,207
Be polite.

128
00:11:15,017 --> 00:11:17,133
Sir, you can't go in.

129
00:11:20,217 --> 00:11:21,206
Step aside.

130
00:11:23,497 --> 00:11:24,725
Over there.

131
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:27,055
Yeung Kam Wing, don't go too far.

132
00:11:27,297 --> 00:11:28,935
I've helped you all these years.

133
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:32,531
Do you want me dead?

134
00:11:49,297 --> 00:11:51,652
If I go down,
you'll suffer the consequences.

135
00:11:52,777 --> 00:11:55,007
Won't you give me a chance?

136
00:12:08,817 --> 00:12:12,014
ONE MONTH LATER

137
00:12:57,857 --> 00:12:59,290
Delivery from OCTB?

138
00:13:01,457 --> 00:13:06,451
I was transferred from OCTB yesterday
along with the coffee.

139
00:13:06,697 --> 00:13:07,652
Have a seat.

140
00:13:08,857 --> 00:13:10,370
I've given coffee up.

141
00:13:10,617 --> 00:13:13,575
I need sleeping pills
to get to sleep these days.

142
00:13:14,537 --> 00:13:16,129
I can't sleep if I drink coffee.

143
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:24,256
Life is so unpredictable. I used
to really hate Internal Affairs.

144
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,814
And now, I've been transferred here.

145
00:13:29,337 --> 00:13:33,012
You don't seem to be very happy.
I can transfer you elsewhere.

146
00:13:35,577 --> 00:13:36,692
Are you kidding?

147
00:13:36,937 --> 00:13:38,655
I moved here because of you.

148
00:13:39,817 --> 00:13:41,296
The files are on your desk.

149
00:13:42,257 --> 00:13:43,406
The first file...

150
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:47,013
This sergeant killed himself
in front of his ex-boss, Yeung.

151
00:13:48,497 --> 00:13:50,931
Internal Affairs
is working on a few big cases.

152
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:55,095
You know Security are very political.

153
00:13:55,777 --> 00:13:57,529
Everything is classified there.

154
00:13:57,817 --> 00:14:00,809
They won't answer
any questions you ask.

155
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:03,696
We found a letter
on Sergeant Chun's desk.

156
00:14:03,937 --> 00:14:05,689
There was a tape inside.

157
00:14:05,937 --> 00:14:08,405
It was a conversation
between him and Sam.

158
00:14:08,657 --> 00:14:10,852
It turns out he was Sam's mole too.

159
00:14:11,537 --> 00:14:15,325
Besides him, several officers have
also committed suicide or vanished.

160
00:14:15,577 --> 00:14:17,488
They were all Sam's moles.

161
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:19,489
The bosses say, after Sam's death,

162
00:14:19,737 --> 00:14:22,615
one of the moles is killing
the others to keep his cover.

163
00:14:22,857 --> 00:14:25,815
Leung has ordered us
to find out who he is.

164
00:14:26,057 --> 00:14:27,490
Do you know what happened?

165
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:31,853
A package was sent to Leung.
Guess what it contained.

166
00:14:34,737 --> 00:14:36,648
It had tapes of us
giving tips to Sam.

167
00:14:38,497 --> 00:14:40,533
Luckily,
Sergeant Chun was one of us.

168
00:14:40,777 --> 00:14:43,769
- How many more of us are there?
- Five, including you.

169
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,327
Ronald, this is Inspector Lau.

170
00:14:54,297 --> 00:14:55,855
I've left something at Admin.

171
00:15:01,537 --> 00:15:03,016
Hello?

172
00:15:03,257 --> 00:15:06,294
I've found out something on Chun.

173
00:15:06,537 --> 00:15:08,209
He was in the Police Bowling Team.

174
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:09,367
Wait.

175
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,892
- That's what you asked for.
- Good.

176
00:15:12,137 --> 00:15:13,047
Thanks.

177
00:15:14,097 --> 00:15:15,007
Go on.

178
00:15:15,257 --> 00:15:17,088
He practised at the Lam Wah club.

179
00:15:17,337 --> 00:15:19,567
He rented his flat
from Gam Dok Investments,

180
00:15:19,817 --> 00:15:21,489
which owns three big properties.

181
00:15:21,737 --> 00:15:23,728
The owner is Shen, a Mainlander.

182
00:15:23,977 --> 00:15:26,172
I'll e-mail you
the information later.

183
00:15:26,977 --> 00:15:28,296
No, send it to me now.

184
00:15:35,457 --> 00:15:37,971
29TH FLOOR, DRAGON VIEW
GARDEN, BROADCAST DRIVE

185
00:15:42,857 --> 00:15:45,849
Inspector Lau, I'm Yeung Kam Wing
from Security Wing.

186
00:15:46,137 --> 00:15:47,775
I applied for a parking space.

187
00:15:48,017 --> 00:15:48,927
Let me check.

188
00:15:49,177 --> 00:15:50,496
I've waited a whole month.

189
00:15:50,737 --> 00:15:53,615
I don't want to bother you,
but will it take much longer?

190
00:15:53,897 --> 00:15:56,365
Sorry, but I've moved back to IA.

191
00:15:58,497 --> 00:16:01,887
I know,
but Admin asked me to contact you.

192
00:16:03,017 --> 00:16:05,850
Your application's
been approved for a month.

193
00:16:06,097 --> 00:16:08,736
Here. Your parking space is B3A6.

194
00:16:09,657 --> 00:16:12,012
We haven't been able
to reach you for a week.

195
00:16:12,257 --> 00:16:13,849
I've been off for a month.

196
00:16:14,097 --> 00:16:16,008
You know IA is investigating me.

197
00:16:16,257 --> 00:16:19,010
- I know.
- Are you investigating Admin today?

198
00:16:20,137 --> 00:16:21,855
No, I'm just picking up a uniform.

199
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:25,572
That's a sergeant's uniform,
Inspector.

200
00:16:30,097 --> 00:16:32,657
The man who killed himself
in front of you wore it.

201
00:16:32,897 --> 00:16:34,774
I'm taking it back for investigation.

202
00:16:36,097 --> 00:16:37,576
Isn't the case closed now?

203
00:16:37,817 --> 00:16:40,251
Yes, or you wouldn't be back
from your break.

204
00:16:40,497 --> 00:16:41,930
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

205
00:16:42,177 --> 00:16:43,326
B3A6.

206
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:53,536
Have we met before?

207
00:16:54,177 --> 00:16:55,087
No.

208
00:16:56,577 --> 00:16:59,296
Do you know someone called Shen?

209
00:17:00,737 --> 00:17:01,806
No.

210
00:17:02,057 --> 00:17:04,366
Mind your own business.

211
00:17:06,857 --> 00:17:10,406
We found these photos
inside Chun's bowling locker.

212
00:17:11,817 --> 00:17:13,409
That's Shen in the photo.

213
00:17:14,297 --> 00:17:16,447
He used to be Sam's business partner.

214
00:17:16,697 --> 00:17:19,928
The man facing him
is Security Wing's Yeung.

215
00:17:20,217 --> 00:17:22,367
He's connected
to the sergeant's death.

216
00:17:22,617 --> 00:17:25,085
I think Yeung could be the mole.

217
00:18:32,937 --> 00:18:33,847
Hello?

218
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:40,327
See you later.

219
00:19:02,697 --> 00:19:06,531
You're a good person. You come
and see him the moment you get back.

220
00:19:10,057 --> 00:19:11,126
You're a good man.

221
00:19:12,737 --> 00:19:16,366
If it wasn't for you,
he wouldn't be buried as a cop.

222
00:19:20,017 --> 00:19:21,336
It was my duty.

223
00:19:24,017 --> 00:19:25,609
I don't know why I helped him.

224
00:19:27,297 --> 00:19:29,447
I only knew him
for about five months.

225
00:19:29,697 --> 00:19:31,096
I've only seen him 21 times.

226
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,851
HE DIED BRAVELY
HIS NOBLE SPIRIT IS ETERNAL

227
00:19:35,497 --> 00:19:36,896
He was a good cop.

228
00:19:38,617 --> 00:19:40,289
Anyone would have helped him.

229
00:19:50,497 --> 00:19:51,646
I'll give you a lift.

230
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:14,252
Hello.

231
00:20:15,617 --> 00:20:16,936
I'm back.

232
00:20:17,857 --> 00:20:19,006
Let's get started.

233
00:20:27,737 --> 00:20:30,126
There are no triads in China.

234
00:20:34,857 --> 00:20:37,087
What China needs is wealth.

235
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:41,493
Triads are all about life and death.
Business is all about money.

236
00:20:41,737 --> 00:20:44,092
Today, we're here to talk business.

237
00:20:46,857 --> 00:20:49,496
- But I'm a real triad.
- No.

238
00:20:50,257 --> 00:20:53,329
To me, you're the best businessman.

239
00:20:54,137 --> 00:20:55,616
My brother said so too.

240
00:20:56,857 --> 00:20:59,212
We have HK$100 million to spend.

241
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:01,334
We want to invest in your business.

242
00:21:02,737 --> 00:21:04,853
We'll ask no questions.

243
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,655
It's one country, two systems.

244
00:21:07,617 --> 00:21:12,054
As long as money breeds money,
we'll let you have full control.

245
00:21:12,977 --> 00:21:14,296
You still believe in that?

246
00:21:17,537 --> 00:21:20,574
You won't be able
to refuse our Mainland ties.

247
00:21:20,817 --> 00:21:24,207
You think a Hong Kong triad can
outlive a Mainland businessman?

248
00:21:25,737 --> 00:21:29,855
Without my brother's connections,
your business in China won't last.

249
00:21:36,377 --> 00:21:39,733
Sam, you're a Buddhist, right?

250
00:21:41,457 --> 00:21:43,049
Amitabha.

251
00:21:49,217 --> 00:21:51,606
Is the feng shui good here?

252
00:21:51,857 --> 00:21:53,768
The best in Hong Kong.

253
00:21:55,217 --> 00:21:57,970
I want to get
a longevity tablet here.

254
00:21:59,457 --> 00:22:00,572
For whom?

255
00:22:03,497 --> 00:22:04,566
For my wife.

256
00:22:06,177 --> 00:22:09,214
She died six months ago.

257
00:22:12,057 --> 00:22:14,696
And also one for myself.

258
00:22:18,497 --> 00:22:20,488
That's a small matter,
I'll handle it.

259
00:22:21,177 --> 00:22:22,769
- A small matter?
- Yes.

260
00:22:23,937 --> 00:22:26,770
If it's such a small matter,
let my men deal with it.

261
00:22:27,777 --> 00:22:29,495
We'll see how they handle it.

262
00:22:31,737 --> 00:22:32,726
Goodbye.

263
00:22:33,457 --> 00:22:34,492
Bye.

264
00:22:45,577 --> 00:22:46,805
Keung.

265
00:22:48,097 --> 00:22:49,815
You'll deal with his men.

266
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:52,136
Are you kidding, Sam?

267
00:22:52,977 --> 00:22:55,411
I'm an idiot.
Do you want it messed up?

268
00:23:02,977 --> 00:23:04,933
What does that laugh mean?

269
00:23:38,057 --> 00:23:40,093
Excuse me. Thank you.

270
00:23:49,657 --> 00:23:50,612
That's a lot.

271
00:23:51,377 --> 00:23:52,730
Are you jealous?

272
00:23:52,977 --> 00:23:54,933
Is it legit? Be careful.

273
00:23:56,057 --> 00:23:57,934
Don't worry, boss.

274
00:23:58,177 --> 00:24:00,213
You know how much money I have.

275
00:24:00,937 --> 00:24:03,895
Just ask if you want a loan.
You don't need to threaten me.

276
00:24:06,057 --> 00:24:08,810
- What's this?
- It's for your baby daughter.

277
00:24:10,377 --> 00:24:12,732
You're a dad now.
You should go home more.

278
00:24:12,977 --> 00:24:14,012
Don't work so hard.

279
00:24:16,537 --> 00:24:19,290
You've lost weight recently.

280
00:24:19,577 --> 00:24:21,488
None of your business. But thanks.

281
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:25,525
Who are these two?

282
00:24:26,297 --> 00:24:27,969
I only know they're Mainlanders.

283
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,206
Anything else?

284
00:24:35,337 --> 00:24:38,613
Shen was born in Taiyuan, Shanxi.
He's been in the army.

285
00:24:38,857 --> 00:24:42,566
He dealt in antiques. He started
from scratch, now he's loaded.

286
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:44,370
He came to Hong Kong a year ago.

287
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:48,212
His brother Liang joined him
and does all the dirty work.

288
00:24:48,457 --> 00:24:50,573
Sam wants to expand to the Mainland.

289
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:53,496
- What did he want you to talk about?
- Cooperation.

290
00:24:54,537 --> 00:24:55,936
- Liang.
- Yan.

291
00:24:56,177 --> 00:24:57,576
Sit down.

292
00:24:57,817 --> 00:24:58,932
Are you by yourself?

293
00:24:59,177 --> 00:25:00,530
You too, Liang?

294
00:25:03,097 --> 00:25:05,531
We have lots of nightclubs in China.

295
00:25:06,217 --> 00:25:09,050
They're all protected
by local gang bosses.

296
00:25:11,097 --> 00:25:13,008
Influential people.

297
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:18,726
Your goods can move around
our network easily.

298
00:25:20,617 --> 00:25:23,131
We have businesses in 11 cities.

299
00:25:27,257 --> 00:25:28,167
Excuse me.

300
00:25:30,817 --> 00:25:33,775
- Hello?
- Well, how's the talk so far?

301
00:25:34,017 --> 00:25:34,972
Not bad.

302
00:25:36,817 --> 00:25:38,535
See the ashtray in front of you?

303
00:25:39,777 --> 00:25:42,245
Pick it up and smash him with it.

304
00:25:49,617 --> 00:25:50,606
Hit him!

305
00:25:51,297 --> 00:25:53,208
Hit him in the head!

306
00:26:45,897 --> 00:26:47,410
I'm screwed.

307
00:26:47,657 --> 00:26:49,773
- What is it?
- Mary's pregnant.

308
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:53,491
- Congratulations.
- But we're not married yet.

309
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,807
- Get married then.
- Is that necessary?

310
00:26:56,057 --> 00:26:58,855
- Or she can have an abortion.
- We're already engaged.

311
00:26:59,097 --> 00:27:00,325
Hello?

312
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,726
Got it.

313
00:27:01,977 --> 00:27:03,535
- We can go.
- Let's go.

314
00:27:08,057 --> 00:27:09,888
Long time no see, Wong.

315
00:27:10,137 --> 00:27:13,095
But I saw you last week
with a girl in China.

316
00:27:13,337 --> 00:27:14,895
You don't have to shout.

317
00:27:15,137 --> 00:27:17,367
Security people are full of secrets.

318
00:27:20,337 --> 00:27:21,326
Stop for a minute.

319
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:39,135
Hey, what's going on?

320
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:41,169
What are you doing here?

321
00:27:46,777 --> 00:27:49,689
Hey! What's going on?
What are you doing?

322
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:58,292
Sorry, sir.

323
00:27:58,537 --> 00:28:02,291
We were asked to take some mugshots.
I don't know what's going on either.

324
00:28:03,097 --> 00:28:04,928
I asked CIB to open a file

325
00:28:05,937 --> 00:28:08,053
and take a picture of everyone.

326
00:28:09,017 --> 00:28:09,927
Is that alright?

327
00:28:12,977 --> 00:28:15,810
Officers, are you done?

328
00:28:17,617 --> 00:28:18,732
Everybody's here.

329
00:28:25,657 --> 00:28:27,932
We were investigating Mr Shen...

330
00:28:29,337 --> 00:28:32,374
...but we ended up
being led to Sam by chance.

331
00:28:33,137 --> 00:28:34,536
We even arrested Sam's men.

332
00:28:35,417 --> 00:28:37,487
I'll let CIB handle the triads.

333
00:28:37,737 --> 00:28:39,375
Sam, long time no see. Are you OK?

334
00:28:40,377 --> 00:28:44,165
- What brings you here?
- I'm accompanying some friends.

335
00:28:46,657 --> 00:28:49,171
You Hong Kong Police
are so inefficient.

336
00:28:50,417 --> 00:28:51,816
I'll speed it up then.

337
00:28:52,817 --> 00:28:54,887
He beat you up.

338
00:28:55,137 --> 00:28:56,616
Do you want to press charges?

339
00:28:56,897 --> 00:28:58,888
If not, then please sign here.

340
00:29:29,897 --> 00:29:31,649
I hit you. Want to press charges?

341
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,052
You're crazy.

342
00:29:36,497 --> 00:29:38,533
Keung, let's go.

343
00:29:39,417 --> 00:29:40,327
Wait.

344
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:55,935
Do you recognise me?

345
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:02,336
I recognise you. Be careful.

346
00:30:07,217 --> 00:30:08,775
Wong.

347
00:30:09,577 --> 00:30:11,886
It's up to you what you do with them.

348
00:30:16,617 --> 00:30:18,209
It's OK. We all know each other.

349
00:30:31,057 --> 00:30:33,287
CIB colleagues, you can go now.

350
00:30:33,537 --> 00:30:35,050
Thanks, Ming. Thank you.

351
00:30:35,297 --> 00:30:36,696
Just doing my job.

352
00:30:36,937 --> 00:30:38,290
Let's go.

353
00:30:43,257 --> 00:30:44,212
What's your game?

354
00:30:45,857 --> 00:30:48,451
You think I'm playing?
It's life and death.

355
00:30:48,737 --> 00:30:49,806
I'm glad you know that.

356
00:31:07,217 --> 00:31:08,491
Hurry up and thank me.

357
00:31:08,737 --> 00:31:10,011
Thank you for what?

358
00:31:10,257 --> 00:31:12,725
- Look what you're doing.
- Eating.

359
00:31:12,977 --> 00:31:14,615
You're eating shark fin.

360
00:31:14,857 --> 00:31:16,495
Shark fin, think about it.

361
00:31:16,737 --> 00:31:20,446
When Sam took me to Thailand,
I had shark fin and then I moved up.

362
00:31:21,217 --> 00:31:23,685
You're having shark fin
so you're moving up.

363
00:31:23,937 --> 00:31:26,929
Sam's mean,
but he still bought you shark fin.

364
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,405
Just think about it.

365
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:46,607
Take him.

366
00:31:48,937 --> 00:31:49,926
Let go of him.

367
00:31:54,777 --> 00:31:55,812
Sam,

368
00:31:56,857 --> 00:31:58,973
are you letting them
take Yan to China?

369
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:01,969
Ask him why he smashed his head.

370
00:32:07,257 --> 00:32:08,929
He smashed his head?

371
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,087
That's nothing.

372
00:32:10,337 --> 00:32:12,897
In this job,
either you get them or they get you.

373
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:17,566
Yan smashed his head, right?
How about this?

374
00:32:20,657 --> 00:32:22,170
Is that alright now?

375
00:32:31,057 --> 00:32:31,967
Liang.

376
00:32:36,897 --> 00:32:39,411
Are you here to make a scene...

377
00:32:40,657 --> 00:32:42,807
...or are you here for business?

378
00:32:48,697 --> 00:32:49,607
Go.

379
00:32:50,617 --> 00:32:51,527
Go!

380
00:32:58,217 --> 00:32:59,445
We're even now.

381
00:33:00,337 --> 00:33:01,816
Let's talk business.

382
00:33:05,177 --> 00:33:07,054
I heard
you have a big arms business.

383
00:33:07,337 --> 00:33:09,373
If you let me chip in...

384
00:33:11,977 --> 00:33:14,855
...the blood they have spilt
will not be in vain.

385
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:29,532
Sam.

386
00:33:37,657 --> 00:33:38,646
So?

387
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:41,291
You're not happy with me?

388
00:33:42,657 --> 00:33:43,567
No.

389
00:33:47,737 --> 00:33:49,170
Have you ever met someone...

390
00:33:50,577 --> 00:33:51,930
...who seems nice...

391
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,454
...but who might kill you at any time?

392
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:00,850
I've met someone like that.

393
00:34:05,297 --> 00:34:06,650
What do you think, Sam?

394
00:34:10,177 --> 00:34:11,496
I'm wondering...

395
00:34:13,257 --> 00:34:14,485
...why he didn't kill you.

396
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:21,610
You'll look after
the Mainland business from now on.

397
00:34:24,537 --> 00:34:26,095
Take this for now.

398
00:34:42,617 --> 00:34:43,936
Shen's not what he seems.

399
00:34:44,177 --> 00:34:45,815
Security is investigating him.

400
00:34:46,777 --> 00:34:48,927
He could be smuggling arms.

401
00:34:49,177 --> 00:34:51,088
Sam stopped all his deals in China.

402
00:34:51,337 --> 00:34:53,214
They're going to work together soon.

403
00:34:53,457 --> 00:34:54,970
That's a big deal.

404
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:58,450
What should I do?

405
00:34:59,177 --> 00:35:00,405
Have you seen the shrink?

406
00:35:01,217 --> 00:35:03,128
Why should I see a shrink?

407
00:35:03,377 --> 00:35:06,574
I persuaded the Department
of Justice not to send you to prison.

408
00:35:06,817 --> 00:35:11,174
It's fine if you don't want to go.
See you in prison. Bye.

409
00:35:12,337 --> 00:35:14,692
Hello? Hello? What's the address?

410
00:35:16,297 --> 00:35:17,207
Bye.

411
00:35:18,857 --> 00:35:20,370
I'm meeting with Dr Lee.

412
00:35:20,617 --> 00:35:21,527
This way.

413
00:36:32,137 --> 00:36:34,856
Are you planning
to spend the night here?

414
00:36:39,577 --> 00:36:41,374
I can't fall asleep in my office.

415
00:36:45,697 --> 00:36:46,686
Unlike him.

416
00:37:00,537 --> 00:37:02,095
He said...

417
00:37:03,697 --> 00:37:05,335
...ever since he became a mole...

418
00:37:09,017 --> 00:37:11,212
...he could only fall asleep here.

419
00:37:23,777 --> 00:37:24,892
I still remember...

420
00:37:27,697 --> 00:37:28,652
That night...

421
00:37:31,977 --> 00:37:34,411
He said everything
would be OK after tomorrow.

422
00:37:38,937 --> 00:37:40,689
And then he died.

423
00:38:00,617 --> 00:38:01,766
You're a doctor.

424
00:38:09,617 --> 00:38:12,450
Do you still have his file?

425
00:38:14,977 --> 00:38:18,174
He may be dead,
but he's still a patient.

426
00:38:23,737 --> 00:38:24,852
- Let's go.
- OK.

427
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:39,855
THREE HOURS LATER

428
00:39:31,257 --> 00:39:35,011
We found a letter on Sergeant Chun's
desk. There was a tape inside.

429
00:39:35,257 --> 00:39:38,135
It was a conversation
between him and Sam.

430
00:39:38,777 --> 00:39:40,495
The bosses say, after Sam's death,

431
00:39:40,777 --> 00:39:43,575
one of the moles is killing
the others to keep his cover.

432
00:39:44,577 --> 00:39:46,533
He's connected to Chun's death.

433
00:39:47,377 --> 00:39:49,447
I think Yeung could be the mole.

434
00:42:00,337 --> 00:42:02,567
Do you understand what I said?

435
00:42:02,817 --> 00:42:03,727
Sorry.

436
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:08,372
I won't sign it
if she doesn't come and meet me.

437
00:42:08,617 --> 00:42:09,572
Do you understand?

438
00:42:10,577 --> 00:42:11,487
OK.

439
00:42:27,697 --> 00:42:29,653
My wife and I
may be getting divorced.

440
00:42:31,217 --> 00:42:32,252
Did I scare you?

441
00:42:33,297 --> 00:42:34,207
Sorry.

442
00:42:35,017 --> 00:42:35,927
Be careful.

443
00:42:36,217 --> 00:42:37,252
Of what?

444
00:42:38,777 --> 00:42:41,610
Your car's next to mine.
I drive badly.

445
00:42:41,857 --> 00:42:44,291
If I scratch your car,
come and find me.

446
00:42:48,897 --> 00:42:51,252
I'm a good driver.
You don't have to worry.

447
00:43:37,937 --> 00:43:40,974
The Taiwanese we arrested
will be discharged next week.

448
00:43:41,217 --> 00:43:43,287
The Taiwan authorities
have no comment.

449
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:46,256
The Mainland police
will come for extradition.

450
00:43:46,497 --> 00:43:48,135
I know their boss well.

451
00:43:48,377 --> 00:43:50,686
Stick to the plan and be careful.

452
00:43:50,937 --> 00:43:52,336
When they arrive,

453
00:43:52,577 --> 00:43:56,013
make them feel welcome and take
them out for dinner and shopping.

454
00:43:56,657 --> 00:43:58,454
How about a nightclub?

455
00:43:58,697 --> 00:44:00,016
Macau is better.

456
00:44:00,257 --> 00:44:02,088
You're not afraid of reporters?

457
00:44:02,337 --> 00:44:04,726
We can cover their heads with bags.

458
00:44:04,977 --> 00:44:07,696
- OK, you bring the bags.
- What are you like?

459
00:44:08,777 --> 00:44:10,176
Superintendent Yeung.

460
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:12,885
It's Sergeant Chun's memorial
next week.

461
00:44:13,137 --> 00:44:15,173
We're all chipping in for a service.

462
00:44:31,537 --> 00:44:33,209
- Do it properly.
- Yes, sir.

463
00:44:33,457 --> 00:44:36,654
Back to the Mainland police.
Talk to the Macau guys tomorrow.

464
00:44:36,897 --> 00:44:40,685
Let them plan the evening.
I'll talk to them about security.

465
00:44:41,337 --> 00:44:44,568
If we don't plan, it'll be a mess.
Then we won't have a good time.

466
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:49,448
Anything to add to your testimony?

467
00:49:51,137 --> 00:49:52,047
No.

468
00:49:53,017 --> 00:49:55,406
Call us any time
if you need anything.

469
00:49:55,977 --> 00:49:57,012
Thank you.

470
00:49:58,457 --> 00:49:59,810
- Are you done?
- Yes.

471
00:50:02,337 --> 00:50:04,692
- Is it OK if I touch things?
- Yes.

472
00:50:04,937 --> 00:50:06,006
OK, thank you.

473
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,134
Is everything OK?

474
00:50:13,337 --> 00:50:14,895
It was like this when I came in.

475
00:50:16,697 --> 00:50:19,609
They stole some cash and watches.

476
00:50:20,897 --> 00:50:22,330
And the computer's gone.

477
00:50:25,297 --> 00:50:28,972
It's better this way.
I can start from scratch.

478
00:50:32,617 --> 00:50:34,414
But the computer's useless to them.

479
00:50:36,977 --> 00:50:38,729
I locked it with my password.

480
00:50:39,457 --> 00:50:42,051
They won't know
it's my licence plate number.

481
00:50:51,177 --> 00:50:53,532
Your eyes are all red.

482
00:50:54,297 --> 00:50:55,776
You haven't slept?

483
00:50:57,497 --> 00:51:00,011
I've been
following several cases for days.

484
00:51:01,377 --> 00:51:02,696
You should get some sleep.

485
00:51:08,057 --> 00:51:10,730
OK.
Everything will be OK after tomorrow.

486
00:51:12,417 --> 00:51:14,533
I'm off.
Call me if you need anything.

487
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:01,327
Mr Chan.

488
00:52:02,657 --> 00:52:07,526
AUGUST 16TH 2002
THE FIRST SESSION

489
00:52:10,017 --> 00:52:12,372
Mr Chan, I'm Dr Lee.

490
00:52:12,617 --> 00:52:17,247
I'm obligated to tell you that you've
been ordered to undergo treatment.

491
00:52:18,137 --> 00:52:20,970
You should complete the treatment
in six months.

492
00:52:22,257 --> 00:52:25,135
After that,
I'll submit a report to the Court.

493
00:52:26,617 --> 00:52:29,370
The Court will use that
to decide if you should go to prison.

494
00:52:32,897 --> 00:52:33,807
Prison?

495
00:52:35,097 --> 00:52:36,530
Isn't the treatment enough?

496
00:52:37,217 --> 00:52:40,095
You must follow
doctor's orders during this time

497
00:52:40,337 --> 00:52:43,249
or the Court can revoke the sentence

498
00:52:43,497 --> 00:52:46,011
and detain you for handling.

499
00:52:46,257 --> 00:52:47,246
I see.

500
00:52:50,497 --> 00:52:51,896
Excuse me.

501
00:52:56,457 --> 00:52:58,095
Wong, you git.

502
00:53:01,577 --> 00:53:04,728
Dr Lee, you don't need
to call the police. Just call me.

503
00:53:04,977 --> 00:53:06,296
You have my mobile number.

504
00:53:11,657 --> 00:53:13,329
I'll become a wanted criminal.

505
00:53:13,577 --> 00:53:16,774
THE SECOND SESSION

506
00:53:22,577 --> 00:53:24,807
Mr Chan, I'm Dr Lee.

507
00:53:25,057 --> 00:53:29,175
I'm obligated to tell you that you've
been ordered to undergo treatment.

508
00:53:29,417 --> 00:53:32,136
You should complete the treatment
in six months.

509
00:53:32,377 --> 00:53:34,288
You'll submit a report to the Court.

510
00:53:34,537 --> 00:53:38,246
They'll use this report and they
might put me in prison. I get it.

511
00:53:39,217 --> 00:53:40,809
Please sign here then.

512
00:53:44,657 --> 00:53:46,773
We think you have a violent streak

513
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,446
so we'll use hypnotism
for your treatment.

514
00:53:49,737 --> 00:53:50,453
Hypnotism?

515
00:53:52,377 --> 00:53:53,366
You signed the form.

516
00:53:54,057 --> 00:53:54,967
Hypnotism?

517
00:53:58,137 --> 00:53:59,490
You can refuse it

518
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:01,455
but the Court can revoke it.

519
00:54:01,737 --> 00:54:03,170
And lock me up?

520
00:54:09,057 --> 00:54:10,172
Alright, then.

521
00:54:11,897 --> 00:54:12,807
Hypnotize me.

522
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:14,970
Hypnotize me now.

523
00:54:16,897 --> 00:54:17,966
Let's begin.

524
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:21,049
Please introduce yourself.

525
00:54:21,297 --> 00:54:22,810
Talk about your family.

526
00:54:27,177 --> 00:54:28,087
Mr Chan?

527
00:54:29,217 --> 00:54:30,127
Mr Chan.

528
00:54:32,057 --> 00:54:33,172
Can you cooperate?

529
00:54:33,817 --> 00:54:36,775
I was practising just in case
you couldn't hypnotize me.

530
00:54:37,017 --> 00:54:38,848
I can hypnotize myself for you.

531
00:54:40,017 --> 00:54:41,928
My will is really strong, you know.

532
00:54:42,177 --> 00:54:43,735
It's not easy to hypnotize me.

533
00:54:45,817 --> 00:54:47,045
I haven't started yet.

534
00:54:51,537 --> 00:54:52,606
Not yet.

535
00:55:01,857 --> 00:55:03,085
You want to know my story?

536
00:55:05,337 --> 00:55:06,850
My surname isn't really Chan.

537
00:55:07,897 --> 00:55:09,330
I was an illegitimate child.

538
00:55:11,297 --> 00:55:12,616
My dad sold drugs.

539
00:55:14,297 --> 00:55:16,174
I've been working since I was little.

540
00:55:17,937 --> 00:55:19,575
I earned HK$200,000 a month.

541
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:21,250
I brought a Porsche at 17.

542
00:55:21,497 --> 00:55:23,852
I didn't have a licence
so I hired two drivers.

543
00:55:24,137 --> 00:55:27,129
This psychiatry thing is pointless.

544
00:55:29,657 --> 00:55:31,454
It's either the shrink or prison.

545
00:55:33,777 --> 00:55:35,813
She wants to hypnotize me.

546
00:55:36,057 --> 00:55:39,208
If I end up revealing everything,
don't blame me.

547
00:55:39,897 --> 00:55:43,412
It's not that easy. She can't do it
if you don't concentrate.

548
00:55:44,857 --> 00:55:46,415
It's tough not to concentrate.

549
00:55:47,537 --> 00:55:48,731
Dr Lee is a nice...

550
00:55:53,457 --> 00:55:54,492
...person.

551
00:55:55,217 --> 00:55:56,536
You wouldn't understand.

552
00:56:06,977 --> 00:56:08,171
THE THIRD SESSION

553
00:56:08,417 --> 00:56:11,853
You're looking at the sky.
There are lots of clouds.

554
00:56:13,377 --> 00:56:14,776
You're in the water.

555
00:56:15,297 --> 00:56:17,288
Your body
is wrapped by the warm water.

556
00:56:19,337 --> 00:56:22,010
You feel a sense of weightlessness.

557
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:25,015
You're floating on the water.

558
00:56:27,497 --> 00:56:28,771
Slowly open your eyes.

559
00:56:30,377 --> 00:56:31,651
The sky is close to you.

560
00:56:34,697 --> 00:56:35,607
Then...

561
00:56:42,017 --> 00:56:43,416
What are you doing?

562
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:46,846
I'm hungry.

563
00:56:47,817 --> 00:56:49,569
My stomach will hurt if I don't eat.

564
00:56:55,017 --> 00:56:56,894
- Are you finished?
- Yes.

565
00:56:57,137 --> 00:56:58,206
Let's start.

566
00:57:03,057 --> 00:57:04,536
Can you see the sea?

567
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:10,608
You're in the water.
The water is really warm.

568
00:57:11,497 --> 00:57:13,453
It has wrapped round your whole body.

569
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:17,609
Next, you feel
a sense of weightlessness.

570
00:57:27,417 --> 00:57:29,294
You have a lot of tricks.

571
00:57:30,737 --> 00:57:31,772
Not really.

572
00:57:32,017 --> 00:57:34,815
I'm afraid of oversleeping
during the hypnosis.

573
00:57:35,057 --> 00:57:36,934
It's best to set an alarm.

574
00:57:43,257 --> 00:57:44,895
It's not hard to remember.

575
00:57:45,137 --> 00:57:47,367
A Mercedes to Zhanjiang.
A Land Cruiser...

576
00:57:47,617 --> 00:57:48,845
THE FOURTH SESSION

577
00:57:49,537 --> 00:57:51,414
Write it down if you can't remember!

578
00:57:53,337 --> 00:57:56,852
The speedboats
definitely need new motors.

579
00:57:57,137 --> 00:57:58,490
Pink?

580
00:57:58,737 --> 00:58:00,409
We're smuggling, not sailing.

581
00:58:01,137 --> 00:58:03,935
My fax number is 21918125.

582
00:58:05,337 --> 00:58:06,247
No fax machine?

583
00:58:06,537 --> 00:58:08,209
Why did you ask for my fax number?

584
00:58:09,657 --> 00:58:10,567
E-mail?

585
00:58:12,177 --> 00:58:13,087
E-mail address?

586
00:58:15,537 --> 00:58:16,526
No e-mail.

587
00:58:22,577 --> 00:58:24,613
Sorry, I've been really busy.

588
00:58:25,537 --> 00:58:27,448
So are you done with your business?

589
00:58:27,697 --> 00:58:29,210
Let's talk about your family.

590
00:58:30,857 --> 00:58:32,575
You said your dad had three wives.

591
00:58:32,817 --> 00:58:34,170
You have 16 sisters.

592
00:58:34,417 --> 00:58:36,408
Let's talk about your twelfth sister.

593
00:58:44,017 --> 00:58:45,132
I haven't...

594
00:58:50,617 --> 00:58:51,732
Are you OK?

595
00:58:51,977 --> 00:58:53,569
- Go away.
- What's wrong?

596
00:58:53,817 --> 00:58:55,011
I haven't answered it.

597
00:58:59,697 --> 00:59:00,652
Better now?

598
00:59:06,777 --> 00:59:10,816
The report for the Court
isn't important to me.

599
00:59:13,457 --> 00:59:14,367
I'm a doctor.

600
00:59:15,417 --> 00:59:16,691
I only want to cure you.

601
00:59:19,057 --> 00:59:21,571
If you don't want that,
you can leave at any time.

602
00:59:32,737 --> 00:59:34,853
I've been wanting
to tell you something.

603
00:59:38,377 --> 00:59:41,574
If you keep lying, I can't help you.

604
01:00:01,777 --> 01:00:07,090
THE... SESSION

605
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:29,887
Dr Lee.

606
01:01:31,537 --> 01:01:33,732
Did I do anything else besides sleep?

607
01:01:35,657 --> 01:01:37,807
You don't remember what you've done?

608
01:01:40,577 --> 01:01:42,374
I do remember, but I'm not sure.

609
01:01:43,417 --> 01:01:45,009
Forget it. Bye.

610
01:01:55,737 --> 01:01:56,726
Dr Lee.

611
01:01:59,977 --> 01:02:01,888
I think you're especially nice to me.

612
01:02:02,497 --> 01:02:04,488
- Do you fancy me?
- You're delusional.

613
01:02:06,297 --> 01:02:07,286
Delusional?

614
01:02:11,577 --> 01:02:12,851
No wonder.

615
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:15,807
Bye.

616
01:02:27,337 --> 01:02:30,568
What are you smiling about?
Did she say you'll die tomorrow?

617
01:02:31,577 --> 01:02:32,896
You wouldn't understand.

618
01:02:33,777 --> 01:02:35,654
You think I'm delusional?

619
01:02:35,937 --> 01:02:36,847
Delusional?

620
01:02:37,697 --> 01:02:38,607
You are.

621
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:42,289
Maybe all the hypnotism
has made me delusional.

622
01:02:43,377 --> 01:02:44,287
That's...

623
01:02:44,537 --> 01:02:47,005
- Hey, watch the road!
- So many cars.

624
01:02:47,737 --> 01:02:51,696
They find a woman to mess with your
head so you'll pour your heart out.

625
01:02:53,177 --> 01:02:55,611
It's not her,
it all to do with Freud.

626
01:02:56,577 --> 01:02:58,135
According to psychoanalysis,

627
01:02:58,377 --> 01:03:00,686
hypnosis can get
to your subconscious.

628
01:03:00,937 --> 01:03:04,054
From there,
it can reach your darker side.

629
01:03:05,497 --> 01:03:08,694
After reaching that side,
your traumas can be treated.

630
01:03:08,937 --> 01:03:10,575
There'll be symbolic memories.

631
01:03:10,817 --> 01:03:12,136
That's really deep.

632
01:03:12,657 --> 01:03:16,696
I can't help it. It was written
in the book that Shen gave me.

633
01:03:17,617 --> 01:03:18,936
Are you friends with Shen?

634
01:03:19,177 --> 01:03:21,691
No way. He's the one clinging to me.

635
01:03:47,617 --> 01:03:48,527
Mr Shen.

636
01:03:49,457 --> 01:03:51,254
Mr Shen. Let me apologise for Yan.

637
01:03:51,497 --> 01:03:53,089
I'll apologise for him.

638
01:03:58,977 --> 01:04:02,014
Have you ever heard the saying,

639
01:04:02,257 --> 01:04:05,488
"Men are changed by events,
not events by men?"

640
01:04:09,577 --> 01:04:13,092
There's no present without the past.

641
01:04:14,457 --> 01:04:15,367
Thank you.

642
01:04:15,657 --> 01:04:16,612
What?

643
01:04:17,537 --> 01:04:18,447
Good speech.

644
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:22,167
Where's Sam?

645
01:04:22,417 --> 01:04:24,612
He sent the two of us.

646
01:05:14,057 --> 01:05:14,967
Sam.

647
01:05:17,457 --> 01:05:18,492
Are you reading?

648
01:05:19,297 --> 01:05:20,525
Any recommendations?

649
01:05:20,777 --> 01:05:21,687
And you?

650
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:25,845
How To Get Rich in One Day.
It's good.

651
01:05:26,097 --> 01:05:27,371
I don't need the money.

652
01:05:30,097 --> 01:05:32,895
I've helped you these last few years.

653
01:05:34,977 --> 01:05:36,171
You should speak first.

654
01:05:39,897 --> 01:05:42,457
You already know everything
that I know.

655
01:05:46,617 --> 01:05:48,016
Let's cut the crap.

656
01:05:49,257 --> 01:05:50,292
Will you help me?

657
01:05:51,977 --> 01:05:54,969
You help me, I help you.
We'll help each other.

658
01:05:55,737 --> 01:05:57,170
Good.

659
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:01,776
What are you doing here?

660
01:06:02,337 --> 01:06:04,487
Me? I'm here...

661
01:07:00,017 --> 01:07:01,166
He's gone.

662
01:07:07,657 --> 01:07:08,567
Who is he?

663
01:07:10,817 --> 01:07:11,727
A pimp.

664
01:07:13,297 --> 01:07:14,525
Why were you tailing him?

665
01:07:16,457 --> 01:07:18,971
I'm a pimp too.
I want to know if he stole my girls.

666
01:07:21,577 --> 01:07:23,727
Actually, I could do with some money.

667
01:07:24,697 --> 01:07:27,370
If you don't mind,
how about hiring me?

668
01:07:31,057 --> 01:07:32,331
Be serious, Dr Lee.

669
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:34,849
Be serious, pimp.

670
01:08:04,337 --> 01:08:06,328
Hello, Internal Affairs.

671
01:08:06,577 --> 01:08:09,455
Boss, I saw Yeung with Sam today.

672
01:08:10,137 --> 01:08:12,651
Yeung may be a mole.
Run a check on him.

673
01:08:13,737 --> 01:08:16,456
Sam's deal with Shen
should start soon.

674
01:08:20,577 --> 01:08:21,487
Hello?

675
01:09:06,497 --> 01:09:08,135
Uncle Chan, you're here so late.

676
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:10,095
I'm changing the water.

677
01:09:11,297 --> 01:09:13,174
You're quite something, Uncle Chan.

678
01:09:13,457 --> 01:09:15,573
You know exactly
when we run out of water.

679
01:09:15,817 --> 01:09:18,570
Don'tjust talk, give me a hand.

680
01:09:20,017 --> 01:09:21,370
Damon, help him.

681
01:09:24,377 --> 01:09:26,607
Let me, Uncle Chan. Let me.

682
01:09:54,537 --> 01:09:55,447
Hello?

683
01:09:55,697 --> 01:09:57,255
Why didn't you speakjust then?

684
01:09:58,497 --> 01:09:59,850
Yan sent me a tape.

685
01:10:03,457 --> 01:10:05,573
Chan Wing Yan sent you a tape?

686
01:10:11,577 --> 01:10:12,566
Wait for me.

687
01:10:16,457 --> 01:10:18,607
Hey! What's the matter with you?

688
01:10:18,857 --> 01:10:20,336
- I'm busy.
- Wait.

689
01:10:20,577 --> 01:10:21,612
What is it?

690
01:10:22,537 --> 01:10:24,368
You've been back for two days.

691
01:10:24,617 --> 01:10:27,177
You haven't seen anybody else but me.

692
01:10:28,257 --> 01:10:30,134
Am I supposed to greet everyone?

693
01:10:31,537 --> 01:10:32,447
Hey!

694
01:10:42,457 --> 01:10:43,412
Did I scare you?

695
01:10:44,537 --> 01:10:45,447
Sorry.

696
01:10:46,737 --> 01:10:47,726
Sorry.

697
01:10:56,057 --> 01:10:58,935
I don't know why you've
locked yourself up for two days.

698
01:10:59,177 --> 01:11:02,328
Whatever it is,
don't take everything on yourself.

699
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:10,608
Everything will be OK after tomorrow.

700
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:15,847
Lau.

701
01:11:22,537 --> 01:11:23,731
The door is over there.

702
01:11:50,577 --> 01:11:55,935
PO BOX 27149
CHAN WING YIN

703
01:11:57,497 --> 01:11:58,566
Let's give it to OCTB.

704
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:10,176
Have you listened to it?

705
01:12:11,777 --> 01:12:12,687
No.

706
01:12:38,297 --> 01:12:40,492
Sam and Shen's transaction
is in two days.

707
01:12:40,737 --> 01:12:42,534
There'll be lots of arms and coke.

708
01:12:42,777 --> 01:12:44,688
I'll contact you before it starts.

709
01:12:44,937 --> 01:12:47,053
So Sam doesn't
completely trust you yet.

710
01:12:48,937 --> 01:12:50,131
Beware of Yeung.

711
01:12:50,857 --> 01:12:51,767
I will.

712
01:12:52,377 --> 01:12:53,776
Can you arrest him?

713
01:12:54,497 --> 01:12:55,691
You saw them together.

714
01:12:55,937 --> 01:12:58,007
That's not enough.
How can I arrest him?

715
01:12:59,257 --> 01:13:01,009
Boss, I'm risking my life for you.

716
01:13:01,257 --> 01:13:02,610
Don't tell me that.

717
01:13:03,337 --> 01:13:05,328
I'll take care of Yeung.

718
01:13:10,857 --> 01:13:11,767
You?

719
01:13:13,137 --> 01:13:14,934
Don't worry. Lau's a great help.

720
01:13:15,217 --> 01:13:18,209
What are you saying?
It's his fault that you die.

721
01:13:20,017 --> 01:13:21,336
It was an accident.

722
01:13:22,097 --> 01:13:23,212
Don't you want us dead?

723
01:13:23,497 --> 01:13:25,965
I just want to be a good man.

724
01:13:30,457 --> 01:13:31,856
Give me another chance?

725
01:13:36,297 --> 01:13:39,016
Sorry, I'm a cop.

726
01:14:38,537 --> 01:14:39,856
Are you OK?

727
01:14:42,417 --> 01:14:43,327
I'm OK.

728
01:14:45,057 --> 01:14:45,967
I'm OK.

729
01:15:05,457 --> 01:15:07,129
Do you know what you were doing?

730
01:15:07,817 --> 01:15:09,250
I know. So what?

731
01:15:13,297 --> 01:15:16,130
- Can you take me back to my office?
- Of course.

732
01:15:16,377 --> 01:15:18,686
Are you OK? Come on, let's go.

733
01:16:09,137 --> 01:16:10,047
Good morning.

734
01:16:18,577 --> 01:16:21,296
Your hypnotherapy is really good.

735
01:16:22,097 --> 01:16:23,291
I'm all relaxed.

736
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:28,012
I've made some progress so I guess
I won't need to go to prison.

737
01:16:33,697 --> 01:16:37,656
We need to work together
in hypnotherapy.

738
01:16:39,657 --> 01:16:41,295
If you don't tell the truth...

739
01:16:42,537 --> 01:16:44,016
...no one can help you.

740
01:16:44,257 --> 01:16:45,929
I'm already very cooperative.

741
01:16:47,977 --> 01:16:50,696
It's OK if you don't
want to talk about the triads...

742
01:16:51,897 --> 01:16:53,171
...but when we're chatting,

743
01:16:53,417 --> 01:16:57,569
you still lie about what films
you like and what you like to eat.

744
01:17:01,057 --> 01:17:02,285
I don't understand.

745
01:17:04,217 --> 01:17:06,412
You're not me.
You wouldn't understand.

746
01:17:16,657 --> 01:17:20,286
God didn't mean
for our minds to keep secrets.

747
01:17:22,417 --> 01:17:24,612
I remember when I was a child...

748
01:17:25,617 --> 01:17:27,972
...I stole some chocolate
from a supermarket.

749
01:17:29,137 --> 01:17:32,254
A family-sized bar. A foot long.

750
01:17:33,537 --> 01:17:36,813
When I got to the till,
the manager caught me.

751
01:17:37,977 --> 01:17:40,650
I was scared and I just cried.

752
01:17:42,217 --> 01:17:43,491
The manager let me go.

753
01:17:45,217 --> 01:17:48,527
Later, I went to the supermarket
with my mum.

754
01:17:48,777 --> 01:17:50,290
I saw the manager again.

755
01:17:51,657 --> 01:17:54,296
I just felt him staring at me.

756
01:17:54,537 --> 01:17:55,765
I felt uneasy.

757
01:17:56,897 --> 01:17:59,331
My mum asked me what was wrong.

758
01:18:00,337 --> 01:18:02,089
I said the manager had molested me.

759
01:18:02,777 --> 01:18:04,005
My mum called the police.

760
01:18:04,257 --> 01:18:06,566
The police took the manager away.

761
01:18:07,337 --> 01:18:10,056
That manager never told on me.

762
01:18:11,977 --> 01:18:14,855
I never saw him again.

763
01:18:16,937 --> 01:18:18,336
When I went to university,

764
01:18:19,257 --> 01:18:21,009
I finally told this to a classmate.

765
01:18:24,697 --> 01:18:25,925
After I told the story,

766
01:18:27,137 --> 01:18:30,812
I felt like I had been reborn.

767
01:18:34,457 --> 01:18:36,175
Can I really start over again?

768
01:18:38,737 --> 01:18:39,931
Do you trust me?

769
01:18:42,577 --> 01:18:43,566
I do.

770
01:18:43,817 --> 01:18:44,932
I do.

771
01:18:46,697 --> 01:18:48,210
It'll be OK if you trust me.

772
01:18:50,337 --> 01:18:52,407
When did you join the triads?

773
01:18:53,617 --> 01:18:55,289
I didn't want to be in the triads.

774
01:18:58,057 --> 01:18:59,206
I want to be a good man.

775
01:19:01,617 --> 01:19:02,652
But...

776
01:19:04,857 --> 01:19:06,256
...I met Mary.

777
01:19:08,657 --> 01:19:09,726
Your wife?

778
01:19:12,537 --> 01:19:13,652
Sam's woman.

779
01:19:15,937 --> 01:19:17,450
Why am I saying this?

780
01:19:20,617 --> 01:19:23,575
You have to trust me
so I can hypnotize you.

781
01:19:23,817 --> 01:19:25,648
Then we can solve your problems.

782
01:19:28,897 --> 01:19:30,694
You can't solve my problems.

783
01:19:31,897 --> 01:19:33,888
My job
is to betray those close to me.

784
01:19:37,577 --> 01:19:39,215
I don't know when I can stop.

785
01:19:42,617 --> 01:19:43,845
I want to survive...

786
01:19:45,657 --> 01:19:47,648
...so I have
to betray those close to me.

787
01:19:49,937 --> 01:19:50,926
Actually, I'm a cop.

788
01:19:52,457 --> 01:19:53,367
I'm a cop.

789
01:20:01,257 --> 01:20:02,895
I don't want to be Sam's mole.

790
01:20:20,177 --> 01:20:21,326
Did I scare you?

791
01:20:23,697 --> 01:20:24,925
Sorry.

792
01:20:38,697 --> 01:20:41,370
Don't worry,
everything will be OK after tomorrow.

793
01:20:50,737 --> 01:20:52,932
Where were you?
The transaction's today.

794
01:20:53,217 --> 01:20:54,366
- Today?
- Yeah.

795
01:20:54,617 --> 01:20:55,686
I've been forgetful.

796
01:20:58,897 --> 01:20:59,852
Hand these out.

797
01:21:00,697 --> 01:21:01,686
Yan.

798
01:21:07,377 --> 01:21:08,776
You go in Shen's boat.

799
01:21:09,017 --> 01:21:11,008
Be careful. There are arms in there.

800
01:21:12,537 --> 01:21:13,970
If anything goes wrong...

801
01:21:14,217 --> 01:21:15,445
I know.

802
01:21:16,017 --> 01:21:17,848
You go with me to the dockyard.

803
01:21:26,217 --> 01:21:28,731
Shen and Sam's deal
is happening tonight.

804
01:21:28,977 --> 01:21:31,935
They might be heavily armed.
Wear bulletproof vests.

805
01:21:32,697 --> 01:21:34,415
The water police are standing by.

806
01:21:34,697 --> 01:21:36,767
Teams A and B,
get ready on the hill.

807
01:21:38,817 --> 01:21:40,011
Call the operation off.

808
01:21:41,497 --> 01:21:42,691
What are you saying?

809
01:21:43,377 --> 01:21:44,696
It's an order from the top.

810
01:21:51,297 --> 01:21:52,935
An order from the top or from you?

811
01:21:54,577 --> 01:21:55,771
I don't need to explain.

812
01:21:58,337 --> 01:22:01,568
I've been on Sam's trail for years.
What are your ties with him?

813
01:22:02,697 --> 01:22:04,415
This is Security's top secret.

814
01:22:04,657 --> 01:22:07,854
You can make a formal inquiry
to the Assistant Commissioner.

815
01:22:09,497 --> 01:22:11,374
- Call IA and check.
- Yes, sir.

816
01:22:21,697 --> 01:22:23,688
Just do what Yeung says.

817
01:22:23,937 --> 01:22:24,847
I won't.

818
01:22:25,097 --> 01:22:27,850
Wong,
this isn't as simple as you think.

819
01:22:28,097 --> 01:22:29,689
It's very simple for me, sir.

820
01:22:29,937 --> 01:22:31,734
My man is risking his life out there.

821
01:22:32,657 --> 01:22:36,650
Everybody in OCTB stays put. You're
under disciplinary investigation.

822
01:22:39,497 --> 01:22:40,930
What disciplinary issues?

823
01:22:41,817 --> 01:22:44,695
You don't follow orders.
That's a disciplinary issue.

824
01:22:51,497 --> 01:22:52,566
Where are you going?

825
01:22:54,177 --> 01:22:55,610
Back to my office, sir.

826
01:22:59,417 --> 01:23:00,896
You can go.

827
01:23:14,737 --> 01:23:16,295
- Tang.
- Yes.

828
01:23:16,537 --> 01:23:18,209
- Turn back.
- OK.

829
01:23:18,457 --> 01:23:20,095
Ask everyone to follow our car.

830
01:23:22,257 --> 01:23:25,567
Sam, Yan's doing the transaction.

831
01:24:43,457 --> 01:24:44,367
Hello?

832
01:24:44,617 --> 01:24:47,689
Your wife has agreed to meet you
this afternoon. Is that OK?

833
01:24:50,777 --> 01:24:52,369
Thank you. Thank you.

834
01:24:58,697 --> 01:25:01,655
The Mainlanders
will come in today for extradition.

835
01:25:01,897 --> 01:25:04,536
Make sure nothing goes wrong.
Be careful.

836
01:25:04,777 --> 01:25:07,655
- Damon and Fai, you stay here.
- OK.

837
01:25:08,177 --> 01:25:10,737
Set the channel to 34879. OK?

838
01:25:11,497 --> 01:25:13,886
- Tell Transportation we can go now.
- OK.

839
01:25:51,857 --> 01:25:52,767
Thank you.

840
01:27:17,097 --> 01:27:19,736
Inspector Lau,
are you having fun in my office?

841
01:28:36,817 --> 01:28:39,126
Everybody, get ready. Follow me.

842
01:28:41,017 --> 01:28:41,972
What's going on?

843
01:28:42,217 --> 01:28:44,094
We're having Yeung round for coffee.

844
01:28:47,817 --> 01:28:51,696
The Mainlanders are chatting inside.
They'll meet our boss in 15 minutes.

845
01:28:51,937 --> 01:28:53,416
Don't make any mistakes.

846
01:28:53,657 --> 01:28:55,727
Damon and Fai,
get the documents ready.

847
01:29:04,897 --> 01:29:05,966
Yeung Kam Wing.

848
01:29:06,937 --> 01:29:09,132
You're suspected
of conspiring with Sam.

849
01:29:09,377 --> 01:29:11,333
Please come back with us to IA.

850
01:29:13,657 --> 01:29:16,569
Inspector Lau,
do you know what you're doing?

851
01:29:16,857 --> 01:29:17,812
I know.

852
01:29:22,257 --> 01:29:23,326
I found a tape.

853
01:29:24,017 --> 01:29:25,814
What tape? I don't understand.

854
01:29:26,897 --> 01:29:28,296
Listen and you will.

855
01:29:54,737 --> 01:29:55,772
Where's Sam?

856
01:29:56,377 --> 01:29:57,571
Sam's not here yet?

857
01:30:18,377 --> 01:30:19,412
They're empty!

858
01:30:21,257 --> 01:30:22,167
Shen!

859
01:31:01,017 --> 01:31:03,451
The arms cost HK$10 million.
Give them back.

860
01:31:03,697 --> 01:31:05,335
Those Mainlanders are animals.

861
01:31:06,777 --> 01:31:09,496
- What if they're setting me up?
- Who told you that?

862
01:31:11,377 --> 01:31:12,776
My life told me so.

863
01:31:13,457 --> 01:31:14,731
What if you're wrong?

864
01:31:15,937 --> 01:31:18,167
Then I'll cooperate with them.

865
01:31:19,777 --> 01:31:21,733
But Yan's going to die either way?

866
01:31:23,337 --> 01:31:26,374
We're all risking our lives
in this business.

867
01:31:27,617 --> 01:31:29,050
I almost died twice.

868
01:31:29,897 --> 01:31:31,410
Sam, don't play games.

869
01:31:31,897 --> 01:31:33,125
Sam!

870
01:31:33,377 --> 01:31:35,447
I've only ever had one guy
work for me!

871
01:31:35,697 --> 01:31:37,653
How can you do this to me?

872
01:31:38,737 --> 01:31:40,170
What are you saying?

873
01:32:18,657 --> 01:32:19,646
Tell me.

874
01:32:21,777 --> 01:32:22,687
Tell me.

875
01:32:24,017 --> 01:32:25,211
Where are my goods?

876
01:32:25,857 --> 01:32:27,210
Where have you put them?

877
01:32:28,697 --> 01:32:30,016
Go and ask Sam yourself.

878
01:32:39,057 --> 01:32:42,652
Why didn't you shoot me in the head?

879
01:32:44,697 --> 01:32:45,607
I didn't aim.

880
01:32:45,897 --> 01:32:47,012
Stand up.

881
01:32:47,937 --> 01:32:49,211
Stand up!

882
01:33:00,337 --> 01:33:02,009
Are you two in this together?

883
01:33:05,057 --> 01:33:06,775
You two are in this together.

884
01:33:07,297 --> 01:33:09,253
Sorry, I'm a cop.

885
01:33:09,977 --> 01:33:11,251
Go ahead and shoot.

886
01:33:11,537 --> 01:33:13,095
It'll save me a bullet.

887
01:33:14,697 --> 01:33:17,052
What? Are you sure you're a cop?

888
01:33:17,857 --> 01:33:21,167
I am.
I got an "A" for writing reports.

889
01:33:21,937 --> 01:33:24,929
After I kill both of you,
I can write what I like.

890
01:33:42,337 --> 01:33:44,089
He's not really Sam's man.

891
01:33:53,337 --> 01:33:55,134
Then you're not really Shen.

892
01:34:11,097 --> 01:34:12,530
You're just in time.

893
01:34:13,537 --> 01:34:15,687
Listen with us. It's interesting.

894
01:34:22,377 --> 01:34:25,414
So you don't want to help me,
Inspector Lau?

895
01:34:25,657 --> 01:34:28,091
I do, but they're watching me.

896
01:34:28,337 --> 01:34:32,046
So you're not worried about me.
You're worried about yourself.

897
01:34:32,297 --> 01:34:33,650
Whatever you say.

898
01:34:35,417 --> 01:34:36,611
You deal with him.

899
01:34:38,177 --> 01:34:40,930
Give me three days.
I'll run a check and call you.

900
01:34:53,817 --> 01:34:54,772
Inspector Lau.

901
01:34:56,657 --> 01:35:00,366
Lau Kin Ming,
this is your last chance.

902
01:35:01,657 --> 01:35:02,931
Don't waste it.

903
01:35:09,977 --> 01:35:12,537
Lau Kin Ming, you're under arrest.

904
01:35:12,777 --> 01:35:16,247
Lau Kin Ming's over there! What are
you doing? What are you doing?

905
01:35:17,177 --> 01:35:20,249
We agreed to arrest him.
Why are you helping him?

906
01:35:20,497 --> 01:35:22,488
Yeung found this tape in your room.

907
01:35:22,737 --> 01:35:26,571
- What's the problem?
- That cop was following me.

908
01:35:27,417 --> 01:35:30,215
I'm in charge now.
Call me if you've got transactions.

909
01:35:30,457 --> 01:35:32,448
We got the goods
when we killed the cop.

910
01:35:33,217 --> 01:35:34,332
Cuff him.

911
01:35:35,097 --> 01:35:36,052
What are you doing?

912
01:35:36,337 --> 01:35:38,055
Move back! Sit down!

913
01:35:38,337 --> 01:35:39,770
Sit down! Move back!

914
01:35:40,057 --> 01:35:41,775
- Inspector Lau...
- Move back!

915
01:35:42,457 --> 01:35:43,685
Move back!

916
01:35:43,937 --> 01:35:45,006
What are you doing?

917
01:35:49,897 --> 01:35:51,125
I told you to be careful.

918
01:35:51,417 --> 01:35:52,611
Why should I be careful?

919
01:35:52,857 --> 01:35:55,417
Why? I'm a good man.
Why should I be careful?

920
01:35:55,697 --> 01:35:56,846
Why?

921
01:36:02,457 --> 01:36:03,731
I worked so hard.

922
01:36:05,497 --> 01:36:06,612
I helped you kill...

923
01:36:07,857 --> 01:36:09,051
...all of Sam's moles.

924
01:36:09,297 --> 01:36:13,688
Why can't you give me a chance?
Why can't you give me a chance?

925
01:36:13,937 --> 01:36:15,290
I only want to be a good man.

926
01:36:16,217 --> 01:36:17,536
I only want to be a good man.

927
01:36:18,457 --> 01:36:20,493
Why can't
you give me a chance? Why?

928
01:36:20,777 --> 01:36:22,608
Tell me!

929
01:36:23,777 --> 01:36:25,847
Sorry, I'm a cop.

930
01:36:32,977 --> 01:36:35,571
Sorry, I'm a cop.

931
01:36:37,177 --> 01:36:38,212
I'm a cop too!

932
01:37:36,377 --> 01:37:39,289
Are you sure
you won't go to the hospital?

933
01:37:40,577 --> 01:37:43,296
People like me can't go out
into the light.

934
01:37:44,657 --> 01:37:45,612
Same here.

935
01:37:46,457 --> 01:37:49,608
I'll get more credits if I bleed.
Did I cause you trouble?

936
01:37:49,897 --> 01:37:51,376
It's just a report.

937
01:37:52,857 --> 01:37:55,690
- Be careful when dealing with Sam.
- You too.

938
01:37:57,017 --> 01:37:58,530
It was Sam who set you up.

939
01:37:58,777 --> 01:38:00,847
You won't bump into me next time.

940
01:38:02,657 --> 01:38:04,887
Will we see each other again?

941
01:38:05,537 --> 01:38:07,971
- I'll pass.
- Speak Mandarin.

942
01:38:08,217 --> 01:38:10,447
I'm going to Beijing next week.
Come along.

943
01:38:11,497 --> 01:38:12,816
I'll quit after this.

944
01:38:15,297 --> 01:38:16,207
And you?

945
01:38:17,097 --> 01:38:19,008
I'm a mole,

946
01:38:19,737 --> 01:38:21,011
we don't have holidays.

947
01:38:23,617 --> 01:38:24,572
OK.

948
01:38:26,017 --> 01:38:28,326
See you. See you.

949
01:38:28,577 --> 01:38:31,774
You haven't told us yet.
What's your name?

950
01:38:34,097 --> 01:38:35,086
Name?

951
01:38:35,817 --> 01:38:36,852
I don't know.

952
01:38:37,097 --> 01:38:38,974
Just call me Shadow.

953
01:38:39,737 --> 01:38:41,011
That's so corny!

954
01:38:44,017 --> 01:38:45,211
It's time for me to go.

955
01:38:46,177 --> 01:38:49,567
You haven't answered me yet.
I asked you if you recognised me.

956
01:38:51,537 --> 01:38:53,334
At the cadet school in 1991,

957
01:38:53,577 --> 01:38:56,137
if you hadn't left,
I wouldn't have got the Award.

958
01:40:17,977 --> 01:40:21,208
Lau's been taken to the hospital.
He's still in critical condition.

959
01:40:21,417 --> 01:40:23,885
The bullet is in his brain.

960
01:40:24,577 --> 01:40:26,693
The doctors
say that even if he recovers,

961
01:40:26,937 --> 01:40:28,848
his brain will be severely damaged.

962
01:40:29,097 --> 01:40:31,736
His room is full
of information about the moles.

963
01:40:31,977 --> 01:40:34,775
The department
was covered by hidden cameras

964
01:40:35,017 --> 01:40:37,212
that were connected
to Yeung's computer.

965
01:41:00,737 --> 01:41:01,647
Hello?

966
01:41:04,377 --> 01:41:05,412
Mary?

967
01:41:06,777 --> 01:41:08,529
He won't be able to meet you.

968
01:41:33,737 --> 01:41:38,413
DECEMBER 2002
TEN DAYS AFTER YAN'S DEATH

969
01:41:50,017 --> 01:41:51,609
He's dead.

970
01:41:52,377 --> 01:41:53,969
What's the point?

971
01:41:58,417 --> 01:42:01,614
There are things we've got to do.

972
01:42:38,137 --> 01:42:40,207
Hey, you're right.

973
01:43:33,737 --> 01:43:35,056
Dr Lee,

974
01:43:35,897 --> 01:43:37,649
everything will be OK after today.

975
01:43:38,577 --> 01:43:41,455
I'll arrest Lau Kin Ming myself.

976
01:43:52,337 --> 01:43:55,454
ONE MONTH LATER

977
01:44:12,337 --> 01:44:13,895
I'm giving it back to you.

978
01:44:17,657 --> 01:44:19,329
He turned me into a cripple.

979
01:44:50,097 --> 01:44:51,735
Was he Yan's friend?

980
01:44:58,137 --> 01:45:00,935
They were in cadet school together.

981
01:45:05,177 --> 01:45:08,328
12 YEARS EARLIER

982
01:45:08,817 --> 01:45:11,570
You have to follow the rules
at cadet school.

983
01:45:11,817 --> 01:45:15,526
Those who break the rules will be
like him. They'll be expelled.

984
01:45:16,537 --> 01:45:18,732
Who wants to trade places with him?

985
01:45:22,457 --> 01:45:25,335
Yeung, congratulations
on getting the Award.

986
01:45:26,057 --> 01:45:28,571
Would he have got it
if he hadn't been expelled?

987
01:45:47,817 --> 01:45:49,250
Perhaps that's fate.

988
01:45:50,417 --> 01:45:53,136
Destiny is destiny.

989
01:45:54,777 --> 01:45:58,611
Men are changed by events,
not events by men.

990
01:46:01,697 --> 01:46:02,766
But these two men...

991
01:46:04,497 --> 01:46:06,374
...they have changed certain events.

992
01:46:11,537 --> 01:46:12,447
OK...

993
01:46:13,937 --> 01:46:15,575
Let bygones be bygones.

994
01:46:17,857 --> 01:46:19,609
Tomorrow is another day.

995
01:46:24,017 --> 01:46:24,972
Bye.

996
01:46:56,177 --> 01:47:00,614
SEVEN MONTHS LATER

997
01:47:30,137 --> 01:47:31,490
You're here?

998
01:48:00,097 --> 01:48:01,610
The baby can say "daddy" now.

999
01:48:31,897 --> 01:48:34,365
He shot me so I shot him back,
like a triad would.

1000
01:48:34,617 --> 01:48:36,892
NOVEMBER 2002
A WEEK BEFORE YAN'S DEATH

1001
01:48:37,137 --> 01:48:40,015
Stop having a go at me
and learn from Yeung.

1002
01:48:40,257 --> 01:48:41,212
Learn what?

1003
01:48:41,457 --> 01:48:43,175
Learn how to write a report.

1004
01:48:43,417 --> 01:48:45,612
If you've killed someone,
it's a big deal.

1005
01:48:45,857 --> 01:48:47,210
So it's OK if I got killed?

1006
01:48:48,417 --> 01:48:49,736
Send me a report.

1007
01:48:49,977 --> 01:48:51,490
I'll send you nothing.

1008
01:48:52,177 --> 01:48:53,292
What did you say?

1009
01:49:02,617 --> 01:49:04,369
- You can go.
- What?

1010
01:49:04,617 --> 01:49:06,733
- Lunchtime.
- I've just had breakfast.

1011
01:49:06,977 --> 01:49:09,696
Would you rather eat shit instead?

1012
01:49:19,017 --> 01:49:20,336
Excuse me.

1013
01:49:20,617 --> 01:49:21,845
What is it?

1014
01:49:23,617 --> 01:49:26,131
I'd like to try this stereo.

1015
01:49:37,577 --> 01:49:39,886
KSITIGARBHA SUTRA:

1016
01:49:40,137 --> 01:49:43,846
SUCH PEOPLE SHALL BE CAST
INTO THE NEVER-ENDING HELL

1017
01:49:44,097 --> 01:49:47,806
AND WILL SUFFER CONTINUOUSLY
FOREVER AND EVER

1018
01:49:48,057 --> 01:49:50,890
WITH NO MEANS OF ESCAPE.
