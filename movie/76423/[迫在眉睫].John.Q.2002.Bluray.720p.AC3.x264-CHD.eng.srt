1
00:01:44,766 --> 00:01:46,063
Come on.

2
00:02:57,372 --> 00:03:00,000
The problem is, our economy is slowing down.

3
00:03:00,142 --> 00:03:02,372
You all know that as well as anybody does.

4
00:03:02,611 --> 00:03:07,048
I bet you've got friends and maybe yourself understand what it means

5
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:10,146
to have credit card debt

6
00:03:10,452 --> 00:03:12,716
and whenyou couple that with high energy bills,

7
00:03:12,988 --> 00:03:15,354
there are some people beginning to feel pinched.

8
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,616
John?

9
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,825
Honey, what's wrong?

10
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:25,365
What are you doing?

11
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,228
What's it look like?

12
00:03:26,368 --> 00:03:27,562
That's my car.

13
00:03:27,703 --> 00:03:28,761
That's not what the bank says.

14
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:30,371
Come on!

15
00:03:30,505 --> 00:03:32,234
Try paying your bills.

16
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,963
What's going on?

17
00:04:05,373 --> 00:04:08,536
I'm sorry. I talked to the bank. They promised they'd work with me.

18
00:04:08,677 --> 00:04:10,440
John, that was two months ago.

19
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:13,377
We're down to one last month's rent.

20
00:04:13,515 --> 00:04:15,380
It's either the car or the house, so I thought...

21
00:04:15,517 --> 00:04:16,541
You thought.

22
00:04:16,785 --> 00:04:17,911
What do you want me to do?

23
00:04:18,053 --> 00:04:20,817
You want them to throw us out? I'm down to 20 hours at the plant.

24
00:04:20,956 --> 00:04:24,551
They're shipping all the jobs to Mexico. What do you want me to do?

25
00:04:24,693 --> 00:04:25,990
John, my car is gone.

26
00:04:26,128 --> 00:04:29,256
I understand. Now you see I'm trying to find a second job, baby.

27
00:04:29,397 --> 00:04:31,695
You want me to say it's fine? 

28
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,801
All right, it's fine.

29
00:04:35,604 --> 00:04:37,504
The car is still ours. We own it.

30
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:41,131
I got to wait for my next cheque. In two weeks, we'll be fine.

31
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,640
Mikey!

32
00:04:47,315 --> 00:04:49,749
Yeah! Ronnie Coleman. 

33
00:04:49,885 --> 00:04:51,750
Mr Olympia two year running.

34
00:04:51,887 --> 00:04:53,411
Yeah! 

35
00:04:54,589 --> 00:04:56,022
Sit down. Eat breakfast.

36
00:04:56,158 --> 00:04:56,783
I am eating.

37
00:04:56,925 --> 00:04:57,983
A doughnut isn't breakfast.

38
00:04:58,126 --> 00:04:59,957
It's the continental breakfast.

39
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:01,653
We're not on a continent right now.

40
00:05:01,797 --> 00:05:04,129
Dad, what do you call North America?

41
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:07,030
You're not going to school till you eat breakfast, so eat.

42
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:08,729
Both of you.

43
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,072
I can't believe those jerks took our car.

44
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:14,966
Can you, Mom?

45
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,236
No, I can't.

46
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:17,773
What are we going to do?

47
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:20,072
You're going to do something, right, Dad?

48
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:21,843
You know what I'd do?

49
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,215
I'd get so big and mad,

50
00:05:24,352 --> 00:05:25,649
I'd go crazy and kick someone's butt.

51
00:05:25,787 --> 00:05:26,583
Watch your language.

52
00:05:26,721 --> 00:05:27,449
I would.

53
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:29,614
You been watching too much WW Wrestling.

54
00:05:29,758 --> 00:05:32,818
Not wrestling, Dad. Bodybuilding.

55
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:34,394
There's a big difference.

56
00:05:34,696 --> 00:05:36,527
Get your books. You're going to be late.

57
00:05:36,665 --> 00:05:38,360


58
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,889
Hurry up, baby.

59
00:05:46,908 --> 00:05:48,273
Can I get a ride to work?

60
00:06:07,095 --> 00:06:10,050
I love you

61
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,814
Oh, you know I really do

62
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:14,836
- All right, all right. I got a good one.

63
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:18,906
If I ever seen a girl

64
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,870
That...Go ahead.

65
00:06:20,675 --> 00:06:22,575
That you needed 

66
00:06:22,711 --> 00:06:23,575
Go ahead.

67
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:24,970
Radishes.

68
00:06:25,113 --> 00:06:27,081
No, it's...

69
00:06:27,282 --> 00:06:28,442
Reddish stick.

70
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,549
It's "radio station."

71
00:06:30,685 --> 00:06:32,175
Radio station. Okay. 

72
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,947
That's a good one. You got me.

73
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:42,353
Honey?

74
00:06:44,332 --> 00:06:45,629
Hundred dollars?

75
00:06:46,201 --> 00:06:47,828
No, we talked about it this morning.

76
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:48,958
Continent.

77
00:06:50,505 --> 00:06:51,096
Continent.

78
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:54,606
Got you, right? Mom?

79
00:06:54,743 --> 00:06:55,869
How about you, Mom?

80
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,870
Come on, baby.

81
00:07:00,015 --> 00:07:01,073
You just laugh at me.

82
00:07:01,216 --> 00:07:02,877
I don't like it. I'm no good at it.

83
00:07:03,251 --> 00:07:05,014
All right, something in the car.

84
00:07:05,153 --> 00:07:05,983
We won't laugh.

85
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:07,179
We won't laugh.

86
00:07:07,322 --> 00:07:08,482
Please?

87
00:07:10,392 --> 00:07:10,824
All right.

88
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,654
We can't know what you're saying.

89
00:07:17,365 --> 00:07:18,525
What? 

90
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:20,259
What did you say?

91
00:07:20,602 --> 00:07:22,160
I said...

92
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,534
What?

93
00:07:32,747 --> 00:07:35,545
Come get this woman, please.

94
00:07:35,684 --> 00:07:36,878
What, it's no good?

95
00:07:38,787 --> 00:07:41,722
Come on. Come on, baby.

96
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,958
I'll thumb-wrestle you.

97
00:07:44,092 --> 00:07:44,922
All right.

98
00:07:45,193 --> 00:07:46,854
One, two, three.

99
00:07:50,365 --> 00:07:52,094
- One, two, three. She wins.
- You got it.

100
00:07:53,068 --> 00:07:55,036
I am queen.

101
00:07:55,904 --> 00:07:56,996
All right, I got one.

102
00:07:57,138 --> 00:07:59,436
I got one for you. You're going to school.

103
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,836
Get your lunch.

104
00:08:13,855 --> 00:08:14,446
Dad, 

105
00:08:14,923 --> 00:08:17,790
I got $46 I saved from my allowance.

106
00:08:18,093 --> 00:08:19,458
You can have it if you want.

107
00:08:19,594 --> 00:08:20,356
Yeah?

108
00:08:20,662 --> 00:08:23,597
We're a family. We got to stick together, right?

109
00:08:23,732 --> 00:08:24,858
That's right.

110
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:27,901
But you earned that money, so you keep it, okay?

111
00:08:28,136 --> 00:08:29,467
All right. See you later.

112
00:08:31,206 --> 00:08:32,195
Bye, Mike.

113
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,034
Not good-bye. I hate good-bye.

114
00:08:35,677 --> 00:08:38,043
Remember? "See you later."

115
00:08:38,346 --> 00:08:39,711
All right, see you later.

116
00:08:40,248 --> 00:08:40,976
Mike.

117
00:08:43,018 --> 00:08:47,011
Flex Wheeler...275 pounds, 

118
00:08:47,288 --> 00:08:49,620
2% body fat.

119
00:08:49,758 --> 00:08:52,488
Yeah, baby.

120
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:32,429
John! 

121
00:09:33,134 --> 00:09:34,829
You take my grinding wheel?

122
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:35,697
What?

123
00:09:35,837 --> 00:09:37,862
My grinding wheel!

124
00:09:38,006 --> 00:09:39,030
I do, don't I?

125
00:09:39,174 --> 00:09:39,799
You do?

126
00:09:39,941 --> 00:09:41,272
Yeah, I have sex appeal.

127
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:44,307
No, it's not in my locker. My grinding wheel.

128
00:09:44,446 --> 00:09:45,572
Do you want mine?

129
00:09:45,713 --> 00:09:48,614
Only two people know the combination to my locker.

130
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,877
That's my grinder and you know it.

131
00:09:51,386 --> 00:09:54,446
- John! Smoke, all right?
- All right.

132
00:10:00,128 --> 00:10:01,823
What's with the tie? Somebody die?

133
00:10:01,963 --> 00:10:02,657
You like that?

134
00:10:03,264 --> 00:10:05,357
That's the tie I'm wearing to my funeral

135
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,762
if I don't get this job at Otisville today.

136
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:08,300
There are no jobs.

137
00:10:08,436 --> 00:10:10,495
I saw it in the classifieds. They're hiring.

138
00:10:10,638 --> 00:10:11,605
Forget about it.

139
00:10:11,739 --> 00:10:12,671
I got to go, though.

140
00:10:12,807 --> 00:10:13,705
How come?

141
00:10:14,142 --> 00:10:16,474
They repo'd our car this morning.

142
00:10:16,611 --> 00:10:17,908
Oh, boy.

143
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,174
You want me to go with you?

144
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:20,872
Come on.

145
00:10:24,786 --> 00:10:26,981
Fifty cents! 

146
00:10:27,522 --> 00:10:28,819
This is a frigging waste of time.

147
00:10:29,891 --> 00:10:32,985
Four hundred people for one job? Give me a break.

148
00:10:33,128 --> 00:10:36,529
Guaranteed somebody's son, cousin, uncle already got this job sewn up.

149
00:10:36,664 --> 00:10:39,098
Why did they put it in the paper if they're not hiring?

150
00:10:39,234 --> 00:10:40,826
It's a frigging run-around. Mark my words.

151
00:10:40,969 --> 00:10:44,370
It's either, "We'll keep your application
on file" 

152
00:10:44,506 --> 00:10:46,440
or, "You're overqualified."

153
00:10:46,574 --> 00:10:48,838
Either way, they screw you.

154
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,208
Archibald!

155
00:10:56,784 --> 00:10:59,651
I've been working heavy machinery for 15 years.

156
00:11:00,722 --> 00:11:03,623
I really want the job. Anything you want, I can do.

157
00:11:03,758 --> 00:11:04,782
I see.

158
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,152
I can start today if you need.

159
00:11:10,965 --> 00:11:12,990
Your resume is very impressive.

160
00:11:13,134 --> 00:11:15,500
You've certainly got the experience.

161
00:11:16,804 --> 00:11:20,501
Frankly, you may be overqualified.

162
00:11:21,142 --> 00:11:23,474
We'll keep your application on file.

163
00:11:26,047 --> 00:11:31,349
Jesus loves me, this I know

164
00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:35,687
For the Bible tells...

165
00:11:35,823 --> 00:11:36,790
Dad, 

166
00:11:37,325 --> 00:11:41,091
the game starts in 15 minutes. We're going to be late.

167
00:11:41,229 --> 00:11:49,534
They are weak, but he is strong

168
00:11:50,138 --> 00:11:55,201
Yes, Jesus loves me

169
00:11:55,677 --> 00:12:00,580
The Bible tells me so

170
00:12:03,952 --> 00:12:05,647
Knock it out, baby! Come on! To the fence!

171
00:12:05,787 --> 00:12:08,551
Come on, Tommy!

172
00:12:16,598 --> 00:12:17,690
Ball four!

173
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:20,728
Go, Mikey!

174
00:12:24,606 --> 00:12:27,234
Let's go, baby. Let's go, son. All right.

175
00:12:28,243 --> 00:12:30,006
- Come on, boy!
- Knock it out!

176
00:12:30,144 --> 00:12:34,137
Keep your head down on the ball, son.

177
00:12:34,515 --> 00:12:36,779
Knock it out for your mama, baby.

178
00:12:36,918 --> 00:12:38,215
Come on, Mikey!

179
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:41,660
- Sometime today, pitcher.
- There you go.

180
00:12:44,025 --> 00:12:44,889
- Strike!

181
00:12:45,026 --> 00:12:46,254
Don't worry about it, son.

182
00:12:46,394 --> 00:12:47,588
You blind?

183
00:12:47,729 --> 00:12:49,026
Keep your head down on the ball!

184
00:12:49,163 --> 00:12:50,562
I hate this pitcher. How old is he?

185
00:12:50,698 --> 00:12:51,596
He's supposed to be twelve.

186
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:53,633
Twelve, my ass. Look at him.

187
00:12:53,835 --> 00:12:55,860
His beard grew an inch between pitches.

188
00:12:56,971 --> 00:12:58,165
For your mama, baby.

189
00:12:58,306 --> 00:12:59,568
Put your elbow up, son.

190
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:04,017
- Go, baby!
- There you go, baby!

191
00:13:04,545 --> 00:13:05,944
Safe!

192
00:13:06,281 --> 00:13:08,010
Tie goes to the runner.

193
00:13:09,384 --> 00:13:13,548
Run!

194
00:13:21,262 --> 00:13:22,251
Second base!

195
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:27,056
Michael?

196
00:13:30,204 --> 00:13:31,398
Mikey, baby.

197
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,076
Somebody call an ambulance!

198
00:13:38,146 --> 00:13:40,410
Somebody call a frigging ambulance!

199
00:13:44,316 --> 00:13:46,354
- Get the door!
- Get the door, Jimmy.

200
00:13:46,485 --> 00:13:47,288
- Got it. Come on, let's go!
- It's going to be okay.

201
00:13:51,781 --> 00:13:52,627
- Take him, baby.
- Give him to me.

202
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,868
It's Mama. Come on, Mikey.
We got to get out of here. Go!

203
00:14:30,431 --> 00:14:31,261
Help us!

204
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,473
Help! Please, somebody.

205
00:14:32,573 --> 00:14:33,001
Calm down.

206
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:34,864
He's not breathing.

207
00:14:35,002 --> 00:14:36,367
All right, come with me.

208
00:14:37,872 --> 00:14:40,500
He was just playing baseball, running to second base.

209
00:14:40,641 --> 00:14:43,439
- I don't know what happened.
- I need a doctor right away, please!

210
00:14:44,946 --> 00:14:45,674
No. Jesus.

211
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:47,905
- What happened?

212
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:49,243
He collapsed playing baseball.

213
00:14:49,384 --> 00:14:50,316
- Get him on oxygen.
- Look at Mama.

214
00:14:50,451 --> 00:14:52,248
He's going to be all right, isn't he?

215
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,583
Wake up.

216
00:14:54,722 --> 00:14:55,518
Anything like this ever happen before?

217
00:14:55,656 --> 00:14:56,213
No, ma'am.

218
00:14:56,357 --> 00:14:57,016
Any allergies?

219
00:14:57,158 --> 00:14:57,988
Nothing.

220
00:14:58,126 --> 00:14:59,184
No medication within the past year?

221
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,123
Nothing!

222
00:15:00,261 --> 00:15:00,955
Allergies to medication?

223
00:15:01,095 --> 00:15:02,528
He's fine. 

224
00:15:02,663 --> 00:15:03,960
He just fell down.

225
00:15:04,098 --> 00:15:05,122
His liver's enlarged. Flip him.

226
00:15:05,266 --> 00:15:06,733
He's going to be all right, isn't he?

227
00:15:06,968 --> 00:15:08,026
Pulse is 150,

228
00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:10,228
pulse ox 78%. B.P. 68 over 34.

229
00:15:10,371 --> 00:15:11,668
What is the matter with him?

230
00:15:11,806 --> 00:15:13,171
Would you come with me?

231
00:15:13,408 --> 00:15:15,239
There are procedures we need to go over.

232
00:15:15,376 --> 00:15:16,138
What kind of procedures?

233
00:15:16,277 --> 00:15:17,608
We're admitting your son.

234
00:15:17,745 --> 00:15:18,939
You need to fill out the proper forms.

235
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,842
What kind of forms?

236
00:15:19,981 --> 00:15:22,040
Your son may need a transfusion.

237
00:15:23,017 --> 00:15:24,143
We'll need to test you both for blood type.

238
00:15:24,285 --> 00:15:26,219
We're coming right back, baby.

239
00:15:26,354 --> 00:15:27,150
Wait a minute!

240
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:30,181
First name, Mr Archibald.

241
00:15:30,324 --> 00:15:31,154
John.

242
00:15:31,826 --> 00:15:32,850
Middle initial?

243
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,960
Q. Quincy.

244
00:15:35,229 --> 00:15:36,696
Name of your insurance company?

245
00:15:37,865 --> 00:15:39,355
Where is he? Is he okay?

246
00:15:40,201 --> 00:15:42,431
We don't know. They're running tests. We're waiting to find the results.

247
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,162
Is there anything we can do?

248
00:15:44,672 --> 00:15:45,832
- Your card, Mr Archibald.

249
00:15:46,774 --> 00:15:47,638
I'm sorry.

250
00:15:47,775 --> 00:15:48,833
Your insurance card.

251
00:15:48,976 --> 00:15:51,171
I'll need to make a copy for our files.

252
00:15:57,618 --> 00:15:59,017
It's okay. You can go in now.

253
00:16:27,281 --> 00:16:29,112
Sweetheart.

254
00:16:35,156 --> 00:16:36,783
How you doing, slugger?

255
00:16:39,494 --> 00:16:42,088
I can't talk.

256
00:16:42,763 --> 00:16:43,457
Don't worry about it. 

257
00:16:43,598 --> 00:16:46,692
Get your rest. We're going to be out of here in a while.

258
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,603
We love you, son.

259
00:16:52,073 --> 00:16:53,665
I love you, too.

260
00:16:56,911 --> 00:16:58,811
What is all this?

261
00:16:59,146 --> 00:17:00,135
This? 

262
00:17:00,348 --> 00:17:02,111
This is so we can monitor Mike's vitals.

263
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,377
Respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, 

264
00:17:04,452 --> 00:17:05,578
heart rate.

265
00:17:05,853 --> 00:17:07,411
And this one is blood pressure...

266
00:17:08,155 --> 00:17:10,282
diastolic and systolic.

267
00:17:10,424 --> 00:17:13,086
We'd like this top number to stay above 90.

268
00:17:13,394 --> 00:17:16,261
If his blood pressure drops, we're going to have to do something.

269
00:17:16,397 --> 00:17:18,388
We can't have him going below 70 again.

270
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:22,692
Why? What would that mean, if he went below 70 again?

271
00:17:23,204 --> 00:17:26,105
70 and below, he's in heart failure.

272
00:17:30,244 --> 00:17:31,233
If you need anything.

273
00:17:31,379 --> 00:17:32,346
Thank you.

274
00:17:39,587 --> 00:17:40,747
How's the company insurance?

275
00:17:40,888 --> 00:17:42,913
He works part time.

276
00:17:43,057 --> 00:17:45,048
She works as a grocery store clerk.

277
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:46,159
Can we do anything?

278
00:17:46,294 --> 00:17:47,454
I got to go.

279
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,023
Mr and Mrs Archibald.

280
00:17:51,165 --> 00:17:52,325
I'm Rebecca Payne, Hospital Director.

281
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:54,095
Hi there.

282
00:17:54,235 --> 00:17:54,894
It's nice to meet you.

283
00:17:55,036 --> 00:17:56,503
This is Dr Turner, head of Cardiology 

284
00:17:56,637 --> 00:17:57,626
and Michael's doctor.

285
00:17:57,772 --> 00:17:59,637
How do you do?

286
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,467
Good. My wife.

287
00:18:01,842 --> 00:18:03,241
How's our boy doing?

288
00:18:04,445 --> 00:18:05,810
Please sit down.

289
00:18:28,135 --> 00:18:30,763
This x-ray shows a normal nine-year-old's heart.

290
00:18:31,172 --> 00:18:34,198
This x-ray is that of your son Michael.

291
00:18:35,776 --> 00:18:38,973
There are septal defects 

292
00:18:39,113 --> 00:18:41,479
here, here, and here

293
00:18:41,616 --> 00:18:44,107
which have induced myopathy, resulting pulmonary edema,

294
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:46,151
and malignant ventricular ectopy.

295
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,409
Michael's heart is approximately

296
00:18:47,555 --> 00:18:50,581
three times larger than normal size.

297
00:18:50,725 --> 00:18:51,817
I'm sorry.

298
00:18:53,794 --> 00:18:54,886
I didn't understand what you said.

299
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:57,327
Could you put that in layman terms?

300
00:18:57,565 --> 00:18:58,657
Basically, 

301
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,927
there's not enough blood being pumped by Michael's heart,

302
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:04,594
so it backs up in the lungs

303
00:19:04,739 --> 00:19:06,263
like a sponge getting wet.

304
00:19:06,941 --> 00:19:10,502
His heart is trying, but it's working too hard.

305
00:19:10,778 --> 00:19:13,747
What, does he need an operation, or...

306
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:18,113
We're considerably beyond corrective surgery, Mr and Mrs Archibald.

307
00:19:18,252 --> 00:19:21,050
Mike's heart is useless.

308
00:19:21,722 --> 00:19:24,520
He's going to need a transplant or he's going to die.

309
00:19:27,261 --> 00:19:29,889
Wait a second. There are other options.

310
00:19:30,031 --> 00:19:30,963
What options?

311
00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:34,766
To do nothing. Medicate him.

312
00:19:34,935 --> 00:19:36,425
Make him feel as comfortable as possible.

313
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,198
You're going to have to start thinking about quality of life now.

314
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,967
I don't understand.

315
00:19:41,942 --> 00:19:43,534
We were just with him 

316
00:19:43,678 --> 00:19:45,942
and he seemed fine.

317
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,708
He's going to seem fine, but as his heart gets worse,

318
00:19:48,849 --> 00:19:51,113
he will become increasingly fatigued,

319
00:19:51,352 --> 00:19:53,115
and he will sleep more and more,

320
00:19:53,988 --> 00:19:56,149
until one day he will fall asleep,

321
00:19:57,191 --> 00:19:58,852
and he won't wake up.

322
00:20:00,561 --> 00:20:02,051
I know this is difficult,

323
00:20:02,196 --> 00:20:04,528
but you have to face the fact

324
00:20:04,665 --> 00:20:06,633
that your son may not live much longer.

325
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:10,294
You might want to make it a happy time, say good-bye.

326
00:20:11,572 --> 00:20:13,005
God.

327
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,141
Transplantation is a high-risk operation.

328
00:20:16,277 --> 00:20:19,212
You could lose your son on that table.

329
00:20:21,982 --> 00:20:25,975
You might not want to take that chance.

330
00:20:30,858 --> 00:20:32,382
If he doesn't have the surgery...

331
00:20:32,526 --> 00:20:33,823
If he doesn't have the surgery, how long would he live?

332
00:20:33,961 --> 00:20:34,791
Not long. 

333
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:36,396
Months, weeks.

334
00:20:37,298 --> 00:20:38,731
Days.

335
00:20:40,367 --> 00:20:43,803
Come on. All right.

336
00:20:43,938 --> 00:20:45,371
Come on, now.

337
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,907
I'm sorry.

338
00:20:56,917 --> 00:20:58,509
This is a lot.

339
00:21:14,268 --> 00:21:15,030
All right.

340
00:21:19,774 --> 00:21:22,038
If he was your son, what would you do?

341
00:21:23,978 --> 00:21:25,946
I'd do the transplant, absolutely.

342
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,069
Okay.

343
00:21:28,215 --> 00:21:29,409
Okay? 

344
00:21:31,552 --> 00:21:34,248
Let's do that. Let's do it.

345
00:21:37,892 --> 00:21:40,918
First we've got to get Mike's name on the organ recipient list.

346
00:21:41,061 --> 00:21:43,962
He's B-positive, so his name should go right to the top.

347
00:21:44,098 --> 00:21:45,360
It's not so simple.

348
00:21:45,499 --> 00:21:46,989
There are other considerations before

349
00:21:47,134 --> 00:21:49,102
a recipient can be placed on a donor list.

350
00:21:49,236 --> 00:21:52,672
Transplant surgery is very expensive.

351
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,903
In most cases, prohibitively so.

352
00:21:55,042 --> 00:21:56,475
We got insurance, 

353
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,271
major medical.He's covered.

354
00:21:58,412 --> 00:22:00,778
We've already checked with your carrier, Mr Archibald.

355
00:22:01,081 --> 00:22:03,982
There are no provisions in your policy for a procedure of this magnitude.

356
00:22:04,118 --> 00:22:06,916
That's a mistake.

357
00:22:07,054 --> 00:22:08,521
Not that you're making a mistake.

358
00:22:08,656 --> 00:22:11,557
I'm just saying that I'm insured. 

359
00:22:11,692 --> 00:22:13,159
My son's covered.

360
00:22:13,561 --> 00:22:14,687
Mrs Archibald, 

361
00:22:14,829 --> 00:22:15,557
do you have coverage?

362
00:22:15,696 --> 00:22:19,757
No. I've only been working at the supermarket a couple months.

363
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,061
Doesn't matter. We got insurance.

364
00:22:24,905 --> 00:22:27,601
I can see here that you don't own your home.

365
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:30,704
You have no stocks, no bonds, no investments.

366
00:22:30,911 --> 00:22:32,640
You have a little over $1,000 in savings.

367
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,247
But we got insurance.

368
00:22:34,381 --> 00:22:36,246
That may very well be. 

369
00:22:36,383 --> 00:22:38,408
You're going to have to check with your carrier.

370
00:22:38,552 --> 00:22:40,679
In the meantime, we're going to have to treat this as a cash account.

371
00:22:40,821 --> 00:22:41,947
What?

372
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:43,078
How much does a transplant cost?

373
00:22:43,224 --> 00:22:44,589
Wait a minute. 

374
00:22:44,725 --> 00:22:46,659
How much does it cost?

375
00:22:47,728 --> 00:22:49,389
Transplant surgery, doctors' fees, 

376
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:52,124
postoperative care,immunosuppressant drugs...

377
00:22:52,266 --> 00:22:55,258
you're looking at a minimum of $250,000.

378
00:22:55,636 --> 00:22:58,696
If you opt for transplant surgery, 

379
00:22:58,839 --> 00:22:59,931
that is your choice,

380
00:23:00,074 --> 00:23:02,565
but the hospital maintains a very

381
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,143
strict policy with regard to cash patients.

382
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:07,179
We require down payment before we put

383
00:23:07,314 --> 00:23:08,906
a patient's name on a receivers' list.

384
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:09,975
How much?

385
00:23:10,117 --> 00:23:11,084
What kind of down payment?

386
00:23:11,218 --> 00:23:12,310
30%...

387
00:23:12,586 --> 00:23:14,110
$75,000.

388
00:23:14,421 --> 00:23:16,412
$75,000...

389
00:23:18,993 --> 00:23:20,688
To put my son's name on a list.

390
00:23:20,828 --> 00:23:23,888
Our son is upstairs dying. All you can do is talk about money?

391
00:23:24,031 --> 00:23:26,329
It costs money to provide health care.

392
00:23:27,167 --> 00:23:29,658
It's expensive for you, it's expensive for us.

393
00:23:29,803 --> 00:23:30,497
You're going to have to guarantee payment

394
00:23:30,638 --> 00:23:34,130
before I can put your son's name on the list.

395
00:23:37,411 --> 00:23:39,743
Mr and Mrs Archibald, please wait!

396
00:23:42,116 --> 00:23:43,708
If you people don't want to treat our son,

397
00:23:43,851 --> 00:23:45,216
we'll take him over to County Memorial.

398
00:23:45,352 --> 00:23:46,410
You don't want to do that.

399
00:23:46,553 --> 00:23:48,111
They have to treat him.

400
00:23:48,255 --> 00:23:49,222
Heart transplantation is

401
00:23:49,356 --> 00:23:52,450
always considered an elective procedure.

402
00:23:52,593 --> 00:23:54,584
You're in the right place.

403
00:23:54,728 --> 00:23:55,888
What are we supposed to do?

404
00:23:56,196 --> 00:23:57,823
Talk to your insurance company again.

405
00:23:57,965 --> 00:24:00,593
Check with our human resources department for medical assistance.

406
00:24:00,734 --> 00:24:01,496
There's money. 

407
00:24:01,635 --> 00:24:04,160
There's Children's State Services and Medicaid.

408
00:24:04,305 --> 00:24:06,466
You find a way to keep him here.

409
00:24:06,707 --> 00:24:08,538
You just don't take no for an answer.

410
00:24:10,878 --> 00:24:14,279
Your policy has changed, Mr Archibald.

411
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,412
Changed to what?

412
00:24:17,251 --> 00:24:19,685
We've recently switched carriers

413
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,287
from a PPO to an HMO.

414
00:24:21,422 --> 00:24:22,684
It's a less expensive policy.

415
00:24:22,823 --> 00:24:25,758
Unfortunately, there are some restrictions.

416
00:24:25,893 --> 00:24:27,121
What kind of restrictions?

417
00:24:27,261 --> 00:24:28,455
Here's how it works.

418
00:24:29,096 --> 00:24:32,031
Non-management part-time employees such as yourself

419
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:35,693
only qualify for second-tier catastrophic coverage.

420
00:24:35,836 --> 00:24:37,167
I'm not part time, I'm full time.

421
00:24:37,304 --> 00:24:39,169
It's just slow right now.

422
00:24:39,306 --> 00:24:40,000
Sure, 

423
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,803
but your coverage is based on hours worked.

424
00:24:43,944 --> 00:24:46,412
Like I said, you only qualify for second tier.

425
00:24:46,547 --> 00:24:49,380
That has a maximum payout limit of $20,000.

426
00:24:49,516 --> 00:24:50,574
What?

427
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,581
You have been taking money out of my cheque every week.

428
00:24:55,723 --> 00:24:57,623
I've been paying into this policy for years.

429
00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:01,219
That's why we're going to cover you for the full $20,000.

430
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,357
You're kidding me, right? Come on.

431
00:25:06,867 --> 00:25:10,826
You have dropped me from full time to part time. 

432
00:25:10,971 --> 00:25:12,302
You switched carriers.

433
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:14,771
Now you're telling me I'm not fully covered

434
00:25:14,908 --> 00:25:17,604
even though I got a policy that says I am?

435
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,246
It doesn't seem right, does it?

436
00:25:20,381 --> 00:25:21,370
No, it doesn't. 

437
00:25:21,515 --> 00:25:22,982
My son is very sick.

438
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,081
If I'm not covered, I got a serious problem.

439
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:28,677
I understand that, but there's nothing I can do.

440
00:25:28,822 --> 00:25:30,687
You can file an appeal.

441
00:25:30,824 --> 00:25:31,654
Yeah?

442
00:25:31,925 --> 00:25:32,892
Here you go. 

443
00:25:33,394 --> 00:25:35,624
That takes about seven working days.

444
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,305
Not enough.

445
00:25:54,448 --> 00:25:56,712
What little we have is already used up.

446
00:25:57,184 --> 00:25:58,151
You on welfare?

447
00:25:59,887 --> 00:26:01,286
You should be on welfare.

448
00:26:01,422 --> 00:26:03,219
We both have jobs.

449
00:26:03,357 --> 00:26:04,517
That's too bad.

450
00:26:05,225 --> 00:26:07,022
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

451
00:26:07,428 --> 00:26:09,123
Try County Medical.

452
00:26:09,396 --> 00:26:11,921
Yes, ma'am, I need to speak to somebody in Financial Aid.

453
00:26:13,634 --> 00:26:14,965
No, I don't want to hold.

454
00:26:15,202 --> 00:26:17,966
I've been holding for 15 minutes.

455
00:26:19,158 --> 00:26:23,210
We don't have enough money! Should I get another job?

456
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,402
I'm not yelling.

457
00:26:24,545 --> 00:26:25,739
You're yelling in here!

458
00:26:34,054 --> 00:26:34,952
Next, please.

459
00:26:40,227 --> 00:26:42,320
Wrong line. Window 15.

460
00:26:42,563 --> 00:26:43,461
What?

461
00:26:43,831 --> 00:26:44,991
Window 15.

462
00:27:03,817 --> 00:27:04,579
No.

463
00:27:04,785 --> 00:27:05,410
No, what?

464
00:27:05,552 --> 00:27:07,349
No, you don't qualify.

465
00:27:07,788 --> 00:27:09,278
My son is dying, I'm broke.

466
00:27:09,423 --> 00:27:10,549
If I don't qualify, who the hell does?

467
00:27:10,691 --> 00:27:11,385
I'm sorry.

468
00:27:12,226 --> 00:27:14,558
I don't need you to be sorry! I need you to help me!

469
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,988
No, this is an appeal.

470
00:27:43,257 --> 00:27:45,555
An appeal is for an already existing claim.

471
00:27:45,692 --> 00:27:47,683
You needed to file a grievance.

472
00:27:47,828 --> 00:27:49,819
- You filed the wrong paperwork.
- Wait a minute.

473
00:27:50,164 --> 00:27:52,689
You're going to have to resubmit. It could take 30 days.

474
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:53,857
I don't have 30 days.

475
00:27:54,001 --> 00:27:54,695
I know.

476
00:27:54,835 --> 00:27:56,462
I'm getting sick of the run-around.

477
00:27:56,603 --> 00:27:58,468
I need my son's name on that list.

478
00:27:58,605 --> 00:28:02,666
Your account is in excess of $30,000.

479
00:28:03,243 --> 00:28:05,575
The hospital has bent over backwards to help you out.

480
00:28:05,712 --> 00:28:06,303
Is that right?

481
00:28:06,446 --> 00:28:07,242
Yes, it is right.

482
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:10,009
But there is a limit to our generosity.

483
00:28:10,817 --> 00:28:14,275
Once and for all, your insurance does not cover this.

484
00:28:34,241 --> 00:28:35,401
Take it.

485
00:28:35,642 --> 00:28:36,108
Watch your step.

486
00:28:36,243 --> 00:28:37,107
This thing is frigging heavy.

487
00:28:37,244 --> 00:28:38,370
Get out of the way.

488
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:48,683
Friends, one among us is suffering in great pain today.

489
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,605
This is a good man.

490
00:29:34,268 --> 00:29:39,069
"'You can't say that you're not going to pitch. '

491
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,470
Bernie frowned, puzzled by Babe's answer. 'Okay, Babe."'

492
00:29:47,114 --> 00:29:49,048
Let us pray.

493
00:29:49,349 --> 00:29:51,579
God of mercy, into his hands Your son Jesus Christ

494
00:29:51,718 --> 00:29:54,619
commended his spirit at his last hour.

495
00:29:54,755 --> 00:29:56,188
Into those same hands, 

496
00:29:56,323 --> 00:29:59,087
we commend Your servant...

497
00:30:01,461 --> 00:30:03,122
You should try that news guy

498
00:30:03,263 --> 00:30:05,629
does all them special investigative reports.

499
00:30:05,766 --> 00:30:08,132
You know the one, the guy with the frigging hair?

500
00:30:08,268 --> 00:30:10,099
Pretty boy. What's his frigging name?

501
00:30:10,237 --> 00:30:10,760
Lampley.

502
00:30:10,904 --> 00:30:12,303
Tuck Lampley.

503
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,798
I'll give you $20 for the TV.

504
00:30:15,175 --> 00:30:16,039
It's a colour TV.

505
00:30:16,176 --> 00:30:17,234
$20.

506
00:30:22,282 --> 00:30:23,271
Call him up, Jimmy.

507
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:26,443
You don't mind if we walk and talk. I'm up to here today.

508
00:30:26,586 --> 00:30:27,518
Not at all.

509
00:30:27,654 --> 00:30:28,848
What can I do you for?

510
00:30:29,256 --> 00:30:31,190
My son Mike, 

511
00:30:31,325 --> 00:30:33,384
he fell into heart failure at this Little League game.

512
00:30:33,527 --> 00:30:36,985
I got full insurance from the job.

513
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,620
Now they're telling me they won't pay.

514
00:30:38,765 --> 00:30:41,256
What about the hospital? Don't they have to cover it?

515
00:30:41,401 --> 00:30:44,234
- That's what I was saying.
- They're telling me I got to pay cash.

516
00:30:44,371 --> 00:30:46,965
Otherwise I got to take my son home and watch him die.

517
00:30:48,575 --> 00:30:51,169
We was thinking you can do one of them special interest pieces.

518
00:30:51,311 --> 00:30:53,541
Send donations, write your congressman.

519
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,706
Anything you can do, Mr Lampley, would help.

520
00:30:57,317 --> 00:30:59,945
I think what's happening to your son is outrageous. I want to help.

521
00:31:00,087 --> 00:31:01,520
I got to run this by my producers.

522
00:31:01,655 --> 00:31:03,179
I got bosses like everybody else.

523
00:31:03,323 --> 00:31:04,415
Right.

524
00:31:04,491 --> 00:31:07,016
Leave your number with Karen up front.

525
00:31:07,461 --> 00:31:09,725
Thank you very much.

526
00:31:24,878 --> 00:31:27,574
Give me $100.

527
00:31:27,714 --> 00:31:29,648
Come on, it's a diamond ring.

528
00:31:30,117 --> 00:31:32,142
All right, $90. Give me $90, then.

529
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,457
He's going to die.

530
00:32:15,595 --> 00:32:16,562
What?

531
00:32:16,863 --> 00:32:18,831
They're releasing him.

532
00:32:18,965 --> 00:32:19,454
Who?

533
00:32:20,133 --> 00:32:23,432
Dr Turner just left here.

534
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:26,596
They are releasing Mike this morning.

535
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,538
They're not going to send him home.

536
00:32:29,676 --> 00:32:30,836
I gave them money yesterday.

537
00:32:30,977 --> 00:32:32,842
It doesn't matter. Listen to me.

538
00:32:32,979 --> 00:32:34,844
They are releasing him.

539
00:32:34,981 --> 00:32:37,609
I talked to the hospital.

540
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:38,740
They said... I'll take care of it.

541
00:32:38,885 --> 00:32:40,682
You always take care of everything,

542
00:32:41,621 --> 00:32:43,054
but it's never enough, is it?

543
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,122
You need to do something, 

544
00:32:45,525 --> 00:32:47,618
do you hear me? Do something!

545
00:33:33,106 --> 00:33:34,038
You're doing great. You really are.

546
00:33:34,174 --> 00:33:36,335
You've gained what, five pounds?

547
00:33:37,244 --> 00:33:40,577
You're the only patient I have who eats the food in this place.

548
00:33:41,648 --> 00:33:42,842
Doc, let me ask you something.

549
00:33:42,983 --> 00:33:44,848
How long before I'm able to play tennis?

550
00:33:44,985 --> 00:33:46,919
You couldn't play before you had a new heart. 

551
00:33:47,053 --> 00:33:49,078
Take up knitting.

552
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:50,754
I play tennis.

553
00:33:50,891 --> 00:33:52,017
We don't care.

554
00:33:52,158 --> 00:33:54,353
Would you please get back to work? Thank you.

555
00:33:54,694 --> 00:33:57,026
Heidi, make an appointment for us to have dinner next week.

556
00:33:57,163 --> 00:33:58,562
I'm going to cook.

557
00:33:58,698 --> 00:33:59,995
No,

558
00:34:00,133 --> 00:34:01,862
and you're not wearing lingerie around him the next month.

559
00:34:02,002 --> 00:34:03,867
You're not in his will. He told me.

560
00:34:04,004 --> 00:34:06,063
Don't push your luck.

561
00:34:06,373 --> 00:34:08,933
I gave the hospital $6,000 yesterday.

562
00:34:11,411 --> 00:34:12,673
Can I talk to you?

563
00:34:12,812 --> 00:34:14,245
Yes, sure.

564
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:19,851
Take care of him.

565
00:34:19,986 --> 00:34:21,283
Take care. Thank you.

566
00:34:27,761 --> 00:34:30,662
My wife Denise says you're going to send Michael home. Is that true?

567
00:34:30,797 --> 00:34:32,992
I'm a physician. 

568
00:34:33,133 --> 00:34:34,657
I don't make policy decisions.

569
00:34:34,801 --> 00:34:36,325
That's handled by the board of trustees.

570
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:37,959
You're the head of cardiac surgery.

571
00:34:38,104 --> 00:34:40,368
You make a recommendation, they're going to listen, aren't they?

572
00:34:40,507 --> 00:34:42,031
I make recommendations all the time.

573
00:34:42,175 --> 00:34:46,942
The final decision rests with the board. That's it? Send him home.

574
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,511
I'm afraid so.

575
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:52,646
Can we take a little walk?

576
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:55,080
It won't take long, I promise you.

577
00:34:55,221 --> 00:34:56,153
Fine.

578
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:00,225
I'm looking at the brochure last night.

579
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,660
It says this hospital

580
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:04,855
does over 300 heart surgeries a year.

581
00:35:04,998 --> 00:35:06,431
300 surgeries,

582
00:35:06,566 --> 00:35:09,034
$250,000 a pop.You know how much that is? 

583
00:35:09,169 --> 00:35:10,363
I did the math.

584
00:35:10,503 --> 00:35:13,233
That's $75 million worth of heart surgeries.

585
00:35:13,373 --> 00:35:15,534
You're telling me 

586
00:35:15,675 --> 00:35:16,437
you can't do one for me in good faith?

587
00:35:16,576 --> 00:35:18,339
I waived my fee in your son's case.

588
00:35:18,478 --> 00:35:19,877
I know you're not asking...

589
00:35:20,013 --> 00:35:21,344
Nobody asked you to waive the fee.

590
00:35:21,481 --> 00:35:22,448
I can raise the money.

591
00:35:22,582 --> 00:35:26,040
I already came up with $22,000, 

592
00:35:26,186 --> 00:35:29,314
and I swear to God on my life, I will pay for this 

593
00:35:29,456 --> 00:35:30,787
if you give me the opportunity.

594
00:35:30,924 --> 00:35:33,358
I'm only getting 20 hours on the job.

595
00:35:33,493 --> 00:35:36,053
I can do this. I can pay. I swear to God,

596
00:35:36,196 --> 00:35:37,720
I'll pay you the money back.

597
00:35:37,864 --> 00:35:40,025
I don't know how, but I promise you I will.

598
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:42,225
Trust me.

599
00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:44,894
I give you my word as a man. Please.

600
00:35:47,641 --> 00:35:50,109
Could you take your hands off me, please?

601
00:35:52,278 --> 00:35:53,870
I've done everything I can. I'm sorry.

602
00:35:54,014 --> 00:35:54,981
No, you haven't.

603
00:35:55,115 --> 00:35:56,082
Yes.

604
00:35:56,216 --> 00:35:57,774
Let's go inside and talk about it.

605
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,988
I'm not asking anymore, Doctor. I'm telling you.

606
00:36:06,126 --> 00:36:09,061
You are going to give my son a new heart, you understand me?

607
00:36:18,271 --> 00:36:19,260
Don't move.

608
00:36:31,685 --> 00:36:33,243
Don't even think about it.

609
00:36:34,587 --> 00:36:36,020
Put your hands down.

610
00:36:37,323 --> 00:36:38,255
Mr Archibald, I...

611
00:36:38,391 --> 00:36:38,982
Shut up.

612
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:41,685
I know how upset you are, but this is not the way to handle it.

613
00:36:42,562 --> 00:36:43,893
You can't go through this way.

614
00:36:44,731 --> 00:36:46,130
Put your hands up.

615
00:36:46,266 --> 00:36:48,700
- Put them up.
- Oh, God.

616
00:36:50,203 --> 00:36:51,170
Give me your gun.

617
00:36:51,304 --> 00:36:51,998
I don't have a gun.

618
00:36:52,138 --> 00:36:53,628
They don't have guns. They're not armed.

619
00:36:53,773 --> 00:36:55,172
All right. 

620
00:36:55,308 --> 00:36:57,572
Put your hands down. Sit down.

621
00:36:57,711 --> 00:36:58,735
No, get up.

622
00:36:58,878 --> 00:37:01,506
- You fail to realise the jeopardy...
- Get over here. Shut up!

623
00:37:01,648 --> 00:37:02,342
We have got to talk about this.

624
00:37:02,482 --> 00:37:03,949
Shut up. Don't move.

625
00:37:05,685 --> 00:37:06,947
John, wait.

626
00:37:07,087 --> 00:37:10,648
Just stop. Stop! If you do this, 

627
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,781
you're on an irreversible course of action.

628
00:37:12,926 --> 00:37:14,791
Put on the brakes
and think about this.

629
00:37:14,928 --> 00:37:16,088
- We really need to talk.
- Mr Archibald, I hope...

630
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,562
- Back up, please.
- What?

631
00:37:19,532 --> 00:37:20,226
Do as he says.

632
00:37:20,366 --> 00:37:21,196
Would you please back up?

633
00:37:21,334 --> 00:37:22,164
What are you doing?

634
00:37:24,104 --> 00:37:25,833
I'm not taking no for an answer.

635
00:37:25,972 --> 00:37:27,132
- Back up.
- That guy's got a gun!

636
00:37:29,168 --> 00:37:30,449
Stay right there.

637
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,281
What are you doing? Get back over there.

638
00:37:38,418 --> 00:37:41,615
Sit on your hands over there!

639
00:37:42,355 --> 00:37:43,447
Get over there!

640
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,955
Turner, everybody, get down!

641
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:47,554
Sit on your hands!

642
00:37:48,027 --> 00:37:49,619
Put your hands under your butt!

643
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,390
Don't anybody move.

644
00:37:57,303 --> 00:37:58,497
What are you doing?

645
00:37:59,372 --> 00:38:03,399
I'm bleeding. Trying to get my goddamned finger sewn back on.

646
00:38:04,244 --> 00:38:07,179
Mr Archibald, these people have nothing to do with this.

647
00:38:07,313 --> 00:38:10,043
Let them go. They need treatment.

648
00:38:10,183 --> 00:38:13,778
This is a hospital. You're a doctor. Why don't you treat them? Start with him.

649
00:38:14,888 --> 00:38:16,150
What's the matter, Doctor?

650
00:38:16,623 --> 00:38:18,921
You want to see his insurance card first?

651
00:38:20,026 --> 00:38:20,993
I'll do it.

652
00:38:21,561 --> 00:38:22,721
Okay, you do it.

653
00:38:23,196 --> 00:38:25,721
Wait a minute. I got a pregnant wife here.

654
00:38:29,002 --> 00:38:31,300
Listen, all right, wait. Listen, everybody.

655
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:36,903
The hospital's under new management now.

656
00:38:39,078 --> 00:38:42,172
From now on, free health care for everybody. How's that?

657
00:38:42,315 --> 00:38:43,441
Righteous, man.

658
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:46,643
Don't have to squeeze it like... You crazy?

659
00:38:46,953 --> 00:38:48,045
What's your name?

660
00:38:48,188 --> 00:38:48,654
Max.

661
00:38:48,788 --> 00:38:50,983
You and Dr Turner come with me.

662
00:38:52,725 --> 00:38:53,919
- You got keys for that elevator?
- Yeah.

663
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,893
I want you to kill the power. Turn it off.

664
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,945
- Keep an eye on him, Max.
- 

665
00:39:19,652 --> 00:39:21,813
You got to sit still. I can't do this with you moving around.

666
00:39:21,955 --> 00:39:23,786
You remind me of Doogie Howser.

667
00:39:25,191 --> 00:39:27,182
We were here before the black guy.

668
00:39:27,627 --> 00:39:28,821
Everybody's going to get their turn.

669
00:39:28,962 --> 00:39:31,362
We're not going anywhere for a while, so just sit tight.

670
00:39:32,899 --> 00:39:34,799
Just relax, okay?

671
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,514
Is this Hope Memorial Hospital?

672
00:39:49,782 --> 00:39:51,613
Yeah, emergency room.

673
00:39:51,751 --> 00:39:54,447
Could you give me directions? I need to get over there.

674
00:39:54,587 --> 00:39:55,212
No, ma'am.

675
00:39:58,725 --> 00:40:00,693
We're closed for repairs right now. You're going to have to call...

676
00:40:00,827 --> 00:40:02,192
This is an emergency!

677
00:40:04,664 --> 00:40:06,427
Have you tried Mount Angel?

678
00:40:06,566 --> 00:40:08,261
No. That's too far. 

679
00:40:08,401 --> 00:40:10,460
My husband usually drives.

680
00:40:10,603 --> 00:40:12,468
I'm going to need directions.

681
00:40:12,605 --> 00:40:13,731
Which way are you coming from?

682
00:40:14,841 --> 00:40:17,071
Go down Flower, make a right turn,

683
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:19,542
go all the way to the end, make a left. You understand?

684
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:21,237
I'm asking you to do something.

685
00:40:21,381 --> 00:40:23,679
You're welcome. Miss, come from under there.

686
00:40:27,353 --> 00:40:29,287
Come from out of there. Come on out.

687
00:40:29,388 --> 00:40:31,297
What? No, what?

688
00:40:32,525 --> 00:40:33,719
Go sit over there.

689
00:40:35,695 --> 00:40:38,459
Unbelievable. This place is a joke.

690
00:40:38,932 --> 00:40:40,024
Good thing I'm not cut.

691
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:42,498
I'd bleed to death in this joint, am I right?

692
00:40:43,136 --> 00:40:44,160
Excuse me, brother man!

693
00:40:45,638 --> 00:40:48,573
No. You need to do something, Steve, all right?

694
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:50,903
You need to get your butt up!

695
00:40:51,044 --> 00:40:52,409
I want you to do something.

696
00:40:52,545 --> 00:40:53,375
Would you please sit down?

697
00:40:53,513 --> 00:40:54,445
I don't want to sit down!

698
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,877
What is wrong with you?

699
00:40:56,015 --> 00:40:59,644
Wait a minute.

700
00:40:59,786 --> 00:41:01,253
Relax. Don't have the baby yet.

701
00:41:01,387 --> 00:41:01,944
When is it due?

702
00:41:02,088 --> 00:41:02,747
Any minute.

703
00:41:02,889 --> 00:41:04,447
Don't have it.

704
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,420
I'm having it.

705
00:41:05,558 --> 00:41:06,650
Not yet. Hang on.

706
00:41:06,793 --> 00:41:07,623
Brother.

707
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,523
She's having a baby. Hang on a second.

708
00:41:09,662 --> 00:41:11,630
Excuse me, brother man.

709
00:41:11,764 --> 00:41:13,732
The woman's having a baby!

710
00:41:13,866 --> 00:41:14,992
When is she going to see a doctor?

711
00:41:15,134 --> 00:41:15,998
Sit down!

712
00:41:17,403 --> 00:41:18,165
Sit down!

713
00:41:18,304 --> 00:41:18,998
That's cool.

714
00:41:19,138 --> 00:41:20,196
Dr Klein!

715
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,705
I'll be there in a minute.

716
00:41:21,841 --> 00:41:23,741
You and me, we got no problems.

717
00:41:23,876 --> 00:41:28,973
That's right. Just stay in your seat.

718
00:41:31,317 --> 00:41:33,717
I don't understand what you're saying, ma'am.

719
00:41:36,155 --> 00:41:38,919
The ear? Ear infection?

720
00:41:39,592 --> 00:41:40,957
Can you help her with the ear infection?

721
00:41:41,094 --> 00:41:41,753
Me? 

722
00:41:42,795 --> 00:41:43,625
I can't.

723
00:41:43,763 --> 00:41:44,787
Why not?

724
00:41:45,064 --> 00:41:47,624
I don't know anything. It's my first day.

725
00:41:58,111 --> 00:41:59,806
Everybody, in the other room.

726
00:42:00,413 --> 00:42:03,007
Everybody, in the other room right now.

727
00:42:04,283 --> 00:42:06,410
They're going to take great care of you, I promise.

728
00:42:06,886 --> 00:42:08,444
What? Open up!

729
00:42:09,389 --> 00:42:10,413
It's dropping.

730
00:42:11,057 --> 00:42:12,547
We've got a gunshot victim out here.

731
00:42:12,692 --> 00:42:13,784
He's lost a lot of blood.

732
00:42:14,994 --> 00:42:16,894
Go to another hospital.

733
00:42:17,263 --> 00:42:18,491
Let's go. Open the door.

734
00:42:19,198 --> 00:42:19,960
You know these guys?

735
00:42:21,401 --> 00:42:22,265
You sure?

736
00:42:22,402 --> 00:42:23,596
They're here all the time.

737
00:42:23,936 --> 00:42:24,800
Open the door.

738
00:42:28,674 --> 00:42:29,538
Take your jacket off.

739
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:30,369
What?

740
00:42:32,011 --> 00:42:34,309
Open it up. Take it off.

741
00:42:35,415 --> 00:42:38,111
Put it on the ground. Walk away.

742
00:42:38,251 --> 00:42:40,082
Just leave him right there. Go!

743
00:42:41,587 --> 00:42:42,645
Just go.

744
00:42:45,792 --> 00:42:46,724
What's wrong with him?

745
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,752
He got shot.

746
00:42:55,243 --> 00:42:56,869
All right, come on.

747
00:43:08,181 --> 00:43:11,514
Wait a minute. I want to see what's in that bag.

748
00:43:13,553 --> 00:43:17,080
I gave them all the money in the register.

749
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:19,555
They shot me anyway.

750
00:43:19,692 --> 00:43:21,182
Jesus Christ.

751
00:43:21,561 --> 00:43:23,859
He needs to go into surgery right now.

752
00:43:23,996 --> 00:43:24,519
Can I take him to Trauma One?

753
00:43:24,664 --> 00:43:25,528
Thanks.

754
00:43:26,232 --> 00:43:27,290
What do we got?

755
00:43:27,433 --> 00:43:28,525
Gunshot wound to the belly.

756
00:43:28,901 --> 00:43:29,959
Anything from the EMTs?

757
00:43:30,103 --> 00:43:30,569
No. 

758
00:43:30,703 --> 00:43:32,261
Dr Turner, we're going to need your hand.

759
00:43:32,405 --> 00:43:33,372
I just bought this suit.

760
00:43:35,975 --> 00:43:36,771
Can you give me a hand?

761
00:43:36,909 --> 00:43:39,400
On three, two, one, lift.

762
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:40,270
Thank you.

763
00:43:42,882 --> 00:43:44,474
I can't handle a gut shot.

764
00:43:44,617 --> 00:43:46,812
I'm a cardiac surgeon, not an emergency room physician.

765
00:43:46,953 --> 00:43:48,978
It's like riding a bike, Doctor.

766
00:43:49,122 --> 00:43:50,453
Just pretend you're getting paid.

767
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:53,024
This is apples and oranges. I can't.

768
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:54,490
The man is dying. Help him.

769
00:43:54,627 --> 00:43:55,491
I'd like to. I haven't done this...

770
00:43:55,628 --> 00:43:56,686
Do it!

771
00:43:59,265 --> 00:44:01,165
75 milligrams Demerol I.V., lidocaine 2% local.

772
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,232
I'll scrub now.

773
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:07,498
When I get out of here, I'm suing this hospital and your security company.

774
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,870
What makes you so sure you're getting out at all?

775
00:44:21,455 --> 00:44:22,450
Right behind you!

776
00:44:22,889 --> 00:44:23,947
Here we go.

777
00:44:38,538 --> 00:44:39,971
You've got to stand behind the line, sir.

778
00:44:40,439 --> 00:44:44,170
Move this out of here for me, please? Thank you very much.

779
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:47,404
Lieutenant, we got a real problem here.

780
00:44:47,547 --> 00:44:48,070
What's that?

781
00:44:48,214 --> 00:44:49,772
This guy's in for the long haul...

782
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:51,178
locked down the E.R.,

783
00:44:51,317 --> 00:44:54,411
barricaded himself in, killed power in the elevators.

784
00:44:54,554 --> 00:44:57,546
We can bust down the door, but this son of a bitch might start killing people.

785
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:00,124
There's two pinpoint cameras hidden in the E.R.

786
00:45:00,259 --> 00:45:02,159
The hospital's own surveillance.

787
00:45:02,295 --> 00:45:03,421
We got a video tap being set up.

788
00:45:03,563 --> 00:45:04,495
Are you in charge of security?

789
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:07,724
No, that would be Wally Pitoniak. He's at home. It's his day off.

790
00:45:07,867 --> 00:45:10,267
Not anymore, it ain't. Get him here.

791
00:45:13,439 --> 00:45:14,565
All right, can you get me a secure line?

792
00:45:15,241 --> 00:45:17,368
We've got one of our guys inside. He's got a walkie-talkie.

793
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:19,774
You might want to try this.

794
00:45:20,479 --> 00:45:22,811
Put a clamp on all phone lines to the emergency room.

795
00:45:22,949 --> 00:45:25,383
If this guy picks up the phone, I want him talking to me.

796
00:45:25,518 --> 00:45:26,644
Done.

797
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:28,918
Who's in charge here?

798
00:45:29,055 --> 00:45:30,352
Rebecca Payne, sir.

799
00:45:30,623 --> 00:45:31,920
It's her day off, too.

800
00:45:32,058 --> 00:45:34,754
Jesus Christ, does anybody work at this hospital?

801
00:45:35,027 --> 00:45:36,051
It's Saturday, sir.

802
00:45:36,195 --> 00:45:37,184
So what?

803
00:45:37,863 --> 00:45:40,093
People get sick on Saturday, don't they?

804
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:47,706
Ser, no cry.

805
00:45:52,411 --> 00:45:55,312
Mr Archibald, I need to do an internal examination on her.

806
00:45:55,548 --> 00:45:56,606
Where you going to take her?

807
00:45:56,816 --> 00:45:57,942
Examination room there.

808
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:59,412
Good. Go.

809
00:46:07,727 --> 00:46:09,490
Just remember, it ain't your fault.

810
00:46:09,629 --> 00:46:10,561
Excuse me.

811
00:46:14,533 --> 00:46:16,728
I was wondering if we could get somebody to look at her.

812
00:46:16,869 --> 00:46:18,029
Sure. What happened?

813
00:46:18,838 --> 00:46:19,998
A drunk ran a red light...

814
00:46:20,139 --> 00:46:21,606
Ran a red light.He slammed into us.

815
00:46:21,741 --> 00:46:22,173
 Right?

816
00:46:23,376 --> 00:46:24,240
It was an accident.

817
00:46:24,377 --> 00:46:25,344
Yes, it was.

818
00:46:27,713 --> 00:46:29,180
This is the police depantment.

819
00:46:29,548 --> 00:46:31,846
I'm speaking to the man in charge.

820
00:46:31,984 --> 00:46:33,713
Please pick up the walkie-talkie.

821
00:46:34,787 --> 00:46:36,414
The building is surrounded.

822
00:46:36,555 --> 00:46:37,647
There's no way in or out.

823
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:40,418
If you hear me. I advise you to respond.

824
00:46:43,496 --> 00:46:45,191
Hello. Is anyone there?

825
00:46:48,334 --> 00:46:51,497
This is Lieutenant Frank Grimes of the Chicago Police Department.

826
00:46:51,871 --> 00:46:53,361
Are you the man in charge?

827
00:46:56,008 --> 00:46:57,100
That's right.

828
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:58,772
Who am I speaking to?

829
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,206
John...

830
00:47:04,083 --> 00:47:05,141
Q.

831
00:47:07,053 --> 00:47:08,953
All right, John Q.

832
00:47:09,889 --> 00:47:12,016
Again, I'm Lieutenant Grimes,

833
00:47:12,158 --> 00:47:14,058
but I want you to call me Frank. Can you do that?

834
00:47:14,193 --> 00:47:15,251
Sure, Frank.

835
00:47:15,561 --> 00:47:17,051
I'll be the hostage negotiator.

836
00:47:17,196 --> 00:47:20,188
I've been a cop for 35 years. This is all I do.

837
00:47:20,499 --> 00:47:22,126
I don't play games. I don't fool around.

838
00:47:22,268 --> 00:47:25,362
If I say something, you can take it to the bank.

839
00:47:25,671 --> 00:47:26,865
Let's get down to it.

840
00:47:27,707 --> 00:47:29,004
Is anybody hurt?

841
00:47:29,775 --> 00:47:31,841
It's an emergency room. Everybody's hurt.

842
00:47:31,941 --> 00:47:33,020
Right.

843
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:34,137
They're fine.

844
00:47:34,413 --> 00:47:34,936
Good.

845
00:47:35,081 --> 00:47:37,811
As long as it stays that way, we can keep talking.

846
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:39,679
What is it you want?

847
00:47:40,052 --> 00:47:42,179
Find Rebecca Payne, 

848
00:47:42,321 --> 00:47:44,414
Hope Memorial's  Administrative Supervisor.

849
00:47:44,557 --> 00:47:45,751
You find her. 

850
00:47:45,891 --> 00:47:49,554
Tell her I want my kid's name on the donors' list.

851
00:47:52,765 --> 00:47:53,595
Kid boy or girl?

852
00:47:53,733 --> 00:47:54,722
A boy.

853
00:47:55,067 --> 00:47:56,898
I got two boys myself.

854
00:47:57,770 --> 00:47:59,431
Two girls and two boys.

855
00:48:01,774 --> 00:48:03,264
Don't handle me. I don't want to be handled.

856
00:48:03,409 --> 00:48:06,105
It insults my intelligence as a human being!

857
00:48:06,245 --> 00:48:09,874
Take it easy. The idea is not to get too excited, all right?

858
00:48:10,149 --> 00:48:12,242
I'm going to take it any way I can get it, understand?

859
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:14,677
If I don't get it, 

860
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:15,946
there's going to be some dead bodies on your hands in here.

861
00:48:17,857 --> 00:48:22,055
I hear you loud and clear. I'm going to jot that down.

862
00:48:22,194 --> 00:48:23,024
Rebecca Payne, right?

863
00:48:23,162 --> 00:48:23,821
All right.

864
00:48:24,997 --> 00:48:27,090
There's a lot of cops out here, John.

865
00:48:28,734 --> 00:48:30,497
Are you sure you want to go through with this?

866
00:48:30,636 --> 00:48:31,864
I'm sure.

867
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:34,938
All right, sit tight.

868
00:48:35,174 --> 00:48:37,506
You're in a tough spot, a lot of trouble.

869
00:48:37,643 --> 00:48:39,406
If you work with me, if you're reasonable,

870
00:48:39,545 --> 00:48:41,445
we'll figure a way out of this, okay?

871
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,276
We have to have a little faith in one another.

872
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:45,278
Why is that, Frank?

873
00:48:45,418 --> 00:48:46,544
Why?

874
00:48:47,586 --> 00:48:49,554
Because that's what faith's all about...

875
00:48:49,822 --> 00:48:52,256
believing when you don't want to believe.

876
00:48:53,025 --> 00:48:55,220
Besides, what else are you going to do?

877
00:48:58,264 --> 00:48:59,356
I want my epidural.

878
00:48:59,498 --> 00:49:00,396
Too late for that.

879
00:49:00,533 --> 00:49:01,522
Something for the pain.

880
00:49:01,667 --> 00:49:02,759
Out! 

881
00:49:02,902 --> 00:49:04,199
She'll be fine. 

882
00:49:14,346 --> 00:49:15,540
First child?

883
00:49:15,748 --> 00:49:17,409
Yeah.

884
00:49:18,818 --> 00:49:20,547
Just kind of nervous. You know how it is.

885
00:49:20,686 --> 00:49:22,415
I was, too. What do you want,

886
00:49:22,988 --> 00:49:24,319
a boy or a girl?

887
00:49:24,457 --> 00:49:25,617
Doesn't matter to me, man,

888
00:49:25,758 --> 00:49:27,589
as long as my kid's healthy.

889
00:49:28,461 --> 00:49:30,088
That's all I want.

890
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:37,500
Listen, I didn't mean anything by that.

891
00:49:44,543 --> 00:49:46,101
Who was driving? 

892
00:49:46,612 --> 00:49:48,170
The car... who was driving?

893
00:49:48,414 --> 00:49:49,506
I was. 

894
00:49:50,483 --> 00:49:52,144
What's that got to do with anything?

895
00:49:52,284 --> 00:49:54,650
Why is your girl all banged up and you're not?

896
00:49:58,123 --> 00:49:59,818
What do you call this?

897
00:50:00,759 --> 00:50:01,555
What are you laughing at?

898
00:50:01,694 --> 00:50:04,026
Somebody get this fool a Band-Aid.

899
00:50:04,163 --> 00:50:06,188
I don't want you to bleed to death.

900
00:50:07,132 --> 00:50:08,599
Screw you. That shit hurts.

901
00:50:09,802 --> 00:50:12,635
His air bag went off and mine didn't.

902
00:50:13,105 --> 00:50:14,003
What kind of car you drive?

903
00:50:14,139 --> 00:50:15,163
Mercedes 500.

904
00:50:15,307 --> 00:50:17,275
You drive a Mercedes 500?

905
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:19,108
What year?

906
00:50:19,245 --> 00:50:20,940
1986. 

907
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,879
It's a classic.

908
00:50:23,349 --> 00:50:26,477
Mercedes didn't make

909
00:50:26,619 --> 00:50:28,177
passenger-side air bags till 1988.

910
00:50:29,855 --> 00:50:30,981
Busted.

911
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:32,086
What's your point, John?

912
00:50:32,224 --> 00:50:33,384
What's yours, Mitch?

913
00:50:33,759 --> 00:50:35,750
You from the Slap-a-Ho tribe.

914
00:50:35,895 --> 00:50:37,590
You like to beat on that young lady,

915
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,925
and everybody here knows it.

916
00:50:44,603 --> 00:50:46,434
I was drunk, all right?

917
00:50:57,816 --> 00:50:59,215
Don't smoke in here, Mitch.

918
00:50:59,451 --> 00:51:02,318
Give me a break. Work with me here.

919
00:51:02,721 --> 00:51:04,348
I'm trying my best.

920
00:51:04,523 --> 00:51:06,582
Mr Q, could I get some water?

921
00:51:07,026 --> 00:51:08,584
I need to tinkle.

922
00:51:08,961 --> 00:51:10,895
I got missed-meal cramps.

923
00:51:11,263 --> 00:51:13,993
I'm hungry. Let's get a bucket of chicken or something.

924
00:51:14,133 --> 00:51:16,101
In a minute.

925
00:51:16,235 --> 00:51:17,202
How's it going in there?

926
00:51:18,404 --> 00:51:19,393
He's going to make it.

927
00:51:19,538 --> 00:51:21,665
You have any idea how much blood this guy lost? 

928
00:51:21,941 --> 00:51:24,637
It's incredible. He saved this man's life.

929
00:51:38,557 --> 00:51:39,615
What's that?

930
00:51:39,758 --> 00:51:40,747
Lasix.

931
00:51:41,026 --> 00:51:43,893
It's a diuretic to help get rid of some of the fluid build-up.

932
00:51:44,196 --> 00:51:47,597
It's potassium-depleting, so he needs this one to supplement.

933
00:51:48,233 --> 00:51:49,200
And those?

934
00:51:49,768 --> 00:51:52,202
Dopamine for his blood pressure,

935
00:51:52,338 --> 00:51:54,670
Dig for his heart, Primacor.

936
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:56,703
It seems like so much.

937
00:51:56,842 --> 00:51:59,436
Yeah, it's a lot. This is antibiotic.

938
00:51:59,578 --> 00:52:00,567
What for?

939
00:52:00,879 --> 00:52:03,712
It's prophylactic, just in case.

940
00:52:07,553 --> 00:52:08,042
And those?

941
00:52:08,187 --> 00:52:11,213
These two? They're for pain.

942
00:52:11,957 --> 00:52:14,118
I don't feel so good.

943
00:52:14,259 --> 00:52:16,921
This is going to make you feel yucky for a few minutes, buddy.

944
00:52:17,663 --> 00:52:20,757
I'm going to get you some of those crunchy ice chips you want.

945
00:52:20,899 --> 00:52:22,594
How does that sound?

946
00:52:23,702 --> 00:52:25,135
Mike, by the way, 

947
00:52:25,604 --> 00:52:28,004
there was this guy, he stopped by to see you. 

948
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,607
He said he was a friend of yours.

949
00:52:30,376 --> 00:52:32,344
I got him right here.

950
00:52:32,678 --> 00:52:35,238
I didn't know if I should let him in.

951
00:52:35,381 --> 00:52:36,313
What do you think?

952
00:52:36,448 --> 00:52:37,813
- He's okay.
- He's okay?

953
00:52:38,083 --> 00:52:39,914
Said he wanted to hang out with you.

954
00:52:40,185 --> 00:52:41,345
He's okay.

955
00:52:41,487 --> 00:52:42,920
That's great.

956
00:52:44,823 --> 00:52:45,949
Thank you.

957
00:53:02,775 --> 00:53:04,675
Oh, my baby!

958
00:53:05,511 --> 00:53:07,342
Let me hold my baby!

959
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:12,142
Mom? 

960
00:53:12,851 --> 00:53:14,546
Is Dad coming?

961
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:17,288
Yeah, he's coming.

962
00:53:17,456 --> 00:53:21,017
When? Where is he?

963
00:53:22,528 --> 00:53:23,859
I don't know, 

964
00:53:24,496 --> 00:53:26,020
but he's coming.

965
00:53:36,742 --> 00:53:38,004
What are you up to?

966
00:53:38,143 --> 00:53:40,077
Never mind me. You're worthless. Some security guard.

967
00:53:40,345 --> 00:53:43,439
You should have zapped the bastard when you had the chance.

968
00:53:43,582 --> 00:53:45,209
With what? 

969
00:53:45,451 --> 00:53:47,783
Besides, I'm not sticking my neck on the line for $8.50 an hour.

970
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,945
Pay dirt.

971
00:53:59,465 --> 00:54:00,796
Are you nuts?

972
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,394
What the hell are you doing?

973
00:54:02,534 --> 00:54:03,865
Looking out for number one.

974
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:07,930
You want to stay alive, sit tight and wait for the cavalry to get here.

975
00:54:08,073 --> 00:54:10,701
The cops are coming in shooting. 

976
00:54:10,843 --> 00:54:12,470
They don't care about his kid.

977
00:54:12,611 --> 00:54:14,101
Once he realises that, 

978
00:54:15,214 --> 00:54:16,442
we're all history.

979
00:54:16,815 --> 00:54:19,750
If he catches you with that scalpel, you're the one that's history, asshole.

980
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:22,918
He don't look so bad to me.

981
00:54:23,188 --> 00:54:25,122
"Ethyl chloride." Just like mace.

982
00:54:25,257 --> 00:54:28,090
Put that stuff back before you get us in trouble.

983
00:54:28,227 --> 00:54:30,024
You listen, you stupid rent-a-cop.

984
00:54:30,162 --> 00:54:31,322
I am not a slob.

985
00:54:32,131 --> 00:54:35,328
I have a life. It means something to me.

986
00:54:35,601 --> 00:54:38,536
I'm not going down in this shit-hole. No, sir.

987
00:54:47,379 --> 00:54:49,108
How are you? How you all doing?

988
00:54:49,648 --> 00:54:51,707
Good. How are you?

989
00:54:52,184 --> 00:54:53,515
How are you, fellows?

990
00:54:54,953 --> 00:54:56,443
Is it true the man inside wants an operation for his son?

991
00:54:56,588 --> 00:54:57,748
Everything good? Good to see you.

992
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:01,553
- Do you know what weapon he has?
- You'll talk to me, right?

993
00:55:01,693 --> 00:55:03,285
I'll let you know when I know, okay?

994
00:55:03,428 --> 00:55:04,952
You'll be the first.

995
00:55:05,097 --> 00:55:07,429
I'll let you know later.

996
00:55:07,566 --> 00:55:08,760
Gus, how are you?

997
00:55:08,901 --> 00:55:10,300
How you doing, Frank? It's hot.

998
00:55:10,435 --> 00:55:10,958
Yeah, it is.

999
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:13,665
A little early for heavy artillery, isn't it?

1000
00:55:13,806 --> 00:55:15,774
Maybe. Maybe not.

1001
00:55:16,441 --> 00:55:17,430
You should tell me. What's going on?

1002
00:55:17,709 --> 00:55:18,971
You're looking at it.

1003
00:55:19,178 --> 00:55:20,975
A very upset father inside. 

1004
00:55:21,113 --> 00:55:23,707
We'll give him a couple of minutes to cool off.

1005
00:55:27,853 --> 00:55:29,286
Let's not give him too much time.

1006
00:55:29,555 --> 00:55:31,955
Let's end this quick and quiet.

1007
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:33,114
That's the plan.

1008
00:55:33,258 --> 00:55:34,748
All right. Good.

1009
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,751
In that case, I'm just here to lend my support in any way that I can.

1010
00:55:37,896 --> 00:55:41,024
I don't need a babysitter on this. It's under control.

1011
00:55:41,166 --> 00:55:41,564
Is it?

1012
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:42,189
Yes.

1013
00:55:42,334 --> 00:55:43,062
All right. 

1014
00:55:43,602 --> 00:55:46,298
Can't have people running around the street using guns.

1015
00:55:46,939 --> 00:55:48,998
Makes it look like the city's unsafe.

1016
00:55:50,209 --> 00:55:51,801
Besides, I got to be here.

1017
00:55:52,344 --> 00:55:54,744
Chief doesn't show up, looks like he's asleep at the wheel.

1018
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,609
Just stay out of my way.

1019
00:55:56,748 --> 00:55:58,010
The TV cameras are over there.

1020
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:00,243
They should make you feel right at home.

1021
00:56:00,385 --> 00:56:01,443
Right. 

1022
00:56:01,787 --> 00:56:03,049
Why don't you just relax?

1023
00:56:04,957 --> 00:56:06,584
Why can't you relax?

1024
00:56:06,725 --> 00:56:07,316
I'm fine.

1025
00:56:07,459 --> 00:56:09,586
Why don't you just do your job?

1026
00:56:09,728 --> 00:56:10,456
I'm doing my job.

1027
00:56:10,596 --> 00:56:11,563
We're both cops, right?

1028
00:56:11,697 --> 00:56:12,755
We're on the same side, remember?

1029
00:56:12,898 --> 00:56:14,695
- Right.
- Right?

1030
00:56:16,435 --> 00:56:18,733
It's good to see you. Thanks.

1031
00:56:19,171 --> 00:56:21,662
Yes, Mr Mayor. 

1032
00:56:21,807 --> 00:56:22,796
I'll see you in a little bit.

1033
00:56:23,408 --> 00:56:25,433
No, we got it. I got it.

1034
00:56:26,353 --> 00:56:27,634
How are you?

1035
00:56:27,846 --> 00:56:28,972
The old man, looking for his Depends.

1036
00:56:29,114 --> 00:56:30,547
He leave them over here?

1037
00:56:42,227 --> 00:56:44,286
What I don't understand is why they never found it, the doctors.

1038
00:56:44,429 --> 00:56:48,559
My son has had clean checkups every year since the day he was born.

1039
00:56:48,834 --> 00:56:50,699
How could the doctors not pick it up?

1040
00:56:50,836 --> 00:56:52,963
He might not have been tested enough.

1041
00:56:53,105 --> 00:56:54,163
Why not?

1042
00:56:57,876 --> 00:56:59,673
You got an HMO, right?

1043
00:57:00,445 --> 00:57:01,412
There's your answer.

1044
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:05,043
HMOs pay their doctors not to test.

1045
00:57:05,684 --> 00:57:07,447
It's their way of keeping costs down.

1046
00:57:07,586 --> 00:57:10,612
Say Mike did need additional testing

1047
00:57:10,756 --> 00:57:12,917
and insurance says they won't cover them.

1048
00:57:13,058 --> 00:57:13,888
The doctor keeps his mouth shut,

1049
00:57:14,026 --> 00:57:14,924
and come Christmas,

1050
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,290
the HMO sends the doctor a fat-ass bonus cheque.

1051
00:57:17,562 --> 00:57:18,620
Is that true?

1052
00:57:18,931 --> 00:57:19,989
Possible. 

1053
00:57:20,632 --> 00:57:22,327
Not likely, but possible.

1054
00:57:22,467 --> 00:57:25,197
These doctors may have known what was wrong with my son,

1055
00:57:25,337 --> 00:57:27,532
and they could have treated him all along?

1056
00:57:27,773 --> 00:57:29,570
Who knows? I don't know.

1057
00:57:30,175 --> 00:57:31,938
Don't take this personal, Doc.

1058
00:57:32,177 --> 00:57:33,838
You're a bunch of crooks.

1059
00:57:33,979 --> 00:57:35,105
You don't know what you're talking about.

1060
00:57:35,247 --> 00:57:37,340
What about that thing you take?

1061
00:57:37,482 --> 00:57:38,107
The thing?

1062
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:39,581
That promise.

1063
00:57:39,718 --> 00:57:41,242
It's called the Hippocratic Oath.

1064
00:57:41,386 --> 00:57:44,219
More like the hypocritical oath.

1065
00:57:44,356 --> 00:57:45,914
How's it go, Doc?

1066
00:57:46,058 --> 00:57:47,992
"I solemnly swear to take care

1067
00:57:48,126 --> 00:57:50,424
of the sick and damn-near-dying,

1068
00:57:50,562 --> 00:57:51,494
unless they ain't got major medical."

1069
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:52,255
Something like that?

1070
00:57:52,397 --> 00:57:53,455
You've got it perfectly.

1071
00:57:53,598 --> 00:57:55,793
It's funny, but it's not far from the truth.

1072
00:57:55,934 --> 00:57:57,492
This shit happens all the time.

1073
00:57:57,636 --> 00:57:59,627
Paramedics bring in some accident victim.

1074
00:57:59,771 --> 00:58:01,739
When the boys in Accounting find out they can't pay, 

1075
00:58:01,873 --> 00:58:03,397
they send them packing.

1076
00:58:03,542 --> 00:58:04,839
Hospitals can't turn people away.

1077
00:58:04,977 --> 00:58:05,944
Isn't there laws against that?

1078
00:58:06,078 --> 00:58:08,376
There's also ways around those laws.

1079
00:58:08,513 --> 00:58:10,105
We have to stabilise them.

1080
00:58:10,248 --> 00:58:12,512
After that, we're off the hook.

1081
00:58:12,651 --> 00:58:13,379
That's not how it works.

1082
00:58:13,518 --> 00:58:15,213
That's exactly how it works.

1083
00:58:15,354 --> 00:58:17,845
Maybe not on the fifth floor, but in here

1084
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:18,888
if you don't have money,

1085
00:58:19,024 --> 00:58:21,618
you get a Band-Aid, a foot in the ass, and you're out the door.

1086
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,318
Enough already. 

1087
00:58:23,562 --> 00:58:26,429
I've heard all the bitching and moaning I can stand for one day. 

1088
00:58:26,665 --> 00:58:29,998
If you all want to regard me as some kind of blood-sucking vampire, great.

1089
00:58:30,135 --> 00:58:31,693
I'll be the bad guy. 

1090
00:58:32,804 --> 00:58:34,863
But who's holding the fucking gun?

1091
00:58:42,948 --> 00:58:43,812
Sir? 

1092
00:58:44,316 --> 00:58:45,283
Lieutenant!

1093
00:58:50,756 --> 00:58:52,656
This is Frank Grimes.

1094
00:58:52,891 --> 00:58:54,017
You pick up the phone,

1095
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:56,286
you get me.

1096
00:58:56,995 --> 00:58:58,553
What can I do for you?

1097
00:58:58,964 --> 00:59:00,864
What's going on with the list?

1098
00:59:01,066 --> 00:59:03,159
I'm working on it, but I need time.

1099
00:59:03,301 --> 00:59:04,928
Time I don't have.

1100
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:06,731
Let's talk about the hostages.

1101
00:59:06,872 --> 00:59:08,601
What do you want to know?

1102
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:10,867
What's going on? How are they?

1103
00:59:11,209 --> 00:59:12,073
They're fine. They're full.

1104
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:15,304
We're eating candy bars and discussing HMOs, 

1105
00:59:15,447 --> 00:59:16,675
waiting for you.

1106
00:59:17,082 --> 00:59:18,879
I want you to let some of them go.

1107
00:59:19,017 --> 00:59:19,881
For what?

1108
00:59:20,018 --> 00:59:22,680
I do for you, you do for me. Show some good faith.

1109
00:59:22,821 --> 00:59:24,789
A lot of nervous people out here.

1110
00:59:24,923 --> 00:59:26,584
Make everybody breathe a lot easier

1111
00:59:26,725 --> 00:59:28,454
if we saw some happy faces.

1112
00:59:28,593 --> 00:59:31,027
I'll do for you when you start doing for me.

1113
00:59:31,163 --> 00:59:33,563
I want my kid's name on that list.

1114
00:59:33,698 --> 00:59:34,858
I'm not kidding around here.

1115
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:35,967
Good faith.

1116
00:59:36,101 --> 00:59:37,693
Good faith only takes you so far...

1117
00:59:37,836 --> 00:59:40,737
What's that?

1118
00:59:40,872 --> 00:59:42,339
...merit system. So far, you haven't earned any points.

1119
00:59:42,474 --> 00:59:43,702
Excuse me. I need to talk to you.

1120
00:59:44,509 --> 00:59:47,000
This woman is six centimetres dilated. The baby is breeched.

1121
00:59:47,145 --> 00:59:50,672
I've medicated her, but we have to move her up to Maternity immediately.

1122
00:59:51,783 --> 00:59:52,681
Hang on, Frank.

1123
00:59:52,918 --> 00:59:53,680
Right down here.

1124
00:59:55,587 --> 00:59:56,918
What the hell is going on?

1125
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,113
Do you know this man?

1126
01:00:01,393 --> 01:00:04,123
His name is John Archibald. He has a son here in ICU.

1127
01:00:04,262 --> 01:00:07,231
Put people on the door. Find the mother. I need to talk to her.

1128
01:00:07,365 --> 01:00:08,195
Are you there, Frank?

1129
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:09,925
I'm here, John.

1130
01:00:10,068 --> 01:00:11,194
I changed my mind, all right?

1131
01:00:12,571 --> 01:00:14,061
I'm going to let some of the hostages go.

1132
01:00:14,206 --> 01:00:15,673
That's the right thing.

1133
01:00:15,807 --> 01:00:17,798
But when I do, 

1134
01:00:17,943 --> 01:00:19,706
the clock starts, you understand?

1135
01:00:20,112 --> 01:00:21,773
It's 4:15. You got one hour.

1136
01:00:22,114 --> 01:00:25,083
You got till 5:15, you understand?

1137
01:00:25,217 --> 01:00:27,708
If my boy's not on that list by 5:15,

1138
01:00:27,853 --> 01:00:29,150
somebody in here is going to die.

1139
01:00:29,287 --> 01:00:30,254
Don't be stupid.

1140
01:00:30,388 --> 01:00:31,446
5:15, Frank!

1141
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:35,151
5-1-5, something happens for me!

1142
01:00:35,293 --> 01:00:36,021
Got it.

1143
01:00:36,161 --> 01:00:37,628
You're a cop. Call the coroner.

1144
01:00:39,798 --> 01:00:41,390
This is bad, Frank.

1145
01:00:41,867 --> 01:00:44,028
This has just got to go away.

1146
01:00:46,905 --> 01:00:49,305
All right, Miriam...

1147
01:00:52,544 --> 01:00:52,942
And Rosa. Vamos.

1148
01:00:53,645 --> 01:00:54,373
Let's go.

1149
01:00:54,513 --> 01:00:56,413
Mr Archibald,

1150
01:00:57,516 --> 01:00:59,040
please let my husband come with me.

1151
01:00:59,184 --> 01:01:01,948
I need you to get out of here. I will be okay. Just go.

1152
01:01:02,087 --> 01:01:04,851
Shit, I'll go. I'm free.

1153
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:05,513
Steve, baby, no, please.

1154
01:01:05,657 --> 01:01:06,749
What kind of man are you?

1155
01:01:06,892 --> 01:01:08,359
Screw you, Tyrone.

1156
01:01:08,493 --> 01:01:11,018
What? Screw me, Tyrone?

1157
01:01:12,264 --> 01:01:13,754
Wait a second. Wait a minute. Just relax.

1158
01:01:18,904 --> 01:01:20,462
That's right, tough guy.

1159
01:01:26,578 --> 01:01:28,170
Julie, baby. Get the gun! Come on!

1160
01:01:30,048 --> 01:01:31,208
Go over there and pick up that gun.

1161
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:34,110
Shoot him! Shoot him right in the face, Julie!

1162
01:01:34,386 --> 01:01:36,650
Get up! Get the gun!

1163
01:01:36,788 --> 01:01:38,449
There you go, baby.

1164
01:01:39,591 --> 01:01:41,616
What are you... are you crazy?

1165
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,387
What are you doing?

1166
01:01:43,528 --> 01:01:44,961
Come on now!

1167
01:01:47,399 --> 01:01:48,696
Max, you got cuffs?

1168
01:01:50,202 --> 01:01:51,294
Oh, God!

1169
01:01:54,873 --> 01:01:56,773
You stupid bitch!

1170
01:01:57,275 --> 01:01:59,573
That's for beating the shit out of me!

1171
01:02:02,247 --> 01:02:05,614
And that's for being an asshole!

1172
01:02:10,455 --> 01:02:11,285
And this,

1173
01:02:11,656 --> 01:02:13,453
this is for calling me a bitch!

1174
01:02:15,927 --> 01:02:17,360
I felt that one.

1175
01:02:18,663 --> 01:02:21,496
And I'm not going to be \your Barbie anymore!

1176
01:02:24,035 --> 01:02:25,366
Goddamn! 

1177
01:02:25,503 --> 01:02:26,765
All that ass and muscles to go with it. 

1178
01:02:26,905 --> 01:02:30,136
- I knew damn well you wasn't no blonde.
- Give them to me.

1179
01:02:31,587 --> 01:02:33,672
Mitch! Look at me!

1180
01:02:39,251 --> 01:02:40,081
Come here.

1181
01:02:52,464 --> 01:02:54,227
Let's go, both of you.

1182
01:02:56,768 --> 01:02:57,860
Whatever happens

1183
01:02:58,003 --> 01:02:59,903
I want you to know everything's going to be okay.

1184
01:03:00,038 --> 01:03:00,697
You understand me?

1185
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:01,806
Yes.

1186
01:03:02,907 --> 01:03:03,498
Don't worry.

1187
01:03:04,909 --> 01:03:06,240
Don't worry about anything.

1188
01:03:06,378 --> 01:03:08,608
I'll always be there for you, baby.

1189
01:03:11,616 --> 01:03:12,605
Don't shoot!

1190
01:03:17,455 --> 01:03:20,549
I'm letting some hostages go! Don't shoot!

1191
01:03:22,227 --> 01:03:23,888
All right, Steve. You, too.

1192
01:03:24,829 --> 01:03:26,729
Let's go, both of you.

1193
01:03:27,098 --> 01:03:29,396
Thank you. Muchas gracias. Sir.

1194
01:03:31,536 --> 01:03:33,697
- Thank you, Mr Archibald.
- You, too.

1195
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,735
Take care of his ear.

1196
01:03:36,875 --> 01:03:39,435
The gunman has just freed several hostages.

1197
01:03:39,577 --> 01:03:43,172
by members of the crisis team.

1198
01:03:43,315 --> 01:03:46,682
Will the man known as John Q get a heant for his little boy?

1199
01:03:46,818 --> 01:03:50,379
Only time will tell.From Hope Memorial Hospital. I'm Tuck Lampley.

1200
01:03:50,522 --> 01:03:52,683
Is it true an ambulance dropped off

1201
01:03:52,824 --> 01:03:55,258
a victim after the gunman took over?

1202
01:03:55,393 --> 01:03:57,588
He unlocked the door and he let him inside!

1203
01:03:57,729 --> 01:03:59,094
Can you comment?

1204
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:00,458
The man was critically injured.

1205
01:04:00,598 --> 01:04:02,532
If he hadn't let him in, he would have died.

1206
01:04:02,667 --> 01:04:03,998
Ma'am, are you all right?

1207
01:04:04,402 --> 01:04:07,132
I feel good. We're having a baby!

1208
01:04:07,272 --> 01:04:10,105
Ma'am, any comments about the gunman?

1209
01:04:10,241 --> 01:04:12,368
John Q very good man.

1210
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:13,499
The gunman?

1211
01:04:13,645 --> 01:04:15,613
Very good man!

1212
01:04:25,657 --> 01:04:26,453
They got a camera.

1213
01:04:26,591 --> 01:04:28,286
They're watching a video feed.

1214
01:04:28,426 --> 01:04:29,051
How do you know?

1215
01:04:29,194 --> 01:04:31,458
They're looking at something.

1216
01:04:31,596 --> 01:04:32,426
I want to know what. Can you get it?

1217
01:04:32,564 --> 01:04:35,089
Boss, if they got it, I can get it.

1218
01:04:35,433 --> 01:04:38,334
You give in, there's going to be guns in every hospital in the country.

1219
01:04:38,636 --> 01:04:41,434
You think Mr Archibald's the only one who has a sick child?

1220
01:04:41,573 --> 01:04:44,269
Have you checked the HIV ward? There's a whole floor full.

1221
01:04:44,776 --> 01:04:47,768
People get sick. They die. That's the way it goes.

1222
01:04:47,912 --> 01:04:50,142
I'm faced with decisions like this every day.

1223
01:04:50,281 --> 01:04:52,841
There's a man threatening innocent people 

1224
01:04:52,984 --> 01:04:54,884
because you refused to help his son.

1225
01:04:55,019 --> 01:04:59,217
There are 50 million people in this country 

1226
01:04:59,491 --> 01:05:00,651
without medical insurance.

1227
01:05:00,792 --> 01:05:02,191
If you'd like to change it, call your congressman.

1228
01:05:02,327 --> 01:05:03,157
Excuse me. 

1229
01:05:03,828 --> 01:05:06,296
Why don't we just tell him his son's name's on the list?

1230
01:05:06,431 --> 01:05:07,921
Doesn't that make sense?

1231
01:05:09,134 --> 01:05:10,726
How's he going to know, anyway?

1232
01:05:13,171 --> 01:05:16,607
Sir? Pardon me. Can you come take a look at this?

1233
01:05:20,812 --> 01:05:23,076
Sarge, Chief Moroe, this is Wally Pitoniak, head of security.

1234
01:05:23,848 --> 01:05:24,439
Nice to meet you.

1235
01:05:24,582 --> 01:05:26,049
I got your spot.

1236
01:05:26,584 --> 01:05:27,778
Here's your sight.

1237
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:31,751
That's going to be your perch.

1238
01:05:32,223 --> 01:05:33,349
The X there, that's your phone.

1239
01:05:34,526 --> 01:05:35,356
Which phone?

1240
01:05:35,493 --> 01:05:36,425
Bring it up, Jeff.

1241
01:05:39,864 --> 01:05:41,456
The phone right there.

1242
01:05:45,336 --> 01:05:48,203
It is. Tom. But Chief Moroe maintains the police will do whatever is necessary

1243
01:05:48,339 --> 01:05:51,414
to preserve the lives and safety of these hostages.

1244
01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:52,143
Thanks. Tuck.

1245
01:05:52,243 --> 01:05:53,232
This country, man.

1246
01:05:53,378 --> 01:05:55,175
Can't go anywhere anymore without

1247
01:05:55,313 --> 01:05:58,840
getting mugged or murdered or stabbed.

1248
01:05:58,983 --> 01:06:01,281
Kids killing their classmates. Drive-bys.

1249
01:06:01,419 --> 01:06:03,853
I won't even go into a post office.

1250
01:06:03,988 --> 01:06:05,216
Shut up, Mitch.

1251
01:06:05,356 --> 01:06:06,323
You shut up.

1252
01:06:06,624 --> 01:06:08,319
I hate the little bastard, but he's right.

1253
01:06:08,726 --> 01:06:09,818
You know how easy it is to get a gun?

1254
01:06:09,961 --> 01:06:11,895
Five minutes. Gun show.

1255
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:14,261
I understand your kid is sick, John,

1256
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:16,924
but what makes him better than me? I got a life, too.

1257
01:06:17,168 --> 01:06:18,499
But you got insurance.

1258
01:06:18,636 --> 01:06:22,128
So what, are you going to shoot me? That's what you're telling the cops.

1259
01:06:22,273 --> 01:06:24,764
If your son doesn't get the very first heart available, 

1260
01:06:24,909 --> 01:06:26,035
we all die.

1261
01:06:27,946 --> 01:06:29,937
How's it going to end, John?

1262
01:06:30,181 --> 01:06:31,409
What's your move?

1263
01:06:32,283 --> 01:06:35,548
I got no moves, okay? I don't know what I'm going to do.

1264
01:06:38,857 --> 01:06:41,155
I'm waiting on a miracle, okay?

1265
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:44,590
I'm waiting on an act of God.

1266
01:07:12,624 --> 01:07:14,615
Could we have a word with you, please?

1267
01:07:17,695 --> 01:07:19,219
This is all my fault.

1268
01:07:19,364 --> 01:07:21,594
When the hospital told me they were releasing Mikey,

1269
01:07:21,733 --> 01:07:23,633
I called John and yelled at him,

1270
01:07:23,768 --> 01:07:25,998
told him to do something, anything.

1271
01:07:26,137 --> 01:07:28,731
But I never thought...

1272
01:07:28,873 --> 01:07:29,999
I understand.

1273
01:07:30,141 --> 01:07:32,371
Is he a violent man, Mrs Archibald?

1274
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:37,445
No! He's sweet and gentle.

1275
01:07:37,916 --> 01:07:39,178
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

1276
01:07:39,317 --> 01:07:42,252
That's not what he's saying.

1277
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,920
He's talking about killing people.

1278
01:07:45,056 --> 01:07:49,288
I may be fishing, but has he spent time in the military or anything like that?

1279
01:07:51,396 --> 01:07:52,226
What is this?

1280
01:07:52,363 --> 01:07:53,387
What?

1281
01:07:54,465 --> 01:07:56,365
I see what's going on here.

1282
01:07:58,169 --> 01:08:00,364
You're trying to get me to say something

1283
01:08:00,505 --> 01:08:02,166
you can use against my husband.

1284
01:08:02,307 --> 01:08:03,535
He's in a lot of trouble.

1285
01:08:03,675 --> 01:08:05,609
We're going to need you to talk to him.

1286
01:08:05,743 --> 01:08:07,938
Let's get something straight, mister.

1287
01:08:08,346 --> 01:08:11,804
You cannot use me to build a case against my husband.

1288
01:08:11,950 --> 01:08:14,350
I support him in everything he does.

1289
01:08:14,485 --> 01:08:16,578
I'm on his side, not yours.

1290
01:08:17,488 --> 01:08:19,217
And you don't talk to me!

1291
01:08:21,459 --> 01:08:25,020
I would tell you what I think of you...

1292
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:28,325
...but I'm a Christian woman.

1293
01:08:30,301 --> 01:08:31,563
Now you two leave me alone.

1294
01:08:31,703 --> 01:08:33,762
I have a sick child to look after.

1295
01:08:38,343 --> 01:08:41,403
I've decided to put Michael's name on the recipient list.

1296
01:08:43,181 --> 01:08:45,615
The hospital will pay for everything.

1297
01:08:47,552 --> 01:08:49,213
Really?

1298
01:08:49,454 --> 01:08:50,716
Really.

1299
01:08:52,223 --> 01:08:53,747
Thank you.

1300
01:08:55,159 --> 01:08:57,491
Oh, God, thank you.

1301
01:09:04,769 --> 01:09:05,963
You're good.

1302
01:09:06,104 --> 01:09:08,265
Excuse me?

1303
01:09:08,506 --> 01:09:09,837
Quite the performance.

1304
01:09:10,141 --> 01:09:12,632
- What are you talking about?
- Comforting embrace, sincere look.

1305
01:09:12,777 --> 01:09:15,610
For a minute, I actually believed you cared.

1306
01:09:28,559 --> 01:09:30,652
We go now to Hope Memorial Hospital. 

1307
01:09:30,795 --> 01:09:32,353
live... Tuck Lampley.

1308
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:35,497
As you can see. The crowd in front of Hope Memorial is growing.

1309
01:09:35,633 --> 01:09:38,124
The S.W.A.T. Team has arrived.

1310
01:09:38,269 --> 01:09:39,327
The situation is becoming tense.

1311
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:41,335
Standing next to me is James Palumbo.

1312
01:09:41,472 --> 01:09:42,905
friend of John Archibald.

1313
01:09:43,341 --> 01:09:46,037
Mr Palumbo. What can you tell us about John Archibald?

1314
01:09:46,944 --> 01:09:48,275
You know.

1315
01:09:49,514 --> 01:09:52,278
I got to be honest. Tuck.

1316
01:09:52,817 --> 01:09:56,082
This whole thing sucks.

1317
01:09:56,954 --> 01:10:00,446
It all could have been avoided so incredibly easy.

1318
01:10:01,092 --> 01:10:04,528
None of this had to happen if John had been a frigging millionaire

1319
01:10:04,662 --> 01:10:08,154
or if his last name was Rockefeller. but sometimes John don't get it.

1320
01:10:08,299 --> 01:10:12,235
He don't understand that what we hold sacred in this country isn't values.

1321
01:10:12,370 --> 01:10:14,497
It's value that's important.

1322
01:10:14,639 --> 01:10:16,630
We got haves. We got have-nots.

1323
01:10:16,774 --> 01:10:19,868
We've got white collar. blue collar. And no collar.

1324
01:10:20,144 --> 01:10:21,611
Inside there we got surgery.

1325
01:10:21,746 --> 01:10:24,715
outpatient surgery.

1326
01:10:24,849 --> 01:10:27,443
Out-of-luck surgery.

1327
01:10:27,585 --> 01:10:28,984
There's a lot of people out there

1328
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,748
who don't got 250 grand in their billfold.

1329
01:10:32,123 --> 01:10:35,615
To shame a man like that and back him into a corner.

1330
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:37,357
seems to me that something

1331
01:10:37,795 --> 01:10:39,990
is out of whack. Not someone.

1332
01:10:40,131 --> 01:10:43,100
But what do I know? I'm a factory worker.

1333
01:10:43,768 --> 01:10:45,565
I see this is making you upset.

1334
01:10:45,703 --> 01:10:47,933
but if you could look into the camera and speak to John Q right now.

1335
01:10:48,072 --> 01:10:49,300
what would you say to him?

1336
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:50,998


1337
01:10:51,509 --> 01:10:53,773
I'm there with you. and you take care.

1338
01:10:54,545 --> 01:10:56,513
That's one man's opinion.

1339
01:10:56,647 --> 01:10:59,980
Live at the crisis at Hope Memorial. this is Tuck Lampley.

1340
01:11:31,282 --> 01:11:32,510
What's going on? 

1341
01:11:32,650 --> 01:11:33,241


1342
01:11:33,384 --> 01:11:34,078
Where's everybody?

1343
01:11:34,218 --> 01:11:36,550
We're sending one of our guys in through the air duct.

1344
01:11:37,522 --> 01:11:40,047
If we can get the target to this phone,

1345
01:11:40,191 --> 01:11:41,180
we got a clear shot.

1346
01:11:41,325 --> 01:11:42,121
Is that right?

1347
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:44,524
Yes, Lieutenant, that is right.

1348
01:11:51,836 --> 01:11:54,361
When you're ready, Chief.

1349
01:12:01,946 --> 01:12:03,174
My wife's calling.

1350
01:12:03,314 --> 01:12:04,906
Worse than that. It's Father Time.

1351
01:12:05,316 --> 01:12:06,783
Come over here!

1352
01:12:07,585 --> 01:12:10,247
Not one word. I don't want to hear it.

1353
01:12:10,388 --> 01:12:12,447
You're going behind my back!

1354
01:12:12,590 --> 01:12:14,820
What do you want from me? Look at the clock! 

1355
01:12:14,959 --> 01:12:16,187
Look at your watch!

1356
01:12:16,327 --> 01:12:19,353
The guy said at a quarter after, he's going to start killing people.

1357
01:12:19,497 --> 01:12:21,226
This is so goddamned stupid!

1358
01:12:21,365 --> 01:12:22,764
What's your great idea?

1359
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:26,301
There are no great ideas, especially this!

1360
01:12:26,437 --> 01:12:29,634
I got a shot at this guy, I'm going to take it.

1361
01:12:29,774 --> 01:12:32,242
You know the drill. Always take the open shot.

1362
01:12:32,376 --> 01:12:35,402
The wife has agreed to speak to him. Let her talk him down.

1363
01:12:35,546 --> 01:12:37,241
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

1364
01:12:37,949 --> 01:12:39,382
You used the wife to set him up?

1365
01:12:39,517 --> 01:12:42,816
I'm going to use whatever works.

1366
01:12:42,954 --> 01:12:44,319
Let me paint a picture for you.

1367
01:12:44,455 --> 01:12:46,446
What we have is a lose/lose. 

1368
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,539
This guystarts whacking hostages, that's bad.

1369
01:12:47,639 --> 01:12:50,027
If we give into this asshole, it's also bad.

1370
01:12:50,127 --> 01:12:50,923
Bad for who?

1371
01:12:51,062 --> 01:12:54,589
Everybody. Me, you, everybody.

1372
01:12:54,732 --> 01:12:56,393
It's an election year.

1373
01:12:56,534 --> 01:12:58,559
However it goes down, this guy's not going to make it.

1374
01:12:58,703 --> 01:13:00,830
You kill him, that's a P.R. bonanza?

1375
01:13:00,972 --> 01:13:02,906
I can live with one dead bad guy.

1376
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,507
What I can't live with 

1377
01:13:04,642 --> 01:13:06,132
is one innocent person being hurt, 

1378
01:13:06,277 --> 01:13:08,040
not on my watch.

1379
01:13:09,814 --> 01:13:11,577
You know what, Frank? You're out!

1380
01:13:11,716 --> 01:13:12,683
I'm out?

1381
01:13:12,817 --> 01:13:15,513
You're officially relieved of duty.

1382
01:13:15,653 --> 01:13:16,915
I'm going to handle this now.

1383
01:13:17,054 --> 01:13:17,884
You?

1384
01:13:18,022 --> 01:13:18,989
Me. 

1385
01:13:19,123 --> 01:13:20,784
You think it's my first time around the dance floor?

1386
01:13:20,925 --> 01:13:22,916
How do you think I got these?

1387
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:24,425
And watch it.

1388
01:13:24,562 --> 01:13:27,588
I got a lot of pressure on me. There's a lot of eyes watching.

1389
01:13:27,732 --> 01:13:30,758
Someone's got to make the call. You're not going to do it, are you?

1390
01:13:30,902 --> 01:13:32,164
I'll do it.

1391
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:35,538
What about the hostages, the human beings?

1392
01:13:35,673 --> 01:13:37,470
Better keep their heads down.

1393
01:13:49,921 --> 01:13:50,751
Great.

1394
01:13:50,888 --> 01:13:51,547
What is it?

1395
01:13:51,689 --> 01:13:53,816
The air conditioning just turned off.

1396
01:14:00,264 --> 01:14:01,856
I'm counting on you. Don't let me down, okay? 

1397
01:14:01,999 --> 01:14:03,125
I'll call you!

1398
01:14:03,534 --> 01:14:05,627
Right on. Excuse me. Sorry.

1399
01:14:05,870 --> 01:14:08,464
Don't touch me! Excuse me. Thank you.

1400
01:14:08,806 --> 01:14:09,966
Tuck Lampley, Channel 8? 

1401
01:14:10,107 --> 01:14:10,732
Right. You got it.

1402
01:14:10,875 --> 01:14:12,809
Thanks, Officer! Excuse me.

1403
01:14:15,613 --> 01:14:16,545
Where's my picture?

1404
01:14:16,681 --> 01:14:18,876
I got to unscramble the police encryption. We're almost there.

1405
01:14:19,016 --> 01:14:21,883
Hurry up. I got a contact in Cardiology.

1406
01:14:22,019 --> 01:14:25,785
The cops are going to set up a call between this guy and his wife.

1407
01:14:29,627 --> 01:14:31,219
Are you with the wife?

1408
01:14:31,362 --> 01:14:33,057
All right, let's patch it through.

1409
01:15:04,595 --> 01:15:06,222
This better be good, Frank.

1410
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:14,137
God, baby.

1411
01:15:15,806 --> 01:15:17,205
We're on the list.

1412
01:15:17,341 --> 01:15:18,365
What?

1413
01:15:18,509 --> 01:15:20,443
Payne just left here.

1414
01:15:20,578 --> 01:15:23,638
Mikey's name is on the list. Baby, you did it.

1415
01:15:23,781 --> 01:15:26,249
What? We're on the list?

1416
01:15:31,989 --> 01:15:33,957
This is great, baby.

1417
01:15:41,332 --> 01:15:42,856
We got sound.

1418
01:15:43,901 --> 01:15:45,766
Where's the video? I need picture.

1419
01:15:45,903 --> 01:15:48,963
Boss, hang on. I'm going to make you really famous.

1420
01:15:49,807 --> 01:15:51,968
That's great, baby.

1421
01:15:56,347 --> 01:15:57,712
How's Mikey doing?

1422
01:16:03,421 --> 01:16:04,911
Not too good.

1423
01:16:05,322 --> 01:16:07,552
I think he's going away.

1424
01:16:07,691 --> 01:16:08,589
What?

1425
01:16:08,726 --> 01:16:12,685
They've done everything they can for him,

1426
01:16:13,097 --> 01:16:14,496
but he keeps getting worse and worse.

1427
01:16:18,436 --> 01:16:19,926
Oh, God.

1428
01:16:21,572 --> 01:16:23,335
Our poor baby.

1429
01:16:32,483 --> 01:16:34,781
Are you praying for him, John?

1430
01:16:34,919 --> 01:16:36,682
Are you praying for our baby?

1431
01:16:36,821 --> 01:16:40,086
Yes, sweetheart. You know I am.

1432
01:16:40,491 --> 01:16:42,425
Checkmate.

1433
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:43,322
This is the White Rook. Copy.

1434
01:16:43,461 --> 01:16:44,223
I copy, White Rook.

1435
01:16:44,361 --> 01:16:46,420
It's going to be all right, sweetheart. Listen to me.

1436
01:16:48,099 --> 01:16:49,657
He's going to make it.

1437
01:16:49,967 --> 01:16:51,730
I swear on my life, 

1438
01:16:51,869 --> 01:16:53,666
he's going to make it. You understand me?

1439
01:16:56,607 --> 01:16:59,235
You just got to believe me, you understand?

1440
01:16:59,944 --> 01:17:01,138
I believe.

1441
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:06,072
Is he awake? Is Mikey awake? Can I talk to him?

1442
01:17:06,584 --> 01:17:07,551
Hold on.

1443
01:17:18,295 --> 01:17:19,592
Oh, my God.

1444
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:21,730
We got it! Boss! The video's online.

1445
01:17:21,866 --> 01:17:23,731
You are a genius.

1446
01:17:23,868 --> 01:17:25,028
I got to get the monitor.

1447
01:17:25,169 --> 01:17:26,033
What are you doing standing around?

1448
01:17:26,170 --> 01:17:28,638
Move your ass! This is it!

1449
01:17:28,939 --> 01:17:29,928
Thank you.

1450
01:17:30,207 --> 01:17:31,572
Freddy, I swear to God...

1451
01:17:31,709 --> 01:17:34,109
Nigel, you're moving like lava. Hustle.

1452
01:17:34,245 --> 01:17:36,509
How's my hair? Never mind. Let's get this.

1453
01:17:36,647 --> 01:17:38,444
And three, two, one.

1454
01:17:38,582 --> 01:17:40,743
This is Tuck Lampley, live at Hope Memorial Hospital,

1455
01:17:40,885 --> 01:17:42,910
bringing you exclusive coverage 

1456
01:17:43,053 --> 01:17:44,247
between a father and his son

1457
01:17:44,388 --> 01:17:46,413
he's fighting most desperately to save.

1458
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:53,052
Honey? It's your dad. He's on the phone.

1459
01:18:00,437 --> 01:18:01,802
Champ.

1460
01:18:04,074 --> 01:18:06,065
How's my boy?

1461
01:18:06,443 --> 01:18:08,434
You hanging in there?

1462
01:18:10,247 --> 01:18:11,509
How are you?

1463
01:18:12,049 --> 01:18:14,847
How am I? I'm good.

1464
01:18:15,419 --> 01:18:17,580
Don't worry about me. I'm good.

1465
01:18:25,296 --> 01:18:28,265
How come you're not here, Dad?

1466
01:18:37,007 --> 01:18:39,601
I'm tied up. I can't get away now.

1467
01:18:39,743 --> 01:18:41,904
But I'm close.

1468
01:18:42,213 --> 01:18:43,578
real close to you.

1469
01:18:44,048 --> 01:18:47,108
Mom says I need a new heart.

1470
01:18:47,318 --> 01:18:49,479
That's right, champ. You do.

1471
01:18:51,355 --> 01:18:53,823
But what's wrong with my heart?

1472
01:18:53,958 --> 01:18:55,550
There's nothing wrong.

1473
01:18:55,693 --> 01:18:57,024
It's just that you...

1474
01:19:00,531 --> 01:19:02,021
You just need a...

1475
01:19:02,533 --> 01:19:08,472
You got to get a better heart to be stronger, that's all.

1476
01:19:08,606 --> 01:19:10,699
They're giving you a new one

1477
01:19:10,841 --> 01:19:12,638
that's going to make you real strong.

1478
01:19:26,857 --> 01:19:28,984
Am I going to die?

1479
01:19:29,994 --> 01:19:33,157
No, you're not going to die. Of course not.

1480
01:19:34,832 --> 01:19:36,356
How do you know?

1481
01:19:37,234 --> 01:19:40,965
What good would the world be without you?

1482
01:19:41,105 --> 01:19:43,369
Oh, my God. This is the greatest thing I've ever seen.

1483
01:19:43,507 --> 01:19:45,771
Without you there is no world.

1484
01:19:46,110 --> 01:19:47,702
This is my white Bronco.

1485
01:19:50,748 --> 01:19:51,806
Listen to me.

1486
01:19:52,716 --> 01:19:54,047
On your command.

1487
01:19:54,285 --> 01:19:56,048
You know I love you, don't you?

1488
01:19:56,587 --> 01:19:58,452
You know how proud I am of you?

1489
01:20:00,457 --> 01:20:02,550
I just wanted to make sure you know that.

1490
01:20:03,727 --> 01:20:06,696
I just wanted to tell you that in case I forgot.

1491
01:20:08,832 --> 01:20:09,799
Take the shot.

1492
01:20:11,802 --> 01:20:13,133
It's not clear.

1493
01:20:14,738 --> 01:20:16,262
Holding.

1494
01:20:18,609 --> 01:20:21,942
Why don't you give me one of those Chris Cormeirs?

1495
01:20:28,085 --> 01:20:29,552
Chris Cormeir. He's great.

1496
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:32,580
He's great and so are you, baby.

1497
01:20:37,094 --> 01:20:39,187
I love you, Dad.

1498
01:20:41,365 --> 01:20:43,629
Okay, son.

1499
01:20:45,069 --> 01:20:47,367
I'll talk to you later, okay?

1500
01:20:48,005 --> 01:20:50,132
With all my heant. Son. I love you.

1501
01:20:50,274 --> 01:20:51,468
I love you. Too. Dad.

1502
01:20:51,608 --> 01:20:52,370
Oh, shit!

1503
01:20:55,579 --> 01:20:56,773
You're on TV, man. 

1504
01:20:57,681 --> 01:20:58,841
Channel 8.

1505
01:21:31,181 --> 01:21:33,046
He's down. We got him.

1506
01:21:44,828 --> 01:21:46,193
He's not down.

1507
01:21:56,540 --> 01:21:57,973
Goddamn it!

1508
01:22:00,878 --> 01:22:02,778
This is very bad, Gus.

1509
01:22:03,547 --> 01:22:03,979
Not now.

1510
01:22:04,114 --> 01:22:05,479
It's the mayor, sir. 

1511
01:22:05,616 --> 01:22:06,947
We better kill this video feed.

1512
01:22:07,084 --> 01:22:08,415
The press hacked into our signal.

1513
01:22:08,552 --> 01:22:11,043
This went out live over national television.

1514
01:22:33,210 --> 01:22:34,734
Mikey's not going to make it.

1515
01:22:35,112 --> 01:22:36,306
What about the list?

1516
01:22:36,447 --> 01:22:37,573
What list? They're shooting at me, 

1517
01:22:37,714 --> 01:22:38,942
shooting at us.

1518
01:22:39,283 --> 01:22:40,409
They're not going to help my son.

1519
01:22:40,551 --> 01:22:40,846
The sniper gained access to the hospital through the venti...

1520
01:22:44,354 --> 01:22:45,286
Are you going to bust me?

1521
01:22:45,422 --> 01:22:46,218
Out of here.

1522
01:22:46,356 --> 01:22:49,291
You just shot an innocent man on prime-time TV.

1523
01:23:14,351 --> 01:23:15,943
Where's Grimes?

1524
01:23:17,621 --> 01:23:18,747
Hang in there, man!

1525
01:23:19,389 --> 01:23:21,687
Where's Lieutenant Grimes?

1526
01:23:22,626 --> 01:23:23,524
All right.

1527
01:23:24,661 --> 01:23:25,628
All right what?

1528
01:23:25,762 --> 01:23:27,286
Let's go see what he wants.

1529
01:23:27,798 --> 01:23:28,526
You've got to be kidding.

1530
01:23:28,665 --> 01:23:31,259
Don't start breaking my balls. I screwed up, all right?

1531
01:23:31,568 --> 01:23:32,830
I need you to save my ass. 

1532
01:23:32,970 --> 01:23:34,870
I really stepped in shit. Please.

1533
01:23:35,472 --> 01:23:37,997
Come on, I'll buy you a steak.

1534
01:23:40,043 --> 01:23:41,408
Peking duck. Let's go.

1535
01:23:44,181 --> 01:23:47,116
A-R-C-H-l-B-A-L-D.

1536
01:23:47,985 --> 01:23:50,215
I'm faxing you all the stuff right now.

1537
01:23:59,530 --> 01:24:01,828
Come over here.

1538
01:24:03,534 --> 01:24:04,558
Hold your fire!

1539
01:24:05,068 --> 01:24:07,093
Don't fire. Turn them down.

1540
01:24:07,237 --> 01:24:10,331
There's a lot of cameras. I don't want anybody doing anything.

1541
01:24:11,441 --> 01:24:12,703
Who's that with you?

1542
01:24:13,744 --> 01:24:15,177
- Sergeant...
- Moody!

1543
01:24:15,312 --> 01:24:19,373
Police Chief Moroe.

1544
01:24:19,883 --> 01:24:22,044
What's going on here, John?

1545
01:24:25,255 --> 01:24:26,745
He's got no pants on.

1546
01:24:34,965 --> 01:24:36,159
You lied to me, Lieutenant.

1547
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:39,269
You said you were going to call me back, but you didn't.

1548
01:24:39,403 --> 01:24:40,734
I gave you your hostages,

1549
01:24:40,871 --> 01:24:42,600
but you didn't call me back. Why?

1550
01:24:43,106 --> 01:24:44,505
Because you want me dead.

1551
01:24:44,641 --> 01:24:46,268
Nobody wants to kill you.

1552
01:24:46,410 --> 01:24:48,071
Nobody wants to kill me?

1553
01:24:49,746 --> 01:24:51,611
None of these guys? Not him?

1554
01:24:52,449 --> 01:24:54,212
What is this?

1555
01:25:00,958 --> 01:25:02,619
What did you think would happen?

1556
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:05,690
You want truth? Here's some truth.

1557
01:25:05,829 --> 01:25:07,660
This is going to end up bad for you.

1558
01:25:07,798 --> 01:25:09,390
There's only two ways out of here.

1559
01:25:10,033 --> 01:25:11,660
Jail 

1560
01:25:12,035 --> 01:25:13,195
or dead.

1561
01:25:13,737 --> 01:25:15,466
My son is very sick 

1562
01:25:16,740 --> 01:25:18,435
and he needs some help.

1563
01:25:20,010 --> 01:25:21,875
It's hard to be a man these days,

1564
01:25:22,012 --> 01:25:23,343
hard to know what the right thing is.

1565
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:24,708
But put the gun down, John.

1566
01:25:24,848 --> 01:25:28,750
You're not hearing me, Frank! My son is sick! 

1567
01:25:29,019 --> 01:25:31,419
That's it! There's nothing else.

1568
01:25:31,555 --> 01:25:32,647
End of story.

1569
01:25:34,257 --> 01:25:37,192
When people are sick, they deserve a little help.

1570
01:25:38,261 --> 01:25:40,229
Sick, help.

1571
01:25:40,998 --> 01:25:43,262
Sick, help.

1572
01:25:45,102 --> 01:25:48,799
I am not going to bury my son!

1573
01:25:49,473 --> 01:25:52,067
My son is going to bury me.

1574
01:25:53,110 --> 01:25:56,739
You think these people give a shit about you? They don't.

1575
01:25:57,014 --> 01:25:58,777
You're just the cause of the moment.

1576
01:25:58,915 --> 01:26:01,611
Nobody cares. That's the real truth.

1577
01:26:01,885 --> 01:26:03,944
Nobody cares. Only you.

1578
01:26:05,455 --> 01:26:07,184
And it's only you and me out here

1579
01:26:07,324 --> 01:26:10,816
and all these guns pointed at you.

1580
01:26:10,961 --> 01:26:14,453
What do you want to do? It's your call.

1581
01:26:14,598 --> 01:26:16,225
I want my son.

1582
01:26:17,334 --> 01:26:20,064
I want my son inside with me.

1583
01:26:20,303 --> 01:26:21,497
Can't do it, John!

1584
01:26:21,805 --> 01:26:24,638
You give me my boy, I give you your sniper.

1585
01:26:24,775 --> 01:26:25,901
It's all over.

1586
01:26:27,978 --> 01:26:30,071
You bring my son,

1587
01:26:30,547 --> 01:26:31,741
I give up...

1588
01:26:33,083 --> 01:26:34,710
...everybody goes home.

1589
01:26:37,621 --> 01:26:39,953
Everybody's safe.

1590
01:26:43,193 --> 01:26:45,252
You bring me my son.

1591
01:26:46,129 --> 01:26:47,061
Come on.

1592
01:26:47,731 --> 01:26:48,561
All right.

1593
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,067
What do you think, Frank?

1594
01:26:53,503 --> 01:26:55,528
Give it to him. 

1595
01:26:55,672 --> 01:26:57,230
He's not going to hurt anybody with his boy in there.

1596
01:26:57,374 --> 01:26:59,569
The object is to get hostages out, not bring them in.

1597
01:26:59,710 --> 01:27:02,008
It's not a hostage. It's his son.

1598
01:27:02,679 --> 01:27:05,409
Have all these people been on the news?

1599
01:27:06,183 --> 01:27:07,878
It's your call, Frank.

1600
01:27:13,356 --> 01:27:14,687
All right, give it to him.

1601
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:18,855
- Hold it!
- No, listen to me.

1602
01:27:18,995 --> 01:27:22,158
I'm his mother. I need to be in there!

1603
01:27:25,936 --> 01:27:27,733
Stop! Stop right there!

1604
01:27:27,871 --> 01:27:30,396
Go! Beat it! Now!

1605
01:27:46,790 --> 01:27:47,950
We're in trouble. 

1606
01:27:48,191 --> 01:27:50,352
Mike's blood pressure has dropped into the mid-40s.

1607
01:27:50,694 --> 01:27:53,492
His atrial blood pressure should be in the low teens. 

1608
01:27:53,630 --> 01:27:54,562
It's 35.

1609
01:27:54,698 --> 01:27:55,722
I'm sorry, John.

1610
01:27:56,133 --> 01:27:57,395
Without a new heart,

1611
01:27:58,568 --> 01:28:00,263
he's not going to make it.

1612
01:28:07,010 --> 01:28:08,272
Then take mine.

1613
01:28:09,212 --> 01:28:09,871
What?

1614
01:28:10,013 --> 01:28:11,002
You heard me.

1615
01:28:11,148 --> 01:28:13,878
Take my heart, and you put it in Mike.

1616
01:28:14,017 --> 01:28:16,542
You done lost your damn mind.

1617
01:28:16,686 --> 01:28:17,482
You can't be serious.

1618
01:28:17,621 --> 01:28:19,953
You bet I'm serious. I'm dead serious.

1619
01:28:20,090 --> 01:28:21,648
Oh, my God.

1620
01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:23,786
You'll be dead.

1621
01:28:23,927 --> 01:28:25,121
And my son will live.

1622
01:28:25,262 --> 01:28:26,092
You can't do this.

1623
01:28:26,229 --> 01:28:26,923
It's the only way.

1624
01:28:27,063 --> 01:28:29,054
Physically, you can't do this.

1625
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:31,429
I kill myself.

1626
01:28:31,802 --> 01:28:34,362
You open me up, take my heart. It's perfect.

1627
01:28:34,504 --> 01:28:35,766
That's just crazy.

1628
01:28:35,906 --> 01:28:38,431
We can't just remove your heart and put it into Michael's body.

1629
01:28:38,575 --> 01:28:39,872
There are too many unknowns.

1630
01:28:40,010 --> 01:28:42,945
Matching donor and recipient is extremely complicated.

1631
01:28:43,079 --> 01:28:44,774
Critical tests have to be taken.

1632
01:28:44,915 --> 01:28:45,438
Like what?

1633
01:28:45,582 --> 01:28:47,675
Cross matches for blood type, chest cavity measurements.

1634
01:28:47,818 --> 01:28:49,979
If blood tissues are not completely compatible...

1635
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:51,985
I know about compatibility. We've been tested up the wazoo.

1636
01:28:52,122 --> 01:28:56,183
We're both B-positive. Our tissues match.

1637
01:28:56,326 --> 01:28:59,261
His heart's three times the size of normal, so mine will fit.

1638
01:28:59,396 --> 01:29:00,761
You know we're compatible.

1639
01:29:00,897 --> 01:29:02,330
Out of the question. Too risky.

1640
01:29:02,465 --> 01:29:04,626
I'm telling you he will make it!

1641
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:06,326
Can't do it.

1642
01:29:06,469 --> 01:29:07,731
If I'm laying dead, 

1643
01:29:07,871 --> 01:29:09,736
you're not going to take my heart and save his life?

1644
01:29:09,873 --> 01:29:13,274
You'll let two die instead of one because of a technicality?

1645
01:29:13,410 --> 01:29:15,640
I think what John is trying to do is right.

1646
01:29:15,779 --> 01:29:17,610
Me, too. I think it's so brave.

1647
01:29:17,747 --> 01:29:20,045
What do you think Mike would want? What about your wife?

1648
01:29:20,183 --> 01:29:22,447
Mike's too young to know what's good for him.

1649
01:29:22,586 --> 01:29:24,349
It's my job to protect him. 

1650
01:29:24,487 --> 01:29:25,681
Denise would do the same thing.

1651
01:29:29,159 --> 01:29:31,024
I know what's happening to Mike is bad.

1652
01:29:31,161 --> 01:29:32,719
Matter of fact, it's the worst.

1653
01:29:32,863 --> 01:29:35,423
But killing yourself ain't going to solve a damn thing.

1654
01:29:36,066 --> 01:29:38,057
Sometimes you just

1655
01:29:38,201 --> 01:29:39,759
got to let go and let God...

1656
01:29:40,637 --> 01:29:42,571
Just accept it, brother.

1657
01:29:43,273 --> 01:29:44,501
Accept it?

1658
01:29:45,976 --> 01:29:47,409
Accept what?

1659
01:29:49,179 --> 01:29:50,669
Accept what?

1660
01:29:50,914 --> 01:29:51,881
That Mike is going to die.

1661
01:29:52,015 --> 01:29:55,610
No, I don't accept that. 

1662
01:29:56,019 --> 01:29:57,213
Ever.

1663
01:29:58,722 --> 01:30:01,316
I reject that out of hand.

1664
01:30:01,458 --> 01:30:03,892
All right, he's a patient to you, I understand, 

1665
01:30:04,027 --> 01:30:06,154
but he's a good kid.

1666
01:30:06,296 --> 01:30:09,265
He loves bodybuilding.

1667
01:30:09,399 --> 01:30:11,959
He wants to be a bodybuilder. Can you believe that?

1668
01:30:12,102 --> 01:30:15,094
He's funny. You'd like him.

1669
01:30:16,339 --> 01:30:18,307
You'd like him if you got to know him.

1670
01:30:18,441 --> 01:30:19,430
I do like him.

1671
01:30:19,576 --> 01:30:22,010
Then, please, I'm just begging you,

1672
01:30:22,145 --> 01:30:23,112
step outside the rules.

1673
01:30:23,246 --> 01:30:25,146
I'd like to, John, I really would,

1674
01:30:25,482 --> 01:30:28,542
but what you're asking crosses the line.

1675
01:30:28,685 --> 01:30:29,879
It is completely unethical.

1676
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:32,284
I'm crossing the line? You're crossing.

1677
01:30:32,422 --> 01:30:34,185
The whole system is crossing the line.

1678
01:30:34,324 --> 01:30:36,053
Maybe you don't understand what I'm talking about.

1679
01:30:36,192 --> 01:30:40,094
I don't give a damn. My son's going to live.

1680
01:30:40,230 --> 01:30:41,891
Maybe you haven't figured that out by now.

1681
01:30:42,032 --> 01:30:44,762
I'll do whatever I got to do for him to live.

1682
01:30:44,901 --> 01:30:46,459
What are you going to do,

1683
01:30:47,137 --> 01:30:49,435
shoot me if I don't operate?

1684
01:30:52,075 --> 01:30:53,599
I'm going to kill myself.

1685
01:30:55,779 --> 01:30:56,973
All right?

1686
01:30:57,247 --> 01:30:58,908
Let's just see what happens.

1687
01:30:59,349 --> 01:31:02,113
That's what this is about, right? He needs a donor.

1688
01:31:02,252 --> 01:31:03,913
Somebody's got to die for him to live.

1689
01:31:04,054 --> 01:31:06,454
I'm his father. It's me.

1690
01:31:15,365 --> 01:31:16,662
All right.

1691
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,290
All right what?

1692
01:31:18,568 --> 01:31:19,796
I'll do it, if that's what you want.

1693
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:21,335
You're going to let him kill himself?

1694
01:31:21,471 --> 01:31:23,405
Once he's dead, why not?

1695
01:31:23,673 --> 01:31:26,164
You are the finest surgeon I have ever known.

1696
01:31:26,309 --> 01:31:28,800
You cannot throw your career, your life away for this.

1697
01:31:28,945 --> 01:31:31,106
If you do this, you're finished.

1698
01:31:31,247 --> 01:31:33,112
What are they going to do, sue me?

1699
01:31:33,249 --> 01:31:34,773
Disbar me?

1700
01:31:35,385 --> 01:31:37,546
Evict me from the country club?

1701
01:31:37,787 --> 01:31:40,017
This is still a hospital.

1702
01:31:40,590 --> 01:31:42,319
If there's a heart available,

1703
01:31:43,259 --> 01:31:44,521
I'm not going to let it go to waste.

1704
01:31:44,661 --> 01:31:47,687
Doctor, Mr Maguire, let's get ready for surgery.

1705
01:32:15,058 --> 01:32:16,457
They're ready to harvest.

1706
01:32:17,894 --> 01:32:20,294
All right, hurry up, guys.

1707
01:32:21,564 --> 01:32:22,861
Get her on the table.

1708
01:32:23,133 --> 01:32:24,225
What's our time?

1709
01:32:24,367 --> 01:32:25,527
All right, ready to lift.

1710
01:32:27,137 --> 01:32:28,536
Oh-four-five.

1711
01:32:32,842 --> 01:32:34,002
Scalpels laid out.

1712
01:32:34,144 --> 01:32:35,372
Where's his tray?

1713
01:32:35,512 --> 01:32:37,639
Got the other one ready? Bring the cart around, please.

1714
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:45,246
What do we have?

1715
01:32:45,655 --> 01:32:46,986
Female donor, 26 years old.

1716
01:32:48,758 --> 01:32:50,658
She is 26 years old, 5'7".

1717
01:32:50,794 --> 01:32:52,591
Liver, kidneys usable.

1718
01:32:52,729 --> 01:32:55,163
Liver and kidneys are both usable. 

1719
01:32:55,432 --> 01:32:56,524
Lungs?

1720
01:32:57,867 --> 01:32:58,561
Lungs are okay. 

1721
01:32:58,701 --> 01:32:59,497
Heart?

1722
01:32:59,636 --> 01:33:00,466
Heart is good.

1723
01:33:00,603 --> 01:33:02,628
Blood type?

1724
01:33:03,807 --> 01:33:05,468
B-positive.

1725
01:33:08,745 --> 01:33:10,406
This is my...

1726
01:33:12,816 --> 01:33:14,340
...my will.

1727
01:33:15,685 --> 01:33:18,677
It says I'm leaving my heart to my son,

1728
01:33:18,988 --> 01:33:21,218
and I need two witnesses to sign.

1729
01:33:21,357 --> 01:33:22,483
I'm not signing it.

1730
01:33:22,625 --> 01:33:24,388
I ain't going to watch you kill yourself.

1731
01:33:24,661 --> 01:33:25,821
Me, neither.

1732
01:33:25,962 --> 01:33:28,328
The sooner you sign it, the sooner you go home.

1733
01:33:30,467 --> 01:33:32,992
I'll sign.

1734
01:33:33,236 --> 01:33:34,396
Me, too.

1735
01:33:45,014 --> 01:33:47,346
You're just going to go in there and off yourself?

1736
01:33:47,484 --> 01:33:48,849
Only one thing will stop me.

1737
01:33:48,985 --> 01:33:50,077
What's that?

1738
01:33:50,386 --> 01:33:51,785
If Mitch is B-positive.

1739
01:33:51,921 --> 01:33:56,119
Type O. Swear to God.

1740
01:34:00,997 --> 01:34:02,225
Thank you.

1741
01:34:02,599 --> 01:34:04,396
You be good. Be careful.

1742
01:34:17,914 --> 01:34:19,609
See you in the funny papers.

1743
01:34:29,826 --> 01:34:31,657
Can I have a word with him?

1744
01:34:34,664 --> 01:34:35,528
Thank you.

1745
01:35:14,037 --> 01:35:15,334
How you doing, buddy?

1746
01:35:18,308 --> 01:35:21,675
Did you find me a new heart?

1747
01:35:24,781 --> 01:35:26,612
We got you one.

1748
01:35:27,150 --> 01:35:29,710
I guess you got a guardian angel.

1749
01:35:30,353 --> 01:35:34,813
Just try to stay awake for a minute, okay?

1750
01:35:35,091 --> 01:35:37,525
I just need to tell you a few things.

1751
01:35:44,867 --> 01:35:47,768
You always listen to your mother.

1752
01:35:48,304 --> 01:35:49,794
You understand?

1753
01:35:50,373 --> 01:35:52,398
Do what she tells you to do.

1754
01:35:55,178 --> 01:35:57,146
She's your best friend.

1755
01:35:58,414 --> 01:36:00,473
You tell her you love her every day.

1756
01:36:04,187 --> 01:36:08,487
You're too young for girls right now, but...

1757
01:36:08,625 --> 01:36:12,652
...there's going to come a time.

1758
01:36:13,363 --> 01:36:14,421
When it does,

1759
01:36:14,564 --> 01:36:16,964
you treat them like princesses.

1760
01:36:17,867 --> 01:36:19,630
'Cause that's what they are.

1761
01:36:23,573 --> 01:36:25,973
When you say you're going to do something...

1762
01:36:42,191 --> 01:36:45,058
When you say you're going to do something, you do it.

1763
01:36:47,597 --> 01:36:49,588
Because your word is your bond, son.

1764
01:36:49,732 --> 01:36:51,199
It's all you have.

1765
01:36:53,703 --> 01:36:56,638
And money. You make money if you get a chance,

1766
01:36:56,773 --> 01:36:58,968
even if you got to sell out once in a while.

1767
01:36:59,108 --> 01:37:00,302
Make as much money as you can.

1768
01:37:00,443 --> 01:37:02,070
Don't be stupid like your father.

1769
01:37:03,313 --> 01:37:06,248
Everything is so much easier with money, son.

1770
01:37:08,184 --> 01:37:09,674
Don't smoke.

1771
01:37:13,456 --> 01:37:16,016
Be kind to people.

1772
01:37:16,359 --> 01:37:18,088
When somebody chooses you...

1773
01:37:18,461 --> 01:37:21,862
We talked about this. You stand up. You be a man.

1774
01:37:23,433 --> 01:37:29,429
You stay away from the bad things, son, please.

1775
01:37:31,174 --> 01:37:33,904
Don't get caught up in the bad things.

1776
01:37:36,045 --> 01:37:39,310
There's so many great things out there for you.

1777
01:37:48,925 --> 01:37:51,189
I'll never leave you.

1778
01:38:00,103 --> 01:38:02,264
I'm always with you.

1779
01:38:05,842 --> 01:38:07,332
Right there.

1780
01:38:13,549 --> 01:38:15,073
I love you, son.

1781
01:38:40,009 --> 01:38:41,601
I'll see you later.

1782
01:38:47,235 --> 01:38:48,800
Turner gets the other one.

1783
01:38:55,266 --> 01:38:57,141
Match with donor.

1784
01:39:06,068 --> 01:39:08,298
Oh, my sweet Jesus.

1785
01:39:22,251 --> 01:39:24,378
Let's do it.

1786
01:39:45,341 --> 01:39:49,038
Wait a minute. Are you telling me that gun was empty the whole time?

1787
01:39:49,178 --> 01:39:51,874
I'm all talk.

1788
01:39:52,915 --> 01:39:55,406
The only one I ever considered killing was me.

1789
01:40:11,367 --> 01:40:13,358
Maybe we should get some towels.

1790
01:40:15,571 --> 01:40:16,094
You're not going to believe this.

1791
01:40:16,772 --> 01:40:17,534
We got a match.

1792
01:40:17,673 --> 01:40:19,800
B-positive. Michael William Archibald,

1793
01:40:19,942 --> 01:40:22,172
the only status one in the country.

1794
01:40:22,311 --> 01:40:23,710
I'll be damned.

1795
01:40:44,033 --> 01:40:45,398
I'm thirsty.

1796
01:40:53,876 --> 01:40:56,037
We have very good news.

1797
01:41:07,623 --> 01:41:09,113
Jesus.

1798
01:41:15,131 --> 01:41:16,689
The safety's on.

1799
01:41:16,832 --> 01:41:17,594
Is this for real?

1800
01:41:17,733 --> 01:41:20,201
The jet landed at O'Hare.

1801
01:41:20,336 --> 01:41:21,826
The helicopter's going to be here in 15 minutes.

1802
01:41:21,971 --> 01:41:23,438
You do the honours, okay? Go.

1803
01:41:27,977 --> 01:41:31,276
Baby. It's me.

1804
01:41:35,084 --> 01:41:37,609
It's not working.

1805
01:41:38,888 --> 01:41:42,722
Please. Baby. Pick up.

1806
01:41:45,361 --> 01:41:46,851
John. Can you...

1807
01:42:02,912 --> 01:42:04,846
It's a miracle, baby! They found a heart!

1808
01:42:05,081 --> 01:42:08,050
It's a miracle, baby! They found a heart!

1809
01:42:08,618 --> 01:42:09,983
The heant is here!

1810
01:42:10,252 --> 01:42:13,244
I repeat... the heant for little Mike Archibald has arrived.

1811
01:42:13,522 --> 01:42:17,083
What an unbelievable ending to this incredible. Tumultuous day.

1812
01:42:19,495 --> 01:42:20,462
- There they are.
- Okay. Here we go.

1813
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:27,034
Yes. The hostages are coming out.

1814
01:42:27,536 --> 01:42:29,128
One. Two.

1815
01:42:29,271 --> 01:42:32,763
They appear to be unharmed but centainly exhausted
from what must have been an excruciating ordeal.

1816
01:42:32,908 --> 01:42:35,103
More now! More coming out. hands waving in the air.

1817
01:42:35,244 --> 01:42:39,578
Freedom. Freedom at last.

1818
01:42:39,949 --> 01:42:42,577
Police are esconting them one by one to safety.

1819
01:42:42,718 --> 01:42:43,707
How do you feel?

1820
01:42:43,853 --> 01:42:46,822
Somebody else is coming. It's John Q.

1821
01:42:47,156 --> 01:42:50,148
John Q has come out. hands in the air.

1822
01:42:50,292 --> 01:42:52,726
He's putting the gun down. He appears to be surrendering.

1823
01:42:53,963 --> 01:42:55,726
The police are approaching cautiously now.

1824
01:42:56,732 --> 01:42:59,929
And they've got him. They've subdued John Q.

1825
01:43:00,403 --> 01:43:03,065
The handcuffs are on. and it appears to be over.

1826
01:43:03,205 --> 01:43:04,900
It's all over.

1827
01:43:05,274 --> 01:43:07,708
If pictures speak a thousand words.

1828
01:43:07,843 --> 01:43:10,403
then these images do speak volumes.

1829
01:43:10,546 --> 01:43:14,038
And now. As the bloody standoff comes to an end. We remind you

1830
01:43:14,183 --> 01:43:16,208
that Channel 8 News was here first

1831
01:43:16,352 --> 01:43:20,448
with exclusive moment-to-moment live coverage

1832
01:43:20,589 --> 01:43:22,750
of "Crisis at Hope Memorial." 

1833
01:43:22,892 --> 01:43:24,154
I'm Tuck Lampley.

1834
01:43:33,736 --> 01:43:34,964
Open those doors!

1835
01:43:35,671 --> 01:43:36,797
Look out! We're coming through! Come on!

1836
01:43:47,316 --> 01:43:49,079
We love you, John!

1837
01:43:49,618 --> 01:43:51,950
God bless you! I'd do the same thing!

1838
01:44:18,180 --> 01:44:19,204
Heart.

1839
01:44:21,517 --> 01:44:22,347
Thank you.

1840
01:44:25,287 --> 01:44:26,481
Metzenbaums.

1841
01:44:30,659 --> 01:44:32,058
Prepare for cutting.

1842
01:44:48,611 --> 01:44:51,239
Put these on for me, would you do that?

1843
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:52,438
Take your time.

1844
01:45:04,527 --> 01:45:05,994
Lift it.

1845
01:45:07,596 --> 01:45:09,063
All right, done.

1846
01:45:09,198 --> 01:45:10,256
How beautiful was that?

1847
01:45:10,399 --> 01:45:11,297
Pressure up.

1848
01:45:11,433 --> 01:45:12,900
Pressure up.

1849
01:45:14,136 --> 01:45:17,128
And now one, two, three.

1850
01:45:24,246 --> 01:45:25,213
It worked!

1851
01:45:39,762 --> 01:45:40,854
The other big story...John Q goes on trial today

1852
01:45:40,996 --> 01:45:43,931
for kidnapping and attempted murder charges

1853
01:45:44,066 --> 01:45:47,558
all because an HMO denied coverage 

1854
01:45:47,703 --> 01:45:49,295
for his son's heant transplant.

1855
01:45:49,438 --> 01:45:52,635
... more expensive for you in the future. HMOs. To deny coverage...

1856
01:45:52,775 --> 01:45:57,109
There are still 40 million Americans who are uninsured...

1857
01:45:57,246 --> 01:46:01,808
Tonight. As the trial continues.

1858
01:46:01,951 --> 01:46:04,044
John Quincy Archibald... vigilante or heroic father?

1859
01:46:04,186 --> 01:46:05,380
... is to sue the pants off them

1860
01:46:05,521 --> 01:46:08,217
for millions of dollars to let them know...

1861
01:46:08,357 --> 01:46:14,023
We have known foryears this is a crappy health care system.

1862
01:46:14,163 --> 01:46:17,758
We've known we had to do something...

1863
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:21,427
John Q was using one of those faith-based health care plans.

1864
01:46:21,570 --> 01:46:24,505
You just pray. and the government does nothing.

1865
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:27,370
... not agree with that? 

1866
01:46:27,509 --> 01:46:28,908
The point is. 

1867
01:46:29,044 --> 01:46:30,068
the enemy we're trying to identify is us.

1868
01:46:30,212 --> 01:46:33,079
We are the ones who shot down national health care.

1869
01:46:35,150 --> 01:46:36,913
We are the ones who don't want our taxes raised.

1870
01:46:37,052 --> 01:46:38,883
You have to look in the mirror for this problem.

1871
01:46:40,055 --> 01:46:43,149
Back up. Come on.

1872
01:46:43,425 --> 01:46:46,826
Just one question, please!

1873
01:46:50,313 --> 01:46:52,087
How's your son doing, John?

1874
01:46:53,236 --> 01:46:55,007
A statement, please!

1875
01:46:55,037 --> 01:46:57,096
Out of the way. Let's go.

1876
01:46:58,173 --> 01:47:01,040
- How are you feeling right now?
- Smile, John!

1877
01:47:02,645 --> 01:47:06,513
Has the jury reached a verdict?

1878
01:47:16,859 --> 01:47:18,656
We have, Your Honour.

1879
01:47:18,894 --> 01:47:23,729
As to count one, attempted murder...

1880
01:47:23,966 --> 01:47:26,628
we find the defendant John Quincy Archibald

1881
01:47:26,769 --> 01:47:28,134
not guilty.

1882
01:47:30,172 --> 01:47:31,400
Quiet, please.

1883
01:47:31,674 --> 01:47:33,107
On count two,

1884
01:47:33,475 --> 01:47:35,739
armed criminal action... 

1885
01:47:36,045 --> 01:47:37,535
not guilty.

1886
01:47:38,347 --> 01:47:40,178
Quiet!

1887
01:47:40,549 --> 01:47:42,141
On the final count, the kidnapping

1888
01:47:42,418 --> 01:47:46,377
and false imprisonment of Julie Byrd,

1889
01:47:46,522 --> 01:47:49,855
Max Conlan, Rosa Gonzalez, 

1890
01:47:49,992 --> 01:47:52,187
Dr Allen Klein,

1891
01:47:52,328 --> 01:47:55,991
Lester Matthews, Steve Maguire,

1892
01:47:56,131 --> 01:47:58,656
Miriam and Steve Smith,

1893
01:47:58,801 --> 01:48:00,928
Dr Raymond Turner,

1894
01:48:01,070 --> 01:48:05,097
Mitch Quigley, Debby Utley,

1895
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:07,105
we find the defendant...

1896
01:48:08,243 --> 01:48:09,870
guilty.

1897
01:48:12,047 --> 01:48:13,275
Quiet, please. 

1898
01:48:13,415 --> 01:48:15,383
Sentencing will be one week from today.

1899
01:48:16,051 --> 01:48:17,575
All rise.

1900
01:48:20,622 --> 01:48:22,249
What are we looking at?

1901
01:48:22,391 --> 01:48:23,983
He's going to do some time.

1902
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:27,154
The judge is not going to give him more than three to five.

1903
01:48:27,296 --> 01:48:29,161
I'll try and get it down to two.

1904
01:48:29,398 --> 01:48:30,456
I'm sorry.

1905
01:48:34,570 --> 01:48:36,367
You all right, slugger?

1906
01:48:37,906 --> 01:48:39,931
You take good care of your mother, okay?

1907
01:48:40,075 --> 01:48:42,043
You're the man of the house now.

1908
01:48:42,177 --> 01:48:45,476
You have any problems, Jimmy and Gina will be here for you, too.

1909
01:48:58,293 --> 01:49:00,193
I'm so proud of you.

1910
01:49:05,768 --> 01:49:07,167
Give them frigging hell, Johnny.

1911
01:49:07,302 --> 01:49:08,564
Don't worry about nothing.

1912
01:49:14,176 --> 01:49:15,871
It's not good-bye, son.

1913
01:49:17,546 --> 01:49:19,241
See you later.

1914
01:49:42,571 --> 01:49:43,868
Take care, man.

1915
01:49:44,540 --> 01:49:46,508
You my hero.

1916
01:50:24,179 --> 01:50:25,476
Thank you.
