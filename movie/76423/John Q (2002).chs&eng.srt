2
00:00:42,618 --> 00:00:44,586
[迫在眉梢]

3
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,942
快啊
Come on.

4
00:02:57,253 --> 00:02:59,881
问题在于我们经济成长趋缓
The problem is our economy is slowing down.

5
00:03:00,022 --> 00:03:02,183
大家都很清楚
You all know that as well as anybody does.

6
00:03:02,425 --> 00:03:06,919
也许你或你的朋友都明白
Maybe you or your friends understand what it means to have credit card debt.

7
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,992
什么是信用卡借款
Double that with high energy bills...

8
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,597
再加上每月的高额电费
...there's some people beginning to feel pinched.

9
00:03:12,868 --> 00:03:15,234
有些人已开始觉得日子不好过

10
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:16,497
约翰？
John?

11
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:19,706
怎么了？
Honey, what's wrong?

12
00:03:24,313 --> 00:03:25,245
你们在干嘛？
- What the hell are you doing? - What's it look like?

13
00:03:25,381 --> 00:03:26,109
你说呢？
- That's my car. - That's not what the bank says.

14
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,442
等等，那是我的车

15
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,639
银行不是这么说的
That's my car! Come on!

16
00:03:28,784 --> 00:03:30,251
那是我的车，拜托

17
00:03:30,386 --> 00:03:32,115
赶快缴钱吧
Try paying your bills.

18
00:03:55,411 --> 00:03:56,844
怎么回事啊？
What's going on?

19
00:04:05,254 --> 00:04:08,417
对不起，银行说过会配合我的
I'm sorry.

20
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,650
The bank promised they'd work with me.

21
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:10,319
那是两个月前的事了
John, that was two months ago.

22
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,257
但我们只剩一笔钱缴房租了
I know, but I figured we're down to one last month's rent...

23
00:04:13,362 --> 00:04:15,227
不是车子就是房子，我想K
...it's either the car or the house, so I thought- -

24
00:04:15,398 --> 00:04:16,387
你想
- You thought. - What do you want me to do, baby?

25
00:04:16,665 --> 00:04:17,757
你要我怎么做？
You want to be on the street?

26
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:20,697
你想露宿街头吗？我工时被减

27
00:04:20,836 --> 00:04:24,431
工厂都移到墨西哥，你要我怎样
I'm down to 20 hours at the plant...

28
00:04:21,003 --> 00:04:22,800
...they're shipping all the jobs to Mexico.

29
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:24,168
What do you want me to do?

30
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,868
我的车没了
John, my car is gone!

31
00:04:26,008 --> 00:04:29,136
我知道，我正在设法找兼差
I understand that.

32
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:29,370
I'm trying to find a second job, baby, come on.

33
00:04:29,278 --> 00:04:31,610
你要我说什么？没关系吗？
You want me to say it's fine?

34
00:04:31,714 --> 00:04:33,682
好，没关系
All right, it's fine!

35
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,384
车子还是我们的
And the car is still ours. We own it.

36
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,012
只等下一笔钱进来 等两周就行了
I just got to wait for my next check to come in.

37
00:04:39,555 --> 00:04:41,045
In two weeks we'll be fine.

38
00:04:41,223 --> 00:04:42,520
麦可
Mikey?

39
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:49,629
柯罗尼，奥林匹亚先生
Ronnie Coleman, Mr. Olympia, two years running!

40
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:51,630
连续两年

41
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:53,257
好耶
Yeah!

42
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,903
坐下，小乖，吃早餐
- Sit down, honey. Eat some breakfast. - I am eating.

43
00:04:56,038 --> 00:04:56,663
我在吃啊
- A doughnut isn't breakfast. - It's a continental breakfast.

44
00:04:56,806 --> 00:04:57,864
甜甜圈不算早餐

45
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,838
这是大陆式早餐

46
00:04:59,975 --> 00:05:01,533
我们现在不在大陆上
We're not on a continent right now.

47
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,942
那北美洲算什么？
Dad, what do you call North America?

48
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,913
不吃早餐就别上学，快吃
Enough.

49
00:05:04,713 --> 00:05:06,874
Now you're not going to school till you eat some breakfast, so eat.

50
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,610
两个都一样
Both of you.

51
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,952
那些混蛋竟敢拖走我们的车
I can't believe those jerks took our car.

52
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:14,847
妈，你相信吗？
- Can you, Mom? - No, I can't.

53
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,116
无法置信
What are we going to do?

54
00:05:16,392 --> 00:05:17,654
我们该怎么办？

55
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,953
你会想办法的，对吧，爸？
You're going to do something, right, Dad?

56
00:05:20,496 --> 00:05:21,690
知道我会怎么做吗？
You know what I'd do?

57
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:24,096
我会发狂发狠
I'd get so big and mad,

58
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:25,598
把那些人海扁一顿
I'd just go crazy and kick someone's butt.

59
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:26,464
别乱说话
- Watch your language. - I would.

60
00:05:26,635 --> 00:05:27,294
好
You've been watching too much of that W.W. Wrestling?

61
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,461
你看太多摔角比赛了

62
00:05:29,638 --> 00:05:32,698
不是摔角，是健美
Not wrestling, Dad, bodybuilding.

63
00:05:32,842 --> 00:05:34,275
差别很大的
There's a big difference.

64
00:05:34,643 --> 00:05:36,406
去拿书，你上学要迟到了
Go get your books.

65
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,240
麦克，喝
You're going to be late for school.

66
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:38,407
Mike, pow!

67
00:05:38,781 --> 00:05:39,770
快点，小乖
Hurry up, baby.

68
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:48,154
能送我去上班吗？
Can I get a ride to work?

69
00:06:06,976 --> 00:06:11,072
我爱你
I love you.

70
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:14,716
好，有了
All right, I got a good one.

71
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,786
要是我有个女孩K
If I ever seen a girl, that you- - Go ahead.

72
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:19,751
说吧

73
00:06:20,623 --> 00:06:22,454
是你所爱
That you needed.

74
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:23,455
说啊、说啊
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

75
00:06:23,626 --> 00:06:24,115
点苔
- Ridshin. - Radishes.

76
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:24,851
海苔
No, it's ridshin.

77
00:06:24,994 --> 00:06:26,962
不，是点苔

78
00:06:27,163 --> 00:06:28,289
点状青苔
Reddish stick.

79
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:30,430
是电台
It's radio station.

80
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:32,066
电台，好吧
Radio station, okay.

81
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:33,793
很好，你赢了
It's a good one, you got me.

82
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:39,840
打卤
Hontinin.

83
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,234
打卤？
Hontinin?

84
00:06:42,378 --> 00:06:43,606
打卤
Hontinin.

85
00:06:44,213 --> 00:06:45,510
大卤面？
Hundred dollars?

86
00:06:46,081 --> 00:06:47,708
不，我们早上还提过这个
No, we talked about it this morning. Hontinin.

87
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:48,839
打卤？

88
00:06:50,386 --> 00:06:50,977
大陆
- Honiny? - Continent.

89
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,487
我赢了，对吧？妈咪？

90
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,684
I got you, right? Mom?

91
00:06:54,657 --> 00:06:55,749
你呢，妈咪？
How about you, Mom?

92
00:06:55,891 --> 00:06:56,880
不要
No. No.

93
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,750
来玩嘛
- Come on, baby. - No. You'll just laugh at me.

94
00:06:59,895 --> 00:07:00,919
不，你们会笑我
Come on. Come on, Mommy.

来嘛，妈咪
How about something in the car.

96
00:07:03,065 --> 00:07:04,896
就说车里的东西好了

97
00:07:05,034 --> 00:07:05,864
我们不会笑你的
- We won't laugh at you. Come on. - We won't laugh.

98
00:07:06,001 --> 00:07:07,025
我们不会笑的
Please?

99
00:07:07,203 --> 00:07:08,329
拜托嘛

100
00:07:10,272 --> 00:07:10,704
好吧
All right. But we can't know what you're saying.

101
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,568
你不能说出正确答案
Say it so we don't know. You got to.

102
00:07:12,675 --> 00:07:14,040
你要让我们听不懂

103
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,871
仪表板
Dashboard.

104

你说什么？
What'd you say?

00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,040
我说K
I said...

拜托，快来人把这女人带走吧
Hello? Come get this woman, please?

110
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:36,723
怎么，不好吗？
What, it's no good?

111
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,602
不要这样嘛，宝贝
Come on. Come on, baby.

112
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,838
我跟你玩拇指摔角
I'll thumb-wrestle you.

113
00:07:43,973 --> 00:07:44,803

- You got me. - One, two, three, she wins.

116
00:07:50,246 --> 00:07:51,975
一、二、三，她赢了

117
00:07:52,948 --> 00:07:54,916
我是无敌皇后
I am the gueen.

118
00:07:55,784 --> 00:07:56,876
我想到了
All right, I got one.

119
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,317
我也是，你该上学了
I got one for you. You're going to school.

120
00:07:59,455 --> 00:08:00,217
爸

121
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,648
记得带午餐
Get your lunch.

122
00:08:13,736 --> 00:08:14,293
爸？
Hey, Dad?

123
00:08:14,803 --> 00:08:17,670
我用零用钱存了46元
I got $46 I saved from my allowance.

124
00:08:17,973 --> 00:08:19,338
你若需要可以拿去用
You can have it if you want.

125
00:08:19,475 --> 00:08:20,237
是吗？
We're a family.

126
00:08:20,609 --> 00:08:23,476
我们是一家人，应该要团结
We got to stick together, right?

127
00:08:23,612 --> 00:08:24,738
没错
That's right.

128
00:08:25,347 --> 00:08:27,781
但那是你的钱，好好留着吧
But you earned that money so you keep it, okay?

129
00:08:28,017 --> 00:08:29,348
好，回头见了
All right. See you later.

130
00:08:31,086 --> 00:08:32,075
再见，麦克
- Goodbye, Mike. - Not goodbye, I hate goodbye.

131
00:08:32,321 --> 00:08:34,915
不是再见，我讨厌再见

132
00:08:35,624 --> 00:08:37,922
记得吧？是回头见
Remember? See you later.

133
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:39,592
好，回头见
All right, see you later.

134
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:40,823

你拿了我的砂轮？
Take my frigging grinding wheel?

140
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,578
什么？
What?

141
00:09:35,718 --> 00:09:37,743
你拿了我的砂轮？
- You take my grinding wheel? - I do, don't I?

142
00:09:37,886 --> 00:09:38,910
是啊，没错
- You do? - Yeah, have sex appeal.

143
00:09:39,054 --> 00:09:39,679
真的？

144
00:09:39,822 --> 00:09:41,153
是啊，乱性感的

145
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,188
不，它不见了，我的砂轮
No, it's not in my locker, my grinding wheel.

146
00:09:44,326 --> 00:09:45,452
你要我的吗？
Do you want mine?

00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:48,460
只有两个人知道我柜子的密码
Now, only two people know the combination to my locker, John.

148
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,723
那是我的砂轮，你很清楚
That's my grinder and you know it.

149
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:54,292
约翰，我去抽烟
John! John! Smoke, all right?

150
00:10:00,008 --> 00:10:01,703
干嘛打领带？有人死了？
What's with the frigging tie? Somebody die?

151
00:10:01,844 --> 00:10:02,538
喜欢吗？
You like that?

152
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:05,238
若我今天没法子得到这工作
That's the tie I'll be wearing to my funeral

153
00:10:05,381 --> 00:10:06,643
我死的时候就打这条领带
if I don't get this job today.

154
00:10:06,782 --> 00:10:08,181
什么工作？没工作的
What job? There're no jobs.

155
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,376
报上登的，他们在征人
I saw it in the classifieds, they're hiring.

156
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,486
别傻了
Forget about it.

157
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,552
我非去不可
- I got to go, though. - Yeah, how come?

158
00:10:12,688 --> 00:10:13,586
为什么？
Denise will kill me. They repod her car this morning.

159
00:10:14,022 --> 00:10:16,354
狄妮会杀了我，她的车被吊了

160
00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:17,789
天啊
Oh, boy.

161
00:10:18,861 --> 00:10:20,055
要我陪你去吗？
- You want me to go with you? - Come on.

162
00:10:20,195 --> 00:10:20,718
走吧

163
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,827
我的钱、50分耶
Fifty cents! Fifty cents!

164
00:10:27,403 --> 00:10:28,700
这是浪费时间
This is a frigging waste of time.

165
00:10:29,772 --> 00:10:32,866
四百人应征一个工作，拜托
Four hundred people for one job?

166
00:10:31,373 --> 00:10:33,068
One job? Give me a break.

167
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:36,409
一定早内定用谁的儿子、亲戚了
Guarantee somebody's son, cousin, uncle already got this job sewn up.

168
00:10:36,545 --> 00:10:38,979
他们若不想雇人，干嘛登报？
Why'd they put it in the paper if they're not hiring, Jimmy?

169
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:40,706
那只是幌子
It's the frigging runaround.

170
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:44,250
他们会说：会将你的资料建档
You mark my words, it's either:

171
00:10:42,317 --> 00:10:43,807
"We'll keep your application on file..."

172
00:10:44,386 --> 00:10:46,320
不然就会说，你超过标准
...or they'll tell you: "You're overqualified."

173
00:10:46,455 --> 00:10:48,719
不管怎样，他们不会用你
Either way, they'll screw you.

174
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:50,089
亚契先生？
Archibald

175
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:50,953
是的
Yes

176
00:10:51,093 --> 00:10:52,025
约翰？
John

177
00:10:56,665 --> 00:10:59,532
我在重工业做了15年
I have been working heavy machine for 15 years.

178
00:11:00,602 --> 00:11:03,435
我需要这工作，我什么都能做
I really want the job.

179
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,595
Everything you want I can do.

180
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:04,628
我了解
I see

181
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:09,033
若有必要，我可以今天就上工
I can start today if you, you know, you need.

182
00:11:10,846 --> 00:11:12,871
你的履历令人印象深刻
Well, your resume is very impressive.

183
00:11:13,015 --> 00:11:15,381
你的确很有经验
You certainly got the experience.

184
00:11:16,685 --> 00:11:20,382
老实说，你也许超过标准
Frankly, you may be overqualified.

185
00:11:21,023 --> 00:11:23,355
但我们会把你的资料建档
But, we'll keep your application on file.

186
00:11:25,928 --> 00:11:31,195
耶稣爱我，我知道
Jesus loves me this I know.

187
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,636
圣经如此告诉我
For the Bible tells me so...

188
00:11:35,704 --> 00:11:36,671
爸？
Dad?

189
00:11:37,206 --> 00:11:40,972
再15分就要比赛了，我们会迟到
The game starts in 15 minutes.

190
00:11:39,508 --> 00:11:41,066
We're going to be late.

191
00:11:41,109 --> 00:11:49,414
他们孱弱，但他强壮

192
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:49,979
They are weak but he is strong.

193
00:11:50,018 --> 00:11:55,081
是的，耶稣爱我
Yes, Jesus loves me!

194
00:11:55,557 --> 00:12:00,426
圣经如此告诉我
The Bible tells me so

195
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,596
红不让，宝贝，红不让
Knock it out, baby, knock it out!

196
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:08,431
加油，汤米

197
00:12:09,204 --> 00:12:10,466
Come on, Tommy!

198
00:12:16,478 --> 00:12:17,604
四坏球
Ball four!

199
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,608
加油，麦克，加油

200
00:12:22,684 --> 00:12:27,053
Let's go, Mikey! Let's go, baby! Let's go, son!

201
00:12:24,486 --> 00:12:27,114
加油，儿子

202
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:29,886
红不让、红不让
Knock it out! Knock it out!

203
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:34,018
压低头盯住球，儿子

204
00:12:31,993 --> 00:12:34,291
Keep your head down on the ball, son. Head down on the ball.

205
00:12:34,396 --> 00:12:36,626
为妈咪挥大棒吧，加油，麦克
Knock it out for your mama, baby! Come on, Mikey!

206
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,060

207
00:12:38,734 --> 00:12:41,066
Come on, Mikey!

208
00:12:43,906 --> 00:12:44,770
好球
Strike!

209
00:12:44,907 --> 00:12:46,135
别担心，儿子
- Don't worry about it, son. - What're you blind?

210
00:12:46,275 --> 00:12:47,469
你瞎了啊
Keep your head down on the ball!

211
00:12:47,676 --> 00:12:48,904
压低头盯住球

212
00:12:49,044 --> 00:12:50,443
这投手真讨厌，他几岁？
- He's supposed pitcher. How old is he?

213
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:51,477
应该快12岁了
Twelve, my ass. Look at him.

214
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,511
12岁个头，看看他

215
00:12:53,715 --> 00:12:55,740
他连胡子都长出来了
His beard grew an inch between pitches.

216
00:12:55,884 --> 00:12:56,714
加油，麦克
- Let's go, Mikey! - For your mama, baby!

217
00:12:56,852 --> 00:12:58,046
为妈咪加把劲
Put your elbow up, son! Elbow up!

218
00:12:58,186 --> 00:12:59,448
手肘抬起来，儿子

219
00:13:04,426 --> 00:13:05,825
安全上垒
Safe.

220
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:07,856
跑者得点
Tie goes to the runner.

221
00:13:09,264 --> 00:13:13,394
快跑、快跑

222
00:13:11,266 --> 00:13:13,666
Run! Run! Run! Run!

223
00:13:17,873 --> 00:13:22,207
Second base!

224
00:13:21,143 --> 00:13:22,132
二垒

225
00:13:25,948 --> 00:13:26,937
麦克
Mike!

226
00:13:29,084 --> 00:13:29,948
怎么回事？
What happened?

227
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:31,279
天啊
Jesus.

228
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:35,957
快叫救护车
Mike

229
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:36,115
Somebody call an ambulance!

230
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:40,290
快叫救护车啊
Somebody call a frigging ambulance!

231
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:48,736
吉米，他不会有事吧？
All right, Jimmy. Is he going to be okay?

232
00:13:52,674 --> 00:13:56,405
求求你，麦克，快开车
Come on, Mikey! Go!

233
00:14:30,312 --> 00:14:31,142
救命啊
- Help us! - Help! Help, please, somebody!

234
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,769
救命，快来人啊
He can't breathe, he's not breathing!

235
00:14:32,981 --> 00:14:34,744
他没法呼吸，他没呼吸了

236
00:14:34,883 --> 00:14:36,248
好，跟我来
All right, come with me.

237
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:40,381
他在跑向二垒的时候昏倒了
He was running to second base. He fell over.

238
00:14:40,522 --> 00:14:43,320
我需要医师支援

239
00:14:42,023 --> 00:14:43,820
I need a doctor right away please!

240
00:14:44,826 --> 00:14:45,622
天啊
Oh, Jesus!

241
00:14:45,694 --> 00:14:47,127
麦克？麦克
Mikey.

242
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:47,751
怎么回事？
- What happened? - He crashed playing baseball.

243
00:14:47,896 --> 00:14:49,090
他在打棒球时昏倒
- Get him on some oxygen.

244
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:50,196
给他氧气
He's going to be all right, isn't he?

245
00:14:50,332 --> 00:14:52,095
他不会有事吧？

246
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:54,464
醒醒，我是你妈
Wake up. Here's your mama.

247
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,398
以前发生过吗？
- This ever happen before? - No, ma'am.

248
00:14:55,537 --> 00:14:56,060
没有
- Any allergies? - No, nothing!

249
00:14:56,238 --> 00:14:56,897
他有过敏吗？

250
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:57,869
没，都没有
- No medications the past year? - Nothing!

251
00:14:58,006 --> 00:14:59,064

没有
- Allergies to medication? - No, he's fine!

253
00:15:00,142 --> 00:15:00,836
对药物过敏？

254
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:02,341
没有，他很好
He just fell down.

255
00:15:02,477 --> 00:15:03,774
他只是昏倒
His liver's enlarged. Flip him, please.

256
00:15:03,912 --> 00:15:05,004
他的肝肿大，把他翻过去
He's going to be all right, isn't ge?!

257
00:15:05,147 --> 00:15:06,614

260
00:15:10,252 --> 00:15:11,583
他到底怎么了？
- What is the matter with him?! - Would you come with me, please?

261
00:15:11,687 --> 00:15:13,052
请跟我来好吗？
There are a few procedures we need to go over.

262
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,119
你们有些手续要办

263
00:15:15,257 --> 00:15:16,019
什么手续？
- What kind of procedures? - We'll be admitting your son.

264
00:15:16,158 --> 00:15:17,489
我们要让他入院
You need to fill out the proper forms.

265
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:18,820
你们得填一些表格
What kind of forms?

266
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,722
什么表格？
Your son may need a blood transfusion.

What?

269

我们要帮你们验血，好吗？

270
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,100
麦克，我们马上回来，小乖
Mikey, we're coming right back, baby!

271
00:15:26,234 --> 00:15:27,030

278
00:15:40,082 --> 00:15:42,312
还不知道，我们在等检验结果
We don't know yet.

279
00:15:40,548 --> 00:15:42,448
They're running tests. We're waiting for the results.

280
00:15:42,451 --> 00:15:44,043
我们能帮得上忙吗？
Is there anything we can do?

00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:48,714
你的保险卡
I need to make a copy for our files.

00:15:48,857 --> 00:15:51,052
我要影印建档

286

没关系，你们可以进去了
It's okay, you can go in.

小乖
Hey, sweetheart.

你好吗，强棒王？
How you doing, slugger?

我不能说话
I can't talk.

290
00:16:42,644 --> 00:16:43,338
别担心
Don't worry about it. Get your rest, buddy.

291
00:16:43,478 --> 00:16:46,606
好好休息，我们等一下就走

00:16:56,792 --> 00:16:58,692
这些是什么？
What is all this?

296
00:16:59,027 --> 00:17:00,016
这个？
This?

297
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:01,889
这监视麦克的生命征象
This monitors Mike's vitals.

298
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,156
呼吸率、血氧率
Respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, heart rate.

299
00:17:04,332 --> 00:17:05,424
心跳率

300
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,258
这个是血压
And this one is blood pressure.

301
00:17:08,036 --> 00:17:10,163
舒张压和收缩压
Diastolic and systolic.

302
00:17:10,305 --> 00:17:12,967
希望这数字能维持在90以上
We'd like this top number to stay above 90.

303
00:17:13,275 --> 00:17:16,142
要设法不让他血压下降
If his blood pressure drops, we'll have to do something.

304
00:17:16,278 --> 00:17:18,269
不能再低于70
He can't go below 70 again.

305
00:17:18,613 --> 00:17:22,572
为什么？低于70会怎样？
Why? What would that mean if he went below 70 again?

306
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,985
低于70，他就会心脏衰竭
Seventy and below, he's in heart failure.

307
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:29,981
好
Okay.

308
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,114
若有任何需要K
- Lf you need anything... - Thank you.

309
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,226
谢谢你

310
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:40,593
这家人的保险情况？
How's the family insurance?

311
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:42,760
他做兼职工作
He works part-time.

312
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:44,906
她则是商店店员
She works as a grocery store clerk.

313
00:17:45,073 --> 00:17:46,040
我们能怎么做？
Can we do anything?

314
00:17:46,174 --> 00:17:47,334
我得挂了
I got to go.

315
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,903
亚契先生、太太
Mr. And Mr. S Archibald.

316
00:17:51,046 --> 00:17:52,206
你们好，我是医院总监潘芮贝
Hello, I'm Rebecca Payne, hospital director.

317
00:17:52,347 --> 00:17:53,109
你好
- Hi. - Hi, there.

318
00:17:53,248 --> 00:17:53,976
你好
Nice to meet you.

319
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:54,774
幸会
This is Dr. Turner, the head of Cardiology and Michael's doctor.

320
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,383
这位是透纳医师，心脏科主任

321
00:17:56,518 --> 00:17:57,507
也是麦克的主治医师

322
00:17:57,652 --> 00:17:59,517
你好
- How do you do? - Good. My wife.

323
00:17:59,721 --> 00:18:01,348
很好，我太太

324
00:18:01,656 --> 00:18:03,055
我儿子怎样了？
How's our boy doing?

325
00:18:04,326 --> 00:18:05,691
请坐
Please sit down.

326
00:18:23,612 --> 00:18:24,601
好
Ok.

327
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:30,644
这张是正常9岁男孩的心脏
This x-ray shows a normal nine-year-old's heart.

328
00:18:31,052 --> 00:18:34,078
这张是你儿子麦克的心脏
This x-ray is that of your son, Michael.

329
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:38,854
心房间隔有破洞
There are septal defects...

330
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:41,326
这里、这里、和这里
...here, here, and here...

331
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:43,964
这导致心肌病变，引发肺水肿
...which have induced myopathy, resulting pulmonary edema...

332
00:18:44,132 --> 00:18:46,032
以及恶性心室异位
...and malignant ventricular ectopy.

333
00:18:46,301 --> 00:18:47,268
所以，各位可以看到
So, you can see.

334
00:18:47,435 --> 00:18:50,427
麦克的心脏比正常人要大三倍
Michael's heart is approximately three times larger than normal size.

335
00:18:50,639 --> 00:18:51,697
对不起
I'm sorry.

336
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:54,767
我听不懂
I didn't understand you.

337
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,208
能不能说简单一点
Could you put that in layman terms for me?

338
00:18:57,445 --> 00:18:58,605
基本上
Basically...

339
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,740
麦克的心脏无法抽取足够血液
There's not enough blood being pumped by Michael's heart...

340
00:19:01,883 --> 00:19:04,545
所以血液会回流到肺部
...so it backs up in the lungs like a sponge getting wet.

341
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:06,143
逐渐堆积在里面

342
00:19:06,821 --> 00:19:10,382
他的心脏很努力，但徒劳无功
His heart is trying, but it's working too hard.

343
00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:13,628
他需要什么，手术吗？
What does he need, an operation or?

344
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,960
他的心脏需要的不是一般手术
We're considerably beyond corrective surgery,

345
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:20,931
他的心脏毫无功用
Mr. And Mrs. Archibald.

346
00:19:19,801 --> 00:19:21,598
Mike's heart is useless.

347
00:19:21,603 --> 00:19:24,401
他需要心脏移植，否则就完了
He needs a transplant, or he'll die.

348
00:19:27,142 --> 00:19:29,770
等等，还有别的选择
Wait a second.

349
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:30,843
什么选择？
There are other options.

350
00:19:30,011 --> 00:19:31,501
What options?

351
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,647
顺其自然，用药物治疗他
To do nothing. Medicate him.

352
00:19:34,816 --> 00:19:36,306
尽量让他过的舒适一点
Make him as comfortable as possible.

353
00:19:36,451 --> 00:19:39,079
仔细考虑生活品质
You'll have to think about quality of life.

354
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,847
我不懂
I don't understand.

355
00:19:41,823 --> 00:19:43,415
他原来还好好的
We were just with him and he seemed fine.

356
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,820
他看起来还是会很好

357
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:48,555
但随着他的心脏恶化
He's going to seem fine.

358
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,960
他会变得越来越累
But as his heart gets worse, he'll become increasingly fatigued.

359
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:52,961
他也会越睡越多
And he will sleep more and more.

360
00:19:53,868 --> 00:19:55,995
有一天他会睡着
Until one day he will fall asleep...

361
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:58,733
然后不再醒来
...and he won't wake up.

362
00:20:00,442 --> 00:20:01,932
我知道这很困难
I know this is difficult...

363
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:04,409
但你们必须面对事实
...but you have to face the fact that your son may not live much longer.

364
00:20:04,546 --> 00:20:06,514
你们的儿子可能活不久

365
00:20:06,648 --> 00:20:10,175
你们该快乐过日子，好好道别
You might want to make it a happy time, say goodbye.

366
00:20:11,453 --> 00:20:12,886
天啊
God.

367
00:20:13,121 --> 00:20:16,022
心脏移植是高危险的手术
Transplantation is a high-risk operation.

368
00:20:16,157 --> 00:20:19,092
你们可能在手术台上失去他
You could lose your son on that table.

369
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:19,226
You might not want to take that chance.

370
00:20:21,863 --> 00:20:25,822
你们也许并不想冒那个险
If you, you know, if he doesn't have the surgery...

371
00:20:30,739 --> 00:20:32,229
要是他不做手术
If he doesn't have the surgery, how long would he live?

372
00:20:32,407 --> 00:20:33,704
不做手术，他能活多久？

373
00:20:33,842 --> 00:20:34,672
不会很久
Not long.

374
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:36,276
几个月、几周
Months, weeks.

375
00:20:37,178 --> 00:20:38,611
几天
Days.

376
00:20:39,381 --> 00:20:40,109
老天爷
God.

377
00:20:40,248 --> 00:20:43,684
别哭，宝贝，不会有事的
Come on, baby. All right, all right, baby.

378
00:20:43,818 --> 00:20:45,251
别哭了
Come on, now.

379
00:20:53,161 --> 00:20:54,753
很抱歉
I'm sorry, it's- -

380
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:58,356
这太沉重了
It's a lot.

381
00:21:10,712 --> 00:21:12,612
我会陪着你的
I'll be there.

382
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:14,911
好吧
All right.

383
00:21:16,785 --> 00:21:17,774
好
Okay.

384
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,918
他若是你儿子，你会怎么做？
If he was your son, what would you do?

385
00:21:23,858 --> 00:21:25,826
我会做移植手术，毫无疑问
I'd do the transplant, absolutely.

386
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,949
好吧
Okay.

387
00:21:28,096 --> 00:21:29,256
好吗？
Okay?

388
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:34,095
好，就做吧，做手术
Okay, let's do that. Let's do it.

389
00:21:34,803 --> 00:21:35,201
真的？
- Yes? - Yes.

390
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:36,030
真的
Ok.

391
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:36,933
好

392
00:21:37,772 --> 00:21:40,798
首先让麦克排上等待移植名单
First, we've got to get Mike on the organ recipient list.

393
00:21:40,942 --> 00:21:43,843
他血型B型阳性，可以排第一
He's B-positive, so he should go right to the top of the list.

394
00:21:43,978 --> 00:21:45,240
没这么简单
It's not so simple.

395
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,870
还有其他考量
There are other considerations...

396
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,983
在接受移植者登上名单之前
...before a prospective recipient can be placed on a donor list.

397
00:21:49,117 --> 00:21:52,553
器官移植手术很花钱
Transplant surgery is very expensive.

398
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:54,784
大多都是贵的吓人
In most cases, prohibitively so.

399
00:21:54,923 --> 00:21:56,356
我们有保险
We've got insurance.

400
00:21:56,491 --> 00:21:58,152
我有重大疾病保险，他有纳保
I mean, I got major medical. He's covered.

401
00:21:58,293 --> 00:22:00,625
我们跟你的保险公司查过
We've checked with your carrier, Mr. Archibald.

402
00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:03,762
你的保险不包括这种大手术
There are no provisions in your policy for a procedure of this magnitude.

403
00:22:03,932 --> 00:22:06,799
不、不K你弄错了
Oh, no, no, no, no.

404
00:22:06,935 --> 00:22:08,402
我不是说你错了
That's a mistake.

405
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:08,392
Not that you're making the mistake.

406
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:11,437
我是说我的确有保险
I'm just saying that I'm insured.

407
00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:13,038
我儿子有保险
My son's covered.

408
00:22:13,441 --> 00:22:14,601
你呢，亚契太太？
How about you, Mrs. Archibald.

409
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:15,437
你有保险吗？
Do you have coverage?

410
00:22:15,643 --> 00:22:19,636
不，我才刚上班几个月K
No, I've only been at the supermarket a few months,

411
00:22:19,781 --> 00:22:21,942
那不重要，我们有保险
and you don't get benefits- -

412
00:22:19,914 --> 00:22:22,508
Doesn't matter, we got insurance.

413
00:22:24,786 --> 00:22:27,482
好吧，我知道你没有房产
Okay, I can see here that you don't own your home.

414
00:22:27,922 --> 00:22:30,618
没有股票、债换蛲蹲
You've no stocks, no bonds, no investments.

415
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:32,521
你们有大约一千元的存款
You have a little over $1000 in savings.

416
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,127
但我们有保险
But we got insurance.

417
00:22:34,262 --> 00:22:36,093
那很好，亚契先生
That may be, very well.

418
00:22:36,264 --> 00:22:38,255
你去跟你的保险公司查清楚
Archibald, you'll have to check withy your carrier on that.

419
00:22:38,433 --> 00:22:40,594
同时，我们只收现金
In the meantime, we'll have to treat this as a cash account.

420
00:22:40,702 --> 00:22:41,794
什么？
What?

421
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:42,937
器官移植要多少钱？
- How much does a transplant cost? - Wait a minute, baby, let me- -

422
00:22:43,104 --> 00:22:44,469
等等，让我K
How much does it cost?

423
00:22:44,672 --> 00:22:46,537
要多少钱？

424
00:22:47,675 --> 00:22:49,267
移植手术、医师费、
Transplant surgery, doctors' fees, postoperative care...

425
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,004
术后疗养费、抗排斥药
...immunosuppressant drugs...

426
00:22:52,147 --> 00:22:55,139
至少需要二十五万
...you're looking at a minimum of $250,000.

427
00:22:55,517 --> 00:22:58,645
若你们选择器官移植手术
If you opt for transplant surgery, that is your choice.

428
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,812
就要这么多
But the hospital maintains a very strict

429
00:22:59,954 --> 00:23:02,388
但医院对于必须付现的病患
policy with regard to cash patients.

430
00:23:02,524 --> 00:23:03,957
有严格的规定

431
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:07,061
在把病患名列等待移植名单前
We require a down payment before

432
00:23:07,195 --> 00:23:08,753
我们要求先付头款
we put a patient's name on a receiver's list.

433
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:09,821
那是多少？
- How much? - What kind of down payment?

434
00:23:09,998 --> 00:23:10,965
什么样的头款？
Thirty percent.

435
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:12,157
三成

436
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:13,957
七万五千元
Seventy-five thousand dollars.

437
00:23:14,302 --> 00:23:16,270
七万五千元
Seventy-five thousand dollars...

438
00:23:18,873 --> 00:23:20,602
就为了把我儿子的名字放上去
...to put my son's name on a list.

439
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:23,768
我儿子病危，你却满嘴铜臭
Our son is dying and all you can do is talk about money?

440
00:23:23,912 --> 00:23:26,210
医疗是有成本的
It costs money to provide health care.

441
00:23:27,048 --> 00:23:29,608
你们花钱，我们也要花钱
It's expensive for you, it's expensive for us.

442
00:23:29,684 --> 00:23:30,378
很抱歉
Now, I'm sorry.

443
00:23:30,518 --> 00:23:34,010
你们得保证在安排名单前付款
You'll have to guarantee payment before I can put your son's name on the list.

444
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:39,624
亚契先生、太太，请等一下
Mr. And Mrs. Archibald? Please wait!

445
00:23:41,996 --> 00:23:43,588
要是你们不医，可以
If you people won't treat us, fine.

446
00:23:43,731 --> 00:23:45,096
我们带他去公立医院
We'll take him to County Memorial.

447
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:46,257
相信我，别那么做
You don't want to do that.

448
00:23:46,434 --> 00:23:47,958
公立医院必须救治他
It's a county hospital. They have to treat him.

449
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:49,103
他们不行
No, they don't.

450
00:23:49,237 --> 00:23:52,331
心脏移植是选择性手术
Heart transplantation is considered an elective procedure.

451
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:54,464
相信我，来这里绝对没错
Believe me, you're in the right place.

452
00:23:54,676 --> 00:23:55,768
那我们该怎么办？
What are we supposed to do?

453
00:23:56,077 --> 00:23:57,704
再去跟你们的保险公司谈谈
You talk to your insurance company again.

454
00:23:57,845 --> 00:24:00,473
找我们人力资源部请求资助
Check with our Human Resources office for medical assistance.

455
00:24:00,682 --> 00:24:01,376
他们有钱
There's money.

456
00:24:01,516 --> 00:24:03,984
去儿童福利局，申请医疗补助
There's Children Stats Services and there's Medicaid.

457
00:24:04,118 --> 00:24:06,348
找办法让他留在这里
You find a way to keep him here.

458
00:24:06,621 --> 00:24:08,418
不要接受任何人的拒绝
You don't take no for an answer.

459
00:24:10,758 --> 00:24:14,125
你的保单变更过了，亚契先生
Your policy has changed, Mr. Archibald.

460
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:16,258
变更什么？
Changed to what?

461
00:24:17,131 --> 00:24:19,599
我们最近更换了承保组织
We've recently switched carriers from a PPO to an HMO.

462
00:24:19,701 --> 00:24:21,168
从PPO改为HMO
It's less expensive but unfortunately there are some restrictions.

463
00:24:21,302 --> 00:24:22,599
那比较便宜

464
00:24:22,704 --> 00:24:25,639
但很不幸地，他们的限制较多

465
00:24:25,773 --> 00:24:27,001
什么限制？
What kind of restrictions?

466
00:24:27,141 --> 00:24:28,335
情况是这样的
Here's how it works.

467
00:24:28,977 --> 00:24:31,912
非管理阶层、兼职员工，像你
Non-management, part-time employees, such as yourself...

468
00:24:32,046 --> 00:24:35,607
只能得到第二级的巨灾保障
...only qualify for second-tier catastrophic coverage.

469
00:24:35,717 --> 00:24:37,048
我是全职不是兼职
No, I'm not part-time, I'm full-time.

470
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:39,050
是工厂生意不好
It's just slow now.

471
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:39,881
没错
Sure.

472
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:43,684
但你的保险以工时为计算基础
But your coverage is based on hours worked...

473
00:24:43,825 --> 00:24:46,293
我说过，你只能得到第二级保障
...and like I said, you only qualify for second tier...

474
00:24:46,427 --> 00:24:49,225
保险给付最高是二万元
...and that has a maximum payout limit of $20,000.

475
00:24:49,397 --> 00:24:50,421
什么？
What?

476
00:24:53,301 --> 00:24:55,428
公司每周按时扣我的款
You take money out of my check every week.

477
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,501
我付保险费已经付好几年了
I've been paying into this policy for years...

478
00:24:57,672 --> 00:24:58,400
没错
Right, and that's why we'll cover you for the full 20.

479
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:01,099
所以我们会全额给付二万元

480
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:05,239
你骗我，对吧？
You're kidding me, right? I mean, come on.

481
00:25:06,748 --> 00:25:10,707
你是说你改变了我的承保条件
You're telling me that you've dropped me

482
00:25:10,852 --> 00:25:12,183
你们换了承保组织
from full-time to part-time.

483
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,652
却告诉我，我保障不够？
You switched carriers.

484
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:14,786
Now you're telling me that I'm not fully covered?

485
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:17,485
就算我手上保单说我有保障？
Even though I got a policy that says I am?

486
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,127
这似乎不太对，对吧？
- It doesn't seem right. - No, it doesn't seem right.

487
00:25:20,261 --> 00:25:21,228
没错
My son is very sick.

488
00:25:21,362 --> 00:25:22,829
我儿子命在旦夕

489
00:25:23,131 --> 00:25:24,928
要是我没保险，问题就大了
If I'm not covered, I got a serious problem.

490
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:28,557
我明白，但我无能为力
I understand that.

491
00:25:27,168 --> 00:25:28,760
But there's nothing I can do.

492
00:25:28,703 --> 00:25:30,603
听着，你可以上诉
- You can file an appeal. - Yeah?

493
00:25:30,705 --> 00:25:31,603
是吗？
Here you go.

494
00:25:31,806 --> 00:25:32,773
拿去

495
00:25:33,274 --> 00:25:35,504
那要费时约七个工作天
That takes about seven working days.

496
00:25:35,643 --> 00:25:37,804
“约翰Q(父亲）”

497
00:25:37,945 --> 00:25:40,607
“总薪金(税前）$18，200”

498
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:53,423
上面写你们已经有医疗保险了
Says here you already have medical insurance.

499
00:25:53,561 --> 00:25:54,186
那不够
Not enough.

500
00:25:54,329 --> 00:25:56,593
我们仅有的保险给付已经用尽
What little we have is already used up.

501
00:25:57,065 --> 00:25:58,032
有接受政府救济吗？
- You on welfare? - No.

502
00:25:58,166 --> 00:25:59,064
没有

503
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,166
你们应该接受的
You should be on welfare.

504
00:26:01,302 --> 00:26:03,031
救济？我们都有工作啊
Welfare? We both have jobs.

505
00:26:03,171 --> 00:26:04,399
那真是太糟了
That's too bad.

506
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:06,903
抱歉，我帮不上忙
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

507
00:26:07,308 --> 00:26:09,003
去找郡政府要医疗补助吧
Try County Medical.

508
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:11,802
我要找承办财务补助的人员
I need to speak to somebody in financial aid.

509
00:26:13,514 --> 00:26:14,845
我不想等
I don't want to hold.

510
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:17,847
我已等15分钟了，我不要等
I've been holding for 15 minutes.

511
00:26:16,817 --> 00:26:18,114
I don't want to hold.

512
00:26:23,191 --> 00:26:24,283
我没有吼
- I'm not yelling! - Yes, you yelling in here!

513
00:26:24,425 --> 00:26:25,619
有，你在里面吼

514
00:26:33,935 --> 00:26:34,833
下一位
Next, please.

515
00:26:40,108 --> 00:26:42,201
排错了，15号窗口
Wrong line. Number 15.

516
00:26:42,443 --> 00:26:43,341
什么？
What?

517
00:26:43,711 --> 00:26:44,871
15号窗口
Window 15...

518
00:27:03,631 --> 00:27:04,427
不行
No.

519
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:05,256
不行什么？
- No, what? - No, you don't qualify.

520
00:27:05,433 --> 00:27:07,230
不行，你资格不符

521
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,135
我儿子病危，我破产
My son's dying, I'm broke.

522
00:27:09,303 --> 00:27:10,395
要是我不够资格，谁够？
If I don't quality, who does?

523
00:27:10,605 --> 00:27:11,264
很抱歉
- I'm sorry. - You're sorry?

524
00:27:11,406 --> 00:27:11,929
你抱歉？
I don't need you to be sorry.

525
00:27:12,106 --> 00:27:14,438
我不需要你抱歉，我要你帮我
I need you to help me?

526
00:27:26,954 --> 00:27:28,683
“奈曼机械”

527
00:27:28,823 --> 00:27:31,690
“您的上诉申请已获准”

528
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,868
不对，这是上诉
No, no, no, this is an appeal.

529
00:27:43,137 --> 00:27:45,435
上诉是针对已申请的理赔案件
An appeal is for an already existing claim.

530
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,608
你要提出的是申诉
You needed to file a grievance.

531
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,699
你弄错了
You filed the wrong paperwork.

532
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:52,604
你得重提申诉，这得耗30天
Wait... You'll have to resubmit.

533
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:53,737
我没有30天可耗
It could take 30 days.

534
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:54,609
我知道
- I don't have 30 days. - I know.

535
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,342
我听够藉口了
I'm sick of the runaround.

536
00:27:56,484 --> 00:27:58,349
我要让我儿子排上那个名单
What I need is my son's name on that list.

537
00:27:58,486 --> 00:28:02,547
你们尚欠三万元医药费
Your account is in excess of $30,000.

538
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:05,457
医院已经尽量通融你们了
The hospital has bent over backwards to help you out.

539
00:28:05,593 --> 00:28:06,184
是吗？
- Is that right? - Yes, it is right.

540
00:28:06,327 --> 00:28:07,123
没错

541
00:28:07,261 --> 00:28:09,855
但我们的慷慨是有限度的
But, there's a limit to our generosity.

542
00:28:10,698 --> 00:28:14,134
总之，你的保险没用
Once and for all, your insurance does not cover this.

543
00:28:34,121 --> 00:28:35,281
拿去吧
Take it.

544
00:28:35,523 --> 00:28:35,989
小心
Watch your step.

545
00:28:36,123 --> 00:28:36,987
这玩意真重
This thing is frigging heavy!

546
00:28:37,124 --> 00:28:38,250
别挡路

547
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:43,423
Get out of the way.

548
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:38,949
“你不能说你不要投球K”
"You can't say that you're not going to pitch."

549
00:29:40,121 --> 00:29:42,351
可以了
Hey. It's okay.

550
00:29:44,725 --> 00:29:46,317
Let us pray.

551
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,894
我们祈祷吧
God of mercy into whose hands your son, Jesus Christ...

552
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,425
慈爱的天父派遣其子耶稣
...commended his spirit at his last hour.

553
00:29:51,632 --> 00:29:54,499
在死前交付了他的灵魂

554
00:29:54,635 --> 00:29:56,068
在它手中
Into those same hand, we commend your servant Tiffany.

555
00:29:56,203 --> 00:29:58,967
我们颂扬您的仆人蒂芬妮

556
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:03,003
你该去找那个记者
You should try that news guy,

557
00:30:03,144 --> 00:30:05,510
他专做特别报导的
does all the special investigative reports.

558
00:30:05,646 --> 00:30:08,012
那个头发超整齐的家伙
The guy with the frigging hair.

559
00:30:08,149 --> 00:30:09,980
自恋狂，他叫什么来着？
Pretty boy, what's his frigging name?

560
00:30:10,117 --> 00:30:10,640
姓蓝
- Lampley. - Tuck Lampley.

561
00:30:10,785 --> 00:30:12,184
蓝塔克
Give you $20 for the TV.

562
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,678
20元买电视

563
00:30:15,056 --> 00:30:15,920
那是彩色电视耶
- It's a color TV. - Twenty dollars.

564
00:30:16,057 --> 00:30:17,115
20元

565
00:30:22,163 --> 00:30:23,130
就找他吧，吉米
Call him up, Jimmy.

566
00:30:23,297 --> 00:30:26,289
边走边谈，我很忙，快
Mind if we walk and talk, I'm up to here today.

567
00:30:26,467 --> 00:30:27,399
没关系
Go, go, go.

568
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:28,695
我能帮上什么忙？
Not at all.

569
00:30:27,568 --> 00:30:28,626
So, what can I do you for?

570
00:30:29,136 --> 00:30:31,070
我儿子麦克
My son, Mike.

571
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:33,264
他打棒球时心脏病发
He fell into heart failure at his little league game.

572
00:30:33,407 --> 00:30:36,865
我公司本来有给我全额保险
No I got full insurance from the job.

573
00:30:37,011 --> 00:30:38,501
但他们现在却说不能付钱
Now, they're telling me they won't pay.

574
00:30:38,646 --> 00:30:41,137
医院呢？他们不能帮忙吗？
What about the hospital?

575
00:30:41,282 --> 00:30:44,115
不，他们还叫我要付现
Don't they have to cover it?

576
00:30:41,949 --> 00:30:44,144
No, they're telling me I got to pay cash.

577
00:30:44,251 --> 00:30:46,845
不然我就得眼睁睁看儿子死
Otherwise, I got to take my son home and watch him die.

578
00:30:46,988 --> 00:30:47,613
老天爷
Jesus. Yeah.

579
00:30:47,755 --> 00:30:48,312
是啊
We were thinking you could do one of those special-interest pieces.

580
00:30:48,456 --> 00:30:51,050
我们想也许你能做个特别报导

581
00:30:51,192 --> 00:30:53,387
呼吁捐款、写信给国会议员
Send donations, write your congressman- -

582
00:30:53,527 --> 00:30:56,553
只要你能帮忙，任何忙都行
Anything you can do, Mr. Lampley, would help. Anything.

583
00:30:57,198 --> 00:30:59,792
你儿子的事太惨了，我想帮忙
What's happening to your son is outrageous and I want to help.

584
00:30:59,967 --> 00:31:01,400
但我得照规矩来
I got to run this by my producers.

585
00:31:01,535 --> 00:31:03,002
我跟大家一样都有老板
I got bosses like everybody else.

586
00:31:03,137 --> 00:31:04,195
没错、没错
Right, right.

587
00:31:04,372 --> 00:31:06,897
留个电话给凯伦，就在前面
Leave your number with Karen, up front?

588
00:31:07,341 --> 00:31:09,605
好，谢谢你
Okay. Thank you very much. Okay.

589
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:27,421
出给我一百，一百吧
Give me $100. Give me 100.

590
00:31:27,628 --> 00:31:29,493
拜托，那是钻戒耶
Come on, it's a diamond ring.

591
00:31:29,997 --> 00:31:31,988
好吧，90，给我90
All right, $90. Give me 90.

592
00:31:58,259 --> 00:31:59,783
“出售”

593
00:32:11,372 --> 00:32:12,339
喂？
Hello?

594
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:15,338
他快死了
He's going to die.

595
00:32:15,476 --> 00:32:16,443
什么？
What?

596
00:32:16,744 --> 00:32:18,712
他们要叫他出院
They're releasing him.

597
00:32:18,846 --> 00:32:19,335
谁？
Who?

598
00:32:20,014 --> 00:32:23,313
透纳医师刚离开
Dr. Turner just left here...

599
00:32:23,451 --> 00:32:26,477
他们今早请麦克出院
...and they are releasing Mike this morning.

600
00:32:26,654 --> 00:32:29,418
等等，他们不会送他回家的
Baby, wait a minute.

601
00:32:28,055 --> 00:32:29,545
No, they won't send him home.

602
00:32:29,557 --> 00:32:30,717
我昨天才交钱给他们
I gave them money yesterday.

603
00:32:30,858 --> 00:32:32,723
那不重要，约翰，听我说
It doesn't matter, John, listen to me.

604
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,691
他们要他出院
They are releasing him.

605
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:37,457
拜托，我跟医院谈过
Come on, baby, I talked to the hospital.

606
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:38,632
他们说K我会处理的
I'll take care of it.

607
00:32:38,766 --> 00:32:40,631
你老是说你会处理一切
You always take care of everything.

608
00:32:40,701 --> 00:32:41,326
我会的
- I will. - But, it's never enough, is it?

609
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:42,935
但老是处理不好，对吧？

610
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,002
你得想想办法
- Now, you need to do something! - I'll take care of it.

611
00:32:44,138 --> 00:32:45,264
我会处理的

612
00:32:45,406 --> 00:32:47,499
你听清楚了？想办法
Do something!

613
00:33:32,987 --> 00:33:33,919
你复原的很好
You're doing great. You really are.

614
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:36,215
真的，你大概重了五磅吧？
You've gained, what, about five pounds?

615
00:33:37,124 --> 00:33:40,423
我想你是这里唯一吃得下的人
You're the only patient I have who actually eats the food in this place.

616
00:33:41,495 --> 00:33:42,689
医生，请问你
Doc, let me ask you something.

617
00:33:42,863 --> 00:33:44,694
我何时才能打网球？
How long before I'm able to play tennis?

618
00:33:44,865 --> 00:33:46,799
别闹了，干嘛急着打球？
You couldn't play tennis before your new heart.

619
00:33:46,934 --> 00:33:48,925
改打中国结吧？
Why would you want to play now? Take up knitting, okay?

620
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:50,634
我会打网球
- I play tennis. - We don't care, sweetheart.

621
00:33:50,771 --> 00:33:51,897
我们不在乎，甜心
Please get back to work. Thank you so much.

622
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:54,234
回去做事吧，谢谢你

623
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:56,907
海蒂，安排我们下周共进晚餐
Heidi, make an appointment for us to have dinner next week.

624
00:33:57,044 --> 00:33:58,443
我来做菜
- I'm going to cook. - No, you're not going to cook.

625
00:33:58,579 --> 00:33:59,876
不，千万不要
And you're not wearing any lingerie around him for the next month.

626
00:34:00,014 --> 00:34:01,675
你可别穿性感内衣绕着他转

627
00:34:01,816 --> 00:34:03,681
他遗产没你的份，他告诉我的
Because you're not in his will, he told me.

628
00:34:03,818 --> 00:34:05,945
别冒不必要的风险
So, don't push your luck.

629
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:08,813
我昨天交了六千元给医院
I gave the hospital $6000 yesterday.

630
00:34:11,292 --> 00:34:12,589
我能跟你谈谈吗？
- Can I talk to you? - Yes, sure.

631
00:34:12,693 --> 00:34:14,092
好，没问题

632
00:34:15,896 --> 00:34:16,624
很好
Okay.

633
00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:19,732
好好照顾他
- Okay, take care of him. - Thank you.

634
00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:21,164
谢谢你

635
00:34:27,641 --> 00:34:30,610
我太太说你要麦克出院，是吗？
My wife says you're sending Michael home.

636
00:34:30,678 --> 00:34:32,873
亚契先生，我只是医生
Is that true?

637
00:34:30,844 --> 00:34:32,641
Mr. Archibald, I'm a physician.

638
00:34:33,013 --> 00:34:34,605
政策不是我决定的
I don't make policy decisions.

639
00:34:34,682 --> 00:34:36,206
那是由董事会决定
That's handled by the board of trustees.

640
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,840
你是心脏外科主任
You're the head of Cardiac Surgery.

641
00:34:37,985 --> 00:34:40,249
只要你建议，他们会听
You make a recommendation, they'll listen.

642
00:34:40,387 --> 00:34:41,911
我常常作建议
I make recommendations all the time.

643
00:34:42,056 --> 00:34:46,823
但最后决定权在董事会 就这样，把他送回家
The final decision rests with the board, not me.

644
00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:46,993
That's it. Send him home.

645
00:34:47,061 --> 00:34:48,358
恐怕是的
I'm afraid so.

646
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:52,492
我们能一起散个步吗？
Can we take a little walk?

647
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,927
不会太久，我保证
It won't take long, I promise you.

648
00:34:55,102 --> 00:34:56,034
好
Fine.

649
00:34:57,171 --> 00:35:00,106
我昨晚看医院简介
So, I'm looking at the brochure last night.

650
00:35:00,674 --> 00:35:02,471
上面写说
It says that this hospital does over 300 heart surgeries a year.

651
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,737
每年做超过三百件心脏手术

652
00:35:04,879 --> 00:35:06,312
三百件手术
Three-hundred surgeries.

653
00:35:06,447 --> 00:35:08,915
每件收25万，共有多少呢？
Two-hundred fifty thousand dollars a pop.

654
00:35:09,049 --> 00:35:10,243
我算过了
You know how much that is?

655
00:35:10,384 --> 00:35:13,114
心脏手术就值七千五百万
I did the math.

656
00:35:10,684 --> 00:35:13,118
That's 75 million dollars worth of heart surgeries...

657
00:35:13,254 --> 00:35:15,415
而你却不能帮我的忙
...and you can't do one for me in good faith?

658
00:35:15,623 --> 00:35:16,317
一个忙都不帮
John, I waived my fee in your son's case.

659
00:35:16,457 --> 00:35:18,220
约翰，我没收你儿子诊疗费

660
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:19,758
我不是要你免费
I'm not asking you to waive it.

661
00:35:19,894 --> 00:35:21,191
没人要你免费看病
Nobody asked you to waive the fee.

662
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:22,295
我能筹到钱
I can raise the money.

663
00:35:22,463 --> 00:35:25,899
我已筹到两万二，我付钱了
I already came up with $22,000.

664
00:35:26,066 --> 00:35:29,160
我向上帝发誓，我会付钱
I paid you guys.

665
00:35:25,966 --> 00:35:29,299
I swear to God on my life, I'll pay for this.

666
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:30,667
只要给我个机会
Just give me the opportunity.

667
00:35:30,804 --> 00:35:33,238
我工时已被减成20小时了
I'm only getting 20 hours on the job.

668
00:35:33,374 --> 00:35:35,934
我做得到，我能付钱，我发誓
You understand?

669
00:35:33,574 --> 00:35:34,506
I can do this.

670
00:35:36,076 --> 00:35:37,600
我会付钱的
I can pay, I swear to God.

671
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,472
I'll pay you the money back.

672
00:35:37,745 --> 00:35:39,906
我不知怎么付，但我发誓会付
I don't know how, but I promise I will.

673
00:35:40,047 --> 00:35:42,106
你只要相信我
You just got to trust me.

674
00:35:42,249 --> 00:35:44,774
我向你发誓，拜托
I give you my word as a man. Please.

675
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:49,989
请你把手拿开好吗？
Could you take your hands off me, please?

676
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:53,751
我已经尽力了，抱歉
I've done everything I can, I'm sorry.

677
00:35:53,894 --> 00:35:54,826
你没有
- No, you haven't. - Yes.

678
00:35:54,962 --> 00:35:55,929
我有
Let's go inside and talk about it.

679
00:35:56,096 --> 00:35:57,620
我们进去谈吧

680
00:36:03,504 --> 00:36:05,870
我不再求人了，我告诉你
I'm not asking anymore, doctor. I'm telling you.

681
00:36:06,006 --> 00:36:08,941
帮我儿子弄颗新心脏，懂吗？
You are going to give my son a new heart,

682
00:36:09,076 --> 00:36:11,567
是，我明白
you understand me?

683
00:36:09,276 --> 00:36:11,369
Yes. Yes.

684
00:36:13,013 --> 00:36:13,707
好
Okay.

685
00:36:16,417 --> 00:36:17,384
好
Okay.

686
00:36:18,152 --> 00:36:19,141
别动
Don't move.

687
00:36:21,188 --> 00:36:22,780
不准动
Don't move.

688
00:36:31,632 --> 00:36:33,099
你想都别想
Don't even think about it!

689
00:36:34,468 --> 00:36:35,901
把手放下
Put your hands down.

690
00:36:37,204 --> 00:36:38,136
亚契先生
- Mr. Archibald- - - Shut up.

691
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:38,863
闭嘴
I know you're upset.

692
00:36:39,006 --> 00:36:41,600
我知道你不爽，但不能这样
But this is not the way to handle it.

693
00:36:42,443 --> 00:36:43,774
你们不能走这边
Hey, you can't go through this way.

694
00:36:44,645 --> 00:36:46,010
把手举起来
Put your hands up!

695
00:36:46,146 --> 00:36:48,614
举起来、举起来
Put them up! Put them up!

696
00:36:50,084 --> 00:36:51,051
把枪给我
- Give me your gun.

697
00:36:51,185 --> 00:36:51,879
我没有枪
- I don't have a gun.

698
00:36:52,019 --> 00:36:53,509
他们没枪，他们没武装
They don't have guns.

699
00:36:53,654 --> 00:36:55,053
好，好吧
All right, put your hands down, sit down, sit down.

700
00:36:55,189 --> 00:36:57,453
把手放下，坐下

701
00:36:57,658 --> 00:36:58,625
不，站起来
No, no, get up.

702
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:01,353
这会给你儿子带来危险的
You fail to realize the jeopardy that you are putting your son in.

703
00:37:01,495 --> 00:37:02,120
我们得谈谈
- We've got to talk- - - Shut up. Don't move.

704
00:37:02,296 --> 00:37:03,763
闭嘴，别动

705
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,793
好，快住手
Okay, just stop, stop, stop, stop!

706
00:37:06,967 --> 00:37:10,528
好，快住手，你若再继续
Okay, just stop, because if you do this...

707
00:37:10,671 --> 00:37:12,639
你就走上不归路了，你懂吗？
...you're in an irreversible course of action.

708
00:37:12,806 --> 00:37:14,671
踩个刹车想清楚
You understand that?

709
00:37:12,806 --> 00:37:14,433
Put on the brakes and think about this!

710
00:37:14,808 --> 00:37:15,968
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

711
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:17,368
亚契先生，我希望
Mr. Archibald, I hope- -

712
00:37:17,511 --> 00:37:18,443
请你退后
- Back up, please. - What?

713
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:19,271
什么？
- Do as he says. - Please back up?

714
00:37:19,413 --> 00:37:20,107
照他说的去做

715
00:37:20,247 --> 00:37:21,077
请你退后
- What are you doing? - Taking your advice.

716
00:37:21,215 --> 00:37:22,045
你在干嘛？

717
00:37:22,182 --> 00:37:23,843
我接纳了你的建议
I'm not taking no for an answer.

718
00:37:23,984 --> 00:37:25,713
我不再接受任何人的拒绝了
That guy's got a gun!

719
00:37:25,853 --> 00:37:27,013
那个人有枪

720
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,127
你在干嘛？你在干嘛？
What are you doing? What are you doing?

721
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:41,461
退回去，别管闲事
Get back over there!

722
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:41,930
Sit on your hands over there!

723
00:37:42,236 --> 00:37:43,294
过去
Get over there!

724
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,835
透纳、每个人，坐下
Turner, everybody! Get down! Turner, get down!

725
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:46,030
透纳，坐下
Sit on your hands!

726
00:37:46,173 --> 00:37:47,435
坐在自己的手上

727
00:37:47,908 --> 00:37:49,500
把你的手放在屁股下
Put your hands under your butt!

728
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,270
任何人都别动
Don't anybody move!

729
00:37:57,184 --> 00:37:58,378
你在干嘛？
Hey, what are you doing?

730
00:37:59,253 --> 00:38:03,212
我在流血，我是来缝合手指的
I'm bleeding.

731
00:38:00,187 --> 00:38:02,849
Trying to get my goddamn fingers sewn back on.

732
00:38:04,058 --> 00:38:07,050
亚契先生，这些人是无辜的
Mr. Archibald, these people have nothing to do with this.

733
00:38:07,194 --> 00:38:09,890
你得放他们走，他们需要就医
Let them go. They need treatment.

734
00:38:10,064 --> 00:38:13,625
你是医生干嘛不动手？医他吧
This is hospital. You're doctor.

735
00:38:11,632 --> 00:38:13,099
Why don't you treat them? Start with him.

736
00:38:14,768 --> 00:38:16,030
怎么了，医生？
What's the matter, doctor?

737
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:18,801
你要先检查他的保险卡吗？
You want to see his insurance card first?

738
00:38:19,907 --> 00:38:20,874
我来
- I'll do it. - Okay, you do it.

739
00:38:21,442 --> 00:38:22,602
好，你来

740
00:38:23,077 --> 00:38:25,602
等等，我老婆要生孩子了
I got a pregnant wife, here.

741
00:38:25,879 --> 00:38:28,746
好、好、好K
Okay, all right. All right, all right.

742
00:38:28,882 --> 00:38:31,180
听着，等等，大家听着
Listen, wait. Listen, everybody.

743
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:36,783
好，这间医院换新老板了
All right, the hospital's under new management now.

744
00:38:37,091 --> 00:38:38,080
没错
Yeah. From now on, free health care for everybody. How's that?

745
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:42,019
从现在起大家看病免费，怎样？

746
00:38:42,162 --> 00:38:43,288
好耶，老兄
Oh, righteous, man!

747
00:38:43,464 --> 00:38:46,558
别一直用力压啊
Don't squeeze it like you crazy.

748
00:38:46,834 --> 00:38:47,892
你叫什么名字？
- What's your name? - Max.

749
00:38:48,068 --> 00:38:48,557
麦斯
Max, you and Dr. Turner, come with me.

750
00:38:48,669 --> 00:38:50,864
麦斯，你跟透纳医生，跟我来

751
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:53,799
你有那台电梯的钥匙吗？
You got keys for that elevator?

752
00:38:53,941 --> 00:38:56,774
好，我要你关闭电源
Okay. I want you to kill the power.

753
00:39:17,131 --> 00:39:18,792
注意看着他，麦斯
Keep an eye on him, Max.

754
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,659
别乱动，这样我没法子缝
Sit still. I can't do this if you're moving.

755
00:39:21,835 --> 00:39:23,666
你真是青年才俊
You remind me of Doogie Howser.

756
00:39:25,072 --> 00:39:27,063
我们比那个黑鬼早到的
Hey, we were here before the black guy.

757
00:39:27,508 --> 00:39:28,702
每个人都会轮的到
Everybody will get their turn.

758
00:39:28,842 --> 00:39:31,242
我们暂时会留在这里，忍着点
We're not going anywhere for a while, so sit tight.

759
00:39:32,779 --> 00:39:34,679
听着，放轻松点，好吗？
Look, just relax, okay?

760
00:39:44,391 --> 00:39:45,255
喂？
Hello?

761
00:39:46,627 --> 00:39:47,321
喂？
Hello?

762
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,361
喂，是希望纪念医院吗？
Hello, is this Hope Memorial Hospital?

763
00:39:49,663 --> 00:39:51,460
对，这是希望纪念医院急诊室
Yeah, this is Hope Memorial, Emergency Room.

764
00:39:51,632 --> 00:39:54,294
请问该怎么走才能到医院
Could you give me directions?

765
00:39:54,468 --> 00:39:55,059
不行
I need to get there.

766
00:39:55,235 --> 00:39:55,792
什么？
- No. - What?

767
00:39:55,969 --> 00:39:57,095
不行，太太
No, ma'am. We're closed for repairs.

768
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:00,607
我们闭馆维修，你得打到K
You'll have to call- - What do you mean?

769
00:40:00,707 --> 00:40:02,072
什么意思？这很紧急的
This is an emergency!

770
00:40:02,209 --> 00:40:04,143
我知道这很紧急
I understand that it's an emergency, ma'am.

771
00:40:04,545 --> 00:40:06,308
你试过天使医院吗？
Have you tried Mount Angel?

772
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:08,141
我不知道那里怎么去？
I don't know how to get there.

773
00:40:08,282 --> 00:40:10,341
平常都是我老公开车
My husband usually drives.

774
00:40:10,484 --> 00:40:12,349
我需要人告诉我怎么走
I'm going to need some directions.

775
00:40:12,486 --> 00:40:13,612
你从哪里来的？
Which way are you coming from?

776
00:40:14,721 --> 00:40:16,951
好，往佛洛街开去，右转
Ok, Go down Flower, make a right turn.

777
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:19,422
直走到底左转，懂了吗？
Go to the end, make a left. Understand?

778
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,084
你要我怎么办？
What do you want me to do?

779
00:40:21,228 --> 00:40:23,526
小姐，出来
Miss, get out from under there.

780
00:40:26,233 --> 00:40:27,097
你要我在哪生小孩？
Where do you want me to have this baby?

781
00:40:27,234 --> 00:40:29,168
出来，快出来
Come from out of there. Come on out.

782
00:40:32,406 --> 00:40:33,600
去坐在那边
Go sit over there.

783
00:40:35,576 --> 00:40:38,340
真不可思议，这地方真可笑
Unbelievable. This place is a joke.

784
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:39,904
还好我没受伤
Good thing I'm not cut.

785
00:40:40,047 --> 00:40:42,379
不然我就死定了，对吧？
I'd bleed to death in this joint. Right, my man?

786
00:40:43,016 --> 00:40:44,040
抱歉，老兄
Excuse me, brother man.

787
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:48,454
不，你得采取行动，好吗？
No, no, no.

788
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:48,416
You need to do something, Steve, all right?

789
00:40:48,589 --> 00:40:50,784
你得起来，做点什么
You need to get your butt up, and you need to go!

790
00:40:50,924 --> 00:40:52,289
采取行动
- Do something! - Miriam, please sit down?

791
00:40:52,426 --> 00:40:53,256
蜜丽，坐下
- No, I don't want to sit! - What is wrong with you?

792
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,292
我不要坐

793
00:40:54,428 --> 00:40:55,725
你是怎么了？

794
00:40:55,896 --> 00:40:59,491
等等、等等
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

795
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,133
别激动，孩子还没生呢
Relax. Don't have the baby yet.

796
00:41:01,268 --> 00:41:01,734
何时会生？
- What is it due? - Any minute.

797
00:41:01,902 --> 00:41:02,596
随时
Okay, all right. Don't have it.

798
00:41:02,703 --> 00:41:04,295
好吧，还没生

799
00:41:04,471 --> 00:41:05,301
我要生了
- I'm having it. - Not yet. Hang on.

800
00:41:05,439 --> 00:41:06,599
还没，撑着点
Hey, brother.

801
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:07,503
老兄
She's having a baby. Hang on for a second.

802
00:41:07,641 --> 00:41:09,404
她要生了，等一下

803
00:41:09,543 --> 00:41:11,511
抱歉，老兄
Excuse me, brother man.

804
00:41:11,645 --> 00:41:13,613
你等一下，这位女士要生了
Can you hang on?!

805
00:41:13,747 --> 00:41:14,873
她何时能看医生？
The woman's having a baby!

806
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:15,879
坐下
- When is she going to see a doctor? - Sit down!

807
00:41:17,284 --> 00:41:18,046
坐下
- Sit down. - That 's cool, man.

808
00:41:18,185 --> 00:41:18,879
好吧
- Dr. Klein! - I'll be there in a minute.

809
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:20,077
克莱医生

810
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,619
我马上过去
You and me, we got no problems.

811
00:41:21,722 --> 00:41:23,622
你跟我没过节，你懂吧？
You know what I'm saying?

812
00:41:23,757 --> 00:41:28,820
没错，我们没过节，坐好
That's right, we don't have a problem. Just staying in the seat.

813
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:33,632
我听不懂你在说什么
I don't understand what you're saying, ma'am.

814
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:38,800
耳朵？耳朵感染？
The ear? Ear infection?

815
00:41:39,473 --> 00:41:40,838
你能帮她医治吗？
Can you help her?

816
00:41:40,974 --> 00:41:41,633
我？
- Me? - You.

817
00:41:41,775 --> 00:41:42,537
就是你
- I can't. - Why not?

818
00:41:42,676 --> 00:41:43,506
不行

819
00:41:43,677 --> 00:41:44,666
为什么？
I don't know anything. It's my first day.

820
00:41:44,945 --> 00:41:47,505
我什么都不懂，我第一天上班

821
00:41:57,991 --> 00:41:59,686
大家都到另一个房间去
Everybody in the other room.

822
00:42:00,294 --> 00:42:02,785
大家现在就去另一个房间
Everybody in the other room right now.

823
00:42:01,461 --> 00:42:03,088
Everybody in the other room right now!

824
00:42:04,097 --> 00:42:06,258
我们会医好你，我保证
We'll take great care of you.

825
00:42:06,767 --> 00:42:08,291
保持清醒
I promise. Stay focused on me.

826
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:10,258
开门
Open up!

827
00:42:10,937 --> 00:42:12,404
开门，有枪伤病患
Open up. We got a gunshot victim. He's lost a lot of blood.

828
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:13,663
他大量失血

829
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:16,775
去别家医院
Go to another hospital.

830
00:42:17,144 --> 00:42:18,372
快开门
Let's go. Open the door.

831
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:19,841
你认得这些人？
- You now these guys? - Yeah.

832
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,038
认得

833
00:42:21,281 --> 00:42:22,145
你确定？
- You sure? - They're here all the time.

834
00:42:22,282 --> 00:42:23,476
他们常来这里

835
00:42:23,817 --> 00:42:24,681
开门
Open the door.

836
00:42:28,555 --> 00:42:29,419
把你的外套脱掉
- Take your jacket off. - What?

837
00:42:29,556 --> 00:42:30,250
什么？

838
00:42:31,892 --> 00:42:34,190
快点，快脱掉
Open it up. Take it off.

839
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:37,958
把它放地上，走开，把他留下
Just put it on the ground. Walk away. Leave him there.

840
00:42:38,131 --> 00:42:39,928
留下他就对了，快走
Just leave. Go, go. Go!

841
00:42:41,468 --> 00:42:42,492
快走
Just go!

842
00:42:45,672 --> 00:42:46,639
他怎么了？
- What's wrong with him? - He got shot.

843
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:48,633
他中枪了

844
00:42:55,982 --> 00:42:57,006
好，走吧
All right, come on.

845
00:43:08,028 --> 00:43:11,361
等等，这袋子里是什么
Hey, wait, I want to see what's in this bag.

846
00:43:11,531 --> 00:43:12,463
你怎么了？
What happened to you, buddy?

847
00:43:13,433 --> 00:43:16,925
我把收银机里的钱都给了他们
I gave them all the money in the register.

848
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:19,434
但他们还是对我开枪
They shot me anyway.

849
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,072
老天爷
Jesus Christ.

850
00:43:21,441 --> 00:43:23,739
他得立刻手术，送进外伤病房
He needs surgery now.

851
00:43:23,877 --> 00:43:24,400
好
Can I take him to Trauma one?

852
00:43:24,544 --> 00:43:25,408
好的
- Okay. - All right.

853
00:43:26,113 --> 00:43:27,171
情况如何？
- What do we got? - Gunshot wound to the belly.

854
00:43:27,314 --> 00:43:28,406
腹部枪伤

855
00:43:28,782 --> 00:43:29,840
急救人员有做任何处置吗？
- Did we get anything from the EMTs? - No.

856
00:43:29,983 --> 00:43:30,449
没有
Doc Turner, we'll need a hand. Oh, man.

857
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,140
透纳医生，我们需要你帮忙

858
00:43:32,285 --> 00:43:33,252
天啊

859
00:43:35,856 --> 00:43:36,652
帮我一把吧？
Give me a hand?

860
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:39,281
三、二、一，抬起来
Three, two, one, lift.

861
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:40,150
谢谢
Thank you.

862
00:43:42,729 --> 00:43:44,321
我帮不上忙，这是枪伤
No, I can't handle this.

863
00:43:44,498 --> 00:43:46,659
我是心脏外科的，不是急诊科
This is a gut shot. I'm a cardiac surgeon.

864
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:48,824
这跟骑脚踏车一样简单
I'm not an Emergency Room physician.

865
00:43:46,967 --> 00:43:48,059
It's like riding a bike, doc.

866
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:50,333
就假装你有收费吧
Pretend you're getting paid.

867
00:43:50,971 --> 00:43:52,905
这是萍果跟橘子的差别，不行
This is apples and oranges, okay?

868
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:54,370
他快死了，救救他
He's dying. Help me.

869
00:43:54,508 --> 00:43:55,372
我想救他，但我没有K
- I'd like to help him. I haven't done- -

870
00:43:55,509 --> 00:43:56,635
动手吧
- Do it!

871
00:43:59,146 --> 00:44:01,046
注射止痛剂，局部麻醉
Seventy-five milligrams Demerol I. V. Lidocaine, two percent local.

872
00:44:01,181 --> 00:44:02,045
立刻洗手
Scrub right now.

873
00:44:02,182 --> 00:44:03,479
局部麻醉免了，改全身麻醉
Forget the local. I'm putting him to sleep.

874
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:07,381
我出去后要告这家医院跟保全
When I get out of here,

875
00:44:05,819 --> 00:44:07,616
I'm suing this hospital and your security company.

876
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:09,751
你凭什么认为你一定能出去？
What makes you so sure you're getting out of here?

877
00:44:22,769 --> 00:44:23,793
来了
Here we go.

878
00:44:38,418 --> 00:44:39,851
好了，请站到线后
All right, you got to stand behind the line, sir.

879
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:44,051
把这辆车弄出去，谢谢
Move this out of here for me? Thank you.

880
00:44:44,691 --> 00:44:47,285
副队长，麻烦大了
Lieutenant. We got a real problem here.

881
00:44:47,394 --> 00:44:47,917
什么麻烦？
- What's that? - This guy's in for the long haul.

882
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:49,619
这家伙准备长期抗战

883
00:44:49,796 --> 00:44:51,024
他锁住急诊室
He's locked the E. R., barricaded himself in

884
00:44:51,198 --> 00:44:54,258
把自己困在里面，关闭电梯电源

885
00:44:52,866 --> 00:44:54,197
and killed the power in the elevators.

886
00:44:54,434 --> 00:44:57,403
我们若破门而入 他会大开杀戒
If we bust down the door,

887
00:44:55,769 --> 00:44:57,236
this son of a bitch might start killing people.

888
00:44:57,571 --> 00:45:00,005
急诊室里有两架监视摄影机
There's two video cameras hidden in the E. R.

889
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,971
是属于医院监视系统
The hospital's surveillance.

890
00:45:02,108 --> 00:45:03,234
我们正在设法连结视讯
We're setting up a video tap.

891
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:04,377
你负责保全？
You in charge of security?

892
00:45:04,511 --> 00:45:07,605
不，是皮瓦利，他今天休假
No. That's Wally Pitoniak.

893
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:10,147
不再是了，叫他过来
It's his day off.

894
00:45:07,947 --> 00:45:09,244
Not anymore, it ain't.

895
00:45:09,382 --> 00:45:10,679
Get him down here.

896
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,446
能弄条安全的通话线路吗？
Can you get me a secure line?

897
00:45:14,621 --> 00:45:14,985
行
Yes.

898
00:45:15,121 --> 00:45:17,248
副队长，里面的人有无线电
Lieutenant, we got one of our guys on the inside.

899
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:19,654
你也许会想试试
He's got a walkie-talkie.

900
00:45:18,658 --> 00:45:20,091
You might want to try this.

901
00:45:20,327 --> 00:45:22,659
切断急诊室的电话线路
Put a clamp on all pone lines to the E. R.

902
00:45:22,796 --> 00:45:25,264
他若拿起电话，我要他跟我谈
If he picks up the phone, I want him talking to me.

903
00:45:25,398 --> 00:45:26,558
没问题
Done.

904
00:45:27,901 --> 00:45:28,799
谁是这里的负责人？
- Who's in charge here? - Rebecca Payne, sir.

905
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:30,232
潘芮贝

906
00:45:30,504 --> 00:45:31,801
她今天也休假
It's her day off too.

907
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:34,634
天，这医院到底有没有人上班
Does anybody work at this hospital?

908
00:45:34,908 --> 00:45:35,932
今天是周六
It's Saturday, sir.

909
00:45:36,076 --> 00:45:37,065
那又怎样？
So what?

910
00:45:37,744 --> 00:45:39,974
周六也会有人生病，不是吗？
People get sick on Saturday, don't they?

911
00:45:46,653 --> 00:45:47,620
没哭了
No cry.

912
00:45:48,488 --> 00:45:49,614
没哭了
No cry.

913
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:55,159
亚契先生，我要帮她做内诊
Mr. Archibald, I need to do an internal exam on her.

914
00:45:55,395 --> 00:45:56,453
你要带她去哪？
- Where are you going to take here? - Examination room there.

915
00:45:56,696 --> 00:45:57,788
那边的诊疗室

916
00:45:58,031 --> 00:45:59,259
好，去吧
Good. Go.

917
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,136
Oh, my God.

918
00:46:02,736 --> 00:46:03,703
天啊

919
00:46:07,607 --> 00:46:09,370
记住，这不是你的错
Remember, it ain't your fault.

920
00:46:09,509 --> 00:46:10,441
对不起
Excuse me.

921
00:46:11,878 --> 00:46:14,278
我未婚妻的手可能断了
I think my fiancee might have broken her arm.

922
00:46:14,414 --> 00:46:16,609
是不是有人能医治她？
Could somebody take a look at her, please?

923
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:17,910
当然，怎么回事？
Sure, what happened?

924
00:46:18,718 --> 00:46:19,878
有个醉鬼闯红灯
- A drunk ran a red light- - - He slammed into us.

925
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,487
他撞上我们

926
00:46:21,621 --> 00:46:22,053
对吧？
- Right? - Yep.

927
00:46:22,188 --> 00:46:23,120
对
- It was an accident. - Yes, it was.

928
00:46:23,256 --> 00:46:24,120
那是个意外

929
00:46:24,257 --> 00:46:25,224
没错

930
00:46:27,594 --> 00:46:29,027
这是警察
This is the police department.

931
00:46:29,396 --> 00:46:31,694
我要跟负责的人谈
I'm speaking to the man in charge.

932
00:46:31,865 --> 00:46:33,560
请打开无线电
Please pick up the walkie-talkie.

933
00:46:34,668 --> 00:46:36,260
这栋建筑已被团团围住
The building is surrounded.

934
00:46:36,436 --> 00:46:37,596
你们已无法出入
There's no way in or out,

935
00:46:37,671 --> 00:46:40,299
你若听见，我建议你接听
So if you hear me, I advise you to respond.

936
00:46:41,241 --> 00:46:42,299
喂？
Hello?

937
00:46:43,376 --> 00:46:45,071
喂？有人在吗？
Hello? Is anyone there?

938
00:46:46,513 --> 00:46:47,445
有
Yeah.

939
00:46:48,214 --> 00:46:51,377
我是芝加哥警局的葛副队长
This is Lieutenant Frank Grimes of the Chicago Police Department.

940
00:46:51,751 --> 00:46:53,241
你是负责的人？
Are you the man in charge?

941
00:46:55,889 --> 00:46:56,981
没错
That's right.

942
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:58,652
请问你是？
Who am I speaking to?

943
00:47:00,927 --> 00:47:01,985
约翰
John...

944
00:47:03,897 --> 00:47:04,989
老Q
...Q.

945
00:47:06,933 --> 00:47:08,833
好，约翰老Q
All right, John Q.

946
00:47:09,769 --> 00:47:11,896
重覆，我是葛副队长
Again, I'm Lieutenant Grimes,

947
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:13,938
但我要你叫我法兰，可以吗？
But I want you to call me Frank. Can you do that?

948
00:47:14,074 --> 00:47:15,132
好，法兰
Sure, Frank.

949
00:47:15,442 --> 00:47:16,932
我负责人质谈判
I'll be the hostage negotiator.

950
00:47:17,077 --> 00:47:20,069
我当警察35年，我都这么做
I've been a cop for 35 years.

951
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,007
我不玩花样，也不耍人
This is all I do.

952
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,111
I don't play games. I don't fool around.

953
00:47:22,148 --> 00:47:25,242
我说的话，你绝对可以相信
So if I say something, you can take it to the bank.

954
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:26,745
我们来谈谈吧
Now, let's get down to it.

955
00:47:27,621 --> 00:47:28,883
有人受伤吗？
Is anybody hurt?

956
00:47:29,656 --> 00:47:32,147
这是急诊室，大家都受了伤
It's an E. R. Everybody's hurt.

957
00:47:32,959 --> 00:47:33,983
他们很好
They're fine.

958
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:34,783
很好
Good. An long as it stays that way, we can keep talking.

959
00:47:34,928 --> 00:47:37,658
继续这样，我们就能好好谈

960
00:47:37,831 --> 00:47:39,560
你想要什么？
What is it that you want?

961
00:47:39,933 --> 00:47:42,026
你找到潘芮贝
You find Rebecca Payne,

962
00:47:42,202 --> 00:47:44,261
希望纪念医院的行政主管
Hope Memorial's administrative supervisor.

963
00:47:44,437 --> 00:47:45,631
找到她
You find her.

964
00:47:45,772 --> 00:47:49,435
叫她把我孩子放上移植名单
You tell her I want my kid's name on the donor's list.

965
00:47:49,643 --> 00:47:52,305
听清楚了？把我孩子放上名单
My kid's name on the donor's list.

966
00:47:52,646 --> 00:47:53,476
是儿子还是女儿？
- Kid boy or girl? - A boy.

967
00:47:53,647 --> 00:47:54,614
儿子
I got two boys myself, John.

968
00:47:54,948 --> 00:47:56,779
我自己有两个儿子

969
00:47:57,651 --> 00:47:59,312
两个女儿、两个儿子
Two girls and two boys.

970
00:48:01,588 --> 00:48:03,078
别想耍我，法兰，你明白吗？
Don't handle me, Frank. You understand me?

971
00:48:03,223 --> 00:48:05,987
我不喜欢被耍，我没那么笨
I don't want to be handled.

972
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:06,119
It insults my intelligence.

973
00:48:06,126 --> 00:48:09,721
别激动，约翰，千万别激动
Take it easy, John. The idea's not to get too excited.

974
00:48:09,996 --> 00:48:12,089
我想怎样就怎样，你明白吗？
I'm going to take it any way I can get it.

975
00:48:12,265 --> 00:48:13,323
这是我的要求
You understand me?

976
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,524
要是做不到
Now, this is what I want.

977
00:48:14,701 --> 00:48:15,793
你就会害死人
If I don't get it...

978
00:48:15,969 --> 00:48:17,596
听明白了？
...there'll be some dead bodies on your hands.

979
00:48:17,737 --> 00:48:21,935
我听的很清楚，我会写下来
Understand me?

980
00:48:17,837 --> 00:48:19,964
I hear you loud and clear.

981
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:22,207
I'll jot that down. Rebecca Payne. Right?

982
00:48:22,075 --> 00:48:22,905
潘芮贝，对吧？
All right.

983
00:48:23,043 --> 00:48:23,702
对

984
00:48:24,878 --> 00:48:26,971
外面有很多警察，约翰
Now, there're a lot of cops out here, John.

985
00:48:28,615 --> 00:48:30,378
你确定你要这么做？
Sure you want to go through with this?

986
00:48:30,517 --> 00:48:31,745
对，我确定
Yeah, I'm sure.

987
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:34,819
好，等着吧
All right, sit tight.

988
00:48:35,055 --> 00:48:37,387
你的处境很艰困，有很多问题
You're in a tough spot, John.

989
00:48:37,524 --> 00:48:39,287
但你若跟我合作，讲理一点
A lot of trouble.

990
00:48:37,457 --> 00:48:38,389
But if you work with me,

991
00:48:39,426 --> 00:48:41,291
我们总会想出解决的办法
if you're reasonable, we'll figure a way out.

992
00:48:41,428 --> 00:48:44,124
我们必须对彼此有坚定信念
We have to have faith in one another.

993
00:48:44,431 --> 00:48:45,125
为什么？
Why is that, Frank?

994
00:48:45,298 --> 00:48:46,390
为什么？
Why?

995
00:48:47,467 --> 00:48:49,435
信念就是这样
That's what faith's all about.

996
00:48:49,703 --> 00:48:52,137
去相信你不想相信的东西
Believing what you don't want to believe.

997
00:48:52,906 --> 00:48:55,101
不管怎样，你又能怎么办？
Besides, what else are you going to do?

998
00:48:58,144 --> 00:48:59,236
我要做羊膜穿刺
- I want my epidural. - Too late.

999
00:48:59,379 --> 00:49:00,277
太迟了
- She's in pain, doc- - - Out!

1000
00:49:00,413 --> 00:49:01,402
她很痛，医生

1001
00:49:01,548 --> 00:49:02,572
出去
She'll be fine.

1002
00:49:02,716 --> 00:49:04,013
她不会有事的

1003
00:49:14,227 --> 00:49:15,387
第一胎？
First child?

1004
00:49:15,595 --> 00:49:17,256
对，没错
Yeah. Yeah, I'm...

1005
00:49:18,698 --> 00:49:20,393
我有点紧张
I'm kind of nervous.

1006
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,261
是啊，我以前也一样
Yeah, I was too.

1007
00:49:22,869 --> 00:49:24,200
你想要儿子还是女儿？
Do you want a boy or girl?

1008
00:49:24,337 --> 00:49:25,565
都好
It doesn't matter to me, man.

1009
00:49:25,638 --> 00:49:27,469
只要孩子健康就好
As long as my kid's healthy.

1010
00:49:28,341 --> 00:49:29,968
我只求这样
That's all I want.

1011
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:37,381
听着，我说这话没有恶意
Listen, I didn't mean anything by that, man.

1012
00:49:38,251 --> 00:49:40,776
- Just give me some drugs. - Miriam, focus.

1013
00:49:44,424 --> 00:49:45,982
当时谁在开车？
Who was driving?

1014
00:49:46,493 --> 00:49:48,017
车子，谁在开？
The car. Who was driving?

1015
00:49:48,261 --> 00:49:49,353
是我
I was.

1016
00:49:50,363 --> 00:49:51,990
这跟那有什么关系？
What's that got to do with anything?

1017
00:49:52,165 --> 00:49:54,599
为什么她受伤，你却没有？
Why's your girl all banged up and you're not?

1018
00:49:58,004 --> 00:49:59,699
那你认为这是什么？
What do you call this?

1019
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:01,436
你笑什么？
- What are you laughing at? - Somebody get this fool a Band-Aid.

1020
00:50:01,574 --> 00:50:03,906
快帮这家伙拿个OK绷吧

1021
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:06,068
我不希望你失血过多而死
I don't want you to bleed to death.

1022
00:50:07,013 --> 00:50:08,480
去你的，这很痛的
Screw you, man. That shit hurts.

1023
00:50:09,682 --> 00:50:12,515
他的安全气囊弹开，我的却没有
His air bag went off and mine didn't.

1024
00:50:12,986 --> 00:50:13,884
你开那一种车？
- What kind of car? - Mercedes 500.

1025
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:15,044
宾士五百
You drive a Mercedes 500?

1026
00:50:15,188 --> 00:50:17,156
你开宾士五百？

1027
00:50:18,091 --> 00:50:18,989
哪个年份的？
- What year? - Nineteen eighty-six.

1028
00:50:19,125 --> 00:50:20,786
1986年的

1029
00:50:21,327 --> 00:50:22,726
那是经典名车
It's a classic.

1030
00:50:23,196 --> 00:50:26,324
宾士的乘客座在88年以前
Mercedes didn't make passenger-side air bags till 1988.

1031
00:50:26,499 --> 00:50:28,023
并没有装安全气囊

1032
00:50:29,736 --> 00:50:30,828
逮到了
Busted.

1033
00:50:31,171 --> 00:50:31,967
你想说什么，约翰？
- What's your point, John? - What's yours, Mitch?

1034
00:50:32,105 --> 00:50:33,265
你呢，米区？

1035
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,631
重点是你竟敢痛下杀手
Point is you from the slap-a-ho tribe.

1036
00:50:35,775 --> 00:50:37,470
你想甩了这位小姐
You like to beat on the lady, and everybody here knows it.

1037
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:39,805
大家都明白

1038
00:50:44,484 --> 00:50:46,315
我当时喝醉了
I was drunk, all right?

1039
00:50:57,697 --> 00:50:59,096
别在这里抽烟
Don't smoke in here.

1040
00:50:59,332 --> 00:51:02,130
拜托，通融一下 行个方便吧
Come on, man. Give me a break. Work with me here.

1041
00:51:02,535 --> 00:51:04,127
我尽力了
I'm trying my best.

1042
00:51:04,404 --> 00:51:06,463
老Q先生，我能喝点水吗？
Mr. Q, can I get some water?

1043
00:51:06,906 --> 00:51:08,464
我需要上个厕所
And I need to tinkle.

1044
00:51:08,842 --> 00:51:10,776
我饿到胃痛了
Man, I got missed-meal cramps.

1045
00:51:11,144 --> 00:51:13,874
我很饿，弄一桶炸鸡进来吧
I'm hungry.

1046
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:14,109
Let's get a bucket of chicken in here.

1047
00:51:14,013 --> 00:51:15,981
马上就好，好吗？
In a minute, okay?

1048
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:17,082
里面情况如何？
- How's it going in there? - He's going to make it.

1049
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:19,273
他死不了的
Do you have any idea how much blood this guy lost?

1050
00:51:19,419 --> 00:51:21,614
你知道这家伙失了多少血吗？

1051
00:51:21,821 --> 00:51:24,517
真不可思议，他救了这人一命
It's incredible. He saved this man's life.

1052
00:51:38,438 --> 00:51:39,496
那是什么？
What's that?

1053
00:51:39,672 --> 00:51:40,639
来西斯
Lasix.

1054
00:51:40,907 --> 00:51:43,774
能帮他排除多馀水份的利尿剂
It's a diuretic to help get rid of some of the fluid buildup.

1055
00:51:44,077 --> 00:51:47,478
但他会流失钾，所以要补充这个
But it's potassium depleting, so he needs this one to supplement.

1056
00:51:48,114 --> 00:51:49,081
那些呢？
And those?

1057
00:51:49,682 --> 00:51:52,082
度巴明是为了控制血压
Dopamine for his blood pressure.

1058
00:51:52,218 --> 00:51:54,550
毛地黄刺激心脏，这是医肺积水
Dig for his heart. Primacor.

1059
00:51:54,821 --> 00:51:56,652
天啊，真多
Gosh, it seems like so much.

1060
00:51:56,723 --> 00:51:59,317
是啊，这是抗生素
Yeah, it's a lot. This is antibiotic.

1061
00:51:59,459 --> 00:52:00,426
做什么的？
What for?

1062
00:52:00,727 --> 00:52:03,560
这是预防用药，以备万一
Well, it's prophylactic, just in case.

1063
00:52:07,433 --> 00:52:07,899
那些呢？
And those?

1064
00:52:08,067 --> 00:52:11,059
这两个是控制疼痛的
These two, they're for pain.

1065
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:13,999
我很不舒服
I don't feel so good.

1066
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,802
这会让你暂时觉得有点不舒服
This'll make you feel yucky for a few minutes, buddy.

1067
00:52:17,543 --> 00:52:20,637
但我会去拿点小冰块给你吃
But I'm going to get you some of those crunchy ice chips to chew on.

1068
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,475
怎么样？
How's that sound?

1069
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:25,015
对了，麦克
Hey, Mike, by the way,

1070
00:52:25,485 --> 00:52:27,885
刚刚有个人过来看你
there was this guy, he stopped by to see you.

1071
00:52:28,021 --> 00:52:29,488
他说他是你的朋友
Said he was a friend of your.

1072
00:52:30,256 --> 00:52:32,224
我把他带到这里来了
I got him right here.

1073
00:52:32,558 --> 00:52:35,083
我不知道该不该让他进来
I didn't know if I should let him in or not.

1074
00:52:35,228 --> 00:52:36,160
你觉得呢？
- What do you think? - Yeah, he's okay.

1075
00:52:36,296 --> 00:52:37,661
他很好
He's okay.

1076
00:52:37,964 --> 00:52:39,761
他说他想陪你
Said he wanted to hang out with you.

1077
00:52:40,066 --> 00:52:41,192
他很好
He's okay.

1078
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:42,800
真好
That's great.

1079
00:52:43,336 --> 00:52:44,098
好了
Okay.

1080
00:52:44,704 --> 00:52:45,830
谢谢你
Thank you.

1081
00:53:02,622 --> 00:53:04,590
我的宝贝
My baby. Let me hold my baby!

1082
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:07,222
让我抱我的宝贝

1083
00:53:08,061 --> 00:53:10,757
让我抱我的宝贝
Let me hold my baby!

1084
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:11,988
妈K
Mom...

1085
00:53:12,732 --> 00:53:14,393
爸会来吧？
Is Dad coming?

1086
00:53:14,701 --> 00:53:17,169
会，他会来
Yeah. He's coming.

1087
00:53:17,337 --> 00:53:20,898
什么时候？他在哪里？
When? Where is he?

1088
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:23,739
我不知道
I don't know.

1089
00:53:24,377 --> 00:53:25,901
但他会来的
But he's coming.

1090
00:53:36,656 --> 00:53:37,884
你在做什么？
What are you up to?

1091
00:53:38,024 --> 00:53:39,958
别管我，没用的家伙
Never mind me. You're worthless.

1092
00:53:40,226 --> 00:53:43,286
烂保全，你该趁机扳倒他的
Some security guard.

1093
00:53:41,527 --> 00:53:43,518
You should have zapped him when you had the chance.

1094
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:45,056
用什么扳倒他？
Zap him with what?

1095
00:53:45,331 --> 00:53:47,663
何况，我才不要冒险
Besides, I'm not sticking my neck on the line.

1096
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,791
又没钱可以捞
Not for 8.50 an hour, I'm not.

1097
00:53:59,345 --> 00:54:00,676
你疯了？
Are you nuts?

1098
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,206
你到底在干什么？
- What the hell are you doing? - Looking out for number one.

1099
00:54:02,348 --> 00:54:03,679
为自己找出路

1100
00:54:04,751 --> 00:54:07,811
你想活命，就坐好等人来救
Man, you want to stay alive, you sit tight and wait for the cavalry.

1101
00:54:07,954 --> 00:54:10,582
醒醒吧，警方一定会杀进来
Wake up. The cops are coming in shooting.

1102
00:54:10,723 --> 00:54:12,350
他们才不在乎他儿子
They don't care about his kid, and once he realizes that...

1103
00:54:12,492 --> 00:54:13,959
他明白这一点之后K

1104
00:54:15,061 --> 00:54:16,289
我们就玩完了
...we're all history.

1105
00:54:16,696 --> 00:54:19,631
要是他逮到你，你才玩完了
He catches you with that scalpel, then you're the one that's history.

1106
00:54:19,766 --> 00:54:20,289
是吗？
- Really? - Yeah.

1107
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:21,296
没错
He don't look so bad to me.

1108
00:54:21,434 --> 00:54:22,799
我觉得他并不可怕

1109
00:54:23,069 --> 00:54:25,003
氯乙烷，闻起来像豆蔻
Ethyl chloride. Just like mace.

1110
00:54:25,138 --> 00:54:27,971
听着，把那些东西放回去
Put the stuff back before you get us- -

1111
00:54:28,107 --> 00:54:29,904
你才给我听着，猪头警卫
You listen to me, you stupid rent-a-cop.

1112
00:54:30,043 --> 00:54:31,203
我可不是笨蛋
I am not a slob.

1113
00:54:32,011 --> 00:54:35,208
我的人生很棒，很重要
I have a life, and it means something to me.

1114
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:38,416
我才不要死在这里，绝不
I'm not going down in this shithole.

1115
00:54:37,116 --> 00:54:38,310
No, sir.

1116
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:48,955
你好、你们好
How are you? How are you doing?

1117
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:51,588
你好、你好
How are you? How are you?

1118
00:54:52,065 --> 00:54:53,362
各位好
How are you, fellas?

1119
00:54:54,834 --> 00:54:56,301
暴徒是否要求让他儿子动手术？
Is it true the man inside wants an operation for this son?

1120
00:54:56,469 --> 00:54:57,595
你好啊
Hey, how you doing, man?

1121
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:01,433
孟局长，知道他拿什么武器吗
Chief Monroe.

1122
00:54:59,005 --> 00:55:00,996
Do you know what kind of weapon he has?

1123
00:55:01,574 --> 00:55:03,098
我一知道就告诉你，好吗？
I'll let you know when I know, okay?

1124
00:55:03,242 --> 00:55:04,834
你会是第一个知道的
You'll be the first to know.

1125
00:55:04,977 --> 00:55:07,309
我等下就告诉你
I'll let you know later.

1126
00:55:07,447 --> 00:55:08,641
真高兴看到你，葛斯
Good to see you, Gus.

1127
00:55:08,781 --> 00:55:10,180
你好，法兰，真受瞩目啊
- How you doing, Frank? It's hot. - Yeah, it is.

1128
00:55:10,316 --> 00:55:10,839
没错
So?

1129
00:55:10,983 --> 00:55:11,711
怎么回事？
- It's early for the heavy artillery. - Maybe. Maybe not.

1130
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:13,580
太早出动大批警力了吧？

1131
00:55:13,686 --> 00:55:15,654
也许吧，也许不会

1132
00:55:16,322 --> 00:55:17,311
怎么回事？
- What's going on? - You're looking at it.

1133
00:55:17,623 --> 00:55:18,851
你正目睹一切

1134
00:55:19,058 --> 00:55:20,821
里面有个很沮丧的父亲
Very upset father inside,

1135
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,554
我们得给他几分钟冷静下来
so we're giving him a few minutes to cool off.

1136
00:55:27,733 --> 00:55:29,166
别给他太多时间了
Let's not give him too much time.

1137
00:55:29,435 --> 00:55:31,835
尽快解决这件事，好吗？
Let's end this quick and quiet. Okay?

1138
00:55:31,971 --> 00:55:32,960
这正是我们的计划
- That's the plan. - All right, good. Good.

1139
00:55:33,139 --> 00:55:34,606
好，很好

1140
00:55:35,141 --> 00:55:37,632
那样的话，我就在此支援吧
In that case, I'm just here to lend my support.

1141
00:55:37,777 --> 00:55:40,905
我不需要保姆，不会有问题的
I don't need a babysitter, Gus.

1142
00:55:41,047 --> 00:55:41,445
是吗？
It's under control.

1143
00:55:41,647 --> 00:55:42,079
没错
- Is it? - Yes, it is.

1144
00:55:42,215 --> 00:55:42,943
好吧
All right.

1145
00:55:43,483 --> 00:55:46,179
街上不能有人持枪跑来跑去
Can't have people running around the street using guns, Frank.

1146
00:55:46,819 --> 00:55:48,878
那会让人觉得本市很危险
Make it look like the city's unsafe.

1147
00:55:50,089 --> 00:55:51,681
另外，我必须待在这里
Besides, I got to be here.

1148
00:55:52,225 --> 00:55:54,591
我不想让人以为局长在偷懒
Police chief doesn't show up, looks like he's asleep at the wheel.

1149
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:56,456
那就别插手乱管
Well, just stay out of my way.

1150
00:55:56,629 --> 00:55:57,857
电视台的摄影机在那里
The TV cameras are over there.

1151
00:55:58,030 --> 00:56:00,089
那应该会让你觉得很自在
Should make you feel right at home.

1152
00:56:00,266 --> 00:56:01,290
是啊
Right.

1153
00:56:01,601 --> 00:56:02,829
你放轻松点嘛
Why don't you just relax?

1154
00:56:04,837 --> 00:56:06,464
你为何老是无法放轻松？
- Why can't you relax? - I'm fine.

1155
00:56:06,606 --> 00:56:07,197
我很好
Do your job.

1156
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:09,467
做你该做的事，我不会K你
I'm not here to cut your nuts off.

1157
00:56:09,609 --> 00:56:10,337
我是在做啊
- I'm doing my job. - We're both cops, right?

1158
00:56:10,476 --> 00:56:11,443
我们都是警察，对吧？
We're on the same side, remember?

1159
00:56:11,611 --> 00:56:12,635
我们是站在同一边的，记得吧？
Right, right, right.

1160
00:56:12,778 --> 00:56:14,575
对、对

1161
00:56:14,714 --> 00:56:15,646
好
Okay.

1162
00:56:16,315 --> 00:56:18,613
很高兴见到你，谢谢
It's good to see you. Thanks.

1163
00:56:19,051 --> 00:56:21,576
喂？是的，市长先生
Hello? Yes, Mr. Mayor.

1164
00:56:21,687 --> 00:56:22,676
回头见了
I'll see you in a little bit.

1165
00:56:23,289 --> 00:56:25,314
不，我们了解K好，我知道
No, we got it- - Okay. I got it.

1166
00:56:27,693 --> 00:56:28,819
老人家在找成人纸尿布
The old man looking for his Depends.

1167
00:56:28,961 --> 00:56:30,394
他是不是忘在这里了？
Did he lave them over here?

1168
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:44,167
我不懂为何医生们没发现
I don't understand why they never found it, the doctors.

1169
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:48,440
我儿子出生时健康的很
My son has had clean checkups since the day he was born.

1170
00:56:48,714 --> 00:56:50,614
医生为何没发现问题？
How could the doctors not pick it up?

1171
00:56:50,716 --> 00:56:52,843
他也许并未彻底检查
He might not have been tested thoroughly enough.

1172
00:56:52,985 --> 00:56:54,043
为什么？
Why not?

1173
00:56:57,757 --> 00:56:59,622
你加入的是HMO的保险吧？
- You got an HMO, right? - Yeah.

1174
00:56:59,692 --> 00:57:00,181
对
There's your answer.

1175
00:57:00,326 --> 00:57:01,258
答案就在这里

1176
00:57:01,661 --> 00:57:04,892
HMO付钱请医生不要检查
HMOs pay their doctors not to test.

1177
00:57:05,598 --> 00:57:07,293
那样可以压低成本
That's the way. It keeps costs down.

1178
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:10,526
假设麦克需要额外的检验
Say Mike did need additional testing,

1179
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:12,797
但保险公司说他们不会付钱
and insurance says they won't cover it...

1180
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:12,597
...the doctor keeps his mouth shut...

1181
00:57:12,939 --> 00:57:13,769
医生就会闭上嘴
...and come Christmas,

1182
00:57:13,906 --> 00:57:14,804
到了圣诞节
the HMO sends the doctor a fat-ass bonus check.

1183
00:57:14,941 --> 00:57:17,171
HMO就会寄分红支票给医生

1184
00:57:17,443 --> 00:57:18,569
真的吗？
- Is that true? - Possible.

1185
00:57:18,811 --> 00:57:19,869
有可能

1186
00:57:20,513 --> 00:57:22,208
不一定，但有可能
Not likely, but possible.

1187
00:57:22,348 --> 00:57:25,078
这些医生可能早知道有问题
These doctors my have known what was wrong...

1188
00:57:25,218 --> 00:57:27,413
他们本可以早些治疗他的？
...and they could've treated him all along?

1189
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:29,450
谁知道呢？我不知道，约翰
Who knows? I don't know, John.

1190
00:57:30,056 --> 00:57:31,819
我这不是攻击你，医生
Don't take this personal, doc, but you all a bunch of goddamn crooks.

1191
00:57:32,058 --> 00:57:33,685
但医生真是一群骗子

1192
00:57:33,826 --> 00:57:34,952
你别乱说话
You don't know what you're talking about.

1193
00:57:35,094 --> 00:57:37,187
你们发的誓又是怎么回事？
What about that thing that you guys take?

1194
00:57:37,363 --> 00:57:37,954
发誓？
- The thing? - That promise. What do they call it?

1195
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:39,427
誓言啊，你们怎么说？

1196
00:57:39,632 --> 00:57:41,099
医德伦理誓约
The Hippocratic oath.

1197
00:57:41,267 --> 00:57:44,100
比较像是伪君子誓约吧
More like the hypocritical oath.

1198
00:57:44,237 --> 00:57:45,761
那是怎么说的？
How's it go, doc?

1199
00:57:45,938 --> 00:57:47,872
我宣誓要照顾病患
"I'll solemnly swear to take care of the sick, damned near dying...

1200
00:57:48,007 --> 00:57:50,305
尤其是濒死病患
...unless they ain't got major medical."

1201
00:57:50,443 --> 00:57:51,375
除非他们没有保险
- Something like that?

1202
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:52,135
是这样说的吗？
- You got it perfectly. That's it.

1203
00:57:52,278 --> 00:57:53,336
你说的很正确，就是那样
Funny, but it's not far from the truth.

1204
00:57:53,479 --> 00:57:55,674
这很可笑，但这离事实不远了

1205
00:57:55,815 --> 00:57:57,373
这种事常发生
This shit happens all the time.

1206
00:57:57,516 --> 00:57:59,507
急救人员送进急病伤患
Paramedics bring in some accident victim...

1207
00:57:59,652 --> 00:58:01,552
当会计发现他们付不出钱
...and when accounting finds out they can't pay, they send him packing.

1208
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:03,211
就把他们送走

1209
00:58:03,422 --> 00:58:04,719
医院不能拒绝病人
- Hospitals can't turn people away. - Isn't there laws against that?

1210
00:58:04,857 --> 00:58:05,824
没有法律能处罚他们吗？
Yeah, but there's also ways around those laws.

1211
00:58:05,958 --> 00:58:08,222
有，但他们有漏洞可钻

1212
00:58:08,361 --> 00:58:09,953
我们只需要先稳住他们
The only thing we have to do is stabilize them...

1213
00:58:10,096 --> 00:58:12,360
之后，我们就没责任了
...and after that, we're off the hook.

1214
00:58:12,598 --> 00:58:13,223
事情不是这样的
- That's not how it works. - That's exactly how it works.

1215
00:58:13,399 --> 00:58:15,060
事情就是这样

1216
00:58:15,234 --> 00:58:17,702
也许心脏外科不是，但在这里
Maybe not on the fifth floor, but in here...

1217
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:18,768
要是你没钱
...no money, you get a Band-Aid, a foot in the ass,

1218
00:58:18,904 --> 00:58:21,566
会被乱医一通，然后被踢出去

1219
00:58:21,641 --> 00:58:23,199
闭嘴，够了
and you're out the door.

1220
00:58:21,941 --> 00:58:23,499
Shut up.

1221
00:58:23,442 --> 00:58:26,309
我已经听太多抱怨了
I've heard all the bitching I can stand for one day.

1222
00:58:26,612 --> 00:58:29,877
你们若要把我当成吸血鬼，好
If you all want to regard me as some kind

1223
00:58:28,347 --> 00:58:30,076
of blood-sucking vampire, fine.

1224
00:58:30,016 --> 00:58:31,574
很好，我就当坏蛋吧
Great. I'll be the bad guy.

1225
00:58:32,685 --> 00:58:34,744
但是谁拿枪在要胁人的？
But who's holding the fucking gun?

1226
00:58:42,795 --> 00:58:43,659
长官
Sir!

1227
00:58:44,196 --> 00:58:45,163
副队长
Lieutenant!

1228
00:58:48,634 --> 00:58:49,293
喂？
- Hello? - Hello.

1229
00:58:49,468 --> 00:58:50,298
喂
John, this is Frank Grimes.

1230
00:58:50,636 --> 00:58:52,604
约翰，我是葛法兰

1231
00:58:52,772 --> 00:58:53,898
线路被切了
The line is clipped.

1232
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,167
你拿起电话就直通我这里
You pick up the phone, you get me. Okay?

1233
00:58:56,876 --> 00:58:58,434
有什么需要我帮忙的？
Now, what can I do for you?

1234
00:58:58,844 --> 00:59:00,744
名单的事怎么样了？
What's going on with the list?

1235
00:59:00,946 --> 00:59:02,971
我正在设法，但我需要时间
I'm working on it, but I need time.

1236
00:59:03,115 --> 00:59:04,810
我没时间，法兰
Time I don't have, Frank.

1237
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:06,611
谈谈人质吧
- Let's talk about the postages. - What do you want to know?

1238
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:08,549
那就谈吧，你想知道什么？

1239
00:59:08,621 --> 00:59:10,748
里面情况如何？他们好吗？
What's going on in there? How are they?

1240
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:11,954
他们很好
They're fine.

1241
00:59:12,091 --> 00:59:15,151
我们又吃点心又讨论医疗保险
We seating candy bars and discussing HMOs.

1242
00:59:15,294 --> 00:59:16,522
我们在等你
We're waiting for you.

1243
00:59:16,929 --> 00:59:18,726
放一些人出来
- Let some of them go. - For what?

1244
00:59:18,898 --> 00:59:19,728
为什么？
I do for you, you do for me.

1245
00:59:19,899 --> 00:59:22,527
我帮你忙，你也该表现诚意

1246
00:59:22,702 --> 00:59:24,670
这里有很多人很紧张
Show some good faith.

1247
00:59:22,801 --> 00:59:24,769
A lot of nervous people here, John.

1248
00:59:24,804 --> 00:59:26,465
要是你能放几个人
Make everybody breath a lot easier if we saw some happy faces.

1249
00:59:26,605 --> 00:59:28,334
大家会轻松一点

1250
00:59:28,474 --> 00:59:30,908
等你开始帮忙以后再说
I'll do for you when you start doing for me.

1251
00:59:31,043 --> 00:59:33,443
我要我儿子登上名单
I want my kid's name on that list.

1252
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:34,738
别耍我，法兰
I'm not kidding around, Frank.

1253
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:35,847
表现诚意，约翰
- Good faith, John. - Good faith only takes you so far.

1254
00:59:35,981 --> 00:59:37,573
诚意到此为止

1255
00:59:37,717 --> 00:59:40,618
那是什么？他吗？
What's that? Him?

1256
00:59:40,753 --> 00:59:42,220
目前为止你还没有帮上忙
- So far you haven't earned any points.

1257
00:59:42,355 --> 00:59:43,583
抱歉，我要跟你谈谈
- I need to talk to you. - Yeah.

1258
00:59:43,723 --> 00:59:44,246
好
She's six centimeters dilated, and the baby is breech.

1259
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:46,881
她撑开了六公分，胎位不正

1260
00:59:47,026 --> 00:59:50,553
我们得立刻把她送去产科
We have to move her to Maternity immediately.

1261
00:59:50,696 --> 00:59:51,560
约翰
- John. - Hang on, Frank.

1262
00:59:51,664 --> 00:59:52,596
等等，法兰
Right down here.

1263
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:53,560
在这里

1264
00:59:55,468 --> 00:59:56,799
怎么回事？
- What the hell is going on? - Do you know this man?

1265
00:59:56,936 --> 00:59:57,960
认得这个人吗？

1266
01:00:01,273 --> 01:00:04,003
约翰亚契，他儿子在加护病房
His name is John Archibald.

1267
01:00:04,143 --> 01:00:07,112
派人去病房，我要跟母亲谈
He has a son in ICU.

1268
01:00:04,109 --> 01:00:05,041
Put people on the door.

1269
01:00:05,177 --> 01:00:07,145
I need to talk to the mother.

1270
01:00:07,246 --> 01:00:08,076
你在吗，法兰？
Are you there, Frank.

1271
01:00:08,214 --> 01:00:09,806
我在，约翰
I'm here, John. I'm here.

1272
01:00:09,949 --> 01:00:11,075
我改变主意了
I changed my mind.

1273
01:00:12,451 --> 01:00:13,941
我要放一些人质
I'll let some of the hostages go.

1274
01:00:14,086 --> 01:00:15,553
很好，约翰，这样做很对
That's great, John.

1275
01:00:15,688 --> 01:00:17,679
但等我一开始放人
But when I do, the clock starts. You understand?

1276
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:19,586
就开始计时了，明白吗？

1277
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:21,619
现在4点15
It's 4:15.

1278
01:00:21,961 --> 01:00:24,953
你有一小时，到5点15，懂吗
You got one hour.

1279
01:00:23,095 --> 01:00:25,188
You got till 5:15. Understand, Frank.

1280
01:00:25,097 --> 01:00:27,565
要是我儿子到时没登上名单
If my boy's not on that list by 5:15, somebody is going to die.

1281
01:00:27,733 --> 01:00:29,030
就有人会丧命

1282
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:30,135
约翰，别做傻事
- Don't be stupid. - 5:15, Frank!

1283
01:00:30,269 --> 01:00:31,293
5点15，法兰
Five-one-five, something happens for me!

1284
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:35,031
5点15分，快去设法

1285
01:00:35,174 --> 01:00:35,902
我明白了
Got it.

1286
01:00:36,041 --> 01:00:37,508
你是警察，快找验尸官吧
You're a cop. Call the coroner.

1287
01:00:39,678 --> 01:00:41,270
这太糟了，法兰
This is bad, Frank.

1288
01:00:41,747 --> 01:00:43,908
这一定要赶快解决
This has just got to go away.

1289
01:00:46,786 --> 01:00:49,186
好了，蜜丽
All right, Miriam.

1290
01:00:49,455 --> 01:00:50,979
放轻松，不会有事的
Relax, everything's going to be okay. Our baby will be fine.

1291
01:00:51,123 --> 01:00:52,283
我们的宝贝会很好的，别担心
- And Rosa. - Yes?

1292
01:00:52,425 --> 01:00:52,823
还有萝莎

1293
01:00:52,958 --> 01:00:53,356
什么？
Let's go.

1294
01:00:53,492 --> 01:00:54,220
走吧

1295
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,260
亚契先生
Mr. Archibald?

1296
01:00:57,396 --> 01:00:58,886
请让我先生一起走
Please let my husband come with me.

1297
01:00:59,064 --> 01:01:01,726
不，你先出去，我不会有事的
Baby, no, I need you to get out of here.

1298
01:01:01,901 --> 01:01:04,734
我走好了，我无牵无挂
I'll be okay.

1299
01:01:01,767 --> 01:01:04,759
Shit, I'll go. I'm free.

1300
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:05,359
史提，不要
Steve, no.

1301
01:01:05,538 --> 01:01:06,596
你算不算男人啊？
- What kind of man are you? - Screw you, Tyrone.

1302
01:01:06,772 --> 01:01:08,239
去你的，黑金刚

1303
01:01:08,374 --> 01:01:10,899
什么？去我的？黑金刚？
What? Screw me, Tyrone?

1304
01:01:11,043 --> 01:01:12,010
去我的？
Screw me?!

1305
01:01:12,144 --> 01:01:13,634
等等，别激动
Wait a minute, all right? Just relax- -

1306
01:01:18,784 --> 01:01:20,342
干的好，大老粗
That's right, tough guy.

1307
01:01:26,459 --> 01:01:28,017
茱莉，宝贝，快拿枪
Julie, baby, get the gun!

1308
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:31,055
快捡起枪
Rick up that gun!

1309
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:33,955
快射他，朝他的脸开枪
Now, shoot him! Shoot him right in the face, Julie!

1310
01:01:34,266 --> 01:01:36,530
朝他的脸开枪，快拿枪
Shoot him right in the face! Get the gun!

1311
01:01:36,669 --> 01:01:38,296
拿枪啊
Get the gun.

1312
01:01:39,472 --> 01:01:41,497
干嘛，你疯了？
What, are you crazy?!

1313
01:01:41,674 --> 01:01:43,266
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?!

1314
01:01:43,409 --> 01:01:44,842
快住手
Come on, now!

1315
01:01:47,279 --> 01:01:48,644
麦斯，你有手铐吗？
- Max, you got cuffs? - Yeah.

1316
01:01:48,714 --> 01:01:49,442
有
Oh, God!

1317
01:01:50,082 --> 01:01:51,174
天啊

1318
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:56,653
你这个蠢贱货
You stupid bitch!

1319
01:01:57,156 --> 01:01:59,454
那是因为你海扁我
That's for beating the shit out of me!

1320
01:02:02,027 --> 01:02:05,485
那是因为你混蛋透顶
And that's for being an asshole!

1321
01:02:10,336 --> 01:02:11,166
这个呢？
And this?

1322
01:02:11,537 --> 01:02:13,334
这是因为你叫我贱货
This is for calling me a bitch!

1323
01:02:15,808 --> 01:02:17,241
好痛啊
I felt that one.

1324
01:02:18,544 --> 01:02:21,377
我不会再当你的芭比娃娃了
And I'm not going to go your Barbie anymore.

1325
01:02:22,347 --> 01:02:23,974
Goddamn, baby!

1326
01:02:23,916 --> 01:02:25,247
好耶，宝贝
All that ass and muscles to go with it.

1327
01:02:25,384 --> 01:02:26,646
你真是又辣又带劲
I knew damn well you wasn't no blond.

1328
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:30,016
我就知道你不是金发妞

1329
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:39,927
过来
Come here.

1330
01:02:52,344 --> 01:02:54,107
你们俩个，走吧
Let's go, both of you.

1331
01:02:56,682 --> 01:02:57,740
不管怎样
Whatever happens,

1332
01:02:57,883 --> 01:02:59,783
我要你知道一切会很顺利
I want you to know everything's going to be okay.

1333
01:02:59,919 --> 01:03:00,647
懂吗？
- Understand? - Yes.

1334
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:01,617
我懂

1335
01:03:02,721 --> 01:03:03,312
别担心
- Don't worry. - Okay.

1336
01:03:03,455 --> 01:03:04,581
好

1337
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:06,121
别瞎操心
Don't worry about anything.

1338
01:03:06,258 --> 01:03:08,453
我会永远在你身边
I'll always be there for you.

1339
01:03:11,497 --> 01:03:12,464
别开枪
Don't shoot!

1340
01:03:17,336 --> 01:03:20,430
我要释放人质，别开枪
I'm letting some hostages go! Don't shoot!

1341
01:03:22,107 --> 01:03:23,768
好，你们俩个
All right, you two.

1342
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:26,610
走吧，你们俩个
Let's go, both of you.

1343
01:03:26,979 --> 01:03:29,277
谢谢你、谢谢你
Thank you. Thank you.

1344
01:03:31,417 --> 01:03:33,612
好了，萝莎，你也是
All right, all right. Rose, you too.

1345
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,615
好，好好照顾小孩
All right, Take care of the baby.

1346
01:03:36,755 --> 01:03:39,315
持枪暴徒刚刚放了几个人质
The gunman has just freed several hostages...

1347
01:03:39,458 --> 01:03:43,019
他们将会接受专案小组讯问
...who will be debriefed by the crisis team.

1348
01:03:43,162 --> 01:03:46,620
约翰老Q能帮小孩弄到心脏吗？
Will John Q. Get a heart for his little boy?

1349
01:03:46,699 --> 01:03:50,226
时间会证明一切，记者在医院K
Only time will tell.

1350
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:49,927
From Hope Memorial Hospital...

1351
01:03:50,402 --> 01:03:52,632
持枪暴徒掌控急诊室之后
Is it true a gunshot victim was dropped off.

1352
01:03:52,705 --> 01:03:55,139
是否真有枪伤病患被送进去？
After the gunman took over the E. R?

1353
01:03:55,274 --> 01:03:57,469
对，他让他进去的
Yes. He let him inside.

1354
01:03:57,676 --> 01:03:58,973
请说句话，先生
Can you comment, sir?

1355
01:03:59,111 --> 01:04:00,339
那个人伤的很重
The man was critically injured.

1356
01:04:00,479 --> 01:04:02,344
要不是他让他进去，他死定了
If he hadn't let him in, he would've died.

1357
01:04:02,481 --> 01:04:03,812
太太，你还好吧？
Ma'am. Are you all right?

1358
01:04:04,216 --> 01:04:07,014
我很好，我们的孩子快诞生了
Oh, yeah, I feel good. We're having a baby!

1359
01:04:07,152 --> 01:04:09,985
太太，你对持枪暴徒有何看法
Ma'am, do you have any comments about the gunman?

1360
01:04:10,122 --> 01:04:12,249
约翰老Q，很好的人
John Q., very good man.

1361
01:04:12,391 --> 01:04:13,358
持枪暴徒？
- The gunman? - Very good man.

1362
01:04:13,492 --> 01:04:15,460
很好的人

1363
01:04:25,537 --> 01:04:26,333
里面有摄影机
They got a camera in there.

1364
01:04:26,472 --> 01:04:28,167
他们在看拍到的画面
They're watching a video feed.

1365
01:04:28,307 --> 01:04:28,932
你怎么知道？
- How do you know that? - They're looking at something, Freddy.

1366
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:31,338
他们在看东西

1367
01:04:31,477 --> 01:04:32,307
能弄到吗？
- Can you get it? - Boss, if they got it, I can get it.

1368
01:04:32,444 --> 01:04:34,969
老大，他们有的我都弄得到

1369
01:04:35,314 --> 01:04:38,215
你让步，暴徒会充斥全国医院
You give in, there'll be guns in every hospital in the country.

1370
01:04:38,517 --> 01:04:41,315
又不是只有他家小孩生病
Do you think Mr. Archibald's the only one who has a sick child?

1371
01:04:41,453 --> 01:04:44,149
去爱滋病房看，整层楼都是
Ever checked out the HIV ward?

1372
01:04:44,657 --> 01:04:47,626
人会生老病死，人生就是如此
There's a whole floor of them.

1373
01:04:44,857 --> 01:04:47,792
People get sick, they die, that's the way it goes.

1374
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,990
我每天都面临这样的决策
I face decisions like this every day.

1375
01:04:50,129 --> 01:04:52,689
有人威胁要杀死无辜的人们
A man's threatening to kill innocent people.

1376
01:04:52,865 --> 01:04:54,765
就因为你不帮助他儿子
Because you didn't help his son.

1377
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:59,098
拜托，这国家有五千万人
There are 50 million people in this country.

1378
01:04:57,569 --> 01:04:59,366
Without medical insurance.

1379
01:04:59,371 --> 01:05:00,531
没有医疗保险
If you'd like to change it, you should call your congressman.

1380
01:05:00,673 --> 01:05:02,004
想改变这情况，去找国会议员
Excuse me.

1381
01:05:02,141 --> 01:05:02,971
抱歉

1382
01:05:03,642 --> 01:05:06,167
何不告诉他，他儿子在名单上
Why don't we just tell him his son's name's on the list?

1383
01:05:06,311 --> 01:05:07,801
那不是很好吗？
I mean, doesn't that make sense?

1384
01:05:09,014 --> 01:05:10,606
他反正也不会知道真相
How's he going to know, anyway?

1385
01:05:13,052 --> 01:05:16,488
长官，抱歉，请你过来看看
Sir? Pardon me, can you come take a look at this?

1386
01:05:20,659 --> 01:05:22,923
这是皮华利，保安主管
Sarge, Chief, this is Wally Pitoniak, head of security.

1387
01:05:23,062 --> 01:05:23,551
你好
- How are you? - Nice to meet you.

1388
01:05:23,696 --> 01:05:24,287
幸会
I got your spot.

1389
01:05:24,463 --> 01:05:25,930
我帮你找到狙击点

1390
01:05:26,465 --> 01:05:27,625
你们在这里
Here's your site.

1391
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,631
那里就是最好的点
That's going to be your perch.

1392
01:05:32,104 --> 01:05:33,230
X代表你的电话
The X is your phone.

1393
01:05:34,406 --> 01:05:35,236
哪只电话？
- Which phone? - Bring it up, Jeff.

1394
01:05:35,374 --> 01:05:36,306
靠近一点

1395
01:05:39,745 --> 01:05:41,337
那里那只电话
That phone right there.

1396
01:05:44,249 --> 01:05:45,079
是的，汤姆
It is, Tom.

1397
01:05:45,217 --> 01:05:48,084
孟局长仍说会采取必要行动
But Chief Monroe maintains that police will do what's necessary.

1398
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:51,712
以确保人质的生命与安全
...to preserve the lives and safety of these hostages.

1399
01:05:52,124 --> 01:05:53,113
这个国家
This country, man.

1400
01:05:53,258 --> 01:05:55,021
不管去到哪里
Can't go anymore.

1401
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:58,687
都会被抢、被杀或是被刺
Without getting mugged, or murdered, or stabbed.

1402
01:05:58,864 --> 01:06:01,128
小孩子枪杀同学
Kids killing their classmates, drive-by...

1403
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:03,666
我甚至不敢再去邮局了
I won't even go into a post office anymore.

1404
01:06:03,802 --> 01:06:05,099
闭嘴，米区
- Shut up, Mitch! - You shut up!

1405
01:06:05,237 --> 01:06:06,204
你才闭嘴
I hate the bastard, but he's right.

1406
01:06:06,505 --> 01:06:08,200
我恨那个混蛋，但他说的对

1407
01:06:08,607 --> 01:06:09,699
知道要弄到枪有多容易吗？
You know how easy it is to get a gun?

1408
01:06:09,842 --> 01:06:11,776
五分钟，在枪展上
Five minutes, gun show...

1409
01:06:12,311 --> 01:06:14,142
我明白你孩子病了
I understand that your kid is sick, John.

1410
01:06:14,279 --> 01:06:16,804
但这算什么，我也有人生啊
But what makes him better than me?

1411
01:06:17,049 --> 01:06:18,380
对，但你有保险
I get a life too.

1412
01:06:18,517 --> 01:06:22,009
所以你要开枪？你跟警察说的
Yeah, but you got insurance.

1413
01:06:18,684 --> 01:06:20,276
So you're going to shoot me?

1414
01:06:20,419 --> 01:06:22,114
That's what you're telling the cops.

1415
01:06:22,154 --> 01:06:24,645
要是你儿子没得到心脏
If your son doesn't the very first heart available.

1416
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:25,916
我们就死定了
We all die.

1417
01:06:27,793 --> 01:06:29,784
结局会怎样？
How's it going to end, John?

1418
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:31,256
你打算怎么办？
What's your move?

1419
01:06:32,164 --> 01:06:35,395
我不打算怎样，我不知道
I got no move, okay?

1420
01:06:34,399 --> 01:06:35,491
I don't know what I'm going to do.

1421
01:06:38,737 --> 01:06:41,035
我在等待奇迹，好吗？
I'm waiting on a miracle, okay?

1422
01:06:42,241 --> 01:06:44,471
我在等待上帝的旨意
I'm waiting on an act of God.

1423
01:07:09,868 --> 01:07:11,597
亚契太太？
Mrs. Archibald?

1424
01:07:12,504 --> 01:07:14,563
我们可以谈谈吗？
Could we have a word with you, please?

1425
01:07:17,609 --> 01:07:19,099
这都是我的错
This is all my fault.

1426
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:21,474
医院告诉我要麦克出院时
When the hospital told me they were releasing Mikey...

1427
01:07:21,613 --> 01:07:23,581
我打给约翰，对他乱吼
...I called John and I yelled at him.

1428
01:07:23,649 --> 01:07:25,879
还叫他要采取行动
And told him to do something, anything.

1429
01:07:26,018 --> 01:07:28,612
但我没想到K
But, I never thought...

1430
01:07:28,754 --> 01:07:29,880
我明白
I understand.

1431
01:07:30,022 --> 01:07:32,252
他有暴力倾向吗？
Is he a violent man, Mrs. Archibald?

1432
01:07:32,491 --> 01:07:37,292
没有，他温柔又亲切
No, no, he's sweet and gentle.

1433
01:07:37,796 --> 01:07:39,024
他连小虫都不敢打
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

1434
01:07:39,198 --> 01:07:42,133
他可不这么说，他说要杀人
That's not what he's saying.

1435
01:07:40,499 --> 01:07:42,194
He's talking about killing people.

1436
01:07:42,401 --> 01:07:44,801
我想知道的是K我可能多心了
Now, what I want to know is - I may be fishing here...

1437
01:07:44,937 --> 01:07:49,169
他是否在部队待过或什么的？
...but has he spent any time in the military or anything like that?

1438
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:52,106
这是在干嘛？
- What is this? - What?

1439
01:07:52,244 --> 01:07:53,268
什么？

1440
01:07:54,346 --> 01:07:56,246
我知道了
I see what's going on here.

1441
01:07:58,050 --> 01:08:00,245
你想从我口中套话
You want me to say something.

1442
01:08:00,385 --> 01:08:01,977
好让你拿来对付我丈夫
That you can use against my husband.

1443
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,417
他的麻烦大了
He's in a lot of trouble.

1444
01:08:03,488 --> 01:08:05,547
我们需要你去跟他谈谈
And we're going to need you to talk to him.

1445
01:08:05,624 --> 01:08:07,785
我们把话说明白点吧
Let's get something straight, mister.

1446
01:08:08,193 --> 01:08:11,651
你不能利用我去对付我丈夫
You cannot use me to build a case against my husband.

1447
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:14,230
我支持他所做的每一件事
I support him in everything that he does.

1448
01:08:14,366 --> 01:08:16,425
我站在他那边，不是你这边
I'm on his side, not yours.

1449
01:08:16,602 --> 01:08:17,193
亚契太太
- Mrs. Archibald. - And you don't talk to me!

1450
01:08:17,369 --> 01:08:19,098
你别跟我说话

1451
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:24,901
我可以说出我对你的看法
I would tell you what I think of you...

1452
01:08:26,011 --> 01:08:28,206
但我是虔诚的教徒
...but I'm a Christian woman.

1453
01:08:30,182 --> 01:08:31,444
请你们俩个离开
Now, you two leave me alone. I have a sick child to look after.

1454
01:08:31,617 --> 01:08:33,642
我还要照顾我生病的孩子

1455
01:08:38,223 --> 01:08:41,249
我已决定把麦克列入名单
I've decided to put Michael on the recipient list.

1456
01:08:43,028 --> 01:08:45,462
医院会负担所有费用
The hospital will pay for everything.

1457
01:08:47,432 --> 01:08:49,059
真的？
Really?

1458
01:08:49,334 --> 01:08:50,596
真的
Really.

1459
01:08:52,104 --> 01:08:53,594
谢谢你
Thank you.

1460
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,372
天啊，谢谢你
Oh, God, thank you!

1461
01:09:04,650 --> 01:09:05,844
你真行
You're good.

1462
01:09:05,984 --> 01:09:08,145
什么？

1463
01:09:08,387 --> 01:09:09,718
表演的真棒
- Excuse me? - Quite the performance.

1464
01:09:10,022 --> 01:09:12,547
温暖的拥抱，诚挚的表情
The comforting embrace, the sincere look.

1465
01:09:12,658 --> 01:09:15,525
那一刹那，我真的相信你了
For a minute, I actually believed that you cared.

1466
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:30,567
记者塔克在希望纪念医院
We go now to Hope Memorial Hospital live.

1467
01:09:30,676 --> 01:09:32,234
为您现场报导
Tuck Lampley.

1468
01:09:32,511 --> 01:09:35,378
在医院前的群众越聚越多
The crowd in front of Hope Memorial is growing.

1469
01:09:35,514 --> 01:09:38,005
特勤小组已经到达现场
The SWAT team has arrived.

1470
01:09:38,150 --> 01:09:39,208
现场情况变得相当紧张
And the situation is becoming very tense.

1471
01:09:39,351 --> 01:09:41,216
站在我身旁的是帕吉米
Standing next to me is James Palumbo.

1472
01:09:41,353 --> 01:09:42,786
约翰亚契的朋友
Friend of John Archibald.

1473
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:45,917
帕先生，谈谈亚契先生吧
Mr. Palumbo, what can you tell us about John Archibald?

1474
01:09:46,825 --> 01:09:48,122
你知道K
You know...

1475
01:09:49,361 --> 01:09:52,125
我必须诚实，塔克
...I got to be honest, Tuck.

1476
01:09:52,698 --> 01:09:55,929
这整件事真是可怕
*This whole thing sucks, you know?

1477
01:09:56,835 --> 01:10:00,293
其实这都是可以避免的
*lt all could've been avoided so incredibly easy.

1478
01:10:00,973 --> 01:10:04,409
要是约翰是富翁就不会这样
None of this had to happen if John had been a millionaire.

1479
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:08,035
他是石油大亨就好 但他不了解
Or, if his name was Rockefeller, but sometimes John don't get it.

1480
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:12,116
这国家尊重的不是价值
He don't understand that.

1481
01:10:09,447 --> 01:10:12,348
What we hold sacred in this country isn't values.

1482
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,377
重要的是价钱
It's value that's important.

1483
01:10:14,519 --> 01:10:16,510
我们有富人也有穷人
We got haves, we got have-nots.

1484
01:10:16,655 --> 01:10:19,749
有白领、蓝领阶级，有失业的
We got white-collar, blue-collar, and then we got no-collar.

1485
01:10:20,025 --> 01:10:21,458
所以医院
Inside there.

1486
01:10:21,593 --> 01:10:24,562
有豪华手术也有阳春手术
We got surgery, we got outpatient surgery...

1487
01:10:24,696 --> 01:10:27,290
还有烂手术
...and we got out-of-luck surgery.

1488
01:10:27,466 --> 01:10:28,865
这社会有很多人
There's a lot of people out there, Tuck.

1489
01:10:29,001 --> 01:10:31,595
很多根本没有25万的人
A lot of people here who don't got 250 grand.

1490
01:10:32,004 --> 01:10:35,462
把这样的人逼到绝境真是可耻
To shame a man like that and back him into a corner...

1491
01:10:35,941 --> 01:10:37,238
在我看来
...seems to me.

1492
01:10:37,676 --> 01:10:39,871
这是社会制度失序
Something is out of whack not someone.

1493
01:10:40,012 --> 01:10:42,981
我懂什么？我只是个工人
What do I know? I'm a factory worker.

1494
01:10:43,648 --> 01:10:45,445
看得出来这事令你很难过
I can see this is making you very upset...

1495
01:10:45,584 --> 01:10:47,814
但你若能面对镜头对约翰说话
...but, if you could speak to John Q. Right now.

1496
01:10:47,953 --> 01:10:49,181
你要说什么？
What would you say?

1497
01:10:49,321 --> 01:10:50,879
“帕吉米，约翰的友人”

1498
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:53,620
我与你同在，你要保重
I'm there with you, and you take care.

1499
01:10:54,393 --> 01:10:56,361
这是一个朋友的心声
That's one man's opinion.

1500
01:10:56,495 --> 01:10:59,828
这是记者塔克的报导
Live at the crisis at Hope Memorial, this is Tuck Lampley.

1501
01:11:31,129 --> 01:11:32,357
怎么回事？
What's going on?

1502
01:11:32,531 --> 01:11:33,088
副队长
Were is everybody?

1503
01:11:33,265 --> 01:11:33,924
人呢？
We're sending a guy in through the air duct.

1504
01:11:34,099 --> 01:11:36,431
我们要派人从通风管进去

1505
01:11:37,402 --> 01:11:39,893
要是能让目标到这电话旁
If we can get the target to this phone, we got a clear shot.

1506
01:11:40,072 --> 01:11:41,039
我们就能动手射杀他
- Is that right? - Yes, lieutenant, that is right.

1507
01:11:41,206 --> 01:11:42,002
是吗？

1508
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:44,404
是的，副队长，没错

1509
01:11:44,876 --> 01:11:45,934
When you're ready, chief.

1510
01:11:51,716 --> 01:11:54,241
就等你下令了，局长
Don't be nervous, guys.

1511
01:11:54,386 --> 01:11:56,547
别紧张，各位

1512
01:11:58,356 --> 01:11:59,823
老孟
Monroe!

1513
01:12:01,726 --> 01:12:02,954
我老婆要开骂了
My wife's calling.

1514
01:12:03,095 --> 01:12:04,756
更糟，是老爸要训话了
Worse, chief, it's Father Time.

1515
01:12:05,197 --> 01:12:06,664
你给我过来
Come over here!

1516
01:12:07,466 --> 01:12:10,094
别说了，法兰，我不想听
Not one word, Frank.

1517
01:12:10,268 --> 01:12:12,293
你这混蛋，在我背后搞小动作
Not one word, I don't want to hear- -

1518
01:12:10,368 --> 01:12:11,232
You son of bitch!

1519
01:12:12,471 --> 01:12:14,701
你要我怎么办？你看看时间
You're going behind my back!

1520
01:12:12,671 --> 01:12:14,070
What do you want from me, Frank?

1521
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,068
看看你的表
Look at the clock! Look at your watch!

1522
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:19,234
那家伙说一刻钟后就要开杀戒
The guy said at a quarter after, he's going o start killing peple- -

1523
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:21,106
这太愚蠢了
- This is so goddamn stupid! - Then, what's your great idea?!

1524
01:12:21,246 --> 01:12:22,645
是吗？那你有什么好主意？

1525
01:12:22,781 --> 01:12:26,182
没什么好主意，特别是这个
There are no great ideas, especially this!

1526
01:12:26,318 --> 01:12:29,515
我有机会逮这家伙，我要动手
I got a shot at this guy, and I'm going to take it!

1527
01:12:29,654 --> 01:12:32,122
你做事老是不明快，你在说什么
You always take the open shot!

1528
01:12:32,257 --> 01:12:35,249
他老婆同意要跟他谈，让她来
What are you talking about?!

1529
01:12:32,524 --> 01:12:33,821
The wife has agreed to speak to him!

1530
01:12:33,892 --> 01:12:35,484
Let her talk him down.

1531
01:12:35,393 --> 01:12:37,088
我正打算这么做
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

1532
01:12:37,796 --> 01:12:39,229
利用他老婆逮他？
- Use the man's wife to set him up? - I'll use whatever work, Frnak.

1533
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:42,696
什么有用我就用什么

1534
01:12:41,299 --> 01:12:42,197
Let me paint a picture for you.

1535
01:12:42,834 --> 01:12:44,199
我帮你描绘一下吧
Ok, what we have here is a lose/lose.

1536
01:12:44,336 --> 01:12:46,304
这是一个双输的局面
If he starts whacking hostages, it's bad!

1537
01:12:46,471 --> 01:12:48,234
要是他开始杀人质，就糟了
And if we give in to this asshole it's also bad!

1538
01:12:48,373 --> 01:12:49,863
但我们若向他投降，也很糟

1539
01:12:50,008 --> 01:12:50,804
对谁很糟？
Bad for who?

1540
01:12:50,942 --> 01:12:54,469
对大家都很糟，你、我、大家
It's bad for everybody! Me, you, everybody!

1541
01:12:54,679 --> 01:12:56,271
今年是选举年，就是很糟
It's an election year, it's just bad!

1542
01:12:56,414 --> 01:12:58,439
不管怎样，这家伙不能成功
However it goes down, Frank, this guy's not going to make it!

1543
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:00,710
你要杀他？为选举铺路？
So you kill him?

1544
01:13:00,852 --> 01:13:02,717
死一个坏蛋没什么
That's a P.R. Bonanza, right?!

1545
01:13:00,985 --> 01:13:02,213
I can live with one dead bad guy!

1546
01:13:02,854 --> 01:13:04,378
我忍受不了的是
What I can't live with.

1547
01:13:04,523 --> 01:13:06,013
有无辜的市民受伤
Is one innocent person being hurt!

1548
01:13:06,158 --> 01:13:07,887
不能在我任内
Not one! Not on my watch!

1549
01:13:09,661 --> 01:13:11,424
法兰，你出局了
You know what, Frank? You're out!

1550
01:13:11,596 --> 01:13:12,585
我出局了？
I'm out?!

1551
01:13:12,697 --> 01:13:15,359
与个人无关，但你被停职了
No hard feelings, but you're relieved of duty.

1552
01:13:15,534 --> 01:13:16,762
从现在起由我主导
I'll handle this now.

1553
01:13:16,935 --> 01:13:17,765
你？
- You? - Yeah, me.

1554
01:13:17,903 --> 01:13:18,870
对，我
Think it's my first time in the dance floor?

1555
01:13:19,004 --> 01:13:20,665
你以为我这是第一次指挥？

1556
01:13:20,805 --> 01:13:22,796
你以为我是怎么得到这些的？
How do you think I got these?

1557
01:13:22,941 --> 01:13:24,306
小心点，别惹我
And watch it! Just watch it!

1558
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:27,468
我承受很多压力，很多人在看
I got a lot of pressure on me, Frank. A lot of eye's watching.

1559
01:13:27,646 --> 01:13:30,638
总要有人行动，而你不行动
Someone's got to make the call.

1560
01:13:29,047 --> 01:13:30,810
You're not going to do it!

1561
01:13:30,782 --> 01:13:32,044
那就由我来
I'll do it.

1562
01:13:32,951 --> 01:13:35,419
那些人质怎么办？
What about the hostages, the human beings?!

1563
01:13:35,554 --> 01:13:37,351
他们最好小心点
Better keep their heads down.

1564
01:13:49,801 --> 01:13:50,631
太好了
Great.

1565

The press hacked our signal.

1710
01:22:08,433 --> 01:22:10,901
这成了全国新闻联播画面
This just went out live over national television.

1711
01:22:33,091 --> 01:22:34,581
麦克活不了了
- Mikey's not going to make it. - What about the list?

1712
01:22:34,959 --> 01:22:36,153
他不是上名单了？
What list? They're shooting at me.

1713
01:22:36,294 --> 01:22:37,420
什么名单？他们向我开枪
They're shooting us.

1714
01:22:37,628 --> 01:22:38,788
向我们开枪

1715
01:22:39,163 --> 01:22:40,255
他们不会救我儿子的
They're not going to help my son.

1716
01:22:40,431 --> 01:22:43,423
显然，狙击手潜进医院K
Apparently, the sniper gained access to the hospital through the-

1717
01:22:44,235 --> 01:22:45,167
你要逮捕我？
- You're going to bust me? - You're out of here.

1718
01:22:45,303 --> 01:22:46,099
出去
Get real.

1719
01:22:46,237 --> 01:22:49,172
注意点，你们刚在电视上杀人
You just shot an innocent man on prime-time TV.

1720
01:23:14,232 --> 01:23:15,790
姓葛的呢？
Where's Grimes?

1721
01:23:16,134 --> 01:23:17,328
我要见葛法兰
I want to see Frank Grimes. Hang in there, man.

1722
01:23:17,502 --> 01:23:18,594
等等

1723
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:21,602
葛副队长呢？
Where's Lieutenant Grimes?!

1724
01:23:22,507 --> 01:23:23,405
好吧
All right.

1725
01:23:24,542 --> 01:23:25,509
好什么？
- All right, what?

1726
01:23:25,643 --> 01:23:27,167
去看看他要什么
- Let's see what he wants.

1727
01:23:27,678 --> 01:23:28,406
你在说笑
You're got to be kidding.

1728
01:23:28,546 --> 01:23:31,140
别为难我了，我搞砸了
Don't start breaking my balls. I screwed up.

1729
01:23:31,449 --> 01:23:32,711
我需要你帮忙
I need you to say my ass.

1730
01:23:32,850 --> 01:23:34,750
我搞砸了，求求你，法兰
I stepped in shit. Lease, Frank.

1731
01:23:35,353 --> 01:23:37,878
拜托，我请你吃牛排吧
Come on. I'll buy you a steak.

1732
01:23:39,924 --> 01:23:41,255
北京烤鸭
Peking duck.

1733
01:23:41,392 --> 01:23:42,757
好，没问题
- You got it. - Let's go.

1734
01:23:42,894 --> 01:23:43,758
走吧
A-R-C-H-l-B-A-L-D.

1735
01:23:44,028 --> 01:23:46,997
亚洲的亚，契约的契

1736
01:23:47,865 --> 01:23:50,060
我现在就把资料传给你
I'm faxing you all the stuff right now.

1737
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:01,640
好，来吧，快把这事解决
Okay, come on in. Let's clear this up.

1738
01:24:03,414 --> 01:24:04,438
别开火
Hold your fire!

1739
01:24:04,949 --> 01:24:06,974
别开火，把枪放下，放下
Don't fire. Turn them down. Turn them down.

1740
01:24:07,118 --> 01:24:10,212
这里有很多摄影机，别做傻事
There's a lot of cameras.

1741
01:24:08,285 --> 01:24:10,014
I don't want anybody doing anything.

1742
01:24:11,322 --> 01:24:12,584
跟你来的是谁？
Who's that with you?

1743
01:24:13,591 --> 01:24:15,024
穆警官
Sergeant Moody.

1744
01:24:15,159 --> 01:24:19,220
警察局的孟局长
Police Chief Monroe.

1745
01:24:19,764 --> 01:24:21,891
这是怎么回事，约翰？
What's going on here, John?

1746
01:24:25,136 --> 01:24:26,603
他没穿裤子
He's got no pants on.

1747
01:24:34,846 --> 01:24:36,040
你骗我，副队长
You lied to me, lieutenant.

1748
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:39,149
你说你会给我回报，但你没有
You said you'd call back, Frank, but you didn't call.

1749
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:40,614
我放了人质给你
I give you your hostages.

1750
01:24:40,751 --> 01:24:42,480
但你却没给我回报
But you didn't call me back. Why?

1751
01:24:42,987 --> 01:24:44,386
因为你要我死
Because you want me dead.

1752
01:24:44,522 --> 01:24:46,149
没有人想要你死，约翰
Nobody wants to kill you, John.

1753
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:47,917
没有人想要我死？
Nobody wants to kill me? No.

1754
01:24:48,059 --> 01:24:48,320
没有
- Nobody? - No.

1755
01:24:48,459 --> 01:24:48,891
没有？
- None if these guys? Not him? - No.

1756
01:24:49,026 --> 01:24:49,458
没有

1757
01:24:49,627 --> 01:24:51,458
这些人也不想？他也不想？

1758
01:24:51,629 --> 01:24:52,152
不想
Okay, what is this?

1759
01:24:52,296 --> 01:24:54,059
好，那这是什么

1760
01:24:54,232 --> 01:24:55,290
这是什么？
What is this?

1761
01:25:00,838 --> 01:25:02,430
你以为情况会变成怎样？
What did you think would happen?

1762
01:25:02,773 --> 01:25:05,571
你想知道实情？这就是实情
You want truth? Here's some truth.

1763
01:25:05,710 --> 01:25:07,575
事情终将会对你不利的
This is going to end bad for you, John.

1764
01:25:07,678 --> 01:25:09,270
你只有两条出路
There's only two ways out of here.

1765
01:25:09,914 --> 01:25:11,575
去坐牢
Jail...

1766
01:25:11,916 --> 01:25:13,076
或是没命
...or dead.

1767
01:25:13,618 --> 01:25:15,347
我儿子病的很重
My son is very sick.

1768
01:25:16,621 --> 01:25:18,316
他需要人帮忙
And he needs some help.

1769
01:25:18,623 --> 01:25:19,647
我明白
I understand.

1770
01:25:19,891 --> 01:25:21,722
这年头做人很难
It's hard to be a man these days.

1771
01:25:21,859 --> 01:25:23,190
很难知道该怎么做才对
Hard to know what the right thing is.

1772
01:25:23,327 --> 01:25:24,555
但请你放下枪
But put the gun, John.

1773
01:25:24,695 --> 01:25:28,631
你没听我说，我儿子病了
You're not hearing me, Frank!

1774
01:25:27,031 --> 01:25:28,658
My son is sick!

1775
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:31,300
就这样，没别的了
That's it! There's nothing else!

1776
01:25:31,435 --> 01:25:32,561
结束
End of story!

1777
01:25:34,138 --> 01:25:37,073
人们生病，就需要帮忙
When people are sick, they deserve a little help.

1778
01:25:37,308 --> 01:25:38,002
好耶
Yeah!

1779
01:25:38,142 --> 01:25:40,110
生病、帮忙
Sick, Help!

1780
01:25:40,878 --> 01:25:43,142
生病、帮忙
Sick, Help!

1781
01:25:44,982 --> 01:25:48,679
我不打算帮我儿子送葬
I am not going to bury my son!

1782
01:25:49,353 --> 01:25:51,947
我儿子才会帮我送葬
My son is going to bury me.

1783
01:25:52,990 --> 01:25:56,585
你以为这些人在乎你？才不呢
You think these people give a shit about you?

1784
01:25:55,326 --> 01:25:56,850
They don't.

1785
01:25:56,861 --> 01:25:58,624
你只是暂时的新闻焦点
You're the cause if the moment.

1786
01:25:58,796 --> 01:26:01,458
没有人在乎，这才是事实
Nobody cares, John. That's the real truth.

1787
01:26:01,699 --> 01:26:03,724
没有人在乎，只有你在乎
Nobody cares. Only you.

1788
01:26:05,336 --> 01:26:07,065
只有你跟我
And it's only you and out here...

1789
01:26:07,204 --> 01:26:10,696
还有这些指着你的枪
...and all these guns pointed at you.

1790
01:26:10,841 --> 01:26:14,333
你要怎么做？由你决定

1791
01:26:12,443 --> 01:26:14,240
So, what do you want to do? It's your call.

1792
01:26:14,478 --> 01:26:16,105
我要我儿子
I want my son.

1793
01:26:17,214 --> 01:26:19,944
我要我儿子进来陪我
I want my son inside with me!

1794
01:26:20,184 --> 01:26:21,378
不行
Can't do it, John.

1795
01:26:21,686 --> 01:26:24,587
把我儿子送来，我就放了枪手
You give my boy, I give you your sniper.

1796
01:26:24,655 --> 01:26:25,781
一切就结束
Then it's all over.

1797
01:26:27,825 --> 01:26:29,918
把我儿子送来
You bring my son...

1798
01:26:30,394 --> 01:26:31,588
我投降
...I give up.

1799
01:26:32,964 --> 01:26:34,556
大家都回家
...everybody goes home.

1800
01:26:37,501 --> 01:26:39,833
大家也都平安无事
Everybody's safe.

1801
01:26:43,074 --> 01:26:45,133
把我儿子送来
You bring me my son.

1802
01:26:46,010 --> 01:26:46,942
走吧
Come on.

1803
01:26:47,645 --> 01:26:48,441
好吧
All right.

1804
01:26:50,481 --> 01:26:51,948
你觉得如何？
What do you think, Frank?

1805
01:26:53,384 --> 01:26:55,409
我想就送给他吧
I say give it to him.

1806
01:26:55,553 --> 01:26:57,111
他儿子进去，他就不会杀人
He won't hurt anybody with his boy in here.

1807
01:26:57,254 --> 01:26:59,449
我们要救人质，不是送人质
The object is get hostages out, not to bring them in.

1808
01:26:59,657 --> 01:27:01,784
那不是人质，那是他儿子
It's not a hostage. It's his son.

1809
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:05,258
这些人都没看过新闻吗？
Have all these people been on the new?

1810
01:27:06,063 --> 01:27:07,724
看你的了，法兰
It's your call, Frank.

1811
01:27:09,633 --> 01:27:10,657
好
Yeah.

1812
01:27:13,237 --> 01:27:14,568
好吧，把他送进去
All right, give it to him.

1813
01:27:17,041 --> 01:27:18,736
停，不行K
Hold it. No-N-No.

1814
01:27:18,876 --> 01:27:22,039
我是他母亲，我要跟着去
I'm his mother. I need to be in there!

1815
01:27:25,816 --> 01:27:27,613
别过来，停
Stop right there. Stop.

1816
01:27:27,752 --> 01:27:30,277
走开，快走开
Go. Beat it. Go.

1817
01:27:30,755 --> 01:27:32,586
快、快
Go! Go!

1818
01:27:46,670 --> 01:27:47,830
麻烦大了，约翰
We're in trouble, John.

1819
01:27:48,072 --> 01:27:50,233
麦克的血压降到四十几了
Mike's blood pressure's dropped into the mid-40's.

1820
01:27:50,641 --> 01:27:53,371
心房血压应该只有十几
His atrial blood pressure should be in the low teens.

1821
01:27:53,511 --> 01:27:54,443
现在是35
It's 35.

1822
01:27:54,645 --> 01:27:55,612
对不起，约翰
I'm sorry, John.

1823
01:27:56,013 --> 01:27:57,275
没有新的心脏
Without a new heart...

1824
01:27:58,449 --> 01:28:00,144
他是活不了的
...he's not going to make it.

1825
01:28:03,587 --> 01:28:04,747
好吧
Okay.

1826
01:28:06,891 --> 01:28:08,119
就用我的
You take mine.

1827
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:09,719
什么？
- What? - You heard me.

1828
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:10,849
你听见了
Take my heart and you put it in Mike.

1829
01:28:10,995 --> 01:28:13,725
拿我的心脏给麦克用

1830
01:28:13,898 --> 01:28:16,389
老兄，你真是疯了
Man, you done lost your damn mind.

1831
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:17,328
你不是认真的吧
- You can't be serious. - You bet I'm serious.

1832
01:28:17,501 --> 01:28:19,833
我是认真的，我很认真

1833
01:28:19,970 --> 01:28:21,528
老天爷
I'm dead serious.

1834
01:28:20,070 --> 01:28:21,002
Oh, my God.

1835
01:28:22,039 --> 01:28:23,666
那意味着你会死
- That means you'll be dead. - And my son will live.

1836
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:25,002
而我儿子会活
- You can't do this. - It's the only way.

1837
01:28:25,142 --> 01:28:25,972
你不能这么做

1838
01:28:26,110 --> 01:28:26,804
这是唯一的方法
No, physically, you can't do this.

1839
01:28:26,944 --> 01:28:28,935
你不懂，生理上你不能这么做

1840
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:31,310
我可以，我杀了自己
Yes, I can. I kill myself.

1841
01:28:31,682 --> 01:28:34,242
你剖开我，拿走心脏，很完美
You open me up, you take my heart. It's perfect.

1842
01:28:34,385 --> 01:28:35,647
天，这疯狂了
Man, that's just crazy.

1843
01:28:35,786 --> 01:28:38,311
不能这样就把你的心移给麦克
No, we can't just remove your heart and put it in Michael's body.

1844
01:28:38,456 --> 01:28:39,753
还有很多未知因素
Too many unknowns.

1845
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:42,791
捐赠者跟受赠者的比对程序复杂
Matching a donor and a recipient is complicated.

1846
01:28:42,927 --> 01:28:44,622
有很多重要的检验要做
- There are critical tests to be done.

1847
01:28:44,762 --> 01:28:45,285
比方说呢？
- Like what?

1848
01:28:45,429 --> 01:28:47,556
互相比对血型、胸腔大小
Cross-matches for blood type, chest cavity measurements.

1849
01:28:47,698 --> 01:28:49,825
要是血型不符
If both blood tissues are not compatible.

1850
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,865
我都知道，我们仔细比对过
I know all about compatibility.

1851
01:28:52,002 --> 01:28:56,063
我们都是B型阳性，组织吻合
We're both B-positive, our tissues match...

1852
01:28:56,207 --> 01:28:59,142
他心脏比正常大三倍 我的可以
...his heart's three times the size of a normal, so will fit.

1853
01:28:59,276 --> 01:29:00,641
你知道我们很合
You know we're compatible.

1854
01:29:00,778 --> 01:29:02,143
这是不可能的
It's out of the question.

1855
01:29:02,279 --> 01:29:04,543
医生，我说可以
Doc, I'm telling you he will make it.

1856
01:29:04,648 --> 01:29:06,206
不行，约翰，不行
Can't do it. John. No.

1857
01:29:06,350 --> 01:29:07,612
要是我死了
So if I'm dead.

1858
01:29:07,751 --> 01:29:09,616
你也不会拿我的心去救他？
You're not going to take heart and save his life?

1859
01:29:09,753 --> 01:29:13,154
你宁可让两个人死也不动手？
You'll let two people die instead of one because of a technicality?

1860
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:15,520
我认为约翰是对的
I think what John is trying to do is right.

1861
01:29:15,626 --> 01:29:17,526
我认为他很勇敢
I think it's so brave.

1862
01:29:17,595 --> 01:29:19,893
麦克会想要吗？你太太呢？
What do you think Mike would want?

1863
01:29:20,064 --> 01:29:22,294
麦克还小，他不懂什么对他好
What about your wife?

1864
01:29:20,264 --> 01:29:21,731
Mike's too young to know what's good for him.

1865
01:29:22,466 --> 01:29:24,195
我是他父亲，我有责任保护他
I'm his father. It's my job to protect him.

1866
01:29:24,368 --> 01:29:25,528
何况，狄妮也会做一样的事
Besides, Denise would do the same thing.

1867
01:29:25,703 --> 01:29:28,467
约翰，听着
John, look.

1868
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:30,904
我知道麦克的情况很不好
I know what's happening to Mike is bad, man.

1869
01:29:31,041 --> 01:29:32,599
事实上，根本就很糟
Matter of fact, it's the worst.

1870
01:29:32,743 --> 01:29:35,303
但自杀并不能解决事情
But killing yourself ain't going to solve a damn thing.

1871
01:29:35,946 --> 01:29:37,937
有时你必须放手
Sometimes you just got to let go.

1872
01:29:38,082 --> 01:29:39,640
让上帝接手
And let God.

1873
01:29:40,518 --> 01:29:42,452
接受它吧，兄弟
Just accept it, brother.

1874
01:29:43,154 --> 01:29:44,382
接受它
Accept it.

1875
01:29:45,856 --> 01:29:47,289
接受什么？
Accept what?

1876
01:29:49,026 --> 01:29:50,550
接受什么？
Accept what?

1877
01:29:50,761 --> 01:29:51,728
麦克会死
- That Mike is going to die. - No, I don't accept that.

1878
01:29:51,862 --> 01:29:55,457
不，我不接受

1879
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:57,060
绝不
Ever!

1880
01:29:58,636 --> 01:30:01,161
我绝对不接受，听着
No, I reject that out of hand.

1881
01:30:01,338 --> 01:30:03,772
他对你而言只是病人，我明白
I mean, look.

1882
01:30:02,139 --> 01:30:04,073
All right, he's a patient to you. I understand.

1883
01:30:03,908 --> 01:30:06,035
他是个好孩子
He's a good kid.

1884
01:30:06,177 --> 01:30:09,146
他喜欢健身
I mean, he loves bodybuilding.

1885
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:11,840
他想当健美先生，你相信吗？
He wants to be a bodybuilder.

1886
01:30:11,982 --> 01:30:14,974
他也很幽默，你会喜欢他的
Can you believe that?

1887
01:30:12,082 --> 01:30:15,176
And he's funny. You' d like him.

1888
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:18,188
你会喜欢他的，若你能认识他
You'd like him, doc, if you got to know him.

1889
01:30:18,322 --> 01:30:19,311
我是很喜欢他
I do like him. All right, then.

1890
01:30:19,456 --> 01:30:21,856
那就求求你，我求你
Then please, I'm just begging you.

1891
01:30:21,992 --> 01:30:22,959
别管那些规定了
- Step outside the rules. - I'd like to, John. I really would.

1892
01:30:23,093 --> 01:30:24,993
我想，我真的很想

1893
01:30:25,329 --> 01:30:28,389
但你的请求太过份了
But what you're asking crosses the line.

1894
01:30:28,566 --> 01:30:29,726
这完全是不道德的
It is completely unethical.

1895
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:32,164
我太过份？你才太过份了
I'm crossing he line?

1896
01:30:32,303 --> 01:30:34,066
整个制度都太过份了，谁在乎
You're crossing the line.

1897
01:30:32,302 --> 01:30:34,167
The whole system crossing the line. Who cares?

1898
01:30:34,205 --> 01:30:35,934
也许你不明白我在说什么
Maybe you don' understand what I'm talking about.

1899
01:30:36,073 --> 01:30:39,975
我不在乎，我儿子要活下去
I don't give a damn.

1900
01:30:38,242 --> 01:30:39,675
My son's going to live.

1901
01:30:40,110 --> 01:30:41,771
也许你还没搞清楚
Maybe you haven't figured it out.

1902
01:30:41,912 --> 01:30:44,642
我会尽一切力量让他活下去
I'll do whatever I got to do for him to live.

1903
01:30:44,782 --> 01:30:46,340
那你打算怎么办？
So, what are you going to do?

1904
01:30:47,017 --> 01:30:49,315
我不动手术你就杀我？
You're going to shoot me if I don't operate?

1905
01:30:49,687 --> 01:30:50,881
不
No.

1906
01:30:51,956 --> 01:30:53,446
我会自杀
I'll kill myself.

1907
01:30:55,626 --> 01:30:56,820
好吗？
All right?

1908
01:30:57,094 --> 01:30:58,755
看事情会怎么样
Let's just see what happens.

1909
01:30:59,196 --> 01:31:01,892
不就是这样吗？他需要捐赠人
That's what this is all about, right? He needs donate

1910
01:31:02,066 --> 01:31:03,693
总要有人死，好让他活
Somebody's got to die in order for him to live.

1911
01:31:03,867 --> 01:31:06,335
我是他父亲，就是我了
I'm his father. It's me.

1912
01:31:15,246 --> 01:31:16,611
好吧
All right.

1913
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:18,170
好吧？好什么？
All right? All right what?

1914
01:31:18,449 --> 01:31:19,677
你想要我动手就动手吧
- I'll do it if that's what you want. - You'll let him kill himself?

1915
01:31:19,817 --> 01:31:21,216
你是说你要让他自杀？

1916
01:31:21,352 --> 01:31:23,286
他若死了，有何不可？
Once he's dead, why not?

1917
01:31:23,554 --> 01:31:26,045
你是我认识最好的外科医生
You are the finest surgeon I know.

1918
01:31:26,190 --> 01:31:28,658
你不能为这人搞砸你的事业
You cannot throw your career away for this man.

1919
01:31:28,792 --> 01:31:30,953
医生，你动手就完了
Doctor, if you do this, you're finished.

1920
01:31:31,095 --> 01:31:32,960
他们会怎样？告我吗？
You know that right?

1921
01:31:31,361 --> 01:31:32,623
What are they going to do? Sue me?

1922
01:31:33,130 --> 01:31:34,620
吊销执照？
Disbar me?

1923
01:31:35,266 --> 01:31:37,393
把我赶出俱乐部
Evict me from the country club?

1924
01:31:37,668 --> 01:31:39,898
不，这里还是医院
No. This is still a hospital.

1925
01:31:40,471 --> 01:31:42,200
只要有心脏可用
If there's a heart available.

1926
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:44,402
我就不能浪费它
I'm not going to let it go to waste.

1927
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:47,635
医生，麦先生，准备手术
Doctor, Mr. Maguire, let's get ready for surgery.

1928
01:32:14,938 --> 01:32:16,337
准备收成吧

1929
01:32:17,775 --> 01:32:20,175
好，快点，各位
Get ready to harvest.

1930
01:32:19,376 --> 01:32:20,638
All right, hurry up, guys.

1931
01:32:21,445 --> 01:32:22,742
把她放上手术台
Get her on the table.

1932
01:32:23,013 --> 01:32:24,105
有多少时间？
What's our time?

1933
01:32:24,248 --> 01:32:25,408
准备抬起来
Ready to lift.

1934
01:32:27,017 --> 01:32:28,416
45分
Oh-four-five.

1935
01:32:32,723 --> 01:32:33,883
摊开手术刀
Scalpels laid out. Where's the tray?

1936
01:32:34,024 --> 01:32:35,218
托盘呢？你有吗？
You have the other in front of you?

1937
01:32:35,359 --> 01:32:37,486
把车推进来
Bring the cart around, please.

1938
01:32:44,001 --> 01:32:45,093
情况如何？
What do we have?

1939
01:32:45,536 --> 01:32:46,867
女性捐赠者
Female donor.

1940
01:32:47,004 --> 01:32:48,471
26岁
26 years old...

1941
01:32:48,672 --> 01:32:50,537
身高五尺七
...five-foot-seven.

1942
01:32:50,674 --> 01:32:52,471
肝脏、肾脏堪用
Liver, kidneys usable.

1943
01:32:52,676 --> 01:32:55,042
肝脏、肾脏都堪用
Liver and kidneys are both usable.

1944
01:32:55,312 --> 01:32:56,404
肺脏呢？
- Lungs? - Okay.

1945
01:32:56,547 --> 01:32:57,639
很好
Lungs are okay.

1946
01:32:57,748 --> 01:32:58,442
肺脏很好
- Heart? - Heart is good.

1947
01:32:58,582 --> 01:32:59,378
心脏呢？

1948
01:32:59,516 --> 01:33:00,346
心脏很好
Heart is good. Blood type?

1949
01:33:00,484 --> 01:33:02,452
心脏很好，血型？

1950
01:33:03,620 --> 01:33:05,349
B型阳性
B-positive.

1951
01:33:08,592 --> 01:33:10,253
这是我的K
This is my...

1952
01:33:12,696 --> 01:33:14,186
我的遗嘱
...my will.

1953
01:33:15,632 --> 01:33:18,601
上面写我自愿把心脏给我儿子
It says I'm leaving my heart to my son,

1954
01:33:18,869 --> 01:33:21,099
我需要两个证人签名
And I need two witnesses to sign.

1955
01:33:21,238 --> 01:33:22,364
我不要签
I'm not signing that.

1956
01:33:22,506 --> 01:33:24,269
我才不要看着你自杀
I ain't going to watch you kill yourself.

1957
01:33:24,541 --> 01:33:25,701
我也是
Me neither.

1958
01:33:25,843 --> 01:33:28,209
你们越快签，就越快回家
The sooner you sign it, the sooner you go home.

1959
01:33:30,347 --> 01:33:32,872
好，我签
Okay. I'll sign.

1960
01:33:33,117 --> 01:33:34,277
我也是
Me too.

1961
01:33:40,624 --> 01:33:41,591
好了
Okay.

1962
01:33:44,862 --> 01:33:47,194
你就这样进去轰了自己？
You're just going to go in there and off yourself?

1963
01:33:47,364 --> 01:33:48,695
只有一件事能阻止我
- Only one thing will stop me. - What's that?

1964
01:33:48,866 --> 01:33:49,924
什么事？

1965
01:33:50,267 --> 01:33:51,666
如果米区血型是B型阳性
If Mitch is B-positive.

1966
01:33:51,802 --> 01:33:56,000
不是，是O型，我发誓
No, no, no. Type O, swear to God.

1967
01:34:00,878 --> 01:34:02,038
谢谢你
Thank you.

1968
01:34:02,413 --> 01:34:04,210
你要保重
You be good. Be careful.

1969
01:34:17,761 --> 01:34:19,456
等着上报吧
See you in the funny papers.

1970
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:31,606
我能跟他谈谈吗？
Can I have a word with him?

1971
01:34:34,545 --> 01:34:35,409
谢谢你
Thank you.

1972
01:34:59,102 --> 01:35:00,296
麦克
Hey, Mike.

1973
01:35:01,572 --> 01:35:02,561
麦克

1974
01:35:03,974 --> 01:35:05,236
Mikey.

1975
01:35:13,917 --> 01:35:15,214
你好吗？
How you doing, buddy?

1976
01:35:15,352 --> 01:35:17,217
爸
Hey, Dad.

1977
01:35:18,188 --> 01:35:21,555
你帮我弄到新的心脏了？
Did you bring me a new heart?

1978
01:35:24,628 --> 01:35:26,459
是啊，弄到了
Yeah, we got you one.

1979
01:35:27,030 --> 01:35:29,555
你一定是命中有贵人
I guess you got a guardian angel.

1980
01:35:30,234 --> 01:35:34,671
麦克，先别睡着，好吗？
Mike, try to stay awake for a minute, okay?

1981
01:35:34,972 --> 01:35:37,406
我要跟你说一些事
I just need to tell you a few things.

1982
01:35:38,141 --> 01:35:40,075
好
Okay, Dad.

1983
01:35:44,748 --> 01:35:47,649
你要听你妈的话
You always listen to your mother.

1984
01:35:48,185 --> 01:35:49,675
你明白吗
You understand?

1985
01:35:50,254 --> 01:35:52,279
照她说话的去做
Do what she tells you to do.

1986
01:35:55,025 --> 01:35:56,993
她是你最要好的朋友
She's your best friend.

1987
01:35:58,262 --> 01:36:00,321
每天都要告诉她你爱她
Tell her you love her every day.

1988
01:36:00,497 --> 01:36:02,021
好
Okay, Dad.

1989
01:36:04,001 --> 01:36:08,370
你现在交女朋友还太早
You're too young for girls right now...

1990
01:36:08,505 --> 01:36:12,566
但时候总是会到的
...but there's going to come a time.

1991
01:36:13,243 --> 01:36:14,301
到时候
And when it does.

1992
01:36:14,444 --> 01:36:16,844
你要像公主般对待她们
You treat them like princesses...

1993
01:36:17,748 --> 01:36:19,579
因为她们就是公主
...because that's what they are.

1994
01:36:23,453 --> 01:36:25,853
当你说要做什么K
When you say you're going to do something...

1995
01:36:42,072 --> 01:36:44,939
当你说要做什么时，一定要做
When you say you're going to do something, you do it.

1996
01:36:47,477 --> 01:36:49,468
因为你是言出必行的人
Because your word is your bond, son.

1997
01:36:49,646 --> 01:36:51,079
你一定要这样
It's all you have.

1998
01:36:53,650 --> 01:36:56,517
还有钱，有机会就要赚钱
And money. You make money if you get a chance.

1999
01:36:56,653 --> 01:36:58,848
纵使你必须偶尔昧着良心
Even if you got to sell out once in a while.

2000
01:36:58,989 --> 01:37:00,183
你也要设法赚钱
Make as much money as you can.

2001
01:37:00,324 --> 01:37:01,848
别跟你爸一样笨
Don't be stupid like your father.

2002
01:37:01,992 --> 01:37:02,959
好
Okay.

2003
01:37:03,093 --> 01:37:06,085
有钱会让你过得更顺利
Everything is so much easier with money, son.

2004
01:37:08,065 --> 01:37:09,532
别抽烟
Don't smoke.

2005
01:37:13,337 --> 01:37:15,897
对人要友善
Be kind to people.

2006
01:37:16,239 --> 01:37:17,968
要是有人杠上你
If somebody chooses you.

2007
01:37:18,342 --> 01:37:21,743
你要面对他，要像个男人
You stand up, you be a man.

2008
01:37:23,313 --> 01:37:29,309
别靠近不好的东西，拜托
You stay away from the bad things, son. Please.

2009
01:37:31,054 --> 01:37:33,750
别跟坏东西沾上边
Don't get caught up in the bad things.

2010
01:37:35,892 --> 01:37:39,157
世上有很多美好的事物等着你
There's so many great thing out there for you.

2011
01:37:48,805 --> 01:37:51,069
我永远不会离开你的
I'll never leave you.

2012
01:37:59,983 --> 01:38:02,076
我永远与你同在
I'm always with you.

2013
01:38:05,722 --> 01:38:07,212
就在这里
Right there.

2014
01:38:13,430 --> 01:38:14,920
我爱你
I love you, son.

2015
01:38:39,890 --> 01:38:41,448
回头见了
I'll see you later.

2016
01:38:59,976 --> 01:39:02,171
“麦克亚契”

2017
01:39:05,949 --> 01:39:08,179
我的老天爷
Oh, my sweet Jesus.

2018
01:39:22,132 --> 01:39:24,225
好，动手吧
Okay, let's do it.

2019
01:39:45,222 --> 01:39:48,885
等等，那枪一直都没装子弹？
Wait a minute. You gun was empty the whole time?

2020
01:39:49,025 --> 01:39:51,721
对，我只是唬人
Yeah, I'm all talk.

2021
01:39:52,796 --> 01:39:55,264
我只想过要杀掉自己
The only one I ever considered to kill is me.

2022
01:40:11,248 --> 01:40:13,239
也许我们该拿些毛巾垫着
Maybe we should get some towels.

2023
01:40:13,650 --> 01:40:14,708
潘小姐、潘小姐
Miss Payne! Miss Payne? Yeah?

2024
01:40:14,851 --> 01:40:15,317
什么事？
You're not going to believe this.

2025
01:40:15,452 --> 01:40:15,975
你不会相信的
- What? - We got a match.

2026
01:40:16,119 --> 01:40:16,517
什么？

2027
01:40:16,653 --> 01:40:17,415
比对吻合了
B-positive, Michael William Archibald.

2028
01:40:17,554 --> 01:40:19,681
B型阳性，麦克亚契

2029
01:40:19,823 --> 01:40:22,018
全国唯一吻合的一级病患
The only status-one in the country.

2030
01:40:22,159 --> 01:40:23,558
我的天啊
I'll be damned.

2031
01:40:43,914 --> 01:40:45,279
我好渴
I'm thirsty.

2032
01:40:50,987 --> 01:40:52,181
亚契太太？
Mrs. Archibald?

2033
01:40:53,723 --> 01:40:55,884
我们有好消息
We have very good news.

2034
01:41:07,504 --> 01:41:08,971
老天爷
Oh, Jesus.

2035
01:41:15,011 --> 01:41:16,603
保险没开
The safety's on.

2036
01:41:16,713 --> 01:41:17,475
这是真的吗？
Is this for real? The Learjet just landed at O'Hare.

2037
01:41:17,647 --> 01:41:20,081
飞机刚降落在芝加哥机场
The helicopter will be here in 15 minutes.

2038
01:41:20,217 --> 01:41:21,707
直升机15分钟内就送到了

2039
01:41:21,852 --> 01:41:23,319
这荣耀归你，好吗？
You do the honors, okay?

2040
01:41:23,453 --> 01:41:25,444
好，说吧
Okay, go?

2041
01:41:27,824 --> 01:41:31,123
约翰，是我
John, baby, it's me.

2042
01:41:32,629 --> 01:41:34,221
约翰
John.

2043
01:41:34,965 --> 01:41:37,456
这没用，约翰？
It's not working. John?

2044
01:41:36,299 --> 01:41:42,238
Please, baby, pick up! John, can you-

2045
01:41:38,768 --> 01:41:42,636
拜托，接起来，约翰

2046
01:41:45,242 --> 01:41:46,732
约翰
John.

2047
01:41:56,553 --> 01:41:59,954
John!

2048
01:42:02,692 --> 01:42:04,683
约翰，这是奇迹，有心脏了
It's a miracle, baby! They found a heart!

2049
01:42:04,928 --> 01:42:07,920
约翰，这是奇迹，有心脏了
John, it's a miracle!

2050
01:42:06,796 --> 01:42:08,286
They found a heart!

2051
01:42:08,498 --> 01:42:09,863
心脏送到了
The heart is here.

2052
01:42:10,133 --> 01:42:13,102
重覆，小麦克的心脏送来了
I repeat, the heart for little Mike Archibald has arrived.

2053
01:42:13,403 --> 01:42:16,964
这真是个不可思议的结局
What an unbelievable ending to this incredible, tumultuous day.

2054
01:42:19,376 --> 01:42:20,343
来了
Okay, here we go.

2055
01:42:24,481 --> 01:42:26,915
没错，人质们陆续出来了
Yes, the hostages are coming out.

2056
01:42:27,417 --> 01:42:29,009
一个、两个K
One, two...

2057
01:42:29,152 --> 01:42:32,644
他们历经痛苦折磨似乎累坏了
They appear to be exhausted from what must've been an excruciating ordeal.

2058
01:42:32,789 --> 01:42:34,950
出来更多人了，挥着手

2059
01:42:35,091 --> 01:42:39,425
自由，终于自由了
More coming out.

2060
01:42:36,126 --> 01:42:37,616
Hands waved in the air.

2061
01:42:37,827 --> 01:42:39,624
Freedom, freedom at last.

2062
01:42:39,796 --> 01:42:42,424
警方护送他们到安全的地方
The police are escorting them to safety.

2063
01:42:42,666 --> 01:42:43,633
你们有什么感觉？
How do you feel?

2064
01:42:43,733 --> 01:42:46,702
大家都出来了，这是约翰
Somebody else is coming. It's John Q.

2065
01:42:47,037 --> 01:42:50,006
约翰出来了，他高举双手
John Q has come out, hand in the air. He's putting the gun down.

2066
01:42:50,173 --> 01:42:52,641
他把枪放下了，似乎要投降
He appears to be surrendering.

2067
01:42:52,742 --> 01:42:53,709
干的好，约翰
Way to go, John!

2068
01:42:53,843 --> 01:42:55,640
警方小心的接近他
The police are approaching.

2069
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:59,808
他们逮住他了，他们压制了约翰
And they've got him.

2070
01:42:58,114 --> 01:42:59,843
They've subdued John Q.

2071
01:43:00,283 --> 01:43:02,877
铐上手铐，一切似乎结束了
The handcuffs are on and it appears to be over.

2072
01:43:03,019 --> 01:43:04,782
完全落幕了
It's all over.

2073
01:43:05,155 --> 01:43:07,555
若说画面能代表千言万语
If pictures speak a thousand words.

2074
01:43:07,691 --> 01:43:10,251
这些影像更能令人感受到震撼
Then these images do speak volumes.

2075
01:43:10,393 --> 01:43:13,885
现在，事件落幕，提醒您K
And now, as the bloody standoff comes to an end, we remind you...

2076
01:43:14,064 --> 01:43:16,055
第八频道是第一个
...that channel eight was here first,

2077
01:43:16,232 --> 01:43:20,293
独家赶到现场连线报导的频道
with moment-to-moment live coverage...

2078
01:43:20,470 --> 01:43:22,631
这是希望纪念医院的危机报导
...of "crisis at Hope Memorial."

2079
01:43:22,772 --> 01:43:24,034
我是蓝塔克
I'm Tuck Lampley.

2080
01:43:33,650 --> 01:43:34,844
开门
Open those doors!

2081
01:43:35,552 --> 01:43:36,678
快点
Coming through.

2082
01:43:47,197 --> 01:43:48,926
我们爱你，约翰
We love you, John!

2083
01:43:49,499 --> 01:43:51,831
上帝保佑你，我也会这么做的
God bless you, John!

2084
01:43:50,433 --> 01:43:51,627
I'd do the same thing!

2085
01:43:53,169 --> 01:43:54,295
加油，约翰
Go, John!

2086
01:44:18,028 --> 01:44:19,052
心脏
Heart.

2087
01:44:21,398 --> 01:44:22,194
谢谢
Thank you.

2088
01:44:25,168 --> 01:44:26,328
长剪
Metzenbaums.

2089
01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:31,939
他很衰弱
He's hypostenic.

2090
01:44:32,909 --> 01:44:34,001
等等
Wait a second.

2091
01:44:48,458 --> 01:44:51,086
为我戴上它们吧，可以吗？
Put these on for, would you do that?

2092
01:44:51,227 --> 01:44:52,285
慢慢来
Take your time.

2093
01:45:04,407 --> 01:45:05,874
拉起来
Life it.

2094
01:45:07,477 --> 01:45:08,944
好
All right.

2095
01:45:09,079 --> 01:45:10,137
完成了
Done.

2096
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:11,178
升高血压
- Pressure up. - Pressure up.

2097
01:45:11,314 --> 01:45:12,781
升高血压

2098
01:45:14,017 --> 01:45:17,009
一、二、三
One, two, three.

2099
01:45:24,094 --> 01:45:25,061
成功了
It worked!

2100
01:45:25,295 --> 01:45:28,753
成功了，约翰，成功了
It worked, John! It worked!

2101
01:45:39,642 --> 01:45:40,734
又是一桩案例
The other big story...

2102
01:45:40,877 --> 01:45:43,812
约翰被控绑架与企图谋杀
...John Q goes on trial today for kidnapping

2103
01:45:43,947 --> 01:45:47,439
全因为HMO拒绝给付
and attempted murder charges.

2104
01:45:44,981 --> 01:45:47,347
All because an HMO denied coverage

2105
01:45:47,650 --> 01:45:49,174
他儿子的心脏移植手术
For his son's heart transplant.

2106
01:45:49,319 --> 01:45:52,516
未来更糟，HMO会拒绝承保
It'll be more expensive for you, HMO's, to deny coverage when people need it.

2107
01:45:52,655 --> 01:45:56,955
还有四千万美国人没有保险
There are still 40 million Americans who are uninsured.

2108
01:45:57,093 --> 01:46:01,587
今晚，约翰亚契的审判继续着
Tonight, as the trial continues,

2109
01:45:59,662 --> 01:46:01,493
John Quincy Archibald:

2110
01:46:01,764 --> 01:46:03,823
他是坏蛋还是好父亲？
Vigilante or heroic father? You decide.

2111
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,228
你来决定
Sue the pants off them for millions of dollars to let them know...

2112
01:46:05,401 --> 01:46:08,097
告垮他们，好让他们知道K

2113
01:46:08,238 --> 01:46:13,904
我们早知道这个健保系统很烂

2114
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:15,074
We've know for years that this is a crappy health care system.

2115
01:46:14,043 --> 01:46:17,638
政府根本不在乎我们
The government don't care about us.

2116
01:46:17,780 --> 01:46:21,307
我想约翰用的是信心健保计划
I guess John Q was using one of those faith-bassed health care plans.

2117
01:46:21,451 --> 01:46:24,386
你只能祈祷，政府才不管你
That's where you just pray, and the government does nothing.

2118
01:46:24,521 --> 01:46:27,251
重点是我们的敌人
The point is that the enemy

2119
01:46:27,357 --> 01:46:28,756
根本就是我们自己
That we're trying to identify is us.

2120
01:46:28,892 --> 01:46:29,916
那才是重点
That's the point.

2121
01:46:30,059 --> 01:46:32,926
我们才是终结健保系统的人
We are the ones who shot down national health care.

2122
01:46:33,096 --> 01:46:34,859
“三个月后”
We are the ones who don't want our taxes raised.

2123
01:46:35,031 --> 01:46:36,760
我们不希望税金提高
You have to look in the mirror for this problem.

2124
01:46:36,933 --> 01:46:38,764
你们必须仔细审视这个问题

2125
01:46:39,936 --> 01:46:43,030
退后，拜托，退后
Back up. Come on, back up.

2126
01:46:43,306 --> 01:46:46,707
就回答一个问题吧
Just one question, please!

2127
01:46:48,478 --> 01:46:49,775
退后
Back up.

2128
01:46:54,918 --> 01:46:56,977
让开，走吧
Out of the way. Let's go.

2129
01:46:58,054 --> 01:47:00,887
你现在有何感觉，约翰？
How are you feeling right now, John?

2130
01:47:02,425 --> 01:47:06,361
陪审团是否已达成判决？

2131
01:47:16,739 --> 01:47:18,570
是的，庭上
Has the jury reached a verdict?

2132
01:47:18,775 --> 01:47:23,610
第一项罪名，蓄意谋杀
We have, Your Honor.

2133
01:47:20,810 --> 01:47:23,779
As to count one: Attempted murder...

2134
