1
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:12,512
That's the same old jive that's been
run now for the past 300 years.

2
00:03:12,676 --> 00:03:15,509
If you're all so wise and heavy,
why didn't you join the strike?

3
00:03:15,676 --> 00:03:19,191
No, you just go back and tell them,
sorry, this motherfucker is closed down.

4
00:03:19,356 --> 00:03:21,426
On strike, Jack.
We'll whistle when it's over.

5
00:03:21,596 --> 00:03:23,109
Right.
Yeah.

6
00:03:23,276 --> 00:03:25,790
Why doesn't the Strike Committee
add some of our demands?

7
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,628
- Like ending ROTC.
Ha.

8
00:03:27,796 --> 00:03:29,514
You wanna off ROTC?

9
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,236
All you have to do
is go down to the ROTC building...

10
00:03:32,396 --> 00:03:34,546
...take a bottle, fill it full of gasoline.

11
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:36,752
- Plug it with a rag....
- Yeah.

12
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,986
Yeah, man,
but what if you wanna end sociology?

13
00:03:39,156 --> 00:03:42,831
Listen, man, a Molotov cocktail
is a mixture of gasoline and kerosene.

14
00:03:42,996 --> 00:03:45,430
A white radical is a mixture
of bullshit and jive.

15
00:03:45,596 --> 00:03:47,075
Right on, right on.

16
00:03:49,556 --> 00:03:53,071
You know, I don't have to
prove my revolutionary credentials to you.

17
00:03:53,236 --> 00:03:56,194
There's a lot of white students
who are already out on the streets...

18
00:03:56,356 --> 00:03:58,586
...fighting just like you guys do
in the ghetto.

19
00:03:58,756 --> 00:04:01,828
And you know, there's a lot of unhappy,
dissatisfied white people...

20
00:04:01,996 --> 00:04:03,907
...who are potential revolutionaries.

21
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:07,034
Y'all are dealing with things
that are really irrelevant.

22
00:04:07,196 --> 00:04:09,152
But you, you're going back
to the same thing.

23
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:12,035
You get busted for grass
and that makes you a revolutionary.

24
00:04:12,196 --> 00:04:14,232
No, when the pigs
are busting your head...

25
00:04:14,396 --> 00:04:16,193
...they're kicking down your door...

26
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,075
...when you can't get a job,
can't go to school, can't eat...

27
00:04:19,236 --> 00:04:21,147
...that's what makes you a revolutionary.

28
00:04:21,316 --> 00:04:23,876
That's why black people are,
like you say, in another bag.

29
00:04:24,036 --> 00:04:27,949
No, we're talking about
talking to white students, that is, right?

30
00:04:28,116 --> 00:04:32,109
I think we understand- We understood
what makes black people revolutionaries.

31
00:04:32,276 --> 00:04:35,074
But what's gonna make
white people revolutionaries?

32
00:04:35,236 --> 00:04:37,466
Same thing to make
black people revolutionaries-

33
00:04:37,636 --> 00:04:39,672
But it's not happening in the same way.

34
00:04:39,836 --> 00:04:41,155
You just wait, it will happen.

35
00:04:41,316 --> 00:04:44,308
You don't have to do anything to
instigate it. You can prevent it.

36
00:04:44,476 --> 00:04:46,387
You can break it down,
you can do something.

37
00:04:46,556 --> 00:04:49,628
But I think this country
is going pell-mell into fascism.

38
00:04:49,796 --> 00:04:52,185
The pigs are on the campus now.
Where do you want them?

39
00:04:52,356 --> 00:04:54,824
Sitting up in the classroom,
you want them in your door?

40
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:57,669
You want them standing on the street
every time you walk out?

41
00:04:57,836 --> 00:05:00,589
Do you have to wait till we get to that
to be revolutionary?

42
00:05:00,756 --> 00:05:03,634
But what we're saying is this school
is gonna close down, period.

43
00:05:03,796 --> 00:05:07,835
There ain't nobody coming in this school
unless they come at their own risk.

44
00:05:07,996 --> 00:05:10,556
And once they decide
they want their school back open...

45
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:12,946
...they're gonna open it up
on our terms, period.

46
00:05:13,116 --> 00:05:15,835
Why stop the students that wanna go?
I mean-

47
00:05:15,996 --> 00:05:17,349
Because they're in our way.

48
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:19,871
Because they prevent us
from getting what we deserve.

49
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:22,630
We have tried all other means,
we negotiated, we pleaded...

50
00:05:22,796 --> 00:05:25,469
...we've written programs,
we haven't got anything.

51
00:05:25,636 --> 00:05:27,467
All right.
Now you understand that?

52
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:36,705
Well, the whole point, a basic point
of any form of guerilla confrontation...

53
00:05:36,876 --> 00:05:39,549
...is that the enemy is invisible,
things happen.

54
00:05:39,716 --> 00:05:42,025
They don't know where,
they don't know how.

55
00:05:42,196 --> 00:05:43,231
People that do things...

56
00:05:43,396 --> 00:05:46,308
...and the people who they
have their attention focused on...

57
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:48,910
...are being nothing
but attracting attention.

58
00:05:49,076 --> 00:05:50,987
I don't think
that's the stage we're at yet.

59
00:05:51,156 --> 00:05:52,635
We're just beginning to involve-

60
00:05:52,796 --> 00:05:55,390
If you wanna shut this school down,
what do you plan to do?

61
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:58,070
We do not have white support
on this campus yet.

62
00:05:58,236 --> 00:06:02,548
Wait a minute, the Black Student Union
is not running no performance.

63
00:06:02,716 --> 00:06:05,150
We're gonna depend on that
to shut this school down.

64
00:06:05,316 --> 00:06:07,432
This discussion about the enemy
being invisible.

65
00:06:07,596 --> 00:06:11,305
You're wrong. In terms of white support,
I don't think it matters that much...

66
00:06:11,476 --> 00:06:15,515
...because if we're successful tomorrow,
what will happen is that the cops...

67
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:18,873
...will consider every single student
whether he's on the picket line...

68
00:06:19,036 --> 00:06:21,675
...or whether he's one of us or not,
every student an enemy.

69
00:06:21,836 --> 00:06:23,030
And once that happens...

70
00:06:23,196 --> 00:06:26,506
...if we keep up the pressure,
then it will be a popular white threat.

71
00:06:26,676 --> 00:06:29,634
Black or white,
leave it for the other motherfuckers.

72
00:06:29,796 --> 00:06:32,356
We've run out of coffee.
Could you fix up a new pot?

73
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:34,427
Can't a man make coffee
around here anymore?

74
00:06:34,596 --> 00:06:36,985
Yeah, good for you.
Make it yourself.

75
00:06:37,156 --> 00:06:40,034
I say that we form four- or five-man
attack squads of our own...

76
00:06:40,196 --> 00:06:42,027
...to be stationed outside of the campus.

77
00:06:42,196 --> 00:06:44,107
When the cops move in
on the strike lines...

78
00:06:44,276 --> 00:06:47,348
...they move, form a diversionary force
behind the cops...

79
00:06:47,516 --> 00:06:50,269
...so the picket lines,
they have time to get out of their way.

80
00:06:50,436 --> 00:06:53,792
- Wait a minute, now. Wait a minute.
Aren't cars an effective blockade?

81
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:55,105
- Cars?
Cars.

82
00:06:55,276 --> 00:06:56,914
On a campus?
Sure.

83
00:06:57,076 --> 00:06:59,874
- Strategically-
Wait, how about your car?

84
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:04,866
It's a Ford Falcon, man. Go ahead.

85
00:07:05,036 --> 00:07:07,345
You drive it up, Jack. I'll tip it over.

86
00:07:07,516 --> 00:07:08,915
Well, I ain't gonna tip it over.

87
00:07:09,076 --> 00:07:12,512
The reason why we're trying to
make change right here on the campus-

88
00:07:14,036 --> 00:07:15,992
But we can't live
in the community, man.

89
00:07:16,156 --> 00:07:17,953
What do you want?
What do you want us to do?

90
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:23,795
Order.

91
00:07:23,956 --> 00:07:27,346
There's only one way to talk to
the Man and that's in his own language.

92
00:07:27,516 --> 00:07:30,110
The Man's language is his guns,
you talk to him with a gun.

93
00:07:30,276 --> 00:07:32,028
- It's very simple.
That's right.

94
00:07:32,196 --> 00:07:35,029
- Are you willing to die?
Black people are dying.

95
00:07:35,196 --> 00:07:37,391
A lot of black people
have died in this country.

96
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:39,706
Black people have earned
this leadership in blood.

97
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,514
We're not gonna give it up.

98
00:07:42,036 --> 00:07:45,870
- Well, I'm willing to die too.
Alone?

99
00:07:50,876 --> 00:07:52,787
But not of boredom.

100
00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:55,150
Who the hell is he?

101
00:07:55,556 --> 00:07:59,151
He's okay, he's my roommate.
I guess meetings just aren't his trip.

102
00:07:59,556 --> 00:08:02,753
Look, man, if he didn't come to join us,
he shouldn't have come at all.

103
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,476
Why the hell not?
How else is he gonna determine-?

104
00:08:05,636 --> 00:08:08,355
What is this, "meetings aren't his trip"?
What is that?

105
00:08:08,516 --> 00:08:11,314
If he wants to be a revolutionary,
he has to work with other people.

106
00:08:11,476 --> 00:08:13,273
This is why he had to come and find out.

107
00:08:13,436 --> 00:08:15,552
What was any revolutionary
without other people?

108
00:08:15,716 --> 00:08:19,345
What was Lenin without his organization?
Castro without his organization?

109
00:08:19,516 --> 00:08:22,269
Even anarchists spend most of their lives
talking in meetings.

110
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:24,028
You ought to take him and go back...

111
00:08:24,196 --> 00:08:26,027
...and start teaching him
on the red book.

112
00:08:26,196 --> 00:08:28,585
Teach him
that if he's gonna be a revolutionary...

113
00:08:28,756 --> 00:08:30,508
...there must be a revolutionary party.

114
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:34,271
That bourgeois individualism that
he's indulging in is gonna get him killed.

115
00:08:34,436 --> 00:08:36,586
Resolutely struggle
against bourgeois individualism.

116
00:08:44,636 --> 00:08:47,867
We had an open door on the third floor,
but it's secure now.

117
00:08:48,676 --> 00:08:50,906
Does the door open to the roof?

118
00:08:51,236 --> 00:08:53,704
Could you-? Well, I mean, could I go up?

119
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,151
Company rules.

120
00:08:55,316 --> 00:08:57,466
I wanted to get a book
I left up there at lunch.

121
00:08:57,636 --> 00:09:00,673
What book?
Why don't you eat in the cafeteria?

122
00:09:00,836 --> 00:09:01,951
How were your days off?

123
00:09:02,116 --> 00:09:03,549
Fine.
See you later.

124
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,305
Well, who could give me permission?

125
00:09:20,676 --> 00:09:22,473
Good evening, Mr. Allen.
- Hello, Tom.

126
00:09:22,636 --> 00:09:24,672
Working late tonight?

127
00:09:27,356 --> 00:09:29,824
Hmm? Oh, yeah, sure. Keeping busy.

128
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:32,188
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I hope so.

129
00:09:32,356 --> 00:09:34,916
I was taking the place
of someone's secretary today...

130
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:37,909
...and I went up to the roof.
I mean, at lunchtime.

131
00:09:38,076 --> 00:09:40,795
- And I left something.
A book.

132
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:44,835
- You do secretarial work, do you?
- It's not something I really dig to do.

133
00:09:44,996 --> 00:09:47,556
I just work when I need the bread.

134
00:11:40,596 --> 00:11:41,915
Ah.

135
00:11:42,276 --> 00:11:43,914
What was that?

136
00:11:44,316 --> 00:11:46,193
A girl from my long gone past.

137
00:11:46,356 --> 00:11:49,507
- What's her name?
- Alice.

138
00:11:50,236 --> 00:11:51,794
My sister.

139
00:12:09,756 --> 00:12:10,745
What's that?

140
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,713
It's an OR form in case of a mass bust.

141
00:12:12,876 --> 00:12:16,107
They release you early
if you fill one out in advance.

142
00:12:16,276 --> 00:12:19,268
- Be prepared, is that your slogan?
- Got to be realistic about it.

143
00:12:19,436 --> 00:12:22,985
Look, the day you don't count on losing
is the day I'll join the movement.

144
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:26,865
What if joining isn't a choice? For
lots of people it's a matter of survival.

145
00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:28,594
- That's what I mean.
- What?

146
00:12:28,756 --> 00:12:30,951
It's serious, it's not a game.

147
00:12:36,396 --> 00:12:37,545
I'm tired of it, man.

148
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:40,025
Kids rapping about violence
and cops doing it.

149
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:43,074
That chick at the meeting said
people only act when they need to.

150
00:12:43,236 --> 00:12:45,192
But I need to sooner than that.

151
00:13:03,396 --> 00:13:07,309
Well, anyway, our line's gonna be in front
of the administration building all day.

152
00:13:07,556 --> 00:13:08,989
Maybe.

153
00:13:15,956 --> 00:13:17,753
Control 1 to 1 L51.

154
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,793
You are now clear, 1 L51.
Continue patrol.

155
00:13:21,396 --> 00:13:23,546
Continue patrol, 1 L51.

156
00:13:23,716 --> 00:13:26,355
Ten-four, 1 L51 out.

157
00:13:27,836 --> 00:13:30,225
- Yes?
- A friend was arrested this morning.

158
00:13:30,396 --> 00:13:32,352
I was wondering
if his case had been settled.

159
00:13:32,516 --> 00:13:34,268
- From one of the colleges?
- Yeah.

160
00:13:34,436 --> 00:13:35,755
Being booked now.

161
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,476
It will be a little while, take a seat.

162
00:13:38,636 --> 00:13:42,470
- You know how long it will take?
- Maybe five minutes, maybe five hours.

163
00:13:42,636 --> 00:13:44,786
Shoo. Thank you.

164
00:14:02,996 --> 00:14:04,588
Empty your pockets.

165
00:14:09,156 --> 00:14:10,430

- William S. Pollit.
- Put your hands up on the cage.

167
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,711
Pollit?
P-O-L-L-I-T.

168
00:14:22,436 --> 00:14:23,994
Any other name, also known as?

169
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:26,624
- None.
- Take off your glasses.

170
00:14:26,796 --> 00:14:28,354
Address?

00:14:28,516 --> 00:14:31,394
1152 South Stoneman.

172
00:14:34,956 --> 00:14:37,470
What city?

00:14:40,996 --> 00:14:44,147
- Occupation?
- Associate professor of History.

174
00:14:44,836 --> 00:14:48,829
That's too long, Bill.
I'll just put down "clerk."

175
00:14:52,756 --> 00:14:54,906
- Any money in that wallet?
- Two dollars.

176
00:14:56,556 --> 00:14:59,150
Some of these people over here
need medical attention.

177
00:14:59,996 --> 00:15:01,395
You didn't say you was a doctor.

178
00:15:41,996 --> 00:15:43,987
Who are you?
- You got a friend of mine here.

179
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:46,465
- Came down to bail him out.
- You're not allowed here.

180
00:15:46,636 --> 00:15:48,228
Thought if you were coming to bail-

181
00:15:48,396 --> 00:15:51,274
You thought? You thought maybe
the rules didn't apply to you?

182
00:15:51,436 --> 00:15:53,950
You thought you're someone special?
Go on, move on.

183
00:15:54,116 --> 00:15:55,629
Hey, man, anything I can do to help?

184
00:15:59,236 --> 00:16:01,227
Now you get a chance
to see your friend.

185
00:16:01,396 --> 00:16:02,385
Let me go.

186
00:16:03,716 --> 00:16:06,276
- Pig!
Pig.

187
00:16:07,316 --> 00:16:08,510
Shit, full of crap.

188
00:16:09,796 --> 00:16:11,707
Keep your hands up there.

189
00:16:11,876 --> 00:16:13,389
Brutality.
Busy day.

190
00:16:14,476 --> 00:16:16,512
Name?
- Karl Marx.

191
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:17,825
How do you spell it?

192
00:16:17,996 --> 00:16:20,112
Ha-ha-ha.
All right.

193
00:16:20,276 --> 00:16:22,153
M- A-R-X.

194
00:16:22,596 --> 00:16:24,871
Ha-ha.
He believed you.

195
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,986
Bye.
Bye.

196
00:16:50,396 --> 00:16:51,385
Help you, boys?

197
00:16:51,556 --> 00:16:54,753
We need some guns right away,
for self-defense.

198
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:58,545
Well, the law is, you buy the guns now,
then we check it out with Sacramento.

199
00:16:58,716 --> 00:17:02,391
See that the record is clean.
You can pick it up in four or five days.

200
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:05,548
But the law was made for peacetime,
this is an emergency.

201
00:17:05,716 --> 00:17:08,913
See, we live in a neighborhood
that's, you know, borderline.

202
00:17:09,076 --> 00:17:11,874
You know what I mean?
We gotta protect our women.

203
00:17:12,036 --> 00:17:14,914
Sure as hell I'm gonna see
that you don't go defenseless.

204
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,873
For your purposes, fellas...

205
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,745
...I wouldn't recommend
anything smaller than a.38.

206
00:17:25,956 --> 00:17:27,514
Say, boys.

207
00:17:29,156 --> 00:17:32,114
One other thing about the law,
it says you can protect your house.

208
00:17:32,276 --> 00:17:34,870
So if you shoot them in the backyard,
drag them inside.

209
00:17:35,036 --> 00:17:37,630
Okay, thank you.

210
00:17:47,396 --> 00:17:50,274
Enjoy the full relaxation of outdoor living.

211
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:53,792
Bask in the desert sun
by your own private pool.

212
00:17:53,956 --> 00:17:56,186
Why be caught up
in the rat race of city life...

213
00:17:56,356 --> 00:17:58,551
...when you can enjoy life
the Sunnydunes way?

214
00:18:00,116 --> 00:18:02,425
Play tennis on emerald green lawns.

215
00:18:02,596 --> 00:18:05,633
Drink fresh mountain water
from oaken buckets.

216
00:18:05,796 --> 00:18:08,151
Breathe the unpolluted air
of the high desert.

217
00:18:08,316 --> 00:18:11,706
Take your son quail shooting
in the wide open spaces.

218
00:18:11,876 --> 00:18:14,026
Who knows,
you might even bag a mountain lion.

219
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:17,395
Get out in the sun
and water your own private garden.

220
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:19,274
Become an independent man.

221
00:18:19,436 --> 00:18:22,985
Forge a life of your own,
like the pioneers who molded the West.

222
00:18:23,156 --> 00:18:26,432
You girls will really enjoy
the fully equipped Sunnydunes kitchen.

223
00:18:26,596 --> 00:18:29,952
Plenty of space for cooking for junior
and for that man of the house.

224
00:18:30,116 --> 00:18:34,746
Play a round of golf on the regulation-size
Sunnydunes 9-hole golf course.

225
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:38,591
And you can putt to your heart's content
on the special practice putting greens.

226
00:18:39,156 --> 00:18:42,910
So stop driving yourself crazy
in that miserable crowded city.

227
00:18:43,076 --> 00:18:48,230
Move out today and start your life over
with our Sunnydunes house in the sun.

228
00:18:48,396 --> 00:18:50,705
Are you taking up flying, Bob?
No, Jane.

229
00:18:50,876 --> 00:18:55,188
That's me personally scanning the desert
for potential Sunnydunes lots.

230
00:18:55,356 --> 00:18:57,392
Just call Sunnydunes 848-68.

231
00:18:57,556 --> 00:18:58,909
What's the number again, Bob?

232
00:18:59,076 --> 00:19:01,067
That's Sunnydunes
Land Development Company...

233
00:19:01,236 --> 00:19:03,306
...Box 82, Los Angeles, California.

234
00:19:12,516 --> 00:19:15,474
The freeway connecting
Los Angeles to the foothills...

235
00:19:15,636 --> 00:19:17,991
...has moved 50,000 residents
to other locations...

236
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:21,193
...while the homes and businesses
have been moved or destroyed...

237
00:19:21,356 --> 00:19:24,154
...according to figures received
by the Housing Administration.

238
00:19:24,316 --> 00:19:27,388
Vietnam. Total U.S. servicemen
killed in Vietnam is nearing 50,000.

239
00:19:27,556 --> 00:19:29,865
With hundreds-
Thousands of our young men return-

240
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,186
- Did you see this?
- What's that?

241
00:19:32,356 --> 00:19:35,189
We have seven centimillionaires now.

242
00:19:35,356 --> 00:19:38,029
- Who's we?
- California.

243
00:19:38,196 --> 00:19:41,632
Texas just had four.
New York still has the most.

244
00:19:41,796 --> 00:19:43,627
Well, so far, that is.

245
00:19:43,796 --> 00:19:45,388
Heh. That's right.

246
00:19:45,556 --> 00:19:49,469
Although a disturbance near the cafeteria
brought in over 200 campus policemen...

247
00:19:49,636 --> 00:19:51,547
...highway patrolmen
and sheriff's deputies.

248
00:19:51,716 --> 00:19:54,788
Twenty-five students were arrested
along with three faculty members...

249
00:19:54,956 --> 00:19:57,311
...believed to be members
of a militant organization.

250
00:19:57,476 --> 00:19:59,785
The governor spoke
at the businessman's luncheon...

251
00:19:59,956 --> 00:20:03,710
...and said the time has come
to remove the campus problem students.

252
00:20:03,876 --> 00:20:06,436
Kaynox checks the weather
from the Kaynox weather tower at-

253
00:20:09,156 --> 00:20:11,795
I've gotta go down there
and see for myself.

254
00:20:18,476 --> 00:20:21,786
After that call, keep the line free,
I might have to call back.

255
00:21:18,876 --> 00:21:21,470
- Morning, sir.
- Morning, Tom. How are you?

256
00:21:30,116 --> 00:21:32,232
Mr. Johnson,
I'm glad you returned my call.

257
00:21:32,396 --> 00:21:34,114
You called a few days ago.

258
00:21:34,276 --> 00:21:36,267
I talked to you
about square B composition...

259
00:21:36,436 --> 00:21:37,949
...on the New York Stock Exchange?

260
00:21:38,116 --> 00:21:41,631
Well, it's getting real active now
and I'd like to see you pick up some.

261
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,191
Uh- Care to see them again?

262
00:21:48,356 --> 00:21:51,792
No thanks, Tim. We'll call your boss
if we decide to make any changes.

263
00:21:51,956 --> 00:21:53,071
Morning, boys.

264
00:21:53,236 --> 00:21:55,704
- Wanna see these?
- Later, I've got that conference.

265
00:21:55,876 --> 00:21:57,787
- What time is your plane?
- Couple of hours.

266
00:23:00,996 --> 00:23:03,146
Yes, sir?
- Natalie, where's Daria?

267
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:05,955
I don't know, sir. I haven't seen her.

268
00:23:06,796 --> 00:23:08,912
- Try her at home, will you?
- Yes, sir.

269
00:23:22,436 --> 00:23:25,633
I called Daria's home, sir,
but there's no answer.

270
00:23:25,796 --> 00:23:28,833
- Perhaps she's sick and she doesn't-
- That's all right, Natalie.

271
00:23:44,836 --> 00:23:46,952
Goodbye.
- What?

272
00:23:47,116 --> 00:23:49,471
Hello?
This is Sunnydunes offices calling.

273
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,672
Do you know where I could reach Daria?

274
00:23:51,836 --> 00:23:54,748
No idea, I'm crashing here.
She left really early this morning.

275
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:57,032
She left? What flight did she take?

276
00:23:57,196 --> 00:23:59,869
Flight? She took my car.

277
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:02,352
You mind telling me who this is
I'm talking to?

278
00:24:02,516 --> 00:24:04,472
Yeah, I mind. Hello.

279
00:24:20,516 --> 00:24:22,666
Three million more people
in the next 10 years?

280
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,827
Standard research
shows this to be even higher.

281
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:25,985
Yes, I've heard that.

282
00:24:26,156 --> 00:24:28,954
These figures for the whole state?
Just Southern California.

283
00:24:29,116 --> 00:24:30,708
You know what that means?
What?

284
00:24:30,876 --> 00:24:32,867
That means development of at least-

285
00:24:33,036 --> 00:24:35,072
Oh, at least a quarter of a million acres.

286
00:24:35,236 --> 00:24:37,386
Yeah, well, now
our position in the market...

287
00:24:37,556 --> 00:24:41,105
...would create a capital expenditure
of 5 billion for us over a 10-year period.

288
00:24:41,276 --> 00:24:44,109
Yes, it's pretty fantastic.
We can handle that.

289
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:46,870
This doesn't consider
the state and federal expenditures...

290
00:24:47,036 --> 00:24:48,674
...cost of living index or inflation.

291
00:25:05,396 --> 00:25:08,229
Move back. Move back.

292
00:25:08,676 --> 00:25:10,587
Come on, move back.

293
00:25:15,796 --> 00:25:17,468
Split.
Get the film.

294
00:25:21,476 --> 00:25:24,229
I've got some barricaded suspects
inside the library.

295
00:25:24,396 --> 00:25:27,945
Possibly armed.
Request assistance, Code 3.

296
00:25:33,796 --> 00:25:36,594
Power to the people. Power to the people.

297
00:25:36,756 --> 00:25:38,189
Power to the people.

298
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:18,468
Clear the area around this building.

299
00:26:18,636 --> 00:26:21,434
Block off the entrance.
Everybody, back up now.

300
00:26:23,596 --> 00:26:25,314
Take it easy.

301
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:30,593
You men, come with me.

302
00:26:43,516 --> 00:26:48,192
This is Lieutenant Bell,
Metropolitan Police Department.

303
00:26:48,556 --> 00:26:52,435
You are in violation of Section 415
of the penal code.

304
00:26:52,996 --> 00:26:55,226
We know you're armed.

305
00:26:55,396 --> 00:26:59,548
If you don't throw your weapons out
immediately and give yourselves up...

306
00:26:59,716 --> 00:27:02,753
...we'll be forced to get you out
by other means.

307
00:28:15,396 --> 00:28:16,795
Get down on your stomach.

308
00:28:16,956 --> 00:28:18,912
Put yourselves down on the sidewalk.

309
00:28:20,356 --> 00:28:21,869
Face down.

310
00:28:25,156 --> 00:28:26,714
He's got a gun.

311
00:28:29,316 --> 00:28:31,876
Stay down on the sidewalk
and don't move.

312
00:28:38,556 --> 00:28:41,116
Get on the radio
and call for reinforcements.

313
00:28:41,276 --> 00:28:43,506
One-eight-five-one,
officer involved in shooting.

314
00:28:43,676 --> 00:28:46,236
Request additional help, Code 3.

315
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:11,948
Broadway and Prairie. End of the line.

316
00:29:56,996 --> 00:29:58,224
What kind of bread?

317
00:29:58,396 --> 00:29:59,795
I don't know. Hero bread.

318
00:29:59,956 --> 00:30:02,595
Make mine rye.
A lot of mayonnaise, huh?

319
00:30:15,556 --> 00:30:17,433
Hey, why so light on the meat, pop?

320
00:30:17,596 --> 00:30:18,824
I ain't on no diet.

321
00:30:18,996 --> 00:30:20,907
You want extra, you pay extra.

322
00:30:21,076 --> 00:30:22,828
We're paying, don't sweat it.

323
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,145
- Hello?
Morty?

324
00:30:25,316 --> 00:30:26,305
- Where are you?
- Tampa.

325
00:30:26,476 --> 00:30:29,149
Better cool it, somebody said
you're on TV. Was it really you?

326
00:30:29,316 --> 00:30:30,908
- What?
- On the news.

327
00:30:31,716 --> 00:30:34,788
- Are you sure?
- He said the guy looked just like you.

328
00:30:34,956 --> 00:30:36,469
Morty.

329
00:30:38,156 --> 00:30:40,670
Hello? Mark? Hello?

330
00:30:43,236 --> 00:30:45,147
Hey, can I ask a favor of you?

331
00:30:45,316 --> 00:30:46,749
Shoot.

332
00:30:49,636 --> 00:30:52,708
I was wondering if you'd trust me
for the price of a sandwich?

333
00:30:52,876 --> 00:30:54,707
Not that I don't trust you personally...

334
00:30:54,876 --> 00:30:58,266
...but if I trusted you, I'd have to trust
everybody in the whole world.

335
00:30:59,516 --> 00:31:00,995
Yeah.

336
00:34:12,196 --> 00:34:15,506
- Where do you think you're going?
- Just a little scenic flight. Wanna come?

337
00:34:15,676 --> 00:34:18,270
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

338
00:34:42,756 --> 00:34:46,032
Lilly 7, Lilly 7, Hawthorne Tower.
Abort your takeoff. Abort your takeoff.

339
00:34:46,196 --> 00:34:49,074
Traffic landing opposite direction.
Cherokee 06, Hawthorne Tower.

340
00:34:49,236 --> 00:34:50,669
Turn off as soon as safely able.

341
00:34:50,836 --> 00:34:53,873
Traffic departing opposite direction.
Lilly 7, traffic landing-

342
00:36:30,276 --> 00:36:32,949
Well, I don't know. Are we
satisfied with the cost projections?

343
00:36:33,116 --> 00:36:35,869
- Yes. Yes.
Steve can answer that.

344
00:36:36,036 --> 00:36:39,995
Yes, we funded for 200 million.
Set aside 40 against contingencies.

345
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,954
Oh, no, wait a minute.
Why tie up $40 million for contingencies?

346
00:36:43,116 --> 00:36:44,515
I mean, what contingencies?

347
00:36:44,676 --> 00:36:46,632
We found certain areas where there are...

348
00:36:46,796 --> 00:36:48,707
- ...differences in the water table.
- Hello?

349
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:51,709
Tests have shown factors...
- Hi. I'll take this in my office.

350
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:55,107
We haven't been able to figure
the cost of blasting the rock slopes.

351
00:36:55,276 --> 00:36:56,709
When will we have the figures?

352
00:36:56,876 --> 00:37:02,075
Oh, Edie. We can't make exact estimates
until phase one is 65-

353
00:37:09,076 --> 00:37:11,670
- What's up, Daria? Where are you?
I'm in some ghost town.

354
00:37:11,836 --> 00:37:14,225
I just called to say I may be a little late
in Phoenix.

355
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:15,385
Why?

356
00:37:15,556 --> 00:37:16,989
I'm looking for a little town...

357
00:37:17,156 --> 00:37:19,750
...that sounds like Glenville or Balliville
or something like that.

358
00:37:19,916 --> 00:37:21,474
Something with a "ville" in it.

359
00:37:21,636 --> 00:37:23,388
You know the desert. That ring a bell?

360
00:37:23,556 --> 00:37:26,912
A ville? Wait a minute, hold on.

361
00:37:29,516 --> 00:37:30,790
A ville.

362
00:37:30,956 --> 00:37:32,674
What do you mean? Like a Danville?

363
00:37:32,836 --> 00:37:34,633
Somewhere in the desert, man.

364
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:36,149
Danville's in Connecticut.

365
00:37:36,316 --> 00:37:38,671
Or maybe it's "hill." Something Hill.

366
00:37:38,836 --> 00:37:42,511
Hill. Hill. Why do you wanna go to a
town you don't know the name of for?

367
00:37:42,676 --> 00:37:44,155
Have you got somebody to meet?

368
00:37:44,316 --> 00:37:47,831
My friend said it's a fantastic place
for meditation.

369
00:37:48,236 --> 00:37:51,228
- What do you do on a meditation?
- You think about things.

370
00:37:51,396 --> 00:37:53,114
You think about- Daria.

371
00:37:53,276 --> 00:37:55,232
Give me the number
where you're calling from.

372
00:37:55,396 --> 00:37:57,273
I'll find out the name and call you back.

373
00:37:57,436 --> 00:38:00,428
No, you'll probably have a helicopter
sent out here to pick me up.

374
00:38:01,156 --> 00:38:04,114
- Come on, Daria.
Heh-heh.

375
00:38:04,276 --> 00:38:06,949
Thirty cents,
please, for the next three minutes.

376
00:38:07,116 --> 00:38:08,834
Just a second, operator.

377
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:11,749
Look, give me the number,
then hang up and I'll call you back.

378
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:13,395
That way, I can pay for the call.

379
00:38:13,556 --> 00:38:14,830
See you in Phoenix.

380
00:38:32,636 --> 00:38:36,185
Say, do you know of a place around here
called Glenville or Balliville...

381
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,267
...or something like that?

382
00:38:40,596 --> 00:38:42,268
Ballister?
- That's it.

383
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,390
Sure do.

384
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:48,389
- You're standing in it.
Oh, yeah?

385
00:38:48,556 --> 00:38:51,354
You didn't come here
to see one James Patterson, did you?

386
00:38:51,516 --> 00:38:53,234
How do you know?

387
00:38:53,716 --> 00:38:55,991
You look like the type.

388
00:38:56,956 --> 00:39:00,346
Well, you can tell him for me
he's gonna be the death of this town.

389
00:39:00,516 --> 00:39:02,746
He's gonna ruin
a piece of American history.

390
00:39:03,556 --> 00:39:05,148
Jimmy?

391
00:39:13,636 --> 00:39:15,547
Do you remember Johnny Wilson?

392
00:39:15,716 --> 00:39:17,115
Johnny Wilson? No.

393
00:39:17,276 --> 00:39:18,595
That's me.

394
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:21,907
I was middleweight champion
of the world in 1920.

395
00:39:22,076 --> 00:39:24,306
- Middleweight champion of the world?
- That's right.

396
00:39:24,476 --> 00:39:25,795
- That's great.
- Thank you.

397
00:39:26,996 --> 00:39:28,987
On account of being a do-gooder.

398
00:39:29,156 --> 00:39:31,272
He brought these kids out here
from Los Angeles.

399
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:33,472
Said they were sick. Emotionally sick.

400
00:39:33,636 --> 00:39:35,513
You know what that means?

401
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:38,549
But if Los Angeles don't want them,
why should we want them?

402
00:39:40,596 --> 00:39:42,552
Goddamn it.

403
00:39:46,316 --> 00:39:47,635
Goddamned criminals.

404
00:39:47,796 --> 00:39:50,151
Come around here again and I'll....

405
00:39:55,556 --> 00:39:57,945
So I guess you've seen for yourself.

406
00:39:58,116 --> 00:40:00,584
That window cost me 30 bucks.

407
00:40:19,716 --> 00:40:21,195
Hey.

408
00:40:21,476 --> 00:40:23,467
Hey, listen.

409
00:40:59,796 --> 00:41:01,354
Hey, come back.

410
00:41:01,516 --> 00:41:02,505
No.

411
00:41:26,036 --> 00:41:28,391
Hey, kid. Where's Jimmy?

412
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:21,628
Where's the man who brought you here?
Doesn't he stay with you?

413
00:42:21,796 --> 00:42:23,752
Can we have a piece of ass?

414
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,225
You'd know what to do with it?
- Yes.

415
00:42:27,316 --> 00:42:29,147
What are you doing?

416
00:42:29,556 --> 00:42:30,591
Yeah.

417
00:45:24,676 --> 00:45:26,906
Jesus Christ! Who the hell was that?

418
00:45:27,636 --> 00:45:29,354
Fuck.

419
00:45:30,916 --> 00:45:32,269
Whew.

420
00:47:34,116 --> 00:47:35,674
Ss-

421
00:47:35,836 --> 00:47:38,714
What the hell was that?

422
00:51:03,756 --> 00:51:07,431
Thanks for the nightie,
but I don't think I can use it.

423
00:51:08,036 --> 00:51:10,027
How come? Wrong color?

424
00:51:10,196 --> 00:51:11,868
Wrong sex. Heh-heh.

425
00:51:30,356 --> 00:51:32,631
Which way you headed?
- Phoenix.

426
00:51:32,796 --> 00:51:35,629
Phoenix? What for?
There's nothing in Phoenix.

427
00:51:36,916 --> 00:51:39,635
Look, I'm in a little trouble here...

428
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:41,991
...and since you've come along
with a car...

429
00:51:42,156 --> 00:51:44,192
...give me a lift
so I can get some more gas.

430
00:51:44,356 --> 00:51:46,790
- How far?
- I don't know.

431
00:51:46,956 --> 00:51:49,516
This gentleman says maybe 20 miles.

432
00:51:49,676 --> 00:51:51,234
Okay.

433
00:51:57,476 --> 00:52:01,469
The radio said somebody stole a plane
in L.A. this morning.

434
00:52:03,156 --> 00:52:05,909
Did you really steal that thing?
How come?

435
00:52:06,076 --> 00:52:08,351
I needed to get off the ground.

436
00:53:24,716 --> 00:53:26,593
Stop it.

437
00:54:06,156 --> 00:54:11,628
"This is an area of ancient lake beds
deposited 5 to 10 million years ago.

438
00:54:12,196 --> 00:54:15,552
These beds have been tilted
and pushed upward by earth forces...

439
00:54:15,716 --> 00:54:17,707
...and eroded by wind and water.

440
00:54:17,876 --> 00:54:19,707
They contain borates and gypsum."

441
00:54:20,276 --> 00:54:21,504
Borates and gypsum?

442
00:54:21,676 --> 00:54:24,349
Two old prospectors who lost their way.

443
00:54:46,145 --> 00:54:47,942
How do these plants
make it in the sand?

444
00:54:48,105 --> 00:54:49,902
They're so beautiful.

445
00:54:54,385 --> 00:54:56,694
What do you do besides fly airplanes?

446
00:54:56,865 --> 00:54:59,504
Until yesterday,
I drove a forklift truck at a warehouse.

447
00:54:59,665 --> 00:55:00,859
Done other things.

448
00:55:01,025 --> 00:55:02,936
- Been to college?
- Some.

449
00:55:03,105 --> 00:55:05,665
Why did you leave? Grades?

450
00:55:05,825 --> 00:55:07,577
Extra-curricular activities.

451
00:55:07,745 --> 00:55:08,860
Like what?

452
00:55:09,025 --> 00:55:11,539
Like stealing hardcover books
instead of paperbacks.

453
00:55:11,705 --> 00:55:14,617
Making phone calls on the chancellor's
stolen credit-card number...

454
00:55:14,785 --> 00:55:16,616
...whistling in class.

455
00:55:17,505 --> 00:55:21,020
And bringing illegal things on the campus
like a dog, a bike, a woman.

456
00:55:21,185 --> 00:55:23,176
What's wrong with that?

457
00:55:24,785 --> 00:55:27,094
- We did it in the road.
- Ha-ha-ha.

458
00:55:27,585 --> 00:55:30,543
They finally kicked me out
after I broke into the dean's office...

459
00:55:30,705 --> 00:55:32,900
...and reprogrammed the computer.

460
00:55:33,305 --> 00:55:34,579
Put them uptight.

461
00:55:35,825 --> 00:55:38,385
You know why?
I made all the engineers take art courses.

462
00:55:41,305 --> 00:55:43,535
- She's gonna follow me down.
- Okay.

463
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:47,659
Oh!

464
00:55:47,945 --> 00:55:50,300
So tell me the rest
of your criminal record.

465
00:55:50,465 --> 00:55:54,424
Once I changed my color,
but it didn't work, so I changed back.

466
00:55:59,745 --> 00:56:03,294
Did you hear that the Mexican air force
is bombing the grass along the border?

467
00:56:03,465 --> 00:56:06,298
I wonder what else is going on
in the real world.

468
00:56:07,105 --> 00:56:08,504
Hear any news about the strike?

469
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:11,304
Not much. I prefer music.

470
00:56:11,465 --> 00:56:15,060
It's like they don't even report it unless
two- or three-hundred people get hurt.

471
00:56:15,225 --> 00:56:16,783
Yeah, some kind of record.

472
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:18,780
Or a cop.

473
00:56:18,945 --> 00:56:22,858
Oh, a cop did get killed
and some bushes were trampled.

474
00:56:23,025 --> 00:56:25,778
I was trying to find a rock station.

475
00:56:26,065 --> 00:56:28,704
I think they said the guy
who killed the cop was white.

476
00:56:28,865 --> 00:56:30,901
Oh, white man taking up arms
for the blacks, huh?

477
00:56:32,225 --> 00:56:34,216
Just like old John Brown.

478
00:56:44,065 --> 00:56:46,135
Wanna go down by that riverbed?

479
00:56:49,665 --> 00:56:52,054
See you at the bottom.
- Wait a minute.

480
00:56:57,665 --> 00:56:59,223
Whoo!

481
00:57:18,545 --> 00:57:21,617
Hey. Hey, whatever-your-name-is.

482
00:57:22,265 --> 00:57:24,335
Hey, tough guy.

483
00:57:25,345 --> 00:57:26,937
Are you all right?

484
00:58:01,105 --> 00:58:02,618
Want some smoke?

485
00:58:02,785 --> 00:58:05,219
You know you're talking to a guy
who's under discipline.

486
00:58:05,385 --> 00:58:06,738
What's that?

487
00:58:07,305 --> 00:58:08,420
A joke, I guess...

488
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:12,021
...but this group I was in
had rules about smoking.

489
00:58:12,185 --> 00:58:14,699
They're on a "reality trip."

490
00:58:14,865 --> 00:58:16,935
Hmp. What a drag.

491
00:58:17,705 --> 00:58:19,775
Let's go find some shade.

492
00:58:43,705 --> 00:58:45,343
What do you mean, reality trip?

493
00:58:45,505 --> 00:58:48,542
Oh, yeah, they can't imagine things.

494
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:51,664
Were you in with that group?
Why didn't you get out?

495
00:58:51,825 --> 00:58:53,656
I wasn't really in the group.

496
00:58:53,825 --> 00:58:57,340
I just couldn't stand their bullshit talk.
Really bored the hell out of me.

497
00:58:57,505 --> 00:59:00,542
But when it gets down to it,
you'd have to choose one side.

498
00:59:00,705 --> 00:59:03,299
There's a thousand sides,
not just heroes and villains.

499
00:59:03,465 --> 00:59:04,580
Stow that rap.

500
00:59:04,745 --> 00:59:06,417
- What's your name?
- Daria.

501
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:10,419
Point is, if you don't see them
as villains, you can't get rid of them.

502
00:59:12,225 --> 00:59:15,217
You think if you can get rid of them,
we'll have a whole new scene?

503
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:18,297
Why not? Can you think of
any other way we can go about it?

504
00:59:18,465 --> 00:59:21,025
Who's we? Your group?

505
00:59:21,185 --> 00:59:22,174
You and me, babe.

506
00:59:23,625 --> 00:59:24,944
You and me?

507
00:59:38,705 --> 00:59:40,980
Don't you feel at home here?

508
00:59:44,185 --> 00:59:45,982
It's peaceful.

509
00:59:47,345 --> 00:59:48,937
It's dead.

510
00:59:52,065 --> 00:59:54,625
Okay, it's dead.

511
00:59:54,785 --> 00:59:56,855
So let's play a death game.

512
00:59:58,665 --> 01:00:02,453
You start at one end of the valley
and I'll start at the other.

513
01:00:02,625 --> 01:00:04,934
And we'll see who can kill the most.

514
01:00:05,105 --> 01:00:09,815
We'll start on lizards and snakes
and then move up to mice and rabbits.

515
01:00:10,985 --> 01:00:14,580
At the end, we'll count up
how many deaths each of us has.

516
01:00:14,745 --> 01:00:17,179
And the winner will get to kill the loser.

517
01:00:17,345 --> 01:00:20,382
Did I make a mistake?
You don't wanna play that game?

518
01:00:20,545 --> 01:00:22,820
I don't wanna play any games at all.

519
01:00:31,265 --> 01:00:33,859
It was nice of you to come with a guy
that doesn't turn on.

520
01:00:34,025 --> 01:00:35,743
I'm pretty tolerant.

521
01:00:35,905 --> 01:00:38,021
What are you doing here?
Phoenix, was that real?

522
01:00:38,185 --> 01:00:41,097
My boss wants me there.
Some conference.

523
01:00:41,265 --> 01:00:42,459
You are pretty tolerant.

524
01:01:03,985 --> 01:01:06,453
Pretend your thoughts are like plants.

525
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:08,104
Okay.

526
01:01:08,505 --> 01:01:11,861
What do you see?
Neat rows, like a garden?

527
01:01:12,025 --> 01:01:16,382
Or wild things,
like ferns and weeds and vines?

528
01:01:17,665 --> 01:01:19,735
I see sort of a jungle.

529
01:01:21,625 --> 01:01:24,537
It'd be nice if they could plant thoughts
in our heads...

530
01:01:24,705 --> 01:01:27,299
...so nobody would have bad memories.

531
01:01:27,665 --> 01:01:32,693
They could plant, you know,
wonderful things you did...

532
01:01:32,865 --> 01:01:37,541
...like a happy childhood,
real groovy parents...

533
01:01:37,705 --> 01:01:38,899
...only good things.

534
01:01:39,065 --> 01:01:41,135
Yeah, to make you forget
how terrible it was.

535
01:01:41,305 --> 01:01:44,058
That's the point, nothing's terrible.

536
01:01:45,865 --> 01:01:46,934
Far out.

537
01:01:59,585 --> 01:02:02,179
Sometimes I feel like
screaming my head off.

538
01:02:02,345 --> 01:02:04,984
Well, now's your chance.
Go ahead. There's nobody around.

539
01:02:05,145 --> 01:02:07,534
Look, no man's land. Nothing.

540
01:02:07,705 --> 01:02:08,694
But someone-
- Who?

541
01:02:08,865 --> 01:02:11,538
A ghost? A dead pioneer?

542
01:02:12,225 --> 01:02:15,183
Hoo! Hoo-hoo!

543
01:02:20,345 --> 01:02:22,222
Wee-hoo!

544
01:02:26,425 --> 01:02:30,941
Aaaah!

545
01:02:53,865 --> 01:02:55,901
Whoa! Ha-ha-ha!

546
01:03:02,625 --> 01:03:04,422
So anyway....

547
01:03:06,025 --> 01:03:07,617
So anyway....

548
01:03:07,785 --> 01:03:09,104
What?

549
01:03:09,625 --> 01:03:12,139
"So anyway" ought to be one word.

550
01:03:12,425 --> 01:03:15,497
The name of some place or a river.

551
01:03:15,665 --> 01:03:17,621
"Soanyway River."

552
01:03:30,065 --> 01:03:31,418
Hey.

553
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:35,058
- All that's left of that poor old prospector.
- Hmm.

554
01:03:35,225 --> 01:03:36,783
- Borates?
- Mm-hm.

555
01:03:50,425 --> 01:03:52,063
Is that gypsum?

556
01:03:52,225 --> 01:03:53,340
Well, it ain't table salt.

557
01:04:05,105 --> 01:04:06,584
Would you like to go with me?

558
01:04:06,745 --> 01:04:07,894
Where?

559
01:04:08,065 --> 01:04:09,896
Wherever I'm going.

560
01:04:10,065 --> 01:04:12,101
Are you really asking?

561
01:04:12,705 --> 01:04:13,979
Is that your real answer?

562
01:04:49,985 --> 01:04:51,100
You can't do that.

563
01:04:51,265 --> 01:04:53,904
Oh, of course not.
You're not the boss of me.

564
01:04:57,745 --> 01:04:59,337
Take your clothes off.

565
01:12:05,225 --> 01:12:07,261
I always knew it'd be like this.

566
01:12:07,425 --> 01:12:08,540
Us?

567
01:12:08,705 --> 01:12:10,297
The desert.

568
01:12:50,305 --> 01:12:53,695
Oh, they should build a drive-in up here.
Ha. They'd make a mint.

569
01:12:53,865 --> 01:12:55,776
- Why don't you do it?
- Me?

570
01:12:55,945 --> 01:12:58,778
Oh. Ha-ha. No.

571
01:13:55,585 --> 01:13:57,223
That'd be something else.

572
01:14:21,585 --> 01:14:22,574
Having trouble?

573
01:14:22,745 --> 01:14:25,657
Oh, no.
I was just going to the bathroom.

574
01:14:26,265 --> 01:14:27,414
Where's your car?

575
01:14:27,825 --> 01:14:31,135
I left it along with my driver's license,
BankAmericard...

576
01:14:31,305 --> 01:14:35,935
...traveler's checks, social security
number, birth certificate and....

577
01:15:36,745 --> 01:15:38,303
Bye.

578
01:15:52,185 --> 01:15:54,255
Man, you're really crazy.

579
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:56,063
Is it loaded?

580
01:15:56,705 --> 01:15:58,104
No.

581
01:16:03,065 --> 01:16:05,021
Digging for water?

582
01:16:05,345 --> 01:16:07,097
I'm gonna bury it.

583
01:16:09,225 --> 01:16:11,898
Why did you ask me about the strike?
Were you there?

584
01:16:12,065 --> 01:16:13,339
Yeah.

585
01:16:13,505 --> 01:16:15,655
The guy who killed the cop....

586
01:16:22,625 --> 01:16:25,901
No. I wanted to,
but somebody else was there.

587
01:16:26,065 --> 01:16:28,135
- But they said that-
- They? Who's they?

588
01:16:28,305 --> 01:16:29,624
On the radio.

589
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:31,821
I never got off a shot.

590
01:16:35,585 --> 01:16:38,861
You'll need them. You're gonna have
a hard time making them believe you.

591
01:16:39,025 --> 01:16:40,663
I ain't gonna try.

592
01:16:40,825 --> 01:16:43,703
Why? I believe you.

593
01:16:49,625 --> 01:16:51,820
Let's go back to the car.

594
01:16:52,905 --> 01:16:54,020
We can drive out of here.

595
01:16:54,185 --> 01:16:56,574
If you cut your hair,
they'd never recognize you.

596
01:16:56,745 --> 01:16:58,736
Do I need a haircut?

597
01:17:05,825 --> 01:17:08,623
No, you look beautiful.

598
01:17:20,385 --> 01:17:22,615
They might not even think it's a plane.

599
01:17:22,785 --> 01:17:26,903
Strange prehistoric bird spotted
over Mojave Desert with its genitals out.

600
01:17:31,185 --> 01:17:34,461
You are just crazy enough
to take this thing back to L.A.

601
01:17:34,625 --> 01:17:35,740
Sure.

602
01:17:35,905 --> 01:17:37,975
You don't borrow
someone's private plane...

603
01:17:38,145 --> 01:17:41,854
...take it for a joyride, and never
come back to express your thanks.

604
01:17:47,265 --> 01:17:50,735
It's nice to see a young man
who shows some respect.

605
01:18:04,265 --> 01:18:07,143
- That's a great thing, man.
- Sure is.

606
01:18:09,345 --> 01:18:11,779
Do you really think you have a chance?

607
01:18:12,225 --> 01:18:15,695
I'll set it down far enough from
the tower so I can make it into this field.

608
01:18:15,865 --> 01:18:18,902
From there, I got it made. Back
before they know what's happening.

609
01:18:19,065 --> 01:18:20,783
But why take it back?

610
01:18:20,945 --> 01:18:23,061
Just ditch it here
and ride with me to Phoenix.

611
01:18:23,225 --> 01:18:26,297
- You don't have to take the risk of-
- I wanna take risks.

612
01:18:31,225 --> 01:18:33,978
Well, isn't she beautiful?

613
01:18:34,225 --> 01:18:35,658
Yeah.

614
01:19:52,385 --> 01:19:55,024
Did you use the plane very often, sir?

615
01:19:55,185 --> 01:19:56,334
Yes.

616
01:19:56,505 --> 01:19:58,302
Was it insured for liability and theft?

617
01:19:58,465 --> 01:20:00,342
Of course it was.
It was a small plane...

618
01:20:00,505 --> 01:20:02,621
...but they don't come cheap,
I can tell you.

619
01:20:02,785 --> 01:20:04,503
My wife was in love with that thing.

620
01:20:04,665 --> 01:20:06,940
In fact, I had it painted
her favorite color: Pink.

621
01:20:12,225 --> 01:20:13,817
So you actually talked with the kid?

622
01:20:13,985 --> 01:20:16,340
- Yeah, I talked with him.
- What did he say?

623
01:20:17,065 --> 01:20:18,896
He asked me if he could go for a ride.

624
01:20:19,065 --> 01:20:20,976
He acted like it was his plane.

625
01:20:21,145 --> 01:20:22,942
And you believed him?

626
01:20:24,745 --> 01:20:25,814
No.

627
01:20:26,265 --> 01:20:27,744
Then why did you let him go?

628
01:20:27,905 --> 01:20:28,894
Oh, I don't know.

629
01:20:29,065 --> 01:20:32,819
- Do you remember what he was wearing?
- Yeah, he had on a shirt and dark hair.

630
01:20:32,985 --> 01:20:34,816
About how old would you say he was?

631
01:20:34,985 --> 01:20:36,623
Oh, about 30, I guess.

632
01:20:36,785 --> 01:20:39,345
Or maybe younger. Twenty, 21?

633
01:22:29,345 --> 01:22:30,619
The Four-H Club...

634
01:22:30,785 --> 01:22:32,821
...is sponsoring a rodeo
in Kakoak Sunday afternoon...

635
01:22:32,985 --> 01:22:34,179
...at the Shepper High stadium.

636
01:22:34,345 --> 01:22:36,734
There will be lots of horses
and dusty fun for all.

637
01:22:36,905 --> 01:22:38,816
And cotton candy too, I'll bet, huh.

638
01:24:01,345 --> 01:24:04,337
This kid's gotta be out of his head
just to bring it back.

639
01:24:46,225 --> 01:24:48,455
Cherokee 06, you're cleared to land.

640
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:49,614
Cherokee 5-Niner-

641
01:24:49,785 --> 01:24:52,777
Tower has just spotted Lilly 7
coming in for a landing.

642
01:24:52,945 --> 01:24:54,697
He's nearing the pattern now
from the south.

643
01:24:56,865 --> 01:24:58,378
Roger.

644
01:25:06,145 --> 01:25:09,023
That's a big no.
Incoming traffic's in a holding pattern.

645
01:25:15,105 --> 01:25:19,701
KHT 759, this is KHT 652.
Come in, please.

646
01:25:19,865 --> 01:25:23,574
KHT 652, this is KHT 759.

647
01:25:23,745 --> 01:25:25,975
You should see this thing.
You wouldn't believe it.

648
01:25:26,145 --> 01:25:27,544
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

649
01:25:27,705 --> 01:25:29,900
It's got all those funny jokes
painted over it.

650
01:28:53,585 --> 01:28:55,382
Call an ambulance.

651
01:28:55,625 --> 01:28:57,581
Get a tire iron from the car.

652
01:29:12,945 --> 01:29:14,139
- all airliners.

653
01:29:14,305 --> 01:29:17,297
An apparent hijacking attempt
has ended with one youth dead.

654
01:29:17,465 --> 01:29:20,935
After repeated attempts by the police
to block the plane without success...

655
01:29:21,105 --> 01:29:24,859
...several shots were fired into the
cockpit by an unidentified police officer...

656
01:29:25,025 --> 01:29:27,937
...killing the youth immediately.
Stay tuned for full details...

657
01:29:28,105 --> 01:29:30,255
...as they are received
at Keynox News Central.

658
01:29:30,425 --> 01:29:32,222
We turn you now to John Faney.

659
01:32:26,025 --> 01:32:28,585
Oh, what was it like anyway?

660
01:32:28,745 --> 01:32:29,734
Don't ask her.

661
01:32:29,905 --> 01:32:30,940
Don't ask.
- What?

662
01:32:34,065 --> 01:32:35,384
I wonder, yes.

663
01:32:36,945 --> 01:32:39,334
Oh, someone would call.

664
01:32:43,585 --> 01:32:45,974
Bye-bye.
Well, he's coming right now.

665
01:32:46,785 --> 01:32:47,900
Oh, yes, yes.

666
01:32:48,065 --> 01:32:51,102
He's gonna tell us everything
that happened the other night.

667
01:32:51,265 --> 01:32:52,493
I can find a place for that.

668
01:32:52,665 --> 01:32:53,654
- Yes.
- Light your own.

669
01:32:54,985 --> 01:32:58,341
Very interesting.
Nicky, you know, said she wasn't there.

670
01:32:58,785 --> 01:33:00,184
But I walked out by the pool.

671
01:34:32,745 --> 01:34:36,055
Well, Lee,
if these are your final conditions...

672
01:34:36,225 --> 01:34:39,581
...I don't see how I can
possibly submit them to our associates.

673
01:34:39,745 --> 01:34:42,418
This proposal is just unacceptable.

674
01:34:42,585 --> 01:34:46,464
You know as well as I do that the price
of anything is never high or low...

675
01:34:46,625 --> 01:34:49,742
...except in relation to
its potential use, right?

676
01:34:49,905 --> 01:34:54,615
Well, the only question for you is, is
this land of value to your people or not?

677
01:34:55,425 --> 01:34:58,258
Frankly, I don't think that it is.

678
01:34:58,425 --> 01:35:01,815
We don't wanna get in over our heads
any more than you people do.

679
01:35:04,705 --> 01:35:06,138
Mm-hm.

680
01:35:48,385 --> 01:35:50,296
He talked about potential use.

681
01:35:50,465 --> 01:35:51,580
This is speculation.

682
01:35:51,745 --> 01:35:54,942
We shouldn't pay any more
than speculation prices.

683
01:36:03,105 --> 01:36:06,142
What do you think, counselor?
Shall we call their bluff?

684
01:36:19,905 --> 01:36:21,782
How are you, Jack?

685
01:36:32,705 --> 01:36:34,104
Daria?

686
01:36:37,225 --> 01:36:38,499
Hey.

687
01:36:40,025 --> 01:36:43,984
Well, what-? What happened to you?
Did you try and go swimming?

688
01:36:44,825 --> 01:36:47,737
Anyway, you arrived finally.
That's the important thing.

689
01:36:47,905 --> 01:36:51,102
Now, listen.
Go downstairs, change clothes.

690
01:36:51,265 --> 01:36:54,894
Your room is the first on the right
at the bottom of the stairs, okay?

691
01:39:20,345 --> 01:39:24,736
Now we realize it's got great potential,
with the marina, with the pier, et cetera.

692
01:39:24,905 --> 01:39:28,295
It blends itself with casual living
and yet it's affluent.

693
01:39:28,465 --> 01:39:31,662
As a matter of fact,
I'm quite enthusiastic about this project.

694
01:39:31,825 --> 01:39:34,783
But the next thing you know
we'll be finding gold on this property.

695
01:39:34,945 --> 01:39:38,017
So if we find water there,
we can certainly find gold.

696
01:39:38,185 --> 01:39:40,062
Well, in this country, water is gold.

697
01:39:40,225 --> 01:39:42,056
Development of an airstrip or roads.

698
01:39:42,625 --> 01:39:45,059
The marina development
and the shore areas...

699
01:39:45,225 --> 01:39:49,776
...would, of course, be a subsequent
facet of the entire project.
