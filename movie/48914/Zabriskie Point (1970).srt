1
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,600
It's always the same story,
it's been going on for 300 years; if you are so clever,

2
00:02:59,635 --> 00:03:01,900
why didn't you come on our side
right from the beginning?

3
00:03:01,935 --> 00:03:03,965
Now can't do anything else
other than going there

4
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,300
and telling them "we are really sorry"
but the university is closed, on strike,

5
00:03:06,335 --> 00:03:08,500
we'll blow a whistle when it's over

6
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,900
What do you think about boycotting the
recruitment of militaries at the university?

7
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,100
There is only one thing to do:
to go in the recruitment offices,

8
00:03:18,135 --> 00:03:21,500
to take a bottle, to fill it with petrol,
to cork the bottle...

9
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,100
Oh yes,

10
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,065
but what if we want to blow
up sociology instead?

11
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,400
You, listen to me, a molotov is a
mix of petrol and kerosene,

12
00:03:29,435 --> 00:03:32,700
a radical white man
is a mix of chat and shit

13
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,000
Listen to me, I'm not here to show you
my revolutionary credentials,

14
00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:44,000
but there are a lot of white students
fighting on the street,

15
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,565
just as you do in the ghetto,

16
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,100
and there are a lot of unsatisfied white
people who are potentially revolutionary

17
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,665
Here we do again the same talk, guys

18
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,100
When they fly you in jail
because of a bit of marijuana,

19
00:03:57,135 --> 00:03:59,200
then you become revolutionary

20
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,700
But it's when they smash your face in,
when they break your head down

21
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,800
when they prevent you to go to school,
to get a job,

22
00:04:05,835 --> 00:04:08,065
then you have to become revolutionary

23
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,465
That's why you people say that we
negros are living in another...

24
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,700
Wait a moment. You are talking to white
students. I think we understand

25
00:04:16,735 --> 00:04:20,200
yes, a lot of us understand what
makes negros revolutionary,

26
00:04:20,235 --> 00:04:21,565
but what makes white people revolutionary?

27
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,500
The same fucking thing that
makes negros revolutionary

28
00:04:24,535 --> 00:04:26,665
But it doesn't happen the same way

29
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,900
It will happen, don't worry,
you don't need to do anything to make it happen,

30
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:32,065
you can prevent it, sure, you can break it off,

31
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,800
you can do everything but you can't...
- For example?

32
00:04:34,835 --> 00:04:37,465
This country is falling into Fascism,
can't you see?

33
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,800
I mean, now we have the police in
the university, and then? Where do you want them?

34
00:04:40,835 --> 00:04:43,265
Sitting with us in the class?
And then inside our homes? And then?

35
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,900
On the road, when you go out? Are you
waiting for this to become revolutionary?

36
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,300
What I mean is that we should
close the university, that's it,

37
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:55,465
and nobody, nobody should get up our nose,

38
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,065
and if they do,
it will be at their own risk and danger

39
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,100
and when they'll decide to reopen it,
they will do it on our conditions

40
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,365
But why stopping the people who want
to go to the lessons? Why...

41
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,400
Because they are against us,
because they prevent us to get what we deserve

42
00:05:07,435 --> 00:05:11,100
we've tried everything: we've begged,
negotiated, written programs,

43
00:05:11,135 --> 00:05:12,900
but we haven't got a damn.

44
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,865
I think, and I'm not the only one,

45
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,900
everybody knows that the main
point of every kind of guerrilla

46
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,700
is that the enemy is invisible, things happen,
and they don't know how and where

47
00:05:28,735 --> 00:05:32,017
People who act to get the attention
on themselves,

48
00:05:32,052 --> 00:05:34,726
do it on purpose
just to divert it from others

49
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:37,400
I don't think, we have reached this point yet:

50
00:05:37,435 --> 00:05:39,465
we've just begun to involve people

51
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,565
If you want to close the university,
what do you want to...

52
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,800
- We don't even have the support of white people...
- Hey listen to me!

53
00:05:43,835 --> 00:05:46,665
- We need mass demonstrations.
- Just a moment!

54
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,800
The side of the black students
doesn't want to give a show

55
00:05:49,835 --> 00:05:51,300
We just close the university and that's it

56
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,565
Speaking of what you say,
I don't agree, you know,

57
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,100
I mean about the help from white people,
I mean, It doesn't matter so much

58
00:05:59,135 --> 00:06:01,500
because if tomorrow our agitation
is successful,

59
00:06:01,535 --> 00:06:04,665
it's going to be that every student,

60
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,900
in or out of the demonstration, black or white,
will be considered an enemy,

61
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:10,717
and it will be easier to keep the tension

62
00:06:10,752 --> 00:06:13,500
that we, all together, became a public threat

63
00:06:13,535 --> 00:06:15,500
Well then I share your opinion

64
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,400
There is no more coffee.
Can you make some more?

65
00:06:18,435 --> 00:06:22,000
Isn't there any man who can make coffee?

66
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,200
- Now let's listen to you. - I suggest that we form
some groups of 4 or 5 of us,

67
00:06:27,235 --> 00:06:30,000
that should stay out of the university
and that, at some given moment,

68
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:31,700
should move behind the police

69
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,765
- Please! - Yes I mean as distracting tactics,

70
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,800
- so the others could have time to reach...
- Just a moment!

71
00:06:38,835 --> 00:06:40,867
Are cars good to build barricades?

72
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:42,900
- Cars? - Inside the university?

73
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,200
- As tactics to...
- why don't you bring here your own?

74
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,900
It's a sport car, is it ok? Take it here,
then I'll take care of it

75
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,500
Is it possible that you don't
understand that until...

76
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,500
- Silence! - There's only one way to talk
with the white men,

77
00:07:12,535 --> 00:07:14,465
and that's in their own language

78
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,300
if they talk with weapons,
you answer with weapons, it's very easy

79
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,800
- But are you ready to die?
- Many black men already died,

80
00:07:21,835 --> 00:07:24,265
and many others are now dying in this country;

81
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,400
if we are on the top of the movement,
it's because we pay personally.

82
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,700
- I'm also ready to die.
- Alone?

83
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,900
But not of boredom

84
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,965
Who the hell is he?

85
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
No no, it's alright, he lives with me.

86
00:07:44,035 --> 00:07:45,965
Maybe meetings aren't his forte

87
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,665
Sorry, but if it wasn't to join us,
why did he come?

88
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,200
Why? Who has the right to say if he
wants to stay here or not?

89
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,965
What kind of bullshit is that

90
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,300
if he wants to be a revolutionary he has
to stay with other people, otherwise...

91
00:07:58,335 --> 00:07:59,665
That's why he came here

92
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,765
There is no revolutionary without other people,

93
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,400
who was Lenin with no organization,
or Castro with no organization,

94
00:08:05,435 --> 00:08:09,200
even anarchists spent their
life in meetings, what the hell

95
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,565
Tell that guy to start reading the
Little Red Book, the first page,

96
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,400
where it says that the revolution cannot
break out anywhere without a revolutionary party

97
00:08:17,435 --> 00:08:21,200
and that if he goes on with his middle-class individualism,
he'll lose his life.

98
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:23,400
To the end against
the middle-class individualism!

99
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,000
There was an open door on the third
floor, now it's ok.

100
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,000
Is it allowed to go on the roof?

101
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,200
I mean, do you let me go up?

102
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,765
Regulation

103
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,600
I have to take a book,
I forgot it upstairs at lunchtime.

104
00:08:44,635 --> 00:08:47,265
Which book?
Why don't you eat at the cafeteria?

105
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,400
- How was your holiday?
- Well, we'll meet us later.

106
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,500
Who can give me the permission?

107
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,300
- Good evening mister Allen.
- Good evening Tom.

108
00:09:09,335 --> 00:09:10,900
Did you stay up late today?

109
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,900
Yes, I had to work.

110
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,165
May I help you?

111
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,600
Well, I hope. I replaced a secretary today,

112
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,900
I went up at lunchtime

113
00:09:24,935 --> 00:09:27,765
and I forgot... - A book.

114
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,300
- Are you a secretary?
- Actually I don't like it,

115
00:09:31,335 --> 00:09:34,200
I work only when I need it.

116
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,100
Who's that girl?

117
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,000
- A girl from my past past.
- What's her name?

118
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,300
Alice.

119
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,900
My sister.

120
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,300
What's that stuff?

121
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,600
It's a form: in case of roundup,
they release you sooner

122
00:12:00,635 --> 00:12:01,900
if you give it to them already filled up.

123
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,500
"Always ready", don't you have another slogan?

124
00:12:04,535 --> 00:12:05,865
You have to be realist.

125
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,100
Listen up, the day you'll
decide not to resign yourselves,

126
00:12:08,135 --> 00:12:09,400
I'll enter the movement

127
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,400
A lot a people cannot chose,
for many it's a question of survival.

128
00:12:13,435 --> 00:12:14,565
That's what I mean.

129
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,000
- What?
- Really. I'm not joking.

130
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,750
I'm sick of this, young people talk about
violence, and the police does it.

131
00:12:25,785 --> 00:12:28,500
Have you seen that idiot today who said
that one should do something...

132
00:12:28,535 --> 00:12:31,300
...only when it's needed?
Well, I need it before.

133
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,400
Anyway, the demonstration will be
in front of the rectorship all day.

134
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,900
Well, alright.

135
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,900
Here check 1 to surveillance 1AL51.
It's enough for today.

136
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,900
Surveillance to 1AL51.
Break.

137
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,465
What do you want?

138
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,300
A friend of mine was arrested today.

139
00:13:17,335 --> 00:13:19,100
I'd like to know if he's been released.

140
00:13:19,135 --> 00:13:20,565
- One of the students? - Yes.

141
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,600
They are recording them.
It takes some time.

142
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,165
Sit down.

143
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,700
Does it take a lot?
- 5 minutes. Or 5 hours.

144
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Thanks

145
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,100
Empty your pockets.

146
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,500
- Name? - George S. Tolli.

147
00:13:58,535 --> 00:13:59,800
Put your hands above.

148
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,700
- Tolli? - T.O.L.L.I.

149
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,500
- No more names? A nickname?
- No.

150
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,100
Take away your glasses.

151
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,300
- Address?
- 1152 Stock.

152
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,500
- City? - AHA.

153
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,100
- Employment?
- History teacher on annual contract

154
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:34,500
It's too long George: let's write office-worker

155
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,800
- Money in the wallet?
- Two dollars.

156
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,700
Some of these boys need to be treated

157
00:14:45,735 --> 00:14:48,200
You didn’t say that you're also a doctor?

158
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,400
- And who are you?
- There's a friend of mine here,

159
00:15:30,435 --> 00:15:31,765
I came to pay the bail

160
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,465
You are not allowed to stay there,
off with you

161
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,165
I thought that when someone
comes to pay the bail...

162
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,000
You thought? Did you think
that the regulation was not for you?

163
00:15:38,035 --> 00:15:40,600
Did you think you're someone special?
Off with you

164
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:42,600
Hey Martin, do you need something?

165
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,600
Here you are, now you can meet your friend

166
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,650
Hands up

167
00:15:58,685 --> 00:16:00,500
What a day!

168
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,100
- Name?
- Karl Marx

169
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,900
How do you write it?

170
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,600
M.A.R.X.

171
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,500
Goodbye

172
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,800
- So? What do you want?
- We'd need some weapons. Self defense.

173
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:44,017
So, this is the law:
you buy the weapons now

174
00:16:44,052 --> 00:16:46,626
and I verify your criminal record in Sacramento

175
00:16:46,661 --> 00:16:49,165
In 4 or 5 days
you can come here to get them

176
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,400
The law is valid in time of peace.
This is an emergency.

177
00:16:52,435 --> 00:16:54,665
We live in a neighborhood close to...

178
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,100
you understand me...
We have to defend our women

179
00:16:58,135 --> 00:17:00,617
You're right, for God's sake,
you're right.

180
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:03,626
I won't let you go
with nothing in your hands

181
00:17:03,661 --> 00:17:06,600
In my opinion,
you need at least a caliber 38

182
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,700
Hey boys,

183
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,450
the law accords you the right
to defend your homes:

184
00:17:18,485 --> 00:17:21,300
if you shoot them in the garden,
then drag them indoor

185
00:17:21,335 --> 00:17:22,517
Ok

186
00:17:22,552 --> 00:17:23,700
Thanks

187
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,865
The joy of a beautiful holiday out in the open

188
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,300
The sun of the desert
shining on your swimming-pool

189
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,865
Why breathing the infected air of the city

190
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,400
if you can enjoy your life
with "Sunny Dunes Relax"

191
00:17:46,435 --> 00:17:48,865
Playing tennis on the emerald grass,

192
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,800
walking in the open
in the middle of the desert

193
00:17:51,835 --> 00:17:55,000
taking your kid hunting on wild walks

194
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,800
You could even
spot the mountain lion

195
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,400
Sun, fresh air,
good water in your garden

196
00:18:04,435 --> 00:18:06,165
Become an independent man,

197
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,265
a pioneer's life
in the West's endless horizon

198
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,650
And for you ladies,
a completely furnitured kitchen,

199
00:18:12,685 --> 00:18:16,000
for the happiness of your husband
and your child

200
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,265
And don't forget the pleasure
of a golf game

201
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,700
in the golf court that
Sunny Dunes has prepared for you

202
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:24,965
Nine holes on a fabulous background

203
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,200
What are you waiting for to leave that
crowded madhouse that's the city?

204
00:18:29,235 --> 00:18:33,400
Move here today, for a new life in
the healthy climate of the desert

205
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,300
Are you getting into aerial acrobatics, Bob?

206
00:18:36,335 --> 00:18:38,667
No, Jane, I'm just flying over the desert

207
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:41,301
to look for our new home for the holidays

208
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:43,900
Finding it it's easy,
just call 84868

209
00:18:43,935 --> 00:18:45,165
Can you repeat the number, Bob?

210
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,900
Of course: Sunny Dunes Land Development Company,
Box 82, Los Angeles, California

211
00:18:49,935 --> 00:18:52,965
News from inland:
today the works for the new highway

212
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,500
that connects the hills to the city
of Los Angeles have finished

213
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:58,417
50.000 citizens had to move
because of the works,

214
00:18:58,452 --> 00:19:01,265
and the houses on the route had been
knocked down.

215
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,300
These are the data provided
by the building department

216
00:19:04,335 --> 00:19:07,265
Vietnam: American soldiers who
died on the Vietnamese front

217
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,700
are nearly 50.000 according to last
data coming from the Pentagon

218
00:19:09,735 --> 00:19:12,067
The number of soldiers being
cured in military hospitals

219
00:19:12,102 --> 00:19:14,400
wasn't notified. Caporal Darry
Marshall from our city

220
00:19:14,435 --> 00:19:16,500
died on the battlefield a week ago

221
00:19:16,535 --> 00:19:18,500
- Did you see here?
- What?

222
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,300
we've got 7 multimillionaires
at this time.

223
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,100
We who?

224
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,300
California.
Texas has 4, but New York beats us

225
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:29,500
It was time

226
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,800
I see

227
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,400
25 students and 6 professors who belong
to an extremist association have been arrested

228
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,400
Talking at a business men association lunch,

229
00:19:43,435 --> 00:19:45,065
the governor of California said

230
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,100
that the time to put an end to
student riots has come

231
00:19:48,135 --> 00:19:51,300
And now let's go on
to the weather report

232
00:19:51,335 --> 00:19:53,400
directly from the weather station

233
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,200
I want to go and see what's going on.

234
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,300
When you're finished, leave the line free,
perhaps I'll call you

235
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,700
- Good morning
- How are you?

236
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,765
Mister Giorgio, I'm calling because of this:

237
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,565
as I remember,
three days ago you asked me information

238
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,900
about industrial and textile sectors
on the Stock Exchange of New York

239
00:21:24,935 --> 00:21:28,200
Since the market is moving,
I think it's time to do something

240
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,700
- Do you want to see them again?
- No, thanks Tim.

241
00:21:35,735 --> 00:21:38,465
We'll call your principal
if we need some changes

242
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,700
- Hello guys. - Hi.
- Let me have a quick look at the advertisement

243
00:21:40,735 --> 00:21:44,100
No, the meeting is over.
Go to bed

244
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,500
- Yes, mister Allen?
- Nathalie, where's Daria?

245
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,400
I don't know, I haven't seen her.

246
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,500
- Try at home.
- Yes, at once.

247
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,650
I phoned her home, she didn't answer,

248
00:23:11,685 --> 00:23:14,500
maybe she's ill.
- Doesn't matter.

249
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,765
- Goodbye.
- What?

250
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,265
Hallo? Here is Lee's Associate

251
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,065
Do you know where I can find Daria?

252
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:43,200
- No. She left in the morning.
- Left? On which flight?

253
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:46,265
- No flight.
She took my car

254
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,500
Do you mind telling me who I am talking with?

255
00:23:48,535 --> 00:23:50,500
Yes, I mind. How are you?

256
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,500
In the next 10 years there'll be
three million people more

257
00:24:10,535 --> 00:24:12,667
- Also more are expected.
- Yes, I read it.

258
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:14,800
Are this figures valid for the whole country?

259
00:24:14,835 --> 00:24:16,165
No, just for South California.

260
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,065
- Do you understand what it means?
- What?

261
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,165
It means an expansion
of at least 200.000 hectares.

262
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,400
So our position on the market
requires a global expense

263
00:24:24,435 --> 00:24:27,665
of 5000 billions in three years

264
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,700
- Well, I think we can afford it,
can't we? - Yes, of course

265
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:33,500
Federal and public fees,
the cost of living,

266
00:24:33,535 --> 00:24:35,500
inflation are not even included...

267
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Fuck off

268
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,200
Surround the area all around here.
Block all the entries.

269
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,900
Here is lieutenant Bell
from the metropolitan police department

270
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,400
You've infringed the paragraph 415
of the penal code.

271
00:26:38,435 --> 00:26:40,865
We know you're armed.

272
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,900
If you don't throw away your guns
and come out immediately with your hands up...

273
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,600
...we'll have to take you out
in some other way

274
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,000
Everybody down on the sidewalk

275
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,200
Down, I said!

276
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,600
He's armed!

277
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,200
Stop there, nobody move

278
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,800
Hands up, run

279
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,500
End station

280
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,400
Which bread do you want?

281
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,500
- It's the same. - For me rye bread,
with mayonnaise.

282
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:05,300
This sandwich with salami is a bit poor,
Bob, I'm not on a diet

283
00:30:05,335 --> 00:30:07,000
If you want more, you'll have to pay more

284
00:30:07,035 --> 00:30:08,900
I'll pay, I'll pay, don't worry

285
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,165
- Hallo?
- It's me

286
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,665
- Where are you?
- In a shop.

287
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,200
It's better for you to disappear,
someone called,

288
00:30:14,235 --> 00:30:16,517
he said you were on television. Were you?

289
00:30:16,552 --> 00:30:18,765
What? - On the news.
- Are you sure?

290
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,300
- He said, it looked like you
- Martin...

291
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,300
Hallo? Mark? Hallo!

292
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,600
- Sorry, can I ask you a favor?
- Of course.

293
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,400
I wanted to know if you can give
a sandwich on credit

294
00:30:38,435 --> 00:30:41,017
You see, the problem is not that I don't
trust you,

295
00:30:41,052 --> 00:30:43,600
but if I trust you than I
have to trust everybody

296
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,700
I see.

297
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,865
Where do you think you're going?

298
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,700
I'll go for a ride and come back,
wanna come with me?

299
00:34:01,735 --> 00:34:03,900
- No thanks.
- As you wish.

300
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,200
Lilly 7, Lilly 7, here is tower AN,
stop the take off,

301
00:34:32,235 --> 00:34:33,965
you're on the wrong runway,

302
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,400
there's traffic landing on
the opposite direction

303
00:34:36,435 --> 00:34:37,765
turn as soon as possible,

304
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,900
Lilly 7, Lilly 7, here's tower AN

305
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,200
I don't know, we agree on the estimate
for the first step - Yes?

306
00:36:20,235 --> 00:36:22,765
Why don't you answer the phone?

307
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,465
Yes. We invested 200 millions
plus 40 for unexpected events

308
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,700
Oh no, just a moment, why locking up 40
millions for the unexpected?

309
00:36:29,735 --> 00:36:30,665
What unexpected?

310
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,800
We found some areas with differences
on the level... - Hallo?

311
00:36:32,835 --> 00:36:34,665
...quite relevant, that's the reason - Hi

312
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,200
Land examinations have pointed out
a density index that...

313
00:36:37,235 --> 00:36:38,765
Wait, I'll take the call in my office

314
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,865
...and then the arrangement of collapsing rocks

315
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,200
How do you calculate...
- And when will we know that?

316
00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:45,917
Nancy! It's difficult to make an estimate,

317
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:48,600
at least as long as we are on this first stage

318
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,400
What's the matter Daria, where are you?

319
00:36:56,435 --> 00:36:58,065
I'm in a city here in the desert,

320
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,850
I called to tell you that
I'll get late to Phoenix

321
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,600
- But Why? - I'm looking for a place
called Glenville

322
00:37:03,635 --> 00:37:05,600
or Ballyville or something like that

323
00:37:05,635 --> 00:37:07,365
Something with "Ville" inside.

324
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,500
You know the desert, does it ring a bell?

325
00:37:09,535 --> 00:37:12,300
"Ville"... Hold on, wait.

326
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,550
with "Ville". What do you mean?
Like Denville?

327
00:37:18,585 --> 00:37:21,400
A place in the desert,
Denville is in Connecticut.

328
00:37:21,435 --> 00:37:24,117
Or maybe it ends in "Hill",
a word like that

329
00:37:24,152 --> 00:37:27,126
Yes, well, but why
do you want to go to a town

330
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:30,065
you don't even know the name of?
An appointment?

331
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,650
A friend of mine told me it is
the perfect place to meditate.

332
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:37,192
- And what are you going to do there?
- Thinking of thoughts

333
00:37:37,227 --> 00:37:40,665
thinking of what? Daria! Listen to me,
give me your number,

334
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,350
I'll try to get the name of the town
and I'll call you back, ok?

335
00:37:43,385 --> 00:37:46,000
No no, or else you'd be capable of sending
an helicopter to fetch me

336
00:37:46,035 --> 00:37:49,100
Daria!

337
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,600
- Please come back in three minutes
- Just a moment miss

338
00:37:54,635 --> 00:37:57,065
Listen up, give me your number
and hang up,

339
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,700
I'll call you back in five minutes,
so that I can pay the call.

340
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,700
See you in Phoenix

341
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,250
Excuse me, do you know a place
here in the surroundings

342
00:38:21,285 --> 00:38:23,800
called Glenville or Ballyville
something like that?

343
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,400
- Barkstead?
- Oh, that's it

344
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,400
- Of course, that's where we are
- Oh really?

345
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,500
Did you come here to visit
a James Patterson by chance?

346
00:38:37,535 --> 00:38:40,800
- How do you know that?
- You have the same look.

347
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:46,000
Tell him as for me that
he'll be the death of this town,

348
00:38:46,035 --> 00:38:49,100
that he's going to ruin
a piece of American history.

349
00:38:49,135 --> 00:38:50,600
Jimmy?

350
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,400
- Do you remember Jonny Wilson?
- Jonny Wilson? No.

351
00:39:03,435 --> 00:39:08,265
That's me.
I was middleweight world champion.

352
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:12,300
- Middleweight world champion?
Bravo! - Thank you.

353
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,865
He wants to be a benefactor,

354
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,065
he brought here a pack of children
from Los Angeles

355
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,700
he says, they are ill, traumatized,
do you know what does it mean?

356
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,800
But if Los Angeles doesn't want them,
why should we?

357
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,100
Fuck!

358
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,700
You damned criminals!
Just try to come back!

359
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,850
So, you've seen it with your own eyes,

360
00:39:43,885 --> 00:39:45,900
that glass will cost me 30 dollars

361
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,300
Hey you!
Listen to me!

362
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,000
Hey you!
Hey, come back!

363
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,500
Listen, where's Jimmy?

364
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,300
Where's the guy who brought you here?
Isn't he here with you?

365
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,465
Will you give me a piece of your ass?

366
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,000
- Are you sure you know
what to do with it? - Yes.

367
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,100
What the hell are you doing?

368
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,900
What the hell...
Who the hell is he?

369
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,900
But... But what the hell does that guy want?

370
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,400
Thank you for the T-shirt,
but I don't think it's good for me

371
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,900
Why? Wrong color?

372
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,800
Wrong sex.

373
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,100
- What direction are you taking?
- Phoenix.

374
00:51:18,135 --> 00:51:20,600
Phoenix? There's nothing in Phoenix.

375
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,900
Listen, I'm in trouble.

376
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,565
And, since you are by car,
could you give me a lift?

377
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,200
so that we can go and look for some more petrol.
- Far from here?

378
00:51:31,235 --> 00:51:35,200
I don't know.
That guy said maybe 30 miles.

379
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,600
It's ok.

380
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,600
The radio said,
someone stole a plane this morning.

381
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,000
Tell the truth, was it you?
And why?

382
00:51:52,035 --> 00:51:53,900
To get off the ground

383
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,400
Stop it!

384
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,550
«This is an area of ancient lake beds,

385
00:53:54,585 --> 00:53:56,965
deposited 5 to 10 million years ago.

386
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,150
These beds have been tilted and
pushed upward by earth forces

387
00:54:01,185 --> 00:54:05,300
and eroded by wind and water.
They contain borates and gypsum»

388
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,165
Borates and gypsum?

389
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,500
Two old gold diggers that got lost

390
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:35,300
How do these plants live here?
They're so beautiful

391
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,265
What else do you do, other than flying?

392
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:44,600
Until yesterday I've been driving a
wrecker for a cloth storehouse

393
00:54:44,635 --> 00:54:45,900
But I've been doing also other things

394
00:54:45,935 --> 00:54:48,165
- The university?
- A bit.

395
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,265
Why did you leave it?
Graduated?

396
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:53,500
- Activities out of program.
- What do you mean?

397
00:54:53,535 --> 00:54:56,700
Stealing binded books
instead of pocket editions,

398
00:54:56,735 --> 00:54:59,500
making phone calls from the rector's line,

399
00:54:59,535 --> 00:55:01,500
whistling in the classroom,

400
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:06,500
bringing in forbidden stuff,
like dogs, bikes or women.

401
00:55:06,535 --> 00:55:08,000
What is wrong on that?

402
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,300
We did it in the open.

403
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,200
Once I went to the office
and I reversed the calculators,

404
00:55:15,235 --> 00:55:16,400
and so...

405
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:19,700
They kicked me out.

406
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,900
You know why? Because I've sent
engineers to art classes

407
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,300
Uhm, she's coming down too

408
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,200
Tell me the rest of your braveries

409
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,100
Once I painted myself black,
but it didn't work,

410
00:55:38,135 --> 00:55:39,800
so I turned to be as I was before

411
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,600
Did you hear that Mexicans
are bombarding marijuana fields on the border?

412
00:55:48,635 --> 00:55:51,200
I'd like to know what else is happening

413
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,400
Nothing about the demonstration?

414
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:56,365
No, I prefer to listen to some music

415
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,900
Now they speak about it only if there are
at least 200 or 300 wounded

416
00:55:59,935 --> 00:56:02,000
Yes, some kind of record

417
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:03,865
Or a dead

418
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,765
Yes, someone killed a policeman,

419
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,300
and someone trampled on the flowerbed

420
00:56:08,335 --> 00:56:10,765
I was looking for a rock station.

421
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,900
They said the guy who killed the
agent was a white man

422
00:56:13,935 --> 00:56:16,000
Uhm, a white man
going on the black's side, eh?

423
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,600
just like the old John Brown

424
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,700
Do you want us to go to the river?

425
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,600
- See you down there!
- Wait!

426
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:09,100
Hey you, foolhardy!

427
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,900
Are you ok?

428
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,600
Do you want to smoke?

429
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:50,900
- Look, you're not talking to a free man.
- What does it mean?

430
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,065
Perhaps it's nothing serious,

431
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:57,400
but the people of my group have some
rules about smoking,

432
00:57:57,435 --> 00:58:00,100
they're bound to reality

433
00:58:00,135 --> 00:58:01,900
What a bore!

434
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,400
Let's look for some shade

435
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,665
What does it mean
"bound to reality"?

436
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:32,900
Oh yes, they're not able
to imagine anything

437
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,700
Sorry, but, you know, you could have left them

438
00:58:36,735 --> 00:58:38,465
I wasn't really in a group,

439
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:42,165
you know, all that chatting makes me sick

440
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:45,500
but at a certain point you have
to decide for one side or the other

441
00:58:45,535 --> 00:58:48,300
There are lots of sides,
not only the good and the bad

442
00:58:48,335 --> 00:58:49,465
Stop it

443
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,365
- What's your name?
- Daria.

444
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,500
The point is that if you don't
recognize them as the bad ones,

445
00:58:53,535 --> 00:58:54,800
you can't get rid of them

446
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,600
Do you think that if we get rid of them,
the world is going to be different?

447
00:58:59,635 --> 00:59:03,000
Why not? Can you think
of something better for us to do?

448
00:59:03,035 --> 00:59:05,400
Us who? Your group?

449
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,400
You and me

450
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,800
You and me?

451
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,600
It's nice here,

452
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,700
It's quiet

453
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,800
It's dead

454
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,300
Ok, It's dead

455
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,300
So let's play a game

456
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:45,900
You'll start from a side of the valley,

457
00:59:45,935 --> 00:59:47,667
I'll start from the other side

458
00:59:47,702 --> 00:59:49,400
And we'll see, who kills the most

459
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:54,400
We'll begin with snakes and lizards,
and then go on with wild rabbits

460
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,900
At the end we'll count how many we've killed,

461
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,165
and the winner will kill the looser

462
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,200
Did I say something stupid?
Don't you want to play this game?

463
01:00:05,235 --> 01:00:07,400
I don't want to play any game

464
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,600
It's nice of you to stay
with a guy who doesn't smoke

465
01:00:18,635 --> 01:00:20,465
I'm tolerant

466
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:23,500
But what are you doing here?
Phoenix, are you serious?

467
01:00:23,535 --> 01:00:26,000
Because of work.
I have to go there

468
01:00:26,035 --> 01:00:27,700
You're really tolerant

469
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:51,200
Pretend that your thoughts are plants

470
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,565
Ok

471
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:57,450
What do they look like?
Grown like in a garden

472
01:00:57,485 --> 01:01:01,300
or wild, like a fern or a rambling,
I mean weeds

473
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,700
A sort of jungle

474
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,500
It'd be nice to plant
thoughts in heads,

475
01:01:09,535 --> 01:01:12,000
so that no one would have bad memories

476
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:15,200
It could be possible to plant, you know,

477
01:01:15,235 --> 01:01:17,000
only the good things you've made

478
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:19,400
like a happy childhood,

479
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,165
strong parents,

480
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,865
only the good things

481
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:26,165
Just to forget how horrible it was

482
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:29,200
That's the point!
There's nothing horrible

483
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,400
Please!

484
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,900
Sometimes I feel like shouting

485
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:50,100
Why don't you do it?
There's nobody around here,

486
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,565
nothing, just the desert

487
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:56,400
- But if someone...? - Yeah, a ghost,
you can wake the dead.

488
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,900
At any rate

489
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,400
At any rate

490
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,165
What?

491
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,865
It should be just one word

492
01:02:56,900 --> 01:03:00,400
The name of a place.
Or a river

493
01:03:00,435 --> 01:03:02,500
The river "atanyrate"

494
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:20,900
- Hey! Look what I've found!
- Uhm, well done

495
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,800
- What's that thing? Chalk?
- It isn't salt.

496
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,400
- Do you want to come with me?
- Where?

497
01:03:52,435 --> 01:03:54,365
Anywhere I'm going

498
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,550
Are you asking seriously?

499
01:03:56,585 --> 01:03:58,700
Are you answering seriously?

500
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:43,600
They should build a drive-in here.
It'd be a business

501
01:11:43,635 --> 01:11:44,800
Why don't you do it?

502
01:11:44,835 --> 01:11:47,100
Should I? Oh!

503
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,300
- Something wrong?
- No, I was going to the toilet

504
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,265
Where's your car?

505
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:18,565
I forgot it down there,

506
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:24,900
together with my chequebook, credit card,
insurance policy, birth certificate and...

507
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,000
Goodbye

508
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,300
What's wrong with you?
Are you crazy?

509
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,300
Is it loaded?

510
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,300
No

511
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:56,200
- Are you looking for water?
- I'm burning it

512
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:02,700
Why did you ask me about the strike?
Were you there?

513
01:15:02,735 --> 01:15:04,800
The guy who killed the agent...

514
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:15,350
No. I wanted to do it,
but someone else did it.

515
01:15:15,385 --> 01:15:18,900
- But they said...
- Who said? - The radio.

516
01:15:18,935 --> 01:15:21,100
I never shot a bullet

517
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,400
You could need it.
It'll be difficult to persuade them

518
01:15:28,435 --> 01:15:30,400
I don't even think about it

519
01:15:30,435 --> 01:15:33,200
Why? I believe you

520
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:40,800
Let's go back to the car

521
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:46,000
Let's go away from here. If you cut your hair,
who is going to recognize you?

522
01:15:46,035 --> 01:15:48,000
Do you think I should cut my hair?

523
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:58,200
No, you look very nice

524
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,665
Maybe they'll think it's not an airplane

525
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:17,000
«Strange prehistoric bird flies over the Mojave desert,
with the balls hanging»

526
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:23,865
I think you're crazy flying
this thing back to Los Angeles

527
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:27,900
Of course. You cannot steal a private plane,
use it as you want,

528
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:30,300
and then don't go back and thank.

529
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:40,500
It's nice to see
a young man showing some respect

530
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:56,700
- It's beautiful. Great Grandpa.
- Of course it's beautiful

531
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:00,700
Do you really think,
you'll make it?

532
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:04,265
I'll just land at the end of the runway,
far from the tower,

533
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:08,300
From there I'll make it. I'll run to the city,
before they realize what happened

534
01:17:08,335 --> 01:17:12,300
Why do you have to take it back?
You can come with me to Phoenix,

535
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:15,600
- Why do you need to take this chance?
- I like to risk.

536
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:25,300
- Well, it's beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

537
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:45,165
- Did you use the plane often?
- Yes.

538
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,865
Are you insured
against damage and stealing?

539
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:51,900
Yes, of course. It's a small plane,
but not cheap at all, you know

540
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,000
My wife liked it a lot.
I painted it with her favorite color, pink

541
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:04,600
- Did you talk to the young man?
- Yes, I did.

542
01:19:04,635 --> 01:19:05,765
And what did he say?

543
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:10,300
Well, he asked me to go for a ride,
it seemed that the plane was his own

544
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:12,000
Did you believe him?

545
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,165
No.

546
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:18,300
- Well, then why did you let him go away?
- I don't know.

547
01:19:18,335 --> 01:19:19,765
Do you remember how he was dressed?

548
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:22,565
He was wearing a T-shirt,
and long hair.

549
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:28,900
- How old do you think he was?
- May, 30. Maybe less, 20. 21

550
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,000
The 4H Club has organized a sport
Sunday at the Schoneberg school stadium

551
01:21:22,035 --> 01:21:26,000
A rodeo will take place, and there’ll
be horses, dust and fun for everybody

552
01:21:26,035 --> 01:21:28,300
and quite a lot of ice creams, I'm sure

553
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:42,000
Here Lilly 7 is on sight,
coming from north:

554
01:23:42,035 --> 01:23:44,100
it's approaching the landing runway

555
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,200
Received

556
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Take-offs are suspended.
Incoming planes stay on hold

557
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,365
KHT759. Here's KHT652.
Do you copy?

558
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:14,765
KHT652 to KHT759. You'd have to see it,
you wouldn't believe your eyes

559
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:18,800
- What's going on? - Nothing, they just
enjoyed themself painting it everywhere.

560
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:44,400
Call an ambulance

561
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:47,000
Give me a tool to open it

562
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:05,865
The attempt of aerial piracy
reached a tragic end this morning

563
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:09,100
The episode happened when the police, after trying
to block the plane with no results,

564
01:28:09,135 --> 01:28:10,465
had to open the fire.

565
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:13,865
Several shots from an unidentified
agent reached the cockpit

566
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:18,900
The young man inside died on the spot.
Stay tuned for more details

567
01:28:18,935 --> 01:28:21,600
Our program goes on with John Payne

568
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:18,800
- Why, what was he looking like?
- Don't ask her

569
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:23,300
If this evening I get drunk,
I'll tell you everything

570
01:31:23,335 --> 01:31:25,800
You know, there's nothing
to do this evening

571
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,200
Hello?

572
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:31,800
It's for you

573
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:37,100
Hello? hi, she said
she'll be here in a moment

574
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,500
Another time

575
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,665
- Do you need a light?
- Yes, thanks.

576
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:47,400
It's really interesting,
what Nicky said. It seems,

577
01:31:47,435 --> 01:31:50,100
she was here by the swimming-pool,
she saw everything

578
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:25,165
Dear Larry,
if these are your last conditions,

579
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:28,700
I can't see how I could possibly
present them to my partners

580
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:31,500
Your proposal is unacceptable

581
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:34,865
Listen Jack, you know very well
that the price of something

582
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:38,000
is neither high nor low when it's not
referred to its potential use

583
01:33:38,035 --> 01:33:39,065
Right? - Yes.

584
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:43,100
The only question here is: does this
ground have a value to you?

585
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:47,465
Honestly,
I don't think it has any.

586
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:51,400
And we don't want to commit
ourselves more than you do

587
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:39,800
He talks about potential use.
This is speculation

588
01:34:39,835 --> 01:34:42,200
Why should I accept
speculation prices?

589
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:45,000
Don't you think they'll come?

590
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:55,100
What do you think?
Should we hold on?

591
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,200
Daria!

592
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:27,800
Hey

593
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:33,100
What happened to you?
Did you fall in the swimming-pool?

594
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:37,750
Anyway, you're here now,
it's the only thing that counts

595
01:35:37,785 --> 01:35:40,865
Listen up, Now you go downstairs,
and change your dress

596
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:43,400
Your room is the first on the right,
at the end of the staircase

597
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:13,100
It's obvious that this area has got a
lot of development possibilities,

598
01:38:13,135 --> 01:38:16,400
such as a beach, a lake, where you can live
quietly, as you please...

599
01:38:16,435 --> 01:38:18,100
...and comfortably

600
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:21,700
I must say that this business
makes me enthusiastic, but...

601
01:38:21,735 --> 01:38:24,317
Maybe we'll end up finding
gold in this property

602
01:38:24,352 --> 01:38:26,900
If we find water, we'll find also gold for sure

603
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:29,565
In this country water is gold

604
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:33,365
Water, electrification,
the landing runway, roads

605
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:35,900
the arrangement of beaches and all the
other subsidiary equipment

606
01:38:35,935 --> 01:38:39,600
are only details of our general project.
