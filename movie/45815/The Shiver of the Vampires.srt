1
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:07,618
Listen. In a while I will return
to the radiant darkness of death.

2
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:13,624
But first, I want to give you
the means to save your lives

3
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:18,128
and even a chance to save my soul.

4
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:23,717
Later tonight,
as soon as death has taken me,

5
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:26,011
I want you to go to the cemetery.

6
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,307
Hurry, before it's too late.

7
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,851
Go to their tomb

8
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:36,605
and drive this stake into their hearts
so they are destroyed forever.

9
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,694
Pull this stake from my heart and kill them.

10
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:47,074
Listen, if you are too late,

11
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,535
swear that you will serve them.

12
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,996
That way your lives will be spared.

13
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,794
They need living accomplices
to supply them with victims.

14
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:04,508
Now let the light strike me down.

15
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,636
Is it a good place for a honeymoon?

16
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,763
It's a very beautiful castle, you'll see.

17
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,892
I really want to see my two cousins again.

18
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,561
I only saw them when I was little,

19
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,898
and I have wonderful memories of it.

20
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,568
They're quite strange,

21
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:55,530
but children are always fascinated
by anything unusual.

22
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,991
I don't mind.

23
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,911
I just hope
it doesn't delay our trip to Italy.

24
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:39,199
The castle is at the end of that lane,

25
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,535
but you will find it empty.

26
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:43,704
Empty?

27
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,833
They both died yesterday.

28
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,211
You will only be able to see
their two servants.

29
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:55,632
Strange things have been happening here

30
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:58,176
since they're not here to protect us.

31
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:03,807
But... go up to the castle. Go on.

32
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,531
do you know what I've just been told?

33
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,492
I hope you won't be too upset.

34
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,704
- What is it?
- Your cousins are dead.

35
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,664
- Dead?

36
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,750
They've just been buried.

37
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:34,463
- That's strange. Are you sure?

38
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,216
I can't believe it.

39
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:35,060
My cousins were expecting us.

40
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,145
We just got married.

41
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:42,984
That explains our inappropriate dress,
but we had no way of knowing.

42
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:46,279
The occupants are delighted
to welcome you.

43
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:49,532
The rooms are ready.
If you'd just follow us.

44
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:52,429
What a peculiar place.

45
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:58,893
Antoine, I won't be able to relax
until I've visited my cousins one last time.

46
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,606
I'm going to visit their tomb.
I really have to.

47
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,944
I feel I owe it to them.

48
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,906
- I'm going to go alone.
- But why?

49
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,491
Please.

50
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:41,204
I'm Isabelle.

51
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,624
Why are you praying at this tomb?

52
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:48,211
- Two men are buried here.
- I know.

53
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,213
They were my last relatives.

54
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:54,717
Your dress is new.

55
00:18:56,219 --> 00:19:01,099
Mine was worn by my mother
when my father died.

56
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,394
She died not long after.

57
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:09,524
Now I'm the one wearing the widow's veils.

58
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,193
- For whom?
- For them.

59
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,278
Them?

60
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:17,949
We were to be married,
but I was already their bride.

61
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,450
Whose bride?

62
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:23,913
Who knows? Maybe of both of them.

63
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:29,335
Now I'm mourning both of them.

64
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,088
I've been widowed twice.

65
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:43,826
Antoine, please let me sleep alone tonight.

66
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:46,996
My cousins' deaths have really upset me.

67
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:51,459
Please understand, Antoine.
Don't be angry with me.

68
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,449
Who are you?

69
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,452
I'm Isolde.

70
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,245
You are Isle.

71
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,434
I'm your friend.

72
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:59,772
I have some things to tell you,
to explain to you, to show you.

73
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:43,733
This is where the living
make a religion of respecting the dead.

74
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:49,238
This is where the dead
make a religion of preserving their lives.

75
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:30,102
- Why, Master?
- It has to be done.

76
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:34,607
The terrible curse which is ours
must not be passed on.

77
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:37,443
Couldn't she live, Master?

78
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:40,946
She could, but only as the dead live.

79
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:44,116
She would have to share our eternity.

80
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,203
She should never have entered
this sinister vault.

81
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:50,623
This is the price we pay for our safety.

82
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:55,211
Our evil should not be propagated.
We would be discovered.

83
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:58,798
Go and see if our guests are resting.

84
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:19,795
What will happen to you now?

85
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:23,883
Loneliness does not trouble us
when we are near our masters.

86
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:27,720
- And now that they've left?
- They haven't left us.

87
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:30,347
They haven't left anything or anyone.

88
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:34,560
The way you remember them is touching,

89
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:40,149
but the fact is,
we will never see them again, so -

90
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:47,031
We'll see them once their work is finished.

91
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:49,825
- In the library.
- What do you mean?

92
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:52,369
What library?

93
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:55,372
I really don't know what's going on.

94
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:04,506
This is the time of day they usually work.

95
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:10,554
They'll come to see you
when they are finished.

96
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:20,898
- So, they're alive?
- But we were told they were dead.

97
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,942
Isle went to their tomb and now -

98
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:25,361
They could at least meet us.

99
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:30,074
What about Isabelle?
She thinks they're dead too.

100
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:33,243
That's what people in the village are saying.

101
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:38,624
You shouldn't pay attention to rumours.

102
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:42,252
Of course, it was them I saw last night.

103
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:45,172
- You saw them last night?
- Don't you remember?

104
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:48,050
- I was asleep.
- Listen.

105
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:53,555
You weren't in your room,
so I went looking for you in the park.

106
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:56,433
I saw two men in a chapel.

107
00:32:57,518 --> 00:32:59,770
<i>The two servants were there.</i>

108
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:04,316
<i>Some sort of ceremony was
being carried out. A human sacrifice.</i>

109
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,860
<i>The two men were covered in blood.</i>

110
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:09,905
<i>I was afraid for you.
I hurried back,</i>

111
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:12,282
<i>but you were sound asleep.</i>

112
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:15,244
<i>I thought I was hallucinating.</i>

113
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:21,750
<i>Now, if the lords are alive, I wonder-</i>

114
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:26,088
<i>I'm going to try to find them.</i>

115
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:44,940
They work during the day,
in their library.

116
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:55,941
What happened? Where were you?

117
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,860
I went to look in the library.

118
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:26,888
- Are they the men you saw?
- Yes. That's them.

119
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:47,576
So this is our dear cousin.

120
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:50,287
And our latest cousin.

121
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:53,999
Please excuse our late arrival.

122
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,470
It's little Isle.

123
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:00,547
So different now.

124
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:06,970
And this must be Antoine.

125
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:11,350
My dear Antoine, what happened to you?

126
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:13,101
An unfortunate accident.

127
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:17,064
Old castles are dangerous.

128
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,983
Full of traps and mysteries.

129
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:22,110
You have to be very careful.

130
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:23,987
Very careful.

131
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:37,167
We were surprised to hear of your deaths.

132
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,128
Your reappearance is even more surprising.

133
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,799
We never disappeared.

134
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:46,885
That's just a story, a joke.

135
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,013
Made up by the locals.

136
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:53,266
It's unbelievable.
What kind of life do you lead?

137
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:57,229
These days everything
is unbelievable, my friend.

138
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:01,400
We lead the life we have to live.

139
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:05,153
What about you,
did you choose your life?

140
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,907
In any case,
mine doesn't seem so strange.

141
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:12,411
Appearances are deceptive.
What do you do?

142
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:14,204
I'm an electronics engineer.

143
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:18,834
Is it unbelievable to substitute
an electronic brain for a man's?

144
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:22,170
It's more than unbelievable.
It's dangerous.

145
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:28,677
- Our life is the result of our work.
- It's related to our work.

146
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:31,888
- What work?
- Very important work.

147
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:38,186
We researched the historical origins
of our family. We have studied -

148
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:42,524
The religions
our family practised over the years.

149
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:48,196
- We were lifted very high.
- We were taken very low.

150
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,825
We discovered that the roots
of our family go back

151
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:57,038
to very precise religious origins.

152
00:40:57,706 --> 00:41:00,667
Which were of great scientific interest.

153
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,462
That hardly seems to be scientific progress.

154
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:09,217
If you ate instead of talking,
at least your meal would progress.

155
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,637
What about you?
You're not eating very much.

156
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:17,684
- In fact, I wonder if you eat at all.
- Antoine, please.

157
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:22,105
- Actually, we do eat.
- But very little lately.

158
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:24,524
- But before -
- Things were different.

159
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:30,071
But what about the research
you carried out?

160
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:34,576
You must have learned something
important about your origins.

161
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:39,998
- We learned that our family -
- Which we traced way back.

162
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:46,338
Significantly helped some religions survive
at the end of the Middle Ages.

163
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:49,633
The worship of the goddess Isis.

164
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:52,844
You're Egyptologists?
Egyptologists -

165
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:57,224
No, I mean the religion
which continued in Europe

166
00:41:57,307 --> 00:42:01,937
in spite of the persecution
it suffered from the Catholic Church.

167
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:07,734
That is why things were borrowed
from foreign religions.

168
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:10,904
- Like the goddess Isis.
- Who we already mentioned.

169
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:14,908
Christians hunted down their enemies.

170
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:19,913
They adopted the ancient religion
of the horned god

171
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:22,374
who has been worshipped since prehistory.

172
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:27,462
Violently persecuted,
this religion went undercover.

173
00:42:27,546 --> 00:42:31,216
Although they claimed
to worship the goddess Isis,

174
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:36,721
in actual fact, they had turned
a male god of local origin

175
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:39,808
into a female god of foreign origin.

176
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:43,520
So those who opposed Christianity

177
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:47,315
adopted two arguments
against their persecutors.

178
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:49,317
They'd say:

179
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:51,570
“We can't be blamed
for worshipping the horned god,

180
00:42:51,653 --> 00:42:53,280
because she's a woman.”

181
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:59,077
Or: “She's a woman,
so we don't revere an idol.”

182
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,288
This woman was the Virgin Mary.

183
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:07,419
As I said, it was all about derision,
because it was verging on blasphemy.

184
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:12,549
In fact, it was all about blaspheming
the Virgin Mary.

185
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:16,928
With this notion of reversal,
derision and blasphemy,

186
00:43:17,012 --> 00:43:20,890
we then take up this reversal of rites,

187
00:43:20,974 --> 00:43:24,686
which was later to give us Black Masses.

188
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:28,940
The worship of the dear Isis

189
00:43:29,024 --> 00:43:33,153
is at the very heart
of the Western crisis at that time.

190
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:38,617
- It's also at the heart, the very heart -
- Of our research.

191
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:41,030
We're alone at last.

192
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:44,951
Please, let me be alone again tonight.

193
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:47,996
We're alone.

194
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,331
Your cousins are weird.
Don't take them seriously.

195
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:55,336
I've had enough of your cousins
and their muttering.

196
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:58,882
Don't get upset. You just said
not to take them seriously.

197
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:02,594
- They're intelligent.
- Intelligent but crazy.

198
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:04,345
I'm not hanging around here.

199
00:48:39,626 --> 00:48:41,586
It's 9:00.

200
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:43,838
I remember.

201
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:46,758
They always went out at this time.

202
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:50,511
They used to send Anubis,
their dog, to fetch me.

203
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:53,765
<i>They went out hunting.</i>

204
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:57,018
<i>They hunted at night, like wolves.</i>

205
00:48:57,936 --> 00:48:59,938
<i>They were so cheerful.</i>

206
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,359
<i>Sometimes I'd slip away and go with them.</i>

207
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:07,153
<i>You wouldn't have understood.</i>

208
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:11,282
<i>They hunted their dreadful prey with stakes.</i>

209
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:16,496
<i>They carried holy scapulars and crosses.</i>

210
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:22,377
<i>They looked like two lords
from the ancient era of the Crusades.</i>

211
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:27,548
<i>They'd return covered in blood
and drunk from the battle.</i>

212
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:30,051
<i>But one day...</i>

213
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:34,597
<i>they returned
with wounds on their necks.</i>

214
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:41,229
They had what looked like bites
which were bleeding.

215
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:44,107
Bleeding.

216
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:47,902
They bled to death.

217
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:15,179
It's Anubis, their dog.

218
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:17,432
He's calling me.

219
00:50:35,158 --> 00:50:36,659
Who are you?

220
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:39,328
Why did you bring me here?

221
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:42,957
Did you send Anubis to me?

222
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:45,334
What do you know?

223
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:52,216
Miss, I know that Anubis
used to bark under your window

224
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,886
when your lovers wished to see you.

225
00:50:54,969 --> 00:51:00,141
You hounded the two masters
of the castle with your selfish love.

226
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:04,062
That will have to stop immediately.

227
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:07,523
The lords have been dead for several days,

228
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:12,570
and my love for them only troubles me now.

229
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:13,613
Turn around.

230
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:19,368
One moment.
You are no longer welcome here.

231
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:24,332
You cannot deal with what I am
or what they are now.

232
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:28,169
What's going on?

233
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:31,089
What's happened to you?

234
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:34,008
I loved you. Remember?

235
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:37,595
You were men when I loved you.

236
00:51:38,346 --> 00:51:40,598
Look at you now.

237
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:44,560
Why do you obey this creature?

238
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:45,705
That was good.

239
00:52:46,247 --> 00:52:49,667
You adopted the only behaviour
that was appropriate:

240
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,377
Silence.

241
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:54,046
She was the last connection
with our former life.

242
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:58,134
We are now free. Free,

243
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:00,469
never to die again.

244
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:03,264
We are free never to live again.

245
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:06,934
You have forgotten something else
about your past.

246
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:12,607
You mean to say...

247
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:16,194
you're going to kill poor Isle too.

248
00:53:18,154 --> 00:53:22,491
I seduced her. it's taken care of.

249
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:24,952
Would it matter to you?

250
00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:29,999
We have to turn her into
one of our own race, your own race.

251
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:32,460
Enough. Don't be insolent.

252
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,337
Her name is Isle.

253
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:37,757
She was predestined for it,
just like you were.

254
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:42,637
I implore you, Isolde.
Don't rub salt into the wound.

255
00:53:44,305 --> 00:53:47,892
I see. You have not yet forgotten

256
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:50,978
that not long ago
you were vampire slayers.

257
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:56,901
It didn't stop you becoming vampires,
because it was your fate.

258
00:53:56,984 --> 00:53:59,946
If this monster hadn't bitten us -

259
00:54:00,029 --> 00:54:02,323
Who are you calling a monster?

260
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:06,327
Do you think this is an ideal situation for us?

261
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:12,416
Our body requires that we satisfy
our most beastly appetites,

262
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:16,629
whilst our lucid spirits
wish to fight against them.

263
00:54:17,463 --> 00:54:21,842
And, above all,
fight against your atrocious revenge.

264
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:24,762
I'm proud of the way I am.

265
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:27,848
I appreciate my position
as a wandering vampire.

266
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:32,645
It's an honour, a very important privilege.

267
00:54:33,688 --> 00:54:37,108
The master of the world
sends me where I can be of use.

268
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:43,656
Without me, the monster, as you call him,
would never have infected you.

269
00:54:44,073 --> 00:54:48,995
I remember that your sudden appearance
that night paralysed us.

270
00:54:52,665 --> 00:54:58,004
The same way my gaze paralysed Isle
and placed her at my mercy.

271
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:03,301
Why us?

272
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:05,177
I will remind you again.

273
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,513
It was your destiny.

274
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:12,393
In antiquity, this region
was a kingdom of vampires.

275
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:15,062
There are many in the world.

276
00:55:16,022 --> 00:55:19,233
Even your research brought you to us.

277
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:23,863
- Nothing happens by chance.
- It's outrageous.

278
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:27,033
It isn't. You're still at home.

279
00:55:27,116 --> 00:55:30,578
You have your own tombs
to escape the light of day...

280
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,831
and devoted servants.

281
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:36,083
You're bourgeois vampires.

282
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:46,594
Why aren't we the same as you?

283
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:50,931
You're a wandering vampire
and we're bourgeois vampires, you say?

284
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:54,518
My parents were both vampires

285
00:55:54,602 --> 00:55:58,105
who were able to give me eternal life.

286
00:55:58,189 --> 00:56:02,276
When I was born, the master of the world
invested them as initiates.

287
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:11,160
In short, you killed Isabelle,
who could have given us a child,

288
00:56:11,243 --> 00:56:15,331
so we couldn't become initiates,
making us your superiors.

289
00:56:20,503 --> 00:56:23,047
She loved you
because you hunted vampires.

290
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:27,218
- She'd never accept you like this.
- What do you know?

291
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:31,972
Why didn't you try to seduce Isabelle
like you did Isle?

292
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:37,478
You had made her a woman.
She was too set in her ways.

293
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:41,732
You gave her a joyous life in that village.

294
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:46,821
But I'll give you Isle to console you.

295
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:48,572
She is all ready.

296
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:55,162
You are just as desirable as Isabelle, Isolde.

297
00:56:57,498 --> 00:57:01,419
And we are still masters
of this faraway village.

298
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:05,506
We could both take you,
just like we took Isabelle.

299
00:57:06,257 --> 00:57:07,591
Stop.

300
00:57:07,675 --> 00:57:11,220
Stop it. I hate men. I hate them.

301
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:24,525
No! Leave me alone.

302
00:58:44,313 --> 00:58:46,190
Who's going to wake him, and how?

303
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:48,776
He must wake up naturally.

304
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:54,365
We'll wake him gently.
One of us will slip next to him.

305
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:57,535
He's had a long period of abstinence.

306
00:58:57,618 --> 00:59:00,162
We need to awaken his desire
so he'll open his eyes.

307
00:59:00,246 --> 00:59:01,705
- You do it.
- You do it.

308
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:03,541
- No, you.
- No, you.

309
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:05,626
We'll both have to do it.

310
01:02:40,424 --> 01:02:42,009
Where are they?

311
01:02:42,634 --> 01:02:43,927
I'm going mad.

312
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:59,276
I don't really know what I saw,
or thought I saw,

313
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:01,779
but I know these people are dangerous.

314
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:03,781
We must leave straight away.

315
01:03:03,864 --> 01:03:08,368
No, it's not possible. I feel weak.
I need peace and rest.

316
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:10,412
You won't get any rest here.

317
01:03:10,496 --> 01:03:14,666
I'll help you, even carry you,
but we must go.

318
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:19,004
You don't understand. I love my cousins.
They're my only family.

319
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:21,381
I thought I'd lost them.

320
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:24,551
Your only family?
What about me? I'm your husband.

321
01:03:25,636 --> 01:03:29,932
Of course you are, Antoine,
but it's not the same.

322
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:34,144
- And you aren't truly my husband yet.
- Is that my fault?

323
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:37,523
If that's the way it is, I'll stay.

324
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:47,718
- Isle, what's the matter?
- It's the window, the light.

325
01:04:47,801 --> 01:04:49,511
What are you talking about?

326
01:04:50,137 --> 01:04:51,930
The daylight hurts my eyes.

327
01:04:52,014 --> 01:04:55,851
You're not awake yet. Let's go out.
The fresh air will do you good.

328
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:29,927
You've changed since we've been here.

329
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:35,307
You seem... distant.

330
01:05:37,017 --> 01:05:38,518
Lost.

331
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:42,189
- Isolde.
- What did you say?

332
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:52,532
Isn't that the name of that woman
who took you to that ceremony?

333
01:05:52,616 --> 01:05:54,618
So I wasn't dreaming.

334
01:06:44,251 --> 01:06:47,045
Leave it. Leave it alone.

335
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:51,091
What's happening? What's the matter?

336
01:06:51,717 --> 01:06:55,804
- Are you ill?
- No, it's nothing. I'm all right.

337
01:06:56,388 --> 01:06:59,975
- The daylight hurts my eyes.
- The daylight hurts your eyes?

338
01:07:00,684 --> 01:07:05,188
Go and fetch my sunglasses
from the car, please.

339
01:09:04,891 --> 01:09:06,268
Don't open it.

340
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:08,270
The daylight will kill me.

341
01:09:14,568 --> 01:09:18,405
The blood that you spilled near me
woke me too early.

342
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:22,993
If my eyes were to see the daylight
it would kill me.

343
01:09:44,556 --> 01:09:48,435
Isle, I can feel you're hesitating.
Are you going to open it?

344
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:50,812
What will you decide?

345
01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:55,483
I don't know.
I don't know what to do.

346
01:09:55,567 --> 01:09:57,652
I don't really know who you are.

347
01:09:58,236 --> 01:09:59,821
Or even who I am.

348
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:09,539
I belong to the world of darkness
whose eternal joys will be yours.

349
01:10:10,332 --> 01:10:14,294
Your cousins and I
are messengers down here.

350
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:19,633
If you spare me, you will become
one of us and others like us.

351
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:22,719
If, on the other hand,
you open this coffin,

352
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:26,264
you will be left alone in this world

353
01:10:26,348 --> 01:10:30,143
to carry the weight
of an unbearable mortality.

354
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:07,138
Take me back to my room.
I'll feel better tonight.

355
01:12:56,956 --> 01:13:00,210
No, I'm too weary to walk.

356
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:04,255
You're wrong to be afraid of my cousins.
They don't mean any harm.

357
01:13:04,839 --> 01:13:07,884
I love them. I love all three of them.

358
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:54,133
- Quick, we must get out of here.
- Why? What happened?

359
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:58,721
They are vampires, both of them.
I saw them drinking blood.

360
01:15:58,805 --> 01:16:01,891
We must leave while we're still alive.

361
01:16:02,976 --> 01:16:06,437
They are alive, and will be so eternally.

362
01:16:06,521 --> 01:16:09,148
What? What are you saying?

363
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:13,152
- Why are you dressed like that?
- There's a wedding today.

364
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:17,740
The ceremony which will make me
the same as Isolde

365
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:20,368
and my two companions.

366
01:16:20,451 --> 01:16:22,537
Isle, I don't recognise you.

367
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:24,622
Who is Isolde?

368
01:16:24,706 --> 01:16:27,834
You will see her, anytime now.

369
01:16:28,418 --> 01:16:30,003
It's time.

370
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:35,508
How will she appear?

371
01:16:37,302 --> 01:16:39,012
From where will she arise?

372
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:20,887
This is Isolde. She's my friend.

373
01:17:27,769 --> 01:17:29,562
It's too late.

374
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:23,282
- You seem anxious, Antoine.
- Why is the table only set for one?

375
01:18:23,366 --> 01:18:26,536
Isle fears the light.
Can't she eat now?

376
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:28,413
- Food?
- Food.

377
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:33,584
As you are aware, we need just a small diet,
from time to time.

378
01:18:34,085 --> 01:18:37,797
A little diet has never hurt any woman.

379
01:18:38,131 --> 01:18:41,092
As for her fear of daylight, well -

380
01:18:41,175 --> 01:18:45,847
it's photophobia. it's quite common.

381
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:48,349
It's quite normal.

382
01:18:48,975 --> 01:18:51,561
And it is recognized by psychiatrists.

383
01:18:51,644 --> 01:18:53,730
All it takes is a slight imbalance.

384
01:18:53,813 --> 01:18:57,608
- Slightly high blood pressure.
- Tiredness.

385
01:18:57,692 --> 01:19:01,654
Take me, for example. Often I -

386
01:19:02,822 --> 01:19:08,244
The slightest psychological disorder
and photophobia occurs.

387
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:13,332
You needn't worry.

388
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:16,335
It's quite normal.

389
01:19:16,419 --> 01:19:20,840
I'd say the fear of sunlight
is just as normal as -

390
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:23,009
The fear of God.

391
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:29,348
- Sunlight is the beginning of lunar-
- Wisdom.

392
01:19:29,432 --> 01:19:32,226
The wisdom that was our ancestors',

393
01:19:33,144 --> 01:19:35,855
great admirers of the night sky.

394
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:39,609
Direct ancestors of us and our cousin.

395
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:41,277
Direct ancestors.

396
01:20:09,639 --> 01:20:11,724
Get rid of that crucifix.

397
01:20:14,268 --> 01:20:16,103
Grab him.

398
01:20:16,187 --> 01:20:17,688
Fetch the ropes.

399
01:20:19,398 --> 01:20:21,317
I've got him.

400
01:20:31,327 --> 01:20:34,580
Isle, you betrayed me.

401
01:20:34,664 --> 01:20:39,001
They'll turn you into a vampire.
It's inadmissible.

402
01:20:39,085 --> 01:20:44,048
But everything is admissible.
We are just as admissible as you.

403
01:20:44,674 --> 01:20:47,176
Despite all the differences between us.

404
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:52,807
We understand that these differences
might shock you at first.

405
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:57,353
If we're so different,
why can't you leave us alone?

406
01:20:57,436 --> 01:21:00,898
You've touched a sore point.

407
01:21:00,982 --> 01:21:03,442
A sore point for Isle and me.

408
01:21:03,526 --> 01:21:06,195
A sore point for us, believe me.

409
01:21:07,363 --> 01:21:10,032
Don't think we've always been this way.

410
01:21:10,116 --> 01:21:12,535
I don't care what you were like!

411
01:21:12,618 --> 01:21:14,787
Very well, but you're making a mistake.

412
01:21:15,746 --> 01:21:19,083
- It will help you understand.
- To understand us.

413
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:23,796
It will help you understand
the situation we're all in today.

414
01:21:24,171 --> 01:21:25,381
You and us.

415
01:21:25,464 --> 01:21:30,970
In brief, the research we spoke of earlier-

416
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:35,433
- Took us from one religion to another.
- Each one more underground.

417
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:38,811
Until we came to
the most underground one of all.

418
01:21:38,895 --> 01:21:45,484
And not just a religion,
but also a symptom of the human state.

419
01:21:46,027 --> 01:21:48,404
If the word human still applies.

420
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:54,118
In short, we were lead into contact
with vampirism.

421
01:21:54,994 --> 01:21:57,955
That first contact wasn't exactly
to the vampires' liking...

422
01:21:58,539 --> 01:22:00,666
because we were their sworn enemies.

423
01:22:01,042 --> 01:22:04,337
I think we were the most fearsome

424
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:08,966
and extraordinary vampire hunters
in the whole universe!

425
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:10,968
Our tally was impressive.

426
01:22:11,052 --> 01:22:14,138
- That's right.
- Fantastic.

427
01:22:15,181 --> 01:22:20,603
- Until the day an unfortunate event -
- An accident.

428
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:23,522
An appalling accident.

429
01:22:24,231 --> 01:22:25,566
Yes, appalling.

430
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:29,528
They contaminated us
and made us what we are today.

431
01:22:29,612 --> 01:22:35,493
And so what choice did we have?
We could only accept our new duties.

432
01:22:35,576 --> 01:22:37,244
And we accepted them.

433
01:22:37,912 --> 01:22:39,538
Completely.

434
01:22:39,622 --> 01:22:43,167
So maybe now you can understand,

435
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:46,462
my clear, in light of our sad story,

436
01:22:46,545 --> 01:22:50,383
that our fate is also worthy
of some compassion.

437
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:11,654
The initiation ceremony
will take place tonight.

438
01:23:13,114 --> 01:23:14,824
our Isle,

439
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:19,829
will receive the final kiss,
the final bite,

440
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:23,082
which will allow her to join us.

441
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:16,719
Those monsters terrorise you.

442
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:21,474
I can set you free tonight
and give you back your freedom.

443
01:27:56,230 --> 01:27:58,649
Open the gate. Let me out.

444
01:27:58,732 --> 01:28:00,985
Take that crucifix away.

445
01:28:01,068 --> 01:28:03,320
Let me out, I will die.

446
01:28:03,404 --> 01:28:05,364
Let me out!

447
01:28:12,579 --> 01:28:13,831
Help me!

448
01:31:04,877 --> 01:31:06,670
It will soon be light.

449
01:31:08,088 --> 01:31:09,965
It's time to go back.

450
01:31:10,466 --> 01:31:12,384
We're staying here.

451
01:31:37,493 --> 01:31:41,079
Isle, maybe it's not too late.
I can still save you.

452
01:33:58,467 --> 01:33:59,968
Come back.

453
01:34:07,142 --> 01:34:09,770
Isle, I love you.

454
01:34:50,977 --> 01:34:53,647
I love you, Isle.
