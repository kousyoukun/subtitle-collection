17
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,900
In the 16th century, during the Civil Wars,

18
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,700
an endless cycle of conflict
left the countryside overrun by bandits.

19
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,000
Peaceful peasants lived in terror
of the thunder of approaching hooves...

20
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,000
Take this village too?

21
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,900
Take it! Take it!

22
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,200
Not so fast!

23
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,400
We just took their rice last fall.

24
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,500
They'll have nothing now.

25
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,500
Very well.

26
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,500
We'll return
when that barley's ripe!

27
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,700
Is there no god to protect us?

28
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,200
Land tax, forced labor,
war, drought...

29
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,500
and now bandits!

30
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,600
The gods want us farmers dead!

31
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,600
That's right!
We're better off dead!

32
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,500
What's all this?
Crying won't change anything.

33
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,800
The magistrate can do more
than collect taxes.

34
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,800
We can ask him for help.

35
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
We know all about him!

36
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,300
He shows up after they're gone,
acting big while he surveys the damage.

37
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,600
That's right. He's useless.

38
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:50,100
We might as well hand over
our rice and barley to the bandits

39
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,600
and just hang ourselves!

40
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,500
That'll bring the magistrate
here in a hurry!

41
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,800
We'll kill those bandits.

42
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,800
We'll kill them all.

43
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,100
Never again!
Let's kill 'em all!

44
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,300
Not me!

45
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,200
I couldn't possibly --

46
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,300
That's crazy talk.

47
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,500
So we can kill defeated samurai
but not bandits?

48
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,500
Stop it! This is no time
to fight amongst ourselves.

49
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,700
We don't have a chance against bandits.
And when we lose?

50
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,200
They'll slaughter us all,
down to the last unborn child.

51
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,800
I've had enough!
Better to risk it all

52
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,700
than to live like this.
Kill or be killed!

53
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,400
Rikichi!

54
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,500
The farmer's only choice
is to endure.

55
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,900
We can't defy the powerful.

56
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,400
When the bandits arrive,
we'll greet them meekly

57
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,400
and quietly hand over
all our barley.

58
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,400
We'll plead with them to leave
just enough for us to survive.

59
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,900
" That's all we ask, "
we'll beg on our hands and knees.

60
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,900
What bandit will agree to that?

61
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,400
Have you forgotten how low we had
to stoop for the rice we're eating now?

62
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,900
We should go see the Old Man.

63
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,500
Let him decide what to do.

64
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,300
<i>Consider who
we're dealing with here. </i>

65
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,900
<i>Give a wolf a taste of your leg
and he'll ask for your hand. </i>

66
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,900
<i>Once they have a taste, 
they'll be back in the fall. </i>

67
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,400
<i>- But what if we lose?
- Then we're no worse off!</i>

68
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,900
<i>Without our barley, 
we're doomed anyway!</i>

69
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,300
We fight.

70
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,200
Old Man, that's madness.

71
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,900
We're farmers.
What do we know of battle?

72
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,600
We'll hire samurai.

73
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,100
Whoever heard of farmers
hiring samurai?

74
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,500
I saw it with my own eyes,

75
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,700
when the village you were born in
was torched.

76
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,900
I saw it when we escaped
to this village here.

77
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:59,000
The only village that didn't burn
was the one that hired samurai.

78
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,000
But Old Man, there are
different kinds of villages and villagers.

79
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,700
How are we to feed samurai
when we live on rice gruel?

80
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,100
We'll make do on millet!

81
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,700
Show me a samurai who'll fight
for farmers in return for food!

82
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
They're a proud lot.

83
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,100
Look.

84
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,000
Find hungry samurai.

85
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:27,000
Even bears come down from
the mountains when they're hungry.

86
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,200
How dare you?

87
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,100
You're nothing but a farmer!
I'm still a samurai!

88
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,100
I don't need your charity!

89
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,800
Fool!

90
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,700
What'd I tell you?

91
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
Look, the barley's ripe.

92
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,900
Ten days already
since we left the village.

93
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,500
What do we do?

94
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,100
This barley's early,
not like our mountain barley.

95
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,500
Hey, we're soaked through
to the bone.

96
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,300
Find any cheap, strong
and foolhardy samurai?

97
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,400
Leftovers.

98
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,000
You can have 'em cheap.

99
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,400
That's a laugh!

100
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,000
- What's so funny?
- He's blind.

101
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,000
- What about you, then?
- Not me.

102
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,500
I'd rather eat horseshit.

103
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,100
- Won't get a nose bleed outta him.
- Cleaned him out gambling last night.

104
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,100
Pulled his sword when he lost,
so the three of us beat him up.

105
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,700
Not a drop left in his nose now.

106
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,900
Don't bother.
They only eat millet.

107
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,200
Is that true?
You can't live like that.

108
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,300
Without nourishment
you'll go night-blind.

109
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,400
I've got just four left.

110
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,200
I'll trade 'em all
for a cup of rice.

111
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,400
What do you say?

112
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,800
Damn! What a bunch.

113
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,000
What a waste.

114
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,200
If we still had that rice,
we coulda bought 40 of those.

115
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,300
Shut up!

116
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,300
But it's true, right?

117
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,400
The blockhead's cracking up!

118
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,400
What a show.
Go at it, boys.

119
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,900
Who ever heard
of anything so unfair?

120
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:00,400
We give him his fill of rice
and a free bottle of sake,

121
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,500
and he thanks us
with a beating.

122
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Good for him!

123
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,200
Not like this one
playing possum here.

124
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,800
Say, let's go home.
Let's just go home.

125
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,300
Look at him sobbing.

126
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,200
Misses his wifey.

127
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,400
I'd pay good money
to watch the two of 'em going at it.

128
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,200
Let's hurry
and get back to the village.

129
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,900
Go on home. You can't afford buns,
let alone samurai.

130
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,000
Farmers like us know
good from bad when it comes to seed,

131
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,000
but not when it comes
to samurai.

132
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,000
Besides, we're no match
for the tough ones,

133
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,600
and the only ones interested
are weaklings.

134
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,500
If I lost last night,
it was only because I was starving.

135
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,400
Liar! You had plenty
of money to gamble.

136
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,800
Jerk!

137
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,500
Wanna fight?

138
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,700
It's a fight.

139
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,500
Over here!
Wake up!

140
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,700
Quit that strumming, monk!
It's depressing!

141
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,700
Keep it up, grandpa.
We're on your side.

142
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,200
Rikichi!

143
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,700
Stop it, Manzo!

144
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,100
You said we were going home,
you son of a bitch!

145
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I said we'd go home,
not bargain with bandits!

146
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,300
If we can't hire samurai,
what's left?

147
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,200
It's bargain or nothing!

148
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,800
Fine, have it your way!

149
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,900
But tell me:

150
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,200
If we do strike a bargain,

151
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,600
what have we got
to offer this year?

152
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,600
Are you willing to give 'em
your daughter?

153
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,500
Shino's a fine-Iookin' girl.

154
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,300
What's going on?

155
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,400
There's a thief in that barn.
We raised a ruckus and he ran in to hide.

156
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,900
How many thieves are there?

157
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,200
Just one.

158
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,000
One?

159
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,300
All of you can't take
a single thief?

160
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,300
We don't dare make a move.
He took a kid in there with him.

161
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,300
Says he'll kill him
if we attack.

162
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,100
Listen. Hear him?

163
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,400
Poor thing.

164
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,800
It all happened
in the middle of the night.

165
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,200
Poor kid's been bawling
the better part of a day.

166
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,600
He can barely
make a sound now.

167
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,900
He's only seven.
Imagine how his parents feel.

168
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,800
Who's that samurai
getting his head shaved?

169
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,400
No idea. We asked him for help
and he agreed right away.

170
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,500
Then he asked us
for two rice balls.

171
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,900
He asked a monk to shave his head
and lend him his robes.

172
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,700
No idea what he's up to.

173
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,500
<i>Stay back!
Any closer and I kill the brat!</i>

174
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,600
I'm a monk.

175
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,900
<i>Stay back!</i>

176
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,300
I'm just a monk.
I mean you no harm.

177
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,100
I won't come in.

178
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,400
I just thought the child
must be very hungry.

179
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,000
I've brought some rice balls.

180
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,000
You should eat one yourself.

181
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,100
Won't you have one?

182
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,400
What's wrong?

183
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,300
<i>Throw 'em here!</i>

184
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,200
Here.

185
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,000
My baby!

186
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,200
Even you can't object
to a samurai like that.

187
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,200
Ask him quickly.
It'll be harder in town.

188
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,300
What do you want?

189
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:43,000
My name is Katsushiro Okamoto.
Please make me your disciple!

190
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,100
Disciple?

191
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,100
As you see, I'm a ronin.
The name is Kambei Shimada.

192
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,000
I don't take on disciples.

193
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,900
Get up.
I can't talk to you like this.

194
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,300
I'm begging you --
let me be your disciple.

195
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:05,300
First get off your knees.
We'll talk as we go.

196
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,400
I'm at a loss.

197
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,600
You think far too highly of me.

198
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,500
No, sir --

199
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,500
Just hear me out.

200
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,800
There's nothing special
about me.

201
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,300
I may have seen
my share of battle,

202
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,400
but always on the losing side.

203
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,400
That about sums me up.

204
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,600
Better not to follow
such an unlucky man.

205
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,800
No, I'm determined to follow you
whether you allow me to or not.

206
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,600
I forbid it.

207
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,700
I don't have the means
to travel with an attendant.

208
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,500
Can I help you?

209
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,500
What do you want?

210
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,700
Insolence!

211
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
Stay out of this, little chick.

212
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,800
Are you a samurai?

213
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,600
Damn right I am!

214
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,400
I wonder.

215
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,600
Bastard.

216
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,500
Who was that?

217
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,400
Leave him be.

218
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,600
I beg of you, sir!

219
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,600
You idiot.
Why don't you scram?

220
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:51,800
Stubborn old fool.
They'll eat it and run like last time.

221
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,200
It will never work.

222
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,900
Sir, we could arm the villagers
with bamboo spears.

223
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,700
- I thought of that.
- But, sir --

224
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,800
This isn't a game.

225
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,800
They may be bandits,
but they ride 40 strong.

226
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,700
Two or three samurai
won't suffice.

227
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,600
Defense is more difficult
than offense.

228
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,800
You say there are mountains
behind the village?

229
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,800
Yes.

230
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,700
Passable by horse?

231
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,900
Yes.

232
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,400
Fields in front.

233
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,000
Until those are flooded
with water,

234
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,500
you're open to mounted attack
on four sides.

235
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,600
You need at least four men,
one to guard each side.

236
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,800
Two more to guard the rear.

237
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,100
No matter how frugal
our estimate,

238
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,300
we need seven,
including me.

239
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,700
We can manage
seven somehow.

240
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,600
But the Old Man said four.

241
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,500
It's only three more.

242
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,600
Hold on a second.

243
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,500
I haven't accepted your offer.
I'm only speculating.

244
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:41,400
First of all, it's not easy
to find trustworthy samurai.

245
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:46,700
What's more,
all you have to offer is food.

246
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,500
Only those out to fight
for the hell of it will agree.

247
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:56,200
Besides, I'm sick of fighting.

248
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,400
Age, I suppose.

249
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,800
Good thing
I wasn't born a peasant.

250
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,100
Better to be born a dog.
Goddamn it.

251
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,300
Go ahead -- hang yourself and die!
You're better off dead!

252
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,900
Silence, you lout!

253
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,700
What's it to you?
I'm only telling the truth.

254
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:42,200
What truth? What the hell do you know
of these farmers' suffering?

255
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,000
Don't make me laugh!

256
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,800
Like you would know.

257
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,900
How dare you?

258
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,500
You heard right. If you know,
why don't you help them?

259
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,600
So you wanna fight?

260
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,400
That's enough.

261
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,600
Enough!

262
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,200
Hey, samurai, look at this.

263
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,200
This here's your dinner.

264
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,000
But what do you think
these blockheads eat?

265
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,500
Millet.

266
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,800
They eat millet
to feed you white rice.

267
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,500
This is the best they can offer.
What do you say to that?

268
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,200
- All right, then.
- What?

269
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,800
Quit your jabbering.

270
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,900
I won't let this rice go to waste.

271
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Manzo and the others are back!

272
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,100
Where are Rikichi and Yohei?

273
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,000
They stayed behind.
We still need more samurai.

274
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,500
The samurai are coming?

275
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,700
They sure are.
Seven of 'em.

276
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,200
Seven?

277
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,700
Seven.

278
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,500
I was against it
because you said four, Old Man.

279
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:48,200
I figured we'd need
at least ten.

280
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:53,500
But if I'd said ten,
we'd have ended up with 15.

281
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,100
That's the way it goes.

282
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,600
Old Man, I'm worried.

283
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,900
The village girls will go crazy
over the samurai.

284
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:14,300
If the samurai touch 'em,
all hell will break loose.

285
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,800
Bandits are coming, you fool.

286
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,400
Your head is on the block,

287
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,100
and all you think of
are your whiskers?

288
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,900
Samurai, sir.

289
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:53,300
- You require my services?
- Yes, sir.

290
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,600
Who's to be my opponent?

291
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,500
<i>Katsushiro. </i>

292
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,300
Hide just inside the door.

293
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,200
Strike that ronin as he enters.

294
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,700
Here he comes.

295
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,600
Don't hold back.
Give him a real whack.

296
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,200
Excellent!

297
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,200
Please don't take offense.
I am Kambei Shimada.

298
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,900
We're seeking expert swordsmen
and have no time to waste.

299
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,400
Forgive me.

300
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,300
What's this about?

301
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,300
The reason better be good,
or I'll have to redeem my honor.

302
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:23,000
I humbly beg your pardon.
We only sought to test your skill.

303
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,500
We must soon contend
with a gang of bandits.

304
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,300
I see.
And whose clan do you serve?

305
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:35,900
It pains me to tell you,
but we're fighting for farmers.

306
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,600
- Farmers?
- That's right.

307
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,200
This job affords
no stipend and no reward.

308
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,500
But we can eat our fill
as long as we fight.

309
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,200
This is absurd!

310
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,300
My ambitions
are greater than that.

311
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,300
That's a shame.
Won't you reconsider?

312
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,500
I will not.

313
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:09,800
Sir, we lost a good man there.
Such a fine swordsman.

314
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,500
What's wrong?

315
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:02,100
That one samurai's good,
but how'll the other six be?

316
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,400
Enough of your worrying.

317
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:09,200
How can we know before they get here?
Don't worry till you've seen 'em.

318
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,500
<i>That one there. </i>

319
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,100
Excuse me, samurai, sir.

320
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,200
Just like last time?

321
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,600
Sure.
It's good practice for you.

322
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,700
Surely you jest.

323
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,300
No offense intended.

324
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,100
I'm with you.

325
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,800
But I have to say

326
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,000
that although I understand
the farmers' suffering

327
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,900
and understand
why you would take up their cause,

328
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:09,000
it's your character
that I find most compelling.

329
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,500
In life one finds friends
in the strangest places.

330
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,000
- What is your name?
- Gorobei Katayama.

331
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,200
A name fit for a giant, no?

332
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,700
Yohei, what are you doing?
Hurry and wash the rice.

333
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,600
Yohei!

334
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,700
What's wrong?

335
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,500
Someone stole the rice.

336
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,800
You idiot!
Didn't I warn you?

337
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,800
I was so careful.

338
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:22,000
I slept the whole night
hugging that rice jar.

339
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,100
Fine, then!
I'll get more from home!

340
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,900
But what'll we do

341
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,300
till you get back?

342
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:38,800
There's only a handful left.

343
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,100
Stop that, you idiot!

344
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,100
Hide that money.
The master's returning.

345
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,300
I ran into you
at just the right time.

346
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:53,200
So you're still alive.
I figured you'd long since left this earth.

347
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,500
Now tell me,
what happened after that?

348
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,300
I hid among the grasses
in the moat until dark.

349
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:14,600
When the outer walls tumbled down
on me in flames, I knew I was finished.

350
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,100
What ran through your mind
at that moment?

351
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,900
Nothing special.

352
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,100
Sick of fighting yet?

353
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:42,100
Truth is, there's a tough battle ahead
leading to neither money nor rank.

354
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,600
Will you join us?
- Yes.

355
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,700
This may be the one
that kills us.

356
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,600
Where are they
when you need 'em?

357
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,900
What do you need, sir?

358
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,200
Samurai.

359
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:21,400
There's a pretty poor excuse for one
in my backyard.

360
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:25,200
I couldn't believe his gumption.

361
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,200
He says,
"I'm hungry. Feed me.

362
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,500
I'm broke, though,
so I'll pay you by chopping wood. "

363
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:41,200
I like his frankness.

364
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,800
Never seen a man
split wood before?

365
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,500
Sure, but you do it
with such relish.

366
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:30,600
It's just my nature.
Sorry if it bothers you.

367
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,700
You're very good.

368
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,300
It's nothing compared
to how I cut down men.

369
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,900
- Have you cut down many?
- That I have.

370
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,900
There's no cutting me off
when I start cutting.

371
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,500
So I make it a point
to run away first.

372
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,100
A most excellent approach.

373
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,500
Why, thank you kindly.

374
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:11,600
Tell me, do you feel like
cutting down 30 bandits?

375
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,200
Let us commence!

376
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,300
Too bad.

377
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,700
It's a draw.

378
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,400
I'm afraid not.

379
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:08,900
I won.

380
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,700
That's ridiculous!

381
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,200
If these were steel,
you'd be dead now.

382
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,400
- Then we fight with steel!
- Don't throw your life away.

383
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,300
What?

384
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,800
Don't you see?
With steel blades, you'd die.

385
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,500
It's a waste of your life.

386
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,100
Wait! Don't try to flee.

387
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:40,700
Draw! This isn't
a contest of words!

388
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:20,800
This is preposterous.

389
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,100
There's no contest.

390
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,600
How did you fare?

391
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,600
We let a good fish get away.
An excellent swordsman.

392
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,200
They say the fish that gets away
looks bigger than it really is.

393
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,600
No.

394
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:14,200
I watched him cut a man down
with my own eyes.

395
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,800
It was amazing.

396
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:27,200
A man obsessed only
with testing the limits of his skill.

397
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,800
I doubt he'll join us.

398
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,400
- That's a shame.
- Indeed.

399
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,600
I did tell him
where we're staying, though.

400
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,800
And how did you fare?

401
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,200
- Caught one.
- I see.

402
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,800
- As a swordsman, barely mediocre.
- Barely mediocre?

403
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:49,300
But an honest, amusing man.

404
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,200
Something about him
brightens one's spirits.

405
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,100
He'll be a treasure in hard times.

406
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,800
Much obliged.

407
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,800
Actually, I did land one myself.
- The one dressed as a peddler?

408
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,100
That's right.

409
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,900
In fact, he's an old trusted friend.

410
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,800
I'll bring some water.

411
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,600
I'm Heihachi Hayashida.

412
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,700
A modest warrior
of the Wood-Chop School.

413
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:33,600
Just three more to go.

414
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,100
Three? Don't you mean two?

415
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,800
No, we can't afford
to take a child along.

416
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,200
Master!

417
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,400
I know, I know.

418
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,200
I know what you'll say.

419
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,600
I was once your age, you know.

420
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,700
Hone your skills,

421
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:57,200
then go to war
and do great things.

422
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:01,400
Then become lord
of your own castle and domain.

423
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,700
But as you dream those dreams,
before you know it,

424
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,000
your hair will turn
as gray as mine.

425
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:15,700
By that time

426
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:19,400
you've lost your parents
and you're all alone.

427
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,600
Tomorrow you go home.

428
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,500
You've learned a lot
these four or five days.

429
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:14,600
You have
fine stories to tell.

430
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:34,200
Please, sir.
I beg you to let him come along.

431
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,400
Why not let him come?
You call him a kid, but --

432
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,900
Actually,

433
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,200
kids work harder than adults.

434
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,800
But only if you treat them
like adults.

435
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,900
Then let's treat him
like an adult.

436
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,100
That means only two more.

437
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:01,400
Actually just one, it seems.

438
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,000
You wish to join us?

439
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,200
I'm very grateful.

440
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,400
- When do we depart?
- Tomorrow.

441
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,200
Tomorrow?

442
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:26,000
This is enough. We don't have time
to find the last one.

443
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,400
All right, then.

444
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,300
Master!

445
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,000
Master!
- All right.

446
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:42,200
- Master!
- All right! That's enough of that!

447
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:49,900
Hey, I just found
a real tough samurai.

448
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:52,400
There was a huge fight.
They were no match for him.

449
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,200
Never seen anything like it.
He's like a wild dog.

450
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,400
Someone stopped the fight.
They started drinking.

451
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,200
I told him about you.

452
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,200
He's on his way.

453
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,600
Shall we give him the usual?

454
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,300
What are you doing?

455
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,400
Testing him.

456
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:27,400
That's a dirty trick!

457
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,100
Hey, samurai!
- Just shut up and watch.

458
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,300
A true samurai won't get hit.

459
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,200
But this guy's drunk!

460
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,200
A samurai never drinks
enough to dull his wits.

461
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,700
I told you!
You guys are nuts.

462
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:57,600
What the --

463
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,300
Who the hell hit me?

464
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,700
You?

465
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:30,000
Who hit me?

466
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,300
You?

467
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,000
Damn bastard!

468
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,300
You again!

469
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:18,400
I see that bald head of yours
in my dreams!

470
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,900
Hey, you.

471
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,600
How dare you even ask me
if I'm a samurai!

472
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,200
You got some nerve!

473
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:32,900
Don't mess with me.

474
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:43,200
I may look like hell,
but I'm a real samurai!

475
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:51,200
I've been looking for you
ever since that day.

476
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,500
Wanted you to see this.

477
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,500
Look at this!

478
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:09,700
This is my family tree.
All my ancestors are here.

479
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:15,900
Damn you, trying to make
a fool outta me. Screw you.

480
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,100
Looky here.

481
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,500
Making a fool outta me.

482
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,400
My honorable self
is right here.

483
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,900
So this Kikuchiyo here
would be you?

484
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,900
That is correct.

485
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:41,400
" Kikuchiyo,
born February 17, 1574. "

486
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,600
What's so damned funny?

487
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,800
You hardly look
13 years old to me.

488
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:54,700
If you are in fact
the Kikuchiyo listed here,

489
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,800
you'd now be precisely
13 years old.

490
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:05,000
Where'd you steal
this family tree?

491
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:09,000
Steal it? Shit!

492
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,600
Damn jerks.

493
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,800
To hell with samurai.

494
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,400
To hell with samurai!

495
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,700
Hey, you bastard!

496
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,800
Come back here!

497
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,200
Goddamn it,
you son of a bitch!

498
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,800
What's wrong, teenager?
Here you are.

499
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,100
Damn you!

500
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,700
Come back here!

501
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,600
What's wrong, Lord Kikuchiyo?

502
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,500
What's the matter, junior?

503
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,700
Screw samurai!

504
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:07,900
- Is he really a samurai?
- In his own mind, anyway.

505
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,000
<i>Take me too!</i>

506
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,300
Hey, Kikuchiyo.

507
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,900
Guard your treasure.

508
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,700
Let me go too!

509
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,500
What is it, Father?

510
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,800
What is it?

511
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:41,900
What are you staring at?

512
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:53,600
Shino, cut off your hair.

513
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,400
Cut your hair
and dress like a man.

514
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,100
- What are you talking about?
- Just cut it off!

515
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:06,000
It's only because I love you.
No telling what those samurai'll do!

516
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,200
No!

517
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,700
No, I won't!

518
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:15,600
Shino!

519
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:41,700
He's a fool.

520
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:45,300
But Manzo knows those samurai
better than anyone.

521
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,600
If he cut off his daughter's hair,
he must have good reason.

522
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:51,000
You've only got sons,
so you're safe, but we --

523
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,700
Goddamn it!
Now I understand.

524
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:57,800
So you agree to hide my daughter
at your place across the bridge?

525
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,900
Idiot! I meant that I see
what Manzo's up to.

526
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:07,300
That rascal doesn't care about the village,
only about his daughter.

527
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:09,100
Damn him!

528
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,300
Look what you've done!

529
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,900
Now the whole village is crazed.

530
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:35,300
Every family
with a girl's gone mad.

531
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:39,200
How do you plan
to set this right?

532
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,200
The samurai will show up
any day now.

533
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:46,000
Come on.
We're seeing the Old Man.

534
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:51,100
There's nothing to see here!
Go home!

535
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,800
Go home!

536
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:59,100
We can't let the samurai
see us like this.

537
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:07,900
He's still following us.

538
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,200
Where did Kikuchiyo go?

539
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:57,900
Think he gave up?

540
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,800
It's funny.

541
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,200
Now that he's gone,
it's almost a little...

542
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,400
Ionely.

543
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:11,900
This way.

544
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:16,200
Oh, hell!

545
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,700
So that's our castle, eh?

546
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:35,600
No way I'm gonna die
in that dungheap.

547
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:38,300
No one asked you to.

548
01:07:56,700 --> 01:08:00,600
We're back!
The samurai have arrived!

549
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,600
The samurai are here!

550
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:16,000
What's wrong with you?
The samurai are here!

551
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:24,100
Hey, what's wrong?

552
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,000
What's the matter?

553
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,300
This is a fine welcome.

554
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
What's the meaning of this?

555
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:58,800
Hey, what's going on?
The samurai have arrived!

556
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,300
- We'll go see the Old Man.
- The Old Man?

557
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:20,500
Whatever happens in the village,
the Old Man --

558
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:22,700
He's the village elder?

559
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:28,700
An audience with the village elder.
This is truly an honor.

560
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,200
Well, let's go.

561
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:51,500
I know they're being foolish.

562
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:55,800
All farmers ever do is worry,

563
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,800
whether the rain falls,
the sun shines, or the wind blows.

564
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,200
In short,

565
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:07,400
all they know is fear.

566
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:11,400
Their behavior today...

567
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,500
is also due simply to fear.

568
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:24,300
But Old Man,
why do the villagers fear us?

569
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:29,100
What can they expect from us
under such circumstances?

570
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,500
Samurai, sirs!

571
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,700
Samurai, please!

572
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:24,900
Quiet down!

573
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:28,200
Don't panic. Calm down.

574
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,600
I want clear answers.

575
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:34,100
Where are the bandits
coming from?

576
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:37,500
- The mountains!
- No, the road!

577
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,000
Who saw the bandits?
Come forward.

578
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:46,500
No one saw any bandits?

579
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:49,200
Then who sounded the alarm?

580
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:50,600
<i>I did!</i>

581
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:59,500
Outta the way.

582
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:06,600
What's with the faces?

583
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:11,000
Don't worry.
No bandits have come.

584
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:18,000
Hey, blockheads.

585
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:21,900
Remember how you welcomed us
when we got here?

586
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,900
But as soon as I bang on this,

587
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:28,500
" Samurai, sirs!
Samurai, please!"

588
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:31,200
You're practically groveling!

589
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:38,700
Got what you deserved,
you mud snails.

590
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,900
Got a problem, gramps?

591
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:00,400
Nope.

592
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,900
All's well now.

593
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:11,200
Looks like he's good
for something after all.

594
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:14,000
There are seven of us at last.

595
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:23,200
Sorry it's so dirty.

596
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:27,300
But where will you sleep
if we take your home?

597
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:31,000
- In the barn.
- With your horse?

598
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:35,400
The bandits
got my horse last year.

599
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,400
A barn's not so bad
with a wife to snuggle up to.

600
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,800
I don't have a wife!

601
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:04,800
What's the matter, you fool?

602
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,900
Jerk.

603
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:34,100
By the way,
what's your real name?

604
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,800
I don't remember.

605
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,600
Give me a new one that fits.

606
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:43,300
Then Kikuchiyo it is.

607
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,600
Fits you perfectly.

608
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:11,500
How would you attack
this village?

609
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:14,300
I'd charge from this mountain.

610
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:18,000
I agree.
Along this road.

611
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,700
WEST

612
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,600
And what's the best defense?

613
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:41,000
Shichiroji knows what to do.

614
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:45,100
See these logs?
He'll make a fence to block the horses.

615
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:47,800
Indeed.
Your trusty right-hand man.

616
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:17,900
All right!

617
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,200
Listen.

618
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:23,300
Nothing forces you to run
like a battle.

619
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:26,700
You run when you attack,
you run when you retreat.

620
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:29,200
When you can't run anymore,
you die.

621
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:50,200
SOUTH

622
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:07,200
We'll flood these fields
after they harvest the barley.

623
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:12,100
That'll make a good defense.
But will we have time?

624
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:13,600
Indeed.

625
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,700
Charge!

626
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:27,800
Pretend I'm a bandit
and stab me.

627
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,400
Charge!

628
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,300
Come on!

629
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:47,700
<i>Next. </i>

630
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:51,000
<i>Next. </i>

631
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:53,400
What's wrong with all of you?

632
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:20,600
EAST

633
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:28,700
Destroying this bridge
will foil an assault from the east.

634
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:38,900
But what about the houses
on the other side?

635
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:48,800
They'll have to evacuate those.

636
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,300
And the mill?

637
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:00,400
The Old Man's
not going to go quietly.

638
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:09,500
Listen now.
The enemy is scary.

639
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:11,600
Everybody's scared.

640
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:15,200
But the other side's
scared of us too.

641
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,200
Just great.

642
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:49,900
You all make great scarecrows.

643
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:56,200
Problem is, the enemy
isn't a bunch of sparrows and crows!

644
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:08,300
You there, chewing your cud.
Can you cut that out?

645
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,500
This isn't a cow shed!

646
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:20,200
Look at the bunch of you.

647
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,800
Shit!

648
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,700
First in line, step forward!

649
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:32,100
I'm talking to you!

650
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:33,900
You!

651
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:57,400
<i>Look here! You gotta pay
a mon each to watch the show!</i>

652
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:18,000
What's this?

653
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,000
- A spear, sir.
- Idiot.

654
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,900
Where the hell
did you get it?

655
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,300
Did it sprout up in those hills?

656
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:32,200
I know perfectly well.

657
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,800
You hunted down retreating warriors
and took their weapons.

658
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:38,800
If you've got one,
you must have more.

659
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,300
Fess up, damn it!

660
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,600
NORTH

661
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,200
What a peaceful grove.
But it's also a death trap.

662
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,500
Katsushiro.

663
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:48,100
We're going.
- I'll be right there.

664
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:58,000
As I said,
he's still a child.

665
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:02,400
Are you from the village?

666
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:08,300
Are you a girl?

667
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:14,300
A boy?

668
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:18,100
Then where's your spear?

669
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:21,700
Is this any time for an able-bodied man
to be picking flowers?

670
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:24,900
Come here!
I'll teach you.

671
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:26,900
Come here!

672
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:32,900
Why, you!

673
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:40,600
This is fine, and this too.

674
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,700
But this is a problem.

675
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:45,800
<i>Heave ho! Heave ho!</i>

676
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:51,100
Get back, the rest of you!

677
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:54,200
Stand up straight!

678
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:01,200
What a haul!

679
01:27:07,700 --> 01:27:09,000
What's all this?

680
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:11,600
Plunder from defeated warriors.

681
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:15,100
Where did you find it?

682
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:18,300
Here in the village?
- Yep, over at Manzo's.

683
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:29,600
What's the matter?

684
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:33,400
Don't you like 'em?

685
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,100
This is good stuff.

686
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:41,300
What's wrong?

687
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:44,900
You said you wanted armor,
spears and bows. Now you got 'em.

688
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:47,500
Bastard!
You call yourself a samurai?

689
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:51,800
Those farmers killed samurai
to get these.

690
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,900
- I know that.
- Then why the hell --

691
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:56,000
That's enough!

692
01:27:57,300 --> 01:28:01,000
You can't understand
unless you've been hunted.

693
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:16,500
It's nothing.
Get outta here.

694
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:44,700
Now I want to kill them all.

695
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:00,500
Well, that's just fine and dandy!

696
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:07,500
What did ya think
these farmers were anyway?

697
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:10,200
Buddhas or something?

698
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:12,300
Don't make me laugh!

699
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:15,000
There's no creature on earth
as wily as a farmer!

700
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:23,700
Ask 'em for rice, barley,
anything,

701
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:26,200
and all they ever say is,
"We're all out. "

702
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:32,000
But they've got it.
They've got everything.

703
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:36,900
Dig under the floorboards.
If it's not there, try the barn.

704
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:42,600
You'll find plenty.
Jars of rice, salt, beans, sake!

705
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:50,800
Go up in the mountains.
They have hidden fields.

706
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:54,000
They kowtow and lie,
playing innocent the whole time.

707
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:56,600
You name it,
they'll cheat you on it!

708
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:59,800
After a battle, they hunt down
the losers with their spears.

709
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:03,400
Listen to me!

710
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:07,100
Farmers are misers, weasels,

711
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:08,500
and crybabies!

712
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:11,100
They're mean, stupid

713
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:13,100
murderers!

714
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:16,400
Damn!
I could laugh till I cry!

715
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,800
But tell me this:
Who turned them into such monsters?

716
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,500
You did!
You samurai did!

717
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:29,700
Damn you to hell!

718
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:38,400
In war, you burn their villages,

719
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:41,700
trample their fields,
steal their food,

720
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:45,500
work them like slaves,
rape their women,

721
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:47,400
and kill 'em if they resist.

722
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:49,400
What do you expect 'em to do?

723
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,900
What the hell are farmers
supposed to do?

724
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:54,600
Damn it! Goddamn it!

725
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:36,000
You were born a farmer,
weren't you?

726
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:16,900
What is it now?

727
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:21,000
Nothing at all.
Everything's fine.

728
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:28,300
It's me.

729
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:30,600
I'm sleeping here
from now on.

730
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,500
Those guys cramp my style.

731
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:38,300
Idiot! Stop cowering!

732
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
This is your place!

733
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:44,300
You hand over your house
and sleep in a barn,

734
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:46,400
and still you can't stand up
for yourself.

735
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,100
Get to sleep!

736
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:06,600
Brings back memories.

737
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Sure is quiet.

738
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:35,200
On a day like this, it's hard
to imagine bandits on that mountain.

739
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:40,200
Damn it all,
I need a girl!

740
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:50,500
- Where are you going?
- The hills.

741
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:52,800
- The hills?
- To practice.

742
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:56,100
No girls up there.

743
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:00,500
Sometimes you really
hit the nail on the head.

744
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:04,000
What are you making there?

745
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:06,100
- A flag.
- A flag?

746
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:12,500
It doesn't feel right in battle
without a banner to raise high.

747
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:19,000
What do the symbols mean?

748
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:24,000
This represents a field:
That is, the farmers and this village.

749
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:27,300
- And those circles?
- Those are us.

750
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:30,900
There's only six.
You leaving me out?

751
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:34,200
No, this triangle's Lord Kikuchiyo.

752
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,300
That's a good one!

753
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:59,100
It's real rice.

754
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:01,300
Go ahead. Eat.
- But --

755
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:03,700
Rikichi gave me some millet.

756
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:08,200
I could barely get it down.

757
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:12,000
Go ahead. Eat.

758
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:24,700
Hurry up and eat.

759
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:26,800
If you're embarrassed, I'll go.

760
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,800
I'm not going to eat it.

761
01:37:29,100 --> 01:37:31,200
Why not?
I went to a lot of trouble.

762
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:33,400
No, I just --

763
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:39,900
I know you did, so I'll take it
to Kyuemon's grandma.

764
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:42,900
Kyuemon's grandma?

765
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:07,800
Rikichi, I'm full.
I'll save the rest for later.

766
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:10,900
Go ahead and eat.

767
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:13,100
Take my leftovers this time.

768
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:17,700
What's this?
What are you up to?

769
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:19,400
What's going on?

770
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:29,300
How terrible.

771
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:34,900
Doesn't she have family?
- The bandits got them all.

772
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:42,800
I...

773
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:48,500
want to die quickly.

774
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:52,900
I want to die soon

775
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:57,300
and leave this suffering behind.

776
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:01,300
But you know...

777
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:06,300
the other world may be

778
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:10,600
just as full of suffering
as this one.

779
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:14,200
It's not.

780
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:18,700
In that world
there's no war and no bandits.

781
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:21,300
There's no suffering there,
grandma.

782
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:25,100
How the hell would you know?
Have you been there?

783
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:27,000
Why the hell
are you always screaming?

784
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:28,900
I hate wimps.

785
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:31,800
Worms like her make me sick!

786
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:36,400
Pissing and grumbling
about everything.

787
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:40,900
Shit!
I want to do something wild!

788
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:45,000
Save your spit and fire
for the bandits.

789
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:02,600
Excuse me.

790
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:07,700
Excuse me, but why did you --

791
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,700
You saw us today, didn't you?

792
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:13,300
Me and the --

793
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:15,400
- The girl?
- Yes.

794
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:20,200
Why didn't you --
- Tell them? You want me to?

795
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:39,800
We want rice!
White rice!

796
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:48,200
You little brats!
There's no rice!

797
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:55,900
Quit yapping!

798
01:40:56,100 --> 01:41:01,100
If you've got the strength
to scream, "We want rice!"

799
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:03,700
Then you don't need it!

800
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:06,900
Listen here,
you little piss pants.

801
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,200
This is all the rice there is.

802
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:14,600
If we give you any more,
we'll get all --

803
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:19,800
That's how it is.

804
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,700
Say, any of you got
a pretty sister?

805
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:29,900
How about you?
You got one?

806
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:33,700
So, Old Man,
when is the harvest?

807
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:37,900
In ten days.

808
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:40,400
How quickly can you do it?

809
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:45,300
No less than three days.

810
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:48,300
We'll flood the fields
when you're done.

811
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:52,400
You see, we want to create
a moat to the south of the village.

812
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:54,700
It'll keep the horses out.

813
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:58,200
We don't need all the fields.
One patch per family will do.

814
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,900
Then...

815
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:04,800
it'll take at least a day to flatten
the paths and draw the water.

816
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,300
Understood.

817
01:42:07,700 --> 01:42:09,900
There's one other thing.

818
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:16,700
You need to leave the houses this side
of the bridge, and the mill too.

819
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:19,600
Father!

820
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:22,000
You want us to move out?

821
01:42:29,300 --> 01:42:31,600
I know it's tough.

822
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:35,400
But there's no choice.

823
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,900
We can't possibly protect
the outlying houses.

824
01:43:02,100 --> 01:43:05,400
Listen carefully. You'll soon
begin harvesting the barley.

825
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:07,600
The bandits will come
when you're done.

826
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:09,700
We have to assume that.

827
01:43:09,900 --> 01:43:13,600
Therefore we prepare
for battle as we harvest.

828
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:17,600
We'll harvest not as families
but as squads.

829
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:22,400
Starting tomorrow,
each squad will live and work as one.

830
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:27,400
Understood? Starting tomorrow,
nobody acts on his own.

831
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:30,600
Hey, everybody.

832
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:36,200
Give your wives
plenty of lovin' tonight, you hear?

833
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:59,800
This is all a load of crap!

834
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,800
Everyone from across the bridge,
follow me.

835
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:07,500
Throw down your spears.

836
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:11,800
Why should we abandon
our homes to protect theirs?

837
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:16,200
That's right.
We'll protect our homes ourselves.

838
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:19,900
Stop!

839
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:24,900
Pick up your spears!

840
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:27,000
Return to your line!

841
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:55,100
Fall in!

842
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,300
Squad formation!

843
01:45:01,300 --> 01:45:03,700
Where's Yohei gone?

844
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:06,800
Where the hell's Yohei?

845
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:15,400
There you are, you idiot!

846
01:45:33,100 --> 01:45:35,300
There are three outlying houses,

847
01:45:36,100 --> 01:45:38,100
but 20 in the village.

848
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:43,000
We can't risk 20
to save three.

849
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:48,500
And if this village is destroyed,

850
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:51,600
those three cannot survive
on their own.

851
01:45:55,700 --> 01:45:59,200
Is that clear?
This is the nature of war:

852
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:03,500
By protecting others,
you save yourself.

853
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:08,000
If you only think of yourself,

854
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:10,600
you'll only destroy yourself.

855
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:17,500
From this day forward,
anyone caught doing that...

856
01:52:49,400 --> 01:52:51,000
Hot damn!

857
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:53,000
Look at all those girls!

858
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:54,600
Hey, Yohei!

859
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:03,000
Where the hell
have you been hiding these girls?

860
01:53:07,300 --> 01:53:09,000
You devil.

861
01:53:16,900 --> 01:53:19,100
Hey, lend me your scythe.

862
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:22,400
I'll cut three times your share.

863
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:25,600
In return,
we get nice and friendly, eh?

864
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:50,900
- Rikichi.
- Yes.

865
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:55,800
It seems the married couples
are the most productive.

866
01:53:56,500 --> 01:53:58,700
Time you got yourself a wife.

867
01:54:02,100 --> 01:54:06,200
Why do you always get so mad?
I just said you should --

868
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:09,700
Katsushiro, go after him.

869
01:54:09,900 --> 01:54:12,000
Running off at a time like this.

870
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:14,600
Rikichi!

871
01:54:15,700 --> 01:54:17,100
Rikichi!

872
01:54:21,300 --> 01:54:24,000
Shino, what are you gawking at?

873
01:54:40,100 --> 01:54:43,300
What's this? A bear's den?

874
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:47,500
This was done with a scythe.

875
01:54:49,600 --> 01:54:50,900
Was it Rikichi?

876
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:54,000
Yes, though I didn't actually
see him do it.

877
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:56,400
I lost him for a while,

878
01:54:56,600 --> 01:54:58,500
but then I spotted him
leaving this grove.

879
01:54:58,700 --> 01:55:01,800
He was furious,
soaked in sweat.

880
01:55:05,400 --> 01:55:07,100
What did you say to him?

881
01:55:07,300 --> 01:55:10,700
Nothing. Just that he should
hurry up and find a wife.

882
01:55:14,100 --> 01:55:18,200
Something's upsetting the little bugger,
but he won't say what.

883
01:55:18,700 --> 01:55:21,100
You can see it
all over his face.

884
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:27,500
Those lips of his
are bolted up tight as a house.

885
01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:30,100
Why don't you try to open them up?

886
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:38,400
Who's there?

887
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:39,800
<i>It's me. </i>

888
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:44,700
All clear?
- Yes.

889
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:56,100
Have a seat.
Let's have a little chat.

890
01:56:01,300 --> 01:56:04,800
I think talking...

891
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:07,400
is a good thing.

892
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:11,900
Whatever your burden may be,
talking can ease it.

893
01:56:15,200 --> 01:56:19,100
You, for example,
seem pretty tight-lipped,

894
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:24,200
but if you're suffering,
you shouldn't bottle it up.

895
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:31,400
Letting out your feelings
bit by bit can work wonders.

896
01:56:32,700 --> 01:56:35,400
I've got nothing to say.

897
01:56:52,900 --> 01:56:54,700
Time to head out.

898
01:56:57,300 --> 01:56:58,300
Shall we wake him?

899
01:56:58,500 --> 01:57:00,700
No, let the kid sleep.

900
01:57:04,700 --> 01:57:06,100
Shino.

901
01:57:08,900 --> 01:57:10,900
I swear he just said " Shino. "

902
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,800
Sounds like a woman's name.

903
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,800
Even kids can be charmers
in their dreams.

904
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:27,700
Where shall we start our rounds?

905
01:57:27,900 --> 01:57:31,100
The place that worries us most,
of course.

906
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:30,000
Who's there?

907
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:38,300
Who's there?

908
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:40,500
Come out here!

909
01:58:41,300 --> 01:58:42,200
Who's there?

910
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:43,800
Kikuchiyo.

911
01:58:46,200 --> 01:58:48,300
You're lucky it was us.

912
01:58:48,700 --> 01:58:51,800
If we'd been bandits,
you'd be headless right now.

913
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:25,300
Yohei.

914
01:59:26,700 --> 01:59:28,400
What's this?

915
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:30,900
That's my horse, sir.

916
01:59:33,200 --> 01:59:36,000
I thought it was a big old mouse.

917
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:19,600
<i>The sparrows chirp, chirp, chirp</i>

918
02:00:20,600 --> 02:00:24,300
<i>The crows caw, caw, caw</i>

919
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:31,400
I wonder why
the bandits aren't coming.

920
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:39,200
What a waste if they don't.
Think how much we feed those samurai.

921
02:00:39,400 --> 02:00:43,200
Idiot!
It's best if they don't come!

922
02:00:49,700 --> 02:00:53,000
A nag like that
can't carry your weight!

923
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:56,400
Yohei's horse is too worn out.

924
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:01,600
Please stop. Yohei'll be in tears
if you break its leg.

925
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:05,300
A skilled horseman
can make even a nag soar into the sky.

926
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:18,600
Not bad.

927
02:01:34,400 --> 02:01:36,300
Very fine indeed!

928
02:02:00,300 --> 02:02:02,400
They seem to be having fun.

929
02:02:03,900 --> 02:02:06,800
The threshing's done,
and still no bandits.

930
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:10,600
Everyone's saying
they might not come after all.

931
02:02:11,900 --> 02:02:14,100
A tempting thought.

932
02:02:14,600 --> 02:02:19,800
But when you think you're safe
is precisely when you're most vulnerable.

933
02:02:21,100 --> 02:02:23,600
Send them back
to their posts.

934
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:00,800
I wish I'd been born
into a samurai family.

935
02:03:03,900 --> 02:03:05,800
A farmer's life is too cruel.

936
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:10,000
My life has been so easy,
I'm ashamed.

937
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:12,500
That's not what I meant.

938
02:03:12,900 --> 02:03:17,400
It's because you're a samurai
and I'm a farmer.

939
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:19,000
But I don't --

940
02:03:19,200 --> 02:03:22,400
It's all right. I don't mind.
We can't know

941
02:03:22,600 --> 02:03:24,800
what the future holds!

942
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:01,200
Coward!
Act like a samurai!

943
02:05:08,300 --> 02:05:11,000
Three suspicious characters
on the western road.

944
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:16,200
- The villagers haven't noticed?
- Not yet.

945
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:18,500
We can't have them
sounding the alarm.

946
02:05:20,900 --> 02:05:23,800
I saw three horses
up in the hills.

947
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,900
I think they're bandits.
- We know.

948
02:05:31,600 --> 02:05:33,800
- So they're here.
- How did you know?

949
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:37,200
How could I not?
This one here was in such a panic.

950
02:05:40,600 --> 02:05:43,200
Where are they coming from?
The mountains or the west?

951
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:47,100
The west.

952
02:05:55,700 --> 02:05:56,600
Bandits!

953
02:06:01,200 --> 02:06:04,200
Send everyone to their houses.
There are only three of them.

954
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:07,200
Tell them to keep quiet
no matter what.

955
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:11,800
They're probably scouts.
We can't let them see any samurai.

956
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,100
What is it?

957
02:06:31,500 --> 02:06:33,300
Bandits?

958
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Bandits, eh?
Where are they?

959
02:06:50,600 --> 02:06:51,900
Quiet!

960
02:06:53,900 --> 02:06:55,700
Where are they, Shichiroji?

961
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,700
Beyond the fence.

962
02:07:13,100 --> 02:07:15,600
No doubt about it -- they're scouts.

963
02:07:16,200 --> 02:07:18,100
The fence took them by surprise.

964
02:07:19,200 --> 02:07:21,600
They don't seem
to realize we're here.

965
02:07:21,700 --> 02:07:24,900
With luck they'll report
there are only farmers here.

966
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:29,000
<i>Hey, where is everyone?</i>

967
02:07:29,200 --> 02:07:30,900
That idiot!

968
02:07:31,900 --> 02:07:33,800
Kikuchiyo!

969
02:07:40,100 --> 02:07:42,400
Hey, I hear the bandits are here.

970
02:07:44,100 --> 02:07:44,900
You fool.

971
02:07:45,100 --> 02:07:47,400
Too late.
They've seen us.

972
02:07:58,300 --> 02:08:01,700
If they report back that samurai
are here, we're finished.

973
02:08:02,600 --> 02:08:05,700
I'll kill them.
The mountain's my territory.

974
02:08:06,100 --> 02:08:07,100
I was just --

975
02:08:07,300 --> 02:08:11,100
Enough. You can make up for it
by getting one.

976
02:08:11,300 --> 02:08:12,600
Head them off at --

977
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:15,700
I know, at their horses.
Take us there.

978
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:18,400
Katsushiro!

979
02:08:19,300 --> 02:08:21,800
Just watch, you understand?

980
02:08:28,900 --> 02:08:31,100
Those are some horses!

981
02:08:35,900 --> 02:08:37,800
Wait in this hollow.

982
02:08:46,600 --> 02:08:49,400
- What do you plan to do?
- Who, me?

983
02:10:49,700 --> 02:10:51,800
Katsushiro.

984
02:10:52,700 --> 02:10:54,900
You can come out now.

985
02:10:58,200 --> 02:11:00,100
Help me!

986
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:20,900
Back off!

987
02:11:22,200 --> 02:11:26,500
He's a captive who has confessed.
He's begging for his life.

988
02:11:26,700 --> 02:11:30,100
You can't just
chop him to pieces.

989
02:11:31,400 --> 02:11:32,600
Stay out of this!

990
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:36,600
Let me do it! Scum!

991
02:11:54,700 --> 02:11:56,400
All right.

992
02:11:56,900 --> 02:11:59,500
Let her avenge her son's death.

993
02:12:01,900 --> 02:12:04,600
Someone help her!

994
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:06,400
I'll do it!

995
02:12:15,300 --> 02:12:19,100
- That bandit said their fort --
- It's hardly a fort.

996
02:12:19,300 --> 02:12:23,100
It's full of holes,
like Yohei's underwear.

997
02:12:23,300 --> 02:12:25,600
- Easy to sneak in.
- Let's attack at night.

998
02:12:25,800 --> 02:12:29,400
They have 40 men.
We'd usually pick off a few first.

999
02:12:29,600 --> 02:12:32,500
Wait. We can't afford
to lose a single man,

1000
02:12:32,700 --> 02:12:35,100
even if we kill five
for every one lost.

1001
02:12:35,300 --> 02:12:39,800
- War is always a gamble.
- Three of us can take 10 of them.

1002
02:12:40,900 --> 02:12:42,400
Rikichi.

1003
02:12:42,600 --> 02:12:45,500
How far away is their hideout?

1004
02:12:45,700 --> 02:12:47,200
At least a day.

1005
02:12:47,400 --> 02:12:50,200
Hey, we've got
three of their horses.

1006
02:12:50,400 --> 02:12:52,400
Half a day by horse.

1007
02:13:05,500 --> 02:13:07,100
Very well. Let's do it.

1008
02:13:07,300 --> 02:13:10,200
If we leave now,
we'll arrive before dawn.

1009
02:13:10,400 --> 02:13:12,100
But who should go?

1010
02:13:15,300 --> 02:13:16,500
Not you.

1011
02:13:19,200 --> 02:13:21,500
And me makes three.

1012
02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:24,300
They need a guide!

1013
02:13:24,500 --> 02:13:26,900
There aren't enough horses.

1014
02:13:27,100 --> 02:13:29,100
There's Yohei's horse.
You ride that.

1015
02:13:29,300 --> 02:13:31,500
The only man
to master that steed

1016
02:13:31,600 --> 02:13:33,200
is Lord Kikuchiyo himself.

1017
02:13:42,300 --> 02:13:44,500
Whoa! What the hell?

1018
02:13:45,300 --> 02:13:47,500
It's the other way!

1019
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:51,800
Stupid horse!

1020
02:13:52,500 --> 02:13:56,400
This way, you useless mule!

1021
02:13:57,200 --> 02:13:59,700
You call yourself a horse?

1022
02:13:59,900 --> 02:14:02,000
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

1023
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:05,800
Hey, wait!

1024
02:14:08,100 --> 02:14:11,900
Please stop!
I apologize!

1025
02:14:12,100 --> 02:14:13,600
I'm sorry!

1026
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:42,600
Hey, let's set the place on fire!

1027
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:44,700
Cut 'em down as they run out!

1028
02:18:18,900 --> 02:18:20,900
Serves you right!

1029
02:18:21,600 --> 02:18:23,300
We did it!

1030
02:18:25,700 --> 02:18:27,700
Take that, you sons of bitches!

1031
02:19:10,700 --> 02:19:12,000
Heihachi!

1032
02:19:32,900 --> 02:19:35,200
Are you crazy?

1033
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:52,200
Stupid idiot!

1034
02:19:52,400 --> 02:19:55,600
Look what you've done!
Who is she to you?

1035
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,300
She's my wife!

1036
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,700
Heihachi, hang on!

1037
02:20:44,800 --> 02:20:46,400
You said...

1038
02:20:48,400 --> 02:20:51,500
he'd be a treasure
in hard times.

1039
02:20:53,200 --> 02:20:55,600
The hard times
have only just begun.

1040
02:21:05,700 --> 02:21:06,900
Stop crying!

1041
02:21:07,700 --> 02:21:09,700
Damn fool!

1042
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:12,600
Stop crying!

1043
02:22:40,600 --> 02:22:42,600
Goddamn!
Here they come!

1044
02:23:55,800 --> 02:23:59,500
Take note:
They have three muskets.

1045
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:27,400
Twenty riders bound north,
13 south.

1046
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:29,700
- Muskets?
- Three in all.

1047
02:24:30,900 --> 02:24:33,900
Take the south, and watch out
for those muskets.

1048
02:25:30,300 --> 02:25:32,500
Retreat! Retreat!

1049
02:25:48,200 --> 02:25:51,700
- The 12 headed south have turned east.
- Wasn't that 13?

1050
02:25:51,900 --> 02:25:53,900
An arrow got one of them.

1051
02:25:54,100 --> 02:25:55,600
Good old Gorobei.

1052
02:25:58,400 --> 02:26:01,700
Make sure the eastern bridge is out,
and watch out for --

1053
02:26:01,900 --> 02:26:03,400
The muskets!

1054
02:26:12,500 --> 02:26:16,000
Take the north.
That's where we'll battle it out.

1055
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:20,400
If you knew that, why didn't
you build a fence there too?

1056
02:26:20,600 --> 02:26:23,000
Every great castle
needs a breach.

1057
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:27,500
Draw the enemy there and attack.
You can't win by defense alone.

1058
02:26:39,200 --> 02:26:41,400
Use your balls,
if you've got any!

1059
02:26:45,500 --> 02:26:48,000
Take it away, damn it!

1060
02:26:51,400 --> 02:26:54,200
Twelve riders are on the way.
Hurry with the bridge!

1061
02:26:54,400 --> 02:26:57,100
Are you blind?
What do you think we're doing?

1062
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,400
And he said
to watch out for the muskets.

1063
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:03,600
What kinda idiot
you take me for?

1064
02:27:10,300 --> 02:27:11,600
Where are you going?

1065
02:27:11,800 --> 02:27:14,600
We're looking for Father.
We can't find him anywhere.

1066
02:27:14,900 --> 02:27:19,500
Father intends to die in that barn.
That's what he's always wanted.

1067
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:27,400
Stubborn old fool!

1068
02:27:27,900 --> 02:27:30,100
Hurry up and get him!

1069
02:27:33,700 --> 02:27:35,700
Get out of our way!

1070
02:27:36,700 --> 02:27:40,000
What are you doing?
Hurry up!

1071
02:28:01,800 --> 02:28:04,100
- On this mountain --
- Twenty riders.

1072
02:28:04,500 --> 02:28:07,100
And 12 to the east.

1073
02:28:07,300 --> 02:28:08,700
Right.

1074
02:28:24,500 --> 02:28:27,600
This won't do.
They're all scared stiff.

1075
02:28:31,500 --> 02:28:33,000
Good! Again!

1076
02:28:34,700 --> 02:28:36,200
Again!

1077
02:28:39,600 --> 02:28:42,700
Shichiroji's at it.
Let's fire ours up too.

1078
02:28:44,300 --> 02:28:45,900
Everybody out here!

1079
02:28:51,200 --> 02:28:53,700
Raise your spears
and give the battle cry.

1080
02:28:58,400 --> 02:28:59,200
Again!

1081
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:06,500
Damn 'em, listen to that!
We can beat 'em!

1082
02:29:10,500 --> 02:29:13,100
Yohei, what's that look for?
Again!

1083
02:29:18,300 --> 02:29:20,200
Take cover!

1084
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:26,800
Here they come!

1085
02:29:43,400 --> 02:29:44,900
Goddamn 'em!

1086
02:30:21,100 --> 02:30:24,200
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

1087
02:30:28,600 --> 02:30:30,800
Oh, no, you don't!

1088
02:30:35,600 --> 02:30:37,200
Don't panic!

1089
02:30:46,100 --> 02:30:48,500
Goddamn you!

1090
02:30:52,600 --> 02:30:54,000
They're burning!

1091
02:30:54,500 --> 02:30:56,300
Damn bastards!

1092
02:31:26,200 --> 02:31:29,200
Back to your posts, everyone!

1093
02:31:30,400 --> 02:31:32,100
Dear!

1094
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,800
They're just rickety shacks!

1095
02:31:39,700 --> 02:31:42,700
Everybody, back to your posts!

1096
02:31:54,200 --> 02:31:55,700
Goddamn it!

1097
02:31:57,400 --> 02:31:59,100
You dogs!

1098
02:31:59,400 --> 02:32:02,000
That's the Old Man's house!

1099
02:32:04,600 --> 02:32:07,200
Where's the Old Man?
What about that couple?

1100
02:32:07,700 --> 02:32:10,700
And the little brat?
What the hell's going on?

1101
02:32:13,800 --> 02:32:16,800
Stop!
You can't abandon your post!

1102
02:32:18,700 --> 02:32:20,800
Kikuchiyo, come back!

1103
02:32:22,900 --> 02:32:24,300
Kikuchiyo!

1104
02:32:39,500 --> 02:32:42,300
Where's the Old Man
and your husband?

1105
02:32:52,300 --> 02:32:55,200
She's been speared.
How'd she make it this far?

1106
02:33:01,800 --> 02:33:03,600
Let's go!

1107
02:33:10,200 --> 02:33:12,300
Damn it, what is it now?

1108
02:33:15,600 --> 02:33:18,200
This baby... is me.

1109
02:33:18,700 --> 02:33:21,200
This is just
what happened to me!

1110
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:31,800
Here we go!

1111
02:34:40,600 --> 02:34:42,600
What the hell?

1112
02:34:56,900 --> 02:34:59,400
What the hell
were you staring at?

1113
02:35:00,600 --> 02:35:02,200
Idiot!

1114
02:36:04,500 --> 02:36:06,500
No one wounded?

1115
02:36:06,900 --> 02:36:09,300
Good.
You did a fine job.

1116
02:36:09,600 --> 02:36:11,200
Fine job!

1117
02:36:14,600 --> 02:36:16,800
Gunpowder!
Take cover!

1118
02:36:27,300 --> 02:36:29,000
Manzo!

1119
02:36:42,800 --> 02:36:44,700
Where were you hit?

1120
02:36:45,300 --> 02:36:48,400
Shino! Shino!
Bring me my daughter.

1121
02:36:49,500 --> 02:36:50,900
Don't bother.

1122
02:36:51,300 --> 02:36:54,200
If this kills you,
you'd die of a fleabite.

1123
02:36:55,500 --> 02:36:58,000
You make a ruckus
over a little scratch

1124
02:36:58,200 --> 02:37:02,000
and blow your daughter's cover
in the process. Nice going!

1125
02:37:31,500 --> 02:37:33,700
You don't have
to chase them all down.

1126
02:37:37,100 --> 02:37:39,200
That's far enough.
Well done.

1127
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:41,800
Who are you?

1128
02:37:43,800 --> 02:37:45,400
Rikichi.

1129
02:38:00,500 --> 02:38:02,900
They've attacked from the east,
west and south

1130
02:38:03,100 --> 02:38:06,100
and run away each time
with their tails between their legs.

1131
02:38:06,300 --> 02:38:08,000
This is the only approach left.

1132
02:38:08,200 --> 02:38:10,800
We don't know
if they'll come tonight,

1133
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,100
but when they do,
they'll mass their forces here.

1134
02:38:13,300 --> 02:38:15,000
Perhaps, but...

1135
02:38:15,700 --> 02:38:17,700
I don't hear a thing.

1136
02:38:30,800 --> 02:38:32,600
Nevertheless,

1137
02:38:33,300 --> 02:38:35,600
this will surely
be the focus of their attack.

1138
02:38:36,100 --> 02:38:38,000
I'll prove it to you in a minute.

1139
02:39:22,100 --> 02:39:23,400
Good work.

1140
02:39:23,600 --> 02:39:26,600
Now poke that scarecrow out
from behind those trees.

1141
02:40:01,200 --> 02:40:04,200
I'd say tomorrow morning

1142
02:40:04,600 --> 02:40:07,100
they'll attack us here
with everything they've got.

1143
02:40:07,200 --> 02:40:10,100
And we'll let them in.

1144
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:17,100
Don't worry.
I mean we'll let one in.

1145
02:40:18,200 --> 02:40:20,200
Two at most.

1146
02:40:21,200 --> 02:40:24,900
Once they're in,
we form a wall again with our spears.

1147
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:28,400
The one or two who get in
are as good as dead.

1148
02:40:28,700 --> 02:40:30,700
We can cook 'em up
any way we want.

1149
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:37,500
We'll pick them off patiently,
one by one, until the final showdown.

1150
02:40:37,700 --> 02:40:39,700
Those muskets worry me.

1151
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,100
If only we could
get one of them.

1152
02:40:44,700 --> 02:40:48,000
I'll go.
I swear I'll get one!

1153
02:40:48,200 --> 02:40:51,100
No. You're looking to die.
I'll go.

1154
02:41:44,300 --> 02:41:46,200
Footsteps! Listen!

1155
02:41:46,400 --> 02:41:49,600
That's enough.
Get some rest.

1156
02:41:49,800 --> 02:41:52,800
It's true! I hear them!
Listen.

1157
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,100
I said enough.

1158
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:59,100
You're exhausted.
Get some rest.

1159
02:42:01,900 --> 02:42:03,500
I hear them.

1160
02:42:31,700 --> 02:42:33,400
Two more down.

1161
02:43:08,500 --> 02:43:09,600
What is it?

1162
02:43:12,800 --> 02:43:16,800
State your business.
I'm going to get some sleep.

1163
02:43:18,400 --> 02:43:21,800
You are a magnificent person.

1164
02:43:26,100 --> 02:43:30,200
I've wanted to tell you so
for some time.

1165
02:43:56,200 --> 02:43:57,900
They're here.

1166
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
We'll let one in.

1167
02:44:06,800 --> 02:44:08,700
We're letting one in!

1168
02:44:16,200 --> 02:44:20,700
Remember, after the first one's in,
jump out with your spears.

1169
02:44:39,600 --> 02:44:40,800
Here they come.

1170
02:45:16,800 --> 02:45:18,500
Step aside!

1171
02:45:21,100 --> 02:45:22,600
Good work.

1172
02:45:30,400 --> 02:45:33,400
What's wrong?
You did well.

1173
02:45:33,900 --> 02:45:35,800
Here he comes!
Scatter!

1174
02:45:53,400 --> 02:45:55,600
Fall back! Fall back!

1175
02:46:01,300 --> 02:46:03,300
After them!

1176
02:46:11,600 --> 02:46:13,300
Another on the way!

1177
02:47:55,500 --> 02:47:57,200
Here he comes.

1178
02:48:13,500 --> 02:48:15,300
Watch this!

1179
02:48:21,300 --> 02:48:23,900
Having fun
with your horsey?

1180
02:48:45,700 --> 02:48:50,200
They've stopped.
Won't fall for that trick again, eh?

1181
02:48:59,200 --> 02:49:02,300
They're all wimps!
Who's scared of bandits anyway?

1182
02:49:09,300 --> 02:49:14,500
That little skirmish just cost them four.
Kyuzo got two last night.

1183
02:49:31,200 --> 02:49:33,400
That man is a true samurai.

1184
02:49:33,700 --> 02:49:36,400
He's fearless,
his swordsmanship is amazing,

1185
02:49:36,600 --> 02:49:38,300
and yet he's kind too.

1186
02:49:38,500 --> 02:49:42,100
He never once boasted
about capturing that musket.

1187
02:49:42,600 --> 02:49:47,100
He walked into a forest filled with bandits
as if on a mushroom hunt.

1188
02:49:48,500 --> 02:49:52,700
Fascinating.
I'm not bored at all, I swear.

1189
02:50:10,500 --> 02:50:12,400
Hey, Yohei.

1190
02:50:13,300 --> 02:50:14,800
Take over for me.

1191
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,900
What's that face for?

1192
02:50:21,200 --> 02:50:23,300
There's no danger here now.

1193
02:50:24,900 --> 02:50:27,100
You make a great scarecrow.

1194
02:51:58,600 --> 02:51:59,800
Hear me good!

1195
02:52:00,900 --> 02:52:03,300
If anybody else turns yellow --

1196
02:52:09,500 --> 02:52:10,800
Out of my way!

1197
02:53:34,300 --> 02:53:35,500
Hey!

1198
02:53:39,300 --> 02:53:40,400
How's it goin'?

1199
02:53:40,600 --> 02:53:42,600
Man, they're a pain.

1200
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
Won't be long now.

1201
02:53:45,500 --> 02:53:48,700
Everything's upside down.

1202
02:53:48,900 --> 02:53:52,700
They burn us out,
and we starve like farmers.

1203
02:53:53,600 --> 02:53:56,400
Quit your moaning.
There are better times ahead.

1204
02:53:56,600 --> 02:53:58,900
Do your part, man.

1205
02:54:38,600 --> 02:54:40,800
Hey, it's me!

1206
02:54:48,100 --> 02:54:49,800
Serves you right, you dogs!

1207
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:51,000
Fool!

1208
02:54:52,200 --> 02:54:54,200
Why did you leave your post?

1209
02:54:54,400 --> 02:54:55,700
Just look at this!

1210
02:54:55,900 --> 02:54:59,500
Don't scold me, man.
My post is fine.

1211
02:55:00,400 --> 02:55:03,900
There's nothing heroic
about selfishly grabbing for glory.

1212
02:55:04,100 --> 02:55:08,300
Listen to me:
War is not fought alone!

1213
02:55:18,700 --> 02:55:21,600
Gorobei and Kyuzo,
guard this post!

1214
02:55:28,200 --> 02:55:30,200
Let no one pass!

1215
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:40,800
Stop, you asses!

1216
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:42,600
Damn you!

1217
02:57:43,300 --> 02:57:45,300
Damn it! Two made it in!

1218
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:04,000
Goddamn it!

1219
02:58:04,700 --> 02:58:06,300
Where's Yohei?

1220
02:58:46,300 --> 02:58:47,600
Yohei!

1221
02:58:49,300 --> 02:58:50,600
Yohei!

1222
02:58:51,200 --> 02:58:54,300
I defended my post.

1223
02:58:54,500 --> 02:58:57,100
Don't give up, Yohei!

1224
02:59:00,500 --> 02:59:02,300
Go ahead, shoot me!

1225
02:59:40,400 --> 02:59:42,100
Shichiroji, take over!

1226
02:59:53,400 --> 02:59:55,200
Gorobei!

1227
03:00:04,800 --> 03:00:06,800
Gorobei!

1228
03:00:58,800 --> 03:01:01,000
Just 13 left.

1229
03:01:01,700 --> 03:01:03,700
But these last seven...

1230
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:07,000
came at a steep price.

1231
03:01:28,200 --> 03:01:30,900
How are you? Tired?

1232
03:01:32,900 --> 03:01:36,700
Poor man.
You've lost a lot of weight.

1233
03:01:40,900 --> 03:01:43,500
I'll go throw
some water on my face.

1234
03:01:54,100 --> 03:01:56,700
<i>Next time they come,
we fight to the finish.</i>

1235
03:01:56,900 --> 03:02:01,200
It's better we fight it out
before we're spent.

1236
03:02:01,400 --> 03:02:05,000
When do you think
they'll attack?

1237
03:02:06,400 --> 03:02:09,400
They're exhausted too,
and a few are wounded.

1238
03:02:09,900 --> 03:02:11,900
They won't come tonight.

1239
03:02:12,100 --> 03:02:17,300
But they have no food,
and their ranks are splitting.

1240
03:02:18,300 --> 03:02:20,300
They can't afford
to dawdle either.

1241
03:02:20,600 --> 03:02:26,700
I say they'll come at us like hell
tomorrow morning.

1242
03:02:28,100 --> 03:02:29,700
Katsushiro.

1243
03:02:49,300 --> 03:02:50,800
An order from above.

1244
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:54,100
Place two on watch
and let the rest sleep.

1245
03:02:54,800 --> 03:02:58,800
The men may visit their families
one at a time.

1246
03:03:00,700 --> 03:03:02,100
So tomorrow's the showdown?

1247
03:03:04,200 --> 03:03:06,400
Yes.
Please carry out the order.

1248
03:03:13,100 --> 03:03:16,900
You all heard what he just said.

1249
03:03:20,900 --> 03:03:23,300
I'll stand guard.

1250
03:03:23,900 --> 03:03:25,700
The rest of you sleep.

1251
03:03:26,700 --> 03:03:29,900
Manzo...

1252
03:03:30,700 --> 03:03:32,800
you go home first.

1253
03:03:33,200 --> 03:03:35,500
Take a good look
at your daughter --

1254
03:03:36,400 --> 03:03:38,600
I mean, your son.

1255
03:03:47,700 --> 03:03:48,900
I told them.

1256
03:03:49,100 --> 03:03:51,300
All right. Get some rest.

1257
03:03:55,400 --> 03:03:57,700
Katsushiro.

1258
03:03:58,600 --> 03:04:00,200
How was Kikuchiyo?

1259
03:04:00,400 --> 03:04:03,400
Still beside the grave.

1260
03:04:03,700 --> 03:04:04,900
I see.

1261
03:05:18,300 --> 03:05:21,100
Are we all going
to die tomorrow?

1262
03:05:21,300 --> 03:05:24,400
There's no way to know.

1263
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:27,500
But we might!

1264
03:05:49,800 --> 03:05:51,200
Shino.

1265
03:05:51,800 --> 03:05:53,500
Where's Shino?

1266
03:05:59,200 --> 03:06:00,700
Anyone seen Shino?

1267
03:06:35,200 --> 03:06:37,800
Sake, eh?
Where'd you find it?

1268
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:56,000
I see. They have stockpiles,
just like Kikuchiyo said,

1269
03:06:56,200 --> 03:06:58,200
and tonight it all comes out.

1270
03:07:07,600 --> 03:07:10,200
I think I'll help myself.

1271
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:15,500
Shino!

1272
03:07:41,300 --> 03:07:44,400
Here's some sake.
Drink up and get some sleep.

1273
03:07:49,700 --> 03:07:53,900
This is hardly like you.
You must rest for the battle tomorrow.

1274
03:08:05,500 --> 03:08:07,600
Shino!

1275
03:09:12,700 --> 03:09:14,600
<i>You tramp!</i>

1276
03:09:24,100 --> 03:09:27,100
You wench!

1277
03:09:31,100 --> 03:09:33,200
Stop this brutality!

1278
03:09:33,400 --> 03:09:37,600
What the hell's a farmer girl
doing with a samurai?

1279
03:10:03,100 --> 03:10:04,700
You slut!

1280
03:10:14,900 --> 03:10:16,400
Manzo.

1281
03:10:17,300 --> 03:10:19,800
Is this your daughter?

1282
03:10:26,300 --> 03:10:28,100
Tell me what happened.

1283
03:10:28,300 --> 03:10:32,600
You mentioned a samurai.
Who was it?

1284
03:10:34,300 --> 03:10:35,700
Manzo!

1285
03:10:45,500 --> 03:10:47,300
Manzo, say something.

1286
03:10:48,400 --> 03:10:49,900
Speak!

1287
03:11:22,400 --> 03:11:24,500
Are you Shino?

1288
03:11:43,800 --> 03:11:47,000
Manzo, don't be angry.

1289
03:11:48,500 --> 03:11:51,500
When the dawn threatens
our very lives,

1290
03:11:51,700 --> 03:11:55,000
the weight of it
makes us all a little reckless.

1291
03:12:00,900 --> 03:12:03,400
On the eve of decisive battles...

1292
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:07,700
this often happens,
even inside castles.

1293
03:12:10,600 --> 03:12:14,600
Remember what it was to be young.
You can't blame them.

1294
03:12:15,600 --> 03:12:17,700
I can't forgive them.

1295
03:12:17,900 --> 03:12:21,000
I can't stand by when my only daughter
has been made damaged goods.

1296
03:12:35,700 --> 03:12:40,300
What's wrong with two people in love?
It's not like bandits took her!

1297
03:14:12,600 --> 03:14:16,800
They're wound up tight.
We need to loosen them up.

1298
03:14:24,900 --> 03:14:28,200
Everyone, the final battle
is here at last.

1299
03:14:31,200 --> 03:14:35,400
By the way, Katsushiro,
we expect much of you today.

1300
03:14:37,200 --> 03:14:40,200
As of last night,
you became a real man.

1301
03:14:58,300 --> 03:14:59,800
Hey!

1302
03:15:02,800 --> 03:15:05,900
Where's that fighting spirit?

1303
03:15:07,700 --> 03:15:11,300
You'll never win
with such long faces!

1304
03:15:24,900 --> 03:15:27,000
Kikuchiyo, what are you up to?

1305
03:15:27,200 --> 03:15:29,500
I can't kill five
with just one blade.

1306
03:15:45,200 --> 03:15:47,100
There are 13 left.

1307
03:15:48,300 --> 03:15:52,200
We'll let them all in.

1308
03:15:53,900 --> 03:15:56,200
Once they pass this point,

1309
03:15:56,800 --> 03:16:00,600
we close in from all sides
at the crossing.

1310
03:16:03,500 --> 03:16:07,700
Everything's riding
on this battle!

1311
03:16:38,000 --> 03:16:40,200
Here they come!

1312
03:17:03,500 --> 03:17:05,600
Here they come!

1313
03:17:30,100 --> 03:17:32,300
Shichiroji and Katsushiro,
go west!

1314
03:17:32,600 --> 03:17:34,900
Kyuzo, Kikuchiyo, east!

1315
03:19:16,400 --> 03:19:19,300
Katsushiro! Rikichi!

1316
03:19:19,500 --> 03:19:22,100
East! Go east!

1317
03:19:22,300 --> 03:19:24,200
East!

1318
03:19:41,300 --> 03:19:43,000
Shut up!

1319
03:19:43,500 --> 03:19:45,700
Scream and you're dead!

1320
03:20:33,000 --> 03:20:34,200
We did it!

1321
03:20:34,400 --> 03:20:35,700
We did it!

1322
03:20:35,900 --> 03:20:38,600
Head east!

1323
03:20:54,000 --> 03:20:56,300
Katsushiro, pull back!

1324
03:20:58,900 --> 03:21:01,100
Damn you!

1325
03:21:02,800 --> 03:21:04,300
Kikuchiyo!

1326
03:21:40,500 --> 03:21:42,600
Kikuchiyo!

1327
03:21:53,000 --> 03:21:56,000
Where are the bandits?

1328
03:21:56,200 --> 03:21:58,200
They're all dead!

1329
03:22:16,500 --> 03:22:19,300
Once more we survive.

1330
03:25:57,500 --> 03:26:01,100
In the end,
we lost this battle too.

1331
03:26:02,000 --> 03:26:03,300
What?

1332
03:26:04,100 --> 03:26:05,700
I mean,

1333
03:26:06,100 --> 03:26:08,700
the victory belongs
to those peasants.

1334
03:26:10,000 --> 03:26:11,800
Not to us.

1335
03:26:12,000 --> 03:26:45,900
