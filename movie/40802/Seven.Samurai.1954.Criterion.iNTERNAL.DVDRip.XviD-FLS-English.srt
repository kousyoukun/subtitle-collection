17
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,726
During the Civil Wars,

18
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:19,558
an endless cycle of conflict
left the countryside overrun by bandits.

19
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:23,862
Peaceable folk lived in terror
of the thunder of approaching hooves...

20
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,977
Take this village too?

21
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,880
Take it! Take it!

22
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,186
Not so fast!

23
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:20,348
We just took their rice last fall.

24
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,461
They'll have nothing now.

25
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,429
Very well.

26
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,429
We'll return
when that barley's ripe!

27
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,729
Is there no god to protect us?

28
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:10,136
Land tax, forced labor,
war, drought...

29
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,506
and now bandits!

30
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:21,614
The gods want us farmers dead!

31
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,517
That's right!
We're better off dead!

32
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:30,426
What's all this?
Crying won't change anything.

33
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,764
The magistrate can do more
than collect taxes.

34
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,797
We can ask him for help.

35
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,760
We know all about him!

36
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:42,270
He shows up after they're gone,
acting big while he surveys the damage.

37
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,602
That's right. He's useless.

38
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:50,077
We might as well hand over
our rice and barley to the bandits

39
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,547
and just hang ourselves!

40
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:56,487
That'll bring the magistrate
here in a hurry!

41
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,761
We'll kill those bandits.

42
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,799
We'll kill them all.

43
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:14,029
Never again!
Let's kill 'em all!

44
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,297
Not me!

45
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,142
I couldn't possibly -

46
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,249
That's crazy talk.

47
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,484
So we can kill defeated samurai
but not bandits?

48
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:33,456
Stop it! This is no time
to fight amongst ourselves.

49
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:40,623
We don't have a chance against bandits.
And when we lose?

50
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:44,166
They'll slaughter us all,
down to the last unborn child.

51
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,806
I've had enough!
Better to risk it all

52
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,669
than to live like this.
Kill or be killed!

53
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,309
Rikichi!

54
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,509
The farmer's only choice
is to endure.

55
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,807
We can't defy the powerful.

56
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,386
When the bandits arrive,
we'll greet them meekly

57
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,383
and quietly hand over
all our barley.

58
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:10,420
We'll plead with them to leave
just enough for us to survive.

59
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:16,028
"That's all we ask, "
we'll beg on our hands and knees.

60
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,935
What bandit will agree to that?

61
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:25,470
Have you forgotten how low we had
to stoop for the rice we're eating now?

62
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,992
We should go see the Old Man.

63
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,568
Let him decide what to do.

64
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,364
Consider who
we 're dealing with here.

65
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,976
Give a wolf a taste of your leg
and he'll ask for your hand.

66
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,975
Once they have a taste,
they'll be back in the fall.

67
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,445
- But what if we lose?
- Then we're no worse off!

68
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,986
Without our barley,
we're doomed anyway!

69
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,387
We fig ht.

70
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,323
Old Man, that's mad ness.

71
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,965
We're farmers.
What do we know of battle?

72
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,692
We'll hire samurai.

73
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:35,200
Whoever heard of farmers
hiring samurai?

74
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,539
I saw it with my own eyes,

75
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:45,779
when the village you were born in
was torched.

76
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:50,984
I saw it when we escaped
to this village here.

77
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:59,096
The only village that didn't burn
was the one that hired samurai.

78
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:03,094
But Old Man, there are
different kinds of villages and villagers.

79
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,793
How are we to feed samurai
when we live on rice gruel?

80
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,199
We'll make do on millet!

81
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:11,706
Show me a samurai who'll fight
for farmers in return for food!

82
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,902
They're a proud lot.

83
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,137
Look.

84
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:20,080
Find hungry samurai.

85
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:27,087
Even bears come down from
the mountains when they're hungry.

86
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:13,332
How dare you?

87
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:18,240
You're nothing but a farmer!
I'm still a samurai!

88
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,241
I don't need your charity!

89
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,949
Fool!

90
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:33,887
What'd I tell you?

91
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,927
Look, the barley's ripe.

92
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,088
Ten days already
since we left the village.

93
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,664
What do we do?

94
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:20,237
This barley's early,
not like our mountain barley.

95
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:26,637
Hey, we're soaked through
to the bone.

96
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:30,509
Find any cheap, strong
and foolhardy samurai?

97
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,522
Leftovers.

98
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,157
You can have 'em cheap.

99
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,621
That's a laugh!

100
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:18,222
- What's so funny?
- He's blind.

101
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,132
- What about you, then?
- Not me.

102
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,666
I'd rather eat horseshit.

103
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:33,206
- Won't get a nose bleed outta him.
- Cleaned him out gambling last night.

104
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:37,246
Pulled his sword when he lost,
so the three of us beat him up.

105
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,849
Not a drop left in his nose now.

106
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:47,183
Don't bother.
They only eat millet.

107
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:50,456
Is that true?
You can't live like that.

108
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,564
Without nourishment
you'll go night-blind.

109
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,663
I've got just four left.

110
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:58,496
I'll trade 'em all
for a cup of rice.

111
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,669
What do you say?

112
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:06,035
Damn! What a bunch.

113
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,325
What a waste.

114
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:32,495
If we still had that rice,
we coulda bought 40 of those.

115
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,569
Shut up!

116
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,599
But it's true, right?

117
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,712
The blockhead's cracking up!

118
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,678
What a show.
Go at it, boys.

119
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:53,217
Who ever heard
of anything so unfair?

120
00:14:54,793 --> 00:15:00,629
We give him his fill of rice
and a free bottle of sake,

121
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,799
and he thanks us
with a beating.

122
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,330
Good for him!

123
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:11,505
Not like this one
playing possum here.

124
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:17,043
Say, let's go home.
Let's just go home.

125
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,583
Look at him sobbing.

126
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,447
Misses his wifey.

127
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,715
I'd pay good money
to watch the two of 'em going at it.

128
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:30,487
Let's hurry
and get back to the village.

129
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:34,154
Go on home. You can't afford buns,
let alone samurai.

130
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:39,236
Farmers like us know
good from bad when it comes to seed,

131
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,236
but not when it comes
to samurai.

132
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:48,245
Besides, we're no match
for the tough ones,

133
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:54,880
and the only ones interested
are weaklings.

134
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:07,730
If I lost last night,
it was only because I was starving.

135
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:12,701
Liar! You had plenty
of money to gamble.

136
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,071
Jerk!

137
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,798
Wanna fight?

138
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,972
It's a fight.

139
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,782
Over here!
Wake up!

140
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,959
Quit that strumming, monk!
It's depressing!

141
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,960
Keep it up, grandpa.
We're on your side.

142
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,600
Rikichi!

143
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,026
Stop it, Manzo!

144
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,462
You said we were going home,
you son of a bitch!

145
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:25,377
I said we'd go home,
not bargain with bandits!

146
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,705
If we can't hire samurai,
what's left?

147
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:31,542
It's bargain or nothing!

148
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,113
Fine, have it your way!

149
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,296
But tell me:

150
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:48,565
If we do strike a bargain,

151
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,997
what have we got
to offer this year?

152
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,001
Are you willing to give 'em
your daughter?

153
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,909
Shino's a fine-lookin' girl.

154
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,629
What's going on?

155
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:36,740
There's a thief in that barn.
We raised a ruckus and he ran in to hide.

156
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,263
How many thieves are there?

157
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,524
Just one.

158
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,401
One?

159
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:08,665
All of you can't take
a single thief?

160
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:13,709
We don't dare make a move.
He took a kid in there with him.

161
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,676
Says he'll kill him
if we attack.

162
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,411
Listen. Hear him?

163
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,884
Poor thing.

164
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,220
It all happened
in the middle of the night.

165
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:34,695
Poor kid's been bawling
the better part of a day.

166
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,028
He can barely
make a sound now.

167
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:45,369
He's only seven.
Imagine how his parents feel.

168
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:49,274
Who's that samurai
getting his head shaved?

169
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:53,815
No idea. We asked him for help
and he agreed right away.

170
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,010
Then he asked us
for two rice balls.

171
00:20:56,221 --> 00:21:00,419
He asked a monk to shave his head
and lend him his robes.

172
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,150
No idea what he's up to.

173
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:38,912
Stay back!
Any closer and I kill the brat!

174
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,058
I'm a monk.

175
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,386
Stay back!

176
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,791
I'm just a monk.
I mean you no harm.

177
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,573
I won't come in.

178
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:59,870
I just thought the child
must be very hungry.

179
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,478
I've brought some rice balls.

180
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,480
You should eat one yourself.

181
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:16,557
Won't you have one?

182
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:17,894
What's wrong?

183
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,795
Throw 'em here!

184
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:25,629
Here.

185
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,595
My baby!

186
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:09,801
Even you can't object
to a samurai like that.

187
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,772
Ask him quickly.
It'll be harder in town.

188
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,892
What do you want?

189
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:43,604
My name is Katsushiro Okamoto.
Please make me your disciple!

190
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:47,641
Disciple?

191
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:51,680
As you see, I'm a ronin.
The name is Kambei Shimada.

192
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,545
I don't take on disciples.

193
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:57,415
Get up.
I can't talk to you like this.

194
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,852
I'm begging you -
let me be your disciple.

195
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:05,894
First get off your knees.
We'll talk as we go.

196
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,938
I'm at a loss.

197
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:23,171
You think far too highly of me.

198
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:24,109
No, sir -

199
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,045
Just hear me out.

200
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,379
There's nothing special
about me.

201
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,819
I may have seen
my share of battle,

202
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:35,993
but always on the losing side.

203
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:38,958
That about sums me up.

204
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:42,190
Better not to follow
such an unlucky man.

205
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,360
No, I'm determined to follow you
whether you allow me to or not.

206
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:49,164
I forbid it.

207
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:53,243
I don't have the means
to travel with an attendant.

208
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,182
Can I help you?

209
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,129
What do you want?

210
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:26,344
Insolence!

211
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:30,306
Stay out of this, little chick.

212
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,453
Are you a samurai?

213
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,285
Damn right I am!

214
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,024
I wonder.

215
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,233
Bastard.

216
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,150
Who was that?

217
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:21,056
Leave him be.

218
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:41,248
I beg of you, sir!

219
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:46,282
You idiot.
Why don't you scram?

220
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,428
Stubborn old fool.
They'll eat it and run like last time.

221
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:59,893
It will never work.

222
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:03,563
Sir, we could arm the villagers
with bamboo spears.

223
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:06,369
- I thought of that.
- But, sir -

224
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,447
This isn't a game.

225
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,515
They may be bandits,
but they ride 40 strong.

226
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:22,386
Two or three samurai
won't suffice.

227
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:39,237
Defense is more difficult
than offense.

228
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:43,476
You say there are mountains
behind the village?

229
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:44,477
Yes.

230
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:46,377
Passable by horse?

231
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:47,573
Yes.

232
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:59,025
Fields in front.

233
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,721
Until those are flooded
with water,

234
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,126
you're open to mounted attack
on four sides.

235
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:09,301
You need at least four men,
one to guard each side.

236
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:13,440
Two more to guard the rear.

237
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:17,777
No matter how frugal
our estimate,

238
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,982
we need seven,
including me.

239
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,485
We can manage
seven somehow.

240
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,386
But the Old Man said four.

241
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:30,254
It's only three more.

242
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:32,320
Hold on a second.

243
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:36,227
I haven't accepted your offer.
I'm only speculating.

244
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:42,103
First of all, it's not easy
to find trustworthy samurai.

245
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:47,500
What's more,
all you have to offer is food.

246
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,316
Only those out to fight
for the hell of it will agree.

247
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:57,017
Besides, I'm sick of fighting.

248
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,150
Age, I suppose.

249
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:24,572
Good thing
I wasn't born a peasant.

250
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,820
Better to be born a dog.
Goddamn it.

251
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:34,090
Go ahead - hang yourself and die!
You're better off dead!

252
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:35,691
Silence, you lout!

253
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,454
What's it to you?
I'm only telling the truth.

254
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:42,929
What truth? What the hell do you know
of these farmers' suffering?

255
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:44,726
Don't make me laugh!

256
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,597
Like you would know.

257
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:47,634
How dare you?

258
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:51,240
You heard right. If you know,
why don't you help them?

259
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,373
So you wanna fight?

260
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:02,149
That's enough.

261
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,324
Enough!

262
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:20,934
Hey, samurai, look at this.

263
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:22,970
This here's your dinner.

264
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:25,802
But what do you think
these blockheads eat?

265
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,272
Millet.

266
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:31,539
They eat millet
to feed you white rice.

267
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:35,241
This is the best they can offer.
What do you say to that?

268
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:38,955
- All right, then.
- What?

269
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,590
Quit your jabbering.

270
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,658
I won't let this rice go to waste.

271
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,718
Manzo and the others are back!

272
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:23,891
Where are Rikichi and Yohei?

273
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,798
They stayed behind.
We still need more samurai.

274
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,267
The samurai are coming?

275
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,498
They sure are.
Seven of 'em.

276
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:31,902
Seven?

277
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,481
Seven.

278
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:42,246
I was against it
because you said four, Old Man.

279
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:49,120
I figured we'd need
at least ten.

280
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:54,390
But if I'd said ten,
we'd have ended up with 15.

281
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,961
That's the way it goes.

282
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:02,500
Old Man, I'm worried.

283
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,772
The village girls will go crazy
over the samurai.

284
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:15,180
If the samurai touch 'em,
all hell will break loose.

285
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:21,658
Bandits are coming, you fool.

286
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,294
Your head is on the block,

287
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:28,927
and all you think of
are your whiskers?

288
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,736
Samurai, sir.

289
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:54,217
- You require my services?
- Yes, sir.

290
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,419
Who's to be my opponent?

291
00:34:57,628 --> 00:34:59,323
Katsushiro.

292
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,172
Hide just inside the door.

293
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,110
Strike that ronin as he enters.

294
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,615
Here he comes.

295
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:32,453
Don't hold back.
Give him a real whack.

296
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,050
Excellent!

297
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:08,089
Please don't take offense.
I am Kambei Shimada.

298
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:12,736
We're seeking expert swordsmen
and have no time to waste.

299
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,234
Forgive me.

300
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,167
What's this about?

301
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:19,167
The reason better be good,
or I'll have to redeem my honor.

302
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:23,837
I humbly beg your pardon.
We only sought to test your skill.

303
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:27,347
We must soon contend
with a gang of bandits.

304
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:31,187
I see.
And whose clan do you serve?

305
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:36,759
It pains me to tell you,
but we're fighting for farmers.

306
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,485
- Farmers?
- That's right.

307
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:42,097
This job affords
no stipend and no reward.

308
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:46,360
But we can eat our fill
as long as we fight.

309
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,036
This is absurd!

310
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,167
My ambitions
are greater than that.

311
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:57,110
That's a shame.
Won't you reconsider?

312
00:36:58,015 --> 00:36:59,380
I will not.

313
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:10,751
Sir, we lost a good man there.
Such a fine swordsman.

314
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:58,499
What's wrong?

315
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:03,112
That one samurai's good,
but how'll the other six be?

316
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:05,407
Enough of your worrying.

317
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:10,178
How can we know before they get here?
Don't worry till you've seen 'em.

318
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,437
That one there.

319
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:48,123
Excuse me, samurai, sir.

320
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,159
Just like last time?

321
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,559
Sure.
It's good practice for you.

322
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:32,659
Surely you jest.

323
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,263
No offense intended.

324
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,045
I'm with you.

325
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,719
But I have to say

326
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:59,991
that although I understand
the farmers' suffering

327
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:04,858
and understand
why you would take up their cause,

328
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:09,938
it's your character
that I find most compelling.

329
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:15,471
In life one finds friends
in the strangest places.

330
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:24,079
- What is your name?
- Gorobei Katayama.

331
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:26,256
A name fit for a giant, no?

332
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,726
Yohei, what are you doing?
Hurry and wash the rice.

333
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:46,700
Yohei!

334
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:51,776
What's wrong?

335
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:56,543
Someone stole the rice.

336
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:10,859
You idiot!
Didn't I warn you?

337
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:13,832
I was so careful.

338
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:23,036
I slept the whole night
hugging that rice jar.

339
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:30,153
Fine, then!
I'll get more from home!

340
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,956
But what'll we do

341
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,352
till you get back?

342
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:39,825
There's only a handful left.

343
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:34,178
Stop that, you idiot!

344
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,115
Hide that money.
The master's returning.

345
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:45,357
I ran into you
at just the right time.

346
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:54,262
So you're still alive.
I figured you'd long since left this earth.

347
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:03,608
Now tell me,
what happened after that?

348
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:07,342
I hid among the grasses
in the moat until dark.

349
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:15,656
When the outer walls tumbled down
on me in flames, I knew I was finished.

350
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:19,128
What ran through your mind
at that moment?

351
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,999
Nothing special.

352
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:28,132
Sick of fighting yet?

353
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:43,216
Truth is, there's a tough battle ahead
leading to neither money nor rank.

354
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,786
Will you join us?
- Yes.

355
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,819
This may be the one
that kills us.

356
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,711
Where are they
when you need 'em?

357
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:14,008
What do you need, sir?

358
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:16,413
Samurai.

359
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:22,620
There's a pretty poor excuse for one
in my backyard.

360
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:26,421
I couldn't believe his gumption.

361
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,360
He says,
" I'm hungry. Feed me.

362
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:33,627
I'm broke, though,
so I'll pay you by chopping wood."

363
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:42,376
I like his frankness.

364
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:25,021
Never seen a man
split wood before?

365
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,690
Sure, but you do it
with such relish.

366
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:31,793
It's just my nature.
Sorry if it bothers you.

367
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,897
You're very good.

368
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:41,435
It's nothing compared
to how I cut down men.

369
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:45,130
- Have you cut down many?
- That I have.

370
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:48,038
There's no cutting me off
when I start cutting.

371
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:54,715
So I make it a point
to run away first.

372
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:58,280
A most excellent approach.

373
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:00,650
Why, thank you kindly.

374
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:12,734
T ell me, do you feel like
cutting down 30 bandits?

375
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:33,314
Let us commence!

376
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:05,542
Too bad.

377
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:07,011
It's a draw.

378
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,707
I'm afraid not.

379
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:10,181
I won.

380
00:48:13,857 --> 00:48:14,915
That's ridiculous!

381
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:19,421
If these were steel,
you'd be dead now.

382
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:26,695
- Then we fight with steel!
- Don't throw your life away.

383
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:27,598
What?

384
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:31,103
Don't you see?
With steel blades, you'd die.

385
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:32,741
It's a waste of your life.

386
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:35,343
Wait! Don't try to flee.

387
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:41,951
Draw! This isn't
a contest of words!

388
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:22,085
This is preposterous.

389
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:25,386
There's no contest.

390
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:58,923
How did you fare?

391
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:05,927
We let a good fish get away.
An excellent swordsman.

392
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:09,465
They say the fish that gets away
looks bigger than it really is.

393
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:10,867
No.

394
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:15,469
I watched him cut a man down
with my own eyes.

395
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:24,147
It was amazing.

396
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:28,550
A man obsessed only
with testing the limits of his skill.

397
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:31,184
I doubt he'll join us.

398
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:33,761
- That's a shame.
- Indeed.

399
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:37,928
I did tell him
where we're staying, though.

400
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:40,202
And how did you fare?

401
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:42,568
- Caught one.
- I see.

402
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:46,209
- As a swordsman, barely mediocre.
- Barely mediocre?

403
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,612
But an honest, amusing man.

404
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:53,577
Something about him
brightens one's spirits.

405
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:56,477
He'll be a treasure in hard times.

406
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,218
Much obliged.

407
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:05,192
Actually, I did land one myself.
- The one dressed as a peddler?

408
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:06,487
That's right.

409
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:09,324
In fact, he's an old trusted friend.

410
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:17,137
I'll bring some water.

411
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:22,936
I'm Heihachi Hayashida.

412
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:26,115
A modest warrior
of the Wood-Chop School.

413
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:34,957
Just three more to go.

414
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:37,524
Three? Don't you mean two?

415
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:40,127
No, we can't afford
to take a child along.

416
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:42,597
Master!

417
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:44,762
I know, I know.

418
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:47,568
I know what you'll say.

419
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:51,935
I was once your age, you know.

420
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,044
Hone your skills,

421
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:58,543
then go to war
and do great things.

422
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:02,783
Then become lord
of your own castle and domain.

423
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:09,022
But as you dream those dreams,
before you know it,

424
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:11,387
your hair will turn
as gray as mine.

425
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:17,089
By that time

426
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,736
you've lost your parents
and you're all alone.

427
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,945
Tomorrow you go home.

428
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:13,845
You've learned a lot
these four or five days.

429
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:15,991
You have
fine stories to tell.

430
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:35,572
Please, sir.
I beg you to let him come along.

431
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:38,748
Why not let him come?
You call him a kid, but -

432
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:40,280
Actually,

433
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:42,713
kids work harder than adults.

434
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:47,316
But only if you treat them
like adults.

435
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:51,359
Then let's treat him
like an adult.

436
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,535
That means only two more.

437
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,899
Actually just one, it seems.

438
00:54:09,379 --> 00:54:11,506
You wish to join us?

439
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:14,650
I'm very grateful.

440
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:16,876
- When do we depart?
- Tomorrow.

441
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:21,714
Tomorrow?

442
00:54:23,526 --> 00:54:27,428
This is enough. We don't have time
to find the last one.

443
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:31,861
All right, then.

444
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,796
Master!

445
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:39,436
Master!
- All right.

446
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:43,707
- Master!
- All right! That's enough of that!

447
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:51,351
Hey, I just found
a real tough samurai.

448
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:53,920
There was a huge fight.
They were no match for him.

449
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,684
Never seen anything like it.
He's like a wild dog.

450
00:54:56,893 --> 00:54:59,885
Someone stopped the fight.
They started drinking.

451
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:01,723
I told him about you.

452
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:03,660
He's on his way.

453
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:08,037
Shall we give him the usual?

454
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:23,781
What are you doing?

455
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,881
Testing him.

456
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:28,915
That's a dirty trick!

457
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,559
Hey, samurai!
- Just shut up and watch.

458
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:33,786
A true samurai won't get hit.

459
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,658
But this guy's drunk!

460
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:38,698
A samurai never drinks
enough to dull his wits.

461
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,148
I told you!
You guys are nuts.

462
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,049
What the -

463
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:05,757
Who the hell hit me?

464
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:23,105
You?

465
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:31,449
Who hit me?

466
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:38,760
You?

467
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:43,492
Damn bastard!

468
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:13,895
You again!

469
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:19,935
I see that bald head of yours
in my dreams!

470
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:24,439
Hey, you.

471
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:28,208
How dare you even ask me
if I'm a samurai!

472
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,769
You got some nerve!

473
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:34,479
Don't mess with me.

474
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:44,793
I may look like hell,
but I'm a real samurai!

475
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:52,734
I've been looking for you
ever since that day.

476
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,029
Wanted you to see this.

477
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:06,072
Look at this!

478
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:11,276
This is my family tree.
All my ancestors are here.

479
00:58:13,189 --> 00:58:17,455
Damn you, trying to make
a fool outta me. Screw you.

480
00:58:19,362 --> 00:58:20,659
Looky here.

481
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:24,061
Making a fool outta me.

482
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:33,004
My honorable self
is right here.

483
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:36,411
So this Kikuchiyo here
would be you?

484
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:38,410
That is correct.

485
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:42,979
"Kikuchiyo,
born February 17, 1574"

486
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,148
What's so damned funny?

487
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:51,387
You hardly look
13 years old to me.

488
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:56,264
If you are in fact
the Kikuchiyo listed here,

489
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:59,333
you'd now be precisely
13 years old.

490
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:06,570
Where'd you steal
this family tree?

491
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:10,543
Steal it? Shit!

492
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:13,148
Damn jerks.

493
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:15,374
To hell with samurai.

494
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:19,013
To hell with samurai!

495
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:24,257
Hey, you bastard!

496
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:28,390
Come back here!

497
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:31,829
Goddamn it,
you son of a bitch!

498
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:45,310
What's wrong, teenager?
Here you are.

499
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,711
Damn you!

500
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:53,288
Come back here!

501
01:00:28,324 --> 01:00:30,292
What's wrong, Lord Kikuchiyo?

502
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:37,189
What's the matter, junior?

503
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:49,369
Screw samurai!

504
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:09,625
- Is he really a samurai?
- In his own mind, anyway.

505
01:01:20,743 --> 01:01:22,677
Take me too!

506
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:30,008
Hey, Kikuchiyo.

507
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,554
Guard your treasure.

508
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:39,395
Let me go too!

509
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:22,129
What is it, Father?

510
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:40,518
What is it?

511
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:43,551
What are you staring at?

512
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:55,295
Shino, cut off your hair.

513
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:58,099
Cut your hair
and dress like a man.

514
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:02,767
- What are you talking about?
- Just cut it off!

515
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,716
It's only because I love you.
No telling what those samurai'll do!

516
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:08,815
No!

517
01:03:09,018 --> 01:03:11,418
No, I won't!

518
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:17,248
Shino!

519
01:03:42,118 --> 01:03:43,449
He's a fool.

520
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:47,089
But Manzo knows those samurai
better than anyone.

521
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:49,383
If he cut off his daughter's hair,
he must have good reason.

522
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:52,720
You've only got sons,
so you're safe, but we -

523
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:55,454
Goddamn it!
Now I understand.

524
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:59,533
So you agree to hide my daughter
at your place across the bridge?

525
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:02,670
Idiot! I meant that I see
what Manzo's up to.

526
01:04:03,406 --> 01:04:09,072
That rascal doesn't care about the village,
only about his daughter.

527
01:04:09,445 --> 01:04:10,844
Damn him!

528
01:04:29,932 --> 01:04:32,127
Look what you've done!

529
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:34,661
Now the whole village is crazed.

530
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:37,101
Every family
with a girl's gone mad.

531
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:40,967
How do you plan
to set this right?

532
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:43,940
The samurai will show up
any day now.

533
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:47,806
Come on.
We're seeing the Old Man.

534
01:04:49,852 --> 01:04:52,878
There's nothing to see here!
Go home!

535
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:55,555
Go home!

536
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:00,887
We can't let the samurai
see us like this.

537
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:09,638
He's still following us.

538
01:06:54,977 --> 01:06:57,002
Where did Kikuchiyo go?

539
01:06:57,947 --> 01:06:59,676
Think he gave up?

540
01:06:59,915 --> 01:07:01,678
It's funny.

541
01:07:01,984 --> 01:07:04,077
Now that he's gone,
it's almost a little...

542
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:06,250
lonely.

543
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:13,786
This way.

544
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:18,063
Oh, hell!

545
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:33,572
So that's our castle, eh?

546
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:37,413
No way I'm gonna die
in that dungheap.

547
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:40,145
No one asked you to.

548
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:02,443
We're back!
The samurai have arrived!

549
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:09,474
The samurai are here!

550
01:08:14,156 --> 01:08:17,819
What's wrong with you?
The samurai are here!

551
01:08:23,966 --> 01:08:25,991
Hey, what's wrong?

552
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:31,836
What's the matter?

553
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:48,187
This is a fine welcome.

554
01:08:51,827 --> 01:08:53,886
What's the meaning of this?

555
01:08:56,799 --> 01:09:00,735
Hey, what's going on?
The samurai have arrived!

556
01:09:16,852 --> 01:09:19,184
- We'll go see the Old Man.
- The Old Man?

557
01:09:19,388 --> 01:09:22,357
Whatever happens in the village,
the Old Man -

558
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:24,583
He's the village elder?

559
01:09:26,128 --> 01:09:30,588
An audience with the village elder.
This is truly an honor.

560
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:36,063
Well, let's go.

561
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:53,480
I know they're being foolish.

562
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:57,751
All farmers ever do is worry,

563
01:10:57,953 --> 01:11:02,788
whether the rain falls,
the sun shines, or the wind blows.

564
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:05,184
In short,

565
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:09,355
all they know is fear.

566
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:13,395
Their behavior today...

567
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:18,531
is also due simply to fear.

568
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:26,305
But Old Man,
why do the villagers fear us?

569
01:11:27,249 --> 01:11:31,015
What can they expect from us
under such circumstances?

570
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:03,479
Samurai, sirs!

571
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:06,713
Samurai, please!

572
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:26,836
Quiet down!

573
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:30,134
Don't panic. Calm down.

574
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:33,543
I want clear answers.

575
01:12:33,749 --> 01:12:36,047
Where are the bandits
coming from?

576
01:12:36,251 --> 01:12:39,516
- The mountains!
- No, the road!

577
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:45,954
Who saw the bandits?
Come forward.

578
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:48,423
No one saw any bandits?

579
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:51,157
Then who sounded the alarm?

580
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:52,595
I did!

581
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:01,439
Outta the way.

582
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:08,572
What's with the faces?

583
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:12,945
Don't worry.
No bandits have come.

584
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:19,989
Hey, blockheads.

585
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:23,858
Remember how you welcomed us
when we got here?

586
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:26,861
But as soon as I bang on this,

587
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:30,436
"Samurai, sirs!
Samurai, please!"

588
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:33,136
You're practically groveling!

589
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:40,641
Got what you deserved,
you mud snails.

590
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,959
Got a problem, gramps?

591
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:02,467
Nope.

592
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:04,998
All's well now.

593
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:13,308
Looks like he's good
for something after all.

594
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:16,109
There are seven of us at last.

595
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:25,293
Sorry it's so dirty.

596
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:29,328
But where will you sleep
if we take your home?

597
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:33,032
- In the barn.
- With your horse?

598
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:37,505
The bandits
got my horse last year.

599
01:14:54,857 --> 01:14:58,452
A barn's not so bad
with a wife to snuggle up to.

600
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:04,928
I don't have a wife!

601
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:06,828
What's the matter, you fool?

602
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:19,914
Jerk.

603
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:36,157
By the way,
what's your real name?

604
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:39,897
I don't remember.

605
01:15:40,302 --> 01:15:42,668
Give me a new one that fits.

606
01:15:43,138 --> 01:15:45,333
Then Kikuchiyo it is.

607
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,669
Fits you perfectly.

608
01:16:08,997 --> 01:16:11,659
How would you attack
this village?

609
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:14,427
I'd charge from this mountain.

610
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:18,164
I agree.
Along this road.

611
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:20,901
WEST

612
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:38,756
And what's the best defense?

613
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:41,153
Shichiroji knows what to do.

614
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:45,264
See these logs?
He'll make a fence to block the horses.

615
01:16:45,467 --> 01:16:47,935
Indeed.
Your trusty right-hand man.

616
01:17:16,932 --> 01:17:18,229
All right!

617
01:17:18,867 --> 01:17:20,425
Listen.

618
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,538
Nothing forces you to run
like a battle.

619
01:17:24,072 --> 01:17:26,939
You run when you attack,
you run when you retreat.

620
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:29,474
When you can't run anymore,
you die.

621
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:50,487
SOUTH

622
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:07,508
We'll flood these fields
after they harvest the barley.

623
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:12,379
That'll make a good defense.
But will we have time?

624
01:18:12,587 --> 01:18:13,884
Indeed.

625
01:18:21,496 --> 01:18:22,929
Charge!

626
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:28,062
Pretend I'm a bandit
and stab me.

627
01:18:31,073 --> 01:18:32,700
Charge!

628
01:18:35,911 --> 01:18:37,572
Come on!

629
01:18:46,588 --> 01:18:48,021
Next.

630
01:18:49,758 --> 01:18:51,248
Next.

631
01:18:51,593 --> 01:18:53,652
What's wrong with all of you?

632
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:20,881
EAST

633
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:28,988
Destroying this bridge
will foil an assault from the east.

634
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:39,165
But what about the houses
on the other side?

635
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:49,109
They'll have to evacuate those.

636
01:19:53,488 --> 01:19:55,581
And the mill?

637
01:19:57,526 --> 01:20:00,689
The Old Man's
not going to go quietly.
