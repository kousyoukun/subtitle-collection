Directed by
AKIRA KUROSAWA

18
00:03:13,785 --> 00:03:15,744
During the Civil Wars,

19
00:03:15,912 --> 00:03:20,583
an endless cycle of conflict
left the countryside overrun by bandits.

20
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,879
Peaceable folk lived in terror
of the thunder of approaching hooves...

21
00:04:08,798 --> 00:04:12,009
Take this village too?

22
00:04:12,177 --> 00:04:14,887
Take it! Take it!

23
00:04:15,764 --> 00:04:17,223
Not so fast!

24
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:21,393
We just took their rice last fall.

25
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:23,479
They'll have nothing now.

26
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:25,439
Very well.

27
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:28,442
We'll return
when that barley's ripe!

28
00:05:00,976 --> 00:05:03,769
Is there no god to protect us?

29
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:11,151
Land tax, forced labor,
war, drought...

30
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,530
and now bandits!

31
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:22,621
The gods want us farmers dead!

32
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,541
That's right!
We're better off dead!

33
00:05:27,085 --> 00:05:31,463
What's all this?
Crying won't change anything.

34
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:34,800
The magistrate can do more
than collect taxes.

35
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,802
We can ask him for help.

36
00:05:37,762 --> 00:05:39,805
We know all about him!

37
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:43,309
He shows up after they're gone,
acting big while he surveys the damage.

38
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,644
That's right. He's useless.

39
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:51,108
We might as well hand over
our rice and barley to the bandits

40
00:05:51,276 --> 00:05:53,569
and just hang ourselves!

41
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,489
That'll bring the magistrate
here in a hurry!

42
00:06:08,084 --> 00:06:09,793
We'll kill those bandits.

43
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,838
We'll kill them all.

44
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:15,049
Never again!
Let's kill 'em all!

45
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,343
Not me!

46
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,180
I couldn't possibly -

47
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:25,267
That's crazy talk.

48
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:30,522
So we can kill defeated samurai
but not bandits?

49
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:34,485
Stop it! This is no time
to fight amongst ourselves.

50
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:41,658
We don't have a chance against bandits.
And when we lose?

51
00:06:41,826 --> 00:06:45,204
They'll slaughter us all,
down to the last unborn child.

52
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:48,832
I've had enough!
Better to risk it all

53
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,710
than to live like this.
Kill or be killed!

54
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,337
Rikichi!

55
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,548
The farmer's only choice
is to endure.

56
00:06:56,758 --> 00:06:58,842
We can't defy the powerful.

57
00:07:00,512 --> 00:07:03,389
When the bandits arrive,
we'll greet them meekly

58
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:06,392
and quietly hand over
all our barley.

59
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:11,438
We'll plead with them to leave
just enough for us to survive.

60
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:17,069
"That's all we ask,"
we'll beg on our hands and knees.

61
00:07:18,613 --> 00:07:20,948
What bandit will agree to that?

62
00:07:21,324 --> 00:07:26,495
Have you forgotten how low we had
to stoop for the rice we're eating now?

63
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,018
We should go see the Old Man.

64
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:52,604
Let him decide what to do.

65
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:00,380
<i>Consider who</i>
<i>we're dealing with here.</i>

66
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:06,011
<i>Give a wolf a taste of your leg</i>
<i>and he'll ask for your hand.</i>

67
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:09,014
<i>Once they have a taste,</i>
<i>they'll be back in the fall.</i>

68
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:12,476
<i>- But what if we lose?</i>
<i>- Then we're no worse off!</i>

69
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,021
<i>Without our barley,</i>
<i>we're doomed anyway!</i>

70
00:09:21,152 --> 00:09:22,402
We fight.

71
00:09:24,155 --> 00:09:26,365
Old Man, that's madness.

72
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,992
We're farmers.
What do we know of battle?

73
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,703
We'll hire samurai.

74
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:36,208
Whoever heard of farmers
hiring samurai?

75
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:40,546
I saw it with my own eyes,

76
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:46,802
when the village you were born in
was torched.

77
00:09:47,762 --> 00:09:52,015
I saw it when we escaped
to this village here.

78
00:09:53,226 --> 00:10:00,107
The only village that didn't burn
was the one that hired samurai.

79
00:10:00,441 --> 00:10:04,111
But Old Man, there are
different kinds of villages and villagers.

80
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,822
How are we to feed samurai
when we live on rice gruel?

81
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,240
We'll make do on millet!

82
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:12,744
Show me a samurai who'll fight
for farmers in return for food!

83
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,913
They're a proud lot.

84
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,164
Look.

85
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:21,086
Find hungry samurai.

86
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:28,093
Even bears come down from
the mountains when they're hungry.

87
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:14,348
How dare you?

88
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:19,269
You're nothing but a farmer!
I'm still a samurai!

89
00:11:19,437 --> 00:11:21,271
I don't need your charity!

90
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:25,984
Fool!

91
00:11:33,117 --> 00:11:34,910
What'd I tell you?

92
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:09,945
Look, the barley's ripe.

93
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,115
Ten days already
since we left the village.

94
00:12:13,282 --> 00:12:15,701
What do we do?

95
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:21,248
This barley's early,
not like our mountain barley.

96
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,671
Hey, we're soaked through
to the bone.

97
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,550
Find any cheap, strong
and foolhardy samurai?

98
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,549
Leftovers.

99
00:13:12,717 --> 00:13:14,176
You can have 'em cheap.

100
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:15,635
That's a laugh!

101
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:19,264
- What's so funny?
- He's blind.

102
00:13:20,725 --> 00:13:23,143
- What about you, then?
- Not me.

103
00:13:23,311 --> 00:13:25,687
I'd rather eat horseshit.

104
00:13:29,984 --> 00:13:34,237
- Won't get a nose bleed outta him.
- Cleaned him out gambling last night.

105
00:13:34,405 --> 00:13:38,283
Pulled his sword when he lost,
so the three of us beat him up.

106
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,869
Not a drop left in his nose now.

107
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:48,210
Don't bother.
They only eat millet.

108
00:13:48,711 --> 00:13:51,463
Is that true?
You can't live like that.

109
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:54,591
Without nourishment
you'll go night-blind.

110
00:13:54,842 --> 00:13:56,676
I've got just four left.

111
00:13:56,844 --> 00:13:59,513
I'll trade 'em all
for a cup of rice.

112
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:01,681
What do you say?

113
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:07,062
Damn! What a bunch.

114
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:28,333
What a waste.

115
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,505
If we still had that rice,
we coulda bought 40 of those.

116
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:34,589
Shut up!

117
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,634
But it's true, right?

118
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,721
The blockhead's cracking up!

119
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,683
What a show.
Go at it, boys.

120
00:14:49,564 --> 00:14:54,234
Who ever heard
of anything so unfair?

121
00:14:55,778 --> 00:15:01,658
We give him his fill of rice
and a free bottle of sake,

122
00:15:02,493 --> 00:15:05,829
and he thanks us
with a beating.

123
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,374
Good for him!

124
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:12,544
Not like this one
playing possum here.

125
00:15:12,837 --> 00:15:18,049
Say, let's go home.
Let's just go home.

126
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,595
Look at him sobbing.

127
00:15:21,762 --> 00:15:23,471
Misses his wifey.

128
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,725
I'd pay good money
to watch the two of 'em going at it.

129
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:31,521
Let's hurry
and get back to the village.

130
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:35,191
Go on home. You can't afford buns,
let alone samurai.

131
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,238
Farmers like us know
good from bad when it comes to seed,

132
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:43,241
but not when it comes
to samurai.

133
00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:49,247
Besides, we're no match
for the tough ones,

134
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:55,921
and the only ones interested
are weaklings.

135
00:16:03,846 --> 00:16:08,767
If I lost last night,
it was only because I was starving.

136
00:16:09,894 --> 00:16:13,730
Liar! You had plenty
of money to gamble.

137
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:16,107
Jerk!

138
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,817
Wanna fight?

139
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,987
It's a fight.

140
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:26,785
Over here!
Wake up!

141
00:16:37,171 --> 00:16:39,965
Quit that strumming, monk!
It's depressing!

142
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,969
Keep it up, grandpa.
We're on your side.

143
00:17:15,126 --> 00:17:16,626
Rikichi!

144
00:17:17,461 --> 00:17:19,045
Stop it, Manzo!

145
00:17:19,463 --> 00:17:22,507
You said we were going home,
you son of a bitch!

146
00:17:23,384 --> 00:17:26,386
I said we'd go home,
not bargain with bandits!

147
00:17:27,138 --> 00:17:29,723
If we can't hire samurai,
what's left?

148
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,559
It's bargain or nothing!

149
00:17:33,436 --> 00:17:36,146
Fine, have it your way!

150
00:17:44,822 --> 00:17:46,322
But tell me:

151
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:49,576
If we do strike a bargain,

152
00:17:49,744 --> 00:17:52,037
what have we got
to offer this year?

153
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:55,040
Are you willing to give 'em
your daughter?

154
00:17:56,917 --> 00:17:58,918
Shino's a fine-lookin' girl.

155
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,637
What's going on?

156
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:37,767
There's a thief in that barn.
We raised a ruckus and he ran in to hide.

157
00:19:59,915 --> 00:20:02,292
How many thieves are there?

158
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:03,543
Just one.

159
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:05,420
One?

160
00:20:07,047 --> 00:20:09,674
All of you can't take
a single thief?

161
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:14,721
We don't dare make a move.
He took a kid in there with him.

162
00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:17,682
Says he'll kill him
if we attack.

163
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:21,436
Listen. Hear him?

164
00:20:26,775 --> 00:20:28,902
Poor thing.

165
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:31,237
It all happened
in the middle of the night.

166
00:20:31,405 --> 00:20:35,700
Poor kid's been bawling
the better part of a day.

167
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:39,037
He can barely
make a sound now.

168
00:20:42,249 --> 00:20:46,377
He's only seven.
Imagine how his parents feel.

169
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:50,298
Who's that samurai
getting his head shaved?

170
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:54,844
No idea. We asked him for help
and he agreed right away.

171
00:20:55,012 --> 00:20:57,055
Then he asked us
for two rice balls.

172
00:20:57,223 --> 00:21:01,434
He asked a monk to shave his head
and lend him his robes.

173
00:21:01,602 --> 00:21:03,186
No idea what he's up to.

174
00:22:35,946 --> 00:22:39,949
<i>Stay back!</i>
<i>Any closer and I kill the brat!</i>

175
00:22:40,117 --> 00:22:42,076
I'm a monk.

176
00:22:42,244 --> 00:22:44,412
<i>Stay back!</i>

177
00:22:46,206 --> 00:22:49,834
I'm just a monk.
I mean you no harm.

178
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,591
I won't come in.

179
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:00,887
I just thought the child
must be very hungry.

180
00:23:06,268 --> 00:23:08,519
I've brought some rice balls.

181
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:11,522
You should eat one yourself.

182
00:23:14,234 --> 00:23:17,570
Won't you have one?

183
00:23:17,946 --> 00:23:18,905
What's wrong?

184
00:23:23,077 --> 00:23:24,827
<i>Throw 'em here!</i>

185
00:23:25,496 --> 00:23:26,662
Here.

186
00:23:54,358 --> 00:23:56,609
My baby!

187
00:25:08,098 --> 00:25:10,808
Even you can't object
to a samurai like that.

188
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:13,811
Ask him quickly.
It'll be harder in town.

189
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:31,913
What do you want?

190
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:44,634
My name is Katsushiro Okamoto.
Please make me your disciple!

191
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:48,679
Disciple?

192
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:52,683
As you see, I'm a ronin.
The name is Kambei Shimada.

193
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:55,561
I don't take on disciples.

194
00:25:55,729 --> 00:25:58,439
Get up.
I can't talk to you like this.

195
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:01,859
I'm begging you -
let me be your disciple.

196
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:06,906
First get off your knees.
We'll talk as we go.

197
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:20,962
I'm at a loss.

198
00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:24,215
You think far too highly of me.

199
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:25,132
No, sir -

200
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,051
Just hear me out.

201
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:30,388
There's nothing special
about me.

202
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:33,849
I may have seen
my share of battle,

203
00:26:34,017 --> 00:26:37,019
but always on the losing side.

204
00:26:37,187 --> 00:26:39,981
That about sums me up.

205
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:43,234
Better not to follow
such an unlucky man.

206
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:48,406
No, I'm determined to follow you
whether you allow me to or not.

207
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:50,199
I forbid it.

208
00:26:51,285 --> 00:26:54,245
I don't have the means
to travel with an attendant.

209
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:08,217
Can I help you?

210
00:27:16,393 --> 00:27:18,144
What do you want?

211
00:27:26,361 --> 00:27:27,361
Insolence!

212
00:27:29,197 --> 00:27:31,324
Stay out of this, little chick.

213
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:36,454
Are you a samurai?

214
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:42,293
Damn right I am!

215
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:47,048
I wonder.

216
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,265
Bastard.

217
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:14,158
Who was that?

218
00:28:20,457 --> 00:28:22,083
Leave him be.

219
00:28:40,394 --> 00:28:42,269
I beg of you, sir!

220
00:28:44,147 --> 00:28:47,316
You idiot.
Why don't you scram?

221
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:53,447
Stubborn old fool.
They'll eat it and run like last time.

222
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,913
It will never work.

223
00:29:01,081 --> 00:29:04,583
Sir, we could arm the villagers
with bamboo spears.

224
00:29:04,751 --> 00:29:07,378
- I thought of that.
- But, sir -

225
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:13,467
This isn't a game.

226
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:19,557
They may be bandits,
but they ride 40 strong.

227
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:23,394
Two or three samurai
won't suffice.

228
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:40,244
Defense is more difficult
than offense.

229
00:29:42,205 --> 00:29:44,498
You say there are mountains
behind the village?

230
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:45,499
Yes.

231
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:47,418
Passable by horse?

232
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:48,586
Yes.

233
00:29:57,763 --> 00:30:00,055
Fields in front.

234
00:30:00,223 --> 00:30:02,767
Until those are flooded
with water,

235
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:06,145
you're open to mounted attack
on four sides.

236
00:30:07,564 --> 00:30:10,316
You need at least four men,
one to guard each side.

237
00:30:12,152 --> 00:30:14,445
Two more to guard the rear.

238
00:30:15,989 --> 00:30:18,783
No matter how frugal
our estimate,

239
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:21,994
we need seven,
including me.

240
00:30:24,206 --> 00:30:26,499
We can manage
seven somehow.

241
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:29,418
But the Old Man said four.

242
00:30:29,586 --> 00:30:31,295
It's only three more.

243
00:30:31,755 --> 00:30:33,339
Hold on a second.

244
00:30:33,507 --> 00:30:37,259
I haven't accepted your offer.
I'm only speculating.

245
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:43,140
First of all, it's not easy
to find trustworthy samurai.

246
00:30:43,517 --> 00:30:48,521
What's more,
all you have to offer is food.

247
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:53,317
Only those out to fight
for the hell of it will agree.

248
00:30:53,693 --> 00:30:58,030
Besides, I'm sick of fighting.

249
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:01,158
Age, I suppose.

250
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:25,599
Good thing
I wasn't born a peasant.

251
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:30,855
Better to be born a dog.
Goddamn it.

252
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:35,109
Go ahead - hang yourself and die!
You're better off dead!

253
00:31:35,277 --> 00:31:36,694
Silence, you lout!

254
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:39,488
What's it to you?
I'm only telling the truth.

255
00:31:39,656 --> 00:31:43,951
What truth? What the hell do you know
of these farmers' suffering?

256
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:45,744
Don't make me laugh!

257
00:31:45,912 --> 00:31:47,621
Like you would know.

258
00:31:47,789 --> 00:31:48,664
How dare you?

259
00:31:48,832 --> 00:31:52,251
You heard right. If you know,
why don't you help them?

260
00:31:57,757 --> 00:31:59,383
So you wanna fight?

261
00:32:01,803 --> 00:32:03,178
That's enough.

262
00:32:09,477 --> 00:32:11,353
Enough!

263
00:32:18,653 --> 00:32:21,947
Hey, samurai, look at this.

264
00:32:22,115 --> 00:32:23,991
This here's your dinner.

265
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,827
But what do you think
these blockheads eat?

266
00:32:26,995 --> 00:32:28,287
Millet.

267
00:32:28,496 --> 00:32:32,583
They eat millet
to feed you white rice.

268
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:36,253
This is the best they can offer.
What do you say to that?

269
00:32:38,006 --> 00:32:39,965
- All right, then.
- What?

270
00:32:40,133 --> 00:32:41,592
Quit your jabbering.

271
00:32:46,514 --> 00:32:49,683
I won't let this rice go to waste.

272
00:33:06,743 --> 00:33:08,744
Manzo and the others are back!

273
00:33:23,343 --> 00:33:24,927
Where are Rikichi and Yohei?

274
00:33:25,095 --> 00:33:27,805
They stayed behind.
We still need more samurai.

275
00:33:27,973 --> 00:33:29,306
The samurai are coming?

276
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,517
They sure are.
Seven of 'em.

277
00:33:31,685 --> 00:33:32,935
Seven?

278
00:33:36,982 --> 00:33:38,482
Seven.

279
00:33:39,067 --> 00:33:43,278
I was against it
because you said four, Old Man.

280
00:33:44,906 --> 00:33:50,160
I figured we'd need
at least ten.

281
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:55,416
But if I'd said ten,
we'd have ended up with 15.

282
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:59,003
That's the way it goes.

283
00:34:00,296 --> 00:34:03,507
Old Man, I'm worried.

284
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:11,807
The village girls will go crazy
over the samurai.

285
00:34:11,975 --> 00:34:16,186
If the samurai touch 'em,
all hell will break loose.

286
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:22,693
Bandits are coming, you fool.

287
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:26,321
Your head is on the block,

288
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:29,950
and all you think of
are your whiskers?

289
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:40,753
Samurai, sir.

290
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:55,225
- You require my services?
- Yes, sir.

291
00:34:55,769 --> 00:34:57,436
Who's to be my opponent?

292
00:34:58,605 --> 00:35:00,355
<i>Katsushiro.</i>

293
00:35:12,368 --> 00:35:14,203
Hide just inside the door.

294
00:35:16,873 --> 00:35:19,124
Strike that ronin as he enters.

295
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:25,631
Here he comes.

296
00:35:30,386 --> 00:35:33,472
Don't hold back.
Give him a real whack.

297
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,086
Excellent!

298
00:36:05,004 --> 00:36:09,133
Please don't take offense.
I am Kambei Shimada.

299
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,762
We're seeking expert swordsmen
and have no time to waste.

300
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,264
Forgive me.

301
00:36:15,932 --> 00:36:17,182
What's this about?

302
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:20,185
The reason better be good,
or I'll have to redeem my honor.

303
00:36:20,353 --> 00:36:24,857
I humbly beg your pardon.
We only sought to test your skill.

304
00:36:25,024 --> 00:36:28,360
We must soon contend
with a gang of bandits.

305
00:36:29,237 --> 00:36:32,197
I see.
And whose clan do you serve?

306
00:36:32,365 --> 00:36:37,786
It pains me to tell you,
but we're fighting for farmers.

307
00:36:37,954 --> 00:36:39,496
- Farmers?
- That's right.

308
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:43,125
This job affords
no stipend and no reward.

309
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:47,379
But we can eat our fill
as long as we fight.

310
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,047
This is absurd!

311
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:52,176
My ambitions
are greater than that.

312
00:36:53,803 --> 00:36:58,140
That's a shame.
Won't you reconsider?

313
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:00,392
I will not.

314
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:11,778
Sir, we lost a good man there.
Such a fine swordsman.

315
00:37:57,909 --> 00:37:59,534
What's wrong?

316
00:37:59,702 --> 00:38:04,122
That one samurai's good,
but how'll the other six be?

317
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:06,416
Enough of your worrying.

318
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:11,213
How can we know before they get here?
Don't worry till you've seen 'em.

319
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:28,438
<i>That one there.</i>

320
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:49,126
Excuse me, samurai, sir.

321
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:53,171
Just like last time?

322
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:59,594
Sure.
It's good practice for you.

323
00:39:31,627 --> 00:39:33,670
Surely you jest.

324
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,298
No offense intended.

325
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:53,065
I'm with you.

326
00:39:55,568 --> 00:39:57,736
But I have to say

327
00:39:58,237 --> 00:40:01,031
that although I understand
the farmers' suffering

328
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:05,869
and understand
why you would take up their cause,

329
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:10,957
it's your character
that I find most compelling.

330
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:16,505
In life one finds friends
in the strangest places.

331
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:25,097
- What is your name?
- Gorobei Katayama.

332
00:40:25,264 --> 00:40:27,265
A name fit for a giant, no?

333
00:40:38,236 --> 00:40:41,738
Yohei, what are you doing?
Hurry and wash the rice.

334
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:47,744
Yohei!

335
00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:52,791
What's wrong?

336
00:40:54,544 --> 00:40:57,587
Someone stole the rice.

337
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:11,893
You idiot!
Didn't I warn you?

338
00:41:12,061 --> 00:41:14,855
I was so careful.

339
00:41:19,527 --> 00:41:24,072
I slept the whole night
hugging that rice jar.

340
00:41:29,162 --> 00:41:31,163
Fine, then!
I'll get more from home!

341
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:33,957
But what'll we do

342
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:36,376
till you get back?

343
00:41:36,544 --> 00:41:40,839
There's only a handful left.

344
00:42:33,434 --> 00:42:35,185
Stop that, you idiot!

345
00:42:35,353 --> 00:42:38,146
Hide that money.
The master's returning.

346
00:42:43,569 --> 00:42:46,363
I ran into you
at just the right time.

347
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:55,288
So you're still alive.
I figured you'd long since left this earth.

348
00:43:01,837 --> 00:43:04,631
Now tell me,
what happened after that?

349
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:08,385
I hid among the grasses
in the moat until dark.

350
00:43:10,805 --> 00:43:16,685
When the outer walls tumbled down
on me in flames, I knew I was finished.

351
00:43:17,687 --> 00:43:20,146
What ran through your mind
at that moment?

352
00:43:21,023 --> 00:43:24,025
Nothing special.

353
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:29,155
Sick of fighting yet?

354
00:43:37,957 --> 00:43:44,254
Truth is, there's a tough battle ahead
leading to neither money nor rank.

355
00:43:44,422 --> 00:43:46,798
Will you join us?
- Yes.

356
00:43:47,592 --> 00:43:49,843
This may be the one
that kills us.

357
00:44:10,865 --> 00:44:12,741
Where are they
when you need 'em?

358
00:44:12,908 --> 00:44:15,035
What do you need, sir?

359
00:44:15,202 --> 00:44:17,454
Samurai.

360
00:44:19,415 --> 00:44:23,627
There's a pretty poor excuse for one
in my backyard.

361
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:27,464
I couldn't believe his gumption.

362
00:44:27,632 --> 00:44:30,383
He says,
"I'm hungry. Feed me.

363
00:44:30,551 --> 00:44:34,638
I'm broke, though,
so I'll pay you by chopping wood."

364
00:44:40,019 --> 00:44:43,396
I like his frankness.

365
00:45:23,062 --> 00:45:26,022
Never seen a man
split wood before?

366
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,692
Sure, but you do it
with such relish.

367
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:32,821
It's just my nature.
Sorry if it bothers you.

368
00:45:37,576 --> 00:45:38,910
You're very good.

369
00:45:39,078 --> 00:45:42,455
It's nothing compared
to how I cut down men.

370
00:45:42,623 --> 00:45:46,167
- Have you cut down many?
- That I have.

371
00:45:46,335 --> 00:45:49,045
There's no cutting me off
when I start cutting.

372
00:45:52,341 --> 00:45:55,719
So I make it a point
to run away first.

373
00:45:56,637 --> 00:45:59,305
A most excellent approach.

374
00:45:59,473 --> 00:46:01,683
Why, thank you kindly.

375
00:46:08,858 --> 00:46:13,737
Tell me, do you feel like
cutting down 30 bandits?

376
00:46:32,715 --> 00:46:34,340
Let us commence!

377
00:48:05,307 --> 00:48:06,558
Too bad.

378
00:48:06,725 --> 00:48:08,017
It's a draw.

379
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:09,727
I'm afraid not.

380
00:48:09,895 --> 00:48:11,187
I won.

381
00:48:14,859 --> 00:48:15,942
That's ridiculous!

382
00:48:17,778 --> 00:48:20,446
If these were steel,
you'd be dead now.

383
00:48:25,536 --> 00:48:27,704
- Then we fight with steel!
- Don't throw your life away.

384
00:48:27,872 --> 00:48:28,621
What?

385
00:48:28,789 --> 00:48:32,125
Don't you see?
With steel blades, you'd die.

386
00:48:32,293 --> 00:48:33,751
It's a waste of your life.

387
00:48:33,919 --> 00:48:36,379
Wait! Don't try to flee.

388
00:48:39,967 --> 00:48:42,969
Draw! This isn't
a contest of words!

389
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:23,092
This is preposterous.

390
00:49:24,303 --> 00:49:26,429
There's no contest.

391
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:59,963
How did you fare?

392
00:50:03,801 --> 00:50:06,970
We let a good fish get away.
An excellent swordsman.

393
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:10,473
They say the fish that gets away
looks bigger than it really is.

394
00:50:10,641 --> 00:50:11,891
No.

395
00:50:12,935 --> 00:50:16,479
I watched him cut a man down
with my own eyes.

396
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:25,154
It was amazing.

397
00:50:25,447 --> 00:50:29,575
A man obsessed only
with testing the limits of his skill.

398
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,203
I doubt he'll join us.

399
00:50:32,371 --> 00:50:34,789
- That's a shame.
- Indeed.

400
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:38,960
I did tell him
where we're staying, though.

401
00:50:39,253 --> 00:50:41,212
And how did you fare?

402
00:50:41,755 --> 00:50:43,589
- Caught one.
- I see.

403
00:50:43,757 --> 00:50:47,218
- As a swordsman, barely mediocre.
- Barely mediocre?

404
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:51,639
But an honest, amusing man.

405
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:54,600
Something about him
brightens one's spirits.

406
00:50:54,893 --> 00:50:57,520
He'll be a treasure in hard times.

407
00:50:57,855 --> 00:50:59,230
Much obliged.

408
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:06,195
Actually, I did land one myself.
- The one dressed as a peddler?

409
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:07,530
That's right.

410
00:51:07,698 --> 00:51:10,366
In fact, he's an old trusted friend.

411
00:51:16,248 --> 00:51:18,166
I'll bring some water.

412
00:51:21,879 --> 00:51:23,963
I'm Heihachi Hayashida.

413
00:51:24,131 --> 00:51:27,133
A modest warrior
of the Wood-Chop School.

414
00:51:33,015 --> 00:51:35,975
Just three more to go.

415
00:51:36,143 --> 00:51:38,561
Three? Don't you mean two?

416
00:51:38,729 --> 00:51:41,147
No, we can't afford
to take a child along.

417
00:51:42,649 --> 00:51:43,608
Master!

418
00:51:43,984 --> 00:51:45,777
I know, I know.

419
00:51:46,195 --> 00:51:48,571
I know what you'll say.

420
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:52,950
I was once your age, you know.

421
00:51:54,078 --> 00:51:56,079
Hone your skills,

422
00:51:56,288 --> 00:51:59,582
then go to war
and do great things.

423
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:03,795
Then become lord
of your own castle and domain.

424
00:52:04,713 --> 00:52:10,051
But as you dream those dreams,
before you know it,

425
00:52:10,219 --> 00:52:12,428
your hair will turn
as gray as mine.

426
00:52:14,098 --> 00:52:18,101
By that time

427
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:21,771
you've lost your parents
and you're all alone.

428
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,988
Tomorrow you go home.

429
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,866
You've learned a lot
these four or five days.

430
00:53:15,033 --> 00:53:16,993
You have
fine stories to tell.

431
00:53:32,843 --> 00:53:36,596
Please, sir.
I beg you to let him come along.

432
00:53:36,763 --> 00:53:39,765
Why not let him come?
You call him a kid, but -

433
00:53:39,933 --> 00:53:41,309
Actually,

434
00:53:41,476 --> 00:53:43,728
kids work harder than adults.

435
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:48,357
But only if you treat them
like adults.

436
00:53:48,942 --> 00:53:52,361
Then let's treat him
like an adult.

437
00:53:58,035 --> 00:54:00,536
That means only two more.

438
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:03,915
Actually just one, it seems.

439
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,548
You wish to join us?

440
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:15,676
I'm very grateful.

441
00:54:15,844 --> 00:54:17,887
- When do we depart?
- Tomorrow.

442
00:54:21,683 --> 00:54:22,725
Tomorrow?

443
00:54:24,519 --> 00:54:28,439
This is enough. We don't have time
to find the last one.

444
00:54:31,151 --> 00:54:32,902
All right, then.

445
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,823
Master!

446
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:40,451
Master!
- All right.

447
00:54:41,495 --> 00:54:44,747
- Master!
- All right! That's enough of that!

448
00:54:49,503 --> 00:54:52,380
Hey, I just found
a real tough samurai.

449
00:54:52,547 --> 00:54:54,924
There was a huge fight.
They were no match for him.

450
00:54:55,092 --> 00:54:57,718
Never seen anything like it.
He's like a wild dog.

451
00:54:57,886 --> 00:55:00,930
Someone stopped the fight.
They started drinking.

452
00:55:01,098 --> 00:55:02,765
I told him about you.

453
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:04,684
He's on his way.

454
00:55:07,062 --> 00:55:09,063
Shall we give him the usual?

455
00:55:23,036 --> 00:55:24,787
What are you doing?

456
00:55:25,205 --> 00:55:26,914
Testing him.

457
00:55:28,333 --> 00:55:29,959
That's a dirty trick!

458
00:55:30,127 --> 00:55:32,586
Hey, samurai!
- Just shut up and watch.

459
00:55:32,754 --> 00:55:34,797
A true samurai won't get hit.

460
00:55:34,965 --> 00:55:36,674
But this guy's drunk!

461
00:55:36,842 --> 00:55:39,719
A samurai never drinks
enough to dull his wits.

462
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:57,153
I told you!
You guys are nuts.

463
00:55:58,322 --> 00:56:00,072
What the -

464
00:56:03,952 --> 00:56:06,787
Who the hell hit me?

465
00:56:22,471 --> 00:56:24,138
You?

466
00:56:29,186 --> 00:56:32,480
Who hit me?

467
00:56:38,278 --> 00:56:39,779
You?

468
00:56:42,282 --> 00:56:44,533
Damn bastard!

469
00:57:12,979 --> 00:57:14,897
You again!

470
00:57:17,484 --> 00:57:20,945
I see that bald head of yours
in my dreams!

471
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:25,449
Hey, you.

472
00:57:26,326 --> 00:57:29,245
How dare you even ask me
if I'm a samurai!

473
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:31,789
You got some nerve!

474
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:35,501
Don't mess with me.

475
00:57:42,342 --> 00:57:45,803
I may look like hell,
but I'm a real samurai!

476
00:57:49,307 --> 00:57:53,769
I've been looking for you
ever since that day.

477
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:57,064
Wanted you to see this.

478
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:07,116
Look at this!

479
00:58:07,284 --> 00:58:12,288
This is my family tree.
All my ancestors are here.

480
00:58:14,166 --> 00:58:18,461
Damn you, trying to make
a fool outta me. Screw you.

481
00:58:20,338 --> 00:58:21,672
Looky here.

482
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,092
Making a fool outta me.

483
00:58:31,725 --> 00:58:34,018
My honorable self
is right here.

484
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:37,438
So this Kikuchiyo here
would be you?

485
00:58:37,606 --> 00:58:39,440
That is correct.

486
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:43,986
"Kikuchiyo,
born February 17, 1574."

487
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:48,157
What's so damned funny?

488
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:52,411
You hardly look
13 years old to me.

489
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:57,291
If you are in fact
the Kikuchiyo listed here,

490
00:58:57,459 --> 00:59:00,336
you'd now be precisely
13 years old.

491
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:07,593
Where'd you steal
this family tree?

492
00:59:08,178 --> 00:59:11,555
Steal it? Shit!

493
00:59:12,182 --> 00:59:14,183
Damn jerks.

494
00:59:14,351 --> 00:59:16,393
To hell with samurai.

495
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:20,022
To hell with samurai!

496
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:25,277
Hey, you bastard!

497
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:29,406
Come back here!

498
00:59:29,574 --> 00:59:32,868
Goddamn it,
you son of a bitch!

499
00:59:43,004 --> 00:59:46,340
What's wrong, teenager?
Here you are.

500
00:59:48,552 --> 00:59:50,719
Damn you!

501
00:59:52,347 --> 00:59:54,306
Come back here!

502
01:00:29,301 --> 01:00:31,302
What's wrong, Lord Kikuchiyo?

503
01:00:36,182 --> 01:00:38,225
What's the matter, junior?

504
01:00:47,777 --> 01:00:50,404
Screw samurai!

505
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:10,633
- Is he really a samurai?
- In his own mind, anyway.

506
01:01:21,728 --> 01:01:23,687
<i>Take me too!</i>

507
01:01:28,485 --> 01:01:31,028
Hey, Kikuchiyo.

508
01:01:33,657 --> 01:01:35,574
Guard your treasure.

509
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:40,412
Let me go too!

510
01:02:20,995 --> 01:02:23,163
What is it, Father?

511
01:02:39,723 --> 01:02:41,557
What is it?

512
01:02:42,392 --> 01:02:44,560
What are you staring at?

513
01:02:52,736 --> 01:02:56,321
Shino, cut off your hair.

514
01:02:56,489 --> 01:02:59,116
Cut your hair
and dress like a man.

515
01:03:01,244 --> 01:03:03,787
- What are you talking about?
- Just cut it off!

516
01:03:04,748 --> 01:03:08,751
It's only because I love you.
No telling what those samurai'll do!

517
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:09,835
No!

518
01:03:10,003 --> 01:03:12,421
No, I won't!

519
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,260
Shino!

520
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:44,453
He's a fool.

521
01:03:44,621 --> 01:03:48,123
But Manzo knows those samurai
better than anyone.

522
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:50,417
If he cut off his daughter's hair,
he must have good reason.

523
01:03:50,585 --> 01:03:53,754
You've only got sons,
so you're safe, but we -

524
01:03:53,922 --> 01:03:56,465
Goddamn it!
Now I understand.

525
01:03:56,633 --> 01:04:00,552
So you agree to hide my daughter
at your place across the bridge?

526
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,680
Idiot! I meant that I see
what Manzo's up to.

527
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:10,103
That rascal doesn't care about the village,
only about his daughter.

528
01:04:10,438 --> 01:04:11,855
Damn him!

529
01:04:30,917 --> 01:04:33,168
Look what you've done!

530
01:04:33,586 --> 01:04:35,671
Now the whole village is crazed.

531
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,131
Every family
with a girl's gone mad.

532
01:04:39,884 --> 01:04:42,010
How do you plan
to set this right?

533
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:44,972
The samurai will show up
any day now.

534
01:04:45,807 --> 01:04:48,851
Come on.
We're seeing the Old Man.

535
01:04:50,854 --> 01:04:53,897
There's nothing to see here!
Go home!

536
01:04:55,149 --> 01:04:56,567
Go home!

537
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:01,905
We can't let the samurai
see us like this.

538
01:05:08,663 --> 01:05:10,664
He's still following us.

539
01:06:55,979 --> 01:06:58,021
Where did Kikuchiyo go?

540
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:00,691
Think he gave up?

541
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:02,693
It's funny.

542
01:07:02,986 --> 01:07:05,112
Now that he's gone,
it's almost a little...

543
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:07,280
Ionely.

544
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:14,830
This way.

545
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:19,084
Oh, hell!

546
01:07:32,015 --> 01:07:34,599
So that's our castle, eh?

547
01:07:35,685 --> 01:07:38,437
No way I'm gonna die
in that dungheap.

548
01:07:38,604 --> 01:07:41,189
No one asked you to.

549
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:03,462
We're back!
The samurai have arrived!

550
01:08:08,468 --> 01:08:10,510
The samurai are here!

551
01:08:15,141 --> 01:08:18,852
What's wrong with you?
The samurai are here!

552
01:08:24,942 --> 01:08:27,027
Hey, what's wrong?

553
01:08:31,032 --> 01:08:32,866
What's the matter?

554
01:08:46,839 --> 01:08:49,216
This is a fine welcome.

555
01:08:52,804 --> 01:08:54,930
What's the meaning of this?

556
01:08:57,767 --> 01:09:01,770
Hey, what's going on?
The samurai have arrived!

557
01:09:17,829 --> 01:09:20,205
- We'll go see the Old Man.
- The Old Man?

558
01:09:20,373 --> 01:09:23,375
Whatever happens in the village,
the Old Man -

559
01:09:23,543 --> 01:09:25,627
He's the village elder?

560
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:31,633
An audience with the village elder.
This is truly an honor.

561
01:09:35,429 --> 01:09:37,097
Well, let's go.

562
01:10:49,086 --> 01:10:54,507
I know they're being foolish.

563
01:10:55,343 --> 01:10:58,762
All farmers ever do is worry,

564
01:10:58,930 --> 01:11:03,808
whether the rain falls,
the sun shines, or the wind blows.

565
01:11:04,101 --> 01:11:06,228
In short,

566
01:11:06,812 --> 01:11:10,398
all they know is fear.

567
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:14,402
Their behavior today...

568
01:11:15,988 --> 01:11:19,574
is also due simply to fear.

569
01:11:22,245 --> 01:11:27,332
But Old Man,
why do the villagers fear us?

570
01:11:28,251 --> 01:11:32,045
What can they expect from us
under such circumstances?

571
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:04,494
Samurai, sirs!

572
01:12:05,121 --> 01:12:07,747
Samurai, please!

573
01:12:24,598 --> 01:12:27,851
Quiet down!

574
01:12:28,602 --> 01:12:31,146
Don't panic. Calm down.

575
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:34,566
I want clear answers.

576
01:12:34,734 --> 01:12:37,068
Where are the bandits
coming from?

577
01:12:37,236 --> 01:12:40,530
- The mountains!
- No, the road!

578
01:12:43,784 --> 01:12:46,995
Who saw the bandits?
Come forward.

579
01:12:47,204 --> 01:12:49,456
No one saw any bandits?

580
01:12:50,082 --> 01:12:52,167
Then who sounded the alarm?

581
01:12:52,335 --> 01:12:53,626
<i>I did!</i>

582
01:13:00,134 --> 01:13:02,469
Outta the way.

583
01:13:07,058 --> 01:13:09,601
What's with the faces?

584
01:13:10,853 --> 01:13:13,980
Don't worry.
No bandits have come.

585
01:13:19,236 --> 01:13:21,029
Hey, blockheads.

586
01:13:21,197 --> 01:13:24,866
Remember how you welcomed us
when we got here?

587
01:13:25,201 --> 01:13:27,869
But as soon as I bang on this,

588
01:13:28,037 --> 01:13:31,456
"Samurai, sirs!
Samurai, please!"

589
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:34,167
You're practically groveling!

590
01:13:39,006 --> 01:13:41,674
Got what you deserved,
you mud snails.

591
01:13:59,402 --> 01:14:01,986
Got a problem, gramps?

592
01:14:02,154 --> 01:14:03,488
Nope.

593
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:06,032
All's well now.

594
01:14:11,622 --> 01:14:14,332
Looks like he's good
for something after all.

595
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:17,127
There are seven of us at last.

596
01:14:24,301 --> 01:14:26,302
Sorry it's so dirty.

597
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:30,348
But where will you sleep
if we take your home?

598
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:34,060
- In the barn.
- With your horse?

599
01:14:35,563 --> 01:14:38,523
The bandits
got my horse last year.

600
01:14:55,833 --> 01:14:59,461
A barn's not so bad
with a wife to snuggle up to.

601
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:05,967
I don't have a wife!

602
01:15:06,135 --> 01:15:07,844
What's the matter, you fool?

603
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:20,940
Jerk.

604
01:15:34,497 --> 01:15:37,165
By the way,
what's your real name?

605
01:15:39,043 --> 01:15:40,919
I don't remember.

606
01:15:41,295 --> 01:15:43,671
Give me a new one that fits.

607
01:15:44,131 --> 01:15:46,341
Then Kikuchiyo it is.

608
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:49,677
Fits you perfectly.

609
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:12,700
How would you attack
this village?

610
01:16:12,868 --> 01:16:15,453
I'd charge from this mountain.

611
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:19,207
I agree.
Along this road.

612
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:21,918
WEST

613
01:16:36,934 --> 01:16:39,769
And what's the best defense?

614
01:16:40,062 --> 01:16:42,188
Shichiroji knows what to do.

615
01:16:42,856 --> 01:16:46,276
See these logs?
He'll make a fence to block the horses.

616
01:16:46,443 --> 01:16:48,945
Indeed.
Your trusty right-hand man.

617
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:19,267
All right!

618
01:17:19,852 --> 01:17:21,436
Listen.

619
01:17:22,563 --> 01:17:24,564
Nothing forces you to run
like a battle.

620
01:17:25,065 --> 01:17:27,942
You run when you attack,
you run when you retreat.

621
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:30,486
When you can't run anymore,
you die.

622
01:17:48,964 --> 01:17:51,507
SOUTH

623
01:18:04,813 --> 01:18:08,524
We'll flood these fields
after they harvest the barley.

624
01:18:08,776 --> 01:18:13,404
That'll make a good defense.
But will we have time?

625
01:18:13,572 --> 01:18:14,906
Indeed.

626
01:18:22,498 --> 01:18:23,956
Charge!

627
01:18:24,917 --> 01:18:29,087
Pretend I'm a bandit
and stab me.

628
01:18:32,049 --> 01:18:33,716
Charge!

629
01:18:36,887 --> 01:18:38,596
Come on!

630
01:18:47,564 --> 01:18:49,023
Next.

631
01:18:50,734 --> 01:18:52,276
Next.

632
01:18:52,569 --> 01:18:54,696
What's wrong with all of you?

633
01:19:18,721 --> 01:19:21,889
EAST

634
01:19:25,394 --> 01:19:30,022
Destroying this bridge
will foil an assault from the east.

635
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:40,199
But what about the houses
on the other side?

636
01:19:47,499 --> 01:19:50,126
They'll have to evacuate those.

637
01:19:54,465 --> 01:19:56,591
And the mill?

638
01:19:58,510 --> 01:20:01,721
The Old Man's
not going to go quietly.

639
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:10,772
Listen now.
The enemy is scary.

640
01:20:11,356 --> 01:20:12,899
Everybody's scared.

641
01:20:13,066 --> 01:20:16,569
But the other side's
scared of us too.

642
01:20:45,891 --> 01:20:47,600
Just great.

643
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:51,312
You all make great scarecrows.

644
01:20:53,649 --> 01:20:57,568
Problem is, the enemy
isn't a bunch of sparrows and crows!

645
01:21:05,994 --> 01:21:09,705
You there, chewing your cud.
Can you cut that out?

646
01:21:13,836 --> 01:21:15,878
This isn't a cow shed!

647
01:21:19,174 --> 01:21:21,592
Look at the bunch of you.

648
01:21:24,513 --> 01:21:26,180
Shit!

649
01:21:26,348 --> 01:21:29,058
First in line, step forward!

650
01:21:31,395 --> 01:21:33,479
I'm talking to you!

651
01:21:34,022 --> 01:21:35,231
You!

652
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:58,754
Look here! You gotta pay
a mon each to watch the show!

653
01:22:17,649 --> 01:22:19,400
What's this?

654
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:23,362
- A spear, sir.
- Idiot.

655
01:22:23,530 --> 01:22:26,282
Where the hell
did you get it?

656
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,702
Did it sprout up in those hills?

657
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,581
I know perfectly well.

658
01:22:33,749 --> 01:22:36,208
You hunted down retreating warriors
and took their weapons.

659
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:40,212
If you've got one,
you must have more.

660
01:22:42,799 --> 01:22:44,717
Fess up, damn it!

661
01:22:53,477 --> 01:22:55,978
NORTH

662
01:23:05,364 --> 01:23:09,617
What a peaceful grove.
But it's also a death trap.

663
01:23:45,445 --> 01:23:46,988
Katsushiro.

664
01:23:47,322 --> 01:23:49,573
We're going.
- I'll be right there.

665
01:23:57,541 --> 01:23:59,500
As I said,
he's still a child.

666
01:25:01,063 --> 01:25:03,856
Are you from the village?

667
01:25:08,403 --> 01:25:09,779
Are you a girl?

668
01:25:13,492 --> 01:25:15,743
A boy?

669
01:25:16,578 --> 01:25:19,580
Then where's your spear?

670
01:25:19,748 --> 01:25:23,167
Is this any time for an able-bodied man
to be picking flowers?

671
01:25:24,044 --> 01:25:26,337
Come here!
I'll teach you.

672
01:25:26,755 --> 01:25:28,339
Come here!

673
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:34,428
Why, you!

674
01:26:39,161 --> 01:26:42,121
This is fine, and this too.

675
01:26:42,289 --> 01:26:44,206
But this is a problem.

676
01:26:44,708 --> 01:26:47,293
<i>Heave ho! Heave ho!</i>

677
01:26:50,130 --> 01:26:52,548
Get back, the rest of you!

678
01:26:53,175 --> 01:26:55,676
Stand up straight!

679
01:27:01,016 --> 01:27:02,850
What a haul!

680
01:27:09,274 --> 01:27:10,608
What's all this?

681
01:27:10,775 --> 01:27:13,152
Plunder from defeated warriors.

682
01:27:14,779 --> 01:27:16,697
Where did you find it?

683
01:27:16,865 --> 01:27:19,867
Here in the village?
- Yep, over at Manzo's.

684
01:27:29,419 --> 01:27:31,212
What's the matter?

685
01:27:33,215 --> 01:27:35,049
Don't you like 'em?

686
01:27:37,177 --> 01:27:39,720
This is good stuff.

687
01:27:41,264 --> 01:27:42,890
What's wrong?

688
01:27:43,058 --> 01:27:46,477
You said you wanted armor,
spears and bows. Now you got 'em.

689
01:27:46,645 --> 01:27:49,104
Bastard!
You call yourself a samurai?

690
01:27:50,398 --> 01:27:53,400
Those farmers killed samurai
to get these.

691
01:27:53,568 --> 01:27:55,569
- I know that.
- Then why the hell -

692
01:27:55,737 --> 01:27:57,571
That's enough!

693
01:27:58,907 --> 01:28:02,576
You can't understand
unless you've been hunted.

694
01:28:15,382 --> 01:28:18,092
It's nothing.
Get outta here.

695
01:28:41,366 --> 01:28:46,287
Now I want to kill them all.

696
01:29:00,135 --> 01:29:02,094
Well, that's just fine and dandy!

697
01:29:04,597 --> 01:29:09,059
What did ya think
these farmers were anyway?

698
01:29:09,227 --> 01:29:11,812
Buddhas or something?

699
01:29:12,314 --> 01:29:13,939
Don't make me laugh!

700
01:29:14,107 --> 01:29:16,567
There's no creature on earth
as wily as a farmer!

701
01:29:22,407 --> 01:29:25,284
Ask 'em for rice, barley,
anything,

702
01:29:25,452 --> 01:29:27,828
and all they ever say is,
"We're all out."

703
01:29:29,205 --> 01:29:33,542
But they've got it.
They've got everything.

704
01:29:34,461 --> 01:29:38,505
Dig under the floorboards.
If it's not there, try the barn.

705
01:29:38,673 --> 01:29:44,178
You'll find plenty.
Jars of rice, salt, beans, sake!

706
01:29:49,184 --> 01:29:52,353
Go up in the mountains.
They have hidden fields.

707
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:55,564
They kowtow and lie,
playing innocent the whole time.

708
01:29:55,732 --> 01:29:58,192
You name it,
they'll cheat you on it!

709
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:01,403
After a battle, they hunt down
the losers with their spears.

710
01:30:03,782 --> 01:30:04,948
Listen to me!

711
01:30:05,116 --> 01:30:08,702
Farmers are misers, weasels,

712
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:10,120
and crybabies!

713
01:30:10,288 --> 01:30:12,706
They're mean, stupid

714
01:30:12,874 --> 01:30:14,666
murderers!

715
01:30:14,876 --> 01:30:18,003
Damn!
I could laugh till I cry!

716
01:30:21,633 --> 01:30:25,469
But tell me this:
Who turned them into such monsters?

717
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:29,139
You did!
You samurai did!

718
01:30:29,557 --> 01:30:31,392
Damn you to hell!

719
01:30:38,233 --> 01:30:40,067
In war, you burn their villages,

720
01:30:40,235 --> 01:30:43,404
trample their fields,
steal their food,

721
01:30:44,155 --> 01:30:47,241
work them like slaves,
rape their women,

722
01:30:47,409 --> 01:30:49,076
and kill 'em if they resist.

723
01:30:49,244 --> 01:30:51,120
What do you expect 'em to do?

724
01:30:51,287 --> 01:30:53,622
What the hell are farmers
supposed to do?

725
01:30:53,790 --> 01:30:56,291
Damn it! Goddamn it!

726
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:37,708
You were born a farmer,
weren't you?

727
01:32:15,246 --> 01:32:18,582
What is it now?

728
01:32:18,750 --> 01:32:22,711
Nothing at all.
Everything's fine.

729
01:33:28,403 --> 01:33:29,945
It's me.

730
01:33:30,196 --> 01:33:32,239
I'm sleeping here
from now on.

731
01:33:32,907 --> 01:33:35,242
Those guys cramp my style.

732
01:33:36,995 --> 01:33:40,080
Idiot! Stop cowering!

733
01:33:40,748 --> 01:33:42,791
This is your place!

734
01:33:43,293 --> 01:33:46,128
You hand over your house
and sleep in a barn,

735
01:33:46,296 --> 01:33:48,130
and still you can't stand up
for yourself.

736
01:33:48,298 --> 01:33:49,840
Get to sleep!

737
01:34:06,441 --> 01:34:08,400
Brings back memories.

738
01:34:26,794 --> 01:34:28,754
Sure is quiet.

739
01:34:31,633 --> 01:34:36,970
On a day like this, it's hard
to imagine bandits on that mountain.

740
01:34:38,890 --> 01:34:42,017
Damn it all,
I need a girl!

741
01:34:50,818 --> 01:34:52,319
- Where are you going?
- The hills.

742
01:34:52,487 --> 01:34:54,613
- The hills?
- To practice.

743
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:57,866
No girls up there.

744
01:34:59,535 --> 01:35:02,329
Sometimes you really
hit the nail on the head.

745
01:35:03,456 --> 01:35:05,749
What are you making there?

746
01:35:05,917 --> 01:35:07,876
- A flag.
- A flag?

747
01:35:08,586 --> 01:35:14,257
It doesn't feel right in battle
without a banner to raise high.

748
01:35:19,055 --> 01:35:20,806
What do the symbols mean?

749
01:35:20,973 --> 01:35:25,811
This represents a field:
That is, the farmers and this village.

750
01:35:26,688 --> 01:35:29,106
- And those circles?
- Those are us.

751
01:35:30,024 --> 01:35:32,693
There's only six.
You leaving me out?

752
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:35,987
No, this triangle's Lord Kikuchiyo.

753
01:35:36,155 --> 01:35:38,031
That's a good one!

754
01:36:59,197 --> 01:37:00,947
It's real rice.

755
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:03,158
Go ahead. Eat.
- But -

756
01:37:03,326 --> 01:37:05,535
Rikichi gave me some millet.

757
01:37:05,703 --> 01:37:10,040
I could barely get it down.

758
01:37:12,043 --> 01:37:13,835
Go ahead. Eat.

759
01:37:25,139 --> 01:37:26,598
Hurry up and eat.

760
01:37:26,766 --> 01:37:28,642
If you're embarrassed, I'll go.

761
01:37:28,810 --> 01:37:30,685
I'm not going to eat it.

762
01:37:30,895 --> 01:37:33,146
Why not?
I went to a lot of trouble.

763
01:37:33,314 --> 01:37:35,232
No, I just -

764
01:37:36,484 --> 01:37:41,780
I know you did, so I'll take it
to Kyuemon's grandma.

765
01:37:41,989 --> 01:37:44,741
Kyuemon's grandma?

766
01:38:05,388 --> 01:38:09,683
Rikichi, I'm full.
I'll save the rest for later.

767
01:38:10,393 --> 01:38:12,811
Go ahead and eat.

768
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:15,021
Take my leftovers this time.

769
01:38:16,023 --> 01:38:19,609
What's this?
What are you up to?

770
01:38:19,777 --> 01:38:21,361
What's going on?

771
01:38:29,370 --> 01:38:31,204
How terrible.

772
01:38:32,623 --> 01:38:36,751
Doesn't she have family?
- The bandits got them all.

773
01:38:43,217 --> 01:38:44,718
I...

774
01:38:45,553 --> 01:38:50,348
want to die quickly.

775
01:38:50,516 --> 01:38:54,769
I want to die soon

776
01:38:54,937 --> 01:38:59,232
and leave this suffering behind.

777
01:39:00,776 --> 01:39:03,194
But you know...

778
01:39:04,238 --> 01:39:08,158
the other world may be

779
01:39:08,326 --> 01:39:12,495
just as full of suffering
as this one.

780
01:39:14,290 --> 01:39:16,082
It's not.

781
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:20,629
In that world
there's no war and no bandits.

782
01:39:20,963 --> 01:39:23,173
There's no suffering there,
grandma.

783
01:39:23,341 --> 01:39:26,968
How the hell would you know?
Have you been there?

784
01:39:27,136 --> 01:39:28,929
Why the hell
are you always screaming?

785
01:39:29,096 --> 01:39:30,805
I hate wimps.

786
01:39:30,973 --> 01:39:33,642
Worms like her make me sick!

787
01:39:36,187 --> 01:39:38,313
Pissing and grumbling
about everything.

788
01:39:39,774 --> 01:39:42,776
Shit!
I want to do something wild!

789
01:39:42,985 --> 01:39:46,905
Save your spit and fire
for the bandits.

790
01:40:02,630 --> 01:40:04,464
Excuse me.

791
01:40:06,384 --> 01:40:09,552
Excuse me, but why did you -

792
01:40:09,804 --> 01:40:12,555
You saw us today, didn't you?

793
01:40:12,723 --> 01:40:15,225
Me and the -

794
01:40:15,393 --> 01:40:17,394
- The girl?
- Yes.

795
01:40:18,354 --> 01:40:22,148
Why didn't you -
- Tell them? You want me to?

796
01:40:37,331 --> 01:40:41,793
We want rice!
White rice!

797
01:40:46,507 --> 01:40:50,176
You little brats!
There's no rice!

798
01:40:55,850 --> 01:40:57,892
Quit yapping!

799
01:40:58,060 --> 01:41:03,064
If you've got the strength
to scream, "We want rice!"

800
01:41:03,232 --> 01:41:05,650
Then you don't need it!

801
01:41:06,027 --> 01:41:08,903
Listen here,
you little piss pants.

802
01:41:10,948 --> 01:41:13,199
This is all the rice there is.

803
01:41:13,367 --> 01:41:16,578
If we give you any more,
we'll get all -

804
01:41:20,249 --> 01:41:21,750
That's how it is.

805
01:41:21,917 --> 01:41:25,712
Say, any of you got
a pretty sister?

806
01:41:28,132 --> 01:41:31,885
How about you?
You got one?

807
01:41:32,094 --> 01:41:35,722
So, Old Man,
when is the harvest?

808
01:41:38,059 --> 01:41:39,893
In ten days.

809
01:41:40,061 --> 01:41:42,353
How quickly can you do it?

810
01:41:44,356 --> 01:41:47,233
No less than three days.

811
01:41:48,235 --> 01:41:50,361
We'll flood the fields
when you're done.

812
01:41:50,529 --> 01:41:54,365
You see, we want to create
a moat to the south of the village.

813
01:41:54,533 --> 01:41:56,701
It'll keep the horses out.

814
01:41:56,869 --> 01:42:00,246
We don't need all the fields.
One patch per family will do.

815
01:42:00,414 --> 01:42:01,915
Then...

816
01:42:02,416 --> 01:42:06,753
it'll take at least a day to flatten
the paths and draw the water.

817
01:42:06,921 --> 01:42:09,297
Understood.

818
01:42:09,590 --> 01:42:11,925
There's one other thing.

819
01:42:12,384 --> 01:42:18,681
You need to leave the houses this side
of the bridge, and the mill too.

820
01:42:19,767 --> 01:42:21,559
Father!

821
01:42:21,811 --> 01:42:23,978
You want us to move out?

822
01:42:31,278 --> 01:42:33,613
I know it's tough.

823
01:42:35,241 --> 01:42:37,367
But there's no choice.

824
01:42:38,953 --> 01:42:42,914
We can't possibly protect
the outlying houses.

825
01:43:04,103 --> 01:43:07,397
Listen carefully. You'll soon
begin harvesting the barley.

826
01:43:07,648 --> 01:43:09,607
The bandits will come
when you're done.

827
01:43:09,775 --> 01:43:11,651
We have to assume that.

828
01:43:11,819 --> 01:43:15,613
Therefore we prepare
for battle as we harvest.

829
01:43:15,990 --> 01:43:19,534
We'll harvest not as families
but as squads.

830
01:43:19,994 --> 01:43:24,330
Starting tomorrow,
each squad will live and work as one.

831
01:43:24,498 --> 01:43:29,419
Understood? Starting tomorrow,
nobody acts on his own.

832
01:43:30,671 --> 01:43:32,589
Hey, everybody.

833
01:43:34,175 --> 01:43:38,178
Give your wives
plenty of lovin' tonight, you hear?

834
01:43:59,325 --> 01:44:01,868
This is all a load of crap!

835
01:44:02,036 --> 01:44:04,871
Everyone from across the bridge,
follow me.

836
01:44:07,541 --> 01:44:09,667
Throw down your spears.

837
01:44:09,835 --> 01:44:13,880
Why should we abandon
our homes to protect theirs?

838
01:44:14,715 --> 01:44:18,343
That's right.
We'll protect our homes ourselves.

839
01:44:20,387 --> 01:44:22,013
Stop!

840
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:26,976
Pick up your spears!

841
01:44:27,603 --> 01:44:29,103
Return to your line!

842
01:44:54,922 --> 01:44:57,173
Fall in!

843
01:44:58,092 --> 01:45:00,343
Squad formation!

844
01:45:03,347 --> 01:45:05,807
Where's Yohei gone?

845
01:45:07,184 --> 01:45:08,935
Where the hell's Yohei?

846
01:45:14,441 --> 01:45:17,527
There you are, you idiot!

847
01:45:35,129 --> 01:45:37,338
There are three outlying houses,

848
01:45:38,173 --> 01:45:40,258
but 20 in the village.

849
01:45:41,093 --> 01:45:45,054
We can't risk 20
to save three.

850
01:45:46,307 --> 01:45:50,643
And if this village is destroyed,

851
01:45:51,478 --> 01:45:53,688
those three cannot survive
on their own.

852
01:45:57,735 --> 01:46:01,237
Is that clear?
This is the nature of war:

853
01:46:02,740 --> 01:46:05,575
By protecting others,
you save yourself.

854
01:46:07,536 --> 01:46:10,038
If you only think of yourself,

855
01:46:10,497 --> 01:46:12,707
you'll only destroy yourself.

856
01:46:15,794 --> 01:46:19,589
From this day forward,
anyone caught doing that...

857
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:49,786
INTERMISSION

858
01:52:49,271 --> 01:52:50,896
Hot damn!

859
01:52:51,064 --> 01:52:52,898
Look at all those girls!

860
01:52:53,150 --> 01:52:54,525
Hey, Yohei!

861
01:53:00,073 --> 01:53:02,867
Where the hell
have you been hiding these girls?

862
01:53:07,164 --> 01:53:08,956
You devil.

863
01:53:16,757 --> 01:53:19,049
Hey, lend me your scythe.

864
01:53:20,218 --> 01:53:22,261
I'll cut three times your share.

865
01:53:22,429 --> 01:53:25,473
In return,
we get nice and friendly, eh?

866
01:53:49,498 --> 01:53:50,956
- Rikichi.
- Yes.

867
01:53:52,167 --> 01:53:55,836
It seems the married couples
are the most productive.

868
01:53:56,505 --> 01:53:58,672
Time you got yourself a wife.

869
01:54:02,052 --> 01:54:06,222
Why do you always get so mad?
I just said you should -

870
01:54:07,432 --> 01:54:09,725
Katsushiro, go after him.

871
01:54:09,893 --> 01:54:12,019
Running off at a time like this.

872
01:54:13,188 --> 01:54:14,647
Rikichi!

873
01:54:15,649 --> 01:54:17,107
Rikichi!

874
01:54:21,279 --> 01:54:23,989
Shino, what are you gawking at?

875
01:54:40,090 --> 01:54:43,300
What's this? A bear's den?

876
01:54:45,303 --> 01:54:47,471
This was done with a scythe.

877
01:54:49,599 --> 01:54:50,933
Was it Rikichi?

878
01:54:51,518 --> 01:54:54,019
Yes, though I didn't actually
see him do it.

879
01:54:54,187 --> 01:54:56,397
I lost him for a while,

880
01:54:56,565 --> 01:54:58,482
but then I spotted him
leaving this grove.

881
01:54:58,650 --> 01:55:01,819
He was furious,
soaked in sweat.

882
01:55:05,407 --> 01:55:07,074
What did you say to him?

883
01:55:07,242 --> 01:55:10,744
Nothing. Just that he should
hurry up and find a wife.

884
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:18,252
Something's upsetting the little bugger,
but he won't say what.

885
01:55:18,712 --> 01:55:21,130
You can see it
all over his face.

886
01:55:21,923 --> 01:55:27,511
Those lips of his
are bolted up tight as a house.

887
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:30,097
Why don't you try to open them up?

888
01:55:37,480 --> 01:55:38,397
Who's there?

889
01:55:38,565 --> 01:55:39,857
<i>It's me.</i>

890
01:55:42,193 --> 01:55:44,737
All clear?
- Yes.

891
01:55:52,120 --> 01:55:56,123
Have a seat.
Let's have a little chat.

892
01:56:01,296 --> 01:56:04,840
I think talking...

893
01:56:05,508 --> 01:56:07,384
is a good thing.

894
01:56:07,928 --> 01:56:11,972
Whatever your burden may be,
talking can ease it.

895
01:56:15,143 --> 01:56:19,063
You, for example,
seem pretty tight-lipped,

896
01:56:19,481 --> 01:56:24,193
but if you're suffering,
you shouldn't bottle it up.

897
01:56:26,947 --> 01:56:31,492
Letting out your feelings
bit by bit can work wonders.

898
01:56:32,702 --> 01:56:35,371
I've got nothing to say.

899
01:56:52,973 --> 01:56:54,848
Time to head out.

900
01:56:57,352 --> 01:56:58,435
Shall we wake him?

901
01:56:58,603 --> 01:57:00,813
No, let the kid sleep.

902
01:57:04,734 --> 01:57:06,193
Shino.

903
01:57:08,947 --> 01:57:11,031
I swear he just said "Shino."

904
01:57:14,035 --> 01:57:15,911
Sounds like a woman's name.

905
01:57:16,079 --> 01:57:18,914
Even kids can be charmers
in their dreams.

906
01:57:25,296 --> 01:57:27,840
Where shall we start our rounds?

907
01:57:28,008 --> 01:57:31,218
The place that worries us most,
of course.

908
01:58:28,568 --> 01:58:30,069
Who's there?

909
01:58:36,868 --> 01:58:38,410
Who's there?

910
01:58:38,953 --> 01:58:40,621
Come out here!

911
01:58:41,331 --> 01:58:42,331
Who's there?

912
01:58:42,499 --> 01:58:43,957
Kikuchiyo.

913
01:58:46,294 --> 01:58:48,378
You're lucky it was us.

914
01:58:48,755 --> 01:58:51,924
If we'd been bandits,
you'd be headless right now.

915
01:59:23,915 --> 01:59:25,457
Yohei.

916
01:59:26,835 --> 01:59:28,544
What's this?

917
01:59:28,837 --> 01:59:30,963
That's my horse, sir.

918
01:59:33,258 --> 01:59:36,093
I thought it was a big old mouse.

919
02:00:15,717 --> 02:00:19,803
<i>The sparrows chirp, chirp, chirp</i>

920
02:00:20,722 --> 02:00:24,558
<i>The crows caw, caw, caw</i>

921
02:00:28,354 --> 02:00:31,648
I wonder why
the bandits aren't coming.

922
02:00:33,943 --> 02:00:39,406
What a waste if they don't.
Think how much we feed those samurai.

923
02:00:39,574 --> 02:00:43,368
Idiot!
It's best if they don't come!

924
02:00:49,918 --> 02:00:53,170
A nag like that
can't carry your weight!

925
02:00:53,338 --> 02:00:56,632
Yohei's horse is too worn out.

926
02:00:58,718 --> 02:01:01,845
Please stop. Yohei'll be in tears
if you break its leg.

927
02:01:02,013 --> 02:01:05,599
A skilled horseman
can make even a nag soar into the sky.

928
02:01:17,570 --> 02:01:18,820
Not bad.

929
02:01:34,545 --> 02:01:36,505
Very fine indeed!

930
02:02:00,488 --> 02:02:02,572
They seem to be having fun.

931
02:02:04,117 --> 02:02:06,994
The threshing's done,
and still no bandits.

932
02:02:07,412 --> 02:02:10,831
Everyone's saying
they might not come after all.

933
02:02:12,041 --> 02:02:14,334
A tempting thought.

934
02:02:14,836 --> 02:02:20,048
But when you think you're safe
is precisely when you're most vulnerable.

935
02:02:21,342 --> 02:02:23,760
Send them back
to their posts.

936
02:02:57,211 --> 02:03:00,964
I wish I'd been born
into a samurai family.

937
02:03:04,052 --> 02:03:06,053
A farmer's life is too cruel.

938
02:03:07,138 --> 02:03:10,223
My life has been so easy,
I'm ashamed.

939
02:03:10,391 --> 02:03:12,726
That's not what I meant.

940
02:03:13,061 --> 02:03:17,564
It's because you're a samurai
and I'm a farmer.

941
02:03:17,732 --> 02:03:19,191
But I don't -

942
02:03:19,359 --> 02:03:22,611
It's all right. I don't mind.
We can't know

943
02:03:22,779 --> 02:03:24,988
what the future holds!

944
02:03:58,272 --> 02:04:01,525
Coward!
Act like a samurai!

945
02:05:08,551 --> 02:05:11,344
Three suspicious characters
on the western road.

946
02:05:13,764 --> 02:05:16,558
- The villagers haven't noticed?
- Not yet.

947
02:05:16,726 --> 02:05:18,810
We can't have them
sounding the alarm.

948
02:05:21,189 --> 02:05:24,107
I saw three horses
up in the hills.

949
02:05:24,275 --> 02:05:27,194
I think they're bandits.
- We know.

950
02:05:31,866 --> 02:05:34,117
- So they're here.
- How did you know?

951
02:05:34,285 --> 02:05:37,496
How could I not?
This one here was in such a panic.

952
02:05:40,875 --> 02:05:43,543
Where are they coming from?
The mountains or the west?

953
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:47,380
The west.

954
02:05:56,057 --> 02:05:56,932
Bandits!

955
02:06:01,437 --> 02:06:04,564
Send everyone to their houses.
There are only three of them.

956
02:06:04,732 --> 02:06:07,526
Tell them to keep quiet
no matter what.

957
02:06:07,693 --> 02:06:12,072
They're probably scouts.
We can't let them see any samurai.

958
02:06:29,257 --> 02:06:31,424
What is it?

959
02:06:31,801 --> 02:06:33,593
Bandits?

960
02:06:36,264 --> 02:06:39,307
Bandits, eh?
Where are they?

961
02:06:50,945 --> 02:06:52,279
Quiet!

962
02:06:54,282 --> 02:06:56,157
Where are they, Shichiroji?

963
02:06:56,325 --> 02:06:59,077
Beyond the fence.

964
02:07:13,467 --> 02:07:16,052
No doubt about it - they're scouts.

965
02:07:16,554 --> 02:07:18,471
The fence took them by surprise.

966
02:07:19,557 --> 02:07:21,975
They don't seem
to realize we're here.

967
02:07:22,143 --> 02:07:25,270
With luck they'll report
there are only farmers here.

968
02:07:26,814 --> 02:07:29,399
<i>Hey, where is everyone?</i>

969
02:07:29,567 --> 02:07:31,276
That idiot!

970
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:34,237
Kikuchiyo!

971
02:07:40,453 --> 02:07:42,829
Hey, I hear the bandits are here.

972
02:07:44,498 --> 02:07:45,290
You fool.

973
02:07:45,458 --> 02:07:47,792
Too late.
They've seen us.

974
02:07:58,638 --> 02:08:02,182
If they report back that samurai
are here, we're finished.

975
02:08:03,017 --> 02:08:06,186
I'll kill them.
The mountain's my territory.

976
02:08:06,479 --> 02:08:07,520
I was just -

977
02:08:07,688 --> 02:08:11,483
Enough. You can make up for it
by getting one.

978
02:08:11,651 --> 02:08:13,026
Head them off at -

979
02:08:13,194 --> 02:08:16,071
I know, at their horses.
Take us there.

980
02:08:17,198 --> 02:08:18,823
Katsushiro!

981
02:08:19,659 --> 02:08:22,202
Just watch, you understand?

982
02:08:29,251 --> 02:08:31,461
Those are some horses!

983
02:08:36,258 --> 02:08:38,176
Wait in this hollow.

984
02:08:47,061 --> 02:08:49,771
- What do you plan to do?
- Who, me?

985
02:10:50,184 --> 02:10:52,352
Katsushiro.

986
02:10:53,187 --> 02:10:55,396
You can come out now.

987
02:10:58,692 --> 02:11:00,568
Help me!

988
02:11:19,630 --> 02:11:21,381
Back off!

989
02:11:22,675 --> 02:11:26,970
He's a captive who has confessed.
He's begging for his life.

990
02:11:27,137 --> 02:11:30,598
You can't just
chop him to pieces.

991
02:11:31,892 --> 02:11:33,142
Stay out of this!

992
02:11:34,895 --> 02:11:37,105
Let me do it! Scum!

993
02:11:55,165 --> 02:11:56,958
All right.

994
02:11:57,418 --> 02:12:00,086
Let her avenge her son's death.

995
02:12:02,381 --> 02:12:05,133
Someone help her!

996
02:12:05,301 --> 02:12:06,926
I'll do it!

997
02:12:15,769 --> 02:12:19,564
- That bandit said their fort -
- It's hardly a fort.

998
02:12:19,732 --> 02:12:23,610
It's full of holes,
like Yohei's underwear.

999
02:12:23,777 --> 02:12:26,112
- Easy to sneak in.
- Let's attack at night.

1000
02:12:26,280 --> 02:12:29,866
They have 40 men.
We'd usually pick off a few first.

1001
02:12:30,034 --> 02:12:32,994
Wait. We can't afford
to lose a single man,

1002
02:12:33,162 --> 02:12:35,622
even if we kill five
for every one lost.

1003
02:12:35,789 --> 02:12:40,335
- War is always a gamble.
- Three of us can take 10 of them.

1004
02:12:41,337 --> 02:12:42,879
Rikichi.

1005
02:12:43,047 --> 02:12:46,007
How far away is their hideout?

1006
02:12:46,175 --> 02:12:47,675
At least a day.

1007
02:12:47,843 --> 02:12:50,678
Hey, we've got
three of their horses.

1008
02:12:50,846 --> 02:12:52,972
Half a day by horse.

1009
02:13:04,985 --> 02:13:06,611
Very well. Let's do it.

1010
02:13:06,779 --> 02:13:09,739
If we leave now,
we'll arrive before dawn.

1011
02:13:09,907 --> 02:13:11,658
But who should go?

1012
02:13:14,828 --> 02:13:15,995
Not you.

1013
02:13:18,707 --> 02:13:21,042
And me makes three.

1014
02:13:21,919 --> 02:13:23,836
They need a guide!

1015
02:13:24,004 --> 02:13:26,422
There aren't enough horses.

1016
02:13:26,590 --> 02:13:28,675
There's Yohei's horse.
You ride that.

1017
02:13:28,842 --> 02:13:31,052
The only man
to master that steed

1018
02:13:31,220 --> 02:13:32,845
is Lord Kikuchiyo himself.

1019
02:13:41,897 --> 02:13:44,107
Whoa! What the hell?

1020
02:13:44,942 --> 02:13:47,151
It's the other way!

1021
02:13:49,571 --> 02:13:51,447
Stupid horse!

1022
02:13:52,074 --> 02:13:56,035
This way, you useless mule!

1023
02:13:56,787 --> 02:13:59,372
You call yourself a horse?

1024
02:13:59,540 --> 02:14:01,708
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

1025
02:14:03,585 --> 02:14:05,420
Hey, wait!

1026
02:14:07,715 --> 02:14:11,551
Please stop! I apologize!

1027
02:14:11,719 --> 02:14:13,219
I'm sorry!

1028
02:15:39,765 --> 02:15:42,225
Hey, let's set the place on fire!

1029
02:15:42,392 --> 02:15:44,310
Cut 'em down as they run out!

1030
02:18:18,632 --> 02:18:20,633
Serves you right!

1031
02:18:21,260 --> 02:18:23,010
We did it!

1032
02:18:25,472 --> 02:18:27,431
Take that, you sons of bitches!

1033
02:19:10,434 --> 02:19:11,767
Heihachi!

1034
02:19:32,581 --> 02:19:34,915
Are you crazy?

1035
02:19:50,682 --> 02:19:51,932
Stupid idiot!

1036
02:19:52,100 --> 02:19:55,353
Look what you've done!
Who is she to you?

1037
02:19:56,730 --> 02:19:59,065
She's my wife!

1038
02:20:02,652 --> 02:20:05,404
Heihachi, hang on!

1039
02:20:44,611 --> 02:20:46,278
You said...

1040
02:20:48,240 --> 02:20:51,283
he'd be a treasure
in hard times.

1041
02:20:53,036 --> 02:20:55,413
The hard times
have only just begun.

1042
02:21:05,507 --> 02:21:06,799
Stop crying!

1043
02:21:07,467 --> 02:21:09,552
Damn fool!

1044
02:21:10,804 --> 02:21:12,471
Stop crying!

1045
02:22:40,352 --> 02:22:42,478
Goddamn!
Here they come!

1046
02:23:55,677 --> 02:23:59,471
Take note:
They have three muskets.

1047
02:24:25,123 --> 02:24:27,333
Twenty riders bound north,
13 south.

1048
02:24:27,500 --> 02:24:29,668
- Muskets?
- Three in all.

1049
02:24:30,837 --> 02:24:33,839
Take the south, and watch out
for those muskets.

1050
02:25:30,146 --> 02:25:32,481
Retreat! Retreat!

1051
02:25:48,081 --> 02:25:51,625
- The 12 headed south have turned east.
- Wasn't that 13?

1052
02:25:51,835 --> 02:25:53,794
An arrow got one of them.

1053
02:25:53,962 --> 02:25:55,546
Good old Gorobei.

1054
02:25:58,299 --> 02:26:01,593
Make sure the eastern bridge is out,
and watch out for -

1055
02:26:01,761 --> 02:26:03,303
The muskets!

1056
02:26:12,355 --> 02:26:15,941
Take the north.
That's where we'll battle it out.

1057
02:26:16,901 --> 02:26:20,362
If you knew that, why didn't
you build a fence there too?

1058
02:26:20,530 --> 02:26:22,948
Every great castle
needs a breach.

1059
02:26:23,116 --> 02:26:27,411
Draw the enemy there and attack.
You can't win by defense alone.

1060
02:26:39,132 --> 02:26:41,300
Use your balls,
if you've got any!

1061
02:26:45,388 --> 02:26:47,931
Take it away, damn it!

1062
02:26:51,478 --> 02:26:54,188
Twelve riders are on the way.
Hurry with the bridge!

1063
02:26:54,397 --> 02:26:57,107
Are you blind?
What do you think we're doing?

1064
02:26:59,027 --> 02:27:01,445
And he said
to watch out for the muskets.

1065
02:27:01,613 --> 02:27:03,655
What kinda idiot
you take me for?

1066
02:27:10,246 --> 02:27:11,622
Where are you going?

1067
02:27:11,790 --> 02:27:14,625
We're looking for Father.
We can't find him anywhere.

1068
02:27:14,918 --> 02:27:19,505
Father intends to die in that barn.
That's what he's always wanted.

1069
02:27:25,220 --> 02:27:27,387
Stubborn old fool!

1070
02:27:27,889 --> 02:27:30,098
Hurry up and get him!

1071
02:27:33,686 --> 02:27:35,729
Get out of our way!

1072
02:27:36,689 --> 02:27:40,025
What are you doing?
Hurry up!

1073
02:28:01,798 --> 02:28:04,132
- On this mountain -
- Twenty riders.

1074
02:28:04,551 --> 02:28:07,135
And 12 to the east.

1075
02:28:07,303 --> 02:28:08,720
Right.

1076
02:28:24,529 --> 02:28:27,656
This won't do.
They're all scared stiff.

1077
02:28:31,494 --> 02:28:33,078
Good! Again!

1078
02:28:34,664 --> 02:28:36,248
Again!

1079
02:28:39,544 --> 02:28:42,754
Shichiroji's at it.
Let's fire ours up too.

1080
02:28:44,257 --> 02:28:45,966
Everybody out here!

1081
02:28:51,222 --> 02:28:53,724
Raise your spears
and give the battle cry.

1082
02:28:58,354 --> 02:28:59,271
Again!

1083
02:29:03,610 --> 02:29:06,570
Damn 'em, listen to that!
We can beat 'em!

1084
02:29:10,450 --> 02:29:13,118
Yohei, what's that look for?
Again!

1085
02:29:18,291 --> 02:29:20,250
Take cover!

1086
02:29:24,964 --> 02:29:26,840
Here they come!

1087
02:29:43,483 --> 02:29:44,900
Goddamn 'em!

1088
02:30:21,187 --> 02:30:24,314
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

1089
02:30:28,695 --> 02:30:30,904
Oh, no, you don't!

1090
02:30:35,702 --> 02:30:37,285
Don't panic!

1091
02:30:46,212 --> 02:30:48,630
Goddamn you!

1092
02:30:52,719 --> 02:30:54,177
They're burning!

1093
02:30:54,554 --> 02:30:56,471
Damn bastards!

1094
02:31:26,252 --> 02:31:29,337
Back to your posts, everyone!

1095
02:31:30,506 --> 02:31:32,215
Dear!

1096
02:31:34,135 --> 02:31:36,887
They're just rickety shacks!

1097
02:31:39,807 --> 02:31:42,809
Everybody, back to your posts!

1098
02:31:54,280 --> 02:31:55,822
Goddamn it!

1099
02:31:57,533 --> 02:31:59,284
You dogs!

1100
02:31:59,535 --> 02:32:02,120
That's the Old Man's house!

1101
02:32:04,665 --> 02:32:07,375
Where's the Old Man?
What about that couple?

1102
02:32:07,835 --> 02:32:10,837
And the little brat?
What the hell's going on?

1103
02:32:13,925 --> 02:32:16,885
Stop!
You can't abandon your post!

1104
02:32:18,805 --> 02:32:20,889
Kikuchiyo, come back!

1105
02:32:22,975 --> 02:32:24,476
Kikuchiyo!

1106
02:32:39,659 --> 02:32:42,452
Where's the Old Man
and your husband?

1107
02:32:52,421 --> 02:32:55,382
She's been speared.
How'd she make it this far?

1108
02:33:01,848 --> 02:33:03,765
Let's go!

1109
02:33:10,356 --> 02:33:12,482
Damn it, what is it now?

1110
02:33:15,695 --> 02:33:18,363
This baby... is me.

1111
02:33:18,865 --> 02:33:21,366
This is just
what happened to me!

1112
02:34:30,144 --> 02:34:32,062
Here we go!

1113
02:34:40,780 --> 02:34:42,864
What the hell?

1114
02:34:57,129 --> 02:34:59,631
What the hell
were you staring at?

1115
02:35:00,800 --> 02:35:02,384
Idiot!

1116
02:36:04,697 --> 02:36:06,740
No one wounded?

1117
02:36:07,116 --> 02:36:09,576
Good.
You did a fine job.

1118
02:36:09,744 --> 02:36:11,411
Fine job!

1119
02:36:14,749 --> 02:36:17,000
Gunpowder!
Take cover!

1120
02:36:27,511 --> 02:36:29,220
Manzo!

1121
02:36:42,985 --> 02:36:44,944
Where were you hit?

1122
02:36:45,446 --> 02:36:48,615
Shino! Shino!
Bring me my daughter.

1123
02:36:49,825 --> 02:36:51,242
Don't bother.

1124
02:36:51,619 --> 02:36:54,537
If this kills you,
you'd die of a fleabite.

1125
02:36:55,748 --> 02:36:58,333
You make a ruckus
over a little scratch

1126
02:36:58,501 --> 02:37:02,379
and blow your daughter's cover
in the process. Nice going!

1127
02:37:31,742 --> 02:37:33,993
You don't have
to chase them all down.

1128
02:37:37,456 --> 02:37:39,499
That's far enough.
Well done.

1129
02:37:40,251 --> 02:37:42,168
Who are you?

1130
02:37:44,046 --> 02:37:45,797
Rikichi.

1131
02:38:00,771 --> 02:38:03,314
They've attacked from the east,
west and south

1132
02:38:03,482 --> 02:38:06,443
and run away each time
with their tails between their legs.

1133
02:38:06,610 --> 02:38:08,361
This is the only approach left.

1134
02:38:08,529 --> 02:38:11,156
We don't know
if they'll come tonight,

1135
02:38:11,323 --> 02:38:13,450
but when they do,
they'll mass their forces here.

1136
02:38:13,617 --> 02:38:15,326
Perhaps, but...

1137
02:38:15,995 --> 02:38:18,079
I don't hear a thing.

1138
02:38:31,177 --> 02:38:32,886
Nevertheless,

1139
02:38:33,637 --> 02:38:35,972
this will surely
be the focus of their attack.

1140
02:38:36,390 --> 02:38:38,349
I'll prove it to you in a minute.

1141
02:39:22,353 --> 02:39:23,728
Good work.

1142
02:39:23,896 --> 02:39:26,940
Now poke that scarecrow out
from behind those trees.

1143
02:40:01,475 --> 02:40:04,602
I'd say tomorrow morning

1144
02:40:04,895 --> 02:40:07,397
they'll attack us here
with everything they've got.

1145
02:40:07,565 --> 02:40:10,483
And we'll let them in.

1146
02:40:14,405 --> 02:40:17,574
Don't worry.
I mean we'll let one in.

1147
02:40:18,617 --> 02:40:20,618
Two at most.

1148
02:40:21,620 --> 02:40:25,290
Once they're in,
we form a wall again with our spears.

1149
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,876
The one or two who get in
are as good as dead.

1150
02:40:29,044 --> 02:40:31,129
We can cook 'em up
any way we want.

1151
02:40:33,382 --> 02:40:37,969
We'll pick them off patiently,
one by one, until the final showdown.

1152
02:40:38,137 --> 02:40:40,179
Those muskets worry me.

1153
02:40:40,347 --> 02:40:42,515
If only we could
get one of them.

1154
02:40:45,102 --> 02:40:48,479
I'll go.
I swear I'll get one!

1155
02:40:48,647 --> 02:40:51,566
No. You're looking to die.
I'll go.

1156
02:41:44,703 --> 02:41:46,621
Footsteps! Listen!

1157
02:41:46,789 --> 02:41:50,041
That's enough.
Get some rest.

1158
02:41:50,209 --> 02:41:53,211
It's true! I hear them!
Listen.

1159
02:41:53,379 --> 02:41:55,505
I said enough.

1160
02:41:56,382 --> 02:41:59,509
You're exhausted.
Get some rest.

1161
02:42:02,262 --> 02:42:03,971
I hear them.

1162
02:42:32,126 --> 02:42:33,876
Two more down.

1163
02:43:08,871 --> 02:43:10,079
What is it?

1164
02:43:13,167 --> 02:43:17,295
State your business.
I'm going to get some sleep.

1165
02:43:18,756 --> 02:43:22,258
You are a magnificent person.

1166
02:43:26,638 --> 02:43:30,683
I've wanted to tell you so
for some time.

1167
02:43:56,668 --> 02:43:58,419
They're here.

1168
02:44:02,508 --> 02:44:04,509
We'll let one in.

1169
02:44:07,304 --> 02:44:09,263
We're letting one in!

1170
02:44:16,688 --> 02:44:21,192
Remember, after the first one's in,
jump out with your spears.

1171
02:44:40,087 --> 02:44:41,337
Here they come.

1172
02:45:17,291 --> 02:45:19,041
Step aside!

1173
02:45:21,587 --> 02:45:23,129
Good work.

1174
02:45:30,846 --> 02:45:33,931
What's wrong? You did well.

1175
02:45:34,433 --> 02:45:36,350
Here he comes! Scatter!

1176
02:45:53,911 --> 02:45:56,120
Fall back! Fall back!

1177
02:46:01,752 --> 02:46:03,836
After them!

1178
02:46:12,137 --> 02:46:13,804
Another on the way!

1179
02:47:56,116 --> 02:47:57,867
Here he comes.

1180
02:48:14,092 --> 02:48:15,926
Watch this!

1181
02:48:21,850 --> 02:48:24,560
Having fun with your horsey?

1182
02:48:46,333 --> 02:48:50,878
They've stopped.
Won't fall for that trick again, eh?

1183
02:48:59,805 --> 02:49:02,973
They're all wimps!
Who's scared of bandits anyway?

1184
02:49:09,898 --> 02:49:15,152
That little skirmish just cost them four.
Kyuzo got two last night.

1185
02:49:31,753 --> 02:49:34,004
That man is a true samurai.

1186
02:49:34,339 --> 02:49:37,007
He's fearless,
his swordsmanship is amazing,

1187
02:49:37,175 --> 02:49:38,884
and yet he's kind too.

1188
02:49:39,052 --> 02:49:42,763
He never once boasted
about capturing that musket.

1189
02:49:43,181 --> 02:49:47,685
He walked into a forest filled with bandits
as if on a mushroom hunt.

1190
02:49:49,062 --> 02:49:53,357
Fascinating.
I'm not bored at all, I swear.

1191
02:50:11,209 --> 02:50:13,127
Hey, Yohei.

1192
02:50:14,004 --> 02:50:15,546
Take over for me.

1193
02:50:18,675 --> 02:50:21,719
What's that face for?

1194
02:50:21,887 --> 02:50:24,054
There's no danger here now.

1195
02:50:25,640 --> 02:50:27,808
You make a great scarecrow.

1196
02:51:59,276 --> 02:52:00,567
Hear me good!

1197
02:52:01,653 --> 02:52:04,029
If anybody else turns yellow -

1198
02:52:10,203 --> 02:52:11,578
Out of my way!

1199
02:53:35,080 --> 02:53:36,330
Hey!

1200
02:53:40,085 --> 02:53:41,251
How's it goin'?

1201
02:53:41,419 --> 02:53:43,462
Man, they're a pain.

1202
02:53:43,755 --> 02:53:45,881
Won't be long now.

1203
02:53:46,299 --> 02:53:49,551
Everything's upside down.

1204
02:53:49,761 --> 02:53:53,597
They burn us out,
and we starve like farmers.

1205
02:53:54,432 --> 02:53:57,267
Quit your moaning.
There are better times ahead.

1206
02:53:57,435 --> 02:53:59,770
Do your part, man.

1207
02:54:39,477 --> 02:54:41,645
Hey, it's me!

1208
02:54:48,903 --> 02:54:50,654
Serves you right, you dogs!

1209
02:54:50,822 --> 02:54:51,822
Fool!

1210
02:54:52,991 --> 02:54:54,992
Why did you leave your post?

1211
02:54:55,160 --> 02:54:56,535
Just look at this!

1212
02:54:56,703 --> 02:55:00,330
Don't scold me, man.
My post is fine.

1213
02:55:01,166 --> 02:55:04,710
There's nothing heroic
about selfishly grabbing for glory.

1214
02:55:04,878 --> 02:55:09,089
Listen to me:
War is not fought alone!

1215
02:55:19,476 --> 02:55:22,519
Gorobei and Kyuzo,
guard this post!

1216
02:55:27,901 --> 02:55:29,943
Let no one pass!

1217
02:57:37,864 --> 02:57:40,657
Stop, you asses!

1218
02:57:40,825 --> 02:57:42,534
Damn you!

1219
02:57:43,161 --> 02:57:45,162
Damn it! Two made it in!

1220
02:58:00,845 --> 02:58:03,889
Goddamn it!

1221
02:58:04,599 --> 02:58:06,183
Where's Yohei?

1222
02:58:46,182 --> 02:58:47,516
Yohei!

1223
02:58:49,143 --> 02:58:50,560
Yohei!

1224
02:58:51,062 --> 02:58:54,189
I defended my post.

1225
02:58:54,357 --> 02:58:57,025
Don't give up, Yohei!

1226
02:59:00,405 --> 02:59:02,239
Go ahead, shoot me!

1227
02:59:40,278 --> 02:59:41,987
Shichiroji, take over!

1228
02:59:53,249 --> 02:59:55,125
Gorobei!

1229
03:00:04,802 --> 03:00:06,803
Gorobei!

1230
03:00:58,731 --> 03:01:01,024
Just 13 left.

1231
03:01:01,609 --> 03:01:03,652
But these last seven...

1232
03:01:04,904 --> 03:01:07,030
came at a steep price.

1233
03:01:28,219 --> 03:01:30,887
How are you? Tired?

1234
03:01:32,807 --> 03:01:36,726
Poor man.
You've lost a lot of weight.

1235
03:01:40,898 --> 03:01:43,441
I'll go throw
some water on my face.

1236
03:01:54,036 --> 03:01:56,746
Next time they come,
we fight to the finish.

1237
03:01:56,914 --> 03:02:01,167
It's better we fight it out
before we're spent.

1238
03:02:01,419 --> 03:02:04,963
When do you think
they'll attack?

1239
03:02:06,382 --> 03:02:09,384
They're exhausted too,
and a few are wounded.

1240
03:02:09,802 --> 03:02:11,928
They won't come tonight.

1241
03:02:12,096 --> 03:02:17,309
But they have no food,
and their ranks are splitting.

1242
03:02:18,227 --> 03:02:20,312
They can't afford
to dawdle either.

1243
03:02:20,563 --> 03:02:26,735
I say they'll come at us like hell
tomorrow morning.

1244
03:02:28,112 --> 03:02:29,779
Katsushiro.

1245
03:02:49,258 --> 03:02:50,759
An order from above.

1246
03:02:50,927 --> 03:02:54,095
Place two on watch
and let the rest sleep.

1247
03:02:54,805 --> 03:02:58,808
The men may visit their families
one at a time.

1248
03:03:00,603 --> 03:03:02,145
So tomorrow's the showdown?

1249
03:03:04,148 --> 03:03:06,358
Yes.
Please carry out the order.

1250
03:03:13,074 --> 03:03:16,868
You all heard what he just said.

1251
03:03:20,873 --> 03:03:23,291
I'll stand guard.

1252
03:03:23,918 --> 03:03:25,794
The rest of you sleep.

1253
03:03:26,837 --> 03:03:30,006
Manzo...

1254
03:03:30,800 --> 03:03:32,842
you go home first.

1255
03:03:33,260 --> 03:03:35,679
Take a good look
at your daughter -

1256
03:03:36,472 --> 03:03:38,723
I mean, your son.

1257
03:03:47,733 --> 03:03:49,025
I told them.

1258
03:03:49,193 --> 03:03:51,361
All right. Get some rest.

1259
03:03:55,408 --> 03:03:57,742
Katsushiro.

1260
03:03:58,703 --> 03:04:00,245
How was Kikuchiyo?

1261
03:04:00,413 --> 03:04:03,498
Still beside the grave.

1262
03:04:03,749 --> 03:04:05,041
I see.

1263
03:05:18,365 --> 03:05:21,201
Are we all going
to die tomorrow?

1264
03:05:21,368 --> 03:05:24,454
There's no way to know.

1265
03:05:25,081 --> 03:05:27,624
But we might!

1266
03:05:49,855 --> 03:05:51,272
Shino.

1267
03:05:51,899 --> 03:05:53,566
Where's Shino?

1268
03:05:59,240 --> 03:06:00,824
Anyone seen Shino?

1269
03:06:35,276 --> 03:06:37,861
Sake, eh?
Where'd you find it?

1270
03:06:53,169 --> 03:06:56,212
I see. They have stockpiles,
just like Kikuchiyo said,

1271
03:06:56,380 --> 03:06:58,381
and tonight it all comes out.

1272
03:07:07,766 --> 03:07:10,393
I think I'll help myself.

1273
03:07:14,106 --> 03:07:15,690
Shino!

1274
03:07:41,467 --> 03:07:44,552
Here's some sake.
Drink up and get some sleep.

1275
03:07:49,808 --> 03:07:54,103
This is hardly like you.
You must rest for the battle tomorrow.

1276
03:08:05,658 --> 03:08:07,742
Shino!

1277
03:09:12,891 --> 03:09:14,767
<i>You tramp!</i>

1278
03:09:24,236 --> 03:09:27,322
You wench!

1279
03:09:31,201 --> 03:09:33,369
Stop this brutality!

1280
03:09:33,537 --> 03:09:37,874
What the hell's a farmer girl
doing with a samurai?

1281
03:10:03,317 --> 03:10:04,984
You slut!

1282
03:10:15,120 --> 03:10:16,704
Manzo.

1283
03:10:17,581 --> 03:10:20,083
Is this your daughter?

1284
03:10:26,548 --> 03:10:28,424
Tell me what happened.

1285
03:10:28,592 --> 03:10:32,929
You mentioned a samurai.
Who was it?

1286
03:10:34,515 --> 03:10:36,057
Manzo!

1287
03:10:45,776 --> 03:10:47,610
Manzo, say something.

1288
03:10:48,695 --> 03:10:50,279
Speak!

1289
03:11:22,646 --> 03:11:24,814
Are you Shino?

1290
03:11:44,042 --> 03:11:47,253
Manzo, don't be angry.

1291
03:11:48,714 --> 03:11:51,799
When the dawn threatens
our very lives,

1292
03:11:51,967 --> 03:11:55,303
the weight of it
makes us all a little reckless.

1293
03:12:01,143 --> 03:12:03,686
On the eve of decisive battles...

1294
03:12:05,230 --> 03:12:07,982
this often happens,
even inside castles.

1295
03:12:10,861 --> 03:12:14,906
Remember what it was to be young.
You can't blame them.

1296
03:12:15,866 --> 03:12:17,950
I can't forgive them.

1297
03:12:18,202 --> 03:12:21,370
I can't stand by when my only daughter
has been made damaged goods.

1298
03:12:35,928 --> 03:12:40,556
What's wrong with two people in love?
It's not like bandits took her!

1299
03:14:12,983 --> 03:14:17,236
They're wound up tight.
We need to loosen them up.

1300
03:14:25,329 --> 03:14:28,581
Everyone, the final battle
is here at last.

1301
03:14:31,585 --> 03:14:35,838
By the way, Katsushiro,
we expect much of you today.

1302
03:14:37,591 --> 03:14:40,676
As of last night,
you became a real man.

1303
03:14:58,695 --> 03:15:00,237
Hey!

1304
03:15:03,200 --> 03:15:06,327
Where's that fighting spirit?

1305
03:15:08,080 --> 03:15:11,666
You'll never win
with such long faces!

1306
03:15:25,222 --> 03:15:27,390
Kikuchiyo, what are you up to?

1307
03:15:27,557 --> 03:15:29,892
I can't kill five
with just one blade.

1308
03:15:45,575 --> 03:15:47,493
There are 13 left.

1309
03:15:48,662 --> 03:15:52,623
We'll let them all in.

1310
03:15:54,209 --> 03:15:56,627
Once they pass this point,

1311
03:15:57,129 --> 03:16:01,006
we close in from all sides
at the crossing.

1312
03:16:03,927 --> 03:16:08,055
Everything's riding
on this battle!

1313
03:16:38,336 --> 03:16:40,588
Here they come!

1314
03:17:03,904 --> 03:17:06,155
Here they come!

1315
03:17:30,597 --> 03:17:32,807
Shichiroji and Katsushiro,
go west!

1316
03:17:33,058 --> 03:17:35,351
Kyuzo, Kikuchiyo, east!

1317
03:19:16,828 --> 03:19:19,788
Katsushiro! Rikichi!

1318
03:19:19,956 --> 03:19:22,625
East! Go east!

1319
03:19:22,792 --> 03:19:24,668
East!

1320
03:19:41,728 --> 03:19:43,520
Shut up!

1321
03:19:43,980 --> 03:19:46,190
Scream and you're dead!

1322
03:20:33,571 --> 03:20:34,780
We did it!

1323
03:20:34,948 --> 03:20:36,281
We did it!

1324
03:20:36,449 --> 03:20:39,201
Head east!

1325
03:20:54,551 --> 03:20:56,927
Katsushiro, pull back!

1326
03:20:59,431 --> 03:21:01,682
Damn you!

1327
03:21:03,393 --> 03:21:04,852
Kikuchiyo!

1328
03:21:41,014 --> 03:21:43,140
Kikuchiyo!

1329
03:21:53,526 --> 03:21:56,612
Where are the bandits?

1330
03:21:56,780 --> 03:21:58,781
They're all dead!

1331
03:22:17,092 --> 03:22:19,927
Once more we survive.

1332
03:25:58,104 --> 03:26:01,815
In the end,
we lost this battle too.

1333
03:26:02,692 --> 03:26:03,942
What?

1334
03:26:04,777 --> 03:26:06,403
I mean,

1335
03:26:06,779 --> 03:26:09,364
the victory belongs to those peasants.

1336
03:26:10,658 --> 03:26:12,492
Not to us.

1337
03:26:41,731 --> 03:26:46,610
THE END
