1
00:00:38,207 --> 00:00:40,958
<i><i>And now,
some tragic local news.</i></i>

2
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,460
<i>We have a report of another murder tonight.</i>

3
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:46,672
<i>A young girl has been found dead
in Rogers Park.</i>

4
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,966
<i>The body was badly mutilated.</i>

5
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,175
<i>Because of these murders,</i>

6
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:54,471
<i>police request that all women stay inside
their homes after dark.</i>

7
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:57,599
<i>If you must go out,
please have someone accompany you.</i>

8
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:00,811
<i>Keep your door locked. We'll repeat that.</i>

9
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:05,983
<i>Police request that all women stay inside
their homes after dark,</i>

10
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,776
if you must go out...

11
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,926
Pete, this is the worst yet.

12
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,346
I don't know what to make of it.

13
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:28,268
Seven killings in two weeks. Young girls.

14
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,521
And each killing more
brutal than the other.

15
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,650
This lab report doesn't mean anything.

16
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:40,489
We went over that last girl's apartment
with a fine-toothed comb.

17
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,618
The body looked like Jack the Ripper
had got to her.

18
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:49,039
There should have been clues
all over the place...

19
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,249
And we couldn't come up with one.

20
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,878
Yeah, and the DA's office
is getting hot too, Chief.

21
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:01,718
Well, we're just working
with a homicidal maniac, that's all.

22
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,846
But there's more to
this than just a maniac...

23
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,516
There is a pattern.

24
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:12,395
Now, all these bodies
have been badly mutilated,

25
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,065
certain limbs and organs have been removed.

26
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,401
This, er, Pat Tracy
that we found yesterday,

27
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,863
the lab says her heart was cut out.

28
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,242
Gives me the chills just to think of it.

29
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,911
Yeah, the newspapers are really playing
this one up, too.

30
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:33,291
Well, Frank, this
looks like one of those long, hard ones.

31
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,795
I know what you mean. Oh, Pete...

32
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,923
Call the radio and television stations.

33
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:44,511
Have them repeat
those emergency broadcasts every half hour.

34
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,765
I wanna make sure every woman in this town
hears those broadcasts.

35
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,103
Well, you better get going.
I've got some reports to go over.

36
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,604
Okay, Chief.

37
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,420
Good day! Are you Mr. Ramses?
I'm Dorothy Fremont.

38
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,423
Er, well...

39
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:25,093
I heard about you from a friend of mine,
Annette Dupree.

40
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,555
I'm giving a dinner party in two weeks
for my daughter

41
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:32,976
and Mrs. Dupree said that you cater
to just the type of thing I'm looking for.

42
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:37,939
I want, er, something unusual,
something totally different.

43
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,693
Yes, Mrs. Fremont,

44
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:45,906
I do cater to unusual affairs.

45
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,618
What do you consider to be unusual?

46
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:54,080
Oh, I don't know.
What do you recommend?

47
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:59,336
Have you ever had an Egyptian feast?

48
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,506
Why, that would be fine!
That would be perfect!

49
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,469
My daughter Suzette is a student
of Egyptian culture.

50
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,555
Mr. Ramses, she'd just love it!

51
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,307
An Egyptian feast!

52
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,603
Yes, an authentic dinner,

53
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:21,650
such as one might have attended
in Ancient Egypt.

54
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:26,696
The actual feast of an ancient pharaoh.

55
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,699
It has not been served

56
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:34,371
for 5,000 years.

57
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,501
Yes.

58
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,045
Yes.

59
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,048
We must do it.

60
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,556
Mrs. Fremont...

61
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,560
I am honored that you are requesting
my services.

62
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:02,899
You see, this type of affair
is my specialty.

63
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:08,822
So, you see, I shall cook
your daughter's dinner for you.

64
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:12,450
Oh, that will be wonderful!
Now, I'm depending on you.

65
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:16,246
I want Suzette to have a party
that will be the talk of the town.

66
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,249
Every dish must be authentic.

67
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:23,128
It's a surprise for Suzette and
I do want it to be successful.

68
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:28,675
Your dinner will indeed
be a success, Mrs. Fremont.

69
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,885
I promise you.

70
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:36,641
Things will be arranged
just as the feast of the goddess

71
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:40,562
was given 5,000 years ago.

72
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,983
Erm, "goddess", Mr. Ramses?
I don't think I understand.

73
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:50,864
I only meant that I will arrange things
to suit your taste, Mrs. Fremont.

74
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:54,784
Oh, well, that's fine,
then I can leave everything in your hands.

75
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:58,121
Now, this is my card.
The name and address are right there.

76
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:01,624
I'm mailing out invitations
for two weeks from Saturday night.

77
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,252
You can have things ready by then?

78
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:08,882
Things have been ready
for a long time, Mrs. Fremont.

79
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,550
A long time.

80
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,219
- Er, I beg your pardon?
- Er...

81
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,640
Er, oh, well, then. Good day, Mr. Ramses.

82
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,935
Two weeks from Saturday night.
Er, 6:30 sharp.

83
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,010
Oh, my Ishtar.

84
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,929
My goddess.

85
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:41,015
At last, you have signalled me to begin.

86
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,395
Oh, divine and wondrous
one of the veiled light.

87
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:51,317
At last, Shamash shall visit you
in the feast of your love.

88
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,071
Oh, my goddess,

89
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:59,242
I am your slave, my lady of the dark moon.

90
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:34,402
A pathological killer on the loose
and we can't find one clue!

91
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:40,033
This man's uncanny,
not one fingerprint, nothing!

92
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:43,036
Did you check
with the girl's neighbors, Pete?

93
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,996
Yeah, Chief, but they heard nothing.

94
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,250
Seems she was a hostess at a restaurant.
Got home every night about 12 o'clock.

95
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,379
Neighbors say she's a quiet girl,
never has any friends over.

96
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,840
Then I went down there
and I spoke to her boss.

97
00:11:55,924 --> 00:12:00,220
She said, er, she has no boyfriend at all
but all the people seem to like her.

98
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,932
And the only thing she seemed
to have an active part in

99
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,434
was a book club she belonged to.

100
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,646
Well, stay on it, Pete.

101
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:14,317
Look, we have the police for 200 miles
around on this.

102
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,778
Every street is patrolled.

103
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,822
We sure should get
him if he tries it again.

104
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:24,035
Look, I got to go over to the morgue.
You get to work.

105
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,844
Tony!

106
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:47,517
It's getting late.
Shouldn't we be getting back?

107
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,522
- Mum will worry about me when it gets dark.
- Relax, hun.

108
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,316
Just a while longer.

109
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,945
Your folks know you're in good hands.

110
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,407
Besides...

111
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,409
This is when it...

112
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:08,204
- Just starts getting nice.
- I know Tony, but...

113
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:13,042
Well, I feel... I feel...

114
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,419
Funny.

115
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,755
All those murders and everything
around here?

116
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,883
Hey, baby, I'm here.

117
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,887
I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you.

118
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,558
You're my girl, aren't you?

119
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,687
Besides...

120
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,397
It's still early.

121
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,817
Look, we'll go when it gets dark.

122
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,236
I promise.

123
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,781
Now, prove you love me.

124
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,092
Tony!

125
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,640
She wanted to leave!

126
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,685
She was scared!

127
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,938
It's all my fault!

128
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:43,484
I... I made her stay!

129
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:48,865
- It's... It's all my fault!
- Take it easy, Tony.

130
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:53,536
Try to tell us who did it. You must try.

131
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:59,125
- Try to tell us, Tony.
- No! No, sir!

132
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,753
I can't remember!

133
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:06,883
Everything happened so fast!

134
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,640
And then I got her...

135
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:19,854
I can't remember! I can't remember!

136
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,355
Take it easy, son.

137
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,942
Sergeant, take this boy to the hospital.

138
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:28,070
We will want to talk to you later, Tony,
when you've calmed down.

139
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,246
Say, what do you make
of these murders, Frank?

140
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,041
He always kills the same way.

141
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,419
He just takes one part of the body.

142
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,923
This time, he took the brains.

143
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,093
Now, what kind of a creature would do that?

144
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,429
Pathological killer.

145
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,265
Sick, sick mind.

146
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,938
Well, we've gotta notify the parents.
I don't look forward to that.

147
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:07,443
You check on the boy,
find out anything he can remember.

148
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,613
All right, let's get this poor
girl's body down to the morgue.

149
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,908
Officer, go get a
stretcher, will you, please?

150
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,804
Mrs. Franklin...

151
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,975
Have you any idea who could've done this?

152
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:43,104
She was so young! So very young.

153
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,774
Oh, Arthur, why would anyone do this
to our daughter?

154
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,236
Try to control yourself, Molly.

155
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,656
Marcy was a good girl.

156
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:56,117
She'd want us to help the police.

157
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,912
We've got to do whatever we can,
so that no innocent girls are murdered.

158
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:03,212
Would you like a glass
of water, Mrs. Franklin?

159
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,333
Yes...

160
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,759
Mr. Franklin, tell me about your daughter.

161
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,013
Who were her friends?

162
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:20,016
Did she ever date anyone besides Tony?

163
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,769
Marcy wasn't much of a gadabout.

164
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,939
She went steady with Tony...

165
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,651
For over a year.

166
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:35,489
She had lots of friends,
everyone liked her.

167
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,784
No one would do this to my Marcy!

168
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,330
No one who knew her!

169
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:52,840
Did you daughter belong to any
organizations, clubs, anything like that?

170
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,303
No, she had lots of friends.

171
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,058
She didn't belong to
any one particular group.

172
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,020
She did have her name on a book club list.

173
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:09,732
Book club list? When?
What do you mean, "book club list"?

174
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,943
She was going to graduate from high school
this June.

175
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:16,030
I made her a dress, a white dress.

176
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:19,450
And now she'll never wear it,
she'll never wear it!

177
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,118
Please, Molly, please!

178
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,871
I've give you a list of her friends' names.

179
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,875
We'll do anything. Anything
at all to help you find this killer.

180
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,419
Easy, Molly, take it easy.

181
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,601
Oh, it's nearly ready.

182
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,312
Nearly ready.

183
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:54,443
The ancient formula
needed for your rebirth.

184
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,250
Now, we shall have the flavor.

185
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,293
The special flavor...

186
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:17,466
Seasoned just right for you,
oh, mother of the veiled darkness.

187
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,149
No! No! No!

188
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,946
No...

189
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:26,799
Oh, Suzette dear!

190
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:30,219
Well, things are finally underway
for your party.

191
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,890
The caterer has a marvelous idea,
I can hardly wait. Aren't you excited?

192
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,935
Yes, Mother! Of course I am!

193
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,606
Only, I was reading about all those murders

194
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,901
and it sort of takes all the joy
out of everything.

195
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,405
It's all so strange.

196
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,742
I mean, the police not finding any clues
or anything.

197
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,370
It's terrible!

198
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:01,125
I just shudder when I think
about that butcher...

199
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:04,086
That maniac, butchering all those girls.

200
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:08,382
I wish they could find out who did it
and put him where he belongs.

201
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,635
I won't feel safe until they do.

202
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:14,972
Oh, it is horrible, but,
Suzette don't be silly.

203
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,182
I'm sure the police
will find him real soon.

204
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:22,438
Anyway, the dinner party Saturday will take
our minds off all this horrible killing.

205
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,232
Suzette, it will be a wonderful surprise!

206
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:29,361
I'm sure it will be, Mother,
and I can hardly wait!

207
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:31,947
Well, I better get going.

208
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,242
Tonight is the weekly lecture
on ancient history.

209
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:39,079
We're learning about cults
of the Egyptian gods.

210
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,540
Did you say Egyptian gods?

211
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:45,961
- Well, that's a coincidence.
- What kind of a coincidence, Mother?

212
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:50,049
Oh, well, there's that nicest
little man, he... Oh, well...

213
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,760
Call me when you're ready to come home.

214
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:57,222
I don't want you out on the streets at night.
Not with all this terrible killing going on.

215
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:01,101
Yes, I will, Mother. Bye, see you later.

216
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:23,207
Hello? Helen? Dorothy Fremont.

217
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:27,878
You are coming to Suzette's party?
Oh, wonderful!

218
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,672
I have a fantastic treat planned.

219
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:35,844
Oh, well, I found a perfectly delightful
caterer who has a marvelous idea.

220
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:39,014
Who? His name is Fuad Ramses.

221
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:42,810
Ramses I
and Ramses II were pharaohs.

222
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:45,729
It was Ramses ll

223
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:50,234
whose soldiers were drowned in the Red Sea
while chasing Moses and the Israelites.

224
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:56,073
Now, our mutual interest
in the cults of Ancient Egypt,

225
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:59,034
takes us tonight to the cult of Ishtar,

226
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:03,997
a goddess who was worshipped
by the early Egyptian and Assyrian peoples

227
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,583
more than 5,000 years ago.

228
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,377
The worship of Ishtar

229
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,131
or the 'mother of the veiled darkness'
as she was sometimes called,

230
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:15,634
was one of the most bloodthirsty religions
ever known.

231
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:20,722
Though she was worshipped as the goddess
of love and beauty

232
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:25,018
such as Venus or Aphrodite
of the Greek and Roman civilizations,

233
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:29,773
hers was an evil love
that thrived on violence.

234
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:35,195
And the festival of Ishtar was celebrated
at the beginning of spring

235
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:40,075
when life again was given to the land
from the swollen body of the Nile River.

236
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:46,832
The temple of Ishtar stood high on a hill
overlooking the city of Antioch.

237
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,752
The goddess was served by 20 beautiful,
young virgin girls.

238
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:55,299
Shamash was Ishtar’s high priest and lover.

239
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:59,887
He was worshipped as a lesser god,
by the men of the city.

240
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:03,015
On the eve of the feast of Ishtar,

241
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,101
the people of the city crowded
around the temple.

242
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,770
Here, for six wild days and nights,

243
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:12,441
the young priestesses would mingle
with the men of the city

244
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,485
and lust would reign over the land.

245
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:20,574
On the seventh day, the crowd would gather
at the temple for the great feast,

246
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:24,703
a blood feast that would give the goddess
to the people.

247
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:28,749
The young priestesses would be slaughtered
on the great altar.

248
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:33,462
Their blood would be caught in silver bowls
as it ran from their bodies.

249
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:37,341
Then certain organs and limbs
would be removed,

250
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:40,219
and prepared as dishes to serve the people.

251
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:44,514
As the last morsel
of this horrible feast was eaten,

252
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:49,102
the high priestess would show herself
rising from the tomb.

253
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,314
A living incarnation of Ishtar.

254
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:56,318
Ishtar arisen in flesh and blood,

255
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,654
and become part of the people.

256
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:47,327
This custom of the blood feast existed
for more than 400 years

257
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:53,208
and was finally abolished by Amenhotep ll,
of the 15th dynasty.

258
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:56,253
It is said that even today,

259
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:59,673
there are still followers
of this gruesome goddess.

260
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:02,426
However, it has never been proven.

261
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:06,388
And this concludes my lecture
on Ancient Egyptian cult.

262
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,224
I hope to see you all again here next week.

263
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:15,689
Thank you, sir.

264
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:21,403
- Thank you. I'm very glad you enjoyed.
- Oh, I certainly did.

265
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,126
- We like you very much.
- Thank you, sir.

266
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,075
Thank you. Appreciate it.

267
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,414
Thank you.

268
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,750
- Goodbye.
- Thank you, sir.

269
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:43,342
Oh, how could a race of people
actually follow such a vile cult?

270
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,303
Well, the ancients
had many strange cults, honey.

271
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,723
You know, an idea based on blood lust,

272
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:53,393
well, that could spread quickly
in a civilization founded on superstition.

273
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:59,441
Yes, I can see what you mean.
But to actually eat human flesh...

274
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,651
Pete, how could they?

275
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:04,946
Oh, come on, honey, let's talk
about something more pleasant.

276
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,740
Like, for example, you and me?

277
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:09,326
You're coming to my party Saturday night,
aren't you?

278
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,496
I'm counting on your being my date.

279
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,831
I wouldn't miss it.

280
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:18,460
Say, I understand, your mother went all out
on this one, even for her.

281
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:22,089
But I will try and make it
if I'm not tied up on a case.

282
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,966
You know,
with all these grisly murders going on,

283
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,219
I'm on 24-hour call.

284
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:30,389
Pete, what do you make
of all these murders?

285
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:31,973
Isn't there any clue at all?

286
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,643
No, not so far.

287
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:38,230
You know we have every man on the force
working double duty?

288
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:41,858
But nothing's broken so far.

289
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:44,319
Although, young... Young Tony Parker?

290
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:46,488
The boy who was with the girl killed
on the beach.

291
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,698
Now, he did give us one clue.

292
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,784
He said that though everything
happened so quickly,

293
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:55,288
he got a glimpse of gray hair
and strange glowing eyes.

294
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,959
And it seems to be an older man
that we're looking for.

295
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:02,546
I kinda got one clue on my own, it's, er...

296
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:06,675
I can't seem to make it fit, though.
It's about a book...

297
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,929
But I can't...
I can't make out the significance of it.

298
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,682
I feel safer with you working on it, Pete.

299
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,644
And now I'd better call Mother
for a ride home.

300
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:21,857
- She gets frantic when I'm out late at night.
- Say, how about me giving you a lift?

301
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:25,068
You know the mad killer wouldn't bother you
being with a policeman.

302
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:29,448
- And, don't worry, it's not a police car.
- I'm not hinting, that would be great.

303
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:32,242
- Just let me call Mother first.
- Okay.

304
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,434
Let's stop for a minute
honey, huh?

305
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:02,564
I... I don't know. Do you think it's safe?

306
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,984
You know on second thought

307
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,862
you might be safer with the killer
than you are with me?

308
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:13,825
Pete! Don't make a joke of it.
You know I'm not afraid of you.

309
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:17,996
And it is such a lovely night.

310
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,084
- Why not? But just for a little while.
- Okay.

311
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:29,758
You know...

312
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,970
This is the first pleasant evening
I've had since that first murder.

313
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:38,934
I'm just gonna sit back, relax.

314
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,686
Say...

315
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,774
Do you know now that I've got you all
to myself all alone,

316
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:50,278
I don't know what to do with you,
but I got an idea or two.

317
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,657
Easy, Mr. Officer.

318
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:58,453
You're supposed to keep law and order,
not break it.

319
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,415
Even though you are pretty nice.

320
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,961
You know something,
you're pretty nice yourself.

321
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:09,047
Say, Suzette, er...

322
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,926
Well, ever since we started
these Egyptian culture classes,

323
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:16,638
well, I've wanted to say something to you.

324
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,848
You have, Pete? What is it?

325
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:23,103
Well...

326
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:27,649
I don't know. I guess I'm a better
policeman than I am a public speaker.

327
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,571
Then don't speak, Pete.

328
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:46,668
<i><i>We interrupt this program
to bring you a news bulletin.</i></i>

329
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,421
<i>Another victim of the recent wave
of brutal attacks</i>

330
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,256
<i>has been found near-death.</i>

331
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:57,846
<i>Police say the victim is a young girl, about
23. Identity has not yet been established.</i>

332
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,849
<i>The girl's condition
is described as critical.</i>

333
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,578
I better get going, honey,
they might need me down at the station.

334
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,353
Oh, Pete!

335
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,242
Well that's it. The whole story.

336
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:23,580
Found this girl on a deserted street
on the outskirts of town.

337
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:26,916
She was just about gone
but we did get her to a hospital.

338
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,211
The whole side of her face was hacked away.

339
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,297
Pete, if she can identify her attacker,

340
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,633
this just might be the break
we've been waiting for.

341
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,177
Well, then let's get over there, pronto.

342
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:49,564
Thank you, nurse, that will be all.
Doctor, we've done all we can.

343
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:50,899
Thank you.

344
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:55,487
You... Can only stay a few minutes,
there's isn't much time.

345
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,365
Doctor, is there any chance at all?

346
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,408
Not a chance.

347
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,162
This is one of the most brutal cases
I've ever seen.

348
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:08,917
Her face was hacked away, clear to
the bone, her eyes were gouged out.

349
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,255
She's lost a great deal of blood
and she's in severe shock.

350
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:21,554
- It's a terrible thing. Such a young girl, too.
- Has anyone notified her folks?

351
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,557
So far, we don't know who she is.

352
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:28,269
There was no identification on her
when the police brought her in.

353
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,273
Your missing person counter is checking.

354
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,776
I'll let you know when we get a report.

355
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,569
Can we talk to her?

356
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,118
You can try,
but please make it short.

357
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,329
Miss? Can you hear me, miss?

358
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:53,044
Can you hear me? We're police officers.

359
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,587
We need your help.

360
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:57,382
Yes...

361
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,593
I can hear you.

362
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:02,804
What's your name?

363
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:07,392
Janet

364
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:12,355
Janet... Blake.

365
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:17,652
Who did this to you, Janet?
What did the person look like?

366
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,156
Wild eyes!

367
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,659
He had...

368
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:26,703
wild eyes!

369
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:31,374
I was walking...

370
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,544
He came from...

371
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,755
behind a bush.

372
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:40,175
Horrible old man!

373
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:44,220
He said it was for

374
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:46,347
"Itar."

375
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,184
"Itar."

376
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:50,727
Doctor!

377
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,996
I'm afraid it's all over.

378
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:21,382
She never had a chance, poor kid.

379
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,887
An old man with wild eyes.

380
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:28,932
Well, at least it's something.

381
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,559
What do you make of it, Pete?

382
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:34,437
What do you think she meant by "Itar"?

383
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,272
I don't know.

384
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:39,692
Could be somebody's name.

385
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,404
Strange, though...

386
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,907
It almost sounds familiar.

387
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:53,915
Well, the killer must've thought she
was dead. It's a miracle she wasn't.

388
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,418
Well, she is now.

389
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,921
Yeah.

390
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:04,259
Well, okay, let's go make a report,

391
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,928
and every man over 40
with any kind of a record

392
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:10,139
gets picked up for questioning.
We might come up with something.

393
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,060
I pray to God we do.

394
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:01,834
I would like to speak
to Miss Trudy Sanders, please.

395
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:08,299
Oh, I see. Er, this is quite urgent.

396
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:12,053
Er, could you tell me
where she could be reached?

397
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:19,727
Oh, the Fremont residence.
Er, yes, I have the number.

398
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,814
Yes, thank you very much.

399
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,699
Oh, Ishtar,

400
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,617
mother of the black sun.

401
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:38,663
Tomorrow, you shall have life.

402
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,084
For I, Ramses...

403
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,337
shall give you life.

404
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:50,800
Only one more thing do I need

405
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:54,929
and the formula will be complete.

406
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:28,231
Gee, I sure am excited
about the party tomorrow night.

407
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:31,067
I wonder what Mother has planned.

408
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:35,530
I don't know, but your mum certainly asked
that this year's party be a real treat.

409
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:41,410
I can hardly wait for this party to start.
Sounds like a real blast.

410
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:45,623
It's getting late, I better leave.

411
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:48,417
I wanna finish shopping
before it gets too dark.

412
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:52,588
It gives me the shivers when I think
of that killer loose somewhere.

413
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:54,715
I'm gonna get dressed.

414
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:59,887
Gee, Suzette, do you what type
of party your mother has planned?

415
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:04,100
Well, I'm not sure but
I think I have an idea.

416
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:07,395
I'm not supposed to know anything about it.

417
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,439
I think it's gonna be an Egyptian feast.

418
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:13,025
- Egyptian feast?
- Yes!?

419
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:17,238
Well, you know, Mum knows how interested
I've been in Egyptian culture

420
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,407
and how I've been going
to lectures every week.

421
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,242
Doesn't that sound exciting?

422
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:22,011
That's right. Trudy Sanders.
She's been missing since last night.

423
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:23,971
Now look, I want an all-city alarm,

424
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:26,307
and I want to know
the moment you hear anything.

425
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,977
- I can only hope it's not the killer.
- Yeah.

426
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,105
You know Trudy is a good friend
of Suzette Fremont's.

427
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,858
She said she left her house
about 7:30 last night.

428
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:40,404
- And she never got home, did she?
- Yes, it looks bad,

429
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,532
but we're doing everything
we can to find her.

430
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,452
Look, I'm going down and checking
on the suspects

431
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,454
that the boys brought in this morning.

432
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:50,831
- Keep me posted, Pete.
- Will do.

433
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,983
Hello, I'd like to speak
to Suzette, please.

434
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,025
Sure.

435
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:22,280
Hello, Suzette, Pete Thornton.

436
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,824
Yeah, I know, that's why I called.

437
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,575
You know we've been so busy around here

438
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:28,911
that I completely forgot
about the dinner party.

439
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:31,195
You know I'll have to be late, honey,
if you don't mind.

440
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,541
Yeah.

441
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:38,212
No, honey, I'm sorry we haven't
had any word on Trudy as yet.

442
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,718
Yeah, I know you are, but... Well...
Try and enjoy yourself anyway.

443
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,388
Say, just what was the big surprise?

444
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:52,935
Hey, that sounds great.
Real Egyptian-style stuff, huh?

445
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,939
Who? Fuad Ramses?

446
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:58,441
No, never heard of him.

447
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,861
Oh, just like Dr. Flanders' speech, huh?

448
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:04,739
Ishtar?

449
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:08,951
Well, I hope it isn't exactly
like Flanders described it.

450
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:12,663
But it does sound like fun and I'll get
there as soon as I can, honey, okay?

451
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,291
Goodbye, then.

452
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,961
Ishtar.

453
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:59,960
And now, now for the flavors.

454
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:04,965
The flavor of blood of a young goddess.

455
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:08,552
Give blood...

456
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:10,888
to give life to Ishtar.

457
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,771
No!

458
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:26,404
Stop your screaming!
Stop your screaming, Trudy!

459
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,490
Give yourself up to the goddess!

460
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,158
Give yourself up!

461
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:41,419
Give yourself up to the goddess!
Give yourself up.

462
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:39,894
Ishtar...

463
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:42,480
Itar?

464
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:46,233
Ishtar. Itar...

465
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:01,207
Dr. Flanders, this is
Pete Thornton, homicide.

466
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:05,419
Yes, sir, er, I have a few questions
I'd like you to help me with, sir.

467
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:08,088
Now you gave a talk last week

468
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:11,008
on the blood feast of Ishtar,
the Egyptian goddess?

469
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,428
Yes, sir, the festival.

470
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:17,097
Well, could you tell me
a little bit more about it?

471
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:27,107
Er, yes, Dr. Flanders,
you've been very helpful, thank you.

472
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:29,777
And I have just one more question, sir.

473
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:33,739
Have you ever heard of a man
called Fuad Ramses?

474
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:35,783
He runs a catering service.

475
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:38,452
Oh.

476
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:42,039
Ancient Weird Religious Rites, huh?

477
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:44,250
Yeah...

478
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:47,628
We found a copy of that at the...

479
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:51,131
No, never mind, sir.
Thank you, Doctor, thank you very much.

480
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,806
Yeah, Lieutenant Thornton.
Listen, alert all cars,

481
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:03,936
send them to the vicinity of 45th and
Lincoln, place called Ramses' Catering.

482
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:07,690
And listen, get Mason over here fast.
I think we got our killer.

483
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:28,812
- What is it, Pete?
- Listen, Frank, I got a hunch

484
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:32,274
and if it proves right, I hope you've
got a strong stomach. Come on.

485
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,205
Come on, Frank, maybe in the back.

486
00:52:56,465 --> 00:53:00,552
What in the name of all that's holy
is that?

487
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:05,933
That's Ishtar, Frank,
the goddess of love.

488
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,687
Find the light, Frank.

489
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:27,121
If I'm not mistaken, Frank,
that's Trudy Sanders.

490
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:12,750
Frank...

491
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:17,171
If I'm right, these are the leftovers

492
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,674
from the preparation
for the feast of Ishtar.

493
00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:23,010
That's a blood feast.

494
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,888
They take all their young girls...

495
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:32,644
- And they cook 'em to satisfy their gods.
- Oh, no...

496
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:40,360
Holy smoke, Frank!
We gotta get over to the Fremont house!

497
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:44,990
They're having a dinner party tonight,
and Fuad Ramses is the caterer.

498
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:48,327
Fuad Ramses? Well, let's get going.

499
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:51,497
Roberts, Nicholson,
Harris, get on that phone,

500
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:55,542
call the Fremonts. For Pete's
sake, tell them not to eat anything.

501
00:54:56,627 --> 00:55:00,047
Oh, and try not to make Ramses
suspicious until we get there.

502
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:17,731
Operator?

503
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:19,066
Good evening.

504
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:36,124
Come on, Nancy,
Mr. Ramses is about to serve.

505
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:41,463
It's my boyfriend calling long-distance.
I had him, now we're out off.

506
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,131
I have to wait.

507
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:46,593
Oh, here's our Mr. Ramses now.

508
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:50,055
Oh, Mrs. Fremont, a joyous occasion.

509
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:53,684
And now, I must alert your guests.

510
00:55:57,563 --> 00:56:01,024
The feast of Ishtar is about to begin.

511
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,611
But...

512
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:09,074
To make the feast more authentic,

513
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,619
I must ask the co-operation

514
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:17,457
of the young lady in whose honor
the feast is given.

515
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:20,210
- Who me?
- How exciting!

516
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,964
Yes, Mrs. Fremont, it is exciting.

517
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,676
And now, if the young lady will

518
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,971
accompany me into the kitchen

519
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:35,392
we will prepare the feast. If you please?

520
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:41,565
- Oh, I'll bet there never was a party like this.
- Ah, but there was, Mrs. Fremont...

521
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,527
5,000 years ago.

522
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:48,488
Ooh, 5,000 years ago!

523
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,000
Bill!

524
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:04,421
Bill? Bill? Are you there?

525
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,426
Where is all the food?

526
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:13,347
Er, it's in the garage, my dear.

527
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:16,266
You see, it would be a desecration

528
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:19,311
to bring it into the house
before you bless it.

529
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:21,855
Come.

530
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:24,942
And now, my dear,

531
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:28,654
I would like you be kind
to the whim of an old man.

532
00:57:29,905 --> 00:57:32,532
As you can see, my dear,
I am an old man.

533
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:36,203
And I shall never again
have a chance to

534
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:38,830
offer a feast to Ishtar.

535
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:42,250
You see, in the ancient days,

536
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:45,712
it required a young maiden like yourself

537
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:48,882
to be offered to bless the feast.

538
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,927
How do I do that?

539
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:56,098
Well, it is necessary, my dear, to, uh...

540
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:59,059
To lie outstretched on an altar.

541
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:03,063
Uh, I have prepared this table.
This table will do.

542
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:07,651
Allow me to help you, and then you...
you lie back

543
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:13,073
with your head here.

544
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:17,494
And now, my dear,
you must raise your arms

545
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:19,246
to the heavens

546
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:23,750
and you say, "Oh, Ishtar.

547
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:25,919
"Take me unto yourself."

548
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:30,674
And your eyes must be tightly closed.

549
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:33,343
Is that all?

550
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:36,471
Yes, my dear, that is all.

551
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:40,517
And you will make
the heart of an old man glad.

552
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:44,521
Like this?

553
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,023
This is fun.

554
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:49,651
Dr. Flanders said something in his lecture.

555
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:56,491
Hey! You wouldn't sacrifice me
on this altar, would you?

556
00:58:58,076 --> 00:59:01,079
Of course not, my dear,
of course not.

557
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:02,247
Lie down.

558
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:15,218
And now, my dear,
you must repeat the sacred words.

559
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:19,264
Oh, I've forgotten them.

560
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:22,142
I will repeat them for you.

561
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,811
First you must close your eyes.

562
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:27,314
Then you say,

563
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,525
"Oh, Ishtar,

564
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:33,320
"take me unto yourself."

565
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:35,864
And your...

566
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:39,326
Eyes must be tightly closed.

567
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:45,040
Oh, my Ishtar...

568
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:48,335
This is silly.

569
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:52,964
Oh, my dear. Please, do not
break the heart of an old man.

570
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:54,925
Your guests are waiting.

571
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:58,678
Oh, I... I'm sorry. I'll do it.

572
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:03,350
Oh, my Ishtar...

573
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,728
Your eyes must be tightly closed,

574
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:09,689
so that the image of Ishtar is before you.

575
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:14,653
Oh, my Ishtar,

576
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:18,782
take me unto yourself.

577
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,743
Now, oh, Ishtar,

578
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:24,621
the feast has begun.

579
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:32,391
Oh, Mr. Ramses,
I must say the guests are getting...

580
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:17,257
Suzette? Suzette! Suzette!
Mrs. Fremont! Are you okay, honey?

581
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,593
Oh, come here. Come here.

582
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:24,222
Oh, Petey.

583
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,516
If it... If it weren't
for Mother coming in...

584
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,935
What's this all... What's this all about?

585
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:31,479
Ramses is the killer
we've been looking for.

586
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:37,068
Mrs. Fremont, I'm afraid this
feast is evidence of murder.

587
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:39,070
Oh, dear.

588
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:41,948
The guests will have to eat hamburgers
for dinner tonight.

589
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:44,659
Did your
men catch him as he ran out?

590
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:47,329
No, but we will.

591
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:49,956
We have to.

592
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:54,794
Suzette, look honey.

593
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:56,755
I'm afraid I got some
very bad news for you.

594
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:58,131
Now, listen.

595
01:01:58,215 --> 01:01:59,966
We found Trudy.

596
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,802
And I'm afraid she was
another victim of Ramses.

597
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,515
Oh, Pete!

598
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:10,477
Oh, how horrible!

599
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:14,064
Oh, I pray that they catch him
before it's too late.

600
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:17,275
Oh, poor Trudy!

601
01:02:17,317 --> 01:02:20,195
Oh, poor Trudy!

602
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:26,493
Try and get some rest. Huh?

603
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:29,037
Lay down and get some rest, honey,
and then when I get back

604
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,665
we'll have other things to talk
about, okay, honey?

605
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,251
Okay, Pete, let's go get him!

606
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:35,752
Please, hon.

607
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:23,193
Frank, stop the truck!

608
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:39,292
Stop!

609
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:43,922
Hey, what's happened?
You guys run into trouble?

610
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:55,475
What happened?

611
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:57,644
You don't know it, buddy,

612
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:01,981
but you just did this town
the biggest service it's ever had.

613
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:06,736
Sergeant, notify headquarters
that the killer

614
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:09,197
is no more.

615
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:12,784
He died a fitting death,

616
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,661
like the garbage he was.

617
01:05:16,496 --> 01:05:18,706
Pete, how in the world
did you figure this out anyway?

618
01:05:19,961 --> 01:05:21,628
Well, Frank,

619
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:24,045
I kept remembering the name 'ltar'.

620
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:26,756
You know the name that girl gave us
before she died?

621
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:29,300
Well, Suzette Fremont told me
that her mother

622
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:32,178
had planned a real Egyptian feast
as a surprise for her.

623
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:35,223
And you know what a bug
I am on Egyptian culture.

624
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:37,350
Dr. Flanders gave a talk

625
01:05:37,392 --> 01:05:40,019
on the ancient Egyptian goddess
Ishtar last week.

626
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:45,066
The names 'ltar' and 'Ishtar'
were so similar that I got a hunch.

627
01:05:45,525 --> 01:05:48,862
And then Suzette told me that a Fuad Ramses

628
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,613
was catering the affair.

629
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:52,699
So I called Dr. Flanders

630
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:55,452
and asked him more
about the blood festival of Ishtar.

631
01:05:55,994 --> 01:05:58,371
He said he knew of Fuad Ramses
who had

632
01:05:58,413 --> 01:06:01,499
written a book called the
Ancient Weird Religious Rites.

633
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:03,418
And then I remembered,

634
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:06,713
the book we found next to the body
of the girl who was killed in the bathtub,

635
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:08,423
it's the same book.

636
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:12,010
Obviously this man kept a list
of the people who wrote for this book.

637
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:14,929
So, Frank?

638
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:19,684
Who knows if the spell
of this monstrous goddess

639
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,478
has possessed anyone else?

640
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:24,689
Lust, murder,

641
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:27,692
food for an ancient goddess
who received life

642
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:29,694
through the perverted
death of others.

643
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:36,284
Let's go home, Frank.
