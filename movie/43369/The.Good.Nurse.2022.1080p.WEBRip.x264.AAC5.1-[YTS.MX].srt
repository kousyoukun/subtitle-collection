3
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:08,125
Can I get some help in here?

4
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:10,333
<i>Code Blue, section 12.</i>

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,875
<i>Code Blue…</i>

6
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:15,625
I need some help, please!

7
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:18,083
What's going on?

8
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:21,208
Came in, he was seizing,
then he started coding.

9
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:24,166
-I'll get the bag.
-What's going on, Charlie?

10
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,500
I came in, he was seizing,
he went into V-tach, and then he coded.

11
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,791
-Let's swap compressions.
-Okay.

12
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:32,166
In three, two, one…

13
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,416
-Good swap.
-<i>Section 12…</i>

14
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,125
Breath, two, three, four…

15
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:38,208
Okay, what's going on in here?

16
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:41,458
I heard the alarm from the hall.
I came in and saw he was seizing,

17
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,500
silenced the vent,
noticed he was in V-tach,

18
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:44,750
and then he went asystolic.

19
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:46,625
-Compressions.
-Watch out.

20
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:49,375
No epi yet.
He's about a minute into compressions.

21
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,791
Okay. Let's get the epi started, please,

22
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,708
and let's pause in a minute
for a pulse check.

23
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:54,666
Copy that.

24
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,291
Breath.

25
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:58,000
Quick compressions.

26
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,666
-12, 13, 14, 15.
-Breath.

27
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,458
-Breath, two.
-Two, three.

28
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,916
-Breath.
-Six, seven, eight, nine, ten…

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,208
Let's pause for a pulse check.

30
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,250
14, 15. No pulse.

31
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,375
-Is that a shockable rhythm?
-Yeah, it's shockable.

32
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,958
-Uh, let's charge 150 joules.
-Charging.

33
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:18,041
-Breath.
-Ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

34
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:20,208
-Quick compressions.
-Come on.

35
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,125
Five, six…

36
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,041
-Keeping compressions.

37
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,916
-Clear for the shock.
-You all clear?

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,208
-Clear.

39
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:29,083
Back on the chest.
Let's get another round of epi, please.

40
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,958
-A little deeper with our compressions.
-Breath.

41
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,250
Breath. Hold.

42
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,250
-Keep your compressions.
-Talk to me.

43
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,583
-Good compressions.
-Breath, two, three, four.

44
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,416
-Breath.
-13, 14, 15.

45
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,708
-Breath.
-Can I get an epi standing by?

46
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,791
Four, five, six, seven…

47
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,291
-And charge.
-Ten, 11, 12, 13.

48
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:53,166
-All right, let's pull back.
-All clear. All is clear.

49
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,458
-All clear.

50
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,333
-Back on.

51
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,458
-Three, two, one…
-Breath.

52
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,791
-Breath.
-Faster compressions, please.

53
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:03,791
Breath.

54
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,041
14, 15…

55
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,291
200 joules. Let's hit him.

56
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,000
Breath.

57
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,375
-Breath.

58
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,416
-Hit him again.

59
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,291
Back on.

60
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,083
Breath.

61
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,250
-I'm not getting anything.
-Breath.

62
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:24,000
Ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

63
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,708
-Fuck.
-Three, four, five…

64
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:30,541
-Easing compressions.
-Eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13…

65
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,291
-All right.
-14, 15.

66
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,541
He's had enough.

67
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,291
Mark the time of death.

68
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,666
And let's call his wife.

69
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,125
-Almost there.

70
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,250
Oh.

71
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:58,375
-How long have you two been married?
-Three years.

72
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,666
Wow. Couple o' newlyweds.

73
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,208
You know, baby, I love you so much.

74
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,291
All right. I have got it.

75
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,791
-All right.
-Oh.

76
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,291
Can we get her some water, please?

77
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:21,250
Sorry, she can't have any until tomorrow.
She still might choke.

78
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,583
But here.

79
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,458
This is gonna make her feel better.

80
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:32,291
-I have to go, but I'll be back.
-No. No, you can't go.

81
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:35,333
You know the rules.
I'm not allowed to stay.

82
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:38,291
Hey, Sam, this chair reclines.

83
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,541
You want a blanket and pillow?

84
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,125
Yeah. Thanks. Yeah.

85
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,833
Okay. I won't tell if you don't.

86
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,750
-I'll be right back.
-Thanks.

87
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,333
You've pushed a liter.
I don't understand why his pressure's low.

88
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,041
They don't know, but they want
another set of labs at midnight.

89
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay, what about Holly?

90
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,375
Holly is stable,
but they still need to get--

91
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,416
Amy.

92
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,250
I'd like to have a word with you
about 310.

93
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:05,666
Jeez.

94
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,125
You let a relative sleep over?

95
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,041
An old man, yeah.
He was exhausted, and it was 1:00 a.m.

96
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,125
We don't have the staff
to run a hotel for relatives.

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,708
Management has got me
rationing coffee filters.

98
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,166
Every penny is like a freaking prisoner.

99
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,500
I had to beg Linda Garran for extra staff.

100
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,000
Right.

101
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,750
But I got nights some help, okay?

102
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:41,375
A new guy, tons of experience,
great recommendations.

103
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,375
-Oh.

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,916
Great.

105
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,291
-You're welcome.

106
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,750
-It's Viv.

107
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,833
Hey, Holly, it's Amy.

108
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,583
All right,
I'm just gonna turn you a little bit.

109
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,458
Just put this arm down.

110
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:05,916
Hey, I ran into your sister
when I started my shift.

111
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,000
She's so nice. Did you guys
have a good time together?

112
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,250
I can't believe she's got twins.

113
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,333
I don't know how…

114
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,375
she does that.

115
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,708
Okay.

116
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:29,208
One, two, three.

117
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,375
Okay, one…

118
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,333
Ah…

119
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,541
How was the fried chicken?
Did you do the paper bag shake?

120
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:53,625
Yeah, I did the whole thing.
Whatever Julia Child said, I did.

121
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,083
-Amazing.
-Um…

122
00:08:56,791 --> 00:09:00,916
Uh, I think… you still owe me
for last Friday.

123
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,750
But… But it can wait, really.

124
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,333
Oh no! I'm sorry.

125
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,375
No, really, it's okay.

126
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,875
I'm such an idiot.

127
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,333
-Okay, 20, 40…
-Listen, you really don't have to do this.

128
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,958
-I don't need it all.
-Six, seven… No, no, no. Eight, nine…

129
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,625
Come on. Here, take it.
There's 50. Sorry about that.

130
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,666
-Thank you. I'm sorry too.
-It's yours.

131
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,000
Come on, Mr. Teddy.
We're going to school!

132
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:26,625
I think we talked about Mr. Teddy
not going to school before.

133
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,875
-Thanks, Mom.
-Come here, Mr. Bag.

134
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:30,958
I'm ready.

135
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,833
-Bye.
-Have the best day.

136
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,083
-Bye!
-Love you!

137
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:42,125
-You need some milk, by the way.
-Okay. I'll get it.

138
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,041
-See you later.
-Thanks.

139
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,791
Off to class, girls.

140
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,166
Hmm.

141
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,541
So it's not the news
we were hoping for.

142
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:19,583
Hmm.

143
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:21,875
How bad we talkin'?

144
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,333
If you continue like this,

145
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,791
you're looking at a serious
coronary incident within months,

146
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,041
which could be fatal.

147
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,333
At the last appointment,
you said that there were options.

148
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,916
I know, but that was
before we got these results.

149
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,083
This is now about
keeping your heart going long enough.

150
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:43,916
For what?

151
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,375
To get you on the transplant list.

152
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:54,291
And you'll have to stop working,
take medical leave.

153
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,583
I can't. I need health insurance,

154
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:01,125
and I don't get paid leave
until I've been there a year.

155
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:05,791
You have kids, right?

156
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:07,791
Mm-hmm.

157
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,000
Well, you're at high risk for a stroke.

158
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,083
You should make them aware
of the symptoms.

159
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:19,333
The early warning signs of an episode
are breathlessness, pressure in the chest,

160
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,625
feeling weak or faint.

161
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:24,833
You need to tell them in case
something should happen at home. Okay?

162
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,208
-Hi. Loughren.
-Mm-hmm.

163
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,541
I'm checking out.

164
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,375
Sure.

165
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,041
-So I see you're not covered?
-Nope.

166
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:42,083
With the test
and consultation, it'll be $980.

167
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,208
Um…

168
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,625
Can I split it in two?

169
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:52,625
Sure thing.

170
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:32,083
<i>Maria, can you turn me up? Watch TV.</i>

171
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,291
<i>…vitamin D. Thank you.</i>

172
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,250
-Hey.
Oh.

173
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,583
-You the new guy?
Ah, yeah, Charlie.

174
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:55,916
Hi, Charlie. Amy.

175
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,458
-Oh, hey, Amy.
-Nice to meet you.

176
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,791
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

177
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:05,208
-Did anyone give you the tour yet?
-Uh, no, not yet.

178
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:08,458
-I got my patients, but, um…
-Okay, come on, let me show you around.

179
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,333
The computer's free for all.

180
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,333
There's a code to access the bathroom,
very importantly,

181
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:16,125
the highly original code 4321.

182
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,416
Uncrackable.

183
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:18,791
Ha!

184
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,250
Uh, you ever work with PYXIS?

185
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,958
Yeah, but I think
we had the '97 model. The, um…

186
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,875
Huh, okay, come on. Let me show you.

187
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,833
Put in your nurse ID.

188
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,500
And then your code.

189
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,125
You put in what you need.

190
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,083
And the amount.

191
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,833
Take it out. One, two, three, four, five.
Close the drawer.

192
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,166
-Got it?
-Yeah.

193
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,708
Uh, they said you had a lot of experience.
Where'd you work at before?

194
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,541
I've been all over, really.

195
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,458
-Florians, Vance, Shawlands, St. Aloysius.
-Shawlands.

196
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,416
A girl I trained with works at Shawlands.

197
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,375
-Oh, yeah?
-Lori.

198
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,500
-Lucas?
-Yes.

199
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:06,583
Yeah, we worked together a lot.
She's great. She's an amazing nurse.

200
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,541
I haven't talked to her forever.

201
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,916
Do they still
call her "Pocket Rocket"?

202
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,750
No. Oh my God. That's hilarious.

203
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,625
I should… I'll call her up
and ask her about that.

204
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,958
Oh God. Please don't.
Don't tell her I told you that.

205
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,375
Who'd they give you tonight?

206
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,500
Uh… Who did they give me?

207
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:30,416
I have 311, uh, Stevens. 310, Martinez.

208
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,875
Do you know their first names? You guys,
you don't put 'em on the doors here.

209
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,000
You're like me.
First names are always better.

210
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,500
-Ana. Let's start with her.
-Ana.

211
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,875
She presented to the ED
with an adverse reaction to amoxicillin.

212
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,958
Kicker is the prescription
was her husband's,

213
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,125
so insurance is gonna try
to screw them over

214
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,375
if we give 'em a chance.

215
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,875
-So how's the skin?
-Sloughing off at this point.

216
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,416
And what, so clears only?

217
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,166
Yeah. First sip tonight.
Come on. I'll introduce you.

218
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,541
Water later.

219
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,333
Well, hey there, lovebirds.

220
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,416
-Look what I brought.
-Hey.

221
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:04,583
Here you go.

222
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,000
Mm!

223
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,958
Is that the best thing
you have ever tasted?

224
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,333
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm?

225
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,791
-There you go.

226
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,541
You know what?
Let's start slow, all right?

227
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,125
-I wanna introduce you to Charlie.
-Hey.

228
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:23,875
He's gonna be your nurse this evening,
but, you know, I'm around if you need me.

229
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,000
Okay?

230
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,541
-So…
-How you doing, Sam? Good?

231
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,666
You let me know when you've had enough.

232
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:32,625
Mm.

233
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,458
-Okay, is it burning? It burns? Okay.
-I'll check in in a bit.

234
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,583
Well, let's take a pause, okay?

235
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:43,416
So, um… tell me, I heard
you had a rough couple of days. Yeah?

236
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,375
Well, you guys just push on the button
if you need anything.

237
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:50,291
Anytime, I'm here.
I'm your Amy for tonight.

238
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,541
-Hey.

239
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,458
Hey.

240
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,958
Uh, so mine are all settled,

241
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,916
so I was just gonna go to the cafeteria,
grab some food.

242
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
-You want something?
-Sorry. Cafeteria closes at 11:00.

243
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:10,416
-I should've told you that.
-Oh shit. No problem. I'm not that hungry.

244
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,250
-Sorry.
-No. I'll hit up the vending machines.

245
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,541
-Hey, you know what? You like eggs?
-Uh…

246
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:21,500
I have a large questionable…
…egg salad that I'd prefer to share.

247
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,875
-You know, safety in numbers.
-I'm fine, thank you.

248
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:27,333
No, no. I'll bring it to the desk
when I'm finished with Holly here.

249
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:28,791
-You sure?
-Yeah.

250
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,083
'Kay, thanks.

251
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:35,958
I like the croutons.

252
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:39,208
-Mm, you mean the soggy crackers?
-That's what they are?

253
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,958
That's the real delicacy of the salad.

254
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,583
Yeah. My eldest daughter made it.

255
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:46,041
She comes from a long line of women
who can't cook.

256
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,583
What, so your husband cooks?

257
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,541
No, it's just me and my girls.

258
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,500
Oh. I have two girls.

259
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,041
Uh… Four and seven.

260
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,000
Mine are five and nine.

261
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,541
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

262
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:05,208
I don't live with mine anymore though.
Their mom moved, like, six hours away, so…

263
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,708
That's kinda why I'm here.

264
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,541
-Well, I think this is great.

265
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,083
-Okay.

266
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,041
-Oh, he's--
307.

267
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:21,541
Yep. Steven. I have about
one minute before he pees.

268
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,750
I got it.

269
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:26,916
You sure? Thanks.

270
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,875
Hey, Steven. I'm Charlie.
I'm afraid Amy's busy right now, so…

271
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,333
Can I help? A little problem?

272
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,208
Yes, you can!

273
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,000
-Look.
-So what? You don't even like her.

274
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:54,250
-I do! She's my friend, Jackie!
-Nobody's gonna notice that.

275
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,833
Everybody's gonna notice!

276
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,875
No, they're not. Come on. Really.

277
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,708
Yes, they are! I don't know
why I have to keep using these.

278
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:01,625
Hey.

279
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:02,791
It's such crap!

280
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,375
-Stop it! What's going on here?
-You ruined my shoes!

281
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,958
I did not! I tried to help you.

282
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:10,166
-Would you mind sitting with Maya?
-No, you obviously didn't, Jackie!

283
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,583
-She's in the--
-That's okay.

284
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,166
Why the hell
are you yelling at Jackie?

285
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,125
-She glued the bottom back on.
-It's not a big deal, Alex.

286
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,041
-I can scrape it off.
-You told her to.

287
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,791
Look, it comes right off.

288
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,291
-But it's on both shoes.
-See? I can take it off.

289
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,833
-I'll just--
-No, you can't.

290
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,916
Calm down. It's not the end of the world.

291
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
No.

292
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,000
-Wait. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Listen. I know.
-Stop--

293
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:34,375
I'm trying, okay? I know you don't have
as much as your friends, but I'm try--

294
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,041
I don't get anything!

295
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,083
-I don't even get to have you.
-I'm sorr…

296
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,375
Oh fuck.

297
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,000
Amy?

298
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,916
What's going on? You okay?

299
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,458
I'm fine.

300
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,208
Okay, well, I'll just sit here
until you feel better, okay?

301
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,125
Now breathe with me.

302
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,291
Keep breathing.

303
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:05,916
It's okay.

304
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,541
Cardiomyopathy.

305
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,375
Blood blisters on… on my heart.

306
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,333
Okay. So why are you working?

307
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,958
I don't have health insurance.

308
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:30,791
What about here?

309
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,625
-Did you speak to a cardiologist?
-No, please.

310
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:34,708
Okay.

311
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,250
Don't tell them.

312
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,041
-I'll get fired.
-Okay.

313
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,875
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

314
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,666
-Okay.
-Yeah.

315
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,791
How much longer do you need to work here
before you get your insurance?

316
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,083
Four months.

317
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:55,916
Okay.

318
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:05,708
I can help you.

319
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,166
Come on.

320
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:17,083
You can do four months.

321
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,625
You're gonna be okay.

322
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:28,125
Yeah?

323
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:32,416
-Are you cold?
-Mm-hmm.

324
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:34,000
Here.

325
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,458
-Something's wrong with the door.
-Oh, it's this.

326
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,291
Ah. Thanks.

327
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:26,583
-It's gonna be a long night.
-Speaking of energy, how was the park?

328
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,458
-She canceled.
-No!

329
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,458
-Yeah. Moved it to next week.
-Oh, that's hard.

330
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:33,458
Called just as I was
about to pick up the girls.

331
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:34,500
Yeah.

332
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,583
Kind of expected it, to be honest.

333
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,000
Uh, one sec.

334
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,166
Hey, what's up? Where's Sonya?

335
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,500
What have we got?

336
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:45,500
She had a family thing,
so I said I'd do her handover.

337
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:48,416
-Uh, 310…
-Yeah.

338
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,458
…expired right at shift change.

339
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:55,375
-Ana?
-Yes. Mrs. Martinez.

340
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:57,583
Don't ask. I don't know what happened.

341
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:00,291
The husband was called. He's on his way.

342
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,791
309, he went sideways at around noon…

343
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:03,958
Ana died.

344
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:07,708
Should be up around eight.
Respiratory came up. They tubed him…

345
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:19,250
How could they just leave her
like this?

346
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:25,625
My mom died in a hospital
when I was a kid.

347
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,750
When I got there to see her, it was…

348
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,791
Well, first of all, they lost the body.

349
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:34,708
-No.
-Yeah. Insane. Just for a couple of hours.

350
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:37,208
But, you know, and then
when they did find her, it was this.

351
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:42,375
She was, like, you know,
half uncovered, naked… Total mess.

352
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:47,083
For the longest time, that was the memory.
That was how I thought of her.

353
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:48,416
Oh, Charlie.

354
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,583
So, for me, this is the important part.

355
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:53,708
Yeah.

356
00:24:55,208 --> 00:24:56,541
Find some dignity.

357
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,250
Mr. Martinez is out there.

358
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:05,416
He would really like
to speak with you, Amy.

359
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,250
Go.

360
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:11,916
-You good?
-Yeah, I got this.

361
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:01,666
22

362
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:53,916
All right,
so give me the story again.

363
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,250
All right, let me see.
Suspicious death of Mrs. Martinez, Ana.

364
00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:03,083
Presented to the emergency room
with adverse reaction to amoxicillin.

365
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:06,833
All right, so?
Reacts to some antibiotic. What else?

366
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,500
They're not sure.

367
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:10,625
-They don't know what killed her?
-No.

368
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:13,375
How old was she?

369
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:14,708
Seventy-seven.

370
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:18,125
Seventy-seven.

371
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:20,250
So why are we here?

372
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:28,958
<i>The conference room's</i>
<i>right this way.</i>

373
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:33,916
Detectives,
Braun, Baldwin, welcome.

374
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,833
I'm Linda Garran, risk manager.

375
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:37,708
This is Duncan Beattie, attorney.

376
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:39,750
Our board.

377
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:43,500
You two might know Malcolm Burrel
from the City Council.

378
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:46,833
I am a huge supporter of the local force
and the district attorney.

379
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:49,125
Ah, well, nice to meet you all.

380
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,125
Okay, well, we don't know much.

381
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,125
Just that there's been a death.

382
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:59,541
An unexplainable incident
in which the patient expired.

383
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,708
Okay. Unexplainable how?

384
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,041
Well, it's the opinion
of the medical experts

385
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:09,083
that this was an unusual
adverse reaction to medications.

386
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:13,750
But we found absolutely nothing
to suggest this was intentional.

387
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:14,708
Then why call us?

388
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:16,666
We didn't think this was a police matter,

389
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,666
but the Department of Health dictates
when we should reach out,

390
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:20,916
and here we are.

391
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,375
What are the medications?

392
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:26,708
Um… Well, all are listed.

393
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:27,750
Thanks.

394
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
It's quite a complicated document.

395
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:37,708
I'll take my chances.

396
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:42,250
Well, if you… if you turn
to the third page,

397
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:46,375
you can see the window in which
patient 1 had abnormal laboratory results

398
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:47,958
and life-threatening symptoms.

399
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:50,250
Where's Mrs. Martinez's body?

400
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:52,208
Uh, released to the family.

401
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:55,125
They put a lawsuit together?

402
00:28:55,916 --> 00:28:58,208
We don't believe that the family are aware

403
00:28:58,291 --> 00:29:01,958
of the unusual circumstances
around patient 1's expiration.

404
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:05,375
Isn't that something
you should've disclosed to them?

405
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:10,041
It was an evolving situation.

406
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,000
Parkfield rightly sought legal counsel

407
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,083
to make sure
everything was done correctly.

408
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:17,333
Okay, but Mrs. Martinez's body is where?
How do we get it?

409
00:29:17,916 --> 00:29:20,750
It's our understanding
the family have cremated her.

410
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:24,166
When did she die?

411
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:26,875
Seven weeks ago.

412
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:31,208
We were conducting
an internal investigation.

413
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:32,875
Hence the lag.

414
00:29:40,791 --> 00:29:42,041
Okay.

415
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:46,750
Well, of course we'll need to interview
all the staff that works in the ICU.

416
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,375
Make way, make way.
I am an important person of the town.

417
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:55,500
In fact, I am <i>the</i> most important person
of the town,

418
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:59,833
if not the most important person
west of the Pecos.

419
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:02,333
"Wherever that is!"

420
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:04,666
I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls.

421
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,958
"So, what do you do?"

422
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:08,833
"Do"? I don't do anything. I'm the mayor.

423
00:30:08,916 --> 00:30:09,958
Okay.

424
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:12,166
"Well, you have to do something now."

425
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,041
"This may be just a one-horse town
without the horse,

426
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:17,125
but it's been invaded by aliens."

427
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:20,333
I'll have to look it up
in my book of <i>How to be Mayor.</i>

428
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:23,500
One. You get to wear a fancy chain.

429
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:27,666
Two. You get driven around in a big car
by your very own chauffeur.

430
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:28,750
Three…

431
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,875
Om nom!

432
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:38,291
You eat. It's…

433
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:45,125
"Three. You eat and drink for fr--"

434
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:48,000
-I'm never gonna get this part!
-Don't get frustrated, honey.

435
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:49,916
Are you kidding? This is great, Alex.

436
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,041
No, and the teacher said that I should
wear a suit and have a mustache.

437
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:58,458
Dress like a man because I'm the mayor.
He said a girl mayor would be weird.

438
00:30:58,541 --> 00:31:00,291
Women can be mayors.

439
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:01,458
I told him that, but--

440
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:05,333
It's a play about an alien invasion,
and the female mayor's the weird part?

441
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:07,166
-Screw that guy.

442
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,750
-I'm here!
-Hey!

443
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:11,250
-Jackie!
-No! You can't go yet.

444
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:14,458
-Oh, sorry, kiddo.
-Come on, sweetheart.

445
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:16,916
-Come here.
-Guess what I brought you.

446
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,541
Okay, take my hands.

447
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:21,250
Repeat after me.

448
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:24,875
I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls.

449
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:26,791
I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls.

450
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:28,875
I am the <i>mayor</i> of Humdrum Falls.

451
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:30,458
I am the <i>mayor</i> of Humdrum Falls.

452
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:33,375
-I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls.
-I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls.

453
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,291
I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls.

454
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:36,291
You got this.

455
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:38,583
Cream and two sugars.

456
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,833
They send over
that internal investigation yet?

457
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:47,375
Oh, not yet. They say they need more time
to compile all the relevant files.

458
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:49,375
Seven weeks wasn't enough of a head start?

459
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:50,583
You'd think.

460
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,833
You want me to

461
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:57,541
go through the staff?

462
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:58,666
Already did.

463
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,500
One of the nurses
had a criminal trespass charge

464
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:03,166
over in Pennsylvania.

465
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:04,958
Oh yeah? A nurse?

466
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:08,208
Yeah, a male nurse.
Charles Cullen. C-U-L-L-E-N.

467
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:09,291
Huh. When?

468
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:11,458
Uh, eight years ago.

469
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:14,250
-What district was it in Pennsylvania?
-Palmer.

470
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:20,416
<i>-Palmer Police Department.</i>
Hello, ma'am.

471
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,083
I'm Detective Braun with Homicide
in the Prosecutor's Office in New Jersey.

472
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:26,916
I need some background
on a guy you picked up there in '95.

473
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,291
Could you pull the case jacket for me?

474
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:32,291
<i>-Do you have a name for me?</i>
-It's Charles Cullen.

475
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:35,875
<i>-Oh, there's a Post-it note on the file.</i>
There's a Post-it note on the file.

476
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:38,500
She's not sure if it's supposed to
be there. Can you spell that?

477
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:39,958
<i>It says "digoxin."</i>

478
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,083
Digoxin? What is that?
A medicine or something?

479
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:48,583
Uh, you got anything else on him?

480
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,083
<i>Picked up for trespassing and…</i>

481
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:53,916
Okay. Picked up for trespassing
and harassment in '95.

482
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,875
Says he slashed a coworker's tires
after they broke up.

483
00:32:56,958 --> 00:32:58,583
<i>The charges were dropped.</i>

484
00:32:58,666 --> 00:33:00,291
-What's that?
<i>-Yep, all charges.</i>

485
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:01,625
Charges were dropped?

486
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:03,583
<i>-Yeah.</i>
-Oh.

487
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:06,125
Okay, thanks so much.

488
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:07,458
<i>-Yep.</i>
-Bye-bye.

489
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:12,958
Something's not right.

490
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,625
Parkfield waited almost two months
to report it.

491
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:18,708
Internal investigation
you don't wanna share.

492
00:33:18,791 --> 00:33:19,875
Expensive lawyers.

493
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,500
Okay.

494
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,500
Well…

495
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:30,041
What possible reason could they have
for covering up a death?

496
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:31,541
Right? What are the motives?

497
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:34,541
It's a business. There's never
a better motivation than money

498
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:36,083
when it comes to that shit, right?

499
00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:48,000
Hello? You can keep eating.

500
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:50,458
We won't take up too much of your time.

501
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:54,916
We just wanna make you aware
of an event the hospital is looking into.

502
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,458
We wanted to assure you all
that the board and I

503
00:33:57,541 --> 00:34:00,750
are dealing with the incident
and everything connected to it.

504
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:03,291
But we thought it best
to bring you all together,

505
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:07,500
make everyone universally aware
that the police are also involved.

506
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:09,083
-And that--
-What is this about?

507
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,458
Uh, there's been an issue
with a patient's death in the ICU.

508
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:18,208
Was the death suspicious?
I mean, if the police are investigating…

509
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:22,000
I wanna be clear. <i>We</i> are investigating
with the assistance of the local police.

510
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:24,208
-Do you know which patient?
-No.

511
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:27,708
But due to the fact
that outside investigation is involved,

512
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:30,208
uh, Mr. Beattie, our attorney, is here,

513
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:32,833
and he would like
to say something as well.

514
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Thanks.

515
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,583
Yes, uh, I just wanna say

516
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:41,250
that I'll be discussing
with each of you individually,

517
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:44,250
but as a blanket statement to all,

518
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,250
I just wanna say that in times like this,

519
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:51,250
patient confidentiality
has to be an absolute priority.

520
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:55,583
Your individual contracts
are very precise when it comes to this.

521
00:34:55,666 --> 00:34:57,416
Anyone speaking to the police

522
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,166
without a representative
of the hospital present

523
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,000
would be in breach of their contract.

524
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:12,833
So at the end of the day,
Mr. Beattie and I are here for you.

525
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:15,125
Uh, we wanna be present
for any interviews,

526
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:17,208
because we have
your best interests at heart.

527
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:20,708
You have full access,
but she's gotta be in the room.

528
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,708
No. Absolutely not. She can't be in there.

529
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:27,208
That lady's the risk manager.
It's her job to be in there.

530
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,458
Who's gonna talk
if their boss is in the interview?

531
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:32,958
We don't even know what happened.
We don't even have a body.

532
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:36,625
The only condition that they asked for
is that she be in the room

533
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:39,000
and that you don't talk specific
about medications.

534
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:42,833
I understand them asking for it,
but why did you give it to them?

535
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:45,166
You're supposed to be the prosecutor.

536
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:48,166
As far as I can see,

537
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,916
they're cooperating fully
with your investigation.

538
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,875
This is all we have. Is this cooperation?

539
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:54,583
They told me about that.

540
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:58,375
They're getting the documents together.
It's done. They're sending it first thing.

541
00:35:59,916 --> 00:36:00,833
Let me ask.

542
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:04,541
Why would Parkfield
conduct an internal investigation,

543
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:06,333
a seven-week internal investigation,

544
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:10,125
then call us in
and put her in the room if it was nothing?

545
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:13,458
Due diligence.

546
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:18,875
I'm shutting it down. She's in the room.

547
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:20,583
Done.

548
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,208
Hi, Amy.

549
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:32,583
Hi.

550
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,416
Nurse Loughren.

551
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,166
-This is Officer Braun, Baldwin.
-How you doin'?

552
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:41,083
-What is this about?
-Just some informal questions.

553
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:44,541
The officers are speaking
to a number of staff in the ICU.

554
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:46,625
Okay.

555
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:54,416
Do you remember Ana Martinez?

556
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:59,000
Yeah, Ana was my patient.

557
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:03,291
Do you recall anything odd
about what happened to her?

558
00:37:04,416 --> 00:37:05,583
Odd?

559
00:37:05,666 --> 00:37:07,166
Well, she died.

560
00:37:07,791 --> 00:37:11,041
Yeah, and it was very sad. It was sudden.

561
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:12,708
Sudden?

562
00:37:12,791 --> 00:37:14,875
Well, patients die in the ICU, but…

563
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:17,625
we didn't expect it.

564
00:37:19,916 --> 00:37:22,916
I don't mean to interrupt.
Can I see you for a minute?

565
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:27,541
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

566
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:31,625
This better be important.
I wanted no interruptions.

567
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:40,625
You see any deviations there?

568
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:48,666
Mm-mm.

569
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:54,375
Wait, yeah. Her glucose.

570
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:55,625
It's, uh…

571
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:59,500
Yeah, the blood sugars, it's wrong.

572
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:02,291
Uh, there's no C-peps.

573
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:04,083
-That's weird.
-What does that mean?

574
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:08,875
Uh, it means that the insulin
in her system wasn't made in her body.

575
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:10,500
Someone gave it to her.

576
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:12,791
So you can tell from that
that she was given insulin?

577
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:17,208
Well, it's not on the list,
and, you know, she's, uh… not diabetic,

578
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:20,166
so the insulin would've been
a double medication error,

579
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,041
which is really rare, so…

580
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:24,083
A double medication error? It's rare?

581
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:25,333
Yeah.

582
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:29,708
-Would that have killed her?
-Sure.

583
00:38:33,916 --> 00:38:34,916
Sorry.

584
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:38,291
-Where were we?

585
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:39,583
Uh, let's see. Oh.

586
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:43,666
Can you tell us anything
about your coworkers?

587
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,833
You don't mind if she answers a question
about a colleague, do you, Ms. Garran?

588
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:48,500
-Of course not.
-Good

589
00:38:48,583 --> 00:38:51,000
We understand
that you work with a Charlie Cullen.

590
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,708
-Yeah.
-Could he be involved in this?

591
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:57,250
I think you're jumping
to conclusions there, Officer.

592
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:58,958
Charlie wasn't there.

593
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:02,208
I mean, Ana died on the day shift.
Charlie and I both work nights.

594
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:06,541
We have no reasons to suspect
it was anything other than an accident.

595
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:07,791
Thank you, Amy.

596
00:39:09,291 --> 00:39:10,833
I know Charlie really well.

597
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:14,458
We work every shift together,
and he's a very good nurse.

598
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:16,375
He wouldn't have made a mistake like that.

599
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:17,500
Thank you, Amy.

600
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:25,916
-So where's that internal investigation?
-We're still reviewing everything.

601
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,625
Well, we don't need you to review it.
We'll just take it as it is.

602
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:33,750
I'll instruct the team
to send you the boxes tomorrow.

603
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:38,625
But I hope you can deduce
that, um… it's been a tough seven weeks.

604
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:39,750
Eight.

605
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:42,291
It's been eight weeks.

606
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:45,250
- Jack Ivins. July 19, '88.

607
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:49,500
Recovering from gallbladder surgery
on Thursday. There was no complications.

608
00:39:50,916 --> 00:39:51,750
Line in.

609
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:55,416
Gonna need you to get ready
to do another shock, 150 joules.

610
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:58,208
-Everybody clear.
-Clear.

611
00:39:58,291 --> 00:40:00,250
Deliver the shock. Shock.

612
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:01,958
Resume compressions.

613
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:05,666
One and two and three and four
and five and six…

614
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:09,000
-Compressions.
-Nine, ten, 11, 12, 13…

615
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:11,166
Hold compressions.
Let's check for a rhythm.

616
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,416
-I got nothing.
-Persistent V-fib.

617
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,583
Resume compressions.

618
00:40:15,708 --> 00:40:19,000
Let's get one milligram
of epinephrine IV started.

619
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,166
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten…

620
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:24,500
Let's get prepared
to give it another shock, 200 joules.

621
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:26,375
Epi ready. In line.

622
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:27,875
Continue your breathing.

623
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:30,083
-Twenty.
-Keep your compressions.

624
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:32,083
Talk to me.

625
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:33,833
-Is that epi ready?

626
00:40:33,916 --> 00:40:37,625
Swap in, five, four, three, two…

627
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:40,125
-You're all clear.

628
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:42,166
-Oxygen's clear.

629
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:45,125
I'm moving in.
Low pulse, low pulse.

630
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:48,000
-Shit, no pressure, still.

631
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:49,875
Four and five and six and seven

632
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:54,125
and eight and nine, ten,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

633
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:55,458
Shit.

634
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:57,666
Twenty-five. Now! Now!

635
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,750
Let's go!

636
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:40,375
Take these.

637
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:11,291
You'll get fired.

638
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,791
So there's a fault in the PYXIS.

639
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:21,375
So if you cancel a request late enough,
it opens anyway.

640
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,875
That's stealing meds, Charlie.

641
00:42:24,958 --> 00:42:30,041
Amy, stop. Now, please don't worry.
I'm gonna help you get through this.

642
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,625
Okay, thank you.

643
00:42:48,541 --> 00:42:50,583
Hey, what did he say?

644
00:42:59,916 --> 00:43:03,833
I think he's right.
I think you probably do need to tell Alex,

645
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:06,625
just in case something happens
and I'm not there.

646
00:43:08,958 --> 00:43:12,166
They don't have anyone but me.
I can't leave them.

647
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,208
No, you're not leaving them, Amy.

648
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:17,333
That's not happening.
It's… What is it? Two months?

649
00:43:17,416 --> 00:43:18,958
Okay, so I'm gonna help you do this.

650
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:22,250
Get your surgery, be with your girls.
That's what's happening.

651
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:26,458
Okay?

652
00:43:34,916 --> 00:43:36,750
But I think you should tell Alex.

653
00:44:01,416 --> 00:44:04,791
I know it sounds scary,
but… it really isn't.

654
00:44:05,625 --> 00:44:08,166
Everybody's hearts
have these ventricles.

655
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:09,791
-They're just these spaces.
-Yeah.

656
00:44:09,875 --> 00:44:12,666
They're two little spaces
like balloons that fill with blood.

657
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,166
-They move the blood around the body.
-Mm-hmm.

658
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:20,250
And um… mine, they just, you know,

659
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:27,208
they're too big,
and they just got a little thin.

660
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:33,333
But I am gonna be okay.
I've got medication.

661
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:38,750
I have doctors taking care of me,
and I'm gonna feel normal soon.

662
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:42,666
But your mom's gonna need our help, Alex.

663
00:44:43,166 --> 00:44:48,500
If she were to fall
or, um, you know, start speaking funny,

664
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:51,958
or you struggle to wake her or something,

665
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:54,000
then you just…
you put Maya in front of the TV,

666
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:56,041
you call 911, and then you call me.

667
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:58,708
Yeah, but that's not gonna happen.
It's not gonna happen.

668
00:45:02,916 --> 00:45:05,208
Everything's gonna be fine.
I'm gonna be okay.

669
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:10,833
Can I just go watch some TV?

670
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:16,208
Okay.

671
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:21,833
But I'll be here if you wanna…

672
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:28,083
<i>Charles Cullen with a C.</i>

673
00:45:28,166 --> 00:45:29,375
C-U-L-L-E-N.

674
00:45:29,875 --> 00:45:32,875
<i>Sure. Give me a second</i>
<i>while I pull up his records.</i>

675
00:45:33,458 --> 00:45:34,500
Great, thanks.

676
00:45:48,083 --> 00:45:50,791
<i>Okay, I just need</i>
<i>to check something with my boss.</i>

677
00:45:50,875 --> 00:45:53,125
Okay. Sure.

678
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:08,916
<i>Hello?</i>

679
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,125
Hello. Detective Braun here.
Uh, who am I talking to?

680
00:46:12,208 --> 00:46:15,041
<i>Mark Rossi.</i>
<i>Attorney for St. Aloysius Hospital Group.</i>

681
00:46:15,958 --> 00:46:19,125
Mr. Rossi, hi.
I'm hoping you can help me out.

682
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:22,291
I'm looking for some information
on one of your former employees

683
00:46:22,375 --> 00:46:24,250
from back in '96, Charles Cullen.

684
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:27,916
<i>Our employee data</i>
<i>is treated with strict confidentiality.</i>

685
00:46:29,083 --> 00:46:32,541
I'm just looking to confirm his dates
of employment, not much more than that.

686
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:35,041
<i>We'd be happy to release</i>
<i>any relevant information</i>

687
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,125
<i>as soon as we see your subpoena.</i>

688
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:39,416
Okay, yep, thank you so much.

689
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,416
<i>Thank you.</i>

690
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,750
This is a fucking joke.

691
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:45,208
Whenever they hear his name,
no one wants to say anything.

692
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:47,541
Detective Baldwin?

693
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:51,250
-Yeah.
-It's from Parkfield Memorial Hospital.

694
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:52,958
It's the internal investigation.

695
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:55,375
-Just need you to sign here.
-All right.

696
00:46:56,666 --> 00:46:59,416
-Need a hand with the boxes?
-No, it's just this.

697
00:47:03,041 --> 00:47:04,375
Have a great day.

698
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:19,541
-Ms. Garran.
-Detective Baldwin.

699
00:47:22,791 --> 00:47:25,166
Oh, thank you for seeing me.

700
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,083
Anything to help wrap this up.

701
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:32,333
So, I just have a couple of questions.

702
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:34,916
The "Pixie" report.
You have all the drug withdrawals--

703
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,333
Uh, PYXIS.

704
00:47:37,666 --> 00:47:38,708
That's right.

705
00:47:39,625 --> 00:47:42,833
Uh, so you've got all
of the, um, drug withdrawals

706
00:47:42,916 --> 00:47:44,166
for all of the nurses on this?

707
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:45,416
That's correct.

708
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,166
Well, I was hoping
I could get the full report,

709
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:51,333
because this one only has a short window
around Ana's expiration.

710
00:47:51,416 --> 00:47:55,458
I'm told it only stores the information
for four weeks.

711
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:59,416
Well, you must have gotten a copy
during the internal investigation, right?

712
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,375
I don't believe we did, no.

713
00:48:01,458 --> 00:48:05,166
I mean, I can check, but, uh…
everything we had was sent to you.

714
00:48:06,291 --> 00:48:08,541
You see, this is page nine,

715
00:48:08,625 --> 00:48:12,166
so pages one to eight
gotta be around here somewhere.

716
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,333
Hmm.

717
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:17,333
-Uh, I'll be sure to look into it.

718
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:23,041
Nurse Garran, it's looking a lot like
you're withholding some evidence here.

719
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:27,375
-I'm not sure I follow--
-Six pages. Where's the rest of it?

720
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:31,333
I'm sorry. I… I have another meeting,
and I can't shift it--

721
00:48:31,416 --> 00:48:33,083
Oh, I'm not done.

722
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:35,166
I'm gonna reschedule with your office.

723
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,833
Sit down.

724
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,541
-Excuse me--
-Sit the fuck down!

725
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:01,166
You know exactly what you're doing.

726
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:21,666
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

727
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:25,375
Um, I know you're not supposed
to have babies in here,

728
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:28,458
but I really didn't have
anyone else who could take her.

729
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:32,125
-It's okay.
-Thank you.

730
00:49:32,791 --> 00:49:35,166
-What's her name?
-Vanessa.

731
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,833
Messy Nessie.

732
00:49:36,916 --> 00:49:39,375
-Messy Nessie?
-Uh-huh.

733
00:49:39,458 --> 00:49:43,000
Well, I have two girls, so I hear that.

734
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:45,166
-Mm.
-How old is she?

735
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:46,166
Six months.

736
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:48,166
Oh. She sleeping through the night yet?

737
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:51,083
-No!
-She must be teething.

738
00:49:51,166 --> 00:49:52,708
-Oh, yeah.
-Uh-huh.

739
00:49:55,708 --> 00:49:59,041
Nurse Loughren? It's not urgent.
There's a Code Purple in 300.

740
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:00,708
Oh, okay.

741
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,375
What's a Code Purple?

742
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,833
It means pizza's arrived.
Do you want a slice?

743
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:08,916
Oh.

744
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,458
Well, I can't say no to pizza.

745
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:11,708
You can't.

746
00:50:11,791 --> 00:50:15,375
Unfortunately, though,
you're gonna have to say no to pizza.

747
00:50:15,458 --> 00:50:16,458
Okay.

748
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:20,916
But you are healing nicely,
and will be holding Vanessa in no time.

749
00:50:21,666 --> 00:50:24,916
She told me to go fuck myself
15 times on the phone.

750
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,166
Oh my God.

751
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:28,333
That's not nice.

752
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:30,750
I haven't even told you the best part.

753
00:50:30,833 --> 00:50:33,916
So now, to try and stop me
from seeing the girls,

754
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,250
she has made up a story
about me being mean to her dog.

755
00:50:39,958 --> 00:50:42,958
I'm not kidding.
It gets better and better.

756
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:46,666
Honestly, the whole thing
would be hilarious if it wasn't true.

757
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:48,333
I'm sorry.

758
00:50:48,416 --> 00:50:50,958
No. Are you kidding?
It's my own fault.

759
00:50:51,041 --> 00:50:52,666
I picked a crazy.

760
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:59,000
<i>Oh, you know,</i>
<i>it works for me.</i>

761
00:50:59,083 --> 00:51:01,375
<i>I mean, it's not, like… quickly.</i>

762
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:03,500
-<i>Right.</i>
-<i>What did you say?</i>

763
00:51:03,583 --> 00:51:05,125
<i>Nothing. Nothing, bro.</i>

764
00:51:05,208 --> 00:51:07,916
-<i>You said a… word.</i>
<i>I didn't.</i>

765
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:10,916
Two minutes, girls.

766
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,416
Okay. Do you wanna get
your backpack and coat?

767
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,458
-You want a ponytail for school?
-Sure.

768
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:21,500
Beautiful hair.

769
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:25,375
I wish we could stay home.

770
00:51:31,541 --> 00:51:32,958
I wish that too.

771
00:51:47,125 --> 00:51:48,583
-Wanna get your jacket?
-Yeah.

772
00:51:48,666 --> 00:51:49,875
-Love you.
-Love you.

773
00:51:57,333 --> 00:51:59,083
What else is in that?
Anything new?

774
00:51:59,166 --> 00:52:00,125
Um…

775
00:52:01,333 --> 00:52:04,333
Yeah, there was a list
of all the medications

776
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:06,458
that were in Ana Martinez's system.

777
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:08,500
-Insulin?
-Yeah, and another one.

778
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:11,041
Get this. Digoxin.

779
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:14,416
-Digoxin?

780
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,375
Baldwin!

781
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,875
-Are you serious?
-Shit.

782
00:52:19,458 --> 00:52:20,958
Screaming at her.

783
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:23,750
Malcolm Burrel from City Council
just called.

784
00:52:23,833 --> 00:52:27,041
Danny will be happy
to apologize to Mrs. Garran.

785
00:52:27,125 --> 00:52:31,000
Well, too late. You've both been banned
from the hospital property.

786
00:52:31,083 --> 00:52:32,500
What?

787
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:35,333
Can't ban us from the scene of a crime
that we're investigating.

788
00:52:35,416 --> 00:52:37,083
-What crime?
-Homicide.

789
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:38,791
What do you have to back this up?

790
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:41,875
The files and an interview with a nurse

791
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:44,375
who was certain
that the victim was given insulin.

792
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:45,333
Victim, what victim?

793
00:52:45,416 --> 00:52:46,666
Ana Martinez.

794
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,625
You have no body.

795
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:52,625
No body, no autopsy.
You know how this works.

796
00:53:02,458 --> 00:53:04,416
Banned from the fuckin' hospital?

797
00:53:11,416 --> 00:53:14,333
Hey, Kelly.
Tom called to check on you.

798
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:18,958
I cannot get over
how cute that little Vanessa is.

799
00:53:20,416 --> 00:53:22,083
Who's Vanessa?

800
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:31,916
Kelly, do you know
where you are right now?

801
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,583
I need you to answer me, hon.

802
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:39,333
I'm at the hospital.

803
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:40,500
Which hospital?

804
00:53:45,083 --> 00:53:46,208
Uh…

805
00:53:46,708 --> 00:53:47,791
All right.

806
00:53:48,416 --> 00:53:49,583
Squeeze my hands.

807
00:53:51,166 --> 00:53:52,583
Come on. Squeeze my hands.

808
00:53:55,125 --> 00:53:56,250
A little light.

809
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,083
Has Tom come by?

810
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:10,875
He called to check on you.

811
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:17,583
-Hey, Tom, it's Amy from the hospital.
<i>-Hi, Amy. What's going on?</i>

812
00:54:18,125 --> 00:54:21,708
I really think that you should come in.
There's been a change overnight.

813
00:54:26,125 --> 00:54:28,791
I think you should come in
sooner rather than later.

814
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:30,666
Okay, see you soon.

815
00:54:31,166 --> 00:54:33,250
I checked in with Beth.
She's still sleeping.

816
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:36,333
-Jack's been pushing on his call button--
-Oh my God.

817
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:37,833
What?

818
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:40,666
There's insulin in her system.

819
00:54:50,333 --> 00:54:52,625
<i>Code Blue. Wing West.</i>

820
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,541
<i>Code Blue. Wing West.</i>

821
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:00,291
<i>Code Blue. Wing West.</i>

822
00:56:15,583 --> 00:56:17,916
Oh my God! Oh God!

823
00:56:19,166 --> 00:56:20,250
-No!

824
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:22,208
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

825
00:56:23,958 --> 00:56:25,958
Oh God!

826
00:56:28,166 --> 00:56:30,000
Oh my God!

827
00:56:40,791 --> 00:56:43,291
-It's okay.

828
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:19,250
Shit.

829
00:57:22,458 --> 00:57:24,958
Hello. Sorry to bother you like this.

830
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:26,083
Yeah, no.

831
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,125
We need your help, Amy.

832
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:33,458
Look, I'm sorry, guys. I… Really,
I don't know what happened to her.

833
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:35,125
To who?

834
00:57:35,791 --> 00:57:38,125
Kelly Anderson. I… I mean…

835
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:40,708
Who's Kelly Anderson?

836
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:43,083
Is there another victim?

837
00:57:44,416 --> 00:57:46,500
Another double-medication error?

838
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:51,041
Was Cullen with Kelly Anderson?

839
00:57:51,541 --> 00:57:53,166
This has nothing to do with Charlie.

840
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:55,208
-How well do you know him?
-Really well.

841
00:57:55,291 --> 00:57:56,250
Do you?

842
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,750
He's been at nine hospitals.

843
00:57:59,833 --> 00:58:01,833
And none of 'em will talk to us.

844
00:58:02,791 --> 00:58:04,166
What do you mean? I'm…

845
00:58:07,958 --> 00:58:10,791
No. If something had happened,
he wouldn't have been able to get a job.

846
00:58:10,875 --> 00:58:13,666
-The hospital would have done something.
-You'd think so.

847
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:14,750
Yeah.

848
00:58:16,166 --> 00:58:17,958
They're stonewalling us.

849
00:58:20,166 --> 00:58:21,750
You have to help us.

850
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:25,958
Mom, are you coming?

851
00:58:27,458 --> 00:58:31,583
Hey, honey. Yeah, I'll be in in a second.
Just wait inside, okay?

852
00:58:31,666 --> 00:58:32,791
Okay.

853
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:37,291
Guys, I can't talk right now.
My kid's here. Like…

854
00:58:39,958 --> 00:58:42,458
Okay. Here's my card.

855
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:46,375
Give me a call.
Maybe he's not who you think.

856
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:50,458
Have a nice day.

857
00:58:50,541 --> 00:58:51,625
Thanks.

858
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:15,000
Hey.

859
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:16,458
Hey.

860
00:59:19,666 --> 00:59:21,583
-Do you need anything?
-Mm-mm.

861
00:59:21,666 --> 00:59:23,125
-No?
-I'm fine.

862
00:59:24,083 --> 00:59:26,250
Okay. You let me know if you feel tired.

863
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:27,875
I'm not. I will. I feel good.

864
00:59:27,958 --> 00:59:29,000
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

865
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:32,125
-Okay.
-Mm.

866
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:21,041
Amy fucking Loughren!

867
01:00:21,125 --> 01:00:22,666
-Pocket Rocket!
-Mm!

868
01:00:24,375 --> 01:00:27,666
-It is so good to see you!
-I know. You look so good.

869
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:30,708
-Really?
-Yes! You look great.

870
01:00:30,791 --> 01:00:32,125
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

871
01:00:32,208 --> 01:00:34,541
-I feel exhausted.
-Hi there! You ready to order?

872
01:00:34,625 --> 01:00:36,958
-Oh, I'll have a cheese omelet.
-Okay.

873
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:39,625
-And what pairs best with that?
-Chardonnay.

874
01:00:39,708 --> 01:00:43,166
Oh. A large cold glass of dry chardonnay.

875
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,375
-Okay.
-I'll have the same.

876
01:00:44,458 --> 01:00:45,791
-Thanks.
-Coming right up.

877
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:48,083
When was the last time
we were in this dive?

878
01:00:48,166 --> 01:00:50,833
A long time ago. Like, at least a decade.

879
01:00:50,916 --> 01:00:52,583
-What?
-Twelve years?

880
01:00:52,666 --> 01:00:54,625
-Ugh, Jesus.

881
01:00:54,708 --> 01:00:56,625
-I'm getting old.
-Here we go.

882
01:00:56,708 --> 01:00:57,791
Thank you.

883
01:00:58,333 --> 01:00:59,375
How's Paul?

884
01:01:00,041 --> 01:01:01,541
Uh, we split up.

885
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:03,791
-Oh shit.
-I mean, it's not a big deal.

886
01:01:03,875 --> 01:01:08,250
It was a long time ago,
and we share custody of the dogs.

887
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:14,375
We worked hard to come to that agreement.
I'm so glad that you called.

888
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:17,083
Mm! Me too.

889
01:01:17,166 --> 01:01:19,375
Just, you know, I wanted to…
I wanted to ask you…

890
01:01:19,458 --> 01:01:21,708
It's… It's a little weird.

891
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,875
I love weird.

892
01:01:22,958 --> 01:01:27,250
But, um… do you remember working
with someone named Charlie Cullen?

893
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,625
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

894
01:01:33,208 --> 01:01:34,041
Why?

895
01:01:34,125 --> 01:01:36,666
Well, I'm working with him
right now at Parkfield.

896
01:01:39,666 --> 01:01:41,666
There was a rumor about him.

897
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:44,083
That he was responsible for a death.

898
01:01:44,166 --> 01:01:45,666
That he OD'd someone.

899
01:01:50,416 --> 01:01:51,416
Oh.

900
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,208
Uh, with what?

901
01:01:53,291 --> 01:01:56,666
They found insulin
in the dead guy's saline bag.

902
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:58,500
They found it in a few.

903
01:01:59,041 --> 01:02:01,000
Pinpricks in the ones in the store.

904
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:04,250
Somebody had dosed them
before they went out.

905
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:09,916
Why did they think it was Charlie?

906
01:02:10,708 --> 01:02:12,000
They didn't.

907
01:02:12,083 --> 01:02:15,375
But we used to get codes every night.
Sometimes two or three.

908
01:02:15,458 --> 01:02:16,958
And then after he left,

909
01:02:18,291 --> 01:02:20,833
we got, like, only one a month.

910
01:02:28,916 --> 01:02:30,541
You get a lot of codes?

911
01:03:32,125 --> 01:03:33,166
Okay.

912
01:03:38,375 --> 01:03:39,500
Oh God.

913
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:03,750
Oh!

914
01:05:07,416 --> 01:05:08,250
Hmm.

915
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:09,291
Hey.

916
01:05:12,166 --> 01:05:13,583
Easy, easy.

917
01:05:13,666 --> 01:05:16,500
You're okay. You're okay. It's okay.

918
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:20,541
-Amy, it's okay.

919
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:23,708
You're in the ED. You're doing great.

920
01:05:26,625 --> 01:05:29,333
I checked on the girls.
Jackie's with them.

921
01:05:30,708 --> 01:05:32,291
I can go get 'em, bring 'em here.

922
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:34,250
- No.
-No? Okay.

923
01:05:41,708 --> 01:05:42,916
You want some water?

924
01:05:52,583 --> 01:05:53,583
No?

925
01:05:59,583 --> 01:06:02,208
Don't you ever scare me
like that again please.

926
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:05,166
-I wanna leave.
-I know, I know.

927
01:06:05,791 --> 01:06:06,625
I get it.

928
01:06:07,208 --> 01:06:08,875
We're not gonna let them find out.

929
01:06:10,041 --> 01:06:12,333
Where… Where's the nurse?

930
01:06:12,416 --> 01:06:15,458
Uh, don't worry.
Your last pressure looked pretty good.

931
01:06:15,541 --> 01:06:18,208
Your heart rate's been below 80
for the last hour.

932
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:22,791
I saw the labs, and your troponin's high,
but it's trending down.

933
01:06:22,875 --> 01:06:24,625
So you're good. You're okay.

934
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:29,791
You're lucky. Could've been a lot worse.

935
01:06:29,875 --> 01:06:32,250
-I wanna go home.
-I know.

936
01:06:32,333 --> 01:06:34,708
-Okay.
-Hey. Saw her heart rate blip up.

937
01:06:34,791 --> 01:06:36,375
-You awake?
-Yeah--

938
01:06:36,458 --> 01:06:38,166
Bring me a discharge form.

939
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:40,791
Hey. I don't think that's a good idea.
She should stay overnight.

940
01:06:40,875 --> 01:06:42,916
-Yeah, we got this.
-I wanna leave AMA.

941
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,083
-You sure?

942
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:46,875
I'll drive her home.
Make sure she's looked after. Thank you.

943
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:49,125
-We're good. Thank you.

944
01:06:49,916 --> 01:06:50,916
Hey.

945
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:54,208
-Please, stop.

946
01:06:56,416 --> 01:06:57,750
Okay.

947
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:03,291
Give me your arm.

948
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,375
So you sure you don't want me to come in?

949
01:07:22,958 --> 01:07:25,541
I'm happy to sleep on the couch. I can…

950
01:07:29,583 --> 01:07:33,208
-I can take the girls to school.
-I don't wanna scare them.

951
01:07:35,291 --> 01:07:37,916
Nothing's gonna happen.
I just… I just need to sleep.

952
01:07:38,416 --> 01:07:40,291
-You're right.

953
01:07:41,916 --> 01:07:43,541
-Thanks, Charlie.
-Yeah.

954
01:07:46,791 --> 01:07:48,458
But if you need anything…

955
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I'll call you.

956
01:07:52,083 --> 01:07:53,041
Yeah?

957
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:00,166
It's a month, Amy.

958
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:04,041
We got this.

959
01:08:09,666 --> 01:08:11,416
You're freezing. Go.

960
01:08:18,875 --> 01:08:19,916
Call me.

961
01:08:34,166 --> 01:08:35,750
It has to be a secret.

962
01:08:42,458 --> 01:08:43,791
Oh God.

963
01:08:46,125 --> 01:08:47,500
No one can know.

964
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,333
I'll get fired.

965
01:08:51,541 --> 01:08:52,666
Understood.

966
01:08:54,333 --> 01:08:56,166
He does it in the storage room…

967
01:08:57,958 --> 01:08:59,458
before it even goes out.

968
01:09:00,041 --> 01:09:02,208
He injects the insulin into the bags,

969
01:09:02,291 --> 01:09:05,541
and because it enters
the bloodstream slowly,

970
01:09:05,625 --> 01:09:08,833
it could take hours
or even, you know, a day to kill someone.

971
01:09:12,541 --> 01:09:14,750
So he's killing 'em
without ever touching 'em.

972
01:09:14,833 --> 01:09:18,291
Could he put something other than insulin
inside those bags?

973
01:09:20,166 --> 01:09:22,500
Yeah, any clear liquid
wouldn't be detected.

974
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:25,458
Is digoxin a clear liquid?

975
01:09:26,791 --> 01:09:27,750
Yeah.

976
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:30,250
Could it kill someone?

977
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,416
Okay, and the nurse you met with,
you think she'll talk to us?

978
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:44,541
No.

979
01:09:45,125 --> 01:09:46,875
No, she'll lose her job.

980
01:09:46,958 --> 01:09:51,000
Do you mind taking a look
at what we got here from Parkfield?

981
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:52,666
Where's the rest of it?

982
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:55,833
That's it. That's all we have.
That's all they gave us.

983
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,666
The PYXIS report's just two pages.

984
01:09:59,291 --> 01:10:01,583
They said it only keeps the file
for four weeks.

985
01:10:01,666 --> 01:10:03,083
No, it's a computer.

986
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:06,833
It keeps the information
for as long as it was installed. It's…

987
01:10:15,541 --> 01:10:20,375
I'll pull Charlie's PYXIS report
from the machine in my ward,

988
01:10:20,458 --> 01:10:24,250
and we'll use that to prove
that he withdrew insulin

989
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:26,291
and digoxin when Ana died.

990
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:30,000
Yeah, see, the problem is
that Ana Martinez was cremated,

991
01:10:30,083 --> 01:10:32,041
so we don't have an autopsy.

992
01:10:32,833 --> 01:10:35,416
What we need is an actual body.

993
01:13:48,208 --> 01:13:50,916
As you know, we got permission
from Kelly Anderson's husband

994
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,958
to dig up her body for examination.

995
01:13:53,041 --> 01:13:56,083
From the autopsy, we know
that a combination of insulin and digoxin

996
01:13:56,166 --> 01:13:57,958
were in Kelly's system
and led to her death

997
01:13:58,041 --> 01:13:59,541
in the early hours of the 15th.

998
01:13:59,625 --> 01:14:03,250
Right,
and then on the 14th at 20:47,

999
01:14:03,333 --> 01:14:08,000
you see that Charlie took out
insulin and digoxin from the PYXIS.

1000
01:14:10,375 --> 01:14:14,041
And if you see Kelly's report,

1001
01:14:14,125 --> 01:14:17,208
her blood sugar just drops at 21:56,

1002
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:19,916
so that is the insulin taking effect.

1003
01:14:20,416 --> 01:14:22,791
And there's slow arrhythmia at 22:15,

1004
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:25,000
and that's digoxin.

1005
01:14:25,083 --> 01:14:29,458
So he was holding two murder weapons.
3:57 is the time of death.

1006
01:14:29,541 --> 01:14:30,708
Everything's there.

1007
01:14:30,791 --> 01:14:32,208
Wait a second. Hold on.

1008
01:14:33,125 --> 01:14:37,041
With this PYXIS, it says cancellations,
not withdrawals.

1009
01:14:37,125 --> 01:14:39,000
Well, it's a fault in the system.

1010
01:14:39,083 --> 01:14:42,041
So when you cancel at the last minute,
the drawer opens,

1011
01:14:42,125 --> 01:14:44,166
but it reports it as a cancellation.

1012
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,666
And Cullen knows about that?

1013
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:47,291
Yeah, and I saw him do it.

1014
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:50,583
Insulin, digoxin.
There's hundreds of orders here.

1015
01:14:50,666 --> 01:14:55,166
Okay, but not according to this.
This makes it look like he never got 'em.

1016
01:14:56,208 --> 01:14:57,166
But he did.

1017
01:14:57,833 --> 01:14:59,666
Did you actually see him do this?

1018
01:15:08,375 --> 01:15:10,333
Guys, this is the smoking gun right here.

1019
01:15:10,416 --> 01:15:12,791
Yeah, but this isn't.

1020
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:16,125
It's just cancellations.
There's nothing nefarious.

1021
01:15:16,208 --> 01:15:18,208
There's no proof of guilt. There's--

1022
01:15:18,291 --> 01:15:21,291
Okay, he's been doing this
since he started at Parkfield, so look.

1023
01:15:21,375 --> 01:15:24,625
Look at all
of these repeated cancellations, right?

1024
01:15:24,708 --> 01:15:28,125
Look. They're not followed up
with a correct order.

1025
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:31,875
He's had repeated orders
of vec and digoxin.

1026
01:15:31,958 --> 01:15:35,333
I mean, it's really--
It just screams wrong. It's…

1027
01:15:35,416 --> 01:15:39,083
Maybe. Maybe Parkfield
just didn't understand.

1028
01:15:39,166 --> 01:15:42,625
Come on, guys.
Linda Garran used to be a nurse.

1029
01:15:43,791 --> 01:15:44,958
She understood.

1030
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:49,791
Oh yeah, she knows,
and she's not doing anything.

1031
01:16:01,166 --> 01:16:03,750
Nurse Cullen, thank you
for coming in on your day off.

1032
01:16:03,833 --> 01:16:05,750
Hi, you can call me Charlie.

1033
01:16:12,708 --> 01:16:16,083
Uh… We've come across something troubling.

1034
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,000
What hospital were you employed at
before you took the position here?

1035
01:16:24,458 --> 01:16:25,750
St. Elizabeth's.

1036
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:29,166
And what were your dates
of employment there?

1037
01:16:29,791 --> 01:16:30,750
Uh…

1038
01:16:31,791 --> 01:16:34,625
I'm not sure.
Is there an issue from St. Elizabeth's?

1039
01:16:34,708 --> 01:16:39,416
'Cause I was targeted by some coworkers.
I don't know. Maybe they're at it again.

1040
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:42,833
What we're concerned with are the dates
you listed on your application.

1041
01:16:42,916 --> 01:16:44,791
Do you remember what they were?

1042
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:46,916
Um…

1043
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:54,583
June '01 to August '03, maybe.

1044
01:16:54,666 --> 01:16:56,416
-Yes, that's what you wrote.
-Right.

1045
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,750
Those dates are incorrect, Mr. Cullen.

1046
01:16:58,833 --> 01:16:59,791
Oh.

1047
01:16:59,875 --> 01:17:02,833
St. Elizabeth's confirmed with us
that you were employed from May,

1048
01:17:02,916 --> 01:17:06,916
so these discrepancies
on your application form

1049
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,500
leave us with no option but to let you go

1050
01:17:10,291 --> 01:17:11,875
with immediate effect.

1051
01:17:14,125 --> 01:17:17,666
Wait, so you're firing me for writing
the wrong dates on my application?

1052
01:17:21,916 --> 01:17:23,875
It… It is in the contract.

1053
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:35,958
Well, I believe I need to sign something.

1054
01:18:12,958 --> 01:18:13,833
Is that all?

1055
01:18:14,541 --> 01:18:15,750
That's all.

1056
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,333
Thank you, Mr. Cullen.

1057
01:19:02,625 --> 01:19:07,416
I just got news from Parkfield.
They've dealt with the Cullen issue.

1058
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,875
-What does that mean?
-He's been fired.

1059
01:19:11,166 --> 01:19:13,583
-What?
-So they're just gonna let him go?

1060
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:15,750
Well, what did they say?

1061
01:19:15,833 --> 01:19:19,708
That they fired him because they found
some discrepancy in his paperwork.

1062
01:19:20,916 --> 01:19:23,916
Well, what was his state of mind?
Was he stable?

1063
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,791
Wait, you don't think that this could
make him more dangerous, do you?

1064
01:19:27,875 --> 01:19:31,375
At least he can't be
anywhere near patients.

1065
01:19:31,458 --> 01:19:33,250
He can't hurt anyone.

1066
01:19:34,666 --> 01:19:37,625
He's been at nine hospitals. Nine.

1067
01:19:37,708 --> 01:19:39,458
What don't you understand?

1068
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:42,250
They all say the same thing.
They cover up their own liabilities.

1069
01:19:42,333 --> 01:19:44,541
It happens again and again and again.

1070
01:19:44,625 --> 01:19:46,750
He's gonna get a new job
at another hospital,

1071
01:19:46,833 --> 01:19:48,291
and it's all gonna continue.

1072
01:19:49,958 --> 01:19:51,208
You allowed this.

1073
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:56,166
Don't look at me.

1074
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:57,708
You did.

1075
01:20:05,791 --> 01:20:07,625
-Jackie, I'm back.
-Maya.

1076
01:20:08,416 --> 01:20:11,500
-Oh my God!
-Maya! Can you just say your line?

1077
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:12,666
Hey, girls.

1078
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:14,083
I forgot it.

1079
01:20:17,625 --> 01:20:18,500
Wow.

1080
01:20:26,083 --> 01:20:27,125
What?

1081
01:20:35,541 --> 01:20:37,291
Don't you have the script?

1082
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,541
-I don't have the script.
-Oh my God.

1083
01:20:41,625 --> 01:20:43,458
Okay, I lost it.

1084
01:20:43,541 --> 01:20:46,250
Maya, you've done this
so many times!

1085
01:20:46,333 --> 01:20:49,125
Okay, Alex, be nice to your sister.

1086
01:20:49,208 --> 01:20:51,125
Maya's speaking
over Charlie's part again.

1087
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,250
What are you doing here?

1088
01:20:56,291 --> 01:20:57,291
Rehearsing.

1089
01:20:59,166 --> 01:21:00,250
Where's Jackie?

1090
01:21:00,833 --> 01:21:03,791
I told her she could go home.
It was just gonna be us tonight.

1091
01:21:03,875 --> 01:21:05,125
We cooked!

1092
01:21:05,208 --> 01:21:07,125
-We did.
-Charlie cooked.

1093
01:21:07,208 --> 01:21:08,875
-I helped.
-No, you didn't.

1094
01:21:08,958 --> 01:21:11,291
-Yes, I did!
-No, you didn't.

1095
01:21:11,375 --> 01:21:13,666
-Yes, I did!
-Alex, we all cooked.

1096
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:16,208
Why are you being weird, Mom?

1097
01:21:16,833 --> 01:21:17,875
I'm not.

1098
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:22,458
-We're making something special.
-It's his mom's recipe.

1099
01:21:22,541 --> 01:21:23,791
-Come.
-Yummy!

1100
01:21:23,875 --> 01:21:27,458
Sit, relax.
Enjoy the "Mayor of Humdrum Falls."

1101
01:21:27,541 --> 01:21:29,541
Should we get your mom
to play Mop Hopsley?

1102
01:21:29,625 --> 01:21:30,541
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

1103
01:21:30,625 --> 01:21:31,833
Alex…

1104
01:21:33,708 --> 01:21:35,083
Maya, please come here.

1105
01:21:37,666 --> 01:21:40,333
-Why?
-'Cause I'm asking you to. Come here.

1106
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:42,125
I don't want to.

1107
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:43,458
Hey, go to your mom.

1108
01:21:43,541 --> 01:21:44,416
Get over here.

1109
01:21:46,125 --> 01:21:47,375
Get over here right now!

1110
01:21:47,458 --> 01:21:49,625
But why? I'm having fun.

1111
01:21:52,875 --> 01:21:55,041
Go to your room. Go.

1112
01:21:55,833 --> 01:21:57,458
Why is she so angry?

1113
01:21:58,500 --> 01:21:59,583
I don't know.

1114
01:22:05,583 --> 01:22:07,333
So I'm guessing you heard.

1115
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:10,583
Yeah.

1116
01:22:14,375 --> 01:22:15,583
She say why?

1117
01:22:17,333 --> 01:22:18,250
Mm-mm.

1118
01:22:22,125 --> 01:22:26,958
They fired me because I wrote the wrong
dates on my application form apparently.

1119
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:29,250
Oh.

1120
01:22:29,333 --> 01:22:30,625
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1121
01:22:35,833 --> 01:22:37,875
It's been a wacko day.

1122
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:44,541
It's been a wacko couple of months.
Actually it's… Ugh.

1123
01:22:45,291 --> 01:22:49,041
You know, I wasn't even meant
to be working here.

1124
01:22:49,125 --> 01:22:52,666
I took this job
because I wanted to be close to my kids.

1125
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:57,166
Then when I get here,
she won't even let me see them,

1126
01:22:57,250 --> 01:23:01,958
and then she starts making up this
insane stuff about poisoning the dog,

1127
01:23:02,041 --> 01:23:03,791
and then this, you know…

1128
01:23:12,833 --> 01:23:14,916
I think the universe hates me, Amy.

1129
01:23:15,625 --> 01:23:17,333
-Really.
-Charlie--

1130
01:23:17,416 --> 01:23:20,458
-At this point.
-You know that's not true.

1131
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:26,416
I'm really sorry this happened to you.

1132
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:30,333
No, please. I'm sorry, 'cause I know
you've still got three more weeks,

1133
01:23:30,416 --> 01:23:32,208
and I'm not gonna be there to help.

1134
01:23:32,291 --> 01:23:33,958
But I can… I can help here.

1135
01:23:34,041 --> 01:23:36,750
I can, like, look after them,
I can make sure you eat.

1136
01:23:36,833 --> 01:23:38,083
Anything you need.

1137
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,625
Really. Anything.

1138
01:23:43,958 --> 01:23:45,458
That's all right.

1139
01:23:51,166 --> 01:23:54,125
Did I tell you
Alex blew up the other day?

1140
01:23:54,208 --> 01:23:55,541
-No.
-Yeah.

1141
01:23:56,041 --> 01:23:57,208
She just lost it.

1142
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,916
She was crying and screaming,
and, like…

1143
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,541
She's really struggling.

1144
01:24:03,291 --> 01:24:05,458
I'm working so much, so…

1145
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:08,958
I'm so sorry.
I mean, you know, it's a lot, you know?

1146
01:24:09,458 --> 01:24:13,625
But what I think would be
really helpful to me is, um…

1147
01:24:14,416 --> 01:24:17,000
if I could spend some time alone
with them, you know?

1148
01:24:17,083 --> 01:24:18,583
Just me and the girls.

1149
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:25,833
And I feel really bad saying this to you,

1150
01:24:25,916 --> 01:24:31,375
because I know that this has been
a day from hell for you.

1151
01:24:31,458 --> 01:24:35,208
I mean, Charlie, honestly,
you've had the year from hell.

1152
01:24:35,291 --> 01:24:36,166
No.

1153
01:24:36,958 --> 01:24:38,291
And, um…

1154
01:24:41,083 --> 01:24:42,916
God, I wish I could be there for you.

1155
01:24:46,125 --> 01:24:48,250
-I just feel like shit. I'm so sorry.
-No.

1156
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,791
Amy, stop. I get it. Please.

1157
01:24:50,875 --> 01:24:53,625
It's… It's your kids. They need this.

1158
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:55,083
Yeah.

1159
01:24:58,916 --> 01:25:00,333
And you're a good mom.

1160
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:03,916
-No, look at me.

1161
01:25:06,541 --> 01:25:07,750
You're a good mom.

1162
01:25:13,666 --> 01:25:14,583
Mm.

1163
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:19,875
-Okay.
-I'm glad I can help.

1164
01:25:26,375 --> 01:25:27,833
Promise me you'll eat.

1165
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:31,125
-It smells good.

1166
01:25:31,208 --> 01:25:33,291
It's my mom's recipe, you know.

1167
01:25:34,458 --> 01:25:35,916
-Okay.
-You know what?

1168
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,291
Just, actually, just, like, sitting here,
talking to you,

1169
01:25:39,375 --> 01:25:40,875
being with you…

1170
01:25:42,625 --> 01:25:44,875
it made me realize
everything's gonna be okay.

1171
01:25:44,958 --> 01:25:46,041
I've got you.

1172
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:50,041
I got Maya and Alex. I got my girls.

1173
01:25:51,375 --> 01:25:53,250
It's a job. I can get a job.

1174
01:25:55,375 --> 01:25:56,416
You can.

1175
01:26:06,125 --> 01:26:07,166
Yeah.

1176
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:15,791
Night.

1177
01:27:28,625 --> 01:27:29,791
Charlie? Hey.

1178
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:31,416
<i>Oh, hey.</i>

1179
01:27:32,166 --> 01:27:33,375
-I was, um--
<i>-You okay?</i>

1180
01:27:33,458 --> 01:27:35,250
Yes! I…

1181
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,416
You know, I wanna apologize
for being so weird yesterday.

1182
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,416
Like, last night, it was just…

1183
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:44,666
<i>-No. Stop.</i>
Sorry.

1184
01:27:46,166 --> 01:27:48,333
<i>Did you and Alex</i>
<i>get some time after I left?</i>

1185
01:27:48,416 --> 01:27:50,666
We did. Yeah, thank you.

1186
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:52,083
<i>Yeah? Oh, good.</i>

1187
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:55,291
<i>I think… You know, I think that you…</i>
<i>Like, both of you needed that.</i>

1188
01:27:55,375 --> 01:27:56,291
Mm!

1189
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:59,333
<i>I'm glad I could help.</i>

1190
01:28:01,458 --> 01:28:05,125
You… You know,
I'm about to go to work, and…

1191
01:28:05,916 --> 01:28:10,625
Charlie, it bothers me so much
that you're not gonna be there.

1192
01:28:11,166 --> 01:28:13,916
<i>I know. I know. I miss you too.</i>

1193
01:28:15,875 --> 01:28:19,125
<i>You wanna go to the park or something?</i>
<i>With the girls?</i>

1194
01:28:22,916 --> 01:28:24,375
Um…

1195
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:27,666
<i>Amy?</i>

1196
01:28:29,208 --> 01:28:30,583
Uh, maybe lunch?

1197
01:28:31,625 --> 01:28:32,875
<i>-Uh, yeah.</i>
Okay.

1198
01:28:32,958 --> 01:28:35,500
<i>Lunch. Uh… Lunch works. When's good?</i>

1199
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:38,541
Uh, let me think

1200
01:28:39,541 --> 01:28:40,791
for a moment.

1201
01:28:40,875 --> 01:28:42,000
Um…

1202
01:28:42,875 --> 01:28:43,958
Saturday?

1203
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,625
<i>Uh… Yeah. Saturday works.</i>

1204
01:28:48,208 --> 01:28:51,458
But I have to go to work now,
so I'll find a place.

1205
01:28:51,541 --> 01:28:54,500
<i>-Just text me</i>
<i>-I</i>'ll… I'll… I'll send you the details.

1206
01:28:55,375 --> 01:28:56,291
<i>-Okay.</i>
-Okay, bye.

1207
01:28:56,375 --> 01:28:57,875
<i>-Say hi to Sandra for me.</i>
-Oh, I will.

1208
01:28:57,958 --> 01:28:59,500
<i>-Okay. Bye.</i>
-Bye.

1209
01:28:59,583 --> 01:29:02,083
<i> See you later. Bye-bye.</i>

1210
01:29:07,583 --> 01:29:08,416
Great job.

1211
01:29:09,041 --> 01:29:10,500
So you remember
what we talked about?

1212
01:29:10,583 --> 01:29:12,750
The only way we can stop him
is if he admits to doing it,

1213
01:29:12,833 --> 01:29:14,666
so we gotta get him to confess.

1214
01:29:23,916 --> 01:29:26,125
<i>Oh fuck. Um…</i>

1215
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:31,250
Man, her pulse is racing.

1216
01:29:37,416 --> 01:29:39,500
Okay, well,
I hope you guys can hear me.

1217
01:29:45,333 --> 01:29:46,291
Right.

1218
01:29:55,666 --> 01:29:57,083
Oh fuck.

1219
01:29:58,958 --> 01:30:00,541
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1220
01:30:07,916 --> 01:30:09,416
He's walking in right now.

1221
01:30:13,833 --> 01:30:15,333
Hey!

1222
01:30:16,041 --> 01:30:16,958
Hey.

1223
01:30:17,041 --> 01:30:18,250
Hello.

1224
01:30:18,333 --> 01:30:20,083
Hi. How's it going?

1225
01:30:20,166 --> 01:30:21,333
Well, you know.

1226
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:22,666
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1227
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:24,416
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1228
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:25,833
I like this place.

1229
01:30:29,958 --> 01:30:31,416
What's going on?

1230
01:30:33,833 --> 01:30:35,458
Whew.

1231
01:30:35,541 --> 01:30:37,416
So can I get you guys something to drink?

1232
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:40,125
-Uh, I'll get an iced tea, please.
-Iced tea.

1233
01:30:40,708 --> 01:30:43,541
I will just have water. Thanks.

1234
01:30:45,666 --> 01:30:46,750
What do you think?

1235
01:30:48,458 --> 01:30:52,750
I'm starting a new job tonight.
Hoping these will make a good impression.

1236
01:30:54,375 --> 01:30:56,208
-Where?
-Elmsworth.

1237
01:30:56,291 --> 01:30:58,625
-You're starting at Elmsworth tonight?
-Yeah. Tonight, yeah.

1238
01:30:58,708 --> 01:31:01,666
Got all my stuff in the car,
ready for a new start.

1239
01:31:02,666 --> 01:31:04,958
That's… Wow, Charlie.

1240
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,166
You ready to order?

1241
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:12,333
Oh. Uh… You know, I'll get a…
I'll get a cheeseburger.

1242
01:31:13,291 --> 01:31:15,166
-Me too.
-All right.

1243
01:31:15,250 --> 01:31:16,958
-So…
-Two cheeseburgers, please!

1244
01:31:17,041 --> 01:31:18,333
How are the girls?

1245
01:31:18,416 --> 01:31:20,208
-Thank you.
-They're really good.

1246
01:31:21,208 --> 01:31:22,416
How's the mayor?

1247
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:23,708
Yeah, she's great.

1248
01:31:23,791 --> 01:31:24,958
Feeling better?

1249
01:31:25,583 --> 01:31:26,583
Yeah.

1250
01:31:28,583 --> 01:31:31,083
Work's been pretty awful
without you there.

1251
01:31:31,166 --> 01:31:33,250
We were like partners.

1252
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:34,750
I know.

1253
01:31:35,666 --> 01:31:37,375
And, like, the worst part is

1254
01:31:37,458 --> 01:31:39,416
that everyone is just, you know,

1255
01:31:40,208 --> 01:31:42,041
talking shit about you all the time.

1256
01:31:43,416 --> 01:31:45,333
I guessed they would. Yeah.

1257
01:31:45,416 --> 01:31:48,541
It makes me mad 'cause you're not there
to defend yourself, and so…

1258
01:31:48,625 --> 01:31:52,458
You know, I'm going to town on everyone,
and Sandra, she--

1259
01:31:52,541 --> 01:31:53,583
Oh God!

1260
01:31:53,666 --> 01:31:55,333
-Oh, she got an earful.

1261
01:31:55,416 --> 01:31:57,625
Now they'll be talking shit about me.

1262
01:32:00,375 --> 01:32:02,791
I don't wanna talk about Parkfield. It's…

1263
01:32:07,833 --> 01:32:08,708
Why not?

1264
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:21,541
Is it because

1265
01:32:23,166 --> 01:32:24,916
what they're saying's true?

1266
01:32:27,291 --> 01:32:28,416
'Cause, you know, um…

1267
01:32:29,666 --> 01:32:32,041
I wouldn't care if you did those things.

1268
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,583
I mean, I could understand.

1269
01:32:45,083 --> 01:32:47,500
-You could explain it--

1270
01:33:27,541 --> 01:33:30,000
I didn't tell you.
I got permission to see my girls.

1271
01:33:31,416 --> 01:33:33,750
Two days every second week.

1272
01:33:34,666 --> 01:33:36,333
I was thinking…
I don't know, I was thinking

1273
01:33:36,416 --> 01:33:39,625
that maybe you and Maya and Alex
and then me and my girls,

1274
01:33:39,708 --> 01:33:41,625
we could go on a day trip or something.

1275
01:33:49,416 --> 01:33:51,416
I wanna talk about Parkfield.

1276
01:33:54,708 --> 01:33:56,666
I wanna talk about what you did.

1277
01:34:22,416 --> 01:34:27,916
<i>♪ That love will sometimes bring</i>

1278
01:34:30,583 --> 01:34:31,708
I gotta go.

1279
01:34:32,666 --> 01:34:35,750
I'm starting a new job. Can't be late, so…

1280
01:34:35,833 --> 01:34:37,291
But I'll call soon.

1281
01:34:42,625 --> 01:34:45,916
He's leaving. You guys, he's leaving.
He's walking out right now.

1282
01:34:46,666 --> 01:34:48,250
What…

1283
01:35:05,458 --> 01:35:06,500
Are you okay?

1284
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:12,500
Where's Elmsworth?
Amy, where's Elmsworth Hospital?

1285
01:35:15,291 --> 01:35:17,000
Thirty miles away in Pennsylvania.

1286
01:35:19,541 --> 01:35:20,833
I'm gonna call Ellis.

1287
01:35:21,666 --> 01:35:23,250
I pushed him too hard.

1288
01:35:24,583 --> 01:35:26,250
You did great, Amy.

1289
01:35:30,833 --> 01:35:33,666
We're good. They're gonna pick him up.

1290
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:35,500
-All right.
-Bring him in.

1291
01:35:36,291 --> 01:35:38,833
We can only hold him for 48 hours.

1292
01:36:07,875 --> 01:36:09,708
-And talk to the people.

1293
01:36:09,791 --> 01:36:13,208
And I'm gonna make sure
there's something in my mind that…

1294
01:36:50,375 --> 01:36:51,958
Show me your hands.

1295
01:36:52,041 --> 01:36:53,166
Open the door.

1296
01:36:54,083 --> 01:36:55,666
Slowly. Open the door.

1297
01:37:00,333 --> 01:37:03,125
You're under arrest.
Get out of the vehicle. Slowly.

1298
01:37:03,208 --> 01:37:04,500
Get down on the ground.

1299
01:37:08,958 --> 01:37:10,625
Put this hand behind your back.

1300
01:37:11,833 --> 01:37:16,291
Put this other hand behind your back.
Stay right there. Do not move.

1301
01:38:03,875 --> 01:38:07,291
My name is Detective Sergeant Tim Braun.
With me is Detective Dan Baldwin.

1302
01:38:07,375 --> 01:38:09,958
Today is Saturday, December 13, 2003.

1303
01:38:10,041 --> 01:38:13,666
The time is approximately 8:14 p.m.

1304
01:38:14,208 --> 01:38:16,958
We're in the Major Crimes interview room
with Mr. Charles Cullen.

1305
01:38:17,041 --> 01:38:19,958
Mr. Cullen, for the record,
could you please state your full name?

1306
01:38:20,625 --> 01:38:22,416
Uh, Charles Cullen.

1307
01:38:23,250 --> 01:38:24,791
Could you spell that, please?

1308
01:38:24,875 --> 01:38:27,958
Uh, C-H-A-R-L-E-S

1309
01:38:28,041 --> 01:38:29,833
C-U-L-L-E-N.

1310
01:38:29,916 --> 01:38:31,750
Is it okay if we call you Charlie, then?

1311
01:38:32,583 --> 01:38:33,416
Yeah.

1312
01:38:34,458 --> 01:38:35,541
Okay.

1313
01:38:44,916 --> 01:38:46,250
Okay, Charlie.

1314
01:38:50,333 --> 01:38:52,541
Is there anything
you wanna tell us, Charlie?

1315
01:38:54,166 --> 01:38:55,708
Um…

1316
01:38:59,250 --> 01:39:02,333
I mean, uh… I don't think so, no.

1317
01:39:03,125 --> 01:39:07,333
How many IV bags have you polluted
at Parkfield Memorial Hospital?

1318
01:39:14,916 --> 01:39:16,916
We know you killed Kelly Anderson.

1319
01:39:18,166 --> 01:39:20,750
We know you killed Ana Martinez.
We know there's others.

1320
01:39:22,708 --> 01:39:25,125
We just wanna talk about it
with you, Charlie.

1321
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,041
I can't. I'm not meant
to talk about patients

1322
01:39:29,125 --> 01:39:30,833
without the hospital lawyers.

1323
01:39:30,916 --> 01:39:33,541
You don't work there anymore.
You can say whatever you want.

1324
01:39:33,625 --> 01:39:35,416
You're free to talk here.

1325
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:37,916
I can't, so…

1326
01:39:39,666 --> 01:39:40,791
Why'd you kill 'em?

1327
01:39:43,833 --> 01:39:46,041
Was it just women, Charlie?

1328
01:39:47,708 --> 01:39:49,916
They remind you of your ex-wife maybe?

1329
01:39:50,416 --> 01:39:52,416
You know, that I could understand.

1330
01:39:55,041 --> 01:39:56,250
Or your mother?

1331
01:40:04,250 --> 01:40:05,375
I can't.

1332
01:40:06,458 --> 01:40:07,583
I can't.

1333
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,833
You know, the… the saline-bag stuff,

1334
01:40:15,125 --> 01:40:17,000
that was… was pretty smart.

1335
01:40:17,791 --> 01:40:19,791
That was very smart, Charlie.

1336
01:40:21,875 --> 01:40:24,208
You know, I never seen anything like that.

1337
01:40:24,791 --> 01:40:26,458
How'd you come up with that?

1338
01:40:32,666 --> 01:40:34,708
How many have you killed,
Charlie?

1339
01:40:36,625 --> 01:40:38,458
Ten, 11?

1340
01:40:43,958 --> 01:40:46,000
Hey, Charlie, stick with me here, okay?

1341
01:40:48,375 --> 01:40:50,208
Come on back, Charlie.

1342
01:40:50,291 --> 01:40:53,166
Just gotta have this conversation, okay?
I know you can do it.

1343
01:40:56,208 --> 01:40:57,666
I can't…

1344
01:40:57,750 --> 01:41:00,000
Charlie, can you look at me, please?

1345
01:41:00,625 --> 01:41:02,291
Mm… I can't.

1346
01:41:02,375 --> 01:41:03,833
-Come on, Charlie.
-I can't.

1347
01:41:04,333 --> 01:41:07,291
You can. You gotta do this.
I know you can.

1348
01:41:09,458 --> 01:41:10,875
-Hey--

1349
01:41:11,375 --> 01:41:12,958
I can't. I can't.

1350
01:41:13,916 --> 01:41:16,208
I can't. I can't.

1351
01:41:16,291 --> 01:41:18,333
I can't. I can't.

1352
01:41:18,416 --> 01:41:19,416
-Charlie.

1353
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:21,250
-Charlie.
-I can't.

1354
01:41:21,333 --> 01:41:22,750
-I can't.
-Charlie, you can.

1355
01:41:23,583 --> 01:41:25,750
I can't, I can't, I can't.

1356
01:41:25,833 --> 01:41:27,000
I can't, I can't.

1357
01:41:27,083 --> 01:41:28,458
Charlie!

1358
01:41:47,041 --> 01:41:47,958
All right.

1359
01:41:49,291 --> 01:41:51,666
We've seen your Cerner,
we've seen your PYXIS,

1360
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:53,791
we've seen your orders,
we've seen the cancellations.

1361
01:41:53,875 --> 01:41:55,041
We know all about it.

1362
01:41:55,541 --> 01:41:58,458
We know how you poisoned the bags
in the storeroom,

1363
01:41:58,541 --> 01:42:00,041
had the other nurses hang 'em up.

1364
01:42:02,791 --> 01:42:05,458
You know what?
I don't think you picked Kelly, did you?

1365
01:42:07,208 --> 01:42:08,500
Did you?

1366
01:42:08,583 --> 01:42:10,916
You know
what I've been wondering?

1367
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,458
Now, I got no judgment. Charlie. Listen.

1368
01:42:13,541 --> 01:42:14,875
-I can't.
-Hey.

1369
01:42:14,958 --> 01:42:15,791
I can't.

1370
01:42:15,875 --> 01:42:18,583
-You can, Charlie. Yes, you can.
-I can't.

1371
01:42:19,333 --> 01:42:20,291
I can't.

1372
01:42:21,041 --> 01:42:21,875
I can't.

1373
01:42:21,958 --> 01:42:22,833
-Hey.
-I can't.

1374
01:42:22,916 --> 01:42:23,791
-Hey.
-I can't.

1375
01:42:23,875 --> 01:42:26,750
Hey, enough of this shit!
Enough of this shit, Charlie!

1376
01:42:26,833 --> 01:42:29,333
I can't! I can't! I can't!

1377
01:42:29,416 --> 01:42:32,125
I can't! I can't! I can't!

1378
01:42:32,208 --> 01:42:35,500
I can't! I can't! I can't! I can't!

1379
01:42:35,583 --> 01:42:38,250
I can't! I can't! I can't!

1380
01:42:38,333 --> 01:42:41,666
I can't! I can't! I can't!

1381
01:42:42,916 --> 01:42:44,791
I can't!

1382
01:44:03,583 --> 01:44:04,833
-Hey.
-Hi.

1383
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:08,416
What happened?

1384
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:09,875
We're not gonna get it.

1385
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:12,791
He's not gonna break.
He's not gonna confess.

1386
01:44:18,625 --> 01:44:20,708
We have to release him tomorrow morning.

1387
01:44:29,250 --> 01:44:30,291
I'm sorry.

1388
01:44:37,083 --> 01:44:40,541
<i>What's something a pet hamster</i>
<i>spends a lot of time doing?</i>

1389
01:44:40,625 --> 01:44:43,333
<i>A pet hamster</i>
<i>spends a lot of time in the cage.</i>

1390
01:44:44,250 --> 01:44:45,500
-<i>In the cage?</i>
-<i>Yes!</i>

1391
01:44:48,458 --> 01:44:49,583
<i>In the cage!</i>

1392
01:44:51,666 --> 01:44:52,958
<i>Oh no!</i>

1393
01:45:39,666 --> 01:45:41,166
<i>You sure you're up for this?</i>

1394
01:45:44,875 --> 01:45:45,791
Yeah.

1395
01:45:47,291 --> 01:45:49,083
Remember, you can't touch him.

1396
01:45:51,291 --> 01:45:53,041
You can't even get close to him.

1397
01:45:57,333 --> 01:45:58,833
He was my friend.

1398
01:46:00,791 --> 01:46:02,208
I just need to see him.

1399
01:46:40,750 --> 01:46:41,791
Hi, Charlie.

1400
01:46:46,083 --> 01:46:48,416
Can you take his handcuffs off please?

1401
01:46:51,250 --> 01:46:52,291
Please?

1402
01:47:32,750 --> 01:47:33,916
Are you okay?

1403
01:47:41,041 --> 01:47:41,875
Um…

1404
01:47:44,125 --> 01:47:45,333
Go away, Amy.

1405
01:47:47,375 --> 01:47:48,250
You cold?

1406
01:47:50,250 --> 01:47:51,833
Look, you're freezing. Here.

1407
01:47:52,333 --> 01:47:54,416
I'm just gonna put this
over your shoulders.

1408
01:48:09,916 --> 01:48:11,000
There you go.

1409
01:48:14,958 --> 01:48:17,666
I really needed you
these few months, you know?

1410
01:48:27,583 --> 01:48:28,916
And then all this.

1411
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:35,750
It made me…

1412
01:48:38,666 --> 01:48:40,333
forget who you were to me.

1413
01:48:44,333 --> 01:48:48,208
Forget what you did for me, and…

1414
01:48:54,666 --> 01:48:56,583
I forgot about your goodness.

1415
01:49:21,458 --> 01:49:23,125
I'll never understand.

1416
01:49:26,166 --> 01:49:27,333
Not how you,

1417
01:49:28,333 --> 01:49:32,500
who is so kind and generous…

1418
01:49:35,041 --> 01:49:36,583
how you could hurt people.

1419
01:49:42,125 --> 01:49:43,583
And I'm so sorry

1420
01:49:45,208 --> 01:49:49,791
that I lied to you
and went behind your back.

1421
01:49:52,250 --> 01:49:54,875
That must make you feel even more alone.

1422
01:50:19,041 --> 01:50:21,083
Hey. Hey.

1423
01:50:32,958 --> 01:50:34,500
All… You know, I never had…

1424
01:50:34,583 --> 01:50:37,000
You know,
I always just wanted to help you.

1425
01:50:38,083 --> 01:50:39,125
I know.

1426
01:50:41,250 --> 01:50:42,375
I know that.

1427
01:50:46,750 --> 01:50:48,458
And I still need you.

1428
01:51:00,291 --> 01:51:01,833
What do you need me to do?

1429
01:51:07,666 --> 01:51:08,958
Tell the truth.

1430
01:51:23,125 --> 01:51:24,375
I just did it.

1431
01:51:35,041 --> 01:51:36,166
I just did it.

1432
01:51:48,250 --> 01:51:51,291
I'm sorry. I'm gonna need more than that.

1433
01:51:54,708 --> 01:51:56,208
What do you want me to tell you?

1434
01:52:00,375 --> 01:52:01,375
Names.

1435
01:52:02,333 --> 01:52:04,000
I can't remember all the names.

1436
01:52:05,958 --> 01:52:07,916
Just tell me what you can remember.

1437
01:52:15,791 --> 01:52:17,416
Douglas Stevenson.

1438
01:52:24,333 --> 01:52:26,083
Ana Martinez.

1439
01:52:29,125 --> 01:52:30,541
Kelly Anderson.

1440
01:52:34,625 --> 01:52:36,208
And there… there was…

1441
01:52:37,666 --> 01:52:38,583
Uh…

1442
01:52:39,166 --> 01:52:42,333
I can't remember his name.
He was younger. Um…

1443
01:52:43,666 --> 01:52:45,333
-Jack Ivins?
-Yeah. Jack.

1444
01:52:47,041 --> 01:52:48,083
Jack. Yep.

1445
01:52:49,041 --> 01:52:50,833
And then there… there was a…

1446
01:52:51,833 --> 01:52:54,333
There was a… a man at my last hospital,

1447
01:52:54,416 --> 01:52:56,875
uh, he had a German name. I can't…

1448
01:53:02,291 --> 01:53:03,291
Why?

1449
01:53:14,791 --> 01:53:16,291
They didn't stop me.

1450
01:55:25,583 --> 01:55:26,666
Mm.

1451
01:55:30,708 --> 01:55:31,833
Mm.

1452
01:55:35,666 --> 01:55:38,375
We have to get up.
It's a school day.

1453
01:55:41,625 --> 01:55:42,875
Not today.

1454
01:55:45,041 --> 01:55:46,750
Today we stay in bed.
