1
00:00:03,548 --> 00:00:05,015
Who are these people?

2
00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:07,485
Raylan, who... who's out there?

3
00:00:07,552 --> 00:00:10,221
Miami gun
thugs, I suspect.

4
00:00:10,341 --> 00:00:13,057
What do they want?

5
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:14,191
Me.

6
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:17,161
Is my daddy moving?

7
00:00:17,229 --> 00:00:19,163
No.

8
00:00:29,474 --> 00:00:32,710
You didn't happen to bring
your rocket launcher, did you?

9
00:00:32,778 --> 00:00:34,545
I didn't think to pack one.

10
00:00:34,613 --> 00:00:36,614
All we want is Raylan Givens!

11
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:43,850
How about I come out unarmed
and you come out unarmed and we talk?

12
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,992
The second he clears, you
shoot him in the gut.

13
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,761
Maybe we can get him
to Gio before he dies.

14
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:51,562
Gotcha.

15
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,697
Why don't we all just run?

16
00:00:53,765 --> 00:00:55,933
Well, someone's got to keep them
here for the other two to have a chance.

17
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:57,201
I'll stay, then.

18
00:00:57,269 --> 00:01:01,789
Boyd, I'm asking you...
Take Ava out of here.

19
00:01:04,336 --> 00:01:05,383
Come on.

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,947
My hands are empty.

21
00:01:17,528 --> 00:01:19,757
Me too.

22
00:01:19,825 --> 00:01:21,759
Where's your friend?

23
00:01:45,283 --> 00:01:46,283
Is he dead?

24
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:48,020
Yeah, I think so.

25
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:48,904
Where's Ava?

26
00:01:49,024 --> 00:01:50,521
She's running
through the woods.

27
00:01:50,965 --> 00:01:52,005
Where you going?

28
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,525
I'm going after the young
lady with the automatic weapon.

29
00:01:54,593 --> 00:01:56,527
I'll get her.

30
00:02:04,803 --> 00:02:06,804
What are you gonna
do after you get her?

31
00:02:06,872 --> 00:02:09,573
I ain't quite
figured that out yet.

32
00:02:09,641 --> 00:02:11,141
You gonna shoot to stop me?

33
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:12,243
Maybe.

34
00:02:12,344 --> 00:02:14,608
I'm pretty
sure you're empty.

35
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,948
You gonna bet
your life on that?

36
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:20,851
No, Raylan, I'm gonna
bet my life on you being the

37
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:23,571
only friend I have
left in this world.

38
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,924
♪

39
00:02:57,485 --> 00:02:59,198
Where's your boyfriend?

40
00:02:59,452 --> 00:03:00,697
Which one?

41
00:03:25,283 --> 00:03:26,116
Holy shit.

42
00:03:26,184 --> 00:03:27,518
Where you headed?

43
00:03:27,585 --> 00:03:29,486
C-cincy.

44
00:03:29,554 --> 00:03:31,488
Not anymore.

45
00:03:43,668 --> 00:03:46,070
You going to kill me?

46
00:03:46,137 --> 00:03:48,739
Do I have to?

47
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:50,641
No.

48
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:52,609
What's that?

49
00:03:55,747 --> 00:03:57,088
Aah!

50
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:09,193
Boyd!

51
00:04:10,197 --> 00:04:13,530
How long you
been following me?

52
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:15,666
Truck stop.

53
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:17,568
I'll take it from here, all right?

54
00:04:17,635 --> 00:04:19,970
I believe I got
it from here, Raylan.

55
00:04:20,038 --> 00:04:21,930
You just
gonna execute her?

56
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,675
I wouldn't call
it an execution.

57
00:04:24,743 --> 00:04:27,311
More like retribution...
She killed my daddy.

58
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:29,501
Which is what
you wanted to do.

59
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:35,152
And besides, the gun thug behind the
tree killed your daddy, and I got him.

60
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,335
Are you gonna
split hairs with me?

61
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:39,523
I'm just saying.

62
00:04:39,591 --> 00:04:43,660
Well, what's to stop me from
pulling this trigger, Raylan?

63
00:04:43,728 --> 00:04:45,329
That it would be a sin?

64
00:04:45,397 --> 00:04:46,997
Don't get me wrong.

65
00:04:47,065 --> 00:04:49,533
I have no moral objection
to you killing her.

66
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:52,603
You understand, miss,
the life you've led.

67
00:04:53,704 --> 00:04:56,294
But I need her... alive.

68
00:04:56,414 --> 00:04:58,218
And if I don't comply?

69
00:04:59,744 --> 00:05:00,370
Aah!

70
00:05:06,651 --> 00:05:08,581
Aah!

71
00:05:10,835 --> 00:05:13,071
Boyd, nice shot.

72
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,957
- Can you get my friend to a hospital?
He's been shot. Let's go. - Will do.

73
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,287
What do you need?

74
00:05:56,301 --> 00:05:57,643
My God, she needs a doctor.

75
00:05:57,763 --> 00:06:00,237
She's needed one for a
while, but I don't think these

76
00:06:00,305 --> 00:06:01,939
next two minutes are
gonna kill her.

77
00:06:02,006 --> 00:06:03,073
What do you want?

78
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:07,411
What I did, the way I
killed your man, Tommy Bucks,

79
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:10,981
I understand you feel like
you need to come after me.

80
00:06:11,049 --> 00:06:13,984
Trouble is, there are people I
care about

81
00:06:14,052 --> 00:06:15,233
that are getting caught in the crossfire.

82
00:06:15,353 --> 00:06:18,763
So this ends right
here, right now.

83
00:06:30,735 --> 00:06:33,504
What would you give me in return?

84
00:06:33,571 --> 00:06:36,507
You leave me alone,
and we will leave her alone.

85
00:06:36,574 --> 00:06:38,542
You have my word.

86
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,844
I need more.

87
00:06:40,912 --> 00:06:45,287
Well, I'd give you more, but
everyone else you've sent my way is dead.

88
00:06:47,385 --> 00:06:48,519
Let's go, Gio.

89
00:06:48,586 --> 00:06:49,830
She needs a doctor.

90
00:06:51,075 --> 00:06:53,724
I need guarantees
about my business.

91
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,025
All right, look.

92
00:06:55,093 --> 00:06:56,360
I've tried to be reasonable.

93
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:59,496
You give me your word in 10 seconds,
or I shoot you in the head.

94
00:07:03,134 --> 00:07:05,789
Just...Time-out.

95
00:07:09,607 --> 00:07:10,574
Maybe I should...?

96
00:07:10,642 --> 00:07:12,754
Just let it ring.

97
00:07:13,745 --> 00:07:15,752
We can't get to the
phone right now.

98
00:07:15,872 --> 00:07:17,481
Leave a message. Bye!

99
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:20,177
Raylan, I'm walking in.

100
00:07:20,297 --> 00:07:22,920
Whatever you're thinking
about doing, don't.

101
00:07:22,987 --> 00:07:25,875
Mr. Reyes, my name's Dan Grant.

102
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:28,604
I am the Chief Deputy
of the Miami Marshals office.

103
00:07:28,724 --> 00:07:31,955
There's an ambulance on the way
for your niece.

104
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:34,589
'Til it gets here we're gonna talk.

105
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:39,281
The three of us, like civilized men
see if we can't work something out, ok?

106
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:42,101
- Ok, let's talk.
- Not here.

107
00:07:43,034 --> 00:07:44,934
The kitchen then, I could use a drink.

108
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,842
Not the kitchen.

109
00:07:49,192 --> 00:07:49,984
In the den?

110
00:07:50,423 --> 00:07:51,541
No,

111
00:07:51,852 --> 00:07:53,366
and not the master bedroom,

112
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:55,163
not your office...

113
00:07:57,502 --> 00:07:58,614
This far enough?

114
00:07:58,734 --> 00:07:59,710
A little further.

115
00:08:04,796 --> 00:08:05,892
Okay.

116
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,397
Here's what I'm thinking.

117
00:08:07,465 --> 00:08:09,333
See if this makes sense.

118
00:08:10,116 --> 00:08:13,343
You come after Raylan, harm him
in any way,

119
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:16,696
I'll kill you myself.

120
00:08:26,217 --> 00:08:27,317
Go ahead. Say it.

121
00:08:27,352 --> 00:08:28,652
I thought that went well.

122
00:08:29,487 --> 00:08:30,531
Okay.

123
00:08:30,651 --> 00:08:31,388
Get 'em up.

124
00:08:31,456 --> 00:08:32,956
So, Art called you?

125
00:08:33,024 --> 00:08:33,824
Yeah.

126
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:34,725
You want to stay?

127
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:35,259
Hmm?

128
00:08:35,326 --> 00:08:35,959
You want to stay?

129
00:08:36,027 --> 00:08:38,428
The AUSA has long forgotten
about Tommy Bucks.

130
00:08:38,496 --> 00:08:39,463
O'Neill's retired.

131
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,578
I got a slot open.

132
00:08:40,698 --> 00:08:42,340
I didn't
think you missed me.

133
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,915
Well, you know, I had a wart once,
when I was a kid...

134
00:08:45,035 --> 00:08:47,027
Right. And when it was gone,
you missed it?

135
00:08:47,147 --> 00:08:48,605
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I get it.

136
00:08:48,673 --> 00:08:50,307
Wait. Hold up.

137
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,409
Is this your idea, or
did Art suggest this?

138
00:08:52,477 --> 00:08:53,477
Suggest what?

139
00:08:53,544 --> 00:08:54,778
Shit.

140
00:08:54,846 --> 00:08:55,512
He did.

141
00:08:56,618 --> 00:08:57,736
I owe him one.

142
00:08:57,856 --> 00:08:58,682
What for?

143
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,917
Well, he took you
off my hands, didn't he?

144
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:02,586
Dan, I went to Kentucky.

145
00:09:02,654 --> 00:09:05,377
I did my job, and, as far as
I'm concerned, I did it well.

146
00:09:05,497 --> 00:09:06,323
What's your point?

147
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:08,859
My point is, this
trouble I'm in is bullshit.

148
00:09:08,926 --> 00:09:09,967
I don't understand.

149
00:09:10,087 --> 00:09:11,361
I don't know
why they give us guns.

150
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:12,056
Raylan...

151
00:09:13,683 --> 00:09:15,346
I'm trying to
offer you your old job back.

152
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:17,100
I thought that's what you wanted.

153
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:20,404
Right now, I just want
to go home and go to bed.

Disappointed?

164
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,915
Dan says the cartel's

Well, I'm still gonna
sit facing the door.

167
00:10:51,013 --> 00:10:52,407
What about Boyd?

168
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:53,319
What about him?

169
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:56,631
He agree to that... Not gonna
run out and avenge his daddy?

170
00:10:57,165 --> 00:10:59,570
Well, I figured I'd talk
to him tomorrow at the hospital.

171
00:10:59,637 --> 00:11:01,438
Well, you're a
little late for that.

172
00:11:01,506 --> 00:11:03,140
Slipped out in the
middle of the night.

173
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,006
Well, that's good news.

174
00:11:06,126 --> 00:11:07,421
He must be feeling better.

175
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:11,308
So...You want to transfer me.

176
00:11:12,717 --> 00:11:15,586
Honestly, Raylan, I don't
know who would take you.

177
00:11:15,653 --> 00:11:17,487
Everything I
did, I saw no choice.

178
00:11:17,555 --> 00:11:19,289
You should have
called for backup.

179
00:11:19,357 --> 00:11:22,659
Bo said if he saw
anyone but me, he'd kill Ava.

180
00:11:22,727 --> 00:11:24,953
And so you took Boyd?

181
00:11:27,332 --> 00:11:29,566
It made sense at the time.

182
00:11:31,671 --> 00:11:33,496
Well, you know what
happens now, don't ya?

183
00:11:33,616 --> 00:11:36,610
We get legions of AUSAs all up in our ass.

184
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,828
Tim!

185
00:11:40,896 --> 00:11:43,113
We're gonna do the gun thing.

186
00:11:43,181 --> 00:11:46,016
Relinquishing a firearm can
be a very emotional moment,

187
00:11:46,084 --> 00:11:48,332
and there always must be
another deputy in attendance.

188
00:11:48,452 --> 00:11:51,630
Add in some premium alcohol,
what could possibly go wrong?

189
00:11:55,693 --> 00:11:56,627
Thank you.

190
00:11:56,694 --> 00:11:58,034
Mm-hmm.

191
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:03,361
What are you
going to get next?

192
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:06,545
Probably the same thing.

193
00:12:06,665 --> 00:12:08,455
You should
think about an uzi.

194
00:12:09,545 --> 00:12:12,276
♪

195
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:48,733
How'd your father get that bullet
in his arm... in the motel?

196
00:12:48,853 --> 00:12:51,307
Um...
I don't clearly recall.

197
00:12:51,427 --> 00:12:53,274
A lot seemed to happen at once.

198
00:12:53,394 --> 00:12:55,152
What did Arlo say?

199
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,901
Your father said you shot him by accident
when the bad guys started shooting.

200
00:13:01,426 --> 00:13:03,140
He should know.

201
00:13:05,824 --> 00:13:08,442
We're looking for the $20000 that
the Marshal service

202
00:13:08,562 --> 00:13:10,932
- gave to your father to give to Bo Crowder
- Mm-hmm.

203
00:13:11,052 --> 00:13:14,380
Your father said he passed it on, but we
didn't find it in Crowders things.

204
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,908
Arlo has it.

205
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,422
You know this?

206
00:13:17,818 --> 00:13:19,219
I know Arlo.

207
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,278
What, you guys think I stole it?

208
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:32,116
Just cause I've shot the occasional
person, doesn't make me a thief.

209
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:40,877
Hey, Harlan man.

210
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,890
- You think you might be interested
in possibly..? - Yes.

211
00:13:47,122 --> 00:13:49,346
- You don't even know what I was gonna ask.

212
00:13:50,221 --> 00:13:51,778
Is it gonna get me out of here?

213
00:13:58,449 --> 00:14:01,251
So, who we going after?

214
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:02,786
Jimmy Earl Dean.

215
00:14:02,854 --> 00:14:06,323
Three first names...
triple winner right off the bat.

216
00:14:06,391 --> 00:14:08,792
Sex offender...
statutory rape.

217
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,560
Got his release two weeks ago.

218
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:13,374
State police got a
call on the tip line.

219
00:14:13,494 --> 00:14:17,000
Man matching his description was
aggravating a teenage girl.

220
00:14:17,068 --> 00:14:19,166
Why'd you ask
me to go with you?

221
00:14:20,581 --> 00:14:24,474
I'm not...
Comfortable with these people.

222
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:26,743
What people?

223
00:14:26,811 --> 00:14:27,859
Perverts?

224
00:14:30,815 --> 00:14:32,182
People in Harlan.

225
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,077
Anytime I've gone to coal country,
everyone was all polite...

226
00:14:35,197 --> 00:14:36,953
- I'd prefer to do paperwork.
- ..."Yes, ma'am. No, ma'am."

227
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:40,624
Trying to keep in mind it's the
21st century and what's expected.

228
00:14:41,427 --> 00:14:45,729
But when the cuffs come out...
Then I'm a black bitch.

229
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:49,332
So you want me to
help you with my people.

230
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,036
You know, throw 'em a pork
rind or some ding dongs?

231
00:14:53,104 --> 00:14:55,014
If you wouldn't mind.

232
00:14:56,908 --> 00:14:58,842
No, ma'am.

233
00:15:05,817 --> 00:15:09,345
Hey...
You can't take those.

234
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:14,224
My daddy told you two
days ago to stay away from me.

235
00:15:15,496 --> 00:15:18,228
I told him about you
creeping up again yesterday.

236
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:20,163
You see me coming near you?

237
00:15:20,231 --> 00:15:22,065
Mnh-mnh.

238
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:24,534
I'm way over here, and I'm
gonna stay over here.

239
00:15:24,602 --> 00:15:25,720
But you stop harvesting.

240
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,930
Why should I?

241
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,996
This is my daddy's weed
and my daddy's shed.

242
00:15:29,116 --> 00:15:29,916
You're trespassing.

243
00:15:30,036 --> 00:15:31,317
I don't care
whose shed it is.

244
00:15:31,437 --> 00:15:32,576
That's not your weed.

245
00:15:32,643 --> 00:15:33,777
Not yours, either.

246
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:35,612
It belongs to
the folks I work for.

247
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,547
Oh, really?

248
00:15:37,615 --> 00:15:38,816
They didn't grow it.

249
00:15:38,936 --> 00:15:39,883
Grown on their land.

250
00:15:39,951 --> 00:15:41,351
Grown on state land.

251
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:43,253
Oh, you gonna
be a lawyer now?

252
00:15:44,302 --> 00:15:46,189
Is this how come
you been perving on me?

253
00:15:46,257 --> 00:15:48,429
Now, how have I
been perving on you?

254
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:50,293
Have I exposed myself?

255
00:15:50,361 --> 00:15:52,762
Have I made any lewd or
unwanted comments toward you?

256
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:53,563
No, I have not.

257
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:55,599
Well, right now you're
talking to a 14-year-old

258
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,100
girl you have no reason
to be talking to.

259
00:15:57,168 --> 00:15:59,163
I have a reason
to be talking to you.

260
00:15:59,283 --> 00:16:00,637
You're trying to steal
something don't belong to you.

261
00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:02,314
Hey!
I told you to stay back.

262
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,656
Yes, ma'am. Okay.

263
00:16:05,982 --> 00:16:06,689
Wow.

264
00:16:09,123 --> 00:16:10,354
Where's your mama?

265
00:16:10,681 --> 00:16:11,793
Hmm?

266
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:18,632
Did she die, or did she run off?

267
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:22,050
You miss your mama?

268
00:16:23,471 --> 00:16:25,552
At your age, I imagine you do.

269
00:16:26,464 --> 00:16:31,735
I mean, a girl your age, she
needs somebody to talk to.

270
00:16:31,802 --> 00:16:34,905
It's not like your daddy
could do a good job of that.

271
00:16:34,972 --> 00:16:38,441
It's not like you could talk
to him about your period.

272
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:41,778
You gonna be the one
to talk to me about that?

273
00:16:41,846 --> 00:16:43,513
Well, I'm closer in age.

274
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:44,681
Not by much.

275
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:45,882
Oh, come on.

276
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:46,850
I just turned 30.

277
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:50,587
Any man over 18 talking to
me about my period is a pervert.

278
00:16:50,655 --> 00:16:53,723
Shit, any man period talking
to me about my period.

279
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,227
Period... That's funny.

280
00:16:57,295 --> 00:16:58,361
You're very funny.

281
00:16:58,429 --> 00:16:59,529
That's good stuff.

282
00:16:59,597 --> 00:17:04,100
Is this gonna be your new line...
How we got the same sense of humor?

283
00:17:05,242 --> 00:17:06,579
What's in your mind?

284
00:17:07,386 --> 00:17:09,873
How do you think this is gonna go?

285
00:17:09,941 --> 00:17:12,809
You thinking, "maybe we'll fight
a little, then it'll turn to

286
00:17:12,877 --> 00:17:15,445
wrestling and tickling and
laughing, then she'll say,

287
00:17:15,513 --> 00:17:18,777
'ooh, don't touch me there,'
and then she won't stop me"?

288
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:22,688
Is that how it runs in your head?

289
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:28,225
You don't even know what
to say now, do you?

290
00:17:29,227 --> 00:17:32,229
Even me talking about wrestling
and tickling and "ooh, don't

291
00:17:32,296 --> 00:17:36,228
touch me there," it's like a spell's
been cast, and you won't break it.

292
00:17:37,117 --> 00:17:40,018
Well, maybe you're just dreaming
and you don't wanna wake up.

293
00:17:41,489 --> 00:17:43,032
Well, wake up!

294
00:17:43,427 --> 00:17:44,666
God damn it!

295
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,615
I tried nice with you...

296
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:52,974
hell I tried friendly.

297
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,634
It ain't worked yet.

298
00:17:56,603 --> 00:17:59,094
You know when people ask me
why I came back here to Harlan,

299
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:02,981
I tell 'em it's cause
the Bennett boys gave me a job.

300
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,281
But honestly,

301
00:18:07,391 --> 00:18:08,585
that's not it.

302
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:11,653
That's not it at all.

303
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,750
I came back here because of you Loretta.

304
00:18:27,602 --> 00:18:28,950
Aah!

305
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:38,070
He works for them?

306
00:18:39,712 --> 00:18:43,012
When he came by here, he just
said he was some bank man.

307
00:18:43,734 --> 00:18:45,602
Well, he
followed me to the shed.

308
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,399
Oh, Jesus.

309
00:18:47,924 --> 00:18:49,154
What's wrong?

310
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:52,394
I called that tip
line this morning.

311
00:18:52,462 --> 00:18:54,797
Oh, daddy, I
told you not to do that.

312
00:18:54,864 --> 00:18:56,298
Don't worry.
It's anonymous.

313
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:02,189
Well, I'll go talk to Mags,
she likes me.

314
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:03,567
Rettie.

315
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,872
When you talk to her, don't say anything
about us growing.

316
00:19:08,111 --> 00:19:10,980
Well, with the perv working
for her, she already knows, daddy.

317
00:19:25,462 --> 00:19:27,963
With our little convoy,
you listen closely enough, you

318
00:19:28,031 --> 00:19:30,065
could have heard toilets
flushing up and down this holler,

319
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:31,866
everybody dumping their stash.

320
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:37,340
Hey, you or any of your people
have any sightings of Boyd Crowder lately?

321
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,955
No, but we're
looking for him.

322
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:40,809
State police!

323
00:19:40,877 --> 00:19:42,144
Why are you
looking for him?

324
00:19:42,212 --> 00:19:44,113
Well, you took
out Bo Crowder.

325
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,757
Miami gun thugs flipped his switch.
I was just a spectator.

326
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,992
At any rate, Bo's gone.

327
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:51,737
Open up, McCready.
I saw you at the window.

328
00:19:52,141 --> 00:19:55,162
You think Boyd's gonna
try to fill his father's shoes,

329
00:19:55,282 --> 00:19:57,768
take his place as
the crime lord of Harlan?

330
00:19:57,888 --> 00:20:00,429
What's that old
saying from science class?

331
00:20:00,497 --> 00:20:03,106
Nature abhors a vacuum?

332
00:20:04,567 --> 00:20:05,401
What?

333
00:20:05,468 --> 00:20:07,195
Sir, I'm trooper Tom Bergen.

334
00:20:07,315 --> 00:20:09,997
These are deputy U.S.
Marshals Brooks and Givens.

335
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,175
They're on a detail, looking
for a sex offender.

336
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:13,435
Jimmy Earl Dean.

337
00:20:13,555 --> 00:20:15,738
Well, what business
is it of mine?

338
00:20:15,858 --> 00:20:18,732
Well, Mr. McCready,
you called the state tip line.

339
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:21,450
The hell I did!

340
00:20:21,518 --> 00:20:25,030
Sir, you might have thought it
was an anonymous call, but it's not.

341
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:27,854
When you call, your name
and your address pop up.

342
00:20:28,724 --> 00:20:30,762
On the recording you left,
you said that a man

343
00:20:30,882 --> 00:20:32,969
from Rabbit Holler was
bothering your daughter.

344
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:36,338
The fella we're looking for,
he's from Rabbit Holler.

345
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:41,648
Well, I didn't call any
line or make any recording.

346
00:20:42,002 --> 00:20:43,672
Is your
daughter home, sir?

347
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:44,821
No, ma'am.

348
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:47,425
But you do have a
daughter who's of the same age

349
00:20:47,545 --> 00:20:49,449
of the girl mentioned
on the tip line.

350
00:20:49,569 --> 00:20:50,949
Would you please leave?

351
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:54,216
Sir, you change your mind,
if you want to help us put away

352
00:20:54,284 --> 00:20:57,924
a known and dangerous sex offender,
you...give us a call.

353
00:21:01,157 --> 00:21:02,724
Why so scared?

354
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:06,588
Well, there's about 10 sets of
eyes that saw us roll up to his house.

355
00:21:07,352 --> 00:21:09,058
Does James
Earl Dean have a job?

356
00:21:09,178 --> 00:21:11,505
He put something
down on his registration.

357
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,366
Green Mountain ATV tours.

358
00:21:13,486 --> 00:21:15,228
Oh, shit!

359
00:21:15,497 --> 00:21:17,302
That's why McCready's so nervous.

360
00:21:17,713 --> 00:21:19,963
The guy who's perving on his daughter,
works for the Bennetts.

361
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,330
Who are the Bennetts?

362
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:27,363
Hold still, still...
Unless you want to bleed some more.

363
00:21:27,483 --> 00:21:28,439
I am holding still!

364
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,193
Well, hold stiller.

365
00:21:31,071 --> 00:21:32,660
Anybody want some cheese?

366
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,075
Ho-ho-ho!

367
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,257
Here. Now you can stick on the
band-aids yourself.

368
00:21:39,696 --> 00:21:41,117
I am gonna
teach them a lesson.

369
00:21:41,237 --> 00:21:44,386
Hey, Doyle and me, we're
gonna take care of McCready.

370
00:21:44,901 --> 00:21:45,801
All right.

371
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:47,548
Well, I'm gonna take
care of the girl.

372
00:21:48,304 --> 00:21:49,294
What? Loretta?
What for?

373
00:21:49,803 --> 00:21:53,624
Seems to me she showed craftiness
and guile protecting her stash.

374
00:21:53,744 --> 00:21:54,914
Well, it ain't your face.

375
00:21:55,034 --> 00:21:57,843
Did I not tell you that
there would be booby traps?

376
00:21:57,963 --> 00:22:00,682
Stop by the store, see
what kinda cheese mama got.

377
00:22:01,262 --> 00:22:03,809
How about you spending
the 10 minutes I'm gone

378
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:05,776
cleaning up this shithole?
Hmm?

379
00:22:05,896 --> 00:22:08,295
Maybe get it from hideous
to just plain awful.

380
00:22:14,164 --> 00:22:15,509
Hey, there, Walt!

381
00:22:17,023 --> 00:22:18,325
You know why we're here?

382
00:22:18,445 --> 00:22:19,670
No.

383
00:22:20,637 --> 00:22:21,670
Where's Loretta?

384
00:22:21,738 --> 00:22:23,972
Down at your mother's
store, getting some flour.

385
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,741
Let's take this inside.

386
00:22:25,808 --> 00:22:26,864
All right.

387
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:33,129
Look, Doyle, when I called that line,
I didn't know he worked for you.

388
00:22:33,249 --> 00:22:35,205
- I never would've...
- What the hell you talking about?

389
00:22:36,945 --> 00:22:38,219
Called what line?

390
00:22:38,502 --> 00:22:40,189
Huh?

391
00:22:40,256 --> 00:22:41,362
Why are you here?

392
00:22:42,592 --> 00:22:44,126
Aah!

393
00:22:44,861 --> 00:22:46,761
Ow!

394
00:22:48,105 --> 00:22:49,364
What the hell?!

395
00:22:49,432 --> 00:22:51,040
This is more
Dickie's business.

396
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,827
I'm just standing by, make sure
you don't do anything stupid.

397
00:22:53,947 --> 00:22:55,426
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

398
00:22:56,172 --> 00:22:58,224
You've been planting
on our land, Walt.

399
00:22:58,675 --> 00:23:00,008
It's state land!

400
00:23:00,076 --> 00:23:02,243
Oh, now, you've been
planting on our land,

401
00:23:02,363 --> 00:23:05,714
and any planting's by our say-so, and
you did not have our say-so.

402
00:23:05,782 --> 00:23:07,647
I was just trying
to make a living!

403
00:23:07,767 --> 00:23:10,152
Sally Ann's medical
about wiped me clean.

404
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:13,265
Find something else,
maybe even something lawful.

405
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:16,074
Hell, you could start
by selling that watch.

406
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:18,093
It ain't real gold!

407
00:23:18,161 --> 00:23:19,561
Sally Ann gave it to
me on my wedding.

408
00:23:19,681 --> 00:23:20,679
Walt!

409
00:23:21,497 --> 00:23:25,067
You gonna come after us, hmm?

410
00:23:25,134 --> 00:23:27,277
Maybe take a shot while
we're going to the car?

411
00:23:27,397 --> 00:23:28,536
I ain't stupid!

412
00:23:28,656 --> 00:23:31,338
Well, we're
just gonna make sure.

413
00:23:43,197 --> 00:23:44,909
Oh, c-come on, now!

414
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:47,740
Aah! Ow!

415
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,558
It's okay, Walt.

416
00:23:49,626 --> 00:23:50,592
Won't break the bone.

417
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,893
Hardly even break the skin.

418
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:54,643
It's so harmless, why
don't you put your foot in it?

419
00:23:57,318 --> 00:23:59,313
Come on, now, Walt.

420
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:01,126
Put your foot in.

421
00:24:01,435 --> 00:24:02,519
The hell I will!

422
00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:04,177
Put your foot in, Walt.

423
00:24:04,297 --> 00:24:06,919
I-I swear I won't
grow no more weed!

424
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,329
Where's that bud your
Loretta took from the shed?

425
00:24:10,013 --> 00:24:12,399
It's behind the stereo.

426
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,842
I wouldn't lie.

427
00:24:20,046 --> 00:24:21,715
What were you
talking about before?

428
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,017
Calling what line?

429
00:24:23,137 --> 00:24:24,206
Nothing.

430
00:24:26,951 --> 00:24:28,300
Put your foot in, Walt!

431
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,970
No!

432
00:24:44,147 --> 00:24:47,413
Put your foot in, Walt.

433
00:24:55,855 --> 00:24:57,363
He do anything to you?

434
00:24:58,686 --> 00:25:00,186
I got away
before he could.

435
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,996
Did you tell your daddy?

436
00:25:07,015 --> 00:25:08,628
I did.

437
00:25:10,482 --> 00:25:12,786
How is your daddy, Loretta?

438
00:25:13,776 --> 00:25:17,206
He still under the cloud
from your mother's passing?

439
00:25:19,072 --> 00:25:22,284
Some days.

440
00:25:22,352 --> 00:25:24,028
Some days or most days?

441
00:25:25,132 --> 00:25:26,788
He taking care of you?

442
00:25:27,198 --> 00:25:29,150
Keeping a proper home?

443
00:25:32,523 --> 00:25:34,490
He sits in his chair, mostly.

444
00:25:37,242 --> 00:25:39,858
When he's not growing
weed without my say-so.

445
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,391
Don't blame him.

446
00:25:42,511 --> 00:25:45,407
I done most of the
work on that score.

447
00:25:45,475 --> 00:25:49,678
You shoulda come to
me, Loretta, straight up.

448
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:55,049
We'll work something out.

449
00:25:57,596 --> 00:25:59,548
As for the pervert,

450
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:04,430
you don't have to worry
about him no more.

451
00:26:22,879 --> 00:26:27,849
Sir, would you think I'm bold
to inquire what you do as your job?

452
00:26:27,917 --> 00:26:31,316
Well, which one's the question...
What do I think, or what do I do?

453
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:34,289
Loretta, don't you
know drug enforcement?

454
00:26:34,357 --> 00:26:36,057
You see a man in a
suit of clothes?

455
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:37,313
They come around sniffin' the air.

456
00:26:37,433 --> 00:26:39,195
Oh, no, no,
you got us wrong.

457
00:26:39,315 --> 00:26:40,662
We're marshals service.

458
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:44,497
We go around smelling flowers till
we get turned on to wanted felons.

459
00:26:45,134 --> 00:26:46,724
Raylan Givens.

460
00:26:46,844 --> 00:26:48,379
Mrs. Bennett.

461
00:26:48,499 --> 00:26:51,247
This is deputy Rachel Brooks.

462
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:53,437
Deputy.

463
00:26:54,431 --> 00:26:57,379
Been away so long you
forgot to call me Mags.

464
00:26:57,447 --> 00:26:59,675
Ah, I didn't
want to presume.

465
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:03,652
Loretta, this
is Raylan Givens.

466
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:07,420
He used to be a big baseball
player in high school.

467
00:27:07,788 --> 00:27:10,892
Now he's a federal.

468
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,189
Oh, look at poor Loretta, eyes drooping,
us talking about the old days.

469
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:16,902
You run along home, Loretta.

470
00:27:17,022 --> 00:27:18,741
Let us ancients catch up.

471
00:27:22,477 --> 00:27:24,656
Can I interest you
in some apple pie?

472
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:26,777
I remember your apple pie.

473
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:30,668
I make it 180 proof.

474
00:27:31,147 --> 00:27:34,641
Cut it with cider, some apple juice,
add some cinnamon and vanilla.

475
00:27:34,761 --> 00:27:36,382
Reach me that glass, would you?

476
00:27:37,174 --> 00:27:39,138
Coulda done with a
pinch more cinnamon.

477
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:41,232
Cinnamon really sells the pie.

478
00:27:41,352 --> 00:27:42,760
As good as I remember it.

479
00:27:43,312 --> 00:27:45,100
Would you like some, ma'am?

480
00:27:45,567 --> 00:27:47,110
No, thank you.

481
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,277
How's business, Mags?

482
00:27:50,466 --> 00:27:52,434
This place?

483
00:27:52,502 --> 00:27:54,022
I get by.

484
00:27:54,142 --> 00:27:55,971
And the rest?

485
00:27:56,038 --> 00:27:57,806
So that's why you're here.

486
00:27:57,874 --> 00:28:00,408
You go ahead and prove it.

487
00:28:00,476 --> 00:28:04,460
I run a store, help these poor
people come up from the holler

488
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,147
with their food stamps.

489
00:28:06,215 --> 00:28:08,423
When's anybody seen me cultivate a herb?

490
00:28:08,543 --> 00:28:09,852
I told you, Mags.

491
00:28:09,972 --> 00:28:11,437
We're not Drug enforcement.

492
00:28:11,932 --> 00:28:15,123
As long as they
got nothing on you, we don't, either.

493
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:18,773
I hear you got a good thousand
acres, from here to west Virginia.

494
00:28:20,386 --> 00:28:21,830
What's good about it?

495
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,466
You plant a third for the law,
a third for the thieves.

496
00:28:24,586 --> 00:28:27,791
What's left you sell to the dealers,
the ones making the real profit.

497
00:28:28,484 --> 00:28:32,503
Used to be, marijuana was the
number-one cash crop in Kentucky.

498
00:28:32,623 --> 00:28:36,786
Now you got all the pills, worse
even than methamphetamine.

499
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,584
I don't have anything
to do with that.

500
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,301
I remember your granddaddy.

501
00:28:47,304 --> 00:28:50,226
He cooked all week and
preached on Sunday.

502
00:28:50,617 --> 00:28:53,379
Six years I came over to Harlan
and sold all the liquor he

503
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:55,912
cooked, and we did
better than fair.

504
00:28:57,073 --> 00:28:59,124
How is your daddy?

505
00:28:59,192 --> 00:29:01,605
He's at home,
far as I know.

506
00:29:01,725 --> 00:29:03,629
I heard what happened
with the Crowders.

507
00:29:03,696 --> 00:29:05,564
Ooh, that blew up big.

508
00:29:05,632 --> 00:29:07,132
Have you seen Boyd?

509
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,829
No. Why?

510
00:29:09,141 --> 00:29:10,836
Mm, just need a word.

511
00:29:10,904 --> 00:29:13,472
You come here
looking for Boyd Crowder? That it?

512
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,339
Hey.

513
00:29:14,407 --> 00:29:15,507
Hello, there, cowboy.

514
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:18,148
Hello, Doyle.

515
00:29:18,473 --> 00:29:20,185
I'm guessing this
ain't a coincidence.

516
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:21,313
Well, word travels.

517
00:29:21,381 --> 00:29:22,450
You and your hat are famous.

518
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:26,718
Doyle, this is deputy
Rachel Brooks.

519
00:29:26,786 --> 00:29:27,719
Ma'am.

520
00:29:27,787 --> 00:29:29,821
So what brings you
both to our town?

521
00:29:29,889 --> 00:29:32,053
Raylan's looking
for Boyd Crowder.

522
00:29:32,173 --> 00:29:33,325
Actually, no.

523
00:29:33,393 --> 00:29:35,515
We're looking
for James Earl Dean.

524
00:29:37,748 --> 00:29:40,119
Never trust a man
with three first names.

525
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:41,640
Not this one, anyway.

526
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,268
He some big
federal fugitive?

527
00:29:43,336 --> 00:29:44,525
He's a sex offender.

528
00:29:44,645 --> 00:29:46,697
I didn't know that was
on the marshals' purview.

529
00:29:46,817 --> 00:29:49,041
It got added to
the plate this year.

530
00:29:49,108 --> 00:29:50,976
Why you looking
for him here?

531
00:29:51,044 --> 00:29:52,844
Word is, he works for you.

532
00:29:52,912 --> 00:29:54,572
You think I
hire sex offenders?

533
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,101
It's not against the law.

534
00:29:56,221 --> 00:29:58,050
Maybe your boys hired him.

535
00:29:58,117 --> 00:30:01,956
I mean, not Doyle, of course,
but Coover or Dickie?

536
00:30:02,076 --> 00:30:04,923
Neither me nor my
tads would do such a thing.

537
00:30:04,991 --> 00:30:07,159
We're reefer farmers, Raylan.

538
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,238
We don't consort with
sexual deviants.

539
00:30:10,358 --> 00:30:13,065
I respect how you feel,
Mags, and I know you love

540
00:30:13,132 --> 00:30:15,637
your tads, but we're gonna
want to talk to them,

541
00:30:15,757 --> 00:30:17,005
in your presence, if you'd like.

542
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:20,205
You can invite them here, or
we'll just go hunt them down.

543
00:30:20,273 --> 00:30:22,518
You ever get to talk to them
face-to-face.

544
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,142
This might help ease the pain.

545
00:30:25,402 --> 00:30:27,259
You sure ma'am?

546
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,269
I am.

547
00:30:31,184 --> 00:30:33,118
Well, if you'll excuse me.

548
00:30:33,186 --> 00:30:34,319
Hmm.

549
00:30:34,387 --> 00:30:37,055
Don't take anything
without paying for it.

550
00:30:37,123 --> 00:30:39,992
Mama, you really
are a mean, old coot.

551
00:30:42,428 --> 00:30:44,329
So is this your uniform?

552
00:30:44,397 --> 00:30:45,497
My day off.

553
00:30:45,565 --> 00:30:46,265
Oh.

554
00:30:46,332 --> 00:30:48,133
Still driving the
company car, though.

555
00:30:48,201 --> 00:30:49,967
You think that's
a misappropriation?

556
00:30:50,087 --> 00:30:52,365
You want to come back,
run against me?

557
00:30:52,485 --> 00:30:54,431
Oh, I could
never do your job.

558
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:56,108
I just want to say hey.

559
00:30:56,175 --> 00:30:59,177
You sure this guy
doesn't work for your clan?

560
00:30:59,245 --> 00:31:00,178
I couldn't tell you.

561
00:31:00,246 --> 00:31:03,749
I'm not in the family
business, as you know.

562
00:31:03,816 --> 00:31:05,083
Good to see you, Raylan.

563
00:31:05,151 --> 00:31:07,319
Good to see
you, too, Doyle.

564
00:31:07,387 --> 00:31:09,054
Ma'am.

565
00:31:09,122 --> 00:31:12,224
Either of you want to
take anything, go ahead.

566
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:13,558
Just leave a note.

567
00:31:13,626 --> 00:31:14,893
I'll cover it.

568
00:31:14,961 --> 00:31:16,695
Maybe we will.
Thank you.

569
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,448
Raylan Givens.

570
00:32:20,492 --> 00:32:23,819
I seen you and your hat on
the TV some weeks back.

571
00:32:23,887 --> 00:32:25,954
How'd I look?

572
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,223
Must have been official.

573
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:29,491
You weren't smiling.

574
00:32:30,727 --> 00:32:32,748
That's just Coover shooting rats.

575
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,863
Okay.

576
00:32:34,931 --> 00:32:36,999
Okay.

577
00:32:37,067 --> 00:32:40,069
Um, I don't know if
anyone called you,

578
00:32:40,136 --> 00:32:42,522
we're looking for someone in your
employ,

579
00:32:42,876 --> 00:32:45,055
Jimmy Earl Dean.
Is he here?

580
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:46,675
Was.

581
00:32:46,743 --> 00:32:47,810
Took off.

582
00:32:47,877 --> 00:32:49,478
When?

583
00:32:49,546 --> 00:32:50,746
Few minutes ago.

584
00:32:51,915 --> 00:32:54,249
For what it's worth, I never
knew he was a molester.

585
00:32:54,317 --> 00:32:55,784
Hell.

586
00:33:00,101 --> 00:33:02,257
All that shootin',
that's all you got?

587
00:33:02,325 --> 00:33:06,295
Another one of them sumbitches
in there, you want to take a try at it.

588
00:33:06,362 --> 00:33:07,896
I shot rats as a kid.

589
00:33:07,964 --> 00:33:10,265
Used to chase 'em out
of the shit houses.

590
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:12,901
All's you have to do is
go in the kitchen, huh?

591
00:33:12,969 --> 00:33:14,937
Where I know you?

592
00:33:15,004 --> 00:33:18,307
Coover, this
is Raylan Givens.

593
00:33:18,374 --> 00:33:19,708
So?

594
00:33:20,903 --> 00:33:23,026
So, he is a federal.

595
00:33:25,757 --> 00:33:32,129
Well, you can ask me, am I
growin' reefer, and I will tell you no.

596
00:33:38,328 --> 00:33:43,732
Coover, you throw a dead rat at
my car, what are you trying to tell me?

597
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,968
Take it any
way you want, Raylan.

598
00:33:46,035 --> 00:33:48,495
Long as you know I'm serious.

599
00:33:50,713 --> 00:33:53,008
You're telling me
you're a mean son of a bitch.

600
00:33:53,076 --> 00:33:56,745
You know how many wanted felons
have given me this look?

601
00:33:56,813 --> 00:33:58,827
I say a thousand.

602
00:33:58,947 --> 00:34:00,030
I know I'm low.

603
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:03,129
Something turn ugly as I put on the cuffs,
they're too late.

604
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,252
Some others, I swear,

605
00:34:05,372 --> 00:34:08,056
they even try to draw down on me.

606
00:34:09,107 --> 00:34:10,826
Dickie, you hear that?

607
00:34:10,894 --> 00:34:11,760
He's threatenin' us.

608
00:34:11,828 --> 00:34:13,448
No, he ain't.

609
00:34:13,568 --> 00:34:15,181
He's got a
piece under his coat.

610
00:34:15,301 --> 00:34:17,366
And you have one in
your hand, for Christ's sake.

611
00:34:17,433 --> 00:34:18,800
Yeah, so does the negress!

612
00:34:18,868 --> 00:34:20,869
Rachel, if Coover
raises his piece, shoot him.

613
00:34:20,937 --> 00:34:22,739
If you'll move
a step either way.

614
00:34:30,716 --> 00:34:35,004
Coover, put
the gun down now.

615
00:34:36,815 --> 00:34:38,520
I said now, God damn it!

616
00:34:51,267 --> 00:34:56,171
- Well, if you see your friend...
- Ex-employee.

617
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,076
Tell him, if he comes in
on his own, it's worth a lot.

618
00:35:00,196 --> 00:35:02,277
If not, different story.

619
00:35:02,345 --> 00:35:04,613
It's good to see you, Dickie.

620
00:35:04,681 --> 00:35:05,948
You too, Raylan.

621
00:35:06,015 --> 00:35:08,650
You too.

622
00:35:08,718 --> 00:35:10,652
You and your hat.

623
00:35:32,809 --> 00:35:35,377
Get up.

624
00:35:36,058 --> 00:35:41,483
Get up slowly, quietly, because
if you wake him...

625
00:35:41,551 --> 00:35:43,986
...I will kill him.

626
00:35:44,053 --> 00:35:46,355
So things have changed.

627
00:35:46,422 --> 00:35:50,926
I am no longer welcome here in
Harlan, which means

628
00:35:50,994 --> 00:35:52,894
it's time for a little road trip.

629
00:35:52,962 --> 00:35:55,964
Are you up for that, sweetheart?

630
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:58,834
This is where you nod.

631
00:35:58,901 --> 00:36:01,036
There you go.

632
00:36:01,104 --> 00:36:04,306
Now, you're gonna have to ride
in the trunk for a little while.

633
00:36:04,374 --> 00:36:08,010
Anybody sees the two of us, they might
not understand our age difference.

634
00:36:08,077 --> 00:36:09,400
Or the tape.

635
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,927
Get in.

636
00:36:28,284 --> 00:36:29,050
Givens.

637
00:36:29,118 --> 00:36:29,751
Listen.

638
00:36:29,818 --> 00:36:31,252
Our bolo paid off.

639
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,122
Patrol clocked Dean on 75,
headed towards Tennessee.

640
00:36:34,189 --> 00:36:35,156
What exit?

641
00:36:35,224 --> 00:36:37,292
Passed 11 less
than five minutes ago.

642
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:38,760
Any sign of the girl?

643
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:40,628
Well, he didn't
get too close.

644
00:36:40,696 --> 00:36:41,999
Didn't want to spook Mr. Dean.

645
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,768
All right.
Well that's a smart play.

646
00:36:43,888 --> 00:36:46,027
If she's with him, and we should
assume she is,

647
00:36:46,147 --> 00:36:48,235
get to a roadblock, or a strip.

648
00:36:48,355 --> 00:36:49,636
That's right.

649
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,255
You want me to call
in some backup?

650
00:37:07,323 --> 00:37:08,423
All right.

651
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,891
We got this far being smart.

652
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:10,925
Let's not blow it now.

653
00:37:10,993 --> 00:37:13,303
You tell me if he comes back.

654
00:37:17,366 --> 00:37:19,087
Loretta?

655
00:37:20,169 --> 00:37:21,636
You all right?

656
00:37:22,871 --> 00:37:25,106
You kick twice
if you're okay.

657
00:37:26,608 --> 00:37:28,476
All right. We're gonna get you out
of there... one minute.

658
00:37:28,544 --> 00:37:29,277
He left something.

659
00:37:29,345 --> 00:37:30,736
He's on his way out.

660
00:37:32,377 --> 00:37:37,231
Loretta, right now I need you
to make yourself as small as possible.

661
00:37:40,155 --> 00:37:42,190
Hey!

662
00:37:42,257 --> 00:37:44,178
What the hell are you doing?

663
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,028
What's it
look like I'm doing?

664
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,897
Are you stealing gas?

665
00:37:50,596 --> 00:37:51,766
Yeah.

666
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:55,169
Shit, you caught me.

667
00:37:55,237 --> 00:37:57,638
I'm stealing gas.

668
00:37:57,706 --> 00:38:00,441
I don't know why I do it.

669
00:38:00,509 --> 00:38:02,510
It's not like I can't afford it.

670
00:38:02,578 --> 00:38:03,512
Yeah. Whatever.

671
00:38:03,632 --> 00:38:04,545
Get out of here.

672
00:38:04,613 --> 00:38:06,114
Can't I just
have a couple gallons?

673
00:38:06,181 --> 00:38:06,948
Look, asshole.

674
00:38:07,016 --> 00:38:09,385
I'm gonna tell you one more time...

675
00:38:11,196 --> 00:38:12,456
What the hell?!

676
00:38:12,955 --> 00:38:14,155
Hey!

677
00:38:14,223 --> 00:38:15,690
That's it.

678
00:38:15,758 --> 00:38:16,657
Whoa!

679
00:38:16,725 --> 00:38:19,060
Okay, I'm just gonna
ask you one question.

680
00:38:19,128 --> 00:38:22,037
Do you know how a firearm works?

681
00:38:22,277 --> 00:38:23,564
What?

682
00:38:23,632 --> 00:38:26,567
The key word
in firearm is "fire."

683
00:38:26,635 --> 00:38:30,271
When the pin hits the cap, makes
the charge explode, meaning

684
00:38:30,339 --> 00:38:34,526
there's a spark, which should be of some
concern to a man soaked in gasoline.

685
00:38:35,611 --> 00:38:37,512
That's bullshit.

686
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:39,631
That spark's too far
away from the gasoline.

687
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:42,383
You didn't finish
school, did you, Mr. Dean?

688
00:38:42,451 --> 00:38:44,986
It's not the liquid that burns.

689
00:38:45,054 --> 00:38:47,722
It's the fumes.

690
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,089
Now, look.

691
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,986
Normally I would have just shot you
myself the second you pulled.

692
00:38:55,106 --> 00:38:56,869
But I am doing my level best

693
00:38:57,572 --> 00:38:59,114
to avoid the paperwork

694
00:38:59,234 --> 00:39:01,074
and the self-recrimination
that comes with it.

695
00:39:01,194 --> 00:39:02,078
The Lord knows,

696
00:39:02,198 --> 00:39:04,654
you are the kind that
makes it worth it more.

697
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:08,910
Come on, Jimmy.

698
00:39:08,977 --> 00:39:11,579
Can't we just try to end this
without you turning yourself

699
00:39:11,647 --> 00:39:13,181
into the human torch?

700
00:39:13,248 --> 00:39:15,149
You know my name.

701
00:39:15,217 --> 00:39:17,382
Then you know what I
got in that trunk.

702
00:39:18,654 --> 00:39:20,221
How about I just kill her?

703
00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:21,804
Gasoline aside,

704
00:39:22,795 --> 00:39:24,408
you aim that in any direction,

705
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,418
my partner's gonna pop
you in the head.

706
00:39:28,602 --> 00:39:30,665
There you go.

707
00:39:30,732 --> 00:39:31,599
Hey.

708
00:39:34,036 --> 00:39:35,468
Slow.

709
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:39,073
Slow.

710
00:39:54,022 --> 00:39:55,833
This might hurt.

711
00:40:01,163 --> 00:40:03,531
Would he have really
gone up like a torch?

712
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:04,465
Oh, I don't know.

713
00:40:04,533 --> 00:40:07,034
But it sounded good.

714
00:40:07,102 --> 00:40:09,638
I call it apple pie.

715
00:40:10,939 --> 00:40:12,173
Go ahead.

716
00:40:12,241 --> 00:40:14,175
Tell me what you think.

717
00:40:22,618 --> 00:40:24,352
It's good.

718
00:40:24,419 --> 00:40:26,521
It does taste like apple pie.

719
00:40:26,588 --> 00:40:28,077
It does, doesn't it?

720
00:40:35,063 --> 00:40:38,132
Loretta okay?

721
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,268
Fine, under
the circumstances.

722
00:40:44,206 --> 00:40:46,007
Where is she at?

723
00:40:46,074 --> 00:40:48,285
Down the holler
with a friend.

724
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:53,743
When the police brought her
back,

725
00:40:54,663 --> 00:40:56,630
did they ask about your leg?

726
00:40:57,386 --> 00:40:58,686
They did.

727
00:40:58,754 --> 00:41:01,422
I told them that I
was fixing the trap.

728
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:04,283
When I was prying it
open, my leg slipped in.

729
00:41:09,631 --> 00:41:11,732
How about the gunshot wound?

730
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,188
They didn't mention it.

731
00:41:17,362 --> 00:41:18,579
Well Walt...

732
00:41:19,471 --> 00:41:21,657
it's on the kind of all I had,
that I come here.

733
00:41:22,989 --> 00:41:26,342
brought this
'shine as a peace offering.

734
00:41:30,953 --> 00:41:32,909
I want Dickie to apologize to you.

735
00:41:43,893 --> 00:41:45,266
Oh.

736
00:41:45,334 --> 00:41:46,815
Right.

737
00:41:46,935 --> 00:41:48,869
Right.

738
00:41:48,937 --> 00:41:50,054
Um...

739
00:41:50,946 --> 00:41:51,795
Walt,

740
00:41:53,634 --> 00:41:56,351
I should not have shot you
in the leg or trapped your foot.

741
00:41:57,579 --> 00:42:00,597
And um...Uh...

742
00:42:01,588 --> 00:42:03,824
We could work
something out about you growing.

743
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:17,411
It was already in the
glass, not in the jar.

744
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,801
Why Dickie and me can
drink and be okay.

745
00:42:28,146 --> 00:42:30,313
It's too late now, Walt.

746
00:42:31,013 --> 00:42:33,681
Medicine already doing its work.

747
00:42:35,217 --> 00:42:40,639
Even if you got on a helicopter right
now, you'd still be past care.

748
00:42:44,192 --> 00:42:45,993
Why?

749
00:42:46,971 --> 00:42:48,846
Why do you think?

750
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:50,965
Because I called
that police line?

751
00:42:52,579 --> 00:42:54,730
You never go outside, Walt.

752
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,070
You know that.

753
00:42:56,138 --> 00:42:58,306
I didn't know
he worked for you!

754
00:42:58,373 --> 00:43:00,574
Gaahh!

755
00:43:00,642 --> 00:43:02,950
Oh, this is the bad part,

756
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,653
but it doesn't last long.

757
00:43:07,449 --> 00:43:11,968
The mixture's all natural,
from up in the hills.

758
00:43:12,563 --> 00:43:14,586
All kinds of knowledge
in the hills.

759
00:43:15,011 --> 00:43:17,148
It's something my
grandmama taught me.

760
00:43:17,268 --> 00:43:20,045
She learned it from her grandmama.

761
00:43:20,165 --> 00:43:24,730
- Loretta...
- I'll raise her myself.

762
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,491
Don't you think that'll be better for her?

763
00:43:28,994 --> 00:43:31,822
The way it's been around here with you
and her sadness.

764
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:38,669
All the troubles of your hard life,

765
00:43:40,282 --> 00:43:42,185
it's all gone now.

766
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:47,521
You get to know the mystery, Walt.

767
00:43:50,058 --> 00:43:52,759
You get to see
your Sally Ann again.

768
00:44:09,344 --> 00:44:11,278
Find the girl.

769
00:44:28,663 --> 00:44:30,931
Beer?

770
00:44:44,063 --> 00:44:45,746
So, how's work?

771
00:44:45,814 --> 00:44:47,548
Exhilarating.

772
00:44:47,616 --> 00:44:48,634
What do you think?

773
00:44:51,038 --> 00:44:53,654
Did you really call me here
to talk to me about work?

774
00:44:53,722 --> 00:44:55,389
Not unless
it's exhilarating.

775
00:44:56,358 --> 00:45:00,094
I was starting to think you
were never gonna call me.

776
00:45:00,162 --> 00:45:01,962
And don't say you've been busy.

777
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:03,230
No one's that busy.

778
00:45:09,805 --> 00:45:12,076
- I like the ambiance.
- I pay extra for that.

779
00:45:14,042 --> 00:45:17,545
Did I scare you off, when I
said we should get together and talk?

780
00:45:17,612 --> 00:45:18,779
No.

781
00:45:20,461 --> 00:45:22,783
Then why am I out
here, breathing diesel?

782
00:45:23,995 --> 00:45:26,702
Last time you were in there,
you took off your wedding ring.

783
00:45:26,822 --> 00:45:31,158
Oh, yeah, and as I recall,
you put up a hell of a fight.

784
00:45:31,226 --> 00:45:34,028
I mean, if you really wanted to
talk, we'd have met on neutral

785
00:45:34,095 --> 00:45:37,297
ground and not five feet and a flimsy
door away from that lumpy bed of yours.

786
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:38,699
Okay. No.

787
00:45:38,767 --> 00:45:41,202
I invited you here because I'm
tired,

788
00:45:41,269 --> 00:45:44,345
and I wanted to have
a word before I went to sleep.

789
00:45:47,742 --> 00:45:49,470
So what's keeping you?

790
00:45:59,554 --> 00:46:01,856
Son of a bitch!

791
00:46:02,288 --> 00:46:07,567
Yeah, that's what a girl wants
to hear for pillow talk... regret.

792
00:46:13,034 --> 00:46:14,802
Oh, you're gonna get that?

793
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:16,036
Givens.

794
00:46:16,104 --> 00:46:17,705
Raylan, it's
trooper Tom Bergen.

795
00:46:17,772 --> 00:46:19,940
Oh, hey, Tom.

796
00:46:20,008 --> 00:46:21,108
What's up?

797
00:46:21,176 --> 00:46:22,943
Am I catching
you at a bad time?

798
00:46:23,011 --> 00:46:24,451
No, no, no, it's fine.

799
00:46:24,571 --> 00:46:27,948
Okay. Well, I got a line on
Boyd Crowder for you.

800
00:46:28,016 --> 00:46:29,550
Finally surfaced, huh?

801
00:46:29,618 --> 00:46:32,136
Yeah, in a
manner of speaking.

802
00:46:47,168 --> 00:46:49,436
Fire in the hole!

803
00:46:49,504 --> 00:46:52,172
Fire in the hole!

804
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,174
Fire in the hole!

805
00:46:55,729 --> 00:47:04,988
