00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,779
This "pestilent dust"
has appeared only three times.

3
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:33,460
It was found to be limestone...
Messy, but innocuous.

4
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:39,020
- Innocuous?
- Harmless.

5
00:03:39,181 --> 00:03:42,380
I know what it means. May I?
(Subtitle Revised by HchC)

6
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,501
Your Honour...

7
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:51,381
Imagine how
the neighborhood children feel.

8
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:55,900
The pounding of construction
ringing in their ears.

9
00:03:56,061 --> 00:04:00,660
This skyscraper, a tribute
to mankind's greed, grows daily.

10
00:04:00,862 --> 00:04:06,261
It casts a shadow over their lives
and surrounds them with toxic dust.

11
00:04:07,462 --> 00:04:12,901
Kendall Construction is rebuilding
this neighborhood.

12
00:04:13,062 --> 00:04:19,541
Granting a restraining order here
will throw 753 people out of work.

13
00:04:19,701 --> 00:04:24,901
You cannot validate this groundless
example of rapacious litigation.

14
00:04:25,062 --> 00:04:30,462
- It is a threat to our society.
- Let's not go off the deep end.

15
00:04:30,622 --> 00:04:34,581
You have made
a compelling case, Mr. Miller.

16
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:37,941
- But there is no irreparable harm.
- Not yet.

17
00:04:56,383 --> 00:05:01,463
- Is that you?
- Yeah, it's me.

18
00:05:01,623 --> 00:05:05,702
- A client of yours?
- Funny!

19
00:05:05,863 --> 00:05:09,782
Excuse me, sir...

20
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:40,583
I went to a restaurant the other day
and ordered coffee.

21
00:05:40,783 --> 00:05:45,903
The waiter asked, "Would you
like sugar or Sweet & Low?"

22
00:05:46,064 --> 00:05:50,623
I said, "Do I look like
I should be on a diet?"

23
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,183
- Andy.
- Hi, Doc.

24
00:05:55,344 --> 00:06:00,344
Your blood work came back.
When I return, we'll discuss it.

25
00:06:00,503 --> 00:06:03,583
I'll be right here.

26
00:06:04,784 --> 00:06:09,344
- Hi, how are you feeling?
- Pretty good.

27
00:06:09,504 --> 00:06:13,423
Make a fist for me.

28
00:06:13,584 --> 00:06:19,023
We're gonna have to start
looking for veins in your feet.

29
00:06:45,465 --> 00:06:49,585
- Terrific job on the Kendall case.
- Thanks, Kenneth.

30
00:06:50,825 --> 00:06:55,424
Anthea, just the paralegal
extraordinaire I was hoping to see.

31
00:06:55,585 --> 00:06:59,705
- The answer is no.
- Dinner at Felicia's...

32
00:06:59,865 --> 00:07:03,544
- I've got a class.
- My briefs need proofing.

33
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:07,585
Exploit somebody else.
Since you've asked...

34
00:07:07,745 --> 00:07:11,424
- Your exam!
- 98.

35
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,864
98! Congratulations!

36
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:20,744
- Let's talk about the Hansen case.
- Yeah. Thank Amy for the painting.

37
00:07:20,905 --> 00:07:27,665
Here are the numbers. The copy's
on your desk. Do you need me?

38
00:07:27,826 --> 00:07:31,065
No. It's 6:30. Go home.

39
00:07:33,225 --> 00:07:37,985
Hello? Hi, darling.
What a surprise. How are you?

40
00:07:38,146 --> 00:07:42,065
- Good.
- What does Dr. Gillman say?

41
00:07:42,226 --> 00:07:47,945
She says I am fine.
My blood work is excellent.

42
00:07:48,106 --> 00:07:54,105
- How about my platelets?
- Even my platelets look good.

43
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:58,826
Mom, more importantly,
how are you?

44
00:08:00,907 --> 00:08:05,587
- I'm fine. Your dad is fine.
- What are you doing?

45
00:08:38,348 --> 00:08:43,467
- Andy, am I interrupting you?
- In a word, Bob.

46
00:08:43,627 --> 00:08:47,706
Charles wants to see you upstairs.

47
00:08:47,867 --> 00:08:53,547
I was just about to take a break.
You're sure I'm not underdressed?

48
00:08:53,747 --> 00:09:00,307
Andy has expressed a keen interest
in Highline versus Sander Systems.

49
00:09:00,467 --> 00:09:07,187
- The participants interest me.
- It's an anti-trust action.

50
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:16,308
Is it? Sander Systems copies
High line¡¦s spreadsheet program.

51
00:09:16,468 --> 00:09:23,068
For me, the legal principle involved
is copyright infringement.

52
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:30,228
Tell me this, Andy which side would
you like to see emerge victorious?

53
00:09:30,388 --> 00:09:37,228
Don't be influenced by my friendship
with Sander's CEO Bill Wright.

54
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:43,708
- I'd like to see Highline win.
- Why, Beckett?

55
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:52,709
If Sander Systems wins, an energetic
young company is destroyed.

56
00:09:52,909 --> 00:10:00,389
Copyright laws were enacted to stop
exactly what Sander are doing.

57
00:10:00,549 --> 00:10:04,389
- You know who reps Highline.
- Rodney Bailey.

58
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:12,948
He couldn't find his way around
copyright law with a map.

59
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:19,348
Apparently the fellas
at Highline agree with you.

60
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:24,509
Therefore, as of 9:03 this evening,
right after the dessert course,

61
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:30,109
they're now represented by Wyant,
Wheeler, Hellerman, Tetlow & Brown.

62
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,430
Outstanding!

63
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:39,189
And more specifically,
senior associate Andrew Beckett.

64
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:55,309
- Thank you, Robert.
- Start on Highline right away.

65
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,910
- I'm right on it.
- We have to file within ten days.

66
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:04,190
- Tokyo on line four, Bob.
- Walter, thank you.

67
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:09,550
- Thank you, Kenneth.
- Congratulations.

68
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,990
- What's that on your forehead?
- Where?

69
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:17,031
That, right there on your forehead.

70
00:11:17,191 --> 00:11:22,710
I got whacked
with a racquet ball... Excuse me.

71
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:33,711
Charles... I sincerely appreciate
your faith in my abilities.

72
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:38,630
Faith is a belief in something
for which we have no evidence.

73
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:42,431
It does not apply in this situation.

74
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:50,190
Go home.
No... go back to work!

75
00:11:58,352 --> 00:12:03,271
- Thank you, Charles.
- No sweat, buddy.

76
00:12:29,032 --> 00:12:32,551
Tommy, how are you?

77
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:07,073
The complaints on my desk, Shelby.
Tell Jamey to get on top of it

78
00:13:07,273 --> 00:13:09,312
Anything else?

79
00:13:09,473 --> 00:13:15,312
No, I'll be working out of the house
for the rest of the afternoon.

80
00:13:15,513 --> 00:13:18,153
Bye.

81
00:13:18,314 --> 00:13:23,833
You want to apply the foundation
as evenly as you can.

82
00:13:23,993 --> 00:13:30,753
It shouldn't look like
you threw it on with a spoon.

83
00:13:30,914 --> 00:13:34,754
You don't think this
is a little too orange for me?

84
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:39,034
It's Tahitian Bronze.
That works best on these lesions.

85
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:45,593
- Say you've been to Aruba.
- I've called in sick for four days.

86
00:13:45,754 --> 00:13:48,673
Now they'll think I was on a cruise.

87
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:51,953
- Fax.
- Thank you, Bruno.

88
00:13:52,114 --> 00:13:55,154
We could try this Light Egypt...

89
00:13:55,314 --> 00:13:59,073
- What?
- Andy?

90
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:04,395
Excuse me.

91
00:14:09,154 --> 00:14:13,353
Just like my cousin Fredo.

92
00:14:18,635 --> 00:14:22,674
Hi... Does anybody want a bagel?

93
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:37,314
Are you okay, Andy?

94
00:14:38,156 --> 00:14:42,835
I need to go to the hospital.

95
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:18,116
- It's all right.
- I'm getting out of here.

96
00:15:18,276 --> 00:15:22,875
- One more.
- Thank you for driving me here.

97
00:15:23,076 --> 00:15:27,756
I told Dr. Gillman to take a day off
and she took a day off!

98
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:34,435
- Did they take a specimen?
- Blood... I'm empty.

99
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:40,196
You have a fever, baby.

100
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:45,115
- This is my guy. Excuse me...
- Just one second.

101
00:15:46,597 --> 00:15:52,436
I ran to the bathroom. I almost
lost it in front of everybody.

102
00:15:52,637 --> 00:15:56,796
- It's nothing to be ashamed of.
- It's just...

103
00:15:56,957 --> 00:16:02,877
- Any news on my blood work?
- No. We'll do a colonoscopy.

104
00:16:08,277 --> 00:16:12,117
- It sounds delightful.
- Wait. Why do that?

105
00:16:12,277 --> 00:16:15,477
- Who are you?
- Who are you, Doctor...

106
00:16:15,637 --> 00:16:18,756
This is my partner.

107
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:23,916
- He records all my hospital visits.
- I'm Dr. Klenstein.

108
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:30,997
A colonoscopy will show us if it's
the K.S. Causing the diarrhea.

109
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:36,997
- It could be an infection...
- A reaction to AZT.

110
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:39,917
That's possible...

111
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,318
He's not having this
until we cancel out everything else.

112
00:16:44,478 --> 00:16:48,998
I'm trying to help your partner.
You're not a member of his family.

113
00:16:49,157 --> 00:16:53,997
- I could have you removed.
- He's upset. He's sorry.

114
00:16:54,158 --> 00:16:59,278
- No, don't apologize for me.
- Okay, he's not sorry.

115
00:16:59,438 --> 00:17:05,879
Let's see what the blood work
tells us. I'll give a specimen.

116
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:10,958
Maybe we'll hear from Dr. Gillman.
Everybody happy?

117
00:17:11,879 --> 00:17:16,719
- I'll check on the blood work.
- Sorry...

118
00:17:19,198 --> 00:17:23,958
- That's the third time.
- Dr. Klenstein...

119
00:17:24,158 --> 00:17:27,998
I have to call the office.
I want you to relax.

120
00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:33,399
- I am relaxed.
- Good. Is there a phone around?

121
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:42,118
If you have been injured, you may
be entitled to a cash settlement...

122
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:45,479
Good Lord!

123
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:45,798
- Mr. Beckett's office.
- Shelby, it's me.

124
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:49,159
- Mr. Beckett's office.
- Shelby, it's me.

125
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,678
- Jamey beeped me.
- I'm glad you called.

126
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:59,559
It's about the Highline complaint.
Jamey is going ballistic!

127
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:04,799
- Calm down. Put him on.
- One second.

128
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,879
- Where's the Highline complaint?
- Wait! Slow down.

129
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:14,119
It was supposed to be here
this morning.

130
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:21,759
I left it in my office last night.
I put the corrected copy on my desk.

131
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:27,480
- I'm telling you, it's not here.
- All right, try my hard disk.

132
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,600
You'll have
to print it out yourself.

133
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,920
- What did you file it under?
- HL1.

134
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,960
You know that there's
a statute of limitations on this.

135
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:42,001
It runs out...

136
00:18:42,161 --> 00:18:44,600
in 75 minutes.

137
00:18:46,961 --> 00:18:52,321
- It's not here. Andy.
- It's not there? I'm on my way!

138
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,160
Every problem has a solution.

139
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,960
Push, baby.

140
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:15,361
It's a girl!

141
00:19:19,081 --> 00:19:23,601
- Take a picture, Joe.
- I can't get the film in there.

142
00:19:23,801 --> 00:19:27,480
Help me, baby.

143
00:19:29,882 --> 00:19:34,282
Look at her. A sweet little...

144
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:40,041
She's perfect.

145
00:19:41,522 --> 00:19:45,881
Go down to the deli.
Get a pound of Scotch salmon.

146
00:19:46,042 --> 00:19:49,721
Rolls, bagels...
Give me a call.

147
00:19:49,882 --> 00:19:53,401
- And some champagne.
- You're that TV guy.

148
00:19:53,562 --> 00:19:56,121
Dom Perignon.

149
00:19:56,282 --> 00:20:00,361
$100? No, get a nice Californian.

150
00:20:00,522 --> 00:20:06,121
Get it over here, she's starving.
No, not the baby... Lisa!

151
00:20:06,282 --> 00:20:12,282
- Iris... anybody call?
- Yes, an Andrew Beckett

152
00:20:12,442 --> 00:20:16,882
- Who's Andrew Beckett?
- Hey, Joseph!

153
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:53,363
Explain it like I'm a six-year-old.

154
00:20:53,523 --> 00:20:58,603
The entire street is clear except
for a large hole under construction.

155
00:20:58,764 --> 00:21:01,804
It's marked and blocked off.

156
00:21:01,963 --> 00:21:06,163
You decide to cross the street
and fall down the hole.

157
00:21:06,324 --> 00:21:10,844
- Now you want to sue the city.
- Yes. Do I have a case?

158
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:14,763
- Yeah, of course you do.
- Great.

159
00:21:14,964 --> 00:21:19,963
Go with my assistant Iris.
Sort out the fee arrangement.

160
00:21:20,124 --> 00:21:23,403
We take no cash
unless we get justice.

161
00:21:23,604 --> 00:21:27,724
- How's your back? Any pain?
- Now that you mention it...

162
00:21:27,884 --> 00:21:35,124
- Iris, take good care of him.
- I will. Mr. Beckett's here.

163
00:21:35,284 --> 00:21:37,884
Mr. Beckett.

164
00:21:40,244 --> 00:21:44,004
Come in.

165
00:21:47,084 --> 00:21:52,204
Good to see you again, counsellor.
Judge Tate. Kendall Construction.

166
00:21:52,365 --> 00:21:55,724
"Innocuous!"

167
00:21:55,925 --> 00:22:01,725
- What happened to your face?
- I have AIDS.

168
00:22:01,885 --> 00:22:05,244
I'm sorry.

169
00:22:09,685 --> 00:22:13,044
- Can I sit down?
- Yeah.

170
00:22:21,685 --> 00:22:26,885
Look at this...
you have a new baby.

171
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:32,445
Yeah, a little baby girl.

172
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:41,725
- "It's a girl". Congratulations.
- Yeah, one week old.

173
00:22:41,886 --> 00:22:48,206
- Kids are great.
- Yeah, I'm real excited about it.

174
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:57,885
- What can I do for you?
- I've been fired by Wyant Wheeler.

175
00:22:58,046 --> 00:23:02,005
I want to sue them
for wrongful termination.

176
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:05,926
You want to sue Wyant, Wheeler,
Hellerman, Tetlow & Brown?

177
00:23:06,086 --> 00:23:11,646
- Yes. I'm seeking representation.
- Continue.

178
00:23:13,327 --> 00:23:17,727
I misplaced an important complaint.
That's their story.

179
00:23:17,886 --> 00:23:21,406
Do you want to hear mine?

180
00:23:23,126 --> 00:23:27,886
- Have you been to other lawyers?
- Yes, nine.

181
00:23:29,487 --> 00:23:31,766
Continue.

182
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:37,406
The night before it was due, I left
a copy of the complaint on my desk.

183
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:44,967
The next day the complaint vanished.
No hard copy.

184
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:49,446
All traces of it mysteriously gone
from my computer.

185
00:23:50,327 --> 00:23:57,806
Miraculously, a copy was found
just in time to get it to court

186
00:23:57,967 --> 00:24:04,207
But the next day I was summoned
to a meeting with the partners.

187
00:24:04,368 --> 00:24:09,727
Hello, Andy. Come on in.
Hit the windows.

188
00:24:11,088 --> 00:24:16,927
- Thanks. Come on in.
- Hello, everybody.

189
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:20,447
Thanks for coming in.

190
00:24:20,648 --> 00:24:27,607
Before we begin, I'd like to say
that everyone here is your friend.

191
00:24:27,768 --> 00:24:33,448
- I know that, Charles.
- More than your friend. Family.

192
00:24:34,728 --> 00:24:41,128
Charles... I must apologize again
for the Highline mishap yesterday.

193
00:24:41,288 --> 00:24:44,968
That was some scary moment
around here.

194
00:24:45,128 --> 00:24:49,328
Thank God that no damage was done.

195
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:57,208
- This time. What about next time?
- There won't be a next time.

196
00:24:57,849 --> 00:25:03,489
Something's come over you lately.
I don't know...

197
00:25:03,648 --> 00:25:09,728
- A kind of stupor or fogginess.
- You have an attitude problem.

198
00:25:11,889 --> 00:25:14,169
Really?

199
00:25:14,369 --> 00:25:18,489
- Who thinks that?
- I do.

200
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:26,168
Excuse me...
Am I being fired?

201
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:32,769
Let me put it this way: Your place
at this firm is no longer secure.

202
00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:39,529
It isn't fair to keep you here
when your prospects are limited.

203
00:25:39,729 --> 00:25:46,689
- I don't want to rush you...
- We've got a committee meeting.

204
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:52,609
This is preposterous.
It doesn't make any sense.

205
00:25:52,769 --> 00:25:56,728
- You do have an attitude problem.
- Take it easy.

206
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,889
Why did you ever give me Highline?

207
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:06,810
You nearly blew the entire case.
It could have been a catastrophe.

208
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:14,329
You concealed your illness.

209
00:26:16,171 --> 00:26:18,170
That's correct.

210
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:28,730
Explain it like I'm a two-year-old.
I can't seem to grasp this.

211
00:26:28,891 --> 00:26:34,371
Weren't you obliged to tell
your employer you had AIDS?

212
00:26:34,531 --> 00:26:37,210
That's not the point.

213
00:26:37,371 --> 00:26:42,051
I always served my clients
with absolute excellence.

214
00:26:42,211 --> 00:26:45,730
If they hadn't fired me,
I'd still do that.

215
00:26:45,891 --> 00:26:49,250
They couldn't fire you
for being sick,

216
00:26:49,451 --> 00:26:53,130
so they tried
to make you look incompetent.

217
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:56,130
Correct. I was sabotaged.

218
00:26:59,932 --> 00:27:02,851
I don't buy it, counsellor.

219
00:27:03,931 --> 00:27:08,771
- That's very disappointing.
- I don't see a case.

220
00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:14,490
I have a case.

221
00:27:14,651 --> 00:27:19,331
- If you don't want it...
- That's correct. I don't.

222
00:27:21,692 --> 00:27:25,292
Thank you for your time.

223
00:27:26,332 --> 00:27:29,171
Mr. Beckett...

224
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:39,451
I'm sorry about what happened.
It's a bitch.

225
00:27:49,733 --> 00:27:53,932
- Have a nice day, Mr. Beckett.
- What's the matter with that guy?

226
00:27:54,093 --> 00:27:56,812
Iris, get me Armbruster.

227
00:27:56,973 --> 00:28:01,012
I want to see Armbruster
sometime this afternoon.

228
00:28:01,172 --> 00:28:04,132
Right away, Iris.

229
00:28:38,974 --> 00:28:43,333
HIV-virus can only be transmitted
by the exchange of bodily fluids.

230
00:28:43,494 --> 00:28:47,973
Blood, semen,
and vaginal secretions.

231
00:28:48,134 --> 00:28:52,893
But they're finding out new things
about this disease every day.

232
00:28:53,094 --> 00:28:56,693
Today you tell me there's no danger.

233
00:28:56,853 --> 00:29:00,853
But six months from now
you may know different.

234
00:29:01,014 --> 00:29:05,373
Maybe you can carry it
on your shirt or your clothes.

235
00:29:06,734 --> 00:29:09,294
What are you doing?

236
00:29:09,454 --> 00:29:13,214
- We're gonna draw blood.
- Why?

237
00:29:13,414 --> 00:29:22,294
Joe, I've known you a long time.
Your private life is your business.

238
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:30,214
I don't need an AIDS test.
Just send the bill to my office.

239
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:33,734
Thanks for the information.

240
00:29:38,855 --> 00:29:42,374
- You have a problem with gays.
- Not especially.

241
00:29:42,575 --> 00:29:45,934
- Do you know any gays?
- Do you?

242
00:29:46,135 --> 00:29:48,254
- Yes.
- Who?

243
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:51,454
Karen Berman. My Aunt Teresa.

244
00:29:51,615 --> 00:29:56,534
Cousin Tommy in Rochester.
Eddie Meyers from the office.

245
00:29:56,735 --> 00:30:01,815
- Stanley, who fixed the kitchen.
- Aunt Teresa is gay?

246
00:30:01,975 --> 00:30:06,095
That beautiful, voluptuous woman
is a lesbian?

247
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:11,895
- Since when?
- Probably since she was born.

248
00:30:12,055 --> 00:30:17,695
I admit it, okay. I'm prejudiced.
I don't like homosexuals.

249
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:21,976
The way they do that thing.
Don't they get confused?

250
00:30:22,135 --> 00:30:25,015
"Is this yours or mine?"

251
00:30:25,376 --> 00:30:30,856
I don't want to be in bed with
anybody who is stronger than me.

252
00:30:31,016 --> 00:30:36,376
You can call me old-fashioned
and conservative, but I'm a man.

253
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:44,015
Any man will tell you
how disgusting that whole idea is.

254
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:49,335
- Little cave man of the house.
- You damn skippy.

255
00:30:49,496 --> 00:30:53,896
- Stay away from your Aunt Teresa.
- Don't say that to her.

256
00:30:54,056 --> 00:31:00,295
Guys trying to be macho
and faggot at the same time.

257
00:31:00,497 --> 00:31:04,897
- I'm being totally honest with you.
- Yeah, you are.

258
00:31:05,057 --> 00:31:10,896
Would you accept a client
if you were constantly thinking:

259
00:31:11,097 --> 00:31:16,536
"I don't want this person
to touch me or even breathe on me?"

260
00:31:17,217 --> 00:31:22,136
- Not if I was you, honey.
- Exactly... what?

261
00:31:27,696 --> 00:31:30,816
Merry Christmas.

262
00:31:35,577 --> 00:31:39,776
- Thank you.
- Happy New Year.

263
00:31:40,137 --> 00:31:43,177
- You're the...
- TV guy.

264
00:32:33,738 --> 00:32:36,778
This is the supplement.

265
00:32:36,939 --> 00:32:41,938
You're right. There is a section
on HIV-related discrimination.

266
00:32:42,139 --> 00:32:46,458
Thank you very much.

267
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:58,178
We do have
a private research room.

268
00:32:58,379 --> 00:33:04,219
- I'm fine right here.
- I'm looking for the Murdoch case.

269
00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:07,139
Just a moment.

270
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,459
Wouldn't you be more comfortable
in a research room?

271
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:48,100
No...
would it make you more comfortable?

272
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:57,899
Beckett, how are you doing?

273
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,140
Counsellor.

274
00:34:16,901 --> 00:34:20,101
Whatever, sir.

275
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,340
Excuse me.

276
00:34:36,181 --> 00:34:41,341
Who did you get?
Did you find a lawyer?

277
00:34:42,701 --> 00:34:45,940
I'm a lawyer.

278
00:34:46,381 --> 00:34:52,380
- How's your baby?
- She's... wonderful.

279
00:34:52,621 --> 00:34:56,301
- What's her name?
- Larice.

280
00:34:57,181 --> 00:35:01,861
- That's a beautiful name.
- We named her after my sister.

281
00:35:38,983 --> 00:35:41,902
Look...

282
00:35:45,503 --> 00:35:48,502
How did they find out you had AIDS?

283
00:35:48,663 --> 00:35:52,783
One of the partners
noticed a lesion on my forehead.

284
00:35:56,863 --> 00:36:00,382
But how...?

285
00:36:00,543 --> 00:36:06,223
How do you go from that,
which could have been anything,

286
00:36:06,383 --> 00:36:13,543
to deducing that you had AIDS
and terminating you on that basis?

287
00:36:14,263 --> 00:36:17,863
That's a good point.

288
00:36:25,064 --> 00:36:28,423
The partner who spotted the lesion,
Walter Kenton,

289
00:36:28,584 --> 00:36:32,543
worked for Walsh, Ulmer & Brahm
in D.C.

290
00:36:32,704 --> 00:36:38,543
A paralegal there, Melissa Benedict,
showed lesions on and off.

291
00:36:38,704 --> 00:36:42,383
It was common knowledge
that she had AIDS.

292
00:36:42,544 --> 00:36:47,384
- But they didn't fire her.
- No, they did not fire her.

293
00:36:47,584 --> 00:36:51,024
Have you got a relevant precedent?

294
00:36:51,184 --> 00:36:57,704
The Airline decision...
Supreme Court.

295
00:37:13,345 --> 00:37:16,864
"The Federal Rehabilitation Act
of 1973,

296
00:37:17,064 --> 00:37:21,224
prohibits discrimination
against handicapped persons

297
00:37:21,385 --> 00:37:25,424
if they can perform the duties
required of them".

298
00:37:25,584 --> 00:37:29,704
"Though the ruling did not specify
AIDS discrimination..."

299
00:37:29,865 --> 00:37:34,385
"subsequent decisions have held
that AIDS is a handicap

300
00:37:34,545 --> 00:37:38,064
because of the physical
limitations it imposes

301
00:37:38,225 --> 00:37:43,625
and the prejudice surrounding it,
which exacts a social death...

302
00:37:47,025 --> 00:37:52,265
that proceeds
the actual physical one".

303
00:37:59,546 --> 00:38:02,625
"This is the essence
of discrimination".

304
00:38:02,785 --> 00:38:07,305
"Formulating opinions about others
not based on their merits,

305
00:38:07,466 --> 00:38:12,385
but on their membership in a group
with the same characteristics".

306
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:42,825
- Charles wheeler.
- Julius Erving. Glad to see you.

307
00:38:42,986 --> 00:38:46,265
Ken Starr.

308
00:38:50,587 --> 00:38:53,626
It'll only take a minute.

309
00:38:53,906 --> 00:38:59,066
Charles wheeler. How are you doing?
A summons for you.

310
00:38:59,227 --> 00:39:03,426
Take a look at it.
Dr. J., you're the best.

311
00:39:03,587 --> 00:39:08,267
If you ever need a lawyer,
just give me a call.

312
00:39:08,427 --> 00:39:11,307
See you in court.

313
00:39:11,467 --> 00:39:14,147
You're the TV guy.

314
00:39:18,308 --> 00:39:20,267
What's up?

315
00:39:20,467 --> 00:39:24,946
I want to know everything
about Andy's personal life.

316
00:39:25,107 --> 00:39:28,547
Does he frequent
those pathetic bars?

317
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:32,867
What other homosexual facilities
does he go to?

318
00:39:33,027 --> 00:39:37,707
What deviant groups
does he secretly belong to?

319
00:39:37,868 --> 00:39:43,788
- What is it, Bob?
- Let's make a settlement offer.

320
00:39:45,388 --> 00:39:50,868
Andy brought AIDS into our offices,
into our men's room.

321
00:39:51,028 --> 00:39:55,347
He brought AIDS
to our annual family picnic!

322
00:39:55,508 --> 00:39:59,428
- We ought to be suing him.
- Show some compassion.

323
00:39:59,588 --> 00:40:02,147
We gave him Highline.

324
00:40:02,308 --> 00:40:08,307
Did Beckett say, "I won't be able to
function to the best of my ability?"

325
00:40:08,468 --> 00:40:12,308
Now, discarding the trust
I conferred upon him,

326
00:40:12,469 --> 00:40:16,548
Andrew Beckett proposes
to haul me into court.

327
00:40:16,709 --> 00:40:20,388
To sling accusations at me.
To call me a bigot...

328
00:40:20,549 --> 00:40:26,228
in full view of the Philadelphia
judicial establishment.

329
00:40:32,589 --> 00:40:35,948
Beckett doesn't want to go to court.

330
00:40:36,149 --> 00:40:41,068
- A jury might side with him.
- Wait a minute...

331
00:40:41,229 --> 00:40:45,749
He was fired for incompetence,
not because he has AIDS.

332
00:40:45,949 --> 00:40:51,149
- Did you know he was sick?
- Did you, Bob?

333
00:40:53,509 --> 00:40:56,269
No... not really.

334
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:13,149
Everybody,
this is the house that I grew up in.

335
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:16,750
Right here in
Lower Merion, Pennsylvania.

336
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:20,110
Here's proof.

337
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:25,550
There. My hand prints
from when I was a cute little boy.

338
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:31,029
Today is the 40th wedding
anniversary of my mom and dad.

339
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:38,070
- A tough life in all that poverty.
- Those can be some mean streets.

340
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:43,710
Here's the front door. I once
broke this finger in this door.

341
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:49,550
- Where's my brother?
- There's my sister Jill.

342
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:54,110
- Say hello, Alexis.
- Mommy's pregnant again.

343
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:56,630
Are you really?

344
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,590
- Hello, Meghan.
- Uncle Andy.

345
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:02,990
- Where's Dad?
- Fixing the snow blower.

346
00:42:03,151 --> 00:42:07,070
It snows once in seven years,
and Dad buys a new snow blower.

347
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:10,750
- How are you?
- Today's a good day.

348
00:42:10,911 --> 00:42:17,231
Meghan, you're doing a great job.
I've got to say hello to my sisters.

349
00:42:27,271 --> 00:42:30,110
Put me down!

350
00:42:51,471 --> 00:42:55,631
Parts of the trial
will be hard for you to hear,

351
00:42:55,792 --> 00:43:01,511
about my personal life.
And there's going to be publicity.

352
00:43:01,672 --> 00:43:07,111
- Do you want me to take her?
- No, she's fine.

353
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:13,712
I think it's great you're asking...
but this is really your call.

354
00:43:13,912 --> 00:43:16,631
Thanks, brother.

355
00:43:16,953 --> 00:43:21,952
You're my kid brother.
That's all that matters, okay?

356
00:43:23,513 --> 00:43:28,272
To be honest,
I'm worried about Mommy and Daddy.

357
00:43:28,473 --> 00:43:34,113
They've been through so much, and
there are some tough times ahead.

358
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:40,712
Andy, the way that you've
handled this whole thing...

359
00:43:40,873 --> 00:43:45,473
you and Miguel...
with so much courage...

360
00:43:45,673 --> 00:43:49,953
There's nothing
that anybody could say

361
00:43:50,113 --> 00:43:55,633
that could make us feel anything
but incredibly proud of you.

362
00:43:57,913 --> 00:44:01,992
I didn't raise my kids
to sit in the back of the bus.

363
00:44:02,153 --> 00:44:06,912
You get in there
and you fight for your rights.

364
00:44:07,073 --> 00:44:09,673
I love you guys.

365
00:44:34,834 --> 00:44:37,194
Ladies and gentlemen...

366
00:44:38,995 --> 00:44:43,474
Forget everything you've seen
on TV and in the movies.

367
00:44:43,634 --> 00:44:48,314
There will be no surprise witnesses
or tearful confessions.

368
00:44:48,514 --> 00:44:52,274
You're going to be presented
with a simple fact.

369
00:44:53,474 --> 00:44:56,274
Andrew Beckett was fired.

370
00:44:56,434 --> 00:45:00,994
You'll hear two explanations
for why he was fired.

371
00:45:01,914 --> 00:45:05,994
It is up to you
to sift through the facts

372
00:45:06,155 --> 00:45:10,154
until you determine
what you think to be the truth.

373
00:45:10,315 --> 00:45:16,235
Certain points must be proven.
One: Andrew Beckett was...

374
00:45:16,435 --> 00:45:19,875
is a brilliant lawyer.

375
00:45:20,035 --> 00:45:23,635
Two: Andrew Beckett,
has a debilitating disease.

376
00:45:23,835 --> 00:45:31,395
He made the legal choice to keep
this fact from his employers.

377
00:45:31,555 --> 00:45:38,155
Three: His employer discovered this.
The illness here is AIDS.

378
00:45:38,315 --> 00:45:42,075
Four: They panicked.

379
00:45:46,115 --> 00:45:49,875
They did what most of us
would like to do with AIDS.

380
00:45:50,036 --> 00:45:56,196
Get it and everybody who has it
as far away from us as possible.

381
00:45:57,956 --> 00:46:03,076
Such behaviour may seem reasonable
to you. It does to me.

382
00:46:03,236 --> 00:46:06,236
AIDS is an incurable disease.

383
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:13,236
But no matter what moral judgment
you make upon his employers,

384
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:18,636
the fact that Beckett was fired
because he had AIDS...

385
00:46:18,796 --> 00:46:22,796
means they broke the law.

386
00:46:27,116 --> 00:46:29,835
Fact:

387
00:46:31,756 --> 00:46:38,276
Andrew Beckett's performance
on the job varied from competent...

388
00:46:38,437 --> 00:46:42,437
to, often times, mediocre...

389
00:46:42,596 --> 00:46:46,996
to sometimes
flagrantly incompetent.

390
00:46:47,157 --> 00:46:49,717
Fact:

391
00:46:49,877 --> 00:46:54,477
He claims
he's the victim of lies and deceit.

392
00:46:55,157 --> 00:46:57,156
Fact:

393
00:46:57,317 --> 00:47:04,157
It was Andrew Beckett who lied
about his disease to his employers.

394
00:47:04,477 --> 00:47:06,476
Fact:

395
00:47:06,637 --> 00:47:11,917
He was successful in his duplicity.

396
00:47:12,078 --> 00:47:15,677
The partners at Wyant Wheeler
did not know

397
00:47:15,837 --> 00:47:20,196
that Andrew Beckett had AIDS
when they fired him.

398
00:47:22,078 --> 00:47:25,437
Fact:

399
00:47:25,598 --> 00:47:28,957
Andrew Beckett is dying.

400
00:47:33,478 --> 00:47:40,517
Fact:
Andrew Beckett is angry.

401
00:47:40,678 --> 00:47:48,877
His lifestyle and reckless behaviour
have cut short his life.

402
00:47:49,198 --> 00:47:54,718
In his anger and rage
he is lashing out.

403
00:47:55,399 --> 00:47:58,638
He wants someone to pay.

404
00:48:01,918 --> 00:48:04,438
Thank you.

405
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:23,239
Andrew Beckett represented
your firm in 1990, is that correct?

406
00:48:23,399 --> 00:48:27,438
- That's correct.
- Were you pleased with his work?

407
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,798
We were satisfied
with the outcome of the litigation.

408
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,560
Satisfied.

409
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:44,439
Mr. Laird, you gave me sworn
testimony in your deposition.

410
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:48,119
- Is that correct?
- Correct.

411
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:55,720
You said you were impressed
and delighted with Beckett's work.

412
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,520
Do you recall saying that?

413
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:11,000
In all honesty I was delighted
with aspects of Andy's efforts.

414
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:17,000
But in general, I found the work
to be merely satisfactory.

415
00:49:23,201 --> 00:49:26,960
Do you agree...

416
00:49:27,441 --> 00:49:30,960
that a baloney sandwich
is a satisfactory meal?

417
00:49:31,121 --> 00:49:37,561
Whereas, caviar and champagne,
roast duck and baked Alaska...

418
00:49:37,721 --> 00:49:40,560
might be considered delightful?

419
00:49:40,721 --> 00:49:45,720
We object. These gastronomical
comments are irrelevant.

420
00:49:45,921 --> 00:49:51,841
Five months ago you characterized
Andrew Beckett as caviar.

421
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:54,921
Now he's a baloney sandwich.

422
00:49:55,081 --> 00:50:00,761
What powerful force
caused this change of mind?

423
00:50:02,401 --> 00:50:06,961
He hasn't changed his mind.
He's amplified his answer.

424
00:50:07,121 --> 00:50:09,841
Objection sustained.

425
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:23,161
Mr. Laird, explain this to me
like I'm a four-year-old.

426
00:50:23,321 --> 00:50:27,000
Did Andrew Beckett
win your lawsuit for you?

427
00:50:27,602 --> 00:50:33,682
- Yes, we won.
- Congratulations, what a...

428
00:50:33,882 --> 00:50:37,002
satisfactory experience.

429
00:51:04,003 --> 00:51:06,442
Ready, Mr. Beckett.

430
00:51:12,682 --> 00:51:15,602
Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve!

431
00:51:17,082 --> 00:51:20,002
Do you see this
as a gay-rights issue?

432
00:51:20,523 --> 00:51:24,043
I am not political.
I just want what is fair.

433
00:51:24,203 --> 00:51:26,403
You are gay?

434
00:51:26,563 --> 00:51:30,563
That's none of your business,
but yes, I am.

435
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:36,683
Do homosexuals
deserve special treatment?

436
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:38,963
Hell no!

437
00:51:39,163 --> 00:51:43,003
Philadelphia
is the city of brotherly love.

438
00:51:43,163 --> 00:51:46,442
The Declaration of Independence
was signed here.

439
00:51:46,644 --> 00:51:48,683
That document says:

440
00:51:48,883 --> 00:51:53,643
"All men are created equal".

441
00:51:54,803 --> 00:51:57,963
Give me a break.

442
00:51:59,084 --> 00:52:05,524
- We scorn discriminatory practices.
- Thank you, Mayor.

443
00:52:05,684 --> 00:52:10,804
You're not getting a little light
in the sneakers, are you, pal?

444
00:52:20,524 --> 00:52:25,123
Yeah, I am, Filko. I'm changing.

445
00:52:25,324 --> 00:52:27,763
I'm on the prowl.

446
00:52:27,965 --> 00:52:32,564
And I'm looking for a hunk.
A real man... like you.

447
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:37,244
You know what we do.
You want to play sailor?

448
00:52:37,484 --> 00:52:40,644
- Columbus and the first mate.
- That's not funny!

449
00:52:40,805 --> 00:52:45,804
These people make me sick...
but the law's been broken.

450
00:52:45,964 --> 00:52:49,243
You remember the law, don't you?

451
00:52:53,645 --> 00:52:57,525
- At least we agree on one thing.
- What's that?

452
00:52:58,525 --> 00:53:02,125
Tutti-frutti make me sick, too.

453
00:53:07,245 --> 00:53:11,245
Ms. Benedict, you worked
for Walsh, Ulmer & Brahm.

454
00:53:11,405 --> 00:53:15,925
- At the same time as Walter Kenton?
- That's correct.

455
00:53:16,086 --> 00:53:21,485
He knew the lesions on your face
and arms were caused by AIDS?

456
00:53:21,645 --> 00:53:24,725
Definitely, I told all the partners.

457
00:53:24,886 --> 00:53:28,885
How did Walter Kenton
treat you after that?

458
00:53:29,045 --> 00:53:33,725
Every time we met,
he'd get this look on his face.

459
00:53:33,886 --> 00:53:39,406
The "Oh God!" expression. As in,
"Oh God, that woman has AIDS".

460
00:53:40,405 --> 00:53:43,605
Thank you. No more questions.

461
00:53:43,966 --> 00:53:47,806
Ms. Benedict,
how did you contract AIDS?

462
00:53:47,966 --> 00:53:51,806
Through a transfusion
just after childbirth.

463
00:53:51,966 --> 00:53:57,246
So it was not your behaviour
which caused you to be infected.

464
00:53:57,406 --> 00:54:00,526
You were unable to avoid it.

465
00:54:02,887 --> 00:54:05,886
I guess.

466
00:54:09,607 --> 00:54:11,606
Thank you.

467
00:54:11,767 --> 00:54:16,366
But I don't consider myself
different to anyone else with AIDS.

468
00:54:16,527 --> 00:54:21,367
I'm not guilty. I'm not innocent.
I'm just trying to survive.

469
00:54:21,527 --> 00:54:26,366
Thank you, Ms. Benedict.
No further questions at this time.

470
00:54:27,487 --> 00:54:31,247
You may step down, Ms. Benedict.

471
00:54:32,047 --> 00:54:37,967
Apart from the marks on his face,
were there other things

472
00:54:38,128 --> 00:54:41,887
that made you suspect he had AIDS?

473
00:54:42,087 --> 00:54:47,406
He was thin and he seemed tired,
but he was working so hard.

474
00:54:47,568 --> 00:54:49,928
Something was wrong.

475
00:54:50,127 --> 00:54:54,287
They're trying to pretend
that they didn't notice anything.

476
00:54:54,448 --> 00:54:58,607
- Objection.
- Just answer the question.

477
00:54:58,767 --> 00:55:03,686
Have you ever felt discriminated
against at Wyant Wheeler?

478
00:55:04,608 --> 00:55:07,567
- Yes.
- In what way?

479
00:55:07,728 --> 00:55:10,967
Mr. Wheeler's secretary Lydia

480
00:55:11,128 --> 00:55:15,408
said that Mr. Wheeler
had a problem with my earrings.

481
00:55:15,568 --> 00:55:21,407
Apparently Mr. Wheeler felt
that they were too "ethnic".

482
00:55:21,608 --> 00:55:26,727
She told me he'd like something
a little less garish...

483
00:55:26,888 --> 00:55:32,887
- Something more "American".
- What did you say?

484
00:55:33,048 --> 00:55:37,728
I said, "My earrings are American.
They're African-American".

485
00:55:40,929 --> 00:55:45,008
- Let's have order, please.
- No more questions.

486
00:55:45,169 --> 00:55:49,928
Ms. Burton,
weren't you recently promoted?

487
00:55:50,089 --> 00:55:54,408
Yes, I'm in charge
of the paralegal department.

488
00:55:56,129 --> 00:56:00,529
Congratulations on your unfettered
success at Wyant Wheeler.

489
00:56:00,689 --> 00:56:03,569
Unfettered?

490
00:56:03,729 --> 00:56:06,848
I don't understand this.

491
00:56:07,009 --> 00:56:13,088
The promotion of an obviously
intelligent, articulate...

492
00:56:13,249 --> 00:56:18,168
qualified
African-American woman

493
00:56:18,329 --> 00:56:22,528
in a firm which practices
wanton discrimination.

494
00:56:22,689 --> 00:56:28,089
- That is what's claimed here.
- I can't explain it.

495
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:34,489
Could it be that
these instances of discrimination

496
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:41,209
are in fact misunderstandings that
have been blown out of proportion?

497
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:47,050
I think counsel tends
to oversimplify the issue.

498
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:53,129
Thank you, Ms. Burton,
I'll take that into consideration.

499
00:57:11,851 --> 00:57:14,051
How's the trial going?

500
00:57:14,211 --> 00:57:17,730
I saw you on TV.
I'm a law student at Penn.

501
00:57:17,891 --> 00:57:22,171
You saw me on TV?
It's a good school, Penn.

502
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:26,370
I'm in my second year.
I just wanted to tell you

503
00:57:26,531 --> 00:57:31,970
this case is extremely important.
You're doing a fantastic job.

504
00:57:36,051 --> 00:57:38,891
When you graduate, call me.

505
00:57:39,051 --> 00:57:43,330
Thank you very much.
Listen, Joe...

506
00:57:44,171 --> 00:57:51,811
- Would you like to get a beer?
- No, my wife is...

507
00:57:52,011 --> 00:57:56,770
I don't pick up people
in drug stores every day.

508
00:58:03,852 --> 00:58:07,211
- Do you think I'm gay?
- Aren't you?

509
00:58:07,372 --> 00:58:12,811
- Do I look gay to you?
- Do I look gay to you?

510
00:58:13,371 --> 00:58:16,650
- Relax.
- I ought to kick your faggoty ass.

511
00:58:16,812 --> 00:58:19,732
Take it as a compliment.

512
00:58:22,132 --> 00:58:27,051
That is exactly the kind of bullshit
that makes people hate your...

513
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:29,332
faggoty asses.

514
00:58:29,492 --> 00:58:35,412
- You try and kick my ass, asshole.
- No, you're the asshole, buddy!

515
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:45,172
Continue, Ms. O'Hara.

516
00:58:45,372 --> 00:58:50,652
We were going crazy
looking for this complaint.

517
00:58:50,812 --> 00:58:55,932
Mr. Beckett was screaming.
He looked so freaky.

518
00:58:56,093 --> 00:59:01,733
Mr. Kenton kept saying,
"You lost the Highline complaint!"

519
00:59:01,893 --> 00:59:05,892
All of a sudden,
Jamey comes in with the complaint.

520
00:59:06,053 --> 00:59:10,972
- He says "It was in Central Files!"
- Central Files?

521
00:59:11,133 --> 00:59:16,373
That's where files are sent
when cases are closed.

522
00:59:16,533 --> 00:59:23,492
Jamey got to the court just in time.
Everybody was completely wasted.

523
00:59:26,133 --> 00:59:32,733
Mr. Beckett just kept saying,
"I'm sorry. I don't understand".

524
00:59:33,454 --> 00:59:35,813
Thank you.

525
00:59:36,014 --> 00:59:38,894
No further questions.

526
00:59:39,414 --> 00:59:41,534
Mr. Miller.

527
00:59:48,374 --> 00:59:51,373
- May I?
- Certainly.

528
00:59:59,894 --> 01:00:02,173
Thank you.

529
01:00:02,334 --> 01:00:04,454
Are you okay?

530
01:00:04,855 --> 01:00:08,214
- Do you want a glass of water?
- No.

531
01:00:11,734 --> 01:00:16,255
- Was Andy a good boss?
- Yes.

532
01:00:16,414 --> 01:00:19,374
He was very sweet.

533
01:00:20,455 --> 01:00:25,774
How would you characterize
his work as an attorney?

534
01:00:25,975 --> 01:00:29,734
How would I know?
I just worked for him.

535
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:35,294
Excuse me, Your Honour,
is this for the record?

536
01:00:35,495 --> 01:00:40,655
Mr. Miller, perhaps you should
return to counsel's table.

537
01:00:51,255 --> 01:00:54,095
Ms. O'Hara...

538
01:00:54,255 --> 01:00:57,615
Were you aware of any problems

539
01:00:57,776 --> 01:01:03,416
- That the senior partners had
with Andrew's work prior to this?

540
01:01:04,616 --> 01:01:10,376
- No, I wasn't.
- Thank you. No more questions.

541
01:01:15,416 --> 01:01:23,416
- Was Mr. Beckett forgetful?
- Not to my knowledge. No.

542
01:01:23,576 --> 01:01:28,575
How would you go about
making a lawyer look incompetent?

543
01:01:28,736 --> 01:01:32,176
Hiding an important document
for a few hours?

544
01:01:32,377 --> 01:01:35,736
Making it look like
the responsible lawyer misplaced it?

545
01:01:35,937 --> 01:01:41,496
Would the partners do that
if they found out Andy was sick?

546
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:43,775
Perhaps.

547
01:01:43,936 --> 01:01:50,495
We've had lawyers who've had
heart attacks, ulcers, cancer...

548
01:01:50,656 --> 01:01:54,936
Did you have something to do with
this file being lost accidentally?

549
01:01:55,097 --> 01:01:59,856
- Objection.
- Did you misplace this file?

550
01:02:00,057 --> 01:02:04,656
- Absolutely not.
- Are you a homosexual?

551
01:02:04,857 --> 01:02:09,377
Answer the question.
Are you a homo? A faggot?

552
01:02:09,537 --> 01:02:15,857
You know, a queen? A fairy?
Rump-roaster? Are you gay?

553
01:02:16,017 --> 01:02:18,297
Objection!

554
01:02:18,458 --> 01:02:21,657
Counsel's attacking his own witness.

555
01:02:21,817 --> 01:02:27,136
Mr. Collin's sexual orientation
has nothing to do with this case.

556
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:31,096
Please have a seat, Ms. Conine.

557
01:02:33,577 --> 01:02:37,617
Approach the bench, Mr. Miller.

558
01:02:47,458 --> 01:02:52,458
Kindly share with me exactly
what's going on in your head.

559
01:02:52,618 --> 01:02:56,697
Because I haven't a clue.

560
01:02:59,498 --> 01:03:03,098
Your Honour...

561
01:03:03,298 --> 01:03:09,137
Everybody in this room is thinking
about sexual orientation.

562
01:03:09,298 --> 01:03:12,377
Sexual preference, whatever.

563
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:16,578
Who does what to whom,
and how they do it.

564
01:03:16,739 --> 01:03:19,818
They're thinking
about Andrew Beckett.

565
01:03:19,978 --> 01:03:23,657
Mr. Wheeler, Ms. Conine,
even you, Your Honour.

566
01:03:23,859 --> 01:03:26,499
They're wondering.

567
01:03:26,658 --> 01:03:32,578
I know they're thinking about me.
Let's get it out in the open...

568
01:03:32,739 --> 01:03:38,299
out of the closet.
This case isn't just about AIDS.

569
01:03:38,459 --> 01:03:42,659
Let's talk about
what this case is really all about.

570
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:48,098
The general public's loathing,
hatred and fear of homosexuals.

571
01:03:48,259 --> 01:03:54,898
And how that hatred translated
into the firing of this homosexual.

572
01:03:55,059 --> 01:03:59,219
My client. Andrew Beckett.

573
01:03:59,379 --> 01:04:02,979
Please have a seat, Mr. Miller.

574
01:04:06,899 --> 01:04:09,019
Very good.

575
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:16,019
In this court, justice is blind
to matters of race, creed, colour,

576
01:04:16,179 --> 01:04:19,178
and sexual orientation.

577
01:04:19,739 --> 01:04:23,179
With all due respect,
Your Honour...

578
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:27,380
We don't live in this courtroom,
do we?

579
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:35,099
No, but with regard to this witness,
I'll sustain the objection.

580
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:42,379
How many weeks at a time
would you be out to sea?

581
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:46,060
Anywhere from two weeks
to several months.

582
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:52,580
- Any women on board?
- Not when I was in the Navy.

583
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:59,900
During these long voyages,
no women in sight...

584
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:04,220
Hundreds of hard working,
robust young men in their prime...

585
01:05:04,381 --> 01:05:10,541
At the peak of their
natural appetites and desires...

586
01:05:10,701 --> 01:05:14,380
- Anything going on?
- Like what?

587
01:05:14,541 --> 01:05:18,701
Like two sailors down below
making flippy-flop.

588
01:05:18,861 --> 01:05:21,461
Objection.

589
01:05:21,981 --> 01:05:24,340
There was one.

590
01:05:24,541 --> 01:05:28,060
- Objection.
- Continue, Mr. Miller.

591
01:05:28,261 --> 01:05:32,141
You mean a homosexual?

592
01:05:32,301 --> 01:05:38,141
He strutted around naked
trying to be noticed. It was sick.

593
01:05:38,341 --> 01:05:44,181
It was destroying our morale.
We let him know what we thought.

594
01:05:44,342 --> 01:05:50,181
- Did you write him a letter?
- We stuck his head in a latrine.

595
01:05:50,342 --> 01:05:56,341
You taught him a lesson. Just like
firing Beckett taught him a lesson.

596
01:05:56,542 --> 01:06:02,381
- You knew Ms. Benedict had AIDS?
- She didn't try to conceal it.

597
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:06,782
So you know the difference
between a bruise and a lesion?

598
01:06:06,942 --> 01:06:09,982
Beckett told me
he'd been hit by a ball.

599
01:06:10,143 --> 01:06:14,422
How did hearing of Ms. Benedict's
illness affect you?

600
01:06:14,582 --> 01:06:20,222
She said that you were repulsed
by her and avoided her.

601
01:06:20,383 --> 01:06:26,382
I feel nothing but the deepest
sympathy for people like Melissa,

602
01:06:26,543 --> 01:06:32,382
Who contracted this disease
through no fault of their own.

603
01:06:44,143 --> 01:06:47,262
Andy, don't move now.

604
01:07:06,104 --> 01:07:10,303
It's not going through.

605
01:07:11,704 --> 01:07:15,783
We may have to flush it out again.

606
01:07:19,944 --> 01:07:22,983
The vein's closed.

607
01:07:23,143 --> 01:07:27,703
- We'd better call Barbara.
- Nurse Ratchett?

608
01:07:27,864 --> 01:07:32,944
Tell her to come over.

609
01:07:36,824 --> 01:07:42,663
There's so much stuff
I need to get done.

610
01:07:42,824 --> 01:07:46,343
Can't we just skip
treatment for tonight?

611
01:07:46,504 --> 01:07:50,583
No, we are not skipping
this treatment.

612
01:07:50,744 --> 01:07:56,583
It's my arm and my treatment,
and I say skip it.

613
01:08:05,185 --> 01:08:07,945
You know something?

614
01:08:08,105 --> 01:08:12,784
- That stuff is saving your life.
- What's the matter with you?

615
01:08:12,945 --> 01:08:16,025
- Close the law book.
- Let me...

616
01:08:26,745 --> 01:08:31,344
The least you can do
is look at me

617
01:08:31,505 --> 01:08:36,104
and give me
a little of your time. Got it?

618
01:08:36,265 --> 01:08:44,225
You are worried we don't have
very much time left, aren't you?

619
01:08:44,385 --> 01:08:46,745
No.

620
01:09:01,426 --> 01:09:04,225
I'll tell you what...

621
01:09:04,386 --> 01:09:12,706
We'll plan my memorial service
and prepare for the inevitable.

622
01:09:16,306 --> 01:09:19,985
Maybe you should think about it.

623
01:09:36,987 --> 01:09:39,546
No.

624
01:09:47,027 --> 01:09:51,267
No... I've got a better idea.

625
01:10:06,147 --> 01:10:09,587
Hi, Andrew. Hi, Miguel.

626
01:10:09,787 --> 01:10:15,107
Joe Miller...
Lisa, nice to meet you!

627
01:10:15,267 --> 01:10:20,427
This is Miguel's sister. Maria.

628
01:10:22,388 --> 01:10:27,307
- Would you like a drink?
- I'll take care of Joe.

629
01:10:27,508 --> 01:10:34,828
- You're looking... alive tonight.
- I had a blood transfusion.

630
01:10:35,028 --> 01:10:39,868
Do you like it? I'm a lawsuit.

631
01:10:40,028 --> 01:10:45,027
- Not bad. What are you drinking?
- Wine is good.

632
01:10:45,228 --> 01:10:48,907
Could I have some of the red?

633
01:10:49,389 --> 01:10:57,428
- I've got some questions for you.
- I'm at a party right now.

634
01:10:57,588 --> 01:11:00,267
We'll get to it later.

635
01:11:00,428 --> 01:11:03,228
Hi, Joe Miller.

636
01:11:03,389 --> 01:11:07,828
- Do I know you?
- Mona Lisa.

637
01:11:07,989 --> 01:11:12,309
- Lawsuit.
- Nice. Have fun.

638
01:12:50,191 --> 01:12:52,230
Thank you.

639
01:13:01,191 --> 01:13:05,350
- Congratulations, counsellor.
- With what?

640
01:13:05,511 --> 01:13:11,431
You survived what I presume to be
your first gay party, intact.

641
01:13:15,431 --> 01:13:20,030
When you're brought up
the way most people are,

642
01:13:20,191 --> 01:13:26,271
there's not a lot of discussion
about homosexuality.

643
01:13:26,911 --> 01:13:29,910
As a kid you're taught
that queers are funny.

644
01:13:30,071 --> 01:13:36,231
Queers dress up like their mother.
That they're a danger to kids.

645
01:13:36,432 --> 01:13:41,952
And that all they want to do
is get into your pants.

646
01:13:42,112 --> 01:13:47,432
That pretty much sums up
the general thinking out there.

647
01:13:47,592 --> 01:13:53,592
- Thanks for sharing that with me.
- Let's go over this testimony.

648
01:13:55,632 --> 01:13:58,552
First, I'll ask you:

649
01:13:58,712 --> 01:14:03,872
Can you describe the circumstances
in which you joined Wyant Wheeler?

650
01:14:04,033 --> 01:14:06,752
Miller?

651
01:14:07,632 --> 01:14:11,552
Do you ever pray?

652
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:17,632
That's not the answer I want.
But, yes, I pray.

653
01:14:17,833 --> 01:14:23,832
- What do you pray for?
- I pray that...

654
01:14:24,033 --> 01:14:29,953
I pray that my baby is healthy.
I prayed at her delivery.

655
01:14:30,153 --> 01:14:35,353
I pray the Phillies win the pennant.
Now can we get to the questions?

656
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:42,033
Can you describe the circumstances
in which you joined Wyant Wheeler?

657
01:14:42,193 --> 01:14:48,273
- Can you do that?
- I may miss the end of this trial.

658
01:14:48,673 --> 01:14:51,313
Yes, I've considered that.

659
01:14:51,474 --> 01:14:57,114
I've made some provisions in my will
for some charities.

660
01:14:57,273 --> 01:15:02,993
- Miguel will need a lawyer.
- I know a good probate.

661
01:15:03,154 --> 01:15:06,433
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

662
01:15:06,594 --> 01:15:12,993
Can you describe the circumstances
in which you joined Wyant Wheeler?

663
01:15:17,714 --> 01:15:20,514
Do you like opera?

664
01:15:24,514 --> 01:15:28,394
I'm not that familiar with opera.

665
01:15:30,835 --> 01:15:33,715
This is my favourite aria.

666
01:15:34,555 --> 01:15:37,514
This is Maria Callas.

667
01:15:38,515 --> 01:15:41,435
This is "Andrea Chenier".

668
01:15:42,595 --> 01:15:46,355
Umberto Giordano.

669
01:15:47,914 --> 01:15:51,074
This is Madeleine.

670
01:15:51,915 --> 01:15:54,835
She's saying how...

671
01:15:54,995 --> 01:16:01,914
...during the French Revolution
a mob set fire to her house.

672
01:16:02,075 --> 01:16:07,475
And her mother died... saving her.

673
01:16:07,636 --> 01:16:12,395
"Look, the place that
cradled me is burning".

674
01:16:24,316 --> 01:16:28,316
Can you hear
the heartache in her voice?

675
01:16:28,915 --> 01:16:32,075
Can you feel it, Joe?

676
01:16:37,596 --> 01:16:42,515
In come the strings
and it changes everything.

677
01:16:42,716 --> 01:16:46,716
The music fills with a hope.

678
01:16:49,516 --> 01:16:53,036
And that'll change again. Listen.

679
01:16:55,756 --> 01:16:58,035
Listen.

680
01:17:00,837 --> 01:17:04,436
"I bring sorrow
to those who love me".

681
01:17:04,596 --> 01:17:08,196
Oh, that single cello.

682
01:17:16,197 --> 01:17:21,516
"It was during this sorrow
that love came to me".

683
01:17:27,917 --> 01:17:32,397
"A voice filled with harmony".

684
01:17:33,597 --> 01:17:37,516
"It said, live still".

685
01:17:39,437 --> 01:17:43,277
"I am life".

686
01:17:43,918 --> 01:17:46,877
"Heaven is in your eyes".

687
01:18:28,158 --> 01:18:32,757
"Is everything around you
just the blood and mud?"

688
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:36,398
"I am divine".

689
01:18:36,598 --> 01:18:40,358
"I am oblivion".

690
01:18:41,239 --> 01:18:45,759
"I am the god...

691
01:18:46,358 --> 01:18:52,758
that comes down from the heavens
and makes of the earth a heaven".

692
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:07,958
"I am love!"

693
01:19:08,759 --> 01:19:12,438
"I am love".

694
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:32,919
I'd better get out of here.

695
01:19:33,839 --> 01:19:38,279
Lisa... I told her that...

696
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:45,120
- I'll look over the Q & A.
- No, you're ready.

697
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:24,560
Jesus...

698
01:20:48,481 --> 01:20:50,601
God!

699
01:21:32,443 --> 01:21:35,882
I love you, little Larice.

700
01:23:11,284 --> 01:23:14,044
Left hand on the Bible.

701
01:23:14,205 --> 01:23:17,564
Do you swear to tell the truth?

702
01:23:17,724 --> 01:23:20,764
- I do.
- Please be seated.

703
01:23:24,045 --> 01:23:26,484
Andrew...

704
01:23:26,645 --> 01:23:34,205
Can you describe the circumstances
in which you joined Wyant Wheeler?

705
01:23:34,404 --> 01:23:39,004
Wyant Wheeler
aggressively recruited me.

706
01:23:39,205 --> 01:23:46,605
The were a very prestigious firm.
I was impressed with the partners.

707
01:23:46,765 --> 01:23:50,125
- Including Charles wheeler?
- Particularly Charles.

708
01:23:50,325 --> 01:23:56,085
- What impressed you?
- The kind of lawyer he was.

709
01:23:56,245 --> 01:24:03,725
- What kind was that?
- One of great legal knowledge.

710
01:24:03,885 --> 01:24:09,645
A genuine leader. Gifted at
bringing out the best in others.

711
01:24:09,805 --> 01:24:16,125
An awesome ability to illuminate
complex legal problems

712
01:24:16,326 --> 01:24:21,325
to a colleague, a courtroom,
to the man on the street.

713
01:24:21,486 --> 01:24:27,726
The kind of man who can play three
sets of tennis but doesn't sweat.

714
01:24:27,926 --> 01:24:34,605
Underneath an elegant surface
he has an adventurous spirit.

715
01:24:35,846 --> 01:24:41,286
Did you ever tell Charles wheeler
you were gay?

716
01:24:41,646 --> 01:24:45,086
- No, I didn't.
- Why not?

717
01:24:45,287 --> 01:24:50,206
In a law firm you're not really
supposed to have a personal life.

718
01:24:50,406 --> 01:24:54,765
I did plan
to tell Charles eventually.

719
01:24:54,926 --> 01:24:59,046
But then something happened
at the racquet club.

720
01:24:59,207 --> 01:25:02,567
About three years ago.

721
01:25:02,767 --> 01:25:06,726
Somebody started telling jokes.

722
01:25:09,446 --> 01:25:14,046
What do you call a woman who
has PMS and ESP at the same time?

723
01:25:14,207 --> 01:25:18,806
- I don't know.
- A bitch who knows everything.

724
01:25:19,007 --> 01:25:21,887
Sounds like somebody I know.

725
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:29,967
- How does a faggot fake an orgasm?
- He throws hot yogurt on your back.

726
01:25:32,848 --> 01:25:36,968
- How did that make you feel?
- Relieved...

727
01:25:37,128 --> 01:25:42,967
that I never told him I was gay.
Just very relieved.

728
01:25:44,167 --> 01:25:50,967
- Are you a good lawyer?
- I'm an excellent lawyer.

729
01:25:51,128 --> 01:25:55,648
- What makes you that?
- I love the law.

730
01:25:55,807 --> 01:25:59,567
I know the law.
I excel at practicing it.

731
01:25:59,728 --> 01:26:06,367
- What do you love about the law?
- Many things.

732
01:26:06,528 --> 01:26:11,288
What do I love most about the law?

733
01:26:12,688 --> 01:26:18,448
Every now and again,
not often, but occasionally,

734
01:26:18,648 --> 01:26:25,128
- You get to be a part
of justice being done.

735
01:26:27,368 --> 01:26:32,287
It really is quite a thrill
when that happens.

736
01:26:37,248 --> 01:26:40,688
Thank you, Andrew.

737
01:26:43,049 --> 01:26:49,608
You said earlier you aspired to be
a person of adventurous spirit.

738
01:26:49,769 --> 01:26:53,048
- Is that correct?
- Something like that.

739
01:26:53,209 --> 01:27:00,609
- Do you take risks?
- In this job you have to.

740
01:27:04,129 --> 01:27:08,289
Did your doctor ever tell you
to reduce stress?

741
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:15,929
That long hours at work
might speed up your illness?

742
01:27:16,609 --> 01:27:22,009
My doctor mentioned
the impact AIDS... Excuse me...

743
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:27,089
My doctor mentioned the impact
of stress on the immune system.

744
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:34,169
Have you ever been to the
Stallion Showcase Cinema?

745
01:27:43,850 --> 01:27:47,290
I've been to...

746
01:27:47,451 --> 01:27:50,090
that...

747
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:56,249
I've been to that theatre
three times in my life.

748
01:27:56,451 --> 01:28:00,691
- What type of movies do they show?
- Gay movies.

749
01:28:00,851 --> 01:28:04,451
- Gay pornographic movies?
- Yes.

750
01:28:04,651 --> 01:28:07,851
Objection, Your Honour.

751
01:28:08,011 --> 01:28:13,290
This kind of questioning is vital
to the issue of credibility.

752
01:28:13,451 --> 01:28:17,211
Let's see where this is going.

753
01:28:17,371 --> 01:28:19,411
Continue, counsellor.

754
01:28:19,611 --> 01:28:26,170
- Do men have sex there?
- Some men.

755
01:28:26,491 --> 01:28:30,371
Have you ever had sex
with anyone in that theatre?

756
01:28:30,531 --> 01:28:33,571
- I'm Robert.
- Andy.

757
01:28:33,731 --> 01:28:37,171
Yes, once.

758
01:28:37,772 --> 01:28:42,452
Approximately what year
did that event take place?

759
01:28:44,531 --> 01:28:48,771
I guess it was 1984...

760
01:28:48,931 --> 01:28:51,930
84 or 85.

761
01:28:52,091 --> 01:28:58,011
Were you aware in 1984
of the fatal disease called AIDS?

762
01:28:58,172 --> 01:29:03,012
And that you could contract it
through sexual activity?

763
01:29:03,212 --> 01:29:08,131
I'd heard of something...

764
01:29:09,252 --> 01:29:12,772
The gay plague.
The gay cancer.

765
01:29:12,932 --> 01:29:19,732
We didn't know how you could get it
or that it killed you.

766
01:29:20,652 --> 01:29:24,492
Do you need a break, Mr. Beckett?

767
01:29:24,653 --> 01:29:28,852
No... I could use some water.

768
01:29:29,012 --> 01:29:33,692
John, would you bring
Mr. Beckett some water, please?

769
01:29:35,813 --> 01:29:40,652
While you were at Wyant Wheeler,
you did hide the fact

770
01:29:40,813 --> 01:29:44,933
that you were an active
homosexual, is that correct?

771
01:29:45,093 --> 01:29:50,932
No. That's not correct.
I never lied about it.

772
01:29:56,853 --> 01:30:04,253
As a homosexual, one is often
forced to conceal one's sexuality.

773
01:30:04,413 --> 01:30:08,853
- Isn't that right?
- In some circumstances, yes.

774
01:30:09,013 --> 01:30:14,853
You have spent your life pretending
to be something that you're not.

775
01:30:15,014 --> 01:30:19,773
- Concealment and dishonesty...
- I object.

776
01:30:19,974 --> 01:30:22,574
I'll withdraw it.

777
01:30:22,733 --> 01:30:30,293
Were you living with
Miguel Alvarez in 1984,

778
01:30:30,494 --> 01:30:33,014
when you had your...

779
01:30:33,174 --> 01:30:38,454
anonymous sexual encounter
in the porn theatre?

780
01:30:38,614 --> 01:30:40,653
Yes.

781
01:30:41,614 --> 01:30:48,253
- So you could have infected him?
- Miguel has not been infected.

782
01:30:48,414 --> 01:30:54,734
You didn't answer my question.
Could you have infected him?

783
01:30:58,014 --> 01:31:00,134
Yes.

784
01:31:00,334 --> 01:31:06,893
You say the lesions on your face
were clearly visible.

785
01:31:07,054 --> 01:31:09,093
That's right.

786
01:31:09,295 --> 01:31:13,374
Is it your contention that when
the partners saw these lesions,

787
01:31:13,535 --> 01:31:18,935
- they leapt to the conclusion
you had AIDS and they fired you?

788
01:31:20,295 --> 01:31:24,054
As painful as it is...

789
01:31:24,215 --> 01:31:30,615
to accuse my colleagues
of such reprehensible behaviour...

790
01:31:30,775 --> 01:31:35,095
it is the only conclusion
I could come to.

791
01:31:35,256 --> 01:31:39,575
Do you have any lesions on your face
at this time?

792
01:31:40,135 --> 01:31:46,534
One, here... by my ear.

793
01:31:47,576 --> 01:31:52,335
- May I approach the witness?
- Yes, you may.

794
01:32:03,016 --> 01:32:07,456
Remembering that you're under oath,
answering truthfully...

795
01:32:07,616 --> 01:32:13,136
Can you see the lesions on your face
in this mirror from three feet away?

796
01:32:13,296 --> 01:32:17,336
Answering truthfully.

797
01:32:25,057 --> 01:32:29,737
At the time I was fired,
the lesions were much bigger.

798
01:32:29,936 --> 01:32:34,336
Answer my question, please.

799
01:32:36,776 --> 01:32:41,856
No, I can't really see them.

800
01:32:43,777 --> 01:32:47,657
No more questions.

801
01:32:47,856 --> 01:32:52,376
We'll take a break now.
We'll reconvene in the morning.

802
01:32:52,537 --> 01:32:54,817
I hate this case.

803
01:32:55,017 --> 01:33:02,497
- I'd like five minutes in redirect.
- Mr. Beckett, can you go on?

804
01:33:02,697 --> 01:33:05,337
Three minutes.

805
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:09,097
May I borrow your mirror, please?

806
01:33:09,498 --> 01:33:12,378
Andrew...

807
01:33:14,337 --> 01:33:18,177
Do you have any lesions
on your body

808
01:33:18,337 --> 01:33:24,257
that resemble the lesions you had
on your face when you were fired?

809
01:33:24,418 --> 01:33:28,737
Yes, on my torso.

810
01:33:28,897 --> 01:33:33,577
I would like to ask Andrew
to remove his shirt

811
01:33:33,778 --> 01:33:37,297
so we can all
see what we're talking about.

812
01:33:37,458 --> 01:33:41,777
Objection. It would
unfairly influence the jury.

813
01:33:41,938 --> 01:33:45,938
If Andrew's illness forced him
to use a wheelchair,

814
01:33:46,098 --> 01:33:50,857
would he have to park it outside
so as not to influence the jury?

815
01:33:51,018 --> 01:33:55,298
This is AIDS.
Let's see what we're talking about.

816
01:33:55,459 --> 01:34:01,698
I'll allow it.
Please remove your shirt.

817
01:34:11,258 --> 01:34:17,418
- God, what a nightmare.
- He asked for it.

818
01:34:57,020 --> 01:35:04,739
- Can you see these lesions?
- Yes.

819
01:35:05,979 --> 01:35:08,539
Thank you.

820
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:22,060
- Do you swear to tell the truth?
- I do.

821
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:25,179
Please be seated.

822
01:35:32,261 --> 01:35:37,461
Mr. Wheeler, were you aware
that Andrew Beckett had AIDS

823
01:35:37,621 --> 01:35:41,940
at the time of his departure
from Wyant Wheeler?

824
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:45,260
- No.
- For absolute clarity...

825
01:35:45,421 --> 01:35:50,621
Did you fire Andrew Beckett
because he had AIDS?

826
01:35:50,781 --> 01:35:55,220
No, I did not fire Andrew Beckett
because he had AIDS.

827
01:35:55,541 --> 01:36:00,141
Can you explain in a way
that leaves no doubt

828
01:36:00,341 --> 01:36:05,260
why you promoted
Andrew Beckett in your firm?

829
01:36:05,461 --> 01:36:11,540
And then, most importantly,
why you asked him to leave?

830
01:36:13,982 --> 01:36:20,221
If you're the owner of a ball club,
you recruit the hot rookie.

831
01:36:20,422 --> 01:36:29,862
Andy was tremendously promising.
Fresh out of Penn. Crackerjack.

832
01:36:30,022 --> 01:36:37,822
That's why we hired him,
and why we stuck by him for so long.

833
01:36:38,062 --> 01:36:43,982
Why did you give him
all this opportunity?

834
01:36:44,142 --> 01:36:49,261
When you've groomed someone
the way we groomed Andy,

835
01:36:49,422 --> 01:36:54,982
nurturing him and lavishing
special treatment on him,

836
01:36:55,143 --> 01:36:57,743
it's quite an investment.

837
01:36:57,902 --> 01:37:01,342
We were waiting for the promise
to deliver.

838
01:37:01,542 --> 01:37:09,262
But ultimately, we could not ignore
the gap between reality and promise.

839
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:19,103
Thank you, Mr. Wheeler.

840
01:37:19,623 --> 01:37:24,382
No more questions, Your Honour.

841
01:37:26,783 --> 01:37:32,263
- Objection, Your Honour.
- All right, Mr. Miller.

842
01:37:32,423 --> 01:37:36,382
Mr. Wheeler, you are magnificent.

843
01:37:36,543 --> 01:37:41,382
You are my hero. Andrew's right.
You are the greatest.

844
01:37:41,583 --> 01:37:43,943
Are you gay?

845
01:37:44,623 --> 01:37:47,663
Objection.

846
01:37:48,344 --> 01:37:53,463
- How dare you!
- The witness will kindly answer.

847
01:37:55,224 --> 01:37:58,983
No, I am not a homosexual.

848
01:37:59,144 --> 01:38:04,463
Isn't it true that when you realized
your future senior partner was gay

849
01:38:04,624 --> 01:38:11,264
and had AIDS, it drove fear right
through your heterosexual heart?

850
01:38:11,423 --> 01:38:16,103
Remembering the hugs
and the handshakes. The sauna.

851
01:38:16,304 --> 01:38:20,744
The friendly pats on the backside
that guys exchange sometimes.

852
01:38:20,904 --> 01:38:26,464
It made you say, "My God!
What does this say about me?"

853
01:38:26,624 --> 01:38:29,903
Objection.

854
01:38:30,824 --> 01:38:34,903
The witness will please
respond to the question.

855
01:38:35,064 --> 01:38:41,584
Mr. Miller, your innuendos
and locker-room fantasies

856
01:38:41,744 --> 01:38:47,664
can't hide the fact your client
only worked when he wanted to.

857
01:38:47,825 --> 01:38:51,945
Telling us what he thought we needed
to know about who he really was.

858
01:38:52,105 --> 01:38:59,145
Andy insisted on bending the rules.
His work suffered as a result.

859
01:38:59,304 --> 01:39:03,304
Explain it like I'm a six-year-old,
because I just don't get it.

860
01:39:03,465 --> 01:39:07,505
Who makes these rules? You?

861
01:39:07,665 --> 01:39:12,745
Read your Bible, Mr. Miller.
Old and New Testament.

862
01:39:12,905 --> 01:39:15,185
Valuable rules.

863
01:39:15,345 --> 01:39:19,945
- Excuse me...
- Andrew?

864
01:39:20,225 --> 01:39:23,385
I can't...

865
01:39:28,425 --> 01:39:31,544
Somebody get a doctor.

866
01:39:33,426 --> 01:39:35,945
Turn him over.

867
01:39:36,106 --> 01:39:39,026
Call an ambulance.

868
01:39:40,185 --> 01:39:44,025
Let him breathe. Please, make room.

869
01:39:47,506 --> 01:39:51,585
It's not working!

870
01:39:51,746 --> 01:39:55,186
It's making him worse!

871
01:39:56,986 --> 01:40:01,185
Did you notice any changes
in Andrew's appearance

872
01:40:01,346 --> 01:40:05,025
in the year
leading up to his termination?

873
01:40:05,186 --> 01:40:10,946
- Yes, I did.
- Were they for the better or worse?

874
01:40:11,106 --> 01:40:15,065
Sometimes for the better,
but generally for the worse.

875
01:40:15,227 --> 01:40:21,226
Mr. Seidman, what did you think
caused these changes in appearance?

876
01:40:21,387 --> 01:40:25,147
I was afraid...

877
01:40:25,306 --> 01:40:28,426
I suspected Andy had AIDS.

878
01:40:28,707 --> 01:40:32,746
- Order!
- Thank you. Your witness.

879
01:40:32,907 --> 01:40:40,307
Did you share your suspicions
with any of the other partners -

880
01:40:40,467 --> 01:40:44,786
- before the decision
to fire Andrew Beckett was made?

881
01:40:44,947 --> 01:40:51,387
No, I didn't mention it to anyone.
Not even Andy.

882
01:40:51,547 --> 01:40:56,306
I didn't even give him a chance
to talk about it.

883
01:40:56,467 --> 01:41:01,227
And I think I'm going to regret that
for as long as I live.

884
01:41:01,427 --> 01:41:04,867
- Any more questions?
- That's all.

885
01:41:05,068 --> 01:41:09,987
They are saying
that he wasn't a good lawyer.

886
01:41:10,148 --> 01:41:16,387
Yet they gave him a lawsuit for
one of their most important clients.

887
01:41:16,548 --> 01:41:20,907
They say that doesn't prove
anything. It was just a test.

888
01:41:21,068 --> 01:41:23,988
They call it a "carrot".

889
01:41:24,148 --> 01:41:27,908
They wanted to see
if he would rise to the occasion.

890
01:41:28,109 --> 01:41:34,908
Say I had to send up a pilot up
in a plane that cost $350 million.

891
01:41:35,068 --> 01:41:38,307
Who am I gonna put in that plane?

892
01:41:38,468 --> 01:41:43,067
Some rookie, to see
if he can rise to the challenge?

893
01:41:43,228 --> 01:41:47,348
Or am I gonna give that assignment
to my best pilot?

894
01:41:47,508 --> 01:41:52,427
My most experienced... my top gun.

895
01:41:52,589 --> 01:41:55,549
I just don't get that.

896
01:41:55,708 --> 01:42:02,108
Will somebody explain it to me...
"like I'm a six-year-old".

897
01:42:03,389 --> 01:42:06,309
- Juror number 6?
- I agree.

898
01:42:06,469 --> 01:42:09,109
- Juror number 7?
- I agree.

899
01:42:14,189 --> 01:42:17,388
- Juror number 10?
- I disagree.

900
01:42:17,549 --> 01:42:19,988
- Juror number 11?
- I agree.

901
01:42:20,189 --> 01:42:23,548
- Juror number 12?
- I agree.

902
01:42:23,829 --> 01:42:28,748
- Have you awarded any damages?
- Yes, we have.

903
01:42:28,949 --> 01:42:34,229
For back pay and loss of benefits,
we award $143,000.

904
01:42:34,389 --> 01:42:38,829
For mental anguish and humiliation,
we award $100,000.

905
01:42:38,990 --> 01:42:44,589
And for punitive damages,
we award $4,782,000.

906
01:42:48,590 --> 01:42:51,190
You may record the verdict.

907
01:42:51,350 --> 01:42:56,109
Everyone remain seated
until the jury is removed.

908
01:42:59,871 --> 01:43:03,470
This trial is now concluded.

909
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:09,109
Congratulations.

910
01:43:09,270 --> 01:43:14,630
- We'll get a reversal on this one.
- We'll get started in the morning.

911
01:43:14,791 --> 01:43:18,150
Congratulations, Mr. Miller.
I'll see you at the appeal.

912
01:43:18,351 --> 01:43:21,630
Congratulations, well done.

913
01:43:24,951 --> 01:43:28,111
- Thanks a lot.
- I'll see you at the hospital.

914
01:43:35,550 --> 01:43:37,750
Mr. Miller, hi.

915
01:43:37,951 --> 01:43:42,231
He's just down the hall.

916
01:43:45,191 --> 01:43:48,190
I doubt he'll leave the hospital.

917
01:43:48,351 --> 01:43:52,791
If he does, he won't be
how he was before this crisis.

918
01:43:52,952 --> 01:43:55,791
He's lost the vision in one eye.

919
01:43:55,952 --> 01:44:00,192
And because of CMV
he will not regain his vision.

920
01:44:00,352 --> 01:44:04,872
- Next door on the right.
- CMV has ravaged his body.

921
01:44:11,911 --> 01:44:14,191
Congratulations.

922
01:44:14,391 --> 01:44:17,631
The man of the hour.

923
01:44:24,672 --> 01:44:27,312
Hi, Joe.

924
01:44:27,472 --> 01:44:30,352
We are so grateful to you.

925
01:44:30,512 --> 01:44:37,912
- Can I take that for you?
- It's some cheese... and stuff.

926
01:44:59,753 --> 01:45:03,832
How are you doing?

927
01:45:11,793 --> 01:45:18,673
What do you call a thousand lawyers
chained together on the sea bed?

928
01:45:18,833 --> 01:45:24,233
- I don't know.
- A good start.

929
01:45:32,073 --> 01:45:35,192
Excellent work, counsellor.

930
01:45:36,874 --> 01:45:39,593
I thank you.

931
01:45:39,754 --> 01:45:45,154
It was great working with you,
counsellor.

932
01:46:15,074 --> 01:46:18,594
I'd better go.

933
01:46:20,874 --> 01:46:23,674
Sure thing.

934
01:46:23,835 --> 01:46:26,514
I'll see you later?

935
01:46:29,195 --> 01:46:33,514
Thanks for stopping by.

936
01:46:35,075 --> 01:46:38,754
I'll see you again.

937
01:46:45,595 --> 01:46:49,634
I'll keep it on ice for you.

938
01:47:10,395 --> 01:47:16,394
- He's a fighter.
- I just want to get him home.

939
01:47:17,075 --> 01:47:20,835
Thank you, Joe.

940
01:47:45,437 --> 01:47:50,036
What do you call a thousand lawyers
chained together on the sea bed?

941
01:47:50,237 --> 01:47:53,196
- A good start.
- Very amusing.

942
01:47:53,196 --> 01:47:54,236
- A good start.
- Very amusing.

943
01:47:55,236 --> 01:48:00,516
I'll see you tomorrow, buddy.

944
01:48:09,397 --> 01:48:12,997
God bless you, Andy.

945
01:48:15,957 --> 01:48:20,477
Good night, son.
Try to get some rest.

946
01:48:20,637 --> 01:48:25,837
- I love you, Andy.
- I love you too, Dad.

947
01:48:27,677 --> 01:48:32,357
See you first thing tomorrow.

948
01:48:53,478 --> 01:48:59,717
- See you tomorrow.
- Come on, sweetheart.

949
01:49:09,438 --> 01:49:12,958
Good night, my angel.

950
01:49:13,118 --> 01:49:16,798
My sweet boy.

951
01:50:12,399 --> 01:50:15,759
Let me help you.

952
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:26,239
Miguel...

953
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:32,240
I'm ready.

954
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:54,359
Joe, it's Miguel.
