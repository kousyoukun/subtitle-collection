1
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,292
"Mexico.

2
00:00:15,492 --> 00:00:16,950
No precise date.

3
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:20,367
Everything, absolutely everything
is run by the cartels.

4
00:00:21,492 --> 00:00:24,658
The population has declined
due to the lack of women."

5
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,492
Let's go.

6
00:00:56,325 --> 00:00:57,200
Come on!

7
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:13,492
Kid!

8
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,700
Hey! Hey, kid!

9
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:35,167
Everything that is told
in this movie is real.

10
00:01:35,367 --> 00:01:38,242
Luck is also real,
and so are lucky men.

11
00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:45,325
They pass it down to their daughters,
who pass it down too, and so on.

12
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:50,200
Sometimes luck is made up,
but there's no point in that.

13
00:01:51,408 --> 00:01:53,542
I'm sure that my dad
is a lucky man.

14
00:01:53,742 --> 00:01:56,908
Otherwise, how could he survive
in a place as violent as this?

15
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:20,825
Hand me the shampoo, sweetie.

16
00:02:22,908 --> 00:02:24,200
Get down here.

17
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,908
It's been a long time since
we've heard any owls

18
00:03:00,242 --> 00:03:03,283
and lizards don't bask
in the sun anymore.

19
00:03:04,408 --> 00:03:08,367
Everyone left: neighbors, teachers.
There aren't many of us left.

20
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,700
You can count the hours
on the fingers of one hand.

21
00:03:14,283 --> 00:03:17,367
That's why my dad
wants to pass down his luck to me.

22
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:21,825
He has never said it,
but I can see it in his eyes.

23
00:03:30,825 --> 00:03:36,658
BUY ME A REVOLVER

24
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,533
What happened to your arm?

25
00:03:42,283 --> 00:03:44,375
They cut it off after I tried to escape.

26
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:48,325
- Why?
- Because they're evil bastards.

27
00:03:53,492 --> 00:03:55,742
I have a plan to get my arm back.

28
00:03:56,908 --> 00:03:59,867
- Will you help us?
- Help with what?

29
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,825
With a catapult we built
so we could attack them.

30
00:04:06,742 --> 00:04:08,492
What are you drawing?

31
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:12,867
I'm just practicing
because I used to be a leftie.

32
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,325
It's hard for me to draw and write
with my right hand.

33
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:24,408
I'm practicing baseball.

34
00:04:27,408 --> 00:04:29,908
- Making any progress?
- Yes.

35
00:04:30,908 --> 00:04:32,325
I'm not very good.

36
00:04:33,825 --> 00:04:37,742
I have trouble batting
and catching balls.

37
00:04:40,283 --> 00:04:43,283
What do you like better?
Batting or catching?

38
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:47,492
What I like the most is to steal bases.

39
00:05:07,825 --> 00:05:10,950
- Today is my birthday.
- Invite us!

40
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:15,492
Of course! You're all invited!

41
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,283
Huck!

42
00:05:48,325 --> 00:05:49,825
Get the geezers some beer!

43
00:05:55,825 --> 00:05:57,325
The air is dry today.

44
00:06:03,492 --> 00:06:05,325
Can I borrow your chapstick, boss?

45
00:06:11,575 --> 00:06:12,658
Thanks so much.

46
00:06:13,783 --> 00:06:15,325
Wait! Give me that bat!

47
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,325
Fuck.

48
00:06:55,492 --> 00:06:58,583
- But they're not the same!
- Remember we're umpires!

49
00:06:58,783 --> 00:07:02,375
- The playing field is different!
- We're from different leagues!

50
00:07:02,575 --> 00:07:06,908
- We'll never agree on this!
- It's all about discipline!

51
00:07:07,242 --> 00:07:10,325
We're never going to agree,
this is useless.

52
00:07:12,825 --> 00:07:14,867
The beer is warm!

53
00:07:15,325 --> 00:07:18,200
Why is the beer
always warm in this place!?

54
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,742
Why don't you buy some ice?

55
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,575
This chain is to keep me
from being snatched.

56
00:07:35,408 --> 00:07:36,867
They steal everything here.

57
00:07:37,325 --> 00:07:40,658
I once saw them stealing
flower pots from porches.

58
00:07:41,492 --> 00:07:44,658
The flowers on their trucks
started coming apart.

59
00:07:45,283 --> 00:07:47,200
The plants lost their leaves.

60
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:08,367
Here you go, from the boss.

61
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,908
I haven't seen you
around here for a while.

62
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,325
You owe us a lot of money.

63
00:08:16,658 --> 00:08:19,700
Why not ask to be paid in cash
instead of that shit?

64
00:08:21,492 --> 00:08:22,492
Well, maybe.

65
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:31,533
- Heard anything from them?
- I don't know what you mean.

66
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:33,367
Them.

67
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,700
The women.

68
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:41,575
Put those away.

69
00:08:42,617 --> 00:08:45,417
Put them away!
You'll get me in trouble with the boss.

70
00:08:45,617 --> 00:08:48,408
- Look at them.
- Put those fucking photos away!

71
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:53,367
Tear them up.
Forget about that shit already.

72
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,325
Fucking idiot.

73
00:09:03,492 --> 00:09:06,950
They're coming to play tonight.
Have the stadium ready, got it?

74
00:09:10,908 --> 00:09:12,492
I'll make sure it's ready.

75
00:09:13,492 --> 00:09:14,408
You better.

76
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:33,575
What are you doing here, sweetie?
Why aren't you working?

77
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:36,575
I couldn't find all the balls.

78
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:43,533
I have a present for you,
do you want to see it?

79
00:09:47,825 --> 00:09:48,950
Ta-da!

80
00:09:50,283 --> 00:09:53,200
It's for your lips.
Lift up your mask.

81
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,825
They're very dry.

82
00:10:05,492 --> 00:10:08,533
It's for you, take it.
Don't lose it, all right?

83
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:32,575
Write "Quique."

84
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:38,200
It hurts, why don't you take
the chain off if we're home?

85
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,658
- Those are the rules.
- But, why?

86
00:10:44,617 --> 00:10:45,825
Because I said so.

87
00:10:48,617 --> 00:10:49,825
It hurts.

88
00:10:54,283 --> 00:10:57,242
- "Rodolfo."
- It hurts a lot.

89
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,492
Write "Rodolfo."

90
00:11:02,825 --> 00:11:04,825
But the chain is hurting me.

91
00:11:09,242 --> 00:11:10,367
Let me take a look.

92
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:20,408
Let's see.

93
00:11:30,325 --> 00:11:31,492
Let me sit down.

94
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,658
Come here, sweetie.

95
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,417
It's going to hurt, isn't it?

96
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:45,325
Aren't you taking off the chain?

97
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:50,617
- Yes, to get you cleaned up.
- But only while you do it?

98
00:11:54,575 --> 00:11:55,908
Only while you do it?

99
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:59,825
You know those are the rules.

100
00:12:01,325 --> 00:12:04,325
- It's going to hurt.
- No, it's not, you'll see.

101
00:12:20,742 --> 00:12:22,325
- I don't wanna.
- Let me see.

102
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,542
- It'll hurt.
- It won't.

103
00:12:24,742 --> 00:12:26,375
- It will!
- It won't.

104
00:12:26,575 --> 00:12:27,533
Yes, it will!

105
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,867
- It hurts!
- There, there.

106
00:12:32,283 --> 00:12:33,542
It hurts!

107
00:12:33,742 --> 00:12:37,325
- I miss her so much.
- Who's that?

108
00:12:37,533 --> 00:12:39,325
My mom, of course.

109
00:12:43,242 --> 00:12:47,367
- We'll play catch later.
- No, I wanna talk about Mom.

110
00:12:47,908 --> 00:12:52,908
Where did you meet her?
I wanna see her picture again.

111
00:12:53,575 --> 00:12:54,950
Your batting needs work.

112
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:59,700
- Shall we play catch?
- No, I want to see her pictures.

113
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:05,867
Every time I show them to you,
you always get sad.

114
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,658
Not true, that was long ago.
I'm older now, I'm grown up.

115
00:13:12,742 --> 00:13:14,783
Last time, you cried.

116
00:13:16,242 --> 00:13:18,658
But that was a long time ago.

117
00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:28,242
- Will you help me clean the RV?
- I don't want to.

118
00:13:30,492 --> 00:13:32,908
I want to keep talking about my mom.

119
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:39,242
Where did you meet her?
I want to see her pictures.

120
00:13:39,658 --> 00:13:40,825
Cook those eggs.

121
00:14:16,325 --> 00:14:17,242
Huck!

122
00:14:17,742 --> 00:14:19,242
Cover your eyes!

123
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,242
I'm going to show you
your mom's pictures.

124
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,492
Oh, my lucky tooth!

125
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,575
Those bastards are here early.
Come here, baby.

126
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,950
Let's go to bed.
Pretend you're asleep.

127
00:15:32,492 --> 00:15:35,417
Get under the sheets,
pretend you're asleep.

128
00:15:35,617 --> 00:15:37,658
Cover yourself up!

129
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:46,242
Stay here.

130
00:15:46,825 --> 00:15:49,283
Don't move, OK?
Don't move.

131
00:15:57,408 --> 00:15:58,408
Hey, dude!

132
00:15:59,408 --> 00:16:00,658
Hey, shithead!

133
00:16:04,367 --> 00:16:05,450
He's here!

134
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,658
Damn sons of bitches.

135
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:11,083
Dude?

136
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Dude?

137
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:30,825
- Hey, dude! What's up?
- Hey, how are you doing?

138
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,200
- All good?
- Yeah.

139
00:16:34,408 --> 00:16:36,908
- Yeah?
- I thought you were coming later.

140
00:16:37,492 --> 00:16:41,325
- The gear's not ready yet...
- Take the bats outside.

141
00:16:43,783 --> 00:16:47,750
- How's everything?
- I'm just here, working.

142
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:51,367
- Like always,
- Your place is a fucking mess.

143
00:16:56,742 --> 00:16:59,450
- Where did you come from?
- San Pedro.

144
00:16:59,825 --> 00:17:02,200
Sons of bitches.

145
00:17:02,408 --> 00:17:06,283
We went to pick up some girls,
we got a tip they were there.

146
00:17:06,533 --> 00:17:08,450
- Guess what?
- What?

147
00:17:08,783 --> 00:17:10,583
We found them hiding
in a water tank.

148
00:17:10,783 --> 00:17:13,492
- Seven girls.
- No way, guys.

149
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:18,450
- That's how it is, dude.
- Fuck yes.

150
00:17:19,408 --> 00:17:22,533
- You guys are something.
- So, where's your boy?

151
00:17:22,783 --> 00:17:26,200
- At his grandparents'.
- That's nice.

152
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:29,658
- Are you getting water?
- Kind of, for the grass.

153
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,658
We'll send you a pipe or two
to keep the grass green.

154
00:17:33,908 --> 00:17:36,908
- Yeah, that'd be good.
- How about the candy?

155
00:17:37,867 --> 00:17:40,625
- Come on, you bastards.
- Huh? Where are they?

156
00:17:40,825 --> 00:17:42,700
- Don't be like that.
- Hey!

157
00:17:43,658 --> 00:17:46,125
You sell them to me
and want them back.

158
00:17:46,325 --> 00:17:48,242
You're our host!

159
00:17:48,658 --> 00:17:51,200
You sons of bitches.

160
00:17:51,658 --> 00:17:53,908
You should shave, motherfucker.

161
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:57,783
- So, Miguel...
- Look at this fucking mess.

162
00:17:58,408 --> 00:18:01,533
- Miguel? Take him there.
- All right, let's go.

163
00:18:01,783 --> 00:18:03,742
Come on, dude.
Let's hit the diamond.

164
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,492
- We have a game to play.
- All right, let's go.

165
00:18:07,742 --> 00:18:08,950
Come on.

166
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:04,708
My dad threw the bat
and broke one of their heads.

167
00:19:04,908 --> 00:19:06,583
They don't let him play.

168
00:19:06,783 --> 00:19:09,867
Dad said they owed him,
and that's why he did it.

169
00:19:10,408 --> 00:19:12,617
He hit three of them with a single bat.

170
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:43,200
- Look alive, guys!
- Hit it off the park!

171
00:19:46,242 --> 00:19:48,367
- Look at that!
- There we go.

172
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:55,208
Whenever I can, I hide the doses.

173
00:19:55,408 --> 00:19:58,533
But my dad is lucky
because he keeps finding them.

174
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:03,533
He says: "I'm so lucky, baby!"
And shows them off to me.

175
00:20:04,575 --> 00:20:06,950
I want to hide them
in the rattlesnake nest

176
00:20:07,283 --> 00:20:09,658
because he's afraid of vipers.

177
00:20:39,408 --> 00:20:40,950
What are you doing here?

178
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:42,825
I'm hiding something.

179
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:44,658
What's that?

180
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,867
Something bad.

181
00:20:48,575 --> 00:20:52,867
- Why?
- So my dad won't use it.

182
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:07,575
Hey, hey, hey!

183
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,825
Freeze, kid.

184
00:21:11,783 --> 00:21:13,200
Hands up!

185
00:21:13,658 --> 00:21:15,700
Get your hands up!
Walk towards the fence.

186
00:21:16,658 --> 00:21:18,367
Walk towards the fence!

187
00:21:19,742 --> 00:21:21,283
What's that in your hand?

188
00:21:21,908 --> 00:21:23,575
What's that in your hand!?

189
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:27,742
You little bastard!
Toss that over here.

190
00:21:28,325 --> 00:21:29,533
Hey.

191
00:21:31,825 --> 00:21:34,242
Who's there?
Who is there, huh?

192
00:21:34,492 --> 00:21:38,533
You, turn around!
I said turn around!

193
00:21:39,325 --> 00:21:43,950
You sneaky fuckers!
You goddamn dumb kids.

194
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,575
- Shut up, fuck...
- Shut your mouth!

195
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,742
The boss will be very happy
when he sees what I caught.

196
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,575
Get your hands up!

197
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,658
Get your fucking
hands in the air!

198
00:21:58,783 --> 00:22:00,242
Get on your knees.

199
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:06,450
God fucking damn it.

200
00:22:18,658 --> 00:22:21,700
Run away, sweetie!
Go, I said go!

201
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:24,242
I said go, damn it!

202
00:22:35,325 --> 00:22:38,700
Contact! Contact!
Get your guns!

203
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,533
Protect the boss!

204
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,533
Why are you here?
Why are you still here?

205
00:23:02,825 --> 00:23:04,367
Why are you still here?

206
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,825
We have to hide.

207
00:23:14,617 --> 00:23:17,242
Make yourself small, let's go!

208
00:23:18,658 --> 00:23:21,200
We have to hide.

209
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,492
Stay low.

210
00:23:38,492 --> 00:23:41,867
Ready? One, two, three.
There you go.

211
00:23:43,325 --> 00:23:45,625
- Come on, let's go!
- Go, go!

212
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:47,200
The diamond!

213
00:23:53,408 --> 00:23:56,950
Fan out, men!
Move forward!

214
00:23:57,908 --> 00:23:59,908
Cover more ground!

215
00:24:14,617 --> 00:24:18,325
Check the perimeter!
Cover it, motherfuckers!

216
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:24,492
- Eyes peeled, everyone.
- Move out.

217
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,658
Eyes open, everyone!

218
00:24:43,283 --> 00:24:46,200
Sometimes I find bullets on the ground.

219
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,700
At noon,
the bullets shine under the sunlight.

220
00:24:50,617 --> 00:24:53,533
It's as if a mirror had been broken.

221
00:24:55,908 --> 00:24:58,825
Huck, I have to go with them
to avoid suspicion.

222
00:24:59,908 --> 00:25:01,700
Hide in the bleachers, OK?

223
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,200
OK.

224
00:25:11,408 --> 00:25:12,408
That's it.

225
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,658
- Where's the boss?
- He's safe in here.

226
00:25:22,867 --> 00:25:25,867
Wait, dude, wait.
His cousin got killed.

227
00:25:30,325 --> 00:25:31,825
They killed your cousin.

228
00:25:36,908 --> 00:25:37,950
Where?

229
00:25:38,617 --> 00:25:40,292
- Behind the stadium.
- The area is clear...

230
00:25:40,492 --> 00:25:41,742
Shut up!

231
00:25:46,867 --> 00:25:49,617
- You two, go get him.
- Yes, sir. We're on it.

232
00:25:56,367 --> 00:25:58,950
Hey, Huck! Remember when
we play hide-and-seek?

233
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:01,200
Go on! Scram!

234
00:26:32,325 --> 00:26:33,783
What's up, dude?

235
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:36,458
Get that old bastard!

236
00:26:36,658 --> 00:26:38,825
- What the hell, man!?
- Hey, friends!

237
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,742
- Friends? Fuck outta here.
- What's up?

238
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,783
We just got shot at, motherfucker!

239
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,292
- I'm taking a shit!
- Get up!

240
00:26:48,492 --> 00:26:50,458
- I have diarrhea!
- Get the fuck up!

241
00:26:50,658 --> 00:26:53,825
- You think I give a fuck?!
- Get the fuck up!

242
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,583
Goddammit, fucking drugs!
You're fucked this time.

243
00:26:59,783 --> 00:27:03,375
- Get out!
- Out, you piece of shit.

244
00:27:03,575 --> 00:27:06,658
- On your feet!
- Get up! Let's go!

245
00:27:21,242 --> 00:27:23,492
I was just taking a shit,
for fuck's sake.

246
00:27:29,325 --> 00:27:31,658
- Where were you?
- I was taking a shit.

247
00:27:35,617 --> 00:27:37,825
- Was he taking a shit?
- Affirmative, sir.

248
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:43,450
Did you know my cousin got killed
while you were taking a shit?

249
00:27:43,825 --> 00:27:45,325
No. Oswaldo?

250
00:28:07,742 --> 00:28:09,200
And your daughter?

251
00:28:09,908 --> 00:28:11,242
Where is she?

252
00:28:14,825 --> 00:28:17,750
You already took my wife,
and my oldest girl.

253
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,908
- We agreed she was a boy.
- Speak up, man.

254
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:23,200
We agreed she was a boy,
you already took the others.

255
00:28:23,825 --> 00:28:25,408
So, where's the kid?

256
00:28:25,617 --> 00:28:27,242
At his grandparents'.

257
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,575
He'll be back tomorrow.

258
00:28:34,283 --> 00:28:35,492
How's the RV?

259
00:28:37,742 --> 00:28:39,742
- My house?
- Yes, the RV.

260
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,242
You like it?

261
00:28:45,492 --> 00:28:47,450
- Yes.
- Can I see it?

262
00:28:51,242 --> 00:28:52,408
Sure.

263
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,200
Your RV is filthy.
Get up.

264
00:30:30,492 --> 00:30:31,533
What's this?

265
00:30:32,908 --> 00:30:34,292
- What?
- Who did you steal it from?

266
00:30:34,492 --> 00:30:36,542
- I have no fucking idea.
- Oh, you don't?

267
00:30:36,742 --> 00:30:38,458
- No.
- You don't!?

268
00:30:38,658 --> 00:30:39,783
I don't!

269
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,408
- Shoot this fucker!
- No, no!

270
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,450
Don't waste your bull...

271
00:30:58,367 --> 00:31:00,950
And you fuckers are supposed
to be guarding my back!?

272
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,658
I'm still alive, don't kill me.

273
00:31:09,783 --> 00:31:11,783
Don't, don't kill me.

274
00:31:12,658 --> 00:31:14,908
- Come here.
- Don't kill me.

275
00:31:15,658 --> 00:31:19,908
There's a party tomorrow.
I need you to bring your musicians.

276
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,825
And bring your daughter.

277
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,783
Yes, boss.

278
00:31:28,492 --> 00:31:30,825
I want some of your luck
for my birthday.

279
00:31:32,617 --> 00:31:33,658
We're leaving.

280
00:32:08,658 --> 00:32:11,783
Dad, are you all right?
Did they hurt you?

281
00:32:16,492 --> 00:32:17,825
Did they hurt you?

282
00:32:20,283 --> 00:32:21,617
I'm all right.

283
00:32:22,492 --> 00:32:24,367
Come on, let's go to bed.

284
00:32:24,617 --> 00:32:27,367
- But, did they hurt you?
- No, they didn't.

285
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,783
Shall we go to bed?
Are you ready?

286
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,325
Let's go.

287
00:35:04,408 --> 00:35:06,658
Huck, come back!

288
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,908
- You woke me up.
- Watch me hit the trash can.

289
00:35:15,367 --> 00:35:16,867
Watch me do it.

290
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:18,783
One, two!

291
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:28,200
How about another one?
Just one more.

292
00:35:29,325 --> 00:35:32,700
Watch this. One, two...!

293
00:35:40,492 --> 00:35:44,325
We have to celebrate!
We are alive!

294
00:35:45,283 --> 00:35:47,200
"The Boss" is a woman.

295
00:35:48,242 --> 00:35:49,492
No way.

296
00:35:49,908 --> 00:35:51,325
What makes you say that?

297
00:35:52,658 --> 00:35:54,367
Did you see his tits or something?

298
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,283
No, don't say that.
I saw her long hair, it's lovely.

299
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:01,658
So, what?

300
00:36:04,283 --> 00:36:07,325
Why don't you help me
clean up all those beer cans?

301
00:36:07,867 --> 00:36:09,325
They made a mess.

302
00:36:10,367 --> 00:36:12,742
Why me?
Why not you?

303
00:36:14,492 --> 00:36:16,950
Because kids are supposed
to help their parents.

304
00:36:18,325 --> 00:36:20,867
I'm tired.
I'm sleepy.

305
00:36:28,492 --> 00:36:32,825
Why don't you pay me?
You work here, so it's your job.

306
00:36:33,742 --> 00:36:35,325
You exploit me.

307
00:36:38,825 --> 00:36:40,908
I don't exploit you.
They exploit me.

308
00:36:41,492 --> 00:36:43,333
I should be unionized...

309
00:36:43,533 --> 00:36:46,492
because the boss exploits me,
that fucking bastard.

310
00:36:59,492 --> 00:37:01,367
No way!
Where did you get that?

311
00:37:03,367 --> 00:37:04,742
Where did you find it!?

312
00:37:08,783 --> 00:37:11,283
We have to celebrate!
I have nine lives, like a cat.

313
00:37:17,325 --> 00:37:19,533
Cheers, sweetie.
This calls for a celebration.

314
00:37:20,825 --> 00:37:23,325
We have to celebrate that
we made it out alive today.

315
00:37:25,367 --> 00:37:26,700
Goddammit.

316
00:37:32,575 --> 00:37:35,200
You don't mind, do you?
Just for today.

317
00:37:39,325 --> 00:37:41,242
I dropped some, like an idiot.

318
00:37:52,325 --> 00:37:53,742
What a nice gift.

319
00:38:01,325 --> 00:38:02,533
Look at this.

320
00:38:07,533 --> 00:38:08,825
Here it comes.

321
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:21,325
Angel!

322
00:39:21,742 --> 00:39:24,061
You need to keep your gun
in your hand at all times!

323
00:39:24,658 --> 00:39:26,417
Hey, Rafa! Rafa!

324
00:39:26,617 --> 00:39:29,408
Put your shoe on!
Keep them on.

325
00:39:30,742 --> 00:39:33,492
Hold your gun tightly.
Here you go.

326
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,242
Look at this.

327
00:39:42,575 --> 00:39:44,200
Get in the cage.

328
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:51,450
Take this.

329
00:39:56,825 --> 00:40:00,325
The only way you can get out
is by digging a tunnel.

330
00:40:01,783 --> 00:40:04,200
You could start by loosening the soil.

331
00:40:06,575 --> 00:40:08,783
Then, you have to dig.

332
00:40:11,658 --> 00:40:14,367
Some time ago,
I had to dig my own tunnel.

333
00:40:14,617 --> 00:40:18,200
- Why?
- They had me locked up.

334
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:20,658
It was a long tunnel.

335
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,658
But it saved my life.

336
00:40:23,408 --> 00:40:26,450
- Really?
- Yes, I had no other choice.

337
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:32,575
I just kept digging
until I was able to escape.

338
00:40:33,533 --> 00:40:36,492
- I escaped.
- I'm glad you did.

339
00:40:48,575 --> 00:40:51,408
- What's that?
- The statue of the mothers.

340
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:53,200
The statue of the mothers.

341
00:40:55,367 --> 00:40:58,825
- Why is her hair so messy?
- It's been very windy lately.

342
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,825
- Have you seen our catapult?
- What's that?

343
00:41:41,242 --> 00:41:42,367
Come with me.

344
00:41:50,658 --> 00:41:52,492
Give her a hand.

345
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,658
Don't move!
We're doing target practice!

346
00:41:57,867 --> 00:41:58,950
Be brave!

347
00:43:14,742 --> 00:43:16,450
I want the purple one.

348
00:43:22,325 --> 00:43:24,742
He must've eaten something
that had gone bad.

349
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,492
That's crazy,

350
00:43:33,658 --> 00:43:37,242
Who's fighting me?
Go ahead!

351
00:43:45,867 --> 00:43:47,408
You, too, kids!

352
00:43:52,575 --> 00:43:54,867
- Here's your lightsaber, Huck!
- Thank you!

353
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:58,825
I'll take cover.

354
00:44:00,825 --> 00:44:02,242
There you go.

355
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,200
Throw it at him!

356
00:44:07,742 --> 00:44:09,200
Get him!

357
00:44:14,492 --> 00:44:16,408
Who wants to eat some hot cakes?

358
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:30,200
They're good, huh?

359
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:32,700
I'm the hot cake monster!

360
00:44:33,658 --> 00:44:37,325
- The hot cake monster!
- There's five of us.

361
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:42,742
Do you like them?
They're good, huh?

362
00:44:43,783 --> 00:44:45,325
Get closer.

363
00:44:45,867 --> 00:44:47,583
They're good, sir.

364
00:44:47,783 --> 00:44:49,867
What about you?
You don't want any?

365
00:44:50,367 --> 00:44:51,867
- Try one.
- Yes, try one.

366
00:44:52,283 --> 00:44:54,617
Come on, try one.

367
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,375
I want to go get my arm.

368
00:45:04,575 --> 00:45:07,200
- Why?
- I need it.

369
00:45:08,408 --> 00:45:11,575
- What for?
- I need it.

370
00:45:12,283 --> 00:45:13,408
What for?

371
00:45:15,658 --> 00:45:16,950
None of your business.

372
00:45:18,658 --> 00:45:20,022
Why is it none of my business?

373
00:45:22,283 --> 00:45:23,533
You don't get it.

374
00:45:23,783 --> 00:45:27,367
Sometimes
I feel my hand open or closed.

375
00:45:30,408 --> 00:45:31,450
Dad?

376
00:45:32,783 --> 00:45:34,492
Is it a good idea
for me to come?

377
00:45:34,867 --> 00:45:36,200
Yes, I told you.

378
00:45:36,825 --> 00:45:39,283
We'll always be together,
you'll be by my side.

379
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,200
Don't worry.

380
00:45:42,867 --> 00:45:44,533
I'm scared.

381
00:45:46,325 --> 00:45:50,867
My friends told me that
they put kids in a cage.

382
00:45:52,575 --> 00:45:55,492
Don't be scared, honey.
It's just a party.

383
00:45:56,325 --> 00:45:58,200
Nothing will happen,
I'll look after you.

384
00:45:58,492 --> 00:46:00,325
Besides, we're having
good luck lately.

385
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,492
- How many lives do cats have?
- Nine.

386
00:46:07,575 --> 00:46:11,242
- Who killed a guy with his shorts?
- You did.

387
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:14,367
- Who hid you in the tree?
- You did.

388
00:46:15,617 --> 00:46:18,533
See? Don't worry.
Plus, you'll have your helmet.

389
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:23,825
You're protected.

390
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:26,783
I'll take care of you.

391
00:47:38,658 --> 00:47:41,458
- What's up?
- I have the musicians for the boss.

392
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:43,340
- Where are you going?
- To the party.

393
00:47:43,742 --> 00:47:46,408
All right, fine.

394
00:47:47,533 --> 00:47:49,658
Clear the way for him!
Move that car!

395
00:48:09,242 --> 00:48:10,492
Stop right there!

396
00:48:12,658 --> 00:48:14,867
- Good evening.
- Evening.

397
00:48:16,492 --> 00:48:18,625
- Who are these fuckers?
- Musicians.

398
00:48:18,825 --> 00:48:21,458
- We're playing at the party.
- OK.

399
00:48:21,658 --> 00:48:25,167
They're the musicians,
and a kid, son of one of them.

400
00:48:25,367 --> 00:48:28,658
A kid?
So why is that kid wearing a mask?

401
00:48:29,325 --> 00:48:31,950
He's my son,
he likes costumes and baseball.

402
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:35,700
All right, let's get
that fucking kid off the truck.

403
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,867
- Chiquilín!
- Hold this.

404
00:48:38,325 --> 00:48:39,950
- Give him here.
- Let's go, Huck.

405
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,500
- Not you! Just the boy!
- I'll go with him.

406
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,950
Check the kid!

407
00:48:45,658 --> 00:48:46,825
Héctor!

408
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:50,700
Get these musicians out
and make them stand there.

409
00:48:53,492 --> 00:48:55,658
We're going to frisk every single one.

410
00:49:01,908 --> 00:49:04,492
Get them on their knees.
You too, fucker.

411
00:49:08,908 --> 00:49:12,325
- This fucking faggot.
- I'll have to get rough.

412
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:15,658
- Frisk all of them!
- We're clean, man.

413
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,325
- Be thorough!
- Enough, man.

414
00:49:20,908 --> 00:49:23,658
- Found anything?
- No.

415
00:49:24,658 --> 00:49:27,492
- Did you check all of them?
- Hey, boss!

416
00:49:27,783 --> 00:49:30,408
- What's the matter?
- She's a girl.

417
00:49:30,742 --> 00:49:33,742
- What the fuck?
- No, no! She's my daughter.

418
00:49:34,242 --> 00:49:35,708
- What!?
- She's my daughter.

419
00:49:35,908 --> 00:49:39,200
- What is this fucker saying?
- She's his daughter!

420
00:49:39,658 --> 00:49:43,667
- She's my daughter!
- You're fucked! Fucked!

421
00:49:43,867 --> 00:49:46,408
- Please! She's my daughter!
- Fuck you.

422
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:51,617
All right, Villegas.
Enough of your posturing.

423
00:49:51,908 --> 00:49:53,700
Leave the musicians alone.

424
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:58,825
They asked me to bring them,
so don't mess up my orders.

425
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,783
If you want the musicians,
you can take them.

426
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,825
- OK, then.
- The girl stays here.

427
00:50:05,242 --> 00:50:07,470
- We're not leaving without her.
- She stays here!

428
00:50:07,867 --> 00:50:10,542
- Get them back in the car!
- Wait, wait.

429
00:50:10,742 --> 00:50:12,742
- Wait, stop!
- My daughter!

430
00:50:13,242 --> 00:50:15,658
- Do it.
- Easy, brother!

431
00:50:17,533 --> 00:50:19,617
Listen to me, baldy.

432
00:50:20,825 --> 00:50:24,408
If they won't play
because of the girl...

433
00:50:24,617 --> 00:50:27,783
you'll answer to me,
my orders are to bring them.

434
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,791
I don't give a fuck.
She stays here.

435
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,783
I said no, baldy!

436
00:50:32,367 --> 00:50:34,542
There won't be a party
without the musicians.

437
00:50:34,742 --> 00:50:36,617
- I just...
- Shut up, fucker!

438
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:39,950
Let's find a solution.
Do you read me?

439
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,950
Do me a favor, dude.
Call the boss for me.

440
00:50:45,367 --> 00:50:48,783
Tell him I ran into baldy
at the first checkpoint.

441
00:50:49,408 --> 00:50:50,492
Villegas.

442
00:50:51,658 --> 00:50:56,658
Tell him I got the musicians
but he won't let us in.

443
00:50:57,492 --> 00:51:01,742
You know there's no party
without good music.

444
00:51:02,658 --> 00:51:03,700
You got that?

445
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,408
- You asked for it.
- All right, man.

446
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,658
All right, drop the radio.

447
00:51:13,908 --> 00:51:16,492
Do you want them
to put me in a cage? Is that it?

448
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,167
No, I don't want that.
We're staying together.

449
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:22,783
- Why did you bring me here?
- I'm protecting you.

450
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:27,242
- Why are you making me go?
- I'm not, I just want to protect you.

451
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:32,492
- Do you want them to snatch me?
- There are still more checkpoints!

452
00:51:33,325 --> 00:51:37,492
How could you bring a girl
to a place like this, you idiot?

453
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:41,283
I almost got killed
because of you.

454
00:51:41,908 --> 00:51:44,292
You did notice, right?
Good thing that baldy...

455
00:51:44,492 --> 00:51:48,417
bought the radio thing,
but who takes care of me?

456
00:51:48,617 --> 00:51:50,908
Who the hell will help me
with the boss?

457
00:51:52,283 --> 00:51:55,367
- I'm sorry, boss.
- Fuck you, man.

458
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:11,200
Oh, how nice it is to fly...

459
00:52:11,867 --> 00:52:15,783
At two in the morning

460
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:20,783
At two in the morning...

461
00:52:21,575 --> 00:52:25,617
Oh, how nice it is to fly!

462
00:52:26,325 --> 00:52:30,200
To fly and let oneself fall

463
00:52:30,908 --> 00:52:34,242
Into the arms of a lady!

464
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:39,450
Into the arms of a lady...

465
00:52:40,533 --> 00:52:43,700
I could even cry

466
00:52:45,283 --> 00:52:49,825
The witch grabs me
And takes me home

467
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,700
She turns me into stone
And then into a pumpkin

468
00:52:56,242 --> 00:53:00,658
The witch grabs me
And takes me to the barracks

469
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:05,867
She gives me some candy
And also some food

470
00:53:06,367 --> 00:53:10,658
Will you please tell me...

471
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,408
Honey, I know it's late
but send me a pic...

472
00:53:15,617 --> 00:53:17,625
I'm bored. By the way!

473
00:53:17,825 --> 00:53:21,242
The band you like
is playing at the party.

474
00:53:21,492 --> 00:53:22,658
That's right.

475
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:27,500
I'll send you a YouTube link

476
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,325
so you can listen to it.

477
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:36,658
Give me a minute.
I'll call you back soon.

478
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,950
Just send me those pics.

479
00:53:43,242 --> 00:53:44,658
GOD IS WITH ME

480
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,575
- Get them all out!
- Out, out! Quickly!

481
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:06,617
- Come on, hurry!
- Huck!

482
00:54:06,825 --> 00:54:09,325
- What's up, dude?
- Get out, hands up.

483
00:54:11,367 --> 00:54:13,575
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

484
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,450
- Bring them all here!
- All of them!

485
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:25,492
Come on, hurry up!
Get over here.

486
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,125
- Get on your knees.
- On your knees.

487
00:54:29,325 --> 00:54:33,200
What's up? It's all good.
Don't scare them, chill out.

488
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:35,783
- Are you the Colombian?
- I sure am.

489
00:54:36,283 --> 00:54:39,325
- I have heard about you.
- Oh, thank you.

490
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,575
- It's all good, guys.
- Shut up, fucker.

491
00:54:42,825 --> 00:54:47,200
- Take it easy, man.
- Walk, asshole.

492
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,492
This shit doesn't fly here,
you faggot.

493
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:57,325
- Fucking asshole.
- Calm down, don't move.

494
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,492
All right, then.
Where are you going?

495
00:55:02,492 --> 00:55:05,325
- We're the musicians, boss.
- Oh, is that right?

496
00:55:06,283 --> 00:55:09,292
- What's with the kid?
- He's helping with the diamond.

497
00:55:09,492 --> 00:55:11,200
There's going to be a baseball game.

498
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:13,658
- Who are the musicians?
- They're the band.

499
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:16,575
- Here, here!
- It's us.

500
00:55:16,825 --> 00:55:19,242
- Musicians, raise your hands!
- Here.

501
00:55:19,617 --> 00:55:22,667
All right, that's good.
Looks like you need a driver.

502
00:55:22,867 --> 00:55:25,617
- I'm coming with you, all right?
- Yes, boss.

503
00:55:25,825 --> 00:55:27,625
- Good.
- You and I know each other.

504
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:30,125
I'm the guy from the stadium
where you usually play.

505
00:55:30,325 --> 00:55:32,200
We've never met, motherfucker.

506
00:55:33,492 --> 00:55:37,908
- Do you rent us the stadium?
- No, I'm the groundskeeper.

507
00:55:38,325 --> 00:55:40,908
- You can trust me.
- Enough! Back in the car!

508
00:55:41,533 --> 00:55:44,908
- Do it, you fuckers!
- Quickly, quickly!

509
00:55:45,617 --> 00:55:49,325
- Back in the car!
- Come on, quickly!

510
00:55:49,867 --> 00:55:51,825
Hurry, kiddo.

511
00:55:54,825 --> 00:55:56,367
Hey, babe.

512
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,242
Guess where I'm headed.
I got into the party.

513
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:04,458
When I get there, I'll send you
a picture of the band you like.

514
00:56:04,658 --> 00:56:07,783
But only if you send me
those pics of you.

515
00:56:08,408 --> 00:56:11,625
It's a fair trade, isn't it?
I'll send photos soon.

516
00:56:11,825 --> 00:56:13,908
All right, kisses.

517
00:56:16,367 --> 00:56:18,825
So, what's the matter?
Why are all you so quiet?

518
00:56:20,325 --> 00:56:22,617
He was only a fucking Colombian, guys.

519
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,658
Huck, I'm going to play.
Everything will be all right.

520
00:57:05,367 --> 00:57:08,375
I need you to stay here.
Don't get out, got it?

521
00:57:08,575 --> 00:57:09,825
Give me that.

522
00:57:10,325 --> 00:57:11,658
The trumpet!

523
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,492
Here we go!

524
00:58:55,658 --> 00:58:57,908
I'm sleepy,
but the wind moves the plants

525
00:58:58,325 --> 00:59:00,742
and it almost seems like
they're trying to walk.

526
00:59:02,825 --> 00:59:05,625
Sometimes it's so windy
that the clouds leave

527
00:59:05,825 --> 00:59:08,325
and don't come back for a while.

528
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:19,450
It's your lucky day, girl.

529
00:59:21,242 --> 00:59:22,658
Your dad's at the party.

530
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,367
He's wearing a blue shirt.

531
00:59:30,783 --> 00:59:32,325
I'm hungry.

532
00:59:36,617 --> 00:59:37,825
This is all I have.

533
00:59:48,825 --> 00:59:51,325
Don't you tell anyone
I unlocked this door.

534
01:01:22,658 --> 01:01:23,658
Huck!

535
01:01:24,867 --> 01:01:28,783
- What are you doing here?
- We came to get Angel's arm.

536
01:01:29,325 --> 01:01:30,867
I'm looking for it, too.

537
01:01:31,325 --> 01:01:33,575
Help us find it.
It's in a cooler.

538
01:01:33,867 --> 01:01:35,658
We already searched a few.

539
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:51,825
Let's get started!
Let's party!

540
01:02:52,825 --> 01:02:54,867
Let's give a hand to the birthday boy!

541
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:11,367
- What's going on, Dad?
- Huck!

542
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:13,000
- Where are you going?
- Are you OK?

543
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,625
- Are you leaving me?
- I was looking for you, you OK?

544
01:05:16,825 --> 01:05:19,667
- Don't leave me!
- You can't come with me.

545
01:05:19,867 --> 01:05:21,167
- Don't go!
- Stay here!

546
01:05:21,367 --> 01:05:22,867
- No!
- You have to stay here!

547
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,408
We're supposed to be together.
Please don't leave me!

548
01:05:27,325 --> 01:05:29,500
Get the money and watches
from everyone back there.

549
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:31,500
I don't want to see dead people.

550
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,292
- Look for your sister!
- I'm scared!

551
01:05:33,492 --> 01:05:36,408
- Look for your sister, she's sick!
- I don't have one!

552
01:05:36,617 --> 01:05:39,492
You do have a sister!
Please, go back.

553
01:05:39,742 --> 01:05:42,700
- Don't leave me!
- Head for the sea! I'll find you!

554
01:05:43,283 --> 01:05:46,658
I'll meet you girls there!
Huck, stay here!

555
01:05:47,283 --> 01:05:48,867
- No!
- Stay here!

556
01:05:49,658 --> 01:05:50,950
Don't leave me!

557
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:19,200
Protect me, lucky tooth.

558
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:53,617
I found the arm!

559
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:29,242
Hey!

560
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:32,492
Help me! I'm hurt!

561
01:08:35,617 --> 01:08:38,450
Hey! Hey! Help me!

562
01:08:49,867 --> 01:08:52,667
Go get a cart
and some camouflage canvas.

563
01:08:52,867 --> 01:08:54,325
I can't move.

564
01:09:24,658 --> 01:09:26,825
We have to go!
We're under attack.

565
01:09:27,658 --> 01:09:29,283
- Go where?
- I don't know, hurry.

566
01:09:29,492 --> 01:09:31,825
- Where are we going?
- Let's go.

567
01:09:32,492 --> 01:09:34,742
- Where are we going?
- Let's go!

568
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:42,575
Hurry up!
We're being followed!

569
01:09:43,658 --> 01:09:45,450
- Hurry up!
- I don't see anyone.

570
01:09:45,742 --> 01:09:48,242
Just do as I say.
Hurry up!

571
01:10:22,825 --> 01:10:26,492
We'll stay here for a while.
You can sleep if you want.

572
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:33,700
Something stinks.
What's that smell?

573
01:10:35,658 --> 01:10:40,200
I have Angel's arm.
He's my friend.

574
01:10:42,742 --> 01:10:44,617
Are you friends with Angel?

575
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:52,867
- That kid is a thief.
- But he's my friend.

576
01:10:54,658 --> 01:10:56,200
But he's a thief.

577
01:10:57,242 --> 01:10:59,200
Maybe to you.

578
01:11:05,950 --> 01:11:08,283
You're a thief, too.

579
01:13:09,408 --> 01:13:11,908
I like you hair.
It's beautiful.

580
01:13:13,325 --> 01:13:16,450
You think?
But it's all dirty, look.

581
01:13:16,867 --> 01:13:18,325
It's so tangled.

582
01:13:20,408 --> 01:13:23,325
- Why is it so long?
- Hair grows.

583
01:13:23,658 --> 01:13:27,625
- Why do you cut yours?
- Dad wanted it short.

584
01:13:27,825 --> 01:13:29,825
He is afraid I might get snatched.

585
01:13:31,575 --> 01:13:34,200
Look, it's tangled and dirty.

586
01:13:34,867 --> 01:13:37,325
Now that you're with me,
you can grow it out.

587
01:13:40,825 --> 01:13:42,700
Are you a man or a woman?

588
01:13:44,617 --> 01:13:45,825
I'm both.

589
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:48,325
How come?

590
01:13:48,783 --> 01:13:51,867
Yes, I'm both.
I like being a man and also a woman.

591
01:13:52,325 --> 01:13:55,825
So you have a girl's name
and a boy's name?

592
01:13:57,367 --> 01:13:58,825
I have only one name.

593
01:13:59,658 --> 01:14:01,908
But I like being a man
and also a woman.

594
01:14:05,742 --> 01:14:07,658
- Do you know how to shoot?
- No.

595
01:14:08,242 --> 01:14:09,658
Hand it over.

596
01:14:15,783 --> 01:14:18,658
This is the safety,
you have to take it off.

597
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:22,617
Once it's off, the gun is ready.

598
01:14:23,492 --> 01:14:25,200
Pull this back, and shoot.

599
01:14:26,617 --> 01:14:28,658
You have to shoot anyone you see.

600
01:14:32,367 --> 01:14:33,783
I'll put it away.

601
01:14:34,783 --> 01:14:36,533
I'll lay down for a while.

602
01:14:37,492 --> 01:14:39,200
I'm in a lot of pain,

603
01:14:40,825 --> 01:14:43,658
You take first watch
and then I'll relieve you.

604
01:15:20,575 --> 01:15:21,783
Huck!

605
01:15:24,908 --> 01:15:25,950
Huck!

606
01:15:36,325 --> 01:15:37,283
Rafa!

607
01:15:37,492 --> 01:15:39,408
Angel! Tom!

608
01:15:45,867 --> 01:15:47,658
- Huck's coming!

609
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:52,283
Huck, Huck!

610
01:15:52,867 --> 01:15:53,825
Huck!

611
01:16:00,867 --> 01:16:01,825
Huck!

612
01:16:04,658 --> 01:16:06,742
What are you doing there?

613
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:09,658
That guy is evil!

614
01:16:10,950 --> 01:16:12,658
He's an evil man!

615
01:16:13,742 --> 01:16:16,458
He's the one who cut off Angel's arm

616
01:16:16,658 --> 01:16:18,742
and locked us in those cages.

617
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:22,242
Let's go, come on!
Hurry up!

618
01:16:23,742 --> 01:16:25,242
Get the guns!

619
01:16:31,658 --> 01:16:33,783
Here he is, Rafa!
Let's get the guns!

620
01:16:56,867 --> 01:16:59,292
- Did she kill him?
- She did!

621
01:16:59,492 --> 01:17:00,575
She killed him!

622
01:17:02,825 --> 01:17:04,492
Come on, Huck!
Jump!

623
01:17:04,908 --> 01:17:06,825
- Go on!
- Jump, Huck!

624
01:17:07,242 --> 01:17:08,783
You can do it!
Jump!

625
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:44,825
Thanks.

626
01:18:40,617 --> 01:18:43,750
The boys are looking for
the bullet I fired.

627
01:18:43,950 --> 01:18:45,908
They say it's a treasure.

628
01:18:46,325 --> 01:18:49,617
Now they call me "boss"
and we're getting the catapult

629
01:18:49,825 --> 01:18:51,742
so we can rescue my dad.
