00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,030
Murders were thick on the ground.

2
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,320
Is it because the weather\Nis good these days?

3
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,600
I'm happy.

4
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,160
We've got to catch one of them.

5
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,430
But the director and the team \Npretended they didn't hear.

6
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,170
What do we do?

7
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,360
We should do it.

8
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,289
- We?\N- Yes.

9
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:27,110
You and me.

10
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,660
Lee Ji-Goo came here alone

11
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,860
last year and asked for a\Nrefund of the prepaid coupon?

12
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:33,740
Yeah, right?

13
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,229
It wasn't allowed.

14
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,460
I said I'd ask my boss

15
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:38,930
and then I texted you, Officer.

16
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,190
That's a great job.

17
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,400
I showed you pictures a long time ago.

18
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:46,289
It just popped into my mind.

19
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,330
Did he say he will come again?

20
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,820
{\i1}[OPPA INTERNET CAFE]{\i0}

21
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,140
Are you happy to go home \Nwithout me on the weekend?

22
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:00,050
Are you staying with me now?

23

Keep talking.

{\i1}That's why you should sleep\Na little more tonight.{\i0}

{\i1}What if it's dangerous?{\i0}

28
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,260
You don't get enough sleep

29
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,570
because you spend all day\Ndoing latent work.

30
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:22,050
It's not that I can't sleep. \NIt's just that I don't sleep.

31
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,710
I couldn't sleep, so I lurked there.

32

Are there many people staying \Nin the dormitory on weekends?

34
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,040
He's busy because of the\NOlympic math competition.

35
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,300
Why does a junior high school \Nstudent competing like that?

36
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,670
He's a science major, so he take after me.

37
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,640
I totally understand him.

38
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,040
It'd be nice to order any sushi.

39
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,670
I don't want to eat that inauthentic sushi.

40
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,140
I want to cook you something hot \Nwhen I'm around.

41
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,260
Can't you transfer to Lipo?

42
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,120
I want to have hot soup every day.

43
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,690
Our neighbor, Samantha.

44
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,180
Yeah.

45
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,020
She's pretending to be worried about me, \Nbut secretly embarrassing me.

46
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,290
She said,

47
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:21,120
Six of the couples were seriously considering divorce over the weekend and asked me if I'm okay.

48
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,370
So what did you said?

49
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,720
I say 55% of sexless couples \Nget divorced and asked her if she's okay.

{\i1}[DECISION TO LEAVE]{\i0}

52
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,550
After grabbing the rope and \Nclimbed to the top of the mountain,

53
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,570
I think it was when he fell off the \Ntop of the mountain and hit it.

54
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:03,000
Up there, over there, here, and here.

55
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,680
Wearing an expensive headphones.

56
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,690
Ten o'clock, Monday.

57
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,360
We'd better go up.

58
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,209
Is the helicopter coming?

59
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,660
I heard it's okay to walk. \NWhy do we have to go this way?

60
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:32,470
Because it's the way how the\N dead have died, and we are the police.

61
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,330
Then, are we going to fall \Nwhen coming down?

62
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,670
Will we collide three times?

63
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,800
Why does anyone need to\Nclimb rock like this?

64
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,170
Shouldn't it be prohibited by law?

65
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,580
Oh, it really hurts.

66
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,520
Ah, I got it.

67
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,910
60-year-old Kim Do-Soo's belongings\Nare engraved with initials.

68
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,970
He drunk soju.

69
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,159
And whiskey.

70
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,720
Please don't go near the cliff!

71
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,570
He retired after working as a civil servant\Nat the Immigration and Foreign Affairs Agency,

72
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,440
and until his death, he was\Nstill there with the Minger interviewer.

73
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,790
It opened.

74
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,240
His daughter is charming.

75
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,560
Will you be able to open it that easily?

76
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,010
You dad's over here.

77
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,560
I'm Song Seo-Rae, Ki Do-Soo's wife.

78
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,240
I can't speak Korean enough because I'm Chinese.

79
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,580
You must be quite shocked.

80
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,640
I was worried

81
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,750
If he climb up the mountain \Nand don't come back.

82
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,190
I'm afraid he'll die. At last.

83
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,450
At last.

84
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,010
You speak Korean better than I do.

85
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,440
I want to know the pattern.

86
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,420
Her husband died and said she wasn't shocked.

87
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,360
What an amazing wife.

88
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,560
Go and tell her that an autopsy is required

89
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,290
for a dead person who has no witnesses.

90
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,640
Put it in a nutshell.

91
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,040
I don't think my wife will be scared.

92
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,580
She would say,\N "I knew it would be like this",

93
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,640
"That's why I don't want to marry a cop".

94
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,700
A person who died for unknown reasons \Nin a place where no one saw him.

95
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,710
We need to open the body \Nand examine him.

96
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,740
That's the rule.

97
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,720
No, it is an order.

98
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,650
Is it easier if I say it like that?

99
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,980
More easily.

100
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:33,640
I told her to call the police.

101
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,120
I asked her if she could still laugh \Nwhen she saw the fracture.

102
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,850
And she still wanted to laugh.

103
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,919
This woman's body is very clean.

104
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,179
She's wounded in places that are out of sight.

105
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,360
Wait a minute. Give me the mouse.

106
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,510
What does my husband look\Nlike in real life?

107
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,240
Should I tell you in words? \Nor do you want to see in pictures?

108
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,200
Tell me.

109
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,310
No, pictures.

110
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,100
He was found with his eyes open,\Ndo you want to see it?

111
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,770
Head laceration is the\Nimmediate cause of death.

112
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,850
It's a crack in the head that killed him.

113
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,830
There should have been a lot of blood but \Nit was raining so it was washed away.

114
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,560
It's a blessing that he died\Nthe way he wanted to.

115
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,500
Isn't it fate?

116
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Did you see her laugh?

117
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,490
He's a clean guy.

118
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,420
There's nowhere to go.

119
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,420
Just let me die like this.

120
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,660
That's cruel.

121
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,230
Am I that bad?

122
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,490
Am I so wicked?

123
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,830
We're good, right?

124
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,030
Yeah.

125
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,760
We have been very happy for\N16 years and 8 months.

126
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,430
How can you count that?

127
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,340
As expected of science major.

128
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,440
They say sex is good for high blood \Npressure and heart disease.

129
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,940
I read the latest research that says \Nit's good for cognitive function too.

130
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,510
Oh, here we go again.

131
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,220
We're gonna do it every week.

132
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,710
Even when we hate each other.

133
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,960
So vicious.

134
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,900
You were just thinking \Nabout that, weren't you?

135
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,880
The Gilgok-dong incident.

136
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:18,850
No.

137
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,250
It's the case incident

138
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,710
of a young Chinese woman \Nwhose husband died in the mountains.

139
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,280
I feel bad for her husband.

140
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,160
Seo-Rae goes to different elderly people \Nthat are living alone from Monday to Friday.

141
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,410
You asked Monday, right?

142
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,670
Our patients may not be\Nable to express themselves very well,

143
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,160
So the person in charge \Nwill call one by one.

144
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,670
Yes, 9 a.m.... come here.

145
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,490
I can check if the caretaker

146
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,200
is there or not.

147
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,540
Song Seo-Rae.

148
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,310
Monday... oh, it's grandmother Lee Hae-Dong?

149
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,160
I also called to confirm that day.

150
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,200
I'm sorry but

151
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,860
Can someone who can't express \Ntheir feelings answer the phone?

152
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,650
Of course the caretaker picked it up.

153
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,180
How's Song Seo-Rae doing?

154
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,310
That's what our grandmothers said.

155
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,420
Is she a nurse or a granddaughter?

156
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,210
Because she is a nurse, \Nshe is very good at injections.

157
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,300
It's our company's ace. It's our ace.

158
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,500
She's a horrible woman.

159
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,800
Look at her. She's taken the ring off.

160
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,710
Isn't it sadness hits people like waves?

161
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,760
Just like the ink spreads, there will also \Nbe people who are slowly getting stained.

162
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,450
Let me know when you will\Npublish your book of poems.

163
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,060
I'll buy one.

164
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,190
Do you understand the bitterness of life?

165
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,180
Right?

166
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,550
You spend bitter weekends\Nwith a beautiful wife.

167
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,560
After sitting for 12 hours all day,

168
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,410
Screening out illegal immigrants is hard work.

169
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,080
But the thought of climbing a mountain

170
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,130
completely changes my mind.

171
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,260
- Then...\N- Come on.

172
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,880
They found someone else's DNA\Nunder Ki Do-Soo's fingernails.

173
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,320
We need to collect the epithelial cells \Nfrom her wife's mouth first.

174
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,560
Ah, this oral epithelial cells word.

175
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,070
How do we explain that to her?

176
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,630
When I think of something\Nthat's giving me a headache,

177
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,710
All of a sudden, all of my\Ngastrointestinal cells started to hurt.

178
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,860
Go and eat. Don't buy expensive food.

179
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,030
Really...

180
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,260
They found

181
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,320
someone else's DNA\Nunder Ki Do-Soo's fingernails.

182
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:44,090
Now, come to the police station \Nand give us some DNA.

183
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,860
I can't.

184
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,610
Why not?

185
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,020
I'm working.

186
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,460
Your husband's dead.

187
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,260
Looks like you're back at work.

188
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,660
My dead husband

189
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:00,380
must not get in the way of\Ncaring for the living elderly.

190
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,780
Ah, I see.

191
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,650
{\i1}Ah, tracking is my main specialty.{\i0}

192
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,370
I heard that you grew up in the hands of grandma, \Nso I entrusted Monday grandmother to you.

193
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,390
Do it well.

194
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,880
What time did Song Seo-Rae come on Monday?

195
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,000
Siri, play a song.

197
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,640
The song is great.

198
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,110
I got it from Seo-Rae.

199
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:53,530

203
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,970
I thought you couldn't come.

204
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,569
Thank you.

205
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,030
What do you like about Seo-Rae?

206
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:16,190
Because she's beautiful?

207
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,550
Because she peeled apples skin \Nvery thinly.

208
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,720
I've been praying since Friday night \Nto make Monday come faster.

209
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:31,740
That way, sometimes I think\NMonday really comes soon.

210
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,820
Sidi, play a song.

211
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,430
Jung Hoon Hee's Mist.

212
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,530
Isn't the song good?

213
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,250
I got it from Seo-Rae.

214
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,070
We fought.

215
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,420
My husband wants to climb the mountains.

216
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,110
I hate mountains.

217
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,850
Did he scratch you

218
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,070
because you were against \Nyour husband's climbing the mountain?

219
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,260
I'll call a policewoman.

220
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,680
It's okay.

221
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,950
I need to take a picture.

222
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,810
It's okay.

223
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,570
It's okay.

224
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,340
I did it.

225
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,600
Because he doesn't\Nunderstand my Korean.

226
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,190
After you hurt yourself,

227
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,330
did he understand?

228
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,380
At last.

229
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,590
What did your husband say \Nwhen he saw you hurt yourself?

230
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,380
So vicious.

231
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:12,920
Do-Soo is stopping me like this.

232
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,790
The DNA discovered under your \Nhusband's fingernails is therefore yours.

233
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:19,950
Is it?

234
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,210
Yes.

235
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,570
You hate mountains that much, Seo-Rae?

00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,790
I am not benevolent.

00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,510

00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,600
Yes, me too.

Yes?

These are the dates you go to\Nthe emergency room, right?

245
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:58,660
Is that because you don't want him\Nto go to the mountains and beat you up?

246
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,690
He is the only Korean

247
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,170
who shed tears after hearing my story.

248
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,750

Ah, I'm sorry.

00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,550
I shouldn't laugh.

253
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,500
Because you are too explicit.

254
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,100
When I'm not confident \Nin speaking Korean,

255
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,920
I laugh.

256

Thank you.

260
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,580
Did you eat well?

00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,770
No.

Is that a sushi deluxe set meal?

264
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,550

It's waterproof.

Waterproof means even if it is wet,

00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,450
the water can't get in.

270

on a cargo ship coming from Pyeongtaek Port.

277
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,660

Why would such a beautiful woman \Nmarry that old man and live in Korea?

350
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,310
Just because

351

you're young, beautiful, and foreign, \Ndo you want to become a suspect?

So you admit she's pretty.

353

It's reverse discrimination.

If the other person is not a\Nwoman or a foreigner,

00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,270
Hey, Soo-Wan.

489
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,310
Soo-Wan, let's go.

490
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:16,330
Yes.

491
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,730
- Will you?\N- Yeah.

492
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,750
Let's go home, rascal.

493
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,220
Hey, hyung.

494
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,230
Get up.

495
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,530
What's going on?

496
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:28,650
Let's go.

497
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,280
Oh?

498
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,710
Our group leader

499
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,500
Hey, let's go.

500
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,890
he looks a little wilted, but\N he's actually a pretty scary guy.

501
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:37,670
I'll catch you next time.

502
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:38,240
Let's go, let's go.

503
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:41,850
The next time you kill your husband, \Nyou have to take care.

504
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:42,540
Hey.

505
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,390
Hyung, I need to take my bag.

506
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:45,670
It's okay, it's okay. Let's go.

507
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:47,370
Go, go, go.

508
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,490
- I've made it simple enough, haven't I?\N- Let's go.

509
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,260
I went all the way to come to\NBusan because I respect you.

510
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,020
No, don't do it.

511
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:54,830
I have one question.

512
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,460
Don't ask.

513
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,380
Why did you treat that woman a sushi?

514
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:58,620
Crazy.

515
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,040
Seo-Rae, can you move your feet?

516
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:19,860
The incident case is closed.

517
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,820
Seo-Rae, you're no longer

518
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,550
a suspect.

519
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,350
Are you happy?

520
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,400
What?

521
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,100
Why would I?

522
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:36,190
You're right. I'm happy.

523
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,600
Why?

524
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:43,540
I just think...

525
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:45,870
We're no longer...

526
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,880
We?

527
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,520
What?

528
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,580
Have you had dinner yet?

529
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:08,550
What?

530
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:10,900
Ah, yes.

531
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:14,940
Ice cream?

532
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,860
The only cuisine I know and I can cook

533
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,620
is a Chinese Cuisine.

534
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,600
I do all sorts of things at night

535
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:42,080
due to insomnia

536
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,840
Ah, insomnia means you can't sleep.

537
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,880
Oh my... God.

538
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,370
Oh

539
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:06,820
Those are the unsolved cases

540
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,680
but I don't know when it'll be done so I just...

541
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,550
An unsolved case is a case that has not been solved.

542
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,930
Unsolved case.

543
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:22,110
Do ants eat people?

544
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:24,780
Ah, that...

545
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,610
The first thing that comes out is flies

546
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:30,450
Sooner or later, they'll be there in ten minutes.

547
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,870
After eating blood and secretions,

548
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:35,590
they'll lay eggs in wounds \Nor holes in the human body.

549
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,880
If maggots come out of there,

550
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,560
the ants will flock to eat the maggots.

551
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:45,150
And then the beetles, then wasps. \NThat's how they start eating humans.

552
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:01,810
But it tastes good.

553
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:06,640
I gave out a taste award

554
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,840
That's why you can't sleep.

555
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:15,550
Because of the bloodshot pictures \Nof the dead are screaming.

556
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,130
That man is Jeon Hyo-seok was found

557
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:21,450
on the mountain a month after his death.

558
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:24,880
The hand axe that smashed his \Nown head was next to him.

559
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:26,810
Hong San-Oh.

560
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,600
He is the real murderer of the \NGilgok-dong incident, but I can't catch him.

561
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,680
I look at these photos whenever I can.

562
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:37,450
After interviewing more than\Na dozen of his ex-girlfriends,

563
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,090
Now I feel that I've become very close to him.

564
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:44,540
Have he been in jail?

565
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,890
Yes, he have only lived for a month.

566
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:50,730
He mistakenly thought her girlfriend was \Ngoing to date another man, so he hit the man.

567
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,710
Is he more afraid of prison than death?

568
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:56,500
I know.

569
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:59,600
This guy actually beat someone \Nwith the consciousness of being in jail.

570
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:01,830
So it's the woman he loves to death.

571
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,300
Oh Ga-In?

572
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,460
He run away.

573
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:33,030
Go after him!

574
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:37,130
Hyung!

575
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,290
The bullets has been rotated!

576
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,040
Oh Ga-In lives far away though.

577
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,390
She opened a beauty salon in Gyeonggi-do.

578
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:57,230
And she got married.

579
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,070
In South Korea,

580
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:15,920
Do you stop liking someone you like \Nwhen they get married?

581
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,470
Hey, Hong San-Oh!

582
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,330
Hong San-Oh!

583
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:38,520
Hong...

584
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,190
You.

585
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,620
You didn't kill Bo-Mi for money, did you?

586
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,370
Right? I've know everything.

587
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:16,480
When you're in jail for a month,

588
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:19,210
Bo-Mi touched Oh Ga-In, didn't he?

589
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,600
Actually I...

590
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,400
But her husband beats her.

591
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,410
But the husband beat the woman

592
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,100
I really want to kill her husband.

593
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:44,380
Why do girls sleep with those trash guys?

594
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:45,530
I'm a trash too though.

595
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:46,760
I know!

596
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,570
No, why are you a trash?

597
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,930
You really love Ga-In.

598
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:55,890
Right?

599
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,240
Didn't you gave up everything \Nfor the sake of Ga-In? Motherfucker.

600
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:01,080
You gave up...

601
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,960
Please tell Ga-In...

602
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,040
Although I have suffered a lot because of her

603
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,450
Actually, without her, my life would be empty.

604
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,520
Please tell her so.

605
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,120
Hong San-Oh!

606
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:41,290
Don't do this!

607
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:45,440
Looks like you don't need to tell her.

608
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:51,660
{\i1}Are you okay?{\i0}

609
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,990
{\i1}Which cop will let someone like that \Ndrive home right away?{\i0}

610
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:57,790
{\i1}Do you want me to go to Busan?{\i0}

611
00:49:57,810 --> 00:49:59,670
No, no, there's no need to come.

612
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,950
{\i1}But still, whenever you cry, I...{\i0}

613
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,180
I'm not crying.

614
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,090
{\i1}Really?{\i0}

615
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:05,680
I have to go to the restroom.

616
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,780
{\i1}Oh, okay.{\i0}

617
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,100
I'm hanging up.

618
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:21,590
{\i1}After persistent inquiry, they finally found him.{\i0}

619
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:23,230
{\i1}After killing her husband, Mr. Kang,{\i0}

620
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,450
{\i1}It has been confirmed that he and Oh \Nhave been living together.{\i0}

621
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,160
Who is it?

622
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:32,210
You...

623
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,300
Ah, I told you no need to come...

624
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:37,860
What's the matter?

625
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:40,690
Because I want to put you to sleep.

626
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:44,100
Do you think I'm an old man who lives alone?

627
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:46,460
Are you going to squeeze my arms and shoulders?

628
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,090
What are you doing?

629
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,470
Didn't you say these are unsolved cases?

630
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:09,800
Oh.

631
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,760
I'll burn my husband's picture, too

632
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,930
This is too dark.

633
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,070
But still, you're pretty.

634
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,790
What did you say about me?

635
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,600
Try to say it in chinese.

636
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:29,650
You're pretty.

637
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:35,950
[ SPEAKS IN CHINESE ]

638
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,640
Then, you can have one.

639
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:49,930
I'll keep this.

640
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,150
This one too.

641
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:56,930
This one too.

642
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:01,410
This is better, isn't it?

643
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:17,060
Can you get a good night's sleep now?

644
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,060
I'm not sure.

645
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:23,980
I have a way.

646
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:25,760
Way?

647
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:30,380
I upgraded the U.S. Navy development.

648
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,070
I'm from the Navy though.

649
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,240
What has the U.S. Navy developed?

650
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:41,250
Close your eyes.

651
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:51,720
Do you really want my heart?

652
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:53,340
Heart?

653
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,690
What are you going to do with my heart?

654
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:58,050
Oh.

655
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,840
I mean I'll put you in ease,

656
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,420
not to get your heart.

657
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,860
I see.

658
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:07,470
Sleep.

659
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:16,200
Listen to the sound of my breathing.

660
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,330
Align your breathing with my breathing

661
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,180
Now you're going to the sea.

662
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,700
You went underwater.

663
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:48,530
You're a jellyfish.

664
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:52,550
You have no eyes nor nose.

665
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:56,120
You're not thinking anything as well.

666
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,020
You're not happy

667
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,770
nor sad.

668
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,190
You're emotionless.

669
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,210
You're pushing the water away

670
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,920
Push away everything that happened today

671
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:14,950
Push it to me.

672
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:26,640
Wait.

673
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,740
Korean women have a lot of trouble \Nwith their hands, don't they?

674
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,700
Don't caregivers not use gloves much?

675
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,020
The calluses on your hands are...

676
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,790
I felt good from the start.

677
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,020
Because the cop in charge of me has a class.

678
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:54,970
Are you saying that being a cop is classy?

679
00:55:58,030 --> 00:55:59,050
As a Korean?

680
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,660
What about boyfriend?

681
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,630
As a modern man.

682
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,400
Seo-Rae, what era are you from?

683
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:16,780
Tang Dynasty?

684
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:21,850
Why don't you ask me why I like you?

685
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:24,290
If you know, are you afraid of \Nalways thinking about it?

686
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:29,240
I already knew that you and I\Nwere of the same boat.

687
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,240
When I said I wanted to see\Nyour husband's picture

688
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:38,920
You're saying no

689
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:42,930
and I always

690
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,580
I will try my best to look good.

691
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:56,230
If you look at the body in the crime scene, \Nhalf of the corpses were eyed-open.

692
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:00,410
I promise I'll catch the last one \Nthey saw with those eyes.

693
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:10,420
What I'm afraid of is \Na crime scene with a lot of blood.

694
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,380
Because of the smell.

695
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:19,940
Oh?

696
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,980
That's why you always wear\Ngood-smelling hand cream, isn't it?

697
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:30,860
Do you have anything else with you?

698
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:53,320
Seo-Rae, what are you afraid of?

699
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,610
Because you're a nurse, \Nit can't be blood.

700
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,950
Heights.

701
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:58,480
I see.

702
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:02,920
Your pockets...

703
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:05,160
I have 12 on the jacket and 6 on my pants.

704
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:06,880
It was made to order at the\Nstore I always go to.

705
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:09,480
Because I've helped them with cases, \Nso they give me a discount.

706
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:11,470
Because I had to go directly to the scene,

707
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,780
I would wear this on my day off.

708
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:15,770
It's not like a person can't kill someone \Neven if it's a day off, right?

709
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,150
I don't always wear the same clothes, \Ndon't get me wrong.

710
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,140
I have a lot of clothes.

711
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:19,830
I'm...

712
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,080
a neat person.

713
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:31,960
{\i1}She unfold the book and notebook side by side.{\i0}

714
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:33,910
{\i1}No matter how many hours \Nshe spend, she keep writing.{\i0}

715
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,270
{\i1}Even though she's writing,{\i0}

716
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:38,660
{\i1}She often look at her phone.{\i0}

717
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,170
{\i1}Or maybe she's looking at a\Ndictionary for translation.{\i0}

718
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:44,030
{\i1}She's watching drama again.{\i0}

719
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:46,560
{\i1}Talking to herself while watching.{\i0}

720
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:49,040
{\i1}Is it because you watch historical drama{\i0}

721
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:50,920
{\i1}that you speak in an old-fashioned way?{\i0}

722
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,860
{\i1}She's eating ice cream again for dinner.{\i0}

723
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:55,530
{\i1}It's not okay to smoke after a meal.{\i0}

724
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,710
She's crying...at last.

725
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:04,380
Oh, shit.

726
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:06,760
I know that's a swear word.

727
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,100
In front of the Buddha, it's really...

728
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,120
You'll delete the recordings

729
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,270
after you solve the incident case, right?

730
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,120
Of course.

731
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:44,530
You password is the day\Nyour mother died, right?

732
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,430
If you memorize event-related numbers,

733
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,600
There are many times when it's helpful.

734
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,970
Because the case is closed

735
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,400
So I will also forget the case number.

736

01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:00,050
I smell cigarette.

747
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:02,370
You must have smoked.

748
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,200
Cigarette!

there is a mountain of oil.

Looks like you two went somewhere.

01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:04,310
I stayed at home for over ten years.

{\i1}But it takes about the same amount \Nof time to reach the top.{\i0}

813
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:39,410
Although I have been climbing the difficult route

814
01:06:39,690 --> 01:06:41,650
{\i1}Today, especially for newbie friends,{\i0}

815
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,910
{\i1}I'll take the easy route.{\i0}

816
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:47,400
{\i1}Song Seo-Rae must have chosen the easy route.{\i0}

817
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:49,580
{\i1}Because she can't be seen by her husband.{\i0}

818
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:52,540
All right, Chief. I'm on my way to work.

819
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:53,520
Yes?

820
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:54,750
I'm okay.

821
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:55,950
Yes.

822
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:05,410
9:00 AM. Elderly Care calls \Nto confirm her whereabouts.

823
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:10,620
{\i1}You don't have to be ashamed \Nto slip in a place like this.{\i0}

824
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:14,050
{\i1}Bird Peak was originally known as Oil and Water Peak.{\i0}

825
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:18,660
{\i1}It's as smooth as oil. That's why it's called oil peak.{\i0}

826
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:36,460
{\i1}Isn't the scenery is very pleasant?{\i0}

827
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,490
{\i1}If you start listening to Mahler's Fifth Symphony{\i0}

828
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:42,560
{\i1}you will arrive at the end of the fourth movement.{\i0}

829
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:44,360
{\i1}Sitting on the top of the\Nmountain and listening to{\i0}

830
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:46,370
{\i1}Mahler's Fifth Symphony and\Nthen going down the mountain.{\i0}

831
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:48,050
Isn't it perfect?

833

Song Seo-Rae must have been\Nhiding here and reached the top

834
01:07:56,070 --> 01:07:58,280
{\i1}before the end of the fifth movement \Nof Mahler's Fifth Symphony.{\i0}

835
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,590
{\i1}The final line of the fifth movement \Nwill encounter some difficulties.{\i0}

836
01:08:31,830 --> 01:08:33,130

839

{\i1}It's like eating sushi with a dip.{\i0}

840
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:48,540
{\i1}If you grab the ladder and climb up,{\i0}

841
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:53,240
{\i1}you will not notice that your body \Nhas already reached the top.{\i0}

The dirty world is far away.

847
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:18,410
It's good that I died like this.

848
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,450
Aren't you afraid of heights?

849
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,780
Why is he beaten like that?

850
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,430
And branded like a domestic animal

851
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:10,820
You didn't call the police.

852
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:14,270
Why don't you trust the police?

853
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:19,060
He said he would send me back

854
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:20,860
to China.

855
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:25,080
Is that why you sent threatening\Nletters to your husband?

856
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:33,000
That letter will never be strange \Nno matter when it is sent.

857
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:34,920
Because everything is true.

858
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:43,540
You wrote the letter that Ki Do-Soo \Nsent to the immigration office?

859
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:47,560
But the address and name on \Nthe envelope are handwritten.

860
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,430
How did you do it?

861
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:21,620
I just revised the defense\Nwritten by the husband.

862
01:12:23,050 --> 01:12:25,580
and changed it to look like a suicide note.

863
01:12:26,450 --> 01:12:30,200
So it's not true that Soo-Wan \Nis violent to you, right?

864
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:35,840
Isn't it violent for the police

865
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:37,850
to go to a woman's house after drinking?

866
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:43,440
All the photos are burned.

867
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:46,080
I deleted all the files I recorded.

868
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:48,400
That must be easy for you.

869
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:50,430
You pretended to like me,

870
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,400
so that I'll take care of everything for you.

871
01:13:03,930 --> 01:13:06,190
Don't speak about \Nour time that way.

01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:08,540
Us?

873
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:11,470
What kind of time was that?

874
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:19,510
The time I spent outside\Nyour home each night?

875
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:24,800
Listening to your breathing\Nand falling asleep?

876
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:28,710
Whispering happiness in your ear \Nwhile holding you?

877
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:48,320
You said I have a taste.

878
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,810
Do you know where is my taste comes from?

879
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,140
It comes from my pride.

880
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:59,530
I'm a very confident cop.

881
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:06,010
But it's been crazy lately.

882
01:14:11,010 --> 01:14:12,410
The investigation was sabotaged, right?

883
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:16,850
What about me?

01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,060
I'm completely broken.

885
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:33,020
You changed my grandma's phone

886
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:35,480
and replaced it with the same model.

887
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:37,730
She didn't notice at all.

888
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,320
Throw that phone into the sea.

889
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:48,650
Throw it into the deep sea.

890
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,540

There is no sun here in the morning.

970
01:20:39,290 --> 01:20:40,290
Did you changed your number again?

971
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:42,170
{\i1}Ah, hurry up and pack.{\i0}

972
01:20:42,190 --> 01:20:43,940
{\i1}Chul-Sung has found out\Nwhere we are.{\i0}

973
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:45,630
{\i1}And next week,{\i0}

974
01:20:45,650 --> 01:20:47,070
{\i1}you'll help me host the Chinese.{\i0}

975
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:50,390
{\i1}If they can't get through to \NChina, it'll be hard for me.{\i0}

976
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:51,600
{\i1}Oh? What did you send?{\i0}

977
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,460
{\i1}So he have already been there.{\i0}

978
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:57,680
{\i1}I don't think we'll be able to\Nsee anyone for a while.{\i0}

979
01:20:59,850 --> 01:21:00,350
{\i1}I love you.{\i0}

980
01:21:01,070 --> 01:21:02,370
We're good, right?

981
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:03,900
Let's forget about Chul-Sung.

982
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:06,320
Let's move first.

983
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:07,520
We have to.

984
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:09,500
Now that Chul-Sung have found you

985
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:11,520
Where do you want to move?

986
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:33,410
What's going on?

987
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:34,380
Is this a real fire?

988
01:21:34,410 --> 01:21:36,140
or just a fire drill.

989
01:21:37,370 --> 01:21:39,230
If it's a fake fire this time,\Nnobody's coming out next time.

990
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:56,330
People say you're here because of depression.

991
01:21:56,850 --> 01:21:58,380
Because you failed to stop\Ncriminals from committing suicide.

992
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:02,160
But now you're cured.

993
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:05,740
Do you think I'm still depressed?

994
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:10,790
That's because I can't sleep well, \Nthat's the reason.

995
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:13,980
He's wearing shoes?

996
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:16,900
You're not even smoking,\Nwhy don't you go in?

997
01:22:17,670 --> 01:22:18,890
Did you come to accompany me \Nbecause you saw me alone?

998
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:24,360
It's really quiet in the \Nremote mountain village.

999
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:28,770
If you want to smoke, \Ngo outside and smoke.

1000
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:35,650
I love you.

1001
01:23:08,610 --> 01:23:09,230
What are you doing here?

1002
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:10,230
I just moved in.

1003
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:11,130
Why?

1004
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,380
There's nothing to see here.

1005
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:18,370
I like the fog.

1006
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:20,870
I'm Song Seo-Rae.

1007
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:24,260
I'm Chinese so I don't speak\NKorean very well.

1008
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:28,670
Honey.

1009
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:32,030
Honey, this is the detective\Nwho suspected me.

1010
01:23:32,370 --> 01:23:35,720
Ah, I am her "next husband".

1011
01:23:36,770 --> 01:23:37,610
I'm Im Ho-Shin.

1012
01:23:40,330 --> 01:23:41,210
I'm Jang Hae-Joon.

1013
01:23:42,530 --> 01:23:43,700
Why did you come to Lipo?

1014
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:54,970
I just touched the fish.

1015
01:23:59,150 --> 01:24:00,570
Why did you come to Lipo?

1016
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:02,860
I just moved in as well.

1017
01:24:03,410 --> 01:24:04,630
My wife works here.

1018
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:10,830
I'm Ahn Jung-An.

1019
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:14,310
I've only heard of people \Nleaving here because of fog.

1020
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:16,130
I've never heard of people \Ncoming here because of fog.

1021
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:19,720
Wait until you've seen how \Nmoldy this place is.

1022
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:24,190
Honey, really you are.

1023
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:33,050
Actually, we came here\Nbecause of the nuclear power plant.

1024
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:35,280
What? What's wrong?

1025
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:36,640
The red alert?

1026
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:41,250
Woo Bin starred in a drama about \Nsolving the nuclear leakage accident.

1027
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:45,680
Chinese women travel great distances\Njust to see the filming location.

1028
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:48,040
Doesn't she need a tour guide?

1029
01:24:49,230 --> 01:24:51,350
Now that you're making money \Nfrom that point of sale,

1030
01:24:51,370 --> 01:24:53,440
I shouldn't have said this but

1031
01:24:54,110 --> 01:24:56,920
A TV drama featuring a\Ngroundless nuclear crisis

1032
01:24:56,940 --> 01:24:58,560
is really giving us a headache.

1033
01:24:59,230 --> 01:25:01,350
Ah, she works at a nuclear power plant.

1034
01:25:02,190 --> 01:25:03,590
She's quite sensitive to such issues.

1035
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:05,760
Actually,

1036
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:07,940
Nuclear power is completely safe.

1037
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:18,320
Ah, have you ever been on a\Nstock market show?

1038
01:25:18,730 --> 01:25:19,460
You've seen it.

1039
01:25:20,670 --> 01:25:22,110
I am a stock market analyst.

1040
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,980
It's not an anal analyst in\Nkorean word who likes the anus.

1041
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:37,310
You look younger than I saw you on TV.

1042
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,030
Swimming in morning is my\Nsecret to staying young.

1043
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:44,860
If you want to know \Nthe investment tips,

1044
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:46,920
Feel free to contact me anytime.

1045
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:49,100
Please give me your business card too.

1046
01:25:49,130 --> 01:25:50,930
Your business card is gorgeous...

1047
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:11,990
You don't have to run here.

1048
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:32,920
What a beautiful woman.

1049
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:35,430
Well,

1050
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:37,800
the green coat is beautiful.

1051
01:26:38,230 --> 01:26:39,230
Isn't it color blue?

1052
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,480
Whatever the color.

1053
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:45,770
She's a chinese woman who\Nhas been widowed.

1054
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:48,160
Have I heard about that case?

1055
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:53,250
I remember hearing about a\Ncase where a Chinese wife

1056
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,850
committed suicide and \Nbecame a widower.

1057
01:26:58,310 --> 01:26:59,600
There was a case like that.

1058
01:27:00,710 --> 01:27:02,350
Her last husband was a\Ncriminal, wasn't he?

1059
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:04,180
No.

1060
01:27:04,690 --> 01:27:06,560
I suspect the wrong person.

1061
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:09,080
Didn't you doubt that woman too?

1062
01:27:10,130 --> 01:27:10,690
Yeah.

1063
01:27:11,450 --> 01:27:13,490
But it turns out that her\Nhusband died by suicide.

1064
01:27:14,370 --> 01:27:16,620
Why do you always suspect\Nthe wrong people?

1065
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:19,370
That's why people hate us.

1066
01:27:21,490 --> 01:27:22,490
Us?

1067
01:27:24,350 --> 01:27:25,350
Us, the police.

1068
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:49,250
{\i1}[DETECTIVE YEO YEON-SOO]{\i0}

1069
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:51,100
Honey, answer the phone for me.

1070
01:27:54,510 --> 01:27:55,560
My hands are covered in blood.

1071
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:58,640
Hello?

1072
01:28:02,530 --> 01:28:03,530
Honey.

1073
01:28:04,990 --> 01:28:05,770
Congratulations.

1074
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:09,830
There's a murder.

1075
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:18,460
The estimated time of death is 11:00.

1076
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:20,250
Presumed to have been\Nstabbed 17 times.

1077
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,630
There are 13 stabs in the\Nstomach and chest.

1078
01:28:25,570 --> 01:28:26,390
4 stabs on back.

1079
01:28:27,190 --> 01:28:29,120
He must be stabbed in the\Nback when you ran away.

1080
01:28:30,530 --> 01:28:33,150
Can someone run away with 13 stabbings?

1081
01:28:34,170 --> 01:28:37,310
By the way, why is the corpse\N in that position?

1082
01:28:38,410 --> 01:28:39,930
The first person to find him\Nwas his wife.

1083
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:41,750
Team leader, should I bring her here?

1084
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:23,660
The suspect is left-handed.

1085
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:28,190
Write down.

1086
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:50,490
That's why you came to Lipo?

1087
01:29:50,910 --> 01:29:52,220
Am I such a pushover?

1088
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:57,430
Am I so wicked?

1089
01:30:10,150 --> 01:30:11,520
Song Seo-Rae, listen carefully.

1090
01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:14,380
An alibi this time

1091
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:17,770
should be as hard as under the eaves.

1092
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:24,720
Do you think his wife is the murderer?

1093
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:25,810
Why?

1094
01:30:26,490 --> 01:30:27,910
Because there's no sign of invasion,\Nno sign of theft,

1095
01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:29,200
no sign of binding?

1096
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:32,140
Because of sudden frontal stabbing

1097
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:34,960
Do you think this is a\Nvengeful killing?

1098
01:30:35,890 --> 01:30:38,080
Or maybe because his wife\Nwasn't shocked or sad?

1099
01:30:39,510 --> 01:30:41,960
It varies from person to person, \Nsome people grieve like waves...

1100
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:45,690
Why do you always ask me questions?

1101
01:30:45,890 --> 01:30:47,180
Why didn't you ask to\Nanyone else like that?

1102
01:30:52,330 --> 01:30:54,720
I met her in Busan last year\Nbecause of the incident case.

1103
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:57,060
It was also because her husband died.

1104
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,030
Did she kill him?

1105
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:04,960
I suddenly wondered if she\Nmight be the killer.

1106
01:31:05,330 --> 01:31:06,850
That case was classified as a suicide.

1107
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:09,640
And yet again, her husband died here, \Nand still under my jurisdiction.

1108
01:31:10,490 --> 01:31:11,670
But she's right-handed.

1109
01:31:12,910 --> 01:31:14,370
So think about it.

1110
01:31:14,390 --> 01:31:16,060
How could she be a criminal?

1111
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:22,910
They want me to go \Nto the police station

1112
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,670
Can I take my handbag out?

1113
01:31:28,820 --> 01:31:30,130
You went for a walk.

1114
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:33,860
And you don't have a cell phone with you, \Nso you have no way to track your location,

1115
01:31:34,170 --> 01:31:35,680
Do you have way to prove your alibi?

1116
01:31:36,580 --> 01:31:37,460
I know.

1117
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:41,200
It doesn't look like you're worried.

1118
01:31:43,150 --> 01:31:45,400
Does your husband ever had\Na grudge against anyone?

1119
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,140
I heard that he borrowed\Nother people's money

1120
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:49,800
to invest a lot and\Nstill lost a lot of money.

1121
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:52,770
He have lost a lot of money lately.

1122
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:55,540
He lost money and still \Nlive in a high-end villa.

1123
01:31:56,370 --> 01:31:59,010
You have to see how much\Nmoney you spend to save money.

1124
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:04,820
Ah, why did you marry such a man?

1125
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:09,040
I married a man

1126
01:32:09,870 --> 01:32:13,880
to make up my mind about\N breaking up with him.

1127
01:32:21,010 --> 01:32:23,110

We're here for no reason.

You don't marry your husband\Nsimply because you love him.

1131
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:47,590
Your husband is threatened everywhere.

01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:49,500
And later on, die.

1133

What?

1135
01:32:54,890 --> 01:32:56,650
My previous husband \Ncommitted suicide.

1136
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,650
How can it be the same \Nto my recent husband?

1137
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:03,540
Okay.

1138
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:07,650

01:33:08,210 --> 01:33:10,070

One committed suicide \Nand one was killed.

1142
01:33:17,790 --> 01:33:19,330
If people hear something like this,

1143
01:33:19,650 --> 01:33:20,890
I'm sure they thinks so too

1144
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,340
that's such a coincidence.

1146

What a poor woman.

It's not this one, it's a blue dress.

1148
01:34:26,950 --> 01:34:27,820
There's no coat too.

1149
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:29,430
Are you sure it's blue?

1150
01:34:30,260 --> 01:34:31,110
Not green?

1151
01:34:31,930 --> 01:34:32,680
Thank you.

1152
01:34:37,580 --> 01:34:38,660
She's right, it's blue.

Why do you keep asking?

1157
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:03,570
Does it matter to you why I'm here?

1158
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:10,660
Why is that important?

1159
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:19,240
This is the only way I can see you. \NWhat can I do?

01:35:27,580 --> 01:35:29,440

You're lying.

01:35:35,290 --> 01:35:36,940
Where is the green dress?

1164
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:39,060
The green one that looks blue.

1165
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:41,390
With shiny buttons.

My mother has been running \Na food stall for ten years,

for eighteen hours a day in this island.

1215

I trusted Lin Ho-shin \Nwith all that money.

1216
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:10,630
At first, I only put 10 million won.

Because she didn't get the\Nproper treatment,

01:40:50,550 --> 01:40:53,820
Hitting someone with a slap is lighter than \Nhitting someone with a fist.

On the morning of your mother's death, \Ndid you saw Song Seo-Rae?

1459
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:09,940
She came early in the\Nmorning to visit.

1460
01:59:12,810 --> 01:59:17,220
She said that she felt bad\Nfor my mother left like that.

1461
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:20,310
After all, we're all Chinese

1462
01:59:21,330 --> 01:59:23,360
Didn't she advise her to take any medicine?

1463
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:25,780
Something that is good for diabetes.

1464
01:59:27,340 --> 01:59:28,600
It's a green capsule.

1465
01:59:29,240 --> 01:59:30,290
Compared to that,

1466
01:59:31,090 --> 01:59:33,930
That woman knows how to\Ntake care her patients.

1467
01:59:34,590 --> 01:59:37,910
She rub her here and there,\Nand my mom was in such a good mood.

1468
01:59:38,780 --> 01:59:40,790
So I went out for breakfast, too.

1469
01:59:41,860 --> 01:59:44,030
Later, I found out that \NSong Seo-Rae has already left.

1470
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:47,540
Mother lay off comfortably\Nwith her eyes closed.

1471
01:59:48,140 --> 01:59:50,940
It's weird but she feel drowsy for no reason.

1472
01:59:52,820 --> 01:59:53,940
And then...

1473
01:59:57,850 --> 02:00:02,800
But what does my mother's death \Nhave to do with Song's rub?

1474
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:09,930
Didn't Chul-Sung say he had \Nlocation software installed on his phone?

1475
02:00:20,700 --> 02:00:21,460
Hello, Hae-Joon.

1476
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:24,040
I repaired Im Ho-Shin's phone privately.

1477
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:26,020
There are no voice recordings at all.

1478
02:00:27,790 --> 02:00:29,650
It's true that the one who killed \Nyour husband was Chung-Sung.

1479
02:00:29,870 --> 02:00:32,010
But you killed Chul-Sung's mother.

1480
02:00:32,990 --> 02:00:36,290
Because Chul-Sung said he'd kill your husband \Nif his mother died.

1481
02:00:38,750 --> 02:00:41,480
Your husband and Chul-Sung's mother.

1482
02:00:46,040 --> 02:00:47,370
Did you kill her because of me, isn't it?

1483
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:55,020
She's a dying person anyway

1484
02:00:55,810 --> 02:00:58,070
but why are you so anxious\Nthat you gave her fentanyl?

1485
02:00:59,690 --> 02:01:01,470
Because she said thank you.

1486
02:01:09,660 --> 02:01:11,600
What is the recording that Im Ho-Shin said \Nhe was going to reveal?

1487
02:01:12,710 --> 02:01:14,260
Don't worry about that.

1488
02:01:15,240 --> 02:01:17,200
I'm not asking that \Nbecause I'm worried.

1489
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:19,600
You've got the original, haven't you?

1490
02:01:20,370 --> 02:01:21,300
What is it?

1491
02:01:23,010 --> 02:01:24,450
It's your voice.

1492
02:01:25,290 --> 02:01:25,830
What?

1493
02:01:28,190 --> 02:01:30,740
The record of your voice\Nsaying you love me.

1494
02:01:35,620 --> 02:01:36,640
Did I?

1495
02:01:39,050 --> 02:01:41,280
Because I like it so much, \NI keep listening.

1496
02:01:44,140 --> 02:01:46,020
My husband found out.

1497
02:01:49,120 --> 02:01:50,680
When did I say I love you?

1498
02:01:54,080 --> 02:01:54,760
When?

1499
02:02:11,620 --> 02:02:13,270
The moment you said you loved me,

1500
02:02:14,090 --> 02:02:15,950
Your love is over.

1501
02:02:19,990 --> 02:02:21,890

1502
