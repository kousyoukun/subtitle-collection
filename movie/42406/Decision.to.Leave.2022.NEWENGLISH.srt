The Seven Lucky Caves Case

3
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,050
We have to catch one of the two men

4
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,640
But the director and the group didn't hear it.

5
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,060
What to do?

6
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,570
It's up to us to handle the case

7
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,870
- We?
- Yeah.

8
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,950

Request for refund of last year's advance

11
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:33,920
Yeah, that's right.

12
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,290
It wasn't allowed.

13
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:39,670
I told him to ask his boss, and then I texted you, Officer.

14
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,340
Nice job.

15
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,130
I was shown the picture a long time ago

16
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,300
I don't know how it suddenly came to me

17
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,310
Did he say he would come back?

Is it comfortable to leave me alone at home on weekends?

19
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,070
Is that what you told me, you and me?

20
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:05,610
I've got to get married too, damn it.

21
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,280
Did you snooze again?

22
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,200
Why did you stop talking in the middle of the sentence?

23
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:10,790
Keep talking

24
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:16,920
So get some sleep at night. It's too dangerous.

25
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,920
You don't get enough sleep because you're doing latent work all day.

26
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,460
It's not the lurking work that's causing the lack of sleep.

(Iripo Atomic Power Plant, Iripo)
It's because I can't sleep that I'm doing latent work.

He was very busy with the Math Olympiad.

Why does a junior high school student work so hard?

He's a science major, so it's up to me.

I understand him super well

34
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,160
Just order any sushi you want.

35
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,290
I don't want to eat that kind of bad sushi.

36

I want to make you something hot while I'm here.

Can't you transfer to Iripo?

38
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,800
I want to have hot soup every day.

39

My neighbor, Director Li, is the jealous one.

40

Yeah

41
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,390
Pretending to worry about me, but secretly embarrassing me

42

She said six out of ten weekend couples have serious divorce problems.

43
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,310
She asked me how I was doing.

44
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,280
And then what did you answer?

45
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,900
I said that 55% of sexless couples get divorced

46
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,820
Ask her how she's doing.

47
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,930
Grabbed the rope and climbed to the top of the mountain

48
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,100
Fell from the top of the mountain. There was a collision.

49
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:02,020
That way, that way, that way.

50
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,150

Is the helicopter coming later?

55
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:28,590
They said you could walk up there. Why do you have to go up like that?

56
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,760
Because it's the road that the dead walked on and we're the police.

57
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,350
And did we fall down when we came down?

58
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,430
Three more collisions

59
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,310
Why do people go up from such places?

60
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,190
It should be prohibited by law

61

Your father's body is here.

I am Song Seo-rae, wife of Kido Soo

75
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,350
I'm Chinese, so my Korean is a little rusty.

76
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,850
You must be in shock.

77
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:56,650
I was worried when I didn't come back from the mountain.

78
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,450
I was afraid that he would finally die

79
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,370
At last

80
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,040
I speak Korean better than I do.

81

The husband is dead, but he's not scared.

83
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,710
What an amazing wife.

84
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:54,300
Go over there and tell her that a dead man without a witness needs an autopsy.

85
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,550
Explain in simple words

86
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:08,270
I guess my wife wouldn't be shocked

87
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,690
It should say, "I knew this would happen."

88
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,020
That's why you don't want to marry a cop.

A person who died for unknown reasons in a place where no one could see him

90
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,240
Need to open the body and check it out. That's the rule.

91
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,490
That's not true.

92
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,120
It's a set order

93
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,040
Is it easier to say that?

94
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,170
It's a little bit simpler.

95
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,710
I told her to call the police.

96
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,170
I asked her if she could still laugh when she saw the fracture

97
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,920
And she wanted to laugh.

98
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,050
This man is very clean.

99
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,430
Wounded in places that are invisible

100

- Wait, give me the mouse.
- Hmm.

What did my husband's death look like?

102
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:05,200
I'll explain it to you in words or do you want to see the pictures

103
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,120
Explain it in words.

104
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,620
Okay.

Photo

106
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,840
Found with eyes open

107
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,590
Do you dare to look?

108
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:23,260
Head laceration as a direct cause of death

109
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,760
It's the laceration of the head that causes death.

110
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,850
It must have bled a lot, but the rain washed it all away.

111
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,480
It's a blessing.

112
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,770
He died the way he wanted to.

113
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,990
It's fate, isn't it?

114
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,030
Did you see her smile?

115
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,830
He's very clean.

116
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,520
I have nowhere else to go.

117
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,150
Just let me die like this

118
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:23,280
How cruel.

119
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,280
Am I such a bad woman?

120
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,370
Am I that bad?

121
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,090
- It was fun, right?
- I am.

122
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:46,010
We've been having fun for 16 years and 8 months, right?

123
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,800
Why are you still counting the time?

124
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,720
It's a science subject

125
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,140
I heard that sex is good for high blood pressure and heart disease

126
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,650
I've read that the latest research says it's good for cognitive performance, too.

127
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,030
That's amazing.

128
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,110
We're gonna do it every week.

129
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,410
We're gonna do it even when we hate each other

130
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,080
That's mean.

131
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,370
You were thinking about that too, weren't you?

None

134

It's the case of a young Chinese woman who died in the mountains

135
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,800
Her elderly husband was miserable

(Granddaughter elderly care)

137
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,560
(Granddaughter care for the elderly)
You're asking about Monday, right?

138
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,690
(Granddaughter elderly care)
Our patients are unable to express themselves clearly

139
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,150
(Granddaughter elderly care)
So our director will call one by one

140
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:46,530
9:00 a.m. Come on over.

141
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:52,030
So I can confirm if the nurse is there or not.

142
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:56,700
Song Rilai, if Monday...

143
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,000
It's Lee Hye-dong's grandmother's house. I also called that day to confirm.

144
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,210
I'm sorry

145
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:06,710
Can people who can't express their thoughts still answer the phone?

146
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,880
Of course the nurse will answer the phone

147
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:16,430
How is Song Rilai's usual condition?

148
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:24,820
Our grandmother said that. 00:12:16,430 Is she a caregiver or a granddaughter

149
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,280
Because she's a nurse, she's very good at giving shots.

150
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,830
She's the ace of our company. The ace.

151
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:38,450
She's a very scary woman.

152
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,830
You can see she's taken the ring off.

153
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,680
There are those who grieve like a tidal wave

154
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:58,020
Some grief slowly spreads like ink

155
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,890
Let me know when you publish a book of poems

156
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,440
I want to buy a copy

157
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,310
Do you understand the bitterness of life?

158
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:09,860
Yeah, the bitterness of spending every weekend with a beautiful wife.

159
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,280
Sitting for 12 hours a day

160
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,740
It's a tough job screening out illegal aliens

161
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:19,450
But the thought of climbing a mountain changes my mood completely.

162
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,330
Come on...

163
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,960
The DNA of other people appeared under Kido's fingernails.

164
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,300
We have to collect her wife's oral epithelial cells first.

165
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,510
Oral epithelial cells?

166
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:38,180
How do I explain this to her?

167
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,730
The thought of a headache

168
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:45,190
And suddenly the epithelium of the stomach started to hurt

169
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,360
Let's go eat.

170
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,020
Don't eat the expensive ones

171
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,650
Really

172
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:39,800
We found other people's DNA under Kido's fingernails.

173
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:45,970
You'll have to come to the police station and give us your DNA.

174
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,810
No, you can't.

175
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:48,640
Why

176
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,150
I'm working.

177
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:54,980
Your husband is dead and you're going to work so soon.

178
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:02,990
A deceased husband doesn't prevent me from taking care of the old people who are still alive.

179
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,790
Yes

180
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,710
Tailgating is my specialty.

181
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,420
I heard you were raised by your grandmother, so I gave it to you.

182
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,880
You do a good job.

183
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,550
What time did Song Rilai come in on Monday?

184
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:24,600
SIRI Playing music by Jung Hyun-hee's fog

185
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,480
Nice music, isn't it?

186
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,060
I got it from Riley.

187
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:06,470
I thought you couldn't make it. Thanks.

188
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,940
What do you like about Riley? Is it the beauty?

189
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:21,700
Because she peels the apples very thinly.

190
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,450
I've been praying since Friday night.

191
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,990
Praying for Monday to come quickly

192
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:32,830
That way occasionally I think Monday will really come soon

193
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:42,300
SIRI Playing music by Jung Kaoruji's Fog

194
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:49,310
The music is very nice, right? Siren helped me download it.

195
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,640
We had a fight.

196
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,480
My husband wants to climb a mountain and I don't like mountains

197
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,150
Because you don't like mountains, he tickles you?

198
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,740
I'll call the policewoman.

199
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,740
It's okay.

200
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,040
Photo required

201
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,680
Never mind.

202
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,600
It doesn't matter.

203
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,530
I scratched it.

204
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,870
Because he couldn't understand my Korean.

205
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,410
Did he understand after you hurt yourself?

206
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,120
Finally

207
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,290
What did your husband say after he saw you hurt yourself?

208
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,170
How cruel.

209
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:14,220
Du Xiu persuaded me to do this

210
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:19,150
So your husband's DNA appeared under his fingernails.

211
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,560
Is that right?

212
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,230
Yeah.

213
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,030
Do you hate mountains that much?

214
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:30,280
Confucius said, "The wise man enjoys the water, the benevolent man enjoys the mountains.

215
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,370
I'm not a benevolent person. I like the sea.

216
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:40,130
Confucius said that the wise man enjoys the water and the benevolent man enjoys the mountains

217
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:44,710
I'm not a benevolent person. I like the sea.

218
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,590
Me too

219
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,130
What

220
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:55,020
These are the dates of the emergency room visits, right?

221
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:00,060
This is also because you don't want to go to the mountain and beat you up?

222
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,980
He's the only one

223
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,110
Korean who shed tears after hearing my story

224
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,610
What kind of Koreans

225
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,330
The only one

226
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,090
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have laughed.

227
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,130
You're too explicit

228
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:32,800
I also laugh when I'm not confident in speaking Korean

229
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,820
I'm going to order dinner.

230
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,840
How's that? Is that okay?

231
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,510
Yeah, thanks.

232
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,510
It's delicious.

233
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:29,320
Is that a sushi deluxe set? Can you reimburse me?

234
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,190
Follow me, please.

235
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,780
We'll be back.

236
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,580
This is waterproof

237
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:31,460
Waterproof means it won't go in even if it touches water

238
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,640
The nurses will use a lot of waterproof supplies

239
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:43,480
Please re-enter that room by 6:50.

240
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,900
The women's bathroom is on the right hand side here

241
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:33,230
August 17, 2015

242
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:37,200
Marine police on a cargo ship coming in from the port of Pyeongtaek

243
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,030
Chinese illegally entering the country were found

244
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:47,830
The rest 27 were deported. Only you stayed here.

245
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:51,540
Because I'm not like the others

246
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:59,470
My maternal grandfather was Mr. Gui Feng Shi of the Manchu Korean Liberation Army

247
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,550
What

248
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:12,730
Thanks to Kido Soo, he got the Founding Medal.

249
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,700
I

250
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,960
Okay, I'll be there in 10 minutes.

251
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,130
- Lee Jigu has appeared. Brother's Internet Cafe.
- Okay

252
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,970
Release Song Seo-rae.

253
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:43,470
You investigate the Gui Feng Shi who received the Order of Founding

254
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,140
Okay

255
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,560
Even if you don't shoot, you'll feel better with it.

256
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,750
Lee Jigu

257
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,090
- Gui Feng Shi
- Li Zhijiu

258
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,220
Mid-1930s in the area of Nanmanju

259
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,810
As an active participant in the armed war against Japan

260
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:30,890
Lieutenant of the Korean Liberation Army

261
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:33,900
Conducted over 200 military operations, large and small

262
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,020
nicknamed the Wildcat of Southern Manchuria

263
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,320
During a sneak attack on Japanese troops in Yanbian, China

264
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,240
bit the neck of the company commander and was therefore beheaded

265
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,370
This incident became a legend and was passed down

266
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:02,050
Lee Jigu, that bastard!

267
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,800
It's killing me.

268
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,080
Letting go

269
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,870
Just let go.

270
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,540
I told you to let go.

271
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,050
Letting go

272
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:54,740
Why is it so dark?

273
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,700
What do you want?

274
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,500
You get up.

275
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,670
Why did you fall down?

276
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,390
Get out.

277
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:26,610
It's not you, is it?

278
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:30,280
I've fought with you. I don't think you can kill anyone.

279
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,490
He was killed by Shanwu, right?

280
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,660
You're not going to catch Sanwu.

281
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,580
Why?

282
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:40,580
Because the memories of teenagers are too good

283
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,460
Instead of getting caught and then going to jail

284
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:46,420
He would choose to kill the police and then kill himself

285
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,050
He had suicidal impulses

286
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:07,150
Did I tell you not to be violent?

287
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:10,780
The police are hurt, the police.

288
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,160
I was the one who got hurt when I hit him

289
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,910
What are you doing with a gun?

290
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:18,830
I'm so out of breath I can't even run.

291
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:21,660
Also, you have to let the suspect speak for himself

292
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,460
Why did you say it all?

293
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,500
Are you listening too much to the suspects

294
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,090
So did the Song Rilai thing

295
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:30,880
The suspect should have been summoned long ago, and now the arrest warrant has come down.

296
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,390
The police officer who did the work, Michiko, brought in the surveillance video.

297
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:38,060
captured Song Seo-rae going in and out of his grandmother's house

298
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:46,690
The alibi became

299
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,150
Hey, Michie.

300
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:50,860
Did you say that there are many women in Hong San Wu?

301
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,400
Type out the list

302
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,450
Turnover time and special matters

303
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:57,330
Current addresses are traced and then appended to it

304
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,290
Such a beautiful woman

305
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:03,250
Why would you get married to an old man like that, living in Korea?

306
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:06,210
Just because she's young, beautiful and foreign.

307
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,840
So you have to be a suspect?

308
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,260
You do admit she's beautiful.

309
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,050
This is the difference in treatment

310
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,930
If the person is not a woman and not a foreigner

311
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:17,180
It's just a Korean man, the team leader.

312
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,640
You must have immediately said go lurk

313
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,480
Isn't that your interest in lurking?

314
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,600
And nagging

315
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,310
Damn

316
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,580
And don't put ice cream in the freezer

317
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,960
And sleep with the TV on in an uncomfortable position

318
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,090
Good morning

319
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,470
Good morning.

320
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:46,430
Why do you suddenly say morning greetings? I'm panicking, okay?

321
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,690
Because I slept well.

322
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,400
For sleeping well

323
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,530
You sent me crows again because I gave you food?

324
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,280
Forget it.

325
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:46,160
What if you have to want to give me a gift?

326
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,660
The detective.

327
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,460
Go get his heart and bring it to me.

328
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,540
I kind of want it

329
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,460
You sent me crows again because I gave you food?

330
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,920
Forget it.

331
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,930
You have to want to give me a gift.

332
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:05,100
The friendly detective, go and bring me his heart.

333
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,720
I kind of want it.

334
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,310
Ice cream for dinner again

335
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,730
No smoking after dinner

336
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:36,380
Finally...crying

337
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,600
In the morning...

338
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,480
What

339
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:04,240
Good morning to you

340
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,530
The accidental death of Jiuxiaoshan

341
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:09,030
You're still chasing after it?

342
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:15,170
Close the case quickly and take on a bigger case to move up the ladder.

343
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:18,380
It's a case like the Seven Lucky Caves.

344
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,630
The boy who makes people uncomfortable

345
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:56,620
I heard the case of Jiuxiaoshan is about to be closed.

346
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,420
What's this Chinese file?

347
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,000
Isn't the investigation still open?

348
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,670
There are no circumstances to suspect murder.

349
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:06,630
I now want to catch the murderer of the Seven Lucky Caves

350
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,930
Song Rilai is a murder suspect

351
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:11,720
Back in China, it's at least a life sentence

352
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,390
I've translated it and sent it to you

353
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,060
You see

354
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,190
You...

355
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:23,610
Met a few of Hongsanwu's girlfriends

356
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,530
See them all in two days and send a report up

357
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,860
Ah this ....

358
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,240
Hey

359
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:38,290
Look at that. She killed Mom.

360
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,760
What did she do outside in the cold?

361
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,340
It's a nice idea to have a foggy sea or something...

362
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:51,970
Going to Busan is the sea

363
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:53,720
To Iripo is also the sea

364
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,930
I'm the man of the sea

365
00:35:55,930 --> 00:36:01,110
I'm a man of the sea.

366
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,230
I want to smoke

367
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:09,660
I need to get rid of this idea before it's too late.

368
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,870
I'll go find the dried marmalade.

369
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:17,960
Aren't you chewing on that quit cigarette?

370
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,420
Martin Lee Lin

371
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,960
It's me

372
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,750
Do you have any dried marmalade there?

373
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:27,510
My husband wants to smoke again

374
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:31,340
I ran out of time to quit

375
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,510
(Song Rilai)
I don't know

376
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,290
(What do you think? Please come to my house)
Really

377
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:21,440
How can you holler at a cop?

378
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,360
Anyway, you're always here, aren't you?

379
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,860
They say you killed your mother.

380
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,490
Hoe Hill

381
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:40,620
It's the mountain of your grandfather's old home in Korea

382
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,500
Fuck your grandfather

383
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,340
Go there.

384
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:50,800
Go to your hoe hill

385
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,680
But

386
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,050
Kill me first

387
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:00,640
You know, I'm just trying to take care of you professionally.

388
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,850
I just became a nurse.

389
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,850
And you're always telling me

390
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:06,900
Just because I'm a nurse

391
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,110
Then let me kill you professionally

392
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:12,780
So I sent her off the way she expected me to.

393
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:16,070
Fentanyl capsules. Just four of them.

394
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,910
I got some for myself, too.

395
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:23,000
Where did you put it? Fentanyl.

396
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:31,460
If you're curious, open it.

397
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,520
Kido Show is suicide

398
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,030
Okay.

399
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:02,790
Kido Show staring at faces and stamping passports.

400
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,580
He's been doing this job for over 20 years.

401
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,080
expressionlessly

402
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,040
And without a friend

403
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,090
Why are you with that kind of man...

404
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:12,590
I was locked up in the bottom of the boat in a fish hold on a 3 volt day

405
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:15,050
10 days at sea

406
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:17,220
I look like a skeleton

407
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,050
Stained with shit and urine

408
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:21,220
The whole thing's a nervous wreck.

409
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,140
Swaying around

410
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:27,480
I was locked in the bottom of the boat in the fish hold on a three volt day

411
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,560
I was adrift at sea for ten days

412
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,400
I look like a skeleton

413
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,190
Stained with shit and urine

414
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:37,240
The whole thing just wobbles around nervously

415
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,070
He's seen what I look like

416
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:41,490
He's smelled me

417
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,410
He Heard My Story

418
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:44,790
He's seen my good looks

419
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,330
He has smelled me

420
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:49,290
He Heard My Story

421
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:51,710
Whose house do you stare at at night?

422
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,420
Does your wife know?

423
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,010
Whose house are you staring at at night?

424
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:59,550
Does your wife know?

425
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:03,510
I can't live with the stigma of being a corrupt civil servant

426
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,560
No matter what the cost

427
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,310
I will prove my innocence in the near future

428
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:09,980
Restoration of reputation

429
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,440
(Kido Show)

430
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,900
The police should have been notified

431
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,690
(sender)
402, Building 2, Daido Apt. 532-9, Nam Bumin-dong, West Busan
Kido-soo
Receiver
Busan Immigration Office, 88-12 Jungang-dong 2-ga, Jung-gu, Busan
Director of Examination Jung Young-joon

432
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,490
I'm very sorry.

433
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,870
Suicide

434
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:23,740
You are sure

435
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:24,990
Didn't you get a suicide note?

436
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:29,460
Brother, you're no different from other cops

437
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,960
The man who became the youngest police commissioner in history...

438
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,840
If he's no different than any other cop, I'm willing to dance.

439
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:47,680
Of course, the evidence that killed the mother is not the evidence that killed the husband.

440
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,650
But didn't you say something like that?

441
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:55,570
Killing is like smoking

442
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:58,690
It's only the beginning that's hard

443
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:07,450
Yes

444
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,370
Sorry

445
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,790
Hey, Su-wan.

446
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:16,460
Suwan, let's go.

447
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,470
Let's go, you little shit!

448
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:24,050
- Brother.
- Yeah, get up.

449
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,060
What's going on?

450
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,730
Let's go.

451
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,520
Our group leader

452
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,230
Looks a little wilted, but he's actually a pretty scary guy.

453
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,570
I'll get you next time.

454
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,400
Let's go. Let's go.

455
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,530
So when you kill your next husband, please also refer to

456
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:43,530
Hello?

457
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:44,320
Brother, take the bag.

458
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,280
It's okay. It's okay. Let's go.

459
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,330
Go, go, go.

460
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,490
- I've made it simple enough, haven't I?
- Let's go.

461
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,210
I went out of my way to come to Busan because I respect you.

462
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,670
No, no, no.

463
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:54,790
Just one question for you.

464
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:55,500
Don't ask

465
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,090
Why did you buy her a gun?

466
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,760
Brat

467
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,850
Foot

468
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,280
Case closed

469
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:25,200
You're no longer a suspect.

470
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,410
Happy?

471
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:29,200
What

472
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,910
What am I happy about?

473
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,250
Yes, I'm happy.

474
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,050
Why

475
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:42,420
What

476
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,680
Just think...

477
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,010
We'll never...

478
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:47,590
Never again what

479
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,220
what

480
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:07,860
Did you have dinner?

481
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:11,660
Ah, yes.

482
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:15,620
Ice cream

483
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:22,550
This is what I would do...the only...

484
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:24,460
Chinese Cuisine

485
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,810
I do all kinds of things in the evening

486
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,730
Because of insomnia

487
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:49,820
Ah, insomnia means bad sleep.

488
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,050
Those are the unsolved cases

489
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:09,510
I didn't know when to take it off, so I left it there.

490
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,930
An unsolved case... is a case that has not been solved.

491
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:17,980
Unsolved cases

492
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,730
Ants Eating People?

493
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:25,780
Ah, that.

494
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,900
First the flies will appear

495
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,030
It will arrive in ten minutes, no matter how early or late.

496
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:33,030
After eating blood and secretions

497
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:36,330
spawning in wounds and all the holes in the body

498
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:37,910
Maggots coming out of it

499
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:39,920
The ants will gather in order to eat the maggots

500
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,460
And then the beetles, the hornets.

501
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:46,090
Beginning to feed on humans

502
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:02,810
You call this Chinese?

503
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:07,610
But it tastes good.

504
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:12,320
So it's impossible to stop

505
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:17,910
Because the bleeding picture is wailing

506
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:21,500
The man was found in the mountains a month after his death

507
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,960
The hand axe that smashed his own head was next to him

508
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,250
Hong Shanwu

509
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:31,380
, , , and
It's the real culprit of the Seven Lucky Caves case, but I just can't find it.

510
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:35,180
I look at these photos whenever I can.

511
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,310
When visiting his ex-girlfriend

512
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:40,980
Now I feel that I've become very close to him

513
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:45,190
I've been in jail.

514
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:47,520
Yes. Only lived together for a month.

515
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:49,530
Misunderstood his woman's relationship with another man

516
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:51,360
Beat up the man

517
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,610
I'm more afraid of prison than death.

518
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:56,280
It's true.

519
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,620
- Anyone?
- This guy actually beat someone with the consciousness of being in jail

520
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:02,830
It's the woman he loves to death

521
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,010
Wu Jia Ren

522
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,240
He got away

523
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,950
Go after him!

524
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:37,910
brother

525
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,120
Already transferred the magazines

526
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:49,040
Wu Jia Ren lives far away

527
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,130
She opened a beauty salon in Gyeonggi-do

528
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:58,090
And got married

529
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,820
In Korea

530
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:16,910
Would you be happy if the person you like gets married?

531
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,290
Hey, Hong Sanwu

532
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,250
Hong Shanwu

533
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:09,710
You

534
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:12,090
It's not the money that killed Xiaohu, is it?

535
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,380
Right?

536
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:14,960
I've checked them all.

537
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,840
When you're in jail for a month

538
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,340
Xiao Hu touched Wu Jia Ren, didn't he?

539
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:34,020
To be honest, I have a woman I like too.

540
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:36,900
But her husband beats her

541
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,860
I'd like to kill that guy.

542
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:44,450
Why do those women always sleep with that crap?

543
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:45,660
Even though I'm trash too

544
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,660
So, yeah

545
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,420
How you're garbage now

546
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:56,630
You are true to the good people

547
00:48:56,630 --> 00:49:00,300
You've left everything for her

548
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,140
You...

549
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:17,690
Please tell the good people

550
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:24,120
Although I have suffered for you

551
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:32,000
but because of you, my life is not empty

552
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,420
Thank you.

553
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:42,550
Hong Sanwu, don't do this.

554
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:44,260
Hey

555
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,300
Looks like we don't need to bother you.

556
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:52,230
Are you okay?

557
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:54,770
Let people like that drive home right now.

558
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,730
What kind of company does that?

559
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:57,770
Do you want me to go to Busan?

560
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,070
No, no, there's no need to come.

561
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:01,900
And anyway, when you're depressed, I...

562
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,150
I'm not depressed.

563
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,110
Really?

564
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,910
I have to go to the bathroom.

565
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:06,950
Okay, you go.

566
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:08,620
I'm hanging up.

567
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,590
After persistently asking around, I finally found her.

568
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:23,260
And after killing her husband Jiang

569
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:28,180
It was confirmed that he and Wu had been living together

570
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:29,930
Which one is it?

571
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:33,810
Is that the wife?

572
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:36,730
I told you not to come...

573
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:39,650
What is it?

574
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:41,530
Because I want to put you to bed.

575
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:45,070
Do you think I'm an old man who lives alone?

576
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:47,570
To squeeze my arms and shoulders

577
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,830
What are you doing here?

578
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:55,420
Didn't you say you'd take it off after you solved it?

579
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:13,600
Ah, my husband's picture is going to be burned too

580
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:48,890
They say this is too dark

581
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:50,970
Even that's beautiful.

582
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,790
What did you say about me?

583
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:19,330
Try speaking Chinese.

584
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,640
Nice

585
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:36,930
Silhouette

586
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,770
Then let's leave this one

587
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,030
I'll keep this...this one too.

588
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,790
I'll take this one too.

589
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,380
This is better, isn't it?

590
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:18,810
Can I sleep well now?

591
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:20,600
Well

592
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,810
I have a method

593
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:26,690
The law?

594
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:31,700
I upgraded the one developed by the U.S. Navy

595
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,910
I'm from the Navy.

596
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:40,330
What did the U.S. Navy develop?

597
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:42,210
Eyes closed

598
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,470
Do you really want my heart?

599
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:53,630
Yes

600
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,600
What do you want with my heart?

601
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:03,230
I said heart not heart

602
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:06,440
Ah. ...

603
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,070
Come on.

604
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:17,280
Listen to the sound of my breathing

605
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,120
Align your breathing with my breathing

606
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:41,560
Now go to the sea go to the water

607
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:49,820
You're a jellyfish

608
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:54,200
Neither eyes nor nose

609
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,160
Neither mind

610
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:03,500
Neither joy nor sorrow

611
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:07,170
Without any emotion

612
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:10,000
One stroke at a time

613
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,710
Paddle out everything that happened today

614
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,090
Push it to me...

615
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:36,700
Korean women have soft hands, don't they?

616
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:40,660
Do nurses not use gloves much?

617
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:42,990
The calluses on the hands are...

618
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:49,170
Feeling good from the start

619
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:52,920
Because the cop in charge of me has class

620
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,010
Are you saying that being a cop is classy?

621
00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:00,600
As a Korean?

622
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,510
As a man?

623
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,310
As a modern man

624
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:15,780
So, Rileys, what era are you from?

625
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,490
Tang Dynasty?

626
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:22,490
Why don't you ask me why I like you, Rileys?

627
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:25,330
If you know, are you afraid of always thinking about it?

628
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:29,790
I already knew that you and I were of the same race, Rileys.

629
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:35,130
When I said I wanted to see my husband's picture

630
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:39,630
The words are saying no

631
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:47,270
I also always try to face up to

632
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:56,860
half of the corpses at the scene were open-eyed

633
00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:01,610
It must be agreed to catch the culprit whose eyes were last seen

634
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:11,330
What I'm afraid of is a scene with a lot of blood

635
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:13,170
Because of the smell

636
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:25,010
That's why you always carry a nice smelling hand cream, right?

637
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:31,690
Do you have anything else with you?

638
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:53,750
Rileys what are you afraid of?

639
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:55,960
Because it's a nurse so it can't be blood

640
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,880
High

641
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:03,340
Pocket ....

642
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:05,680
12 on jackets 6 on pants

643
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,430
It was made to order at the store I always go to

644
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:09,930
Because I've helped them with cases, so they give me a discount

645
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:13,640
Because I had to go directly to the case, I would wear this on my day off.

646
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:16,980
Even if it's a day off, it's not like you can't kill someone, right?

647
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,230
Don't get me wrong, I don't always wear the same clothes.

648
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:20,780
I have a lot of them. What about me?

649
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,830
It's clean.

650
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:32,160
Turning books and notebooks neatly side by side

651
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,960
No matter how many hours it is, writing all the time.

652
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:39,920
Even though I'm transcribing, I'm always looking at my phone.

653
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,470
Or maybe I'm looking at a dictionary translation

654
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:45,010
Watching serials again

655
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:47,220
Talking to myself while watching

656
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:51,350
Is it because you learned it from watching costume dramas that you speak in an old-fashioned way?

657
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:53,980
Ice cream for dinner again

658
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:56,520
It's not okay to smoke after a meal

659
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:59,730
So you're crying. Finally...

660
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,700
bad luck

661
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:08,200
I know that's a swear word.

662
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,830
In front of the Buddha, it's really...

663
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:25,550
You'll delete the document after you solve the case, right?

664
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:27,220
Yes

665
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:45,530
It was the day Mom left, wasn't it?

666
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,870
If you remember the number of the case in question

667
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:52,280
There are many times when it would be helpful to investigate

668
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:59,960
Because the case is closed

669
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,460
So I would forget the case number

670
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:40,620
Only the streets filled with fog

671
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:43,130
How do you know this old song

672
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:45,500
Everyone who lives in this neighborhood knows it

673
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:47,510
It's the theme song here

674
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:49,930
twin flames also sang it

675
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:51,640
Yeah?

676
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:01,480
You're smoking.

677
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:04,190
Must have smoked

678
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:07,190
Cigarette

679
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:09,860
Su-wan, you really

680
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:10,990
It's too much of a fuss

681
01:01:10,990 --> 01:01:13,320
It's like I have a lung disease

682
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:47,940
If you go 250 miles east, there's an oil and water peak.

683
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:50,900
The peak of this mountain is hidden in the depths

684
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,320
Only those who reach the top can see it

685
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,950
A man's hand really

686
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:59,700
Softer than a young girl's hand

687
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:05,500
I have calluses on my hands

688
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:08,960
Recently it was like this

689
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:13,090
Originally the palm of the hand looked like lips

690
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:19,260
SIRI Play a song for me

691
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:22,890
Who's that? Who's singing that?

692
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:26,890
My phone has been acting up lately

693
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:30,440
It's the same phone as Riley's

694
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:33,070
Of course, after all, it was bought at the same time

695
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:36,280
(Mailbox)
Shouldn't open too many apps

696
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:56,460
This Monday, Rileys came to your house, right?

697
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:59,220
If it was Monday, of course she would have come.

698
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:01,340
Looks like you two went somewhere

699
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:05,680
For more than a decade I've been shut up

700
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:09,940
Grandma, what day of the week is it?

701
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:19,950
Where's the grandmother you're talking about, brother?

702
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:24,320
I don't really understand weeks

703
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:32,370
Haidong you're really smart

704
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:35,340
Suppose

705
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:39,260
Riley, if you come here today

706
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:41,510
Then it's Monday

707
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:56,900
(Morning Afternoon)
After setting the time to the time when Song Rilai was captured by the entrance/exit surveillance

708
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:58,690
Departure

709
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:17,420
It takes about 7 minutes to steal a cell phone and leave.

710
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:23,590
If you sneak out the back window

711
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:25,510
It's an unsupervised dead end

712
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:31,270
There are two routes

713
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:34,140
(West Zone 3 Country Bus)

714
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:36,810
But it takes about the same amount of time to reach the top

715
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:39,570
Although I've been climbing the difficult route

716
01:06:39,570 --> 01:06:41,900
But today, to take care of my newbie friends

717
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:44,610
So it's time to climb from the easy route

718
01:06:44,610 --> 01:06:47,950
Song Rilai must have chosen the easy route

719
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:49,740
Because you can't be seen by your husband

720
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:52,870
Okay, room manager, I'm just in time for work.

721
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:56,630
Okay, I'll be fine. Bye.

722
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:07,430
9:00 Confirmation call from Aged Care Services

723
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:11,430
There's no need to feel ashamed after slipping in a place like this

724
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:14,730
Asuka Peak was originally known as Oil and Water Peak

725
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:19,570
It's as smooth as oil, so it was called Oil and Water Peak.

726
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:38,250
Isn't it a lovely view?

727
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:40,420
If you start listening to Mahler's Fifth Symphony

728
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:43,300
will arrive at the end of the fourth movement

729
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:47,090
Sitting at the top, listening to the fifth movement and going down the mountain

730
01:07:47,090 --> 01:07:49,340
Then it's perfect

731
01:07:49,350 --> 01:07:52,510
The perfect way to kill someone

732
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:55,980
Song Rilai must be hiding here, and then he's on top.

733
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:59,560
Before the end of the fifth movement of Mahler's Fifth Symphony

734
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:31,720
The final line of the fifth movement will encounter some difficulties

735
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:34,220
Anyway, you will know after experiencing it first hand

736
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:40,600
If you compare it with the difficult route I climbed

737
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:42,860
This is a piece of cake

738
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:46,400
It's like eating sushi with a dip

739
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:50,280
If you hold a ladder and climb up

740
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:54,450
I don't know when my body has already reached the top

741
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:35,410
Korean women have soft hands

742
01:09:45,090 --> 01:09:46,800
10:00 am

743
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:52,260
I am currently at the summit of my favorite mountain, Jushao Hidaka

744
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:16,410
The dirty world is far apart

745
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:19,620
It doesn't matter if I die like this

746
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:02,330
Aren't you afraid of heights?

747
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:05,460
Why was he hit

748
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:09,000
Branded by him on his body like a domestic animal

749
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,380
And not calling the police

750
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:15,510
Why don't you trust the police

751
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:22,220
He said he would deport me back to China

752
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:26,230
So sending threatening letters to your husband

753
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:32,150
That letter wouldn't be surprising no matter when it was sent

754
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:36,110
Because the contents are true

755
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:44,830
You wrote the letter that Kido-soo sent to the immigration office.

756
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:48,540
But the address and name on the envelope are in his own handwriting

757
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:50,500
How did you do it?

758
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:22,990
I just changed the defense that my husband wrote

759
01:12:22,990 --> 01:12:26,460
Changed it to look like a suicide note

760
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:31,290
It's not really true that Xiu was violent to you?

761
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:36,420
Police officer goes to woman's house after drinking

762
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:38,970
Isn't it violent?

763
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:44,310
Burning photos

764
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:46,850
Delete all my recording files

765
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:48,810
Isn't it easy

766
01:12:48,810 --> 01:12:52,650
Just pretend to like me

767
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:55,280
I'll take care of everything for you

768
01:13:03,910 --> 01:13:07,750
Don't talk about us like that

769
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:10,250
We both

770
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:12,420
What's up with both of us

771
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:21,180
about me wandering outside your house every night and not returning?

772
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:26,310
The sound of your breathing and sleeping peacefully

773
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:30,020
Holding you and whispering happiness in your ear

774
01:13:46,990 --> 01:13:51,040
You said I was classy

775
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:54,920
Do you know where I get my airs from?

776
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:57,710
From confidence

777
01:13:57,710 --> 01:14:01,050
I was a very confident cop

778
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:02,760
But

779
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:06,810
but addicted to beauty

780
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:13,400
Delaying Investigation

781
01:14:15,690 --> 01:14:17,570
me

782
01:14:21,570 --> 01:14:24,110
Completely collapsed

783
01:14:31,370 --> 01:14:34,120
I replaced my grandmother's phone

784
01:14:34,130 --> 01:14:36,500
Replaced with same model

785
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:38,590
She didn't notice at all

786
01:14:41,670 --> 01:14:44,260
Let's throw that phone into the sea

787
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:52,140
Throw it in the deep sea. Don't let anyone find it.

788
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:03,630
Not catching criminals and other stress factors

789
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:05,760
(after 13 months)
Manifesting insomnia

790
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:08,640
What you can do now is

791
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:12,310
Take a sunbath half an hour before lunch

792
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:15,980
You can leave your clothes on, but you must keep your eyes open.

793
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:18,140
Doctor

794
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:21,310
You just opened in Iripo, right?

795
01:16:23,690 --> 01:16:27,400
There's no sun here in the morning because it's foggy.

796
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,040
There's hot water at home, right?

797
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:35,620
Yes

798
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:37,790
Take a footbath before going to bed

799
01:16:37,790 --> 01:16:39,920
I'll prescribe dopamine for you

800
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:40,710
You can take it.

801
01:16:40,710 --> 01:16:43,210
If it doesn't work

802
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:49,930
I have the device here to help breathe through the nose while sleeping

803
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:53,890
This

804
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:58,480
I heard that pomegranate has the effect of delaying amenorrhea

805
01:17:00,270 --> 01:17:02,770
It's not more comforting not to do

806
01:17:02,770 --> 01:17:05,940
Having said that, however

807
01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:08,950
I've been eating at home every day since you got back.

808
01:17:08,950 --> 01:17:12,120
And eating these pomegranates feels so much healthier

809
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:14,200
Why are you getting wilted?

810
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,950
What do you mean by "wilting"?

811
01:17:15,950 --> 01:17:17,370
You think I'm a pomegranate?

812
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:20,250
Director Li was shocked to see your picture

813
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:23,040
Said so handsome how to become this look

814
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:27,010
56% of middle-aged men are at risk for depression

815
01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:30,470
I heard that a man known to Director Li drank turtle essence with particularly good results

816
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:32,430
Testosterone Surge

817
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:57,160
I'm really happy that you're back in Iripo

818
01:17:57,160 --> 01:18:00,620
I'm also very happy

819
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:04,830
You're only happy when you're in the company of murder and violence

820
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:16,220
Where's your husband?

821
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:18,680
Leaving me behind and running away

822
01:18:20,310 --> 01:18:22,060
Bastard

823
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:26,940
What's all this

824
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:32,570
If it weren't for your husband, how else would you buy these

825
01:18:32,570 --> 01:18:35,910
You guys fucking buy and buy and buy and buy and live in style

826
01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:38,790
My mom cries and begs me every day

827
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:41,580
My mother has long since recovered from her surgery

828
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:47,130
What Doctors Say

829
01:18:47,130 --> 01:18:49,670
He said he won't last a month

830
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:54,380
If my mom leaves

831
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:56,640
Your son of a bitch husband

832
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:09,650
I told you, I'll put up with you for 10 minutes.

833
01:19:09,650 --> 01:19:12,280
For your mother's sake

834
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:16,160
Does your mom know you're out beating up women?

835
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:18,700
Does your mother know what they call you outside?

836
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:25,330
If my mom leaves

837
01:19:25,330 --> 01:19:28,630
Put it in the freezer for now

838
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:30,300
Wait for me to kill your husband

839
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:32,880
And then bury my mother

840
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:40,430
I had a hard time raising her

841
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:42,020
Don't worry

842
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:43,140
Our team leader

843
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:45,230
But the youngest person to be awarded the position of police commissioner in our country

844
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:47,520
He's the most powerful man in Kukohama

845
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,060
Team leader

846
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:52,570
The stolen items are 58 turtles

847
01:19:52,570 --> 01:19:54,400
Approximate amount of damage

848
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,240
Market value of 3 million won or more

849
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:59,410
Oh my god, how can it be so expensive?

850
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:02,870
I heard it works wonders for middle-aged men with depression

851
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:05,160
Not bad for being the youngest person to become a police commissioner

852
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:07,620
You even know this kind of thing?

853
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:09,130
Go out and tell them to turn off the lights

854
01:20:09,130 --> 01:20:10,960
Yes

855
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:12,550
Hey, Dauh

856
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:16,670
You're so stupid.

857
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:22,060
I told you to stay away.

858
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:28,020
The way to see you

859
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:31,360
- This is the only one. What do you want me to do?
- What do you want me to do?

860
01:20:36,150 --> 01:20:39,240
Honey, we have to pack our bags now.

861
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,410
You've changed your number again.

862
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:44,290
Be quick, Ironstone has found out where you are.

863
01:20:44,290 --> 01:20:47,120
And next week you can help me with the Chinese.

864
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,540
Can't get through to China

865
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:50,420
I'm really passive

866
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:52,630
A message came through

867
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,050
I've been looking for you.

868
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:59,760
Looks like we can't see anyone for a while

869
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,050
I love you

870
01:21:01,050 --> 01:21:02,890
Are we okay with each other?

871
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:05,350
Don't mention that yet

872
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:06,560
Let's move first

873
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,650
Yes, we have to move. Ironstone found it there.

874
01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:12,480
Where do you want to move to

875
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:37,380
Fire Alarm Real Fire Alarm or Drill

876
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:40,550
If this is a fake fire, no one will come out next time.

877
01:21:53,610 --> 01:21:56,770
People say you're here because you're depressed

878
01:21:56,780 --> 01:22:00,610
For failing to stop a criminal from killing himself

879
01:22:00,610 --> 01:22:04,120
But now it's healed

880
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:06,780
Do you think I'm still depressed?

881
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:12,500
That's because of insomnia. Insomnia.

882
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,880
Wearing leather shoes now

883
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,630
If you don't smoke, why don't you go in?

884
01:22:17,630 --> 01:22:20,130
Did you see me alone and come to keep me company?

885
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:26,890
It's really quiet in a remote mountain village

886
01:22:26,890 --> 01:22:29,890
If you want to smoke, go out and smoke

887
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:36,730
I love you

888
01:23:08,510 --> 01:23:09,220
Why are you here?

889
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:10,600
I haven't moved here long.

890
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:12,100
Why

891
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:16,770
Nothing to see here again

892
01:23:16,770 --> 01:23:19,730
I like the fog

893
01:23:19,730 --> 01:23:21,820
My name is Song Rilai

894
01:23:21,820 --> 01:23:25,030
I'm Chinese and I don't speak Korean well

895
01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:30,700
Honey, this is a detective.

896
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:32,250
Once Suspected Me

897
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:36,670
Ah, I am her successor husband

898
01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:38,460
My name is Lim Ho Shin

899
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:42,460
My name is Zhang Haijun

900
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:44,550
How did you come to Iripo?

901
01:23:53,390 --> 01:23:56,060
I just touched the sea fish

902
01:23:59,060 --> 01:24:01,730
What brings you to Iripo?

903
01:24:01,730 --> 01:24:03,360
I moved too

904
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,530
My wife works here

905
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:11,700
My name is Quiet Ann

906
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:17,170
I've only heard of leaving because of the fog, but never because of the fog

907
01:24:17,170 --> 01:24:20,920
Wait until you see how bad the mold is here

908
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:25,380
Honey, you're really

909
01:24:30,430 --> 01:24:33,600
We're here because of the nuclear power plant

910
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:34,680
What

911
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:35,770
why

912
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:38,310
- Red Alert
- Hmmm

913
01:24:38,310 --> 01:24:41,650
A drama in which Woo-bin appeared to solve the nuclear leakage accident

914
01:24:41,650 --> 01:24:46,070
Chinese women are crazy to come just to see the filming location

915
01:24:46,070 --> 01:24:49,160
Isn't she a tour guide?

916
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:51,320
Since you are making money with that selling point

917
01:24:51,330 --> 01:24:54,040
I shouldn't have said

918
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:57,000
A TV show that sells itself on the basis of a nuclear crisis with no basis in fact

919
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Really gives us a headache

920
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,080
She works at a nuclear power plant

921
01:25:02,090 --> 01:25:05,050
Sensitive to such issues

922
01:25:05,050 --> 01:25:08,840
Actually nuclear power is very safe

923
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:18,680
Have you been on a stock market show

924
01:25:18,690 --> 01:25:20,650
Did you see that?

925
01:25:20,650 --> 01:25:22,810
I'm a stock market analyst

926
01:25:22,810 --> 01:25:25,730
Not an anal anal analyst who likes anal

927
01:25:35,290 --> 01:25:38,330
You're younger in person than the TV picture

928
01:25:40,670 --> 01:25:43,630
Morning swimming is the secret to my youthful appearance

929
01:25:43,630 --> 01:25:47,840
You can call me anytime if you want to know the secret of investment

930
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,050
Please give me a business card too

931
01:25:49,050 --> 01:25:50,760
Your business card is gorgeous...

932
01:26:10,450 --> 01:26:12,780
No need to run here

933
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:34,470
She's beautiful.

934
01:26:34,470 --> 01:26:38,100
Yeah, the green dress is pretty.

935
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:40,310
Isn't it blue?

936
01:26:40,310 --> 01:26:42,810
Whatever the color

937
01:26:42,810 --> 01:26:46,610
Chinese Woman Widowed and Becoming a Widow

938
01:26:46,610 --> 01:26:49,230
Did I hear about that case?

939
01:26:51,490 --> 01:26:53,200
I remember hearing about the suicide of a Chinese daughter-in-law because

940
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:58,240
The case of becoming a widower

941
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:00,660
There was a case like that

942
01:27:00,660 --> 01:27:03,370
The husband at the end was the culprit, right?

943
01:27:03,370 --> 01:27:04,670
No

944
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:07,290
I suspect the wrong person

945
01:27:07,290 --> 01:27:10,050
Didn't you suspect that woman too?

946
01:27:10,050 --> 01:27:14,260
Yeah, and it turns out that her husband died by suicide.

947
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:17,390
Why do you always suspect the wrong person?

948
01:27:17,390 --> 01:27:21,430
So people don't like us

949
01:27:21,430 --> 01:27:23,230
We

950
01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:26,020
Police

951
01:27:49,170 --> 01:27:52,050
(Detective Lu Yeon Soo)

952
01:27:54,510 --> 01:27:56,090
There's blood in my hands.

953
01:27:57,590 --> 01:27:59,260
Hello

954
01:28:02,430 --> 01:28:04,930
Hubby

955
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:06,690
Congratulations

956
01:28:08,610 --> 01:28:10,560
It's a homicide.

957
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:18,700
Presumed time of death is 11:00

958
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:22,580
Stabbed 17 times

959
01:28:22,580 --> 01:28:25,500
Stabbed 13 times in stomach and chest

960
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:27,160
4 on back

961
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:30,460
The back was stabbed while running away, right?

962
01:28:30,460 --> 01:28:34,130
You've been stabbed 13 times and you can still run away?

963
01:28:34,130 --> 01:28:38,340
Why is the body in that position?

964
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:42,760
There is a first finder group leader want to find him over

965
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:24,680
The prisoner is left-handed

966
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:29,060
Mark up

967
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:50,870
That's why you came to Iripo

968
01:29:50,870 --> 01:29:53,210
You think I'm a bully?

969
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:58,460
Am I that bad?

970
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:13,150
Song Rilai you listen up

971
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:15,980
This time the alibi

972
01:30:15,980 --> 01:30:18,690
Must be as indestructible as a pebble

973
01:30:23,110 --> 01:30:25,160
Do you think his wife is the murderer?

974
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:26,410
Why

975
01:30:26,410 --> 01:30:30,040
Because there are no traces of intrusions, stolen items or bundles?

976
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:32,460
Because of sudden frontal stabbing

977
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:35,830
Think this is a revenge killing?

978
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:39,300
Or his wife wasn't surprised and sad

979
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:43,550
It varies from person to person. Some people grieve like a wave...

980
01:30:43,550 --> 01:30:45,800
Why do you always ask me questions

981
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:48,060
How come I don't see you talking to other people like that?

982
01:30:52,270 --> 01:30:55,850
I met her in Busan last year for a case

983
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:57,900
It was also because her husband had died

984
01:30:57,900 --> 01:30:59,900
Did she kill him?

985
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:05,280
Suddenly the question of whether she could be the killer came to mind

986
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:07,030
That case was classified as a suicide

987
01:31:07,030 --> 01:31:10,410
but the husband died here again, and in my jurisdiction.

988
01:31:10,410 --> 01:31:12,830
She's right-handed

989
01:31:12,830 --> 01:31:17,080
So think about it. Why is she the killer?

990
01:31:21,510 --> 01:31:23,970
They want me to go to the police station

991
01:31:23,970 --> 01:31:26,800
Can I get my handbag?

992
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:31,520
You've gone for a walk

993
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:34,180
And I don't have my cell phone so I can't confirm my route

994
01:31:34,190 --> 01:31:36,520
The alibi is not easy to confirm

995
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:39,610
Yes

996
01:31:39,610 --> 01:31:43,070
Why aren't you worried about

997
01:31:43,070 --> 01:31:46,860
Did your husband have any enemies with anyone

998
01:31:46,870 --> 01:31:50,030
I heard that a lot of money was raised and invested

999
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:53,040
Recently lost a lot of money

1000
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:56,290
Losing money and living in a fancy apartment

1001
01:31:56,290 --> 01:32:00,000
Spend money to show others to earn money

1002
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:07,630
Why marry that kind of man

1003
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:15,020
I married a man to make up my mind to break up with him

1004
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:24,820
What did you come to Iripo for?

1005
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:27,740
I didn't come here for any reason

1006
01:32:27,740 --> 01:32:31,490
If there is, the debtor will follow

1007
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:45,380
Choosing a husband not out of love

1008
01:32:45,380 --> 01:32:48,630
That husband was bullying everywhere

1009
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:50,640
and then died

1010
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:52,390
Exactly the same as last year

1011
01:32:52,390 --> 01:32:54,810
What

1012
01:32:54,810 --> 01:32:59,850
That husband committed suicide

1013
01:33:02,730 --> 01:33:04,440
Okay then

1014
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:08,150
Your two husbands

1015
01:33:08,150 --> 01:33:11,160
In the same place of jurisdiction of the criminal police

1016
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:14,160
And in a place of jurisdiction far away from each other

1017
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:17,700
One killed himself and one was killed

1018
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:19,620
If others hear about this kind of thing

1019
01:33:19,620 --> 01:33:21,670
I'm sure he thinks so

1020
01:33:22,790 --> 01:33:25,130
Really good coincidence

1021
01:33:26,630 --> 01:33:29,340
What would you say if you were Song Rilai?

1022
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:38,230
She's really pathetic

1023
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:26,900
The dress is not this one. It's a blue dress.

1024
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:28,530
No jacket

1025
01:34:28,530 --> 01:34:30,190
Is it blue?

1026
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:31,820
Not green

1027
01:34:31,820 --> 01:34:33,660
Thank you

1028
01:34:37,490 --> 01:34:39,790
It's blue.

1029
01:34:39,790 --> 01:34:41,910
What she was doing

1030
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:54,800
really

1031
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:58,220
Why did you move to this neighborhood?

1032
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:00,640
Why do you keep asking

1033
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:04,600
Does it matter to you why I'm here?

1034
01:35:09,190 --> 01:35:11,740
What's so important about that?

1035
01:35:15,570 --> 01:35:18,080
There's only one way to see you

1036
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,830
What can you make me do

1037
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:30,170
What did you wear while walking on the Sea Maid Pier

1038
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:33,420
This one

1039
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:35,180
You're lying.

1040
01:35:35,180 --> 01:35:37,140
Where did that lime green dress go?

1041
01:35:37,140 --> 01:35:39,890
Sometimes it looks like blue and sometimes it looks like green

1042
01:35:39,890 --> 01:35:41,970
with shiny buttons

1043
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:44,140
You're really looking closely.

1044
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:49,980
I'll turn it upside down

1045
01:35:55,570 --> 01:35:58,240
Oops sorry sorry sorry

1046
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:01,160
You're here

1047
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:03,410
Did you see it?

1048
01:36:03,410 --> 01:36:06,370
Wow, we can still have homicides around here.

1049
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:12,880
I'm sleepy right now. What are we going to do at night?

1050
01:36:33,070 --> 01:36:35,150
I came back from my walk the other day

1051
01:36:35,150 --> 01:36:37,900
The smell of blood is disgusting

1052
01:36:40,030 --> 01:36:42,780
I thought of you

1053
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,330
You're definitely coming to see these

1054
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:52,880
You're definitely going to feel scared

1055
01:37:34,670 --> 01:37:36,510
Song Rilai

1056
01:37:36,510 --> 01:37:42,300
You just admitted that you obliterated important evidence in the murder case

1057
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:43,970
As a suspect in the murder of Lim Ho Shin

1058
01:37:43,970 --> 01:37:45,850
I'm now placing you under emergency arrest

1059
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:53,230
I don't like cops following my husband

1060
01:37:55,150 --> 01:37:57,820
Let's have this smartwatch in our hands

1061
01:37:57,820 --> 01:37:59,610
Pulling out the audio file inside

1062
01:37:59,610 --> 01:38:01,410
It should be recorded in Chinese

1063
01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:03,870
- Get someone to translate

1064
01:38:06,450 --> 01:38:10,830
- Are you a man?
- No

1065
01:38:10,830 --> 01:38:14,170
Have you ever killed anyone?

1066
01:38:14,170 --> 01:38:16,960
Killed

1067
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:21,340
Did you kill your husband Lim Ho Shin?

1068
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:28,680
No

1069
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:53,580
group leader

1070
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:57,790
What are you doing here?

1071
01:39:10,390 --> 01:39:12,680
This is the recording file from the smartwatch

1072
01:39:12,690 --> 01:39:15,770
License plate numbers around the resort before and after the crime

1073
01:39:15,770 --> 01:39:18,150
Didn't we all go to confirm it?

1074
01:39:18,150 --> 01:39:21,490
There are victims of fraud by Lin Haoxin in there

1075
01:39:21,490 --> 01:39:23,650
It's the head of a violent organization

1076
01:39:23,650 --> 01:39:26,110
His name is Shi Tiecheng

1077
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:28,370
Is there anyone else with the name Shi?

1078
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:33,910
Bear with me.

1079
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:35,670
Let go of me

1080
01:39:38,540 --> 01:39:41,510
Is everything okay? What are you doing? You

1081
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:45,760
Call me

1082
01:39:47,090 --> 01:39:49,930
Call me

1083
01:39:49,930 --> 01:39:51,770
Mom

1084
01:39:53,940 --> 01:39:56,270
He's left-handed

1085
01:39:57,610 --> 01:39:59,690
270 million won

1086
01:39:59,690 --> 01:40:01,650
That was my mom's roadside stand for 10 years

1087
01:40:01,650 --> 01:40:03,240
It was so hard to open a Chinese restaurant

1088
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:06,490
18 hours a day to earn the money

1089
01:40:06,490 --> 01:40:08,660
I entrusted all that money to Lin Hao Xin

1090
01:40:08,660 --> 01:40:10,910
At first, I only put 10 million won

1091
01:40:10,910 --> 01:40:12,540
But the money was distributed on time

1092
01:40:12,540 --> 01:40:13,750
When I'm happy

1093
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:16,290
I put my entire fortune into it

1094
01:40:16,290 --> 01:40:18,710
And then he took a lot of people's money

1095
01:40:18,710 --> 01:40:20,960
To and from major hotels across the country

1096
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:24,590
Just gambling, buying bags and clothes for his wife

1097
01:40:24,590 --> 01:40:27,880
He's a money spinner, that son of a bitch.

1098
01:40:27,890 --> 01:40:30,850
That's 10 billion won

1099
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:33,470
My mother had severe diabetes

1100
01:40:33,470 --> 01:40:36,560
But she had a nervous breakdown when she found out the money had been cheated

1101
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:39,060
The kidney suffered another complication

1102
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:40,860
For failing to receive proper treatment

1103
01:40:40,860 --> 01:40:43,780
That's why ten toes were amputated

1104
01:40:43,780 --> 01:40:46,820
Do you know why my nickname is Ironstone?

1105
01:40:46,820 --> 01:40:48,950
Because I'm good at slapping people in the face with this iron slap

1106
01:40:48,950 --> 01:40:50,490
That's why I'm called Ironstone

1107
01:40:50,490 --> 01:40:53,990
It's lighter to hit someone with the palm of your hand than with your fist

1108
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,620
So it can keep hitting

1109
01:40:56,620 --> 01:40:58,160
But then I

1110
01:40:58,170 --> 01:40:59,920
I can't even kill Lin Haoxin

1111
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,380
Is that still a person?

1112
01:41:01,380 --> 01:41:03,880
Do you know Song Rilai?

1113
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:06,800
Didn't Sorelle ask you to kill him?

1114
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:09,050
Ha, I'm so...

1115
01:41:09,050 --> 01:41:13,850
I'm not the kind of person who can just tell anyone what to do.

1116
01:41:13,850 --> 01:41:16,220
Song Rilai is really helpful to me

1117
01:41:16,230 --> 01:41:18,140
She'll never know

1118
01:41:18,140 --> 01:41:22,810
Why is it that no matter how much you run, you can't escape me?

1119
01:41:26,610 --> 01:41:33,830
I've installed a locator app in this phone

1120
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:42,130
Wow, what is this?

1121
01:41:42,130 --> 01:41:44,000
Why did this hold up

1122
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,960
How scary!

1123
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:48,760
Hey, you son of a bitch.

1124
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:51,470
Want to get a good slap on the wrist today?

1125
01:41:51,470 --> 01:41:53,430
Are you crazy?

1126
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,060
Slap you

1127
01:42:00,390 --> 01:42:03,730
Team leader are you not happy?

1128
01:42:03,730 --> 01:42:05,520
Why should I be happy?

1129
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:08,990
We solved the first murder case in Irakura, didn't we?

1130
01:42:08,990 --> 01:42:11,530
Where is the best place to have dinner?

1131
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:15,080
Broken Who said it was broken?

1132
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:18,700
Since the culprit has shown up, Song Rilai should be able to be released home

1133
01:42:18,700 --> 01:42:20,960
I think so

1134
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:22,790
Greenstone wall three fork road towards the country clubhouse

1135
01:42:22,790 --> 01:42:24,920
Turtle thief fleeing on a motorcycle

1136
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:28,590
Greenstone wall three way street, direction of village hall

1137
01:42:41,770 --> 01:42:44,600
Hey, hey, let you run again!

1138
01:42:44,610 --> 01:42:46,560
Catch! Catch!

1139
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:51,240
Come on, come on.

1140
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:55,030
Get up! Get him back! Get him back!

1141
01:42:55,030 --> 01:42:56,780
Catch the big one first

1142
01:42:56,780 --> 01:43:00,160
They're mean. Watch your fingers.

1143
01:43:16,890 --> 01:43:19,510
For helping people recover stolen things

1144
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:25,940
My Husband and the Husband of a Woman I Know

1145
01:43:25,940 --> 01:43:27,940
Unreachable phone calls in the middle of the night

1146
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:31,780
Even called twice

1147
01:43:31,780 --> 01:43:33,780
Is it because of a typo?

1148
01:43:34,780 --> 01:43:39,580
To a married woman you're meeting for the first time?

1149
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:42,580
Although this could have gone away

1150
01:43:42,580 --> 01:43:46,460
If the man had been killed a few days later

1151
01:43:46,460 --> 01:43:48,130
wife

1152
01:43:54,930 --> 01:43:57,300
Did you kill him?

1153
01:44:04,940 --> 01:44:07,270
Did you two work together to kill it?

1154
01:44:08,860 --> 01:44:12,070
Is your finger okay?

1155
01:44:12,070 --> 01:44:14,240
This is the number of Lim Ho Shin's illegal cell phone

1156
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:16,650
Trace his location before he died

1157
01:44:16,660 --> 01:44:18,160
OK

1158
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:26,370
- Group leader
- Hmm

1159
01:44:31,380 --> 01:44:33,250
When the master is already dead at home

1160
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:37,720
Why does his phone turn on and off here

1161
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:41,260
Raise your arms a little bit higher and raise your hands a little bit higher.

1162
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:44,180
Oops, my arm hurts!

1163
01:44:47,020 --> 01:44:48,600
Stop

1164
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:56,280
Phone found. Get a diver to start searching here.

1165
01:44:56,280 --> 01:44:57,780
Is it deep there?

1166
01:44:57,780 --> 01:44:59,660
Wake up!

1167
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:01,450
We've got the culprit.

1168
01:45:01,450 --> 01:45:03,870
There is evidence and a confession has been made.

1169
01:45:03,870 --> 01:45:06,830
Please stop obsessing over that woman.

1170
01:45:06,830 --> 01:45:09,210
Don't you even feel sorry for her?

1171
01:45:27,100 --> 01:45:29,310
Wearing leather shoes

1172
01:45:29,310 --> 01:45:30,400
Growing a beard!

1173
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:33,020
The man who used to shave every morning and night

1174
01:45:33,020 --> 01:45:34,770
Became lazy

1175
01:45:34,780 --> 01:45:36,400
Why are you so lethargic?

1176
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:38,650
(Why are you so listless... You haven't seen me for too long? (laughs))
Ah, I haven't seen you for a long time. I miss you.

1177
01:45:38,650 --> 01:45:40,410
Yeah.

1178
01:45:47,710 --> 01:45:50,500
When he made that weird Chinese food

1179
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:53,250
I was smoking next to him the whole time

1180
01:45:53,250 --> 01:45:55,420
I can't even stand the smell of smoke

1181
01:45:55,420 --> 01:45:59,170
What's all this talk about love love love?

1182
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:05,560
I remember those nights when he was outside spying on me

1183
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:09,850
Feeling like a reliable man

1184
01:46:09,850 --> 01:46:13,730
Always there to watch over me, not even sleeping

1185
01:46:13,730 --> 01:46:15,650
(He's coming)
He's here.

1186
01:46:15,650 --> 01:46:19,940
(He must have asked me as soon as he came if I came to Iribo for doing this, what should I do?)
I'm sure he'll ask me if that's why I came to Iripo as soon as he arrives

1187
01:46:19,950 --> 01:46:23,570
What should I do?

1188
01:46:23,570 --> 01:46:24,910
What are you crying about?

1189
01:46:24,910 --> 01:46:27,370
Song Rilai

1190
01:46:29,460 --> 01:46:32,120
Should I tell him the answer?

1191
01:46:33,250 --> 01:46:35,210
Forget it

1192
01:46:36,130 --> 01:46:38,670
Maybe he

1193
01:46:38,670 --> 01:46:41,630
Already know. Maybe he

1194
01:46:41,630 --> 01:46:44,260
wouldn't even ask me

1195
01:46:48,270 --> 01:46:50,600
Is that why you came to Ipool?

1196
01:46:59,610 --> 01:47:01,440
Hello

1197
01:47:01,450 --> 01:47:04,410
What's in that phone? Answer me.

1198
01:47:06,410 --> 01:47:08,830
Open the door now!

1199
01:47:08,830 --> 01:47:10,540
I'm not there yet

1200
01:47:10,540 --> 01:47:12,250
Then where are you?

1201
01:47:12,250 --> 01:47:14,460
Hoe Hill

1202
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:16,000
What's in Lin Haoxin's phone

1203
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,090
Can make you throw it into the sea

1204
01:47:18,090 --> 01:47:21,880
Don't be sleepy. Hold on a little longer.

1205
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:25,800
No fog here

1206
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:28,970
Why did Lin Haoxin call my wife

1207
01:47:31,390 --> 01:47:35,690
Like the mother of the mountain often said so

1208
01:47:35,690 --> 01:47:38,400
Whenever I'm sad

1209
01:47:39,820 --> 01:47:43,700
Going to Korea will have this mountain

1210
01:47:46,990 --> 01:47:48,570
You tell me honestly

1211
01:47:48,580 --> 01:47:51,120
Lin Haoxin's intention to call Jing'an

1212
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:53,370
Seo-rae you know too, right?

1213
01:47:53,370 --> 01:47:56,670
Although it was taken away by the state in the verdict

1214
01:47:56,670 --> 01:48:02,050
But no matter what people say in my heart Hoe Mountain is my mountain

1215
01:48:14,940 --> 01:48:18,270
Mom, Grandpa.

1216
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:22,610
I brought a very trustworthy man

1217
01:48:35,660 --> 01:48:38,290
Spread it for me

1218
01:48:38,290 --> 01:48:41,170
I'm afraid of heights

1219
01:48:49,010 --> 01:48:54,220
Why did I get married to those men?

1220
01:48:54,220 --> 01:48:56,730
Because you're the ideal man like Hae-jun

1221
01:48:56,730 --> 01:48:59,730
Won't marry me

1222
01:48:59,730 --> 01:49:01,610
Because just talk to me face to face

1223
01:49:01,610 --> 01:49:03,980
and there will be a murder

1224
01:49:03,980 --> 01:49:06,610
Is this a time for jokes?

1225
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:13,410
You still can't sleep after leaving me, right?

1226
01:49:13,410 --> 01:49:15,830
Even if I force myself to close my eyes

1227
01:49:15,830 --> 01:49:18,830
You'll always see me again

1228
01:49:18,830 --> 01:49:22,840
You still can't sleep after leaving me, right?

1229
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:24,250
Even if you force yourself to close your eyes

1230
01:49:24,250 --> 01:49:28,090
And always see me putting

1231
01:49:28,090 --> 01:49:34,930
Don't you?

1232
01:49:34,930 --> 01:49:37,930
I ran into me at the market the other night

1233
01:49:37,940 --> 01:49:41,400
Did you suddenly feel like you were alive again?

1234
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:43,900
I ran into me at the market the other night

1235
01:49:43,900 --> 01:49:48,320
Did you suddenly feel like you were alive again?

1236
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:50,110
Finally...

1237
01:49:55,450 --> 01:49:59,330
Now my hands are soft too, right?

1238
01:50:12,390 --> 01:50:15,510
For the past 402 days, you...

1239
01:50:18,930 --> 01:50:20,810
You...

1240
01:50:28,940 --> 01:50:29,610
Even if that's the case

1241
01:50:29,610 --> 01:50:33,910
But the fact that I'm a cop and you're a suspect doesn't change that

1242
01:50:36,490 --> 01:50:38,540
You know what suspect means, right?

1243
01:50:38,540 --> 01:50:41,000
People Suspected by Police

1244
01:50:42,460 --> 01:50:44,500
I like that.

1245
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:48,210
You take it easy on me

1246
01:50:48,210 --> 01:50:51,380
Just like it's always been

1247
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:53,380
In the same way that you treat suspects

1248
01:50:57,010 --> 01:51:00,640
Are you curious about why I like you

1249
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:02,890
Or are you just not interested?

1250
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:06,860
What about you, Rileys?

1251
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:15,450
Body...very stiff

1252
01:51:15,450 --> 01:51:19,080
Few people are that stiff if they're not tense.

1253
01:51:22,210 --> 01:51:25,960
I think I've said a lot about you

1254
01:51:44,190 --> 01:51:47,310
What happened to the four fentanyl here

1255
01:52:06,380 --> 01:52:09,340
Carrying it back and forth during this time

1256
01:52:09,340 --> 01:52:11,670
It's too heavy

1257
01:52:15,010 --> 01:52:17,430
Goodbye, Grandpa.

1258
01:52:32,440 --> 01:52:35,610
Bye Mom

1259
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:08,640
I thought I told you to throw it away so no one could find it.

1260
01:53:12,020 --> 01:53:15,150
Use this to restart the investigation

1261
01:53:15,150 --> 01:53:18,150
Restore data back to the old days

1262
01:53:42,260 --> 01:53:46,970
I might be trying to be Hae-jun your unsolved case

1263
01:53:46,980 --> 01:53:49,140
That's why I went to Iripo, right?

1264
01:55:09,850 --> 01:55:12,980
- Director Lee
- Yes

1265
01:55:14,230 --> 01:55:15,810
This is the first time you've seen him, right?

1266
01:55:15,810 --> 01:55:18,360
He said he got divorced not long ago

1267
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:21,940
I'm Li Jun, I've heard a lot about you

1268
01:55:33,370 --> 01:55:35,500
No snow here?

1269
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:37,170
What

1270
01:55:46,850 --> 01:55:49,470
What about our problem with that

1271
01:55:49,470 --> 01:55:50,720
What's the problem

1272
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:55,810
The one that I promised to do every week even if I hate it and am bored with it

1273
01:55:55,810 --> 01:55:57,940
Can you give way, please?

1274
01:56:09,950 --> 01:56:13,160
Can you sleep?

1275
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:14,960
I went to the hospital for a checkup

1276
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:19,290
I woke up 47 times in one hour

1277
01:56:19,290 --> 01:56:21,050
Do you believe it?

1278
01:56:23,510 --> 01:56:25,670
I wish I could give you a piece of my sleep

1279
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:27,680
Just like a battery

1280
01:56:30,260 --> 01:56:32,430
It says it's like that because I breathe through my mouth

1281
01:56:36,140 --> 01:56:39,650
I have to use a machine that assists me in breathing through my nose when I sleep

1282
01:56:39,650 --> 01:56:41,400
There are machines like that

1283
01:56:44,110 --> 01:56:45,280
That's weird.

1284
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:47,360
I'm obviously breathing through my nose when I'm awake

1285
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,840
But that doesn't mean I snore when I sleep

1286
01:57:08,930 --> 01:57:10,760
I know

1287
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:24,690
Sunbathing Vitamin D

1288
01:57:24,690 --> 01:57:26,690
Not bad for a long time, right?

1289
01:57:26,700 --> 01:57:28,990
30 minutes have passed

1290
01:57:33,370 --> 01:57:36,160
I spoke to the sea maid teachers

1291
01:57:36,160 --> 01:57:38,290
If you see the phone while fishing for abalone

1292
01:57:38,290 --> 01:57:40,420
Make sure to bring it to us

1293
01:57:40,420 --> 01:57:46,010
Can this recover data?

1294
01:59:02,870 --> 01:59:06,840
The morning of the day your mother died, you saw Song Rilai, right?

1295
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:08,710
She came to visit

1296
01:59:08,710 --> 01:59:10,630
early in the morning

1297
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:19,060
She said it would be hard for her if my mother left like that

1298
01:59:19,060 --> 01:59:21,230
After all, we're all Chinese

1299
01:59:21,230 --> 01:59:24,480
Didn't you advise her to use any medicine?

1300
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:27,230
Like it works for diabetes or something like that.

1301
01:59:27,230 --> 01:59:29,230
It's a lime green capsule

1302
01:59:29,230 --> 01:59:30,990
Compared to this

1303
01:59:30,990 --> 01:59:34,530
That woman knows how to serve her patients

1304
01:59:34,530 --> 01:59:38,740
My mother was in a very good mood.

1305
01:59:38,740 --> 01:59:41,790
So I went out for breakfast too

1306
01:59:41,790 --> 01:59:44,790
When I came back from eating Song Rilai had already left

1307
01:59:44,790 --> 01:59:48,090
Where's my mom, lying comfortably with her eyes closed

1308
01:59:48,090 --> 01:59:52,760
said somehow feeling a little sleepy

1309
01:59:52,760 --> 01:59:55,260
And then just...

1310
01:59:57,800 --> 02:00:03,810
But what does my mother's death have to do with the two presses of Song Rilai?

1311
02:00:05,980 --> 02:00:11,030
Didn't Tieshi say he had location software installed on his phone?

1312
02:00:20,740 --> 02:00:22,330
Haijun

1313
02:00:22,330 --> 02:00:24,500
I privately fixed Lim Ho Shin's phone

1314
02:00:24,500 --> 02:00:27,710
There are no audio files

1315
02:00:27,710 --> 02:00:29,840
The person who killed your husband was indeed Steichen

1316
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:33,010
But you killed Stetson's mother.

1317
02:00:33,010 --> 02:00:38,680
Because Stetson said he would kill your husband if his mother died

1318
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:42,890
Your husband, Tieshi's mother

1319
02:00:45,980 --> 02:00:48,440
All died because of me, right?

1320
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:55,780
I'm the one who's going to die anyway

1321
02:00:55,780 --> 02:00:59,570
Why are you so eager to give her fentanyl?

1322
02:00:59,570 --> 02:01:02,410
Because she said thank you to me

1323
02:01:09,580 --> 02:01:12,630
What is the audio that Lin Haoxin said he was going to explode

1324
02:01:12,630 --> 02:01:15,170
You don't have to worry about that one

1325
02:01:15,170 --> 02:01:18,220
I'm not just saying that because I'm worried

1326
02:01:18,220 --> 02:01:20,340
You have the original, right?

1327
02:01:20,350 --> 02:01:23,140
What is it about?

1328
02:01:23,140 --> 02:01:25,270
It's your voice

1329
02:01:25,270 --> 02:01:28,100
What

1330
02:01:28,100 --> 02:01:29,190
Say to me

1331
02:01:29,190 --> 02:01:31,610
I love you for...

1332
02:01:35,610 --> 02:01:37,440
me?

1333
02:01:39,070 --> 02:01:42,160
I keep listening to it because I like it so much

1334
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:47,080
So my husband found out

1335
02:01:49,210 --> 02:01:51,670
When did I ever say I love you

1336
02:01:54,130 --> 02:01:55,710
When

1337
02:02:11,560 --> 02:02:14,060
The moment you said you loved me

1338
02:02:14,070 --> 02:02:16,360
And your love ends

1339
02:02:19,820 --> 02:02:22,360
The Moment Your Love Ends

1340
02:02:23,240 --> 02:02:25,990
And my love begins

1341
02:02:25,990 --> 02:02:27,910
Tell me in Korean

1342
02:02:29,660 --> 02:02:31,670
Seo-rae

1343
02:02:33,540 --> 02:02:35,290
Haijun

1344
02:02:37,340 --> 02:02:40,090
The phone that was fished out of the sea

1345
02:02:40,090 --> 02:02:42,090
Throw it away again

1346
02:02:44,350 --> 02:02:49,850
Throw it into the deeper ocean

1347
02:02:49,850 --> 02:02:54,060
Why are you always saying irrelevant things? It's killing me!

1348
02:02:56,190 --> 02:02:58,110
Riley, where are you going?

1349
02:03:01,240 --> 02:03:02,990
Rileys

1350
02:03:02,990 --> 02:03:05,240
Talking

1351
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:06,950
Talk

1352
02:04:33,250 --> 02:04:35,210
Rileys

1353
02:05:35,480 --> 02:05:39,480
After getting me on the bus

1354
02:06:07,670 --> 02:06:12,890
It should be easy to delete all the files I've recorded.

1355
02:06:12,890 --> 02:06:17,270
I'll help you if you give me a little indication that you like me.

1356
02:06:17,270 --> 02:06:19,310
The thing about us--

1357
02:06:21,190 --> 02:06:23,610
You throw this number into the ocean

1358
02:06:26,730 --> 02:06:32,160
Throw it into the deepest part of the ocean and don't let anyone find it

1359
02:06:46,590 --> 02:06:48,260
Throw the number into the sea

1360
02:06:48,260 --> 02:06:52,050
Throw it into the sea

1361
02:06:52,050 --> 02:06:54,640
Throw into the deepest

1362
02:06:54,640 --> 02:06:59,720
Don't let anyone find it

1363
02:07:22,170 --> 02:07:26,170
I might be trying to be Hae-jun your unsolved case

1364
02:07:26,170 --> 02:07:28,500
That's why I went to Iripo, right?

1365
02:07:30,920 --> 02:07:40,850
You should put a picture of me on the wall and think about me so much you can't sleep

1366
02:08:00,830 --> 02:08:03,210
Riley

1367
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:18,030
Where the hell are you

1368
02:09:37,930 --> 02:09:40,590
Hey, we're putting out an emergency APB to the General Administration.

1369
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:45,720
Near the rocks of the sea, the tide is rising around us.

1370
02:09:45,730 --> 02:09:48,140
Let all those who can come, come together

1371
02:09:48,140 --> 02:09:50,400
Riley is gone

1372
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:55,070
We should be able to find her if we look quickly. She hasn't gone far.

1373
02:09:55,070 --> 02:09:57,690
If you have time to ask me, why don't you come here soon?

1374
02:09:57,700 --> 02:10:00,990
In a few minutes, I won't be able to see anything.

1375
02:10:38,190 --> 02:10:42,490
Obsessed with beauty, delaying investigation

1376
02:10:44,620 --> 02:10:50,370
I've...completely fallen apart

1377
02:10:53,710 --> 02:10:58,840
I've used the same criteria to change money for my grandmother

1378
02:10:58,840 --> 02:11:02,300
She was completely unaware of it

1379
02:11:02,300 --> 02:11:06,220
Throw this number in the ocean

1380
02:11:06,220 --> 02:11:11,180
Throw it into the deepest part of the ocean. Don't let anyone find it.

1381
02:11:17,230 --> 02:11:20,400
Throw this number into the ocean

1382
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:26,450
This is your voice, your voice that loves me

1383
02:12:08,490 --> 02:12:10,580
Riley

1384
02:12:14,420 --> 02:12:16,750
Ralai

1385
02:12:21,630 --> 02:12:23,880
Rileys

1386
02:12:32,060 --> 02:12:34,230
Ralai

1387
02:12:39,440 --> 02:12:41,730
Raleigh

1388
02:12:57,750 --> 02:13:00,000
Rileys
