1
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,843
<i> From Adam to Seth,
from Seth to Enosh,</i>

2
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,444
<i>Enosh to Kenan,
Kenan to Mahalalel</i>

3
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,726
<i>to my father, Methuselah,
then to me.</i>

4
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,051
<i>Today, that birthright
passes to you,</i>

5
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,366
<i>Noah.</i>

6
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,484
<i>My son.</i>

7
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,680
<i>The Creator made Adam
in His image,</i>

8
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,331
<i>and then placed
the world in his care.</i>

9
00:02:44,285 --> 00:02:48,683
<i>This is your work now.
Your responsibility.</i>

10
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,171
<i>May you walk
alongside The Creator in righteousness.</i>

11
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,130
<i>So I say to you...</i>

12
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,960
<i>The Shrine of Seth!</i>

13
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,925
<i>Men.</i>

14
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,531
<i>Hide.</i>

15
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,523
<i>We mine here.</i>

16
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,451
<i>The ground is rich with tzohar.</i>

17
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,164
<i>This is The Creator's land.
What are you doing?</i>

18
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,600
<i>The Creator?</i>

19
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,968
<i>My mines run dry.</i>

20
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,805
<i>My city withers and must be fed.</i>

21
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,883
<i>And what has He done?</i>

22
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,051
<i>He cursed us to struggle</i>

23
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,322
<i>by the sweat of
our brow to survive!</i>

24
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,087
<i>Damned if I don't do
everything it takes</i>

25
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,650
<i>to do just that.</i>

26
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,323
<i>Damned if I don't take
what I want.</i>

27
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,963
<i>This relic belongs to
the descendants of Cain now.</i>

28
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,929
<i>The line of Seth ends here.</i>

29
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,484
<i>It is ours. Now dig!</i>

30
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,407
<i><i Ham.</i>

31
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,011
<i>What are you doing?</i>

32
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,010
<i>It's pretty.</i>

33
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,206
<i>You see those other flowers?</i>

34
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,565
<i>How they're attached
to the ground?</i>

35
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,764
<i>That's where they should be.</i>

36
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,609
<i>They have a purpose.</i>

37
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,081
<i>They sprout.</i>

38
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,046
<i>And they bloom.</i>

39
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,766
<i>The wind takes their seeds
and more flowers grow.</i>

40
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,921
<i>We only collect
what we can use, and what we need.</i>

41
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,886
<i>Do you understand?</i>

42
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,881
<i>Shem.</i>

43
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,761
<i>Ham.</i>

44
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,366
<i>Let's go.</i>

45
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,807
<i>Men. Hide, hide.</i>

46
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,201
<i>Go.</i>

47
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,321
<i>< You found our kill.
</i>

48
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,011
<i>How fortunate.</i>

49
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,646
<i>But for you... maybe not.</i>

50
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,126
<i>You know how long it is
since we ate meat?</i>

51
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,602
<i>Since we even saw an animal?</i>

52
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,961
<i>Easy.</i>

53
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,883
<i>Please. What do you want?</i>

54
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,366
<i>Justice.</i>

55
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,321
<i>Why did they kill it?</i>

56
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,526
<i>They eat them.</i>

57
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,051
<i>Why?</i>

58
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,210
<i>They think it makes them stronger.</i>

59
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,491
<i>Is it true?</i>

60
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,844
<i>They forget</i>

61
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,922
<i>strength comes from The Creator.</i>

62
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,765
<i> Mama!</i>

63
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,281
<i>Mommy!</i>

64
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,320
<i> See your brothers?</i>

65
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,891
<i>Ham saw men hunting today.</i>

66
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,444
<i>They are getting closer.</i>

67
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,561
<i>How was he?</i>

68
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,481
<i>A little too interested.</i>

69
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,840
<i>Hmm.</i>

70
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,445
<i>He had to see it sometime.</i>

71
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,764
<i>I saw something else.</i>

72
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,924
<i>A flower</i>

73
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,285
<i>bloom from nothing.</i>

74
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,685
<i>Rest.</i>

75
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,125
<i>Perhaps He will finally
make things right.</i>

76
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,491
<i>Methuselah.</i>

77
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,929
<i> Did He speak to you?</i>

78
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,330
<i> I think so.</i>

79
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,971
<i>Will He help us?</i>

80
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,328
<i>He's going to destroy the world.</i>

81
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,411
<i> It's a long and dangerous
journey for the boys.</i>

82
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,321
<i>How do you know your
grandfather's still alive?</i>

83
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,525
<i>I don't.
I saw his mountain.</i>

84
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,011
<i>We need to go and find out
if he knows what we're to do.</i>

85
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,441
<i> Shem.
Can you help me with this?</i>

86
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,286
<i>We could take the boys
and find a place to hide.</i>

87
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,450
<i>There'll be no hiding.</i>

88
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,044
<i>We should have left already.</i>

89
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,689
<i> Ham, let me
show you how to do that.</i>

90
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,201
<i>Push it in here.</i>

91
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,566
<i>Next time we come through,</i>

92
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,688
<i>we'll know we've got certain
things we might need.</i>

93
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,324
<i> There are cities ahead.</i>

94
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,642
<i> We will not get too close.</i>

95
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,009
<i>Is that a tzohar mine?</i>

96
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,082
<i> it was once.
Before they dug it all up.</i>

97
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,210
<i>Should we go around?</i>

98
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,681
<i>No.</i>

99
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,600
<i>Do you think they're all dead?</i>

100
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,121
<i>It looks that way.</i>

101
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,000
<i>They must have
been scavenging here.</i>

102
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,125
<i>And someone scavenged from them.</i>

103
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,600
<i> Dada!</i>

104
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,450
<i>Stay close.</i>

105
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,961
<i>Father!</i>

106
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,481
<i>Here!</i>

107
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,285
<i>May I see?</i>

108
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,327
<i>Let me see.</i>

109
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,450
<i>Tell me your name.</i>

110
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,171
<i>You have a name?</i>

111
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,321
<i>Ila.</i>

112
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,450
<i>My name is Ila.</i>

113
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,601
<i> Ila.</i>

114
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,325
<i>You're going to be
all right, Ila.</i>

115
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,486
<i>This is Shem.</i>

116
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,770
<i>He's going to
hold your hand tight</i>

117
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,325
<i>and he won't let go.</i>

118
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,802
<i><i Up the hill!
Hurry! Hurry!</i>

119
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,888
<i>We have to go. Now.</i>

120
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,486
<i> Up the hill. Run.</i>

121
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,286
<i> We can't go there.</i>

122
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,171
<i> We have no choice.
Hurry!</i>

123
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,921
<i>- Hold, men! Hold!
-  The giants!</i>

124
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,726
<i> They'll kill you!</i>

125
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,841
<i> Shem!</i>

126
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,728
<i>Protect your mother,
first and last.</i>

127
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,087
<i>I love you.</i>

128
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,761
<i>Run!</i>

129
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,049
<i>Noah!</i>

130
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,965
<i> Noah!</i>

131
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,203
<i>Noah. Noah.
Are you all right?</i>

132
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,483
<i>We are to see Methuselah.
My grandfather.</i>

133
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,081
<i>A child of the old one?</i>

134
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,082
<i>You should have killed them.</i>

135
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,611
<i> But, Samyaza...
- This is a man, Og.</i>

136
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,645
<i>Do you forget how
they betrayed The Creator?</i>

137
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,845
<i>It is He who sends us!</i>

138
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,363
<i> It lies!</i>

139
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,806
<i>Leave them here to rot.</i>

140
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,521
<i>What are they?</i>

141
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,164
<i>The Watchers.</i>

142
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,365
<i> Dada?</i>

143
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,401
<i>Sleep now.</i>

144
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,244
<i>Sing to me.</i>

145
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,848
<i>I want my daddy to sing to me.</i>

146
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,170
<i>You know, I, too, lost my father</i>

147
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,810
<i>when I was very young.</i>

148
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,410
<i>There's a song he used
to sing me sometimes</i>

149
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,885
<i>when I couldn't sleep.</i>

150
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,050
<i>Would you like to hear it?</i>

151
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,321
<i>The moon is high</i>

152
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,887
<i>The trees entwine</i>

153
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,567
<i>Your Father waits for thee</i>

154
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,690
<i>To wrap you in
His sheltering wings</i>

155
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,768
<i>And whisper you to sleep</i>

156
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,124
<i>Your Father is</i>

157
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,409
<i>The healing wind</i>

158
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,726
<i>That whispers you to sleep</i>

159
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,367
<i>That whispers as you sleep</i>

160
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,445
<i> It's an ugly wound.</i>

161
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,925
<i>She'll never have children.</i>

162
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,810
<i>If the fever doesn't take her,</i>

163
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,646
<i>I think she'll live.</i>

164
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,930
<i> Follow me.</i>

165
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,167
<i>I'm sorry I frightened you.</i>

166
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,961
<i>Watchers have learned
to fear men.</i>

167
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,329
<i> Then why
are you helping us?</i>

168
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,641
<i>The Creator formed us
on the second day.</i>

169
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,843
<i>The day He made the heavens.</i>

170
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,280
<i>We watched over Adam and Eve.</i>

171
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,926
<i>Saw their frailty and their love.</i>

172
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,682
<i>And then we saw their fall.
And we pitied them.</i>

173
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,685
<i>We were not stone then,
but light.</i>

174
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,531
<i>It was not our place
to interfere.</i>

175
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,804
<i>Yet we chose to try
and help mankind.</i>

176
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,725
<i>And when we disobeyed
The Creator,</i>

177
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,729
<i>He punished us.</i>

178
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,964
<i>We were encrusted by your world.</i>

179
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,889
<i>Rock and mud
shackled our fiery glow.</i>

180
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,963
<i>Still, we taught mankind
all we knew of Creation.</i>

181
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,850
<i>With our help</i>

182
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,404
<i>they rose from the dust,
became great and mighty.</i>

183
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,531
<i>But then they turned
our gifts to violence.</i>

184
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,051
<i>Only one man protected us.</i>

185
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,281
<i>Your grandfather Methuselah.</i>

186
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,322
<i>We were hunted.
Most of us killed.</i>

187
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,766
<i>Those who lived
were left prisoners in these stony shells,</i>

188
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,851
<i>marooned upon this barren land.</i>

189
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,760
<i>We begged The Creator
to take us home.</i>

190
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,601
<i>But He was always silent.</i>

191
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,285
<i>And now</i>

192
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,085
<i>you claim that you have
heard His call.</i>

193
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,682
<i>Samyaza cannot accept this.</i>

194
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,371
<i>A man?</i>

195
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,284
<i>When it is men
who broke the world.</i>

196
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,728
<i>But I look at you</i>

197
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,765
<i>and I see a glimmer
of Adam again.</i>

198
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,930
<i>The man I knew.</i>

199
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,487
<i>The man I came to help.</i>

200
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,129
<i>Why can't I come?</i>

201
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,484
<i>Because I need you
to look after Mother.</i>

202
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,685
<i>Do you understand?</i>

203
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,360
<i> And you
look after your father.</i>

204
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,850
<i>Watch over them.</i>

205
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,004
<i>They are in good hands.</i>

206
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,880
<i>Grandfather?</i>

207
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,881
<i> Noah.</i>

208
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,689
<i>This is your great-grandfather.</i>

209
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,041
<i>Show him respect.</i>

210
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,571
<i>Tell him your name.</i>

211
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,406
<i>I am Shem.</i>

212
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,726
<i>My eldest.</i>

213
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,406
<i>Come closer.</i>

214
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,406
<i>Let me see you.</i>

215
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,646
<i>You're a lucky boy.</i>

216
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,441
<i>I think you must have
your mother's looks,</i>

217
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,925
<i>not your father's.</i>

218
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,209
<i>Come tell me about yourself.</i>

219
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,046
<i>So,</i>

220
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,771
<i>what do you like
most in the world?</i>

221
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,801
<i>Berries.</i>

222
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,242
<i>- What?
- Berries.</i>

223
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,845
<i>Ah, berries, yes.</i>

224
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,964
<i>What can compete with
fresh, ripe berries? Nothing.</i>

225
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,601
<i>Yes, it's been so long
I can barely</i>

226
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,449
<i>remember the taste of them.</i>

227
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,571
<i>Ah, tell me,
did you bring me any?</i>

228
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,926
<i>No? Oh.</i>

229
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,963
<i>I'm craving them now.</i>

230
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,162
<i>Ah, well, perhaps one day.</i>

231
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,563
<i>You must be tired.
It's a long way up here.</i>

232
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,801
<i>Yeah.</i>

233
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,287
<i>Why not rest?</i>

234
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,691
<i>How perfect.</i>

235
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,686
<i>What we need to discuss
is not for boys.</i>

236
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,761
<i>You know why I've come?</i>

237
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,606
<i>Yes.</i>

238
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,325
<i>Before he walked on,</i>

239
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,286
<i>my father Enoch told me
that one day,</i>

240
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,968
<i>if man continued in his ways,</i>

241
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,967
<i>The Creator would
annihilate this world.</i>

242
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,804
<i>So what I saw is true?</i>

243
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,326
<i>All life blotted out
because of what man has done?</i>

244
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,329
<i>Can it not be averted?</i>

245
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,801
<i>Noah, you must trust
that He speaks in a way</i>

246
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,121
<i>that you can understand.</i>

247
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,886
<i>So you tell me.</i>

248
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,163
<i>Can this destruction be averted?</i>

249
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,727
<i>No.</i>

250
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,166
<i>Oh.</i>

251
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,640
<i>He sent me here.</i>

252
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,681
<i>Why send me if there's
nothing I can do to stop it?</i>

253
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,566
<i>Well, perhaps He simply sends
you here to share a cup of tea</i>

254
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,205
<i>with an old man.</i>

255
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,328
<i>So, is that all you saw?</i>

256
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,085
<i>The fires of destruction
on this place?</i>

257
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,207
<i>No, not fire.</i>

258
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,406
<i>Water.</i>

259
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,001
<i>Water? Huh.</i>

260
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,128
<i>My father said it would be fire.</i>

261
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,885
<i>I saw water.
Death by water.</i>

262
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,525
<i>I saw death.</i>

263
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,843
<i>And I saw new life.</i>

264
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,563
<i>There's something more, Grandfather.</i>

265
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,409
<i>Something I'm to do.</i>

266
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,080
<i>I know it.</i>

267
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,129
<i>I just didn't see what it was.</i>

268
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,245
<i>New life.</i>

269
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,206
<i>Well, perhaps there is
more for you to see.</i>

270
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,921
<i>Did He not send you here</i>

271
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,202
<i>to drink a cup of tea
with an old man?</i>

272
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,082
<i>The medicine always tastes bad.</i>

273
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,166
<i> She was
the only one moving.</i>

274
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,480
<i>Was she hurt badly?</i>

275
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,563
<i> She had
a big cut on her belly.</i>

276
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,007
<i>Mother helped
and I held her hand.</i>

277
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,847
<i>That must have
made her feel safe.</i>

278
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,527
<i>Well?</i>

279
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,325
<i>Fire consumes all.</i>

280
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,844
<i>Water cleanses.</i>

281
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,282
<i>It separates the foul
from the pure.</i>

282
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,369
<i>The wicked from the innocent.</i>

283
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,282
<i>And that which sinks
from that which rises.</i>

284
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,371
<i>He destroys all,</i>

285
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,003
<i>but only to start again.</i>

286
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,847
<i>You sure?</i>

287
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,161
<i>Yes.</i>

288
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,802
<i>The storm cannot be stopped.</i>

289
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,889
<i>But it can be survived.</i>

290
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,240
<i>Yeah.</i>

291
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,929
<i>You may need this.</i>

292
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,486
<i>It's a seed.</i>

293
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,729
<i>From the first Garden.</i>

294
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,205
<i>From Eden.</i>

295
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,770
<i>Remember, Noah,</i>

296
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,567
<i>He chose you for a reason.</i>

297
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,206
<i>OG: Oh...</i>

298
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,370
<i> You can't get me!</i>

299
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,727
<i>Oh, you can't get me!</i>

300
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,206
<i>Dada!</i>

301
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,246
<i> My grandfather lives.</i>

302
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,042
<i>He's helped me see
what we're here to do.</i>

303
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,250
<i>Men are going to be punished</i>

304
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,760
<i>for what they've done
to this world.</i>

305
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,410
<i>There will be destruction.</i>

306
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,930
<i>There will be tragedy.</i>

307
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,046
<i>And our family has been
chosen for a great task.</i>

308
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,889
<i>We've been chosen
to save the innocent.</i>

309
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,926
<i>The innocent?</i>

310
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,566
<i>The animals.</i>

311
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,926
<i>Why are they innocent?</i>

312
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,281
<i>Because they still live
as they did in the Garden.</i>

313
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,647
<i>Yes.</i>

314
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,444
<i>And we need to save enough
of them to start again.</i>

315
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,926
<i>But what of us?</i>

316
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,082
<i>I guess we get
to start again, too.</i>

317
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,324
<i>We get to start again
in a new and better world.</i>

318
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,851
<i>But first</i>

319
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,167
<i>we have to build.</i>

320
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,126
<i>Build what?</i>

321
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,443
<i> A great flood is coming.</i>

322
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,726
<i>The waters of the heavens</i>

323
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,211
<i>will meet the waters
of the earth.</i>

324
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,601
<i>We build a vessel
to survive the storm.</i>

325
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,325
<i>We build an ark.</i>

326
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,369
<i>Take the traitor back.</i>

327
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,007
<i> He is a child
of the old one!</i>

328
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,686
<i>- Stop!</i>

329
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,411
<i>There is work to do.
Help us.</i>

330
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,366
<i>- Help you?
</i>

331
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,251
<i>We tried to help your kind once.</i>

332
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,370
<i>And we lost everything
because of you!</i>

333
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,924
<i>Not everything.</i>

334
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,846
<i>We can save what is left.
We can serve Him again.</i>

335
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,568
<i>You treacherous snake!</i>

336
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,209
<i>The Creator.</i>

337
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,285
<i> Children!</i>

338
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,801
<i>What is this?</i>

339
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,806
<i>This...</i>

340
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,524
<i>This is our ark.</i>

341
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,330
<i>We will help this man.</i>

342
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,325
<i>No! </i>

343
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,566
<i>Shem.</i>

344
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,766
<i>Wait.</i>

345
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,646
<i>Please.</i>

346
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,605
<i>It still hurts?</i>

347
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,004
<i>- Ham!
- Shem!</i>

348
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,284
<i>He doesn't have anyone.</i>

349
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,846
<i> Come.</i>

350
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,569
<i>Father, did you see them?</i>

351
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,526
<i>Father?</i>

352
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,371
<i>Yes, Japheth.</i>

353
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,571
<i>It begins.</i>

354
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,120
<i>Ready?</i>

355
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,964
<i> it sleeps.</i>

356
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,800
<i>Gently.</i>

357
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,886
<i>See, that's a boy one
and that's a girl one.</i>

358
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,281
<i>After the storm,</i>

359
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,850
<i>they'll become a mother
and a father.</i>

360
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,846
<i>And the hatchlings will spread
right across the world.</i>

361
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,526
<i>We have to be gentle with them
and we have to be protective.</i>

362
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,441
<i>If something were to happen,</i>

363
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,006
<i>that would be a small piece
of Creation lost forever.</i>

364
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,440
<i>All of these innocent creatures</i>

365
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,681
<i>are now in our care.</i>

366
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,047
<i>It's our job to look after them.</i>

367
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,205
<i> Father?</i>

368
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,605
<i>All the birds are two.</i>

369
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,401
<i>You have Mother, Shem has Ila.</i>

370
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,890
<i> But what of me?</i>

371
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,886
<i>What of Japheth?</i>

372
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,085
<i>Who is there for us?</i>

373
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,405
<i>Did you see how He made the forest</i>

374
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,090
<i>to give us wood for the ark?</i>

375
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,449
<i>How He sent the birds?</i>

376
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,561
<i>So,</i>

377
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,249
<i>hasn't He sent
everything we need?</i>

378
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,126
<i> Mother!</i>

379
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,211
<i>What is it? What?</i>

380
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,611
<i>Snakes!</i>

381
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,449
<i>- Snakes are coming, too?
- Yeah.</i>

382
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,969
<i>All that creeps,
all that crawls,</i>

383
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,446
<i>all that slithers.</i>

384
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,165
<i>It's all right.</i>

385
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,322
<i> Father! Father!</i>

386
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,329
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

387
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,202
<i>No one will hurt this boy.</i>

388
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,361
<i>What's your name?</i>

389
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,166
<i>- Ham.
- Ham?</i>

390
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,886
<i>Oh.</i>

391
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,524
<i>I am Tubal-cain.</i>

392
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,564
<i>Do you know me?</i>

393
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,850
<i>You don't know your king?</i>

394
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,848
<i>My father says
there can be no king</i>

395
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,570
<i>in The Creator's garden.</i>

396
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,246
<i>Hmm.</i>

397
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,488
<i>Ham, come here.</i>

398
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,128
<i>Do not take my best soldier.</i>

399
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,366
<i>He's nothing of yours.</i>

400
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,442
<i>Look at his hand on that weapon.</i>

401
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,130
<i>I believe he is
something of mine.</i>

402
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,167
<i>Ham.</i>

403
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,926
<i>Leave it.</i>

404
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,046
<i>No, he gave it to me.</i>

405
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,281
<i>Do what I tell you.</i>

406
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,649
<i>When I heard
talk of miracles, I dismissed them.</i>

407
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,887
<i>But then I saw the birds
with my own eyes, flying here,</i>

408
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,286
<i>and I had to come.</i>

409
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,366
<i>There isn't anything
for you here.</i>

410
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,527
<i>No?</i>

411
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,162
<i>This all belongs to me.</i>

412
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,841
<i>This land. This forest.</i>

413
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,842
<i>That stronghold of yours.</i>

414
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,330
<i>Did you really think
you could protect yourself</i>

415
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,811
<i>from me in that?</i>

416
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,884
<i>It's not protection from you.</i>

417
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,845
<i> Then what is it?</i>

418
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,646
<i>An ark</i>

419
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,844
<i>to hold the innocent
when The Creator sends</i>

420
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,202
<i>his deluge to wipe out
the wicked from this world.</i>

421
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,601
<i>The Creator does not care
what happens in this world.</i>

422
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,081
<i>Nobody has heard from Him
since He marked Cain.</i>

423
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,851
<i>We are alone.
Orphaned children,</i>

424
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,684
<i>cursed to struggle by the sweat
of our brow to survive.</i>

425
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,326
<i>Damned if I don't do everything</i>

426
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,767
<i>it takes to
do just that. </i>

427
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,362
<i> Damned if I don't
take what I want.</i>

428
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,770
<i>We have met?</i>

429
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,280
<i>I am the son of Lamech!</i>

430
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,848
<i>Eight generations
descended from Seth!</i>

431
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,930
<i>Return to your cities of Cain!</i>

432
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,728
<i>Know we have all been judged!</i>

433
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,688
<i>I have men at my back,</i>

434
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,842
<i>and you stand alone and defy me?</i>

435
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,241
<i>I'm not alone.</i>

436
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,046
<i> Take the children!</i>

437
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,810
<i>Do not fear, my people!</i>

438
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,562
<i>Don't be afraid! Stand!</i>

439
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,085
<i> Hold your line, men.</i>

440
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,605
<i>His minions, uh,
they're with you?</i>

441
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,601
<i>Hmm.</i>

442
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,809
<i>Miracles?
A deluge, you claim?</i>

443
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,009
<i>Well, perhaps you're right.</i>

444
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,681
<i>Perhaps casting us out
of Paradise was not enough.</i>

445
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,961
<i>Perhaps,</i>

446
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,001
<i>He returns to finish us off.</i>

447
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,805
<i>Well, if He does,</i>

448
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,284
<i>I will ride the storm
in that ship of yours.</i>

449
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,082
<i>There is no escape
for you and your kind.</i>

450
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,764
<i>Your time is done.</i>

451
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,244
<i>- The land is dying.
 Ham.</i>

452
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,600
<i>The cities are dead.</i>

453
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,484
<i> Don't listen to him.</i>

454
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,650
<i>y people follow me!</i>

455
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,647
<i>And more will follow them!</i>

456
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,846
<i>I'm not afraid of miracles,
son of Lamech!</i>

457
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,169
<i>If you refuse my dozens now,</i>

458
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,331
<i>I shall return with legions!</i>

459
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,681
<i> Move.</i>

460
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,571
<i>Father?</i>

461
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,050
<i>Will so many really come?</i>

462
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,525
<i>We need to finish
as fast as we can.</i>

463
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,203
<i>The sooner He sends
the rain, the better.</i>

464
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,525
<i>Until then, we're safer inside.</i>

465
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,045
<i>We build.</i>

466
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,881
<i>First weapons, then men.</i>

467
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,607
<i>Feed only those that will fight.</i>

468
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,046
<i>Arm them,</i>

469
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,806
<i>train them,</i>

470
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,406
<i>and there is nothing
they can't do.</i>

471
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,891
<i>With an army,</i>

472
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,685
<i>we can crush those giants.</i>

473
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,730
<i> Please, we're hungry!</i>

474
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,569
<i> Give us meat.
- Our children are starving.</i>

475
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,766
<i> Please help us!</i>

476
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,685
<i> Let us go!</i>

477
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,969
<i> We're starving!</i>

478
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,200
<i>Should I come back?</i>

479
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,361
<i>No.</i>

480
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,882
<i>Do you think those men
are going to attack us?</i>

481
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,521
<i>When the rain comes.</i>

482
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,045
<i>What do you think it'll be like?</i>

483
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,245
<i>I've imagined it.</i>

484
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,404
<i>Seeing that much death,</i>

485
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:32,091
<i>I'm not sure there are words.</i>

486
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,006
<i>The end of everything.</i>

487
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,766
<i>The beginning.</i>

488
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,050
<i>The beginning of everything.</i>

489
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,160
<i>So what is it?</i>

490
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,242
<i>Whatever he's done or said,
Shem is very fond of you.</i>

491
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,083
<i>Shem needs a woman.</i>

492
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,845
<i>A real woman.</i>

493
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,290
<i>He should have a family.</i>

494
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,285
<i>I can't give any of that to him.</i>

495
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,806
<i>And I'm not going to
deny him those things,</i>

496
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,963
<i>even if he wants me to.</i>

497
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,605
<i>I won't do it.</i>

498
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,121
<i>Besides,</i>

499
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,450
<i>why would The Creator want
a barren girl on His ark?</i>

500
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,289
<i>Ila. Ila.</i>

501
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,963
<i>When we first took you in,</i>

502
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,442
<i>I thought you were
going to be a burden.</i>

503
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,327
<i>And I didn't want to see</i>

504
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,647
<i>anybody else ruined by this world.</i>

505
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,724
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

506
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:49,966
<i>You're a gift.</i>

507
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,971
<i>A precious, precious gift.</i>

508
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,451
<i>Just don't forget
how precious a gift you are.</i>

509
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,961
<i>I know you'll be going to find
wives for Ham and Japheth.</i>

510
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,244
<i>You should find one
for Shem, too.</i>

511
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,685
<i>Ila.</i>

512
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,920
<i> Where do
you think you're going?</i>

513
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,481
<i> Please, please
don't take my baby!</i>

514
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,722
<i>Let them go! Please!</i>

515
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,963
<i>Sorry, we have to eat!</i>

516
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,247
<i>Don't take my baby!
No!</i>

517
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,086
<i>Don't take my baby! No, no,
please will you stop him?</i>

518
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,084
<i>Let them go!</i>

519
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,927
<i>No!</i>

520
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,083
<i>< Quit struggling!
It'll be easier.</i>

521
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,928
<i>Come with me! Stop struggling!</i>

522
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,008
<i>You! You!</i>

523
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:59,126
<i> I have two girls!
I have two girls to trade!</i>

524
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,129
<i>Take the girls!
Give me the meat!</i>

525
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,930
<i>- Give it to me!
</i>

526
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,721
<i>What happened?</i>

527
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,968
<i> All of this
should be inside by now.</i>

528
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,121
<i>The storm is coming.</i>

529
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,486
<i>What about our wives?
Where are they?</i>

530
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,800
<i>Did you not hear
what I just said?</i>

531
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,006
<i>But when are they coming?</i>

532
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,046
<i>There will be no wives.</i>

533
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,484
<i>What? What? No!</i>

534
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,761
<i>You said that The Creator
would give us what we'll need.</i>

535
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,805
<i>- Help your brother.
- No.</i>

536
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,650
<i>Listen, you can't do this!</i>

537
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,484
<i>You can't. How am I
supposed to be a man?</i>

538
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,730
<i>I said help your brother.</i>

539
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,402
<i>- You want me to stay a child!
- No!</i>

540
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:20,486
<i>I'm asking you to be a man
and do what needs to be done.</i>

541
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,446
<i>Ham!</i>

542
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,921
<i>Ham!</i>

543
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,565
<i>
What are you doing, Noah?</i>

544
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,129
<i>The wickedness
is not just in them.</i>

545
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,405
<i>It's in all of us.</i>

546
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,286
<i>I saw it.</i>

547
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,641
<i>No.</i>

548
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:09,801
<i>Noah.</i>

549
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,804
<i>There's goodness in us.</i>

550
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,449
<i>Look at our boys.</i>

551
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:18,246
<i>Shem's loyalty.
Japheth's kindness.</i>

552
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,327
<i>Ham's integrity. Hmm?</i>

553
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,326
<i>Good men.</i>

554
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,162
<i>They'd be good fathers.</i>

555
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,323
<i>Shem is blinded by desire.</i>

556
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,289
<i>Ham is covetous.</i>

557
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,607
<i>And Japheth
lives only to please.</i>

558
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,001
<i>I am no better.</i>

559
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,566
<i>And you?</i>

560
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,561
<i>Is there anything
you would not do,</i>

561
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,967
<i>good or bad,
for those three boys?</i>

562
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,322
<i>We would both choose to kill</i>

563
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,086
<i>in order to protect our children.</i>

564
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,286
<i>Yes.</i>

565
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,851
<i>We're no different.</i>

566
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:54,920
<i>We were weak and we were selfish</i>

567
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,450
<i>to think we could
set ourselves apart.</i>

568
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,685
<i>We will work,</i>

569
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,009
<i>complete the task,</i>

570
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,691
<i>and then we'll die.</i>

571
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,762
<i>The same as everyone else.</i>

572
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:11,685
<i>They are children!</i>

573
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,207
<i>They are our children, Noah!</i>

574
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,363
<i>Have you no mercy?</i>

575
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,882
<i>The time for mercy has passed.</i>

576
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,049
<i>Now our punishment begins.</i>

577
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:58,721
<i>Ham!</i>

578
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:04,767
<i>Ham!</i>

579
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,045
<i>Grandfather?</i>

580
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,125
<i>Grandfather?</i>

581
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,607
<i>Did you bring me something?</i>

582
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,442
<i>Did Noah plant
the seed I gave him?</i>

583
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,601
<i>Yes.</i>

584
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:39,927
<i>Mmm.</i>

585
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,046
<i>And in all that forest
there were no berries?</i>

586
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,602
<i>Shem promised me berries.</i>

587
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,731
<i>On. /i></i>

588
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,041
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

589
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,361
<i>I didn't know.</i>

590
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,601
<i>Huh.</i>

591
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,200
<i>It's a pity.</i>

592
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,722
<i>Then why did you come here?</i>

593
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,966
<i>It's Noah.</i>

594
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,402
<i>He leaves our boys with no one.</i>

595
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,642
<i>Shem has Ila, but she's barren.</i>

596
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:12,322
<i>There'll be no other wives, so</i>

597
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:14,000
<i>no children.</i>

598
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,481
<i>Justice.</i>

599
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:21,242
<i>The Creator destroys this world</i>

600
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,481
<i>because we corrupted it.</i>

601
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,005
<i>So we ourselves
must be destroyed.</i>

602
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,241
<i>No.</i>

603
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:30,001
<i>I can't believe that's true.</i>

604
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,324
<i>Not when I look at my sons.</i>

605
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,288
<i>All they desire is love.</i>

606
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:38,450
<i>Isn't that all their hearts
need to be good?</i>

607
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,007
<i> Who is good?
Who is wicked?</i>

608
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:43,447
<i>How am I supposed to know
what is right?</i>

609
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,448
<i>That choice is Noah's.
Not mine. Not yours.</i>

610
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,682
<i>It sounds like he has made it.</i>

611
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,524
<i>So then you will not help me?</i>

612
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,329
<i>I don't know if I even could.</i>

613
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:03,211
<i>But if I tried,
it could cause pain and possibly tragedy.</i>

614
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:07,327
<i>And in the end,
it would just come back to Noah again.</i>

615
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,360
<i>Is that what you wish?</i>

616
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:14,967
<i>I want my sons to have children.</i>

617
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,326
<i>I want them to be happy.</i>

618
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,484
<i>I can't bear to think of them dying alone.</i>

619
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,370
<i> Out of the way!
Coming through!</i>

620
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,085
<i>Whoa!</i>

621
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,931
<i> Please!</i>

622
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,401
<i>Get away!</i>

623
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,206
<i>No. No, no...</i>

624
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:03,249
<i>It's all right.
It's all right. I'm not...</i>

625
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,606
<i>I'm not going to hurt you.</i>

626
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,888
<i>I have food.</i>

627
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,085
<i>Here.</i>

628
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,406
<i>What do you want?</i>

629
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,205
<i>Nothing.</i>

630
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,885
<i>Are you alone?</i>

631
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:53,561
<i>Yes.</i>

632
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,486
<i>And you?</i>

633
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,683
<i>I can help you get away.</i>

634
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,841
<i>No.</i>

635
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,242
<i>Well, then,
I'll stay a little while.</i>

636
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,524
<i>If that is all right?</i>

637
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,206
<i>My name</i>

638
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,611
<i>is Na'el.</i>

639
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,041
<i> Shem!</i>

640
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,324
<i>Go and find them
and bring them back.</i>

641
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,207
<i>Be careful.</i>

642
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,405
<i>Ham? </i>

643
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,041
<i>Don't be afraid, granddaughter.</i>

644
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,370
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

645
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,001
<i>Grandfather?</i>

646
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,241
<i>Yes.</i>

647
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,846
<i>What are you doing down here?</i>

648
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,922
<i>I'm looking for berries.
I have a craving.</i>

649
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,165
<i>Come and help me look for them.</i>

650
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,083
<i>My eyes aren't as good
as they used to be.</i>

651
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:43,401
<i>I have to find Ham.</i>

652
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:44,720
<i>There's time enough for that.</i>

653
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,366
<i>Come here.</i>

654
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,405
<i>Come.</i>

655
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,684
<i>Come here and help me.</i>

656
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,603
<i>They're here somewhere.</i>

657
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,922
<i>They're here somewhere, berries.</i>

658
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,764
<i>I know there are berries.</i>

659
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,729
<i>There's nothing here,
Grandfather.</i>

660
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,443
<i>- Let me take you to Noah.
- No.</i>

661
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:06,285
<i>No need for that.
You go now.</i>

662
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,091
<i>You go.</i>

663
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,524
<i>Oh, wait. Wait.</i>

664
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,451
<i>Ten years you've been
with my own.</i>

665
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,601
<i>With my own family.</i>

666
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:20,564
<i>Ten years.
And you love them?</i>

667
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,802
<i>Shem? And Noah?</i>

668
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,085
<i>He saved my life.</i>

669
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,970
<i>Raised me.</i>

670
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,805
<i>Yes, he did.</i>

671
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,280
<i>Yes.</i>

672
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,602
<i>And you are now
as his own daughter.</i>

673
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,440
<i>My own great-granddaughter.</i>

674
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:46,325
<i>Ten years in the shadow
of my home,</i>

675
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,485
<i>and yet I have never
given you my blessing.</i>

676
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,481
<i>May I?</i>

677
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,841
<i> Ham! Ila!</i>

678
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,840
<i>You can go now. Go to him.</i>

679
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,683
<i>You go. Go now.</i>

680
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:31,486
<i> Ila!</i>

681
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,166
<i>Ila!</i>

682
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:41,486
<i>Ila!</i>

683
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,290
<i>We have to get back...</i>

684
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:05,611
<i>We have to go.</i>

685
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:08,811
<i>We have to go.
Come on. Now!</i>

686
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,604
<i>I am a man.</i>

687
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,643
<i>Made in Your image.</i>

688
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,723
<i>Why will You
not converse with me?</i>

689
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,324
<i>I give life.</i>

690
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:52,481
<i>I take life away.
As You do!</i>

691
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,844
<i>And I am like You, am I not?</i>

692
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:00,926
<i>Speak to me.</i>

693
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,770
<i>Speak to me!</i>

694
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,849
<i>It has begun!</i>

695
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:23,841
<i>Death comes from the heavens!</i>

696
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,600
<i>This rain</i>

697
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:29,010
<i>is meant to wash us off
the face of this world.</i>

698
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,329
<i>But we are men.</i>

699
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:36,568
<i>We decide if we live or die.</i>

700
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,804
<i>We are men!</i>

701
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:42,804
<i>And men united are invincible!</i>

702
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,570
<i>Do you want to live?</i>

703
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,240
<i> Yeah!</i>

704
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:50,044
<i>We kill the giants!</i>

705
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,731
<i>We kill Noah!</i>

706
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,890
<i>We take the ark!</i>

707
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,401
<i> Yeah!</i>

708
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,721
<i> Noah!</i>

709
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,206
<i>Where's Ham?</i>

710
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,920
<i>Get it off me, no! Ow!</i>

711
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,724
<i>No, no, no!</i>

712
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,566
<i>We have to get away!</i>

713
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:59,449
<i>I won't leave you. I won't!</i>

714
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:02,641
<i> Ham!</i>

715
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,802
<i>Father, help! Help!</i>

716
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:09,963
<i>- Help her!
- Help me, please!</i>

717
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:12,560
<i>Please, help me, please!</i>

718
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,041
<i>Please...
Someone please help me!</i>

719
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,131
<i>Help me!</i>

720
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,084
<i>No!</i>

721
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,322
<i> Ham! Ham!</i>

722
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,165
<i>Ham!</i>

723
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,321
<i>Ham!</i>

724
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,850
<i>Ham!</i>

725
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,805
<i>Ham!</i>

726
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:56,966
<i>Ham!</i>

727
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,889
<i>Samyaza!</i>

728
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,048
<i>Samyaza! Samyaza!</i>

729
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,049
<i>- Noah!
- Where is Ham?</i>

730
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,203
<i>Ham is through! Quickly!</i>

731
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,166
<i>Run!</i>

732
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,406
<i> Ham.</i>

733
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:38,401
<i>Ham!</i>

734
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:52,411
<i> Faster!</i>

735
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:56,891
<i>Forward!</i>

736
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,322
<i>Protect your mother.
Protect them all.</i>

737
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,925
<i>Part!</i>

738
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:56,965
<i> My Creator,</i>

739
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,850
<i>forgive me.</i>

740
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:13,524
<i>The Creator brings him home.</i>

741
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:39,841
<i> Ham?</i>

742
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,126
<i>Ham?</i>

743
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,009
<i>Shem. Shem, go inside.</i>

744
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,126
<i>Go inside.</i>

745
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,280
<i>They are upon us. Go inside!</i>

746
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,482
<i>Good-bye, son of Adam.</i>

747
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:41,690
<i>Son, where are you?</i>

748
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,481
<i>Ham!</i>

749
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:48,881
<i>Ham?</i>

750
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:54,731
<i>Ham?</i>

751
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:56,601
<i>It's all right.</i>

752
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,446
<i> Shem!
 Father!</i>

753
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,249
<i> Japheth,
where are you?</i>

754
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,401
<i>< Ila, I'm here!
 Father!</i>

755
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:35,687
<i><Mother, where's Father?</i>

756
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,849
<i>Please, Noah,</i>

757
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,407
<i>there must be
something we can do.</i>

758
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:54,008
<i>We can drag ropes.</i>

759
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,566
<i>They cannot all be soldiers, Father.</i>

760
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:01,409
<i>They are just people.
And there's room.</i>

761
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:03,888
<i>There is no room for them.</i>

762
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:55,162
<i>Soon everything
we knew will be gone.</i>

763
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,970
<i>All that is left of Creation
will lie within these walls.</i>

764
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:03,646
<i>Outside,</i>

765
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,647
<i>just the waters of chaos again.</i>

766
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:11,005
<i>You are angry.</i>

767
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,810
<i>You judge me.</i>

768
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:17,810
<i>Let me tell you a story.</i>

769
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:20,921
<i>The first story
my father told me,</i>

770
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,770
<i>and the first story
that I told each of you.</i>

771
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:33,804
<i>In the beginning,</i>

772
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,166
<i>there was nothing.</i>

773
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:41,489
<i>Nothing but the silence
of an infinite darkness.</i>

774
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,208
<i>But the breath of The Creator
fluttered against</i>

775
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:45,885
<i>the face of the void,
whispering,</i>

776
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,050
<i>"Let there be light."</i>

777
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,011
<i>And light was.</i>

778
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,846
<i>And it was good.</i>

779
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,731
<i>The first day.</i>

780
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:56,688
<i>And then the formless light</i>

781
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,371
<i>began to take on
substance and shape.</i>

782
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,210
<i>A second day.</i>

783
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,244
<i>And our world was born.</i>

784
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:06,167
<i>Our beautiful, fragile home.</i>

785
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:09,245
<i>And a great, warming light
nurtured its days.</i>

786
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:13,161
<i>And a lesser light
ruled the nights.</i>

787
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:16,644
<i>And there was evening.
And morning.</i>

788
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:18,685
<i>Another day.</i>

789
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:23,881
<i>And the waters of the world
gathered together,</i>

790
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:27,603
<i>and in their midst
emerged dry land.</i>

791
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,604
<i>Another day passed.</i>

792
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:33,720
<i>And the ground put forth
the growing things.</i>

793
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:34,961
<i>A thick blanket of green</i>

794
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,008
<i>stretching across all Creation.</i>

795
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:40,850
<i>And the waters, too,
teemed with life.</i>

796
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:43,881
<i>Great creatures of the deep
that are no more.</i>

797
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,043
<i>Vast multitudes of fish,</i>

798
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:49,363
<i>some of which may still
swim beneath these seas.</i>

799
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:53,606
<i>And soon the sky
was streaming with birds.</i>

800
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:55,086
<i>And there was evening.</i>

801
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:57,965
<i>And there was morning.
A fifth day.</i>

802
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:00,924
<i>Now the whole world
was full of living beings.</i>

803
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,601
<i>Everything that creeps,
everything that crawls,</i>

804
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,603
<i>and every beast
that walks upon the ground.</i>

805
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,127
<i>And it was good.
It was all good.</i>

806
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,682
<i>There was light
and air and water</i>

807
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:13,127
<i>and soil,
all clean and unspoiled.</i>

808
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,967
<i>There were plants and fish
and fowl and beast,</i>

809
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:17,645
<i>each after their own kind.</i>

810
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,240
<i>All part of the greater whole.
All in their place.</i>

811
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:23,564
<i>And all was in balance.
It was paradise.</i>

812
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,888
<i>A jewel in The Creator's palm.</i>

813
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:31,801
<i>Then The Creator made Man.
And by his side, Woman.</i>

814
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,284
<i>Father and mother of us all.</i>

815
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:37,960
<i>He gave them a choice.</i>

816
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:42,968
<i>Follow the temptation
of darkness</i>

817
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:46,850
<i>or hold on to the
blessing of light.</i>

818
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,168
<i>But they ate from
the forbidden fruit.</i>

819
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:02,642
<i>Their innocence
was extinguished.</i>

820
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:06,324
<i>And so for the ten generations
since Adam, sir.</i>

821
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:08,649
<i>Has walked within us.</i>

822
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:12,969
<i>Brother against brother.</i>

823
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:16,648
<i>Nation against nation.</i>

824
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:19,209
<i>Man against Creation.</i>

825
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:23,009
<i>We murdered each other.</i>

826
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:28,131
<i>We broke the world.
We did this.</i>

827
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:30,329
<i>Man did this.</i>

828
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:33,162
<i>Everything that was beautiful,</i>

829
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,323
<i>everything that was good,</i>

830
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,365
<i>we shattered.</i>

831
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,206
<i>Now,</i>

832
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:42,889
<i>it begins again.</i>

833
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,723
<i>Air, water, earth, plant,
fish, bird and beast.</i>

834
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,249
<i>Paradise returns.</i>

835
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,885
<i>But this time,</i>

836
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:57,004
<i>this time there will be no men.</i>

837
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,207
<i>If we were to enter
the Garden again,</i>

838
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:03,041
<i>it would only be
to destroy it once more.</i>

839
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:04,521
<i>No.</i>

840
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,082
<i>The Creator has judged us.</i>

841
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:11,763
<i>Mankind must end.</i>

842
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,241
<i>Shem and Ila,</i>

843
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:18,524
<i>you will bury your mother and I.</i>

844
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,731
<i>Ham, you will bury them.</i>

845
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:25,761
<i>Japheth will lay you to rest.</i>

846
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:28,570
<i>You, Japheth,</i>

847
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,762
<i>you will be the last man.</i>

848
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:35,404
<i>And in time you, too,
will return to the dust.</i>

849
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:37,922
<i>Creation will be left alone,</i>

850
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:40,282
<i>safe and beautiful.</i>

851
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:46,083
<i>I'm very sorry about that girl.</i>

852
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,204
<i>And I'm sorry for you.</i>

853
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:52,400
<i>But we have been entrusted with a task</i>

854
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:54,761
<i>much greater than our own desires.</i>

855
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,769
<i>Ham.</i>

856
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:43,966
<i> Shh.</i>

857
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:45,527
<i>Noah...</i>

858
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:48,369
<i>Does he know I'm here?</i>

859
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,368
<i>- Does he know I'm here?
- No, no, no. No.</i>

860
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:00,688
<i>Why are you helping me?</i>

861
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:06,764
<i>There was a girl.</i>

862
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,525
<i>I tried to bring her.</i>

863
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,482
<i>But he just let her die.</i>

864
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:17,041
<i>Ah.</i>

865
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:21,722
<i>And now you want revenge.</i>

866
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:25,887
<i>No.</i>

867
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:27,890
<i>Yes, you do.</i>

868
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,209
<i>Yes, you do.</i>

869
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:57,489
<i>There's no more land.</i>

870
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,202
<i>Everything out there
must be dead.</i>

871
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:11,570
<i>It had to be what He wanted.</i>

872
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:14,923
<i>A world without man.</i>

873
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:22,446
<i>You see that, don't you?</i>

874
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:30,531
<i>What l see</i>

875
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:34,921
<i>is how hard this was
for you to do</i>

876
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:38,882
<i>as a man who respects life,</i>

877
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,604
<i>a man who loves his children.</i>

878
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,284
<i>You've been strong.</i>

879
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:53,770
<i>But it's done.</i>

880
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:57,290
<i>It's done now.</i>

881
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,728
<i>And you can put
that burden down.</i>

882
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:07,005
<i>Noah.</i>

883
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:20,246
<i>It's all right.</i>

884
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:30,241
<i>
If your father found me,</i>

885
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:31,651
<i>he would kill me.</i>

886
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:36,124
<i>We must be ready,
but I am too weak.</i>

887
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:42,205
<i>Mmm.</i>

888
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:50,646
<i>What are you doing?</i>

889
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,683
<i>I must get my strength back.</i>

890
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,321
<i>The beasts are precious.
There are only two of each.</i>

891
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:58,522
<i>And there is only one of me.</i>

892
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,126
<i>But the rain,</i>

893
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,169
<i>all these miracles,
are for them.</i>

894
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:03,887
<i>Them?</i>

895
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:08,011
<i>Your father fills
a ship with beasts while children drown.</i>

896
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:11,326
<i>He belittles you by telling you
you must serve them.</i>

897
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:12,960
<i>Oh, no.</i>

898
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:15,400
<i>They serve us.</i>

899
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,522
<i>That is the greatness of men.</i>

900
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:25,206
<i>When The Creator
finished making the sky,</i>

901
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:27,886
<i>the ground, the sea,
and this beast,</i>

902
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,690
<i>He wasn't satisfied.</i>

903
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:33,686
<i>He needed something greater.
Something</i>

904
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:37,727
<i>to take dominion over it
and subdue it.</i>

905
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:40,161
<i>Mmm.</i>

906
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:42,842
<i>So He made us in His image.</i>

907
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:44,526
<i>Us.</i>

908
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,082
<i>This is your world, Ham.</i>

909
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:56,446
<i>Seize it.</i>

910
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:13,406
<i>Ila.</i>

911
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:46,564
<i>Oh, Grandfather.</i>

912
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,806
<i>What is it?</i>

913
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:00,403
<i>You're not sick.</i>

914
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:05,322
<i>But that's impossible.</i>

915
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:19,920
<i>What?</i>

916
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:21,491
<i>What is it?</i>

917
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:24,167
<i>Noah.</i>

918
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:28,931
<i>It is his grandchild.</i>

919
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:48,851
<i>What's wrong?</i>

920
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:51,525
<i>- Father.
- Noah.</i>

921
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,527
<i>We've come to ask
for your blessing.</i>

922
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:00,164
<i>I don't understand.</i>

923
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:02,960
<i>I am with Child.</i>

924
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:11,645
<i>It's not possible.</i>

925
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:15,006
<i>You're barren.</i>

926
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:18,241
<i>You can't conceive. How...</i>

927
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:20,249
<i>- How is that possible?
- Grandfather.</i>

928
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:25,241
<i>- I asked Grandfather...
- To what?</i>

929
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:26,890
<i>Undermine The Creator?</i>

930
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:29,162
<i>To give our children a future.</i>

931
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:31,051
<i>To give humanity a future.</i>

932
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,761
<i>Have you any idea
what you've done?</i>

933
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:37,323
<i>All those lives!
All those people!</i>

934
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:39,086
<i>For nothing!</i>

935
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,321
<i>Do you know what
this forces me to do?</i>

936
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,488
<i>Please! Please!</i>

937
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,251
<i>Please!</i>

938
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:25,449
<i>I cannot do this!</i>

939
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:27,802
<i>Tell me I don't need to do this!</i>

940
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:29,571
<i>Please.</i>

941
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:34,646
<i>Have I not done everything
that You asked of me?</i>

942
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:36,729
<i>Is that not enough?</i>

943
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:41,487
<i>Why do You not answer me?</i>

944
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:44,446
<i>Why?</i>

945
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:05,489
<i>I will not fail You.</i>

946
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:08,649
<i>I will not fail You.</i>

947
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:12,524
<i>I will not fail You.</i>

948
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:18,450
<i>It shall be done.</i>

949
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,564
<i>It shall be done.</i>

950
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:00,366
<i>Father?</i>

951
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:10,091
<i> The rains have stopped.</i>

952
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:13,847
<i>The Creator smiles on our child.</i>

953
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:18,050
<i>The rains have stopped
because of your child, yes,</i>

954
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:20,690
<i>but He does not smile.</i>

955
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:25,323
<i>If your child is a boy,</i>

956
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:29,521
<i>he will replace Japheth,
last man.</i>

957
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:36,046
<i>Ir it is a girl,</i>

958
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:39,522
<i>who could mature into a mother,</i>

959
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:44,211
<i>she must die.</i>

960
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:50,725
<i>Are you mad?</i>

961
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:53,131
<i>That is my Child!</i>

962
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:03,923
<i>If you should bear a girl,</i>

963
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:08,607
<i>in the moment of her birth,
I will cut her down.</i>

964
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:57,968
<i> Mother!</i>

965
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:00,085
<i>Mother, my bird!</i>

966
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:15,849
<i> Nothing. No mud.</i>

967
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:31,686
<i>Nothing.</i>

968
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:35,130
<i>We still have to go.</i>

969
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:37,801
<i>Ila,</i>

970
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:39,686
<i>there's nothing.</i>

971
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:42,569
<i>There's nothing out there.</i>

972
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:46,249
<i>You have food and water
for how long? Weeks?</i>

973
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,650
<i>- A month?
 A month.</i>

974
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:56,486
<i>Please wait.</i>

975
01:41:57,720 --> 01:42:00,200
<i>Wait until the bird finds land.
Please.</i>

976
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:02,641
<i>Japheth, send him again.</i>

977
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:04,320
<i>- He's too tired.
- Then wake another.</i>

978
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:06,725
<i>Here.</i>

979
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:10,251
<i>Please. One that can find us a home.</i>

980
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:21,881
<i>No.</i>

981
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:28,570
<i>We leave today.</i>

982
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:54,124
<i>They will die out there.</i>

983
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:57,285
<i>Not if they stay.</i>

984
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:01,046
<i>And let you kill their Child?</i>

985
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:07,251
<i>Noah.</i>

986
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:09,926
<i>Noah!</i>

987
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:12,884
<i>I did this.</i>

988
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:16,446
<i>I did this, Noah!</i>

989
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:18,441
<i>Please!</i>

990
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:20,930
<i>Punish me!</i>

991
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:24,286
<i>Punish me, Noah!</i>

992
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:27,005
<i>Not them.</i>

993
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:30,129
<i>Not the child.</i>

994
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:32,851
<i>Please.</i>

995
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:36,242
<i>The child is not being punished.</i>

996
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:38,921
<i>We are all being punished.</i>

997
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:41,451
<i>All of us.</i>

998
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:45,762
<i>It's not something I want to do.</i>

999
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:51,809
<i>It's something I have to do.</i>

1000
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:00,686
<i>It is painful,</i>

1001
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,040
<i>but it is just.</i>

1002
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:09,486
<i>Just?</i>

1003
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:12,720
<i>How?</i>

1004
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:17,290
<i>How is this just?</i>

1005
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:21,168
<i>It's a baby, Noah.</i>

1006
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:27,731
<i>If you hold to this,</i>

1007
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:31,845
<i>you will lose your sons,
you will lose Ila,</i>

1008
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:34,244
<i>you will lose me.</i>

1009
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:42,522
<i>I love you, Noah.</i>

1010
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:47,050
<i>And I have
followed you everywhere.</i>

1011
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:48,525
<i>Through everything.</i>

1012
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:50,730
<i>I forgave you.</i>

1013
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:54,164
<i>When everyone was dead,
I forgave you.</i>

1014
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:56,891
<i>I was ready to die with you.</i>

1015
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,331
<i>But this</i>

1016
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:02,242
<i>I will never forgive.</i>

1017
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:05,404
<i>Boy or girl,
I will never forgive!</i>

1018
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:08,889
<i>And you will die alone!
Not just alone, but hated!</i>

1019
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:12,210
<i>Hated by everyone you love!</i>

1020
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:15,249
<i>That is just!</i>

1021
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:19,050
<i>That is just.</i>

1022
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:44,931
<i> Oh...</i>

1023
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:49,406
<i>Oh.</i>

1024
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:52,401
<i>It's time.</i>

1025
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:14,246
<i>Bring him through there.</i>

1026
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:17,330
<i>One blow will finish it.</i>

1027
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:25,490
<i>Just in case, huh?</i>

1028
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:32,483
<i>I don't know if I can.</i>

1029
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:40,130
<i>He killed your woman.</i>

1030
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:42,766
<i>And now he plots to kill
your brother's firstborn.</i>

1031
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:44,649
<i>Is that what you want?</i>

1032
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:48,125
<i>You want your sister
to die on the seas?</i>

1033
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:52,327
<i>A man isn't ruled by the heavens.</i>

1034
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:54,608
<i>A man is ruled by his will.</i>

1035
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:56,605
<i>So I ask you,</i>

1036
01:46:57,320 --> 01:46:58,731
<i>are you a man?</i>

1037
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:10,371
<i>Good.</i>

1038
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:12,682
<i>Because if you're a man,</i>

1039
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:15,040
<i>you can kill.</i>

1040
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:20,644
<i>But he won't follow me.</i>

1041
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:32,168
<i> Thank you, Japheth.</i>

1042
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:35,322
<i>You take care of that baby.</i>

1043
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:47,408
<i>Don't be afraid, Mother.</i>

1044
01:47:48,440 --> 01:47:50,727
<i>We'll see each other
in the new world.</i>

1045
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:03,601
<i>Father.</i>

1046
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:16,091
<i> No! No!</i>

1047
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:18,121
<i>How could you?</i>

1048
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:25,362
<i>I thought you were good!</i>

1049
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:27,563
<i>I thought that's why He chose you.</i>

1050
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:30,086
<i>He chose me because
He knew I would complete the task,</i>

1051
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:31,401
<i>nothing more, son.</i>

1052
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:33,284
<i> Mother.</i>

1053
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:38,767
<i>Mother.</i>

1054
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:40,566
<i>It's your time.</i>

1055
01:48:43,480 --> 01:48:45,244
<i>Come. Come with me.</i>

1056
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:51,961
<i>You're all right.</i>

1057
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:53,445
<i>Japheth, stand back.</i>

1058
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:00,490
<i> Come now. Come inside.</i>

1059
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:05,249
<i>That's right.
That's right. Shh.</i>

1060
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:09,166
<i>You're all right, Ila.
You're safe here.</i>

1061
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:13,927
<i>Please keep it inside.</i>

1062
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:16,602
<i>Your baby's coming.</i>

1063
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,082
<i>Your baby's coming, Ila.</i>

1064
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:21,290
<i>Don't think about anything else.</i>

1065
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:00,721
<i>Father! Father, they're awake!</i>

1066
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:02,564
<i>They're awake!
They're eating each other!</i>

1067
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:05,569
<i>- The beasts.
- What?</i>

1068
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:07,200
<i>Come.</i>

1069
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:08,567
<i>Come!</i>

1070
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:11,531
<i>It's not possible for
them to have woken up</i>

1071
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:12,846
<i>without our help.</i>

1072
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,206
<i>Which way, son?</i>

1073
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:55,564
<i>That's right.
That's right.</i>

1074
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:11,731
<i>The line of Cain.</i>

1075
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:13,046
<i>I told you,</i>

1076
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:15,563
<i>I'm not afraid of miracles.</i>

1077
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:28,607
<i>That's right.</i>

1078
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:30,121
<i>That's right.</i>

1079
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:32,606
<i>A bit more.</i>

1080
01:51:57,640 --> 01:51:58,971
<i>
- Boy or girl?</i>

1081
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:01,761
<i>What's happening?</i>

1082
01:52:05,320 --> 01:52:06,526
<i>There's another.</i>

1083
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:07,807
<i>Two?</i>

1084
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,126
<i>Twins.</i>

1085
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:40,284
<i>Mother, so?</i>

1086
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:44,841
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1087
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:47,689
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1088
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:50,407
<i>Sisters.</i>

1089
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:51,721
<i>No.</i>

1090
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:54,487
<i>< No!</i>

1091
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:56,281
<i>No!</i>

1092
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,047
<i>No!</i>

1093
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:01,686
<i>He will not touch our daughters.</i>

1094
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:06,448
<i>No! Shem!</i>

1095
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:08,561
<i>Shem!</i>

1096
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:13,600
<i> I should have killed
you when I killed your father.</i>

1097
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:17,044
<i>Well, now we finish it.</i>

1098
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:18,647
<i>Now!</i>

1099
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:06,648
<i>The evils of mankind will
not live in this new Eden.</i>

1100
01:54:16,200 --> 01:54:18,202
<i>Leave us! Leave us alone!</i>

1101
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:21,045
<i> He's mine!</i>

1102
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:31,124
<i>The ark, the beasts, and all
of your women are now mine.</i>

1103
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:34,042
<i>I will build a new world</i>

1104
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:35,441
<i>in my image!</i>

1105
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:57,040
<i>Now you are a man.</i>

1106
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,843
<i>The Creator
has not forgotten us.</i>

1107
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:35,850
<i>Her name was Na'el.</i>

1108
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:41,285
<i>She was innocent.</i>

1109
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:47,044
<i>She was good.</i>

1110
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:03,770
<i>It's a boy.</i>

1111
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:05,361
<i>It's a boy.</i>

1112
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:07,091
<i>- It's a boy.
- Move away.</i>

1113
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:08,565
<i>It's a boy.</i>

1114
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:17,291
<i>Where is she?</i>

1115
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:20,606
<i>Where is she?</i>

1116
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:27,764
<i>No. No. No.</i>

1117
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:31,248
<i> You can't.</i>

1118
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:33,924
<i>They're beautiful.</i>

1119
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:36,966
<i>They?</i>

1120
01:56:38,160 --> 01:56:39,764
<i>You can't kill two.</i>

1121
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:41,922
<i>He sent us what we need.</i>

1122
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:44,767
<i>Oh, no. No. No!</i>

1123
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:47,250
<i>You can't!</i>

1124
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:49,810
<i>No!</i>

1125
01:56:50,240 --> 01:56:51,241
<i> Noah!</i>

1126
01:56:51,680 --> 01:56:52,841
<i>Ila!</i>

1127
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:02,201
<i>Noah. Please.</i>

1128
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:05,568
<i>These are my children!</i>

1129
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:07,961
<i>- Your grandchildren!
- I will not be stopped.</i>

1130
01:57:08,120 --> 01:57:10,521
<i>I know I cannot stop you,
but they're crying!</i>

1131
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:12,841
<i>Please don't let them die crying.</i>

1132
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:16,004
<i>Let me calm them.</i>

1133
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:20,047
<i>Please, just let them be at peace.</i>

1134
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:32,962
<i>The moon is high</i>

1135
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:36,041
<i>The leaves entwine</i>

1136
01:57:37,640 --> 01:57:41,167
<i>Your Father waits for thee</i>

1137
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:48,886
<i>To wrap you in
His sheltering wings</i>

1138
01:57:49,640 --> 01:57:53,565
<i>To whisper you to sleep</i>

1139
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,571
<i>To wrap you in</i>

1140
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:00,562
<i>His welcoming arms</i>

1141
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:05,765
<i>Till the night sky breaks</i>

1142
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:11,882
<i>Your Father is the healing wind</i>

1143
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:16,927
<i>That whispers you to sleep</i>

1144
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:22,365
<i>That whispers as</i>

1145
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:27,011
<i>You sleep</i>

1146
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:34,290
<i>You do not need to see this.</i>

1147
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:36,044
<i>I will hold them.</i>

1148
01:58:45,200 --> 01:58:46,804
<i>Do it quickly.</i>

1149
01:58:58,040 --> 01:58:59,644
<i>Do it quickly!</i>

1150
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:48,284
<i>I cannot do this.</i>

1151
02:00:04,280 --> 02:00:05,805
<i>< It's all right.</i>

1152
02:02:58,520 --> 02:03:00,284
<i> Hide your eyes, Japheth.</i>

1153
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,570
<i> Ham?
 He's here.</i>

1154
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:15,206
<i>You don't have to go.</i>

1155
02:04:18,720 --> 02:04:20,290
<i>I don't belong here.</i>

1156
02:04:22,360 --> 02:04:23,964
<i>For what it's worth,</i>

1157
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:27,491
<i>I'm glad that
it begins again with you.</i>

1158
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:35,201
<i>Maybe we'll learn to be kind.</i>

1159
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:20,445
<i>Will he come back?</i>

1160
02:05:24,920 --> 02:05:27,048
<i>Some things cannot be unbroken.</i>

1161
02:05:35,680 --> 02:05:37,284
<i>I have to know...</i>

1162
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:41,203
<i>Why did you spare them?</i>

1163
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:45,646
<i>I looked down
at those two little girls,</i>

1164
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:48,568
<i>and all I had in my heart
was love.</i>

1165
02:05:52,120 --> 02:05:53,565
<i>Then why are you alone, Noah?</i>

1166
02:05:55,360 --> 02:05:57,727
<i>Why are you separated
from your family?</i>

1167
02:05:59,640 --> 02:06:00,971
<i>Because I failed Him.</i>

1168
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:04,963
<i>And I failed all of you.</i>

1169
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:10,325
<i>Did you?</i>

1170
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:18,242
<i>He chose you for a reason, Noah.</i>

1171
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,480
<i>He showed you
the wickedness of man</i>

1172
02:06:21,680 --> 02:06:24,001
<i>and knew you would
not look away.</i>

1173
02:06:25,680 --> 02:06:27,887
<i>But then you saw goodness, too.</i>

1174
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:33,245
<i>The choice was put in your
hands because He put it there.</i>

1175
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:37,846
<i>He asked you to decide
if we were worth saving.</i>

1176
02:06:40,080 --> 02:06:43,004
<i>And you chose mercy.</i>

1177
02:06:46,360 --> 02:06:47,850
<i>You chose love.</i>

1178
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:55,290
<i>He has given us a second chance.</i>

1179
02:06:56,520 --> 02:06:58,249
<i>Be a father.</i>

1180
02:07:00,040 --> 02:07:02,042
<i>Be a grandfather.</i>

1181
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:06,407
<i>Help us to do better this time.</i>

1182
02:07:09,280 --> 02:07:11,203
<i>Help us start again.</i>

1183
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:22,851
<i>The Creator</i>

1184
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:25,842
<i>made Adam in His image,</i>

1185
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:28,362
<i>and placed the world
in his care.</i>

1186
02:09:29,360 --> 02:09:30,725
<i>That birthright</i>

1187
02:09:32,720 --> 02:09:34,370
<i>was passed down to us.</i>

1188
02:09:38,240 --> 02:09:42,689
<i>To my father, then to me,
and to my sons,</i>

1189
02:09:44,200 --> 02:09:45,247
<i>Shem,</i>

1190
02:09:49,280 --> 02:09:50,361
<i>Japheth,</i>

1191
02:09:54,040 --> 02:09:55,371
<i>and Ham.</i>

1192
02:10:03,360 --> 02:10:05,601
<i>That birthright
is now passed to you,</i>

1193
02:10:07,880 --> 02:10:09,041
<i>our grandchildren.</i>

1194
02:10:13,800 --> 02:10:15,609
<i>This will be your work,</i>

1195
02:10:19,080 --> 02:10:21,082
<i>and your responsibility.</i>

1196
02:10:21,560 --> 02:10:23,244
<i>So I say to you,</i>

1197
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:27,563
<i>be fruitful and multiply</i>

1198
02:10:29,565 --> 02:10:31,562
<i>and replenish the earth.</i>
