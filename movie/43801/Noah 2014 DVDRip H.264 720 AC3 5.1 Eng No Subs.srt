1
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,843
<i>From Adam to Seth,
from Seth to Enosh,</i>

2
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,444
Enosh to Kenan,
Kenan to Mahalalel

3
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,726
to my father, Methuselah,
then to me.

4
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,051
Today, that birthright
passes to you,

5
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,366
Noah.

6
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,484
My son.

7
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,735
The Creator made Adam
in His image,

8
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,331
and then placed
the world in his care.

9
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,683
This is your work now.
Your responsibility.

10
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,171
May you walk
alongside The Creator in righteousness.

11
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,130
So I say to you...

12
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,000
The Shrine of Seth!

13
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,925
Men.

14
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,531
Hide.

15
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,523
We mine here.

16
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,451
The ground is rich with tzohar.

17
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,164
This is The Creator's land.
What are you doing?

18
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,600
The Creator?

19
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,968
My mines run dry.

20
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,805
My city withers and must be fed.

21
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,883
And what has He done?

22
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,051
He cursed us to struggle

23
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,322
by the sweat of
our brow to survive!

24
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,135
Damned if I don't do
everything it takes

25
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,650
to do just that.

26
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,323
Damned if I don't take
what I want.

27
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,963
This relic belongs to
the descendants of Cain now.

28
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,929
The line of Seth ends here.

29
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,484
It is ours. Now dig!

30
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,407
Ham.

31
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,011
What are you doing?

32
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,010
It's pretty.

33
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,206
You see those other flowers?

34
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,565
How they're attached
to the ground?

35
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,764
That's where they should be.

36
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,609
They have a purpose.

37
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,081
They sprout.

38
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,046
And they bloom.

39
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,766
The wind takes their seeds
and more flowers grow.

40
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,921
We only collect
what we can use, and what we need.

41
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,886
Do you understand?

42
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,881
Shem.

43
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,761
Ham.

44
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,366
Let's go.

45
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,807
Men. Hide, hide.

46
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,201
Go.

47
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,320
You found our kill.

48
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,011
How fortunate.

49
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,646
But for you... maybe not.

50
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,126
You know how long it is
since we ate meat?

51
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,602
Since we even saw an animal?

52
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,961
Easy.

53
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,883
Please. What do you want?

54
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,366
Justice.

55
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,375
Why did they kill it?

56
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,526
They eat them.

57
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,051
Why?

58
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,210
They think it makes them stronger.

59
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,491
Is it true?

60
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,895
They forget

61
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,922
strength comes from The Creator.

62
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,765
Mama!

63
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,281
Mommy!

64
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,320
See your brothers?

65
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,891
Ham saw men hunting today.

66
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,444
They are getting closer.

67
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,561
How was he?

68
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,481
A little too interested.

69
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,840
Hmm.

70
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,445
He had to see it sometime.

71
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,764
I saw something else.

72
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,924
A flower

73
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,285
bloom from nothing.

74
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,685
Rest.

75
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,125
Perhaps He will finally
make things right.

76
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,491
Methuselah.

77
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,929
Did He speak to you?

78
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,330
I think so.

79
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,971
Will He help us?

80
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,328
He's going to destroy the world.

81
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,455
It's a long and dangerous
journey for the boys.

82
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,321
How do you know your
grandfather's still alive?

83
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,525
I don't.
I saw his mountain.

84
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,011
We need to go and find out
if he knows what we're to do.

85
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,441
Shem.
Can you help me with this?

86
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,286
We could take the boys
and find a place to hide.

87
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,450
There'll be no hiding.

88
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,044
We should have left already.

89
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,689
Ham, let me
show you how to do that.

90
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,255
Push it in here.

91
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,615
Next time we come through,

92
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,688
we'll know we've got certain
things we might need.

93
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,324
There are cities ahead.

94
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,642
We will not get too close.

95
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,055
Is that a tzohar mine?

96
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,082
It was once.
Before they dug it all up.

97
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,210
Should we go around?

98
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,681
No.

99
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,600
Do you think they're all dead?

100
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,121
It looks that way.

101
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,000
They must have
been scavenging here.

102
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,125
And someone scavenged from them.

103
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,600
Dada!

104
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,450
Stay close.

105
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,961
Father!

106
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,481
Here!

107
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,285
May I see?

108
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,327
Let me see.

109
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,450
Tell me your name.

110
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,215
You have a name?

111
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,321
Ila.

112
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,495
My name is Ila.

113
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,601
Ila.

114
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,325
You're going to be
all right, Ila.

115
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,486
This is Shem.

116
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,770
He's going to
hold your hand tight

117
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,325
and he won't let go.

118
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,802
Up the hill!
Hurry! Hurry!

119
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,888
We have to go. Now.

120
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,486
Up the hill. Run.

121
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,335
We can't go there.

122
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,171
We have no choice.
Hurry!

123
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,921
- Hold, men! Hold!
- The giants!

124
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,726
They'll kill you!

125
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,841
Shem!

126
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,728
Protect your mother,
first and last.

127
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,087
I love you.

128
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,761
Run!

129
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,049
Noah!

130
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,965
Noah!

131
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,255
Noah. Noah.
Are you all right?

132
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,483
We are to see Methuselah.
My grandfather.

133
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,081
A child of the old one?

134
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,082
You should have killed them.

135
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,611
- But, Samyaza...
- This is a man, Og.

136
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,645
Do you forget how
they betrayed The Creator?

137
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,845
It is He who sends us!

138
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,363
It lies!

139
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,806
Leave them here to rot.

140
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,521
What are they?

141
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,164
The Watchers.

142
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,365
Dada?

143
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,401
Sleep now.

144
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,244
Sing to me.

145
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,848
I want my daddy to sing to me.

146
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,215
You know, I, too, lost my father

147
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,810
when I was very young.

148
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,410
There's a song he used
to sing me sometimes

149
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,885
when I couldn't sleep.

150
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,050
Would you like to hear it?

151
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,321
<i>The moon is high</i>

152
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,887
<i>The trees entwine</i>

153
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,567
<i>Your Father waits for thee</i>

154
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,690
<i>To wrap you in
His sheltering wings</i>

155
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,768
<i>And whisper you to sleep</i>

156
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,124
<i>Your Father is</i>

157
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,409
<i>The healing wind</i>

158
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,726
<i>That whispers you to sleep</i>

159
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,367
<i>That whispers as you sleep</i>

160
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,445
It's an ugly wound.

161
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,925
She'll never have children.

162
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,810
If the fever doesn't take her,

163
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,646
I think she'll live.

164
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,930
Follow me.

165
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,167
I'm sorry I frightened you.

166
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,961
Watchers have learned
to fear men.

167
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,329
Then why
are you helping us?

168
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,641
The Creator formed us
on the second day.

169
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,843
The day He made the heavens.

170
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,280
We watched over Adam and Eve.

171
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,926
Saw their frailty and their love.

172
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,682
And then we saw their fall.
And we pitied them.

173
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,685
<i>We were not stone then,
but light.</i>

174
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,531
<i>It was not our place
to interfere.</i>

175
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,804
<i>Yet we chose to try
and help mankind.</i>

176
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,725
<i>And when we disobeyed
The Creator,</i>

177
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,729
<i>He punished us.</i>

178
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,964
<i>We were encrusted by your world.</i>

179
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,889
<i>Rock and mud
shackled our fiery glow.</i>

180
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,963
<i>Still, we taught mankind
all we knew of Creation.</i>

181
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,850
<i>With our help</i>

182
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,404
they rose from the dust,
became great and mighty.

183
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,531
But then they turned
our gifts to violence.

184
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,051
<i>Only one man protected us.</i>

185
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,295
<i>Your grandfather Methuselah.</i>

186
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,375
<i>We were hunted.
Most of us killed.</i>

187
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,766
<i>Those who lived
were left prisoners in these stony shells,</i>

188
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,851
<i>marooned upon this barren land.</i>

189
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,760
<i>We begged The Creator
to take us home.</i>

190
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,601
<i>But He was always silent.</i>

191
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,285
And now

192
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,085
you claim that you have
heard His call.

193
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,682
Samyaza cannot accept this.

194
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,415
A man?

195
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,284
When it is men
who broke the world.

196
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,728
But I look at you

197
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,765
and I see a glimmer
of Adam again.

198
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,930
The man I knew.

199
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,487
The man I came to help.

200
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,129
Why can't I come?

201
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,484
Because I need you
to look after Mother.

202
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,685
Do you understand?

203
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,360
And you
look after your father.

204
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,850
Watch over them.

205
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,004
They are in good hands.

206
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,880
Grandfather?

207
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,881
Noah.

208
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,689
This is your great-grandfather.

209
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,041
Show him respect.

210
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,571
Tell him your name.

211
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,406
I am Shem.

212
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,726
My eldest.

213
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,406
Come closer.

214
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,406
Let me see you.

215
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,646
You're a lucky boy.

216
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,441
I think you must have
your mother's looks,

217
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,925
not your father's.

218
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,209
Come tell me about yourself.

219
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,046
So,

220
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,771
what do you like
most in the world?

221
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,801
Berries.

222
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,295
- What?
- Berries.

223
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,845
Ah, berries, yes.

224
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,964
What can compete with
fresh, ripe berries? Nothing.

225
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,615
Yes, it's been so long
I can barely

226
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,449
remember the taste of them.

227
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,571
Ah, tell me,
did you bring me any?

228
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,926
No? Oh.

229
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,963
I'm craving them now.

230
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,162
Ah, well, perhaps one day.

231
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,615
You must be tired.
It's a long way up here.

232
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,801
Yeah.

233
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,287
Why not rest?

234
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,691
How perfect.

235
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,686
What we need to discuss
is not for boys.

236
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,761
You know why I've come?

237
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,606
Yes.

238
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,325
Before he walked on,

239
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,286
my father Enoch told me
that one day,

240
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,968
if man continued in his ways,

241
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,967
The Creator would
annihilate this world.

242
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,804
So what I saw is true?

243
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,326
All life blotted out
because of what man has done?

244
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,329
Can it not be averted?

245
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,801
Noah, you must trust
that He speaks in a way

246
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,121
that you can understand.

247
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,886
So you tell me.

248
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,163
Can this destruction be averted?

249
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,727
No.

250
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,166
Oh.

251
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,640
He sent me here.

252
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,681
Why send me if there's
nothing I can do to stop it?

253
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,566
Well, perhaps He simply sends
you here to share a cup of tea

254
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,205
with an old man.

255
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,375
So, is that all you saw?

256
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,085
The fires of destruction
on this place?

257
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,207
No, not fire.

258
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,406
Water.

259
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,055
Water? Huh.

260
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,175
My father said it would be fire.

261
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,885
I saw water.
Death by water.

262
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,525
I saw death.

263
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,843
And I saw new life.

264
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,563
There's something more, Grandfather.

265
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,409
Something I'm to do.

266
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,080
I know it.

267
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,129
I just didn't see what it was.

268
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,245
New life.

269
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,206
Well, perhaps there is
more for you to see.

270
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,921
Did He not send you here

271
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,202
to drink a cup of tea
with an old man?

272
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,082
The medicine always tastes bad.

273
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,166
She was
the only one moving.

274
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,520
Was she hurt badly?

275
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,615
She had
a big cut on her belly.

276
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,007
Mother helped
and I held her hand.

277
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,847
That must have
made her feel safe.

278
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,527
Well?

279
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,325
Fire consumes all.

280
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,844
Water cleanses.

281
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,282
It separates the foul
from the pure.

282
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,369
The wicked from the innocent.

283
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,282
And that which sinks
from that which rises.

284
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,371
He destroys all,

285
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,003
but only to start again.

286
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,847
You sure?

287
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,161
Yes.

288
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,802
The storm cannot be stopped.

289
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,889
But it can be survived.

290
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,240
Yeah.

291
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,929
You may need this.

292
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,486
It's a seed.

293
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,729
From the first Garden.

294
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,205
From Eden.

295
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,770
Remember, Noah,

296
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,567
He chose you for a reason.

297
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,206
Oh...

298
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,370
You can't get me!

299
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,727
Oh, you can't get me!

300
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,206
Dada!

301
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,246
My grandfather lives.

302
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,042
He's helped me see
what we're here to do.

303
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,250
Men are going to be punished

304
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,760
for what they've done
to this world.

305
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,410
There will be destruction.

306
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,930
There will be tragedy.

307
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,046
And our family has been
chosen for a great task.

308
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,889
We've been chosen
to save the innocent.

309
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,926
The innocent?

310
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,566
The animals.

311
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,926
Why are they innocent?

312
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,281
Because they still live
as they did in the Garden.

313
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,647
Yes.

314
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,444
And we need to save enough
of them to start again.

315
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,926
But what of us?

316
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,082
I guess we get
to start again, too.

317
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,324
We get to start again
in a new and better world.

318
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,851
But first

319
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,167
we have to build.

320
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,126
Build what?

321
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,443
A great flood is coming.

322
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,775
The waters of the heavens

323
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,211
will meet the waters
of the earth.

324
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,601
We build a vessel
to survive the storm.

325
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,325
We build an ark.

326
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,369
Take the traitor back.

327
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,007
He is a child
of the old one!

328
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,686
Stop!

329
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,411
There is work to do.
Help us.

330
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,366
Help you?

331
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,251
We tried to help your kind once.

332
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,370
And we lost everything
because of you!

333
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,924
Not everything.

334
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,846
We can save what is left.
We can serve Him again.

335
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,568
You treacherous snake!

336
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,209
The Creator.

337
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,285
Children!

338
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,801
What is this?

339
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,806
This...

340
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,524
This is our ark.

341
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,330
We will help this man.

342
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,325
No!

343
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,566
Shem.

344
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,766
Wait.

345
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,646
Please.

346
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,605
It still hurts?

347
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,004
- Ham!
- Shem!

348
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,284
He doesn't have anyone.

349
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,846
Come.

350
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,569
Father, did you see them?

351
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,526
Father?

352
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,371
Yes, Japheth.

353
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,571
It begins.

354
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,120
Ready?

355
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,964
It sleeps.

356
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,800
Gently.

357
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,886
See, that's a boy one
and that's a girl one.

358
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,335
After the storm,

359
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,850
they'll become a mother
and a father.

360
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,846
And the hatchlings will spread
right across the world.

361
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,526
We have to be gentle with them
and we have to be protective.

362
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,455
If something were to happen,

363
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,006
that would be a small piece
of Creation lost forever.

364
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,495
All of these innocent creatures

365
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,681
are now in our care.

366
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,047
It's our job to look after them.

367
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,205
Father?

368
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,605
All the birds are two.

369
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,401
You have Mother, Shem has Ila.

370
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,890
But what of me?

371
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,886
What of Japheth?

372
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,085
Who is there for us?

373
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,405
Did you see how He made the forest

374
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,090
to give us wood for the ark?

375
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,449
How He sent the birds?

376
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,561
So,

377
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,249
hasn't He sent
everything we need?

378
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,126
Mother!

379
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,255
What is it? What?

380
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,611
Snakes!

381
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,449
- Snakes are coming, too?
- Yeah.

382
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,969
All that creeps,
all that crawls,

383
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,446
all that slithers.

384
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,165
It's all right.

385
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,322
Father! Father!

386
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,329
Don't be afraid.

387
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,202
No one will hurt this boy.

388
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,361
What's your name?

389
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,166
- Ham.
- Ham?

390
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,886
Oh.

391
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,524
I am Tubal-Cain.

392
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,564
Do you know me?

393
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,850
You don't know your king?

394
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,895
My father says
there can be no king

395
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,570
in The Creator's garden.

396
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,246
Hmm.

397
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,488
Ham, come here.

398
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,128
Do not take my best soldier.

399
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,415
He's nothing of yours.

400
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,442
Look at his hand on that weapon.

401
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,130
I believe he is
something of mine.

402
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,167
Ham.

403
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,926
Leave it.

404
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,095
No, he gave it to me.

405
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,281
Do what I tell you.

406
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,649
When I heard
talk of miracles, I dismissed them.

407
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,887
But then I saw the birds
with my own eyes, flying here,

408
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,286
and I had to come.

409
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,366
There isn't anything
for you here.

410
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,527
No?

411
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,162
This all belongs to me.

412
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,841
This land. This forest.

413
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,842
That stronghold of yours.

414
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,330
Did you really think
you could protect yourself

415
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,811
from me in that?

416
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,884
It's not protection from you.

417
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,845
Then what is it?

418
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,646
An ark

419
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,844
to hold the innocent
when The Creator sends

420
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,202
his deluge to wipe out
the wicked from this world.

421
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,655
The Creator does not care
what happens in this world.

422
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,081
Nobody has heard from Him
since He marked Cain.

423
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,851
We are alone.
Orphaned children,

424
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,684
cursed to struggle by the sweat
of our brow to survive.

425
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,375
Damned if I don't do everything

426
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,767
it takes to
do just that.

427
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,362
Damned if I don't
take what I want.

428
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,770
We have met?

429
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,280
I am the son of Lamech!

430
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,848
8 generations
descended from Seth!

431
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,930
Return to your cities of Cain!

432
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,728
Know we have all been judged!

433
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,735
I have men at my back,

434
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,842
and you stand alone and defy me?

435
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,241
I'm not alone.

436
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,046
Take the children!

437
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,810
Do not fear, my people!

438
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,615
Don't be afraid! Stand!

439
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,085
Hold your line, men.

440
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,605
His minions, uh,
they're with you?

441
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,601
Hmm.

442
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,809
Miracles?
A deluge, you claim?

443
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,009
Well, perhaps you're right.

444
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,681
Perhaps casting us out
of Paradise was not enough.

445
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,961
Perhaps,

446
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,001
He returns to finish us off.

447
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,805
Well, if He does,

448
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,284
I will ride the storm
in that ship of yours.

449
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,082
There is no escape
for you and your kind.

450
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,764
Your time is done.

451
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,295
- The land is dying.
- Ham.

452
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,600
The cities are dead.

453
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,484
Don't listen to him.

454
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,650
My people follow me!

455
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,647
And more will follow them!

456
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,846
I'm not afraid of miracles,
son of Lamech!

457
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,169
If you refuse my dozens now,

458
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,331
I shall return with legions!

459
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,681
Move.

460
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,571
Father?

461
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,050
Will so many really come?

462
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,525
We need to finish
as fast as we can.

463
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,203
The sooner He sends
the rain, the better.

464
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,525
Until then, we're safer inside.

465
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,045
We build.

466
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,881
First weapons, then men.

467
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,607
Feed only those that will fight.

468
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,046
Arm them,

469
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,855
train them,

470
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,406
and there is nothing
they can't do.

471
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,891
With an army,

472
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,685
we can crush those giants.

473
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,730
Please, we're hungry!

474
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,615
- Give us meat.
- Our children are starving.

475
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,815
Please help us!

476
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,685
Let us go!

477
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,969
We're starving!

478
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,200
Should I come back?

479
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,361
No.

480
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,882
Do you think those men
are going to attack us?

481
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,521
When the rain comes.

482
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,045
What do you think it'll be like?

483
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,245
I've imagined it.

484
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,404
Seeing that much death,

485
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:32,091
I'm not sure there are words.

486
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,006
The end of everything.

487
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,766
The beginning.

488
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,050
The beginning of everything.

489
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,160
So what is it?

490
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,242
Whatever he's done or said,
Shem is very fond of you.

491
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,083
Shem needs a woman.

492
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,845
A real woman.

493
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,290
He should have a family.

494
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,285
I can't give any of that to him.

495
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,806
And I'm not going to
deny him those things,

496
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,963
even if he wants me to.

497
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,605
I won't do it.

498
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,121
Besides,

499
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,450
why would The Creator want
a barren girl on His ark?

500
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,289
Ila. Ila.

501
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,963
When we first took you in,

502
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,442
I thought you were
going to be a burden.

503
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,327
And I didn't want to see

504
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,647
anybody else ruined by this world.

505
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,724
But I was wrong.

506
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:49,966
You're a gift.

507
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,971
A precious, precious gift.

508
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,451
Just don't forget
how precious a gift you are.

509
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,961
I know you'll be going to find
wives for Ham and Japheth.

510
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,295
You should find one
for Shem, too.

511
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,685
Ila.

512
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,935
Where do
you think you're going?

513
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,480
Please, please
don't take my baby!

514
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,722
Let them go! Please!

515
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,015
Sorry, we have to eat!

516
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,247
Don't take my baby!
No!

517
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,086
Don't take my baby! No, no,
please will you stop him?

518
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,084
Let them go!

519
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,927
No!

520
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,083
Quit struggling!
It'll be easier.

521
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,928
Come with me! Stop struggling!

522
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,008
You! You!

523
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:59,126
I have two girls!
I have two girls to trade!

524
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,129
Take the girls!
Give me the meat!

525
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,930
Give it to me!

526
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,721
What happened?

527
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,015
All of this
should be inside by now.

528
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,175
The storm is coming.

529
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,535
What about our wives?
Where are they?

530
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,855
Did you not hear
what I just said?

531
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,006
But when are they coming?

532
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,046
There will be no wives.

533
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,535
What? What? No!

534
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,760
You said that The Creator
would give us what we'll need.

535
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,805
- Help your brother.
- No.

536
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,695
Listen, you can't do this!

537
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,484
You can't. How am I
supposed to be a man?

538
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,730
I said help your brother.

539
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,402
- You want me to stay a child!
- No!

540
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:20,486
I'm asking you to be a man
and do what needs to be done.

541
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,446
Ham!

542
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,921
Ham!

543
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,565
What are you doing, Noah?

544
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,129
The wickedness
is not just in them.

545
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,405
It's in all of us.

546
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,286
I saw it.

547
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,695
No.

548
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:09,801
Noah.

549
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,804
There's goodness in us.

550
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,449
Look at our boys.

551
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:18,246
Shem's loyalty.
Japheth's kindness.

552
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,327
Ham's integrity. Hmm?

553
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,326
Good men.

554
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,162
They'd be good fathers.

555
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,323
Shem is blinded by desire.

556
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,289
Ham is covetous.

557
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,607
And Japheth
lives only to please.

558
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,001
I am no better.

559
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,566
And you?

560
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,561
Is there anything
you would not do,

561
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,967
good or bad,
for those three boys?

562
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,322
We would both choose to kill

563
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,135
in order to protect our children.

564
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,286
Yes.

565
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,851
We're no different.

566
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:54,935
We were weak and we were selfish

567
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,450
to think we could
set ourselves apart.

568
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,685
We will work,

569
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,009
complete the task,

570
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,691
and then we'll die.

571
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,762
The same as everyone else.

572
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:11,685
They are children!

573
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,207
They are our children, Noah!

574
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,363
Have you no mercy?

575
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,882
The time for mercy has passed.

576
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,049
Now our punishment begins.

577
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:58,721
Ham!

578
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:04,767
Ham!

579
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,045
Grandfather?

580
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,125
Grandfather?

581
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,607
Did you bring me something?

582
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,442
Did Noah plant
the seed I gave him?

583
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,601
Yes.

584
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:39,927
Mmm.

585
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,046
And in all that forest
there were no berries?

586
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,602
Shem promised me berries.

587
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,731
Oh.

588
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,041
I'm sorry.

589
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,415
I didn't know.

590
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,601
Huh.

591
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,200
It's a pity.

592
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,722
Then why did you come here?

593
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,966
It's Noah.

594
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,402
He leaves our boys with no one.

595
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,642
Shem has Ila, but she's barren.

596
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:12,322
There'll be no other wives, so

597
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:14,000
no children.

598
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,481
Justice.

599
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:21,295
The Creator destroys this world

600
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,481
because we corrupted it.

601
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,005
So we ourselves
must be destroyed.

602
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,241
No.

603
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:30,001
I can't believe that's true.

604
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,324
Not when I look at my sons.

605
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,288
All they desire is love.

606
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:38,450
Isn't that all their hearts
need to be good?

607
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,007
Who is good?
Who is wicked?

608
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:43,447
How am I supposed to know
what is right?

609
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,448
That choice is Noah's.
Not mine. Not yours.

610
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,682
It sounds like he has made it.

611
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,524
So then you will not help me?

612
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,329
I don't know if I even could.

613
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:03,211
But if I tried,
it could cause pain and possibly tragedy.

614
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:07,327
And in the end,
it would just come back to Noah again.

615
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,360
Is that what you wish?

616
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:15,015
I want my sons to have children.

617
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,326
I want them to be happy.

618
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,484
I can't bear to think of them dying alone.

619
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,370
Out of the way!
Coming through!

620
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,085
Whoa!

621
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,931
Please!

622
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,401
Get away!

623
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,206
No. No, no...

624
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:03,249
It's all right.
It's all right. I'm not...

625
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,606
I'm not going to hurt you.

626
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,888
I have food.

627
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,085
Here.

628
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,406
What do you want?

629
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,205
Nothing.

630
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,885
Are you alone?

631
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:53,561
Yes.

632
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,486
And you?

633
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,683
I can help you get away.

634
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,841
No.

635
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,242
Well, then,
I'll stay a little while.

636
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,524
If that is all right?

637
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,206
My name

638
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,611
is Na'el.

639
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,041
Shem!

640
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,324
Go and find them
and bring them back.

641
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,207
Be careful.

642
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,405
Ham?

643
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,041
Don't be afraid, granddaughter.

644
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,370
Don't be afraid.

645
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,001
Grandfather?

646
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,241
Yes.

647
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,895
What are you doing down here?

648
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,922
I'm looking for berries.
I have a craving.

649
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,215
Come and help me look for them.

650
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,083
My eyes aren't as good
as they used to be.

651
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:43,401
I have to find Ham.

652
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:44,720
There's time enough for that.

653
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,366
Come here.

654
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,405
Come.

655
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,684
Come here and help me.

656
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,603
They're here somewhere.

657
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,922
They're here somewhere, berries.

658
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,815
I know there are berries.

659
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,729
There's nothing here,
Grandfather.

660
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,443
- Let me take you to Noah.
- No.

661
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:06,285
No need for that.
You go now.

662
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,091
You go.

663
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,524
Oh, wait. Wait.

664
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,495
10 years you've been
with my own.

665
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,601
With my own family.

666
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:20,564
10 years.
And you love them?

667
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,802
Shem? And Noah?

668
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,085
He saved my life.

669
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,970
Raised me.

670
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,805
Yes, he did.

671
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,280
Yes.

672
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,602
And you are now
as his own daughter.

673
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,440
My own great-granddaughter.

674
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:46,325
10 years in the shadow
of my home,

675
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,485
and yet I have never
given you my blessing.

676
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,481
May I?

677
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,841
Ham! Ila!

678
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,840
You can go now. Go to him.

679
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,683
You go. Go now.

680
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:31,486
Ila!

681
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,166
Ila!

682
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:41,486
Ila!

683
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,290
We have to get back...

684
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:05,611
We have to go.

685
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:08,811
We have to go.
Come on. Now!

686
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,604
I am a man.

687
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,643
Made in Your image.

688
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,775
Why will You
not converse with me?

689
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,324
I give life.

690
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:52,481
I take life away.
As You do!

691
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,844
And I am like You, am I not?

692
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:00,975
Speak to me.

693
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,770
Speak to me!

694
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,849
It has begun!

695
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:23,841
Death comes from the heavens!

696
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,600
This rain

697
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:29,010
is meant to wash us off
the face of this world.

698
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,329
But we are men.

699
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:36,568
We decide if we live or die.

700
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,855
We are men!

701
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:42,804
And men united are invincible!

702
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,570
Do you want to live?

703
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,240
Yeah!

704
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:50,044
We kill the giants!

705
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,731
We kill Noah!

706
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,890
We take the ark!

707
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,401
Yeah!

708
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,721
Noah!

709
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,206
Where's Ham?

710
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,920
Get it off me, no! Ow!

711
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,724
No, no, no!

712
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,615
We have to get away!

713
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:59,449
I won't leave you. I won't!

714
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:02,641
Ham!

715
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,802
Father, help! Help!

716
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:09,963
- Help her!
- Help me, please!

717
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:12,560
Please, help me, please!

718
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,041
Please...
Someone please help me!

719
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,131
Help me!

720
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,084
No!

721
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,322
Ham! Ham!

722
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,165
Ham!

723
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,321
Ham!

724
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,850
Ham!

725
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,805
Ham!

726
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:56,966
Ham!

727
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,889
Samyaza!

728
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,048
Samyaza! Samyaza!

729
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,049
- Noah!
- Where is Ham?

730
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,203
Ham is through! Quickly!

731
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,166
Run!

732
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,406
Ham.

733
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:38,401
Ham!

734
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:52,411
Faster!

735
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:56,891
Forward!

736
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,322
Protect your mother.
Protect them all.

737
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,925
Part!

738
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:56,965
My Creator,

739
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,850
forgive me.

740
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:13,524
The Creator brings him home.

741
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:39,841
Ham?

742
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,126
Ham?

743
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,009
Shem. Shem, go inside.

744
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,126
Go inside.

745
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,280
They are upon us. Go inside!

746
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,482
Good-bye, son of Adam.

747
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:41,690
Son, where are you?

748
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,535
Ham!

749
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:48,881
Ham?

750
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:54,731
Ham?

751
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:56,601
It's all right.

752
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,495
- Shem!
- Father!

753
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,295
Japheth,
where are you?

754
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,455
- Ila, I'm here!
- Father!

755
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:35,687
Mother, where's Father?

756
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,849
Please, Noah,

757
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,407
there must be
something we can do.

758
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:54,008
We can drag ropes.

759
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,566
They cannot all be soldiers, Father.

760
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:01,409
They are just people.
And there's room.

761
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:03,888
There is no room for them.

762
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:55,162
Soon everything
we knew will be gone.

763
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,970
All that is left of Creation
will lie within these walls.

764
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:03,646
Outside,

765
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,647
just the waters of chaos again.

766
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:11,005
You are angry.

767
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,810
You judge me.

768
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:17,810
Let me tell you a story.

769
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:20,935
The first story
my father told me,

770
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,770
and the first story
that I told each of you.

771
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:33,804
In the beginning,

772
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,166
there was nothing.

773
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:41,489
<i>Nothing but the silence
of an infinite darkness.</i>

774
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,208
<i>But the breath of The Creator
fluttered against</i>

775
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:45,885
<i>the face of the void,
whispering,</i>

776
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,050
<i>"Let there be light."</i>

777
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,011
<i>And light was.</i>

778
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,846
<i>And it was good.</i>

779
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,731
<i>The first day.</i>

780
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:56,688
<i>And then the formless light</i>

781
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,371
<i>began to take on
substance and shape.</i>

782
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,210
<i>A second day.</i>

783
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,244
<i>And our world was born.</i>

784
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:06,167
<i>Our beautiful, fragile home.</i>

785
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:09,245
<i>And a great, warming light
nurtured its days.</i>

786
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:13,161
<i>And a lesser light
ruled the nights.</i>

787
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:16,644
<i>And there was evening.
And morning.</i>

788
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:18,685
<i>Another day.</i>

789
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:23,881
<i>And the waters of the world
gathered together,</i>

790
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:27,603
<i>and in their midst
emerged dry land.</i>

791
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,604
<i>Another day passed.</i>

792
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:33,720
<i>And the ground put forth
the growing things.</i>

793
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:35,015
<i>A thick blanket of green</i>

794
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,008
<i>stretching across all Creation.</i>

795
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:40,850
<i>And the waters, too,
teemed with life.</i>

796
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:43,881
<i>Great creatures of the deep
that are no more.</i>

797
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,043
<i>Vast multitudes of fish,</i>

798
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:49,363
<i>some of which may still
swim beneath these seas.</i>

799
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:53,606
<i>And soon the sky
was streaming with birds.</i>

800
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:55,086
<i>And there was evening.</i>

801
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:57,965
<i>And there was morning.
A 5th day.</i>

802
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:00,924
<i>Now the whole world
was full of living beings.</i>

803
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,601
<i>Everything that creeps,
everything that crawls,</i>

804
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,603
<i>and every beast
that walks upon the ground.</i>

805
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,127
<i>And it was good.
It was all good.</i>

806
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,735
<i>There was light
and air and water</i>

807
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:13,127
<i>and soil,
all clean and unspoiled.</i>

808
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,967
<i>There were plants and fish
and fowl and beast,</i>

809
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:17,645
<i>each after their own kind.</i>

810
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,240
<i>All part of the greater whole.
All in their place.</i>

811
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:23,564
<i>And all was in balance.
It was paradise.</i>

812
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,888
<i>A jewel in The Creator's palm.</i>

813
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:31,801
<i>Then The Creator made Man.
And by his side, Woman.</i>

814
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,284
<i>Father and mother of us all.</i>

815
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:37,960
<i>He gave them a choice.</i>

816
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:42,968
<i>Follow the temptation
of darkness</i>

817
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:46,850
<i>or hold on to the
blessing of light.</i>

818
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,168
<i>But they ate from
the forbidden fruit.</i>

819
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:02,642
<i>Their innocence
was extinguished.</i>

820
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:06,324
<i>And so for the 10 generations
since Adam, sin</i>

821
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:08,649
<i>has walked within us.</i>

822
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:12,969
<i>Brother against brother.</i>

823
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:16,648
<i>Nation against nation.</i>

824
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:19,209
<i>Man against Creation.</i>

825
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:23,009
<i>We murdered each other.</i>

826
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:28,131
<i>We broke the world.
We did this.</i>

827
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:30,329
<i>Man did this.</i>

828
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:33,162
<i>Everything that was beautiful,</i>

829
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,323
<i>everything that was good,</i>

830
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,365
<i>we shattered.</i>

831
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,206
<i>Now,</i>

832
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:42,889
<i>it begins again.</i>

833
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,723
Air, water, earth, plant,
fish, bird and beast.

834
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,249
Paradise returns.

835
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,885
But this time,

836
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:57,004
this time there will be no men.

837
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,207
If we were to enter
the Garden again,

838
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:03,041
it would only be
to destroy it once more.

839
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:04,521
No.

840
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,082
The Creator has judged us.

841
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:11,763
Mankind must end.

842
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,241
Shem and Ila,

843
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:18,524
you will bury your mother and I.

844
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,731
Ham, you will bury them.

845
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:25,761
Japheth will lay you to rest.

846
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:28,570
You, Japheth,

847
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,762
you will be the last man.

848
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:35,404
And in time you, too,
will return to the dust.

849
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:37,922
Creation will be left alone,

850
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:40,282
safe and beautiful.

851
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:46,083
I'm very sorry about that girl.

852
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,204
And I'm sorry for you.

853
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:52,415
But we have been entrusted with a task

854
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:54,761
much greater than our own desires.

855
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,769
Ham.

856
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:43,966
Shh.

857
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:45,527
Noah...

858
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:48,369
Does he know I'm here?

859
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,368
- Does he know I'm here?
- No, no, no. No.

860
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:00,688
Why are you helping me?

861
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:06,764
There was a girl.

862
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,525
I tried to bring her.

863
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,482
But he just let her die.

864
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:17,041
Ah.

865
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:21,722
And now you want revenge.

866
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:25,887
No.

867
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:27,890
Yes, you do.

868
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,209
Yes, you do.

869
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:57,489
There's no more land.

870
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,202
Everything out there
must be dead.

871
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:11,570
It had to be what He wanted.

872
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:14,923
A world without man.

873
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:22,446
You see that, don't you?

874
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:30,531
What I see

875
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:34,921
is how hard this was
for you to do

876
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:38,882
as a man who respects life,

877
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,604
a man who loves his children.

878
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,284
You've been strong.

879
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:53,770
But it's done.

880
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:57,290
It's done now.

881
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,728
And you can put
that burden down.

882
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:07,005
Noah.

883
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:20,246
It's all right.

884
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:30,295
If your father found me,

885
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:31,651
he would kill me.

886
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:36,124
We must be ready,
but I am too weak.

887
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:42,205
Mmm.

888
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:50,646
What are you doing?

889
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,683
I must get my strength back.

890
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,321
The beasts are precious.
There are only two of each.

891
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:58,522
And there is only one of me.

892
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,126
But the rain,

893
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,169
all these miracles,
are for them.

894
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:03,887
Them?

895
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:08,011
Your father fills
a ship with beasts while children drown.

896
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:11,326
He belittles you by telling you,
you must serve them.

897
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:12,960
Oh, no.

898
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:15,400
They serve us.

899
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,522
That is the greatness of men.

900
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:25,206
When The Creator
finished making the sky,

901
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:27,886
the ground, the sea,
and this beast,

902
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,690
He wasn't satisfied.

903
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:33,686
He needed something greater.
Something

904
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:37,727
to take dominion over it
and subdue it.

905
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:40,161
Mmm.

906
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:42,842
So He made us in His image.

907
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:44,526
Us.

908
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,082
This is your world, Ham.

909
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:56,446
Seize it.

910
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:13,406
Ila.

911
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:46,564
Oh, Grandfather.

912
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,806
What is it?

913
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:00,403
You're not sick.

914
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:05,322
But that's impossible.

915
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:19,920
What?

916
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:21,491
What is it?

917
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:24,167
Noah.

918
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:28,931
It is his grandchild.

919
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:48,851
What's wrong?

920
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:51,525
- Father.
- Noah.

921
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,527
We've come to ask
for your blessing.

922
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:00,164
I don't understand.

923
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:02,960
I am with Child.

924
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:11,645
It's not possible.

925
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:15,006
You're barren.

926
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:18,241
You can't conceive. How...

927
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:20,249
- How is that possible?
- Grandfather.

928
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:25,241
- I asked Grandfather...
- To what?

929
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:26,890
Undermine The Creator?

930
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:29,162
To give our children a future.

931
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:31,051
To give humanity a future.

932
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,761
Have you any idea
what you've done?

933
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:37,323
All those lives!
All those people!

934
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:39,086
For nothing!

935
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,321
Do you know what
this forces me to do?

936
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,121
No!

937
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,488
Please! Please!

938
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,251
Please!

939
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:25,449
I cannot do this!

940
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:27,802
Tell me I don't need to do this!

941
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:29,571
Please.

942
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:34,646
Have I not done everything
that You asked of me?

943
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:36,729
Is that not enough?

944
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:41,487
Why do You not answer me?

945
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:44,446
Why?

946
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:05,489
I will not fail You.

947
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:08,649
I will not fail You.

948
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:12,524
I will not fail You.

949
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:18,450
It shall be done.

950
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,564
It shall be done.

951
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:00,366
Father?

952
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:10,091
The rains have stopped.

953
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:13,847
The Creator smiles on our child.

954
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:18,050
The rains have stopped
because of your child, yes,

955
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:20,690
but He does not smile.

956
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:25,323
If your child is a boy,

957
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:29,521
he will replace Japheth,
last man.

958
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:36,046
If it is a girl,

959
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:39,522
who could mature into a mother,

960
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:44,211
she must die.

961
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:50,725
Are you mad?

962
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:53,131
That is my Child!

963
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:03,923
If you should bear a girl,

964
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:08,607
in the moment of her birth,
I will cut her down.

965
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:57,968
Mother!

966
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:00,085
Mother, my bird!

967
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:15,849
Nothing. No mud.

968
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:31,686
Nothing.

969
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:35,130
We still have to go.

970
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:37,801
Ila.

971
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:39,686
There's nothing.

972
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:42,569
There's nothing out there.

973
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:46,249
You have food and water
for how long? Weeks?

974
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,650
- A month?
- A month.

975
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:56,486
Please wait.

976
01:41:57,720 --> 01:42:00,200
Wait until the bird finds land.
Please.

977
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:02,641
Japheth, send him again.

978
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:04,320
- He's too tired.
- Then wake another.

979
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:06,725
Here.

980
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:10,251
Please. One that can find us a home.

981
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:21,881
No.

982
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:28,570
We leave today.

983
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:54,124
They will die out there.

984
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:57,285
Not if they stay.

985
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:01,046
And let you kill their child?

986
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:07,251
Noah.

987
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:09,926
Noah!

988
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:12,884
I did this.

989
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:16,446
I did this, Noah!

990
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:18,441
Please!

991
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:20,930
Punish me!

992
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:24,286
Punish me, Noah!

993
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:27,005
Not them.

994
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:30,129
Not the child.

995
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:32,851
Please.

996
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:36,242
The child is not being punished.

997
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:38,921
We are all being punished.

998
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:41,451
All of us.

999
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:45,762
It's not something I want to do.

1000
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:51,809
It's something I have to do.

1001
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:00,686
It is painful,

1002
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,040
but it is just.

1003
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:09,486
Just?

1004
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:12,720
How?

1005
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:17,290
How is this just?

1006
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:21,168
It's a baby, Noah.

1007
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:27,731
If you hold to this,

1008
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:31,845
you will lose your sons,
you will lose Ila,

1009
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:34,244
you will lose me.

1010
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:42,522
I love you, Noah.

1011
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:47,050
And I have
followed you everywhere.

1012
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:48,525
Through everything.

1013
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:50,730
I forgave you.

1014
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:54,164
When everyone was dead,
I forgave you.

1015
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:56,891
I was ready to die with you.

1016
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,331
But this

1017
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:02,242
I will never forgive.

1018
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:05,404
Boy or girl,
I will never forgive!

1019
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:08,889
And you will die alone!
Not just alone, but hated!

1020
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:12,210
Hated by everyone you love!

1021
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:15,249
That is just!

1022
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:19,050
That is just.

1023
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:44,931
Oh...

1024
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:49,406
Oh.

1025
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:52,401
It's time.

1026
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:14,246
Bring him through there.

1027
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:17,330
One blow will finish it.

1028
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:25,490
Just in case, huh?

1029
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:32,483
I don't know if I can.

1030
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:40,130
He killed your woman.

1031
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:42,766
And now he plots to kill
your brother's firstborn.

1032
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:44,649
Is that what you want?

1033
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:48,125
You want your sister
to die on the seas?

1034
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:52,327
A man isn't ruled by the heavens.

1035
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:54,608
A man is ruled by his will.

1036
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:56,605
So I ask you,

1037
01:46:57,320 --> 01:46:58,731
are you a man?

1038
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:10,371
Good.

1039
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:12,682
Because if you're a man,

1040
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:15,040
you can kill.

1041
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:20,644
But he won't follow me.

1042
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:32,168
Thank you, Japheth.

1043
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:35,322
You take care of that baby.

1044
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:47,408
Don't be afraid, Mother.

1045
01:47:48,440 --> 01:47:50,727
We'll see each other
in the new world.

1046
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:03,601
Father.

1047
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:16,091
No! No!

1048
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:18,121
How could you?

1049
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:25,362
I thought you were good!

1050
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:27,615
I thought that's why He chose you.

1051
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:30,086
He chose me because
He knew I would complete the task,

1052
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:31,401
nothing more, son.

1053
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:33,284
Mother.

1054
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:38,767
Mother.

1055
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:40,615
It's your time.

1056
01:48:43,480 --> 01:48:45,244
Come. Come with me.

1057
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:51,961
You're all right.

1058
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:53,445
Japheth, stand back.

1059
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:00,490
Come now. Come inside.

1060
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:05,295
That's right.
That's right. Shh.

1061
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:09,166
You're all right, Ila.
You're safe here.

1062
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:13,927
Please keep it inside.

1063
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:16,602
Your baby's coming.

1064
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,082
Your baby's coming, Ila.

1065
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:21,335
Don't think about anything else.

1066
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:00,721
Father! Father, they're awake!

1067
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:02,564
They're awake!
They're eating each other!

1068
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:05,569
- The beasts.
- What?

1069
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:07,200
Come.

1070
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:08,567
Come!

1071
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:11,531
It's not possible for
them to have woken up

1072
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:12,846
without our help.

1073
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,206
Which way, son?

1074
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:55,564
That's right.
That's right.

1075
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:11,731
The line of Cain.

1076
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:13,046
I told you,

1077
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:15,563
I'm not afraid of miracles.

1078
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:28,607
That's right.

1079
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:30,121
That's right.

1080
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:32,606
A bit more.

1081
01:51:57,640 --> 01:51:58,971
Boy or girl?

1082
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:01,761
What's happening?

1083
01:52:05,320 --> 01:52:06,526
There's another.

1084
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:07,807
Two?

1085
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,126
Twins.

1086
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:40,284
Mother, so?

1087
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:44,841
I'm sorry.

1088
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:47,689
I'm so sorry.

1089
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:50,407
Sisters.

1090
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:51,721
No.

1091
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:54,487
No!

1092
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:56,335
No!

1093
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,047
No!

1094
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:01,686
He will not touch our daughters.

1095
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:06,448
No! Shem!

1096
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:08,561
Shem!

1097
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:13,600
I should have killed
you when I killed your father.

1098
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:17,044
Well, now we finish it.

1099
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:18,647
Now!

1100
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:06,648
The evils of mankind will
not live in this new Eden.

1101
01:54:16,200 --> 01:54:18,202
Leave us! Leave us alone!

1102
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:21,045
He's mine!

1103
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:31,124
The ark, the beasts, and all
of your women are now mine.

1104
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:34,042
I will build a new world

1105
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:35,441
in my image!

1106
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:57,040
Now you are a man.

1107
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,843
The Creator
has not forgotten us.

1108
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:35,850
Her name was Na'el.

1109
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:41,285
She was innocent.

1110
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:47,044
She was good.

1111
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:03,770
It's a boy.

1112
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:05,361
It's a boy.

1113
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:07,091
- It's a boy.
- Move away.

1114
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:08,565
It's a boy.

1115
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:17,291
Where is she?

1116
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:20,606
Where is she?

1117
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:27,764
No. No. No.

1118
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:31,248
You can't.

1119
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:33,924
They're beautiful.

1120
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:36,966
They?

1121
01:56:38,160 --> 01:56:39,764
You can't kill two.

1122
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:41,922
He sent us what we need.

1123
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:44,767
Oh, no. No. No!

1124
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:47,250
You can't!

1125
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:49,810
No!

1126
01:56:50,240 --> 01:56:51,241
Noah!

1127
01:56:51,680 --> 01:56:52,841
Ila!

1128
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:02,201
Noah. Please.

1129
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:05,615
These are my children!

1130
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:07,961
- Your grandchildren!
- I will not be stopped.

1131
01:57:08,120 --> 01:57:10,575
I know I cannot stop you,
but they're crying!

1132
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:12,841
Please don't let them die crying.

1133
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:16,004
Let me calm them.

1134
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:20,047
Please, just let them be at peace.

1135
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:32,962
<i>The moon is high</i>

1136
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:36,041
<i>The leaves entwine</i>

1137
01:57:37,640 --> 01:57:41,167
<i>Your Father waits for thee</i>

1138
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:48,886
<i>To wrap you in
His sheltering wings</i>

1139
01:57:49,640 --> 01:57:53,565
<i>To whisper you to sleep</i>

1140
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,571
<i>To wrap you in</i>

1141
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:00,562
<i>His welcoming arms</i>

1142
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:05,765
<i>Till the night sky breaks</i>

1143
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:11,882
<i>Your Father is the healing wind</i>

1144
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:16,927
<i>That whispers you to sleep</i>

1145
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:22,365
<i>That whispers as</i>

1146
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:27,011
<i>You sleep</i>

1147
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:34,290
You do not need to see this.

1148
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:36,044
I will hold them.

1149
01:58:45,200 --> 01:58:46,804
Do it quickly.

1150
01:58:58,040 --> 01:58:59,644
Do it quickly!

1151
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:48,284
I cannot do this.

1152
02:00:04,280 --> 02:00:05,805
It's all right.

1153
02:02:58,520 --> 02:03:00,284
Hide your eyes, Japheth.

1154
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,570
- Ham?
- He's here.

1155
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:15,206
You don't have to go.

1156
02:04:18,720 --> 02:04:20,290
I don't belong here.

1157
02:04:22,360 --> 02:04:23,964
For what it's worth,

1158
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:27,491
I'm glad that
it begins again with you.

1159
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:35,201
Maybe we'll learn to be kind.

1160
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:20,445
Will he come back?

1161
02:05:24,920 --> 02:05:27,048
Some things cannot be unbroken.

1162
02:05:35,680 --> 02:05:37,284
I have to know...

1163
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:41,203
Why did you spare them?

1164
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:45,646
I looked down
at those two little girls,

1165
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:48,568
and all I had in my heart
was love.

1166
02:05:52,120 --> 02:05:53,565
Then why are you alone, Noah?

1167
02:05:55,360 --> 02:05:57,727
Why are you separated
from your family?

1168
02:05:59,640 --> 02:06:00,971
Because I failed Him.

1169
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:04,963
And I failed all of you.

1170
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:10,325
Did you?

1171
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:18,242
He chose you for a reason, Noah.

1172
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,480
He showed you
the wickedness of man

1173
02:06:21,680 --> 02:06:24,001
and knew you would
not look away.

1174
02:06:25,680 --> 02:06:27,887
But then you saw goodness, too.

1175
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:33,245
The choice was put in your
hands because He put it there.

1176
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:37,846
He asked you to decide
if we were worth saving.

1177
02:06:40,080 --> 02:06:43,004
And you chose mercy.

1178
02:06:46,360 --> 02:06:47,850
You chose love.

1179
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:55,290
He has given us a second chance.

1180
02:06:56,520 --> 02:06:58,249
<i>Be a father.</i>

1181
02:07:00,040 --> 02:07:02,042
<i>Be a grandfather.</i>

1182
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:06,407
<i>Help us to do better this time.</i>

1183
02:07:09,280 --> 02:07:11,203

02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:22,851
The Creator

1185
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:25,842
made Adam in His image,

1186
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:28,362
and placed the world
in his care.

1187
02:09:29,360 --> 02:09:30,725
That birthright

1188
02:09:32,720 --> 02:09:34,370
was passed down to us.

1189
02:09:38,240 --> 02:09:42,689
To my father, then to me,
and to my sons,

1190
02:09:44,200 --> 02:09:45,247
Shem,

1191
02:09:49,280 --> 02:09:50,361
Japheth,

1192
02:09:54,040 --> 02:09:55,371
and Ham.

1193
02:10:03,360 --> 02:10:05,601
That birthright
is now passed to you,

1194
02:10:07,880 --> 02:10:09,041
our grandchildren.

1195
02:10:13,800 --> 02:10:15,609
This will be your work,

1196
02:10:19,080 --> 02:10:21,082
and your responsibility.

1197
02:10:21,560 --> 02:10:23,244
So I say to you,

1198
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:27,563
be fruitful and multiply

1199
02:10:29,560 --> 02:10:31,562
and replenish the earth.
