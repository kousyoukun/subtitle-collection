2
00:00:22,077 --> 00:00:22,508
Noah!

3
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:24,475
What did He say?

4
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:26,848
He's going to destroy the world.

5
00:00:31,016 --> 00:00:34,435
My father said that one day,
if man continued in his ways,

6
00:00:35,723 --> 00:00:37,967
the creator would annihilate this world.

7
00:00:39,276 --> 00:00:40,296
Can it not be averted?

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,812
He speaks to you.

9
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:44,922
You must trust that he speaks
in a way  that you can understand.

10
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:48,696
I saw water. Death by water.

11
00:00:49,887 --> 00:00:51,412
And I saw a new life.

12
00:00:54,639 --> 00:00:55,716
A great flood is coming.

13
00:00:55,717 --> 00:00:57,927
We'll build a vessel to survive the storm.

14
00:00:58,959 --> 00:00:59,675
We'll build an ark.

15
00:01:02,553 --> 00:01:05,333
- Mama!
- What is it?

16
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:06,350
Them!

17
00:01:08,631 --> 00:01:09,657
What do you want?

18
00:01:09,971 --> 00:01:11,726
You don't know your king.

19
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:13,322
- There isn't anything for you, here.

20
00:01:13,537 --> 00:01:15,759
- I have men at my back

21
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,100
and you stand alone and defy me?

22
00:01:19,498 --> 00:01:20,533
I'm not alone.

23
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:31,655
It begins.

24
00:01:38,546 --> 00:01:41,803
When they come, they will be
desperate and they will be many.

25
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:43,801
Take the ark!

26
00:01:47,202 --> 00:01:49,051
I see how hard this was for you.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,200
Remember, Noah!


28
00:01:52,201 --> 00:01:53,601
He choose you for a reason.

29
00:01:59,755 --> 00:02:02,013
- Is this the end of everything?
- The beginning.

30
00:02:05,586 --> 00:02:06,975
The beginning of everything.
