1
00:01:24,498 --> 00:01:26,542
Lisa.

2
00:03:42,845 --> 00:03:44,763
Inspector, they found Willy Zol.

3
00:03:56,984 --> 00:03:58,402
Hello Bulon.

4
00:03:59,945 --> 00:04:01,780
So they got Willy Zol as well?

5
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:04,032
It looks like a professional job.

6
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:08,996
Siegert tells me that, this
is someone you were after hmm?

7
00:04:09,204 --> 00:04:10,539
Yep.

8
00:04:10,747 --> 00:04:14,209
Zol was almost our last hope
of a lead to Schouermann.

9
00:04:14,418 --> 00:04:15,586
Schouermann again?

10
00:04:17,463 --> 00:04:18,505
Schouermann's behind most things

11
00:04:18,714 --> 00:04:20,799
in the drug world these days.

12
00:04:21,008 --> 00:04:22,342
Including this you think?

13
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,262
100%.

14
00:04:26,513 --> 00:04:27,639
Kaufman and Reinhardt if you remember

15
00:04:27,848 --> 00:04:29,683
were killed in exactly the same way.

16
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:33,187
Just when we were looking for them.

17
00:04:34,605 --> 00:04:35,605
What?

18
00:04:35,805 --> 00:04:36,690
Oh, the Commissioner is here.

19
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:37,899
Thank you.

20
00:04:44,323 --> 00:04:45,323
Good evening sir.

21
00:04:45,523 --> 00:04:46,240
Didn't you tell me

22
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:49,411
Willy Zol was the one man who might talk?

23
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,497
Yes, and I was right.

24
00:04:51,705 --> 00:04:54,500
He phoned me at home tonight
and said he wanted to see me.

25
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,753
I was waiting for him when
the news came about this.

26
00:04:57,961 --> 00:04:59,129
Waiting for him?

27
00:04:59,338 --> 00:05:02,007
Why didn't you go out and grab him?

28
00:05:02,216 --> 00:05:03,342
With all due respect sir,

29
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,302
I could hardly have
known this would happen.

30
00:05:05,511 --> 00:05:07,596
With all due respect to you, Bulon,

31
00:05:07,804 --> 00:05:11,016
you had every reason to expect justice.

32
00:05:11,225 --> 00:05:12,684
Very well sir.

33
00:05:12,893 --> 00:05:14,853
I wish you better luck next time.

34
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:17,021
Let's go.

35
00:05:17,814 --> 00:05:18,982
Goodnight.

36
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:20,191
Goodnight sir.

37
00:05:24,655 --> 00:05:26,990
Now there's one lead sir.

38
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,784
A man from the beer house down the road

39
00:05:28,992 --> 00:05:30,953
says Zol had a drink there tonight.

40
00:05:31,161 --> 00:05:32,161
You wanna talk to him?

41
00:05:34,164 --> 00:05:35,164
Yeah.

42
00:05:38,293 --> 00:05:40,045
Just a moment.

43
00:05:40,254 --> 00:05:41,255
Who's he phoning now?

44
00:05:42,422 --> 00:05:43,549
Who do you think?

45
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:44,967
His wife, of course.

46
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:50,449
Oh hello darling.

47
00:06:50,657 --> 00:06:52,034
So you've come home finally?

48
00:06:52,242 --> 00:06:53,242
I rang you.

49
00:06:53,368 --> 00:06:54,911
Why didn't you answer?

50
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,455
What?

51
00:06:56,663 --> 00:06:58,290
Oh, I suppose I was asleep.

52
00:06:58,498 --> 00:06:59,498
Asleep?

53
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,251
With the phone ringing in your ear?

54
00:07:02,377 --> 00:07:04,171
So I wasn't asleep.

55
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:07,424
Maybe I let it ring on
purpose, just to make you mad.

56
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:09,760
Or maybe I was out, with a lover.

57
00:07:09,968 --> 00:07:11,303
Isn't that what you think?

58
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:13,972
Go on say it, I'm used to it by now.

59
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:55,931
Franz, are you still mad?

60
00:08:52,571 --> 00:08:56,241
- Bulon, I want to ask
you a very frank question.

61
00:08:57,242 --> 00:08:58,368
What is wrong with you?

62
00:09:01,163 --> 00:09:02,163
What do you mean?

63
00:09:02,363 --> 00:09:03,415
I mean what is wrong with you?

64
00:09:07,252 --> 00:09:08,462
Is it personal?

65
00:09:09,755 --> 00:09:12,174
Bulon, what the devil is eating you?

66
00:09:13,216 --> 00:09:15,677
Lisa.

67
00:09:15,886 --> 00:09:16,886
Lisa.

68
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,972
Are you listening?

69
00:09:22,851 --> 00:09:25,103
I said are you listening to me.

70
00:09:25,312 --> 00:09:27,439
Yes, I'm listening.

71
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:28,647
Look here Bulon,

72
00:09:28,774 --> 00:09:31,234
the Schouermann case has
got to be solved, urgently.

73
00:09:31,443 --> 00:09:33,820
And you are head of
the narcotics division.

74
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:36,907
It all depends on you,
if you are not well-

75
00:09:37,115 --> 00:09:38,116
I'm perfectly well.

76
00:09:38,325 --> 00:09:40,577
Alright, so I expect,

77
00:09:40,786 --> 00:09:43,497
in fact I demand results, and quickly.

78
00:09:43,705 --> 00:09:45,874
- Well it's easy to say
that, we're doing all we can.

79
00:09:46,082 --> 00:09:47,793
It isn't enough.

80
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:49,169
This town has got turned

81
00:09:49,377 --> 00:09:52,130
into a key center of the drug traffic.

82
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:53,339
At the Ministry,

83
00:09:53,465 --> 00:09:56,343
they consider Schouermann
an international scandal

84
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:58,386
and in all this time, we don't even know

85
00:09:58,595 --> 00:10:01,598
whether we're dealing
with a man or a thing.

86
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:03,767
One brain or an organization.

87
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,896
You're doing all you can, are you?

88
00:10:10,065 --> 00:10:14,444
But Willy Zol phones you up
and says he wants to talk.

89
00:10:14,653 --> 00:10:18,073
The only man who can really
tell us what we want to know

90
00:10:19,407 --> 00:10:22,536
and you, just sit and wait.

91
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,581
If you had moved, dear old Bulon,

92
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,584
you'd have had Willy
Zol here this morning.

93
00:10:29,793 --> 00:10:30,793
Your wife-

94
00:10:30,993 --> 00:10:32,921
- My wife was cleared
by the investigation,

95
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:34,714
completely cleared.

96
00:10:34,923 --> 00:10:36,967
Otherwise, I'd never had married her.

97
00:10:37,175 --> 00:10:38,175
I know but-

98
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,009
But nothing.

99
00:10:42,055 --> 00:10:43,890
Will you excuse me sir?

100
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:45,976
I have something important to attend to.

101
00:11:05,745 --> 00:11:08,123
- We are viewing last nights
round up in Room A sir.

102
00:11:08,331 --> 00:11:09,583
Want to see them?

103
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,779
The Rabbit.

104
00:11:39,988 --> 00:11:42,032
I haven't seen him around for a long time.

105
00:11:43,241 --> 00:11:45,160
Kruger, you start on him.

106
00:11:46,494 --> 00:11:48,246
And don't be too polite, understand.

107
00:11:50,415 --> 00:11:51,415
Where'd you get her?

108
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:52,667
- We picked her
up from the roulette tables

109
00:11:52,876 --> 00:11:54,544
in Fritz's at three this morning.

110
00:11:54,753 --> 00:11:56,004
I want to talk to her.

111
00:11:57,756 --> 00:11:59,049
Morning Bulon.

112
00:11:59,257 --> 00:12:00,717
Oh hello Mansfeld.

113
00:12:00,926 --> 00:12:01,927
You wanted to see me'?

114
00:12:03,053 --> 00:12:04,804
Yeah, yeah, I'd like a word with you.

115
00:12:05,013 --> 00:12:06,014
Get everything on tape.

116
00:12:09,935 --> 00:12:10,977
From the direction of the wound,

117
00:12:11,186 --> 00:12:13,396
I would say the killer's a tall man.

118
00:12:13,605 --> 00:12:17,400
Pretty strong, judged by the
bruise left by the knife hilt.

119
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:19,736
- And that's just about
all we've got to go on.

120
00:12:19,945 --> 00:12:21,571
No fingerprints, nothing.

121
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,781
How about the knife?

122
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:25,659
- Mass produced, like the
raincoat and the gloves.

123
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:28,286
Cheap stuff anyone could
pick up in a chain store.

124
00:12:28,495 --> 00:12:30,455
What about the beer house?

125
00:12:30,664 --> 00:12:33,041
You followed up on that,
Siegert didn't you?

126
00:12:33,249 --> 00:12:34,249
Yes sir.

127
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:36,920
- We searched the beer house
dry and got exactly nowhere.

128
00:12:37,963 --> 00:12:39,714
The owner says Willy Zol
came in about half past 10

129
00:12:39,923 --> 00:12:41,675
and had a couple of drinks.

130
00:12:41,883 --> 00:12:44,135
He seemed a bit nervous,
but no one spoke to him,

131
00:12:44,344 --> 00:12:45,387
no one came near him.

132
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:59,359
It was 11 o'clock when he left and.

133
00:13:01,987 --> 00:13:03,488
Is something wrong?

134
00:13:03,697 --> 00:13:04,697
Huh?

135
00:13:04,897 --> 00:13:05,656
Oh no, no nothing, no.

136
00:13:05,856 --> 00:13:07,450
Sorry Mansfeld, where were we?

137
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:10,996
- It was 11 o'clock when Zol
left the beer house Inspector.

138
00:13:11,204 --> 00:13:12,204
- Excuse me.
- What is it?

139
00:13:12,404 --> 00:13:13,331
You wanted to see that girl?

140
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,540
Yeah.

141
00:13:14,582 --> 00:13:15,582
Any luck with Strauss?

142
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:16,876
Nothing sir.

143
00:13:17,085 --> 00:13:20,588
- Well, we seem to have
drawn blank all round.

144
00:13:20,797 --> 00:13:21,797
It seems so for the moment.

145
00:13:21,798 --> 00:13:23,842
- Bring the girl in will you?
- Let me know, sir.

146
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,050
If anything crops up.

147
00:13:25,176 --> 00:13:26,176
I'll keep in touch.

148
00:13:42,277 --> 00:13:43,277
Sit there.

149
00:13:53,913 --> 00:13:58,877
Lisa.

150
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:06,843
What's your name?

151
00:14:07,052 --> 00:14:08,261
Marianne.

152
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,180
Marrianne De Lomac.

153
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:11,973
How old are you?

154
00:14:12,182 --> 00:14:13,224
19.

155
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:14,726
19.

156
00:14:14,934 --> 00:14:16,311
And you take drugs?

157
00:14:17,812 --> 00:14:19,481
- Then what were you
doing at Fritz's Roulette?

158
00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:20,689
Nothing.

159
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:22,150
Nothing, you weren't gambling?

160
00:14:22,358 --> 00:14:23,358
No.

161
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:24,234
Who were you with?

162
00:14:24,235 --> 00:14:25,235
Nobody.

163
00:14:25,945 --> 00:14:26,945
Looking for customers eh?

164
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:28,113
No, I swear.

165
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,868
- So you weren't gambling,
you weren't getting fixed

166
00:14:32,077 --> 00:14:33,953
and you weren't looking for customers.

167
00:14:34,996 --> 00:14:36,915
But there you were, all alone,

168
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:39,375
three o'clock in the
morning, doing nothing.

169
00:14:42,378 --> 00:14:43,378
Who sent you there?

170
00:14:44,214 --> 00:14:46,841
Nobody, nobody sent me.

171
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,050
I don't know what you're talking about.

172
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:49,134
Yes you do.

173
00:14:49,844 --> 00:14:53,014
Somebody sent you to see
Fritz, to fetch something.

174
00:14:54,182 --> 00:14:55,182
Now who was it?

175
00:15:00,563 --> 00:15:01,898
You better tell me you know.

176
00:15:06,694 --> 00:15:07,694
Right.

177
00:15:09,322 --> 00:15:10,322
Tell me this.

178
00:15:11,491 --> 00:15:14,202
What time did you arrive at Fritz's?

179
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,996
About, about half past two.

180
00:15:24,587 --> 00:15:25,587
Siegert.

181
00:15:25,787 --> 00:15:26,421
Yes sir.

182
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:27,256
What time was the murder?

183
00:15:27,298 --> 00:15:28,591
Just after 11.

184
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,177
2:15 eh?

185
00:15:31,386 --> 00:15:32,554
Yes that fits.

186
00:15:33,471 --> 00:15:35,473
I've got the girl here now.

187
00:15:35,682 --> 00:15:37,809
Says she arrived at Fritz's at 2:30.

188
00:15:38,017 --> 00:15:39,017
Huh?

189
00:15:39,217 --> 00:15:39,894
Oh yes, I got it.

190
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:42,063
No, no no, no alibi at all.

191
00:15:42,272 --> 00:15:44,440
No, she just refuses to talk.

192
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:45,649
Hmm.

193
00:15:45,849 --> 00:15:46,651
Looks as if I have to charge her.

194
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,860
Come on in will you.

195
00:15:47,944 --> 00:15:50,113
I don't know what you're talking about.

196
00:15:50,321 --> 00:15:51,781
There's been a murder Marianne.

197
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,990
A murder?

198
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:53,824
Yeah.

199
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,286
And you know, when we ask people questions

200
00:15:56,494 --> 00:15:58,746
and they don't answer, we get suspicious.

201
00:15:59,747 --> 00:16:02,625
And you've no alibi for quarter past two.

202
00:16:02,834 --> 00:16:04,419
- But I-
- Now unless you can tell me

203
00:16:04,627 --> 00:16:06,713
where you were at quarter
past two, you're going to be-

204
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:08,173
I was at Ursula's.

205
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:14,387
Now who's Ursula?

206
00:16:14,596 --> 00:16:16,264
Ursula Stein, a friend of mine.

207
00:16:17,223 --> 00:16:18,516
Will she confirm that?

208
00:16:18,725 --> 00:16:19,725
Of course.

209
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:21,811
Ursula Stein, huh?

210
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,021
Address?

211
00:16:23,229 --> 00:16:24,229
Sonnet Strasse 23.

212
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:25,398
When did you leave there?

213
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:27,275
I don't know, about half past two.

214
00:16:27,483 --> 00:16:29,402
Did you go straight to Fritz's?

215
00:16:29,611 --> 00:16:30,820
Yes.

216
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:32,029
Did Ursula ask you to?

217
00:16:32,197 --> 00:16:34,240
Yes, no no no, she didn't.

218
00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:35,700
Yes she did, why?

219
00:16:35,909 --> 00:16:38,369
- Oh god, I don't wanna
get Ursula into trouble.

220
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,915
Does Ursula use the drugs herself?

221
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,501
So she wanted the stuff for someone else?

222
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,711
A man?

223
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,920
Her boyfriend?

224
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:54,427
Alright Marianne, alright.

225
00:16:56,304 --> 00:16:59,849
Now then, what's Ursula's boyfriends name?

226
00:17:00,058 --> 00:17:02,268
Kurt, Kurt Muller.

227
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,107
Why didn't he go to Fritz's himself?

228
00:17:08,316 --> 00:17:10,151
He can't, they're after him.

229
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,360
Who's they?

230
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:13,363
Schouermann?

231
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,824
Then why didn't Ursula go?

232
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,160
They know her, they don't know me.

233
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:21,120
- He must have needed
that stuff pretty badly

234
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:23,748
to send you to Fritz's at
three o'clock in the morning.

235
00:17:23,957 --> 00:17:24,957
Where is he now?

236
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,459
He's hiding at Ursula's.

237
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:28,920
Why doesn't he come to us?

238
00:17:29,128 --> 00:17:32,131
- He's too scared, you don't
know what they're like.

239
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,425
And anyway, maybe he's done something bad.

240
00:17:34,634 --> 00:17:36,719
They used to make him see.

241
00:17:36,928 --> 00:17:38,513
He's hooked on that stuff.

242
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:39,721
The cocaine?

243
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:41,224
So he couldn't say no.

244
00:17:41,432 --> 00:17:44,310
Oh god, oh god, they'll kill me for this.

245
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:47,479
Don't worry.

246
00:17:47,647 --> 00:17:49,941
For the time being we're
going to keep you here.

247
00:17:51,901 --> 00:17:53,903
I'm under arrest?

248
00:17:54,112 --> 00:17:55,112
No, no.

249
00:17:55,113 --> 00:17:57,198
Not now you've explained things to us.

250
00:17:57,407 --> 00:17:59,575
But you'll be safer here.

251
00:17:59,784 --> 00:18:00,784
No, no.

252
00:18:03,204 --> 00:18:04,204
Your wife is here.

253
00:18:04,404 --> 00:18:05,248
Here?

254
00:18:05,456 --> 00:18:06,666
- Hello.
- Hello.

255
00:18:11,379 --> 00:18:12,714
May I come in.

256
00:18:12,922 --> 00:18:14,799
Yes, yes come in.

257
00:18:15,008 --> 00:18:16,008
Kruger.

258
00:18:17,176 --> 00:18:18,845
Please come with me.

259
00:18:23,683 --> 00:18:26,144
Well, aren't you happy to see me?

260
00:18:26,352 --> 00:18:27,854
Of course I'm happy to see you.

261
00:18:28,062 --> 00:18:30,231
Listen darling, I need some money.

262
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,734
I feel like buying something
wildly extravagant.

263
00:18:33,693 --> 00:18:34,693
How much?

264
00:18:43,202 --> 00:18:44,537
That'll do thank you.

265
00:18:45,747 --> 00:18:47,206
Lisa.

266
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,876
I tried to call you, you were out.

267
00:18:50,084 --> 00:18:51,919
Of course, I was on my way here.

268
00:18:52,128 --> 00:18:53,254
Where are you going now?

269
00:18:53,463 --> 00:18:54,756
To spend your money.

270
00:18:54,964 --> 00:18:56,799
First of all I want to buy a walkie talkie

271
00:18:57,008 --> 00:18:59,010
so you can keep track of me wherever I go.

272
00:19:00,094 --> 00:19:01,094
Jealous.

273
00:19:03,806 --> 00:19:04,806
Come in.

274
00:19:06,434 --> 00:19:07,643
Oh good morning Mrs. Bulon.

275
00:19:07,852 --> 00:19:09,479
- Hello.
- Kurt Muller, Ursula Stein.

276
00:19:09,687 --> 00:19:10,687
Excuse me.

277
00:19:11,981 --> 00:19:13,566
Something to work on at last.

278
00:19:18,196 --> 00:19:20,114
Work, work, that's all you do.

279
00:19:22,116 --> 00:19:26,287
Lisa, look I'm sorry, but I'm very busy.

280
00:19:26,496 --> 00:19:29,707
Alright, I have things to do too.

281
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,584
- Lisa-
- Goodbye darling.

282
00:19:36,172 --> 00:19:40,426
- Kurt Muller, here's somebody
who can tell us something.

283
00:19:40,635 --> 00:19:42,678
He's hiding out for the
moment at Sonnet Strasse, 23,

284
00:19:42,887 --> 00:19:44,680
with his girlfriend Ursula Stein.

285
00:19:56,109 --> 00:19:57,527
Where is Muller?

286
00:19:57,735 --> 00:19:58,861
Where has he gone?

287
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,071
I don't know.

288
00:20:02,865 --> 00:20:04,075
Liar.

289
00:20:04,283 --> 00:20:05,660
We said where is he?

290
00:20:05,868 --> 00:20:06,953
Out with it.

291
00:20:07,161 --> 00:20:08,161
I don't know.

292
00:20:08,361 --> 00:20:08,995
- You don't know
where your own boyfriend is?

293
00:20:09,163 --> 00:20:10,790
I don't see him anymore.

294
00:20:14,293 --> 00:20:17,004
- Alright you
bitch, you're coming with us.

295
00:20:17,213 --> 00:20:18,213
Move.

296
00:21:22,028 --> 00:21:23,028
Where's Muller?

297
00:21:23,228 --> 00:21:24,989
How do you know they didn't take him too?

298
00:21:25,198 --> 00:21:26,407
It was the only the girl.

299
00:21:26,616 --> 00:21:28,826
The woman downstairs saw her
being dragged out to a car

300
00:21:29,035 --> 00:21:30,119
by three thugs.

301
00:21:30,328 --> 00:21:31,787
Muller must have gotten away.

302
00:21:31,996 --> 00:21:33,664
I'd just like to know how it is,

303
00:21:33,873 --> 00:21:35,500
that every time I start
looking for somebody

304
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,210
they get there first.

305
00:21:37,418 --> 00:21:40,046
Damn it Siegert, nobody knew
about this but you and me.

306
00:21:42,965 --> 00:21:45,426
It was probably a coincidence.

307
00:21:45,635 --> 00:21:48,095
- There have been too many
damn coincidences lately.

308
00:21:51,557 --> 00:21:56,521
Listen Siegert, we've got to
find Muller before they do.

309
00:21:58,689 --> 00:21:59,689
Is that clear?

310
00:21:59,857 --> 00:22:00,857
Yes sir.

311
00:22:19,627 --> 00:22:21,462
Hey, you want the latest news?

312
00:22:21,671 --> 00:22:24,423
Yeah, but not that sort.

313
00:22:25,508 --> 00:22:27,635
Sorry, no change.

314
00:22:27,843 --> 00:22:28,843
Nevermind.

315
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:29,970
Alright.

316
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,227
What do you wanna know Inspector?

317
00:22:36,435 --> 00:22:38,187
Where to find a man called Muller?

318
00:22:38,396 --> 00:22:39,396
Muller?

319
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,480
Kurt Muller.

320
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,691
Take the money, I don't want it.

321
00:22:43,568 --> 00:22:44,902
Anything else?

322
00:22:45,111 --> 00:22:47,697
- There was one thing
I wanted to tell you.

323
00:22:47,905 --> 00:22:49,615
Weird, pretty strange.

324
00:22:50,866 --> 00:22:52,577
Tulips mean anything to you sir?

325
00:22:55,538 --> 00:22:57,915
- Could be that it was
only a stupid, little joke.

326
00:22:58,124 --> 00:22:59,375
But I don't let anything go.

327
00:23:00,293 --> 00:23:03,504
Last week or so, I've
heard a lot about flowers.

328
00:23:03,713 --> 00:23:05,131
Tulips yeah.

329
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:08,676
I don't know, but that's
the story on the street.

330
00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:12,888
Well it's not much to go on,

331
00:23:14,098 --> 00:23:16,475
but try and find out some
more and let me know, okay.

332
00:23:16,684 --> 00:23:18,686
You know me Inspector, see you.

333
00:23:18,894 --> 00:23:19,894
Hmm.

334
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,450
Hi Olaf.

335
00:23:34,493 --> 00:23:35,493
Hi Max.

336
00:23:52,803 --> 00:23:53,804
Not gonna count it?

337
00:23:54,013 --> 00:23:55,013
No, I trust you.

338
00:23:56,474 --> 00:23:58,726
Now let's shake hands and call it quits.

339
00:23:58,934 --> 00:23:59,934
I'm buying myself

340
00:24:00,134 --> 00:24:02,313
a very expensive plane
ticket in the morning.

341
00:24:02,521 --> 00:24:04,774
- Hey wait, they've got
one more job to be done.

342
00:24:04,982 --> 00:24:06,025
Oh no, not for me.

343
00:24:06,233 --> 00:24:08,694
Three jobs is plenty as
far as I'm concerned.

344
00:24:11,197 --> 00:24:15,034
- One more, one less,
what's the difference?

345
00:24:15,242 --> 00:24:17,953
- How often do you think a
man can get away with murder?

346
00:24:18,162 --> 00:24:19,497
I've been lucky.

347
00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:20,873
I wanna stay lucky.

348
00:24:21,082 --> 00:24:23,709
- You don't understand Max,
there isn't much choice.

349
00:24:26,295 --> 00:24:27,546
What do you mean?

350
00:24:27,755 --> 00:24:31,509
You wanna go away, not tomorrow.

351
00:24:31,717 --> 00:24:33,511
Go the day after tomorrow.

352
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:34,720
Take my advice.

353
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:37,556
If you wanna be around
to catch that plane,

354
00:24:37,765 --> 00:24:39,100
well then do what I tell you.

355
00:24:43,729 --> 00:24:44,729
Want it?

356
00:25:20,057 --> 00:25:21,057
Who is it?

357
00:25:23,185 --> 00:25:24,937
His name is Kurt Muller.

358
00:25:34,196 --> 00:25:39,160
Lisa.

359
00:25:41,412 --> 00:25:42,412
Lisa?

360
00:25:59,346 --> 00:26:01,056
- Darling,
I called the office

361
00:26:01,265 --> 00:26:02,516
but you were not there.

362
00:26:02,725 --> 00:26:04,602
I've gone to supper at Oust De Pavion

363
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,562
with a school friend of mine.

364
00:26:06,771 --> 00:26:07,771
Love Lisa.

365
00:26:14,195 --> 00:26:15,488
Good evening sir, may I help you?

366
00:26:15,696 --> 00:26:17,198
Would you like a table?

367
00:26:17,406 --> 00:26:18,407
No thank you.

368
00:26:18,616 --> 00:26:19,658
Very well sir.

369
00:26:25,581 --> 00:26:27,625
Do you happen to have seen a young lady

370
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:28,833
wearing a white coat?

371
00:26:30,044 --> 00:26:31,504
Yes, yes beautiful.

372
00:26:32,463 --> 00:26:35,674
She came in, looked
around, then she went out.

373
00:26:35,883 --> 00:26:39,178
Got back into her car and drove away.

374
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,180
Her car?

375
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,683
Yes sir, a beautiful red Porsche.

376
00:26:45,935 --> 00:26:46,935
Thanks.

377
00:27:12,795 --> 00:27:15,631
Why don't you look out, bastard!

378
00:27:36,944 --> 00:27:37,944
Did he call?

379
00:27:38,028 --> 00:27:39,028
No.

380
00:27:41,282 --> 00:27:43,200
Muller will show up, don't worry.

381
00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:45,160
He can't do without his snow.

382
00:27:49,748 --> 00:27:52,459
- Hello boys.
- Alright Fritz.

383
00:27:57,006 --> 00:27:58,006
Yes.

384
00:27:58,966 --> 00:28:00,301
Hello Muller.

385
00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:01,509
What'd I tell you?

386
00:28:01,552 --> 00:28:03,345
That Muller's a fool.

387
00:28:03,554 --> 00:28:04,554
Yes.

388
00:28:05,639 --> 00:28:07,808
No, you can't come here,
we're being watched.

389
00:28:08,017 --> 00:28:09,017
Who by?

390
00:28:09,768 --> 00:28:10,768
By everyone.

391
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,813
Yes, I understand.

392
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,066
Okay, listen to me.

393
00:28:18,527 --> 00:28:21,071
Go to New Valley Strasse number three.

394
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,490
At one o'clock, got that?

395
00:28:23,699 --> 00:28:25,284
Great, contact Max.

396
00:28:25,492 --> 00:28:26,492
Yes, one o'clock.

397
00:28:27,786 --> 00:28:31,707
Not before or you won't
find anything, understand.

398
00:28:31,916 --> 00:28:33,959
Walk in the entrance

399
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,504
and on the left you'll
find some letter boxes.

400
00:28:37,713 --> 00:28:39,924
Look for the one with
the name Weiner on it.

401
00:28:40,132 --> 00:28:41,132
It won't be locked.

402
00:28:42,009 --> 00:28:43,009
Open it.

403
00:29:41,235 --> 00:29:44,071
Hello darling, you gave me a fright.

404
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:45,948
Where have you been?

405
00:29:46,156 --> 00:29:48,158
Why, didn't you find my note?

406
00:29:48,367 --> 00:29:49,618
Yes, I found it.

407
00:29:49,827 --> 00:29:51,912
And I went to the Oust
De Pavion restaurant.

408
00:29:53,163 --> 00:29:54,289
You weren't there.

409
00:29:54,498 --> 00:29:55,749
- I don't know what you're
trying to insinuate,

410
00:29:55,958 --> 00:29:58,752
or why I have to justify
every step I take.

411
00:29:59,712 --> 00:30:01,380
But all the same, I'm going to tell you

412
00:30:01,588 --> 00:30:04,883
exactly why you didn't find
me at the Oust De Pavion.

413
00:30:05,092 --> 00:30:08,178
I arrived ahead of
time, Maria hadn't come.

414
00:30:08,387 --> 00:30:11,056
So I went to pick her up at her hotel,

415
00:30:11,265 --> 00:30:12,265
and then we changed our minds

416
00:30:12,391 --> 00:30:14,018
and had dinner sent up to her room.

417
00:30:17,021 --> 00:30:19,314
Are you satisfied now Mr. Policeman?

418
00:30:20,524 --> 00:30:22,317
And who did the Porsche belong to?

419
00:30:27,448 --> 00:30:28,448
What?

420
00:30:29,575 --> 00:30:31,118
Who did the Porsche belong to?

421
00:30:32,286 --> 00:30:34,163
Oh god, you're unbearable.

422
00:30:34,371 --> 00:30:36,290
Can't you ever stop grilling people?

423
00:30:36,498 --> 00:30:38,500
You haven't answered my question.

424
00:30:38,709 --> 00:30:41,128
Who did the Porsche belong to?

425
00:30:41,336 --> 00:30:42,463
I want the truth.

426
00:30:42,671 --> 00:30:44,423
To lreni Von Klaus, how about that?

427
00:30:44,631 --> 00:30:47,384
You know where lreni
Von Klaus is don't you?

428
00:30:47,593 --> 00:30:51,180
She's the President of the
lnternode German Association

429
00:30:51,388 --> 00:30:53,682
and she committed the
crime of giving me a life.

430
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,894
What's the matter?

431
00:30:57,102 --> 00:30:58,103
Don't you believe me?

432
00:30:59,938 --> 00:31:00,939
I wish I could.

433
00:31:01,148 --> 00:31:02,691
You wish you could.

434
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,320
Listen to me, you may spend
your days bullying people,

435
00:31:06,528 --> 00:31:08,572
beating them up, making little girls cry

436
00:31:08,781 --> 00:31:10,991
but you can't do it at
home, you understand?

437
00:31:11,909 --> 00:31:14,870
I'm not a criminal and I
refuse to be treated like one.

438
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,372
I've had enough.

439
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:21,710
So what are you gonna do?

440
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:22,919
Leave me?

441
00:31:24,421 --> 00:31:25,839
What do you expect me to do?

442
00:31:26,048 --> 00:31:28,008
Keep paying all my life for one mistake?

443
00:31:29,301 --> 00:31:30,469
What mistake was that?

444
00:31:30,677 --> 00:31:32,679
Making friends with Reinhardt?

445
00:31:32,888 --> 00:31:35,974
I knew you'd drag that up again.

446
00:31:36,183 --> 00:31:37,810
That was a big crime wasn't it?

447
00:31:38,018 --> 00:31:40,646
- It was big mistake, and
it nearly sent you to jail.

448
00:31:40,854 --> 00:31:41,854
Jail?

449
00:31:42,054 --> 00:31:42,856
I am in jail.

450
00:31:43,065 --> 00:31:44,065
I can't go out,

451
00:31:44,265 --> 00:31:46,026
you don't want me to see
anybody or do anything.

452
00:31:46,235 --> 00:31:48,946
All you want me to do
is sit home and wait.

453
00:31:49,154 --> 00:31:52,407
Well I'm too young to be
buried alive, and you know it.

454
00:31:52,616 --> 00:31:55,577
You just can't believe
I'm faithful can you?

455
00:31:56,745 --> 00:31:58,956
Well I'm going to teach
you a lesson Mr. Bulon.

456
00:31:59,164 --> 00:32:01,625
Now I'm really going
to get myself a lover.

457
00:32:12,344 --> 00:32:14,471
Don't you touch me.

458
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:45,836
- Tulips
mean anything to you sir?

459
00:32:46,044 --> 00:32:47,045
Tulips?

460
00:32:54,094 --> 00:32:55,304
Hello sir.

461
00:32:55,512 --> 00:32:56,512
Who is it?

462
00:32:56,555 --> 00:32:58,223
Siegert here.

463
00:32:58,432 --> 00:32:59,432
They killed Muller.

464
00:33:01,143 --> 00:33:02,561
Hello?

465
00:33:02,769 --> 00:33:03,769
Hello sir?

466
00:33:04,605 --> 00:33:06,356
Do you hear me?

467
00:33:06,565 --> 00:33:08,066
Yes I heard.

468
00:33:08,275 --> 00:33:09,359
They've killed Muller.

469
00:33:20,162 --> 00:33:21,538
- Max.
- Hi Greta.

470
00:33:33,842 --> 00:33:35,135
Clever boy.

471
00:33:35,344 --> 00:33:36,720
Today's Tuesday.

472
00:33:38,055 --> 00:33:39,431
You don't say?

473
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,640
What does it mean?

474
00:33:41,558 --> 00:33:45,145
It means, it means that I'm free.

475
00:33:45,354 --> 00:33:46,813
I'm not singing tonight.

476
00:33:47,022 --> 00:33:48,690
Thank god.

477
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:51,944
Max, don't be nasty.

478
00:33:52,152 --> 00:33:53,737
You know what I mean.

479
00:33:53,946 --> 00:33:55,072
That I can stay with you.

480
00:33:56,114 --> 00:33:57,783
Who says I want to stay with you?

481
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,784
Don't you?

482
00:34:00,619 --> 00:34:03,330
- Well, after all it's
not such a bad idea.

483
00:34:03,538 --> 00:34:04,998
Hmm.

484
00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:11,128
It's too crowded here.

485
00:34:11,129 --> 00:34:13,131
Come on, let's have scotches.
- Alright.

486
00:34:17,427 --> 00:34:18,595
- Good evening.
- Two scotches.

487
00:34:18,804 --> 00:34:20,222
Right away.

488
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,391
Two scotches.
- Thank you.

489
00:34:28,689 --> 00:34:29,689
That watch right?

490
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:30,774
Yes sir, always right to the second.

491
00:34:30,983 --> 00:34:32,442
Then mine's fast.

492
00:34:33,527 --> 00:34:34,527
6 marks sir.

493
00:34:38,573 --> 00:34:39,573
What's happened?

494
00:34:40,492 --> 00:34:41,492
Lose something?

495
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,898
Looks like this is up your street again.

496
00:35:12,107 --> 00:35:13,275
Same technique, Herr Doctor.

497
00:35:13,483 --> 00:35:15,986
- Wounds look exactly
like Zol's, identical.

498
00:35:16,194 --> 00:35:18,405
And he had this, sir, in his hand.

499
00:35:18,613 --> 00:35:19,613
What is it?

500
00:35:19,813 --> 00:35:20,532
Cocaine?

501
00:35:20,741 --> 00:35:21,741
What do you think?

502
00:35:25,954 --> 00:35:27,622
Bicarbonate of soda.

503
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:30,250
- Send this down to the
lab and get it checked.

504
00:35:30,459 --> 00:35:31,626
Yes sir.

505
00:35:31,835 --> 00:35:33,170
See you tomorrow Bulon.

506
00:35:37,132 --> 00:35:39,593
- Little bicarbonate of
soda in a letterbox eh?

507
00:35:39,801 --> 00:35:42,512
Well it's quite a neat little trick.

508
00:35:42,721 --> 00:35:45,098
They took the girls so he
had to fetch it himself.

509
00:35:47,351 --> 00:35:48,477
The idiot.

510
00:35:48,685 --> 00:35:50,062
He must have phoned someone.

511
00:35:52,105 --> 00:35:53,315
Yeah.

512
00:35:53,523 --> 00:35:54,523
Maybe Fritz?

513
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,400
Don't you think it's time

514
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,028
we did something about Fritz, Inspector?

515
00:35:59,404 --> 00:36:00,404
Yeah.

516
00:36:05,118 --> 00:36:08,747
Herr Siegert, I want you to find out

517
00:36:08,955 --> 00:36:12,876
if somebody called lreni
Von Klaus has a red Porsche?

518
00:36:13,085 --> 00:36:14,127
Who

519
00:36:14,336 --> 00:36:15,336
Ireni Von Klaus?

520
00:36:17,047 --> 00:36:19,549
Yes lreni Von Klaus.

521
00:36:19,758 --> 00:36:22,135
I want to know if she has a red Porsche!

522
00:38:14,956 --> 00:38:15,956
Who is it?

523
00:38:15,999 --> 00:38:16,999
It's me Max.

524
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:17,875
Let me in.

525
00:38:22,422 --> 00:38:23,422
What the devil?

526
00:38:23,622 --> 00:38:24,340
At this hour, are you crazy?

527
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,093
I've lost, my lucky dollar.

528
00:38:29,179 --> 00:38:30,179
You don't say.

529
00:38:32,349 --> 00:38:34,851
Is that the end of world?

530
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,102
Yes, for me it is.

531
00:38:37,646 --> 00:38:39,356
Well, I haven't got it.

532
00:38:40,232 --> 00:38:41,816
I had it this evening, I know I did.

533
00:38:42,025 --> 00:38:43,025
I was sitting here.

534
00:38:43,151 --> 00:38:46,738
- Maybe you lost it
somewhere else, so what?

535
00:38:46,947 --> 00:38:48,532
So I'm superstitious okay.

536
00:38:49,574 --> 00:38:50,574
So what?

537
00:38:52,661 --> 00:38:54,454
- That dollar brought
me luck, now it's gone.

538
00:38:54,663 --> 00:38:55,663
I'm scared.

539
00:38:56,706 --> 00:39:00,168
This last job was one too
many, I told you so, I knew it.

540
00:39:00,377 --> 00:39:02,379
Nobody's luck holds out forever

541
00:39:02,587 --> 00:39:04,130
and mine's gone now, I feel it.

542
00:39:05,924 --> 00:39:07,842
If I don't find that lucky dollar tonight,

543
00:39:08,051 --> 00:39:09,051
I'm getting out.

544
00:39:09,251 --> 00:39:11,012
I'm getting out so fast you won't see me.

545
00:39:11,221 --> 00:39:12,221
Are you finished?

546
00:39:16,309 --> 00:39:17,894
Now listen boy, you're in it.

547
00:39:18,103 --> 00:39:20,105
Will you cram it into your
head once and for all.

548
00:39:20,313 --> 00:39:22,941
Schouermann couldn't care
less about your lucky dollar.

549
00:39:28,238 --> 00:39:30,407
- To hell with Schouermann
and with you too.

550
00:39:32,617 --> 00:39:34,077
Morning Inspector.

551
00:39:35,745 --> 00:39:36,913
Good morning sir.

552
00:39:37,122 --> 00:39:39,624
- Siegert, did you find
out about the Porsche?

553
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:41,710
- The Porsche?
- Yes the Porsche.

554
00:39:41,918 --> 00:39:43,044
Oh yes, I'm sorry.

555
00:39:43,253 --> 00:39:45,922
With all this business, I'll
go and check it right away.

556
00:39:49,134 --> 00:39:50,134
- Heinz.
- Yes sir.

557
00:39:50,218 --> 00:39:51,636
Send someone up from the lab will you?

558
00:39:51,845 --> 00:39:53,471
Right away.

559
00:39:57,183 --> 00:39:58,643
Come in.

560
00:39:58,852 --> 00:40:00,937
Morning sir, I brought some coffee.

561
00:40:01,146 --> 00:40:02,146
Thanks.

562
00:40:04,065 --> 00:40:05,065
Kruger.

563
00:40:06,818 --> 00:40:09,738
Do tulips mean anything to you?

564
00:40:09,946 --> 00:40:12,073
- Tulips?
- Yes.

565
00:40:12,282 --> 00:40:15,076
Yellow tulips, do they
mean anything to you?

566
00:40:16,202 --> 00:40:19,748
I don't know sir, I really couldn't say.

567
00:40:21,249 --> 00:40:22,792
Why?

568
00:40:23,001 --> 00:40:24,001
You onto something?

569
00:40:26,421 --> 00:40:27,631
Oh who knows.

570
00:40:48,652 --> 00:40:50,111
How are you?

571
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,320
I'm fine.

572
00:41:00,705 --> 00:41:01,705
Come in.

573
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:04,583
Sir ?

574
00:41:04,783 --> 00:41:05,501
Check this for prints

575
00:41:05,701 --> 00:41:06,670
and have it brought back
to me personally will you?

576
00:41:06,878 --> 00:41:07,878
Yes sir.

577
00:41:14,844 --> 00:41:17,180
- I want to see all the film
shot in the waiting room

578
00:41:17,389 --> 00:41:18,515
over the past year.

579
00:41:18,723 --> 00:41:19,723
All of them?

580
00:41:19,923 --> 00:41:20,557
All of them.

581
00:41:20,558 --> 00:41:22,977
He's gonna be here for hours.

582
00:41:41,996 --> 00:41:44,207
What date's this?

583
00:41:44,416 --> 00:41:47,127
- Around approximately,
March, just a year ago.

584
00:41:51,673 --> 00:41:53,550
This is April coming up now.

585
00:42:05,979 --> 00:42:07,647
Get me the files on those two.

586
00:42:10,108 --> 00:42:11,818
Have you finished sir?

587
00:42:12,026 --> 00:42:13,319
Yes thanks. for the moment.

588
00:42:18,491 --> 00:42:19,491
Good morning Bulon.

589
00:42:19,617 --> 00:42:20,617
Good morning sir.

590
00:42:20,817 --> 00:42:21,535
You look worried,

591
00:42:21,703 --> 00:42:23,288
as a matter of fact I
was coming to see you.

592
00:42:23,496 --> 00:42:25,749
So we've had another killing huh?

593
00:42:27,542 --> 00:42:30,003
Someone I was looking for, as usual.

594
00:42:30,211 --> 00:42:31,211
What?

595
00:42:31,212 --> 00:42:33,423
- I never even knew Muller
existed until yesterday.

596
00:42:33,631 --> 00:42:35,258
Then I started looking for him

597
00:42:35,467 --> 00:42:37,927
and in a matter of hours he got stabbed.

598
00:42:38,136 --> 00:42:39,512
Did you let the girl go?

599
00:42:39,721 --> 00:42:41,681
No, she's still here.

600
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:43,850
That's what worries me.

601
00:42:44,058 --> 00:42:47,187
How many people knew about this?

602
00:42:47,395 --> 00:42:48,605
Very few.

603
00:42:48,813 --> 00:42:50,982
Let's go into your office.

604
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:10,585
- Excuse me, I brought
those files you asked for.

605
00:43:10,794 --> 00:43:11,794
Oh thank you.

606
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,881
Who are they?

607
00:43:15,965 --> 00:43:17,842
Eric Schurre, he's just a lead.

608
00:43:18,051 --> 00:43:20,804
It's his friend I'm after, Max Lindt.

609
00:43:21,846 --> 00:43:24,098
Mind you, it's only a hunch no more.

610
00:43:24,307 --> 00:43:26,684
This time, I'm gonna handle it myself.

611
00:43:26,893 --> 00:43:28,812
Max Lindt, the one from Marseilles.

612
00:43:30,855 --> 00:43:33,024
No police record.

613
00:43:33,233 --> 00:43:35,318
No, he was caught in a round up

614
00:43:35,527 --> 00:43:37,153
a few months ago by mistake,

615
00:43:37,362 --> 00:43:38,905
or so he had us believe.

616
00:43:39,113 --> 00:43:41,658
But I remember him because
of a funny trick he had

617
00:43:41,866 --> 00:43:43,827
of playing with something in his hand

618
00:43:44,035 --> 00:43:45,495
all the time, like this.

619
00:43:47,121 --> 00:43:49,082
He was very nervous too.

620
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:51,835
- You haven't told me
why you're after him?

621
00:43:52,043 --> 00:43:54,671
Well I told you sir, it's only a hunch.

622
00:43:54,879 --> 00:43:57,507
For the moment I'd rather
not tell you any more.

623
00:43:58,424 --> 00:43:59,467
Not even to me?

624
00:44:01,177 --> 00:44:02,846
Not even to you sir.

625
00:44:03,054 --> 00:44:04,054
If you don't mind.

626
00:44:07,642 --> 00:44:11,396
- Alright, but don't keep
it to yourself too long.

627
00:44:12,313 --> 00:44:14,732
Two or three days, no more.

628
00:44:14,941 --> 00:44:15,941
That's a deal.

629
00:44:34,335 --> 00:44:35,628
Hello.

630
00:44:35,837 --> 00:44:37,255
Is Max Lindt there please?

631
00:44:37,463 --> 00:44:39,132
Max Lindt you say?

632
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:43,428
No, I haven't seen him for,
at least since last April.

633
00:44:43,636 --> 00:44:45,221
I see, thank you.

634
00:44:50,852 --> 00:44:52,562
Eric Schurre.

635
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:54,272
Care of Super Fun Fair.

636
00:45:15,168 --> 00:45:16,961
You really can shoot can't you?

637
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:18,170
How much?

638
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:19,380
One mark.

639
00:45:19,589 --> 00:45:20,924
Here.

640
00:45:21,132 --> 00:45:22,508
Keep the change.

641
00:45:22,717 --> 00:45:23,717
Huh?

642
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,760
Do you know Eric Schurre?

643
00:45:24,761 --> 00:45:27,347
No, Why?

644
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:30,016
Where is he?

645
00:45:42,445 --> 00:45:43,655
What do you want?

646
00:45:43,863 --> 00:45:46,157
- You've got quite a guilty
conscience haven't you?

647
00:45:47,784 --> 00:45:48,784
Well?

648
00:45:50,495 --> 00:45:51,829
I'm looking for Max Lindt.

649
00:45:52,997 --> 00:45:54,499
Never heard of him.

650
00:45:54,707 --> 00:45:57,502
- Don't start that or I'll
slap you straight into jail.

651
00:45:57,710 --> 00:45:58,711
What for?

652
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,839
- Corrupting a juvenile,
that'll do for a start.

653
00:46:02,048 --> 00:46:03,883
But I don't know anything.

654
00:46:05,468 --> 00:46:06,844
You know Max Lindt,

655
00:46:07,887 --> 00:46:09,347
and you know where he lives

656
00:46:09,555 --> 00:46:12,433
and you better tell me or
I'll make you wish you had.

657
00:46:12,642 --> 00:46:13,642
Don't touch me,

658
00:46:13,842 --> 00:46:15,812
don't touch me or I'll
tell it to the newspapers.

659
00:46:17,814 --> 00:46:18,940
Tell anyone you like.

660
00:46:53,683 --> 00:46:57,603
Hello, Hotel Monopol.

661
00:46:57,812 --> 00:47:00,148
And don't you call anybody understand?

662
00:47:10,116 --> 00:47:11,701
- Good morning,
looking for something?

663
00:47:11,909 --> 00:47:13,161
Yes, Max Lindt.

664
00:47:13,369 --> 00:47:14,746
Max Lindt?

665
00:47:14,954 --> 00:47:15,954
He's not here.

666
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,127
That way sir.

667
00:47:21,335 --> 00:47:22,962
First floor, room five.

668
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:25,923
And don't tell him I'm coming.

669
00:47:26,132 --> 00:47:27,383
Oh no sir.

670
00:47:51,282 --> 00:47:52,700
Get dressed and come with me.

671
00:48:02,627 --> 00:48:03,627
It's yours.

672
00:48:14,013 --> 00:48:15,807
You left it under Muller's dead body.

673
00:48:20,561 --> 00:48:21,561
Now give it back.

674
00:48:37,829 --> 00:48:39,497
Now pick it up and give it to me,

675
00:48:40,414 --> 00:48:41,707
and don't try that again.

676
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:54,720
A silver dollar with a bullet in it.

677
00:48:54,929 --> 00:48:55,930
What happened?

678
00:48:56,139 --> 00:48:57,181
It save your life?

679
00:48:59,684 --> 00:49:01,144
Brought me luck a few times.

680
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:04,897
Well this time, it'll send you to jail.

681
00:49:05,106 --> 00:49:06,941
For about 200 years.

682
00:49:10,111 --> 00:49:11,237
What for?

683
00:49:11,445 --> 00:49:13,990
Muller, Kaufman, Reinhardt, Zol.

684
00:49:14,198 --> 00:49:15,867
Four very efficient murders.

685
00:49:16,075 --> 00:49:18,536
- I thought you were Bulon,
the Narcotics Squad man.

686
00:49:18,744 --> 00:49:20,621
What's murder got to do with you?

687
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:23,791
Depends on the murder and the murderer.

688
00:49:26,043 --> 00:49:28,462
Take this for a start, hashish.

689
00:49:29,964 --> 00:49:34,802
And the man who pays the murderer,
in this case Schouermann,

690
00:49:36,596 --> 00:49:37,596
let's go.

691
00:49:39,307 --> 00:49:41,976
- You know Bulon, I am not
one who likes to be caught.

692
00:50:48,417 --> 00:50:51,379
- I love you
and I can't live without you.

693
00:50:53,214 --> 00:50:54,214
I can't.

694
00:50:56,467 --> 00:50:57,969
Who did the Porsche belong to?

695
00:50:58,177 --> 00:50:59,512
lreni Von Klaus.

696
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,138
I want the truth.

697
00:51:01,347 --> 00:51:02,347
I don't know.

698
00:51:02,431 --> 00:51:03,431
- You've
never heard of Schouermann?

699
00:51:03,432 --> 00:51:04,517
Never I swear.

700
00:51:04,725 --> 00:51:05,725
- You
expect me to believe that?

701
00:51:05,726 --> 00:51:07,103
I'm telling the truth.

702
00:51:07,311 --> 00:51:08,479
- Why
didn't you answer the phone?

703
00:51:08,688 --> 00:51:10,147
I suppose I was asleep.

704
00:51:10,356 --> 00:51:11,356
Asleep, with the phone

705
00:51:11,556 --> 00:51:12,650
ringing in your ear?

706
00:51:12,858 --> 00:51:13,858
Don't you believe me?

707
00:51:14,058 --> 00:51:14,819
I wish I could.

708
00:51:15,027 --> 00:51:16,028
You wish you could.

709
00:51:16,237 --> 00:51:18,489
Well listen to me, I'm not a criminal

710
00:51:18,698 --> 00:51:20,533
and I refused to be treated like one.

711
00:51:20,741 --> 00:51:23,744
I'm too young to be buried
alive and you know it.

712
00:51:23,953 --> 00:51:26,038
Now I'm really going
to get myself a lover.

713
00:51:26,247 --> 00:51:27,247
Where have you been?

714
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:28,290
The Oust De Pavion.

715
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:29,124
You weren't there.

716
00:51:29,324 --> 00:51:29,958
We changed our minds.

717
00:51:30,158 --> 00:51:30,792
Who were you with?

718
00:51:30,992 --> 00:51:32,003
- A school
friend of mine, Maria.

719
00:51:32,211 --> 00:51:33,462
Don't you believe me?

720
00:51:33,671 --> 00:51:34,671
No, you're lying.

721
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:36,132
Who did the Porsche belong to?

722
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,843
lreni Von Klaus.

723
00:51:39,051 --> 00:51:40,052
It's a lie, it's a lie.

724
00:51:40,261 --> 00:51:41,261
A lie!

725
00:51:44,056 --> 00:51:45,056
Hey, what's wrong?

726
00:52:02,408 --> 00:52:03,408
What's the idea?

727
00:52:05,494 --> 00:52:08,039
I want you to, uh, do something for me.

728
00:52:12,209 --> 00:52:13,878
You've done this before.

729
00:52:24,597 --> 00:52:26,223
Morning Inspector.

730
00:52:28,517 --> 00:52:29,727
Good morning.

731
00:52:35,149 --> 00:52:37,360
Bulon just arrived, bad mood.

732
00:52:42,031 --> 00:52:43,031
Come in.

733
00:52:43,866 --> 00:52:44,866
I've been trying to find you

734
00:52:44,867 --> 00:52:46,494
about that information you asked me for.

735
00:52:46,702 --> 00:52:47,870
Yeah.

736
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:50,164
Ireni Von Klaus does have a red Porsche.

737
00:52:51,457 --> 00:52:52,457
You're sure?

738
00:52:52,657 --> 00:52:54,001
Yes, I checked it myself.

739
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:56,212
Ireni Von Klaus lives
at Four Harren Strasse,

740
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,172
the Porsche was parked right outside.

741
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:10,309
I've got a call on the line for you sir.

742
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:12,310
Who is it?

743
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:13,228
He wouldn't say.

744
00:53:14,814 --> 00:53:15,940
Alright, I'll take it.

745
00:53:16,899 --> 00:53:18,526
Here sir.

746
00:53:18,734 --> 00:53:19,734
Yeah.

747
00:53:19,934 --> 00:53:20,568
I found out something.

748
00:53:22,696 --> 00:53:24,698
But you might not like it much.

749
00:53:24,907 --> 00:53:25,907
Well, what is it?

750
00:53:26,107 --> 00:53:28,160
Well, you know the tulips huh?

751
00:53:28,369 --> 00:53:29,912
Come on outwith it.

752
00:53:30,121 --> 00:53:31,122
Come here and I'll you more.

753
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:32,581
Look, I've got something to attend to

754
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:34,250
but I'll see you later.

755
00:53:40,631 --> 00:53:42,091
Lisa!

756
00:53:42,299 --> 00:53:43,426
Yes, what's the matter?

757
00:53:47,346 --> 00:53:48,346
Nothing.

758
00:53:51,016 --> 00:53:53,561
I'm just pleased to see you that's all.

759
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:02,610
Lisa.

760
00:54:04,613 --> 00:54:07,450
I love you, do you realize that?

761
00:54:08,993 --> 00:54:10,744
Then why do you make my life hell?

762
00:54:11,871 --> 00:54:14,832
Checking on me, spying on
me, cross questioning me.

763
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,040
All of the time.

764
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,000
Then why do you tell me lies?

765
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,295
I don't, you imagine it.

766
00:54:24,592 --> 00:54:27,386
- I'm sorry about the
Porsche, really sorry.

767
00:54:29,346 --> 00:54:32,475
I don't know why I was
so sure it was a lie.

768
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:35,394
You mean you checked?

769
00:54:35,603 --> 00:54:36,687
I'm sorry.

770
00:54:36,896 --> 00:54:40,107
I had to, I had to know.

771
00:54:42,693 --> 00:54:44,528
Well now you know don't you.

772
00:54:44,737 --> 00:54:46,655
I'm not such a liar after all.

773
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:48,740
Lisa.

774
00:54:50,409 --> 00:54:51,409
Lisa.

775
00:55:08,844 --> 00:55:09,844
Max Lindt?

776
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:13,098
Oh you Inspector.

777
00:55:13,307 --> 00:55:14,934
But Mr. Lindt's already gone away.

778
00:55:15,142 --> 00:55:17,478
Gone, are you sure?

779
00:55:17,686 --> 00:55:18,686
Sure.

780
00:55:18,886 --> 00:55:19,521
Where?

781
00:55:19,721 --> 00:55:21,607
- I couldn't say, he
didn't leave any address.

782
00:55:23,067 --> 00:55:24,485
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

783
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:44,420
Hello?

784
00:55:44,505 --> 00:55:45,505
Hello Lisa.

785
00:55:45,548 --> 00:55:46,548
Franz what is it?

786
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:48,842
- Now listen, do you
remember what I told you?

787
00:55:49,051 --> 00:55:50,219
You won't go out will you?

788
00:55:50,427 --> 00:55:51,427
Promise.

789
00:55:51,627 --> 00:55:53,347
Well all right, I promise.

790
00:55:53,556 --> 00:55:55,474
And don't open the door to anyone.

791
00:55:55,683 --> 00:55:57,643
All right I won't.

792
00:55:57,851 --> 00:55:58,978
All right.

793
00:55:59,186 --> 00:56:00,186
Good bye.

794
00:56:15,202 --> 00:56:16,829
Good afternoon.

795
00:56:17,037 --> 00:56:18,330
Good afternoon.

796
00:56:20,207 --> 00:56:23,961
I'd like to talk to you about insurance.

797
00:56:24,169 --> 00:56:25,421
Oh really?

798
00:56:25,629 --> 00:56:26,922
Yes, I'm an insurance man.

799
00:56:27,881 --> 00:56:28,881
Don't I look like one?

800
00:56:28,882 --> 00:56:32,928
No, or maybe yes, who knows?

801
00:56:33,971 --> 00:56:36,015
Come in, we'll talk it over.

802
00:56:43,022 --> 00:56:46,233
To tell you the truth

803
00:56:46,442 --> 00:56:49,445
I always thought that
insurance men were rather dull,

804
00:56:49,653 --> 00:56:52,615
and bald, and wore glasses.

805
00:57:01,749 --> 00:57:03,876
Please sit down.
- Thank you.

806
00:57:05,252 --> 00:57:07,546
Now, tell me all about it?

807
00:57:09,256 --> 00:57:14,219
- As a potential customer I
find your behavior very rash.

808
00:57:20,893 --> 00:57:21,893
Rash?

809
00:57:22,603 --> 00:57:23,603
VeFY

810
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:28,067
You open your front door
to a complete stranger

811
00:57:28,275 --> 00:57:29,568
and invite him in.

812
00:57:30,861 --> 00:57:33,656
Even turn your back on him.

813
00:57:33,864 --> 00:57:36,325
Did it never enter your mind
that I might be a thief?

814
00:57:37,326 --> 00:57:38,619
Or maybe even a murderer.

815
00:57:40,162 --> 00:57:41,580
Maybe.

816
00:57:44,917 --> 00:57:46,210
- Good day Inspector,
can I help you sir?

817
00:57:46,418 --> 00:57:48,379
- Yeah, where are
the boys from this stall?

818
00:57:48,587 --> 00:57:49,587
Where are they?

819
00:57:49,787 --> 00:57:50,421
Gone.

820
00:57:50,621 --> 00:57:51,382
Gone?

821
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:52,591
Gone where?

822
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:53,884
They just cleared out.

823
00:57:55,094 --> 00:57:56,094
Thanks.

824
00:57:58,514 --> 00:58:00,557
Let's talk about something more serious.

825
00:58:02,393 --> 00:58:03,644
Insurance?

826
00:58:03,852 --> 00:58:04,852
No.

827
00:58:09,149 --> 00:58:11,860
Tell me who you really are.

828
00:58:12,069 --> 00:58:13,612
I'm not an insurance man?

829
00:58:13,821 --> 00:58:14,821
Oh no.

830
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:18,951
Well, then I guess I'm just a character

831
00:58:19,159 --> 00:58:20,159
who saw you in the street

832
00:58:20,244 --> 00:58:23,247
and who thought how nice
it would be to insure you.

833
00:58:23,455 --> 00:58:26,291
You've got quite a nerve haven't you?

834
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:27,500
Yes.

835
00:58:30,337 --> 00:58:32,256
But we understand each other, don't we?

836
00:58:34,133 --> 00:58:35,342
Would you like a drink?

837
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,760
Why not.

838
00:59:08,333 --> 00:59:09,333
Hello.

839
00:59:09,334 --> 00:59:10,461
Lisa.

840
00:59:10,669 --> 00:59:12,045
Franz again?

841
00:59:12,254 --> 00:59:13,756
You all right darling?

842
00:59:13,964 --> 00:59:15,924
Yes of course I'm all right, why?

843
00:59:16,133 --> 00:59:17,133
No one's there?

844
00:59:18,886 --> 00:59:21,054
No, nobody's come, nobody at all.

845
00:59:21,263 --> 00:59:22,263
You understood?

846
00:59:23,348 --> 00:59:24,850
All right, I understood you.

847
00:59:26,477 --> 00:59:27,519
Yes, goodbye.

848
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:37,988
All right, let's talk about insurance.

849
00:59:56,548 --> 00:59:57,716
You're looking for the Rabbit?

850
00:59:57,925 --> 00:59:58,925
Yes.

851
00:59:59,125 --> 01:00:00,260
I guess you haven't heard the news.

852
01:00:00,469 --> 01:00:02,930
He got run over by a car.

853
01:00:03,138 --> 01:00:04,515
Run over?

854
01:00:04,723 --> 01:00:07,726
But I talked to him only
a couple of hours again?

855
01:00:07,935 --> 01:00:08,935
Hmm.

856
01:00:11,188 --> 01:00:12,188
Is he in hospital?

857
01:00:12,388 --> 01:00:13,105
No, he's dead.

858
01:00:37,631 --> 01:00:38,631
Lisa!

859
01:00:53,772 --> 01:00:54,772
Good morning.

860
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,990
What are you doing here?

861
01:01:03,198 --> 01:01:04,198
Need you ask?

862
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,161
I want to talk you.

863
01:01:09,204 --> 01:01:10,372
Is that your car?

864
01:01:10,581 --> 01:01:12,916
Well get in and drive on
ahead, to the factory.

865
01:01:25,929 --> 01:01:28,515
- Congratulations
on your wife, some woman.

866
01:01:30,309 --> 01:01:32,269
You've seen her?

867
01:01:32,477 --> 01:01:34,521
I met her, yesterday.

868
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:36,064
I don't waste time, you know.

869
01:01:38,358 --> 01:01:40,319
What do you mean you met her?

870
01:01:40,527 --> 01:01:41,778
She didn't go out yesterday.

871
01:01:42,905 --> 01:01:43,947
I went to see her.

872
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,241
She let you in?

873
01:01:47,326 --> 01:01:48,326
I'll say.

874
01:01:49,953 --> 01:01:50,996
What does that mean?

875
01:01:52,414 --> 01:01:54,333
Come on Inspector,

876
01:01:54,541 --> 01:01:57,169
you surely know what
kind of wife you've got

877
01:01:57,377 --> 01:01:58,377
if you want her dead.

878
01:02:00,339 --> 01:02:01,340
Explain yourself.

879
01:02:09,014 --> 01:02:10,432
Very well.

880
01:02:10,641 --> 01:02:12,517
So here we have a young
lady all alone in the house

881
01:02:12,726 --> 01:02:14,561
and maybe just a wee bit bored.

882
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:16,480
Who opens her front door

883
01:02:16,688 --> 01:02:20,984
and finds herself faced
with a handsome, charming,

884
01:02:21,193 --> 01:02:22,486
fairly amusing young fellow,

885
01:02:22,694 --> 01:02:24,237
who's got quite a way with women.

886
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,449
What would you say she does?

887
01:02:27,658 --> 01:02:29,117
Slam the door in his face?

888
01:02:30,202 --> 01:02:33,080
Some women would do just that, I dare say.

889
01:02:33,288 --> 01:02:35,290
But not your wife, believe me.

890
01:02:35,499 --> 01:02:37,960
She invites me, gives me a drink.

891
01:02:38,919 --> 01:02:41,922
Makes me sit down on a nice, soft couch

892
01:02:42,130 --> 01:02:44,967
and when her husband calls
she says there's no one there.

893
01:02:47,636 --> 01:02:49,054
Is that what she did?

894
01:02:49,262 --> 01:02:50,472
Do you have to ask?

895
01:02:52,391 --> 01:02:54,685
It was you who phoned, wasn't it?

896
01:02:56,061 --> 01:02:57,187
You heard what she said.

897
01:02:58,522 --> 01:02:59,940
And then?

898
01:03:00,148 --> 01:03:02,693
Inspector, I'm a gentleman.

899
01:03:02,901 --> 01:03:04,820
You wouldn't want me to tell you anymore.

900
01:03:10,033 --> 01:03:13,745
I told you what to do, now do it.

901
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:25,549
Hello, can I give you a lift?

902
01:03:25,757 --> 01:03:28,760
- No thank you, I never
take lifts from strange men.

903
01:03:28,969 --> 01:03:31,847
- Good girl, I see you're being
more careful than yesterday.

904
01:03:32,806 --> 01:03:35,684
Oh by the way, I've lost
my cigarette lighter,

905
01:03:35,892 --> 01:03:37,310
maybe I left it at your place?

906
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:38,979
No, I don't think so.

907
01:03:39,187 --> 01:03:41,189
We didn't smoke remember.

908
01:03:41,398 --> 01:03:43,650
Where else could I have left it then?

909
01:03:43,859 --> 01:03:46,194
Maybe underneath my couch?

910
01:03:53,744 --> 01:03:54,870
Trying to be smart hmm?

911
01:04:02,252 --> 01:04:05,338
- It's no good beating about
the bush with you is it?

912
01:04:05,547 --> 01:04:06,547
No.

913
01:04:07,466 --> 01:04:08,633
That goes for me too.

914
01:04:10,594 --> 01:04:12,304
Get in, we'll go for a little ride.

915
01:04:20,228 --> 01:04:21,730
Where are you going to take me?

916
01:04:21,938 --> 01:04:23,315
It's a surprise.

917
01:04:45,337 --> 01:04:48,131
Doesn't it give you a thrill to be high?

918
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:52,552
High up like this,
looking down on the world.

919
01:04:58,892 --> 01:05:00,894
For an insurance man, you're
not behaving too well.

920
01:05:05,607 --> 01:05:09,236
- And how do you think
you're behaving madam?

921
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:16,243
Disgracefully.

922
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:19,996
Do you intend to keep it up?

923
01:05:20,205 --> 01:05:21,205
Yes.

924
01:05:34,594 --> 01:05:35,804
Then I warn you,

925
01:05:36,012 --> 01:05:38,849
my behaviors getting worse
and worse from now on.

926
01:05:39,766 --> 01:05:41,810
- Do you mean to tell
me you have no morals?

927
01:05:42,018 --> 01:05:43,603
None whatever, I'm a rat.

928
01:05:45,272 --> 01:05:47,274
And I'm a cat.

929
01:07:25,497 --> 01:07:27,165
What's your name?

930
01:07:27,374 --> 01:07:29,000
I never asked.

931
01:07:29,209 --> 01:07:30,209
Hans Schmidt.

932
01:07:33,255 --> 01:07:34,923
Sounds like a false name.

933
01:07:35,799 --> 01:07:38,343
It is.

934
01:07:41,554 --> 01:07:44,641
- I can't call you Hans
anyway, it's rhymes with Franz.

935
01:07:46,685 --> 01:07:48,895
Call me Max, that better?

936
01:07:50,522 --> 01:07:51,522
Yes Max.

937
01:07:56,778 --> 01:07:58,113
It's late, I must go.

938
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:03,159
Why?

939
01:08:03,368 --> 01:08:06,037
I've got a husband, remember.

940
01:08:06,246 --> 01:08:07,246
Who cares?

941
01:08:07,998 --> 01:08:09,207
No really, I must go.

942
01:08:12,711 --> 01:08:13,711
Don't go.

943
01:08:13,795 --> 01:08:15,297
No really I must.

944
01:08:15,505 --> 01:08:17,590
What are you doing?

945
01:08:17,799 --> 01:08:20,218
Now don't be silly, let me get dressed.

946
01:08:20,427 --> 01:08:21,845
Please, really I've got to go.

947
01:09:17,108 --> 01:09:19,652
I like those red tulips too.

948
01:09:19,861 --> 01:09:22,197
- Well you take your time,
all the time you want.

949
01:09:23,281 --> 01:09:26,034
- All right, just give me two
dozen of the yellow tulips.

950
01:09:26,242 --> 01:09:27,242
All right.

951
01:09:31,539 --> 01:09:32,539
Hello.

952
01:09:33,666 --> 01:09:35,126
Yes Harry, I know.

953
01:09:40,131 --> 01:09:42,008
- Tulips
mean anything to you sir?

954
01:09:42,217 --> 01:09:44,344
Tulips?

955
01:10:13,164 --> 01:10:14,164
Hi.

956
01:10:14,207 --> 01:10:15,207
How's Mrs. Bulon?

957
01:10:17,377 --> 01:10:18,795
Thanks, fine.

958
01:10:19,003 --> 01:10:20,713
That's nice.

959
01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:29,222
From now on, keep away
from her, understand.

960
01:10:31,266 --> 01:10:32,266
Why?

961
01:10:32,267 --> 01:10:33,601
Because it won't be healthy

962
01:10:33,810 --> 01:10:36,855
to keep on making love
to Mrs. Bulon, get me?

963
01:10:37,063 --> 01:10:38,063
You know what?

964
01:10:38,263 --> 01:10:39,190
It's none of your damn business.

965
01:10:42,944 --> 01:10:43,945
Well now.

966
01:10:44,904 --> 01:10:46,990
He still doesn't understand yet?

967
01:10:47,198 --> 01:10:48,491
Boys.

968
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:04,174
Now do you get the message?

969
01:11:04,382 --> 01:11:06,759
Keep away from Mrs. Bulon.

970
01:11:06,968 --> 01:11:07,968
Come on.

971
01:11:11,598 --> 01:11:13,141
Now be a good boy huh?

972
01:11:30,783 --> 01:11:31,784
You want to see me sir?

973
01:11:31,993 --> 01:11:35,079
Oh Bulon, you lock yourself in now huh?

974
01:11:35,288 --> 01:11:39,542
- Yes, well, when I
want a chance to think.

975
01:11:39,751 --> 01:11:40,751
To think?

976
01:11:41,544 --> 01:11:45,381
- Yes, I have to write
a long report tonight.

977
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:47,342
About the Schouermann case?

978
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:48,885
Yes.

979
01:11:49,093 --> 01:11:50,345
Well, what is it?

980
01:11:50,553 --> 01:11:52,055
I need to think about it first.

981
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,141
I'll let you know in the morning.

982
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:58,520
Very well, tomorrow morning.

983
01:12:01,773 --> 01:12:06,069
Bulon, without fail, hmm?

984
01:12:06,277 --> 01:12:07,277
Tomorrow.

985
01:12:29,968 --> 01:12:30,968
Yeah.

986
01:12:31,168 --> 01:12:31,885
It's Max.

987
01:12:32,085 --> 01:12:35,139
Tomorrow then, we'll
make it tomorrow okay?

988
01:12:37,475 --> 01:12:38,643
Didn't you hear?

989
01:12:38,851 --> 01:12:40,520
Hey, it's me.

990
01:12:41,479 --> 01:12:42,605
Yes I heard.

991
01:12:42,814 --> 01:12:43,856
But afterwards I want to see you,

992
01:12:44,065 --> 01:12:45,984
you forgot to give me
back the lucky dollar.

993
01:12:46,192 --> 01:12:48,820
Let's say 11 at the same place.

994
01:12:50,530 --> 01:12:51,530
Alright.

995
01:12:58,830 --> 01:13:02,625
- You really want to marry
me, in spite of everything?

996
01:13:02,834 --> 01:13:05,628
- I love
you and I believe you.

997
01:13:05,837 --> 01:13:08,381
Those people have got
nothing to do with you.

998
01:14:27,502 --> 01:14:28,544
What happened?

999
01:14:28,753 --> 01:14:29,753
Who hit you?

1000
01:14:31,673 --> 01:14:33,966
Some ugly customers with no manners.

1001
01:14:38,429 --> 01:14:40,306
Selling insurance again?

1002
01:14:40,515 --> 01:14:43,434
- They tried
to sell some yarn to me.

1003
01:14:46,646 --> 01:14:48,940
Hell, it nearly did work
as a matter of fact.

1004
01:14:50,608 --> 01:14:52,318
They very nearly had me sold.

1005
01:14:54,028 --> 01:14:55,028
Oh I'm sorry sir.

1006
01:14:56,406 --> 01:14:57,824
Have you been here all night?

1007
01:14:59,075 --> 01:15:00,075
Yeah.

1008
01:15:00,952 --> 01:15:03,246
I uh, I had a lot to do.

1009
01:15:09,335 --> 01:15:13,339
Listen Siegert, I've got an
appointment this morning.

1010
01:15:13,548 --> 01:15:14,590
It's a personal matter.

1011
01:15:15,675 --> 01:15:17,301
If I'm not back by midday

1012
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:20,847
I want you to give that
envelope to Ostermeyer,

1013
01:15:21,055 --> 01:15:22,223
with my regards.

1014
01:15:22,432 --> 01:15:23,975
But I don't understand sir.

1015
01:15:24,183 --> 01:15:25,183
You will.

1016
01:15:30,022 --> 01:15:31,149
See you later.

1017
01:16:32,418 --> 01:16:35,797
- Max, why do you like
to make love on the floor?

1018
01:16:37,799 --> 01:16:41,427
Don't you?

1019
01:16:41,636 --> 01:16:43,513
Give me some of that cigarette.

1020
01:16:44,430 --> 01:16:45,807
This is special.

1021
01:16:46,015 --> 01:16:47,015
I know.

1022
01:16:54,023 --> 01:16:55,023
Thanks.

1023
01:17:07,578 --> 01:17:10,540
You're crazy to bring me here again.

1024
01:17:16,254 --> 01:17:17,630
You're crazy to have come.

1025
01:17:18,798 --> 01:17:19,798
I like danger.

1026
01:17:26,472 --> 01:17:28,015
I must go now.

1027
01:17:28,224 --> 01:17:29,517
Max, don't go.

1028
01:17:29,725 --> 01:17:30,725
I must.

1029
01:17:32,353 --> 01:17:34,230
Today it's me that's got to hurry away.

1030
01:17:35,982 --> 01:17:37,191
I have to see someone.

1031
01:17:40,027 --> 01:17:41,445
It won't take me long though.

1032
01:17:57,086 --> 01:17:58,588
Wait for me?

1033
01:17:58,796 --> 01:18:00,590
Max, now don't be long.

1034
01:18:00,798 --> 01:18:02,341
Half an hour, not more.

1035
01:18:15,521 --> 01:18:16,606
I'll be right back.

1036
01:18:20,902 --> 01:18:21,902
Max?

1037
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,200
Oh Max.

1038
01:19:28,886 --> 01:19:31,013
- Put up your
hands and don't move.

1039
01:19:38,562 --> 01:19:40,356
I always drop the knife by the body,

1040
01:19:40,564 --> 01:19:42,525
you ought to know that by now.

1041
01:19:42,733 --> 01:19:44,068
What knife?

1042
01:19:44,276 --> 01:19:45,276
And what body?

1043
01:19:46,612 --> 01:19:48,197
We had an agreement, didn't we?

1044
01:19:48,406 --> 01:19:49,490
Which you didn't keep.

1045
01:19:50,908 --> 01:19:51,908
If you were going to kill her,

1046
01:19:52,034 --> 01:19:54,161
you'd have done it two days ago, not now.

1047
01:19:55,496 --> 01:19:57,081
Not even you can do it now.

1048
01:19:57,289 --> 01:19:58,289
What do you mean?

1049
01:19:58,290 --> 01:19:59,625
I mean, I know my wife.

1050
01:20:01,252 --> 01:20:04,213
It took her two days
to get into your blood,

1051
01:20:04,422 --> 01:20:05,881
just like she got into mine.

1052
01:20:07,258 --> 01:20:09,135
I've been watching you Max,

1053
01:20:10,094 --> 01:20:12,471
and I know what I'm talking about.

1054
01:20:13,639 --> 01:20:14,682
You're under arrest.

1055
01:20:16,267 --> 01:20:18,769
- You can't do that,
you know what'll happen.

1056
01:20:18,978 --> 01:20:20,438
Yes I know,

1057
01:20:20,646 --> 01:20:22,773
and I'm perfectly happy
to pay what it costs.

1058
01:20:23,941 --> 01:20:25,943
That's something you wouldn't understand.

1059
01:20:28,654 --> 01:20:29,654
Get in.

1060
01:20:37,496 --> 01:20:40,124
We all have to pay in the end you know.

1061
01:20:40,332 --> 01:20:43,127
Everybody has to pay for what they do.

1062
01:20:44,086 --> 01:20:45,463
Speak for yourself!

1063
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:53,720
You're done for.

1064
01:20:55,014 --> 01:20:58,017
You're done for anyway.

1065
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:31,425
- I enclose a full report of
the Harry Schouermann case.

1066
01:21:31,634 --> 01:21:33,385
Which I think you will
find is all you need.

1067
01:21:33,594 --> 01:21:37,056
But before reading it,
kindly do the following.

1068
01:21:57,827 --> 01:21:58,827
Here I am.

1069
01:22:02,331 --> 01:22:04,708
Lisa.

1070
01:22:04,917 --> 01:22:09,797
Lisa!

1071
01:22:33,946 --> 01:22:34,946
Follow me.

1072
01:22:44,248 --> 01:22:45,248
Halt!

1073
01:23:45,392 --> 01:23:47,519
Stop, you're surrounded.

1074
01:24:28,686 --> 01:24:30,479
Harry, Harry!

1075
01:24:32,022 --> 01:24:34,024
Lisa, what are you doing here?

1076
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:36,235
I had to see you.

1077
01:24:36,443 --> 01:24:37,443
Why?

1078
01:24:37,643 --> 01:24:38,696
But Harry, I don't understand.

1079
01:24:40,489 --> 01:24:41,949
Stop acting my dear,

1080
01:24:42,157 --> 01:24:44,118
I know you too well.

1081
01:24:45,828 --> 01:24:47,288
And don't pretend you love me.

1082
01:24:51,125 --> 01:24:52,125
Max.

1083
01:24:53,377 --> 01:24:55,045
I don't know what you mean?

1084
01:24:55,254 --> 01:24:56,254
" No?

1085
01:24:56,454 --> 01:24:58,132
Max Lindt is a professional killer,

1086
01:24:59,174 --> 01:25:02,469
and what's more he
happened to work for me.

1087
01:25:05,347 --> 01:25:07,558
I'll tell you something
else you didn't know.

1088
01:25:08,892 --> 01:25:11,478
It was Bulon who sent Max to see you.

1089
01:26:05,324 --> 01:26:08,994
- Your husband was an
outstanding man Mrs. Bulon,

1090
01:26:09,203 --> 01:26:10,203
to the end.

1091
01:26:18,337 --> 01:26:22,216
 Someone let a tear fall down 

1092
01:26:22,424 --> 01:26:27,304
 What makes the angels cry 

1093
01:26:27,554 --> 01:26:32,518
 It must be you Lisa 

1094
01:26:34,937 --> 01:26:38,440
 Lisa in the night 

1095
01:26:38,649 --> 01:26:43,529
 What makes you so untrue 

1096
01:26:44,113 --> 01:26:48,409
 He waits for you 

1097
01:26:48,617 --> 01:26:53,497
 Lisa 

1098
01:26:56,792 --> 01:27:01,588
 Love became a promise
you never got to keep 

1099
01:27:01,797 --> 01:27:04,675
 Our love was nice, you turned to ice 

1100
01:27:04,883 --> 01:27:09,721
 And you don't even weep 

1101
01:27:09,930 --> 01:27:14,893
 If Lisa had a heart
she never let is show 

1102
01:27:19,898 --> 01:27:24,820
 And now we know Lisa 

1103
01:27:25,028 --> 01:27:28,198
 Oh Lisa, now we know 

1104
01:27:36,331 --> 01:27:41,295
 It must be you Lisa 

1105
01:27:41,503 --> 01:27:43,839
 Oh Lisa 

1106
01:27:44,047 --> 01:27:48,927
 Now we know 

1107
01:27:52,973 --> 01:27:57,769
 He waits for you Lisa 

1108
01:27:57,978 --> 01:27:59,897
 Oh Lisa 

1109
01:28:00,105 --> 01:28:02,483
 Now we know
