1
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,830
Lisa.

2
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,052
Inspector, they found Willy Zol.

3
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,690
Hello Bulon.

4
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,072
So they got Willy Zol as well?

5
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,321
It looks like a professional job.

6
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:09,281
Siegert tells me that, this
is someone you were after hmm?

7
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,831
Yep.

8
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:14,501
Zol was almost our last hope
of a lead to Schouermann.

9
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:15,874
Schouermann again?

10
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,546
Hmm-mm.

11
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,985
Schouermann's behind most things

12
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,092
in the drug world these days.

13
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,635
Including this you think?

14
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,546
100%.

15
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,119
Kaufman and Reinhardt if you remember

16
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,975
were killed in exactly the same way.

17
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,479
Just when we were looking for them.

18
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,606
What?

19
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:36,978
Oh, the Commissioner is here.

20
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,194
Thank you.

21
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,324
Good evening sir.

22
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,535
Didn't you tell me

23
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:49,696
Willy Zol was the one man who might talk?

24
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,781
Yes, and I was right.

25
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,788
He phoned me at home tonight
and said he wanted to see me.

26
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,037
I was waiting for him when
the news came about this.

27
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,417
Waiting for him?

28
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,296
Why didn't you go out and grab him?

29
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:03,627
With all due respect sir,

30
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,586
I could hardly have
known this would happen.

31
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,889
With all due respect to you, Bulon,

32
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,308
you had every reason to expect justice.

33
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,977
Very well sir.

34
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:15,145
I wish you better luck next time.

35
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,316
Let's go.

36
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,270
Goodnight.

37
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,486
Goodnight sir.

38
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,283
Now there's one lead sir.

39
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,076
A man from the beer house down the road

40
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,244
says Zol had a drink there tonight.

41
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,456
You wanna talk to him?

42
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,459
Yeah.

43
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,329
Just a moment.

44
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:41,549
Who's he phoning now?

45
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:43,833
Who do you think?

46
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,259
His wife, of course.

47
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,741
Oh hello darling.

48
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,318
So you've come home finally?

49
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,537
I rang you.

50
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,199
Why didn't you answer?

51
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,747
What?

52
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,574
Oh, I suppose I was asleep.

53
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,793
Asleep?

54
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,536
With the phone ringing in your ear?

55
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,459
So I wasn't asleep.

56
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,712
Maybe I let it ring on
purpose, just to make you mad.

57
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,045
Or maybe I was out, with a lover.

58
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,595
Isn't that what you think?

59
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,264
Go on say it, I'm used to it by now.

60
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,219
Franz, are you still mad?

61
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,530
Bulon, I want to ask
you a very frank question.

62
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,653
What is wrong with you?

63
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,164
What do you mean?

64
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,707
I mean what is wrong with you?

65
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,754
Is it personal?

66
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,463
Bulon, what the devil is eating you?

67
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,969
Lisa.

68
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,181
Lisa.

69
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,374
Are you listening?

70
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,931
Hmm?

71
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,388
I said are you listening to me.

72
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,724
Yes, I'm listening.

73
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:28,942
Look here Bulon,

74
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,527
the Schouermann case has
got to be solved, urgently.

75
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,105
And you are head of
the narcotics division.

76
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:37,192
It all depends on you,
if you are not well...

77
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,410
I'm perfectly well.

78
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,862
Alright, so I expect,

79
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,789
in fact I demand results, and quickly.

80
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,162
Well it's easy to say
that, we're doing all we can.

81
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,084
It isn't enough.

82
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,457
This town has got turned

83
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,415
into a key center of the drug traffic.

84
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:53,634
At the Ministry,

85
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,628
they consider Schouermann
an international scandal

86
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,678
and in all this time, we don't even know

87
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,883
whether we're dealing
with a man or a thing.

88
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,059
One brain or an organization.

89
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,189
You're doing all you can, are you?

90
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,730
But Willy Zol phones you up
and says he wants to talk.

91
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,362
The only man who can really
tell us what we want to know

92
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,820
and you, just sit and wait.

93
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,874
If you had moved, dear old Bulon,

94
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,873
you'd have had Willy
Zol here this morning.

95
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:30,703
Your wife...

96
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,209
My wife was cleared
by the investigation,

97
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,006
completely cleared.

98
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,255
Otherwise, I'd never had married her.

99
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,085
I know but...

100
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,304
But nothing.

101
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,182
Will you excuse me sir?

102
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,260
I have something important to attend to.

103
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,407
We are viewing last nights
round up in Room A sir.

104
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:09,867
Want to see them?

105
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,086
Yep.

106
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,072
The Rabbit.

107
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,320
I haven't seen him around for a long time.

108
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,448
Kruger, you start on him.

109
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,530
And don't be too polite, understand.

110
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,710
Where'd you get her?

111
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,147
We picked her
up from the roulette tables

112
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,833
in Fritz's at three this morning.

113
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,328
I want to talk to her.

114
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,337
Morning Bulon.

115
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,009
Oh hello Mansfeld.

116
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,221
You wanted to see me?

117
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,089
Yeah, yeah, I'd like a word with you.

118
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,308
Get everything on tape.

119
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,457
From the direction of the wound,

120
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,689
I would say the killer's a tall man.

121
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,689
Pretty strong, judged by the
bruise left by the knife hilt.

122
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,021
And that's just about
all we've got to go on.

123
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,856
No fingerprints, nothing.

124
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,075
How about the knife?

125
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,947
Mass produced, like the
raincoat and the gloves.

126
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,575
Cheap stuff anyone could
pick up in a chain store.

127
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,747
What about the beer house?

128
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,326
You followed up on that,
Siegert didn't you?

129
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,250
Yes sir.

130
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,205
We searched the beer house
dry and got exactly nowhere.

131
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,194
The owner says Willy Zol
came in about half past 10

132
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,959
and had a couple of drinks.

133
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,420
He seemed a bit nervous,
but no one spoke to him,

134
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,675
no one came near him.

135
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,651
It was 11 o'clock when he left and.

136
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,773
Is something wrong?

137
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:04,732
Huh?

138
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:05,657
Oh no, no nothing, no.

139
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,734
Sorry Mansfeld, where were we?

140
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:11,288
It was 11 o'clock when Zol
left the beer house Inspector.

141
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,114
- Excuse me.
- What is it?

142
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,619
You wanted to see that girl?

143
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:14,835
Yeah.

144
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:15,877
Any luck with Strauss?

145
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,165
Nothing sir.

146
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,873
Well, we seem to have
drawn blank all round.

147
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:21,878
It seems so for the moment.

148
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,130
- Bring the girl in will you?
- Let me know, sir.

149
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,345
If anything crops up.

150
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,471
I'll keep in touch.

151
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:43,572
Sit there.

152
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:59,169
Lisa.

153
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,135
What's your name?

154
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,554
Marianne.

155
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,472
Marrianne De Lomac.

156
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,265
How old are you?

157
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,513
19.

158
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,014
19.

159
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,595
And you take drugs?

160
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:17,895
No!

161
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,947
Then what were you
doing at Fritz's Roulette?

162
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:20,599
Nothing.

163
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,434
Nothing, you weren't gambling?

164
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:23,313
No.

165
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,315
Who were you with?

166
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,530
Nobody.

167
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,320
Looking for customers eh?

168
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,408
No, I swear.

169
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:32,157
So you weren't gambling,
you weren't getting fixed

170
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,238
and you weren't looking for customers.

171
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,203
But there you were, all alone,

172
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,660
three o'clock in the
morning, doing nothing.

173
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:43,673
Who sent you there?

174
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:47,126
Nobody, nobody sent me.

175
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:48,405
I don't know what you're talking about.

176
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,429
Yes you do.

177
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,303
Somebody sent you to see
Fritz, to fetch something.

178
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:55,477
Now who was it?

179
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,190
You better tell me you know.

180
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:07,989
Right.

181
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,617
Tell me this.

182
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,494
What time did you arrive at Fritz's?

183
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,288
About, about half past two.

184
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:25,497
Siegert.

185
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:26,331
Yes sir.

186
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:27,569
What time was the murder?

187
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,879
Just after 11.

188
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,462
2:15 eh?

189
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:32,842
Yes that fits.

190
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,758
I've got the girl here now.

191
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,094
Says she arrived at Fritz's at 2:30.

192
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:38,927
Huh?

193
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,183
Oh yes, I got it.

194
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,355
No, no no, no alibi at all.

195
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,729
No, she just refuses to talk.

196
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:45,559
Hmm.

197
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,098
Looks as if I have to charge her.

198
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,155
Come on in will you.

199
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,401
I don't know what you're talking about.

200
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,073
There's been a murder Marianne.

201
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:52,900
A murder?

202
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,119
Yeah.

203
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,577
And you know, when we ask people questions

204
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,031
and they don't answer, we get suspicious.

205
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,910
And you've no alibi for quarter past two.

206
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,711
- But I...
- Now unless you can tell me

207
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,162
where you were at quarter
past two, you're going to be...

208
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,457
I was at Ursula's.

209
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,676
Now who's Ursula?

210
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,553
Ursula Stein, a friend of mine.

211
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,804
Will she confirm that?

212
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,020
Of course.

213
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,099
Ursula Stein, huh?

214
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,315
Address?

215
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,524
Sonnet Strasse 23.

216
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,772
When did you leave there?

217
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,564
I don't know, about half past two.

218
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,690
Did you go straight to Fritz's?

219
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,113
Yes.

220
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,324
Did Ursula ask you to?

221
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,529
Yes, no no no, she didn't.

222
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:35,985
Yes she did, why?

223
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,662
Oh god, I don't wanna
get Ursula into trouble.

224
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,206
Does Ursula use the drugs herself?

225
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,794
So she wanted the stuff for someone else?

226
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,005
A man?

227
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,215
Her boyfriend?

228
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,719
Alright Marianne, alright.

229
00:16:56,599 --> 00:17:00,138
Now then, what's Ursula's boyfriends name?

230
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,561
Kurt, Kurt Muller.

231
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,392
Why didn't he go to Fritz's himself?

232
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,443
He can't, they're after him.

233
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,655
Who's they?

234
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,654
Schouermann?

235
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,117
Then why didn't Ursula go?

236
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,452
They know her, they don't know me.

237
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,424
He must have needed
that stuff pretty badly

238
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,037
to send you to Fritz's at
three o'clock in the morning.

239
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:25,252
Where is he now?

240
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:26,747
He's hiding at Ursula's.

241
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,334
Why doesn't he come to us?

242
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,416
He's too scared, you don't
know what they're like.

243
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,718
And anyway, maybe he's done something bad.

244
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,012
They used to make him see.

245
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,805
He's hooked on that stuff.

246
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:39,756
The cocaine?

247
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,512
So he couldn't say no.

248
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,595
Oh god, oh god, they'll kill me for this.

249
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:47,774
Don't worry.

250
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,229
For the time being we're
going to keep you here.

251
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,188
I'm under arrest?

252
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,193
No, no.

253
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,491
Not now you've explained things to us.

254
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,864
But you'll be safer here.

255
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,079
No, no.

256
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,205
Your wife is here.

257
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,533
Here?

258
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,958
- Hello.
- Hello.

259
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,006
May I come in.

260
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,083
Yes, yes come in.

261
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,303
Kruger.

262
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,133
Please come with me.

263
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,436
Well, aren't you happy to see me?

264
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,138
Of course I'm happy to see you.

265
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,519
Listen darling, I need some money.

266
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:33,022
I feel like buying something
wildly extravagant.

267
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:34,988
How much?

268
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,829
That'll do thank you.

269
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,499
Lisa.

270
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,496
Hmm?

271
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,168
I tried to call you, you were out.

272
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,211
Of course, I was on my way here.

273
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,539
Where are you going now?

274
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,044
To spend your money.

275
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,091
First of all I want to buy a walkie talkie

276
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,295
so you can keep track of me wherever I go.

277
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,095
Jealous.

278
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,101
Come in.

279
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:07,936
Oh good morning Mrs. Bulon.

280
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,763
- Hello.
- Kurt Muller, Ursula Stein.

281
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:10,982
Excuse me.

282
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,858
Something to work on at last.

283
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,403
Work, work, that's all you do.

284
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:26,576
Lisa, look I'm sorry, but I'm very busy.

285
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,000
Alright, I have things to do too.

286
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,873
- Lisa...
- Goodbye darling.

287
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:40,711
Kurt Muller, here's somebody
who can tell us something.

288
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,010
He's hiding out for the
moment at Sonnet Strasse, 23,

289
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,969
with his girlfriend Ursula Stein.

290
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:57,815
Where is Muller?

291
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,146
Where has he gone?

292
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,365
I don't know.

293
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,367
Liar.

294
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,944
We said where is he?

295
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,244
Out with it.

296
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,071
I don't know.

297
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,434
You don't know
where your own boyfriend is?

298
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,074
I don't see him anymore.

299
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,296
Alright you
bitch, you're coming with us.

300
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:18,508
Move.

301
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:23,029
Where's Muller?

302
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,277
How do you know they didn't take him too?

303
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,700
It was the only the girl.

304
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:29,119
The woman downstairs saw her
being dragged out to a car

305
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,411
by three thugs.

306
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,080
Muller must have gotten away.

307
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,953
I'd just like to know how it is,

308
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,888
that every time I start
looking for somebody

309
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,494
they get there first.

310
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,330
Damn it Siegert, nobody knew
about this but you and me.

311
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,718
It was probably a coincidence.

312
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,388
There have been too many
damn coincidences lately.

313
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:56,813
Listen Siegert, we've got to
find Muller before they do.

314
00:21:58,984 --> 00:21:59,984
Is that clear?

315
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,152
Yes sir.

316
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,754
Hey, you want the latest news?

317
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:24,709
Yeah, but not that sort.

318
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,920
Sorry, no change.

319
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,138
Nevermind.

320
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,265
Alright.

321
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:36,512
What do you wanna know Inspector?

322
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,471
Where to find a man called Muller?

323
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:39,691
Muller?

324
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:40,390
Kurt Muller.

325
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,975
Take the money, I don't want it.

326
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,195
Anything else?

327
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:47,989
There was one thing
I wanted to tell you.

328
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,907
Weird, pretty strange.

329
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,868
Tulips mean anything to you sir?

330
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,618
Tulips?

331
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:58,200
Could be that it was
only a stupid, little joke.

332
00:22:58,419 --> 00:22:59,660
But I don't let anything go.

333
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:03,797
Last week or so, I've
heard a lot about flowers.

334
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,419
Tulips yeah.

335
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,968
I don't know, but that's
the story on the street.

336
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,181
Well it's not much to go on,

337
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,760
but try and find out some
more and let me know, okay.

338
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:18,971
You know me Inspector, see you.

339
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,189
Hmm.

340
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:33,745
Hi Olaf.

341
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:35,788
Hi Max.

342
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,098
Not gonna count it?

343
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:55,308
No, I trust you.

344
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:59,011
Now let's shake hands and call it quits.

345
00:23:59,229 --> 00:23:59,935
I'm buying myself

346
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,605
a very expensive plane
ticket in the morning.

347
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,058
Hey wait, they've got
one more job to be done.

348
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,313
Oh no, not for me.

349
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,986
Three jobs is plenty as
far as I'm concerned.

350
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:15,327
One more, one less,
what's the difference?

351
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,245
How often do you think a
man can get away with murder?

352
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,789
I've been lucky.

353
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,161
I wanna stay lucky.

354
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,994
You don't understand Max,
there isn't much choice.

355
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,831
What do you mean?

356
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:31,794
You wanna go away, not tomorrow.

357
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,799
Go the day after tomorrow.

358
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,014
Take my advice.

359
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,841
If you wanna be around
to catch that plane,

360
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,392
well then do what I tell you.

361
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,024
Want it?

362
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,352
Who is it?

363
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,221
His name is Kurt Muller.

364
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:39,452
Lisa.

365
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:42,707
Lisa?

366
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,481
Darling,
I called the office

367
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,801
but you were not there.

368
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,886
I've gone to supper at Oust De Pavion

369
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,846
with a school friend of mine.

370
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,066
Love Lisa.

371
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,890
Good evening sir, may I help you?

372
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,482
Would you like a table?

373
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,701
No thank you.

374
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:19,947
Very well sir.

375
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,913
Do you happen to have seen a young lady

376
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,128
wearing a white coat?

377
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,796
Yes, yes beautiful.

378
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,967
She came in, looked
around, then she went out.

379
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:39,467
Got back into her car and drove away.

380
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:42,181
Her car?

381
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,975
Yes sir, a beautiful red Porsche.

382
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,230
Thanks.

383
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,924
Why don't you look out, bastard!

384
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,239
Did he call?

385
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,323
No.

386
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:43,489
Muller will show up, don't worry.

387
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:45,445
He can't do without his snow.

388
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,751
- Hello boys.
- Alright Fritz.

389
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:58,301
Yes.

390
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:00,593
Hello Muller.

391
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:01,804
What'd I tell you?

392
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,634
That Muller's a fool.

393
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:04,849
Yes.

394
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,096
No, you can't come here,
we're being watched.

395
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,312
Who by?

396
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,063
By everyone.

397
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,101
Yes, I understand.

398
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,351
Okay, listen to me.

399
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,360
Go to New Valley Strasse number three.

400
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:23,783
At one o'clock, got that?

401
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,576
Great, contact Max.

402
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:26,787
Yes, one o'clock.

403
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:31,995
Not before or you won't
find anything, understand.

404
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,248
Walk in the entrance

405
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,793
and on the left you'll
find some letter boxes.

406
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:40,216
Look for the one with
the name Weiner on it.

407
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,427
It won't be locked.

408
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,304
Open it.

409
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,364
Hello darling, you gave me a fright.

410
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,236
Where have you been?

411
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,443
Why, didn't you find my note?

412
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:49,903
Yes, I found it.

413
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:52,205
And I went to the Oust
De Pavion restaurant.

414
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,574
You weren't there.

415
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,229
I don't know what you're
trying to insinuate,

416
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:59,041
or why I have to justify
every step I take.

417
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,669
But all the same, I'm going to tell you

418
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:05,172
exactly why you didn't find
me at the Oust De Pavion.

419
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:08,471
I arrived ahead of
time, Maria hadn't come.

420
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:11,345
So I went to pick her up at her hotel,

421
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,662
and then we changed our minds

422
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:14,302
and had dinner sent up to her room.

423
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,603
Are you satisfied now Mr. Policeman?

424
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,606
And who did the Porsche belong to?

425
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:28,743
What?

426
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,406
Who did the Porsche belong to?

427
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,447
Oh god, you're unbearable.

428
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,578
Can't you ever stop grilling people?

429
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,785
You haven't answered my question.

430
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,417
Who did the Porsche belong to?

431
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,747
I want the truth.

432
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,707
To Ireni Von Klaus, how about that?

433
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,669
You know where Ireni
Von Klaus is don't you?

434
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:51,472
She's the President of the
Internode German Association

435
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,970
and she committed the
crime of giving me a life.

436
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,181
What's the matter?

437
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,397
Don't you believe me?

438
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,233
I wish I could.

439
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:02,979
You wish you could.

440
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:06,609
Listen to me, you may spend
your days bullying people,

441
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,860
beating them up, making little girls cry

442
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:11,284
but you can't do it at
home, you understand?

443
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:15,163
I'm not a criminal and I
refuse to be treated like one.

444
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:17,661
I've had enough.

445
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,002
So what are you gonna do?

446
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,214
Leave me?

447
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,127
What do you expect me to do?

448
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:28,300
Keep paying all my life for one mistake?

449
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,757
What mistake was that?

450
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,964
Making friends with Reinhardt?

451
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:36,267
I knew you'd drag that up again.

452
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,094
That was a big crime wasn't it?

453
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,930
It was big mistake, and
it nearly sent you to jail.

454
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:41,764
Jail?

455
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,144
I am in jail.

456
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,020
I can't go out,

457
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,319
you don't want me to see
anybody or do anything.

458
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:49,238
All you want me to do
is sit home and wait.

459
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:52,692
Well I'm too young to be
buried alive, and you know it.

460
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,870
You just can't believe
I'm faithful can you?

461
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,248
Well I'm going to teach
you a lesson Mr. Bulon.

462
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,917
Now I'm really going
to get myself a lover.

463
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,756
Don't you touch me.

464
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:46,125
Tulips
mean anything to you sir?

465
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,419
Tulips?

466
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,596
Hello sir.

467
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:56,807
Who is it?

468
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,512
Siegert here.

469
00:32:58,727 --> 00:32:59,727
They killed Muller.

470
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:02,849
Hello?

471
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,064
Hello sir?

472
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,641
Do you hear me?

473
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,351
Yes I heard.

474
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,651
They've killed Muller.

475
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:21,823
- Max.
- Hi Greta.

476
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,423
Clever boy.

477
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,005
Today's Tuesday.

478
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,716
You don't say?

479
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:40,935
What does it mean?

480
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:45,437
It means, it means that I'm free.

481
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:47,106
I'm not singing tonight.

482
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:48,979
Thank god.

483
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:52,232
Max, don't be nasty.

484
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,029
You know what I mean.

485
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:55,357
That I can stay with you.

486
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,071
Who says I want to stay with you?

487
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,079
Don't you?

488
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:03,622
Well, after all it's
not such a bad idea.

489
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,290
Hmm.

490
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,209
It's too crowded here.

491
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,416
Come on, let's have scotches.
- Alright.

492
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,922
- Good evening.
- Two scotches.

493
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,510
Right away.

494
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,682
Two scotches.
- Thank you.

495
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:29,690
That watch right?

496
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,254
Yes sir, always right to the second.

497
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:32,735
Then mine's fast.

498
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:34,822
6 marks sir.

499
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:39,868
What's happened?

500
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:41,787
Lose something?

501
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,187
Looks like this is up your street again.

502
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:13,563
Same technique, Herr Doctor.

503
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,270
Wounds look exactly
like Zol's, identical.

504
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,697
And he had this, sir, in his hand.

505
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:19,568
What is it?

506
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,820
Cocaine?

507
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,036
What do you think?

508
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,911
Bicarbonate of soda.

509
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,539
Send this down to the
lab and get it checked.

510
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:31,915
Yes sir.

511
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,462
See you tomorrow Bulon.

512
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:39,885
Little bicarbonate of
soda in a letterbox eh?

513
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,804
Well it's quite a neat little trick.

514
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,383
They took the girls so he
had to fetch it himself.

515
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:48,762
The idiot.

516
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,346
He must have phoned someone.

517
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,607
Yeah.

518
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:54,818
Maybe Fritz?

519
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:56,401
Don't you think it's time

520
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,320
we did something about Fritz, Inspector?

521
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:00,699
Yeah.

522
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:09,032
Herr Siegert, I want you to find out

523
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:13,164
if somebody called Ireni
Von Klaus has a red Porsche?

524
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,416
Who?

525
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:15,631
Ireni Von Klaus?

526
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,834
Yes Ireni Von Klaus.

527
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:22,420
I want to know if she has a red Porsche!

528
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,251
Who is it?

529
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:16,954
It's me Max.

530
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,170
Let me in.

531
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:23,423
What the devil?

532
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:24,295
At this hour, are you crazy?

533
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:27,379
I've lost, my lucky dollar.

534
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:30,474
You don't say.

535
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:35,136
Is that the end of world?

536
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:36,391
Yes, for me it is.

537
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,648
Well, I haven't got it.

538
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:42,109
I had it this evening, I know I did.

539
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,320
I was sitting here.

540
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:47,030
Maybe you lost it
somewhere else, so what?

541
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,824
So I'm superstitious okay.

542
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:50,869
So what?

543
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:54,743
That dollar brought
me luck, now it's gone.

544
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:55,958
I'm scared.

545
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:00,460
This last job was one too
many, I told you so, I knew it.

546
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,664
Nobody's luck holds out forever

547
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,418
and mine's gone now, I feel it.

548
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:08,131
If I don't find that lucky dollar tonight,

549
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:08,961
I'm getting out.

550
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,297
I'm getting out so fast you won't see me.

551
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:12,516
Are you finished?

552
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,186
Now listen boy, you're in it.

553
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:20,390
Will you cram it into your
head once and for all.

554
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,225
Schouermann couldn't care
less about your lucky dollar.

555
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,695
To hell with Schouermann
and with you too.

556
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,369
Morning Inspector.

557
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,201
Good morning sir.

558
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:39,909
Siegert, did you find
out about the Porsche?

559
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,994
- The Porsche?
- Yes the Porsche.

560
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,329
Oh yes, I'm sorry.

561
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:46,211
With all this business, I'll
go and check it right away.

562
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:50,429
- Heinz.
- Yes sir.

563
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,113
Send someone up from the lab will you?

564
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,756
Right away.

565
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,935
Come in.

566
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:01,230
Morning sir, I brought some coffee.

567
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:02,441
Thanks.

568
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,360
Kruger.

569
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:10,026
Do tulips mean anything to you?

570
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,358
- Tulips?
- Yes.

571
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:15,365
Yellow tulips, do they
mean anything to you?

572
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:20,036
I don't know sir, I really couldn't say.

573
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,080
Why?

574
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,296
You onto something?

575
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:27,923
Oh who knows.

576
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,404
How are you?

577
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:51,615
I'm fine.

578
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Come in.

579
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:04,584
Sir?

580
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:05,411
Check this for prints

581
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,149
and have it brought back
to me personally will you?

582
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,173
Yes sir.

583
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,472
I want to see all the film
shot in the waiting room

584
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:18,800
over the past year.

585
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:19,633
All of them?

586
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:20,638
All of them.

587
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,266
He's gonna be here for hours.

588
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,499
What date's this?

589
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:47,419
Around approximately,
March, just a year ago.

590
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:53,834
This is April coming up now.

591
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:07,936
Get me the files on those two.

592
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:12,110
Have you finished sir?

593
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,607
Yes thanks. for the moment.

594
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:19,786
Good morning Bulon.

595
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:20,618
Good morning sir.

596
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:21,830
You look worried,

597
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:23,718
as a matter of fact I
was coming to see you.

598
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:26,033
So we've had another killing huh?

599
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,252
Yep.

600
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:30,295
Someone I was looking for, as usual.

601
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,292
What?

602
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,715
I never even knew Muller
existed until yesterday.

603
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,542
Then I started looking for him

604
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:38,220
and in a matter of hours he got stabbed.

605
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:39,797
Did you let the girl go?

606
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:41,973
No, she's still here.

607
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:44,142
That's what worries me.

608
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:47,471
How many people knew about this?

609
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,897
Very few.

610
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,270
Let's go into your office.

611
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,873
Excuse me, I brought
those files you asked for.

612
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:12,089
Oh thank you.

613
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:15,175
Who are they?

614
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,126
Eric Schurre, he's just a lead.

615
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:21,089
It's his friend I'm after, Max Lindt.

616
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,383
Mind you, it's only a hunch no more.

617
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,969
This time, I'm gonna handle it myself.

618
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,100
Max Lindt, the one from Marseilles.

619
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,312
No police record.

620
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:35,611
No, he was caught in a round up

621
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:37,438
a few months ago by mistake,

622
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:39,193
or so he had us believe.

623
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,946
But I remember him because
of a funny trick he had

624
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,118
of playing with something in his hand

625
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,787
all the time, like this.

626
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,373
He was very nervous too.

627
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,123
You haven't told me
why you're after him?

628
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,955
Well I told you sir, it's only a hunch.

629
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,791
For the moment I'd rather
not tell you any more.

630
00:43:58,719 --> 00:43:59,755
Not even to me?

631
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,134
Not even to you sir.

632
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,349
If you don't mind.

633
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:11,681
Alright, but don't keep
it to yourself too long.

634
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,021
Two or three days, no more.

635
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:16,236
That's a deal.

636
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,916
Hello.

637
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:37,543
Is Max Lindt there please?

638
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,420
Max Lindt you say?

639
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:43,720
No, I haven't seen him for,
at least since last April.

640
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,513
I see, thank you.

641
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:52,854
Eric Schurre.

642
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,556
Care of Super Fun Fair.

643
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:17,250
You really can shoot can't you?

644
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:18,080
How much?

645
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:19,665
One mark.

646
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,216
Here.

647
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,793
Keep the change.

648
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:24,012
Huh?

649
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:24,841
Do you know Eric Schurre?

650
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:27,639
No, why?

651
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:30,301
Where is he?

652
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,947
What do you want?

653
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,445
You've got quite a guilty
conscience haven't you?

654
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,079
Well?

655
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,122
I'm looking for Max Lindt.

656
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,783
Never heard of him.

657
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,790
Don't start that or I'll
slap you straight into jail.

658
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,005
What for?

659
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:02,128
Corrupting a juvenile,
that'll do for a start.

660
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:04,175
But I don't know anything.

661
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,129
You know Max Lindt,

662
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,639
and you know where he lives

663
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,718
and you better tell me or
I'll make you wish you had.

664
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:13,552
Don't touch me,

665
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,104
don't touch me or I'll
tell it to the newspapers.

666
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:19,225
Tell anyone you like.

667
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:57,892
Hello, Hotel Monopol.

668
00:46:58,107 --> 00:47:00,440
And don't you call anybody understand?

669
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:12,180
Good morning,
looking for something?

670
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,445
Yes, Max Lindt.

671
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,030
Max Lindt?

672
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:16,249
He's not here.

673
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,411
That way sir.

674
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,246
First floor, room five.

675
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:26,403
And don't tell him I'm coming.

676
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:27,668
Oh no sir.

677
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,988
Get dressed and come with me.

678
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:03,922
It's yours.

679
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,095
You left it under Muller's dead body.

680
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:21,856
Now give it back.

681
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:39,786
Now pick it up and give it to me,

682
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:41,995
and don't try that again.

683
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:55,013
A silver dollar with a bullet in it.

684
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:56,224
What happened?

685
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:57,470
It save your life?

686
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:01,436
Brought me luck a few times.

687
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:05,182
Well this time, it'll send you to jail.

688
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:07,233
For about 200 years.

689
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:11,522
What for?

690
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,278
Muller, Kaufman, Reinhardt, Zol.

691
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,155
Four very efficient murders.

692
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,828
I thought you were Bulon,
the Narcotics Squad man.

693
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,905
What's murder got to do with you?

694
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:24,084
Depends on the murder and the murderer.

695
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,751
Take this for a start, hashish.

696
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:35,095
And the man who pays the murderer,
in this case Schouermann,

697
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:37,891
let's go.

698
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:42,265
You know Bulon, I am not
one who likes to be caught.

699
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,671
I love you
and I can't live without you.

700
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:54,509
I can't.

701
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,253
Who did the Porsche belong to?

702
00:50:58,472 --> 00:50:59,872
Ireni Von Klaus.

703
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,495
I want the truth.

704
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:02,642
I don't know.

705
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:03,512
You've
never heard of Schouermann?

706
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:04,808
Never I swear.

707
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:05,806
You
expect me to believe that?

708
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,582
I'm telling the truth.

709
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:08,959
Why
didn't you answer the phone?

710
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:10,627
I suppose I was asleep.

711
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:11,391
Asleep, with the phone

712
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:12,942
ringing in your ear?

713
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:13,768
Don't you believe me?

714
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,298
I wish I could.

715
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,322
You wish you could.

716
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:18,774
Well listen to me, I'm not a criminal

717
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:20,825
and I refused to be treated like one.

718
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:24,029
I'm too young to be buried
alive and you know it.

719
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:26,331
Now I'm really going
to get myself a lover.

720
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:27,561
Where have you been?

721
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:28,200
The Oust De Pavion.

722
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:29,034
You weren't there.

723
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:29,868
We changed our minds.

724
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:30,702
Who were you with?

725
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,482
A school
friend of mine, Maria.

726
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:33,747
Don't you believe me?

727
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:35,110
No, you're lying.

728
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:36,420
Who did the Porsche belong to?

729
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,127
Ireni Von Klaus.

730
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,532
It's a lie, it's a lie.

731
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:41,262
A lie!

732
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:45,351
Hey, what's wrong?

733
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:03,703
What's the idea?

734
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,327
I want you to, uh, do something for me.

735
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,166
You've done this before.

736
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:26,508
Morning Inspector.

737
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,019
Good morning.

738
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:37,652
Bulon just arrived, bad mood.

739
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:43,326
Come in.

740
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:44,947
I've been trying to find you

741
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,778
about that information you asked me for.

742
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,158
Yeah.

743
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:50,457
Ireni Von Klaus does have a red Porsche.

744
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:52,367
You're sure?

745
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,293
Yes, I checked it myself.

746
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:56,497
Ireni Von Klaus lives
at Four Harren Strasse,

747
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,456
the Porsche was parked right outside.

748
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,597
I've got a call on the line for you sir.

749
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:12,311
Who is it?

750
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:13,523
He wouldn't say.

751
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:16,225
Alright, I'll take it.

752
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,810
Here sir.

753
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:19,644
Yeah.

754
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:20,863
I found out something.

755
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,983
But you might not like it much.

756
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:25,908
Well, what is it?

757
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,453
Well, you know the tulips huh?

758
00:53:28,664 --> 00:53:30,200
Come on out with it.

759
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:31,601
Come here and I'll you more.

760
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,061
Look, I've got something to attend to

761
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:34,542
but I'll see you later.

762
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:42,383
Lisa!

763
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:43,710
Yes, what's the matter?

764
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:48,641
Nothing.

765
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,849
I'm just pleased to see you that's all.

766
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:02,905
Lisa.

767
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,742
I love you, do you realize that?

768
00:54:09,288 --> 00:54:11,029
Then why do you make my life hell?

769
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:15,125
Checking on me, spying on
me, cross questioning me.

770
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,075
All of the time.

771
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:17,035
Then why do you tell me lies?

772
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,587
I don't, you imagine it.

773
00:54:24,887 --> 00:54:27,675
I'm sorry about the
Porsche, really sorry.

774
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:32,759
I don't know why I was
so sure it was a lie.

775
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:35,686
You mean you checked?

776
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:36,979
I'm sorry.

777
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:40,400
I had to, I had to know.

778
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,820
Well now you know don't you.

779
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:46,944
I'm not such a liar after all.

780
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:49,035
Lisa.

781
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:51,704
Lisa.

782
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,139
Max Lindt?

783
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:13,387
Oh you Inspector.

784
00:55:13,602 --> 00:55:15,218
But Mr. Lindt's already gone away.

785
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,770
Gone, are you sure?

786
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:18,596
Sure.

787
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:19,431
Where?

788
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,892
I couldn't say, he
didn't leave any address.

789
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:24,773
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

790
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:44,715
Hello?

791
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:45,800
Hello Lisa.

792
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:46,843
Franz what is it?

793
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:49,127
Now listen, do you
remember what I told you?

794
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:50,507
You won't go out will you?

795
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:51,337
Promise.

796
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:53,640
Well all right, I promise.

797
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:55,763
And don't open the door to anyone.

798
00:55:55,978 --> 00:55:57,935
All right I won't.

799
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,262
All right.

800
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:00,481
Goodbye.

801
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:17,113
Good afternoon.

802
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:18,618
Good afternoon.

803
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:24,246
I'd like to talk to you about insurance.

804
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,705
Oh really?

805
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,210
Yes, I'm an insurance man.

806
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:28,962
Don't I look like one?

807
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:33,217
No, or maybe yes, who knows?

808
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:36,303
Come in, we'll talk it over.

809
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:46,526
To tell you the truth

810
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:49,730
I always thought that
insurance men were rather dull,

811
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:52,907
and bald, and wore glasses.

812
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:04,161
Please sit down.
- Thank you.

813
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,834
Now, tell me all about it?

814
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:14,512
As a potential customer I
find your behavior very rash.

815
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:22,188
Rash?

816
00:57:22,898 --> 00:57:23,898
Very.

817
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:28,359
You open your front door
to a complete stranger

818
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:29,856
and invite him in.

819
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,944
Even turn your back on him.

820
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:36,617
Did it never enter your mind
that I might be a thief?

821
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:38,907
Or maybe even a murderer.

822
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,868
Maybe.

823
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:46,689
Good day Inspector,
can I help you sir?

824
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,713
Yeah, where are
the boys from this stall?

825
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:49,497
Where are they?

826
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:50,331
Gone.

827
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:51,666
Gone?

828
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:52,885
Gone where?

829
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:54,176
They just cleared out.

830
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:56,389
Thanks.

831
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:00,846
Let's talk about something more serious.

832
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:03,929
Insurance?

833
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,147
No.

834
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:12,152
Tell me who you really are.

835
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:13,900
I'm not an insurance man?

836
00:58:14,116 --> 00:58:15,116
Oh no.

837
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:19,243
Well, then I guess I'm just a character

838
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:20,454
who saw you in the street

839
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:23,532
and who thought how nice
it would be to insure you.

840
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:26,584
You've got quite a nerve haven't you?

841
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:27,795
Yes.

842
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:32,544
But we understand each other, don't we?

843
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:35,635
Would you like a drink?

844
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,055
Why not.

845
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:09,414
Hello.

846
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:10,745
Lisa.

847
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:12,330
Franz again?

848
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,040
You all right darling?

849
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:16,216
Yes of course I'm all right, why?

850
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:17,428
No one's there?

851
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:21,343
No, nobody's come, nobody at all.

852
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:22,558
You understood?

853
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:25,134
All right, I understood you.

854
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:27,808
Yes, goodbye.

855
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:38,273
All right, let's talk about insurance.

856
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,123
You're looking for the Rabbit?

857
00:59:58,220 --> 00:59:58,835
Yes.

858
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:00,545
I guess you haven't heard the news.

859
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:03,222
He got run over by a car.

860
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,799
Run over?

861
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:08,011
But I talked to him only
a couple of hours again?

862
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:09,230
Hmm.

863
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:12,189
Is he in hospital?

864
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,400
No, he's dead.

865
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:38,926
Lisa!

866
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:55,067
Good morning.

867
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:03,282
What are you doing here?

868
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:04,493
Need you ask?

869
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,455
I want to talk you.

870
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:10,660
Is that your car?

871
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:13,209
Well get in and drive on
ahead, to the factory.

872
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:28,807
Congratulations
on your wife, some woman.

873
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:32,561
You've seen her?

874
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:34,809
I met her, yesterday.

875
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:36,357
I don't waste time, you know.

876
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:40,610
What do you mean you met her?

877
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:42,063
She didn't go out yesterday.

878
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,236
I went to see her.

879
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,535
She let you in?

880
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:48,621
I'll say.

881
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:51,284
What does that mean?

882
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,621
Come on Inspector,

883
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:57,453
you surely know what
kind of wife you've got

884
01:01:57,672 --> 01:01:58,672
if you want her dead.

885
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:01,634
Explain yourself.

886
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:10,720
Very well.

887
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:12,936
So here we have a young
lady all alone in the house

888
01:02:13,021 --> 01:02:14,853
and maybe just a wee bit bored.

889
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:16,772
Who opens her front door

890
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:21,273
and finds herself faced
with a handsome, charming,

891
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:22,774
fairly amusing young fellow,

892
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:24,525
who's got quite a way with women.

893
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:27,737
What would you say she does?

894
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:29,410
Slam the door in his face?

895
01:02:30,497 --> 01:02:33,365
Some women would do just that, I dare say.

896
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,575
But not your wife, believe me.

897
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:38,252
She invites me, gives me a drink.

898
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:42,207
Makes me sit down on a nice, soft couch

899
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:45,259
and when her husband calls
she says there's no one there.

900
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:49,342
Is that what she did?

901
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:50,764
Do you have to ask?

902
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:54,973
It was you who phoned, wasn't it?

903
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:57,472
You heard what she said.

904
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:00,228
And then?

905
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,981
Inspector, I'm a gentleman.

906
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:05,108
You wouldn't want me to tell you anymore.

907
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:14,038
I told you what to do, now do it.

908
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:25,841
Hello, can I give you a lift?

909
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:29,045
No thank you, I never
take lifts from strange men.

910
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:32,132
Good girl, I see you're being
more careful than yesterday.

911
01:03:33,101 --> 01:03:35,969
Oh by the way, I've lost
my cigarette lighter,

912
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:37,598
maybe I left it at your place?

913
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,271
No, I don't think so.

914
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,474
We didn't smoke remember.

915
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:43,935
Where else could I have left it then?

916
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:46,487
Maybe underneath my couch?

917
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:55,155
Trying to be smart hmm?

918
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:05,631
It's no good beating about
the bush with you is it?

919
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:06,842
No.

920
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:08,922
That goes for me too.

921
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:12,596
Get in, we'll go for a little ride.

922
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:22,014
Where are you going to take me?

923
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:23,599
It's a surprise.

924
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:48,420
Doesn't it give you a thrill to be high?

925
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:52,845
High up like this,
looking down on the world.

926
01:04:59,187 --> 01:05:01,187
For an insurance man, you're
not behaving too well.

927
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:09,521
And how do you think
you're behaving madam?

928
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:16,531
Disgracefully.

929
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:20,288
Do you intend to keep it up?

930
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,500
Yes.

931
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:36,096
Then I warn you,

932
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:39,141
my behaviors getting worse
and worse from now on.

933
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:42,098
Do you mean to tell
me you have no morals?

934
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:43,895
None whatever, I'm a rat.

935
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:47,559
And I'm a cat.

936
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:27,454
What's your name?

937
01:07:27,669 --> 01:07:29,285
I never asked.

938
01:07:29,504 --> 01:07:30,504
Hans Schmidt.

939
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,212
Sounds like a false name.

940
01:07:36,094 --> 01:07:38,632
It is.

941
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:44,933
I can't call you Hans
anyway, it's rhymes with Franz.

942
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,188
Call me Max, that better?

943
01:07:50,817 --> 01:07:51,817
Yes Max.

944
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:58,405
It's late, I must go.

945
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:03,452
Why?

946
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:06,326
I've got a husband, remember.

947
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:07,541
Who cares?

948
01:08:08,293 --> 01:08:09,500
No really, I must go.

949
01:08:13,006 --> 01:08:14,006
Don't go.

950
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,581
No really I must.

951
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,883
What are you doing?

952
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:20,507
Now don't be silly, let me get dressed.

953
01:08:20,722 --> 01:08:22,133
Please, really I've got to go.

954
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:19,941
I like those red tulips too.

955
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,489
Well you take your time,
all the time you want.

956
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:26,319
All right, just give me two
dozen of the yellow tulips.

957
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:27,537
All right.

958
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:32,834
Hello.

959
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:35,418
Yes Harry, I know.

960
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:42,488
Tulips
mean anything to you sir?

961
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:44,629
Tulips?

962
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:14,459
Hi.

963
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:15,502
How's Mrs. Bulon?

964
01:10:17,672 --> 01:10:19,083
Thanks, fine.

965
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:21,005
That's nice.

966
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:29,514
From now on, keep away
from her, understand.

967
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:32,347
Why?

968
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:33,894
Because it won't be healthy

969
01:10:34,105 --> 01:10:37,143
to keep on making love
to Mrs. Bulon, get me?

970
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:37,973
You know what?

971
01:10:38,192 --> 01:10:39,478
It's none of your damn business.

972
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:44,239
Well now.

973
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,282
He still doesn't understand yet?

974
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:48,779
Boys.

975
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:04,462
Now do you get the message?

976
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:07,044
Keep away from Mrs. Bulon.

977
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,263
Come on.

978
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:13,429
Now be a good boy huh?

979
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:32,078
You want to see me sir?

980
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:35,372
Oh Bulon, you lock yourself in now huh?

981
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:39,827
Yes, well, when I
want a chance to think.

982
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:41,046
To think?

983
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:45,674
Yes, I have to write
a long report tonight.

984
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:47,626
About the Schouermann case?

985
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:49,177
Yes.

986
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:50,629
Well, what is it?

987
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:52,339
I need to think about it first.

988
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:55,426
I'll let you know in the morning.

989
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:58,809
Very well, tomorrow morning.

990
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:06,358
Bulon, without fail, hmm?

991
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:07,572
Tomorrow.

992
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:30,969
Yeah.

993
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:31,920
It's Max.

994
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:35,428
Tomorrow then, we'll
make it tomorrow okay?

995
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:38,931
Didn't you hear?

996
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:40,808
Hey, it's me.

997
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:42,890
Yes I heard.

998
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:44,336
But afterwards I want to see you,

999
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,272
you forgot to give me
back the lucky dollar.

1000
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:49,104
Let's say 11 at the same place.

1001
01:12:50,825 --> 01:12:51,825
Alright.

1002
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:02,914
You really want to marry
me, in spite of everything?

1003
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:05,917
I love
you and I believe you.

1004
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:08,670
Those people have got
nothing to do with you.

1005
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:28,833
What happened?

1006
01:14:29,048 --> 01:14:30,048
Who hit you?

1007
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:34,255
Some ugly customers with no manners.

1008
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:40,590
Selling insurance again?

1009
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:43,723
They tried
to sell some yarn to me.

1010
01:14:46,941 --> 01:14:49,228
Hell, it nearly did work
as a matter of fact.

1011
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:52,610
They very nearly had me sold.

1012
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:55,323
Oh I'm sorry sir.

1013
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:58,112
Have you been here all night?

1014
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:00,370
Yeah.

1015
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,534
I uh, I had a lot to do.

1016
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:13,624
Listen Siegert, I've got an
appointment this morning.

1017
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:14,879
It's a personal matter.

1018
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:17,586
If I'm not back by midday

1019
01:15:17,805 --> 01:15:21,139
I want you to give that
envelope to Ostermeyer,

1020
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:22,511
with my regards.

1021
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:24,263
But I don't understand sir.

1022
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:25,478
You will.

1023
01:15:30,317 --> 01:15:31,433
See you later.

1024
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:36,081
Max, why do you like
to make love on the floor?

1025
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:41,713
Don't you?

1026
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:43,797
Give me some of that cigarette.

1027
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:46,091
This is special.

1028
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:47,310
I know.

1029
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:55,318
Thanks.

1030
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:10,832
You're crazy to bring me here again.

1031
01:17:16,549 --> 01:17:17,915
You're crazy to have come.

1032
01:17:19,093 --> 01:17:20,093
I like danger.

1033
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,303
I must go now.

1034
01:17:28,519 --> 01:17:29,805
Max, don't go.

1035
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:31,020
I must.

1036
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:34,514
Today it's me that's got to hurry away.

1037
01:17:36,277 --> 01:17:37,484
I have to see someone.

1038
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:41,733
It won't take me long though.

1039
01:17:57,381 --> 01:17:58,872
Wait for me?

1040
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:00,878
Max, now don't be long.

1041
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:02,629
Half an hour, not more.

1042
01:18:15,816 --> 01:18:16,897
I'll be right back.

1043
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:22,197
Max?

1044
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:29,495
Oh Max.

1045
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:31,298
Put up your
hands and don't move.

1046
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:40,644
I always drop the knife by the body,

1047
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:42,816
you ought to know that by now.

1048
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:44,360
What knife?

1049
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:45,571
And what body?

1050
01:19:46,907 --> 01:19:48,489
We had an agreement, didn't we?

1051
01:19:48,701 --> 01:19:49,782
Which you didn't keep.

1052
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:52,305
If you were going to kill her,

1053
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:54,446
you'd have done it two days ago, not now.

1054
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,373
Not even you can do it now.

1055
01:19:57,584 --> 01:19:58,370
What do you mean?

1056
01:19:58,585 --> 01:19:59,917
I mean, I know my wife.

1057
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:04,506
It took her two days
to get into your blood,

1058
01:20:04,717 --> 01:20:06,174
just like she got into mine.

1059
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:09,419
I've been watching you Max,

1060
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:12,756
and I know what I'm talking about.

1061
01:20:13,934 --> 01:20:14,970
You're under arrest.

1062
01:20:16,562 --> 01:20:19,054
You can't do that,
you know what'll happen.

1063
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:20,730
Yes I know,

1064
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:23,058
and I'm perfectly happy
to pay what it costs.

1065
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:26,228
That's something you wouldn't understand.

1066
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:29,949
Get in.

1067
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:40,408
We all have to pay in the end you know.

1068
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:43,415
Everybody has to pay for what they do.

1069
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:45,747
Speak for yourself!

1070
01:20:53,015 --> 01:20:54,015
You're done for.

1071
01:20:55,309 --> 01:20:58,302
You're done for anyway.

1072
01:21:27,925 --> 01:21:31,714
I enclose a full report of
the Harry Schouermann case.

1073
01:21:31,929 --> 01:21:33,670
Which I think you will
find is all you need.

1074
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:37,348
But before reading it,
kindly do the following.

1075
01:21:58,122 --> 01:21:59,122
Here I am.

1076
01:22:02,626 --> 01:22:04,993
Lisa.

1077
01:22:05,212 --> 01:22:10,082
Lisa!

1078
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:35,241
Follow me.

1079
01:22:44,543 --> 01:22:45,543
Halt!

1080
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:47,804
Stop, you're surrounded.

1081
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:30,768
Harry, Harry!

1082
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:34,309
Lisa, what are you doing here?

1083
01:24:35,195 --> 01:24:36,527
I had to see you.

1084
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:37,353
Why?

1085
01:24:37,573 --> 01:24:38,984
But Harry, I don't understand.

1086
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:42,241
Stop acting my dear,

1087
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:44,409
I know you too well.

1088
01:24:46,123 --> 01:24:47,580
And don't pretend you love me.

1089
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:52,420
Max.

1090
01:24:53,672 --> 01:24:55,334
I don't know what you mean?

1091
01:24:55,549 --> 01:24:56,130
No?

1092
01:24:56,341 --> 01:24:58,424
Max Lindt is a professional killer,

1093
01:24:59,469 --> 01:25:02,758
and what's more he
happened to work for me.

1094
01:25:05,642 --> 01:25:07,850
I'll tell you something
else you didn't know.

1095
01:25:09,187 --> 01:25:11,770
It was Bulon who sent Max to see you.

1096
01:26:05,619 --> 01:26:09,283
Your husband was an
outstanding man Mrs. Bulon,

1097
01:26:09,498 --> 01:26:10,498
to the end.
