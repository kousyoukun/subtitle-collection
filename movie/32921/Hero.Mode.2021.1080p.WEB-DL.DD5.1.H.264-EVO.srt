00:00:33,818 --> 00:00:36,654
特洛伊。特洛伊,你准备好了吗?你的游戏完成了吗?
Troy. Troy, you ready? Is your game done?

2
00:00:36,688 --> 00:00:38,322
我已经开始了一个新的。
I already started a new one.

3
00:00:38,355 --> 00:00:40,224
一个新的吗?
A new one?

4
00:00:40,257 --> 00:00:42,594
老兄，我还没玩完你最后一款游戏呢。
Dude, I haven't even finished playing your last game yet.

5
00:00:42,627 --> 00:00:45,295
让我们把游戏放到应用商店里，好吗?
Look, let's put the games on the app store, right?

6
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:47,765
我会制作宣传视频。我们会发财。
I'll make the promo videos. We'll get rich.

7
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:50,267
然后女孩?嗯?
And then girls? Huh?

8
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,236
——嘿,女士们!——不。
- Hey, ladies! - Nope.

9
00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:54,338
尼克，你知道这和女孩无关。
Nick, you know it's not about the girls, man.

10
00:00:54,371 --> 00:00:57,407
而是关于创造一款优秀的游戏并在Pixelcon上展示它。
It's about making one great game and showing it off at Pixelcon.

11
00:00:57,441 --> 00:00:59,611
是的,喜欢……就像你爸爸那样。
Yeah, like... like your dad did.

12
00:01:02,714 --> 00:01:03,648
好吧，好吧。
All right, fine, fine.

13
00:01:03,681 --> 00:01:05,583
至少让我看看我的Nickalicious频道吧?
Let me at least show my Nickalicious channel?

14
00:01:05,617 --> 00:01:07,217
我是说，五分钱党肯定会喜欢的。
I mean, look, the Nickheads would love it.

15
00:01:07,251 --> 00:01:08,620
我以为他们是五分钱影院?
I thought they were the Nickelodeons?

16
00:01:08,653 --> 00:01:10,755
是的，版权问题，所以…
Yeah, copyright problems, so...

17
00:01:10,788 --> 00:01:12,590
我们还在努力。
We're still workshopping it.

18
00:01:12,624 --> 00:01:15,158
拜托，让我给他们看看?
Please, let me show them?

19
00:01:15,192 --> 00:01:16,260
好吧。
Okay.

20
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:18,128
——真的吗?——没有。
- Really? - No.

21
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,396
至少让我妈妈看看吧?
Can I at least show my mom?

特洛伊……我意识到一件非常严重的事情
Troy... I have become aware of a very serious matter

98

我们只有15名学生参加了比赛。
is that only 15 of our students entered the competition.

120
00:05:03,488 --> 00:05:06,958
这是奇怪的……你会检查的。

是啊!天啊，我有个问题要问你
Yeah! Oh my god, I had a question for you

122
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:10,427
我不得不把它写下来

123
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:12,429
因为我并不完全理解它。
because I don't really fully understand it.

I'm old, you know?

125
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:17,568
你非法黑进国家科学基金会的数据库了吗

153
00:06:31,843 --> 00:06:34,579
但我会有一根很酷的手杖作为武器。
But I would have a pretty cool cane as a weapon.

154
00:06:34,612 --> 00:06:35,713
然后是……
And then there's...

155
00:06:35,746 --> 00:06:37,982
特洛伊，他来了。
Troy the boy, there he is.

156

<我>吉米!首席设计师…< / i >

<i>Go back, control Z, control Z!</i>

159
00:06:42,954 --> 00:06:45,089
<i>在现实生活中行不通
<i>That doesn't work in real life.</i>

160
00:06:45,122 --> 00:06:46,824
告诉我，特洛伊·贝哈尔，发生了什么?
Go ahead and tell me Troy Behar, what's going on?

161
00:06:46,858 --> 00:06:48,926
我听说你今天被学校开除了。
I heard you got kicked out of school today.

162
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,595
如果你想找点事做，
Well, if you're looking for something to do,

163
00:06:50,628 --> 00:06:52,830
我们可以让你去游乐场工作。
we could probably put you to work over at Playfield.

164
00:06:52,864 --> 00:06:55,499
等待,真的吗?那真是太棒了。
Wait, really? That actually would be awesome.

165
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:57,468
是的。你知道怎么擦吗?
Yeah. Do you know how to squeegee?

166
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,737
呵呵。只是kiddin”。
Hehe. Just kiddin'.

167
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,640
吉米!布鲁斯在这里。来吧。
Jimmy! Bruce is here. Come on.

168
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:05,076
是的。
Yeah.

169
00:07:05,109 --> 00:07:06,477
嘿!
Hey!

170
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,045
好吧,呃,嗨。
Well, uh, hi.

171
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,182
我知道你。我看到你。
I know you. I-I saw you.

172
00:07:11,215 --> 00:07:13,818
是的,在学校。
Yeah, at school.

173
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:16,187
是你，对吧?今天……唱歌吗?
That was you, right? Today... singing?

174
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,856
是啊，我刚搬去和我爷爷林登一起住。
Yeah, I just moved in with my grandpa, Lyndon.

175
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,825
他想让我出去社交。
He wanted me to get out and socialize.

176
00:07:23,995 --> 00:07:25,630
你是第一个80岁以下的人
You're actually like the first person under 80

177
00:07:25,663 --> 00:07:26,964
我在学校外认识的人。
I've met outside of school.

178
00:07:26,998 --> 00:07:29,901
相同。
Same.

179
00:07:29,934 --> 00:07:32,770
嗯…好吧。
Uh... okay.

180
00:07:32,803 --> 00:07:34,672
-那个dj是你朋友吗?-一，二，三，啊!
- So is that deejay your friend? - One, two, three, ah!

181
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:38,142
一，二，三，啊!一，二，三，啊!
One, two, three, ah! One, two, three, ah!

182
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:40,478
是的,尼克。
Yeah, Nick.

183
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:41,979
他是我最好的朋友。
Well, he's my best friend.

184
00:07:42,013 --> 00:07:43,915
其实是我唯一的朋友。
My only friend, actually.

185
00:07:43,948 --> 00:07:45,917
是的…但他很了不起。
Yeah... but he is a lot.

186
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,986
所以…特洛伊，是吗?
So... Troy the boy, is it?

187
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,088
啊…特洛伊。
Ah... just Troy.

188
00:07:51,122 --> 00:07:52,123
佩奇。
Just Paige.

189
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:02,066
对不起,嗯…
Sorry, um...

190
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:05,836
你是第一个真正理解我们的天使投资人。
So, you are the first angel investor who really gets us.

191
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,904
事情的真相是
The truth of the matter is

192
00:08:06,938 --> 00:08:07,905
我的孙子们一直在追我
my grandkids have been after me

193
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:10,741
投资一些很酷的东西，你知道的，永远的。
to invest into something cool, you know, forever.

194
00:08:10,775 --> 00:08:14,679
我对比特币非常感兴趣。
And, well, I am very deep into BitCoin.

195
00:08:14,712 --> 00:08:16,113
——哇。——是的!
- Whoa. - Yeah!

196
00:08:16,147 --> 00:08:18,649
但我们之间，我真的不知道那是什么。
But between us, I don't really know what it is.

197
00:08:18,683 --> 00:08:19,617
不，没人知道。
No, no one does.

198
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,019
他们沉迷于你以前的游戏。
And they are obsessed with your old games.

199
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:23,921
所以我觉得这是十拿九稳的。
And so I just figured this was a shoo-in.

200
00:08:23,955 --> 00:08:25,089
这是十拿九稳的，
It is a shoo-in,

201
00:08:25,122 --> 00:08:27,158
你投资我们真是太聪明了。
and you're so smart to invest in us.

202
00:08:27,191 --> 00:08:28,993
我们真的很感激你的加入。
And we're really grateful to have you onboard.

203
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:30,661
这对我们来说非常令人兴奋。
This is very exciting for us.

204
00:08:30,695 --> 00:08:32,196
如果你想做点什么
If you want something to do,

205
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:34,565
那里有个卡拉ok机
there's, like, a karaoke machine

206
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:35,533
连接到扬声器…
hooked up to the speakers...

207
00:08:35,566 --> 00:08:38,102
我真的不想成为焦点。
I'm really not looking for the spotlight.

208
00:08:38,135 --> 00:08:40,905
是的。是的,完全。那很酷。
Yeah. Yeah, totally. That's cool.

209
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:43,040
这整件事到底是为了什么?
What's this whole thing for, anyway?

210
00:08:43,074 --> 00:08:45,776
嗯…是给我妈妈的公司买的。
Uh... it's for my mom's company.

211
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,679
是的。我觉得这有很大的关系。
Yeah. I think there's a lot riding on it.

212
00:08:48,713 --> 00:08:49,814
这是非常酷的。
It's very cool.

213
00:08:49,847 --> 00:08:51,115
非常非常酷。
Very, very cool.

214
00:08:51,148 --> 00:08:52,583
那是你爸爸吗?
Is that your dad?

215
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:55,186
不，我爸在我很小的时候就去世了。
No, my dad died when I was little.

216
00:08:55,219 --> 00:08:57,555
我…我真的很抱歉。我不知道。
I'm... I'm really sorry. I didn't know.

217
00:08:57,588 --> 00:09:00,257
不，完全没问题。那是很久以前的事了。
No, it's totally fine. It was a long time ago.

218
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,158
只有我和我妈
It's been just me and my mom

219
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:04,095
基本上我的整个人生，所以…
for like basically my whole life, so...

220
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:05,563
我能理解这一点。
I can kinda relate to that.

221
00:09:05,596 --> 00:09:09,000
我爸也不在我生活中。
My dad's not really in my life either.

222
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:11,102
布鲁斯,在这里。现在仍然是beta。
Bruce, here. Now it's still in beta.

223
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:12,737
不要给别人看
Don't show it to anyone else,

224
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,205
但要把它放在孩子的枕头下。
but put it under your kids' pillows.

225
00:09:14,238 --> 00:09:15,306
他们一定会很喜欢这个游戏的
They're gonna love this game so much

226
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:17,608
他们会尿床的!
they're gonna be wetting your bed!

227
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:18,809
Uhhhh……
Uhhhh...

228
00:09:18,843 --> 00:09:20,845
事实上，我的孙子们确实有尿床的问题。
Actually, my grandkids do have a problem with wetting.

229
00:09:20,878 --> 00:09:21,912
——所以……——啊……
- So... - Ahhh...

230
00:09:21,946 --> 00:09:23,047
这有点问题。
It's a bit of a problem.

231
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,115
它是一个表达式。呵。
It's an expression. Heh-heh.

232
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:25,683
这是一个烂摊子。
It's a mess.

233
00:09:25,716 --> 00:09:27,184
不，我喜欢你的想法。
But, no, I like where your head is.

234
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:30,921
好吧，我能先给你拿杯喝的吗?
Well, look, can I get you a drink before we ink?

235
00:09:30,955 --> 00:09:32,323
非常非常好，我喜欢这个口号。
Very very good, I like that slogan.

236
00:09:32,356 --> 00:09:33,357
知道吗，我很好，谢谢。
You know what, I'm good, thank you.

237
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:36,160
我要自己去拿，也就是说我会…
I'm gonna grab it myself, which means I will...

238
00:09:36,193 --> 00:09:37,862
马上回来。
BRB.

239
00:09:37,895 --> 00:09:38,863
这是我孙子教我的。
My grandkids taught me that.

240
00:09:38,896 --> 00:09:39,864
哦,是的,是的。
Oh yes, yes.

241
00:09:39,897 --> 00:09:40,898
上帝保佑他们。
God bless 'em.

242
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:43,768
好吧,哈哈。呵。
Well, LOL. Heh-heh.

243
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:45,302
我觉得那很脏。
I think that's dirty.

244
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:46,871
——不!不,不,不。——不,不。
- No! No, no, no. - No, no.

245
00:09:46,904 --> 00:09:48,773
放声大笑或在线大笑。
Laugh out loud or laugh online.

246
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:49,974
不是每个人的笑。
Not everyone's laughing.

247
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:53,177
我们只是想找点乐子。呵呵呵。我们有一个很好的时间。
We just like to have fun. Heh heh. We have a good time.

248
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,046
天啊，你做了什么?
Oh my god, what did you do?

249
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:57,114
-我不知道我为什么说…-你为什么给他那个?
- I don't know why I said... - Why did you give him that?

250
00:09:57,148 --> 00:09:57,948
-他会喜欢的——不,不。这不是准备好了!
- He's gonna love it. - No, no. It's not ready!

251
00:09:57,982 --> 00:09:59,116
他不知道该拿它怎么办。
He won't know what to do with it.

252
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,084
-还没准备好。-你在开玩笑吗?这是准备好了。
- It's really not ready. - Are you kidding? It's ready.

253
00:10:00,117 --> 00:10:01,752
他能看到一些小东西和机器人。
He'll be able to see little bits and bots.

254
00:10:01,786 --> 00:10:02,820
它会没事的。
It'll be fine.

255
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,088
我能问你点事吗?
Hey, can I ask you something?

256
00:10:04,121 --> 00:10:05,222
是的。
Yes.

257
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:08,659
她为什么需要那根拐杖?
Why does she need that cane?

258
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:10,628
她是一个向导。
She's a wizard.

259
00:10:10,661 --> 00:10:11,829
一个向导吗?
A wizard?

260
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:14,231
她有一个…一个向导的城堡。
She has like a... a wizard castle.

261
00:10:14,265 --> 00:10:15,733
拜托，拐杖是干什么用的?
Come on, what's the cane for?

262
00:10:15,766 --> 00:10:20,638
嗯…她得了多发性硬化症。
Uh... well, she has MS.

263
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:21,939
我是二换二。
I'm two for two.

264
00:10:21,972 --> 00:10:23,174
不,你很好。
No, you're fine.

265
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:24,942
这并不能让她慢下来。
It doesn't slow her down much.

266
00:10:24,975 --> 00:10:26,877
似乎没有。
It doesn't seem to.

267
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:29,246
至少今晚不行。
At least not tonight.

268
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,882
嗬嗬，特洛伊的海伦!
Ho-ho, Helen of Troy!

269
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:32,716
啊!
Ah!

270
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,718
看来你不需要任何帮助
Looks like you don't need any help

271
00:10:34,752 --> 00:10:35,986
去接一位女士。
picking up one of the ladies.

272
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,755
只是开玩笑。
Just kidding.

273
00:10:37,788 --> 00:10:39,824
特洛伊·斯托里，你妈妈要开口了
Troy Story, your mom is about to start talking

274
00:10:39,857 --> 00:10:40,891
所以如果你能处理好音乐
so if you can take care of the music

275
00:10:40,925 --> 00:10:43,294
不管这是什么…不是。
and wrap up whatever this... isn't.

276
00:10:46,697 --> 00:10:48,766
吉米……
Jimmy...

277
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:51,102
那家伙太棒了。
That guy is awesome.

278
00:10:51,135 --> 00:10:53,637
是的，他是这么认为的。
Yeah, he thinks so.

279
00:10:53,671 --> 00:10:54,905
——嗯。-恩……
- Ummm. - Ummmm...

280
00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:56,874
是的,所以……好吧，我必须…
Yeah, so that... well, I do have to...

281
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:57,942
我得走了。
I have to go.

282
00:10:57,975 --> 00:10:59,143
哦,是的,嗯…
Oh, yeah, uh...

283
00:10:59,176 --> 00:11:01,812
嗯…再见……
Uh... see ya...

284
00:11:01,846 --> 00:11:04,682
——再见。——再见。
- Bye. - Bye.

285
00:11:04,715 --> 00:11:07,084
这东西很重。
This thing is heavy.

286
00:11:07,118 --> 00:11:11,956
你的思想很强大，但你的手臂很虚弱。
Your mind is strong, but your arms are weak.

287
00:11:11,989 --> 00:11:12,990
嘿,伙计们!
Hey, guys!

288
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,091
天啊，抱歉。
Oh, god, uh, sorry.

谢谢你！
Thank you.

291
00:11:17,294 --> 00:11:18,762
这只是我的副业。
It's just my side gig.

292
00:11:18,796 --> 00:11:20,664
我更有影响力。
I'm more of an influencer.

293
00:11:20,698 --> 00:11:22,867
我刚在YouTube上获得了上千个订阅。
I just crossed a thousand subs on YouTube.

294

297
00:11:28,806 --> 00:11:31,342
你们是千禧一代吗?
Are you millennials, by any chance?

298
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:34,912
我在这个东西上有个新游戏。
I have this new game on this thing here.

299
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,347
无论如何，它甚至还没有向公众开放，
Anyway, it's not even available to the public yet,

300
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,016
但我不知道该怎么下载。
but I'm just not sure how to download it.

301
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:41,785
你能帮我吗?
Could you help me?

302
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:43,187
我们到他的办公室去吧。
Let's step into his office.

303
00:11:47,024 --> 00:11:48,792
<我>粉碎,粉碎,粉碎。< / i >
<i>Smashing, smashing, smashing.</i>

304
00:11:48,826 --> 00:11:50,694
看看这些剪报。
Look at all this clipping.

305
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:51,762
那家伙的头探出了大楼
The guy's head pokes out of the building

306
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,697
每次他都跳。
every time he jumps.

307
00:11:53,731 --> 00:11:54,765
我打赌这东西的漏洞报告
I bet the bug report for this thing

308
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,200
大概有一英里长。
is like a mile long.

309
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:57,835
这配乐让我很难过。
This soundtrack makes me sad.

310
00:11:57,868 --> 00:12:00,304
它只是为了复古而复古。
It just feels retro for retro's sake.

311
00:12:00,337 --> 00:12:02,173
先生，你在哪儿找到的?
Sir, where'd you find this?

312
00:12:02,206 --> 00:12:05,342
老兄，我随时都能让游戏出故障，看好了。
Dude, I can make the game glitch anytime I want, watch.

313
00:12:08,412 --> 00:12:09,481
告诉丫。
Told ya.

314
00:12:09,514 --> 00:12:12,416
先生，这只是我的意见，但别玩了
Sir, it's just my opinion, but throw this game out

315
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:15,487
去Playfield买个游戏
and get yourself a game from Playfield.

316
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,457
我几乎做到了。你留着吧。
I almost did. You can keep that.

317
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:28,866
哦,嘘…
Oh, shhhh...

318
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:32,169
这对我们所有人来说都是一个历史性的时刻。
This is kind of a historic moment for all of us.

319
00:12:32,203 --> 00:12:36,006
因为我们终于找到了我们的天使投资人。
Because we have finally found our angel investor.

320
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,042
时机也不早，对吧，林登?
And not a moment too soon, right, Lyndon?

321
00:12:38,075 --> 00:12:41,078
哇……唷!
Whoa... Whew!

322
00:12:41,111 --> 00:12:44,148
好了，我想让大家举起酒杯。
Alright, I'd like everyone to raise your glasses.

323
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:48,886
废话少说，我给你布鲁斯!
Without any further ado, I give you Bruce!

324
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:51,489
布鲁斯，你在吗?来加入我们!
Bruce, are you here? Come join us!

325
00:12:51,523 --> 00:12:52,790
他走了。
He's gone.

326
00:12:52,823 --> 00:12:53,658
什么?
What?

327
00:12:53,692 --> 00:12:55,392
从后面溜出去的，我不知道。
Slipped out the back, I don't know.

328
00:12:55,426 --> 00:12:57,828
妈妈……
Mom...

329
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,296
特洛伊?
Troy?

330
00:13:05,336 --> 00:13:08,973
哦……
Oh...

331
00:13:09,006 --> 00:13:12,109
对不起，各位，我想我说得太早了，但是…
I'm sorry, everybody, I think I spoke too soon, but...

332
00:13:14,178 --> 00:13:15,179
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

333
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:13,971
嘿,妈妈。
Hey, Mom.

334
00:14:14,004 --> 00:14:16,206
嗯……妈妈，我很抱歉。
Umm... Mom, I'm so sorry.

335
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,509
我相信这对你来说一定很困难
I'm sure it must have been very difficult for you

336
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:19,910
不要破坏我们的游戏
to not rip apart our game

337
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:23,213
在派对上你唯一不认识的人面前。
in front of the only person you didn't know at the party.

338
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:26,183
我得想点别的办法。
I'm going to have to figure something else out.

339
00:14:29,521 --> 00:14:32,590
凯特，这有点尴尬，但是…
Kate, this is awkward, but...

340
00:14:32,624 --> 00:14:34,992
我们没有钱了。
we don't have any more money.

341
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:36,494
什么?
What?

342
00:14:36,528 --> 00:14:38,395
我说了我们没钱了。
I said we have no more money.

343
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:41,098
但这是…这是银行，拉里。
But this is... this is a bank, Larry.

344
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:44,101
我们跑了出去。我叫人来。
We ran out. Let me call somebody.

345
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:45,269
因为我们是朋友。
Because we're friends.

346
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:46,370
好吧。
Okay.

347
00:14:48,906 --> 00:14:51,375
嗨,杰夫。嗨。
Hey, Jeff. Hi.

348
00:14:51,408 --> 00:14:53,545
是的,凯特在这里。好吧。
Yeah, Kate's here. Okay.

349
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:55,145
她拿不到钱?
She can't have the money?

350
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:57,014
因为我们没有更多了?
Because we don't have any more?

351
00:14:57,047 --> 00:15:00,317
好吧，这就是我的想法。谢谢你！
Alright, that's what I thought. Thank you.

352
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,653
看到了吗?
See?

353
00:15:01,686 --> 00:15:03,220
如果你不想把钱给我，
You know, if you don't want to give me the money,

354
00:15:03,253 --> 00:15:04,154
你可以直接拒绝。
you could just say no.

355
00:15:04,188 --> 00:15:05,557
不。
No.

356
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,892
你的工资单还在，我们不能。
With your payroll where it's at, we can't.

357
00:15:08,926 --> 00:15:10,227
我是说，就算我们能，也不能。
I mean, even if we could, we can't.

358
00:15:24,676 --> 00:15:26,310
我得走了…
You know what, I gotta go...

359
00:15:32,383 --> 00:15:34,151
凯特,告诉我,
Kate, tell me,

360
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:35,953
什么风把你吹来了?
to what do I owe this pleasure?

361
00:15:35,986 --> 00:15:38,989
我会直入正题的。
I'll cut straight to the chase.

362
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:43,461
我们遇到了一些困难，如果我们的游戏没有大获成功，
We've run into a bit of a snag and if our game isn't a big hit,

363
00:15:43,495 --> 00:15:45,996
我们会有大麻烦的。
we're gonna be in a lot of trouble.

364
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:50,635
我想知道你是否有兴趣…
So, I was wondering if you might possibly be interested in...

365
00:15:50,668 --> 00:15:53,571
买下你的游戏。我愿意为你这么做。
Buying out your games. Yeah, I would do that for you.

366
00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:56,974
听着，凯特，在大学里玩你早期的游戏
Look, Kate, playing your early games in college

367
00:15:57,007 --> 00:15:58,942
是我开始从事这一行的原因。
is what got me into this business to begin with.

368
00:15:58,976 --> 00:16:00,077
我不知道"老里克"
You know, I don't know if "ol' Rickers"

369
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,646
在布朗大学待了五年半
would made it through five and a half years at Brown

370
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:03,981
如果不是Playfield Games
if it wasn't for Playfield Games.

371
00:16:04,014 --> 00:16:06,216
我可能会去找女孩和毒品，
I probably would have just resorted to girls and drugs,

372
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,218
感谢上帝，你救了我。
so, thank God, you saved me from that.

373
00:16:08,252 --> 00:16:09,420
哇。
Wow.

374
00:16:09,454 --> 00:16:13,257
这是文件。我们会成功的。
So, here's the paperwork. We are gonna make this happen.

375
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,291
谢谢你！
Thank you.

376
00:16:14,324 --> 00:16:16,126
呃，我有点奇怪
Uh, I'm a little weirded out

377
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,295
你都准备好了。
that you had this all prepared already.

378
00:16:18,328 --> 00:16:21,533
我是一名童子军，凯特。我总是准备好了。
Well, I'm a Boy Scout, Kate. I'm always prepared.

379
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:23,400
好吧。太好了。
Okay. Great.

380
00:16:23,434 --> 00:16:25,737
你知道吗…说话的男孩……
You know what, um... speaking of boys...

381
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,671
什么?
What?

382
00:16:26,704 --> 00:16:29,574
嘿。你何不试试我们最新的游戏?
Hey. Why don't you take our latest game?

383
00:16:29,607 --> 00:16:31,208
我肯定坦普尔曼会喜欢的。
I'm sure that Templeton's gonna love it.

384
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,745
临时…特洛伊?
Temp... Troy?

385
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:36,246
该死，我就知道是T开头的。
Dang it, I knew it started with a T.

386
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,182
你知道吗，反正我也要跟自己击掌
You know what, I'm gonna give myself a high five anyway

387
00:16:38,215 --> 00:16:39,183
因为我已经很接近那个了。
because I got pretty close on that one.

388
00:16:39,216 --> 00:16:40,518
好了，往高处走，宝贝!
Alright, up high, baby!

389
00:16:40,552 --> 00:16:42,085
繁荣。
Boom.

390
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:43,655
另外，这里不会有工作机会
P.S. There would not be jobs here

391
00:16:43,688 --> 00:16:45,723
当然是为了你的员工。
for any of your employees, of course.

392
00:16:45,757 --> 00:16:46,691
很高兴见到你。
It's great to see you.

393
00:16:58,302 --> 00:16:59,737
妈妈，我还没来得及告诉你你就走了
Mom, you left before I could tell you

394
00:16:59,771 --> 00:17:01,673
但看看我对杰克豪斯做了什么。
but look what I did on Jackhouse.

395
00:17:01,706 --> 00:17:05,108
哇，你真的进步很大。
Wow, you really did make a lot of progress.

396
00:17:06,744 --> 00:17:09,446
看看这个。
Check this out.

397
00:17:09,481 --> 00:17:10,748
Xodus吗?
Xodus?

398
00:17:10,782 --> 00:17:12,349
(我得考虑把公司卖给他们。)
I have to consider selling the company to them.

399
00:17:12,382 --> 00:17:13,317
什么?为什么?
What? Why?

400
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:16,688
这就是他们在Pixelcon发布的内容。
That's what they're releasing at Pixelcon.

401
00:17:16,721 --> 00:17:21,124
<i> >欢迎来到地狱星球
<i>Welcome to Planet Hell.</i>

402
00:17:21,158 --> 00:17:25,128
<i>准备输入您的信用卡信息
<i>Prepare to enter your credit card information.</i>

403
00:17:25,162 --> 00:17:27,465
交易吗?这是可怕的。
Microtransactions? That's terrible.

404
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:30,167
什么……妈，这就像是高档的宰…
What the... Mom, this is like a high end rip-off of...

405
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,402
是的,那是……他们就是这么做的。
Yeah, that's... that's what they do.

406
00:17:32,436 --> 00:17:34,672
妈妈，我不知道游乐场的情况这么糟。
Mom, I didn't know it was that bad at Playfield.

407
00:17:34,706 --> 00:17:35,473
让我来帮你。
Let me come and help.

408
00:17:35,507 --> 00:17:37,441
其实我很擅长这个。
I'm actually really good at this.

409
00:17:37,475 --> 00:17:40,310
你和你爸爸拥有相同的天赋。
You and your dad share the same gift.

410
00:17:40,344 --> 00:17:42,780
但他没有一个正常的童年
But he did not have a normal childhood

411
00:17:42,814 --> 00:17:45,282
我们都发誓过你会的。
and we both swore to each other that you would.

412
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:48,486
我知道,妈妈……但是爸爸已经走了。
I know, Mom... but Dad is gone.

413
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,287
而且他已经很久了。
And he has been for a long time.

414
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,125
和…现在情况不太正常。
And... things aren't normal now.

415
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,361
我不知道你是怎么把这些加到游戏里的。
I don't know how you added all this to the game.

416
00:17:57,394 --> 00:17:59,263
请……妈妈。
Please... Mom.

417
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:00,565
求你了，我觉得这是唯一的办法
Please, I feel like this is the only way

418
00:18:00,598 --> 00:18:03,801
我可以弥补我所做的。
I can make up for what I did.

419
00:18:03,835 --> 00:18:07,304
<我>粉碎,粉碎,粉碎。< / i >
<i>Smashing, smashing, smashing.</i>

420
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:10,440
来吧，穿好衣服。我们要工作了。
Come on, get dressed. We're going to work.

421
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,331
嗨,劳拉,玛丽。
Hi, Laura, Marie.

422
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:35,767
我只想说我很抱歉
I just want to say I'm sorry

423
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,703
昨晚关于投资者的事。
about the investor thing last night.

424
00:18:38,736 --> 00:18:42,372
你为投资者的事感到抱歉吗?
You're sorry about the investor thing?

425
00:18:42,406 --> 00:18:44,408
你知道你做了什么吗?
Do you even understand what you did?

426
00:18:44,441 --> 00:18:47,110
让我用你能理解的语言解释一下。
Let me explain it in words that you'll understand.

427
00:18:47,144 --> 00:18:51,248
你做的事很不光彩，兄弟。
What you did was very, very not lit, fam.

428
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,217
别介意她，她只是太咸了
Don't mind her, she's just salty

429
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:56,854
因为你可能让我们丢了工作。
because you might've cost us all of our jobs.

430
00:18:59,356 --> 00:19:01,559
扎克和科迪!
Zack and Cody!

431
00:19:01,593 --> 00:19:02,760
嗨,吉米。
Hey, Jimmy.

432
00:19:02,794 --> 00:19:04,462
嘿,猫猫。
Hey, slugger.

433
00:19:04,495 --> 00:19:06,464
昨晚很漂亮的女孩。你参加比赛了吗?
Pretty girl last night. Did you get in the game?

434
00:19:06,497 --> 00:19:07,364
去打棒球?
Get in the batter's box?

435
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:11,569
教练给你的信号?
Coach give you the signals?

436
00:19:11,603 --> 00:19:14,739
不。不过我确实和杰克豪斯玩过。
No. I-I did play around with Jackhouse, though.

437
00:19:14,772 --> 00:19:15,807
你怎么想?
What'd you think?

438
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,775
你真的想知道吗?
Uh, you really want to know?

439
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:19,109
是啊!
Yeah!

440
00:19:23,848 --> 00:19:25,349
嗯,很好。
Uh, it's good.

441
00:19:25,382 --> 00:19:27,217
这是好吗?就这些吗?
It was good? That's it?

442
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,386
哦,真的好吗?
Uh, really good?

443
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,589
真的好吗?这是伟大的!
Really good? It is great!

444
00:19:31,623 --> 00:19:34,257
这是我的马里奥3。这是一场完美的比赛。
This is my Mario 3. This is a perfect game.

445
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,728
你知道吗，那个老头，他就是不明白。
You know what, that old man, he just didn't get it.

446
00:19:36,761 --> 00:19:39,229
叫杰克豪斯是因为他们用电钻钻房子?
And it's Jackhouse because they jackhammer houses?

447
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:41,699
是啊!看吧，你懂的。
Yeah! See, you get it.

448
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:43,501
杰克豪斯是因为手提钻，对吧?
Jackhouse because of the jackhammer, right?

449
00:19:43,534 --> 00:19:45,202
她得到它。这里的每个人都懂。
She gets it. Everyone here gets it.

450
00:19:45,235 --> 00:19:46,370
它是可以获得的。
It is gettable.

451
00:19:46,403 --> 00:19:49,439
我们要造出这个东西，让它摇滚起来。
We're gonna build this thing and it's going to rock.

452
00:19:49,474 --> 00:19:50,842
好吧?你妈妈会找到现金的
All right? Your mom is gonna find cash

453
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:51,843
去别的地方吧。
somewhere else for it.

454
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:53,478
但是，我们会没事的。
But, we're gonna be okay.

455
00:19:58,415 --> 00:20:01,318
凯特，我不想做常客
Kate, I-I hate to be such a regular

456
00:20:01,351 --> 00:20:02,754
沮丧的黛比，
Debbie Down in the Dumps,

457
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:07,558
但我们确实需要管理我们的现金流状况。
but we-we do need to manage our cash flow situation.

458
00:20:07,592 --> 00:20:09,527
我知道，我知道。我有个计划。
I know, I know. And I have a plan.

459
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,462
我是说，如果我们不撞到他们的袜子
I mean, if we don't knock their socks

460
00:20:11,496 --> 00:20:13,230
从水里出来的时候，
right out of the water at that show,

461
00:20:13,263 --> 00:20:16,968
我们……我们下个月不发工资了。
we... we won't make payroll next month.

462
00:20:17,001 --> 00:20:20,872
还有另一种解决办法。呃……
There is another solution. The uh...

463
00:20:20,905 --> 00:20:22,406
不。
No.

464
00:20:22,439 --> 00:20:26,644
凯特，凯特，听着，裁员是现实。
Kate, Kate, look, uh, layoffs are a fact of life.

465
00:20:26,678 --> 00:20:28,546
我不能违背我和乔治的承诺
I can't break the promise that George and I made

466
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:30,915
12年前的事了。
12 years ago to all of you.

467
00:20:30,948 --> 00:20:33,283
我们得想个更好的办法。
We'll just have to find a better way.

468
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,252
我知道我们会的，凯特。
Oh, I know we will, Kate.

469
00:20:35,285 --> 00:20:36,854
我知道我们会的。
I know we will.

470
00:20:36,888 --> 00:20:38,523
我们总是这样做。
We always do.

471
00:20:42,026 --> 00:20:43,594
人们会明白的。他们理解。
People will get it. They understand.

472
00:20:43,628 --> 00:20:45,328
好吧?这很有趣。可玩。
All right? It's fun. It's playable.

473
00:20:45,362 --> 00:20:46,329
我需要你…我想让你看看。
I need you... I want you to see it.

474
00:20:46,363 --> 00:20:47,098
你看到了吗?你看到我了吗?
Do you see it? Do you see me?

475
00:20:47,131 --> 00:20:48,533
你看到了吗?你看不出来吗?
Do you see it? You don't see it?

476
00:20:48,566 --> 00:20:49,701
这是一个赢家。
It's a winner.

477
00:20:49,734 --> 00:20:53,270
这就是我要说的。
That's all I'm saying.

478
00:20:53,303 --> 00:20:56,974
赢家!
Winner!

479
00:20:57,008 --> 00:21:00,011
所以…吉米，劳拉，所有人
So... Jimmy, Laura, everyone out there

480
00:21:00,044 --> 00:21:02,947
花了几周的时间来解决这些小问题吗
has been working weeks to try and fix those glitches

481
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,982
你一个晚上就搞定了。
that you managed to fix in one night.

482
00:21:05,016 --> 00:21:06,283
你添加的所有新功能…
And all those new features you added...

483
00:21:06,316 --> 00:21:07,317
是合法的。
Are legit.

484
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,820
他们太合法了。
They are too legit.

485
00:21:08,853 --> 00:21:10,688
是的。哦!等等!
Yeah. Oh! Wait!

486
00:21:10,722 --> 00:21:11,689
不,妈妈,不要……
No, Mom, don't...

487
00:21:11,723 --> 00:21:15,258
♬太合法而不能放弃
♪ Too legit to quitttttt ♪

488
00:21:15,292 --> 00:21:16,894
是的。还有它。
Yeah. Still got it.

489
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:20,263
不开玩笑了，我们需要重新审视一下。
Look, all joking aside, we need a fresh look at things.

490
00:21:20,297 --> 00:21:23,534
碰巧我们的团队…
And it just so happens that our team is...

491
00:21:23,568 --> 00:21:24,802
<我>粉碎。< / i >
<i>Smashing.</i>

492
00:21:24,836 --> 00:21:29,306
刚出主意的
...fresh out of ideas.

493
00:21:29,339 --> 00:21:32,009
所以我让你负责杰克豪斯。
That's why I am putting you in charge of Jackhouse.

494
00:21:34,078 --> 00:21:35,046
你是在耍我还是…?
Are you messing with me or...?

495
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:37,582
不，你最好别让我后悔。
No, and you better not make me regret this.

496
00:21:37,615 --> 00:21:39,416
你只需要在这个游戏上帮我们
You're just going to help us with this one game

497
00:21:39,449 --> 00:21:41,351
然后和你一起回学校。
and then it's back to school with you.

498
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:42,220
哇，等等，我的天。
Wow, wait, holy crap.

499
00:21:42,252 --> 00:21:46,023
所以，我要负责比赛了。
So, I get to be in charge of the game.

500
00:21:46,057 --> 00:21:47,725
等等，吉米也是我管的吗?
Wait, am I in charge of Jimmy too?

501
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:49,694
你疯了吗?
Are you out of your mind?

502
00:21:49,727 --> 00:21:52,063
你只要看看他昨晚做了什么，好吗?
You just have to see what he did last night, okay?

503
00:21:52,096 --> 00:21:53,698
他修复了所有的bug
He fixed all of the bugs

504
00:21:53,731 --> 00:21:56,067
他创造了所有这些可定制的皮肤。
and he created all these customizable skins.

505
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,301
有一道彩虹会说话
There's a rainbow that talks,

506
00:21:58,335 --> 00:22:00,872
还有巴拉克·奥巴马，还有，还有水母。
there's Barack Obama, there's, there's a jellyfish.

507
00:22:00,905 --> 00:22:03,875
这是疯了!我要疯了。
This is insane! I'm going insane.

508
00:22:03,908 --> 00:22:05,375
我知道你很努力，
Look, I know how hard you've worked,

509
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:06,244
但是我们没有时间了。
but we are out of time.

510
00:22:06,276 --> 00:22:07,912
所以，你要把这个拇指吸盘
So, you're gonna put this thumbsucker

511
00:22:07,945 --> 00:22:09,013
负责我的游戏?
in charge of my game?

512
00:22:09,046 --> 00:22:10,148
——嘿!——吉米!
- Hey! - Jimmy!

513
00:22:10,181 --> 00:22:13,751
在Pixelcon之前，Troy负责所有的游戏决策。
Troy is in charge of all game decisions until Pixelcon.

514
00:22:13,785 --> 00:22:15,820
结束讨论。
End of discussion.

515
00:22:15,853 --> 00:22:17,555
现在我们开始工作吧。
Now let's get to work.

516
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:21,324
特洛伊，我想让你在你爸以前的办公室里办公。
Troy, I'd like you to set up in your dad's old office.

517
00:22:21,358 --> 00:22:23,461
好吧。
Okay.

518
00:22:23,494 --> 00:22:26,764
来吧。
Come on.

519
00:22:27,865 --> 00:22:30,701
对不起,吉米。这是必须的。
I'm sorry, Jimmy. This is the way it has to be.

520
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,508
你妈妈让你留着手机吗?
Your mom let you keep your phone?

521
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:11,709
老兄,那就更好了。
Dude, even better.

522
00:23:11,742 --> 00:23:12,877
我会告诉你一切的
I will tell you all about it

523
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:15,412
如果你放学后带几只红牛来操场的话
if you bring a few Red Bulls to Playfield after school.

524
00:23:15,445 --> 00:23:16,747
<我>哇,哇,哇。你是说操场吗?< / i >
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did you say Playfield?</i>

佩吉，你在这干嘛?
Paige, what are you doing here?

535
00:23:48,713 --> 00:23:50,648
我现在和爷爷住在一起
I'm staying with my grandpa right now

536
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:54,585
等我父母"解决问题"
while my parents "work things out."

537
00:23:54,619 --> 00:23:57,188
所以，我每天放学后都要来这里。
So, I have to come here every day after school.

538
00:23:57,221 --> 00:23:59,724
哦。听到这个消息我很难过。
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

539
00:23:59,757 --> 00:24:00,992
我的意思是……对你的父母。
I mean... about your parents.

540
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:02,159
你能来这里真是太好了。
It's great that you get to be here.

541
00:24:02,193 --> 00:24:04,061
我也得待在这里。
I have to be here too.

542
00:24:04,095 --> 00:24:05,963
这是谁的办公室?
Whose office is this?

543
00:24:05,997 --> 00:24:09,500
这是我爸爸以前的办公室，或者说曾经是，
It's my dad's old office, or it used to be,

544
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:10,968
但现在是我的了。
but it's actually mine now.

545
00:24:11,002 --> 00:24:13,604
是啊，我妈让我负责比赛。
Yeah, my mom put me in charge of the game.

546
00:24:13,638 --> 00:24:14,639
她什么?
She what?

547
00:24:14,672 --> 00:24:16,774
我的天啊!
Holy crap and a half!

548
00:24:16,807 --> 00:24:17,942
这是真的。
This is really happening.

549
00:24:19,076 --> 00:24:20,711
-是的，哦，是的。-这是真的!
- Yes, oh, yes. - This is really happening!

Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

551
00:24:24,815 --> 00:24:27,952
是的,哇!是的,是的!
Yeah, whoo! Yes, yes!

552
00:24:27,985 --> 00:24:30,621
心理!喔!
Psych! Ohhhh!

553
00:24:30,655 --> 00:24:32,156
你们有没有想过
Hey, have you guys ever thought of

554
00:24:32,189 --> 00:24:35,226
也许像某人在看《i>》那样跳舞?
maybe dancing like somebody <i>is</i> watching?

555
00:24:35,259 --> 00:24:36,761
这是你的命运。
This is your destiny.

556
00:24:36,794 --> 00:24:38,863
——容易,兄弟。-我有作业要做。
- Easy, bro. - I've got homework to do.

557
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:40,965
你们俩可以讨论你们的命运，但是，
You two can discuss your destiny, but, um,

558
00:24:40,998 --> 00:24:43,768
我想以后再听你说。
I want to hear about this later.

559
00:24:43,801 --> 00:24:47,138
肯定的。
For sure.

560
00:24:47,171 --> 00:24:50,541
越来越好了。
This is getting better and better.

561
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:51,809
-这是最好的。——<我>团队…< / i >
- It's the best. - <i>Team...</i>

562
00:24:51,842 --> 00:24:52,910
<我>特洛伊,会议室!< / i >
<i>Troy, conference room!</i>

563
00:24:52,944 --> 00:24:53,878
——是的!-伙计…
- Yes! - Dude...

564
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:55,780
是时候和我的团队开第一次会了。
It's time for my first meeting with the team.

565
00:24:55,813 --> 00:24:57,815
我该怎么办?
What do I do?

566
00:24:57,848 --> 00:25:00,251
我不知道。就说他们想听的吧。
I don't know. Just tell them what they want to hear.

567
00:25:00,284 --> 00:25:01,619
好的建议。
Good advice.

568
00:25:01,652 --> 00:25:02,687
这是个好建议。
It is good advice.

569
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,889
给他们下地狱。
Give 'em hell.

570
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:07,224
嘿，我可以当实习生吗?
Hey, can I be an intern?

571
00:25:07,258 --> 00:25:08,893
薪水是多少?
What's the pay like?

572
00:25:08,926 --> 00:25:10,027
好吧，我不在乎。
Well, I don't care.

573
00:25:10,061 --> 00:25:12,997
就是无薪实习!
Unpaid intern it is!

574
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,966
让我把它清理一下。
Let me clean this up.

575
00:25:22,173 --> 00:25:26,844
我叫你们来是想让你们知道…
I called you all here to let you know that...

576
00:25:26,877 --> 00:25:30,781
你今天剩下的时间可以休息。
that you have the rest of the day off.

577
00:25:30,815 --> 00:25:32,249
你疯了吗?
Are you out of your mind?

578
00:25:32,283 --> 00:25:34,752
如果我们休息几天，demo永远也准备不完。
We will never get the demo ready by taking days off.

579
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:36,821
我们甚至还没有开发Pixelcon展台。
We haven't even worked on our Pixelcon booth yet.

580
00:25:36,854 --> 00:25:38,923
我听说Xodus要给他们七位数的收入。
I heard Xodus is dropping seven figures on theirs.

581
00:25:38,956 --> 00:25:39,890
——七?-是的。
- Seven? - Yeah.

582
00:25:39,924 --> 00:25:40,958
凯特?
Kate?

583
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:48,532
也许下午休息一下也无妨。
Maybe it couldn't hurt to take the afternoon off.

584
00:25:48,566 --> 00:25:49,834
你知道的，好好享受一下。
You know, enjoy yourselves a little bit.

585
00:25:49,867 --> 00:25:51,135
你一直工作很努力。
You've been working so hard.

586
00:25:51,168 --> 00:25:53,004
去找点乐子。
Go have some fun.

587
00:25:53,037 --> 00:25:55,706
-你应得的。-你是认真的?
- You deserve it. - Are you serious?

588
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,174
-我在…——听起来糟透了。
- What am I... - Sounds terrible.

589
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:59,744
我家里有两个十几岁的孩子。
I have two teenagers at home.

590
00:25:59,777 --> 00:26:00,745
我从来没有休息过。
I've never had a day off.

591
00:26:00,778 --> 00:26:02,013
我们在做什么?
What are we doing?

592
00:26:02,046 --> 00:26:05,750
这是不好的。
This is bad.

593
00:26:05,783 --> 00:26:07,184
你疯了吗?
Have you lost your mind?

594
00:26:07,218 --> 00:26:09,887
我需要一些时间独自思考和工作
I need some time to think and work on my own

595
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,589
来解决这个问题。
to figure this out.

596
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:16,293
我爱你。开始工作。
I love you. Get to work.

597
00:26:29,774 --> 00:26:31,042
嘿，你的员工要去哪里?
Hey, where are your employees going?

598
00:26:31,075 --> 00:26:32,643
我说了他们想听的话。
I told them what they wanted to hear.

599
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:34,678
他们今天剩下的时间可以休息。
That they have the rest of the day off.

600
00:26:34,712 --> 00:26:37,081
哈!最好的老板!
Huh! Best boss ever!

601
00:26:37,114 --> 00:26:39,083
老兄,你猜怎么着?
Dude, guess what?

602
00:26:39,116 --> 00:26:41,786
我给自己找了一份独立的研究
I got myself an independent study

603
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:43,287
所以现在我也可以一直待在这里了。
so now I can be here all the time too.

604
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,022
信贷。
For credit.

605
00:26:45,056 --> 00:26:47,224
迪尔先生可能也能帮上忙。
You know, Mr. Diehl might be helpful too.

606
00:26:47,258 --> 00:26:48,859
他设计了第一人称游戏
He designed that first-person game

607
00:26:48,893 --> 00:26:50,895
我们小时候常玩的雅典娜9号
we used to play when we were kids, Athena 9.

608
00:26:50,928 --> 00:26:51,929
不。那很酷,
No. That's cool,

609
00:26:51,962 --> 00:26:55,599
但我认为编码与COBOL相比发生了一些变化。
but I think coding's changed a bit since COBOL.

610
00:26:55,633 --> 00:26:59,203
好吧。那这就是你的无薪实习生了
Okay. Uh, then this is your unpaid intern

611
00:26:59,236 --> 00:27:01,272
报告的责任。
reporting for duty.

612
00:27:01,305 --> 00:27:02,306
我应该从哪里开始呢?
Where should I start?

613
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:04,642
我可以采访你，然后一起切
I can interview you and start cutting together

614
00:27:04,675 --> 00:27:07,611
让我们来看看你迅速崛起的幕后故事……
a behind-the-scenes look at your meteoric rise...

615
00:27:07,645 --> 00:27:09,914
好主意。千万别这么做。
Good idea. Just really don't do that.

616
00:27:09,947 --> 00:27:11,849
好吧。
Okay.

617
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:13,818
你能给我一点独处的时间吗?
Can you just give me a little alone time?

618
00:27:13,851 --> 00:27:15,386
我真的得开始了。
I really need to get started on this.

619
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:20,024
好吧。对了,明白了。
Okay. Right, gotcha.

620
00:27:20,057 --> 00:27:21,192
酷。
Cool.

621
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:23,828
孤独。
Solitude.

622
00:27:23,861 --> 00:27:28,199
完全得到它。
Totally get it.

623
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,102
如果你需要我，我在实习部。
I'll be in the intern department if you need me.

624
00:27:31,135 --> 00:27:35,139
好吧?
All right?

625
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:55,292
不能发电子邮件?
Couldn't send an email?

626
00:28:08,205 --> 00:28:10,774
<i>♬直线♬</i>
<i>♪ Straight lines ♪</i>

627
00:28:10,808 --> 00:28:13,711
<i> </i> >展开你的翅膀，带我走吧
<i>♪ Spread your wings And carry me now ♪</i>

628
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,717
你让我感觉很好
<i>♪ You make me feel good You make me ♪</i>

629
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,852
<i>♬你想感觉良好</i>
<i>♪ You wanna feel good ♪</i>

630
00:28:41,473 --> 00:28:43,974
嘿，发生什么事了?
Hey, what's going on?

631
00:28:44,008 --> 00:28:45,910
我…我给员工放了几天假
I... I gave the staff a few days off

632
00:28:45,943 --> 00:28:47,311
这样我就能独立工作了
so I could work on my own.

633
00:28:47,344 --> 00:28:49,780
你不需要他们的帮助?
You don't need their help?

634
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:52,484
听起来既奇怪又孤独。
Sounds weird and lonely.

635
00:28:52,517 --> 00:28:53,817
介意我加入吗?
Mind if I join?

636
00:28:53,851 --> 00:28:54,919
——嗯…我不太……——谢谢!
- Uh... I'm not quite... - Thanks!

637
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:04,728
男人!
Man!

638
00:29:04,762 --> 00:29:06,297
我在学校上过几门编程课
I've taken a couple of coding classes at school

639
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:11,802
但是…这是一个疯狂的小镇。
but... this is crazy town.

640
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:14,071
这些都是你自己做的?
You did all this yourself?

641
00:29:14,104 --> 00:29:16,073
如何?
How?

642
00:29:16,106 --> 00:29:18,442
我也解释不清楚。
I can't really explain it.

643
00:29:18,476 --> 00:29:21,045
我听说我爸爸也是这样。
I heard my dad was the same way.

644
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:26,417
我不知道你爸怎么样，但是…
I don't know about your dad, but...

645
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:29,820
你妈妈给你打这针真是太棒了。
your mom is awesome for giving you this shot.

646
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:32,056
她这么信任你真是不可思议。
It's amazing how much she trusts you.

647
00:29:32,089 --> 00:29:34,992
我有点希望我能像你妈妈一样。
I kind of wish I could be like your mom, you know.

648
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:37,127
只要能站在一群人面前
Just being able to get up in front of a group of people

649
00:29:37,161 --> 00:29:39,063
并吸引所有人的注意。
and command everyone's attention.

650
00:29:39,096 --> 00:29:41,198
你为什么不可以呢?
Why can't you?

651
00:29:41,232 --> 00:29:42,534
我不知道。
I don't know.

652
00:29:42,567 --> 00:29:44,235
我想我是唱诗班的摇滚歌手，
I think I rock it in a choir,

653
00:29:44,268 --> 00:29:45,436
但当他们让我独唱时，
but when they ask me to sing solo though,

654
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:50,407
我只是有点……冻结。
I kinda just... freeze up.

655
00:29:50,441 --> 00:29:52,309
这和我的想法正好相反。
That's like the opposite of me.

656
00:29:52,343 --> 00:29:54,945
我只有一个人的时候才会编程。
I can only code when I'm on my own.

657
00:29:54,979 --> 00:29:57,014
你得告诉我你是怎么做到的。
Okay, you gotta tell me how you did this.

658
00:29:57,047 --> 00:29:59,016
比如你的大脑是怎么运作的。
Like how the hell your mind works.

659
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:01,018
都是0和1吗?
Is it all just zeros and ones?

660
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:02,286
有点。
Kinda.

661
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:04,154
编码的诀窍是理解
The trick to coding is understanding

662
00:30:04,188 --> 00:30:05,823
每件事都要有正确的顺序
that everything has to be in the right order

663
00:30:05,856 --> 00:30:07,459
否则就行不通了。
or it's not going to work.

664
00:30:07,492 --> 00:30:10,528
但我看到的不只是0和1。
But I don't just see zeros and ones.

665
00:30:10,562 --> 00:30:13,230
来，我来教你。
Here, let me show you.

666
00:30:13,264 --> 00:30:16,867
当我在编程时，我看到了一个完全不同的世界。
When I'm coding, I see a whole other world.

667
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,504
一个一切皆有可能的世界。
A world where anything is possible.

00:34:21,846 --> 00:34:23,715
凯特，我不知道你想让我们做什么。
Kate, I mean, I'm not sure what you expect us to do.

742
00:34:23,748 --> 00:34:25,048
他只花了我们两天时间。
He just cost us two days.

743
00:34:25,082 --> 00:34:26,518
没什么好炫耀的。
There's nothing to show for it.

744
00:34:26,551 --> 00:34:29,386
听着，我们让甘道夫带领我们越久，
Look, the longer we let Gandalf lead us,

745
00:34:29,419 --> 00:34:31,456
我们失去一切的机会就越大。
the greater our chance is we're gonna lose everything.

746
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:33,658
我们现在得把注意力集中到杰克豪斯身上!
We need to start focusing on Jackhouse now!

747
00:34:33,691 --> 00:34:36,293
吉米,Jackhouse糟透了。
Jimmy, Jackhouse sucks.

748
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:37,795
-不，他没有!——好吧,好吧。
- Oh no, he didn't! - Okay, okay.

749
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:40,732
这就够了。这两个你。好吧?
That's enough. Both of you. All right?

750
00:34:40,765 --> 00:34:44,234
让我给你看看我们面对的是什么。
Let me show you what we're up against.

751
00:34:47,137 --> 00:34:49,541
<i> >欢迎来到地狱星球
<i>Welcome to Planet Hell.</i>

752
00:34:54,344 --> 00:34:57,281
You will never be prepared.你永远不会有准备
<i>You will never be prepared.</i>

753
00:34:57,314 --> 00:34:59,717
哇，好多啊。
Whoa, that's a lot.

754
00:34:59,751 --> 00:35:03,153
<i> 1亿外星人
<i>One hundred million aliens.</i>

755
00:35:03,186 --> 00:35:05,557
外星人太多了!
There's too many aliens!

756
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:09,259
好了，现在让我痛苦地说清楚。
Okay, now to make it painfully clear.

757
00:35:10,562 --> 00:35:13,765
<我>粉碎,粉碎,粉碎。< / i >
<i>Smashing, smashing, smashing.</i>

758
00:35:16,266 --> 00:35:19,704
<我>粉碎,粉碎,粉碎。< / i >
<i>Smashing, smashing, smashing.</i>

759
00:35:19,737 --> 00:35:21,573
<我>粉碎,粉碎,粉碎。< / i >
<i>Smash, smash, smash.</i>

760
00:35:21,606 --> 00:35:24,341
特洛伊，说实话，在他们的帮助下，
Troy, can you honestly, with their help,

761
00:35:24,374 --> 00:35:26,811
所有这些都及时准备好了吗?
get all of this ready in time?

762
00:35:26,844 --> 00:35:28,445
绝对的。
Absolutely.

763
00:35:28,479 --> 00:35:30,648
我们需要的东西都贴在墙上了。
Everything we need is up on these walls.

764
00:35:30,682 --> 00:35:33,417
每个人的说明书上都标有自己的名字。
Everyone's instructions are labeled with their name.

765
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:38,155
那好吧，全速前进直到Pixelcon，好吗?
All right then, full speed 'til Pixelcon, okay?

766
00:35:38,188 --> 00:35:39,323
什么都没有。
Nothing else.

767
00:35:44,328 --> 00:35:48,566
对不起,吉米。
Sorry, Jimmy.

768
00:35:52,202 --> 00:35:53,905
Chay-roof吗?
Chay-roof?

769
00:35:53,938 --> 00:35:57,374
我敢肯定这里面肯定有个游戏
Well, I'm sure that there's a game somewhere

770
00:35:57,407 --> 00:35:58,710
在这个工艺品项目中，
in this arts and crafts project,

771
00:35:58,743 --> 00:36:00,812
但至少还有六个月。
but it's at least six months away.

772
00:36:00,845 --> 00:36:03,413
好吧。我们还有什么选择，吉米?
Okay. What choice do we have, Jimmy?

773
00:36:03,447 --> 00:36:06,450
在Jackhouse工作。
Work on Jackhouse.

774
00:36:06,484 --> 00:36:07,919
你也看到我们面对的是什么了。
You saw what we were up against.

775
00:36:13,558 --> 00:36:16,928
我就像在对着一堵墙说话。
It's like I'm talking to a wall.

776
00:36:16,961 --> 00:36:19,229
特洛伊，没用的。这些都不管用。
Troy, it's not working. None of this is working.

777
00:36:19,262 --> 00:36:21,231
伙计们，画得很清楚。
Guys, the drawings are crystal clear.

778
00:36:21,264 --> 00:36:22,366
是什么问题?
What's the problem?

779
00:36:22,399 --> 00:36:24,234
没有足够的内存来缓存所有这些资产。
There's not enough memory to cache all these assets.

780
00:36:24,267 --> 00:36:26,638
此外，我们还需要修复对库的API调用。
Also, we need to fix the API call to the library.

781
00:36:26,671 --> 00:36:27,705
太空巫师是如何叙事的
How does the space wizard narrative

782
00:36:27,739 --> 00:36:28,873
与城堡故事相吻合?
dovetail into the castle story?

783
00:36:28,906 --> 00:36:31,241
伙计们,伙计们!
Guys, guys!

784
00:36:31,274 --> 00:36:32,209
能占用你一分钟吗?
Can I have a minute?

785
00:36:32,242 --> 00:36:34,712
独自一人吗?
Alone, please?

786
00:36:34,746 --> 00:36:35,913
好吧，但有很多东西
Okay, but there's a lot of stuff

787
00:36:35,947 --> 00:36:37,515
-这说不通啊。——请。
- that doesn't make any sense. - Please.

788
00:36:37,548 --> 00:36:39,684
它的形状有两个选择。
There's two options of the shape of it.

789
00:36:39,717 --> 00:36:41,284
我没见过那把斧头。我很高兴那不是我的。
I haven't seen that axe. I'm glad it's not mine.

790
00:36:41,318 --> 00:36:43,220
我一整天都在看这个，
I've been looking at this all day,

791
00:36:43,253 --> 00:36:45,590
这说不通啊。
and it doesn't make any sense.

792
00:36:48,726 --> 00:36:50,795
妈妈……
Mom...

793
00:36:50,828 --> 00:36:53,831
这些人，他们不…他们他们已经…
these people, they don't... they they're already just...

794
00:36:53,865 --> 00:36:55,198
我就不能自己做吗?
can't I just do this on my own?

795
00:36:55,232 --> 00:36:57,367
他们只会让我慢下来。
They're just going to slow me down.

796
00:36:57,401 --> 00:36:59,671
亲爱的，我也说过同样的话
Honey, I had this exact same conversation

797
00:36:59,704 --> 00:37:01,371
你父亲就在这个房间里
with your father right in this very room

798
00:37:01,405 --> 00:37:02,774
12年前,
12 years ago,

799
00:37:02,807 --> 00:37:04,509
他最终意识到了这点
and he eventually realized that

800
00:37:04,542 --> 00:37:06,978
他们都有自己的贡献。
they all have something to contribute.

801
00:37:07,011 --> 00:37:08,980
你能想个办法和他们合作吗?
Could you please figure out a way to work with them?

802
00:37:09,013 --> 00:37:10,581
我可以试一试。
I can try.

803
00:37:10,615 --> 00:37:12,684
你应该做得比尝试更好。
You gotta do better than try.

804
00:37:12,717 --> 00:37:15,419
这些人也是我的家人。
These people are also family to me.

805
00:37:15,453 --> 00:37:17,922
我知道,妈妈。
I know, Mom.

806
00:37:17,955 --> 00:37:19,490
我知道。
I know.

807
00:37:19,524 --> 00:37:21,559
和吉米。
And Jimmy too.

808
00:37:21,592 --> 00:37:24,294
你把他的工作搞得一团糟。
You kinda took a crap all over his work.

809
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:25,129
他心烦意乱。
He's upset.

810
00:37:25,163 --> 00:37:27,264
我以为那家伙是刀枪不入的。
I thought that guy was bulletproof.

811
00:37:27,297 --> 00:37:29,000
如果你在做某件事，你会有什么感觉
How would you feel if you worked on something

812
00:37:29,033 --> 00:37:30,535
一年多来，
for over a year,

813
00:37:30,568 --> 00:37:33,538
有个年轻的高手进来了，年纪只有你一半，
and some young hotshot came in, half your age,

814
00:37:33,571 --> 00:37:35,606
然后完全撕碎?
and completely shredded it?

815
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,407
那孩子应该八岁
Well, that kid would be eight,

816
00:37:37,441 --> 00:37:38,509
那将是不可思议的。
and that would be incredible.

817
00:37:38,543 --> 00:37:42,647
好吧，但吉米是个很有天赋的游戏设计师。
Okay, but Jimmy is a really talented game designer.

818
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,782
他是。只是我们走错了路
He is. It's just we went down the wrong path

819
00:37:44,816 --> 00:37:46,751
和他在一起太久了。
with him for too long.

820
00:37:46,784 --> 00:37:50,722
总之，总有一天，你会需要吉米的帮助。
Anyway, at some point, you are gonna need Jimmy's help.

821
00:37:50,755 --> 00:37:53,290
好吧,我试试看。
Okay, I'll try.

822
00:37:53,323 --> 00:37:55,425
我是说，我会的。
I mean, I will.

823
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,930
好吧。
Okay.

824
00:37:58,963 --> 00:38:00,531
啊,妈妈?
Ah, Mom?

825
00:38:00,565 --> 00:38:02,967
是的。
Yeah.

826
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,968
再次感谢。
Thanks again.

827
00:38:04,001 --> 00:38:05,470
没什么。
It's nothing.

828
00:38:10,675 --> 00:38:12,577
特洛伊，过来。
Troy, get over here.

829
00:38:25,656 --> 00:38:28,526
那么，药物有帮助吗?
So, are the meds helping?

830
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:30,561
因为你看起来很糟。
'Cause you look terrible.

831
00:38:30,595 --> 00:38:33,564
这是你的专业医学意见吗?
Is that your professional medical opinion?

832
00:38:33,598 --> 00:38:34,966
凯特…
Kate...

833
00:38:34,999 --> 00:38:38,435
在最糟糕的时候，多发性硬化症会露出丑陋的头。
MS rears its ugly head at the worst times.

834
00:38:38,469 --> 00:38:40,872
你只需要多休息。
You just need to get more rest.

835
00:38:40,905 --> 00:38:42,840
医生的命令。
Doctor's orders.

836
00:38:42,874 --> 00:38:45,476
我是你的医生。
And I'm your doctor.

837
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:47,712
我们不能再这样见面了。
We have to stop meeting like this.

838
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:55,720
距离Pixelcon还有20天。
Pixelcon is 20 days away.

839
00:38:55,753 --> 00:38:57,088
网络上在热议什么?
What's the Internet buzzing about?

840
00:38:57,121 --> 00:38:58,256
球场的新游戏,
Playfield's new game,

841
00:38:58,288 --> 00:39:00,958
我讨厌听到的关于这东西的每一件事。
I hate every single thing I'm hearing about this thing.

842
00:39:00,992 --> 00:39:02,994
不好的。肯定不是很好。
Not good. Definitely not good.

843
00:39:03,027 --> 00:39:05,696
我已经……我从来没有对电子游戏如此兴奋过
I've... literally never been more excited for a video game

844
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:07,899
比我对Xodus的外星收割者更有信心。
than I am for Xodus' Alien Reaper.

845
00:39:07,932 --> 00:39:09,100
我现在就要。
I need it now.

846
00:39:09,133 --> 00:39:10,735
《外星死神》就是这样的游戏
Alien Reaper is the kind of game

847
00:39:10,768 --> 00:39:12,870
你最好的噩梦都是由它组成的。
that your best nightmares are made of.

848
00:39:12,904 --> 00:39:14,672
我听说Xodus花了一千万美元
I heard Xodus spent 10 million dollars

849
00:39:14,705 --> 00:39:16,507
只在过场动画上。
on the cut scenes alone.

850
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:18,009
当你在一个游戏上投入那么多钱时，
When you're dropping that kind of cash on a game,

851
00:39:18,042 --> 00:39:20,343
对于独立开发者来说，竞争是不可能的。
it is impossible for the indies to compete.

852
00:39:20,377 --> 00:39:22,345
老实说，操场看起来一团糟。
Honestly, Playfield is looking like a mess.

853
00:39:22,379 --> 00:39:23,446
没有好,朋友。
No bueno, friends.

854
00:39:23,481 --> 00:39:25,616
求你了，操场，求你乖乖的。
Please, Playfield, please be good.

855
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,718
要比最近更好。
Be better than you've been recently.

856
00:39:27,752 --> 00:39:29,787
- <i>You were so great…< / i >——嘿。
- <i>You were so great...</i> - Hey.

857
00:39:29,821 --> 00:39:30,955
-…<i>回到以前。</i> -你在看什么?
- ... <i>back in the day.</i> - What'cha looking at?

858
00:39:30,988 --> 00:39:33,925
球迷们的期望让我很紧张。
Just getting nervous over all the fans' expectations.

859
00:39:33,958 --> 00:39:35,893
我明白了。
Yeah, I get it.

860
00:39:35,927 --> 00:39:37,695
你不想让任何人失望。
You don't want to let anyone down.

861
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,729
是的,有人吗?
Yeah, does anyone?

862
00:39:38,763 --> 00:39:40,731
呃，我有点习惯了。
Eh, I'm kinda used to it.

863
00:39:40,765 --> 00:39:41,666
相信我。
Believe me.

864
00:39:41,699 --> 00:39:43,601
特洛伊，我不明白你那愚蠢的海报!
Troy, I don't understand your dumb poster!

865
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:46,604
我恨你逼我这么做!
I hate you for making me do this!

866
00:39:46,637 --> 00:39:50,107
我给你看样东西。
Hey, let me show you something.

867
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:52,009
我能看看你的手机吗?
Can I see your phone?

868
00:39:52,043 --> 00:39:53,544
是的。
Yeah.

869
00:39:53,578 --> 00:39:56,647
酷,嗯…
Cool, um...

870
00:39:56,681 --> 00:39:57,682
在那里。
There.

871
00:39:57,715 --> 00:40:00,450
检查出来。
Check it out.

872
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:02,787
它是什么?
What is it?

873
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,656
这是一个定制的增强现实程序
It's a custom augmented reality program

874
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:06,991
怯场。
for stage fright.

875
00:40:07,024 --> 00:40:08,125
是啊，他们说最好的办法是
Yeah, they say the best thing to do

876
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:10,595
就是在人群中专注于一个人。
is focus on one person in a crowd.

877
00:40:10,628 --> 00:40:11,562
找一张友善的脸
Find a friendly face

878
00:40:11,596 --> 00:40:14,065
就好像你只跟他们说话一样。
and it's like you're only talking to them.

879
00:40:14,098 --> 00:40:15,566
我都不知道他们有这个。
I didn't even know they had those.

880
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,601
不,他们没有。
No, they don't.

881
00:40:16,634 --> 00:40:18,536
但我……这是我做的。
But I... I built this one.

882
00:40:18,569 --> 00:40:22,640
给你。
For you.

883
00:40:22,673 --> 00:40:24,976
你哪来的时间?
Where did you find the time?

884
00:40:25,009 --> 00:40:25,776
我挤出了时间。
I made the time.

885
00:40:30,848 --> 00:40:33,651
嗯,我要……
Uh, I gotta...

886
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:35,987
-是的。-是的。
- Yeah. - Yeah.

887
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,722
谢谢你！
Thank you.

888
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:43,694
是的，是的，进来吧。
Yeah, yeah, come on in.

889
00:40:48,799 --> 00:40:50,101
是的，特洛伊，整个部分
So yeah, Troy, that whole section

890
00:40:50,134 --> 00:40:51,936
在站立会议上没有提到。
was not covered in the stand-up meeting.

891
00:40:51,969 --> 00:40:53,704
这还不包括我们一直在做的事情。
That doesn't factor in what we've been working on.

892
00:40:53,738 --> 00:40:54,872
我还有一个问题关于……
I have another question about...

893
00:40:54,906 --> 00:40:55,873
拜托!
Please!

894
00:41:00,044 --> 00:41:02,880
螺丝。
Screw it.

895
00:41:04,482 --> 00:41:05,216
我知道,这是……这是一个不同的…
I know, it's... it's a different...

896
00:41:05,249 --> 00:41:06,183
这将是一件不同的事情。
it's gonna be a different thing.

897
00:41:06,217 --> 00:41:07,752
特洛伊，我们得谈谈。
Troy, we need to talk.

898
00:41:07,785 --> 00:41:09,520
我现在没时间，吉米。
I don't have any time right now, Jimmy.

899
00:41:09,553 --> 00:41:11,656
有一条线。而我在这上面。
There's a line. And I'm at the top of it.

900
00:41:11,689 --> 00:41:14,025
我说了我们得谈谈。
I said we need to talk.

901
00:41:14,058 --> 00:41:16,727
爸爸?
Daddy?

902
00:41:16,761 --> 00:41:17,962
艾米丽，你在这干嘛?
Emily, what are you doing here?

903
00:41:17,995 --> 00:41:19,563
我和爷爷一起来的。
I came with Grandpa.

904
00:41:19,597 --> 00:41:20,798
他在你办公室等着呢。
He's waiting in your office.

905
00:41:20,831 --> 00:41:23,701
啊…好吧。
Ah... okay.

906
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:25,503
我马上回来。
I'm gonna be right back.

907
00:41:25,536 --> 00:41:29,907
艾米你在那等着好吗
Em, you just wait there, okay?

908
00:41:32,143 --> 00:41:35,112
<我>粉碎,粉碎,粉碎。< / i >
<i>Smashing, smashing, smashing.</i>

909
00:41:35,146 --> 00:41:38,549
<我>粉碎,粉碎,粉碎。粉碎。< / i >
<i>Smash, smash, smash. Smashing.</i>

910
00:41:38,582 --> 00:41:40,584
先生,你早。
Sir, you're early.

911
00:41:40,618 --> 00:41:42,987
房地产有自己的运行时间表，吉米。
Real estate operates on its own timetable, Jimmy.

912
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,523
我还是不敢相信我唯一的儿子
I still can't believe my only son

913
00:41:45,556 --> 00:41:48,059
以玩电子游戏为生。
plays video games for a living.

914
00:41:48,092 --> 00:41:50,094
你什么时候才能长大，找份真正的工作?
When are you going to grow up and get a real job?

915
00:41:50,127 --> 00:41:52,563
爸爸，这是份真正的工作。
Dad, this is a real job.

916
00:41:52,596 --> 00:41:54,632
不如你下个月来Pixelcon吧
You know what, why don't you come to Pixelcon next month

917
00:41:54,665 --> 00:41:55,933
我会让你看看我能做什么
and I'll show you what I can do.

918
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,201
——小精灵吗?——Pixelcon。
- Pixie cut? - Pixelcon.

919
00:41:57,234 --> 00:41:59,937
这是一个大型电子游戏大会我要在那里首次推出这个游戏
It's a big video game convention where I'm gonna debut the game

920
00:41:59,971 --> 00:42:01,172
我一整年都在做的事
I've been workin' on all year.

921
00:42:01,205 --> 00:42:03,841
一年吗?在一场比赛吗?
One year? On one game?

922
00:42:03,874 --> 00:42:06,277
这整个环境让我感到恶心。
This whole environment makes me sick to my stomach.

923
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,946
我只希望艾米丽不要…
I just hope that Emily doesn't...

924
00:42:10,614 --> 00:42:11,582
哦，管它呢。
Oh, the hell with it.

925
00:42:11,615 --> 00:42:13,751
不,继续。说出来。
No, go on. Say it.

926
00:42:13,784 --> 00:42:15,753
你希望艾米丽不会什么?
You hope that Emily doesn't what?

927
00:42:15,786 --> 00:42:18,622
我希望她不会思考
I hope that she doesn't think

928
00:42:18,656 --> 00:42:21,692
这就是现实世界的运作方式。
this is how the real world works.

929
00:42:31,669 --> 00:42:33,104
艾米，你拿的是什么?
Hey Em, what've you got there?

930
00:42:33,137 --> 00:42:35,573
这是赛尔达的N64模拟器。
It's an N64 emulator of Zelda.

931
00:42:35,606 --> 00:42:37,241
陶笛吗?
Ocarina?

932
00:42:37,274 --> 00:42:39,910
宫本茂。
Shigeru Miyamoto.

933
00:42:41,278 --> 00:42:43,981
没有他，开放世界根本就不存在。
Without him, open worlds wouldn't even exist.

934
00:42:44,015 --> 00:42:45,316
我听说第一部很有灵感
Yeah, I heard the first one was inspired

935
00:42:45,349 --> 00:42:47,251
因为他喜欢洞穴探险。
by his love of spelunking.

936
00:42:47,284 --> 00:42:49,253
优秀的设计师是基于自己的游戏
Well, the great designers base their games

937
00:42:49,286 --> 00:42:53,557
他们喜欢的东西，那个人喜欢洞穴探险。
on stuff they love, and that man loved spelunking.

938
00:42:53,591 --> 00:42:56,727
听着，我们得转移注意力。
Look, we need to shift our focus.

939
00:42:56,761 --> 00:43:00,631
我们需要创造一个可玩的Jackhouse演示版本。
We need to build a playable demo of Jackhouse.

940
00:43:00,664 --> 00:43:02,033
——什么?-更近了
- What? - It's much closer

941
00:43:02,066 --> 00:43:03,601
而不是《特洛伊世界》
than World of Troy.

942
00:43:03,634 --> 00:43:04,769
Yort。
Yort.

943
00:43:04,802 --> 00:43:05,669
是的,不管。
Yeah, whatever.

944
00:43:05,703 --> 00:43:06,537
听着，如果我们不完成其中一个游戏，
Look, if we don't finish one of the games,

945
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:08,272
我们什么都卖不出去了。
we're not gonna have anything to sell.

946
00:43:08,305 --> 00:43:09,173
我知道。
I know that.

947
00:43:09,206 --> 00:43:12,843
所以我们必须干掉尤尔特。
Which is why we have to finish Yort.

948
00:43:12,877 --> 00:43:15,579
你为什么不想参与我的游戏?
Why don't you want to work on my game?

949
00:43:15,613 --> 00:43:18,682
吉米，先别管漏洞和可扩展性了
Jimmy, forget about the bugs and the scalability for a second

950
00:43:18,716 --> 00:43:20,885
想想看。
and just think about it.

951
00:43:20,918 --> 00:43:22,720
谁想玩一款唯一目标的游戏
Who wants to play a game where your only goal

952
00:43:22,753 --> 00:43:23,954
是要毁坏房屋吗?
is to destroy houses?

953
00:43:23,988 --> 00:43:27,024
我猜每个人都想成为神奇的树蛞蝓
Oh, and I guess everybody wants to be a magical tree slug

954
00:43:27,058 --> 00:43:31,028
穿越时间去寻找神秘的野兽?
flying through time in search of a mystical beast?

955
00:43:31,062 --> 00:43:33,798
嗯,有点。
Well, kinda.

956
00:43:33,831 --> 00:43:35,833
这是我唯一的一份工作。
This is the only job I've ever had.

957
00:43:35,866 --> 00:43:37,134
我帮助建立了这家公司。
I helped build this company.

958
00:43:37,168 --> 00:43:38,903
我现在有了自己的家庭
I have my own family now,

959
00:43:38,936 --> 00:43:42,073
你还逼我做我不想做的事!
and you are making me do something I don't wanna do!

960
00:43:42,106 --> 00:43:43,774
吉米，你没有迷你游戏
Jimmy, you have no mini-games,

961
00:43:43,808 --> 00:43:46,343
没有分段，就没有经济。
no subsections, no economy.

962
00:43:46,377 --> 00:43:48,913
电钻是唯一的核心循环。
Jackhammering is your only core loop.

963
00:43:48,946 --> 00:43:51,148
就好像你忘记了这些游戏是关于什么的。
It's like you forgot what these games are all about.

964
00:43:57,755 --> 00:43:59,356
哦,来吧。
Em, come on.

965
00:44:04,361 --> 00:44:06,597
怎么了,吉米?今天要花半天时间?
What's up, Jimmy? Takin' a half day today?

Oh, oh, upload and boom.

984
00:45:14,932 --> 00:45:17,201
你有时间吗?
Hey, you got a sec?

985
00:45:17,234 --> 00:45:18,836
是的，是的，我喜欢。我确实有时间。
Yeah, yeah, I do. I do have a sec.

00:45:18,869 --> 00:45:20,171
我有很多秒。
I have a ton of secs.

987
00:45:20,204 --> 00:45:22,373
事实上，我有很多秒。
In fact, I have like all the secs.

988
00:45:25,843 --> 00:45:27,411
嗯…(我不是那个意思。)
Um... that is not what I meant.

989
00:45:27,444 --> 00:45:31,749
你把事情搞得很诡异。
You do a really good job at making things weird.

990
00:45:31,782 --> 00:45:32,917
谢谢你！
Thank you.

991
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:36,220
我只是来告诉你，我报名了我的第一个独唱。
I just came to tell you, I signed up for my first solo.

992
00:45:36,253 --> 00:45:38,822
很神奇的。
Amazing.

993
00:45:40,824 --> 00:45:42,159
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

994
00:45:42,193 --> 00:45:45,029
只是…每个人都远远落在后面
Just... everyone's falling so far behind

995
00:45:45,062 --> 00:45:48,032
我只是…我没法让他们拿到。
and I just... I can't get them to get it.

996
00:45:48,065 --> 00:45:50,468
是的,我听说过。
Yeah, I heard.

997
00:45:50,502 --> 00:45:51,902
你的计划是什么?
So, what's your plan?

998
00:45:51,936 --> 00:45:53,771
既然我没法让他们理解，
Well, since I can't get them to understand,

999
00:45:53,804 --> 00:45:55,873
今晚我会自己修复核心渲染引擎
I'll fix the core rendering engine myself tonight

1000
00:45:55,906 --> 00:45:56,675
然后可能只是…
then probably just...

1001
00:45:56,707 --> 00:45:59,443
——嘿,嘿!-…多工作一点……
- Hey, hey! - ...work a bit more...

1002
00:45:59,477 --> 00:46:02,980
我才来了两周，
I've only been here like two weeks so,

1003
00:46:03,013 --> 00:46:04,381
也许我不知道，
maybe I don't know,

1004
00:46:04,415 --> 00:46:08,752
但我从没见过你向别人求助。
but I've never seen you ask for help from anyone.

1005
00:46:09,353 --> 00:46:10,321
特洛伊?
Troy?

1006
00:46:11,822 --> 00:46:12,923
特洛伊。
Troy.

1007
00:46:12,957 --> 00:46:16,260
也许从现在开始。
Maybe start now.

1008
00:46:16,293 --> 00:46:17,895
好吧，听着，这机会不大，
Okay, listen, this is a long shot,

1009
00:46:17,928 --> 00:46:19,531
但我一直在看吉米的杰克豪斯地图
but I've been going over Jimmy's Jackhouse maps

1010
00:46:19,564 --> 00:46:21,298
如果我们让他们改信尤尔
and if we convert them for Yort,

1011
00:46:21,332 --> 00:46:23,267
我们可以在一周内完成6个关卡。
we could get six levels in a week.

1012
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,802
真的吗?那么快?
Really? That much that fast?

1013
00:46:24,835 --> 00:46:25,970
这意味着……
Which means...

1014
00:46:26,003 --> 00:46:29,273
我们这周就能完成我的游戏。
We would finish my game this week.

1015
00:46:29,306 --> 00:46:31,442
那太棒了。
That would be awesome.

1016
00:46:31,476 --> 00:46:33,344
好吧，我会让玛丽开始查的。
Okay, well, I'll get Marie started on that.

1017
00:46:33,377 --> 00:46:35,112
谢谢你,劳拉。
Thanks, Laura.

1018
00:46:35,145 --> 00:46:39,817
我真的以为你不喜欢我。
I really thought you didn't like me.

1019
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:40,985
我不。
I do not.

1020
00:46:41,018 --> 00:46:42,554
我这么做是为了凯特。
I'm doing this for Kate.

1021
00:46:42,587 --> 00:46:45,557
密码?
Password?

1022
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:48,526
玛丽，我需要你的帮助。
Hey, Marie, I need your help.

1023
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,528
我的天，终于来了。
Oh my gosh, finally.

1024
00:46:50,562 --> 00:46:51,563
我知道只要我有耐心，
I knew that if I was just patient,

1025
00:46:51,596 --> 00:46:53,163
我最终会有机会的
I would eventually get my chance

1026
00:46:53,197 --> 00:46:54,798
对了，我有一些关于约特的好主意。
and, hey, I have some great ideas for Yort.

1027
00:46:54,832 --> 00:46:55,766
我相信你会的，
I'm sure you do,

1028
00:46:55,799 --> 00:46:56,735
但我现在真正需要你做的是
but what I really need you to do right now

1029
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,369
是要重制杰克豪斯的故事线吗
is to rework the storylines from Jackhouse

1030
00:46:58,402 --> 00:47:00,472
与尤特同步。
to sync with Yort.

1031
00:47:00,505 --> 00:47:01,506
明白了。
Gotcha.

1032
00:47:01,539 --> 00:47:05,042
好，我把这些概念都归档
Okay, so I'll just file away all these concepts

1033
00:47:05,075 --> 00:47:07,077
我一直在头脑风暴。
that I've been brainstorming.

1034
00:47:07,111 --> 00:47:09,380
谢谢你,玛丽!
Thanks, Marie!

1035
00:47:09,413 --> 00:47:12,149
什么……
What the...

1036
00:47:12,182 --> 00:47:13,851
什么……?
What the...?

1037
00:47:13,884 --> 00:47:15,587
抱歉，林登。
Hey, sorry about that, Lyndon.

1038
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,254
-这是怎么回事?——我们的财务。

1039
00:47:17,288 --> 00:47:19,990
我得把它们传真给Xodus。

1040

我们没有传真机。
We don't have a fax machine.

1041
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:25,129
我一直在用什么?
Well, what've I been using?

1042
00:47:25,162 --> 00:47:27,264
你为什么要把我们的财务报表发给Xodus?
Why are you sending our financials to Xodus?

1043
00:47:27,298 --> 00:47:31,335
儿子，你妈还能怎么保住你的房子?
Son, how else is your mom gonna keep your house?

1044
00:47:33,904 --> 00:47:37,141

00:47:39,376 --> 00:47:41,412
妈，你把我们的房子抵押了?

尤尔特就要准备好了。

劳拉和玛丽终于开始明白了
Laura and Marie are finally starting to get it

1052

就连吉米和我也有点亲密了

1053
00:47:55,627 --> 00:47:58,563
所以…别担心,妈妈。
So... don't worry, Mom.

1054
00:47:58,596 --> 00:48:00,197
You're dealing with so much.(你应付的太多了。
<i>You're dealing with so much.</i>

1055
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:02,500
对不起，我的医生不让我去办公室
<i>I'm sorry, but my doctor won't let me go to the office</i>

1056
00:48:02,534 --> 00:48:04,569

你让我的生活变得比以前难了十倍。

没有什么!
Nothing!

1083

因为你什么也做不了。
Because there's nothing you can do.

1084
00:49:21,746 --> 00:49:24,314
我要回学校了。
I'm going back to school.

1085

吉米?什么?
Jimmy? What?

好吧，我来做你的性格测试。
Okay, I'll do your personality quiz.

1091
00:49:50,542 --> 00:49:53,076
“你是哪个《老友记》角色?”
"Which <i>Friends</i> character are you?"

1092
00:50:04,054 --> 00:50:05,355
是的,好的。
Yes, okay.

1093
00:50:07,357 --> 00:50:08,626
Chandler到底是谁?
Who the hell is Chandler?

1094
00:50:10,294 --> 00:50:12,697
很好，当然，死亡之球。
Ah, great, of course, beachball of death.

1095
00:50:32,416 --> 00:50:34,719
不。不，不，不，不，不!
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1096
00:50:34,752 --> 00:50:35,887
玛丽,有什么事吗?
Marie, what's up?

1097
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,455
我的电脑在工作的中途死机了，
My computer just froze up in the middle of everything,

1098
00:50:37,489 --> 00:50:39,223
而且它不让我重启。
and it's not letting me reboot.

1099
00:50:39,256 --> 00:50:41,358
呃,我……我也一样。
Uh, me... me too, the same thing.

1100
00:50:41,391 --> 00:50:42,694
特洛伊，你做了什么?
Troy, what did you do?

1101
00:50:42,727 --> 00:50:43,795
你什么意思?我的电脑冻结了,
What do you mean? My computer froze,

1102
00:50:43,828 --> 00:50:45,563
所以我正要去厨房吃点东西。
so I was just going to the kitchen to get a snack.

1103
00:50:45,597 --> 00:50:47,264
它不是冷冻的，它是条虫子。
It's not frozen, it's a worm.

1104
00:50:47,297 --> 00:50:48,700
什么?不，那不可能。
What? No, that's not possible.

1105
00:50:48,733 --> 00:50:50,100
你把你的电脑设置成集线器
You set up your computer to be the hub

1106
00:50:50,133 --> 00:50:53,036
专门的网络，记得吗?
of the dedicated network, remember?

1107
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:56,641
哦,不。
Oh, no.

1108
00:50:59,811 --> 00:51:01,513
它粘在这个网页上了。
It's stuck on this webpage.

1109
00:51:01,546 --> 00:51:03,313
劳拉是正确的!你下载了一个蠕虫!
Laura's right! You downloaded a worm!

1110
00:51:03,347 --> 00:51:04,314
它会吞噬我们的网络
It's gonna eat through our network

1111
00:51:04,348 --> 00:51:05,215
摧毁我们所有的硬件。
and destroy all of our hardware.

1112
00:51:05,249 --> 00:51:07,117
-我们得切断电源!——对,好吧!
- We need to cut the power! - Right, okay!

1113
00:51:08,385 --> 00:51:09,386
不是你的力量!
Not your power!

1114
00:51:09,419 --> 00:51:14,391
我们得切断整栋楼的电源!
We need to cut the power to the whole building!

1115
00:51:14,424 --> 00:51:15,527
蠕虫?
A worm?

1116
00:51:41,486 --> 00:51:43,688
做了……我们及时阻止了吗?
Did... did we stop it in time?

1117
00:51:43,721 --> 00:51:44,856
怎么会这样呢?
How could this happen?

1118
00:51:44,889 --> 00:51:47,291
特洛伊，你离开办公室之前在做什么?
Troy, what were you doing before you left your office?

1119
00:51:48,425 --> 00:51:49,527
什么都没有。我…
Nothing. I'd...

1120
00:51:49,561 --> 00:51:52,429
我打开了吉米的一封邮件，里面有一个链接。
I'd opened an email from Jimmy that had a link in it.

1121
00:51:52,463 --> 00:51:53,397
他不会。
He wouldn't.

1122
00:51:54,532 --> 00:51:56,166
——没有。-他看起来很生气
- No way. - He seemed pretty pissed

1123
00:51:56,199 --> 00:51:58,168
就在他离开之前。
right before he left.

1124
00:51:58,201 --> 00:51:59,303
他留下了这张纸条。
He left this note.

1125
00:52:06,511 --> 00:52:08,412
林登，再打开断路器。
Lyndon, go flip the breaker again.

1126
00:52:08,445 --> 00:52:10,213
特洛伊，什么都别碰。
Troy, don't touch anything.

1127
00:52:10,247 --> 00:52:12,115
让我们看看造成了多大的伤害。
Let's see how much damage was done.

1128
00:52:12,149 --> 00:52:13,417
断路器。
Breaker.

1129
00:52:40,578 --> 00:52:42,747
这些计算机完全瘫痪了。
The computers are completely fried.

1130
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,482
甚至备份服务器。
Even the backup servers.

1131
00:52:44,515 --> 00:52:46,651
一切都消失了。
Everything's gone.

1132
00:52:46,684 --> 00:52:48,720
但是,呃…这是不是意味着……
But, uh... does this mean...

1133
00:52:48,753 --> 00:52:51,823
我们从两场比赛到零场比赛。
We went from two games to none.

1134
00:52:51,856 --> 00:52:55,460
我们……我们得告诉凯特。
We... we gotta tell Kate.

1135
00:52:58,663 --> 00:53:00,665
我会告诉她的。
I'll tell her.

1136
00:53:00,698 --> 00:53:02,332
嗯。
Huh.

1137
00:53:20,718 --> 00:53:23,253
特洛伊，亲爱的，是你吗?< / i >
<i>Troy, honey, is that you?</i>

1138
00:53:23,286 --> 00:53:24,555
是的，妈妈，是我。
Yeah, Mom, it's me.

1139
00:53:32,295 --> 00:53:35,800
很抱歉这么长时间没上网了。
I'm sorry I've been offline for such a long time now.

1140
00:53:37,468 --> 00:53:42,205
我还没有……我好久没发作得这么厉害了。
I haven't... I haven't had a flare-up this bad in forever.

1141
00:53:49,914 --> 00:53:51,348
Yort会怎么样?
How's Yort going?

1142
00:53:52,449 --> 00:53:53,484
很好。
It's good.

1143
00:53:53,518 --> 00:53:55,820
我只是希望我能多帮点忙。
I just wish I could help more.

1144
00:53:55,853 --> 00:53:57,955
你有什么想说的吗?
Is there anything you want to talk about?

1145
00:53:57,989 --> 00:54:00,758
嗯…不是真的。
Um... not really.

1146
00:54:02,894 --> 00:54:05,630
我只是想确认你感觉好些了
I just wanted to make sure you're feeling better

1147
00:54:05,663 --> 00:54:08,466
这样你就可以在主要活动上展示了。
so you can present at the main event.

1148
00:54:08,499 --> 00:54:10,935
你确定在那之前我不在你能行吗?
Are you sure you'll be okay without me until then?

1149
00:54:10,968 --> 00:54:13,004
好的，我知道了。
Yeah, I got it.

1150
00:54:13,037 --> 00:54:16,306
我只是…只是来拿套换洗衣服
I was just... just coming to get a change of clothes

1151
00:54:16,339 --> 00:54:18,275
我就回办公室了

看起来你正在做
It looks like you're doing

1160

some serious housecleaning out there.

1161

是一个u盘，还有一盘混音带。

再也没有约特了，佩吉。

00:59:34,859 --> 00:59:38,295
我只是顺路过来看看有没有什么东西。

所以，我来学校不是为了玩…无论什么。

和其他新朋友一起玩。

1230
00:59:59,383 --> 01:00:02,887
你知道那个视频给我带来了一万名新订户吗?

嗨,尼克。我…我明白了。

你拍那个视频只是为了帮我。
You were only making that video 'cause you wanted to help me.

1236
01:00:14,932 --> 01:00:17,001
我在操场的时候脑子不太清楚，好吗?
I was in way over my head at Playfield, all right?

1237

我不该说那些话的
I shouldn't have said any of the things

1238

我做了这个视频。
I made the video.

1240

你叫我别这么做的。但我还是做了。

这是我的不好。我很抱歉。
That's my bad. I'm sorry.

1242
01:00:28,279 --> 01:00:30,915
尼克，我不知道还能找谁。
Nick, I just, I didn't know who else to turn to.

1243
01:00:30,948 --> 01:00:32,683
Yort是完蛋了。
Yort is screwed.

1244
01:00:32,716 --> 01:00:33,918
我下载了这个蠕虫
I downloaded this worm,

1245
01:00:33,951 --> 01:00:35,886
和…我们的电脑都坏了。
and... and our computers just got fried.

1246
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,155
我告诉过你不要去那些网站。
I told you not to visit those sites.

1247
01:00:38,189 --> 01:00:40,624
尼克，我们的游戏输掉了密码。
Nick, we lost the code to our games.

1248
01:00:40,658 --> 01:00:41,759
整个代码?
The entire code?

1249
01:00:41,792 --> 01:00:43,694
是的。

01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:46,997
我只是…我需要有人帮我弄清楚下一步该做什么。
I just... I need some help figuring out what to do next.

1251
01:00:48,432 --> 01:00:49,233
你说你需要帮助?
You said you need help?

1252
01:00:49,266 --> 01:00:51,702
-是的。是的。-你说你需要帮助。
- Yeah. Yes. - You said you need help.

1253
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:53,270
我得到了你的帮助!来吧!
I got your help! Come on!

1254
01:00:55,372 --> 01:00:56,640
哦!
Oh!

1255

嗨,迪先生。迪先生吗?

1257
01:01:00,845 --> 01:01:01,912
梅菲尔德吗?
Mayfield?

1258
01:01:01,946 --> 01:01:03,114
我以为你被停职了?
I thought you were suspended?

1259
01:01:03,147 --> 01:01:04,782
春假。
It's spring break.

1260
01:01:04,815 --> 01:01:06,016
一遍吗?
Again?

1261
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:09,220
迪尔先生偷偷溜过来跟你玩电子游戏。
Look, Mr. Diehl sneaks away here to play your video games.

1262
01:01:09,253 --> 01:01:11,155
伙计，那些游戏应该是给我们玩的。
Dude, those games were supposed to be just for us.

1263
01:01:11,188 --> 01:01:12,323
他就像特洛伊游戏迷。
He's like a Troy game junkie.

1264
01:01:12,356 --> 01:01:14,391
啊!我是特洛伊游戏迷!
Ahh! I'm a total Troy game junkie!

1265
01:01:14,425 --> 01:01:16,961
我是你爸爸的超级粉丝。
And I was a big fan of your dad's.

1266
01:01:16,994 --> 01:01:21,098
嘿,你看。还记得吗?他是雅典娜9号的主角。
Hey, look. Remember? He was the lead guy on Athena 9.

1267
01:01:21,132 --> 01:01:23,234
我是主角。他说我是主角。
I was the lead guy. He said I was the lead guy.

1268
01:01:23,267 --> 01:01:24,969
然后Xodus把我解雇了。
And then Xodus laid me off.

1269
01:01:25,002 --> 01:01:26,904
把它写下来，这就是我学到的
Get it in writing, that's what I learned

1270
01:01:26,937 --> 01:01:28,339
从那里的经历。
from that experience right there.

1271
01:01:28,372 --> 01:01:30,774
没有消息，没有遣散费，什么都没有。
No word, no severance package, nothing.

1272
01:01:30,808 --> 01:01:32,810
然后我不得不回家找我妻子……噢,
Then I had to go home to my wife... oooh,

1273
01:01:32,843 --> 01:01:35,279
这个…这个女人是另一回事…

你是这么告诉他的吗?

Wh……等待,…哪一个?

等等，你有密码的副本吗?
Wait, so, you have a copy of the code?

1285
01:02:00,171 --> 01:02:03,107
对，对，就在那儿。
Yeah, yeah, it's right there.

1324
01:03:49,346 --> 01:03:51,915
差点毁了整个公司?
that almost destroyed the entire company?

1325
01:03:51,949 --> 01:03:53,250
个性……?什么电子邮件?
Personality...? What email?

1326
01:03:53,284 --> 01:03:54,918
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

1327
01:03:54,952 --> 01:03:57,354
你发的邮件感染了我们所有的电脑。
You sent an email that infected all of our computers.

1328
01:03:57,388 --> 01:04:00,424
不,我没有。我不会那么做的。
No, I didn't. I would never do that.

1329
01:04:00,458 --> 01:04:02,326
如果不是你，那是谁干的?
Well, if it wasn't you, then who did it?

1330
01:04:02,359 --> 01:04:03,193
我不管DNA怎么说，
I don't care what the DNA says,

1331
01:04:03,227 --> 01:04:05,829
我在否认亲子关系，好吗?呀。
I'm denying paternity, all right? Jeez.

1332
01:04:07,898 --> 01:04:12,202
嘿，瑞克，我不想打断你，但是……它工作。
Hey Rick, I hate to interrupt, but... it worked.

1333
01:04:12,236 --> 01:04:13,471
他们被木马病毒咬了?
They bit on the Trojan worm?

1334
01:04:13,505 --> 01:04:14,539
是的。哈!
Yeah. Ha!

1335
01:04:14,572 --> 01:04:16,307
“你是哪个《老友记》角色?”
"Which <i>Friends</i> character are you?"

1336
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:18,876
整个公司都是一群乔伊。
That whole company is a bunch of Joeys.

1337
01:04:18,909 --> 01:04:20,512
市场营销已经开始准备复古游戏了吗
Have marketing start prepping a retro release

1338
01:04:20,545 --> 01:04:22,413
所有Playfield的老游戏。
for all of Playfield's old games.

1339
01:04:22,446 --> 01:04:24,616
现在凯特得接受我的条件了。
Now Kate's gonna have to take my deal.

1340
01:04:24,649 --> 01:04:26,884
<我> Andale !</i>这意味着现在!
<i>Ándale!</i> That means now!

1341
01:04:26,917 --> 01:04:27,818
是的,先生。
Si, señor.

1342
01:04:28,886 --> 01:04:30,054
就算你没发那封邮件，
Even if you didn't send that email,

1343
01:04:30,087 --> 01:04:32,156
你还是抛弃了我们。
you still abandoned us.

1344
01:04:32,189 --> 01:04:33,957
我放弃了你?
I abandoned you?

1345
01:04:33,991 --> 01:04:35,292
你有想过吗
Did you even think for one second

1346
01:04:35,326 --> 01:04:37,361
如果游乐场关门，艾米丽会怎么样?
what could happen to Emily if Playfield closed?

1347
01:04:37,394 --> 01:04:40,431
因为我每天都这么做。
Because I did, every single day.

1348
01:04:40,465 --> 01:04:44,268
你对我太糟糕了。你在扼杀公司!
You were awful to me. And you're killing the company!

1349
01:04:44,301 --> 01:04:46,170
我没想过那些事。
I didn't think about those things.

1350
01:04:46,203 --> 01:04:48,205
我的意思是,可怕!
I mean, awful!

1351
01:04:48,238 --> 01:04:49,206
毯子里的猪?
Pig in a blanket?

1352
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:59,083
特洛伊，你是个很棒的程序员。
Troy, you're an amazing coder.

1353
01:05:02,654 --> 01:05:04,522
Jackhouse !
Jackhouse!

1354
01:05:04,556 --> 01:05:06,624
我可能因为一些私人问题
I may have let some personal issues

1355
01:05:06,658 --> 01:05:08,460
云我的判断。
cloud my judgment.

1356
01:05:10,394 --> 01:05:13,498
视频游戏。那是我一直以来想做的
Video games. That's all I've ever wanted to do

1357
01:05:13,531 --> 01:05:15,099
我的全部…
my entire...

1358
01:05:16,967 --> 01:05:18,536
我的整个生活。
my entire life.

1359
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:20,237
制作电子游戏，你知道吗?
Make video games, you know?

1360
01:05:20,270 --> 01:05:24,542
使只是…一个伟大的比赛。
Make just... one great game.

1361
01:05:24,576 --> 01:05:26,110
相同。
Same.

1362
01:05:26,143 --> 01:05:27,077
是的…
Yeah...

1363
01:05:28,379 --> 01:05:31,649
嗯…我得回去工作了。
Well... I better get back to work.

1364
01:05:31,683 --> 01:05:33,417
你是对的。你应该。
You're right. You should.

1365
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:34,719
我们运气真好。
We lucked out.

1366
01:05:34,753 --> 01:05:36,488
我们在那封邮件毁掉代码之前拿到了一份。
We secured a copy of the code before that email destroyed it.

1367
01:05:36,521 --> 01:05:38,623
但是，我们需要你。
But, we need you.

1368
01:05:38,656 --> 01:05:41,325
等等，所以你还有机会在Pixelcon发布游戏?
Wait, so you still have a chance to launch at Pixelcon?

1369
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:43,961
是的，我想是的。
Yeah, I think so.

1370
01:05:43,994 --> 01:05:46,196
如果你能回来帮忙的话。
If you'll come back and help.

1371
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:49,133
吉米，你到底在干什么?
Jimmy, what the hell are you doing?

1372
01:05:49,166 --> 01:05:52,169
爸，抱歉，你还记得我以前的老板，特洛伊·梅菲尔德吗?
Dad, sorry, um, you remember my old boss, Troy Mayfield?

1373
01:05:52,202 --> 01:05:54,506
《歌舞青春》。怎么样，伙计?
Hey, High School Musical. How's it hanging, buddy?

1374
01:05:54,539 --> 01:05:55,939
我是唯一可以这么叫他的人。
Hey, I'm the only one allowed to call him that.

1375
01:05:55,973 --> 01:05:56,775
至少他还是个孩子。
At least he's a kid.

1376
01:05:56,808 --> 01:05:58,375
他要玩电子游戏。
He's expected to play video games.

1377
01:05:58,409 --> 01:06:00,177
让视频游戏!
Make video games!

1378
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:02,079
你得回去工作了。
You need to get back to work.

1379
01:06:02,112 --> 01:06:03,947
爸爸,你是对的。
You're right, Dad.

1380
01:06:03,981 --> 01:06:04,915
我做的事。
I do.

1381
01:06:09,987 --> 01:06:13,257
听着，我很不擅长卖房地产。
Look, I am actively terrible at selling real estate.

1382
01:06:13,290 --> 01:06:14,291
视频游戏设计,
Video game design,

1383
01:06:14,324 --> 01:06:15,993
那是我这辈子最想做的事。
that's all I've ever wanted to do with my life.

1384
01:06:16,026 --> 01:06:18,295
显然，我很擅长这个。
And apparently, I'm pretty good at it.

1385
01:06:18,328 --> 01:06:21,965
你去把这些零食拿给那些买家
You go and you take these snacks to those buyers

1386
01:06:21,999 --> 01:06:23,601
否则我就不再帮你了
or I'm not gonna help you out anymore.

1387
01:06:23,635 --> 01:06:27,237
没关系,爸爸。谢谢你！
It's okay, Dad. Thank you.

1388
01:06:27,271 --> 01:06:28,272
我们走吧。
Let's go.

1389
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:41,351
那不是吉米。他没有发邮件。
It wasn't Jimmy. He didn't send the email.

1390
01:06:41,385 --> 01:06:44,254
嘿，我可以为我自己说话。
Hey, I can speak for myself.

1391
01:06:44,288 --> 01:06:47,291
这不是我。我没有发那封邮件。
It wasn't me. I didn't send the email.

1392
01:06:47,324 --> 01:06:49,092
就我而言，我从未怀疑过你。
I, for one, never doubted you.

1393
01:06:49,126 --> 01:06:51,061
我百分之百地怀疑你。
I doubted you one hundred percent.

1394
01:06:51,094 --> 01:06:52,262
电子邮件是什么?
What's an email?

1395
01:06:52,296 --> 01:06:54,466
女士们。先生们。
Ladies. Gentlemen.

1396
01:06:54,499 --> 01:06:56,366
我们失去了很多时间。
We've lost a lot of time.

1397
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,302
好吧，那就不能浪费时间了。
Well, then, there's no time to lose.

1398
01:06:58,335 --> 01:06:59,236
我们能帮上什么忙?
How can we help?

1399
01:06:59,269 --> 01:07:01,205
我们叫了援军!
We called in some reinforcements!

1400
01:07:07,377 --> 01:07:08,445
你有什么主意，特洛伊?
What's your idea, Troy?

1401
01:07:10,482 --> 01:07:12,617
你们觉得我们该怎么办?
What do you guys think we should do?

1402
01:07:12,650 --> 01:07:14,486
你问我们?
You're asking us?

1403
01:07:14,519 --> 01:07:16,788
是啊，我们都是操场游戏，对吧?
Yeah, we're all Playfield Games, right?

1404
01:07:16,821 --> 01:07:19,691
佐伊，比利，甚至迪尔先生。
Zoey, Billy, even Mr. Diehl.

1405
01:07:19,724 --> 01:07:21,726
我想听你们大声说出来。
So, I want to hear you guys speak up.

1406
01:07:21,759 --> 01:07:23,193
是时候听了。
It's just time that I listen.

1407
01:07:24,596 --> 01:07:27,097
我们没法和Xodus竞争
Well, we can't compete with Xodus

1408
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:28,766
图像和声音。
on graphics and sound.

1409
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:31,736
我们需要找到真正的玩家真正想玩的东西。
We need to find something that real gamers really want to play.

1410
01:07:31,769 --> 01:07:33,036
我在想……
I was thinking...

1411
01:07:34,572 --> 01:07:35,640
算了吧。
Forget it.

1412
01:07:35,673 --> 01:07:37,542
不，玛丽，怎么了?
No, Marie, what's up?

1413
01:07:37,575 --> 01:07:39,744
如果我们那样做呢?
What if we did that?

1414
01:07:39,777 --> 01:07:41,411
做什么?
Did what?

1415
01:07:41,445 --> 01:07:43,247
我们让球员打球……
We get the players to play...

1416
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:46,049
和…与我们的代码。
and... code with us.

1417
01:07:46,083 --> 01:07:49,052
所以，我们给了他们构建游戏世界的工具，
So, we give them the tools to build the world of the game,

1418
01:07:49,086 --> 01:07:52,757
然后，构建世界就变成了游戏。
and then, building the world becomes the game.

1419
01:07:52,790 --> 01:07:54,258
好吧。好吧,你想……
All right. Well, you want...

1420
01:07:58,763 --> 01:08:00,732
．..你想让他们这么做，对吧?
...you want to get them to do this, right?

1421
01:08:00,765 --> 01:08:01,866
但是我们要怎么做呢
But how are we going to do that

1422
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:04,134
如果这些玩家从未见过一行代码，
if these gamers have never even seen a line of code,

1423
01:08:04,167 --> 01:08:05,269
不要介意写一个?
never mind written one?

1424
01:08:05,302 --> 01:08:09,339
吉米，你给杰克豪斯的地图编辑
Uh, actually, Jimmy, your map editor for Jackhouse

1425
01:08:09,373 --> 01:08:10,708
是很强大的…
is pretty powerful...

1426
01:08:10,742 --> 01:08:13,076
对，对，对，梅菲尔德。
Right, right, right, Mayfield.

1427
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:14,278
是的。
Yeah.

1428
01:08:14,311 --> 01:08:19,383
所以，我们将编辑器包含在游戏的可执行文件中。
So, we include the editor in the executable of the game.

1429
01:08:19,416 --> 01:08:20,618
我喜欢这个!
I love this!

1430
01:08:20,652 --> 01:08:22,452
我明白了。
I get it.

1431
01:08:22,487 --> 01:08:24,288
我们使用你说的现有架构…
We use the existing architecture like you said...

1432
01:08:24,321 --> 01:08:25,355
——啊。-然后…
- Ah. - But then...

1450
01:09:36,259 --> 01:09:37,528
是的,谢谢。
Yeah, thanks.

1451
01:09:37,562 --> 01:09:38,796
是的，这些看起来都很好。
Yeah, so, this all looks good.

1452
01:09:38,830 --> 01:09:41,833
-是的。——给我。
- Yeah. - Show me.

1453
01:09:42,867 --> 01:09:43,801
是的,好的。
Yeah, okay.

1454
01:09:45,937 --> 01:09:48,506
嘿,妈妈。妈妈,你在这里。
Hey, Mom. Mom, you're here.

1455
01:09:48,539 --> 01:09:49,507
嘿。
Hey.

1456
01:09:50,541 --> 01:09:52,275
医生给我开了绿灯。
My doctor gave me the green light.

1457
01:09:52,309 --> 01:09:53,811
但你是好吗?你明白吗?
But you're good? You're okay?

1458
01:09:53,845 --> 01:09:56,514
是的。亲爱的，怎么了?
Yeah. Honey, what's going on?

1459
01:09:56,547 --> 01:09:58,750
说来话长。
It's a long story.

1460
01:09:58,783 --> 01:10:01,318
我们不打算展示杰克豪斯或尤特。
We're actually not going to demo Jackhouse or Yort.

1461
01:10:01,351 --> 01:10:02,887
我们结合了两场比赛中最好的部分，
We married the best parts of both games,

1462
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:05,355
所以现在我们叫它。
and so now we're calling it...

1463
01:10:05,389 --> 01:10:06,390
头脑风暴!
Brainstorm!

1464
01:10:08,358 --> 01:10:09,694
我知道怎么用吉米的地图了。
I figured out how to use Jimmy's maps.

1465
01:10:09,727 --> 01:10:11,496
他们与头脑风暴完美配合。
They work perfectly with Brainstorm.

1466
01:10:11,529 --> 01:10:12,964
这是唯一一个把开源编码变成游戏的游戏
It's the only game that turns open source coding

1467
01:10:12,997 --> 01:10:14,465
真正的游戏体验。
into the actual gaming experience.

1468
01:10:14,499 --> 01:10:16,266
是啊，还有全世界的人
Yeah, and everyone in the world

1469
01:10:16,299 --> 01:10:19,436
可以一起玩头脑风暴，这很酷。
can play Brainstorm together, it's pretty cool.

1470
01:10:25,943 --> 01:10:27,779
这是你爸爸的旧文件夹吗?
Is this one of your dad's old binders?

1471
01:10:29,246 --> 01:10:30,213
是的。
Yeah.

I'm very proud of you guys. But, I have to be honest.

1477

如果这个游戏没有进展，
If this game doesn't really move,

1478
01:11:02,013 --> 01:11:05,616
然后我们要卖掉公司……

1479
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:06,884
或者关闭它。
or shut it down.

1480
01:11:06,918 --> 01:11:09,654
我们知道。林登不能保守秘密。
We know. Lyndon can't keep a secret.

1481

哦……嗯…呃……
Errr... uh... errrr...

1482
01:11:11,622 --> 01:11:15,560
好吧。嗯，你认为
Okay. Well, do you think

1483
01:11:15,593 --> 01:11:19,530
这个游戏真的值得冒这个险吗?
that this game is really worth risking it all?

1484
01:11:19,564 --> 01:11:20,898
——地狱,是的。——是的!

我相信我的家人从来没有错。

Let's see what we can do together.

1706
01:25:08,158 --> 01:25:10,260
我爸爸在他的活页夹里写道

1707
01:25:10,294 --> 01:25:12,764
<i>"千万不要跳过过场动画

01:25:15,567 --> 01:25:19,169
<i>和玩多人游戏的每一个机会，你得到。" < / i >
<i>And play multi-player every chance you get."</i>

1710
01:25:21,472 --> 01:25:23,775
如果你真的想打败游戏，</i>
<i>Oh, and if you really want to beat the game,</i>

1711
01:25:23,808 --> 01:25:26,276
<i>总是让坏人知道谁是老大
<i>always show the bad guy who's boss.</i>

1712
01:25:32,349 --> 01:25:34,318
第二位。
Second place.

1713
01:25:34,351 --> 01:25:35,486
更像是第一个失败者。
More like first loser.

1714
01:25:43,928 --> 01:25:45,262
梅菲尔德吗?
Mayfield?

1715
01:25:45,295 --> 01:25:46,631
这孩子到底想要什么?
What the hell does this kid want?

1716
01:25:47,799 --> 01:25:49,901
“你是霍格沃茨的哪个学院?”
"Which Hogwarts house are you?"

1717
01:25:49,934 --> 01:25:51,536
这是个好问题。
Well, that's a good question.

1718
01:25:51,569 --> 01:25:52,537
嗯?
Huh?

1719
01:25:53,671 --> 01:25:55,673
是的。
Yeah.

1720
01:26:01,546 --> 01:26:02,547
赫奇帕奇?
Hufflepuff?

1721
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:03,681
没有办法。
There's no way.

1722
01:26:03,715 --> 01:26:04,649
哦,什么?
Uh, what?

1723
01:26:05,817 --> 01:26:06,784
发生了什么事?
What happened?

1724
01:26:06,818 --> 01:26:10,187
电脑都烧坏了。这是谁干的?
The computers are fried. Who the hell did this?

1725
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:11,589
