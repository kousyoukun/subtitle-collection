1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:06,260

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:12,260


3
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:09,090
细细的红线

4
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,750
世上为何有这么多战争?
What's this war in the heart of nature?

5
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,840
万物为何自相残杀?
Why does nature vie with itself?

6
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,630
陆地和海洋为何互相对抗?
The land contend with the sea?

7
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,770
大自然是否充满仇恨?
Is there an avenging power in nature?

8
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,150
善恶是否同时存在?
Not one power, but two?

9
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,520
我记得我母亲临终前
I remember my mother when she was dying.

10
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,940
脸色苍白 形如槁木
Looked all shrunk up and grey.

11
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,400
我问她害不害怕?
I asked her if she was afraid.

12
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,200
她只是摇摇头
She just shook her head.

13
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,410
我不敢面对她的死亡
I was afraid to touch the death seen in her.

14
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:49,160
也不觉得她蒙主荣召是一件好事
I couldn't find nothing beautiful or up lifting about her going back to God.

15
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:56,600
听说精神能永垂不朽 不过我没见过
I heard people talk about immortality, but I ain't seen it.

16
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,490
不知道我死时会怎样
I wondered how it'd be when I died.

17
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,540
当你知道那是最后一口气不知道是什么感觉
What it'd be like to know that this breath now was the last one you was ever gonna draw.

18
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,010
我希望能和她一样坦然面对
I just hope I can meet it the same way she did.

19
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,800
跟她一样...平静
With the same... calm.

20
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:33,480
当心灵得到平静精神就能永垂不朽
Cos that's where it's hidden - the immortality I hadn't seen.

21
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,230
这里的小孩不会打架
Kids around here never fight.

22
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,770
有时候会
Sometimes.

23
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,860
他们在玩耍的时候
Sometimes when you see them playing

24
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,110
总是会打架
they always fight!

25
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,580
- 他怕我吗? - 有一点
- Is she afraid of me? - Little bit.

26
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,330
- 你怕我吗? - 怕
- Are you afraid of me? - Yes.

27
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,540
- 为什么? - 因为你看起来...
- Why? - Cos you look...

28
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,960
...像是个军人
You look as an army!

29
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,130
- 我像军人? - 对
- I look army? - Yes.

30
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,970
无所谓
Well, that don't matter.

31
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,770
这不重要
It doesn't matter.

32
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,310
- 孩子累了 - 对
- Baby's tired. - Yes.

33
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,360
他游累了就会睡
If she swims, she wants, she will sleep.

34
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,260
好 来
All right, come on. Turn around.

35
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,430
快...快...快
Go, go, go, go. Go!

36
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,350
快点...快点...
Come on, go.

37
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,360
快 快 快
Go, go, go, go!

38
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,040
威特 是美军的巡逻艇
Witt, patrol boat!She's American.

39
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,020
它怎么会单独出现?
What's it doing out here all alone?

40
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,840
威特 你一点都没变
You haven't changed at all, have you, Witt?

41
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,210
什么也没学到
You haven't learned a thing.

42
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:18,550
当别人信任你你就肯为他赴汤蹈火
All a man has to do is leave it to you, you'll put your head in the noose for him.

43
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,020
你逃过几年兵?
How many times you been AWOL?

44
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,730
你当兵六年了
Been in the army, what? Six years now?

45
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,820
如果要学聪明
Ain't it time you smartened up and stopped being such a punk recruit?

46
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,990
现在该是时候了
I mean, if you're ever gonna.

47
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,160
我们不能都当聪明人
We can't all be smart.

48
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,250
没错 真可惜
No, we can't, and that's a shame.

49
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,420
看看你
Look at you.

50
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,380
你在我的连队不能乖乖服役
Truth is, you can't take straight duty in my company.

51
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,350
你在这世上不能成为 一个好的军人
You'll never be a real soldier, not in God's world.

52
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,730
这是C连 我是副连长
This is C Company, of which I'm First Sergeant. I run this outfit.

53
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,650
史塔洛上尉是连长 这里是我话事 任何人都不可以违抗
Captain Staros, he's the CO, but I'm the guy who runs it. Nobody's gonna foul that up.

54
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,570
你只是一张吃饭的嘴
You're just another mouth for me to feed.

55
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,950
你本来要接受军事审判
Normally, you'd be court-martialled.

56
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,540
算你好运
But I worked a deal for ya.

57
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,710
我给你另作安排
Gotta consider yourself lucky.

58
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:32,000
我派你到纪律部队
I'm sending you to a disciplinary outfit.

59
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:36,510
当担架兵 照顾伤兵
You'll be a stretcher-bearer. You'll be taking care of the wounded.

60
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,800
我能接受任何处罚
I can take anything you dish out.

61
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,220
我一个人就比你好两倍
I'm twice the man you are.

62
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,780
在这个世界里
In this world...

63
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,530
一个人根本微不足道
a man himself is nothing.

64
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,250
只有这一个世界
And there ain't no world but this one.

65
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,040
你错了 副连长
You're wrong there, Top.

66
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,920
我见过另一个世界
I seen another world.

67
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,390
有时候我觉得这只是我的想像
Sometimes I think it was just... my imagination.

68
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,900
好
Well,

69
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,690
我和你的看法不同
then you've seen things I never will.

70
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:50,870
这个世界在自我毁灭
We're living in a world that's blowing itself to hell as fast as everybody can arrange it.

71
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:56,800
你只以只眼开只眼闭
In a situation like that all a man can do is shut his eyes and let nothing touch him.

72
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,960
为自己着想
Look out for himself.

73
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,940
我可能是你最好的朋友
I might be the best friend you ever had.

74
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,230
你自己都不知道
You don't even know it.

75
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:52,100
他憎死你了
He hates you worse than poison.

76
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,360
我不觉得他憎我 因为我不憎他
I never felt he hated me, cos I don't hate him.

77
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,400
我爱C队的兄弟
I love Charlie Company.

78
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,450
他们是我的家人
They're my people.

79
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,230
这个岛叫"顽石"
They call it "The Rock".

80
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,560
原本无人占领 后来让日军盖了机场
Nobody wants this island. Japs just put an airfield there.

81
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,520
主要战区在这里
Fighting's confined to this area.

82
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:28,200
这是攻击澳洲的途径亦是进攻美国的海道
This is their road to Australia, and this is their way of controlling the sea lanes to America.

83
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:33,490
若要阻止日军攻占南太平洋 就得在这里开战
If we're gonna stop the Japs' advance into the South Pacific, we've gotta do it right there.

84
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,080
海军陆战队已经试过 现在轮到我们
The Marines have done their job. Now it's our turn.

85
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,630
我们将奋不顾身
Worked my ass off.

86
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,260
尽量迎合将军
Brown-nosed the generals.

87
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,590
降低身份
Degraded myself

88
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,640
为他们 为我家人
for them and my family.

89
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,020
和我的家
For my home.

90
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,980
- 我很敬佩你 上校 - 谢谢你 长官
- I admire you, Colonel. I do. - Thank you, sir.

91
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,030
你这年纪的军官早已退休了
Most men your age would have retired by now.

92
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:07,190
你是好军人
It's OK.

93
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,910
部队需要你这种成熟的长官
We need general officers with maturity and character like you.

94
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,370
我们有好的中士和中校
We've got good sergeants and good lieutenant colonels.

95
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,830
他们一当了上校 就想做将军
But once a man gets those eagles, he can't wait to get that star.

96
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:21,000
于是成为政客
He becomes a politician, right?

97
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,170
只会拍上司的马屁
Goes along to get along.

98
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,880
很难坚持原则
So goddamn hard to stay upright.

99
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:32,010
- 你说得对 长官 - 上将会注意我的表现
- You said it there, sir. - With the Admiral watching, which he will be.

100
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,010
- 一定有人盯着你 - 嗯
- There's always someone watching. - Yeah.

101
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,060
像只猎鹰
Like a hawk.

102
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,310
总是有人想抢你的功劳
Always someone ready to jump in, if you're not.

103
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,740
- 你有儿子吗 上校? - 有的 长官
- D'you have a son, Colonel? - Yes, sir.

104
00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:00,250
很好 不能让子孙打这场烂仗
Good. We don't want our sons or grandsons fighting this war 30 years from now, do we?

105
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,880
- 没错 是不能 - 那就全力攻敌
- No, sir, we sure don't. - Then you crush 'em without mercy.

106
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,000
把敌人赶尽杀绝 抢下机场
You dig them out of the hills and protect that airfield.

107
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,960
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

108
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:15,220
你有没有想过日军为何在这儿盖机场?
You wonder why... Why did the Japs put an airfield there of all places?

109
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,390
我们对大局不太清楚
I guess we don't know the bigger picture, if there is such a thing.

110
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:23,560
- 你认为呢? - 我从不想这种问题
- What do you think? - Well, sir, I never ask myself that question.

111
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,310
你很谦虚
You're a humble man.

112
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,650
没人要这座岛...除了你
Nobody wants that island... but you.

113
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,240
你有多大的决心?
How much do you want it?

114
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,740
我会全力以赴
As much as I have to, sir.

115
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,660
家人为我做的牺牲
All they sacrificed for me

116
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,460
就像覆水难收
poured out like water on the ground.

117
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,180
我本来能好好爱他们
All I might have given for love's sake.

118
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,780
太迟了
Too late.

119
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,700
我的心已死
Died...

120
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,210
像树木一样慢慢凋零
slow as a tree.

121
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,540
你感觉得到吗?
D'you feel it?

122
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,340
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

123
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,550
谢谢你 长官
Thank you, sir.

124
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,540
权力越大 恐惧越深
The closer you are to Caesar, the greater the fear.

125
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,850
我就是感到害怕
I just can't help how damn scared I am, sarge, all right?

126
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,560
无法控制
I can't help it. I got...

127
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,020
小时候我继父常用砖块打我
My stepdaddy took a block and beat me when I was real little

128
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,900
我好怕 老是躲起来
and I was scared and I used to run, I used to hide.

129
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,650
时常睡在鸡窝
Hell, I slept in the chicken coop a whole lot of nights.

130
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:39,910
我以为我不会再害怕
And I never thought it'd get no worse than that.

131
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,040
但是现在我分秒都在害怕
But I'm living by the... by the minute here. I'm counting the seconds.

132
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,580
马上就要登陆一定会遭到空袭
Hell, we're gonna be landing soon and there's gonna be air raids.

133
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:53,130
我们会阵亡在滩头
We're probably gonna die before we get off the beach.

134
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:57,220
这艘船就像漂流的坟墓
This place is... It's like a big floating graveyard.

135
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,510
- 你叫什么 小子? - 我退伍后想买一辆车
- What's your name, kid? - I wanna own an automobile when I get out.

136
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,770
- 你叫什么? - 爱德华崔恩
- What's your name? - Edward, Edward B Train.

137
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:06,930
崔恩?
Train?

138
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:12,440
只有上帝和死亡是永恒的
The only things that are permanent is, is dying and the Lord. That's it.

139
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:18,440
我只担心这些 这场战争不是你我的终点
That's all you gotta worry about. This war ain't... gonna be the end of me or you neither.

140
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,860
- 会遇到空袭吗? - 我怎么知道?
- Think we'll catch an air raid? - How in the hell should I know?

141
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:26,700
别的大兵说上次进攻就没有
All's I know are them crew guys said they didn't catch no air raid the last time.

142
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:30,370
上上一次他们差点被炸死
On the other hand, time before last they nearly got blew up.

143
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,330
你要我怎么说
What d'you want me to tell you?

144
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,460
多谢了 你什么也没说
You're a big help, Tills. Nothing. Tell me nothing.

145
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,010
不过我要告诉你
Tell you something.

146
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:41,680
我们在船上就像是死鸭子
We're sitting out here on this ocean like a couple of fuckin' ducks in these boats.

147
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,720
我早就知道
I already know that.

148
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,560
好好想一想 提奥
Well, brood on it, Tills.

149
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,930
好好地想
Brood on it.

150
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,440
- 不看好戏吗? - 没兴趣
- Ain't you watching the fun? - I ain't interested.

151
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,980
- 太迫了 - 就算不迫我也不想看
- Yeah, I guess it is pretty crowded. - Wouldn't be interested, even if it wasn't.

152
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,860
我要去拿那把手枪
Well, I'm on my way to get me that pistol.

153
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,610
是吗? 开心点
Yeah? Well, have fun.

154
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,910
是啊 开心点
Yeah, have fun.

155
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:07,830
有手枪才能对付日本武士刀
You'll wish you had one once we get ashore and run into some of them samurai sabres.

156
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:11,540
快开门 给我开门...
Open this door! Open this goddamn door!

157
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,500
快开门
Open the door!

158
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:39,110
我入伍时没想到会有这下场
I never bargained for nothing like this when I signed up for this man's army before the war.

159
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:43,990
我怎么知道会打仗? 你倒是说说
How was I supposed to know there was gonna be a fuckin' war, huh? Answer me that.

160
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,950
我只知道C连最衰了
All I know is Charlie Company's always getting screwed. Always.

161
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,790
我也知道是谁的错
And I can tell you whose fault it is, too.

162
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,830
就是我们的连长
It's that captain of ours.

163
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,710
他害大家被派上这艘鬼船
First he gets us stuck off on this boat where we don't know a fucking soul.

164
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:06,260
而且是第四批登陆部队
Then he gets us stuck way down in fourth place on the list to get off this son of a bitch.

165
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,030
连长 你好
Hello, Captain.

166
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:09,740
档案说你在战前是军官
I read in your 201 file that you were an officer before the war.

167
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,490
怎么会变成二等兵?
How'd you end up a private?

168
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,660
因为我太太
Cos of my wife.

169
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,620
我本来在工兵部队
I was in the corps of engineers.

170
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,880
我和她从来没分开过
We'd never been separated before,

171
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,050
连一晚都没有
not even for a night.

172
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,890
我忍受了四个月最后终于放弃
I took it for four months and then I quit.

173
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,890
辞职不干
Just resigned.

174
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,600
我被送回美国
They sent me back to the States.

175
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,770
永远不能当军官
They told me I'd never get another commission.

176
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:45,530
他们说要徵召我入伍让我当步兵
They said they'd see to it I got drafted and that I for damn sure'd be in the infantry.

177
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,240
那些浑蛋
Sons of bitches.

178
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,950
我不怪他们
No, I don't blame them.

179
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,450
她在哪里?
Well, where is she now?

180
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,410
在家里
She's home.

181
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,220
我并不怕死
Why should i be afraid to die?

182
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,310
因为我已属于你
I belong to you.

183
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,400
快...快...快...
Move! Move! Move!

184
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,570
快 快
Move! Move!

185
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,950
快点...
Move! Move!

186
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,280
快 快
Moving out!

187
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:39,540
如果我先走 我会等你的
If i go first, I'll wait for you there.

188
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,290
就在死亡的另一边
On the otherside of the dark waters.

189
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,680
贝尔 戴上头盔
Put your helmet on.

190
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,890
你与我同在
Be with me now.

191
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,440
- 压力很大 对吧? - 是的 长官
- Feeling the pressure, Captain? - Yes, sir.

192
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,110
我喜欢你 上尉
I like you, Captain.

193
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,700
我要你知道我很支持你
And I just want you to know, well, we're in this thing together. All right?

194
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:21,870
你先逼近敌区 我会赶上来
Keep pressing inland till you reach the line. I'll catch up with you there.

195
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,830
- 是的 长官 - 由你全权指挥
- Yes, sir. - It's all yours, Captain.

196
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,380
让开 让开
Gangway! Gangway there!

197
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,920
我要过去
Coming through!

198
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,920
班长马上报到
Squad leaders! Both teams!

199
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:33,340
在这里
This way, son. This way, right here.

200
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,470
准备上登陆船
Stand by to go over the side!

201
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,280
我们在天上的父
Our Father, who art in heaven...

202
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:56,160
免我们的债如同我们免人的债
And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.

203
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,870
国度权柄荣耀全是您的 阿们
For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory.

204
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,640
你们很幸运
Your outfit's lucky.

205
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,810
运输船刚被日军发现
Transports must've been spotted.

206
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,810
幸好你们下来了
You're getting outta here just ahead of time.

207
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,700
深呼吸 你得深呼吸
Take a breath, mister. You gotta breathe!

208
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,520
- 这是C连吗? - 是的
- You Charlie Company? - Yeah.

209
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,690
我们深入内陆一英里 什么也没有
We went in a mile. Nothing there.

210
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:09,320
一个礼拜都没动静
Some oil drums. There'd be nothing there for...

211
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,780
- 一个礼拜 - 一个礼拜 长官
- A week. - A week, sir.

212
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,320
无人伤亡 日军大概都跑了
No casualties. Japs must've hauled ass.

213
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,450
我们受迫击炮攻击 无人伤亡
Two mortars hit the beach, but most guys came in standing up.

214
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,410
这地方很不可思议
Darnedest thing I ever did see.

215
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,460
还有鱼住在树上
They got fish that live in trees.

216
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:31,630
指挥部好像没搞清楚状况
If they didn't know this beach was deserted, what else don't they know?

217
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,640
您化身为宇宙万物
Who are you to live in all these many forms?

218
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,140
万物皆难逃一死
Your death that captures all.

219
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,480
您也是生命的泉源
You, too, are the source of all that's gonna be born.

220
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,710
您充满荣耀
Your glory.

221
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,090
慈悲
Mercy.

222
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,720
宁静
Peace.

223
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,770
真理
Truth.

224
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,690
您能安抚人心
You give calm a spirit,

225
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,820
给人们谅解
understanding,

226
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,700
和勇气
courage.

227
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,460
使人得到满足
The contented heart.

228
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,850
医务兵 这里
Get a medic here!

229
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:47,650
也许每个人都有共同的灵魂 和相同的命运
Maybe all men got one big soul who everybody's a part of.

230
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,860
每张脸孔都是同一个人
All faces of the same man.

231
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,200
一个大我
One big self.

232
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,530
每个人都想获得救赎
Everyone looking for salvation by himself.

233
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:44,870
像炭火般燃烧生命
Each like a coal drawn from the fire.

234
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:19,740
我们要攻上那座山头
We're going straight up that hill there.

235
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:27,500
- 办不到 上校 - 我们无法包抄敌军
- We can't do that, Colonel. - Well, there's no way to outflank it.

236
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,500
左边的悬崖底下是河流
On the left is a cliff that falls down into the river.

237
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:34,380
日军守住丛林 我们得正面突袭
The Japanese hold the jungle. It has to be taken frontally.

238
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:39,510
食水怎么办? 山上没清水
What about water, sir? It's not getting up here.

239
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,010
我的兄弟都因为脱水昏倒
My men are... passing out, sir.

240
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:53,690
他们能发牢骚就能打仗
Only time you worry about a soldier is when he stops bitching.

241
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:11,210
并肩前进 第三排留守
We're all gonna attack abreast. Third Platoon in reserve.

242
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:14,670
我们得越过三个山丘
We've gotta cross those three folds of ground. You see?

243
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,550
然后再攻下山头
Once we get beyond that, we gotta attack that hill.

244
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:34,400
上校说不能采取包抄攻势 我们得正面突袭
Colonel says there's no way to outflank it, so we gotta take it head-on by frontal assault.

245
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,610
- 伟特 - 是
- Whyte? - Yeah?

246
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,700
- 看到山坡前面吗? - 看到了
- See the grassy ridges at the foot of that hill? - Yeah.

247
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:45,790
等你攻上山坡 找到敌军据点然后消灭他们
When you get to the end of that field, eliminate all strong points on those ridges.

248
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,090
那儿一定有敌军守住
I'm sure the Japs got something there to protect the approaches.

249
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,280
主啊 您在吗?
Are you here?

250
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,670
别让我背叛您
Let me not betray you.

251
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,470
别让我背叛我的兄弟
Let me not betray my men.

252
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,440
您让我充满信心 和希望
In you I place my trust.

253
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,540
(希腊语)

254
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:39,540
玫瑰般的黎明
Rosy-fingered dawn.

255
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,460
你是希腊人
You're Greek, aren't you, Captain?

256
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,630
读过荷马的史诗吗?
D'you ever read Homer?

257
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:50,220
我在西点军校读过希腊原文
We read Homer at the Point.In Greek.

258
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,800
有多少炮兵支援火力?
What kind of artillery support do we have, sir? Over.

259
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:58,470
- 两组105榴弹炮 - 一点都没有用
- Two batteries of 105s. - They won't make a dent. Over.

260
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,940
不过能提高士气 日军会被炸得很难看
No, but it bucks the men up. It'll look like the Japs are catching hell.

261
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,660
兄弟们
OK, you guys.

262
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,410
准备上吧
This is it.

263
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,000
每组十人攻上山头
We're going down in groups often.

264
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:08,880
快速前进才不会成为目标
There's no point in going by rushes. Only make a better target stopped, so...

265
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,300
一路跑上去
run all the way.

266
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,720
我们被选上 别无选择 非去不可
We ain't got no choice. We're picked, so we gotta go.

267
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:20,140
我亲自带领先锋队
I'm gonna take the first bunch myself.

268
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,560
我要戴尔跟着我 戴尔?
I want Charlie Dale with me. Dale?

269
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,350
叫兄弟在山坡集合
You go organise them guys that's up there.

270
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:33,360
五分钟后出发
Moving out in five minutes.

271
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,860
走吧
Let's go.

272
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,950
施高?
Sico?

273
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:45,710
- 你怎么了? - 我的肚子好痛
- What's wrong with you? - I'm sick to my stomach.

274
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:49,130
起来 小心我踢扁你
Sico, you get up now, or I'll kick you so hard you're gonna be sick.

275
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,000
我站不起来
I can't. I would if I could.

276
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:53,420
我生病了
I'm sick.

277
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:55,380
我病了
I'm sick.

278
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:57,550
你没有病 起来
You ain't sick. Get up!

279
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:05,270
- 施高 怎么了? - 不晓得
- What's the matter, Sico? - I don't know, Sergeant.

280
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:08,520
肚子好痛 好像是胃痉孪
It's my stomach. I'm in pain, I got cramps.

281
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,860
我病了 坐不起来
I can't even sit up straight. I'm sick.

282
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,740
- 给我起来! - 别逼他了
- Come on, get up! - Leave him.

283
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:21,080
谁要替我拿步枪? 我带你找医官
I need a volunteer to carry the BAR! Drop your gear. I'm taking you to the medics.

284
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,240
谢谢你 副连长
Thank you, Sergeant.

285
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,620
别跟我争
Don't argue with me.

286
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:29,790
祝好运 杰克
Good luck, Keck.

287
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,770
也许他们撤退了
Maybe they pulled out.

288
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,150
快趴下!
Hit dirt!

289
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,480
趴下来!
Hit dirt!

290
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:21,320
冷静点...冷静点...
Calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down.

291
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,160
担架兵
Stretcher-bearers!

292
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:45,510
这儿
Come on!

293
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,680
担架兵 在这儿
Stretcher-bearers, this way!

294
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:51,980
- 去救那兄弟 - 已经有八 九名伤兵...
- Go get that man. - We already got eight or nine down there...

295
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:56,110
- 别跟我争 我要救他 - 管不了他们了
- Don't argue with me! Get that man! - He's not the one we should think about...

296
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:59,490
该死 全都要救 我是指挥官
Goddamn it, all of you! Am I in command here or am I not?!

297
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:03,660
- 难道你是连长吗? - 我只是说别人伤得更重
- Am I the captain or a goddamn private? - Others are hit bad. That's all I meant.

298
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,750
- 二兵 听我的命令 - 是 长官!
- I gave you an order, private! - Yes, sir!

299
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,170
你好 副连长
Hello, First Sergeant.

300
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,340
我们要救谁?
Who we going after over here?

301
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:19,220
应该是积克
We think it's Jacques.

302
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,430
积克老兄
Ol' Jockey.

303
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:24,220
真是倒霉
Well, shit. That's, that's, that's too bad.

304
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,180
长官?
Sir?

305
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:32,140
把积克抬回去我能回来吗?
Sir? Sir, can I come back to the company after we get Jockey back to the battalion?

306
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:37,070
- 好 你要得到许可 - 当然 我的步枪
- OK, but you gotta get permission. - Sure. And my rifle.

307
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:42,530
力奇 你还活着
Nicky! You're still alive!

308
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:45,320
继续前进! 继续前进!
Keep moving! Keep moving!

309
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:52,420
太好了 史塔奥 好久没见到这么猛烈的攻击
Magnificent, Staros, magnificent. The finest thing these old eyes have seen in a long time!

310
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:57,000
你指挥得很好 我会请营长给你功勋
Beautifully conceived and executed! You'll be mentioned in battalion orders.

311
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:59,630
伟特排长的表现也很棒
Young Whyte led beautifully.

312
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:01,800
是 长官
Yes, sir. Over.

313
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,760
派第二排增援也很聪明
But sending in your second too was brilliant.

314
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:10,350
就快攻上去了 伤亡不惨重 布兰也不错
They may have carried the ridge. I don't think they were hurt too bad. Blane led well, too.

315
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:13,230
他们发现多少据点?
Now, how many emplacements did they locate?

316
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:15,400
消灭了多少?
Did they knock any out?

317
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:19,530
中午就应该能攻上山头
We ought to have those ridges cleaned out by noon! Over.

318
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:23,950
史塔奥 你在吗?
Hello! Hello! Staros, are you there?

319
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:26,280
我在 长官
Here, sir. Over.

320
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:31,250
他们发现多少据点? 消灭了多少?
I said, how many emplacements did they locate? Did they knock any out? Over.

321
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:33,710
孩子们
Children.

322
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:36,630
我不知道
I don't know, sir.

323
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:41,210
什么意思? 你怎么会不知道?
What the hell do you mean, you don't know? How can you not know? Over.

324
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:45,630
我在第一座山丘后面
I'm right here behind the first swell, sir. I'm right here behind the swell.

325
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,050
要我站起来招手吗?
You want me to stand up and wave? Over.

326
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:51,350
我看到了 你得想办法
No, I can see where you are. I want you to do something.

327
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:54,640
快上去看看情况如何
I want you to get up there and see what the situation is.

328
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:56,980
今晚我就要你攻下山头
I want Hill 210 in my hands tonight.

329
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:00,400
上将一早就要来查看
Now, goddamn it, the Admiral got up at dawn for this!

330
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,940
提起精神来 史塔奥
Come to life up there, Staros. Out!

331
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,390
上来
Move up!

332
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,200
嘿 杰克!
Hey, Keck!

333
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:54,290
干嘛?
Yeah?

334
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:57,540
- 我们得撤退 - 我知道
- We gotta get out of here. - I know it.

335
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,420
布兰死了
Blane's dead.

336
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,590
你得指挥
You're in charge.

337
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:08,680
美国佬 我们看到你们
We know you there, Yank!

338
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:11,550
东条英机去死
Tojo eats shit!

339
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,890
罗斯福去死
No! Roosevelt eats shit!

340
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,550
我打到他了 我打到他了
I got him! I got him!

341
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:12,570
我杀死一个人
I killed a man.

342
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,740
嘿 昆恩!
Hey, Queen!

343
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:17,330
昆恩 你在吗?
Queen, you there?

344
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:21,460
杀人比强奸更严重
Worst thing you can do. Worse than rape.

345
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:24,500
看到日本鬼子离开左边吗?
Queen! You see them Japs leaving that left ridge?

346
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:28,420
- 没有人能把我怎样 - 我什么也没看到
- I killed a man. Nobody can touch me for it. - I ain't seen nothing.

347
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:31,550
抬起头来看看
Well, get your fuckin' head up and look around!

348
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:35,100
我是说真的!
I'm serious!

349
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:39,100
有七个日兵离开左边
I counted seven Japs leaving that left-hand grassy ridge!

350
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,690
我打中一个
I got me one of 'em.

351
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:43,020
又怎样?
So?

352
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,360
他们可能会撤退
I think maybe they're pulling out.

353
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:51,070
也许该去告诉连长
Maybe somebody ought to go tell the captain.

354
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:52,700
你想去吗?
You wanna be the one to do it?

355
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:01,160
我命令你别乱动
You just stay put! I'm ordering you!

356
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:25,730
趴低
Down!

357
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:36,490
趴低点
Stay low.

358
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:05,140
冲! 冲!
Go! Go!

359
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:07,440
冲! 冲!
Go! Go!

360
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:50,360
现在怎么办?
What do we do now?

361
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,610
在这儿等 也许会有人来支援
We wait right here. Maybe they'll send us up some reinforcements.

362
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:56,150
做什么?
To do what?

363
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,280
攻下敌军的据点呀
To capture some of these fucking positions around here!

364
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:04,830
- 你要继续进攻? - 不知道 不能直接进攻山头
- You mean you really wanna go on with this? - Hell, no. No, not no uphill charge.

365
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:08,580
不过如果有支援
If they send us reinforcements, maybe we could scout around

366
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:10,750
就能试着除掉机关枪
and locate these machine guns.

367
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:14,840
- 总比冒死退回去好 - 有人来了
- Anyway, it's better than going back down. - Something's coming!

368
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,840
他们来了!
They're coming!

369
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:23,600
他们在干什么?
What are they doin'?

370
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,770
他们为什么不全力进攻?
If they want to throw us out, why didn't they come in force?

371
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:29,060
也许他们落了单
Maybe they was acting on their own.

372
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,070
也许他们想上西天
Maybe they wanted to get into nirvana.

373
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:36,440
敌人来了
They're coming.

374
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,660
怎么回事?
Keck!

375
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:49,160
天啊
Jesus!

376
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:51,330
老天!
Oh, Jesus!

377
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,590
我炸到屁股!
I blew my butt off!

378
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:58,090
- 没事 没事 - 我把屁股炸掉了
- It's all right. It's all right. - I blew my butt off!

379
00:56:58,170 --> 00:56:59,630
趴下来
Lay down!

380
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,470
我怎么会这么衰?
What a fucking recruit trick to pull!

381
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:05,560
- 我只拔到保险制 - 写信给我老婆
- Take it easy. Take it easy. - I grabbed it by the pin!

382
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:10,690
告诉她我死得很光荣
You write my old lady. You tell her... I want her to know I died like a man.

383
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:13,110
你不会死的 没人给她写 得你自己来
Nobody's gonna have to write her. You'll make it.

384
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:15,070
- 别骗我 - 下来
- Don't bullshit me! - Stay down!

385
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:17,230
嘿 嘿
Hey, hey.

386
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,110
我全身是泥
Have I got mud on my face?

387
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,280
帮我擦掉
Wipe it off. Get it off.

388
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:25,870
不
No!

389
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:28,040
我会写信给她
I'll write her. I promise.

390
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:35,260
我的水壶还有水 拿去吧
Take my canteen. There's still some water in there.

391
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:42,140
也许这样最好
It's for the best.

392
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:45,310
我的下面被炸烂
I'm all messed up down there.

393
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,570
不能搞了
I can't fuck no more.

394
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:54,320
我在哪儿?
Whoa... Where am I?

395
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:57,450
我在哪儿?
Where am I?

396
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:02,580
你不会有事
You're gonna be all right.

397
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:06,790
就算你死了 你没有对不起兄弟
Even if you die, you didn't let your brother down.

398
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,590
要是你不扑上去 我们全都会死
If you hadn't thrown yourself against that embankment, we'd all have been killed.

399
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:13,760
我好冷
I'm cold.

400
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:18,350
我好冷
I'm cold.

401
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,680
我快冻死了
I'm... freezing.

402
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:18,860
你要写信给他老婆?
You gonna write his wife?

403
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:22,150
才不要
Fuck, no.

404
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:24,650
我又不认识她
I don't know his old lady.

405
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:29,780
那是连长的事 别傻了 我不会写信
That's the company commander's job. You outta your mind? I ain't no good at writing.

406
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:31,950
你答应过他
You told him you would.

407
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:35,830
他快死了 我得那么说
I'll say anything to 'em when they're like that.

408
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:38,540
有人得写信给她
Somebody ought to do it.

409
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:41,500
你写给她吧
Well, then, you write her. Yeah, you write her.

410
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,060
怎么回事?
What's wrong, Jim?

411
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:18,140
他没救了 谁也救不了他
There's nothing anybody can do for him. He'll die before they get him to a surgeon.

412
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:23,230
- 你不必去了 - 我可以替他注射吗啡
- Then I can't ask you to go out there. - Maybe I could get some morphine into him.

413
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:26,570
- 能让他安静吗? - 不能 我可以打两针
- Would it keep him quiet? - Not for long, but I can give him two.

414
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:30,070
留三 四针给他自己打
And I could maybe leave him three or four for himself.

415
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,450
你能一次打完吗?
Couldn't you give 'em to him all at once?

416
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:55,010
你们都会死
That's what you are.

417
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,850
我们全都会没命
That's all there is for us. That's us, that's us.

418
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:03,690
我的十二名弟兄都死了
I lost all twelve. I lost all twelve.

419
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:06,860
全都挂了
All twelve of 'em.

420
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:08,400
太疯狂了
It's insanity up there.

421
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,570
我叫他们勇往直前
I told 'em what to do, I showed 'em where to go and I gave 'em a push.

422
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:17,990
- 救命 - 我认得你...副连长
- Somebody help! - I know you. I know you, Sergeant.

423
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:22,790
这里谁指挥? 别放走他
It's insane. I don't know who's in charge here, but don't let him go! Don't let him go!

424
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:24,920
我要走 我要走
I'm outta here. I'm outta here.

425
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,130
两只脚 快走 走啊
I'm outta here. All right, move feet. Move, move, move, move. Move, move!

426
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:31,970
我要走了 我要走了...
I'm moving. I'm moving. I'm moving now.

427
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:36,720
别碰我 别看我 别碰我 别看我 我走了
Don't touch. Don't touch. Don't look at me. Don't touch. OK, I'm outta here.

428
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,810
没事了 没事了
All right. All right.

429
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:41,850
没事了 没事了
All right. All right.

430
01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:02,000
救救我
Somebody help me!

431
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,330
救救我!
Help me!

432
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:08,210
还好吧 小子? 我来救你了 提拉
You gotta be quiet. I came to help you, Tella.

433
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:10,710
- 安静点 - 去你的
- OK. Calm down. - Fuck you!

434
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,880
我快死了 我快死了
I'm dying! I'm dying, sarge!

435
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:16,390
那就安静地等死
OK. Well, goddamn it, do it with less noise!

436
01:03:17,390 --> 01:03:20,220
- 你能救我吗? - 我会带你回去
- How you gonna get me out? - I'm gonna take you back.

437
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,310
- 来 - 不!
- Come on. - No!

438
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:27,980
放我下来 放我下来
Put me down! Put me down!

439
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:36,320
别管我 你别管我
Leave me alone... Leave me alone.

440
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:38,780
你别管我
Please, leave me alone.

441
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:49,290
给我多一点 给我多一点
Give me more. Give me more.

442
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,170
再给我多一点...
Give me more. Give me more.

443
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:54,420
再给我多一点...
Give me more. Give me more.

444
01:03:57,550 --> 01:03:58,800
来吧
Here, Tella.

445
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:10,190
再见...再见...
Goodbye... goodbye.

446
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,150
再见了 小子
Bye, kid.

447
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:18,240
再见 副连长
Goodbye, sarge. Goodbye.

448
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:38,470
幸好部队不必只靠一个大兵
Fortunately, Jim, the fate of the company doesn't depend on one man.

449
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:46,430
我用望远镜看到经过
Sergeant, I saw the whole thing through the glasses.

450
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:50,770
我会请营长表扬你
I'm gonna mention you in orders tomorrow and recommend you for the Silver Star.

451
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:53,480
- 我要替你争取银星勋章 - 长官
- It's the most courageous thing... - Captain,

452
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:57,780
你再说下去我就把你揍扁
you say one more word to thank me, I'll knock you right in the teeth.

453
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:01,570
你去争取勋章 我马上辞职
You mention me in your fuckin' orders, and I'll resign so fast

454
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:05,700
让你一个人指挥这个烂部队
and leave you here to run this busted-up outfit by yourself.

455
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:09,040
懂不懂?
You understand?

456
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:13,500
权力! 打仗全是为了权力
Property! Whole fuckin' thing's about property.

457
01:05:28,430 --> 01:05:32,730
你在搞什么鬼? 马上派人支援他们
What's the matter with you, Staros? Those men should be reinforced immediately!

458
01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:35,650
他们在干嘛?
What are they doing? I can see 'em through my glasses.

459
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:37,820
躲在那里做什么?
They're lying behind that ledge!

460
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:41,450
他们应该去消灭机关枪
They should be up and out, cleaning out those machine guns! Over!

461
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:44,450
我想你不明白 长官
I don't think you understand what's going on, sir.

462
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:47,410
我们的伤亡惨重
We've had... heavy casualties.

463
01:05:47,490 --> 01:05:52,370
有一个人的肠子被打出来 死得很惨
We had a man... His gut got shot out on the slopes, sir. Created quite an upset.

464
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:55,630
好吧 到底有没有支援?
Fine, fine. Now, what about those reinforcements? Over.

465
01:05:55,710 --> 01:06:01,550
第一排有两个班可以支援
I have two squads to First Platoon I can send up, sir. Over.

466
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:04,050
什么 两个班?!
What the hell do you mean, two squads?!

467
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:07,600
该死 我叫你支援就照办
Goddamn you, Staros! When I say reinforcements,

468
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:12,440
马上派全体兄弟攻上去
goddamn it, I mean it! You commit everybody you have there and do it now!

469
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:16,520
第一排也得去 我看到他们躺着不动
Your First Platoon, too. I see 'em lying on their fat asses doing nothing.

470
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:21,650
派人上去 命令他们进攻 命令他们侧攻
Get a man to 'em right now with orders to attack, and move 'em by the flank to the ridge.

471
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:24,530
然后叫第二排攻上山头
Then get that Second Platoon over to the hill!

472
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:27,870
叫他们直接攻上去
Have 'em press the centre. Go straight up that goddamn hill!

473
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:29,620
马上进攻
Attack them right now!

474
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:33,500
天啊 要我教吗?
Jesus, Staros! Do i have to give you a lesson on infantry tactics

475
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:36,210
你的兄弟快被射死了
while your men are getting their asses shot off?.

476
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:40,050
上校 你不明白这里的情况
Colonel, I don't think you fully understand what is going on here.

477
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:43,340
光凭这一队不能攻下山头
My company alone cannot take that position, sir.

478
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:46,930
敌军防守严密 火力太强
The Japs are too well dug in. They've got too much fire power.

479
01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:49,100
上面有座碉堡
Colonel, there's a bunker up there.

480
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:52,560
我们看不到 它把我的兄弟打得很惨
We can't see it, and it's... it's chewing my men to pieces, sir.

481
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:59,320
请你准许我先派人
I request permission for patrol reconnaissance around

482
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:03,030
进入右边的森林搜查
to the right of Hill 210. I believe the entire position, sir,

483
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:05,740
从右边包抄应该能攻下山头
can be outflanked with a manoeuvre there in force.

484
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:08,120
- 不行 该死 - 挽救生命
- No! Goddamn it, no! - Might save lives!

485
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,080
不能包抄
There'll be no flanking move.

486
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,000
听我说 你不能带兄弟
Listen, Staros. You're not gonna take your men

487
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:16,540
躲到丛林当缩头乌龟
around into the jungle to avoid a goddamn fight!

488
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:22,170
我要你带领兄弟全力进攻
Do you hear me, Staros? I want you to attack right now with every man at your disposal!

489
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:25,130
史塔奥 快进攻 这是命令
Now, attack, Staros! That's a direct order!

490
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:37,480
我必须违背你的命令
Sir, I must tell you that I refuse to obey your order.

491
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:55,910
- 在那里 能看见吗? - 看不见
- There it is, right there. See it? - I don't see it.

492
01:07:56,670 --> 01:07:59,460
你没有错 他下了命令
This is not your fault, Jim. He's ordering you to.

493
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:08,470
我请你让我派人到丛林搜查
I again request permission for patrol reconnaissance around to the right in force.

494
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:13,430
现在时间是...13时21分25秒
The time, sir,... is 1321 hours, 25 seconds.

495
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:18,520
两名证人听到我的话 请你也找证人
I have two witnesses here. I request that you do the same with witnesses there. Over.

496
01:08:23,690 --> 01:08:27,240
别给我来律师那一套
Staros, don't pull this guardhouse-lawyer bullshit with me!

497
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:31,450
你是律师 这里却不是法庭
Now, I know you're a goddamn lawyer! This is not a court of law.

498
01:08:31,530 --> 01:08:33,790
这是战场 我们在打仗
This is a war. It's a goddamn battle!

499
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:38,750
我重覆 我要你正面攻击
Now, I want that frontal attack. I repeat my order. Over.

500
01:08:38,830 --> 01:08:42,500
我拒绝率领兄弟作正面攻击
Colonel, I refuse to take my men up there in a frontal attack.

501
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:44,760
这等于是自杀
It's suicide, sir.

502
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:50,010
我和他们生活两年半 不能命令他们送死 完毕
I've lived with these men for two years, and I will not order them all to their deaths. Over.

503
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:01,610
这是很重大的决定
This is a very important decision, Staros.

504
01:09:05,190 --> 01:09:09,030
也许你有理由这么做
But if you feel that strongly, maybe you have a reason, so I'm coming down.

505
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:11,490
我要过去
Go take a look.

506
01:09:11,570 --> 01:09:14,280
我不是取消命令
I'm not rescinding my order to you, son,

507
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:19,210
不过如果是特殊状况 我会仔细考虑
but if I find extenuating circumstances when I get there, I'll take that into account.

508
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:23,590
你们守在那儿等我来
Now, in the meantime, goddamn it, I want you to hold on until I get there.

509
01:09:23,670 --> 01:09:27,880
可能的话叫那些兄弟前进 完毕
And, if possible, you get those men on the ridge out and moving! Out.

510
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,500
(希腊语)

511
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:43,730
哪里都一样
One spot's as good as another, men.

512
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:45,900
根本就无处可躲
There's no place to hide.

513
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:54,910
孩子 放松点
Just take it easy, son. Take it easy. Take it easy.

514
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:58,370
费夫呢?
Where's... where's Fife?

515
01:09:58,450 --> 01:10:00,660
在这儿 费夫
Fife? He's right here, son. Fife.

516
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:03,380
握住我的手
Hold my hand, Fife.

517
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:06,380
握我的手
Hold my hand.

518
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:13,550
抓住了
I got it.

519
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:19,640
我快死了
I'm dying, Fife.

520
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:48,840
连长...
Oh, Captain...

521
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:40,220
我被埋在棺材里
Shut up in a tomb.

522
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:44,480
掀不起棺盖
Can't lift the lid.

523
01:11:46,730 --> 01:11:49,020
我的处境进退两难
Played a role I never conceived.

524
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:53,320
穿上衣服 这不是海滩
Get that blouse on, soldier. It's not a goddamn bathing beach!

525
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,070
立刻穿上
Put it on right now.

526
01:11:55,150 --> 01:11:58,530
你在指谁? 去杀敌呀
What you aiming at, son? Let's go get those son of a bitches.

527
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:00,700
前进!
Move up!

528
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:14,210
你趴在这儿什么也看不到
What are you doing laying down there where you can't see a damn thing?

529
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:23,100
我正在观察 我派第一排上去
Observing, sir. Just sent First Platoon forward to the ridge.

530
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:26,810
- 这次有几个中弹? - 没有
- How many of 'em were hit this time? - None, sir.

531
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:28,980
一个都没有?
None? Not one?

532
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:33,940
这跟你说的情况不一样
Doesn't sound like the situation you described to me over the sound power.

533
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:38,610
五分钟前情况改变了
Well, it's not. The situation's changed just in the last five minutes, sir.

534
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:44,240
上尉 给我听住
Captain, you listen to me.

535
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:46,960
我们要全力向前进攻
We're going over there and taking everybody with us.

536
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,540
有问题吗?
Do you have any more complaints or demurrers?

537
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:54,300
- 现在 没有 - 好吧 你得照我的方法
- No, sir. Not now. - All right! We're gonna do things my way!

538
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:56,800
让我来指挥
My way! You understand that, Captain?

539
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:01,180
大家上去 晚上得攻下来
We're taking everybody over to that ledge! We may take that ridge by nightfall!

540
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:05,140
上面的火力还是很强
I think the ridge is quite a way from being reduced, sir.

541
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:14,820
神啊 你到底看到什么?
Show me how to see things the way you do.

542
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:20,360
让我知道你看到什么
Show me how to see things the way you do.

543
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:26,830
我们全是尘土
We're just dirt. We're just dirt.

544
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:52,940
留在这儿肯定送命
We're gonna get killed if we stay here.

545
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:56,270
比尔 带六个弟兄
Bell, take six men

546
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:58,440
上去探查
and go see what's up there.

547
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:06,870
我们会掩护你们
And we'll cover you the best we can from down there.

548
01:15:26,610 --> 01:15:28,070
好
OK.

549
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:30,660
你们留下来
You guys, you guys, stay here. OK?

550
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:33,870
我一个人去
I'm going alone.

551
01:17:13,470 --> 01:17:15,560
来吧
Come out.

552
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:22,980
到我的身边
Come out where lam.

553
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:34,220
上面有...上面有...
There was a... There was a...

554
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:38,220
上面有一座碉堡
There's a bunker... up there.

555
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:42,140
总共有五支机关枪
It's five guns.

556
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,770
五支机关枪
It's five guns.

557
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:54,070
攻下那些乱石间的碉堡
That strongpoint up there, somewhere up there around those rocks,

558
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,240
就能攻下这座山头
is the key to this ridge.

559
01:18:59,330 --> 01:19:01,450
比尔说得没错
Bell here is quite right.

560
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:07,250
日本鬼子从上面
From their knob up there, those little brown brothers can cover the whole of the ground

561
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:11,670
可以扫射一千码内的目标 不过他们漏掉这地方
in front of this position for 1,000 yards. They've left this ledge unguarded.

562
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:15,720
这是很严重的错误 这是很严重的错误
Now, goddamn it, that's a mistake. That's a hell of a mistake.

563
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:19,970
我们得利用他们的疏忽
We need to take advantage of it before they see their error.

564
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:25,850
我知道你们筋疲力尽
All right, all right, I know you're all pretty exhausted,

565
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:29,400
这里连清水也没有
and we've had a hell of a time getting water up here.

566
01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:33,190
对不起 我向大家道歉
For that I'm sorry. I apologise to you all.

567
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:38,990
不过明天若能攻下这座碉堡 就能占领山头
But if we can reduce this bunker tomorrow, I think we can take this ridge.

568
01:19:41,830 --> 01:19:44,160
有没有人自愿
So I'm asking for volunteers.

569
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:46,500
回去攻下那座碉堡
Go back up there and knock it out.

570
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:48,670
长官
Sir?

571
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:50,840
我愿意...
I'll be glad to go back up

572
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:53,260
- 身先士卒回去作战 - 很好 比尔
- and lead the way back for a party. - Right.

573
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:55,050
- 上校 我也去 - 还有你
- I'll go, sir. - You.

574
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,260
好的
All right.

575
01:19:57,340 --> 01:20:02,180
- 我很想率领突击队 - 我正希望你去 约翰
- I'd like to lead the party, Colonel. - All right, John. I was hoping you'd say that.

576
01:20:02,270 --> 01:20:05,180
- 你来指挥 - 我要去
- You'll be in command. - I'll go, sir.

577
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:06,640
- 长官 - 你
- Sir? - You.

578
01:20:06,730 --> 01:20:10,730
够了 七个人够多了 准备出发
All right, men, that's enough. Seven is plenty. Gather up.

579
01:20:14,530 --> 01:20:19,030
史塔奥 你知道这一役有多重要吗?
I don't know if you realise the importance of this operation, Staros.

580
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:23,620
攻下这座岛 轰炸机就能降落
Once our position is secured, we can move the bombers in.

581
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:27,670
我们的军队 便有一千英里的空中攻击力
That means air power for 1,000 miles in every direction.

582
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:32,210
窝达康拉尔岛一役能决定胜负
Guadalcanal may be the turning point in the war.

583
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:36,920
- 你不同意 一定得牺牲性命? - 不是 长官
- It'll cost lives. Is that what's troubling you? - No, sir.

584
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:43,060
我跟你说过胜利的重要
I explained to you the importance of this objective.

585
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:46,350
你认为牺牲多少兄弟才值得?
How many men do you think it's worth? How many lives?

586
01:20:46,430 --> 01:20:48,520
我不知道
I can't say, sir.

587
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:59,660
你愿意牺牲你的兄弟吗?
Are you prepared to sacrifice the lives of any of your men in this campaign?

588
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:04,240
多少? 一个? 两个?
How many? One? Two?

589
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,890
二十个?
Twenty?

590
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:11,430
你的小队一定会死人
Lives will be lost in your company, Captain.

591
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:17,190
要是你受不了 现在最好让我知道
And if you don't have the stomach for it, now is the time to let me know.

592
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:21,980
不 你说得对 你说得都对
No, sir. You're right... about everything you said.

593
01:21:22,070 --> 01:21:24,150
好吧 没事了
Fine, fine.

594
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:26,320
好吧 长官
That's all, Captain.

595
01:21:28,030 --> 01:21:30,120
还有一件事
One more thing, Staros.

596
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:35,160
你不必跟我说我说得对
It's not necessary for you to ever tell me that you think I'm right.

597
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:37,420
没有必要
Ever.

598
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,840
这是理所当然的
We'll assume it.

599
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:41,800
解散
Dismissed.

600
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:00,690
我为你感到遗憾
I feel sorry for you, kid.

601
01:22:02,070 --> 01:22:04,150
- 是吗? - 有一点吧
- Yeah? - Yeah, a little.

602
01:22:07,610 --> 01:22:09,700
这场仗会害死你
This army's gonna kill you.

603
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:19,170
你还是保佑自己好运点 别想救别人了
If you were smart, you'd take care of yourself. There's nothing you can do for anybody else.

604
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:23,420
就算你拼命也救不了什么人
You're just running into a burning house where nobody can be saved.

605
01:22:36,270 --> 01:22:41,110
在乱世中一个人的力量很渺小
What difference do you think you can make? One single man in all this madness.

606
01:22:46,650 --> 01:22:49,070
不要白白送死
If you die, it's gonna be for nothing.

607
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:57,870
没有另一个美好世界
There's not some other world out there where everything's gonna be OK.

608
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:00,040
这是唯一的世界
There's just this one.

609
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:04,040
只有这座孤岛
Just this rock.

610
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,500
来吧 让我死吧
Go ahead! Come on, come on.

611
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:46,710
谁能决定别人的生?
Who's deciding who's gonna live?

612
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:49,510
谁能决定别人的死?
Who's deciding who's gonna die?

613
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:53,470
太荒谬了
This is futile!

614
01:23:54,930 --> 01:24:00,020
看看我 我身上没有中弹
Look at me! I stand right up here and not one bullet.

615
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:02,190
毫发未伤!
Not one shot!

616
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:04,980
为什么?
Why?

617
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:07,360
他们全都死了
How come they all had to die?

618
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:11,900
我却站在这儿 一点事也没有
I can stand right here, I can stand right up and nothing happens to me!

619
01:24:32,420 --> 01:24:34,510
我们
We.

620
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:43,140
我们在一起
We together.

621
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:55,950
合而为一
One being.

622
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:13,260
水乳交融
Flow together like water,

623
01:25:16,550 --> 01:25:18,850
分不出你和我
till I can't tell you from me.

624
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:38,820
我爱你
I drink you.

625
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:42,950
现在
Now.

626
01:25:45,290 --> 01:25:47,370
现在
Now.

627
01:26:23,990 --> 01:26:26,080
您是我的明灯
You're my light.

628
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:31,420
我的指引
My guide.

629
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:43,950
我们在后面 要是攻破防线
John, I'll be behind you. If you wanna break through, we'll come after.

630
01:27:44,030 --> 01:27:46,580
就吹哨子通知我们冲上去
We'll charge at your whistle signal.

631
01:27:47,330 --> 01:27:49,830
去吧 去杀敌吧
All right, let's go, men. Go get 'em.

632
01:29:44,150 --> 01:29:46,240
好
OK.

633
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:49,910
你们留在底下
Stay down, below this ledge,

634
01:29:49,990 --> 01:29:54,000
我从上面叫出敌人方位
and I'll call down the data from above.

635
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:58,670
让炮兵密集轰炸这些岩石
Once the 81s have plastered that rock... as much as possible,

636
01:29:58,750 --> 01:30:02,550
再到大石旁找掩护
we're gonna crawl out along that big rock for cover

637
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:06,130
然后从右翼进攻
and then flank 'em to the right.

638
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:08,090
好吗?
OK?

639
01:30:09,590 --> 01:30:12,180
好...好
OK. OK.

640
01:30:32,870 --> 01:30:37,460

上吧
Let's go!

653
01:32:02,710 --> 01:32:06,130
从右翼攻上山头
OK, we're gonna continue on up the hill to the right.

654
01:32:06,210 --> 01:32:10,470
等我信号再开枪或丢手榴弹
Nobody fire or throw the grenades till I give the signal.

655
01:32:10,550 --> 01:32:12,630
好 咱们上
OK, let's do it.

656
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:30,240
他没事吧?
Is he OK? ls he all right?

657
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:32,700
不能把他带走 怎么办?
What we gonna do? Can't take him with us.

658
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:36,830
- 不能把他留下来 - 你们是同队兄弟 你陪他
- No, we can't leave him here. - He's from your platoon. You stay with him.

659
01:32:36,910 --> 01:32:40,910
我们回来再接他...如果他还活着
We can leave him and pick him up on the way back,... if he's still alive.

660
01:32:44,790 --> 01:32:47,210
- 他死了吗? - 还没有
- Is he dead? - Not yet.

661
01:32:47,290 --> 01:32:50,880
陪着他 掩护我们 冲吧
Dale, stay with him! Cover our flank! Move!

662
01:33:15,610 --> 01:33:16,700
小心后面
Behind you!

663
01:33:32,130 --> 01:33:34,220
我们被打得好惨
We're pinned down!

664
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:06,250
撤退
Fall back!

665
01:34:11,210 --> 01:34:12,670
走吧
Go!

666
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:25,870
小心
Watch out.

667
01:36:04,490 --> 01:36:05,950
安全了!
Clear!

668
01:36:58,170 --> 01:37:00,260
给我滚出来
Come on. Get out.

669
01:37:01,630 --> 01:37:03,720
出来
Go on.

670
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:08,810
你想杀我们?
Think you're soldiers?

671
01:37:15,810 --> 01:37:18,060
你这人渣
You piece of shit!

672
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,200
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch!

673
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:28,370
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch!

674
01:37:47,390 --> 01:37:49,470
如何?
All right?

675
01:37:52,220 --> 01:37:54,310
我杀死一个人
I shot a man.

676
01:38:29,550 --> 01:38:31,640
这里好臭
Stinks around here.

677
01:38:32,850 --> 01:38:36,390
- 这么多死人 - 鼻孔里塞烟头
- All these dead people. - Put a cigarette up your nose.

678
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:00,980
看他们逃命!
Look at 'em move!

679
01:40:01,060 --> 01:40:02,810
看他们逃命!
Look at 'em move!

680
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:04,770
把他们赶跑了
We got 'em on the run!

681
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:08,070
约翰 干得好 你把他们打得落花流水
Way to go, John. When they saw you make that attack and win,

682
01:40:08,150 --> 01:40:10,700
兄弟们都士气高涨
you put their hearts back into them.

683
01:40:10,780 --> 01:40:12,990
- 嘿 嘿 - 别打了
- Hey, hey! - Don't do that, soldier.

684
01:40:13,070 --> 01:40:17,910
把犯人带来 交给情报部 他们马上就来
Take care of the others. G-2 will want them. There'll be somebody around before long.

685
01:40:17,990 --> 01:40:20,460
浪费了很多时间 走吧
We've wasted enough time here. Let's go.

686
01:40:20,540 --> 01:40:23,290
我要推荐一些人接受勋章
Sir, I've a few recommendations for decorations.

687
01:40:23,370 --> 01:40:26,920
我会尽力向他们争取 但是迟些再说
Yes. We'll get everything for all of 'em that we can, but later.

688
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:31,470
不过我要你知道 我会推荐你接受勋章
Meantime, I want you to know I'm personally recommending you for something, John.

689
01:40:31,550 --> 01:40:33,010
也许是英勇奖章
Perhaps the big one.

690
01:40:33,090 --> 01:40:36,180
-  谢谢你 不过我... - 这是你应得的
- Thank you, sir, but I don't feel... - Yes, you do, John.

691
01:40:36,260 --> 01:40:39,100
能不能争取到才是问题
Getting it for you will be the goddamn problem!

692
01:40:39,180 --> 01:40:43,600
你能受勋对部队有很大鼓舞
But, hell, it'd be a big thing for the battalion and the regiment, if you did get it.

693
01:40:43,690 --> 01:40:45,350
最好赶快前进
We better move out.

694
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:49,980
加入别的部队攻上山头
We need to extend our lines, hook up with the other companies and push on to the top.

695
01:40:50,070 --> 01:40:53,030
你想指挥B队吗?
Would you like to take command of Baker Company?

696
01:40:53,110 --> 01:40:54,160
当然想
Of course.

697
01:40:54,240 --> 01:40:58,870
我不想扫你的兴 但是没有食水...
Sir, I don't mean to be a wet blanket, but about the water. If we don't get water...

698
01:40:58,950 --> 01:41:01,040
别担心水的问题
Don't worry about water.

699
01:41:02,540 --> 01:41:07,790
现在士气如虹 不能中断
John, I don't want anything to break up this attack of ours now we have the momentum.

700
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:11,420
过几个小时就有食用水
We'll have some water in a... couple of hours.

701
01:41:11,510 --> 01:41:13,590
我会安排的
I've arranged for that.

702
01:41:14,220 --> 01:41:17,720
该死 现在不能停下来
Now, we just can't stop now, goddamn it, and wait for it.

703
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,680
是的 长官
No, sir.

704
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:21,970
没错
That's right.

705
01:41:22,060 --> 01:41:27,860
如果有些人因脱水昏倒 那就让他们昏倒
And if some of the men... pass out, why, hell, they'll just have to pass out.

706
01:41:31,650 --> 01:41:33,530
好吧
All right.

707
01:41:33,610 --> 01:41:35,070
他们会死的
They could...

708
01:41:35,150 --> 01:41:38,490
他们也会被敌人杀死
They could die from it.They could die from enemy fire, too!

709
01:41:39,830 --> 01:41:42,120
他们很坚强
They're all tough boys.

710
01:41:46,870 --> 01:41:52,000
兄弟们 走吧 一路上会有更多死人
Come on, men, let's go! You'll see plenty more of those where we're going!

711
01:41:52,090 --> 01:41:54,670
到底要不要上山头?
Are we going up this hill or aren't we?

712
01:41:58,550 --> 01:42:02,520
我相信现在能突破日军防线
John, I'm convinced that the Japanese position can be broken now.

713
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:07,690
只要继续前进 日落时就能攻下山头
All we have to do is keep going and we'll have this hill. We'll have this hill by sundown.

714
01:42:07,770 --> 01:42:10,770
看到他们全新的斗志吗?
You see the spirit in these men? D'you see the new spirit?

715
01:42:10,860 --> 01:42:16,030
我们得一鼓作气 乘胜追击
Well, I want to take advantage of that before something happens to sap their strength.

716
01:42:16,110 --> 01:42:18,990
要是稍微迟疑就会战败
To have this battalion relieved in a defeat,

717
01:42:19,070 --> 01:42:22,530
或者是根本
or even to have it reinforced from troops

718
01:42:22,530 --> 01:42:26,000
攻不上山头
 from the reserves,if we were to stall before reaching the top, well,

719
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:30,330
天啊 我不能忍受失败
Jesus Christ, that's just a hell of a lot more than I could stand!

720
01:42:30,420 --> 01:42:32,800
我等了一辈子
I've waited all my life for this.

721
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:37,430
一直以来忍气吞声 都是为了这一刻
I've worked, slaved, eaten... oh, untold buckets of shit to have this opportunity!

722
01:42:37,510 --> 01:42:39,970
我不会半途而废
And I don't intend to give it up now.

723
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:46,810
你不知道被忽略的感受
You don't know what it feels like to be passed over.

724
01:42:46,890 --> 01:42:50,060
你刚出军校 还很年轻
I mean, you're young. You're just out of the Academy.

725
01:42:50,150 --> 01:42:55,820
你生对时代了 我等了十五年才等到这场战争
You're, you know, you've got your war! This 15 years, this is my first war!

726
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:04,620
有一天你会了解
John, some day you'll understand.

727
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:12,590
我把你当儿子看待
You're like a son to me, John.

728
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:17,050
知道我儿子做什么吗?
You know what my son does?

729
01:43:17,970 --> 01:43:20,050
他做鱼饵生意
He's a bait salesman.

730
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:24,720
你干得很好
You've done a hell of a job, John.

731
01:43:24,810 --> 01:43:29,690
我要让你得到应得的荣誉
I'm gonna make sure that you get everything, everything that you deserve.

732
01:43:31,940 --> 01:43:34,020
谢谢你 长官
Thank you, sir.

733
01:43:36,110 --> 01:43:38,190
天啊...
God...

734
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:41,740
该死 我要三名传令兵
Goddamn it! I want three runners!

735
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:43,490
给我三名传令兵
Get me three runners!

736
01:43:43,570 --> 01:43:45,830
回去找水源
You go back to the rear to find water

737
01:43:45,910 --> 01:43:48,790
马上运过来
and get back here with it as fast as you can!

738
01:43:49,710 --> 01:43:52,920
一小时后就全力进攻
We attack in one hour! We'll throw everything we got at 'em.

739
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,500
不能失败 没人能阻止
We're going all the way! Nothing'll stop us.

740
01:43:55,590 --> 01:43:57,670
晚上就得成功
It's high ground by nightfall!

741
01:44:21,820 --> 01:44:24,370
你看过死人吗?
You seen many dead people?

742
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:27,120
很多
Plenty.

743
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:29,830
跟死狗没两样
They're no different than dead dogs,

744
01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:32,620
只要有这种想法
once you get used to the idea.

745
01:44:37,460 --> 01:44:39,550
他们就像猪肉一样
They're meat, kid.

746
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:58,570
你们代表正义和善良吗?
Are you righteous? Kind?

747
01:45:01,650 --> 01:45:03,820
你们是否有信心?
Does your confidence lie in this?

748
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:09,330
受到大家爱护?
Are you loved by all?

749
01:45:11,620 --> 01:45:13,710
我跟你们一样
Know that I was, too.

750
01:45:17,290 --> 01:45:21,960
你们认为自己所受的苦难 是比较少吗?
Do you imagine your sufferings will be less because you loved goodness?

751
01:45:22,590 --> 01:45:24,680
我们善良有良知
Truth?

752
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:26,250
趴下来 趴下来
Get fucking on the ground! Get down! Get down!

753
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,090
趴下来 呆着
Get down. Stay there.

754
01:49:37,550 --> 01:49:41,430
给我趴下来 快点
Get on the ground! Get on the fucking ground!

755
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:43,390
快!
Now!

756
01:50:42,920 --> 01:50:45,000
这么可怕的邪恶
This great evil.

757
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:49,840
它来自哪里?
Where's it come from?

758
01:50:54,510 --> 01:50:56,600
怎么会潜伏在世上?
How'd it steal into the world?

759
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:11,910
原因和根源到底是什么?
What seed, what root did it grow from?

760
01:51:16,830 --> 01:51:18,910
这是谁造成的?
Who's doing this?

761
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:23,580
谁在屠杀众生
Who's killing us?

762
01:51:27,550 --> 01:51:30,050
剥夺我们的生命之火
Robbing us of life and light.

763
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:38,220
嘲笑我们对人间的依恋
Mocking us with the sight of what we might have known.

764
01:52:04,210 --> 01:52:06,920
战争对地球有利吗?
Does our ruin benefit the Earth?

765
01:52:09,300 --> 01:52:12,930
它能滋长万物 孕育众生吗?
Does it help the grass to grow or the sun to shine?

766
01:52:19,100 --> 01:52:21,390
上帝也有黑暗的一面?
Is this darkness in you, too?

767
01:52:27,860 --> 01:52:30,190
他是否也感受邪恶力量?
Have you passed through this night?

768
01:52:36,410 --> 01:52:38,950
我要把你开膛剖肚
I'm gonna sink my teeth into your liver.

769
01:52:42,660 --> 01:52:44,750
你死定了
You're dying.

770
01:52:56,680 --> 01:52:58,800
看到那些鸟吗?
See them birds up there?

771
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:02,850
它们会把你生吞活剥
You know they eat you raw?

772
01:53:07,770 --> 01:53:10,940
你下地狱就回不来
Where you're going, you're not coming back from.

773
01:53:17,430 --> 01:53:20,400
(日语)

774
01:54:22,430 --> 01:54:24,520
你对我有意义吗?
What are you to me?

775
01:54:30,310 --> 01:54:32,400
毫无义意
Nothing.

776
01:56:53,620 --> 01:56:55,710
坐下来
Have a seat here.

777
01:57:05,970 --> 01:57:08,760
史塔奥 我要将你革职
Staros, I'm relieving you of your command.

778
01:57:12,140 --> 01:57:14,520
班中尉会取代你
Lieutenant Band will take over for you.

779
01:57:16,230 --> 01:57:18,310
我跟他说了
I already told him.

780
01:57:28,700 --> 01:57:30,990
我也不想这么做
It's a hard thing to do.

781
01:57:31,790 --> 01:57:33,870
这是很困难的决定
Difficult decision to make.

782
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,170
你的心不够狠
I don't think you're tough enough.

783
01:57:40,670 --> 01:57:45,670
你心太软了 不够心狠手辣
You're too soft. You're just too soft-hearted. You're not tough-fibred enough.

784
01:57:50,220 --> 01:57:54,180
我的心意已定 没什么好说
Anyway, it's my decision to make. I've already made it.

785
01:57:54,890 --> 01:57:57,390
我不想让我的兄弟送死
I don't like to see my men get killed, sir.

786
01:58:05,650 --> 01:58:08,860
有人曾死在你怀里吗?
Have you ever had anyone die in your arms, sir?

787
01:58:08,950 --> 01:58:11,240
有吗?
Have you?

788
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:26,840
我不想引起事端
I don't see any reason to make a scandal out of this.

789
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:32,350
也不想在服役记录中留下污点
I don't want it in the records of the battalion. There's no reason for you to have it on yours.

790
01:58:32,430 --> 01:58:36,020
这和能力或胆量无关
This has nothing to do with cowardice or inefficiency.

791
01:58:39,310 --> 01:58:41,610
看看这座丛林
Look at this jungle.

792
01:58:41,690 --> 01:58:47,030
那些藤蔓缠绕着大树 吞食一切
Look at those vines, the way they twine around the trees, swallowing everything.

793
01:58:49,450 --> 01:58:51,740
大自然很残酷
Nature's cruel, Staros.

794
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:06,550
你可以申请调到华府的军法局
I'm going to let you apply for reassignment to the Judge Advocate General Corps

795
01:59:06,630 --> 01:59:08,510
就说你生了病
for reasons of ill health.

796
01:59:08,590 --> 01:59:09,970
你是律师
You're a lawyer.

797
01:59:10,050 --> 01:59:12,430
- 你得过虐疾吗? - 没有
- You had malaria yet? - No, I haven't.

798
01:59:12,510 --> 01:59:14,890
无所谓 我会安排的
Doesn't matter. I can fix that.

799
01:59:14,970 --> 01:59:17,220
反正你会染上的
Anyway, you probably will have it.

800
01:59:17,890 --> 01:59:20,980
我也会推荐你获颁银星勋章
I'm also recommending you for the Silver Star.

801
01:59:21,060 --> 01:59:25,230
我一定会让你无法推辞
And I'll recommend it in such a way it definitely won't be refused.

802
01:59:26,150 --> 01:59:28,780
干脆也让你得紫心奖章
Might as well have the Purple Heart, too.

803
01:59:31,450 --> 01:59:33,120
为什么?
Why?

804
01:59:33,200 --> 01:59:38,830
因为你脸上的疤 和手上的伤口
Because of that scratch on your face and because of those cuts on your hands.

805
01:59:38,910 --> 01:59:40,580
给我听好
Listen to me, Staros.

806
01:59:40,660 --> 01:59:44,710
你跟下一批伤兵离开
I think it's best you go back with the next batch of wounded and prisoners.

807
01:59:44,790 --> 01:59:48,590
留下来对你没好处
It is no goddamn good for you to keep hanging around.

808
01:59:48,670 --> 01:59:52,220
这件事不说出去最好
The quieter we keep this, the better it'll be for all.

809
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:29,130
这是多尔上校的宣布
This is from Colonel Tall.

810
02:00:30,630 --> 02:00:34,130
我们的胜利带来最高的荣耀
"Our victory gives us the highest reasons for pride".

811
02:00:35,220 --> 02:00:38,760
这是窝达康拉尔岛役的转捩点
"It will prove a milestone in the battle for Guadalcanal".

812
02:00:40,100 --> 02:00:45,100
明天师长会亲自来检阅前线
"Tomorrow the division commander will arrive to make an inspection of the line".

813
02:00:45,190 --> 02:00:50,440
接防部队会来换班
"After the inspection we're to be relieved by a battalion of the division's reserve regiment".

814
02:00:51,900 --> 02:00:56,160
我为全营兄弟 争取到一星期的假
"I've secured for the battalion a week's rest off the line".

815
02:01:00,410 --> 02:01:01,870
就这样
That's all.

816
02:02:57,320 --> 02:02:59,400
长夜漫漫
Hours like months.

817
02:03:02,160 --> 02:03:04,240
度日如年
Days like years.

818
02:03:07,580 --> 02:03:09,660
我正值青春年华
Walked into the golden age.

819
02:03:13,630 --> 02:03:16,210
站在新世界的边缘
Stood on the shores of the New World.

820
02:03:27,140 --> 02:03:30,100
我本来想去看你们
I would've come by and paid you guys a visit,

821
02:03:30,190 --> 02:03:31,850
不过...
but...

822
02:03:34,980 --> 02:03:37,610
我想一个人静一下
I just felt like being alone, you know?

823
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:41,490
是吗?
Yeah?

824
02:03:51,670 --> 02:03:53,750
我们要谢谢你
We wanted to thank you, sir.

825
02:03:57,800 --> 02:04:00,300
要求进行包抄行动
For asking to make that flanking move.

826
02:04:02,380 --> 02:04:04,470
为我们着想
For watching out for us.

827
02:04:06,510 --> 02:04:08,600
让我们团结一致
Keeping us together.

828
02:04:13,770 --> 02:04:15,860
你不该被调走
We're all sorry to see you go.

829
02:04:15,940 --> 02:04:18,110
这不公平
We feel like you got a rotten deal.

830
02:04:20,360 --> 02:04:23,530
我并不同意
Well, I'm not sure that you're right.

831
02:04:26,280 --> 02:04:28,160
最难的是
Tough part is...

832
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:32,540
不知道这么做有没有用
not knowing if you're doing any good.

833
02:04:34,420 --> 02:04:36,500
这才是最难的
That's the hard part.

834
02:04:38,250 --> 02:04:40,880
不过无所谓 我不在乎
But it doesn't matter. I don't care.

835
02:04:41,720 --> 02:04:43,800
我很高兴能离开
I'm glad to be going.

836
02:04:45,050 --> 02:04:47,010
真的很高兴
I'm glad.

837
02:04:47,100 --> 02:04:50,890
- 还是能提出申诉 - 为什么?
- There's still time. We could file a complaint. - For what?

838
02:04:51,980 --> 02:04:54,230
有什么用?
What good would that do?

839
02:04:55,940 --> 02:04:57,610
反正我想走
Anyway, I wanna go.

840
02:05:00,530 --> 02:05:02,990
别管它 算了吧
Leave it alone. Let it lay.

841
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:11,210
(希腊语)

842
02:05:15,580 --> 02:05:17,670
什么意思?
What does that mean, sir?

843
02:05:20,380 --> 02:05:22,710
你们像是我的孩子
It means "You've been like my sons".

844
02:05:33,980 --> 02:05:36,060
你们是我的孩子
You are my sons.

845
02:05:37,310 --> 02:05:39,400
我亲爱的孩子
My dear sons.

846
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:45,400
你们活在我心中
You live inside me now.

847
02:05:49,410 --> 02:05:51,490
永远与我同在
I'll carry you wherever I go.

848
02:06:07,510 --> 02:06:10,300
我忘不了战争的可怕
Can't nothing make you forget it.

849
02:06:14,020 --> 02:06:16,520
悲剧不断重演
Each time you start from scratch.

850
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:24,940
战争不能给我们荣耀
War don't ennoble men.

851
02:06:25,990 --> 02:06:28,280
只会把人变成野狗
It turns 'em into dogs.

852
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:36,160
荼毒我们的心灵
Poisons the soul.

853
02:07:40,140 --> 02:07:42,230
亲爱的妻子
My dear wife,

854
02:07:44,980 --> 02:07:51,570
战争的丑陋和血腥暴力 会让人丧失良知
you get something twisted out of your insides by all this blood, filth, and noise.

855
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:03,670
我很想保持纯真
I wanna stay changeless for you.

856
02:08:06,250 --> 02:08:09,260
我想以原来的我回到你身边
I wanna come back to you the man I was before.

857
02:08:17,260 --> 02:08:19,970
我们该如何获得宁静?
How do we get to those other shores?

858
02:08:23,810 --> 02:08:25,900
回到青山绿水间?
To those blue hills.

859
02:08:36,120 --> 02:08:37,780
真爱
Love.

860
02:08:47,340 --> 02:08:49,420
到底来自何方?
Where does it come from?

861
02:08:57,890 --> 02:08:59,970
谁燃起我们心中的爱火?
Who lit this flame in us?

862
02:09:07,020 --> 02:09:09,110
战争无法熄灭它
No war can put it out,

863
02:09:10,610 --> 02:09:12,690
或是征服它
conquer it.

864
02:09:20,540 --> 02:09:22,620
我曾是个囚犯
I was a prisoner.

865
02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:29,170
你让我自由
You set me free.

866
02:09:33,300 --> 02:09:35,840
不管你受过多少训练
No matter how much training you got,

867
02:09:36,970 --> 02:09:39,050
或是多么小心
how careful you are,

868
02:09:40,430 --> 02:09:43,890
只要运气不好就会阵亡
it's a matter of luck whether or not you get killed.

869
02:09:43,980 --> 02:09:49,230
不管你是谁 或是多么骁勇善战
Makes no difference who you are, or how tough a guy you might be,

870
02:09:51,270 --> 02:09:55,700
一不小心就会被杀死
if you're in the wrong spot at the wrong time, you're gonna get it.

871
02:10:06,410 --> 02:10:08,880
我看着那个人死去
I look at that boy dying,

872
02:10:10,380 --> 02:10:12,460
一点感觉都没有
I don't feel nothing.

873
02:10:15,720 --> 02:10:18,380
我对一切都不在乎
I don't care about nothing any more.

874
02:10:23,060 --> 02:10:25,140
听起来很幸福
Sounds like bliss.

875
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:31,690
我还没有那种感觉
I don't have that feeling yet.

876
02:10:33,110 --> 02:10:35,190
麻木不仁的感觉
That numbness.

877
02:10:36,240 --> 02:10:38,320
我跟你们不一样
Not like the rest of you guys.

878
02:10:42,660 --> 02:10:44,950
也许是因为我看得太多
Maybe cos I knew what to expect.

879
02:10:48,160 --> 02:10:50,420
根本就失去感觉
Maybe I was just frozen up already.

880
02:11:34,210 --> 02:11:37,710
我入伍后就没碰过女人
I haven't touched another woman since I was called up.

881
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:40,880
或跟女人说过话
Or talked to one.

882
02:11:44,890 --> 02:11:46,970
我不想...
I don't wanna...

883
02:11:47,680 --> 02:11:50,230
我不想有欲念
I don't wanna feel the desire.

884
02:12:27,350 --> 02:12:29,020
亚伯罕
All right. Abrahams!

885
02:12:29,100 --> 02:12:30,770
亚伯罕 你的信
Abrahams. Here you go.

886
02:12:30,850 --> 02:12:32,730
史狄 史狄呢?
Stack! Where's Stack?

887
02:12:32,810 --> 02:12:34,850
叫他来
Bring him out.

888
02:12:34,940 --> 02:12:37,020
比尔?
Bell?

889
02:12:37,110 --> 02:12:38,980
比尔!
Bell!

890
02:12:40,030 --> 02:12:42,530
另一封是比尔的 另一封是比尔的
Another one for Bell. Another one for Bell.

891
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:47,370
亲爱的积克
Dear Jack,

892
02:12:49,160 --> 02:12:54,330
我认识一个空军上尉 我爱上他
I've met an Air Force captain. I've fallen in love with him.

893
02:12:57,040 --> 02:12:59,340
我要跟你离婚嫁给他
I want a divorce to marry him.

894
02:13:05,680 --> 02:13:09,260
你可以拒绝 但我还是要说
I know you can say no, but I'm asking you anyway,

895
02:13:09,350 --> 02:13:12,140
毕竟我们曾夫妻一场
out of the memory of what we had together.

896
02:13:18,900 --> 02:13:20,980
原谅我
Forgive me.

897
02:13:21,940 --> 02:13:24,530
我太寂寞了
It just got too lonely, Jack.

898
02:13:44,840 --> 02:13:46,930
我们会再见
We'll meet again some day.

899
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:54,680
我们一定会再见面的
People who have been as close as we've been always meet again.

900
02:14:03,150 --> 02:14:05,990
我无权跟你这么说
I have no right to speak to you this way.

901
02:14:06,070 --> 02:14:08,360
不过我忍不住
I can't stop myself.

902
02:14:08,870 --> 02:14:10,950
习惯成自然
A habit so strong.

903
02:14:13,120 --> 02:14:15,750
你曾是我最好的朋友
Oh, my friend of all those shining years.

904
02:14:19,880 --> 02:14:21,960
帮助我离开你
Help me leave you!

905
02:15:49,060 --> 02:15:51,140
你叫什么?
What's your name?

906
02:17:03,170 --> 02:17:05,260
我们曾是一家人
We were a family.

907
02:17:08,510 --> 02:17:11,100
不得已被拆散
How'd it break up and come apart?

908
02:17:14,350 --> 02:17:17,850
现在我们自相残杀
So that now we're turned against each other.

909
02:17:19,730 --> 02:17:22,320
断送彼此的生路
Each standing in the other's light.

910
02:17:31,530 --> 02:17:34,160
我们怎么会失去善良本性?
How did we lose the good that was given us?

911
02:17:35,960 --> 02:17:38,040
泯灭天理良知
Let it slip away?

912
02:17:40,840 --> 02:17:42,920
将人性弃之不顾
Scatter it careless?

913
02:18:03,610 --> 02:18:06,030
我们为什么无法升华?
What's keeping us from reaching out?

914
02:18:06,650 --> 02:18:08,740
达到光荣的巅峰?
Touching the glory?

915
02:18:10,780 --> 02:18:16,700
如果我是日军你早就死了
I'd have had you, Witt, if you was a Jap,Long ago.

916
02:18:18,290 --> 02:18:20,370
你得留下来?
They leave you here?

917
02:18:21,920 --> 02:18:23,420
对
Yup.

918
02:18:23,500 --> 02:18:25,590
我会拖累他们
I slowed 'em up.

919
02:18:26,260 --> 02:18:28,170
我不介意
Don't mind, really.

920
02:18:29,180 --> 02:18:31,970
医官帮我包扎得很好
The medic fixed me up pretty good.

921
02:18:32,090 --> 02:18:34,180
我有很多弹药
I got plenty of ammo.

922
02:18:36,850 --> 02:18:39,480
一定会有人来接我
Somebody'll be along for me eventually.

923
02:18:44,570 --> 02:18:46,860
- 你伤不轻 - 膝盖中弹
- They got you good. - Right in the knee.

924
02:18:46,940 --> 02:18:48,650
是啊
Yeah.

925
02:18:48,740 --> 02:18:51,320
我不必再打仗了 威特
I'm out of this war for good, Witt.

926
02:18:56,620 --> 02:19:00,210
- 你在这儿干嘛? - 只是 你知道
- What you doin' down here? - Just, you know,

927
02:19:00,290 --> 02:19:02,580
我要回到连上
I'm heading back to the company.

928
02:19:03,250 --> 02:19:04,920
好
Yeah.

929
02:19:05,750 --> 02:19:08,050
跟大伙儿问好
Well, you give all them boys my best.

930
02:19:08,130 --> 02:19:10,590
你可以跟我来
You can come with me if you want.

931
02:19:10,680 --> 02:19:12,800
我扶你
I'll help you along.

932
02:19:14,430 --> 02:19:17,010
不了 这里很好
No, it's nice and quiet.

933
02:19:17,100 --> 02:19:19,180
很安静
Peaceful up here.

934
02:19:21,560 --> 02:19:24,730
我会拖累你 剖队会接我
I'd just slow you up. There'll be somebody along.

935
02:19:28,610 --> 02:19:30,700
我会提醒他们
I'll remind 'em.

936
02:19:31,150 --> 02:19:33,240
好
OK.

937
02:21:08,460 --> 02:21:10,540
嘿 威特
Hey, Witt.

938
02:21:15,090 --> 02:21:17,260
今天你惹了什么麻烦?
Who you making trouble for today?

939
02:21:18,300 --> 02:21:20,390
什么意思?
What d'you mean?

940
02:21:21,140 --> 02:21:24,310
你不是最爱惹麻烦吗?
Well, isn't that what you like to do?

941
02:21:24,390 --> 02:21:27,060
叫你向左你偏偏向右
Turn left when they say go right?

942
02:21:33,900 --> 02:21:36,400
你为什么这么爱惹麻烦?
Why are you such a troublemaker, Witt?

943
02:21:38,820 --> 02:21:41,370
你很关心我 对吧?
You care about me, don't you, Sergeant?

944
02:21:42,740 --> 02:21:44,830
我一直都这么觉得
I always felt like you did.

945
02:21:46,660 --> 02:21:49,380
你为什么装得冷酷无情?
Why do you always make yourself out like a rock?

946
02:21:50,670 --> 02:21:53,050
有时我跟你聊得很愉快
One day I can come up and talk to you,

947
02:21:54,090 --> 02:21:57,970
隔一天 我们就像没见过面似的
by the next day it's like we never even met.

948
02:22:12,310 --> 02:22:14,400
好孤单的房子
Lonely house now.

949
02:22:17,070 --> 02:22:19,160
你会觉得孤单吗?
You ever get lonely?

950
02:22:19,240 --> 02:22:21,320
只有在人群中
Only around people.

951
02:22:23,240 --> 02:22:25,330
只有在人群中
Only around people.

952
02:22:29,960 --> 02:22:33,380
你还是有美好的信念 对吧?
You still believing in the beautiful light, are you?

953
02:22:40,970 --> 02:22:43,050
你怎么办得到?
How do you do that?

954
02:22:44,720 --> 02:22:46,810
你就像是魔术师
You're a magician to me.

955
02:22:55,860 --> 02:22:57,940
你眼中仍有一丝良知
I still see a spark in you.

956
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:28,540
有人看到死去小鸟的眼中 只有无言的痛楚
One man looks at a dying bird and thinks there's nothing but unanswered pain.

957
02:23:31,250 --> 02:23:33,340
不过死亡是无情的
But death's got the final word.

958
02:23:36,430 --> 02:23:38,510
死神在嘲笑他
It's laughing at him.

959
02:23:47,810 --> 02:23:50,310
有人看着同一只小鸟
Another man sees that same bird,

960
02:23:53,230 --> 02:23:55,320
却看到生命光辉
feels the glory.

961
02:24:00,370 --> 02:24:02,870
心中充满喜悦
Feels something smiling through him.

962
02:25:00,220 --> 02:25:02,680
我们得马上撤退
We need to get out of here right now.

963
02:25:02,760 --> 02:25:07,350
- 你跟指挥部说过吗? - 没有
- You explain to... headquarters the situation? - No.

964
02:25:07,430 --> 02:25:11,520
他们知道我们在这儿吗?
Do they know where we are? Cos we're sitting ducks out here.

965
02:25:12,690 --> 02:25:16,230
我们死定了 这要由我决定
Well, I think that's... up to me to judge, Sergeant.

966
02:25:17,860 --> 02:25:23,450
我们得派人去看敌军有多近 好吗?
I think we just need to send somebody up there and find out how close they are. OK?

967
02:25:23,530 --> 02:25:25,410
很容易
It's easy.

968
02:25:25,490 --> 02:25:28,870
韦特 联络指挥部
Hey, Weld... get headquarters on that thing.

969
02:25:28,950 --> 02:25:30,870
炮声越来越近
The fire's coming closer, sir.

970
02:25:30,960 --> 02:25:32,000
没有讯号
Line's cut!

971
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:39,170
我们得派人查出原因
We need to send somebody out there to find out where that line is being cut.

972
02:25:39,260 --> 02:25:41,880
和敌人有多近
And we need to find out how close they are.

973
02:25:41,970 --> 02:25:43,510
来吧
Come on.

974
02:25:43,590 --> 02:25:46,140
好吧 好吧
OK. OK.

975
02:25:50,270 --> 02:25:52,350
嘿 你
Hey, you.

976
02:25:52,980 --> 02:25:54,230
你去
You go.

977
02:25:55,230 --> 02:25:56,900
费夫 你要去
You're going, Fife.

978
02:26:02,530 --> 02:26:05,530
古恩 你也去
Coombs. You go, too.

979
02:26:05,620 --> 02:26:07,280
快点
Come on!

980
02:26:07,370 --> 02:26:11,910
我也去 这整个任务都不对
I'll go. I want you to know I think the whole thing's a bad idea, though.

981
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:17,040
要是他们全力进攻 我们肯定没命
If they come down here in any strength, Lieutenant, they'll knock our position to hell.

982
02:26:17,130 --> 02:26:19,590
你不必去 别人会去
You don't have to go. Others'll volunteer.

983
02:26:19,670 --> 02:26:24,800
我想要去 万一出事我要在场
No, I wanna go, sir. In case something bad happens, I wanna be there.

984
02:26:24,890 --> 02:26:27,390
好吧 顺着河走
All right. You stay by the river.

985
02:26:27,470 --> 02:26:30,390
丛林很浓密 小心点
That jungle's too thick. And be very careful.

986
02:26:30,470 --> 02:26:32,560
我会的
I will.

987
02:26:32,640 --> 02:26:34,600
祝好运 威特
Good luck, Witt.

988
02:26:34,690 --> 02:26:36,810
费夫 你没事吧?
You OK, Fife?

989
02:28:03,980 --> 02:28:06,610
敌军的增援部队
A reinforce battalion.

990
02:28:08,200 --> 02:28:09,860
我们得回去
We need to go back.

991
02:28:09,950 --> 02:28:11,830
告诉连长
Tell the lieutenant.

992
02:28:15,620 --> 02:28:17,500
走吧
Let's go.

993
02:28:34,760 --> 02:28:36,850
我中弹了
I'm hit!

994
02:29:35,780 --> 02:29:38,580
有人得留下来阻挡敌军
One of us needs to stay here and hold 'em off.

995
02:29:45,710 --> 02:29:47,800
我们不会有事的
We'll be all right.

996
02:29:52,800 --> 02:29:55,800
我的朋友活不久了
My friend here doesn't have long,

997
02:29:55,890 --> 02:29:58,810
你们回去吧
so... you go.

998
02:30:00,020 --> 02:30:01,480
快去吧
You go on ahead.

999
02:30:24,710 --> 02:30:26,790
威特
Witt!

1000
02:31:12,630 --> 02:31:14,720
他们来了
They're coming.

1001
02:31:16,180 --> 02:31:19,510
我得走了 你不要
I gotta go. I don't want you to be afraid.

1002
02:31:20,260 --> 02:31:24,430
听到枪声就躲起来 然后再顺着河走下去
Just hide out here till you hear firing, then push on down the river.

1003
02:31:24,520 --> 02:31:25,980
不
No.

1004
02:32:06,230 --> 02:32:09,900
- 古恩呢? - 快撤退 敌人来了
- Where's Coombs? - Get back. Get back, they're coming.

1005
02:32:10,860 --> 02:32:12,940
撤退
Fall back.

1006
02:32:14,440 --> 02:32:16,990
威特呢? 费夫 威特在哪儿?
Where's Witt? Fife, where's Witt?

1007
02:32:23,200 --> 02:32:25,290
费夫 威特呢?
Fife, where's Witt?

1008
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:32,000
威特在哪儿?
Fife. Fife, where's Witt?

1009
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:20,830
(日语)

1010
02:37:06,200 --> 02:37:08,280
你的生命光辉呢?
Where's your spark now?

1011
02:37:31,050 --> 02:37:35,140
我知道你们在喝私酿酒
Now, I know you men have been making and drinking this goddamn swipe.

1012
02:37:35,220 --> 02:37:36,480
没关系
That's OK by me.

1013
02:37:36,560 --> 02:37:38,270
一切都是谎言...
Everything a lie.

1014
02:37:38,350 --> 02:37:42,020
在我的部队可以尽管喝酒
Any man in my outfit can get as drunk as he wants to every night.

1015
02:37:42,110 --> 02:37:44,230
...你见到和听到的一切
Everything you hear and see.

1016
02:37:44,320 --> 02:37:48,490
只要能执行任务就没问题
As long as he's in shape to make reveille and carry out any assignment given.

1017
02:37:48,570 --> 02:37:52,450
要是不行...他就会有麻烦
If he can't do that, he's gonna have trouble from me.

1018
02:37:52,530 --> 02:37:56,370
- 他们都在说谎 - 我是个注重家庭的人
- So much to spew out. - I prefer to think of myself as a family man,

1019
02:37:56,450 --> 02:37:59,670
大家才会在一起
and that's what we all are here, whether we like it or not.

1020
02:37:59,750 --> 02:38:01,830
我们是一家人
We are a family.

1021
02:38:02,920 --> 02:38:05,090
我是父亲
I'm the father.

1022
02:38:05,760 --> 02:38:08,840
副连长就是母亲
Guess that makes Sergeant Welsh here the mother.

1023
02:38:08,920 --> 02:38:11,640
他们一个接一个来
They just keep coming, one after another.

1024
02:38:11,720 --> 02:38:15,010
你们都是我的孩子
That makes you all the children in this family.

1025
02:38:15,100 --> 02:38:18,640
一家之主是父亲
Now, a family can have only one head, and that is the father.

1026
02:38:18,730 --> 02:38:23,400
男主外女主内 这就是规矩
Father's the head, mother runs it. That's the way it's gonna work here.

1027
02:38:23,480 --> 02:38:27,190
- 要是你们想见我 - 我们被困在棺材里
- If any of you wanna see me about anything, - You're in a box.

1028
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:29,400
- 只要有任何事 - 移动的棺材
- anything at all, - A moving box.

1029
02:38:29,490 --> 02:38:31,570
我都会在
you will find that I am available.

1030
02:38:31,660 --> 02:38:34,620
战争在圣诞节前不会结束
This war is not gonna be over by next Christmas.

1031
02:38:34,700 --> 02:38:37,660
还要很久才能回家
It's gonna be a long time before we get home...

1032
02:38:37,750 --> 02:38:39,830
他们要我们牺牲
They want you dead.

1033
02:38:42,210 --> 02:38:44,290
或相信他们的谎言
Or in their lie.

1034
02:38:49,510 --> 02:38:51,590
我们只有一个办法
Only one thing a man can do.

1035
02:38:54,600 --> 02:38:56,680
找到自己的出路
Find something that's his.

1036
02:38:59,930 --> 02:39:02,020
逃到属于自己的小岛
Make an island for himself.

1037
02:39:15,490 --> 02:39:17,990
我这一生若不相信上帝
If I never meet you in this life,

1038
02:39:19,410 --> 02:39:21,500
将会有所缺憾
Let me feel the lack.

1039
02:39:30,050 --> 02:39:34,470
上帝怜悯我 我就属于他
A glance from your eyes, and my life will be yours.

1040
02:40:23,600 --> 02:40:27,650
我只期望有一天能回家
Somethin' I can come back to. Some kind of foundation.

1041
02:40:27,810 --> 02:40:32,400
我不知道你有何打算 但...
I mean, I don't know what, you know, what your plans are, but...

1042
02:40:32,490 --> 02:40:36,490
吃了这么多苦 我已经觉悟
I'm determined now. I've been through the thick and thin of it.

1043
02:40:36,570 --> 02:40:39,910
我还年轻 不过经历苦难
You know, I may be young, but I've lived plenty of life.

1044
02:40:40,620 --> 02:40:42,870
我准备好好活下去
I'm ready to start living it good.

1045
02:40:42,950 --> 02:40:47,920
我爸常说 苦尽甘来
You know, my daddy always told me it's gonna get a lot worse before it gets better.

1046
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:52,550
年轻人的日子不应该那么苦
You know, cos life ain't supposed to be that hard when you're young.

1047
02:40:52,630 --> 02:40:56,300
我猜最苦的已经熬过去了
Well, I figure after this the worst is gonna be gone.

1048
02:40:57,010 --> 02:41:00,600
往后会渐入佳境 这是我的愿望
It's time for things to get better. That's what I want.

1049
02:41:01,600 --> 02:41:03,680
一定能够实现
That's what's gonna happen.

1050
02:41:04,810 --> 02:41:06,890
我长大了
I'm getting older now.

1051
02:41:07,730 --> 02:41:10,230
我变得比较成熟
By no means old, but older.

1052
02:41:11,020 --> 02:41:14,190
我们曾经在哪里一起渡过
Where is it that we were together?

1053
02:41:17,360 --> 02:41:19,660
你们曾跟我一起生活
Who were you that I lived with?

1054
02:41:24,370 --> 02:41:26,460
你们是什么人? 
Walked with?

1055
02:41:33,590 --> 02:41:35,670
是兄弟
The brother.

1056
02:41:42,180 --> 02:41:44,270
也是朋友
The friend.

1057
02:42:10,580 --> 02:42:12,670
黑暗和光明
Darkness from light.

1058
02:42:14,170 --> 02:42:16,260
仇恨和爱
Strife from love.

1059
02:42:17,420 --> 02:42:20,550
全都来自同一个心灵
Are they the workings of one mind?

1060
02:42:21,930 --> 02:42:24,680
拥有同一张脸孔吗?
The features of the same face?

1061
02:42:39,570 --> 02:42:41,660
我的灵魂
Oh, my soul,

1062
02:42:43,280 --> 02:42:45,370
让我相信上帝
Let me be in you now.

1063
02:42:51,420 --> 02:42:53,710
透过我的双眼观看世界
Look out through my eyes.

1064
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,500
看着您创造的万物
Look out at the things you made.

1065
02:43:02,430 --> 02:43:04,720
散发生命光辉
All things shining.
