00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:29,185
You know, my stepdaddy took a block
and beat me when I was real little.

161
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,105
And I - I was scared. And I used to run.
I used to hide.

162

coop a whole lot of nights.

I never thought it'd get
no worse than that.

over here. I'm counting the seconds.

There's gonna be air raids.

before we get off the beach.

a big floating graveyard.

470
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:08,531
if they send us up some
reinforcements, maybe we could, uh...

471
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:11,701
scout around and locate
these machine guns.

Anyway, it's better than going
back down through that.

- Something's coming. They're coming.

What are they doin'? If they
wanna throw us out of here...

00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:28,009
why - why didn't
they come in force?

476
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:30,887
Maybe they was
acting on their own.

477
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:33,765
Maybe they wanted to get into nirvana.

You write my old lady. You tell her -
I want her to know I died like a man.

still some water in there.

At least I could get a syrette

And you move 'em by the

Then you get that second platoon
- you move 'em over to the hill!
