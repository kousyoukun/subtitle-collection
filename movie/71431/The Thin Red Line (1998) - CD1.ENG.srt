1
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,040
What's this war in the heart of nature?

2
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,880
Why does nature vie with itself?

3
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,520
The land contend with the sea?

4
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,080
Is there an avenging power in nature?

5
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,240
Not one power, but two?

6
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,920
I remember my mother when she was dying.

7
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,200
Looked all shrunk up and grey.

8
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,400
I asked her if she was afraid.

9
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,040
She just shook her head.

10
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,080
I was afraid to touch the death I seen in her.

11
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,560
I couldn't fiind nothing beautiful or uplifting
about her going back to God.

12
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,560
I heard people talk about immortality,
but I ain't seen it.

13
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,640
I wondered how it'd be when I died.

14
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,400
What it'd be like to know that this breath now
was the last one you was ever gonna draw.

15
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,560
I just hope I can meet it the same way she did.

16
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,200
With the same... calm.

17
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,560
Cos that's where it's hidden -
the immortality I hadn't seen.

18
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,520
Kids around here never fight.

19
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,960
Sometimes.

20
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,920
Sometimes when you see them playing

21
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,080
they always fight!

22
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,280
- Is she afraid of me?
- Little bit.

23
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,840
- Are you afraid of me?
- Yes.

24
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,920
- Why?
- Cos you look...

25
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,200
You look as an army!

26
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,280
- I look army?
- Yes.

27
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,960
Well, that don't matter.

28
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,600
It doesn't matter.

29
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,920
- Baby's tired.
- Yes.

30
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,800
If she swims, she wants, she will sleep.

31
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,360
All right, come on. Turn around.

32
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,440
Go, go, go, go. Go!

33
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,240
Come on, go.

34
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Go, go, go, go!

35
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,440
Witt, patrol boat!

36
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,520
She's American.

37
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,960
What's it doing out here all alone?

38
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,560
You haven't changed at all, have you, Witt?

39
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,840
You haven't learned a thing.

40
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,880
All a man has to do is leave it to you,
you'll putyour head in the noose for him.

41
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
How many times you been AWOL?

42
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,480
Been in the army, what? Six years now?

43
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,400
Ain't it time you smartened up
and stopped being such a punk recruit?

44
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,480
I mean, if you're ever gonna.

45
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,560
We can't all be smart.

46
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,480
No, we can't, and that's a shame.

47
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,560
Look atyou.

48
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,160
Truth is,
you can't take straight duty in my company.

49
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,920
You'll never be a real soldier,
not in God's world.

50
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,040
This is C Company,
of which I'm First Sergeant. I run this outfit.

51
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,760
Captain Staros, he's the CO, but I'm the guy
who runs it. Nobody's gonna foul that up.

52
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,520
You're just another mouth for me to feed.

53
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,680
Normally, you'd be court-martialled.

54
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,160
But I worked a deal for ya.

55
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,240
Gotta consider yourself lucky.

56
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,320
I'm sending you to a disciplinary outfit.

57
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,640
You'll be a stretcher-bearer.
You'll be taking care of the wounded.

58
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,760
I can take anything you dish out.

59
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,080
I'm twice the man you are.

60
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,080
In this world...

61
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,640
a man himself is nothing.

62
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,040
And there ain't no world but this one.

63
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,640
You're wrong there, Top.

64
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
I seen another world.

65
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,400
Sometimes I think
it was just... my imagination.

66
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,720
Well,

67
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,400
then you've seen things I never will.

68
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,960
We're living in a world that's blowing itself
to hell as fast as everybody can arrange it.

69
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,640
In a situation like that all a man can do
is shut his eyes and let nothing touch him.

70
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,720
Look out for himself.

71
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,080
I might be the best friend you ever had.

72
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,200
You don't even know it.

73
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,640
He hates you worse than poison.

74
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,560
I never felt he hated me, cos I don't hate him.

75
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,840
I love Charlie Company.

76
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,600
They're my people.

77
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,280
They call it "The Rock".

78
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,480
Nobody wants this island.
Japs just put an airfield there.

79
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,360
Fighting's confined to this area.

80
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,800
This is their road to Australia, and this is their
way of controlling the sea lanes to America.

81
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,880
If we're gonna stop the Japs' advance into the
South Pacific, we've gotta do it right there.

82
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,280
The Marines have done their job.
Now it's our turn.

83
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,680
Worked my ass off.

84
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,160
Brown-nosed the generals.

85
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,320
Degraded myself

86
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,160
for them and my family.

87
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,400
For my home.

88
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,200
- I admire you, Colonel. I do.
- Thank you, sir.

89
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,120
Most men your age
would have retired by now.

90
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
It's OK.

91
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,720
We need general officers
with maturity and character like you.

92
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,040
We've got good sergeants
and good lieutenant colonels.

93
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,360
But once a man gets those eagles,
he can't wait to get that star.

94
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,440
He becomes a politician, right?

95
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,520
Goes along to get along.

96
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,040
So goddamn hard to stay upright.

97
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,000
- You said it there, sir.
- With the Admiral watching, which he will be.

98
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,880
- There's always someone watching.
- Yeah.

99
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,800
Like a hawk.

100
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,880
Always someone ready to jump in,
if you're not.

101
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,720
- D'you have a son, Colonel?
- Yes, sir.

102
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,040
Good. We don't want our sons or grandsons
fighting this war 30 years from now, do we?

103
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,520
- No, sir, we sure don't.
- Then you crush 'em without mercy.

104
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,520
You dig them out of the hills
and protect that airfield.

105
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,400
Yes, sir.

106
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:19,400
You wonder why... Why did the Japs
put an airfield there of all places?

107
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,400
I guess we don't knowthe bigger picture,
if there is such a thing.

108
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,400
- What do you think?
- Well, sir, I never ask myself that question.

109
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,080
You're a humble man.

110
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,200
Nobody wants that island... butyou.

111
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,640
How much do you want it?

112
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,040
As much as I have to, sir.

113
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,720
All they sacrifiicedfor me

114
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,280
poured out like water on the ground.

115
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,640
All I might have given for love's sake.

116
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,560
Too late.

117
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,200
Died...

118
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,560
slow as a tree.

119
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,720
D'you feel it?

120
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,400
Yes, sir.

121
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,360
Thank you, sir.

122
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,360
Take topside to the signal bridge.

123
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,320
The closer you are to Caesar,
the greater the fear.

124
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,800
I just can't help
how damn scared I am, sarge, all right?

125
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,400
I can't help it. I got...

126
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,720
My stepdaddy took a block
and beat me when I was real little

127
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,480
and I was scared
and I used to run, I used to hide.

128
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,080
Hell, I slept in the chicken coop
a whole lot of nights.

129
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,160
And I never thought
it'd get no worse than that.

130
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,080
But I'm living by the... by the minute here.
I'm counting the seconds.

131
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,440
Hell, we're gonna be landing soon
and there's gonna be air raids.

132
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,800
We're probably gonna die
before we get off the beach.

133
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,720
This place is...
It's like a big floating graveyard.

134
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,840
- What's your name, kid?
- I wanna own an automobile when I get out.

135
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,920
- What's your name?
- Edward, Edward B Train.

136
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,040
Train?

137
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:09,320
The only things that are permanent
is, is dying and the Lord. That's it.

138
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:15,080
That's all you gotta worry about. This war
ain't... gonna be the end of me or you neither.

139
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,360
- Think we'll catch an air raid?
- How in the hell should I know?

140
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,000
All's I know are them crew guys said
they didn't catch no air raid the last time.

141
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,520
On the other hand,
time before last they nearly got blew up.

142
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,400
What d'you want me to tell you?

143
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,400
You're a big help, Tills.
Nothing. Tell me nothing.

144
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,880
Tell you something.

145
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,360
We're sitting out here on this ocean
like a couple of fuckin' ducks in these boats.

146
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,320
I already knowthat.

147
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,080
Well, brood on it, Tills.

148
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,360
Brood on it.

149
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,720
- Ain'tyou watching the fun?
- I ain't interested.

150
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,080
- Yeah, I guess it is pretty crowded.
- Wouldn't be interested, even if it wasn't.

151
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,840
Well, I'm on my way to get me that pistol.

152
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,520
Yeah? Well, have fun.

153
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,720
Yeah, have fun.

154
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:02,440
You'll wish you had one once we get ashore
and run into some of them samurai sabres.

155
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,000
Open this door! Open this goddamn door!

156
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,880
Open the door!

157
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,360
You all learn to deal these cards...

158
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,880
All right. Here I am sleeping, yeah.

159
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,040
All right, ladies.
Is this a sewing circle or a card game?

160
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,720
All right, jack's high, jackto bet.
Robert's got two jacks.

161
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,440
I never bargained for nothing like this when I
signed up for this man's army before the war.

162
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:37,120
How was I supposed to knowthere was
gonna be a fuckin' war, huh? Answer me that.

163
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,800
All I know is Charlie Company's
always getting screwed. Always.

164
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,520
And I can tell you whose fault it is, too.

165
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,480
It's that captain of ours.

166
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,160
First he gets us stuck off on this boat
where we don't know a fucking soul.

167
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,480
Then he gets us stuck way down in fourth
place on the list to get off this son of a bitch.

168
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
Hello, Captain.

169
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,320
I read in your 201file
that you were an officer before the war.

170
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,960
How'd you end up a private?

171
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,040
Cos of my wife.

172
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,880
I was in the corps of engineers.

173
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,960
We'd never been separated before,

174
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,040
not even for a night.

175
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,680
I took it for four months and then I quit.

176
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,520
Just resigned.

177
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,080
They sent me backto the States.

178
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,120
They told me
I'd never get another commission.

179
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,640
They said they'd see to it I got drafted
and that I for damn sure'd be in the infantry.

180
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,240
Sons of bitches.

181
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,840
No, I don't blame them.

182
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,160
Well, where is she now?

183
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
She's home.

184
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,160
Why should I be afraid to die?

185
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,080
I belong to you.

186
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,960
Move! Move! Move!

187
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,040
Move! Move!

188
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,080
Move! Move!

189
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,360
Moving out!

190
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,440
If I go fiirst, I'll wait for you there.

191
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,040
On the other side of the dark waters.

192
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,040
Put your helmet on.

193
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,120
Be with me now.

194
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,160
- Feeling the pressure, Captain?
- Yes, sir.

195
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,680
I like you, Captain.

196
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:02,040
And I just wantyou to know, well,
we're in this thing together. All right?

197
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,040
Keep pressing inland till you reach the line.
I'll catch up with you there.

198
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,920
- Yes, sir.
- It's all yours, Captain.

199
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,360
Gangway! Gangway there!

200
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,840
Coming through!

201
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,720
Squad leaders! Both teams!

202
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,040
This way, son. This way, right here.

203
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,040
Stand by to go over the side!

204
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,960
Our Father, who art in heaven...

205
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,640
And forgive us our debts,
as we forgive our debtors.

206
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,200
For Thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glory.

207
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,360
Your outfit's lucky.

208
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,440
Transports must've been spotted.

209
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,320
You're getting outta here just ahead of time.

210
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,680
Take a breath, mister. You gotta breathe!

211
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,200
- You Charlie Company?
- Yeah.

212
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,280
We went in a mile. Nothing there.

213
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,800
Some oil drums.
There'd be nothing there for...

214
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,200
- A week.
- A week, sir.

215
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,640
No casualties. Japs must've hauled ass.

216
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,640
Two mortars hit the beach,
but most guys came in standing up.

217
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,520
Darnedest thing I ever did see.

218
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,360
They got fish that live in trees.

219
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:08,200
If they didn't knowthis beach was deserted,
what else don't they know?

220
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,280
Who are you to live in all these many forms?

221
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,360
Your death that captures all.

222
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,280
You, too, are the source
of all that's gonna be born.

223
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,440
Your glory.

224
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,600
Mercy.

225
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,080
Peace.

226
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,960
Truth.

227
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,520
You give calm a spirit,

228
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,440
understanding,

229
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,160
courage.

230
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,640
The contented heart.

231
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,880
Get a medic here!

232
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:06,240
Maybe all men got one big soul
who everybody's a part of.

233
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,240
All faces of the same man.

234
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,440
One big self.

235
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,240
Everyone lookingfor salvation by himself.

236
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,040
Each like a coal

237
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,120
drawn from the fiire.

238
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,560
We're going straight up that hill there.

239
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:42,000
- We can't do that, Colonel.
- Well, there's no way to outflank it.

240
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,880
On the left is a cliff
that falls down into the river.

241
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,600
The Japanese hold the jungle.
It has to be taken frontally.

242
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,520
What about water, sir?
It's not getting up here.

243
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,920
My men are... passing out, sir.

244
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,120
Only time you worry about a soldier
is when he stops bitching.

245
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,920
We're all gonna attack abreast.
Third Platoon in reserve.

246
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,240
We've gotta cross
those three folds of ground. You see?

247
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,000
Once we get beyond that,
we gotta attackthat hill.

248
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:46,160
Colonel says there's no way to outflank it,
so we gotta take it head-on by frontal assault.

249
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,240
- Whyte?
- Yeah?

250
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,200
- See the grassy ridges at the foot of that hill?
- Yeah.

251
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:57,080
When you get to the end of that field,
eliminate all strongpoints on those ridges.

252
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:05,000
I'm sure the Japs got something there
to protect the approaches.

253
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,080
Are you here?

254
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,800
Let me not betray you.

255
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,360
Let me not betray my men.

256
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,920
In you I place my trust.

257
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,280
Rosy-fingered dawn.

258
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,040
You're Greek, aren'tyou, Captain?

259
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,120
D'you ever read Homer?

260
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,640
We read Homer at the Point.

261
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,520
In Greek.

262
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,960
What kind of artillery support
do we have, sir? Over.

263
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:04,440
- Two batteries of 105s.
- They won't make a dent. Over.

264
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,720
No, but it bucks the men up.
It'll look like the Japs are catching hell.

265
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,160
OK, you guys.

266
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,840
This is it.

267
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,320
We're going down in groups of ten.

268
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,920
There's no point in going by rushes.
Only make a better target stopped, so...

269
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,240
run all the way.

270
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,520
We ain't got no choice.
We're picked, so we gotta go.

271
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,720
I'm gonna take the first bunch myself.

272
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,040
I want Charlie Dale with me. Dale?

273
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,720
You go organise them guys that's up there.

274
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,400
Moving out in five minutes.

275
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,800
Let's go.

276
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,640
Sico?

277
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,240
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm sickto my stomach.

278
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,520
Sico, you get up now,
or I'll kick you so hard you're gonna be sick.

279
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,320
I can't. I would if I could.

280
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,640
I'm sick.

281
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,520
I'm sick.

282
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,600
You ain't sick. Get up!

283
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,000
- What's the matter, Sico?
- I don't know, Sergeant.

284
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,120
It's my stomach. I'm in pain, I got cramps.

285
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,360
I can't even sit up straight. I'm sick.

286
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,000
- Come on, get up!
- Leave him.

287
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:21,160
I need a volunteer to carry the BAR!
Drop your gear. I'm taking you to the medics.

288
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,240
Thank you, Sergeant.

289
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,440
Don't argue with me.

290
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,520
Good luck, Keck.

291
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,280
Plug that hole on your right!

292
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,160
Move!

293
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,040
Maybe they pulled out.

294
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,960
Hit dirt!

295
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,200
Hit dirt!

296
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,720
Calm down, calm down,
calm down, calm down.

297
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,280
Stretcher-bearers!

298
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,920
Come on!

299
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Stretcher-bearers, this way!

300
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,120
- Go get that man.
- We already got eight or nine down there...

301
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,080
- Don't argue with me! Get that man!
- He's not the one we should think about...

302
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:48,320
Goddamn it, all of you!
Am I in command here or am I not?!

303
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,320
- Am I the captain or a goddamn private?
- Others are hit bad. That's all I meant.

304
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,240
- I gave you an order, private!
- Yes, sir!

305
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,480
Hello, First Sergeant.

306
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,480
Who we going after over here?

307
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,240
We think it's Jacques.

308
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,360
OI' Jockey.

309
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,040
Well, shit. That's, that's, that's too bad.

310
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,880
Sir?

311
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:19,600
Sir? Sir, can I come backto the company
after we get Jockey backto the battalion?

312
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,320
- OK, butyou gotta get permission.
- Sure. And my rifle.

313
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,560
Nicky! You're still alive!

314
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,240
Keep moving! Keep moving!

315
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:39,040
Magnificent, Staros, magnificent. The finest
thing these old eyes have seen in a long time!

316
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:43,440
Beautifully conceived and executed!
You'll be mentioned in battalion orders.

317
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,960
Young Whyte led beautifully.

318
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,040
Yes, sir. Over.

319
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,880
But sending in your second too was brilliant.

320
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:56,240
They may have carried the ridge. I don't think
they were hurt too bad. Blane led well, too.

321
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,000
Now, how many emplacements
did they locate?

322
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,080
Did they knock any out?

323
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:05,040
We ought to have those ridges
cleaned out by noon! Over.

324
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,280
Hello! Hello! Staros, are you there?

325
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,520
Here, sir. Over.

326
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:16,280
I said, how many emplacements did they
locate? Did they knock any out? Over.

327
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,640
Children.

328
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,440
I don't know, sir.

329
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,840
What the hell do you mean, you don't know?
How can you not know? Over.

330
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:30,080
I'm right here behind the first swell, sir.
I'm right here behind the swell.

331
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,400
You want me to stand up and wave? Over.

332
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,560
No, I can see where you are.
I wantyou to do something.

333
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,720
I wantyou to get up there
and see what the situation is.

334
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,960
I want Hill 210 in my hands tonight.

335
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,240
Now, goddamn it,
the Admiral got up at dawn for this!

336
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,680
Come to life up there, Staros. Out!

337
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,960
Move up!

338
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,960
Hey, Keck!

339
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,920
Yeah!

340
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,040
- We gotta get out of here.
- I know it.

341
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,800
Blane's dead.

342
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,880
You're in charge.

343
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,720
We know you there, Yank!

344
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,480
Tojo eats shit!

345
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,680
No! Roosevelt eats shit!

346
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,760
I got him! I got him!

347
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,960
I killed a man.

348
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,040
Hey, Queen!

349
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,520
Queen, you there?

350
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:59,480
Worst thing you can do.
Worse than rape.

351
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,400
Queen! You see them Japs
leaving that left ridge?

352
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,160
- I killed a man. Nobody can touch me for it.
- I ain't seen nothing.

353
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,160
Well, getyour fuckin' head up
and look around!

354
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,560
I'm serious!

355
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,400
I counted seven Japs
leaving that left-hand grassy ridge!

356
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,880
I got me one of'em.

357
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,160
So?

358
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,400
I think maybe they're pulling out.

359
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,880
Maybe somebody
ought to go tell the captain.

360
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,440
You wanna be the one to do it?

361
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,560
You just stay put! I'm ordering you!

362
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,120
Down!

363
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,440
Stay low.

364
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,920
Go! Go!

365
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,120
Go! Go!



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
