1
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:57,090
片名: 红色警戒


2
00:01:57,873 --> 00:02:00,751
世上为何有这么多战争?
What's this war in the heart of nature?

3
00:02:03,921 --> 00:02:06,841
万物为何自相残杀?
Why does nature vie with itself?

4
00:02:08,134 --> 00:02:10,636
陆地和海洋为何互相对抗?
The land contend with the sea?

5
00:02:22,064 --> 00:02:24,775
大自然是否充满仇恨?
Is there an avenging power in nature?

6
00:02:27,862 --> 00:02:30,156
善恶是否同时存在?
Not one power, but two?

7
00:04:21,976 --> 00:04:24,520
我记得我母亲临终前
I remember my mother when she was dying.

8
00:04:25,646 --> 00:04:27,940
脸色苍白 形如槁木
Looked all shrunk up and grey.

9
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:34,405
我问她害不害怕?
I asked her if she was afraid.

10
00:04:35,906 --> 00:04:38,200
她只是摇摇头
She just shook her head.

11
00:04:39,618 --> 00:04:42,413
我不敢面对她的死亡
I was afraid to touch the death seen in her.

12
00:04:43,873 --> 00:04:49,169
也不觉得她蒙主荣召是一件好事
I couldn't find nothing beautiful or up lifting about her going back to God.

13
00:04:52,298 --> 00:04:56,608
听说精神能永垂不朽 不过我没见过
I heard people talk about immortality, but I ain't seen it.

14
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,498
不知道我死时会怎样
I wondered how it'd be when I died.

15
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:14,546
当你知道那是最后一口气不知道是什么感觉
What it'd be like to know that this breath now was the last one you was ever gonna draw.

16
00:06:18,884 --> 00:06:22,012
我希望能和她一样坦然面对
I just hope I can meet it the same way she did.

17
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,808
跟她一样...平静
With the same... calm.

18
00:06:28,811 --> 00:06:33,482
当心灵得到平静精神就能永垂不朽
Cos that's where it's hidden - the immortality I hadn't seen.

19
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,234
这里的小孩不会打架
Kids around here never fight.

20
00:07:17,776 --> 00:07:19,778
有时候会
Sometimes.

21
00:07:19,862 --> 00:07:22,865
他们在玩耍的时候
Sometimes when you see them playing

22
00:07:22,948 --> 00:07:25,117
总是会打架
they always fight!

23
00:07:29,037 --> 00:07:31,582
他怕我吗? - 有一点
Is she afraid of me? - Little bit.

24
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:36,336
- 你怕我吗?  怕
Are you afraid of me? - Yes.

25
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,548
为什么? - 因为你看起来...
Why? - Cos you look...

26
00:07:41,049 --> 00:07:42,968
...像是个军人
You look as an army!

27
00:07:43,051 --> 00:07:45,137
我像军人?  对
I look army?  Yes.

28
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:48,974
无所谓
Well, that don't matter.

29
00:07:50,684 --> 00:07:52,770
这不重要
It doesn't matter.

30
00:07:56,231 --> 00:07:58,317
孩子累了  对
Baby's tired.  Yes.

31
00:07:59,777 --> 00:08:02,362
他游累了就会睡
If she swims, she wants, she will sleep.

32
00:08:32,101 --> 00:08:34,269
好 来
All right, come on. Turn around.

33
00:08:34,353 --> 00:08:36,438
快...快...快
Go, go, go, go. Go!

34
00:08:37,272 --> 00:08:39,358
快点...快点...
Come on, go.

35
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:45,364
快 快 快
Go, go, go, go!

36
00:10:22,628 --> 00:10:27,049
威特 是美军的巡逻艇
Witt, patrol boat!She's American.

37
00:10:37,768 --> 00:10:40,020
它怎么会单独出现?
What's it doing out here all alone?

38
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,841
威特 你一点都没变
You haven't changed at all, have you, Witt?

39
00:11:09,925 --> 00:11:12,219
什么也没学到
You haven't learned a thing.

40
00:11:14,054 --> 00:11:18,558
当别人信任你你就肯为他赴汤蹈火
All a man has to do is leave it to you, you'll put your head in the noose for him.

41
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,025
你逃过几年兵?
How many times you been AWOL?

42
00:11:30,112 --> 00:11:32,739
你当兵六年了
Been in the army, what? Six years now?

43
00:11:32,823 --> 00:11:36,827
如果要学聪明
Ain't it time you smartened up and stopped being such a punk recruit?

44
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,996
现在该是时候了
I mean, if you're ever gonna.

45
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:41,164
我们不能都当聪明人
We can't all be smart.

46
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:45,252
没错 真可惜
No, we can't, and that's a shame.

47
00:11:45,335 --> 00:11:47,421
看看你
Look at you.

48
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:56,388
你在我的连队不能乖乖服役
Truth is, you can't take straight duty in my company.

49
00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:01,351
你在这世上不能成为 一个好的军人
You'll never be a real soldier, not in God's world.

50
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:07,733
这是C连 我是副连长
This is C Company, of which I'm First Sergeant. I run this outfit.

51
00:12:07,816 --> 00:12:12,654
史塔洛上尉是连长 这里是我话事 任何人都不可以违抗
Captain Staros, he's the CO, but I'm the guy who runs it. Nobody's gonna foul that up.

52
00:12:13,947 --> 00:12:16,575
你只是一张吃饭的嘴
You're just another mouth for me to feed.

53
00:12:19,244 --> 00:12:21,955
你本来要接受军事审判
Normally, you'd be courtmartialled.

54
00:12:22,456 --> 00:12:24,541
算你好运
But I worked a deal for ya.

55
00:12:24,624 --> 00:12:26,710
我给你另作安排
Gotta consider yourself lucky.

56
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:32,007
我派你到纪律部队
I'm sending you to a disciplinary outfit.

57
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:36,511
当担架兵 照顾伤兵
You'll be a stretcherbearer. You'll be taking care of the wounded.

58
00:12:37,804 --> 00:12:40,807
我能接受任何处罚
I can take anything you dish out.

59
00:12:40,891 --> 00:12:43,226
我一个人就比你好两倍
I'm twice the man you are.

60
00:12:54,696 --> 00:12:56,782
在这个世界里
In this world...

61
00:12:57,699 --> 00:13:01,536
一个人根本微不足道
a man himself is nothing.

62
00:13:05,207 --> 00:13:09,252
只有这一个世界
And there ain't no world but this one.

63
00:13:11,963 --> 00:13:14,049
你错了 副连长
You're wrong there, Top.

64
00:13:16,843 --> 00:13:18,929
我见过另一个世界
I seen another world.

65
00:13:24,518 --> 00:13:28,396
有时候我觉得这只是我的想像
Sometimes I think it was just... my imagination.

66
00:13:30,816 --> 00:13:32,901
好
Well,

67
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,695
我和你的看法不同
then you've seen things I never will.

68
00:13:45,414 --> 00:13:50,877
这个世界在自我毁灭
We're living in a world that's blowing itself to hell as fast as everybody can arrange it.

69
00:13:51,837 --> 00:13:56,800
你只以只眼开只眼闭
In a situation like that all a man can do is shut his eyes and let nothing touch him.

70
00:13:56,883 --> 00:13:58,969
为自己着想
Look out for himself.

71
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:13,942
我可能是你最好的朋友
I might be the best friend you ever had.

72
00:14:16,153 --> 00:14:18,238
你自己都不知道
You don't even know it.

73
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:52,105
他憎死你了
He hates you worse than poison.

74
00:14:56,902 --> 00:15:00,363
我不觉得他憎我 因为我不憎他
I never felt he hated me, cos I don't hate him.

75
00:15:41,321 --> 00:15:43,406
我爱C队的兄弟
I love Charlie Company.

76
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,455
他们是我的家人
They're my people.

77
00:16:15,355 --> 00:16:17,232
这个岛叫"顽石"
They call it "The Rock".

78
00:16:17,315 --> 00:16:20,569
原本无人占领 后来让日军盖了机场
Nobody wants this island. Japs just put an airfield there.

79
00:16:20,652 --> 00:16:22,529
主要战区在这里
Fighting's confined to this area.

80
00:16:22,612 --> 00:16:28,201
这是攻击澳洲的途径亦是进攻美国的海道
This is their road to Australia, and this is their way of controlling the sea lanes to America.

81
00:16:28,285 --> 00:16:33,498
若要阻止日军攻占南太平洋 就得在这里开战
If we're gonna stop the Japs' advance into the South Pacific, we've gotta do it right there.

82
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,086
海军陆战队已经试过 现在轮到我们
The Marines have done their job. Now it's our turn.

83
00:16:39,546 --> 00:16:41,631
我们将奋不顾身
Worked my ass off.

84
00:16:43,174 --> 00:16:45,260
尽量迎合将军
Brownnosed the generals.

85
00:16:47,512 --> 00:16:49,598
降低身份
Degraded myself

86
00:16:51,474 --> 00:16:54,644
为他们 为我家人
for them and my family.

87
00:16:55,937 --> 00:16:58,023
和我的家
For my home.

88
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,985
我很敬佩你 上校  谢谢你 长官
I admire you, Colonel. I do.  Thank you, sir.

89
00:17:02,068 --> 00:17:05,030
你这年纪的军官早已退休了
Most men your age would have retired by now.

90
00:17:05,113 --> 00:17:07,198
你是好军人
It's OK.

91
00:17:07,907 --> 00:17:11,911
部队需要你这种成熟的长官
We need general officers with maturity and character like you.

92
00:17:11,995 --> 00:17:15,373
我们有好的中士和中校
We've got good sergeants and good lieutenant colonels.

93
00:17:15,457 --> 00:17:18,835
他们一当了上校 就想做将军
But once a man gets those eagles, he can't wait to get that star.

94
00:17:18,918 --> 00:17:21,004
于是成为政客
He becomes a politician, right?

95
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:23,173
只会拍上司的马屁
Goes along to get along.

96
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:27,886
很难坚持原则
So goddamn hard to stay upright.

97
00:17:27,969 --> 00:17:32,015
你说得对 长官  上将会注意我的表现
You said it there, sir.  With the Admiral watching, which he will be.

98
00:17:32,098 --> 00:17:35,018
一定有人盯着你  嗯
There's always someone watching.  Yeah.

99
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,063
像只猎鹰
Like a hawk.

100
00:17:38,146 --> 00:17:41,316
总是有人想抢你的功劳
Always someone ready to jump in, if you're not.

101
00:17:53,662 --> 00:17:55,747
你有儿子吗 上校?  有的 长官
D'you have a son, Colonel?  Yes, sir.

102
00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:00,251
很好 不能让子孙打这场烂仗
Good. We don't want our sons or grandsons fighting this war 30 years from now, do we?

103
00:18:00,335 --> 00:18:03,880
没错 是不能  那就全力攻敌
No, sir, we sure don't.  Then you crush 'em without mercy.

104
00:18:03,963 --> 00:18:07,008
把敌人赶尽杀绝 抢下机场
You dig them out of the hills and protect that airfield.

105
00:18:07,092 --> 00:18:08,968
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

106
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:15,225
你有没有想过日军为何在这儿盖机场?
You wonder why... Why did the Japs put an airfield there of all places?

107
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:19,396
我们对大局不太清楚
I guess we don't know the bigger picture, if there is such a thing.

108
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:23,566
你认为呢?  我从不想这种问题
What do you think?  Well, sir, I never ask myself that question.

109
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,318
你很谦虚
You're a humble man.

110
00:18:27,445 --> 00:18:30,657
没人要这座岛...除了你
Nobody wants that island... but you.

111
00:18:31,908 --> 00:18:34,244
你有多大的决心?
How much do you want it?

112
00:18:34,327 --> 00:18:36,746
我会全力以赴
As much as I have to, sir.

113
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,669
家人为我做的牺牲
All they sacrificed for me

114
00:18:45,714 --> 00:18:48,466
就像覆水难收
poured out like water on the ground.

115
00:18:54,264 --> 00:18:57,183
我本来能好好爱他们
All I might have given for love's sake.

116
00:19:11,698 --> 00:19:13,783
太迟了
Too late.

117
00:19:18,621 --> 00:19:20,707
我的心已死
Died...

118
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,210
像树木一样慢慢凋零
slow as a tree.

119
00:19:26,463 --> 00:19:28,548
你感觉得到吗?
D'you feel it?

120
00:19:29,257 --> 00:19:31,342
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

121
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:37,557
谢谢你 长官
Thank you, sir.

122
00:19:59,287 --> 00:20:02,540
权力越大 恐惧越深
The closer you are to Caesar, the greater the fear.

123
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,852
我就是感到害怕
I just can't help how damn scared I am, sarge, all right?

124
00:20:23,895 --> 00:20:25,563
无法控制
I can't help it. I got...

125
00:20:25,647 --> 00:20:29,025
小时候我继父常用砖块打我
My stepdaddy took a block and beat me when I was real little

126
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:31,903
我好怕 老是躲起来
and I was scared and I used to run, I used to hide.

127
00:20:31,986 --> 00:20:35,657
时常睡在鸡窝
Hell, I slept in the chicken coop a whole lot of nights.

128
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:39,911
我以为我不会再害怕
And I never thought it'd get no worse than that.

129
00:20:41,204 --> 00:20:45,041
但是现在我分秒都在害怕
But I'm living by the... by the minute here. I'm counting the seconds.

130
00:20:45,124 --> 00:20:49,587
马上就要登陆一定会遭到空袭
Hell, we're gonna be landing soon and there's gonna be air raids.

131
00:20:49,671 --> 00:20:53,132
我们会阵亡在滩头
We're probably gonna die before we get off the beach.

132
00:20:53,216 --> 00:20:57,220
这艘船就像漂流的坟墓
This place is... It's like a big floating graveyard.

133
00:20:57,303 --> 00:21:01,516
你叫什么 小子?  我退伍后想买一辆车
What's your name, kid?  I wanna own an automobile when I get out.

134
00:21:02,976 --> 00:21:05,770
你叫什么?  爱德华崔恩
What's your name?  Edward, Edward B Train.

135
00:21:05,853 --> 00:21:06,938
崔恩?
Train?

136
00:21:07,021 --> 00:21:12,443
只有上帝和死亡是永恒的
The only things that are permanent is, is dying and the Lord. That's it.

137
00:21:12,527 --> 00:21:18,449
我只担心这些 这场战争不是你我的终点
That's all you gotta worry about. This war ain't... gonna be the end of me or you neither.

138
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:21,869
会遇到空袭吗?  我怎么知道?
Think we'll catch an air raid?  How in the hell should I know?

139
00:21:21,953 --> 00:21:26,708
别的大兵说上次进攻就没有
All's I know are them crew guys said they didn't catch no air raid the last time.

140
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:30,378
上上一次他们差点被炸死
On the other hand, time before last they nearly got blew up.

141
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:32,338
你要我怎么说
What d'you want me to tell you?

142
00:21:32,422 --> 00:21:35,466
多谢了 你什么也没说
You're a big help, Tills. Nothing. Tell me nothing.

143
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,010
不过我要告诉你
Tell you something.

144
00:21:37,093 --> 00:21:41,681
我们在船上就像是死鸭子
We're sitting out here on this ocean like a couple of fuckin' ducks in these boats.

145
00:21:41,764 --> 00:21:43,725
我早就知道
I already know that.

146
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,560
好好想一想 提奥
Well, brood on it, Tills.

147
00:21:45,643 --> 00:21:47,937
好好地想
Brood on it.

148
00:21:48,021 --> 00:21:51,441
不看好戏吗?  没兴趣
Ain't you watching the fun?  I ain't interested.

149
00:21:51,524 --> 00:21:55,987
太迫了  就算不迫我也不想看
Yeah, I guess it is pretty crowded.  Wouldn't be interested, even if it wasn't.

150
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,865
我要去拿那把手枪
Well, I'm on my way to get me that pistol.

151
00:21:58,948 --> 00:22:00,617
是吗? 开心点
Yeah? Well, have fun.

152
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,910
是啊 开心点
Yeah, have fun.

153
00:22:02,994 --> 00:22:07,832
有手枪才能对付日本武士刀
You'll wish you had one once we get ashore and run into some of them samurai sabres.

154
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:11,544
快开门 给我开门...
Open this door! Open this goddamn door!

155
00:22:11,628 --> 00:22:13,504
快开门
Open the door!

156
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:39,113
我入伍时没想到会有这下场
I never bargained for nothing like this when I signed up for this man's army before the war.

157
00:22:39,197 --> 00:22:43,993
我怎么知道会打仗? 你倒是说说
How was I supposed to know there was gonna be a fuckin' war, huh? Answer me that.

158
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,958
我只知道C连最衰了
All I know is Charlie Company's always getting screwed. Always.

159
00:22:51,042 --> 00:22:53,795
我也知道是谁的错
And I can tell you whose fault it is, too.

160
00:22:53,878 --> 00:22:55,838
就是我们的连长
It's that captain of ours.

161
00:22:55,922 --> 00:23:00,718
他害大家被派上这艘鬼船
First he gets us stuck off on this boat where we don't know a fucking soul.

162
00:23:00,802 --> 00:23:06,265
而且是第四批登陆部队
Then he gets us stuck way down in fourth place on the list to get off this son of a bitch.

163
00:23:19,946 --> 00:23:22,031
连长 你好
Hello, Captain.

164
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:09,746
档案说你在战前是军官
I read in your 201 file that you were an officer before the war.

165
00:24:10,329 --> 00:24:12,498
怎么会变成二等兵?
How'd you end up a private?

166
00:24:12,582 --> 00:24:14,667
因为我太太
Cos of my wife.

167
00:24:15,418 --> 00:24:17,628
我本来在工兵部队
I was in the corps of engineers.

168
00:24:18,921 --> 00:24:21,883
我和她从来没分开过
We'd never been separated before,

169
00:24:21,966 --> 00:24:24,052
连一晚都没有
not even for a night.

170
00:24:24,927 --> 00:24:28,890
我忍受了四个月最后终于放弃
I took it for four months and then I quit.

171
00:24:30,808 --> 00:24:32,894
辞职不干
Just resigned.

172
00:24:33,853 --> 00:24:36,606
我被送回美国
They sent me back to the States.

173
00:24:36,689 --> 00:24:39,776
永远不能当军官
They told me I'd never get another commission.

174
00:24:39,859 --> 00:24:45,531
他们说要徵召我入伍让我当步兵
They said they'd see to it I got drafted and that I for damn sure'd be in the infantry.

175
00:24:46,157 --> 00:24:48,242
那些浑蛋
Sons of bitches.

176
00:24:48,868 --> 00:24:50,953
我不怪他们
No, I don't blame them.

177
00:24:53,206 --> 00:24:55,458
她在哪里?
Well, where is she now?

178
00:24:56,334 --> 00:24:58,419
在家里
She's home.

179
00:25:11,641 --> 00:25:14,227
我并不怕死
Why should i be afraid to die?

180
00:25:16,854 --> 00:25:18,314
因为我已属于你
I belong to you.

181
00:25:20,566 --> 00:25:23,402
快...快...快...
Move! Move! Move!

182
00:25:23,486 --> 00:25:25,571
快 快
Move! Move!

183
00:25:32,703 --> 00:25:33,955
快点...
Move! Move!

184
00:25:34,038 --> 00:25:35,289
快 快
Moving out!

185
00:25:35,373 --> 00:25:39,544
如果我先走 我会等你的
If i go first, I'll wait for you there.

186
00:25:40,878 --> 00:25:43,297
就在死亡的另一边
On the otherside of the dark waters.

187
00:25:50,596 --> 00:25:52,682
贝尔 戴上头盔
Put your helmet on.

188
00:25:53,808 --> 00:25:55,893
你与我同在
Be with me now.

189
00:26:05,945 --> 00:26:08,447
压力很大 对吧?  是的 长官
Feeling the pressure, Captain?  Yes, sir.

190
00:26:10,241 --> 00:26:12,118
我喜欢你 上尉
I like you, Captain.

191
00:26:12,201 --> 00:26:17,707
我要你知道我很支持你
And I just want you to know, well, we're in this thing together. All right?

192
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:21,878
你先逼近敌区 我会赶上来
Keep pressing inland till you reach the line. I'll catch up with you there.

193
00:26:21,961 --> 00:26:23,838
是的 长官  由你全权指挥
Yes, sir.  It's all yours, Captain.

194
00:26:23,921 --> 00:26:26,382
让开 让开
Gangway! Gangway there!

195
00:26:26,465 --> 00:26:27,925
我要过去
Coming through!

196
00:26:28,009 --> 00:26:30,928
班长马上报到
Squad leaders! Both teams!

197
00:26:31,012 --> 00:26:33,347
在这里
This way, son. This way, right here.

198
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,475
准备上登陆船
Stand by to go over the side!

199
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,286
我们在天上的父
Our Father, who art in heaven...

200
00:27:52,287 --> 00:27:56,166
免我们的债如同我们免人的债
And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.

201
00:27:56,249 --> 00:27:59,878
国度权柄荣耀全是您的 阿们
For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory.

202
00:28:12,766 --> 00:28:14,642
你们很幸运
Your outfit's lucky.

203
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,811
运输船刚被日军发现
Transports must've been spotted.

204
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:19,814
幸好你们下来了
You're getting outta here just ahead of time.

205
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,702
深呼吸 你得深呼吸
Take a breath, mister. You gotta breathe!

206
00:29:02,857 --> 00:29:04,526
这是C连吗?  是的
You Charlie Company?  Yeah.

207
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,694
我们深入内陆一英里 什么也没有
We went in a mile. Nothing there.

208
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:09,322
一个礼拜都没动静
Some oil drums. There'd be nothing there for...

209
00:29:09,405 --> 00:29:10,782
一个礼拜  一个礼拜 长官
A week.  A week, sir.

210
00:29:10,865 --> 00:29:13,326
无人伤亡 日军大概都跑了
No casualties. Japs must've hauled ass.

211
00:29:13,409 --> 00:29:16,454
我们受迫击炮攻击 无人伤亡
Two mortars hit the beach, but most guys came in standing up.

212
00:29:16,538 --> 00:29:18,414
这地方很不可思议
Darnedest thing I ever did see.

213
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:23,461
还有鱼住在树上
They got fish that live in trees.

214
00:29:27,048 --> 00:29:31,636
指挥部好像没搞清楚状况
If they didn't know this beach was deserted, what else don't they know?

215
00:31:03,102 --> 00:31:06,648
您化身为宇宙万物
Who are you to live in all these many forms?

216
00:31:38,638 --> 00:31:41,140
万物皆难逃一死
Your death that captures all.

217
00:31:47,522 --> 00:31:51,484
您也是生命的泉源
You, too, are the source of all that's gonna be born.

218
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:17,719
您充满荣耀
Your glory.

219
00:32:21,014 --> 00:32:23,099
慈悲
Mercy.

220
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:26,728
宁静
Peace.

221
00:32:28,688 --> 00:32:30,773
真理
Truth.

222
00:32:37,405 --> 00:32:39,699
您能安抚人心
You give calm a spirit,

223
00:32:42,744 --> 00:32:44,829
给人们谅解
understanding,

224
00:32:46,622 --> 00:32:48,708
和勇气
courage.

225
00:32:53,379 --> 00:32:55,465
使人得到满足
The contented heart.

226
00:36:35,768 --> 00:36:37,853
医务兵 这里
Get a medic here!

227
00:36:43,109 --> 00:36:47,655
也许每个人都有共同的灵魂 和相同的命运
Maybe all men got one big soul who everybody's a part of.

228
00:36:50,366 --> 00:36:52,868
每张脸孔都是同一个人
All faces of the same man.

229
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,205
一个大我
One big self.

230
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:33,534
每个人都想获得救赎
Everyone looking for salvation by himself.

231
00:37:40,374 --> 00:37:44,879
像炭火般燃烧生命
Each like a coal drawn from the fire.

232
00:38:16,911 --> 00:38:19,747
我们要攻上那座山头
We're going straight up that hill there.

233
00:38:23,376 --> 00:38:27,505
办不到 上校  我们无法包抄敌军
We can't do that, Colonel.  Well, there's no way to outflank it.

234
00:38:27,588 --> 00:38:30,508
左边的悬崖底下是河流
On the left is a cliff that falls down into the river.

235
00:38:30,591 --> 00:38:34,387
日军守住丛林 我们得正面突袭
The Japanese hold the jungle. It has to be taken frontally.

236
00:38:36,597 --> 00:38:39,517
食水怎么办? 山上没清水
What about water, sir? It's not getting up here.

237
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,019
我的兄弟都因为脱水昏倒
My men are... passing out, sir.

238
00:38:49,335 --> 00:38:53,698
他们能发牢骚就能打仗
Only time you worry about a soldier is when he stops bitching.

239
00:39:07,128 --> 00:39:11,215
并肩前进 第三排留守
We're all gonna attack abreast. Third Platoon in reserve.

240
00:39:11,298 --> 00:39:14,677
我们得越过三个山丘
We've gotta cross those three folds of ground. You see?

241
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,555
然后再攻下山头
Once we get beyond that, we gotta attack that hill.

242
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:34,405
上校说不能采取包抄攻势 我们得正面突袭
Colonel says there's no way to outflank it, so we gotta take it headon by frontal assault.

243
00:39:36,157 --> 00:39:37,616
伟特  是
Whyte?  Yeah?

244
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,703
看到山坡前面吗?  看到了
See the grassy ridges at the foot of that hill?  Yeah.

245
00:39:40,786 --> 00:39:45,791
等你攻上山坡 找到敌军据点然后消灭他们
When you get to the end of that field, eliminate all strong points on those ridges.

246
00:39:49,962 --> 00:39:54,091
那儿一定有敌军守住
I'm sure the Japs got something there to protect the approaches.

247
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,285
主啊 您在吗?
Are you here?

248
00:41:03,591 --> 00:41:05,677
别让我背叛您
Let me not betray you.

249
00:41:09,389 --> 00:41:11,474
别让我背叛我的兄弟
Let me not betray my men.

250
00:41:19,148 --> 00:41:21,442
您让我充满信心 和希望
In you I place my trust.

251
00:41:33,488 --> 00:41:36,547
(希腊语)


252
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:39,544
玫瑰般的黎明
Rosyfingered dawn.

253
00:41:41,045 --> 00:41:43,464
你是希腊人
You're Greek, aren't you, Captain?

254
00:41:43,548 --> 00:41:45,633
读过荷马的史诗吗?
D'you ever read Homer?

255
00:41:45,717 --> 00:41:50,221
我在西点军校读过希腊原文
We read Homer at the Point.In Greek.

256
00:41:50,304 --> 00:41:53,808
有多少炮兵支援火力?
What kind of artillery support do we have, sir? Over.

257
00:41:53,891 --> 00:41:58,479
两组105榴弹炮  一点都没有用
Two batteries of 105s.  They won't make a dent. Over.

258
00:41:58,563 --> 00:42:02,942
不过能提高士气 日军会被炸得很难看
No, but it bucks the men up. It'll look like the Japs are catching hell.

259
00:42:56,787 --> 00:42:58,664
兄弟们
OK, you guys.

260
00:42:58,748 --> 00:43:00,416
准备上吧
This is it.

261
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,002
每组十人攻上山头
We're going down in groups often.

262
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:08,883
快速前进才不会成为目标
There's no point in going by rushes. Only make a better target stopped, so...

263
00:43:08,966 --> 00:43:11,302
一路跑上去
run all the way.

264
00:43:11,385 --> 00:43:14,722
我们被选上 别无选择 非去不可
We ain't got no choice. We're picked, so we gotta go.

265
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:20,144
我亲自带领先锋队
I'm gonna take the first bunch myself.

266
00:43:20,228 --> 00:43:22,563
我要戴尔跟着我 戴尔?
I want Charlie Dale with me. Dale?

267
00:43:22,647 --> 00:43:25,358
叫兄弟在山坡集合
You go organise them guys that's up there.

268
00:43:31,072 --> 00:43:33,366
五分钟后出发
Moving out in five minutes.

269
00:43:34,242 --> 00:43:35,868
走吧
Let's go.

270
00:43:40,081 --> 00:43:41,958
施高?
Sico?

271
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:45,711
你怎么了?  我的肚子好痛
What's wrong with you?  I'm sick to my stomach.

272
00:43:45,795 --> 00:43:49,131
起来 小心我踢扁你
Sico, you get up now, or I'll kick you so hard you're gonna be sick.

273
00:43:49,215 --> 00:43:51,008
我站不起来
I can't. I would if I could.

274
00:43:51,092 --> 00:43:53,427
我生病了
I'm sick.

275
00:43:53,511 --> 00:43:55,388
我病了
I'm sick.

276
00:43:55,471 --> 00:43:57,557
你没有病 起来
You ain't sick. Get up!

277
00:44:01,853 --> 00:44:05,273
施高 怎么了?  不晓得
What's the matter, Sico?  I don't know, Sergeant.

278
00:44:05,356 --> 00:44:08,526
肚子好痛 好像是胃痉孪
It's my stomach. I'm in pain, I got cramps.

279
00:44:08,609 --> 00:44:10,862
我病了 坐不起来
I can't even sit up straight. I'm sick.

280
00:44:14,865 --> 00:44:16,742
给我起来!  别逼他了
Come on, get up!  Leave him.

281
00:44:16,826 --> 00:44:21,080
谁要替我拿步枪? 我带你找医官
I need a volunteer to carry the BAR! Drop your gear. I'm taking you to the medics.

282
00:44:21,163 --> 00:44:23,249
谢谢你 副连长
Thank you, Sergeant.

283
00:44:25,543 --> 00:44:27,628
别跟我争
Don't argue with me.

284
00:44:27,712 --> 00:44:29,797
祝好运 杰克
Good luck, Keck.

285
00:45:56,684 --> 00:45:58,770
也许他们撤退了
Maybe they pulled out.

286
00:48:09,525 --> 00:48:11,152
快趴下!
Hit dirt!

287
00:48:11,569 --> 00:48:13,487
趴下来!
Hit dirt!

288
00:48:18,576 --> 00:48:21,329
冷静点...冷静点...
Calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down.

289
00:48:26,125 --> 00:48:28,169
担架兵
Stretcherbearers!

290
00:48:43,851 --> 00:48:45,519
这儿
Come on!

291
00:48:45,603 --> 00:48:47,688
担架兵 在这儿
Stretcherbearers, this way!

292
00:48:48,773 --> 00:48:51,984
去救那兄弟  已经有八 九名伤兵...
Go get that man.  We already got eight or nine down there...

293
00:48:52,068 --> 00:48:56,113
别跟我争 我要救他  管不了他们了
Don't argue with me! Get that man!  He's not the one we should think about...

294
00:48:56,197 --> 00:48:59,492
该死 全都要救 我是指挥官
Goddamn it, all of you! Am I in command here or am I not?!

295
00:48:59,575 --> 00:49:03,663
难道你是连长吗?  我只是说别人伤得更重
Am I the captain or a goddamn private?  Others are hit bad. That's all I meant.

296
00:49:05,623 --> 00:49:07,750
二兵 听我的命令  是 长官!
I gave you an order, private!  Yes, sir!

297
00:49:10,503 --> 00:49:12,171
你好 副连长
Hello, First Sergeant.

298
00:49:13,923 --> 00:49:16,342
我们要救谁?
Who we going after over here?

299
00:49:17,134 --> 00:49:19,220
应该是积克
We think it's Jacques.

300
00:49:19,762 --> 00:49:21,430
积克老兄
Ol' Jockey.

301
00:49:21,514 --> 00:49:24,225
真是倒霉
Well, shit. That's, that's, that's too bad.

302
00:49:24,725 --> 00:49:26,185
长官?
Sir?

303
00:49:26,852 --> 00:49:32,149
把积克抬回去我能回来吗?
Sir? Sir, can I come back to the company after we get Jockey back to the battalion?

304
00:49:32,984 --> 00:49:37,071
好 你要得到许可  当然 我的步枪
OK, but you gotta get permission.  Sure. And my rifle.

305
00:49:40,116 --> 00:49:42,535
力奇 你还活着
Nicky! You're still alive!

306
00:49:43,452 --> 00:49:45,329
继续前进! 继续前进!
Keep moving! Keep moving!

307
00:49:46,414 --> 00:49:52,420
太好了 史塔奥 好久没见到这么猛烈的攻击
Magnificent, Staros, magnificent. The finest thing these old eyes have seen in a long time!

308
00:49:52,503 --> 00:49:57,008
你指挥得很好 我会请营长给你功勋
Beautifully conceived and executed! You'll be mentioned in battalion orders.

309
00:49:57,091 --> 00:49:59,635
伟特排长的表现也很棒
Young Whyte led beautifully.

310
00:49:59,719 --> 00:50:01,804
是 长官
Yes, sir. Over.

311
00:50:01,929 --> 00:50:04,765
派第二排增援也很聪明
But sending in your second too was brilliant.

312
00:50:04,849 --> 00:50:10,354
就快攻上去了 伤亡不惨重 布兰也不错
They may have carried the ridge. I don't think they were hurt too bad. Blane led well, too.

313
00:50:10,438 --> 00:50:13,232
他们发现多少据点?
Now, how many emplacements did they locate?

314
00:50:13,315 --> 00:50:15,401
消灭了多少?
Did they knock any out?

315
00:50:15,484 --> 00:50:19,530
中午就应该能攻上山头
We ought to have those ridges cleaned out by noon! Over.

316
00:50:21,657 --> 00:50:23,951
史塔奥 你在吗?
Hello! Hello! Staros, are you there?

317
00:50:24,035 --> 00:50:26,287
我在 长官
Here, sir. Over.

318
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:31,250
他们发现多少据点? 消灭了多少?
I said, how many emplacements did they locate? Did they knock any out? Over.

319
00:50:31,333 --> 00:50:33,711
孩子们
Children.

320
00:50:33,794 --> 00:50:36,630
我不知道
I don't know, sir.

321
00:50:36,714 --> 00:50:41,218
什么意思? 你怎么会不知道?
What the hell do you mean, you don't know? How can you not know? Over.

322
00:50:41,343 --> 00:50:45,639
我在第一座山丘后面
I'm right here behind the first swell, sir. I'm right here behind the swell.

323
00:50:45,723 --> 00:50:48,058
要我站起来招手吗?
You want me to stand up and wave? Over.

324
00:50:48,142 --> 00:50:51,353
我看到了 你得想办法
No, I can see where you are. I want you to do something.

325
00:50:51,437 --> 00:50:54,648
快上去看看情况如何
I want you to get up there and see what the situation is.

326
00:50:54,732 --> 00:50:56,984
今晚我就要你攻下山头
I want Hill 210 in my hands tonight.

327
00:50:57,068 --> 00:51:00,404
上将一早就要来查看
Now, goddamn it, the Admiral got up at dawn for this!

328
00:51:00,488 --> 00:51:02,948
提起精神来 史塔奥
Come to life up there, Staros. Out!

329
00:51:29,308 --> 00:51:31,393
上来
Move up!

330
00:51:49,745 --> 00:51:51,205
嘿 杰克!
Hey, Keck!

331
00:51:52,414 --> 00:51:54,291
干嘛?
Yeah?

332
00:51:54,667 --> 00:51:57,545
我们得撤退  我知道
We gotta get out of here.  I know it.

333
00:51:58,504 --> 00:52:00,422
布兰死了
Blane's dead.

334
00:52:00,506 --> 00:52:02,591
你得指挥
You're in charge.

335
00:52:05,553 --> 00:52:08,681
美国佬 我们看到你们
We know you there, Yank!

336
00:52:09,473 --> 00:52:11,559
东条英机去死
Tojo eats shit!

337
00:52:11,767 --> 00:52:14,895
罗斯福去死
No! Roosevelt eats shit!

338
00:52:50,681 --> 00:52:52,558
我打到他了 我打到他了
I got him! I got him!

339
00:53:10,492 --> 00:53:12,578
我杀死一个人
I killed a man.

340
00:53:12,661 --> 00:53:14,747
嘿 昆恩!
Hey, Queen!

341
00:53:15,456 --> 00:53:17,333
昆恩 你在吗?
Queen, you there?

342
00:53:17,416 --> 00:53:21,462
杀人比强奸更严重
Worst thing you can do. Worse than rape.

343
00:53:21,545 --> 00:53:24,506
看到日本鬼子离开左边吗?
Queen! You see them Japs leaving that left ridge?

344
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:28,427
没有人能把我怎样  我什么也没看到
I killed a man. Nobody can touch me for it.  I ain't seen nothing.

345
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:31,555
抬起头来看看
Well, get your fuckin' head up and look around!

346
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:35,100
我是说真的!
I'm serious!

347
00:53:35,184 --> 00:53:39,104
有七个日兵离开左边
I counted seven Japs leaving that lefthand grassy ridge!

348
00:53:39,605 --> 00:53:41,690
我打中一个
I got me one of 'em.

349
00:53:41,774 --> 00:53:43,025
又怎样?
So?

350
00:53:43,108 --> 00:53:45,361
他们可能会撤退
I think maybe they're pulling out.

351
00:53:48,697 --> 00:53:51,075
也许该去告诉连长
Maybe somebody ought to go tell the captain.

352
00:53:51,158 --> 00:53:52,701
你想去吗?
You wanna be the one to do it?

353
00:53:58,582 --> 00:54:01,168
我命令你别乱动
You just stay put! I'm ordering you!

354
00:54:24,274 --> 00:54:25,734
趴低
Down!

355
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:36,495
趴低点
Stay low.

356
00:55:03,063 --> 00:55:05,149
冲! 冲!
Go! Go!

357
00:55:05,357 --> 00:55:07,443
冲! 冲!
Go! Go!

358
00:55:48,275 --> 00:55:50,361
现在怎么办?
What do we do now?

359
00:55:50,444 --> 00:55:54,615
在这儿等 也许会有人来支援
We wait right here. Maybe they'll send us up some reinforcements.

360
00:55:54,698 --> 00:55:56,158
做什么?
To do what?

361
00:55:56,241 --> 00:55:59,286
攻下敌军的据点呀
To capture some of these fucking positions around here!

362
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:04,833
你要继续进攻?  不知道 不能直接进攻山头
You mean you really wanna go on with this?  Hell, no. No, not no uphill charge.

363
00:56:04,917 --> 00:56:08,587
不过如果有支援
If they send us reinforcements, maybe we could scout around

364
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:10,756
就能试着除掉机关枪
and locate these machine guns.

365
00:56:10,839 --> 00:56:14,843
总比冒死退回去好  有人来了
Anyway, it's better than going back down.  Something's coming!

366
00:56:14,927 --> 00:56:16,845
他们来了!
They're coming!

367
00:56:22,351 --> 00:56:23,602
他们在干什么?
What are they doin'?

368
00:56:23,685 --> 00:56:26,772
他们为什么不全力进攻?
If they want to throw us out, why didn't they come in force?

369
00:56:26,855 --> 00:56:29,066
也许他们落了单
Maybe they was acting on their own.

370
00:56:30,567 --> 00:56:33,070
也许他们想上西天
Maybe they wanted to get into nirvana.

371
00:56:34,571 --> 00:56:36,448
敌人来了
They're coming.

372
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,668
怎么回事?
Keck!

373
00:56:47,751 --> 00:56:49,169
天啊
Jesus!

374
00:56:49,253 --> 00:56:51,338
老天!
Oh, Jesus!

375
00:56:52,965 --> 00:56:54,591
我炸到屁股!
I blew my butt off!

376
00:56:54,675 --> 00:56:58,095
没事 没事  我把屁股炸掉了
It's all right. It's all right.  I blew my butt off!

377
00:56:58,178 --> 00:56:59,638
趴下来
Lay down!

378
00:56:59,721 --> 00:57:02,474
我怎么会这么衰?
What a fucking recruit trick to pull!

379
00:57:02,558 --> 00:57:05,561
我只拔到保险制  写信给我老婆
Take it easy. Take it easy.  I grabbed it by the pin!

380
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:10,691
告诉她我死得很光荣
You write my old lady. You tell her... I want her to know I died like a man.

381
00:57:10,774 --> 00:57:13,110
你不会死的 没人给她写 得你自己来
Nobody's gonna have to write her. You'll make it.

382
00:57:13,193 --> 00:57:15,070
别骗我  下来
Don't bullshit me!  Stay down!

383
00:57:15,154 --> 00:57:17,239
嘿 嘿
Hey, hey.

384
00:57:18,323 --> 00:57:20,117
我全身是泥
Have I got mud on my face?

385
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,286
帮我擦掉
Wipe it off. Get it off.

386
00:57:23,787 --> 00:57:25,873
不
No!

387
00:57:25,956 --> 00:57:28,041
我会写信给她
I'll write her. I promise.

388
00:57:31,261 --> 00:57:35,266
我的水壶还有水 拿去吧
Take my canteen. There's still some water in there.

389
00:57:40,062 --> 00:57:42,147
也许这样最好
It's for the best.

390
00:57:43,023 --> 00:57:45,317
我的下面被炸烂
I'm all messed up down there.

391
00:57:46,485 --> 00:57:48,570
不能搞了
I can't fuck no more.

392
00:57:50,948 --> 00:57:54,326
我在哪儿?
Whoa... Where am I?

393
00:57:55,786 --> 00:57:57,454
我在哪儿?
Where am I?

394
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:02,584
你不会有事
You're gonna be all right.

395
00:58:02,668 --> 00:58:06,797
就算你死了 你没有对不起兄弟
Even if you die, you didn't let your brother down.

396
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,593
要是你不扑上去 我们全都会死
If you hadn't thrown yourself against that embankment, we'd all have been killed.

397
00:58:11,677 --> 00:58:13,762
我好冷
I'm cold.

398
00:58:16,181 --> 00:58:18,350
我好冷
I'm cold.

399
00:58:19,601 --> 00:58:21,687
我快冻死了
I'm... freezing.

400
00:59:16,776 --> 00:59:18,861
你要写信给他老婆?
You gonna write his wife?

401
00:59:20,279 --> 00:59:22,156
才不要
Fuck, no.

402
00:59:22,573 --> 00:59:24,658
我又不认识她
I don't know his old lady.

403
00:59:25,242 --> 00:59:29,789
那是连长的事 别傻了 我不会写信
That's the company commander's job. You outta your mind? I ain't no good at writing.

404
00:59:29,872 --> 00:59:31,957
你答应过他
You told him you would.

405
00:59:32,041 --> 00:59:35,836
他快死了 我得那么说
I'll say anything to 'em when they're like that.

406
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:38,547
有人得写信给她
Somebody ought to do it.

407
00:59:38,631 --> 00:59:41,509
你写给她吧
Well, then, you write her. Yeah, you write her.

408
00:59:50,768 --> 00:59:53,062
怎么回事?
What's wrong, Jim?

409
01:01:13,601 --> 01:01:18,147
他没救了 谁也救不了他
There's nothing anybody can do for him. He'll die before they get him to a surgeon.

410
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:23,235
你不必去了  我可以替他注射吗啡
Then I can't ask you to go out there.  Maybe I could get some morphine into him.

411
01:01:23,319 --> 01:01:26,572
能让他安静吗?  不能 我可以打两针
Would it keep him quiet?  Not for long, but I can give him two.

412
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:30,075
留三 四针给他自己打
And I could maybe leave him three or four for himself.

413
01:01:32,161 --> 01:01:34,455
你能一次打完吗?
Couldn't you give 'em to him all at once?

414
01:01:52,932 --> 01:01:55,017
你们都会死
That's what you are.

415
01:01:56,727 --> 01:01:59,855
我们全都会没命
That's all there is for us. That's us, that's us.

416
01:02:00,439 --> 01:02:03,692
我的十二名弟兄都死了
I lost all twelve. I lost all twelve.

417
01:02:04,944 --> 01:02:06,862
全都挂了
All twelve of 'em.

418
01:02:06,946 --> 01:02:08,405
太疯狂了
It's insanity up there.

419
01:02:08,489 --> 01:02:12,576
我叫他们勇往直前
I told 'em what to do, I showed 'em where to go and I gave 'em a push.

420
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:17,998
救命  我认得你...副连长
Somebody help!  I know you. I know you, Sergeant.

421
01:02:18,082 --> 01:02:22,795
这里谁指挥? 别放走他
It's insane. I don't know who's in charge here, but don't let him go! Don't let him go!

422
01:02:22,878 --> 01:02:24,922
我要走 我要走
I'm outta here. I'm outta here.

423
01:02:25,005 --> 01:02:29,134
两只脚 快走 走啊
I'm outta here. All right, move feet. Move, move, move, move. Move, move!

424
01:02:29,218 --> 01:02:31,971
我要走了 我要走了...
I'm moving. I'm moving. I'm moving now.

425
01:02:32,054 --> 01:02:36,725
别碰我 别看我 别碰我 别看我 我走了
Don't touch. Don't touch. Don't look at me. Don't touch. OK, I'm outta here.

426
01:02:36,809 --> 01:02:38,811
没事了 没事了
All right. All right.

427
01:02:38,894 --> 01:02:41,855
没事了 没事了
All right. All right.

428
01:02:59,873 --> 01:03:02,001
救救我
Somebody help me!

429
01:03:02,084 --> 01:03:03,335
救救我!
Help me!

430
01:03:05,587 --> 01:03:08,215
还好吧 小子? 我来救你了 提拉
You gotta be quiet. I came to help you, Tella.

431
01:03:08,298 --> 01:03:10,718
安静点  去你的
OK. Calm down.  Fuck you!

432
01:03:10,801 --> 01:03:13,887
我快死了 我快死了
I'm dying! I'm dying, sarge!

433
01:03:13,971 --> 01:03:16,390
那就安静地等死
OK. Well, goddamn it, do it with less noise!

434
01:03:17,391 --> 01:03:20,227
你能救我吗?  我会带你回去
How you gonna get me out?  I'm gonna take you back.

435
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:25,316
来  不!
Come on.  No!

436
01:03:25,399 --> 01:03:27,985
放我下来 放我下来
Put me down! Put me down!

437
01:03:33,365 --> 01:03:36,327
别管我 你别管我
Leave me alone... Leave me alone.

438
01:03:36,452 --> 01:03:38,787
你别管我
Please, leave me alone.

439
01:03:47,212 --> 01:03:49,298
给我多一点 给我多一点
Give me more. Give me more.

440
01:03:49,923 --> 01:03:52,176
再给我多一点...
Give me more. Give me more.

441
01:03:52,259 --> 01:03:54,428
再给我多一点...
Give me more. Give me more.

442
01:03:57,556 --> 01:03:58,807
来吧
Here, Tella.

443
01:04:07,566 --> 01:04:10,194
再见...再见...
Goodbye... goodbye.

444
01:04:13,489 --> 01:04:15,157
再见了 小子
Bye, kid.

445
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:18,243
再见 副连长
Goodbye, sarge. Goodbye.

446
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:38,472
幸好部队不必只靠一个大兵
Fortunately, Jim, the fate of the company doesn't depend on one man.

447
01:04:43,352 --> 01:04:46,438
我用望远镜看到经过
Sergeant, I saw the whole thing through the glasses.

448
01:04:46,522 --> 01:04:50,776
我会请营长表扬你
I'm gonna mention you in orders tomorrow and recommend you for the Silver Star.

449
01:04:50,859 --> 01:04:53,487
我要替你争取银星勋章  长官
It's the most courageous thing...  Captain,

450
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:57,783
你再说下去我就把你揍扁
you say one more word to thank me, I'll knock you right in the teeth.

451
01:04:57,866 --> 01:05:01,578
你去争取勋章 我马上辞职
You mention me in your fuckin' orders, and I'll resign so fast

452
01:05:01,662 --> 01:05:05,707
让你一个人指挥这个烂部队
and leave you here to run this bustedup outfit by yourself.

453
01:05:06,959 --> 01:05:09,044
懂不懂?
You understand?

454
01:05:09,753 --> 01:05:13,507
权力! 打仗全是为了权力
Property! Whole fuckin' thing's about property.

455
01:05:28,439 --> 01:05:32,734
你在搞什么鬼? 马上派人支援他们
What's the matter with you, Staros? Those men should be reinforced immediately!

456
01:05:32,818 --> 01:05:35,654
他们在干嘛?
What are they doing? I can see 'em through my glasses.

457
01:05:35,737 --> 01:05:37,823
躲在那里做什么?
They're lying behind that ledge!

458
01:05:37,906 --> 01:05:41,452
他们应该去消灭机关枪
They should be up and out, cleaning out those machine guns! Over!

459
01:05:41,535 --> 01:05:44,455
我想你不明白 长官
I don't think you understand what's going on, sir.

460
01:05:44,538 --> 01:05:47,416
我们的伤亡惨重
We've had... heavy casualties.

461
01:05:47,499 --> 01:05:52,379
有一个人的肠子被打出来 死得很惨
We had a man... His gut got shot out on the slopes, sir. Created quite an upset.

462
01:05:52,462 --> 01:05:55,632
好吧 到底有没有支援?
Fine, fine. Now, what about those reinforcements? Over.

463
01:05:55,716 --> 01:06:01,555
第一排有两个班可以支援
I have two squads to First Platoon I can send up, sir. Over.

464
01:06:01,638 --> 01:06:04,057
什么 两个班?!
What the hell do you mean, two squads?!

465
01:06:04,141 --> 01:06:07,603
该死 我叫你支援就照办
Goddamn you, Staros! When I say reinforcements,

466
01:06:07,686 --> 01:06:12,441
马上派全体兄弟攻上去
goddamn it, I mean it! You commit everybody you have there and do it now!

467
01:06:12,524 --> 01:06:16,528
第一排也得去 我看到他们躺着不动
Your First Platoon, too. I see 'em lying on their fat asses doing nothing.

468
01:06:16,612 --> 01:06:21,658
派人上去 命令他们进攻 命令他们侧攻
Get a man to 'em right now with orders to attack, and move 'em by the flank to the ridge.

469
01:06:21,742 --> 01:06:24,536
然后叫第二排攻上山头
Then get that Second Platoon over to the hill!

470
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:27,873
叫他们直接攻上去
Have 'em press the centre. Go straight up that goddamn hill!

471
01:06:27,956 --> 01:06:29,625
马上进攻
Attack them right now!

472
01:06:29,708 --> 01:06:33,504
天啊 要我教吗?
Jesus, Staros! Do i have to give you a lesson on infantry tactics

473
01:06:33,587 --> 01:06:36,215
你的兄弟快被射死了
while your men are getting their asses shot off?.

474
01:06:36,298 --> 01:06:40,052
上校 你不明白这里的情况
Colonel, I don't think you fully understand what is going on here.

475
01:06:40,135 --> 01:06:43,347
光凭这一队不能攻下山头
My company alone cannot take that position, sir.

476
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:46,934
敌军防守严密 火力太强
The Japs are too well dug in. They've got too much fire power.

477
01:06:47,017 --> 01:06:49,102
上面有座碉堡
Colonel, there's a bunker up there.

478
01:06:49,186 --> 01:06:52,564
我们看不到 它把我的兄弟打得很惨
We can't see it, and it's... it's chewing my men to pieces, sir.

479
01:06:55,734 --> 01:06:59,321
请你准许我先派人
I request permission for patrol reconnaissance around

480
01:06:59,404 --> 01:07:03,033
进入右边的森林搜查
to the right of Hill 210. I believe the entire position, sir,

481
01:07:03,116 --> 01:07:05,744
从右边包抄应该能攻下山头
can be outflanked with a manoeuvre there in force.

482
01:07:05,827 --> 01:07:08,121
不行 该死  挽救生命
No! Goddamn it, no!  Might save lives!

483
01:07:08,205 --> 01:07:10,082
不能包抄
There'll be no flanking move.

484
01:07:10,165 --> 01:07:13,001
听我说 你不能带兄弟
Listen, Staros. You're not gonna take your men

485
01:07:13,085 --> 01:07:16,546
躲到丛林当缩头乌龟
around into the jungle to avoid a goddamn fight!

486
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:22,177
我要你带领兄弟全力进攻
Do you hear me, Staros? I want you to attack right now with every man at your disposal!

487
01:07:22,261 --> 01:07:25,138
史塔奥 快进攻 这是命令
Now, attack, Staros! That's a direct order!

488
01:07:34,523 --> 01:07:37,484
我必须违背你的命令
Sir, I must tell you that I refuse to obey your order.

489
01:07:51,957 --> 01:07:55,919
在那里 能看见吗?  看不见
There it is, right there. See it?  I don't see it.

490
01:07:56,670 --> 01:07:59,464
你没有错 他下了命令
This is not your fault, Jim. He's ordering you to.

491
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:08,473
我请你让我派人到丛林搜查
I again request permission for patrol reconnaissance around to the right in force.

492
01:08:09,725 --> 01:08:13,437
现在时间是...13时21分25秒
The time, sir,... is 1321 hours, 25 seconds.

493
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:18,525
两名证人听到我的话 请你也找证人
I have two witnesses here. I request that you do the same with witnesses there. Over.

494
01:08:23,697 --> 01:08:27,242
别给我来律师那一套
Staros, don't pull this guardhouselawyer bullshit with me!

495
01:08:27,326 --> 01:08:31,455
你是律师 这里却不是法庭
Now, I know you're a goddamn lawyer! This is not a court of law.

496
01:08:31,538 --> 01:08:33,790
这是战场 我们在打仗
This is a war. It's a goddamn battle!

497
01:08:33,874 --> 01:08:38,754
我重覆 我要你正面攻击
Now, I want that frontal attack. I repeat my order. Over.

498
01:08:38,837 --> 01:08:42,507
我拒绝率领兄弟作正面攻击
Colonel, I refuse to take my men up there in a frontal attack.

499
01:08:42,591 --> 01:08:44,760
这等于是自杀
It's suicide, sir.

500
01:08:44,843 --> 01:08:50,015
我和他们生活两年半 不能命令他们送死 完毕
I've lived with these men for two years, and I will not order them all to their deaths. Over.

501
01:08:59,024 --> 01:09:01,610
这是很重大的决定
This is a very important decision, Staros.

502
01:09:05,197 --> 01:09:09,034
也许你有理由这么做
But if you feel that strongly, maybe you have a reason, so I'm coming down.

503
01:09:09,117 --> 01:09:11,495
我要过去
Go take a look.

504
01:09:11,578 --> 01:09:14,289
我不是取消命令
I'm not rescinding my order to you, son,

505
01:09:14,373 --> 01:09:19,211
不过如果是特殊状况 我会仔细考虑
but if I find extenuating circumstances when I get there, I'll take that into account.

506
01:09:19,294 --> 01:09:23,590
你们守在那儿等我来
Now, in the meantime, goddamn it, I want you to hold on until I get there.

507
01:09:23,673 --> 01:09:27,886
可能的话叫那些兄弟前进 完毕
And, if possible, you get those men on the ridge out and moving! Out.

508
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,508
(希腊语)


509
01:09:41,108 --> 01:09:43,735
哪里都一样
One spot's as good as another, men.

510
01:09:43,819 --> 01:09:45,904
根本就无处可躲
There's no place to hide.

511
01:09:50,409 --> 01:09:54,913
孩子 放松点
Just take it easy, son. Take it easy. Take it easy.

512
01:09:55,914 --> 01:09:58,375
费夫呢?
Where's... where's Fife?

513
01:09:58,458 --> 01:10:00,669
在这儿 费夫
Fife? He's right here, son. Fife.

514
01:10:00,752 --> 01:10:03,380
握住我的手
Hold my hand, Fife.

515
01:10:04,297 --> 01:10:06,383
握我的手
Hold my hand.

516
01:10:11,555 --> 01:10:13,557
抓住了
I got it.

517
01:10:17,561 --> 01:10:19,646
我快死了
I'm dying, Fife.

518
01:10:46,673 --> 01:10:48,842
连长...
Oh, Captain...

519
01:11:37,891 --> 01:11:40,227
我被埋在棺材里
Shut up in a tomb.

520
01:11:42,187 --> 01:11:44,481
掀不起棺盖
Can't lift the lid.

521
01:11:46,733 --> 01:11:49,027
我的处境进退两难
Played a role I never conceived.

522
01:11:49,402 --> 01:11:53,323
穿上衣服 这不是海滩
Get that blouse on, soldier. It's not a goddamn bathing beach!

523
01:11:53,406 --> 01:11:55,075
立刻穿上
Put it on right now.

524
01:11:55,158 --> 01:11:58,537
你在指谁? 去杀敌呀
What you aiming at, son? Let's go get those son of a bitches.

525
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:00,705
前进!
Move up!

526
01:12:10,549 --> 01:12:14,219
你趴在这儿什么也看不到
What are you doing laying down there where you can't see a damn thing?

527
01:12:19,808 --> 01:12:23,103
我正在观察 我派第一排上去
Observing, sir. Just sent First Platoon forward to the ridge.

528
01:12:23,186 --> 01:12:26,815
这次有几个中弹?  没有
How many of 'em were hit this time?  None, sir.

529
01:12:26,898 --> 01:12:28,984
一个都没有?
None? Not one?

530
01:12:29,985 --> 01:12:33,947
这跟你说的情况不一样
Doesn't sound like the situation you described to me over the sound power.

531
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:38,618
五分钟前情况改变了
Well, it's not. The situation's changed just in the last five minutes, sir.

532
01:12:42,163 --> 01:12:44,249
上尉 给我听住
Captain, you listen to me.

533
01:12:44,332 --> 01:12:46,960
我们要全力向前进攻
We're going over there and taking everybody with us.

534
01:12:47,043 --> 01:12:49,546
有问题吗?
Do you have any more complaints or demurrers?

535
01:12:50,964 --> 01:12:54,301
现在 没有  好吧 你得照我的方法
No, sir. Not now.  All right! We're gonna do things my way!

536
01:12:54,384 --> 01:12:56,803
让我来指挥
My way! You understand that, Captain?

537
01:12:56,886 --> 01:13:01,182
大家上去 晚上得攻下来
We're taking everybody over to that ledge! We may take that ridge by nightfall!

538
01:13:01,266 --> 01:13:05,145
上面的火力还是很强
I think the ridge is quite a way from being reduced, sir.

539
01:13:12,319 --> 01:13:14,821
神啊 你到底看到什么?
Show me how to see things the way you do.

540
01:13:18,033 --> 01:13:20,368
让我知道你看到什么
Show me how to see things the way you do.

541
01:13:23,705 --> 01:13:26,833
我们全是尘土
We're just dirt. We're just dirt.

542
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:52,943
留在这儿肯定送命
We're gonna get killed if we stay here.

543
01:13:53,026 --> 01:13:56,279
比尔 带六个弟兄
Bell, take six men

544
01:13:56,363 --> 01:13:58,448
上去探查
and go see what's up there.

545
01:14:03,828 --> 01:14:06,873
我们会掩护你们
And we'll cover you the best we can from down there.

546
01:15:26,619 --> 01:15:28,079
好
OK.

547
01:15:28,163 --> 01:15:30,665
你们留下来
You guys, you guys, stay here. OK?

548
01:15:31,791 --> 01:15:33,877
我一个人去
I'm going alone.

549
01:17:13,476 --> 01:17:15,562
来吧
Come out.

550
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:22,986
到我的身边
Come out where lam.

551
01:18:31,471 --> 01:18:34,224
上面有...上面有...
There was a... There was a...

552
01:18:35,516 --> 01:18:38,228
上面有一座碉堡
There's a bunker... up there.

553
01:18:40,063 --> 01:18:42,148
总共有五支机关枪
It's five guns.

554
01:18:42,482 --> 01:18:44,776
五支机关枪
It's five guns.

555
01:18:49,197 --> 01:18:54,077
攻下那些乱石间的碉堡
That strongpoint up there, somewhere up there around those rocks,

556
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,246
就能攻下这座山头
is the key to this ridge.

557
01:18:59,332 --> 01:19:01,459
比尔说得没错
Bell here is quite right.

558
01:19:01,542 --> 01:19:07,257
日本鬼子从上面
From their knob up there, those little brown brothers can cover the whole of the ground

559
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:11,678
可以扫射一千码内的目标 不过他们漏掉这地方
in front of this position for 1,000 yards. They've left this ledge unguarded.

560
01:19:11,761 --> 01:19:15,723
这是很严重的错误 这是很严重的错误
Now, goddamn it, that's a mistake. That's a hell of a mistake.

561
01:19:15,807 --> 01:19:19,978
我们得利用他们的疏忽
We need to take advantage of it before they see their error.

562
01:19:22,397 --> 01:19:25,858
我知道你们筋疲力尽
All right, all right, I know you're all pretty exhausted,

563
01:19:25,942 --> 01:19:29,404
这里连清水也没有
and we've had a hell of a time getting water up here.

564
01:19:30,279 --> 01:19:33,199
对不起 我向大家道歉
For that I'm sorry. I apologise to you all.

565
01:19:34,325 --> 01:19:38,997
不过明天若能攻下这座碉堡 就能占领山头
But if we can reduce this bunker tomorrow, I think we can take this ridge.

566
01:19:41,833 --> 01:19:44,168
有没有人自愿
So I'm asking for volunteers.

567
01:19:44,252 --> 01:19:46,504
回去攻下那座碉堡
Go back up there and knock it out.

568
01:19:46,587 --> 01:19:48,673
长官
Sir?

569
01:19:48,756 --> 01:19:50,842
我愿意...
I'll be glad to go back up

570
01:19:50,925 --> 01:19:53,261
身先士卒回去作战  很好 比尔
and lead the way back for a party.  Right.

571
01:19:53,344 --> 01:19:55,054
上校 我也去  还有你
I'll go, sir.  You.

572
01:19:55,805 --> 01:19:57,265
好的
All right.

573
01:19:57,348 --> 01:20:02,186
我很想率领突击队  我正希望你去 约翰
I'd like to lead the party, Colonel.  All right, John. I was hoping you'd say that.

574
01:20:02,270 --> 01:20:05,189
你来指挥  我要去
You'll be in command.  I'll go, sir.

575
01:20:05,273 --> 01:20:06,649
长官  你
Sir?  You.

576
01:20:06,733 --> 01:20:10,737
够了 七个人够多了 准备出发
All right, men, that's enough. Seven is plenty. Gather up.

577
01:20:14,532 --> 01:20:19,037
史塔奥 你知道这一役有多重要吗?
I don't know if you realise the importance of this operation, Staros.

578
01:20:20,204 --> 01:20:23,624
攻下这座岛 轰炸机就能降落
Once our position is secured, we can move the bombers in.

579
01:20:23,708 --> 01:20:27,670
我们的军队 便有一千英里的空中攻击力
That means air power for 1,000 miles in every direction.

580
01:20:29,088 --> 01:20:32,216
窝达康拉尔岛一役能决定胜负
Guadalcanal may be the turning point in the war.

581
01:20:33,342 --> 01:20:36,929
你不同意 一定得牺牲性命?  不是 长官
It'll cost lives. Is that what's troubling you?  No, sir.

582
01:20:40,058 --> 01:20:43,061
我跟你说过胜利的重要
I explained to you the importance of this objective.

583
01:20:43,144 --> 01:20:46,355
你认为牺牲多少兄弟才值得?
How many men do you think it's worth? How many lives?

584
01:20:46,439 --> 01:20:48,524
我不知道
I can't say, sir.

585
01:20:54,422 --> 01:20:59,660
你愿意牺牲你的兄弟吗?
Are you prepared to sacrifice the lives of any of your men in this campaign?

586
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:04,245
多少? 一个? 两个?
How many? One? Two?

587
01:21:04,805 --> 01:21:06,891
二十个?
Twenty?

588
01:21:08,309 --> 01:21:11,437
你的小队一定会死人
Lives will be lost in your company, Captain.

589
01:21:12,771 --> 01:21:17,193
要是你受不了 现在最好让我知道
And if you don't have the stomach for it, now is the time to let me know.

590
01:21:18,068 --> 01:21:21,989
不 你说得对 你说得都对
No, sir. You're right... about everything you said.

591
01:21:22,072 --> 01:21:24,158
好吧 没事了
Fine, fine.

592
01:21:24,241 --> 01:21:26,327
好吧 长官
That's all, Captain.

593
01:21:28,037 --> 01:21:30,122
还有一件事
One more thing, Staros.

594
01:21:30,873 --> 01:21:35,169
你不必跟我说我说得对
It's not necessary for you to ever tell me that you think I'm right.

595
01:21:35,753 --> 01:21:37,421
没有必要
Ever.

596
01:21:37,504 --> 01:21:39,840
这是理所当然的
We'll assume it.

597
01:21:39,924 --> 01:21:41,800
解散
Dismissed.

598
01:21:58,609 --> 01:22:00,694
我为你感到遗憾
I feel sorry for you, kid.

599
01:22:02,071 --> 01:22:04,156
是吗?  有一点吧
Yeah?  Yeah, a little.

600
01:22:07,618 --> 01:22:09,703
这场仗会害死你
This army's gonna kill you.

601
01:22:13,207 --> 01:22:19,171
你还是保佑自己好运点 别想救别人了
If you were smart, you'd take care of yourself. There's nothing you can do for anybody else.

602
01:22:19,255 --> 01:22:23,425
就算你拼命也救不了什么人
You're just running into a burning house where nobody can be saved.

603
01:22:36,271 --> 01:22:41,110
在乱世中一个人的力量很渺小
What difference do you think you can make? One single man in all this madness.

604
01:22:46,657 --> 01:22:49,076
不要白白送死
If you die, it's gonna be for nothing.

605
01:22:53,205 --> 01:22:57,876
没有另一个美好世界
There's not some other world out there where everything's gonna be OK.

606
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:00,045
这是唯一的世界
There's just this one.

607
01:23:01,964 --> 01:23:04,049
只有这座孤岛
Just this rock.

608
01:23:41,003 --> 01:23:43,505
来吧 让我死吧
Go ahead! Come on, come on.

609
01:23:43,589 --> 01:23:46,717
谁能决定别人的生?
Who's deciding who's gonna live?

610
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:49,511
谁能决定别人的死?
Who's deciding who's gonna die?

611
01:23:51,388 --> 01:23:53,474
太荒谬了
This is futile!

612
01:23:54,933 --> 01:24:00,022
看看我 我身上没有中弹
Look at me! I stand right up here and not one bullet.

613
01:24:00,105 --> 01:24:02,191
毫发未伤!
Not one shot!

614
01:24:03,108 --> 01:24:04,985
为什么?
Why?

615
01:24:05,277 --> 01:24:07,363
他们全都死了
How come they all had to die?

616
01:24:07,446 --> 01:24:11,909
我却站在这儿 一点事也没有
I can stand right here, I can stand right up and nothing happens to me!

617
01:24:32,429 --> 01:24:34,515
我们
We.

618
01:24:41,063 --> 01:24:43,148
我们在一起
We together.

619
01:24:53,867 --> 01:24:55,953
合而为一
One being.

620
01:25:10,968 --> 01:25:13,262
水乳交融
Flow together like water,

621
01:25:16,557 --> 01:25:18,851
分不出你和我
till I can't tell you from me.

622
01:25:36,743 --> 01:25:38,829
我爱你
I drink you.

623
01:25:40,873 --> 01:25:42,958
现在
Now.

624
01:25:45,294 --> 01:25:47,379
现在
Now.

625
01:26:23,999 --> 01:26:26,084
您是我的明灯
You're my light.

626
01:26:29,338 --> 01:26:31,423
我的指引
My guide.

627
01:27:40,284 --> 01:27:43,954
我们在后面 要是攻破防线
John, I'll be behind you. If you wanna break through, we'll come after.

628
01:27:44,037 --> 01:27:46,582
就吹哨子通知我们冲上去
We'll charge at your whistle signal.

629
01:27:47,332 --> 01:27:49,835
去吧 去杀敌吧
All right, let's go, men. Go get 'em.

630
01:29:44,157 --> 01:29:46,243
好
OK.

631
01:29:47,244 --> 01:29:49,913
你们留在底下
Stay down, below this ledge,

632
01:29:49,996 --> 01:29:54,000
我从上面叫出敌人方位
and I'll call down the data from above.

633
01:29:54,084 --> 01:29:58,672
让炮兵密集轰炸这些岩石
Once the 81s have plastered that rock... as much as possible,

634
01:29:58,755 --> 01:30:02,551
再到大石旁找掩护
we're gonna crawl out along that big rock for cover

635
01:30:04,052 --> 01:30:06,138
然后从右翼进攻
and then flank 'em to the right.

636
01:30:06,221 --> 01:30:08,098
好吗?
OK?

637
01:30:09,599 --> 01:30:12,185
好...好
OK. OK.

638
01:30:32,873 --> 01:30:37,461

上吧
Let's go!

651
01:32:02,712 --> 01:32:06,132
从右翼攻上山头
OK, we're gonna continue on up the hill to the right.

652
01:32:06,216 --> 01:32:10,470
等我信号再开枪或丢手榴弹
Nobody fire or throw the grenades till I give the signal.

653
01:32:10,554 --> 01:32:12,639
好 咱们上
OK, let's do it.

654
01:32:27,279 --> 01:32:30,240
他没事吧?
Is he OK? ls he all right?

655
01:32:30,323 --> 01:32:32,701
不能把他带走 怎么办?
What we gonna do? Can't take him with us.

656
01:32:32,784 --> 01:32:36,830
不能把他留下来  你们是同队兄弟 你陪他
No, we can't leave him here.  He's from your platoon. You stay with him.

657
01:32:36,913 --> 01:32:40,917
我们回来再接他...如果他还活着
We can leave him and pick him up on the way back,... if he's still alive.

658
01:32:44,796 --> 01:32:47,215
他死了吗?  还没有
Is he dead?  Not yet.

659
01:32:47,299 --> 01:32:50,886
陪着他 掩护我们 冲吧
Dale, stay with him! Cover our flank! Move!

660
01:33:15,619 --> 01:33:16,703
小心后面
Behind you!

661
01:33:32,135 --> 01:33:34,220
我们被打得好惨
We're pinned down!

662
01:34:04,167 --> 01:34:06,252
撤退
Fall back!

663
01:34:11,216 --> 01:34:12,676
走吧
Go!

664
01:35:23,788 --> 01:35:25,874
小心
Watch out.

665
01:36:04,496 --> 01:36:05,955
安全了!
Clear!

666
01:36:58,174 --> 01:37:00,260
给我滚出来
Come on. Get out.

667
01:37:01,636 --> 01:37:03,721
出来
Go on.

668
01:37:06,724 --> 01:37:08,810
你想杀我们?
Think you're soldiers?

669
01:37:15,817 --> 01:37:18,069
你这人渣
You piece of shit!

670
01:37:24,325 --> 01:37:26,202
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch!

671
01:37:26,286 --> 01:37:28,371
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch!

672
01:37:47,390 --> 01:37:49,475
如何?
All right?

673
01:37:52,228 --> 01:37:54,314
我杀死一个人
I shot a man.

674
01:38:29,557 --> 01:38:31,643
这里好臭
Stinks around here.

675
01:38:32,852 --> 01:38:36,397
这么多死人  鼻孔里塞烟头
All these dead people.  Put a cigarette up your nose.

676
01:39:58,521 --> 01:40:00,982
看他们逃命!
Look at 'em move!

677
01:40:01,065 --> 01:40:02,817
看他们逃命!
Look at 'em move!

678
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:04,777
把他们赶跑了
We got 'em on the run!

679
01:40:04,861 --> 01:40:08,072
约翰 干得好 你把他们打得落花流水
Way to go, John. When they saw you make that attack and win,

680
01:40:08,156 --> 01:40:10,700
兄弟们都士气高涨
you put their hearts back into them.

681
01:40:10,783 --> 01:40:12,994
嘿 嘿  别打了
Hey, hey!  Don't do that, soldier.

682
01:40:13,077 --> 01:40:17,915
把犯人带来 交给情报部 他们马上就来
Take care of the others. G2 will want them. There'll be somebody around before long.

683
01:40:17,999 --> 01:40:20,460
浪费了很多时间 走吧
We've wasted enough time here. Let's go.

684
01:40:20,543 --> 01:40:23,296
我要推荐一些人接受勋章
Sir, I've a few recommendations for decorations.

685
01:40:23,379 --> 01:40:26,924
我会尽力向他们争取 但是迟些再说
Yes. We'll get everything for all of 'em that we can, but later.

686
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:31,471
不过我要你知道 我会推荐你接受勋章
Meantime, I want you to know I'm personally recommending you for something, John.

687
01:40:31,554 --> 01:40:33,014
也许是英勇奖章
Perhaps the big one.

688
01:40:33,097 --> 01:40:36,184
谢谢你 不过我...  这是你应得的
Thank you, sir, but I don't feel...  Yes, you do, John.

689
01:40:36,267 --> 01:40:39,103
能不能争取到才是问题
Getting it for you will be the goddamn problem!

690
01:40:39,187 --> 01:40:43,608
你能受勋对部队有很大鼓舞
But, hell, it'd be a big thing for the battalion and the regiment, if you did get it.

691
01:40:43,691 --> 01:40:45,359
最好赶快前进
We better move out.

692
01:40:45,443 --> 01:40:49,989
加入别的部队攻上山头
We need to extend our lines, hook up with the other companies and push on to the top.

693
01:40:50,073 --> 01:40:53,034
你想指挥B队吗?
Would you like to take command of Baker Company?

694
01:40:53,117 --> 01:40:54,160
当然想
Of course.

695
01:40:54,243 --> 01:40:58,873
我不想扫你的兴 但是没有食水...
Sir, I don't mean to be a wet blanket, but about the water. If we don't get water...

696
01:40:58,956 --> 01:41:01,042
别担心水的问题
Don't worry about water.

697
01:41:02,543 --> 01:41:07,799
现在士气如虹 不能中断
John, I don't want anything to break up this attack of ours now we have the momentum.

698
01:41:07,882 --> 01:41:11,427
过几个小时就有食用水
We'll have some water in a... couple of hours.

699
01:41:11,511 --> 01:41:13,596
我会安排的
I've arranged for that.

700
01:41:14,222 --> 01:41:17,725
该死 现在不能停下来
Now, we just can't stop now, goddamn it, and wait for it.

701
01:41:17,809 --> 01:41:19,685
是的 长官
No, sir.

702
01:41:19,769 --> 01:41:21,979
没错
That's right.

703
01:41:22,063 --> 01:41:27,860
如果有些人因脱水昏倒 那就让他们昏倒
And if some of the men... pass out, why, hell, they'll just have to pass out.

704
01:41:31,656 --> 01:41:33,533
好吧
All right.

705
01:41:33,616 --> 01:41:35,076
他们会死的
They could...

706
01:41:35,159 --> 01:41:38,496
他们也会被敌人杀死
They could die from it.They could die from enemy fire, too!

707
01:41:39,831 --> 01:41:42,125
他们很坚强
They're all tough boys.

708
01:41:46,879 --> 01:41:52,009
兄弟们 走吧 一路上会有更多死人
Come on, men, let's go! You'll see plenty more of those where we're going!

709
01:41:52,093 --> 01:41:54,679
到底要不要上山头?
Are we going up this hill or aren't we?

710
01:41:58,558 --> 01:42:02,520
我相信现在能突破日军防线
John, I'm convinced that the Japanese position can be broken now.

711
01:42:02,603 --> 01:42:07,692
只要继续前进 日落时就能攻下山头
All we have to do is keep going and we'll have this hill. We'll have this hill by sundown.

712
01:42:07,775 --> 01:42:10,778
看到他们全新的斗志吗?
You see the spirit in these men? D'you see the new spirit?

713
01:42:10,862 --> 01:42:16,033
我们得一鼓作气 乘胜追击
Well, I want to take advantage of that before something happens to sap their strength.

714
01:42:16,117 --> 01:42:18,995
要是稍微迟疑就会战败
To have this battalion relieved in a defeat,

715
01:42:19,078 --> 01:42:26,002
或者是根本攻不上山头
or even to have it reinforced from troops from the reserves,if we were to stall before reaching the top, well,

716
01:42:26,085 --> 01:42:30,339
天啊 我不能忍受失败
Jesus Christ, that's just a hell of a lot more than I could stand!

717
01:42:30,423 --> 01:42:32,800
我等了一辈子
I've waited all my life for this.

718
01:42:32,884 --> 01:42:37,430
一直以来忍气吞声 都是为了这一刻
I've worked, slaved, eaten... oh, untold buckets of shit to have this opportunity!

719
01:42:37,513 --> 01:42:39,974
我不会半途而废
And I don't intend to give it up now.

720
01:42:43,144 --> 01:42:46,814
你不知道被忽略的感受
You don't know what it feels like to be passed over.

721
01:42:46,898 --> 01:42:50,067
你刚出军校 还很年轻
I mean, you're young. You're just out of the Academy.

722
01:42:50,151 --> 01:42:55,823
你生对时代了 我等了十五年才等到这场战争
You're, you know, you've got your war! This 15 years, this is my first war!

723
01:43:01,287 --> 01:43:04,624
有一天你会了解
John, some day you'll understand.

724
01:43:10,505 --> 01:43:12,590
我把你当儿子看待
You're like a son to me, John.

725
01:43:14,967 --> 01:43:17,053
知道我儿子做什么吗?
You know what my son does?

726
01:43:17,970 --> 01:43:20,056
他做鱼饵生意
He's a bait salesman.

727
01:43:22,642 --> 01:43:24,727
你干得很好
You've done a hell of a job, John.

728
01:43:24,810 --> 01:43:29,690
我要让你得到应得的荣誉
I'm gonna make sure that you get everything, everything that you deserve.

729
01:43:31,943 --> 01:43:34,028
谢谢你 长官
Thank you, sir.

730
01:43:36,113 --> 01:43:38,199
天啊...
God...

731
01:43:39,242 --> 01:43:41,744
该死 我要三名传令兵
Goddamn it! I want three runners!

732
01:43:41,827 --> 01:43:43,496
给我三名传令兵
Get me three runners!

733
01:43:43,579 --> 01:43:45,831
回去找水源
You go back to the rear to find water

734
01:43:45,915 --> 01:43:48,793
马上运过来
and get back here with it as fast as you can!

735
01:43:49,710 --> 01:43:52,922
一小时后就全力进攻
We attack in one hour! We'll throw everything we got at 'em.

736
01:43:53,005 --> 01:43:55,508
不能失败 没人能阻止
We're going all the way! Nothing'll stop us.

737
01:43:55,591 --> 01:43:57,677
晚上就得成功
It's high ground by nightfall!

738
01:44:21,826 --> 01:44:24,370
你看过死人吗?
You seen many dead people?

739
01:44:25,162 --> 01:44:27,123
很多
Plenty.

740
01:44:27,206 --> 01:44:29,834
跟死狗没两样
They're no different than dead dogs,

741
01:44:30,543 --> 01:44:32,628
只要有这种想法
once you get used to the idea.

742
01:44:37,466 --> 01:44:39,552
他们就像猪肉一样
They're meat, kid.

743
01:44:55,609 --> 01:44:58,571
你们代表正义和善良吗?
Are you righteous? Kind?

744
01:45:01,657 --> 01:45:03,826
你们是否有信心?
Does your confidence lie in this?

745
01:45:07,246 --> 01:45:09,332
受到大家爱护?
Are you loved by all?

746
01:45:11,626 --> 01:45:13,711
我跟你们一样
Know that I was, too.

747
01:45:17,298 --> 01:45:21,969
你们认为自己所受的苦难 是比较少吗?
Do you imagine your sufferings will be less because you loved goodness?

748
01:45:22,595 --> 01:45:24,680
我们善良有良知
Truth?

749
01:49:23,043 --> 01:49:26,255
趴下来 趴下来
Get fucking on the ground! Get down! Get down!

750
01:49:27,006 --> 01:49:29,091
趴下来 呆着
Get down. Stay there.

751
01:49:37,558 --> 01:49:41,437
给我趴下来 快点
Get on the ground! Get on the fucking ground!

752
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:43,397
快!
Now!

753
01:50:42,923 --> 01:50:45,009
这么可怕的邪恶
This great evil.

754
01:50:47,761 --> 01:50:49,847
它来自哪里?
Where's it come from?

755
01:50:54,518 --> 01:50:56,604
怎么会潜伏在世上?
How'd it steal into the world?

756
01:51:08,365 --> 01:51:11,911
原因和根源到底是什么?
What seed, what root did it grow from?

757
01:51:16,832 --> 01:51:18,918
这是谁造成的?
Who's doing this?

758
01:51:21,504 --> 01:51:23,589
谁在屠杀众生
Who's killing us?

759
01:51:27,551 --> 01:51:30,054
剥夺我们的生命之火
Robbing us of life and light.

760
01:51:34,809 --> 01:51:38,229
嘲笑我们对人间的依恋
Mocking us with the sight of what we might have known.

761
01:52:04,213 --> 01:52:06,924
战争对地球有利吗?
Does our ruin benefit the Earth?

762
01:52:09,301 --> 01:52:12,930
它能滋长万物 孕育众生吗?
Does it help the grass to grow or the sun to shine?

763
01:52:19,103 --> 01:52:21,397
上帝也有黑暗的一面?
Is this darkness in you, too?

764
01:52:27,861 --> 01:52:30,197
他是否也感受邪恶力量?
Have you passed through this night?

765
01:52:36,412 --> 01:52:38,956
我要把你开膛剖肚
I'm gonna sink my teeth into your liver.

766
01:52:42,668 --> 01:52:44,753
你死定了
You're dying.

767
01:52:56,682 --> 01:52:58,809
看到那些鸟吗?
See them birds up there?

768
01:53:00,561 --> 01:53:02,855
它们会把你生吞活剥
You know they eat you raw?

769
01:53:07,776 --> 01:53:10,946
你下地狱就回不来
Where you're going, you're not coming back from.

770
01:53:17,439 --> 01:53:20,408
(日语)


771
01:54:22,434 --> 01:54:24,520
你对我有意义吗?
What are you to me?

772
01:54:30,317 --> 01:54:32,403
毫无义意
Nothing.

773
01:56:53,627 --> 01:56:55,712
坐下来
Have a seat here.

774
01:57:05,973 --> 01:57:08,767
史塔奥 我要将你革职
Staros, I'm relieving you of your command.

775
01:57:12,145 --> 01:57:14,523
班中尉会取代你
Lieutenant Band will take over for you.

776
01:57:16,233 --> 01:57:18,318
我跟他说了
I already told him.

777
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:30,998
我也不想这么做
It's a hard thing to do.

778
01:57:31,790 --> 01:57:33,876
这是很困难的决定
Difficult decision to make.

779
01:57:37,004 --> 01:57:39,172
你的心不够狠
I don't think you're tough enough.

780
01:57:40,674 --> 01:57:45,679
你心太软了 不够心狠手辣
You're too soft. You're just too softhearted. You're not toughfibred enough.

781
01:57:50,225 --> 01:57:54,187
我的心意已定 没什么好说
Anyway, it's my decision to make. I've already made it.

782
01:57:54,897 --> 01:57:57,399
我不想让我的兄弟送死
I don't like to see my men get killed, sir.

783
01:58:05,657 --> 01:58:08,869
有人曾死在你怀里吗?
Have you ever had anyone die in your arms, sir?

784
01:58:08,952 --> 01:58:11,246
有吗?
Have you?

785
01:58:23,884 --> 01:58:26,845
我不想引起事端
I don't see any reason to make a scandal out of this.

786
01:58:26,929 --> 01:58:32,351
也不想在服役记录中留下污点
I don't want it in the records of the battalion. There's no reason for you to have it on yours.

787
01:58:32,434 --> 01:58:36,021
这和能力或胆量无关
This has nothing to do with cowardice or inefficiency.

788
01:58:39,316 --> 01:58:41,610
看看这座丛林
Look at this jungle.

789
01:58:41,693 --> 01:58:47,032
那些藤蔓缠绕着大树 吞食一切
Look at those vines, the way they twine around the trees, swallowing everything.

790
01:58:49,451 --> 01:58:51,745
大自然很残酷
Nature's cruel, Staros.

791
01:59:01,004 --> 01:59:06,551
你可以申请调到华府的军法局
I'm going to let you apply for reassignment to the Judge Advocate General Corps

792
01:59:06,635 --> 01:59:08,512
就说你生了病
for reasons of ill health.

793
01:59:08,595 --> 01:59:09,972
你是律师
You're a lawyer.

794
01:59:10,055 --> 01:59:12,432
你得过虐疾吗?  没有
You had malaria yet?  No, I haven't.

795
01:59:12,516 --> 01:59:14,893
无所谓 我会安排的
Doesn't matter. I can fix that.

796
01:59:14,977 --> 01:59:17,229
反正你会染上的
Anyway, you probably will have it.

797
01:59:17,896 --> 01:59:20,983
我也会推荐你获颁银星勋章
I'm also recommending you for the Silver Star.

798
01:59:21,066 --> 01:59:25,237
我一定会让你无法推辞
And I'll recommend it in such a way it definitely won't be refused.

799
01:59:26,154 --> 01:59:28,782
干脆也让你得紫心奖章
Might as well have the Purple Heart, too.

800
01:59:31,451 --> 01:59:33,120
为什么?
Why?

801
01:59:33,203 --> 01:59:38,834
因为你脸上的疤 和手上的伤口
Because of that scratch on your face and because of those cuts on your hands.

802
01:59:38,917 --> 01:59:40,585
给我听好
Listen to me, Staros.

803
01:59:40,669 --> 01:59:44,715
你跟下一批伤兵离开
I think it's best you go back with the next batch of wounded and prisoners.

804
01:59:44,798 --> 01:59:48,593
留下来对你没好处
It is no goddamn good for you to keep hanging around.

805
01:59:48,677 --> 01:59:52,222
这件事不说出去最好
The quieter we keep this, the better it'll be for all.

806
02:00:26,882 --> 02:00:29,134
这是多尔上校的宣布
This is from Colonel Tall.

807
02:00:30,635 --> 02:00:34,139
我们的胜利带来最高的荣耀
"Our victory gives us the highest reasons for pride".

808
02:00:35,223 --> 02:00:38,769
这是窝达康拉尔岛役的转捩点
"It will prove a milestone in the battle for Guadalcanal".

809
02:00:40,103 --> 02:00:45,108
明天师长会亲自来检阅前线
"Tomorrow the division commander will arrive to make an inspection of the line".

810
02:00:45,192 --> 02:00:50,447
接防部队会来换班
"After the inspection we're to be relieved by a battalion of the division's reserve regiment".

811
02:00:51,907 --> 02:00:56,161
我为全营兄弟 争取到一星期的假
"I've secured for the battalion a week's rest off the line".

812
02:01:00,415 --> 02:01:01,875
就这样
That's all.

813
02:02:57,324 --> 02:02:59,409
长夜漫漫
Hours like months.

814
02:03:02,162 --> 02:03:04,247
度日如年
Days like years.

815
02:03:07,584 --> 02:03:09,669
我正值青春年华
Walked into the golden age.

816
02:03:13,632 --> 02:03:16,218
站在新世界的边缘
Stood on the shores of the New World.

817
02:03:27,145 --> 02:03:30,106
我本来想去看你们
I would've come by and paid you guys a visit,

818
02:03:30,190 --> 02:03:31,858
不过...
but...

819
02:03:34,986 --> 02:03:37,614
我想一个人静一下
I just felt like being alone, you know?

820
02:03:39,407 --> 02:03:41,493
是吗?
Yeah?

821
02:03:51,670 --> 02:03:53,755
我们要谢谢你
We wanted to thank you, sir.

822
02:03:57,801 --> 02:04:00,303
要求进行包抄行动
For asking to make that flanking move.

823
02:04:02,389 --> 02:04:04,474
为我们着想
For watching out for us.

824
02:04:06,518 --> 02:04:08,603
让我们团结一致
Keeping us together.

825
02:04:13,775 --> 02:04:15,860
你不该被调走
We're all sorry to see you go.

826
02:04:15,944 --> 02:04:18,113
这不公平
We feel like you got a rotten deal.

827
02:04:20,365 --> 02:04:23,535
我并不同意
Well, I'm not sure that you're right.

828
02:04:26,288 --> 02:04:28,164
最难的是
Tough part is...

829
02:04:30,083 --> 02:04:32,544
不知道这么做有没有用
not knowing if you're doing any good.

830
02:04:34,421 --> 02:04:36,506
这才是最难的
That's the hard part.

831
02:04:38,258 --> 02:04:40,885
不过无所谓 我不在乎
But it doesn't matter. I don't care.

832
02:04:41,720 --> 02:04:43,805
我很高兴能离开
I'm glad to be going.

833
02:04:45,056 --> 02:04:47,017
真的很高兴
I'm glad.

834
02:04:47,100 --> 02:04:50,895
还是能提出申诉  为什么?
There's still time. We could file a complaint.  For what?

835
02:04:51,980 --> 02:04:54,232
有什么用?
What good would that do?

836
02:04:55,942 --> 02:04:57,610
反正我想走
Anyway, I wanna go.

837
02:05:00,530 --> 02:05:02,991
别管它 算了吧
Leave it alone. Let it lay.

838
02:05:08,888 --> 02:05:11,217
(希腊语)


839
02:05:15,587 --> 02:05:17,672
什么意思?
What does that mean, sir?

840
02:05:20,383 --> 02:05:22,719
你们像是我的孩子
It means "You've been like my sons".

841
02:05:33,980 --> 02:05:36,066
你们是我的孩子
You are my sons.

842
02:05:37,317 --> 02:05:39,402
我亲爱的孩子
My dear sons.

843
02:05:43,323 --> 02:05:45,408
你们活在我心中
You live inside me now.

844
02:05:49,412 --> 02:05:51,498
永远与我同在
I'll carry you wherever I go.

845
02:06:07,514 --> 02:06:10,308
我忘不了战争的可怕
Can't nothing make you forget it.

846
02:06:14,020 --> 02:06:16,523
悲剧不断重演
Each time you start from scratch.

847
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:24,948
战争不能给我们荣耀
War don't ennoble men.

848
02:06:25,990 --> 02:06:28,284
只会把人变成野狗
It turns 'em into dogs.

849
02:06:34,082 --> 02:06:36,167
荼毒我们的心灵
Poisons the soul.

850
02:07:40,148 --> 02:07:42,233
亲爱的妻子
My dear wife,

851
02:07:44,986 --> 02:07:51,576
战争的丑陋和血腥暴力 会让人丧失良知
you get something twisted out of your insides by all this blood, filth, and noise.

852
02:08:01,044 --> 02:08:03,671
我很想保持纯真
I wanna stay changeless for you.

853
02:08:06,257 --> 02:08:09,260
我想以原来的我回到你身边
I wanna come back to you the man I was before.

854
02:08:17,268 --> 02:08:19,979
我们该如何获得宁静?
How do we get to those other shores?

855
02:08:23,816 --> 02:08:25,902
回到青山绿水间?
To those blue hills.

856
02:08:36,120 --> 02:08:37,789
真爱
Love.

857
02:08:47,340 --> 02:08:49,425
到底来自何方?
Where does it come from?

858
02:08:57,892 --> 02:08:59,978
谁燃起我们心中的爱火?
Who lit this flame in us?

859
02:09:07,026 --> 02:09:09,112
战争无法熄灭它
No war can put it out,

860
02:09:10,613 --> 02:09:12,699
或是征服它
conquer it.

861
02:09:20,540 --> 02:09:22,625
我曾是个囚犯
I was a prisoner.

862
02:09:27,088 --> 02:09:29,173
你让我自由
You set me free.

863
02:09:33,303 --> 02:09:35,847
不管你受过多少训练
No matter how much training you got,

864
02:09:36,973 --> 02:09:39,058
或是多么小心
how careful you are,

865
02:09:40,435 --> 02:09:43,896
只要运气不好就会阵亡
it's a matter of luck whether or not you get killed.

866
02:09:43,980 --> 02:09:49,235
不管你是谁 或是多么骁勇善战
Makes no difference who you are, or how tough a guy you might be,

867
02:09:51,279 --> 02:09:55,700
一不小心就会被杀死
if you're in the wrong spot at the wrong time, you're gonna get it.

868
02:10:06,419 --> 02:10:08,880
我看着那个人死去
I look at that boy dying,

869
02:10:10,381 --> 02:10:12,467
一点感觉都没有
I don't feel nothing.

870
02:10:15,720 --> 02:10:18,389
我对一切都不在乎
I don't care about nothing any more.

871
02:10:23,061 --> 02:10:25,146
听起来很幸福
Sounds like bliss.

872
02:10:29,609 --> 02:10:31,694
我还没有那种感觉
I don't have that feeling yet.

873
02:10:33,112 --> 02:10:35,198
麻木不仁的感觉
That numbness.

874
02:10:36,240 --> 02:10:38,326
我跟你们不一样
Not like the rest of you guys.

875
02:10:42,664 --> 02:10:44,957
也许是因为我看得太多
Maybe cos I knew what to expect.

876
02:10:48,169 --> 02:10:50,421
根本就失去感觉
Maybe I was just frozen up already.

877
02:11:34,215 --> 02:11:37,719
我入伍后就没碰过女人
I haven't touched another woman since I was called up.

878
02:11:38,803 --> 02:11:40,888
或跟女人说过话
Or talked to one.

879
02:11:44,892 --> 02:11:46,978
我不想...
I don't wanna...

880
02:11:47,687 --> 02:11:50,231
我不想有欲念
I don't wanna feel the desire.

881
02:12:27,351 --> 02:12:29,020
亚伯罕
All right. Abrahams!

882
02:12:29,103 --> 02:12:30,772
亚伯罕 你的信
Abrahams. Here you go.

883
02:12:30,855 --> 02:12:32,732
史狄 史狄呢?
Stack! Where's Stack?

884
02:12:32,815 --> 02:12:34,859
叫他来
Bring him out.

885
02:12:34,942 --> 02:12:37,028
比尔?
Bell?

886
02:12:37,111 --> 02:12:38,988
比尔!
Bell!

887
02:12:40,031 --> 02:12:42,533
另一封是比尔的 另一封是比尔的
Another one for Bell. Another one for Bell.

888
02:12:45,286 --> 02:12:47,371
亲爱的积克
Dear Jack,

889
02:12:49,165 --> 02:12:54,337
我认识一个空军上尉 我爱上他
I've met an Air Force captain. I've fallen in love with him.

890
02:12:57,048 --> 02:12:59,342
我要跟你离婚嫁给他
I want a divorce to marry him.

891
02:13:05,681 --> 02:13:09,268
你可以拒绝 但我还是要说
I know you can say no, but I'm asking you anyway,

892
02:13:09,352 --> 02:13:12,146
毕竟我们曾夫妻一场
out of the memory of what we had together.

893
02:13:18,903 --> 02:13:20,988
原谅我
Forgive me.

894
02:13:21,948 --> 02:13:24,534
我太寂寞了
It just got too lonely, Jack.

895
02:13:44,846 --> 02:13:46,931
我们会再见
We'll meet again some day.

896
02:13:50,726 --> 02:13:54,689
我们一定会再见面的
People who have been as close as we've been always meet again.

897
02:14:03,155 --> 02:14:05,992
我无权跟你这么说
I have no right to speak to you this way.

898
02:14:06,075 --> 02:14:08,369
不过我忍不住
I can't stop myself.

899
02:14:08,870 --> 02:14:10,955
习惯成自然
A habit so strong.

900
02:14:13,124 --> 02:14:15,751
你曾是我最好的朋友
Oh, my friend of all those shining years.

901
02:14:19,881 --> 02:14:21,966
帮助我离开你
Help me leave you!

902
02:15:49,061 --> 02:15:51,147
你叫什么?
What's your name?

903
02:17:03,177 --> 02:17:05,263
我们曾是一家人
We were a family.

904
02:17:08,516 --> 02:17:11,102
不得已被拆散
How'd it break up and come apart?

905
02:17:14,355 --> 02:17:17,859
现在我们自相残杀
So that now we're turned against each other.

906
02:17:19,735 --> 02:17:22,321
断送彼此的生路
Each standing in the other's light.

907
02:17:31,539 --> 02:17:34,166
我们怎么会失去善良本性?
How did we lose the good that was given us?

908
02:17:35,960 --> 02:17:38,045
泯灭天理良知
Let it slip away?

909
02:17:40,840 --> 02:17:42,925
将人性弃之不顾
Scatter it careless?

910
02:18:03,613 --> 02:18:06,032
我们为什么无法升华?
What's keeping us from reaching out?

911
02:18:06,657 --> 02:18:08,743
达到光荣的巅峰?
Touching the glory?

912
02:18:10,786 --> 02:18:16,709
如果我是日军你早就死了
I'd have had you, Witt, if you was a Jap,Long ago.

913
02:18:18,294 --> 02:18:20,379
你得留下来?
They leave you here?

914
02:18:21,923 --> 02:18:23,424
对
Yup.

915
02:18:23,507 --> 02:18:25,593
我会拖累他们
I slowed 'em up.

916
02:18:26,260 --> 02:18:28,179
我不介意
Don't mind, really.

917
02:18:29,180 --> 02:18:31,974
医官帮我包扎得很好
The medic fixed me up pretty good.

918
02:18:32,099 --> 02:18:34,185
我有很多弹药
I got plenty of ammo.

919
02:18:36,854 --> 02:18:39,482
一定会有人来接我
Somebody'll be along for me eventually.

920
02:18:44,570 --> 02:18:46,864
你伤不轻  膝盖中弹
They got you good.  Right in the knee.

921
02:18:46,948 --> 02:18:48,658
是啊
Yeah.

922
02:18:48,741 --> 02:18:51,327
我不必再打仗了 威特
I'm out of this war for good, Witt.

923
02:18:56,624 --> 02:19:00,211
你在这儿干嘛?  只是 你知道
What you doin' down here?  Just, you know,

924
02:19:00,294 --> 02:19:02,588
我要回到连上
I'm heading back to the company.

925
02:19:03,255 --> 02:19:04,924
好
Yeah.

926
02:19:05,758 --> 02:19:08,052
跟大伙儿问好
Well, you give all them boys my best.

927
02:19:08,135 --> 02:19:10,596
你可以跟我来
You can come with me if you want.

928
02:19:10,680 --> 02:19:12,807
我扶你
I'll help you along.

929
02:19:14,433 --> 02:19:17,019
不了 这里很好
No, it's nice and quiet.

930
02:19:17,103 --> 02:19:19,188
很安静
Peaceful up here.

931
02:19:21,565 --> 02:19:24,735
我会拖累你 剖队会接我
I'd just slow you up. There'll be somebody along.

932
02:19:28,614 --> 02:19:30,700
我会提醒他们
I'll remind 'em.

933
02:19:31,158 --> 02:19:33,244
好
OK.

934
02:21:08,464 --> 02:21:10,549
嘿 威特
Hey, Witt.

935
02:21:15,096 --> 02:21:17,264
今天你惹了什么麻烦?
Who you making trouble for today?

936
02:21:18,307 --> 02:21:20,393
什么意思?
What d'you mean?

937
02:21:21,143 --> 02:21:24,313
你不是最爱惹麻烦吗?
Well, isn't that what you like to do?

938
02:21:24,397 --> 02:21:27,066
叫你向左你偏偏向右
Turn left when they say go right?

939
02:21:33,906 --> 02:21:36,408
你为什么这么爱惹麻烦?
Why are you such a troublemaker, Witt?

940
02:21:38,828 --> 02:21:41,372
你很关心我 对吧?
You care about me, don't you, Sergeant?

941
02:21:42,748 --> 02:21:44,834
我一直都这么觉得
I always felt like you did.

942
02:21:46,669 --> 02:21:49,380
你为什么装得冷酷无情?
Why do you always make yourself out like a rock?

943
02:21:50,673 --> 02:21:53,050
有时我跟你聊得很愉快
One day I can come up and talk to you,

944
02:21:54,093 --> 02:21:57,972
隔一天 我们就像没见过面似的
by the next day it's like we never even met.

945
02:22:12,319 --> 02:22:14,405
好孤单的房子
Lonely house now.

946
02:22:17,074 --> 02:22:19,160
你会觉得孤单吗?
You ever get lonely?

947
02:22:19,243 --> 02:22:21,328
只有在人群中
Only around people.

948
02:22:23,247 --> 02:22:25,332
只有在人群中
Only around people.

949
02:22:29,962 --> 02:22:33,382
你还是有美好的信念 对吧?
You still believing in the beautiful light, are you?

950
02:22:40,973 --> 02:22:43,058
你怎么办得到?
How do you do that?

951
02:22:44,727 --> 02:22:46,812
你就像是魔术师
You're a magician to me.

952
02:22:55,863 --> 02:22:57,948
你眼中仍有一丝良知
I still see a spark in you.

953
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:28,547
有人看到死去小鸟的眼中 只有无言的痛楚
One man looks at a dying bird and thinks there's nothing but unanswered pain.

954
02:23:31,258 --> 02:23:33,343
不过死亡是无情的
But death's got the final word.

955
02:23:36,430 --> 02:23:38,515
死神在嘲笑他
It's laughing at him.

956
02:23:47,816 --> 02:23:50,318
有人看着同一只小鸟
Another man sees that same bird,

957
02:23:53,238 --> 02:23:55,324
却看到生命光辉
feels the glory.

958
02:24:00,370 --> 02:24:02,873
心中充满喜悦
Feels something smiling through him.

959
02:25:00,222 --> 02:25:02,682
我们得马上撤退
We need to get out of here right now.

960
02:25:02,766 --> 02:25:07,354
你跟指挥部说过吗?  没有
You explain to... headquarters the situation?  No.

961
02:25:07,437 --> 02:25:11,525
他们知道我们在这儿吗?
Do they know where we are? Cos we're sitting ducks out here.

962
02:25:12,692 --> 02:25:16,238
我们死定了 这要由我决定
Well, I think that's... up to me to judge, Sergeant.

963
02:25:17,864 --> 02:25:23,453
我们得派人去看敌军有多近 好吗?
I think we just need to send somebody up there and find out how close they are. OK?

964
02:25:23,537 --> 02:25:25,414
很容易
It's easy.

965
02:25:25,497 --> 02:25:28,875
韦特 联络指挥部
Hey, Weld... get headquarters on that thing.

966
02:25:28,959 --> 02:25:30,877
炮声越来越近
The fire's coming closer, sir.

967
02:25:30,961 --> 02:25:32,003
没有讯号
Line's cut!

968
02:25:35,006 --> 02:25:39,177
我们得派人查出原因
We need to send somebody out there to find out where that line is being cut.

969
02:25:39,261 --> 02:25:41,888
和敌人有多近
And we need to find out how close they are.

970
02:25:41,972 --> 02:25:43,515
来吧
Come on.

971
02:25:43,598 --> 02:25:46,143
好吧 好吧
OK. OK.

972
02:25:50,272 --> 02:25:52,357
嘿 你
Hey, you.

973
02:25:52,983 --> 02:25:54,234
你去
You go.

974
02:25:55,235 --> 02:25:56,903
费夫 你要去
You're going, Fife.

975
02:26:02,534 --> 02:26:05,537
古恩 你也去
Coombs. You go, too.

976
02:26:05,620 --> 02:26:07,289
快点
Come on!

977
02:26:07,372 --> 02:26:11,918
我也去 这整个任务都不对
I'll go. I want you to know I think the whole thing's a bad idea, though.

978
02:26:12,002 --> 02:26:17,048
要是他们全力进攻 我们肯定没命
If they come down here in any strength, Lieutenant, they'll knock our position to hell.

979
02:26:17,132 --> 02:26:19,593
你不必去 别人会去
You don't have to go. Others'll volunteer.

980
02:26:19,676 --> 02:26:24,806
我想要去 万一出事我要在场
No, I wanna go, sir. In case something bad happens, I wanna be there.

981
02:26:24,890 --> 02:26:27,392
好吧 顺着河走
All right. You stay by the river.

982
02:26:27,476 --> 02:26:30,395
丛林很浓密 小心点
That jungle's too thick. And be very careful.

983
02:26:30,478 --> 02:26:32,564
我会的
I will.

984
02:26:32,647 --> 02:26:34,608
祝好运 威特
Good luck, Witt.

985
02:26:34,691 --> 02:26:36,818
费夫 你没事吧?
You OK, Fife?

986
02:28:03,989 --> 02:28:06,616
敌军的增援部队
A reinforce battalion.

987
02:28:08,201 --> 02:28:09,869
我们得回去
We need to go back.

988
02:28:09,953 --> 02:28:11,830
告诉连长
Tell the lieutenant.

989
02:28:15,625 --> 02:28:17,502
走吧
Let's go.

990
02:28:34,769 --> 02:28:36,855
我中弹了
I'm hit!

991
02:29:35,789 --> 02:29:38,583
有人得留下来阻挡敌军
One of us needs to stay here and hold 'em off.

992
02:29:45,715 --> 02:29:47,801
我们不会有事的
We'll be all right.

993
02:29:52,806 --> 02:29:55,809
我的朋友活不久了
My friend here doesn't have long,

994
02:29:55,892 --> 02:29:58,812
你们回去吧
so... you go.

995
02:30:00,021 --> 02:30:01,481
快去吧
You go on ahead.

996
02:30:24,713 --> 02:30:26,798
威特
Witt!

997
02:31:12,635 --> 02:31:14,721
他们来了
They're coming.

998
02:31:16,181 --> 02:31:19,517
我得走了 你不要
I gotta go. I don't want you to be afraid.

999
02:31:20,268 --> 02:31:24,439
听到枪声就躲起来 然后再顺着河走下去
Just hide out here till you hear firing, then push on down the river.

1000
02:31:24,522 --> 02:31:25,982
不
No.

1001
02:32:06,231 --> 02:32:09,901
古恩呢?  快撤退 敌人来了
Where's Coombs?  Get back. Get back, they're coming.

1002
02:32:10,860 --> 02:32:12,946
撤退
Fall back.

1003
02:32:14,447 --> 02:32:16,991
威特呢? 费夫 威特在哪儿?
Where's Witt? Fife, where's Witt?

1004
02:32:23,206 --> 02:32:25,291
费夫 威特呢?
Fife, where's Witt?

1005
02:32:29,003 --> 02:32:32,006
威特在哪儿?
Fife. Fife, where's Witt?

1006
02:33:19,006 --> 02:33:20,835
(日语)


1007
02:37:06,200 --> 02:37:08,286
你的生命光辉呢?
Where's your spark now?

1008
02:37:31,058 --> 02:37:35,146
我知道你们在喝私酿酒
Now, I know you men have been making and drinking this goddamn swipe.

1009
02:37:35,229 --> 02:37:36,480
没关系
That's OK by me.

1010
02:37:36,564 --> 02:37:38,274
一切都是谎言...
Everything a lie.

1011
02:37:38,357 --> 02:37:42,028
在我的部队可以尽管喝酒
Any man in my outfit can get as drunk as he wants to every night.

1012
02:37:42,111 --> 02:37:44,238
...你见到和听到的一切
Everything you hear and see.

1013
02:37:44,322 --> 02:37:48,492
只要能执行任务就没问题
As long as he's in shape to make reveille and carry out any assignment given.

1014
02:37:48,576 --> 02:37:52,455
要是不行...他就会有麻烦
If he can't do that, he's gonna have trouble from me.

1015
02:37:52,538 --> 02:37:56,375
他们都在说谎  我是个注重家庭的人
So much to spew out.  I prefer to think of myself as a family man,

1016
02:37:56,459 --> 02:37:59,670
大家才会在一起
and that's what we all are here, whether we like it or not.

1017
02:37:59,754 --> 02:38:01,839
我们是一家人
We are a family.

1018
02:38:02,924 --> 02:38:05,092
我是父亲
I'm the father.

1019
02:38:05,760 --> 02:38:08,846
副连长就是母亲
Guess that makes Sergeant Welsh here the mother.

1020
02:38:08,929 --> 02:38:11,641
他们一个接一个来
They just keep coming, one after another.

1021
02:38:11,724 --> 02:38:15,019
你们都是我的孩子
That makes you all the children in this family.

1022
02:38:15,102 --> 02:38:18,648
一家之主是父亲
Now, a family can have only one head, and that is the father.

1023
02:38:18,731 --> 02:38:23,402
男主外女主内 这就是规矩
Father's the head, mother runs it. That's the way it's gonna work here.

1024
02:38:23,486 --> 02:38:27,198
要是你们想见我  我们被困在棺材里
If any of you wanna see me about anything,  You're in a box.

1025
02:38:27,281 --> 02:38:29,408
只要有任何事  移动的棺材
anything at all,  A moving box.

1026
02:38:29,492 --> 02:38:31,577
我都会在
you will find that I am available.

1027
02:38:31,661 --> 02:38:34,622
战争在圣诞节前不会结束
This war is not gonna be over by next Christmas.

1028
02:38:34,705 --> 02:38:37,667
还要很久才能回家
It's gonna be a long time before we get home...

1029
02:38:37,750 --> 02:38:39,835
他们要我们牺牲
They want you dead.

1030
02:38:42,213 --> 02:38:44,298
或相信他们的谎言
Or in their lie.

1031
02:38:49,512 --> 02:38:51,597
我们只有一个办法
Only one thing a man can do.

1032
02:38:54,600 --> 02:38:56,686
找到自己的出路
Find something that's his.

1033
02:38:59,939 --> 02:39:02,024
逃到属于自己的小岛
Make an island for himself.

1034
02:39:15,496 --> 02:39:17,998
我这一生若不相信上帝
If I never meet you in this life,

1035
02:39:19,417 --> 02:39:21,502
将会有所缺憾
Let me feel the lack.

1036
02:39:30,052 --> 02:39:34,473
上帝怜悯我 我就属于他
A glance from your eyes, and my life will be yours.

1037
02:40:23,606 --> 02:40:27,651
我只期望有一天能回家
Somethin' I can come back to. Some kind of foundation.

1038
02:40:27,818 --> 02:40:32,406
我不知道你有何打算 但...
I mean, I don't know what, you know, what your plans are, but...

1039
02:40:32,490 --> 02:40:36,494
吃了这么多苦 我已经觉悟
I'm determined now. I've been through the thick and thin of it.

1040
02:40:36,577 --> 02:40:39,914
我还年轻 不过经历苦难
You know, I may be young, but I've lived plenty of life.

1041
02:40:40,623 --> 02:40:42,875
我准备好好活下去
I'm ready to start living it good.

1042
02:40:42,958 --> 02:40:47,922
我爸常说 苦尽甘来
You know, my daddy always told me it's gonna get a lot worse before it gets better.

1043
02:40:48,005 --> 02:40:52,551
年轻人的日子不应该那么苦
You know, cos life ain't supposed to be that hard when you're young.

1044
02:40:52,635 --> 02:40:56,305
我猜最苦的已经熬过去了
Well, I figure after this the worst is gonna be gone.

1045
02:40:57,014 --> 02:41:00,601
往后会渐入佳境 这是我的愿望
It's time for things to get better. That's what I want.

1046
02:41:01,602 --> 02:41:03,687
一定能够实现
That's what's gonna happen.

1047
02:41:04,814 --> 02:41:06,899
我长大了
I'm getting older now.

1048
02:41:07,733 --> 02:41:10,236
我变得比较成熟
By no means old, but older.

1049
02:41:11,028 --> 02:41:14,198
我们曾经在哪里一起渡过
Where is it that we were together?

1050
02:41:17,368 --> 02:41:19,662
你们曾跟我一起生活
Who were you that I lived with?

1051
02:41:24,375 --> 02:41:26,460
你们是什么人? 
Walked with?

1052
02:41:33,592 --> 02:41:35,678
是兄弟
The brother.

1053
02:41:42,184 --> 02:41:44,270
也是朋友
The friend.

1054
02:42:10,588 --> 02:42:12,673
黑暗和光明
Darkness from light.

1055
02:42:14,175 --> 02:42:16,260
仇恨和爱
Strife from love.

1056
02:42:17,428 --> 02:42:20,556
全都来自同一个心灵
Are they the workings of one mind?

1057
02:42:21,932 --> 02:42:24,685
拥有同一张脸孔吗?
The features of the same face?

1058
02:42:39,575 --> 02:42:41,660
我的灵魂
Oh, my soul,

1059
02:42:43,287 --> 02:42:45,372
让我相信上帝
Let me be in you now.

1060
02:42:51,420 --> 02:42:53,714
透过我的双眼观看世界
Look out through my eyes.

1061
02:42:55,007 --> 02:42:57,509
看着您创造的万物
Look out at the things you made.

1062
02:43:02,431 --> 02:43:04,725
散发生命光辉
All things shining.
