00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:19,090
细 细 的 红 线(The Thin  Red  Line)

4
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,750
世上为何有这么多战争?
What's this war in the heart of nature?

5
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,840
万物为何自相残杀?
Why does nature vie with itself?

6
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,630
陆地和海洋为何互相对抗?
The land contend with the sea?

7
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,770
大自然是否充满仇恨?
Is there an avenging power in nature?

8
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,310
善恶是否同时存在?
Not one power, but two?

9
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,680
我记得我母亲临终前
I remember my mother when she was dying.

10
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,100
脸色苍白 形如槁木
Looked all shrunk up and grey.

11
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,560
我问她害不害怕?
I asked her if she was afraid.

12
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,360
她只是摇摇头
She just shook her head.

13
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,570
我不敢面对她的死亡
I was afraid to touch the death seen in her.

14
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:39,320
也不觉得她蒙主荣召是一件好事
I couldn't find nothing beautiful or up lifting about her going back to God.

15
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:46,760
听说精神能永垂不朽 不过我没见过
I heard people talk about immortality, but I ain't seen it.

16
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,650
不知道我死时会怎样
I wondered how it'd be when I died.

17
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,700
当你知道那是最后一口气不知道是什么感觉
What it'd be like to know that this breath now was the last one you was ever gonna draw.

18
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,170
我希望能和她一样坦然面对
I just hope I can meet it the same way she did.

19
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,960
跟她一样...平静
With the same... calm.

20
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:23,640
当心灵得到平静精神就能永垂不朽
Cos that's where it's hidden - the immortality I hadn't seen.

21
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,390
这里的小孩不会打架
Kids around here never fight.

22
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,930
有时候会
Sometimes.

23
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,020
他们在玩耍的时候
Sometimes when you see them playing

24
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,270
总是会打架
they always fight!

25
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,740
- 他怕我吗? - 有一点
- Is she afraid of me? - Little bit.

26
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,490
- 你怕我吗? - 怕
- Are you afraid of me? - Yes.

27
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,700
- 为什么? - 因为你看起来...
- Why? - Cos you look...

28
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,120
...像是个军人
You look as an army!

29
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,290
- 我像军人? - 对
- I look army? - Yes.

30
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,130
无所谓
Well, that don't matter.

31
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,930
这不重要
It doesn't matter.

32
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,470
- 孩子累了 - 对
- Baby's tired. - Yes.

33
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,520
他游累了就会睡
If she swims, she wants, she will sleep.

34
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,420
好 来
All right, come on. Turn around.

35
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,590
快...快...快
Go, go, go, go. Go!

36
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,510
快点...快点...
Come on, go.

37
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,520
快 快 快
Go, go, go, go!

38
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:17,200
威特 是美军的巡逻艇
Witt, patrol boat!She's American.

39
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,180
它怎么会单独出现?
What's it doing out here all alone?

40
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,000
威特 你一点都没变
You haven't changed at all, have you, Witt?

41
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,370
什么也没学到
You haven't learned a thing.

42
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:08,710
当别人信任你你就肯为他赴汤蹈火
All a man has to do is leave it to you, you'll put your head in the noose for him.

43
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,180
你逃过几年兵?
How many times you been AWOL?

44
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,890
你当兵六年了
Been in the army, what? Six years now?

45
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,980
如果要学聪明
Ain't it time you smartened up and stopped being such a punk recruit?

46
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,150
现在该是时候了
I mean, if you're ever gonna.

47
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,320
我们不能都当聪明人
We can't all be smart.

48
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,410
没错 真可惜
No, we can't, and that's a shame.

49
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,580
看看你
Look at you.

50
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,540
你在我的连队不能乖乖服役
Truth is, you can't take straight duty in my company.

51
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,510
你在这世上不能成为 一个好的军人
You'll never be a real soldier, not in God's world.

52
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,890
这是C连 我是副连长
This is C Company, of which I'm First Sergeant. I run this outfit.

53
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:02,810
史塔洛上尉是连长 这里是我话事 任何人都不可以违抗
Captain Staros, he's the CO, but I'm the guy who runs it. Nobody's gonna foul that up.

54
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,730
你只是一张吃饭的嘴
You're just another mouth for me to feed.

55
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,110
你本来要接受军事审判
Normally, you'd be court-martialled.

56
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,700
算你好运
But I worked a deal for ya.

57
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,870
我给你另作安排
Gotta consider yourself lucky.

58
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:22,160
我派你到纪律部队
I'm sending you to a disciplinary outfit.

59
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,670
当担架兵 照顾伤兵
You'll be a stretcher-bearer. You'll be taking care of the wounded.

60
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,960
我能接受任何处罚
I can take anything you dish out.

61
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,380
我一个人就比你好两倍
I'm twice the man you are.

62
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,940
在这个世界里
In this world...

63
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,690
一个人根本微不足道
a man himself is nothing.

64
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,410
只有这一个世界
And there ain't no world but this one.

65
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,200
你错了 副连长
You're wrong there, Top.

66
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,080
我见过另一个世界
I seen another world.

67
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,550
有时候我觉得这只是我的想像
Sometimes I think it was just... my imagination.

68
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,060
好
Well,

69
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,850
我和你的看法不同
then you've seen things I never will.

70
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:41,030
这个世界在自我毁灭
We're living in a world that's blowing itself to hell as fast as everybody can arrange it.

71
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:46,960
你只以只眼开只眼闭
In a situation like that all a man can do is shut his eyes and let nothing touch him.

72
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,120
为自己着想
Look out for himself.

73
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,100
我可能是你最好的朋友
I might be the best friend you ever had.

74
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,390
你自己都不知道
You don't even know it.

75
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,260
他憎死你了
He hates you worse than poison.

76
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,520
我不觉得他憎我 因为我不憎他
I never felt he hated me, cos I don't hate him.

77
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,560
我爱C队的兄弟
I love Charlie Company.

78
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,610
他们是我的家人
They're my people.

79
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,390
这个岛叫"顽石"
They call it "The Rock".

80
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:10,720
原本无人占领 后来让日军盖了机场
Nobody wants this island. Japs just put an airfield there.

81
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,680
主要战区在这里
Fighting's confined to this area.

82
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:18,360
这是攻击澳洲的途径亦是进攻美国的海道
This is their road to Australia, and this is their way of controlling the sea lanes to America.

83
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,650
若要阻止日军攻占南太平洋 就得在这里开战
If we're gonna stop the Japs' advance into the South Pacific, we've gotta do it right there.

84
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,240
海军陆战队已经试过 现在轮到我们
The Marines have done their job. Now it's our turn.

85
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,790
我们将奋不顾身
Worked my ass off.

86
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,420
尽量迎合将军
Brown-nosed the generals.

87
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,750
降低身份
Degraded myself

88
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,800
为他们 为我家人
for them and my family.

89
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,180
和我的家
For my home.

90
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,140
- 我很敬佩你 上校 - 谢谢你 长官
- I admire you, Colonel. I do. - Thank you, sir.

91
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,190
你这年纪的军官早已退休了
Most men your age would have retired by now.

92
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,350
你是好军人
It's OK.

93
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:02,070
部队需要你这种成熟的长官
We need general officers with maturity and character like you.

94
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:05,530
我们有好的中士和中校
We've got good sergeants and good lieutenant colonels.

95
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:08,990
他们一当了上校 就想做将军
But once a man gets those eagles, he can't wait to get that star.

96
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,160
于是成为政客
He becomes a politician, right?

97
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,330
只会拍上司的马屁
Goes along to get along.

98
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:18,040
很难坚持原则
So goddamn hard to stay upright.

99
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,170
- 你说得对 长官 - 上将会注意我的表现
- You said it there, sir. - With the Admiral watching, which he will be.

100
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,170
- 一定有人盯着你 - 嗯
- There's always someone watching. - Yeah.

101
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,220
像只猎鹰
Like a hawk.

102
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,470
总是有人想抢你的功劳
Always someone ready to jump in, if you're not.

103
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,900
- 你有儿子吗 上校? - 有的 长官
- D'you have a son, Colonel? - Yes, sir.

104
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:50,410
很好 不能让子孙打这场烂仗
Good. We don't want our sons or grandsons fighting this war 30 years from now, do we?

105
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:54,040
- 没错 是不能 - 那就全力攻敌
- No, sir, we sure don't. - Then you crush 'em without mercy.

106
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,160
把敌人赶尽杀绝 抢下机场
You dig them out of the hills and protect that airfield.

107
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,120
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

108
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:05,380
你有没有想过日军为何在这儿盖机场?
You wonder why... Why did the Japs put an airfield there of all places?

109
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,550
我们对大局不太清楚
I guess we don't know the bigger picture, if there is such a thing.

110
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,720
- 你认为呢? - 我从不想这种问题
- What do you think? - Well, sir, I never ask myself that question.

111
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,470
你很谦虚
You're a humble man.

112
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,810
没人要这座岛...除了你
Nobody wants that island... but you.

113
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,400
你有多大的决心?
How much do you want it?

114
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,900
我会全力以赴
As much as I have to, sir.

115
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,820
家人为我做的牺牲
All they sacrificed for me

116
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:38,620
就像覆水难收
poured out like water on the ground.

117
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,340
我本来能好好爱他们
All I might have given for love's sake.

118
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,940
太迟了
Too late.

119
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,860
我的心已死
Died...

120
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,370
像树木一样慢慢凋零
slow as a tree.

121
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,700
你感觉得到吗?
D'you feel it?

122
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,500
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

123
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,710
谢谢你 长官
Thank you, sir.

124
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,700
权力越大 恐惧越深
The closer you are to Caesar, the greater the fear.

125
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:13,010
我就是感到害怕
I just can't help how damn scared I am, sarge, all right?

126
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,720
无法控制
I can't help it. I got...

127
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,180
小时候我继父常用砖块打我
My stepdaddy took a block and beat me when I was real little

128
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,060
我好怕 老是躲起来
and I was scared and I used to run, I used to hide.

129
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,810
时常睡在鸡窝
Hell, I slept in the chicken coop a whole lot of nights.

130
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,070
我以为我不会再害怕
And I never thought it'd get no worse than that.

131
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,200
但是现在我分秒都在害怕
But I'm living by the... by the minute here. I'm counting the seconds.

132
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,740
马上就要登陆一定会遭到空袭
Hell, we're gonna be landing soon and there's gonna be air raids.

133
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:43,290
我们会阵亡在滩头
We're probably gonna die before we get off the beach.

134
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:47,380
这艘船就像漂流的坟墓
This place is... It's like a big floating graveyard.

135
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,670
- 你叫什么 小子? - 我退伍后想买一辆车
- What's your name, kid? - I wanna own an automobile when I get out.

136
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,930
- 你叫什么? - 爱德华崔恩
- What's your name? - Edward, Edward B Train.

137
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,090
崔恩?
Train?

138
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:02,600
只有上帝和死亡是永恒的
The only things that are permanent is, is dying and the Lord. That's it.

139
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:08,600
我只担心这些 这场战争不是你我的终点
That's all you gotta worry about. This war ain't... gonna be the end of me or you neither.

140
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:12,020
- 会遇到空袭吗? - 我怎么知道?
- Think we'll catch an air raid? - How in the hell should I know?

141
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:16,860
别的大兵说上次进攻就没有
All's I know are them crew guys said they didn't catch no air raid the last time.

142
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:20,530
上上一次他们差点被炸死
On the other hand, time before last they nearly got blew up.

143
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,490
你要我怎么说
What d'you want me to tell you?

144
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,620
多谢了 你什么也没说
You're a big help, Tills. Nothing. Tell me nothing.

145
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,170
不过我要告诉你
Tell you something.

146
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:31,840
我们在船上就像是死鸭子
We're sitting out here on this ocean like a couple of fuckin' ducks in these boats.

147
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,880
我早就知道
I already know that.

148
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,720
好好想一想 提奥
Well, brood on it, Tills.

149
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,090
好好地想
Brood on it.

150
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,600
- 不看好戏吗? - 没兴趣
- Ain't you watching the fun? - I ain't interested.

151
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:46,140
- 太迫了 - 就算不迫我也不想看
- Yeah, I guess it is pretty crowded. - Wouldn't be interested, even if it wasn't.

152
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:49,020
我要去拿那把手枪
Well, I'm on my way to get me that pistol.

153
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,770
是吗? 开心点
Yeah? Well, have fun.

154
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,070
是啊 开心点
Yeah, have fun.

155
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:57,990
有手枪才能对付日本武士刀
You'll wish you had one once we get ashore and run into some of them samurai sabres.

156
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:01,700
快开门 给我开门...
Open this door! Open this goddamn door!

157
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,660
快开门
Open the door!

158
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:29,270
我入伍时没想到会有这下场
I never bargained for nothing like this when I signed up for this man's army before the war.

159
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:34,150
我怎么知道会打仗? 你倒是说说
How was I supposed to know there was gonna be a fuckin' war, huh? Answer me that.

160
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,110
我只知道C连最衰了
All I know is Charlie Company's always getting screwed. Always.

161
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,950
我也知道是谁的错
And I can tell you whose fault it is, too.

162
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,990
就是我们的连长
It's that captain of ours.

163
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,870
他害大家被派上这艘鬼船
First he gets us stuck off on this boat where we don't know a fucking soul.

164
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,420
而且是第四批登陆部队
Then he gets us stuck way down in fourth place on the list to get off this son of a bitch.

165
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,190
连长 你好
Hello, Captain.

166
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:59,900
档案说你在战前是军官
I read in your 201 file that you were an officer before the war.

167
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,650
怎么会变成二等兵?
How'd you end up a private?

168
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,820
因为我太太
Cos of my wife.

169
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,780
我本来在工兵部队
I was in the corps of engineers.

170
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,040
我和她从来没分开过
We'd never been separated before,

171
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,210
连一晚都没有
not even for a night.

172
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:19,050
我忍受了四个月最后终于放弃
I took it for four months and then I quit.

173
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,050
辞职不干
Just resigned.

174
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:26,760
我被送回美国
They sent me back to the States.

175
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,930
永远不能当军官
They told me I'd never get another commission.

176
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:35,690
他们说要徵召我入伍让我当步兵
They said they'd see to it I got drafted and that I for damn sure'd be in the infantry.

177
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,400
那些浑蛋
Sons of bitches.

178
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,110
我不怪他们
No, I don't blame them.

179
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,610
她在哪里?
Well, where is she now?

180
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,570
在家里
She's home.

181
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,380
我并不怕死
Why should i be afraid to die?

182
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,470
因为我已属于你
I belong to you.

183
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,560
快...快...快...
Move! Move! Move!

184
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,730
快 快
Move! Move!

185
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,110
快点...
Move! Move!

186
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,440
快 快
Moving out!

187
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:29,700
如果我先走 我会等你的
If i go first, I'll wait for you there.

188
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,450
就在死亡的另一边
On the otherside of the dark waters.

189
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,840
贝尔 戴上头盔
Put your helmet on.

190
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,050
你与我同在
Be with me now.

191
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,600
- 压力很大 对吧? - 是的 长官
- Feeling the pressure, Captain? - Yes, sir.

192
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,270
我喜欢你 上尉
I like you, Captain.

193
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:07,860
我要你知道我很支持你
And I just want you to know, well, we're in this thing together. All right?

194
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:12,030
你先逼近敌区 我会赶上来
Keep pressing inland till you reach the line. I'll catch up with you there.

195
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,990
- 是的 长官 - 由你全权指挥
- Yes, sir. - It's all yours, Captain.

196
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,540
让开 让开
Gangway! Gangway there!

197
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,080
我要过去
Coming through!

198
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,080
班长马上报到
Squad leaders! Both teams!

199
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:23,500
在这里
This way, son. This way, right here.

200
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,630
准备上登陆船
Stand by to go over the side!

201
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,440
我们在天上的父
Our Father, who art in heaven...

202
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,320
免我们的债如同我们免人的债
And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.

203
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,030
国度权柄荣耀全是您的 阿们
For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory.

204
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,800
你们很幸运
Your outfit's lucky.

205
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,970
运输船刚被日军发现
Transports must've been spotted.

206
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,970
幸好你们下来了
You're getting outta here just ahead of time.

207
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,860
深呼吸 你得深呼吸
Take a breath, mister. You gotta breathe!

208
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,680
- 这是C连吗? - 是的
- You Charlie Company? - Yeah.

209
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,850
我们深入内陆一英里 什么也没有
We went in a mile. Nothing there.

210
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,480
一个礼拜都没动静
Some oil drums. There'd be nothing there for...

211
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,940
- 一个礼拜 - 一个礼拜 长官
- A week. - A week, sir.

212
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,480
无人伤亡 日军大概都跑了
No casualties. Japs must've hauled ass.

213
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,610
我们受迫击炮攻击 无人伤亡
Two mortars hit the beach, but most guys came in standing up.

214
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,570
这地方很不可思议
Darnedest thing I ever did see.

215
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,620
还有鱼住在树上
They got fish that live in trees.

216
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,790
指挥部好像没搞清楚状况
If they didn't know this beach was deserted, what else don't they know?

217
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:56,800
您化身为宇宙万物
Who are you to live in all these many forms?

218
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:31,300
万物皆难逃一死
Your death that captures all.

219
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,640
您也是生命的泉源
You, too, are the source of all that's gonna be born.

220
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,870
您充满荣耀
Your glory.

221
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:13,250
慈悲
Mercy.

222
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,880
宁静
Peace.

223
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,930
真理
Truth.

224
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,850
您能安抚人心
You give calm a spirit,

225
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,980
给人们谅解
understanding,

226
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,860
和勇气
courage.

227
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,620
使人得到满足
The contented heart.

228
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,010
医务兵 这里
Get a medic here!

229
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:37,810
也许每个人都有共同的灵魂 和相同的命运
Maybe all men got one big soul who everybody's a part of.

230
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,020
每张脸孔都是同一个人
All faces of the same man.

231
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,360
一个大我
One big self.

232
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,690
每个人都想获得救赎
Everyone looking for salvation by himself.

233
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:35,030
像炭火般燃烧生命
Each like a coal drawn from the fire.

234
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,900
我们要攻上那座山头
We're going straight up that hill there.

235
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:17,660
- 办不到 上校 - 我们无法包抄敌军
- We can't do that, Colonel. - Well, there's no way to outflank it.

236
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:20,660
左边的悬崖底下是河流
On the left is a cliff that falls down into the river.

237
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:24,540
日军守住丛林 我们得正面突袭
The Japanese hold the jungle. It has to be taken frontally.

238
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:29,670
食水怎么办? 山上没清水
What about water, sir? It's not getting up here.

239
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,170
我的兄弟都因为脱水昏倒
My men are... passing out, sir.

240
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:43,850
他们能发牢骚就能打仗
Only time you worry about a soldier is when he stops bitching.

241
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,370
并肩前进 第三排留守
We're all gonna attack abreast. Third Platoon in reserve.

242
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:04,830
我们得越过三个山丘
We've gotta cross those three folds of ground. You see?

243
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,710
然后再攻下山头
Once we get beyond that, we gotta attack that hill.

244
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:24,560
上校说不能采取包抄攻势 我们得正面突袭
Colonel says there's no way to outflank it, so we gotta take it head-on by frontal assault.

245
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,770
- 伟特 - 是
- Whyte? - Yeah?

246
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,860
- 看到山坡前面吗? - 看到了
- See the grassy ridges at the foot of that hill? - Yeah.

247
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:35,950
等你攻上山坡 找到敌军据点然后消灭他们
When you get to the end of that field, eliminate all strong points on those ridges.

248
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:44,250
那儿一定有敌军守住
I'm sure the Japs got something there to protect the approaches.

249
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,440
主啊 您在吗?
Are you here?

250
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,830
别让我背叛您
Let me not betray you.

251
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,630
别让我背叛我的兄弟
Let me not betray my men.

252
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,600
您让我充满信心 和希望
In you I place my trust.

253
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,700
(希腊语)

254
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,700
玫瑰般的黎明
Rosy-fingered dawn.

255
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,620
你是希腊人
You're Greek, aren't you, Captain?

256
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,790
读过荷马的史诗吗?
D'you ever read Homer?

257
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:40,380
我在西点军校读过希腊原文
We read Homer at the Point.In Greek.

258
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,960
有多少炮兵支援火力?
What kind of artillery support do we have, sir? Over.

259
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:48,630
- 两组105榴弹炮 - 一点都没有用
- Two batteries of 105s. - They won't make a dent. Over.

260
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,100
不过能提高士气 日军会被炸得很难看
No, but it bucks the men up. It'll look like the Japs are catching hell.

261
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,820
兄弟们
OK, you guys.

262
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,570
准备上吧
This is it.

263
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,160
每组十人攻上山头
We're going down in groups often.

264
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:59,040
快速前进才不会成为目标
There's no point in going by rushes. Only make a better target stopped, so...

265
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,460
一路跑上去
run all the way.

266
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:04,880
我们被选上 别无选择 非去不可
We ain't got no choice. We're picked, so we gotta go.

267
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:10,300
我亲自带领先锋队
I'm gonna take the first bunch myself.

268
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,720
我要戴尔跟着我 戴尔?
I want Charlie Dale with me. Dale?

269
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,510
叫兄弟在山坡集合
You go organise them guys that's up there.

270
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:23,520
五分钟后出发
Moving out in five minutes.

271
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,020
走吧
Let's go.

272
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,110
施高?
Sico?

273
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,870
- 你怎么了? - 我的肚子好痛
- What's wrong with you? - I'm sick to my stomach.

274
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:39,290
起来 小心我踢扁你
Sico, you get up now, or I'll kick you so hard you're gonna be sick.

275
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:41,160
我站不起来
I can't. I would if I could.

276
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,580
我生病了
I'm sick.

277
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:45,540
我病了
I'm sick.

278
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:47,710
你没有病 起来
You ain't sick. Get up!

279
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:55,430
- 施高 怎么了? - 不晓得
- What's the matter, Sico? - I don't know, Sergeant.

280
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:58,680
肚子好痛 好像是胃痉孪
It's my stomach. I'm in pain, I got cramps.

281
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,020
我病了 坐不起来
I can't even sit up straight. I'm sick.

282
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,900
- 给我起来! - 别逼他了
- Come on, get up! - Leave him.

283
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:11,240
谁要替我拿步枪? 我带你找医官
I need a volunteer to carry the BAR! Drop your gear. I'm taking you to the medics.

284
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,400
谢谢你 副连长
Thank you, Sergeant.

285
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,780
别跟我争
Don't argue with me.

286
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:19,950
祝好运 杰克
Good luck, Keck.

287
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,930
也许他们撤退了
Maybe they pulled out.

288
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,310
快趴下!
Hit dirt!

289
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,640
趴下来!
Hit dirt!

290
00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:11,480
冷静点...冷静点...
Calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down.

291
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,320
担架兵
Stretcher-bearers!

292
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:35,670
这儿
Come on!

293
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,840
担架兵 在这儿
Stretcher-bearers, this way!

294
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:42,140
- 去救那兄弟 - 已经有八 九名伤兵...
- Go get that man. - We already got eight or nine down there...

295
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:46,270
- 别跟我争 我要救他 - 管不了他们了
- Don't argue with me! Get that man! - He's not the one we should think about...

296
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:49,650
该死 全都要救 我是指挥官
Goddamn it, all of you! Am I in command here or am I not?!

297
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:53,820
- 难道你是连长吗? - 我只是说别人伤得更重
- Am I the captain or a goddamn private? - Others are hit bad. That's all I meant.

298
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:57,910
- 二兵 听我的命令 - 是 长官!
- I gave you an order, private! - Yes, sir!

299
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,330
你好 副连长
Hello, First Sergeant.

300
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,500
我们要救谁?
Who we going after over here?

301
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:09,380
应该是积克
We think it's Jacques.

302
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,590
积克老兄
Ol' Jockey.

303
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:14,380
真是倒霉
Well, shit. That's, that's, that's too bad.

304
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,340
长官?
Sir?

305
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:22,300
把积克抬回去我能回来吗?
Sir? Sir, can I come back to the company after we get Jockey back to the battalion?

306
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:27,230
- 好 你要得到许可 - 当然 我的步枪
- OK, but you gotta get permission. - Sure. And my rifle.

307
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:32,690
力奇 你还活着
Nicky! You're still alive!

308
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:35,480
继续前进! 继续前进!
Keep moving! Keep moving!

309
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:42,580
太好了 史塔奥 好久没见到这么猛烈的攻击
Magnificent, Staros, magnificent. The finest thing these old eyes have seen in a long time!

310
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:47,160
你指挥得很好 我会请营长给你功勋
Beautifully conceived and executed! You'll be mentioned in battalion orders.

311
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,790
伟特排长的表现也很棒
Young Whyte led beautifully.

312
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:51,960
是 长官
Yes, sir. Over.

313
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,920
派第二排增援也很聪明
But sending in your second too was brilliant.

314
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,510
就快攻上去了 伤亡不惨重 布兰也不错
They may have carried the ridge. I don't think they were hurt too bad. Blane led well, too.

315
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:03,390
他们发现多少据点?
Now, how many emplacements did they locate?

316
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:05,560
消灭了多少?
Did they knock any out?

317
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:09,690
中午就应该能攻上山头
We ought to have those ridges cleaned out by noon! Over.

318
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:14,110
史塔奥 你在吗?
Hello! Hello! Staros, are you there?

319
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:16,440
我在 长官
Here, sir. Over.

320
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:21,410
他们发现多少据点? 消灭了多少?
I said, how many emplacements did they locate? Did they knock any out? Over.

321
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:23,870
孩子们
Children.

322
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:26,790
我不知道
I don't know, sir.

323
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:31,370
什么意思? 你怎么会不知道?
What the hell do you mean, you don't know? How can you not know? Over.

324
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:35,790
我在第一座山丘后面
I'm right here behind the first swell, sir. I'm right here behind the swell.

325
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,210
要我站起来招手吗?
You want me to stand up and wave? Over.

326
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:41,510
我看到了 你得想办法
No, I can see where you are. I want you to do something.

327
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:44,800
快上去看看情况如何
I want you to get up there and see what the situation is.

328
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:47,140
今晚我就要你攻下山头
I want Hill 210 in my hands tonight.

329
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:50,560
上将一早就要来查看
Now, goddamn it, the Admiral got up at dawn for this!

330
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,100
提起精神来 史塔奥
Come to life up there, Staros. Out!

331
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,550
上来
Move up!

332
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,360
嘿 杰克!
Hey, Keck!

333
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:44,450
干嘛?
Yeah?

334
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:47,700
- 我们得撤退 - 我知道
- We gotta get out of here. - I know it.

335
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,580
布兰死了
Blane's dead.

336
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:52,750
你得指挥
You're in charge.

337
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:58,840
美国佬 我们看到你们
We know you there, Yank!

338
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:01,710
东条英机去死
Tojo eats shit!

339
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,050
罗斯福去死
No! Roosevelt eats shit!

340
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,710
我打到他了 我打到他了
I got him! I got him!

341
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:02,730
我杀死一个人
I killed a man.

342
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,900
嘿 昆恩!
Hey, Queen!

343
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:07,490
昆恩 你在吗?
Queen, you there?

344
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:11,620
杀人比强奸更严重
Worst thing you can do. Worse than rape.

345
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,660
看到日本鬼子离开左边吗?
Queen! You see them Japs leaving that left ridge?

346
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:18,580
- 没有人能把我怎样 - 我什么也没看到
- I killed a man. Nobody can touch me for it. - I ain't seen nothing.

347
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:21,710
抬起头来看看
Well, get your fuckin' head up and look around!

348
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:25,260
我是说真的!
I'm serious!

349
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:29,260
有七个日兵离开左边
I counted seven Japs leaving that left-hand grassy ridge!

350
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,850
我打中一个
I got me one of 'em.

351
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:33,180
又怎样?
So?

352
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:35,520
他们可能会撤退
I think maybe they're pulling out.

353
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:41,230
也许该去告诉连长
Maybe somebody ought to go tell the captain.

354
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:42,860
你想去吗?
You wanna be the one to do it?

355
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:51,320
我命令你别乱动
You just stay put! I'm ordering you!

356
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:15,890
趴低
Down!

357
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:26,650
趴低点
Stay low.

358
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:55,300
冲! 冲!
Go! Go!

359
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:57,600
冲! 冲!
Go! Go!

360
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:40,520
现在怎么办?
What do we do now?

361
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:44,770
在这儿等 也许会有人来支援
We wait right here. Maybe they'll send us up some reinforcements.

362
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:46,310
做什么?
To do what?

363
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,440
攻下敌军的据点呀
To capture some of these fucking positions around here!

364
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:54,990
- 你要继续进攻? - 不知道 不能直接进攻山头
- You mean you really wanna go on with this? - Hell, no. No, not no uphill charge.

365
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:58,740
不过如果有支援
If they send us reinforcements, maybe we could scout around

366
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:00,910
就能试着除掉机关枪
and locate these machine guns.

367
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:05,000
- 总比冒死退回去好 - 有人来了
- Anyway, it's better than going back down. - Something's coming!

368
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,000
他们来了!
They're coming!

369
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:13,760
他们在干什么?
What are they doin'?

370
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,930
他们为什么不全力进攻?
If they want to throw us out, why didn't they come in force?

371
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:19,220
也许他们落了单
Maybe they was acting on their own.

372
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,230
也许他们想上西天
Maybe they wanted to get into nirvana.

373
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:26,600
敌人来了
They're coming.

374
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:37,820
怎么回事?
Keck!

375
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:39,320
天啊
Jesus!

376
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:41,490
老天!
Oh, Jesus!

377
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,750
我炸到屁股!
I blew my butt off!

378
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:48,250
- 没事 没事 - 我把屁股炸掉了
- It's all right. It's all right. - I blew my butt off!

379
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:49,790
趴下来
Lay down!

380
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,630
我怎么会这么衰?
What a fucking recruit trick to pull!

381
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:55,720
- 我只拔到保险制 - 写信给我老婆
- Take it easy. Take it easy. - I grabbed it by the pin!

382
00:56:56,430 --> 00:57:00,850
告诉她我死得很光荣
You write my old lady. You tell her... I want her to know I died like a man.

383
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:03,270
你不会死的 没人给她写 得你自己来
Nobody's gonna have to write her. You'll make it.

384
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:05,230
- 别骗我 - 下来
- Don't bullshit me! - Stay down!

385
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:07,390
嘿 嘿
Hey, hey.

386
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,270
我全身是泥
Have I got mud on my face?

387
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,440
帮我擦掉
Wipe it off. Get it off.

388
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:16,030
不
No!

389
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:18,200
我会写信给她
I'll write her. I promise.

390
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:25,420
我的水壶还有水 拿去吧
Take my canteen. There's still some water in there.

391
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:32,300
也许这样最好
It's for the best.

392
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:35,470
我的下面被炸烂
I'm all messed up down there.

393
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,730
不能搞了
I can't fuck no more.

394
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:44,480
我在哪儿?
Whoa... Where am I?

395
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:47,610
我在哪儿?
Where am I?

396
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:52,740
你不会有事
You're gonna be all right.

397
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:56,950
就算你死了 你没有对不起兄弟
Even if you die, you didn't let your brother down.

398
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:01,750
要是你不扑上去 我们全都会死
If you hadn't thrown yourself against that embankment, we'd all have been killed.

399
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:03,920
我好冷
I'm cold.

400
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:08,510
我好冷
I'm cold.

401
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,840
我快冻死了
I'm... freezing.

402
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:09,020
你要写信给他老婆?
You gonna write his wife?

403
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:12,310
才不要
Fuck, no.

404
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:14,810
我又不认识她
I don't know his old lady.

405
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,940
那是连长的事 别傻了 我不会写信
That's the company commander's job. You outta your mind? I ain't no good at writing.

406
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:22,110
你答应过他
You told him you would.

407
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:25,990
他快死了 我得那么说
I'll say anything to 'em when they're like that.

408
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:28,700
有人得写信给她
Somebody ought to do it.

409
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:31,660
你写给她吧
Well, then, you write her. Yeah, you write her.

410
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,220
怎么回事?
What's wrong, Jim?

411
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:08,300
他没救了 谁也救不了他
There's nothing anybody can do for him. He'll die before they get him to a surgeon.

412
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:13,390
- 你不必去了 - 我可以替他注射吗啡
- Then I can't ask you to go out there. - Maybe I could get some morphine into him.

413
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:16,730
- 能让他安静吗? - 不能 我可以打两针
- Would it keep him quiet? - Not for long, but I can give him two.

414
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:20,230
留三 四针给他自己打
And I could maybe leave him three or four for himself.

415
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,610
你能一次打完吗?
Couldn't you give 'em to him all at once?

416
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:45,170
你们都会死
That's what you are.

417
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,010
我们全都会没命
That's all there is for us. That's us, that's us.

418
01:01:50,590 --> 01:01:53,850
我的十二名弟兄都死了
I lost all twelve. I lost all twelve.

419
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,020
全都挂了
All twelve of 'em.

420
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:58,560
太疯狂了
It's insanity up there.

421
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:02,730
我叫他们勇往直前
I told 'em what to do, I showed 'em where to go and I gave 'em a push.

422
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:08,150
- 救命 - 我认得你...副连长
- Somebody help! - I know you. I know you, Sergeant.

423
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:12,950
这里谁指挥? 别放走他
It's insane. I don't know who's in charge here, but don't let him go! Don't let him go!

424
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:15,080
我要走 我要走
I'm outta here. I'm outta here.

425
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:19,290
两只脚 快走 走啊
I'm outta here. All right, move feet. Move, move, move, move. Move, move!

426
01:02:19,370 --> 01:02:22,130
我要走了 我要走了...
I'm moving. I'm moving. I'm moving now.

427
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:26,880
别碰我 别看我 别碰我 别看我 我走了
Don't touch. Don't touch. Don't look at me. Don't touch. OK, I'm outta here.

428
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,970
没事了 没事了
All right. All right.

429
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:32,010
没事了 没事了
All right. All right.

430
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:52,160
救救我
Somebody help me!

431
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,490
救救我!
Help me!

432
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:58,370
还好吧 小子? 我来救你了 提拉
You gotta be quiet. I came to help you, Tella.

433
01:02:58,450 --> 01:03:00,870
- 安静点 - 去你的
- OK. Calm down. - Fuck you!

434
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,040
我快死了 我快死了
I'm dying! I'm dying, sarge!

435
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:06,550
那就安静地等死
OK. Well, goddamn it, do it with less noise!

436
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:10,380
- 你能救我吗? - 我会带你回去
- How you gonna get me out? - I'm gonna take you back.

437
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,470
- 来 - 不!
- Come on. - No!

438
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:18,140
放我下来 放我下来
Put me down! Put me down!

439
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,480
别管我 你别管我
Leave me alone... Leave me alone.

440
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:28,940
你别管我
Please, leave me alone.

441
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:39,450
给我多一点 给我多一点
Give me more. Give me more.

442
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:42,330
再给我多一点...
Give me more. Give me more.

443
01:03:42,410 --> 01:03:44,580
再给我多一点...
Give me more. Give me more.

444
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:48,960
来吧
Here, Tella.

445
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:00,350
再见...再见...
Goodbye... goodbye.

446
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,310
再见了 小子
Bye, kid.

447
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,400
再见 副连长
Goodbye, sarge. Goodbye.

448
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:28,630
幸好部队不必只靠一个大兵
Fortunately, Jim, the fate of the company doesn't depend on one man.

449
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:36,590
我用望远镜看到经过
Sergeant, I saw the whole thing through the glasses.

450
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:40,930
我会请营长表扬你
I'm gonna mention you in orders tomorrow and recommend you for the Silver Star.

451
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:43,640
- 我要替你争取银星勋章 - 长官
- It's the most courageous thing... - Captain,

452
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:47,940
你再说下去我就把你揍扁
you say one more word to thank me, I'll knock you right in the teeth.

453
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:51,730
你去争取勋章 我马上辞职
You mention me in your fuckin' orders, and I'll resign so fast

454
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:55,860
让你一个人指挥这个烂部队
and leave you here to run this busted-up outfit by yourself.

455
01:04:57,110 --> 01:04:59,200
懂不懂?
You understand?

456
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:03,660
权力! 打仗全是为了权力
Property! Whole fuckin' thing's about property.

457
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:22,890
你在搞什么鬼? 马上派人支援他们
What's the matter with you, Staros? Those men should be reinforced immediately!

458
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:25,810
他们在干嘛?
What are they doing? I can see 'em through my glasses.

459
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:27,980
躲在那里做什么?
They're lying behind that ledge!

460
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:31,610
他们应该去消灭机关枪
They should be up and out, cleaning out those machine guns! Over!

461
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:34,610
我想你不明白 长官
I don't think you understand what's going on, sir.

462
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:37,570
我们的伤亡惨重
We've had... heavy casualties.

463
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:42,530
有一个人的肠子被打出来 死得很惨
We had a man... His gut got shot out on the slopes, sir. Created quite an upset.

464
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:45,790
好吧 到底有没有支援?
Fine, fine. Now, what about those reinforcements? Over.

465
01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:51,710
第一排有两个班可以支援
I have two squads to First Platoon I can send up, sir. Over.

466
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:54,210
什么 两个班?!
What the hell do you mean, two squads?!

467
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:57,760
该死 我叫你支援就照办
Goddamn you, Staros! When I say reinforcements,

468
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:02,600
马上派全体兄弟攻上去
goddamn it, I mean it! You commit everybody you have there and do it now!

469
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:06,680
第一排也得去 我看到他们躺着不动
Your First Platoon, too. I see 'em lying on their fat asses doing nothing.

470
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:11,810
派人上去 命令他们进攻 命令他们侧攻
Get a man to 'em right now with orders to attack, and move 'em by the flank to the ridge.

471
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:14,690
然后叫第二排攻上山头
Then get that Second Platoon over to the hill!

472
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:18,030
叫他们直接攻上去
Have 'em press the centre. Go straight up that goddamn hill!

473
01:06:18,110 --> 01:06:19,780
马上进攻
Attack them right now!

474
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:23,660
天啊 要我教吗?
Jesus, Staros! Do i have to give you a lesson on infantry tactics

475
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:26,370
你的兄弟快被射死了
while your men are getting their asses shot off?.

476
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:30,210
上校 你不明白这里的情况
Colonel, I don't think you fully understand what is going on here.

477
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:33,500
光凭这一队不能攻下山头
My company alone cannot take that position, sir.

478
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:37,090
敌军防守严密 火力太强
The Japs are too well dug in. They've got too much fire power.

479
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:39,260
上面有座碉堡
Colonel, there's a bunker up there.

480
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:42,720
我们看不到 它把我的兄弟打得很惨
We can't see it, and it's... it's chewing my men to pieces, sir.

481
01:06:45,890 --> 01:06:49,480
请你准许我先派人
I request permission for patrol reconnaissance around

482
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:53,190
进入右边的森林搜查
to the right of Hill 210. I believe the entire position, sir,

483
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:55,900
从右边包抄应该能攻下山头
can be outflanked with a manoeuvre there in force.

484
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:58,280
- 不行 该死 - 挽救生命
- No! Goddamn it, no! - Might save lives!

485
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,240
不能包抄
There'll be no flanking move.

486
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:03,160
听我说 你不能带兄弟
Listen, Staros. You're not gonna take your men

487
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:06,700
躲到丛林当缩头乌龟
around into the jungle to avoid a goddamn fight!

488
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:12,330
我要你带领兄弟全力进攻
Do you hear me, Staros? I want you to attack right now with every man at your disposal!

489
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:15,290
史塔奥 快进攻 这是命令
Now, attack, Staros! That's a direct order!

490
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:27,640
我必须违背你的命令
Sir, I must tell you that I refuse to obey your order.

491
01:07:42,110 --> 01:07:46,070
- 在那里 能看见吗? - 看不见
- There it is, right there. See it? - I don't see it.

492
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:49,620
你没有错 他下了命令
This is not your fault, Jim. He's ordering you to.

493
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:58,630
我请你让我派人到丛林搜查
I again request permission for patrol reconnaissance around to the right in force.

494
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:03,590
现在时间是...13时21分25秒
The time, sir,... is 1321 hours, 25 seconds.

495
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:08,680
两名证人听到我的话 请你也找证人
I have two witnesses here. I request that you do the same with witnesses there. Over.

496
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:17,400
别给我来律师那一套
Staros, don't pull this guardhouse-lawyer bullshit with me!

497
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:21,610
你是律师 这里却不是法庭
Now, I know you're a goddamn lawyer! This is not a court of law.

498
01:08:21,690 --> 01:08:23,950
这是战场 我们在打仗
This is a war. It's a goddamn battle!

499
01:08:24,030 --> 01:08:28,910
我重覆 我要你正面攻击
Now, I want that frontal attack. I repeat my order. Over.

500
01:08:28,990 --> 01:08:32,660
我拒绝率领兄弟作正面攻击
Colonel, I refuse to take my men up there in a frontal attack.

501
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:34,920
这等于是自杀
It's suicide, sir.

502
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,170
我和他们生活两年半 不能命令他们送死 完毕
I've lived with these men for two years, and I will not order them all to their deaths. Over.

503
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:51,770
这是很重大的决定
This is a very important decision, Staros.

504
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:59,190
也许你有理由这么做
But if you feel that strongly, maybe you have a reason, so I'm coming down.

505
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:01,650
我要过去
Go take a look.

506
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:04,440
我不是取消命令
I'm not rescinding my order to you, son,

507
01:09:04,530 --> 01:09:09,370
不过如果是特殊状况 我会仔细考虑
but if I find extenuating circumstances when I get there, I'll take that into account.

508
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:13,750
你们守在那儿等我来
Now, in the meantime, goddamn it, I want you to hold on until I get there.

509
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:18,040
可能的话叫那些兄弟前进 完毕
And, if possible, you get those men on the ridge out and moving! Out.

510
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,660
(希腊语)

511
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:33,890
哪里都一样
One spot's as good as another, men.

512
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:36,060
根本就无处可躲
There's no place to hide.

513
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:45,070
孩子 放松点
Just take it easy, son. Take it easy. Take it easy.

514
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:48,530
费夫呢?
Where's... where's Fife?

515
01:09:48,610 --> 01:09:50,820
在这儿 费夫
Fife? He's right here, son. Fife.

516
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:53,540
握住我的手
Hold my hand, Fife.

517
01:09:54,450 --> 01:09:56,540
握我的手
Hold my hand.

518
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:03,710
抓住了
I got it.

519
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:09,800
我快死了
I'm dying, Fife.

520
01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:39,000
连长...
Oh, Captain...

521
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:30,380
我被埋在棺材里
Shut up in a tomb.

522
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:34,640
掀不起棺盖
Can't lift the lid.

523
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:39,180
我的处境进退两难
Played a role I never conceived.

524
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:43,480
穿上衣服 这不是海滩
Get that blouse on, soldier. It's not a goddamn bathing beach!

525
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,230
立刻穿上
Put it on right now.

526
01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:48,690
你在指谁? 去杀敌呀
What you aiming at, son? Let's go get those son of a bitches.

527
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:50,860
前进!
Move up!

528
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:04,370
你趴在这儿什么也看不到
What are you doing laying down there where you can't see a damn thing?

529
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:13,260
我正在观察 我派第一排上去
Observing, sir. Just sent First Platoon forward to the ridge.

530
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:16,970
- 这次有几个中弹? - 没有
- How many of 'em were hit this time? - None, sir.

531
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:19,140
一个都没有?
None? Not one?

532
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:24,100
这跟你说的情况不一样
Doesn't sound like the situation you described to me over the sound power.

533
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:28,770
五分钟前情况改变了
Well, it's not. The situation's changed just in the last five minutes, sir.

534
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,400
上尉 给我听住
Captain, you listen to me.

535
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:37,120
我们要全力向前进攻
We're going over there and taking everybody with us.

536
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,700
有问题吗?
Do you have any more complaints or demurrers?

537
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:44,460
- 现在 没有 - 好吧 你得照我的方法
- No, sir. Not now. - All right! We're gonna do things my way!

538
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:46,960
让我来指挥
My way! You understand that, Captain?

539
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:51,340
大家上去 晚上得攻下来
We're taking everybody over to that ledge! We may take that ridge by nightfall!

540
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:55,300
上面的火力还是很强
I think the ridge is quite a way from being reduced, sir.

541
01:13:02,470 --> 01:13:04,980
神啊 你到底看到什么?
Show me how to see things the way you do.

542
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:10,520
让我知道你看到什么
Show me how to see things the way you do.

543
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:16,990
我们全是尘土
We're just dirt. We're just dirt.

544
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:43,100
留在这儿肯定送命
We're gonna get killed if we stay here.

545
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:46,430
比尔 带六个弟兄
Bell, take six men

546
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:48,600
上去探查
and go see what's up there.

547
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:57,030
我们会掩护你们
And we'll cover you the best we can from down there.

548
01:15:16,770 --> 01:15:18,230
好
OK.

549
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,820
你们留下来
You guys, you guys, stay here. OK?

550
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:24,030
我一个人去
I'm going alone.

551
01:17:03,630 --> 01:17:05,720
来吧
Come out.

552
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:13,140
到我的身边
Come out where lam.

553
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:24,380
上面有...上面有...
There was a... There was a...

554
01:18:25,670 --> 01:18:28,380
上面有一座碉堡
There's a bunker... up there.

555
01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:32,300
总共有五支机关枪
It's five guns.

556
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,930
五支机关枪
It's five guns.

557
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:44,230
攻下那些乱石间的碉堡
That strongpoint up there, somewhere up there around those rocks,

558
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,400
就能攻下这座山头
is the key to this ridge.

559
01:18:49,490 --> 01:18:51,610
比尔说得没错
Bell here is quite right.

560
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:57,410
日本鬼子从上面
From their knob up there, those little brown brothers can cover the whole of the ground

561
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:01,830
可以扫射一千码内的目标 不过他们漏掉这地方
in front of this position for 1,000 yards. They've left this ledge unguarded.

562
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:05,880
这是很严重的错误 这是很严重的错误
Now, goddamn it, that's a mistake. That's a hell of a mistake.

563
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:10,130
我们得利用他们的疏忽
We need to take advantage of it before they see their error.

564
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:16,010
我知道你们筋疲力尽
All right, all right, I know you're all pretty exhausted,

565
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:19,560
这里连清水也没有
and we've had a hell of a time getting water up here.

566
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:23,350
对不起 我向大家道歉
For that I'm sorry. I apologise to you all.

567
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:29,150
不过明天若能攻下这座碉堡 就能占领山头
But if we can reduce this bunker tomorrow, I think we can take this ridge.

568
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:34,320
有没有人自愿
So I'm asking for volunteers.

569
01:19:34,410 --> 01:19:36,660
回去攻下那座碉堡
Go back up there and knock it out.

570
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:38,830
长官
Sir?

571
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:41,000
我愿意...
I'll be glad to go back up

572
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:43,420
- 身先士卒回去作战 - 很好 比尔
- and lead the way back for a party. - Right.

573
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:45,210
- 上校 我也去 - 还有你
- I'll go, sir. - You.

574
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:47,420
好的
All right.

575
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:52,340
- 我很想率领突击队 - 我正希望你去 约翰
- I'd like to lead the party, Colonel. - All right, John. I was hoping you'd say that.

576
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:55,340
- 你来指挥 - 我要去
- You'll be in command. - I'll go, sir.

577
01:19:55,430 --> 01:19:56,800
- 长官 - 你
- Sir? - You.

578
01:19:56,890 --> 01:20:00,890
够了 七个人够多了 准备出发
All right, men, that's enough. Seven is plenty. Gather up.

579
01:20:04,690 --> 01:20:09,190
史塔奥 你知道这一役有多重要吗?
I don't know if you realise the importance of this operation, Staros.

580
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:13,780
攻下这座岛 轰炸机就能降落
Once our position is secured, we can move the bombers in.

581
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:17,830
我们的军队 便有一千英里的空中攻击力
That means air power for 1,000 miles in every direction.

582
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:22,370
窝达康拉尔岛一役能决定胜负
Guadalcanal may be the turning point in the war.

583
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:27,080
- 你不同意 一定得牺牲性命? - 不是 长官
- It'll cost lives. Is that what's troubling you? - No, sir.

584
01:20:30,210 --> 01:20:33,220
我跟你说过胜利的重要
I explained to you the importance of this objective.

585
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:36,510
你认为牺牲多少兄弟才值得?
How many men do you think it's worth? How many lives?

586
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:38,680
我不知道
I can't say, sir.

587
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:49,820
你愿意牺牲你的兄弟吗?
Are you prepared to sacrifice the lives of any of your men in this campaign?

588
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:54,400
多少? 一个? 两个?
How many? One? Two?

589
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,050
二十个?
Twenty?

590
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:01,590
你的小队一定会死人
Lives will be lost in your company, Captain.

591
01:21:02,930 --> 01:21:07,350
要是你受不了 现在最好让我知道
And if you don't have the stomach for it, now is the time to let me know.

592
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:12,140
不 你说得对 你说得都对
No, sir. You're right... about everything you said.

593
01:21:12,230 --> 01:21:14,310
好吧 没事了
Fine, fine.

594
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,480
好吧 长官
That's all, Captain.

595
01:21:18,190 --> 01:21:20,280
还有一件事
One more thing, Staros.

596
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:25,320
你不必跟我说我说得对
It's not necessary for you to ever tell me that you think I'm right.

597
01:21:25,910 --> 01:21:27,580
没有必要
Ever.

598
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:30,000
这是理所当然的
We'll assume it.

599
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:31,960
解散
Dismissed.

600
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,850
我为你感到遗憾
I feel sorry for you, kid.

601
01:21:52,230 --> 01:21:54,310
- 是吗? - 有一点吧
- Yeah? - Yeah, a little.

602
01:21:57,770 --> 01:21:59,860
这场仗会害死你
This army's gonna kill you.

603
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:09,330
你还是保佑自己好运点 别想救别人了
If you were smart, you'd take care of yourself. There's nothing you can do for anybody else.

604
01:22:09,410 --> 01:22:13,580
就算你拼命也救不了什么人
You're just running into a burning house where nobody can be saved.

605
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:31,270
在乱世中一个人的力量很渺小
What difference do you think you can make? One single man in all this madness.

606
01:22:36,810 --> 01:22:39,230
不要白白送死
If you die, it's gonna be for nothing.

607
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:48,030
没有另一个美好世界
There's not some other world out there where everything's gonna be OK.

608
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:50,200
这是唯一的世界
There's just this one.

609
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:54,200
只有这座孤岛
Just this rock.

610
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:33,660
来吧 让我死吧
Go ahead! Come on, come on.

611
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:36,870
谁能决定别人的生?
Who's deciding who's gonna live?

612
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:39,670
谁能决定别人的死?
Who's deciding who's gonna die?

613
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:43,630
太荒谬了
This is futile!

614
01:23:45,090 --> 01:23:50,180
看看我 我身上没有中弹
Look at me! I stand right up here and not one bullet.

615
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:52,350
毫发未伤!
Not one shot!

616
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:55,140
为什么?
Why?

617
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:57,520
他们全都死了
How come they all had to die?

618
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:02,060
我却站在这儿 一点事也没有
I can stand right here, I can stand right up and nothing happens to me!

619
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:24,670
我们
We.

620
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:33,300
我们在一起
We together.

621
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:46,110
合而为一
One being.

622
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:03,420
水乳交融
Flow together like water,

623
01:25:06,710 --> 01:25:09,010
分不出你和我
till I can't tell you from me.

624
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:28,980
我爱你
I drink you.

625
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:33,110
现在
Now.

626
01:25:35,450 --> 01:25:37,530
现在
Now.

627
01:26:14,150 --> 01:26:16,240
您是我的明灯
You're my light.

628
01:26:19,490 --> 01:26:21,580
我的指引
My guide.

629
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:34,110
我们在后面 要是攻破防线
John, I'll be behind you. If you wanna break through, we'll come after.

630
01:27:34,190 --> 01:27:36,740
就吹哨子通知我们冲上去
We'll charge at your whistle signal.

631
01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:39,990
去吧 去杀敌吧
All right, let's go, men. Go get 'em.

632
01:29:34,310 --> 01:29:36,400
好
OK.

633
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:40,070
你们留在底下
Stay down, below this ledge,

634
01:29:40,150 --> 01:29:44,160
我从上面叫出敌人方位
and I'll call down the data from above.

635
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:48,830
让炮兵密集轰炸这些岩石
Once the 81s have plastered that rock... as much as possible,

636
01:29:48,910 --> 01:29:52,710
再到大石旁找掩护
we're gonna crawl out along that big rock for cover

637
01:29:54,210 --> 01:29:56,290
然后从右翼进攻
and then flank 'em to the right.

638
01:29:56,380 --> 01:29:58,250
好吗?
OK?

639
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:02,340
好...好
OK. OK.

640
01:30:23,030 --> 01:30:27,620

上吧
Let's go!

653
01:31:52,870 --> 01:31:56,290
从右翼攻上山头
OK, we're gonna continue on up the hill to the right.

654
01:31:56,370 --> 01:32:00,630
等我信号再开枪或丢手榴弹
Nobody fire or throw the grenades till I give the signal.

655
01:32:00,710 --> 01:32:02,790
好 咱们上
OK, let's do it.

656
01:32:17,430 --> 01:32:20,400
他没事吧?
Is he OK? ls he all right?

657
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:22,860
不能把他带走 怎么办?
What we gonna do? Can't take him with us.

658
01:32:22,940 --> 01:32:26,990
- 不能把他留下来 - 你们是同队兄弟 你陪他
- No, we can't leave him here. - He's from your platoon. You stay with him.

659
01:32:27,070 --> 01:32:31,070
我们回来再接他...如果他还活着
We can leave him and pick him up on the way back,... if he's still alive.

660
01:32:34,950 --> 01:32:37,370
- 他死了吗? - 还没有
- Is he dead? - Not yet.

661
01:32:37,450 --> 01:32:41,040
陪着他 掩护我们 冲吧
Dale, stay with him! Cover our flank! Move!

662
01:33:05,770 --> 01:33:06,860
小心后面
Behind you!

663
01:33:22,290 --> 01:33:24,380
我们被打得好惨
We're pinned down!

664
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:56,410
撤退
Fall back!

665
01:34:01,370 --> 01:34:02,830
走吧
Go!

666
01:35:13,940 --> 01:35:16,030
小心
Watch out.

667
01:35:54,650 --> 01:35:56,110
安全了!
Clear!

668
01:36:48,330 --> 01:36:50,420
给我滚出来
Come on. Get out.

669
01:36:51,790 --> 01:36:53,880
出来
Go on.

670
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:58,970
你想杀我们?
Think you're soldiers?

671
01:37:05,970 --> 01:37:08,220
你这人渣
You piece of shit!

672
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:16,360
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch!

673
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:18,530
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch!

674
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:39,630
如何?
All right?

675
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:44,470
我杀死一个人
I shot a man.

676
01:38:19,710 --> 01:38:21,800
这里好臭
Stinks around here.

677
01:38:23,010 --> 01:38:26,550
- 这么多死人 - 鼻孔里塞烟头
- All these dead people. - Put a cigarette up your nose.

678
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:51,140
看他们逃命!
Look at 'em move!

679
01:39:51,220 --> 01:39:52,970
看他们逃命!
Look at 'em move!

680
01:39:53,060 --> 01:39:54,930
把他们赶跑了
We got 'em on the run!

681
01:39:55,020 --> 01:39:58,230
约翰 干得好 你把他们打得落花流水
Way to go, John. When they saw you make that attack and win,

682
01:39:58,310 --> 01:40:00,860
兄弟们都士气高涨
you put their hearts back into them.

683
01:40:00,940 --> 01:40:03,150
- 嘿 嘿 - 别打了
- Hey, hey! - Don't do that, soldier.

684
01:40:03,230 --> 01:40:08,070
把犯人带来 交给情报部 他们马上就来
Take care of the others. G-2 will want them. There'll be somebody around before long.

685
01:40:08,150 --> 01:40:10,620
浪费了很多时间 走吧
We've wasted enough time here. Let's go.

686
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:13,450
我要推荐一些人接受勋章
Sir, I've a few recommendations for decorations.

687
01:40:13,530 --> 01:40:17,080
我会尽力向他们争取 但是迟些再说
Yes. We'll get everything for all of 'em that we can, but later.

688
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:21,630
不过我要你知道 我会推荐你接受勋章
Meantime, I want you to know I'm personally recommending you for something, John.

689
01:40:21,710 --> 01:40:23,170
也许是英勇奖章
Perhaps the big one.

690
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:26,340
-  谢谢你 不过我... - 这是你应得的
- Thank you, sir, but I don't feel... - Yes, you do, John.

691
01:40:26,420 --> 01:40:29,260
能不能争取到才是问题
Getting it for you will be the goddamn problem!

692
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:33,760
你能受勋对部队有很大鼓舞
But, hell, it'd be a big thing for the battalion and the regiment, if you did get it.

693
01:40:33,850 --> 01:40:35,510
最好赶快前进
We better move out.

694
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:40,140
加入别的部队攻上山头
We need to extend our lines, hook up with the other companies and push on to the top.

695
01:40:40,230 --> 01:40:43,190
你想指挥B队吗?
Would you like to take command of Baker Company?

696
01:40:43,270 --> 01:40:44,320
当然想
Of course.

697
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:49,030
我不想扫你的兴 但是没有食水...
Sir, I don't mean to be a wet blanket, but about the water. If we don't get water...

698
01:40:49,110 --> 01:40:51,200
别担心水的问题
Don't worry about water.

699
01:40:52,700 --> 01:40:57,950
现在士气如虹 不能中断
John, I don't want anything to break up this attack of ours now we have the momentum.

700
01:40:58,040 --> 01:41:01,580
过几个小时就有食用水
We'll have some water in a... couple of hours.

701
01:41:01,670 --> 01:41:03,750
我会安排的
I've arranged for that.

702
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:07,880
该死 现在不能停下来
Now, we just can't stop now, goddamn it, and wait for it.

703
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:09,840
是的 长官
No, sir.

704
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:12,130
没错
That's right.

705
01:41:12,220 --> 01:41:18,020
如果有些人因脱水昏倒 那就让他们昏倒
And if some of the men... pass out, why, hell, they'll just have to pass out.

706
01:41:21,810 --> 01:41:23,690
好吧
All right.

707
01:41:23,770 --> 01:41:25,230
他们会死的
They could...

708
01:41:25,310 --> 01:41:28,650
他们也会被敌人杀死
They could die from it.They could die from enemy fire, too!

709
01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:32,280
他们很坚强
They're all tough boys.

710
01:41:37,030 --> 01:41:42,160
兄弟们 走吧 一路上会有更多死人
Come on, men, let's go! You'll see plenty more of those where we're going!

711
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:44,830
到底要不要上山头?
Are we going up this hill or aren't we?

712
01:41:48,710 --> 01:41:52,680
我相信现在能突破日军防线
John, I'm convinced that the Japanese position can be broken now.

713
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:57,850
只要继续前进 日落时就能攻下山头
All we have to do is keep going and we'll have this hill. We'll have this hill by sundown.

714
01:41:57,930 --> 01:42:00,930
看到他们全新的斗志吗?
You see the spirit in these men? D'you see the new spirit?

715
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:06,190
我们得一鼓作气 乘胜追击
Well, I want to take advantage of that before something happens to sap their strength.

716
01:42:06,270 --> 01:42:09,150
要是稍微迟疑就会战败
To have this battalion relieved in a defeat,

717
01:42:09,230 --> 01:42:12,690
或者是根本
or even to have it reinforced from troops

718
01:42:12,690 --> 01:42:16,160
攻不上山头
from the reserves,if we were to stall before reaching the top, well,

719
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:20,490
天啊 我不能忍受失败
Jesus Christ, that's just a hell of a lot more than I could stand!

720
01:42:20,580 --> 01:42:22,960
我等了一辈子
I've waited all my life for this.

721
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:27,590
一直以来忍气吞声 都是为了这一刻
I've worked, slaved, eaten... oh, untold buckets of shit to have this opportunity!

722
01:42:27,670 --> 01:42:30,130
我不会半途而废
And I don't intend to give it up now.

723
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:36,970
你不知道被忽略的感受
You don't know what it feels like to be passed over.

724
01:42:37,050 --> 01:42:40,220
你刚出军校 还很年轻
I mean, you're young. You're just out of the Academy.

725
01:42:40,310 --> 01:42:45,980
你生对时代了 我等了十五年才等到这场战争
You're, you know, you've got your war! This 15 years, this is my first war!

726
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:54,780
有一天你会了解
John, some day you'll understand.

727
01:43:00,660 --> 01:43:02,750
我把你当儿子看待
You're like a son to me, John.

728
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:07,210
知道我儿子做什么吗?
You know what my son does?

729
01:43:08,130 --> 01:43:10,210
他做鱼饵生意
He's a bait salesman.

730
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:14,880
你干得很好
You've done a hell of a job, John.

731
01:43:14,970 --> 01:43:19,850
我要让你得到应得的荣誉
I'm gonna make sure that you get everything, everything that you deserve.

732
01:43:22,100 --> 01:43:24,180
谢谢你 长官
Thank you, sir.

733
01:43:26,270 --> 01:43:28,350
天啊...
God...

734
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:31,900
该死 我要三名传令兵
Goddamn it! I want three runners!

735
01:43:31,980 --> 01:43:33,650
给我三名传令兵
Get me three runners!

736
01:43:33,730 --> 01:43:35,990
回去找水源
You go back to the rear to find water

737
01:43:36,070 --> 01:43:38,950
马上运过来
and get back here with it as fast as you can!

738
01:43:39,870 --> 01:43:43,080
一小时后就全力进攻
We attack in one hour! We'll throw everything we got at 'em.

739
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:45,660
不能失败 没人能阻止
We're going all the way! Nothing'll stop us.

740
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:47,830
晚上就得成功
It's high ground by nightfall!

741
01:44:11,980 --> 01:44:14,530
你看过死人吗?
You seen many dead people?

742
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:17,280
很多
Plenty.

743
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:19,990
跟死狗没两样
They're no different than dead dogs,

744
01:44:20,700 --> 01:44:22,780
只要有这种想法
once you get used to the idea.

745
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:29,710
他们就像猪肉一样
They're meat, kid.

746
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:48,730
你们代表正义和善良吗?
Are you righteous? Kind?

747
01:44:51,810 --> 01:44:53,980
你们是否有信心?
Does your confidence lie in this?

748
01:44:57,400 --> 01:44:59,490
受到大家爱护?
Are you loved by all?

749
01:45:01,780 --> 01:45:03,870
我跟你们一样
Know that I was, too.

750
01:45:07,450 --> 01:45:12,120
你们认为自己所受的苦难 是比较少吗?
Do you imagine your sufferings will be less because you loved goodness?

751
01:45:12,750 --> 01:45:14,840
我们善良有良知
Truth?

752
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:16,410
趴下来 趴下来
Get fucking on the ground! Get down! Get down!

753
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:19,250
趴下来 呆着
Get down. Stay there.

754
01:49:27,710 --> 01:49:31,590
给我趴下来 快点
Get on the ground! Get on the fucking ground!

755
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:33,550
快!
Now!

756
01:50:33,080 --> 01:50:35,160
这么可怕的邪恶
This great evil.

757
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:40,000
它来自哪里?
Where's it come from?

758
01:50:44,670 --> 01:50:46,760
怎么会潜伏在世上?
How'd it steal into the world?

759
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:02,070
原因和根源到底是什么?
What seed, what root did it grow from?

760
01:51:06,990 --> 01:51:09,070
这是谁造成的?
Who's doing this?

761
01:51:11,660 --> 01:51:13,740
谁在屠杀众生
Who's killing us?

762
01:51:17,710 --> 01:51:20,210
剥夺我们的生命之火
Robbing us of life and light.

763
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:28,380
嘲笑我们对人间的依恋
Mocking us with the sight of what we might have known.

764
01:51:54,370 --> 01:51:57,080
战争对地球有利吗?
Does our ruin benefit the Earth?

765
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:03,090
它能滋长万物 孕育众生吗?
Does it help the grass to grow or the sun to shine?

766
01:52:09,260 --> 01:52:11,550
上帝也有黑暗的一面?
Is this darkness in you, too?

767
01:52:18,020 --> 01:52:20,350
他是否也感受邪恶力量?
Have you passed through this night?

768
01:52:26,570 --> 01:52:29,110
我要把你开膛剖肚
I'm gonna sink my teeth into your liver.

769
01:52:32,820 --> 01:52:34,910
你死定了
You're dying.

770
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:48,960
看到那些鸟吗?
See them birds up there?

771
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:53,010
它们会把你生吞活剥
You know they eat you raw?

772
01:52:57,930 --> 01:53:01,100
你下地狱就回不来
Where you're going, you're not coming back from.

773
01:53:07,590 --> 01:53:10,560
(日语)

774
01:54:12,590 --> 01:54:14,680
你对我有意义吗?
What are you to me?

775
01:54:20,470 --> 01:54:22,560
毫无义意
Nothing.

776
01:56:43,780 --> 01:56:45,870
坐下来
Have a seat here.

777
01:56:56,130 --> 01:56:58,920
史塔奥 我要将你革职
Staros, I'm relieving you of your command.

778
01:57:02,300 --> 01:57:04,680
班中尉会取代你
Lieutenant Band will take over for you.

779
01:57:06,390 --> 01:57:08,470
我跟他说了
I already told him.

780
01:57:18,860 --> 01:57:21,150
我也不想这么做
It's a hard thing to do.

781
01:57:21,950 --> 01:57:24,030
这是很困难的决定
Difficult decision to make.

782
01:57:27,160 --> 01:57:29,330
你的心不够狠
I don't think you're tough enough.

783
01:57:30,830 --> 01:57:35,830
你心太软了 不够心狠手辣
You're too soft. You're just too soft-hearted. You're not tough-fibred enough.

784
01:57:40,380 --> 01:57:44,340
我的心意已定 没什么好说
Anyway, it's my decision to make. I've already made it.

785
01:57:45,050 --> 01:57:47,550
我不想让我的兄弟送死
I don't like to see my men get killed, sir.

786
01:57:55,810 --> 01:57:59,020
有人曾死在你怀里吗?
Have you ever had anyone die in your arms, sir?

787
01:57:59,110 --> 01:58:01,400
有吗?
Have you?

788
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:17,000
我不想引起事端
I don't see any reason to make a scandal out of this.

789
01:58:17,080 --> 01:58:22,510
也不想在服役记录中留下污点
I don't want it in the records of the battalion. There's no reason for you to have it on yours.

790
01:58:22,590 --> 01:58:26,180
这和能力或胆量无关
This has nothing to do with cowardice or inefficiency.

791
01:58:29,470 --> 01:58:31,770
看看这座丛林
Look at this jungle.

792
01:58:31,850 --> 01:58:37,190
那些藤蔓缠绕着大树 吞食一切
Look at those vines, the way they twine around the trees, swallowing everything.

793
01:58:39,610 --> 01:58:41,900
大自然很残酷
Nature's cruel, Staros.

794
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:56,710
你可以申请调到华府的军法局
I'm going to let you apply for reassignment to the Judge Advocate General Corps

795
01:58:56,790 --> 01:58:58,670
就说你生了病
for reasons of ill health.

796
01:58:58,750 --> 01:59:00,130
你是律师
You're a lawyer.

797
01:59:00,210 --> 01:59:02,590
- 你得过虐疾吗? - 没有
- You had malaria yet? - No, I haven't.

798
01:59:02,670 --> 01:59:05,050
无所谓 我会安排的
Doesn't matter. I can fix that.

799
01:59:05,130 --> 01:59:07,380
反正你会染上的
Anyway, you probably will have it.

800
01:59:08,050 --> 01:59:11,140
我也会推荐你获颁银星勋章
I'm also recommending you for the Silver Star.

801
01:59:11,220 --> 01:59:15,390
我一定会让你无法推辞
And I'll recommend it in such a way it definitely won't be refused.

802
01:59:16,310 --> 01:59:18,940
干脆也让你得紫心奖章
Might as well have the Purple Heart, too.

803
01:59:21,610 --> 01:59:23,280
为什么?
Why?

804
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:28,990
因为你脸上的疤 和手上的伤口
Because of that scratch on your face and because of those cuts on your hands.

805
01:59:29,070 --> 01:59:30,740
给我听好
Listen to me, Staros.

806
01:59:30,820 --> 01:59:34,870
你跟下一批伤兵离开
I think it's best you go back with the next batch of wounded and prisoners.

807
01:59:34,950 --> 01:59:38,750
留下来对你没好处
It is no goddamn good for you to keep hanging around.

808
01:59:38,830 --> 01:59:42,380
这件事不说出去最好
The quieter we keep this, the better it'll be for all.

809
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:19,290
这是多尔上校的宣布
This is from Colonel Tall.

810
02:00:20,790 --> 02:00:24,290
我们的胜利带来最高的荣耀
"Our victory gives us the highest reasons for pride".

811
02:00:25,380 --> 02:00:28,920
这是窝达康拉尔岛役的转捩点
"It will prove a milestone in the battle for Guadalcanal".

812
02:00:30,260 --> 02:00:35,260
明天师长会亲自来检阅前线
"Tomorrow the division commander will arrive to make an inspection of the line".

813
02:00:35,350 --> 02:00:40,600
接防部队会来换班
"After the inspection we're to be relieved by a battalion of the division's reserve regiment".

814
02:00:42,060 --> 02:00:46,320
我为全营兄弟 争取到一星期的假
"I've secured for the battalion a week's rest off the line".

815
02:00:50,570 --> 02:00:52,030
就这样
That's all.

816
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:49,560
长夜漫漫
Hours like months.

817
02:02:52,320 --> 02:02:54,400
度日如年
Days like years.

818
02:02:57,740 --> 02:02:59,820
我正值青春年华
Walked into the golden age.

819
02:03:03,790 --> 02:03:06,370
站在新世界的边缘
Stood on the shores of the New World.

820
02:03:17,300 --> 02:03:20,260
我本来想去看你们
I would've come by and paid you guys a visit,

821
02:03:20,350 --> 02:03:22,010
不过...
but...

822
02:03:25,140 --> 02:03:27,770
我想一个人静一下
I just felt like being alone, you know?

823
02:03:29,560 --> 02:03:31,650
是吗?
Yeah?

824
02:03:41,830 --> 02:03:43,910
我们要谢谢你
We wanted to thank you, sir.

825
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:50,460
要求进行包抄行动
For asking to make that flanking move.

826
02:03:52,540 --> 02:03:54,630
为我们着想
For watching out for us.

827
02:03:56,670 --> 02:03:58,760
让我们团结一致
Keeping us together.

828
02:04:03,930 --> 02:04:06,020
你不该被调走
We're all sorry to see you go.

829
02:04:06,100 --> 02:04:08,270
这不公平
We feel like you got a rotten deal.

830
02:04:10,520 --> 02:04:13,690
我并不同意
Well, I'm not sure that you're right.

831
02:04:16,440 --> 02:04:18,320
最难的是
Tough part is...

832
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:22,700
不知道这么做有没有用
not knowing if you're doing any good.

833
02:04:24,580 --> 02:04:26,660
这才是最难的
That's the hard part.

834
02:04:28,410 --> 02:04:31,040
不过无所谓 我不在乎
But it doesn't matter. I don't care.

835
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:33,960
我很高兴能离开
I'm glad to be going.

836
02:04:35,210 --> 02:04:37,170
真的很高兴
I'm glad.

837
02:04:37,260 --> 02:04:41,050
- 还是能提出申诉 - 为什么?
- There's still time. We could file a complaint. - For what?

838
02:04:42,140 --> 02:04:44,390
有什么用?
What good would that do?

839
02:04:46,100 --> 02:04:47,770
反正我想走
Anyway, I wanna go.

840
02:04:50,690 --> 02:04:53,150
别管它 算了吧
Leave it alone. Let it lay.

841
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:01,370
(希腊语)

842
02:05:05,740 --> 02:05:07,830
什么意思?
What does that mean, sir?

843
02:05:10,540 --> 02:05:12,870
你们像是我的孩子
It means "You've been like my sons".

844
02:05:24,140 --> 02:05:26,220
你们是我的孩子
You are my sons.

845
02:05:27,470 --> 02:05:29,560
我亲爱的孩子
My dear sons.

846
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:35,560
你们活在我心中
You live inside me now.

847
02:05:39,570 --> 02:05:41,650
永远与我同在
I'll carry you wherever I go.

848
02:05:57,670 --> 02:06:00,460
我忘不了战争的可怕
Can't nothing make you forget it.

849
02:06:04,180 --> 02:06:06,680
悲剧不断重演
Each time you start from scratch.

850
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:15,100
战争不能给我们荣耀
War don't ennoble men.

851
02:06:16,150 --> 02:06:18,440
只会把人变成野狗
It turns 'em into dogs.

852
02:06:24,240 --> 02:06:26,320
荼毒我们的心灵
Poisons the soul.

853
02:07:30,300 --> 02:07:32,390
亲爱的妻子
My dear wife,

854
02:07:35,140 --> 02:07:41,730
战争的丑陋和血腥暴力 会让人丧失良知
you get something twisted out of your insides by all this blood, filth, and noise.

855
02:07:51,200 --> 02:07:53,830
我很想保持纯真
I wanna stay changeless for you.

856
02:07:56,410 --> 02:07:59,420
我想以原来的我回到你身边
I wanna come back to you the man I was before.

857
02:08:07,420 --> 02:08:10,130
我们该如何获得宁静?
How do we get to those other shores?

858
02:08:13,970 --> 02:08:16,060
回到青山绿水间?
To those blue hills.

859
02:08:26,280 --> 02:08:27,940
真爱
Love.

860
02:08:37,500 --> 02:08:39,580
到底来自何方?
Where does it come from?

861
02:08:48,050 --> 02:08:50,130
谁燃起我们心中的爱火?
Who lit this flame in us?

862
02:08:57,180 --> 02:08:59,270
战争无法熄灭它
No war can put it out,

863
02:09:00,770 --> 02:09:02,850
或是征服它
conquer it.

864
02:09:10,700 --> 02:09:12,780
我曾是个囚犯
I was a prisoner.

865
02:09:17,240 --> 02:09:19,330
你让我自由
You set me free.

866
02:09:23,460 --> 02:09:26,000
不管你受过多少训练
No matter how much training you got,

867
02:09:27,130 --> 02:09:29,210
或是多么小心
how careful you are,

868
02:09:30,590 --> 02:09:34,050
只要运气不好就会阵亡
it's a matter of luck whether or not you get killed.

869
02:09:34,140 --> 02:09:39,390
不管你是谁 或是多么骁勇善战
Makes no difference who you are, or how tough a guy you might be,

870
02:09:41,430 --> 02:09:45,860
一不小心就会被杀死
if you're in the wrong spot at the wrong time, you're gonna get it.

871
02:09:56,570 --> 02:09:59,040
我看着那个人死去
I look at that boy dying,

872
02:10:00,540 --> 02:10:02,620
一点感觉都没有
I don't feel nothing.

873
02:10:05,880 --> 02:10:08,540
我对一切都不在乎
I don't care about nothing any more.

874
02:10:13,220 --> 02:10:15,300
听起来很幸福
Sounds like bliss.

875
02:10:19,760 --> 02:10:21,850
我还没有那种感觉
I don't have that feeling yet.

876
02:10:23,270 --> 02:10:25,350
麻木不仁的感觉
That numbness.

877
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:28,480
我跟你们不一样
Not like the rest of you guys.

878
02:10:32,820 --> 02:10:35,110
也许是因为我看得太多
Maybe cos I knew what to expect.

879
02:10:38,320 --> 02:10:40,580
根本就失去感觉
Maybe I was just frozen up already.

880
02:11:24,370 --> 02:11:27,870
我入伍后就没碰过女人
I haven't touched another woman since I was called up.

881
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:31,040
或跟女人说过话
Or talked to one.

882
02:11:35,050 --> 02:11:37,130
我不想...
I don't wanna...

883
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:40,390
我不想有欲念
I don't wanna feel the desire.

884
02:12:17,510 --> 02:12:19,180
亚伯罕
All right. Abrahams!

885
02:12:19,260 --> 02:12:20,930
亚伯罕 你的信
Abrahams. Here you go.

886
02:12:21,010 --> 02:12:22,890
史狄 史狄呢?
Stack! Where's Stack?

887
02:12:22,970 --> 02:12:25,010
叫他来
Bring him out.

888
02:12:25,100 --> 02:12:27,180
比尔?
Bell?

889
02:12:27,270 --> 02:12:29,140
比尔!
Bell!

890
02:12:30,190 --> 02:12:32,690
另一封是比尔的 另一封是比尔的
Another one for Bell. Another one for Bell.

891
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:37,530
亲爱的积克
Dear Jack,

892
02:12:39,320 --> 02:12:44,490
我认识一个空军上尉 我爱上他
I've met an Air Force captain. I've fallen in love with him.

893
02:12:47,200 --> 02:12:49,500
我要跟你离婚嫁给他
I want a divorce to marry him.

894
02:12:55,840 --> 02:12:59,420
你可以拒绝 但我还是要说
I know you can say no, but I'm asking you anyway,

895
02:12:59,510 --> 02:13:02,300
毕竟我们曾夫妻一场
out of the memory of what we had together.

896
02:13:09,060 --> 02:13:11,140
原谅我
Forgive me.

897
02:13:12,100 --> 02:13:14,690
我太寂寞了
It just got too lonely, Jack.

898
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,090
我们会再见
We'll meet again some day.

899
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:44,840
我们一定会再见面的
People who have been as close as we've been always meet again.

900
02:13:53,310 --> 02:13:56,150
我无权跟你这么说
I have no right to speak to you this way.

901
02:13:56,230 --> 02:13:58,520
不过我忍不住
I can't stop myself.

902
02:13:59,030 --> 02:14:01,110
习惯成自然
A habit so strong.

903
02:14:03,280 --> 02:14:05,910
你曾是我最好的朋友
Oh, my friend of all those shining years.

904
02:14:10,040 --> 02:14:12,120
帮助我离开你
Help me leave you!

905
02:15:39,220 --> 02:15:41,300
你叫什么?
What's your name?

906
02:16:53,330 --> 02:16:55,420
我们曾是一家人
We were a family.

907
02:16:58,670 --> 02:17:01,260
不得已被拆散
How'd it break up and come apart?

908
02:17:04,510 --> 02:17:08,010
现在我们自相残杀
So that now we're turned against each other.

909
02:17:09,890 --> 02:17:12,480
断送彼此的生路
Each standing in the other's light.

910
02:17:21,690 --> 02:17:24,320
我们怎么会失去善良本性?
How did we lose the good that was given us?

911
02:17:26,120 --> 02:17:28,200
泯灭天理良知
Let it slip away?

912
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,080
将人性弃之不顾
Scatter it careless?

913
02:17:53,770 --> 02:17:56,190
我们为什么无法升华?
What's keeping us from reaching out?

914
02:17:56,810 --> 02:17:58,900
达到光荣的巅峰?
Touching the glory?

915
02:18:00,940 --> 02:18:06,860
如果我是日军你早就死了
I'd have had you, Witt, if you was a Jap,Long ago.

916
02:18:08,450 --> 02:18:10,530
你得留下来?
They leave you here?

917
02:18:12,080 --> 02:18:13,580
对
Yup.

918
02:18:13,660 --> 02:18:15,750
我会拖累他们
I slowed 'em up.

919
02:18:16,420 --> 02:18:18,330
我不介意
Don't mind, really.

920
02:18:19,340 --> 02:18:22,130
医官帮我包扎得很好
The medic fixed me up pretty good.

921
02:18:22,250 --> 02:18:24,340
我有很多弹药
I got plenty of ammo.

922
02:18:27,010 --> 02:18:29,640
一定会有人来接我
Somebody'll be along for me eventually.

923
02:18:34,730 --> 02:18:37,020
- 你伤不轻 - 膝盖中弹
- They got you good. - Right in the knee.

924
02:18:37,100 --> 02:18:38,810
是啊
Yeah.

925
02:18:38,900 --> 02:18:41,480
我不必再打仗了 威特
I'm out of this war for good, Witt.

926
02:18:46,780 --> 02:18:50,370
- 你在这儿干嘛? - 只是 你知道
- What you doin' down here? - Just, you know,

927
02:18:50,450 --> 02:18:52,740
我要回到连上
I'm heading back to the company.

928
02:18:53,410 --> 02:18:55,080
好
Yeah.

929
02:18:55,910 --> 02:18:58,210
跟大伙儿问好
Well, you give all them boys my best.

930
02:18:58,290 --> 02:19:00,750
你可以跟我来
You can come with me if you want.

931
02:19:00,840 --> 02:19:02,960
我扶你
I'll help you along.

932
02:19:04,590 --> 02:19:07,170
不了 这里很好
No, it's nice and quiet.

933
02:19:07,260 --> 02:19:09,340
很安静
Peaceful up here.

934
02:19:11,720 --> 02:19:14,890
我会拖累你 剖队会接我
I'd just slow you up. There'll be somebody along.

935
02:19:18,770 --> 02:19:20,860
我会提醒他们
I'll remind 'em.

936
02:19:21,310 --> 02:19:23,400
好
OK.

937
02:20:58,620 --> 02:21:00,700
嘿 威特
Hey, Witt.

938
02:21:05,250 --> 02:21:07,420
今天你惹了什么麻烦?
Who you making trouble for today?

939
02:21:08,460 --> 02:21:10,550
什么意思?
What d'you mean?

940
02:21:11,300 --> 02:21:14,470
你不是最爱惹麻烦吗?
Well, isn't that what you like to do?

941
02:21:14,550 --> 02:21:17,220
叫你向左你偏偏向右
Turn left when they say go right?

942
02:21:24,060 --> 02:21:26,560
你为什么这么爱惹麻烦?
Why are you such a troublemaker, Witt?

943
02:21:28,980 --> 02:21:31,530
你很关心我 对吧?
You care about me, don't you, Sergeant?

944
02:21:32,900 --> 02:21:34,990
我一直都这么觉得
I always felt like you did.

945
02:21:36,820 --> 02:21:39,540
你为什么装得冷酷无情?
Why do you always make yourself out like a rock?

946
02:21:40,830 --> 02:21:43,210
有时我跟你聊得很愉快
One day I can come up and talk to you,

947
02:21:44,250 --> 02:21:48,130
隔一天 我们就像没见过面似的
by the next day it's like we never even met.

948
02:22:02,470 --> 02:22:04,560
好孤单的房子
Lonely house now.

949
02:22:07,230 --> 02:22:09,320
你会觉得孤单吗?
You ever get lonely?

950
02:22:09,400 --> 02:22:11,480
只有在人群中
Only around people.

951
02:22:13,400 --> 02:22:15,490
只有在人群中
Only around people.

952
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:23,540
你还是有美好的信念 对吧?
You still believing in the beautiful light, are you?

953
02:22:31,130 --> 02:22:33,210
你怎么办得到?
How do you do that?

954
02:22:34,880 --> 02:22:36,970
你就像是魔术师
You're a magician to me.

955
02:22:46,020 --> 02:22:48,100
你眼中仍有一丝良知
I still see a spark in you.

956
02:23:13,160 --> 02:23:18,700
有人看到死去小鸟的眼中 只有无言的痛楚
One man looks at a dying bird and thinks there's nothing but unanswered pain.

957
02:23:21,410 --> 02:23:23,500
不过死亡是无情的
But death's got the final word.

958
02:23:26,590 --> 02:23:28,670
死神在嘲笑他
It's laughing at him.

959
02:23:37,970 --> 02:23:40,470
有人看着同一只小鸟
Another man sees that same bird,

960
02:23:43,390 --> 02:23:45,480
却看到生命光辉
feels the glory.

961
02:23:50,530 --> 02:23:53,030
心中充满喜悦
Feels something smiling through him.

962
02:24:50,380 --> 02:24:52,840
我们得马上撤退
We need to get out of here right now.

963
02:24:52,920 --> 02:24:57,510
- 你跟指挥部说过吗? - 没有
- You explain to... headquarters the situation? - No.

964
02:24:57,590 --> 02:25:01,680
他们知道我们在这儿吗?
Do they know where we are? Cos we're sitting ducks out here.

965
02:25:02,850 --> 02:25:06,390
我们死定了 这要由我决定
Well, I think that's... up to me to judge, Sergeant.

966
02:25:08,020 --> 02:25:13,610
我们得派人去看敌军有多近 好吗?
I think we just need to send somebody up there and find out how close they are. OK?

967
02:25:13,690 --> 02:25:15,570
很容易
It's easy.

968
02:25:15,650 --> 02:25:19,030
韦特 联络指挥部
Hey, Weld... get headquarters on that thing.

969
02:25:19,110 --> 02:25:21,030
炮声越来越近
The fire's coming closer, sir.

970
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:22,160
没有讯号
Line's cut!

971
02:25:25,160 --> 02:25:29,330
我们得派人查出原因
We need to send somebody out there to find out where that line is being cut.

972
02:25:29,420 --> 02:25:32,040
和敌人有多近
And we need to find out how close they are.

973
02:25:32,130 --> 02:25:33,670
来吧
Come on.

974
02:25:33,750 --> 02:25:36,300
好吧 好吧
OK. OK.

975
02:25:40,430 --> 02:25:42,510
嘿 你
Hey, you.

976
02:25:43,140 --> 02:25:44,390
你去
You go.

977
02:25:45,390 --> 02:25:47,060
费夫 你要去
You're going, Fife.

978
02:25:52,690 --> 02:25:55,690
古恩 你也去
Coombs. You go, too.

979
02:25:55,780 --> 02:25:57,440
快点
Come on!

980
02:25:57,530 --> 02:26:02,070
我也去 这整个任务都不对
I'll go. I want you to know I think the whole thing's a bad idea, though.

981
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:07,200
要是他们全力进攻 我们肯定没命
If they come down here in any strength, Lieutenant, they'll knock our position to hell.

982
02:26:07,290 --> 02:26:09,750
你不必去 别人会去
You don't have to go. Others'll volunteer.

983
02:26:09,830 --> 02:26:14,960
我想要去 万一出事我要在场
No, I wanna go, sir. In case something bad happens, I wanna be there.

984
02:26:15,050 --> 02:26:17,550
好吧 顺着河走
All right. You stay by the river.

985
02:26:17,630 --> 02:26:20,550
丛林很浓密 小心点
That jungle's too thick. And be very careful.

986
02:26:20,630 --> 02:26:22,720
我会的
I will.

987
02:26:22,800 --> 02:26:24,760
祝好运 威特
Good luck, Witt.

988
02:26:24,850 --> 02:26:26,970
费夫 你没事吧?
You OK, Fife?

989
02:27:54,140 --> 02:27:56,770
敌军的增援部队
A reinforce battalion.

990
02:27:58,360 --> 02:28:00,020
我们得回去
We need to go back.

991
02:28:00,110 --> 02:28:01,990
告诉连长
Tell the lieutenant.

992
02:28:05,780 --> 02:28:07,660
走吧
Let's go.

993
02:28:24,920 --> 02:28:27,010
我中弹了
I'm hit!

994
02:29:25,940 --> 02:29:28,740
有人得留下来阻挡敌军
One of us needs to stay here and hold 'em off.

995
02:29:35,870 --> 02:29:37,960
我们不会有事的
We'll be all right.

996
02:29:42,960 --> 02:29:45,960
我的朋友活不久了
My friend here doesn't have long,

997
02:29:46,050 --> 02:29:48,970
你们回去吧
so... you go.

998
02:29:50,180 --> 02:29:51,640
快去吧
You go on ahead.

999
02:30:14,870 --> 02:30:16,950
威特
Witt!

1000
02:31:02,790 --> 02:31:04,880
他们来了
They're coming.

1001
02:31:06,340 --> 02:31:09,670
我得走了 你不要
I gotta go. I don't want you to be afraid.

1002
02:31:10,420 --> 02:31:14,590
听到枪声就躲起来 然后再顺着河走下去
Just hide out here till you hear firing, then push on down the river.

1003
02:31:14,680 --> 02:31:16,140
不
No.

1004
02:31:56,390 --> 02:32:00,060
- 古恩呢? - 快撤退 敌人来了
- Where's Coombs? - Get back. Get back, they're coming.

1005
02:32:01,020 --> 02:32:03,100
撤退
Fall back.

1006
02:32:04,600 --> 02:32:07,150
威特呢? 费夫 威特在哪儿?
Where's Witt? Fife, where's Witt?

1007
02:32:13,360 --> 02:32:15,450
费夫 威特呢?
Fife, where's Witt?

1008
02:32:19,160 --> 02:32:22,160
威特在哪儿?
Fife. Fife, where's Witt?

1009
02:33:09,160 --> 02:33:10,990
(日语)

1010
02:36:56,360 --> 02:36:58,440
你的生命光辉呢?
Where's your spark now?

1011
02:37:21,210 --> 02:37:25,300
我知道你们在喝私酿酒
Now, I know you men have been making and drinking this goddamn swipe.

1012
02:37:25,380 --> 02:37:26,640
没关系
That's OK by me.

1013
02:37:26,720 --> 02:37:28,430
一切都是谎言...
Everything a lie.

1014
02:37:28,510 --> 02:37:32,180
在我的部队可以尽管喝酒
Any man in my outfit can get as drunk as he wants to every night.

1015
02:37:32,270 --> 02:37:34,390
...你见到和听到的一切
Everything you hear and see.

1016
02:37:34,480 --> 02:37:38,650
只要能执行任务就没问题
As long as he's in shape to make reveille and carry out any assignment given.

1017
02:37:38,730 --> 02:37:42,610
要是不行...他就会有麻烦
If he can't do that, he's gonna have trouble from me.

1018
02:37:42,690 --> 02:37:46,530
- 他们都在说谎 - 我是个注重家庭的人
- So much to spew out. - I prefer to think of myself as a family man,

1019
02:37:46,610 --> 02:37:49,830
大家才会在一起
and that's what we all are here, whether we like it or not.

1020
02:37:49,910 --> 02:37:51,990
我们是一家人
We are a family.

1021
02:37:53,080 --> 02:37:55,250
我是父亲
I'm the father.

1022
02:37:55,920 --> 02:37:59,000
副连长就是母亲
Guess that makes Sergeant Welsh here the mother.

1023
02:37:59,080 --> 02:38:01,800
他们一个接一个来
They just keep coming, one after another.

1024
02:38:01,880 --> 02:38:05,170
你们都是我的孩子
That makes you all the children in this family.

1025
02:38:05,260 --> 02:38:08,800
一家之主是父亲
Now, a family can have only one head, and that is the father.

1026
02:38:08,890 --> 02:38:13,560
男主外女主内 这就是规矩
Father's the head, mother runs it. That's the way it's gonna work here.

1027
02:38:13,640 --> 02:38:17,350
- 要是你们想见我 - 我们被困在棺材里
- If any of you wanna see me about anything, - You're in a box.

1028
02:38:17,440 --> 02:38:19,560
- 只要有任何事 - 移动的棺材
- anything at all, - A moving box.

1029
02:38:19,650 --> 02:38:21,730
我都会在
you will find that I am available.

1030
02:38:21,820 --> 02:38:24,780
战争在圣诞节前不会结束
This war is not gonna be over by next Christmas.

1031
02:38:24,860 --> 02:38:27,820
还要很久才能回家
It's gonna be a long time before we get home...

1032
02:38:27,910 --> 02:38:29,990
他们要我们牺牲
They want you dead.

1033
02:38:32,370 --> 02:38:34,450
或相信他们的谎言
Or in their lie.

1034
02:38:39,670 --> 02:38:41,750
我们只有一个办法
Only one thing a man can do.

1035
02:38:44,760 --> 02:38:46,840
找到自己的出路
Find something that's his.

1036
02:38:50,090 --> 02:38:52,180
逃到属于自己的小岛
Make an island for himself.

1037
02:39:05,650 --> 02:39:08,150
我这一生若不相信上帝
If I never meet you in this life,

1038
02:39:09,570 --> 02:39:11,660
将会有所缺憾
Let me feel the lack.

1039
02:39:20,210 --> 02:39:24,630
上帝怜悯我 我就属于他
A glance from your eyes, and my life will be yours.

1040
02:40:13,760 --> 02:40:17,810
我只期望有一天能回家
Somethin' I can come back to. Some kind of foundation.

1041
02:40:17,970 --> 02:40:22,560
我不知道你有何打算 但...
I mean, I don't know what, you know, what your plans are, but...

1042
02:40:22,650 --> 02:40:26,650
吃了这么多苦 我已经觉悟
I'm determined now. I've been through the thick and thin of it.

1043
02:40:26,730 --> 02:40:30,070
我还年轻 不过经历苦难
You know, I may be young, but I've lived plenty of life.

1044
02:40:30,780 --> 02:40:33,030
我准备好好活下去
I'm ready to start living it good.

1045
02:40:33,110 --> 02:40:38,080
我爸常说 苦尽甘来
You know, my daddy always told me it's gonna get a lot worse before it gets better.

1046
02:40:38,160 --> 02:40:42,710
年轻人的日子不应该那么苦
You know, cos life ain't supposed to be that hard when you're young.

1047
02:40:42,790 --> 02:40:46,460
我猜最苦的已经熬过去了
Well, I figure after this the worst is gonna be gone.

1048
02:40:47,170 --> 02:40:50,760
往后会渐入佳境 这是我的愿望
It's time for things to get better. That's what I want.

1049
02:40:51,760 --> 02:40:53,840
一定能够实现
That's what's gonna happen.

1050
02:40:54,970 --> 02:40:57,050
我长大了
I'm getting older now.

1051
02:40:57,890 --> 02:41:00,390
我变得比较成熟
By no means old, but older.

1052
02:41:01,180 --> 02:41:04,350
我们曾经在哪里一起渡过
Where is it that we were together?

1053
02:41:07,520 --> 02:41:09,820
你们曾跟我一起生活
Who were you that I lived with?

1054
02:41:14,530 --> 02:41:16,620
你们是什么人?
Walked with?

1055
02:41:23,750 --> 02:41:25,830
是兄弟
The brother.

1056
02:41:32,340 --> 02:41:34,430
也是朋友
The friend.

1057
02:42:00,740 --> 02:42:02,830
黑暗和光明
Darkness from light.

1058
02:42:04,330 --> 02:42:06,420
仇恨和爱
Strife from love.

1059
02:42:07,580 --> 02:42:10,710
全都来自同一个心灵
Are they the workings of one mind?

1060
02:42:12,090 --> 02:42:14,840
拥有同一张脸孔吗?
The features of the same face?

1061
02:42:29,730 --> 02:42:31,820
我的灵魂
Oh, my soul,

1062
02:42:33,440 --> 02:42:35,530
让我相信上帝
Let me be in you now.

1063
02:42:41,580 --> 02:42:43,870
透过我的双眼观看世界
Look out through my eyes.

1064
02:42:45,160 --> 02:42:47,660
看着您创造的万物
Look out at the things you made.

1065
02:42:52,590 --> 02:42:54,880
散发生命光辉
All things shining.
