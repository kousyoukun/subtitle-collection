
3
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:09,920
細 細 的 紅 線

4
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,050
世上為何有這麼多戰爭？
What's this war in the heart of nature?

5
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,140
萬物為何自相殘殺？
Why does nature vie with itself?

6
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,930
陸地和海洋為何互相對抗？
The land contend with the sea?

7
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,070
大自然是否充滿仇恨？
Is there an avenging power in nature?

8
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,450
善惡是否同時存在？
Not one power, but two?

9
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,820
我記得我母親臨終前
I remember my mother when she was dying.

10
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,240
臉色蒼白 形如槁木
Looked all shrunk up and grey.

11
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,700
我問她害不害怕？
I asked her if she was afraid.

12
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,500
她只是搖搖頭
She just shook her head.

13
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,710
我不敢面對她的死亡
I was afraid to touch the death seen in her.

14
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:49,460
也不覺得她蒙主榮召是一件好事
I couldn't find nothing beautiful or up lifting about her going back to God.

15
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,900
聽說精神能永垂不朽 不過我沒見過
I heard people talk about immortality, but I ain't seen it.

16
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,790
不知道我死時會怎樣
I wondered how it'd be when I died.

17
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,840
當你知道那是最後一口氣不知道是什麼感覺
What it'd be like to know that this breath now was the last one you was ever gonna draw.

18
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,310
我希望能和她一樣坦然面對
I just hope I can meet it the same way she did.

19
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,100
跟她一樣…平靜
With the same... calm.

20
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,780
當心靈得到平靜精神就能永垂不朽
Cos that's where it's hidden - the immortality I hadn't seen.

21
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,530
這裡的小孩不會打架
Kids around here never fight.

22
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,070
有時候會
Sometimes.

23
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,160
他們在玩耍的時候
Sometimes when you see them playing

24
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,410
總是會打架
they always fight!

25
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,880
- 他怕我嗎？ - 有一點
- Is she afraid of me? - Little bit.

26
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,630
- 你怕我嗎？ - 怕
- Are you afraid of me? - Yes.

27
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,840
- 為什麼？ - 因為你看起來…
- Why? - Cos you look...

28
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,260
…像是個軍人
You look as an army!

29
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,430
- 我像軍人？ - 對
- I look army? - Yes.

30
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,270
無所謂
Well, that don't matter.

31
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,070
這不重要
It doesn't matter.

32
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,610
- 孩子累了 - 對
- Baby's tired. - Yes.

33
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,660
他遊累了就會睡
If she swims, she wants, she will sleep.

34
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,560
好 來
All right, come on. Turn around.

35
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,730
快…快…快
Go, go, go, go. Go!

36
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,650
快點…快點…
Come on, go.

37
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,660
快 快 快
Go, go, go, go!

38
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,340
威特 是美軍的巡邏艇
Witt, patrol boat!She's American.

39
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,320
它怎麼會單獨出現？
What's it doing out here all alone?

40
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,140
威特 你一點都沒變
You haven't changed at all, have you, Witt?

41
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,510
什麼也沒學到
You haven't learned a thing.

42
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,850
當別人信任你你就肯為他赴湯蹈火
All a man has to do is leave it to you, you'll put your head in the noose for him.

43
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,320
你逃過幾年兵？
How many times you been AWOL?

44
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,030
你當兵六年了
Been in the army, what? Six years now?

45
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,120
如果要學聰明
Ain't it time you smartened up and stopped being such a punk recruit?

46
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,290
現在該是時候了
I mean, if you're ever gonna.

47
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,460
我們不能都當聰明人
We can't all be smart.

48
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,550
沒錯 真可惜
No, we can't, and that's a shame.

49
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,720
看看你
Look at you.

50
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,680
你在我的連隊不能乖乖服役
Truth is, you can't take straight duty in my company.

51
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,650
你在這世上不能成為 一個好的軍人
You'll never be a real soldier, not in God's world.

52
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,030
這是C連 我是副連長
This is C Company, of which I'm First Sergeant. I run this outfit.

53
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:12,950
史塔洛上尉是連長 這裡是我話事 任何人都不可以違抗
Captain Staros, he's the CO, but I'm the guy who runs it. Nobody's gonna foul that up.

54
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,870
你只是一張吃飯的嘴
You're just another mouth for me to feed.

55
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,250
你本來要接受軍事審判
Normally, you'd be court-martialled.

56
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,840
算你好運
But I worked a deal for ya.

57
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,010
我給你另作安排
Gotta consider yourself lucky.

58
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,300
我派你到紀律部隊
I'm sending you to a disciplinary outfit.

59
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:36,810
當擔架兵 照顧傷兵
You'll be a stretcher-bearer. You'll be taking care of the wounded.

60
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,100
我能接受任何處罰
I can take anything you dish out.

61
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,520
我一個人就比你好兩倍
I'm twice the man you are.

62
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,080
在這個世界裡
In this world...

63
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,830
一個人根本微不足道
a man himself is nothing.

64
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,550
只有這一個世界
And there ain't no world but this one.

65
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,340
你錯了 副連長
You're wrong there, Top.

66
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,220
我見過另一個世界
I seen another world.

67
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:28,690
有時候我覺得這只是我的想像
Sometimes I think it was just... my imagination.

68
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,200
好
Well,

69
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,990
我和你的看法不同
then you've seen things I never will.

70
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:51,170
這個世界在自我毀滅
We're living in a world that's blowing itself to hell as fast as everybody can arrange it.

71
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:57,100
你只以隻眼開隻眼閉
In a situation like that all a man can do is shut his eyes and let nothing touch him.

72
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,260
為自己著想
Look out for himself.

73
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,240
我可能是你最好的朋友
I might be the best friend you ever had.

74
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,530
你自己都不知道
You don't even know it.

75
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,400
他憎死你了
He hates you worse than poison.

76
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,660
我不覺得他憎我 因為我不憎他
I never felt he hated me, cos I don't hate him.

77
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,700
我愛C隊的兄弟
I love Charlie Company.

78
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,750
他們是我的家人
They're my people.

79
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,430
這個島叫“頑石”
They call it "The Rock".

80
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,760
原本無人佔領 後來讓日軍蓋了機場
Nobody wants this island. Japs just put an airfield there.

81
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,720
主要戰區在這裡
Fighting's confined to this area.

82
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:28,400
這是攻擊澳洲的途徑亦是進攻美國的海道
This is their road to Australia, and this is their way of controlling the sea lanes to America.

83
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,690
若要阻止日軍攻佔南太平洋 就得在這裡開戰
If we're gonna stop the Japs' advance into the South Pacific, we've gotta do it right there.

84
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,280
海軍陸戰隊已經試過 現在輪到我們
The Marines have done their job. Now it's our turn.

85
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,830
我們將奮不顧身
Worked my ass off.

86
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,460
儘量迎合將軍
Brown-nosed the generals.

87
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,790
降低身份
Degraded myself

88
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:54,840
為他們 為我家人
for them and my family.

89
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,220
和我的家
For my home.

90
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:02,180
- 我很敬佩你 上校 - 謝謝你 長官
- I admire you, Colonel. I do. - Thank you, sir.

91
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,230
你這年紀的軍官早已退休了
Most men your age would have retired by now.

92
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,390
你是好軍人
It's OK.

93
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:12,110
部隊需要你這種成熟的長官
We need general officers with maturity and character like you.

94
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:15,570
我們有好的中士和中校
We've got good sergeants and good lieutenant colonels.

95
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:19,030
他們一當了上校 就想做將軍
But once a man gets those eagles, he can't wait to get that star.

96
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,200
於是成為政客
He becomes a politician, right?

97
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,370
只會拍上司的馬屁
Goes along to get along.

98
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:28,080
很難堅持原則
So goddamn hard to stay upright.

99
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,210
- 你說得對 長官 - 上將會注意我的表現
- You said it there, sir. - With the Admiral watching, which he will be.

100
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:35,210
- 一定有人盯著你 - 嗯
- There's always someone watching. - Yeah.

101
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,260
像只獵鷹
Like a hawk.

102
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,510
總是有人想搶你的功勞
Always someone ready to jump in, if you're not.

103
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,560
- 你有兒子嗎 上校？ - 有的 長官
- D'you have a son, Colonel? - Yes, sir.

104
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:00,240
很好 不能讓子孫打這場爛仗
Good. We don't want our sons or grandsons fighting this war 30 years from now, do we?

105
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:04,080
- 沒錯 是不能 - 那就全力攻敵
- No, sir, we sure don't. - Then you crush 'em without mercy.

106
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,200
把敵人趕盡殺絕 搶下機場
You dig them out of the hills and protect that airfield.

107
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,160
是的 長官
Yes, sir.

108
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:15,420
你有沒有想過日軍為何在這兒蓋機場？
You wonder why... Why did the Japs put an airfield there of all places?

109
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,590
我們對大局不太清楚
I guess we don't know the bigger picture, if there is such a thing.

110
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:23,760
- 你認為呢？ - 我從不想這種問題
- What do you think? - Well, sir, I never ask myself that question.

111
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,510
你很謙虛
You're a humble man.

112
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,850
沒人要這座島…除了你
Nobody wants that island... but you.

113
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,440
你有多大的決心？
How much do you want it?

114
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,940
我會全力以赴
As much as I have to, sir.

115
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,860
家人為我做的犧牲
All they sacrificed for me

116
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,660
就像覆水難收
poured out like water on the ground.

117
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,380
我本來能好好愛他們
All I might have given for love's sake.

118
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,980
太遲了
Too late.

119
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,900
我的心已死
Died...

120
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,410
像樹木一樣慢慢凋零
slow as a tree.

121
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,640
你感覺得到嗎？
D'you feel it?

122
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,440
是的 長官
Yes, sir.

123
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,650
謝謝你 長官
Thank you, sir.

124
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,640
權力越大 恐懼越深
The closer you are to Caesar, the greater the fear.

125
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,950
我就是感到害怕
I just can't help how damn scared I am, sarge, all right?

126
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,660
無法控制
I can't help it. I got...

127
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,120
小時候我繼父常用磚塊打我
My stepdaddy took a block and beat me when I was real little

128
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,000
我好怕 老是躲起來
and I was scared and I used to run, I used to hide.

129
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,750
時常睡在雞窩
Hell, I slept in the chicken coop a whole lot of nights.

130
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,010
我以為我不會再害怕
And I never thought it'd get no worse than that.

131
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,140
但是現在我分秒都在害怕
But I'm living by the... by the minute here. I'm counting the seconds.

132
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,680
馬上就要登陸一定會遭到空襲
Hell, we're gonna be landing soon and there's gonna be air raids.

133
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:53,230
我們會陣亡在灘頭
We're probably gonna die before we get off the beach.

134
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:57,320
這艘船就像漂流的墳墓
This place is... It's like a big floating graveyard.

135
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,610
- 你叫什麼 小子？ - 我退伍後想買一輛車
- What's your name, kid? - I wanna own an automobile when I get out.

136
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,870
- 你叫什麼？ - 愛德華崔恩
- What's your name? - Edward, Edward B Train.

137
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,030
崔恩？
Train?

138
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,540
只有上帝和死亡是永恆的
The only things that are permanent is, is dying and the Lord. That's it.

139
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:18,440
我只擔心這些 這場戰爭不是你我的終點
That's all you gotta worry about. This war ain't... gonna be the end of me or you neither.

140
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,860
- 會遇到空襲嗎？ - 我怎麼知道？
- Think we'll catch an air raid? - How in the hell should I know?

141
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:26,700
別的大兵說上次進攻就沒有
All's I know are them crew guys said they didn't catch no air raid the last time.

142
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:30,370
上上一次他們差點被炸死
On the other hand, time before last they nearly got blew up.

143
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,330
你要我怎麼說
What d'you want me to tell you?

144
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,460
多謝了 你什麼也沒說
You're a big help, Tills. Nothing. Tell me nothing.

145
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,010
不過我要告訴你
Tell you something.

146
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:41,680
我們在船上就像是死鴨子
We're sitting out here on this ocean like a couple of fuckin' ducks in these boats.

147
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,720
我早就知道
I already know that.

148
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,560
好好想一想 提奧
Well, brood on it, Tills.

149
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,930
好好地想
Brood on it.

150
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,440
- 不看好戲嗎？ - 沒興趣
- Ain't you watching the fun? - I ain't interested.

151
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,980
- 太迫了 - 就算不迫我也不想看
- Yeah, I guess it is pretty crowded. - Wouldn't be interested, even if it wasn't.

152
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,860
我要去拿那把手槍
Well, I'm on my way to get me that pistol.

153
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,610
是嗎？ 開心點
Yeah? Well, have fun.

154
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,910
是啊 開心點
Yeah, have fun.

155
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:07,830
有手槍才能對付日本武士刀
You'll wish you had one once we get ashore and run into some of them samurai sabres.

156
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:11,540
快開門 給我開門…
Open this door! Open this goddamn door!

157
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,500
快開門
Open the door!

158
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:39,110
我入伍時沒想到會有這下場
I never bargained for nothing like this when I signed up for this man's army before the war.

159
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:43,990
我怎麼知道會打仗？ 你倒是說說
How was I supposed to know there was gonna be a fuckin' war, huh? Answer me that.

160
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,950
我只知道C連最衰了
All I know is Charlie Company's always getting screwed. Always.

161
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,790
我也知道是誰的錯
And I can tell you whose fault it is, too.

162
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,830
就是我們的連長
It's that captain of ours.

163
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,710
他害大家被派上這艘鬼船
First he gets us stuck off on this boat where we don't know a fucking soul.

164
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:06,260
而且是第四批登陸部隊
Then he gets us stuck way down in fourth place on the list to get off this son of a bitch.

165
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,030
連長 你好
Hello, Captain.

166
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:09,740
檔案說你在戰前是軍官
I read in your 201 file that you were an officer before the war.

167
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,490
怎麼會變成二等兵？
How'd you end up a private?

168
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,660
因為我太太
Cos of my wife.

169
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,620
我本來在工兵部隊
I was in the corps of engineers.

170
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,880
我和她從來沒分開過
We'd never been separated before,

171
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,050
連一晚都沒有
not even for a night.

172
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,890
我忍受了四個月最後終於放棄
I took it for four months and then I quit.

173
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,890
辭職不幹
Just resigned.

174
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,600
我被送回美國
They sent me back to the States.

175
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,770
永遠不能當軍官
They told me I'd never get another commission.

176
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:45,530
他們說要徵召我入伍讓我當步兵
They said they'd see to it I got drafted and that I for damn sure'd be in the infantry.

177
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,240
那些渾蛋
Sons of bitches.

178
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,950
我不怪他們
No, I don't blame them.

179
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,450
她在哪裡？
Well, where is she now?

180
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,410
在家裡
She's home.

181
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,220
我並不怕死
Why should i be afraid to die?

182
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,700
因為我已屬於你
I belong to you.

183
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,400
快…快…快…
Move! Move! Move!

184
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,570
快 快
Move! Move!

185
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,950
快點…
Move! Move!

186
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,280
快 快
Moving out!

187
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:39,540
如果我先走 我會等你的
If i go first, I'll wait for you there.

188
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,290
就在死亡的另一邊
On the otherside of the dark waters.

189
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,680
貝爾 戴上頭盔
Put your helmet on.

190
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,890
你與我同在
Be with me now.

191
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,440
- 壓力很大 對吧？ - 是的 長官
- Feeling the pressure, Captain? - Yes, sir.

192
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,110
我喜歡你 上尉
I like you, Captain.

193
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,700
我要你知道我很支援你
And I just want you to know, well, we're in this thing together. All right?

194
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:21,870
你先逼近敵區 我會趕上來
Keep pressing inland till you reach the line. I'll catch up with you there.

195
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,830
- 是的 長官 - 由你全權指揮
- Yes, sir. - It's all yours, Captain.

196
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,380
讓開 讓開
Gangway! Gangway there!

197
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,920
我要過去
Coming through!

198
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,920
班長馬上報到
Squad leaders! Both teams!

199
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:33,340
在這裡
This way, son. This way, right here.

200
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,470
準備上登陸船
Stand by to go over the side!

201
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,280
我們在天上的父
Our Father, who art in heaven...

202
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:56,160
免我們的債如同我們免人的債
And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.

203
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,870
國度權柄榮耀全是您的 阿們
For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory.

204
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,640
你們很幸運
Your outfit's lucky.

205
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,810
運輸船剛被日軍發現
Transports must've been spotted.

206
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,810
幸好你們下來了
You're getting outta here just ahead of time.

207
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,900
深呼吸 你得深呼吸
Take a breath, mister. You gotta breathe!

208
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,200
- 這是C連嗎？ - 是的
- You Charlie Company? - Yeah.

209
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,060
我們深入內陸一英里 什麼也沒有
We went in a mile. Nothing there.

210
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,670
一個禮拜都沒動靜
Some oil drums. There'd be nothing there for...

211
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,180
- 一個禮拜 - 一個禮拜 長官
- A week. - A week, sir.

212
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,090
無人傷亡 日軍大概都跑了
No casualties. Japs must've hauled ass.

213
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,880
我們受迫擊炮攻擊 無人傷亡
Two mortars hit the beach, but most guys came in standing up.

214
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,760
這地方很不可思議
Darnedest thing I ever did see.

215
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,660
還有魚住在樹上
They got fish that live in trees.

216
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,830
指揮部好像沒搞清楚狀況
If they didn't know this beach was deserted, what else don't they know?

217
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,840
您化身為宇宙萬物
Who are you to live in all these many forms?

218
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,340
萬物皆難逃一死
Your death that captures all.

219
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,680
您也是生命的泉源
You, too, are the source of all that's gonna be born.

220
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,910
您充滿榮耀
Your glory.

221
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:23,290
慈悲
Mercy.

222
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,920
寧靜
Peace.

223
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,970
真理
Truth.

224
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,890
您能安撫人心
You give calm a spirit,

225
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:45,020
給人們諒解
understanding,

226
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,900
和勇氣
courage.

227
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:55,660
使人得到滿足
The contented heart.

228
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,050
醫務兵 這裡
Get a medic here!

229
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:47,850
也許每個人都有共同的靈魂 和相同的命運
Maybe all men got one big soul who everybody's a part of.

230
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,060
每張臉孔都是同一個人
All faces of the same man.

231
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,400
一個大我
One big self.

232
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,730
每個人都想獲得救贖
Everyone looking for salvation by himself.

233
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:45,070
像炭火般燃燒生命
Each like a coal drawn from the fire.

234
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,940
我們要攻上那座山頭
We're going straight up that hill there.

235
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:27,430
- 辦不到 上校 - 我們無法包抄敵軍
- We can't do that, Colonel. - Well, there's no way to outflank it.

236
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:30,440
左邊的懸崖底下是河流
On the left is a cliff that falls down into the river.

237
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,580
日軍守住叢林 我們得正面突襲
The Japanese hold the jungle. It has to be taken frontally.

238
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:39,480
食水怎麼辦？ 山上沒清水
What about water, sir? It's not getting up here.

239
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:42,210
我的兄弟都因為脫水昏倒
My men are... passing out, sir.

240
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:53,890
他們能發牢騷就能打仗
Only time you worry about a soldier is when he stops bitching.

241
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,410
並肩前進 第三排留守
We're all gonna attack abreast. Third Platoon in reserve.

242
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:14,870
我們得越過三個山丘
We've gotta cross those three folds of ground. You see?

243
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,750
然後再攻下山頭
Once we get beyond that, we gotta attack that hill.

244
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:34,600
上校說不能採取包抄攻勢 我們得正面突襲
Colonel says there's no way to outflank it, so we gotta take it head-on by frontal assault.

245
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,810
- 偉特 - 是
- Whyte? - Yeah?

246
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,900
- 看到山坡前面嗎？ - 看到了
- See the grassy ridges at the foot of that hill? - Yeah.

247
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:45,990
等你攻上山坡 找到敵軍據點然後消滅他們
When you get to the end of that field, eliminate all strong points on those ridges.

248
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,290
那兒一定有敵軍守住
I'm sure the Japs got something there to protect the approaches.

249
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,480
主啊 您在嗎？
Are you here?

250
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,870
別讓我背叛您
Let me not betray you.

251
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,670
別讓我背叛我的兄弟
Let me not betray my men.

252
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,640
您讓我充滿信心 和希望
In you I place my trust.

253
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:37,130
（希臘語）

254
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,740
玫瑰般的黎明
Rosy-fingered dawn.

255
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,660
你是希臘人
You're Greek, aren't you, Captain?

256
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,830
讀過荷馬的史詩嗎？
D'you ever read Homer?

257
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:50,420
我在西點軍校讀過希臘原文
We read Homer at the Point.In Greek.

258
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,000
有多少炮兵支援火力？
What kind of artillery support do we have, sir? Over.

259
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:58,670
- 兩組105榴彈炮 - 一點都沒有用
- Two batteries of 105s. - They won't make a dent. Over.

260
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:03,140
不過能提高士氣 日軍會被炸得很難看
No, but it bucks the men up. It'll look like the Japs are catching hell.

261
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,500
兄弟們
OK, you guys.

262
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,680
準備上吧
This is it.

263
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:03,200
每組十人攻上山頭
We're going down in groups often.

264
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:09,080
快速前進才不會成為目標
There's no point in going by rushes. Only make a better target stopped, so...

265
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,500
一路跑上去
run all the way.

266
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:14,920
我們被選上 別無選擇 非去不可
We ain't got no choice. We're picked, so we gotta go.

267
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,340
我親自帶領先鋒隊
I'm gonna take the first bunch myself.

268
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,760
我要戴爾跟著我 戴爾？
I want Charlie Dale with me. Dale?

269
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,550
叫兄弟在山坡集合
You go organise them guys that's up there.

270
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,560
五分鐘後出發
Moving out in five minutes.

271
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:36,060
走吧
Let's go.

272
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,650
施高？
Sico?

273
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:45,910
- 你怎麼了？ - 我的肚子好痛
- What's wrong with you? - I'm sick to my stomach.

274
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:49,330
起來 小心我踢扁你
Sico, you get up now, or I'll kick you so hard you're gonna be sick.

275
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:51,200
我站不起來
I can't. I would if I could.

276
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:53,620
我生病了
I'm sick.

277
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:55,580
我病了
I'm sick.

278
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,750
你沒有病 起來
You ain't sick. Get up!

279
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:05,470
- 施高 怎麼了？ - 不曉得
- What's the matter, Sico? - I don't know, Sergeant.

280
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:08,720
肚子好痛 好像是胃痙孿
It's my stomach. I'm in pain, I got cramps.

281
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,060
我病了 坐不起來
I can't even sit up straight. I'm sick.

282
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,940
- 給我起來！ - 別逼他了
- Come on, get up! - Leave him.

283
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:21,280
誰要替我拿步槍？ 我帶你找醫官
I need a volunteer to carry the BAR! Drop your gear. I'm taking you to the medics.

284
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,440
謝謝你 副連長
Thank you, Sergeant.

285
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,820
別跟我爭
Don't argue with me.

286
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:29,990
祝好運 傑克
Good luck, Keck.

287
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:58,970
也許他們撤退了
Maybe they pulled out.

288
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,350
快趴下！
Hit dirt!

289
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,680
趴下來！
Hit dirt!

290
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,520
冷靜點…冷靜點…
Calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down.

291
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,360
擔架兵
Stretcher-bearers!

292
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,710
這兒
Come on!

293
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:47,880
擔架兵 在這兒
Stretcher-bearers, this way!

294
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:52,180
- 去救那兄弟 - 已經有八 九名傷兵…
- Go get that man. - We already got eight or nine down there...

295
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:56,310
- 別跟我爭 我要救他 - 管不了他們了
- Don't argue with me! Get that man! - He's not the one we should think about...

296
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:59,690
該死 全都要救 我是指揮官
Goddamn it, all of you! Am I in command here or am I not?!

297
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:03,860
- 難道你是連長嗎？ - 我只是說別人傷得更重
- Am I the captain or a goddamn private? - Others are hit bad. That's all I meant.

298
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,950
- 二兵 聽我的命令 - 是 長官！
- I gave you an order, private! - Yes, sir!

299
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,370
你好 副連長
Hello, First Sergeant.

300
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,540
我們要救誰？
Who we going after over here?

301
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,420
應該是積克
We think it's Jacques.

302
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:21,630
積克老兄
Ol' Jockey.

303
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:24,420
真是倒楣
Well, shit. That's, that's, that's too bad.

304
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,380
長官？
Sir?

305
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:32,340
把積克抬回去我能回來嗎？
Sir? Sir, can I come back to the company after we get Jockey back to the battalion?

306
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:37,270
- 好 你要得到許可 - 當然 我的步槍
- OK, but you gotta get permission. - Sure. And my rifle.

307
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,730
力奇 你還活著
Nicky! You're still alive!

308
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:45,520
繼續前進！ 繼續前進！
Keep moving! Keep moving!

309
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:52,620
太好了 史塔奧 好久沒見到這麼猛烈的攻擊
Magnificent, Staros, magnificent. The finest thing these old eyes have seen in a long time!

310
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:57,200
你指揮得很好 我會請營長給你功勳
Beautifully conceived and executed! You'll be mentioned in battalion orders.

311
00:49:57,290 --> 00:49:59,830
偉特排長的表現也很棒
Young Whyte led beautifully.

312
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:02,000
是 長官
Yes, sir. Over.

313
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,960
派第二排增援也很聰明
But sending in your second too was brilliant.

314
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:10,550
就快攻上去了 傷亡不慘重 布蘭也不錯
They may have carried the ridge. I don't think they were hurt too bad. Blane led well, too.

315
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:13,430
他們發現多少據點？
Now, how many emplacements did they locate?

316
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,600
消滅了多少？
Did they knock any out?

317
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,730
中午就應該能攻上山頭
We ought to have those ridges cleaned out by noon! Over.

318
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:24,150
史塔奧 你在嗎？
Hello! Hello! Staros, are you there?

319
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,480
我在 長官
Here, sir. Over.

320
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:31,450
他們發現多少據點？ 消滅了多少？
I said, how many emplacements did they locate? Did they knock any out? Over.

321
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,060
孩子們
Children.

322
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:36,830
我不知道
I don't know, sir.

323
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:41,410
什麼意思？ 你怎麼會不知道？
What the hell do you mean, you don't know? How can you not know? Over.

324
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:46,160
我在第一座山丘後面
I'm right here behind the first swell, sir. I'm right here behind the swell.

325
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,360
要我站起來招手嗎？
You want me to stand up and wave? Over.

326
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:51,550
我看到了 你得想辦法
No, I can see where you are. I want you to do something.

327
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:54,840
快上去看看情況如何
I want you to get up there and see what the situation is.

328
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:57,180
今晚我就要你攻下山頭
I want Hill 210 in my hands tonight.

329
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:00,600
上將一早就要來查看
Now, goddamn it, the Admiral got up at dawn for this!

330
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,140
提起精神來 史塔奧
Come to life up there, Staros. Out!

331
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,590
上來
Move up!

332
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,400
嘿 傑克！
Hey, Keck!

333
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,490
幹嘛？
Yeah?

334
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:57,740
- 我們得撤退 - 我知道
- We gotta get out of here. - I know it.

335
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,620
布蘭死了
Blane's dead.

336
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,790
你得指揮
You're in charge.

337
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:08,880
美國佬 我們看到你們
We know you there, Yank!

338
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:11,750
東條英機去死
Tojo eats shit!

339
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,090
羅斯福去死
No! Roosevelt eats shit!

340
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,750
我打到他了 我打到他了
I got him! I got him!

341
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:12,770
我殺死一個人
I killed a man.

342
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:14,940
嘿 昆恩！
Hey, Queen!

343
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:17,530
昆恩 你在嗎？
Queen, you there?

344
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:21,660
殺人比強姦更嚴重
Worst thing you can do. Worse than rape.

345
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:24,700
看到日本鬼子離開左邊嗎？
Queen! You see them Japs leaving that left ridge?

346
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:28,620
- 沒有人能把我怎樣 - 我什麼也沒看到
- I killed a man. Nobody can touch me for it. - I ain't seen nothing.

347
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,750
抬起頭來看看
Well, get your fuckin' head up and look around!

348
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:35,300
我是說真的！
I'm serious!

349
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:39,300
有七個日兵離開左邊
I counted seven Japs leaving that left-hand grassy ridge!

350
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,890
我打中一個
I got me one of 'em.

351
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,220
又怎樣？
So?

352
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:45,560
他們可能會撤退
I think maybe they're pulling out.

353
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:51,270
也許該去告訴連長
Maybe somebody ought to go tell the captain.

354
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:52,900
你想去嗎？
You wanna be the one to do it?

355
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:01,360
我命令你別亂動
You just stay put! I'm ordering you!

356
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:26,120
趴低
Down!

357
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:36,690
趴低點
Stay low.

358
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:05,340
沖！ 沖！
Go! Go!

359
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:07,640
沖！ 沖！
Go! Go!

360
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,560
現在怎麼辦？
What do we do now?

361
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:54,810
在這兒等 也許會有人來支援
We wait right here. Maybe they'll send us up some reinforcements.

362
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,000
做什麼？
To do what?

363
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:59,480
攻下敵軍的據點呀
To capture some of these fucking positions around here!

364
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:05,030
- 你要繼續進攻？ - 不知道 不能直接進攻山頭
- You mean you really wanna go on with this? - Hell, no. No, not no uphill charge.

365
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:09,240
不過如果有支援
If they send us reinforcements, maybe we could scout around

366
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:11,870
就能試著除掉機關槍
and locate these machine guns.

367
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:15,040
- 總比冒死退回去好 - 有人來了
- Anyway, it's better than going back down. - Something's coming!

368
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,040
他們來了！
They're coming!

369
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:23,800
他們在幹什麼？
What are they doin'?

370
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,970
他們為什麼不全力進攻？
If they want to throw us out, why didn't they come in force?

371
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,460
也許他們落了單
Maybe they was acting on their own.

372
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,470
也許他們想上西天
Maybe they wanted to get into nirvana.

373
00:56:34,970 --> 00:56:36,840
敵人來了
They're coming.

374
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:47,760
怎麼回事？
Keck!

375
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:49,360
天啊
Jesus!

376
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:51,530
老天！
Oh, Jesus!

377
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,790
我炸到屁股！
I blew my butt off!

378
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:58,290
- 沒事 沒事 - 我把屁股炸掉了
- It's all right. It's all right. - I blew my butt off!

379
00:56:58,370 --> 00:56:59,830
趴下來
Lay down!

380
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,670
我怎麼會這麼衰？
What a fucking recruit trick to pull!

381
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:05,760
- 我只拔到保險制 - 寫信給我老婆
- Take it easy. Take it easy. - I grabbed it by the pin!

382
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:10,890
告訴她我死得很光榮
You write my old lady. You tell her... I want her to know I died like a man.

383
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:13,310
你不會死的 沒人給她寫 得你自己來
Nobody's gonna have to write her. You'll make it.

384
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:15,270
- 別騙我 - 下來
- Don't bullshit me! - Stay down!

385
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:17,430
嘿 嘿
Hey, hey.

386
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:20,310
我全身是泥
Have I got mud on my face?

387
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,680
幫我擦掉
Wipe it off. Get it off.

388
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,270
不
No!

389
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:28,440
我會寫信給她
I'll write her. I promise.

390
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:35,660
我的水壺還有水 拿去吧
Take my canteen. There's still some water in there.

391
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,540
也許這樣最好
It's for the best.

392
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:45,710
我的下麵被炸爛
I'm all messed up down there.

393
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,970
不能搞了
I can't fuck no more.

394
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:54,720
我在哪兒？
Whoa... Where am I?

395
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:57,850
我在哪兒？
Where am I?

396
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:02,980
你不會有事
You're gonna be all right.

397
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:07,190
就算你死了 你沒有對不起兄弟
Even if you die, you didn't let your brother down.

398
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:11,990
要是你不撲上去 我們全都會死
If you hadn't thrown yourself against that embankment, we'd all have been killed.

399
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:14,360
我好冷
I'm cold.

400
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:18,950
我好冷
I'm cold.

401
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,280
我快凍死了
I'm... freezing.

402
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:19,460
你要寫信給他老婆？
You gonna write his wife?

403
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:22,750
才不要
Fuck, no.

404
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:25,250
我又不認識她
I don't know his old lady.

405
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:30,380
那是連長的事 別傻了 我不會寫信
That's the company commander's job. You outta your mind? I ain't no good at writing.

406
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:32,550
你答應過他
You told him you would.

407
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:36,430
他快死了 我得那麼說
I'll say anything to 'em when they're like that.

408
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:39,140
有人得寫信給她
Somebody ought to do it.

409
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:42,100
你寫給她吧
Well, then, you write her. Yeah, you write her.

410
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,660
怎麼回事？
What's wrong, Jim?

411
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:18,740
他沒救了 誰也救不了他
There's nothing anybody can do for him. He'll die before they get him to a surgeon.

412
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:23,830
- 你不必去了 - 我可以替他注射嗎啡
- Then I can't ask you to go out there. - Maybe I could get some morphine into him.

413
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:27,170
- 能讓他安靜嗎？ - 不能 我可以打兩針
- Would it keep him quiet? - Not for long, but I can give him two.

414
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:30,670
留三 四針給他自己打
And I could maybe leave him three or four for himself.

415
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:35,050
你能一次打完嗎？
Couldn't you give 'em to him all at once?

416
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:55,610
你們都會死
That's what you are.

417
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:00,450
我們全都會沒命
That's all there is for us. That's us, that's us.

418
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:04,290
我的十二名弟兄都死了
I lost all twelve. I lost all twelve.

419
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:07,460
全都掛了
All twelve of 'em.

420
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:09,000
太瘋狂了
It's insanity up there.

421
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:13,170
我叫他們勇往直前
I told 'em what to do, I showed 'em where to go and I gave 'em a push.

422
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:18,590
- 救命 - 我認得你… 副連長
- Somebody help! - I know you. I know you, Sergeant.

423
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:23,390
這裡誰指揮？ 別放走他
It's insane. I don't know who's in charge here, but don't let him go! Don't let him go!

424
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:25,520
我要走 我要走
I'm outta here. I'm outta here.

425
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:29,730
兩隻腳 快走 走啊
I'm outta here. All right, move feet. Move, move, move, move. Move, move!

426
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:32,570
我要走了 我要走了…
I'm moving. I'm moving. I'm moving now.

427
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:37,320
別碰我 別看我 別碰我 別看我 我走了
Don't touch. Don't touch. Don't look at me. Don't touch. OK, I'm outta here.

428
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,410
沒事了 沒事了
All right. All right.

429
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:42,450
沒事了 沒事了
All right. All right.

430
01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:02,600
救救我
Somebody help me!

431
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:03,930
救救我！
Help me!

432
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:08,810
還好吧 小子？ 我來救你了 提拉
You gotta be quiet. I came to help you, Tella.

433
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:11,310
- 安靜點 - 去你的
- OK. Calm down. - Fuck you!

434
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,480
我快死了 我快死了
I'm dying! I'm dying, sarge!

435
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:16,990
那就安靜地等死
OK. Well, goddamn it, do it with less noise!

436
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:20,820
- 你能救我嗎？ - 我會帶你回去
- How you gonna get me out? - I'm gonna take you back.

437
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,910
- 來 - 不！
- Come on. - No!

438
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:28,580
放我下來 放我下來
Put me down! Put me down!

439
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,920
別管我 你別管我
Leave me alone... Leave me alone.

440
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:39,380
你別管我
Please, leave me alone.

441
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:49,890
給我多一點 給我多一點
Give me more. Give me more.

442
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,770
再給我多一點…
Give me more. Give me more.

443
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:55,020
再給我多一點…
Give me more. Give me more.

444
01:03:58,150 --> 01:03:59,400
來吧
Here, Tella.

445
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:10,790
再見…再見…
Goodbye... goodbye.

446
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:15,750
再見了 小子
Bye, kid.

447
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:18,840
再見 副連長
Goodbye, sarge. Goodbye.

448
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:39,070
幸好部隊不必只靠一個大兵
Fortunately, Jim, the fate of the company doesn't depend on one man.

449
01:04:43,950 --> 01:04:47,030
我用望遠鏡看到經過
Sergeant, I saw the whole thing through the glasses.

450
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:51,370
我會請營長表揚你
I'm gonna mention you in orders tomorrow and recommend you for the Silver Star.

451
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:54,080
- 我要替你爭取銀星勳章 - 長官
- It's the most courageous thing... - Captain,

452
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:58,380
你再說下去我就把你揍扁
you say one more word to thank me, I'll knock you right in the teeth.

453
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:02,170
你去爭取勳章 我馬上辭職
You mention me in your fuckin' orders, and I'll resign so fast

454
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:06,300
讓你一個人指揮這個爛部隊
and leave you here to run this busted-up outfit by yourself.

455
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:09,640
懂不懂？
You understand?

456
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:14,100
權力！ 打仗全是為了權力
Property! Whole fuckin' thing's about property.

457
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:33,530
你在搞什麼鬼？ 馬上派人支援他們
What's the matter with you, Staros? Those men should be reinforced immediately!

458
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:36,320
他們在幹嘛？
What are they doing? I can see 'em through my glasses.

459
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,230
躲在那裡做什麼？
They're lying behind that ledge!

460
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:41,840
他們應該去消滅機關槍
They should be up and out, cleaning out those machine guns! Over!

461
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:45,050
我想你不明白 長官
I don't think you understand what's going on, sir.

462
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:48,010
我們的傷亡慘重
We've had... heavy casualties.

463
01:05:48,090 --> 01:05:52,970
有一個人的腸子被打出來 死得很慘
We had a man... His gut got shot out on the slopes, sir. Created quite an upset.

464
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:56,230
好吧 到底有沒有支援？
Fine, fine. Now, what about those reinforcements? Over.

465
01:05:56,670 --> 01:06:02,150
第一排有兩個班可以支援
I have two squads to First Platoon I can send up, sir. Over.

466
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:04,650
什麼 兩個班？！
What the hell do you mean, two squads?!

467
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:08,200
該死 我叫你支援就照辦
Goddamn you, Staros! When I say reinforcements,

468
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:13,040
馬上派全體兄弟攻上去
goddamn it, I mean it! You commit everybody you have there and do it now!

469
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:17,120
第一排也得去 我看到他們躺著不動
Your First Platoon, too. I see 'em lying on their fat asses doing nothing.

470
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:22,250
派人上去 命令他們進攻 命令他們側攻
Get a man to 'em right now with orders to attack, and move 'em by the flank to the ridge.

471
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:25,130
然後叫第二排攻上山頭
Then get that Second Platoon over to the hill!

472
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:28,470
叫他們直接攻上去
Have 'em press the centre. Go straight up that goddamn hill!

473
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:30,220
馬上進攻
Attack them right now!

474
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:34,100
天啊 要我教嗎？
Jesus, Staros! Do i have to give you a lesson on infantry tactics

475
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:36,810
你的兄弟快被射死了
while your men are getting their asses shot off?.

476
01:06:36,890 --> 01:06:40,650
上校 你不明白這裡的情況
Colonel, I don't think you fully understand what is going on here.

477
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:43,940
光憑這一隊不能攻下山頭
My company alone cannot take that position, sir.

478
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:47,530
敵軍防守嚴密 火力太強
The Japs are too well dug in. They've got too much fire power.

479
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:49,700
上面有座碉堡
Colonel, there's a bunker up there.

480
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:53,160
我們看不到 它把我的兄弟打得很慘
We can't see it, and it's... it's chewing my men to pieces, sir.

481
01:06:56,330 --> 01:06:59,920
請你准許我先派人
I request permission for patrol reconnaissance around

482
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,630
進入右邊的森林搜查
to the right of Hill 210. I believe the entire position, sir,

483
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:06,340
從右邊包抄應該能攻下山頭
can be outflanked with a manoeuvre there in force.

484
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:08,720
- 不行 該死 - 挽救生命
- No! Goddamn it, no! - Might save lives!

485
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,680
不能包抄
There'll be no flanking move.

486
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,600
聽我說 你不能帶兄弟
Listen, Staros. You're not gonna take your men

487
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:17,140
躲到叢林當縮頭烏龜
around into the jungle to avoid a goddamn fight!

488
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:22,770
我要你帶領兄弟全力進攻
Do you hear me, Staros? I want you to attack right now with every man at your disposal!

489
01:07:22,990 --> 01:07:26,040
史塔奧 快進攻 這是命令
Now, attack, Staros! That's a direct order!

490
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:38,080
我必須違背你的命令
Sir, I must tell you that I refuse to obey your order.

491
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:56,510
- 在那裡 能看見嗎？ - 看不見
- There it is, right there. See it? - I don't see it.

492
01:07:57,270 --> 01:08:00,060
你沒有錯 他下了命令
This is not your fault, Jim. He's ordering you to.

493
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:09,070
我請你讓我派人到叢林搜查
I again request permission for patrol reconnaissance around to the right in force.

494
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:14,420
現在時間是…13時21分25秒
The time, sir,... is 1321 hours, 25 seconds.

495
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:19,640
兩名證人聽到我的話 請你也找證人
I have two witnesses here. I request that you do the same with witnesses there. Over.

496
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:28,020
別給我來律師那一套
Staros, don't pull this guardhouse-lawyer bullshit with me!

497
01:08:28,110 --> 01:08:32,050
你是律師 這裡卻不是法庭
Now, I know you're a goddamn lawyer! This is not a court of law.

498
01:08:32,130 --> 01:08:34,390
這是戰場 我們在打仗
This is a war. It's a goddamn battle!

499
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:39,350
我重覆 我要你正面攻擊
Now, I want that frontal attack. I repeat my order. Over.

500
01:08:40,710 --> 01:08:43,100
我拒絕率領兄弟作正面攻擊
Colonel, I refuse to take my men up there in a frontal attack.

501
01:08:43,270 --> 01:08:44,570
這等於是自殺
It's suicide, sir.

502
01:08:44,670 --> 01:08:50,610
我和他們生活兩年半 不能命令他們送死 完畢
I've lived with these men for two years, and I will not order them all to their deaths. Over.

503
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:02,410
這是很重大的決定
This is a very important decision, Staros.

504
01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:09,830
也許你有理由這麼做
But if you feel that strongly, maybe you have a reason, so I'm coming down.

505
01:09:09,910 --> 01:09:12,290
我要過去
Go take a look.

506
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:15,080
我不是取消命令
I'm not rescinding my order to you, son,

507
01:09:15,170 --> 01:09:20,010
不過如果是特殊狀況 我會仔細考慮
but if I find extenuating circumstances when I get there, I'll take that into account.

508
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:24,390
你們守在那兒等我來
Now, in the meantime, goddamn it, I want you to hold on until I get there.

509
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:28,680
可能的話叫那些兄弟前進 完畢
And, if possible, you get those men on the ridge out and moving! Out.

510
01:09:29,810 --> 01:09:31,860
（希臘語）

511
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:44,530
哪裡都一樣
One spot's as good as another, men.

512
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:46,920
根本就無處可躲
There's no place to hide.

513
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:55,710
孩子 放鬆點
Just take it easy, son. Take it easy. Take it easy.

514
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:59,170
費夫呢？
Where's... where's Fife?

515
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:01,190
在這兒 費夫
Fife? He's right here, son. Fife.

516
01:10:01,290 --> 01:10:04,180
握住我的手
Hold my hand, Fife.

517
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:07,180
握我的手
Hold my hand.

518
01:10:11,530 --> 01:10:13,530
抓住了
I got it.

519
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,440
我快死了
I'm dying, Fife.

520
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:48,530
連長…
Oh, Captain...

521
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:40,720
我被埋在棺材裡
Shut up in a tomb.

522
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,980
掀不起棺蓋
Can't lift the lid.

523
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:49,520
我的處境進退兩難
Played a role I never conceived.

524
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:53,820
穿上衣服 這不是海灘
Get that blouse on, soldier. It's not a goddamn bathing beach!

525
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:55,570
立刻穿上
Put it on right now.

526
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:59,030
你在指誰？ 去殺敵呀
What you aiming at, son? Let's go get those son of a bitches.

527
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:01,200
前進！
Move up!

528
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:14,710
你趴在這兒什麼也看不到
What are you doing laying down there where you can't see a damn thing?

529
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,600
我正在觀察 我派第一排上去
Observing, sir. Just sent First Platoon forward to the ridge.

530
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:27,310
- 這次有幾個中彈？ - 沒有
- How many of 'em were hit this time? - None, sir.

531
01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:29,480
一個都沒有？
None? Not one?

532
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:34,340
這跟你說的情況不一樣
Doesn't sound like the situation you described to me over the sound power.

533
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:39,010
五分鐘前情況改變了
Well, it's not. The situation's changed just in the last five minutes, sir.

534
01:12:42,210 --> 01:12:44,870
上尉 給我聽住
Captain, you listen to me.

535
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:47,550
我們要全力向前進攻
We're going over there and taking everybody with us.

536
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:50,270
有問題嗎？
Do you have any more complaints or demurrers?

537
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:54,900
- 現在 沒有 - 好吧 你得照我的方法
- No, sir. Not now. - All right! We're gonna do things my way!

538
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:57,220
讓我來指揮
My way! You understand that, Captain?

539
01:12:57,380 --> 01:13:01,680
大家上去 晚上得攻下來
We're taking everybody over to that ledge! We may take that ridge by nightfall!

540
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,640
上面的火力還是很強
I think the ridge is quite a way from being reduced, sir.

541
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:15,320
神啊 你到底看到什麼？
Show me how to see things the way you do.

542
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:20,860
讓我知道你看到什麼
Show me how to see things the way you do.

543
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:27,330
我們全是塵土
We're just dirt. We're just dirt.

544
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:53,440
留在這兒肯定送命
We're gonna get killed if we stay here.

545
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:56,770
比爾 帶六個弟兄
Bell, take six men

546
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:58,940
上去探查
and go see what's up there.

547
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:07,370
我們會掩護你們
And we'll cover you the best we can from down there.

548
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:28,570
好
OK.

549
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:31,160
你們留下來
You guys, you guys, stay here. OK?

550
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:34,370
我一個人去
I'm going alone.

551
01:17:13,970 --> 01:17:16,060
來吧
Come out.

552
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,480
到我的身邊
Come out where lam.

553
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:34,720
上面有…上面有…
There was a... There was a...

554
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:38,720
上面有一座碉堡
There's a bunker... up there.

555
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,640
總共有五支機關槍
It's five guns.

556
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:45,270
五支機關槍
It's five guns.

557
01:18:50,410 --> 01:18:54,570
攻下那些亂石間的碉堡
That strongpoint up there, somewhere up there around those rocks,

558
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:56,740
就能攻下這座山頭
is the key to this ridge.

559
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:01,950
比爾說得沒錯
Bell here is quite right.

560
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:06,870
日本鬼子從上面
From their knob up there, those little brown brothers can cover the whole of the ground

561
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:12,250
可以掃射一千碼內的目標 不過他們漏掉這地方
in front of this position for 1,000 yards. They've left this ledge unguarded.

562
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:16,220
這是很嚴重的錯誤 這是很嚴重的錯誤
Now, goddamn it, that's a mistake. That's a hell of a mistake.

563
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:20,470
我們得利用他們的疏忽
We need to take advantage of it before they see their error.

564
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:26,350
我知道你們筋疲力盡
All right, all right, I know you're all pretty exhausted,

565
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:29,900
這裡連清水也沒有
and we've had a hell of a time getting water up here.

566
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:33,690
對不起 我向大家道歉
For that I'm sorry. I apologise to you all.

567
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:39,490
不過明天若能攻下這座碉堡 就能佔領山頭
But if we can reduce this bunker tomorrow, I think we can take this ridge.

568
01:19:42,330 --> 01:19:44,660
有沒有人自願
So I'm asking for volunteers.

569
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:47,000
回去攻下那座碉堡
Go back up there and knock it out.

570
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:49,170
長官
Sir?

571
01:19:49,350 --> 01:19:50,950
我願意…
I'll be glad to go back up

572
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:53,570
- 身先士卒回去作戰 - 很好 比爾
- and lead the way back for a party. - Right.

573
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:55,550
- 上校 我也去 - 還有你
- I'll go, sir. - You.

574
01:19:56,810 --> 01:19:57,760
好的
All right.

575
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:02,790
- 我很想率領突擊隊 - 我正希望你去 約翰
- I'd like to lead the party, Colonel. - All right, John. I was hoping you'd say that.

576
01:20:02,810 --> 01:20:04,980
- 你來指揮 - 我要去
- You'll be in command. - I'll go, sir.

577
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:07,140
- 長官 - 你
- Sir? - You.

578
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:11,230
夠了 七個人夠多了 準備出發
All right, men, that's enough. Seven is plenty. Gather up.

579
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:19,530
史塔奧 你知道這一役有多重要嗎？
I don't know if you realise the importance of this operation, Staros.

580
01:20:21,110 --> 01:20:24,120
攻下這座島 轟炸機就能降落
Once our position is secured, we can move the bombers in.

581
01:20:24,610 --> 01:20:28,170
我們的軍隊 便有一千英里的空中攻擊力
That means air power for 1,000 miles in every direction.

582
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:32,710
窩達康拉爾島一役能決定勝負
Guadalcanal may be the turning point in the war.

583
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:37,420
- 你不同意 一定得犧牲性命？ - 不是 長官
- It'll cost lives. Is that what's troubling you? - No, sir.

584
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:43,290
我跟你說過勝利的重要
I explained to you the importance of this objective.

585
01:20:43,410 --> 01:20:46,850
你認為犧牲多少兄弟才值得？
How many men do you think it's worth? How many lives?

586
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:49,020
我不知道
I can't say, sir.

587
01:20:55,250 --> 01:21:00,160
你願意犧牲你的兄弟嗎？
Are you prepared to sacrifice the lives of any of your men in this campaign?

588
01:21:02,310 --> 01:21:04,740
多少？ 一個？ 兩個？
How many? One? Two?

589
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:07,390
二十個？
Twenty?

590
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:11,930
你的小隊一定會死人
Lives will be lost in your company, Captain.

591
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:17,690
要是你受不了 現在最好讓我知道
And if you don't have the stomach for it, now is the time to let me know.

592
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:22,480
不 你說得對 你說得都對
No, sir. You're right... about everything you said.

593
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:24,650
好吧 沒事了
Fine, fine.

594
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:26,820
好吧 長官
That's all, Captain.

595
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:30,620
還有一件事
One more thing, Staros.

596
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:35,660
你不必跟我說我說得對
It's not necessary for you to ever tell me that you think I'm right.

597
01:21:36,690 --> 01:21:37,920
沒有必要
Ever.

598
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:40,340
這是理所當然的
We'll assume it.

599
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:42,300
解散
Dismissed.

600
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:01,190
我為你感到遺憾
I feel sorry for you, kid.

601
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:04,650
- 是嗎？ - 有一點吧
- Yeah? - Yeah, a little.

602
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:10,200
這場仗會害死你
This army's gonna kill you.

603
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:19,670
你還是保佑自己好運點 別想救別人了
If you were smart, you'd take care of yourself. There's nothing you can do for anybody else.

604
01:22:20,090 --> 01:22:23,920
就算你拼命也救不了什麼人
You're just running into a burning house where nobody can be saved.

605
01:22:37,130 --> 01:22:41,610
在亂世中一個人的力量很渺小
What difference do you think you can make? One single man in all this madness.

606
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:49,570
不要白白送死
If you die, it's gonna be for nothing.

607
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,370
沒有另一個美好世界
There's not some other world out there where everything's gonna be OK.

608
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:00,540
這是唯一的世界
There's just this one.

609
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:04,540
只有這座孤島
Just this rock.

610
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:44,000
來吧 讓我死吧
Go ahead! Come on, come on.

611
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:47,210
誰能決定別人的生？
Who's deciding who's gonna live?

612
01:23:47,870 --> 01:23:50,010
誰能決定別人的死？
Who's deciding who's gonna die?

613
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:53,970
太荒謬了
This is futile!

614
01:23:56,130 --> 01:24:00,520
看看我 我身上沒有中彈
Look at me! I stand right up here and not one bullet.

615
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:03,130
毫髮未傷！
Not one shot!

616
01:24:04,130 --> 01:24:05,480
為什麼？
Why?

617
01:24:06,270 --> 01:24:08,290
他們全都死了
How come they all had to die?

618
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:12,860
我卻站在這兒 一點事也沒有
I can stand right here, I can stand right up and nothing happens to me!

619
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:35,410
我們
We.

620
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:44,040
我們在一起
We together.

621
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:56,750
合而為一
One being.

622
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:14,060
水乳交融
Flow together like water,

623
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:19,650
分不出你和我
till I can't tell you from me.

624
01:25:37,540 --> 01:25:39,620
我愛你
I drink you.

625
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:43,750
現在
Now.

626
01:25:46,090 --> 01:25:48,170
現在
Now.

627
01:26:24,970 --> 01:26:26,880
您是我的明燈
You're my light.

628
01:26:30,130 --> 01:26:32,220
我的指引
My guide.

629
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:44,750
我們在後面 要是攻破防線
John, I'll be behind you. If you wanna break through, we'll come after.

630
01:27:44,830 --> 01:27:47,380
就吹哨子通知我們沖上去
We'll charge at your whistle signal.

631
01:27:48,130 --> 01:27:50,630
去吧 去殺敵吧
All right, let's go, men. Go get 'em.

632
01:29:44,950 --> 01:29:47,040
好
OK.

633
01:29:48,450 --> 01:29:50,710
你們留在底下
Stay down, below this ledge,

634
01:29:50,790 --> 01:29:54,800
我從上面叫出敵人方位
and I'll call down the data from above.

635
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:59,470
讓炮兵密集轟炸這些岩石
Once the 81s have plastered that rock... as much as possible,

636
01:29:59,550 --> 01:30:03,350
再到大石旁找掩護
we're gonna crawl out along that big rock for cover

637
01:30:04,850 --> 01:30:06,930
然後從右翼進攻
and then flank 'em to the right.

638
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:08,890
好嗎？
OK?

639
01:30:10,390 --> 01:30:12,980
好…好
OK. OK.

640
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:38,260
方位1470…座標ER7

收到了 方位1470 座標ER7

651
01:31:21,970 --> 01:31:24,050
收到 炮兵部隊
Roger, Uncle Baker 1.

652
01:31:46,830 --> 01:31:48,080
上吧
Let's go!

653
01:32:03,510 --> 01:32:06,930
從右翼攻上山頭
OK, we're gonna continue on up the hill to the right.

654
01:32:07,010 --> 01:32:11,270
等我信號再開槍或丟手榴彈
Nobody fire or throw the grenades till I give the signal.

655
01:32:11,350 --> 01:32:13,430
好 咱們上
OK, let's do it.

656
01:32:28,070 --> 01:32:31,040
他沒事吧？
Is he OK? ls he all right?

657
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:33,500
不能把他帶走 怎麼辦？
What we gonna do? Can't take him with us.

658
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:37,630
- 不能把他留下來 - 你們是同隊兄弟 你陪他
- No, we can't leave him here. - He's from your platoon. You stay with him.

659
01:32:37,710 --> 01:32:41,710
我們回來再接他…如果他還活著
We can leave him and pick him up on the way back,... if he's still alive.

660
01:32:45,590 --> 01:32:48,010
- 他死了嗎？ - 還沒有
- Is he dead? - Not yet.

661
01:32:48,090 --> 01:32:51,680
陪著他 掩護我們 沖吧
Dale, stay with him! Cover our flank! Move!

662
01:33:16,410 --> 01:33:17,500
小心後面
Behind you!

663
01:33:32,930 --> 01:33:35,020
我們被打得好慘
We're pinned down!

664
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:07,050
撤退
Fall back!

665
01:34:12,010 --> 01:34:13,470
走吧
Go!

666
01:35:24,580 --> 01:35:26,670
小心
Watch out.

667
01:36:05,290 --> 01:36:06,750
安全了！
Clear!

668
01:36:58,970 --> 01:37:01,060
給我滾出來
Come on. Get out.

669
01:37:02,430 --> 01:37:04,520
出來
Go on.

670
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:09,610
你想殺我們？
Think you're soldiers?

671
01:37:16,610 --> 01:37:18,860
你這人渣
You piece of shit!

672
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:27,000
狗娘養的
Son of a bitch!

673
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:29,170
狗娘養的
Son of a bitch!

674
01:37:48,190 --> 01:37:50,270
如何？
All right?

675
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:55,110
我殺死一個人
I shot a man.

676
01:38:30,350 --> 01:38:32,440
這裡好臭
Stinks around here.

677
01:38:33,650 --> 01:38:37,190
- 這麼多死人 - 鼻孔裡塞煙頭
- All these dead people. - Put a cigarette up your nose.

678
01:40:00,580 --> 01:40:01,950
看他們逃命！
Look at 'em move!

679
01:40:02,130 --> 01:40:03,770
看他們逃命！
Look at 'em move!

680
01:40:03,890 --> 01:40:05,570
把他們趕跑了
We got 'em on the run!

681
01:40:05,660 --> 01:40:08,870
約翰 幹得好 你把他們打得落花流水
Way to go, John. When they saw you make that attack and win,

682
01:40:08,950 --> 01:40:11,340
兄弟們都士氣高漲
you put their hearts back into them.

683
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:13,790
- 嘿 嘿 - 別打了
- Hey, hey! - Don't do that, soldier.

684
01:40:13,870 --> 01:40:18,710
把犯人帶來 交給情報部 他們馬上就來
Take care of the others. G-2 will want them. There'll be somebody around before long.

685
01:40:18,790 --> 01:40:21,260
浪費了很多時間 走吧
We've wasted enough time here. Let's go.

686
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:24,090
我要推薦一些人接受勳章
Sir, I've a few recommendations for decorations.

687
01:40:24,170 --> 01:40:27,720
我會盡力向他們爭取 但是遲些再說
Yes. We'll get everything for all of 'em that we can, but later.

688
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:32,270
不過我要你知道 我會推薦你接受勳章
Meantime, I want you to know I'm personally recommending you for something, John.

689
01:40:32,350 --> 01:40:33,810
也許是英勇獎章
Perhaps the big one.

690
01:40:33,890 --> 01:40:36,980
-  謝謝你 不過我… - 這是你應得的
- Thank you, sir, but I don't feel... - Yes, you do, John.

691
01:40:37,060 --> 01:40:39,900
能不能爭取到才是問題
Getting it for you will be the goddamn problem!

692
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:44,400
你能受勳對部隊有很大鼓舞
But, hell, it'd be a big thing for the battalion and the regiment, if you did get it.

693
01:40:44,490 --> 01:40:46,150
最好趕快前進
We better move out.

694
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:50,780
加入別的部隊攻上山頭
We need to extend our lines, hook up with the other companies and push on to the top.

695
01:40:50,870 --> 01:40:53,830
你想指揮B隊嗎？
Would you like to take command of Baker Company?

696
01:40:53,910 --> 01:40:54,960
當然想
Of course.

697
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:59,490
我不想掃你的興 但是沒有食水…
Sir, I don't mean to be a wet blanket, but about the water. If we don't get water...

698
01:40:59,550 --> 01:41:01,740
別擔心水的問題
Don't worry about water.

699
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:08,490
現在士氣如虹 不能中斷
John, I don't want anything to break up this attack of ours now we have the momentum.

700
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:12,430
過幾個小時就有食用水
We'll have some water in a... couple of hours.

701
01:41:12,570 --> 01:41:14,290
我會安排的
I've arranged for that.

702
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:18,420
該死 現在不能停下來
Now, we just can't stop now, goddamn it, and wait for it.

703
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:20,380
是的 長官
No, sir.

704
01:41:20,460 --> 01:41:22,670
沒錯
That's right.

705
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:28,560
如果有些人因脫水昏倒 那就讓他們昏倒
And if some of the men... pass out, why, hell, they'll just have to pass out.

706
01:41:32,350 --> 01:41:34,230
好吧
All right.

707
01:41:34,310 --> 01:41:35,770
他們會死的
They could...

708
01:41:35,850 --> 01:41:39,190
他們也會被敵人殺死
They could die from it.They could die from enemy fire, too!

709
01:41:40,530 --> 01:41:42,820
他們很堅強
They're all tough boys.

710
01:41:47,570 --> 01:41:52,700
兄弟們 走吧 一路上會有更多死人
Come on, men, let's go! You'll see plenty more of those where we're going!

711
01:41:52,790 --> 01:41:55,370
到底要不要上山頭？
Are we going up this hill or aren't we?

712
01:41:59,250 --> 01:42:03,220
我相信現在能突破日軍防線
John, I'm convinced that the Japanese position can be broken now.

713
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:08,390
只要繼續前進 日落時就能攻下山頭
All we have to do is keep going and we'll have this hill. We'll have this hill by sundown.

714
01:42:08,470 --> 01:42:11,470
看到他們全新的鬥志嗎？
You see the spirit in these men? D'you see the new spirit?

715
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:15,960
我們得一鼓作氣 乘勝追擊
Well, I want to take advantage of that before something happens to sap their strength.

716
01:42:16,810 --> 01:42:20,530
要是稍微遲疑就會戰敗
To have this battalion relieved in a defeat,

717
01:42:20,940 --> 01:42:22,980
或者是根本
or even to have it reinforced from troops

718
01:42:23,030 --> 01:42:26,700
攻不上山頭
 from the reserves,if we were to stall before reaching the top, well,

719
01:42:26,780 --> 01:42:31,030
天啊 我不能忍受失敗
Jesus Christ, that's just a hell of a lot more than I could stand!

720
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:33,500
我等了一輩子
I've waited all my life for this.

721
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:38,130
一直以來忍氣吞聲 都是為了這一刻
I've worked, slaved, eaten... oh, untold buckets of shit to have this opportunity!

722
01:42:38,210 --> 01:42:40,670
我不會半途而廢
And I don't intend to give it up now.

723
01:42:44,250 --> 01:42:47,510
你不知道被忽略的感受
You don't know what it feels like to be passed over.

724
01:42:48,110 --> 01:42:50,760
你剛出軍校 還很年輕
I mean, you're young. You're just out of the Academy.

725
01:42:50,850 --> 01:42:56,520
你生對時代了 我等了十五年才等到這場戰爭
You're, you know, you've got your war! This 15 years, this is my first war!

726
01:43:01,690 --> 01:43:05,320
有一天你會瞭解
John, some day you'll understand.

727
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:13,290
我把你當兒子看待
You're like a son to me, John.

728
01:43:15,660 --> 01:43:17,750
知道我兒子做什麼嗎？
You know what my son does?

729
01:43:18,670 --> 01:43:20,750
他做魚餌生意
He's a bait salesman.

730
01:43:24,020 --> 01:43:25,420
你幹得很好
You've done a hell of a job, John.

731
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:30,390
我要讓你得到應得的榮譽
I'm gonna make sure that you get everything, everything that you deserve.

732
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:33,740
謝謝你 長官
Thank you, sir.

733
01:43:36,810 --> 01:43:37,980
天啊…
God...

734
01:43:39,370 --> 01:43:42,440
該死 我要三名傳令兵
Goddamn it! I want three runners!

735
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:44,190
給我三名傳令兵
Get me three runners!

736
01:43:44,270 --> 01:43:46,530
回去找水源
You go back to the rear to find water

737
01:43:46,610 --> 01:43:49,490
馬上運過來
and get back here with it as fast as you can!

738
01:43:50,410 --> 01:43:53,620
一小時後就全力進攻
We attack in one hour! We'll throw everything we got at 'em.

739
01:43:53,700 --> 01:43:56,200
不能失敗 沒人能阻止
We're going all the way! Nothing'll stop us.

740
01:43:56,290 --> 01:43:58,370
晚上就得成功
It's high ground by nightfall!

741
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:25,070
你看過死人嗎？
You seen many dead people?

742
01:44:25,860 --> 01:44:27,820
很多
Plenty.

743
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:30,530
跟死狗沒兩樣
They're no different than dead dogs,

744
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:33,320
只要有這種想法
once you get used to the idea.

745
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:40,250
他們就像豬肉一樣
They're meat, kid.

746
01:44:56,300 --> 01:44:59,270
你們代表正義和善良嗎？
Are you righteous? Kind?

747
01:45:02,350 --> 01:45:04,520
你們是否有信心？
Does your confidence lie in this?

748
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:10,030
受到大家愛護？
Are you loved by all?

749
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:14,410
我跟你們一樣
Know that I was, too.

750
01:45:17,890 --> 01:45:22,560
你們認為自己所受的苦難 是比較少嗎？
Do you imagine your sufferings will be less because you loved goodness?

751
01:45:23,190 --> 01:45:25,280
我們善良有良知
Truth?

752
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:26,850
趴下來 趴下來
Get fucking on the ground! Get down! Get down!

753
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:29,690
趴下來 呆著
Get down. Stay there.

754
01:49:38,150 --> 01:49:42,030
給我趴下來 快點
Get on the ground! Get on the fucking ground!

755
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:43,990
快！
Now!

756
01:50:43,620 --> 01:50:45,700
這麼可怕的邪惡
This great evil.

757
01:50:48,460 --> 01:50:50,540
它來自哪裡？
Where's it come from?

758
01:50:55,210 --> 01:50:57,300
怎麼會潛伏在世上？
How'd it steal into the world?

759
01:51:09,060 --> 01:51:12,610
原因和根源到底是什麼？
What seed, what root did it grow from?

760
01:51:17,530 --> 01:51:19,610
這是誰造成的？
Who's doing this?

761
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:24,280
誰在屠殺眾生
Who's killing us?

762
01:51:28,250 --> 01:51:30,750
剝奪我們的生命之火
Robbing us of life and light.

763
01:51:35,330 --> 01:51:38,920
嘲笑我們對人間的依戀
Mocking us with the sight of what we might have known.

764
01:52:04,910 --> 01:52:07,620
戰爭對地球有利嗎？
Does our ruin benefit the Earth?

765
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:13,630
它能滋長萬物 孕育眾生嗎？
Does it help the grass to grow or the sun to shine?

766
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:22,090
上帝也有黑暗的一面？
Is this darkness in you, too?

767
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:30,890
他是否也感受邪惡力量？
Have you passed through this night?

768
01:52:37,110 --> 01:52:39,650
我要把你開膛剖肚
I'm gonna sink my teeth into your liver.

769
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:45,450
你死定了
You're dying.

770
01:52:57,380 --> 01:52:59,500
看到那些鳥嗎？
See them birds up there?

771
01:53:01,260 --> 01:53:03,550
它們會把你生吞活剝
You know they eat you raw?

772
01:53:08,470 --> 01:53:11,640
你下地獄就回不來
Where you're going, you're not coming back from.

773
01:53:17,910 --> 01:53:21,100
（日語）

774
01:54:23,130 --> 01:54:25,550
你對我有意義嗎？
What are you to me?

775
01:54:31,010 --> 01:54:33,100
毫無義意
Nothing.

776
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:56,410
坐下來
Have a seat here.

777
01:57:06,670 --> 01:57:09,460
史塔奧 我要將你革職
Staros, I'm relieving you of your command.

778
01:57:13,270 --> 01:57:15,220
班中尉會取代你
Lieutenant Band will take over for you.

779
01:57:17,090 --> 01:57:19,010
我跟他說了
I already told him.

780
01:57:29,580 --> 01:57:31,690
我也不想這麼做
It's a hard thing to do.

781
01:57:32,490 --> 01:57:34,570
這是很困難的決定
Difficult decision to make.

782
01:57:38,500 --> 01:57:39,870
你的心不夠狠
I don't think you're tough enough.

783
01:57:41,530 --> 01:57:46,370
你心太軟了 不夠心狠手辣
You're too soft. You're just too soft-hearted. You're not tough-fibred enough.

784
01:57:51,160 --> 01:57:54,880
我的心意已定 沒什麼好說
Anyway, it's my decision to make. I've already made it.

785
01:57:56,680 --> 01:57:58,580
我不想讓我的兄弟送死
I don't like to see my men get killed, sir.

786
01:58:06,180 --> 01:58:08,820
有人曾死在你懷裡嗎？
Have you ever had anyone die in your arms, sir?

787
01:58:09,650 --> 01:58:10,770
有嗎？
Have you?

788
01:58:25,050 --> 01:58:27,540
我不想引起事端
I don't see any reason to make a scandal out of this.

789
01:58:27,620 --> 01:58:33,050
也不想在服役記錄中留下污點
I don't want it in the records of the battalion. There's no reason for you to have it on yours.

790
01:58:33,130 --> 01:58:36,720
這和能力或膽量無關
This has nothing to do with cowardice or inefficiency.

791
01:58:40,010 --> 01:58:41,740
看看這座叢林
Look at this jungle.

792
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:47,730
那些藤蔓纏繞著大樹 吞食一切
Look at those vines, the way they twine around the trees, swallowing everything.

793
01:58:50,270 --> 01:58:52,440
大自然很殘酷
Nature's cruel, Staros.

794
01:59:01,700 --> 01:59:07,250
你可以申請調到華府的軍法局
I'm going to let you apply for reassignment to the Judge Advocate General Corps

795
01:59:07,330 --> 01:59:09,210
就說你生了病
for reasons of ill health.

796
01:59:09,290 --> 01:59:10,670
你是律師
You're a lawyer.

797
01:59:10,750 --> 01:59:13,130
- 你得過虐疾嗎？ - 沒有
- You had malaria yet? - No, I haven't.

798
01:59:13,210 --> 01:59:15,590
無所謂 我會安排的
Doesn't matter. I can fix that.

799
01:59:15,670 --> 01:59:17,920
反正你會染上的
Anyway, you probably will have it.

800
01:59:18,590 --> 01:59:21,680
我也會推薦你獲頒銀星勳章
I'm also recommending you for the Silver Star.

801
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:25,930
我一定會讓你無法推辭
And I'll recommend it in such a way it definitely won't be refused.

802
01:59:27,030 --> 01:59:29,480
乾脆也讓你得紫心獎章
Might as well have the Purple Heart, too.

803
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:33,820
為什麼？
Why?

804
01:59:34,150 --> 01:59:39,530
因為你臉上的疤 和手上的傷口
Because of that scratch on your face and because of those cuts on your hands.

805
01:59:39,860 --> 01:59:41,280
給我聽好
Listen to me, Staros.

806
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:45,410
你跟下一批傷兵離開
I think it's best you go back with the next batch of wounded and prisoners.

807
01:59:45,490 --> 01:59:49,290
留下來對你沒好處
It is no goddamn good for you to keep hanging around.

808
01:59:49,370 --> 01:59:52,920
這件事不說出去最好
The quieter we keep this, the better it'll be for all.

809
02:00:27,580 --> 02:00:29,830
這是多爾上校的宣佈
This is from Colonel Tall.

810
02:00:31,330 --> 02:00:34,830
我們的勝利帶來最高的榮耀
"Our victory gives us the highest reasons for pride".

811
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:39,460
這是窩達康拉爾島役的轉捩點
"It will prove a milestone in the battle for Guadalcanal".

812
02:00:41,010 --> 02:00:45,800
明天師長會親自來檢閱前線
"Tomorrow the division commander will arrive to make an inspection of the line".

813
02:00:46,770 --> 02:00:51,520
接防部隊會來換班
"After the inspection we're to be relieved by a battalion of the division's reserve regiment".

814
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:56,860
我為全營兄弟 爭取到一星期的假
"I've secured for the battalion a week's rest off the line".

815
02:01:01,850 --> 02:01:02,980
就這樣
That's all.

816
02:02:58,460 --> 02:03:00,490
長夜漫漫
Hours like months.

817
02:03:02,860 --> 02:03:04,940
度日如年
Days like years.

818
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:10,360
我正值青春年華
Walked into the golden age.

819
02:03:14,240 --> 02:03:16,910
站在新世界的邊緣
Stood on the shores of the New World.

820
02:03:27,700 --> 02:03:29,920
我本來想去看你們
I would've come by and paid you guys a visit,

821
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:31,650
不過…
but...

822
02:03:35,680 --> 02:03:38,310
我想一個人靜一下
I just felt like being alone, you know?

823
02:03:39,780 --> 02:03:40,770
是嗎？
Yeah?

824
02:03:52,370 --> 02:03:54,450
我們要謝謝你
We wanted to thank you, sir.

825
02:03:58,500 --> 02:04:01,000
要求進行包抄行動
For asking to make that flanking move.

826
02:04:03,260 --> 02:04:05,170
為我們著想
For watching out for us.

827
02:04:07,210 --> 02:04:08,640
讓我們團結一致
Keeping us together.

828
02:04:14,470 --> 02:04:16,230
你不該被調走
We're all sorry to see you go.

829
02:04:16,430 --> 02:04:18,200
這不公平
We feel like you got a rotten deal.

830
02:04:21,060 --> 02:04:24,230
我並不同意
Well, I'm not sure that you're right.

831
02:04:27,110 --> 02:04:28,860
最難的是
Tough part is...

832
02:04:30,780 --> 02:04:32,730
不知道這麼做有沒有用
not knowing if you're doing any good.

833
02:04:35,120 --> 02:04:36,460
這才是最難的
That's the hard part.

834
02:04:38,950 --> 02:04:41,580
不過無所謂 我不在乎
But it doesn't matter. I don't care.

835
02:04:42,620 --> 02:04:44,500
我很高興能離開
I'm glad to be going.

836
02:04:45,750 --> 02:04:47,710
真的很高興
I'm glad.

837
02:04:47,800 --> 02:04:51,030
- 還是能提出申訴 - 為什麼？
- There's still time. We could file a complaint. - For what?

838
02:04:52,680 --> 02:04:54,240
有什麼用？
What good would that do?

839
02:04:57,290 --> 02:04:58,590
反正我想走
Anyway, I wanna go.

840
02:05:01,230 --> 02:05:02,800
別管它 算了吧
Leave it alone. Let it lay.

841
02:05:09,580 --> 02:05:11,400
（希臘語）

842
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:17,970
什麼意思？
What does that mean, sir?

843
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:22,890
你們像是我的孩子
It means "You've been like my sons".

844
02:05:34,680 --> 02:05:36,760
你們是我的孩子
You are my sons.

845
02:05:38,010 --> 02:05:39,710
我親愛的孩子
My dear sons.

846
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:45,670
你們活在我心中
You live inside me now.

847
02:05:49,910 --> 02:05:52,000
永遠與我同在
I'll carry you wherever I go.

848
02:06:08,210 --> 02:06:10,430
我忘不了戰爭的可怕
Can't nothing make you forget it.

849
02:06:14,720 --> 02:06:17,220
悲劇不斷重演
Each time you start from scratch.

850
02:06:22,930 --> 02:06:25,640
戰爭不能給我們榮耀
War don't ennoble men.

851
02:06:26,590 --> 02:06:28,880
只會把人變成野狗
It turns 'em into dogs.

852
02:06:34,680 --> 02:06:36,760
荼毒我們的心靈
Poisons the soul.

853
02:07:40,840 --> 02:07:42,830
親愛的妻子
My dear wife,

854
02:07:45,730 --> 02:07:52,170
戰爭的醜陋和血腥暴力 會讓人喪失良知
you get something twisted out of your insides by all this blood, filth, and noise.

855
02:08:01,640 --> 02:08:04,270
我很想保持純真
I wanna stay changeless for you.

856
02:08:06,850 --> 02:08:09,860
我想以原來的我回到你身邊
I wanna come back to you the man I was before.

857
02:08:17,860 --> 02:08:20,570
我們該如何獲得寧靜？
How do we get to those other shores?

858
02:08:24,410 --> 02:08:26,500
回到青山綠水間？
To those blue hills.

859
02:08:37,250 --> 02:08:38,380
真愛
Love.

860
02:08:47,940 --> 02:08:50,020
到底來自何方？
Where does it come from?

861
02:08:58,490 --> 02:09:00,570
誰燃起我們心中的愛火？
Who lit this flame in us?

862
02:09:07,620 --> 02:09:09,710
戰爭無法熄滅它
No war can put it out,

863
02:09:11,210 --> 02:09:13,290
或是征服它
conquer it.

864
02:09:21,020 --> 02:09:23,220
我曾是個囚犯
I was a prisoner.

865
02:09:27,540 --> 02:09:29,770
你讓我自由
You set me free.

866
02:09:34,110 --> 02:09:36,440
不管你受過多少訓練
No matter how much training you got,

867
02:09:37,570 --> 02:09:39,650
或是多麼小心
how careful you are,

868
02:09:41,030 --> 02:09:44,490
只要運氣不好就會陣亡
it's a matter of luck whether or not you get killed.

869
02:09:44,580 --> 02:09:49,830
不管你是誰 或是多麼驍勇善戰
Makes no difference who you are, or how tough a guy you might be,

870
02:09:51,870 --> 02:09:55,230
一不小心就會被殺死
if you're in the wrong spot at the wrong time, you're gonna get it.

871
02:10:07,010 --> 02:10:09,170
我看著那個人死去
I look at that boy dying,

872
02:10:10,980 --> 02:10:12,740
一點感覺都沒有
I don't feel nothing.

873
02:10:16,320 --> 02:10:18,510
我對一切都不在乎
I don't care about nothing any more.

874
02:10:23,660 --> 02:10:25,740
聽起來很幸福
Sounds like bliss.

875
02:10:30,260 --> 02:10:32,290
我還沒有那種感覺
I don't have that feeling yet.

876
02:10:33,710 --> 02:10:35,790
麻木不仁的感覺
That numbness.

877
02:10:36,840 --> 02:10:38,920
我跟你們不一樣
Not like the rest of you guys.

878
02:10:43,260 --> 02:10:45,550
也許是因為我看得太多
Maybe cos I knew what to expect.

879
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:51,020
根本就失去感覺
Maybe I was just frozen up already.

880
02:11:34,810 --> 02:11:37,500
我入伍後就沒碰過女人
I haven't touched another woman since I was called up.

881
02:11:39,520 --> 02:11:41,120
或跟女人說過話
Or talked to one.

882
02:11:45,490 --> 02:11:47,570
我不想…
I don't wanna...

883
02:11:48,420 --> 02:11:50,130
我不想有欲念
I don't wanna feel the desire.

884
02:12:28,180 --> 02:12:29,620
亞伯罕
All right. Abrahams!

885
02:12:29,700 --> 02:12:31,370
亞伯罕 你的信
Abrahams. Here you go.

886
02:12:31,450 --> 02:12:33,090
史狄 史狄呢？
Stack! Where's Stack?

887
02:12:33,140 --> 02:12:34,460
叫他來
Bring him out.

888
02:12:35,640 --> 02:12:36,710
比爾？
Bell?

889
02:12:37,710 --> 02:12:39,060
比爾！
Bell!

890
02:12:40,630 --> 02:12:43,130
另一封是比爾的 另一封是比爾的
Another one for Bell. Another one for Bell.

891
02:12:45,770 --> 02:12:47,160
親愛的積克
Dear Jack,

892
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:54,930
我認識一個空軍上尉 我愛上他
I've met an Air Force captain. I've fallen in love with him.

893
02:12:57,640 --> 02:12:59,940
我要跟你離婚嫁給他
I want a divorce to marry him.

894
02:13:06,280 --> 02:13:09,860
你可以拒絕 但我還是要說
I know you can say no, but I'm asking you anyway,

895
02:13:09,950 --> 02:13:12,740
畢竟我們曾夫妻一場
out of the memory of what we had together.

896
02:13:19,500 --> 02:13:21,040
原諒我
Forgive me.

897
02:13:22,540 --> 02:13:25,130
我太寂寞了
It just got too lonely, Jack.

898
02:13:46,100 --> 02:13:47,860
我們會再見
We'll meet again some day.

899
02:13:51,320 --> 02:13:55,280
我們一定會再見面的
People who have been as close as we've been always meet again.

900
02:14:03,990 --> 02:14:06,590
我無權跟你這麼說
I have no right to speak to you this way.

901
02:14:06,670 --> 02:14:08,960
不過我忍不住
I can't stop myself.

902
02:14:09,470 --> 02:14:11,550
習慣成自然
A habit so strong.

903
02:14:13,720 --> 02:14:16,570
你曾是我最好的朋友
Oh, my friend of all those shining years.

904
02:14:20,480 --> 02:14:22,560
幫助我離開你
Help me leave you!

905
02:15:49,660 --> 02:15:51,740
你叫什麼？
What's your name?

906
02:17:04,050 --> 02:17:05,730
我們曾是一家人
We were a family.

907
02:17:09,110 --> 02:17:11,700
不得已被拆散
How'd it break up and come apart?

908
02:17:14,980 --> 02:17:18,450
現在我們自相殘殺
So that now we're turned against each other.

909
02:17:20,480 --> 02:17:22,920
斷送彼此的生路
Each standing in the other's light.

910
02:17:32,170 --> 02:17:34,760
我們怎麼會失去善良本性？
How did we lose the good that was given us?

911
02:17:36,560 --> 02:17:38,640
泯滅天理良知
Let it slip away?

912
02:17:41,440 --> 02:17:43,520
將人性棄之不顧
Scatter it careless?

913
02:18:04,210 --> 02:18:06,630
我們為什麼無法昇華？
What's keeping us from reaching out?

914
02:18:07,250 --> 02:18:09,340
達到光榮的巔峰？
Touching the glory?

915
02:18:11,500 --> 02:18:17,300
如果我是日軍你早就死了
I'd have had you, Witt, if you was a Jap,Long ago.

916
02:18:18,890 --> 02:18:20,970
你得留下來？
They leave you here?

917
02:18:22,520 --> 02:18:24,020
對
Yup.

918
02:18:24,100 --> 02:18:26,190
我會拖累他們
I slowed 'em up.

919
02:18:26,860 --> 02:18:28,770
我不介意
Don't mind, really.

920
02:18:29,780 --> 02:18:32,570
醫官幫我包紮得很好
The medic fixed me up pretty good.

921
02:18:33,230 --> 02:18:34,780
我有很多彈藥
I got plenty of ammo.

922
02:18:37,640 --> 02:18:40,080
一定會有人來接我
Somebody'll be along for me eventually.

923
02:18:45,170 --> 02:18:47,460
- 你傷不輕 - 膝蓋中彈
- They got you good. - Right in the knee.

924
02:18:47,540 --> 02:18:49,250
是啊
Yeah.

925
02:18:49,340 --> 02:18:51,920
我不必再打仗了 威特
I'm out of this war for good, Witt.

926
02:18:57,220 --> 02:19:00,810
- 你在這兒幹嘛？ - 只是 你知道
- What you doin' down here? - Just, you know,

927
02:19:00,890 --> 02:19:03,180
我要回到連上
I'm heading back to the company.

928
02:19:03,850 --> 02:19:05,520
好
Yeah.

929
02:19:06,680 --> 02:19:08,650
跟大夥兒問好
Well, you give all them boys my best.

930
02:19:09,080 --> 02:19:11,190
你可以跟我來
You can come with me if you want.

931
02:19:11,740 --> 02:19:13,400
我扶你
I'll help you along.

932
02:19:15,030 --> 02:19:17,610
不了 這裡很好
No, it's nice and quiet.

933
02:19:18,120 --> 02:19:19,780
很安靜
Peaceful up here.

934
02:19:22,260 --> 02:19:25,330
我會拖累你 剖隊會接我
I'd just slow you up. There'll be somebody along.

935
02:19:29,250 --> 02:19:30,580
我會提醒他們
I'll remind 'em.

936
02:19:31,750 --> 02:19:32,890
好
OK.

937
02:21:08,940 --> 02:21:11,140
嘿 威特
Hey, Witt.

938
02:21:15,690 --> 02:21:17,860
今天你惹了什麼麻煩？
Who you making trouble for today?

939
02:21:18,900 --> 02:21:20,990
什麼意思？
What d'you mean?

940
02:21:21,740 --> 02:21:24,160
你不是最愛惹麻煩嗎？
Well, isn't that what you like to do?

941
02:21:25,240 --> 02:21:27,320
叫你向左你偏偏向右
Turn left when they say go right?

942
02:21:34,500 --> 02:21:37,000
你為什麼這麼愛惹麻煩？
Why are you such a troublemaker, Witt?

943
02:21:39,420 --> 02:21:41,970
你很關心我 對吧？
You care about me, don't you, Sergeant?

944
02:21:43,340 --> 02:21:45,430
我一直都這麼覺得
I always felt like you did.

945
02:21:47,500 --> 02:21:49,980
你為什麼裝得冷酷無情？
Why do you always make yourself out like a rock?

946
02:21:51,270 --> 02:21:54,070
有時我跟你聊得很愉快
One day I can come up and talk to you,

947
02:21:54,690 --> 02:21:58,790
隔一天 我們就像沒見過面似的
by the next day it's like we never even met.

948
02:22:12,910 --> 02:22:15,000
好孤單的房子
Lonely house now.

949
02:22:17,670 --> 02:22:19,760
你會覺得孤單嗎？
You ever get lonely?

950
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:21,810
只有在人群中
Only around people.

951
02:22:23,680 --> 02:22:25,240
只有在人群中
Only around people.

952
02:22:30,560 --> 02:22:33,980
你還是有美好的信念 對吧？
You still believing in the beautiful light, are you?

953
02:22:41,570 --> 02:22:43,650
你怎麼辦得到？
How do you do that?

954
02:22:45,320 --> 02:22:47,410
你就像是魔術師
You're a magician to me.

955
02:22:56,460 --> 02:22:58,540
你眼中仍有一絲良知
I still see a spark in you.

956
02:23:23,730 --> 02:23:28,450
有人看到死去小鳥的眼中 只有無言的痛楚
One man looks at a dying bird and thinks there's nothing but unanswered pain.

957
02:23:32,160 --> 02:23:34,170
不過死亡是無情的
But death's got the final word.

958
02:23:37,230 --> 02:23:38,730
死神在嘲笑他
It's laughing at him.

959
02:23:48,600 --> 02:23:50,910
有人看著同一只小鳥
Another man sees that same bird,

960
02:23:54,190 --> 02:23:55,920
卻看到生命光輝
feels the glory.

961
02:24:01,240 --> 02:24:03,270
心中充滿喜悅
Feels something smiling through him.

962
02:25:00,970 --> 02:25:03,280
我們得馬上撤退
We need to get out of here right now.

963
02:25:03,810 --> 02:25:07,950
- 你跟指揮部說過嗎？ - 沒有
- You explain to... headquarters the situation? - No.

964
02:25:08,030 --> 02:25:12,120
他們知道我們在這兒嗎？
Do they know where we are? Cos we're sitting ducks out here.

965
02:25:13,640 --> 02:25:16,830
我們死定了 這要由我決定
Well, I think that's... up to me to judge, Sergeant.

966
02:25:18,460 --> 02:25:24,050
我們得派人去看敵軍有多近 好嗎？
I think we just need to send somebody up there and find out how close they are. OK?

967
02:25:24,410 --> 02:25:25,850
很容易
It's easy.

968
02:25:26,320 --> 02:25:29,920
韋特 聯絡指揮部
Hey, Weld... get headquarters on that thing.

969
02:25:29,980 --> 02:25:31,470
炮聲越來越近
The fire's coming closer, sir.

970
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:32,740
沒有訊號
Line's cut!

971
02:25:35,600 --> 02:25:39,770
我們得派人查出原因
We need to send somebody out there to find out where that line is being cut.

972
02:25:40,230 --> 02:25:42,630
和敵人有多近
And we need to find out how close they are.

973
02:25:43,080 --> 02:25:44,110
來吧
Come on.

974
02:25:45,500 --> 02:25:47,390
好吧 好吧
OK. OK.

975
02:25:51,240 --> 02:25:53,390
嘿 你
Hey, you.

976
02:25:54,270 --> 02:25:55,430
你去
You go.

977
02:25:56,800 --> 02:25:57,860
費夫 你要去
You're going, Fife.

978
02:26:03,350 --> 02:26:06,130
古恩 你也去
Coombs. You go, too.

979
02:26:07,150 --> 02:26:08,170
快點
Come on!

980
02:26:08,420 --> 02:26:13,130
我也去 這整個任務都不對
I'll go. I want you to know I think the whole thing's a bad idea, though.

981
02:26:13,270 --> 02:26:17,750
要是他們全力進攻 我們肯定沒命
If they come down here in any strength, Lieutenant, they'll knock our position to hell.

982
02:26:17,820 --> 02:26:20,360
你不必去 別人會去
You don't have to go. Others'll volunteer.

983
02:26:20,410 --> 02:26:25,800
我想要去 萬一出事我要在場
No, I wanna go, sir. In case something bad happens, I wanna be there.

984
02:26:25,890 --> 02:26:28,390
好吧 順著河走
All right. You stay by the river.

985
02:26:28,470 --> 02:26:31,390
叢林很濃密 小心點
That jungle's too thick. And be very careful.

986
02:26:31,470 --> 02:26:33,560
我會的
I will.

987
02:26:33,640 --> 02:26:34,980
祝好運 威特
Good luck, Witt.

988
02:26:35,480 --> 02:26:36,970
費夫 你沒事吧？
You OK, Fife?

989
02:28:04,980 --> 02:28:06,570
敵軍的增援部隊
A reinforce battalion.

990
02:28:09,200 --> 02:28:10,860
我們得回去
We need to go back.

991
02:28:11,390 --> 02:28:12,830
告訴連長
Tell the lieutenant.

992
02:28:17,380 --> 02:28:18,500
走吧
Let's go.

993
02:28:35,760 --> 02:28:37,050
我中彈了
I'm hit!

994
02:29:36,660 --> 02:29:39,580
有人得留下來阻擋敵軍
One of us needs to stay here and hold 'em off.

995
02:29:46,570 --> 02:29:48,800
我們不會有事的
We'll be all right.

996
02:29:53,600 --> 02:29:56,600
我的朋友活不久了
My friend here doesn't have long,

997
02:29:56,690 --> 02:29:59,610
你們回去吧
so... you go.

998
02:30:01,540 --> 02:30:02,770
快去吧
You go on ahead.

999
02:30:25,410 --> 02:30:26,710
威特
Witt!

1000
02:31:13,430 --> 02:31:14,850
他們來了
They're coming.

1001
02:31:16,980 --> 02:31:20,310
我得走了 你不要
I gotta go. I don't want you to be afraid.

1002
02:31:21,160 --> 02:31:25,910
聽到槍聲就躲起來 然後再順著河走下去
Just hide out here till you hear firing, then push on down the river.

1003
02:31:25,970 --> 02:31:26,780
不
No.

1004
02:32:07,030 --> 02:32:10,700
- 古恩呢？ - 快撤退 敵人來了
- Where's Coombs? - Get back. Get back, they're coming.

1005
02:32:11,660 --> 02:32:12,840
撤退
Fall back.

1006
02:32:15,240 --> 02:32:17,560
威特呢？ 費夫 威特在哪兒？
Where's Witt? Fife, where's Witt?

1007
02:32:24,100 --> 02:32:25,680
費夫 威特呢？
Fife, where's Witt?

1008
02:32:29,800 --> 02:32:32,800
威特在哪兒？
Fife. Fife, where's Witt?

1009
02:33:20,110 --> 02:33:21,630
（日語）

1010
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,080
你的生命光輝呢？
Where's your spark now?

1011
02:37:31,940 --> 02:37:35,610
我知道你們在喝私釀酒
Now, I know you men have been making and drinking this goddamn swipe.

1012
02:37:36,020 --> 02:37:37,280
沒關係
That's OK by me.

1013
02:37:37,670 --> 02:37:39,070
一切都是謊言…
Everything a lie.

1014
02:37:39,150 --> 02:37:42,820
在我的部隊可以儘管喝酒
Any man in my outfit can get as drunk as he wants to every night.

1015
02:37:42,910 --> 02:37:45,030
…你見到和聽到的一切
Everything you hear and see.

1016
02:37:45,120 --> 02:37:49,400
只要能執行任務就沒問題
As long as he's in shape to make reveille and carry out any assignment given.

1017
02:37:49,450 --> 02:37:53,250
要是不行…他就會有麻煩
If he can't do that, he's gonna have trouble from me.

1018
02:37:53,330 --> 02:37:57,170
- 他們都在說謊 - 我是個注重家庭的人
- So much to spew out. - I prefer to think of myself as a family man,

1019
02:37:57,250 --> 02:38:00,470
大家才會在一起
and that's what we all are here, whether we like it or not.

1020
02:38:00,740 --> 02:38:02,630
我們是一家人
We are a family.

1021
02:38:03,720 --> 02:38:05,380
我是父親
I'm the father.

1022
02:38:06,560 --> 02:38:08,780
副連長就是母親
Guess that makes Sergeant Welsh here the mother.

1023
02:38:09,720 --> 02:38:12,570
他們一個接一個來
They just keep coming, one after another.

1024
02:38:12,610 --> 02:38:15,810
你們都是我的孩子
That makes you all the children in this family.

1025
02:38:16,140 --> 02:38:19,440
一家之主是父親
Now, a family can have only one head, and that is the father.

1026
02:38:19,660 --> 02:38:23,140
男主外女主內 這就是規矩
Father's the head, mother runs it. That's the way it's gonna work here.

1027
02:38:24,730 --> 02:38:28,190
- 要是你們想見我 - 我們被困在棺材裡
- If any of you wanna see me about anything, - You're in a box.

1028
02:38:28,260 --> 02:38:30,810
- 只要有任何事 - 移動的棺材
- anything at all, - A moving box.

1029
02:38:30,930 --> 02:38:32,640
我都會在
you will find that I am available.

1030
02:38:33,480 --> 02:38:35,420
戰爭在耶誕節前不會結束
This war is not gonna be over by next Christmas.

1031
02:38:35,500 --> 02:38:37,930
還要很久才能回家
It's gonna be a long time before we get home...

1032
02:38:38,550 --> 02:38:40,630
他們要我們犧牲
They want you dead.

1033
02:38:43,010 --> 02:38:45,090
或相信他們的謊言
Or in their lie.

1034
02:38:50,310 --> 02:38:52,390
我們只有一個辦法
Only one thing a man can do.

1035
02:38:55,400 --> 02:38:57,480
找到自己的出路
Find something that's his.

1036
02:39:00,920 --> 02:39:02,820
逃到屬於自己的小島
Make an island for himself.

1037
02:39:16,350 --> 02:39:18,790
我這一生若不相信上帝
If I never meet you in this life,

1038
02:39:20,310 --> 02:39:22,300
將會有所缺憾
Let me feel the lack.

1039
02:39:30,850 --> 02:39:35,270
上帝憐憫我 我就屬於他
A glance from your eyes, and my life will be yours.

1040
02:40:24,400 --> 02:40:27,770
我只期望有一天能回家
Somethin' I can come back to. Some kind of foundation.

1041
02:40:28,610 --> 02:40:32,790
我不知道你有何打算 但…
I mean, I don't know what, you know, what your plans are, but...

1042
02:40:33,610 --> 02:40:37,290
吃了這麼多苦 我已經覺悟
I'm determined now. I've been through the thick and thin of it.

1043
02:40:37,370 --> 02:40:40,710
我還年輕 不過經歷苦難
You know, I may be young, but I've lived plenty of life.

1044
02:40:41,420 --> 02:40:43,670
我準備好好活下去
I'm ready to start living it good.

1045
02:40:43,990 --> 02:40:48,720
我爸常說 苦盡甘來
You know, my daddy always told me it's gonna get a lot worse before it gets better.

1046
02:40:48,810 --> 02:40:53,350
年輕人的日子不應該那麼苦
You know, cos life ain't supposed to be that hard when you're young.

1047
02:40:53,620 --> 02:40:57,100
我猜最苦的已經熬過去了
Well, I figure after this the worst is gonna be gone.

1048
02:40:57,810 --> 02:41:01,400
往後會漸入佳境 這是我的願望
It's time for things to get better. That's what I want.

1049
02:41:02,400 --> 02:41:04,480
一定能夠實現
That's what's gonna happen.

1050
02:41:05,610 --> 02:41:07,690
我長大了
I'm getting older now.

1051
02:41:08,950 --> 02:41:11,030
我變得比較成熟
By no means old, but older.

1052
02:41:11,820 --> 02:41:14,990
我們曾經在哪裡一起渡過
Where is it that we were together?

1053
02:41:18,160 --> 02:41:20,460
你們曾跟我一起生活
Who were you that I lived with?

1054
02:41:25,310 --> 02:41:27,260
你們是什麼人？
Walked with?

1055
02:41:34,390 --> 02:41:36,470
是兄弟
The brother.

1056
02:41:42,980 --> 02:41:45,070
也是朋友
The friend.

1057
02:42:11,530 --> 02:42:13,470
黑暗和光明
Darkness from light.

1058
02:42:14,830 --> 02:42:17,060
仇恨和愛
Strife from love.

1059
02:42:18,220 --> 02:42:21,350
全都來自同一個心靈
Are they the workings of one mind?

1060
02:42:22,730 --> 02:42:25,480
擁有同一張臉孔嗎？
The features of the same face?

1061
02:42:40,290 --> 02:42:42,460
我的靈魂
Oh, my soul,

1062
02:42:44,080 --> 02:42:46,170
讓我相信上帝
Let me be in you now.

1063
02:42:52,220 --> 02:42:54,510
透過我的雙眼觀看世界
Look out through my eyes.

1064
02:42:55,800 --> 02:42:58,300
看著您創造的萬物
Look out at the things you made.

1065
02:43:03,230 --> 02:43:05,520
散發生命光輝
All things shining.
