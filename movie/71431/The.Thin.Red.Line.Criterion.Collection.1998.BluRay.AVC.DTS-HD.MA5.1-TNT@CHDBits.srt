万物为何自相残杀?

4
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,270
陆地和海洋为何互相对抗?
{\ren}The land contend with the sea?

5
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,410
大自然是否充满仇恨?
{\ren}Is there an avenging power in nature?

6
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,790

我问她害不害怕?

10
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,840
她只是摇摇头
{\ren}She just shook her head.

11
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,050
我不敢面对她的死亡
{\ren}I was afraid to touch the death seen in her.

12
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:49,800
也不觉得她蒙主荣召是一件好事
{\ren}I couldn't find nothing beautiful or up lifting about her going back to God.

13
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:57,240
听说精神能永垂不朽 不过我没见过
{\ren}I heard people talk about immortality, but I ain't seen it.

14
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,130
不知道我死时会怎样
{\ren}I wondered how it'd be when I died.

15
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,180

什么也没学到
{\ren}You haven't learned a thing.

40
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:19,190
当别人信任你你就肯为他赴汤蹈火
{\ren}All a man has to do is leave it to you, you'll put your head in the noose for him.

41
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,660
你逃过几年兵?
{\ren}How many times you been AWOL?

如果要学聪明
{\ren}Ain't it time you smartened up and stopped being such a punk recruit?

44
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,630
现在该是时候了
{\ren}I mean, if you're ever gonna.

45
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,800
我们不能都当聪明人
{\ren}We can't all be smart.

46
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,890
没错 真可惜
{\ren}No, we can't, and that's a shame.

看看你
{\ren}Look at you.

48
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:57,020
你在我的连队不能乖乖服役
{\ren}Truth is, you can't take straight duty in my company.

49
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,990
你在这世上不能成为 一个好的军人
{\ren}You'll never be a real soldier, not in God's world.

50

你只是一张吃饭的嘴
{\ren}You're just another mouth for me to feed.

53
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,590
你本来要接受军事审判

54
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,180

55

58
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,440
我能接受任何处罚
{\ren}I can take anything you dish out.

59
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,860
我一个人就比你好两倍
{\ren}I'm twice the man you are.

60
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,420
在这个世界里
{\ren}In this world...

61
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:02,170
一个人根本微不足道
{\ren}a man himself is nothing.

62
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,890
只有这一个世界
{\ren}And there ain't no world but this one.

63
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,680
你错了 副连长

64

00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,330
我和你的看法不同
{\ren}then you've seen things I never will.

68
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:51,510
这个世界在自我毁灭
{\ren}We're living in a world that's blowing itself to hell as fast as everybody can arrange it.

69
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:57,440
你只以只眼开只眼闭
{\ren}In a situation like that all a man can do is shut his eyes and let nothing touch him.

70
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,600
为自己着想
{\ren}Look out for himself.

71
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,580

他憎死你了
{\ren}He hates you worse than poison.

74
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,000

他们是我的家人
{\ren}They're my people.

77
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,870
这个岛叫"顽石"
{\ren}They call it "The Rock".

78
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,200
原本无人占领 后来让日军盖了机场
{\ren}Nobody wants this island. Japs just put an airfield there.

79
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,160
主要战区在这里
{\ren}Fighting's confined to this area.

80
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:28,840
这是攻击澳洲的途径亦是进攻美国的海道
{\ren}This is their road to Australia, and this is their way of controlling the sea lanes to America.

81
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:34,130
若要阻止日军攻占南太平洋 就得在这里开战
{\ren}If we're gonna stop the Japs' advance into the South Pacific, we've gotta do it right there.

82
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,720
海军陆战队已经试过 现在轮到我们
{\ren}The Marines have done their job. Now it's our turn.

85
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,230
降低身份
{\ren}Degraded myself

00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,280
为他们 为我家人
{\ren}for them and my family.

{\ren}- I admire you, Colonel. I do. - Thank you, sir.

89

你这年纪的军官早已退休了
{\ren}Most men your age would have retired by now.

90
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,830
你是好军人
{\ren}It's OK.

91
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,550
部队需要你这种成熟的长官
{\ren}We need general officers with maturity and character like you.

92
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,010
我们有好的中士和中校
{\ren}We've got good sergeants and good lieutenant colonels.

93
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:19,470
他们一当了上校 就想做将军
{\ren}But once a man gets those eagles, he can't wait to get that star.

94
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,640
于是成为政客
{\ren}He becomes a politician, right?

95
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,810
只会拍上司的马屁
{\ren}Goes along to get along.

96
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,520
很难坚持原则
{\ren}So goddamn hard to stay upright.

97
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,650
- 你说得对 长官 - 上将会注意我的表现
{\ren}- You said it there, sir. - With the Admiral watching, which he will be.

98
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,650
- 一定有人盯着你 - 嗯
{\ren}- There's always someone watching. - Yeah.

99
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,700
像只猎鹰
{\ren}Like a hawk.

100
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,950
总是有人想抢你的功劳
{\ren}Always someone ready to jump in, if you're not.

101
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,380
- 你有儿子吗 上校? - 有的 长官
{\ren}- D'you have a son, Colonel? - Yes, sir.

102
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:00,890
很好 不能让子孙打这场烂仗
{\ren}Good. We don't want our sons or grandsons fighting this war 30 years from now, do we?

103
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:04,520
- 没错 是不能 - 那就全力攻敌
{\ren}- No, sir, we sure don't. - Then you crush 'em without mercy.

104
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,640
把敌人赶尽杀绝 抢下机场
{\ren}You dig them out of the hills and protect that airfield.

105
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,600
是的 长官
{\ren}Yes, sir.

106
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:15,860
你有没有想过日军为何在这儿盖机场?
{\ren}You wonder why... Why did the Japs put an airfield there of all places?

107
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,030
我们对大局不太清楚
{\ren}I guess we don't know the bigger picture, if there is such a thing.

108
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:24,200
- 你认为呢? - 我从不想这种问题
{\ren}- What do you think? - Well, sir, I never ask myself that question.

109
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,950
你很谦虚
{\ren}You're a humble man.

110
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,290
没人要这座岛...除了你
{\ren}Nobody wants that island... but you.

111
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,880
你有多大的决心?
{\ren}How much do you want it?

112
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,380
我会全力以赴
{\ren}As much as I have to, sir.

113
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,300
家人为我做的牺牲
{\ren}All they sacrificed for me

114
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,100
就像覆水难收
{\ren}poured out like water on the ground.

115
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,820
我本来能好好爱他们
{\ren}All I might have given for love's sake.

116
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,420
太迟了
{\ren}Too late.

117
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,340
我的心已死
{\ren}Died...

118
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,850
像树木一样慢慢凋零
{\ren}slow as a tree.

119
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,180
你感觉得到吗?
{\ren}D'you feel it?

120
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,980
是的 长官
{\ren}Yes, sir.

121
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,190
谢谢你 长官
{\ren}Thank you, sir.

122
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,180
权力越大 恐惧越深
{\ren}The closer you are to Caesar, the greater the fear.

123
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,490
我就是感到害怕
{\ren}I just can't help how damn scared I am, sarge, all right?

124
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,200
无法控制
{\ren}I can't help it. I got...

125
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,660
小时候我继父常用砖块打我
{\ren}My stepdaddy took a block and beat me when I was real little

126
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,540
我好怕 老是躲起来
{\ren}and I was scared and I used to run, I used to hide.

127
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,290
时常睡在鸡窝
{\ren}Hell, I slept in the chicken coop a whole lot of nights.

128
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,550
我以为我不会再害怕
{\ren}And I never thought it'd get no worse than that.

129
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,680
但是现在我分秒都在害怕
{\ren}But I'm living by the... by the minute here. I'm counting the seconds.

130
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,220
马上就要登陆一定会遭到空袭
{\ren}Hell, we're gonna be landing soon and there's gonna be air raids.

131
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,770
我们会阵亡在滩头
{\ren}We're probably gonna die before we get off the beach.

132
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:57,860
这艘船就像漂流的坟墓
{\ren}This place is... It's like a big floating graveyard.

133
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:02,150

崔恩?
{\ren}Train?

136
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:13,080
只有上帝和死亡是永恒的
{\ren}The only things that are permanent is, is dying and the Lord. That's it.

137
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:19,080
我只担心这些 这场战争不是你我的终点
{\ren}That's all you gotta worry about. This war ain't... gonna be the end of me or you neither.

138
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:22,500
- 会遇到空袭吗? - 我怎么知道?
{\ren}- Think we'll catch an air raid? - How in the hell should I know?

139
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:27,340
别的大兵说上次进攻就没有
{\ren}All's I know are them crew guys said they didn't catch no air raid the last time.

140
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:31,010

{\ren}On the other hand, time before last they nearly got blew up.

141
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,970
你要我怎么说
{\ren}What d'you want me to tell you?

142
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,100
多谢了 你什么也没说
{\ren}You're a big help, Tills. Nothing. Tell me nothing.

143

不过我要告诉你
{\ren}Tell you something.

144
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:42,320
我们在船上就像是死鸭子
{\ren}We're sitting out here on this ocean like a couple of fuckin' ducks in these boats.

145
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,360
我早就知道
{\ren}I already know that.

146
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,200
好好想一想 提奥

好好地想

{\ren}- Yeah, I guess it is pretty crowded. - Wouldn't be interested, even if it wasn't.

150
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,500
我要去拿那把手枪
{\ren}Well, I'm on my way to get me that pistol.

151
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,250

153
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:08,470
有手枪才能对付日本武士刀
{\ren}You'll wish you had one once we get ashore and run into some of them samurai sabres.

154

快开门
{\ren}Open the door!

156
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:39,750
我入伍时没想到会有这下场
{\ren}I never bargained for nothing like this when I signed up for this man's army before the war.

157
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:44,630
我怎么知道会打仗? 你倒是说说
{\ren}How was I supposed to know there was gonna be a fuckin' war, huh? Answer me that.

158
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,590
我只知道C连最衰了
{\ren}All I know is Charlie Company's always getting screwed. Always.

159
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,430
我也知道是谁的错
{\ren}And I can tell you whose fault it is, too.

160
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,470
就是我们的连长
{\ren}It's that captain of ours.

161
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,350
他害大家被派上这艘鬼船
{\ren}First he gets us stuck off on this boat where we don't know a fucking soul.

162
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,900
而且是第四批登陆部队
{\ren}Then he gets us stuck way down in fourth place on the list to get off this son of a bitch.

163
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,670
连长 你好
{\ren}Hello, Captain.

164
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:10,380
档案说你在战前是军官
{\ren}I read in your 201 file that you were an officer before the war.

165
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,130
怎么会变成二等兵?
{\ren}How'd you end up a private?

166
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,300
因为我太太
{\ren}Cos of my wife.

167
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,260
我本来在工兵部队
{\ren}I was in the corps of engineers.

168

169
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,690
连一晚都没有
{\ren}not even for a night.

170
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,530
我忍受了四个月最后终于放弃
{\ren}I took it for four months and then I quit.

171
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,530
辞职不干

172
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:37,240
我被送回美国
{\ren}They sent me back to the States.

173
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,410
永远不能当军官
{\ren}They told me I'd never get another commission.

174
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:46,170
他们说要徵召我入伍让我当步兵
{\ren}They said they'd see to it I got drafted and that I for damn sure'd be in the infantry.

175
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,880
那些浑蛋
{\ren}Sons of bitches.

176
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,590

在家里
{\ren}She's home.

179
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,860
我并不怕死
{\ren}Why should i be afraid to die?

180
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,950
因为我已属于你

{\ren}If i go first, I'll wait for you there.

186
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,930

{\ren}Two mortars hit the beach, but most guys came in standing up.

212

还有鱼住在树上
{\ren}They got fish that live in trees.

214
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,270
指挥部好像没搞清楚状况
{\ren}If they didn't know this beach was deserted, what else don't they know?

215
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:07,280

232
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:20,380
我们要攻上那座山头

233
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:28,140
- 办不到 上校 - 我们无法包抄敌军

左边的悬崖底下是河流
{\ren}On the left is a cliff that falls down into the river.

235
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:35,020

{\ren}The Japanese hold the jungle. It has to be taken frontally.

236
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:40,150

{\ren}What about water, sir? It's not getting up here.

237
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,650
我的兄弟都因为脱水昏倒
{\ren}My men are... passing out, sir.

238
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:54,330

{\ren}Only time you worry about a soldier is when he stops bitching.

239
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,850
并肩前进 第三排留守
{\ren}We're all gonna attack abreast. Third Platoon in reserve.

240
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:15,310

00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,190
然后再攻下山头
{\ren}Once we get beyond that, we gotta attack that hill.

{\ren}When you get to the end of that field, eliminate all strong points on those ridges.

246
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,730
那儿一定有敌军守住
{\ren}I'm sure the Japs got something there to protect the approaches.

247
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,920

玫瑰般的黎明

257

300
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,070
积克老兄
{\ren}Ol' Jockey.

301
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:24,860

303
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:32,780

304
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:37,710
- 好 你要得到许可 - 当然 我的步枪

{\ren}Beautifully conceived and executed! You'll be mentioned in battalion orders.

309
00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:00,270

311
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,400
派第二排增援也很聪明
{\ren}But sending in your second too was brilliant.

312
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:10,990
就快攻上去了 伤亡不惨重 布兰也不错
{\ren}They may have carried the ridge. I don't think they were hurt too bad. Blane led well, too.

313
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:13,870
他们发现多少据点?
{\ren}Now, how many emplacements did they locate?

314
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:16,040
消灭了多少?
{\ren}Did they knock any out?

315
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:20,170
中午就应该能攻上山头

{\ren}I said, how many emplacements did they locate? Did they knock any out? Over.

319
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:34,350
孩子们
{\ren}Children.

320
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:37,270

{\ren}I don't know, sir.

321
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:41,850

{\ren}I want Hill 210 in my hands tonight.

327
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:01,040
上将一早就要来查看
{\ren}Now, goddamn it, the Admiral got up at dawn for this!

328
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,580

00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,230
你得指挥
{\ren}You're in charge.

335
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:09,320
美国佬 我们看到你们
{\ren}We know you there, Yank!

336
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:12,190
东条英机去死
{\ren}Tojo eats shit!

337
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,530
罗斯福去死

343
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:25,140

- 没有人能把我怎样 - 我什么也没看到
{\ren}- I killed a man. Nobody can touch me for it. - I ain't seen nothing.

345
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:32,190
抬起头来看看
{\ren}Well, get your fuckin' head up and look around!

346
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:35,740
我是说真的!

347
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:39,740
有七个日兵离开左边

348
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,330

351
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:51,710
也许该去告诉连长
{\ren}Maybe somebody ought to go tell the captain.

352
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:53,340
你想去吗?
{\ren}You wanna be the one to do it?

353
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,800
我命令你别乱动
{\ren}You just stay put! I'm ordering you!

354
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:26,370
趴低
{\ren}Down!

355
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:37,130
趴低点
{\ren}Stay low.

356
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,780
冲! 冲!
{\ren}Go! Go!

357
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:08,080
冲! 冲!
{\ren}Go! Go!

358
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:51,000
现在怎么办?
{\ren}What do we do now?

359
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:55,250
在这儿等 也许会有人来支援
{\ren}We wait right here. Maybe they'll send us up some reinforcements.

360
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:56,790
做什么?
{\ren}To do what?

361
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,920
攻下敌军的据点呀
{\ren}To capture some of these fucking positions around here!

362
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:05,470
- 你要继续进攻? - 不知道 不能直接进攻山头
{\ren}- You mean you really wanna go on with this? - Hell, no. No, not no uphill charge.

363
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:09,220
不过如果有支援
{\ren}If they send us reinforcements, maybe we could scout around

364
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:11,390
就能试着除掉机关枪
{\ren}and locate these machine guns.

365
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:15,480
- 总比冒死退回去好 - 有人来了
{\ren}- Anyway, it's better than going back down. - Something's coming!

366
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,480
他们来了!
{\ren}They're coming!

367
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:24,240
他们在干什么?
{\ren}What are they doin'?

368
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:27,410
他们为什么不全力进攻?
{\ren}If they want to throw us out, why didn't they come in force?

369
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:29,700
也许他们落了单
{\ren}Maybe they was acting on their own.

370
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,710
也许他们想上西天
{\ren}Maybe they wanted to get into nirvana.

371
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:37,080
敌人来了
{\ren}They're coming.

372
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:48,300

趴下来
{\ren}Lay down!

378
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,110
我怎么会这么衰?
{\ren}What a fucking recruit trick to pull!

379
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:06,200
- 我只拔到保险制 - 写信给我老婆
{\ren}- Take it easy. Take it easy. - I grabbed it by the pin!

380
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:11,330
告诉她我死得很光荣
{\ren}You write my old lady. You tell her... I want her to know I died like a man.

381
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:13,750
你不会死的 没人给她写 得你自己来
{\ren}Nobody's gonna have to write her. You'll make it.

382
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:15,710
- 别骗我 - 下来
{\ren}- Don't bullshit me! - Stay down!

383
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:17,870
嘿 嘿
{\ren}Hey, hey.

384
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,750
我全身是泥
{\ren}Have I got mud on my face?

385
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,920
帮我擦掉
{\ren}Wipe it off. Get it off.

386
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:26,510
不
{\ren}No!

387
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:28,680
我会写信给她
{\ren}I'll write her. I promise.

388
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:35,900
我的水壶还有水 拿去吧
{\ren}Take my canteen. There's still some water in there.

389
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:42,780
也许这样最好
{\ren}It's for the best.

390
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,950
我的下面被炸烂
{\ren}I'm all messed up down there.

391
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,210
不能搞了
{\ren}I can't fuck no more.

392
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:54,960
我在哪儿?
{\ren}Whoa... Where am I?

393
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:58,090
我在哪儿?
{\ren}Where am I?

394
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:03,220
你不会有事
{\ren}You're gonna be all right.

395
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:07,430
就算你死了 你没有对不起兄弟
{\ren}Even if you die, you didn't let your brother down.

396
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:12,230
要是你不扑上去 我们全都会死
{\ren}If you hadn't thrown yourself against that embankment, we'd all have been killed.

397
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:14,400
我好冷
{\ren}I'm cold.

398
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:18,990
我好冷
{\ren}I'm cold.

399
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,320
我快冻死了
{\ren}I'm... freezing.

400
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:19,500
你要写信给他老婆?
{\ren}You gonna write his wife?

401
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:22,790
才不要
{\ren}Fuck, no.

402
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:25,290
我又不认识她
{\ren}I don't know his old lady.

403
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:30,420
那是连长的事 别傻了 我不会写信
{\ren}That's the company commander's job. You outta your mind? I ain't no good at writing.

404
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:32,590
你答应过他
{\ren}You told him you would.

405
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:36,470
他快死了 我得那么说
{\ren}I'll say anything to 'em when they're like that.

406
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:39,180
有人得写信给她
{\ren}Somebody ought to do it.

407
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:42,140
你写给她吧
{\ren}Well, then, you write her. Yeah, you write her.

408
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,700
怎么回事?
{\ren}What's wrong, Jim?

409
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:18,780
他没救了 谁也救不了他
{\ren}There's nothing anybody can do for him. He'll die before they get him to a surgeon.

410
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:23,870
- 你不必去了 - 我可以替他注射吗啡
{\ren}- Then I can't ask you to go out there. - Maybe I could get some morphine into him.

411
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:27,210
- 能让他安静吗? - 不能 我可以打两针
{\ren}- Would it keep him quiet? - Not for long, but I can give him two.

412
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:30,710
留三 四针给他自己打
{\ren}And I could maybe leave him three or four for himself.

413
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,090
你能一次打完吗?
{\ren}Couldn't you give 'em to him all at once?

414
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:55,650
你们都会死
{\ren}That's what you are.

415
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:00,490
我们全都会没命
{\ren}That's all there is for us. That's us, that's us.

416
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:04,330
我的十二名弟兄都死了
{\ren}I lost all twelve. I lost all twelve.

417
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:07,500
全都挂了
{\ren}All twelve of 'em.

418
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:09,040
太疯狂了
{\ren}It's insanity up there.

419
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:13,210
我叫他们勇往直前
{\ren}I told 'em what to do, I showed 'em where to go and I gave 'em a push.

420
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:18,630
- 救命 - 我认得你...副连长
{\ren}- Somebody help! - I know you. I know you, Sergeant.

421
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:23,430
这里谁指挥? 别放走他
{\ren}It's insane. I don't know who's in charge here, but don't let him go! Don't let him go!

422
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:25,560
我要走 我要走
{\ren}I'm outta here. I'm outta here.

423
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:29,770
两只脚 快走 走啊
{\ren}I'm outta here. All right, move feet. Move, move, move, move. Move, move!

424
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:32,610
我要走了 我要走了...
{\ren}I'm moving. I'm moving. I'm moving now.

425
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:37,360
别碰我 别看我 别碰我 别看我 我走了
{\ren}Don't touch. Don't touch. Don't look at me. Don't touch. OK, I'm outta here.

426
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,450
没事了 没事了
{\ren}All right. All right.

427
01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:42,490
没事了 没事了
{\ren}All right. All right.

428
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:02,640
救救我
{\ren}Somebody help me!

429
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:03,970
救救我!
{\ren}Help me!

430
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:08,850
还好吧 小子? 我来救你了 提拉
{\ren}You gotta be quiet. I came to help you, Tella.

431
01:03:08,930 --> 01:03:11,350
- 安静点 - 去你的
{\ren}- OK. Calm down. - Fuck you!

432
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,520
我快死了 我快死了
{\ren}I'm dying! I'm dying, sarge!

433
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:17,030
那就安静地等死
{\ren}OK. Well, goddamn it, do it with less noise!

434
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:20,860
- 你能救我吗? - 我会带你回去
{\ren}- How you gonna get me out? - I'm gonna take you back.

435
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,950
- 来 - 不!
{\ren}- Come on. - No!

436
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:28,620
放我下来 放我下来
{\ren}Put me down! Put me down!

437
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,960
别管我 你别管我
{\ren}Leave me alone... Leave me alone.

438
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:39,420
你别管我
{\ren}Please, leave me alone.

439
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:49,930
给我多一点 给我多一点
{\ren}Give me more. Give me more.

440
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,810
再给我多一点...
{\ren}Give me more. Give me more.

441
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:55,060
再给我多一点...
{\ren}Give me more. Give me more.

442
01:03:58,190 --> 01:03:59,440
来吧
{\ren}Here, Tella.

443
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,830
再见...再见...
{\ren}Goodbye... goodbye.

444
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,790
再见了 小子
{\ren}Bye, kid.

445
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:18,880
再见 副连长
{\ren}Goodbye, sarge. Goodbye.

446
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:39,110
幸好部队不必只靠一个大兵
{\ren}Fortunately, Jim, the fate of the company doesn't depend on one man.

447
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:47,070
我用望远镜看到经过
{\ren}Sergeant, I saw the whole thing through the glasses.

448
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:51,410
我会请营长表扬你
{\ren}I'm gonna mention you in orders tomorrow and recommend you for the Silver Star.

449
01:04:51,490 --> 01:04:54,120
- 我要替你争取银星勋章 - 长官
{\ren}- It's the most courageous thing... - Captain,

450
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:58,420
你再说下去我就把你揍扁
{\ren}you say one more word to thank me, I'll knock you right in the teeth.

451
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:02,210
你去争取勋章 我马上辞职
{\ren}You mention me in your fuckin' orders, and I'll resign so fast

452
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:06,340
让你一个人指挥这个烂部队
{\ren}and leave you here to run this busted-up outfit by yourself.

453
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:09,680
懂不懂?
{\ren}You understand?

454
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:14,140
权力! 打仗全是为了权力
{\ren}Property! Whole fuckin' thing's about property.

455
01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:33,370
你在搞什么鬼? 马上派人支援他们
{\ren}What's the matter with you, Staros? Those men should be reinforced immediately!

456
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:36,290
他们在干嘛?
{\ren}What are they doing? I can see 'em through my glasses.

457
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:38,460
躲在那里做什么?
{\ren}They're lying behind that ledge!

458
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:42,090
他们应该去消灭机关枪
{\ren}They should be up and out, cleaning out those machine guns! Over!

459
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:45,090
我想你不明白 长官
{\ren}I don't think you understand what's going on, sir.

460
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:48,050
我们的伤亡惨重
{\ren}We've had... heavy casualties.

461
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:53,010
有一个人的肠子被打出来 死得很惨
{\ren}We had a man... His gut got shot out on the slopes, sir. Created quite an upset.

462
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:56,270
好吧 到底有没有支援?
{\ren}Fine, fine. Now, what about those reinforcements? Over.

463
01:05:56,350 --> 01:06:02,190
第一排有两个班可以支援
{\ren}I have two squads to First Platoon I can send up, sir. Over.

464
01:06:02,270 --> 01:06:04,690
什么 两个班?!
{\ren}What the hell do you mean, two squads?!

465
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:08,240
该死 我叫你支援就照办
{\ren}Goddamn you, Staros! When I say reinforcements,

466
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:13,080
马上派全体兄弟攻上去
{\ren}goddamn it, I mean it! You commit everybody you have there and do it now!

467
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:17,160
第一排也得去 我看到他们躺着不动
{\ren}Your First Platoon, too. I see 'em lying on their fat asses doing nothing.

468
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:22,290
派人上去 命令他们进攻 命令他们侧攻
{\ren}Get a man to 'em right now with orders to attack, and move 'em by the flank to the ridge.

469
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:25,170
然后叫第二排攻上山头
{\ren}Then get that Second Platoon over to the hill!

470
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:28,510
叫他们直接攻上去
{\ren}Have 'em press the centre. Go straight up that goddamn hill!

471
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:30,260
马上进攻
{\ren}Attack them right now!

472
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:34,140
天啊 要我教吗?
{\ren}Jesus, Staros! Do i have to give you a lesson on infantry tactics

473
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:36,850
你的兄弟快被射死了
{\ren}while your men are getting their asses shot off?.

474
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:40,690
上校 你不明白这里的情况
{\ren}Colonel, I don't think you fully understand what is going on here.

475
01:06:40,770 --> 01:06:43,980
光凭这一队不能攻下山头
{\ren}My company alone cannot take that position, sir.

476
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:47,570
敌军防守严密 火力太强
{\ren}The Japs are too well dug in. They've got too much fire power.

477
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:49,740
上面有座碉堡
{\ren}Colonel, there's a bunker up there.

478
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:53,200
我们看不到 它把我的兄弟打得很惨
{\ren}We can't see it, and it's... it's chewing my men to pieces, sir.

479
01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:59,960
请你准许我先派人
{\ren}I request permission for patrol reconnaissance around

480
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:03,670
进入右边的森林搜查
{\ren}to the right of Hill 210. I believe the entire position, sir,

481
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:06,380
从右边包抄应该能攻下山头
{\ren}can be outflanked with a manoeuvre there in force.

482
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:08,760
- 不行 该死 - 挽救生命
{\ren}- No! Goddamn it, no! - Might save lives!

483
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:10,720
不能包抄
{\ren}There'll be no flanking move.

484
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:13,640
听我说 你不能带兄弟
{\ren}Listen, Staros. You're not gonna take your men

485
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:17,180
躲到丛林当缩头乌龟
{\ren}around into the jungle to avoid a goddamn fight!

486
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:22,810
我要你带领兄弟全力进攻
{\ren}Do you hear me, Staros? I want you to attack right now with every man at your disposal!

487
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:25,770
史塔奥 快进攻 这是命令
{\ren}Now, attack, Staros! That's a direct order!

488
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:38,120
我必须违背你的命令
{\ren}Sir, I must tell you that I refuse to obey your order.

489
01:07:52,590 --> 01:07:56,550
- 在那里 能看见吗? - 看不见
{\ren}- There it is, right there. See it? - I don't see it.

490
01:07:57,310 --> 01:08:00,100
你没有错 他下了命令
{\ren}This is not your fault, Jim. He's ordering you to.

491
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:09,110
我请你让我派人到丛林搜查
{\ren}I again request permission for patrol reconnaissance around to the right in force.

492
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:14,070
现在时间是...13时21分25秒
{\ren}The time, sir,... is 1321 hours, 25 seconds.

493
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:19,160
两名证人听到我的话 请你也找证人
{\ren}I have two witnesses here. I request that you do the same with witnesses there. Over.

494
01:08:24,330 --> 01:08:27,880
别给我来律师那一套
{\ren}Staros, don't pull this guardhouse-lawyer bullshit with me!

495
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:32,090
你是律师 这里却不是法庭
{\ren}Now, I know you're a goddamn lawyer! This is not a court of law.

496
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:34,430
这是战场 我们在打仗
{\ren}This is a war. It's a goddamn battle!

497
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:39,390
我重覆 我要你正面攻击
{\ren}Now, I want that frontal attack. I repeat my order. Over.

498
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:43,140
我拒绝率领兄弟作正面攻击
{\ren}Colonel, I refuse to take my men up there in a frontal attack.

499
01:08:43,230 --> 01:08:45,400
这等于是自杀
{\ren}It's suicide, sir.

500
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:50,650
我和他们生活两年半 不能命令他们送死 完毕
{\ren}I've lived with these men for two years, and I will not order them all to their deaths. Over.

501
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:02,250
这是很重大的决定
{\ren}This is a very important decision, Staros.

502
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:09,670
也许你有理由这么做
{\ren}But if you feel that strongly, maybe you have a reason, so I'm coming down.

503
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:12,130
我要过去
{\ren}Go take a look.

504
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:14,920
我不是取消命令
{\ren}I'm not rescinding my order to you, son,

505
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:19,850
不过如果是特殊状况 我会仔细考虑
{\ren}but if I find extenuating circumstances when I get there, I'll take that into account.

506
01:09:19,930 --> 01:09:24,230
你们守在那儿等我来
{\ren}Now, in the meantime, goddamn it, I want you to hold on until I get there.

507
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:28,520
可能的话叫那些兄弟前进 完毕
{\ren}And, if possible, you get those men on the ridge out and moving! Out.

508
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,140
(希腊语)

509
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:44,370
哪里都一样
{\ren}One spot's as good as another, men.

510
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:46,540
根本就无处可躲
{\ren}There's no place to hide.

511
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:55,550
孩子 放松点
{\ren}Just take it easy, son. Take it easy. Take it easy.

512
01:09:56,550 --> 01:09:59,010
费夫呢?
{\ren}Where's... where's Fife?

513
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:01,300
在这儿 费夫
{\ren}Fife? He's right here, son. Fife.

514
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:04,020
握住我的手
{\ren}Hold my hand, Fife.

515
01:10:04,930 --> 01:10:07,020
握我的手
{\ren}Hold my hand.

516
01:10:12,190 --> 01:10:14,190
抓住了
{\ren}I got it.

517
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,280
我快死了
{\ren}I'm dying, Fife.

518
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:49,480
连长...
{\ren}Oh, Captain...

519
01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:40,860
我被埋在棺材里
{\ren}Shut up in a tomb.

520
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:45,120
掀不起棺盖
{\ren}Can't lift the lid.

521
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:49,660
我的处境进退两难
{\ren}Played a role I never conceived.

522
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:53,960
穿上衣服 这不是海滩
{\ren}Get that blouse on, soldier. It's not a goddamn bathing beach!

523
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:55,710
立刻穿上
{\ren}Put it on right now.

524
01:11:55,790 --> 01:11:59,170
你在指谁? 去杀敌呀
{\ren}What you aiming at, son? Let's go get those son of a bitches.

525
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:01,340
前进!
{\ren}Move up!

526
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:14,850
你趴在这儿什么也看不到
{\ren}What are you doing laying down there where you can't see a damn thing?

527
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:23,740
我正在观察 我派第一排上去
{\ren}Observing, sir. Just sent First Platoon forward to the ridge.

528
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:27,450
- 这次有几个中弹? - 没有
{\ren}- How many of 'em were hit this time? - None, sir.

529
01:12:27,530 --> 01:12:29,620
一个都没有?
{\ren}None? Not one?

530
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:34,580
这跟你说的情况不一样
{\ren}Doesn't sound like the situation you described to me over the sound power.

531
01:12:34,670 --> 01:12:39,250
五分钟前情况改变了
{\ren}Well, it's not. The situation's changed just in the last five minutes, sir.

532
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,880
上尉 给我听住
{\ren}Captain, you listen to me.

533
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:47,600
我们要全力向前进攻
{\ren}We're going over there and taking everybody with us.

534
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:50,180
有问题吗?
{\ren}Do you have any more complaints or demurrers?

535
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,940
- 现在 没有 - 好吧 你得照我的方法
{\ren}- No, sir. Not now. - All right! We're gonna do things my way!

536
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:57,440
让我来指挥
{\ren}My way! You understand that, Captain?

537
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:01,820
大家上去 晚上得攻下来
{\ren}We're taking everybody over to that ledge! We may take that ridge by nightfall!

538
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:05,780
上面的火力还是很强
{\ren}I think the ridge is quite a way from being reduced, sir.

539
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:15,460
神啊 你到底看到什么?
{\ren}Show me how to see things the way you do.

540
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:21,000
让我知道你看到什么
{\ren}Show me how to see things the way you do.

541
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:27,470
我们全是尘土
{\ren}We're just dirt. We're just dirt.

542
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:53,580
留在这儿肯定送命
{\ren}We're gonna get killed if we stay here.

543
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:56,910
比尔 带六个弟兄
{\ren}Bell, take six men

544
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,080
上去探查
{\ren}and go see what's up there.

545
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:07,510
我们会掩护你们
{\ren}And we'll cover you the best we can from down there.

546
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:28,710
好
{\ren}OK.

547
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,300
你们留下来
{\ren}You guys, you guys, stay here. OK?

548
01:15:32,430 --> 01:15:34,510
我一个人去
{\ren}I'm going alone.

549
01:17:14,110 --> 01:17:16,200
来吧
{\ren}Come out.

550
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:23,620
到我的身边
{\ren}Come out where lam.

551
01:18:32,110 --> 01:18:34,860
上面有...上面有...
{\ren}There was a... There was a...

552
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:38,860
上面有一座碉堡
{\ren}There's a bunker... up there.

553
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:42,780
总共有五支机关枪
{\ren}It's five guns.

554
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,410
五支机关枪
{\ren}It's five guns.

555
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:54,710
攻下那些乱石间的碉堡
{\ren}That strongpoint up there, somewhere up there around those rocks,

556
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,880
就能攻下这座山头
{\ren}is the key to this ridge.

557
01:18:59,970 --> 01:19:02,090
比尔说得没错
{\ren}Bell here is quite right.

558
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:07,890
日本鬼子从上面
{\ren}From their knob up there, those little brown brothers can cover the whole of the ground

559
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:12,310
可以扫射一千码内的目标 不过他们漏掉这地方
{\ren}in front of this position for 1,000 yards. They've left this ledge unguarded.

560
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:16,360
这是很严重的错误 这是很严重的错误
{\ren}Now, goddamn it, that's a mistake. That's a hell of a mistake.

561
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:20,610
我们得利用他们的疏忽
{\ren}We need to take advantage of it before they see their error.

562
01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:26,490
我知道你们筋疲力尽
{\ren}All right, all right, I know you're all pretty exhausted,

563
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:30,040
这里连清水也没有
{\ren}and we've had a hell of a time getting water up here.

564
01:19:30,910 --> 01:19:33,830
对不起 我向大家道歉
{\ren}For that I'm sorry. I apologise to you all.

565
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:39,630
不过明天若能攻下这座碉堡 就能占领山头
{\ren}But if we can reduce this bunker tomorrow, I think we can take this ridge.

566
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:44,800
有没有人自愿
{\ren}So I'm asking for volunteers.

567
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:47,140
回去攻下那座碉堡
{\ren}Go back up there and knock it out.

568
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:49,310
长官
{\ren}Sir?

569
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:51,480
我愿意...
{\ren}I'll be glad to go back up

570
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:53,900
- 身先士卒回去作战 - 很好 比尔
{\ren}- and lead the way back for a party. - Right.

571
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:55,690
- 上校 我也去 - 还有你
{\ren}- I'll go, sir. - You.

572
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:57,900
好的
{\ren}All right.

573
01:19:57,980 --> 01:20:02,820
- 我很想率领突击队 - 我正希望你去 约翰
{\ren}- I'd like to lead the party, Colonel. - All right, John. I was hoping you'd say that.

574
01:20:02,910 --> 01:20:05,820
- 你来指挥 - 我要去
{\ren}- You'll be in command. - I'll go, sir.

575
01:20:05,910 --> 01:20:07,280
- 长官 - 你
{\ren}- Sir? - You.

576
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:11,370
够了 七个人够多了 准备出发
{\ren}All right, men, that's enough. Seven is plenty. Gather up.

577
01:20:15,170 --> 01:20:19,670
史塔奥 你知道这一役有多重要吗?
{\ren}I don't know if you realise the importance of this operation, Staros.

578
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:24,260
攻下这座岛 轰炸机就能降落
{\ren}Once our position is secured, we can move the bombers in.

579
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:28,310
我们的军队 便有一千英里的空中攻击力
{\ren}That means air power for 1,000 miles in every direction.

580
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:32,850
窝达康拉尔岛一役能决定胜负
{\ren}Guadalcanal may be the turning point in the war.

581
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:37,560
- 你不同意 一定得牺牲性命? - 不是 长官
{\ren}- It'll cost lives. Is that what's troubling you? - No, sir.

582
01:20:40,690 --> 01:20:43,700
我跟你说过胜利的重要
{\ren}I explained to you the importance of this objective.

583
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:46,990
你认为牺牲多少兄弟才值得?
{\ren}How many men do you think it's worth? How many lives?

584
01:20:47,070 --> 01:20:49,160
我不知道
{\ren}I can't say, sir.

585
01:20:55,060 --> 01:21:00,300
你愿意牺牲你的兄弟吗?
{\ren}Are you prepared to sacrifice the lives of any of your men in this campaign?

586
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:04,880
多少? 一个? 两个?
{\ren}How many? One? Two?

587
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,530
二十个?
{\ren}Twenty?

588
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:12,070
你的小队一定会死人
{\ren}Lives will be lost in your company, Captain.

589
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:17,830
要是你受不了 现在最好让我知道
{\ren}And if you don't have the stomach for it, now is the time to let me know.

590
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:22,620
不 你说得对 你说得都对
{\ren}No, sir. You're right... about everything you said.

591
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:24,790
好吧 没事了
{\ren}Fine, fine.

592
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,960
好吧 长官
{\ren}That's all, Captain.

593
01:21:28,670 --> 01:21:30,760
还有一件事
{\ren}One more thing, Staros.

594
01:21:31,510 --> 01:21:35,800
你不必跟我说我说得对
{\ren}It's not necessary for you to ever tell me that you think I'm right.

595
01:21:36,390 --> 01:21:38,060
没有必要
{\ren}Ever.

596
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:40,480
这是理所当然的
{\ren}We'll assume it.

597
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,440
解散
{\ren}Dismissed.

598
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:01,330
我为你感到遗憾
{\ren}I feel sorry for you, kid.

599
01:22:02,710 --> 01:22:04,790
- 是吗? - 有一点吧
{\ren}- Yeah? - Yeah, a little.

600
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:10,340
这场仗会害死你
{\ren}This army's gonna kill you.

601
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:19,810
你还是保佑自己好运点 别想救别人了
{\ren}If you were smart, you'd take care of yourself. There's nothing you can do for anybody else.

602
01:22:19,890 --> 01:22:24,060
就算你拼命也救不了什么人
{\ren}You're just running into a burning house where nobody can be saved.

603
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:41,750
在乱世中一个人的力量很渺小
{\ren}What difference do you think you can make? One single man in all this madness.

604
01:22:47,290 --> 01:22:49,710
不要白白送死
{\ren}If you die, it's gonna be for nothing.

605
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:58,510
没有另一个美好世界
{\ren}There's not some other world out there where everything's gonna be OK.

606
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,680
这是唯一的世界
{\ren}There's just this one.

607
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:04,680
只有这座孤岛
{\ren}Just this rock.

608
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:44,140
来吧 让我死吧
{\ren}Go ahead! Come on, come on.

609
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:47,350
谁能决定别人的生?
{\ren}Who's deciding who's gonna live?

610
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:50,150
谁能决定别人的死?
{\ren}Who's deciding who's gonna die?

611
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:54,110
太荒谬了
{\ren}This is futile!

612
01:23:55,570 --> 01:24:00,660
看看我 我身上没有中弹
{\ren}Look at me! I stand right up here and not one bullet.

613
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:02,830
毫发未伤!
{\ren}Not one shot!

614
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:05,620
为什么?
{\ren}Why?

615
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:08,000
他们全都死了
{\ren}How come they all had to die?

616
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:12,540
我却站在这儿 一点事也没有
{\ren}I can stand right here, I can stand right up and nothing happens to me!

617
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:35,150
我们
{\ren}We.

618
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:43,780
我们在一起
{\ren}We together.

619
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:56,590
合而为一
{\ren}One being.

620
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:13,900
水乳交融
{\ren}Flow together like water,

621
01:25:17,190 --> 01:25:19,490
分不出你和我
{\ren}till I can't tell you from me.

622
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:39,460
我爱你
{\ren}I drink you.

623
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:43,590
现在
{\ren}Now.

624
01:25:45,930 --> 01:25:48,010
现在
{\ren}Now.

625
01:26:24,630 --> 01:26:26,720
您是我的明灯
{\ren}You're my light.

626
01:26:29,970 --> 01:26:32,060
我的指引
{\ren}My guide.

627
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:44,590
我们在后面 要是攻破防线
{\ren}John, I'll be behind you. If you wanna break through, we'll come after.

628
01:27:44,670 --> 01:27:47,220
就吹哨子通知我们冲上去
{\ren}We'll charge at your whistle signal.

629
01:27:47,970 --> 01:27:50,470
去吧 去杀敌吧
{\ren}All right, let's go, men. Go get 'em.

630
01:29:44,790 --> 01:29:46,880
好
{\ren}OK.

631
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:50,550
你们留在底下
{\ren}Stay down, below this ledge,

632
01:29:50,630 --> 01:29:54,640
我从上面叫出敌人方位
{\ren}and I'll call down the data from above.

633
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:59,310
让炮兵密集轰炸这些岩石
{\ren}Once the 81s have plastered that rock... as much as possible,

634
01:29:59,390 --> 01:30:03,190
再到大石旁找掩护
{\ren}we're gonna crawl out along that big rock for cover

635
01:30:04,690 --> 01:30:06,770
然后从右翼进攻
{\ren}and then flank 'em to the right.

636
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:08,730
好吗?
{\ren}OK?

637
01:30:10,230 --> 01:30:12,820
好...好
{\ren}OK. OK.

638
01:30:33,510 --> 01:30:38,100

{\ren}We've wasted enough time here. Let's go.

684
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:23,930

{\ren}Sir, I've a few recommendations for decorations.

{\ren}Yes. We'll get everything for all of 'em that we can, but later.

{\ren}Meantime, I want you to know I'm personally recommending you for something, John.

01:40:32,190 --> 01:40:33,650
也许是英勇奖章

-  谢谢你 不过我... - 这是你应得的
{\ren}- Thank you, sir, but I don't feel... - Yes, you do, John.

689
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:39,740
能不能争取到才是问题
{\ren}Getting it for you will be the goddamn problem!

690
01:40:39,820 --> 01:40:44,240
你能受勋对部队有很大鼓舞
{\ren}But, hell, it'd be a big thing for the battalion and the regiment, if you did get it.

691
01:40:44,330 --> 01:40:45,990
最好赶快前进
{\ren}We better move out.

692
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:50,620
加入别的部队攻上山头
{\ren}We need to extend our lines, hook up with the other companies and push on to the top.

693
01:40:50,710 --> 01:40:53,670
你想指挥B队吗?
{\ren}Would you like to take command of Baker Company?

694
01:40:53,750 --> 01:40:54,800
当然想
{\ren}Of course.

695
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:59,510
我不想扫你的兴 但是没有食水...
{\ren}Sir, I don't mean to be a wet blanket, but about the water. If we don't get water...

696
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:01,680
别担心水的问题
{\ren}Don't worry about water.

697
01:41:03,180 --> 01:41:08,430
现在士气如虹 不能中断
{\ren}John, I don't want anything to break up this attack of ours now we have the momentum.

698
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:12,060
过几个小时就有食用水
{\ren}We'll have some water in a... couple of hours.

699
01:41:12,150 --> 01:41:14,230
我会安排的
{\ren}I've arranged for that.

700
01:41:14,860 --> 01:41:18,360
该死 现在不能停下来
{\ren}Now, we just can't stop now, goddamn it, and wait for it.

701
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:20,320
是的 长官
{\ren}No, sir.

702
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,610
没错
{\ren}That's right.

703
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:28,500
如果有些人因脱水昏倒 那就让他们昏倒
{\ren}And if some of the men... pass out, why, hell, they'll just have to pass out.

704
01:41:32,290 --> 01:41:34,170
好吧
{\ren}All right.

705
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:35,710
他们会死的
{\ren}They could...

706
01:41:35,790 --> 01:41:39,130
他们也会被敌人杀死
{\ren}They could die from it.They could die from enemy fire, too!

707
01:41:40,470 --> 01:41:42,760
他们很坚强
{\ren}They're all tough boys.

708
01:41:47,510 --> 01:41:52,640
兄弟们 走吧 一路上会有更多死人
{\ren}Come on, men, let's go! You'll see plenty more of those where we're going!

709
01:41:52,730 --> 01:41:55,310
到底要不要上山头?
{\ren}Are we going up this hill or aren't we?

710
01:41:59,190 --> 01:42:03,160
我相信现在能突破日军防线
{\ren}John, I'm convinced that the Japanese position can be broken now.

711
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:08,330
只要继续前进 日落时就能攻下山头
{\ren}All we have to do is keep going and we'll have this hill. We'll have this hill by sundown.

712
01:42:08,410 --> 01:42:11,410
看到他们全新的斗志吗?
{\ren}You see the spirit in these men? D'you see the new spirit?

713
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:16,670
我们得一鼓作气 乘胜追击
{\ren}Well, I want to take advantage of that before something happens to sap their strength.

714
01:42:16,750 --> 01:42:19,630
要是稍微迟疑就会战败
{\ren}To have this battalion relieved in a defeat,

715
01:42:19,710 --> 01:42:23,170
或者是根本
{\ren}or even to have it reinforced from troops

716
01:42:23,170 --> 01:42:26,640
攻不上山头
{\ren} from the reserves,if we were to stall before reaching the top, well,

717
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:30,970
天啊 我不能忍受失败
{\ren}Jesus Christ, that's just a hell of a lot more than I could stand!

718
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:33,440
我等了一辈子
{\ren}I've waited all my life for this.

719
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:38,070
一直以来忍气吞声 都是为了这一刻
{\ren}I've worked, slaved, eaten... oh, untold buckets of shit to have this opportunity!

720
01:42:38,150 --> 01:42:40,610
我不会半途而废
{\ren}And I don't intend to give it up now.

721
01:42:43,780 --> 01:42:47,450
你不知道被忽略的感受
{\ren}You don't know what it feels like to be passed over.

722
01:42:47,530 --> 01:42:50,700
你刚出军校 还很年轻
{\ren}I mean, you're young. You're just out of the Academy.

723
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:56,460
你生对时代了 我等了十五年才等到这场战争
{\ren}You're, you know, you've got your war! This 15 years, this is my first war!

724
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:05,260
有一天你会了解
{\ren}John, some day you'll understand.

725
01:43:11,140 --> 01:43:13,230
我把你当儿子看待
{\ren}You're like a son to me, John.

726
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,690
知道我儿子做什么吗?
{\ren}You know what my son does?

727
01:43:18,610 --> 01:43:20,690
他做鱼饵生意
{\ren}He's a bait salesman.

728
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,360
你干得很好
{\ren}You've done a hell of a job, John.

729
01:43:25,450 --> 01:43:30,330
我要让你得到应得的荣誉
{\ren}I'm gonna make sure that you get everything, everything that you deserve.

730
01:43:32,580 --> 01:43:34,660
谢谢你 长官
{\ren}Thank you, sir.

731
01:43:36,750 --> 01:43:38,830
天啊...
{\ren}God...

732
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:42,380
该死 我要三名传令兵
{\ren}Goddamn it! I want three runners!

733
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:44,130
给我三名传令兵
{\ren}Get me three runners!

734
01:43:44,210 --> 01:43:46,470
回去找水源
{\ren}You go back to the rear to find water

735
01:43:46,550 --> 01:43:49,430
马上运过来
{\ren}and get back here with it as fast as you can!

736
01:43:50,350 --> 01:43:53,560
一小时后就全力进攻
{\ren}We attack in one hour! We'll throw everything we got at 'em.

737
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:56,140
不能失败 没人能阻止
{\ren}We're going all the way! Nothing'll stop us.

738
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:58,310
晚上就得成功
{\ren}It's high ground by nightfall!

739
01:44:22,460 --> 01:44:25,010

{\ren}They're no different than dead dogs,

742
01:44:31,180 --> 01:44:33,260
只要有这种想法

他们就像猪肉一样

744
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:59,210
你们代表正义和善良吗?
{\ren}Are you righteous? Kind?

745
01:45:02,290 --> 01:45:04,460
你们是否有信心?
{\ren}Does your confidence lie in this?

746
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:09,970
受到大家爱护?
{\ren}Are you loved by all?

747
01:45:12,260 --> 01:45:14,350
我跟你们一样
{\ren}Know that I was, too.

748
01:45:17,930 --> 01:45:22,600
你们认为自己所受的苦难 是比较少吗?
{\ren}Do you imagine your sufferings will be less because you loved goodness?

749
01:45:23,230 --> 01:45:25,320
我们善良有良知

01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:50,480
它来自哪里?
{\ren}Where's it come from?

756
01:50:55,150 --> 01:50:57,240
怎么会潜伏在世上?
{\ren}How'd it steal into the world?

757
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:12,550
原因和根源到底是什么?
{\ren}What seed, what root did it grow from?

758
01:51:17,470 --> 01:51:19,550
这是谁造成的?
{\ren}Who's doing this?

759
01:51:22,140 --> 01:51:24,220
谁在屠杀众生

760
01:51:28,190 --> 01:51:30,690
剥夺我们的生命之火

01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:38,860
嘲笑我们对人间的依恋
{\ren}Mocking us with the sight of what we might have known.

762
01:52:04,850 --> 01:52:07,560
战争对地球有利吗?
{\ren}Does our ruin benefit the Earth?

763
01:52:09,940 --> 01:52:13,570
它能滋长万物 孕育众生吗?
{\ren}Does it help the grass to grow or the sun to shine?

764
01:52:19,740 --> 01:52:22,030
上帝也有黑暗的一面?
{\ren}Is this darkness in you, too?

765
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:30,830
他是否也感受邪恶力量?
{\ren}Have you passed through this night?

766
01:52:37,050 --> 01:52:39,590
我要把你开膛剖肚

767
01:52:43,300 --> 01:52:45,390
你死定了
{\ren}You're dying.

768
01:52:57,320 --> 01:52:59,440
看到那些鸟吗?
{\ren}See them birds up there?

769
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:03,490
它们会把你生吞活剥
{\ren}You know they eat you raw?

770
01:53:08,410 --> 01:53:11,580
你下地狱就回不来
{\ren}Where you're going, you're not coming back from.

771
01:53:18,070 --> 01:53:21,040
(日语)

772
01:54:23,070 --> 01:54:25,160
你对我有意义吗?
{\ren}What are you to me?

773
01:54:30,950 --> 01:54:33,040
毫无义意
{\ren}Nothing.

774
01:56:54,260 --> 01:56:56,350
坐下来
{\ren}Have a seat here.

775
01:57:06,610 --> 01:57:09,400
史塔奥 我要将你革职
{\ren}Staros, I'm relieving you of your command.

776
01:57:12,780 --> 01:57:15,160
班中尉会取代你
{\ren}Lieutenant Band will take over for you.

777
01:57:16,870 --> 01:57:18,950
我跟他说了
{\ren}I already told him.

778
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:31,630
我也不想这么做
{\ren}It's a hard thing to do.

779
01:57:32,430 --> 01:57:34,510
这是很困难的决定
{\ren}Difficult decision to make.

780
01:57:37,640 --> 01:57:39,810
你的心不够狠
{\ren}I don't think you're tough enough.

781
01:57:41,310 --> 01:57:46,310
你心太软了 不够心狠手辣
{\ren}You're too soft. You're just too soft-hearted. You're not tough-fibred enough.

782
01:57:50,860 --> 01:57:54,820
我的心意已定 没什么好说
{\ren}Anyway, it's my decision to make. I've already made it.

783
01:57:55,530 --> 01:57:58,030
我不想让我的兄弟送死
{\ren}I don't like to see my men get killed, sir.

784
01:58:06,290 --> 01:58:09,500
有人曾死在你怀里吗?
{\ren}Have you ever had anyone die in your arms, sir?

785
01:58:09,590 --> 01:58:11,880
有吗?
{\ren}Have you?

786
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:27,480
我不想引起事端
{\ren}I don't see any reason to make a scandal out of this.

787
01:58:27,560 --> 01:58:32,990
也不想在服役记录中留下污点
{\ren}I don't want it in the records of the battalion. There's no reason for you to have it on yours.

788
01:58:33,070 --> 01:58:36,660
这和能力或胆量无关
{\ren}This has nothing to do with cowardice or inefficiency.

789
01:58:39,950 --> 01:58:42,250
看看这座丛林
{\ren}Look at this jungle.

790
01:58:42,330 --> 01:58:47,670
那些藤蔓缠绕着大树 吞食一切
{\ren}Look at those vines, the way they twine around the trees, swallowing everything.

791
01:58:50,090 --> 01:58:52,380
大自然很残酷
{\ren}Nature's cruel, Staros.

792
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:07,190
你可以申请调到华府的军法局
{\ren}I'm going to let you apply for reassignment to the Judge Advocate General Corps

793
01:59:07,270 --> 01:59:09,150
就说你生了病
{\ren}for reasons of ill health.

794
01:59:09,230 --> 01:59:10,610
你是律师
{\ren}You're a lawyer.

795
01:59:10,690 --> 01:59:13,070
- 你得过虐疾吗? - 没有
{\ren}- You had malaria yet? - No, I haven't.

796
01:59:13,150 --> 01:59:15,530
无所谓 我会安排的
{\ren}Doesn't matter. I can fix that.

797
01:59:15,610 --> 01:59:17,860
反正你会染上的
{\ren}Anyway, you probably will have it.

798
01:59:18,530 --> 01:59:21,620
我也会推荐你获颁银星勋章
{\ren}I'm also recommending you for the Silver Star.

799
01:59:21,700 --> 01:59:25,870
我一定会让你无法推辞
{\ren}And I'll recommend it in such a way it definitely won't be refused.

800
01:59:26,790 --> 01:59:29,420
干脆也让你得紫心奖章
{\ren}Might as well have the Purple Heart, too.

801
01:59:32,090 --> 01:59:33,760
为什么?
{\ren}Why?

802
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:39,470
因为你脸上的疤 和手上的伤口
{\ren}Because of that scratch on your face and because of those cuts on your hands.

803
01:59:39,550 --> 01:59:41,220
给我听好
{\ren}Listen to me, Staros.

804
01:59:41,300 --> 01:59:45,350
你跟下一批伤兵离开
{\ren}I think it's best you go back with the next batch of wounded and prisoners.

805
01:59:45,430 --> 01:59:49,230
留下来对你没好处
{\ren}It is no goddamn good for you to keep hanging around.

806
01:59:49,310 --> 01:59:52,860
这件事不说出去最好
{\ren}The quieter we keep this, the better it'll be for all.

807
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:29,770
这是多尔上校的宣布
{\ren}This is from Colonel Tall.

808
02:00:31,270 --> 02:00:34,770
我们的胜利带来最高的荣耀
{\ren}"Our victory gives us the highest reasons for pride".

809
02:00:35,860 --> 02:00:39,400
这是窝达康拉尔岛役的转捩点
{\ren}"It will prove a milestone in the battle for Guadalcanal".

810
02:00:40,740 --> 02:00:45,740
明天师长会亲自来检阅前线
{\ren}"Tomorrow the division commander will arrive to make an inspection of the line".

811
02:00:45,830 --> 02:00:51,080
接防部队会来换班
{\ren}"After the inspection we're to be relieved by a battalion of the division's reserve regiment".

812
02:00:52,540 --> 02:00:56,800
我为全营兄弟 争取到一星期的假
{\ren}"I've secured for the battalion a week's rest off the line".

813
02:01:01,050 --> 02:01:02,510
就这样
{\ren}That's all.

814
02:02:57,960 --> 02:03:00,040
长夜漫漫
{\ren}Hours like months.

815
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:04,880
度日如年
{\ren}Days like years.

816
02:03:08,220 --> 02:03:10,300
我正值青春年华

817
02:03:14,270 --> 02:03:16,850
站在新世界的边缘
{\ren}Stood on the shores of the New World.

818
02:03:27,780 --> 02:03:30,740
我本来想去看你们
{\ren}I would've come by and paid you guys a visit,

819
02:03:30,830 --> 02:03:32,490
不过...
{\ren}but...

820
02:03:35,620 --> 02:03:38,250
我想一个人静一下
{\ren}I just felt like being alone, you know?

821
02:03:40,040 --> 02:03:42,130
是吗?
{\ren}Yeah?

822
02:03:52,310 --> 02:03:54,390
我们要谢谢你
{\ren}We wanted to thank you, sir.

823
02:03:58,440 --> 02:04:00,940
要求进行包抄行动
{\ren}For asking to make that flanking move.

824
02:04:03,020 --> 02:04:05,110
为我们着想
{\ren}For watching out for us.

825
02:04:07,150 --> 02:04:09,240
让我们团结一致
{\ren}Keeping us together.

826
02:04:14,410 --> 02:04:16,500
你不该被调走
{\ren}We're all sorry to see you go.

827
02:04:16,580 --> 02:04:18,750
这不公平
{\ren}We feel like you got a rotten deal.

828
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:24,170
我并不同意
{\ren}Well, I'm not sure that you're right.

829
02:04:26,920 --> 02:04:28,800
最难的是
{\ren}Tough part is...

830
02:04:30,720 --> 02:04:33,180
不知道这么做有没有用
{\ren}not knowing if you're doing any good.

831
02:04:35,060 --> 02:04:37,140
这才是最难的
{\ren}That's the hard part.

832
02:04:38,890 --> 02:04:41,520
不过无所谓 我不在乎

833
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:44,440
我很高兴能离开

835
02:04:47,740 --> 02:04:51,530
- 还是能提出申诉 - 为什么?
{\ren}- There's still time. We could file a complaint. - For what?

836
02:04:52,620 --> 02:04:54,870
有什么用?
{\ren}What good would that do?

837
02:04:56,580 --> 02:04:58,250
反正我想走
{\ren}Anyway, I wanna go.

838
02:05:01,170 --> 02:05:03,630
别管它 算了吧
{\ren}Leave it alone. Let it lay.

839
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:11,850
(希腊语)

840
02:05:16,220 --> 02:05:18,310
什么意思?
{\ren}What does that mean, sir?

841
02:05:21,020 --> 02:05:23,350
你们像是我的孩子
{\ren}It means "You've been like my sons".

842
02:05:34,620 --> 02:05:36,700
你们是我的孩子
{\ren}You are my sons.

843
02:05:37,950 --> 02:05:40,040
我亲爱的孩子
{\ren}My dear sons.

844
02:05:43,960 --> 02:05:46,040
你们活在我心中
{\ren}You live inside me now.

845
02:05:50,050 --> 02:05:52,130
永远与我同在
{\ren}I'll carry you wherever I go.

846
02:06:08,150 --> 02:06:10,940
我忘不了战争的可怕
{\ren}Can't nothing make you forget it.

847
02:06:14,660 --> 02:06:17,160
悲剧不断重演
{\ren}Each time you start from scratch.

848
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:25,580
战争不能给我们荣耀
{\ren}War don't ennoble men.

849
02:06:26,630 --> 02:06:28,920
只会把人变成野狗

850
02:06:34,720 --> 02:06:36,800
荼毒我们的心灵

851
02:07:40,780 --> 02:07:42,870
亲爱的妻子
{\ren}My dear wife,

852
02:07:45,620 --> 02:07:52,210
战争的丑陋和血腥暴力 会让人丧失良知
{\ren}you get something twisted out of your insides by all this blood, filth, and noise.

853
02:08:01,680 --> 02:08:04,310
我很想保持纯真
{\ren}I wanna stay changeless for you.

854
02:08:06,890 --> 02:08:09,900
我想以原来的我回到你身边
{\ren}I wanna come back to you the man I was before.

855
02:08:17,900 --> 02:08:20,610
我们该如何获得宁静?
{\ren}How do we get to those other shores?

856
02:08:24,450 --> 02:08:26,540
回到青山绿水间?

真爱
{\ren}Love.

858
02:08:47,980 --> 02:08:50,060
到底来自何方?
{\ren}Where does it come from?

859
02:08:58,530 --> 02:09:00,610
谁燃起我们心中的爱火?
{\ren}Who lit this flame in us?

860
02:09:07,660 --> 02:09:09,750
战争无法熄灭它
{\ren}No war can put it out,

861
02:09:11,250 --> 02:09:13,330
或是征服它

862
02:09:21,180 --> 02:09:23,260
我曾是个囚犯
{\ren}I was a prisoner.

863
02:09:27,720 --> 02:09:29,810
你让我自由
{\ren}You set me free.

864
02:09:33,940 --> 02:09:36,480
不管你受过多少训练
{\ren}No matter how much training you got,

865
02:09:37,610 --> 02:09:39,690
或是多么小心
{\ren}how careful you are,

866
02:09:41,070 --> 02:09:44,530
只要运气不好就会阵亡
{\ren}it's a matter of luck whether or not you get killed.

867
02:09:44,620 --> 02:09:49,870
不管你是谁 或是多么骁勇善战
{\ren}Makes no difference who you are, or how tough a guy you might be,

868
02:09:51,910 --> 02:09:56,340
一不小心就会被杀死
{\ren}if you're in the wrong spot at the wrong time, you're gonna get it.

869
02:10:07,050 --> 02:10:09,520
我看着那个人死去
{\ren}I look at that boy dying,

870
02:10:11,020 --> 02:10:13,100
一点感觉都没有
{\ren}I don't feel nothing.

871
02:10:16,360 --> 02:10:19,020
我对一切都不在乎
{\ren}I don't care about nothing any more.

872
02:10:23,700 --> 02:10:25,780
听起来很幸福
{\ren}Sounds like bliss.

873
02:10:30,240 --> 02:10:32,330
我还没有那种感觉
{\ren}I don't have that feeling yet.

874
02:10:33,750 --> 02:10:35,830
麻木不仁的感觉
{\ren}That numbness.

875
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:38,960
我跟你们不一样
{\ren}Not like the rest of you guys.

876
02:10:43,300 --> 02:10:45,590
也许是因为我看得太多
{\ren}Maybe cos I knew what to expect.

877
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:51,060
根本就失去感觉
{\ren}Maybe I was just frozen up already.

878
02:11:34,850 --> 02:11:38,350
我入伍后就没碰过女人
{\ren}I haven't touched another woman since I was called up.

879
02:11:39,440 --> 02:11:41,520
或跟女人说过话

880
02:11:45,530 --> 02:11:47,610
我不想...
{\ren}I don't wanna...

881
02:11:48,320 --> 02:11:50,870
我不想有欲念
{\ren}I don't wanna feel the desire.

882
02:12:27,990 --> 02:12:29,660

{\ren}I want a divorce to marry him.

892
02:13:06,320 --> 02:13:09,900
你可以拒绝 但我还是要说

893
02:13:09,990 --> 02:13:12,780
毕竟我们曾夫妻一场

不过我忍不住
{\ren}I can't stop myself.

900
02:14:09,510 --> 02:14:11,590
习惯成自然
{\ren}A habit so strong.

901
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:16,390
你曾是我最好的朋友
{\ren}Oh, my friend of all those shining years.

902
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:22,600
帮助我离开你
{\ren}Help me leave you!

903
02:15:49,700 --> 02:15:51,780
你叫什么?
{\ren}What's your name?

904
02:17:03,810 --> 02:17:05,900
我们曾是一家人
{\ren}We were a family.

905
02:17:09,150 --> 02:17:11,740
不得已被拆散
{\ren}How'd it break up and come apart?

906
02:17:14,990 --> 02:17:18,490
现在我们自相残杀
{\ren}So that now we're turned against each other.

907
02:17:20,370 --> 02:17:22,960
断送彼此的生路
{\ren}Each standing in the other's light.

908
02:17:32,170 --> 02:17:34,800
我们怎么会失去善良本性?
{\ren}How did we lose the good that was given us?

909
02:17:36,600 --> 02:17:38,680
泯灭天理良知
{\ren}Let it slip away?

910
02:17:41,480 --> 02:17:43,560
将人性弃之不顾
{\ren}Scatter it careless?

911
02:18:04,250 --> 02:18:06,670
我们为什么无法升华?
{\ren}What's keeping us from reaching out?

912
02:18:07,290 --> 02:18:09,380
达到光荣的巅峰?
{\ren}Touching the glory?

913
02:18:11,420 --> 02:18:17,340
如果我是日军你早就死了
{\ren}I'd have had you, Witt, if you was a Jap,Long ago.

914
02:18:18,930 --> 02:18:21,010
你得留下来?
{\ren}They leave you here?

915
02:18:22,560 --> 02:18:24,060
对
{\ren}Yup.

916
02:18:24,140 --> 02:18:26,230
我会拖累他们
{\ren}I slowed 'em up.

917
02:18:26,900 --> 02:18:28,810
我不介意
{\ren}Don't mind, really.

918
02:18:29,820 --> 02:18:32,610
医官帮我包扎得很好
{\ren}The medic fixed me up pretty good.

919
02:18:32,730 --> 02:18:34,820
我有很多弹药
{\ren}I got plenty of ammo.

920
02:18:37,490 --> 02:18:40,120
一定会有人来接我
{\ren}Somebody'll be along for me eventually.

921
02:18:45,210 --> 02:18:47,500
- 你伤不轻 - 膝盖中弹
{\ren}- They got you good. - Right in the knee.

922
02:18:47,580 --> 02:18:49,290
是啊
{\ren}Yeah.

923
02:18:49,380 --> 02:18:51,960
我不必再打仗了 威特
{\ren}I'm out of this war for good, Witt.

924
02:18:57,260 --> 02:19:00,850
- 你在这儿干嘛? - 只是 你知道
{\ren}- What you doin' down here? - Just, you know,

925
02:19:00,930 --> 02:19:03,220
我要回到连上
{\ren}I'm heading back to the company.

926
02:19:03,890 --> 02:19:05,560
好
{\ren}Yeah.

927
02:19:06,390 --> 02:19:08,690
跟大伙儿问好
{\ren}Well, you give all them boys my best.

928
02:19:08,770 --> 02:19:11,230
你可以跟我来
{\ren}You can come with me if you want.

929
02:19:11,320 --> 02:19:13,440
我扶你
{\ren}I'll help you along.

930
02:19:15,070 --> 02:19:17,650
不了 这里很好
{\ren}No, it's nice and quiet.

931
02:19:17,740 --> 02:19:19,820
很安静
{\ren}Peaceful up here.

932
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:25,370
我会拖累你 剖队会接我
{\ren}I'd just slow you up. There'll be somebody along.

933
02:19:29,250 --> 02:19:31,340
我会提醒他们
{\ren}I'll remind 'em.

934
02:19:31,790 --> 02:19:33,880
好
{\ren}OK.

935
02:21:09,100 --> 02:21:11,180
嘿 威特
{\ren}Hey, Witt.

936
02:21:15,730 --> 02:21:17,900
今天你惹了什么麻烦?
{\ren}Who you making trouble for today?

937

{\ren}Well, isn't that what you like to do?

939
02:21:25,030 --> 02:21:27,700
叫你向左你偏偏向右
{\ren}Turn left when they say go right?

940
02:21:34,540 --> 02:21:37,040
你为什么这么爱惹麻烦?
{\ren}Why are you such a troublemaker, Witt?

941
02:21:39,460 --> 02:21:42,010
你很关心我 对吧?
{\ren}You care about me, don't you, Sergeant?

942
02:21:43,380 --> 02:21:45,470
我一直都这么觉得
{\ren}I always felt like you did.

943
02:21:47,300 --> 02:21:50,020
你为什么装得冷酷无情?
{\ren}Why do you always make yourself out like a rock?

944
02:21:51,310 --> 02:21:53,690
有时我跟你聊得很愉快
{\ren}One day I can come up and talk to you,

945
02:21:54,730 --> 02:21:58,610
隔一天 我们就像没见过面似的
{\ren}by the next day it's like we never even met.

946
02:22:12,950 --> 02:22:15,040
好孤单的房子
{\ren}Lonely house now.

947
02:22:17,710 --> 02:22:19,800
你会觉得孤单吗?
{\ren}You ever get lonely?

948
02:22:19,880 --> 02:22:21,960
只有在人群中

949
02:22:23,880 --> 02:22:25,970
只有在人群中

951
02:22:41,610 --> 02:22:43,690
你怎么办得到?

952
02:22:45,360 --> 02:22:47,450
你就像是魔术师
{\ren}You're a magician to me.

953
02:22:56,500 --> 02:22:58,580
你眼中仍有一丝良知
{\ren}I still see a spark in you.

954
02:23:23,640 --> 02:23:29,180
有人看到死去小鸟的眼中 只有无言的痛楚
{\ren}One man looks at a dying bird and thinks there's nothing but unanswered pain.

955
02:23:31,890 --> 02:23:33,980
不过死亡是无情的
{\ren}But death's got the final word.

956
02:23:37,070 --> 02:23:39,150
死神在嘲笑他
{\ren}It's laughing at him.

957
02:23:48,450 --> 02:23:50,950
有人看着同一只小鸟

958
02:23:53,870 --> 02:23:55,960
却看到生命光辉

959
02:24:01,010 --> 02:24:03,510
心中充满喜悦
{\ren}Feels something smiling through him.

960
02:25:00,860 --> 02:25:03,320
我们得马上撤退
{\ren}We need to get out of here right now.

961
02:25:03,400 --> 02:25:07,990
- 你跟指挥部说过吗? - 没有
{\ren}- You explain to... headquarters the situation? - No.

962
02:25:08,070 --> 02:25:12,160
他们知道我们在这儿吗?
{\ren}Do they know where we are? Cos we're sitting ducks out here.

963
02:25:13,330 --> 02:25:16,870
我们死定了 这要由我决定
{\ren}Well, I think that's... up to me to judge, Sergeant.

964
02:25:18,500 --> 02:25:24,090
我们得派人去看敌军有多近 好吗?
{\ren}I think we just need to send somebody up there and find out how close they are. OK?

965
02:25:24,170 --> 02:25:26,050
很容易
{\ren}It's easy.

966
02:25:26,130 --> 02:25:29,510
韦特 联络指挥部
{\ren}Hey, Weld... get headquarters on that thing.

967
02:25:29,590 --> 02:25:31,510
炮声越来越近
{\ren}The fire's coming closer, sir.

968
02:25:31,600 --> 02:25:32,640
没有讯号
{\ren}Line's cut!

969
02:25:35,640 --> 02:25:39,810
我们得派人查出原因
{\ren}We need to send somebody out there to find out where that line is being cut.

970
02:25:39,900 --> 02:25:42,520
和敌人有多近
{\ren}And we need to find out how close they are.

979
02:26:12,640 --> 02:26:17,680
要是他们全力进攻 我们肯定没命
{\ren}If they come down here in any strength, Lieutenant, they'll knock our position to hell.

980
02:26:17,770 --> 02:26:20,230
你不必去 别人会去
{\ren}You don't have to go. Others'll volunteer.

981
02:26:20,310 --> 02:26:25,440

{\ren}No, I wanna go, sir. In case something bad happens, I wanna be there.

982

好吧 顺着河走
{\ren}All right. You stay by the river.

993
02:29:46,350 --> 02:29:48,440
我们不会有事的

994
02:29:53,440 --> 02:29:56,440

{\ren}Just hide out here till you hear firing, then push on down the river.

1001
02:31:25,160 --> 02:31:26,620

1010
02:37:35,860 --> 02:37:37,120
没关系

1011
02:37:37,200 --> 02:37:38,910
一切都是谎言...

1012
02:37:38,990 --> 02:37:42,660
在我的部队可以尽管喝酒

{\ren}- So much to spew out. - I prefer to think of myself as a family man,

{\ren}and that's what we all are here, whether we like it or not.

你们都是我的孩子

一家之主是父亲
{\ren}Now, a family can have only one head, and that is the father.

1024
02:38:19,370 --> 02:38:24,040
男主外女主内 这就是规矩
{\ren}Father's the head, mother runs it. That's the way it's gonna work here.

1025
02:38:24,120 --> 02:38:27,830
- 要是你们想见我 - 我们被困在棺材里
{\ren}- If any of you wanna see me about anything, - You're in a box.

1031
02:38:42,850 --> 02:38:44,930
或相信他们的谎言
