What's this war in the heart of nature?

4
00:01:54,134 --> 00:01:56,636
The land contend with the sea?

I was afraid to touch the death seen in her.

也不觉得她蒙主荣召是一件好事

With the same... calm.

Look at you.

We've got good sergeants and good lieutenant colonels.
我们有好的中士和中校

- 没错 是不能 - 那就全力攻敌

你有没有想过日军为何在这儿盖机场?

他害大家被派上这艘鬼船

We're going straight up that hill there.

等你攻上山坡 找到敌军据点然后消灭他们

- 两组105榴弹炮 - 一点都没有用

00:59:24,631 --> 00:59:27,509
Well, then, you write her. Yeah, you write her.
你写给她吧

408
00:59:36,768 --> 00:59:39,062
What's wrong, Jim?
怎么回事?

409
01:00:59,601 --> 01:01:04,147
There's nothing anybody can do for him. He'll die before they get him to a surgeon.
他没救了 谁也救不了他

410
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:09,235
- Then I can't ask you to go out there. - Maybe I could get some morphine into him.
- 你不必去了 - 我可以替他注射吗啡

411
01:01:09,319 --> 01:01:12,572
- Would it keep him quiet? - Not for long, but I can give him two.
- 能让他安静吗? - 不能 我可以打两针

412
01:01:12,655 --> 01:01:16,075
And I could maybe leave him three or four for himself.
留三 四针给他自己打

413
01:01:18,161 --> 01:01:20,455
Couldn't you give 'em to him all at once?
你能一次打完吗?

414
01:01:38,932 --> 01:01:41,017
That's what you are.
你们都会死

415
01:01:42,727 --> 01:01:45,855
That's all there is for us. That's us, that's us.
我们全都会没命

416
01:01:46,439 --> 01:01:49,692
I lost all twelve. I lost all twelve.
我的十二名弟兄都死了

417
01:01:50,944 --> 01:01:52,862
All twelve of 'em.
全都挂了

418
01:01:52,946 --> 01:01:54,405
It's insanity up there.
太疯狂了

419
01:01:54,489 --> 01:01:58,576
I told 'em what to do, I showed 'em where to go and I gave 'em a push.
我叫他们勇往直前

420
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:03,998
- Somebody help! - I know you. I know you, Sergeant.
- 救命 - 我认得你...副连长

421

It's insane. I don't know who's in charge here, but don't let him go! Don't let him go!
这里谁指挥? 别放走他

422
01:02:08,878 --> 01:02:10,922
I'm outta here. I'm outta here.
我要走 我要走

423
01:02:11,005 --> 01:02:15,134
I'm outta here. All right, move feet. Move, move, move, move. Move, move!
两只脚 快走 走啊

424
01:02:15,218 --> 01:02:17,971
I'm moving. I'm moving. I'm moving now.
我要走了 我要走了...

425
01:02:18,054 --> 01:02:22,725
Don't touch. Don't touch. Don't look at me. Don't touch. OK, I'm outta here.
别碰我 别看我 别碰我 别看我 我走了

426
01:02:22,809 --> 01:02:24,811
All right. All right.
没事了 没事了

427
01:02:24,894 --> 01:02:27,855
All right. All right.
没事了 没事了

428
01:02:45,873 --> 01:02:48,001
Somebody help me!

Help me!

- OK. Calm down. - Fuck you!

432
01:02:56,801 --> 01:02:59,887
I'm dying! I'm dying, sarge!
我快死了 我快死了

433

OK. Well, goddamn it, do it with less noise!

Please, leave me alone.

Give me more. Give me more.

Give me more. Give me more.

Goodbye, sarge. Goodbye.
再见 副连长

446
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:24,472
Fortunately, Jim, the fate of the company doesn't depend on one man.
幸好部队不必只靠一个大兵

447
01:04:29,352 --> 01:04:32,438
Sergeant, I saw the whole thing through the glasses.
我用望远镜看到经过

448
01:04:32,522 --> 01:04:36,776
I'm gonna mention you in orders tomorrow and recommend you for the Silver Star.
我会请营长表扬你

449
01:04:36,859 --> 01:04:39,487
- It's the most courageous thing... - Captain,
- 我要替你争取银星勋章 - 长官

450
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:43,783
you say one more word to thank me, I'll knock you right in the teeth.
你再说下去我就把你揍扁

你去争取勋章 我马上辞职

452

and leave you here to run this busted-up outfit by yourself.
让你一个人指挥这个烂部队

453
01:04:52,959 --> 01:04:55,044
You understand?
懂不懂?

454
01:04:55,753 --> 01:04:59,507
Property! Whole fuckin' thing's about property.
权力! 打仗全是为了权力

455
01:05:14,439 --> 01:05:18,734
What's the matter with you, Staros? Those men should be reinforced immediately!
你在搞什么鬼? 马上派人支援他们

What are they doing? I can see 'em through my glasses.
他们在干嘛?

457
01:05:21,737 --> 01:05:23,823
They're lying behind that ledge!
躲在那里做什么?

458
01:05:23,906 --> 01:05:27,452
They should be up and out, cleaning out those machine guns! Over!
他们应该去消灭机关枪

459
01:05:27,535 --> 01:05:30,455
I don't think you understand what's going on, sir.
我想你不明白 长官

460
01:05:30,538 --> 01:05:33,416
We've had... heavy casualties.
我们的伤亡惨重

461
01:05:33,499 --> 01:05:38,379
We had a man... His gut got shot out on the slopes, sir. Created quite an upset.
有一个人的肠子被打出来 死得很惨

462
01:05:38,462 --> 01:05:41,632
Fine, fine. Now, what about those reinforcements? Over.
好吧 到底有没有支援?

463
01:05:41,716 --> 01:05:47,555
I have two squads to First Platoon I can send up, sir. Over.

Goddamn you, Staros! When I say reinforcements,
该死 我叫你支援就照办

马上派全体兄弟攻上去

467
01:05:58,524 --> 01:06:02,528
Your First Platoon, too. I see 'em lying on their fat asses doing nothing.
第一排也得去 我看到他们躺着不动

Get a man to 'em right now with orders to attack, and move 'em by the flank to the ridge.

while your men are getting their asses shot off?.

上校 你不明白这里的情况

475
01:06:26,135 --> 01:06:29,347
My company alone cannot take that position, sir.
光凭这一队不能攻下山头

476
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:32,934
The Japs are too well dug in. They've got too much fire power.

Colonel, there's a bunker up there.
上面有座碉堡

481
01:06:49,116 --> 01:06:51,744
can be outflanked with a manoeuvre there in force.
从右边包抄应该能攻下山头

01:06:51,827 --> 01:06:54,121
- No! Goddamn it, no! - Might save lives!
- 不行 该死 - 挽救生命

483
01:06:54,205 --> 01:06:56,082
There'll be no flanking move.

Listen, Staros. You're not gonna take your men

around into the jungle to avoid a goddamn fight!

史塔奥 快进攻 这是命令

我必须违背你的命令

489
01:07:37,957 --> 01:07:41,919
- There it is, right there. See it? - I don't see it.
- 在那里 能看见吗? - 看不见

490
01:07:42,670 --> 01:07:45,464
This is not your fault, Jim. He's ordering you to.
你没有错 他下了命令

491
01:07:49,010 --> 01:07:54,473
I again request permission for patrol reconnaissance around to the right in force.
我请你让我派人到丛林搜查

现在时间是...13时21分25秒

493
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:04,525
I have two witnesses here. I request that you do the same with witnesses there. Over.
两名证人听到我的话 请你也找证人

494
01:08:09,697 --> 01:08:13,242
Staros, don't pull this guardhouse-lawyer bullshit with me!
别给我来律师那一套

495
01:08:13,326 --> 01:08:17,455
Now, I know you're a goddamn lawyer! This is not a court of law.
你是律师 这里却不是法庭

496
01:08:17,538 --> 01:08:19,790
This is a war. It's a goddamn battle!
这是战场 我们在打仗

497
01:08:19,874 --> 01:08:24,754
Now, I want that frontal attack. I repeat my order. Over.
我重覆 我要你正面攻击

498
01:08:24,837 --> 01:08:28,507
Colonel, I refuse to take my men up there in a frontal attack.
我拒绝率领兄弟作正面攻击

499
01:08:28,591 --> 01:08:30,760
It's suicide, sir.
这等于是自杀

500
01:08:30,843 --> 01:08:36,015
I've lived with these men for two years, and I will not order them all to their deaths. Over.
我和他们生活两年半 不能命令他们送死 完毕

501
01:08:45,024 --> 01:08:47,610
This is a very important decision, Staros.
这是很重大的决定

502
01:08:51,197 --> 01:08:55,034
But if you feel that strongly, maybe you have a reason, so I'm coming down.

503
01:08:55,117 --> 01:08:57,495
Go take a look.

504
01:08:57,578 --> 01:09:00,289
I'm not rescinding my order to you, son,
我不是取消命令

505
01:09:00,373 --> 01:09:05,211
but if I find extenuating circumstances when I get there, I'll take that into account.
不过如果是特殊状况 我会仔细考虑

506
01:09:05,294 --> 01:09:09,590
Now, in the meantime, goddamn it, I want you to hold on until I get there.
你们守在那儿等我来

507
01:09:09,673 --> 01:09:13,886

One spot's as good as another, men.

There's no place to hide.

Just take it easy, son. Take it easy. Take it easy.

Where's... where's Fife?

Shut up in a tomb.

Played a role I never conceived.

What you aiming at, son? Let's go get those son of a bitches.

Move up!

Observing, sir. Just sent First Platoon forward to the ridge.
我正在观察 我派第一排上去

- 现在 没有 - 好吧 你得照我的方法

536
01:12:40,384 --> 01:12:42,803
My way! You understand that, Captain?
让我来指挥

537
01:12:42,886 --> 01:12:47,182
We're taking everybody over to that ledge! We may take that ridge by nightfall!
大家上去 晚上得攻下来

538
01:12:47,266 --> 01:12:51,145
I think the ridge is quite a way from being reduced, sir.
上面的火力还是很强

539
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:00,821
Show me how to see things the way you do.
神啊 你到底看到什么?

540
01:13:04,033 --> 01:13:06,368
Show me how to see things the way you do.
让我知道你看到什么

541
01:13:09,705 --> 01:13:12,833
We're just dirt. We're just dirt.
我们全是尘土

542
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,943
We're gonna get killed if we stay here.
留在这儿肯定送命

543
01:13:39,026 --> 01:13:42,279
Bell, take six men
比尔 带六个弟兄

544
01:13:42,363 --> 01:13:44,448
and go see what's up there.
上去探查

545
01:13:49,828 --> 01:13:52,873
And we'll cover you the best we can from down there.
我们会掩护你们

546
01:15:12,619 --> 01:15:14,079
OK.
好

547
01:15:14,163 --> 01:15:16,665
You guys, you guys, stay here. OK?
你们留下来

548
01:15:17,791 --> 01:15:19,877
I'm going alone.
我一个人去

549
01:16:59,476 --> 01:17:01,562
Come out.
来吧

550
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:08,986
Come out where lam.
到我的身边

551
01:18:17,471 --> 01:18:20,224
There was a... There was a...
上面有...上面有...

552
01:18:21,516 --> 01:18:24,228
There's a bunker... up there.
上面有一座碉堡

553
01:18:26,063 --> 01:18:28,148
It's five guns.
总共有五支机关枪

554
01:18:28,482 --> 01:18:30,776
It's five guns.
五支机关枪

555
01:18:35,197 --> 01:18:40,077
That strongpoint up there, somewhere up there around those rocks,
攻下那些乱石间的碉堡

556
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,246
is the key to this ridge.
就能攻下这座山头

557
01:18:45,332 --> 01:18:47,459
Bell here is quite right.
比尔说得没错

558
01:18:47,542 --> 01:18:53,257
From their knob up there, those little brown brothers can cover the whole of the ground
日本鬼子从上面

559
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:57,678
in front of this position for 1,000 yards. They've left this ledge unguarded.
可以扫射一千码内的目标 不过他们漏掉这地方

560
01:18:57,761 --> 01:19:01,723
Now, goddamn it, that's a mistake. That's a hell of a mistake.
这是很严重的错误 这是很严重的错误

561
01:19:01,807 --> 01:19:05,978
We need to take advantage of it before they see their error.
我们得利用他们的疏忽

562
01:19:08,397 --> 01:19:11,858
All right, all right, I know you're all pretty exhausted,
我知道你们筋疲力尽

563
01:19:11,942 --> 01:19:15,404
and we've had a hell of a time getting water up here.
这里连清水也没有

564
01:19:16,279 --> 01:19:19,199
For that I'm sorry. I apologise to you all.
对不起 我向大家道歉

565
01:19:20,325 --> 01:19:24,997
But if we can reduce this bunker tomorrow, I think we can take this ridge.
不过明天若能攻下这座碉堡 就能占领山头

566
01:19:27,833 --> 01:19:30,168
So I'm asking for volunteers.
有没有人自愿

567
01:19:30,252 --> 01:19:32,504
Go back up there and knock it out.
回去攻下那座碉堡

568
01:19:32,587 --> 01:19:34,673
Sir?
长官

569
01:19:34,756 --> 01:19:36,842
I'll be glad to go back up
我愿意...

570
01:19:36,925 --> 01:19:39,261
- and lead the way back for a party. - Right.
- 身先士卒回去作战 - 很好 比尔

571
01:19:39,344 --> 01:19:41,054
- I'll go, sir. - You.
- 上校 我也去 - 还有你

572
01:19:41,805 --> 01:19:43,265
All right.
好的

573
01:19:43,348 --> 01:19:48,186
- I'd like to lead the party, Colonel. - All right, John. I was hoping you'd say that.
- 我很想率领突击队 - 我正希望你去 约翰

574
01:19:48,270 --> 01:19:51,189
- You'll be in command. - I'll go, sir.
- 你来指挥 - 我要去

575
01:19:51,273 --> 01:19:52,649
- Sir? - You.
- 长官 - 你

576
01:19:52,733 --> 01:19:56,737
All right, men, that's enough. Seven is plenty. Gather up.
够了 七个人够多了 准备出发

577
01:20:00,532 --> 01:20:05,037
I don't know if you realise the importance of this operation, Staros.
史塔奥 你知道这一役有多重要吗?

578
01:20:06,204 --> 01:20:09,624
Once our position is secured, we can move the bombers in.
攻下这座岛 轰炸机就能降落

579
01:20:09,708 --> 01:20:13,670
That means air power for 1,000 miles in every direction.
我们的军队 便有一千英里的空中攻击力

580
01:20:15,088 --> 01:20:18,216
Guadalcanal may be the turning point in the war.
窝达康拉尔岛一役能决定胜负

581
01:20:19,342 --> 01:20:22,929
- It'll cost lives. Is that what's troubling you? - No, sir.
- 你不同意 一定得牺牲性命? - 不是 长官

582
01:20:26,058 --> 01:20:29,061
I explained to you the importance of this objective.
我跟你说过胜利的重要

583
01:20:29,144 --> 01:20:32,355
How many men do you think it's worth? How many lives?
你认为牺牲多少兄弟才值得?

584
01:20:32,439 --> 01:20:34,524
I can't say, sir.
我不知道

585
01:20:40,422 --> 01:20:45,660
Are you prepared to sacrifice the lives of any of your men in this campaign?
你愿意牺牲你的兄弟吗?

586
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:50,245
How many? One? Two?
多少? 一个? 两个?

587
01:20:50,805 --> 01:20:52,891
Twenty?
二十个?

588
01:20:54,309 --> 01:20:57,437
Lives will be lost in your company, Captain.
你的小队一定会死人

589
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:03,193
And if you don't have the stomach for it, now is the time to let me know.
要是你受不了 现在最好让我知道

590
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:07,989
No, sir. You're right... about everything you said.
不 你说得对 你说得都对

591
01:21:08,072 --> 01:21:10,158
Fine, fine.
好吧 没事了

592
01:21:10,241 --> 01:21:12,327
That's all, Captain.
好吧 长官

593
01:21:14,037 --> 01:21:16,122
One more thing, Staros.
还有一件事

594
01:21:16,873 --> 01:21:21,169
It's not necessary for you to ever tell me that you think I'm right.
你不必跟我说我说得对

595
01:21:21,753 --> 01:21:23,421
Ever.
没有必要

596
01:21:23,504 --> 01:21:25,840
We'll assume it.
这是理所当然的

597
01:21:25,924 --> 01:21:27,800
Dismissed.
解散

598
01:21:44,609 --> 01:21:46,694
I feel sorry for you, kid.
我为你感到遗憾

599
01:21:48,071 --> 01:21:50,156
- Yeah? - Yeah, a little.
- 是吗? - 有一点吧

600
01:21:53,618 --> 01:21:55,703
This army's gonna kill you.
这场仗会害死你

601
01:21:59,207 --> 01:22:05,171
If you were smart, you'd take care of yourself. There's nothing you can do for anybody else.
你还是保佑自己好运点 别想救别人了

602
01:22:05,255 --> 01:22:09,425
You're just running into a burning house where nobody can be saved.
就算你拼命也救不了什么人

603
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:27,110
What difference do you think you can make? One single man in all this madness.
在乱世中一个人的力量很渺小

604
01:22:32,657 --> 01:22:35,076
If you die, it's gonna be for nothing.
不要白白送死

605
01:22:39,205 --> 01:22:43,876
There's not some other world out there where everything's gonna be OK.
没有另一个美好世界

606
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:46,045
There's just this one.
这是唯一的世界

607
01:22:47,964 --> 01:22:50,049
Just this rock.
只有这座孤岛

608
01:23:27,003 --> 01:23:29,505
Go ahead! Come on, come on.
来吧 让我死吧

609
01:23:29,589 --> 01:23:32,717
Who's deciding who's gonna live?
谁能决定别人的生?

610
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,511
Who's deciding who's gonna die?
谁能决定别人的死?

611
01:23:37,388 --> 01:23:39,474
This is futile!
太荒谬了

612
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:46,022
Look at me! I stand right up here and not one bullet.
看看我 我身上没有中弹

613
01:23:46,105 --> 01:23:48,191
Not one shot!
毫发未伤!

614
01:23:49,108 --> 01:23:50,985
Why?
为什么?

615
01:23:51,277 --> 01:23:53,363
How come they all had to die?
他们全都死了

616
01:23:53,446 --> 01:23:57,909
I can stand right here, I can stand right up and nothing happens to me!
我却站在这儿 一点事也没有

617
01:24:18,429 --> 01:24:20,515
We.
我们

618
01:24:27,063 --> 01:24:29,148
We together.
我们在一起

619
01:24:39,867 --> 01:24:41,953
One being.
合而为一

620
01:24:56,968 --> 01:24:59,262
Flow together like water,
水乳交融

621
01:25:02,557 --> 01:25:04,851
till I can't tell you from me.
分不出你和我

622
01:25:22,743 --> 01:25:24,829
I drink you.
我爱你

623
01:25:26,873 --> 01:25:28,958
Now.

01:26:15,338 --> 01:26:17,423
My guide.
我的指引

627
01:27:26,284 --> 01:27:29,954
John, I'll be behind you. If you wanna break through, we'll come after.
我们在后面 要是攻破防线

628
01:27:30,037 --> 01:27:32,582
We'll charge at your whistle signal.
就吹哨子通知我们冲上去

629
01:27:33,332 --> 01:27:35,835
All right, let's go, men. Go get 'em.
去吧 去杀敌吧

630
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:32,243
OK.
好

631
01:29:33,244 --> 01:29:35,913
Stay down, below this ledge,
你们留在底下

632
01:29:35,996 --> 01:29:40,000
and I'll call down the data from above.
我从上面叫出敌人方位

633
01:29:40,084 --> 01:29:44,672
Once the 81s have plastered that rock... as much as possible,
让炮兵密集轰炸这些岩石

634
01:29:44,755 --> 01:29:48,551
we're gonna crawl out along that big rock for cover
再到大石旁找掩护

635
01:29:50,052 --> 01:29:52,138
and then flank 'em to the right.
然后从右翼进攻

636
01:29:52,221 --> 01:29:54,098
OK?
好吗?

01:29:55,599 --> 01:29:58,185
