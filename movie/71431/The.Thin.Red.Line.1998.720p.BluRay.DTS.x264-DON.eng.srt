1
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,750
What's this war in the heart of nature?

2
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,840
Why does nature vie with itself?

3
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,630
The land contend with the sea?

4
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,770
Is there an avenging power in nature?

5
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,150
Not one power, but two?

6
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,520
I remember my mother when she was dying.

7
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,940
Looked all shrunk up and grey.

8
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,400
I asked her if she was afraid.

9
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,200
She just shook her head.

10
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,410
I was afraid to touch the death seen in her.

11
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:49,160
I couldn't find nothing beautiful or up lifting about her going back to God.

12
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:56,600
I heard people talk about immortality, but I ain't seen it.

13
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,490
I wondered how it'd be when I died.

14
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,540
What it'd be like to know that this breath now was the last one you was ever gonna draw.

15
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,010
I just hope I can meet it the same way she did.

16
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,800
With the same... calm.

17
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:33,480
Cos that's where it's hidden - the immortality I hadn't seen.

18
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,230
Kids around here never fight.

19
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,770
Sometimes.

20
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,860
Sometimes when you see them playing

21
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,110
they always fight!

22
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,580
- Is she afraid of me? - Little bit.

23
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,330
- Are you afraid of me? - Yes.

24
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,540
- Why? - Cos you look...

25
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,960
You look as an army!

26
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,130
- I look army? - Yes.

27
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,970
Well, that don't matter.

28
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,770
It doesn't matter.

29
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,310
- Baby's tired. - Yes.

30
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,360
If she swims, she wants, she will sleep.

31
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,260
All right, come on. Turn around.

32
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,430
Go, go, go, go. Go!

33
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,350
Come on, go.

34
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,360
Go, go, go, go!

35
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,040
Witt, patrol boat!She's American.

36
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,020
What's it doing out here all alone?

37
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,840
You haven't changed at all, have you, Witt?

38
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,210
You haven't learned a thing.

39
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:18,550
All a man has to do is leave it to you, you'll put your head in the noose for him.

40
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,020
How many times you been AWOL?

41
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,730
Been in the army, what? Six years now?

42
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,820
Ain't it time you smartened up and stopped being such a punk recruit?

43
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,990
I mean, if you're ever gonna.

44
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,160
We can't all be smart.

45
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,250
No, we can't, and that's a shame.

46
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,420
Look at you.

47
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,380
Truth is, you can't take straight duty in my company.

48
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,350
You'll never be a real soldier, not in God's world.

49
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,730
This is C Company, of which I'm First Sergeant. I run this outfit.

50
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,650
Captain Staros, he's the CO, but I'm the guy who runs it. Nobody's gonna foul that up.

51
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,570
You're just another mouth for me to feed.

52
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,950
Normally, you'd be court-martialled.

53
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,540
But I worked a deal for ya.

54
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,710
Gotta consider yourself lucky.

55
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm sending you to a disciplinary outfit.

56
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:36,510
You'll be a stretcher-bearer. You'll be taking care of the wounded.

57
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,800
I can take anything you dish out.

58
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,220
I'm twice the man you are.

59
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,780
In this world...

60
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,530
a man himself is nothing.

61
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,250
And there ain't no world but this one.

62
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,040
You're wrong there, Top.

63
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,920
I seen another world.

64
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,390
Sometimes I think it was just... my imagination.

65
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,900
Well,

66
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,690
then you've seen things I never will.

67
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:50,870
We're living in a world that's blowing itself to hell as fast as everybody can arrange it.

68
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:56,800
In a situation like that all a man can do is shut his eyes and let nothing touch him.

69
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,960
Look out for himself.

70
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,940
I might be the best friend you ever had.

71
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,230
You don't even know it.

72
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:52,100
He hates you worse than poison.

73
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,360
I never felt he hated me, cos I don't hate him.

74
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,400
I love Charlie Company.

75
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,450
They're my people.

76
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,230
They call it "The Rock".

77
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,560
Nobody wants this island. Japs just put an airfield there.

78
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,520
Fighting's confined to this area.

79
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:28,200
This is their road to Australia, and this is their way of controlling the sea lanes to America.

80
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:33,490
If we're gonna stop the Japs' advance into the South Pacific, we've gotta do it right there.

81
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,080
The Marines have done their job. Now it's our turn.

82
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,630
Worked my ass off.

83
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,260
Brown-nosed the generals.

84
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,590
Degraded myself

85
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,640
for them and my family.

86
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,020
For my home.

87
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,980
- I admire you, Colonel. I do. - Thank you, sir.

88
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,030
Most men your age would have retired by now.

89
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:07,190
It's OK.

90
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,910
We need general officers with maturity and character like you.

91
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,370
We've got good sergeants and good lieutenant colonels.

92
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,830
But once a man gets those eagles, he can't wait to get that star.

93
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:21,000
He becomes a politician, right?

94
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,170
Goes along to get along.

95
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,880
So goddamn hard to stay upright.

96
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:32,010
- You said it there, sir. - With the Admiral watching, which he will be.

97
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,010
- There's always someone watching. - Yeah.

98
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,060
Like a hawk.

99
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,310
Always someone ready to jump in, if you're not.

100
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,740
- D'you have a son, Colonel? - Yes, sir.

101
00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:00,250
Good. We don't want our sons or grandsons fighting this war 30 years from now, do we?

102
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,880
- No, sir, we sure don't. - Then you crush 'em without mercy.

103
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,000
You dig them out of the hills and protect that airfield.

104
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,960
Yes, sir.

105
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:15,220
You wonder why... Why did the Japs put an airfield there of all places?

106
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,390
I guess we don't know the bigger picture, if there is such a thing.

107
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:23,560
- What do you think? - Well, sir, I never ask myself that question.

108
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,310
You're a humble man.

109
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,650
Nobody wants that island... but you.

110
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,240
How much do you want it?

111
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,740
As much as I have to, sir.

112
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,660
All they sacrificed for me

113
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,460
poured out like water on the ground.

114
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,180
All I might have given for love's sake.

115
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,780
Too late.

116
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,700
Died...

117
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,210
slow as a tree.

118
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,540
D'you feel it?

119
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,340
Yes, sir.

120
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,550
Thank you, sir.

121
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,540
The closer you are to Caesar, the greater the fear.

122
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,850
I just can't help how damn scared I am, sarge, all right?

123
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,560
I can't help it. I got...

124
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,020
My stepdaddy took a block and beat me when I was real little

125
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,900
and I was scared and I used to run, I used to hide.

126
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,650
Hell, I slept in the chicken coop a whole lot of nights.

127
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:39,910
And I never thought it'd get no worse than that.

128
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,040
But I'm living by the... by the minute here. I'm counting the seconds.

129
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,580
Hell, we're gonna be landing soon and there's gonna be air raids.

130
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:53,130
We're probably gonna die before we get off the beach.

131
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:57,220
This place is... It's like a big floating graveyard.

132
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,510
- What's your name, kid? - I wanna own an automobile when I get out.

133
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,770
- What's your name? - Edward, Edward B Train.

134
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:06,930
Train?

135
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:12,440
The only things that are permanent is, is dying and the Lord. That's it.

136
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:18,440
That's all you gotta worry about. This war ain't... gonna be the end of me or you neither.

137
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,860
- Think we'll catch an air raid? - How in the hell should I know?

138
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:26,700
All's I know are them crew guys said they didn't catch no air raid the last time.

139
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:30,370
On the other hand, time before last they nearly got blew up.

140
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,330
What d'you want me to tell you?

141
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,460
You're a big help, Tills. Nothing. Tell me nothing.

142
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,010
Tell you something.

143
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:41,680
We're sitting out here on this ocean like a couple of fuckin' ducks in these boats.

144
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,720
I already know that.

145
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,560
Well, brood on it, Tills.

146
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,930
Brood on it.

147
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,440
- Ain't you watching the fun? - I ain't interested.

148
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,980
- Yeah, I guess it is pretty crowded. - Wouldn't be interested, even if it wasn't.

149
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,860
Well, I'm on my way to get me that pistol.

150
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,610
Yeah? Well, have fun.

151
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,910
Yeah, have fun.

152
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:07,830
You'll wish you had one once we get ashore and run into some of them samurai sabres.

153
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:11,540
Open this door! Open this goddamn door!

154
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,500
Open the door!

155
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:39,110
I never bargained for nothing like this when I signed up for this man's army before the war.

156
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:43,990
How was I supposed to know there was gonna be a fuckin' war, huh? Answer me that.

157
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,950
All I know is Charlie Company's always getting screwed. Always.

158
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,790
And I can tell you whose fault it is, too.

159
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,830
It's that captain of ours.

160
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,710
First he gets us stuck off on this boat where we don't know a fucking soul.

161
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:06,260
Then he gets us stuck way down in fourth place on the list to get off this son of a bitch.

162
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,030
Hello, Captain.

163
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:09,740
I read in your 201 file that you were an officer before the war.

164
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,490
How'd you end up a private?

165
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,660
Cos of my wife.

166
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,620
I was in the corps of engineers.

167
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,880
We'd never been separated before,

168
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,050
not even for a night.

169
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,890
I took it for four months and then I quit.

170
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,890
Just resigned.

171
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,600
They sent me back to the States.

172
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,770
They told me I'd never get another commission.

173
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:45,530
They said they'd see to it I got drafted and that I for damn sure'd be in the infantry.

174
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,240
Sons of bitches.

175
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,950
No, I don't blame them.

176
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,450
Well, where is she now?

177
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,410
She's home.

178
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,220
Why should i be afraid to die?

179
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,310
I belong to you.

180
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,400
Move! Move! Move!

181
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,570
Move! Move!

182
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,950
Move! Move!

183
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,280
Moving out!

184
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:39,540
If i go first, I'll wait for you there.

185
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,290
On the otherside of the dark waters.

186
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,680
Put your helmet on.

187
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,890
Be with me now.

188
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,440
- Feeling the pressure, Captain? - Yes, sir.

189
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,110
I like you, Captain.

190
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,700
And I just want you to know, well, we're in this thing together. All right?

191
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:21,870
Keep pressing inland till you reach the line. I'll catch up with you there.

192
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,830
- Yes, sir. - It's all yours, Captain.

193
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,380
Gangway! Gangway there!

194
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,920
Coming through!

195
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,920
Squad leaders! Both teams!

196
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:33,340
This way, son. This way, right here.

197
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,470
Stand by to go over the side!

198
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,280
Our Father, who art in heaven...

199
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:56,160
And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.

200
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,870
For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory.

201
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,640
Your outfit's lucky.

202
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,810
Transports must've been spotted.

203
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,810
You're getting outta here just ahead of time.

204
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,700
Take a breath, mister. You gotta breathe!

205
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,520
- You Charlie Company? - Yeah.

206
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,690
We went in a mile. Nothing there.

207
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:09,320
Some oil drums. There'd be nothing there for...

208
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,780
- A week. - A week, sir.

209
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,320
No casualties. Japs must've hauled ass.

210
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,450
Two mortars hit the beach, but most guys came in standing up.

211
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,410
Darnedest thing I ever did see.

212
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,460
They got fish that live in trees.

213
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:31,630
If they didn't know this beach was deserted, what else don't they know?

214
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,640
Who are you to live in all these many forms?

215
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,140
Your death that captures all.

216
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,480
You, too, are the source of all that's gonna be born.

217
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,710
Your glory.

218
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,090
Mercy.

219
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,720
Peace.

220
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,770
Truth.

221
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,690
You give calm a spirit,

222
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,820
understanding,

223
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,700
courage.

224
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,460
The contented heart.

225
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,850
Get a medic here!

226
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:47,650
Maybe all men got one big soul who everybody's a part of.

227
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,860
All faces of the same man.

228
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,200
One big self.

229
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,530
Everyone looking for salvation by himself.

230
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:44,870
Each like a coal drawn from the fire.

231
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:19,740
We're going straight up that hill there.

232
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:27,500
- We can't do that, Colonel. - Well, there's no way to outflank it.

233
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,500
On the left is a cliff that falls down into the river.

234
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:34,380
The Japanese hold the jungle. It has to be taken frontally.

235
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:39,510
What about water, sir? It's not getting up here.

236
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,010
My men are... passing out, sir.

237
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:53,690
Only time you worry about a soldier is when he stops bitching.

238
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:11,210
We're all gonna attack abreast. Third Platoon in reserve.

239
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:14,670
We've gotta cross those three folds of ground. You see?

240
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,550
Once we get beyond that, we gotta attack that hill.

241
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:34,400
Colonel says there's no way to outflank it, so we gotta take it head-on by frontal assault.

242
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,610
- Whyte? - Yeah?

243
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,700
- See the grassy ridges at the foot of that hill? - Yeah.

244
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:45,790
When you get to the end of that field, eliminate all strong points on those ridges.

245
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,090
I'm sure the Japs got something there to protect the approaches.

246
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,280
Are you here?

247
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,670
Let me not betray you.

248
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,470
Let me not betray my men.

249
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,440
In you I place my trust.

250
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:39,540
Rosy-fingered dawn.

251
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,460
You're Greek, aren't you, Captain?

252
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,630
D'you ever read Homer?

253
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:50,220
We read Homer at the Point.In Greek.

254
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,800
What kind of artillery support do we have, sir? Over.

255
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:58,470
- Two batteries of 105s. - They won't make a dent. Over.

256
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,940
No, but it bucks the men up. It'll look like the Japs are catching hell.

257
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,660
OK, you guys.

258
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,410
This is it.

259
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,000
We're going down in groups often.

260
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:08,880
There's no point in going by rushes. Only make a better target stopped, so...

261
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,300
run all the way.

262
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,720
We ain't got no choice. We're picked, so we gotta go.

263
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:20,140
I'm gonna take the first bunch myself.

264
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,560
I want Charlie Dale with me. Dale?

265
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,350
You go organise them guys that's up there.

266
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:33,360
Moving out in five minutes.

267
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,860
Let's go.

268
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,950
Sico?

269
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:45,710
- What's wrong with you? - I'm sick to my stomach.

270
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:49,130
Sico, you get up now, or I'll kick you so hard you're gonna be sick.

271
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,000
I can't. I would if I could.

272
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:53,420
I'm sick.

273
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:55,380
I'm sick.

274
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:57,550
You ain't sick. Get up!

275
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:05,270
- What's the matter, Sico? - I don't know, Sergeant.

276
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:08,520
It's my stomach. I'm in pain, I got cramps.

277
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,860
I can't even sit up straight. I'm sick.

278
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,740
- Come on, get up! - Leave him.

279
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:21,080
I need a volunteer to carry the BAR! Drop your gear. I'm taking you to the medics.

280
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,240
Thank you, Sergeant.

281
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,620
Don't argue with me.

282
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:29,790
Good luck, Keck.

283
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,770
Maybe they pulled out.

284
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,150
Hit dirt!

285
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,480
Hit dirt!

286
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:21,320
Calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down.

287
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,160
Stretcher-bearers!

288
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:45,510
Come on!

289
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,680
Stretcher-bearers, this way!

290
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:51,980
- Go get that man. - We already got eight or nine down there...

291
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:56,110
- Don't argue with me! Get that man! - He's not the one we should think about...

292
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:59,490
Goddamn it, all of you! Am I in command here or am I not?!

293
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:03,660
- Am I the captain or a goddamn private? - Others are hit bad. That's all I meant.

294
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,750
- I gave you an order, private! - Yes, sir!

295
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,170
Hello, First Sergeant.

296
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,340
Who we going after over here?

297
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:19,220
We think it's Jacques.

298
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,430
Ol' Jockey.

299
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:24,220
Well, shit. That's, that's, that's too bad.

300
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,180
Sir?

301
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:32,140
Sir? Sir, can I come back to the company after we get Jockey back to the battalion?

302
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:37,070
- OK, but you gotta get permission. - Sure. And my rifle.

303
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:42,530
Nicky! You're still alive!

304
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:45,320
Keep moving! Keep moving!

305
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:52,420
Magnificent, Staros, magnificent. The finest thing these old eyes have seen in a long time!

306
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:57,000
Beautifully conceived and executed! You'll be mentioned in battalion orders.

307
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:59,630
Young Whyte led beautifully.

308
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:01,800
Yes, sir. Over.

309
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,760
But sending in your second too was brilliant.

310
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:10,350
They may have carried the ridge. I don't think they were hurt too bad. Blane led well, too.

311
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:13,230
Now, how many emplacements did they locate?

312
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:15,400
Did they knock any out?

313
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:19,530
We ought to have those ridges cleaned out by noon! Over.

314
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:23,950
Hello! Hello! Staros, are you there?

315
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:26,280
Here, sir. Over.

316
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:31,250
I said, how many emplacements did they locate? Did they knock any out? Over.

317
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:33,710
Children.

318
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:36,630
I don't know, sir.

319
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:41,210
What the hell do you mean, you don't know? How can you not know? Over.

320
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:45,630
I'm right here behind the first swell, sir. I'm right here behind the swell.

321
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,050
You want me to stand up and wave? Over.

322
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:51,350
No, I can see where you are. I want you to do something.

323
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:54,640
I want you to get up there and see what the situation is.

324
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:56,980
I want Hill 210 in my hands tonight.

325
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:00,400
Now, goddamn it, the Admiral got up at dawn for this!

326
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,940
Come to life up there, Staros. Out!

327
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,390
Move up!

328
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,200
Hey, Keck!

329
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:54,290
Yeah?

330
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:57,540
- We gotta get out of here. - I know it.

331
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,420
Blane's dead.

332
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,590
You're in charge.

333
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:08,680
We know you there, Yank!

334
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:11,550
Tojo eats shit!

335
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,890
No! Roosevelt eats shit!

336
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,550
I got him! I got him!

337
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:12,570
I killed a man.

338
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,740
Hey, Queen!

339
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:17,330
Queen, you there?

340
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:21,460
Worst thing you can do. Worse than rape.

341
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:24,500
Queen! You see them Japs leaving that left ridge?

342
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:28,420
- I killed a man. Nobody can touch me for it. - I ain't seen nothing.

343
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:31,550
Well, get your fuckin' head up and look around!

344
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:35,100
I'm serious!

345
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:39,100
I counted seven Japs leaving that left-hand grassy ridge!

346
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,690
I got me one of 'em.

347
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:43,020
So?

348
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,360
I think maybe they're pulling out.

349
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:51,070
Maybe somebody ought to go tell the captain.

350
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:52,700
You wanna be the one to do it?

351
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:01,160
You just stay put! I'm ordering you!

352
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:25,730
Down!

353
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:36,490
Stay low.

354
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:05,140
Go! Go!

355
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:07,440
Go! Go!

356
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:50,360
What do we do now?

357
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,610
We wait right here. Maybe they'll send us up some reinforcements.

358
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:56,150
To do what?

359
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,280
To capture some of these fucking positions around here!

360
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:04,830
- You mean you really wanna go on with this? - Hell, no. No, not no uphill charge.

361
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:08,580
If they send us reinforcements, maybe we could scout around

362
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:10,750
and locate these machine guns.

363
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:14,840
- Anyway, it's better than going back down. - Something's coming!

364
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,840
They're coming!

365
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:23,600
What are they doin'?

366
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,770
If they want to throw us out, why didn't they come in force?

367
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:29,060
Maybe they was acting on their own.

368
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,070
Maybe they wanted to get into nirvana.

369
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:36,440
They're coming.

370
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,660
Keck!

371
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:49,160
Jesus!

372
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:51,330
Oh, Jesus!

373
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,590
I blew my butt off!

374
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:58,090
- It's all right. It's all right. - I blew my butt off!

375
00:56:58,170 --> 00:56:59,630
Lay down!

376
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,470
What a fucking recruit trick to pull!

377
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:05,560
- Take it easy. Take it easy. - I grabbed it by the pin!

378
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:10,690
You write my old lady. You tell her... I want her to know I died like a man.

379
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:13,110
Nobody's gonna have to write her. You'll make it.

380
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:15,070
- Don't bullshit me! - Stay down!

381
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:17,230
Hey, hey.

382
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,110
Have I got mud on my face?

383
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,280
Wipe it off. Get it off.

384
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:25,870
No!

385
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:28,040
I'll write her. I promise.

386
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:35,260
Take my canteen. There's still some water in there.

387
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:42,140
It's for the best.

388
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:45,310
I'm all messed up down there.

389
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,570
I can't fuck no more.

390
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:54,320
Whoa... Where am I?

391
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:57,450
Where am I?

392
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:02,580
You're gonna be all right.

393
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:06,790
Even if you die, you didn't let your brother down.

394
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,590
If you hadn't thrown yourself against that embankment, we'd all have been killed.

395
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:13,760
I'm cold.

396
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:18,350
I'm cold.

397
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,680
I'm... freezing.

398
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:18,860
You gonna write his wife?

399
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:22,150
Fuck, no.

400
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:24,650
I don't know his old lady.

401
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:29,780
That's the company commander's job. You outta your mind? I ain't no good at writing.

402
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:31,950
You told him you would.

403
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:35,830
I'll say anything to 'em when they're like that.

404
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:38,540
Somebody ought to do it.

405
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:41,500
Well, then, you write her. Yeah, you write her.

406
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,060
What's wrong, Jim?

407
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:18,140
There's nothing anybody can do for him. He'll die before they get him to a surgeon.

408
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:23,230
- Then I can't ask you to go out there. - Maybe I could get some morphine into him.

409
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:26,570
- Would it keep him quiet? - Not for long, but I can give him two.

410
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:30,070
And I could maybe leave him three or four for himself.

411
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,450
Couldn't you give 'em to him all at once?

412
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:55,010
That's what you are.

413
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,850
That's all there is for us. That's us, that's us.

414
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:03,690
I lost all twelve. I lost all twelve.

415
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:06,860
All twelve of 'em.

416
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:08,400
It's insanity up there.

417
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,570
I told 'em what to do, I showed 'em where to go and I gave 'em a push.

418
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:17,990
- Somebody help! - I know you. I know you, Sergeant.

419
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:22,790
It's insane. I don't know who's in charge here, but don't let him go! Don't let him go!

420
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:24,920
I'm outta here. I'm outta here.

421
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,130
I'm outta here. All right, move feet. Move, move, move, move. Move, move!

422
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:31,970
I'm moving. I'm moving. I'm moving now.

423
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:36,720
Don't touch. Don't touch. Don't look at me. Don't touch. OK, I'm outta here.

424
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,810
All right. All right.

425
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:41,850
All right. All right.

426
01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:02,000
Somebody help me!

427
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,330
Help me!

428
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:08,210
You gotta be quiet. I came to help you, Tella.

429
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:10,710
- OK. Calm down. - Fuck you!

430
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,880
I'm dying! I'm dying, sarge!

431
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:16,390
OK. Well, goddamn it, do it with less noise!

432
01:03:17,390 --> 01:03:20,220
- How you gonna get me out? - I'm gonna take you back.

433
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,310
- Come on. - No!

434
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:27,980
Put me down! Put me down!

435
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:36,320
Leave me alone... Leave me alone.

436
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:38,780
Please, leave me alone.

437
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:49,290
Give me more. Give me more.

438
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,170
Give me more. Give me more.

439
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:54,420
Give me more. Give me more.

440
01:03:57,550 --> 01:03:58,800
Here, Tella.

441
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:10,190
Goodbye... goodbye.

442
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,150
Bye, kid.

443
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:18,240
Goodbye, sarge. Goodbye.

444
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:38,470
Fortunately, Jim, the fate of the company doesn't depend on one man.

445
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:46,430
Sergeant, I saw the whole thing through the glasses.

446
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:50,770
I'm gonna mention you in orders tomorrow and recommend you for the Silver Star.

447
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:53,480
- It's the most courageous thing... - Captain,

448
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:57,780
you say one more word to thank me, I'll knock you right in the teeth.

449
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:01,570
You mention me in your fuckin' orders, and I'll resign so fast

450
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:05,700
and leave you here to run this busted-up outfit by yourself.

451
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:09,040
You understand?

452
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:13,500
Property! Whole fuckin' thing's about property.

453
01:05:28,430 --> 01:05:32,730
What's the matter with you, Staros? Those men should be reinforced immediately!

454
01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:35,650
What are they doing? I can see 'em through my glasses.

455
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:37,820
They're lying behind that ledge!

456
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:41,450
They should be up and out, cleaning out those machine guns! Over!

457
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:44,450
I don't think you understand what's going on, sir.

458
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:47,410
We've had... heavy casualties.

459
01:05:47,490 --> 01:05:52,370
We had a man... His gut got shot out on the slopes, sir. Created quite an upset.

460
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:55,630
Fine, fine. Now, what about those reinforcements? Over.

461
01:05:55,710 --> 01:06:01,550
I have two squads to First Platoon I can send up, sir. Over.

462
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:04,050
What the hell do you mean, two squads?!

463
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:07,600
Goddamn you, Staros! When I say reinforcements,

464
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:12,440
goddamn it, I mean it! You commit everybody you have there and do it now!

465
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:16,520
Your First Platoon, too. I see 'em lying on their fat asses doing nothing.

466
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:21,650
Get a man to 'em right now with orders to attack, and move 'em by the flank to the ridge.

467
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:24,530
Then get that Second Platoon over to the hill!

468
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:27,870
Have 'em press the centre. Go straight up that goddamn hill!

469
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:29,620
Attack them right now!

470
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:33,500
Jesus, Staros! Do i have to give you a lesson on infantry tactics

471
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:36,210
while your men are getting their asses shot off?.

472
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:40,050
Colonel, I don't think you fully understand what is going on here.

473
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:43,340
My company alone cannot take that position, sir.

474
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:46,930
The Japs are too well dug in. They've got too much fire power.

475
01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:49,100
Colonel, there's a bunker up there.

476
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:52,560
We can't see it, and it's... it's chewing my men to pieces, sir.

477
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:59,320
I request permission for patrol reconnaissance around

478
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:03,030
to the right of Hill 210. I believe the entire position, sir,

479
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:05,740
can be outflanked with a manoeuvre there in force.

480
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:08,120
- No! Goddamn it, no! - Might save lives!

481
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,080
There'll be no flanking move.

482
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,000
Listen, Staros. You're not gonna take your men

483
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:16,540
around into the jungle to avoid a goddamn fight!

484
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:22,170
Do you hear me, Staros? I want you to attack right now with every man at your disposal!

485
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:25,130
Now, attack, Staros! That's a direct order!

486
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:37,480
Sir, I must tell you that I refuse to obey your order.

487
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:55,910
- There it is, right there. See it? - I don't see it.

488
01:07:56,670 --> 01:07:59,460
This is not your fault, Jim. He's ordering you to.

489
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:08,470
I again request permission for patrol reconnaissance around to the right in force.

490
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:13,430
The time, sir,... is 1321 hours, 25 seconds.

491
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:18,520
I have two witnesses here. I request that you do the same with witnesses there. Over.

492
01:08:23,690 --> 01:08:27,240
Staros, don't pull this guardhouse-lawyer bullshit with me!

493
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:31,450
Now, I know you're a goddamn lawyer! This is not a court of law.

494
01:08:31,530 --> 01:08:33,790
This is a war. It's a goddamn battle!

495
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:38,750
Now, I want that frontal attack. I repeat my order. Over.

496
01:08:38,830 --> 01:08:42,500
Colonel, I refuse to take my men up there in a frontal attack.

497
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:44,760
It's suicide, sir.

498
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:50,010
I've lived with these men for two years, and I will not order them all to their deaths. Over.

499
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:01,610
This is a very important decision, Staros.

500
01:09:05,190 --> 01:09:09,030
But if you feel that strongly, maybe you have a reason, so I'm coming down.

501
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:11,490
Go take a look.

502
01:09:11,570 --> 01:09:14,280
I'm not rescinding my order to you, son,

503
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:19,210
but if I find extenuating circumstances when I get there, I'll take that into account.

504
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:23,590
Now, in the meantime, goddamn it, I want you to hold on until I get there.

505
01:09:23,670 --> 01:09:27,880
And, if possible, you get those men on the ridge out and moving! Out.

506
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:43,730
One spot's as good as another, men.

507
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:45,900
There's no place to hide.

508
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:54,910
Just take it easy, son. Take it easy. Take it easy.

509
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:58,370
Where's... where's Fife?

510
01:09:58,450 --> 01:10:00,660
Fife? He's right here, son. Fife.

511
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:03,380
Hold my hand, Fife.

512
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:06,380
Hold my hand.

513
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:13,550
I got it.

514
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:19,640
I'm dying, Fife.

515
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:48,840
Oh, Captain...

516
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:40,220
Shut up in a tomb.

517
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:44,480
Can't lift the lid.

518
01:11:46,730 --> 01:11:49,020
Played a role I never conceived.

519
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:53,320
Get that blouse on, soldier. It's not a goddamn bathing beach!

520
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,070
Put it on right now.

521
01:11:55,150 --> 01:11:58,530
What you aiming at, son? Let's go get those son of a bitches.

522
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:00,700
Move up!

523
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:14,210
What are you doing laying down there where you can't see a damn thing?

524
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:23,100
Observing, sir. Just sent First Platoon forward to the ridge.

525
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:26,810
- How many of 'em were hit this time? - None, sir.

526
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:28,980
None? Not one?

527
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:33,940
Doesn't sound like the situation you described to me over the sound power.

528
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:38,610
Well, it's not. The situation's changed just in the last five minutes, sir.

529
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:44,240
Captain, you listen to me.

530
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:46,960
We're going over there and taking everybody with us.

531
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,540
Do you have any more complaints or demurrers?

532
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:54,300
- No, sir. Not now. - All right! We're gonna do things my way!

533
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:56,800
My way! You understand that, Captain?

534
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:01,180
We're taking everybody over to that ledge! We may take that ridge by nightfall!

535
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:05,140
I think the ridge is quite a way from being reduced, sir.

536
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:14,820
Show me how to see things the way you do.

537
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:20,360
Show me how to see things the way you do.

538
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:26,830
We're just dirt. We're just dirt.

539
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:52,940
We're gonna get killed if we stay here.

540
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:56,270
Bell, take six men

541
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:58,440
and go see what's up there.

542
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:06,870
And we'll cover you the best we can from down there.

543
01:15:26,610 --> 01:15:28,070
OK.

544
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:30,660
You guys, you guys, stay here. OK?

545
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:33,870
I'm going alone.

546
01:17:13,470 --> 01:17:15,560
Come out.

547
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:22,980
Come out where lam.

548
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:34,220
There was a... There was a...

549
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:38,220
There's a bunker... up there.

550
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:42,140
It's five guns.

551
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,770
It's five guns.

552
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:54,070
That strongpoint up there, somewhere up there around those rocks,

553
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,240
is the key to this ridge.

554
01:18:59,330 --> 01:19:01,450
Bell here is quite right.

555
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:07,250
From their knob up there, those little brown brothers can cover the whole of the ground

556
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:11,670
in front of this position for 1,000 yards. They've left this ledge unguarded.

557
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:15,720
Now, goddamn it, that's a mistake. That's a hell of a mistake.

558
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:19,970
We need to take advantage of it before they see their error.

559
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:25,850
All right, all right, I know you're all pretty exhausted,

560
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:29,400
and we've had a hell of a time getting water up here.

561
01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:33,190
For that I'm sorry. I apologise to you all.

562
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:38,990
But if we can reduce this bunker tomorrow, I think we can take this ridge.

563
01:19:41,830 --> 01:19:44,160
So I'm asking for volunteers.

564
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:46,500
Go back up there and knock it out.

565
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:48,670
Sir?

566
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:50,840
I'll be glad to go back up

567
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:53,260
- and lead the way back for a party. - Right.

568
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:55,050
- I'll go, sir. - You.

569
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,260
All right.

570
01:19:57,340 --> 01:20:02,180
- I'd like to lead the party, Colonel. - All right, John. I was hoping you'd say that.

571
01:20:02,270 --> 01:20:05,180
- You'll be in command. - I'll go, sir.

572
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:06,640
- Sir? - You.

573
01:20:06,730 --> 01:20:10,730
All right, men, that's enough. Seven is plenty. Gather up.

574
01:20:14,530 --> 01:20:19,030
I don't know if you realise the importance of this operation, Staros.

575
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:23,620
Once our position is secured, we can move the bombers in.

576
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:27,670
That means air power for 1,000 miles in every direction.

577
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:32,210
Guadalcanal may be the turning point in the war.

578
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:36,920
- It'll cost lives. Is that what's troubling you? - No, sir.

579
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:43,060
I explained to you the importance of this objective.

580
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:46,350
How many men do you think it's worth? How many lives?

581
01:20:46,430 --> 01:20:48,520
I can't say, sir.

582
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:59,660
Are you prepared to sacrifice the lives of any of your men in this campaign?

583
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:04,240
How many? One? Two?

584
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,890
Twenty?

585
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:11,430
Lives will be lost in your company, Captain.

586
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:17,190
And if you don't have the stomach for it, now is the time to let me know.

587
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:21,980
No, sir. You're right... about everything you said.

588
01:21:22,070 --> 01:21:24,150
Fine, fine.

589
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:26,320
That's all, Captain.

590
01:21:28,030 --> 01:21:30,120
One more thing, Staros.

591
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:35,160
It's not necessary for you to ever tell me that you think I'm right.

592
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:37,420
Ever.

593
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,840
We'll assume it.

594
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:41,800
Dismissed.

595
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:00,690
I feel sorry for you, kid.

596
01:22:02,070 --> 01:22:04,150
- Yeah? - Yeah, a little.

597
01:22:07,610 --> 01:22:09,700
This army's gonna kill you.

598
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:19,170
If you were smart, you'd take care of yourself. There's nothing you can do for anybody else.

599
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:23,420
You're just running into a burning house where nobody can be saved.

600
01:22:36,270 --> 01:22:41,110
What difference do you think you can make? One single man in all this madness.

601
01:22:46,650 --> 01:22:49,070
If you die, it's gonna be for nothing.

602
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:57,870
There's not some other world out there where everything's gonna be OK.

603
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:00,040
There's just this one.

604
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:04,040
Just this rock.

605
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,500
Go ahead! Come on, come on.

606
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:46,710
Who's deciding who's gonna live?

607
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:49,510
Who's deciding who's gonna die?

608
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:53,470
This is futile!

609
01:23:54,930 --> 01:24:00,020
Look at me! I stand right up here and not one bullet.

610
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:02,190
Not one shot!

611
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:04,980
Why?

612
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:07,360
How come they all had to die?

613
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:11,900
I can stand right here, I can stand right up and nothing happens to me!

614
01:24:32,420 --> 01:24:34,510
We.

615
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:43,140
We together.

616
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:55,950
One being.

617
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:13,260
Flow together like water,

618
01:25:16,550 --> 01:25:18,850
till I can't tell you from me.

619
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:38,820
I drink you.

620
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:42,950
Now.

621
01:25:45,290 --> 01:25:47,370
Now.

622
01:26:23,990 --> 01:26:26,080
You're my light.

623
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:31,420
My guide.

624
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:43,950
John, I'll be behind you. If you wanna break through, we'll come after.

625
01:27:44,030 --> 01:27:46,580
We'll charge at your whistle signal.

626
01:27:47,330 --> 01:27:49,830
All right, let's go, men. Go get 'em.

627
01:29:44,150 --> 01:29:46,240
OK.

628
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:49,910
Stay down, below this ledge,

629
01:29:49,990 --> 01:29:54,000
and I'll call down the data from above.

630
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:58,670
Once the 81s have plastered that rock... as much as possible,

631
01:29:58,750 --> 01:30:02,550
we're gonna crawl out along that big rock for cover

632
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:06,130
and then flank 'em to the right.

633
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:08,090
OK?

634
01:30:09,590 --> 01:30:12,180
OK. OK.

635
01:30:32,870 --> 01:30:37,460
Azimuth 1470... from Easy Roger 7.

636
01:30:38,330 --> 01:30:40,670
100 left, add 200.

637
01:30:40,750 --> 01:30:43,420
Uncle Baker 1, fire mission.

638
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:46,550
Azimuth 1470 from Easy Roger 7.

639
01:30:46,630 --> 01:30:49,840
Left 100, add 200.

640
01:30:50,510 --> 01:30:53,810
Machine gun. Will adjust. Over.

641
01:30:53,890 --> 01:30:56,640
Understand. 1470 from EasyRoger 7.

642
01:31:11,030 --> 01:31:13,120
Left 25, drop 50!

643
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:16,370
Left 25, Uncle Baker 1.

644
01:31:16,450 --> 01:31:18,750
Left 25, drop 50.

645
01:31:18,830 --> 01:31:20,920
Fire for effect. Over.

646
01:31:21,170 --> 01:31:23,250
Roger, Uncle Baker 1.

647
01:31:45,610 --> 01:31:47,280
Let's go!

648
01:32:02,710 --> 01:32:06,130
OK, we're gonna continue on up the hill to the right.

649
01:32:06,210 --> 01:32:10,470
Nobody fire or throw the grenades till I give the signal.

650
01:32:10,550 --> 01:32:12,630
OK, let's do it.

651
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:30,240
Is he OK? ls he all right?

652
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:32,700
What we gonna do? Can't take him with us.

653
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:36,830
- No, we can't leave him here. - He's from your platoon. You stay with him.

654
01:32:36,910 --> 01:32:40,910
We can leave him and pick him up on the way back,... if he's still alive.

655
01:32:44,790 --> 01:32:47,210
- Is he dead? - Not yet.

656
01:32:47,290 --> 01:32:50,880
Dale, stay with him! Cover our flank! Move!

657
01:33:15,610 --> 01:33:16,700
Behind you!

658
01:33:32,130 --> 01:33:34,220
We're pinned down!

659
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:06,250
Fall back!

660
01:34:11,210 --> 01:34:12,670
Go!

661
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:25,870
Watch out.

662
01:36:04,490 --> 01:36:05,950
Clear!

663
01:36:58,170 --> 01:37:00,260
Come on. Get out.

664
01:37:01,630 --> 01:37:03,720
Go on.

665
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:08,810
Think you're soldiers?

666
01:37:15,810 --> 01:37:18,060
You piece of shit!

667
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,200
Son of a bitch!

668
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:28,370
Son of a bitch!

669
01:37:47,390 --> 01:37:49,470
All right?

670
01:37:52,220 --> 01:37:54,310
I shot a man.

671
01:38:29,550 --> 01:38:31,640
Stinks around here.

672
01:38:32,850 --> 01:38:36,390
- All these dead people. - Put a cigarette up your nose.

673
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:00,980
Look at 'em move!

674
01:40:01,060 --> 01:40:02,810
Look at 'em move!

675
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:04,770
We got 'em on the run!

676
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:08,070
Way to go, John. When they saw you make that attack and win,

677
01:40:08,150 --> 01:40:10,700
you put their hearts back into them.

678
01:40:10,780 --> 01:40:12,990
- Hey, hey! - Don't do that, soldier.

679
01:40:13,070 --> 01:40:17,910
Take care of the others. G-2 will want them. There'll be somebody around before long.

680
01:40:17,990 --> 01:40:20,460
We've wasted enough time here. Let's go.

681
01:40:20,540 --> 01:40:23,290
Sir, I've a few recommendations for decorations.

682
01:40:23,370 --> 01:40:26,920
Yes. We'll get everything for all of 'em that we can, but later.

683
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:31,470
Meantime, I want you to know I'm personally recommending you for something, John.

684
01:40:31,550 --> 01:40:33,010
Perhaps the big one.

685
01:40:33,090 --> 01:40:36,180
- Thank you, sir, but I don't feel... - Yes, you do, John.

686
01:40:36,260 --> 01:40:39,100
Getting it for you will be the goddamn problem!

687
01:40:39,180 --> 01:40:43,600
But, hell, it'd be a big thing for the battalion and the regiment, if you did get it.

688
01:40:43,690 --> 01:40:45,350
We better move out.

689
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:49,980
We need to extend our lines, hook up with the other companies and push on to the top.

690
01:40:50,070 --> 01:40:53,030
Would you like to take command of Baker Company?

691
01:40:53,110 --> 01:40:54,160
Of course.

692
01:40:54,240 --> 01:40:58,870
Sir, I don't mean to be a wet blanket, but about the water. If we don't get water...

693
01:40:58,950 --> 01:41:01,040
Don't worry about water.

694
01:41:02,540 --> 01:41:07,790
John, I don't want anything to break up this attack of ours now we have the momentum.

695
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:11,420
We'll have some water in a... couple of hours.

696
01:41:11,510 --> 01:41:13,590
I've arranged for that.

697
01:41:14,220 --> 01:41:17,720
Now, we just can't stop now, goddamn it, and wait for it.

698
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,680
No, sir.

699
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:21,970
That's right.

700
01:41:22,060 --> 01:41:27,860
And if some of the men... pass out, why, hell, they'll just have to pass out.

701
01:41:31,650 --> 01:41:33,530
All right.

702
01:41:33,610 --> 01:41:35,070
They could...

703
01:41:35,150 --> 01:41:38,490
They could die from it.They could die from enemy fire, too!

704
01:41:39,830 --> 01:41:42,120
They're all tough boys.

705
01:41:46,870 --> 01:41:52,000
Come on, men, let's go! You'll see plenty more of those where we're going!

706
01:41:52,090 --> 01:41:54,670
Are we going up this hill or aren't we?

707
01:41:58,550 --> 01:42:02,520
John, I'm convinced that the Japanese position can be broken now.

708
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:07,690
All we have to do is keep going and we'll have this hill. We'll have this hill by sundown.

709
01:42:07,770 --> 01:42:10,770
You see the spirit in these men? D'you see the new spirit?

710
01:42:10,860 --> 01:42:16,030
Well, I want to take advantage of that before something happens to sap their strength.

711
01:42:16,110 --> 01:42:18,990
To have this battalion relieved in a defeat,

712
01:42:19,070 --> 01:42:22,530
or even to have it reinforced from troops

713
01:42:22,530 --> 01:42:26,000
from the reserves,if we were to stall before reaching the top, well,

714
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:30,330
Jesus Christ, that's just a hell of a lot more than I could stand!

715
01:42:30,420 --> 01:42:32,800
I've waited all my life for this.

716
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:37,430
I've worked, slaved, eaten... oh, untold buckets of shit to have this opportunity!

717
01:42:37,510 --> 01:42:39,970
And I don't intend to give it up now.

718
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:46,810
You don't know what it feels like to be passed over.

719
01:42:46,890 --> 01:42:50,060
I mean, you're young. You're just out of the Academy.

720
01:42:50,150 --> 01:42:55,820
You're, you know, you've got your war! This 15 years, this is my first war!

721
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:04,620
John, some day you'll understand.

722
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:12,590
You're like a son to me, John.

723
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:17,050
You know what my son does?

724
01:43:17,970 --> 01:43:20,050
He's a bait salesman.

725
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:24,720
You've done a hell of a job, John.

726
01:43:24,810 --> 01:43:29,690
I'm gonna make sure that you get everything, everything that you deserve.

727
01:43:31,940 --> 01:43:34,020
Thank you, sir.

728
01:43:36,110 --> 01:43:38,190
God...

729
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:41,740
Goddamn it! I want three runners!

730
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:43,490
Get me three runners!

731
01:43:43,570 --> 01:43:45,830
You go back to the rear to find water

732
01:43:45,910 --> 01:43:48,790
and get back here with it as fast as you can!

733
01:43:49,710 --> 01:43:52,920
We attack in one hour! We'll throw everything we got at 'em.

734
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,500
We're going all the way! Nothing'll stop us.

735
01:43:55,590 --> 01:43:57,670
It's high ground by nightfall!

736
01:44:21,820 --> 01:44:24,370
You seen many dead people?

737
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:27,120
Plenty.

738
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:29,830
They're no different than dead dogs,

739
01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:32,620
once you get used to the idea.

740
01:44:37,460 --> 01:44:39,550
They're meat, kid.

741
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:58,570
Are you righteous? Kind?

742
01:45:01,650 --> 01:45:03,820
Does your confidence lie in this?

743
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:09,330
Are you loved by all?

744
01:45:11,620 --> 01:45:13,710
Know that I was, too.

745
01:45:17,290 --> 01:45:21,960
Do you imagine your sufferings will be less because you loved goodness?

746
01:45:22,590 --> 01:45:24,680
Truth?

747
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:26,250
Get fucking on the ground! Get down! Get down!

748
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,090
Get down. Stay there.

749
01:49:37,550 --> 01:49:41,430
Get on the ground! Get on the fucking ground!

750
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:43,390
Now!

751
01:50:42,920 --> 01:50:45,000
This great evil.

752
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:49,840
Where's it come from?

753
01:50:54,510 --> 01:50:56,600
How'd it steal into the world?

754
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:11,910
What seed, what root did it grow from?

755
01:51:16,830 --> 01:51:18,910
Who's doing this?

756
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:23,580
Who's killing us?

757
01:51:27,550 --> 01:51:30,050
Robbing us of life and light.

758
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:38,220
Mocking us with the sight of what we might have known.

759
01:52:04,210 --> 01:52:06,920
Does our ruin benefit the Earth?

760
01:52:09,300 --> 01:52:12,930
Does it help the grass to grow or the sun to shine?

761
01:52:19,100 --> 01:52:21,390
Is this darkness in you, too?

762
01:52:27,860 --> 01:52:30,190
Have you passed through this night?

763
01:52:36,410 --> 01:52:38,950
I'm gonna sink my teeth into your liver.

764
01:52:42,660 --> 01:52:44,750
You're dying.

765
01:52:56,680 --> 01:52:58,800
See them birds up there?

766
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:02,850
You know they eat you raw?

767
01:53:07,770 --> 01:53:10,940
Where you're going, you're not coming back from.

768
01:54:22,430 --> 01:54:24,520
What are you to me?

769
01:54:30,310 --> 01:54:32,400
Nothing.

770
01:56:53,620 --> 01:56:55,710
Have a seat here.

771
01:57:05,970 --> 01:57:08,760
Staros, I'm relieving you of your command.

772
01:57:12,140 --> 01:57:14,520
Lieutenant Band will take over for you.

773
01:57:16,230 --> 01:57:18,310
I already told him.

774
01:57:28,700 --> 01:57:30,990
It's a hard thing to do.

775
01:57:31,790 --> 01:57:33,870
Difficult decision to make.

776
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,170
I don't think you're tough enough.

777
01:57:40,670 --> 01:57:45,670
You're too soft. You're just too soft-hearted. You're not tough-fibred enough.

778
01:57:50,220 --> 01:57:54,180
Anyway, it's my decision to make. I've already made it.

779
01:57:54,890 --> 01:57:57,390
I don't like to see my men get killed, sir.

780
01:58:05,650 --> 01:58:08,860
Have you ever had anyone die in your arms, sir?

781
01:58:08,950 --> 01:58:11,240
Have you?

782
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:26,840
I don't see any reason to make a scandal out of this.

783
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:32,350
I don't want it in the records of the battalion. There's no reason for you to have it on yours.

784
01:58:32,430 --> 01:58:36,020
This has nothing to do with cowardice or inefficiency.

785
01:58:39,310 --> 01:58:41,610
Look at this jungle.

786
01:58:41,690 --> 01:58:47,030
Look at those vines, the way they twine around the trees, swallowing everything.

787
01:58:49,450 --> 01:58:51,740
Nature's cruel, Staros.

788
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:06,550
I'm going to let you apply for reassignment to the Judge Advocate General Corps

789
01:59:06,630 --> 01:59:08,510
for reasons of ill health.

790
01:59:08,590 --> 01:59:09,970
You're a lawyer.

791
01:59:10,050 --> 01:59:12,430
- You had malaria yet? - No, I haven't.

792
01:59:12,510 --> 01:59:14,890
Doesn't matter. I can fix that.

793
01:59:14,970 --> 01:59:17,220
Anyway, you probably will have it.

794
01:59:17,890 --> 01:59:20,980
I'm also recommending you for the Silver Star.

795
01:59:21,060 --> 01:59:25,230
And I'll recommend it in such a way it definitely won't be refused.

796
01:59:26,150 --> 01:59:28,780
Might as well have the Purple Heart, too.

797
01:59:31,450 --> 01:59:33,120
Why?

798
01:59:33,200 --> 01:59:38,830
Because of that scratch on your face and because of those cuts on your hands.

799
01:59:38,910 --> 01:59:40,580
Listen to me, Staros.

800
01:59:40,660 --> 01:59:44,710
I think it's best you go back with the next batch of wounded and prisoners.

801
01:59:44,790 --> 01:59:48,590
It is no goddamn good for you to keep hanging around.

802
01:59:48,670 --> 01:59:52,220
The quieter we keep this, the better it'll be for all.

803
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:29,130
This is from Colonel Tall.

804
02:00:30,630 --> 02:00:34,130
"Our victory gives us the highest reasons for pride".

805
02:00:35,220 --> 02:00:38,760
"It will prove a milestone in the battle for Guadalcanal".

806
02:00:40,100 --> 02:00:45,100
"Tomorrow the division commander will arrive to make an inspection of the line".

807
02:00:45,190 --> 02:00:50,440
"After the inspection we're to be relieved by a battalion of the division's reserve regiment".

808
02:00:51,900 --> 02:00:56,160
"I've secured for the battalion a week's rest off the line".

809
02:01:00,410 --> 02:01:01,870
That's all.

810
02:02:57,320 --> 02:02:59,400
Hours like months.

811
02:03:02,160 --> 02:03:04,240
Days like years.

812
02:03:07,580 --> 02:03:09,660
Walked into the golden age.

813
02:03:13,630 --> 02:03:16,210
Stood on the shores of the New World.

814
02:03:27,140 --> 02:03:30,100
I would've come by and paid you guys a visit,

815
02:03:30,190 --> 02:03:31,850
but...

816
02:03:34,980 --> 02:03:37,610
I just felt like being alone, you know?

817
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:41,490
Yeah?

818
02:03:51,670 --> 02:03:53,750
We wanted to thank you, sir.

819
02:03:57,800 --> 02:04:00,300
For asking to make that flanking move.

820
02:04:02,380 --> 02:04:04,470
For watching out for us.

821
02:04:06,510 --> 02:04:08,600
Keeping us together.

822
02:04:13,770 --> 02:04:15,860
We're all sorry to see you go.

823
02:04:15,940 --> 02:04:18,110
We feel like you got a rotten deal.

824
02:04:20,360 --> 02:04:23,530
Well, I'm not sure that you're right.

825
02:04:26,280 --> 02:04:28,160
Tough part is...

826
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:32,540
not knowing if you're doing any good.

827
02:04:34,420 --> 02:04:36,500
That's the hard part.

828
02:04:38,250 --> 02:04:40,880
But it doesn't matter. I don't care.

829
02:04:41,720 --> 02:04:43,800
I'm glad to be going.

830
02:04:45,050 --> 02:04:47,010
I'm glad.

831
02:04:47,100 --> 02:04:50,890
- There's still time. We could file a complaint. - For what?

832
02:04:51,980 --> 02:04:54,230
What good would that do?

833
02:04:55,940 --> 02:04:57,610
Anyway, I wanna go.

834
02:05:00,530 --> 02:05:02,990
Leave it alone. Let it lay.

835
02:05:15,580 --> 02:05:17,670
What does that mean, sir?

836
02:05:20,380 --> 02:05:22,710
It means "You've been like my sons".

837
02:05:33,980 --> 02:05:36,060
You are my sons.

838
02:05:37,310 --> 02:05:39,400
My dear sons.

839
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:45,400
You live inside me now.

840
02:05:49,410 --> 02:05:51,490
I'll carry you wherever I go.

841
02:06:07,510 --> 02:06:10,300
Can't nothing make you forget it.

842
02:06:14,020 --> 02:06:16,520
Each time you start from scratch.

843
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:24,940
War don't ennoble men.

844
02:06:25,990 --> 02:06:28,280
It turns 'em into dogs.

845
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:36,160
Poisons the soul.

846
02:07:40,140 --> 02:07:42,230
My dear wife,

847
02:07:44,980 --> 02:07:51,570
you get something twisted out of your insides by all this blood, filth, and noise.

848
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:03,670
I wanna stay changeless for you.

849
02:08:06,250 --> 02:08:09,260
I wanna come back to you the man I was before.

850
02:08:17,260 --> 02:08:19,970
How do we get to those other shores?

851
02:08:23,810 --> 02:08:25,900
To those blue hills.

852
02:08:36,120 --> 02:08:37,780
Love.

853
02:08:47,340 --> 02:08:49,420
Where does it come from?

854
02:08:57,890 --> 02:08:59,970
Who lit this flame in us?

855
02:09:07,020 --> 02:09:09,110
No war can put it out,

856
02:09:10,610 --> 02:09:12,690
conquer it.

857
02:09:20,540 --> 02:09:22,620
I was a prisoner.

858
02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:29,170
You set me free.

859
02:09:33,300 --> 02:09:35,840
No matter how much training you got,

860
02:09:36,970 --> 02:09:39,050
how careful you are,

861
02:09:40,430 --> 02:09:43,890
it's a matter of luck whether or not you get killed.

862
02:09:43,980 --> 02:09:49,230
Makes no difference who you are, or how tough a guy you might be,

863
02:09:51,270 --> 02:09:55,700
if you're in the wrong spot at the wrong time, you're gonna get it.

864
02:10:06,410 --> 02:10:08,880
I look at that boy dying,

865
02:10:10,380 --> 02:10:12,460
I don't feel nothing.

866
02:10:15,720 --> 02:10:18,380
I don't care about nothing any more.

867
02:10:23,060 --> 02:10:25,140
Sounds like bliss.

868
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:31,690
I don't have that feeling yet.

869
02:10:33,110 --> 02:10:35,190
That numbness.

870
02:10:36,240 --> 02:10:38,320
Not like the rest of you guys.

871
02:10:42,660 --> 02:10:44,950
Maybe cos I knew what to expect.

872
02:10:48,160 --> 02:10:50,420
Maybe I was just frozen up already.

873
02:11:34,210 --> 02:11:37,710
I haven't touched another woman since I was called up.

874
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:40,880
Or talked to one.

875
02:11:44,890 --> 02:11:46,970
I don't wanna...

876
02:11:47,680 --> 02:11:50,230
I don't wanna feel the desire.

877
02:12:27,350 --> 02:12:29,020
All right. Abrahams!

878
02:12:29,100 --> 02:12:30,770
Abrahams. Here you go.

879
02:12:30,850 --> 02:12:32,730
Stack! Where's Stack?

880
02:12:32,810 --> 02:12:34,850
Bring him out.

881
02:12:34,940 --> 02:12:37,020
Bell?

882
02:12:37,110 --> 02:12:38,980
Bell!

883
02:12:40,030 --> 02:12:42,530
Another one for Bell. Another one for Bell.

884
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:47,370
Dear Jack,

885
02:12:49,160 --> 02:12:54,330
I've met an Air Force captain. I've fallen in love with him.

886
02:12:57,040 --> 02:12:59,340
I want a divorce to marry him.

887
02:13:05,680 --> 02:13:09,260
I know you can say no, but I'm asking you anyway,

888
02:13:09,350 --> 02:13:12,140
out of the memory of what we had together.

889
02:13:18,900 --> 02:13:20,980
Forgive me.

890
02:13:21,940 --> 02:13:24,530
It just got too lonely, Jack.

891
02:13:44,840 --> 02:13:46,930
We'll meet again some day.

892
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:54,680
People who have been as close as we've been always meet again.

893
02:14:03,150 --> 02:14:05,990
I have no right to speak to you this way.

894
02:14:06,070 --> 02:14:08,360
I can't stop myself.

895
02:14:08,870 --> 02:14:10,950
A habit so strong.

896
02:14:13,120 --> 02:14:15,750
Oh, my friend of all those shining years.

897
02:14:19,880 --> 02:14:21,960
Help me leave you!

898
02:15:49,060 --> 02:15:51,140
What's your name?

899
02:17:03,170 --> 02:17:05,260
We were a family.

900
02:17:08,510 --> 02:17:11,100
How'd it break up and come apart?

901
02:17:14,350 --> 02:17:17,850
So that now we're turned against each other.

902
02:17:19,730 --> 02:17:22,320
Each standing in the other's light.

903
02:17:31,530 --> 02:17:34,160
How did we lose the good that was given us?

904
02:17:35,960 --> 02:17:38,040
Let it slip away?

905
02:17:40,840 --> 02:17:42,920
Scatter it careless?

906
02:18:03,610 --> 02:18:06,030
What's keeping us from reaching out?

907
02:18:06,650 --> 02:18:08,740
Touching the glory?

908
02:18:10,780 --> 02:18:16,700
I'd have had you, Witt, if you was a Jap,Long ago.

909
02:18:18,290 --> 02:18:20,370
They leave you here?

910
02:18:21,920 --> 02:18:23,420
Yup.

911
02:18:23,500 --> 02:18:25,590
I slowed 'em up.

912
02:18:26,260 --> 02:18:28,170
Don't mind, really.

913
02:18:29,180 --> 02:18:31,970
The medic fixed me up pretty good.

914
02:18:32,090 --> 02:18:34,180
I got plenty of ammo.

915
02:18:36,850 --> 02:18:39,480
Somebody'll be along for me eventually.

916
02:18:44,570 --> 02:18:46,860
- They got you good. - Right in the knee.

917
02:18:46,940 --> 02:18:48,650
Yeah.

918
02:18:48,740 --> 02:18:51,320
I'm out of this war for good, Witt.

919
02:18:56,620 --> 02:19:00,210
- What you doin' down here? - Just, you know,

920
02:19:00,290 --> 02:19:02,580
I'm heading back to the company.

921
02:19:03,250 --> 02:19:04,920
Yeah.

922
02:19:05,750 --> 02:19:08,050
Well, you give all them boys my best.

923
02:19:08,130 --> 02:19:10,590
You can come with me if you want.

924
02:19:10,680 --> 02:19:12,800
I'll help you along.

925
02:19:14,430 --> 02:19:17,010
No, it's nice and quiet.

926
02:19:17,100 --> 02:19:19,180
Peaceful up here.

927
02:19:21,560 --> 02:19:24,730
I'd just slow you up. There'll be somebody along.

928
02:19:28,610 --> 02:19:30,700
I'll remind 'em.

929
02:19:31,150 --> 02:19:33,240
OK.

930
02:21:08,460 --> 02:21:10,540
Hey, Witt.

931
02:21:15,090 --> 02:21:17,260
Who you making trouble for today?

932
02:21:18,300 --> 02:21:20,390
What d'you mean?

933
02:21:21,140 --> 02:21:24,310
Well, isn't that what you like to do?

934
02:21:24,390 --> 02:21:27,060
Turn left when they say go right?

935
02:21:33,900 --> 02:21:36,400
Why are you such a troublemaker, Witt?

936
02:21:38,820 --> 02:21:41,370
You care about me, don't you, Sergeant?

937
02:21:42,740 --> 02:21:44,830
I always felt like you did.

938
02:21:46,660 --> 02:21:49,380
Why do you always make yourself out like a rock?

939
02:21:50,670 --> 02:21:53,050
One day I can come up and talk to you,

940
02:21:54,090 --> 02:21:57,970
by the next day it's like we never even met.

941
02:22:12,310 --> 02:22:14,400
Lonely house now.

942
02:22:17,070 --> 02:22:19,160
You ever get lonely?

943
02:22:19,240 --> 02:22:21,320
Only around people.

944
02:22:23,240 --> 02:22:25,330
Only around people.

945
02:22:29,960 --> 02:22:33,380
You still believing in the beautiful light, are you?

946
02:22:40,970 --> 02:22:43,050
How do you do that?

947
02:22:44,720 --> 02:22:46,810
You're a magician to me.

948
02:22:55,860 --> 02:22:57,940
I still see a spark in you.

949
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:28,540
One man looks at a dying bird and thinks there's nothing but unanswered pain.

950
02:23:31,250 --> 02:23:33,340
But death's got the final word.

951
02:23:36,430 --> 02:23:38,510
It's laughing at him.

952
02:23:47,810 --> 02:23:50,310
Another man sees that same bird,

953
02:23:53,230 --> 02:23:55,320
feels the glory.

954
02:24:00,370 --> 02:24:02,870
Feels something smiling through him.

955
02:25:00,220 --> 02:25:02,680
We need to get out of here right now.

956
02:25:02,760 --> 02:25:07,350
- You explain to... headquarters the situation? - No.

957
02:25:07,430 --> 02:25:11,520
Do they know where we are? Cos we're sitting ducks out here.

958
02:25:12,690 --> 02:25:16,230
Well, I think that's... up to me to judge, Sergeant.

959
02:25:17,860 --> 02:25:23,450
I think we just need to send somebody up there and find out how close they are. OK?

960
02:25:23,530 --> 02:25:25,410
It's easy.

961
02:25:25,490 --> 02:25:28,870
Hey, Weld... get headquarters on that thing.

962
02:25:28,950 --> 02:25:30,870
The fire's coming closer, sir.

963
02:25:30,960 --> 02:25:32,000
Line's cut!

964
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:39,170
We need to send somebody out there to find out where that line is being cut.

965
02:25:39,260 --> 02:25:41,880
And we need to find out how close they are.

966
02:25:41,970 --> 02:25:43,510
Come on.

967
02:25:43,590 --> 02:25:46,140
OK. OK.

968
02:25:50,270 --> 02:25:52,350
Hey, you.

969
02:25:52,980 --> 02:25:54,230
You go.

970
02:25:55,230 --> 02:25:56,900
You're going, Fife.

971
02:26:02,530 --> 02:26:05,530
Coombs. You go, too.

972
02:26:05,620 --> 02:26:07,280
Come on!

973
02:26:07,370 --> 02:26:11,910
I'll go. I want you to know I think the whole thing's a bad idea, though.

974
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:17,040
If they come down here in any strength, Lieutenant, they'll knock our position to hell.

975
02:26:17,130 --> 02:26:19,590
You don't have to go. Others'll volunteer.

976
02:26:19,670 --> 02:26:24,800
No, I wanna go, sir. In case something bad happens, I wanna be there.

977
02:26:24,890 --> 02:26:27,390
All right. You stay by the river.

978
02:26:27,470 --> 02:26:30,390
That jungle's too thick. And be very careful.

979
02:26:30,470 --> 02:26:32,560
I will.

980
02:26:32,640 --> 02:26:34,600
Good luck, Witt.

981
02:26:34,690 --> 02:26:36,810
You OK, Fife?

982
02:28:03,980 --> 02:28:06,610
A reinforce battalion.

983
02:28:08,200 --> 02:28:09,860
We need to go back.

984
02:28:09,950 --> 02:28:11,830
Tell the lieutenant.

985
02:28:15,620 --> 02:28:17,500
Let's go.

986
02:28:34,760 --> 02:28:36,850
I'm hit!

987
02:29:35,780 --> 02:29:38,580
One of us needs to stay here and hold 'em off.

988
02:29:45,710 --> 02:29:47,800
We'll be all right.

989
02:29:52,800 --> 02:29:55,800
My friend here doesn't have long,

990
02:29:55,890 --> 02:29:58,810
so... you go.

991
02:30:00,020 --> 02:30:01,480
You go on ahead.

992
02:30:24,710 --> 02:30:26,790
Witt!

993
02:31:12,630 --> 02:31:14,720
They're coming.

994
02:31:16,180 --> 02:31:19,510
I gotta go. I don't want you to be afraid.

995
02:31:20,260 --> 02:31:24,430
Just hide out here till you hear firing, then push on down the river.

996
02:31:24,520 --> 02:31:25,980
No.

997
02:32:06,230 --> 02:32:09,900
- Where's Coombs? - Get back. Get back, they're coming.

998
02:32:10,860 --> 02:32:12,940
Fall back.

999
02:32:14,440 --> 02:32:16,990
Where's Witt? Fife, where's Witt?

1000
02:32:23,200 --> 02:32:25,290
Fife, where's Witt?

1001
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:32,000
Fife. Fife, where's Witt?

1002
02:37:06,200 --> 02:37:08,280
Where's your spark now?

1003
02:37:31,050 --> 02:37:35,140
Now, I know you men have been making and drinking this goddamn swipe.

1004
02:37:35,220 --> 02:37:36,480
That's OK by me.

1005
02:37:36,560 --> 02:37:38,270
Everything a lie.

1006
02:37:38,350 --> 02:37:42,020
Any man in my outfit can get as drunk as he wants to every night.

1007
02:37:42,110 --> 02:37:44,230
Everything you hear and see.

1008
02:37:44,320 --> 02:37:48,490
As long as he's in shape to make reveille and carry out any assignment given.

1009
02:37:48,570 --> 02:37:52,450
If he can't do that, he's gonna have trouble from me.

1010
02:37:52,530 --> 02:37:56,370
- So much to spew out. - I prefer to think of myself as a family man,

1011
02:37:56,450 --> 02:37:59,670
and that's what we all are here, whether we like it or not.

1012
02:37:59,750 --> 02:38:01,830
We are a family.

1013
02:38:02,920 --> 02:38:05,090
I'm the father.

1014
02:38:05,760 --> 02:38:08,840
Guess that makes Sergeant Welsh here the mother.

1015
02:38:08,920 --> 02:38:11,640
They just keep coming, one after another.

1016
02:38:11,720 --> 02:38:15,010
That makes you all the children in this family.

1017
02:38:15,100 --> 02:38:18,640
Now, a family can have only one head, and that is the father.

1018
02:38:18,730 --> 02:38:23,400
Father's the head, mother runs it. That's the way it's gonna work here.

1019
02:38:23,480 --> 02:38:27,190
- If any of you wanna see me about anything, - You're in a box.

1020
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:29,400
- anything at all, - A moving box.

1021
02:38:29,490 --> 02:38:31,570
you will find that I am available.

1022
02:38:31,660 --> 02:38:34,620
This war is not gonna be over by next Christmas.

1023
02:38:34,700 --> 02:38:37,660
It's gonna be a long time before we get home...

1024
02:38:37,750 --> 02:38:39,830
They want you dead.

1025
02:38:42,210 --> 02:38:44,290
Or in their lie.

1026
02:38:49,510 --> 02:38:51,590
Only one thing a man can do.

1027
02:38:54,600 --> 02:38:56,680
Find something that's his.

1028
02:38:59,930 --> 02:39:02,020
Make an island for himself.

1029
02:39:15,490 --> 02:39:17,990
If I never meet you in this life,

1030
02:39:19,410 --> 02:39:21,500
Let me feel the lack.

1031
02:39:30,050 --> 02:39:34,470
A glance from your eyes, and my life will be yours.

1032
02:40:23,600 --> 02:40:27,650
Somethin' I can come back to. Some kind of foundation.

1033
02:40:27,810 --> 02:40:32,400
I mean, I don't know what, you know, what your plans are, but...

1034
02:40:32,490 --> 02:40:36,490
I'm determined now. I've been through the thick and thin of it.

1035
02:40:36,570 --> 02:40:39,910
You know, I may be young, but I've lived plenty of life.

1036
02:40:40,620 --> 02:40:42,870
I'm ready to start living it good.

1037
02:40:42,950 --> 02:40:47,920
You know, my daddy always told me it's gonna get a lot worse before it gets better.

1038
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:52,550
You know, cos life ain't supposed to be that hard when you're young.

1039
02:40:52,630 --> 02:40:56,300
Well, I figure after this the worst is gonna be gone.

1040
02:40:57,010 --> 02:41:00,600
It's time for things to get better. That's what I want.

1041
02:41:01,600 --> 02:41:03,680
That's what's gonna happen.

1042
02:41:04,810 --> 02:41:06,890
I'm getting older now.

1043
02:41:07,730 --> 02:41:10,230
By no means old, but older.

1044
02:41:11,020 --> 02:41:14,190
Where is it that we were together?

1045
02:41:17,360 --> 02:41:19,660
Who were you that I lived with?

1046
02:41:24,370 --> 02:41:26,460
Walked with?

1047
02:41:33,590 --> 02:41:35,670
The brother.

1048
02:41:42,180 --> 02:41:44,270
The friend.

1049
02:42:10,580 --> 02:42:12,670
Darkness from light.

1050
02:42:14,170 --> 02:42:16,260
Strife from love.

1051
02:42:17,420 --> 02:42:20,550
Are they the workings of one mind?

1052
02:42:21,930 --> 02:42:24,680
The features of the same face?

1053
02:42:39,570 --> 02:42:41,660
Oh, my soul,

1054
02:42:43,280 --> 02:42:45,370
Let me be in you now.

1055
02:42:51,420 --> 02:42:53,710
Look out through my eyes.

1056
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,500
Look out at the things you made.

1057
02:43:02,430 --> 02:43:04,720
All things shining.
