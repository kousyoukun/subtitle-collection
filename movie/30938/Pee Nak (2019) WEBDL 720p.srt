1
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,900
I would like to take the opportunity
to pay homage to the Gautama Buddha.

2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,190
I am begging you
to forgive me for all of my sins.

3
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:24,730
Please rejoice in my merit.

4
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,730
And you have made great merit,
please share it with me.

5
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:35,100
Sadhu. I rejoice in your merit.

6
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,270
Fuck.

7
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:50,730
Shit.

8
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,850
Help!

9
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,150
Help!

10
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,350
Help!

11
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:18,020
THUMMANAKANIMIT TEMPLE

12
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,560
Hurry up.

13
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,400
The last bus to Bangkae and Tha Phra

14
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,560
is about to leave.

15
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,900
You better hurry.

16
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,690
Wait for us.

17
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,060
-Wait for us.
-Let's go.

18
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,690
Oh, my god.

19
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,440
-What's with your hat?
-Please speed up.

20
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,480
Shit.

21
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,690
Tell me beforehand next time
if you will dress up like this.

22
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,810
Just think of it as a trip to Milan.

23
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,980
Oh, my god. What kind of ride is that?

24
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,100
Stop acting like a princess, First.

25
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,600
Hey.

26
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,020
It's cold up here.

27
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,350
It's so easy to breathe.

28
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
Balloon.

29
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,440
I'm glad that

30
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,350
you won the lottery. However,

31
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,230
did you give your boyfriend the car
to drive to Bangkok when I was asleep?

32
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,520
Just because he forgot to feed the dog?

33
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,770
Guys,

34
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,560
my boyfriend's dog is pitiful.

35
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,940
If it doesn't get to eat...

36
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,270
Hey.

37
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,730
Is your boyfriend's dog
more important than your friends?

38
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,100
I told you to rent a private car,
but you wouldn't listen.

39
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,810
Is the car under your boyfriend's name?

40
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,310
Did you transfer the ownership to him?

41
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,020
No. Are you crazy?

42
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,770
I would never transfer
the ownership to him.

43
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:35,980
You bitch.

44
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,350
You already did, didn't you?

45
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,850
What's wrong?

46
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,520
What's wrong? Calm down.

47
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,150
I'm sorry.

48
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,350
Her epilepsy is acting up.

49
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,400
He's so handsome.

50
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,150
Over there.

51
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,020
Leave it to me.

52
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,440
-Guys.
-What?

53
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,060
-How is he?
-He's handsome.

54
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,150
Hello. My name is Balloon.

55
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,900
-Right.
-Guys, come here quick.

56
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,350
-Pongsit!
-Pongsit!

57
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,560
Yes, it's me.

58
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,100
BANGKOK TO NAKHON PATHOM

59
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,690
-What?
-Keep walking straight.

60
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,060
Have a safe trip.

61
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,060
Guys.

62
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,440
Keep it down.

63
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,940
Guys, I miss the time
when we were in university.

64
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,270
Do you remember?
I hadn't seen you for a long time though.

65
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,400
How have you been?

66
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,480
I was fine at first
but now that I'm here with you--

67
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,650
You must feel even better now.

68
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,400
So, can you tell me

69
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,940
where you work now?

70
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,480
I just got fired.

71
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,310
People say it's because of my unlucky age,

72
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,150
but I think it's nonsense.

73
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:09,980
Your unlucky age?

74
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,400
Are you 25 years old now?

75
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,310
Yes, I turned 25 years old today.

76
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,810
Guys.

77
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,520
It's his birthday today.

78
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,020
One, two, three.

79
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,020
-Happy birthday to you
-Poon.

80
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,980
-Yes?
-Keep it down.

81
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,310
Please tell them to shut it.

82
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,850
-Okay.
-Happy birthday

83
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,850
-To you
-Hey.

84
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,310
Happy birthday...

85
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,980
-Stop.
-Happy birthday to you

86
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,480
-Poon.
-Stop already.

87
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,900
Don't go yet. Come here.

88
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,980
-What is it?
-Look at it. Do you see it?

89
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,560
Happy birthday to you

90
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,850
-Do you?
-I don't see anything.

91
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,400
-Happy birthday to you
-You don't? What are you looking at?

92
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,730
-Look in the mirror, not the road.
-Happy birthday to you

93
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,190
-The mirror.
-Happy birthday...

94
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,980
I don't see anything.

95
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,940
-Then, let's look at it together.
-Happy birthday to you

96
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,400
-Okay.
-Happy birthday to you

97
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,060
Oh, my god. The driver fainted.

98
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,230
-Oh, no.
-Oh, no.

99
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,730
Oh, no. What should we do?

100
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,150
Got, it has to be you.

101
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,850
-What should we do?
-You can drive it, Got.

102
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,350
-I can't.
-Pull yourself together.

103
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,520
Go right now.

104
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,020
Calm down. Got...

105
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,310
-Does he even know how to drive?
-Fuck. Eyes on the road.

106
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,440
Right.

107
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,650
Right.

108
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,520
I'm trying.

109
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,150
-Got.
-Balloon, help me drive this thing.

110
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,100
Guys, I don't want to die today.

111
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,810
BANGKOK TO NAKHON PATHOM

112
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,600
The patient is safe now.

113
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,770
Nong.

114
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,560
How do you feel, Nong?

115
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,770
Nong.

116
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,060
Got is dead.

117
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,850
Got.

118
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,400
Nong.

119
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,810
You can't say the accident
happened because of fate.

120
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,770
What about the people who died?

121
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,150
What did they have to do with it?

122
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,940
What about Balloon and First?

123
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,150
What did they do?

124
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,560
Why did this happen to them?

125
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,690
You can call me superstitious.

126
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,270
Or do you want to die like your friend?

127
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,850
So must I be ordained

128
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,230
to make my life better?

129
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,060
I won't get hit by a car
if I walk on the expressway.

130
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,310
I won't get burnt if I walk on fire.
Is that what you want?

131
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,400
Would I be a monk or an Avenger?

132
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,980
Nong.

133
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,650
Everyone.

134
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,730
Wait for me in there.

135
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,350
Did you see the person
who just went inside?

136
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,520
You know,

137
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,850
he isn't half

138
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
as lucky as you

139
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,310
because his parents

140
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,480
passed away before he could be ordained.

141
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,310
He has nothing to do with me.

142
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,730
I don't think getting ordained
is important at all.

143
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,230
Doesn't the importance

144
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,520
rely on the person getting ordained?

145
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,400
Would it have been important
if it was your mother

146
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,520
who asked you to get ordained?

147
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:06,190
THUMMANAKANIMIT TEMPLE

148
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,650
Who did you promise

149
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,400
to get ordained for?

150
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,650
Who did we promise?

151
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,480
We never promised anyone.

152
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,230
I did.

153
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,770
I made a vow

154
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,730
that I would get ordained
if I won the lottery.

155
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,400
That's your problem.
It doesn't concern me.

156
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,560
It does.

157
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,650
I vowed

158
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,150
that if I won the lottery,

159
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,350
all three of us would get ordained.

160
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,230
All three of us?

161
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,400
Balloon,

162
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,900
you're gay.

163
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,770
How could you vow to get ordained?

164
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,520
I wasn't thinking.

165
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,810
You should have.

166
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,270
Luang Loong.

167
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,310
Yes?

168
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,810
-Since he already made the vow,
-Yes.

169
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,230
what should we do now, Luang Loong?

170
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,440
Fulfill your vow

171
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,480
at the place you made it.

172
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,690
This is the shrine
where First and I made the vow.

173
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,190
PEE NAK SHRINE

174
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,440
Here.

175
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,650
Why are you giving it to me?

176
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,020
Keep it with you.

177
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,020
You will know

178
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,900
when the time comes.

179
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,730
Pee Nak,

180
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,350
I came to fulfill my vow.

181
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,060
We are here to get ordained

182
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,770
because this bitch made the vow.

183
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,650
Sadhu.

184
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:05,600
My god.

185
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,150
Hello, Luang Pee.

186
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,270
We are here to get ordained.

187
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,350
Balloon.

188
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,690
He's hot.

189
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,150
I don't mind being here for three phansa.

190
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,400
First.

191
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,060
You will never be lonely.

192
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,020
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

193
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,020
Hell will get you.

194
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,480
Are you jealous, Nong?

195
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,310
You just had to pick this temple.

196
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,100
Will I have Internet here?

197
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,600
-What the hell?
-Oh, no.

198
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,560
What's with her?

199
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,850
We're sorry.

200
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,900
Why did I apologize?

201
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,270
Should we beat her up?

202
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,980
Before you beat her up,

203
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,810
you should wake Nong up first.

204
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,020
Nong.

205
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,150
Nong, pull yourself together.

206
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,940
-Let go.
-Fine.

207
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,100
Look at me, honey.

208
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,150
Hey.

209
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,980
What are you doing here?

210
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,600
So, that's the story.

211
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,770
That's why all three of us
decided to get ordained here.

212
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,190
Miss.

213
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,310
Call me mister.

214
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,690
You're gay, right?

215
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,560
We are all straight men here.

216
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,020
How could you think we're gay?

217
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,690
Right, First?

218
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:40,730
Yes.

219
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,100
Hey, guys.

220
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,310
Keep it down.

221
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,600
Are you sure you want to
get ordained at this temple?

222
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,980
Please don't discriminate us.

223
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,770
We will get ordained
at this temple no matter what.

224
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,900
That's not the case.

225
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,400
If that's not the case,

226
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,730
then what's the problem here?

227
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,690
The problem is you are gay.

228
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:00,730
Aod.

229
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,980
Did it hurt, baby?

230
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,980
Aod.

231
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,850
Take these three to their sitter.

232
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,980
Bring chanting books too.

233
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,560
Yes, Luang Por.

234
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:22,940
Remove your nail color.

235
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,730
Your sitter

236
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,850
is very strict.

237
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,650
Aod, are we almost there?

238
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,730
Yes, we're here.

239
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,150
Are you the three people
who want to get ordained?

240
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,940
Luang Por

241
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,770
texted me just now.

242
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,940
So,

243
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,980
will you be our sitter?

244
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,310
Yes.

245
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,600
Will you be able to handle it?

246
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,230
Listen.

247
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,850
Can we get

248
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,350
a young and handsome monk?

249
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,350
Can we get the one we met at the shrine?

250
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,020
The monk with fair skin, huge biceps,

251
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,400
a high nose bridge, sweet eyes,

252
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,850
-and his face--
-Mister.

253
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,270
There isn't such a person.

254
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,060
In this temple,

255
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,940
Luang Por, the abbot,
is the only monk here.

256
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,690
Besides him, this novice and I

257
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,100
are the best looking ones.

258
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,980
-Then the person I met--
-Everyone,

259
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,600
I'll take you to your rooms.

260
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,690
Come on, Aod.
We have a ceremony in the evening.

261
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,690
What about the hot monk over there?

262
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,560
Just follow me.
I don't know anyone like that.

263
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,190
I knew it. It's so heavy.
I just had to bring so much.

264
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,100
Oh, my god. Help me!

265
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,020
Oh, no.

266
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,690
Oh, no.

267
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,150
Oh, no.

268
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,310
Shit.

269
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,310
Luang Por.

270
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,350
Gosh.

271
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,850
There is a coffin!

272
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,020
-A gecko!
-First.

273
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,480
My room has a coffin, First.

274
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,520
First, my room has a coffin.

275
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,940
Talk to me...

276
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,310
What kind of person eats a fucking gecko?

277
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,650
It bit my lip.

278
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,940
You shithead.

279
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,560
-It's dirty.
-Damn it.

280
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,520
Bitch.

281
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,190
Wait.

282
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,940
What are you doing?

283
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,600
I'll get that gecko out of your lip.

284
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,730
What about my face?

285
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,730
Help me.

286
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:30,730
Stay still.

287
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:31,900
Stay still, okay?

288
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,270
One, two,

289
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,150
three.

290
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,650
Nong.

291
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,100
Nong.

292
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,150
Fuck.

293
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,350
-Shit.
-Nong.

294
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,100
First.

295
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,850
If you can get this snake off of me,

296
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,600
I'll let you touch my snake.

297
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,980
Are you serious?

298
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,230
Yes. Hurry up.

299
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,270
Gosh.

300
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,310
It's licking me. Hurry up.

301
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,310
All right.

302
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,060
First.

303
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,980
-Hurry.
-First, the head.

304
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,520
-I'll pee my pants.
-It's looking at you.

305
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,850
-Be careful.
-I'll pee my pants.

306
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,270
The tail, First. Watch its tail.

307
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,230
First.

308
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,400
-Hurry.
-I can't.

309
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,850
Please do it. I can't take it anymore.

310
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,600
It's a freaking snake!

311
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,190
Get out, Nong. Get out.

312
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,230
I'm leaving.

313
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:29,560
Nong.

314
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,270
Gosh.

315
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,310
Oh, my god.

316
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,650
What's going on?

317
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,770
-So long.
-Hey, wait.

318
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,850
Take this. Here.

319
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,900
Here's 500 baht for you.

320
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,520
Get us a new room. Let us sleep together.

321
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,230
Move my things to the new room too.

322
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,270
Hey, wait.

323
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,400
We need help at the temple.

324
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,940
Yes, I know. I'll be there.

325
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,060
Gosh.

326
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,100
My god.

327
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,350
I can't do this anymore.

328
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,060
-Please take it from me.
-Oh, no. Don't.

329
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,270
Gosh.

330
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,100
First!

331
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:14,770
This is it.

332
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,310
You guys can sleep here.

333
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,850
It's big enough

334
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,310
for the three of you.

335
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,350
Aod.

336
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,190
Why did you bring them here?

337
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,650
They will be ordained soon.

338
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,560
They shouldn't be involved with funerals.

339
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,060
It's inauspicious.

340
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,560
That's right.

341
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,100
Well...

342
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,440
Luang Por,

343
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,440
I invited the monks from Sai Temple.

344
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,100
And I informed them that you were sick

345
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,730
and won't be joining today.

346
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,520
Thank you so much.

347
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,480
Luang Por,

348
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,100
you should rest.

349
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,060
I'll take care of this end.

350
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,650
-Gosh.
-Thank you.

351
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,900
Gosh.

352
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,230
Wait.

353
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,480
Balloon.

354
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,150
-Come here.
-What now?

355
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,190
Come now.

356
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,310
He looks familiar.

357
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,850
Have we met him before?

358
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:35,850
Hang on.

359
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,520
How can he not look familiar?

360
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,400
He's lying right here.

361
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,940
Do you want to talk to him?

362
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,600
JAKKAPONG WONGWALLEE, 25 YEARS OLD

363
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,980
Jui doesn't have any relatives anymore.

364
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,310
Her parents recently passed away.

365
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,900
And now her brother too.

366
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,810
Hello, I'm Nong.

367
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,230
Let me help with the funeral.

368
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:22,770
Nong.

369
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,020
-What?
-Do you want a selfie stick?

370
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,100
You're sticking your face
all the way there.

371
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,270
Hey.

372
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,520
The monks are praying.

373
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,480
The monks are praying.

374
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:44,310
BORN

375
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,190
Do you want a piece of me?

376
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,520
Aren't you afraid of monks at all?

377
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:06,730
All right then.

378
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,270
THUMMANAKANIMIT TEMPLE SCHOOL

379
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,020
I don't hear anything.

380
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,810
What?

381
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,900
-Oh, my god.
-What happened?

382
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,310
Get the car ready. Get the car now.

383
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,600
Wait, Luang Pee.

384
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,650
The ceremony isn't complete yet.

385
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,400
-Let's leave it here today. I'm busy.
-What?

386
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,020
-We'll continue tomorrow.
-But...

387
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,770
-Wait.
-Why are you sitting there? Let's go.

388
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,190
-Wait.
-Wait for us.

389
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,150
Is it happening again?

390
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:17,560
PEE NAK SHRINE

391
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,900
Do you think

392
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,900
something's off about this temple?

393
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,150
Balloon.

394
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,350
Did you just realize this?

395
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,690
I think

396
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,150
since we stepped inside the temple,

397
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,310
nothing was normal,

398
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,150
especially

399
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,850
that old man over there.

400
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,940
First!

401
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,440
You're too loud.
Did you want him to hear you?

402
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,270
Keep it down.

403
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,100
First.

404
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,650
Balloon.

405
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,900
Thank you very much.

406
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,850
You are welcome.

407
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,020
What?

408
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,020
What are you thanking us for?

409
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,940
At first, I was going to stay
with the body alone tonight.

410
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:59,440
However, Nong said you guys volunteered
to stay here on my behalf

411
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,770
-What?
-because a girl staying here alone

412
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:02,940
may not be

413
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,560
appropriate.

414
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,400
Fuck you.

415
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,100
Of course.

416
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,980
We will

417
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,440
take the best care of him. Don't worry.

418
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,400
First, you...

419
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,980
-How can we sleep here?
-Thank you so much.

420
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,230
All right.

421
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,230
You idiot.

422
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,480
Why on earth did you agree
to stay with the body tonight, First?

423
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:28,980
It's Nong.

424
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,770
He sent me this sign.

425
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:34,400
You would do anything for a man.

426
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,980
Hello.

427
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,100
You are here with Balloon again.

428
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,940
We are live at a funeral.

429
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,810
So what? Who cares?

430
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,100
You're not even scared of your ugly face.

431
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,560
Those who are interested, please confirm.
We have a promotion today.

432
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:53,730
"You look prettier."

433
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:56,270
I'll give you a discount.

434
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,900
"Hey,

435
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,270
I see a hand from the coffin."

436
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
Where?

437
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,940
You guys are joking around
because you know I'm scared of ghosts.

438
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,730
I'm not scared even if I'm in a temple.
Don't try to fucking trick me.

439
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,810
You guys are at it.
Why are you typing so much?

440
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:18,060
I'm never scared of anything.
Let them come.

441
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,940
Let ten of them come.

442
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,600
Let's continue with our sales.

443
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,150
"It's even higher up now, sis."

444
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,810
Who's your sister?

445
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,350
Where?

446
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,940
Can it get any higher?

447
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,230
Stop trying to trick me.

448
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,230
Leave if you don't want to buy anything.

449
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,350
"The whole body is there."

450
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:55,940
He's here, isn't he?

451
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:06,690
First.

452
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,690
First.

453
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,730
Nong.

454
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,270
What the fuck?

455
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,440
First, Nong, guys!

456
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,940
What the hell is wrong with you?

457
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,600
-Oh, my god.
-What's with you? You scared me.

458
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:41,850
The thought came to me.

459
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,270
What thought?

460
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:45,980
Look to my left.

461
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,600
This photo.

462
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,940
What photo?

463
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,520
This photo. Think about it.

464
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,060
At the shrine.

465
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,690
What shrine?

466
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,520
The shrine we were at this evening.

467
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,690
The handsome monk.

468
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:02,350
The handsome monk with the hot body.

469
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,350
The handsome monk?

470
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,650
Stop drooling, bitch.

471
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:07,850
First.

472
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,100
Then who's in the coffin?

473
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,770
It's him. You dumbass.

474
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,400
You're calling me dumb again.

475
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,560
You are dumb. You wouldn't listen to me.

476
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:17,730
You didn't explain it to me, First.

477
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:20,770
I tried, but you kept pointing at things.
You wouldn't listen.

478
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:22,270
I'm not the only dumb one here, idiot.

479
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:25,150
Did you call me an idiot? How could you?

480
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,850
You wouldn't explain it to me properly.

481
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,900
I explained it to you.

482
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,900
Shut up!

483
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,230
What have you done?

484
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,020
What the hell are you guys doing?

485
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,980
Hey. What the hell?

486
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,770
Hey, it's me.

487
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:43,900
It's me.

488
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,020
Damn it, Nong.

489
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,150
Why would you put on a face mask?

490
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,020
You put it on for me.

491
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,400
Why the fuck did you freak out then?

492
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,850
I'm sorry. I forgot.

493
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,480
Nong, we were haunted.

494
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,100
-It was so scary.
-What the hell have you done?

495
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,900
Put the coffin back right now,

496
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,770
or we'll be scolded by Luang Por.

497
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,730
Aren't you holding onto me too tightly?

498
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:11,810
I'm scared, Nong.

499
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:13,650
Shit.

500
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,850
-Shit.
-What?

501
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,350
The body is gone.

502
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:25,770
The body is gone.

503
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,310
Are you sure, Nong?

504
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,940
Look carefully.

505
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,520
Look at it.

506
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:38,810
What should we do?

507
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,270
Look behind the curtain.

508
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,690
I'm not wearing my contact lens.
I can't see.

509
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:56,650
What?

510
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,060
Nong.

511
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,440
Nong.

512
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:02,520
What?

513
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,350
You left me.

514
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,150
First, you look at it.

515
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:18,600
My glasses are foggy. I can't see. Here.

516
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,600
What's wrong with you?

517
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,850
Guys, I can't see.

518
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,480
You're not blind.

519
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,850
Fuck.

520
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,480
I'm scared.

521
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,560
There's nothing to be scared of.

522
00:33:58,690 --> 00:33:59,940
Balloon, how was it?

523
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,730
-What happened?
-Balloon.

524
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:04,770
Hey. Balloon.

525
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,480
Balloon, don't.

526
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,560
I'm leaving.

527
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:09,850
Hey. Balloon.

528
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,060
Balloon, wait.

529
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,400
What's going on here?

530
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,060
Luang Por.

531
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,480
Luang Por.

532
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,810
The legend at this temple

533
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,560
is quite paranormal.

534
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,060
No one can never fully
become a monk at this temple.

535
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:29,850
-What?
-What?

536
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,150
In these past years,

537
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:33,980
people who came to get ordained

538
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,810
usually died at the stage of being a nak.

539
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,310
No one has successfully become a monk yet.

540
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,810
-Fuck.
-Fuck.

541
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,350
You didn't swear at me, did you?

542
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,270
I did.

543
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,810
Hey.

544
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,690
Please continue. I wasn't swearing at you.

545
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,650
People say

546
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,020
that the person who died

547
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,060
would come to find someone
to take his place.

548
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,770
He would come to haunt

549
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,440
and kill the next person.

550
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,400
Sometimes at night,

551
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:05,350
you would see a nak parade
heading to the temple

552
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,480
but no one

553
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,480
would have a head.

554
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,100
And the cheering

555
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,350
would turn into a painful moaning instead.

556
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,060
Therefore, everyone concludes that

557
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,980
people who get ordained at this temple

558
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,600
will die mysteriously.

559
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,270
And they say the closer you are
to the ceremony,

560
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,650
the scarier it gets.

561
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,060
Oh, my god.

562
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,600
Balloon.

563
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,560
Did you not do a research
beforehand at all?

564
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,100
Bitch.

565
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:51,270
You would have found out
that the temple is really haunted.

566
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,100
Novice,

567
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,900
then please let the three of us

568
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,270
sleep with you tonight.

569
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,230
What?

570
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,900
Wait for me.
My eyebrows are getting ruined, bitch.

571
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,850
Is this the time?

572
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,310
Apply more powder.

573
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,350
Try it and you might be as pretty as me.

574
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,310
Hey.

575
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,520
Keep it down.

576
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,190
Do I not have enough makeup, Nong?

577
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,400
Nong said I didn't have enough.

578
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,060
Your face is as thick as a boxer's face.

579
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,020
First.

580
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:48,100
Did the wound that gecko left you
disappear already?

581
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,230
Don't tell me you had a plastic surgeon
to Netflix and chill at the temple.

582
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,520
It doesn't concern you.

583
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,900
I did things my way.

584
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,020
How do my eyebrows look right now?

585
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,310
Balloon.

586
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:05,600
Why would we need Arabica coffee

587
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:06,560
when we have

588
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:09,980
a hot guy like him to keep us awake?

589
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,060
Since we came,
I've only seen monks and ghosts.

590
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,900
I haven't seen any hot guys.

591
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,940
Which direction?

592
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,100
Your nine o'clock.

593
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,560
Nine o'clock.

594
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,600
Hottie.

595
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:26,190
How can gay men get ordained?

596
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:29,020
They are going wild
just seeing a man taking a shower.

597
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,520
It's inappropriate.

598
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,350
Balloon, First, let's go.

599
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,190
-Let's go.
-This one.

600
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,900
What's this can?

601
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,480
-Let's go.
-First.

602
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,100
First.

603
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,350
What?

604
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,730
What's wrong?

605
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,980
-What's wrong?
-First.

606
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,980
Wait. Hold me. My back hurts.

607
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,190
-Let's go.
-Don't go yet.

608
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,310
It might go back to sleep.

609
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,150
Come on. Let's go inside.

610
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:55,730
First.

611
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:57,980
Shall we kick their butts?

612
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,770
How dare you insult me?

613
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:00,850
Damn them.

614
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,020
Is this your Nak Prok pendant?

615
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,810
Yes, it's mine.

616
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,270
Aod found it

617
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:17,650
when he was moving your things,

618
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,600
but he forgot to give it back.

619
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:23,650
I've prepared your tuition fee.
Don't worry.

620
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,770
Did you transfer money to a guy again?

621
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,560
You're about to be ordained.

622
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,480
First,

623
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,350
I'm just here to fulfill my vow.

624
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,440
I'm not here to fucking get enlightened.

625
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:44,480
Can you stop fooling yourself?

626
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,650
You're gay. You don't have a uterus.

627
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,730
Shouldn't you save this money

628
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,770
for your future?

629
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:55,400
Think about your disabled mother.

630
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,810
First.

631
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,150
What?

632
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,520
My mom isn't disabled.

633
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:05,730
That was Got's mother.

634
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,270
I forgot.

635
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,730
By the way, what has gotten into you?

636
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,850
Don't tell me
that you haven't told your dad

637
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,350
about ordaining.

638
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,060
We'll only be ordained for a short while.

639
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,270
It's not a big deal.

640
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,100
First,

641
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,230
this ordainment

642
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:32,150
will make a military man like your father

643
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:35,310
proud of a beautiful gay son like you.

644
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:39,900
This yellow piece of cloth
will send your dad to heaven

645
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,900
faster than taking a jet plane.

646
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:47,230
My dad wouldn't even let me

647
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,730
wear a skirt.

648
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:53,560
Would he be able to take it?

649
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,270
You haven't even tried telling him though.

650
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,480
Do you have dermatophytosis?

651
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,440
-No, I don't.
-No, I don't.

652
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,650
Do you have bronchiectasis?

653
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,230
-No, I don't.
-No, I don't.

654
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,600
Do you have epilepsy?

655
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:16,730
-No, I don't.
-No, I don't.

656
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,440
Are you a human being?

657
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,310
-Yes, I am.
-Yes, I am.

658
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,560
Look over there, human.

659
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:26,400
-Yes, I am.
-Yes, I am.

660
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,060
Hey, what's with that script?

661
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,270
Oh, shit.

662
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:30,730
What do you mean?

663
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,150
That ghost is out in daylight.
It's not afraid at all.

664
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,560
Do you see it?

665
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,310
That's a human, not a ghost, Balloon.

666
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,440
-Thief!
-Thief!

667
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,730
Balloon. Hey...

668
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,060
You old hag, you can't steal things
from the temple.

669
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,020
You can't do that.

670
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,270
Guys, what the hell?

671
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,730
-Guys, what's with her?
-What's wrong with her?

672
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:55,270
-Nong, what's wrong with her?
-What?

673
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,400
-Nong.
-Oh, my god.

674
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:59,350
What the hell?

675
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:01,940
-Nak.
-Nak?

676
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:02,900
Guys.

677
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,150
I'm not a nak.

678
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,560
Nong.

679
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,600
-Nak.
-Nong.

680
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:09,690
-What should we do?
-Guys.

681
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:10,940
-Nong.
-Guys.

682
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,480
-Hey.
-No.

683
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,310
-Nak.
-Help me.

684
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,270
-Let my friend go, you psycho.
-Nak.

685
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:22,150
Guys, help me.

686
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,850
He's mine.

687
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,850
Who said so?

688
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,230
-Oh, my god.
-Get out.

689
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,270
Hey, you!

690
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,520
-Hey.
-Let go, old hag.

691
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,020
-Let him go.
-First.

692
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:35,600
-Miss.
-Nong.

693
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,230
Who is she?

694
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,270
You don't need to know.

695
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,270
You should just worry about yourselves.

696
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:44,770
Nak.

697
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:47,310
-Let's go. That's not him.
-Nak.

698
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,440
-What?
-He's not a nak.

699
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,480
-He's not.
-Nak.

700
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,480
You psycho!

701
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,810
Who the hell is she?

702
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,400
Why does she act like she knows me?

703
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,400
Guys.

704
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,480
I wonder the same.

705
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,810
That old man too.

706
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,900
-He looks suspicious somehow.
-Guys.

707
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,480
Is this a temple
or a murder scene in Conan?

708
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:06,440
There are so many mysterious characters.

709
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,020
Will I get to ordain?

710
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:11,150
-Guys, it hurts.
-Are you all right?

711
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:13,150
Oh, no. It's all over you.

712
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,520
Farewell, Jak.

713
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:50,900
It will be okay.

714
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,400
Jak has gone to a better place.

715
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,850
Thank you so much for your help, Nong.

716
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,270
Please accept my condolences.

717
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,850
Try not to think too much.

718
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:23,100
-What's wrong, Nong?
-Nong.

719
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:24,150
-What?
-What's wrong?

720
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:25,850
-Calm down. What's wrong?
-Nong.

721
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,730
-What's wrong?
-What did you see?

722
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:28,980
-What's wrong?
-Say something.

723
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,190
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

724
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,900
-I'm fine.
-What?

725
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,350
-Is he fine?
-Jui.

726
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,770
-Nong.
-I'll see you later.

727
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:37,480
What's going on, Nong?

728
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:52,600
Nong.

729
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,400
What happened?

730
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,100
You looked troubled back there.

731
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,150
Nong.

732
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,480
Nong.

733
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:03,520
Are you all right?

734
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:09,440
I think the ghost
that has been haunting us

735
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:11,520
isn't Jak's ghost.

736
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,690
Did you see its face?

737
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,270
Its arm

738
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:21,730
was full of tattoos.

739
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:25,440
And do you remember

740
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:27,770
that Jak's body

741
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:29,850
had no tattoos at all?

742
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:34,520
It could be a different ghost.

743
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:35,730
Jeez.

744
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:37,230
What the hell?

745
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:40,150
I almost went crazy because of one ghost.

746
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:41,770
And now there's a second one.

747
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,230
...unguents or adornments.

748
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,440
-...unguents or adornments.
-...unguents or adornments.

749
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,940
I will not sleep in comfortable beds...

750
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:05,230
-I will not sleep in comfortable beds...
-I will not sleep in comfortable beds...

751
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,650
...with padding or cotton.

752
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:10,600
-...with padding or cotton.
-...with padding or cotton.

753
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,650
I will not touch

754
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:16,060
or accept money...

755
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:18,770
-I will not touch
-I will not touch

756
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:21,730
-or accept money...
-or accept money...

757
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,940
...that will profit us.

758
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,730
-...that will profit us.
-...that will profit us.

759
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:28,980
Can you cite it
without looking at the book?

760
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,270
I will

761
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:31,730
not

762
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:32,810
dance--

763
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,520
-It's "listen."
-Oh, my...

764
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,650
You scared me.

765
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:37,650
...listen to music

766
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:38,770
or watch any drama--

767
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:40,230
"Any dance"!

768
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,150
You keep wanting to watch dramas.

769
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:43,480
This is a religious chant,

770
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,850
not "Sabai Sabai" by Thongchai McIntyre

771
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,480
that I listened to since I was young.

772
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,770
Who could memorize all of these?

773
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,730
Exactly, and there are ten rules.

774
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:52,770
We can barely chant

775
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,150
the most basic prayer.

776
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:57,020
Aod, give us some time.

777
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:57,980
He's right.

778
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,770
How long do you need?

779
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,850
You're already behind schedule.

780
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:03,980
Let's do it again.

781
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,060
-I will not touch
-I will not touch

782
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:10,150
-or accept money
-or accept money

783
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,190
-that will profit us.
-that will profit us.

784
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,400
I will not

785
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:16,980
listen

786
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:19,350
to music

787
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,150
or watch any dance.

788
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:25,850
I will not

789
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:27,480
decorate myself

790
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:29,400
with garlands,

791
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:31,520
perfumes,

792
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,150
unguents,

793
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:37,730
or adornments.

794
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,100
I will not sleep

795
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,980
in comfortable beds

796
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:46,020
with padding or cotton.

797
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,900
I will not touch...

798
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:50,980
What's next?

799
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,900
"Or accept money."

800
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,440
Oh, right.

801
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:58,850
That will profit us...

802
00:47:58,730 --> 00:47:59,650
Balloon.

803
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:03,770
First.

804
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:10,520
Hey.

805
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:12,230
Balloon.

806
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:13,900
First.

807
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:17,270
First.

808
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:39,150
Hey.

809
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,480
You can come out now.

810
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:43,600
Balloon.

811
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:47,020
First.

812
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,770
I'll seriously kick you guys.

813
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:52,020
Stop joking around.

814
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,480
Hey.

815
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:03,690
First.

816
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,310
Oh, my god. Aod!

817
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,230
Since when were you here?

818
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:46,600
Are you sure that you want

819
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,690
to get ordained?

820
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:53,900
It's not too late to change your mind.

821
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:56,520
What do you mean?

822
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,730
What's with you?

823
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,230
Your pendant looks nice.

824
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:15,770
Doesn't it make you uncomfortable?

825
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:33,480
I warned you.

826
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,400
No.

827
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,600
Hey.

828
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:49,900
Let me go.

829
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,940
Let me go.

830
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:54,440
Hey.

831
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,690
I will kill everyone

832
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:59,060
who gets ordained.

833
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:13,730
What...

834
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:16,730
No.

835
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:30,100
No.

836
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,400
No.

837
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:35,150
No.

838
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:39,350
No!

839
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:47,730
What's wrong?

840
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:50,650
Novice,

841
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,980
a ghost haunted me last night.

842
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:56,020
He said he would kill all of us

843
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,770
if we got ordained.

844
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:00,770
Why does the ghost
want to take revenge on naks?

845
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:03,270
Can we not become a nak, Novice?

846
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,940
Can we just skip it and become monks?

847
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,730
No.

848
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,400
Becoming a nak

849
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:14,400
is a very important process

850
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:17,020
because there's a story behind it.

851
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:26,190
Once, there was the Phaya Nak

852
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,150
who transformed himself into a human

853
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,020
because he believed in Buddhism.

854
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:34,650
He came to get ordained.

855
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:47,520
However, later,

856
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:51,190
the truth was revealed

857
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:53,150
that he wasn't human

858
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:58,600
but a nak who disguised himself.

859
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:20,190
Naks like him didn't deserve
to be born as a human.

860
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,060
He couldn't get ordained

861
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,520
because he would never be enlightened

862
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,190
if everyone found out he was a nak.

863
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:33,690
The nak was very disappointed when
he heard that he couldn't get ordained.

864
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,100
However, he left his name

865
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,480
with other humans
who were getting ordained,

866
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:49,560
to receive merit

867
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:52,020
that he couldn't do it himself.

868
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:57,270
As for him,

869
00:53:57,690 --> 00:53:59,230
he vowed to serve Buddhism

870
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:03,150
in other ways.

871
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,480
And that is why

872
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,270
newly ordained people

873
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:17,480
are called "naga" or "nak" since then.

874
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,150
Keep in mind

875
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:24,020
that you deserved merit
enough to be born as human

876
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:27,020
with an opportunity to get ordained.

877
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:45,150
The nak didn't kill Jak, did he?

878
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:47,600
Well...

879
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,440
How are you feeling?

880
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,560
Are you okay?

881
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,650
At first, I wasn't okay.

882
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,730
But I'm starting to accept the truth.

883
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:18,350
Eventually,

884
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:21,270
people part ways.

885
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:28,350
It's just a matter of time.

886
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:02,650
Jui.

887
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:04,440
Well, Jui.

888
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,310
It's done.

889
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:09,400
You can collect his ashes.

890
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,350
-Okay.
-Okay.

891
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,350
Please excuse me then.

892
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:17,650
I'll talk to you next time.

893
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,350
Okay.

894
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:01,980
Where's the noise coming from?

895
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,350
My god.

896
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:12,230
Who's that?

897
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,440
Is that you, Nong?

898
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,350
Yes.

899
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:20,980
Oh, gosh.

900
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:22,270
Nong.

901
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:23,900
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming here?

902
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:26,060
You scared me, Nong.

903
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:34,940
Nong.

904
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,560
Nong.

905
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:02,560
Are you farting lightly
or breathing really heavily?

906
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:07,270
Are you all right, Nong?

907
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:08,600
Are you all right, Nong?

908
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:13,810
Oh, my god. Nong, the lights went off.

909
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,190
Where's my flashlight?

910
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:18,900
Nong, are you still there?

911
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,150
Why is this happening to me?
I need to shit.

912
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:25,020
Nong, you didn't wait for me.
Please, wait for me.

913
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:27,520
Nong!

914
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,480
Nong.

915
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:36,730
Nong.

916
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:39,190
Nong.

917
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,310
Are you in here, Nong?

918
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,400
Nong.

919
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,730
Nong, is that you?

920
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:00,190
To be honest,

921
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:02,560
I like seeing you take a shower.

922
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,730
But isn't it a bit odd

923
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,770
to take shower

924
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:11,850
at this late hour?

925
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:14,850
Nong.

926
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:22,600
Nong.

927
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:25,100
I'm scared, Nong.

928
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:28,480
Oh, my god.

929
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:32,190
Nong.

930
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:37,230
Nong.

931
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,600
Please hurry up and finish your shower.

932
00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:42,850
I'm scared, Nong.

933
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:46,650
I'm scared. Gosh!

934
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:48,900
Nong.

935
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:51,770
Why is your neck like that, Nong?

936
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,690
-Damn it, First. What's wrong?
-I'm scared.

937
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:10,600
First, it's me.

938
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:12,810
-No. Don't.
-It's me.

939
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:14,100
What's wrong?

940
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:16,600
Hey.

941
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:21,600
Don't possess me.

942
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,020
What? I'm human.

943
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:25,480
I don't believe you.

944
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:28,560
-Homage to the blessed...
-First, it's me.

945
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:31,270
I'm human, Mr. Chartchai.

946
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:38,440
Here. Touch me if you don't believe me.

947
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,400
Okay.

948
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:54,900
I'm still not certain though.

949
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:56,690
What the hell?

950
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:10,900
Hey.

951
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:11,980
That's enough.

952
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,060
Are you human?

953
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:19,650
Of course.

954
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:21,770
If you're really human,

955
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:25,850
then you must remember
the promise you gave me.

956
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,650
What promise?

957
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,100
That I could touch your snake.

958
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,400
Oh, my god. Fuck you.

959
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:36,520
First.

960
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:37,810
Fuck you.

961
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:39,480
Damn you.

962
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:43,150
Stop. I'm sorry. It hurts. Oh, my god.

963
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:44,770
What the hell was that?

964
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,650
It's really you.

965
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,480
Of course, it is.

966
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,230
I will kill everyone who gets in my way.

967
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:15,730
Hey.

968
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:17,520
Hang on, First.

969
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:19,060
What?

970
01:02:19,730 --> 01:02:21,730
I hear a bell ringing.

971
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:25,600
Who would ring a bell at this hour?

972
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:34,600
-Balloon.
-Balloon.

973
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:36,850
Let's go there now.

974
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:40,270
Oh, my god.

975
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:43,150
-Balloon.
-Balloon.

976
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:45,560
-What are you doing?
-Help me, First.

977
01:02:45,650 --> 01:02:47,190
Why are you banging your head on the bell?

978
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:50,520
What sort of crazy person rings their head
on a bell? I can't control it, dumbass.

979
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,940
-What? This isn't right, bitch.
-Help me.

980
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:53,850
Damn it.

981
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:54,900
-Nong.
-Hey.

982
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:56,230
What the hell, First?

983
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,150
-It's a ghost.
-Why aren't we helping him?

984
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:00,270
-Help me, you fucktards.
-You can't, Nong.

985
01:03:00,350 --> 01:03:02,480
-He will die.
-We will die.

986
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:03,900
-Nong, don't.
-Hey.

987
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:06,150
-Nong, don't.
-Move aside right now.

988
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:07,600
-No.
-Move.

989
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:09,310
First, Nong, help me.

990
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,150
-First, help me.
-Balloon.

991
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:12,980
Balloon.

992
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:14,980
-Balloon.
-Help him.

993
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:16,980
Guys...

994
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:20,190
-Hang on, Balloon.
-Balloon, what's going on?

995
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:25,230
Shit.

996
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:26,230
Balloon.

997
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:27,980
First, hold this.

998
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,650
Stand on my shoulders.

999
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:31,270
Stand on my shoulders.

1000
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:33,900
Balloon, are you okay?

1001
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:35,520
Put it down.

1002
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:36,690
I'm doing it.

1003
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:37,980
Climb up.

1004
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:40,900
Cut it.

1005
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:43,730
My God.

1006
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:44,770
Balloon.

1007
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:47,650
Balloon.

1008
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:49,600
-How's he, Nong?
-Oh, no.

1009
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:53,150
He's not breathing.

1010
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:54,980
Balloon.

1011
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:56,690
Balloon.

1012
01:03:57,150 --> 01:03:58,600
Balloon.

1013
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:02,230
I must perform CPR on him.

1014
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:10,810
Wait.

1015
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:12,270
Nong.

1016
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:15,400
You can't.

1017
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:18,810
Leave it to me.

1018
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:27,150
Balloon.

1019
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:29,520
I'll save you.

1020
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:41,600
Don't.

1021
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:42,650
First.

1022
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:44,230
Balloon.

1023
01:04:44,310 --> 01:04:45,270
Balloon.

1024
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,150
Why did you hit me, bitch?

1025
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,270
You can't kiss me, bitch. I'm your friend.

1026
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:52,310
Guys.

1027
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,270
What?

1028
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:55,270
I heard the ghost say

1029
01:04:55,770 --> 01:04:57,520
he will kill everyone

1030
01:04:57,850 --> 01:04:59,270
who gets in his way.

1031
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,810
Who will get in his way besides us

1032
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:06,600
who want to get ordained?

1033
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:10,100
Thus indeed

1034
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:12,440
Is that blessed one

1035
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:14,100
-He is the holy one
-He is the holy one

1036
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:16,900
-Fully enlightened
-Fully enlightened

1037
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:23,060
Endowed with clear vision

1038
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:25,230
-And virtuous conduct
-And virtuous conduct

1039
01:05:25,310 --> 01:05:27,270
-Sublime
-Sublime

1040
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:50,770
-The knower of the worlds
-Knower of the worlds

1041
01:05:50,850 --> 01:05:52,400
The incomparable leader of men

1042
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,480
To be tamed

1043
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:59,150
The teacher of gods and men

1044
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:03,270
Enlightened and blessed

1045
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:07,480
If I don't get to be ordained,

1046
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:10,230
then no one will.

1047
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:19,980
Luang Por.

1048
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:33,100
Normally, Luang Por
wakes up before everyone.

1049
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:36,560
Why didn't he wake up today?

1050
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:38,850
I wonder the same.

1051
01:06:43,150 --> 01:06:44,600
Is Luang Por sick?

1052
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:48,020
Aod.

1053
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:50,940
Oh, my...

1054
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:54,060
What's going on?

1055
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:00,310
Luang Por!

1056
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:03,100
-What is it, Aod?
-Aod, open the door.

1057
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,560
Aod, open the door.

1058
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:08,060
Luang Por.

1059
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:09,730
-Luang Por.
-Luang Por.

1060
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:11,650
Aod, how is he?

1061
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:13,060
Luang Por.

1062
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:15,230
Luang Por.

1063
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,850
-Luang Por.
-Luang Por.

1064
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:21,730
-Luang Por.
-Luang Por.

1065
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:23,190
Luang Por.

1066
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:24,270
Luang Por.

1067
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,850
Luang Por.

1068
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:27,520
Luang Por.

1069
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:32,980
Novice,

1070
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:36,270
the undertaker wants me to tell you

1071
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,940
that Luang Por's relatives

1072
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,190
will come to bring his body home.

1073
01:07:45,850 --> 01:07:46,900
Aod.

1074
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:50,020
Luang Por isn't with us anymore.

1075
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:52,730
How will we carry on?

1076
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:59,730
Our temple has no monk.

1077
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:11,150
Stay strong, Aod.

1078
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:14,850
You'll have monks.

1079
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:16,730
You have the three of us.

1080
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:27,900
Thank you so much.

1081
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:32,440
But I'm fine now.

1082
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:36,650
Tomorrow,

1083
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:38,770
I'll prepare for your ordainment.

1084
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:43,060
Please excuse me.

1085
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:52,560
I'll help Grandpa out.

1086
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:53,980
That's okay, Aod.

1087
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:56,230
I'll go.

1088
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:58,310
I want to check on Novice too.

1089
01:09:30,650 --> 01:09:31,650
Oh, no.

1090
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:34,980
What's wrong?

1091
01:09:38,310 --> 01:09:39,310
First.

1092
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:42,270
Taohoo broke up with me.

1093
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:48,600
He said he knocked up a girl.

1094
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:00,100
It's okay.

1095
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:03,020
If only I didn't make the damn vow,

1096
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:06,270
all of this shit wouldn't have happened.

1097
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:09,900
I would still be with him.

1098
01:10:11,230 --> 01:10:12,850
Luang Por would still be alive.

1099
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:16,100
All of this didn't happen
because of your vow.

1100
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:19,850
Balloon.

1101
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:23,230
What will you do?

1102
01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:26,440
-Balloon.
-Wait.

1103
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:27,770
What will you do, Balloon?

1104
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:31,770
Everything started at the shrine.

1105
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,900
Therefore, it must end at the shrine.

1106
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,520
Move aside!

1107
01:11:01,810 --> 01:11:03,150
Why did Jui come?

1108
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:14,940
Balloon.

1109
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:16,020
Balloon.

1110
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:18,560
Balloon.

1111
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:20,400
Balloon, don't.

1112
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,350
Balloon, don't.

1113
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,440
-What do you want?
-Don't do it.

1114
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:26,440
What will you get
out of destroying the shrine?

1115
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,560
You could die.

1116
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:29,560
I've had enough with this fucking ghost.

1117
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:30,770
Move aside!

1118
01:11:31,730 --> 01:11:32,690
Fuck you.

1119
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,150
Fuck you. I can't take it anymore.

1120
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:40,100
I made a vow,

1121
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:41,560
and you wanted me to fulfill it.

1122
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:43,850
Now that I'm here,
you wouldn't let me get ordained.

1123
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:45,060
What do you want with me?

1124
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:46,560
Calm down.

1125
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:47,650
Stay out of it.

1126
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:51,730
I have had enough with you, dumb ghost.

1127
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:52,690
PEE NAK SHRINE

1128
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:54,650
You decided to piss me off?

1129
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:55,900
All right then.

1130
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:57,350
You wanted to piss me off, right?

1131
01:11:57,810 --> 01:11:59,850
-Here you go.
-Hey.

1132
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:01,650
Hey.

1133
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:13,650
Jui.

1134
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:16,100
Jui.

1135
01:12:16,230 --> 01:12:17,730
Why didn't you say goodbye?

1136
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,060
Nong.

1137
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:24,600
Actually, I was going to leave
after Jak's ordainment.

1138
01:12:25,150 --> 01:12:26,400
But then he passed away,

1139
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,270
so I asked my office
if I could stay here longer.

1140
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:32,730
But you are the reason

1141
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:35,560
that I'm staying here to get ordained.

1142
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:37,980
Nong.

1143
01:12:38,810 --> 01:12:41,270
Why exactly did you come here
to get ordained?

1144
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:47,560
You were just like me.

1145
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:50,900
We were heartbroken.
Something bad happened to us,

1146
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:53,230
so we needed someone to rely on.

1147
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:57,520
You may think
that you have feelings for me.

1148
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:00,270
But actually, you don't really love me.

1149
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:02,650
You're just afraid of being alone.

1150
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,850
I felt the same way.

1151
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:07,850
I didn't want to be alone.

1152
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,980
I'm sorry.

1153
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:14,980
The only thing you should be thinking
about right now is your ordainment.

1154
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,440
Do it for yourself

1155
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:19,100
and your father.

1156
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:22,350
Nong.

1157
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:23,650
Something bad has happened.

1158
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:25,060
What is it, Novice?

1159
01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:28,100
Aod called and said

1160
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,100
that Balloon went to destroy the shrine.

1161
01:13:30,190 --> 01:13:31,100
What?

1162
01:13:32,650 --> 01:13:33,900
That's enough.

1163
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:35,060
-Balloon, enough.
-Stop.

1164
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:37,100
There comes the alms bowl.

1165
01:13:37,230 --> 01:13:38,310
That's enough.

1166
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:40,480
-Nong, let's go.
-Balloon.

1167
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,400
-Nong, hurry.
-Balloon.

1168
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:44,940
What the hell are you doing? Get out.

1169
01:13:46,150 --> 01:13:48,310
Balloon, what the hell are you doing?

1170
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,810
-There.
-Oh, my god.

1171
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:52,400
What are you doing? You will kill us all.

1172
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:54,690
Look at what he did.

1173
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,060
Show yourself.

1174
01:14:21,150 --> 01:14:22,150
Balloon.

1175
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:24,150
Don't just make a sound.

1176
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:42,520
Hello.

1177
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:43,560
I'm selling ice-cream.

1178
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:45,770
Here. I have black bean
and coconut milk flavors.

1179
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:47,270
Do you want one?

1180
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:49,350
Damn it, you old man!

1181
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:50,900
-Hey.
-Balloon.

1182
01:14:51,770 --> 01:14:53,100
-Calm down.
-Hey.

1183
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:55,020
Damn it.

1184
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:57,020
Look.

1185
01:15:04,650 --> 01:15:05,730
Nak.

1186
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:10,730
Where did Nak go?

1187
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:12,810
Nak, where did you go?

1188
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:17,600
Where did Nak go?

1189
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:23,310
-Go away.
-What do you want?

1190
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,600
-What do you want?
-Go away.

1191
01:15:25,690 --> 01:15:26,730
Get out.

1192
01:15:37,150 --> 01:15:39,400
My child.

1193
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:41,650
-Let's help her out.
-My child.

1194
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:44,230
-My child!
-Oh, my...

1195
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:46,270
My child!

1196
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,520
My child.

1197
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,350
My child.

1198
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:52,650
Nak.

1199
01:15:52,730 --> 01:15:54,020
Nak.

1200
01:15:54,690 --> 01:15:55,690
Miss,

1201
01:15:56,190 --> 01:15:57,810
I'm sorry.

1202
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:01,600
I got carried away.

1203
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:04,400
Go away.

1204
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:05,730
-Go away.
-It's okay.

1205
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:07,270
-It's okay.
-Go away.

1206
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:09,520
-It will be okay.
-My friend didn't mean it.

1207
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:10,650
-Go away.
-Please calm down.

1208
01:16:10,730 --> 01:16:11,850
-I'm sorry.
-Go away.

1209
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:13,310
I said, go away!

1210
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,230
-Oh, my god.
-Go away.

1211
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:18,400
-Miss.
-Wait, miss.

1212
01:16:22,270 --> 01:16:23,480
What should we do, Novice?

1213
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:25,480
What the hell have you done, Balloon?

1214
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:28,900
Why didn't you think before you did it?

1215
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:40,900
Guys.

1216
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:42,770
This photo.

1217
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:43,730
What?

1218
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:45,400
Look, Nong.

1219
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,650
We must find out

1220
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:49,400
who this nak is

1221
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:51,940
and how he's related to this woman.

1222
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,440
Who can we ask about this?

1223
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:55,770
Guys.

1224
01:16:57,980 --> 01:16:58,940
You could ask my grandpa.

1225
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:04,350
Grandpa,

1226
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:05,440
I know

1227
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:07,940
that you know who this guy is

1228
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:09,440
and how he's related to Pee Nak's ghost.

1229
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:12,520
It's been a long time already.

1230
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:15,350
I, myself,

1231
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:18,520
tried to forget about Non, the Nak.

1232
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:24,270
I think it was seven years ago.

1233
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:27,650
There was a woman

1234
01:17:28,730 --> 01:17:30,230
named Phorn.

1235
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,850
She brought her son, Non, to this temple

1236
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:35,810
to get ordained.

1237
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:39,940
Non, the Nak,

1238
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:42,600
used to be a gangster.

1239
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:46,350
He went to prison many times.

1240
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:50,940
And he was also arrested for murder.

1241
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:57,060
But then one day,
he wanted to get ordained

1242
01:17:57,350 --> 01:17:59,150
for his mother.

1243
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:03,150
However, on the day of his ordainment,

1244
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:06,600
he passed away.

1245
01:18:06,690 --> 01:18:07,810
THUMMANAKANIMIT TEMPLE

1246
01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:36,020
-What?
-Nak? Where?

1247
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:38,230
Move aside.

1248
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:40,810
Move aside. Make way.

1249
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,440
-No.
-Hurry.

1250
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:43,480
Nak!

1251
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:44,560
Nak Non!

1252
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:47,400
Nak Non.

1253
01:18:52,150 --> 01:18:53,900
Non.

1254
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:56,520
Non, here's the lotus. Hold the lotus.

1255
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:59,100
Let's head in the chapel.
It's almost time.

1256
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:03,560
Phorn was devastated.

1257
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:06,600
She became crazy.

1258
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:09,230
She told everyone

1259
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:10,900
to not touch

1260
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:13,810
-her son's body.
-Don't touch him. He's not dead.

1261
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:15,440
You can't take him away.

1262
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:17,310
As we are speaking, his body

1263
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,730
is being kept in the old chapel
behind the temple.

1264
01:19:19,810 --> 01:19:20,900
Stay away from my child.

1265
01:19:22,850 --> 01:19:24,190
So that's what happened.

1266
01:19:26,690 --> 01:19:28,230
Damn it, Balloon.

1267
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:30,060
Balloon, enough.

1268
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:33,400
Why did I have to be that hot-headed?

1269
01:19:35,650 --> 01:19:37,270
Why does Nak Non's pendant

1270
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,520
look exactly like Nong's pendant?

1271
01:19:47,230 --> 01:19:48,560
Nong, look at this picture.

1272
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:50,480
That's Luang Loong.

1273
01:19:50,730 --> 01:19:52,850
He's Luang Loong
that we met in the hospital, right?

1274
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:55,350
Why are you giving it to me?

1275
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:57,020
Keep it with you.

1276
01:19:57,100 --> 01:19:59,730
You will know when the time comes.

1277
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:01,980
-Nak, my child.
-Nong.

1278
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:04,650
Can I see the pendant you're wearing?

1279
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:10,100
This is the same Nak Prok pendant

1280
01:20:10,650 --> 01:20:12,770
that Non, the Nak,

1281
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:16,100
gave to this monk before he passed away.

1282
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,020
It's this pendant.

1283
01:20:23,730 --> 01:20:24,770
Phorn.

1284
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:35,520
Go away.

1285
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:41,270
Miss, I'm sorry.

1286
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:44,850
They are here to apologize, Phorn.

1287
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:53,150
Phorn, it's okay.

1288
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:57,100
-Miss, I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

1289
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:00,150
Miss, I didn't mean to do it.

1290
01:21:07,310 --> 01:21:08,600
It's okay.

1291
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:10,650
I'll fix the shrine for you.

1292
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:18,190
PEE NAK SHRINE

1293
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:26,270
It's fixed.

1294
01:21:31,730 --> 01:21:34,190
Tomorrow,
the three of us will be ordained.

1295
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:37,900
I would like to dedicate
my ordainment to Phorn

1296
01:21:38,650 --> 01:21:40,100
on your behalf.

1297
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,270
He will be ordained for you.

1298
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,150
We would like you

1299
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:50,770
to forgive us

1300
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:53,350
for everything we've done in the past.

1301
01:22:01,270 --> 01:22:02,730
-Mister.
-Yes.

1302
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:04,980
I would like to return

1303
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,150
this Nak Prok pendant to Nak Non.

1304
01:22:08,270 --> 01:22:09,520
I see. Okay.

1305
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:10,980
I'll hold it for you.

1306
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:20,900
Do you feel better now?

1307
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:21,980
That's good.

1308
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:24,190
You should get some rest.

1309
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:25,730
Your ordainment is tomorrow, isn't it?

1310
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:30,190
As for Phorn,

1311
01:22:30,350 --> 01:22:31,810
I'll take care of her.

1312
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:35,190
-I respectfully request the sangha
-I respectfully request the sangha

1313
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:37,810
-for the third time to ordain me
-for the third time to ordain me

1314
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:39,480
-as a monk.
-as a monk.

1315
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:42,020
-I beg the sangha out of compassion
-I beg the sangha out of compassion

1316
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:44,940
-to lift me up from the status
-to lift me up from the status

1317
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:46,650
-of a nak.
-of a nak.

1318
01:22:51,730 --> 01:22:52,980
We finally got it right.

1319
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,150
It will finally be over soon.

1320
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:11,020
I can't wait for tomorrow.

1321
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:14,770
Listen.

1322
01:23:14,850 --> 01:23:16,480
If we get ordained,

1323
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:19,020
the curse that has been going on here

1324
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:21,020
will end.

1325
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:27,190
Oh, right.

1326
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:31,100
Balloon.

1327
01:23:31,850 --> 01:23:32,900
Nong.

1328
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:35,230
I have something to tell you.

1329
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:40,600
My dad will come tomorrow.

1330
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,480
Did your dad finally accept who you are?

1331
01:23:45,650 --> 01:23:46,850
I guess so.

1332
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,060
This ordainment

1333
01:23:51,150 --> 01:23:52,400
is the only thing

1334
01:23:53,650 --> 01:23:55,650
that makes my dad proud of me.

1335
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,520
What about you?

1336
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:03,190
You people have daddy issues.

1337
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:06,400
I don't know.

1338
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,520
I didn't invite him.

1339
01:24:09,730 --> 01:24:12,230
But he knows that I came to get ordained.

1340
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:14,940
If he wants to come, he'll show up.

1341
01:24:17,980 --> 01:24:19,440
Where's the bell ringing coming from?

1342
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,270
Oh, I know.

1343
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:34,520
It must be that ice-cream man.

1344
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:37,440
Let me scold him once
before I get ordained.

1345
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:42,480
Let me enjoy this moment scolding him.

1346
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:48,230
Wait.

1347
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:51,650
Isn't it too late for anyone
to be selling ice-cream?

1348
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:10,730
What's he looking at?

1349
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:13,560
Look at him.

1350
01:25:21,730 --> 01:25:22,770
Balloon.

1351
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:25,150
What's wrong?

1352
01:25:27,810 --> 01:25:28,980
Are you okay?

1353
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:32,060
Did you fall asleep?

1354
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:34,400
Oh, my god.

1355
01:25:38,310 --> 01:25:40,810
What the hell is going on? Oh, my god.

1356
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:43,600
Fuck. What now?

1357
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:45,980
It's the Nak Prok pendant.

1358
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:48,100
Take it back. It's yours.

1359
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,940
Do you think I would let you go so easily?

1360
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:55,150
Nak Non.

1361
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:56,770
What is it that you want?

1362
01:25:57,020 --> 01:25:58,020
Please tell us.

1363
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,730
You can't give it to me.

1364
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:01,520
I don't care.

1365
01:26:02,350 --> 01:26:03,650
You must die.

1366
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:05,150
I told you.

1367
01:26:05,230 --> 01:26:06,270
-Nong.
-Shit.

1368
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,270
Nong. Oh, no.

1369
01:26:08,350 --> 01:26:10,230
-The ghost is here.
-Shit.

1370
01:26:10,310 --> 01:26:12,520
I'm sorry. Gosh!

1371
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,600
Nong, what's going on?

1372
01:26:14,690 --> 01:26:15,770
It won't open.

1373
01:26:15,850 --> 01:26:17,310
I will kill you all.

1374
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:22,480
Hello.

1375
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,560
Hello, my ass. This isn't the time.

1376
01:26:24,770 --> 01:26:26,520
-Oh, my god.
-Help us, Novice.

1377
01:26:26,650 --> 01:26:27,650
Come here.

1378
01:26:27,730 --> 01:26:29,400
-Help.
-What is it?

1379
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:31,270
What happened?

1380
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:33,770
Novice, do you know
how to perform an exorcism?

1381
01:26:33,850 --> 01:26:36,020
No, I don't.

1382
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:37,150
We're screwed.

1383
01:26:37,730 --> 01:26:40,150
You must do it. Balloon's possessed.

1384
01:26:40,230 --> 01:26:42,810
You're our only hope. Go and face him.

1385
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:43,850
-Help us.
-Oh, my god.

1386
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:46,190
I'm a novice, not one of the X-Men.

1387
01:26:46,270 --> 01:26:48,400
Is this time to fucking joke around?

1388
01:26:49,350 --> 01:26:50,900
I'm sorry.

1389
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:53,440
-Novice, go in there.
-You're our only hope.

1390
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,480
That's enough.

1391
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:56,850
Stop.

1392
01:26:57,900 --> 01:26:59,020
Fine.

1393
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:18,850
I'm sorry.

1394
01:27:20,230 --> 01:27:21,730
Shit.

1395
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:31,650
How dare you throw up in my face?

1396
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:34,150
I'll beat you up when you wake up.

1397
01:27:42,810 --> 01:27:44,770
If what Nak Non wants is to get ordained,

1398
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:48,980
why don't we do it for him?

1399
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:52,150
Right, First?

1400
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:57,230
It's already weird enough that a gay man
like me wants to get ordained.

1401
01:27:58,350 --> 01:27:59,850
Will you ordain a ghost too now?

1402
01:28:02,730 --> 01:28:03,600
Yes.

1403
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:08,270
Novice.

1404
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:12,020
As we are speaking, his body

1405
01:28:12,230 --> 01:28:14,310
is being kept in the old chapel
behind the temple.

1406
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:24,350
Oh, my god.

1407
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:25,400
Nong.

1408
01:28:37,230 --> 01:28:38,230
Shit.

1409
01:28:43,770 --> 01:28:44,850
-Aod.
-Yes.

1410
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:46,770
Bring the ordaining equipment
from the shrine.

1411
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:49,230
You and I will bring Balloon here.
Let's go.

1412
01:28:49,310 --> 01:28:50,190
Let's go, Nong.

1413
01:28:50,270 --> 01:28:51,980
Wait, everyone.

1414
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:54,270
I'm sorry.

1415
01:28:56,980 --> 01:28:58,190
But what about me?

1416
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:00,850
You can watch the body.

1417
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,310
What?

1418
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:05,480
Balloon.

1419
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:09,850
-Balloon.
-Do we pick him up?

1420
01:29:09,940 --> 01:29:12,020
-What the fuck did you tie me with?
-Let's do it.

1421
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:13,020
Gosh.

1422
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:14,060
Pick him up.

1423
01:29:14,650 --> 01:29:17,230
Hold still, Nak Non.
I'm trying to help you.

1424
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:19,520
Nak Non, my butt. It's me, Balloon.

1425
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:20,850
What? Is that you, Balloon?

1426
01:29:21,650 --> 01:29:23,230
-Balloon.
-Let me go.

1427
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:26,850
When did Nak Non's spirit leave your body?

1428
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:27,980
What?

1429
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:29,270
Was I possessed?

1430
01:29:29,350 --> 01:29:30,270
-Yes.
-Yes.

1431
01:29:30,350 --> 01:29:32,270
-Can you just untie me now?
-Okay.

1432
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:33,480
Hurry up.

1433
01:29:35,690 --> 01:29:36,980
-God.
-Ouch.

1434
01:29:37,060 --> 01:29:39,020
-Get me up.
-Who the hell was that?

1435
01:29:40,270 --> 01:29:42,270
-Get me up.
-Aod, watch where you're going.

1436
01:29:44,020 --> 01:29:46,520
-I'm very fragile.
-Untie me. What the hell is this?

1437
01:29:47,810 --> 01:29:49,350
Shit. Guys.

1438
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,020
Did you get scared again?

1439
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:53,230
The body is gone.

1440
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,850
The body is gone.

1441
01:29:58,100 --> 01:29:59,150
What body?

1442
01:29:59,650 --> 01:30:01,600
What? Where did Novice go?

1443
01:30:02,350 --> 01:30:03,350
You're right.

1444
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:04,600
Novice.

1445
01:30:04,690 --> 01:30:05,940
-Novice.
-Where did he go?

1446
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,270
-Novice.
-I'm here!

1447
01:30:10,850 --> 01:30:14,150
Novice, I told you to watch the body.
What are you doing over there?

1448
01:30:14,810 --> 01:30:16,980
Well, the body isn't over there,

1449
01:30:17,730 --> 01:30:19,350
but it's here.

1450
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:20,480
What the hell?

1451
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:21,690
Shit.

1452
01:30:21,770 --> 01:30:23,150
-Novice.
-What?

1453
01:30:23,230 --> 01:30:25,150
-What's going on, Novice?
-Novice.

1454
01:30:28,230 --> 01:30:29,270
-Novice.
-Novice.

1455
01:30:31,350 --> 01:30:32,400
Guys.

1456
01:30:32,730 --> 01:30:33,980
Help me.

1457
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:36,310
I can't breathe.

1458
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:39,270
Where are you dragging me to?

1459
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:41,600
Oh, shit.

1460
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:42,810
Guys.

1461
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:44,350
-Guys.
-Oh, no.

1462
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:47,060
-Guys.
-What should we do?

1463
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:48,650
Hurry and help him.

1464
01:30:48,730 --> 01:30:49,730
-Aod.
-Nong.

1465
01:30:49,810 --> 01:30:50,900
Guys.

1466
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:52,940
Nong, help him.

1467
01:30:53,020 --> 01:30:54,560
Say something.

1468
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:57,060
Tell him to let Novice go, Nong.

1469
01:30:57,150 --> 01:30:58,730
-Guys.
-What do you want me to say?

1470
01:30:58,810 --> 01:31:01,230
Nong, say what the fuck you want.
Just say something. Hurry.

1471
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:02,440
Let me think.

1472
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:04,770
-Hurry.
-Hurry. Novice is dying, Nong.

1473
01:31:04,850 --> 01:31:06,100
He is dying.

1474
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:07,730
I know. Just let me think.

1475
01:31:07,810 --> 01:31:09,520
Can you think any faster?

1476
01:31:10,150 --> 01:31:12,600
-Hurry, Nong.
-Novice, are you okay?

1477
01:31:12,940 --> 01:31:14,190
Ordainment...

1478
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,650
Nak Non.

1479
01:31:17,770 --> 01:31:18,940
Let him go

1480
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:20,270
if you want to get ordained.

1481
01:31:34,940 --> 01:31:36,560
If you don't keep your word,

1482
01:31:38,270 --> 01:31:39,520
you die.

1483
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:40,940
Nong.

1484
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:43,730
Are you negotiating with him

1485
01:31:44,270 --> 01:31:46,190
or challenging him?

1486
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,350
-Novice.
-Novice.

1487
01:31:58,520 --> 01:31:59,480
Novice.

1488
01:32:00,690 --> 01:32:02,560
Please get it done for us. Do it.

1489
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:03,980
-Wait.
-Novice.

1490
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:05,400
What do you want me to do?

1491
01:32:05,730 --> 01:32:06,650
What?

1492
01:32:06,810 --> 01:32:08,020
Ordain him.

1493
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:10,900
Guys, I'm a novice, not a monk.

1494
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:12,520
I can't ordain anybody.

1495
01:32:13,230 --> 01:32:14,520
Nong.

1496
01:32:14,650 --> 01:32:17,020
What were you thinking?
A novice ordaining someone as a monk?

1497
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:19,020
We are fucked. I already gave him my word.

1498
01:32:20,150 --> 01:32:21,770
You go, then.

1499
01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:24,020
No.

1500
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:26,230
His legs...

1501
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:31,440
Do something. First, think of something.

1502
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:32,650
First, think of something.

1503
01:32:32,730 --> 01:32:34,150
Do something, First.

1504
01:32:34,650 --> 01:32:35,730
I figured out a way!

1505
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,270
You guys came to the right person.

1506
01:32:40,730 --> 01:32:41,730
Don't worry.

1507
01:32:42,650 --> 01:32:44,270
I'll take care of him.

1508
01:32:44,850 --> 01:32:46,520
Are you sure this will work?

1509
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:51,350
We will have to roll with it.

1510
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:02,810
Is this the ghost

1511
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:05,850
that scared me the other day?

1512
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:10,650
Novice.

1513
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:12,690
Back up, Novice.

1514
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:15,150
He's coming closer. Back up.

1515
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:17,730
Stay right there.

1516
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:22,480
Can you ordain me?

1517
01:33:24,690 --> 01:33:25,850
His tone...

1518
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:28,230
Is this a favor or a threat?

1519
01:33:29,150 --> 01:33:30,020
All right.

1520
01:33:30,190 --> 01:33:31,520
Where's the equipment?

1521
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:32,850
Here.

1522
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:35,440
These are Nak Non's alms bowl
and talipot fan.

1523
01:33:36,650 --> 01:33:37,770
Where's the robe?

1524
01:33:38,270 --> 01:33:39,520
Here's the robe.

1525
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:42,850
-Oh, no.
-What?

1526
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:44,600
Where's the robe?

1527
01:33:44,690 --> 01:33:46,940
-Aod!
-Aod, where did it go?

1528
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:49,150
-Where did it go?
-I don't know.

1529
01:33:49,230 --> 01:33:50,980
If you don't have the robe, then I'm out.

1530
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:54,020
Come on. Don't leave, Luang Na.

1531
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:55,650
Luang Na.

1532
01:33:56,270 --> 01:33:57,230
Aod!

1533
01:33:57,310 --> 01:33:59,440
Where did you put it? Find it right now.

1534
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,400
The robe.

1535
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:03,980
The robe is here.

1536
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:06,850
The robe is here.

1537
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:12,350
Here's the robe.

1538
01:34:46,350 --> 01:34:47,350
Here.

1539
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:50,480
Here's your robe.

1540
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,560
I will finally get ordained for you.

1541
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:06,020
All right.

1542
01:35:20,350 --> 01:35:21,400
Do you know

1543
01:35:21,850 --> 01:35:23,270
how to cite the chant?

1544
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,350
Yes.

1545
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:27,400
In that case,

1546
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,440
please cite a few lines for me.

1547
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:33,270
Okay.

1548
01:35:33,730 --> 01:35:35,020
Do you have bronchiectasis?

1549
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:38,440
No, I don't.

1550
01:35:39,230 --> 01:35:40,770
Do you have epilepsy?

1551
01:35:42,020 --> 01:35:43,650
No, I don't.

1552
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:45,900
Are you a human being?

1553
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:51,810
Are you a human being?

1554
01:35:57,310 --> 01:35:58,770
I'm not human.

1555
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:02,980
But I would like to be ordained

1556
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:07,230
if you would be kind enough...

1557
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:10,900
If you would be kind...

1558
01:36:15,730 --> 01:36:17,310
I cannot ordain you.

1559
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:18,770
What?

1560
01:36:18,850 --> 01:36:20,440
Because you are not human.

1561
01:36:21,850 --> 01:36:23,400
Those who can be ordained

1562
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:25,100
must be human.

1563
01:36:32,690 --> 01:36:34,230
If I don't get to be ordained,

1564
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:39,230
then nobody will.

1565
01:36:43,770 --> 01:36:44,690
Oh, no.

1566
01:36:46,770 --> 01:36:48,150
Nak.

1567
01:36:48,270 --> 01:36:51,270
Nak, please calm down. Luang Na!

1568
01:36:51,350 --> 01:36:52,270
Luang Na.

1569
01:36:52,350 --> 01:36:53,850
Luang Na.

1570
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:56,100
-Is he possessed?
-Oh, my god. Luang Na!

1571
01:36:56,190 --> 01:36:58,020
Well, no...

1572
01:36:58,150 --> 01:36:59,600
He's not possessed.

1573
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:01,020
I...

1574
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:02,650
I'm sorry.

1575
01:37:02,770 --> 01:37:04,480
-I...
-What is it, Novice?

1576
01:37:04,810 --> 01:37:06,650
I ran out of data.

1577
01:37:06,730 --> 01:37:07,940
-What?
-Gosh?

1578
01:37:08,020 --> 01:37:10,850
-Why didn't you buy extra data?
-What's your problem?

1579
01:37:12,100 --> 01:37:13,770
What's your problem?

1580
01:37:13,850 --> 01:37:15,190
-First.
-What?

1581
01:37:16,690 --> 01:37:18,770
Shit!

1582
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:21,400
Non.

1583
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:23,020
Non.

1584
01:37:23,730 --> 01:37:25,100
Non, please don't.

1585
01:37:25,650 --> 01:37:26,690
Non.

1586
01:37:28,810 --> 01:37:30,270
If I don't get to be ordained,

1587
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:33,850
they must die.

1588
01:37:35,810 --> 01:37:37,020
That's enough, Non.

1589
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,600
Please don't hurt people anymore.

1590
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:43,270
Non.

1591
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,650
Nak Non.

1592
01:37:48,850 --> 01:37:50,730
You believe in the Phaya Nak, right?

1593
01:37:52,350 --> 01:37:54,400
Then please be like the nak.

1594
01:37:55,650 --> 01:37:58,190
Please accept the fact
that you cannot get ordained.

1595
01:38:08,270 --> 01:38:09,940
Enough already, Non.

1596
01:38:10,810 --> 01:38:12,060
I let it go.

1597
01:38:15,850 --> 01:38:17,730
Your yellow robe

1598
01:38:18,850 --> 01:38:20,400
isn't as important

1599
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:23,440
as you leaving in peace.

1600
01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:28,350
Do you hear me, son?

1601
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:32,270
Non.

1602
01:39:02,230 --> 01:39:03,600
Nong, come here.

1603
01:39:03,690 --> 01:39:04,730
Did the ghost listen?

1604
01:39:24,270 --> 01:39:26,020
My poor Non.

1605
01:39:36,150 --> 01:39:37,770
My child.

1606
01:39:39,850 --> 01:39:42,270
If I get to be reincarnated as a human,

1607
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:47,150
can I be born as your child again?

1608
01:39:58,730 --> 01:40:00,600
Of course, you can.

1609
01:40:18,350 --> 01:40:19,600
My child.

1610
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:45,560
Could I have Non's robe?

1611
01:40:45,730 --> 01:40:47,560
I will get ordained on his behalf.

1612
01:40:57,650 --> 01:40:58,520
First,

1613
01:40:59,230 --> 01:41:00,690
this ordainment

1614
01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:03,480
will make a military man like your father

1615
01:41:03,690 --> 01:41:06,520
proud of a beautiful gay son like you.

1616
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:11,350
This yellow piece of cloth
will send your dad to heaven

1617
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:13,230
faster than taking a jet plane.

1618
01:41:27,310 --> 01:41:29,440
Can you stop fooling yourself?

1619
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:31,650
You're gay. You don't have a uterus.

1620
01:41:31,770 --> 01:41:32,940
Shouldn't you save this money

1621
01:41:33,150 --> 01:41:35,060
for your future?

1622
01:41:36,730 --> 01:41:39,230
To be honest, I came here to get ordained

1623
01:41:40,850 --> 01:41:42,150
for my mother.

1624
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:46,310
I want to do something for her

1625
01:41:48,770 --> 01:41:50,270
even though she isn't with me anymore.

1626
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:33,600
Do you have dermatophytosis?

1627
01:42:33,690 --> 01:42:35,060
-No, I don't.
-No, I don't.

1628
01:42:35,190 --> 01:42:36,440
Do you have bronchiectasis?

1629
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:37,770
-No, I don't.
-No, I don't.

1630
01:42:37,850 --> 01:42:39,520
Do you have epilepsy?

1631
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:40,940
-No, I don't.
-No, I don't.

1632
01:42:41,020 --> 01:42:43,060
Are you a human being?

1633
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:46,400
-Yes, I am.
-Yes, I am.

1634
01:42:48,310 --> 01:42:50,310
Let's make some merit.

1635
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:53,400
Shall we make some merit?
We're already here. We must.

1636
01:42:55,310 --> 01:42:57,400
Wow. Look at those yellow robes.

1637
01:42:57,480 --> 01:42:59,270
All three of them got ordained together.

1638
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:04,690
Give it to him.

1639
01:43:05,310 --> 01:43:06,350
Nak.

1640
01:43:07,730 --> 01:43:10,520
-My dear.
-All right. Everything turned out okay.

1641
01:43:10,730 --> 01:43:11,850
My dear.

1642
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:29,520
The curse of Nak Non is finally over.

1643
01:43:29,650 --> 01:43:30,850
By the way, Luang Pee,

1644
01:43:31,810 --> 01:43:32,770
Luang Loong said

1645
01:43:32,850 --> 01:43:35,020
Luang Por wasn't harmed by Nak Non.

1646
01:43:35,770 --> 01:43:37,350
He died of natural causes.

1647
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:42,150
Oh, right. Aod.

1648
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:43,350
Yes.

1649
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:44,770
I want you to keep this.

1650
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:47,980
Keep it as a reminder that one day,

1651
01:43:48,850 --> 01:43:50,400
you will get ordained for your grandpa.

1652
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:54,060
Thank you.

1653
01:43:56,690 --> 01:43:59,310
Stay as a monk for three phansa like us.

1654
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:00,440
What?

1655
01:44:01,980 --> 01:44:02,850
You...

1656
01:44:03,150 --> 01:44:05,600
What did you just say? Three phansa?

1657
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:09,730
Three phansa means three months.

1658
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:13,980
Three phansa isn't three months! I...

1659
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:27,060
One phansa is three months.

1660
01:44:27,270 --> 01:44:29,350
But three phansa means three years!

1661
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:36,400
Look.

1662
01:44:36,770 --> 01:44:39,730
I thought we were here to fulfill the vow,
not to get enlightened.

1663
01:44:43,900 --> 01:44:45,060
Please calm down.

1664
01:44:45,150 --> 01:44:46,690
Stop the car.

1665
01:44:47,770 --> 01:44:49,060
-Aod.
-Yes.

1666
01:44:49,150 --> 01:44:50,270
Where's your grandpa?

1667
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:51,980
He's at the crematory. What's going on?

1668
01:44:52,060 --> 01:44:53,350
This is Luang Ta Gorn's body.

1669
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:54,730
He used to stay at this temple.

1670
01:44:54,810 --> 01:44:55,940
He passed away.

1671
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:58,480
By the way, did you know

1672
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,850
he passed away one day
before leaving the monkhood?

1673
01:45:01,650 --> 01:45:04,020
I'll send him to your grandpa then.

1674
01:45:04,350 --> 01:45:05,400
Let's go.

1675
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:12,900
Could it be the curse?

1676
01:45:13,770 --> 01:45:15,230
What curse now?

1677
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:18,480
In this temple,

1678
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:21,480
besides the curse of the nak
who can never become a monk,

1679
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:24,520
there's also another curse that
monks can never leave the monkhood.

1680
01:45:25,270 --> 01:45:26,600
Those who want to leave the monkhood

1681
01:45:26,730 --> 01:45:28,190
all end up dead.

1682
01:45:29,900 --> 01:45:31,020
Jeez!

1683
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:35,650
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

1684
01:45:35,980 --> 01:45:37,520
Come on, Luang Pee.

1685
01:45:37,810 --> 01:45:38,850
You saw it.

1686
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:40,560
I was busy running away
from ghosts with you.

1687
01:45:40,650 --> 01:45:42,190
Who would have thought about this?

1688
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:45,100
Novice.

1689
01:45:46,020 --> 01:45:48,270
Can no one help us at all?

1690
01:45:49,270 --> 01:45:50,230
Luang Pee.

1691
01:45:50,770 --> 01:45:52,900
The whole Marvel team

1692
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:54,850
wouldn't even be able to help you.

1693
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:56,440
Well,

1694
01:45:56,650 --> 01:45:58,060
you will be here for three phansa.

1695
01:45:59,060 --> 01:46:01,100
You have a lot of time to solve this case.

1696
01:46:02,730 --> 01:46:04,270
Stay here with me for a long time.

1697
01:46:13,270 --> 01:46:14,270
Here we go again.

1698
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:29,400
-Oh, no.
-Aod.

1699
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:30,350
Aod.

1700
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:31,480
Aod.

1701
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:57,150
What are you smiling at?

1702
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:00,310
After you.

1703
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:09,810
You're not so pretty.

1704
01:47:18,230 --> 01:47:20,190
Don't look at me, honey. Just let me go.

1705
01:47:25,900 --> 01:47:27,350
So that's what happened.

1706
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:28,310
What?

1707
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:32,230
He just wants to hit you.

1708
01:47:36,150 --> 01:47:37,310
Have you said cut yet?

1709
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:40,980
-It's making noise.
-Guys.

1710
01:47:41,060 --> 01:47:42,730
Hurry up.

1711
01:47:42,810 --> 01:47:43,730
Hurry up.

1712
01:47:45,810 --> 01:47:46,980
Oh, no.

1713
01:47:47,060 --> 01:47:47,940
Shit.

1714
01:47:49,020 --> 01:47:52,190
Didn't you research
how scary this place was?

1715
01:47:55,940 --> 01:47:56,850
You bitch.

1716
01:47:59,270 --> 01:48:00,150
Go!

1717
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:02,270
Oh, no. He fell.

1718
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:04,440
He's safe. It's okay.

1719
01:48:06,850 --> 01:48:08,900
Take a look at him.

1720
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:11,810
-I can't. It's too hot.
-Bring a fan.

1721
01:48:11,900 --> 01:48:13,230
-Okay.
-That's enough.

1722
01:48:13,310 --> 01:48:14,770
-Don't gather around.
-Come.

1723
01:48:14,850 --> 01:48:15,810
Jui.

1724
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:17,150
-Why didn't--
-Help.

1725
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:19,770
I know...

1726
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:25,400
Oh, my god.

1727
01:48:25,850 --> 01:48:28,100
-Help!
-Won't you say cut?

1728
01:48:28,190 --> 01:48:30,730
If I don't get to be ordained,
then no one will.

1729
01:48:30,810 --> 01:48:31,850
Cut. Luang Por.

1730
01:48:31,940 --> 01:48:34,060
Luang Por, you are not dead yet.
Wait until I finish talking.

1731
01:48:34,150 --> 01:48:35,020
I see.

1732
01:48:36,940 --> 01:48:38,400
Wait until I finish talking.

1733
01:48:51,350 --> 01:48:53,350
