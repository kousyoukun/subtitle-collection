00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,833
I would like to take the opportunity
to pay homage to the Gautama Buddha.

4
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:19,125
I am begging you
to forgive me for all of my sins.

5
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:24,666
Please rejoice in my merit.

6
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:29,666
And you have made great merit,
please share it with me.

7
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:35,041
Sadhu. I rejoice in your merit.

8
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,208
Fuck.

9
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,666
Shit.

10
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:52,791
Help!

11
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,083
Help!

12
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,291
Help!

THUMMANAKANIMIT TEMPLE

14
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,500
Hurry up.

15
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,333
The last bus to Bangkae and Tha Phra

16
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,500
is about to leave.

17
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:33,833
You better hurry.

18
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,625
Wait for us.

19
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,000
-Wait for us.
-Let's go.

20
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,625
Oh, my god.

21
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,375
-What's with your hat?
-Please speed up.

22
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,416
Shit.

23
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,625
Tell me beforehand next time
if you will dress up like this.

24
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,750
Just think of it as a trip to Milan.

25
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,916
Oh, my god. What kind of ride is that?

26
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,041
Stop acting like a princess, First.

27
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,541
Hey.

28
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:01,958
It's cold up here.

29
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,291
It's so easy to breathe.

30
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:05,416
Balloon.

31
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,375
I'm glad that

32
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,291
you won the lottery. However,

33
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,166
did you give your boyfriend the car
to drive to Bangkok when I was asleep?

34
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,458
Just because he forgot to feed the dog?

35
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:16,708
Guys,

36
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,500
my boyfriend's dog is pitiful.

37
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,875
If it doesn't get to eat...

38
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,208
Hey.

39
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,666
Is your boyfriend's dog
more important than your friends?

40
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,041
I told you to rent a private car,
but you wouldn't listen.

41
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,750
Is the car under your boyfriend's name?

42
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,250
Did you transfer the ownership to him?

43
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,958
No. Are you crazy?

44
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,708
I would never transfer
the ownership to him.

45
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:35,916
You bitch.

46
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,291
You already did, didn't you?

47
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,791
What's wrong?

48
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,458
What's wrong? Calm down.

49
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,083
I'm sorry.

50
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,291
Her epilepsy is acting up.

51
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,333
He's so handsome.

52
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,083
Over there.

53
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,958
Leave it to me.

54
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,375
-Guys.
-What?

55
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,000
-How is he?
-He's handsome.

56
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,083
Hello. My name is Balloon.

57
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,833
-Right.
-Guys, come here quick.

58
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,291
-Pongsit!
-Pongsit!

59
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Yes, it's me.

60
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,041
BANGKOK TO NAKHON PATHOM

61
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,625
-What?
-Keep walking straight.

62
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,000
Have a safe trip.

63
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,000
Guys.

64
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,375
Keep it down.

65
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,875
Guys, I miss the time
when we were in university.

66
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,208
Do you remember?
I hadn't seen you for a long time though.

67
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,333
How have you been?

68
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,416
I was fine at first
but now that I'm here with you--

69
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,583
You must feel even better now.

70
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,333
So, can you tell me

71
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,875
where you work now?

72
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,416
I just got fired.

73
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,250
People say it's because of my unlucky age,

74
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,083
but I think it's nonsense.

75
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:09,916
Your unlucky age?

76
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,333
Are you 25 years old now?

77
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,250
Yes, I turned 25 years old today.

78
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:14,750
Guys.

79
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,458
It's his birthday today.

80
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:17,958
One, two, three.

81
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,958
<i>-Happy birthday to you</i>
-Poon.

82
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:20,916
-Yes?
-Keep it down.

83
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,250
Please tell them to shut it.

84
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,791
-Okay.
<i>-Happy birthday</i>

85
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:25,791
<i>-To you</i>
-Hey.

86
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,250
<i>Happy birthday...</i>

87
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,916
-Stop.
<i>-Happy birthday to you</i>

88
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,416
-Poon.
-Stop already.

89
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,833
Don't go yet. Come here.

90
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,916
-What is it?
-Look at it. Do you see it?

91
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,500
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

92
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,791
-Do you?
-I don't see anything.

93
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,333
<i>-Happy birthday to you</i>
-You don't? What are you looking at?

94
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,666
-Look in the mirror, not the road.
<i>-Happy birthday to you</i>

95
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,125
-The mirror.
<i>-Happy birthday...</i>

96
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,916
I don't see anything.

97
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,875
-Then, let's look at it together.
<i>-Happy birthday to you</i>

98
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:55,333
-Okay.
<i>-Happy birthday to you</i>

99
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,000
Oh, my god. The driver fainted.

100
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,166
-Oh, no.
-Oh, no.

101
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,666
Oh, no. What should we do?

102
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,083
Got, it has to be you.

103
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,791
-What should we do?
-You can drive it, Got.

104
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,291
-I can't.
-Pull yourself together.

105
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,458
Go right now.

106
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,958
Calm down. Got...

107
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,250
-Does he even know how to drive?
-Fuck. Eyes on the road.

108
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,375
Right.

109
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,583
Right.

110
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,458
I'm trying.

111
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,083
-Got.
-Balloon, help me drive this thing.

112
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,041
Guys, I don't want to die today.

113
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,750
BANGKOK TO NAKHON PATHOM

114
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,541
The patient is safe now.

115
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:53,708
Nong.

116
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,500
How do you feel, Nong?

117
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:00,708
Nong.

118
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,000
Got is dead.

119
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:15,791
Got.

120
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,333
Nong.

121
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,750
<i>You can't say the accident
happened because of fate.</i>

122
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,708
What about the people who died?

123
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,083
What did they have to do with it?

124
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,875
What about Balloon and First?

125
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,083
What did they do?

126
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,500
Why did this happen to them?

127
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,625
You can call me superstitious.

128
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,208
Or do you want to die like your friend?

129
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,791
So must I be ordained

130
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,166
to make my life better?

131
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,000
I won't get hit by a car
if I walk on the expressway.

132
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,250
I won't get burnt if I walk on fire.
Is that what you want?

133
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,333
Would I be a monk or an Avenger?

134
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:50,916
Nong.

135
00:09:58,625 --> 00:09:59,583
Everyone.

136
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,666
Wait for me in there.

137
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,291
Did you see the person
who just went inside?

138
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,458
You know,

139
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,791
he isn't half

140
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,541
as lucky as you

141
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,250
because his parents

142
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,416
passed away before he could be ordained.

143
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,250
He has nothing to do with me.

144
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,666
I don't think getting ordained
is important at all.

145
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,166
Doesn't the importance

146
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,458
rely on the person getting ordained?

147
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,333
Would it have been important
if it was your mother

148
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,458
who asked you to get ordained?

149
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:06,125
THUMMANAKANIMIT TEMPLE

150
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:18,583
<i>Who did you promise</i>

151
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,333
to get ordained for?

152
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,583
Who did we promise?

153
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,416
We never promised anyone.

154
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,166
I did.

155
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,708
I made a vow

156
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,666
that I would get ordained
if I won the lottery.

157
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,333
That's your problem.
It doesn't concern me.

158
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,500
It does.

159
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,583
<i>I vowed</i>

00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,083

<i>all three of us would get ordained.</i>

00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,166
<i>All three of us?</i>

<i>Balloon,</i>

164
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,833
you're gay.

165
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,708
How could you vow to get ordained?

166
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,458
I wasn't thinking.

167
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:03,750
You should have.

168
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,208
Luang Loong.

169
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,250
Yes?

170
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,750
-Since he already made the vow,
-Yes.

171
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,166
what should we do now, Luang Loong?

172
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,375
Fulfill your vow

173
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,416
at the place you made it.

174
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,625
This is the shrine
where First and I made the vow.

175
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,125
PEE NAK SHRINE

176
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,375
Here.

00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,583
Why are you giving it to me?

178
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:34,958
Keep it with you.

179
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,958
You will know

180
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,833

We are here to get ordained

184
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,708

185
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,583
Sadhu.

186
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:05,541
My god.

187
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,083
Hello, Luang Pee.

188
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,208
We are here to get ordained.

189
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,291
Balloon.

190
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,625
He's hot.

191
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,083
I don't mind being here for three <i>phansa</i>.

192
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:27,333
First.

193
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,000
You will never be lonely.

194
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,958
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

195
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:32,958
Hell will get you.

196
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,416
Are you jealous, Nong?

197
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,250
You just had to pick this temple.

198
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,041
Will I have Internet here?

199
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,541
-What the hell?
-Oh, no.

200
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,500
What's with her?

201
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,791
We're sorry.

202
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,833
Why did I apologize?

203
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,208
Should we beat her up?

204
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,916
Before you beat her up,

205
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,750
you should wake Nong up first.

206
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:11,958
Nong.

207
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,083
Nong, pull yourself together.

208
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,875
-Let go.
-Fine.

209
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,041
Look at me, honey.

210
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,083
Hey.

211
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:21,916
What are you doing here?

212
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,541
So, that's the story.

213
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,708
That's why all three of us
decided to get ordained here.

214
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,125
Miss.

215
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,250
Call me mister.

216
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,625
You're gay, right?

217
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,500
We are all straight men here.

218
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:37,958
How could you think we're gay?

219
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:39,625
Right, First?

220
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:40,666
Yes.

221
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,041
Hey, guys.

222
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,250
Keep it down.

223
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,541
Are you sure you want to
get ordained at this temple?

224
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,916
Please don't discriminate us.

225
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,708
We will get ordained
at this temple no matter what.

226
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,833
That's not the case.

227
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,333
If that's not the case,

228
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,666
then what's the problem here?

229
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,625
The problem is you are gay.

230
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,666
Aod.

231
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,916
Did it hurt, baby?

232
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:08,916
Aod.

233
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,791
Take these three to their sitter.

234
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,916
Bring chanting books too.

235
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,500
Yes, Luang Por.

236
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:22,875
Remove your nail color.

237
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,666
Your sitter

238
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:27,791
is very strict.

239
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,583
Aod, are we almost there?

240
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:31,666
Yes, we're here.

241
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,083
Are you the three people
who want to get ordained?

242
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:53,875
Luang Por

243
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,708
texted me just now.

244
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:01,875
So,

245
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,916
will you be our sitter?

246
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,250
Yes.

247
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,541
Will you be able to handle it?

248
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,166
Listen.

249
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:10,791
Can we get

250
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,291
a young and handsome monk?

251
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,291
Can we get the one we met at the shrine?

252
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,958
The monk with fair skin, huge biceps,

253
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,333
a high nose bridge, sweet eyes,

254
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,791
-and his face--
-Mister.

255
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,208
There isn't such a person.

256
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,000
In this temple,

257
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,875
Luang Por, the abbot,
is the only monk here.

258
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,625
Besides him, this novice and I

259
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,041
are the best looking ones.

260
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,916
-Then the person I met--
-Everyone,

261
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,541
I'll take you to your rooms.

262
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,625
Come on, Aod.
We have a ceremony in the evening.

263
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,625
What about the hot monk over there?

264
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,500
Just follow me.
I don't know anyone like that.

265
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,125
I knew it. It's so heavy.
I just had to bring so much.

266
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,041
Oh, my god. Help me!

267
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:10,958
Oh, no.

268
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,625
Oh, no.

269
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,083
Oh, no.

270
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,250
Shit.

271
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,250
Luang Por.

272
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,291
Gosh.

273
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,791
There is a coffin!

274
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:04,958
-A gecko!
-First.

275
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,416
My room has a coffin, First.

276
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,458
First, my room has a coffin.

277
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:10,875
Talk to me...

278
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,250
What kind of person eats a fucking gecko?

279
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,583
It bit my lip.

280
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:18,875
You shithead.

281
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,500
-It's dirty.
-Damn it.

282
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:21,458
Bitch.

283
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,125
Wait.

284
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:24,875
What are you doing?

285
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,541
I'll get that gecko out of your lip.

286
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:27,666
What about my face?

287
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,666
Help me.

288
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,666
Stay still.

289
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,833
Stay still, okay?

290
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,208
One, two,

291
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,083
three.

292
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,583
Nong.

293
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,041
Nong.

294
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,083
Fuck.

295
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,291
-Shit.
-Nong.

296
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,041
First.

297
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,791
If you can get this snake off of me,

298
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,541
I'll let you touch my snake.

299
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:58,916
Are you serious?

300
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,166
Yes. Hurry up.

301
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,208
Gosh.

302
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:03,250
It's licking me. Hurry up.

303
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,250
All right.

304
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,000
First.

305
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,916
-Hurry.
-First, the head.

306
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,458
-I'll pee my pants.
-It's looking at you.

307
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:10,791
-Be careful.
-I'll pee my pants.

308
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,208
The tail, First. Watch its tail.

309
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,166
First.

310
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,333
-Hurry.
-I can't.

311
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,791
Please do it. I can't take it anymore.

312
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:23,541
It's a freaking snake!

313
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:26,125
Get out, Nong. Get out.

314
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:27,166
I'm leaving.

315
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:29,500
Nong.

316
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,208
Gosh.

317
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,250
Oh, my god.

318
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:41,583
What's going on?

319
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:44,708
-So long.
-Hey, wait.

320
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,791
Take this. Here.

321
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:47,833
Here's 500 baht for you.

322
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,458
Get us a new room. Let us sleep together.

323
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:51,166
Move my things to the new room too.

324
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,208
Hey, wait.

325
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:53,333
We need help at the temple.

326
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:54,875
Yes, I know. I'll be there.

327
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,000
Gosh.

328
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,041
My god.

329
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,291
I can't do this anymore.

330
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:02,000
-Please take it from me.
-Oh, no. Don't.

331
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,208
Gosh.

332
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:07,041
First!

333
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,708
This is it.

334
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:17,250
You guys can sleep here.

335
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:19,791
It's big enough

336
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,250
for the three of you.

337
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:24,291
Aod.

338
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:27,125
Why did you bring them here?

339
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,583
They will be ordained soon.

340
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,500
They shouldn't be involved with funerals.

341
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,000
It's inauspicious.

342
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:42,500
That's right.

343
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,041
Well...

344
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:50,375
Luang Por,

345
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:53,375
I invited the monks from Sai Temple.

346
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:56,041
And I informed them that you were sick

347
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,666
and won't be joining today.

348
00:23:58,125 --> 00:23:59,458
Thank you so much.

349
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:02,416
Luang Por,

350
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:04,041
you should rest.

351
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:06,000
I'll take care of this end.

352
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,583
-Gosh.
-Thank you.

353
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:10,833
Gosh.

354
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,166
Wait.

355
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:27,416
Balloon.

356
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:29,083
-Come here.
-What now?

357
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:30,125
Come now.

358
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:32,250
He looks familiar.

359
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:33,791
Have we met him before?

360
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:35,791
Hang on.

361
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:42,458
How can he not look familiar?

362
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:44,333
He's lying right here.

363
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:45,875
Do you want to talk to him?

364
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:56,541
{\an8}JAKKAPONG WONGWALLEE, 25 YEARS OLD

365
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:05,916
<i>Jui doesn't have any relatives anymore.</i>

366
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,250
<i>Her parents recently passed away.</i>

367
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:10,833
<i>And now her brother too.</i>

368
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:16,750
Hello, I'm Nong.

369
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:19,166
Let me help with the funeral.

370
00:25:21,791 --> 00:25:22,708
Nong.

371
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:24,958
-What?
-Do you want a selfie stick?

372
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,041
You're sticking your face
all the way there.

373
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:28,208
Hey.

374
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:29,458
The monks are praying.

375
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:31,416
The monks are praying.

376
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:44,250
BORN

377
00:25:58,541 --> 00:26:00,125
Do you want a piece of me?

378
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:04,458
Aren't you afraid of monks at all?

379
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,666
All right then.

380
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:10,208
THUMMANAKANIMIT TEMPLE SCHOOL

381
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:44,958
I don't hear anything.

382
00:26:51,916 --> 00:26:52,750
What?

383
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:53,833
-Oh, my god.
-What happened?

384
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:56,250
Get the car ready. Get the car now.

385
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:57,541
Wait, Luang Pee.

386
00:26:57,625 --> 00:26:59,583
The ceremony isn't complete yet.

387
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:01,333
-Let's leave it here today. I'm busy.
-What?

388
00:27:01,416 --> 00:27:02,958
-We'll continue tomorrow.
-But...

389
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:04,708
-Wait.
-Why are you sitting there? Let's go.

390
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,125
-Wait.
-Wait for us.

391
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:10,083
Is it happening again?

392
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:17,500
PEE NAK SHRINE

393
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:19,833
Do you think

394
00:27:19,916 --> 00:27:21,833
something's off about this temple?

395
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:23,083
Balloon.

396
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:25,291
Did you just realize this?

397
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,625
I think

398
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:29,083
since we stepped inside the temple,

399
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:31,250
nothing was normal,

400
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:33,083
especially

401
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:34,791
that old man over there.

402
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:36,875
First!

403
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:39,375
You're too loud.
Did you want him to hear you?

404
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,208
Keep it down.

405
00:27:42,666 --> 00:27:44,041
First.

406
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:45,583
Balloon.

407
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,833
Thank you very much.

408
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:49,791
You are welcome.

409
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:50,958
What?

410
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,958
What are you thanking us for?

411
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:55,875
At first, I was going to stay
with the body alone tonight.

412
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:59,375
However, Nong said you guys volunteered
to stay here on my behalf

413
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:01,708
-What?
-because a girl staying here alone

414
00:28:01,791 --> 00:28:02,875
may not be

415
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:04,500
appropriate.

416
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:08,333
Fuck you.

417
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,041
Of course.

418
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,916
We will

419
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,375
take the best care of him. Don't worry.

420
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:17,333
First, you...

421
00:28:17,416 --> 00:28:18,916
-How can we sleep here?
-Thank you so much.

422
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,166
All right.

423
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:23,166
You idiot.

424
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:26,416
Why on earth did you agree
to stay with the body tonight, First?

425
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:28,916
It's Nong.

426
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,708
He sent me this sign.

427
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:34,333
You would do anything for a man.

428
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,916
Hello.

429
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,041
You are here with Balloon again.

430
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:45,875
We are live at a funeral.

431
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,750
So what? Who cares?

432
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:50,041
You're not even scared of your ugly face.

433
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:52,500
Those who are interested, please confirm.
We have a promotion today.

434
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:53,666
"You look prettier."

435
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,208
I'll give you a discount.

436
00:28:58,833 --> 00:28:59,833
"Hey,

437
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,208
I see a hand from the coffin."

438
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:06,333
Where?

439
00:29:06,416 --> 00:29:08,875
You guys are joking around
because you know I'm scared of ghosts.

440
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:11,666
I'm not scared even if I'm in a temple.
Don't try to fucking trick me.

441
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,750
You guys are at it.
Why are you typing so much?

442
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:18,000
I'm never scared of anything.
Let them come.

443
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:19,875
Let ten of them come.

444
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,541
Let's continue with our sales.

445
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:25,083
"It's even higher up now, sis."

446
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:26,750
Who's your sister?

447
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,291
Where?

448
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:35,875
Can it get any higher?

449
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:39,166
Stop trying to trick me.

450
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:41,166
Leave if you don't want to buy anything.

451
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,291
"The whole body is there."

452
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:55,875
He's here, isn't he?

453
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:06,625
First.

454
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,625
First.

455
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:18,666
Nong.

456
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:24,208
What the fuck?

457
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:27,375
First, Nong, guys!

458
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:37,875
What the hell is wrong with you?

459
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:40,541
-Oh, my god.
-What's with you? You scared me.

460
00:30:40,791 --> 00:30:41,791
The thought came to me.

461
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:43,208
What thought?

462
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:45,916
Look to my left.

463
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,541
{\an8}This photo.

464
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:49,875
What photo?

465
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:51,458
This photo. Think about it.

466
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:53,000
At the shrine.

467
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:54,625
What shrine?

468
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:57,458
The shrine we were at this evening.

469
00:30:57,666 --> 00:30:58,625
The handsome monk.

470
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:02,291
The handsome monk with the hot body.

471
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:04,291
The handsome monk?

472
00:31:04,916 --> 00:31:06,583
Stop drooling, bitch.

473
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:07,791
First.

474
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,041
Then who's in the coffin?

475
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:11,708
It's him. You dumbass.

476
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:13,333
You're calling me dumb again.

477
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:15,500
You are dumb. You wouldn't listen to me.

478
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,666
You didn't explain it to me, First.

479
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,708
I tried, but you kept pointing at things.
You wouldn't listen.

480
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:22,208
I'm not the only dumb one here, idiot.

481
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:25,083
Did you call me an idiot? How could you?

482
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:26,791
You wouldn't explain it to me properly.

483
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:27,833
I explained it to you.

484
00:31:27,916 --> 00:31:28,833
Shut up!

485
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:36,166
What have you done?

486
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,958
What the hell are you guys doing?

487
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:40,916
Hey. What the hell?

488
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:42,708
Hey, it's me.

489
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:43,833
It's me.

490
00:31:43,916 --> 00:31:45,958
Damn it, Nong.

491
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:48,083
Why would you put on a face mask?

492
00:31:48,166 --> 00:31:49,958
You put it on for me.

493
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:52,333
Why the fuck did you freak out then?

494
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:55,791
I'm sorry. I forgot.

495
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:59,416
Nong, we were haunted.

496
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,041
-It was so scary.
-What the hell have you done?

497
00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:03,833
Put the coffin back right now,

498
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:05,708
or we'll be scolded by Luang Por.

499
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:08,666
Aren't you holding onto me too tightly?

500
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:11,750
I'm scared, Nong.

501
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:13,583
Shit.

502
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:20,791
-Shit.
-What?

503
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:23,291
The body is gone.

504
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:25,708
The body is gone.

505
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:27,250
Are you sure, Nong?

506
00:32:27,416 --> 00:32:28,875
Look carefully.

507
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,458
Look at it.

508
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,750
What should we do?

509
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:40,208
Look behind the curtain.

510
00:32:53,916 --> 00:32:55,625
I'm not wearing my contact lens.
I can't see.

511
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:56,583
What?

512
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:00,000
Nong.

513
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,375
Nong.

514
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:02,458
What?

515
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:05,291
You left me.

516
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,083
First, you look at it.

517
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,541
My glasses are foggy. I can't see. Here.

518
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,541
What's wrong with you?

519
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:24,791
Guys, I can't see.

520
00:33:24,958 --> 00:33:26,416
You're not blind.

521
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:29,791
Fuck.

522
00:33:38,291 --> 00:33:40,416
I'm scared.

523
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:43,500
There's nothing to be scared of.

524
00:33:58,625 --> 00:33:59,875
Balloon, how was it?

525
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,666
-What happened?
-Balloon.

526
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:04,708
Hey. Balloon.

527
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:06,416
Balloon, don't.

528
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,500
I'm leaving.

529
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:09,791
Hey. Balloon.

530
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:12,000
Balloon, wait.

531
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:14,333
What's going on here?

532
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:16,000
Luang Por.

533
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:17,416
Luang Por.

534
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:22,750
The legend at this temple

535
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:24,500
is quite paranormal.

536
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
No one can never fully
become a monk at this temple.

537
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:29,791
-What?
-What?

538
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:32,083
In these past years,

539
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:33,916
people who came to get ordained

540
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:35,750
usually died at the stage of being a nak.

541
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:38,250
No one has successfully become a monk yet.

542
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:39,750
-Fuck.
-Fuck.

543
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,291
You didn't swear at me, did you?

544
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:44,208
I did.

545
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:45,750
Hey.

546
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:48,625
Please continue. I wasn't swearing at you.

547
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:50,583
People say

548
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:51,958
that the person who died

549
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:54,000
would come to find someone
to take his place.

550
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:55,708
<i>He would come to haunt</i>

551
00:34:55,916 --> 00:34:57,375
<i>and kill the next person.</i>

552
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:02,333
<i>Sometimes at night,</i>

553
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:05,291
<i>you would see a nak parade
heading to the temple</i>

554
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:07,416
<i>but no one</i>

555
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:09,416
<i>would have a head.</i>

556
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,041
<i>And the cheering</i>

557
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,291
<i>would turn into a painful moaning instead.</i>

558
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:21,000
<i>Therefore, everyone concludes that</i>

559
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:22,916
<i>people who get ordained at this temple</i>

560
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:25,541
will die mysteriously.

561
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:30,208
And they say the closer you are
to the ceremony,

562
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:32,583
the scarier it gets.

563
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:40,000
Oh, my god.

564
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:41,541
Balloon.

565
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:44,500
Did you not do a research
beforehand at all?

566
00:35:46,916 --> 00:35:48,041
Bitch.

567
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:51,208
You would have found out
that the temple is really haunted.

568
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,041
Novice,

569
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:54,833
then please let the three of us

570
00:35:55,833 --> 00:35:57,208
sleep with you tonight.

571
00:35:57,291 --> 00:35:58,166
What?

572
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:30,833
Wait for me.
My eyebrows are getting ruined, bitch.

573
00:36:30,916 --> 00:36:32,791
Is this the time?

574
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,250
Apply more powder.

575
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:36,291
Try it and you might be as pretty as me.

576
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:37,250
Hey.

577
00:36:37,458 --> 00:36:38,458
Keep it down.

578
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:40,125
Do I not have enough makeup, Nong?

579
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:42,333
Nong said I didn't have enough.

580
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:44,000
Your face is as thick as a boxer's face.

581
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:44,958
First.

582
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,041
Did the wound that gecko left you
disappear already?

583
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:51,166
Don't tell me you had a plastic surgeon
to Netflix and chill at the temple.

584
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,458
It doesn't concern you.

585
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:53,833
I did things my way.

586
00:36:55,041 --> 00:36:56,958
How do my eyebrows look right now?

587
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:02,250
Balloon.

588
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:05,541
Why would we need Arabica coffee

589
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:06,500
when we have

590
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:09,916
a hot guy like him to keep us awake?

591
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:12,000
Since we came,
I've only seen monks and ghosts.

592
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:13,833
I haven't seen any hot guys.

593
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:14,875
Which direction?

594
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:16,041
Your nine o'clock.

595
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:17,500
Nine o'clock.

596
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:23,541
Hottie.

597
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:26,125
How can gay men get ordained?

598
00:37:26,625 --> 00:37:28,958
They are going wild
just seeing a man taking a shower.

599
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:30,458
It's inappropriate.

600
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,291
Balloon, First, let's go.

601
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:35,125
-Let's go.
-This one.

602
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:36,833
What's this can?

603
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:39,416
-Let's go.
-First.

604
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,041
First.

605
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:42,291
What?

606
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:43,666
What's wrong?

607
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:44,916
-What's wrong?
-First.

608
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,916
Wait. Hold me. My back hurts.

609
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,125
-Let's go.
-Don't go yet.

610
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,250
It might go back to sleep.

611
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:54,083
Come on. Let's go inside.

612
00:37:54,791 --> 00:37:55,666
First.

613
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,916
Shall we kick their butts?

614
00:37:58,416 --> 00:37:59,708
How dare you insult me?

615
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:00,791
Damn them.

616
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:06,958
Is this your Nak Prok pendant?

617
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,750
Yes, it's mine.

618
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:15,208
Aod found it

619
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:17,583
when he was moving your things,

620
00:38:18,291 --> 00:38:19,541
but he forgot to give it back.

621
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:23,583
I've prepared your tuition fee.
Don't worry.

622
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:31,708
Did you transfer money to a guy again?

623
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,500
You're about to be ordained.

624
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:37,416
First,

625
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:39,291
I'm just here to fulfill my vow.

626
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:41,375
I'm not here to fucking get enlightened.

627
00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:44,416
Can you stop fooling yourself?

628
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:47,583
You're gay. You don't have a uterus.

629
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:49,666
Shouldn't you save this money

630
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:51,708
for your future?

631
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:55,333
Think about your disabled mother.

632
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:01,750
First.

633
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:03,083
What?

634
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:04,458
My mom isn't disabled.

635
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:05,666
That was Got's mother.

636
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:07,208
I forgot.

637
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:11,666
By the way, what has gotten into you?

638
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:17,791
Don't tell me
that you haven't told your dad

639
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:19,291
about ordaining.

640
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:23,000
We'll only be ordained for a short while.

641
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:25,208
It's not a big deal.

642
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:27,041
First,

643
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,166
this ordainment

644
00:39:29,583 --> 00:39:32,083
will make a military man like your father

645
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:35,250
proud of a beautiful gay son like you.

646
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:39,833
This yellow piece of cloth
will send your dad to heaven

647
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:41,833
faster than taking a jet plane.

648
00:39:44,708 --> 00:39:47,166
My dad wouldn't even let me

649
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:50,666
wear a skirt.

650
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,500
Would he be able to take it?

651
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,208
You haven't even tried telling him though.

652
00:40:07,291 --> 00:40:08,416
Do you have dermatophytosis?

653
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,375
-No, I don't.
-No, I don't.

654
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:11,583
Do you have bronchiectasis?

655
00:40:11,666 --> 00:40:13,166
-No, I don't.
-No, I don't.

656
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,541
Do you have epilepsy?

657
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:16,666
-No, I don't.
-No, I don't.

658
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:18,375
Are you a human being?

659
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,250
-Yes, I am.
-Yes, I am.

660
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:24,500
Look over there, human.

661
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:26,333
-Yes, I am.
-Yes, I am.

662
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:28,000
Hey, what's with that script?

663
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:29,208
Oh, shit.

664
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:30,666
What do you mean?

665
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,083
That ghost is out in daylight.
It's not afraid at all.

666
00:40:33,416 --> 00:40:34,500
Do you see it?

667
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,250
That's a human, not a ghost, Balloon.

668
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:42,375
-Thief!
-Thief!

669
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:44,666
Balloon. Hey...

670
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:47,000
You old hag, you can't steal things
from the temple.

671
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:48,958
You can't do that.

672
00:40:49,458 --> 00:40:51,208
Guys, what the hell?

673
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:53,666
-Guys, what's with her?
-What's wrong with her?

674
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,208
-Nong, what's wrong with her?
-What?

675
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:56,333
-Nong.
-Oh, my god.

676
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,291
What the hell?

677
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:01,875
-Nak.
-Nak?

678
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:02,833
Guys.

679
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:04,083
I'm not a nak.

680
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:05,500
Nong.

681
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:08,541
-Nak.
-Nong.

682
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:09,625
-What should we do?
-Guys.

683
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:10,875
-Nong.
-Guys.

684
00:41:10,958 --> 00:41:12,416
-Hey.
-No.

685
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,250
-Nak.
-Help me.

686
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:16,208
-Let my friend go, you psycho.
-Nak.

687
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:22,083
Guys, help me.

688
00:41:22,916 --> 00:41:24,791
He's mine.

689
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:25,791
Who said so?

690
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,166
-Oh, my god.
-Get out.

691
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,208
Hey, you!

692
00:41:29,916 --> 00:41:31,458
-Hey.
-Let go, old hag.

693
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:32,958
-Let him go.
-First.

694
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:35,541
-Miss.
-Nong.

695
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:37,166
Who is she?

696
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:39,208
You don't need to know.

697
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:42,208
You should just worry about yourselves.

698
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,708
Nak.

699
00:41:44,791 --> 00:41:47,250
-Let's go. That's not him.
-Nak.

700
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:49,375
-What?
-He's not a nak.

701
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:50,416
-He's not.
-Nak.

702
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,416
You psycho!

703
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,750
Who the hell is she?

704
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:56,333
Why does she act like she knows me?

705
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:57,333
Guys.

706
00:41:57,416 --> 00:41:58,416
I wonder the same.

707
00:41:58,541 --> 00:41:59,750
That old man too.

708
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:01,833
-He looks suspicious somehow.
-Guys.

709
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:04,416
Is this a temple
or a murder scene in <i>Conan</i>?

710
00:42:04,708 --> 00:42:06,375
There are so many mysterious characters.

711
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:07,958
Will I get to ordain?

712
00:42:09,166 --> 00:42:11,083
-Guys, it hurts.
-Are you all right?

713
00:42:11,166 --> 00:42:13,083
Oh, no. It's all over you.

714
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:35,458
Farewell, Jak.

715
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:50,833
It will be okay.

716
00:42:51,916 --> 00:42:53,333
Jak has gone to a better place.

717
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:02,791
Thank you so much for your help, Nong.

718
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:06,208
Please accept my condolences.

719
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:07,791
Try not to think too much.

720
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:23,041
-What's wrong, Nong?
-Nong.

721
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:24,083
-What?
-What's wrong?

722
00:43:24,166 --> 00:43:25,791
-Calm down. What's wrong?
-Nong.

723
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:27,666
-What's wrong?
-What did you see?

724
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:28,916
-What's wrong?
-Say something.

725
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,125
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

726
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:31,833
-I'm fine.
-What?

727
00:43:32,458 --> 00:43:33,291
-Is he fine?
-Jui.

728
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:34,708
-Nong.
-I'll see you later.

729
00:43:36,291 --> 00:43:37,416
What's going on, Nong?

730
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:52,541
Nong.

731
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:55,333
What happened?

732
00:43:55,875 --> 00:43:57,041
You looked troubled back there.

733
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:00,083
Nong.

734
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,416
Nong.

735
00:44:02,083 --> 00:44:03,458
Are you all right?

736
00:44:07,791 --> 00:44:09,375
I think the ghost
that has been haunting us

737
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:11,458
isn't Jak's ghost.

738
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:14,625
<i>Did you see its face?</i>

739
00:44:17,916 --> 00:44:19,208
Its arm

740
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:21,666
was full of tattoos.

741
00:44:24,083 --> 00:44:25,375
And do you remember

742
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:27,708
that Jak's body

743
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:29,791
<i>had no tattoos at all?</i>

744
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:34,458
It could be a different ghost.

745
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:35,666
Jeez.

746
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:37,166
What the hell?

747
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:40,083
I almost went crazy because of one ghost.

748
00:44:40,166 --> 00:44:41,708
And now there's a second one.

749
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:52,166
...unguents or adornments.

750
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:55,375
-...unguents or adornments.
-...unguents or adornments.

751
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:59,875
I will not sleep in comfortable beds...

752
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:05,166
-I will not sleep in comfortable beds...
-I will not sleep in comfortable beds...

753
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:07,583
...with padding or cotton.

754
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:10,541
-...with padding or cotton.
-...with padding or cotton.

755
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,583
I will not touch

756
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:16,000
or accept money...

757
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:18,708
-I will not touch
-I will not touch

758
00:45:18,791 --> 00:45:21,666
-or accept money...
-or accept money...

759
00:45:21,958 --> 00:45:23,875
...that will profit us.

760
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:26,666
-...that will profit us.
-...that will profit us.

761
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:28,916
Can you cite it
without looking at the book?

762
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,208
I will

763
00:45:30,625 --> 00:45:31,666
not

764
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:32,750
dance--

765
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:34,458
-It's "listen."
-Oh, my...

766
00:45:34,541 --> 00:45:35,583
You scared me.

767
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,583
...listen to music

768
00:45:37,666 --> 00:45:38,708
or watch any drama--

769
00:45:38,791 --> 00:45:40,166
"Any dance"!

770
00:45:40,916 --> 00:45:42,083
You keep wanting to watch dramas.

771
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:43,416
This is a religious chant,

772
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,791
not "Sabai Sabai" by Thongchai McIntyre

773
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:47,416
that I listened to since I was young.

774
00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:48,708
Who could memorize all of these?

775
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:51,666
Exactly, and there are ten rules.

776
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:52,708
We can barely chant

777
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:55,083
the most basic prayer.

778
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:56,958
Aod, give us some time.

779
00:45:57,041 --> 00:45:57,916
He's right.

780
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,708
How long do you need?

781
00:46:00,416 --> 00:46:01,791
You're already behind schedule.

782
00:46:02,916 --> 00:46:03,916
Let's do it again.

783
00:46:04,541 --> 00:46:07,000
-I will not touch
-I will not touch

784
00:46:07,083 --> 00:46:10,083
<i>-or accept money
-or accept money</i>

785
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:13,125
<i>-that will profit us.
-that will profit us.</i>

786
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:15,333
I will not

787
00:46:15,791 --> 00:46:16,916
listen

788
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:19,291
to music

789
00:46:19,541 --> 00:46:23,083
or watch any dance.

790
00:46:23,708 --> 00:46:25,791
I will not

791
00:46:26,166 --> 00:46:27,416
decorate myself

792
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:29,333
with garlands,

793
00:46:30,291 --> 00:46:31,458
perfumes,

794
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:34,083
unguents,

795
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:37,666
or adornments.

796
00:46:38,416 --> 00:46:40,041
I will not sleep

797
00:46:40,375 --> 00:46:41,916
in comfortable beds

798
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:45,958
with padding or cotton.

799
00:46:46,875 --> 00:46:48,833
I will not touch...

800
00:46:49,666 --> 00:46:50,916
What's next?

801
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:53,833
"Or accept money."

802
00:46:54,416 --> 00:46:55,375
Oh, right.

803
00:46:55,791 --> 00:46:58,791
That will profit us...

804
00:47:58,666 --> 00:47:59,583
Balloon.

805
00:48:02,833 --> 00:48:03,708
First.

806
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:10,458
Hey.

807
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:12,166
Balloon.

808
00:48:12,916 --> 00:48:13,833
First.

809
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:17,208
First.

810
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:39,083
Hey.

811
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:40,416
You can come out now.

812
00:48:42,708 --> 00:48:43,541
Balloon.

813
00:48:46,083 --> 00:48:46,958
First.

814
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:49,708
I'll seriously kick you guys.

815
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:51,958
Stop joking around.

816
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:01,416
Hey.

817
00:49:02,708 --> 00:49:03,625
First.

818
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:36,250
Oh, my god. Aod!

819
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,166
Since when were you here?

820
00:49:45,166 --> 00:49:46,541
Are you sure that you want

821
00:49:47,458 --> 00:49:48,625
to get ordained?

822
00:49:52,083 --> 00:49:53,833
It's not too late to change your mind.

823
00:49:55,083 --> 00:49:56,458
What do you mean?

824
00:49:56,916 --> 00:49:58,666
What's with you?

825
00:50:05,041 --> 00:50:06,166
Your pendant looks nice.

826
00:50:14,208 --> 00:50:15,708
Doesn't it make you uncomfortable?

827
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,416
I warned you.

828
00:50:40,416 --> 00:50:41,333
No.

829
00:50:45,958 --> 00:50:47,541
Hey.

830
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,833
Let me go.

831
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:52,875
Let me go.

832
00:50:52,958 --> 00:50:54,375
Hey.

833
00:50:56,541 --> 00:50:57,625
I will kill everyone

834
00:50:57,916 --> 00:50:59,000
who gets ordained.

835
00:51:12,791 --> 00:51:13,666
What...

836
00:51:15,708 --> 00:51:16,666
No.

837
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:30,041
No.

838
00:51:30,458 --> 00:51:31,333
No.

839
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:35,083
No.

840
00:51:38,166 --> 00:51:39,291
No!

841
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:47,666
What's wrong?

842
00:51:49,708 --> 00:51:50,583
Novice,

843
00:51:51,458 --> 00:51:52,916
a ghost haunted me last night.

844
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:55,958
He said he would kill all of us

845
00:51:56,541 --> 00:51:57,708
if we got ordained.

846
00:51:58,083 --> 00:52:00,708
Why does the ghost
want to take revenge on naks?

847
00:52:01,208 --> 00:52:03,208
Can we not become a nak, Novice?

848
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:04,875
Can we just skip it and become monks?

849
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:06,666
No.

850
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,333
Becoming a nak

851
00:52:12,916 --> 00:52:14,333
is a very important process

852
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:16,958
because there's a story behind it.

853
00:52:24,125 --> 00:52:26,125
<i>Once, there was the Phaya Nak</i>

854
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,083
<i>who transformed himself into a human</i>

855
00:52:28,416 --> 00:52:30,958
<i>because he believed in Buddhism.</i>

856
00:52:32,083 --> 00:52:34,583
<i>He came to get ordained.</i>

857
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:47,458
<i>However, later,</i>

858
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:51,125
<i>the truth was revealed</i>

859
00:52:51,708 --> 00:52:53,083
<i>that he wasn't human</i>

860
00:52:55,666 --> 00:52:58,541
<i>but a nak who disguised himself.</i>

861
00:53:17,583 --> 00:53:20,125
<i>Naks like him didn't deserve
to be born as a human.</i>

862
00:53:22,416 --> 00:53:24,000
<i>He couldn't get ordained</i>

863
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:26,458
<i>because he would never be enlightened</i>

864
00:53:27,375 --> 00:53:29,125
<i>if everyone found out he was a nak.</i>

865
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:33,625
<i>The nak was very disappointed when
he heard that he couldn't get ordained.</i>

866
00:53:41,458 --> 00:53:44,041
<i>However, he left his name</i>

867
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,416
<i>with other humans
who were getting ordained,</i>

868
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:49,500
<i>to receive merit</i>

869
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:51,958
<i>that he couldn't do it himself.</i>

870
00:53:56,083 --> 00:53:57,208
<i>As for him,</i>

871
00:53:57,625 --> 00:53:59,166
<i>he vowed to serve Buddhism</i>

872
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:03,083
<i>in other ways.</i>

873
00:54:10,833 --> 00:54:12,416
And that is why

874
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,208
newly ordained people

875
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:17,416
are called "naga" or "nak" since then.

876
00:54:18,958 --> 00:54:20,083
Keep in mind

877
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:23,958
that you deserved merit
enough to be born as human

878
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:26,958
with an opportunity to get ordained.

879
00:54:42,708 --> 00:54:45,083
The nak didn't kill Jak, did he?

880
00:54:46,625 --> 00:54:47,541
Well...

881
00:55:00,416 --> 00:55:01,375
How are you feeling?

882
00:55:02,541 --> 00:55:03,500
Are you okay?

883
00:55:08,541 --> 00:55:10,583
At first, I wasn't okay.

884
00:55:12,916 --> 00:55:14,666
But I'm starting to accept the truth.

885
00:55:17,291 --> 00:55:18,291
Eventually,

886
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:21,208
people part ways.

887
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:28,291
It's just a matter of time.

888
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:02,583
Jui.

889
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:04,375
Well, Jui.

890
00:56:05,458 --> 00:56:07,250
It's done.

891
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,333
You can collect his ashes.

892
00:56:10,041 --> 00:56:11,291
-Okay.
-Okay.

893
00:56:13,416 --> 00:56:15,291
Please excuse me then.

894
00:56:15,958 --> 00:56:17,583
I'll talk to you next time.

895
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:19,291
Okay.

896
00:57:00,666 --> 00:57:01,916
Where's the noise coming from?

897
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:07,291
My god.

898
00:57:11,166 --> 00:57:12,166
Who's that?

899
00:57:15,333 --> 00:57:16,375
Is that you, Nong?

900
00:57:18,416 --> 00:57:19,291
Yes.

901
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:20,916
Oh, gosh.

902
00:57:21,208 --> 00:57:22,208
Nong.

903
00:57:22,291 --> 00:57:23,833
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming here?

904
00:57:23,916 --> 00:57:26,000
You scared me, Nong.

905
00:57:33,833 --> 00:57:34,875
Nong.

906
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,500
Nong.

907
00:58:00,083 --> 00:58:02,500
Are you farting lightly
or breathing really heavily?

908
00:58:05,666 --> 00:58:07,208
Are you all right, Nong?

909
00:58:07,291 --> 00:58:08,541
Are you all right, Nong?

910
00:58:10,625 --> 00:58:13,750
Oh, my god. Nong, the lights went off.

911
00:58:14,416 --> 00:58:16,125
Where's my flashlight?

912
00:58:16,708 --> 00:58:18,833
Nong, are you still there?

913
00:58:19,833 --> 00:58:22,083
Why is this happening to me?
I need to shit.

914
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:24,958
Nong, you didn't wait for me.
Please, wait for me.

915
00:58:25,041 --> 00:58:27,458
Nong!

916
00:58:33,541 --> 00:58:34,416
Nong.

917
00:58:35,791 --> 00:58:36,666
Nong.

918
00:58:37,958 --> 00:58:39,125
Nong.

919
00:58:42,541 --> 00:58:44,250
Are you in here, Nong?

920
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:53,333
Nong.

921
00:58:56,416 --> 00:58:57,666
Nong, is that you?

922
00:58:59,083 --> 00:59:00,125
To be honest,

923
00:59:00,583 --> 00:59:02,500
I like seeing you take a shower.

924
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,666
But isn't it a bit odd

925
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,708
to take shower

926
00:59:10,041 --> 00:59:11,791
at this late hour?

927
00:59:13,708 --> 00:59:14,791
Nong.

928
00:59:21,416 --> 00:59:22,541
Nong.

929
00:59:23,041 --> 00:59:25,041
I'm scared, Nong.

930
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:28,416
Oh, my god.

931
00:59:28,958 --> 00:59:32,125
Nong.

932
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:37,166
Nong.

933
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,541
Please hurry up and finish your shower.

934
00:59:40,708 --> 00:59:42,791
I'm scared, Nong.

935
00:59:45,166 --> 00:59:46,583
I'm scared. Gosh!

936
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:48,833
Nong.

937
00:59:49,791 --> 00:59:51,708
Why is your neck like that, Nong?

938
01:00:06,916 --> 01:00:08,625
-Damn it, First. What's wrong?
-I'm scared.

939
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:10,541
First, it's me.

940
01:00:10,958 --> 01:00:12,750
-No. Don't.
-It's me.

941
01:00:12,958 --> 01:00:14,041
What's wrong?

942
01:00:15,583 --> 01:00:16,541
Hey.

943
01:00:20,291 --> 01:00:21,541
Don't possess me.

944
01:00:22,541 --> 01:00:23,958
What? I'm human.

945
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:25,416
I don't believe you.

946
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,500
-Homage to the blessed...
-First, it's me.

947
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:31,208
I'm human, Mr. Chartchai.

948
01:00:36,625 --> 01:00:38,375
Here. Touch me if you don't believe me.

949
01:00:52,458 --> 01:00:53,333
Okay.

950
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:54,833
I'm still not certain though.

951
01:00:55,666 --> 01:00:56,625
What the hell?

952
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:10,833
Hey.

953
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:11,916
That's enough.

954
01:01:16,833 --> 01:01:18,000
Are you human?

955
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:19,583
Of course.

956
01:01:20,166 --> 01:01:21,708
If you're really human,

957
01:01:23,291 --> 01:01:25,791
then you must remember
the promise you gave me.

958
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:30,583
What promise?

959
01:01:32,916 --> 01:01:34,041
That I could touch your snake.

960
01:01:34,125 --> 01:01:35,333
Oh, my god. Fuck you.

961
01:01:35,416 --> 01:01:36,458
First.

962
01:01:36,541 --> 01:01:37,750
Fuck you.

963
01:01:38,583 --> 01:01:39,416
Damn you.

964
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:43,083
Stop. I'm sorry. It hurts. Oh, my god.

965
01:01:43,416 --> 01:01:44,708
What the hell was that?

966
01:01:48,416 --> 01:01:50,583
It's really you.

967
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:52,416
Of course, it is.

968
01:02:09,416 --> 01:02:11,166
I will kill everyone who gets in my way.

969
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:15,666
Hey.

970
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:17,458
Hang on, First.

971
01:02:17,958 --> 01:02:19,000
What?

972
01:02:19,666 --> 01:02:21,666
I hear a bell ringing.

973
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:25,541
Who would ring a bell at this hour?

974
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,541
-Balloon.
-Balloon.

975
01:02:35,291 --> 01:02:36,791
Let's go there now.

976
01:02:38,958 --> 01:02:40,208
Oh, my god.

977
01:02:41,666 --> 01:02:43,083
-Balloon.
-Balloon.

978
01:02:43,958 --> 01:02:45,500
-What are you doing?
-Help me, First.

979
01:02:45,583 --> 01:02:47,125
Why are you banging your head on the bell?

980
01:02:47,208 --> 01:02:50,458
What sort of crazy person rings their head
on a bell? I can't control it, dumbass.

981
01:02:50,541 --> 01:02:52,875
-What? This isn't right, bitch.
-Help me.

982
01:02:52,958 --> 01:02:53,791
Damn it.

983
01:02:53,875 --> 01:02:54,833
-Nong.
-Hey.

984
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,166
What the hell, First?

985
01:02:56,416 --> 01:02:58,083
-It's a ghost.
-Why aren't we helping him?

986
01:02:58,166 --> 01:03:00,208
-Help me, you fucktards.
-You can't, Nong.

987
01:03:00,291 --> 01:03:02,416
-He will die.
-We will die.

988
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:03,833
-Nong, don't.
-Hey.

989
01:03:03,916 --> 01:03:06,083
-Nong, don't.
-Move aside right now.

990
01:03:06,291 --> 01:03:07,541
-No.
-Move.

991
01:03:08,041 --> 01:03:09,250
First, Nong, help me.

992
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:11,083
-First, help me.
-Balloon.

993
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:12,916
Balloon.

994
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,916
-Balloon.
-Help him.

995
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,916
Guys...

996
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,125
-Hang on, Balloon.
-Balloon, what's going on?

997
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:25,166
Shit.

998
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:26,166
Balloon.

999
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:27,916
First, hold this.

1000
01:03:28,333 --> 01:03:29,583
Stand on my shoulders.

1001
01:03:30,041 --> 01:03:31,208
Stand on my shoulders.

1002
01:03:32,083 --> 01:03:33,833
Balloon, are you okay?

1003
01:03:34,291 --> 01:03:35,458
Put it down.

1004
01:03:35,541 --> 01:03:36,625
I'm doing it.

1005
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:37,916
Climb up.

1006
01:03:39,833 --> 01:03:40,833
Cut it.

1007
01:03:42,833 --> 01:03:43,666
My God.

1008
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:44,708
Balloon.

1009
01:03:45,625 --> 01:03:47,583
Balloon.

1010
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:49,541
-How's he, Nong?
-Oh, no.

1011
01:03:51,958 --> 01:03:53,083
He's not breathing.

1012
01:03:53,666 --> 01:03:54,916
Balloon.

1013
01:03:55,416 --> 01:03:56,625
Balloon.

1014
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,541
Balloon.

1015
01:04:00,958 --> 01:04:02,166
I must perform CPR on him.

1016
01:04:09,708 --> 01:04:10,750
Wait.

1017
01:04:11,208 --> 01:04:12,208
Nong.

1018
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:15,333
You can't.

1019
01:04:16,666 --> 01:04:18,750
Leave it to me.

1020
01:04:26,083 --> 01:04:27,083
Balloon.

1021
01:04:27,958 --> 01:04:29,458
I'll save you.

1022
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,541
Don't.

1023
01:04:41,625 --> 01:04:42,583
First.

1024
01:04:43,208 --> 01:04:44,166
Balloon.

1025
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:45,208
Balloon.

1026
01:04:45,375 --> 01:04:47,083
Why did you hit me, bitch?

1027
01:04:47,458 --> 01:04:50,208
You can't kiss me, bitch. I'm your friend.

1028
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:52,250
Guys.

1029
01:04:52,333 --> 01:04:53,208
What?

1030
01:04:53,291 --> 01:04:55,208
I heard the ghost say

1031
01:04:55,708 --> 01:04:57,458
he will kill everyone

1032
01:04:57,791 --> 01:04:59,208
who gets in his way.

1033
01:05:01,375 --> 01:05:02,750
Who will get in his way besides us

1034
01:05:05,041 --> 01:05:06,541
who want to get ordained?

1035
01:05:07,291 --> 01:05:10,041
<i>Thus indeed</i>

1036
01:05:10,125 --> 01:05:12,375
<i>Is that blessed one</i>

1037
01:05:12,625 --> 01:05:14,041
<i>-He is the holy one
-He is the holy one</i>

1038
01:05:14,125 --> 01:05:16,833
<i>-Fully enlightened
-Fully enlightened</i>

1039
01:05:21,958 --> 01:05:23,000
<i>Endowed with clear vision</i>

1040
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:25,166
<i>-And virtuous conduct
-And virtuous conduct</i>

1041
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:27,208
<i>-Sublime
-Sublime</i>

1042
01:05:47,125 --> 01:05:50,708
<i>-The knower of the worlds
-Knower of the worlds</i>

1043
01:05:50,791 --> 01:05:52,333
<i>The incomparable leader of men</i>

1044
01:05:52,416 --> 01:05:54,416
<i>To be tamed</i>

1045
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:59,083
<i>The teacher of gods and men</i>

1046
01:05:59,166 --> 01:06:03,208
<i>Enlightened and blessed</i>

1047
01:06:06,166 --> 01:06:07,416
If I don't get to be ordained,

1048
01:06:08,833 --> 01:06:10,166
then no one will.

1049
01:06:18,958 --> 01:06:19,916
Luang Por.

1050
01:06:30,791 --> 01:06:33,041
Normally, Luang Por
wakes up before everyone.

1051
01:06:35,041 --> 01:06:36,500
Why didn't he wake up today?

1052
01:06:37,875 --> 01:06:38,791
I wonder the same.

1053
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:44,541
Is Luang Por sick?

1054
01:06:47,083 --> 01:06:47,958
Aod.

1055
01:06:49,958 --> 01:06:50,875
Oh, my...

1056
01:06:53,041 --> 01:06:54,000
What's going on?

1057
01:06:59,333 --> 01:07:00,250
Luang Por!

1058
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:03,041
-What is it, Aod?
-Aod, open the door.

1059
01:07:03,541 --> 01:07:04,500
Aod, open the door.

1060
01:07:07,041 --> 01:07:08,000
Luang Por.

1061
01:07:08,208 --> 01:07:09,666
-Luang Por.
-Luang Por.

1062
01:07:09,958 --> 01:07:11,583
Aod, how is he?

1063
01:07:11,958 --> 01:07:13,000
Luang Por.

1064
01:07:14,166 --> 01:07:15,166
Luang Por.

1065
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:19,791
-Luang Por.
-Luang Por.

1066
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,666
-Luang Por.
-Luang Por.

1067
01:07:21,958 --> 01:07:23,125
Luang Por.

1068
01:07:23,208 --> 01:07:24,208
Luang Por.

1069
01:07:24,375 --> 01:07:25,791
Luang Por.

1070
01:07:26,166 --> 01:07:27,458
Luang Por.

1071
01:07:32,041 --> 01:07:32,916
Novice,

1072
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:36,208
the undertaker wants me to tell you

1073
01:07:37,541 --> 01:07:38,875
that Luang Por's relatives

1074
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:42,125
will come to bring his body home.

1075
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,833
Aod.

1076
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:49,958
Luang Por isn't with us anymore.

1077
01:07:50,916 --> 01:07:52,666
How will we carry on?

1078
01:07:57,833 --> 01:07:59,666
Our temple has no monk.

1079
01:08:09,958 --> 01:08:11,083
Stay strong, Aod.

1080
01:08:13,666 --> 01:08:14,791
You'll have monks.

1081
01:08:15,333 --> 01:08:16,666
You have the three of us.

1082
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:27,833
Thank you so much.

1083
01:08:31,041 --> 01:08:32,375
But I'm fine now.

1084
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:36,583
Tomorrow,

1085
01:08:36,958 --> 01:08:38,708
I'll prepare for your ordainment.

1086
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,000
Please excuse me.

1087
01:08:50,791 --> 01:08:52,500
I'll help Grandpa out.

1088
01:08:52,833 --> 01:08:53,916
That's okay, Aod.

1089
01:08:55,041 --> 01:08:56,166
I'll go.

1090
01:08:57,041 --> 01:08:58,250
I want to check on Novice too.

1091
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:31,583
Oh, no.

1092
01:09:33,708 --> 01:09:34,916
What's wrong?

1093
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:39,250
First.

1094
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,208
Taohoo broke up with me.

1095
01:09:46,875 --> 01:09:48,541
He said he knocked up a girl.

1096
01:09:58,916 --> 01:10:00,041
It's okay.

1097
01:10:00,666 --> 01:10:02,958
If only I didn't make the damn vow,

1098
01:10:04,291 --> 01:10:06,208
all of this shit wouldn't have happened.

1099
01:10:08,208 --> 01:10:09,833
I would still be with him.

1100
01:10:11,166 --> 01:10:12,791
Luang Por would still be alive.

1101
01:10:13,791 --> 01:10:16,041
All of this didn't happen
because of your vow.

1102
01:10:18,916 --> 01:10:19,791
Balloon.

1103
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,166
What will you do?

1104
01:10:24,708 --> 01:10:26,375
-Balloon.
-Wait.

1105
01:10:26,458 --> 01:10:27,708
What will you do, Balloon?

1106
01:10:30,291 --> 01:10:31,708
Everything started at the shrine.

1107
01:10:32,458 --> 01:10:33,833
Therefore, it must end at the shrine.

1108
01:10:34,333 --> 01:10:35,458
Move aside!

1109
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:03,083
Why did Jui come?

1110
01:11:13,833 --> 01:11:14,875
Balloon.

1111
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:15,958
Balloon.

1112
01:11:17,583 --> 01:11:18,500
Balloon.

1113
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,333
Balloon, don't.

1114
01:11:20,416 --> 01:11:22,291
Balloon, don't.

1115
01:11:22,375 --> 01:11:24,375
-What do you want?
-Don't do it.

1116
01:11:24,625 --> 01:11:26,375
What will you get
out of destroying the shrine?

1117
01:11:26,458 --> 01:11:27,500
You could die.

1118
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:29,500
I've had enough with this fucking ghost.

1119
01:11:29,583 --> 01:11:30,708
Move aside!

1120
01:11:31,666 --> 01:11:32,625
Fuck you.

1121
01:11:33,541 --> 01:11:35,083
Fuck you. I can't take it anymore.

1122
01:11:39,083 --> 01:11:40,041
I made a vow,

1123
01:11:40,166 --> 01:11:41,500
and you wanted me to fulfill it.

1124
01:11:41,958 --> 01:11:43,791
Now that I'm here,
you wouldn't let me get ordained.

1125
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
What do you want with me?

1126
01:11:45,083 --> 01:11:46,500
Calm down.

1127
01:11:46,583 --> 01:11:47,583
Stay out of it.

1128
01:11:49,916 --> 01:11:51,666
I have had enough with you, dumb ghost.

1129
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:52,625
PEE NAK SHRINE

1130
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:54,583
You decided to piss me off?

1131
01:11:54,958 --> 01:11:55,833
All right then.

1132
01:11:55,916 --> 01:11:57,291
You wanted to piss me off, right?

1133
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:59,791
-Here you go.
-Hey.

1134
01:12:00,041 --> 01:12:01,583
Hey.

1135
01:12:12,125 --> 01:12:13,583
Jui.

1136
01:12:15,166 --> 01:12:16,041
Jui.

1137
01:12:16,166 --> 01:12:17,666
Why didn't you say goodbye?

1138
01:12:18,041 --> 01:12:19,000
Nong.

1139
01:12:21,333 --> 01:12:24,541
Actually, I was going to leave
after Jak's ordainment.

1140
01:12:25,083 --> 01:12:26,333
But then he passed away,

1141
01:12:26,416 --> 01:12:28,208
so I asked my office
if I could stay here longer.

1142
01:12:31,208 --> 01:12:32,666
But you are the reason

1143
01:12:33,416 --> 01:12:35,500
that I'm staying here to get ordained.

1144
01:12:36,833 --> 01:12:37,916
Nong.

1145
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:41,208
Why exactly did you come here
to get ordained?

1146
01:12:46,041 --> 01:12:47,500
You were just like me.

1147
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:50,833
We were heartbroken.
Something bad happened to us,

1148
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:53,166
so we needed someone to rely on.

1149
01:12:54,833 --> 01:12:57,458
You may think
that you have feelings for me.

1150
01:12:57,833 --> 01:13:00,208
But actually, you don't really love me.

1151
01:13:01,041 --> 01:13:02,583
You're just afraid of being alone.

1152
01:13:04,541 --> 01:13:05,791
<i>I felt the same way.</i>

1153
01:13:06,333 --> 01:13:07,791
<i>I didn't want to be alone.</i>

1154
01:13:09,458 --> 01:13:10,916
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1155
01:13:11,916 --> 01:13:14,916
<i>The only thing you should be thinking
about right now is your ordainment.</i>

1156
01:13:16,041 --> 01:13:17,375
<i>Do it for yourself</i>

1157
01:13:17,833 --> 01:13:19,041
<i>and your father.</i>

1158
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:22,291
Nong.

1159
01:13:22,541 --> 01:13:23,583
Something bad has happened.

1160
01:13:24,041 --> 01:13:25,000
What is it, Novice?

1161
01:13:26,791 --> 01:13:28,041
Aod called and said

1162
01:13:28,458 --> 01:13:30,041
that Balloon went to destroy the shrine.

1163
01:13:30,125 --> 01:13:31,041
What?

1164
01:13:32,583 --> 01:13:33,833
That's enough.

1165
01:13:33,916 --> 01:13:35,000
-Balloon, enough.
-Stop.

1166
01:13:35,083 --> 01:13:37,041
There comes the alms bowl.

1167
01:13:37,166 --> 01:13:38,250
That's enough.

1168
01:13:38,833 --> 01:13:40,416
-Nong, let's go.
-Balloon.

1169
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,333
-Nong, hurry.
-Balloon.

1170
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:44,875
What the hell are you doing? Get out.

1171
01:13:46,083 --> 01:13:48,250
Balloon, what the hell are you doing?

1172
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,750
-There.
-Oh, my god.

1173
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,333
What are you doing? You will kill us all.

1174
01:13:53,416 --> 01:13:54,625
Look at what he did.

1175
01:14:19,458 --> 01:14:21,000
Show yourself.

1176
01:14:21,083 --> 01:14:22,083
Balloon.

1177
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:24,083
Don't just make a sound.

1178
01:14:41,041 --> 01:14:42,458
Hello.

1179
01:14:42,541 --> 01:14:43,500
I'm selling ice-cream.

1180
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:45,708
Here. I have black bean
and coconut milk flavors.

1181
01:14:45,791 --> 01:14:47,208
Do you want one?

1182
01:14:48,375 --> 01:14:49,291
Damn it, you old man!

1183
01:14:49,375 --> 01:14:50,833
-Hey.
-Balloon.

1184
01:14:51,708 --> 01:14:53,041
-Calm down.
-Hey.

1185
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:54,958
Damn it.

1186
01:14:56,041 --> 01:14:56,958
Look.

1187
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:05,666
Nak.

1188
01:15:09,416 --> 01:15:10,666
Where did Nak go?

1189
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:12,750
Nak, where did you go?

1190
01:15:15,291 --> 01:15:17,541
Where did Nak go?

1191
01:15:21,958 --> 01:15:23,250
-Go away.
-What do you want?

1192
01:15:23,333 --> 01:15:25,541
-What do you want?
-Go away.

1193
01:15:25,625 --> 01:15:26,666
Get out.

1194
01:15:37,083 --> 01:15:39,333
My child.

1195
01:15:39,416 --> 01:15:41,583
-Let's help her out.
-My child.

1196
01:15:42,125 --> 01:15:44,166
-My child!
-Oh, my...

1197
01:15:44,833 --> 01:15:46,208
My child!

1198
01:15:48,416 --> 01:15:49,458
My child.

1199
01:15:49,541 --> 01:15:51,291
My child.

1200
01:15:51,375 --> 01:15:52,583
Nak.

1201
01:15:52,666 --> 01:15:53,958
Nak.

1202
01:15:54,625 --> 01:15:55,625
Miss,

1203
01:15:56,125 --> 01:15:57,750
I'm sorry.

1204
01:15:59,666 --> 01:16:01,541
I got carried away.

1205
01:16:03,375 --> 01:16:04,333
Go away.

1206
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:05,666
-Go away.
-It's okay.

1207
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:07,208
-It's okay.
-Go away.

1208
01:16:07,291 --> 01:16:09,458
-It will be okay.
-My friend didn't mean it.

1209
01:16:09,541 --> 01:16:10,583
-Go away.
-Please calm down.

1210
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:11,791
-I'm sorry.
-Go away.

1211
01:16:11,875 --> 01:16:13,250
I said, go away!

1212
01:16:13,333 --> 01:16:15,166
-Oh, my god.
-Go away.

1213
01:16:16,958 --> 01:16:18,333
-Miss.
-Wait, miss.

1214
01:16:22,208 --> 01:16:23,416
What should we do, Novice?

1215
01:16:23,833 --> 01:16:25,416
What the hell have you done, Balloon?

1216
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:28,833
Why didn't you think before you did it?

1217
01:16:39,833 --> 01:16:40,833
Guys.

1218
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:42,708
This photo.

1219
01:16:42,791 --> 01:16:43,666
What?

1220
01:16:44,291 --> 01:16:45,333
Look, Nong.

1221
01:16:46,333 --> 01:16:47,583
We must find out

1222
01:16:47,833 --> 01:16:49,333
who this nak is

1223
01:16:50,541 --> 01:16:51,875
and how he's related to this woman.

1224
01:16:52,416 --> 01:16:54,375
Who can we ask about this?

1225
01:16:54,583 --> 01:16:55,708
Guys.

1226
01:16:57,916 --> 01:16:58,875
You could ask my grandpa.

1227
01:17:03,416 --> 01:17:04,291
Grandpa,

1228
01:17:04,375 --> 01:17:05,375
I know

1229
01:17:05,916 --> 01:17:07,875
that you know who this guy is

1230
01:17:07,958 --> 01:17:09,375
and how he's related to Pee Nak's ghost.

1231
01:17:10,458 --> 01:17:12,458
It's been a long time already.

1232
01:17:14,166 --> 01:17:15,291
I, myself,

1233
01:17:15,375 --> 01:17:18,458
tried to forget about Non, the Nak.

1234
01:17:21,291 --> 01:17:24,208
I think it was seven years ago.

1235
01:17:25,833 --> 01:17:27,583
<i>There was a woman</i>

1236
01:17:28,666 --> 01:17:30,166
<i>named Phorn.</i>

1237
01:17:31,416 --> 01:17:33,791
She brought her son, Non, to this temple

1238
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,750
<i>to get ordained.</i>

1239
01:17:38,416 --> 01:17:39,875
<i>Non, the Nak,</i>

1240
01:17:40,666 --> 01:17:42,541
<i>used to be a gangster. </i>

1241
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:46,291
He went to prison many times.

1242
01:17:47,708 --> 01:17:50,875
And he was also arrested for murder.

1243
01:17:54,416 --> 01:17:57,000
But then one day,
he wanted to get ordained

1244
01:17:57,291 --> 01:17:59,083
for his mother.

1245
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:03,083
<i>However, on the day of his ordainment,</i>

1246
01:18:03,916 --> 01:18:06,541
<i>he passed away.</i>

1247
01:18:06,625 --> 01:18:07,750
THUMMANAKANIMIT TEMPLE

1248
01:18:33,583 --> 01:18:35,958
-What?
-Nak? Where?

1249
01:18:36,041 --> 01:18:38,166
Move aside.

1250
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:40,750
Move aside. Make way.

1251
01:18:40,833 --> 01:18:42,375
-No.
-Hurry.

1252
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:43,416
Nak!

1253
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:44,500
Nak Non!

1254
01:18:44,958 --> 01:18:47,333
Nak Non.

1255
01:18:52,083 --> 01:18:53,833
Non.

1256
01:18:53,916 --> 01:18:56,458
Non, here's the lotus. Hold the lotus.

1257
01:18:56,541 --> 01:18:59,041
Let's head in the chapel.
It's almost time.

1258
01:19:00,791 --> 01:19:03,500
Phorn was devastated.

1259
01:19:04,666 --> 01:19:06,541
<i>She became crazy.</i>

1260
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,166
<i>She told everyone</i>

1261
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:10,833
<i>to not touch</i>

1262
01:19:10,916 --> 01:19:13,750
<i>-her son's body.
</i>-Don't touch him. He's not dead.

1263
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:15,375
You can't take him away.

1264
01:19:15,458 --> 01:19:17,250
<i>As we are speaking, his body</i>

1265
01:19:17,541 --> 01:19:19,666
<i>is being kept in the old chapel
behind the temple.</i>

1266
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:20,833
<i>Stay away from my child.</i>

1267
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:24,125
So that's what happened.

1268
01:19:26,625 --> 01:19:28,166
Damn it, Balloon.

1269
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:30,000
Balloon, enough.

1270
01:19:31,208 --> 01:19:33,333
Why did I have to be that hot-headed?

1271
01:19:35,583 --> 01:19:37,208
Why does Nak Non's pendant

1272
01:19:37,541 --> 01:19:39,458
look exactly like Nong's pendant?

1273
01:19:47,166 --> 01:19:48,500
Nong, look at this picture.

1274
01:19:49,208 --> 01:19:50,416
That's Luang Loong.

1275
01:19:50,666 --> 01:19:52,791
He's Luang Loong
that we met in the hospital, right?

1276
01:19:53,833 --> 01:19:55,291
Why are you giving it to me?

1277
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:56,958
Keep it with you.

1278
01:19:57,041 --> 01:19:59,666
You will know when the time comes.

1279
01:19:59,833 --> 01:20:01,916
-Nak, my child.
-Nong.

1280
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,583
Can I see the pendant you're wearing?

1281
01:20:07,416 --> 01:20:10,041
This is the same Nak Prok pendant

1282
01:20:10,583 --> 01:20:12,708
that Non, the Nak,

1283
01:20:12,916 --> 01:20:16,041
gave to this monk before he passed away.

1284
01:20:16,458 --> 01:20:17,958
It's this pendant.

1285
01:20:23,666 --> 01:20:24,708
Phorn.

1286
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:35,458
Go away.

1287
01:20:38,958 --> 01:20:41,208
Miss, I'm sorry.

1288
01:20:41,916 --> 01:20:44,791
They are here to apologize, Phorn.

1289
01:20:51,833 --> 01:20:53,083
Phorn, it's okay.

1290
01:20:54,791 --> 01:20:57,041
-Miss, I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

1291
01:20:57,708 --> 01:21:00,083
Miss, I didn't mean to do it.

1292
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:08,541
It's okay.

1293
01:21:08,916 --> 01:21:10,583
I'll fix the shrine for you.

1294
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:18,125
PEE NAK SHRINE

1295
01:21:24,833 --> 01:21:26,208
It's fixed.

1296
01:21:31,666 --> 01:21:34,125
Tomorrow,
the three of us will be ordained.

1297
01:21:35,875 --> 01:21:37,833
I would like to dedicate
my ordainment to Phorn

1298
01:21:38,583 --> 01:21:40,041
on your behalf.

1299
01:21:42,333 --> 01:21:44,208
He will be ordained for you.

1300
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:48,083
We would like you

1301
01:21:49,375 --> 01:21:50,708
to forgive us

1302
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:53,291
for everything we've done in the past.

1303
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:02,666
-Mister.
-Yes.

1304
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:04,916
I would like to return

1305
01:22:06,541 --> 01:22:08,083
this Nak Prok pendant to Nak Non.

1306
01:22:08,208 --> 01:22:09,458
I see. Okay.

1307
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:10,916
I'll hold it for you.

1308
01:22:19,291 --> 01:22:20,833
Do you feel better now?

1309
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:21,916
That's good.

1310
01:22:22,375 --> 01:22:24,125
You should get some rest.

1311
01:22:24,208 --> 01:22:25,666
Your ordainment is tomorrow, isn't it?

1312
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:30,125
As for Phorn,

1313
01:22:30,291 --> 01:22:31,750
I'll take care of her.

1314
01:22:32,708 --> 01:22:35,125
-I respectfully request the sangha
-I respectfully request the sangha

1315
01:22:35,208 --> 01:22:37,750
-for the third time to ordain me
-for the third time to ordain me

1316
01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:39,416
-as a monk.
-as a monk.

1317
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,958
-I beg the sangha out of compassion
-I beg the sangha out of compassion

1318
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:44,875
-to lift me up from the status
-to lift me up from the status

1319
01:22:44,958 --> 01:22:46,583
-of a nak.
-of a nak.

1320
01:22:51,666 --> 01:22:52,916
We finally got it right.

1321
01:23:06,458 --> 01:23:08,083
It will finally be over soon.

1322
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:10,958
I can't wait for tomorrow.

1323
01:23:13,833 --> 01:23:14,708
Listen.

1324
01:23:14,791 --> 01:23:16,416
If we get ordained,

1325
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:18,958
the curse that has been going on here

1326
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:20,958
will end.

1327
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:27,125
Oh, right.

1328
01:23:29,875 --> 01:23:31,041
Balloon.

1329
01:23:31,791 --> 01:23:32,833
Nong.

1330
01:23:34,041 --> 01:23:35,166
I have something to tell you.

1331
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:40,541
My dad will come tomorrow.

1332
01:23:41,375 --> 01:23:43,416
Did your dad finally accept who you are?

1333
01:23:45,583 --> 01:23:46,791
I guess so.

1334
01:23:48,541 --> 01:23:50,000
This ordainment

1335
01:23:51,083 --> 01:23:52,333
is the only thing

1336
01:23:53,583 --> 01:23:55,583
that makes my dad proud of me.

1337
01:23:59,458 --> 01:24:00,458
What about you?

1338
01:24:00,916 --> 01:24:03,125
You people have daddy issues.

1339
01:24:05,333 --> 01:24:06,333
I don't know.

1340
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:08,458
I didn't invite him.

1341
01:24:09,666 --> 01:24:12,166
But he knows that I came to get ordained.

1342
01:24:13,416 --> 01:24:14,875
If he wants to come, he'll show up.

1343
01:24:17,916 --> 01:24:19,375
Where's the bell ringing coming from?

1344
01:24:30,416 --> 01:24:32,208
Oh, I know.

1345
01:24:32,833 --> 01:24:34,458
It must be that ice-cream man.

1346
01:24:35,041 --> 01:24:37,375
Let me scold him once
before I get ordained.

1347
01:24:39,333 --> 01:24:42,416
Let me enjoy this moment scolding him.

1348
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:48,166
Wait.

1349
01:24:49,416 --> 01:24:51,583
Isn't it too late for anyone
to be selling ice-cream?

1350
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,666
What's he looking at?

1351
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:13,500
Look at him.

1352
01:25:21,666 --> 01:25:22,708
Balloon.

1353
01:25:23,958 --> 01:25:25,083
What's wrong?

1354
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:28,916
Are you okay?

1355
01:25:30,666 --> 01:25:32,000
Did you fall asleep?

1356
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:34,333
Oh, my god.

1357
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:40,750
What the hell is going on? Oh, my god.

1358
01:25:41,833 --> 01:25:43,541
Fuck. What now?

1359
01:25:44,958 --> 01:25:45,916
It's the Nak Prok pendant.

1360
01:25:46,458 --> 01:25:48,041
Take it back. It's yours.

1361
01:25:51,416 --> 01:25:53,875
Do you think I would let you go so easily?

1362
01:25:54,083 --> 01:25:55,083
Nak Non.

1363
01:25:55,333 --> 01:25:56,708
What is it that you want?

1364
01:25:56,958 --> 01:25:57,958
Please tell us.

1365
01:25:58,333 --> 01:25:59,666
You can't give it to me.

1366
01:26:00,333 --> 01:26:01,458
I don't care.

1367
01:26:02,291 --> 01:26:03,583
You must die.

1368
01:26:03,875 --> 01:26:05,083
I told you.

1369
01:26:05,166 --> 01:26:06,208
-Nong.
-Shit.

1370
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:08,208
Nong. Oh, no.

1371
01:26:08,291 --> 01:26:10,166
-The ghost is here.
-Shit.

1372
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:12,458
I'm sorry. Gosh!

1373
01:26:12,541 --> 01:26:14,541
Nong, what's going on?

1374
01:26:14,625 --> 01:26:15,708
It won't open.

1375
01:26:15,791 --> 01:26:17,250
I will kill you all.

1376
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:22,416
Hello.

1377
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:24,500
Hello, my ass. This isn't the time.

1378
01:26:24,708 --> 01:26:26,458
-Oh, my god.
-Help us, Novice.

1379
01:26:26,583 --> 01:26:27,583
Come here.

1380
01:26:27,666 --> 01:26:29,333
-Help.
-What is it?

1381
01:26:29,458 --> 01:26:31,208
What happened?

1382
01:26:32,041 --> 01:26:33,708
Novice, do you know
how to perform an exorcism?

1383
01:26:33,791 --> 01:26:35,958
No, I don't.

1384
01:26:36,041 --> 01:26:37,083
We're screwed.

1385
01:26:37,666 --> 01:26:40,083
You must do it. Balloon's possessed.

1386
01:26:40,166 --> 01:26:42,750
You're our only hope. Go and face him.

1387
01:26:42,833 --> 01:26:43,791
-Help us.
-Oh, my god.

1388
01:26:43,875 --> 01:26:46,125
I'm a novice, not one of the X-Men.

1389
01:26:46,208 --> 01:26:48,333
Is this time to fucking joke around?

1390
01:26:49,291 --> 01:26:50,833
I'm sorry.

1391
01:26:51,458 --> 01:26:53,375
-Novice, go in there.
-You're our only hope.

1392
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:55,416
That's enough.

1393
01:26:55,541 --> 01:26:56,791
Stop.

1394
01:26:57,833 --> 01:26:58,958
Fine.

1395
01:27:17,333 --> 01:27:18,791
I'm sorry.

1396
01:27:20,166 --> 01:27:21,666
Shit.

1397
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:31,583
How dare you throw up in my face?

1398
01:27:32,041 --> 01:27:34,083
I'll beat you up when you wake up.

1399
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:44,708
If what Nak Non wants is to get ordained,

1400
01:27:47,416 --> 01:27:48,916
why don't we do it for him?

1401
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,083
Right, First?

1402
01:27:54,041 --> 01:27:57,166
It's already weird enough that a gay man
like me wants to get ordained.

1403
01:27:58,291 --> 01:27:59,791
Will you ordain a ghost too now?

1404
01:28:02,666 --> 01:28:03,541
Yes.

1405
01:28:07,333 --> 01:28:08,208
Novice.

1406
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,958
As we are speaking, his body

1407
01:28:12,166 --> 01:28:14,250
is being kept in the old chapel
behind the temple.

1408
01:28:23,375 --> 01:28:24,291
Oh, my god.

1409
01:28:24,375 --> 01:28:25,333
Nong.

1410
01:28:37,166 --> 01:28:38,166
Shit.

1411
01:28:43,708 --> 01:28:44,791
-Aod.
-Yes.

1412
01:28:44,875 --> 01:28:46,708
Bring the ordaining equipment
from the shrine.

1413
01:28:47,333 --> 01:28:49,166
You and I will bring Balloon here.
Let's go.

1414
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:50,125
Let's go, Nong.

1415
01:28:50,208 --> 01:28:51,916
Wait, everyone.

1416
01:28:52,916 --> 01:28:54,208
I'm sorry.

1417
01:28:56,916 --> 01:28:58,125
But what about me?

1418
01:28:59,458 --> 01:29:00,791
You can watch the body.

1419
01:29:01,375 --> 01:29:02,250
What?

1420
01:29:04,458 --> 01:29:05,416
Balloon.

1421
01:29:08,333 --> 01:29:09,791
-Balloon.
-Do we pick him up?

1422
01:29:09,875 --> 01:29:11,958
-What the fuck did you tie me with?
-Let's do it.

1423
01:29:12,041 --> 01:29:12,958
Gosh.

1424
01:29:13,041 --> 01:29:14,000
Pick him up.

1425
01:29:14,583 --> 01:29:17,166
Hold still, Nak Non.
I'm trying to help you.

1426
01:29:17,333 --> 01:29:19,458
Nak Non, my butt. It's me, Balloon.

1427
01:29:19,541 --> 01:29:20,791
What? Is that you, Balloon?

1428
01:29:21,583 --> 01:29:23,166
-Balloon.
-Let me go.

1429
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,791
When did Nak Non's spirit leave your body?

1430
01:29:26,958 --> 01:29:27,916
What?

1431
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,208
Was I possessed?

1432
01:29:29,291 --> 01:29:30,208
-Yes.
-Yes.

1433
01:29:30,291 --> 01:29:32,208
-Can you just untie me now?
-Okay.

1434
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:33,416
Hurry up.

1435
01:29:35,625 --> 01:29:36,916
-God.
-Ouch.

1436
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,958
-Get me up.
-Who the hell was that?

1437
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:42,208
-Get me up.
-Aod, watch where you're going.

1438
01:29:43,958 --> 01:29:46,458
-I'm very fragile.
-Untie me. What the hell is this?

1439
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:49,291
Shit. Guys.

1440
01:29:49,541 --> 01:29:50,958
Did you get scared again?

1441
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,166
The body is gone.

1442
01:29:56,416 --> 01:29:57,791
The body is gone.

1443
01:29:58,041 --> 01:29:59,083
What body?

1444
01:29:59,583 --> 01:30:01,541
What? Where did Novice go?

1445
01:30:02,291 --> 01:30:03,291
You're right.

1446
01:30:03,541 --> 01:30:04,541
Novice.

1447
01:30:04,625 --> 01:30:05,875
-Novice.
-Where did he go?

1448
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:08,208
-Novice.
-I'm here!

1449
01:30:10,791 --> 01:30:14,083
Novice, I told you to watch the body.
What are you doing over there?

1450
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:16,916
Well, the body isn't over there,

1451
01:30:17,666 --> 01:30:19,291
but it's here.

1452
01:30:19,375 --> 01:30:20,416
What the hell?

1453
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:21,625
Shit.

1454
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:23,083
-Novice.
-What?

1455
01:30:23,166 --> 01:30:25,083
-What's going on, Novice?
-Novice.

1456
01:30:28,166 --> 01:30:29,208
-Novice.
-Novice.

1457
01:30:31,291 --> 01:30:32,333
Guys.

1458
01:30:32,666 --> 01:30:33,916
Help me.

1459
01:30:34,833 --> 01:30:36,250
I can't breathe.

1460
01:30:37,958 --> 01:30:39,208
Where are you dragging me to?

1461
01:30:39,291 --> 01:30:41,541
Oh, shit.

1462
01:30:41,708 --> 01:30:42,750
Guys.

1463
01:30:43,166 --> 01:30:44,291
-Guys.
-Oh, no.

1464
01:30:44,916 --> 01:30:47,000
-Guys.
-What should we do?

1465
01:30:47,333 --> 01:30:48,583
Hurry and help him.

1466
01:30:48,666 --> 01:30:49,666
-Aod.
-Nong.

1467
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:50,833
Guys.

1468
01:30:50,916 --> 01:30:52,875
Nong, help him.

1469
01:30:52,958 --> 01:30:54,500
Say something.

1470
01:30:54,958 --> 01:30:57,000
Tell him to let Novice go, Nong.

1471
01:30:57,083 --> 01:30:58,666
-Guys.
-What do you want me to say?

1472
01:30:58,750 --> 01:31:01,166
Nong, say what the fuck you want.
Just say something. Hurry.

1473
01:31:01,416 --> 01:31:02,375
Let me think.

1474
01:31:02,625 --> 01:31:04,708
-Hurry.
-Hurry. Novice is dying, Nong.

1475
01:31:04,791 --> 01:31:06,041
He is dying.

1476
01:31:06,375 --> 01:31:07,666
I know. Just let me think.

1477
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:09,458
Can you think any faster?

1478
01:31:10,083 --> 01:31:12,541
-Hurry, Nong.
-Novice, are you okay?

1479
01:31:12,875 --> 01:31:14,125
Ordainment...

1480
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:15,583
Nak Non.

1481
01:31:17,708 --> 01:31:18,875
Let him go

1482
01:31:19,041 --> 01:31:20,208
if you want to get ordained.

1483
01:31:34,875 --> 01:31:36,500
If you don't keep your word,

1484
01:31:38,208 --> 01:31:39,458
you die.

1485
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:40,875
Nong.

1486
01:31:41,875 --> 01:31:43,666
Are you negotiating with him

1487
01:31:44,208 --> 01:31:46,125
or challenging him?

1488
01:31:49,541 --> 01:31:51,291
-Novice.
-Novice.

1489
01:31:58,458 --> 01:31:59,416
Novice.

1490
01:32:00,625 --> 01:32:02,500
Please get it done for us. Do it.

1491
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:03,916
-Wait.
-Novice.

1492
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,333
What do you want me to do?

1493
01:32:05,666 --> 01:32:06,583
What?

1494
01:32:06,750 --> 01:32:07,958
Ordain him.

1495
01:32:08,041 --> 01:32:10,833
Guys, I'm a novice, not a monk.

1496
01:32:10,916 --> 01:32:12,458
I can't ordain anybody.

1497
01:32:13,166 --> 01:32:14,458
Nong.

1498
01:32:14,583 --> 01:32:16,958
What were you thinking?
A novice ordaining someone as a monk?

1499
01:32:17,041 --> 01:32:18,958
We are fucked. I already gave him my word.

1500
01:32:20,083 --> 01:32:21,708
You go, then.

1501
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:23,958
No.

1502
01:32:25,208 --> 01:32:26,166
His legs...

1503
01:32:28,833 --> 01:32:31,375
Do something. First, think of something.

1504
01:32:31,458 --> 01:32:32,583
First, think of something.

1505
01:32:32,666 --> 01:32:34,083
Do something, First.

1506
01:32:34,583 --> 01:32:35,666
I figured out a way!

1507
01:32:38,333 --> 01:32:40,208
<i>You guys came to the right person.</i>

1508
01:32:40,666 --> 01:32:41,666
<i>Don't worry.</i>

1509
01:32:42,583 --> 01:32:44,208
<i>I'll take care of him.</i>

1510
01:32:44,791 --> 01:32:46,458
Are you sure this will work?

1511
01:32:48,833 --> 01:32:51,291
We will have to roll with it.

1512
01:33:01,458 --> 01:33:02,750
<i>Is this the ghost</i>

1513
01:33:04,041 --> 01:33:05,791
<i>that scared me the other day?</i>

1514
01:33:09,541 --> 01:33:10,583
<i>Novice.</i>

1515
01:33:11,458 --> 01:33:12,625
<i>Back up, Novice.</i>

1516
01:33:13,291 --> 01:33:15,083
<i>He's coming closer. Back up.</i>

1517
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:17,666
<i>Stay right there.</i>

1518
01:33:20,541 --> 01:33:22,416
Can you ordain me?

1519
01:33:24,625 --> 01:33:25,791
<i>His tone...</i>

1520
01:33:26,541 --> 01:33:28,166
<i>Is this a favor or a threat?</i>

1521
01:33:29,083 --> 01:33:29,958
<i>All right.</i>

1522
01:33:30,125 --> 01:33:31,458
<i>Where's the equipment? </i>

1523
01:33:31,833 --> 01:33:32,791
Here.

1524
01:33:32,875 --> 01:33:35,375
These are Nak Non's alms bowl
and talipot fan.

1525
01:33:36,583 --> 01:33:37,708
<i>Where's the robe?</i>

1526
01:33:38,208 --> 01:33:39,458
Here's the robe.

1527
01:33:41,416 --> 01:33:42,791
-Oh, no.
-What?

1528
01:33:43,541 --> 01:33:44,541
Where's the robe?

1529
01:33:44,625 --> 01:33:46,875
-Aod!
-Aod, where did it go?

1530
01:33:47,458 --> 01:33:49,083
-Where did it go?
-I don't know.

1531
01:33:49,166 --> 01:33:50,916
<i>If you don't have the robe, then I'm out.</i>

1532
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,958
Come on. Don't leave, Luang Na.

1533
01:33:54,333 --> 01:33:55,583
Luang Na.

1534
01:33:56,208 --> 01:33:57,166
Aod!

1535
01:33:57,250 --> 01:33:59,375
Where did you put it? Find it right now.

1536
01:33:59,458 --> 01:34:02,333
The robe.

1537
01:34:02,541 --> 01:34:03,916
The robe is here.

1538
01:34:05,041 --> 01:34:06,791
The robe is here.

1539
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,291
Here's the robe.

1540
01:34:46,291 --> 01:34:47,291
Here.

1541
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:50,416
Here's your robe.

1542
01:35:00,416 --> 01:35:02,500
I will finally get ordained for you.

1543
01:35:05,041 --> 01:35:05,958
All right.

1544
01:35:20,291 --> 01:35:21,333
<i>Do you know</i>

1545
01:35:21,791 --> 01:35:23,208
<i>how to cite the chant?</i>

1546
01:35:25,375 --> 01:35:26,291
Yes.

1547
01:35:26,375 --> 01:35:27,333
<i>In that case,</i>

1548
01:35:27,541 --> 01:35:30,375
<i>please cite a few lines for me.</i>

1549
01:35:32,250 --> 01:35:33,208
Okay.

1550
01:35:33,666 --> 01:35:34,958
<i>Do you have bronchiectasis?</i>

1551
01:35:36,833 --> 01:35:38,375
No, I don't.

1552
01:35:39,166 --> 01:35:40,708
<i>Do you have epilepsy?</i>

1553
01:35:41,958 --> 01:35:43,583
No, I don't.

1554
01:35:44,375 --> 01:35:45,833
<i>Are you a human being?</i>

1555
01:35:49,875 --> 01:35:51,750
<i>Are you a human being?</i>

1556
01:35:57,250 --> 01:35:58,708
I'm not human.

1557
01:36:01,458 --> 01:36:02,916
But I would like to be ordained

1558
01:36:05,416 --> 01:36:07,166
if you would be kind enough...

1559
01:36:09,416 --> 01:36:10,833
If you would be kind...

1560
01:36:15,666 --> 01:36:17,250
<i>I cannot ordain you.</i>

1561
01:36:17,333 --> 01:36:18,708
What?

1562
01:36:18,791 --> 01:36:20,375
<i>Because you are not human.</i>

1563
01:36:21,791 --> 01:36:23,333
<i>Those who can be ordained</i>

1564
01:36:23,958 --> 01:36:25,041
<i>must be human.</i>

1565
01:36:32,625 --> 01:36:34,166
If I don't get to be ordained,

1566
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,166
then nobody will.

1567
01:36:43,708 --> 01:36:44,625
Oh, no.

1568
01:36:46,708 --> 01:36:48,083
Nak.

1569
01:36:48,208 --> 01:36:51,208
Nak, please calm down. Luang Na!

1570
01:36:51,291 --> 01:36:52,208
Luang Na.

1571
01:36:52,291 --> 01:36:53,791
Luang Na.

1572
01:36:53,875 --> 01:36:56,041
-Is he possessed?
-Oh, my god. Luang Na!

1573
01:36:56,125 --> 01:36:57,958
Well, no...

1574
01:36:58,083 --> 01:36:59,541
He's not possessed.

1575
01:36:59,958 --> 01:37:00,958
I...

1576
01:37:01,125 --> 01:37:02,583
I'm sorry.

1577
01:37:02,708 --> 01:37:04,416
-I...
-What is it, Novice?

1578
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:06,583
I ran out of data.

1579
01:37:06,666 --> 01:37:07,875
-What?
-Gosh?

1580
01:37:07,958 --> 01:37:10,791
-Why didn't you buy extra data?
-What's your problem?

1581
01:37:12,041 --> 01:37:13,708
What's your problem?

1582
01:37:13,791 --> 01:37:15,125
-First.
-What?

1583
01:37:16,625 --> 01:37:18,708
Shit!

1584
01:37:19,833 --> 01:37:21,333
Non.

1585
01:37:21,416 --> 01:37:22,958
Non.

1586
01:37:23,666 --> 01:37:25,041
Non, please don't.

1587
01:37:25,583 --> 01:37:26,625
Non.

1588
01:37:28,750 --> 01:37:30,208
If I don't get to be ordained,

1589
01:37:32,541 --> 01:37:33,791
they must die.

1590
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:36,958
That's enough, Non.

1591
01:37:37,541 --> 01:37:39,541
Please don't hurt people anymore.

1592
01:37:41,958 --> 01:37:43,208
Non.

1593
01:37:47,458 --> 01:37:48,583
Nak Non.

1594
01:37:48,791 --> 01:37:50,666
You believe in the Phaya Nak, right?

1595
01:37:52,291 --> 01:37:54,333
Then please be like the nak.

1596
01:37:55,583 --> 01:37:58,125
Please accept the fact
that you cannot get ordained.

1597
01:38:08,208 --> 01:38:09,875
Enough already, Non.

1598
01:38:10,750 --> 01:38:12,000
I let it go.

1599
01:38:15,791 --> 01:38:17,666
Your yellow robe

1600
01:38:18,791 --> 01:38:20,333
isn't as important

1601
01:38:20,916 --> 01:38:23,375
as you leaving in peace.

1602
01:38:25,875 --> 01:38:28,291
Do you hear me, son?

1603
01:38:30,958 --> 01:38:32,208
Non.

1604
01:39:02,166 --> 01:39:03,541
Nong, come here.

1605
01:39:03,625 --> 01:39:04,666
Did the ghost listen?

1606
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:25,958
My poor Non.

1607
01:39:36,083 --> 01:39:37,708
My child.

1608
01:39:39,791 --> 01:39:42,208
If I get to be reincarnated as a human,

1609
01:39:44,916 --> 01:39:47,083
can I be born as your child again?

1610
01:39:58,666 --> 01:40:00,541
Of course, you can.

1611
01:40:18,291 --> 01:40:19,541
My child.

1612
01:40:43,541 --> 01:40:45,500
Could I have Non's robe?

1613
01:40:45,666 --> 01:40:47,500
I will get ordained on his behalf.

1614
01:40:57,583 --> 01:40:58,458
<i>First,</i>

1615
01:40:59,166 --> 01:41:00,625
<i>this ordainment</i>

1616
01:41:00,875 --> 01:41:03,416
<i>will make a military man like your father</i>

1617
01:41:03,625 --> 01:41:06,458
<i>proud of a beautiful gay son like you.</i>

1618
01:41:07,541 --> 01:41:11,291
This yellow piece of cloth
will send your dad to heaven

1619
01:41:11,416 --> 01:41:13,166
faster than taking a jet plane.

1620
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:29,375
<i>Can you stop fooling yourself?</i>

1621
01:41:29,458 --> 01:41:31,583
<i>You're gay. You don't have a uterus.</i>

1622
01:41:31,708 --> 01:41:32,875
<i>Shouldn't you save this money</i>

1623
01:41:33,083 --> 01:41:35,000
<i>for your future?</i>

1624
01:41:36,666 --> 01:41:39,166
<i>To be honest, I came here to get ordained</i>

1625
01:41:40,791 --> 01:41:42,083
<i>for my mother.</i>

1626
01:41:44,458 --> 01:41:46,250
<i>I want to do something for her</i>

1627
01:41:48,708 --> 01:41:50,208
<i>even though she isn't with me anymore.</i>

1628
01:42:31,916 --> 01:42:33,541
<i>Do you have dermatophytosis?</i>

1629
01:42:33,625 --> 01:42:35,000
<i>-No, I don't.
-No, I don't.</i>

1630
01:42:35,125 --> 01:42:36,375
<i>Do you have bronchiectasis?</i>

1631
01:42:36,458 --> 01:42:37,708
<i>-No, I don't.
-No, I don't.</i>

1632
01:42:37,791 --> 01:42:39,458
<i>Do you have epilepsy?</i>

1633
01:42:39,541 --> 01:42:40,875
<i>-No, I don't.
-No, I don't.</i>

1634
01:42:40,958 --> 01:42:43,000
<i>Are you a human being?</i>

1635
01:42:44,541 --> 01:42:46,333
<i>-Yes, I am.
-Yes, I am.</i>

1636
01:42:48,250 --> 01:42:50,250
Let's make some merit.

1637
01:42:50,333 --> 01:42:53,333
Shall we make some merit?
We're already here. We must.

1638
01:42:55,250 --> 01:42:57,333
Wow. Look at those yellow robes.

1639
01:42:57,416 --> 01:42:59,208
All three of them got ordained together.

1640
01:43:03,416 --> 01:43:04,625
Give it to him.

1641
01:43:05,250 --> 01:43:06,291
Nak.

1642
01:43:07,666 --> 01:43:10,458
-My dear.
-All right. Everything turned out okay.

1643
01:43:10,666 --> 01:43:11,791
My dear.

1644
01:43:27,416 --> 01:43:29,458
The curse of Nak Non is finally over.

1645
01:43:29,583 --> 01:43:30,791
By the way, Luang Pee,

1646
01:43:31,750 --> 01:43:32,708
<i>Luang Loong said</i>

1647
01:43:32,791 --> 01:43:34,958
<i>Luang Por wasn't harmed by Nak Non.</i>

1648
01:43:35,708 --> 01:43:37,291
<i>He died of natural causes.</i>

1649
01:43:40,958 --> 01:43:42,083
Oh, right. Aod.

1650
01:43:42,416 --> 01:43:43,291
Yes.

1651
01:43:43,375 --> 01:43:44,708
I want you to keep this.

1652
01:43:46,458 --> 01:43:47,916
Keep it as a reminder that one day,

1653
01:43:48,791 --> 01:43:50,333
you will get ordained for your grandpa.

1654
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Thank you.

1655
01:43:56,625 --> 01:43:59,250
Stay as a monk for three <i>phansa</i> like us.

1656
01:43:59,333 --> 01:44:00,375
What?

1657
01:44:01,916 --> 01:44:02,791
You...

1658
01:44:03,083 --> 01:44:05,541
What did you just say? Three <i>phansa</i>?

1659
01:44:06,458 --> 01:44:09,666
Three <i>phansa</i> means three months.

1660
01:44:11,833 --> 01:44:13,916
Three <i>phansa</i> isn't three months! I...

1661
01:44:24,458 --> 01:44:27,000
One <i>phansa</i> is three months.

1662
01:44:27,208 --> 01:44:29,291
But three <i>phansa</i> means three years!

1663
01:44:35,458 --> 01:44:36,333
Look.

1664
01:44:36,708 --> 01:44:39,666
I thought we were here to fulfill the vow,
not to get enlightened.

1665
01:44:43,833 --> 01:44:45,000
Please calm down.

1666
01:44:45,083 --> 01:44:46,625
Stop the car.

1667
01:44:47,708 --> 01:44:49,000
-Aod.
-Yes.

1668
01:44:49,083 --> 01:44:50,208
Where's your grandpa?

1669
01:44:50,333 --> 01:44:51,916
He's at the crematory. What's going on?

1670
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,291
This is Luang Ta Gorn's body.

1671
01:44:53,416 --> 01:44:54,666
He used to stay at this temple.

1672
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:55,875
He passed away.

1673
01:44:56,541 --> 01:44:58,416
By the way, did you know

1674
01:44:58,500 --> 01:45:00,791
he passed away one day
before leaving the monkhood?

1675
01:45:01,583 --> 01:45:03,958
I'll send him to your grandpa then.

1676
01:45:04,291 --> 01:45:05,333
Let's go.

1677
01:45:11,333 --> 01:45:12,833
Could it be the curse?

1678
01:45:13,708 --> 01:45:15,166
What curse now?

1679
01:45:17,458 --> 01:45:18,416
In this temple,

1680
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:21,416
besides the curse of the nak
who can never become a monk,

1681
01:45:21,916 --> 01:45:24,458
there's also another curse that
monks can never leave the monkhood.

1682
01:45:25,208 --> 01:45:26,541
Those who want to leave the monkhood

1683
01:45:26,666 --> 01:45:28,125
all end up dead.

1684
01:45:29,833 --> 01:45:30,958
Jeez!

1685
01:45:33,541 --> 01:45:35,583
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

1686
01:45:35,916 --> 01:45:37,458
Come on, Luang Pee.

1687
01:45:37,750 --> 01:45:38,791
You saw it.

1688
01:45:38,875 --> 01:45:40,500
I was busy running away
from ghosts with you.

1689
01:45:40,583 --> 01:45:42,125
Who would have thought about this?

1690
01:45:44,041 --> 01:45:45,041
Novice.

1691
01:45:45,958 --> 01:45:48,208
Can no one help us at all?

1692
01:45:49,208 --> 01:45:50,166
Luang Pee.

1693
01:45:50,708 --> 01:45:52,833
The whole Marvel team

1694
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,791
wouldn't even be able to help you.

1695
01:45:55,458 --> 01:45:56,375
Well,

1696
01:45:56,583 --> 01:45:58,000
you will be here for three <i>phansa</i>.

1697
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,041
You have a lot of time to solve this case.

1698
01:46:02,666 --> 01:46:04,208
Stay here with me for a long time.

1699
01:46:13,208 --> 01:46:14,208
Here we go again.

1700
01:46:28,458 --> 01:46:29,333
-Oh, no.
-Aod.

1701
01:46:29,416 --> 01:46:30,291
Aod.

1702
01:46:30,375 --> 01:46:31,416
Aod.

1703
01:46:55,916 --> 01:46:57,083
What are you smiling at?

1704
01:46:59,333 --> 01:47:00,250
After you.

1705
01:47:08,541 --> 01:47:09,750
You're not so pretty.

1706
01:47:18,166 --> 01:47:20,125
Don't look at me, honey. Just let me go.

1707
01:47:25,833 --> 01:47:27,291
So that's what happened.

1708
01:47:27,375 --> 01:47:28,250
What?

1709
01:47:30,375 --> 01:47:32,166
He just wants to hit you.

1710
01:47:36,083 --> 01:47:37,250
Have you said cut yet?

1711
01:47:39,333 --> 01:47:40,916
-It's making noise.
-Guys.

1712
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,666
Hurry up.

1713
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:43,666
Hurry up.

1714
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:46,916
Oh, no.

1715
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:47,875
Shit.

1716
01:47:48,958 --> 01:47:52,125
Didn't you research
how scary this place was?

1717
01:47:55,875 --> 01:47:56,791
You bitch.

1718
01:47:59,208 --> 01:48:00,083
Go!

1719
01:48:01,291 --> 01:48:02,208
Oh, no. He fell.

1720
01:48:02,541 --> 01:48:04,375
He's safe. It's okay.

1721
01:48:06,791 --> 01:48:08,833
Take a look at him.

1722
01:48:10,333 --> 01:48:11,750
-I can't. It's too hot.
-Bring a fan.

1723
01:48:11,833 --> 01:48:13,166
-Okay.
-That's enough.

1724
01:48:13,250 --> 01:48:14,708
-Don't gather around.
-Come.

1725
01:48:14,791 --> 01:48:15,750
Jui.

1726
01:48:15,958 --> 01:48:17,083
-Why didn't--
-Help.

1727
01:48:18,833 --> 01:48:19,708
I know...

1728
01:48:24,458 --> 01:48:25,333
Oh, my god.

1729
01:48:25,791 --> 01:48:28,041
-Help!
-Won't you say cut?

1730
01:48:28,125 --> 01:48:30,666
If I don't get to be ordained,
then no one will.

1731
01:48:30,750 --> 01:48:31,791
Cut. Luang Por.

1732
01:48:31,875 --> 01:48:34,000
Luang Por, you are not dead yet.
Wait until I finish talking.

1733
01:48:34,083 --> 01:48:34,958
I see.

1734
01:48:36,875 --> 01:48:38,333
Wait until I finish talking.

1735
01:48:51,291 --> 01:48:53,291
