被解救的姜戈

1858年 内战爆发两年前

吁
Whoa.

12
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,971
乌漆麻黑的谁在那鬼鬼祟祟?
Who's that stumblin' around in the dark?

13
00:04:22,138 --> 00:04:25,934
说明你的来意 不然就准备挂彩吧!
State your business or prepare to get winged!

14
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,686
别冲动 先生们
Calm yourselves, gentlemen.

15
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:31,189
我并无恶意
I mean you no harm.

16
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:36,194
我只是个疲倦的旅人 停下 孩子
I'm simply a fellow weary traveler. Whoa, boy.

17
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:39,197
寒冷的晚上好 先生们
Good cold evening, gentlemen.

18
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:41,699
我在寻找一对奴隶商人
I'm looking for a pair of slave traders

19
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:43,534
他们自称是斯派克兄弟
that go by the name of the Speck Brothers.

20
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:45,536
请问是否是阁下?
Might that be you?

21
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:49,666
- 谁想知道?  - 嗯 我想
- Who wants to know?  - Well, I do.

22
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,709
我是金·舒尔茨医生 这是我的坐骑 小德
I'm Dr. King Schultz. This is my horse, Fritz.

23
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:56,464
- 什么医生?  - 牙医
- What kinda doctor?  - Dentist.

24
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:58,424
请问你们是斯派克兄弟吗?
Now, are you the Speck Brothers?

25
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:01,386
你们是在格林维尔奴隶卖场买下他们的吗?
And did you purchase those men at the Greenville slave auction?

26
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:04,138
- 是又怎样?  - 那我就有要事相商
- So what?  - So I wish to parley with you.

27
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:07,642
- 说人话  - 喔 对不起
- Speak English.  - Oh, I'm sorry.

28
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:10,019
请原谅 那并非我的母语
Please forgive me. It is a second language.

29
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:13,481
目前 你手里这些存货 我深信里面
Now, amongst your inventory, I've been led to believe,

30
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:16,067
一定有我需要的货色
is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.

31
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:17,694
好啊 你们这些可怜的小鬼们!
Hello, you poor devils!

32
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:21,614
你们之中谁曾经是
Is there one amongst you who was formerly a resident

33
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:25,076
卡鲁肯农场的人?
of the Carrucan plantation?

34
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:28,037
我是卡鲁肯农场来的
I'm from the Carrucan plantation.

35
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:31,040
说话的人在哪?
Who said that?

36
00:06:18,254 --> 00:06:19,630
你叫什么名字?
What's your name?

37
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:25,678
姜戈
Django.

38
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:28,598
那我找的就是你了
Then you are exactly the one I'm looking for.

39
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:32,685
你知道布里托兄弟是谁吗?
Do you know who the Brittle Brothers are?

40
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:37,315
谁?
Who are they?

41
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:41,360
大约翰
Big John.

42
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:43,488
埃利斯
Ellis.

43
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:48,826
罗杰 有时候也叫做小罗
Roger. Sometime they call him Lil Raj.

44
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:52,413
他们都曾是卡鲁肯农场的监工
They was overseers at the Carrucan plantation.

45
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,664
他们走了
Not anymore.

46
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:57,794
告诉我...
Tell me...

47
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:01,172
如果你再遇到那三位
if you were to see any of these three gentlemen again,

48
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:04,008
- 你能认出他们吗?  - 嘿
- would you recognize them?  - Hey.

49
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:06,636
- 别这么跟他说话  - 怎么说?
- Stop talkin' to him like that.  - Like What?

50
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:08,346
就你这么说
Like that.

51
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:10,807
我的好兄弟 我只是想核定...
My good man, I'm simply trying to ascertain...

52
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,017
说人话 该死的
Speak English, goddamn it.

53
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:14,936
都冷静点
Everybody calm down.

54
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:18,815
我只是个顾客 来做一笔买卖
I'm simply a customer trying to conduct a transaction.

55
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,984
我不在乎 不卖 你走吧
I don't care. No sale. Now, off with ya.

56
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:25,154
别开玩笑了 他们当然是待售的
Don't be ridiculous. Of course they're for sale.

57
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,448
好狗不挡路
Move it.

58
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:32,537
我的好兄弟 你这是摆个舞枪弄棒的姿势呢
My good man, did you simply get carried away with your dramatic gesture

59
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:36,499
还是要动真枪威胁我?
or are you pointing your weapon at me with lethal intention?

60
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,460
再给你一次机会 娘炮
Last chance, fancy pants.

61
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,214
哦 好吧
Oh, very well.

62
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:14,412
抱歉 射杀了你的牲口
I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast,

63
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:16,497
我是怕你还没三思
but I didn't want you to do anything rash

64
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:18,958
就冲动行事
before you had a moment to come to your senses.

65
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,545
你个狗娘养的!
You goddamn son of a bitch!

66
00:08:22,712 --> 00:08:25,506
- 你杀了罗斯科!  - 好吧...
- You shot Roscoe!  - Well...

67
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:27,383
- 你还杀了小杰!  - 别急着下定论
- And you killed Ace! -No. No. No.

68
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,219
我杀你哥也是出于自卫
I only shot your brother once he threatened to shoot me.

69
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:33,222
而且我有... 一 二 三 四...
And I do believe I have... one, two, three, four...

70
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:36,350
五名目击证人可以佐证
five witnesses who can attest to that fact.

71
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,395
- 腿疼爆了!  - 必然的
- Damn leg's busted!  - No doubt.

72
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:42,106
好了 请你尽量不要鬼哭狼嚎
Now, if you could keep your caterwauling down to a minimum,

73
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:45,610
我想最后再问小姜戈几个问题
I'd like to finish my line of inquiry with young Django.

74
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:53,075
- 天杀的我靠!  - 接着我刚说的...
- God-fuckin'-damn it!  - As I was saying...

75
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:56,954
要是你再看见布里托兄弟你能认出他们吗?
if you were to see the Brittle Brothers again, you could recognize 'em?

76
00:08:57,622 --> 00:08:59,332
能
Yeah.

77
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:00,791
成交!
Sold American!

78
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,921
那 斯派克先生? 斯派克? 小姜戈要多少钱?
So, Mr. Speck? Mr. Speck? How much for young Django here?

79
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:12,845
那个大铁块是最恼人的了
That iron is nasty business.

80
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:20,186
对了 你能帮我拿一下吗?
Oh, could you hold this for a moment?

81
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:23,814
谢谢你 姜戈?
Thank you. Django?

82
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:25,858
上马
Get up on that horse.

83
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:27,818
还有 要是我是你
Also, if I were you,

84
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:31,989
我就拿上那个死斯派克身上的大衣
I'd take that winter coat the dear departed Speck left behind.

85
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:50,007
黑鬼! 你敢动我哥的大衣
Nigger! Don't you touch my brother's coat.

86
00:10:00,685 --> 00:10:05,606
他妈的! 疼!
Goddamn it! Oh!

87
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:12,446
一百... 一十... 二十...
One hundred... ten... 20...

88
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,448
五块...
and five...

89
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,867
这是小姜戈的
for young Django here.

90
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:19,203
既然你留着也没什么用
And since he won't be needing it anymore,

91
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,872
我想连你哥的老马一并买下
I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.

92
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:27,545
还有 斯派克先生 我恐怕还需要一张卖身契
Also, Mr. Speck, I'm afraid I will require a bill of sale.

93
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:29,297
你有吗?
Do you have one?

94
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:32,383
去死吧 牙医
You go to hell, dentist.

95
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,552
我猜就没有
I thought not.

96
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:38,222
别担心 我是有备而来
No worries. I come prepared.

97
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,145
谢谢
Thank you.

98
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:47,898
就用这个当契约吧
This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.

99
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:01,245
吁
Whoa.

100
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:08,878
至于你们这些可怜的小鬼
Now, as to you poor devils.

101
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:14,091
如此 就我看来 该考虑下一步做什么了
So, as I see it, when it comes to the subject of what to do next,

102
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:17,094
现在是各位做出选择的时候了
you gentlemen have two choices.

103
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:22,391
一条路是 我走之后 你们把活的那个斯派克从那牲口身下拽出来
One: Once I'm gone, you could lift that beast off the remaining Speck,

104
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:24,477
然后把他抬到最近的小镇
then carry him to the nearest town.

105
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:28,230
就是说得往回走大概至少37英里
Which would be at least 37 miles back the way you came.

106
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:34,070
第二条路 你们可以把镣铐解开 拿上那把枪
Or two: You could unshackle yourselves, take that rifle,

107
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:36,781
照着他脑袋上来一枪 然后把他倆的尸骨深埋
put a bullet in his head, bury the two of them deep,

108
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:40,493
然后找个更开化的地方扎根
and then make your way to a more enlightened area of this country.

109
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:42,745
供君选择
Choice is yours.

110
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:47,291
对了 考虑到你们识星象的几率略低
Oh, and on the off chance there are any astronomy aficionados amongst you,

111
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,461
北极星在那边
the North Star is that one.

112
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:55,091
拜拜啦
Ta-ta. 

113
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:13,984
等等 小伙子们 我们可以谈谈!
Now wait a minute, fellas. Let's talk about this!

114
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:21,033
你们得讲讲道理!
You gotta be reasonable in a situation like this!

115
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:25,496
我不是坏人 我只是本分地工作!
I'm not a bad guy. I'm just doin' my job!

116
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:29,250
蓝莓兄 我最后一个苹果不也给了你吗?
Blueberry, didn't I give you my last apple?

117
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:32,378
这样吧 孩子们 带我去埃尔帕索城看大夫
Tell you what, boys: Take me to the doc in El Paso,

118
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:34,588
我就放你们自由
I'll get you your freedom.

119
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:38,509
不 别 求你们了...
No. No, please...

120
00:12:54,755 --> 00:12:58,509
德州 多特里

121
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:25,222
好啦 听着
All right, now.

122
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:27,391
这个今天晚上吃两片...
I'd like you to take two of these tonight...

123
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:29,768
然后明早...
and then in the morning...

124
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:33,689
那匹马上有个黑鬼
That's a nigger on a horse.

125
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:01,091
他们都在看什么?
What's everybody staring at?

126
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,761
他们从来没见过骑着马的黑鬼
They ain't never seen no nigger on a horse before.

127
00:14:16,065 --> 00:14:17,066
吁
Whoa.

128
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,119
早安 老板!
Good morning, innkeeper!

129
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:32,915
给我们两个疲倦的旅人来两杯啤酒
Two beers for two weary travelers.

130
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:34,833
现在天色还早吧
It's still a bit early.

131
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,419
我们一个小时之后才开门
We won't be open for another hour.

132
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,421
那时候 我们才提供早餐
By then, we'll be servin' breakfast.

133
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:45,010
等等 等等 等等... 你这他妈的干什么呢?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... what the hell you think you're doing, boy?

134
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:47,263
把那黑鬼赶出去!
Get that nigger outta here!

135
00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:54,812
- 救命啊! 出大事啦!  - 老板!
- Help! Help!  - Innkeeper!

136
00:14:54,979 --> 00:14:58,148
记得 去叫警长 别叫成司法官了
Remember, get the sheriff, not the marshal.

137
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,192
警长! 救命啊!
Sheriff! Help!

138
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:01,986
哎
Alas.

139
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:05,906
我们现在得自己动手了 
Now we must act as our own bartender.

140
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,077
坐下吧 孩子
Sit down, my boy.

141
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,631
你是哪门子的牙医?
What kind of dentist are you?

142
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:28,053
别看那个小车 其实我有五年没出诊了
Despite that cart, I haven't practiced dentistry in five years.

143
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:35,978
但现在 我已经改行了...
But these days, I practice a new profession...

144
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,565
做赏金猎人
bounty hunter.

145
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:47,990
你知道什么叫赏金猎人吗?
Do you know what a bounty hunter is?

146
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:49,742
不知道
No.

147
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,118
好吧...
Well...

148
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:56,874
就跟奴隶买卖一样 拿人命换钱
the way the slave trade deals in human lives for cash,

149
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,376
赏金猎人是拿尸首换钱
a bounty hunter deals in corpses.

150
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:01,754
帽子
Hat.

151
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,051
干杯
Prost.

152
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,895
州里提名悬赏人头
The state places a bounty on a man's head.

153
00:16:18,062 --> 00:16:20,731
我追踪 锁定 然后了结他
I track that man, I find that man, I kill that man.

154
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:24,860
了结他之后 我再把他的尸首运回去鉴定
After I've killed him, I transport that man's corpse back to the authorities.

155
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:27,738
有时说比做可容易多了
Sometimes that's easier said than done.

156
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,699
我把尸首交给当局 确定一下
I show that corpse to the authorities, proving yes, indeed,

157
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:32,576
我亲手杀死了他
I truly have killed him,

158
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:35,746
然后当局再付给我相应的赏金
at which point the authorities pay me the bounty.

159
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:39,249
所以 就像奴隶买卖 人头换金钱
So, like slavery, it's a flesh for cash business.

160
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:41,877
什么是赏金?
What's a bounty?

161
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:47,132
就是奖赏
It's like a reward.

162
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:50,678
你杀人? 然后他们给你奖赏?
You kill people? And they give you a reward?

163
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,721
某些人 对
Certain people, yeah.

164
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:54,014
坏人?
Bad people?

165
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:58,143
对! 他们越坏 奖赏越多
Ah! Badder they are, bigger the reward.

166
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,604
然后我就找上了你
Which brings me to you.

167
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:05,025
我必须承认 对你呢 我有点进退两难
And I must admit, I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes to you.

168
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,611
一方面 我鄙视奴隶制度
On one hand, I despise slavery.

169
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:10,906
另一方面 我实在需要你的帮助
On the other hand, I need your help.

170
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:14,451
如果你不持反对意见的话 那就太好了
If you're not in a position to refuse, all the better.

171
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:17,996
所以 那时 我只能借奴隶买卖
So, for the time being, I'm gonna make this slavery malarkey

172
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:20,374
达到我自己的目的
work to my benefit.

173
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:25,212
不过 我已经说过了 我深感内疚
Still, having said that, I feel guilty.

174
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,136
因此 我想和你订个君子协议
So, I would like the two of us to enter into an agreement.

175
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:41,019
我在找布里托兄弟
I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.

176
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:47,025
但是 就算我再努力
However, at this endeavor,

177
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:52,322
不知对方相貌 我显然占了下风
I'm at a slight disadvantage insofar as I don't know what they look like.

178
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:56,452
但是你认得他们 对吧?
But you do. Don't ya?

179
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,829
我是认得他们的长相
I know what they look like all right.

180
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:02,499
好 我们就此协定
Good. So here's my agreement.

181
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:06,086
- 你陪同我 直到我们找到他们  - 我们去哪找?
- You travel with me until we find them.  - Where we goin'?

182
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,881
我听说他们其中至少两个在加特林堡做监工
I hear at least two of them are overseeing up in Gatlinburg,

183
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,216
但是我没有确切地点
but I don't know where.

184
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:15,679
所以我们要走遍加特林堡的农场去找
That means we visit every plantation in Gatlinburg till we find 'em.

185
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:21,101
找到他们之后 你把他们指认出来 然后我来了结他们
And when we find them, you point them out, and I kill them.

186
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:25,522
你只要这么做 我就答应给你自由
You do that, I agree to give you your freedom,

187
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:29,818
每个人头分你25块 一共75块
$25 per Brittle Brother. That's $75.

188
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:33,697
果然不出所料 警长来了
And, as if on cue, here comes the sheriff.

189
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:46,960
好啦 孩子们 闹够了吧 出来吧
OK, boys. Fun's over. Come on out.

190
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:54,176
好啦 都冷静
All right, folks, calm down.

191
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:56,929
都该干啥干啥去
Go about your business.

192
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:00,098
这俩小鬼很快就上路了
These jokers will be gone soon.

193
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:07,481
告诉我 为什么你们来我的镇子上惹麻烦?
Now, why y'all wanna come into my town and start trouble?

194
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:10,901
还吓坏了这些老实人
And scare all these nice people.

195
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:14,738
你们就没点正经事做吗?
You ain't got nothing better to do

196
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:18,116
净来我比尔·夏普的小镇瞎捣乱
than to come into Bill Sharp's town

197
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,536
简直是自取其辱
and show your ass?

198
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:32,798
你把我们警长怎么了?
What'd you just do to our sheriff?

199
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:46,436
你可以去叫司法官了
Now you can get the marshal.

200
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:50,274
司法官! 司法官!
Marshal! Marshal!

201
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,693
- 我们要不要进去等?  - 咱们走吧?
- Should we wait inside?  - Can we just leave?

202
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,069
你先请
After you.

203
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:00,742
把路对面的马车横着停边上 对着那家酒馆
Move that buckboard a long ways across the street from the saloon.

204
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,787
然后找六个人拿着来复枪蹲在车后面
I want six men, six rifles behind it.

205
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:06,123
两个人拿着来复枪上这边房顶
I want two men, two rifles up on this roof.

206
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,625
那边也上去两个
Two men, two rifles on that roof.

207
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:11,753
所有枪都指着那扇大门
All the barrels aimed at that front door.

208
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,923
来人把可怜的比尔抬走
Somebody get poor Bill outta the goddamn street.

209
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:18,260
酒吧里的歹徒你听着!
You in the saloon!

210
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:21,763
你们已经被上百把来复枪包围了
We got a hundred rifles aimed at every way out of that buildin'.

211
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:25,642
你们只有一次活着出来的机会
You got one chance to get out of this alive.

212
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,979
你和你的黑鬼现在就弃械投降
You and your nigger come out right now with your hands over your head,

213
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:31,106
就现在
and I mean right now.

214
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:35,652
是司法官大人亲自来接见我吗?
Is this the marshal I have the pleasure of addressing?

215
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,613
是的
Yes, it is.

216
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:39,865
我是美国司法官吉尔·塔图姆
This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.

217
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:42,326
无上荣幸 司法官大人
Na wunderbar, marshal.

218
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:46,413
我已经正如你说的
I have relieved myself of all weapons,

219
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,499
卸去了所有武器
and just as you have instructed,

220
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,336
我正在以投降的姿态
I am ready to step outside

221
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:56,590
向外面走来
with my hands raised above my head.

222
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,093
我相信我作为
I trust as a representative

223
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,639
美利坚合众国刑事司法体系的代表
of the criminal justice system of the United States of America,

224
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:09,645
在上法庭之前是不可以被你和你手下
I shan't be shot down in the street by either you or your deputies

225
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:12,648
乱枪打死在大街上的
before I've had my day in court.

226
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,150
你是说不可以像你对警长那样
You mean like you did our sheriff.

227
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:17,110
像条狗似的死在马路中央
Shot him down like a dog in the street.

228
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,613
对 我就是那个意思
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

229
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:25,452
你能以执法者的名义承诺 不把我像狗一样射杀在马路中央吗?
Do I have your word as a lawman not to shoot me down like a dog in the street?

230
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:32,042
好吧 尽管我们都想把你格杀勿论
Well, much as we'd all enjoy seeing something like that,

231
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:35,212
但我们还都是明察秋毫的
ain't nobody gonna cheat the hangman in my town.

232
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:39,216
好的 司法官 我们出来了
Fair enough, marshal. Here we come.

233
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:43,220
他们枪栓都拉得够紧的
They're a little tense out there.

234
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:46,848
你就别乱来 让我来跟他们说
So don't make any quick movements, and let me do the talking.

235
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:49,851
出来吧
Come ahead.

236
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,151
赤手空拳啦?
You unarmed?

237
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,028
是 我们都缴械了
Yes, indeed we are.

238
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:04,116
司法官塔图姆 我能不能向你和你的手下
Marshal Tatum, may I address you and your deputies,

239
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,243
还有在这的整个多特里镇的村民
and apparently the entire town of Daughtrey,

240
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,745
介绍刚刚发生的那场事故?
as to the incident that just occurred?

241
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,541
- 继续  - 多谢
- Go on.  - Thank you.

242
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,835
我的名字是金·舒尔茨医生
My name is Dr. King Schultz.

243
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:18,255
像你一样 司法官 我也是名执法人员
Like yourself, marshal, I'm a servant of the court.

244
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:21,842
那黄土中的尸首 比尔·夏普
The man lying dead in the dirt, who the good people of Daughtrey

245
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:26,096
这位多特里镇的平民选出的警长
saw fit to elect as their sheriff, who went by the name of Bill Sharp,

246
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:30,851
实际上真名是威拉德·佩克 是个通缉犯
is actually a wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck,

247
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:33,603
被悬赏200块
with a price on his head of $200.

248
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,732
不论生死
Now that's $200, dead or alive.

249
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,233
你说什么!
The hell, you say!

250
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,446
我也深知这是条令人不安的坏消息
I'm aware this is probably disconcerting news.

251
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:45,782
我敢打赌这个人是在大概两年前
But I'm willing to wager this man was elected sheriff

252
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:48,452
被选上当警长的?
sometime in the past two years?

253
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:50,370
对
Yeah.

254
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:53,957
我知道是因为这个人三年前 在德州卢博克市
I know this because three years ago, he was rustling cattle

255
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:57,586
BC科里根畜牧公司犯下了偷牛大罪
from the B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company of Lubbock, Texas.

256
00:22:57,753 --> 00:23:01,548
现在 我手拿的是由德州奥斯汀
Now, this is a warrant made out by

257
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:07,387
巡回法院亨利·亚伦·罗德缪法官签发的逮捕证
Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas.

258
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:09,264
你可以给他发个电报
You're encouraged to wire him.

259
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:14,478
他会证实我的说辞 揭开你已故的亲爱的警长的真面目
He'll back up who I am and who your dear departed sheriff was.

260
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:26,573
换句话说 司法官大人 你欠我200块
In other words, marshal, you owe me $200.

261
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,750
见鬼了
I'll be damned.

262
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,365
处理完布里托兄弟之后
After this Brittle business is behind us,

263
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:14,079
你会得到自由 还有75块进账...
you'll be a free man, with a horse, $75 in your back pocket...

264
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:18,291
之后你有什么打算?
What's your plan after that?

265
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:24,381
找到我的妻子 赎回她的自由
Find my wife, and buy her freedom.

266
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:31,513
姜戈 我还不知道你是已婚男士
Django, I had no idea you were a married man.

267
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:34,307
大部分奴隶都信婚姻?
Do most slaves believe in marriage?

268
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:38,061
反正我和我妻子信
Oh, me and my wife do.

269
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:42,399
卡鲁肯老头不信 所以我们 呃... 跑了出来
Old Man Carrucan didn't. That's why we, uh... we run off.

270
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:45,235
姜戈
Django.

271
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:48,488
姜戈 姜戈
Django, Django.

272
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:51,366
你胆子不小啊 姜戈
You got sand, Django.

273
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:53,952
这个孩子胆子不小
Boy's got sand.

274
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:58,874
我偏不喜欢有胆的黑鬼
I got no use for a nigger with sand.

275
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:04,087
在他脸这儿烙个代表逃跑的r字
I want you to burn a runaway "r" right here on his cheek.

276
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:05,297
那个女孩也烙上
And the girl, too.

277
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:12,220
然后把他们带到格林维尔卖场上卖掉
And I want you to take 'em to the Greenville auction and sell 'em.

278
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:14,931
两个都卖掉
Both of 'em.

279
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:16,850
分开卖
Separately.

280
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:20,645
这个嘛...
And this one...

281
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:25,984
我要你贱卖
you will sell him cheap.

282
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:29,446
在格林维尔...
In Greenville...

283
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,951
应该有个档案库
there should be some sort of a records office.

284
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:44,377
记录着她什么时候被卖掉的...
You know when she was sold...

285
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:48,798
还有她从哪来
you know where she came from,

286
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:50,800
以及她的名字
and you know her name.

287
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:53,136
她叫什么来着?
What is her name?

288
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:54,971
布隆希达
Broomhilda.

289
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:59,809
- 什么?  - 布隆 希达
- What?  - Broom-hilda.

290
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:01,937
- 布隆希达?  - 对的
- Broomhilda?  - Hm-mm.

291
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:07,025
- 她的主人是德国人?  - 对 你怎么知道的?
- Were her owners German?  - Yeah, how you know?

292
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:09,319
她不是在卡鲁肯农场出生的
She wasn't born on the Carrucan plantation.

293
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:12,030
她被德国女主人养大 沙夫特家
She was raised by a German mistress, the Von Shafts.

294
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:14,324
她也会说一点德语
She speak a little German, too.

295
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:16,243
- 你妻子?  - 嗯
- Your wife?  - Hm-mm.

296
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,245
她还小的时候 女主人教过她
When she was little, her mistress taught her so she'd have somebody

297
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:19,996
为了能有个人说说话
to speak German with.

298
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:24,167
好了 我来理一遍
Well, let me get this straight.

299
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:28,922
你的奴隶妻子会说德语 而且她叫布隆希达·沙夫特?
Your slave wife speaks German and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?

300
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:30,215
对
Yep.

301
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:37,013
他们叫我希达
They call me Hildi.

302
00:26:49,261 --> 00:26:51,013
田纳西州

303
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:59,286
进这些农场之后 我们要演场戏
When we gain access to these plantations, we'll be putting on an act.

304
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,373
你有自己的角色要扮演
You'll be playing a character.

305
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:11,381
怎么样?
Hm?

306
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,508
不好看啊?
No?

307
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:24,978
表演的时候 你不能出戏
During the act, you can never break character.

308
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:27,605
你明白么?
Do you understand?

309
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:30,900
嗯 不出戏
Yeah. Don't break character.

310
00:27:33,236 --> 00:27:37,157
你的角色就是随从
And your character is that of The Valet.

311
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:39,409
什么意思?
What that is?

312
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:42,704
说不好听的就是仆人
That's a fancy word for servant.

313
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:44,122
- 随从?  - 嗯
- Valet?  - Hm-mm.

314
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:50,128
现在嘛 姜戈 你可以为你的角色选戏服了
And now, Django, you may choose your character's costume.

315
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:54,382
你让我给我自己选衣服?
Youse gonna let me pick out my own clothes?

316
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:55,508
那是自然
But of course.

317
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:25,497
吁
Whoa.

318
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:33,380
在这里黑鬼骑马是犯法的
It's against the law for niggers to ride horses in this territory.

319
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:36,925
他是我的随从 他不走路的
This is my valet. My valet does not walk.

320
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:40,970
- 我是说在马上的这黑鬼...  - 他的名字是姜戈
- I said niggers on horses...  - His name is Django.

321
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:43,932
他是自由的 他想骑什么就骑什么
He's a free man. He can ride what he pleases.

322
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:47,560
在我的地盘可不行 至少在我的黑鬼面前 不行
Not on my property. Not around my niggers, he can't.

323
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:53,233
这位先生 我想我们误会了
My good sir, perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.

324
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,860
请容我解释
Allow me to unring this bell.

325
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:59,864
我是金·舒尔茨医生 这是我的随从姜戈
My name is Dr. King Schultz. This is my valet, Django.

326
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:02,158
这是我们的坐骑托尼和小德
And these are our horses, Tony and Fritz.

327
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,372
班尼特先生?
Mr. Bennett?

328
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:11,751
我听说您是一位绅士 也是位生意人
I've been led to believe that you are a gentleman and a businessman.

329
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:15,880
因此我们才骑马从德州来到了田纳西州
And it is for these attributes we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee

330
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:17,966
与您会面
to parley with you now.

331
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,096
我想从你这里买一个女奴
I wish to purchase one of your nigger gals.

332
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:27,725
你和你的小喽啰从德州来到田纳西
You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to Tennessee

333
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:29,686
就是为了买我一个女奴?
to buy one of my nigger gals?

334
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:31,521
不事先打个招呼 啥也没有就来了?
No appointment, no nothin'?

335
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:33,606
噢 的确如此
Oh, I'm afraid so.

336
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:36,192
嗯 那如果我说我不喜欢你呢?
Well, what if I was to say I don't like you?

337
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:38,027
还有你的小丑黑鬼?
Or your fancy-pants nigger?

338
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:40,405
我什么都不打算卖给你
And I wouldn't sell you a tinker's damn.

339
00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:42,532
你想说什么吗?
Now what you got to say about that?

340
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:47,787
班尼特先生
Mr. Bennett.

341
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:51,207
如果您真如传闻中说的那样具有商业头脑的话
If you are the businessman I've been led to believe you to be,

342
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:56,546
我有五千个理由可以改变您的想法
I have 5,000 things I might say that could change your mind.

343
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:04,220
哦 快进屋来喝点冷饮吧
Well, come on inside and get yourself somethin' cool to drink.

344
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:07,307
嗯
Hm-mm.

345
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:20,695
哦 我们谈生意的时候
Oh, maybe while we discuss business,

346
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:23,406
是否可以请您安排一个可爱的黑奴
you could provide one of your loveliest black creatures

347
00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:25,950
带姜戈上你这大农场四处转转呢
to escort Django here around your magnificent grounds.

348
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:28,286
哦 当然 没问题! 贝提娜
Oh, well, absolutely! Uh, Betina.

349
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:30,205
- 有啥吩咐 老爹?  - 呃...
- Yessir, Big Daddy?  - Uh...

350
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:32,248
你的小喽啰叫什么来着?
What's your Jimmie's name again?

351
00:30:32,415 --> 00:30:33,917
- 姜戈  - 对 姜戈
- Django.  - Django.

352
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,252
贝提娜 带着这位姜戈
Betina, sugar, could you take Django there

353
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:39,631
带他在周围转转看看我们的好东西
and take him around the grounds here and show him all the pretty stuff.

354
00:30:39,797 --> 00:30:41,090
遵命 老爹
As you please, Big Daddy.

355
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:45,178
哦 班尼特先生 请允许我提醒你一下 姜戈是个自由人
Oh, Mr. Bennett, I must remind you, Django is a free man.

356
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:48,681
他可不能被当作奴隶对待 他... 鉴于这里的气氛这么好
He cannot be treated like a slave. He... within the bounds of good taste,

357
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:51,351
他必须得到与我同等的对待
he must be treated as an extension of myself.

358
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:54,521
- 了解 舒尔茨 贝提娜亲爱的  - 有啥吩咐?
- Understood, Schultz. Betina, sugar?  - Yes'm?

359
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:59,317
姜戈不是奴隶 姜戈是自由人 你明白吗?
Django isn't a slave. Django is a free man, you understand?

360
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:02,820
你可不能像对待这里的其他黑鬼那样对待他
You can't treat him like any of the other niggers around here,

361
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:05,907
因为他与这里的其他黑鬼不一样 明白么?
'cause he ain't like any of the other niggers around here. You got it?

362
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:08,952
你让我像对待白人那样对待他?
You want I should treat him like white folks?

363
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:12,247
不 我没这么说
No. That's not what I said.

364
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:14,958
那你是什么意思呢 老爹
Then I don't know what you want, Big Daddy.

365
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:19,963
嗯 让我想想 呃...
Yes, I can see that. Uh...

366
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:24,592
那个从镇子里来的干活戴眼镜的伐木工叫什么名字来着?
What's the name of that peckerwood boy from town that works with the glass?

367
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:26,719
他妈在锯木场工作的那个
His mama work over at the lumberyard.

368
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:29,639
- 哦 你是说杰瑞  - 就是他 杰瑞!
- Oh, you mean Jerry.  - That's the boy's name. Jerry!

369
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:31,307
知道杰瑞吧 知道吗 亲爱的?
You know Jerry, don't you, sugar?

370
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:34,602
- 知道 老爹  - 那就好
- Yes'm, Big Daddy.  - Well, that's it, then.

371
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:37,730
你就像对待杰瑞那样对待他好了
You just treat him like you would Jerry.

372
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:47,407
我们刚离开的那屋子叫大房子
That house we just left from is The Big House.

373
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:50,493
因为它大所以老爹这么称呼它
Big Daddy call it that 'cause it's big.

374
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:53,830
那边是粮仓

老爹在那边晾干肉
That's where Big Daddy hang all his dead meat.

376
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,711
可怜的小松鼠们

377
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:03,840
你都为主人做些啥?
What you do for your massa?

378
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:05,758
你没听他说我不是奴隶吗?
Didn't you hear him tell you I ain't no slave?

379
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:08,344
- 你真的是自由人?  - 对 我是
- So you really free?  - Yes, I's free.

380
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:10,847
你是自己打扮成这样的?
You mean you wanna dress like that?

381

不认识
I don't know them.

387
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:30,950
他们也可能用假名字
They could be usin' a different name.

388
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:33,369
应该是去年来农场的
They woulda come to the plantation this past year.

00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:44,756
嗯 其中一个就在那边地里
Well, one's over in that field.

394
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:00,438
卡鲁肯老头子不会同意这么干的
Old Man Carrucan ain't gonna appreciate this, now.

395
00:33:00,605 --> 00:33:01,564
她是在屋里干活的 约翰
She work in the house, John.

You could mess her skin up, and you gonna mess her up

397
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:05,735

and she ain't gonna be worth... she ain't gonna be worth a damn thing.

398
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:07,779
你们的圣经不是说...
Now, your Bible say...

你知道卡鲁肯主人是不同意这样做的
You know Massa Carrucan ain't gonna appreciate this.

405
00:33:35,348 --> 00:33:36,974
她是在屋里伺候人的
She's a... she's a house slave.

406
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:40,561
她是在屋里伺候人的 她不能被...
She a house slave, she can't be...

407
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,417

On my knees. I'm asking you this, please. Ain't this what you want?

408

我喜欢你乞求的样子 小子
I like the way you beg, boy.

411
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,976
是你要找的人吗?
Is that who you was lookin' for?

412
00:34:21,811 --> 00:34:22,979
没错
Yep.

413
00:34:24,272 --> 00:34:25,565

422
00:34:51,716 --> 00:34:54,177
"耶和华说 凡你所惧怕的..."
"And the Lord said, The fear of ye..."

423
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:57,305
"和你所担忧的"
"and the dread of ye

424
00:34:57,472 --> 00:34:59,766
将应在大地上的一切野兽身上"
shall be on every beast of the earth."

427
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:24,624
好了 她准备好了!
OK, she's ready!

428
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:42,725
从今往后 看你还敢不敢打碎鸡蛋
And after this, we'll see if you break eggs again.

429
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:48,064
嘿 约翰·布里托!
John Brittle!

430
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:11,295
还记得我吗?
You remember me?

431

我喜欢你死掉的样子 小子
I like the way you die, boy.

432

434
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:19,447
你们想看好戏吗?
Y'all wanna see somethin'?

435
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,619
不!
No!

436
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:36,297
这俩是谁?
Who were they?

437
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:40,009
这是大约翰 这是小罗
That's Big John, and that's Lil Raj.

438
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:41,677
埃利斯呢?
Where's Ellis?

439
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:44,180
他正骑着高头大马在地里监工呢
He's the one high tailin' it across that field right now.

440
00:37:49,018 --> 00:37:50,519
- 真是他?  - 没错
- You sure that's him?  - Yeah.

441
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:52,605
- 确定吗?  - 不知道
- Positive?  - I don't know.

442
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:55,024
- 不知道能否确定?  - 不知道什么叫"确定"
- You don't know if you're positive?  - I don't know what "positive" mean.

443
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:56,442
- 你能肯定是他吗?  - 能
- It means you're sure.  - Yes.

444
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:58,903
- 能什么?  - 能肯定那就是埃利斯·布里托
- "Yes," what?  - Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.

445
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:13,709
我确定他死了
I'm positive he dead.

446
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:19,757
姜戈!
Django!

447
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,970
请大家冷静
Everybody calm down.

448
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:26,389
我们不会再造成伤亡
We mean no one else any harm.

449
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:28,099
你俩到底是什么人?
Who are you two jokers?

450
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:31,268
我是金·舒尔茨医生
I am Dr. King Schultz, a legal representative

451
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:34,105
美利坚合众国的刑事司法系统的法定代表
of the criminal justice system of the United States of America.

452
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:38,859
我左边这位是姜戈·弗里曼(自由人) 是我的助手
The man to my left is Django Freeman. He's my deputy.

453
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:40,987
我的口袋里有张逮捕证
In my pocket is a warrant,

454
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:45,241
是德州奥斯汀的巡回法院亨利·亚伦·罗德缪法官签发的
signed by Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas,

455
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:49,286
授权我抓捕这三个人 不论死活
for the arrest and capture, dead or alive,

456
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:54,458
他们是约翰·布里托 罗杰·布里托 和埃利斯·布里托
of John Brittle, Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle.

457
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,711
现在他们改姓了谢弗
They were goin' by the name Shaffer.

458
00:38:58,129 --> 00:39:02,258
你们认识的谢弗兄弟 其实这几个凶手姓布里托
You know them by the name of Shaffer, but the butchers' real name was Brittle.

459
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:04,093
他们是被通缉的人
These are wanted men.

460
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,720
他们的罪名是谋杀
The law wants 'em for murder.

461
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:10,016
现在 我重申一下 通缉令说死活不限
Now, I reiterate, the warrant states dead or alive,

462
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:13,477
因此弗里曼先生和我发现他们的踪迹
so when Mr. Freeman and myself executed these men on sight,

463
00:39:13,644 --> 00:39:17,106
并将他们击毙是依法办事
we were operating within our legal boundaries.

464
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:22,611
我知道你们对此很不高兴
I realize passions are high,

465
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:26,824
但是我必须警告你们
but I must warn you, the penalty for taking deadly force

466
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:29,368
对正在执法的执法者诉诸致命武力的人
against an officer of the court in the performance of his duty

467
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:33,456
将被判绞刑
is you'll be hung by the neck until you're dead.

468
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:41,213
现在 我可以从兜里拿出我的逮捕证好让你检查一下吗?
Now, may I please remove the warrant from my pocket so you may examine it?

469
00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:44,425
拿来
Gimme.

470
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:02,318
可以了吧?
Satisfied?

471
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:11,118
我能拿回来了吗 谢谢?
May I have that back, please?

472
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:19,835
- 离开我的地界  - 立即照办
- Get off my land.  - Posthaste.

473
00:40:20,503 --> 00:40:24,924
收拾好尸体 我们马上离开这里
Load up the bodies as quickly as you can and let's get outta here.

474
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:54,286
好极了 就那俩狗娘养的
Yeah, that's them sons-a-bitches.

475
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:35,578
冲啊 兄弟们!
Come on, men!

476
00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:41,292
- 我们是来弄死你的 黑鬼!  - 咦哈!
- We're coming for you, nigger!  - Hee-haw!

477
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:54,930
听好 除非他们先开枪 我们不能先开枪
Now, unless they start shootin' first, nobody shoot 'em.

478
00:41:55,097 --> 00:41:57,308
这两个家伙可不能这么轻易就死了
That's way too simple for these jokers.

479
00:41:58,058 --> 00:42:00,686
我们要抽死那个喜欢黑鬼的家伙
We're gonna whup that nigger-lover to death.

480
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:05,900
我要亲自撕碎那个死黑鬼
And I'm gonna personally strip and clip that garboon myself.

481
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:10,988
该死
Damn.

482
00:42:12,323 --> 00:42:14,950
戴着这个我啥都看不见了
I can't see fuckin' shit outta this thing.

483
00:42:15,868 --> 00:42:17,161
准备好了吗?
We ready or what?

484
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:19,705
噢等等 眼睛上这个洞要弄弄
Aw, hold on, I'm fuckin' with my eyeholes.

485
00:42:19,872 --> 00:42:22,249
噢... 哦 该死
Oh... Oh, shit.

486
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:24,627
弄得更糟了
I just made it worse.

487
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:26,837
这破玩意谁做的?
Who made this goddamn shit?

488
00:42:27,004 --> 00:42:29,965
- 威拉德的老婆弄的  - 怎么啦 嫌不好自己去做!
- Willard's wife.  - Well, make your own goddamn masks!

489
00:42:30,132 --> 00:42:33,719
瞧 大家很感激珍妮为我们做的一切
Look, nobody's sayin' they don't appreciate what Jenny did.

490
00:42:33,886 --> 00:42:36,472
不过 只不过是在口袋上弄两个眼儿出来
Well, if all I had to do was cut a hole in a bag,

491
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:38,307
要是我弄 肯定比这强!
I coulda cut it better than this!

492
00:42:38,474 --> 00:42:41,268
罗伯特 你怎么样? 能看到吗?
What about you, Robert? Can you see?

493
00:42:41,435 --> 00:42:42,645
勉强吧
Not too good.

494
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:47,149
我是说 脑袋不动的话多少还能看到些
I mean, if I don't move my head I can see you pretty good, more or less.

495
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:50,819
但是骑马跑起来 口袋就到处乱晃 两眼一抹黑
But when I start ridin', the bag's movin' all over, and I'm ridin' blind.

496
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:53,072
- 该死  - 就是
- Shit.  - Yeah.

497
00:42:53,614 --> 00:42:55,282
我把我的弄得更糟了
I just made mine worse.

498
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:57,243
天啊
Oh, God.

499
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:58,953
有人带了多余的口袋吗?
Anybody bring any extra bags?

500
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,081
没人带着多余的口袋!
No, nobody brought an extra bag!

501
00:43:02,248 --> 00:43:03,874
我就想问问
I'm just askin'.

502
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:05,834
骑马的时候一定要戴吗?
Do we have to wear 'em when we ride?

503
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:07,211
废话!
Oh, well, shitfire!

504
00:43:07,378 --> 00:43:10,464
骑马的时候不戴还有什么意义!
If you don't wear 'em as you ride up, that just defeats the purpose!

505
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:12,591
问题是戴着这个我什么都看不到!
Well, I can't see in this fuckin' thing!

506
00:43:12,758 --> 00:43:15,469
戴着这玩意我喘不过气啊 我不能戴着它骑马!
I can't breathe in this fuckin' thing and I can't ride in this fuckin' thing!

507
00:43:15,636 --> 00:43:18,055
谁管你们! 我要回家了!
Well, fuck all y'all! I'm goin' home!

508
00:43:18,222 --> 00:43:22,017
我老婆忙了一整天做了30个口袋
Now, I watched my wife work all day gettin' 30 bags together

509
00:43:22,184 --> 00:43:24,186
给你们这些不感恩的杂种
for you ungrateful sons-a-bitches,

510
00:43:24,353 --> 00:43:28,107
我听到除了抱怨就是抱怨还有抱怨!
and all I can hear is criticize, criticize, criticize!

511
00:43:28,274 --> 00:43:31,443
从今往后 别指望我帮你们办事了!
From now on, don't ask me or mine for nothin'!

512
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:35,614
听着 别忘了我们是来干嘛的
Now, look, let's not forget why we're here.

513
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:38,867
山那边有个黑鬼杀手呢!
We got a killer nigger over that hill there!

514
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:40,369
我们要给他点颜色看看
And we gotta make a lesson out of him.

515
00:43:40,536 --> 00:43:44,373
好吧 我有点乱 到底罩不罩口袋?
OK, I'm confused. Are the bags on or off?

516
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:49,336
我们不是一致认为罩口袋是好主意吗?
I think we all think the bag was a nice idea.

517
00:43:49,503 --> 00:43:50,462
好吧
Yeah.

518
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:54,717
不过 没有特指谁啊 这手艺可真不怎么样
But, not pointin' any fingers, they coulda been done better.

519
00:43:55,676 --> 00:43:59,388
那这次不戴可以吗
So how 'bout no bags this time,

520
00:43:59,555 --> 00:44:04,560
下次我们改良一下 再戴怎么样
but next time we do the bags right and then we go full regalia.

521
00:44:04,727 --> 00:44:06,729
- 这主意我喜欢  - 投你一票 罗伯特
- I like that idea a lot.  - You get my vote, Robert.

522
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:10,232
等等 我没说不罩口袋
Wait a minute! I didn't say no bags.

523
00:44:10,399 --> 00:44:12,401
但是大家都看不见啊
But nobody can see.

524
00:44:12,568 --> 00:44:13,652
那又怎么了?
So?

525
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:15,696
看得见比较好吧
So it'd be nice to see.

526
00:44:15,863 --> 00:44:20,617
该死的! 我们是突袭! 我看不到 你也看到不到!
Goddamn it! This is a raid! I can't see, you can't see!

527
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:26,165
那又怎么了? 该死的马能看到不就得了! 突袭吗不是!
So what? All that matters is can the fuckin' horse see! That's a raid!

528
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:31,628
根本看不清!
I can't see shit!

529
00:44:31,795 --> 00:44:35,424
他在这! 从车厢下面把那黑鬼拖出来!
There he is! Get that nigger out from under that wagon!

530
00:44:36,258 --> 00:44:38,260
从车里把黑鬼爱好者也弄出来!
And get that nigger-lover outta the wagon!

531
00:44:38,427 --> 00:44:40,054
黑鬼不在这里 老爹!
That nigger ain't down here, Big Daddy!

532
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,638
- 什么?  - 他们耍了我们!
- What?  - They tricked us!

533
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:42,848
那 那他们在哪?
Well, where are they?

534
00:44:43,015 --> 00:44:44,433
再会
Auf Wiedersehen.

535
00:44:50,147 --> 00:44:51,940
噢!
Oh!

536
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:53,150
十环
Bull's-eye.

537
00:44:56,153 --> 00:44:59,448
他们逃跑了
Look at 'em run.

538
00:45:02,076 --> 00:45:04,661
一群懦夫就是这样
Yeah, cowards tend to do that.

539
00:45:04,828 --> 00:45:06,789
该死的!
Goddamn it!

540
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,171
该死的!
Goddamn it!

541
00:45:18,801 --> 00:45:20,511
你来试试?
Would you care to?

542
00:45:27,309 --> 00:45:29,144
罩着这玩意什么都看不到!
Can't see shit outta this!

543
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:31,939
- 他要逃了  - 我瞄到了
- He's getting away.  - I got him.

544
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:35,442
老爹要逃了
Big Daddy's getting away.

545
00:45:35,609 --> 00:45:36,860
我瞄准了
I got him.

546
00:45:52,126 --> 00:45:53,168
干掉他了
Got him.

547
00:45:58,006 --> 00:46:01,009
很有天赋啊
The kid's a natural.

548
00:46:11,687 --> 00:46:15,482
你怎么知道布隆希达的第一个主人是德国人?
How you know Broomhilda's first masters was German?

549
00:46:15,649 --> 00:46:17,901
布隆希达是个德国名字
Broomhilda is a German name.

550
00:46:18,068 --> 00:46:20,779
既然给她起这个名字 他们应该是德国人
If they named her, it stands to reason they'd be German.

551
00:46:20,946 --> 00:46:23,198
你们那里很多女孩都叫布隆希达吗?
Lots of gals where you're from named Broomhilda?

552
00:46:23,991 --> 00:46:26,952
布隆希达在德国是一个家喻户晓的名字
Broomhilda is the name of a character

553
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,039
她是一个德国传说中的人物
in the most popular of all the German legends.

554
00:46:31,206 --> 00:46:33,167
布隆希达还有个故事?
There's a story about Broomhilda?

555
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:35,043
是的 有个故事
Oh, yes, there is.

556
00:46:41,091 --> 00:46:44,553
- 你知道这故事?  - 每个德国人都知道
- Do you know it?  - Oh, every German knows that story.

557
00:46:50,976 --> 00:46:52,352
想让我给你讲讲?
Would you like me to tell you?

558
00:46:53,854 --> 00:46:59,860
嗯 布隆希达是个公主
Well, Broomhilda was a princess.

559
00:47:01,695 --> 00:47:05,782
她是万神之神沃坦的女儿
She was a daughter of Wotan, god of all gods.

560
00:47:06,825 --> 00:47:10,037
不过 她父亲对她很恼火
Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

561
00:47:10,204 --> 00:47:11,455
她干什么了?
What she do?

562
00:47:12,414 --> 00:47:13,874
记不清了
I can't exactly remember.

563
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:16,710
反正就是违抗了他父亲的命令
She disobeys him in some way.

564
00:47:16,877 --> 00:47:20,047
所以他把关在一座山的山顶
So he puts her on top of the mountain.

565
00:47:20,714 --> 00:47:21,840
布隆希达在山里?
Broomhilda's on a mountain?

566
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:23,258
这是德国传说
It's a German legend,

567
00:47:23,425 --> 00:47:26,220
总是有个山什么的
there's always going to be a mountain in there somewhere.

568
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:30,432
他还安排了喷火龙守卫那座山
And he puts a fire-breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.

569
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:37,189
用地狱之火围绕着她
And he surrounds her in a circle of hellfire.

570
00:47:38,649 --> 00:47:42,986
因此 布隆希达只好那么待着
And there, Broomhilda shall remain.

571
00:47:44,279 --> 00:47:49,576
除非有一位勇士能来拯救她
Unless a hero arises brave enough to save her.

572
00:47:50,661 --> 00:47:52,246
有么?
Does a fella arise?

573
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:55,374
有啊 姜戈 实际上 他真的去了
Yes, Django, as a matter of fact, he does.

574
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:57,584
一个叫齐格弗里德的小伙子
A fella named Siegfried.

575
00:47:58,293 --> 00:47:59,294
齐格弗里德救到她了吗?
Does Siegfried save her?

576
00:48:01,463 --> 00:48:04,091
他做到了 很了不起
Quite spectacularly so.

577
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:09,263
他爬上了大山 因为他无所畏惧
He scales the mountain, because he's not afraid of it.

578
00:48:09,972 --> 00:48:14,142
他杀死了恶龙 因为他无所畏惧
He slays the dragon, because he's not afraid of him.

579
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:16,812
他穿越了地狱之火...
And he walks through hellfire...

580
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:21,525
因为布隆希达值得这么做
because Broomhilda's worth it.

581
00:48:25,654 --> 00:48:27,322
我了解他的感觉
I know how he feel.

582
00:48:28,782 --> 00:48:31,660
我觉得我刚刚才了解到
I think I'm just starting to realize that.

583
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:41,336
嗯 听着 姜戈...
Now, look, Django...

584
00:48:44,256 --> 00:48:48,302
我毫不怀疑你会去拯救你的爱人...
I don't doubt that one day you'll save your lady love...

585
00:48:49,428 --> 00:48:53,015
但我从心里不希望你去格林维尔
but I can't let you go to Greenville in a good conscience.

586
00:48:54,057 --> 00:48:58,520
密西西比的奴隶市场可不适合你啊
A slave auction town in Mississippi isn't the place for you to visit.

587
00:48:58,687 --> 00:49:01,565
不论你是不是自由人 那都很危险
Free or not, it's just too dangerous.

588
00:49:04,526 --> 00:49:06,695
让我来问你一个问题
But let me ask you a question.

589
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:16,622
你喜欢当赏金猎人吗?
How do you like the bounty hunting business?

590
00:49:18,123 --> 00:49:20,459
杀白人还有钱拿?
Kill white folks and they pay you for it?

591
00:49:21,293 --> 00:49:22,628
怎么会不喜欢?
What's not to like?

592
00:49:22,794 --> 00:49:25,213
我得承认 我俩搭档很不错
Now, I have to admit, we make a good team.

593
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:28,216
我以为我杀了大约翰和小罗让你很不高兴呢
I thought you was mad at me for killin' Big John and Lil Raj.

594
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:30,469
没错 那种场合下你是有点过分了
Yeah, on that occasion you were a tad overzealous,

595
00:49:30,636 --> 00:49:32,596
不过一般来说 那也没什么
but normally, that's a good thing.

596
00:49:33,388 --> 00:49:35,599
我们搭伙干一个冬天怎么样?
How'd you like to partner up for the winter?

597
00:49:35,766 --> 00:49:37,768
搭伙是什么意思?
What you mean "partner up"?

598
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:42,230
整个冬天直到冰雪融化你跟着我...
You work with me through the winter till the snow melts...

599
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:45,233
奖金我分你三分之一
I give you a third of my bounties.

600
00:49:46,443 --> 00:49:50,364
我们这个冬天赚些钱 等雪化了
So we make some money this winter, and when the snow melts,

601
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:53,450
我亲自带你去格林维尔
I'll take you to Greenville myself

602
00:49:53,617 --> 00:49:56,828
我们去找你妻子的下落
and we'll find where they sent your wife.

603
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:02,834
你为什么这么关心我?
Why you care what happen to me?

604
00:50:04,586 --> 00:50:06,546
为什么关心我是否找得到妻子?
Why you care if I find my wife?

605
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:08,090
坦白说...
Frankly...

606
00:50:09,383 --> 00:50:12,260
我从没有给过谁自由之身
I've never given anybody their freedom before.

607
00:50:12,427 --> 00:50:16,264
现在我给了你自由 我觉得我对你负有一定的责任
And now that I have, I feel vaguely responsible for you.

608
00:50:17,516 --> 00:50:21,228
再说 一个德国人遇到了现实中的齐格弗里德 没理由不帮一把的
Plus, when a German meets a real life Siegfried, that's kind of a big deal.

609
00:50:23,772 --> 00:50:26,650
作为一个德国人 我有义务帮你
As a German, I'm obliged to help you on your quest

610
00:50:26,817 --> 00:50:29,444
拯救你的爱人布隆希达
to rescue your beloved Broomhilda.

611
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:39,741
注意点
You got her.

612
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:51,461
哦 杀白人挣钱先生 你怎么了?
Ooh. What happened to Mr. "I Wanna Shoot White Folks For Money"?

613
00:52:51,628 --> 00:52:54,339
- 他儿子也在那  - 嗯 很好
- His son's with him.  - Well, good.

614
00:52:54,506 --> 00:52:56,091
他有个挚爱亲人在身边
He'll have a loved one with him.

615
00:52:56,258 --> 00:52:58,760
也许还能留句遗言
Maybe even share a last word.

616
00:53:00,762 --> 00:53:02,806
比其他人强多了
That's better than most of them get.

617
00:53:02,973 --> 00:53:05,267
坏人不应该有这种好报
Damn sight better than he deserves.

618
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:14,776
枪放下吧
Put down the rifle.

619
00:53:17,779 --> 00:53:19,489
别怕 我没生你的气
Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.

620
00:53:20,282 --> 00:53:22,617
我们拿出斯密·巴考尔的通缉令
Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.

621
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:28,081
大声读出来
Read it aloud.

622
00:53:28,957 --> 00:53:30,750
就当是今天的功课
Consider that today's lesson.

623
00:53:33,169 --> 00:53:35,839
通缉 无论死活
Wanted. Dead or alive.

624
00:53:36,798 --> 00:53:40,719
斯密·巴考尔以及斯密·巴考尔的
Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall

625
00:53:40,886 --> 00:53:43,138
- 团伙  - 团伙
- Gang.  - Gang.

626
00:53:43,305 --> 00:53:46,975
因谋杀以及打劫...
For murder and stagecoach...

627
00:53:48,393 --> 00:53:49,936
驿站马车
robbery.

628
00:53:50,103 --> 00:53:52,898
- 七 零 零 零...  - 七千
- Seven-zero-zero-zero...  - Seven thousand.

629
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:54,399
千
Thousand.

630
00:53:54,566 --> 00:53:58,778
悬赏七千美元捉拿斯密·巴考尔
$7,000 for Smitty Bacall.

631
00:53:58,945 --> 00:54:04,034
一千五百美元捉拿他的每个...
$1,500 for each of his...

632
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,994
团伙...
gang...

633
00:54:07,037 --> 00:54:09,039
- 成...  - 成员
- Mem...  - Members.

634
00:54:09,748 --> 00:54:14,377
已知的斯密·巴考尔团伙成员于下:
Known members of the Smitty Bacall Gang are as follas:

635
00:54:14,544 --> 00:54:16,296
- 如下  - 如下
- Follows.  - Follows.

636
00:54:16,463 --> 00:54:20,175
丹迪·迈克尔斯 杰拉尔德·纳什和...
Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash and...

637
00:54:21,301 --> 00:54:23,219
疯子克雷格·昆斯
Crazy Craig Koons.

638
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:26,473
这才是斯密·巴考尔的真面目
That is who Smitty Bacall is.

639
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,517
他要是22岁开始老实经营农场
If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at 22,

640
00:54:29,684 --> 00:54:31,645
就不会被印在这上面了
they would never have printed that.

641
00:54:32,354 --> 00:54:35,774
可斯密·巴考尔想抢劫马车
But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches

642
00:54:35,941 --> 00:54:38,360
为达目的他不惜杀人
and he didn't mind killing people to do it.

643
00:54:39,027 --> 00:54:42,364
你想做我的工作来挣钱救你妻子吗?
Do you want to save your wife by doing what I do?

644
00:54:43,615 --> 00:54:45,075
这就是我的工作
This is what I do.

645
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:48,787
我杀人 用尸体换赏金
I kill people and sell their corpses for cash.

646
00:54:49,704 --> 00:54:53,500
这具尸体值七千美元
This corpse is worth $7,000.

647
00:54:53,667 --> 00:54:55,877
别婆婆妈妈了 朝他开枪
Now quit your pussyfooting and shoot him.

648
00:55:06,012 --> 00:55:07,389
爸爸?
Pa?

649
00:55:07,555 --> 00:55:08,890
爸爸!
Pa!

650
00:55:17,357 --> 00:55:19,067
拿着
Here.

651
00:55:19,234 --> 00:55:21,319
你得保管好这斯密·巴考尔的通缉令
You need to keep this Smitty Bacall handbill.

652
00:55:21,486 --> 00:55:23,571
- 为什么?  - 这是好运气
- Why?  - It's good luck.

653
00:55:23,738 --> 00:55:26,533
要保存好第一份赏金通缉令
You always keep the handbill of your first bounty.

654
00:56:14,456 --> 00:56:15,874
非常准
That's accurate.

655
00:57:24,192 --> 00:57:27,320
医生 姜戈 你们好啊?
Doctor, Django, how the hell are ya?

656
00:57:28,363 --> 00:57:30,532
那些又是谁啊?
Who the hell-a you got there?

657
00:57:30,698 --> 00:57:32,659
威尔逊劳团伙
The Wilson-Lowe Gang.

658
00:57:32,826 --> 00:57:35,829
什么威尔逊劳团伙?
Who the hell is the Wilson-Lowe Gang?

659
00:57:36,538 --> 00:57:41,084
坏蛋查克·威尔逊 更坏的鲍比·劳和三个随从
Bad Chuck Wilson and meaner Bobby Lowe and three of their acolytes.

660
00:57:41,251 --> 00:57:44,879
哦 就放这儿吧 他们也跑不了了
Huh. Well, just leave 'em out here, they ain't going nowhere.

661
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:47,423
你们别在雪里待着 进屋来
Why don't you come in then out of the snowy snow

662
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:49,425
喝点咖啡
and get yourselves some coffee.

663
00:57:49,592 --> 00:57:52,137
昨天有人过生日 剩了点蛋糕
We had a birthday yesterday. Got some cake.

664
00:57:52,303 --> 00:57:53,721
相当不错的蛋糕
Pretty good.

665
00:58:04,303 --> 00:58:07,721
在一个寒冷但收获颇丰的冬天后

666
00:58:07,803 --> 00:58:10,721
姜戈和舒尔茨医生双双下山 去往...

667
00:58:15,869 --> 00:58:18,204
往前走!
Move along!

668
00:58:18,803 --> 00:58:21,721
密西西比州

669
00:58:23,543 --> 00:58:25,628
走啊 黑鬼!
Move it, boy!

670
00:58:27,172 --> 00:58:28,423
跟上了
Keep movin'.

671
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:30,550
到那个拍卖台上去
Get on up on that auction block.

672
00:58:32,093 --> 00:58:34,470
别让泥土拖慢你们的步伐 继续前进
Don't let that mud slow you down. Keep going.

673
00:58:50,904 --> 00:58:52,155
继续前行!
Keep goin'!

674
00:58:54,616 --> 00:58:58,536
"布隆希达·沙夫特 27岁
"Broomhilda Von Shaft. Age 27,

675
00:58:58,703 --> 00:59:00,121
右脸有'r'型标志"
'r' on right cheek."

676
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:04,042
卖给了卡尔文·坎迪
Calvin Candie.

677
00:59:04,209 --> 00:59:08,630
他拥有密西西比第四大棉花种植园: 糖果农场
He owns the fourth biggest cotton plantation in Mississippi: Candyland.

678
00:59:08,796 --> 00:59:10,131
糖果农场?
Candyland?

679
00:59:10,298 --> 00:59:11,382
哦 那你听说过了
Oh, so you've heard of it.

680
00:59:11,549 --> 00:59:13,635
没有哪个奴隶不知道糖果农场
Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.

681
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:16,471
那么 很显然 你妻子就在那...
Well, apparently, that's where your wife is...

682
00:59:16,638 --> 00:59:18,306
这就是她讨厌的主人
and that's the repellant gentleman

683
00:59:18,473 --> 00:59:22,018
希望她在房子里工作 而不是在田地里
who owns her. Let's just hope she works in the house, not in the field.

684
00:59:22,185 --> 00:59:24,312
哦 不 她不会在田地干活的
Oh, no, she ain't no field nigger.

685
00:59:24,479 --> 00:59:26,481
她... 她很漂亮
She... she pretty.

686
00:59:27,148 --> 00:59:29,067
而且也很会说话
And she talk good, too.

687
00:59:30,652 --> 00:59:32,445
但他们鞭打了她后背 然后...
But when they tore her back up and then they...

688
00:59:33,655 --> 00:59:35,823
还在她的脸上印了逃跑的"r"字母...
burned that runaway "r" on her cheek...

689
00:59:37,242 --> 00:59:38,409
他们诅咒了她
they goddamned her.

690
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:44,499
她不是田农 但也没好到
She ain't no field nigger but she ain't good enough

691
00:59:44,666 --> 00:59:46,668
可以料理房内家务
for the house no more either.

692
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:48,127
他们肯定会让她做情妇
They gonna try to make her a comfort girl.

693
00:59:48,294 --> 00:59:50,171
什么是情...? 噢
What's a comfort...? Oh.

694
00:59:51,089 --> 00:59:52,382
我有自由就绝对不容许
Not while I got freedom.

695
00:59:53,967 --> 00:59:55,760
我有了枪也绝不容许
Not while I got my gun.

696
00:59:58,846 --> 01:00:00,556
那我们要出价买她?
So do we offer to buy her?

697
01:00:03,184 --> 01:00:04,560
那么...
So...

698
01:00:06,145 --> 01:00:07,814
假设...
say...

699
01:00:09,983 --> 01:00:13,194
一个人想买马
a man wants to buy a horse.

700
01:00:13,361 --> 01:00:15,405
得买一匹马
Needs to buy a horse.

701
01:00:16,364 --> 01:00:19,325
他走向农场 敲场主的门
He walks up to the farmer's farm, and he knocks on the farmer's door

702
01:00:19,492 --> 01:00:21,160
问场主买马
and asks the farmer to buy his horse.

703
01:00:21,327 --> 01:00:23,121
你知道主人怎么说吗?
And do you know what the farmer says?

704
01:00:23,288 --> 01:00:25,498
他会拒绝
The farmer says no.

705
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,963
那我说去他妈的场主 我要偷那匹马
Well, I say fuck that farmer, and I'm stealin' that horse.

706
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:36,259
有道理 但那样你就成了窃马贼 会被绞死的
Fair enough. But now you're a horse thief, and they hang horse thieves.

707
01:00:36,426 --> 01:00:38,553
更别说马儿还是会回到主人身边
Not to mention the horse goes back to its original owner

708
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,346
因为马仍是他的财产
because the horse is still his property.

709
01:00:40,513 --> 01:00:44,392
我们需要她 也要一张卖身契
We need her and we need a bill of sale.

710
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:46,853
那如果我们不买她 该如何得到?
Well, if we ain't gonna try to buy her, then how we gonna get her?

711
01:00:47,937 --> 01:00:51,524
我可以提供B计划吗?
May I offer an alternative plan of action?

712
01:00:51,691 --> 01:00:53,192
说吧
Go ahead.

713
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:57,905
那么... 他走向农场
So... the man walks up to the farmer's farm,

714
01:00:58,072 --> 01:00:59,615
敲农场主的门...
he knocks on the farmer's door...

715
01:01:00,325 --> 01:01:05,371
向场主买农场 而不是马
and asks not to buy the horse, but the farm.

716
01:01:05,538 --> 01:01:08,916
开出个惊天报价
And makes an offer so ridiculous,

717
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:11,878
场主就不得不答应了
the farmer is forced to say yes.

718
01:01:12,754 --> 01:01:15,506
- 我们说买糖果农场?  - 不 那太贵了
- We gonna offer to buy Candyland?  - No, it's far too big.

719
01:01:15,673 --> 01:01:18,926
但显然 农场不是这位场主的全部
But apparently this farmer ain't all about the farm.

720
01:01:20,386 --> 01:01:22,430
你对曼丁哥拳击了解多少?
How much do you know about Mandingo fighting?

721
01:01:22,597 --> 01:01:23,598
什么?
What?

722
01:01:23,765 --> 01:01:26,601
你能不能巧妙伪装成
Can you convincingly masquerade as someone

723
01:01:26,768 --> 01:01:28,436
曼丁哥拳击的高手?
who is an expert on Mandingo fighting?

724
01:01:28,603 --> 01:01:29,645
为什么?
Why?

725
01:01:29,812 --> 01:01:33,441
因为我要扮演一个来自杜塞尔多夫的阔绰买家
Because my character is that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf,

726
01:01:33,608 --> 01:01:37,028
到格林维尔想买通进入曼丁哥拳击的道路
here in Greenville to buy my way into the Mandingo fight game.

727
01:01:37,195 --> 01:01:41,115
你要扮演我聘请来的曼丁哥专家
And your character is a Mandingo expert I hired to help me do it.

728
01:01:41,282 --> 01:01:43,242
人们叫他"独眼查理"
They call that "One-Eyed Charley."

729
01:01:46,329 --> 01:01:47,789
您好
Bonjour.

730
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:53,795
我们是来见卡尔文·坎迪先生的
We're here to see Mr. Calvin Candie.

731
01:01:53,961 --> 01:01:55,546
请进
Entraz.

732
01:01:58,049 --> 01:01:59,509
- 谢谢你  - 嗯哼
- Thank you.  - Hm-mm.

733
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:03,179
你要我扮演奴隶贩?
You want me to play a black slaver?

734
01:02:03,346 --> 01:02:06,015
没什么比黑奴贩更低贱了
Ain't nothin' lower than a black slaver.

735
01:02:06,182 --> 01:02:09,644
黑奴贩要比黑人管家还低下...
A black slaver is lower than the head house nigger...

736
01:02:10,311 --> 01:02:12,438
哥们 那可够低贱的
and, buddy, that's pretty fuckin' low.

737
01:02:13,564 --> 01:02:15,566
那就照那样子演
Then play him that way.

738
01:02:15,733 --> 01:02:19,779
把你奴隶贩那一面展示出来
Give me your black slaver.

739
01:02:22,448 --> 01:02:27,412
219路的嘟嘟声也来了! 花生酱!
Along came the 219 Toot! Toot! Peanut butter!

740
01:02:31,165 --> 01:02:33,042
舒尔茨医生!
Dr. Schultz!

741
01:02:33,209 --> 01:02:36,421
- 再次见面太高兴了!  - 莫吉先生
- Good to see you again!  - Mr. Moguy.

742
01:02:36,587 --> 01:02:39,382
感谢你帮我营造机会
Thank you for your assistance in creating the opportunity

743
01:02:39,549 --> 01:02:42,343
- 能有这次会面  - 何足挂齿 是我该做的
- for this appointment.  - Nonsense, it's my job.

744
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:45,346
那么这就是我久仰大名的独眼查理了
So this is the One-Eyed Charley I've heard so much about.

745
01:02:45,513 --> 01:02:47,932
是的 这位是姜戈·弗里曼
Yes, this is Django Freeman.

746
01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:50,768
姜戈 这是坎迪先生的律师 莱奥妮德·莫吉先生
Django, this is Mr. Candie's lawyer, Leonide Moguy.

747
01:02:50,935 --> 01:02:52,895
叫我莱奥就行了
Just call me Leo.

748
01:02:53,062 --> 01:02:56,232
卡尔文在凯撒大帝室 你要跟我来吗?
Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room. You all wanna follow me?

749
01:02:56,399 --> 01:02:58,693
你和坎迪先生共事多久了?
How long have you been associated with Mr. Candie?

750
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:01,320
哦 大约11岁时 我和卡尔文的父亲
Oh, Calvin's father and I were about 11

751
01:03:01,487 --> 01:03:03,281
一起去读的寄宿学校
when we went to boarding school together.

752
01:03:03,448 --> 01:03:06,534
卡尔文的爷爷安排我进法学院
Calvin's father's father put me through law school.

753
01:03:06,701 --> 01:03:09,704
只能说我是注定要成为卡尔文家的律师
One could almost say I was raised to be Calvin's lawyer.

754
01:03:09,871 --> 01:03:11,622
也可以说你是个黑鬼
One could almost say youse a nigger.

755
01:03:12,498 --> 01:03:13,916
你说什么?
What did you say?

756
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:16,836
- 我说...  - 没什么 他就是莽撞了点
- I said...  - Nothing, he's just being cheeky.

757
01:03:17,378 --> 01:03:21,799
见坎迪先生之前 还有我应该知道的其他事情吗?
Uh, anything else about Mr. Candie that I should know before I meet him?

758
01:03:21,966 --> 01:03:23,968
有 他有点法国崇拜
Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.

759
01:03:24,135 --> 01:03:25,928
哪个文明人不是呢?
What civilized people aren't?

760
01:03:26,095 --> 01:03:28,347
比起坎迪先生他更喜欢法语式的先生坎迪
And he prefers Monsieur Candie to Mr. Candie.

761
01:03:29,095 --> 01:03:30,847
随他的意愿啦(法语)

762
01:03:31,142 --> 01:03:35,146
他不会说法语 别跟他说法语 会使他难堪
He doesn't speak French. Don't speak French to him, it'll embarrass him.

763
01:03:38,065 --> 01:03:40,318
快站起身来! 转过身!
Get back on top, now! Turn around!

764
01:03:40,485 --> 01:03:41,986
就这样
There you go.

765
01:03:42,153 --> 01:03:43,779
就是这样
There you go.

766
01:03:45,656 --> 01:03:47,909
你为什么想介入曼丁哥生意?
Why do you want to get in the Mandingo business?

767
01:03:50,745 --> 01:03:54,499
你不打算让你的副手做个适当的介绍吗?
You don't intend to allow your second to make the proper introductions?

768
01:03:55,249 --> 01:03:57,126
别拖延时间
Quit stalling, now.

769
01:03:57,293 --> 01:03:58,628
回答我的问题
Answer the question.

770
01:04:01,297 --> 01:04:04,717
无奈的真相? 我很无聊
The awful truth? I'm bored.

771
01:04:04,884 --> 01:04:07,261
这看起来有点意思
This seems like a good bit of fun.

772
01:04:12,183 --> 01:04:14,185
好吧 过来
Well, come on over.

773
01:04:14,352 --> 01:04:17,063
我们正有个有趣的搏斗呢
We got us a fight goin' on that's a good bit of fun.

774
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:22,568
你陪我到吧台好吗?
Won't you accompany me to the bar?

775
01:04:31,827 --> 01:04:33,829
白人 在房间里要脱帽 连我都知道的
You don't wear a hat in the house, white man. Even I know that.

776
01:04:43,381 --> 01:04:44,799
- 舒尔茨医生  - 何其荣幸啊
- Dr. Schultz.  - What a rare pleasure.

777
01:04:44,966 --> 01:04:46,384
继续战斗 黑鬼
Keep fighting, niggers.

778
01:04:46,551 --> 01:04:49,345
- 我要补上 是荣誉  - 见到你是我的光荣
- And I might add, an honor.  - Honor to meet you.

779
01:04:49,512 --> 01:04:51,430
请坐 是我的荣幸
Please have a seat, the pleasure's all mine.

780
01:04:51,597 --> 01:04:55,101
自由人姜戈要什么就给他什么
Get free man Django here whatever he wants.

781
01:04:55,268 --> 01:04:57,562
我要甜茶和波旁酒
And I'll have sweet tea and bourbon.

782
01:05:17,206 --> 01:05:20,251
黑鬼 用你的体重优势! 就是这样
Use your weight, boy, use your weight! There you go.

783
01:05:20,418 --> 01:05:22,670
他更高更壮!
He's much bigger and stronger!

784
01:05:22,837 --> 01:05:24,422
快点!
Come on, now!

785
01:05:24,589 --> 01:05:27,091
他不按我说的做 天啊
He's not doing what I told him, for God's sakes.

786
01:05:31,178 --> 01:05:33,973
快一点 黑鬼! 这是生死之争!
Come on, now, boy! It's a fight to the death!

787
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:37,226
你到底要不要打败他?
You either hit him or are you ain't?

788
01:05:45,234 --> 01:05:48,321
- 大块头弗雷德 加把劲!
- Big Fred, come on!

789
01:05:48,487 --> 01:05:50,031
把他转过来! 马上...
Turn him around! Now...

790
01:05:53,826 --> 01:05:58,164
黑鬼 利用你的优势! 加把劲儿啊! 发挥你的强项!
Use your strength, boy! Come on, now! Use your strength!

791
01:06:00,249 --> 01:06:02,043
就这样!
There you go!

792
01:06:03,377 --> 01:06:05,838
就是这样! 看看
There you go! Look at that.

793
01:06:06,922 --> 01:06:09,884
看吧 我告诉你要更用力
See, I told you to put some more power in there.

794
01:06:10,051 --> 01:06:12,094
按我说的做 黑鬼!
Do what I told you, boy!

795
01:06:12,261 --> 01:06:13,721
就这样!
There you go!

796
01:06:13,888 --> 01:06:16,182
- 不!  - 照我说的来!
- No!  - Do what I told ya!

797
01:06:16,349 --> 01:06:19,393
把他戳瞎 黑鬼! 戳瞎他!
Blind him black, boy! Blind him black!

798
01:06:21,812 --> 01:06:24,315
哦 不 路易吉
Oh, no, Luigi.

799
01:06:27,526 --> 01:06:31,447
哇! 哦 哈哈!
Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

800
01:06:32,073 --> 01:06:33,240
噢...
Oh...

801
01:06:43,793 --> 01:06:45,086
把他了结
Finish him.

802
01:06:49,382 --> 01:06:51,133
继续啊 了结了他!
Go on, boy, finish him!

803
01:06:55,638 --> 01:06:57,348
这就是他被叫作大块头弗雷德的原因
That's why they call him Big Fred.

804
01:06:57,515 --> 01:07:00,935
- 花的每分钱都值得  - 好吧 路易吉再见
- Worth every penny.  - Well, arrivederci, Luigi.

805
01:07:01,102 --> 01:07:03,312
现在上来吧 休息一下
Come on up, now, boy. Get yourself a rest.

806
01:07:03,479 --> 01:07:06,482
你做的很好 相当好
You did a fine job. A real fine job.

807
01:07:07,108 --> 01:07:08,818
默西迪丝
Mercedes.

808
01:07:29,922 --> 01:07:31,132
我要龙舌兰酒
Tequila.

809
01:07:41,142 --> 01:07:42,643
你叫什么名字?
What's your name?

810
01:07:44,812 --> 01:07:46,313
我叫姜戈
Django.

811
01:07:48,733 --> 01:07:50,401
你能拼写吗?
Can you spell it?

812
01:07:52,528 --> 01:07:56,574
是D-J-A-N-G-O
D-J-A-N-G-O.

813
01:07:58,075 --> 01:07:59,577
D不发音
The D is silent.

814
01:07:59,744 --> 01:08:01,328
我知道了
I know.

815
01:08:09,295 --> 01:08:12,798
莫吉先生 你来照看我的新男仆
Mr. Moguy, want you to take care of my new boy here.

816
01:08:12,965 --> 01:08:14,675
给他找个房间 带软床的
You find him a room with a soft bed,

817
01:08:14,842 --> 01:08:17,428
再找个人好好伺候下他
then you bring him up a pony to lick his pole.

818
01:08:17,595 --> 01:08:20,347
但你明早得准备到糖果农场 听清了吗?
But you be ready to travel to Candyland tomorrow morning, now, ya hear?

819
01:08:20,514 --> 01:08:21,515
听到了 先生坎迪
Yessir, Monsieur Candie.

820
01:08:21,682 --> 01:08:25,561
罗斯科 走之前给弗雷德一大瓶啤酒
Before you go, Roscoe, get Fred here a tall beer.

821
01:08:29,398 --> 01:08:32,401
好好享受 是你自己挣来的
You enjoy that, boy. You've earned it.

822
01:08:32,568 --> 01:08:33,861
是的 先生
Yessir.

823
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:47,166
- 黑人 你叫什么?  - 他名叫姜戈·弗里曼
- What's your name, boy?  - His name is Django Freeman.

824
01:08:50,711 --> 01:08:52,338
你从哪儿把他挖来的?
Where'd you dig him up?

825
01:08:52,505 --> 01:08:55,758
一个偶然的机缘让我遇上了姜戈
A fortuitous turn of events brought Django and myself together.

826
01:08:57,468 --> 01:08:59,553
我听说过你
I've heard tell about you.

827
01:09:00,304 --> 01:09:03,057
我听说你四处散布说曼丁哥人不太强
I heard you been telling everybody them Mandingos ain't no damn good.

828
01:09:03,224 --> 01:09:05,351
大家卖的根本不值钱
Ain't nothin' nobody is sellin' is worth buyin'.

829
01:09:05,518 --> 01:09:09,730
我好奇... 什么使你成为曼丁哥专家的?
I'm curious... what makes you such a Mandingo expert?

830
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:14,109
我好奇是什么让你如此好奇
I'm curious what makes you so curious.

831
01:09:17,404 --> 01:09:19,490
- 你说什么 黑鬼?  - 布奇 冷静
- What did you say, boy?  - Calm down, Butch.

832
01:09:20,533 --> 01:09:21,867
他无意...
No offense given...

833
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:23,911
也没有冒犯
none taken.

834
01:09:24,078 --> 01:09:25,788
先生坎迪...
Monsieur Candie...

835
01:09:25,955 --> 01:09:29,458
如果你能直接询问我的话 就再好不过了
I'd appreciate if you could direct your line of inquiry toward me.

836
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:31,085
第一...
One...

837
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:34,839
你还没喝呢 能给你来点提神吗?
you do not have anything to drink. Can I get you a tasty refreshment?

838
01:09:35,005 --> 01:09:37,842
- 好的! 我要啤酒  - 极好的
- Yes! I'll have a beer.  - Wunderbar.

839
01:09:38,008 --> 01:09:39,844
罗斯科 给这位胡子先生一份啤酒
Roscoe, a beer for the man with the beard,

840
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:41,846
我自己来个波利尼西亚珍珠潜水酒
and I will have a Polynesian Pearl Diver.

841
01:09:42,012 --> 01:09:44,098
罗姆酒尽管放
Do not spare the rum.

842
01:09:44,265 --> 01:09:47,768
医生... 我是老练的奴隶贩
Doc... I am a seasoned slaver.

843
01:09:47,935 --> 01:09:49,645
你嘛 还是个新手
You are, well, you are a neophyte.

844
01:09:49,812 --> 01:09:54,942
我只是想确定 这牛仔是否在占你便宜
I'm simply tryin' to ascertain if this cowboy here is takin' advantage of you.

845
01:09:56,402 --> 01:09:59,613
恕我直言 先生坎迪...
With all due respect, Monsieur Candie...

846
01:10:00,322 --> 01:10:02,199
我不是来寻求你的意见的
I didn't seek you out for your advice.

847
01:10:02,366 --> 01:10:04,493
我找你是要买个格斗黑人
I sought you out to purchase a fighting nigger

848
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:07,204
市场上买不到的那种
at above top-dollar market price.

849
01:10:07,371 --> 01:10:09,915
我印象中 当你让我作观众时
Now I was under the impression, when you granted me an audience,

850
01:10:10,082 --> 01:10:12,459
就是要讨论业务了
it would be to discuss business.

851
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:17,631
哎 我们还没讨论生意呢
Well, we weren't talkin' business yet.

852
01:10:17,798 --> 01:10:20,134
我们刚才在讨论我的好奇
We were discussin' my curiosity.

853
01:10:22,428 --> 01:10:23,429
谢谢
Thank you.

854
01:10:23,596 --> 01:10:26,307
罗斯科 可可 去外边玩
Roscoe, Coco, go outside and play.

855
01:10:28,309 --> 01:10:31,770
示巴... 你不用动
Sheba... you stay right there.

856
01:10:31,937 --> 01:10:33,480
我知道你指的不是我
I know you didn't mean me.

857
01:10:35,232 --> 01:10:37,735
- 干杯!  - 敬德国
- Prost!  - German.

858
01:10:38,652 --> 01:10:42,448
根据莫吉说的 如果我和你做生意
Now, according to Moguy, if I do business with you,

859
01:10:42,615 --> 01:10:44,658
就是和你们俩都做生意
I'm doing business with both y'all.

860
01:10:44,825 --> 01:10:47,244
他打量 你掏钱? 是这样的吗?
He does the eyeballin', you the billfold? Is that it?

861
01:10:47,411 --> 01:10:51,165
嗯 别说的那么谄媚 但差不多是的
Well, you don't make it sound too flattering, but more or less, yeah.

862
01:10:51,332 --> 01:10:52,499
嗯
Hm.

863
01:10:53,792 --> 01:10:54,793
那么...
So...

864
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,879
机灵鬼...
Bright Boy...

865
01:10:57,046 --> 01:10:59,006
莫吉说你看过我的非洲货了
Moguy tells me you looked over my African flesh

866
01:10:59,173 --> 01:11:01,342
印象并不太深 是吗?
and you was none too impressed, huh?

867
01:11:01,508 --> 01:11:03,010
不是顶级好货
Not for top dollar.

868
01:11:05,179 --> 01:11:07,222
哦 既然这样 我们也没什么好谈的
Well, then, we got nothin' more to talk about.

869
01:11:07,389 --> 01:11:09,516
看看 你想从我这里买黑人强手
You see, you wanna buy a beat-ass nigger from me,

870
01:11:09,683 --> 01:11:11,936
那些就是我想卖的高手 所以...
those are the beat-ass niggers I wanna sell so...

871
01:11:12,102 --> 01:11:14,063
他不想买你出售的黑人
He don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna sell.

872
01:11:15,022 --> 01:11:18,192
他想买你不想卖的黑人
He wants the nigger you don't wanna sell.

873
01:11:18,359 --> 01:11:22,655
喔 我不出售不想卖的黑鬼
Well, I don't sell the niggers I don't wanna sell.

874
01:11:24,907 --> 01:11:28,577
这个嘛 你不想卖最好的
Well, you won't sell your best.

875
01:11:28,744 --> 01:11:31,163
也不会卖第二好的
You won't even sell your second best.

876
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:35,000
但第三好的...? 你还是不想卖
But your third best...? You don't want to sell him either.

877
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:39,088
但如果我出个惊天报价 你不得不考虑一下...
But if I made you an offer so ridiculous you'd be forced to consider it...

878
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,924
谁知道会发生什么呢?
who knows what could happen?

879
01:11:44,259 --> 01:11:46,553
你觉得什么是惊天报价?
And what do you consider ridiculous?

880
01:11:47,554 --> 01:11:51,642
对一个有真正天赋的货色来说 那个对的人?
For a truly talented specimen, the right nigger?

881
01:11:53,394 --> 01:11:55,437
你觉得该出价多少 姜戈?
How much would you say, Django?

882
01:11:58,816 --> 01:12:00,526
一万二美金
Twelve thousand dollars.

883
01:12:05,072 --> 01:12:09,076
先生们 刚才我只对你们好奇
Well, gentlemen, you had my curiosity,

884
01:12:09,243 --> 01:12:11,161
但现在我注意到你们了
but now you have my attention.

885
01:12:24,842 --> 01:12:30,514
维利 维利 停车! 停车 啊!
Willie. Willie. Hold up! Hold up. Ah!

886
01:12:30,681 --> 01:12:33,100
- 先生们早上好  - 舒尔茨医生早上好
- Good morning, gentlemen.  - Good Dr. Schultz.

887
01:12:33,267 --> 01:12:37,187
- 今天真美啊 不是吗?  - 不能更美了
- Beautiful morning, isn't it?  - You couldn't have picked a better one.

888
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:40,232
请跟我们一起乘维多利亚马车吧
Please, won't you take a ride with us here in the Victoria.

889
01:12:40,399 --> 01:12:41,942
噢 非常感谢
Oh, thank you very much.

890
01:12:42,109 --> 01:12:44,236
你可以把马栓到那边
You can tie your horse up back there.

891
01:12:52,453 --> 01:12:53,746
姜戈
Django.

892
01:12:58,542 --> 01:13:02,171
我与我的骨相学同事们不同的一点就是
Where I part company from many of my phrenologist colleagues

893
01:13:02,337 --> 01:13:07,509
我相信黑鬼能达到超乎聪明 超乎天赋
is I believe there is a level above bright, above talented,

894
01:13:07,676 --> 01:13:11,805
超乎忠诚的水准
above loyal that a nigger can aspire to.

895
01:13:11,972 --> 01:13:16,643
也就是 一个万里挑一的黑鬼
Say, one nigger that just pops up in 10,000.

896
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:18,312
一个杰出的黑人
The exceptional nigger.

897
01:13:19,313 --> 01:13:21,356
天气不错啊 是不是 机灵鬼?
Bright day, huh, Bright Boy?

898
01:13:22,483 --> 01:13:23,650
太阳升起来了
Sun is up.

899
01:13:24,818 --> 01:13:26,695
照耀我们所有人
Shining on all of us.

900
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:34,369
- 医生 请坐  - 谢谢
- Have a seat, doc.  - Thank you.

901
01:13:34,536 --> 01:13:35,829
相当荣幸
Quite an honor.

902
01:13:35,996 --> 01:13:37,706
- 荣幸的是我们  - 谢谢
- The honor is all ours.  - Thank you.

903
01:13:37,873 --> 01:13:41,251
但我坚信 一段时间后
But I do believe that, given time,

904
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:44,379
像机灵鬼这样的杰出黑鬼...
exceptional niggers like Bright Boy here...

905
01:13:45,339 --> 01:13:47,174
会变得不是多...
become if not frequent...

906
01:13:48,425 --> 01:13:50,052
就是更多
more frequent.

907
01:13:51,804 --> 01:13:56,391
机灵鬼 你就是万里挑一
Bright Boy, you are that one in 10,000.

908
01:13:56,558 --> 01:13:59,436
咱们这规矩是跟上 不是赶上 黑鬼
The name of the game is keep up, not catch up, nigger.

909
01:14:12,324 --> 01:14:13,700
哇!
Whoa!

910
01:14:15,202 --> 01:14:18,622
- 碰抢你就死  - 大家都冷静!
- Touch your guns, you die.  - Everybody, calm down!

911
01:14:18,789 --> 01:14:20,707
我目睹了全部过程 没有伤亡
Now I saw the whole thing. No harm done.

912
01:14:20,874 --> 01:14:21,917
你在开玩笑吗?
Are you kidding me?

913
01:14:22,084 --> 01:14:24,086
- 这黑鬼刚刚...  - 我说了没有伤亡!
- This nigger just...  - I said no harm done!

914
01:14:24,253 --> 01:14:26,797
现在把手伸出来 别碰手枪!
Now take your hand off your pistol!

915
01:14:27,881 --> 01:14:30,676
布奇 你也是
Butch, that means you too.

916
01:14:31,885 --> 01:14:34,888
大家别敌对我的客人
Everybody stop antagonizing my guest.

917
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:38,600
胡特! 起来上马
Hoot! Get back up on your horse.

918
01:14:39,351 --> 01:14:40,894
他把我锁骨弄断了!
He broke my collarbone!

919
01:14:41,061 --> 01:14:45,357
看在上帝份上 大家帮胡特上马吧
For God's sake, somebody please help Hoot here back up on his goddamn horse.

920
01:14:45,524 --> 01:14:48,569
- 是的 老板  - 哦 你还真幸运啊 黑鬼
- Yessir, boss.  - Oh, now you are one lucky nigger.

921
01:14:49,945 --> 01:14:51,321
你最好听你老板的 白人
You better listen to your boss, white boy.

922
01:14:51,488 --> 01:14:53,949
哦 我会伴随月光和你漫步
Oh, I'm gonna go walking in the moonlight with you.

923
01:14:54,116 --> 01:14:55,909
你想牵我的手?
You wanna hold my hand?

924
01:15:02,499 --> 01:15:05,169
威利 带我们回家
Willie, take us home.

925
01:15:07,421 --> 01:15:09,423
前进!
Start moving!

926
01:15:15,804 --> 01:15:17,055
把他们带出去!
Head 'em out!

927
01:16:02,684 --> 01:16:04,228
你眼睛有问题吗 小子?
You got a problem with your eyeball, boy?

928
01:16:04,394 --> 01:16:05,646
先生 没有
No, sir.

929
01:16:05,812 --> 01:16:07,314
你想让我踢你眼睛吗?
You want a boot heel in it?

930
01:16:08,523 --> 01:16:09,483
先生 不是
No, sir.

931
01:16:09,650 --> 01:16:12,694
那就别盯着我
Then you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.

932
01:16:12,861 --> 01:16:15,989
你再那样对我翻白眼 我就给你个恨我的理由
You flash that bad look at me again, I'll give you a reason not to like me.

933
01:16:16,156 --> 01:16:17,699
黑鬼 快走!
Now move, nigger!

934
01:16:19,826 --> 01:16:21,954
你们这些黑鬼最好看清形势
You niggers are gonna understand something about me.

935
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,997
我比这里的任何白人都坏
I'm worse than any of these white men here.

936
01:16:24,164 --> 01:16:27,751
不想吃苦头 就别盯着我 
You get the molasses out your ass, you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.

937
01:16:27,918 --> 01:16:30,963
他是粗暴的那类 不是吗?
He is a rambunctious sort, ain't he?

938
01:16:31,129 --> 01:16:32,464
的确
Indeed.

939
01:16:34,967 --> 01:16:38,345
我们能停一会儿吗 我要跟我的人说几句话?
May we stop for a moment so I may put a word in my man's ear?

940
01:16:38,512 --> 01:16:42,224
你知道 我希望对糖果农场的货一见钟情
You know, I'm expecting to fall in love once I see the specimens at Candyland,

941
01:16:42,391 --> 01:16:45,477
在那之前 如果我能跟我朋友
so before that moment, it would be good if I could have

942
01:16:45,644 --> 01:16:50,023
开个机密的战略会议就更好了
a confidential strategy meeting with my confidant.

943
01:16:52,985 --> 01:16:54,820
你要告诉我你在做什么吗?
You mind telling me what the hell you doing?

944
01:16:54,987 --> 01:16:57,030
我确定布隆希达就在糖果农场
I confirmed that Broomhilda's at Candyland.

945
01:17:01,076 --> 01:17:03,662
- 你确定是她?  - 他没叫名字
- You're sure it's her?  - He didn't call her by name,

946
01:17:03,829 --> 01:17:07,207
但她是个年轻女性 背上有鞭痕 会说德语
but she's a young lady, whip marks on her back and speaks German.

947
01:17:07,374 --> 01:17:09,251
虽然这样假设不太明智
Now, while it's not wise to assume,

948
01:17:09,418 --> 01:17:11,878
但这种情况下 我想是很可靠的
in this instance, I think it's pretty safe.

949
01:17:12,045 --> 01:17:16,675
还有一点 别这么急着报复
Point being, don't get so carried away with your retribution.

950
01:17:16,842 --> 01:17:18,802
你忘了我们为何而来
You lose sight of why we're here.

951
01:17:18,969 --> 01:17:20,762
- 你觉得我忘了?  - 是的
- You think I lost sight of that?  - Yes, I do.

952
01:17:20,929 --> 01:17:23,432
别再和坎迪对着干
Stop antagonizing Candie.

953
01:17:23,598 --> 01:17:28,562
小心露馅或者更严重 我们俩都会被杀的
You're going to blow this whole charade, or more than likely get us both killed.

954
01:17:28,729 --> 01:17:33,400
而我 还不想死在美国密西西比州的奇克索郡
And I, for one, don't intend to die in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, USA.

955
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:36,570
我没和他对着干 是想引起他的兴趣
I'm not antagonizing him. I'm intriguing him.

956
01:17:36,737 --> 01:17:39,281
你在冲这些可怜的奴隶们大喊
You're yelling abuse at these poor slaves.

957
01:17:40,282 --> 01:17:45,704
我想起那个当着孩子的面杀死他爸的男人
I recall the man who had me kill another man in front of his son

958
01:17:45,871 --> 01:17:47,664
他可是眼都不眨
and he didn't bat a eye.

959
01:17:49,082 --> 01:17:50,208
记得吗?
You remember that?

960
01:17:52,461 --> 01:17:53,795
当然记得
Yeah, of course I remember.

961
01:17:53,962 --> 01:17:57,424
你当时说 自己的命运自己掌握
What you said was that this is my world,

962
01:17:58,383 --> 01:18:00,385
而要掌握自己的命运 同流合污在所难免
and in my world you gotta get dirty.

963
01:18:01,386 --> 01:18:04,264
我现在就在同流合污
So that's what I'm doing. I'm getting dirty.

964
01:18:07,934 --> 01:18:11,104
和我的原话不完全一样 但...
Well, you're paraphrasing a tad, but...

965
01:18:12,564 --> 01:18:14,649
大意就是这样
that was the general gist.

966
01:18:18,403 --> 01:18:19,905
糖果农场见
See you at Candyland.

967
01:18:27,621 --> 01:18:30,207
好了 黑鬼们 继续走
All right, niggers, back at it.

968
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,543
你也是 月光男
That means you too, Moonlight.

969
01:19:20,924 --> 01:19:23,802
哎呀 是达达尼安!
I'll be. D'Artagnan!

970
01:19:23,969 --> 01:19:27,222
小子 为什么干逃跑这种蠢事?
Now, boy, why do a fool thing like run off?

971
01:19:27,389 --> 01:19:29,474
我没办法再打了 坎迪先生
I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.

972
01:19:29,641 --> 01:19:30,934
你可以的
Yes, you can.

973
01:19:31,101 --> 01:19:34,646
你不一定会赢 但你小子很能打
You might not be able to win, but your ass can fight.

974
01:19:34,813 --> 01:19:37,232
斯通塞弗先生 能不能让这些臭狗闭嘴?
Mr. Stonesipher, would you please shut these goddamn dogs up?

975
01:19:37,399 --> 01:19:40,026
- 我都没办法思考了!  - 闭嘴 玛莎!
- I cannot hear myself think!  - Quiet down, Marsha!

976
01:19:40,193 --> 01:19:42,237
玛莎 别叫了! 玛莎!
Marsha, hush up! Marsha!

977
01:19:42,404 --> 01:19:43,947
别叫了! 喂!
Hush up! Hey!

978
01:19:44,114 --> 01:19:46,741
把这些臭狗从这黑鬼身边拉走!
Get these goddamn dogs away from this nigger!

979
01:19:56,251 --> 01:19:59,713
下来吧 小子... 从树上下来吧
Come on now, boy... get on out that tree.

980
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:01,548
遵命 先生
Yes, sir.

981
01:20:24,112 --> 01:20:26,239
他不见了多久?
How long was he loose?

982
01:20:26,406 --> 01:20:29,659
昨晚 昨天
A night. Day.

983
01:20:29,826 --> 01:20:31,453
前天半夜
Half the other night.

984
01:20:32,579 --> 01:20:34,122
他逃了多远?
How far he get off the property?

985
01:20:34,289 --> 01:20:35,999
出了庄园大概20英里
About 20 miles off the prop.

986
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:38,293
对于一个瘸子来说 算是逃得很远了
Pretty far considering that limp he got.

987
01:20:41,087 --> 01:20:44,424
莫吉先生 达达尼安这周五会和谁打?
Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan supposed to fight on Friday?

988
01:20:44,591 --> 01:20:46,218
一个新人
One of this new lot.

989
01:20:47,385 --> 01:20:50,096
看他这副死人样 瞎子也不会赌他赢
Well, way he looks now, a blind Indian wouldn't bet a bead on him.

990
01:20:50,263 --> 01:20:52,766
求您了 坎迪先生 我已经没办法再打了
Please, Monsieur Candie, I ain't got it in me no more.

991
01:20:52,933 --> 01:20:54,434
- 别 别 别  - 我不行了...
- Now, now, now, now, now.  - I can't...

992
01:20:54,601 --> 01:20:57,020
别求我
Now, no begging.

993
01:20:57,187 --> 01:20:59,648
别利用我的同情心
No playing on my soft heart.

994
01:21:03,109 --> 01:21:05,654
- 你有麻烦了 小子  - 知道 先生
- You in trouble now, son.  - Yes, sir.

995
01:21:08,573 --> 01:21:12,118
我花500块买了你
I done paid $500 for you.

996
01:21:12,285 --> 01:21:17,165
这500块是要你在被别人打死之前
When I pay $500, then I expect to get five fights out of a nigger

997
01:21:17,332 --> 01:21:19,709
- 打够5场比赛  - 先生
- before he roll over and play dead.  - Sir.

998
01:21:19,876 --> 01:21:23,755
你得明白 我是个生意人
You got to understand that I'm running a business here.

999
01:21:23,922 --> 01:21:26,633
- 你只打了三场  - 但三场我都赢了
- You fought three fights.  - But I won every one.

1000
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,301
没错 没错
Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

1001
01:21:28,468 --> 01:21:31,471
但最后那场 你差点就输了
But that last one, you muddled the line between winning and losing.

1002
01:21:31,638 --> 01:21:32,681
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

1003
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:37,394
板上钉钉的事实是
Still, the fact remains:

1004
01:21:37,561 --> 01:21:41,189
我花了500块 你他妈就得给我打够5场!
I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights!

1005
01:21:41,356 --> 01:21:43,900
我那500块怎么办?
So what about my $500, huh?

1006
01:21:45,777 --> 01:21:47,696
我那500块怎么办?
What about my $500?

1007
01:21:49,239 --> 01:21:50,782
你来补偿给我?
You gonna reimburse me?

1008
01:21:56,788 --> 01:21:59,165
你连"补偿"是什么意思都不知道吧?
You even know what "reimburse" means?

1009
01:22:07,674 --> 01:22:09,384
我来补偿你!
I'll reimburse you!

1010
01:22:13,138 --> 01:22:14,347
真的?
You will?

1011
01:22:15,557 --> 01:22:17,100
真的
Yep.

1012
01:22:19,853 --> 01:22:22,564
你要花500块
You'll pay $500

1013
01:22:22,731 --> 01:22:26,192
去买一个扫地都不会的独眼龙?
for practically a one-eyed old Joe ain't fit to push a broom?

1014
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:27,485
他不会买的
No, he won't.

1015
01:22:29,738 --> 01:22:31,823
他只是不想再看你耍他了
He just tired of you toying with him is all.

1016
01:22:32,741 --> 01:22:34,701
事实上 我也不想再看了
Matter of fact, so am I.

1017
01:22:34,868 --> 01:22:37,329
但我们不会花一分钱去买这个黑小子
But we ain't paying a penny for that pickaninny.

1018
01:22:37,495 --> 01:22:39,289
买了也没用 对吧 医生?
Ain't got no use for him. Ain't that right, doc?

1019
01:22:41,041 --> 01:22:42,250
你听到了吧
You heard him.

1020
01:22:51,426 --> 01:22:55,180
请原谅斯通塞弗先生的惊讶表情
You're gonna have to excuse Mr.Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.

1021
01:22:55,347 --> 01:22:59,017
他这辈子都没见过像你这样的黑人
He ain't never seen a nigger like you ever in his life.

1022
01:22:59,809 --> 01:23:01,770
没错吧 斯通塞弗先生
Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?

1023
01:23:04,022 --> 01:23:05,482
没错
That right.

1024
01:23:06,483 --> 01:23:07,817
说实话
For that matter,

1025
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:10,695
我也没见过
nor have I.

1026
01:23:16,785 --> 01:23:17,952
既然...
Now...

1027
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:22,248
你们不肯花钱买下这个黑小子
seeing as you won't pay a penny for this pickaninny here,

1028
01:23:24,751 --> 01:23:28,088
那你们不介意我用自己的手段处置这个黑鬼吧?
you won't mind me handling this nigger any way I see fit?

1029
01:23:29,214 --> 01:23:30,757
他是你的人
He's your nigger.

1030
01:23:34,511 --> 01:23:36,596
斯通塞弗先生?
Mr. Stonesipher?

1031
01:23:37,389 --> 01:23:41,351
让玛莎和它的伙伴 送达达尼安去黑鬼天堂吧
Let Marsha and her bitches send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.

1032
01:23:41,518 --> 01:23:46,314
玛莎! 玛莎 去咬他!
Marsha! Marsha, hey, get him!

1033
01:23:47,774 --> 01:23:49,984
咬他! 咬他!
Get him, get him!

1034
01:24:23,476 --> 01:24:25,520
你的老板好像不太喜欢
Your boss looks a little green around the gills

1035
01:24:25,687 --> 01:24:27,856
黑鬼搏击这种血腥的运动
for a blood sport like nigger fighting.

1036
01:24:28,022 --> 01:24:32,652
不 他只是没见过一个被狗撕成碎片的人
Nah, he just ain't used to seeing a man ripped apart by dogs is all.

1037
01:24:35,613 --> 01:24:36,990
但你经常见到?
You are used to it?

1038
01:24:37,157 --> 01:24:40,118
我只是对美国人的所做所为习以为常
I'm just a little more used to Americans than he is.

1039
01:24:40,285 --> 01:24:44,998
先生坎迪...
Now, Monsieur Candie...

1040
01:24:45,165 --> 01:24:46,791
我们随时可以继续走
whenever you're ready.

1041
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:50,336
我们骑了五个小时马 就为了看看你的私人珍藏
We rode five hours so you could show off your stock.

1042
01:24:50,503 --> 01:24:52,130
别让我们失望
Let's get to it.

1043
01:24:53,339 --> 01:24:57,719
如果你的人是这副模样 我可不太满意
Cause as of now, if he's an example, I ain't impressed.

1044
01:24:59,929 --> 01:25:01,347
跟我来
Follow me.

1045
01:25:57,929 --> 01:26:01,347
密西西比银行

1046
01:26:05,929 --> 01:26:07,347
卡尔文·坎迪

1047
01:26:58,631 --> 01:27:01,342
让他们在左边排好队
Line them up to the left here now, boy.

1048
01:27:02,969 --> 01:27:04,345
抬头挺胸!
Stand up straight, now!

1049
01:27:05,513 --> 01:27:06,806
过去
Get up there.

1050
01:27:06,973 --> 01:27:09,559
过去 快点
Get up there, boy. Come on.

1051
01:27:09,726 --> 01:27:11,352
排好队! 排好队!
Give me a line! Give me a line!

1052
01:27:11,519 --> 01:27:13,605
排好队! 站直了!
Get in line there! Straighten up!

1053
01:28:13,247 --> 01:28:14,874
你好! 我的史蒂芬!
Hello! Stephen, my boy!

1054
01:28:15,041 --> 01:28:17,710
好好好 你好 臭小子
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hello, my ass.

1055
01:28:17,877 --> 01:28:20,838
那个骑着马的黑鬼是谁?
Who this nigger up on that nag?

1056
01:28:21,005 --> 01:28:24,342
史蒂芬 你早饭吃了炸药吗? 怎么这么暴躁?
Stephen, you have nails for breakfast? What's the matter? Why you so ornery?

1057
01:28:24,509 --> 01:28:26,886
- 你惦记着我吗?  - 我可惦记你了 先生
- You miss me, huh?  - Oh, yes, sir.

1058
01:28:27,053 --> 01:28:30,598
就像猪惦记泔水一样!
I miss you like a hog miss slop!

1059
01:28:30,765 --> 01:28:34,686
就像婴儿惦记妈妈的乳头一样
Like a baby miss mammy's titty.

1060
01:28:34,852 --> 01:28:38,690
我像惦记鞋里的石子那样惦记着你
I miss you like I misses a rock in my shoe.

1061
01:28:41,109 --> 01:28:45,571
我得问你 那个骑着马的黑鬼是谁?
Now, I axed you: Who this nigger on that nag?

1062
01:28:45,738 --> 01:28:47,407
喂 雪球
Hey, Snowball.

1063
01:28:48,616 --> 01:28:52,203
想知道我或者我的马的名字 问我就行
Wanna know my name or the name of my horse, you ask me.

1064
01:28:52,370 --> 01:28:55,206
你叫谁"雪球"呢 小子?
Just who the hell you calling "Snowball," horse boy?

1065
01:28:55,373 --> 01:28:57,041
我要把你这黑鬼从马上拖下来
I'll snatch your black ass off that nag there

1066
01:28:57,208 --> 01:28:58,584
扔到泥地里 我的动作能快到...
and in the mud so fast...

1067
01:28:58,751 --> 01:29:00,837
- 让你晕头转向  - 史蒂芬 史蒂芬 史蒂芬
- make your head spin.  - Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.

1068
01:29:01,004 --> 01:29:05,299
别激动 姜戈是自由身
Let's keep it funny. Django here's a free man.

1069
01:29:05,466 --> 01:29:07,844
- 这个黑鬼?  - 那个黑鬼
- This nigger here?  - That nigger there.

1070
01:29:08,011 --> 01:29:10,263
我来介绍你们认识
Let me at least introduce the two of you.

1071
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:14,225
姜戈 这是一个和你一样不要脸的黑鬼 史蒂芬
Django, this is another cheeky black bugger like yourself, Stephen.

1072
01:29:14,392 --> 01:29:17,645
史蒂芬 这位是姜戈 你们之间肯定有仇
Stephen, this here's Django. You two oughta hate each other.

1073
01:29:17,812 --> 01:29:21,816
卡尔文 你还怕这黑鬼不高兴? 他是何方神圣?
Calvin, just who the hell is this nigger you feels the need to entertain?

1074
01:29:21,983 --> 01:29:25,903
姜戈和这位穿灰西装的舒尔茨医生 是我的顾客
Django and his friend in gray here, Dr. Schultz, are customers.

1075
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:27,447
是我们的客人 史蒂芬
And they are our guests, Stephen.

1076
01:29:27,613 --> 01:29:31,117
你这个老东西得对他们客气点
And you, you old decrepit bastard, oughta show them every hospitality.

1077
01:29:31,284 --> 01:29:33,661
- 知道吗?  - 知道 先生 那个白人我能理解
- You understand that?  - Yes, sir. Him I understand.

1078
01:29:33,828 --> 01:29:35,496
但我不明白为什么要对这个黑鬼客气
But I don't know why I got to take lip off this nigger.

1079
01:29:35,663 --> 01:29:38,291
你不需要明白 懂我的意思?
You don't have to know why. Do you understand?

1080
01:29:39,292 --> 01:29:40,793
是的 先生 懂了
Yes, sir. I understand.

1081
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:43,421
很好 他们会在这里过夜
Well, good. They're spending the night.

1082
01:29:43,588 --> 01:29:45,715
去楼上准备好两间客房
Go up in the guest bedrooms and get two ready.

1083
01:29:46,883 --> 01:29:48,551
他要住在大宅里?
He gonna stay in The Big House?

1084
01:29:48,718 --> 01:29:50,928
史蒂芬 他是个奴隶商人 和其他黑鬼不一样
Stephen, he's a slaver. It's different.

1085
01:29:51,095 --> 01:29:53,681
- 住大宅里?  - 你有意见吗?
- In The Big House?  - Well, you got a problem with that?

1086
01:29:53,848 --> 01:29:56,142
不 我没意见
Oh, no. I ain't got no problem with it,

1087
01:29:56,309 --> 01:29:58,352
如果你不介意烧掉这黑鬼用过的
if you ain't got no problem with burning the bed, the sheets,

1088
01:29:58,519 --> 01:30:00,855
床 被单 枕头套之类的东西!
the pillowcases, everything else when this black-ass motherfucker's gone!

1089
01:30:01,022 --> 01:30:03,274
这是我来操心的问题! 烧不烧由我! 
That is my problem! They are mine to burn!

1090
01:30:03,441 --> 01:30:05,651
而你现在的问题是 你没给客人留下好印象!
Now your problem right now is making a good impression!

1091
01:30:05,818 --> 01:30:07,737
我命令你立刻解决这个问题
And I want you to start solving that problem right now

1092
01:30:07,904 --> 01:30:09,530
并把房间准备好!
and get them goddamn rooms ready!

1093
01:30:11,657 --> 01:30:13,576
遵命 坎迪先生
Yes, sir, Monsieur Candie.

1094
01:30:15,036 --> 01:30:16,204
快去
Go on, now.

1095
01:30:17,121 --> 01:30:19,540
居然让一个黑鬼住在大宅里 不可思议
Can't believe you brought a nigger to stay in The Big House.

1096
01:30:19,707 --> 01:30:21,042
你爸肯定会气得从坟墓里跳出来
Your daddy rolling over in his goddamned grave.

1097
01:30:21,209 --> 01:30:24,754
瞧他那张破嘴 越来越离谱了
Man, the lip on him. Whoo! He's getting worse and worse.

1098
01:30:24,921 --> 01:30:26,089
好了...
Now...

1099
01:30:26,255 --> 01:30:30,927
我美若天仙的妹妹在哪里?!
Where is my beautiful sister?!

1100
01:30:31,094 --> 01:30:34,180
在那里!
There she is!

1101
01:30:34,347 --> 01:30:39,393
舒尔茨医生 这位来自南方的绝色美人是舍妹 她是寡妇
Dr. Schultz, this attractive Southern belle is my widowed sister.

1102
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:43,564
亲爱的 你真是秀色可餐
Darling, you are a tonic for tired eyes.

1103
01:30:44,816 --> 01:30:48,194
请允许我向你们介绍 劳拉·李·坎迪·斐茨威利
May I present to you Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.

1104
01:30:48,361 --> 01:30:51,739
切斯特 罗德尼 小鸡查理 你们给我滚到鸡圈去
Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charly. Y'all get your ass over by that pen.

1105
01:30:51,906 --> 01:30:54,033
- 快 查理 快点!  - 快走
- Come on, Charly. Come on, now!  - Let's go.

1106
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:55,243
你们知道鸡圈在哪里
You know where it is.

1107
01:30:55,409 --> 01:30:57,161
跑快点!
Like you on a rope!

1108
01:30:58,371 --> 01:31:01,124
黑鬼不许走路 只许跑步!
Niggers don't walk around here, niggers run!

1109
01:31:01,833 --> 01:31:04,836
先生坎迪?
Monsieur Candie?

1110
01:31:05,002 --> 01:31:08,798
话说你刚才提到了一个黑妞?
Yeah. About that matter about the nigger girl you were talking about?

1111
01:31:08,965 --> 01:31:09,924
黑妞?
Nigger gal?

1112
01:31:10,091 --> 01:31:13,094
是的 我记得你说她会说德语
Yeah, I believe you mentioned she spoke German.

1113
01:31:13,261 --> 01:31:15,847
是的! 希尔迪 你对她有兴趣?
Ah, yes! Hildi, what about her?

1114
01:31:16,013 --> 01:31:20,184
在参观你的奴隶之前 能先把她送到我的房间吗?
Do you think before the demonstration, you could send her around to my room?

1115
01:31:20,351 --> 01:31:24,522
你这个老滑头 举手之劳
You little dickens, you. I don't see why not.

1116
01:31:24,689 --> 01:31:28,067
史蒂芬 你安顿好他们后 叫希尔迪过来
Stephen, when you get through showing them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi,

1117
01:31:28,234 --> 01:31:30,069
把她打扮得漂漂亮亮的
get her cleaned up and smelling real nice,

1118
01:31:30,236 --> 01:31:31,654
然后送到舒尔茨医生的房间
and sent over to Dr. Schultz's room here.

1119
01:31:31,821 --> 01:31:33,489
事实上 坎迪先生
Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir,

1120
01:31:33,656 --> 01:31:36,325
有件事我还没告诉你
there's something I ain't told you about yet.

1121
01:31:36,534 --> 01:31:40,204
- 什么事?  - 希尔迪在热箱里
- What?  - Uh, Hildi in the hot box.

1122
01:31:41,706 --> 01:31:42,874
她为什么会在那里?
What's she doing there?

1123
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:45,793
你说被关在热箱是为什么?
What you think she doing there in the hot box?

1124
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,420
她在受罚
She's being punished.

1125
01:31:47,587 --> 01:31:49,922
- 她犯了什么事?  - 她又逃跑了
- What she do?  - She run off again.

1126
01:31:50,089 --> 01:31:52,758
天啊 史蒂芬 我不在家的时候跑了几个人?
Jesus Christ, Stephen, how many people ran away while I was gone?

1127
01:31:52,925 --> 01:31:55,428
- 两个  - 她什么时候逃跑的?
- Two.  - When did she go?

1128
01:31:55,595 --> 01:31:58,097
昨晚 今天早上被抓回来了
Last night. They brung her back this morning.

1129
01:31:58,264 --> 01:32:00,933
她没被斯通塞弗的狗撕成碎片吧?
How bad did Stonesipher's dogs tear her up?

1130
01:32:01,851 --> 01:32:05,354
她很走运 那些狗当时在追达达尼安
Lucky for her, they was out chasing D'Artagnan's ass.

1131
01:32:05,521 --> 01:32:09,817
是比利和科迪找到她并抓她回来的
Bill and Cody went looking for her, found her, brung her back.

1132
01:32:09,984 --> 01:32:12,904
她受了点伤 但都是她穿过灌木丛的时候
Now, she a little beat-up. But she done that to her own damn self

1133
01:32:13,070 --> 01:32:14,280
自己弄伤的
running through them damn bushes and shit.

1134
01:32:14,447 --> 01:32:16,115
她被关多久了?
How long she been in the box?

1135
01:32:16,282 --> 01:32:19,076
还能关多久? 一整天
How long you think she been in there? All damn day.

1136
01:32:19,243 --> 01:32:21,913
还得再关十天
And the little bitch got ten more days to be in there.

1137
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:25,124
- 算了 放她出来吧  - 放她出来? 为什么?
- Still, take her out.  - Take her out? Why?

1138
01:32:25,291 --> 01:32:29,212
因为我说要放她出来 舒尔茨医生是我的客人
Because I said so, that's why. Dr. Schultz is my guest.

1139
01:32:29,378 --> 01:32:30,338
希尔迪是我的奴隶
Hildi is my nigger.

1140
01:32:30,504 --> 01:32:33,674
我们南方人对客人有求必应
Southern hospitality dictates I make her available to him.

1141
01:32:33,841 --> 01:32:37,053
- 可是 坎迪先生 她逃跑了  - 天啊 史蒂芬
- But, Monsieur Candie, she run off.  - Jesus Christ, Stephen.

1142
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:39,639
会德语的黑鬼就是用来服侍德国客人的
What is the point of having a nigger that speaks German

1143
01:32:39,805 --> 01:32:42,266
如果这都做不到 那要他们有何用?
if you can't wheel them out when you have a German guest?

1144
01:32:42,433 --> 01:32:46,604
我知道这不太方便 但你还是放这小妞出来吧
Now, I realize it is inconvenient, but still, you take her ass out.

1145
01:32:46,771 --> 01:32:47,939
遵命 先生
Yes, sir.

1146
01:32:49,232 --> 01:32:51,817
劳拉·李! 你和科拉负责
Lara Lee! Will you and Cora be responsible

1147
01:32:51,984 --> 01:32:55,363
帮希尔迪梳妆打扮吧
for getting Hildi cleaned up and presentable for Dr. Schultz here.

1148
01:32:55,529 --> 01:32:56,906
没问题 亲爱的
Of course, darling.

1149
01:32:57,073 --> 01:33:01,953
先生们 很抱歉 走了这么长的路 鄙人已经很累了
Now, gentlemen, I do apologize, but I am weary from our travels beyond words.

1150
01:33:02,119 --> 01:33:04,997
请允许我稍作休息
It is time for me to rest my tired eyes.

1151
01:33:09,835 --> 01:33:12,588
听到主人说的话没有! 把这贱人放出来!
Y'all done heard the man! Get her ass up outta there!

1152
01:33:12,755 --> 01:33:15,299
科拉! 过来!
Cora! Come here!

1153
01:33:15,466 --> 01:33:18,511
带她去那边梳妆打扮 然后把她带回来给这位...
Get over there and get her cleaned up, bring her back over here to Dr...

1154
01:33:18,678 --> 01:33:21,055
- 你叫什么来着? 舒茨?  - 舒尔茨
- What he say your name is? Shoots?  - Schultz.

1155
01:33:21,222 --> 01:33:23,683
舒尔茨医生 把她带过来 快点
Schultz. Get her back over here. Hurry up, girl.

1156
01:33:23,849 --> 01:33:27,228
遵命
Yes, sir.

1157
01:34:10,813 --> 01:34:13,524
小妞 站起来
Come on, girl. Stand up.

1158
01:34:43,554 --> 01:34:47,099
你是想跟我来还是想住那个小盒子?
Is you coming with me or is you gonna sleep in that little box over yonder?

1159
01:36:22,278 --> 01:36:23,737
你们好
Hello, ladies.

1160
01:36:23,904 --> 01:36:27,283
舒尔茨医生 请允许我向您介绍布隆希达
Dr. Schultz. May I introduce to you Broomhilda?

1161
01:36:31,454 --> 01:36:33,914
希尔迪 这位是舒尔茨医生
Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.

1162
01:36:35,374 --> 01:36:37,501
很高兴认识你 布隆希达
It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.

1163
01:36:38,544 --> 01:36:40,880
你的主人对你赞不绝口
I've heard a lot of good things about you.

1164
01:36:41,046 --> 01:36:43,841
您也知道 不是每个黑鬼都会说德语的
Well, it's not every nigger speaks German, don't ya know.

1165
01:36:47,094 --> 01:36:49,096
看着你 布隆希达
As I look at you now, Broomhilda,

1166
01:36:49,263 --> 01:36:54,226
我感受得到 所有因你而生的激情都是完全合理的
I can see all the passions you inspire are completely justified.

1167
01:36:57,563 --> 01:36:59,899
这位医生是德国人
The doctor here speaks German.

1168
01:37:01,901 --> 01:37:03,861
听说你也会讲德语?
And I've been informed you do as well?

1169
01:37:05,404 --> 01:37:07,573
来吧 说两句德语来听听
Go ahead, girl. Speak a little German.

1170
01:37:09,821 --> 01:37:13,448
很荣幸能用德语与您交谈

1171
01:37:15,915 --> 01:37:17,917
棒极了
Astonishing.

1172
01:37:18,915 --> 01:37:19,917
请进吧 小姑娘

1173
01:37:24,882 --> 01:37:27,092
- 我再给您拿点...  - 非常感谢
- And I shall bring you...  - Much obliged.

1174
01:37:33,302 --> 01:37:35,728
我给你倒杯水好吗?

1175
01:37:36,602 --> 01:37:37,728
好的
Ja.

1176
01:38:01,126 --> 01:38:02,586
别害怕
Don't be afraid.

1177
01:38:05,666 --> 01:38:07,168
失陪一下

1178
01:38:13,666 --> 01:38:18,168
我知道你很久没说德语了

1179
01:38:22,666 --> 01:38:25,168
所以我会说慢点

1180
01:38:30,666 --> 01:38:35,168
我跟你说德语只是为了不让坎迪的人偷听到我们的谈话

1181
01:38:40,666 --> 01:38:43,168
抱歉
Hm. Pardon.

1182
01:38:46,666 --> 01:38:48,168
你真漂亮

1183
01:38:50,759 --> 01:38:52,052
谢谢夸奖
Danke.

1184
01:39:01,166 --> 01:39:05,168
我有位朋友 他也是你朋友

1185
01:39:06,666 --> 01:39:09,168
我们大费周章

1186
01:39:09,666 --> 01:39:12,168
千里迢迢

1187
01:39:12,666 --> 01:39:15,168
来找你 小姑娘

1188
01:39:17,666 --> 01:39:19,168
来救你

1189
01:39:20,966 --> 01:39:22,468
喝吧

1190
01:39:26,666 --> 01:39:30,168
我和他打算

1191
01:39:30,666 --> 01:39:33,168
救你离开这个虎穴

1192
01:39:33,666 --> 01:39:35,168
我没有朋友

1193
01:39:37,366 --> 01:39:40,168
你有

1194
01:39:40,666 --> 01:39:41,468
谁?

1195
01:39:41,966 --> 01:39:44,468
我不能告诉你

1196
01:39:46,966 --> 01:39:51,468
我们的朋友很有演员天赋

1197
01:39:53,166 --> 01:39:55,468
这位朋友在哪里?

1198
01:39:58,166 --> 01:40:00,168
就在那扇门后站着

1199
01:40:07,791 --> 01:40:10,376
你得保证不会尖叫?

1200
01:40:14,791 --> 01:40:18,376
向我保证

1201
01:40:20,491 --> 01:40:22,076
我保证

1202
01:40:37,491 --> 01:40:39,076
好啊 小鬼头
Hey, little trouble maker.

1203
01:40:47,668 --> 01:40:50,963
你小子口才不错啊
You silver-tongued devil, you.

1204
01:40:52,548 --> 01:40:53,882
- 你们快点  - 这些已经准备好了 科拉小姐
- Hurry up, girl.  - These ready, Miss Cora.

1205
01:40:54,049 --> 01:40:55,300
不不不 他们晚上要喝酒
No, no, no, they drinking tonight.

1206
01:40:55,467 --> 01:40:58,429
到楼下去 把坎迪先生喜欢喝的那罐红酒拿上来 听到了吗?
Go downstairs, get the big jug with the red stuff Monsieur Candie like, hear?

1207
01:40:58,595 --> 01:41:01,348
- 你那漂亮的大屁股挡着我的道了  - 别说你不喜欢我的大屁股
- Get your big pretty ass out the way.  - You know you like it.

1208
01:41:01,515 --> 01:41:03,726
那是因为你知道我喜欢什么
That's cause you knows what I like.

1209
01:41:03,892 --> 01:41:06,478
快点继续做饼干
Ooh! Come on with these biscuits, girl.

1210
01:41:06,645 --> 01:41:12,443
先生坎迪 毋庸置疑 他们都是好货色
Look, Monsieur Candie, they were all fine specimens, no doubt about it.

1211
01:41:12,609 --> 01:41:16,989
但很明显 最好的三个是山姆森...
But the best three by far were Samson...

1212
01:41:18,365 --> 01:41:19,950
- 还有一个叫什么?  - 高迪
- What's that other one's name?  - Goldie.

1213
01:41:20,117 --> 01:41:23,454
高迪 还有爱斯基摩·乔
Goldie. And Eskimo Joe.

1214
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:26,206
顺便问一句 他为什么叫爱斯基摩·乔?
By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?

1215
01:41:26,373 --> 01:41:29,460
天知道那些黑鬼的绰号是怎么来的
You never know how these nigger nicknames get started.

1216
01:41:29,626 --> 01:41:32,212
他本名叫乔 也许他总是觉得冷吧?
His name was Joe, maybe one day he said he was cold. Who knows?

1217
01:41:35,883 --> 01:41:41,221
无论如何 山姆森是最好的那个 我们都知道
Well, regardless, Samson's your best. We all know that.

1218
01:41:41,388 --> 01:41:45,100
你肯定不卖他 我也知道为什么 因为他是顶级的
You will never sell him, and I can see why. He's a champion.

1219
01:41:45,267 --> 01:41:49,021
不 他们三个都是顶级的
Hm-hm. All three are champions.

1220
01:41:49,688 --> 01:41:51,774
只有山姆森是顶级的
Samson's the champion.

1221
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:53,734
其他两个只是很出色而已
Them other two pretty good.

1222
01:41:55,027 --> 01:41:56,528
卡尔文 这个黑鬼竟敢顶嘴...
Calvin, now what's this nigger you let...

1223
01:41:56,695 --> 01:41:57,821
没事
It's all right.

1224
01:41:57,988 --> 01:42:00,073
有件事你得明白 先生坎迪
You have to understand, Monsieur Candie,

1225
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:03,619
我承认 关于黑鬼搏击游戏我还是新手
while admittedly a neophyte in the nigger fight game,

1226
01:42:03,786 --> 01:42:08,081
但我之前在欧洲巡演马戏团待过一阵子
I do have a little bit of a background in the European traveling circus.

1227
01:42:08,248 --> 01:42:09,333
是吗?
Is that right?

1228
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:13,587
所以说 只要涉及到表演 我就有发言权
Hence, I have big ideas when it comes to presentation.

1229
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:17,341
我要的不止是一个大块头
I need something more than just a big nigger.

1230
01:42:19,092 --> 01:42:21,303
他还得有架势
Yeah, he needs to have panache.

1231
01:42:21,470 --> 01:42:24,556
- 得有什么?  - 架势 是...
- Need to have what? What?  - Panache. Uh...

1232
01:42:24,723 --> 01:42:27,476
- 知道怎么表现自己  - 表现力 对
- A sense of Showmanship.  - Showmanship, yes.

1233
01:42:27,643 --> 01:42:30,854
我要把他称为黑人大力神
I want to be able to bill him as The Black Hercules.

1234
01:42:32,815 --> 01:42:34,191
黑人大力神 这都被你想到了?
The Black Hercules, isn't that clever?

1235
01:42:34,358 --> 01:42:35,359
黑鬼大力神还差不多
More like Nigger-les.

1236
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:43,200
我说过 "我愿意花最高价
I said, and I quote: "I would pay top dollar for

1237
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:46,495
买'合适的黑鬼'"
'the right nigger'."

1238
01:42:46,662 --> 01:42:50,958
我意思不是说爱斯基摩·乔不合适
Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger, per se.

1239
01:42:51,124 --> 01:42:53,836
但他真的无可挑剔吗?
But is he right as rain?

1240
01:42:55,087 --> 01:42:56,505
舒尔茨医生
Oh, Dr. Schultz,

1241
01:42:56,672 --> 01:43:00,467
你得知道 在黑鬼搏击游戏中
I will have you know there is no one in the nigger fight game

1242
01:43:00,634 --> 01:43:02,553
最看重表现力的人
that appreciates the value of showmanship

1243
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:04,471
非鄙人卡尔文·坎迪莫属
more than Monsieur Calvin J. Candie here.

1244
01:43:04,638 --> 01:43:05,639
非我主人莫属
Nobody.

1245
01:43:05,806 --> 01:43:07,641
但我们不能忘了黑鬼搏击游戏中
But one must not forget the most important thing

1246
01:43:07,808 --> 01:43:09,184
最重要的一点
in the nigger fight game.

1247
01:43:09,351 --> 01:43:11,353
他必须能打赢比赛
And that is a nigger that can win fights.

1248
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:17,109
你首要考虑的是赢 接着考虑的还是赢 赢赢赢
Now that should be your first, second, third, fourth, and fifth concern.

1249
01:43:17,276 --> 01:43:19,319
你要先确定他能打赢
Now, after you have that, and you know you have that,

1250
01:43:19,486 --> 01:43:23,448
再去加这些噱头
then you can start to implement a grand design.

1251
01:43:23,615 --> 01:43:26,159
换句话说 打赢才是硬道理
In other words, first thing is first.

1252
01:43:26,326 --> 01:43:27,786
打赢才是硬道理
First thing's first.

1253
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:38,839
你们很合得来嘛
Ooh! I see you two getting on.

1254
01:43:39,006 --> 01:43:40,883
非常合得来
Famously.

1255
01:43:41,633 --> 01:43:44,303
坎迪先生 我已经四年没听到过母语了
Oh, Monsieur Candie, you can't imagine what it's like

1256
01:43:44,469 --> 01:43:47,806
你无法想像这有多么难受
not to hear your native tongue in four years.

1257
01:43:47,973 --> 01:43:49,808
在波士顿(美国北方城市)待两个星期我都受不了
Well, hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.

1258
01:43:52,227 --> 01:43:54,271
在波士顿待两个星期!
Two weeks in Boston!

1259
01:43:54,438 --> 01:43:57,232
坎迪先生 你真幽默!
Monsieur Candie, you a mess!

1260
01:43:57,399 --> 01:43:59,109
在波士顿待两个星期!
Two weeks in Boston!

1261
01:43:59,276 --> 01:44:04,489
能用母语交谈真开心
I can't express the joy I felt conversing in my mother tongue.

1262
01:44:04,656 --> 01:44:08,744
希尔迪又是个口齿伶俐的姑娘
And Hildi is a charming conversation companion.

1263
01:44:08,911 --> 01:44:10,787
当心点 舒尔茨医生
Well, be careful now, Dr. Schultz.

1264
01:44:10,954 --> 01:44:13,707
当心自己爱上一个黑妞了
You might-a caught yourself a little dose of nigger love.

1265
01:44:13,874 --> 01:44:15,959
这种感情可是相当厉害
Nigger love's a powerful emotion, boy.

1266
01:44:16,126 --> 01:44:18,128
就像一池子黑焦油
It's like a pool of black tar.

1267
01:44:18,295 --> 01:44:19,922
陷进去就出不来了
Once it catches your ass, you're caught.

1268
01:44:20,088 --> 01:44:23,050
没错 先生 无法自拔
Yes, sir, you stuck.

1269
01:44:23,216 --> 01:44:24,760
不知道呢 医生
I don't know, doctor.

1270
01:44:24,927 --> 01:44:27,179
你可以用德语对她说各种各样的甜言蜜语
You can lay on all the German sweet talk you want,

1271
01:44:27,346 --> 01:44:31,850
但这小妞貌似对姜戈很有兴趣
but it looks like this pony's got big eyes for Django.

1272
01:44:34,269 --> 01:44:36,730
这是本能反应
Well, naturally.

1273
01:44:36,897 --> 01:44:40,525
能吸引她注意力的只有飞翔的雄鹰
It is the soaring eagle that attracts her attention,

1274
01:44:40,692 --> 01:44:43,487
而不是被拔光毛的鸡
not the plucked chicken.

1275
01:44:43,654 --> 01:44:46,156
舒尔茨医生 不需如此自贬
Dr. Schultz, don't be so down on yourself.

1276
01:44:46,323 --> 01:44:48,241
你可是一名有为的欧洲绅士
You are quite the dapper European gentleman.

1277
01:44:48,408 --> 01:44:49,451
要把盘子洗干净
You got to clean these dishes,

1278
01:44:49,618 --> 01:44:51,620
就得用胳膊肘去洗 听见了吗?
you got to put your elbow in these dishes, you hear me?

1279
01:44:51,787 --> 01:44:53,997
你认识那个黑鬼吧?
You know that nigger, don't you?

1280
01:44:54,915 --> 01:44:56,208
- 哪个?  - "哪个?"
- Who?  - "Who?"

1281
01:44:56,375 --> 01:44:59,461
别跟我装傻 小贱人 你知道我说的是哪个
Don't "who" me, bitch. You know who I'm talking about.

1282
01:45:01,213 --> 01:45:03,215
坐在餐桌上那个?
At the table?

1283
01:45:03,382 --> 01:45:04,633
我不认识他
I don't know him.

1284
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:07,844
- 你不认识他  - 不认识
- You don't know him.  - No.

1285
01:45:08,011 --> 01:45:10,847
- 礼貌点  - 不认识 先生
- "No," what?  - No, sir.

1286
01:45:15,477 --> 01:45:17,938
你不会跟我撒谎吧?
You wouldn't lie to me, now, would you?

1287
01:45:22,150 --> 01:45:23,360
好
OK.

1288
01:45:24,611 --> 01:45:27,739
这是你说的
Yeah. If you say so.

1289
01:45:34,204 --> 01:45:37,624
毋庸置疑 爱斯基摩·乔符合我们的要求
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger, no doubt about it.

1290
01:45:39,001 --> 01:45:44,172
但如果是我来付钱 我不会花12000块去买他
But if it was my money, I wouldn't pay no $12,000 for him.

1291
01:45:44,339 --> 01:45:46,675
你会花多少钱?
What would your price be?

1292
01:45:46,842 --> 01:45:48,802
如果我出手阔绰的话
Well, if I was inclined to be generous,

1293
01:45:48,969 --> 01:45:52,431
我不知道他为何值得我出大价钱...
and I don't know why I would be inclined to be generous...

1294
01:45:53,390 --> 01:45:56,643
也许会出九千吧
9,000. Maybe.

1295
01:45:57,894 --> 01:46:03,692
舒尔茨医生 我还是重申一下这次谈判的由来吧
Dr. Schultz, let me reclarify how this whole negotiation came about.

1296
01:46:03,859 --> 01:46:06,028
要知道 并不是我找上你们要卖黑奴的
You see, it wasn't me who came to you to sell a nigger.

1297
01:46:06,194 --> 01:46:07,154
确实不是
Sure wasn't.

1298
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:09,031
是你主动来找我 说要买黑奴的
It was you who approached me to buy one.

1299
01:46:09,197 --> 01:46:11,366
- 的确如此  - 机灵鬼提出的
- Sure was.  - Now, that $9,000 figure

1300
01:46:11,533 --> 01:46:13,952
九千美元这个数字也还算公道
Bright Boy's been bandyin' about, that ain't too far off from right.

1301
01:46:14,119 --> 01:46:15,746
但如果我想以这个价钱卖了爱斯基摩·乔
And if I wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that,

1302
01:46:15,912 --> 01:46:18,874
- 那随时都可以卖出去  - 随时都行
- I could do so any day of the week.  - Any day.

1303
01:46:19,041 --> 01:46:23,295
但就如你在格林维尔所说的 医生... 我不想卖他
But, like you said in Greenville, doctor... I don't want to sell him.

1304
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:27,924
只不过是你出的一万两千美元的好价钱
It was only your ridiculous offer of $12,000

1305
01:46:28,091 --> 01:46:30,927
- 才让我予以考虑的  - 没错
- that made me even consider it.  - Hm-mm.

1306
01:46:39,102 --> 01:46:43,190
要知道 先生坎迪 您这话的确很有说服力
You know, Monsieur Candie, you do possess the power of persuasion.

1307
01:46:47,110 --> 01:46:49,529
好吧 先生坎迪 成交
Why not? Monsieur Candie, you have a deal.

1308
01:46:49,696 --> 01:46:53,033
- 一万二 买爱斯基摩·乔  - 万岁 医生
- Eskimo Joe, $12,000.  - Hooray, doctor.

1309
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:55,327
万岁 真是明智的决断
Hooray. And a wise decision that is.

1310
01:46:55,494 --> 01:46:59,039
然而 这是很大一笔巨款
However, that is a tremendous amount of money.

1311
01:46:59,206 --> 01:47:02,375
就像你有莫吉先生一样 我也有律师
And the way you have your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer.

1312
01:47:02,542 --> 01:47:04,336
一个叫塔托的挑剔鬼
Persnickety man named Tuttle.

1313
01:47:04,503 --> 01:47:07,589
所以在我安心与你一手交钱一手交货之前
And I would need my Mr. Tuttle to draw up a legal contract

1314
01:47:07,756 --> 01:47:10,801
我得让塔托先生起草一份合法的合同
before I'd feel comfortable exchanging that amount of money for flesh.

1315
01:47:10,967 --> 01:47:11,968
可以
Hm-mm.

1316
01:47:12,135 --> 01:47:13,804
当然还得让我指定的医师
Not to mention having Eskimo Joe examined

1317
01:47:13,970 --> 01:47:16,598
- 给爱斯基摩·乔做个检查  - 这是自然
- by a physician of my choosing.  - Naturally.

1318
01:47:16,765 --> 01:47:21,478
这样一来 我大概...
So, say I return in about...

1319
01:47:23,647 --> 01:47:25,941
- 五天后回来  - 五天?
- five days time.  - Five days?

1320
01:47:26,108 --> 01:47:27,359
和T塔托先生一起过来
With my Mr. Tuttle.

1321
01:47:27,526 --> 01:47:29,569
然后就让我的塔托先生和你的莫吉先生
And then my Mr. Tuttle and your Mr. Moguy

1322
01:47:29,736 --> 01:47:32,697
两个人把最后的细节都敲定
can hash out the finer details between themselves.

1323
01:47:33,532 --> 01:47:36,576
我说这真是太棒了 医生 棒极了
I say splendid, doctor. Splendid.

1324
01:47:37,327 --> 01:47:38,495
先生们...
Gentlemen...

1325
01:47:39,496 --> 01:47:41,498
我们来干一杯
may I propose a toast.

1326
01:47:43,875 --> 01:47:48,755
敬爱斯基摩·乔 也许现在该称他为黑人大力神了吧?
To Eskimo Joe. Or shall we call him The Black Hercules?

1327
01:47:48,922 --> 01:47:51,591
敬黑人大力神
To The Black Hercules.

1328
01:47:51,758 --> 01:47:53,135
敬黑人大力神
The Black Hercules.

1329
01:47:53,301 --> 01:47:54,719
敬黑人大力神
To The Black Hercules.

1330
01:47:54,886 --> 01:47:58,723
您说得对 医生 这名字的确响亮
You was right, doctor. That name do have pan-ass.

1331
01:47:58,890 --> 01:48:00,308
真不错
Hm.

1332
01:48:00,475 --> 01:48:03,728
希尔迪 给我满上
Hildi, top my drink off.

1333
01:48:06,815 --> 01:48:11,862
希尔迪 你喜欢在大宅子的晚宴上当侍从吗?
So, Hildi, how you like servin' at the big table in The Big House, huh?

1334
01:48:12,028 --> 01:48:15,240
坎迪先生问你话呢 快点回答
When Monsieur Candie talk to you, you answers.

1335
01:48:15,407 --> 01:48:18,160
- 我很喜欢 坎迪先生  - 是吧
- I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.  - Hm-mm.

1336
01:48:18,326 --> 01:48:21,079
总好过在热箱子里关着 或是在布满荆棘的
It's a lot better than sizzlin' in that Hot Box or draggin' your ass

1337
01:48:21,246 --> 01:48:22,581
灌木丛里奔跑
through a bramble bush.

1338
01:48:22,747 --> 01:48:25,834
但也许却不如取悦那些曼丁哥来得有趣
But maybe it's not quite as much fun as gettin' to pleasure all them Mandingos,

1339
01:48:26,001 --> 01:48:27,586
- 对吧 甜心?  - 天啊 她喜欢那些黑鬼
- huh, sugar bear?  - Oh, Lord, she like them niggers.

1340
01:48:27,752 --> 01:48:28,920
- 的确如此  - 山姆森那种? 喜欢吗?
- Sure do.  - Like Samson? Huh?

1341
01:48:29,087 --> 01:48:30,547
不喜欢 先生
No, sir.

1342
01:48:30,714 --> 01:48:32,048
要知道 坎迪先生
You know, Monsieur Candie,

1343
01:48:32,215 --> 01:48:35,886
医生看到希尔迪伤痕累累的后背时 可能很感兴趣
the doctor here might be interested in seein' Hildi's peeled back,

1344
01:48:36,052 --> 01:48:39,306
因为他们德国没有什么黑奴
seein' as how they don't have many niggers where he come from.

1345
01:48:39,472 --> 01:48:41,600
舒尔茨医生 你和希尔迪独处的时候
Dr. Schultz, when you was alone with Hildi, here,

1346
01:48:41,766 --> 01:48:44,811
就说说德语呢 还是脱了她的衣服?
did you just speak German or did you get to take her clothes off?

1347
01:48:44,978 --> 01:48:46,730
不 我们只是聊了聊...
No, we just talked and...

1348
01:48:46,897 --> 01:48:49,274
所以你没看过她的背?
Oh, so you haven't seen her back?

1349
01:48:49,441 --> 01:48:51,234
- 没有...  - 不 这不对
- I haven't...  - No, no, no, no.

1350
01:48:51,401 --> 01:48:53,445
史蒂芬说得对 你也许会觉得这个很有趣
Stephen's right, you might find this interesting.

1351
01:48:53,612 --> 01:48:56,698
希尔迪 快点 把衣服脱了 让舒尔茨医生看看你的背
Hildi, go on, take off your dress. Show Dr. Schultz your back here.

1352
01:48:56,865 --> 01:48:58,825
- 快点  - 呃 卡尔文
- Go on.  - Uh, Calvin.

1353
01:48:58,992 --> 01:49:01,369
我可是才把她收拾妥当 打扮漂亮的
I just got her all dressed up and lookin' nice.

1354
01:49:01,536 --> 01:49:04,456
劳拉·李 可舒尔茨医生是从杜塞尔多夫来的
But, Lara Lee, Dr. Schultz is from Dusseldorf.

1355
01:49:04,623 --> 01:49:07,626
他们那儿可没有黑奴 他是个医生
They don't got niggers there. He is a man of medicine.

1356
01:49:07,792 --> 01:49:10,378
我想黑人对疼痛的忍耐力肯定会让他惊奇的
I'm sure it would fascinate him, the niggers' endurance for pain.

1357
01:49:10,545 --> 01:49:14,132
毫无疑问 舒尔茨医生 这些黑奴坚强着呢
These niggers are tough, Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.

1358
01:49:14,299 --> 01:49:16,468
希尔迪背上有四道鞭痕
Hildi's got somethin' like four lashes on her back.

1359
01:49:16,635 --> 01:49:18,553
要是劳拉·李被抽上一鞭 肯定早就晕过去了
Lara Lee just get one, she'd lose her goddamn mind.

1360
01:49:18,762 --> 01:49:19,846
- 确实如此  - 看看 医生
- Sure would.  - Look at that, doctor.

1361
01:49:20,013 --> 01:49:22,265
- 看看 就像一幅画一样  - 卡尔文!
- It's like a paintin'. Look at that.  - Calvin!

1362
01:49:23,058 --> 01:49:26,102
我们还在吃饭呢 而且也没人想看她的背
We are eating. Ain't no one wanna look at her whipped up back.

1363
01:49:27,771 --> 01:49:30,190
好 好吧 不看了
Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine.

1364
01:49:30,357 --> 01:49:33,026
留到晚饭后 史蒂芬 晚饭后再看
After dinner, then, Stephen. After dinner.

1365
01:49:34,236 --> 01:49:36,029
先生 喝酒的时候再看 如何?
During the brandies, gentlemen, hm?

1366
01:49:42,410 --> 01:49:43,954
科拉 把这姑娘带下去!
Cora, come get this girl!

1367
01:49:47,415 --> 01:49:50,627
- 她被弄得一团糟  - 是 夫人 噢!
- She a mess.  - Yes, ma'am. Oh!

1368
01:49:50,794 --> 01:49:53,255
你的衣服怎么解开了? 我才给你穿好的
Why are you all undone? I just got you done up.

1369
01:49:53,421 --> 01:49:54,756
跟我过来
Come on in here.

1370
01:50:01,263 --> 01:50:05,058
你真是惹到史蒂芬了 你得顺他的意
Baby, you on Stephen bad side, and you need to be on his blind side.

1371
01:50:05,225 --> 01:50:07,185
你说你不认识他
You say you ain't know him.

1372
01:50:08,311 --> 01:50:09,396
什么?
Huh?

1373
01:50:09,562 --> 01:50:15,151
我是说 你刚才说你不认识他
I said, you said you ain't know him.

1374
01:50:16,319 --> 01:50:19,698
- 不认识  - 不 你认识
- I don't.  - Yes, you do.

1375
01:50:21,866 --> 01:50:23,493
史蒂芬先生...
Mr. Stephen...

1376
01:50:24,494 --> 01:50:25,495
我不认识他
I don't.

1377
01:50:25,662 --> 01:50:28,164
你为什么要对我撒谎?
Why is you lying to me?

1378
01:50:30,542 --> 01:50:31,876
我没有
I ain't.

1379
01:50:32,043 --> 01:50:34,546
那你为什么哭?
Then why is you crying?

1380
01:50:34,713 --> 01:50:36,881
你吓到我了?
You scarin' me.

1381
01:50:37,048 --> 01:50:40,969
- 我怎么吓到你了?  - 因为你这样很恐怖
- Why is I'm scaring you?  - Because you scary.

1382
01:50:42,637 --> 01:50:45,724
今天下午和希尔迪说德语
To speak German this afternoon with Hildi

1383
01:50:45,890 --> 01:50:49,019
真是让我满心欢喜
was positively soul-enriching.

1384
01:50:49,185 --> 01:50:52,063
医生 您这话让我受宠若惊
Doctor, that warms my heart to hear that.

1385
01:50:52,230 --> 01:50:55,066
你待在这儿
You stay right here.

1386
01:51:00,405 --> 01:51:04,909
您之前说 您愿意卖掉希尔迪
You indicated earlier you'd be willing to part with Hildi.

1387
01:51:05,076 --> 01:51:07,912
没错 我的确这么说过
Why, yes. Yessiree bob, I did.

1388
01:51:09,914 --> 01:51:15,879
这样的话 允许我再说个提议
In that case, allow me to propose another proposition.

1389
01:51:16,046 --> 01:51:17,422
洗耳恭听
I'm all ears.

1390
01:51:17,589 --> 01:51:19,299
快点 真该死!
Hurry up, goddamn it!

1391
01:51:19,924 --> 01:51:21,509
- 先生坎迪...  - 史蒂芬!
- Monsieur Candie...  - Stephen!

1392
01:51:22,552 --> 01:51:25,013
你打断了舒尔茨医生说话
You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here.

1393
01:51:26,139 --> 01:51:28,266
很抱歉 舒尔茨医生
I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz.

1394
01:51:28,433 --> 01:51:31,144
我的耳朵最近越来越不好使了
My ears ain't worth a damn these days.

1395
01:51:31,311 --> 01:51:32,437
请原谅他
Excuse him.

1396
01:51:32,604 --> 01:51:36,358
坎迪先生 您可否到厨房 我跟你说几句话?
Monsieur Candie, could I get a word with you in the kitchen?

1397
01:51:36,524 --> 01:51:38,443
你是说让我离开我的椅子?
You mean get up out of my chair?

1398
01:51:38,610 --> 01:51:41,946
- 希望您能来一趟  - 为什么?
- If'n you could manage it.  - Why?

1399
01:51:42,113 --> 01:51:45,950
- 是甜品的事  - 甜品怎么了?
- It's about dessert.  - What about dessert?

1400
01:51:46,117 --> 01:51:48,745
我想私下和您说
I'd rather discuss that in private.

1401
01:51:48,912 --> 01:51:50,789
我们要吃清蛋糕!
We're having white cake!

1402
01:51:50,955 --> 01:51:53,291
后厨还能发生什么闹剧呢?
What sort of melodrama could be brewing back there?

1403
01:51:53,458 --> 01:51:57,796
您说得对 先生坎迪 我自己解决
You right, Monsieur Candie. You right. I'll handle it myself.

1404
01:51:57,962 --> 01:51:59,756
我在书房等你
Meet me in the library.

1405
01:51:59,923 --> 01:52:03,009
我就是不明白您为什么不愿到后厨和那些黑人谈谈
I just can't understand why you won't come talk to these niggers.

1406
01:52:03,176 --> 01:52:05,053
要是事情出了什么岔子 您可别怨我
Shit get fucked up around here, you blame me.

1407
01:52:05,220 --> 01:52:10,225
好吧! 好吧 亲爱的史蒂芬 我马上就过去
Fine! Fine. Friend Stephen, I will be along momentarily.

1408
01:52:10,392 --> 01:52:11,559
好的 先生
Yes, sir.

1409
01:52:12,477 --> 01:52:16,147
好吧 先生们 你们也看到了
Well, gentlemen, as you can see,

1410
01:52:16,314 --> 01:52:18,066
虽然毫无疑问 他们做菜很棒
talented as they are, no doubt, in the kitchen,

1411
01:52:18,233 --> 01:52:21,861
但偶尔还是需要家长来监管一下
from time to time, adult supervision is required.

1412
01:52:24,864 --> 01:52:26,658
请恕我失陪片刻
If you'll excuse me a moment.

1413
01:52:32,831 --> 01:52:34,624
你们可以去收盘子了
You may clear the dinner service.

1414
01:52:36,084 --> 01:52:39,462
都听到了 快点! 快点 姑娘们
You heard him. Go on! Get! Hurry up, girl.

1415
01:52:39,629 --> 01:52:45,051
舒尔茨医生 您跟我们说说马戏团的故事吧
So, Dr. Schultz, why don't you regale us with a tale of the circus.

1416
01:52:45,218 --> 01:52:47,887
马戏团?
The circus?

1417
01:52:54,352 --> 01:52:56,146
怎么了?
What is the matter?

1418
01:53:01,401 --> 01:53:06,489
那俩家伙根本不是来买曼丁哥人的
Them motherfuckers ain't here to buy no Mandingos.

1419
01:53:06,656 --> 01:53:10,201
他们想要的是那女孩
They wants that girl.

1420
01:53:10,368 --> 01:53:13,121
史蒂芬 你到底在说什么呢? 嗯?
Stephen, what the hell are you talking about? Hm?

1421
01:53:13,288 --> 01:53:16,458
我是说 他们就是在把您当傻子耍
They playing your ass for a fool is what I'm talking about.

1422
01:53:16,624 --> 01:53:20,295
他们根本不是来买强壮的黑奴
They ain't here for no musclebound Jimmie.

1423
01:53:20,462 --> 01:53:22,630
他们是来找那女孩的
They here for that girl.

1424
01:53:22,797 --> 01:53:25,425
哪... 哪个女孩? 希尔迪吗?
Wh... what girl? Hildi?

1425
01:53:25,592 --> 01:53:29,220
没错 就是希尔迪 她和姜戈相互都认识
Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django, them niggers know each other.

1426
01:53:30,930 --> 01:53:32,515
他刚买了爱斯基摩·乔
He just bought Eskimo Joe.

1427
01:53:32,682 --> 01:53:35,059
- 他付钱给您了吗?  - 不! 还没有 但...
- Did he give you any money?  - No! Not yet. But...

1428
01:53:35,226 --> 01:53:37,687
那到目前为止 他还什么都没买
Then he ain't bought diddly. Not yet, nohow.

1429
01:53:37,854 --> 01:53:40,106
若不是刚才我打断他
But he's just about to buy

1430
01:53:40,273 --> 01:53:43,485
他差点就要把那女孩买到手了
who he come here to buy when I interrupted him.

1431
01:53:43,651 --> 01:53:46,654
不用谢我
"Thank you, Stephen." You're welcome, Calvin.

1432
01:53:52,076 --> 01:53:54,078
你是怎么想出来的?
Where you gettin' all this?

1433
01:53:55,205 --> 01:53:56,998
他们干嘛要大费周章 只是为了买下一个
Why would they go through all that trouble for a nigger

1434
01:53:57,165 --> 01:53:59,667
背上有鞭伤 连300美金都不值的黑奴?
with a chewed up back, ain't worth $300?

1435
01:53:59,834 --> 01:54:04,130
他们这么做是因为姜戈爱着希尔迪
They doin' it 'cause that nigger Django's in love with Hildi.

1436
01:54:04,297 --> 01:54:06,132
她可能就是他老婆
She probably his wife.

1437
01:54:06,299 --> 01:54:09,093
至于那个德国佬干嘛要帮这个黑鬼情圣
Now, why that German gives a fuck who that uppity son of a bitch

1438
01:54:09,260 --> 01:54:12,347
我肯定就不知道了
is in love with, I'm sure I don't know.

1439
01:54:14,933 --> 01:54:16,893
如果她才是他们想买的...
If she's who they want...

1440
01:54:17,477 --> 01:54:21,773
干嘛还要绕弯子 扮成来买曼丁哥人呢?
why this whole snake oil pitch about Mandingos, then?

1441
01:54:21,940 --> 01:54:25,443
您根本不会在乎区区300美金
You wouldn't pay no never mind to no $300.

1442
01:54:25,610 --> 01:54:31,074
但要是一万两千美金呢? 你一定不想错过这笔生意 是吧?
But that 12,000? That made you real friendly, now, didn't it?

1443
01:54:33,785 --> 01:54:35,453
的确如此
Yes, it did.

1444
01:54:38,790 --> 01:54:40,416
他老婆是吧?
His wife, huh?

1445
01:54:44,295 --> 01:54:48,007
如果那是一条蛇 我早就被咬了
If it had been a snake, it would have bit me.

1446
01:54:51,302 --> 01:54:53,304
那两个满嘴谎言...
Those lying...

1447
01:54:54,138 --> 01:55:00,144
浪费我时间的混蛋
goddamn time-wastin' sons of bitches.

1448
01:55:02,355 --> 01:55:03,523
该死的混蛋!
Sons of bitches!

1449
01:55:04,148 --> 01:55:08,945
我离开了新奥尔良 所以才能去很多剧院看演出
Out of New Orleans, so I have quite a bit of practice with theater types.

1450
01:55:10,196 --> 01:55:11,656
噢 你终于回来了
Oh, there you are.

1451
01:55:11,823 --> 01:55:14,617
我都开始以为你和那个老乌鸦一起逃跑了呢
I was beginning to think that you and that old crow run off together.

1452
01:55:16,411 --> 01:55:18,580
那会是个噩耗 对吧?
That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?

1453
01:55:18,746 --> 01:55:21,833
劳拉·李 我刚往大窗户那儿看了一眼
Lara Lee, I was just looking out the big window.

1454
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:25,044
比利·克劳什在外面打发几个来卖
Billy Crash is out there dealing with some shady slaver

1455
01:55:25,211 --> 01:55:26,296
一群小马驹的黑奴
trying to sell a passel of ponies.

1456
01:55:26,462 --> 01:55:30,341
你能好心地替我出去看着他们吗? 可以吗?
Would you be a dear, go out there and give them gals an eyeball? Hm?

1457
01:55:30,508 --> 01:55:32,760
- 当然可以 哥哥  - 谢谢 亲爱的
- Of course, brother.  - Thank you, darling.

1458
01:55:46,024 --> 01:55:49,736
- 没错 生意就没有停歇的时候  - 的确
- Yeah. Business never sleeps.  - Hm-mm.

1459
01:55:51,779 --> 01:55:54,699
话说回来 在您离开前
Apropos, before your exit,

1460
01:55:54,866 --> 01:55:58,870
我们正讨论到 我是否能买下布隆希达的问题
we were discussing the possibility of my purchasing Broomhilda.

1461
01:55:59,037 --> 01:56:01,956
对 没错 医生
Ah, yes. Yes, we were, doctor.

1462
01:56:02,123 --> 01:56:04,250
我们稍后再接着谈
And we will again. In a moment.

1463
01:56:20,725 --> 01:56:22,769
这位是谁?
Who's your little friend?

1464
01:56:27,732 --> 01:56:29,233
这是本
This is Ben.

1465
01:56:30,568 --> 01:56:35,573
他是很久以前住在这儿的一个老黑鬼
He's a old Joe that lived around here for a long time.

1466
01:56:35,740 --> 01:56:38,159
我是说很久很久以前
And I do mean a long damn time.

1467
01:56:39,243 --> 01:56:42,997
老本在这儿照顾我爸爸...
Old Ben here took care of my daddy...

1468
01:56:43,873 --> 01:56:45,917
还有我爷爷
and my daddy's daddy.

1469
01:56:46,084 --> 01:56:48,670
等有一天我爸爸死了之后...
Till he up and keeled over one day...

1470
01:56:51,506 --> 01:56:53,174
老本就开始照顾我
Old Ben took care of me.

1471
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:59,555
身为密西西比州大农场主的儿子
Growing up the son of a huge plantation owner in Mississippi

1472
01:56:59,722 --> 01:57:05,603
能让一个白人 接触到许多黑鬼
puts a white man in contact with a whole lotta black faces.

1473
01:57:07,230 --> 01:57:12,527
我的一生都在这里度过 就在糖果农场...
I spent my whole life here, right here in Candyland...

1474
01:57:13,778 --> 01:57:17,573
身边都是黑鬼
surrounded by black faces.

1475
01:57:19,617 --> 01:57:21,953
每天看着他们忙进忙出
Now, seeing them every day, day in, day out,

1476
01:57:22,120 --> 01:57:25,289
我只有一个问题:
I only had one question:

1477
01:57:29,001 --> 01:57:31,462
他们干嘛不杀了我们?
Why don't they kill us?

1478
01:57:34,465 --> 01:57:39,637
就在那个回廊 一连五十年 每周三次
Now, right out there on that porch, three times a week for 50 years,

1479
01:57:39,804 --> 01:57:44,726
老本都会用一把剃刀给我爸爸刮胡子
Old Ben here would shave my daddy with a straight razor.

1480
01:57:44,892 --> 01:57:50,022
如果我是老本 肯定会用剃刀划开我爸的喉咙
Now, if I was Old Ben, I woulda cut my daddy's goddamn throat

1481
01:57:50,189 --> 01:57:53,609
然后就不用花五十年给他当牛做马了
and it wouldn't have taken me no 50 years to do it, neither.

1482
01:57:56,154 --> 01:57:57,655
但他没有
But he never did.

1483
01:57:59,532 --> 01:58:00,825
为什么?
Why not?

1484
01:58:02,201 --> 01:58:06,998
要知道 颅相学
You see, the science of phrenology

1485
01:58:07,165 --> 01:58:12,253
是理解两个人种区别的关键
is crucial to understanding the separation of our two species.

1486
01:58:14,088 --> 01:58:17,800
看非洲人的头骨
In the skull of the African here,

1487
01:58:17,967 --> 01:58:20,094
管辖服从命令的区域
the area associated with submissiveness

1488
01:58:20,261 --> 01:58:25,767
比地球上任何其他人种的都要大
is larger than any human or any other subhuman species on planet Earth.

1489
01:58:41,282 --> 01:58:43,242
如果你检查一下...
If you examine...

1490
01:58:44,619 --> 01:58:46,788
这块头骨...
this piece of skull here...

1491
01:58:53,085 --> 01:58:56,672
会看到上面有三个明显的凹陷
you will notice three distinct dimples.

1492
01:59:00,259 --> 01:59:03,971
这儿 这儿 还有这儿
Here, here and here.

1493
01:59:04,138 --> 01:59:05,389
现在...
Now...

1494
01:59:05,556 --> 01:59:10,561
如果我拿着的是艾萨克·牛顿或是伽利略的头骨
if I was holding the skull of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,

1495
01:59:10,728 --> 01:59:13,231
那么这三个凹陷应该会出现在
these three dimples would be found in the area of the skull

1496
01:59:13,397 --> 01:59:16,734
管辖创造力的... 区域
most associated with... creativity.

1497
01:59:17,401 --> 01:59:19,237
但这是老本的头骨
But this is the skull of Old Ben.

1498
01:59:19,862 --> 01:59:21,989
而在他的头骨上
And in the skull of Old Ben,

1499
01:59:22,156 --> 01:59:24,450
这三个凹陷处
unburdened by genius,

1500
01:59:24,617 --> 01:59:28,788
并非在和天才一样的区域 而是在管辖...
these three dimples exist in the area of the skull most associated with...

1501
01:59:29,914 --> 01:59:31,249
奴性的地方
servility.

1502
01:59:32,250 --> 01:59:34,001
机灵鬼...
Now, Bright Boy...

1503
01:59:34,919 --> 01:59:37,088
我承认你很聪明
I will admit you are pretty clever.

1504
01:59:39,549 --> 01:59:41,634
但如果我拿这把榔头...
But if I took this hammer here...

1505
01:59:43,761 --> 01:59:46,097
砸开你的头骨...
and I bashed in your skull with it...

1506
01:59:47,098 --> 01:59:52,436
你会发现你的三个凹陷 就在和老本头骨...
you would have the same three dimples in the same place...

1507
01:59:53,688 --> 01:59:55,147
同样的位置
as Old Ben.

1508
01:59:56,274 --> 01:59:59,861
嘿! 把手放在桌上!
Hey! Now lay your palms flat on that tabletop!

1509
02:00:00,027 --> 02:00:02,989
如果你们的手离开了桌面
If you lift those palms off that turtle shell tabletop,

1510
02:00:03,155 --> 02:00:06,409
普奇先生就会开枪 把你们射成马蜂窝
Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose with both barrels of that sawed-off.

1511
02:00:07,493 --> 02:00:10,621
虽然今晚在这餐桌上大家说的没几句真话
There have been a lot of lies said around this dinner table here tonight,

1512
02:00:10,788 --> 02:00:13,124
但这句是真的!
but that you can believe!

1513
02:00:13,291 --> 02:00:16,085
莫吉先生 能劳驾你帮忙把他们皮带上的枪
Mr. Moguy, would you be so kind as to collect the pistol

1514
02:00:16,252 --> 02:00:18,629
都收起来吗?
hanging off these boys' hips here?

1515
02:00:23,342 --> 02:00:25,761
- 非常感谢  - 医生
- Thank you ever so much.  - Doctor.

1516
02:00:30,308 --> 02:00:31,684
我们说到哪儿了?
Where were we?

1517
02:00:36,147 --> 02:00:37,565
傻瓜
Jackass.

1518
02:00:41,569 --> 02:00:43,070
对了
Ah, yes.

1519
02:00:43,237 --> 02:00:45,990
我想你刚才正想跟我提议
I do believe you were just getting ready to make me

1520
02:00:46,157 --> 02:00:48,618
要买下布隆希达
a proposition to buy Broomhilda.

1521
02:00:48,784 --> 02:00:50,161
我没说错吧?
Am I right?

1522
02:00:54,165 --> 02:00:55,499
没错
Right.

1523
02:00:57,919 --> 02:00:59,420
把希尔迪带过来!
Bring out Hildi!

1524
02:01:02,173 --> 02:01:03,716
站到那边去
Get over there yonder.

1525
02:01:05,176 --> 02:01:07,428
坐到椅子上...
Sit your ass in that goddamn...

1526
02:01:07,595 --> 02:01:08,846
把双手放在桌上
Lay your hand flat on that tabletop.

1527
02:01:09,013 --> 02:01:10,556
然后闭嘴!
Now shut your mouth!

1528
02:01:14,852 --> 02:01:17,438
舒尔茨医生 在格林维尔
Dr. Schultz, in Greenville,

1529
02:01:17,605 --> 02:01:20,358
你自己说 只要是你相中的黑奴
you yourself said that for the right nigger

1530
02:01:20,524 --> 02:01:24,862
你愿意支付其他人认为荒谬的天价
you'd be willin' to pay what some may consider is a ridiculous amount.

1531
02:01:25,029 --> 02:01:28,074
我的回答是"您所说的天价是多少?"
To which me myself said, "What is your definition of ridiculous?"

1532
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:32,203
你回答说"一万两千美元"
To which you said, "$12,000."

1533
02:01:32,995 --> 02:01:34,747
想你们俩
Now, considering y'all

1534
02:01:34,914 --> 02:01:36,874
不远万里骑马过来
have ridden a whole lot of miles,

1535
02:01:37,041 --> 02:01:41,003
费尽周折 为了要买这位姑娘
went through a whole lot of trouble, and done spread a whole lot of bull

1536
02:01:41,170 --> 02:01:43,589
想尽一切办法
to purchase this lovely lady right here,

1537
02:01:43,756 --> 02:01:49,720
事实上... 布隆希达才是你相中的黑奴
it would appear that Broomhilda is, in fact... the right nigger.

1538
02:01:49,887 --> 02:01:53,641
如果你们想带着布隆希达离开糖果农场
And if y'all want to leave Candyland with Broomhilda,

1539
02:01:53,808 --> 02:01:59,438
价钱就是一万二
the price is $12,000.

1540
02:01:59,605 --> 02:02:03,401
我是否可以理解为你比较喜欢"不买就滚"式的谈判?
And I take it you prefer the "take it or leave it" style of negotiation?

1541
02:02:05,653 --> 02:02:07,196
的确如此 医生
Yes, I do, doctor.

1542
02:02:08,030 --> 02:02:11,033
要知道 根据奇克索县的法律
You see, under the laws of Chickasaw County,

1543
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:14,745
布隆希达是我的财产
Broomhilda here is my property.

1544
02:02:14,912 --> 02:02:20,042
而我可以对自己的财产任意处置!
And I can choose to do with my property whatever I so desire!

1545
02:02:21,127 --> 02:02:23,421
如果你们觉得我对这个黑奴...
And if y'all think my price...

1546
02:02:24,088 --> 02:02:26,799
开的价钱太离谱...
for this nigger here is too steep...

1547
02:02:26,966 --> 02:02:30,428
那我想做的是...
what I'm gonna desire to do is...

1548
02:02:34,348 --> 02:02:37,476
拿起这把榔头 活活把她砸死!
take this goddamn hammer here and beat her ass to death with it!

1549
02:02:37,643 --> 02:02:39,770
- 就在你们两个面前!  - 坐下 大个子
- Right in front of both y'all!  - Easy, big fella.

1550
02:02:39,937 --> 02:02:44,442
然后我们就能一起检查布隆希达头骨里的那三个凹陷了!
Then we can examine the three dimples inside Broomhilda's skull!

1551
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:48,779
那你怎么说 医生? 怎样?
Now, what's it gonna be, doc? Huh?

1552
02:02:48,946 --> 02:02:50,281
你怎么说?
What's it gonna be?

1553
02:02:50,448 --> 02:02:54,326
我的手能不能离开桌面 拿一下皮夹呢?
May I lift the hands off the tabletop in order to remove my billfold?

1554
02:02:55,536 --> 02:02:56,871
当然可以
Yes, you may.

1555
02:03:10,634 --> 02:03:11,844
一万二
That 12.

1556
02:03:15,890 --> 02:03:17,767
成交!
Sold!

1557
02:03:17,933 --> 02:03:20,478
恭喜这位胡子精致的先生
To the man with the exceptional beard

1558
02:03:20,644 --> 02:03:23,981
以及他的烂黑奴拍得
and his unexceptional nigger.

1559
02:03:29,820 --> 02:03:32,114
- 莫吉先生  - 什么事 卡尔文?
- Mr. Moguy.  - Yes, Calvin?

1560
02:03:32,281 --> 02:03:35,951
能请你给这两位先生一张一万两千美元的收据吗?
Will you make these gentlemen a receipt for $12,000, please?

1561
02:03:36,118 --> 02:03:37,870
一万二
$12,000.

1562
02:03:40,998 --> 02:03:43,167
和你们的交易真是愉快
It was a pleasure doing business with y'all.

1563
02:03:44,043 --> 02:03:45,795
先生们...
Now, gentlemen...

1564
02:03:47,004 --> 02:03:48,881
请随我到客厅...
if you care to join me in the parlor...

1565
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:52,301
享用清蛋糕
we will be serving white cake.

1566
02:05:20,639 --> 02:05:21,974
干得好 卡尔文
Well done, Calvin.

1567
02:05:24,476 --> 02:05:27,354
抱歉 能停一下吗 女士?
Excuse me. Excuse me, ma'am?

1568
02:05:28,814 --> 02:05:32,484
能不能别再谈贝多芬的曲子了? 把手从竖琴上拿开!
Could you please stop playing Beethoven? Take your hands off the harp!

1569
02:05:36,739 --> 02:05:37,823
医生!
Doctor!

1570
02:05:37,990 --> 02:05:40,618
- 医生 你不能进去!  - 史蒂芬 史蒂芬
- Doctor, you can't go in there!  - Stephen, Stephen.

1571
02:05:40,784 --> 02:05:41,952
他进那里又没什么事
He ain't got no business going in there.

1572
02:05:42,119 --> 02:05:43,454
让他去吧
Let it be.

1573
02:05:43,621 --> 02:05:45,539
他就是有点心烦 随他去吧
He's just a little upset, that's all.

1574
02:05:45,706 --> 02:05:47,124
我来处理
I'll handle this.

1575
02:06:12,983 --> 02:06:14,276
清蛋糕?
White cake?

1576
02:06:15,277 --> 02:06:17,529
我不吃甜食 谢谢
I don't go in for sweets, thank you.

1577
02:06:18,572 --> 02:06:19,782
好吧
Hm.

1578
02:06:27,498 --> 02:06:30,209
你现在满心都在怨恨我 是吧?
You brooding about me getting the best of you, huh?

1579
02:06:30,918 --> 02:06:35,673
事实上 我在想你今天喂了狗的那个可怜黑奴
Actually, I was thinking of that poor devil you fed to the dogs today.

1580
02:06:35,839 --> 02:06:37,675
达达尼安
D'Artagnan.

1581
02:06:38,467 --> 02:06:42,263
我在想大仲马对此会有何看法
And I was wondering what Dumas would make of all this.

1582
02:06:42,429 --> 02:06:43,889
谁?
Come again?

1583
02:06:46,976 --> 02:06:51,021
亚历山大·仲马 "三剑客"的作者
Alexandre Dumas. He wrote The Three Musketeers.

1584
02:06:51,188 --> 02:06:52,856
对 就是他 医生
Yes, of course, doctor.

1585
02:06:53,023 --> 02:06:54,566
我想你一定很赞赏他
I figured you must be an admirer.

1586
02:06:54,733 --> 02:06:59,154
都用他作品的主角来命名自己的奴隶了
You named your slave after his novel's lead character.

1587
02:06:59,321 --> 02:07:03,033
如果亚历山大·仲马今天在这儿
Now, if Alexandre Dumas had been there today,

1588
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:05,160
我在想他会怎么说
I wonder what he would have made of it.

1589
02:07:07,204 --> 02:07:09,039
你觉得他不会同意吗?
You doubt he'd approve, huh?

1590
02:07:11,250 --> 02:07:16,422
没错 他的同意那就怪了
Yes. His approval would be a dubious proposition at best.

1591
02:07:18,716 --> 02:07:20,509
法国人都很心软
Soft-hearted Frenchie.

1592
02:07:22,386 --> 02:07:24,596
亚历山大·仲马是黑人
Alexandre Dumas is black.

1593
02:07:28,434 --> 02:07:31,228
- 这是布隆希达的文件吗?  - 没错
- Are these Broomhilda's papers?  - Yes, they are.

1594
02:07:31,395 --> 02:07:33,063
- 我能看看吗?  - 当然
- May I?  - Of course.

1595
02:07:33,230 --> 02:07:34,606
谢谢
Thank you.

1596
02:07:36,734 --> 02:07:39,695
这是她的出售证明 历任主人的清单
That is her bill of sale, her ownership history,

1597
02:07:39,862 --> 02:07:42,031
当然还有她的卖身契 医生
and, of course, her freedom papers, doctor.

1598
02:07:42,197 --> 02:07:44,408
能借我笔和墨水吗?
Would you have ink and pen for me?

1599
02:07:45,659 --> 02:07:48,579
- 就在那边的小桌子上  - 谢谢
- Right over there on that little table.  - Thank you.

1600
02:08:09,892 --> 02:08:11,101
谢谢
Thank you.

1601
02:08:14,688 --> 02:08:16,982
布隆希达·沙夫特女士...
Broomhilda Von Shaft...

1602
02:08:19,234 --> 02:08:21,612
你自由了
consider yourself a free woman.

1603
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:35,501
坎迪先生...
Mr. Candie...

1604
02:08:37,461 --> 02:08:41,256
通常我会说"再会"
normally, I would say auf wiedersehen.

1605
02:08:41,423 --> 02:08:45,886
但事实上 "再会"带有"期待再次相会"的意思
But since what auf Wiedersehen actually means is "till I see you again"

1606
02:08:46,053 --> 02:08:48,389
而我一点都不想再见到你
and since I never wish to see you again,

1607
02:08:48,555 --> 02:08:53,227
所以我要说 永别了
to you, sir... I say, "goodbye."

1608
02:08:57,106 --> 02:08:58,399
我们走吧
Let's go.

1609
02:08:59,358 --> 02:09:00,901
快点
Come on.

1610
02:09:02,611 --> 02:09:04,696
等一下 医生
One more moment, doctor!

1611
02:09:06,573 --> 02:09:07,616
什么事?
What?

1612
02:09:12,329 --> 02:09:14,456
我们南部有个惯例...
It's a custom here in the South...

1613
02:09:14,957 --> 02:09:20,337
两方生意谈拢之后握手
once a business deal is concluded that the two parties shake hands.

1614
02:09:21,171 --> 02:09:23,215
以表美好的祝愿
It implies good faith.

1615
02:09:23,382 --> 02:09:26,427
- 但我可不是南方人  - 但你现在...
- I'm not from the South.  - But you are...

1616
02:09:26,593 --> 02:09:28,887
在我家 医生
in my house, doctor.

1617
02:09:29,763 --> 02:09:32,683
- 所以我坚持要握手  - 坚持?
- So I'm afraid I must insist.  - Insist?

1618
02:09:32,850 --> 02:09:34,852
坚持什么? 和我握手?
On what? That I shake your hand?

1619
02:09:35,018 --> 02:09:38,313
哦 这样的话 我恐怕要坚持不握手了
Oh, then I'm afraid I must insist in the opposite direction.

1620
02:09:38,939 --> 02:09:41,942
- 你知道我怎么看你吗?  - 你怎么看我?
- You know what I think you are?  - What you think I am?

1621
02:09:42,109 --> 02:09:43,902
不知道
No, I don't.

1622
02:09:45,571 --> 02:09:50,784
- 你当你废材一个  - 而我觉得你是个无耻的赢家
- I think you are a bad loser.  - And I think you're an abysmal winner.

1623
02:09:50,951 --> 02:09:55,914
虽然如此 但在奇克索县 不握手
Nevertheless, here in Chickasaw County, a deal ain't done

1624
02:09:56,081 --> 02:09:58,709
生意就不算完成
until the two parties have shook hands.

1625
02:09:59,585 --> 02:10:02,421
就算签好了法律文件 也没用...
Even after all that paper signin', don't mean shit...

1626
02:10:03,380 --> 02:10:06,884
因为你不握手
you don't shake my hand.

1627
02:10:07,843 --> 02:10:13,515
如果我过来握手 你会不要这12000美金?
If I don't shake your hand, you're gonna throw away $12,000?

1628
02:10:13,682 --> 02:10:15,434
我不这么觉得
I don't think so.

1629
02:10:16,435 --> 02:10:17,603
普奇先生?
Mr. Pooch?

1630
02:10:19,438 --> 02:10:24,151
在这个德国佬跟我握手之前 如果她敢动一下的话
If she tries to leave here before this nigger-loving German shakes my hand,

1631
02:10:24,318 --> 02:10:26,069
把她给我废了
you cut her ass down.

1632
02:10:48,091 --> 02:10:51,428
你真的想要我和你握手吗?
You really want me to shake your hand?

1633
02:10:53,096 --> 02:10:54,681
必须如此
I insist.

1634
02:10:55,766 --> 02:10:58,435
既然你这么说了
If you insist.

1635
02:11:15,035 --> 02:11:18,038
天啊! 卡尔文!
No! Calvin!

1636
02:11:19,122 --> 02:11:20,707
卡尔文!
Calvin!

1637
02:11:27,047 --> 02:11:29,550
对不起 我说过别握的
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

1638
02:11:41,812 --> 02:11:43,981
黑鬼发疯了! 救命啊!
Nigger's gone crazy! Help!

1639
02:11:44,147 --> 02:11:45,941
救命啊 他大开杀戒啦!
Help, he's killing everyone!

1640
02:11:51,905 --> 02:11:52,948
啊!
Ah!

1641
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,126
见鬼了..!
Holy...!

1642
02:12:04,293 --> 02:12:06,503
操! 混蛋!
Shit! Son of a bitch!

1643
02:12:10,674 --> 02:12:11,883
见鬼! 我操...!
Damn it! Fuckin'...!

1644
02:12:12,050 --> 02:12:14,386
- 给我...!
- Get the...!

1645
02:12:16,388 --> 02:12:17,848
见鬼 混蛋!
Damn it, son of a bitch!

1646
02:12:18,015 --> 02:12:19,558
什么...? 见鬼了...
What...? Fucking...

1647
02:12:19,725 --> 02:12:21,351
操蛋操蛋!
Goddamn it!

1648
02:12:22,686 --> 02:12:24,980
这他妈是什么情况?
What the fuck is going on?

1649
02:12:25,147 --> 02:12:27,107
你打到我了!
You shot me!

1650
02:12:27,274 --> 02:12:30,360
- 你个没脑子的白痴!  - 对不住了 杰西!
- You stupid son of a bitch!  - Sorry, Jessie!

1651
02:12:30,527 --> 02:12:34,656
哪个操蛋的给黑鬼枪的啊?
Who the fuck gave a nigger a goddamn gun?

1652
02:13:04,686 --> 02:13:05,812
瞄低点!
Aim low!

1653
02:13:08,148 --> 02:13:09,983
黑鬼! 天杀的...!
Nigger! Gonna kill...!

1654
02:13:10,942 --> 02:13:13,111
天啊! 我的天啊!
God! Oh, my God!

1655
02:13:13,278 --> 02:13:15,238
操他妈的!
Motherfucker!

1656
02:13:24,081 --> 02:13:25,248
见鬼!
Shit!

1657
02:14:22,222 --> 02:14:23,306
见鬼!
Shit.

1658
02:14:35,485 --> 02:14:36,903
停火!
Hold your fire!

1659
02:14:40,323 --> 02:14:41,825
停火!
Hold your fire!

1660
02:14:43,744 --> 02:14:45,620
他妈的 停火!
Stop shootin', goddamn it!

1661
02:14:54,421 --> 02:14:55,756
姜戈!
Django!

1662
02:14:55,922 --> 02:14:57,174
搞毛啊?
What?

1663
02:15:00,385 --> 02:15:02,012
我们抓到你女人了!
We got your woman!

1664
02:15:03,430 --> 02:15:05,932
比利·克劳什拿枪顶着她脑袋呢
Billy Crash here got his pistol upside her head.

1665
02:15:06,099 --> 02:15:08,685
你不给我现身投降的话
You don't stop all that carrying on,

1666
02:15:08,852 --> 02:15:11,897
到时候打爆她的头
he gonna blow her goddamn brains out.

1667
02:15:12,063 --> 02:15:16,026
我说出来不是吓吓人 牛仔 我说到做到
And that ain't no threat, horse boy. That there is a promise.

1668
02:15:17,652 --> 02:15:18,862
或者..
Or...

1669
02:15:19,029 --> 02:15:22,032
你投降 把枪扔出来...
you can give up, throw your gun out...

1670
02:15:23,158 --> 02:15:25,327
- 我们保证不杀希尔迪  - 屁话!
- we won't kill Hildi.  - Horseshit!

1671
02:15:25,494 --> 02:15:29,206
我说真的 姜戈 我对天发誓
Honest lnjun, Django. I swear 'fore God.

1672
02:15:30,290 --> 02:15:34,920
你缴械 我们不会伤害她的
You give up, ain't no harm gonna come to her.

1673
02:15:36,379 --> 02:15:38,799
我难道平白无故相信你个黑鬼说的话啦?
And I'm supposed to believe your black ass?

1674
02:15:38,965 --> 02:15:41,676
要我说 我可不管你信不信
Personally, I don't give a good goddamn what you believe or don't believe!

1675
02:15:41,843 --> 02:15:44,888
我相信 你要是十秒钟内不投降
I believe if you don't give up in the next ten seconds,

1676
02:15:45,055 --> 02:15:48,934
就要这婊子脑袋开花! 信不信由你!
we gonna blow this bitch's brains out! Believe that!

1677
02:15:51,186 --> 02:15:54,940
别这样 你别管我
Don't do it. You give me up.

1678
02:15:55,106 --> 02:15:56,942
- 六!  - 随我去好了
- Six!  - Just let me go.

1679
02:15:57,108 --> 02:15:58,652
- 七!  - 他们人太多了
- Seven!  - They got too much.

1680
02:15:58,819 --> 02:16:00,403
- 姜戈  - 八了!
- Django.  - Eight!

1681
02:16:00,570 --> 02:16:03,073
- 我爱你  - 九!
- I love you.  - Nine!

1682
02:16:03,240 --> 02:16:05,325
- 等一下!  - 不
- Hold it!  - No.

1683
02:16:07,327 --> 02:16:08,411
我缴械投降
I give up.

1684
02:16:09,621 --> 02:16:12,374
我听不见你说什么 黑鬼
I can't hear you, nigger.

1685
02:16:12,541 --> 02:16:15,043
我说 我缴械投降
I said I give up!

1686
02:16:38,149 --> 02:16:40,694
不啊!
No! 

1687
02:16:41,862 --> 02:16:43,321
不要啊!
No!

1688
02:18:14,579 --> 02:18:17,165
太阳上山 该起床了 黑鬼
Cock-a-doodle-do, nigger.

1689
02:18:22,462 --> 02:18:24,589
你是个赏金猎人咯?
So y'all bounty hunters, huh?

1690
02:18:25,548 --> 02:18:28,301
我就知道你们有什么不可告人的秘密
I knew there was something fishy about y'all.

1691
02:18:29,302 --> 02:18:31,513
我们在你的鞍囊里...
We found your wanted posters...

1692
02:18:32,097 --> 02:18:34,307
找到了你们的悬赏令和记账本
and book of figures in your saddlebags.

1693
02:18:35,725 --> 02:18:37,352
但我不得不说...
I got to say...

1694
02:18:38,061 --> 02:18:41,356
我之前从来没听说黑人做赏金猎人的
I ain't never heard of no black bounty hunter before.

1695
02:18:41,523 --> 02:18:44,567
黑人收钱杀白人? 这个怎么合逻辑呢?
Black boy paid to kill white men? How'd you like that line of work?

1696
02:18:45,610 --> 02:18:48,238
好像你们做得还不错的样子啊?
Probably pretty good while it lasted, huh?

1697
02:18:57,706 --> 02:18:59,541
跟蛋蛋说拜拜吧 黑仔
Time to say good night to them nuts, blackie.

1698
02:18:59,708 --> 02:19:02,377
数到三啊 一...
On three. One...

1699
02:19:02,544 --> 02:19:05,422
我刀快 二...
I got you. Two...

1700
02:19:05,588 --> 02:19:08,800
冷静点 就一下啊
Calm down, now, here it comes.

1701
02:19:08,967 --> 02:19:11,553
队长?
Captain?

1702
02:19:11,720 --> 02:19:13,471
劳拉小姐要见你
Miss Lara want to see you.

1703
02:19:14,305 --> 02:19:18,226
是说和老主人葬礼有关的事情
Something to do with the Old Man's funeral.

1704
02:19:18,393 --> 02:19:22,188
哦 另外她不想让姜戈挨那一刀了
Oh, and she changed her mind 'bout snipping Django.

1705
02:19:22,981 --> 02:19:25,817
她打算把他送给勒坎·迪奇的人
She gonna give him to the LeQuint Dickey people.

1706
02:19:27,652 --> 02:19:29,779
她的主意改得真是及时
Well, she didn't waste a minute telling me.

1707
02:19:37,037 --> 02:19:38,830
让人失望啊
How disappointing.

1708
02:20:01,770 --> 02:20:03,104
你走的话
You leavin'.

1709
02:20:04,773 --> 02:20:07,817
这些就是你随身带的了
This here what you take with you.

1710
02:20:11,196 --> 02:20:14,657
你个黑仔的一通乱打 让那群管事的人
Your black ass has been all them motherfuckers at The Big House

1711
02:20:14,824 --> 02:20:18,244
讨论了好些时候
could talk about for the last few hours.

1712
02:20:18,411 --> 02:20:22,123
好像那群白人就天生没什么好想法
Seem like white folk ain't never had a bright idea in they life

1713
02:20:22,290 --> 02:20:25,001
他们脑子里都是 把你杀了了事
was coming up with all kinds of ways to kill your ass.

1714
02:20:25,168 --> 02:20:30,465
说一句 他们脑子里想的 都是怎么处置你那玩意儿
Now, mind you, most of them ideas had to do with fuckin' with your fun parts.

1715
02:20:30,632 --> 02:20:36,179
这看上去是个好主意 不过实际上...
Now, that may seem like a good idea, but truth is...

1716
02:20:37,764 --> 02:20:40,016
当黑鬼被切了蛋蛋之后
when you snip a nigger's nuts,

1717
02:20:40,183 --> 02:20:44,395
大多数流血至死 哦.. 大概流7分钟的样子
most of them bleed out in, oh, about, hm... seven minutes.

1718
02:20:44,562 --> 02:20:46,147
大部分的人
Most of 'em.

1719
02:20:46,356 --> 02:20:49,526
好吧 绝大多数
Well, more than most.

1720
02:20:50,276 --> 02:20:56,116
所以我说 还不够狠
Then I says: "Shitfire.

1721
02:20:56,282 --> 02:21:00,286
我们卖给勒坎·迪奇的黑鬼比这惨多了
The niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that."

1722
02:21:01,329 --> 02:21:04,040
他们还说 我们鞭死他算了
And they still sayin', "Let's whip him to death."

1723
02:21:04,207 --> 02:21:07,502
或者 让他跟曼丁哥打一架 把他喂斯通塞弗家的狗
Or "Throw him to the Mandingos." "Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs."

1724
02:21:07,669 --> 02:21:10,880
我说 这有什么特别的呢?
And I said, "What's so special about that?

1725
02:21:11,047 --> 02:21:13,174
这事我们不是常做吗
We do that shit all the time.

1726
02:21:13,341 --> 02:21:19,222
见了个鬼了 我们卖给勒坎·迪奇的黑鬼比这可苦多了
Hell's bells, the niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that."

1727
02:21:20,348 --> 02:21:23,059
你瞧
Lo and behold,

1728
02:21:23,226 --> 02:21:28,064
突然间 劳拉小姐想出了一个绝妙的点子
out of nowhere, Miss Lara come up with the bright idea

1729
02:21:28,231 --> 02:21:31,693
把你卖给勒坎·迪奇矿场
of giving your ass to the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.

1730
02:21:34,070 --> 02:21:39,200
直到你死的那一天
And as a slave of the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company,

1731
02:21:39,367 --> 02:21:42,912
你都是勒坎·迪奇矿场的奴隶
henceforth, till the day you die,

1732
02:21:43,079 --> 02:21:46,207
你会一直 每天
all day, every day,

1733
02:21:46,374 --> 02:21:49,210
挥着长柄大锤
you will be swinging a sledgehammer,

1734
02:21:49,377 --> 02:21:54,007
把大石头敲成小石头
turning big rocks into little rocks.

1735
02:21:54,174 --> 02:21:58,761
当你到那边的时候 你不会再有名字
Now, when you get there, they gonna take away your name,

1736
02:21:58,928 --> 02:22:01,848
取而代之的是 工作号码和一柄大锤
give you a number and a sledgehammer,

1737
02:22:02,015 --> 02:22:04,434
被叫嚣道 还不快去工作!
and say, "Get to work!"

1738
02:22:04,601 --> 02:22:07,020
顶一句嘴 他们就割了你的舌头
One word of sass, they cuts out your tongue.

1739
02:22:07,187 --> 02:22:09,522
而且他们手脚麻利 你都没机会流很多血
And they good at it too. You won't bleed out.

1740
02:22:09,689 --> 02:22:13,359
没错... 他们就是那么麻利
Oh... they does that real good.

1741
02:22:13,526 --> 02:22:15,111
他们就这么治你
They gonna work ya.

1742
02:22:15,278 --> 02:22:20,283
天天治 每天治 直到你的奄奄一息为止
All day, every day, till your back give out.

1743
02:22:20,450 --> 02:22:23,036
到那时候 他们用榔头敲碎你的脑袋
Then they're gonna hit you in the head with a hammer,

1744
02:22:23,203 --> 02:22:25,622
再把你扔进黑鬼洞了事
throw your ass down the nigger hole.

1745
02:22:25,788 --> 02:22:31,169
这就是你之后的人生 姜戈
And that will be the story of you, Django.

1746
02:22:34,788 --> 02:22:37,169
去勒坎·迪奇矿场的路上

1747
02:23:10,208 --> 02:23:12,669
记住原则 弗兰奇?
And what's the golden rule, Frankie, eh?

1748
02:23:12,835 --> 02:23:14,963
别理那些黑鬼
You don't root abos.

1749
02:23:19,717 --> 02:23:21,177
嘿 白人小伙
Hey, white boy.

1750
02:23:22,720 --> 02:23:24,889
我说你呢 嘿 白人小伙
I said, hey, white boy.

1751
02:23:25,056 --> 02:23:28,142
闭嘴 黑仔 你的话我不感兴趣
Shut up, black. You ain't got nothing to say I want to hear.

1752
02:23:28,309 --> 02:23:30,603
你想赚11000美金吗?
How'd you like to make $11,000?

1753
02:23:30,770 --> 02:23:31,938
赚什么?
Do what, now?

1754
02:23:32,105 --> 02:23:37,902
我说 你想赚11000美金吗? 准确的说 11500美金
I said how'd you like to make $11,000? 11,500, actually.

1755
02:23:38,069 --> 02:23:40,029
你他妈在说什么
What the fuck are you talking about?

1756
02:23:40,196 --> 02:23:44,867
在糖果农场种植园 藏着价值11500的宝藏
Back there at that plantation, Candyland, there was an $11,500 fortune,

1757
02:23:45,034 --> 02:23:47,870
就在那里 而你们刚刚与它失之交臂
just sittin' there. And y'all rode right past it.

1758
02:23:48,830 --> 02:23:50,540
你个疯子 黑鬼 我们可不是强盗
You be damned, blackie, we're not bandits.

1759
02:23:50,707 --> 02:23:54,919
我可没这么说 这宝藏好就好在 拿它不犯法
I ain't saying that. Nice thing about this fortune is it ain't illegal.

1760
02:23:55,086 --> 02:23:56,504
你不是去偷
You can't steal it.

1761
02:23:56,671 --> 02:23:58,339
你是要去争取 白人小哥
You got to earn it, white boy.

1762
02:23:59,299 --> 02:24:01,301
你有什么要说的 开天窗说亮话
You got something to say, mate, you say it.

1763
02:24:01,467 --> 02:24:04,679
糖果农场里的11500美金宝藏
The $11,500 fortune waitin' for you back at Candyland

1764
02:24:04,846 --> 02:24:06,973
是捉拿斯密·巴考尔和他的团伙的赏金
is in the form of a "Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty

1765
02:24:07,140 --> 02:24:09,475
生死不论
on Smitty Bacall and the Bacall Gang.

1766
02:24:09,642 --> 02:24:11,102
谁他妈是斯密·巴考尔啊?
Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?

1767
02:24:11,269 --> 02:24:14,564
斯密·巴考尔是一群马车劫匪的头子 专干杀人越货的勾当
Smitty Bacall is the leader of this murderous gang of stagecoach robbers,

1768
02:24:14,731 --> 02:24:16,316
人称巴考尔帮
the Bacall Gang.

1769
02:24:16,482 --> 02:24:19,736
活捉或生杀斯密·巴考尔的赏金是7000美金
There's a $7,000 "Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty on him,

1770
02:24:19,902 --> 02:24:23,239
他的另外三个同伙 丹迪·迈克尔斯
$1,500 for each of his three accomplices:

Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash,

1772
02:24:26,826 --> 02:24:29,537
各值1500美金
and Crazy Craig Koons.

1773
02:24:29,704 --> 02:24:31,122
他们四个人现在
Now, all four of them gentlemen,

1774
02:24:31,289 --> 02:24:33,416
在糖果农场开心得不得了
they back there at Candyland laughing their ass off.

1775
02:24:33,583 --> 02:24:37,253
你知道为什么吗? 因为他们刚刚逃过一劫
You know why? 'Cause they just got away with murder.

1776
02:24:37,420 --> 02:24:38,963
但他们不会得意太久
But it ain't got to be that way.

1777
02:24:39,130 --> 02:24:42,425
你和你的伙计们 可以杀个回马枪 把那钱给赚了
You and your mates, y'all can ride back there and y'all can go get that money.

1778
02:24:42,592 --> 02:24:43,676
他们到底做了什么事情?
What'd these jokers do again?

1779
02:24:43,843 --> 02:24:47,347
那群混蛋 他们杀无辜的人
These sons of bitches, they killed innocent people.

1780
02:24:47,513 --> 02:24:50,767
抢劫马车 专杀无辜的白人
Stagecoach robbery. Innocent white people.

1781
02:24:51,851 --> 02:24:54,854
我袋子里就有通缉令 我拿给你看
I got the handbill right here in my pocket, if you let me get it.

1782
02:24:55,021 --> 02:24:56,189
拿出来
Get it out.

1783
02:24:57,940 --> 02:25:03,196
悬赏 生死不论 斯密·巴考尔以及斯密·巴考尔帮
"Wanted. Dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang."

1784
02:25:03,363 --> 02:25:04,697
- 但就你个奴隶  - "因其犯下杀人..."
- But you're a slave.  - "For murder..."

1785
02:25:04,864 --> 02:25:07,367
- 我才他妈不是奴隶  - "抢劫马车"
- I ain't no goddamn slave.  - "...and stagecoach robbery."

1786
02:25:07,533 --> 02:25:08,785
我说话他妈地像是个奴隶吗?
Do I sound like a fuckin' slave?

1787
02:25:09,118 --> 02:25:10,578
- "斯密·巴考尔悬红7000美金"  - 嗯?
- "$7,000 for Smitty Bacall."  - Hm?

1788
02:25:10,745 --> 02:25:13,539
- 还真值钱啊  - 我是个赏金猎人
- That's a shitload.  - I'm a bounty hunter.

1789
02:25:14,957 --> 02:25:17,543
昨天 我还是自由之身
Yesterday, as a free man,

1790
02:25:17,710 --> 02:25:22,256
我和我德国的白人搭档金·舒尔茨博士
I rode into Candyland on a horse with my German white partner,

1791
02:25:22,423 --> 02:25:23,966
骑马进了糖果农场
Dr. King Schultz.

1792
02:25:24,133 --> 02:25:28,888
我们从德州一路追查巴考尔帮到奇克索县
We tracked the Bacall Gang all the way from Texas to Chickasaw County.

1793
02:25:29,055 --> 02:25:31,974
我们终于发现那群混蛋在糖果农场隐姓埋名
We finally found their ass layin' low in Candyland.

1794
02:25:32,141 --> 02:25:35,645
他们杀进去要取他们首级 但事与愿违
We went in there to get 'em, things went sour,

1795
02:25:35,812 --> 02:25:39,148
我搭档被杀 卡尔文·坎迪被打死
my partner got killed, Calvin Candie got shot,

1796
02:25:39,315 --> 02:25:43,486
那里的人把怒气都发在我身上 所以我就落到了现在这下场
then everybody there decided to blame me, so here I am.

1797
02:25:45,488 --> 02:25:47,407
但你们知道 我是被冤枉的
But y'all know I ain't on that manifest.

1798
02:25:47,573 --> 02:25:50,368
你们都知道 我不应该走这趟的
And all y'all know I ain't supposed to be on this trip.

1799
02:25:50,535 --> 02:25:53,871
但那边的四个人 他们仍被通缉中
But them four men is still back there, they're still wanted,

1800
02:25:54,038 --> 02:25:57,333
11500赏金唾手可得 他们肯定想不到
and that 11,500 is up for grabs, and the last thing they'd expect

1801
02:25:57,500 --> 02:25:59,752
你们会杀个回马枪 去取赏金
is y'all ridin' back in there and gettin' it.

1802
02:25:59,919 --> 02:26:01,671
到底怎么说?
What's the deal?

1803
02:26:01,838 --> 02:26:05,299
你告诉我他们是谁 我放你走?
You tell us who they are and we turn you loose?

1804
02:26:05,466 --> 02:26:08,344
不行 不行 我不会告诉你他们是谁
No, no, no, no. I ain't gonna tell you who they are.

1805
02:26:08,511 --> 02:26:12,014
但你给我把手枪 一匹马
But, you give me a pistol, one of them horses,

1806
02:26:12,181 --> 02:26:16,686
11500美金里面的500块 我就指给你们看
and $500 of that 11,500, and I'll point 'em out to you.

1807
02:26:16,853 --> 02:26:18,729
这通缉令是真的
This is a real handbill.

1808
02:26:18,896 --> 02:26:19,939
就算这是真的通缉令
Now just 'cause it's a real handbill

1809
02:26:20,106 --> 02:26:22,191
也不代表刚才那顿叽里呱啦是真的
doesn't mean that other bunch of malarkey is.

1810
02:26:22,358 --> 02:26:28,281
为什么奴隶身上会有"死活不论"通缉令呢?
Now why would a slave have a "Wanted Dead or Alive" handbill in his pocket?

1811
02:26:32,952 --> 02:26:35,746
那黑仔昨天才到糖果农场的吗?
Did that black ride into Candyland yesterday?

1812
02:26:42,086 --> 02:26:46,048
好吧 我再问一遍
All right, I'm gonna ask you again.

1813
02:26:47,258 --> 02:26:49,886
我要你们记好了 我可不喜欢骗子啊
I want you to remember, I don't like liars.

1814
02:26:50,595 --> 02:26:52,430
他是不是糖果庄园的奴隶
Is he a Candyland slave,

1815
02:26:52,597 --> 02:26:56,392
还是他跟一个白人骑马路过的?
or did he ride in with a white man on a horse yesterday?

1816
02:26:56,559 --> 02:27:00,229
是的 他们他和一个白人骑马
Yeah. They walked us from the Greenville auction,

1817
02:27:00,396 --> 02:27:02,940
从格林维尔拍卖行路过
and he rode in on a horse with a white man.

1818
02:27:03,608 --> 02:27:07,778
那个黑人是那白人的奴隶吗?
Now this white man, was the black his slave?

1819
02:27:07,945 --> 02:27:09,447
他才不是什么奴隶
He weren't no slave.

1820
02:27:09,614 --> 02:27:13,451
- 你他妈确定吗?  - 太他妈确定了
- You fuckin' sure about that?  - Damn sure.

1821
02:27:17,413 --> 02:27:20,958
- 糖果农场到底发生了什么?  - 一堆乱射
- What happened over in Candyland?  - Bunch-a shootin'.

1822
02:27:21,125 --> 02:27:22,919
到处都在开枪
Massa got shot.

1823
02:27:23,085 --> 02:27:25,213
- 谁打了他?  - 那个德国人
- Who shot him?  - The German.

1824
02:27:25,379 --> 02:27:26,422
他为什么这么做?
Why'd he do that?

1825
02:27:27,089 --> 02:27:30,551
那黑鬼和那德国人伪装成奴隶贩子 但他们不是
Nigger and the German was actin' like they were slavers but they wasn't.

1826
02:27:30,718 --> 02:27:33,804
- 那他们到底是干什么的?  - 赏金猎人
- Well, what were they?  - Bounty hunters.

1827
02:27:34,889 --> 02:27:38,226
我操 罗伊 我感觉这次大大的有戏 伙计
