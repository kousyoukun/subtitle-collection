00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,370
被解放的姜戈

9
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,300
1858年  美国内战两年前

10
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,350
德克萨斯州某处

11
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,590
是谁在那里鬼鬼祟祟的
Who's that stumblin' around in the dark?

12
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,800
不想吃枪子的话就赶紧报上姓名
State your business, or prepare to get winged!

13
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,600
先生们勿冲动  我并无恶意
Calm yourselves gentlemen, I mean you no harm.

14
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,170
我也只是名疲倦的旅者
I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.

15
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,320
寒冷的晚上好  先生们
Good cold evening gentlemen,

16
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,970
我正在找一对
I'm looking for a pair of slave traders

17
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,730
名叫斯派克兄弟的奴隶商人
that go by the name of the Speck Brothers.

18
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,610
是您们二位吗
Might that be you?

19
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,160
是谁要找
Who wants to know?

20
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,710
正是本人
Well, I do.

21
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,630
我是金・舒尔茨医生  这是我的马  弗里茨
I'm Dr. King Schultz, this is my horse, Fritz.

22
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,250
你是什么医生
What kinda doctor?

23
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,690
牙医
Dentist.

24
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,480
所以  你们就是斯派克兄弟
Now are you the Speck Brothers,

25
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,290
他们是你们在格林维尔的奴隶拍卖会上买的吗
and did you purchase those men at the Greenville slave auction?

26
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,230
是又如何
So what?

27
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,320
我想与你们谈判
So what... I wish to parley with you.

28
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,420
说人话
Speak English.

29
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,430
抱歉
Oh, I'm sorry.

30
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,030
请见谅  英语是我的第二语言
Please forgive me, it is a second language.

31
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,650
我相信您的这些货物里面
Now, amongst your inventory, I've been led to believe,

32
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,700
有我想要找的人
is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.

33
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,180
你们好  可怜鬼们
Hello you poor devils!

34
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,240
你们有人
Is there one amongst you,

35
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,510
曾经在克鲁根种植园工作吗
who was formerly a resident of The Carrucan Plantation?

36
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,810
我是从克鲁根种植园来的
I'm from The Carrucan Plantation.

37
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,320
刚才是谁说的
Who said that?

38
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,990
你叫什么
What's your name?

39
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,510
姜戈
Django.

40
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,700
那么我要找的就是你了
Then you're exactly the one I'm looking for.

41
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,720
你认识布里托三兄弟吗
Do you know who the Brittle Brothers are?

42
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,180
说说看都是谁
Who are they?

43
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,730
大块头约翰
Big John...

44
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,020
埃利斯
Ellis...

45
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,630
还有罗杰  有时人们也叫他小罗杰
and Raja... sometime they call him Lit'le Raj.

46
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,260
他们是克鲁根种植园的监工
They was overseers at Carrucan Plantation.

47
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,590
现在不是了
Not anymore.

48
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,970
告诉我
Tell me...

49
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,980
你如果再见到这三个人
If you were to see any of these three gentlemen again,

50
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,390
还能认出他们来吗
would you recognize them?

51
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,590
别那样问他们话
Stop talk with 'em like that.

52
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:06,930
怎样
Like what?

53
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,160
就像那样
Like that!

54
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,110
朋友们  我只是想查明
My good man, I'm simply trying to ascertain

55
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,770
说人话  该死的
Speak English, goddammit!

56
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,180
大家都消消火
Everybody calm down,

57
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:19,200
我不过是个想跟你们做交易的顾客
I'm simply a customer trying to conduct a transaction.

58
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,070
我管你呢  这些不卖
I don't care. No sale.

59
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,130
快滚吧
Now off wit' you!

60
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:25,560
讲点道理  他们当然是拿来卖的
Oh, don't be ridiculous, o'course they're for sale.

61
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,290
快滚开
Move it.

62
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,550
朋友
My good man,

63
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,780
你是只做做样子
did you simply get carried away with your dramatic gesture,

64
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,720
还是真想把我杀了
or are you pointing your weapon at me with lethal intention?

65
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,930
最后一次机会  娘娘腔
Last chance, fancy pants.

66
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,820
既然如此
Oh, very well...

67
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,510
真是抱歉不得不对着你的马开枪
I'm sorry to have put a bullet in your beast,

68
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,650
但我不想让你在搞清楚状况之前
but I didn't want you to do anything rash

69
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,220
就鲁莽行事
before you had a moment to come to your senses.

70
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,310
狗娘养的
Goddamn son of a bitch!

71
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,610
你打了罗斯科
You shot Roscoe!

72
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,010
还杀了爱死
And you killed Ace!

73
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,270
你哥哥威胁说要毙了我我才开枪的
Hey, I only shot your brother once he threatened to shoot me.

74
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,330
我确信这里有
And I do believe I have

75
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,790
1  2  3  4
one, two, three, four,

76
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:36,610
5个目击者可以作证
five witnesses who can attest to that fact.

77
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,460
腿他妈快骨折了
Damn legs busted!

78
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,970
这是肯定的
No doubt. Now, if you can

79
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,320
现在请你尽量小声点叫唤
keep your caterwauling down to a minimum,

80
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,400
我还想继续把要问姜戈的问题问完
I'd like to finish my line of inquiry with young Django.

81
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,650
我靠
God fucking dammit!

82
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,260
我再问一遍
As I was saying,

83
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,770
如果再见到布里托三兄弟
if you were to see the Brittle Brothers again,

84
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,120
你能认出来吗
you could recognize them?

85
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,920
可以
Yeah.

86
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,940
成交了  斯派克先生
Sold American! So Mr. Speck,

87
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,940
斯派克先生  姜戈卖多少钱
Mr. Speck, how much for young Django here?

88
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,660
这块铁真是碍事
That iron is nasty business.

89
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,620
你能先帮我拿着这个吗
Could you hold this for a moment?

90
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,410
谢谢你  姜戈  去骑那匹马吧
Thank you. Django, get up on that horse.

91
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,670
换作我  我会过去穿上
Also if I were you, I'd take that

92
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,250
死掉的斯派克留下的棉衣
winter coat the dear departed Speck left behind.

93
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,730
黑鬼  别碰我哥哥的衣服
Nigger, don't you touch my brother's coat!

94
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,360
我靠
Goddammit!

95
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,490
一百  零一十
One hundred... ten...

96
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,830
零二十  五
twenty... and five...

97
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,080
用来买姜戈的
for young Django here.

98
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,640
另外既然你们用不着了
And since you won't be needing it anymore,

99
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,990
我还要买走你哥哥的小马
I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.

100
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:27,440
以及  斯派克先生  我恐怕需要一张收据
Also... Mr. Speck, I am afraid I will require a bill of sale.

101
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,940
你们有吗
Do you have one?

102
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,790
去死吧  牙医
You go to hell, dentist!

103
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,190
我就知道没有
I thought not.

104
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,420
别担心
No worries!

105
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,070
我可是有备而来
I come prepared.

106
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,240
多谢
Thank you.

107
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,400
这个当收据应该不错
This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.

108
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,420
至于你们这些可怜鬼们
Now as to you poor devils...

109
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,180
接下来该怎么办  依我看来
So as I see it, when it comes to the subject of what to do next,

110
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,320
你们有两个选择
you gentlemen have two choices.

111
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,950
可以等我走了
once I'm gone,

112
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:22,620
你们可以把那匹马从活着的斯派克身上搬开
you could lift that beast off the remaining Speck,

113
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,530
然后他去最近的小镇
then carry him to the nearest town.

114
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,270
从来时的方向返回至少还有37里路
Which would be at least thirty-seven miles back the way you came.

115
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,600
或者你们可以选择把脚扣解开
You could unshackle yourselves...

116
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,490
用那把来福枪给他的脑袋来上一发
take that rifle, put a bullet in his head,

117
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,150
把他们两个好好埋了
bury the two of them deep,

118
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,340
然后逃向
and then make your way

119
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,560
这个国家更加开化的地方
to a more enlightened area of this country.

120
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,820
选择权在你们手上
The choice is yours.

121
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,530
对了  说不定你们之中
Oh, and on the off chance

122
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,670
有天文爱好者
there are any astronomy aficionados amongst you,

123
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,360
北极星是那一颗
the North Star is that one.

124
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,040
再见了
Tata.

125
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,810
等一下小伙子们  我们来谈谈
Now wait a minute fellas, let's talk about this.

126
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,990
这种情况下你们可得明理
You gotta be reasonable on a situation like this.

127
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,770
我不是坏人  我只是老老实实干本分工作
I'm not a bad guy, look I'm just doing my job!

128
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,750
蓝莓小子
Blueberry,

129
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,230
我不是把最后一个苹果分给你了吗
didn't I give you my last apple?

130
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,540
我告诉你们  把我带去
Tell you what boys, take me to

131
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,650
埃尔帕索找个医生  我就放你们自由
Lit'le Duck in El Paso, I'll get you your freedom.

132
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,620
不  不  求你们了
No. No, please...

133
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:58,160
德克萨斯  多特里

134
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,760
好了
Right now,

135
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,790
今晚吃两片
I'd like you take two of these tonight,

136
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,120
明天早上
and then in the morning...

137
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,620
那个骑在马上的是黑人吗
Is that a nigger on the horse?

138
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,060
大家都在看什么
What's everybody staring at?

139
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,170
他们从来没见过黑人骑在马上
They never seen a nigger on a horse before.

140
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,880
早上好  老板
Good morning inn keeper!

141
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,700
给两个疲倦的旅人来两杯啤酒吧
Two beers for two weary travelers.

142
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,990
现在还早了点
Ah, it's still a bit early.

143
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,220
我们一个小时之后才开始营业
We won't be open for another hour.

144
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,630
到那时才开始供应早餐
By then we'll be servin' breakfast.

145
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,720
你他妈在想什么呢  小子
What the hell you think you doin', boy?

146
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,080
把那个黑鬼赶出去
Get that nigger outta here.

147
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,970
救命  救命
Help! Help!

148
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,240
老板
Inn keeper!

149
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,850
记住去找警长  别找治安官
Remember, get the sheriff, not the marshall.

150
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:06,390
现在我们得自己倒酒喝了
Now we must act as our own bartender.

151
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,010
坐吧  孩子
Sit down, my boy.

152
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,330
你是哪门子牙医
What kinda dentist are you?

153
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,120
别看我有辆牙医车  我已经五年不做牙医了
Despite that cart, I haven't practiced dentistry in five years.

154
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,740
现在我找了份新工作
These days I practice a new profession.

155
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,440
赏金猎人
Bounty Hunter.

156
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,410
你知道赏金猎人是干什么的吗
D'you know what a Bounty Hunter is?

157
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,710
不知道
No.

158
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,670
奴隶交易是用活人换取现金
The way the slave trade deals in human lives for cash,

159
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,030
而赏金猎人是用尸体做交易
a bounty hunter deals in corpses.

160
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,780
干杯
Prost.

161
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,960
州政府悬赏一个人的人头
The state places a bounty on a man's head,

162
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:21,300
我追踪到那个人  找到他  把他杀了
I track that man, I find that man, I kill that man,

163
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,710
杀了他之后
after I've killed him,

164
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,640
把他的尸体运送回当局
I transport that man's corpse back to the authorities,

165
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,860
有时候做起来没说的那么简单
and sometimes that's easier said then done,

166
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:30,760
我把尸体给当局  证明没错
I show that corpse to the authorities proving, yes indeed,

167
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,290
我的确杀了他
I truly have killed him,

168
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,390
然后他们就会把赏金付给我
at which point the authorities pay me the bounty.

169
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:39,690
就跟奴隶买卖一样  用人换钱的交易
So... like slavery, it's a flesh-for-cash business.

170
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,480
什么是赏金
What's a bounty?

171
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,530
就好比是报酬
It's like a reward.

172
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,820
你杀了人然后他们还给你报酬
You kill people and they give you a reward?

173
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,910
特定的人
Certain people, yeah.

174
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,010
坏人吗
Bad people?

175
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,270
没错
Aah!

176
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,330
人越坏  赏金就越高
Badder they are, bigger the reward!

177
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,960
所以我找到了你
Which brings me to you.

178
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,960
我得承认
And I must admit that I'm

179
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,030
对于你我也有一点为难
at a bit of a quandary when it comes to you.

180
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,440
一方面  我鄙视奴隶制
On one hand, I despise slavery.

181
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,520
另一方面
On the other hand...

182
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,480
我又需要你帮忙
I need your help,

183
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,840
如果你不拒绝的话  那就最好了
if you're not in a position to refuse, all the better.

184
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,740
所以这段时间
So for the time being,

185
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,600
我要好好利用这鬼扯的奴隶制
I'm gonna make this slave malarkey work to my benefit.

186
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,470
不过  我还是觉得
Still... having said that...

187
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,860
自己很愧疚
I feel guilty.

188
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,250
所以
So...

189
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,390
我希望我们两个能做个约定
I would like the two of us to enter into an agreement.

190
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,840
我正在找布里托三兄弟
I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.

191
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,650
虽然之前也做了很多努力
However I've had this endeavor,

192
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,620
但我仍然有个小小的劣势
I'm- I'm at a slight disadvantage,

193
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,040
到目前为止  我不知道他们长什么样
in so far as, I don't know what they look like.

194
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,230
但你知道  是吧
But you do... don't you?

195
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,860
没错  我知道他们长什么样
I know what they look like, all right.

196
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,690
很好
Good.

197
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,900
所以约定就是这样
So here's my agreement.

198
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,870
你跟着我走  找到他们
You travel with me until we find them

199
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,950
我们往哪走
Where we goin'?

200
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,880
我听闻他们至少有两个人
I hear at least two of them are

201
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,210
在加特林堡做监工  但不知道具体哪里
overseeing up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.

202
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,960
那就意味着我们得拜访加特林堡的每个种植园
That means we visit every

203
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,920
直到找到他们
plantation in Gatlinburg till we find them.

204
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,590
一旦找到他们
And when we find them...

205
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,830
你帮我指认  我去杀了他们
you point them out, and I kill them!

206
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,710
你照做的话  我就同意还你自由
You do that, I agree to give you your freedom,

207
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,250
每个布里托兄弟
twenty-five dollars per

208
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,080
给你25块钱  总共75块
Brittle brother. That's seventy-five dollars,

209
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,280
不出所料  警长来了
and as if on cue, here comes the sheriff.

210
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,810
好了小子们  闹够了吧
Okay boys, fun's over.

211
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,690
给我出来
Come on out.

212
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,250
大家都不用惊慌
All right folks, calm down.

213
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,880
回去做自己的事情吧
You bout your business.

214
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,050
小丑们马上就会消失了
The jokers will be gone soon.

215
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,300
为什么你们要来我的地盘挑衅
why y'all wanna come into my town and start trouble,

216
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,720
恐吓这些良民
and... scare all these nice people?

217
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,840
除了跑到比尔・夏普的镇上
You ain't got nothin' better to do,

218
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,870
撒野以外
than to come into Bill Sharp's town

219
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,230
你们就没有其他事情能做了吗
and show your ass?

220
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,290
你对我们的警长做了什么
What did you jus' do to our sheriff?

221
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,380
现在可以去把治安官找来了
Now you can get the marshall.

222
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,260
治安官  治安官
Marshall, marshall!

223
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,740
我们非得进去等吗
Should we wait inside?

224
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,010
不能就这么直接走吗
Can't we just leave?

225
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,440
你先进
After you.

226
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:00,650
把那辆酒吧门口马车搬到对面去
Move that buckboard long ways 'cross the street from the saloon!

227
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
我要6个人带枪躲到后面
I want six men, six riffles behind it.

228
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,330
2个人带枪去这边的屋顶
I want two men, two rifles up on this roof,

229
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,990
再来2个人带枪去那边的屋顶
two men two rifles on that roof.

230
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,050
所有人都拿枪瞄准酒吧前门
All the barrels aimed at that front door.

231
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,990
谁来把可怜的比尔从这该死的街上弄走
Somebody git poor Bill outta the goddamn street.

232
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,450
酒吧里的人
You in the saloon!

233
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,280
现在外面有100把枪正瞄准着
We got a hundred riffles aimed on

234
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,350
这栋房子的各个角落
every way outta that buildin'!

235
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,130
你只有一个机会能活着出来
You got once chance git outta this alive!

236
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,350
那就是你和你的黑鬼立刻
You and your nigger come out right now

237
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,160
举起双手走出来
with your hands over your head,

238
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,340
再次强调  是立刻
and I mean, right now!

239
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,580
酒吧

240
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,730
我是有幸在和治安官说话吗
Is this the marshall I have the pleasure of addressing?

241
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,330
正是
Yes it is.

242
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,850
我是美国治安官吉尔・塔图姆
This is U.S. Marshall Gill Tatum.

243
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,190
太好了[德语]  治安官
That wunderbar, marshall.

244
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,290
我把所有的武器都放下了
I have relieved myself of all weapons,

245
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,440
而且完全按照您说的做
and just as you have instructed,

246
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,390
我准备好举起双手
I am ready to step outside,

247
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,400
走出去了
with my hands raised above my head.

248
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,670
我相信
I trust,

249
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,990
作为一名
as a representative of the criminal justice system

250
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,810
美国刑事司法系统的代表
of The United States of America,

251
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,640
您不会让我在上法庭之前
I shan't be shot down in the street,

252
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,830
就在这条街上被您或者是您的手下
by either you or your deputies,

253
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,470
乱枪打死吧
before I've had my day in court.

254
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,770
你是说像你对我们的警长做的一样吗
You mean like you did our sheriff?

255
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,270
在大街上把他像狗一样射杀了
Shot 'em down like a dog in the street!

256
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,670
没错  正是这个意思
Yes, that's exactly what I mean!

257
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,840
您能以执法者的名义向我承诺
Do I have your word as a lawman,

258
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,050
不会把像狗一样我杀死在大街吗
not to shoot me down like a dog in the street?

259
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:32,190
虽然我们都想看到这场面
Well, as much as we'd all enjoy seein' somethin' like that,

260
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,080
但我的镇子上大家都信守诺言
ain't nobody gonna cheat the hangman in my town.

261
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,750
那太好了  执法官  我们这就出来
Fair enough marshall, here we come!

262
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,330
外面的形势有点紧张
They're a little tense out there.

263
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,290
所以别做大动作  我跟他们谈判
So don't make any quick movements, and let me do the talking.

264
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,940
出来吧
Come ahead.

265
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,210
你身上没武器了吗
You unarmed?

266
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,590
当然
Yes indeed we are.

267
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,160
塔图姆治安官  我能向您和您的手下
Marshall Tatum, may I address you and your deputies,

268
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,610
以及整个多特里镇上的人
and apparently the entire town of Daughtrey,

269
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,140
说明一下刚才发生的事情吗
as to the incident that just occurred?

270
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,270
说吧
Go on.

271
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,160
我是金・舒尔茨医生
My name is Dr. King Schultz,

272
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:18,270
跟您一样  执法官  我也为法庭效力
and like yourself, marshall, I am a servant of the court.

273
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,410
死在地上的那个男人
The man lying dead in the dirt,

274
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,920
多特里镇上的好人们
who the good people of

275
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,220
选举出来的
Daughtrey saw fit to elect as their sheriff,

276
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,340
名叫比尔・夏普的警长
who went by the name of Bill Sharp,

277
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:29,550
实际上是个名叫维拉德・佩克的
is actually a wanted outlaw

278
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,830
被通缉的罪犯
by the name of Willard Peck,

279
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,580
他的人头值200美元
with a price on his head of two hundred dollars.

280
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,530
无论死活都是200美元
Now, that's two hundred dollars, dead or alive.

281
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,550
信口开河
The hell you say!

282
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:42,300
我知道这个消息让人很困惑
I'm aware this is probably disconcerting news.

283
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,840
但我敢打赌这人大概是两年前什么时候
But I'm willing to wager this man was elected sheriff

284
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,330
才被选为警长的吧
sometime in the past two years.

285
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,730
我知道这些是因为三年前
I know this because three years ago,

286
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:55,050
他在德克萨斯州拉伯克市
he was rustling cattle from the B.C.

287
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,680
的克里根养牛场偷过牛
Corrigan Cattle Company of Lubbock, Texas.

288
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,690
这张是我拿到的通缉令
Now this is a warrant,

289
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:03,040
由德克萨斯州奥斯汀巡回法庭
made out by circuit court

290
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,020
亨利・艾伦・劳德米尔克法官签署
Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin Texas.

291
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,250
您大可联系他
You're encouraged to wire him.

292
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,330
他会告诉你我是谁
He'll back up who I am,

293
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:14,350
以及你们亲爱的警长曾经是谁
and who your dear departed sheriff was.

294
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,170
换句话说  治安官先生
In other words marshall,

295
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,240
您欠了我200美金
you owe me two hundred dollars.

296
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,690
我了个去
I'll be damned.

297
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:07,740
搞定布里托三兄弟之后
After this Brittle business is behind us...

298
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,460
你就自由了
you'll be a free man.

299
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,850
带着一匹马  口袋里还有70块钱
With a horse, seventy five dollars in your back pocket.

300
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,710
之后有什么打算吗
What's your plan after that?

301
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,140
找到我老婆
Find my wife...

302
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,490
赎回她的自由
and buy her freedom.

303
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:27,920
姜戈
Django...

304
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,240
我都不知道你已经结婚了
I had no idea you were a married man.

305
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,350
奴隶们都相信婚姻吗
Do most slaves believe in marriage?

306
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,310
我和我老婆相信
Me and my wife do.

307
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,220
克鲁根的那些人不相信  所以我们
All men in Carrucan did't, and that's why we uh...

308
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,460
我们才想逃走
we run off.

309
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,170
姜戈
Django...

310
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,060
姜戈  姜戈
Django, Django...

311
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,680
好大的胆子啊  姜戈
You got sand, Django.

312
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,600
这小子好大的胆子
Boy's got sand.

313
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:58,840
我不需要胆大妄为的黑鬼
I got no use for niggers with sand.

314
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,600
给他脸上烙个逃跑者的标志R
I want you to burn the runaway "r" right here on his cheek.

315
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,490
那个女孩也烙上
And the girl too.

316
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,350
把他们带去格林维尔拍卖会
And I want you to take 'em to the Greenville auction,

317
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,190
卖掉
and sell 'em...

318
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,260
两个都卖掉
Both of 'em...

319
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,520
卖到不同地方
Separately.

320
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,220
这个小子
And this one...

321
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,570
卖便宜点
you will sell him cheap.

322
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,440
在格林维尔吗
In Greenville?

323
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,920
那里应该有专门做记录的部门
There should be some sort of a records office.

324
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,910
可以查到什么时候卖掉的
You know when she was sold...

325
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,830
来自哪里
you know where she came from...

326
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,850
还有名字
and you know her name.

327
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,120
她叫什么
What is her name?

328
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,830
布鲁姆希尔达
Broomhilda.

329
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,440
什么
What?

330
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,340
布鲁姆希尔达
Broom-hilda.

331
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,630
-布鲁姆希尔达  -没错
- Broomhilda? - Hm-hm.

332
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,570
她之前的主人是德国人吗
Were her owners German?

333
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,180
是的  你怎么知道的
Yeah, how you know?

334
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,700
她不是在克鲁根种植园出生的
She wan't born on The Carrucan Plantation,

335
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,160
是被一个德国女主人养大的
she was raised by a German mistress.

336
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,360
姓冯・夏福特
Von Shafts.

337
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,800
她也会一点点德语
She speak a little German too.

338
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,040
-你妻子吗  -没错
- Your wife? - Hm-hm.

339
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,820
她还小的时候
When she was little,

340
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,010
女主人教了她一点德语  好有人陪她说话
her mistress taught her so she has somebody speak German with.

341
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,510
等我缕缕清楚
Alright, let me get this straight.

342
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,430
你的奴隶老婆会说德语
Your slave wife speaks German,

343
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,960
而且名字还叫布鲁姆希尔达・冯・夏福特
and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?

344
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:29,900
是的
Yep.

345
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,010
他们叫我希尔迪
They call me Hildi.

346
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,790
田纳西州

347
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:56,970
我们去拜访这些种植园的时候
When we gain access to these plantations,

348
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,450
得当成是演戏
we'll be putting on an "Act".

349
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,300
你要扮演一个角色
You'll be playing a character.

350
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,380
不合适吗
No?

351
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,540
演戏期间  你可不能出戏
But during the act, you can never break character.

352
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,720
明白了吗
D'you understand?

353
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,830
明白了  不能出戏
Yeah. Don't break character.

354
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:36,890
你要扮演的角色就是我的男仆
And you character is that of the "Valet".

355
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,190
男仆是什么
What that is?

356
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,520
就是佣人的体面说法
That's a fancy word for servant.

357
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,490
男仆
"Valet".

358
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:49,970
姜戈  你现在可以选自己角色的戏服了
And now Django, you may chose your character's costume.

359
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,290
你要我自己选一套衣服吗
You want that I pick up my own clothes?

360
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,530
当然了
You- but of course!

361
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,110
在这片领地让黑鬼
It's against the law for

362
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,460
骑马是违法的
niggers to ride horses in this territory.

363
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,890
位是我的男仆  他从来不自己下地走
This is my valet, my valet does not walk.

364
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,620
我说了让黑鬼骑马
I said niggers on horses...

365
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,750
他叫姜戈  是个自由人
His name is Django, he's a free man,

366
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,040
他想骑什么就骑什么
he can ride what he pleases.

367
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,740
在我的地盘可不行
Not on my property.

368
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,680
在我家的黑人面前就不能骑
Not around my niggers he can't.

369
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,960
朋友
My good sir...

370
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,990
可能我们留下的第一印象不好
perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.

371
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,760
请允许我从头开始
Allow me to unring this bell.

372
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,160
我是金・舒尔茨医生
My name is Dr. King Schultz,

373
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,690
这位是我的男仆姜戈
this is my valet Django,

374
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:02,490
还有我们的马托尼和弗里茨
and these are our horses Tony and Fritz.

375
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,030
班尼特先生
Mr. Bennett,

376
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,180
我相信
I've been lead to believe

377
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,180
您是一位绅士  也是位生意人
that you are a gentleman, and a business man.

378
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:15,470
因此我们才从德克萨斯一路骑来田纳西
And it is for these attributes we've ridden from Texas

379
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,650
来跟您做交易
to Tennessee to parley with you now.

380
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,730
我想买您一个黑奴
I wish to purchase one of your nigger gals.

381
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,710
你和你的仆人从德克萨斯骑到田纳西
You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to Tennessee,

382
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,580
就为了买一个黑人奴隶
to buy one of my nigger gals?

383
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,690
没有预约  也不打个招呼
No appointment, no nuttin'?

384
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,500
恐怕是这样的
Oh, I'm afraid so.

385
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:36,500
如果我说我不喜欢你
Well what if I had to say I don't like you,

386
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,090
和你的娘娘腔黑鬼
or your fancy pants nigger,

387
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,170
另外我也什么都不会卖给你呢
and I wouldn't sell you a tinkers damn.

388
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,640
你觉得这样如何
Now what'cha gotta say about that?

389
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,180
班尼特先生
Mr. Bennett,

390
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:51,480
如果您是我想象中的那种生意人
if you are the business man I've been led to believe you to be,

391
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,530
我就有五千个理由
I have five thousand things,

392
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:56,280
可以让您改变主意
I might say, that could change your mind.

393
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:04,280
那就上来吧  我给你倒点喝的
Well com'on inside, and get yourself somethin' cool to drink.

394
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,850
也许我们谈生意的时候
Oh maybe, while we discuss business,

395
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,290
您可以找一个可爱的黑人女仆
you could provide one of your loveliest black creatures

396
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,220
带着姜戈去庄园里转转
to escort Django here around your magnificent grounds.

397
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,600
当然可以  贝特纳
Oh, absolutely! Eh, Betina!

398
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:29,670
什么事  老爹
Yessir, Big Daddy?

399
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:32,010
你的仆人叫什么来着
Eh... What's your Jimmie name again?

400
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,840
-姜戈  -姜戈
- Django. - Django.

401
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:36,520
贝特纳甜心  你能带那边的姜戈
Betina sugar, could you take Django there,

402
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:37,600
去外面转转
and take him around the grounds here

403
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,740
带他看看这里的好景色吗
to show him all the pretty stuff.

404
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,200
听您的吩咐  老爹
As you please, Big Daddy.

405
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,370
班尼特先生
Oh, Mr. Bennett,

406
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,370
我得提醒您姜戈是个自由人
I must remind you Django is a free man.

407
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:47,610
你们不能像奴隶一样对待他
He cannot be treated like a slave.

408
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,230
我相信你们这么有教养
Within the bounds of good taste,

409
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,350
一定会像对待我一样对待他
he must be treated as an extension of myself.

410
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,610
我明白  舒尔茨  贝特纳甜心
Understood, Schultz. Betina, sugar?

411
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:54,420
您请说
Yes, sir?

412
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,600
姜戈不是个奴隶
Django isn't a slave.

413
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:59,540
是个自由人  明白吗
Django is a free man. You understand?

414
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:03,190
你不能把他当作这里的其他黑人
You can't treat him like any of these other niggers around here,

415
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,270
他跟那些黑人
cause he ain't like any of

416
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,020
都不一样  懂了吗
these other niggers around here. Ya got it?

417
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:09,030
您是说让我把他当成白人看吗
You wan' I should treat him like white folks?

418
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,160
不是
No.

419
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,250
不是那个意思

镇上那个做玻璃的

423
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:24,070
白人小子叫什么来着

424
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,660
他妈妈在木材厂工作的那个

425
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,120
您是说杰里吗

《圣经》里这样讲

我喜欢你这样求我  小子
I like the way you beg, boy.

479
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,710
是你要找的人吗

489
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:54,280
《圣经・创世纪》9:2

490
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:54,280
神曾说凡地上的走兽
And the Lord said the fear of ye…

491
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,350
和空中的飞鸟
and the dread of ye…

492
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:59,900
都必惊恐  惧怕你们

还记得我吗
Remember me?

499
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:25,010
我喜欢你这样死掉  小子
I like the way you die, boy!

500
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:33,030
狗娘养的混蛋
Goddamn son-of-a-bitch!

501
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,590
你们想看点节目吗

00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:53,920

510
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,030
我不知道确信是什么意思
I don't know what positive means.

511
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,070
意思是肯定

515
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:19,910
姜戈
Django!

516
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:24,100
大家冷静一下
Everybody calm down,

517
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,490
我们无意伤害其他人
we mean no one else any harm.

518
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,290
你们两个是什么人
Who are you two jokers?

519
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,270
我是金・舒尔茨医生
I am Dr. King Schultz, a legal representative

520
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:34,670
美国刑事司法体系的一名法定代表
of the criminal justice system of the United States of America,

521
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,330
我左边这位是自由人姜戈  我的助手
the man to my left is Django Freeman, he's my deputy.

522
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,030
我口袋里有一份德州奥斯汀市
In my pocket is a warrant

523
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,530
巡回法庭法官亨利・艾伦・劳德米尔克
signed by circuit court

524
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,440
签署的委任状
judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin Texas,

525
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:50,120
奉命追捕约翰・布里托  罗杰・布里托和埃利斯・布里托
for the arrest and capture, dead or alive, of

526
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:54,590
活要见人死要见尸
John Brittle, Roger Brittle, and Ellis Brittle.

527
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,010
他们化名为夏弗
They've gone by the name Shaffer.

528
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,140
你知道夏弗吧
You know them by the name of Shaffer,

529
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,210
这3个屠夫的真名是布里托
but the butchers real name was Brittle.

530
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:05,980
就是我们要找的人  他们涉嫌谋杀
These are wanted men. The law wants them for murder.

531
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:10,390
我重复一遍  委任状说无论死活都行
Now I reiterate, the warrant states dead or alive,

532
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,700
所以自由人先生和我就将他们就地正法了
so when Mr. Freeman and myself executed these men on sight,

533
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:17,240
我们是依法行事
we were operating within our legal boundaries.

534
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,770
我注意到
I realize...

535
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:22,760
群情激昂
passions are high,

536
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:24,960
但我必须警告你
but I must warn you,

537
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:28,330
在法庭公务人员执法期间
the penalty for taking deadly force against a office of the court

538
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,380
阻碍其工作
in the performance of his duty is,

539
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,050
会被处以绞刑
you will be hung by the neck until you're dead.

540
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,280
我可以把委任状从口袋里拿出来  
May I please remove the

541
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,260
给你看看吗
warrant from my pocket so you may examine it?

542
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,950
拿来
Gimmie.

543
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,420
满意了吗
Satisfied?

544
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,900
请问我能拿回来了吗
May I have that back, please?

545
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,820
从我的地盘消失
Get off my land.

546
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:19,490
光速消失
Post haste.

547
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:23,650
赶紧把尸体收拾装车
Load up the bodies as quickly as you can,

548
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,530
走了
and let's get out of here.

549
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,790
见鬼
Hell...

550
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,390
那两个王八蛋在那里
That's 'em sonsabitches.

551
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:54,520
除非他们先开火  否则不准动手
Now unless they start shootin' first... nobody shoot 'em.

552
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:57,860
一枪打死太便宜他们了
That's way too simple for these jokers.

553
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:00,640
我们要抽死那个黑鬼控
We're gonna whip that nigger lover to death.

554
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:05,520
我要亲手剥下他们的衣服  修理他们
And I'm gonna personally strip and clip that garboon myself.

555
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:10,970
该死
Damn...

556
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,030
戴上这个  什么都看不到
I can't see fuckin' shit outta this thing.

557
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:17,190
准备好了吗
We ready, or what?

558
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:20,290
等一下   我找找眼洞
Ah hold on, I'm fuckin' with my eye holes.

559
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,530
我靠
Oh shit.

560
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,820
撕坏了
I just made it worse.

561
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,960
谁做的这鬼东西
Who made this goddamn shit?

562
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:27,970
维拉德老婆
Willard's wife.

563
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:29,990
不满意你自己做啊
Well make you own goddamn masks!

564
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:33,900
没人说不感谢詹尼
Look, nobody's sayin' they don't appreciate what Jenny did.

565
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:36,460
如果让我在头套上挖个洞
Well if all I hadda do was cut a hole in a bag,

566
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,430
肯定比这个做得好
I coulda cut it better than this.

567
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:40,910
罗伯特  你怎么样  看得到吗
How 'bout you Robert, can you see?

568
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:42,720
不太好
Not too good.

569
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,920
如果我头不动
I mean, if I don't move my head,

570
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,190
多少能看见点东西
I can see pretty good, more or less.

571
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,500
但是我一骑马
But when I start ridin',

572
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,940
这头套动来动去  我就成瞎子了
the bag's moving all over, and I'm ridin' blind.

573
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,380
该死
Oh shit!

574
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,420
我把我的也撕坏了
I just made mine worse.

575
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,980
还有多余头套吗
Anybody bring any extra bags?

576
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:02,150
没人带多余的头套
No, nobody brought an extra bag!

577
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:03,900
我就是问问
I'm just asking.

578
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:05,900
为什么骑马时要带这个
Do we hafta wear 'em when we ride?

579
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:07,530
蠢货
Oh well Shitfire!

580
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:09,270
如果骑马时不带这个
If you don't wear 'em as you ride up,

581
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:10,630
怎么体现我们是一伙的
that just defeats the purpose.

582
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:12,500
戴着这鬼东西  我什么都看不到
Well I can't see in this fucking thing!

583
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,110
气都喘不过来
I can't breathe in this fucking thing,

584
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:15,670
我骑马时没法戴
and I can't ride in this fucking thing!

585
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,720
滚你们的  老子不干了
Well fuck all y'all, I'm going home!

586
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,440
我看着我老婆干了一天  做了30个头套  
Ya know I watched my wife work all day

587
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:24,360
你们这群忘恩负义的混蛋还不领情
gettin' thirty bags to get ready for you ungrateful sonsabitches,

588
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:27,990
我听到的全是  抱怨抱怨抱怨
and all I hear is criticize, criticize, criticize.

589
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,680
从现在起  别找我或我家人做事
From now on, don't ask me or mine for nothin'!

590
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:33,870
都听好了
Now look...

591
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,760
别忘了我们为什么过来
Let's not forget why we're here.

592
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,590
我们要杀掉山那边的黑鬼
We gotta kill a nigger over that hill there.

593
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,590
要给他们点教训尝尝
And we gotta make a lesson outta 'em.

594
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,920
好吧  我不懂了
Okay, I'm confused.

595
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,740
头套还戴不戴了
Are the bags on or off.

596
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,680
我觉得  我们都觉得  头套还不错
I think... we all think... the bags was a nice idea.

597
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,710
-是啊  -是啊
C Yeah. C Yeah.

598
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:54,780
但我不是要发牢骚  它们可以做得更好一点
But not pointing 'ny fingers, they could have been done better.

599
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,030
所以  这次不戴头套怎么样
So how about... no bags this time,

600
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,350
但是下次把头套做好了 
but next time, we do the bags right,

601
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:04,780
我们就有完美标志了
and then we go full regalia.

602
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:06,940
我不戴了
I get my bag off.

603
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,160
等等
Wait a minute!

604
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:10,000
我没说不戴
I didn't say no bags.

605
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:12,350
戴了没人能看见路
But nobody can see.

606
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:13,770
所以呢
So?

607
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:16,060
还是能看见路比较好
So, it be nice to see.

608
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,540
笨蛋  这是袭击
Goddamit! This is a raid!

609
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:21,740
我看不到  你们看不到  又怎么样呢
I can't see, you can't see. So what?

610
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:24,310
重要的是马能看到
All that matters is can the fuckin' horse see!

611
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:25,790
这是一次袭击
That's a raid!

612
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:31,110
他在哪呢
Where's this shit!

613
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,280
找到了
There he is!

614
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,890
把黑鬼从马车底下拖出来
Get that nigger out from under 'at wagon.

615
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,440
把黑鬼控拖出来
And get that nigger lover out o'the wagon!

616
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,740
黑鬼不在
That nigger ain't down here!

617
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,920
-走了  -什么
C They're gone! C What?

618
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,680
-他把我们耍了  -他们在哪
C They tricked us! C Well where are they?

619
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,360
再会[德语]
Auf wiedersehen.

620
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:53,890
牛枪
Bull time.

621
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,600
我们把他们都毙了吧
We get 'em now.

622
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:04,460
懦夫才这么做
Cowards tend to do that.

623
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:14,670
该死
Goddammit!

624
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,010
想不想试试
Would you care to?

625
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:29,010
戴这鬼东西  什么都看不到
I can't see shit out of this...

626
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,870
他在逃跑呢
He's getting away.

627
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,800
我能行
I got 'em.

628
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:35,520
老爹在逃跑呢
Big Daddy's getting away.

629
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,120
我能行
I got 'em.

630
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,220
搞定
Got 'em.

631
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:00,810
对于新手来说  还不赖
For kids, ain't that short.

632
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,880
你怎么知道布鲁姆希尔达的第一任主人是德国人
How you know Broomhilda's first masters were German?

633
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:17,350
布鲁姆希尔达是德国姓
Broomhilda is a German name.

634
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:20,590
他们这样给她取名  就说明他们是德国人
If they named her, it stands to reason they'd be German.

635
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:23,280
你老家许多女孩叫布鲁姆希尔达吗
Lots of gals where you from named Broomhilda?

636
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:26,960
布鲁姆希尔达是最流行的德国传说中的
Broomhilda is the name of a character

637
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:30,580
角色的名字
in the most popular of all the German legends.

638
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:33,220
还有关于布鲁姆希尔达的故事吗
There's a story 'bout Broomhilda?

639
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:34,530
是的
Oh yes, there is.

640
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,460
你知道吗
Do you know it?

641
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:44,390
家喻户晓
Every German knows that story.

642
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:52,890
你想听吗
Would you like me to tell you?

643
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,260
好吧
Well...

644
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:59,680
布鲁姆希尔达是一位公主
Broomhilda was a... princess.

645
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:06,360
她是沃旦的女儿  诸神之神
She was the daughter of Wotan, the god of all gods.

646
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:10,110
可是  她父亲还是对她很生气
Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

647
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:11,770
她做了什么
What she do?

648
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:16,360
不太记得了  好像是哪里违背了他
I can't exactly remember. I think she disobeys him in some way.

649
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:20,360
他把她放在山顶上
So he puts her on top of the mountain.

650
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,170
布鲁姆希尔达在山顶上
Broomhilda's on a mountain?

651
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:23,150
这是德国传说
It's a German legend,

652
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,660
德国传说经常会出现山的
there's always going to be a mountain in there somewhere.

653
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:30,180
他还安排了一条喷火的龙守卫着山
And he puts a fire breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.

654
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:34,370
用一圈火焰
And he surrounds her...

655
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,660
围住她
in a circle of hellfire.

656
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:43,440
布鲁姆希尔达要一直待在那里
And there, Broomhilda shall remain,

657
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:49,170
除非有勇敢的英雄来救她
unless a hero arises brave enough to save her.

658
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,410
英雄来了吗
Does a fella arise?

659
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:55,340
来了  姜戈  事实上他来了
Yes Django. As a matter of fact, he does.

660
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:57,880
他叫西格弗里德
A fella named Sigfried.

661
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,140
西格弗里德救了她吗
Does Sigfried save her?

662
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:04,050
惊天动地
Quite spectacularly so.

663
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:09,770
他攀登上险峰  因为丝毫无惧
He scales the mountain, because he's not afraid of it.

664
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:13,840
他杀死了恶龙  因为心中无畏
He slays the dragon, because he's not afraid of him.

665
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:17,000
他赴汤蹈火
And he walks through hellfire...

666
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:21,670
因为布鲁姆希尔达值得他救
because Broomhilda's worth it.

667
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,370
我知道他的感受
I know how he feel.

668
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:31,790
我发觉我也才懂得
I think I'm just starting to realize that.

669
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:41,370
听着  姜戈
Now... Look... Django...

670
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:48,210
我丝毫不怀疑  有一天你会救回你的爱人
I don't doubt that one day you will save your lady love.

671
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:52,730
但是只要我还有理智  就不能让你去格林维尔
But I can't let you go to Greenville in a good conscious.

672
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:58,220
密西西比西部的华盛顿县  为纪念华盛顿总统成立于1827年

673
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:58,220
密西西比的华盛顿奴隶县不适合你去
Slave Washington, in Mississippi, isn't a place for you to visit.

674
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:00,920
无论你是不是自由人  这都太危险了
Free or not, it's just too dangerous.

675
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,780
我问你个问题
But let me ask you a question.

676
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:16,380
你觉得赏金猎人这活怎么样
How do you like the bounty hunting business?

677
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:20,090
杀白种人  还拿钱
Kill white folks, and they pay you for it?

678
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,440
为什么不喜欢
What's not to like?

679
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:25,100
我得承认  我们的组合非常好
And I have to admit, we make a good team.

680
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,130
我还以为你会怪我杀了大约翰和小罗杰
I thought you was mad at me for killin' Big John and Lit'le Raj?

681
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:30,420
那个时候  你确实有点冲动
Yeah, on that occasion, you were a tad overzealous,

682
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,040
但总的来说  合作愉快
but normally, that's a good thing.

683
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,620
你愿意这个冬天和我合作吗
How'd you like to partner up for the winter?

684
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:37,630
什么叫合作
What'd ya mean partner up?

685
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:41,820
你和我合作干完冬天  直到冰雪融化
You work with me through the winter till the snow melts.

686
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:45,570
我分你1/3赏金
I give you a third of my bounties.

687
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:50,210
我们这个冬天赚一笔  等雪一化
So we make some money this winter, and when the snow melts,

688
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,480
我亲自带你去格林维尔
I'll take you to Greenville myself,

689
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,530
找出他们把你老婆带去哪里了
and we'll find where they sent your wife.

690
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,800
你为什么在意我的事
Why you care what happen to me?

691
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:06,440
你为什么在乎我找不找得到我老婆
Why you care if I find my wife?

692
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:08,250
坦白说
Frankly...

693
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:12,310
我之前从未给过任何人自由
I've never given anybody their freedom before.

694
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:16,030
你是第一个  所以我觉得对你有责任
And now that I have, I feel vaguely responsible for you.

695
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:19,610
何况一个德国人成为真人版西格弗里德
Plus when a German meets a real life Sigfried,

696
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:20,830
也不失为一件好事
that's kind of a big deal.

697
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:26,290
作为德国人  我有义务在你的请求下帮助你
As a German, I'm obliged to help you

698
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,970
救出你亲爱的布鲁姆希尔达
on your quest to rescue your beloved Broomhilda.

699
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:47,990
是谁说的
Ooh, what happened to

700
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:50,950
我要为了赏金杀白种人呢
mister "I wanna shoot white folks for money"?

701
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:52,900
他儿子在旁边
His son's with him.

702
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,010
好吧  他的爱子在身边
Well good. He'll have a loved one with him.

703
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,400
或许还能做最后的道别呢
Maybe even share a last word.

704
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,630
比起其他人好多了
That's better than most of them get,

705
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:05,020
真是三生有幸
and a damn sight better than he deserves.

706
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,140
把枪放下
Put down the rifle.

707
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,160
别紧张  我没怪你
Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.

708
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,060
拿出史密蒂・巴考尔的悬赏令
Just take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.

709
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:27,780
大声念出来
Read it aloud.

710
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,940
就当是今天的课
Consider that today's lesson.

711
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:35,660
悬赏  无论死活

史密蒂・巴考尔和史密蒂・巴考尔

Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash and...

725
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:22,930
疯子克雷格・孔斯
Crazy Craig Koons.

726
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:26,880
这就是史密蒂・巴考尔
That is who Smitty Bacall is.

727
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:29,860
如果史密蒂・巴考尔22岁时想开农场
If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at twenty-two,

728
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:31,930
就不会有这些事了
they would never have printed that.

729
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:35,750
但是他想抢劫马车
But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches,

730
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:38,640
杀人也在所不惜
and he didn't mind killing people to do it.

731
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:42,460
你想干我的工作来救你老婆吗
D'you want to save your wife by doing what I do?

732
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,010
我就是干这个的
This is what I do.

733
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,650
杀人  尸体换赏金
I kill people, and sell their corpses for cash.

734
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,680
这具尸体值7000美金
This corpse is worth seven thousand dollars.

735
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:55,990
收起你的同情心  开枪吧
Now quit your pussyfootin' and shoot him.

736
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,290
爸爸
Pa?

737
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:08,760
爸爸
Pa!

738
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:18,550
给你

739
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:21,290
拿着史密蒂・巴考尔的悬赏令吧
You need to keep this Smitty Bacall handbill.

740
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:22,190
怎么了
Why?

741
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:23,660
幸运符
It's good luck.

742
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:26,520
收好第一份赏金的悬赏令
You always keep the handbill of your first bounty.

743
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,360
精准
That's accurate.

744
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:26,920
医生  姜戈  近来可好
Doctor, Django, how the hell are ya?

745
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,030
你们拖了什么东西来
Who the hell have you got there?

746
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,620
威尔逊・劳帮
The Wilson-Lowe Gang.

747
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:35,750
威尔逊・劳帮是谁
Who the hell is the Wilson-Lowe Gang?

748
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:39,200
坏人查克・威尔逊和更坏的波比・劳
Bad Chuck Wilson and meaner Bobby Lowe,

749
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,980
还有他们的三个助手
and three of their acolytes.

750
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,050
就放外边吧  他们也跑不了
Well just leave 'em out here, they ain't goin' nowhere.

751
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:48,950
别在冰天雪地里冻着  进来喝点咖啡
Let's comin' outta the snowy snow and git yourself some coffee.

752
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:52,080
昨天刚有人过生日  来吃点蛋糕
Had a birthday yesterday, got some cake!

753
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,810
不错
Pretty good.

754
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:09,810
寒冬过后  大赚一笔的姜戈和舒尔茨医生下山了  启程去...

755
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:22,580
密西西比州

756
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:17,580
快走
Move along!

757
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:24,660
快走
Do it, walk!

758
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:28,580
别停
Keep moving.

759
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:35,120
别踩点泥巴就偷懒  快走
Don't let that mud slow you down, keep going.

760
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,260
快走
Keep on.

761
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:57,950
布鲁姆希尔达・冯・夏福特  27岁
Broomhilda Von Shaft, age twenty-seven,

762
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,460
右脸烙有R
"R" on right cheek…

763
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,810
卡尔文・坎迪
Calvin Candy.

764
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,730
他拥有密西西比
He owns the fourth biggest

765
00:59:05,730 --> 00:59:08,390
第四大棉花种植园  坎迪庄园
cotton plantation in Mississippi, Candyland.

766
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,360
坎迪庄园
Candyland?

767
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:11,530
你听说过吗
Oh so you've heard of it?

768
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:13,470
奴隶中无人不知
Ain't no slave that ain't heard of Candyland.

769
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:16,120
你老婆就在那
Well, apparently that's where you wife is,

770
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:19,470
在这讨厌的先生手里
and that's the repelling gentleman who owns her.

771
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,110
但愿她在外面干活  就能在田里干掉他
Let's just hope she works in the out, slaying in the field.

772
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,820
不  她不在田里
Oh no, she ain't in the field, mate.

773
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:26,250
她  很美
She... she pretty.

774
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,640
身材高挑
and she a tall girl, too.

775
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,410
她逃跑被抓回来
The one you tore back up on the nag...

776
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,710
他就在她脸上烙了字
he burnt her runaway on her cheek.

777
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,410
他们坏透了
They got damned.

778
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:44,410
她不下田
She no field nigger, but she

779
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:46,420
也不再干屋里的活了
ain't good enough for the house no more either.

780
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:48,420
他们想让她成为慰安妇
They're gonna try to make her comfort girl.

781
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:50,190
什么慰安  懂了
What's a comfort- Oh.

782
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:53,070
现在我获得了自由
Now while I got freedom...

783
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:55,690
手里有枪
Now while I got my gun.

784
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,580
我们要花钱买她吗
So do we offer to buy her?

785
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:04,300
这么
So...

786
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:07,300
说吧
say...

787
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:12,530
一个人想买一匹马
a man wants to buy a horse...

788
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:14,990
需要买一匹马
needs to buy a horse.

789
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:19,550
他来到农场  敲了敲农场主的大门
He walks up to the farmer's farm, he knocks on the farmer's door,

790
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,350
找他买马
and asks the farmer to buy his horse.

791
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,000
你知道农场主会怎么回答吗
And you know what the farmer says,

792
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,360
农场主说  不
the farmer says: "No".

793
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:29,310
我说  让农场主滚蛋
Well I say: fuck that farmer.

794
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,380
我去偷马
And I'm stealin' that horse.

795
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:34,610
有道理  但是你就成了偷马贼
Fair enough, but now you are horse thief,

796
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:36,310
偷马贼要被绞死的
and they hang horse thieves.

797
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,840
更不要说马要还回原主人那里
Not to mention the horse goes back to its original owner,

798
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:40,690
因为马是他的财产
because the horse is still its property.

799
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:44,350
我们要得到她  需要一份卖契
We need her and we need a bill of sale.

800
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:47,150
但是如果不买  怎么得到呢
But if we ain't gonna try to buy, then how we gonna get it?

801
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:51,870
我能说说我的办法吗
May I offer an alternative plan for action?

802
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:53,390
说吧
Go ahead.

803
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:57,780
这个人来到农场
The man walks up to the farmer's farm,

804
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:59,800
敲了敲农场主的大门
he knocks on the farmer's door,

805
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,360
不是说要买马 
and asks not to buy the horse,

806
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,910
而是要买农场
but the farm,

807
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:09,000
开出天价 
and makes an offer so ridiculous,

808
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,020
农场主不得不答应
the farmer's forced to say yes.

809
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,440
我们要买坎迪庄园吗
We're gonna offer to buy Candyland?

810
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:16,770
不  太贵了
No, it's far too big, but apparently,

811
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:19,070
但是显然农场主不是只有农场
this farmer ain't all about the farm.

812
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:22,740
你对曼丁果搏斗知道多少
How much do you know about mandingo fighting?

813
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:22,740
一项让奴隶为主人的娱乐和敛财搏斗至死的赌博活动

814
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:23,680
什么
What?

815
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:25,720
你能不被怀疑地化妆成
Can you convincingly masquerade

816
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:28,630
精于曼丁果搏斗的行家吗
of someone who's an expert on mandingo fighting?

817
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:29,820
为什么
Why?

818
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:31,440
因为我的角色是来自杜塞尔多夫[德国城市]
Because my character is

819
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,910
的大手笔买家
that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf,

820
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:37,290
来格林维尔  想通过曼丁果搏斗大赚一笔
here in Greenville to buy my way into the mandingo fight game,

821
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:38,810
你的角色是受我雇佣的
and your character is the

822
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:41,230
精于曼丁果搏斗的行家
mandingo expert I hired to help me do it.

823
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,070
人称独眼龙查理
They call that "One-Eyed Charly".

824
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:47,850
您好[法语]
Bonjour.

825
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:51,110
晚上好  黑人女士平[法语]
Bonsoir, p'tite femme noire,

826
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:53,710
我们来拜访卡尔文・坎迪先生
we are here to see Mr. Calvin Candy.

827
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:55,580
请进
Enter.

828
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,640
谢谢
Thank you.

829
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:02,630
你想让我扮做黑奴贩子吗
You want me to play a black slaver?

830
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:05,730
没有比黑奴贩子地位更低的了
Ain't nothin lower than a black slaver.

831
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:09,240
黑奴贩子连家奴管家都不如
A black slaver is lower than a head house nigger.

832
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:12,220
真是狗屁不如
And buddy, that's pretty fuckin' low.

833
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:15,760
那就扮做黑奴贩子
Then play him that way,

834
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:19,780
就做黑奴贩子

840
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:41,890
本职工作  何足挂齿
Nonsense, it's my job.

841
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:45,670
这位就是独眼龙查理吧  久仰久仰
So, this is the One-Eyed Charly I've heard so much about.

842
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:47,700
是的  这就是自由人姜戈
Yes, this is Django Freeman.

843
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,790
姜戈  这位是坎迪的律师  利奥尼迪・莫盖尔
Django, this is Mr. Candie's lawyer, Leonide Moguy.

844
01:02:50,930 --> 01:02:52,600
叫我利奥就好
Just call me Leo.

845
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:56,290
卡尔文在凯撒厅  我为您带路好吗
Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room, y'all wanna follow me?

846
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,830
您和卡尔文先生认识多久了
How long have you been associated with Mr. Candie?

847
01:02:58,910 --> 01:03:00,420
我11岁就认识卡尔文的父亲了
Oh, Calvin's father and I were

848
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:03,120
我们一起就读寄宿学校
about eleven when we went to boarding school together.

849
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:06,430
卡尔文的祖父送我进的法学院
Calvins' father's father put me through law school.

850
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:09,660
几乎可以说  我生来就是卡尔文家的律师
One could almost say, I was raised to be Calvin's lawyer.

851
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,060
几乎可以说  你生来就是他家的奴隶
One could almost say, you's a nigger.

852
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:13,980
你说什么
What did you say?

853
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:15,210
我说
I say...

854
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,340
没什么  他没教养
Real nothing, he's just being cheeky.

855
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:19,200
会见坎迪先生之前
Now, anything else about Mr.

856
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,920
有需要嘱咐的吗
Candie that I should know before I meet him?

857
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:24,100
他有点亲法
Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.

858
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:26,000
文明的绅士不都是如此吗
Ah, what civilized people aren't?

859
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:28,470
相比于英语  他喜欢听用法语称呼他坎迪先生
And he prefers Monsieur Candie to Mister Candie.

860
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:30,610
他喜欢怎么叫就怎么叫吧[法语]
Hmm, si c'est cela qu'il préfère.

861
01:03:30,770 --> 01:03:32,210
他不会说法语
He doesn't speak French.

862
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:35,020
别在他面前说法语  会让他很难堪
Don't speak French to him, it'll embarrass him.

863
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,560
打回来  翻身
Get back on top now, turn around.

864
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:41,700
对了
There you go.

865
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:43,610
非常好
There you go.

866
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:48,280
你为什么要加入曼丁果这行
Why do you want to get in the mandingo business?

867
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,060
你没打算让
You don't intend to allow

868
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:55,140
你的副手做些说明吗
your second to make the proper introductions?

869
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,850
别推脱  回答这个问题
Quit stalling now. Answer the question.

870
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:02,940
想听听可怕的真相
The awful truth?

871
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:04,860
我就是太无聊了
Pff, I'm bored.

872
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:06,810
这个好像很好玩
This seems like a good bit of fun.

873
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:14,250
过来吧
Well, come on over.

874
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,130
正好有一场搏斗  确实很有趣
We got us a fight goin' on, that's a good bit of fun.

875
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:23,130
和我去吧台喝一杯吗
Won't you accompany me to the bar?

876
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:34,210
我也知道  不能在这屋子里乱走
You don't go ahead in a house, white man, even I know that.

877
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:45,060
-舒尔茨医生  -见到你
- Dr. Schultz... C What a real pleasure

878
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:46,680
别停  黑鬼
Keep fighting, niggers!

879
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:48,300
是我的荣幸
and I might add, an honor.

880
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,880
我也很荣幸  请坐  别客气
Honored to meet you, please have a seat, the pleasure's all mine.

881
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,650
看看自由人姜戈要喝什么
Get Freeman Django here whatever he wants.

882
01:04:55,370 --> 01:04:57,190
我来一杯甜杜松子波本酒
And I'll have sweet gin bourbon.

883
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:19,590
快上  按我说的做
You go way, boy, you do what I tell you!

884
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:22,460

He's got big and strong!

885
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,520

890
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:45,220
往地毯上打  把他打趴下[意大利语]
Ecco I con la spola tappeto. La spola tappeto giù.

891
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:47,570
大块头弗雷德  加油
Big Fred, com'on!

892

往死里打

904
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:23,710
你不会输的

结果了他
Go on, boy, finish him!

908
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,510
所以他叫大块头弗雷德
That's why they call him big Fred!

909
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:59,260
物有所值
Worth every penny.

910
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:01,050

机缘巧合把我俩凑到一起

恕我直言  坎迪先生

961
01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:02,220
我不是来咨询您的意见的
I didn't seek you out for your advice.

962
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:04,060
我来找您是想买一个搏斗奴隶

出价会高于市场价

964
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:10,170
在您给我看了这场表演之后

965
01:10:10,190 --> 01:10:12,530
我们该谈谈生意了吧
it would be to discuss business.

966
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:17,210
但是我们没在谈生意
But we weren't talking business yet.

967
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,750
我们是在谈我的好奇心
We were discussing my curiosity.

968
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:26,150
罗斯科  可可  出去吧
Roscoe, Coco, go outside and play.

969
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:29,420
希巴
Sheba,

970
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:31,600
你留下
you stay right there.

971
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:34,070
我知道你离不开我
I know you didn't name me.

972
01:10:35,330 --> 01:10:36,450
祝好
Prost.

973
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:37,820
你也是
Jambo.

974
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,170
据莫盖尔说
Now according to Moguy,

975
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:44,880
我和你做生意  就是和你们俩做生意
if I do business with you, I'm doin' business with both of y'all.

976
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:47,460
他鉴定  你出钱  是吗
He does the eyeballin', you the billfold, is that it?

977
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:49,080
你不用奉承我
Well, you don't make it

978
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:52,030
不过的确是这样
sound too flattering, but more or less, yeah.

979
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:54,900
那么
So...

980
01:10:55,450 --> 01:10:56,850
机灵小子
Bright Boy,

981
01:10:57,070 --> 01:10:59,380
莫盖尔告诉我说  你看过我的非洲勇士
Moguy tells me you looked over my African flesh,

982
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,300
却不以为然  是吗
and you was none too impressed, huh?

983
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,300
不值大价钱
Not for top dollar.

984
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:07,240
那就没什么好谈的了
Well then we got nothing more to talk about.

985
01:11:07,450 --> 01:11:09,520
你想从我这买搏斗黑鬼
You see, you wanna buy a beat ass nigger from me,

986
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,080
这就是我要卖的搏斗黑鬼
those was all the beat ass niggers I wanna sell, so...

987
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:14,610
他想买的不是你想卖的
He don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna sell.

988
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:17,940
而是你不想卖的
He wants the nigger you don't wanna sell.

989
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:22,520
我不想卖的我不会卖
I don't sell the niggers I don't wanna sell.

990
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:28,420
也就是说  你不会卖最好的
Well, hm. You won't sell your best.

991
01:11:28,650 --> 01:11:30,570
也不会卖次好的
You won't even sell your second best.

992
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:34,650
连第三好的  都不卖
But your third best you don't want to sell him either...

993
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:36,480
但是如果我开出天价
but if I made you an offer

994
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,920
你不得不卖呢
so ridiculous you'd be forced to consider it...

995
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:42,790
谁知道会怎样呢
who knows what could happen?

996
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:46,680
你说多少算天价
And what do you consider ridiculous?

997
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:51,980
对于一个真正有天分的苗子  怎么说"理想黑鬼"
For a truly talented specimen, well "The Right Nigger"?

998
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:55,310
你说出多少来着  姜戈
How much would you say, Django?

999
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:00,500
12000美元
Twelve thousand dollars.

1000
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:06,600
先生们
Gentlemen...

1001
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,770
你们勾起我的好奇心了
You had my curiosity.

1002
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:10,900
我现在专心听你讲
Now you have my attention.

1003
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:27,140
威利  威利
Willie... Willie.

1004
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:29,000
停下  停下
Hold up! Hold up.

1005
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,050
早上好  先生们
Good morning, gentlemen.

1006
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:35,200
早上好  舒尔茨医生  天气不错
Good Dr. Schultz. Beautiful morning isn't it?

1007
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:37,290
找不到更好的了
You couldn't have picked a better one.

1008
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:40,360
和我们共行一段如何
Please, won't you take a ride with us here in the Victorian.

1009
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:42,060
非常感谢
Oh, thank you very much.

1010
01:12:42,110 --> 01:12:44,270
把你的马栓在后面
Tie your horse up back there.

1011
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:53,460
姜戈
Django!

1012
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,820
我和那些物候学同仁不同
Well I part company from many of my phenologist colleagues,

1013
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:07,160
我相信在聪慧  天赋  忠诚这些方面
cause I believe there's a level above bright, above talented

1014
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:11,150
有些黑人能达到更高层次
above loyal that a nigger can aspire.

1015
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:16,660
万分之一的几率
Say one nigger that just pops up on ten thousand.

1016
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:18,530
会出现超乎寻常的黑鬼
The exceptional nigger.

1017
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:21,260
天气不错啊  机灵小子
Bright day uh, Bright Boy?

1018
01:13:22,390 --> 01:13:23,790
太阳升起
Sun is up.

1019
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:26,570
普照大地
Shinin' on all of us.

1020
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:33,270
请坐  医生
Have a seat, Doc.

1021
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:35,940
荣幸之至
Great an honor.

1022
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:37,380
我们的荣幸
The honor is all ours.

1023
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,090
谢谢
Thank you.

1024
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:41,070
但是我相信  只要耐心等待
but I do believe that given time,

1025
01:13:41,070 --> 01:13:44,430
像这机灵小子一样的优秀黑人
exceptional niggers like Bright Boy here,

1026
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:47,470
就会出现  只要不给他自由
will come if not freedom...

1027
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,640
更多的自由
more freedom...

1028
01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:53,010
机灵小子
Bright Boy,

1029
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:55,960
你就是那万中挑一的人才
you are that one in ten thousand.

1030
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:59,330
是让你跟上  不是赶上  黑鬼
The name of the game is keep up, not catch up, nigger.

1031
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:16,510
敢碰枪  你就死定了
Touch your guns, you're dead.

1032
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,340
大家冷静
Everybody calm down!

1033
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:20,940
我都看到了  不要掐架
I saw the whole thing, no harm done.

1034
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:22,630
你开什么玩笑  这个黑鬼
Are you- Are you kiddin' me, this nigger...

1035
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:26,160
我说了不要掐架  把手从枪上拿开
I said no harm done! Now take your hands off your pistol!

1036
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:28,910
布奇
Butch!

1037
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:31,070
你也是
That means you too.

1038
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,650
任何人都不得激怒我的客人
Ev'rybody stop antagonizing my guests.

1039
01:14:36,350 --> 01:14:37,230
你
Who!

1040
01:14:37,490 --> 01:14:39,110
上马
Git back upon your horse.

1041
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:40,870
我锁骨被他摔裂了
He broke my collarbone!

1042
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,840
老天  没人帮他一下吗
For God sake, somebody please

1043
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:45,570
扶他上马
help Who here back upon his goddamn horse.

1044
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:48,630
你这黑鬼倒会走狗屎运
Ooh, now you are one lucky nigger.

1045
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:51,680
你得听你老板的  小白脸
You got to listen to your boss, white boy.

1046
01:14:51,770 --> 01:14:54,120
也许某夜的月光下  我就会来找你算账
Oh I'm a good walk in any moonlight for you.

1047
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,140
来和我握手吗
You wanna hold my hand?

1048
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:05,210
威利  回家
Willie! Take us home.

1049
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:28,610
一百个坏人我要一百口黑色的棺木
I need a hundred black coffins for a hundred bad men

1050
01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:32,110
将他们深深埋葬一百座漆黑的坟墓
A hundred black graves so I can lay they ass in

1051
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:35,720
布道是一百名牧师身穿乌黑的教服
I need a hundred black preachers, with a black sermon to tell

1052
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:39,140
一百本黑暗的圣经指引他们的末路
From a hundred black bibles, while we send them all to hell

1053
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:41,280
我要一百口黑棺木
I nseed a hundred black coffins

1054
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:45,100
黑棺木  黑棺木
black coffins, black coffins.

1055
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:48,100
我要一百口黑棺木
Oh, Lord! I need a hundred black coffins

1056
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:51,810
黑棺木
black coffins. Oh, Lord!

1057
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:54,160
我要一百口黑棺木
Black coffins! I need a hundred...

1058
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:04,540
你眼睛有毛病吗  小子
You got a problem with your eyeball, boy?

1059
01:16:04,650 --> 01:16:05,660
没有
No sir.

1060
01:16:05,730 --> 01:16:08,130
找踹吗
You wan' a boot heel in it?

1061
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:09,500
不
No sir.

1062
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:11,920
那就别用那该死的眼神看我
Then keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.

1063
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:14,530
再敢看一次
Flash that bad look at me again,

1064
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:16,120
我会让你知道我不是好惹的
I give you a reason not to like me.

1065
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,360
跟上  黑鬼
Now move, nigger!

1066
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:21,920
你们要知道
You niggers gonna understand somethin' 'bout me.

1067
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:23,930
我比那些白人还难伺候
I'm worse than any o'these white men here.

1068
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:25,900
眼睛放放好
You keep them eyelash inside your ass,

1069
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:27,570
别用那该死的眼神看我
you keep them goddamn eyeballs off me.

1070
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:31,050
他可真够粗暴的  是吧
He is a rambunctious sort, ain't it?

1071
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:32,400
确实
Indeed!

1072
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:36,210
停一下好吗
May you stop for a moment,

1073
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:38,150
我有话和他说
so I may put put a word in my man's ear?

1074
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:39,930
我期待着为坎迪庄园的勇士们
Yeah, I'm expecting to fall

1075
01:16:39,930 --> 01:16:42,240
而折腰
in love once I see the specimen of Candyland,

1076
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:45,660
但此之前  我还是想和我的军师
so before that moment, it would be good if I could have

1077
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:49,720
开个机密会议
a confidential strategy meeting with my... confident.

1078
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:54,820
你是来告诉我  你是在干嘛吗
You mind tellin' me what the hell you doing?

1079
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:57,430
我确定布鲁姆希尔达在坎迪庄园
I've confirmed that Broomhilda's at Candyland.

1080
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:02,430
你怎么确定是她
Are you sure it's her?

1081
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,870
他没告诉我名字  但说是一个年轻女性
He didn't call her by name, but she's a young lady,

1082
01:17:04,890 --> 01:17:06,840
背上有鞭痕  说德语
whip marks on her back, and speaks German.

1083
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:09,360
虽然妄自揣测不明智
Now while it's not wise to assume,

1084
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,790
当前情况下  我觉得还很安全
in this instance, I think it's pretty safe.

1085
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:13,300
重点是
Point being...

1086
01:17:13,650 --> 01:17:16,470
收起你那报复心理
don't get so carried away with your retribution.

1087
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:18,750
我们都快忘了为什么要过来了
We lose sight on why we're here.

1088
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,080
你觉得我忘了吗
You think I lost sight, did I?

1089
01:17:20,110 --> 01:17:23,070
没错  别再激怒坎迪了
Yes, I do! Stop antagonizing Candy!

1090
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:25,980
要穿帮了
You're going to blow this whole charade,

1091
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:28,630
我们两个都会被杀掉
or more than likely get both of us killed,

1092
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:30,430
我可不想死在
and I, for one, don't intend

1093
01:17:30,430 --> 01:17:33,410
美国密西西比州奇卡索人县
to die in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, U.S.A.

1094
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:36,380
我不是在激怒他  是在引起他兴趣
I'm not antagonizing. I'm intriguing him.

1095
01:17:36,670 --> 01:17:39,400
你辱骂那些可怜的奴隶
You- you're yelling abuse of these poor slaves!

1096
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:42,000
我想起一个人
I recall the man...

1097
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:45,760
让我当着另一个人儿子的面杀了他  
who had me killed another man in front o' his son,

1098
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,200
那人眼睛都不眨一下
and he didn't bat an eye.

1099
01:17:49,050 --> 01:17:50,450
还记得吗
Remember that?

1100
01:17:52,370 --> 01:17:53,660
我当然记得
Yeah of course I remember!

1101
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,270
你那时说
What you said was...

1102
01:17:55,530 --> 01:17:56,820
你说的  不是我说的
You said, this ain't my word...

1103
01:17:58,350 --> 01:18:00,090
用我的话来说  你得心狠手辣一点
"In my word you got to get dirty".

1104
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:04,070
这就是我在做的  变得心狠手辣
So that's what I'm doing. I'm getting dirty.

1105
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:11,010
我是这么说过  但是
Well you're paraphrasing a tad, but...

1106
01:18:12,530 --> 01:18:14,400
大概就是这样
that was it generally, just...

1107
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:20,240
坎迪庄园见
see you at Candyland.

1108
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:28,700
好了  黑鬼们
Alright niggers!

1109
01:18:29,070 --> 01:18:30,190
干活了
Back at it.

1110
01:18:31,370 --> 01:18:33,470
你也是  月光小子
That means you too, moonlight.

1111
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:23,260
我来处理  达达尼昂
I'll 'be. D'Artagnan!

1112
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:26,950
为什么要逃跑呢
Now well, why do a fool thing like run off?

1113
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:29,590
我不能再打架了  坎迪先生
I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candy.

1114
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,240
你可以的
Yes you can!

1115
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,630
你可能不会赢  但是打架还是可以的
You might not be able to win, but your ass can fight.

1116
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:37,270
斯通菲尔先生  能让这狗东西闭嘴吗
Mr. Stonesipher, would you please shut these goddamn dogs up,

1117
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:38,580
我都听不清自己讲话了
I cannot hear myself think!

1118
01:19:38,610 --> 01:19:43,400
安静  玛莎  安静
Hush now, Marsha! Hush up, Marsha! Marsha, hush up!

1119
01:19:43,550 --> 01:19:46,890
把狗牵走
Hey, get these goddamn dogs away from this nigger!

1120
01:19:56,070 --> 01:19:57,890
小伙子
Well now boy...

1121
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:00,740
-下来吧  -遵命
- gidown o' that tree. - Yes sir.

1122
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:25,250
他跑了有多久
How long was he lose?

1123
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:27,160
一夜
A night...

1124
01:20:27,850 --> 01:20:28,970
一天
day...

1125
01:20:29,770 --> 01:20:30,890
再加上前天后半夜
Half the other night.

1126
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:33,990
跑了多远
How far he git off property?

1127
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:35,880
差不多3000里
Bout twenty miles off prop.

1128
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:38,630
对于一个瘸子来说够远了
Pretty fer, conside'ing that limp he got.

1129
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:44,230
莫盖尔先生  达达尼昂星期五应该和谁打
Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan supposed to fight on Friday?

1130
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:45,780
这群新人
One of this new lot.

1131
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:50,230
这情势看着  印度瞎子都能把他消灭
The way he looks now, a blind Indian wouldn't bet a bead on 'em.

1132
01:20:50,290 --> 01:20:53,140
求你了  坎迪先生  我不会再跑了
Please Mr. Candy, I ain't got it, ain't it no more, I can't-

1133
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:56,160
别别别  别再求我了
No no no no, now no beggin'...

1134
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,110
我心软  听不得人求
No playin' on my soft heart.

1135
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:04,870
你现在有麻烦了
You're in trouble, now son.

1136
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:12,000
我买你花了500美元
I done paid 500 dollars for you...

1137
01:21:12,410 --> 01:21:14,680
500美元啊
When I pay 500 dollars...

1138
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,620
我希望在他战死之前
I expect to get five fights

1139
01:21:16,630 --> 01:21:19,380
能打5场
outta a nigga 'fore he rollover and play dead.

1140
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:22,940
这么说吧  我是生意人
Got to understand, I'm... I'm running a business here!

1141
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,430
你打了3场
You- you fought three fights.

1142
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:26,830
可是我都赢了
But I won everyone!

1143
01:21:26,870 --> 01:21:28,460
是啊  没错
Yes you did. Yes you did,

1144
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:29,460
但是上一场
but that last one, you

1145
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:31,420
你赢得可是够悬的
muddled the line between winning and losing.

1146
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:36,990
是这么个情况
Still the fact remain.

1147
01:21:37,530 --> 01:21:40,740
我出了500美元  希望能打5场
I pay 500 dollars, I want five goddamn fights!

1148
01:21:41,590 --> 01:21:43,430
我的钱都到哪去了呢
So what 'bout my five hundred dollars, huh?

1149
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:47,330
我的钱都到哪去了呢
What about my five hundred dollars?

1150
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:50,720
你还我吗
You go n' reimburse me?!

1151
01:21:56,850 --> 01:21:59,810
你都不知道"还"是什么意思
You even know what reimburse means?

1152
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,340
我还你
I'll reimburse you!

1153
01:22:13,010 --> 01:22:14,410
你
You will?

1154
01:22:19,850 --> 01:22:21,540
你花500美元
You pay 500 dollars...

1155
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:26,160
买一个连扫帚都拿不起来的独眼老乔
for pratic'lly a one eyed Ole'Joe ain't fit to push a broom?

1156
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:27,710
他不是这意思
No, he won't.

1157
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:31,720
他就是不喜欢你玩弄黑鬼
He's just tired of you toyin' with him, is all.

1158
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,300
不可否认  我也是
Matter o' facts, so am I.

1159
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:37,170
但是我们不会为这个黑鬼浪费一毛钱
But we ain't payin' a penny for that pickaninny,

1160
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,560
没必要  是吧  医生
ain't got no use for 'em, ain't that right, Doc?

1161
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:42,120
就是这样
You heard 'em!

1162
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:56,150
我得请求斯通菲尔先生原谅你的放肆
I'm gonna have to excuse Mr. Stonesipher slack jaw gaze, he...

1163
01:22:56,370 --> 01:22:58,900
他这辈子都没见过你这样的黑人
he ain't never seen a nigger like you ever in his life.

1164
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,540
是吗  斯通菲尔先生
Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?

1165
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:05,440
没错
That right.

1166
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:07,510
没必要
That matter...

1167
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:11,070
剑拔弩张的
Won't have that.

1168
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:17,760
那么
Now...

1169
01:23:19,070 --> 01:23:22,030
既然你一毛钱都不会出
Sin'e as you won't pay a penny for this pickaninny here...

1170
01:23:24,770 --> 01:23:27,740
我对这黑鬼做什么你都不介意吧
you won't mind me handlin' this nigger anyway I see fit?

1171
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:30,420
他是你的奴隶
He's your nigger.

1172
01:23:34,530 --> 01:23:35,810
斯通菲尔先生
Mr. Stonesipher?

1173
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:40,750
让玛莎和那贱狗送达达尼昂去天堂
Let Marsha and her bitches send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.

1174
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:44,680
玛莎  上啊
Marsha! Git the nigger!

1175
01:24:23,530 --> 01:24:25,880
看起来你老板
Your boss looks a little green around the gills

1176
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:27,790
不大适应观赏黑鬼搏斗啊
for a blood sport like 'nigger fightin'?

1177
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:29,090
不是
No.

1178
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:32,890
他只是不习惯看人被狗撕裂  而已
He just ain't use to seein' a man ripped apart by dogs, is all.

1179
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:37,000
你习惯吗
You are used to it?

1180
01:24:37,230 --> 01:24:40,730
比他更习惯美国
I'm just a little more use to American's than he is.

1181
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:44,410
坎迪先生
Now... Monsieur Candy,

1182
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:46,620
你准备好了没有
whenever you're ready.

1183
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:49,730
我们可是长途跋涉5个小时来看你的存货的
We rode five hours so you could show off your stock.

1184
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:52,210
给我们看看吧
Let's git to it.

1185
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:55,610
如果都是这个样子
Cause as of now, if he's an example...

1186
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:57,220
我也不稀罕
I ain't impressed.

1187
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:01,360
跟我来
Follow me.

1188
01:25:58,890 --> 01:26:00,630
密西西比银行

1189
01:26:58,890 --> 01:27:00,630
黑鬼在左边排好
Line up to the left here now niggers.

1190
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:06,860
就这样
That's it.

1191
01:27:09,690 --> 01:27:11,570
排成一排  排成一排
You gimme a line, gimme a line.

1192
01:27:11,650 --> 01:27:13,710
排排好  快点
Get in line here. Right now!

1193
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:15,070
你好  亲爱的史蒂芬
Hello, Steven my boy!

1194
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:17,350
主人回来啦
Yeah yeah yeah, hello my ass.

1195
01:28:17,830 --> 01:28:20,710
马上的黑人是谁
Who this nigger up on that nag?

1196
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:22,660
史蒂芬  你还真是嗦
Oh Steven, you have nags for breakfast.

1197
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:25,660
脾气还这么坏  你想我了吗
What's the matter, why so ornery, you miss me, huh?

1198
01:28:25,690 --> 01:28:30,010
当然想  就像屋子想念鲜花
Oh-oh yes sir, I miss you like a home miss flower,

1199
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:34,170
就像宝宝想念妈妈的泰迪
like a - like a- a baby miss Mum n' Teddy,

1200
01:28:34,820 --> 01:28:39,040
想你  就像想念鞋子里的石子
I miss you like I misses a rock in my shoe.

1201
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:45,710
那我问你  马上的黑人是谁
Now I ask you: who this nigger, on that nag?

1202
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:46,660
雪球
Hey Snowball.

1203
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:51,880
要是想知道我或者我的马的名字  直接来问我
If you wanna know my name or the name of my horse, you ask me.

1204
01:28:52,470 --> 01:28:55,190
你叫谁雪球啊  马夫
Just who the hell you callin' Snowball, horse boy?

1205
01:28:55,310 --> 01:28:58,080
我能把你脖子拧下来  你信不信
I'll snap your black ass of that nag there in the mud-

1206
01:28:58,140 --> 01:29:00,770
史蒂芬  史蒂芬
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Steven, Steven.

1207
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:02,590
他开玩笑呢
Let's keep it funny.

1208
01:29:03,030 --> 01:29:04,640
姜戈是自由人
Django here is a Freeman.

1209
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:07,340
-这黑鬼吗  -就是这个黑鬼
- This nigger here? - That nigger there.

1210
01:29:07,820 --> 01:29:09,960
我来给你介绍他们
Let me at least introduce the two of you.

1211
01:29:10,330 --> 01:29:11,670
姜戈  这里还有一个
Django, this is another

1212
01:29:11,670 --> 01:29:14,120
跟你肤色一样的坏脾气家伙  史蒂芬
cheeky black bugger like yourself, Steven.

1213
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:15,910
史蒂芬  这是姜戈
Steven, this is Django.

1214
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,590
还真是同色相斥
You two ought to hate each other.

1215
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:19,200
卡尔文  你要招待的这个黑鬼
Calvin, just who the hell

1216
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:21,860
到底是什么来头
is this nigger you feel the need to entertain?

1217
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:25,760
姜戈和他朋友舒尔茨医生是顾客
Django, and his friend in grey here Dr. Schultz are customers,

1218
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:27,610
是我们的客人  史蒂芬
and they are our guests, Steven,

1219
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:29,560
而你  这个老家伙
and you, you old decrepit bastard,

1220
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:31,560
得好好款待他们
are to show them every hospitality.

1221
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,750
-懂了吗  -遵命  先生  我明白
- You understand that? - Yessir, here I'm understandin',

1222
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:35,720
但是我不明白为什么要招呼这个黑人
but I don't know why I gotta take lip off this nigger?

1223
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:38,760
你不需要知道为什么  明白吗
You don't hafta know why. Do you understand?

1224
01:29:39,260 --> 01:29:41,220
遵命  我明白了
Yes sir, I understand.

1225
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:42,440
很好
Oh good!

1226
01:29:42,670 --> 01:29:43,780
他们要在这住
They're spendin' the night,

1227
01:29:43,780 --> 01:29:45,690
把客房收拾下  安顿好他们
go up in the guest bedrooms and get two ready.

1228
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:48,580
他要住这里
He gonna stay in the Big House?

1229
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:50,990
史蒂芬  他是奴隶贩子  不是奴隶
Steven, he's a slaver. It's different.

1230
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,390
住在这里
In the Big House?

1231
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:53,800
你有问题吗
Well you gotta problem with that?

1232
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:56,260
没  没有问题
No, no no I got no problem with it,

1233
01:29:56,310 --> 01:29:58,030
不过他们在这
with you I gotta problem with burnin' the bed,

1234
01:29:58,030 --> 01:29:59,110
能把床铺给烧了
the sheets, the pillow cases,

1235
01:29:59,130 --> 01:30:01,150
还有被单和枕头
ev'rything up when this black ass motherfuckers gone!

1236
01:30:01,170 --> 01:30:03,160
那是我的事  烧也是烧我的
Now that is my problem, they are mine to burn!

1237
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:05,620
你的任务就是安排好床铺
Now your problem right now is making a good impression.

1238
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:07,920
我希望你赶紧去做
And I want you to start solving that problem right now,

1239
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:09,580
把房间收拾好
and git them goddamn rooms ready!

1240
01:30:11,730 --> 01:30:12,880
遵命  坎迪先生
Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.

1241
01:30:14,860 --> 01:30:16,260
快去
Go on now.

1242
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:19,550
真不敢想象你让一个黑鬼住家里
Can't believe you brought a nigger to stay in the Big House.

1243
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:21,560
世风日下  黑鬼自由
You get a rollin' over and it's God man free right now.

1244
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:22,220
他还在嘀嘀咕咕
He had a lip on you.

1245
01:30:22,410 --> 01:30:24,820
黑鬼也有地位  这叫什么事
A nigger in the estate part. What shit is that!?

1246
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:26,000
好了
Now.

1247
01:30:26,190 --> 01:30:30,490
我漂亮的姐姐呢
Where is my beautiful sister!

1248
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:32,380
在这
There she is!

1249
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:39,300
舒尔茨医生  这位迷人的南方美女就是我寡居的姐姐
Dr. Schultz, this attractive southern belle is my widowed sister.

1250
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:43,610
亲爱的  你就是我眼中的钻石
Darling, you are a diamond for tired eyes.

1251
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:48,210
我来给你们介绍劳拉・李・坎迪威利
May I present to you Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.

1252
01:30:48,270 --> 01:30:49,940
彻斯特  罗德尼  小鸡查理
Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charlie,

1253
01:30:49,940 --> 01:30:51,760
去那边山上
you'll git your ass up on that hill.

1254
01:30:51,790 --> 01:30:53,130
快点  查理  动作快
Com'on Charlie, go on now.

1255
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:55,140
快点  你知道在哪里
Go, com'on now. You know where it is.

1256
01:30:55,610 --> 01:30:57,000
像被绳子牵着跑
Like you on a rope!

1257
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:00,690
黑鬼哪能慢吞吞地走  快跑
Niggers don't walk 'round here! Niggers run!

1258
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:03,620
-坎迪先生  -什么
- Ah, Monsieur Candie? - Hmm?

1259
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:08,760
我们说到的那个黑人姑娘
About that matter, about the nigger girl we were talking about?

1260
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:09,800
黑人姑娘
Nigger girl?

1261
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:13,200
你提过的  会说德语
Yeah, I believe you mentioned she spoke German?

1262
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:15,780
是的  希尔迪  她怎么了
Ah yes, Hildi, what about her?

1263
01:31:16,130 --> 01:31:17,460
表演之前
Do you think before the

1264
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:20,410
能不能把她送到我房间
demonstration you could send her around to my room?

1265
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:23,070
原来你好这口
You little Dickens, you!

1266
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:24,800
没问题
I don't see why not.

1267
01:31:24,820 --> 01:31:26,040
史蒂芬  带他们去房间前
Steven, when you get through

1268
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:27,950
把希尔迪带来
showing them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi,

1269
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:29,740
洗的干干净净  香喷喷的
get her cleaned up and smellin' nice,

1270
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:31,440
送到舒尔茨医生房间
and sent over to Dr. Schultz's room.

1271
01:31:31,490 --> 01:31:33,150
实际上  坎迪先生
Actually, Monsieur Candie,

1272
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:36,170
有件事我要告诉你
it's- it's somethin' I ain't tole you that yet.

1273
01:31:36,490 --> 01:31:37,010
什么
What?

1274
01:31:37,090 --> 01:31:39,710
希尔迪在热箱
Uh, Hildi in The Hot Box.

1275
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:43,020
她在那干嘛
What's she doin' there?

1276
01:31:43,110 --> 01:31:44,770
还能干嘛
What 'cha think she doin' there,

1277
01:31:44,770 --> 01:31:46,580
受罚呗
in The Hot Box, she bein' punished.

1278
01:31:47,390 --> 01:31:49,540
-她做什么了  -又逃跑
- What did she do? - She ran off again.

1279
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,960
老天  史蒂芬  我不在的日子里跑了多少人
Jesus Christ Steven, how many people ran away while I was gone?

1280
01:31:53,010 --> 01:31:53,910
2个
Two.

1281
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:55,490
她什么时候跑的
And when did she go?

1282
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:58,580
昨晚  他们今天早上抓回来的
Last night, they- they brought her back this morning.

1283
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:01,240
斯通菲尔的狗把她撕碎了吗
How bad did Stonesipher's dogs tear her up?

1284
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:05,300
幸运的很  它们去追达达尼昂了
Lucky for her, they was out chasin' D'Artagnan's ass.

1285
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:07,480
比尔和科迪去找她
Bill and Cody went out lookin' for her,

1286
01:32:07,490 --> 01:32:09,410
找到带了回来
found her and brought her back, uh...

1287
01:32:10,070 --> 01:32:11,200
被教训了一顿
Now she a little beat up,

1288
01:32:11,270 --> 01:32:12,770
但也是她自找的
but- but she done that the all damn self,

1289
01:32:12,770 --> 01:32:14,310
她居然跑过了那些该死的丛林
runnin' through them damn bushes and shit.

1290
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:15,790
她在热箱里多久了
How long she been in the box?

1291
01:32:16,050 --> 01:32:19,040
还能多久  也就一天
How long ya think, she been in there all damn day!

1292
01:32:19,170 --> 01:32:22,280
那贱人还得再待10天
And the lit'le bitch got ten more days be in there.

1293
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:23,840
史蒂芬  把她放出来
Steven, take her out.

1294
01:32:23,970 --> 01:32:25,200
放出来  为什么
Take her out, why?!

1295
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:27,250
我说什么就是什么
Because I said so, that's why.

1296
01:32:27,290 --> 01:32:29,170
舒尔茨是我的客人
Dr. Schultz is my guest.

1297
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:30,940
希尔迪是我的黑奴
Hildi is my nigger,

1298
01:32:30,950 --> 01:32:33,810
按南方人的待客之道我得叫她为他服务
Southern hospitality dictates I make her available to him.

1299
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:36,110
可是坎迪先生  她刚刚逃跑过
But Monsieur Candie, she just ran off.

1300
01:32:36,150 --> 01:32:37,460
我的老天  史蒂芬
Jesus Christ Steven,

1301
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:39,710
如果我养了个会德语的黑奴
what is the point of havin' a nigger that speaks German,

1302
01:32:39,790 --> 01:32:40,940
来了德国客人都不能派上用场
if you can't wheel 'em out

1303
01:32:40,940 --> 01:32:42,170
那还有什么意义
when you have a German guest?

1304
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:46,450
我知道不太方便  但还是给我弄出来吧
Now I realize it is inconvenient but still, you take her ass out!

1305
01:32:46,590 --> 01:32:47,440
遵命
Yes sir.

1306
01:32:49,050 --> 01:32:52,320
劳拉・莉  你能跟科拉一起
Lara Lee, will you and Cora be responsible for getting

1307
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:55,340
把希尔达打扮像样了送来给舒尔茨医生吗
Hilda cleaned up and presentable for Dr. Schultz here?

1308
01:32:55,380 --> 01:32:56,780
当然可以了  亲爱的
Of course, darling.

1309
01:32:56,920 --> 01:32:58,950
先生们  非常抱歉
Now gentlemen, I do apologize,

1310
01:32:58,950 --> 01:33:01,920
旅途太过劳累
but I'm wearer for our travels beyond words,

1311
01:33:02,070 --> 01:33:04,890
我该去好好休息一下了
it is time for me to rest my tired ass.

1312
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:12,380
你们也都听到了  快去把她弄出来
Ya'all have heard the man, get yar ass, all part of it.

1313
01:33:12,910 --> 01:33:14,640
科拉  过来
Cora! Come here!

1314
01:33:15,310 --> 01:33:16,880
你过去帮她收拾干净
Get over there, get her cleaned up,

1315
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:18,410
然后带过来给
bring her back over here to doctor

1316
01:33:18,410 --> 01:33:20,230
什么医生来着  舒尔特吗
what- what did you say your name is, Schut?

1317
01:33:20,410 --> 01:33:21,840
-舒尔茨  -舒尔茨
- Schultz. - Schultz!

1318
01:33:22,230 --> 01:33:24,020
快去把她带回来  明白了吗
Get her back over here, alright girl?

1319
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:25,460
明白了
Yes sir.

1320
01:34:43,460 --> 01:34:44,740
希尔达  你是想给我乖乖过来呢
Hilda, you comin' with me,

1321
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:47,100
还是想继续睡在那个小箱子里
or you gonna sleep in that lit'le box over here?

1322
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:05,100
所谓伊人  在水一方
Ancora qui, ancora tu

1323
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:18,100
通心连理  汝意吾知
Ora però io so chi sei

1324
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:27,100
逝者如斯  汝意不挠
Chi sempre sarai

1325
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:33,100
幸顺天理  若得相望
E quando mi vedrai

1326
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:41,100
历历往昔  但求相忆
ricorderai

1327
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:49,100
所谓伊人  在水一方
Ancora qui, ancora tu

1328
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:56,100
若得再首  伊人宽谅
E spero mi perdonerai

1329
01:35:56,100 --> 01:36:01,100
日月如梭  汝眸犹熠
Tu con gli stessi occhi

1330
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:11,100
斯人似归  问省吾身
Sembri ritornare a chiedermi di me

1331
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:18,100
吾心戚戚  隔水茫茫
Di come si sta

1332
01:36:22,230 --> 01:36:23,590
女士们好
Hello ladies.

1333
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:24,820
舒尔茨医生
Dr. Schultz,

1334
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:27,170
请允许我向您介绍布鲁姆希尔达
may I introduce to you Broomhilda.

1335
01:36:31,310 --> 01:36:33,400
希尔迪  这位是舒尔茨医生
Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.

1336
01:36:35,450 --> 01:36:37,560
很高兴见到你  布鲁姆希尔达
It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.

1337
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:40,930
我听过很多赞美你的话了
I've heard a lot of good things about you.

1338
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,500
很少有黑人会说德语  是吧
Well, it's not often a nigger speaks German, don't you know?

1339
01:36:47,180 --> 01:36:49,440
布鲁姆希尔达  看着你就知道
As I look at you now, Broomhilda,

1340
01:36:49,540 --> 01:36:53,420
为何会有人如此爱慕你了
I could see all the passion you inspire completely justified.

1341
01:36:57,630 --> 01:36:59,730
这位医生是说德语的
The doctor here speaks German!

1342
01:37:01,890 --> 01:37:04,090
我听说你也会说是吗
And I've been informed you do as well?

1343
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:07,480
来  说几句德语听听
Go ahead girl, speak a little German.

1344
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:13,300
能用德语跟您对话很荣幸
Es w?re mir ein Vergnügen, mit Ihnen in Deutsch sprechen.

1345
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,480
太惊人了
Astonishing.

1346
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:19,830
请进吧  小姐
Bitte kommen Sie nach innen, Fr?ulein.

1347
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:27,310
-我应该  -太感谢了
- And I should bring... - Much obliged.

1348
01:37:33,020 --> 01:37:35,530
我给你倒杯水吧
Kann ich gie?en Sie ein Glas Wasser?

1349
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:02,290
别害怕
Don't be afraid.

1350
01:38:05,910 --> 01:38:06,840
失陪一下
Entschuldigen Sie mich.

1351
01:38:13,530 --> 01:38:18,530
我知道你很长时间不说德语了
Ich bin mir bewusst, Sie haben nicht Deutsch gesprochen in einer langen Weile.

1352
01:38:22,610 --> 01:38:25,360
所以我就说慢点
Also werde ich langsam zu sprechen.

1353
01:38:30,830 --> 01:38:35,550
我只说德语是怕坎迪的人听到我们的谈话
Ich bin nur Deutsch zu sprechen, um Sie jetzt auf jeden Fall Candie Leute h?ren uns.

1354
01:38:41,810 --> 01:38:42,930
抱歉
Pardon.

1355
01:38:46,390 --> 01:38:48,370
你真漂亮
Wie sch?n du bist.

1356
01:38:50,790 --> 01:38:51,890
谢谢
Danke.

1357
01:39:01,330 --> 01:39:05,670
我本人和一个我们都认识的朋友
Myself und ein gemeinsamer Freund von uns

1358
01:39:06,830 --> 01:39:09,350
克服了很多困难
haben eine Menge Mühe gegeben

1359
01:39:09,350 --> 01:39:12,540
也赶了很多路
und ritt eine Menge von Meilen

1360
01:39:13,190 --> 01:39:15,020
就是为了找到你  小姐
um Sie zu finden, Fr?ulein

1361
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:19,040
为了把你救出去
um dich zu retten.

1362
01:39:20,930 --> 01:39:22,640
请喝吧
Bitte trinken.

1363
01:39:26,630 --> 01:39:30,770
这是我和我们那个朋友的共同愿望
Jetzt ist es mir und unseren gemeinsamen Freunden Absicht

1364
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:33,310
把你永远地带离这里
dich von hier ewig dauern.

1365
01:39:33,530 --> 01:39:35,460
我没有朋友
Ich habe noch keine Freunde.

1366
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:40,040
你有的
Ja, Sie haben ein.

1367
01:39:40,940 --> 01:39:41,720
是谁
Wer?

1368
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:44,720
暂时不能说
Ich kann Ihnen nicht sagen.

1369
01:39:47,230 --> 01:39:51,650
我们这位朋友喜欢戏剧性的见面场景
Unser gemeinsamer Freund hat ein Gespür für das Dramatische.

1370
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:55,510
这位朋友现在在哪
Wo ist das?

1371
01:39:58,130 --> 01:40:00,250
就站在那扇门后面
Stehend direkt hinter dieser Tür.

1372
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:10,580
答应我别叫出声来
Versprich mir, dass du nicht schreien?

1373
01:40:14,860 --> 01:40:18,490
说  我保证
Sprich: "Ich verspreche".

1374
01:40:20,630 --> 01:40:22,310
我保证
Ich verspreche.

1375
01:40:37,450 --> 01:40:38,850
你好  小调皮鬼
Hey Little Trouble Maker.

1376
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:50,440
你还真是巧舌如簧
You silver tongued devil you.

1377
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:53,260
动作快点姑娘们
Hurry up, girl.

1378
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:55,640
不不不  他们今晚要喝酒
No, no, no. They'll drink tonight.

1379
01:40:55,640 --> 01:40:58,560
到楼下去拿坎迪先生的藏酒
Go downstairs and get the big...Monsieur Candie

1380
01:40:58,560 --> 01:40:59,980
看看你这大肥屁股
Look at your big pretty ass.

1381
01:41:00,050 --> 01:41:01,720
你明明很喜欢
You know you like it.

1382
01:41:01,990 --> 01:41:04,100
没错  因为你就是要投我所好
Yes. Because you know what I like.

1383
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:08,380
坎迪先生
Look Monsieur Candie,

1384
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:12,230
他们都很不错  这点不用怀疑
they were all fine specimens, no doubt about it.

1385
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:15,420
但目前来看最好的三个是
But the best three, by far, were:

1386
01:41:15,750 --> 01:41:17,000
桑普森
Sampson...

1387
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:19,600
-叫什么来着  -戈尔迪
- Well, what's his name again? - Goldie.

1388
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,870
戈尔迪  还有爱斯基摩人乔伊
Goldie... and Eskimo Joe.

1389
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:25,760
对了  为什么他会叫爱斯基摩人乔伊
By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?

1390
01:41:25,820 --> 01:41:29,230
永远搞不懂黑鬼们稀奇古怪的诨名哪来的
Oh, you never know how these nigger nicknames get started.

1391
01:41:29,350 --> 01:41:30,600
他原名乔伊
His name was Joe,

1392
01:41:30,610 --> 01:41:32,870
也许有天他突然说自己很冷  谁知道呢
maybe one day he said he was cold, who knows?

1393
01:41:36,010 --> 01:41:37,250
不管他了
Well, regardless,

1394
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:39,400
桑普森是你的种子选手
Sampson's your best,

1395
01:41:39,630 --> 01:41:40,990
我们都知道的
we all know that,

1396
01:41:41,370 --> 01:41:43,740
你死也不卖  原因显而易见
you will never sell him, and I can see why,

1397
01:41:43,740 --> 01:41:45,110
他是最好的
he's a champion.

1398
01:41:45,190 --> 01:41:48,740
这三个都是最好的
Hm-hm-hm! All three are champions.

1399
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:51,120
桑普森才是最好的
Sampson's champion.

1400
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:53,820
另外两个只能说很不错
Them other two pretty good.

1401
01:41:54,980 --> 01:41:56,550
卡尔文  那个黑鬼  你怎么能
Calvin, what that nigger- you let-

1402
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:57,770
没事的  没事的
That's alright, that's alright.

1403
01:41:57,840 --> 01:41:59,800
坎迪先生  希望您理解
You have to understand Monsieur Candie,

1404
01:41:59,910 --> 01:42:03,600
虽然得承认在曼丁果这一行我还是个新手
while admittedly a neophyte in the nigger fight game,

1405
01:42:03,670 --> 01:42:05,220
不过我对欧洲的巡回马戏团
I do have a little bit of a

1406
01:42:05,220 --> 01:42:07,740
有过一些了解
background in the European traveling circus.

1407
01:42:07,790 --> 01:42:09,140
是吗
Is that right?

1408
01:42:09,420 --> 01:42:13,450
因此  我很清楚怎么提高观赏性
Hence... I have big ideas when it comes to presentation.

1409
01:42:14,770 --> 01:42:17,160
我需要的不仅仅是一个大块头黑人
I need something more than just a big nigger.

1410
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:21,230
他还得有些  派头
He needs to have... panache.

1411
01:42:21,380 --> 01:42:23,850
-要有什么什么什么  -派头
- Need to have what what what? - Panache, hum...

1412
01:42:24,910 --> 01:42:27,570
-懂得如何作秀  -作秀  没错
- A sense of showmanship! - Showmanship, yes.

1413
01:42:27,610 --> 01:42:31,350
我要把他包装成黑人海格力斯
I want to be able to bill him him as the "Black Hercules".

1414
01:42:27,610 --> 01:42:31,350
希腊神话中的大力神

1415
01:42:32,710 --> 01:42:34,490
黑人海格力斯  真绝
Black Hercules, isn't that clever?

1416
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:36,000
听起来更狠
More like niggerly.

1417
01:42:37,690 --> 01:42:39,600
我再重复一遍我说过的话
I said, and I quote:

1418
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:45,300
理想的黑人我愿意出高价
"I would pay top dollar for the Right Nigger".

1419
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:49,940
我也不是说爱斯基摩人乔伊不理想
Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger per se...

1420
01:42:50,940 --> 01:42:53,480
但他真的那么好吗
but is he right as rain?

1421
01:42:54,810 --> 01:42:57,990
舒尔茨医生  我希望你知道
Dr. Schultz, I will have you know,

1422
01:42:58,060 --> 01:43:01,190
在曼丁果界没有人比我
there is no one in the nigger fight game that appreciates

1423
01:43:01,210 --> 01:43:04,430
卡尔文・坎迪更看重观赏性了
the value of showmanship more than Monsieur Calvin J. Candie.

1424
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:05,440
没人比得上
Nobody.

1425
01:43:05,690 --> 01:43:06,980
但我们不该忘了曼丁果
But one must not forget the

1426
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:09,180
最重要的一点是什么
most important thing in the nigger fight game.

1427
01:43:09,290 --> 01:43:12,340
那就是你的黑人能不能打赢比赛
And that is a nigger that can win fights.

1428
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:14,610
你得把这点排在第一
Now that should be your first,

1429
01:43:14,610 --> 01:43:16,990
第二  第三  第四  第五位
second, third, four, and fifth concern.

1430
01:43:17,130 --> 01:43:19,380
等你确定能也确实做到了这点之后
Now after you have that, and you know you have that,

1431
01:43:19,430 --> 01:43:22,580
才该去考虑那些花里胡哨的包装
then you can start to implement a grand design.

1432
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:26,100
换句话说  要主次分明
In other words, first thing is first.

1433
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:28,280
主次分明
First thing is first.

1434
01:43:36,710 --> 01:43:39,110
你们俩挺合得来啊
I see you two gettin' on.

1435
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:41,320
相处甚欢
Famously.

1436
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:44,310
坎迪先生  你一定想象不出
Oh Monsieur Candie, you can't imagine what it's like

1437
01:43:44,310 --> 01:43:47,750
四年不说母语是什么感觉
not to hear you native tongue in four years.

1438
01:43:48,010 --> 01:43:50,670
可不是  在波士顿待两周都无法想象
Well hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.

1439
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:55,490
在波士顿待两周  是你的  老天
Two weeks in Boston, oh that's your- oh man!

1440
01:43:57,070 --> 01:43:58,630
在波士顿待两周
Ah, two weeks in Boston!

1441
01:43:58,990 --> 01:44:03,990
真是无法用语言表达能用母语交流的开心
I can't express the joy I felt conversing in my mother tongue.

1442
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:08,940
何况希尔迪是个很魅力无穷的交谈对象
And Hildi is a charming conversation companion.

1443
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:11,000
你可要小心  舒尔茨医生
Ah be careful now Doctor Schultz,

1444
01:44:11,170 --> 01:44:13,800
你都快爱上黑人了
you might have caught yourself a little dose of Nigella.

1445
01:44:14,130 --> 01:44:16,500
爱上黑人可是会一发不可收拾啊
Nigella's a powerful emotion, boy.

1446
01:44:16,550 --> 01:44:18,120
就像一潭黑泥
It's like a pool of black tar,

1447
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:20,000
让你深陷其中  无法自拔
once it catches your ass, you can't.

1448
01:44:20,070 --> 01:44:21,870
没错  无法自拔
Yessir, you can't.

1449
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:24,920
我不太明白  医生
I don't know doctor,

1450
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:27,720
尽管您用德语说了那么多甜言蜜语
you can lay on all the German sweet talk you want,

1451
01:44:27,770 --> 01:44:30,530
不过似乎这小丫头是看上姜戈了
but it looks like this pony's got big eyes for Django.

1452
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:36,590
当然了
Well... naturally, it is the

1453
01:44:36,590 --> 01:44:40,290
吸引她的是猛禽
soaring eagle that attracts her attention,

1454
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:42,780
而不是我这样的雏鸡
not the plucked chicken.

1455
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,640
舒尔茨医生  别这么妄自菲薄
Dr. Schultz, don't be so down on yourself,

1456
01:44:46,660 --> 01:44:48,370
您可是个标准的欧洲绅士
you are quite a dapper European gentleman.

1457
01:44:48,390 --> 01:44:49,610
要把这些擦干净
You gotta clean this,

1458
01:44:49,610 --> 01:44:51,670
你得把手伸进去  听到了没有
you got to put your elbow in this, this is, do you hear me...

1459
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:54,120
你跟那个黑鬼认识  是吗
You know that nigger, don't ya?

1460
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,210
-谁  -谁
- Who? - Who?

1461
01:44:56,290 --> 01:44:59,050
别糊弄我  你知道我在说什么
Don't who me bitch, you know who I'm talking about!?

1462
01:45:01,070 --> 01:45:02,360
桌子上那个吗
At the table?

1463
01:45:03,290 --> 01:45:04,720
我不认识
I don't know him.

1464
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:06,100
你不认识
You don't know him?

1465
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:07,650
没错
No.

1466
01:45:07,870 --> 01:45:09,050
没错什么
No what?

1467
01:45:09,330 --> 01:45:10,740
没错  先生
No sir.

1468
01:45:15,540 --> 01:45:17,420
你不会骗我的  是不是
You wouldn't lie to me now, would you?

1469
01:45:24,700 --> 01:45:27,610
既然你坚持这么说
If- if you say so.

1470
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,320
爱斯基摩人乔伊毫无疑问是个不错的苗子
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger, no doubt about it.

1471
01:45:39,180 --> 01:45:40,400
不过如果要我买的话
But if it was my money...

1472
01:45:42,050 --> 01:45:44,100
我不会花一万二买他
I wouldn't pay no twelve thousand dollars for him.

1473
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:46,290
那你会出多少
What would your price be?

1474
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:48,870
如果出手够大方的话
Well, if I was inclined to be generous,

1475
01:45:48,940 --> 01:45:52,170
虽然我不知道为什么要出手大方
and I don't know why I would be inclined to be generous...

1476
01:45:53,290 --> 01:45:56,830
差不多  9千吧
nine thousand... maybe.

1477
01:45:57,720 --> 01:45:59,120
舒尔茨医生
Dr. Schultz...

1478
01:45:59,700 --> 01:46:03,640
希望您搞清楚这场交易到底是怎么回事
Let me reclarify how this whole negotiation came about.

1479
01:46:03,980 --> 01:46:06,230
并不是我找到您说要卖黑奴
You see, it wasn't me who came to you to sell a nigger,

1480
01:46:06,250 --> 01:46:07,030
当然不是了
Sure, it wasn't.

1481
01:46:07,050 --> 01:46:09,160
是您来找我买
It was you who approached me to buy one.

1482
01:46:09,180 --> 01:46:10,040
没错
Sure it was.

1483
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:12,830
这个机灵小子提出9千的价格
Now that nine thousand dollar figure Bright Boy was banding about,

1484
01:46:12,850 --> 01:46:14,100
也并不离谱
that ain't too far off from right,

1485
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:15,760
不过如果我用这个价格卖爱斯基摩人乔伊
and if I wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that,

1486
01:46:15,780 --> 01:46:17,530
只要想卖就能卖出去
I could do so any day of the week.

1487
01:46:17,550 --> 01:46:18,560
想卖就能卖
Any day.

1488
01:46:18,980 --> 01:46:21,100
但就像您在格林维尔说的
But like you said in Greenville doctor,

1489
01:46:21,290 --> 01:46:22,960
我不想卖
I don't wanna sell 'em.

1490
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:26,530
是您开出了一万二的天价
It was only your ridiculous offer

1491
01:46:26,550 --> 01:46:29,830
我才想过要考虑一下
of twelve thousand dollars that made me even consider it.

1492
01:46:39,110 --> 01:46:43,310
坎迪先生  您确实很会说服人
You know Monsieur Candie, you do possess the power of persuasion.

1493
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:50,040
这生意为何不做呢  坎迪先生  成交
Why not, Monsieur Candie, you have a deal,

1494
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:52,130
一万二买爱斯基摩人乔伊
Eskimo Joe, twelve thousand dollars!

1495
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:55,390
太棒了  医生  明智的决定
Hurray, doctor, hurray, and a wise decision, that is!

1496
01:46:55,450 --> 01:46:58,860
不过  这笔钱可不是小数目
However, that is a tremendous amount of money.

1497
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:02,330
您这边有莫盖尔先生  我也有个律师
And the way you have your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer,

1498
01:47:02,380 --> 01:47:04,370
图特勒  一个小气鬼
a persnickety man named Tuttle,

1499
01:47:04,510 --> 01:47:07,690
在我花这么大一笔钱买一个人之前
And I would need my Mr. Tuttle to draw up a legal contract

1500
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:09,270
我要叫我的律师起草一份正式合同
before I'd feel comfortable

1501
01:47:09,270 --> 01:47:11,700
好让我觉得安心
exchanging that amount of money for flesh.

1502
01:47:11,970 --> 01:47:13,320
另外我还想请个医生
Not to mention having Eskimo Joe

1503
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:15,390
给爱斯基摩人乔伊做些检查
examined by a physician of my choosing.

1504
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:16,840
这是当然
Naturally.

1505
01:47:16,870 --> 01:47:21,090
我看我差不多

1508
01:47:28,850 --> 01:47:29,970
他跟你的莫盖尔先生可以
And then my Mr. Tuttle and your Mr. Moguy can

1509
01:47:29,980 --> 01:47:32,340
好好商讨下合同的细节

1510
01:47:33,470 --> 01:47:36,330
棒极了  医生  棒极了

1511
01:47:37,150 --> 01:47:38,550
先生们

1512
01:47:39,460 --> 01:47:40,920
请允许我

1513
01:47:43,690 --> 01:47:47,460
敬爱斯基摩人乔伊  或者我们可以叫他
to Eskimo Joe. Or, shall we call him

1514
01:47:47,770 --> 01:47:49,590
黑人海格力斯

1515
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:51,650
敬黑人海格力斯
To the Black Hercules.

1516
01:47:51,770 --> 01:47:53,010
黑人海格力斯
The Black Hercules!

1517
01:47:53,270 --> 01:47:54,770
黑人海格力斯
The Black Hercules...

1518
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:56,100
说的没错  医生
You was right, Doctor,

1519
01:47:56,100 --> 01:47:58,060
起个那种名字的确能卖个好价钱
that name do help pay an ass.

1520
01:48:00,380 --> 01:48:01,780
希尔迪
Hildi...

1521
01:48:02,210 --> 01:48:03,450
我没酒了
I'm outta drink, girl.

1522
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:08,040
希尔迪
So Hildi...

1523
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:10,950
在大场面的餐桌上服侍的感觉怎么样
how you like servin' at the big table in the big house, huh?

1524
01:48:11,950 --> 01:48:14,680
坎迪先生问你话就得回答
When Monsieur Candie talk to you, you answers.

1525
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:17,120
我觉得很不错  坎迪先生
I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.

1526
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:20,210
这比你睡在那个箱子里
It's a lot better than sizzling in that hot box,

1527
01:48:20,230 --> 01:48:22,630
还有穿过荆棘丛好受多了吧
or draggin' your ass through a bramble bush.

1528
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:23,860
不过可能比不上
Maybe it's not quite as much

1529
01:48:23,860 --> 01:48:25,720
服侍那些曼丁果角斗士
fun as getting the pleasure o' the mandingos,

1530
01:48:25,750 --> 01:48:27,650
-是吧甜心  -她挺喜欢他们的
- Huh sugar babe? - Hmm oh, she like them new.

1531

-比如桑普森  -是的
- Like Sampson, huh? - Yessir.

1532
01:48:30,540 --> 01:48:32,210
坎迪先生
You know Monsieur Candie,

1533
01:48:32,230 --> 01:48:33,590
这位医生说不定有兴趣
the doctor here might be

1534
01:48:33,590 --> 01:48:35,920
看看希尔迪的裸背
interested in seein' Hildi's peeled back,

1535
01:48:35,940 --> 01:48:39,230
毕竟他们那里也没什么黑鬼
since how they don't have many niggers where he come from.

1536
01:48:39,290 --> 01:48:40,410
舒尔茨医生
Dr. Schultz,

1537
01:48:40,410 --> 01:48:42,030
你刚才跟希尔迪单独相处的时候
when you was alone with Hildi here,

1538
01:48:42,050 --> 01:48:45,250
是只说说德语  还是把她衣服也脱了
did- didja just speak German, or did ya git her clothes off?

1539
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:47,080
没有  我们就是聊聊天
No, we just talked and...

1540
01:48:47,130 --> 01:48:49,140
那就是没看过她的后背了
Oh so- so you haven't seen her back?

1541
01:48:49,330 --> 01:48:50,320
我没有
I haven't...

1542
01:48:50,430 --> 01:48:52,190
不不不  史蒂芬说的有道理
No no no, now Steven's right,

1543
01:48:52,190 --> 01:48:53,520
你会感兴趣的
you might find this interesting.

1544
01:48:53,580 --> 01:48:55,270
希尔迪  把你的裙子脱了
Hildi, com'on take off your dress,

1545
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:57,210
给舒尔茨医生看看你的后背  快点

1546
01:48:57,250 --> 01:49:01,260
卡尔文  我刚刚才把她打扮好
Uh, Calvin, I just got her all dressed up and looking nice.

1547
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:02,520
但是  劳拉・莉
But... Lara Lee,

1548
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:04,350
舒尔茨医生从杜塞尔多夫远道而来
Dr. Schultz is from Dusseldorf,

1549
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:04,350
德国城市  位于莱茵河畔

1550
01:49:04,350 --> 01:49:05,780
那边没什么黑鬼
they don't got niggers there.

1551
01:49:05,990 --> 01:49:07,470
他是个医生
He's a man of medicine.

1552
01:49:07,630 --> 01:49:10,530
他一定很有兴趣看看黑鬼对疼痛的忍耐力
I'm sure it would fascinate him, the niggers endurance for pain.

1553
01:49:10,630 --> 01:49:12,650
这些黑鬼很能挨  舒尔茨医生
These niggers are tough Dr. Schultz,

1554
01:49:12,650 --> 01:49:14,080
毋庸置疑
no doubt about it.

1555
01:49:14,170 --> 01:49:16,590
希尔达背上有差不多四条鞭痕
Hilda's got somethin' like four lashes on her back.

1556
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:19,050
要是换成劳拉・莉挨个一下就不行了
Lara Lee just get one she lose her goddamn mind.

1557
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:21,090
看看  医生  是不是跟画作一样  看看
Look a' that, doctor, it's like a painting, look at that.

1558
01:49:21,140 --> 01:49:22,190
卡尔文
Calvin!

1559
01:49:23,090 --> 01:49:23,890
我们正在用餐
We are eating,

1560
01:49:23,890 --> 01:49:26,180
没人想看她伤痕累累的后背
and no one wanna look at her whipped up back!

1561
01:49:28,190 --> 01:49:30,240
好  好  好好好好
Fine. Fine, fine fine fine…

1562
01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:32,980
等吃完饭再看  史蒂芬  等吃完饭
After the dinner, Steven. After dinner.

1563
01:49:34,210 --> 01:49:35,710
等会喝白兰地的时候再看  先生们
During the brandies, gentlemen. Uh?

1564
01:49:42,140 --> 01:49:44,240
科拉  把她带走
Cora, come get this girl!

1565
01:49:47,190 --> 01:49:49,490
-衣服都弄乱了  -夫人
- She all messed. - Yes ma'am?

1566
01:49:49,950 --> 01:49:51,960
你们在干什么
Oh! What are you all done?

1567
01:49:52,010 --> 01:49:54,670
我刚刚帮你穿好  过来吧  过来
I just got you done, now come over, here!

1568
01:50:01,070 --> 01:50:02,920
史蒂芬对你没有好感
Baby, you're on Steven's bad side,

1569
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:04,980
那就别总招惹他了
when you need to be on his blind side.

1570
01:50:05,030 --> 01:50:07,160
你不是说你不认识他吗
You said you ain't know him?

1571
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:14,450
我刚才说  你不是说你不认识他吗
I said... you said you ain't know him.

1572
01:50:16,310 --> 01:50:17,870
我确实不认识
I don't.

1573
01:50:18,230 --> 01:50:19,550
你认识
Yes you do.

1574
01:50:21,730 --> 01:50:22,980
史蒂芬先生
Mister Steven...

1575
01:50:24,390 --> 01:50:25,710
我不认识他
I don't.

1576
01:50:25,900 --> 01:50:27,700
为什么对我撒谎
Why is you lyin' to me?

1577
01:50:30,340 --> 01:50:31,670
我没有
I ain't.

1578
01:50:32,150 --> 01:50:34,110
那你为什么哭
Then why is you crying?

1579
01:50:35,010 --> 01:50:36,380
你吓到我了
You scarin' me.

1580
01:50:36,620 --> 01:50:38,420
我怎么吓到你了
Why is I'm scarin' you?

1581
01:50:39,250 --> 01:50:40,950
因为你很可怕
Because you scary.

1582
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:46,520
今天下午用德语跟希尔迪交谈
To speak German this afternoon with Hildi,

1583
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:49,070
简直让我的倍感充实
was positively soul enriching.

1584
01:50:49,430 --> 01:50:51,640
医生  这话真暖心
Oh, doctor. That warms my heart.

1585
01:50:52,130 --> 01:50:54,860
你给我坐在椅子上
You stay in that chair.

1586
01:51:00,440 --> 01:51:05,040
你之前提过说想卖掉希尔迪
You indicated earlier you'd be willing to part with Hildi.

1587
01:51:05,190 --> 01:51:07,950
没错  正是
Oh yes. Yesiree Bob I did.

1588
01:51:09,860 --> 01:51:13,750
既然如此  请允许我
In that case... allow me...

1589
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:15,700
再提一个请求
to propose another proposition.

1590
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:16,950
您请讲
I'm all ears.

1591
01:51:17,180 --> 01:51:19,000
快点  该死的
Hurry up, goddammit!

1592
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:21,970
-坎迪先生  -史蒂芬
- Monsieur Candie- - Steven!

1593
01:51:22,430 --> 01:51:24,870
你打断了舒尔茨医生的话
You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here!

1594
01:51:25,810 --> 01:51:28,840
抱歉舒尔茨医生
Uhm... sorry doctor Schultz,

1595
01:51:28,850 --> 01:51:30,940
我最近耳朵不太好使
my ears ain't worth a damn these days.

1596
01:51:32,300 --> 01:51:35,580
坎迪先生  能不能到厨房跟你说几句话
Monsieur Candie, could I get a word with you in the kitchen.

1597
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:38,480
你是说要我离座吗
You mean get up outta my chair?

1598
01:51:38,610 --> 01:51:40,410
如果您愿意的话
If you could manage it.

1599
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:41,840
怎么了
Why?

1600
01:51:42,130 --> 01:51:43,660
是甜品的事
It's about dessert.

1601
01:51:43,770 --> 01:51:45,390
甜品怎么了
What about dessert?

1602
01:51:45,890 --> 01:51:48,550
我希望能私下里说
I'd rather discuss that in private.

1603
01:51:48,630 --> 01:51:50,690
不就是个蛋糕吗
We're havin' white cake.

1604
01:51:50,930 --> 01:51:53,430
这都能出什么岔子吗
What sort of melodrama could be brewing back there?

1605
01:51:53,580 --> 01:51:57,850
您说的是坎迪先生  我这就去自己处理
You right Monsieur Candie, you right, I'll handle it myself.

1606
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,420
去书房找我
Meet me in the library.

1607
01:51:59,750 --> 01:52:03,070
我只是不明白您为什么不能亲自过去看看
I just can't understand why you won't come talk to the evening,

1608
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:04,980
她搞的乱七八糟的  到时候又怪我
she get fucked up 'round here, you blame me.

1609
01:52:05,070 --> 01:52:06,890
行了行了  史蒂芬  我
Fine, fine friend Steven, I...

1610
01:52:08,100 --> 01:52:09,660
我马上就来
I will be along momentarily.

1611
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:11,520
好的  先生
Yessir.

1612
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:13,480
那么
Well,

1613
01:52:14,170 --> 01:52:15,130
先生们
gentlemen...

1614
01:52:15,370 --> 01:52:18,170
如您所见  尽管他们厨艺不错
as you can see, talented as they are no doubt in the kitchen,

1615
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:21,960
但有时候还是需要人指导
from time to time... adult supervision is required.

1616
01:52:24,860 --> 01:52:26,820
我失陪一下
If you'll excuse me a moment.

1617
01:52:32,780 --> 01:52:34,880
晚餐可以撤了
You may clear the dinner service.

1618
01:52:38,910 --> 01:52:39,810
动作快点  姑娘们
Hurry up girl.

1619
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:41,370
舒尔茨医生
So Dr. Schultz...

1620
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:44,620
不如给我们多讲讲马戏团的事吧
Why don't you regal us with the tale of the circus?

1621
01:52:45,410 --> 01:52:47,030
马戏团吗
The circus!

1622
01:52:54,290 --> 01:52:56,090
怎么回事
What is the matter?

1623
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:05,950
那两个混蛋根本不是来买曼丁果人的
Them motherfuckers ain't here to buy no mandingos.

1624
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:08,050
他们想把那姑娘买走
They wants that girl.

1625
01:53:10,310 --> 01:53:13,050
史蒂芬  你胡扯什么
Steven, what the hell are you talkin' about, hm?

1626
01:53:13,190 --> 01:53:16,470
他们把你耍得团团转  我就是这意思
They playin' your ass for a fool, that what I'm talkin' bout.

1627
01:53:16,750 --> 01:53:20,120
他们来这儿不是为了什么肌肉斗士
They ain't here for no muscle bound jimmie,

1628
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:22,270
而是为了那个姑娘
they here for that girl.

1629
01:53:22,710 --> 01:53:25,270
什么  哪个姑娘  希尔迪吗
What... what girl. What... Hildi?

1630
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:27,580
没错  希尔迪  她跟姜戈
Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django?

1631
01:53:27,900 --> 01:53:30,010
那两个黑鬼互相认识
Them niggers know each other.

1632
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,710
他  他刚买了爱斯基摩人乔伊
He... he just bought Eskimo Joe.

1633
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:34,050
他付钱了吗
Did he give you any money?

1634
01:53:34,110 --> 01:53:35,200
没有  还没有  但是他们会
No, not yet, but they go...

1635
01:53:35,220 --> 01:53:37,720
那他们就什么都没买  至少目前是这样
Then he didn't buy diddly, not yet no how.

1636
01:53:37,910 --> 01:53:39,750
但是就在我打断他的时候
But he's just about to buy

1637
01:53:39,750 --> 01:53:43,150
他正打算买下此行的目标
who he come here to buy, when I interrupted him.

1638
01:53:43,660 --> 01:53:46,330
谢谢你史蒂芬  不客气卡尔文
Thank you Steven. You're welcome Calvin.

1639
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:54,210
你  你是怎么知道这些的
Whe- Where you gettin' all this?

1640
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,480
他们干嘛要为了一个背上被打成那样
Why would they go through all that trouble for a nigger with a...

1641
01:53:57,490 --> 01:53:59,910
300块都不值的黑鬼费尽心思
with a chewed up back, ain't worth three hundred dollars?

1642
01:54:00,090 --> 01:54:03,730
因为那个黑鬼姜戈跟希尔迪相爱
They're doin' it cause that nigger Django's in love with Hildi.

1643
01:54:04,260 --> 01:54:05,930
可能是他老婆
She probably his wife.

1644
01:54:06,170 --> 01:54:07,740
至于为什么那个德国人要他妈在意
Now, why that German give a fuck

1645
01:54:07,740 --> 01:54:10,060
那个傲慢的贱种爱上谁了
who that uppity son-of-a-bitch is in love with,

1646
01:54:10,070 --> 01:54:12,270
我还真不知道
I'm sure I don't know.

1647
01:54:15,030 --> 01:54:16,910
如果她才是他们想买的人
If she's who they want...

1648
01:54:17,330 --> 01:54:21,470
为什么还要扯上什么曼丁果人的破事
why this whole... snake oil pitch about mandingos in?

1649
01:54:21,830 --> 01:54:24,810
你绝对不会理会300块钱
You wouldn't pay no never mind into three hundred dollar.

1650
01:54:25,670 --> 01:54:27,140
但如果是一万二呢
But that twelve thousand?

1651
01:54:28,450 --> 01:54:30,640
你就会对他们很客气了  不是吗
That made you real friendly now, didn'it?

1652
01:54:33,630 --> 01:54:35,030
的确是这样
Yes it did.

1653
01:54:38,740 --> 01:54:39,870
他老婆是吗
His wife, uh?

1654
01:54:44,650 --> 01:54:46,500
如果是条蛇
If it had been a snake...

1655
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:48,290
我们可就被咬了
we would have beat'em.

1656
01:54:51,420 --> 01:54:56,280
这两个  浪费我时间的
Those lyin'... goddamn time...

1657
01:54:56,440 --> 01:54:59,970
王八蛋
wastin' sonsabitches.

1658
01:55:02,220 --> 01:55:03,780
王八蛋
Sonsabitches!

1659
01:55:03,910 --> 01:55:04,990
在新奥尔良
Out of New Orleans,

1660
01:55:05,170 --> 01:55:08,850
所以我也练习过好几种戏剧
so I had quite a bit of practice with... theater types.

1661
01:55:10,090 --> 01:55:11,740
你终于来了
Oh there you are!

1662
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:13,100
我都要以为
I was beginning to think

1663
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:15,420
你跟那个老头子私奔去了
that you and that old crow ran off together.

1664
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:18,830
那可要遗臭万年了  是吧
That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?

1665
01:55:19,090 --> 01:55:20,110
劳拉・莉
Lara Lee...

1666
01:55:20,350 --> 01:55:21,970
我刚才从窗户里看到
I was just lookin' out the big window.

1667
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:23,970
比利・克拉什在外面跟几个黑奴贩
Billy Crash is out there dealin' with some

1668
01:55:23,970 --> 01:55:26,360
做马匹生意
shady slaver try to sell a passel of ponys,

1669
01:55:26,370 --> 01:55:29,610
你能不能帮个忙出去帮我盯着点
would you be a dear and go out there give them gals an eyeball.

1670
01:55:30,500 --> 01:55:33,300
-当然可以  弟弟  -谢谢你  亲爱的
- Of course, brother. - Thank you, darling.

1671
01:55:45,940 --> 01:55:49,360
真是生意兴隆
Okay. Business never sleeps.

1672
01:55:51,650 --> 01:55:53,050
对了
A propos...

1673
01:55:53,200 --> 01:55:54,990
您刚才出去之前  我们正在
before your exit, we were

1674
01:55:54,990 --> 01:55:58,930
商议买布鲁姆希尔达的事情
discussing the possibility of my purchasing Broomhilda.

1675
01:55:59,020 --> 01:56:01,300
没错  我们是在讨论这个
Ah yes! Yes we were doctor.

1676
01:56:02,020 --> 01:56:04,380
我们等会儿再继续讨论
And we will again... in a moment.

1677
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:22,580
这位小朋友是谁
Who is your little friend?

1678
01:56:27,750 --> 01:56:29,150
这是本
This is Ben...

1679
01:56:30,710 --> 01:56:35,240
他在这里干了好多年管家
He's a Ol'Joe that... lived around here for a long time.

1680
01:56:35,810 --> 01:56:37,910
真的是好多好多年
And I do mean a long damn time.

1681
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:40,700
本在这里
Well Ben here...

1682
01:56:41,350 --> 01:56:43,170
照顾过我爸爸
took care of my daddy...

1683
01:56:43,730 --> 01:56:45,550
还有我爷爷
and my daddy's daddy...

1684
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:48,270
直到有天他们都去世了
till the open kill doe who one day...

1685
01:56:51,370 --> 01:56:52,850
本也照顾过我
Ben took care o'me.

1686
01:56:55,630 --> 01:56:59,530
作为密西西比大型种植园园主的儿子
Growin'up the son of a... of a huge plantation owner in Mississippi

1687
01:56:59,550 --> 01:57:03,290
一个白人孩子会接触到
puts a white men in contact with

1688
01:57:03,290 --> 01:57:05,540
很多黑人面孔
a whole lot of black faces.

1689
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:09,630
我整个一生都在这里度过
I spent my whole life here...

1690
01:57:09,630 --> 01:57:12,330
就在这里  坎迪庄园
right here... in Candyland...

1691
01:57:13,700 --> 01:57:17,230
周围全是黑人
surrounded... by black faces.

1692
01:57:19,540 --> 01:57:22,610
每天从早到晚都能见到他们
And seein' them ev'ry day, day in day out, I...

1693
01:57:23,210 --> 01:57:24,910
我只有一个疑问
I only had one question.

1694
01:57:28,980 --> 01:57:30,620
为什么他们不把我们杀了
Why don't they kill us?

1695
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:36,650
就在门廊那里
Now right up there on that porch...

1696
01:57:37,070 --> 01:57:39,560
老本帮我爸爸刮了50年胡子
three times a week for fifty years,

1697
01:57:39,700 --> 01:57:44,260
每周要刮3次
Ol'Ben here... would shave my Daddy with a straight razor.

1698
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,330
如果我是老本
Now... if I was Ol'Ben,

1699
01:57:47,330 --> 01:57:50,120
我会把我爸的喉咙割断
I would have cut my Daddy's goddamn throat,

1700
01:57:50,180 --> 01:57:53,920
而且都用不着等上50年
and it wouldn't have taken me no fifty years to do it neither.

1701
01:57:56,270 --> 01:57:57,680
但他从来没有这样做
But he never did.

1702
01:57:59,530 --> 01:58:00,650
为什么呢
Why not?

1703
01:58:02,180 --> 01:58:05,810
物候学
You see... the science of phenology

1704
01:58:06,870 --> 01:58:10,210
是理解两个人种之间
is crucial to understandin' the

1705
01:58:10,210 --> 01:58:12,070
差异的关键
separation about two species.

1706
01:58:13,870 --> 01:58:16,270
在这个非洲人的颅骨里
In the skull of the African here...

1707
01:58:17,850 --> 01:58:20,220
控制服从思想的那块区域
the area associated with submissiveness

1708
01:58:20,290 --> 01:58:22,290
比这个地球上的任何人类
is larger than any human or

1709
01:58:22,290 --> 01:58:25,550
或者任何亚种人类都要大
any other sub human species on planet earth.

1710
01:58:41,490 --> 01:58:43,310
如果你检查一下
If you examine...

1711
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:46,690
颅骨的这一块
this peace of skull here...

1712
01:58:52,930 --> 01:58:56,980
你会发现有3个明显的凹陷
you'll notice three distinct dimples.

1713
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:03,570
这里  这里  还有这里
Here... here... and here.

1714
01:59:04,010 --> 01:59:07,180
如果我拿着的是
Now... If I was holding a skull

1715
01:59:07,180 --> 01:59:10,210
艾萨克・牛顿或者伽利略的颅骨
of a- of a... of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,

1716
01:59:10,610 --> 01:59:12,120
这3块凹陷将会
these three dimples would be

1717
01:59:12,120 --> 01:59:16,620
位于控制创造性的那块区域
found in the area o'the skull most associated with... creativity.

1718
01:59:17,220 --> 01:59:19,320
可惜这只是老本的颅骨
But this' the skull of Ol'Ben.

1719
01:59:20,030 --> 01:59:23,910
老本的颅骨  与天才无关
And in the skull of Ol'Ben, unburden by genius,

1720
01:59:24,510 --> 01:59:25,990
这三块凹陷位于
these three dimples exist

1721
01:59:25,990 --> 01:59:30,990
控制奴性的那块区域
in the area of the skull most associated with... servility.

1722
01:59:32,390 --> 01:59:33,890
机灵小子
Now Bright Boy...

1723
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:37,000
我承认你非常聪明
I will admit you are pretty clever.

1724
01:59:39,670 --> 01:59:41,340
不过如果我用这把锤子
But if I took this hammer here

1725
01:59:43,750 --> 01:59:45,750
敲开你的颅骨
and I bashed it in your skull,

1726
01:59:47,060 --> 01:59:49,440
你大脑中凹陷的位置会跟这些一样
you would have the same three dimples...

1727
01:59:50,170 --> 01:59:55,160
跟老本一样  在同一个地方
in the same place... as Ol'Ben.

1728
01:59:57,420 --> 01:59:59,910
给我把手都放在桌子上
Now lay your palms flat on the table top!

1729
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,050
要是你们敢把手从桌上拿开
If you lift those palms off that turtle shell table top,

1730
02:00:03,100 --> 02:00:06,340
布奇先生的子弹可不认人
Mr. Butch is gonna let loose with both barrels of that sawed off!

1731
02:00:07,450 --> 02:00:08,550
今晚这张桌子上
There have been a lot of

1732
02:00:08,550 --> 02:00:10,790
有太多谎言
lies said around this diner table here tonight,

1733
02:00:10,820 --> 02:00:12,440
但这句话绝不是说了玩的
but that you can believe!

1734
02:00:13,640 --> 02:00:14,750
莫盖尔先生
Mr. Moguy,

1735
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:16,080
能不能请你帮个忙
would you be so kind as to

1736
02:00:16,090 --> 02:00:18,610
把这两个家伙腰上挂的手枪收过来
collect the pistol hangin' on those boys hips here?

1737
02:00:23,450 --> 02:00:24,830
非常感谢
Thank you ever so much.

1738
02:00:24,900 --> 02:00:26,020
医生
Doctor.

1739
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:31,680
我们说到哪了
Where were we?

1740
02:00:36,180 --> 02:00:37,450
可恶
Jackass.

1741
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:42,800
想起来了
Oh yes...

1742
02:00:43,310 --> 02:00:45,260
我觉得你已经准备好
I do believe you were just getting

1743
02:00:45,260 --> 02:00:48,070
说服我答应把布鲁姆希尔达卖给你了
ready to make me a proposition to buy Broomhilda.

1744
02:00:48,750 --> 02:00:50,020
没说错吧
I am right?

1745
02:00:54,230 --> 02:00:55,120
没错
Right.

1746
02:00:57,820 --> 02:00:59,320
把希尔迪带过来
Bring out Hildi!

1747
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:03,620
去吧  亲爱的
Your way, honey.

1748
02:01:05,210 --> 02:01:07,410
给我他妈的坐在椅子上
Sit your ass in that goddamn chair!

1749
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:08,880
把手放到桌子上
Lay your hands flat on that table.

1750
02:01:08,940 --> 02:01:10,760
然后给我闭嘴
And shut your mouth!

1751
02:01:14,590 --> 02:01:16,150
舒尔茨医生
Dr. Schultz...

1752
02:01:16,150 --> 02:01:18,980
在格林维尔的时候  您自己说
in Greenville, you yourself said,

1753
02:01:19,090 --> 02:01:21,250
为了买到理想的黑人
that for the "Right Nigger" you'd be willing to pay

1754
02:01:21,260 --> 02:01:24,400
就算别人觉得是天价你也愿意付
what some may consider is a ridiculous amount.

1755
02:01:25,070 --> 02:01:26,200
然后我问
To which, me myself said,

1756
02:01:26,200 --> 02:01:28,050
怎么才算天价呢
"What is your definition of ridiculous?",

1757
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:31,920
您回答说  一万二
to which you said, "Twelve thousand dollars".

1758
02:01:32,980 --> 02:01:36,790
考虑到你们骑了这么远的路过来
Now considering you all have ridden a whole lotta miles,

1759
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:38,640
费尽周折
went to a whole lotta trouble,

1760
02:01:38,940 --> 02:01:41,060
花了这么大的代价
and done spread a whole lotta bull,

1761
02:01:41,060 --> 02:01:43,480
来买这位可爱的小姐
to purchase this lovely lady right here,

1762
02:01:43,510 --> 02:01:47,320
看来布鲁姆希尔达正是
it would appear that Broomhilda is

1763
02:01:47,320 --> 02:01:48,810
你的理想黑人
in fact the "Right Nigger"!

1764
02:01:50,060 --> 02:01:51,570
如果你们想带着布鲁姆希尔达
And if y'all wanna leave Candyland

1765
02:01:51,580 --> 02:01:52,740
一起离开坎迪庄园
with Broomhilda...

1766
02:01:53,820 --> 02:01:56,130
那我就开价
the price is

1767
02:01:56,130 --> 02:01:59,140
一万二
twelve thousand dollars.

1768
02:01:59,530 --> 02:02:01,170
我猜您在谈生意的时候
And I take it you prefer the

1769
02:02:01,170 --> 02:02:03,690
不太喜欢还价
"take it or leave it" style of negotiating?

1770
02:02:05,610 --> 02:02:07,430
没错  医生
Yes I do, doctor.

1771
02:02:07,970 --> 02:02:11,570
按照奇卡索人县的法律
You see, under the laws of Chickasaw County,

1772
02:02:11,570 --> 02:02:14,100
布鲁姆希尔达是我本人的财产
Broomhilda here is my property.

1773
02:02:14,650 --> 02:02:18,030
而我想对我的财产做什么
And I can chose to do with my property

1774
02:02:18,030 --> 02:02:19,860
都可以
whatever I so desire!

1775
02:02:21,060 --> 02:02:23,720
如果你们都觉得我给这个黑鬼
And if you all think my price

1776
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:27,600
开的价太高
for this nigger here is too steep,

1777
02:02:27,820 --> 02:02:30,420
那我要做的就是
what I'm gonna desire to do is

1778
02:02:34,550 --> 02:02:35,870
抄起这把锤子
take this fuckin' hammer here,

1779
02:02:35,870 --> 02:02:37,570
把她锤死
and beat her ass to death with it!

1780
02:02:37,650 --> 02:02:39,180
就在你们两个面前锤死
Right in front of both y'all!

1781
02:02:39,200 --> 02:02:40,060
这主意不错吧  伙计
Ain't it good, fella?

1782
02:02:40,060 --> 02:02:44,450
然后我们就能看布鲁姆希尔达头骨里的3个凹槽在哪
Then we can examine the three dimples inside Broomhilda skull!

1783
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:45,910
现在
Now!

1784
02:02:46,040 --> 02:02:48,330
你打算怎么办  医生
What's it gonna be, Doc? Huh?

1785
02:02:49,270 --> 02:02:50,160
你打算怎么办
What's it gonna be?

1786
02:02:50,180 --> 02:02:51,680
我可以抬起手
May I lift the hands off the table top

1787
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:53,780
去拿我的皮夹吗
in order to remove my billfold?

1788
02:02:55,590 --> 02:02:56,710
当然可以
Yes you may.

1789
02:03:10,570 --> 02:03:11,690
这里是一万二
That twelve.

1790
02:03:15,820 --> 02:03:17,240
成交
Sold!

1791
02:03:17,950 --> 02:03:21,160
卖给大胡子
To the man with the exceptional beard,

1792
02:03:21,160 --> 02:03:23,610
和黑鬼小子
and his unexceptional nigger.

1793
02:03:29,700 --> 02:03:31,720
-莫盖尔先生  -什么事  卡尔文
- Mr. Moguy. - Yes Calvin?

1794
02:03:32,730 --> 02:03:34,110
请你给这位先生
You make this gentleman a receipt

1795
02:03:34,110 --> 02:03:36,070
开张1万2千美元的收据
for twelve thousand dollar, please.

1796
02:03:36,230 --> 02:03:39,050
-1万2千美元  -没错
- Twelve thousand dollar. - Hm.

1797
02:03:41,070 --> 02:03:43,470
合作愉快
It was a pleasure doin' business with ya all.

1798
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:45,480
现在  先生们
Now gentlemen

1799
02:03:46,830 --> 02:03:48,920
欢迎你们来客厅
If you care to join me in the parlor

1800
02:03:49,770 --> 02:03:52,070
享用我们的奶油蛋糕
we will be serving white cake.

1801
02:05:20,440 --> 02:05:21,990
干得好  卡尔文
Well done, Calvin.

1802
02:05:24,810 --> 02:05:27,630
不好意思  我说不好意思  女士
Excuse me. Excuse me, madam?

1803
02:05:28,820 --> 02:05:31,220
请不要弹贝多芬了好吗
Could you please stop playing Beethoven?

1804
02:05:31,260 --> 02:05:32,600
把你的手从竖琴拿开
Take your hands off that harp!

1805
02:05:36,990 --> 02:05:38,110
医生
Doctor!

1806
02:05:38,380 --> 02:05:40,980
-医生  你不能进去  -没事  史蒂芬
- Doc, you can't go in there! - Hey uh, Steven, hey!

1807
02:05:40,990 --> 02:05:43,010
-他无权进那个房间  -让他去吧
- He got no business goin' in there. - Let it be.

1808
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:47,180
他就是有点沮丧  我来搞定
He's a little upset, that's all. I'll handle this.

1809
02:06:12,940 --> 02:06:14,060
要奶油蛋糕吗
White cake?

1810
02:06:15,200 --> 02:06:18,000
我不爱吃甜食  谢谢
I don't go in for sweets, thank you.

1811
02:06:27,530 --> 02:06:29,990
你还在纠结被我玩弄于鼓掌的事情吗
You brooding 'bout me getting the best of ya, uh?

1812
02:06:30,910 --> 02:06:33,420
实际上  我在想那个
Actually, I was thinking of that poor devil

1813
02:06:33,420 --> 02:06:35,430
被你喂狗的可怜鬼
you fed to the dogs today.

1814
02:06:35,670 --> 02:06:37,020
达达尼昂
D'Artagnan.

1815
02:06:35,670 --> 02:06:37,020
该名也是大仲马《三个火枪手》主角的名字

1816
02:06:38,460 --> 02:06:41,420
我也在想大仲马对此会有什么想法
And I was wondering what Dumas would make of all this.

1817
02:06:42,250 --> 02:06:44,050
你说什么
Come again?

1818
02:06:46,930 --> 02:06:50,780
亚历山大・仲马  他写了《三个火枪手》
Alexandre Dumas. He wrote "The Three Musketeers".

1819
02:06:51,200 --> 02:06:52,910
没错  医生
Yes of course, doctor.

1820
02:06:52,950 --> 02:06:54,700
我觉得你肯定是大仲马的崇拜者
I figured you must be an admirer,

1821
02:06:54,710 --> 02:06:58,480
你连黑奴都用他小说的主角名命名
you named your slave after his novel's lead character.

1822
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:03,050
我在想如果大仲马还健在
Now if Alexandre Dumas had been there today,

1823
02:07:03,110 --> 02:07:05,350
他对此又会有什么想法呢
I wonder what he would have made of it?

1824
02:07:07,340 --> 02:07:08,990
你不认为他会赞同吗
You doubt he'd approve?

1825
02:07:11,150 --> 02:07:15,580
不  我对此严重怀疑
Yes, his approval would be a dubious proposition at best.

1826
02:07:18,570 --> 02:07:20,340
你认为他是个心软的法国人是吗
Soft hearted Frenchy?

1827
02:07:22,370 --> 02:07:24,370
大仲马他自己就是黑人
Alexandre Dumas is black.

1828
02:07:28,460 --> 02:07:30,300
这些是布鲁姆希尔达的卖契吗
Are these Broomhilda's papers?

1829
02:07:30,410 --> 02:07:32,230
-是的  -我能看一下吗
- Yes they are. - May I?

1830
02:07:32,360 --> 02:07:34,150
-当然了  -谢谢
- Of course! - Thank you.

1831
02:07:36,860 --> 02:07:38,590
这张收据
I dealt- her bill of sale of ownership

1832
02:07:38,600 --> 02:07:42,070
也有还她自由的法律效力  医生
is written of course a freedom papers, doctor.

1833
02:07:42,290 --> 02:07:44,450
能借用下墨水和笔吗
Would you have ink and pen for me?

1834
02:07:45,650 --> 02:07:47,520
就在那个小桌子上
Right over there, on that little table.

1835
02:07:47,610 --> 02:07:49,010
谢谢
Thank you.

1836
02:08:09,880 --> 02:08:11,280
谢谢
Thank you.

1837
02:08:14,770 --> 02:08:16,590
布鲁姆希尔达・冯・夏福特
Broomhilda Von Shaft

1838
02:08:19,080 --> 02:08:21,300
你从此自由了
consider yourself a free woman.

1839
02:08:33,500 --> 02:08:35,320
坎迪先生
Mister Candy

1840
02:08:37,240 --> 02:08:40,750
通常  我会说用德语说再见
Normally, I would say "auf wiedersehen".

1841
02:08:41,480 --> 02:08:43,310
不过  鉴于德语的再见这个词
But since what "Auf Wiedersehen"

1842
02:08:43,310 --> 02:08:45,670
实际上意为  期待与你再会
actually means is "till I see you again",

1843
02:08:46,370 --> 02:08:49,700
也鉴于我不希望再见到你  对你的话
and since I never wish to see you again, to you sir,

1844
02:08:50,130 --> 02:08:52,730
我就说拜拜了
I say good bye.

1845
02:08:56,980 --> 02:08:58,380
我们走
Let's go.

1846
02:08:59,720 --> 02:09:00,840
走吧
Com'on.

1847
02:09:02,850 --> 02:09:05,250
请留步  医生
One more moment, Doctor!

1848
02:09:06,650 --> 02:09:07,720
怎么了
What?

1849
02:09:12,290 --> 02:09:14,470
在我们南方有个习俗
It's a custom here in the South,

1850
02:09:14,990 --> 02:09:18,160
一桩买卖完成时  交易双方要
once a business deal is concluded that the two parties

1851
02:09:18,830 --> 02:09:20,540
握手
shake hands.

1852
02:09:21,270 --> 02:09:22,660
以表诚意
It implies good faith.

1853
02:09:23,470 --> 02:09:25,590
-我不是南方人  -但你就站在
- I'm not from the South. - But you are

1854
02:09:26,590 --> 02:09:28,120
我的房子里
in my house doctor.

1855
02:09:29,710 --> 02:09:31,310
所以我坚持握下手
So I'm afraid I must insist.

1856
02:09:31,580 --> 02:09:35,080
坚持  坚持什么  握手吗
Insist? On what? That I shake your hand?

1857
02:09:35,100 --> 02:09:38,230
那我不得不坚持不握手了
Oh, then I'm afraid I must insist in the opposite direction.

1858
02:09:38,940 --> 02:09:40,450
你知道你在我眼里是什么吗
You know what I think you are?

1859
02:09:40,640 --> 02:09:43,640
我在你眼里是什么  我不知道
What you think I am? No I don't.

1860
02:09:45,490 --> 02:09:47,650
在我眼里你是个输不起的人
I think you are a bad loser.

1861
02:09:47,830 --> 02:09:50,830
我认为你是个胜之不武的人
And I think you're an abysmal winner.

1862
02:09:51,020 --> 02:09:52,530
不管怎样
Never the less

1863
02:09:52,880 --> 02:09:55,780
在奇卡索人郡  如果双方不握手
here in Chickasaw County, a deal ain't done

1864
02:09:56,110 --> 02:09:58,730
一桩买卖就不算完成
until the two parties have shook hands.

1865
02:09:59,370 --> 02:10:02,410
那些签字文件狗屁都不算
Even after all that paper signin', don't mean shit

1866
02:10:03,340 --> 02:10:06,380
除非你和我握手
you don't shake my hand.

1867
02:10:07,720 --> 02:10:10,660
如果我不和你握手
If I don't shake your hand,

1868
02:10:10,850 --> 02:10:13,500
你就不要那一万二了吗
you're gonna throw away twelve thousand dollars?

1869
02:10:13,680 --> 02:10:15,780
我才不信
I don't think so.

1870
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:18,280
布奇先生
Mr. Butch,

1871
02:10:19,650 --> 02:10:22,390
如果这个黑奴控德国佬不握手
if she tries to leave here before this nigger lovin' German

1872
02:10:22,390 --> 02:10:23,660
那女人就想走的话
shakes my hand,

1873
02:10:24,430 --> 02:10:26,590
你就毙了她
you cut her ass down.

1874
02:10:48,170 --> 02:10:51,420
你非要我和你握手吗
You really want me to shake your hand?

1875
02:10:52,950 --> 02:10:54,510
我坚持
I insist.

1876
02:10:55,970 --> 02:10:58,220
如果你一定要这么坚持的话
If you insist.

1877
02:11:16,450 --> 02:11:18,210
卡尔文
Aaah Calvin!

1878
02:11:19,100 --> 02:11:21,200
卡尔文
Caalvin!

1879
02:11:26,970 --> 02:11:29,430
抱歉  实在忍不住了
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

1880
02:11:42,140 --> 02:11:44,070
这黑鬼疯了  该死
The nigger's going crazy, the hell

1881
02:11:44,720 --> 02:11:47,390
救命啊  他见谁咬谁
Help, he's blowing everybody- Aaah!

1882
02:12:04,450 --> 02:12:06,570
靠  那狗娘养的
Shit! Son of a bitch!

1883
02:12:10,720 --> 02:12:11,840
宰了他
Get that fuckin'

1884
02:12:12,470 --> 02:12:13,590
赶紧宰了他
Get that fuckin'

1885
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:21,180
王八蛋  我靠  该死
Damn son of a bitch, what- what did the fuckin'- god damn it!

1886
02:12:22,840 --> 02:12:23,960
该死
What the

1887
02:12:25,670 --> 02:12:27,030
别打我
Don't strike me!

1888
02:12:27,130 --> 02:12:28,850
你这个蠢货
You stupid son of a bitch!

1889
02:12:28,920 --> 02:12:30,320
对不起  杰西
Sorry Jessie!

1890
02:12:30,400 --> 02:12:34,990
谁他妈把枪给这黑鬼了
Who the fuck gave a nigger a goddamn gun!

1891
02:13:08,190 --> 02:13:10,510
黑鬼  来受死吧
Nigger, com'on and kill

1892
02:13:10,920 --> 02:13:14,160
老天  我的上帝啊  
Aah! God! Ah my God, aah!

1893
02:13:14,280 --> 02:13:16,130
狗娘养的
Motherfucker!

1894
02:14:22,270 --> 02:14:24,070
靠
Shit.

1895
02:14:35,630 --> 02:14:37,450
别开枪
Hold your fire!

1896
02:14:40,290 --> 02:14:42,110
别开枪
Hold your fire!

1897
02:14:43,590 --> 02:14:45,690
挺火  可恶
Stop shooting, god damn it!

1898
02:14:54,280 --> 02:14:55,400
姜戈
Django!

1899
02:14:56,280 --> 02:14:57,400
怎么了
What?

1900
02:15:00,260 --> 02:15:02,080
你的女人在我们手里
We got your woman!

1901
02:15:03,270 --> 02:15:06,340
比利・克拉什用枪对着她脑袋呢
Billy Crash here ha' got his pistol upside her hair!

1902
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:08,880
你乖乖停火投降
You'll stop all that gettin'on,

1903
02:15:08,980 --> 02:15:11,510
她的脑袋就不会开花
he don't blow her goddamn brains out.

1904
02:15:11,690 --> 02:15:13,580
也不会开天窗
And that ain't no third holes, boy!

1905
02:15:14,530 --> 02:15:15,900
这一点我们能保证
That there is a promise.

1906
02:15:18,970 --> 02:15:20,090
如果你不投降
You ain't give up?

1907
02:15:20,540 --> 02:15:22,640
还一意孤行要打
Thought you going, uh?

1908
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:24,080
我们就杀了你
We will kill you!

1909
02:15:24,450 --> 02:15:25,850
我怎么信你
How shit?!

1910
02:15:26,050 --> 02:15:28,770
实话  姜戈  我向上帝发誓
Honest, ain't lyin', Django, I swear o' all God.

1911
02:15:30,170 --> 02:15:31,290
你投降吗
You give up?

1912
02:15:32,150 --> 02:15:34,420
没人会伤害你的
Ain't no harm gonna come t'you.

1913
02:15:36,300 --> 02:15:38,350
我怎么相信你这个死黑鬼
And I'm supposed to believe your black ass?

1914
02:15:38,720 --> 02:15:40,600
我他妈才不管
Personal, I ain't give a good goddamn

1915
02:15:40,600 --> 02:15:41,850
你是信还是不信
what you believe or don't believe!

1916
02:15:41,890 --> 02:15:44,960
我只知道  如果10秒内你还不投降
I believe, if you don't give up in the next ten seconds,

1917
02:15:44,970 --> 02:15:47,140
我们就把婊子爆头
we gonna blow this bitch her brains out!

1918
02:15:47,150 --> 02:15:48,960
你看你信不信
Believe that!

1919
02:15:53,180 --> 02:15:54,580
别管我了

1928
02:16:07,270 --> 02:16:08,600
我投降

1929
02:16:09,420 --> 02:16:11,560
我听不到  黑鬼
I can't hear you, nigger.

1930
02:16:12,460 --> 02:16:14,540
我说  我投降
I said I give up!

1931
02:18:14,960 --> 02:18:16,790
别来无恙  黑鬼
Hock a litl'e doodle, nigger.

1932
02:18:22,490 --> 02:18:24,770
你们都是赏金猎人吧
So y'all bounty hunters, huh?

1933
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:27,840
我就知道你们都有鬼
I knew there was something fishy 'bout y'all.

1934
02:18:29,350 --> 02:18:30,800
鞍袋里有悬赏海报
We found your "wanted" posters

1935
02:18:30,800 --> 02:18:34,020
还有一本头像图册
and book of figures in your saddle bags.

1936
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:37,300
老实说
I gotta say

1937
02:18:38,110 --> 02:18:40,700
我从没听过有黑鬼赏金猎人
I ain't never heard of no black bounty hunter before.

1938
02:18:41,430 --> 02:18:43,130
杀白人换钱的黑鬼
A black boy paid to kill white men,

1939
02:18:43,130 --> 02:18:44,740
你喜欢干那一行吗

1940
02:18:45,570 --> 02:18:48,370
也许还挺喜欢的  是吧
Prob'bly pretty good while it lasted, uh?

1941
02:18:57,980 --> 02:19:00,090
和你的蛋蛋告别吧  黑鬼
Time to say good night to them nuts, black.

1942
02:19:00,280 --> 02:19:01,360

1943
02:19:02,140 --> 02:19:03,240

冷静点  黑鬼  别激动
Calm down nigger, keep calm.

1947
02:19:10,030 --> 02:19:11,150
队长
Cap't?

1948
02:19:11,640 --> 02:19:13,160
劳拉小姐想见你
Miss Lara wants to see you.

1949
02:19:14,260 --> 02:19:17,070
老爷的葬礼有点事麻烦你
That is somethin' to do with the Old Man's funeral.

1950
02:19:18,450 --> 02:19:21,920
她也不想阉了姜戈了
Oh, and she changed her mind 'bout snippin' Django.

1951
02:19:23,070 --> 02:19:26,380
她要把他交给乐昆・迪奇的人
She gonna give 'em to the LeQuint Dickey people.

1952
02:19:27,670 --> 02:19:30,230
她都不愿意花一秒钟告诉我
Well she didn't waste a minute tellin' me.

1953
02:19:37,010 --> 02:19:39,190
多扫兴啊
How disappointing.

1954
02:20:01,810 --> 02:20:02,930
你人要走

这些
These ain't

02:20:06,450 --> 02:20:08,270
你可别想带走
what you take with you.

1957
02:20:11,330 --> 02:20:14,850
过去几个小时里
Your black ass been all the motherfuckers' in that Big House

1958
02:20:14,900 --> 02:20:17,530
所有人都在谈论你这黑鬼
could talk about for the last few hours.

1959
02:20:18,440 --> 02:20:20,390
白人那脑袋瓜里
Seemed like white folk

1960
02:20:20,390 --> 02:20:22,340
从来都是馊点子
ain't never had a bright idea in their life,

1961
02:20:22,360 --> 02:20:24,800
全是怎么把你大卸八块的主意
was comin' up with all kinds o'ways to kill your ass.

1962
02:20:25,010 --> 02:20:26,900
告诉你  大多点子都是
Now mind ya, most of 'dem ideas

1963
02:20:26,900 --> 02:20:30,620
围绕怎么收拾你的老二的
had to do with fuckin' with your fun parts.

1964
02:20:30,690 --> 02:20:34,990
听起来挺不错  可是
Now, that may seem like a good idea, but truth is

1965
02:20:37,660 --> 02:20:42,330
当你割了黑鬼的蛋以后  他们大多失血而死
when you snip a nigger's nuts, most of 'em bleed out,

1966
02:20:43,610 --> 02:20:45,610
大概  也就能撑7分钟吧  大多数是这样
know 'bout...seven minutes, most of 'em

1967
02:20:47,990 --> 02:20:49,410
绝大多数人是
More than most.

1968
02:20:50,140 --> 02:20:51,730
然后我说
Then I say is

1969
02:20:53,500 --> 02:20:55,340
看起来
See if

1970
02:20:56,180 --> 02:21:00,170
卖给乐昆・迪奇的黑鬼  死的更惨
the niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey, got it worse then that.

1971
02:21:01,240 --> 02:21:04,060
我们的人只会说  抽死那黑鬼
And they're still sayin' "Let's whip 'em to death",

1972
02:21:04,140 --> 02:21:05,500
让黑鬼去打曼丁果
"Dump 'em to the mandingos”

1973
02:21:05,500 --> 02:21:07,590
把黑鬼喂给斯通菲尔的狗
"Feed 'em to Stonesipher's dogs"

1974
02:21:07,830 --> 02:21:10,790
我说  那有什么稀奇的吗
And I say, "What's so special 'bout that?"

1975
02:21:10,790 --> 02:21:12,890
我们都玩腻了
We do that shit all the time!

1976
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:15,320
我们卖给乐昆・迪奇的黑鬼
Hells bells, the niggers we sell

1977
02:21:15,320 --> 02:21:19,290
死的可比这惨多了
to LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that.

1978
02:21:20,410 --> 02:21:23,430
你看  猛然间
Lo and behold, out of nowhere,

1979
02:21:23,430 --> 02:21:27,130
劳拉小姐就想出了个好主意
Miss Lara come up with the bright idea

1980
02:21:28,070 --> 02:21:32,730
把你卖给乐昆・迪奇采矿公司
of givin' your ass to the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.

1981
02:21:34,170 --> 02:21:38,510
到那里去干矿工
And as a slave of the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company,

1982
02:21:39,250 --> 02:21:42,780
干到累死为止
henceforth, till the day you die,

1983
02:21:43,010 --> 02:21:45,980
每一天  每一夜
all day, ev'ryday,

1984
02:21:46,230 --> 02:21:48,840
你都要挥舞那大锤子
you will be swingin' a sledgehammer,

1985
02:21:49,190 --> 02:21:53,270
把大石头砸成小石头
turning big rocks into little rocks.

1986
02:21:54,440 --> 02:21:58,680
当你到那时  他们会抹去你的名字
Now when you get there, they gonna take away your name,

1987
02:21:58,840 --> 02:22:01,590
给你个号码和一把大锤子
give you a number, and a sledgehammer,

1988
02:22:02,020 --> 02:22:03,850
然后说  干活去
and say "get to work".

1989
02:22:04,660 --> 02:22:07,110
你废一句话  他们就割了你的舌头
One word of says, they cuts out your tongue,

1990
02:22:07,180 --> 02:22:09,510
他们的割技熟练到你不敢相信
they's good at that too, you won't believe that.

1991
02:22:09,770 --> 02:22:12,040
没错  他们就那么对你
Ooh, they does that for you.

1992
02:22:13,500 --> 02:22:18,440
他们会每天奴役你  直到你累垮
They gonna work you, all day, ev'ry day, till your back give up.

1993
02:22:20,400 --> 02:22:22,890
然后他们就用锤子砸烂你的头
Then they gonna hit you in the head with the hammer,

1994
02:22:23,030 --> 02:22:25,380
把你的尸体拖到黑鬼洞里
tow your ass down the nigger hole.

1995
02:22:25,880 --> 02:22:30,370
这就是你的下场  姜戈
And that... will be the story end for you, Django.

1996
02:22:34,540 --> 02:22:37,610
通往乐昆・迪奇采矿公司的路上

1997
02:23:19,890 --> 02:23:21,710
喂  白人小哥
Hey, white boy

1998
02:23:22,980 --> 02:23:24,800
我说  白人小哥
I said hey, white boy!

1999
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:27,900
闭嘴  黑鬼  我没兴趣听你扯淡
Shut up, black, you ain't got nothing to say I wanna hear.

2000
02:23:27,930 --> 02:23:30,640
你想不想赚1万1千美金
How'd you like to make eleven thousand dollars?

2001
02:23:30,690 --> 02:23:31,980

2005
02:23:40,300 --> 02:23:42,520
就在坎迪庄园种植园里

You be damned, blackie, we're not bandits.

2009
02:23:50,560 --> 02:23:53,440

I ain't sayin' that, nice thing 'bout this fortune it is.

2010

但事情不应该是这样

02:25:11,630 --> 02:25:13,160
我是个赏金猎人
I'm a bounty hunter.

2044
02:25:14,830 --> 02:25:19,290
昨天  我还是自由人  骑马进了坎迪庄园
Yesterday, as a free man, I rode in the Candyland,

2045
02:25:19,320 --> 02:25:23,540
和德国白人搭档金・舒尔茨医生一起
on a horse, with my German white partner, Dr. King Schultz.

2046
02:25:24,220 --> 02:25:25,910
我们一路追踪巴考尔团伙
We tracked the Bacall gang

2047
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:28,720
从德克萨斯一直跟到奇卡索郡
all the way from Texas, to Chikasaw County.

2048
02:25:29,080 --> 02:25:31,740
我们最终发现他们躲在坎迪庄园
We finally found their ass laying low at Candyland.

2049
02:25:32,100 --> 02:25:35,270
我们进去逮他们  可事情办砸了
We went in there to get 'em, things went sour,

2050
02:25:35,670 --> 02:25:38,730
我搭档被杀了  卡尔文・坎迪也被毙了
my partner got killed, Calvin Candie got shot.

2051
02:25:39,200 --> 02:25:43,150
他们觉得我是罪魁祸首  就把我弄这来了
Then ev'rybody there decided to blame me, so here I am.

2052
02:25:45,440 --> 02:25:47,390
但我姜戈不该在押送名单上
But Django ain't on that manifest,

2053
02:25:47,530 --> 02:25:50,200
你们也都知道我不应该在这里
and all o'you know I ain't supposed to be on this trip.

2054
02:25:50,610 --> 02:25:53,560
那4个人被通缉着还逍遥法外
But them four men are still back there, they're still wanted,

2055
02:25:54,060 --> 02:25:56,230
1万1千5百的赏金也没人领
and that eleven thousand five hundred is up for grabs,

2056
02:25:56,240 --> 02:25:57,330
他们最怕见到的
and the last thing they'd expect

2057
02:25:57,330 --> 02:25:59,200
就是你们杀回去
is y'all ridin' back and gittin' it.

2058
02:25:59,710 --> 02:26:01,530
你想怎么样
What's the deal?

2059
02:26:02,050 --> 02:26:05,970
告诉我们他们是谁  让我们给你松绑吗
You tell us who they are and we… turn you lose?

2060
02:26:06,270 --> 02:26:08,370
我不会告诉你们他们是谁
I ain't tellin' who they are.

2061
02:26:08,500 --> 02:26:11,730
但只要你们给我一把枪和一匹马
Look, you give me a pistol, one o'them horses,

2062
02:26:11,990 --> 02:26:14,950
然后从赏金中分给我五百美金
and five hundred dollars of that eleven thousand five hundred,

2063
02:26:15,240 --> 02:26:16,650
我就告诉你们他们长什么样
and I'll point 'em out to you.

2064
02:26:16,830 --> 02:26:18,170
这悬赏单倒是真的
This a real handbill.

2065
02:26:18,560 --> 02:26:19,660
但一张悬赏单并不能证明
Ah jus'cause it's a real handbill's

2066
02:26:19,660 --> 02:26:22,120
他所有的话都是真的
doesn't mean that other bunch o'malarky is.

2067
02:26:22,220 --> 02:26:24,390
但一个奴隶的口袋里
Now why would a slave have

2068
02:26:24,390 --> 02:26:28,230
又怎么会有悬赏单呢
a wanted dead or alive handbill in his pocket?

2069
02:26:32,840 --> 02:26:36,040
那黑鬼昨天确实去坎迪庄园了吗
Ain't that black ridin' into Candyland yesterday?

2070
02:26:42,010 --> 02:26:43,090
好吧
Alright

2071
02:26:43,850 --> 02:26:45,870
我再问一遍
I'm gonna ask you again

2072
02:26:47,310 --> 02:26:49,610
记住  我讨厌撒谎的人
I want you to remember I don't like liars.

2073
02:26:50,530 --> 02:26:52,670
他到底是坎迪庄园的黑奴
Is he a Candyland slave,

2074
02:26:52,670 --> 02:26:55,930
还是昨天和白人骑马进去的
or did he ride in with a white man on horse yesterday?

2075
02:26:56,410 --> 02:26:57,530
是的
Yeah.

2076
02:26:58,530 --> 02:27:00,650
他们把我们从格林维尔拍卖会带来
They walked us from the Greenville Auction and

2077
02:27:00,650 --> 02:27:02,730
他的确是和白人骑马来的
he rode in on a horse with a white man.

2078
02:27:03,650 --> 02:27:05,830
这个白人
And this white man

2079
02:27:06,030 --> 02:27:07,660
那黑人是他的黑奴吗
was the black his slave?

2080
02:27:08,080 --> 02:27:09,630
他不是黑奴
He weren't no slave.

2081
02:27:09,780 --> 02:27:11,670
你他妈的确定吗
You- you fuckin' sure about that?

2082
02:27:11,820 --> 02:27:13,220
很确定
Damn sure.

2083
02:27:17,500 --> 02:27:19,290
坎迪庄园里发生了什么
What happened over at Candyland?

2084
02:27:19,350 --> 02:27:20,400
枪林弹雨的
Bunch of shootin'

2085
02:27:21,030 --> 02:27:22,330
主人被杀了
master got shot.

2086
02:27:23,010 --> 02:27:24,670
-谁杀的  -那德国人
- Who shot 'em? - The German.

2087
02:27:25,160 --> 02:27:26,370
为什么
Why did he do that?

2088
02:27:26,910 --> 02:27:28,220
黑鬼和德国人装成
The nigger and the German was

2089
02:27:28,220 --> 02:27:30,400
奴隶贩子的样子  可他们不是
actin' like they were slavers, but they weren't.

2090
02:27:30,720 --> 02:27:32,400
那他们到底是什么人
Well, what were they?

2091
02:27:32,580 --> 02:27:34,280
赏金猎人
Bounty hunters.

2092
02:27:35,090 --> 02:27:37,750
我靠  罗伊  这可是大买卖  伙计
Fuck me Roy, I mean this- this could be big, mate!

2093
02:27:39,170 --> 02:27:40,490
好吧  黑鬼
Well, smoke

2094
02:27:41,280 --> 02:27:42,670
我们成交
you gotta deal.

2095
02:27:43,940 --> 02:27:45,370
我还有个条件
I got one more condition.

2096
02:27:45,980 --> 02:27:46,920
什么条件
What is that?

2097
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,860
我们到那里后  要动手时
When we get there… when the time come

2098
02:27:52,180 --> 02:27:54,040
让我帮忙一起杀
you let me help you kill 'em.

2099
02:27:55,330 --> 02:27:56,970
你还挺有意思
You're a funny bugger!

2100
02:27:57,210 --> 02:27:58,990
-给他松绑  -好的
- Get him loose. - Yeah, yeah.

2101
02:27:59,460 --> 02:28:01,480
一言为定  小黑哥
You got yourself a deal, blackie.

2102
02:28:01,600 --> 02:28:03,260
一言为定  伙计
You got yourself a deal, mate.

2103
02:28:05,570 --> 02:28:07,880
-你这小黑挺够意思的  -可不是
- You alright for a black fella! - Oh yeah!

2104
02:28:09,930 --> 02:28:11,050
老天
Jeez

2105
02:28:13,770 --> 02:28:16,220
这就给你松绑了  伙计
There ya go... There ya go, mate.

2106
02:28:17,260 --> 02:28:19,660
给你那匹专驮货的马
For you, we'll give you that pack horse over here.

2107
02:28:19,920 --> 02:28:21,860
那鞍袋里有什么
What's them saddle bags got in?

2108
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:23,230
炸药
Dynamite.

2109
02:28:23,260 --> 02:28:26,140
我才不要骑背着炸药的马
I ain't ridin' no horse with no goddamn dynamite on his back.

2110
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:27,470
可以理解
I can understand that.

2111
02:28:28,280 --> 02:28:31,440
弗兰奇  把炸药搬下来
Frankie, we take 'em sticks off that horse,

2112
02:28:31,440 --> 02:28:33,860
放在装黑鬼的笼子里
and stick 'em in the nigger cage.

2113
02:28:35,110 --> 02:28:38,250
给你们这些黑鬼一点炸药玩玩
A little dynamite for you black ass to play with!

2114
02:28:48,640 --> 02:28:51,390
弗洛伊德  你在车上还有杆来福枪吧
Hey Floyd, you got that rifle on the wagon, don't you?

2115
02:28:51,420 --> 02:28:52,330
没错
Yeah, alright.

2116
02:28:52,470 --> 02:28:54,510
把你的枪和枪带都给他吧
Don't you give him your gun and gun belt.

2117
02:28:56,780 --> 02:28:59,320
别给我弄丢了  听到没
Now, don't drop the fucking thing, alright?

2118
02:28:59,870 --> 02:29:02,670
我才刚修过准心  好用着呢
I just had the sights fixed, and that perfect.

2119
02:29:02,960 --> 02:29:04,550
多谢相告
Uh, that's good to know.

2120
02:30:36,670 --> 02:30:38,640
把炸药扔给我
Throw me up that dynamite.

2121
02:32:08,840 --> 02:32:10,530
-杰克  -怎么了
- Jake! - Yeah?

2122
02:32:10,550 --> 02:32:14,120
你去看看那该死的狗怎么回事
You gotta try to see what's goin'on with that goddamn dog!

2123
02:32:18,580 --> 02:32:20,430
下地狱吧  畜生们
Go to hell, you motherfucker!

2124
02:33:50,260 --> 02:33:51,910
我也爱你  孩子
Love you too, son.

2125
02:34:52,130 --> 02:34:53,530
是我  宝贝儿
It's me, baby.

2126
02:35:41,840 --> 02:35:44,740
甜蜜的
In the sweet

2127
02:35:45,250 --> 02:35:49,170
别离
Byin' bye

2128
02:35:50,460 --> 02:35:52,540
我们将别离
We will leave

2129
02:35:53,330 --> 02:35:58,030
在那歌谣里
On that beautiful song.

2130
02:36:03,890 --> 02:36:08,130
别离  别离
Byin' bye... bye bye

2131
02:36:08,150 --> 02:36:12,610
我们将别离  我们将要别离
We will leave… we will leave byin' bye.

2132
02:36:12,620 --> 02:36:13,470
科拉
Cora,

2133
02:36:13,550 --> 02:36:15,750
能冲些咖啡吗
would you prepare us some coffee?

2134
02:36:15,920 --> 02:36:17,710
希巴  你去帮忙
Sheba, you help her.

2135
02:36:17,780 --> 02:36:18,880
走吧
Come on.

2136
02:36:21,270 --> 02:36:24,070
在那歌谣里
In the sweet

2137
02:36:24,400 --> 02:36:28,430
别离
Byin' bye, ooh

2138
02:36:29,600 --> 02:36:32,890
你们马上要去地下和卡尔文相会了
Ya'all gonna be together with Calvin and the byin bye.

2139
02:36:39,590 --> 02:36:41,940
比你们预期的还要快那么一点
Just a bit sooner than ya'all was expectin'.

2140
02:36:50,280 --> 02:36:51,650
比利・克拉什
Billy Crash!

2141
02:36:51,970 --> 02:36:53,720
为什么
Now why would?

2142
02:36:53,940 --> 02:36:55,480
对  没错
Oh, that's right.

2143
02:36:56,520 --> 02:37:00,900
上次  你把你的手放在我的...
Last time I seen you, you had your hands on my...

2144
02:37:13,410 --> 02:37:14,850
姜戈
Django!

2145
02:37:15,020 --> 02:37:17,080
你这杀千刀的黑鬼
You black, son of a bitch!

2146
02:37:17,110 --> 02:37:18,310
这是给你的  比利
To dear son, hey Billy.

2147
02:37:19,750 --> 02:37:20,870
天啊
Oh no!

2148
02:37:22,770 --> 02:37:24,960
现在  我的黑人同胞们
Now, all o'you black folks,

2149
02:37:24,960 --> 02:37:29,030
我建议你们离这些白人远一些
I suggest you get away from all these white folks.

2150
02:37:30,230 --> 02:37:31,740
除了你  史蒂芬
Not you Steven.

2151
02:37:32,590 --> 02:37:34,860
你给我待着别动
You're right where you belong.

2152
02:37:36,790 --> 02:37:38,360
科拉  你走之前
Uh, Cora, before you go

2153
02:37:38,830 --> 02:37:40,930
可以和劳拉小姐道别吗
would you tell miss Lara goodbye?

2154
02:37:41,640 --> 02:37:42,740
什么
Do- do what now?

2155
02:37:43,030 --> 02:37:46,170
我说  和劳拉小姐  道个别
I said tell... miss Lara... goodbye.

2156
02:37:48,010 --> 02:37:48,890
再见  劳拉小姐
Bye miss Lara.

2157
02:37:54,010 --> 02:37:55,630
你们两个走吧
Ya'all two run along now.

2158
02:38:13,890 --> 02:38:15,010
史蒂夫
Steve!

2159
02:38:15,480 --> 02:38:17,670
喜欢我的新衣服吗
How you like my… new dirt?

2160
02:38:19,020 --> 02:38:21,620
一小时前  我还不知道酒红色很配我呢
You know for an hour, I didn't know the burgundy was my color.

2161
02:38:33,250 --> 02:38:35,070
我听到你开了六枪了  黑鬼
I count six shots, nigger.

2162
02:38:36,810 --> 02:38:38,910
我带了两把枪  黑鬼
I count two guns, nigger.

2163
02:38:42,310 --> 02:38:44,500
你说你在这种植园待了76年
You said in 76 years on this plantation,

2164
02:38:44,500 --> 02:38:46,680
什么场面都见过  是吧
you seen all o'manner shit done, ain'it?

2165
02:38:47,390 --> 02:38:48,990
不过我发现
But I noticed

2166
02:38:49,180 --> 02:38:50,470
你没穿护膝
you didn't knit your knee cap.

2167
02:38:54,320 --> 02:38:55,840
76年了  史蒂芬
Seventy six years, Steven

2168
02:38:56,230 --> 02:38:59,300
来来往往的黑奴你见过多少了  7000吗
how many niggers you think you see come n' go, uh, 7000?

2169
02:39:00,210 --> 02:39:01,830
8000吗
8000?

2170
02:39:01,870 --> 02:39:03,170
9000吗
9000?

2171
02:39:03,800 --> 02:39:05,770
9999吗
9999?

2172
02:39:06,440 --> 02:39:07,990
卡尔文・坎迪嘴里说的每句话
Ev'ry single word that came out

2173
02:39:07,990 --> 02:39:10,500
都是冷血的狗屁言辞
of Calvin Candy's mouth was nothin' but cold shit.

2174
02:39:10,570 --> 02:39:12,260
但有件事他说对了
But he was right 'bout one thing.

2175
02:39:12,450 --> 02:39:14,550
我就是那万里挑一的黑人
I am that one nigger in ten thousand.

2176
02:39:17,230 --> 02:39:19,400
你这狗娘养的
You son of a bitch!
