00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:49,221
德克薩斯州某處

是誰在黑暗堸降陌幸帚滿H
Who's that stumblin' around in the dark?

12
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:25,806
報上名來，否則等著吃槍子兒吧！
State your business, or prepare to get winged!

13
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:30,605
先生們，冷靜點，我不是壞人
Calm yourselves gentlemen, I mean you no harm.

14
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:35,173
我也只是個疲勞的旅者
I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.

15
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,327
真冷啊，晚上好先生們，
Good cold evening gentlemen,

16
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:41,977
我正在找兩個奴隸販子
I'm looking for a pair of slave traders

17
00:04:41,985 --> 00:04:43,736
他們叫斯派克兄弟
that go by the name of the Speck Brothers.

18
00:04:43,923 --> 00:04:45,610
是不是就是你們？
Might that be you?

19
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:48,166
是誰問的？
Who wants to know?

20
00:04:48,237 --> 00:04:49,716
是我
Well, I do.

21
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:52,634
我是金·舒爾茲醫生， 這是我的馬，弗堹
I'm Dr. King Schultz, this is my horse, Fritz.

22
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:55,251
什麼醫生啊？
What kinda doctor?

23
00:04:55,685 --> 00:04:56,698
牙醫
Dentist.

24
00:04:56,957 --> 00:04:58,487
你們是不是就是斯派克兄弟，
Now are you the Speck Brothers,

25
00:04:58,496 --> 00:05:01,299
這些奴隸是不是你們 在格林威爾奴隸拍賣會上買來的？
 and did you purchase those men at the Greenville slave auction?

26
00:05:01,325 --> 00:05:02,233
是又怎樣？
So what?

27
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:04,325
我只是想跟你們@#¥¥%（這埵陪茧不是英語）
So, I wish to parley with you.

28
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:05,426
說英語！
Speak English.

29
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,430
噢對不起
Oh, I'm sorry.

30
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,031
請原諒，那是我的一門外語
Please forgive me, it is a second language.

31
00:05:10,156 --> 00:05:13,653
在你的商品清單堶情A我...
Now, amongst your inventory, I've been led to believe,

32
00:05:13,662 --> 00:05:15,706
認為有一個人我很想買
 is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.

33
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:18,180
你們好哇，可憐人
Hello you poor devils!

34
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:25,511
你們之中是不是有一個， 以前在卡拉坎農場呆過？
Is there one amongst you, who was formerly a resident of The Carrucan Plantation?

35
00:05:25,815 --> 00:05:28,815
我是從卡拉坎農場來的
I'm from The Carrucan Plantation.

36
00:05:29,557 --> 00:05:31,322
剛才是誰？
Who said that?

37
00:06:18,227 --> 00:06:19,998
你叫什麼名字？
What's your name?

38
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:25,511
姜戈
Django.

39
00:06:26,004 --> 00:06:28,704
你就是我要找的人了
Then you're exactly the one I'm looking for.

40
00:06:30,426 --> 00:06:32,720
你知道布埵咱S弟是誰嗎？
Do you know who the Brittle Brothers are?

41
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:38,184
都有誰？
Who are they?

42
00:06:39,645 --> 00:06:41,736
大約翰…
Big John…

43
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,025
埃利斯...
Ellis…

44
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:48,630
還有拉什， 他們有時候叫他小拉什的
and Raja… sometime they call him Lit'le Raj.

45
00:06:50,006 --> 00:06:52,269
他們之前是卡拉坎農場的監工
They was overseers at Carrucan plantation.

46
00:06:52,477 --> 00:06:53,597
現在不在了
Not anymore.

47
00:06:56,857 --> 00:06:57,977
告訴我…
Tell me…

48
00:06:58,425 --> 00:07:02,392
如果你能再見到這三兄弟， 你能認出來嗎？
If you were to see any of these three gentlemen again, would you recognize them?

49
00:07:02,471 --> 00:07:03,591
嘿!
Hey!

50
00:07:04,254 --> 00:07:05,590
別那樣跟他說話
Stop talk with 'em like that.

51
00:07:05,894 --> 00:07:06,935
哪樣啊？
Like what?

52
00:07:07,183 --> 00:07:08,169
剛才那樣!
Like that!

53
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:11,113
好兄弟，我只是¥%…@#
My good man, I'm simply trying to ascertain-

54
00:07:11,136 --> 00:07:12,777
該死的，說英語
Speak English, goddammit!

55
00:07:12,903 --> 00:07:15,182
大家都冷靜點嘛,
Everybody calm down,

56
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:19,204
我只是個想好好買東西的顧客而已
I'm simply a customer trying to conduct a transaction.

57
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:21,076
我不管，不賣了，
I don't care. No sale.

58
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,139
你走吧！
Now off wit' you!

59
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:25,561
別這樣，他們當然是拿來賣的啦
Oh, don't be ridiculous, o'course they're for sale.

60
00:07:25,734 --> 00:07:27,294
老實走開！
Move it.

61
00:07:27,575 --> 00:07:32,783
天哪，你這是舉著槍嚇唬我呢，
My good man, did you simply get carried away with your dramatic gesture,

62
00:07:32,783 --> 00:07:36,728
還是非得殺了我不可啊
or are you pointing your weapon at me with lethal intention?

63
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,930
最後一次機會了，滑頭
Last chance, fancy pants.

64
00:07:40,796 --> 00:07:42,825
那好吧
Oh, very well…

65
00:08:12,202 --> 00:08:14,514
不好意思連你的座駕也一起傷了，
I'm sorry to have put a bullet in your beast,

66
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:16,655
我只是不想讓你在冷靜下來之前
but I didn't want you to do anything rash

67
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,229
輕舉妄動什麼的
before you had a moment to come to your senses.

68
00:08:19,626 --> 00:08:22,319
你這該死的狗娘養的!
Goddamn son of a bitch!

69
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,616
你打傷了我的馬！
You shot Roscoe!

70
00:08:25,816 --> 00:08:27,011
還殺了我哥！
And you killed Ace!

71
00:08:27,144 --> 00:08:30,274
是他威脅要殺了我， 我才殺了他的
Hey, I only shot your brother once he threatened to shoot me.

72
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,336
我想我應該有...
And I do believe I have

73
00:08:32,348 --> 00:08:36,610
一，二，三，四，五...五個目擊證人支持我呢
one, two, three, four, five witnesses who can attest to that fact.

74
00:08:36,657 --> 00:08:38,462
把我的腿都打爆了！
Damn legs busted!

75
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,326
那是毫無疑問了。 現在你可以試著盡量叫得小點聲
No doubt. Now, if you can keep your caterwauling down to a minimum,

76
00:08:42,342 --> 00:08:45,406
我對小姜戈還有問題沒問完呢
I'd like to finish my line of inquiry with young Django.

77
00:08:49,685 --> 00:08:51,651
啊——啊——操你媽哦該死的...
God fucking dammit!

78
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:53,260
剛才說到，
As I was saying,

79
00:08:53,286 --> 00:08:57,127
如果你再見到布埵咱S弟， 能認出來嗎？
if you were to see the Brittle Brothers again, you could recognize them?

80
00:08:57,725 --> 00:08:58,925
可以
Yeah.

81
00:08:59,466 --> 00:09:01,940
成交！斯派克先生，
Sold American! So Mr. Speck,

82
00:09:02,144 --> 00:09:04,948
姜戈你開價多少？
Mr. Speck, how much for young Django here?

83
00:09:10,268 --> 00:09:12,668
這樁生意估計會很棘手啊
That iron is nasty business.

84
00:09:18,489 --> 00:09:20,622
幫我拿一下這個好嗎？
Could you hold this for a moment?

85
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:25,411
謝謝 姜戈，你騎那匹馬
Thank you. Django, get up on that horse.

86
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:32,251
還有如果我是你的話， 我會去拿那位去世了的斯派克老兄的大衣穿上
Also if I were you, I'd take that winter coat the dear departed Speck left behind.

87
00:09:45,997 --> 00:09:49,731
黑鬼，你膽敢碰我哥哥的大衣
Nigger, don't you touch my brother's coat!

88
00:10:01,431 --> 00:10:03,366
啊——！該死！
Goddammit!

89
00:10:07,547 --> 00:10:10,490
這堿O一百...十...
One hundred… ten…

90
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:14,835
二十五塊
twenty… and five…

91
00:10:15,765 --> 00:10:17,085
買姜戈的
for young Django here.

92
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:21,997
而且你哥也不在了，既然用不著， 我就連他的馬也一起買了吧
And since you won't be needing it anymore, I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.

93
00:10:22,582 --> 00:10:27,446
哦還有，斯派克先生， 我需要你給我開個發票
Also… Mr. Speck, I am afraid I will require a bill of sale.

94
00:10:27,592 --> 00:10:28,941
你有嗎？
Do you have one?

95
00:10:29,683 --> 00:10:31,792
去死吧，死牙醫！
You go to hell, dentist!

96
00:10:32,954 --> 00:10:34,194
我想也沒有
I thought not.

97
00:10:34,795 --> 00:10:36,425
別著急!
No worries!

98
00:10:36,563 --> 00:10:38,074
我有備而來
I come prepared.

99
00:10:42,848 --> 00:10:44,248
謝謝
Thank you.

100
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:48,406
這文書就跟發票效果一樣了
This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.

101
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,420
現在你們這些可憐人呢
Now as to you poor devils…

102
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:14,184
我覺得，既然你們需要考慮下一步該怎麼辦
So as I see it, when it comes to the subject of what to do next,

103
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:17,329
你們現在有兩個選擇
you gentlemen have two choices.

104
00:11:17,413 --> 00:11:22,629
一，我走了以後， 你們把馬從斯派克身上搬走，
One: once I'm gone, you could lift that beast off the remaining Speck,

105
00:11:22,646 --> 00:11:24,530
把他抬到最近的鎮上去
then carry him to the nearest town.

106
00:11:24,613 --> 00:11:28,277
也就是最少有37英里，從你們來的地方到這兒
Which would be at least thirty-seven miles back the way you came.

107
00:11:28,425 --> 00:11:30,243
或者，二，
Or Two:

108
00:11:30,486 --> 00:11:32,601
你們把鎖鏈解開，
You could unshackle yourselves…

109
00:11:32,811 --> 00:11:37,152
拿上那把槍，給他腦袋來一發 把他倆埋了，
take that rifle, put a bullet in his head, bury the two of them deep,

110
00:11:37,207 --> 00:11:40,567
然後找一個更開明自由的地方去吧
and then make your way to a more enlightened area of this country.

111
00:11:41,485 --> 00:11:42,825
選擇權在你們手上
The choice is yours.

112
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:47,679
哦還有， 你們中間是天文愛好者的應該不多吧
Oh, and on the off chance there are any astronomy aficionados amongst you,

113
00:11:47,694 --> 00:11:50,366
北極星是那邊那個
the North Star is that one.

114
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:53,041
拜拜咯
Tata.

115
00:12:09,931 --> 00:12:13,811
兄弟們等等，我們可以談談
Now wait a minute fellas, let's talk about this.

116
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:20,997
這種情況下你們更要講道理啊
You gotta be reasonable on a situation like this.

117
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,774
我又不是壞人，我只是做我本職
I'm not a bad guy, look I'm just doing my job!

118
00:12:25,821 --> 00:12:29,231
我最後一個蘋果不是還給你吃了嗎？
Blueberry, didn't I give you my last apple?

119
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:34,654
這麼跟你們說吧， 把我帶去埃爾帕索鎮上，你們就自由了
Tell you what boys, take me to Lit'le Duck in El Paso, I'll get you your freedom.

120
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:36,621
不，不
No. No, please-

121
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
德州多特

122
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
現在，這個藥晚上吃兩片， 然後到了白天...

123
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,700
騎在馬上的那個是黑人？

124
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:01,061
大家幹嘛都盯著看？
What's everybody staring at?

125
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:04,179
他們從沒見過黑人騎馬
They never seen a nigger on a horse before.

126
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:28,888
店老闆早上好
Good morning inn keeper!

127
00:14:30,556 --> 00:14:32,700
兩位疲勞的旅客想來杯啤酒
Two beers for two weary travelers.

128
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,995
現在還太早了
Ah, it's still a bit early.

129
00:14:35,052 --> 00:14:37,229
我們還要一個小時才開門
We won't be open for another hour.

130
00:14:37,683 --> 00:14:39,633
到時候我們會提供早餐的
By then we'll be servin' breakfast.

131
00:14:40,587 --> 00:14:42,407
喂，喂，喂！
Wow wow wow wow!

132
00:14:42,858 --> 00:14:44,723
你在幹嘛呢老兄，
What the hell you think you doin', boy?

133
00:14:45,097 --> 00:14:47,081
把那黑鬼轟出去
Get that nigger outta here.

134
00:14:52,347 --> 00:14:53,972
救命啊！救命！
Help! Help!

135
00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:55,241
店老闆！
Inn keeper!

136
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:58,853
記得去叫治安官，別叫警長啊
Remember, get the sheriff, not the marshall.

137
00:15:00,706 --> 00:15:02,106
Alas…

138
00:15:03,397 --> 00:15:06,397
看來我們只能自己給自己當酒保了
Now we must act as our own bartender.

139
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,010
坐下吧孩子
Sit down, my boy.

140
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:22,332
你是哪種牙醫啊？
What kinda dentist are you?

141
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,126
先不談那馬車吧， 我已經有五年沒有干牙醫的活兒了
Despite that cart, I haven't practiced dentistry in five years.

142
00:15:32,787 --> 00:15:35,747
最近呢我開發了新的職業...
These days I practice a new profession.

143
00:15:38,342 --> 00:15:40,441
賞金獵手
Bounty Hunter.

144
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,418
知道什麼是賞金獵手嗎？
D'you know what a Bounty Hunter is?

145
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:49,719
不知道
No.

146
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:50,930
Well…

147
00:15:52,646 --> 00:15:56,675
奴隸交易是用錢買活人對吧，
The way the slave trade deals in human lives for cash,

148
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:59,038
賞金獵手就是用錢買死人的
a bounty hunter deals in corpses.

149
00:16:05,668 --> 00:16:06,788
Prost.

150
00:16:15,397 --> 00:16:17,961
僱主會給某人的腦袋懸賞，
The state places a bounty on a man's head,

151
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:21,302
我就去追蹤，找到並且殺了那個人
I track that man, I find that man, I kill that man,

152
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:25,642
殺了他之後我就把他的屍體送回僱主
after I've killed him, I transport that man's corpse back to the authorities,

153
00:16:25,682 --> 00:16:27,860
現在說說還挺容易似的哈
and sometimes that's easier said then done,

154
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,769
我給他們看到屍體，證明， 我確實是
I show that corpse to the authorities proving, yes indeed,

155
00:16:30,784 --> 00:16:35,391
殺了這個人,然後呢， 僱主就可以給我賞金了
I truly have killed him, at which point the authorities pay me the bounty.

156
00:16:35,836 --> 00:16:39,695
跟奴隸買賣一樣，都是拿錢買人
So… like slavery, it's a flesh-for-cash business.

157
00:16:40,922 --> 00:16:42,482
賞金是什麼？
What's a bounty?

158
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,538
就像獎品
It's like a reward.

159
00:16:47,828 --> 00:16:50,828
你殺了人，別人還給你獎品？
You kill people and they give you a reward?

160
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:52,919
某些人是這樣的
Certain people, yeah.

161
00:16:53,082 --> 00:16:54,019
壞人？
Bad people?

162
00:16:55,464 --> 00:16:57,331
人越壞，獎品就越大
Aah!

163
00:16:55,464 --> 00:16:57,331
Badder they are, bigger the reward!

164
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,968
所以我才找到了你，
Which brings me to you.

165
00:17:00,798 --> 00:17:04,030
不過我必須承認現在的情況我還是有點困惑的
And I must admit that I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes to you.

166
00:17:05,452 --> 00:17:07,442
一方面，我鄙視奴隸制。
On one hand, I despise slavery.

167
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:09,520
但另一方面呢，
On the other hand…

168
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:13,844
我需要你的幫忙，所以假如不給你拒絕的權利， 那就再好不過了
I need your help, if you're not in a position to refuse, all the better.

169
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:19,607
所以現在我只能 用這奴隸制給我幫幫忙了
So for the time being, I'm gonna make this slave malarkey work to my benefit.

170
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:23,472
當然...我也說了，
Still… having said that…

171
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:25,868
我很有負罪感
I feel guilty.

172
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:28,252
所以...
So…

173
00:17:28,565 --> 00:17:32,393
我需要我們達成個協議
I would like the two of us to enter into an agreement.

174
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,846
我在找布埵咫T兄弟
 I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.

175
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:49,621
但這次我略微有點劣勢
However I've had this endeavor, I'm- I'm at a slight disadvantage,

176
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,049
目前為止，我都不知道他們長什麼樣
in so far as, I don't know what they look like.

177
00:17:53,734 --> 00:17:56,232
但是你知道。對吧？
But you do… don't you?

178
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:58,866
我很清楚他們的長相
I know what they look like, all right.

179
00:17:59,008 --> 00:17:59,693
好
Good.

180
00:18:00,573 --> 00:18:01,905
現在約定是這樣，
So here's my agreement.

181
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:04,874
你跟著我一路走，直到我們找到他們
You travel with me until we find them-

182
00:18:04,908 --> 00:18:05,952
朝哪堥哄H
Where we goin'?

183
00:18:06,505 --> 00:18:10,210
我聽說他們至少有兩個在蓋丁堡， 但不知道具體位置
I hear at least two of them are overseeing up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.

184
00:18:11,244 --> 00:18:15,921
也就是說我們要走訪蓋丁堡的每個農場 直到找到他們
That means we visit every plantation in Gatlinburg till we find them.

185
00:18:16,086 --> 00:18:17,591
等找到以後，
And when we find them…

186
00:18:18,273 --> 00:18:20,833
你指出他們，我來殺了他們
you point them out, and I kill them!

187
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,713
只要做到，我同意給你自由，
You do that, I agree to give you your freedom,

188
00:18:25,816 --> 00:18:30,080
還有每個人頭25美元...也就是一共75...
twenty-five dollars per Brittle brother -that's seventy-five dollars,

189
00:18:30,104 --> 00:18:34,281
說時遲啊那時快，治安官來了
and as if on cue, here comes the sheriff.

190
00:18:41,374 --> 00:18:44,819
好了，歡樂的時光結束了
Okay boys, fun's over.

191
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:47,699
出來吧
Come on out.

192
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:54,258
好了大傢伙兒，冷靜
All right folks, calm down.

193
00:18:55,063 --> 00:18:56,883
回去做自己的事吧
You bout your business.

194
00:18:57,998 --> 00:19:00,054
這倆人馬上就滾蛋了
The jokers will be gone soon.

195
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:03,034
我得問問…
Now…

196
00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:07,302
你們幹嘛來我的鎮上找麻煩，
why y'all wanna come into my town and start trouble,

197
00:19:07,578 --> 00:19:10,724
把這些良民都給嚇壞了
and… scare all these nice people?

198
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:14,847
就沒別的事情可做了嗎，
You ain't got nothin' better to do,

199
00:19:14,969 --> 00:19:21,232
敢來我比爾·夏普的鎮上，到處撒野！！
than to come into Bill Sharp's town and show your ass?

200
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,297
你都對我們治安官做了什麼？
What did you jus' do to our sheriff?

201
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:46,382
現在你可以去喊警長來了
Now you can get the marshall.

202
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:50,265
警長，警長！
Marshall, marshall!

203
00:19:50,411 --> 00:19:51,740
我們堶接尼a?
Should we wait inside?

204
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:53,019
我們能不能走？
Can't we just leave?

205
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,449
你先請
After you.

206
00:19:56,426 --> 00:20:00,658
把那塊板移開，移到馬路對面車那堨h
Move that buckboard long ways 'cross the street from the saloon!

207
00:20:01,006 --> 00:20:03,006
我要六個人，拿好槍
I want six men, six riffles behind it.

208
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,334
兩個人拿槍在這個屋頂，
I want two men, two rifles up on this roof,

209
00:20:06,354 --> 00:20:07,994
兩個在那個屋頂
two men two rifles on that roof.

210
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:11,055
槍桿全部對準前門
All the barrels aimed at that front door.

211
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:14,998
還有誰，把可憐的比爾從街上拖走啊
Somebody git poor Bill outta the goddamn street.

212
00:20:15,938 --> 00:20:17,452
堶悸漱H！
You in the saloon!

213
00:20:18,627 --> 00:20:21,351
門外已經佈滿了來復槍
We got a hundred riffles aimed on every way outta that buildin'!

214
00:20:22,515 --> 00:20:25,137
只有一個活著出來的機會
You got once chance git outta this alive!

215
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:29,164
你和你的黑鬼給我馬上出來，手舉在頭頂，
You and your nigger come out right now with your hands over your head,

216
00:20:29,164 --> 00:20:30,347
我是說，現在馬上！
and I mean, right now!

217
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:35,734
我是否有這個榮幸現在正跟警長對話？
Is this the marshall I have the pleasure of addressing?

218
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,336
是我
Yes it is.

219
00:20:37,812 --> 00:20:39,856
我是美利堅警長吉爾·塔圖姆
This is U.S. Marshall Gill Tatum.

220
00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:42,192
好極了！警長先生，
That wunderbar, marshall.

221
00:20:42,927 --> 00:20:46,299
我已經放下了全部武器
I have relieved myself of all weapons,

222
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,448
而且如你指示的，
and just as you have instructed,

223
00:20:49,722 --> 00:20:52,399
我正準備出來了
I am ready to step outside,

224
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:56,407
手也放到頭頂
with my hands raised above my head.

225
00:20:57,797 --> 00:20:58,677
我相信你，
I trust,

226
00:20:58,896 --> 00:21:03,818
作為美國司法部門的代表，
as a representative of the criminal justice system of The United States of America,

227
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:06,641
是不會活活打死我的
I shan't be shot down in the street,

228
00:21:07,076 --> 00:21:09,833
不管是你還是你的手下
by either you or your deputies,

229
00:21:09,943 --> 00:21:12,474
在我被法庭審判之前
before I've had my day in court.

230
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:14,776
你是說你剛才對治安官做的這一切？
You mean like you did our sheriff?

231
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:17,278
像打狗一樣打死了他！
Shot 'em down like a dog in the street!

232
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,675
我就是這個意思！
Yes, that's exactly what I mean!

233
00:21:19,754 --> 00:21:21,847
我有沒有你法律上的保證，
Do I have your word as a lawman,

234
00:21:21,923 --> 00:21:25,058
不會把我像狗一樣打死？
not to shoot me down like a dog in the street?

235
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:32,191
雖然那樣我們都會很喜聞樂見
Well, as much as we'd all enjoy seein' somethin' like that,

236
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:35,083
但我們鎮上沒人會騙你這種劊子手！
ain't nobody gonna cheat the hangman in my town.

237
00:21:36,353 --> 00:21:38,753
好的，那我們出來了
Fair enough marshall, here we come!

238
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,333
外面那幫人有點緊張過頭，
They're a little tense out there.

239
00:21:43,404 --> 00:21:47,292
所以你別亂動，讓我來說話
So don't make any quick movements, and let me do the talking.

240
00:21:48,527 --> 00:21:49,946
過來
Come ahead.

241
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:58,218
你沒拿槍吧？
You unarmed?

242
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,593
沒有
Yes indeed we are.

243
00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:04,160
塔圖姆警長，你，還有你的手下，
Marshall Tatum, may I address you and your deputies,

244
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,618
以及顯然整個多特娷穖ㄕb了，
and apparently the entire town of Daughtrey,

245
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,142
請允許我說明一下剛才的事
as to the incident that just occurred?

246
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:11,277
說
Go on.

247
00:22:12,989 --> 00:22:15,167
我是金·舒爾茲醫生，
My name is Dr. King Schultz,

248
00:22:15,178 --> 00:22:18,274
跟警長你一樣， 我也是為法庭做事的人
and like yourself, marshall, I am a servant of the court.

249
00:22:18,618 --> 00:22:20,418
剛才倒地身亡的那個人，
The man lying dead in the dirt,

250
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:24,225
多特娷磲漫~民把他選為治安官的，
who the good people of Daughtrey saw fit to elect as their sheriff,

251
00:22:24,421 --> 00:22:26,341
他自稱是比爾·夏普，
 who went by the name of Bill Sharp,

252
00:22:26,373 --> 00:22:30,831
但其實是一個在通緝的逃犯，叫威勒·派克
is actually a wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck,

253
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:33,588
他的人頭值兩百塊
with a price on his head of two hundred dollars.

254
00:22:33,784 --> 00:22:36,533
是死是活可都是兩百塊
Now, that's two hundred dollars, dead or alive.

255
00:22:36,991 --> 00:22:38,553
一派胡言！
The hell you say!

256
00:22:38,818 --> 00:22:42,308
我也知道這個消息會讓人很不安
I'm aware this is probably disconcerting news.

257
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:45,841
但我打賭這個人是過去兩年內
But I'm willing to wager this man was elected sheriff

258
00:22:46,034 --> 00:22:48,333
才被選為治安官的
sometime in the last two years.

259
00:22:50,372 --> 00:22:52,737
我知道這個，是因為三年前，
I know this because three years ago,

260
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:57,688
他還在德州盧伯克的克堮睅i牛場給牛刷毛
he was rustling cattle from the B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company of Lubbock, Texas.

261
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,695
我這埵酗@封
Now this is a warrant,

262
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:07,023
德州奧斯丁的 巡迴法庭法官亨利·阿倫·勞德米克簽的逮捕令
made out by circuit court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin Texas.

263
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,253
你可以給他發電報
You're encouraged to wire him.

264
00:23:09,434 --> 00:23:11,331
他會說明我的身份
He'll back up who I am,

265
00:23:11,551 --> 00:23:14,359
以及你們親愛的治安官過去叫啥
and who your dear departed sheriff was.

266
00:23:22,675 --> 00:23:24,175
換句話說呢警長，
In other words marshall,

267
00:23:24,746 --> 00:23:26,245
你還欠我兩百塊呢
you owe me two hundred dollars.

268
00:23:35,451 --> 00:23:36,691
沃槽...
I'll be damned.

269
00:24:04,836 --> 00:24:07,740
等布埵咱S弟這單活兒做完，
After this Brittle business is behind us…

270
00:24:08,783 --> 00:24:10,468
你就恢復自由身了，
you'll be a free man.

271
00:24:10,648 --> 00:24:14,858
還有一匹馬， 身上還有75塊錢
With a horse, seventy five dollars in your back pocket.

272
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:18,719
接下來有什麼打算
What's your plan after that?

273
00:24:20,643 --> 00:24:22,148
我要找到我老婆…
Find my wife…

274
00:24:23,071 --> 00:24:24,492
買回她的自由身
and buy her freedom.

275
00:24:26,677 --> 00:24:27,928
姜戈
Django…

276
00:24:29,018 --> 00:24:31,245
我都不知道你已經結婚了
I had no idea you were a married man.

277
00:24:32,322 --> 00:24:34,353
奴隸們也相信婚姻？
Do most slaves believe in marriage?

278
00:24:35,863 --> 00:24:37,313
我和我老婆相信
Me and my wife do.

279
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:40,228
卡拉坎農場的人都相信，所以我們才…
All men in Carrucan did, and that's why we uh…

280
00:24:41,312 --> 00:24:42,467
才逃走的
we run off.

281
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,170
姜戈…
Django…

282
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,065
姜戈，姜戈
Django, Django…

283
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:50,683
你態度很硬啊，姜戈
You got sand, Django.

284
00:24:52,063 --> 00:24:53,609
年輕人都這樣
Boy's got sand.

285
00:24:55,852 --> 00:24:58,842
但一個態度這麼硬的奴隸我不能要
I got no use for niggers with sand.

286
00:25:00,686 --> 00:25:03,605
你給他在臉上燙個「R」，說明他逃跑過
I want you to burn the runaway “r” right here on his cheek.

287
00:25:04,494 --> 00:25:06,494
那女的也是
And the girl too.

288
00:25:07,444 --> 00:25:10,355
你們把他們帶去格林威爾拍賣會
And I want you to take 'em to the Greenville auction,

289
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:12,199
把他賣了…
and sell 'em…

290
00:25:12,864 --> 00:25:14,264
他們倆
Both of 'em…

291
00:25:14,984 --> 00:25:17,506
分開賣
Separately.

292
00:25:19,407 --> 00:25:21,227
這個呢...
And this one…

293
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,577
賣個便宜價
you will sell him cheap.

294
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,442
在格林威爾...
In Greenville?

295
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:34,927
總會有個銷售記錄辦公室之類的
There should be some sort of a records office.

296
00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:43,914
你知道她賣出的時間
You know when she was sold…

297
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,830
你也知道她是哪堥茠
you know where she came from…

298
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,855
你也有她的名字...
and you know her name.

299
00:25:51,671 --> 00:25:53,128
她叫什麼名字？
What is her name?

300
00:25:53,723 --> 00:25:54,835
布隆希達
Broomhilda.

301
00:25:56,591 --> 00:25:57,442
什麼？
What?

302
00:25:57,784 --> 00:25:59,344
布隆希達
Broom-hilda.

303
00:26:00,157 --> 00:26:01,633
- 布隆希達？ - 嗯
– Broomhilda? – Hm-hm.

304
00:26:04,165 --> 00:26:05,576
她以前的農場主是德國人嗎？
Were her owners German?

305
00:26:05,921 --> 00:26:07,186
是啊，你怎麼知道？
Yeah, how you know?

306
00:26:07,993 --> 00:26:11,165
她不是卡拉坎農場出生的， 以前是由一位德國太太撫養的
She wan't born on The Carrucan Plantation, she was raised by a German mistress.

307
00:26:11,215 --> 00:26:12,360
姓范·夏夫特
Von Shafts.

308
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:13,807
她也能說一點德語
She speak a little German too.

309
00:26:14,316 --> 00:26:16,044
- 你老婆？ - 是啊
– Your wife? – Hm-hm.

310
00:26:16,352 --> 00:26:20,013
她小時候，太太教了她一些所以她能和周圍人說話
When she was little, her mistress taught her so she has somebody speak German with.

311
00:26:21,597 --> 00:26:23,516
所以讓我總結一下啊，
Alright, let me get this straight.

312
00:26:24,377 --> 00:26:28,964
你的老婆是奴隸，她說德語， 名字還叫布隆希達·范·夏夫特？
Your slave wife speaks German, and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?

313
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:29,906
正是
Yep.

314
00:26:34,324 --> 00:26:36,019
他們都叫我希爾蒂
They call me Hildi.

315
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
田納西州

316
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:56,550
等到了這些農場，
When we gain access to these plantations,

317
00:26:57,105 --> 00:26:59,456
我們就要像是演戲一樣了
we'll be putting on an “Act”.

318
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,307
你會扮演一個角色
You'll  be playing a character.

319
00:27:10,402 --> 00:27:11,522
嗯？
Hm?

320
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:13,389
不行？
No?

321
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,544
在演戲過程中， 你永遠不能打破角色做以外的事
But during the act, you can never break character.

322
00:27:26,232 --> 00:27:27,729
明白了？
D'you understand?

323
00:27:28,316 --> 00:27:30,837
不能打破角色，嗯
Yeah. Don't break character.

324
00:27:33,358 --> 00:27:36,895
你的角色呢就是「侍從」
And you character is that of the “Valet”.

325
00:27:37,794 --> 00:27:39,194
啥玩意
What that is?

326
00:27:40,421 --> 00:27:42,521
就是奴僕，說得好聽點而已
That's a fancy word for servant.

327
00:27:43,255 --> 00:27:45,366
－ 「侍從」 － 嗯
– “Valet”. – Hm-hm!

328
00:27:45,746 --> 00:27:49,970
姜戈，你現在可以為自己的角色選戲服了
And now Django, you may chose your character's costume.

329
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,297
我可以自己選自己的衣服了？
You want that I pick up my own clothes?

330
00:27:54,485 --> 00:27:56,531
當然！
You- but of course!

331
00:28:29,748 --> 00:28:33,460
黑人在這塊地方騎馬可是違法的
It's against the law for niggers to ride horses in this territory.

332
00:28:33,727 --> 00:28:36,896
這是我的侍從，我的侍從不走路的
This is my valet, my valet does not walk.

333
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,623
我說了，黑人騎馬...
I said niggers on horses-

334
00:28:39,631 --> 00:28:44,046
他叫姜戈，是自由身，想騎什麼就騎什麼
His name is Django, he's a free man, he can ride what he pleases.

335
00:28:44,118 --> 00:28:45,743
在我農場就不行
Not on my property.

336
00:28:45,838 --> 00:28:47,686
我的黑奴在，就不行
Not around my niggers he can't.

337
00:28:48,317 --> 00:28:49,963
這位先生
My good sir…

338
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:52,998
可能我們一開始沒說清楚
 perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.

339
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,769
讓我重新介紹一下。
Allow me to unring this bell.

340
00:28:56,043 --> 00:28:59,691
我是金·舒爾茲醫生， 這是我的侍從，姜戈
My name is Dr. King Schultz, this is my valet Django,

341
00:28:59,918 --> 00:29:02,490
這是我們的馬，托尼和弗堹
and these are our horses Tony and Fritz.

342
00:29:06,205 --> 00:29:07,036
本內特先生,
Mr. Bennett,

343
00:29:07,523 --> 00:29:12,187
我知道您是一位紳士，也是一位商人
I've been lead to believe that you are a gentleman, and a business man.

344
00:29:12,476 --> 00:29:15,473
我們才從德州 一路駕車來到田納西，
And it is for these attributes we've ridden from Texas

345
00:29:15,489 --> 00:29:17,656
跟您見面
to Tennessee to parley with you now.

346
00:29:18,884 --> 00:29:22,737
我想要從您這媔R一位黑奴
I wish to purchase one of your nigger gals.

347
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:29,586
你和你的狗腿從德州跑來田納西， 來買我的奴隸
You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to Tennessee, to buy one of my nigger gals?

348
00:29:29,743 --> 00:29:31,693
也不打個招呼？不是開玩笑吧
No appointment, no nuttin'?

349
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:33,506
我想就是這樣
Oh, I'm afraid so.

350
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:38,096
如果我說，我不喜歡你， 也不喜歡你這打扮奇怪的黑鬼
Well what if I had to say I don't like you, or your fancy pants nigger,

351
00:29:38,213 --> 00:29:40,179
我一塊破銅爛鐵都不會賣給你
and I wouldn't sell you a tinkers damn.

352
00:29:40,923 --> 00:29:42,648
你有什麼想說的嗎？
Now what'cha gotta say about that?

353
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:47,184
本內特先生,
Mr. Bennett,

354
00:29:48,293 --> 00:29:51,489
如果你真是一位商人 且如我聽說的那樣，
if you are the business man I've been led to believe you to be,

355
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:56,289
我這埵酗迨d個理由，可以讓你改變主意
I have five thousand things, I might say, that could change your mind.

356
00:30:00,793 --> 00:30:04,285
快進來，給你們拿點冷飲
Well com'on inside, and get yourself somethin' cool to drink.

357
00:30:05,486 --> 00:30:06,913
– Huh? – Hm-hm.

358
00:30:18,705 --> 00:30:20,859
或許我們談生意的時候呢，
Oh maybe, while we discuss business,

359
00:30:20,866 --> 00:30:23,296
你可以讓你親愛的黑人家僕
you could provide one of your loveliest black creatures

360
00:30:23,303 --> 00:30:26,222
給姜戈展示展示這了不起的莊園
to escort Django here around your magnificent grounds.

361
00:30:26,361 --> 00:30:28,604
沒問題，貝蒂娜！
Oh, absolutely! Eh, Betina!

362
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:29,675
我在，大老爹？
Yessir, Big Daddy?

363
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:32,013
你的跟班叫什麼名字來著？
Eh… What's your Jimmie name again?

364
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,849
姜戈
– Django. – Django.

365
00:30:33,952 --> 00:30:36,527
貝蒂娜，帶姜戈到處逛逛，
Betina sugar, could you take Django there,

366
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:39,746
給他看看這了不起的農場
and take him around the grounds here to show him all the pretty stuff.

367
00:30:39,887 --> 00:30:41,207
聽您吩咐，大老爹
As you please, Big Daddy.

368
00:30:41,258 --> 00:30:42,378
貝尼特先生，
Oh, Mr. Bennett,

369
00:30:42,802 --> 00:30:47,618
我必須提醒一下 姜戈是自由身，他不能被像奴隸一樣對待
I must remind you Django is a free man. He cannot be treated like a slave.

370
00:30:47,727 --> 00:30:51,352
在允許的範圍之內，他必須得到像我一樣的待遇
Within the bounds of good taste, he must be treated as an extension of myself.

371
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,611
明白了，舒爾茲，貝蒂娜聽到了？
Understood, Schultz. Betina, sugar?

372
00:30:53,672 --> 00:30:54,427
是的
Yes, sir?

373
00:30:54,577 --> 00:30:56,607
姜戈不是奴隸
Django isn't a slave.

374
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:59,544
姜戈是自由身，明白了？
Django is a free man. You understand?

375
00:31:00,673 --> 00:31:03,196
你不能像待其他黑鬼一樣待他，
You can't treat him like any of these other niggers around here,

376
00:31:03,209 --> 00:31:06,027
因為他不是其他黑鬼，明白了？
cause he ain't like any of these other niggers around here. Ya got it?

377
00:31:06,218 --> 00:31:09,036
你要我像對待白人一樣待他？
You wan' I should treat him like white folks?

378
00:31:09,216 --> 00:31:10,161
不，
No.

379
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:12,254
我沒這麼說
That's not what I said.

380
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,891
那我就不知道怎麼做了，大老爹
Then I don't know what'cha want, Big Daddy.

381
00:31:15,496 --> 00:31:17,704
能看出來
Yes… I can see that.

382
00:31:17,986 --> 00:31:19,106
Uh…

383
00:31:20,216 --> 00:31:24,074
那個從鎮上來的修玻璃窗的小子叫什麼？
What's the name of that peckawood boy from town that works with the glass?

384
00:31:24,707 --> 00:31:26,666
他媽媽在木材廠工作的？
His mama works at the lumber yard.

385
00:31:27,007 --> 00:31:28,127
噢，你是說傑瑞
Oh, you mean Jerry.

386
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,913
對，那個小孩叫傑瑞
That's the boy's name, Jerry!

387
00:31:29,998 --> 00:31:31,374
你知道傑瑞吧？
You know Jerry, don't you sugar?

388
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:32,686
是的，大老爹
Yes 'em, Big Daddy.

389
00:31:33,069 --> 00:31:34,561
那就是了，
Well that's it then…

390
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:37,362
就像對待傑瑞一樣對待他
You just treat 'em like you would Jerry.

391
00:31:44,471 --> 00:31:47,359
我們剛才從「大宅」那媢L來
The house we just left from, is the big house.

392
00:31:47,617 --> 00:31:50,417
大老爹這樣叫的，因為那房子是很大
Big daddy call it that, cause it's big.

393
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,816
那個是儲藏室
That there is the pantry.

394
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:56,798
大老爹把平時吃的肉都放在那
That's where Bid Daddy hang out his day meat.

395
00:31:57,687 --> 00:31:59,662
堶悼是松鼠
Full o'squirrels.

396
00:32:01,371 --> 00:32:03,771
你是為你主人做什麼的？
What'cha do for your massa'?

397
00:32:04,154 --> 00:32:05,840
沒聽到他說嗎，我不是奴隸？
Didn't you hear him tell ya I ain't no slave?

398
00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:07,105
所以你是真的自由了？
So you really free?

399
00:32:07,152 --> 00:32:08,352
就是這樣
Yes. I as free.

400
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:10,869
那你是說，是你自己想要穿成這樣的？
You mean you wanna dress like that?

401
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,074
貝蒂娜，我有事情要問你

我不認識他們
I don't know dem.

409

他們可能改了別的名字
They could be usin' a different name.

410
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:33,300
他們這過去一年有可能來過這個農場
They would have come to the plantation this past year.

411
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:35,029
你是說夏弗兄弟？

－ 他們在這？ － 嗯
– Are they here? – Ah-huh.

415
00:32:40,618 --> 00:32:42,231
能給我指出來嗎？
Could you point one of 'em out to me?

416
00:32:42,448 --> 00:32:44,836
一個在那邊地
Well one's over in that field.

417
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:01,155
如果老卡拉坎還在， 是不會喜歡你這樣做的…
Old man Carrucan ain't going to appreciate this now, she- she-

418
00:33:01,169 --> 00:33:03,159
她是在屋子堶掠筐う滿A約翰， 你這樣會把她的皮膚都毀了
she work in a house, John, you could mess her skin up,

419
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:04,557
要是毀了，她就…
and you gonna mess it up, she ain't gonna be worth no-

420
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:06,080
就一文不值了
she ain't gonna worth a damn thing.

421
00:33:06,101 --> 00:33:07,309
就像聖經說的...
Like- like the bible say…

422
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:15,016
聽著，我告訴你了，是我逼她這樣做的
Look, I- I told you, I was the one to make her do it.

423
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:16,469
準備好了？
You're ready?

424
00:33:16,553 --> 00:33:18,764
她是跟著我才這樣的， 現在被鞭子打的人，
She the one who went up for me and, thing about you we gettin' whipped now,

425
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:22,199

427
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,411

You know master Carrugen ain't gonna appreciate this!

428
00:33:35,451 --> 00:33:37,271
她是…她是家僕！
She's- she's a house slave!

429
00:33:41,261 --> 00:33:44,696
<i>?7?8尋找自由</i>
<i>?Looking for freedom</i>

430
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:49,280
<i>?7?8尋找自由</i>
<i>?Looking for freedom ah-aah</i>

431
00:34:00,818 --> 00:34:01,938
求，求你了
Please, please now.

432
00:34:01,972 --> 00:34:04,594
如果這就是你想要的，讓我可憐兮兮地求饒...
If this what you want, to keep me funny fighting for each other, please…

433
00:34:11,947 --> 00:34:14,225
我喜歡你求饒的樣子
I like the way you beg, boy.

434
00:34:17,741 --> 00:34:19,716
是你要找的人嗎？
Is that who you was lookin' for?

435
00:34:21,892 --> 00:34:22,880
正是
Yep.

436
00:34:24,246 --> 00:34:25,525
另外兩個呢？
Where the other two of 'em?

437
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:29,321
他們在馬廄那堙A小朱迪剛才打碎了雞蛋， 他們正在懲罰她
They by the stable, punishin' Little Jody for breakin' eggs.

438
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,248
他們在打小朱迪？
They whippin' Little Jody?

439
00:34:31,851 --> 00:34:33,651
給我指一下那個方向
Point me in that direction.

440
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,176
走到那棵樹，一直走
You go to that tree, and keep goin' that way.

441
00:34:42,276 --> 00:34:44,676
把那個跟我一起來的男人叫來
Go git that white man I came here with.

442
00:34:46,018 --> 00:34:48,331
來吧，來吧朱迪！
Com'on now. Com'on, Jody!

443
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:51,716
讓我...把你安頓安頓
Let me all… get you set up!

444
00:34:51,778 --> 00:34:54,283
主說，害怕...
And the Lord said the fear of ye…

445
00:34:55,524 --> 00:34:57,358
和恐懼...
and the dread of ye…

446
00:34:57,499 --> 00:34:59,903
是屬於每個人的
shall be on every beast of here.

447
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:04,354
嘿，給我，把手給我
Hey, gimme that of what? You better gimme that arm,

448
00:35:04,363 --> 00:35:06,486
把手給我！
you gotta gimme that arm!

449
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,566
好了她準備好了！
Okay, she ready!

450
00:35:38,713 --> 00:35:43,093
完事兒之後，瞧瞧你敢不敢再打碎雞蛋了
And after this, we'll see if you break eggs again.

451
00:35:46,268 --> 00:35:47,828
約翰·布埵哄I
John Brittle!

452
00:36:08,969 --> 00:36:10,529
記得我嗎？
Remember me?

453
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:25,013
我喜歡你去死的樣子！
I like the way you die, boy!

454
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:33,032
該死的狗娘養的！
Goddamn son-of-a-bitch!

455
00:37:18,011 --> 00:37:19,594
你們還想繼續看吧？
Ya'all wanna see somethin'?

456
00:37:22,431 --> 00:37:23,551
噢不！
Ooh no!

457
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:36,283
他們是誰？
Who are they?

458
00:37:37,098 --> 00:37:39,720
這個是大約翰，那個是小拉什
That's Big John, and that's little Raj.

459
00:37:40,223 --> 00:37:41,252
埃利斯呢？
Where's Ellis?

460
00:37:41,813 --> 00:37:44,217
就那邊田里正在拚命逃跑的那個
He's the one hightailin' it across that field right now.

461
00:37:49,155 --> 00:37:50,418
－ 你確定那個是他？ － 嗯
– You sure that's him? – Yeah.

462
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,402
－ 毫無疑問嗎？ － 我也不知道
– Positive? – I dunno.

463
00:37:52,793 --> 00:37:55,033
－ 你不知道自己肯不肯定？ － 「毫無疑問」是什麼意思我不知道
– You don't know if you're positive? – I don't know what positive means.

464
00:37:55,087 --> 00:37:56,073
就是說你打包票
It means you're sure.

465
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:57,206
－ 是 － 是什麼？
– Yes. – Yes, what?

466
00:37:57,261 --> 00:37:58,822
是我肯定那個是埃利斯·布埵
Yes I'm sure it is Ellis Brittle.

467
00:38:12,104 --> 00:38:13,924
「毫無疑問」他已經死了
I'm positive he dead.

468
00:38:18,894 --> 00:38:19,917
姜戈！
Django!

469
00:38:21,694 --> 00:38:24,105
大家冷靜
Everybody calm down,

470
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,496
我們不會傷害其他任何人
we mean no one else any harm.

471
00:38:26,553 --> 00:38:28,292
你們倆到底是誰？
Who are you two jokers?

472
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,271
我是金·舒爾茲醫生，
I am Dr. King Schultz, a legal representative

473
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:34,675
是美國犯罪法庭的執行代表，
of the criminal justice system of the United States of America,

474
00:38:34,683 --> 00:38:38,338
左邊這位是自由人姜戈，我的副手
the man to my left is Django Freeman, he's my deputy.

475
00:38:38,966 --> 00:38:41,030
我的口袋埵雀e捕令
In my pocket is a warrant

476
00:38:41,045 --> 00:38:45,448
德州奧斯汀的法官 亨利·阿倫·勞德米克簽署的
signed by circuit court judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin Texas,

477
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:50,120
不管死活，都需要逮捕以下三人，
for the arrest and capture, dead or alive, of

478
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:54,599
約翰·布埵哄A羅傑·布埵哄A 還有埃利斯·布埵
John Brittle, Roger Brittle, and Ellis Brittle.

479
00:38:54,805 --> 00:38:57,013
他們姓夏弗
They've gone by the name Shaffer.

480
00:38:58,183 --> 00:39:02,214
那是你們聽說他們叫夏弗， 這幾個屠夫真名叫布埵
You know them by the name of Shaffer, but the butchers real name was Brittle.

481
00:39:02,531 --> 00:39:05,989
他們都是通緝犯，法律要置他們死地
These are wanted men. The law wants them for murder.

482
00:39:06,051 --> 00:39:10,395
再重申一遍，逮捕令說了，不管死活
Now I reiterate, the warrant states dead or alive,

483
00:39:10,442 --> 00:39:13,705
所以我的副手和我剛才殺了他們
so when Mr. Freeman and myself executed these men on sight,

484
00:39:13,822 --> 00:39:17,241
是在法律規定的範圍內的
we were operating within our legal boundaries.

485
00:39:18,142 --> 00:39:19,772
我認識到…
I realize…

486
00:39:20,015 --> 00:39:22,768
你們很激動
passions are high,

487
00:39:22,911 --> 00:39:24,963
但我必須警告你們
but I must warn you,

488
00:39:25,103 --> 00:39:28,336
威脅恐嚇法庭官員是會被懲罰的
the penalty for taking deadly force against a office of the court

489
00:39:28,353 --> 00:39:30,389
尤其在他執行任務的時候
in the performance of his duty is,

490
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:33,055
你們會被活活吊死哦
you will be hung by the neck until you're dead.

491
00:39:36,761 --> 00:39:41,266
需要我從口袋堮野X逮捕令來給你看看嗎？
May I please remove the warrant from my pocket so you may examine it?

492
00:39:43,391 --> 00:39:44,951
給我
Gimmie.

493
00:40:01,096 --> 00:40:02,421
滿意了？
Satisfied?

494
00:40:09,104 --> 00:40:10,904
我能拿回來了吧？
May I have that back, please?

495
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,825
滾出我的地盤
Get off my land.

496
00:40:18,372 --> 00:40:19,492
馬上馬上
Post haste.

497
00:40:20,556 --> 00:40:23,655
快點把屍體裝起來
Load up the bodies as quickly as you can,

498
00:40:23,665 --> 00:40:25,533
我們趕緊走吧
and let's get out of here.

499
00:40:50,678 --> 00:40:51,798
該死的
Hell…

500
00:40:52,463 --> 00:40:54,390
就是他們這兩個狗娘養的
That's 'em sonsabitches.

501
00:41:50,734 --> 00:41:54,526
除非他們先動手，我們不能開槍
Now unless they start shootin' first… nobody shoot 'em.

502
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,868
對付這倆人再簡單不過了吧
That's way too simple for these jokers.

503
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,649
我們要把那個跟黑鬼在一起的傢伙抽死
We're gonna whip that nigger lover to death.

504
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:05,521
我本人要親自把他抽筋扒皮
And I'm gonna personally strip and clip that garboon myself.

505
00:42:09,855 --> 00:42:10,975
該死…
Damn…

506
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,031
我戴著這個屁都看不見啊
I can't see fuckin' shit outta this thing.

507
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:17,196
我們到底準備好了沒啊
We ready, or what?

508
00:42:17,274 --> 00:42:20,295
等等，我屁都看不見啊
Ah hold on, I'm fuckin' with my eye holes.

509
00:42:21,562 --> 00:42:22,536
該死
Oh shit.

510
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,825
弄得更糟糕了
I just made it worse.

511
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,960
這貨到底誰做的啊？
Who made this goddamn shit?

512
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:27,976
威勒的老婆
Willard's wife.

513
00:42:28,055 --> 00:42:29,990
那他媽的自己做面罩啊！
W?ll m?k? y?u ?wn g?dd?mn m??k?!

514
00:42:30,057 --> 00:42:33,906
沒人說他們不感謝詹妮做的面罩啊
Look, nobody's sayin' they don't appreciate what Jenny did.

515
00:42:33,938 --> 00:42:36,469
如果只是需要在袋子上割個洞，
Well if all I hadda do was cut a hole in a bag,

516
00:42:36,644 --> 00:42:38,430
我應該能弄得比這好吧
I coulda cut it better than this.

517
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:40,910
羅伯特？你能看到嗎？
How 'bout you Robert, can you see?

518
00:42:41,317 --> 00:42:42,728
看不太清楚
Not too good.

519
00:42:42,908 --> 00:42:47,190
我是說，如果我保持頭不動，那還能看清
I mean, if I don't move my head, I can see pretty good, more or less.

520
00:42:47,284 --> 00:42:50,945
但如果開始騎馬，這個袋子就亂動， 我就只能盲騎了
But when I start ridin', the bag's moving all over, and I'm ridin' blind.

521
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:52,382
該死！
Oh shit!

522
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,421
我把我的也弄壞了
I just made mine worse.

523
00:42:57,357 --> 00:42:58,987
有誰帶了備用的嗎？
Anybody bring any extra bags?

524
00:42:58,984 --> 00:43:02,153
沒人會帶備用的！
No, nobody brought an extra bag!

525
00:43:02,357 --> 00:43:03,903
只是問問而已啊
I'm just asking.

526
00:43:04,052 --> 00:43:05,901
騎馬的時候也必須戴著嗎？
Do we hafta wear 'em when we ride?

527
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:07,534
你們都在想什麼呢？
Oh well Shitfire!

528
00:43:07,591 --> 00:43:10,635
如果騎馬的時候不戴面罩， 那我們的初衷是什麼啊？
If you don't wear 'em as you ride up, that just defeats the purpose.

529
00:43:10,651 --> 00:43:12,500
戴著這個我他媽的看不見路啊！
Well I can't see in this fucking thing!

530
00:43:12,592 --> 00:43:15,678
呼吸都不能了，更看不見路啊！
I can't breathe in this fucking thing, and I can't ride in this fucking thing!

531
00:43:15,724 --> 00:43:17,724
去你們的吧，我回家了！
Well fuck all y'all, I'm going home!

532
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,449
我看著我老婆工作了一整天
Ya know I watched my wife work all day

533
00:43:20,512 --> 00:43:24,368
就給你們這些不知感謝的小兔崽子 縫了30個面罩
gettin' thirty bags to get ready for you ungrateful sonsabitches,

534
00:43:24,395 --> 00:43:27,994
你們就知道抱怨，抱怨，抱怨
and all I hear is criticize, criticize, criticize.

535
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:31,689
從現在開始，別想不給錢就讓我做事了！
From now on, don't ask me or mine for nothin'!

536
00:43:32,757 --> 00:43:33,877
聽著...
Now look…

537
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:35,762
別忘了我們為什麼來的
Let's not forget why we're here.

538
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,595
我們是來殺山上那個黑鬼的
We gotta killer nigger over that hill there.

539
00:43:39,103 --> 00:43:40,595
給他們好好上一課
And we gotta make a lesson outta 'em.

540
00:43:40,629 --> 00:43:41,924
我不懂了
Okay, I'm confused.

541
00:43:42,042 --> 00:43:43,746
袋子戴著還是拿掉啊
Are the bags on or off.

542
00:43:44,723 --> 00:43:49,681
我覺得…我們都覺得… 用這袋子挺好的
I think… we all think… the bags was a nice idea.

543
00:43:49,709 --> 00:43:50,712
－ 是啊 － 是啊
– Yeah. – Yeah.

544
00:43:50,752 --> 00:43:54,788
但我沒有別的意思啊， 它們完全可以做得更好吧
But not pointing 'ny fingers, they could have been done better.

545
00:43:55,961 --> 00:43:59,036
所以要不然…這次就不戴了
So how about… no bags this time,

546
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:04,781
但下次，我們把袋子弄好點， 然後就全副武裝
 but next time, we do the bags right, and then we go full regalia.

547
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:06,944
我拿下來了
I get my bag off.

548
00:44:07,025 --> 00:44:08,163
等等！
Wait a minute!

549
00:44:08,538 --> 00:44:10,007
我沒說不用戴了啊
I didn't say no bags.

550
00:44:10,553 --> 00:44:12,353
但沒人能看見路啊
But nobody can see.

551
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:13,772
所以？
So?

552
00:44:13,937 --> 00:44:16,069
所以，看見路更好啊
So, it be nice to see.

553
00:44:16,269 --> 00:44:18,546
該死的！這可是突襲好嗎！
Goddamit! This is a raid!

554
00:44:18,851 --> 00:44:21,747
我看不見，你也看不見，那又怎樣啊！
I can't see, you can't see. So what?

555
00:44:22,078 --> 00:44:24,317
關鍵是馬能看見不就行了嗎！
All that matters is can the fuckin' horse see!

556
00:44:24,749 --> 00:44:25,797
這才是突襲！
That's a raid!

557
00:44:29,997 --> 00:44:31,117
跑哪去了！
Where's this shit!

558
00:44:32,163 --> 00:44:33,283
他在那！
There he is!

559
00:44:33,301 --> 00:44:35,895
把那黑鬼從馬車下面弄出來
Get that nigger out from under 'at wagon.

560
00:44:36,366 --> 00:44:38,449
把那白人也從馬車堜鴠X來！
And get that nigger lover out o'the wagon!

561
00:44:38,604 --> 00:44:39,746
黑鬼不在馬車下面！
That nigger ain't down here!

562
00:44:39,801 --> 00:44:40,921
－ 他們跑了！ － 什麼？
– They're gone! – What?

563
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:42,689
－ 我們被他們耍了！ － 那他們到哪去了？
– They tricked us! – Well where are they?

564
00:44:43,401 --> 00:44:44,369
拜拜咯（德語）
Auf wiedersehen.

565
00:44:52,099 --> 00:44:53,899
殺起來
Bull time.

566
00:44:56,481 --> 00:44:57,601
我們現在殺了他們吧
We get 'em now.

567
00:45:02,736 --> 00:45:04,468
膽小鬼才這樣
Cowards tend to do that.

568
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:14,670
該死！
Goddammit!

569
00:45:18,822 --> 00:45:20,015
你想來嗎？
Would you care to?

570
00:45:27,236 --> 00:45:29,017
戴著這個真是屁都看不見...
I can't see shit out of this…

571
00:45:29,845 --> 00:45:30,874
他要跑了
He's getting away.

572
00:45:30,967 --> 00:45:31,803
我能搞定
I got 'em.

573
00:45:33,934 --> 00:45:35,522
大老爹要逃走咯
Big Daddy's getting away.

574
00:45:35,569 --> 00:45:37,129
我能搞定
I got 'em.

575
00:45:52,146 --> 00:45:53,221
搞定了
Got 'em.

576
00:45:59,211 --> 00:46:00,810
這距離可不近啊
For kids, ain't that short.

577
00:46:11,886 --> 00:46:14,886
你怎麼知道布隆希達的第一任主人是德國人？
How you know Broomhilda's first masters were German?

578
00:46:15,824 --> 00:46:17,353
布隆希達就是個德國名字
Broomhilda is a German name.

579
00:46:17,978 --> 00:46:20,595
如果是他們給她命名的， 那他們就很有可能是德國人咯
If they named her, it stands to reason they'd be German.

580
00:46:21,093 --> 00:46:23,286
你老家有很多女的叫布隆希達嗎？
Lots of gals where you from named Broomhilda?

581
00:46:23,973 --> 00:46:26,966
布隆希達是一個故事角色的名字
Broomhilda is the name of a character

582
00:46:27,116 --> 00:46:30,582
德國的傳說中最有名的一個
in the most popular of all the German legends.

583
00:46:31,278 --> 00:46:33,228
布隆希達還有傳說的？
There's a story 'bout Broomhilda?

584
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:34,533
哦那當然有了
Oh yes, there is.

585
00:46:41,187 --> 00:46:42,468
你知道是什麼嗎？
Do you know it?

586
00:46:42,615 --> 00:46:44,390
每個德國人都知道的
Every German knows that story.

587
00:46:50,999 --> 00:46:52,891
想讓我告訴你嗎？
Would you like me to tell you?

588
00:46:54,027 --> 00:46:55,269
好吧...
Well…

589
00:46:56,054 --> 00:46:59,684
布隆希達是個公主
Broomhilda was a… princess.

590
00:47:01,575 --> 00:47:06,361
她是沃坦的女兒，沃坦是萬神之神
She was the daughter of Wotan, the god of all gods.

591
00:47:06,788 --> 00:47:10,114
總之反正吧，她的父親因為她變得非常生氣
 Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

592
00:47:10,213 --> 00:47:11,773
她做什麼了？
What she do?

593
00:47:12,716 --> 00:47:16,364
我也記不清了 可能是某方面違反了他的命令
I can't exactly remember. I think she disobeys him in some way.

594
00:47:17,065 --> 00:47:20,367
所以他就把她置於山頂
So he puts her on top of the mountain.

595
00:47:20,548 --> 00:47:22,178
布隆希達在山頂？
Broomhilda's on a mountain?

596
00:47:22,238 --> 00:47:25,662
這是德國傳說啊， 故事媮`會有哪堳_出這麼一座山的吧
It's a German legend, there's always going to be a mountain in there somewhere.

597
00:47:26,186 --> 00:47:30,183
然後他還派了一隻噴火的龍來保衛這座山
And he puts a fire breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.

598
00:47:32,157 --> 00:47:34,373
她身邊就圍繞著...
And he surrounds her…

599
00:47:34,926 --> 00:47:37,662
地獄之火
 in a circle of hellfire.

600
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:43,442
所以布隆希達就只能困在那
And there, Broomhilda shall remain,

601
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:49,840
直到有足夠勇敢的英雄去解救她
unless a hero arises brave enough to save her.

602
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:52,419
有這樣一個人出現嗎？
Does a fella arise?

603
00:47:52,535 --> 00:47:55,341
是的姜戈，的確有這樣一個人
Yes Django. As a matter of fact, he does.

604
00:47:55,678 --> 00:47:57,886
一個叫西格弗媦w的人
A fella named Sigfried.

605
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,140
那他救了她嗎？
Does Sigfried save her?

606
00:48:01,815 --> 00:48:04,055
是的，很壯觀的
Quite spectacularly so.

607
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:09,779
他震懾了這座山，因為他毫無畏懼
He scales the mountain, because he's not afraid of it.

608
00:48:10,052 --> 00:48:13,846
殺死了那條龍，因為他毫無畏懼
He slays the dragon, because he's not afraid of him.

609
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:17,008
穿過地獄之火...
And he walks through hellfire…

610
00:48:18,978 --> 00:48:21,672
因為為了布隆希達，這一切值得
because Broomhilda's worth it.

611
00:48:25,576 --> 00:48:27,376
我明白他的感受
I know how he feel.

612
00:48:28,798 --> 00:48:31,798
我覺得現在我也開始有點明白了
I think I'm just starting to realize that.

613
00:48:37,228 --> 00:48:41,371
聽著，姜戈…
Now… Look… Django…

614
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:48,212
毫無疑問，總有一天，你會救出你的愛人
I don't doubt that one day you will save your lady love.

615
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:52,731
但我不能讓你沒認清形勢 就貿然去格林威爾
But I can't let you go to Greenville in a good conscious.

616
00:48:54,275 --> 00:48:58,225
密西西比州的奴隸首都啊， 你不能去
Slave Washington, in Mississippi, isn't a place for you to visit.

617
00:48:58,739 --> 00:49:00,921
不管你是不是自由身，那都太危險了
Free or not, it's just too dangerous.

618
00:49:04,582 --> 00:49:06,782
現在我有個問題要問你
But let me ask you a question.

619
00:49:14,185 --> 00:49:16,385
你覺得賞金獵手這職業怎樣？
How do you like the bounty hunting business?

620
00:49:18,149 --> 00:49:20,093
殺白人，還有錢拿？
Kill white folks, and they pay you for it?

621
00:49:21,304 --> 00:49:22,448
有哪點不喜歡哪
What's not to like?

622
00:49:22,815 --> 00:49:25,101
我必須承認，我們合作得不錯
And I have to admit, we make a good team.

623
00:49:25,565 --> 00:49:28,133
我以為我殺了大約翰和小拉什以後 你還在生我的氣
I thought you was mad at me for killin' Big John and Lit'le Raj?

624
00:49:28,226 --> 00:49:30,426
啊，那次啊，你的確有點過分熱心了
Yeah, on that occasion, you were a tad overzealous,

625
00:49:30,528 --> 00:49:32,048
但通常來說這都是好事
but normally, that's a good thing.

626
00:49:33,423 --> 00:49:35,627
你覺得這個冬天我們繼續合作怎樣？
How'd you like to partner up for the winter?

627
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:37,630
繼續合作是什麼意思？
What'd ya mean partner up?

628
00:49:38,172 --> 00:49:41,827
冬天你和我一起做事，直到春天冰雪融化
You work with me through the winter till the snow melts.

629
00:49:43,334 --> 00:49:45,574
我的賞金分你三分之一
I give you a third of my bounties.

630
00:49:46,465 --> 00:49:50,212
冬天我們可以好好掙點錢， 等到了雪融化的時候，
So we make some money this winter, and when the snow melts,

631
00:49:50,885 --> 00:49:56,531
我會親自帶你去格林威爾， 弄清楚他們把你老婆賣去了哪
I'll take you to Greenville myself, and we'll find where they sent your wife.

632
00:50:01,106 --> 00:50:02,806
你為什麼要關心我的事？
Why you care what happen to me?

633
00:50:04,615 --> 00:50:06,440
為什麼要關心我能不能找到我老婆？
Why you care if I find my wife?

634
00:50:06,855 --> 00:50:08,255
很顯然...
Frankly…

635
00:50:09,652 --> 00:50:12,312
我以前從未賦予過誰人身自由
I've never given anybody their freedom before.

636
00:50:12,367 --> 00:50:16,032
現在我做到了， 就自認為對你是有責任的
And now that I have, I feel vaguely responsible for you.

637
00:50:17,463 --> 00:50:20,837
再說了，我一個德國人碰到了真人版 的西格弗媦w耶，這可是大事
Plus when a German meets a real life Sigfried, that's kind of a big deal.

638
00:50:23,715 --> 00:50:26,298
作為一個德國人，我必須幫助你
As a German, I'm obliged to help you

639
00:50:26,306 --> 00:50:28,979
幫你解救心愛的布隆希達
on your quest to rescue your beloved Broomhilda.

640
00:52:46,617 --> 00:52:50,958
哦唷，「殺白人換錢」先生到哪去啦？
Ooh, what happened to mister “I wanna shoot white folks for money”?

641
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:52,901
他兒子跟他在一起呢
His son's with him.

642
00:52:53,243 --> 00:52:56,018
那更好，他還有心愛的人陪著死
Well good. He'll have a loved one with him.

643
00:52:56,409 --> 00:52:58,404
甚至可以分享互相的遺言呢
Maybe even share a last word.

644
00:53:00,841 --> 00:53:02,639
這比大多數人好多啦
That's better then most of them get,

645
00:53:03,016 --> 00:53:05,029
跟他應得的報應比起來，更是好多了
and a damn sight better then he deserves.

646
00:53:13,495 --> 00:53:15,141
把槍放下
Put down the rifle.

647
00:53:17,805 --> 00:53:19,164
別擔心，我沒生氣
Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.

648
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,065
把史密蒂·巴考爾的傳單拿出來
Just take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.

649
00:53:26,558 --> 00:53:27,782
大聲念
Read it aloud.

650
00:53:28,924 --> 00:53:30,946
當作今天的課程
Consider that today's lesson.

651
00:53:33,198 --> 00:53:35,664
通緝令，死活皆可
Wanted, dead or alive.

652
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:39,289
史密蒂·巴考爾和史密蒂·巴考爾的...
Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall…

653
00:53:41,373 --> 00:53:42,493
團伙
gang.

654
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:47,969
他們犯有謀殺和馬車搶…
For murder and stagecoach ro…

655
00:53:48,532 --> 00:53:49,652
搶劫罪
robbery.

656
00:53:50,181 --> 00:53:51,835
七零零零…
Seven zero zero ze-

657
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:52,663
七千
Seven thousand.

658
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:54,499
– 七... – 千
– Seven- – Thousand.

659
00:53:54,827 --> 00:53:58,457
史密蒂·巴考爾賞金七千
“Seven thousand dollars for Smitty Bacall,

660
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:05,221
賞金一千五，他的團伙的每一個...
one thousand and five hundred dollars for each of his gang

661
00:54:07,374 --> 00:54:08,944
– 成… – 成員
– memb… – members.

662
00:54:09,687 --> 00:54:14,153
已經知道的史密蒂·巴考爾團伙有以...
Known members of the Smitty Bacall Gang are as fellows,

663
00:54:14,466 --> 00:54:15,895
– 以下 – 以下
– follows. – follows.

664
00:54:16,637 --> 00:54:19,603
丹迪·邁克爾斯，傑拉德·納什，還有...
Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash and…

665
00:54:21,457 --> 00:54:22,939
瘋子克雷格·庫恩斯
Crazy Craig Koons.

666
00:54:24,158 --> 00:54:26,884
那就是史密蒂·巴考爾
That is who Smitty Bacall is.

667
00:54:27,156 --> 00:54:29,864
如果史密蒂·巴考爾22歲就開始務農，
If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at twenty-two,

668
00:54:29,872 --> 00:54:31,932
就永遠不會有這張紙了
they would never have printed that.

669
00:54:32,393 --> 00:54:35,750
但是史密蒂·巴考爾呢，他搶劫了馬車
But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches,

670
00:54:36,091 --> 00:54:38,643
為了搶劫還殺人不眨眼
and he didn't mind killing people to do it.

671
00:54:39,252 --> 00:54:42,460
你想要跟我做同樣的事情，來拯救你老婆嗎？
D'you want to save your wife by doing what I do?

672
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,012
我就是做這個的
This is what I do.

673
00:54:45,408 --> 00:54:48,653
我殺人，賣屍體換錢
I kill people, and sell their corpses for cash.

674
00:54:49,801 --> 00:54:52,681
這具屍體可值七千塊呢
This corpse is worth seven thousand dollars.

675
00:54:53,635 --> 00:54:55,995
好了別畏畏縮縮的了，給他來一槍吧
Now quit your pussyfootin' and shoot him.

676
00:55:06,122 --> 00:55:07,299
爸爸？
Pa?

677
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:08,768
爸！
Pa!

678
00:55:17,433 --> 00:55:18,553
拿著...
Here…

679
00:55:19,137 --> 00:55:21,298
你得留著這張史密蒂·巴考爾的傳單
You need to keep this Smitty Bacall handbill.

680
00:55:21,427 --> 00:55:22,197
為什麼？
Why?

681
00:55:22,354 --> 00:55:23,664
代表好運的
It's good luck.

682
00:55:23,797 --> 00:55:26,523
第一筆賞金的傳單都是要留著的
You always keep the handbill of your first bounty.

683
00:56:14,568 --> 00:56:16,364
這才叫準確
That's accurate.

684
00:57:24,212 --> 00:57:26,928
醫生，姜戈，你們好嗎？
Doctor, Django, how the hell are ya?

685
00:57:28,366 --> 00:57:30,031
你那邊又打死了誰啊？
Who the hell have you got there?

686
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,629
威爾森-洛的團伙
The Wilson-Lowe Gang.

687
00:57:33,112 --> 00:57:35,758
這夥人...他們誰啊？
Who the hell is the Wilson-Lowe Gang?

688
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:40,982
壞蛋查克·威爾森，鐵公雞鮑比·洛， 還有三個跟班
Bad Chuck Wilson and meaner Bobby Lowe, and three of their acolytes.

689
00:57:41,279 --> 00:57:42,357
啊
Huh.

690
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,052
留在外面就可以，他們也不會跑
Well just leave 'em out here, they ain't goin' nowhere.

691
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:48,955
別在雪地堹葭菑F，我給你倒點咖啡
Let's comin' outta the snowy snow and git yourself some coffee.

692
00:57:49,555 --> 00:57:52,080
昨天是我生日，吃了蛋糕！
Had a birthday yesterday, got some cake!

693
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,818
真不錯
Pretty good.

694
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
在這個寒冷又收穫頗豐的冬天之後

695
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:11,500
姜戈和舒爾茲醫生下山了， 繼續進發，朝著...

696
00:58:15,974 --> 00:58:17,589
跟著！
Move along!

697
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
密西西比州

698
00:58:23,545 --> 00:58:24,665
快，走啊！
Do it, walk!

699
00:58:27,588 --> 00:58:28,585
繼續走
Keep moving.

700
00:58:32,324 --> 00:58:35,124
不要有泥巴就走不動了，走啊
Don't let that mud slow you down, keep going.

701
00:58:50,865 --> 00:58:52,265
跟上
Keep on.

702
00:58:54,785 --> 00:58:57,956
布隆希達 范 夏夫特，27歲
Broomhilda Von Shaft, age twenty-seven,

703
00:58:58,649 --> 00:59:00,469
右臉頰有「R」…
“r” on right cheek…

704
00:59:01,803 --> 00:59:03,810
卡爾文·坎迪
Calvin Candy.

705
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:08,397
他是密西西比州第四大棉花園的主人， 叫坎迪園
He owns the fourth biggest cotton plantation in Mississippi, Candyland.

706
00:59:08,967 --> 00:59:10,367
「坎迪園」？
Candyland?

707
00:59:10,425 --> 00:59:11,533
哦你聽說過？
Oh so you've heard of it?

708
00:59:11,572 --> 00:59:13,476
沒有奴隸沒聽說過坎迪園的
Ain't no slave that ain't heard of Candyland.

709
00:59:13,742 --> 00:59:16,124
好吧，顯然你老婆現在就在那
Well, apparently that's where you wife is,

710
00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:19,473
這個討厭鬼現在是你老婆的主人
and that's the repelling gentleman who owns her.

711
00:59:19,528 --> 00:59:22,119
我們現在就希望她是在外務工的吧，在田里的
Let's just hope she works in the out, slaying in the field.

712
00:59:22,166 --> 00:59:23,820
哦不，她不會在田里的，老兄
Oh no, she ain't in the field, mate.

713
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:26,256
她…她很漂亮
She… she pretty.

714
00:59:27,234 --> 00:59:28,644
也很高挑
and she a tall girl, too.

715
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,416
那個之前你在田里打死的傢伙...
The one you tore back up on the nag…

716
00:59:33,788 --> 00:59:35,715
在她臉頰燙了一個「R」，逃跑的標誌
he burnt her runaway on her cheek.

717
00:59:37,161 --> 00:59:38,410
真是該死
They got damned.

718
00:59:43,221 --> 00:59:46,421
她不是做農活的，但也沒辦法在屋子堸筐々F
She no field nigger, but she ain't good enough for the house no more either.

719
00:59:46,734 --> 00:59:48,427
他們會讓她去做慰安婦
They're gonna try to make her comfort girl.

720
00:59:48,456 --> 00:59:50,193
慰安婦是…喔
What's a comfort- Oh.

721
00:59:50,975 --> 00:59:53,075
現在我有自由了...
Now while I got freedom…

722
00:59:53,871 --> 00:59:55,691
也有槍了
Now while I got my gun.

723
00:59:58,769 --> 01:00:00,589
我們應該出價買她嗎？
So do we offer to buy her?

724
01:00:03,189 --> 01:00:04,309
所以…
So…

725
01:00:06,187 --> 01:00:07,307
假如啊…
say…

726
01:00:09,898 --> 01:00:12,536
一個人想買一匹馬…
a man wants to buy a horse…

727
01:00:13,177 --> 01:00:14,997
需要買這匹馬
needs to buy a horse.

728
01:00:16,712 --> 01:00:19,553
他就去了這個農夫的農場，敲了他的門
He walks up to the farmer's farm, he knocks on the farmer's door,

729
01:00:19,569 --> 01:00:23,005
跟農夫買這匹馬。 然後你也知道這個農夫會說什麼，
and asks the farmer to buy his horse. And you know what the farmer says,

730
01:00:23,248 --> 01:00:25,364
農夫說，「不賣。」
the farmer says: “No”.

731
01:00:27,011 --> 01:00:29,317
那我說：去你媽的農夫
Well I say: fuck that farmer.

732
01:00:29,845 --> 01:00:31,383
我要把馬偷走
And I'm stealin' that horse.

733
01:00:32,118 --> 01:00:36,318
也行，但你就成了偷馬賊了 偷馬賊可是要被吊死的
Fair enough, but now you are horse thief, and they hang horse thieves.

734
01:00:36,483 --> 01:00:38,840
且不提馬要被送回給主人了
Not to mention the horse goes back to its original owner,

735
01:00:38,862 --> 01:00:40,691
因為無論如何馬都還是他的
 because the horse is still its property.

736
01:00:40,734 --> 01:00:44,359
我們需要她，還需要買賣收據
We need her and we need a bill of sale.

737
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:47,154
那如果我們不去開口買， 那要怎麼才能找回她？
But if we ain't gonna try to buy, then how we gonna get it?

738
01:00:48,038 --> 01:00:51,879
我能不能提個建議，替補方案？
May I offer an alternative plan for action?

739
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:53,390
說吧
Go ahead.

740
01:00:55,301 --> 01:00:59,806
這個人他去了農場，敲了門
The man walks up to the farmer's farm, he knocks on the farmer's door,

741
01:01:00,408 --> 01:01:05,913
他不是說要買馬，而是說要買農場
and asks not to buy the horse, but the farm,

742
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:12,027
並且提出了天價的交易，這個農夫不得不答應
and makes an offer so ridiculous, the farmer's forced to say yes.

743
01:01:12,761 --> 01:01:14,448
我們要買坎迪園啊？
We're gonna offer to buy Candyland?

744
01:01:14,479 --> 01:01:19,079
不，那太大了，但很顯然， 農夫不僅僅只有農場吧
No, it's far too big, but apparently, this farmer ain't all about the farm.

745
01:01:20,626 --> 01:01:22,741
你知不知道曼丁戈？（指斗奴隸）
How much do you know about mandingo fighting?

746
01:01:22,781 --> 01:01:23,687
什麼？
What?

747
01:01:23,851 --> 01:01:28,637
你能不能化妝成一個這樣的交易高手？
Can you convincingly masquerade of someone who's an expert on mandingo fighting?

748
01:01:28,708 --> 01:01:29,828
幹嘛？
Why?

749
01:01:30,096 --> 01:01:33,914
因為我要扮演一個 杜塞爾多夫來的大買家
Because my character is that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf,

750
01:01:33,914 --> 01:01:37,294
來格林威爾想要砸錢進入這個曼丁戈圈子
here in Greenville to buy my way into the mandingo fight game,

751
01:01:37,342 --> 01:01:41,230
你扮演的呢就是我聘來的曼丁戈高手 幫我完成這個任務的
and your character is the mandingo expert I hired to help me do it.

752
01:01:41,363 --> 01:01:43,079
他們叫那「獨眼龍查理」
They call that “One-Eyed Charly”.

753
01:01:46,471 --> 01:01:47,851
你們好
Bonjour.

754
01:01:48,012 --> 01:01:51,111
你好，黑珍珠（法語）
Bonsoir, p'tite femme noire,

755
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:53,712
我們是來見卡爾文·坎迪先生的
we are here to see Mr. Calvin Candy.

756
01:01:54,025 --> 01:01:55,585
進來
Enter.

757
01:01:58,242 --> 01:01:59,642
謝謝
Thank you.

758
01:02:00,495 --> 01:02:02,638
你要我演個黑人的黑奴買家？
You want me to play a black slaver?

759
01:02:03,474 --> 01:02:05,737
沒有比黑人的黑奴買家更差勁的人了吧
Ain't nothin lower than a black slaver.

760
01:02:06,362 --> 01:02:09,242
黑人的黑奴買家比管家的黑奴還差啊
A black slaver is lower than a head house nigger.

761
01:02:10,414 --> 01:02:12,220
老兄，那可真是有點差
And buddy, that's pretty fuckin' low.

762
01:02:13,799 --> 01:02:15,768
那就照著那個演
Then play him that way,

763
01:02:15,823 --> 01:02:19,784
演出個黑奴買家的樣子來
give me your black slaver.

764
01:02:31,416 --> 01:02:33,116
舒爾茲醫生！
Dr. Schultz!

765
01:02:33,163 --> 01:02:34,788
能再見面真高興啊
Good to see you again.

766
01:02:34,929 --> 01:02:36,329
摩吉先生
Mr. Moguy.

767
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:40,322
謝謝你幫忙安排這次見面
Thank you for your assistance in creating the opportunity for this appointment.

768
01:02:40,338 --> 01:02:41,898
別，這是我的工作嘛
Nonsense, it's my job.

769
01:02:42,554 --> 01:02:45,674
所以這就是大名鼎鼎的獨眼龍查理啊
So, this is the One-Eyed Charly I've heard so much about.

770
01:02:45,815 --> 01:02:47,705
這是自由人姜戈
Yes, this is Django Freeman.

771
01:02:48,049 --> 01:02:50,797
姜戈，這是坎迪先生的律師， 萊奧尼·摩吉
Django, this is Mr. Candie's lawyer, Leonide Moguy.

772
01:02:50,930 --> 01:02:52,607
叫我萊奧
Just call me Leo.

773
01:02:52,943 --> 01:02:56,290
卡爾文在朱麗葉斯·凱撒廳，跟我來吧？
Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room, y'all wanna follow me?

774
01:02:56,527 --> 01:02:58,831
你跟坎迪先生共事多久了？
How long have you been associated with Mr. Candie?

775
01:02:58,917 --> 01:03:03,126
我和卡爾文的父親一起上寄宿學校的時候， 我們才大概11歲
Oh, Calvin's father and I were about eleven when we went to boarding school together.

776
01:03:03,639 --> 01:03:06,434
卡爾文的祖父讓我上的法學院
Calvins' father father put me through law school.

777
01:03:06,594 --> 01:03:09,669
所以可以這麼說，我生來就是給卡爾文當律師的
One could almost say, I was raised to be Calvin's lawyer.

778
01:03:09,766 --> 01:03:12,060
那就是說你跟黑奴沒什麼兩樣嘛
One could almost say, you's a nigger.

779
01:03:12,429 --> 01:03:13,989
你說什麼？
What did you say?

780
01:03:14,216 --> 01:03:15,218
我說…
I say…

781
01:03:15,243 --> 01:03:17,343
沒什麼沒什麼，他說話就這樣
Real nothing, he's just being cheeky.

782
01:03:17,478 --> 01:03:21,923
見坎迪先生之前，我還有什麼需要知道的嗎？
Now, anything else about Mr. Candie that I should know before I meet him?

783
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:24,108
他比較親法
Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.

784
01:03:24,198 --> 01:03:26,008
哪個文明人不是呢？
Ah, what civilized people aren't?

785
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:28,477
他喜歡別人叫他法語的「先生」而不是英語的
And he prefers Monsieur Candie to Mister Candie.

786
01:03:28,516 --> 01:03:30,616
那就隨著他來好了（法語）
Hmm, si c'est cela qu'il prefere.

787
01:03:30,779 --> 01:03:35,029
他不說法語的，不要跟他說法語， 那會讓他難堪
He doesn't speak French. Don't speak French to him, it'll embarrass him.

788
01:03:38,244 --> 01:03:40,569
翻到上面啊，轉過來
Get back on top now, turn around.

789
01:03:40,632 --> 01:03:41,700
這就對了
There you go.

790
01:03:42,198 --> 01:03:43,616
這就對了
There you go.

791
01:03:45,598 --> 01:03:48,283
你是為什麼要加入曼丁戈這行？
Why do you want to get in the mandingo business?

792
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:55,146
不準備讓你的手下來個正式的介紹嗎？
You don't intend to allow your second to make the proper introductions?

793
01:03:55,443 --> 01:03:58,854
別拖拖拉拉的，回答問題
Quit stalling now. Answer the question.

794
01:04:01,294 --> 01:04:02,940
真話很難聽哦？
The awful truth?

795
01:04:03,197 --> 01:04:04,862
我就是無聊了嘛
Pff, I'm bored.

796
01:04:04,972 --> 01:04:06,812
這個看上去挺好玩的
This seems like a good bit of fun.

797
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:14,250
那過來吧
Well, come on over.

798
01:04:14,486 --> 01:04:17,132
這堨縞斯菮O，確實挺好玩的
We got us a fight goin' on, that's a good bit of fun.

799
01:04:21,031 --> 01:04:23,131
跟我一起去吧檯吧
Won't you accompany me to the bar?

800
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:34,218
在這房子堣ㄔi以亂闖，甚至連我都知道的
You don't go ahead in a house, white man, even I know that.

801
01:04:43,368 --> 01:04:45,068
- 舒爾茲醫生... - 我真是高興...
Dr. Schultz… – What a real pleasure-

802
01:04:45,076 --> 01:04:46,689
繼續打啊黑鬼們!
Keep fighting, niggers!

803
01:04:46,775 --> 01:04:48,306
我必須說，這是個榮幸
.. and I might add, an honor.

804
01:04:48,642 --> 01:04:51,889
很榮幸見到你，請坐請坐， 這是我的榮幸
Honored to meet you, please have a seat, the pleasure's all mine.

805
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,651
給自由人姜戈倒酒，他要什麼都行
Get Freeman Django here whatever he wants.

806
01:04:55,379 --> 01:04:57,199
我要甜杜松子波本
And I'll have sweet gin bourbon.

807
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:19,598
加把勁，照我說的打！
You go way, boy, you do what I tell you!

808
01:05:20,861 --> 01:05:22,468
他真是強壯威猛！
He's got big and strong!

809
01:05:23,124 --> 01:05:24,524
來啊！
Com'on now!

810
01:05:24,684 --> 01:05:27,484
啊，他沒照著我說的打，老天啊
Ah, he's not doing what I told him. For God sake.

811
01:05:28,134 --> 01:05:31,327
打得好，路易奇，動作再快點（意大利語）
Bravo, Luigi, cosi e dai. De casse piu rapido.

812
01:05:31,432 --> 01:05:34,289
加把力啊，這是搏命好嗎！
Com'on now boys, this a fight to the death!

813
01:05:35,344 --> 01:05:37,271
打那頭野獸，不然你就死了！
Hit that animal or you're ain't!

814
01:05:42,042 --> 01:05:45,226
在地毯上打，回到地毯上面
Ecco i con la spola tappeto. La spola tappeto giu.

815
01:05:45,757 --> 01:05:47,577
大弗雷德，加把力！
Big Fred, com'on!

816
01:05:48,492 --> 01:05:50,091
現在把他翻過來吧！
Turn him around, now!

817
01:05:53,647 --> 01:05:55,660
使點力啊！
Use your strength, boy!

818
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,259
加把力啊，用力打！
Com'on now, use your strength!

819
01:06:00,446 --> 01:06:01,846
這就對了！
There you go!

820
01:06:03,217 --> 01:06:04,617
這就對了！
There you go!

821
01:06:05,014 --> 01:06:05,808
看看這個！
Look at that!

822
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:09,829
我告訴過你了，這人是野獸啊
Yeah I told you, this is a wild man.

823
01:06:10,245 --> 01:06:12,065
照我說的打
Do what I told you, boy.

824
01:06:12,449 --> 01:06:13,282
這就對了！
Here you go!

825
01:06:13,328 --> 01:06:15,306
啊，不！
Ah. No! Aah!

826
01:06:15,361 --> 01:06:18,210
照我說的打，把他壓在地上
Do what I told you. Ground him back, boy.

827
01:06:18,233 --> 01:06:19,475
打後背！
Ground him back!

828
01:06:21,757 --> 01:06:23,715
啊，不要輸！
Uh, you no lose!

829
01:06:31,351 --> 01:06:33,226
不！不！
No! No!

830
01:06:44,526 --> 01:06:45,683
終結他吧
Finish him.

831
01:06:49,642 --> 01:06:51,462
上啊，終結他！
Go on, boy, finish him!

832
01:06:55,841 --> 01:06:57,519
這就是為什麼他們叫我大弗雷德！
That's why they call him big Fred!

833
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:59,261
貨真價實
Worth every penny.

834
01:06:59,301 --> 01:07:01,050
永別了路易奇
Well, arrivederchi, Luigi!

835
01:07:01,269 --> 01:07:03,605
起來吧孩子，休息一下
Com'on up now boy, get yourself a rest,

836
01:07:03,613 --> 01:07:06,469
你打得漂亮，真的
you did a fine job, a real fine job.

837
01:07:07,111 --> 01:07:08,231
可以過來了
Proceed in.

838
01:07:29,826 --> 01:07:31,226
龍舌蘭
Tequila.

839
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:42,437
你叫什麼？
What's your name?

840
01:07:44,923 --> 01:07:46,208
姜戈
Django.

841
01:07:48,757 --> 01:07:50,577
能拼一下嗎？
Can you spell it?

842
01:07:52,523 --> 01:07:56,513
D, J, A, N, G, O.
D, J, A, N, G, O.

843
01:07:58,201 --> 01:08:00,021
D不發音
The D is silent.

844
01:08:00,157 --> 01:08:01,277
我知道
I know.

845
01:08:08,479 --> 01:08:09,393
我們走了
Umberto, andiamo.

846
01:08:09,456 --> 01:08:10,576
摩吉先生
Mr. Moguy,

847
01:08:11,042 --> 01:08:12,784
我需要你幫我好好照顧這位新人
I want you to take care o' my new boy here.

848
01:08:13,034 --> 01:08:14,930
給他找個房間，一張舒服的床
You find him a room with a soft bed,

849
01:08:14,939 --> 01:08:17,272
找一頭小馬駒，幫他舔傷口
and you bring him up a pony to lick his pawl.

850
01:08:17,781 --> 01:08:20,591
準備好明天早上去坎迪園，知道了嗎？
You be ready to travel to Candyland tomorrow mornin' now, you hear?

851
01:08:20,669 --> 01:08:21,489
遵命
Yessir, Mr. Candy.

852
01:08:21,529 --> 01:08:25,347
啊，走之前，羅斯科， 給弗雷德來一大杯啤酒
Oh before you go, Roscoe, get Fred here a tall beer.

853
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:30,978
好好享受吧
You enjoy that, boy.

854
01:08:31,479 --> 01:08:32,603
你自己贏來的
You've earned it.

855
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:33,810
是
Yessir.

856
01:08:43,332 --> 01:08:44,782
你的名字叫什麼？
What's your name, boy?

857
01:08:44,916 --> 01:08:47,016
他是姜戈，自由人
His name is Django Freeman.

858
01:08:47,409 --> 01:08:48,529
嗯
Hm-hm.

859
01:08:51,018 --> 01:08:52,242
你從哪塈鋮鴘漸L？
Where did ya dig him up?

860
01:08:52,269 --> 01:08:56,008
很多偶然的事件讓我認識了姜戈
A fortuitous turn of events brought Django and myself together.

861
01:08:57,508 --> 01:08:59,469
我有聽過你的傳言
I've heard tell about you.

862
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:03,176
我聽說你告訴每個人說 曼丁戈沒什麼好的
I heard you've been telling ev'rybody that mandingos are not damn good,

863
01:09:03,182 --> 01:09:06,543
說賣的都是不值錢的，我挺好奇啊
ain't nothing nobody is selling is worth buying, I'm curious.

864
01:09:07,295 --> 01:09:09,394
你是怎麼成為曼丁戈專家的？
What makes you such a mandingo expert?

865
01:09:11,638 --> 01:09:14,038
我好奇的是你有什麼好奇的？
I'm curious what makes you so curious?

866
01:09:17,483 --> 01:09:19,285
- 你剛才說什麼？ - 冷靜點布奇
– What did you say, boy? – Calm down Butch.

867
01:09:20,643 --> 01:09:22,121
對方沒有惡意...
No offense given…

868
01:09:22,653 --> 01:09:23,736
那我當然沒感到什麼惡意了
None taken.

869
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:25,330
坎迪先生...
Uh, Monsieur Candie…

870
01:09:25,689 --> 01:09:29,554
請向我說明你的疑問吧，不勝感激
Uhm, I'd appreciate if you could direct your line of inquiry toward me.

871
01:09:29,609 --> 01:09:30,729
一
One.

872
01:09:31,684 --> 01:09:34,775
你什麼喝的都沒有點，我給你弄點好喝的吧
You do not have anything to drink, can I get you a tasty refreshment.

873
01:09:34,915 --> 01:09:36,744
當然！我要啤酒
Yes! I'll have a beer.

874
01:09:36,838 --> 01:09:37,931
好極了
Wunderbar.

875
01:09:38,117 --> 01:09:40,036
羅斯科，給這個大鬍子來杯啤酒
Roscoe, a beer for the man with the beard,

876
01:09:40,046 --> 01:09:43,442
我要波利尼西亞珍珠雞尾酒， 不要把朗姆酒灑了
and I will have a Polynesian Pearl Diver, do no spill the rum.

877
01:09:44,028 --> 01:09:45,148
醫生...
Doc…

878
01:09:46,359 --> 01:09:49,872
我是個老練的奴隸主，你是... 你是個新手吧
I'm a seasoned slaver, you are- well, you are a neophyte,

879
01:09:49,888 --> 01:09:54,730
我只是在試探這個牛仔 有沒有在佔你的便宜
I'm simply trying to ascertain if this cowboy here is taking advantage of you.

880
01:09:56,410 --> 01:09:59,329
我十分敬重您，坎迪先生
With all due respect, Monsieur Candie,

881
01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:02,223
我並不是找你要建議的
I didn't seek you out for your advice.

882
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:06,846
我是找你用超過市場價的錢買黑奴的
I sought you out to purchase a fighting nigger at above top dollar market price.

883
01:10:07,291 --> 01:10:10,171
我注意到身邊還有一大群觀眾啊
I was under the impression when you granted me an audience,

884
01:10:10,191 --> 01:10:12,532
我們是要談生意的吧
it would be to discuss business.

885
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:17,210
但我們還沒開始談生意吧
But we weren't talking business yet.

886
01:10:17,882 --> 01:10:19,756
剛才只是在談談我的好奇心
We were discussing my curiosity.

887
01:10:23,458 --> 01:10:26,158
羅斯科，可可，出去玩吧
Roscoe, Coco, go outside and play.

888
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:29,427
西芭
Sheba,

889
01:10:29,784 --> 01:10:31,604
你留下
you stay right there.

890
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:34,078
我知道你沒喊我
I know you didn't name me.

891
01:10:35,334 --> 01:10:36,454
乾杯
Prost.

892
01:10:36,703 --> 01:10:37,823
乾杯
Jambo.

893
01:10:38,688 --> 01:10:40,170
據摩吉說
Now according to Moguy,

894
01:10:40,572 --> 01:10:44,881
如果我跟你做生意， 就等於是跟你們倆做生意
if I do business with you, I'm doin' business with both of y'all.

895
01:10:44,995 --> 01:10:47,469
他負責觀察，你負責掏錢，是吧？
He does the eyeballin', you the billfold, is that it?

896
01:10:47,587 --> 01:10:52,030
你說話還挺直白啊，不過大概就是這樣
Well, you don't make it sound too flattering, but more or less, yeah.

897
01:10:53,788 --> 01:10:54,908
所以...
So…

898
01:10:55,457 --> 01:10:56,857
聰明人
Bright Boy,

899
01:10:57,077 --> 01:10:59,385
摩吉說你見過我的黑人們了
Moguy tells me you looked over my African flesh,

900
01:10:59,386 --> 01:11:01,301
你沒有什麼特別感興趣的啊？
and you was none too impressed, huh?

901
01:11:01,505 --> 01:11:03,305
值得花大價錢的沒有
Not for top dollar.

902
01:11:05,399 --> 01:11:07,248
那我們就沒有什麼好談的了
Well then we got nothing more to talk about.

903
01:11:07,457 --> 01:11:09,525
你看，你想要從我這買個能打的
You see, you wanna buy a beat ass nigger from me,

904
01:11:09,607 --> 01:11:12,081
那些都是我在賣的能打的了
those was all the beat ass niggers I wanna sell, so…

905
01:11:12,142 --> 01:11:14,616
他不想買你在賣的
He don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna sell.

906
01:11:15,073 --> 01:11:17,944
他要買你不想賣的
He wants the nigger you don't wanna sell.

907
01:11:18,501 --> 01:11:22,522
我不想賣的我不賣
I don't sell the niggers I don't wanna sell.

908
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:28,420
你肯定不會賣你最好的
Well, hm. You won't sell your best.

909
01:11:28,657 --> 01:11:30,579
第二好的也不會賣
You won't even sell your second best.

910
01:11:31,392 --> 01:11:34,655
但是你第三好的... 估計你也不會賣
But your third best you don't want to sell him either…

911
01:11:35,069 --> 01:11:38,926
但是如果我出個天價， 你肯定會考慮考慮的
but if I made you an offer so ridiculous you'd be forced to consider it…

912
01:11:40,513 --> 01:11:42,793
誰知道你會怎麼想呢
who knows what could happen?

913
01:11:44,286 --> 01:11:46,686
你定義的「天價」是多少？
And what do you consider ridiculous?

914
01:11:47,398 --> 01:11:51,981
對於一個真正有天賦的，「對的人」？
For a truly talented specimen, well “The Right Nigger”?

915
01:11:53,516 --> 01:11:55,318
你覺得多少錢合適，姜戈？
How much would you say, Django?

916
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:00,500
一萬二
Twelve thousand dollars.

917
01:12:05,445 --> 01:12:06,606
先生們
Gentlemen…

918
01:12:07,008 --> 01:12:08,772
剛才我還是好奇
You had my curiosity.

919
01:12:09,217 --> 01:12:10,902
現在我興趣很大啊
Now you have my attention.

920
01:12:25,062 --> 01:12:27,140
威利...威利
Willie… Willie.

921
01:12:27,187 --> 01:12:29,007
停一停，停一停
Hold up! Hold up.

922
01:12:29,521 --> 01:12:30,331
啊
Aah.

923
01:12:30,401 --> 01:12:32,057
先生們早上好
Good morning, gentlemen.

924
01:12:32,144 --> 01:12:35,204
舒爾茲醫生好，多美的早晨啊
Good Dr. Schultz. Beautiful morning isn't it?

925
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:37,298
找不到比這更好的了
You couldn't have picked a better one.

926
01:12:37,345 --> 01:12:40,360
請跟我們一起坐一坐馬車吧
Please, won't you take a ride with us here in the Victorian.

927
01:12:40,392 --> 01:12:42,068
噢非常感謝
Oh, thank you very much.

928
01:12:42,116 --> 01:12:44,270
把你的馬綁在後面
Tie your horse up back there.

929
01:12:52,344 --> 01:12:53,464
姜戈！
Django!

930
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,825
我跟身邊的大多數人還是要保持距離的
Well I part company from many of my phenologist colleagues,

931
01:13:02,166 --> 01:13:05,124
因為我覺得會有人 是比聰明還要更聰明
cause I believe there's a level above bright,

932
01:13:05,665 --> 01:13:11,155
比有天賦、忠誠還要更有天賦和忠誠 普通黑人是做不到的
above talented, above loyal that a nigger can aspire.

933
01:13:11,753 --> 01:13:16,664
我會說這樣一個黑人只能是萬里挑一的
Say one nigger that just pops up on ten thousand.

934
01:13:16,711 --> 01:13:18,531
一個特別優秀的黑人
The exceptional nigger.

935
01:13:19,412 --> 01:13:21,261
天氣不錯吧
Bright day uh, Bright Boy?

936
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,798
太陽升起來了
Sun is up.

937
01:13:24,754 --> 01:13:26,574
照在每個人身上
Shinin' on all of us.

938
01:13:31,457 --> 01:13:33,277
請坐吧，醫生
Have a seat, Doc.

939
01:13:34,759 --> 01:13:35,943
十分榮幸
Great an honor.

940
01:13:36,054 --> 01:13:37,388
是我們的榮幸
The honor is all ours.

941
01:13:37,506 --> 01:13:38,091
謝謝
Thank you.

942
01:13:38,123 --> 01:13:44,433
但我相信，只要有時間， 特別優秀的黑人，比如現在這位聰明人
.. but I do believe that given time, exceptional niggers like Bright Boy here,

943
01:13:45,348 --> 01:13:47,470
總會出現的，只要沒有自由…
will come if not freedom…

944
01:13:48,245 --> 01:13:49,645
更多的自由…
more freedom…

945
01:13:51,611 --> 01:13:53,011
聰明人
Bright Boy,

946
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:55,962
你就是那萬分之一
you are that one in ten thousand.

947
01:13:56,391 --> 01:13:59,334
現在玩的是跟上，不是追上，黑鬼
The name of the game is keep up, not catch up, nigger.

948
01:14:15,288 --> 01:14:16,512
敢碰槍你們就死定了
Touch your guns, you're dead.

949
01:14:16,521 --> 01:14:18,341
大家冷靜！
Everybody calm down!

950
01:14:19,036 --> 01:14:20,940
我都看到了，不要衝動
I saw the whole thing, no harm done.

951
01:14:20,971 --> 01:14:22,633
開玩笑呢吧，這個黑鬼...
Are you- are you kiddin' me, this nigger-

952
01:14:22,664 --> 01:14:26,164
我說了不要動手！ 把手從槍上拿開！
I said no harm done! Now take your hands off your pistol!

953
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:28,916
布奇！
Butch!

954
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:31,070
你也一樣
That means you too.

955
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,653
所有人都不許挑釁我的客人
Ev'rybody stop antagonizing my guests.

956
01:14:36,355 --> 01:14:37,230
胡！
Who!

957
01:14:37,497 --> 01:14:39,119
騎回你馬上去
Git back upon your horse.

958
01:14:39,436 --> 01:14:40,871
他把我鎖骨打斷了！
He broke my collarbone!

959
01:14:40,965 --> 01:14:45,572
上帝啊，誰來幫他一下爬到馬上去
For God sake, somebody please help Who here back upon his goddamn horse.

960
01:14:46,368 --> 01:14:48,631
哇，你真是個幸運的黑鬼
Ooh, now you are one lucky nigger.

961
01:14:49,858 --> 01:14:51,683
聽你頭兒的話吧，小鬼
You got to listen to your boss, white boy.

962
01:14:51,770 --> 01:14:54,127
噢，全心全意為您服務啊
Oh I'm a good walk in any moonlight for you.

963
01:14:54,325 --> 01:14:56,145
想捧著我的手嗎？
You wanna hold my hand?

964
01:15:02,262 --> 01:15:05,215
威利！我們回家吧
Willie! Take us home.

965
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:04,549
你眼睛是有問題嗎？
You got a problem with your eyeball, boy?

966
01:16:04,654 --> 01:16:05,668
沒有
No sir.

967
01:16:05,734 --> 01:16:08,134
想我把鞋跟踩進去是吧？
You wan' a boot heel in it?

968
01:16:08,626 --> 01:16:09,504
不想
No sir.

969
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:11,922
那就別盯著看
Then keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.

970
01:16:13,089 --> 01:16:16,125
再讓我看到這張臭臉，我會讓我更恨我的
Flash that bad look at me again, I give you a reason not to like me.

971
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:17,360
跟上，黑鬼！
Now move, nigger!

972
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:21,925
你的黑鬼們得看看清楚我是誰
You niggers gonna understand somethin' 'bout me.

973
01:16:22,074 --> 01:16:23,938
我比這堨籉韝@個白人都值錢
I'm worse than any o'these white men here.

974
01:16:24,235 --> 01:16:27,571
讓他們不要亂看，尤其不要看我
You keep them eyelash inside your ass, you keep them goddamn eyeballs off me.

975
01:16:27,853 --> 01:16:31,053
他還挺粗暴啊是吧
He is a rambunctious sort, ain't it?

976
01:16:31,109 --> 01:16:32,405
確實！
Indeed!

977
01:16:34,959 --> 01:16:38,152
能停一下嗎，我跟他有句話說
May you stop for a moment, so I may put put a word in my man's ear?

978
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:42,249
我準備要徹底愛上坎迪園的戰士們
Yeah, I'm expecting to fall in love once I see the specimen of Candyland,

979
01:16:42,289 --> 01:16:45,662
所以在那之前，我還是想要
so before that moment, it would be good if I could have

980
01:16:45,663 --> 01:16:49,723
跟我的謀士來個保密戰略會談
a confidential strategy meeting with my… confident.

981
01:16:53,113 --> 01:16:54,829
能不能說說你到底在幹嘛？
You mind tellin' me what the hell you doing?

982
01:16:54,903 --> 01:16:57,439
我已經確認布隆希達就在坎迪園
I've confirmed that Broomhilda's at Candyland.

983
01:17:00,988 --> 01:17:02,431
你確定是她？
Are you sure it's her?

984
01:17:02,523 --> 01:17:04,872
他沒有說她的名字，但確定是位年輕女子
He didn't call her by name, but she's a young lady,

985
01:17:04,897 --> 01:17:06,848
背上有鞭痕，說德語
whip marks on her back, and speaks German.

986
01:17:07,223 --> 01:17:09,362
現在還不好假設什麼
Now while it's not wise to assume,

987
01:17:09,363 --> 01:17:11,791
但這種情況下我看已經很肯定了吧
in this instance, I think it's pretty safe.

988
01:17:11,901 --> 01:17:13,301
關鍵是...
Point being…

989
01:17:13,656 --> 01:17:16,476
不要報仇報得太囂張了
don't get so carried away with your retribution.

990
01:17:16,789 --> 01:17:18,758
都忘了是來這幹嘛的了吧
We lose sight on why we're here.

991
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:20,081
你覺得我忘了？
You think I lost sight, did I?

992
01:17:20,112 --> 01:17:23,070
是啊！不要再挑釁坎迪了！
Yes, I do! Stop antagonizing Candy!

993
01:17:23,462 --> 01:17:28,639
你要把他手下人都惹毛了， 我們倆就都玩完了
You're going to blow this whole charade, or more than likely get both of us killed,

994
01:17:28,663 --> 01:17:33,410
至少我是不願意死在這 美國密西西比的芝卡索縣
and I, for one, don't intend to die in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, U.S.A.

995
01:17:33,652 --> 01:17:36,384
我沒有挑釁，我這是使點伎倆
I'm not antagonizing. I'm intriguing him.

996
01:17:36,673 --> 01:17:39,405
你在大聲羞辱這些可憐的奴隸啊
You- you're yelling abuse of these poor slaves!

997
01:17:40,186 --> 01:17:42,006
我想起某個...
I recall the man….

998
01:17:42,444 --> 01:17:45,762
讓我當著別人兒子的面殺人的傢伙了 （指之前史密蒂）
who had me killed another man in front o' his son,

999
01:17:45,848 --> 01:17:47,205
他眼皮都不眨啊
and he didn't bat an eye.

1000
01:17:49,056 --> 01:17:50,456
還記得嗎？
Remember that?

1001
01:17:52,377 --> 01:17:53,663
我當然記得！
Yeah of course I remember!

1002
01:17:53,765 --> 01:17:55,273
你說的是...
What you said was…

1003
01:17:55,539 --> 01:17:56,827
你說的，這不是我的話...
You said, this ain't my word…

1004
01:17:58,355 --> 01:18:00,094
「要我說，你就得染得一身骯髒」
“In my word you got to get dirty”.

1005
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:04,071
我正在這麼做，弄得骯髒點
So that's what I'm doing. I'm getting dirty.

1006
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:11,013
你解釋得是不錯，但是...
Well you're paraphrasing a tad, but…

1007
01:18:12,534 --> 01:18:14,409
這一般是...
that was it generally, just…

1008
01:18:18,423 --> 01:18:20,243
坎迪園見吧
see you at Candyland.

1009
01:18:27,189 --> 01:18:28,704
好了黑鬼們！
Alright niggers!

1010
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:30,199
做正事了
Back at it.

1011
01:18:31,376 --> 01:18:33,476
你也一樣，白鬼
That means you too, moonlight.

1012
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:23,262
達達尼昂！
I'll 'be. D'Artagnan!

1013
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:26,954
天，你怎麼會幹逃跑這麼蠢的事？
Now well, why do a fool thing like run off?

1014
01:19:27,421 --> 01:19:29,595
我不能再打架了，坎迪先生
I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candy.

1015
01:19:29,847 --> 01:19:31,247
你當然能！
Yes you can!

1016
01:19:31,448 --> 01:19:33,633
你或許不能贏，但肯定還能打啊
Y?u m?ght n?t b? ?bl? t? w?n, but y?ur ??? ??n f?ght.

1017
01:19:34,704 --> 01:19:37,279
斯通瑟，你能不能讓這些狗閉嘴
Mr. Stonesipher, would you please shut these goddamn dogs up,

1018
01:19:37,317 --> 01:19:38,588
我都聽不到自己的思考了！
I cannot hear myself think!

1019
01:19:38,619 --> 01:19:43,405
噓，瑪莎！噓！安靜！
Hush now, Marsha! Hush up, Marsha! Marsha, hush up!

1020
01:19:43,555 --> 01:19:46,897
讓這些狗不要煩這黑鬼了！
Hey, get these goddamn dogs away from this nigger!

1021
01:19:56,075 --> 01:19:57,895
好了孩子
Well now boy…

1022
01:19:58,526 --> 01:20:00,742
- 從樹上下來吧 - 是
Gidown o' that tree. – Yes sir.

1023
01:20:23,869 --> 01:20:25,251
他逃了有多久了？
How long was he lose?

1024
01:20:26,275 --> 01:20:27,163
一整晚...
A night…

1025
01:20:27,851 --> 01:20:28,971
一整天...
day…

1026
01:20:29,775 --> 01:20:30,895
頭天還有半個晚上
Half the other night.

1027
01:20:32,388 --> 01:20:33,999
逃了有多遠？
How far he git off property?

1028
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:35,880
大概二十英里
Bout twenty miles off prop.

1029
01:20:36,343 --> 01:20:38,638
已經挺遠了，他的腳還跛著
Pretty fer, conside'ing that limp he got.

1030
01:20:40,989 --> 01:20:44,236
摩吉先生，達達尼昂週五要跟誰打？
Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan supposed to fight on Friday?

1031
01:20:44,424 --> 01:20:45,783
一個新人吧
One of this new lot.

1032
01:20:47,445 --> 01:20:50,231
看他現在的樣子，找個印第安瞎子 都可以把他打得落花流水
The way he looks now, a blind Indian wouldn't bet a bead on 'em.

1033
01:20:50,294 --> 01:20:53,143
求你了坎迪先生，我不能， 不能再繼續打了，我不能...
Please Mr. Candy, I ain't got it, ain't it no more, I can't-

1034
01:20:53,143 --> 01:20:56,164
不不不，不要求我...
No no no no, now no beggin'…

1035
01:20:57,367 --> 01:20:59,117
不要玩弄我柔軟的內心啊
No playin' on my soft heart.

1036
01:21:03,169 --> 01:21:04,879
你現在的確有麻煩了，孩子
You're in trouble, now son.

1037
01:21:09,206 --> 01:21:12,006
我為你花了500塊
I done paid 500 dollars for you…

1038
01:21:12,415 --> 01:21:14,688
我花了500塊呢...
When I pay 500 dollars…

1039
01:21:15,009 --> 01:21:19,389
我想要看到你給我打五次， 把別人打翻，打死
I expect to get five fights outta a nigga 'fore he rollover and play dead.

1040
01:21:19,905 --> 01:21:22,949
你得明白...我是個生意人
Got to understand, I'm… I'm running a business here!

1041
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,434
你，你只打了三次
You- you fought three fights.

1042
01:21:25,536 --> 01:21:26,830
可是三次都贏了！
But I won everyone!

1043
01:21:26,878 --> 01:21:28,469
的確，的確，
Yes you did. Yes you did,

1044
01:21:28,485 --> 01:21:31,424
但最後一次，輸和贏說不清， 算是矇混過關了
but that last one, you muddled the line between winning and losing.

1045
01:21:35,178 --> 01:21:36,998
事情還是這樣
Still the fact remain.

1046
01:21:37,538 --> 01:21:40,745
我花了五百塊，是要你們給我打五場！
I pay 500 dollars, I want five goddamn fights!

1047
01:21:41,592 --> 01:21:43,434
我的五百塊要怎麼辦啊，啊？
So what 'bout my five hundred dollars, huh?

1048
01:21:45,789 --> 01:21:47,333
我的五百塊要怎麼辦？
What about my five hundred dollars?

1049
01:21:49,161 --> 01:21:50,722
你來給我補償啊？
You go n' reimburse me?!

1050
01:21:56,859 --> 01:21:59,813
你是不是都不知道補償是什麼意思？
You even know what reimburse means?

1051
01:22:07,529 --> 01:22:09,349
我會補償你！
I'll reimburse you!

1052
01:22:13,018 --> 01:22:14,418
是嗎？
You will?

1053
01:22:19,859 --> 01:22:21,544
你要付五百塊…
You pay 500 dollars…

1054
01:22:22,756 --> 01:22:26,160
來給這個掃帚都拿不動的傢伙？
for pratic'lly a one eyed Ole'Joe ain't fit to push a broom?

1055
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:27,716
他不會的
No, he won't.

1056
01:22:29,723 --> 01:22:31,728
他只是看不下去你調戲那個人了
He's just tired of you toyin' with him, is all.

1057
01:22:32,846 --> 01:22:34,306
其實我也看不下去了
Matter o' facts, so am I.

1058
01:22:35,276 --> 01:22:37,172
我們可不會給那小鬼花一分錢
But we ain't payin' a penny for that pickaninny,

1059
01:22:37,482 --> 01:22:39,568
他們又沒有用，是吧，醫生？
ain't got no use for 'em, ain't that right, Doc?

1060
01:22:40,997 --> 01:22:42,123
你也聽到了！
You heard 'em!

1061
01:22:51,607 --> 01:22:56,159
你得原諒斯通瑟現在這樣盯著你看
I'm gonna have to excuse Mr. Stonesipher slack jaw gaze, he…

1062
01:22:56,373 --> 01:22:58,902
他這輩子都沒見過像你這樣的黑人
he ain't never seen a nigger like you ever in his life.

1063
01:22:59,768 --> 01:23:01,548
是吧，斯通瑟？
Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?

1064
01:23:04,041 --> 01:23:05,441
是啊
That right.

1065
01:23:06,392 --> 01:23:07,512
既然這樣
That matter…

1066
01:23:09,257 --> 01:23:11,077
那就算了
Won't have that.

1067
01:23:16,645 --> 01:23:17,765
現在
Now…

1068
01:23:19,073 --> 01:23:22,031
反正你也不會買這小鬼
Sin'e as you won't pay a penny for this pickaninny here…

1069
01:23:24,774 --> 01:23:27,745
你不介意我隨便怎麼處置吧
you won't mind me handlin' this nigger anyway I see fit?

1070
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:30,420
他是你的奴隸
He's your nigger.

1071
01:23:34,539 --> 01:23:35,812
斯通瑟先生？
Mr. Stonesipher?

1072
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:40,755
讓瑪莎和她的好夥伴們 送達達尼昂上黑鬼的天堂吧
Let Marsha and her bitches send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.

1073
01:23:41,594 --> 01:23:44,685
瑪莎！把黑鬼弄來！
Marsha! Git the nigger!

1074
01:24:23,537 --> 01:24:25,881
你的頭兒似乎還不大適應這些啊
Your boss looks a little green around the gills

1075
01:24:25,882 --> 01:24:27,794
還要加入這血腥的黑人打架事業？
for a blood sport like 'nigger fightin'?

1076
01:24:28,039 --> 01:24:29,093
沒有
No.

1077
01:24:29,734 --> 01:24:32,893
他只是不習慣看到一個人被狗咬死而已
He just ain't use to seein' a man ripped apart by dogs, is all.

1078
01:24:35,612 --> 01:24:37,002
那你挺習慣的？
You are used to it?

1079
01:24:37,237 --> 01:24:40,737
我只是比他更習慣美國
I'm just a little more use to American's than he is.

1080
01:24:41,383 --> 01:24:44,413
坎迪先生
Now… Monsieur Candy,

1081
01:24:45,064 --> 01:24:46,624
隨時等你準備好
whenever you're ready.

1082
01:24:47,023 --> 01:24:49,731
我們已經走了五小時了，讓你來展示庫存
We rode five hours so you could show off your stock.

1083
01:24:50,396 --> 01:24:52,216
談正事吧
Let's git to it.

1084
01:24:53,519 --> 01:24:55,612
因為目前來看，如果這個人也是...
Cause as of now, if he's an example…

1085
01:24:56,105 --> 01:24:57,225
我可不大滿意
I ain't impressed.

1086
01:24:59,963 --> 01:25:01,363
跟我來
Follow me.

1087
01:26:58,899 --> 01:27:00,631
在左邊站好隊
Line up to the left here now niggers.

1088
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:06,860
這就對了
That's it.

1089
01:27:09,698 --> 01:27:11,578
站直線，站直線
You gimme a line, gimme a line.

1090
01:27:11,655 --> 01:27:13,710
站好直線，馬上！
Get in line here. Right now!

1091
01:28:13,245 --> 01:28:15,070
你好啊，斯蒂文！
Hello, Steven my boy!

1092
01:28:15,109 --> 01:28:17,356
啊啊，你好啊主子
Yeah yeah yeah, hello my ass.

1093
01:28:17,838 --> 01:28:20,710
那個騎馬的黑人是誰啊
Who this nigger up on that nag?

1094
01:28:21,101 --> 01:28:22,661
哦斯蒂文，你早飯不是吃了馬肉嗎
Oh Steven, you have nags for breakfast.

1095
01:28:23,075 --> 01:28:25,666
怎麼啦，怎麼脾氣這麼壞， 是想我了嗎？
What's the matter, why so ornery, you miss me, huh?

1096
01:28:25,696 --> 01:28:30,014
哦哦當然了，我想你就像屋子想念鮮花
Oh-oh yes sir, I miss you like a home miss flower,

1097
01:28:30,108 --> 01:28:34,176
像嬰兒想念媽媽的奶
like a - like a- a baby miss Mum n' Teddy,

1098
01:28:34,824 --> 01:28:39,047
就像我想念鞋子堛漸衈Y
I miss you like I misses a rock in my shoe.

1099
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:45,710
我得問問你， 那匹馬上的黑人是誰啊？
Now I ask you: who this nigger, on that nag?

1100
01:28:45,758 --> 01:28:46,662
嘿白頭髮的
Hey Snowball.

1101
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:51,880
如果你想知道我叫什麼， 或者我的馬叫什麼，自己問我
If you wanna know my name or the name of my horse, you ask me.

1102
01:28:52,475 --> 01:28:55,199
騎馬的，你叫誰白頭髮呢？
Just who the hell you callin' Snowball, horse boy?

1103
01:28:55,310 --> 01:28:58,081
我會一巴掌把你的屁股揍下來摔地上...
 I'll snap your black ass of that nag there in the mud-

1104
01:28:58,144 --> 01:29:00,774
哇哦，哇哦，斯蒂文，斯蒂文
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Steven, Steven.

1105
01:29:01,562 --> 01:29:02,598
娛樂點嘛
Let's keep it funny.

1106
01:29:03,031 --> 01:29:04,645
這位姜戈，是自由人
Django here is a Freeman.

1107
01:29:05,544 --> 01:29:07,344
- 這個黑鬼？ - 正是他
– This nigger here? – That nigger there.

1108
01:29:07,821 --> 01:29:09,967
讓我至少介紹介紹你們倆吧
Let me at least introduce the two of you.

1109
01:29:10,334 --> 01:29:14,120
姜戈，這是另外一個 跟你一樣態度惡劣的黑人，斯蒂文
Django, this is another cheeky black bugger like yourself, Steven.

1110
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:15,917
斯蒂文，這是姜戈
 Steven, this is Django.

1111
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,591
你們倆肯定要恨死對方
You two ought to hate each other.

1112
01:29:17,756 --> 01:29:21,863
卡爾文，這黑鬼到底誰啊你還要取悅他？
Calvin, just who the hell is this nigger you feel the need to entertain?

1113
01:29:21,967 --> 01:29:25,769
姜戈，以及他的朋友，穿灰衣服的 舒爾茲醫生，是我們的顧客
Django, and his friend in grey here Dr. Schultz are customers,

1114
01:29:26,066 --> 01:29:27,618
也是我們的客人，斯蒂文
and they are our guests, Steven,

1115
01:29:27,627 --> 01:29:31,568
你這老混蛋，一定要好客點啊
and you, you old decrepit bastard, are to show them every hospitality.

1116
01:29:31,607 --> 01:29:33,753
- 懂了沒？ - 是，我正在試著弄懂
You understand that? – Yessir, here I'm understandin',

1117
01:29:33,758 --> 01:29:35,727
但我還是不明白我幹嘛要對這黑鬼說好話？
 but I don't know why I gotta take lip off this nigger?

1118
01:29:35,761 --> 01:29:38,761
你不需要知道為什麼，明白了？
You don't hafta know why. Do you understand?

1119
01:29:39,263 --> 01:29:41,229
是，我明白了
Yes sir, I understand.

1120
01:29:41,323 --> 01:29:42,443
好的！
Oh good!

1121
01:29:42,671 --> 01:29:45,692
他們要住一晚，去客房收拾兩間出來
They're spendin' the night, go up in the guest bedrooms and get two ready.

1122
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:48,581
他還要呆在這大宅堙H
He gonna stay in the Big House?

1123
01:29:48,647 --> 01:29:50,995
斯蒂文，他是做買賣奴隸的，不一樣的
Steven, he's a slaver. It's different.

1124
01:29:51,046 --> 01:29:52,395
要住這大宅？
In the Big House?

1125
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:53,804
你難道有問題啊？
Well you gotta problem with that?

1126
01:29:53,827 --> 01:29:56,260
不不不，我沒問題
No, no no I got no problem with it,

1127
01:29:56,315 --> 01:29:59,117
我是覺得他們會吧床啊床單啊枕頭啊都燒了
with you I gotta problem with burnin' the bed, the sheets, the pillow cases,

1128
01:29:59,130 --> 01:30:01,156
等他那黑不溜秋的傢伙一走就會！
ev'rything up when this black ass motherfuckers gone!

1129
01:30:01,179 --> 01:30:03,166
那也是我的問題，燒也是燒我的
Now that is my problem, they are mine to burn!

1130
01:30:03,305 --> 01:30:05,623
你的問題就是要給我留個好印象
Now your problem right now is making a good impression.

1131
01:30:05,723 --> 01:30:07,920
我需要你現在就開始著手解決這個問題
And I want you to start solving that problem right now,

1132
01:30:07,954 --> 01:30:09,584
快把他們的房間收拾好！
and git them goddamn rooms ready!

1133
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:12,889
是的，坎迪先生
Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.

1134
01:30:14,862 --> 01:30:16,262
快去吧
Go on now.

1135
01:30:17,104 --> 01:30:19,554
真不敢相信你帶個黑鬼來大宅堶
Can't believe you brought a nigger to stay in the Big House.

1136
01:30:19,641 --> 01:30:21,563
你接管這房子還真是無法無天了
You get a rollin' over and it's God man free right now.

1137
01:30:21,564 --> 01:30:22,220
他對你意見很大啊
He had a lip on you.

1138
01:30:22,412 --> 01:30:24,823
黑鬼來我們莊園，怎麼回事啊
A nigger in the estate part. What shit is that!?

1139
01:30:24,886 --> 01:30:26,006
好了
Now.

1140
01:30:26,199 --> 01:30:30,493
我美若天僊的姐姐呢！
Where is my beautiful sister!

1141
01:30:31,019 --> 01:30:32,384
在這兒呢！
There she is!

1142
01:30:34,462 --> 01:30:39,303
舒爾茲醫生，這位美麗的南方少婦 就是我守寡的姐姐
Dr. Schultz, this attractive southern belle is my widowed sister.

1143
01:30:39,683 --> 01:30:43,610
親愛的，你就是我們眼中的明珠
Darling, you are a diamond for tired eyes.

1144
01:30:44,729 --> 01:30:48,211
向大家介紹一下， 這位是勞拉·李·坎迪-菲茲威利
May I present to you Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.

1145
01:30:48,274 --> 01:30:51,764
切斯特，羅尼，查理，快點去那座山
Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charlie, you'll git your ass up on that hill.

1146
01:30:51,795 --> 01:30:53,139
快點查理，走了
Com'on Charlie, go on now.

1147
01:30:53,162 --> 01:30:55,144
走，快點，你知道在哪
Go, com'on now. You know where it is.

1148
01:30:55,613 --> 01:30:57,009
像被繩子拴著一樣快點！
Like you on a rope!

1149
01:30:58,281 --> 01:31:00,696
黑鬼不許慢慢走！跑起來！
Niggers don't walk 'round here! Niggers run!

1150
01:31:01,523 --> 01:31:03,623
- 啊，坎迪先生？ - 嗯？
– Ah, Monsieur Candie? – Hmm?

1151
01:31:05,924 --> 01:31:08,765
關於那件事，我們說到那個黑人女孩的？
About that matter, about the nigger girl we were talking about?

1152
01:31:08,945 --> 01:31:09,804
黑人女孩？
Nigger girl?

1153
01:31:09,909 --> 01:31:13,208
你說過她會說德語的？
Yeah, I believe you mentioned she spoke German?

1154
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:15,780
啊是啊，希爾蒂，她怎麼了？
Ah yes, Hildi, what about her?

1155
01:31:16,130 --> 01:31:20,416
你覺得在展示商品之前 能讓她來我房間嗎？
Do you think before the demonstration you could send her around to my room?

1156
01:31:20,806 --> 01:31:23,077
你這狡猾的傢伙！
You little Dickens, you!

1157
01:31:23,903 --> 01:31:24,803
為什麼不呢
I don't see why not.

1158
01:31:24,828 --> 01:31:27,958
斯蒂文，你帶他們去房間以後，叫希爾蒂去
Steven, when you get through showing them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi,

1159
01:31:27,988 --> 01:31:31,446
讓她洗洗乾淨，弄點香， 送去舒爾茲醫生的房間
get her cleaned up and smellin' nice, and sent over to Dr. Schultz's room.

1160
01:31:31,491 --> 01:31:36,176
其實呢，坎迪先生... 我還有事情沒告訴你
Actually, Monsieur Candie, it's- it's somethin' I ain't tole you that yet.

1161
01:31:36,497 --> 01:31:37,012
什麼事？
What?

1162
01:31:37,097 --> 01:31:39,712
希爾蒂還在那個熱盒子塈b著
Uh, Hildi in The Hot Box.

1163
01:31:41,811 --> 01:31:43,024
她在那幹嘛？
What's she doin' there?

1164
01:31:43,117 --> 01:31:46,582
你覺得她在幹嘛，熱盒子嘛， 她在受懲罰呢
What 'cha think she doin' there, in The Hot Box, she bein' punished.

1165
01:31:47,390 --> 01:31:49,544
- 她怎麼了？ - 她又逃跑了
– What did she do? – She ran off again.

1166
01:31:50,202 --> 01:31:52,965
我的天哪斯蒂文，我不在的時候多少人逃跑了啊？
Jesus Christ Steven, how many people ran away while I was gone?

1167
01:31:53,012 --> 01:31:53,918
就倆
Two.

1168
01:31:54,365 --> 01:31:55,498
她什麼時候跑的？
And when did she go?

1169
01:31:55,581 --> 01:31:58,581
昨晚，他們...他們今早把她抓回來的
Last night, they- they brought her back this morning.

1170
01:31:58,785 --> 01:32:01,243
斯通瑟的狗把她咬成什麼樣了？
How bad did Stonesipher's dogs tear her up?

1171
01:32:01,808 --> 01:32:05,301
她還算幸運，狗都出去找達達尼昂了
Lucky for her, they was out chasin' D'Artagnan's ass.

1172
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:09,418
比爾和科迪出去找她的， 然後帶回來了
Bill and Cody went out lookin' for her, found her and brought her back, uh…

1173
01:32:10,078 --> 01:32:11,209
她現在被折磨得厲害
Now she a little beat up,

1174
01:32:11,270 --> 01:32:14,310
但她那都是自找的， 自己在灌木叢堶捷]
but- but she done that the all damn self, runnin' through them damn bushes and shit.

1175
01:32:14,404 --> 01:32:15,794
她在盒子塈b多久了？
How long she been in the box?

1176
01:32:16,054 --> 01:32:19,044
你覺得多久了，都在堶惜@整天了！
How long ya think, she been in there all damn day!

1177
01:32:19,177 --> 01:32:22,284
這小婊子還有10天要呆呢
And the lit'le bitch got ten more days be in there.

1178
01:32:22,541 --> 01:32:23,845
斯蒂文，放她出來
Steven, take her out.

1179
01:32:23,971 --> 01:32:25,207
放她出來？為什麼？！
Take her out, why?!

1180
01:32:25,293 --> 01:32:27,254
因為我說的，就這樣
Because I said so, that's why.

1181
01:32:27,299 --> 01:32:29,179
舒爾茲醫生是我的客人
Dr. Schultz is my guest.

1182
01:32:29,313 --> 01:32:33,812
希爾蒂是我的奴僕，南方人民很好客的， 我必須讓她可以見客
Hildi is my nigger, Southern hospitality dictates I make her available to him.

1183
01:32:33,881 --> 01:32:36,119
但坎迪先生，她才剛試圖逃跑過
But Monsieur Candie, she just ran off.

1184
01:32:36,158 --> 01:32:39,711
天哪斯蒂文， 我們養個說德語的黑奴是為什麼呢，
Jesus Christ Steven, what is the point of havin' a nigger that speaks German,

1185
01:32:39,797 --> 01:32:42,177
不就是有德國客人的時候拉出來接客的嗎？
if you can't wheel 'em out when you have a German guest?

1186
01:32:42,381 --> 01:32:46,450
我知道對你來說還挺不方便的， 但是，放她出來
Now I realize it is inconvenient but still, you take her ass out!

1187
01:32:46,591 --> 01:32:47,442
是的
Yes sir.

1188
01:32:49,058 --> 01:32:52,329
勞拉，你能不能和科拉一起
Lara Lee, will you and Cora be responsible for getting

1189
01:32:52,349 --> 01:32:55,349
負責把希爾蒂清理乾淨， 讓她可以見舒爾茲醫生？
Hilda cleaned up and presentable for Dr. Schultz here?

1190
01:32:55,384 --> 01:32:56,784
沒問題親愛的
Of course, darling.

1191
01:32:56,929 --> 01:33:01,924
先生們，十分抱歉， 我真是累壞了，無以言表
Now gentlemen, I do apologize, but I'm wearer for our travels beyond words,

1192
01:33:02,072 --> 01:33:04,893
我得先休息休息了
it is time for me to rest my tired ass.

1193
01:33:09,704 --> 01:33:12,389
你們都聽到了，全部都去幹活
Ya'all have heard the man, get yar ass, all part of it.

1194
01:33:12,919 --> 01:33:14,646
來！過來！
Go! Come here!

1195
01:33:15,311 --> 01:33:18,410
去那邊讓她洗洗乾淨， 帶她去醫生那
Get over there, get her cleaned up, bring her back over here to doctor

1196
01:33:18,418 --> 01:33:20,237
你...叫什麼名字，舒...
what- what did you say your name is, Schut?

1197
01:33:20,410 --> 01:33:21,847
- 舒爾茲 - 舒爾茲！
– Schultz. – Schultz!

1198
01:33:22,236 --> 01:33:24,022
把她帶回這堥
Git her back over here, alright girl?

1199
01:33:24,069 --> 01:33:25,469
是
Yes sir.

1200
01:34:43,464 --> 01:34:47,102
希爾達，你是跟我來呢， 還是打算繼續在那個盒子媞帡琚H
Hilda, you comin’ with me, or you gonna sleep in that lit'le box over here?

1201
01:36:22,237 --> 01:36:23,594
女士們好
Hello ladies.

1202
01:36:23,688 --> 01:36:27,170
舒爾茲醫生，這位就是布隆希達
Dr. Schultz, may I introduce to you Broomhilda.

1203
01:36:31,310 --> 01:36:33,409
希爾蒂，這位是舒爾茲醫生
Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.

1204
01:36:35,451 --> 01:36:37,566
很高興見到你，布隆希達
It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.

1205
01:36:38,603 --> 01:36:40,931
我聽說了你很多好的事情
I've heard a lot of good things about you.

1206
01:36:41,002 --> 01:36:44,502
說德語的黑人可不多啊，不是嗎？
Well, it's not often a nigger speaks German, don't you know?

1207
01:36:47,180 --> 01:36:49,443
我現在看著你，布隆希達
As I look at you now, Broomhilda,

1208
01:36:49,545 --> 01:36:53,427
所有那些由你點燃的熱情都變得合理
I could see all the passion you inspire completely justified.

1209
01:36:57,632 --> 01:36:59,732
這位醫生也會說德語！
The doctor here speaks German!

1210
01:37:01,899 --> 01:37:04,099
我聽說你也會，是嗎？
And I've been informed you do as well?

1211
01:37:05,323 --> 01:37:07,486
乖孩子，說幾句德語
Go ahead girl, speak a little German.

1212
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,000
能跟您說德語我很高興

1213
01:37:15,937 --> 01:37:17,483
令人驚嘆啊
Astonishing.

1214
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
進來吧，姑娘

1215
01:37:24,844 --> 01:37:27,313
- 還需要我... - 非常感謝
– And I should bring- – Much obliged.

1216
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,000
需要我給你倒杯水嗎？

1217
01:38:00,981 --> 01:38:02,293
不要害怕
Don't be afraid.

1218
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
不好意思

1219
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:17,000
我想你應該很久沒有說過德語了

1220
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,000
所以我慢慢說

1221
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,000
我現在跟你說德語是以防 坎迪的人在偷聽

1222
01:38:41,819 --> 01:38:42,939
不好意思
Pardon.

1223
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
你真美

1224
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
謝謝

1225
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,000
我和一個我們共同的朋友

1226
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
經歷了重重困難

1227
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:11,000
走了無數的路

1228
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:14,000
來找到你，姑娘

1229
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
來解救你

1230
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
喝點水吧

1231
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,000
現在，我和這位我們共同的朋友目的都是

1232
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
把你永遠的帶離這

1233
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:35,000
我沒有朋友

1234
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
你當然有了

1235
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
誰？

1236
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:44,500
我不能告訴你

1237
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:50,000
這位朋友呢，很風騷，想要搞得戲劇化一點

1238
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
那他現在在哪？

1239
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
就站在那扇門後

1240
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:10,000
向我保證你不會尖叫？

1241
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,000
說，「我保證」

1242
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
我保證

1243
01:40:37,459 --> 01:40:38,858
嘿小搗蛋鬼
Hey Little Trouble Maker.

1244
01:40:48,044 --> 01:40:50,444
你這油嘴滑舌的傢伙
You silver tongued devil you.

1245
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
動作快點

1246
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,000
不不不，那是晚上喝的，去樓下...

1247
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:01,000
- 真是太麻煩了 - 最喜歡他的人是你吧

1248
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
你知道我喜歡什麼的

1249
01:41:06,701 --> 01:41:12,238
坎迪先生，他們都是很好的人選， 毫無疑問
Look Monsieur Candie, they were all fine specimens, no doubt about it.

1250
01:41:12,605 --> 01:41:15,423
但目前最好的三個是
But the best three, by far, were:

1251
01:41:15,751 --> 01:41:17,009
桑森...
Sampson…

1252
01:41:17,648 --> 01:41:19,608
- 那個人叫什麼來著？ - 高迪
Well, what's his name again? – Goldie.

1253
01:41:20,007 --> 01:41:22,872
高迪，還有愛斯基摩人喬
Goldie… and Eskimo Joe.

1254
01:41:23,505 --> 01:41:25,760
順便問問他為什麼叫愛斯基摩人喬？
By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?

1255
01:41:25,827 --> 01:41:29,237
哦，你永遠別想知道這些外號怎麼來的
Oh, you never know how these nigger nicknames get started.

1256
01:41:29,352 --> 01:41:32,873
他本來叫喬，可能突然有一天 他說他覺得自己好冷呢，誰知道
His name was Joe, maybe one day he said he was cold, who knows?

1257
01:41:36,013 --> 01:41:37,253
不論如何
Well, regardless,

1258
01:41:37,787 --> 01:41:39,409
桑森是最好的
Samson's your best,

1259
01:41:39,637 --> 01:41:40,995
我們都知道了
we all know that,

1260
01:41:41,378 --> 01:41:45,117
你永遠不會賣的，我也看得出來， 他是冠軍的料
you will never sell him, and I can see why, he's a champion.

1261
01:41:45,198 --> 01:41:48,742
三個都是冠軍
Hm-hm-hm! All three are champions.

1262
01:41:49,563 --> 01:41:51,123
桑森是冠軍
Samson's champion.

1263
01:41:51,901 --> 01:41:53,820
另外兩個屬於比較好的
Them other two pretty good.

1264
01:41:54,984 --> 01:41:56,554
卡爾文，那個黑鬼...你竟然讓...
Calvin, what that nigger- you let-

1265
01:41:56,563 --> 01:41:57,773
沒關係，沒關係
That's alright, that's alright.

1266
01:41:57,844 --> 01:41:59,802
你得瞭解，坎迪先生
You have to understand Monsieur Candie,

1267
01:41:59,914 --> 01:42:03,607
我雖然在這黑人打架生意堶惇O新手
while admittedly a neophyte in the nigger fight game,

1268
01:42:03,670 --> 01:42:07,749
我在歐洲巡迴馬戲團的生意方面 還是有點經驗的
I do have a little bit of a background in the European traveling circus.

1269
01:42:07,796 --> 01:42:09,145
是吧？
Is that right?

1270
01:42:09,421 --> 01:42:13,450
所以...說到展示，我還是有點想法的
Hence… I have big ideas when it comes to presentation.

1271
01:42:14,777 --> 01:42:17,166
我需要的不僅僅是個壯漢
I need something more than just a big nigger.

1272
01:42:19,126 --> 01:42:21,235
他必須...會表現
He needs to have… panache.

1273
01:42:21,382 --> 01:42:23,850
- 會幹嘛？ - 嗯...
– Need to have what what what? – Panache, hum…

1274
01:42:24,913 --> 01:42:27,575
- 會招攬顧客！ - 招攬顧客，嗯
– A sense of showmanship! – Showmanship, yes.

1275
01:42:27,612 --> 01:42:31,359
我希望可以把他稱作「黑色大力神」
I want to be able to bill him him as the “Black Hercules”.

1276
01:42:32,711 --> 01:42:34,497
黑色大力神，好名字啊
Black Hercules, isn't that clever?

1277
01:42:34,545 --> 01:42:36,003
聽上去就像「特別黑」似的
More like niggerly.

1278
01:42:37,690 --> 01:42:39,602
我說過，再引用一次
I said, and I quote:

1279
01:42:40,306 --> 01:42:45,573
「我會為正確的黑人付高價」
 “I would pay top dollar for the Right Nigger”.

1280
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:49,944
我不是說愛斯基摩人喬就是錯的...
Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger per se…

1281
01:42:50,944 --> 01:42:53,488
但他真的那麼值得我買嗎？
but is he right as rain?

1282
01:42:54,814 --> 01:42:57,999
舒爾茲醫生，我必須讓你知道
Dr. Schultz, I will have you know,

1283
01:42:58,065 --> 01:43:01,195
在黑人打鬥比賽堶
there is no one in the nigger fight game that appreciates

1284
01:43:01,210 --> 01:43:04,434
沒人會注重什麼表現能力， 大家都看重我卡爾文·坎迪的話
the value of showmanship more than Monsieur Calvin J. Candie.

1285
01:43:04,442 --> 01:43:05,442
確實
Nobody.

1286
01:43:05,694 --> 01:43:09,184
一個人不能忘記這打鬥比賽中最重要的東西
But one must not forget the most important thing in the nigger fight game.

1287
01:43:09,291 --> 01:43:12,343
就是這個黑人必須能打贏
And that is a nigger that can win fights.

1288
01:43:12,781 --> 01:43:16,997
這個必須是你前五需要考慮的吧
Now that should be your first, second, third, four, and fifth concern.

1289
01:43:17,135 --> 01:43:19,382
有了這個，你確信自己掌握了這個
Now after you have that, and you know you have that,

1290
01:43:19,435 --> 01:43:22,585
你才開始考慮包裝問題
then you can start to implement a grand design.

1291
01:43:23,504 --> 01:43:26,105
換句話說，第一總是優先
In other words, first thing is first.

1292
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:28,285
第一優先
First thing is first.

1293
01:43:36,716 --> 01:43:39,116
我看你倆打得火熱嘛
I see you two gettin' on.

1294
01:43:39,643 --> 01:43:41,323
哥擅長的
Famously.

1295
01:43:41,667 --> 01:43:44,312
哦坎迪先生，你無法想像
Oh Monsieur Candie, you can't imagine what it's like

1296
01:43:44,313 --> 01:43:47,758
四年沒聽過母語是什麼感覺
not to hear you native tongue in four years.

1297
01:43:48,012 --> 01:43:50,673
好吧，我都不能想像 在波士頓呆兩周是什麼樣
Well hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.

1298
01:43:52,241 --> 01:43:55,498
在波士頓呆兩周， 哦這真是，哈哈哈
Two weeks in Boston, oh that's your- oh man!

1299
01:43:57,071 --> 01:43:58,633
在波士頓呆兩周！
Ah, two weeks in Boston!

1300
01:43:58,996 --> 01:44:04,462
能用母語交談，這喜悅真是無法表達
I can't express the joy I felt conversing in my mother tongue.

1301
01:44:04,521 --> 01:44:08,948
希爾蒂是一個很好的聊天夥伴
And Hildi is a charming conversation companion.

1302
01:44:09,042 --> 01:44:11,008
當心哦舒爾茲醫生
Ah be careful now Doctor Schultz,

1303
01:44:11,171 --> 01:44:13,801
你可能有點太迷戀黑人了
you might have caught yourself a little dose of Nigella.

1304
01:44:14,138 --> 01:44:16,503
這種迷戀可是很厲害的
Nigella's a powerful emotion, boy.

1305
01:44:16,558 --> 01:44:20,001
就像一個充滿黑色焦油的池子， 一旦抓住你，你就不能...
It's like a pool of black tar, once it catches your ass, you can't-

1306
01:44:20,071 --> 01:44:21,876
是啊，就完了
Yessir, you can't.

1307
01:44:23,223 --> 01:44:27,728
我可不知道啊醫生， 你可以把德語的甜言蜜語都甩出來
I don't know doctor, you can lay on all the German sweet talk you want, but

1308
01:44:27,776 --> 01:44:30,536
但這位姑娘的眼神都在姜戈身上呢
it looks like this pony's got big eyes for Django.

1309
01:44:34,302 --> 01:44:40,292
一般情況下，她的確會注意翱翔的雄鷹吧
Well… naturally, it is the soaring eagle that attracts her attention,

1310
01:44:40,383 --> 01:44:42,784
而不是撲騰的雞崽子
not the plucked chicken.

1311
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,646
舒爾茲醫生，不要這麼貶低你自己
Dr. Schultz, don't be so down on yourself,

1312
01:44:46,664 --> 01:44:48,372
您是位風流倜儻的歐洲紳士
you are quite a dapper European gentleman.

1313
01:44:48,396 --> 01:44:51,678
你要弄完這個，要把手臂放進去，聽到沒有...
You gotta finish this, you got to put your elbow in this, this is, do you hear me-

1314
01:44:51,728 --> 01:44:54,124
你認識那個黑鬼的，是吧？
You know that nigger, don't ya?

1315
01:44:55,045 --> 01:44:56,218
- 誰？ - 誰？
– Who? – Who?

1316
01:44:56,294 --> 01:44:59,057
別跟我誰誰的婊子， 你知道我在說誰
Don't who me bitch, you know who I'm talking about!?

1317
01:45:01,078 --> 01:45:02,368
桌上那個？
At the table?

1318
01:45:03,296 --> 01:45:04,720
我不認識他
I don't know him.

1319
01:45:04,888 --> 01:45:06,107
你不認識他？
You don't know him?

1320
01:45:06,606 --> 01:45:07,656
不認識
No.

1321
01:45:07,874 --> 01:45:09,054
不什麼？
No what?

1322
01:45:09,334 --> 01:45:10,741
不，先生
No sir.

1323
01:45:15,544 --> 01:45:17,422
你現在沒膽向我撒謊，是吧？
You wouldn't lie to me now, would you?

1324
01:45:22,134 --> 01:45:23,342
好吧…
Okay…

1325
01:45:24,707 --> 01:45:27,611
那就信你
If- if you say so.

1326
01:45:34,003 --> 01:45:37,320
愛斯基摩人喬是個不錯的選手， 毫無疑問
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger, no doubt about it.

1327
01:45:39,181 --> 01:45:40,409
但如果錢在我手堛爾...
But if it was my money…

1328
01:45:42,053 --> 01:45:44,105
我是不會付一萬二給他的
I wouldn't pay no twelve thousand dollars for him.

1329
01:45:44,408 --> 01:45:46,293
你會開價多少？
What would your price be?

1330
01:45:46,885 --> 01:45:48,870
如果我可以大方一點的話
Well, if I was inclined to be generous,

1331
01:45:48,948 --> 01:45:52,174
我也不知道我幹嘛要大方一點...
and I don't know why I would be inclined to be generous…

1332
01:45:53,292 --> 01:45:54,360
九千...
nine thousand…

1333
01:45:55,891 --> 01:45:56,832
可能吧
maybe.

1334
01:45:57,725 --> 01:45:59,125
舒爾茲醫生
Dr. Schultz…

1335
01:45:59,709 --> 01:46:03,644
我想再搞搞清楚這個講價是怎麼回事啊
Let me reclarify how this whole negotiation came about.

1336
01:46:03,988 --> 01:46:06,235
你看，不是我找你來賣黑人給你的吧
You see, it wasn't me who came to you to sell a nigger,

1337
01:46:06,252 --> 01:46:07,032
當然不是
Sure, it wasn't.

1338
01:46:07,054 --> 01:46:09,165
是你來找我跟我買的
It was you who approached me to buy one.

1339
01:46:09,181 --> 01:46:10,047
當然
Sure it was.

1340
01:46:10,101 --> 01:46:12,833
現在你那聰明人跟我講的九千塊
Now that nine thousand dollar figure Bright Boy was banding about,

1341
01:46:12,850 --> 01:46:14,105
這數字其實跟實際價錢差不多了
that ain't too far off from right,

1342
01:46:14,108 --> 01:46:15,769
如果我想給愛斯基摩人喬賣這個價錢
and if I wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that,

1343
01:46:15,784 --> 01:46:17,539
我隨便哪天都能賣出去
I could do so any day of the week.

1344
01:46:17,551 --> 01:46:18,566
隨便哪天
Any day.

1345
01:46:18,982 --> 01:46:21,104
但正如你在格林威爾所說的，醫生，
But like you said in Greenville doctor,

1346
01:46:21,293 --> 01:46:22,963
我不想賣
I don't wanna sell 'em.

1347
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:26,531
只是因為你開了個天價
It was only your ridiculous offer

1348
01:46:26,550 --> 01:46:29,836
說是一萬二，我才考慮的
of twelve thousand dollars that made me even consider it.

1349
01:46:29,852 --> 01:46:31,252
嗯
Hmm-hmm.

1350
01:46:39,118 --> 01:46:43,311
坎迪先生啊，你的確比我要能說會道一些
You know Monsieur Candie, you do possess the power of persuasion.

1351
01:46:47,601 --> 01:46:52,137
為什麼不買呢，坎迪先生，成交， 愛斯基摩人喬，一萬二！
Why not, Monsieur Candie, you have a deal, Eskimo Joe, twelve thousand dollars!

1352
01:46:52,208 --> 01:46:55,393
好啊，醫生，太好了， 明智的決定！
Hurray, doctor, hurray, and a wise decision, that is!

1353
01:46:55,455 --> 01:46:58,866
不過呢，這真是很大一筆錢
However, that is a tremendous amount of money.

1354
01:46:59,161 --> 01:47:02,338
如同你有摩吉先生一樣，我也有個律師
And the way you have your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer,

1355
01:47:02,387 --> 01:47:04,377
一個很小氣的男人，叫塔圖
a persnickety man named Tuttle,

1356
01:47:04,517 --> 01:47:07,694
我需要他幫我起草一份法律文書
And I would need my Mr. Tuttle to draw up a legal contract

1357
01:47:07,708 --> 01:47:11,705
在我放心完成這麼巨大一份交易之前
before I'd feel comfortable exchanging that amount of money for flesh.

1358
01:47:11,979 --> 01:47:15,390
以及我還需要自己選一位醫生 來為愛斯基摩人喬做體檢
Not to mention having Eskimo Joe examined by a physician of my choosing.

1359
01:47:15,444 --> 01:47:16,844
那是自然
Naturally.

1360
01:47:16,875 --> 01:47:21,097
所以我們大概...
So say I return in about…

1361
01:47:23,690 --> 01:47:25,790
- 五天之後回來 - 五天？
.. five days time. – Five days ?!

1362
01:47:25,969 --> 01:47:28,826
我和我的律師塔圖一起
With my Mr. Tuttle. And then my Mr. Tuttle

1363
01:47:28,850 --> 01:47:32,340
然後他和摩吉先生會自己商討合同細節的
and your Mr. Moguy can hash out the finer details between themselves.

1364
01:47:33,474 --> 01:47:36,339
好極了，醫生，好極了
I say splendid Doctor… Splendid.

1365
01:47:37,152 --> 01:47:38,552
先生們...
Gentlemen…

1366
01:47:39,464 --> 01:47:40,928
我提議敬酒
may I propose a toast…

1367
01:47:43,695 --> 01:47:47,468
敬愛斯基摩人喬。哦，我們該叫他
to Eskimo Joe. Or, shall we call him

1368
01:47:47,778 --> 01:47:49,598
黑色大力神
the Black Hercules.

1369
01:47:49,922 --> 01:47:51,656
敬黑色大力神
To the Black Hercules.

1370
01:47:51,774 --> 01:47:53,019
敬黑色大力神！
The Black Hercules!

1371
01:47:53,277 --> 01:47:54,779
黑色大力神…
The Black Hercules…

1372
01:47:54,844 --> 01:47:58,060
你是對的，醫生， 這名字確實漲士氣
You was right, Doctor, that name do help pay an ass.

1373
01:48:00,388 --> 01:48:01,788
希爾蒂
Hildi…

1374
01:48:02,218 --> 01:48:03,456
我這兒沒有酒了
I'm outta drink, girl.

1375
01:48:06,689 --> 01:48:10,952
希爾蒂...在大宅子堶惆糽^一大桌人， 感覺怎麼樣？
So Hildi… how you like servin' at the big table in the big house, huh?

1376
01:48:11,957 --> 01:48:14,689
坎迪先生跟你說話了，你就回答
When Monsieur Candy talk to you, you answers.

1377
01:48:15,288 --> 01:48:17,121
我很喜歡，坎迪先生
I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.

1378
01:48:17,239 --> 01:48:18,145
嗯
Hmm-hmm.

1379
01:48:18,302 --> 01:48:20,216
比躺在那個滾燙的盒子媦R吼是好多了
It's a lot better than sizzling in that hot box,

1380
01:48:20,235 --> 01:48:22,635
或者是在荊棘叢堸k跑
or draggin' your ass through a bramble bush.

1381
01:48:22,709 --> 01:48:25,722
可能比不上曼丁戈那麼好玩啊
Maybe it's not quite as much fun as getting the pleasure o' the mandingos,

1382
01:48:25,753 --> 01:48:27,652
- 是吧甜心？ - 噢，她很喜歡看的
 huh sugar babe? – Hmm oh, she like them new.

1383
01:48:27,700 --> 01:48:30,213
- 比如桑森，是吧？ - 是
– Like Simpson, huh? – Yessir.

1384
01:48:30,549 --> 01:48:32,210
- 坎迪先生， - 嗯？
– You know Monsieur Candie, – Hmm?

1385
01:48:32,231 --> 01:48:35,924
醫生可能會有興趣看看 希爾蒂被鞭子抽過的背呢
the doctor here might be interested in seein' Hildi's peeled back,

1386
01:48:35,948 --> 01:48:39,234
他家鄉可沒有這麼多黑奴吧
since how they don't have many niggers where he come from.

1387
01:48:39,297 --> 01:48:42,036
舒爾茲醫生，你剛才跟希爾蒂在一起的時候
Dr. Schultz, when you was alone with Hildi here,

1388
01:48:42,059 --> 01:48:45,255
你們是只說了說德語，還是脫過衣服了？
did- didja just speak German, or did ya git her clothes off?

1389
01:48:45,287 --> 01:48:47,087
我們只是聊了聊...
No, we just talked and…

1390
01:48:47,138 --> 01:48:49,144
噢，所以你還沒見過她的背吧？
Oh so- so you haven't seen her back?

1391
01:48:49,336 --> 01:48:50,324
我沒有...
I haven't-

1392
01:48:50,434 --> 01:48:53,529
不不不，斯蒂文是對的， 你可能會感興趣
No no no, now Steven's right, you might find this interesting.

1393
01:48:53,589 --> 01:48:57,219
希爾蒂，快，把裙子脫了， 給醫生看看你的背，來啊！
Hildi, com'on take off your dress, show Dr. Schultz your back here, go on!

1394
01:48:57,258 --> 01:49:01,263
啊，卡爾文，我才把她打扮得漂漂亮亮的
Uh, Calvin, I just got her all dressed up and looking nice.

1395
01:49:01,365 --> 01:49:05,784
但是，勞拉，舒爾茲醫生是杜塞爾多夫來的， 他們那堨i沒有黑奴
But… Lara Lee, Dr. Schultz is from Dusseldorf,they don't got niggers there.

1396
01:49:05,993 --> 01:49:07,474
他又是學醫的
He's a man of medicine.

1397
01:49:07,631 --> 01:49:10,537
我肯定他會喜歡的，黑鬼對疼痛的忍耐力啊
I'm sure it would fascinate him, the niggers endurance for pain.

1398
01:49:10,639 --> 01:49:14,089
這些黑鬼很強硬的， 醫生，這毫無疑問
These niggers are tough Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.

1399
01:49:14,176 --> 01:49:16,595
希爾蒂悲傷大概有四條疤
Hilda's got somethin' like four lashes on her back.

1400
01:49:16,666 --> 01:49:19,054
勞拉，你... 幹嘛不把帶子解開？
Lare Lee, just get- why don't you lose her goddamn mat?

1401
01:49:19,086 --> 01:49:21,091
看看啊，醫生，就像一幅畫一樣，瞧瞧
Look a' that, doctor, it's like a painting, look at that.

1402
01:49:21,140 --> 01:49:22,190
卡爾文！
Calvin!

1403
01:49:23,096 --> 01:49:26,181
我們在吃飯，沒人想看她被鞭子打過的背！
We are eating, ain't no one wanna look at her whipped up back!

1404
01:49:28,197 --> 01:49:30,241
好好好...
Fine. Fine, fine fine fine…

1405
01:49:30,507 --> 01:49:32,981
吃完晚飯吧，斯蒂文，等吃完
After the dinner, Steven. After dinner.

1406
01:49:34,216 --> 01:49:35,715
等喝白蘭地的時候吧，先生們怎麼樣？
During the brandies, gentlemen. Uh?

1407
01:49:42,147 --> 01:49:44,247
科拉，過來把她帶走！
Cora, come get this girl!

1408
01:49:47,196 --> 01:49:49,498
- 她被弄得一團糟了 - 好的
She all messed. – Yes ma'am?

1409
01:49:49,951 --> 01:49:51,965
噢！怎麼都解開了？
Oh! Why are you all undone?

1410
01:49:52,012 --> 01:49:54,676
我才幫你穿好，快過來
I just got you done, now come over, here!

1411
01:50:01,077 --> 01:50:04,981
寶貝，你惹到斯蒂文不好的一面了， 你本應該站在他看不見的地方
Baby, you got Steven his bad side, when you need to be on his blind side.

1412
01:50:05,030 --> 01:50:07,168
你剛才說你不認識他？
You said you ain't know him?

1413
01:50:08,197 --> 01:50:09,332
啊？
Huh?

1414
01:50:09,469 --> 01:50:14,451
我說...你剛才說你不認識他
I said… you said you ain't know him.

1415
01:50:16,316 --> 01:50:17,876
我不認識
I don't.

1416
01:50:18,236 --> 01:50:19,559
你認識
Yes you do.

1417
01:50:21,730 --> 01:50:22,985
斯蒂文先生...
Mister Steven…

1418
01:50:24,393 --> 01:50:25,712
我不認識
I don't.

1419
01:50:25,907 --> 01:50:27,707
你幹嘛朝我撒謊？
Why is you lyin' to me?

1420
01:50:30,342 --> 01:50:31,678
我沒有
I ain't.

1421
01:50:32,156 --> 01:50:34,116
那你哭什麼？
Then why is you cry?

1422
01:50:35,017 --> 01:50:36,382
你嚇到我了
You scarin' me.

1423
01:50:36,622 --> 01:50:38,422
我怎麼就嚇到你了？
Why is I'm scarin' you?

1424
01:50:39,255 --> 01:50:40,955
因為你很嚇人
Because you scary.

1425
01:50:42,689 --> 01:50:49,077
今天下午能和希爾蒂用德語交談， 真是完完全全滋潤了我的靈魂啊
.. to speak German this afternoon with Hildi, was positively soul enriching.

1426
01:50:52,139 --> 01:50:54,863
好好在椅子上給我坐著
You stay in that chair.

1427
01:51:00,442 --> 01:51:05,041
你之前也提到你很樂意 希爾蒂參與到這次生意
You indicated earlier you'd be willing to part with Hildi.

1428
01:51:05,190 --> 01:51:07,953
是啊，當然
Oh yes. Yesiree Bob I did.

1429
01:51:09,860 --> 01:51:15,709
這樣的話...我想... 我還有個提議
In that case… allow me… to propose another proposition.

1430
01:51:16,084 --> 01:51:16,956
我聽著呢
I'm all ears.

1431
01:51:17,183 --> 01:51:19,003
快點，該死！
Hurry up, goddammit!

1432
01:51:19,969 --> 01:51:21,972
- 坎迪先生... - 斯蒂文！
Monsieur Candie- – Steven!

1433
01:51:22,434 --> 01:51:24,873
你剛才打斷了舒爾茲醫生說話了！
You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here!

1434
01:51:25,818 --> 01:51:30,948
嗯...對不起，醫生， 我耳朵已經不大好使了
Uhm… sorry doctor Schultz, my ears ain't worth a damn these days.

1435
01:51:32,308 --> 01:51:35,587
坎迪先生，我能跟你到廚房說句話嗎
Monsieur Candie, could I get a word with you in the kitchen.

1436
01:51:36,522 --> 01:51:38,480
你是讓我從椅子上起來？
You mean get up outta my chair?

1437
01:51:38,618 --> 01:51:40,410
如果你能行的話
If you could manage it.

1438
01:51:40,723 --> 01:51:41,843
幹嘛？
Why?

1439
01:51:42,135 --> 01:51:43,664
是關於甜點的
It's about dessert.

1440
01:51:43,778 --> 01:51:45,398
甜點怎麼了？
What about dessert?

1441
01:51:45,890 --> 01:51:48,559
我覺得還是私下談比較好
I'd rather discuss that in private.

1442
01:51:48,635 --> 01:51:50,695
我們要吃白奶油蛋糕
We're havin' white cake.

1443
01:51:50,931 --> 01:51:53,436
這道菜還能弄出什麼驚天動地的花樣啊？
What sort of melodrama could be brewing back there?

1444
01:51:53,585 --> 01:51:57,856
你是對的，坎迪先生，我自己解決就好
You right Monsieur Candy, you right, I'll handle it myself.

1445
01:51:58,002 --> 01:51:59,426
我們在圖書室見
Meet me in the library.

1446
01:51:59,755 --> 01:52:03,073
我就是不懂你今晚怎麼就不願跟我說話
I just can't understand why you won't come talk to the evening,

1447
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:04,983
她在這堶J來你竟然還怪我
she get fucked up 'round here, you blame me.

1448
01:52:05,078 --> 01:52:06,896
好，好吧斯蒂文，我...
Fine, fine friend Steven, I…

1449
01:52:08,107 --> 01:52:09,662
馬上就過去
will be along momentarily.

1450
01:52:10,409 --> 01:52:11,529
是
Yessir.

1451
01:52:12,363 --> 01:52:13,483
好吧…
Well…

1452
01:52:14,176 --> 01:52:15,134
先生們…
gentlemen…

1453
01:52:15,373 --> 01:52:18,175
你也看得出，廚房堻o幫人還是挺有天分的啊
as you can see, talented as they are no doubt in the kitchen,

1454
01:52:18,207 --> 01:52:21,962
但時不時的... 還是需要大人來指點一下
from time to time… adult supervision is required.

1455
01:52:24,869 --> 01:52:26,827
失陪一會兒
If you'll excuse me a moment.

1456
01:52:32,784 --> 01:52:34,884
你們可以開始換餐具了
You may clear the dinner service.

1457
01:52:38,915 --> 01:52:39,812
<i>動作快點</i>
<i>Hurry up girl.</i>

1458
01:52:39,966 --> 01:52:41,374
舒爾茲醫生...
So Dr. Schultz…

1459
01:52:41,804 --> 01:52:44,622
給我們講個馬戲團的故事怎樣？
Why don't you regal us with the tale of the circus?

1460
01:52:45,418 --> 01:52:47,035
馬戲團啊！
The circus!

1461
01:52:54,295 --> 01:52:56,095
怎麼回事？
What is the matter?

1462
01:53:01,404 --> 01:53:05,956
這群小兔崽子不是來買什麼打手的
Them motherfuckers ain't here to buy no mandingos.

1463
01:53:06,602 --> 01:53:08,058
他們想要那個女的
They wants that girl.

1464
01:53:10,313 --> 01:53:13,053
斯蒂文，你在說什麼呢？
Steven, what the hell are you talkin' about, hm?

1465
01:53:13,198 --> 01:53:16,477
他們把你當猴耍呢，我說的是這個
They playin' your ass for a fool, that what I'm talkin' bout.

1466
01:53:16,758 --> 01:53:20,123
他們來這堨i不是買什麼壯漢的
They ain't here for no muscle bound jimmie,

1467
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:22,271
是來買那個女孩的
they here for that girl.

1468
01:53:22,717 --> 01:53:25,278
什麼...什麼女孩？ 希爾蒂？
What… what girl. What… Hildi?

1469
01:53:25,308 --> 01:53:27,587
是啊，希爾蒂，她和姜戈？
Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django?

1470
01:53:27,908 --> 01:53:30,016
這兩個人以前就認識
Them niggers know each other.

1471
01:53:31,001 --> 01:53:32,717
他.. 他剛剛才買下愛斯基摩人喬啊
He… he just bought Eskimo Joe.

1472
01:53:32,722 --> 01:53:34,053
他給你錢了沒？
Did he give you any money?

1473
01:53:34,115 --> 01:53:35,209
不，還沒有，但他們...
No, not yet, but they go-

1474
01:53:35,229 --> 01:53:37,722
那他什麼都還沒買吧，目前來說
Then he didn't buy diddly, not yet no how.

1475
01:53:37,912 --> 01:53:43,152
但他剛剛要開口說買真正想買的人， 我正好打斷了
But he's just about to buy who he come here to buy, when I interrupted him.

1476
01:53:43,660 --> 01:53:46,337
謝謝你斯蒂文， 不客氣卡爾文
Thank you Steven. You're welcome Calvin.

1477
01:53:51,966 --> 01:53:54,213
你...你什麼時候發現的？
Whe- where you gettin' all this?

1478
01:53:55,002 --> 01:53:57,489
他們幹嘛繞這麼大一圈為了一個黑人...
Why would they go through all that trouble for a nigger with a-

1479
01:53:57,496 --> 01:53:59,913
背後被打得一塌糊塗的， 甚至都不值三百塊？
with a chewed up back, ain't worth three hundred dollars?

1480
01:54:00,095 --> 01:54:03,733
他們這樣是因為姜戈愛著希爾蒂
They're doin' it cause that nigger Django's in love with Hildi.

1481
01:54:04,265 --> 01:54:05,934
她很有可能是他的老婆
She probably his wife.

1482
01:54:06,172 --> 01:54:10,060
那那個德國人管那個狗娘養的黑人 愛著誰幹嘛啊
Now, why that German give a fuck who that uppity son-of-a-bitch is in love with,

1483
01:54:10,074 --> 01:54:12,274
我只能說我不知道
 I'm sure I don't know.

1484
01:54:15,039 --> 01:54:16,915
如果她才是他們的目標...
If she's who they want…

1485
01:54:17,330 --> 01:54:21,474
為什麼這... 這整件曼丁戈的事是幹嘛？
why this whole… snake oil pitch about mandingos in?

1486
01:54:21,836 --> 01:54:24,818
你平時是不會隨便就扔掉三百塊錢的吧
You wouldn't pay no never mind into three hundred dollar.

1487
01:54:25,670 --> 01:54:27,149
但有這一萬二的生意呢？
But that twelve thousand?

1488
01:54:28,457 --> 01:54:30,644
這讓你特友好了是吧
That made you real friendly now, didn'it?

1489
01:54:33,639 --> 01:54:35,039
的確
Yes it did.

1490
01:54:38,746 --> 01:54:39,879
他老婆，啊？
His wife, uh?

1491
01:54:44,652 --> 01:54:46,509
如果有蛇的話…
If it had been a snake…

1492
01:54:46,883 --> 01:54:48,290
我們已經弄死他們了
we would have beat'em.

1493
01:54:51,424 --> 01:54:56,289
這些騙人的…該死的時代…
Those lyin'… goddamn time…

1494
01:54:56,440 --> 01:54:59,979
狗娘養的，浪費我時間
wastin' sonsabitches.

1495
01:55:02,224 --> 01:55:03,784
狗雜種們!
Sonsabitches!

1496
01:55:03,917 --> 01:55:08,859
...離開了新奧爾良，我有了很多... 舞台經驗
.. out of New Orleans, so I had quite a bit of practice with… theaters types.

1497
01:55:10,095 --> 01:55:11,745
哦你在這呢
Oh there you are!

1498
01:55:11,845 --> 01:55:15,420
我還在想你是不是和那個老傢伙私奔了
I was beginning to think that you and that old crow ran off together.

1499
01:55:16,724 --> 01:55:18,831
要那樣就成大新聞了，是吧？
That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?

1500
01:55:19,099 --> 01:55:20,112
勞拉...
Lara Lee…

1501
01:55:20,354 --> 01:55:21,971
我剛才看到窗外
I was just lookin' out the big window.

1502
01:55:22,045 --> 01:55:23,972
比利·可拉什正在
Billy Crash is out there dealin' with some

1503
01:55:23,972 --> 01:55:26,368
跟一個狡猾的奴隸商交涉， 那人想賣幾頭馬駒
shady slaver try n' sellin' a passel of ponys,

1504
01:55:26,378 --> 01:55:29,617
親愛的你能不能出去派幾個人，幫我盯著點
would you be a dear and go out there give them gals an eyeball.

1505
01:55:30,501 --> 01:55:33,301
- 當然了，弟弟 - 謝謝你親愛的
– Of course, brother. – Thank you, darling.

1506
01:55:45,947 --> 01:55:49,360
好吧，生意是談不完的
Okay. Business never sleeps.

1507
01:55:51,654 --> 01:55:53,054
有個提議...
A propos…

1508
01:55:53,202 --> 01:55:58,932
你進來之前，我們還在討論 我能不能買下布隆希達
before your exit, we were discussing the possibility of my purchasing Broomhilda.

1509
01:55:59,027 --> 01:56:01,309
啊，我們會談的
Ah yes! Yes we would.

1510
01:56:02,028 --> 01:56:04,387
會談的，過一會兒
And we will again… in a moment.

1511
01:56:20,488 --> 01:56:22,588
這位朋友是誰啊？
Who is your little friend?

1512
01:56:27,750 --> 01:56:29,150
這是本...
This is Ben…

1513
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:35,248
他曾經是家僕 在這邊生活過很長時間的
He's a Ol'Joe that… lived around here for a long time.

1514
01:56:35,811 --> 01:56:37,911
我是說，真的很久
And I do mean a long damn time.

1515
01:56:39,303 --> 01:56:40,703
當老本在這...
Well Ben here…

1516
01:56:41,350 --> 01:56:43,170
照顧我的父親...
took care of my daddy…

1517
01:56:43,733 --> 01:56:45,553
和我父親的父親...
and my daddy's daddy…

1518
01:56:46,129 --> 01:56:48,275
直到後來有一天...
till the open kill doe who one day…

1519
01:56:51,377 --> 01:56:52,859
他也開始照料我
who been took care o'me.

1520
01:56:55,633 --> 01:56:59,537
在這樣一個密西西比州的 大農場主家長大
Growin'up the son of a… of a huge plantation owner in Mississippi

1521
01:56:59,551 --> 01:57:05,541
我這樣一個白人，跟所有的黑奴共事
puts a white men in contact with a whole lot o'… black faces.

1522
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:12,336
我這輩子都在這堳袡L... 就在這，坎迪園
I spent my whole life here… right here… in Candyland…

1523
01:57:13,704 --> 01:57:17,233
周圍都是...黑人
surrounded… by black faces.

1524
01:57:19,546 --> 01:57:22,614
每天都能見到他們，出門回家都看見
And seein' them ev'ry day, day in day out, I…

1525
01:57:23,216 --> 01:57:24,918
我只有一個問題啊
I only had one question.

1526
01:57:28,987 --> 01:57:30,620
他們幹嘛不殺了我們呢？
Why don't they kill us?

1527
01:57:34,727 --> 01:57:36,654
就在那邊那個門廊...
Now right up there on that porch…

1528
01:57:37,077 --> 01:57:39,568
五十年來，每週三次，
three times a week for fifty years,

1529
01:57:39,702 --> 01:57:44,262
這位本...會用刮鬍刀給我父親刮臉
Ol'Ben here… would shave my Daddy with a straight razor.

1530
01:57:45,004 --> 01:57:50,126
現在呢...如果我是老本， 我會一刀把我父親的喉嚨割了
Now… if I was Ol'Ben, I would have cut my Daddy's goddamn throat,

1531
01:57:50,185 --> 01:57:53,925
而且我完全不會等個50年再動手
and it wouldn't have taken me no fifty years to do it neither.

1532
01:57:56,276 --> 01:57:57,688
但他從未這麼做
But he never did.

1533
01:57:59,532 --> 01:58:00,652
為什麼呢？
Why not?

1534
01:58:02,186 --> 01:58:03,061
你們看...
You see…

1535
01:58:03,490 --> 01:58:05,818
「類比」這個手法的掌握…
the science of analogy…

1536
01:58:06,871 --> 01:58:12,071
關鍵就是要準確理解兩種事物的區別
is crucial to understandin' the… separation about two species.

1537
01:58:13,873 --> 01:58:16,277
這個黑人的頭骨呢…
In the skull of the African here…

1538
01:58:17,856 --> 01:58:20,228
負責「順從」的這部分區域
the area associated with submissiveness

1539
01:58:20,296 --> 01:58:25,559
比地球上其他人， 或者說其他種族的人都要大
is larger than any human or any other sup human species on planet earth.

1540
01:58:41,490 --> 01:58:43,310
如果檢查一下…
If you examine…

1541
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:46,690
這堻o片頭骨…
this peace of skull here…

1542
01:58:52,930 --> 01:58:56,982
你會看到有三個不同的凹陷
you'll notice three distinct dimples.

1543
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:03,574
這...這...還有這
Here… here… and here.

1544
01:59:04,019 --> 01:59:05,139
現在...
Now…

1545
01:59:05,449 --> 01:59:10,212
如果我手堛瑰Y骨 是牛頓或者伽利略的
If I was holding a skull of a- of a… of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,

1546
01:59:10,611 --> 01:59:14,882
這三個凹陷會發現存在於頭骨的...
these three dimples would be found in the area o'the skull most associated with…

1547
01:59:15,226 --> 01:59:16,626
負責創造性的部位
creativity.

1548
01:59:17,224 --> 01:59:19,324
但這個頭骨是老本的
Βut th??' th? ?kull ?f Οl'Β?n.

1549
01:59:20,036 --> 01:59:23,916
在老本的這個頭骨堜O，由基因決定
And in the skull of Ol'Ben, unburden by genes,

1550
01:59:24,513 --> 01:59:28,721
這三個凹陷所在的區域是...
these three dimples exist in the area of the skull most associated with…

1551
01:59:29,675 --> 01:59:31,075
負責奴性的
servility.

1552
01:59:32,394 --> 01:59:33,899
在座這位聰明人...
Now Bright Boy…

1553
01:59:34,767 --> 01:59:37,007
我承認你非常聰明
I will admit you are pretty clever.

1554
01:59:39,679 --> 01:59:41,342
但如果我用手上這把錘子
But if I took this hammer here…

1555
01:59:43,753 --> 01:59:45,750
敲碎你的頭骨...
and I bashed it in your skull…

1556
01:59:47,062 --> 01:59:49,445
你頭骨上這三個凹陷窩...
you would have the same three dimples….

1557
01:59:50,172 --> 01:59:51,966
會在同樣的地方
in the same place…

1558
01:59:53,794 --> 01:59:55,161
跟老本一樣
as Ol'Ben.

1559
01:59:57,420 --> 01:59:59,910
把你們的手全部平攤在桌面上！
Now lay your palms flat on the table top!

1560
02:00:00,008 --> 02:00:03,051
你們膽敢把手離開這鱉甲材質的桌面
If you lift those palms off that turtle shell table top,

1561
02:00:03,104 --> 02:00:06,349
布奇會把你們兩個全部打得腦袋開花！
Mr. Butch is gonna let loose with both barrels of that sawed off!

1562
02:00:07,454 --> 02:00:10,796
今晚這晚飯過程中扯謊的人太多了
There have been a latta lies said around this diner table here tonight,

1563
02:00:10,822 --> 02:00:12,446
但這句話你最好還是相信！
 but that you can believe!

1564
02:00:13,647 --> 02:00:14,754
摩吉先生
Mr. Moguy,

1565
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:18,618
能不能勞駕你把這兩位褲兜堛犖j拿走？
would you be so kind as to collect the pistol hangin' on those boys hips here?

1566
02:00:23,452 --> 02:00:24,832
非常感謝
Thank you ever so much.

1567
02:00:24,903 --> 02:00:26,023
醫生
Doctor.

1568
02:00:30,402 --> 02:00:31,681
剛才我們說到哪了
Where were we?

1569
02:00:36,180 --> 02:00:37,459
混球
Jackass.

1570
02:00:41,365 --> 02:00:42,804
哦對了
Oh yes…

1571
02:00:43,314 --> 02:00:48,077
我想你剛才正準備 跟我提議要買下布隆希達吧
I do believe you were just getting ready to make me a proposition to buy Broomhilda.

1572
02:00:48,751 --> 02:00:50,029
我沒說錯吧？
I am right?

1573
02:00:54,230 --> 02:00:55,120
沒錯
Right then.

1574
02:00:57,822 --> 02:00:59,321
把希爾蒂帶出來！
Bring out Hildi!

1575
02:01:02,509 --> 02:01:03,629
這邊走
Your way, honey.

1576
02:01:05,217 --> 02:01:07,417
跟我好好的在椅子上坐著！
Sit your ass in that goddamn chair!

1577
02:01:07,441 --> 02:01:08,886
把手放在桌面上
Lay your hands flat on that table.

1578
02:01:08,941 --> 02:01:10,761
給我閉嘴！
And shut your mouth!

1579
02:01:14,597 --> 02:01:18,986
舒爾茲醫生...在格林威爾， 你自己也說了，
Dr. Schultz… in Greenville, you yourself said,

1580
02:01:19,090 --> 02:01:21,251
為了那個「對的黑奴」
that for the “Right Nigger” you'd be willing to pay

1581
02:01:21,267 --> 02:01:24,400
你很樂意考慮付天價
what some may consider is a ridiculous amount.

1582
02:01:25,079 --> 02:01:28,053
我當時說，「你說的天價是多少？」
To which, me myself said, “What is your definition of ridiculous?”,

1583
02:01:28,081 --> 02:01:31,920
你說，「一萬二」。
to which you said, “Twelve thousand dollars”.

1584
02:01:32,989 --> 02:01:36,799
現在考慮到你們走了這麼遠的路
Now considering you all have ridden a whole lotta miles,

1585
02:01:36,961 --> 02:01:38,641
經歷了這麼多麻煩事
 went to a whole lotta trouble,

1586
02:01:38,940 --> 02:01:43,484
還浪費了這麼多口水 來買這位漂亮的女士
and done spread a whole lotta bull, to purchase this lovely lady right here,

1587
02:01:43,516 --> 02:01:48,810
那其實布隆希達才是真正的 「對的黑奴」吧！
it would appear that Broomhilda is in fact the “Right Nigger”!

1588
02:01:50,063 --> 02:01:52,740
如果你們想帶著布隆希達離開坎迪園...
And if y'all wanna leave Candyland with Broomhilda…

1589
02:01:53,829 --> 02:01:59,146
價錢還是一萬二
the price is twelve thousand dollars.

1590
02:01:59,539 --> 02:02:03,693
我想，你應該是遵循「買就買不買就滾」 的買賣方式吧
And I take it you prefer the “take it or leave it” style of negotiating?

1591
02:02:05,615 --> 02:02:07,435
的確，醫生
Yes I do, doctor.

1592
02:02:07,976 --> 02:02:14,106
你也知道，芝卡索縣的法律規定， 布隆希達屬於我的個人財產
You see, under the laws of Chickasaw County, Broomhilda here is my property.

1593
02:02:14,653 --> 02:02:19,869
對我自己的財產，我想幹嘛就幹嘛！
And I can chose to do with my property whatever I so desire!

1594
02:02:21,064 --> 02:02:27,608
你要是覺得我給這黑人開價太高
And if you all think my price for this nigger here is too steep,

1595
02:02:27,820 --> 02:02:30,427
那我的打算就是...
what I'm gonna desire to do is…

1596
02:02:33,550 --> 02:02:37,571
抄起我的錘子，活活砸死她！
take this fuckin' hammer here, and beat her ass to death with it!

1597
02:02:37,651 --> 02:02:39,187
就在你們倆面前！
Right in front of both y'all!

1598
02:02:39,201 --> 02:02:40,060
不錯吧，夥計們？
Ain't it good, fella?

1599
02:02:40,063 --> 02:02:44,451
然後我們就可以檢查檢查 布隆希達腦殼上的三個洞在哪了！
Then we can examine the three dimples inside Broomhilda skull!

1600
02:02:44,647 --> 02:02:45,910
現在！
Now!

1601
02:02:46,043 --> 02:02:48,332
你買還是不買呢，醫生？啊？
What's it gonna be, Doc? Huh?

1602
02:02:49,270 --> 02:02:50,169
買還是不買？
What's it gonna be?

1603
02:02:50,184 --> 02:02:53,784
我能不能把手拿起來一會兒 取身上的錢包？
May I lift the hands off the table top in order to remove my billfold?

1604
02:02:55,597 --> 02:02:56,719
請吧
Yes you may.

1605
02:03:10,578 --> 02:03:11,698
這是一萬二
That twelve.

1606
02:03:15,826 --> 02:03:17,245
成交！
Sold!

1607
02:03:17,957 --> 02:03:23,618
賣給這位可愛優秀的大鬍子， 以及他不怎麼優秀的黑鬼
To the man with the exceptional beard, and his unexceptional nigger.

1608
02:03:29,701 --> 02:03:31,724
- 摩吉先生 - 是的卡爾文？
Mr. Moguy. – Yes Calvin?

1609
02:03:32,738 --> 02:03:36,071
你給這位先生出個一萬二的收據吧
You make this gentleman a receipt for twelve thousand dollar, please.

1610
02:03:36,236 --> 02:03:39,054
- 一萬二啊 - 嗯
– Twelve thousand dollar. – Hm.

1611
02:03:41,074 --> 02:03:43,474
跟你們做生意真是太愉快了
It was a pleasure doin' business with ya all.

1612
02:03:44,046 --> 02:03:45,482
先生們...
Now gentlemen…

1613
02:03:46,834 --> 02:03:48,927
你們可以跟我一起來客廳
If you care to join me in the parlor…

1614
02:03:49,771 --> 02:03:52,074
我們還有蛋糕要吃
we will be serving white cake.

1615
02:05:20,445 --> 02:05:21,997
幹得漂亮，卡爾文
Well done, Calvin.

1616
02:05:24,815 --> 02:05:27,633
對不起...對不起，女士？
Excuse me… Excuse me, madam?

1617
02:05:28,821 --> 02:05:31,225
能不能不要彈貝多芬了？
Could you please stop playing Beethoven?

1618
02:05:31,269 --> 02:05:32,607
放開這豎琴！
Take your hands off that harp!

1619
02:05:36,993 --> 02:05:38,113
醫生！
Doctor!

1620
02:05:38,389 --> 02:05:40,988
- 醫生，你不能進那個房間！ - 嘿，斯蒂文
– Doc, you can't go in there! – Hey uh, Steven, hey!

1621
02:05:40,998 --> 02:05:43,011
- 他又沒什麼事要去那 - 讓他去吧
– He got no business goin' in there. – Let it be.

1622
02:05:43,806 --> 02:05:47,186
他只是有點不開心嘛，我來搞定
He's a little upset, that's all. I'll handle this.

1623
02:06:12,941 --> 02:06:14,061
白奶油蛋糕要不要？
White cake?

1624
02:06:15,204 --> 02:06:18,004
我不吃甜的，謝謝
I don't go in for sweets, thank you.

1625
02:06:27,530 --> 02:06:29,996
你還在為剛才的生意憂愁呢
You brooding 'bout me getting the best of ya, uh?

1626
02:06:30,911 --> 02:06:35,432
其實我剛才在想 你今天拿去餵狗的那個可憐人
Actually, I was thinking of that poor devil you fed to the dogs today.

1627
02:06:35,674 --> 02:06:37,026
達達尼昂
D'Artagnan.

1628
02:06:38,467 --> 02:06:41,427
我就想，大仲馬會怎麼看這件事
And I was wondering what Dumas would make of all this.

1629
02:06:42,251 --> 02:06:44,051
誰？
Come again?

1630
02:06:46,936 --> 02:06:50,785
亞歷山大·仲馬， 寫了《三個火槍手》的
Alexandre Dumas. He wrote “The Three Musketeers”.

1631
02:06:51,207 --> 02:06:52,918
哦是他啊
Yes of course, doctor.

1632
02:06:52,957 --> 02:06:54,703
我想你應該是他書迷
I figured you must be an admirer,

1633
02:06:54,713 --> 02:06:58,486
你的奴隸都是用書主角的名字命名
you named your slave after his novel's lead character.

1634
02:06:59,441 --> 02:07:03,059
如果大仲馬今天也在場
Now if Alexandre Dumas had been there today,

1635
02:07:03,110 --> 02:07:05,350
我在想他會怎麼看？
I wonder what he would have made of it?

1636
02:07:07,344 --> 02:07:08,990
你在懷疑他不會同意？
You doubt he'd approve?

1637
02:07:11,151 --> 02:07:16,180
是，他如果會同意，才令人起疑
Yes, his approval would be a dubious proposition at best.

1638
02:07:18,574 --> 02:07:20,347
法國人的心腸軟？
Soft hearted Frenchy?

1639
02:07:22,377 --> 02:07:24,377
大仲馬是黑人
Alexandre Dumas is black.

1640
02:07:28,469 --> 02:07:30,304
那些是布隆希達的文件嗎？
Are these Broomhilda's papers?

1641
02:07:30,414 --> 02:07:32,232
- 是的 - 我能看看嗎？
– Yes they are. – May I?

1642
02:07:32,365 --> 02:07:34,159
- 當然 - 謝謝
– Of course! – Thank you.

1643
02:07:36,863 --> 02:07:42,071
這份買賣文書當然也是 直接有還她自由身的效力的，醫生
I dealt- her bill of sale of ownership is written of course a freedom papers, doctor.

1644
02:07:42,291 --> 02:07:44,452
請問你有筆嗎？
Would you have ink and pen for me?

1645
02:07:45,653 --> 02:07:47,523
在那邊小桌子上
Right over there, on that little table.

1646
02:07:47,617 --> 02:07:49,017
謝謝
Thank you.

1647
02:08:09,888 --> 02:08:11,288
謝謝
Thank you.

1648
02:08:14,773 --> 02:08:16,593
布隆希達·范·夏夫特...
Broomhilda Von Shaft…

1649
02:08:19,084 --> 02:08:21,302
你現在自由了
consider yourself a free woman.

1650
02:08:33,500 --> 02:08:35,320
坎迪先生…
Mister Candy…

1651
02:08:37,248 --> 02:08:40,753
一般情況下我會說「再見了」，
Normally, I would say “auf wiedersehen”.

1652
02:08:41,480 --> 02:08:45,673
但「再見了」意思是說要再見面，
But since what “auf wiedersehen” actually means is “till I see you again”,

1653
02:08:46,370 --> 02:08:49,703
然後我的確不想再跟你見面了
and since I never wish to see you again, to you sir,

1654
02:08:50,133 --> 02:08:52,735
所以還是說「拜拜」吧
I say good bye.

1655
02:08:56,983 --> 02:08:58,383
我們走
Let's go.

1656
02:08:59,723 --> 02:09:00,843
走吧
Com'on.

1657
02:09:02,858 --> 02:09:05,258
等一等，醫生！
One more moment, Doctor!

1658
02:09:06,650 --> 02:09:07,726
嗯？
What?

1659
02:09:12,293 --> 02:09:14,470
這是南方的一個傳統
It's a custom here in the South,

1660
02:09:14,996 --> 02:09:18,165
一樁生意做完以後
once a business deal is concluded that the two parties…

1661
02:09:18,830 --> 02:09:20,541
雙方握手
shake hands.

1662
02:09:21,277 --> 02:09:22,664
代表著誠意
It implies good faith.

1663
02:09:23,474 --> 02:09:25,593
- 我又不是南方人 - 但是你...
– I'm not from the South. – But you are…

1664
02:09:26,592 --> 02:09:28,125
現在在我家呢
in my house doctor….

1665
02:09:29,711 --> 02:09:31,316
所以恐怕我要堅持這麼做了
so I'm afraid I must insist.

1666
02:09:31,589 --> 02:09:35,088
堅持？堅持什麼？讓我跟你握手？
Insist? On what? That I shake your hand?

1667
02:09:35,105 --> 02:09:38,235
哦那不好意思那我只能 堅持跟你相反的想法了
Oh, then I'm afraid I must insist in the opposite direction.

1668
02:09:38,940 --> 02:09:40,453
你覺得我怎麼看你的？
You know what I think you are?

1669
02:09:40,640 --> 02:09:43,640
你怎麼看我？不，不清楚
What you think I am? No I don't.

1670
02:09:45,490 --> 02:09:47,657
我覺得是個輸不起的傢伙
I think you are a bad loser.

1671
02:09:47,831 --> 02:09:50,831
我覺得你是個狂妄自大的贏家
And I think you're an abysmal winner.

1672
02:09:51,026 --> 02:09:52,539
是這樣…
Never the less…

1673
02:09:52,886 --> 02:09:55,781
在芝卡索縣，生意如此還不算做完
here in Chickasaw County, a deal ain't done

1674
02:09:56,110 --> 02:09:58,734
除非雙方最終握手
until the two parties have shook hands.

1675
02:09:59,375 --> 02:10:02,419
就算文書都簽了，那也不算數
Even after all that paper signin', don't mean shit…

1676
02:10:03,341 --> 02:10:06,385
如果你不跟我握手
you don't shake my hand.

1677
02:10:07,729 --> 02:10:10,664
如果我不跟你握手
If I don't shake your hand,

1678
02:10:10,859 --> 02:10:13,507
你就扔了那一萬二？
you're gonna throw away twelve thousand dollars?

1679
02:10:13,688 --> 02:10:15,787
我看不會吧
I don't think so.

1680
02:10:16,609 --> 02:10:18,289
布奇先生
Mr. Butch,

1681
02:10:19,657 --> 02:10:23,662
如果這個黑鬼愛好者德國佬不跟我握手 她就想離開這
if she tries to leave here before this nigger lovin' German shakes my hand,

1682
02:10:24,432 --> 02:10:26,592
把她打開花
you cut her ass down.

1683
02:10:48,171 --> 02:10:51,424
你真想我跟你握手？
You really want me to shake your hand?

1684
02:10:52,951 --> 02:10:54,511
我堅持
I insist.

1685
02:10:55,972 --> 02:10:58,222
如果真堅持的話
If you insist.

1686
02:11:16,453 --> 02:11:18,212
啊卡爾文！
Aaah Calvin!

1687
02:11:19,108 --> 02:11:21,206
卡爾文！
Caalvin!

1688
02:11:26,976 --> 02:11:29,432
對不起，我實在受不了了
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

1689
02:11:42,143 --> 02:11:44,078
這個黑鬼瘋了，該死...
The nigger's going crazy, the hell-

1690
02:11:44,727 --> 02:11:47,396
救命啊，他對每個人都開槍，啊！
Help, he's blowing everybody- Aaah!

1691
02:12:04,453 --> 02:12:06,575
該死！狗娘養的！
Shit! Son of a bitch!

1692
02:12:10,728 --> 02:12:11,848
去抓住他
Get that fuckin'…

1693
02:12:12,476 --> 02:12:13,596
去抓住他
Get that fuckin'-

1694
02:12:16,567 --> 02:12:21,182
該死的狗娘養的，操... 怎麼回事...該死！
Damn sonofabitch, what- what did the fuckin'- goddammit!

1695
02:12:22,846 --> 02:12:23,966
我操...
What the-

1696
02:12:25,672 --> 02:12:27,039
不要打我啊！
Don't strike me!

1697
02:12:27,132 --> 02:12:28,857
蠢材！
You stupid sonofabitch!

1698
02:12:28,928 --> 02:12:30,328
抱歉啊傑西！
Sorry Jessie!

1699
02:12:30,404 --> 02:12:34,995
誰他媽的給槍給這黑鬼的！
Who the fuck gave a nigger a goddamn gun!

1700
02:13:08,190 --> 02:13:10,515
黑鬼，來殺我啊
Nigger, com'on and kill-

1701
02:13:10,922 --> 02:13:14,169
啊！天哪！啊！
Aah! God! Ah my God, aah!

1702
02:13:14,289 --> 02:13:16,138
狗崽子！
Motherfucker!

1703
02:14:35,634 --> 02:14:37,454
停火！
Hold your fire!

1704
02:14:40,294 --> 02:14:42,114
停火！
Hold your fire!

1705
02:14:43,597 --> 02:14:45,697
不要打了，該死！
Stop shooting, goddammit!

1706
02:14:54,284 --> 02:14:55,404
姜戈！
Django!

1707
02:14:56,285 --> 02:14:57,405
什麼？
What?

1708
02:15:00,267 --> 02:15:02,087
你女人在我們手上！
We got your woman!

1709
02:15:03,273 --> 02:15:06,342
比利現在正拿著槍指著她腦袋！
Billy Crash here ha' got his pistol upside her hair!

1710
02:15:06,841 --> 02:15:08,880
你停止繼續抵抗，
You'll stop all that gettin'on,

1711
02:15:08,982 --> 02:15:11,518
他就不會把她腦袋打開花
he don't blow her goddamn brains out.

1712
02:15:11,693 --> 02:15:13,582
我們不是騙你的！
And that ain't no third holes, boy!

1713
02:15:14,535 --> 02:15:15,907
我保證
That there is a promise.

1714
02:15:17,509 --> 02:15:18,629
哦！
Oh oh!

1715
02:15:18,970 --> 02:15:20,090
你還不投降？
You ain't give up?

1716
02:15:20,546 --> 02:15:22,646
還想著逃走？
Thought you going, uh?

1717
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:24,080
我們會殺了你的！
We will kill you!

1718
02:15:24,450 --> 02:15:25,850
說什麼？！
How shit?!

1719
02:15:26,052 --> 02:15:28,776
老實說，別做那嘗試了，姜戈 我對天發誓
Honest, ain't lyin', Django, I swear o' all God.

1720
02:15:30,177 --> 02:15:31,297
你投降了？
You give up?

1721
02:15:32,151 --> 02:15:34,422
沒人會傷害你的
Ain't no harm gonna come t'you.

1722
02:15:36,306 --> 02:15:38,352
我現在還得相信你了？
And I'm supposed to believe your black ass?

1723
02:15:38,728 --> 02:15:41,858
對我來說，我才不管你信什麼不信什麼
Personal, I ain't give a good goddamn what you believe or don't believe!

1724
02:15:41,890 --> 02:15:44,965
我是覺得，如果你十秒鐘之內不投降
I believe, if you don't give up in the next ten seconds,

1725
02:15:44,979 --> 02:15:47,140
我們會把這婊子打到腦袋開花！ 信不信吧！
we gonna blow this bitch her brains out! Believe that!

1726
02:15:47,159 --> 02:15:48,968
信不信吧！
Believe that!

1727
02:15:53,184 --> 02:15:54,582
放棄我好了
You give me up.

1728
02:15:54,824 --> 02:15:55,527
六！
Six!

1729
02:15:55,551 --> 02:15:56,871
讓我去吧！
Just let me go!

1730
02:15:57,021 --> 02:15:57,769
七！
Seven!

1731
02:15:57,797 --> 02:15:59,271
- 我愛你太深 - 姜戈
– I take care too much. – Django.

1732
02:15:59,341 --> 02:16:00,195
八！
Eight!

1733
02:16:00,524 --> 02:16:01,924
我愛你
I love you.

1734
02:16:01,993 --> 02:16:03,113
九！
Nine!

1735
02:16:03,180 --> 02:16:04,888
- 等等！ - 不！
– Hold it! – No!

1736
02:16:07,279 --> 02:16:08,607
我投降
I give up.

1737
02:16:09,420 --> 02:16:11,562
我聽不清啊，黑鬼
I can't hear you, nigger.

1738
02:16:12,469 --> 02:16:14,547
我說，我投降！
I said: I give up!

1739
02:18:14,968 --> 02:18:16,793
吊著還舒服吧，黑鬼
Hock a litl'e doodle, nigger.

1740
02:18:22,496 --> 02:18:24,775
聽說你是個賞金獵手啊？
So y'all bounty hunters, huh?

1741
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:27,840
傳言還挺血腥的
I knew there was something fishy 'bout y'all.

1742
02:18:29,356 --> 02:18:34,025
我們找到了你的「通緝令」傳單， 馬鞍的袋子媮晹釩雃h畫像
We found your “wanted” posters… and book of figures in your saddle bags.

1743
02:18:35,762 --> 02:18:37,307
我得說...
I gotta say…

1744
02:18:38,115 --> 02:18:40,706
我以前還從沒聽說過有黑人賞金獵手呢
I ain't never heard of no black bounty hunter before.

1745
02:18:41,432 --> 02:18:44,742
黑人收錢殺白人啊，這工作感覺怎麼樣？
A black boy paid to kill white men, how d'you like that line of work?

1746
02:18:45,570 --> 02:18:48,370
做著感覺肯定很爽吧？
Prob'bly pretty good while it lasted, uh?

1747
02:18:57,983 --> 02:19:00,099
是時候跟你的蛋蛋說拜拜了，黑鬼
Time to say goodnight to them nuts, black.

1748
02:19:00,282 --> 02:19:01,365
數到三
On three…

1749
02:19:02,149 --> 02:19:03,248
一…
One…

1750
02:19:03,788 --> 02:19:04,756
我來
I got you.

1751
02:19:05,506 --> 02:19:06,692
二…
Two…

1752
02:19:06,973 --> 02:19:08,892
冷靜點黑鬼，冷靜
Calm down nigger, keep calm.

1753
02:19:10,033 --> 02:19:11,153
老大？
Cap't?

1754
02:19:11,640 --> 02:19:13,160
勞拉小姐在找你
Miss Lara wants to see you.

1755
02:19:14,265 --> 02:19:17,073
是跟葬禮有關的
That is somethin' to do with the Old Man's funeral.

1756
02:19:18,455 --> 02:19:21,922
哦，還有她不想閹掉姜戈了
Oh, and she changed her mind 'bout snippin' Django.

1757
02:19:23,079 --> 02:19:26,381
她要把他送去拉奎·迪基一家
She gonna give 'em to the LeQuint Dickey people.

1758
02:19:27,671 --> 02:19:30,231
那她怎麼沒跟我說啊
Well she didn't waste a minute tellin' me.

1759
02:19:37,010 --> 02:19:39,197
真掃興
How disappointing.

1760
02:20:01,815 --> 02:20:02,935
你和我
You n' me.

1761
02:20:04,907 --> 02:20:06,027
這些不是…
These ain't…

1762
02:20:06,453 --> 02:20:08,273
你帶來的東西
what you take with you.

1763
02:20:11,333 --> 02:20:14,854
大宅堬{在所有的人
Your black ass been all the motherfuckers' in that Big House

1764
02:20:14,909 --> 02:20:17,539
過去幾個小時全都在討論你
could talk about for the last few hours.

1765
02:20:18,446 --> 02:20:22,342
這些白人永遠也想不出個好點子
Seemed like white folk ain't never had a bright idea in their life,

1766
02:20:22,363 --> 02:20:24,803
要怎樣才能好好宰了你
was comin' up with all kinds o'ways to kill your ass.

1767
02:20:25,014 --> 02:20:30,621
不得不說的是，他們大多數 都打著你蛋蛋的主意
Now mind ya, most of 'dem ideas had to do with fuckin' with your fun parts.

1768
02:20:30,697 --> 02:20:35,999
這或許是個好主意，但其實...
Now, that may seem like a good idea, but truth is…

1769
02:20:37,669 --> 02:20:43,338
把蛋割了以後呢，大多數人都會流血死掉...
when you snip a nigger's nuts, most of 'em bleed out, know 'bout…

1770
02:20:43,612 --> 02:20:45,612
大多數人七分鐘就死了吧
seven minutes, most of 'em…

1771
02:20:47,992 --> 02:20:49,419
最多就是這樣
More than most.

1772
02:20:50,140 --> 02:20:51,739
然後我就說...
Then I say is…

1773
02:20:53,504 --> 02:20:55,340
該死的...
Hells bells…

1774
02:20:56,180 --> 02:21:00,174
我們賣去拉奎·迪基那邊的黑鬼 下場慘得多呢
the niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey, got it worse then that.

1775
02:21:01,244 --> 02:21:04,069
他們還在嚷嚷「我們用鞭子抽死他」
And they're still sayin' “Let's whip 'em to death”,

1776
02:21:04,145 --> 02:21:07,595
「讓他去打曼丁戈」「讓斯通瑟的狗咬死他」
“Dump 'em to the mandingos”, “Feed 'em to Stonesipher's dogs”.

1777
02:21:07,831 --> 02:21:12,891
我說「這有什麼很特別的？我們不是一直這樣嗎！」
And I say, “What's so special 'bout that? We do that shit all the time!

1778
02:21:13,048 --> 02:21:19,295
該死的，我們送去拉奎·迪基那堛熄簞 死得要慘得多啊
Hells bells, the niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey got it worse then that”.

1779
02:21:20,410 --> 02:21:27,136
誰知道就在這時， 勞拉小姐就有了這麼個想法
Low and behold, out of nowhere, miss Lara come up with the bright idea

1780
02:21:28,078 --> 02:21:32,739
要把你送去拉奎·迪基採礦公司
of givin' your ass to the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.

1781
02:21:34,170 --> 02:21:38,519
作為他們採礦公司的奴隸，
And as a slave of the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company,

1782
02:21:39,254 --> 02:21:42,783
我要說，直到你死掉的那天，
hence forth, till the day you die,

1783
02:21:43,010 --> 02:21:45,986
每天，從早到晚
all day, ev'ryday,

1784
02:21:46,236 --> 02:21:48,843
你會舉著大錘
you will be swingin' a sledgehammer,

1785
02:21:49,192 --> 02:21:53,272
把大石頭敲成小石頭
turning big rocks into little rocks.

1786
02:21:54,440 --> 02:21:58,680
等你到了那堙A你會被剝奪姓名
Now when you get there, they gonna take away your name,

1787
02:21:58,844 --> 02:22:01,599
只有個編號，還有個錘子
give you a number, and a sledgehammer,

1788
02:22:02,021 --> 02:22:03,857
告訴你「去幹活」
and say “get to work”.

1789
02:22:04,662 --> 02:22:07,112
多說半個字，舌頭就沒了
One word of says, they cuts out your tongue,

1790
02:22:07,187 --> 02:22:09,513
他們也挺擅長做那個的，很難相信吧
they's good at that too, you won't believe that.

1791
02:22:09,770 --> 02:22:12,043
他們也是為了你好啊
Ooh, they does that for you.

1792
02:22:13,502 --> 02:22:19,845
他們會讓你沒日沒夜地做工， 直到你站不起來
They gonna work you, all day, ev'ry day, till your back give up.

1793
02:22:20,407 --> 02:22:22,896
到那時他們就用錘子把你腦袋敲開花
Then they gonna hit you in the head with the hammer,

1794
02:22:23,039 --> 02:22:25,388
丟到黑奴的萬人坑堨h
tow your ass down the nigger hole.

1795
02:22:25,881 --> 02:22:31,175
那...就會是你的結局，姜戈
And that… will be the story end for you, Django.

1796
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:37,000
去拉奎·迪基採礦公司的路上

1797
02:23:19,896 --> 02:23:21,716
嘿，白人小哥
Hey, white boy…

1798
02:23:22,982 --> 02:23:24,802
我說，嘿，白人小哥！
I said: hey, white boy!

1799
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:27,906
閉嘴，黑鬼，你沒有什麼話是我想聽的
Shut up, black, you ain't got nothing to say I wanna hear.

1800
02:23:27,938 --> 02:23:30,647
你想不想掙個一萬一千塊？
How'd you like to make eleven thousand dollars?

1801
02:23:30,694 --> 02:23:31,980
我沒聽清？
D'you ain't hear?

1802
02:23:32,018 --> 02:23:34,766
我說，你想不想去掙一萬一千塊啊
I said, how d'you like to make eleven thousand dollars?

1803
02:23:35,722 --> 02:23:37,821
一萬一千五，具體說的話
Eleven thousand five hundred, actually.

1804
02:23:38,267 --> 02:23:40,235
你說什麼呢？
What the fuck are you talking about?

1805
02:23:40,306 --> 02:23:42,522
在那邊坎迪園農場
Back there at that plantation Candyland,

1806
02:23:42,676 --> 02:23:45,126
有一份一萬一千五的財產
there was an eleven thousand five hundred dollar fortune,

1807
02:23:45,148 --> 02:23:47,868

just sittin' there, and y'all rode right past it.

1808
02:23:48,510 --> 02:23:50,437
你真是該死啊黑鬼，我們可不是強盜
You be damned, blackie, we're not bandits.

1809
02:23:50,566 --> 02:23:53,446
我還沒說呢，這財寶最好的一點就是呢
I ain't sayin' that, nice thing 'bout this fortune it is.

1810
02:23:53,661 --> 02:23:56,104
不是什麼違法的事，你不用偷的
It ain't illegal, you can't steal it,

1811
02:23:57,003 --> 02:23:58,430
是去贏回來的，小哥
ya gotta earn it, white boy.

1812
02:23:59,133 --> 02:24:01,305
有什麼話就直說
You got something to say, mate, you say it.

1813
02:24:01,457 --> 02:24:04,738
坎迪園那一萬一千五的財產
The eleven thousand five hundred dollar fortune waiting for you back at Candyland,

史密蒂·巴考爾誰啊？
Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?

1817
02:24:11,393 --> 02:24:14,609

1818
02:24:14,784 --> 02:24:16,415
巴考爾黑幫

02:24:16,526 --> 02:24:19,533
他的腦袋值七千塊，不管死活
There's a seven thousand dollar wanted dead or alive bounty on him,

1820
02:24:19,800 --> 02:24:23,071

one thousand five hundred dollars for each of his three accomplices.

1821
02:24:23,274 --> 02:24:24,461
 丹迪·邁克爾斯

1822
02:24:25,227 --> 02:24:26,347
傑拉德·納什

還有瘋子克雷格·科恩斯

這四個人現在都在坎迪園

哈哈大笑呢，你知道為什麼嗎？
laughin' their ass off. You know why?

1826
02:24:34,876 --> 02:24:37,076
因為他們剛剛才保住小命
Cause they just got away with murder.

1827
02:24:37,342 --> 02:24:39,011
但事情不必如此發展
But it ain't got to be that way.

1828
02:24:39,085 --> 02:24:42,504
你和你的夥計們，就可以拿到這個錢了
You and your mate, young rabbit and Yango get that money.

1829
02:24:42,559 --> 02:24:43,856

Get it here.

1834
02:24:58,015 --> 02:25:03,255
通緝令，死活皆可... 史密蒂·巴考爾和他的團伙
Wanted dead or alive… Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall gang.

1835
02:25:03,301 --> 02:25:04,853
但你是個奴隸吧！
But you're a slave!

1836
02:25:05,143 --> 02:25:06,963
我才不是什麼奴隸！
I ain't no goddamn slave!

1837
02:25:07,533 --> 02:25:08,921
我聽上去像是奴隸嗎？
Do I sound like a fuckin' slave?

1838
02:25:08,976 --> 02:25:11,458
<i>- 懸賞七千塊... - 好大一筆錢啊</i>
<i>- 7000 dollars for Smitty Bacall… – This is a shit load!</i>

1839
02:25:11,638 --> 02:25:13,169
我是賞金獵手
I'm a bounty hunter.

1840
02:25:14,837 --> 02:25:19,293
昨天，我還是自由人，我去了坎迪園
Yesterday, as a free man, I rode in the Candyland,

1841
02:25:19,327 --> 02:25:23,549
騎著馬，跟我的德國白人同夥一起， 叫金·舒爾茲，是醫生
on a horse, with my German white partner, Dr. King Schultz.

1842
02:25:24,222 --> 02:25:28,727
我們一直從德州就追蹤巴考爾團伙 來到芝卡索縣
We tracked the Bacall gang all the way from Texas, to Chikasaw County.

1843
02:25:29,088 --> 02:25:31,742
終於發現他們在坎迪園躲著
We finally found their ass laying low at Candyland.

1844
02:25:32,102 --> 02:25:35,271
我們進去抓他們，但事情沒控制住
We went in there to get 'em, things went sour,

1845
02:25:35,670 --> 02:25:38,732
我的同夥被殺了，卡爾文·坎迪也中槍了
my partner got killed, Calvin Candie got shot.

1846
02:25:39,207 --> 02:25:43,157
所以堶悸漱H都怪到我頭上， 於是我就在這了
Then ev'rybody there decided to blame me, so here I am.

1847
02:25:45,447 --> 02:25:47,390
但姜戈可不是什麼奴隸
But Django ain't on that manifest,

1848
02:25:47,539 --> 02:25:50,200
你們也知道我不該在這
and all o'you know I ain't supposed to be on this trip.

1849
02:25:50,616 --> 02:25:53,566
但那四個人還在那堙A仍舊是通緝犯
But them four men are still back there, they're still wanted,

1850
02:25:54,062 --> 02:25:56,236
那一萬一千五還等著人領
and that eleven thousand five hundred is up for grabs,

1851
02:25:56,245 --> 02:25:59,202
他們最不希望看到的就是 你們回過頭去找他們
and the last thing they'd expect is y'all ridin' back and gittin' it.

1852
02:25:59,713 --> 02:26:01,533
你想說什麼？
What's the deal?

1853
02:26:02,055 --> 02:26:05,974
你告訴我們他們的身份... 然後我們給你鬆綁？
You tell us who they are and we… turn you lose?

1854
02:26:06,272 --> 02:26:08,372
我可沒告訴你們他們的身份
I ain't tellin' who they are.

1855
02:26:08,504 --> 02:26:11,738
聽著，你給我一把槍，一匹馬
Look, you give me a pistol, one o'them horses,

1856
02:26:11,993 --> 02:26:14,957
還有那一萬一千五里面的五百塊
and five hundred dollars of that eleven thousand five hundred,

1857
02:26:15,242 --> 02:26:16,652
我就指出他們給你們看
and I'll point 'em out to you.

1858
02:26:16,838 --> 02:26:18,173
這可真是一大筆錢啊
This a real handbill.

1859
02:26:18,567 --> 02:26:22,126
但這一大筆錢也不代表 我們可以相信他的大話吧
Ah jus'cause it's a real handbill's doesn't mean that other bunch o'malarky is.

1860
02:26:22,226 --> 02:26:28,239
那一個奴隸身上怎麼會有通緝令傳單？
Now why would a slave have a wanted dead or alive handbill in his pocket?

1861
02:26:32,846 --> 02:26:36,046
那個黑人昨天是騎著馬去了坎迪園嗎？
Ain't that black ridin' into Candyland yesterday?

1862
02:26:42,014 --> 02:26:43,097
好吧…
Alright…

1863
02:26:43,853 --> 02:26:45,878
我再問一遍…
I'm gonna ask you again…

1864
02:26:47,310 --> 02:26:49,613
你們得想清楚，我不喜歡騙子
I want you to remember I don't like liars.

1865
02:26:50,534 --> 02:26:55,930
他是坎迪園的奴隸嗎， 還是昨天跟著一個白人騎馬進去的？
Is he a Candyland slave, or did he ride in with a white man on horse yesterday?

1866
02:26:56,415 --> 02:26:57,535
是啊
Yeah.

1867
02:26:58,531 --> 02:27:00,656
他們帶我們從格林威爾拍賣會過來
They walked us from the Greenville Auction and

1868
02:27:00,657 --> 02:27:02,731
他和一個白人一起騎馬的
he rode in on a horse with a white man.

1869
02:27:03,659 --> 02:27:05,836
那這個白人…
And this white man…

1870
02:27:06,039 --> 02:27:07,667
這黑人是他奴隸？
was the black his slave?

1871
02:27:08,081 --> 02:27:09,635
他才不是奴隸
He weren't no slave.

1872
02:27:09,782 --> 02:27:11,675
你們...你們肯定？
You- you fuckin' sure about that?

1873
02:27:11,821 --> 02:27:13,221
非常肯定
Damn sure.

1874
02:27:17,504 --> 02:27:19,291
坎迪園都發生了什麼？
What happened over at Candyland?

1875
02:27:19,354 --> 02:27:20,408
各種槍戰…
Bunch of shootin'…

1876
02:27:21,033 --> 02:27:22,338
主人被槍擊
master got shot.

1877
02:27:23,018 --> 02:27:24,674
- 誰打的？ - 那個德國人
– Who shot 'em? – The German.

1878
02:27:25,164 --> 02:27:26,375
他幹嘛殺他？
Why did he do that?

1879
02:27:26,911 --> 02:27:30,403
這黑人還有那德國人假裝自己是買奴隸的， 但他們不是
The nigger and the German was actin' like they were slavers, but they weren't.

1880
02:27:30,724 --> 02:27:32,409
那他們是什麼人？
Well, what were they?

1881
02:27:32,586 --> 02:27:34,284
賞金獵手
Bounty hunters.

1882
02:27:35,098 --> 02:27:37,758
我操，羅伊，我覺得... 這可是大事啊！
Fuck me Roy, I mean this- this could be big, mate!

1883
02:27:39,174 --> 02:27:40,499
好吧黑哥兒們
Well, smoke…

1884
02:27:41,281 --> 02:27:42,679
成交
you gotta deal.

1885
02:27:43,941 --> 02:27:45,374
我還有個條件
I got one more condition.

1886
02:27:45,986 --> 02:27:46,923
什麼？
What is that?

1887
02:27:47,007 --> 02:27:49,864
我們到了以後...到了要殺人時候
When we get there… when the time come…

1888
02:27:52,184 --> 02:27:54,041
讓我幫忙一起殺
you let me help you kill 'em.

1889
02:27:55,331 --> 02:27:56,977
你還挺逗樂嘛！
You're a funny bugger!

1890
02:27:57,216 --> 02:27:58,992
- 給他鬆綁 - 好，好
– Get him loose. – Yeah, yeah.

1891
02:27:59,461 --> 02:28:01,482
我們一言為定了，黑哥
You got yourself a deal, blackie.

1892
02:28:01,607 --> 02:28:03,263
我們一言為定
You got yourself a deal, mate.

1893
02:28:05,577 --> 02:28:07,887
- 帶個黑哥兒們一起沒問題吧！ - 沒問題
– You alright for a black fella! – Oh yeah!

1894
02:28:09,934 --> 02:28:11,054
天哪…
Jeez…

1895
02:28:13,774 --> 02:28:16,224
好了...鬆綁了，老兄
There ya go… There ya go, mate.

1896
02:28:17,267 --> 02:28:19,667
我們給你那個背貨的馬
For you, we'll give you that pack horse over here.

1897
02:28:19,923 --> 02:28:21,860
馬鞍上都背了什麼？
What's them saddle bags got in?

1898
02:28:22,131 --> 02:28:23,235
炸藥
Dynamite.

1899
02:28:23,262 --> 02:28:26,142
我可不要騎有背著炸藥的馬
I ain't ridin' no horse with no goddamn dynamite on his back.

1900
02:28:26,247 --> 02:28:27,471
可以理解
I can understand that.

1901
02:28:28,284 --> 02:28:33,867
弗蘭基，把炸藥拿下來， 放到黑鬼的籠子堨h
Frankie, we take 'em sticks off that horse, and stick 'em in the nigger cage.

1902
02:28:35,118 --> 02:28:38,256
你們有炸藥可以玩咯！
A little dynamite for you black ass to play with!

1903
02:28:48,644 --> 02:28:51,393
弗洛伊德，你拿著馬車上那把獵槍的是吧？
Hey Floyd, you got that rifle on the wagon, don't you?

1904
02:28:51,424 --> 02:28:52,338
沒錯
Yeah, alright.

1905
02:28:52,479 --> 02:28:54,510
不用把你的槍和槍帶給他了
Don't you give 'em your gun and gun belt.

1906
02:28:56,789 --> 02:28:59,325
好了，拿好了別掉了
Now, don't drop the fucking thing, alright?

1907
02:28:59,873 --> 02:29:02,677
我才修好準星，現在很好用
I just had the sights fixed, and that perfect.

1908
02:29:02,964 --> 02:29:04,558
啊，多謝告知
Uh, that's good to know.

1909
02:30:36,672 --> 02:30:38,648
把炸藥給我
Throw me up that dynamite.

1910
02:32:08,842 --> 02:32:10,533
- 傑克？ - 嗯？
– Jake! – Yeah?

1911
02:32:10,558 --> 02:32:14,126
你得出去看看那該死的狗是怎麼了！
You gotta try to see what's goin'on with that goddamn dog!

1912
02:32:18,581 --> 02:32:20,438
下地獄吧，狗崽子們！
Go to hell, you motherfucker!

1913
02:33:50,262 --> 02:33:51,916
我也愛你
Love you too, son.

1914
02:34:52,137 --> 02:34:53,537
是我，寶貝
It's me, baby.

1915
02:35:41,842 --> 02:35:44,741
#在甜蜜的
?In the sweet…

1916

#告別聲中

#再見...再見...

1920
02:36:08,159 --> 02:36:12,610
#我們會留下...一句再見
?we will leave… we will leave byin' bye.

1921
02:36:12,626 --> 02:36:13,473
科拉
Cora,

1922
02:36:13,558 --> 02:36:15,758
能給我們煮點咖啡嗎？
would you prepare us some coffee?

1923
02:36:15,921 --> 02:36:17,715
西芭，你去幫忙
Sheba, you help her.

1924
02:36:17,781 --> 02:36:18,880
來吧
Come on.

1925
02:36:21,278 --> 02:36:24,078
#在甜蜜的
?In the sweet…

1926
02:36:24,408 --> 02:36:28,437
#告別聲中
– ?byin' bye, ooh…

1927
02:36:29,605 --> 02:36:32,891
你們會和卡爾文一起的說再見的
Ya'all gonna be together with Calvin and the byin bye.

1928
02:36:39,591 --> 02:36:41,940
不過要比你們想像的快一點啊
Just a bit sooner than ya'all was expectin'.

1929
02:36:50,289 --> 02:36:51,659
比利·可拉什！
Billy Crash!

1930
02:36:51,972 --> 02:36:53,727
你幹嘛要…?
Now why would…?

1931
02:36:53,946 --> 02:36:55,485
哦對了
Oh, that's right.

1932
02:36:56,525 --> 02:37:00,905
我們上次見面的時候， 你的手放在我的...
Last time I seen you, you had your hands on my…

1933
02:37:13,418 --> 02:37:14,856
姜戈！
Django!

1934
02:37:15,028 --> 02:37:17,080
你怎麼回來了，狗娘養的！
You back, sonofabitch!

1935
02:37:17,112 --> 02:37:18,314
這是給她親愛的比利的
To dear son, hey Billy.

1936
02:37:19,752 --> 02:37:20,872
噢不！
Oh no!

1937
02:37:22,771 --> 02:37:29,035
現在各位黑人，我建議你們離這些白人遠點
Now, all o'you black folks, I suggest you get away from all these white folks.

1938
02:37:30,230 --> 02:37:31,743
沒說你，斯蒂文
Not you Steven.

1939
02:37:32,598 --> 02:37:34,868
你給我原地好好站著
You're right where you belong.

1940
02:37:36,799 --> 02:37:38,361
科拉，你走之前…
Uh, Cora, before you go…

1941
02:37:38,838 --> 02:37:40,938
跟勞拉小姐道個別吧？
would you tell miss Lara goodbye?

1942
02:37:41,641 --> 02:37:42,749
干...幹嘛？
Do- do what now?

1943
02:37:43,031 --> 02:37:46,171
我說...跟勞拉小姐...道別
I said tell… miss Lara… goodbye.

1944
02:37:48,010 --> 02:37:48,892
再見了勞拉小姐
Bye miss Lara.

1945
02:37:54,011 --> 02:37:55,633
你們倆現在走吧
Ya'all two run along now.

1946
02:38:13,898 --> 02:38:15,018
斯蒂文！
Steve!

1947
02:38:15,485 --> 02:38:17,677
你覺得...我的新衣服怎麼樣？
How you like my… new dirt?

1948
02:38:19,024 --> 02:38:21,623
一小時之前我還不知道 勃艮第的顏色適合我呢
You know for an hour, I didn't know the burgundy was my color.

1949
02:38:33,256 --> 02:38:35,076
我數過你開了六槍了，黑鬼
I count six shots, nigger.

1950
02:38:36,816 --> 02:38:38,916
我帶了兩把槍，黑鬼
I count two guns, nigger.

1951
02:38:42,314 --> 02:38:46,686
你說在這農場的76年堙A 你見過任何種類的折磨是吧？
You said in 76 years on this plantation, you seen all o'manner shit done, ain'it?

1952
02:38:47,390 --> 02:38:48,997
但我也注意到…
But I noticed…

1953
02:38:49,184 --> 02:38:50,478
你的膝蓋骨不大好使啊
you didn't knit your knee cap.

1954
02:38:54,320 --> 02:38:55,845
76年啊，斯蒂文
Seventy six years, Steven…

1955
02:38:56,232 --> 02:38:59,300
來來往往的黑奴你見過多少個，七千？
how many niggers you think you see come n' go, uh, 7000…?

1956
02:39:00,214 --> 02:39:01,836
八千？
8000…?

1957
02:39:01,877 --> 02:39:03,174
九千？
9000…?

1958
02:39:03,804 --> 02:39:05,774
9999?
9999?

1959
02:39:06,441 --> 02:39:10,501
卡爾文·坎迪嘴埵R出每個字的都是狗屁
Ev'ry single word that came out of Calvin Candy's mouth was nothin' but cold shit.

1960
02:39:10,572 --> 02:39:12,266
但他有件事是說對了
But he was right 'bout one thing.

1961
02:39:12,454 --> 02:39:14,554
我就是那萬分之一
I am that one nigger in ten thousand.

1962
02:39:17,233 --> 02:39:19,402
你這狗崽子！
