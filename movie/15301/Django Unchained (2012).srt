Whoa.

31
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,971
Who's that stumblin'
around in the dark?

32
00:04:22,138 --> 00:04:25,934
State your business
or prepare to get winged!

33
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,686
Calm yourselves, gentlemen.

34
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:31,189
I mean you no harm.

35
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:36,194
I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
Whoa, boy.

36
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:39,197
Good cold evening, gentlemen.

37
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:41,699
I'm looking for a pair of slave traders

38
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:43,534
that go by the name
of the Speck Brothers.

39
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:45,536
Might that be you?

40
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:49,666
-Who wants to know?
-Well, I do.

41
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,709
I'm Dr. King Schultz.
This is my horse, Fritz.

42
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:56,464
-What kinda doctor?
-Dentist.

43
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:58,424
Now, are you the Speck Brothers?

44
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:01,386
And did you purchase those men
at the Greenville slave auction?

45
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:04,138
-So what?
-So I wish to parley with you.

46
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:07,642
-Speak English.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

47
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:10,019
Please forgive me.
It is a second language.

48
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:13,481
Now, amongst your inventory,
I've been led to believe,

49
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:16,067
is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.

50
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:17,694
Hello, you poor devils!

51
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:21,614
Is there one amongst you
who was formerly a resident

52
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:25,076
of the Carrucan plantation?

53
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:28,037
I'm from the Carrucan plantation.

54
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:31,040
Who said that?

55
00:06:18,254 --> 00:06:19,630
What's your name?

56
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:25,678
Django.

57
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:28,598
Then you are exactly
the one I'm looking for.

58
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:32,685
Do you know who
the Brittle Brothers are?

59
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:37,315
Who are they?

60
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:41,360
Big John.

61
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:43,488
Ellis.

62
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:48,826
Roger.
Sometime they call him Lil Raj.

63
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:52,413
They was overseers
at the Carrucan plantation.

64
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,664
Not anymore.

65
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:57,794
Tell me...

66
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:01,172
if you were to see
any of these three gentlemen again,

67
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:04,008
-would you recognize them?
-Hey.

68
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:06,636
-Stop talkin' to him like that.
-Like what?

69
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:08,346
Like that.

70
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:10,807
My good man,
I'm simply trying to ascertain...

71
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,017
Speak English, goddamn it.

72
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:14,936
Everybody calm down.

73
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:18,815
I'm simply a customer
trying to conduct a transaction.

74
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,984
I don't care. No sale.
Now, off with ya.

75
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:25,154
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course they're for sale.

76
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,448
Move it.

77
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:32,537
My good man, did you simply get carried
away with your dramatic gesture

78
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:36,499
or are you pointing your weapon at me
with lethal intention?

79
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,460
Last chance, fancy pants.

80
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,214
Oh, very well.

81
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:14,412
I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast,

82
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:16,497
but I didn't want you
to do anything rash

83
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:18,958
before you had a moment
to come to your senses.

84
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,545
You goddamn son of a bitch!

85
00:08:22,712 --> 00:08:25,506
-You shot Roscoe!
-Well...

86
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:27,383
And you killed Ace!

87
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,219
I only shot your brother once
he threatened to shoot me.

88
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:33,222
And I do believe I have...
one, two, three, four...

89
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:36,350
five witnesses
who can attest to that fact.

90
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,395
-Damn leg's busted!
-No doubt.

91
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:42,106
Now, if you could keep your
caterwauling down to a minimum,

92
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:45,610
I'd like to finish my line
of inquiry with young Django.

93
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:53,075
-God-fuckin'-damn it!
-As I was saying...

94
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:56,954
if you were to see the Brittle
Brothers again, you could recognize 'em?

95
00:08:57,622 --> 00:08:59,332
Yeah.

96
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:00,791
Sold American!

97
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,921
So, Mr. Speck? Mr. Speck?
How much for young Django here?

98
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:12,845
That iron is nasty business.

99
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:20,186
Oh, could you hold this for a moment?

100
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:23,814
Thank you. Django?

101
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:25,858
Get up on that horse.

102
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:27,818
Also, if I were you,

103
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:31,989
I'd take that winter coat
the dear departed Speck left behind.

104
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:50,007
Nigger!
Don't you touch my brother's coat.

105
00:10:00,685 --> 00:10:05,606
Goddamn it! Oh!

106
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:12,446
One hundred... ten... 20...

107
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,448
and five...

108
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,867
for young Django here.

109
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:19,203
And since he won't
be needing it anymore,

110
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,872
I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.

111
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:27,545
Also, Mr. Speck, I'm afraid
I will require a bill of sale.

112
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:29,297
Do you have one?

113
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:32,383
You go to hell, dentist.

114
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,552
I thought not.

115
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:38,222
No worries. I come prepared.

116
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,145
Thank you.

117
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:47,898
This will serve nicely
as a bill of sale.

118
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:01,245
Whoa.

119
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:08,878
Now, as to you poor devils.

120
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:14,091
So, as I see it, when it comes to
the subject of what to do next,

121
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:17,094
you gentlemen have two choices.

122
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:22,391
One: Once I'm gone, you could lift
that beast off the remaining Speck,

123
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:24,477
then carry him to the nearest town.

124
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:28,230
Which would be at least
37 miles back the way you came.

125
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:34,070
Or two: You could unshackle yourselves,
take that rifle,

126
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:36,781
put a bullet in his head,
bury the two of them deep,

127
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:40,493
and then make your way to a
more enlightened area of this country.

128
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:42,745
Choice is yours.

129
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:47,291
Oh, and on the off chance there are
any astronomy aficionados amongst you,

130
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,461
the North Star is that one.

131
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:55,091
Ta-ta.

132
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:13,984
Now wait a minute, fellas.
Let's talk about this!

133
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:21,033
You gotta be reasonable
in a situation like this!

134
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:25,496
I'm not a bad guy.
I'm just doin' my job!

135
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:29,250
Blueberry, didn't I
give you my last apple?

136
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:32,378
Tell you what, boys:
Take me to the doc in El Paso,

137
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:34,588
I'll get you your freedom.

138
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:38,509
No. No, please...

139
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:25,222
All right, now.

140
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:27,391
I'd like you to
take two of these tonight...

141
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:29,768
...and then in the morning...

142
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:33,689
That's a nigger on a horse.

143
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:01,091
What's everybody staring at?

144
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,761
They ain't never seen
no nigger on a horse before.

145
00:14:16,065 --> 00:14:17,066
Whoa.

146
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,119
Good morning, innkeeper!

147
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:32,915
Two beers for two weary travelers.

148
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:34,833
It's still a bit early.

149
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,419
We won't be open for another hour.

150
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,421
By then, we'll be servin' breakfast.

151
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:45,010
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... what
the hell you think you're doing, boy?

152
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:47,263
Get that nigger outta here!

153
00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:54,812
-Help! Help!
-Innkeeper!

154
00:14:54,979 --> 00:14:58,148
Remember, get the sheriff,
not the marshal.

155
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,192
Sheriff! Help!

156
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:01,986
Alas.

157
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:05,906
Now we must act as our own bartender.

158
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,077
Sit down, my boy.

159
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,631
What kind of dentist are you?

160
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:28,053
Despite that cart, I haven't
practiced dentistry in five years.

161
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:35,978
But these days,
I practice a new profession...

162
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,565
bounty hunter.

163
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:47,990
Do you know what a bounty hunter is?

164
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:49,742
No.

165
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,118
Well...

166
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:56,874
the way the slave trade
deals in human lives for cash,

167
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,376
a bounty hunter deals in corpses.

168
00:16:00,643 --> 00:16:01,754
Hat.

169
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,051
Prost.

170
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,895
The state places a bounty
on a man's head.

171
00:16:18,062 --> 00:16:20,731
I track that man, I find that man,
I kill that man.

172
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:24,860
After I've killed him, I transport that
man's corpse back to the authorities.

173
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:27,738
Sometimes that's easier said than done.

174
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,699
I show that corpse to the authorities,
proving yes, indeed,

175
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:32,576
I truly have killed him,

176
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:35,746
at which point the authorities
pay me the bounty.

177
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:39,249
So, like slavery,
it's a flesh for cash business.

178
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:41,877
What's a bounty?

179
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:47,132
It's like a reward.

180
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:50,678
You kill people?
And they give you a reward?

181
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,721
Certain people, yeah.

182
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:54,014
Bad people?

183
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:58,143
Ah! Badder they are,
bigger the reward.

184
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,604
Which brings me to you.

185
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:05,025
And I must admit, I'm at a bit of
a quandary when it comes to you.

186
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,611
On one hand, I despise slavery.

187
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:10,906
On the other hand, I need your help.

188
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:14,451
If you're not in a position to refuse,
all the better.

189
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:17,996
So, for the time being, I'm gonna
make this slavery malarkey

190
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:20,374
work to my benefit.

191
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:25,212
Still, having said that, I feel guilty.

192
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,136
So, I would like the two of us
to enter into an agreement.

193
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:41,019
I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.

194
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:47,025
However, at this endeavor,

195
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:52,322
I'm at a slight disadvantage insofar
as I don't know what they look like.

196
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:56,452
But you do. Don't ya?

197
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,829
I know what they look like all right.

198
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:02,499
Good. So here's my agreement.

199
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:06,086
-You travel with me until we find them.
-Where we goin'?

200
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,881
I hear at least two of them
are overseeing up in Gatlinburg,

201
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,216
but I don't know where.

202
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:15,679
That means we visit every plantation
in Gatlinburg till we find 'em.

203
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:21,101
And when we find them,
you point them out, and I kill them.

204
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:25,522
You do that, I agree
to give you your freedom,

205
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:29,818
$25 per Brittle Brother. That's $75.

206
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:33,697
And, as if on cue,
here comes the sheriff.

207
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:46,960
Okay, boys. Fun's over. Come on out.

208
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:54,176
All right, folks, calm down.

209
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:56,929
Go about your business.

210
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:00,098
These jokers will be gone soon.

211
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:07,481
Now, why y'all wanna come
into my town and start trouble?

212
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:10,901
And scare all these nice people.

213
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:14,738
You ain't got nothing better to do

214
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:18,116
than to come into Bill Sharp's town

215
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,536
and show your ass?

216
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:32,798
What'd you just do to our sheriff?

217
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:46,436
Now you can get the marshal.

218
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:50,274
Marshal! Marshal!

219
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,693
-Should we wait inside?
-Can we just leave?

220
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,069
After you.

221
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:00,742
Move that buckboard a long ways
across the street from the saloon.

222
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,787
I want six men, six rifles behind it.

223
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:06,123
I want two men,
two rifles up on this roof.

224
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,625
Two men, two rifles on that roof.

225
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:11,753
All the barrels aimed
at that front door.

226
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,923
Somebody get poor Bill
outta the goddamn street.

227
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:18,260
You in the saloon!

228
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:21,763
We got a hundred rifles aimed
at every way out of that buildin'.

229
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:25,642
You got one chance
to get out of this alive.

230
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,979
You and your nigger come out right now
with your hands over your head,

231
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:31,106
and I mean right now.

232
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:35,652
Is this the marshal
I have the pleasure of addressing?

233
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,613
Yes, it is.

234
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:39,865
This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.

235
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:42,326
<i>Na wunderbar</i>, marshal.

236
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:46,413
I have relieved myself of all weapons,

237
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,499
and just as you have instructed,

238
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,336
I am ready to step outside

239
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:56,590
with my hands raised above my head.

240
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,093
I trust as a representative

241
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,639
of the criminal justice system of
the United States of America,

242
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:09,645
I shan't be shot down in the street
by either you or your deputies

243
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:12,648
before I've had my day in court.

244
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,150
You mean like you did our sheriff.

245
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:17,110
Shot him down like a dog in the street.

246
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,613
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

247
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:25,452
Do I have your word as a lawman not to
shoot me down like a dog in the street?

248
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:32,042
Well, much as we'd all enjoy
seeing something like that,

249
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:35,212
ain't nobody gonna cheat
the hangman in my town.

250
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:39,216
Fair enough, marshal.
Here we come.

251
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:43,220
They're a little tense out there.

252
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:46,848
So don't make any quick movements,
and let me do the talking.

253
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:49,851
Come ahead.

254
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,151
You unarmed?

255
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,028
Yes, indeed we are.

256
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:04,116
Marshal Tatum, may I address you
and your deputies,

257
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,243
and apparently the
entire town of Daughtrey,

258
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,745
as to the incident that just occurred?

259
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,541
-Go on.
-Thank you.

260
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,835
My name is Dr. King Schultz.

261
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:18,255
Like yourself, marshal,
I'm a servant of the court.

262
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:21,842
The man lying dead in the dirt,
who the good people of Daughtrey

263
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:26,096
saw fit to elect as their sheriff,
who went by the name of Bill Sharp,

264
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:30,851
is actually a wanted outlaw
by the name of Willard Peck,

265
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:33,603
with a price on his head of $200.

266
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,732
Now that's $200, dead or alive.

267
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,233
The hell, you say!

268
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,446
I'm aware this is probably
disconcerting news.

269
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:45,782
But I'm willing to wager
this man was elected sheriff

270
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:48,452
sometime in the past two years?

271
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:50,370
Yeah.

272
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:53,957
I know this because three
years ago, he was rustling cattle

273
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:57,586
from the B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company
of Lubbock, Texas.

274
00:22:57,753 --> 00:23:01,548
Now, this is a warrant
made out by

275
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:07,387
Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen
Laudermilk of Austin, Texas.

276
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:09,264
You're encouraged to wire him.

277
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:14,478
He'll back up who I am and
who your dear departed sheriff was.

278
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:26,573
In other words, marshal,
you owe me $200.

279
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,604
I'll be damned.

280
00:23:36,604 --> 00:23:38,186
♪ <i>His name was King</i>

281
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:41,557
♪ <i>He had a horse</i>

282
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:46,696
♪ <i>Along the countryside</i>
♪ <i>I saw him ride</i>

283
00:23:46,957 --> 00:23:49,458
♪ <i>He had a gun</i>

284
00:23:49,582 --> 00:23:51,313
♪ <i>I knew him well</i>

285
00:23:51,586 --> 00:23:54,035
♪ <i>Oh, I heard him singing</i>

286
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:57,173
♪ <i>I knew he loved someone</i>

287
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,365
After this Brittle business
is behind us,

288
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:14,079
you'll be a free man, with a horse,
$75 in your back pocket...

289
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:18,291
What's your plan after that?

290
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:24,381
Find my wife, and buy her freedom.

291
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:31,513
Django, I had no idea
you were a married man.

292
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:34,307
Do most slaves believe in marriage?

293
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:38,061
Oh, me and my wife do.

294
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:42,399
Old Man Carrucan didn't.
That's why we, uh... we run off.

295
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:45,235
Django.

296
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:48,488
Django, Django.

297
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:51,366
You got sand, Django.

298
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:53,952
Boy's got sand.

299
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:58,874
I got no use for a nigger with sand.

300
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:04,087
I want you to burn a runaway "r"
right here on his cheek.

301
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:05,297
And the girl, too.

302
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:12,220
And I want you to take 'em to
the Greenville auction and sell 'em.

303
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:14,931
Both of 'em.

304
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:16,850
Separately.

305
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:20,645
And this one...

306
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:25,984
you will sell him cheap.

307
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:29,446
In Greenville...

308
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,951
there should be some sort
of a records office.

309
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:44,377
You know when she was sold...

310
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:48,798
you know where she came from,

311
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:50,800
and you know her name.

312
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:53,136
What is her name?

313
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:54,971
Broomhilda.

314
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:59,809
-What?
-Broom-hilda.

315
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:01,937
-Broomhilda?
-Hm-mm.

316
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:07,025
-Were her owners German?
-Yeah, how you know?

317
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:09,319
She wasn't born on
the Carrucan plantation.

318
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:12,030
She was raised by a German mistress,

320
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:16,243
-Your wife?
-Hm-mm.

321
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,245
When she was little, her mistress
taught her so she'd have somebody

322
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:19,996
to speak German with.

323
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:24,167
Well, let me get this straight.

324
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:28,922
Your slave wife speaks German
and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?

325
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:30,215
Yep.

326
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:37,013
They call me Hildi.

327
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:59,286
When we gain access to these
plantations, we'll be putting on an act.

328
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,373
You'll be playing a character.

329
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:11,381
Hm?

330
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,508
No?

331
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:24,978
During the act, you can
never break character.

332
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:27,605
Do you understand?

333
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:30,900
Yeah. Don't break character.

334
00:27:33,236 --> 00:27:37,157
And your character
is that of The Valet.

335
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:39,409
What that is?

336
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:42,704
That's a fancy word for servant.

337
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:44,122
-Valet?
-Hm-mm.

338
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:50,128
And now, Django, you may choose
your character's costume.

339
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:54,382
Youse gonna let me
pick out my own clothes?

340
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:55,508

Django is a free man.

389
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:48,681
He cannot be treated like a slave.
He... within the bounds of good taste,

390
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:51,351
he must be treated
as an extension of myself.

391
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:54,521
-Understood, Schultz. Betina, sugar?
-Yes'm?

392
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:59,317
Django isn't a slave.
Django is a free man, you understand?

393
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:02,820
You can't treat him like any
of the other niggers around here,

394
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:05,907
'cause he ain't like any of the
other niggers around here. You got it?

395
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:08,952
You want I should
treat him like white folks?

No. That's not what I said.

Big Daddy.

Yes, I can see that. Uh...

-Yes, I's free.

00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:19,447
Y'all wanna see somethin'?

474
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,619
No!

475
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:36,297
Who were they?

476
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:40,009
That's Big John,
and that's Lil Raj.

477
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:41,677
Where's Ellis?

478
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:44,180
He's the one hightailin' it
across that field right now.

479
00:37:49,018 --> 00:37:50,519
-You sure that's him?
-Yeah.

480
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:52,605
-Positive?
-I don't know.

481
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:55,024
-You don't know if you're positive?
-I don't know what "positive" mean.

482
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:56,442
-It means you're sure.
-Yes.

483
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:58,903
-"Yes," what?
-Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.

484
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:13,709
I'm positive he dead.

485
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:19,757
Django!

486
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,970
Everybody calm down.

487
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:26,389
We mean no one else any harm.

488
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:28,099
Who are you two jokers?

489
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:31,268
I am Dr. King Schultz,
a legal representative

490
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:34,105
of the criminal justice system of
the United States of America.

491
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:38,859
The man to my left is Django Freeman.
He's my deputy.

492
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:40,987
In my pocket is a warrant,

493
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:45,241
signed by Circuit Court Judge
Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas,

494
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:49,286
for the arrest and capture,
dead or alive,

495
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:54,458
of John Brittle,
Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle.

496
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,711
They were goin' by the name Shaffer.

497
00:38:58,129 --> 00:39:02,258
You know them by the name of Shaffer,
but the butchers' real name was Brittle.

498
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:04,093
These are wanted men.

499
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,720
The law wants 'em for murder.

500
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:10,016
Now, I reiterate, the warrant
states dead or alive,

501
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:13,477
so when Mr. Freeman and myself
executed these men on sight,

502
00:39:13,644 --> 00:39:17,106
we were operating
within our legal boundaries.

503
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:22,611
I realize passions are high,

504
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:26,824
but I must warn you,
the penalty for taking deadly force

505
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:29,368
against an officer of the court
in the performance of his duty

506
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:33,456
is you'll be hung by the neck
until you're dead.

507
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:41,213
Now, may I please remove the warrant
from my pocket so you may examine it?

508
00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:44,425
Gimme.

509
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:02,318
Satisfied?

510
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:11,118
May I have that back, please?

511
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:19,835
-Get off my land.
-Posthaste.

512
00:40:20,503 --> 00:40:24,924
Load up the bodies as quickly as you can
and let's get outta here.

513
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:54,286
Yeah, that's them sons-a-bitches.

514
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:35,578
Come on, men!

515
00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:41,292
-We're coming for you, nigger!
-Hee-haw!

516
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:54,930
Now, unless they start shootin' first,
nobody shoot 'em.

517
00:41:55,097 --> 00:41:57,308
That's way too simple for these jokers.

518
00:41:58,058 --> 00:42:00,686
We're gonna whup that
nigger-lover to death.

519
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:05,900
And I'm gonna personally
strip and clip that garboon myself.

520
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:10,988
Damn.

521
00:42:12,323 --> 00:42:14,950
I can't see fuckin' shit
outta this thing.

522
00:42:15,868 --> 00:42:17,161
We ready or what?

523
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:19,705
Aw, hold on,
I'm fuckin' with my eyeholes.

524
00:42:19,872 --> 00:42:22,249
Oh... Oh, shit.

525
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:24,627
I just made it worse.

526
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:26,837
Who made this goddamn shit?

527
00:42:27,004 --> 00:42:29,965
-Willard's wife.
-Well, make your own goddamn masks!

528
00:42:30,132 --> 00:42:33,719
Look, nobody's sayin'
they don't appreciate what Jenny did.

529
00:42:33,886 --> 00:42:36,472
Well, if all I had to do
was cut a hole in a bag,

530
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:38,307
I coulda cut it better than this!

531
00:42:38,474 --> 00:42:41,268
What about you, Robert?
Can you see?

532
00:42:41,435 --> 00:42:42,645
Not too good.

533
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:47,149
I mean, if I don't move my head I can
see you pretty good, more or less.

534
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:50,819
But when I start ridin', the bag's
movin' all over, and I'm ridin' blind.

535
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:53,072
-Shit.
-Yeah.

536
00:42:53,614 --> 00:42:55,282
I just made mine worse.

537
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:57,243
Oh, God.

538
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:58,953
Anybody bring any extra bags?

539
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,081
No, nobody brought an extra bag!

540
00:43:02,248 --> 00:43:03,874
I'm just askin'.

541
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:05,834
Do we have to wear 'em when we ride?

542
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:07,211
Oh, well, shitfire!

543
00:43:07,378 --> 00:43:10,464
If you don't wear 'em as you ride up,
that just defeats the purpose!

544
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:12,591
Well, I can't see
in this fuckin' thing!

545
00:43:12,758 --> 00:43:15,469
I can't breathe in this fuckin' thing
and I can't ride in this fuckin' thing!

546
00:43:15,636 --> 00:43:18,055
Well, fuck all y'all! I'm goin' home!

547
00:43:18,222 --> 00:43:22,017
Now, I watched my wife work all day
gettin' 30 bags together

548
00:43:22,184 --> 00:43:24,186
for you ungrateful sons-a-bitches,

549
00:43:24,353 --> 00:43:28,107
and all I can hear is
criticize, criticize, criticize!

550
00:43:28,274 --> 00:43:31,443
From now on, don't ask me
or mine for nothin'!

551
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:35,614
Now, look, let's not forget
why we're here.

552
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:38,867
We got a killer nigger
over that hill there!

553
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:40,369
And we gotta make a lesson out of him.

554
00:43:40,536 --> 00:43:44,373
Okay, I'm confused.
Are the bags on or off?

555
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:49,336
I think, we all think
the bag was a nice idea.

556
00:43:49,503 --> 00:43:50,462
Yeah.

557
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:54,717
But not pointin' any fingers,
they coulda been done better.

558
00:43:55,676 --> 00:43:59,388
So how 'bout no bags this time,

559
00:43:59,555 --> 00:44:04,560
but next time we do the bags right
and then we go full regalia.

560
00:44:04,727 --> 00:44:06,729
-I like that idea a lot.
-You get my vote, Robert.

561
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:10,232
Wait a minute!
I didn't say no bags.

562
00:44:10,399 --> 00:44:12,401
But nobody can see.

563
00:44:12,568 --> 00:44:13,652
So?

564
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:15,696
So it'd be nice to see.

565
00:44:15,863 --> 00:44:20,617
Goddamn it! This is a raid!
I can't see, you can't see!

566
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:26,165
So what? All that matters is can
the fuckin' horse see! That's a raid!

567
00:44:26,332 --> 00:44:29,126
Sons of bitches!

568
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:31,628
I can't see shit!

569
00:44:31,795 --> 00:44:35,424
There he is! Get that nigger
out from under that wagon!

570
00:44:36,258 --> 00:44:38,260
And get that nigger-lover
outta the wagon!

571
00:44:38,427 --> 00:44:40,054
That nigger ain't down here,
Big Daddy!

572
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,638
-What?
-They tricked us!

573
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:42,848
Well, where are they?

574
00:44:43,015 --> 00:44:44,433
<i>Auf Wiedersehen</i>.

575
00:44:50,147 --> 00:44:51,940
Oh!

576
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:53,150
Bull's-eye.

577
00:44:56,153 --> 00:44:59,448
Look at 'em run.

578
00:45:02,076 --> 00:45:04,661
Yeah, cowards tend to do that.

579
00:45:04,828 --> 00:45:06,789
Goddamn it!

580
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,171
Goddamn it!

581
00:45:18,801 --> 00:45:20,511
Would you care to?

582
00:45:27,309 --> 00:45:29,144
Can't see shit outta this!

583
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:31,939
-He's getting away.
-I got him.

584
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:35,442
Big Daddy's getting away.

585
00:45:35,609 --> 00:45:36,860
I got him.

586
00:45:52,126 --> 00:45:53,168
Got him.

587
00:45:58,006 --> 00:46:01,009
The kid's a natural.

588
00:46:11,687 --> 00:46:15,482
How you know Broomhilda's
first masters was German?

589
00:46:15,649 --> 00:46:17,901
Broomhilda is a German name.

590
00:46:18,068 --> 00:46:20,779
If they named her,
it stands to reason they'd be German.

591
00:46:20,946 --> 00:46:23,198
Lots of gals where you're from
named Broomhilda?

592
00:46:23,991 --> 00:46:26,952
Broomhilda is the name of a character

593
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,039
in the most popular
of all the German legends.

594
00:46:31,206 --> 00:46:33,167
There's a story about Broomhilda?

595
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:35,043
Oh, yes, there is.

596
00:46:41,091 --> 00:46:44,553
-Do you know it?
-Oh, every German knows that story.

597
00:46:50,976 --> 00:46:52,352
Would you like me to tell you?

598
00:46:53,854 --> 00:46:59,860
Well, Broomhilda was a princess.

599
00:47:01,695 --> 00:47:05,782
She was a daughter of Wotan,
god of all gods.

600
00:47:06,825 --> 00:47:10,037
Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

601
00:47:10,204 --> 00:47:11,455
What she do?

602
00:47:12,414 --> 00:47:13,874
I can't exactly remember.

603
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:16,710
She disobeys him in some way.

604
00:47:16,877 --> 00:47:20,047
So he puts her on top of the mountain.

605
00:47:20,714 --> 00:47:21,840
Broomhilda's on a mountain?

606
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:23,258
It's a German legend,

607
00:47:23,425 --> 00:47:26,220
there's always going to be
a mountain in there somewhere.

608
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:30,432
And he puts a fire-breathing dragon
there to guard the mountain.

609
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:37,189
And he surrounds her
in a circle of hellfire.

610
00:47:38,649 --> 00:47:42,986
And there, Broomhilda shall remain.

611
00:47:44,279 --> 00:47:49,576
Unless a hero arises
brave enough to save her.

612
00:47:50,661 --> 00:47:52,246
Does a fella arise?

613
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:55,374
Yes, Django, as a matter of fact,
he does.

614
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:57,584
A fella named Siegfried.

615
00:47:58,293 --> 00:47:59,294
Does Siegfried save her?

616
00:48:01,463 --> 00:48:04,091
Quite spectacularly so.

617
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:09,263
He scales the mountain,
because he's not afraid of it.

618
00:48:09,972 --> 00:48:14,142
He slays the dragon,
because he's not afraid of him.

619
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:16,812
And he walks through hellfire...

620
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:21,525
because Broomhilda's worth it.

621
00:48:25,654 --> 00:48:27,322
I know how he feel.

622
00:48:28,782 --> 00:48:31,660
I think I'm just
starting to realize that.

623
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:41,336
Now, look, Django...

624
00:48:44,256 --> 00:48:48,302
I don't doubt that one day
you'll save your lady love...

625
00:48:49,428 --> 00:48:53,015
but I can't let you go to
Greenville in a good conscience.

626
00:48:54,057 --> 00:48:58,520
A slave auction town in Mississippi
isn't the place for you to visit.

627
00:48:58,687 --> 00:49:01,565
Free or not, it's just too dangerous.

628
00:49:04,526 --> 00:49:06,695
But let me ask you a question.

629
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:16,622
How do you like the
bounty hunting business?

630
00:49:18,123 --> 00:49:20,459
Kill white folks
and they pay you for it?

631
00:49:21,293 --> 00:49:22,628
What's not to like?

632
00:49:22,794 --> 00:49:25,213
Now, I have to admit,
we make a good team.

633
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:28,216
I thought you was mad at me
for killin' Big John and Lil Raj.

634
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:30,469
Yeah, on that occasion
you were a tad overzealous,

635
00:49:30,636 --> 00:49:32,596
but normally, that's a good thing.

636
00:49:33,388 --> 00:49:35,599
How'd you like to partner up
for the winter?

637
00:49:35,766 --> 00:49:37,768
What you mean "partner up"?

638
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:42,230
You work with me through the winter
till the snow melts...

639
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:45,233
I give you a third of my bounties.

640
00:49:46,443 --> 00:49:50,364
So we make some money this winter,
and when the snow melts,

641
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:53,450
I'll take you to Greenville myself

642
00:49:53,617 --> 00:49:56,828
and we'll find
where they sent your wife.

643
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:02,834
Why you care what happen to me?

644
00:50:04,586 --> 00:50:06,546
Why you care if I find my wife?

645
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:08,090
Frankly...

646
00:50:09,383 --> 00:50:12,260
I've never given anybody
their freedom before.

647
00:50:12,427 --> 00:50:16,264
And now that I have,
I feel vaguely responsible for you.

648
00:50:17,516 --> 00:50:21,228
Plus, when a German meets a real life
Siegfried, that's kind of a big deal.

649
00:50:23,772 --> 00:50:26,650
As a German, I'm obliged
to help you on your quest

650
00:50:26,817 --> 00:50:29,444
to rescue your beloved Broomhilda.

Ooh. What happened to Mr. "I Wanna
Shoot White Folks For Money"?

671
00:52:51,628 --> 00:52:54,339
-His son's with him.
-Well, good.

672
00:52:54,506 --> 00:52:56,091
He'll have a loved one with him.

673
00:52:56,258 --> 00:52:58,760
Maybe even share a last word.

674
00:53:00,762 --> 00:53:02,806
That's better than most of them get.

675
00:53:02,973 --> 00:53:05,267
Damn sight better than he deserves.

676
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:14,776
Put down the rifle.

677
00:53:17,779 --> 00:53:19,489
Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.

678
00:53:20,282 --> 00:53:22,617
Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.

679
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:28,081
Read it aloud.

680
00:53:28,957 --> 00:53:30,750
Consider that today's lesson.

681
00:53:33,169 --> 00:53:35,839
"Wanted. Dead or alive."

682
00:53:36,798 --> 00:53:40,719
"Smitty Bacall and the
Smitty Bacall

683
00:53:40,886 --> 00:53:43,138
-Gang.
-Gang."

684
00:53:43,305 --> 00:53:46,975
"For murder and stagecoach...

-Seven-zero-zero-zero..."
-Seven thousand.

687
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:54,399
Thousand.

688
00:53:54,566 --> 00:53:58,778
"$7,000 for Smitty Bacall.

689

Gang are as follas:"

"Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash and..."

695
00:54:21,301 --> 00:54:23,219
Crazy Craig Koons.

696
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:26,473
That is who Smitty Bacall is.

697
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,517
If Smitty Bacall wanted
to start a farm at 22,

698
00:54:29,684 --> 00:54:31,645
they would never have printed that.

699
00:54:32,354 --> 00:54:35,774
But Smitty Bacall
wanted to rob stagecoaches

700
00:54:35,941 --> 00:54:38,360
and he didn't mind
killing people to do it.

701
00:54:39,027 --> 00:54:42,364
Do you want to save your wife
by doing what I do?

702
00:54:43,615 --> 00:54:45,075
This is what I do.

703
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:48,787
I kill people and
sell their corpses for cash.

704
00:54:49,704 --> 00:54:53,500
This corpse is worth $7,000.

705
00:54:53,667 --> 00:54:55,877
Now quit your pussyfooting
and shoot him.

706
00:55:06,012 --> 00:55:07,389
Pa?

707
00:55:07,555 --> 00:55:08,890
Pa!

708
00:55:17,357 --> 00:55:19,067
Here.

709
00:55:19,234 --> 00:55:21,319
You need to keep this
Smitty Bacall handbill.

710
00:55:21,486 --> 00:55:23,571
-Why?
-It's good luck.

711
00:55:23,738 --> 00:55:26,533
You always keep the handbill
of your first bounty.

712
00:56:14,456 --> 00:56:15,874
That's accurate.

713
00:57:24,192 --> 00:57:27,320
Doctor, Django, how the hell are ya?

714
00:57:28,363 --> 00:57:30,532
Who the hell-a you got there?

715
00:57:30,698 --> 00:57:32,659
The Wilson-Lowe Gang.

716
00:57:32,826 --> 00:57:35,829
Who the hell is the Wilson-Lowe Gang?

717
00:57:36,538 --> 00:57:41,084
Bad Chuck Wilson and meaner
Bobby Lowe and three of their acolytes.

718
00:57:41,251 --> 00:57:44,879
Huh. Well, just leave 'em out here,
they ain't going nowhere.

719
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:47,423
Why don't you come in then
out of the snowy snow

720
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:49,425
and get yourselves some coffee.

721
00:57:49,592 --> 00:57:52,137
We had a birthday yesterday.
Got some cake.

722
00:57:52,303 --> 00:57:53,721
Pretty good.

723
00:58:15,869 --> 00:58:18,204
Move along!

724
00:58:23,543 --> 00:58:25,628
Move it, boy!

725
00:58:27,172 --> 00:58:28,423
Keep movin'.

726
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:30,550
Get on up on that auction block.

727
00:58:32,093 --> 00:58:34,470
Don't let that mud slow you down.
Keep going.

728
00:58:50,904 --> 00:58:52,155
Keep goin'!

729
00:58:54,616 --> 00:58:58,536
"Broomhilda Von Shaft. Age 27.

730
00:58:58,703 --> 00:59:00,121
'r' on right cheek."

731
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:04,042
Calvin Candie.

732
00:59:04,209 --> 00:59:08,630
He owns the fourth biggest cotton
plantation in Mississippi: Candyland.

733
00:59:08,796 --> 00:59:10,131
Candyland?

734
00:59:10,298 --> 00:59:11,382
Oh, so you've heard of it.

735
00:59:11,549 --> 00:59:13,635
Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.

736
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:16,471
Well, apparently,
that's where your wife is...

737
00:59:16,638 --> 00:59:18,306
...and that's the repellant gentleman

738
00:59:18,473 --> 00:59:22,018
who owns her. Let's just hope she
works in the house, not in the field.

739
00:59:22,185 --> 00:59:24,312
Oh, no, she ain't no field nigger.

740
00:59:24,479 --> 00:59:26,481
She... she pretty.

741
00:59:27,148 --> 00:59:29,067
And she talk good, too.

742
00:59:30,652 --> 00:59:32,445
But when they tore her back up
and then they...

743
00:59:33,655 --> 00:59:35,823
burned that runaway "r"
on her cheek...

744
00:59:37,242 --> 00:59:38,409
they goddamned her.

745
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:44,499
She ain't no field nigger
but she ain't good enough

746
00:59:44,666 --> 00:59:46,668
for the house no more either.

747
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:48,127
They gonna try to
make her a comfort girl.

748
00:59:48,294 --> 00:59:50,171
What's a comfort...? Oh.

749
00:59:51,089 --> 00:59:52,382
Not while I got freedom.

750
00:59:53,967 --> 00:59:55,760
Not while I got my gun.

751
00:59:58,846 --> 01:00:00,556
So do we offer to buy her?

752
01:00:03,184 --> 01:00:04,560
So...

753
01:00:06,145 --> 01:00:07,814
say...

754
01:00:09,983 --> 01:00:13,194
a man wants to buy a horse.

755
01:00:13,361 --> 01:00:15,405
Needs to buy a horse.

756
01:00:16,364 --> 01:00:19,325
He walks up to the farmer's farm,
and he knocks on the farmer's door

757
01:00:19,492 --> 01:00:21,160
and asks the farmer to buy his horse.

758
01:00:21,327 --> 01:00:23,121
And do you know what the farmer says?

759
01:00:23,288 --> 01:00:25,498
The farmer says no.

760
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,963
Well, I say fuck that farmer,
and I'm stealin' that horse.

761
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:36,259
Fair enough. But now you're a horse
thief, and they hang horse thieves.

762
01:00:36,426 --> 01:00:38,553
Not to mention the horse
goes back to its original owner

763
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,346
because the horse is still his property.

764
01:00:40,513 --> 01:00:44,392
We need her and we need a bill of sale.

765
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:46,853
Well, if we ain't gonna try to buy her,
then how we gonna get her?

766
01:00:47,937 --> 01:00:51,524
May I offer an alternative
plan of action?

767
01:00:51,691 --> 01:00:53,192
Go ahead.

768
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:57,905
So... the man walks up
to the farmer's farm,

769
01:00:58,072 --> 01:00:59,615
he knocks on the farmer's door...

770
01:01:00,325 --> 01:01:05,371
and asks not to buy the horse,
but the farm.

771
01:01:05,538 --> 01:01:08,916
And makes an offer so ridiculous,

772
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:11,878
the farmer is forced to say yes.

773
01:01:12,754 --> 01:01:15,506
-We gonna offer to buy Candyland?
-No, it's far too big.

774
01:01:15,673 --> 01:01:18,926
But apparently this farmer
ain't all about the farm.

775
01:01:20,386 --> 01:01:22,430
How much do you know
about Mandingo fighting?

776
01:01:22,597 --> 01:01:23,598
What?

777
01:01:23,765 --> 01:01:26,601
Can you convincingly
masquerade as someone

778
01:01:26,768 --> 01:01:28,436
who is an expert on Mandingo fighting?

779
01:01:28,603 --> 01:01:29,645
Why?

780
01:01:29,812 --> 01:01:33,441
Because my character is that
of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf,

781
01:01:33,608 --> 01:01:37,028
here in Greenville to buy my way
into the Mandingo fight game.

782
01:01:37,195 --> 01:01:41,115
And your character is a Mandingo expert
I hired to help me do it.

783
01:01:41,282 --> 01:01:43,242
They call that "One-Eyed Charley."

784
01:01:46,329 --> 01:01:47,789
<i>Bonjour.</i>

785
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:53,795
We're here to see Mr. Calvin Candie.

786
01:01:53,961 --> 01:01:55,546
<i>Entraz.</i>

787
01:01:58,049 --> 01:01:59,509
-Thank you.
-Hm-mm.

788
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:03,179
You want me to play a black slaver?

789
01:02:03,346 --> 01:02:06,015
Ain't nothin' lower than a black slaver.

790
01:02:06,182 --> 01:02:09,644
A black slaver is lower
than the head house nigger...

791
01:02:10,311 --> 01:02:12,438
and, buddy,
that's pretty fuckin' low.

792
01:02:13,564 --> 01:02:15,566
Then play him that way.

793
01:02:15,733 --> 01:02:19,779
Give me your black slaver.

794
01:02:22,448 --> 01:02:27,412
<i>♪ Along came the 219
Toot! Toot! Peanut butter!</i>

795
01:02:31,165 --> 01:02:33,042
Dr. Schultz!

796
01:02:33,209 --> 01:02:36,421
-Good to see you again!
-Mr. Moguy.

797
01:02:36,587 --> 01:02:39,382
Thank you for your assistance
in creating the opportunity

798
01:02:39,549 --> 01:02:42,343
-for this appointment.
-Nonsense, it's my job.

799
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:45,346
So this is the One-Eyed Charley
I've heard so much about.

800
01:02:45,513 --> 01:02:47,932
Yes, this is Django Freeman.

801
01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:50,768
Django, this is Mr. Candie's lawyer,
Leonide Moguy.

802
01:02:50,935 --> 01:02:52,895
Just call me Leo.

803
01:02:53,062 --> 01:02:56,232
Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room.
You all wanna follow me?

804
01:02:56,399 --> 01:02:58,693
How long have you been
associated with Mr. Candie?

805
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:01,320
Oh, Calvin's father and I
were about 11

806
01:03:01,487 --> 01:03:03,281
when we went to
boarding school together.

807
01:03:03,448 --> 01:03:06,534
Calvin's father's father
put me through law school.

808
01:03:06,701 --> 01:03:09,704
One could almost say
I was raised to be Calvin's lawyer.

809
01:03:09,871 --> 01:03:11,622
One could almost say youse a nigger.

810
01:03:12,498 --> 01:03:13,916
What did you say?

811
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:16,836
-I said...
-Nothing, he's just being cheeky.

812
01:03:17,378 --> 01:03:21,799
Uh, anything else about Mr. Candie
that I should know before I meet him?

813
01:03:21,966 --> 01:03:23,968
Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.

814
01:03:24,135 --> 01:03:25,928
What civilized people aren't?

815
01:03:26,095 --> 01:03:28,347
And he prefers Monsieur Candie
to Mr. Candie.

816
01:03:31,142 --> 01:03:35,146
He doesn't speak French. Don't speak
French to him, it'll embarrass him.

817
01:03:38,065 --> 01:03:40,318
Get back on top, now!
Turn around!

818
01:03:40,485 --> 01:03:41,986
There you go.

819
01:03:42,153 --> 01:03:43,779
There you go.

820
01:03:45,656 --> 01:03:47,909
Why do you want to get in
the Mandingo business?

821
01:03:50,745 --> 01:03:54,499
You don't intend to allow your second
to make the proper introductions?

822
01:03:55,249 --> 01:03:57,126
Quit stalling, now.

823
01:03:57,293 --> 01:03:58,628
Answer the question.

824
01:04:01,297 --> 01:04:04,717
The awful truth? I'm bored.

825
01:04:04,884 --> 01:04:07,261
This seems like a good bit of fun.

826
01:04:12,183 --> 01:04:14,185
Well, come on over.

827
01:04:14,352 --> 01:04:17,063
We got us a fight goin' on
that's a good bit of fun.

828
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:22,568
Won't you accompany me to the bar?

829
01:04:31,827 --> 01:04:33,829
You don't wear a hat in the house,
white man. Even I know that.

830
01:04:43,381 --> 01:04:44,799
-Dr. Schultz.
-What a rare pleasure.

831
01:04:44,966 --> 01:04:46,384
Keep fighting, niggers.

832
01:04:46,551 --> 01:04:49,345
-And I might add, an honor.
-Honor to meet you.

833
01:04:49,512 --> 01:04:51,430
Please have a seat,
the pleasure's all mine.

834
01:04:51,597 --> 01:04:55,101
Get free man Django here
whatever he wants.

835
01:04:55,268 --> 01:04:57,562
And I'll have sweet tea and bourbon.

836
01:05:17,206 --> 01:05:20,251
Use your weight, boy,
use your weight! There you go.

837
01:05:20,418 --> 01:05:22,670
He's much bigger and stronger!

838
01:05:22,837 --> 01:05:24,422
Come on, now!

839
01:05:24,589 --> 01:05:27,091
He's not doing what I told him,
for God's sakes.

840
01:05:31,178 --> 01:05:33,973
Come on, now, boy!
It's a fight to the death!

841
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:37,226
You either hit him or are you ain't?

842
01:05:45,234 --> 01:05:48,321
Big Fred, come on!

843
01:05:48,487 --> 01:05:50,031
Turn him around! Now...

844
01:05:53,826 --> 01:05:58,164
Use your strength, boy!
Come on, now! Use your strength!

845
01:06:00,249 --> 01:06:02,043
There you go!

846
01:06:03,377 --> 01:06:05,838
There you go! Look at that.

847
01:06:06,922 --> 01:06:09,884
See, I told you to put
some more power in there.

848
01:06:10,051 --> 01:06:12,094
Do what I told you, boy!

849
01:06:12,261 --> 01:06:13,721
There you go!

850
01:06:13,888 --> 01:06:16,182
-No!
-Do what I told ya!

851
01:06:16,349 --> 01:06:19,393
Blind him black, boy!
Blind him black!

852
01:06:21,812 --> 01:06:24,315
Oh, no, Luigi.

853
01:06:27,526 --> 01:06:31,447
Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

854
01:06:32,073 --> 01:06:33,240
Oh...

855
01:06:43,793 --> 01:06:45,086
Finish him.

856
01:06:49,382 --> 01:06:51,133
Go on, boy, finish him!

857
01:06:55,638 --> 01:06:57,348
That's why they
call him Big Fred.

858
01:06:57,515 --> 01:07:00,935
-Worth every penny.
-Well, <i>arrivederci</i>, Luigi.

859
01:07:01,102 --> 01:07:03,312
Come on up, now, boy.
Get yourself a rest.

860
01:07:03,479 --> 01:07:06,482
You did a fine job.
A real fine job.

861
01:07:07,108 --> 01:07:08,818
Mercedes.

862
01:07:29,922 --> 01:07:31,132
Tequila.

863
01:07:41,142 --> 01:07:42,643
What's your name?

864
01:07:44,812 --> 01:07:46,313
Django.

865
01:07:48,733 --> 01:07:50,401
Can you spell it?

866
01:07:52,528 --> 01:07:56,574
D-J-A-N-G-O.

867
01:07:58,075 --> 01:07:59,577
The D is silent.

868
01:07:59,744 --> 01:08:01,328
I know.

869
01:08:09,295 --> 01:08:12,798
Mr. Moguy, want you to
take care of my new boy here.

870
01:08:12,965 --> 01:08:14,675
You find him a room
with a soft bed,

871
01:08:14,842 --> 01:08:17,428
then you bring him up
a pony to lick his pole.

872
01:08:17,595 --> 01:08:20,347
But you be ready to travel to Candyland
tomorrow morning, now, ya hear?

873
01:08:20,514 --> 01:08:21,515
Yessir, Monsieur Candie.

874
01:08:21,682 --> 01:08:25,561
Before you go,
Roscoe, get Fred here a tall beer.

875
01:08:29,398 --> 01:08:32,401
You enjoy that, boy.
You've earned it.

876
01:08:32,568 --> 01:08:33,861
Yessir.

877
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:47,166
-What's your name, boy?
-His name is Django Freeman.

878
01:08:50,711 --> 01:08:52,338
Where'd you dig him up?

879
01:08:52,505 --> 01:08:55,758
A fortuitous turn of events
brought Django and myself together.

880
01:08:57,468 --> 01:08:59,553
I've heard tell about you.

881
01:09:00,304 --> 01:09:03,057
I heard you been telling everybody
them Mandingos ain't no damn good.

882
01:09:03,224 --> 01:09:05,351
Ain't nothin' nobody
is sellin' is worth buyin'.

883
01:09:05,518 --> 01:09:09,730
I'm curious... what makes you
such a Mandingo expert?

884
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:14,109
I'm curious what makes you so curious.

885
01:09:17,404 --> 01:09:19,490
-What did you say, boy?
-Calm down, Butch.

886
01:09:20,533 --> 01:09:21,867
No offense given...

887
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:23,911
none taken.

888
01:09:24,078 --> 01:09:25,788
Monsieur Candie...

889
01:09:25,955 --> 01:09:29,458
I'd appreciate if you could
direct your line of inquiry toward me.

890
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:31,085
One...

891
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:34,839
you do not have anything to drink.
Can I get you a tasty refreshment?

892
01:09:35,005 --> 01:09:37,842
-Yes! I'll have a beer.
-<i>Wunderbar</i>.

893
01:09:38,008 --> 01:09:39,844
Roscoe, a beer
for the man with the beard,

894
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:41,846
and I will have a
Polynesian Pearl Diver.

895
01:09:42,012 --> 01:09:44,098
Do not spare the rum.

896
01:09:44,265 --> 01:09:47,768
Doc... I am a seasoned slaver.

897
01:09:47,935 --> 01:09:49,645
You are, well, you are a neophyte.

898
01:09:49,812 --> 01:09:54,942
I'm simply tryin' to ascertain if this
cowboy here is takin' advantage of you.

899
01:09:56,402 --> 01:09:59,613
With all due respect, Monsieur Candie...

900
01:10:00,322 --> 01:10:02,199
I didn't seek you
out for your advice.

901
01:10:02,366 --> 01:10:04,493
I sought you out to
purchase a fighting nigger

902
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:07,204
at above top-dollar market price.

903
01:10:07,371 --> 01:10:09,915
Now I was under the impression,
when you granted me an audience,

904
01:10:10,082 --> 01:10:12,459
it would be to discuss business.

905
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:17,631
Well, we weren't talkin' business yet.

906
01:10:17,798 --> 01:10:20,134
We were discussin' my curiosity.

907
01:10:22,428 --> 01:10:23,429
Thank you.

908
01:10:23,596 --> 01:10:26,307
Roscoe, Coco,
go outside and play.

909
01:10:28,309 --> 01:10:31,770
Sheba... you stay right there.

910
01:10:31,937 --> 01:10:33,480
I know you didn't mean me.

911
01:10:35,232 --> 01:10:37,735
-Prost!
-German.

912
01:10:38,652 --> 01:10:42,448
Now, according to Moguy,
if I do business with you,

913
01:10:42,615 --> 01:10:44,658
I'm doing business with both y'all.

914
01:10:44,825 --> 01:10:47,244
He does the eyeballin',
you the billfold? Is that it?

915
01:10:47,411 --> 01:10:51,165
Well, you don't make it sound
too flattering, but more or less, yeah.

916
01:10:51,332 --> 01:10:52,499
Hm.

917
01:10:53,792 --> 01:10:54,793
So...

918
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,879
Bright Boy...

919
01:10:57,046 --> 01:10:59,006
Moguy tells me
you looked over my African flesh

920
01:10:59,173 --> 01:11:01,342
and you was
none too impressed, huh?

921
01:11:01,508 --> 01:11:03,010
Not for top dollar.

922
01:11:05,179 --> 01:11:07,222
Well, then,
we got nothin' more to talk about.

923
01:11:07,389 --> 01:11:09,516
You see, you wanna buy
a beat-ass nigger from me,

924
01:11:09,683 --> 01:11:11,936
those are the beat-ass niggers
I wanna sell so...

925
01:11:12,102 --> 01:11:14,063
He don't wanna buy the niggers
you wanna sell.

926
01:11:15,022 --> 01:11:18,192
He wants the nigger
you don't wanna sell.

927
01:11:18,359 --> 01:11:22,655
Well, I don't sell the niggers
I don't wanna sell.

928
01:11:24,907 --> 01:11:28,577
Well, you won't sell your best.

929
01:11:28,744 --> 01:11:31,163
You won't even sell your second best.

930
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:35,000
But your third best...?
You don't want to sell him either.

931
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:39,088
But if I made you an offer so ridiculous
you'd be forced to consider it...

932
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,924
...who knows what could happen?

933
01:11:44,259 --> 01:11:46,553
And what do you consider ridiculous?

934
01:11:47,554 --> 01:11:51,642
For a truly talented specimen,
the right nigger?

935
01:11:53,394 --> 01:11:55,437
How much would you say, Django?

936
01:11:58,816 --> 01:12:00,526
Twelve thousand dollars.

937
01:12:05,072 --> 01:12:09,076
Well, gentlemen, you had my curiosity,

938
01:12:09,243 --> 01:12:11,161
but now you have my attention.

939
01:12:24,842 --> 01:12:30,514
Willie. Willie.
Hold up! Hold up. Ah!

940
01:12:30,681 --> 01:12:33,100
-Good morning, gentlemen.
-Good Dr. Schultz.

941
01:12:33,267 --> 01:12:37,187
-Beautiful morning, isn't it?
-You couldn't have picked a better one.

942
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:40,232
Please, won't you take a ride with us
here in the Victoria.

943
01:12:40,399 --> 01:12:41,942
Oh, thank you very much.

944
01:12:42,109 --> 01:12:44,236
You can tie your horse up back there.

945
01:12:52,453 --> 01:12:53,746
Django.

946
01:12:58,542 --> 01:13:02,171
Where I part company from many
of my phrenologist colleagues

947
01:13:02,337 --> 01:13:07,509
is I believe there is a level
above bright, above talented,

948
01:13:07,676 --> 01:13:11,805
above loyal that a nigger can aspire to.

949
01:13:11,972 --> 01:13:16,643
Say, one nigger that
just pops up in 10,000.

950
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:18,312
The exceptional nigger.

951
01:13:19,313 --> 01:13:21,356
Bright day, huh, Bright Boy?

952
01:13:22,483 --> 01:13:23,650
Sun is up.

953
01:13:24,818 --> 01:13:26,695
Shining on all of us.

954
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:34,369
-Have a seat, doc.
-Thank you.

955
01:13:34,536 --> 01:13:35,829
Quite an honor.

956
01:13:35,996 --> 01:13:37,706
-The honor is all ours.
-Thank you.

957
01:13:37,873 --> 01:13:41,251
But I do believe that,
given time,

958
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:44,379
exceptional niggers
like Bright Boy here...

959
01:13:45,339 --> 01:13:47,174
become if not frequent...

960
01:13:48,425 --> 01:13:50,052
more frequent.

961
01:13:51,804 --> 01:13:56,391
Bright Boy,
you are that one in 10,000.

962
01:13:56,558 --> 01:13:59,436
The name of the game is keep up,
not catch up, nigger.

963
01:14:12,324 --> 01:14:13,700
Whoa!

964
01:14:15,202 --> 01:14:18,622
-Touch your guns, you die.
-Everybody, calm down!

965
01:14:18,789 --> 01:14:20,707
Now I saw the whole thing.
No harm done.

966
01:14:20,874 --> 01:14:21,917
Are you kidding me?

967
01:14:22,084 --> 01:14:24,086
-This nigger just...
-I said no harm done!

968
01:14:24,253 --> 01:14:26,797
Now take your hand off your pistol!

969
01:14:27,881 --> 01:14:30,676
Butch, that means you too.

970
01:14:31,885 --> 01:14:34,888
Everybody stop antagonizing my guest.

971
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:38,600
Hoot! Get back up on your horse.

972
01:14:39,351 --> 01:14:40,894
He broke my collarbone!

973
01:14:41,061 --> 01:14:45,357
For God's sake, somebody please help
Hoot here back up on his goddamn horse.

974
01:14:45,524 --> 01:14:48,569
-Yessir, boss.
-Oh, now you are one lucky nigger.

975
01:14:49,945 --> 01:14:51,321
You better listen to your boss,
white boy.

976
01:14:51,488 --> 01:14:53,949
Oh, I'm gonna go
walking in the moonlight with you.

977
01:14:54,116 --> 01:14:55,909
You wanna hold my hand?

978
01:15:02,499 --> 01:15:05,169
Willie, take us home.

979
01:15:07,421 --> 01:15:09,423
Start moving!

980
01:15:15,804 --> 01:15:17,055
Head 'em out!

981
01:15:25,296 --> 01:15:28,848
♪ <i>I need 100 black coffins for 100 bad men</i>

01:16:02,684 --> 01:16:04,228
You got a problem
with your eyeball, boy?

994
01:16:04,394 --> 01:16:05,646
No, sir.

995
01:16:05,812 --> 01:16:07,314
You want a boot heel in it?

996
01:16:08,523 --> 01:16:09,483
No, sir.

997
01:16:09,650 --> 01:16:12,694
Then you keep your
goddamn eyeballs off me.

998
01:16:12,861 --> 01:16:15,989
You flash that bad look at me again,
I'll give you a reason not to like me.

999
01:16:16,156 --> 01:16:17,699
Now move, nigger!

1000
01:16:19,826 --> 01:16:21,954
You niggers are gonna
understand something about me.

1001
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,997
I'm worse than any of these
white men here.

1002
01:16:24,164 --> 01:16:27,751
You get the molasses out your ass,
you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.

1003
01:16:27,918 --> 01:16:30,963
He is a rambunctious sort,
ain't he?

1004
01:16:31,129 --> 01:16:32,464
Indeed.

1005
01:16:34,967 --> 01:16:38,345
May we stop for a moment
so I may put a word in my man's ear?

1006
01:16:38,512 --> 01:16:42,224
You know, I'm expecting to fall in love
once I see the specimens at Candyland,

1007
01:16:42,391 --> 01:16:45,477
so before that moment,
it would be good if I could have

1008
01:16:45,644 --> 01:16:50,023
a confidential strategy meeting
with my confidant.

1009
01:16:52,985 --> 01:16:54,820
You mind telling me
what the hell you doing?

1010
01:16:54,987 --> 01:16:57,030
I confirmed that Broomhilda's
at Candyland.

1011
01:17:01,076 --> 01:17:03,662
-You're sure it's her?
-He didn't call her by name,

1012
01:17:03,829 --> 01:17:07,207
but she's a young lady, whip marks
on her back and speaks German.

1013
01:17:07,374 --> 01:17:09,251
Now, while it's not wise to assume,

1014
01:17:09,418 --> 01:17:11,878
in this instance,
I think it's pretty safe.

1015
01:17:12,045 --> 01:17:16,675
Point being, don't get so
carried away with your retribution.

1016
01:17:16,842 --> 01:17:18,802
You lose sight of why we're here.

1017
01:17:18,969 --> 01:17:20,762
-You think I lost sight of that?
-Yes, I do.

1018
01:17:20,929 --> 01:17:23,432
Stop antagonizing Candie.

1019
01:17:23,598 --> 01:17:28,562
You're going to blow this whole charade,
or more than likely get us both killed.

1020
01:17:28,729 --> 01:17:33,400
And I, for one, don't intend to die
in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, USA.

1021
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:36,570
I'm not antagonizing him.
I'm intriguing him.

1022
01:17:36,737 --> 01:17:39,281
You're yelling abuse
at these poor slaves.

1023
01:17:40,282 --> 01:17:45,704
I recall the man who had me
kill another man in front of his son

1024
01:17:45,871 --> 01:17:47,664
and he didn't bat a eye.

1025
01:17:49,082 --> 01:17:50,208
You remember that?

1026
01:17:52,461 --> 01:17:53,795
Yeah, of course I remember.

1027
01:17:53,962 --> 01:17:57,424
What you said was that
this is my world...

1028
01:17:58,383 --> 01:18:00,385
and in my world you gotta get dirty.

1029
01:18:01,386 --> 01:18:04,264
So that's what I'm doing.
I'm gettin' dirty.

1030
01:18:07,934 --> 01:18:11,104
Well, you're paraphrasing a tad, but...

1031
01:18:12,564 --> 01:18:14,649
that was the general gist.

1032
01:18:18,403 --> 01:18:19,905
See you at Candyland.

1033
01:18:27,621 --> 01:18:30,207
All right, niggers, back at it.

1034
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,543
That means you too, Moonlight.

1035
01:19:20,924 --> 01:19:23,802
I'll be. D'Artagnan!

1036
01:19:23,969 --> 01:19:27,222
Now, boy, why do a
fool thing like run off?

1037
01:19:27,389 --> 01:19:29,474
I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.

1038
01:19:29,641 --> 01:19:30,934
Yes, you can.

1039
01:19:31,101 --> 01:19:34,646
You might not be able to win,
but your ass can fight.

1040
01:19:34,813 --> 01:19:37,232
Mr. Stonesipher, would you please
shut these goddamn dogs up?

1041
01:19:37,399 --> 01:19:40,026
-I cannot hear myself think!
-Quiet down, Marsha!

1042
01:19:40,193 --> 01:19:42,237
Marsha, hush up! Marsha!

1043
01:19:42,404 --> 01:19:43,947
Hush up! Hey!

1044
01:19:44,114 --> 01:19:46,741
Get these goddamn dogs
away from this nigger!

1045
01:19:56,251 --> 01:19:59,713
Come on now, boy...
get on out that tree.

1046
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:01,548
Yessir.

1047
01:20:24,112 --> 01:20:26,239
How long was he loose?

1048
01:20:26,406 --> 01:20:29,659
A night. Day.

1049
01:20:29,826 --> 01:20:31,453
Half the other night.

1050
01:20:32,579 --> 01:20:34,122
How far he get off the property?

1051
01:20:34,289 --> 01:20:35,999
'Bout 20 miles off the prop.

1052
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:38,293
Pretty far considering
that limp he got.

1053
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:39,836
Hm.

1054
01:20:41,087 --> 01:20:44,424
Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan
supposed to fight on Friday?

1055
01:20:44,591 --> 01:20:46,218
One-a this new lot.

1056
01:20:47,385 --> 01:20:50,096
Well, way he looks now, a blind Indian
wouldn't bet a bead on him.

1057
01:20:50,263 --> 01:20:52,766
Please, Monsieur Candie,
I ain't got it in me no more.

1058
01:20:52,933 --> 01:20:54,434
-Now, now, now, now, now.
-I can't...

1059
01:20:54,601 --> 01:20:57,020
Now, no beggin'.

1060
01:20:57,187 --> 01:20:59,648
No playin' on my soft heart.

1061
01:21:03,109 --> 01:21:05,654
-You in trouble now, son.
-Yessir.

1062
01:21:08,573 --> 01:21:12,118
I done paid $500 for you.

1063
01:21:12,285 --> 01:21:17,165
When I pay $500, then I expect
to get five fights out of a nigger

1064
01:21:17,332 --> 01:21:19,709
-'fore he roll over and play dead.
-Sir.

1065
01:21:19,876 --> 01:21:23,755
You got to understand
that I'm runnin' a business here.

1066
01:21:23,922 --> 01:21:26,633
-You fought three fights.
-But I won every one.

1067
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,301
Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

1068
01:21:28,468 --> 01:21:31,471
But that last one, you muddled the line
between winnin' and losin'.

1069
01:21:31,638 --> 01:21:32,681
Yessir.

1070
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:37,394
Still, the fact remains:

1071
01:21:37,561 --> 01:21:41,189
I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights!

1072
01:21:41,356 --> 01:21:43,900
So what about my $500, huh?

1073
01:21:45,777 --> 01:21:47,696
What about my $500?

1074
01:21:49,239 --> 01:21:50,782
You gonna reimburse me?

1075
01:21:56,788 --> 01:21:59,165
You even know what "reimburse" means?

1076
01:21:59,332 --> 01:22:01,376
Huh?

1077
01:22:07,674 --> 01:22:09,384
I'll reimburse you!

1078
01:22:13,138 --> 01:22:14,347
You will?

1079
01:22:15,557 --> 01:22:17,100
Yep.

1080
01:22:19,853 --> 01:22:22,564
You'll pay $500

1081
01:22:22,731 --> 01:22:26,192
for practically a one-eyed old Joe
ain't fit to push a broom?

1082
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:27,485
No, he won't.

1083
01:22:29,738 --> 01:22:31,823
He just tired of you
toyin' with him is all.

1084
01:22:32,741 --> 01:22:34,701
Matter of fact, so am I.

1085
01:22:34,868 --> 01:22:37,329
But we ain't payin' a penny
for that pickaninny.

1086
01:22:37,495 --> 01:22:39,289
Ain't got no use for him.
Ain't that right, doc?

1087
01:22:41,041 --> 01:22:42,250
You heard him.

1088
01:22:51,426 --> 01:22:55,180
You're gonna have to excuse
Mr. Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.

1089
01:22:55,347 --> 01:22:59,017
He ain't never seen a
nigger like you ever in his life.

1090
01:22:59,809 --> 01:23:01,770
Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?

1091
01:23:04,022 --> 01:23:05,482
That right.

1092
01:23:06,483 --> 01:23:07,817
For that matter...

1093
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:10,695
nor have I.

1094
01:23:16,785 --> 01:23:17,952
Now...

1095
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:22,248
seein' as you won't pay a penny
for this pickaninny here...

1096
01:23:24,751 --> 01:23:28,088
you won't mind me handlin'
this nigger any way I see fit?

1097
01:23:29,214 --> 01:23:30,757
He's your nigger.

1098
01:23:34,511 --> 01:23:36,596
Mr. Stonesipher?

1099
01:23:37,389 --> 01:23:41,351
Let Marsha and her bitches
send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.

1100
01:23:41,518 --> 01:23:46,314
Marsha! Marsha, hey, get him!

1101
01:23:47,774 --> 01:23:49,984
Get 'im, get 'im!

1102
01:23:51,027 --> 01:23:53,530
-Yeah!
-Whoo!

1103
01:23:53,697 --> 01:23:55,115
Whoo-ee!

1104
01:24:23,476 --> 01:24:25,520
Your boss looks a little
green around the gills

1105
01:24:25,687 --> 01:24:27,856
for a blood sport like nigger fighting.

1106
01:24:28,022 --> 01:24:32,652
Nah, he just ain't used to seein'
a man ripped apart by dogs is all.

1107
01:24:33,236 --> 01:24:34,529
Hm.

1108
01:24:35,613 --> 01:24:36,990
You are used to it?

1109
01:24:37,157 --> 01:24:40,118
I'm just a little more
used to Americans than he is.

1110
01:24:40,285 --> 01:24:44,998
-Hm.
-Now, Monsieur Candie...

1111
01:24:45,165 --> 01:24:46,791
whenever you're ready.

1112
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:50,336
We rode five hours
so you could show off your stock.

1113
01:24:50,503 --> 01:24:52,130
Let's get to it.

1114
01:24:53,339 --> 01:24:57,719
'Cause as of now,
if he's an example, I ain't impressed.

1115
01:24:59,929 --> 01:25:01,347
Follow me.

1116
01:26:58,631 --> 01:27:01,342
Line 'em up to the left here now, boy.

1117
01:27:02,969 --> 01:27:04,345
Stand up straight, now!

1118
01:27:05,513 --> 01:27:06,806
Get up there.

1119
01:27:06,973 --> 01:27:09,559
Get up there, boy. Come on.

1120
01:27:09,726 --> 01:27:11,352
Give me a line! Give me a line!

1121
01:27:11,519 --> 01:27:13,605
Get in line there! Straighten up!

1122
01:28:13,247 --> 01:28:14,874
Hello! Stephen, my boy!

1123
01:28:15,041 --> 01:28:17,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hello, my ass.

1124
01:28:17,877 --> 01:28:20,838
Who this nigger up on that nag?

1125
01:28:21,005 --> 01:28:24,342
Stephen, you have nails for breakfast?
What's-a matter? Why you so ornery?

1126
01:28:24,509 --> 01:28:26,886
-You miss me, huh?
-Oh, yessir.

1127
01:28:27,053 --> 01:28:30,598
I miss you like a hog miss slop!

1128
01:28:30,765 --> 01:28:34,686
Like a baby miss mammy's titty.

1129
01:28:34,852 --> 01:28:38,690
I miss you like I misses
a rock in my shoe.

1130
01:28:41,109 --> 01:28:45,571
Now, I aks you:
Who this nigger on that nag?

1131
01:28:45,738 --> 01:28:47,407
Hey Snowball?

1132
01:28:48,616 --> 01:28:52,203
Wanna know my name or
the name of my horse, you ask me.

1133
01:28:52,370 --> 01:28:55,206
Just who the hell you callin'
"Snowball," horse boy?

1134
01:28:55,373 --> 01:28:57,041
I'll snatch your
black ass off that nag there

1135
01:28:57,208 --> 01:28:58,584
-and in the mud so fast...
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1136
01:28:58,751 --> 01:29:00,837
-...make your head spin.
-Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.

1137
01:29:01,004 --> 01:29:05,299
Let's keep it funny.
Django here's a free man.

1138
01:29:05,466 --> 01:29:07,844
-This nigger here?
-That nigger there.

1139
01:29:08,011 --> 01:29:10,263
Let me at least
introduce the two of you.

1140
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:14,225
Django, this is another cheeky
black bugger like yourself, Stephen.

1141
01:29:14,392 --> 01:29:17,645
Stephen, this here's Django.
You two oughta hate each other.

1142
01:29:17,812 --> 01:29:21,816
Calvin, just who the hell is this nigger
you feels the need to entertain?

1143
01:29:21,983 --> 01:29:25,903
Django and his friend in gray here,
Dr. Schultz, are customers.

1144
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:27,447
And they are our guests, Stephen.

1145
01:29:27,613 --> 01:29:31,117
And you, you old decrepit bastard,
oughta show them every hospitality.

1146
01:29:31,284 --> 01:29:33,661
-You understand that?
-Yessir. Him I understand.

1147
01:29:33,828 --> 01:29:35,496
But I don't know why
I got to take lip off this nigger.

1148
01:29:35,663 --> 01:29:38,291
You don't have to know why.
Do you understand?

1149
01:29:39,292 --> 01:29:40,793
Yessir. I understand.

1150
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:43,421
Well, good.
They're spendin' the night.

1151
01:29:43,588 --> 01:29:45,715
Go up in the guest bedrooms
and get two ready.

1152
01:29:46,883 --> 01:29:48,551
He gonna stay in The Big House?

1153
01:29:48,718 --> 01:29:50,928
Stephen, he's a slaver.
It's different.

1154
01:29:51,095 --> 01:29:53,681
-In The Big House?
-Well, you got a problem with that?

1155
01:29:53,848 --> 01:29:56,142
Oh, no.
I ain't got no problem with it,

1156
01:29:56,309 --> 01:29:58,352
if you ain't got no problem
with burnin' the bed, the sheets,

1157
01:29:58,519 --> 01:30:00,855
the pillowcases, everything else when
this black-ass motherfucker's gone!

1158
01:30:01,022 --> 01:30:03,274
That is my problem!
They are mine to burn!

1159
01:30:03,441 --> 01:30:05,651
Now your problem right now
is makin' a good impression!

1160
01:30:05,818 --> 01:30:07,737
And I want you to start solvin'
that problem right now

1161
01:30:07,904 --> 01:30:09,530
and get them goddamn rooms ready!

1162
01:30:11,657 --> 01:30:13,576
Yessir, Monsieur Candie.

1163
01:30:15,036 --> 01:30:16,204
Go on, now.

1164
01:30:17,121 --> 01:30:19,540
Can't believe you brought
a nigger to stay in The Big House.

1165
01:30:19,707 --> 01:30:21,042
Your daddy rollin' over
in his goddamned grave.

1166
01:30:21,209 --> 01:30:24,754
Man, the lip on him. Whoo!
He's gettin' worse and worse.

1167
01:30:24,921 --> 01:30:26,089
Now...

1168
01:30:26,255 --> 01:30:30,927
Where is my beautiful sister?!

1169
01:30:31,094 --> 01:30:34,180
There she is!
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1170
01:30:34,347 --> 01:30:39,393
Dr. Schultz, this attractive
Southern belle is my widowed sister.

1171
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:43,564
Darlin', you are a tonic for tired eyes.

1172
01:30:44,816 --> 01:30:48,194
May I present to you
Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.

1173
01:30:48,361 --> 01:30:51,739
Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charly.
Y'all get your ass over by that pen.

1174
01:30:51,906 --> 01:30:54,033
-Come on, Charly. Come on, now!
-Let's go.

1175
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:55,243
You know where it is.

1176
01:30:55,409 --> 01:30:57,161
Like you on a rope!

1177
01:30:58,371 --> 01:31:01,124
Niggers don't walk around here,
niggers run!

1178
01:31:01,833 --> 01:31:04,836
-Monsieur Candie?
-Hm?

1179
01:31:05,002 --> 01:31:08,798
Yeah. About that matter about the
nigger girl you were talking about?

1180
01:31:08,965 --> 01:31:09,924
Nigger gal?

1181
01:31:10,091 --> 01:31:13,094
Yeah, I believe you mentioned
she spoke German.

1182
01:31:13,261 --> 01:31:15,847
Ah, yes! Hildi, what about her?

1183
01:31:16,013 --> 01:31:20,184
Do you think before the demonstration,
you could send her around to my room?

1184
01:31:20,351 --> 01:31:24,522
You little dickens, you.
I don't see why not.

1185
01:31:24,689 --> 01:31:28,067
Stephen, when you get through showin'
them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi,

1186
01:31:28,234 --> 01:31:30,069
get her cleaned up
and smellin' real nice,

1187
01:31:30,236 --> 01:31:31,654
and sent over to
Dr. Schultz's room here.

1188
01:31:31,821 --> 01:31:33,489
Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir,

1189
01:31:33,656 --> 01:31:36,325
there's-a somethin'
I ain't told you 'bout yet.

1190
01:31:36,534 --> 01:31:40,204
-What?
-Uh, Hildi in the Hot Box.

1191
01:31:41,706 --> 01:31:42,874
What's she doin' there?

1192
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:45,793
What you think she
doin' there in the Hot Box?

1193
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,420
She bein' punished.

1194
01:31:47,587 --> 01:31:49,922
-What she do?
-She run off again.

1195
01:31:50,089 --> 01:31:52,758
Jesus Christ, Stephen, how many people
ran away while I was gone?

1196
01:31:52,925 --> 01:31:55,428
-Two.
-When did she go?

1197
01:31:55,595 --> 01:31:58,097
Last night.
They brung her back this morning.

1198
01:31:58,264 --> 01:32:00,933
How bad did Stonesipher's dogs
tear her up?

1199
01:32:01,851 --> 01:32:05,354
Lucky for her,
they was out chasin' D'Artagnan's ass.

1200
01:32:05,521 --> 01:32:09,817
Bill and Cody went lookin' for her,
found her, brung her back.

1201
01:32:09,984 --> 01:32:12,904
Now, she a little beat-up.
But she done that to her own damn self

1202
01:32:13,070 --> 01:32:14,280
runnin' through them
damn bushes and shit.

1203
01:32:14,447 --> 01:32:16,115
How long she been in the box?

1204
01:32:16,282 --> 01:32:19,076
How long you think
she been in there? All damn day.

1205
01:32:19,243 --> 01:32:21,913
And the little bitch
got ten more days to be in there.

1206
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:25,124
-Still, take her out.
-Take her out? Why?

1207
01:32:25,291 --> 01:32:29,212
Because I said so, that's why.
Dr. Schultz is my guest.

1208
01:32:29,378 --> 01:32:30,338
Hildi is my nigger.

1209
01:32:30,504 --> 01:32:33,674
Southern hospitality dictates
I make her available to him.

1210
01:32:33,841 --> 01:32:37,053
-But, Monsieur Candie, she run off.
-Jesus Christ, Stephen.

1211
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:39,639
What is the point of havin'
a nigger that speaks German

1212
01:32:39,805 --> 01:32:42,266
if you can't wheel 'em out
when you have a German guest?

1213
01:32:42,433 --> 01:32:46,604
Now, I realize it is inconvenient,
but still, you take her ass out.

1214
01:32:46,771 --> 01:32:47,939
Yessir.

1215
01:32:49,232 --> 01:32:51,817
Lara Lee!
Will you and Cora be responsible

1216
01:32:51,984 --> 01:32:55,363
for gettin' Hildi cleaned up
and presentable for Dr. Schultz here.

1217
01:32:55,529 --> 01:32:56,906
Of course, darlin'.

1218
01:32:57,073 --> 01:33:01,953
Now, gentlemen, I do apologize, but I am
weary from our travels beyond words.

1219
01:33:02,119 --> 01:33:04,997
It is time for me to rest my tired eyes.

1220
01:33:09,835 --> 01:33:12,588
Y'all done heard the man!
Get her ass up outta there!

1221
01:33:12,755 --> 01:33:15,299
Cora! Come here!

1222
01:33:15,466 --> 01:33:18,511
Get over there and get her cleaned up,
bring her back over here to Dr...

1223
01:33:18,678 --> 01:33:21,055
-What he say your name is? Shoots?
-Schultz.

1224
01:33:21,222 --> 01:33:23,683
Schultz. Get her back over here.
Hurry up, girl.

1225
01:33:23,849 --> 01:33:27,228
Yessir.

1226
01:34:10,813 --> 01:34:13,524
Come on, girl. Stand up.

1227
01:34:43,554 --> 01:34:47,099
Is you comin' with me or is you gonna
sleep in that little box over yonder?

1228
01:36:22,278 --> 01:36:23,737
Hello, ladies.

1229
01:36:23,904 --> 01:36:27,283
Dr. Schultz.
May I introduce to you Broomhilda?

1230
01:36:31,454 --> 01:36:33,914
Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.

1231
01:36:35,374 --> 01:36:37,501
It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.

1232
01:36:38,544 --> 01:36:40,880
I've heard a lot of
good things about you.

1233
01:36:41,046 --> 01:36:43,841
Well, it's not every nigger
speaks German, don't ya know.

1234
01:36:47,094 --> 01:36:49,096
As I look at you now, Broomhilda,

1235
01:36:49,263 --> 01:36:54,226
I can see all the passions you inspire
are completely justified.

1236
01:36:57,563 --> 01:36:59,899
The doctor here speaks German.

1237
01:37:01,901 --> 01:37:03,861
And I've been informed you do as well?

1238
01:37:05,404 --> 01:37:07,573
Go ahead, girl.
Speak a little German.

1239
01:37:14,121 --> 01:37:15,748
Ha!

1240
01:37:15,915 --> 01:37:17,917
Astonishing.

1241
01:37:24,882 --> 01:37:27,092
-And I shall bring you...
-Much obliged.

1242
01:37:36,602 --> 01:37:37,728
<i>Ja</i>.

1243
01:38:01,126 --> 01:38:02,586
Don't be afraid.

1244
01:38:40,666 --> 01:38:43,168
Hm. Pardon.

1245
01:38:50,759 --> 01:38:52,052
<i>Danke</i>.

1246
01:40:37,491 --> 01:40:39,076
Hey, Little Trouble Maker.

1247
01:40:47,668 --> 01:40:50,963
You silver-tongued devil, you.

1248
01:40:52,548 --> 01:40:53,882
-Hurry up, girl.
-These ready, Miss Cora.

1249
01:40:54,049 --> 01:40:55,300
No, no, no, they drinkin' tonight.

1250
01:40:55,467 --> 01:40:58,429
Go downstairs, get the big jug with the
red stuff Monsieur Candie like, hear?

1251
01:40:58,595 --> 01:41:01,348
-Get your big pretty ass out the way.
-You know you like it.

1252
01:41:01,515 --> 01:41:03,726
That's 'cause
you knows what I like.

1253
01:41:03,892 --> 01:41:06,478
Ooh!
Come on with these biscuits, girl.

1254
01:41:06,645 --> 01:41:12,443
Look, Monsieur Candie, they were
all fine specimens, no doubt about it.

1255
01:41:12,609 --> 01:41:16,989
But the best three by far were Samson...

1256
01:41:18,365 --> 01:41:19,950
-What's that other one's name?
-Goldie.

1257
01:41:20,117 --> 01:41:23,454
Goldie. And Eskimo Joe.

1258
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:26,206
By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?

1259
01:41:26,373 --> 01:41:29,460
You never know how
these nigger nicknames get started.

1260
01:41:29,626 --> 01:41:32,212
His name was Joe, maybe one day
he said he was cold. Who knows?

1261
01:41:35,883 --> 01:41:41,221
Well, regardless, Samson's your best.
We all know that.

1262
01:41:41,388 --> 01:41:45,100
You will never sell him,
and I can see why. He's a champion.

1263
01:41:45,267 --> 01:41:49,021
Hm-hm.
All three are champions.

1264
01:41:49,688 --> 01:41:51,774
Samson's the champion.

1265
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:53,734
Them other two pretty good.

1266
01:41:55,027 --> 01:41:56,528
Calvin, now what's
this nigger you let...

1267
01:41:56,695 --> 01:41:57,821
It's all right.

1268
01:41:57,988 --> 01:42:00,073
You have to understand,
Monsieur Candie,

1269
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:03,619
while admittedly a neophyte
in the nigger fight game,

1270
01:42:03,786 --> 01:42:08,081
I do have a little bit of a background
in the European traveling circus.

1271
01:42:08,248 --> 01:42:09,333
Is that right?

1272
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:13,587
Hence, I have big ideas
when it comes to presentation.

1273
01:42:13,754 --> 01:42:14,713
Hm.

1274
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:17,341
I need something more
than just a big nigger.

1275
01:42:19,092 --> 01:42:21,303
Yeah, he needs to have panache.

1276
01:42:21,470 --> 01:42:24,556
-Need to have what? What?
-Panache. Uh...

1277
01:42:24,723 --> 01:42:27,476
-A sense of showmanship.
-Showmanship, yes.

1278
01:42:27,643 --> 01:42:30,854
I want to be able to bill him
as The Black Hercules.

1279
01:42:32,815 --> 01:42:34,191
Black Hercules,
isn't that clever?

1280
01:42:34,358 --> 01:42:35,359
More like Nigger-les.

1281
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:43,200
I said, and I quote,
"I would pay top dollar for...

1282
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:46,495
'the right nigger.'"

1283
01:42:46,662 --> 01:42:50,958
Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe
is the wrong nigger, per se.

1284
01:42:51,124 --> 01:42:53,836
But is he right as rain?

1285
01:42:55,087 --> 01:42:56,505
Oh, Dr. Schultz,

1286
01:42:56,672 --> 01:43:00,467
I will have you know there
is no one in the nigger fight game

1287
01:43:00,634 --> 01:43:02,553
that appreciates
the value of showmanship

1288
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:04,471
more than Monsieur
Calvin J. Candie here.

1289
01:43:04,638 --> 01:43:05,639
Nobody.

1290
01:43:05,806 --> 01:43:07,641
But one must not forget
the most important thing

1291
01:43:07,808 --> 01:43:09,184
-in the nigger fight game.
-Hm-mm.

1292
01:43:09,351 --> 01:43:11,353
And that is a nigger
that can win fights.

1293
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:12,729
Hm-mm.

1294
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:17,109
Now that should be your first, second,
third, fourth, and fifth concern.

1295
01:43:17,276 --> 01:43:19,319
Now, after you have that,
and you know you have that,

1296
01:43:19,486 --> 01:43:23,448
then you can start
to implement a grand design.

1297
01:43:23,615 --> 01:43:26,159
In other words, first thing is first.

1298
01:43:26,326 --> 01:43:27,786
First thing's first.

1299
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:38,839
Ooh! I see you two gettin' on.

1300
01:43:39,006 --> 01:43:40,883
Famously.

1301
01:43:41,633 --> 01:43:44,303
Oh, Monsieur Candie,
you can't imagine what it's like

1302
01:43:44,469 --> 01:43:47,806
not to hear your
native tongue in four years.

1303
01:43:47,973 --> 01:43:49,808
Well, hell,
I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.

1304
01:43:52,227 --> 01:43:54,271
Two weeks in Boston!

1305
01:43:54,438 --> 01:43:57,232
Monsieur Candie, you a mess!

1306
01:43:57,399 --> 01:43:59,109
Two weeks in Boston!

1307
01:43:59,276 --> 01:44:04,489
I can't express the joy I felt
conversing in my mother tongue.

1308
01:44:04,656 --> 01:44:08,744
And Hildi is a charming
conversation companion.

1309
01:44:08,911 --> 01:44:10,787
Well, be careful now,
Dr. Schultz.

1310
01:44:10,954 --> 01:44:12,289
You might-a caught yourself

1311
01:44:12,456 --> 01:44:13,707
-a little dose of nigger love.
-Hm!

1312
01:44:13,874 --> 01:44:15,959
Nigger love's
a powerful emotion, boy.

1313
01:44:16,126 --> 01:44:18,128
-Hm!
-It's like a pool of black tar.

1314
01:44:18,295 --> 01:44:19,922
Once it catches your ass, you're caught.

1315
01:44:20,088 --> 01:44:23,050
Yessir, you stuck.

1316
01:44:23,216 --> 01:44:24,760
I don't know, doctor.

1317
01:44:24,927 --> 01:44:27,179
You can lay on all the
German sweet talk you want,

1318
01:44:27,346 --> 01:44:31,850
but it looks like this pony's
got big eyes for Django.

1319
01:44:34,269 --> 01:44:36,730
Well, naturally.

1320
01:44:36,897 --> 01:44:40,525
It is the soaring eagle
that attracts her attention,

1321
01:44:40,692 --> 01:44:43,487
not the plucked chicken.

1322
01:44:43,654 --> 01:44:46,156
Dr. Schultz, don't be
so down on yourself.

1323
01:44:46,323 --> 01:44:48,241
You are quite the dapper
European gentleman.

1324
01:44:48,408 --> 01:44:49,451
You got to clean these dishes,

1325
01:44:49,618 --> 01:44:51,620
you got to put your elbow
in these dishes, you hear me?

1326
01:44:51,787 --> 01:44:53,997
You know that nigger, don't you?

1327
01:44:54,915 --> 01:44:56,208
-Who?
-"Who?"

1328
01:44:56,375 --> 01:44:59,461
Don't "who" me, bitch.
You know who I'm talkin' about.

1329
01:45:01,213 --> 01:45:03,215
At the table?

1330
01:45:03,382 --> 01:45:04,633
I don't know him.

1331
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:07,844
-You don't know him.
-No.

1332
01:45:08,011 --> 01:45:10,847
-"No," what?
-No, sir.

1333
01:45:15,477 --> 01:45:17,938
You wouldn't lie to me, now, would you?

1334
01:45:22,150 --> 01:45:23,360
Okay.

1335
01:45:24,611 --> 01:45:27,739
Yeah. If you say so.

1336
01:45:34,204 --> 01:45:37,624
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,
no doubt about it.

1337
01:45:39,001 --> 01:45:44,172
But if it was my money,
I wouldn't pay no $12,000 for him.

1338
01:45:44,339 --> 01:45:46,675
What would your price be?

1339
01:45:46,842 --> 01:45:48,802
Well, if I was inclined
to be generous...

1340
01:45:48,969 --> 01:45:52,431
and I don't know why
I would be inclined to be generous...

1341
01:45:53,390 --> 01:45:56,643
9,000. Maybe.

1342
01:45:57,894 --> 01:46:03,692
Dr. Schultz, let me reclarify how
this whole negotiation came about.

1343
01:46:03,859 --> 01:46:06,028
You see, it wasn't me
who came to you to sell a nigger.

1344
01:46:06,194 --> 01:46:07,154
Sure wasn't.

1345
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:09,031
It was you who approached me to buy one.

1346
01:46:09,197 --> 01:46:11,366
-Sure was.
-Now, that $9,000 figure

1347
01:46:11,533 --> 01:46:13,952
Bright Boy's been bandyin' about,
that ain't too far off from right.

1348
01:46:14,119 --> 01:46:15,746
And if I wanted to sell
Eskimo Joe for that,

1349
01:46:15,912 --> 01:46:18,874
-I could do so any day of the week.
-Any day.

1350
01:46:19,041 --> 01:46:23,295
But, like you said in Greenville,
doctor... I don't want to sell him.

1351
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:27,924
It was only your ridiculous
offer of $12,000

1352
01:46:28,091 --> 01:46:30,927
-that made me even consider it.
-Hm-mm.

1353
01:46:39,102 --> 01:46:43,190
You know, Monsieur Candie,
you do possess the power of persuasion.

1354
01:46:47,110 --> 01:46:49,529
Why not?
Monsieur Candie, you have a deal.

1355
01:46:49,696 --> 01:46:53,033
-Eskimo Joe, $12,000.
-Hooray, doctor.

1356
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:55,327
Hooray.
And a wise decision that is.

1357
01:46:55,494 --> 01:46:59,039
However, that is
a tremendous amount of money.

1358
01:46:59,206 --> 01:47:02,375
And the way you have
your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer.

1359
01:47:02,542 --> 01:47:04,336
Persnickety man named Tuttle.

1360
01:47:04,503 --> 01:47:07,589
And I would need my Mr. Tuttle
to draw up a legal contract

1361
01:47:07,756 --> 01:47:10,801
before I'd feel comfortable exchanging
that amount of money for flesh.

1362
01:47:10,967 --> 01:47:11,968
Hm-mm.

1363
01:47:12,135 --> 01:47:13,804
Not to mention having
Eskimo Joe examined

1364
01:47:13,970 --> 01:47:16,598
-by a physician of my choosing.
-Naturally.

1365
01:47:16,765 --> 01:47:21,478
So, say I return in about...

1366
01:47:23,647 --> 01:47:25,941
-...five days time.
-Five days?

1367
01:47:26,108 --> 01:47:27,359
With my Mr. Tuttle.

1368
01:47:27,526 --> 01:47:29,569
And then my Mr. Tuttle
and your Mr. Moguy

1369
01:47:29,736 --> 01:47:32,697
can hash out the finer
details between themselves.

1370
01:47:33,532 --> 01:47:36,576
I say splendid, doctor. Splendid.

1371
01:47:37,327 --> 01:47:38,495
Gentlemen...

1372
01:47:39,496 --> 01:47:41,498
may I propose a toast.

1373
01:47:43,875 --> 01:47:48,755
To Eskimo Joe.
Or shall we call him The Black Hercules?

1374
01:47:48,922 --> 01:47:51,591
To The Black Hercules.

1375
01:47:51,758 --> 01:47:53,135
The Black Hercules.

1376
01:47:53,301 --> 01:47:54,719
To The Black Hercules.

1377
01:47:54,886 --> 01:47:58,723
You was right, doctor.
That name do have pan-ass.

1378
01:47:58,890 --> 01:48:00,308
Hm.

1379
01:48:00,475 --> 01:48:03,728
Hildi, top my drink off.

1380
01:48:06,815 --> 01:48:11,862
So, Hildi, how you like servin'
at the big table in The Big House, huh?

1381
01:48:12,028 --> 01:48:15,240
When Monsieur Candie talk to you,
you answers.

1382
01:48:15,407 --> 01:48:18,160
-I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.
-Hm-mm.

1383
01:48:18,326 --> 01:48:21,079
It's a lot better than sizzlin'
in that Hot Box or draggin' your ass

1384
01:48:21,246 --> 01:48:22,581
through a bramble bush.

1385
01:48:22,747 --> 01:48:25,834
But maybe it's not quite as much fun as
gettin' to pleasure all them Mandingos,

1386
01:48:26,001 --> 01:48:27,586
-huh, sugar bear?
-Oh, Lord, she like them niggers.

1387
01:48:27,752 --> 01:48:28,920
-Sure do.
-Like Samson? Huh?

1388
01:48:29,087 --> 01:48:30,547
No, sir.

1389
01:48:30,714 --> 01:48:32,048
You know, Monsieur Candie,

1390
01:48:32,215 --> 01:48:35,886
the doctor here might be interested
in seein' Hildi's peeled back,

1391
01:48:36,052 --> 01:48:39,306
seein' as how they don't have
many niggers where he come from.

1392
01:48:39,472 --> 01:48:41,600
Dr. Schultz,
when you was alone with Hildi, here,

1393
01:48:41,766 --> 01:48:44,811
did you just speak German
or did you get to take her clothes off?

1394
01:48:44,978 --> 01:48:46,730
No, we just talked and...

1395
01:48:46,897 --> 01:48:49,274
Oh, so you
haven't seen her back?

1396
01:48:49,441 --> 01:48:51,234
-I haven't...
-No, no, no, no.

1397
01:48:51,401 --> 01:48:53,445
Stephen's right,
you might find this interesting.

1398
01:48:53,612 --> 01:48:56,698
Hildi, go on, take off your dress.
Show Dr. Schultz your back here.

1399
01:48:56,865 --> 01:48:58,825
-Go on.
-Uh, Calvin.

1400
01:48:58,992 --> 01:49:01,369
I just got her all dressed up
and lookin' nice.

1401
01:49:01,536 --> 01:49:04,456
But, Lara Lee,
Dr. Schultz is from Dusseldorf.

1402
01:49:04,623 --> 01:49:07,626
They don't got niggers there.
He is a man of medicine.

1403
01:49:07,792 --> 01:49:10,378
I'm sure it would fascinate him,
the niggers' endurance for pain.

1404
01:49:10,545 --> 01:49:14,132
These niggers are tough,
Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.

1405
01:49:14,299 --> 01:49:16,468
Hildi's got somethin'
like four lashes on her back.

1406
01:49:16,635 --> 01:49:18,553
Lara Lee just get one,
she'd lose her goddamn mind.

1407
01:49:18,762 --> 01:49:19,846
-Sure would.
-Look at that, doctor.

1408
01:49:20,013 --> 01:49:22,265
-It's like a paintin'. Look at that.
-Calvin!

1409
01:49:23,058 --> 01:49:26,102
We are eating. Ain't no one wanna
look at her whipped up back.

1410
01:49:27,771 --> 01:49:30,190
Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine.

1411
01:49:30,357 --> 01:49:33,026
After dinner, then, Stephen.
After dinner.

1412
01:49:34,236 --> 01:49:36,029
During the brandies, gentlemen, hm?

1413
01:49:42,410 --> 01:49:43,954
Cora, come get this girl!

1414
01:49:47,415 --> 01:49:50,627
-She a mess.
-Yes, ma'am.  Oh!

1415
01:49:50,794 --> 01:49:53,255
Why are you all undone?
I just got you done up.

1416
01:49:53,421 --> 01:49:54,756
Come on in here.

1417
01:50:01,263 --> 01:50:05,058
Baby, you on Stephen bad side,
and you need to be on his blind side.

1418
01:50:05,225 --> 01:50:07,185
You say you ain't know him.

1419
01:50:08,311 --> 01:50:09,396
Huh?

1420
01:50:09,562 --> 01:50:15,151
I said, you said you ain't know him.

1421
01:50:16,319 --> 01:50:19,698
-I don't.
-Yes, you do.

1422
01:50:21,866 --> 01:50:23,493
Mr. Stephen...

1423
01:50:24,494 --> 01:50:25,495
I don't.

1424
01:50:25,662 --> 01:50:28,164
Why is you lying to me?

1425
01:50:30,542 --> 01:50:31,876
I ain't.

1426
01:50:32,043 --> 01:50:34,546
Then why is you crying?

1427
01:50:34,713 --> 01:50:36,881
You scarin' me.

1428
01:50:37,048 --> 01:50:40,969
-Why is I'm scaring you?
-Because you scary.

1429
01:50:42,637 --> 01:50:45,724
To speak German
this afternoon with Hildi

1430
01:50:45,890 --> 01:50:49,019
was positively soul-enriching.

1431
01:50:49,185 --> 01:50:52,063
Doctor,
that warms my heart to hear that.

1432
01:50:52,230 --> 01:50:55,066
You stay right here.

1433
01:51:00,405 --> 01:51:04,909
You indicated earlier
you'd be willing to part with Hildi.

1434
01:51:05,076 --> 01:51:07,912
Why, yes.
Yessiree bob, I did.

1435
01:51:09,914 --> 01:51:15,879
In that case, allow me
to propose another proposition.

1436
01:51:16,046 --> 01:51:17,422
I'm all ears.

1437
01:51:17,589 --> 01:51:19,299
Hurry up, goddamn it!

1438
01:51:19,924 --> 01:51:21,509
-Monsieur Candie...
-Stephen!

1439
01:51:22,552 --> 01:51:25,013
You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here.

1440
01:51:26,139 --> 01:51:28,266
I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz.

1441
01:51:28,433 --> 01:51:31,144
My ears ain't worth a damn these days.

1442
01:51:31,311 --> 01:51:32,437
Excuse him.

1443
01:51:32,604 --> 01:51:36,358
Monsieur Candie, could I get
a word with you in the kitchen?

1444
01:51:36,524 --> 01:51:38,443
You mean get up out of my chair?

1445
01:51:38,610 --> 01:51:41,946
-If'n you could manage it.
-Why?

1446
01:51:42,113 --> 01:51:45,950
-It's about dessert.
-What about dessert?

1447
01:51:46,117 --> 01:51:48,745
I'd rather discuss that in private.

1448
01:51:48,912 --> 01:51:50,789
We're having white cake!

1449
01:51:50,955 --> 01:51:53,291
What sort of melodrama
could be brewing back there?

1450
01:51:53,458 --> 01:51:57,796
You right, Monsieur Candie.
You right. I'll handle it myself.

1451
01:51:57,962 --> 01:51:59,756
Meet me in the library.

1452
01:51:59,923 --> 01:52:03,009
I just can't understand why you
won't come talk to these niggers.

1453
01:52:03,176 --> 01:52:05,053
Shit get fucked up around here,
you blame me.

1454
01:52:05,220 --> 01:52:10,225
Fine! Fine. Friend Stephen,
I will be along momentarily.

1455
01:52:10,392 --> 01:52:11,559
Yessir.

1456
01:52:12,477 --> 01:52:16,147
Well, gentlemen, as you can see,

1457
01:52:16,314 --> 01:52:18,066
talented as they are,
no doubt, in the kitchen,

1458
01:52:18,233 --> 01:52:21,861
from time to time,
adult supervision is required.

1459
01:52:24,864 --> 01:52:26,658
If you'll excuse me a moment.

1460
01:52:32,831 --> 01:52:34,624
You may clear
the dinner service.

1461
01:52:36,084 --> 01:52:39,462
You heard him. Go on!
Get! Hurry up, girl.

1462
01:52:39,629 --> 01:52:45,051
So, Dr. Schultz, why don't you
regale us with a tale of the circus.

1463
01:52:45,218 --> 01:52:47,887
The circus?

1464
01:52:54,352 --> 01:52:56,146
What is the matter?

1465
01:53:01,401 --> 01:53:06,489
Them motherfuckers
ain't here to buy no Mandingos.

1466
01:53:06,656 --> 01:53:10,201
They wants that girl.

1467
01:53:10,368 --> 01:53:13,121
Stephen, what the hell
are you talking about? Hm?

1468
01:53:13,288 --> 01:53:16,458
They playing your ass for a fool
is what I'm talking about.

1469
01:53:16,624 --> 01:53:20,295
They ain't here for
no musclebound Jimmie.

1470
01:53:20,462 --> 01:53:22,630
They here for that girl.

1471
01:53:22,797 --> 01:53:25,425
Wh... What girl? Hildi?

1472
01:53:25,592 --> 01:53:29,220
Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django,
them niggers know each other.

1473
01:53:30,930 --> 01:53:32,515
He just bought Eskimo Joe.

1474
01:53:32,682 --> 01:53:35,059
-Did he give you any money?
-No! Not yet. But...

1475
01:53:35,226 --> 01:53:37,687
Then he ain't bought diddly.
Not yet, nohow.

1476
01:53:37,854 --> 01:53:40,106
But he's just about to buy

1477
01:53:40,273 --> 01:53:43,485
who he come here to buy
when I interrupted him.

1478
01:53:43,651 --> 01:53:46,654
"Thank you, Stephen."
You're welcome, Calvin.

1479
01:53:52,076 --> 01:53:54,078
Where you gettin' all this?

1480
01:53:55,205 --> 01:53:56,998
Why would they go through
all that trouble for a nigger

1481
01:53:57,165 --> 01:53:59,667
with a chewed up back,
ain't worth $300?

1482
01:53:59,834 --> 01:54:04,130
They doin' it 'cause that nigger
Django's in love with Hildi.

1483
01:54:04,297 --> 01:54:06,132
She probably his wife.

1484
01:54:06,299 --> 01:54:09,093
Now, why that German gives a fuck
who that uppity son of a bitch

1485
01:54:09,260 --> 01:54:12,347
is in love with,
I'm sure I don't know.

1486
01:54:14,933 --> 01:54:16,893
If she's who they want...

1487
01:54:17,477 --> 01:54:21,773
why this whole snake oil pitch
about Mandingos, then?

1488
01:54:21,940 --> 01:54:25,443
You wouldn't pay no
never mind to no $300.

1489
01:54:25,610 --> 01:54:31,074
But that 12,000? That made you
real friendly, now, didn't it?

1490
01:54:33,785 --> 01:54:35,453
Yes, it did.

1491
01:54:38,790 --> 01:54:40,416
His wife, huh?

1492
01:54:44,295 --> 01:54:48,007
If it had been a snake,
it would have bit me.

1493
01:54:51,302 --> 01:54:53,304
Those lying...

1494
01:54:54,138 --> 01:55:00,144
goddamn time-wastin'
sons of bitches.

1495
01:55:02,355 --> 01:55:03,523
Sons of bitches!

1496
01:55:04,148 --> 01:55:08,945
Out of New Orleans, so I have quite
a bit of practice with theater types.

1497
01:55:10,196 --> 01:55:11,656
Oh, there you are.

1498
01:55:11,823 --> 01:55:14,617
I was beginning to think that you
and that old crow run off together.

1499
01:55:16,411 --> 01:55:18,580
That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?

1500
01:55:18,746 --> 01:55:21,833
Lara Lee, I was just
looking out the big window.

1501
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:25,044
Billy Crash is out there
dealing with some shady slaver

1502
01:55:25,211 --> 01:55:26,296
trying to sell a passel of ponies.

1503
01:55:26,462 --> 01:55:30,341
Would you be a dear, go out there
and give them gals an eyeball? Hm?

1504
01:55:30,508 --> 01:55:32,760
-Of course, brother.
-Thank you, darling.

1505
01:55:46,024 --> 01:55:49,736
-Yeah. Business never sleeps.
-Hm-mm.

1506
01:55:51,779 --> 01:55:54,699
Apropos, before your exit,

1507
01:55:54,866 --> 01:55:58,870
we were discussing the possibility
of my purchasing Broomhilda.

1508
01:55:59,037 --> 01:56:01,956
Ah, yes. Yes, we were, doctor.

1509
01:56:02,123 --> 01:56:04,250
And we will again. In a moment.

1510
01:56:20,725 --> 01:56:22,769
Who's your little friend?

1511
01:56:27,732 --> 01:56:29,233
This is Ben.

1512
01:56:30,568 --> 01:56:35,573
He's a old Joe that
lived around here for a long time.

1513
01:56:35,740 --> 01:56:38,159
And I do mean a long damn time.

1514
01:56:39,243 --> 01:56:42,997
Old Ben here took care of my daddy...

1515
01:56:43,873 --> 01:56:45,917
and my daddy's daddy.

1516
01:56:46,084 --> 01:56:48,670
Till he up and keeled over one day...

1517
01:56:51,506 --> 01:56:53,174
Old Ben took care of me.

1518
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:59,555
Growing up the son of a huge
plantation owner in Mississippi

1519
01:56:59,722 --> 01:57:05,603
puts a white man in contact
with a whole lotta black faces.

1520
01:57:07,230 --> 01:57:12,527
I spent my whole life here,
right here in Candyland...

1521
01:57:13,778 --> 01:57:17,573
surrounded by black faces.

1522
01:57:19,617 --> 01:57:21,953
Now, seeing them every day,
day in, day out,

1523
01:57:22,120 --> 01:57:25,289
I only had one question:

1524
01:57:29,001 --> 01:57:31,462
Why don't they kill us?

1525
01:57:34,465 --> 01:57:39,637
Now, right out there on that porch,
three times a week for 50 years,

1526
01:57:39,804 --> 01:57:44,726
Old Ben here would
shave my daddy with a straight razor.

1527
01:57:44,892 --> 01:57:50,022
Now, if I was Old Ben, I woulda
cut my daddy's goddamn throat

1528
01:57:50,189 --> 01:57:53,609
and it wouldn't have taken me
no 50 years to do it, neither.

1529
01:57:56,154 --> 01:57:57,655
But he never did.

1530
01:57:59,532 --> 01:58:00,825
Why not?

1531
01:58:02,201 --> 01:58:06,998
You see, the science of phrenology

1532
01:58:07,165 --> 01:58:12,253
is crucial to understanding
the separation of our two species.

1533
01:58:14,088 --> 01:58:17,800
In the skull of the African here,

1534
01:58:17,967 --> 01:58:20,094
the area associated
with submissiveness

1535
01:58:20,261 --> 01:58:25,767
is larger than any human or any other
subhuman species on planet Earth.

1536
01:58:41,282 --> 01:58:43,242
If you examine...

1537
01:58:44,619 --> 01:58:46,788
this piece of skull here...

1538
01:58:53,085 --> 01:58:56,672
you will notice
three distinct dimples.

1539
01:59:00,259 --> 01:59:03,971
Here, here and here.

1540
01:59:04,138 --> 01:59:05,389
Now...

1541
01:59:05,556 --> 01:59:10,561
if I was holding the skull
of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,

1542
01:59:10,728 --> 01:59:13,231
these three dimples would be
found in the area of the skull

1543
01:59:13,397 --> 01:59:16,734
most associated with... creativity.

1544
01:59:17,401 --> 01:59:19,237
But this is the skull of Old Ben.

1545
01:59:19,862 --> 01:59:21,989
And in the skull of Old Ben,

1546
01:59:22,156 --> 01:59:24,450
unburdened by genius,

1547
01:59:24,617 --> 01:59:28,788
these three dimples exist in the area
of the skull most associated with...

1548
01:59:29,914 --> 01:59:31,249
servility.

1549
01:59:32,250 --> 01:59:34,001
Now, Bright Boy...

1550
01:59:34,919 --> 01:59:37,088
I will admit you are pretty clever.

1551
01:59:39,549 --> 01:59:41,634
But if I took this hammer here...

1552
01:59:43,761 --> 01:59:46,097
and I bashed in your skull with it...

1553
01:59:47,098 --> 01:59:52,436
you would have the same
three dimples in the same place...

1554
01:59:53,688 --> 01:59:55,147
as Old Ben.

1555
01:59:56,274 --> 01:59:59,861
Hey! Now lay your palms
flat on that tabletop!

1556
02:00:00,027 --> 02:00:02,989
If you lift those palms
off that turtle shell tabletop,

1557
02:00:03,155 --> 02:00:06,409
Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose
with both barrels of that sawed-off.

1558
02:00:07,493 --> 02:00:10,621
There have been a lot of lies said
around this dinner table here tonight,

1559
02:00:10,788 --> 02:00:13,124
but that you can believe!

1560
02:00:13,291 --> 02:00:16,085
Mr. Moguy, would you be
so kind as to collect the pistol

1561
02:00:16,252 --> 02:00:18,629
hanging off these boys' hips here?

1562
02:00:23,342 --> 02:00:25,761
-Thank you ever so much.
-Doctor.

1563
02:00:30,308 --> 02:00:31,684
Where were we?

1564
02:00:36,147 --> 02:00:37,565
Jackass.

1565
02:00:41,569 --> 02:00:43,070
Ah, yes.

1566
02:00:43,237 --> 02:00:45,990
I do believe you were
just getting ready to make me

1567
02:00:46,157 --> 02:00:48,618
a proposition to buy Broomhilda.

1568
02:00:48,784 --> 02:00:50,161
Am I right?

1569
02:00:54,165 --> 02:00:55,499
Right.

1570
02:00:57,919 --> 02:00:59,420
Bring out Hildi!

1571
02:01:02,173 --> 02:01:03,716
Get over there yonder.

1572
02:01:05,176 --> 02:01:07,428
Sit your ass in that goddamn...

1573
02:01:07,595 --> 02:01:08,846
Lay your hand
flat on that tabletop.

1574
02:01:09,013 --> 02:01:10,556
Now shut your mouth!

1575
02:01:14,852 --> 02:01:17,438
Dr. Schultz, in Greenville,

1576
02:01:17,605 --> 02:01:20,358
you yourself said that
for the right nigger

1577
02:01:20,524 --> 02:01:24,862
you'd be willin' to pay what some
may consider is a ridiculous amount.

1578
02:01:25,029 --> 02:01:28,074
To which me myself said,
"What is your definition of ridiculous?"

1579
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:32,203
To which you said, "$12,000."

1580
02:01:32,995 --> 02:01:34,747
Now, considering y'all

1581
02:01:34,914 --> 02:01:36,874
have ridden a whole lot of miles,

1582
02:01:37,041 --> 02:01:41,003
went through a whole lot of trouble,
and done spread a whole lot of bull

1583
02:01:41,170 --> 02:01:43,589
to purchase this
lovely lady right here,

1584
02:01:43,756 --> 02:01:49,720
it would appear that Broomhilda is,
in fact... the right nigger.

1585
02:01:49,887 --> 02:01:53,641
And if y'all want to leave
Candyland with Broomhilda,

1586
02:01:53,808 --> 02:01:59,438
the price is $12,000.

1587
02:01:59,605 --> 02:02:03,401
And I take it you prefer the "take it
or leave it" style of negotiation?

1588
02:02:05,653 --> 02:02:07,196
Yes, I do, doctor.

1589
02:02:08,030 --> 02:02:11,033
You see,
under the laws of Chickasaw County,

1590
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:14,745
Broomhilda here is my property.

1591
02:02:14,912 --> 02:02:20,042
And I can choose to do with
my property whatever I so desire!

1592
02:02:21,127 --> 02:02:23,421
And if y'all think my price...

1593
02:02:24,088 --> 02:02:26,799
for this nigger here
is too steep...

1594
02:02:26,966 --> 02:02:30,428
...what I'm gonna desire to do is...

1595
02:02:34,348 --> 02:02:37,476
take this goddamn hammer here
and beat her ass to death with it!

1596
02:02:37,643 --> 02:02:39,770
-Right in front of both y'all!
-Easy, big fella.

1597
02:02:39,937 --> 02:02:44,442
Then we can examine the three dimples
inside Broomhilda's skull!

1598
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:48,779
Now, what's it gonna be, doc?
Huh?

1599
02:02:48,946 --> 02:02:50,281
What's it gonna be?

1600
02:02:50,448 --> 02:02:54,326
May I lift the hands off the tabletop
in order to remove my billfold?

1601
02:02:55,536 --> 02:02:56,871
Yes, you may.

1602
02:03:10,634 --> 02:03:11,844
That 12.

1603
02:03:15,890 --> 02:03:17,767
Sold!

1604
02:03:17,933 --> 02:03:20,478
To the man with the exceptional beard

1605
02:03:20,644 --> 02:03:23,981
and his unexceptional nigger.

1606
02:03:29,820 --> 02:03:32,114
-Mr. Moguy.
-Yes, Calvin?

1607
02:03:32,281 --> 02:03:35,951
Will you make these gentlemen
a receipt for $12,000, please?

1608
02:03:36,118 --> 02:03:37,870
$12,000.

1609
02:03:40,998 --> 02:03:43,167
It was a pleasure doing
business with y'all.

1610
02:03:44,043 --> 02:03:45,795
Now, gentlemen...

1611
02:03:47,004 --> 02:03:48,881
if you care to
join me in the parlor...

1612
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:52,301
we will be serving white cake.

1613
02:05:20,639 --> 02:05:21,974
Well done, Calvin.

1614
02:05:24,476 --> 02:05:27,354
Excuse me.
Excuse me, ma'am?

1615
02:05:28,814 --> 02:05:32,484
Could you please stop playing Beethoven?
Take your hands off the harp!

1616
02:05:36,739 --> 02:05:37,823
Doctor!

1617
02:05:37,990 --> 02:05:40,618
-Doctor, you can't go in there!
-Stephen, Stephen.

1618
02:05:40,784 --> 02:05:41,952
He ain't got no business
going in there.

1619
02:05:42,119 --> 02:05:43,454
Let it be.

1620
02:05:43,621 --> 02:05:45,539
He's just a little upset, that's all.

1621
02:05:45,706 --> 02:05:47,124
I'll handle this.

1622
02:06:12,983 --> 02:06:14,276
White cake?

1623
02:06:15,277 --> 02:06:17,529
I don't go in for sweets, thank you.

1624
02:06:18,572 --> 02:06:19,782
Hm.

1625
02:06:27,498 --> 02:06:30,209
You brooding about me
getting the best of you, huh?

1626
02:06:30,918 --> 02:06:35,673
Actually, I was thinking of that
poor devil you fed to the dogs today.

1627
02:06:35,839 --> 02:06:37,675
D'Artagnan.

1628
02:06:38,467 --> 02:06:42,263
And I was wondering what
Dumas would make of all this.

1629
02:06:42,429 --> 02:06:43,889
Come again?

1630
02:06:46,976 --> 02:06:51,021
Alexandre Dumas.
He wrote The Three Musketeers.

1631
02:06:51,188 --> 02:06:52,856
Yes, of course, doctor.

1632
02:06:53,023 --> 02:06:54,566
I figured you must be an admirer.

1633
02:06:54,733 --> 02:06:59,154
You named your slave
after his novel's lead character.

1634
02:06:59,321 --> 02:07:03,033
Now, if Alexandre Dumas
had been there today,

1635
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:05,160
I wonder what
he would have made of it.

1636
02:07:07,204 --> 02:07:09,039
You doubt he'd approve, huh?

1637
02:07:11,250 --> 02:07:16,422
Yes. His approval would be
a dubious proposition at best.

1638
02:07:18,716 --> 02:07:20,509
Soft-hearted Frenchie.

1639
02:07:22,386 --> 02:07:24,596
Alexandre Dumas is black.

1640
02:07:28,434 --> 02:07:31,228
-Are these Broomhilda's papers?
-Yes, they are.

1641
02:07:31,395 --> 02:07:33,063
-May I?
-Of course.

1642
02:07:33,230 --> 02:07:34,606
Thank you.

1643
02:07:36,734 --> 02:07:39,695
That is her bill of sale,
her ownership history,

1644
02:07:39,862 --> 02:07:42,031
and, of course,
her freedom papers, doctor.

1645
02:07:42,197 --> 02:07:44,408
Would you have ink and pen for me?

1646
02:07:45,659 --> 02:07:48,579
-Right over there on that little table.
-Thank you.

1647
02:08:09,892 --> 02:08:11,101
Thank you.

1648
02:08:14,688 --> 02:08:16,982
Broomhilda Von Shaft...

1649
02:08:19,234 --> 02:08:21,612
consider yourself a free woman.

1650
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:35,501
Mr. Candie...

1651
02:08:37,461 --> 02:08:41,256
normally,
I would say <i>auf Wiedersehen</i>.

1652
02:08:41,423 --> 02:08:45,886
But since what <i>auf Wiedersehen</i> actually
means is "till I see you again"

1653
02:08:46,053 --> 02:08:48,389
and since I never
wish to see you again,

1654
02:08:48,555 --> 02:08:53,227
to you, sir... I say, "goodbye."

1655
02:08:57,106 --> 02:08:58,399
Let's go.

1656
02:08:59,358 --> 02:09:00,901
Come on.

1657
02:09:02,611 --> 02:09:04,696
One more moment, doctor!

1658
02:09:06,573 --> 02:09:07,616
What?

1659
02:09:12,329 --> 02:09:14,456
It's a custom here in the South...

1660
02:09:14,957 --> 02:09:20,337
once a business deal is concluded
that the two parties shake hands.

1661
02:09:21,171 --> 02:09:23,215
It implies good faith.

1662
02:09:23,382 --> 02:09:26,427
-I'm not from the South.
-But you are...

1663
02:09:26,593 --> 02:09:28,887
in my house, doctor.

1664
02:09:29,763 --> 02:09:32,683
-So I'm afraid I must insist.
-Insist?

1665
02:09:32,850 --> 02:09:34,852
On what?
That I shake your hand?

1666
02:09:35,018 --> 02:09:38,313
Oh, then I'm afraid
I must insist in the opposite direction.

1667
02:09:38,939 --> 02:09:41,942
-You know what I think you are?
-What you think I am?

1668
02:09:42,109 --> 02:09:43,902
No, I don't.

1669
02:09:45,571 --> 02:09:50,784
-I think you are a bad loser.
-And I think you're an abysmal winner.

1670
02:09:50,951 --> 02:09:55,914
Nevertheless, here in Chickasaw
County, a deal ain't done

1671
02:09:56,081 --> 02:09:58,709
until the two parties
have shook hands.

1672
02:09:59,585 --> 02:10:02,421
Even after all that paper signin',
don't mean shit...

1673
02:10:03,380 --> 02:10:06,884
you don't shake my hand.

1674
02:10:07,843 --> 02:10:13,515
If I don't shake your hand,
you're gonna throw away $12,000?

1675
02:10:13,682 --> 02:10:15,434
I don't think so.

1676
02:10:16,435 --> 02:10:17,603
Mr. Pooch?

1677
02:10:19,438 --> 02:10:24,151
If she tries to leave here before this
nigger-loving German shakes my hand,

1678
02:10:24,318 --> 02:10:26,069
you cut her ass down.

1679
02:10:48,091 --> 02:10:51,428
You really want me to shake your hand?

1680
02:10:53,096 --> 02:10:54,681
I insist.

1681
02:10:55,766 --> 02:10:58,435
If you insist.

1682
02:11:15,035 --> 02:11:18,038
No! Calvin!

1683
02:11:19,122 --> 02:11:20,707
Calvin!

1684
02:11:27,047 --> 02:11:29,550
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

1685
02:11:41,812 --> 02:11:43,981
Nigger's gone crazy! Help!

1686
02:11:44,147 --> 02:11:45,941
Help, he's killing everyone!

1687
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,126
Holy...!

1688
02:12:04,293 --> 02:12:06,503
Shit! Son of a bitch!

1689
02:12:10,674 --> 02:12:11,883
Damn it! Fuckin'...!

1690
02:12:12,050 --> 02:12:14,386
Get the...!

1691
02:12:16,388 --> 02:12:17,848
Damn it, son of a bitch!

1692
02:12:18,015 --> 02:12:19,558
What...? Fucking...

1693
02:12:19,725 --> 02:12:21,351
Goddamn it!

1694
02:12:22,686 --> 02:12:24,980
What the fuck is going on?

1695
02:12:25,147 --> 02:12:27,107
You shot me!

1696
02:12:27,274 --> 02:12:30,360
-You stupid son of a bitch!
-Sorry, Jessie!

1697
02:12:30,527 --> 02:12:34,656
Who the fuck gave a nigger
a goddamn gun?

1698
02:13:04,686 --> 02:13:05,812
Aim low!

1699
02:13:08,148 --> 02:13:09,983
Nigger! Gonna kill...!

1700
02:13:10,942 --> 02:13:13,111
Oh God! Oh, my God!

02:14:40,323 --> 02:14:41,825
Hold your fire!

Stop shootin', goddamn it!

what you believe or don't believe!

02:15:41,843 --> 02:15:44,888
I believe if you don't
give up in the next ten seconds,

1722
02:15:45,055 --> 02:15:48,934
we gonna blow this bitch's brains out!
Believe that!

1723
02:15:51,186 --> 02:15:54,940
Don't do it.
You give me up.

Something to do
with the Old Man's funeral.

1757
02:19:18,393 --> 02:19:22,188
Oh, and she changed her mind
'bout snipping Django.

1758
02:19:22,981 --> 02:19:25,817
She gonna give him
to the LeQuint Dickey people.

Well, she didn't
waste a minute telling me.

This here what you take with you.

1763

Your black ass has been all them
motherfuckers at The Big House

for the last few hours.

1765
02:20:18,411 --> 02:20:22,123
Seem like white folk ain't never
had a bright idea in they life

1766
02:20:22,290 --> 02:20:25,001
was coming up with all
kinds of ways to kill your ass.

1767
02:20:25,168 --> 02:20:30,465
Now, mind you, most of them ideas had
to do with fuckin' with your fun parts.

1768
02:20:30,632 --> 02:20:36,179
Now, that may seem like a good idea,
but truth is...

1769
02:20:37,764 --> 02:20:40,016
when you snip a nigger's nuts,

1770
02:20:40,183 --> 02:20:44,395
most of them bleed out in,
oh, about, hm... seven minutes.

1771
02:20:44,562 --> 02:20:46,147
Most of 'em.

1772
02:20:46,356 --> 02:20:49,526
Well, more than most.

1773
02:20:50,276 --> 02:20:56,116
Then I says: "Shitfire.

1774
02:20:56,282 --> 02:21:00,286
The niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey
got it worse than that."

1775
02:21:01,329 --> 02:21:04,040
And they still sayin',
"Let's whip him to death."

1776
02:21:04,207 --> 02:21:07,502
Or "Throw him to the Mandingos."
"Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs."

1777
02:21:07,669 --> 02:21:10,880
And I said,
"What's so special about that?

1778
02:21:11,047 --> 02:21:13,174
We do that shit all the time.

1779
02:21:13,341 --> 02:21:19,222
Hell's bells, the niggers we sell to
LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that."

1780
02:21:20,348 --> 02:21:23,059
Lo and behold,

1781
02:21:23,226 --> 02:21:28,064
out of nowhere, Miss Lara
come up with the bright idea

1782
02:21:28,231 --> 02:21:31,693
of giving your ass to the
LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.

1783
02:21:34,070 --> 02:21:39,200
And as a slave of the
LeQuint Dickey Mining Company,

1784
02:21:39,367 --> 02:21:42,912
henceforth, till the day you die,

1785
02:21:43,079 --> 02:21:46,207
all day, every day,

1786
02:21:46,374 --> 02:21:49,210
you will be swinging
a sledgehammer,

1787
02:21:49,377 --> 02:21:54,007
turning big rocks into little rocks.

1788
02:21:54,174 --> 02:21:58,761
Now, when you get there,
they gonna take away your name,

1789
02:21:58,928 --> 02:22:01,848
give you a number
and a sledgehammer,

1790
02:22:02,015 --> 02:22:04,434
and say, "Get to work!"

1791
02:22:04,601 --> 02:22:07,020
One word of sass,
they cuts out your tongue.

1792
02:22:07,187 --> 02:22:09,522
And they good at it too.
You won't bleed out.

1793
02:22:09,689 --> 02:22:13,359
Oh, they does that real good.

1794
02:22:13,526 --> 02:22:15,111
They gonna work ya.

1795
02:22:15,278 --> 02:22:20,283
All day, every day,
till your back give out.

1796
02:22:20,450 --> 02:22:23,036
Then they're gonna hit you
in the head with a hammer,

1797
02:22:23,203 --> 02:22:25,622
throw your ass down the nigger hole.

1798
02:22:25,788 --> 02:22:31,169
And that will be the story of you,

on Smitty Bacall and the Bacall Gang.

Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?

Smitty Bacall is the leader of this

'Cause they just got away with murder.

But it ain't got to be that way.

These sons of bitches,
they killed innocent people.

Stagecoach robbery.
Innocent white people.

-That's a shitload.
-I'm a bounty hunter.

02:25:14,957 --> 02:25:17,543
Yesterday, as a free man,

1844
02:25:17,710 --> 02:25:22,256
I rode into Candyland on a horse
with my German white partner,

1845
02:25:22,423 --> 02:25:23,966
Dr. King Schultz.

1846
02:25:24,133 --> 02:25:28,888
We tracked the Bacall Gang all the way
from Texas to Chickasaw County.

1847
02:25:29,055 --> 02:25:31,974
We finally found their ass
layin' low in Candyland.

1848
02:25:32,141 --> 02:25:35,645
We went in there to get 'em,
things went sour,

1849
02:25:35,812 --> 02:25:39,148
my partner got killed,
Calvin Candie got shot,

1850
02:25:39,315 --> 02:25:43,486
then everybody there
decided to blame me, so here I am.

1851
02:25:45,488 --> 02:25:47,407
But y'all know I ain't on that manifest.

1852
02:25:47,573 --> 02:25:50,368
And all y'all know
I ain't supposed to be on this trip.

1853
02:25:50,535 --> 02:25:53,871
But them four men is still back there,
they're still wanted,

1854
02:25:54,038 --> 02:25:57,333
and that 11,500 is up for grabs,
and the last thing they'd expect

1855
02:25:57,500 --> 02:25:59,752
is y'all ridin' back in there
and gettin' it.

1856
02:25:59,919 --> 02:26:01,671
What's the deal?

1857
02:26:01,838 --> 02:26:05,299
You tell us who they are
and we turn you loose?

1858
02:26:05,466 --> 02:26:08,344
No, no, no, no.
I ain't gonna tell you who they are.

1859
02:26:08,511 --> 02:26:12,014
But, you give me a pistol,
one of them horses,

1860
02:26:12,181 --> 02:26:16,686
and $500 of that 11,500,
and I'll point 'em out to you.

1861
02:26:16,853 --> 02:26:18,729
This is a real handbill.

1862
02:26:18,896 --> 02:26:19,939
Now just 'cause it's a real handbill

1863
02:26:20,106 --> 02:26:22,191
doesn't mean that other
bunch of malarkey is.

1864
02:26:22,358 --> 02:26:28,281
Now why would a slave have a "Wanted
Dead or Alive" handbill in his pocket?

1865
02:26:32,952 --> 02:26:35,746
Did that black ride
into Candyland yesterday?

1866
02:26:42,086 --> 02:26:46,048
All right, I'm gonna ask you again.

1867
02:26:47,258 --> 02:26:49,886
I want you to remember,
I don't like liars.

1868
02:26:50,595 --> 02:26:52,430
Is he a Candyland slave,

1869
02:26:52,597 --> 02:26:56,392
or did he ride in with a white man
on a horse yesterday?

1870
02:26:56,559 --> 02:27:00,229
Yeah. They walked us
from the Greenville auction,

1871
02:27:00,396 --> 02:27:02,940
and he rode in on a horse
with a white man.

1872
02:27:03,608 --> 02:27:07,778
Now this white man,
was the black his slave?

1873
02:27:07,945 --> 02:27:09,447
He weren't no slave.

1874
02:27:09,614 --> 02:27:13,451
-You fuckin' sure about that?
-Damn sure.

1875
02:27:17,413 --> 02:27:20,958
-What happened over in Candyland?
-Bunch-a shootin'.

1876
02:27:21,125 --> 02:27:22,919
Massa got shot.

1877
02:27:23,085 --> 02:27:25,213
-Who shot him?
-The German.

1878
02:27:25,379 --> 02:27:26,422
Why'd he do that?

1879
02:27:27,089 --> 02:27:30,551
Nigger and the German was actin'
like they were slavers but they wasn't.

1880
02:27:30,718 --> 02:27:33,804
-Well, what were they?
-Bounty hunters.

1881
02:27:34,889 --> 02:27:38,226
Fuck me, Roy.
I mean, this could be big, mate.

1882
02:27:39,268 --> 02:27:42,480
Well, smoke, you got a deal.

1883
02:27:43,981 --> 02:27:46,817
-I got one more condition.
-What's that?

1884
02:27:46,984 --> 02:27:50,780
When we get there, when time come...

1885
02:27:52,156 --> 02:27:55,117
-...you let me help you kill 'em.
-Hey...

1886
02:27:55,284 --> 02:27:56,953
You're a funny bugger.

1887
02:27:57,119 --> 02:27:59,497
-Cut him loose.
-Yeah, yeah.

1888
02:27:59,664 --> 02:28:01,457
You got yourself a deal, blackie.

1889
02:28:01,624 --> 02:28:03,793
You got yourself a deal, mate.

1890
02:28:03,960 --> 02:28:05,670
Hey!

1891
02:28:05,836 --> 02:28:07,171
You're all right for a black fella.

1892
02:28:07,338 --> 02:28:08,589
Oh, yeah.

1893
02:28:13,803 --> 02:28:15,471
There we go.
There you go, mate.

1894
02:28:15,638 --> 02:28:17,014
Yeah.

1895
02:28:17,181 --> 02:28:19,850
We're gonna give you
that packhorse over there.

1896
02:28:20,017 --> 02:28:21,978
What them saddlebags got in 'em?

1897
02:28:22,144 --> 02:28:24,021
-Dynamite.
-No. I ain't ridin' no horse

1898
02:28:24,188 --> 02:28:26,107
with no goddamn dynamite on its back.

1899
02:28:26,274 --> 02:28:28,150
I can understand that.

1900
02:28:28,317 --> 02:28:31,153
Frankie, why don't you
take them sticks off that horse

1901
02:28:31,320 --> 02:28:33,155
and stick 'em in the nigger cage.

1902
02:28:34,782 --> 02:28:36,951

black fellas to play with.

rifle up on the wagon, don't ya?

Yeah, right.

1905
02:28:52,508 --> 02:28:55,052
Why don't you give him
your gun and gun belt?

1906

Righto.
