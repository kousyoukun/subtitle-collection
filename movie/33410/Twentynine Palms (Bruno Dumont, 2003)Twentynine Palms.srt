1
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:48,893
Who is it?

2
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,138
Everything okay?

3
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,846
Everything's fine...

4
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,475
my love.

5
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,056
Look!

6
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:07,816
It's fantastic.

7
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,374
No.

8
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:44,157
Still not taking your photo?

9
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,239
What are you thinking?

10
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,740
I'm thinking nothing.

11
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,516
You're thinking something.

12
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,280
Nothing.

13
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,545
That's not true.

14
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,591
It's true!

15
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,864
Why wouldn't you tell me?

16
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:54,952
What?

17
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:57,222
Katia!

18
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,034
You love me?

19
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,942
More, more!

20
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,885
What do you want for dinner?

21
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:13,929
No idea.

22
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,033
Chinese?

23
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,909
Seen a place?

24
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:26,967
Yes.

25
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,514
Great.

26
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,489
It's always the same.

27
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,791
Yeah.

28
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,696
What's that?

29
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,341
I don't know.

30
00:17:58,477 --> 00:17:59,603
I think...

31
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,306
There, I've finished.

32
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,832
Why don't you ask him?

33
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,609
Want me to do it? I can go ask him.

34
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,512
Fine.

35
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:31,059
What's that guy eating?

36
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:59,259
She's upset. We didn't order much.
It's normal.

37
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,772
Are you happy to start scouting?

38
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,476
I'm happy...

39
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,608
to be here...

40
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,650
with you.

41
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,970
Go on.

42
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:46,971
You can go with her.

43
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:50,941
Go on.

44
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,378
Come on!

45
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,744
You drive.

46
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,793
- Okay?
- Yes.

47
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:44,760
Go on.

48
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:49,171
Can you tell me where the brake is?

49
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,003
The accelerator?

50
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,576
You push here.

51
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:55,474
Wait...

52
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,752
The brake. Push it.

53
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:08,850
Go.

54
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:13,223
Slowly, yes.

55
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,392
Katia, slowly.

56
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,468
Very good.

57
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:24,298
Turn left.

58
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:57,439
Is it serious?

59
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,038
I'm sorry, I do stupid things.

60
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,873
You think it'll be okay?

61
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,740
I'm sorry.

62
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,753
And it's not over, not yet.

63
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:20,815
I'm sorry, if you want to help,
you need to help me properly.

64
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:25,856
No, David, stop!

65
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:52,469
No.

66
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:53,937
Why not?

67
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:55,070
Not here.

68
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,708
Okay.

69
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:05,783
Let's go.

70
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:06,077
I'm too dry, my love.

71
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:12,737
Let's lie down.

72
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,340
It hurts.

73
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,414
My ass.

74
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,658
You can lie on my feet.

75
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,139
We're going to burn.

76
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,379
Let's burn!

77
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:55,351
Sheltered!

78
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:06,487
I'm burning.

79
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,154
Me too.

80
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:36,810
It's beautiful here.

81
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:18,792
Let's go.

82
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,262
I don't want to go back.

83
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:27,064
Let's go.

84
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,930
I don't want to go back.

85
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:46,254
Please...

86
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:48,452
Why?

87
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,193
Because.

88
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:02,423
You hear that?

89
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,455
The storm...

90
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:09,765
We have to leave.

91
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:12,266
It's dangerous.

92
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,268
No, that's not true.

93
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:45,800
Oh, that's good.

94
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,121
You're crazy!

95
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,776
I'm sorry.

96
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:24,366
I'm sorry...

97
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:26,693
You hurt me.

98
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:48,434
What's that?

99
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:51,640
A father confessing to his wife...

100
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:54,878
that he has slept with his daughter.

101
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:06,662
The poor thing.

102
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,121
Who?

103
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:10,694
The mother.

104
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:33,916
You wouldn't do that?

105
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:35,384
What?

106
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:37,524
Are you crazy?

107
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,713
What are we going to do?

108
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:04,277
I don't know.

109
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:08,019
I'm hungry.

110
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:09,889
Already!

111
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:16,226
All right.

112
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:25,938
Great!

113
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:37,992
Found it?

114
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:39,124
Yes.

115
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:41,827
I don't know which one to get.

116
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:48,001
- What did you buy?
- Cream for me.

117
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,294
Let's go there!

118
00:52:27,271 --> 00:52:28,795
I'm starving!

119
00:52:47,625 --> 00:52:49,388
Hey, she's too tall.

120
00:52:51,395 --> 00:52:52,589
What?

121
00:52:55,533 --> 00:52:56,830
You think so?

122
00:52:56,901 --> 00:52:58,766
Don't you think so?

123
00:53:26,397 --> 00:53:27,625
What?

124
00:53:30,268 --> 00:53:32,133
You wouldn't want me...

125
00:53:33,337 --> 00:53:36,568
to shave my head like them?

126
00:53:37,708 --> 00:53:39,835
If you do, I'll...

127
00:53:49,687 --> 00:53:51,245
If you do...

128
00:53:52,823 --> 00:53:54,450
I'll leave you.

129
00:53:58,796 --> 00:54:00,787
You don't like Marines?

130
00:54:01,065 --> 00:54:03,727
I do! They're really handsome.

131
00:54:07,672 --> 00:54:09,196
That's how it is.

132
00:54:16,948 --> 00:54:19,246
What are you talking about?

133
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,857
Is it good?

134
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:34,459
It's not good.

135
00:54:37,201 --> 00:54:38,759
But it's good.

136
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:47,807
I don't understand.

137
00:54:50,147 --> 00:54:52,581
You say things I don't understand.

138
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:55,675
There's nothing to understand.

139
00:54:58,322 --> 00:54:59,448
Fine.

140
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:02,753
Fine.

141
00:55:08,132 --> 00:55:09,759
Are you sulking?

142
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:15,200
No, I'm not sulking.

143
00:55:18,209 --> 00:55:20,268
Yes, you are sulking.

144
00:55:31,055 --> 00:55:32,647
I love you.

145
00:55:49,473 --> 00:55:51,065
I want you.

146
00:55:54,078 --> 00:55:56,546
I want you too, my love.

147
00:55:59,283 --> 00:56:00,477
Shall we go?

148
00:56:04,021 --> 00:56:05,181
Let's go!

149
00:58:44,148 --> 00:58:46,275
- David, shall I lock it?
- Yes.

150
00:59:17,114 --> 00:59:18,308
Okay?

151
00:59:19,583 --> 00:59:21,210
It's stuck.

152
00:59:37,935 --> 00:59:39,061
Does it work?

153
00:59:44,475 --> 00:59:45,908
Shall we go?

154
00:59:47,278 --> 00:59:49,439
What do you put in your hair?

155
00:59:51,682 --> 00:59:53,115
I'm driving.

156
01:00:51,742 --> 01:00:54,074
Not too fast, I want to pee.

157
01:00:57,548 --> 01:00:58,572
Stop!

158
01:02:42,953 --> 01:02:45,217
You see, we're not alone.

159
01:03:15,452 --> 01:03:16,680
I know.

160
01:03:22,392 --> 01:03:23,484
I know!

161
01:03:25,929 --> 01:03:27,055
There...

162
01:03:35,906 --> 01:03:36,998
Can I?

163
01:06:52,269 --> 01:06:53,964
I don't understand.

164
01:06:55,706 --> 01:06:56,764
What is that?

165
01:07:00,978 --> 01:07:02,445
What does it mean?

166
01:07:21,932 --> 01:07:24,924
Maybe you should check the road.

167
01:07:31,174 --> 01:07:32,266
Okay?

168
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:37,940
Okay?

169
01:08:04,474 --> 01:08:06,169
Hey, a house.

170
01:08:24,127 --> 01:08:26,220
Look at the dogs! The dogs!

171
01:09:01,898 --> 01:09:03,297
Good dog.

172
01:09:03,867 --> 01:09:05,732
Good boy.

173
01:09:06,203 --> 01:09:08,137
You're a real dog.

174
01:09:36,566 --> 01:09:37,863
Shall we go?

175
01:09:39,703 --> 01:09:41,136
Look at him.

176
01:09:41,271 --> 01:09:42,397
Let's go.

177
01:10:17,474 --> 01:10:18,566
Come on!

178
01:10:21,478 --> 01:10:22,968
Come with me.

179
01:10:37,861 --> 01:10:38,953
Run, run...

180
01:10:46,102 --> 01:10:47,160
Stop!

181
01:10:47,537 --> 01:10:49,835
You hit the dog! Look!

182
01:10:50,941 --> 01:10:52,135
Oh, shit...

183
01:11:11,394 --> 01:11:13,760
Do something. 
Go on, do something!

184
01:11:16,132 --> 01:11:17,190
Call someone!

185
01:11:17,267 --> 01:11:18,359
Look...

186
01:11:18,435 --> 01:11:19,834
Call someone!

187
01:11:19,903 --> 01:11:21,165
Katia, look.

188
01:11:21,771 --> 01:11:23,261
Call someone!

189
01:11:25,942 --> 01:11:27,136
Call someone!

190
01:11:28,144 --> 01:11:30,112
Do something for the dog!

191
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:32,512
Do something now!

192
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:47,589
You don't give a damn! You don't care.
Do something, it's...

193
01:11:59,843 --> 01:12:01,071
You see!

194
01:12:29,973 --> 01:12:32,237
You don't give a damn.

195
01:12:38,782 --> 01:12:40,272
You don't.

196
01:12:43,687 --> 01:12:45,848
- You have no heart.
- That's not true!

197
01:12:52,162 --> 01:12:53,925
You almost killed him.

198
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:58,197
Nasty man!

199
01:13:16,119 --> 01:13:17,950
He was all black...

200
01:13:21,358 --> 01:13:23,349
with three legs.

201
01:13:38,975 --> 01:13:40,237
I'm coming...

202
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:22,240
My love.

203
01:16:56,873 --> 01:16:57,965
I'm splitting.

204
01:16:58,041 --> 01:16:59,269
Go ahead.

205
01:23:35,304 --> 01:23:36,999
Cut it out, Katia.

206
01:23:38,674 --> 01:23:40,266
Watch the car!

207
01:23:44,180 --> 01:23:46,114
You're not well.

208
01:23:47,850 --> 01:23:49,078
Fuck off!

209
01:23:52,688 --> 01:23:53,882
Stop!

210
01:23:58,260 --> 01:23:59,352
Stop!

211
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,741
They're crazy!

212
01:29:26,922 --> 01:29:28,480
It scares me.

213
01:29:28,724 --> 01:29:30,123
What does?

214
01:29:31,093 --> 01:29:32,560
I don't know. Shall we go?

215
01:29:32,628 --> 01:29:33,822
Yes.

216
01:33:44,012 --> 01:33:45,809
What are we going to do, David?

217
01:33:45,914 --> 01:33:47,142
I don't know.

218
01:33:51,219 --> 01:33:52,846
Shall we turn back?

219
01:33:53,689 --> 01:33:54,678
Where?

220
01:34:42,104 --> 01:34:43,628
I'll drive.

221
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:46,639
Guide me.

222
01:37:23,031 --> 01:37:24,555
He's crazy, David! Quick!

223
01:43:48,483 --> 01:43:50,383
We must call the police.

224
01:44:14,475 --> 01:44:15,806
I love you.

225
01:44:54,882 --> 01:44:56,509
You want to eat?
