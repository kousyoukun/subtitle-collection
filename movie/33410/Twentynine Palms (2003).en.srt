00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,468
Hello.

2
00:02:17,802 --> 00:02:19,861
Hello

3
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,732
I'm driving.

4
00:02:26,211 --> 00:02:28,611
Driving to Twenty-nine Palms.

5
00:02:31,182 --> 00:02:32,911
Yes.

6
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,148
I don't know,
It's gonna be a few days.

7
00:02:38,623 --> 00:02:40,488
I'll be back in a few days.

8
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:43,193
Good. Thank you.

9
00:02:45,363 --> 00:02:48,366
No, I'm gonna check out with
the location and the hotel.

10
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,459
I'll be right back.

11
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:57,967
Who is it?

12
00:02:59,944 --> 00:03:01,502
Michelle.

13
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:03,873
I didn't tell her I was coming.

14
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:09,211
Everything okay?

15
00:03:10,555 --> 00:03:11,920
Everything's fine...

16
00:03:12,457 --> 00:03:13,549
my love.

17
00:05:08,106 --> 00:05:09,130
Look!

18
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:07,519
It's great.
Listen.

19
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,890
It's fantastic.

20
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,595
No. It's perfect.

21
00:07:39,057 --> 00:07:41,389
Someday
I want to see you pee.

22
00:07:41,492 --> 00:07:42,459
No.

23
00:07:50,535 --> 00:07:53,231
Still not taking your photo?

24
00:07:53,604 --> 00:07:55,128
No.

25
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:15,312
What are you thinking?

26
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,812
I'm thinking nothing.

27
00:09:18,689 --> 00:09:20,589
You're thinking something.

28
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,353
Nothing.

29
00:09:24,095 --> 00:09:25,619
That's not true.

30
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,664
It's true!

31
00:09:32,503 --> 00:09:34,937
Why wouldn't you tell me?

32
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:46,516
I'm driving. What?

33
00:10:02,934 --> 00:10:04,026
What?

34
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:06,296
Katia!

35
00:10:10,107 --> 00:10:13,042
What did I say?
Come on.

36
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:14,429
What?
What? What?...

37
00:14:40,845 --> 00:14:42,107
You love me?

38
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:06,101
You have my penis?

39
00:15:11,308 --> 00:15:14,641
Put it inside.
- Put it inside.

40
00:15:33,397 --> 00:15:35,365
Put it inside.

41
00:16:01,492 --> 00:16:03,016
More, more!

42
00:16:44,368 --> 00:16:47,605
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

43
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,630
I feel it.

44
00:17:18,002 --> 00:17:19,970
What do you want for dinner?

45
00:17:21,672 --> 00:17:23,003
No idea.

46
00:17:28,912 --> 00:17:30,106
Chinese?

47
00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:34,982
Seen a place?

48
00:17:35,085 --> 00:17:36,052
Yes.

49
00:17:39,223 --> 00:17:40,588
Great.

50
00:17:51,935 --> 00:17:53,562
It's always the same.

51
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:54,865
Yeah.

52
00:18:02,246 --> 00:18:03,770
What's that?

53
00:18:04,982 --> 00:18:06,415
I don't know.

54
00:18:07,584 --> 00:18:07,879
I think...

55
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:09,919
is a art film.

56
00:18:12,823 --> 00:18:14,723
It's amazing.

57
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:42,380
There, I've finished.

58
00:19:08,278 --> 00:19:11,770
I can't find what this guy's eating
on the menu.

59
00:19:11,949 --> 00:19:13,917
Why don't you ask him?

60
00:19:14,685 --> 00:19:18,212
If you want I can find out on the menu
and then when she comes we order.

61
00:19:18,522 --> 00:19:20,683
Want me to do it?
I can go ask him.

62
00:19:20,891 --> 00:19:24,452
When she comes
I'll say I want one of that.

63
00:19:24,528 --> 00:19:25,586
Fine.

64
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:31,767
Would you like to place an order?

65
00:19:31,802 --> 00:19:37,707
Yes, please. I just.. one steam dumpling,
one steam dumpling.

66
00:19:38,142 --> 00:19:40,133
What's that guy eating?

67
00:19:40,244 --> 00:19:41,844
Thank you.

68
00:19:41,879 --> 00:19:45,747
Is easy, yes. What that is?

69
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,980
He has a Shim Foo Yang.

70
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:52,015
I'll take that.
- Okay.

71
00:19:52,189 --> 00:19:54,384
Anything else?
- No.

72
00:19:54,658 --> 00:19:58,094
Just split it in two for us.

73
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:05,394
Did I do something wrong?

74
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:08,333
She's upset.
We didn't order much. It's normal.

75
00:20:12,843 --> 00:20:15,403
Fresh soup. Thank you.

76
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,845
Are you happy to start scouting?

77
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:25,550
I'm happy...

78
00:20:26,657 --> 00:20:28,682
to be here...

79
00:20:29,426 --> 00:20:30,723
with you.

80
00:20:51,815 --> 00:20:53,043
Go on.

81
00:20:54,885 --> 00:20:56,045
You can go with her.

82
00:20:57,387 --> 00:20:58,820
You want me to go with her?

83
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:00,015
Go on.

84
00:21:01,391 --> 00:21:04,019
Because of what?
Why?

85
00:21:09,066 --> 00:21:11,500
Because I was looking at her?

86
00:21:18,675 --> 00:21:20,438
Ok.

87
00:21:22,112 --> 00:21:25,782
It pretty normal reaction for me to
look at someone that walk by.

88
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:29,582
Right? It's normal reaction for you
to look at people?

89
00:21:29,653 --> 00:21:31,712
So, it's nothing, right?

90
00:21:41,465 --> 00:21:43,558
I'm sorry.

91
00:21:44,401 --> 00:21:46,631
You want me to do now?

92
00:21:49,706 --> 00:21:53,540
I'm sorry. It's just kind of funny.

93
00:21:54,311 --> 00:21:56,438
I didn't mean to.

94
00:24:10,914 --> 00:24:15,180
where we go over and down,

95
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,012
go and see the whole plain...

96
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,661
where you like.

97
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,841
Now you see...

98
00:25:31,461 --> 00:25:32,428
Come on!

99
00:26:34,691 --> 00:26:35,783
You drive.

100
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:49,832
- Okay? -Yes.

101
00:26:52,776 --> 00:26:53,800
Go on.

102
00:26:55,445 --> 00:26:58,243
Can you tell me
where the brake is?

103
00:26:58,348 --> 00:27:00,043
The accelerator?

104
00:27:01,251 --> 00:27:02,650
You push here.

105
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,514
Wait...

106
00:27:10,427 --> 00:27:11,826
The brake. Push it.

107
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,889
Go.

108
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,262
Slowly, yes.

109
00:27:25,976 --> 00:27:27,443
Katia, slowly.

110
00:27:28,245 --> 00:27:29,507
Very good.

111
00:27:32,382 --> 00:27:33,349
Turn left.

112
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,021
Just don't move.

113
00:28:05,181 --> 00:28:06,512
Is it serious?

114
00:28:22,365 --> 00:28:25,300
maybe, ya...

115
00:28:27,871 --> 00:28:32,240
Maybe we get something
to fix it, like a...

116
00:28:34,644 --> 00:28:37,636
maybe we get wax.

117
00:28:54,397 --> 00:28:56,797
It's not funny.

118
00:29:41,678 --> 00:29:44,112
I'm sorry, I do stupid things.

119
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,913
You think it'll be okay?

120
00:29:51,688 --> 00:29:52,780
I'm sorry.

121
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:01,792
And it's not over, not yet.

122
00:30:01,931 --> 00:30:04,832
that way... that way...

123
00:30:05,702 --> 00:30:12,130
Stop... stop... turn left,
turn left... turn left..

124
00:30:18,081 --> 00:30:19,343
No.

125
00:30:21,217 --> 00:30:24,380
If you help me, you need to...
If I help you we don't need to go into the bushes.

126
00:30:26,122 --> 00:30:29,853
I'm sorry, if you want to help,
you need to help me properly.

127
00:30:32,996 --> 00:30:34,930
No, David, stop!

128
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:01,508
No.

129
00:32:01,851 --> 00:32:02,977
Why not?

130
00:32:03,086 --> 00:32:04,110
Not here.

131
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,748
Okay.

132
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:14,824
Let's go.

133
00:33:13,456 --> 00:33:15,117
I'm too dry, my love.

134
00:33:29,606 --> 00:33:31,335
Now it's gone.

135
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:21,777
Let's lie down.

136
00:35:27,924 --> 00:35:29,391
It hurts.

137
00:35:31,294 --> 00:35:32,454
My ass.

138
00:35:35,798 --> 00:35:37,698
You can lie on my feet.

139
00:35:55,485 --> 00:35:57,180
We're going to burn.

140
00:35:58,054 --> 00:35:59,419
Let's burn!

141
00:36:02,992 --> 00:36:04,391
Sheltered!

142
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,527
I'm burning.

143
00:37:16,966 --> 00:37:18,194
Me too.

144
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,850
It's beautiful here.

145
00:38:26,569 --> 00:38:27,831
Let's go.

146
00:38:29,538 --> 00:38:32,302
I don't want to go back.

147
00:38:34,911 --> 00:38:36,105
Let's go.

148
00:38:37,513 --> 00:38:39,981
I don't want to go back.

149
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,295
Please...

150
00:38:56,299 --> 00:38:57,493
Why?

151
00:38:59,902 --> 00:39:01,233
Because.

152
00:41:10,132 --> 00:41:11,463
You hear that?

153
00:41:14,403 --> 00:41:15,495
The storm...

154
00:41:16,939 --> 00:41:18,804
We have to leave.

155
00:41:19,975 --> 00:41:21,306
It's dangerous.

156
00:41:21,477 --> 00:41:23,308
No, that's not true.

157
00:41:23,779 --> 00:41:26,907
Absolutely not.
- It's not true.

158
00:41:53,509 --> 00:41:54,840
Oh, that's good.

159
00:41:57,546 --> 00:41:59,480
That's good.

160
00:42:15,364 --> 00:42:17,161
You're crazy!

161
00:42:35,251 --> 00:42:37,879
I didn't mean to do that, Catcha.

162
00:42:39,622 --> 00:42:40,816
I'm sorry.

163
00:43:32,041 --> 00:43:33,406
I'm sorry...

164
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:35,734
You hurt me.

165
00:45:56,018 --> 00:45:57,485
What's that?

166
00:45:58,587 --> 00:46:00,680
A father confessing to his wife...

167
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:03,918
that he has slept with
his daughter.

168
00:46:14,303 --> 00:46:15,702
The poor thing.

169
00:46:16,171 --> 00:46:17,160
Who?

170
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,734
The mother.

171
00:46:40,829 --> 00:46:42,956
You wouldn't do that?

172
00:46:43,332 --> 00:46:44,424
What?

173
00:46:45,267 --> 00:46:46,564
Are you crazy?

174
00:47:09,024 --> 00:47:10,753
What are we going to do?

175
00:47:11,827 --> 00:47:13,317
I don't know.

176
00:47:15,831 --> 00:47:17,059
I'm hungry.

177
00:47:17,666 --> 00:47:18,928
Already!

178
00:47:24,106 --> 00:47:25,266
All right.

179
00:47:29,611 --> 00:47:33,342
I have to go to the store
to get some polish.

180
00:47:33,715 --> 00:47:34,977
Great!

181
00:49:24,126 --> 00:49:27,721
Hey, you stupid ass, can you stay
out of the street? This is our street.

182
00:49:27,796 --> 00:49:31,926
Get out of way, get out of way.

183
00:50:45,974 --> 00:50:47,032
Found it?

184
00:50:47,209 --> 00:50:48,176
Yes.

185
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:50,878
I don't know which
one to get.

186
00:50:54,049 --> 00:50:57,041
- What did you buy?
- Cream for me.

187
00:51:00,088 --> 00:51:03,025
You know I bet that this has
similiar ingredients with that

188
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,358
and they called this a
different thing.

189
00:51:48,503 --> 00:51:50,334
Let's go there!

190
00:52:36,384 --> 00:52:37,851
I'm starving!

191
00:52:44,693 --> 00:52:46,820
Ice-cream?

192
00:52:53,969 --> 00:52:56,631
Two ice-cream, please.

193
00:52:56,738 --> 00:52:58,467
Hey, she's too tall.

194
00:53:00,509 --> 00:53:01,669
What?

195
00:53:04,646 --> 00:53:05,908
You think so?

196
00:53:06,014 --> 00:53:07,845
Don't you think so?

197
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:36,704
What?

198
00:53:39,381 --> 00:53:41,212
You wouldn't want me...

199
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:45,647
to shave my head like them?

200
00:53:46,822 --> 00:53:48,881
If you do, I'll...

201
00:53:50,225 --> 00:53:54,559
I think I can understand it better,
when yoou spoke french.

202
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,290
If you do...

203
00:54:01,937 --> 00:54:03,495
I'll leave you.

204
00:54:07,909 --> 00:54:09,843
You don't like Marines?

205
00:54:10,178 --> 00:54:12,806
I do! They're really handsome.

206
00:54:15,116 --> 00:54:16,640
So what?

207
00:54:16,785 --> 00:54:18,252
That's how it is.

208
00:54:26,061 --> 00:54:28,325
What are you talking about?

209
00:54:38,673 --> 00:54:39,935
Is it good?

210
00:54:41,843 --> 00:54:43,538
It's not good.

211
00:54:46,314 --> 00:54:47,804
But it's good.

212
00:54:49,484 --> 00:54:51,452
I don't know.

213
00:54:55,123 --> 00:54:56,886
I don't understand.

214
00:54:59,261 --> 00:55:01,661
You say things
I don't understand.

215
00:55:02,264 --> 00:55:04,732
There's nothing to understand.

216
00:55:07,435 --> 00:55:08,493
Fine.

217
00:55:10,672 --> 00:55:11,832
Fine.

218
00:55:17,245 --> 00:55:18,803
Are you sulking?

219
00:55:22,083 --> 00:55:24,278
No, I'm not sulking.

220
00:55:27,322 --> 00:55:29,313
Yes, you are sulking.

221
00:55:31,259 --> 00:55:34,261
You know I just like to have a conversation,
that have some sort of logic to it

222
00:55:34,296 --> 00:55:37,599
because sometimes you say one thing and then
you say something else and I have no idea what you say.

223
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:40,090
It just discomplete the function of the conversation.
- I don't know.

224
00:55:40,168 --> 00:55:41,692
I love you.

225
00:55:58,586 --> 00:56:00,110
I want you.

226
00:56:03,191 --> 00:56:05,625
I want you too, my love.

227
00:56:08,396 --> 00:56:09,522
Shall we go?

228
00:56:13,134 --> 00:56:14,226
Let's go!

229
00:58:53,261 --> 00:58:55,320
- David, shall I lock it?
- Yes.

230
00:59:26,227 --> 00:59:27,353
Okay?

231
00:59:28,696 --> 00:59:30,254
It's stuck.

232
00:59:30,999 --> 00:59:32,990
Just pull. Pull out.

233
00:59:47,048 --> 00:59:47,537
Does it work?

234
00:59:47,615 --> 00:59:49,640
Just a miracle.

235
00:59:53,588 --> 00:59:54,987
Shall we go?

236
00:59:56,391 --> 00:59:58,484
What do you put in your hair?

237
01:00:00,795 --> 01:00:02,194
I'm driving.

238
01:01:00,855 --> 01:01:03,119
Not too fast, I want to pee.

239
01:01:06,661 --> 01:01:07,628
Stop!

240
01:02:52,033 --> 01:02:54,263
You see, we're not alone.

241
01:02:59,307 --> 01:03:05,803
Want to drive?
You drive, go.

242
01:03:24,532 --> 01:03:25,726
I know.

243
01:03:30,905 --> 01:03:31,394
Put on break, put on break.

244
01:03:31,472 --> 01:03:32,530
I know!

245
01:03:35,009 --> 01:03:36,101
There...

246
01:03:44,986 --> 01:03:46,044
Can I?

247
01:03:47,889 --> 01:03:49,914
It's yours...

248
01:06:57,578 --> 01:07:00,672
794 thousands acres...

249
01:07:01,349 --> 01:07:03,010
I don't understand.

250
01:07:04,785 --> 01:07:05,683
What is that?

251
01:07:05,753 --> 01:07:09,314
794 thousands acres...

252
01:07:10,057 --> 01:07:11,490
What does it mean?

253
01:07:26,841 --> 01:07:30,174
I think it goes to 62...

254
01:07:31,012 --> 01:07:33,981
Maybe you should check the road.

255
01:07:40,254 --> 01:07:41,312
Okay?

256
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:46,986
Okay?

257
01:08:13,554 --> 01:08:15,181
Hey, a house.

258
01:08:33,207 --> 01:08:35,266
Look at the dogs!
The dogs!

259
01:09:10,978 --> 01:09:12,343
Good dog.

260
01:09:12,947 --> 01:09:14,778
Good boy.

261
01:09:15,282 --> 01:09:17,182
You're a real dog.

262
01:09:26,994 --> 01:09:29,929
I don't think they can understand
your french, honey.

263
01:09:45,646 --> 01:09:46,908
Shall we go?

264
01:09:48,783 --> 01:09:50,182
Look at him.

265
01:09:50,351 --> 01:09:51,443
Let's go.

266
01:10:26,554 --> 01:10:27,612
Come on!

267
01:10:30,558 --> 01:10:32,025
Come with me.

268
01:10:46,941 --> 01:10:47,999
Run, run...

269
01:10:55,182 --> 01:10:56,206
Stop!

270
01:10:56,617 --> 01:10:58,881
You hit the dog! Look!

271
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:01,180
Oh, shit...

272
01:11:16,904 --> 01:11:19,065
I couldn't even see the mirror.

273
01:11:20,474 --> 01:11:22,806
Do something.
Go on, do something!

274
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:25,078
What you want me to do?
There's nothing I can do.

275
01:11:25,212 --> 01:11:26,236
Call someone!

276
01:11:26,347 --> 01:11:27,405
Look...

277
01:11:27,514 --> 01:11:28,879
Call someone!

278
01:11:28,983 --> 01:11:30,211
Katia, look.

279
01:11:30,851 --> 01:11:32,318
Call someone!

280
01:11:33,454 --> 01:11:34,819
Look.

281
01:11:35,022 --> 01:11:36,182
Call someone!

282
01:11:37,224 --> 01:11:39,158
Do something for the dog!

283
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:41,353
Do something now!

284
01:11:41,428 --> 01:11:42,995
You know there nothing
I can do about the dog.

285
01:11:43,030 --> 01:11:45,658
Don't go on like that, because I can't
understand half things you're saying.

286
01:11:45,833 --> 01:11:49,503
If you want to talk to me a little bit,
I'll understand, I'll help you,

287
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:51,994
otherwise I can't be able to do
anything for you, ok?

288
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:56,635
You don't give a damn! You
don't care. Do something, it's...

289
01:12:04,919 --> 01:12:06,750
Look! Look!

290
01:12:08,923 --> 01:12:10,117
You see!

291
01:12:12,526 --> 01:12:14,892
See he's good, he's good.

292
01:12:19,099 --> 01:12:21,624
Oh, no, he's good.

293
01:12:39,053 --> 01:12:41,283
You don't give a damn.

294
01:12:47,861 --> 01:12:49,328
You don't.

295
01:12:50,931 --> 01:12:52,660
That not true, Katia,

296
01:12:52,766 --> 01:12:54,893
- You have no heart.
- That's not true!

297
01:13:01,241 --> 01:13:02,970
You almost killed him.

298
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:07,242
Nasty man!

299
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:26,996
He was all black...

300
01:13:30,437 --> 01:13:32,405
with three legs.

301
01:13:48,055 --> 01:13:49,283
I'm coming...

302
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:31,297
My love.

303
01:16:17,571 --> 01:16:19,334
Katia,

304
01:16:21,875 --> 01:16:23,900
open the door.

305
01:16:31,985 --> 01:16:33,885
Katia!

306
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:45,894
Katia, open the fucking door.

307
01:16:49,536 --> 01:16:51,572
If you want to keep the door closed,
you keep the door close.

308
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,572
I don't care to see you anymore.

309
01:16:53,607 --> 01:16:56,076
It's a matter of fact. I don't mind
to take you back to L.A.

310
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:57,809
I would never brought you here
in the first place.

311
01:16:57,844 --> 01:17:00,506
But you want to act like a
fucking princess.

312
01:17:02,182 --> 01:17:05,208
There's actually no reason
for you to be doing this.

313
01:17:05,953 --> 01:17:07,011
I'm splitting.

314
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,314
Go ahead.

315
01:17:12,192 --> 01:17:16,219
I don't the fuck I wanna
see your face again.

316
01:23:44,384 --> 01:23:46,045
Cut it out, Katia.

317
01:23:47,754 --> 01:23:49,312
Watch the car!

318
01:23:53,259 --> 01:23:55,159
You're not well.

319
01:23:56,930 --> 01:23:58,124
Fuck off!

320
01:24:01,768 --> 01:24:02,928
Stop!

321
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:08,398
Stop!

322
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:28,752
They're crazy!

323
01:29:36,002 --> 01:29:37,492
It scares me.

324
01:29:37,804 --> 01:29:39,169
What does?

325
01:29:40,173 --> 01:29:41,606
I don't know.
Shall we go?

326
01:29:41,708 --> 01:29:42,834
Yes.

327
01:33:53,092 --> 01:33:54,821
What are we going to do, David?

328
01:33:54,994 --> 01:33:56,154
I don't know.

329
01:34:00,299 --> 01:34:01,857
Shall we turn back?

330
01:34:02,768 --> 01:34:03,700
Where?

331
01:34:51,183 --> 01:34:52,650
I'll drive.

332
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:55,651
Guide me.

333
01:37:32,077 --> 01:37:33,567
He's crazy,
David! Quick!

334
01:38:09,448 --> 01:38:12,918
Come on, Come on. Get out
of here. Fuck off of me.

335
01:38:12,953 --> 01:38:16,979
Katia, Katia.
- Get the fuck off of me.

336
01:38:17,423 --> 01:38:21,951
Get off from me.
- Katia, Katia. -Get off from me.

337
01:43:57,529 --> 01:43:58,928
We must call the police.

338
01:43:58,997 --> 01:44:00,862
No.

339
01:44:23,522 --> 01:44:24,819
I love you.

340
01:45:03,929 --> 01:45:05,521
You want to eat?

341
01:47:01,847 --> 01:47:10,186
David.
- David

342
01:49:22,888 --> 01:49:26,119
No, I need somebody
up here now!

343
01:49:33,398 --> 01:49:37,835
2 units, i need 2 units here
immediately, now!

344
01:49:54,219 --> 01:49:56,687
Give me 2 unit immediately

345
01:50:11,203 --> 01:50:14,468
Yes, I'm asking you to help.

346
01:50:36,995 --> 01:50:41,694
There is no problem,
I need this staff immediately

347
01:50:46,805 --> 01:50:49,374
I can't believe we
have this conversation.

348
01:50:49,409 --> 01:50:52,400
Just get this staff right away.

349
01:50:56,648 --> 01:51:00,385
Get your ass over there,
stop fucking your wife!

350
01:51:00,420 --> 01:51:03,411
And get me somebody
else here now!
