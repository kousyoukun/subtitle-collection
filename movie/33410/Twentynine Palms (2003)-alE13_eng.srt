1
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,428
Who is it?

2
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,148
Everything okay?

3
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,068
Everything's fine...

4
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:15,820
my love.

5
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,357
Look!

6
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,448
It's fantastic.

7
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,100
No.

8
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,361
Still not taking your photo?

9
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,905
What are you thinking?

10
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,574
I'm thinking nothing.

11
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,410
You're thinking something.

12
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,246
Nothing.

13
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,749
That's not true.

14
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,046
It's true!

15
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,300
Why wouldn't you tell me?

16
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,664
What?

17
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,041
Katia!

18
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,579
You love me?

19
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,080
More, more!

20
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,201
What do you want for dinner?

21
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,413
No idea.

22
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,795
Chinese?

23
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,800
Seen a place?

24
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:15,051
Yes.

25
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,806
Great.

26
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,278
It's always the same.

27
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,571
Yeah.

28
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:43,997
What's that?

29
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,833
I don't know.

30
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,085
I think...

31
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,120
There, I've finished.

32
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,070
Why don't you ask him?

33
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,536
Want me to do it? I can go ask him.

34
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,374
Fine.

35
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,472
What's that guy eating?

36
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,835
She's upset. We didn't order much.
It's normal.

37
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,974
Are you happy to start scouting?

38
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,811
I'm happy

39
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:15,023
to be here

40
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,233
with you.

41
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:40,340
Go on.

42
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:43,551
You can go with her.

43
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:47,889
Go on.

44
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:31,756
Come on!

45
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:37,864
You drive.

46
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:52,587
- Okay?
- Yes.

47
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:56,632
Go on.

48
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:01,304
Can you tell me where the brake is?

49
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,264
The accelerator?

50
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:05,808
You push there.

51
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,852
Wait...

52
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:15,485
The brake. Push it.

53
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:21,783
Go.

54
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:26,412
Slowly, yes.

55
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,834
Katia, slowly.

56
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,878
Very good.

57
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:37,799
Turn left.

58
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,500
Is it serious?

59
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,227
I'm sorry, I do stupid things.

60
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,315
You think it'll be okay?

61
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,236
I'm sorry.

62
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,703
And it's not over, not yet.

63
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:42,066
I'm sorry, if you want to help,
you need to help me properly.

64
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:47,196
No, David, stop!

65
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,578
No.

66
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:18,913
Why not?

67
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:20,122
Not here.

68
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,001
Okay.

69
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,425
Let's go.

70
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,238
I'm too dry, my love.

71
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,370
Let's lie down.

72
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,295
It hurts.

73
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,548
My ass.

74
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,887
You can lie on my feet.

75
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,565
Yes.

76
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:23,240
We're going to burn.

77
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,659
Let's burn!

78
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,748
Sheltered!

79
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,947
I'm burning.

80
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,741
Me too.

81
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,562
It's beautiful here.

82
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,272
Let's go.

83
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:05,027
I don't want to go back.

84
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:08,947
Let's go.

85
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,910
I don't want to go back.

86
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:29,051
Please...

87
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,220
Why?

88
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:35,140
Because.

89
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:50,901
You hear that?

90
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,155
The storm...

91
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,575
We have to leave.

92
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,245
It's dangerous.

93
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:03,455
No, that's not true.

94
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,113
Oh, that's good.

95
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:59,469
You're crazy!

96
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,202
I'm sorry.

97
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,882
I'm sorry...

98
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:21,426
You hurt me.

99
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,115
What's that?

100
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:52,577
A father confessing to his wife

101
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:55,413
that he has slept with their daughter.

102
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,260
The poor thing.

103
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,803
Who?

104
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:12,389
The mother.

105
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,538
You wouldn't do that?

106
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:38,123
What?

107
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:40,292
Are you crazy?

108
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:05,567
What are we going to do?

109
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:08,278
I don't know.

110
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,282
I'm hungry.

111
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,117
Already!

112
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,665
All right.

113
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:30,967
Great!

114
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,042
Found it?

115
00:52:51,252 --> 00:52:52,293
Yes.

116
00:52:52,545 --> 00:52:55,004
I don't know which one to get.

117
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:01,469
- What did you buy?
- Cream for me.

118
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,066
Let's go there!

119
00:54:45,074 --> 00:54:46,699
I'm starving!

120
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:08,096
Hey, she's too tall.

121
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,391
What?

122
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:15,645
You think so?

123
00:55:16,105 --> 00:55:17,814
Don't you think so?

124
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:47,844
What?

125
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:52,640
You wouldn't want me

126
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:57,353
to shave my head like them?

127
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:00,690
If you do, I'll...

128
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:12,577
If you do...

129
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:15,955
I'll leave you.

130
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,587
You don't like Marines?

131
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:25,548
I do! They're really handsome.

132
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:31,387
That's how it is.

133
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:41,814
What are you talking about?

134
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:53,910
Is it good?

135
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:57,580
It's not good.

136
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:02,085
But it's good.

137
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,552
I don't understand.

138
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:16,265
You say things I don't understand.

139
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:19,727
There's nothing to understand.

140
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:23,815
Fine.

141
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,110
Fine.

142
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,450
Are you sulking?

143
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:40,081
No, I'm not sulking.

144
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:45,294
Yes, you are sulking.

145
00:57:56,765 --> 00:57:58,307
I love you.

146
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:17,618
I want you.

147
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:23,291
I want you too, my love.

148
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,378
Shall we go?

149
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,175
Let's go!

150
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:20,176
- David, shall I lock it?
- Yes.

151
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:53,584
Okay?

152
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:56,670
It's stuck.

153
01:02:14,106 --> 01:02:15,147
Does it work?

154
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,279
Shall we go?

155
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:26,075
What do you put in your hair?

156
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:29,829
I'm driving.

157
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:33,517
Not too fast, I want to pee.

158
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:38,063
Stop!

159
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,425
You see, we're not alone.

160
01:06:00,999 --> 01:06:02,249
I know.

161
01:06:08,256 --> 01:06:09,381
I know!

162
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:13,010
There...

163
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:23,437
Can I?

164
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:48,684
I don't understand.

165
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:51,562
What is that?

166
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:57,526
What does it mean?

167
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,966
Maybe you should check the road.

168
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:28,682
Okay?

169
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:34,521
Okay?

170
01:11:02,342 --> 01:11:04,051
Hey, a house.

171
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:25,072
Look at the dogs! The dogs!

172
01:12:02,193 --> 01:12:03,568
Good dog.

173
01:12:04,237 --> 01:12:06,113
Good boy.

174
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:08,615
You're a real dog.

175
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:39,730
Shall we go?

176
01:12:41,649 --> 01:12:43,108
Look at him.

177
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:44,359
Let's go.

178
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:22,064
Come on!

179
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:26,610
Come with me.

180
01:13:42,085 --> 01:13:43,293
Run, run...

181
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:51,510
Stop!

182
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:54,554
You hit the dog! Look!

183
01:13:55,723 --> 01:13:56,932
Oh, shit...

184
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:19,371
Do something.
Go on, do something!

185
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:23,083
Call someone!

186
01:14:23,251 --> 01:14:24,376
Look...

187
01:14:24,544 --> 01:14:25,794
Call someone!

188
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:27,254
Katia, look.

189
01:14:27,839 --> 01:14:29,422
Call someone!

190
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:33,301
Call someone!

191
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:36,555
Do something for the dog!

192
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:38,974
Do something now!

193
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:54,865
You don't give a damn! You don't care.
Do something, it's...

194
01:15:07,628 --> 01:15:08,837
You see!

195
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:41,369
You don't give a damn.

196
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:49,252
You don't.

197
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:55,550
- You have no heart.
- That's not true!

198
01:16:02,225 --> 01:16:04,017
You almost killed him.

199
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:08,521
Nasty man!

200
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:29,042
He was all black...

201
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:34,714
with three legs.

202
01:16:51,065 --> 01:16:52,190
I'm coming...

203
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:36,026
My love.

204
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:18,313
I'm splitting.

205
01:20:18,481 --> 01:20:19,731
Go ahead.

206
01:27:12,769 --> 01:27:14,478
Cut it out, Katia.

207
01:27:16,148 --> 01:27:17,982
Watch the car!

208
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:23,988
You're not well.

209
01:27:25,866 --> 01:27:27,033
Fuck off!

210
01:27:30,871 --> 01:27:32,121
Stop!

211
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:37,919
Stop!

212
01:33:10,627 --> 01:33:11,794
They're crazy!

213
01:33:19,469 --> 01:33:21,136
It scares me.

214
01:33:21,304 --> 01:33:22,846
What does?

215
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:25,391
I don't know. Shall we go?

216
01:33:25,558 --> 01:33:26,767
Yes.

217
01:37:47,529 --> 01:37:49,404
What are we going to do, David?

218
01:37:49,572 --> 01:37:50,864
I don't know.

219
01:37:55,161 --> 01:37:56,662
Shall we turn back?

220
01:37:57,455 --> 01:37:58,622
Where?

221
01:38:48,298 --> 01:38:49,715
I'll drive.

222
01:38:51,426 --> 01:38:52,843
Guide me.

223
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,507
He's crazy, David! Quick!

224
01:48:17,783 --> 01:48:19,659
We must call the police.

225
01:48:44,894 --> 01:48:46,477
I love you.

226
01:49:27,144 --> 01:49:28,811
You want to eat?

227
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:51,749
