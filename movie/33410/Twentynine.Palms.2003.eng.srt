1
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:18,512
I'm driving.

2
00:02:21,513 --> 00:02:23,513
I'm going to Twentynine Palms.

3
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:27,514
Yes.

4
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:33,515
I do not know.
I'll  be just a few days.

5
00:02:33,616 --> 00:02:35,516
Back in a few days.

6
00:02:36,517 --> 00:02:37,517
Good. Thank you.

7
00:02:40,518 --> 00:02:43,518
No, I will set up places, the hotel,

8
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,519
And go back again.

9
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,714
Who was he?

10
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:59,919
No I said  I would.

11
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,955
All right?

12
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,753
All is well ...

13
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,429
My love.

14
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,035
Look!

15
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,159
It's great.

16
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:02,159
Listen.

17
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,673
It's fantastic.

18
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:15,239
It's perfect.

19
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:36,239
Someday, I'd like  to see you pee.

20
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,229
No..

21
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,033
You're not even echo the picture?

22
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,072
What do you think?

23
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,632
Do not think of anything.

24
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,357
Are you thinking something.

25
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,108
No nothing.

26
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,478
Not true.

27
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,559
It's true.

28
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,629
Why do not you tell me?

29
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,679
I'm driving. What?

30
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,749
What?

31
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,035
Katia!

32
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,638
What do I say?
Come ...

33
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:08,639
What? What?

34
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,789
Do you love me?

35
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,790
Hold me tap.

36
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,791
Do you like  my penis?

37
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:07,999
Put it inside.

38
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Put it ...

39
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:18,001
Open  up.

40
00:15:28,002 --> 00:15:29,002
Put it in!

41
00:15:53,003 --> 00:15:54,999
Do you feel  my penis?

42
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,833
More,more!

43
00:16:01,834 --> 00:16:03,834
Katia!

44
00:16:39,835 --> 00:16:41,835
Do you feel it?

45
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,836
Sorry! Sorry!

46
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,677
What do you eat?

47
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,759
Do not  know.

48
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,835
Chinese?

49
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,634
Do you know  any site?

50
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,829
Yes.

51
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,394
Good.

52
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,199
It's always  the same.

53
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,475
Yes.

54
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,519
What is  that?

55
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,233
Do not  know.

56
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,395
I think it's ...

57
00:18:03,396 --> 00:18:04,396
An art  film.

58
00:18:07,397 --> 00:18:09,397
It's amazing.

59
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,998
Come on, I'm done.

60
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,679
I want  that.

61
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,580
I can not find in the letter what is
Eating man.

62
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,591
Why do not  you ask?

63
00:19:09,592 --> 00:19:12,592
As you wish, but I can find
And ask the waitress.

64
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,396
Want me to do it?
I can go and ask.

65
00:19:15,397 --> 00:19:18,397
When the waitress comes, I will tell
what we want, and we share.

66
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,389
Whatever.

67
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:29,390
- Are you going to ask?
- Yes please.

68
00:19:29,391 --> 00:19:31,391
A vapeur menu.

69
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,876
What do you eat this man?

70
00:19:35,877 --> 00:19:36,877
Thanks.

71
00:19:36,878 --> 00:19:37,878
Is it easy eh?

72
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,879
That there.
Can you tell me who is that?

73
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,880
Shrimp Foo-yong.

74
00:19:44,881 --> 00:19:46,881
I'll take that.

75
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:48,882
- Anything else?
- No.

76
00:19:50,883 --> 00:19:51,883
We share it.

77
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:00,359
Did I miss something wrong?

78
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,999
The bartender is disgusted by that
We have asked recently. It's normal.

79
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
- Shrimp.
- Thanks.

80
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,595
Are you happy to start the exploration?

81
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,278
I am happy ...

82
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,356
To be here ...

83
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,479
You.

84
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,635
Come.

85
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,769
You can go  with it.

86
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,670
Want me to go with it?

87
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,869
Go..

88
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,515
Why?

89
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,678
Why watch it?

90
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,555
Want  ...

91
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,316
It's a normal reaction to look  at the people
happens to me.

92
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,393
It's normal to look at people.

93
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,233
But it means nothing

94
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,675
I'm sorry.

95
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,476
What can  I say?

96
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,475
Sorry, it is ridiculous ...

97
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,912
I did not  want ...

98
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,157
When we begin to go down ...

99
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,272
We will see a great ...

100
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,359
Plain  ...

101
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,558
The Joshua Tree!

102
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,278
You'll like it.

103
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,753
Look  ...

104
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,316
Come!

105
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,509
It leads you.

106
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,638
- Well?
- Yes.

107
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,609
Let's  go.

108
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,999
Can you tell me which is the brake
and as is the accelerator?

109
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,314
You tread there.

110
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,274
Wait  ...

111
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,599
The brake. Pisa there.

112
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,730
Let's  go.

113
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,078
Slow down.

114
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,273
Katia, slowly.

115
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,228
Okay.

116
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,196
Turn left.

117
00:27:30,997 --> 00:27:32,997
You are going to scratch the car.

118
00:27:37,998 --> 00:27:38,998
Please ...

119
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:43,999
Do not  move.

120
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Shit.

121
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,274
Is it serious?

122
00:28:17,275 --> 00:28:18,275
Maybe  ...

123
00:28:18,276 --> 00:28:19,276
Yes, it worked.

124
00:28:22,277 --> 00:28:26,277
I think we can do something
to fix ...

125
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:31,278
Perhaps if we found some rocks.

126
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:44,279
Not that you laugh.

127
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,280
It's no fun!

128
00:28:53,281 --> 00:28:55,281
It's my fault, but it is fun.

129
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:04,282
No, fine.

130
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,829
Forgive me for a fool.

131
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,717
Do you think  this right?

132
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,475
Sorry.

133
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,558
And that has not yet finished.

134
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:59,559
Over there, over there.

135
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,560
To.
To the left!

136
00:30:04,561 --> 00:30:05,561
To the left  ... Left!

137
00:30:16,562 --> 00:30:17,562
If you help me ...

138
00:30:17,563 --> 00:30:19,563
If I help you, you may not hit
shrubs.

139
00:30:20,364 --> 00:30:21,364
Over there!

140
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,714
Sorry, if you want to help,
will have to help either.

141
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,637
No, David, still.
Para.

142
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,595
Why not?

143
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,855
Please.

144
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,569
Well.

145
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,589
Let's  go.

146
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,590
Spread your legs.

147
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,793
I am very dry, my love.

148
00:33:18,794 --> 00:33:21,794
I have bad feet.

149
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,795
Let's  go.

150
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,549
We're going to lie down.

151
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,153
It hurts.

152
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,274
Oh, my  ass.

153
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,397
You can lie down on my foot.

154
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,595
Yes.

155
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,912
We're going to burn.

156
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,233
Quemémonos!

157
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,119
Well wrapped!

158
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,274
I'm burning.

159
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,954
I..

160
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,599
It's nice here.

161
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,509
Let's  go.

162
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,079
I do not want.

163
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,829
Let's  go.

164
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,635
I do not want.

165
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,113
Please ...

166
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,189
Why?

167
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,948
Why yes.

168
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,154
You hear that?

169
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,235
A thunder ...

170
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,512
We gotta go.

171
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,068
It's dangerous.

172
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,197
No, not  true.

173
00:41:18,198 --> 00:41:20,198
No way.

174
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:22,199
Not true.

175
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,514
OH, than good.

176
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,912
You're crazy.

177
00:42:30,013 --> 00:42:32,913
It was not wanting, Katia.

178
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,634
Sorry.

179
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,068
Sorry  ...

180
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,519
I've echo  damage.

181
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,154
What is  that?

182
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,470
A father confesses to his wife ...

183
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,719
Who has slept with his daughter.

184
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,519
That poor.

185
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,089
Who?

186
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,474
The mother.

187
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,631
You'd do that?

188
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,155
What?

189
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,229
Are you  crazy?

190
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,478
What can  we do?

191
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,079
Do not  know.

192
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:11,914
I have hunger.

193
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,669
Ya!!

194
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,955
Okay.

195
00:47:24,956 --> 00:47:27,956
I'm going to  buy polish.

196
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,833
Well done!

197
00:49:19,834 --> 00:49:20,834
Stupid!

198
00:49:20,835 --> 00:49:22,835
Outside of the street!
This street is ours!

199
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:25,836
Out of  here!

200
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,815
Do you  feel?

201
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,915
Yes.

202
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,509
But that does not catch.

203
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,718
- #;And you who have bought?
- Cream to me.

204
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:58,719
Sure it's the same product,

205
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,720
But with different names.

206
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,038
Come here.

207
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,633
I'm starving?

208
00:52:37,034 --> 00:52:38,634
A cold.

209
00:52:39,635 --> 00:52:40,635
A cold?

210
00:52:48,636 --> 00:52:50,136
Two ice  cream.

211
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,152
Hey, she's great.

212
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,315
What?

213
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,389
You think?

214
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,472
And what do  you think?

215
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,275
What?

216
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,878
Would you like to ...

217
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,397
... Shave my head like that?

218
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,591
If you want, I ...

219
00:53:45,592 --> 00:53:49,592
I think I understand better
if the words.

220
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:54,993
If you want ...

221
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,238
I'll leave you.

222
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,591
Do not you like the Marines?

223
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,428
Yes, of course! They are beautiful.

224
00:54:09,429 --> 00:54:11,429
So what?

225
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,039
They are.

226
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,030
#But you're saying?

227
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,634
Is this  good?

228
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,159
Is not this good?

229
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,473
But is this right?

230
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,552
I do not understand.

231
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,156
You say things that  do not understand.

232
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,395
There is nothing  to understand.

233
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,309
Well.

234
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,475
Well.

235
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,999
Are you sulking?

236
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,916
No, I'm not angry.

237
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,917
Yes, those sulky.

238
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:29,518
I wish that our conversations
had some logic.

239
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:32,519
Because sometimes you say something,, I say otherwise
and not to talk.

240
00:55:32,959 --> 00:55:34,959
Talks are meaningless ...

241
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,393
I love  you.

242
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,918
I love  you.

243
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,349
And I to you, my love.

244
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,269
Are we going?

245
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,869
Let's  go!

246
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:34,870
Here comes ...

247
00:57:38,871 --> 00:57:40,871
Here comes ...

248
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,296
- David, do you lock?
- Yes.

249
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,035
What happpens?

250
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,999
This hard.

251
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Pull yourself.

252
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,715
Does it  work?

253
00:59:43,716 --> 00:59:45,716
It is miraculous.

254
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,554
Are we going?

255
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,190
What you're lying in your hair?

256
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:56,788
I drive.

257
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,875
Not so fast, I  have to pee.

258
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:02,430
Stop!

259
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:49,035
See how we are not alone.

260
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:56,036
Want to  drive?

261
01:02:58,037 --> 01:03:00,037
Drive.

262
01:03:00,038 --> 01:03:01,038
Come.

263
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:20,509
I know..Pisa

264
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:27,355
- brake.
- I know.

265
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:30,835
Now is ...

266
01:03:31,836 --> 01:03:33,836
Perfect.

267
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:40,829
I can?

268
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:44,830
It's all  yours.

269
01:06:52,119 --> 01:06:55,119
794 000 hectares.

270
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:57,678
I do not understand.

271
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:00,436
What is  that?

272
01:07:00,437 --> 01:07:02,437
794 000 hectares!

273
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:06,159
What does that mean?

274
01:07:21,879 --> 01:07:25,879
I think this road  leads to the 62.

275
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:28,633
Perhaps you should check the road.

276
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,029
Well?

277
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:39,939
Here.

278
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,629
Well?

279
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:10,032
Hey, a  home.

280
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,116
Watch the dogs!
Dogs!

281
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,034
Good dog.

282
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,472
Good boy.

283
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:11,871
You're a real dog.

284
01:09:22,072 --> 01:09:25,872
I do not think you understand French
affection.

285
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:41,709
Are we going?

286
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,953
Look.

287
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:46,149
Come  go.

288
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:22,315
Let's  go.

289
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:26,668
Come with me.

290
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:42,675
Run, run ...

291
01:10:42,676 --> 01:10:44,676
I can not see in the mirror.Care

292
01:10:48,919 --> 01:10:49,919
eh ....

293
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:50,870
Stop!

294
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,590
You have stepped on the dog!
Look!

295
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:55,875
Shit  ...

296
01:11:11,239 --> 01:11:15,239
I did not see in the mirror!

297
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:17,390
Do something. Come  on, do something!

298
01:11:18,391 --> 01:11:19,999
What do you want? I can not
do anything.

299
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,055
Call someone!

300
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,195
Look. Okay.

301
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:23,549
Call someone!

302
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:24,954
Katia.  Mira.

303
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:27,039
Call someone!

304
01:11:28,339 --> 01:11:29,339
Look!

305
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:30,950
Call someone!

306
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,871
Do something for the dog!

307
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,196
Do something for once!

308
01:11:36,197 --> 01:11:39,197
I can not do anything, do not understand
mita or the things you say.

309
01:11:40,198 --> 01:11:44,198
If you feel better, then, perhaps
can help.

310
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:47,199
But I can not do anything for you.

311
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:51,435
You do not do anything! I do not care
Do something, is ...

312
01:11:56,436 --> 01:11:58,436
Doggy  ...

313
01:11:59,437 --> 01:12:01,437
Look!

314
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:04,835
You see!

315
01:12:07,836 --> 01:12:09,836
Look, fine.

316
01:12:14,837 --> 01:12:16,837
Okay.

317
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:36,030
You've done nothing.

318
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:43,689
You have not done anything.

319
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,599
Not true!

320
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,636
- Do not have a heart.
- You know you're wrong.

321
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,752
Almost kill him.

322
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,074
Male disggusting!

323
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:21,757
It was all  black ...

324
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:27,191
With three  legs ...

325
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:43,955
I'm leaving ...

326
01:14:01,639 --> 01:14:03,639
There you go!

327
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:25,993
My love.

328
01:16:16,759 --> 01:16:18,759
Open the door.

329
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,760
Open the fucking door.

330
01:16:44,061 --> 01:16:48,761
If you're not going to open? Do not open.
We no longer see more.

331
01:16:48,762 --> 01:16:52,562
I'll take back to Los Angeles.
We should not have come here ever.

332
01:16:52,663 --> 01:16:55,663
Did you know that you behave as
Princess a whore!

333
01:16:57,164 --> 01:16:59,164
There is no reason  for
to do this.

334
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:01,736
I'm out.

335
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:02,995
Go..

336
01:17:07,996 --> 01:17:09,996
I never want to  see your face!

337
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:40,752
Come here,, Katia.

338
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,118
Beware! The car!

339
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:49,877
You are not good, Katia.

340
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:52,789
Fuck you!

341
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:57,669
Stop!

342
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:03,235
Stop!

343
01:24:30,236 --> 01:24:32,236
I hate you! I hate  you! I hate you!

344
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,439
They're  crazy!

345
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,398
I have  fear.

346
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,033
What?

347
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,473
Do not know. Shall we go?

348
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:37,795
Yes.

349
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:49,672
What can we  do, David?

350
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:51,074
Do not  know.

351
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:56,632
Do we turn?

352
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:58,509
Where?

353
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:47,518
I drive.

354
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:50,519
Make  me.

355
01:37:18,079 --> 01:37:21,879
Oh god, I turn  away dammit!

356
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,438
David 's crazy!
Go!

357
01:37:29,439 --> 01:37:30,439
I can not go faster!

358
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:08,440
Away from me, asshole!

359
01:38:10,441 --> 01:38:11,441
Let me, motherfucker!

360
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:54,112
We have to call the police.

361
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:19,839
I love  you.

362
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,438
Are we going to  eat something?

363
01:52:50,880 --> 01:53:00,438
