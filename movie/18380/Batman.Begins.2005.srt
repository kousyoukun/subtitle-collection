1
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:25,950

2
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,410
瑞秋，给我看
Rachel, let me see.

3
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,230
- 借我看看 - 谁找到就是谁的，这是我找到的
- Can I see? - Finders keepers. And I found it.

4
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,800
这是我家的花园
In my garden.

5
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,210
谁找到就是谁的
Finders keepers.

6
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,820
布鲁斯？
Bruce?

7
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,300
布鲁斯！
Bruce?

8
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,910
妈！ 阿福！
Mom! Mr. Alfred!

9
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,280
你又在做梦吗？
Did you have dream?

10
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,510
可怕的恶梦
Nightmare.

11
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,100
比这地方更可怕？
Worse than this place?

12
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,600
他们要跟你干架
They are going to fight you.

13
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,530
- 又要干架？ - 不打死你绝不罢休
- Again? - Until they kill you.

14
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,880
那就在吃早餐前打死我吧
Can they kill me before breakfast?

15
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,320
臭小子，你活在地狱
You are in hell, little man.

16
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,140
而我就是魔王
And I am the devil.

17
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,730
你不是魔王
You're not the devil.

18
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,190
你是我的沙包
You're practice.

19
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,230
关到禁闭室
Solitary.

20
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,240
- 为什么？ - 为了保护
- Why? - For protection.

21
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,170
- 我才不需要保护 - 保护他们不被你打死
- I don't need protection. - Protection for them.

22
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,590
进去
Get in.

23
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,390
你这么想打击罪犯…
Are you so desperate to fight criminals...

24
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,100
不惜入狱和他们单挑？
...that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time?

25
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:56,120
其实我一共有七个对手
Actually, there were seven of them.

26
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,420
我只算到有六个，韦恩先生
I counted six, Mr. Wayne.

27
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,920
你怎么知道我的名字？
How do you know my name?

28
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,230
布鲁斯韦恩仍是个大人物
The world is too small for someone like Bruce Wayne to disappear...

29
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,710
不管你有多么落魄潦倒
...no matter how deep he chooses to sink.

30
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,950
你是谁？
Who are you?

31
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,380
敝姓杜卡 我是忍者大师的代言人
My name is merely Ducard, but I speak for Ra's al Ghul...

32
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,200
他是犯罪集团的克星
...a man greatly feared by the criminal underworld.

33
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,880
他可以指引你一条明路
A man who can offer you a path.

34
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,320
你凭什么认为我需要指引？
What makes you think I need a path?

35
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,330
你这种人是自愿来这种地方
Someone like you is only here by choice.

36
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,860
你想深入了解罪犯的世界
You have been exploring the criminal fraternity...

37
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,500
不管你的目的是什么
...but whatever your original intentions...

38
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,610
你已经迷失了方向
...you have become truly lost.

39
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,930
忍者大师能指引我走哪条路？
And what path can Ra's al Ghul offer?

40
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,100
你和他一样痛恨邪恶力量
The path of a man who shares his hatred of evil...

41
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,480
你也希望能伸张正义
...and wishes to serve true justice.

42
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,000
也就是影武者联盟之路
The path of the League of Shadows.

43
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,380
- 你们是以暴制暴的私刑者 - 并不是
- You're vigilantes. - No, no, no.

44
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:00,820
在你争我夺之中失利的人 才会变成以暴制暴的私刑者
A vigilante is just a man lost in the scramble for his own gratification.

45
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,640
他们会被击毁或遭囚禁
He can be destroyed or locked up.

46
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,810
但是…如果你能够超越自我极限
But if you make yourself more than just a man...

47
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,930
为一个崇高理想全心投入
...if you devote yourself to an ideal...

48
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,570
他们就无法阻止你
...and if they can't stop you...

49
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,410
你也将成为另一种人
...then you become something else entirely.

50
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,600
什么人？
Which is?

51
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,140
传奇英雄，韦恩先生
Legend, Mr. Wayne.

52
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,010
明天你将被释放
Tomorrow, you will be released.

53
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,660
如果你想打击更凶狠的罪犯
If you are bored of brawling with thieves and want to achieve something...

54
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,290
东边的山坡有一种罕见的蓝花
...there is a rare blue flower that grows on the eastern slopes.

55
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,090
摘下一朵蓝花
Pick one of these flowers.

56
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,290
如果你能把它带到山巅
If you can carry it to the top of the mountain...

57
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,240
也许就能找到你当初在寻找的东西
...you may find what you were looking for in the first place.

58
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,250
我在寻找什么？
And what was I looking for?

59
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,880
只有你自己知道
Only you can know that.

60
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,710
回去，你一定要回头
You turn back. You go back.

61
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,250
忍者大师？
Ra's al Ghul?

62
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,020
且慢
Wait.

63
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,320
你在寻找什么？
What are you seeking?

64
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,280
我在寻找…
I seek...

65
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,100
打击犯罪、伸张正义的方法
...the means to fight injustice.

66
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,550
让制造恐惧的恶徒…
To turn fear...

67
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,790
心生恐惧
...against those who prey on the fearful.

68
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,550
你要让别人心生恐惧
To manipulate the fears in others...

69
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,850
就必须先战胜自己内心的恐惧
...you must first master your own.

70
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,110
你准备开战了吗？
Are you ready to begin?

71
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,610
我连站都站不起来
I can... I can barely stand.

72
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,140
死神不会等你准备好
Death does not wait for you to be ready!

73
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,470
死神绝不手下留情！
Death is not considerate or fair!

74
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,670
你面对死神吧，不容有失
And make no mistake, here you face death.

75
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,780
虎爪
Tiger.

76
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,200
柔术
Jujitsu.

77
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,430
豹掌
Panther.

78
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,290
身手不错，但这不是儿戏
You're skilled. But this is not a dance.

79
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,290
而且你仍然害怕
And you are afraid.

80
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,120
但不是怕我
But not of me.

81
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,110
告诉我，韦恩先生
Tell us, Mr. Wayne...

82
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,810
你害怕什么？
...what do you fear?

83
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,320
布鲁斯？
Bruce?

84
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,490
没事了，没事了
It's okay. It's okay.

85
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,120
你不会有事的
You'll be okay.

86
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,730
老爷，我要叫救护车吗？
Will we be needing an ambulance, Master Wayne?

87
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,920
我先替他接骨，待会再照Ｘ光
No, I'll set the bone and take him for an x-ray later.

88
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,250
好的，老爷
Very good, sir.

89
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,530
- 对不起，老爷 - 别担心，他没事
- I'm very sorry, sir. I've told... -Don't worry. It's fine.

90
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,730
你跌得很惨，对吧，少爷？
Took quite a fall, didn't we, Master Bruce?

91
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,170
我们为什么跌倒，布鲁斯？
And why do we fall?

92
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,640
这样才能学会站起来
So we can learn to pick ourselves up.

93
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,280
只是小跌了一下，轻微骨折而已
Just a little fall. It's just a small fracture.

94
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,010
你又想到那些蝙蝠？
The bats again?

95
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,320
你知道牠们为什么攻击你吗？
You know why they attacked you, don't you?

96
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,930
- 因为牠们怕你 - 牠们怕我？
- They were afraid of you. - Afraid of me?

97
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,030
每种生物都有恐惧
All creatures feel fear.

98
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,530
就连可怕的怪物也有？
Even the scary ones?

99
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,590
尤其是可怕的怪物
Especially the scary ones.

100
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,750
我给你看样东西
I got something to show you.

101
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,420
- 你想你妈会喜欢吗？ - 当然会
- You think your mother will like them? - Yeah.

102
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,240
- 你该起床了吧？ - 好啦
- I think it's time to get up. - Maybe.

103
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,980
不准赖床
No going back to bed.

104
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,340
爸，高架铁路是你盖的吗？
Did you build this train, Dad?

105
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:43,300
高谭市对韦恩家族很好 但这城市日渐没落
Gotham's been good to our family, but the city's been suffering.

106
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,980
小老百姓的日子过得很辛苦
People less fortunate than us have been enduring very hard times.

107
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,110
於是我们建造经济的大众交通工具 把全体市民连结在一起
So we built a new, cheap, public transportation system to unite the city.

108
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,880
正中央就是…
And at the center...

109
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,880
韦恩大楼
...Wayne Tower.

110
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,000
- 你在那里上班吗？ - 不，我在医院工作
Is that where you work? - No, I work at the hospital.

111
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,380
我把公司交给更好的人管理
I leave the running of our company to much better men.

112
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,360
- 比你更好的人？ - 嗯…
- Better? - Well...

113
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,810
比我对做生意更有兴趣的人
...more interested men.

114
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,560
我们可以走吗？
Can we go?

115
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,420
拜托
Please.

116
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,080
好，我们走吧
Okay. Let's go.

117
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,240
- 布鲁斯，你怎么了？ - 不是他，是我
- What's wrong, Bruce? - No, no. It was me.

118
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,470
是我想要出来透透气
I just needed some fresh air.

119
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,890
歌剧听久了很累人，对吧？
A little bit of opera goes a long way. Right, Bruce?

120
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,200
我们回家吧
Come on. Let's go.

121
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,370
皮夹和珠宝，快点
Wallets, jewelry. Come on, fast.

122
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,890
- 没问题 - 快点
-That's fine. -Fast.

123
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,630
别紧张
Take it easy.

124
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,860
别冲动
Take it easy.

125
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,100
拿去吧
Here you go.

126
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,760
没关系，没关系
It's fine. It's fine.

127
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:57,770
把皮夹拿去，放过我们
Now just take it and go.

128
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,690
- 我要那串珍珠项链 - 喂…
- I said, jewelry. -Hey...

129
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,040
汤玛斯！
Thomas!

130
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,650
布鲁斯
Bruce.

131
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,690
没关系
It's okay.

132
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,570
不要害怕
Don't be afraid.

133
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,170
那是你父亲的大衣吗？
Is this your father's?

134
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,850
没关系
It's okay.

135
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,660
过来
Come here.

136
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,630
穿好了
There you go.

137
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,760
没事了
It's okay.

138
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,390
没事了
It's okay.

139
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,870
戈登
Gordon.

140
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,550
嘿
Hey.

141
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,410
好消息
Good news.

142
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,780
我们逮到凶手了
We got him, son.

143
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,360
你什么都不用操心
You're in excellent hands.

144
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,130
我们会好好打理公司
We'll be watching the empire.

145
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,340
等你长大了再让你接管
When you grow up, it'll be waiting for you.

146
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,460
我替你准备了晚餐
I thought I might prepare a little supper.

147
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,660
- 好吧 - 阿福？
- Very well. - Alfred?

148
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,660
- 是，布鲁斯少爷 - 都是我的错
- Yes, Master Bruce? - It was my fault, Alfred.

149
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,480
- 我叫他们离开的 - 不是
- I made them leave the theater. - No.

150
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,740
- 要是我不害怕… - 这不是你的错
- If I hadn't gotten scared... - It was nothing that you did.

151
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,230
是凶手一个人的错
It was him, and him alone.

152
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,120
明白吗？
Do you understand?

153
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,390
我想念他们，我好想念他们
I miss them, Alfred. I miss them so much.

154
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,480
我也是，布鲁斯少爷
So do I, Master Bruce.

155
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,120
我也是
So do I.

156
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,300
你还是认为是你害死你父母的吗？
And do you still feel responsible for your parents' death?

157
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,560
我的愤怒比罪恶感更多
My anger outweighs my guilt.

158
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,670
来吧
Come.

159
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,090
你学会了用愤怒代替罪恶感
You have learned to bury your guilt with anger.

160
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,310
我会教你接受它并面对事实
I will teach you to confront it and to face the truth.

161
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:26,860
你可以一个人对付六个人 我要教你一个人对付六百人
You know how to fight six men. We can teach you how to engage 600.

162
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:32,310
你知道怎么把自己藏起来 我可以教你怎么隐形
You know how to disappear.

163
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,570
隐形？
We can teach you to become truly invisible.

164
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,290
小卫
Invisible?

165
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,330
忍者的隐形术全是靠耐心 和矫捷的身手
The ninja understands that invisibility is a matter of patience and agility.

166
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,890
耳听四面、眼观八方
Always mind your surroundings.

167
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,280
忍者会运用火药
Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.

168
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,020
- 做为武器？ - 或是障眼法
- As weapons? - Or distractions.

169
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,530
戏剧效果和障眼法很有效
Theatricality and deception are powerful agents.

170
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,050
你不能让敌人把你当成凡人
You must become more than just a man in the mind of your opponent.

171
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,450
- 他是谁？ - 一个农夫
BRUCE: Who is he? - He was a farmer.

172
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,910
他为了抢邻居的农地杀人
Then he tried to take his neighbor's land and became a murderer.

173
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,340
- 现在变成一名囚犯 - 他会有什么下场？
- Now he is a prisoner. - What'll happen to him?

174
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,950
杀人就要偿命，不能姑息养奸
Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated.

175
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:31,110
社会漠不关心才会让治安败坏
Criminals thrive on the indulgence of society's understanding.

176
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,940
你父母的死不是你的错
Your parents' death was not your fault.

177
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,470
是你父亲的错
It was your father's.

178
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,270
你不能改变他不敢反击的事实
Anger does not change the fact that your father failed to act.

179
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,600
- 对方的手上有枪 - 那能阻止你吗？
- The man had a gun. - Would that stop you?

180
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,600
我接受过武术训练
I've had training.

181
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,630
那不是重点
The training is nothing!

182
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,450
决心才重要
Will is everything!

183
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,070
主动出击的决心
The will to act.

184
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,050
投降吧
Yield.

185
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,760
你并没有打败我
You haven't beaten me.

186
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,720
你为了杀敌失去重心
You have sacrificed sure footing for a killing stroke.

187
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,090
用力磨擦胸口
Rub your chest.

188
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,510
你的手可以帮你取暖
Your arms will take care of themselves.

189
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,750
你比你父亲更坚强
You are stronger than your father.

190
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,050
你不了解我父亲
You didn't know my father.

191
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,550
我了解你内心的愤怒
But I know the rage that drives you.

192
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:09,830
你的愤怒让你暂时忘却伤痛 直到你无法承受
That impossible anger strangling the grief...

193
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,980
对亲人的思念
until the memory of your loved one is just poison in your veins.

194
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,720
有一天你会希望他们不存在
And one day, you catch yourself wishing the person you loved had never existed...

195
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:20,510
好让你的痛苦消失
...so you'd be spared your pain.

196
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,950
我并不是一直都住在山上
I wasn't always here in the mountains.

197
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,560
我也有过一个妻子
Once, I had a wife.

198
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,430
我一生的最爱
My great love.

199
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,740
她惨遭杀害
She was taken from me.

200
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,160
我和你一样学会不能纵容坏人
Like you, I was forced to learn there are those without decency...

201
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,630
对他们绝对不能手下留情
...who must be fought without hesitation, without pity.

202
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,730
愤怒给了你很大的力量
Your anger gives you great power.

203
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,810
但若不学会控制，它会毁了你
But if you let it, it will destroy you...

204
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,480
愤怒差点毁了我一生
...as it almost did me.

205
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,180
- 你是如何平息怒气？ - 报仇
- What stopped it? - Vengeance.

206
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,190
这对我没有用
That's no help to me.

207
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,220
为什么？
Why, Bruce?

208
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:04,080
你为什么不为父母报仇？
Why could you not avenge your parents?

209
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,390
听证会后你要回普林斯顿大学
Will you be heading back to Princeton after the hearing, sir...

210
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,190
还是你愿意多留一、两天？
...or can I persuade you to stay on for a day or two?

211
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,580
我不要回去
I'm not heading back at all.

212
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,770
- 你不喜欢那里？ - 我很喜欢
-You don't like it there? - I like it fine.

213
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:22,010
只是校方不喜欢我
They just don't feel the same way.

214
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,510
- 我安排你睡在主卧室 - 不用
- I've prepared the master bedroom. - No.

215
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,990
我睡我的房间就行
My room will be fine.

216
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,730
恕我直言，韦恩宅邸是你的
With all due respect, sir, Wayne Manor is your house.

217
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,750
不，这是我父亲的
No, Alfred, it's my father's house.

218
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,300
- 你父亲过世了，少爷 - 这地方是他的陵墓
- Your father is dead. - This place is a mausoleum.

219
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,530
我宁愿把它的一砖一瓦拆掉
If I have my way, I'll pull the damn thing down brick by brick.

220
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:42,840
这是韦恩家族世代相传的宅邸
This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered six generations of your family.

221
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,660
你干嘛在乎？ 这又不是你家
Why do you give a damn, Alfred? It's not your family.

222
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,410
我之所以在乎是因为一位好人…
I give a damn because a good man once made me responsible...

223
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,170
把他心爱的独子
...for what was most precious to him...

224
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,580
托付给我
...in the whole world.

225
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,130
道斯小姐要载你到法院
Miss Dawes has offered to drive you to the hearing.

226
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,310
她大概想劝你不要去
She probably hopes to talk you out of going.

227
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,980
我应该把过去也埋在地下吗？
Should I just bury the past out there with my parents, Alfred?

228
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,220
我不能告诉你该如何面对过去
I wouldn't presume to tell you what to do with your past, sir.

229
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:14,470
但是有很多人关心你的未来
Just know that there are those of us who care about what you do with your future.

230
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,260
你还没放弃我，是吗？
Haven't given up on me yet?

231
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,430
永远都不会
Never.

232
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,460
阿福一向都把炼奶放在最上面
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk on the top shelf.

233
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,320
他不知道你已长高、拿得到了吗？
Hasn't he noticed you're tall enough to reach now?

234
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,700
我猜那是老习惯吧
Old habits die hard, I guess.

235
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,630
- 我们小时候一样有办法拿到 - 没错
- Never used to stop us anyway. - No, it didn't.

236
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,670
你母亲好吗？
How's your mom?

237
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,320
她很怀念这地方
She misses this place.

238
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,320
我也一样
So do I.

239
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,950
是啊
Yeah.

240
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:31,190
只可惜现在已经人事全非了
But it's nothing without the people who made it what it was.

241
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,390
- 只有阿福还在这里 - 还有你呀
- Now there's only Alfred. - And you.

242
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,120
- 我不会留下来，瑞秋 - 你只是回来参加听证会
- I'm not staying, Rachel. - You're just back for the hearing.

243
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,960
我知道谁也无法阻止你去
Bruce, I don't suppose there's any way to convince you not to come.

244
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,720
这场听证会总得有人…
Someone at this proceeding...

245
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,500
代表我父母出席
...should stand for my parents.

246
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,810
我们都很爱你的父母
We all loved your parents, Bruce.

247
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:58,260
- 凶手齐利的行为不可原谅 - 但是你的上司却要让他出狱
- What Chill did is unforgivable. - Then why is your boss letting him go?

248
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:02,860
他和卡曼费康尼是牢友
In prison, he shared a cell with Carmine Falcone.

249
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,710
他愿意出庭作证交换提前假释
He learned things, and he will testify in exchange for early parole.

250
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:09,510
瑞秋，他杀死我父母
Rachel, this man killed my parents.

251
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,210
我不能忘记这件事
I cannot let that pass.

252
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:16,300
我希望你能了解我的心情
And I need you to understand that, please.

253
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,190
好吧
Okay.

254
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:23,690
经济大萧条害齐利先生走投无路
The depression hit working people, like Mr. Chill, hardest of all.

255
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:29,090
虽然他的罪行令人发指 但他是走投无路才铤而走险
His crime was appalling, yes, but it was motivated not by greed but by desperation.

256
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:32,140
他已服刑１４年，并将协助我们
Given the 14 years served, as well as his extraordinary level of cooperation...

257
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:35,830
侦办地检署最重大的案件
...with one of this office's most important investigations...

258
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,230
因此我们要求让他假释出狱
...we strongly endorse his petition for early release.

259
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,490
齐利先生？
Mr. Chill?

260
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,700
法官大人
Your Honor...

261
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,800
我每天都为我做的事深感悔恨
...not a day goes by that I don't wish I could take back what I did.

262
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:57,680
我当时的确是走投无路
Sure, I was desperate, like a lot of people back then...

263
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,140
但这不能改变我的所作所为
...but that don't change what I did.

264
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:08,520
今天有一位韦恩家族成员在场
I gather there is a member of the Wayne family here today.

265
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,880
他有话要说吗？
Has he got anything to say?

266
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,490
- 他从侧门出来了 - 他从侧门出来了，各位！
-He's coming out the side! -He's coming out the side, guys!

267
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,650
- 他来了 - 他来了
Bruce Wayne!

268
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,430
乔，乔！
Joe! Hey, Joe!

269
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,080
费康尼老大向你问好
Falcone says hi.

270
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,020
走吧，布鲁斯
Come on, Bruce.

271
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,020
我们不必看到这一幕
We don't need to see this.

272
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,320
我要看
I do.

273
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,570
法官坚持要举行公开听证会
The DA couldn't understand why Judge Faden insisted on making the hearing public.

274
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,080
他一定是被费康尼老大收买了 让齐利公开露面
Falcone paid him off to get Chill out in the open.

275
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,490
也许我应该感谢他们才对
Maybe I should thank them.

276
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:17,280
- 你不是说真的 - 也许我是说真的，瑞秋
- You don't mean that. - What if I do, Rachel?

277
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,360
是该为我父母伸张正义
My parents deserved justice.

278
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:22,470
这不是伸张正义而是报仇雪恨
You're not talking about justice. You're talking about revenge.

279
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,540
- 有时候这两者是一样的 - 不，绝对不一样
- Sometimes, they're the same. - No, they're never the same.

280
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:29,300
伸张正义是为了维持社会和谐 报仇只是为了逞一时之快
Justice is about harmony. Revenge is about you making yourself feel better.

281
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,760
- 所以才会有公正的司法制度 - 司法制度早已名存实亡
- It's why we have an impartial system. - Your system is broken.

282
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,650
你想伸张正义就要忘却伤痛
You care about justice? Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.

283
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,500
这个城市已经沉沦腐败
This city is rotting.

284
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,480
他们说经济大萧条已成历史，才怪
They talk about the depression as if it's history. It's not.

285
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,090
老百姓的日子越来越苦
Things are worse than ever here.

286
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,870
黑帮老大费康尼趁火打劫、无恶不作
Falcone floods our streets with crime and drugs...

287
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:55,000
逼人走上不归路，满街都是齐利之辈
...preying on the desperate, creating new Joe Chills every day.

288
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,680
他也许没有亲手杀死你父母
Falcone may not have killed your parents, Bruce...

289
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,810
却毁了他们代表的一切
...but he's destroying everything that they stood for.

290
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,280
你想感谢他就去吧
You wanna thank him for that? Here you go.

291
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,450
大家都知道他在哪里
We all know where to find him. As long as he keeps the bad people rich...

292
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,070
但是只要他继续为非作歹 就没有人动得了他
...and the good people scared, no one'll touch him.

293
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,700
你父母这种仗义执言的好人 找不到了
Good people like your parents, who'll stand against injustice, they're gone.

294
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,720
没人挺身而出，高谭市就完了
What chance does Gotham have when the good people do nothing?

295
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:28,120
- 我不是你说的好人 - 什么意思？
- I'm not one of your good people, Rachel. - What do you mean?

296
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:34,760
这些年来我一直想杀他 现在没机会了
All these years, I wanted to kill him. Now I can't.

297
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,260
你父亲会以你为耻
Your father would be ashamed of you.

298
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,300
你本人看来比报上的照片高大
You're taller than you look in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.

299
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,580
你没带枪？ 真瞧不起人
No gun? I'm insulted.

300
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:48,700
- 你大可以寄张感谢卡给我就好 - 我不是来感谢你的
- You could've just sent a thank-you note. - I didn't come here to thank you.

301
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:51,520
我要告诉你并不是人人都怕你
I came to show you that not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you.

302
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,270
认识我的人才怕我
Only those who know me, kid.

303
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:56,120
你自己看，这里有两位市议员
Look around you. You'll see two councilmen...

304
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:59,300
一位工会代表，两名警察
...a union official, couple off-duty cops...

305
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,310
和一位法官
...and a judge.

306
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:05,860
我大可以在他们面前毙了你
I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of blowing your head off in front of them.

307
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,700
这种权力是买不到的
Now, that's power you can't buy.

308
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,720
这就是恐惧的力量
That's the power of fear.

309
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,370
我并不怕你
I'm not afraid of you.

310
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,470
你自以为能完全豁出去
Because you think you got nothing to lose.

311
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,260
但是你没有想清楚
But you haven't thought it through.

312
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:19,630
你没想到在地检署工作 青梅竹马的女朋友
You haven't thought about your lady friend in the DA's office.

313
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:22,200
还有对你忠心耿耿的老管家
You haven't thought about your old butler. Bang!

314
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,670
像你这种人
People from your world...

315
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,210
有太多牵挂了
...have so much to lose.

316
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,780
你以为你爹娘被人一枪打死
Now, you think because your mommy and your daddy got shot...

317
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,880
就能了解人性的丑陋吗？
...you know about the ugly side of life, but you don't.

318
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,100
你根本就不知道民间疾苦
You've never tasted desperate.

319
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,850
你是高谭市的天之骄子
You're... You're Bruce Wayne, the prince of Gotham.

320
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,470
你的大名无人不知、无人不晓
You'd have to go 1000 miles to meet someone who didn't know your name.

321
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:51,960
别正气凛然地跑来当一个大英雄
So don't come here with your anger, trying to prove something to yourself.

322
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,140
你完全不了解犯罪世界
This is a world you'll never understand.

323
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,340
你不了解的事
And you always fear...

324
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,970
永远会让你害怕
...what you don't understand.

325
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,190
动手吧
All right.

326
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,730
我倒是很佩服你的胆识
Yeah, you got spirit, kid. I'll give you that.

327
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,830
你比你老子更带种
More than your old man anyway.

328
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:20,380
齐利在牢里跟我提到你父母
In the joint, Chill told me about the night he killed your parents.

329
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,710
他说你老爸向他…
He said your father begged for mercy.

330
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,790
跪地求饶
Begged.

331
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,350
像条狗一样哀号
Like a dog.

332
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,970
你一定是小费给太少了
Should've tipped better.

333
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,820
- 你要什么？ - 你的外套
- For what? - Your jacket.

334
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,970
好吧
Okay.

335
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,620
给我吧，这件大衣不错
Hey, hey, hey. Let me have it. It's a nice coat.

336
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,840
别被人看到你穿这件大衣
Be careful who sees you with that.

337
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,340
- 他们会来找我 - 谁？
- They're gonna come looking for me. - Who?

338
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,490
每个人
Everyone.

339
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,570
这件…
It's...

340
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,710
这件大衣真不错
It's a nice coat.

341
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:36,480
当你和坏人同流合污，会同情他们吗？
When you lived among the criminals, did you start to pity them?

342
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,340
会的，当我第一次为了吃饭偷东西时
The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes.

343
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:46,080
我突然失去了是非善恶的观念
I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong.

344
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:49,310
当我到处闯荡
And when I traveled...

345
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,210
我嚐到犯罪前的恐惧
... I learned the fear before a crime...

346
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,530
以及得手后的兴奋
... and the thrill of success.

347
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,250
但是我从来没变成坏人
But I never became one of them.

348
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,650
他不想说他的名字


349
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,700
我管你叫什么，你只是个犯人
Fool. What do I care what your name is? You're a criminal.

350
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:06,840
我不是犯人
I'm not a criminal

351
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,880
你去和这批货的主人说吧
Tell that to the guy who owned these.

352
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,530
(韦恩企业，中国制造)
You've traveled the world to understand the criminal mind...

353
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:16,140
你为了克服内心恐惧 并洞悉犯罪心理而走遍全世界
...and conquer your fears.

354
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:22,360
但是罪犯的内心并不复杂
But a criminal is not complicated.

355
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,830
你真正害怕的是自己的内心
And what you really fear is inside yourself.

356
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,530
你害怕你自己的力量
You fear your own power.

357
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,910
你也害怕你内心的愤怒…
You fear your anger...

358
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:34,770
会逼你做出伟大或可怕的事
...the drive to do great or terrible things.

359
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:38,350
你必须克服你的内心恐惧
Now you must journey inwards.

360
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:44,150
准备好了
You are ready.

361
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,540
吸气
Breathe.

362
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,000
用力吸气
Breathe.

363
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,830
把你的恐惧吸进去
Breathe in your fears.

364
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,430
面对你的恐惧
Face them.

365
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,810
你要成为恐惧本身，才能克服它
To conquer fear, you must become fear.

366
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:16,410
你必须造成别人的恐惧
You must bask in the fear of other men.

367
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,290
而大家都害怕看不见的东西
And men fear most what they cannot see.

368
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,340
你必须让人想到你就害怕
You have to become a terrible thought.

369
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,040
成为死神化身
A wraith.

370
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,170
让坏人闻风丧胆
You have to become an idea!

371
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,130
感受恐惧如何模糊你的感官
Feel terror cloud your senses.

372
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:10,080
让恐惧的力量扭曲你的身心
Feel its power to distort.

373
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,240
掌控你的一切
To control.

374
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,180
这股恐惧的力量才会属於你
And know that this power can be yours.

375
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,340
拥抱你最深层的恐惧
Embrace your worst fear.

376
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,600
和恐惧的黑暗力量融为一体
Become one with the darkness.

377
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,130
全神贯注
Focus.

378
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,610
全心投入
Concentrate.

379
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,880
随心所欲控制你的全身
Master your senses.

380
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:41,430
你不能露出你的行踪
You cannot leave any sign.

381
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:42,970
我并没有
I haven't.

382
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,280
很好
Impressive.

383
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,480
我们已经消除你的恐惧
We have purged your fear.

384
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:07,240
你可以当这批勇士的首领
You are ready to lead these men.

385
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:11,020
你可以加入影武者联盟
You are ready to become a member of the League of Shadows.

386
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,860
但首先要证明你矢志维护正义
But first, you must demonstrate your commitment to justice.

387
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,860
不
No.

388
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,590
我不是刽子手
I'm no executioner.

389
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:42,930
敌人不会对你手下留情
Your compassion is a weakness your enemies will not share.

390
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:45,510
这才是重点
That's why it's so important.

391
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,480
这就是我们和他们的不同
It separates us from them.

392
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,080
你想打击犯罪，他就是杀人犯
You want to fight criminals. This man is a murderer.

393
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,020
- 他应该接受审判 - 受谁审判？
- This man should be tried. DUCARD: By whom?

394
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,890
让贪污腐败的法官来审判？
Corrupt bureaucrats?

395
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:56,580
坏人根本没把法律放在眼里
Criminals mock society's laws.

396
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,050
你比任何人都清楚这一点
You know this better than most.

397
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:02,530
你不能率领他们
You cannot lead these men...

398
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,760
除非你能不择手段打击犯罪
...unless you are prepared to do what is necessary to defeat evil.

399
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,740
我要率领他们到哪里？
And where would I be leading these men?

400
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,480
高谭市
Gotham.

401
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,750
你是高谭市的天之骄子
As Gotham's favored son...

402
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:18,360
你有能力瓦解高谭市的恶势力
...you will be ideally placed to strike at the heart of criminality.

403
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:22,470
- 我该怎么做？ - 高谭市的气数已尽
- How? - Gotham's time has come.

404
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,950
就跟君士坦丁堡和古罗马一样
Like Constantinople or Rome before it...

405
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:30,350
高谭市已经沦为万恶的城市
...the city has become a breeding ground for suffering and injustice.

406
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:34,100
它无可救药，必须将它毁灭
It is beyond saving and must be allowed to die.

407
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:39,540
这是影武者联盟最重要的任务
This is the most important function of the League of Shadows.

408
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,820
也是我们数百年来的使命
It is one we've performed for centuries.

409
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,830
高谭市…
Gotham...

410
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,960
一定要被摧毁
...must be destroyed.

411
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,720
你不会信这种鬼话吧？
You can't believe in this.

412
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:57,580
忍者大师将我们从 内心最黑暗的角落拯救出来
Ra's al Ghul rescued us from the darkest corners of our own hearts.

413
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:02,170
他要求我们以勇气 行当行之事回报他
What he asks in return is the courage to do what is necessary.

414
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:05,690
我会回高谭市对付这类坏人
I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men like this...

415
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,380
但是我不会当刽子手
...but I will not become an executioner.

416
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,080
布鲁斯，别这样
Bruce, please.

417
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:13,140
你要想清楚，你已不能回头
For your own sake, there is no turning back.

418
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:48,020
- 你是在干什么？ - 行我当行之事
- What are you doing? - What's necessary, my friend.

419
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,560
我会跟他说你救他一命
I will tell him you saved his life.

420
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:28,820
韦恩少爷，你消失好一阵子
Master Wayne, you've been gone a long time.

421
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:31,250
- 是啊 - 你这身打扮很时髦
- Yes, I have. - You look very fashionable.

422
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,220
只是有点脏
Apart from the mud.

423
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:37,200
你这次会待很久吗？
Are you coming back to Gotham for long, sir?

424
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,540
需要待多久就待多久
As long as it takes.

425
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,220
我要让高谭市市民知道
I want to show the people...

426
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:43,910
这城市不属於贪官与罪犯
...their city doesn't belong to the criminals and the corrupt.

427
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:47,270
经济大萧条期间你爸为了消弭贫穷
In the depression, your father nearly bankrupted Wayne Enterprises...

428
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,580
几乎倾家荡产
...combating poverty.

429
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:53,420
他相信他能让有钱人共襄盛举 拯救高谭市
He believed his example could inspire the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.

430
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,200
他成功了吗？
Did it?

431
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,810
算是吧
In a way.

432
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:01,100
他惨遭谋杀，为有钱有势的人敲响警钟
Their murder shocked the wealthy and the powerful into action.

433
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:06,170
人们的漠不关心 唯有戏剧性大逆转才能唤醒
People need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy.

434
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,950
身为布鲁斯韦恩做不了什么
I can't do that as Bruce Wayne.

435
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,640
我只是个血肉之躯
As a man...

436
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,260
很容易被忽视、摧毁
...I'm flesh and blood, I can be ignored, destroyed.

437
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,340
但是成为正义化身
But as a symbol...

438
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:18,470
我就永远不会被击败
As a symbol, I can be incorruptible.

439
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:21,270
- 永远正气长存 - 什么化身？
- I can be everlasting. - What symbol?

440
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:24,540
一种原始的…
Something elemental...

441
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,300
可怕的化身
...something terrifying.

442
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,590
你单枪匹马对抗犯罪集团
I assume that as you take on the underworld...

443
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:33,980
我以为这化身是会 保护你关心的人不被报复
...this symbol is a persona to protect those you care about from reprisals?

444
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,400
你说的是瑞秋吗？
You're thinking about Rachel?

445
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,980
其实我说的是我自己
Actually, sir, I was thinking of myself.

446
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,720
有人知道我回来吗？
Have you told anyone I'm coming back?

447
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:46,220
我不敢让人知道你死而复生
I couldn't figure the legal ramifications of bringing you back from the dead.

448
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,200
- 死而复生？ - 你失踪了七年
- Dead? - You've been gone seven years.

449
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:49,600
你对外宣布我死了？
You had me declared dead?

450
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,750
其实是厄尔先生，他要让公司上市
Actually, it was Mr. Earle. He's taking the company public.

451
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:55,150
他也要把你的股票卖掉
He wanted to liquidate your majority shareholding.

452
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:57,660
那些股票值很多钱
Those shares are worth quite a bit of money.

453
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:00,580
幸好我把全部财产都留给你
Well, it's a good thing I left everything to you, then.

454
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,800
是的，少爷
Quite so, sir.

455
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,690
我的劳斯莱斯可以借你开 回来时别忘了加满油
And you can borrow the Rolls, if you like. Just bring it back with a full tank.

456
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:21,670
我认为萨兹先生会试图自杀并危害他人
In my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much a danger to himself as to others...

457
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:26,600
因此监狱并不适合他
...and prison is probably not the best environment for his rehabilitation.

458
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,420
- 克莱恩医师 - 道斯小姐
- Dr. Crane. - Miss Dawes.

459
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:34,890
你真的认为黑道杀手不该坐牢？
You think a man who butchers people for the mob doesn't belong in jail?

460
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,700
我若不这么认为，就不会替他辩护
I would hardly have testified to that otherwise, would I?

461
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,980
费康尼老大有三个杀手
This is the third of Falcone's thugs you've had declared insane...

462
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:42,490
被你送进精神疗养院
...and moved into your asylum.

463
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:47,490
混黑道一定很容易被逼疯
The work offered by organized crime must have an attraction to the insane.

464
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:50,910
或是被收买
Or the corrupt.

465
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,730
芬奇先生
Mr. Finch.

466
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,880
你最好劝劝道斯小姐
You should check with Miss Dawes here...

467
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:01,530
不要无凭无据对我提出指控
...just what implications your office has authorized her to make. If any.

468
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,750
- 瑞秋，你这是在做什么？ - 你又是在做什么，卡尔？
- What are you doing? - What are you doing, Carl?

469
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,240
我是在保护你
FINCH: Looking out for you.

470
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,710
费康尼收买了一半的政府官员
Falcone has half the city bought and paid for.

471
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,900
- 放弃吧 - 你怎么能这么说？
- Drop it. - How can you say that?

472
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:20,850
我痛恨费康尼，但我更关心你
Because as much as I care about getting Falcone, I care more about you.

473
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,210
我知道你对我好
That's sweet.

474
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:30,030
但我不能接受
We've been through all that.

475
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,520
又有一只蝙蝠飞进来
ALFRED: Blessed bat again, sir.

476
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:00,430
牠们的巢穴一定在地底
They nest somewhere in the grounds.

477
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,010
我不帮你了，有人对我起疑心
No more favors. Someone is sniffing around.

478
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:04,160
我帮你，你帮我
Hey, I scratch your back, you scratch mine, doc.

479
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,620
我替你们把货运进来
I'm bringing in the shipments.

480
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:07,550
我们有付你钱
We are paying you for that.

481
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:10,270
付钱并不算是帮我的忙
Maybe money isn't as interesting to me as favors.

482
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:17,640
我知道你并不怕我，费康尼先生
I am more than aware that you are not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.

483
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:20,840
但是等我的老板来了以后…
But you know who I'm working for, and when he gets here...

484
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,900
他要来高谭市？
He... He's coming to Gotham?

485
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,480
是的
Yes, he is.

486
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:27,160
他来了以后会想听到…
And when he gets here, he's not going to wanna hear...

487
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:32,530
你为了几个小混混危害我们的行动
...that you've endangered our operation just to get your thugs out of jail time.

488
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:36,800
- 谁在找你麻烦？ - 地检署的一个女孩
- Who's bothering you? - There's a girl at the DA's office.

489
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:39,000
- 我们用钱收买她 - 她不要钱
- We'll buy her off. - Not this one.

490
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,040
原来是理想主义者
Idealist, huh?

491
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:43,930
我也有办法对付这种人
Well, there's an answer to that too.

492
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:47,330
- 我并不想知道 - 你非知道不可
- I don't want to know. - Yes, you do.

493
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:51,280
(韦恩大楼)


494
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:54,960
其它部门的业绩有稳健的成长
No, we are showing very healthy growth in these sectors.

495
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:58,310
汤玛斯韦恩绝对不会同意…
I don't think Thomas Wayne would have viewed heavy-arms manufacture...

496
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:00,560
让公司变成军火制造商
...as a suitable cornerstone for our business.

497
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,840
那是二十年前的事，佛德瑞
Well, that's 20 years ago, Fredericks.

498
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:09,280
汤玛斯韦恩都死了二十年
I think after 20 years we can allow ourselves...

499
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,310
我们不必再管他怎么想
...to stop thinking about what Thomas Wayne would have done.

500
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,300
早安，厄尔先生办公室
Good morning, Mr. Earle's office.

501
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:17,830
是的，他确定明天会出席晚宴
Yes, he's confirmed for the dinner tomorrow evening.

502
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:21,300
早安，我来见厄尔先生
Good morning. I'm here to see Mr. Earle.

503
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:22,920
请问贵姓大名？
Name?

504
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,030
布鲁斯韦恩
Bruce Wayne.

505
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:30,480
汤玛斯也许不会让公司上市
Thomas would probably not have taken the company public.

506
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:34,810
但我们为了公司一定要这么做
But that is what we, as responsible managers, are going to do.

507
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:36,940
洁西卡？
Jessica?

508
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:40,580
洁西卡？ 你在哪里？
Jessica? Where are you?

509
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:45,100
- 盯着小白球看… - 你为什么不接电话？
-Eye on the ball, and... - Why is no one answering the phone?

510
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:48,880
放心，对方一定会再打来
It's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle. I'm sure they'll call back.

511
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:51,690
布鲁斯？ 你不是死了吗？
Bruce? You're supposed to be dead.

512
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,770
抱歉让你失望了
I'm sorry to disappoint.

513
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:56,710
- 你要看看这份文件 - 你见到他了吗？
- I need you to take a look at this. - Have you seen him yet?

514
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,490
- 谁？ - 韦恩
- Who? - Wayne.

515
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,910
新闻整天都在播，他回来了
It's been all over the news. He's back.

516
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:07,790
请你了解这件事势在必行
I'm sure you realize I can't stop the big machine.

517
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,120
时势如此
Too many wheels turning.

518
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:11,350
- 公司一定要上市 - 我了解
- We're going public. - I understand.

519
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,660
我也会分到不少钱
And I'll be handsomely rewarded for my shares.

520
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:17,380
我并不想干涉公司行政
I'm not looking to interfere.

521
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,930
- 我只想要一份工作 - 哦？
- I am looking for a job. - Oh?

522
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:23,210
我想多了解我的家族企业
I just want to get to know the company that my family built.

523
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:25,220
你想先进哪个部门？
Any ideas where you would start?

524
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:28,120
我对应用科技部门有兴趣
Applied Sciences caught my eye.

525
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:30,190
福克斯的部门
Fox's department.

526
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:32,370
我会通知他
I'll let him know you're coming.

527
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,080
你跟你爸长得很像
You look like him. Your dad.

528
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:39,540
你是韦恩家族唯一的遗孤
You're the only one left of the Wayne family.

529
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:43,730
这是你的家，欢迎回家
This is where you belong. Welcome home.

530
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:48,560
环保科技、军火、消费产品
Environmental procedures, defense projects, consumer products.

531
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:51,720
全都是实验原型 并没有进入量产阶段
All prototypes. None in production.

532
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,550
- 完全没有 - 完全没有？
- On any level whatsoever. - None?

533
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:57,360
他们是怎么跟你说这部门的？
What did they tell you this place was?

534
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:59,560
他们什么都没说
They didn't tell me anything.

535
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,520
厄尔倒是跟我说得很明白
Earle told me exactly what it was when he sent me down here.

536
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:07,390
我被打入冷宫
Dead end.

537
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:10,970
好让我不在董事会上找麻烦
Place to keep me from causing the board any more trouble.

538
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,310
来吧
Come on.

539
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:16,000
- 你曾经是公司董事？ - 当你父亲还在的时候
- You were on the board? - When your father ran things.

540
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:18,040
- 你认识我父亲？ - 是啊
- You knew my father? - Oh, yeah.

541
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:19,830
我协助他建造高架铁路系统
Helped him build his train.

542
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:22,060
到了
Here we are.

00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:27,370
多功能强化防护带

544
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:29,720
汽动式磁力钩爪枪
Gas-powered, magnetic grapple gun.

545
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:32,200
承受重量高达１５８公斤
The 350-pound test monofilament.

546
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:37,740
你爸设计的铁路系统很棒
Wonderful project, your dad's train.

547
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:42,920
每一条路线都直达韦恩大楼 水电管线也直接连到这里
Routed it right into Wayne Tower, along with the water and power utilities.

548
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,290
让韦恩大楼成为高谭市的命脉
Kind of made Wayne Tower the unofficial center of Gotham City.

549
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,100
厄尔却让它荒废，请看
Of course, Earle let it go to rot. Here we are.

550
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:53,080
先锋部队的装甲衣
Nomex survival suit for advanced infantry.

551
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,040
克维拉纤维，强化护肘护膝
Kevlar biweave, reinforced joints.

552
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,730
- 防裂材质？ - 连刀都刺不穿
- Tear-resistant? - This sucker will stop a knife.

553
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,120
- 防弹吗？ - 刀枪不入
- Bulletproof? - Anything but a straight shot.

554
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,700
为什么不量产？
- Why didn't they put it into production? - Bean counters didn't think...

555
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:06,760
军方认为士兵的命不值３０万元
...a soldier's life was worth 300 grand.

556
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:11,290
你为什么对这些感兴趣？
So, what's your interest in it, Mr. Wayne?

557
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:13,400
我想借来用
I want to borrow it.

558
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:15,350
我要做洞穴探险
For spelunking.

559
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:17,500
洞穴探险？
Spelunking?

560
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:19,420
对，到山洞探险
Yeah, you know, cave diving?

561
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:23,390
有人会在山洞向你开枪吗？
You expecting to run into much gunfire in these caves?

562
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:29,030
我不希望让厄尔知道…
Look, I'd rather Mr. Earle didn't know about me borrowing...

563
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:30,340
韦恩先生
Mr. Wayne...

564
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:32,510
对我来说
...the way I see it...

565
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,430
这一切都是你的
...all this stuff is yours anyway.

566
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,900
好了，试试看
Okay. Give it a try.

567
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,220
真是个好地方
Charming.

568
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,880
至少你有很多同伴
At least you'll have company.

569
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:56,840
这一定是东南厢房的地基
This must be the lowest foundation of the southeast wing.

570
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:13,530
你曾祖父在内战时透过地下管道
Your great-great-grandfather was involved in the Underground Railroad...

571
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:16,630
秘密将黑奴运送来北方
...secretly transporting freed slaves to the North...

572
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:20,520
我怀疑就是偷藏在这些洞穴
...and I suspect these caverns came in handy.

573
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:35,340
阿福，过来看看
Alfred! Come up here!

574
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:38,510
我在这里就看得见，多谢了
I can see everything all right from down here, sir, thank you.

575
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,170
头罩的主要零件来自新加坡
We order the main part of this cowl from Singapore.

576
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,790
透过傀儡公司进口
Via a dummy corporation.

577
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:04,850
是的
Indeed. And then, quite separately...

578
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:10,090
这零件则是向中国公司订购
...we place an order to a Chinese company for these.

579
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:13,510
- 然后我们自己组装 - 没错
- Put it together ourselves. - Precisely.

580
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:17,750
大量订购才不会让人起疑
They'll have to be large orders, to avoid suspicion.

581
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:20,420
- 有多少？ - 一万个
- How large? - Say 10,000.

582
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:25,880
- 至少会有很多备用品 - 是啊
- Well, at least we'll have spares. - Yes.

583
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,990
你不分一杯羹吗？
Don't suppose you want a taste.

584
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,370
我在想也许有一天你会学聪明
I just keep offering, thinking maybe someday you'll get wise.

585
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:50,660
你这么做一点都不聪明
There's nothing wise in what you do, Flass.

586
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:54,260
老詹，你不收贿让大家很紧张
Well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste, makes us guys nervous.

587
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,230
我不会告密
I'm no rat.

588
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:02,740
大家都被收买，我能向谁告状？
In a town this bent, who's there to rat to anyway?

589
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,500
别转身
Don't turn around.

590
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,210
你是硕果仅存的好警察
You're a good cop. One of the few.

591
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:39,930
你要干什么？
What do you want?

592
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:43,350
费康尼每星期都进一批毒品
Carmine Falcone brings in shipments of drugs every week.

593
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:45,260
为什么没人阻止他？
Nobody takes him down. Why?

594
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:48,810
他收买了警察和法官
He's paid up with the right people.

595
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:51,910
该怎么做才能制止他？
What will it take to bring him down?

596
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:55,040
向斐登法官施压
Leverage on Judge Faden...

597
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:58,140
找一个有胆识的检察官
...and a DA brave enough to prosecute.

598
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,130
瑞秋道斯
Rachel Dawes.

599
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,810
你是谁？
Who are you?

600
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:03,870
注意我的信号
Watch for my sign.

601
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,590
你只有一个人？
You're just one man?

602
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:10,440
现在我们有两个人
Now we're two.

603
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,140
我们？
We?

604
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,530
站住！
Freeze!

605
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:50,660
那是什么人？
What the hell was that?

606
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:54,770
只是一个疯子
Just some nut.

607
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:01,040
今天你又要去洞穴探险吗？
Well, what is it today? More spelunking?

608
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:03,660
不，今天我要定点跳伞
No. Today it's BASE-jumping.

609
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,860
定点跳伞？
BASE-jumping.

610
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:09,030
- 像是高空跳伞吗？ - 差不多
- That like parachuting? - Kind of.

611
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:13,050
你有轻质布料吗？
Do you have any lightweight fabrics?

612
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:15,880
我正好有你要的布料
You know, I think I have just the thing.

613
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:19,640
这叫记忆布料，看到吗？
It's called memory cloth. Notice anything?

614
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,860
和一般布料一样轻柔
Regularly flexible...

615
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:27,400
但是一旦通上电流
...but put a current through it...

616
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:32,600
- 分子重新组合后就会变硬 - 你可以做成什么形状？？
...molecules realign, it becomes rigid. - What kind of shapes can you make?

617
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:35,880
只要有骨架，什么形状都行
Can be tailored to fit any structure based on a rigid skeleton.

618
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,200
军方又嫌太贵吗？
Too expensive for the Army?

619
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:42,230
他们没想到亿万富翁会有兴趣 去洞穴探险或定点跳伞
I don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, BASE-jumping crowd.

620
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:44,100
- 福克斯先生 - 是的
- Look, Mr. Fox. - Yes, sir?

621
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,120
如果你觉得不妥…
If you're uncomfortable...

622
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:49,560
只要你不跟我实话实说
Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing...

623
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,650
我被问到就不必说谎
...when I'm asked, I don't have to lie.

624
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:56,040
不过别以为我是傻子
But don't think of me as an idiot.

625
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,490
好吧
Fair enough.

626
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:03,220
那是什么？
What's that?

627
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:07,230
那辆弹力车？
The Tumbler?

628
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:09,700
你不会有兴趣的
Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.

629
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:17,640
这是造桥用的越野车
She was built as a bridging vehicle.

630
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:24,150
作战时可以拉着缆绳跳过河流
During combat, two of these would jump over a river, towing cables.

631
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:30,280
只要让推进器全速前进
Over here on the throttle, flip that open and throttle up.

632
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,970
它就能越过任何障碍 不要乱来！
This will boost you into a rampless jump... Not now!

633
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:37,920
小子，别乱来
Not... Not now, sir.

634
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,620
关闭再燃装置
Afterburner disengaged.

635
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:46,070
我们一直没办法造桥
We never could get the damn bridge to work...

636
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:47,920
不过这辆车性能超强
...but this baby works just fine.

637
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:58,670
你觉得怎样？
So, what do you think?

638
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:01,970
有黑色车款吗？
Does it come in black?

639
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:04,990
我要你星期四到码头
I need you at the docks Thursday.

640
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:07,110
- 有麻烦吗？ - 最后一批货…
- Problems? - I don't want any trouble...

641
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,380
- 最后一批货不能出错 - 好吧
...with the last shipment. - Sure.

642
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:14,720
听说有一位检察官在找你麻烦
Word on the street is you got a beef with somebody in the DA's office.

643
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:17,240
- 是吗？ - 听说你肯付…
- Is that right? - And that there's a fat prize...

644
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:20,120
一大笔钱把她除掉
...waiting for anybody willing to do anything about it.

645
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:22,230
你想说什么，佛莱斯警官？
So, what's your point, Mr. Flass?

646
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:23,890
你看过那女孩吗？
Have you seen the girl?

647
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:27,160
她是个美女助理检察官
It's a cute little assistant DA.

648
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:31,030
拿她开刀不太好吧？
Don't you think that's a little too much heat to bring down, maybe?

649
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:34,490
- 你会激起众怒 - 别太高估高谭市的治安
- Even for this town. - Never underestimate Gotham City.

650
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:37,480
每天都有人下班被抢
People get mugged coming home from work every day of the week.

651
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,260
有时候就是会莫名其妙走霉运
Sometimes... Sometimes things just go bad.

652
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:45,900
这批货的石墨含量太高
It's a problem with the graphite, sir.

653
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:48,840
下一批货一定没问题
The next 10,000 will be up to specifications.

654
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,570
- 至少厂商给我们打了折 - 是啊
- At least they gave us a discount. - Quite.

655
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:57,510
我建议你最好暂时不要撞到头
In the meantime, sir, may I suggest you try to avoid landing on your head?

656
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:36,380
你为什么选择蝙蝠？
Why bats, Master Wayne?

657
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:37,860
蝙蝠让我感到恐惧
Bats frighten me.

658
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,470
我也要让敌人一样畏惧我
It's time my enemies shared my dread.

659
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:10,080
这是干嘛？
What is this?

660
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:15,160
继续干活吧
Continue.

661
01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:22,700
看起来没问题
Looks fine out there.

662
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:25,010
玩具熊直接交给毒贩吗？
The bears go straight to the dealers.

663
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:27,880
对，玩具兔要运到奈何岛
Yeah, and the rabbits go to the man in the Narrows.

664
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:31,090
- 这两种毒品有什么不同？ - 你最好不要知道
- What's the difference? - Ignorance is bliss, my friend.

665
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:34,440
你惹不起那些大魔头
Don't burden yourself with the secrets of scary people.

666
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:53,250
小史？
Hey. Steiss.

667
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,960
小史？
Steiss?

668
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,500
干嘛？
What?

669
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:31,740
搞什么？
What the...?

670
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:42,600
我最好去看看
I better check it.

671
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:57,140
大事不妙，你最好闪人
There's a problem out here. You better bail.

672
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:28,050
你在哪里？
Where are you?!

673
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:29,260
这里
Here.

674
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:53,710
快开车，哦，要命！
Take a ride. Oh, shit.

675
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,930
你是什么东西？
What the hell are you?

676
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:18,090
我是蝙蝠侠
I'm Batman.

677
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:28,440
好帅的大衣
Nice coat.

678
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:31,680
谢了
Thanks.

679
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:13,940
别过来
Hold it.

680
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:18,600
给我滚远一点
That's right, you better run.

681
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:29,380
费康尼派他们来杀你
Falcone sent them to kill you.

682
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,100
- 为什么？ - 你把他惹毛了
- Why? - You rattled his cage.

683
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:38,400
- 这是什么？ - 你的筹码
- What's this? - Leverage.

684
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:40,170
- 用来做什么？ - 把坏人绳之以法
- For what? - To get things moving.

685
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,480
你是谁？
Who are you?

686
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:44,090
像你一样
Someone like you.

687
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:46,320
想要伸张正义的人
Someone who'll rattle the cages.

688
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:54,990
小姐，你没事吧？
Ma'am? Everything okay?

689
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:01,750
- 他们是费康尼的手下？ - 逮到他们也没用
Falcone's men? - Does it matter?

690
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:04,180
费康尼一样有办法脱身
We'll never tie him to it anyway.

691
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,510
这次他脱不了身
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

692
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:21,380
这是怎么回事？
What the hell is that?

693
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:32,230
把他放下来
Cut him down.

694
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:54,640
(蝙蝠侠逮到黑帮老大)


695
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,040
这不可原谅
Unacceptable.

696
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,110
我不管他是帮派死对头、守护天使
Now, I don't care if it's rival gangs, Guardian Angels...

697
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,210
或是什么救世主
...or the goddamn Salvation Army...

698
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,830
把他抓起来，别让他出风头
...get them off the street and off the front page.

699
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:06,570
听说他是一个人，或是一个怪物
They say it was just one guy. Or a creature.

700
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:09,440
他只是奇装异服的怪胎
It was some asshole in a costume.

701
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,600
- 干嘛？ - 他抓到…
- Yeah? - This guy did deliver us...

702
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,580
势力最大的黑帮老大
...one of the city's biggest crime lords.

703
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:18,280
没人能在我的辖区动私刑
No one takes the law into their own hands in my city.

704
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:19,550
明白吗？
Understand?

705
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:22,380
- 他这次难逃法律制裁 - 斐登法官会罩他
No way to bury it now. FINCH: There's still Judge Faden.

706
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:25,780
- 我能对付斐登法官 - 大家都说是一只蝙蝠干的？
- I've got Faden covered. - What about this bat they babble about?

707
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:28,930
就算他们作证说是大蝙蝠干的
Even if these guys will swear to being thrashed by a giant bat...

708
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:31,230
费康尼还是被逮个正着
...we've got Falcone at the scene.

709
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:34,650
蝙蝠侠把他犯案的证据都给我
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests. This bat character gave us everything.

710
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:36,540
那就起诉他吧
Okay. Let's do it.

711
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,100
- 蝙蝠是夜行动物 - 也许是吧
- Bats are nocturnal. ALFRED: Bats may be.

712
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:45,770
不过你也不能睡到下午三点
But even for billionaire playboys, 3:00 is pushing it.

713
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:49,650
这是过双重生活的代价
The price for leading a double life, I fear.

714
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:53,400
你制造的戏剧效果很唬人
Your theatrics made an impression.

715
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:57,820
戏剧效果和障眼法…
Theatricality and deception...

716
01:06:57,870 --> 01:07:01,240
能打击犯罪 这是好的开始
...are powerful weapons, Alfred. This is a good start.

717
01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:04,190
如果你以后会一直受伤
If those are to be the first of many injuries to come...

718
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:07,190
就要找很好的藉口
...it would be wise to find a suitable excuse.

719
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:08,800
比如说打马球
Polo, for instance.

720
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:10,600
我又不会打马球
I'm not learning polo, Alfred.

721
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:14,630
无缘无故受伤，缺乏社交生活
Strange injuries, a nonexistent social life.

722
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:16,180
大家一定会怀疑
These things beg the question...

723
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:20,680
布鲁斯韦恩大少爷都在搞什么鬼
...as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne do with his time and his money.

724
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,340
像我这种人都做什么？
What does someone like me do?

725
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:27,630
开名贵跑车，泡漂亮女星
Drive sports cars, date movie stars.

726
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,750
买一些别人买不起的东西
Buy things that are not for sale.

727
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:33,570
韦恩少爷，当你假装找乐子
Who knows, Master Wayne, you start pretending to have fun...

728
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:36,100
也许真的会找到快乐
...you might even have a little by accident.

729
01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:40,260
老板
Sir.

730
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,790
- 出了状况 - 什么事？
- We have a situation. - All right.

731
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:47,060
海巡队昨晚发现我们的货轮
The Coast Guard picked up one of our cargo ships last night...

732
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:52,440
船身受损，船员失踪 大概全都丧命
...heavily damaged, all crew missing, probably dead.

733
01:07:54,310 --> 01:07:58,840
货轮载了一具微波发射器
The ship was carrying a prototype weapon. It's a microwave emitter.

734
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,940
是用来进行沙漠战争的
It's designed for desert warfare, but it...

735
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,100
但是看起来有人…
It looks like somebody...

736
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:11,000
利用它杀人
...turned it on.

737
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:19,750
它能发射微波蒸发敌人的供水
It uses focused microwaves to vaporize the enemy's water supply.

738
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:30,550
货轮严重受损
The damage to the ship was catastrophic.

739
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,720
那具武器也…
The weapon itself is...

740
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,450
不见了？
Missing?

741
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,550
对
Yeah.

742
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,820
韦恩先生
Mr. Wayne.

743
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:46,970
这辆车好酷
Nice car.

744
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,530
我的另一辆车更酷
You should see my other one.

745
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,500
他逮到警方抓不到的大坏蛋
He's done something the police never have.

746
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:02,980
他不能动用私刑
You can't take the law into your own hands.

747
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:05,720
至少他在打击犯罪
Well, at least he's getting something done.

748
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:08,220
布鲁斯，你来评评理
Bruce, help me out here. - Huh?

749
01:09:08,290 --> 01:09:12,840
一个扮成蝙蝠的人一定有毛病
Well, a guy who dresses up like a bat clearly has issues.

750
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:16,020
可是他把费康尼关起来
But he's put Falcone behind bars.

751
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:18,560
警方并不领情，那代表什么？
Now the cops want him. What does that tell you?

752
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:19,910
那代表他们嫉妒他
They're jealous.

753
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:22,770
水池是装饰用的
Sir, the pool is for decoration...

754
01:09:22,830 --> 01:09:26,340
不能下去游泳
...and your friends do not have swimwear.

755
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,050
她们是欧洲豪放女
Well, they're European.

756
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:34,310
我要请你们离开
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

757
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:36,870
你给我再多小费也没用
It is not a question of money.

758
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:38,640
你看着…
Well, you see...

759
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:41,010
我要买下这家饭店
...I'm buying this hotel...

760
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:47,340
新规定，从今以后水池可以游泳
...and setting some new rules about the pool area.

761
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:50,820
我觉得应该颁奖给蝙蝠侠
I think the Batman deserves a medal.

762
01:09:50,890 --> 01:09:53,100
把他送进疯人院才对
And a straitjacket to pin it on.

763
01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:01,150
谢谢
Thank you.

764
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:04,250
布鲁斯？
Bruce?

765
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,640
瑞秋？
Rachel?

766
01:10:09,730 --> 01:10:11,190
我听说你回来了
I'd heard you were back.

767
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,730
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

768
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:20,040
只是泡泡水，见到你真好
Just swimming here. Wow, it is good to see you.

769
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:21,630
你离开了好久
You were gone a long time.

770
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:25,200
- 是啊，你好吗？ - 老样子
- I know. How are things? - The same.

771
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:28,710
工作越来越辛苦
Job's getting worse.

772
01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:31,660
光靠自己是不能改变世界的
Can't change the world on your own.

773
01:10:31,710 --> 01:10:33,860
我没有别的选择
What choice do I have...

774
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:36,290
你只会忙着和辣妹泡水
...when you're too busy swimming?

775
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,660
瑞秋，这…
Rachel, all of...

776
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:41,580
这一切
All this...

777
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:47,150
不是真正的我
It's... It's not me. It's...

778
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:50,160
其实我的内心…
Inside, I am...

779
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:53,270
并没有这么肤浅
I am more.

780
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:55,490
快来嘛，布鲁斯
Come on, Bruce. Come on.

781
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:59,560
咱们再去多买几家饭店
Bruce, we have some more hotels for you to buy.

782
01:11:00,430 --> 01:11:01,960
布鲁斯
Bruce...

783
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:06,710
你内心深处仍是那个正直的小孩
...deep down you may still be that same great kid you used to be.

784
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:11,670
但是在你外表底下是谁并不重要
But it's not who you are underneath...

785
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:13,840
你的所作所为才重要
...it's what you do that defines you.

786
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:27,980
克莱恩医师，谢谢你来访
Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.

787
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,070
不客气，他想割腕自杀？
Not at all. He cut his wrists?

788
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:34,940
他想装疯脱罪，不过万一出事…
Probably looking for the insanity plea. But if anything should happen...

789
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,010
还是保险一点比较好
Of course, better safe than sorry.

790
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:45,040
我受不了了，我快发疯了
Yeah, Dr. Crane, I can't take it anymore. It's all too much.

791
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:47,630
我一定要出去
The walls are closing in. Blah, blah, blah.

792
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:50,690
再吃几天牢饭我真的会发疯
A couple of days of this food, it'll be true.

793
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,330
- 你要什么？ - 我要知道…
- What do you want? - I wanna know...

794
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:56,010
你打算怎么让我闭嘴
...how you're gonna convince me to keep my mouth shut.

795
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:58,360
你什么都不知道
About what? You don't know anything.

796
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:02,940
我知道你怕警方仔细查那批毒品
I know you don't want the cops to take a closer look at the drugs they seized.

797
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:07,270
也知道你替囚犯进行人体实验
And I know about your experiments with the inmates of your nut house.

798
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:11,090
我一定会先查出合夥人的底细
See, I don't go into business with a guy without finding out his dirty secrets.

799
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:14,530
你找来的打手
And those goons you used.

800
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,490
都是我的人
I own the muscle in this town.

801
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:20,120
我一直替你把货运进来
Now, I've been bringing your stuff in for months...

802
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:24,890
你的老板一定想大干一票 要算我一份
...so whatever he's planning, it's big, and I want in.

803
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:29,280
我知道他会怎么说
Well, I already know what he'll say.

804
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:30,980
我们应该杀了你灭口
That we should kill you.

805
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:36,260
他在我的地盘动不了我
Even he can't get me in here. Not in my town.

806
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:43,650
你想看我的面具吗？
Would you like to see my mask?

807
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,660
我用它来做实验
I use it in my experiments.

808
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:53,750
你这大恶人不会觉得可怕
Now, I'm probably not very frightening to a guy like you.

809
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:56,890
不过疯子就会被吓死
But these crazies, they can't stand it.

810
01:12:57,710 --> 01:12:59,760
原来疯人院是你这疯子开的
So when did the nut take over the nut house?

811
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:03,420
他们都跟你一样
They scream and they cry...

812
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:05,970
大哭大叫
...much as you're doing now.

813
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:11,580
他这次并不是装疯
Well, he's not faking. Not that one.

814
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:14,280
我会和法官谈谈 把他送到我的精神病院
I'll talk to the judge and see if I can get him moved...

815
01:13:14,350 --> 01:13:17,900
他待在这儿没有救
...to the secure wing at Arkham. I can't treat him here.

816
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:41,320
一场大风暴即将来临
Storm's coming.

817
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:48,990
你逮到费康尼让黑道很紧张
The scum is getting jumpy because you stood up to Falcone.

818
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:52,720
你的搭档和费康尼挂勾
It's a start. Your partner was at the docks with Falcone.

819
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:55,550
他有时候也帮黑道办事
Well, he moonlights as a low-level enforcer.

820
01:13:55,810 --> 01:13:59,770
毒品分成两半，一半交给毒贩
They were splitting the shipment in two. Only half went to the dealers.

821
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:01,800
那另一半呢？
Why? What about the other half?

822
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:04,690
- 佛莱斯知道 - 他不会说
- Flass knows. - He won't talk.

823
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:06,840
他一定会跟我说
He'll talk to me.

824
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:10,110
罗柏局长成立专案小组追捕你
Commissioner Loeb set up a massive task force to catch you.

825
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:13,090
- 他认为你是危险人物 - 你认为呢？
- He thinks you're dangerous. - What do you think?

826
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:17,300
我认为你想尽力帮忙
I think you're trying to help.

827
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,590
不过有时候我会看错人
But I've been wrong before.

828
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:32,070
快点，别慢吞吞
Come on, I ain't got all night.

829
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:37,250
拜托，我有小孩要养
Flass, I have kids to feed.

830
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:39,890
他们不爱吃三明治吗？
What, they don't like falafel?

831
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:56,990
另一批毒品在哪里？
Where were the other drugs going?

832
01:14:58,220 --> 01:15:00,470
我不知道
I never knew. I don't know.

833
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,850
- 我对天发誓 - 对我发誓
- I swear to God. - Swear to me!

834
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:11,510
我一直都不知道
I don't... I don't know. I never knew. Never.

835
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:15,240
那批毒品先送去给另一个人
They went to some guy for a couple days before they went to the dealers.

836
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:16,650
为什么？
Why?

837
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:20,980
他在毒品里加了其它的料
There was something... Something else in the drugs...

838
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,660
- 不知名的料 - 什么料？
...something hidden. - What?

839
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:26,250
我只知道那批货被送到奈何岛
I never went to the drop-off point. It was in the Narrows.

840
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:29,680
- 警察只有成群结队武装起来才敢去 - 我像是警察吗？
- Cops only go there in force. - Do I look like a cop?

841
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:31,580
不！
No...!

842
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,230
就是这箱货柜
This is the one I'm talking about.

843
01:15:47,450 --> 01:15:49,810
- 有问题吗？ - 它不该存在的
- What's your problem with it? - It shouldn't exist.

844
01:15:49,890 --> 01:15:53,920
从新加坡出发时只有２４６箱 现在却有２４７箱
This ship left Singapore with 246 containers, but arrived with 247.

845
01:15:53,930 --> 01:15:56,140
这里面一定有违禁品
I'm guessing there's something I'm not supposed to find in there.

846
01:15:56,230 --> 01:16:00,010
我们不敢查费康尼老大的货柜
Listen, counselor, we don't wanna know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.

847
01:16:00,030 --> 01:16:03,500
现在情况不同了，快打开来
Things are working a little differently now. Open it up.

848
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:12,210
(韦恩企业)
What the hell is this?

849
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:14,250
这到底是什么？
It's you, isn't it? Everybody's been talking about you.

850
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:00,100
就是你，大家都在说你
Get in here!

851
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:02,380
快进来！
The other kids won't believe me.

852
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:05,120
别的小朋友一定不相信的
Get rid of all traces.

853
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:30,340
湮灭所有证据
Better torch the whole place. CRANE: All right.

854
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:33,580
- 放火把这地方烧掉 - 好吧
Having trouble?

855
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:11,360
你不舒服吗？
Take a seat. Have a drink.

856
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:14,450
坐下来，喝口水
You look like a man who takes himself too seriously.

857
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:18,420
你看起来火气很大
Do you want my opinion? You need to lighten up.

858
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:25,110
我觉得你应该降降火气
Alfred, help me.

859
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:20,820
阿福？ 阿福？
Blood. Take. Take poison. Blood poison.

860
01:19:30,570 --> 01:19:34,080
我中了毒…替我验血
Poisonous. Poisonous.

861
01:19:34,110 --> 01:19:37,200
中毒，中毒了
Bruce...

862
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:43,180
布鲁斯
... why do we fall?

863
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:45,630
布鲁斯，我们为什么跌倒？
- How long was I out? - Two days.

864
01:19:57,550 --> 01:20:01,030
- 我昏迷了多久？ - 两天
It's your birthday.

865
01:20:01,290 --> 01:20:03,240
今天是你生日
Many happy returns.

866
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:05,770
祝你生日幸福快乐
I've felt these effects before, but this was so much more potent.

867
01:20:10,930 --> 01:20:14,930
我有过这种经验，这次更强烈
It was some kind of hallucinogen, weaponized, in aerosol form.

868
01:20:14,930 --> 01:20:19,670
这是一种迷幻药 被做成喷剂当作武器
You have been hanging out in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.

869
01:20:19,670 --> 01:20:22,760
你一定是在夜店被人下了药
I called Mr. Fox when your condition worsened after the first day.

870
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,990
是我把福克斯先生请来
FOX: I analyzed your blood...

871
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:31,280
我替你验血，把接受体合成物 和蛋白质催化素分离出来
...isolating the receptor compounds and the protein-based catalyst.

872
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:33,110
你能不能说白话？
Am I meant to understand any of that?

873
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:36,740
可以，我费了好一番功夫
Not at all. I just wanted you to know how hard it was.

874
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:41,030
- 终於制造出一种抗体 - 你可以制造更多吗？
- Bottom line, I synthesized an antidote. - Could you make more?

875
01:20:41,050 --> 01:20:43,860
你打算再吸毒吗？
You planning on gassing yourself again, Mr. Wayne?

876
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:47,140
你也知道，泡夜店狂欢
Well, you know how it is. You're out at night, looking for kicks...

877
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:50,070
总是有被下迷幻药的风险
...someone's passing around the weaponized hallucinogens...

878
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:53,700
我把手上有的给你 注射抗体后就不怕被下药
I'll bring what I have. The antidote should inoculate you for now.

879
01:20:53,730 --> 01:20:56,230
阿福，很高兴见到你
Alfred, always a pleasure.

880
01:20:56,290 --> 01:20:57,990
卢修
Lucius.

881
01:21:02,430 --> 01:21:05,210
- 你真的不进来吗？ - 我得赶回去，请你转交给他
- You sure you don't want to come in? - I have to get back.

882
01:21:05,270 --> 01:21:07,070
谢谢你
- I wanted to leave this. - Thank you.

883
01:21:07,170 --> 01:21:08,590
瑞秋？
Rachel?

884
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:13,270
看来有人在蜡烛两头烧
Looks like someone's been burning the candle at both ends.

885
01:21:13,310 --> 01:21:16,120
- 你昨晚一定玩得很疯 - 今天是我生日
- Must've been quite an occasion. - It is my birthday.

886
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:19,890
我知道，今晚我不能来 我只是来送礼物
I know. I'm sorry I can't come tonight. I was just dropping off your present.

887
01:21:19,910 --> 01:21:23,590
- 你有别的事要忙吗？ - 我的上司失踪了两天
- You've got better plans? - My boss has been missing for days...

888
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:27,500
这代表我要开始找他的屍体
...which means I should probably start by looking...

889
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:29,070
- 瑞秋 - 对不起
...at the bottom of the river. - Rachel.

890
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:33,160
瑞秋道斯
Excuse me.

891
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:37,420
是谁下的命令？ 无论如何都要把克莱恩找来
Rachel Dawes.

892
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:41,560
请李曼医师明天一早交出报告
Who authorized that? Get Crane down there now. Don't take no for an answer.

893
01:21:41,790 --> 01:21:43,700
- 怎么了？ - 费康尼出事了
Call Dr. Lehmann, tell him we need our own assessment to the judge by morning.

894
01:21:43,790 --> 01:21:46,390
克莱恩把费康尼送到精神病院
- What's wrong? - It's Falcone.

895
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:49,580
亚克汉疗养院在奈何岛， 你现在要去？
Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum on suicide watch.

896
01:21:50,730 --> 01:21:52,640
你去狂欢吧，布鲁斯
You're going to Arkham now? It's in the Narrows, Rachel.

897
01:21:52,730 --> 01:21:55,580
- 我得去工作 - 你千万要小心
You enjoy your party, Bruce.

898
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:58,890
生日快乐
- Some of us have work to do. - You be careful.

899
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:08,530
(谁找到就是谁的)
Happy birthday.

900
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:20,430
少爷，客人就快来了
But, Master Wayne, the guests will be arriving.

901
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,180
趁我回来之前
Keep them happy until I arrive.

902
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:24,570
说笑话给他们听
Tell them that joke you know.

903
01:23:03,310 --> 01:23:05,080
玩得开心吗？
Having fun?

904
01:23:07,150 --> 01:23:10,900
比尔？ 你这大人物怎么会跑来这里？
Bill? Now, what's a big shot like you doing in a place like this?

905
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:12,230
我要一些资料
I need some information.

906
01:23:12,350 --> 01:23:17,360
韦恩企业４７Ｂ、１ＭＥ型产品
The Wayne Enterprise 47-B, 1-ME.

907
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:20,080
１ＭＥ型
1- ME.

908
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:24,010
能够蒸发敌人供水的微波发射器
It's a microwave emitter. It was designed to vaporize an enemy's water supply.

909
01:23:24,030 --> 01:23:28,430
听说被实验用来在空中散播化学物
Rumor was they tested dispersing water-based chemicals into the air...

910
01:23:28,430 --> 01:23:30,480
这不是不合法吗？
...but isn't that illegal?

911
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:36,500
我要这项实验的所有资料
I want all the information on the development of this project...

912
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:40,660
立刻把备份档案和文件送来
...all data, files, backup disks, on my desk right away.

913
01:23:40,910 --> 01:23:42,640
你弄丢了吗？
Did you lose one?

914
01:23:43,610 --> 01:23:47,390
我要把这部门和档案部合并
I'm merging your department with Archives.

915
01:23:48,450 --> 01:23:49,800
我也要开除你
And I am firing you.

916
01:23:51,850 --> 01:23:53,990
你没收到通知吗？
Didn't you get the memo?

917
01:24:01,090 --> 01:24:02,820
稻草人
Scarecrow.

918
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:08,000
稻草人
Scarecrow.

919
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:12,540
稻草人
Scarecrow.

920
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,890
道斯小姐，你不必来这里
Miss Dawes, this is most irregular.

921
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:20,990
我把报告都交给法官了
I have nothing to add to the report I filed with the judge.

922
01:24:21,030 --> 01:24:23,390
- 你的报告有疑点 - 什么疑点？
- I have questions about your report. - Such as?

923
01:24:23,470 --> 01:24:27,940
一个没有精神病史的５２岁中年人
Isn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man who has no history of mental illness...

924
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:31,690
怎么会在起诉前突然完全精神崩溃？
...to have a psychotic breakdown just when he's about to be indicted?

925
01:24:31,710 --> 01:24:36,150
你也看到他的病情有多严重
As you can see for yourself, there is nothing convenient about his symptoms.

926
01:24:40,610 --> 01:24:42,070
- 稻草人 - 稻草人是什么？
- Scarecrow. - What's "scarecrow"?

927
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:46,260
产生幻觉的精神病患
Patients suffering delusional episodes often focus their paranoia...

928
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:48,460
都会幻想被外在力量迫害
...on an external tormentor...

929
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:51,880
通常是某种可怕人物
...usually one conforming to Jungian archetypes.

930
01:24:51,990 --> 01:24:54,490
他的幻觉是稻草人
In this case, a scarecrow.

931
01:24:55,860 --> 01:25:00,160
- 他服了药？ - 我专攻精神病药物学
- He's drugged? - Psychopharmacology is my primary field.

932
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:01,620
我强烈支持用药物控制精神疾病
I'm a strong advocate.

933
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:04,750
他在外面呼风唤雨
Outside, he was a giant.

934
01:25:04,830 --> 01:25:07,370
在这里只能乖乖听话
In here, only the mind can grant you power.

935
01:25:07,430 --> 01:25:09,200
你很得意，对吧？
You enjoy the reversal.

936
01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:12,490
我认为精神胜於肉体
I respect the mind's power over the body.

937
01:25:12,530 --> 01:25:14,120
所以我专门治疗精神病患
It's why I do what I do.

938
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:19,340
但我专门把坏人关进牢里 不是住在疯人院
I do what I do to keep thugs like Falcone behind bars, not in therapy.

939
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:22,780
我要另外请医师为他进行诊断
I want my own psychiatric consultant to have full access to Falcone...

940
01:25:22,810 --> 01:25:26,250
包括验血 查出你到底给他吃什么药
...including blood work. Find out what exactly you put him on.

941
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:28,870
- 请他明天一早再来 - 他今晚就会来
- First thing tomorrow, then. - Tonight.

942
01:25:28,950 --> 01:25:32,550
我已经通知了李曼医师
I've already paged Dr. Lehmann at County General.

943
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:35,690
随你便
As you wish.

944
01:25:41,150 --> 01:25:43,170
这里请
This way, please.

945
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:46,000
我要给你看样东西
There's something I think you should see.

946
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:59,500
这里是我们的药厂
This is where we make the medicine.

947
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:10,270
你也该吃一点药，让头脑清醒
Perhaps you should have some, clear your head.

948
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:37,020
谁知道你来这里？
Who knows you're here?

949
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:39,690
谁知道？
Who knows?

950
01:26:46,830 --> 01:26:48,150
他在这里
He's here.

951
01:26:48,270 --> 01:26:49,580
谁？
Who?

952
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:51,720
蝙蝠侠
The Batman.

953
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,450
- 我们该怎么办？ - 有坏人闯进来…
What do we do? - What anyone does...

954
01:26:55,540 --> 01:26:58,420
该怎么办？
...when a prowler comes around.

955
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:01,910
- 报警呀 - 你要把警察找来？
- Call the police. - You want the cops here?

956
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:05,260
警察拿我们没办法
At this point, they can't stop us.

957
01:27:05,310 --> 01:27:08,990
但是蝙蝠侠会坏事
But the Batman has a talent for disruption.

958
01:27:09,010 --> 01:27:12,380
把他逼出去，让警察毙了他
Force him outside, the police will take him down. Go.

959
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:14,600
- 那她怎么办？ - 她没救了
-What about her? -She hasn't got long.

960
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:19,620
我下的药很强 她撑不住的，快去吧
I gave her a concentrated dose. The mind can only take so much. Now go.

961
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,320
听说他很神？
The things they say about him.

962
01:27:24,390 --> 01:27:25,980
他真的会飞吗？
Can he really fly?

963
01:27:26,090 --> 01:27:28,240
我听说他能隐形
I heard he can disappear.

964
01:27:28,330 --> 01:27:31,480
我们很快就会知道
Well, we'll find out.

965
01:27:31,630 --> 01:27:33,360
不是吗？
Won't we?

966
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:22,810
这下你要自食其果了
Taste of your own medicine, doctor?

967
01:28:29,370 --> 01:28:31,350
你在这里搞什么鬼？
What have you been doing here?

968
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:36,840
你替谁工作？
Who are you working for?

969
01:28:41,180 --> 01:28:43,640
忍者…忍者大师
Ra's... Ra's al Ghul.

970
01:28:43,710 --> 01:28:48,750
忍者大师死了，你替谁工作？
Ra's al Ghul is dead. Who are you working for?

971
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:49,810
克莱恩？
Crane.

972
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:55,340
克莱恩医师不在
Dr. Crane isn't here right now.

973
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:57,770
如果你想预约挂号…
But if you'd like to make an appointment...

974
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:13,720
蝙蝠侠，放下武器投降
Batman, put down your weapons and surrender.

975
01:29:14,330 --> 01:29:15,790
你被包围了
You're surrounded.

976
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:24,190
- 你还在等什么？ - 支援警力
- What are you waiting for? - Backup.

977
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:27,310
- 支援警力？ - 蝙蝠侠在里面
- Backup? - The Batman's in there.

978
01:29:27,370 --> 01:29:29,630
霹雳小组正赶来，如果你想冲进去…
SWAT's on the way. But if you wanna go in now...

979
01:29:29,710 --> 01:29:31,300
我们会跟着你
...I'll be right behind you, sir.

980
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:34,370
等霹雳小组来了再说
SWAT's on the way.

981
01:29:35,380 --> 01:29:36,730
- 喂 - 喂
- Hey. - Hey.

982
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:20,940
她怎么了？
What's happened to her?

983
01:30:23,550 --> 01:30:27,510
她被克莱恩下了迷幻药 引发严重的恐慌症
Crane poisoned her with a psychotropic hallucinogen, a panic-inducing toxin.

984
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:33,240
- 我把她送到医院 - 没有用，我能救她
- Let me get her down to the medics. - They can't help her, but I can.

985
01:30:36,990 --> 01:30:39,270
把她抱下去，在小巷等我
Get her downstairs. Meet me in the alley.

986
01:30:47,130 --> 01:30:50,150
费康尼也被克莱恩下了药
Crane's been smuggling his toxin hidden in Falcone's drugs...

987
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:52,450
他也在高谭市的自来水管下药
...and they're dumping it into the water supply.

988
01:30:52,870 --> 01:30:54,600
- 他想干什么？ - 我不知道
- What was he planning? - I don't know.

989
01:30:54,730 --> 01:30:56,120
他替费康尼工作吗？
Was he working for Falcone?

990
01:30:56,530 --> 01:30:59,170
他提到另一个更可怕的人
He mentioned someone else, someone worse.

991
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:01,900
我得赶快为她注射抗体
She needs the antidote before the damage is permanent.

992
01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:04,260
- 她还有多久时间？ - 不久
- How long does she have? - Not long.

993
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:09,950
那是什么声音？
What is that?

994
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:13,600
- 支援来了 - 搞什么？
- Backup. - What the...?

995
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,620
抱歉
Excuse me.

996
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:41,710
- 她怎么样？ - 她昏过去了，快走吧
How is she? - She's fading. We gotta go.

997
01:32:43,370 --> 01:32:44,900
我去开车
I'll get my car.

998
01:32:45,010 --> 01:32:46,910
我开了我的车
I brought mine.

999
01:32:47,210 --> 01:32:48,940
你的车？
Yours?

1000
01:32:58,180 --> 01:33:00,090
我也要弄一辆这么炫的车
I've gotta get me one of those.

1001
01:33:01,250 --> 01:33:03,470
- 他开车逃走 - 车款和颜色？
-He is in a vehicle. -Make and color?

1002
01:33:03,590 --> 01:33:06,050
那是辆黑色的…
It's a black...

1003
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:08,610
装甲车
...tank.

1004
01:33:11,190 --> 01:33:12,610
保持冷静
Stay calm.

1005
01:33:13,230 --> 01:33:15,100
你中毒了
You've been poisoned.

1006
01:33:17,730 --> 01:33:19,120
我追上去了
I'm on him.

1007
01:33:27,470 --> 01:33:28,570
慢慢呼吸
Breathe slowly.

1008
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:39,820
撑着点
Hold on.

1009
01:33:54,220 --> 01:33:55,680
- 你在干嘛？ - 抄近路
- What are you doing? - Shortcut.

1010
01:34:04,090 --> 01:34:05,970
挡住他的去路
Air One to ground, block that ramp.

1011
01:34:10,470 --> 01:34:12,120
他无处可逃
He's got no way off that roof.

1012
01:34:13,470 --> 01:34:16,690
马上熄火，乖乖下车
Turn off your engine. Step away from the car.

1013
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:21,820
- 相信我 - 启动武器系统
- Trust me. -Weapons system activated.

1014
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:40,940
这家伙到底是谁？
Who is this guy?

1015
01:34:41,190 --> 01:34:42,990
- 他去哪里？ - 他在屋顶
-Where's he going? -He's on the roof.

1016
01:34:57,300 --> 01:34:59,620
- 他走哪一条街？ - 不在街上
-What street is he taking? - He's not on a street.

1017
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:01,500
他在屋顶上开车
He's flying on rooftops.

1018
01:35:40,590 --> 01:35:42,950
他的车到底长什么样子？
At least tell me what it looks like.

1019
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:47,430
算了
Never mind.

1020
01:35:51,230 --> 01:35:52,660
追上了
Got him.

1021
01:36:03,470 --> 01:36:05,130
我们就跟在他后面
Coming right up on his butt.

1022
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:32,300
嫌犯朝往州际公路开去
We're tracking suspect vehicle heading west on I- 17.

1023
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:39,230
- 呼叫地面… - 他甩掉我们了
- Air One to ground.  - I lost him.

1024
01:36:39,330 --> 01:36:41,310
我们失去他的踪影， 九号出口已封闭
We've lost visual. Exit 9 is blocked.

1025
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:43,480
我们去前面查查看
We'll loop back to check the frontage road.

1026
01:36:43,570 --> 01:36:45,750
启动秘密行动模式
Stealth mode activated.

1027
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:47,620
保持清醒
Stay with me.

1028
01:36:53,740 --> 01:36:55,300
他在那里
What...? There he is.

1029
01:37:14,890 --> 01:37:16,420
撑着点
Just hold on.

1030
01:37:20,330 --> 01:37:21,570
瑞秋！
Rachel!

1031
01:37:35,770 --> 01:37:38,400
(福克斯给您的，阿福笔)


1032
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:56,710
- 自来水管被下了毒药吗？ - 没错
-They get any of this into the mains? -Yeah.

1033
01:37:56,820 --> 01:37:59,810
通知自来水厂，一定有办法… 全市的供水系统都被下药
-Notify the water company. There's gotta be a way to isolate it. -No. They put it all in.

1034
01:37:59,850 --> 01:38:02,840
他们一定花了几个星期下药
They must've been at this for weeks.

1035
01:38:02,890 --> 01:38:05,140
已经溶入全市的供水系统了
Gotham's entire water supply is laced.

1036
01:38:05,220 --> 01:38:06,540
我们为什么没中毒？
Why haven't we felt the effects?

1037
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:09,050
这种毒药必须从肺部吸入
Must be a compound that has to be absorbed through the lungs.

1038
01:38:19,170 --> 01:38:20,930
你感觉如何？
How do you feel?

1039
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:25,170
这是那里？
Where are we?

1040
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:29,560
- 你为什么把我带来？ - 我把你救回来，否则你就失常了
- Why did you bring me here? - If I hadn't, your mind would be lost.

1041
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:31,720
- 你中了毒 - 是…
- You were poisoned. - It was...

1042
01:38:31,810 --> 01:38:35,560
- 是克莱恩下的药 - 好好休息，克莱恩被戈登逮捕了
- It was Dr. Crane. - Rest. Gordon has Crane.

1043
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:37,790
戈登警官是你的朋友吗？
Is Sergeant Gordon your friend?

1044
01:38:38,550 --> 01:38:40,280
我不能有任何朋友
I don't have the luxury of friends.

1045
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:44,560
我给你打镇定剂 你醒来后就会在你家
I'm gonna give you a sedative. You'll wake up back at home.

1046
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:48,710
然后你要把这些交给戈登 千万不要相信别人
When you do, get these to Gordon, and Gordon alone. Trust no one.

1047
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:50,520
- 这是什么？ - 毒药的抗体
- What are they? - The antidote.

1048
01:38:50,620 --> 01:38:54,090
一瓶给戈登，另一瓶大量制造
One for Gordon to inoculate himself, the other for mass production.

1049
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:55,710
大量制造？
Mass production?

1050
01:38:55,830 --> 01:38:59,120
克莱恩只是爪牙，我们要准备应战
Crane was just a pawn. We need to be ready.

1051
01:39:25,110 --> 01:39:28,710
当你说你想拯救高谭市
When you told me your grand plan for saving Gotham...

1052
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:31,730
我没把你送进疯人院是因为…
...all that stopped me from calling the men in white coats...

1053
01:39:31,780 --> 01:39:34,350
你说你不是为了追求刺激
...was when you said it wasn't about thrill-seeking.

1054
01:39:34,420 --> 01:39:37,610
- 我并不是 - 那这算什么？
- It's not. - What would you call that?

1055
01:39:37,650 --> 01:39:38,930
(高速公路大追击)


1056
01:39:39,350 --> 01:39:42,060
- 很精采的新闻 - 没有人受伤是个奇蹟
- Damn good television. - It's a miracle no one was killed.

1057
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:46,050
我没时间遵守交通规则
I didn't have time to observe the rules of the road, Alfred.

1058
01:39:46,060 --> 01:39:49,280
你一手创造了一个怪物
You're getting lost inside this monster of yours.

1059
01:39:49,330 --> 01:39:53,920
我利用这个怪物帮助人们 就跟我父亲一样
I'm using this monster to help other people, just like my father did.

1060
01:39:53,930 --> 01:39:55,550
你父亲那么做
For Thomas Wayne, helping others...

1061
01:39:55,660 --> 01:39:58,690
不是为了证明给任何人看， 包括他自己
...wasn't about proving anything to anyone, including himself.

1062
01:39:59,030 --> 01:40:02,580
我是为了瑞秋，她中了毒
It's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying.

1063
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:05,500
她就在楼下，请你送她回家
She's downstairs, sedated. I need you to take her home.

1064
01:40:05,870 --> 01:40:09,510
我们都很关心瑞秋 但你已失去控制
Well, we both care for Rachel, but what you're doing has to be beyond that.

1065
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:12,730
为了徇私，就会变成恶徒
It can't be personal, or you're just a vigilante.

1066
01:40:12,780 --> 01:40:14,760
- 福克斯还在吗？ - 在
- Is Fox still here? - Yes, sir.

1067
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:16,500
我们要把这些客人赶走
We need to send these people away.

1068
01:40:16,610 --> 01:40:19,670
你不能毁了布鲁斯韦恩的名誉
Those are Bruce Wayne's guests. You have a name to maintain.

1069
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:21,700
我不在乎我的名誉
I don't care about my name.

1070
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:25,080
不只是你，也是你父亲的名誉
It's not just your name, sir. It's your father's name.

1071
01:40:26,690 --> 01:40:29,150
他只留下他的名誉
And it's all that's left of him.

1072
01:40:30,990 --> 01:40:32,610
千万别毁了他的名誉
Don't destroy it.

1073
01:40:47,870 --> 01:40:50,120
- 厄尔先生 - 生日快乐
- Mr. Earle. - Happy birthday, Bruce.

1074
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:51,700
谢谢你
Thank you.

1075
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:54,050
公司的股价如何？
How did the stock offering go?

1076
01:40:54,210 --> 01:40:55,490
涨停板
Prices soared.

1077
01:40:55,610 --> 01:40:56,890
股票都是谁在买？
Who was buying?

1078
01:40:57,010 --> 01:40:59,020
基金和证券公司
All kinds of funds and brokerages.

1079
01:40:59,110 --> 01:41:00,870
你不会懂的
It's a bit technical.

1080
01:41:00,980 --> 01:41:02,740
重点是
The key thing is...

1081
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:07,850
- 公司的未来很稳定 - 那就好
-...our company's future is secure. -Great.

1082
01:41:21,460 --> 01:41:23,820
她只是喝多了几杯
A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid.

1083
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:31,300
你的计划是什么？
What was the plan, Crane?

1084
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:33,760
你怎么把毒药释放在空气中？
How were you gonna get your toxin into the air?

1085
01:41:34,030 --> 01:41:37,470
稻草人，稻草人
Scarecrow. Scarecrow.

1086
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:39,410
替谁工作？
Who were you working for, Crane?

1087
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:43,690
太迟了
Oh, it's too late.

1088
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:46,420
你阻止不了他
You can't stop it now.

1089
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:52,960
拿去
Here.

1090
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,350
- 生日快乐，布鲁斯 - 谢谢各位
Happy birthday, Bruce. - Thank you. Thanks.

1091
01:41:55,450 --> 01:41:58,500
谢谢你的那样东西
And thank you for that item.

1092
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:01,160
不客气
You're welcome.

1093
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:04,200
- 我知道你会用来救人 - 我已经救了一个人
- I know you'll put it to good use. - I already have.

1094
01:42:04,350 --> 01:42:08,350
如果要大量制造要多久时间？
How long would it take to manufacture on a large scale?

1095
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:09,860
几个星期，为什么问？
Weeks. Why?

1096
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:13,290
有人想利用自来水散播毒素
Somebody's planning to disperse the toxin using the water supply.

1097
01:42:14,160 --> 01:42:17,380
自来水不能让人吸入毒素
The water supply won't help you disperse an inhalant.

1098
01:42:18,190 --> 01:42:19,650
什么？
What?

1099
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:22,360
除非用微波发射器
Unless you have a microwave emitter powerful enough...

1100
01:42:22,430 --> 01:42:25,490
把水分蒸发
...to vaporize all the water in the mains.

1101
01:42:25,770 --> 01:42:29,200
就是韦恩企业弄丢的那一台
A microwave emitter like the one Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.

1102
01:42:29,470 --> 01:42:30,750
弄丢了？
Misplaced?

1103
01:42:30,870 --> 01:42:34,470
我多问几句就被厄尔开除
Earle just fired me for asking too many questions about it.

1104
01:42:36,370 --> 01:42:40,010
我要你回公司大量制造抗体
Go back to Wayne Enterprises now and start making more of that antidote.

1105
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:43,230
警方会需要大量的抗体
The police are gonna need as much as they can get their hands on.

1106
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:45,500
我公司的保全卡被没收了
My security clearance has been revoked.

1107
01:42:45,580 --> 01:42:47,650
你一定会有办法，对吧？
That wouldn't stop a man like you, would it?

1108
01:42:47,980 --> 01:42:49,780
我猜是吧
I suppose not.

1109
01:42:51,750 --> 01:42:56,590
- 布鲁斯，你一定要见一个人 - 我现在没空
- Bruce, there's somebody you must meet. - Not now, Mrs. Delane.

1110
01:42:56,590 --> 01:42:59,580
听听我念得对不对…
Now, am I pronouncing this right...

1111
01:42:59,620 --> 01:43:02,190
忍者大师？
...Mr. Ra's al Ghul?

1112
01:43:07,690 --> 01:43:09,570
你才不是忍者大师
You're not Ra's al Ghul.

1113
01:43:11,030 --> 01:43:12,380
我亲眼看到他死
I watched him die.

1114
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:15,690
也许忍者大师不会死？
But is Ra's al Ghul immortal?

1115
01:43:18,300 --> 01:43:20,870
也许他有特异功能？
Are his methods supernatural?

1116
01:43:25,310 --> 01:43:29,900
也许你才是真正的忍者大师吧？
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal your true identity, Ra's?

1117
01:43:31,580 --> 01:43:36,250
你自己在晚上化身为正义使者
Surely a man who spends his nights scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...

1118
01:43:36,250 --> 01:43:38,360
应该不会怪我有双重身分吧？
...wouldn't begrudge me dual identities.

1119
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:40,990
我救了你一命
I saved your life.

1120
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:43,680
我教过你不能对敌人手下留情
I warned you about compassion, Bruce.

1121
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:49,050
你要对付的是我
Your quarrel is with me.

1122
01:43:49,820 --> 01:43:52,420
放过这些人
You let these people go.

1123
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:56,000
尽管去跟他们解释吧
You are welcome to explain the situation to them.

1124
01:43:58,130 --> 01:43:59,820
各位
Everyone.

1125
01:44:00,530 --> 01:44:02,510
各位来宾请听我说
Everybody?

1126
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,940
我…
I...

1127
01:44:07,340 --> 01:44:11,750
要谢谢你们喝光我的酒
I want to thank you all for coming here tonight and drinking all of my booze.

1128
01:44:13,670 --> 01:44:15,440
我是说真的
No, really.

1129
01:44:16,410 --> 01:44:19,290
像我这种亿万大富翁
There's a thing about being a Wayne...

1130
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:23,060
免不了会有很多人来白吃白喝
...that you're never short of a few freeloaders, like yourselves...

1131
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:26,930
我敬大家，谢谢各位
...to fill up your mansion with. So here's to you people. Thank you.

1132
01:44:26,950 --> 01:44:29,650
- 够了，布鲁斯 - 我还没说完
- That's enough, Bruce. - I'm not finished.

1133
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:31,650
你们这些…
To all of you...

1134
01:44:31,750 --> 01:44:36,320
你们这些伪君子 你们这些酒肉朋友
All of you phonies, all of you two-faced friends...

1135
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:41,560
装一副笑脸，一心想讨好我
...you sycophantic suck-ups who smile through your teeth at me...

1136
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:45,310
请你们别再来烦我
...please, leave me in peace.

1137
01:44:45,330 --> 01:44:48,070
请你们走吧
Please go.

1138
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:51,840
我不是开玩笑，快走吧
Stop smiling, it's not a joke. Please leave.

1139
01:44:51,870 --> 01:44:54,150
派对结束了，快滚
The party's over, get out.

1140
01:44:54,230 --> 01:44:57,640
你丢尽了你父母的脸，韦恩先生
The apple has fallen very far from the tree, Mr. Wayne.

1141
01:45:10,910 --> 01:45:12,750
很有意思
Amusing.

1142
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:16,560
但是没有用 这些人都活不久了
But pointless. None of these people have long to live.

1143
01:45:16,580 --> 01:45:20,220
你对疗养院的注意 逼我不得不提早行动
Your antics at the asylum have forced my hand.

1144
01:45:20,250 --> 01:45:22,500
克莱恩果然是为你做事
So Crane was working for you.

1145
01:45:22,590 --> 01:45:26,580
他利用蓝花提炼毒药
His toxin is derived from the organic compound found in our blue flowers.

1146
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:28,900
然后做成化学武器
He was able to weaponize it.

1147
01:45:28,990 --> 01:45:31,040
他不是影武者联盟成员？
He's not a member of the League of Shadows?

1148
01:45:31,130 --> 01:45:35,880
当然不是 他以为我们要勒索高谭市
Of course not. He thought our plan was to hold the city to ransom.

1149
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:41,100
但是你其实要在高谭市下毒
But really, you are gonna release Crane's poison on the entire city.

1150
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:45,300
然后看着市民因为恐惧自我毁灭
Then watch Gotham tear itself apart through fear.

1151
01:45:58,010 --> 01:45:59,990
你打算害死数百万条人命
You're gonna destroy millions of lives.

1152
01:46:00,110 --> 01:46:03,590
这些人活着也是痛苦
Only a cynical man would call what these people have "lives," Wayne.

1153
01:46:03,610 --> 01:46:05,520
他们饱受犯罪荼毒
Crime. Despair.

1154
01:46:05,620 --> 01:46:07,800
活着还有什么意思呢？
This is not how man was supposed to live.

1155
01:46:08,350 --> 01:46:11,610
数千年来我们影武者联盟都在…
The League of Shadows has been a check against human corruption...

1156
01:46:11,650 --> 01:46:13,210
清除人间败类
...for thousands of years.

1157
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:17,070
我们在古罗马制造瘟疫
We sacked Rome. Loaded trade ships with plague rats.

1158
01:46:17,090 --> 01:46:18,550
把伦敦夷为平地
Burned London to the ground.

1159
01:46:18,660 --> 01:46:21,610
每当人类文明腐败到极点
Every time a civilization reaches the pinnacle of its decadence...

1160
01:46:21,660 --> 01:46:23,710
我们就会将它毁灭
...we return to restore the balance.

1161
01:46:23,790 --> 01:46:25,450
高谭市还有得救
Gotham isn't beyond saving.

1162
01:46:26,700 --> 01:46:29,510
再给我时间，这里还有好人
Give me more time. There are good people here.

1163
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:34,950
这个城市无药可救了 我们渗透了每一个阶层
You're defending a city so corrupt we have infiltrated every level of its infrastructure.

1164
01:46:45,810 --> 01:46:47,270
该出去玩了
Time to play.

1165
01:46:51,380 --> 01:46:54,150
我在牢里看到你时，你迷失了自我
When I found you in that jail, you were lost.

1166
01:46:54,210 --> 01:46:56,400
但是我相信你
But I believed in you.

1167
01:46:56,480 --> 01:47:00,410
我消除你的恐惧，指引你方向
I took away your fear, and I showed you a path.

1168
01:47:00,490 --> 01:47:02,840
你是我最好的徒弟
You were my greatest student.

1169
01:47:03,020 --> 01:47:06,320
你应该站在我身边拯救世界
It should be you standing by my side, saving the world.

1170
01:47:06,990 --> 01:47:09,730
我要站在你面前
I'll be standing where I belong.

1171
01:47:10,260 --> 01:47:13,520
阻止你屠杀高谭市市民
Between you and the people of Gotham.

1172
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:17,770
没有人救得了高谭市
No one can save Gotham.

1173
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:25,860
当森林腐烂，野火会把它烧光
When a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural.

1174
01:47:26,870 --> 01:47:31,730
明天是这座伟大城市的末日
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror as its greatest city destroys itself.

1175
01:47:32,110 --> 01:47:35,470
这次没有人能阻止我
The movement back to harmony will be unstoppable this time.

1176
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:37,930
- 你曾经试过毁灭高谭市？ - 当然了
- You attacked Gotham before? - Of course.

1177
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:40,820
我们使用的方法越来越成熟
Over the ages our weapons have grown more sophisticated.

1178
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:43,900
我们曾经造成经济大萧条
With Gotham we tried a new one. Economics.

1179
01:47:44,180 --> 01:47:49,080
但是我们低估了像你父母这种…
But we underestimated certain of Gotham's citizens...

1180
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:51,610
善心人士的力量
...such as your parents.

1181
01:47:55,590 --> 01:47:59,190
结果他们竟被帮助的对象打死
Gunned down by one of the very people they were trying to help.

1182
01:47:59,330 --> 01:48:02,240
老百姓没饭吃被迫当强盗
Create enough hunger and everyone becomes a criminal.

1183
01:48:02,290 --> 01:48:04,870
你父母的死让高谭市民心连心
Their deaths galvanized the city into saving itself...

1184
01:48:04,930 --> 01:48:07,740
勉强撑到现在
...and Gotham has limped on ever since.

1185
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:09,640
我们要来完成任务
We are back to finish the job.

1186
01:48:10,300 --> 01:48:13,670
这次不会有理想主义者碍事
And this time no misguided idealists will get in the way.

1187
01:48:13,700 --> 01:48:17,450
你跟你爸一样狠不下心
Like your father, you lack the courage to do all that is necessary.

1188
01:48:17,570 --> 01:48:20,590
如果有人敢阻止我们伸张正义
If someone stands in the way of true justice...

1189
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:24,870
我们就从背后捅他们一刀
...you simply walk up behind them and stab them in the heart.

1190
01:48:29,710 --> 01:48:31,960
- 我要阻止你的恶行 - 你学不会…
- I am gonna stop you. - You never did learn...

1191
01:48:32,050 --> 01:48:34,160
耳听四面、眼观八方
...to mind your surroundings.

1192
01:48:36,280 --> 01:48:38,360
正义就是有仇必报
Justice is balance.

1193
01:48:38,450 --> 01:48:40,700
你烧了我房子，差点害死我
You burned my house and left me for dead.

1194
01:48:43,290 --> 01:48:45,510
这下我们算扯平了
Consider us even.

1195
01:49:01,830 --> 01:49:03,640
确定没有人活着出来
No one comes out. Make sure.

1196
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:14,970
他们都逃出去了？
They're all gone?

1197
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:17,960
- 有多少重度病患逃出去？ - 全部都逃出去
- How many from maximum security? - Every one of them.

1198
01:49:18,010 --> 01:49:19,850
连环杀手、强暴犯
Serial killers, rapists.

1199
01:49:20,010 --> 01:49:22,970
把桥梁升起，别让他们进城
Raise the bridges. We don't want any getting off the island.

1200
01:49:23,020 --> 01:49:24,510
好吧，就这么办
I'll raise the bridges...

1201
01:49:24,620 --> 01:49:29,050
等支援警力来把那些神经病抓走
...when I get every available unit out here to catch the homicidal maniacs...

1202
01:49:29,050 --> 01:49:32,080
- 到时候再说吧 - 快去吧
...that are running loose out there. - Come on!

1203
01:49:55,100 --> 01:49:57,980
希望你不是消防队员
I hope you're not a member of the fire brigade.

1204
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:06,060
韦恩少爷！
Master Wayne! Master Wayne!

1205
01:50:10,510 --> 01:50:15,070
你成天健身连木头都抬不动？
What is the point of all those pushups if you can't even lift a bloody log?

1206
01:50:53,510 --> 01:50:55,690
我到底做了什么？
What have I done, Alfred?

1207
01:50:56,610 --> 01:50:58,630
韦恩宅邸…
Everything my family...

1208
01:50:58,710 --> 01:51:00,730
我父亲的心血…
...my father, built...

1209
01:51:03,020 --> 01:51:07,120
韦恩家族的精神不只是砖块瓦砾
The Wayne legacy is more than bricks and mortar, sir.

1210
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:09,440
我想要拯救高谭市
I wanted to save Gotham.

1211
01:51:10,190 --> 01:51:12,170
我失败了
I failed.

1212
01:51:13,290 --> 01:51:14,640
我们为什么跌倒？
Why do we fall, sir?

1213
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:21,360
这样才能学会站起来
So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.

1214
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:25,950
你还是没放弃我，是吗？
You still haven't given up on me?

1215
01:51:27,770 --> 01:51:29,320
永远都不会
Never.

1216
01:51:30,300 --> 01:51:31,690
趴下来
Down!

1217
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:34,860
警察暴力，警察动粗
Harassment! I see harassment!

1218
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:37,010
你想看真正的警察暴力吗？
Maybe you'd like to see some excessive force?

1219
01:51:37,110 --> 01:51:39,120
拿了枪的疯子
Madman with a gun.

1220
01:51:40,270 --> 01:51:43,610
市民对警方镇压行动…
With residents furious...

1221
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:45,200
感到愤怒
... at the unprecedented show of police strength to round up the inmates...

1222
01:51:45,310 --> 01:51:47,220
我们要把桥梁升起来
We're about to raise these bridges.

1223
01:51:47,310 --> 01:51:51,060
我是检察官，让我过去
Officer, I am a Gotham City district attorney. Let me pass.

1224
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:00,720
- 给我闭嘴！ - 佛莱斯，别激动！
- Just shut up! - Hey, Flass, cool it!

1225
01:52:00,790 --> 01:52:02,100
冷静点
Hold these people back.

1226
01:52:02,220 --> 01:52:05,340
戈登，有人来找你
Hey, Gordon. Somebody here to see you.

1227
01:52:05,390 --> 01:52:07,860
- 你跑来干嘛？ - 我们的朋友要我交给你
- What are you doing here? - Our friend sent me with this.

1228
01:52:07,930 --> 01:52:09,510
这是解药
It counteracts Crane's toxin.

1229
01:52:09,630 --> 01:52:11,160
希望你用不着
Hopefully you won't need it.

1230
01:52:11,260 --> 01:52:14,560
除非有人把毒药释放在空气中
Not unless he's got some way of getting that crap into the air.

1231
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:18,140
好了，不准过桥了
All right, last one across.

1232
01:52:18,700 --> 01:52:22,800
三分钟内就要把桥梁升起来
People, they want this bridge up in no more than three minutes!

1233
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:26,350
你最好赶快离开这里
Better get you off the island before they raise the bridges. Patrolman!

1234
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:27,870
快走吧
Go!

1235
01:52:54,660 --> 01:52:56,570
我找不到我妈妈
I can't find my mom.

1236
01:52:56,790 --> 01:52:58,380
喂！
Hey!

1237
01:53:06,700 --> 01:53:08,500
你想干什么？
What the hell are you doing?

1238
01:53:09,940 --> 01:53:11,590
各位
Gentlemen...

1239
01:53:11,940 --> 01:53:14,610
我们该行动了
...time to spread the word.

1240
01:53:16,210 --> 01:53:17,660
我们要引起一阵…
And the word is...

1241
01:53:18,870 --> 01:53:20,680
大恐慌
...panic.

1242
01:53:43,460 --> 01:53:44,560
(自来水厂)


1243
01:53:44,690 --> 01:53:46,350
水压突然上升
Jesus. The pressure, it's spiking.

1244
01:53:47,290 --> 01:53:48,680
就在那里
Right there.

1245
01:53:48,930 --> 01:53:51,290
那是奈何岛的地下水管
That water main is right under the Narrows.

1246
01:54:08,110 --> 01:54:09,730
没事了
It's okay.

1247
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:44,120
我是罗局长
This is Commissioner Loeb.

1248
01:54:44,230 --> 01:54:46,000
快向我报告
Come on, somebody talk to me.

1249
01:54:46,100 --> 01:54:47,630
说话啊！
Come on!

1250
01:55:07,310 --> 01:55:09,460
罗局长，我是戈登
Loeb, Loeb. This is Gordon.

1251
01:55:09,650 --> 01:55:11,070
到底发生什么事？
What the hell is going on?

1252
01:55:11,180 --> 01:55:14,770
我们需要支援，镇暴警察、霹雳小组
We need reinforcements. TAC teams, SWAT, riot cops!

1253
01:55:14,790 --> 01:55:19,190
戈登，镇暴警察都在你那里
Gordon! All the city's riot police are on the island with you!

1254
01:55:19,190 --> 01:55:21,300
他们都中了毒
Well, they're completely incapacitated!

1255
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:25,650
没事了，没人会伤害你
It's okay, it's okay. No one's gonna hurt you.

1256
01:55:26,360 --> 01:55:28,060
我就会伤害你
Of course they are!

1257
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:31,290
- 克莱恩？ - 不，我是稻草人
- Crane? - No. Scarecrow.

1258
01:55:32,930 --> 01:55:34,390
戈登
Gordon...

1259
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:36,860
没有警力了
...there's nobody left to send in.

1260
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:40,070
只剩下我一个人？
So I'm on my own?

1261
01:55:44,110 --> 01:55:45,840
奈何岛陷入一团混乱
The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces.

1262
01:55:45,940 --> 01:55:48,640
如果他们将毒药释放到全市
This is just the beginning. If they hit the whole city...

1263
01:55:48,710 --> 01:55:51,550
就会引起高谭市的大恐慌
...there's nothing to stop Gotham tearing itself apart.

1264
01:55:51,610 --> 01:55:53,590
- 他们要怎么做？ - 透过铁路系统
- How are they gonna do that? - The train.

1265
01:55:53,680 --> 01:55:57,680
自来水管沿着轨道到韦恩大楼底下
The monorail follows the water mains to the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.

1266
01:55:57,680 --> 01:55:59,480
只要在韦恩大楼发射微波
If the machine gets to the station...

1267
01:55:59,580 --> 01:56:03,190
就会把全市的供水蒸发
...it'll cause a chain reaction that'll vaporize the city's water supply.

1268
01:56:03,220 --> 01:56:04,880
让高谭市充满毒气
Covering Gotham in this poison.

1269
01:56:04,990 --> 01:56:08,320
我需要你帮我阻止他们
I'm gonna stop him from loading that train, but I may need your help.

1270
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:10,230
- 你要我怎么做？ - 你会开手排档吗？
- What do you need? - Can you drive stick?

1271
01:56:16,430 --> 01:56:18,160
你们在这里
There you are!

1272
01:56:18,260 --> 01:56:20,340
除了恐惧本身
There is nothing to fear...

1273
01:56:20,430 --> 01:56:22,230
没什么好怕的
...but fear itself!

1274
01:56:23,230 --> 01:56:25,660
我来帮你们…
I am here to help you!

1275
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:59,010
蝙蝠侠会来救我们
Batman will save us. He'll come.

1276
01:57:04,130 --> 01:57:06,110
- 他一定会来 - 不要看
- He'll come. - Don't peek.

1277
01:57:14,670 --> 01:57:18,180
我是戈登，把桥放下来
This is Gordon. Prepare to lower the bridge.

1278
01:57:23,910 --> 01:57:26,120
我就说他一定会来
I told you he'd come.

1279
01:57:31,050 --> 01:57:32,740
等等
Wait.

1280
01:57:33,650 --> 01:57:35,310
你很可能没命
You could die.

1281
01:57:35,410 --> 01:57:36,770
至少告诉我你是谁
At least tell me your name.

1282
01:57:42,120 --> 01:57:44,410
我在外表底下是谁并不重要
It's not who I am underneath...

1283
01:57:45,290 --> 01:57:48,100
我的所作所为才重要
...but what I do that defines me.

1284
01:57:49,960 --> 01:57:51,310
布鲁斯？
Bruce?

1285
01:58:24,950 --> 01:58:28,460
你真的听我的话，扮成一个怪物
Well, well. You took my advice about theatricality a bit literally.

1286
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:31,060
- 你的恶行到此为止 - 你跟警察才到此为止
- It ends here. - For you and the police, maybe.

1287
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:33,550
我要对付的是整个高谭市
My fight, however, lies with the rest of Gotham.

1288
01:58:33,620 --> 01:58:37,130
恕我失陪，我要摧毁这座城市
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a city to destroy.

1289
01:58:37,160 --> 01:58:41,010
- 你以为我打不过他们？ - 请便吧
- I can't beat two of your pawns? - As you wish.

1290
01:58:53,670 --> 01:58:56,060
全球定位系统连线
GPS online.

1291
01:59:02,810 --> 01:59:05,130
距离一百码
In 100 yards.

1292
01:59:35,900 --> 01:59:37,250
上吧
Gentlemen.

1293
02:00:04,580 --> 02:00:06,910
谁下令把桥放下来？
Who the hell authorized this?

1294
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:19,540
距离韦恩大楼三英哩
Distance to Wayne Tower, three miles.

1295
02:00:26,700 --> 02:00:29,440
水压把沿路的水管炸爆
The pressure's moving along the mains, blowing the pipes.

1296
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:30,920
如果波及自来水厂
If that pressure reaches us...

1297
02:00:31,030 --> 02:00:34,190
全市的自来水管都会爆炸
...the water supply right across the whole city is gonna blow!

1298
02:00:44,510 --> 02:00:47,530
在下一个街口右转
At the next intersection, turn right.

1299
02:01:12,090 --> 02:01:13,590
你永远都学不会
You will never learn.

1300
02:01:21,130 --> 02:01:22,160
不好意思
Sorry.

1301
02:01:26,100 --> 02:01:29,200
- 你没有新的招式吗？ - 这一招怎么样？
- Familiar. Don't you have anything new? - How about this?!

1302
02:01:45,850 --> 02:01:48,250
您已抵达目的地，韦恩大楼
You have arrived at Wayne Tower.

1303
02:02:01,430 --> 02:02:02,740
快疏散整座大楼
Evacuate the building.

1304
02:02:02,900 --> 02:02:05,490
楼下的自来水厂会爆炸
We're on top of the main hub and it's gonna blow.

1305
02:02:14,300 --> 02:02:16,590
启动武器系统
Weapons system activated.

1306
02:02:20,570 --> 02:02:21,600
好厉害的车
Nice ride.

1307
02:02:36,850 --> 02:02:37,880
准备攻击
Armed.

1308
02:02:44,360 --> 02:02:45,640
(水压过高)


1309
02:02:49,790 --> 02:02:51,320
不要怕，布鲁斯
Don't be afraid, Bruce.

1310
02:02:54,060 --> 02:02:55,490
来吧，来吧
Come on. Come on.

1311
02:03:00,200 --> 02:03:02,350
你只是穿着披风的凡人
You are just an ordinary man in a cape.

1312
02:03:02,440 --> 02:03:06,470
不能伸张正义，不能阻止列车
That's why you couldn't fight injustice, that's why you can't stop this train.

1313
02:03:06,470 --> 02:03:09,180
谁说我要阻止列车？
Who said anything about stopping it?

1314
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:16,470
太帅了
Yes!

1315
02:03:24,580 --> 02:03:28,170
你学不会耳听四面、眼观八方
You never learned to mind your surroundings!

1316
02:03:35,830 --> 02:03:38,420
你终於学会狠下心来了？
Have you finally learned to do what is necessary?

1317
02:03:38,630 --> 02:03:41,020
我不会杀你
I won't kill you...

1318
02:03:45,370 --> 02:03:47,620
但是我也不必救你
...but I don't have to save you.

1319
02:05:02,650 --> 02:05:05,840
- 会议已经开始了 - 什么会议？
The meeting's already started. - What meeting?

1320
02:05:09,990 --> 02:05:13,010
福克斯，我炒了你鱿鱼
Fox, I seem to remember firing you.

1321
02:05:13,430 --> 02:05:15,050
没错
You did.

1322
02:05:15,160 --> 02:05:17,340
我找到新工作
I got another job.

1323
02:05:18,090 --> 02:05:19,590
你的工作
Yours.

1324
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,760
谁有这个权力？
On whose authority?

1325
02:05:22,330 --> 02:05:24,350
蝙蝠侠上了头版新闻
Batman may have made the front page...

1326
02:05:24,470 --> 02:05:27,490
布鲁斯韦恩只上了第八版
...but Bruce Wayne got pushed to page eight.

1327
02:05:29,900 --> 02:05:33,720
(酒醉亿万富翁烧毁豪宅)


1328
02:05:34,240 --> 02:05:35,270
我是布鲁斯韦恩
Bruce Wayne.

1329
02:05:35,410 --> 02:05:39,330
你凭什么决定谁来掌管公司？
What makes you think you can decide who's running Wayne Enterprises?

1330
02:05:39,340 --> 02:05:42,190
- 因为我是公司老板 - 你在说什么？
- The fact that I'm the owner. EARLE: What are you talking about?

1331
02:05:42,340 --> 02:05:44,320
公司一星期前上市
The company went public a week ago.

1332
02:05:44,410 --> 02:05:45,940
我透过各种基金…
And I bought most of the shares.

1333
02:05:46,250 --> 02:05:49,850
买下大半股权
Through various charitable foundations and trusts and so forth.

1334
02:05:49,880 --> 02:05:53,220
你不会懂的，重点是…
Look, it's all a bit technical, but the important thing...

1335
02:05:53,320 --> 02:05:56,760
我的公司的未来很稳定
... is that my company's future is secure.

1336
02:05:56,990 --> 02:05:58,450
对吧，福克斯先生？
Right, Mr. Fox?

1337
02:05:58,560 --> 02:06:00,460
一点也没错
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.

1338
02:06:02,590 --> 02:06:04,250
你没收到通知吗？
Didn't you get the memo?

1339
02:06:23,110 --> 02:06:26,440
- 很抱歉我没告诉你 - 不必道歉
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Rachel. - No. No, Bruce...

1340
02:06:26,510 --> 02:06:27,930
不，我才要道歉
...I'm sorry.

1341
02:06:28,740 --> 02:06:31,520
齐利被枪杀那天
The day that Chill died, I...

1342
02:06:33,280 --> 02:06:34,970
我对你说了重话
I said terrible things.

1343
02:06:35,410 --> 02:06:37,250
那也是真话
But true things.

1344
02:06:37,810 --> 02:06:39,720
我当时是个懦夫
I was a coward with a gun...

1345
02:06:39,820 --> 02:06:43,740
正义不代表报仇，我要谢谢你
...and justice is about more than revenge, so thank you.

1346
02:06:44,650 --> 02:06:47,430
我一直在想着你
I never stopped thinking about you.

1347
02:06:48,790 --> 02:06:50,480
还有我们
About us.

1348
02:06:51,060 --> 02:06:53,110
我听说你回来
And when I heard you were back, I...

1349
02:06:53,860 --> 02:06:56,150
我就抱着希望
I started to hope.

1350
02:07:20,110 --> 02:07:22,920
但是后来我发现你的面具
But then I found out about your mask.

1351
02:07:24,010 --> 02:07:26,930
蝙蝠侠只是我的化身
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.

1352
02:07:27,450 --> 02:07:29,180
不
No. This...

1353
02:07:30,280 --> 02:07:32,050
这是你的面具
...is your mask.

1354
02:07:33,950 --> 02:07:37,660
现在的你是犯罪克星
Your real face is the one that criminals now fear.

1355
02:07:38,360 --> 02:07:40,410
我深爱的人
The man I loved...

1356
02:07:41,060 --> 02:07:42,550
曾经离开我的人
...the man who vanished...

1357
02:07:43,730 --> 02:07:45,940
他根本就没有回来
...he never came back at all.

1358
02:07:50,360 --> 02:07:53,100
他还在世界某个角落
But maybe he's still out there somewhere.

1359
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:59,020
有一天高谭市不再需要蝙蝠侠
Maybe someday, when Gotham no longer needs Batman...

1360
02:07:59,940 --> 02:08:01,990
也许我会再见到他
...I'll see him again.

1361
02:08:12,950 --> 02:08:15,970
- 你证明我错了 - 什么事？
- Proved me wrong, you know. - About what?

1362
02:08:18,680 --> 02:08:21,250
你父亲会以你为荣
Your father would be very proud of you.

1363
02:08:21,390 --> 02:08:23,040
就像我一样
Just like me.

1364
02:08:49,970 --> 02:08:51,910
你接下来有什么打算？
What will you do?

1365
02:08:53,240 --> 02:08:54,860
重新开始
Rebuild it.

1366
02:08:55,680 --> 02:08:58,140
一砖一瓦重建家园
Just the way it was, brick for brick.

1367
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:06,200
就跟以前一样吗？
Just the way it was, sir?

1368
02:09:08,250 --> 02:09:09,530
是啊，怎么样？
Yeah, why?

1369
02:09:09,650 --> 02:09:12,600
我觉得可以
I thought this might be a good opportunity for...

1370
02:09:12,650 --> 02:09:15,230
加强地基的部分
...improving the foundations.

1371
02:09:15,290 --> 02:09:18,380
- 东南角的地基吗？ - 没错
- In the southeast corner? - Precisely, sir.

1372
02:09:33,930 --> 02:09:36,890
- 挺好的 - 我找不到黑帮老大绑在上面
- Nice. - I couldn't find any mob bosses.

1373
02:09:37,700 --> 02:09:40,550
- 警官 - 我现在是队长了
Well, sergeant? - It's "lieutenant" now.

1374
02:09:40,770 --> 02:09:42,330
你改变了现状
You really started something.

1375
02:09:42,470 --> 02:09:44,520
坏警察不敢再乱来
Bent cops running scared.

1376
02:09:44,610 --> 02:09:46,100
人们也充满希望
Hope on the streets.

1377
02:09:46,280 --> 02:09:50,020
- 但是呢？ - 奈何岛仍然被罪犯控制
- But? - The Narrows is lost.

1378
02:09:50,410 --> 02:09:54,440
克莱恩和变态恶徒也没落网
And we still haven't picked up Crane or half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.

1379
02:09:54,920 --> 02:09:56,610
我们会抓到他们的
We will.

1380
02:09:56,780 --> 02:09:58,510
我们可以拯救高谭市
We can bring Gotham back.

1381
02:09:58,620 --> 02:10:01,210
- 道高一尺、魔高一丈？ - 怎么说？
- What about escalation? - Escalation?

1382
02:10:01,290 --> 02:10:05,750
警察开始用半自动步枪 歹徒就买自动步枪
We start carrying semiautomatics, they buy automatics.

1383
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:10,290
我们穿防弹衣，他们用达姆弹
We start wearing Kevlar, they buy armor-piercing rounds.

1384
02:10:10,290 --> 02:10:13,690
- 然后呢？ - 你戴着面具
- And? - And you're wearing a mask...

1385
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,010
飞檐走壁
...and jumping off rooftops.

1386
02:10:17,300 --> 02:10:19,410
就拿这家伙来说
Now, take this guy.

1387
02:10:19,570 --> 02:10:21,710
杀人放火、无恶不作
Armed robbery, double homicide.

1388
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:25,170
他跟你一样爱玩变装秀
Got a taste for the theatrical, like you.

1389
02:10:25,300 --> 02:10:27,320
犯案后都留下名片
Leaves a calling card.

1390
02:10:29,910 --> 02:10:31,920
(小丑)


1391
02:10:33,110 --> 02:10:35,020
我会查查他的底细
I'll look into it.

1392
02:10:38,410 --> 02:10:40,000
我一直没谢谢你
I never said thank you.

1393
02:10:44,980 --> 02:10:47,130
你也永远不用谢我
And you'll never have to.
