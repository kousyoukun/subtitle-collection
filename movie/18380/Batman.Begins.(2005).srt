这是你父亲的吗？
Is this your father's?

00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,746

好消息
Good news.

我们抓住他了，孩子
We got him, son.

163
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,788
你就放心吧
You're in excellent hands.

164
00:15:18,788 --> 00:15:20,509
我们会帮你经管好企业的
We'll be watching the empire.

00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:23,549
等你长大了 我们会把它好好交到你手里
When you grow up, it'll be waiting for you.

166
00:15:38,911 --> 00:15:41,903
我想应该准备些晚饭了
I thought I might prepare a little supper.

167
00:15:46,871 --> 00:15:48,862
-好吧 -艾尔弗雷德
- Very well. - Alfred?

168
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:54,582
-什么事，少爷？ -都怪我，艾尔弗雷德
- Yes, Master Bruce? - It was my fault, Alfred.

169
00:15:54,582 --> 00:15:56,343
-是我让他们提前离开歌剧院的 -不...
- I made them leave the theater. - No.

170
00:15:56,343 --> 00:15:59,423
-我要是不害怕的话... -这事跟你没关系
- lf I hadn't gotten scared... - It was nothing that you did.

171
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,708
全都是那凶手的错 都是他
It was him, and him alone.

172
00:16:04,191 --> 00:16:05,624
你明白吗？
Do you understand?

173
00:16:08,631 --> 00:16:11,543
我想他们，艾尔弗雷德 我真的想他们
I miss them, Alfred. I miss them so much.

174
00:16:11,543 --> 00:16:13,622
我也一样，布鲁斯少爷
So do I, Master Bruce.

00:16:15,951 --> 00:16:17,145
我也一样
So do I.

176
00:16:19,191 --> 00:16:22,069
杜卡德:你还为你父母的死感到自责吗？
DUCARD: And do you still feel responsible for your parents' death?

177
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:24,222
我的愤怒超过了我的自责
My anger outweighs my guilt.

178
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,270
来吧
Come.

179
00:16:30,751 --> 00:16:33,345
你已经学会了用愤怒淹没自责
You have learned to bury your guilt with anger.

180
00:16:33,345 --> 00:16:36,424
我来教你如何正确面对现实
I will teach you to confront it and to face the truth.

181
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:43,587
你知道如何战胜六个对手 我们可以教会你如何打败六百个敌人
You know how to fight six men. We can teach you how to engage 600.

182
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:46,589
你懂得如何潜伏
You know how to disappear.

183
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,868
我们可以教你如何隐身
We can teach you to become truly invisible.

184
00:16:50,432 --> 00:16:52,070
隐身？
Invisible?

[啊...]
[GRUNTING]

188

任何时候都要保持警惕
Always mind your surroundings.

189
00:17:17,472 --> 00:17:19,588
忍者讲究实用小型炸弹
Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.

190
00:17:21,032 --> 00:17:23,182
-当作武器？ -或者当作烟雾弹
- As weapons? - Or distractions.

191
00:17:23,182 --> 00:17:25,582
戏剧性的骗术是很有效的手段
Theatricality and deception are powerful agents.

192
00:17:26,032 --> 00:17:28,944
你必须超越你的对手对你的设想
You must become more than just a man in the mind of your opponent.

[我是冤枉的]
[MAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

194
00:17:31,145 --> 00:17:33,189
布鲁斯:他是谁？ -他是一个农夫
BRUCE: Who is he? - He was a farmer.

195
00:17:33,189 --> 00:17:36,469
为了霸占邻居的土地 他变成了一个凶手
Then he tried to take his neighbor's land and became a murderer.

196
00:17:36,469 --> 00:17:38,827
-现在被监禁了 -打算怎么处置他？
- Now he is a prisoner. - What'll happen to him?

197
00:17:38,827 --> 00:17:41,301
正义，邪恶不能被宽恕
Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated.

198
00:17:41,301 --> 00:17:45,260
要知道罪犯的所作所为 是对社会同情心的侮辱
Criminals thrive on the indulgence of society's understanding.

199
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:51,871
你父母的死并不是你的错
Your parents' death was not your fault.

200
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:01,066
而是你父亲的错
It was your father's.

201
00:18:21,113 --> 00:18:23,832
你发火也没用 无法改变你父亲没有反抗的事实
Anger does not change the fact that your father failed to act.

202
00:18:23,832 --> 00:18:26,109
-那个人手里有枪 -枪能阻止你反抗吗？
- The man had a gun. - Would that stop you?

203

这跟训练毫无关系
The training is nothing!

主观决定一切
Will is everything!

付出行动的意愿
The will to act.

投降吧
Yield.

你并没有打败我
You haven't beaten me.

00:18:51,226 --> 00:18:53,987
你在袭击我之前 脚下已经失控了

你比你父亲要强壮
You are stronger than your father.

你并不认识我父亲
You didn't know my father.

214
00:19:12,591 --> 00:19:14,948
但是我了解你内心的愤怒
But I know the rage that drives you.

215
00:19:14,948 --> 00:19:17,308
这种无法抑制的愤怒 在你的内心郁结纠缠
That impossible anger strangling the grief...

...转化为你血液中的毒素
...poison in your veins.

And one day, you catch yourself wishing the person you loved had never existed...

...只有这样你才可以化解你的痛楚
...so you'd be spared your pain.

我并没有一直住在山里
I wasn't always here in the mountains.

221

She was taken from me.

像你一样 我必须毫无选择地 面对这种残酷的事实...
Like you, I was forced to learn there are those without decency...

225

...必须学会无情的反击
...who must be fought without hesitation, without pity.

你的愤怒会带给你巨大的力量
Your anger gives you great power.

227
00:19:56,834 --> 00:20:00,224
但是如果你不加以控制，他会毁掉你...
But if you let it, it will destroy you...

228
00:20:00,754 --> 00:20:01,948
...我差一点就被毁掉
...as it almost did me.

229
00:20:02,594 --> 00:20:05,427
-怎么阻止他？ -复仇
- What stopped it? - Vengeance.

230
00:20:05,634 --> 00:20:07,386
这点对我无效
That's no help to me.

为什么 布鲁斯？
Why, Bruce?

232
00:20:09,306 --> 00:20:12,034
你为什么不能为你的父母复仇?
Why could you not avenge your parents?

233
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,024
参加了听证会以后  您马上会普林斯顿去吗？
Will you be heading back to Princeton after the hearing, sir...

234
00:20:19,024 --> 00:20:21,754
...或许我能说服您在这儿多住几天
...or can I persuade you to stay on for a day or two?

235
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:24,030
布鲁斯:我不会回去了
BRUCE: I'm not heading back at all.

艾尔弗雷德:你不喜欢那里？ -我很喜欢
ALFRED: You don't like it there? - I like it fine.

237
00:20:26,554 --> 00:20:29,227
只是和以前的感觉不太一样
They just don't feel the same way.

238
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:33,509
-我已经把老爷的卧室给您收拾好了 -不必了
- I've prepared the master bedroom. - No.

239
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:35,027
我自己的房间就很好
My room will be fine.

240
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:37,833
艾尔弗雷德:恕我直言韦恩庄园属于您
ALFRED: With all due respect, sir, Wayne Manor is your house.

241
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,746
布鲁斯:不 艾尔弗雷德 它属于我父亲的
BRUCE: No, Alfred, it's my father's house.

242
00:20:39,746 --> 00:20:41,984
-你父亲不在了 -这里是一座坟墓
- Your father is dead. - This place is a mausoleum.

243
00:20:41,984 --> 00:20:45,066
如果依着我 我恨不能把这房子拆了
If I have my way, I'll pull the damn thing down brick by brick.

244
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:49,147
这栋房子，韦恩大人 荫庇了您的家族六代人了
This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered six generations of your family.

245
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,908
又不是你的家人，艾尔弗雷德 你干嘛那么在乎啊？
Why do you give a damn, Alfred? It's not your family.

246
00:20:52,714 --> 00:20:56,423
我之所以在乎， 那是因为有一位好人他托付我
I give a damn because a good man once made me responsible...

247
00:20:57,074 --> 00:20:59,144
...让我照顾他一生中...
...for what was most precious to him...

248
00:20:59,144 --> 00:21:01,464
...最珍爱的一个人
...in the whole world.

249
00:21:03,354 --> 00:21:06,744
道斯小姐打算开车送您去听证会
Miss Dawes has offered to drive you to the hearing.

250
00:21:06,744 --> 00:21:08,870
他也许私下里有话要对你说
She probably hopes to talk you out of going.

251
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:12,344
布鲁斯:我难道要把我过去的一切 也和我的父母一同埋葬嘛？艾尔弗雷德
BRUCE: Should I just bury the past out there with my parents, Alfred?

252
00:21:12,344 --> 00:21:15,472
我无法告诉你应该如何对待你的过去
I wouldn't presume to tell you what to do with your past, sir.

253
00:21:15,472 --> 00:21:19,513
但是我们这些人都很关系 你如何对待您的未来
Just know that there are those of us who care about what you do with your future.

254
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:22,267
你还没有放弃我吗？
Haven't given up on me yet?

255
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,347
永远不会
Never.

256
00:22:10,915 --> 00:22:14,749
艾尔弗雷德还把炼乳放在架子的顶层？
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk on the top shelf.

257
00:22:14,955 --> 00:22:16,832
难道他没有注意到你已经长高了吗？
Hasn't he noticed you're tall enough to reach now?

258
00:22:17,155 --> 00:22:18,634
我看是旧习难改了
Old habits die hard, I guess.

259
00:22:18,634 --> 00:22:21,104
-不过这个方法从来没有阻止过咱们 -就是的
- Never used to stop us anyway. - No, it didn't.

260
00:22:21,104 --> 00:22:23,072
你妈妈怎么样？
How's your mom?

261
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,625
她很怀念这里
She misses this place.

262
00:22:27,075 --> 00:22:28,508
我也是
So do I.

263
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:30,109
是呀
Yeah.

264
00:22:30,109 --> 00:22:33,153
不过已经物是人非了
But it's nothing without the people who made it what it was.

265
00:22:33,153 --> 00:22:36,193
-现在这里就剩艾尔弗雷德 -还有你
- Now there's only Alfred. - And you.

266
00:22:36,193 --> 00:22:39,745
-我不会留下来的，雷切尔 -你是来参加听证会的
- I'm not staying, Rachel. - You're just back for the hearing.

267
00:22:43,235 --> 00:22:47,228
布鲁斯 我知道 谁也无法阻止你回来 我知道
Bruce, I don't suppose there's any way to convince you not to come.

268
00:22:47,555 --> 00:22:50,911
听证会上必须...
Someone at this proceeding...

269
00:22:51,555 --> 00:22:53,625
...有人代表我的父母
...should stand for my parents.

我们都很爱你的父母 布鲁斯
We all loved your parents, Bruce.

00:22:55,831 --> 00:22:59,067
-切尔的所作所为是不可饶恕的 -那为什么你的上司要放走他
- What Chill did is unforgivable. - Then why is your boss letting him go?

272
00:23:00,395 --> 00:23:03,512
在监狱里他和法尔科内 共用一部手机
In prison, he shared a cell with Carmine Falcone.

273
00:23:03,512 --> 00:23:07,190
他听到了一些秘密 他想用此作为交换 提前出狱
He learned things, and he will testify in exchange for early parole.

274
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,915
雷切尔，这个人杀了我的双亲
Rachel, this man killed my parents.

275
00:23:11,835 --> 00:23:13,474
我是永远无法忘记这一切的
I cannot let that pass.

276
00:23:13,474 --> 00:23:16,389
我需要你的理解 雷切尔
And I need you to understand that, please.

277
00:23:18,076 --> 00:23:19,225
好吧
Okay.

278
00:23:20,276 --> 00:23:23,473
芬奇:经济大萧条对切尔先生 这样的工人打击最大
FINCH: The depression hit working people, like Mr. Chill, hardest of all.

279
00:23:23,473 --> 00:23:26,708
他的罪行虽然骇人听闻 但是其犯罪的动机并非出于贪婪...
His crime was appalling, yes, but it was motivated not by greed...

280
00:23:27,036 --> 00:23:28,628
...而是出于绝望
...but by desperation.

281
00:23:28,628 --> 00:23:32,550
同时鉴于他已经在狱中服刑了十四年...
Given the 14 years served, as well as his extraordinary level of cooperation...

282
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,230
...加之这次他对地区检察官的通力配合...
...with one of this office's most important investigations...

283
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:38,388
...我们完全赞同提前解除他的刑期
...we strongly endorse his petition for early release.

284
00:23:39,356 --> 00:23:41,551
法顿:切尔先生
FADEN: Mr. Chill?

285
00:23:44,996 --> 00:23:46,588
切尔: 尊敬的大人...
CHILL: Your Honor...

286
00:23:47,436 --> 00:23:50,428
...没有一天我不是生活在悔恨当中
...not a day goes by that I don't wish I could take back what I did.

287
00:23:52,956 --> 00:23:56,073
是的 我是很绝望 像那时的许多人一样...
Sure, I was desperate, like a lot of people back then...

288
00:23:56,073 --> 00:23:58,466
...但是这并不能改变我所作的一切
...but that don't change what I did.

289
00:24:01,956 --> 00:24:06,427
法顿:我想今天有一位 韦恩家族的成员也在场
FADEN: I gather there is a member of the Wayne family here today.

290
00:24:06,427 --> 00:24:08,791
他有话要说吗？
Has he got anything to say?

RACHEL: Come on, Bruce.

299
00:24:53,437 --> 00:24:54,995
我们别看了
We don't need to see this.

300
00:24:55,717 --> 00:24:57,196
可我想看
I do.

301
00:25:02,117 --> 00:25:04,426
雷切尔:地方检察官不可能明白
RACHEL: The DA couldn't understand why Judge Faden insisted...

302
00:25:04,426 --> 00:25:05,996
...法官为什么要举行公开听证会
...on making the hearing public.

303
00:25:05,996 --> 00:25:08,432
其实是法尔科内收买了他 使切尔暴露在公共场合
Falcone paid him off to get Chill out in the open.

304
00:25:08,637 --> 00:25:09,831
也许我们还应该感谢他们呢
Maybe I should thank them.

305
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:12,465
-我不相信你真的这么想 -我要是真的这么想呢 雷切尔？
- You don't mean that. - What if I do, Rachel?

306
00:25:12,465 --> 00:25:14,468
我父母应该得到公正
My parents deserved justice.

307
00:25:14,468 --> 00:25:17,435
其实你在谈论的 不是公正 而是报仇
You're not talking about justice. You're talking about revenge.

308
00:25:17,435 --> 00:25:20,350
-有时他们就是一回事 -不 它根本就不是一回事
- Sometimes, they're the same. - No, they're never the same.

309
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:23,953
公正是为了平息矛盾 而报仇是为了平息自己的愤怒
Justice is about harmony. Revenge is about you making yourself feel better.

310
00:25:23,953 --> 00:25:27,268
-这就是为什么我们要建立公正的制度 -遗憾的是你的制度已经失效了
- It's why we have an impartial system. - Your system is broken.

你真的在乎公正吗？ 还是只在乎你自己的痛苦？
You care about justice? Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.

313
00:25:37,197 --> 00:25:38,596
这个城市已经腐朽堕落了
This city is rotting.

314
00:25:38,596 --> 00:25:41,430
他们说起经济大萧条 好像已经是过去的历史
They talk about the depression as if it's history. It's not.

315
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,030
其实并非如此，这的一切比以往更糟
Things are worse than ever here.

316
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:45,631
法尔科内用罪恶和毒品 摧毁了我们的城市...
Falcone floods our streets with crime and drugs...

317
00:25:45,631 --> 00:25:48,630
...每天都在制造乔.切尔 这样的亡命徒 你知道吗？
...preying on the desperate, creating new Joe Chills every day.

318
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,231
也许法尔科内并没有 亲手杀死你的父母...
Falcone may not have killed your parents, Bruce...

319
00:25:51,837 --> 00:25:54,226
... 但他们摧毁了赖以生存的基础
...but he's destroying everything that they stood for.

320
00:25:58,597 --> 00:26:01,350
你要是感谢他们就在这
You wanna thank him for that? Here you go.

321
00:26:03,157 --> 00:26:06,069
大家都知道能在哪里找到这些为富不仁之人...
We all know where to find him. As long as he keeps the bad people rich...

322
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:08,273
...大家都近鬼神而远之
...and the good people scared, no one'll touch him.

323
00:26:08,273 --> 00:26:12,510
像你父母一样站起来维护 正义的好人都没有了
Good people like your parents, who'll stand against injustice, they're gone.

324
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:16,226
当所有的好人都选择沉默的时候？ 这个城市还有什么希望...
What chance does Gotham have when the good people do nothing?

325
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:20,353
-我并不是你所谓的好人 雷切尔 -你是什么意思？
- I'm not one of your good people, Rachel. - What do you mean?

326
00:26:22,517 --> 00:26:25,429
这么多年以来 我一直想杀死他
All these years, I wanted to kill him.

327
00:26:26,197 --> 00:26:27,710
而现在却不同了
Now I can't.

328
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:44,596
你父亲会为你感到耻辱的
Your father would be ashamed of you.

329
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,667
你比报纸上看得高，韦恩先生
You're taller than you look in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.

330
00:27:29,118 --> 00:27:30,915
没带枪？真是对我的侮辱
No gun? I'm insulted.

331
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:37,587
-你托人带一封感谢信就行了 -我不是来表示感谢的
- You could've just sent a thank-you note. - I didn't come here to thank you.

332
00:27:37,587 --> 00:27:40,397
我要让你知道 并不是所有哥特人都惧怕你
I came to show you that not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you.

333
00:27:40,397 --> 00:27:42,116
只有认识我的人才怕我，孩子
Only those who know me, kid.

334
00:27:42,438 --> 00:27:44,827
你看看吧 这儿有两位市议院的官员...
Look around you. You'll see two councilmen...

335
00:27:45,158 --> 00:27:47,877
...一位众议院官员 几位警官...
...a union official, couple off-duty cops...

336
00:27:48,278 --> 00:27:49,836
...还有一位法官
...and a judge.

337
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:54,116
现在我可以毫不犹豫地 把你的脑袋轰掉
I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of blowing your head off in front of them.

338
00:27:54,116 --> 00:27:56,872
就当着他们的面，这就是你无法企及的能量
Now, that's power you can't buy.

339
00:27:57,478 --> 00:27:58,877
这就是你恐惧的来源
That's the power of fear.

340
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:00,472
我并不惧怕你
I'm not afraid of you.

341
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:02,469
那是因为你以为自己 没有什么怕失去的
Because you think you got nothing to lose.

342
00:28:02,469 --> 00:28:04,230
可惜你想得不仔细
But you haven't thought it through.

343
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:07,356
你没有考虑到 你那在市检察院工作的女友
You haven't thought about your lady friend in the DA's office.

344
00:28:07,356 --> 00:28:10,430
还有你的老管家 嘣
You haven't thought about your old butler. Bang!

345
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:16,029
来自你们那个世界的人...
People from your world...

346
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:18,474
...有太多害怕失去的东西
...have so much to lose.

347
00:28:18,474 --> 00:28:22,791
你以为 一位你的妈妈爸爸被杀了...
Now, you think because your mommy and your daddy got shot...

348
00:28:22,791 --> 00:28:25,792
...你就了解人生的残酷 其实你还差得远
...you know about the ugly side of life, but you don't.

349
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:27,995
你还不知道什么叫做绝望
You've never tasted desperate.

350
00:28:27,995 --> 00:28:30,593
你是布鲁斯.韦恩 哥特城的王子
You're... You're Bruce Wayne, the prince of Gotham.

351
00:28:30,593 --> 00:28:34,035
千里之外你才体会得到 无人知晓的滋味
You'd have to go 1000 miles to meet someone who didn't know your name.

352
00:28:34,035 --> 00:28:38,317
所以你不要带着你的愤怒到这里来 以此证实你的能力
So don't come here with your anger, trying to prove something to yourself.

353
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:40,515
这个世界你永远无法了解
This is a world you'll never understand.

354
00:28:40,515 --> 00:28:42,590
因为你无法了解...
And you always fear...

355
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:45,114
...所以你才会恐惧
...what you don't understand.

356
00:28:47,879 --> 00:28:49,198
就这样
All right.

357
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:59,238
好，我得这么说 你有种，小子
Yeah, you got spirit, kid. I'll give you that.

比你老子有种
More than your old man anyway.

359
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:05,597
在牢里 切尔告诉我说 那天晚上他去杀你父母的时候
In the joint, Chill told me about the night he killed your parents.

360
00:29:05,597 --> 00:29:07,875
你父亲乞求他饶命
He said your father begged for mercy.

361
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:10,871
乞求

...and conquer your fears.

但是罪犯并不可怕
But a criminal is not complicated.

真正可怕的是你的内心
And what you really fear is inside yourself.

你惧怕你内心的能量
You fear your own power.

惧怕你的愤怒...
You fear your anger...

...它会驱使你做出 或伟大或可怕的事情

若想战胜恐惧 你必须化身为恐惧
To conquer fear, you must become fear.

398
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:54,432
在他人的恐惧中体会到乐趣
You must bask in the fear of other men.

I can't do that as Bruce Wayne.

我还没想清楚...怎么样恢复你这个在 法律上已经死亡者的身份
I couldn't figure the legal ramifications of bringing you back from the dead.

He wanted to liquidate your majority shareholding.

那可是一大笔钱呢
Those shares are worth quite a bit of money.

幸亏当时我把一切都留给了你

And you can borrow the Rolls, if you like. Just bring it back with a full tank.

In my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much a danger to himself as to others...

494
00:41:35,167 --> 00:41:39,558

你真的认为像他这样凶残的杀手 不应该被送进监狱吗？
You think a man who butchers people for the mob doesn't belong in jail?

497
00:41:47,558 --> 00:41:50,287
我可不会这么说 你说呢 道斯小姐？
I would hardly have testified to that otherwise, would I?

This is the third of Falcone's thugs you've had declared insane...

...而转入你的精神病院的
...and moved into your asylum.

500

531
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,487
我们也有对付这种人的办法
Well, there's an answer to that too.

532
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:49,682
-我不想知道 -你应该知道
- I don't want to know. - Yes, you do.

533
00:45:53,689 --> 00:45:56,999
不 我们这几个部门的增长 十分良好
MAN: No, we are showing very healthy growth in these sectors.

534
00:45:56,999 --> 00:46:00,206
我认为托马斯.韦恩不会同意将武器生产...
I don't think Thomas Wayne would have viewed heavy-arms manufacture...

535
00:46:00,206 --> 00:46:02,439
...作为企业基础产业的
...as a suitable cornerstone for our business.

536
00:46:03,769 --> 00:46:07,398
不错，那是二十年前的事了 费德里克
Well, that's 20 years ago, Fredericks.

537
00:46:07,729 --> 00:46:10,766
我认为二十年后的今天 我们应该允许...
I think after 20 years we can allow ourselves...

538
00:46:10,766 --> 00:46:13,648
...不再以托马斯.韦恩的意愿为转移了吧
...to stop thinking about what Thomas Wayne would have done.

539
00:46:13,648 --> 00:46:15,606
杰西卡:早上好 厄尔先生办公室

布鲁斯.韦恩

544
00:46:27,729 --> 00:46:31,086
托马斯很可能也不同意 公司的股份上市
Thomas would probably not have taken the company public.

545
00:46:31,086 --> 00:46:35,163
但是这却是我们这些 责任经营者打算做的事情
But that is what we, as responsible managers, are going to do.

546

BRUCE: Eye on the ball, and... - Why is no one answering the phone?

It's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle. I'm sure they'll call back.

550
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:51,439
布鲁斯？你不是死了吗？

00:46:51,439 --> 00:46:53,487
对不起让你失望来了

It's been all over the news. He's back.

555
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:06,888
厄尔:我已经无法阻止 这个庞大的机器了
EARLE: I'm sure you realize I can't stop the big machine.

556
00:47:06,888 --> 00:47:08,199
太多的环节

557
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:10,321
-我们的股份就要上市了 -我明白

而且我会得到丰厚的回报的

559
00:47:13,489 --> 00:47:16,084
我来并不想干涉什么
I'm not looking to interfere.

560
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:18,566
-我只是来找工作 -哦？

我只想了解一下 我家族的企业的情况

你打算从哪儿开始呢？
Any ideas where you would start?

563
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:26,405

我到时候通知他

566
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:34,009
你长得很像他―― 你的――父亲

567
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:37,330
你是韦恩家族唯一的一员了

00:47:49,004 --> 00:47:51,730
-没有进入生产环节 -一个都没有？
- On any level whatsoever. - None?

572
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:54,442
他们怎么向你介绍的？
What did they tell you this place was?

573
00:47:54,442 --> 00:47:56,566
布鲁斯:他们什么都没跟我说
BRUCE: They didn't tell me anything.

574
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:02,240
厄尔当初派我来的时候 可是一字不差地这么跟我说的
Earle told me exactly what it was when he sent me down here.

575
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:04,089

把韦恩大厦变成了 哥特城的民间中心
Kind of made Wayne Tower the unofficial center of Gotham City.

588
00:48:41,323 --> 00:48:44,051
当然，厄尔后来毁了它
Of course, Earle let it go to rot. Here we are.

...a soldier's life was worth 300 grand.

那么，你为什么对这些感兴趣呢？ 韦恩先生
So, what's your interest in it, Mr. Wayne?

596
00:49:05,971 --> 00:49:07,404

我想他们没试过把它推销给喜欢 钻山洞和低空跳跃的亿万富翁
I don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, BASE-jumping crowd.

663
00:54:22,725 --> 00:54:24,612
-听着 福克斯先生 -是的 先生
- Look, Mr. Fox. - Yes, sir?

664
00:54:25,254 --> 00:54:26,573
要是你不愿意的话--
If you're uncomfortable...

...waiting for anybody willing to do anything about it.

有的时候-- 有的时候事情还会更严重一些
Sometimes... Sometimes things just go bad.

695
00:56:19,735 --> 00:56:21,453
这与石墨的含量有关
It's a problem with the graphite, sir.

696

01:05:56,381 --> 01:05:57,780
真是好车
Nice car.

797
01:05:57,780 --> 01:05:59,260
你应该见识见识我另一辆车
You should see my other one.

798
01:06:08,661 --> 01:06:10,731
他干了警察干不了的事
WOMAN: He's done something the police never have.

799
01:06:10,731 --> 01:06:13,096
可也不改擅自执法
MAN: You can't take the law into your own hands.

800
01:06:13,096 --> 01:06:15,729
话虽这么说 但至少 他干了些他该干的事
Well, at least he's getting something done.

801
01:06:15,729 --> 01:06:18,131
-布鲁斯 快帮我说句话吧 -嗯？
MAN: Bruce, help me out here. - Huh?

802
01:06:18,131 --> 01:06:22,453
哦 我认为 要是一个人 打扮成蝙蝠的模样
Well, a guy who dresses up like a bat clearly has issues.

803
01:06:23,461 --> 01:06:25,612
肯定脑子有问题
But he's put Falcone behind bars.

804
01:06:25,612 --> 01:06:28,057
可他到底把法尔科内关进了监狱 可现在警察却要抓蝙蝠侠 这你怎么看
MAN: Now the cops want him. What does that tell you?

805
01:06:28,057 --> 01:06:29,371
这是他们妒忌他
They're jealous.

806
01:06:29,371 --> 01:06:32,056
先生 喷水池只是用来装饰的...
Sir, the pool is for decoration...

807
01:06:32,056 --> 01:06:35,453
...而且您的朋友没穿泳衣
...and your friends do not have swimwear.

808
01:06:37,182 --> 01:06:39,093
哦 他们是欧洲人 比较开放
Well, they're European.

809
01:06:40,862 --> 01:06:43,137
我不得不要求您离开
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

810
01:06:44,022 --> 01:06:47,332
-这不是钱的问题 -不过 嗯...
- It is not a question of money. - Well, you see...

811
01:06:47,902 --> 01:06:49,620
...我正在买下这个饭店...
...I'm buying this hotel...

812
01:06:51,342 --> 01:06:55,574
...而且我打算重新给 游泳区域定些新的规矩
...and setting some new rules about the pool area.

813
01:06:56,702 --> 01:06:58,977
我觉得应该给蝙蝠侠颁发勋章
I think the Batman deserves a medal.

814
01:06:58,977 --> 01:07:01,178
应该给他穿上紧身衣
And a straitjacket to pin it on.

815
01:07:07,422 --> 01:07:08,935
谢谢
MAN: Thank you.

816
01:07:10,622 --> 01:07:11,896
布鲁斯？
Bruce?

817
01:07:15,342 --> 01:07:17,060
雷切尔？
Rachel?

818
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:18,575
我听说你回来了
I'd heard you were back.

819
01:07:20,542 --> 01:07:21,975
你在干什么呢？
What are you doing?

820
01:07:22,702 --> 01:07:26,934
在这游泳 哦 很高兴再见面
Just swimming here. Wow, it is good to see you.

821
01:07:26,934 --> 01:07:28,581
你走了很长时间
You were gone a long time.

822
01:07:29,142 --> 01:07:31,940
-我知道 你怎么样？ -老样子
- I know. How are things? - The same.

823
01:07:33,782 --> 01:07:35,374
工作越来越不好做了
Job's getting worse.

824
01:07:35,374 --> 01:07:38,136
一个人的力量是无法改变世界的
Can't change the world on your own.

825
01:07:38,136 --> 01:07:40,293
我还能有有什么其它的选择...
What choice do I have...

826
01:07:40,942 --> 01:07:42,614
...连你都在忙着游泳
...when you're too busy swimming?

827
01:07:43,902 --> 01:07:45,858
雷切尔 这些--
Rachel, all of...

828
01:07:46,142 --> 01:07:47,734
所有这些....
All this...

829
01:07:49,102 --> 01:07:52,981
-- 都不是我 其实 我....
It's... It's not me. It's...

830
01:07:53,382 --> 01:07:55,896
内心 ...
Inside, I am...

831
01:07:57,062 --> 01:07:58,939
有苦衷
I am more.

832
01:07:59,582 --> 01:08:01,061
来 布鲁斯 快点
WOMAN 1: Come on, Bruce. Come on.

833
01:08:01,061 --> 01:08:04,852
布鲁斯 来 我们还要去买下更多的饭店
WOMAN 2: Bruce, we have some more hotels for you to buy.

834
01:08:05,863 --> 01:08:07,262
布鲁斯...
Bruce...

835
01:08:08,383 --> 01:08:11,739
...也许你仍然是那个出色的男孩
...deep down you may still be that same great kid you used to be.

836
01:08:14,063 --> 01:08:16,531
但是这不是你过去如何的问题...
But it's not who you are underneath...

837
01:08:16,983 --> 01:08:18,655
...重要的是你现在的表现
...it's what you do that defines you.

838
01:08:30,703 --> 01:08:32,216
谢谢你能来 克兰医生
WOMAN: Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.

839
01:08:32,216 --> 01:08:35,136
别客气 他割脉了？
Not at all. He cut his wrists?

840
01:08:35,136 --> 01:08:38,818
也许是为了保外就医 但一旦发生任何意外的话...
Probably looking for the insanity plea. But if anything should happen...

841
01:08:38,818 --> 01:08:41,816
那当然 安全第一
Of course, better safe than sorry.

842
01:08:45,103 --> 01:08:48,539
啊 克兰医生 我再也受不了了 太可怕了
Yeah, Dr. Crane, I can't take it anymore. It's all too much.

843
01:08:48,539 --> 01:08:51,058
四面的墙壁像我压呀 压呀 压过来
The walls are closing in. Blah, blah, blah.

844
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:53,972
吃了好几天这种伙食 我不疯才怪呢
A couple of days of this food, it'll be true.

845
01:08:54,943 --> 01:08:56,535
-你现在想怎么办？ -我现在想知道...
- What do you want? - I wanna know...

846
01:08:56,535 --> 01:08:59,092
...你到底打算怎样让我保持沉默
...how you're gonna convince me to keep my mouth shut.

847
01:08:59,092 --> 01:09:01,333
为什么事呢？ 你什么也不知道
About what? You don't know anything.

848
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:05,496
我知道你不想让警察过多地了解 他们起获的那些毒品
I know you don't want the cops to take a closer look at the drugs they seized.

849
01:09:05,496 --> 01:09:09,656
我还知道你在你的精神病院里 用病人作的那些药物试验
And I know about your experiments with the inmates of your nut house.

850
01:09:09,656 --> 01:09:13,338
你瞧 我从不跟 我不了解背景的人合作
See, I don't go into business with a guy without finding out his dirty secrets.

851
01:09:13,903 --> 01:09:16,701
还有你雇用的那些打手
And those goons you used.

852
01:09:16,701 --> 01:09:18,615
我掌握着这座城市所有的罪犯
I own the muscle in this town.

853
01:09:18,615 --> 01:09:22,014
目前 我已经帮你 走私药品好几个月了...
Now, I've been bringing your stuff in for months...

854
01:09:22,543 --> 01:09:26,582
...不管你的老板在计划什么 反正是桩大买卖 而我要加入
...so whatever he's planning, it's big, and I want in.

855
01:09:27,823 --> 01:09:30,815
那么 你就知道他要说什么啦
Well, I already know what he'll say.

856
01:09:31,223 --> 01:09:32,542
我们应该干掉你
That we should kill you.

857
01:09:34,343 --> 01:09:37,494
就是他也不能把我怎么样 至少在这不能
Even he can't get me in here. Not in my town.

858
01:09:43,223 --> 01:09:44,703
你想看看我的面罩吗？
Would you like to see my mask?

859
01:09:46,184 --> 01:09:47,583
我用来做药物试验的
I use it in my experiments.

860
01:09:49,984 --> 01:09:54,262
对你这样的人恐怕并不怎么可怕
Now, I'm probably not very frightening to a guy like you.

861
01:09:54,624 --> 01:09:57,343
不过我想对那些警察 他们受不了这种疯狂
But these crazies, they can't stand it.

862
01:09:58,104 --> 01:10:00,095
那么那些家伙是什么表现?
So when did the nut take over the nut house?

[叫喊声]

865
01:10:04,544 --> 01:10:06,102
...就像你现在这样
...much as you're doing now.

866
01:10:08,344 --> 01:10:11,416
看来 他并不是假装的
Well, he's not faking. Not that one.

867
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:14,018
我得去跟法官谈谈 看我是否可以把他...
I'll talk to the judge and see if I can get him moved...

868
01:10:14,018 --> 01:10:17,460
...带回阿克汉姆 在这里我无法给他治疗

蝙蝠侠:暴风雨就要来了
BATMAN: Storm's coming.

870
01:10:44,424 --> 01:10:47,302
你打败了法尔科内 把警长气疯啦
The scum is getting jumpy because you stood up to Falcone.

871
01:10:47,302 --> 01:10:50,854
这刚开个头 你的搭档当时也在码头
It's a start. Your partner was at the docks with Falcone.

872
01:10:50,854 --> 01:10:53,618
不错 他的第二职业 是充当个小打手
Well, he moonlights as a low-level enforcer.

873
01:10:53,984 --> 01:10:57,613
他们把货物分成两份 只有一半是给毒贩子的
They were splitting the shipment in two. Only half went to the dealers.

874
01:10:57,613 --> 01:10:59,615
为什么？那另一半呢？
Why? What about the other half?

875
01:11:00,064 --> 01:11:02,373
-福拉斯知道 -他不会说的
- Flass knows. - He won't talk.

876
01:11:02,984 --> 01:11:04,497
他会跟我说的
He'll talk to me.

877
01:11:04,497 --> 01:11:07,576
戈登: 雷波特派员 组织了大量的警力要抓捕你
GORDON: Commissioner Loeb set up a massive task force to catch you.

878
01:11:08,024 --> 01:11:10,458
-他认为你很危险 那你怎么认为呢？
- He thinks you're dangerous. - What do you think?

879
01:11:12,144 --> 01:11:14,453
我认为你再给我们提供帮助
I think you're trying to help.

880
01:11:19,264 --> 01:11:21,494

01:16:53,878 --> 01:16:57,553
我以前有过这种反应 不过这次更强烈
I've felt these effects before, but this was so much more potent.

928
01:16:57,553 --> 01:17:02,109
像是一种气雾致幻化学武器
It was some kind of hallucinogen, weaponized, in aerosol form.

929

你进错俱乐部了吧　韦恩先生
You have been hanging out in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.

930
01:17:05,111 --> 01:17:08,236
头一天情况不太好 所以我把福克斯先生叫来了
I called Mr. Fox when your condition worsened after the first day.

931
01:17:08,236 --> 01:17:09,717
福克斯:我给你做了血检...
FOX: I analyzed your blood...

...分离受体化合物 以及蛋白基催化物
...isolating the receptor compounds and the protein-based catalyst.

933
01:17:13,234 --> 01:17:15,116
我有必要懂这些专业术语吗？
Am I meant to understand any of that?

934
01:17:15,478 --> 01:17:18,515
不必要　我只想让你 明白这有多复杂
Not at all. I just wanted you to know how hard it was.

935
01:17:19,078 --> 01:17:22,627
-总之　我合成了一种解毒药 -你能在多做些吗？
- Bottom line, I synthesized an antidote. - Could you make more?

936
01:17:22,627 --> 01:17:25,266
你想再过过瘾吗？　韦恩先生　
You planning on gassing yourself again, Mr. Wayne?

937
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:28,510
我说　你知道怎么回事 晚上出去打架的时候...
Well, you know how it is. You're out at night, looking for kicks...

938
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:31,317
...说不定又被人用迷幻药下暗手...
...someone's passing around the weaponized hallucinogens...

939
01:17:31,317 --> 01:17:34,788
我把剩下的拿来 已经注射的解毒剂已经起效了
I'll bring what I have. The antidote should inoculate you for now.

940
01:17:34,788 --> 01:17:37,233

雷切尔:看来有人在连轴转哪
RACHEL: Looks like someone's been burning the candle at both ends.

I know. I'm sorry I can't come tonight. I was just dropping off your present.

948
01:17:59,993 --> 01:18:03,390
-晚上有更好的安排吗？ -我的上司失踪两天了...
- You've got better plans? - My boss has been missing for days...

949
01:18:03,390 --> 01:18:05,789

雷切尔.道斯
Rachel Dawes.

954
01:18:13,319 --> 01:18:16,789
谁给他这权力 把克兰马上带到办公室 不许他说不
Who authorized that? Get Crane down there now. Don't take no for an answer.

955
01:18:16,789 --> 01:18:20,668
给莱曼医生打电话 告诉他明天一早 把自己的评估报告放在法官的办公桌上
Call Dr. Lehmann, tell him we need our own assessment to the judge by morning.

956
01:18:21,079 --> 01:18:22,831
-出什么事了？ -是法尔科内.
- What's wrong? - It's Falcone.

957
01:18:22,831 --> 01:18:25,388
克兰医生把他带到 阿克汉姆精神病院去了
Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum on suicide watch.

958
01:18:25,388 --> 01:18:28,437
你现在要去阿克汉姆吗？ 那可是在窄岛上呀 雷切尔
You're going to Arkham now? It's in the Narrows, Rachel.

959
01:18:29,639 --> 01:18:31,391
你过你的生日吧 布鲁斯
You enjoy your party, Bruce.

01:18:31,391 --> 01:18:34,198
-我们可有工作要做了 -多加小心

但是 韦恩少爷 客人们马上就要到了
But, Master Wayne, the guests will be arriving.

963
01:18:58,035 --> 01:18:59,757
我回来之前 想办法让他们高兴
Keep them happy until I arrive.

964
01:18:59,757 --> 01:19:02,035
把你知道的笑话讲给他们听

厄尔:玩得挺高兴吗？
EARLE: Having fun?

01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,396
厄尔？你这个大人物 来这种地方干什么？
Bill? Now, what's a big shot like you doing in a place like this?

968
01:19:46,396 --> 01:19:47,788
我想知道些资料
I need some information.

It's a microwave emitter. It was designed to vaporize an enemy's water supply.

据说他们曾经用亲水化学介质作测试...
Rumor was they tested dispersing water-based chemicals into the air...

973
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:05,237
...可这样做是不是违法的？
...but isn't that illegal?

974

我需要所有这个研发项目的...

都说全了？
Did you lose one?

977
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:21,390
我把你的部门合并到档案部
I'm merging your department with Archives.

978
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:23,788
同时 我把你解雇了
And I am firing you.

979
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,751
你看见我给你的备忘录吗？
Didn't you get the memo?

01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:36,272
法尔科内:稻草人

道斯小姐 这很反常
Miss Dawes, this is most irregular.

984
01:20:50,716 --> 01:20:53,678
我对已经交给法官的报告 没有任何补充了
I have nothing to add to the report I filed with the judge.

985
01:20:53,678 --> 01:20:55,990
-我对你的报告有疑问 -举个例子

986
01:20:55,990 --> 01:21:00,278
对于一个52岁从无精神病史的男人来说...
Isn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man who has no history of mental illness...

987
01:21:00,278 --> 01:21:03,910
...在被起诉的时候突然之间精神崩溃 这也太不说得过去了吧
...to have a psychotic breakdown just when he's about to be indicted?

988
01:21:03,910 --> 01:21:08,153
是啊 正如你自己亲眼所见 他的症状实在是太说不过去了
As you can see for yourself, there is nothing convenient about his symptoms.

989
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,953
-稻草人. -什么"稻草人 "?.
- Scarecrow. - What's "scarecrow"?

990
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,870
病人通常会被某种幻觉所控制...
Patients suffering delusional episodes often focus their paranoia...

991
01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:20,076
...外在表现痛苦...

...通常会寄托一种原型
...usually one conforming to Jungian archetypes.

993
01:21:23,521 --> 01:21:25,830
而在他身上，就是稻草人
In this case, a scarecrow.

01:21:27,241 --> 01:21:31,200
-他服药了吗？ -精神病药理学是我的第一专业

在外边他是强人
Outside, he was a giant.

997
01:21:35,677 --> 01:21:38,196
在这里 只有意识才是强者
In here, only the mind can grant you power.

你更愿意颠倒过来

我更推崇意识超过生理
I respect the mind's power over the body.

01:21:43,079 --> 01:21:44,720
这也使我选择我的工作的原因
It's why I do what I do.

1001
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:49,591
我选择的工作就是把法尔科内 这样的恶棍关进监狱 而不是精神病院
I do what I do to keep thugs like Falcone behind bars, not in therapy.

1002
01:21:49,591 --> 01:21:52,912
我需要我们自己的精神病学医生 对法尔科内做更全面的检查...
I want my own psychiatric consultant to have full access to Falcone...

现在他们不能阻止我们

但是蝙蝠侠老喜欢捣乱
But the Batman has a talent for disruption.

我们把他逼到外面去 警察自然会逮住他 走

MAN 1: What about her? CRANE: She hasn't got long.

我给了他超浓缩的剂量
I gave her a concentrated dose.

我听说他会隐身

他为法尔科内工作吗？
Was he working for Falcone?

1057
01:27:13,244 --> 01:27:15,678
他提到了另一个人 一个更恶的人
He mentioned someone else, someone worse.

我要赶在毒剂对她 造成永久伤害前给她解毒
She needs the antidote before the damage is permanent.

No. They put it all in. They must've been at this for weeks.

...all that stopped me from calling the men in white coats...

1124
01:35:26,927 --> 01:35:29,478
...我之所以没有叫穿白大褂的人...
...was when you said it wasn't about thrill-seeking.

1125
01:35:29,478 --> 01:35:32,561
...就是因为你说了一句话 说你这不是寻找刺激
- It's not. - What would you call that?

...并不意味着向别人证明什么 包括他自己
It's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying.

1133
01:35:56,889 --> 01:35:59,403
是为了雷切尔 艾尔弗雷德 她当时要死了
She's downstairs, sedated. I need you to take her home.

Well, we both care for Rachel, but what you're doing has to be beyond that.

我们都关心雷切尔 可你做的已经超越了这一点
It can't be personal, or you're just a vigilante.

不是针对她一个人 或者你就是个义务警员

I don't care about my name.

1140
01:36:14,881 --> 01:36:18,086
我才不在乎名声呢
It's not just your name, sir. It's your father's name.

不止是你的名声 还有您父亲的
And it's all that's left of him.

Weeks. Why?

几个星期 怎么了？
Somebody's planning to disperse the toxin using the water supply.

1169
01:38:02,691 --> 01:38:05,649
有人打算利用供水系统 大范围投放致幻剂
The water supply won't help you disperse an inhalant.

1170
01:38:06,531 --> 01:38:07,884
这样做无法感染呼吸系统
What?

什么？
Unless you have a microwave emitter powerful enough...

除非使用大功率的微波蒸发器...

就像韦恩企业刚刚失窃的那种微波蒸发器一样
Misplaced?

1185
01:38:57,251 --> 01:38:58,479
你不是拉.阿勒古尔
I watched him die.

1186
01:38:58,479 --> 01:39:01,563
我亲眼看见他死的
DUCARD: But is Ra's al Ghul immortal?

1187
01:39:04,211 --> 01:39:06,566
杜卡德:可拉.阿勒古尔不是不朽的吗？
Are his methods supernatural?

1188
01:39:10,931 --> 01:39:15,163
他的意念不是超越现实的吗？
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal your true identity, Ra's?

1189
01:39:16,931 --> 01:39:21,243
或者简单的易容术就能隐藏起 你的真实面目把 杜卡德
Surely a man who spends his nights scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...

1190
01:39:21,243 --> 01:39:23,367
当然了 一个半夜里到处爬屋顶的人...
...wouldn't begrudge me dual identities.

1191
01:39:24,171 --> 01:39:25,889
...恐怕不会抱怨我的双重身份吧？
I saved your life.

1192
01:39:25,889 --> 01:39:28,440
我救了你的命
I warned you about compassion, Bruce.

1193
01:39:31,491 --> 01:39:33,607
我提醒过你不能怜悯 布鲁斯
Your quarrel is with me.

1194
01:39:34,451 --> 01:39:36,840
你是冲着我来的吧？
You let these people go.

1195
01:39:37,091 --> 01:39:40,243
让这些客人走吧
You are welcome to explain the situation to them.

1196
01:39:42,412 --> 01:39:43,970
那就麻烦你给他们解释一下吧
BRUCE: Everyone.

1197
01:39:44,732 --> 01:39:46,529
布鲁斯:诸位
Everybody?

1198
01:39:49,012 --> 01:39:50,809
诸位
I...

1199
01:39:51,252 --> 01:39:55,325
我...
I want to thank you all for coming here tonight and drinking all of my booze.

1200
01:39:55,325 --> 01:39:56,607
我很感谢大家今晚能 出席我的生日宴会喝光了我的酒
[GUESTS LAUGHING]

1201
01:39:57,332 --> 01:39:58,970
[笑声]
No, really.

1202
01:39:59,972 --> 01:40:02,611
不 真的
There's a thing about being a Wayne...

1203
01:40:02,611 --> 01:40:06,208
作为韦恩家族的一员我知道...
...that you're never short of a few freeloaders, like yourselves...

1204
01:40:06,208 --> 01:40:09,887
...身边少不了骗吃骗喝的人，就像你们...
...to fill up your mansion with. So here's to you people. Thank you.

1205
01:40:09,887 --> 01:40:12,566
...也只是为了撑场面凑人数 为了诸位干杯 谢谢你们
- That's enough, Bruce. - I'm not finished.

1206
01:40:12,892 --> 01:40:14,530
-太过分了 布鲁斯. -我还没说完
To all of you...

1207
01:40:14,530 --> 01:40:18,890
为你们这些....
All of you phonies, all of you two-faced friends...

1208
01:40:18,890 --> 01:40:23,921
所有这些虚伪的家伙 所有这些两面三刀的朋友...
...you sycophantic suck-ups who smile through your teeth at me...

1209
01:40:23,921 --> 01:40:27,528
...所有这些阿谀奉承之人 以及势力的小人们...
...please, leave me in peace.

1210
01:40:27,528 --> 01:40:30,206
...请你们让我清静清静吧
Please go.

1211
01:40:30,532 --> 01:40:33,808
请你们走吧
Stop smiling, it's not a joke. Please leave.

1212
01:40:33,808 --> 01:40:36,088
收起你们的假笑吧 我并不是开玩笑 请大家离开吧
The party's over, get out.

1213
01:40:36,088 --> 01:40:39,369
宴会结束了 现在滚吧
The apple has fallen very far from the tree, Mr. Wayne.

1214
01:40:44,012 --> 01:40:46,207
韦恩先生 你与你的 父母真是天壤之别
He's turning into a jerk.

1215
01:40:52,252 --> 01:40:53,924
他怎么变得这么古怪了
Amusing.

1216
01:40:54,212 --> 01:40:57,522
有意思
But pointless. None of these people have long to live.

1217
01:40:57,522 --> 01:41:01,048
但是无济于事 这些人都活不长了
Your antics at the asylum have forced my hand.

1218
01:41:01,048 --> 01:41:03,282
你的解毒药迫使我提前出手
So Crane was working for you.

1219
01:41:03,282 --> 01:41:07,127
这么说克兰是为你工作
His toxin is derived from the organic compound found in our blue flowers.

1220
01:41:07,452 --> 01:41:09,408
他的致幻剂是从我们的 蓝色花朵里提炼出来的
He was able to weaponize it.

1221
01:41:09,408 --> 01:41:11,483
他把它制成了武器
He's not a member of the League of Shadows?

1222
01:41:11,483 --> 01:41:16,009
他并不是影子同盟的成员
Of course not. He thought our plan was to hold the city to ransom.

1223
01:41:16,692 --> 01:41:21,050
当然不是 他以为我们要用致幻剂要挟政府呢
But really, you are gonna release Crane's poison on the entire city.

1224
01:41:21,050 --> 01:41:25,092
可你打算用克兰的毒剂污染整个城市
Then watch Gotham tear itself apart through fear.

1225
01:41:37,213 --> 01:41:39,249
然后欣赏整个哥特城陷入恐惧和毁灭的景象
BRUCE: You're gonna destroy millions of lives.

1226
01:41:39,453 --> 01:41:42,763
布鲁斯:你要毁掉几百万人的生命
DUCARD: Only a cynical man would call what these people have "lives," Wayne.

1227
01:41:42,763 --> 01:41:44,571
杜卡德:只有疯子才把这些人的生命当回事 韦恩
Crime. Despair.

1228
01:41:44,571 --> 01:41:46,724
罪恶 绝望
This is not how man was supposed to live.

1229
01:41:47,333 --> 01:41:50,370
人类的生活不该是这个样
The League of Shadows has been a check against human corruption...

1230
01:41:50,370 --> 01:41:51,966
影子同盟致力于缉查人类的腐败...
...for thousands of years.

1231
01:41:51,966 --> 01:41:55,569
...已历经千年
We sacked Rome. Loaded trade ships with plague rats.

1232
01:41:55,569 --> 01:41:57,086
我们毁灭了罗马 货船把鼠疫带到了世界各个角落
Burned London to the ground.

1233
01:41:57,086 --> 01:41:59,972
还把伦敦烧成了残垣断壁
Every time a civilization reaches the pinnacle of its decadence...

1234
01:41:59,972 --> 01:42:02,010
每一次文明一旦陷入腐败的泥沼...
...we return to restore the balance.

1235
01:42:02,010 --> 01:42:03,686
...我们就会出来维持平衡
Gotham isn't beyond saving.

1236
01:42:04,933 --> 01:42:07,527
哥特城还没有沦落到 不可救药的地步
Give me more time. There are good people here.

1237
01:42:07,527 --> 01:42:09,445
给我点时间 这里还有不少好人
You're defending a city so corrupt...

1238
01:42:09,445 --> 01:42:12,650
你要保护的城市...
...we have infiltrated every level of its infrastructure.

1239
01:42:23,293 --> 01:42:24,612
...我们已经渗透到社会的每一个阶层
Time to play.

1240
01:42:28,613 --> 01:42:31,173
游戏时间到了
When I found you in that jail, you were lost.

1241
01:42:31,173 --> 01:42:33,369
我在监狱里见到你的时候 你很迷失低落
But I believed in you.

1242
01:42:33,369 --> 01:42:37,128
但是现在 我恢复了对你的信心
I took away your fear, and I showed you a path.

1243
01:42:37,373 --> 01:42:39,523
我消除了你的恐惧 给你指明了出路
You were my greatest student.

1244
01:42:39,813 --> 01:42:42,850
你是我的得意门生
It should be you standing by my side, saving the world.

1245
01:42:43,613 --> 01:42:46,127
你应该站在我这一边 拯救世界
I'll be standing where I belong.

1246
01:42:46,733 --> 01:42:49,725
我将站在我该属于的一方
Between you and the people of Gotham.

1247
01:42:51,333 --> 01:42:53,847
站在你和哥特城人们中间
No one can save Gotham.

1248
01:42:57,053 --> 01:43:01,525
谁也救不了哥特城
When a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural.

1249
01:43:02,694 --> 01:43:07,165
当森林生长得过于茂盛的时候 一场大火的降临是再自然不过的
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror as its greatest city destroys itself.

1250
01:43:07,694 --> 01:43:10,811
明天 世界将共同瞩目 这个伟大的城市自己毁灭自己
The movement back to harmony will be unstoppable this time.

1251
01:43:11,094 --> 01:43:13,210
平衡的运动是不可阻挡的
- You attacked Gotham before? - Of course.

1252
01:43:13,414 --> 01:43:15,974
-以前你袭击过哥特城吗？ -当然
Over the ages our weapons have grown more sophisticated.

1253
01:43:15,974 --> 01:43:18,887
经过长时间的发展 我们的武器越来越先进
With Gotham we tried a new one. Economics.

1254
01:43:19,294 --> 01:43:23,810
在哥特城 我们采用 一种新型武器 经济
But we underestimated certain of Gotham's citizens...

1255
01:43:24,214 --> 01:43:26,330
但是我却低估了哥特城的一些市民...
...such as your parents.

1256
01:43:30,214 --> 01:43:33,570
...比如你的父母
Gunned down by one of the very people they were trying to help.

1257
01:43:33,814 --> 01:43:36,487
结果他们被他们一心要救助的人枪杀了
Create enough hunger and everyone becomes a criminal.

1258
01:43:36,487 --> 01:43:39,009
无处不在的饥饿使人人变成了罪犯
Their deaths galvanized the city into saving itself...

1259
01:43:39,009 --> 01:43:41,768
他们的死摧毁了这个城市的自救之心...
...and Gotham has limped on ever since.

1260
01:43:41,768 --> 01:43:43,652
...至此哥特城就一蹶不振了
We are back to finish the job.

1261
01:43:44,334 --> 01:43:47,451
我们这次来就是了结这一切的
And this time no misguided idealists will get in the way.

1262
01:43:47,451 --> 01:43:51,050
而这一次绝对不会有不得要领的理想主义者了
Like your father, you lack the courage to do all that is necessary.

1263
01:43:51,334 --> 01:43:54,087
跟你父母一样 你缺乏不惜一切代价的勇气
If someone stands in the way of true justice...

1264
01:43:54,087 --> 01:43:58,167
如果有人阻挡正义的实现...
...you simply walk up behind them and stab them in the heart.

1265
01:44:02,974 --> 01:44:05,044
...就应该从他们的背后狠狠地捅上一刀
- I am gonna stop you. - You never did learn...

1266
01:44:05,044 --> 01:44:07,170
-我要阻止你 -你还没学会...
...to mind your surroundings.

1267
01:44:09,254 --> 01:44:11,165
...眼观六路耳听八方
Justice is balance.

1268
01:44:11,165 --> 01:44:13,404
正义是公平的
You burned my house and left me for dead.

1269
01:44:15,974 --> 01:44:18,044
你曾经烧了我的房子 和置我于死地
Consider us even.

1270
01:44:33,774 --> 01:44:35,446

但我失败了
Why do we fall, sir?

1289
01:46:43,976 --> 01:46:47,332
为什么说失败 少爷？
So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.

我们学会了“哪里摔倒哪里爬起来”

02:03:36,466 --> 02:03:37,979
雷切尔:你打算将来怎么办?
Rebuild it.

1446
02:03:38,826 --> 02:03:41,101
重建庄园
Just the way it was, brick for brick.

1447
02:03:47,666 --> 02:03:48,860
恢复它从前的一砖一瓦
Just the way it was, sir?

1448
02:03:50,866 --> 02:03:52,060
和从前的一模一样?
Yeah, why?

1449
02:03:52,060 --> 02:03:54,945
你是什么意思?
I thought this might be a good opportunity for...

1450
02:03:54,945 --> 02:03:57,461
我是说这是个难得的机会...
...improving the foundations.

1451
02:03:57,461 --> 02:04:00,459
...应该重新完善一下地基
- In the southeast corner? - Precisely, sir.

1452
02:04:15,506 --> 02:04:18,259
-你是说东南角？ -对极啦
- Nice. - I couldn't find any mob bosses.

1453
02:04:19,186 --> 02:04:21,780
-怎么样？ -我连一个黑帮老大都见不到
BATMAN: Well, sergeant? - It's "lieutenant" now.

1454
02:04:22,106 --> 02:04:23,539
蝙蝠侠:是吗？上校 -现在是“中校”了
You really started something.

1455
02:04:23,539 --> 02:04:25,617
你干的真不错
Bent cops running scared.

1456
02:04:25,617 --> 02:04:27,139
坏警察都闻风丧胆了
Hope on the streets.

1457
02:04:27,386 --> 02:04:30,856
街道上也充满了希望
- But? - The Narrows is lost.

1458
02:04:31,346 --> 02:04:35,056
-还有呢？ -不过窄岛完了
And we still haven't picked up Crane or half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.

1459
02:04:35,707 --> 02:04:37,265
我们还没有抓到克兰 还有被他释放的一大半其他病人
We will.

1460
02:04:37,467 --> 02:04:39,059
会抓住他们的
We can bring Gotham back.

1461
02:04:39,059 --> 02:04:41,616
我要重建哥特城
- What about escalation? - Escalation?

1462
02:04:41,616 --> 02:04:45,939
-犯罪率增加怎么办？ -增加？
We start carrying semiautomatics, they buy automatics.

1463
02:04:45,939 --> 02:04:50,259
我们开始用半自动武器时 罪犯们已经用上全自动的了
We start wearing Kevlar, they buy armor-piercing rounds.

1464
02:04:50,259 --> 02:04:53,578
而当我们开始穿上防弹服的时候 他们却用起了金属爆裂子弹
- And? - And you're wearing a mask...

1465
02:04:53,987 --> 02:04:55,784
-还有吗？ -还有当你带着面具...
...and jumping off rooftops.

1466
02:04:57,147 --> 02:04:59,103
...从屋顶上跳下来的时候
Now, take this guy.

1467
02:04:59,347 --> 02:05:01,303
琢磨琢磨这家伙
Armed robbery, double homicide.

1468
02:05:01,303 --> 02:05:04,584
持枪抢劫犯 双料杀人犯
Got a taste for the theatrical, like you.

1469
02:05:04,827 --> 02:05:06,704
喜欢戏剧性 跟你一样
Leaves a calling card.

1470
02:05:12,347 --> 02:05:14,099
留下一张牌
I'll look into it.

1471
02:05:17,427 --> 02:05:18,826
这件事交给我吧
I never said thank you.

1472
02:05:23,707 --> 02:05:25,698
我从未谢过你
And you'll never have to.

1473
02:10:45,027 --> 02:10:47,101

没有这个必要
