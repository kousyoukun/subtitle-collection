1
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,684
Rachel, let me see.

2
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,853
-Can I see?
-Finders keepers. And I found it.

3
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:02,552
In my garden.

4
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,096
Finders keepers.

5
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,563
Bruce?

6
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,309
Bruce?

7
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:26,085
Mom! Mr. Alfred!

8
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,204
Did you have dream?

9
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,544
Nightmare.

10
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,385
Worse than this place?

11
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,341
They are going to fight you.

12
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,370
-Again?
-Until they kill you.

13
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,378
Can they kill me before breakfast?

14
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:34,584
You are in hell, little man.

15
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:40,656
And I am the devil.

16
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,498
You're not the devil.

17
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,030
You're practice.

18
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,807
Solitary.

19
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,878
-Why?
-For protection.

20
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,912
-I don't need protection.
-Protection for them.

21
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,578
Get in.

22
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,585
Are you so desperate
to fight criminals...

23
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,458
...that you lock yourself in
to take them on one at a time?

24
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:56,601
Actually, there were seven of them.

25
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,068
I counted six, Mr. Wayne.

26
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,071
How do you know my name?

27
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,304
The world is too small for someone
like Bruce Wayne to disappear...

28
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,813
...no matter how deep
he chooses to sink.

29
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,109
Who are you?

30
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,447
My name is merely Ducard,
but I speak for Ra's al Ghul...

31
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:18,250
...a man greatly feared
by the criminal underworld.

32
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,017
A man who can offer you a path.

33
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,419
What makes you think I need a path?

34
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,424
Someone like you is only here by choice.

35
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,966
You have been exploring
the criminal fraternity...

36
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:31,604
...but whatever your original intentions...

37
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:35,672
...you have become truly lost.

38
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,976
And what path can Ra's al Ghul offer?

39
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:45,141
The path of a man
who shares his hatred of evil...

40
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,549
...and wishes to serve true justice.

41
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,115
The path of the League of Shadows.

42
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,491
-You're vigilantes.
-No, no, no.

43
00:04:56,663 --> 00:05:00,861
A vigilante is just a man lost
in the scramble for his own gratification.

44
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,697
He can be destroyed or locked up.

45
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:10,875
But if you make yourself more
than just a man...

46
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,013
...if you devote yourself to an ideal...

47
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,672
...and if they can't stop you...

48
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,518
...then you become
something else entirely.

49
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,745
Which is?

50
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:26,225
Legend, Mr. Wayne.

51
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,153
Tomorrow, you will be released.

52
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,731
If you are bored of brawling with thieves
and want to achieve something...

53
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:36,358
...there is a rare blue flower
that grows on the eastern slopes.

54
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,231
Pick one of these flowers.

55
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:41,374
If you can carry it
to the top of the mountain...

56
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,340
...you may find what you were looking for
in the first place.

57
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,343
And what was I looking for?

58
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,016
Only you can know that.

59
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:01,779
You turn back. You go back.

60
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,413
Ra's al Ghul?

61
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,193
Wait.

62
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,502
What are you seeking?

63
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,432
I seek...

64
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,242
...the means to fight injustice.

65
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,707
To turn fear...

66
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,916
...against those
who prey on the fearful.

67
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:04,668
To manipulate the fears in others...

68
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,947
...you must first master your own.

69
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,280
Are you ready to begin?

70
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:14,745
I can.... I can barely stand.

71
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,287
Death does not wait for you to be ready!

72
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:20,585
Death is not considerate or fair!

73
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:25,723
And make no mistake,
here you face death.

74
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:30,967
Tiger.

75
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,369
Jujitsu.

76
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,634
Panther.

77
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,445
You're skilled. But this is not a dance.

78
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,480
And you are afraid.

79
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,292
But not of me.

80
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,256
Tell us, Mr. Wayne...

81
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,934
...what do you fear?

82
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,517
Bruce?

83
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,646
It's okay. It's okay.

84
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,314
You'll be okay.

85
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,891
Will we be needing an ambulance,
Master Wayne?

86
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:32,054
No, I'll set the bone
and take him for an x-ray later.

87
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:33,460
Very good, sir.

88
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:37,631
-I'm very sorry, sir. I've told--
-Don't worry. It's fine.

89
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,963
Took quite a fall,
didn't we, Master Bruce?

90
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,370
And why do we fall, Bruce?

91
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,771
So we can learn to pick ourselves up.

92
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,416
Just a little fall. It's just a small fracture.

93
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,192
The bats again?

94
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,494
You know why they attacked you,
don't you?

95
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,063
-They were afraid of you.
-Afraid of me?

96
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,207
All creatures feel fear.

97
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,740
Even the scary ones?

98
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,775
Especially the scary ones.

99
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,942
I got something to show you.

100
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:28,550
-You think your mother will like them?
-Yeah.

101
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,417
-I think it's time to get up.
-Maybe.

102
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,183
No going back to bed.

103
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,522
Did you build this train, Dad?

104
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:43,397
Gotham's been good to our family,
but the city's been suffering.

105
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:47,096
People less fortunate than us
have been enduring very hard times.

106
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:51,210
So we built a new, cheap, public
transportation system to unite the city.

107
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,072
And at the center...

108
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:55,077
...Wayne Tower.

109
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:58,149
-Is that where you work?
-No, I work at the hospital.

110
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:01,514
I leave the running of our company
to much better men.

111
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:03,553
-Better?
-Well...

112
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,987
...more interested men.

113
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:03,781
Can we go?

114
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,642
Please.

115
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,279
Okay. Let's go.

116
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:22,399
-What's wrong, Bruce?
-No, no. It was me.

117
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,662
I just needed some fresh air.

118
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:28,034
A little bit of opera goes a long way.
Right, Bruce?

119
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,373
Come on. Let's go.

120
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,581
Wallets, jewelry. Come on, fast.

121
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,118
-That's fine.
-Fast.

122
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,846
Take it easy.

123
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,081
Take it easy.

124
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,327
Here you go.

125
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:53,930
It's fine. It's fine.

126
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,929
Now just take it and go.

127
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,901
-I said, jewelry.
-Hey--

128
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,272
Thomas!

129
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,876
Bruce.

130
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,920
It's okay.

131
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,788
Don't be afraid.

132
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,389
Is this your father's?

133
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,057
It's okay.

134
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,893
Come here.

135
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,833
There you go.

136
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,967
It's okay.

137
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,612
It's okay.

138
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,109
Gordon.

139
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,787
Hey.

140
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,659
Good news.

141
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,000
We got him, son.

142
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,351
You're in excellent hands.

143
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,356
We'll be watching the empire.

144
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:03,518
When you grow up,
it'll be waiting for you.

145
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,640
I thought I might prepare a little supper.

146
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,879
-Very well.
-Alfred?

147
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,884
-Yes, Master Bruce?
-It was my fault, Alfred.

148
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,722
-I made them leave the theater.
-No.

149
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:40,923
-If I hadn't gotten scared....
-It was nothing that you did.

150
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:45,401
It was him, and him alone.

151
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,372
Do you understand?

152
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,570
I miss them, Alfred.
I miss them so much.

153
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,714
So do l, Master Bruce.

154
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,379
So do l.

155
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,490
And do you still feel responsible
for your parents' death?

156
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:06,784
My anger outweighs my guilt.

157
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,926
Come.

158
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,295
You have learned to bury
your guilt with anger.

159
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:19,495
I will teach you to confront it
and to face the truth.

160
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:26,968
You know how to fight six men.
We can teach you how to engage 600.

161
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:32,446
You know how to disappear.
We can teach you to become truly invisible.

162
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,815
lnvisible?

163
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:44,456
The ninja understands that invisibility
is a matter of patience and agility.

164
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,139
Always mind your surroundings.

165
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,510
Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.

166
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,248
-As weapons?
-Or distractions.

167
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,753
Theatricality and deception
are powerful agents.

168
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:14,250
You must become more than just a man
in the mind of your opponent.

169
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,689
-Who is he?
-He was a farmer.

170
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:22,095
Then he tried to take his neighbor's land
and became a murderer.

171
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,566
-Now he is a prisoner.
-What'll happen to him?

172
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:27,171
Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated.

173
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:31,276
Criminals thrive on the indulgence
of society's understanding.

174
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:38,147
Your parents' death was not your fault.

175
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:47,754
It was your father's.

176
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,480
Anger does not change the fact
that your father failed to act.

177
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,846
-The man had a gun.
-Would that stop you?

178
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,882
I've had training.

179
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,886
The training is nothing!

180
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,718
Will is everything!

181
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,329
The will to act.

182
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,338
Yield.

183
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,043
You haven't beaten me.

184
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,943
You have sacrificed sure footing
for a killing stroke.

185
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,353
Rub your chest.

186
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,725
Your arms will take care of themselves.

187
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,024
You are stronger than your father.

188
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,326
You didn't know my father.

189
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,799
But I know the rage that drives you.

190
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:09,999
That impossible anger strangling the grief,
until the memory of your loved one is just...

191
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,235
...poison in your veins.

192
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:16,871
And one day, you catch yourself wishing
the person you loved had never existed...

193
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,752
...so you'd be spared your pain.

194
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:27,157
I wasn't always here in the mountains.

195
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,820
Once, I had a wife.

196
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,698
My great love.

197
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:36,994
She was taken from me.

198
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:40,366
Like you, I was forced to learn
there are those without decency...

199
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,838
...who must be fought without hesitation,
without pity.

200
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,977
Your anger gives you great power.

201
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:52,008
But if you let it, it will destroy you...

202
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,417
...as it almost did me.

203
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,452
-What stopped it?
-Vengeance.

204
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:59,457
That's no help to me.

205
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,491
Why, Bruce?

206
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,322
Why could you not avenge your parents?

207
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:11,592
Will you be heading back to Princeton
after the hearing, sir...

208
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,433
...or can I persuade you to stay on
for a day or two?

209
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,836
I'm not heading back at all.

210
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,034
-You don't like it there?
-I like it fine.

211
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:22,243
They just don't feel the same way.

212
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:26,712
-I've prepared the master bedroom.
-No.

213
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,285
My room will be fine.

214
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,979
With all due respect, sir,
Wayne Manor is your house.

215
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,022
No, Alfred, it's my father's house.

216
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:35,683
-Your father is dead.
-This place is a mausoleum.

217
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,762
If I have my way, I'll pull
the damn thing down brick by brick.

218
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:43,027
This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered
six generations of your family.

219
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:45,898
Why do you give a damn, Alfred?
It's not your family.

220
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:50,607
I give a damn because a good man
once made me responsible...

221
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:53,438
...for what was most precious to him...

222
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,842
...in the whole world.

223
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:01,343
Miss Dawes has offered
to drive you to the hearing.

224
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,579
She probably hopes
to talk you out of going.

225
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:07,191
Should I just bury the past out there
with my parents, Alfred?

226
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,454
I wouldn't presume to tell you
what to do with your past, sir.

227
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:14,657
Just know that there are those of us who
care about what you do with your future.

228
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,559
Haven't given up on me yet?

229
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:19,727
Never.

230
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:11,688
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk
on the top shelf.

231
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,459
Hasn't he noticed
you're tall enough to reach now?

232
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,352
Old habits die hard, I guess.

233
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:18,895
-Never used to stop us anyway.
-No, it didn't.

234
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,964
How's your mom?

235
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,596
She misses this place.

236
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,628
So do l.

237
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,267
Yeah.

238
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,432
But it's nothing without the people
who made it what it was.

239
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,636
-Now there's only Alfred.
-And you.

240
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:38,340
-I'm not staying, Rachel.
-You're just back for the hearing.

241
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:46,152
Bruce, I don't suppose there's any way
to convince you not to come.

242
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,951
Someone at this proceeding...

243
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:52,790
...should stand for my parents.

244
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:55,092
We all loved your parents, Bruce.

245
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,498
-What Chill did is unforgivable.
-Then why is your boss letting him go?

246
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:03,103
In prison, he shared a cell
with Carmine Falcone.

247
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,938
He learned things, and he will testify
in exchange for early parole.

248
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,774
Rachel, this man killed my parents.

249
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,513
I cannot let that pass.

250
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:16,552
And I need you
to understand that, please.

251
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,519
Okay.

252
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:23,926
The depression hit working people,
like Mr. Chill, hardest of all.

253
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:29,295
His crime was appalling, yes, but it was
motivated not by greed, but by desperation.

254
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:33,165
Given the 14 years served, as well as
his extraordinary level of cooperation...

255
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:36,137
...with one of this office's
most important investigations...

256
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,471
...we strongly endorse his petition
for early release.

257
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,777
Mr. Chill?

258
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,012
Your Honor...

259
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,049
...not a day goes by that I don't wish
I could take back what I did.

260
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,925
Sure, I was desperate,
like a lot of people back then...

261
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:00,429
...but that don't change what I did.

262
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:08,734
I gather there is a member
of the Wayne family here today.

263
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:11,171
Has he got anything to say?

264
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:28,758
-He's coming out the side!
-He's coming out the side, guys!

265
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:39,768
Bruce Wayne!

266
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,769
Joe! Hey, Joe!

267
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:45,410
Falcone says hi.

268
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:59,349
Come on, Bruce.
We don't need to see this.

269
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:01,650
I do.

270
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,792
The DA couldn't understand why Judge Faden
insisted on making the hearing public.

271
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:13,370
Falcone paid him off
to get Chill out in the open.

272
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,835
Maybe I should thank them.

273
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,566
-You don't mean that.
-What if I do, Rachel?

274
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,677
My parents deserved justice.

275
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:22,746
You're not talking about justice.
You're talking about revenge.

276
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,816
-Sometimes, they're the same.
-No, they're never the same.

277
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:29,545
Justice is about harmony. Revenge is about
you making yourself feel better.

278
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:33,021
-Which is why we have an impartial system.
-Your system is broken.

279
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,931
You care about justice?
Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.

280
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:44,836
This city is rotting.

281
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,768
They talk about the depression
as if it's history. It's not.

282
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,430
Things are worse than ever here.

283
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,168
Falcone floods our streets
with crime and drugs...

284
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:55,279
...preying on the desperate,
creating new Joe Chills every day.

285
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,973
Falcone may not have killed
your parents, Bruce...

286
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,108
...but he's destroying everything
that they stood for.

287
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:08,558
You wanna thank him for that?
Here you go.

288
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:11,794
We all know where to find him.

289
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:15,593
As long as he keeps the bad people rich and
the good people scared, no one'll touch him.

290
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,931
Good people like your parents,
who'll stand against injustice, they're gone.

291
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:23,006
What chance does Gotham have
when the good people do nothing?

292
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:28,379
-I'm not one of your good people, Rachel.
-What do you mean?

293
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:33,847
All these years, I wanted to kill him.

294
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,149
Now I can't.

295
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:53,598
Your father would be ashamed of you.

296
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:39,607
You're taller than you look
in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.

297
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,917
No gun? I'm insulted.

298
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:48,958
-You could've just sent a thank-you note.
-I didn't come here to thank you.

299
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,824
I came to show you that
not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you.

300
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:53,624
Only those who know me, kid.

301
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:56,434
Look around you.
You'll see two councilmen...

302
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:59,601
...a union official, couple off-duty cops...

303
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,665
...and a judge.

304
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,106
Now, I wouldn't have a second's hesitation
of blowing your head off in front of them.

305
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:09,008
Now, that's power you can't buy.

306
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:11,081
That's the power of fear.

307
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:12,745
I'm not afraid of you.

308
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,818
Because you think you got
nothing to lose.

309
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:16,613
But you haven't thought it through.

310
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,917
You haven't thought about
your lady friend in the DA's office.

311
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,526
You haven't thought about
your old butler.

312
00:29:26,665 --> 00:29:28,997
People from your world...

313
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,534
...have so much to lose.

314
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:36,038
Now, you think because your mommy
and your daddy got shot...

315
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:39,177
...you know about the ugly side of life,
but you don't.

316
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,437
You've never tasted desperate.

317
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,173
You're.... You're Bruce Wayne,
the prince of Gotham.

318
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:47,751
You'd have to go 1000 miles to meet
someone who didn't know your name.

319
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,220
So don't come down here with your anger,
trying to prove something to yourself.

320
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,484
This is a world you'll never understand.

321
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,684
And you always fear...

322
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:59,296
...what you don't understand.

323
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,565
All right.

324
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:14,043
Yeah, you got spirit, kid.
I'll give you that.

325
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:16,180
More than your old man anyway.

326
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:20,648
In the joint, Chill told me about
the night he killed your parents.

327
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,049
He said your father begged for mercy.

328
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:26,152
Begged.

329
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,724
Like a dog.

330
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:42,335
Should've tipped better.

331
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,182
-For what?
-Your jacket.

332
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,345
Okay.

333
00:30:57,455 --> 00:31:00,914
Hey, hey, hey. Let me have it.
It's a nice coat.

334
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:03,186
Be careful who sees you with that.

335
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,695
-They're gonna come looking for me.
-Who?

336
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:07,859
Everyone.

337
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:11,931
lt's....

338
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:14,072
It's a nice coat.

339
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:36,759
When you lived among the criminals,
did you start to pity them?

340
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:40,626
The first time I stole
so that I wouldn't starve, yes.

341
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:46,293
I lost many assumptions about
the simple nature of right and wrong.

342
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,665
And when I traveled...

343
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:52,537
...I learned the fear before a crime...

344
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,871
...and the thrill of success.

345
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,615
But I never became one of them.

346
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,023
Fool. What do I care what your name is?
You're a criminal.

347
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,257
Tell that to the guy who owned these.

348
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:16,423
You've traveled the world to understand
the criminal mind and conquer your fears.

349
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:22,632
But a criminal is not complicated.

350
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:26,141
And what you really fear
is inside yourself.

351
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,871
You fear your own power.

352
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:30,310
You fear your anger...

353
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:35,048
...the drive to do great or terrible things.

354
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,656
Now you must journey inwards.

355
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,520
You are ready.

356
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:46,930
Breathe.

357
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,374
Breathe.

358
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,214
Breathe in your fears.

359
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:08,842
Face them.

360
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:13,154
To conquer fear, you must become fear.

361
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,726
You must bask in the fear of other men.

362
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:21,599
And men fear most
what they cannot see.

363
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,684
You have to become a terrible thought.

364
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:47,452
A wraith.

365
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,531
You have to become an idea!

366
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:05,467
Feel terror cloud your senses.

367
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,409
Feel its power to distort.

368
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,612
To control.

369
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:20,488
And know that this power can be yours.

370
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:35,700
Embrace your worst fear.

371
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:44,978
Become one with the darkness.

372
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,531
Focus.

373
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:08,999
Concentrate.

374
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:11,267
Master your senses.

375
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,805
You cannot leave any sign.

376
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:43,402
I haven't.

377
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:53,674
lmpressive.

378
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,890
We have purged your fear.

379
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,657
You are ready to lead these men.

380
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:11,359
You are ready to become a member
of the League of Shadows.

381
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:18,169
But first, you must demonstrate
your commitment to justice.

382
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:36,291
No.

383
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,025
I'm no executioner.

384
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:43,261
Your compassion is a weakness
your enemies will not share.

385
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,899
That's why it's so important.

386
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,900
It separates us from them.

387
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:50,473
You want to fight criminals.
This man is a murderer.

388
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,439
-This man should be tried.
-By whom?

389
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,305
Corrupt bureaucrats?

390
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:56,970
Criminals mock society's laws.

391
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,446
You know this better than most.

392
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:02,912
You cannot lead these men...

393
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:07,081
...unless you are prepared to do
what is necessary to defeat evil.

394
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:10,127
And where would I be leading
these men?

395
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:11,924
Gotham.

396
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:14,156
As Gotham's favored son...

397
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:18,667
...you will be ideally placed
to strike at the heart of criminality.

398
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:22,802
-How?
-Gotham's time has come.

399
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:26,307
Like Constantinople or Rome before it...

400
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:30,676
...the city has become a breeding ground
for suffering and injustice.

401
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:34,444
It is beyond saving
and must be allowed to die.

402
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:39,818
This is the most important function
of the League of Shadows.

403
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:43,186
It is one we've performed for centuries.

404
00:37:43,528 --> 00:37:45,257
Gotham...

405
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,331
...must be destroyed.

406
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:53,160
You can't believe in this.

407
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:57,899
Ra's al Ghul rescued us from
the darkest corners of our own hearts.

408
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:02,479
What he asks in return is the courage
to do what is necessary.

409
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:06,047
I will go back to Gotham
and I will fight men like this...

410
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:08,777
...but I will not become an executioner.

411
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,512
Bruce, please.

412
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,521
For your own sake,
there is no turning back.

413
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:48,416
-What are you doing?
-What's necessary, my friend.

414
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:07,958
I will tell him you saved his life.

415
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:29,243
Master Wayne,
you've been gone a long time.

416
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,684
-Yes, I have.
-You look very fashionable.

417
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:34,691
Apart from the mud.

418
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:37,621
Are you coming back to Gotham
for long, sir?

419
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:39,024
As long as it takes.

420
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:40,687
I want to show the people...

421
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:44,301
...their city doesn't belong
to the criminals and the corrupt.

422
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:47,665
In the depression, your father nearly
bankrupted Wayne Enterprises...

423
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,067
...combating poverty.

424
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:53,767
He believed his example could inspire
the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.

425
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,671
Did it?

426
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:58,282
In a way.

427
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:01,509
Their murder shocked the wealthy
and the powerful into action.

428
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,581
People need dramatic examples
to shake them out of apathy.

429
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:08,418
I can't do that as Bruce Wayne.

430
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:10,117
As a man...

431
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:12,695
...I'm flesh and blood,
I can be ignored, destroyed.

432
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,797
But as a symbol....

433
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,895
As a symbol, I can be incorruptible.

434
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:21,698
-I can be everlasting.
-What symbol?

435
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:24,968
Something elemental...

436
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:26,769
...something terrifying.

437
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:29,038
I assume that as you take on
the underworld...

438
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:34,344
...this symbol is a persona to protect
those you care about from reprisals?

439
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:35,884
You're thinking about Rachel?

440
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:38,420
Actually, sir, I was thinking of myself.

441
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:42,187
Have you told anyone I'm coming back?

442
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:46,591
I couldn't figure the legal ramifications
of bringing you back from the dead.

443
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:48,664
-Dead?
-You've been gone seven years.

444
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:50,095
You had me declared dead?

445
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:53,169
Actually, it was Mr. Earle.
He's taking the company public.

446
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:55,601
He wanted to liquidate
your majority shareholding.

447
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:58,105
Those shares are worth
quite a bit of money.

448
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:01,006
Well, it's a good thing
I left everything to you, then.

449
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:03,275
Quite so, sir.

450
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:07,077
And you can borrow the Rolls, if you like.
Just bring it back with a full tank.

451
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:21,861
In my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much
a danger to himself as to others...

452
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:26,795
...and prison is probably not
the best environment for his rehabilitation.

453
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,700
-Dr. Crane.
-Miss Dawes.

454
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:35,141
You think a man who butchers people
for the mob doesn't belong in jail?

455
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:37,975
I would hardly have testified to that
otherwise, would l?

456
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:41,243
This is the third of Falcone's thugs
you've had declared insane...

457
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:42,818
...and moved into your asylum.

458
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:47,684
Well, the work offered by organized crime
must have an attraction to the insane.

459
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:51,217
Or the corrupt.

460
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,057
Mr. Finch.

461
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:57,197
You should check
with Miss Dawes here...

462
00:43:57,368 --> 00:44:01,737
...just what implications your office
has authorized her to make. If any.

463
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:08,042
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing, Carl?

464
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:09,577
Looking out for you.

465
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:14,984
Falcone has half the city
bought and paid for.

466
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,211
-Drop it.
-How can you say that?

467
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:21,085
Because as much as I care about
getting Falcone, I care more about you.

468
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:22,555
That's sweet.

469
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:30,331
We've been through all that.

470
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:57,860
Blessed bat again, sir.

471
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:00,729
They nest somewhere in the grounds.

472
00:46:58,615 --> 00:47:01,312
No more favors.
Someone is sniffing around.

473
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:04,455
Hey, I scratch your back,
you scratch mine, doc.

474
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:05,987
I'm bringing in the shipments.

475
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:07,919
We are paying you for that.

476
00:47:08,092 --> 00:47:10,583
Maybe money isn't as interesting
to me as favors.

477
00:47:13,097 --> 00:47:17,898
I am more than aware that you are
not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.

478
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:21,129
But you know who I'm working for,
and when he gets here--

479
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,239
He-- He's coming to Gotham?

480
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:24,840
Yes, he is.

481
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,477
And when he gets here,
he's not going to wanna hear...

482
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:32,742
...that you have endangered our operation
just to get your thugs out of a little jail time.

483
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:37,085
-Who's bothering you?
-There's a girl at the DA's office.

484
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:39,352
-We'll buy her off.
-Not this one.

485
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:42,391
ldealist, huh?

486
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,289
Well, there's an answer to that too.

487
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:47,631
-I don't want to know.
-Yes, you do.

488
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:55,238
No, we are showing very healthy growth
in these sectors.

489
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:58,603
I don't think Thomas Wayne would have
viewed heavy-arms manufacture...

490
00:47:58,776 --> 00:48:00,903
...as a suitable cornerstone
for our business.

491
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:06,113
Well, that's 20 years ago, Fredericks.

492
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:09,579
I think after 20 years
we can allow ourselves...

493
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:12,620
...to stop thinking about what
Thomas Wayne would have done.

494
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:14,655
Good morning, Mr. Earle's office.

495
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:18,124
Yes, he's confirmed for
the dinner tomorrow evening.

496
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:21,595
Good morning. I'm here to see Mr. Earle.

497
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:23,290
Name?

498
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,395
Bruce Wayne.

499
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:30,764
Thomas would probably not
have taken the company public.

500
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:35,071
But that is what we,
as responsible managers, are going to do.

501
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,305
Jessica?

502
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:40,908
Jessica? Where are you?

503
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:45,351
-Eye on the ball, and....
-Why is no one answering the phone?

504
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:49,186
It's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle.
I'm sure they'll call back.

505
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:52,018
Bruce? You're supposed to be dead.

506
00:48:52,196 --> 00:48:54,130
I'm sorry to disappoint.

507
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:57,028
-I need you to take a look at this.
-Have you seen him yet?

508
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:58,859
-Who?
-Wayne.

509
00:48:59,203 --> 00:49:01,262
It's been all over the news.
He's back.

510
00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:08,110
I'm sure you realize
I can't stop the big machine.

511
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,507
Too many wheels turning.

512
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:11,704
-We're going public.
-I understand.

513
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:14,981
And I'll be handsomely rewarded
for my shares.

514
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:17,712
I'm not looking to interfere.

515
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:20,282
-I am looking for a job.
-Oh?

516
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:23,518
I just want to get to know the company
that my family built.

517
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:25,591
Any ideas where you would start?

518
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:28,463
Applied Sciences caught my eye.

519
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:30,562
Fox's department.

520
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:32,725
I'll let him know you're coming.

521
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,402
You look like him. Your dad.

522
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:39,870
You're the only one left
of the Wayne family.

523
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:44,003
This is where you belong.
Welcome home.

524
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:48,813
Environmental procedures, defense projects,
consumer products.

525
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:52,050
All prototypes. None in production.

526
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:54,885
-On any level whatsoever.
-None?

527
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:57,725
What did they tell you this place was?

528
00:49:57,894 --> 00:49:59,920
They didn't tell me anything.

529
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:05,824
Earle told me exactly what it was
when he sent me down here.

530
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:07,771
Dead end.

531
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:11,272
Place to keep me from causing
the board any more trouble.

532
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:13,699
Come on.

533
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:16,346
-You were on the board?
-When your father ran things.

534
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,413
-You knew my father?
-Oh, yeah.

535
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:20,209
Helped him build his train.

536
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:22,444
Here we are.

537
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:27,750
Kevlar utility harness.

538
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:30,093
Gas-powered, magnetic grapple gun.

539
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,558
The 350-pound test monofilament.

540
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:38,095
Wonderful project, your dad's train.

541
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:43,198
Routed it right into Wayne Tower,
along with the water and power utilities.

542
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:46,605
Kind of made Wayne Tower
the unofficial center of Gotham City.

543
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,438
Of course, Earle let it go to rot.
Here we are.

544
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:53,442
Nomex survival suit
for advanced infantry.

545
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:56,381
Kevlar biweave, reinforced joints.

546
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,087
-Tear-resistant?
-This sucker will stop a knife.

547
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:01,486
-Bulletproof?
-Anything but a straight shot.

548
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:05,254
-Why didn't they put it into production?
-Bean counters didn't think a soldier's life...

549
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:07,056
...was worth 300 grand.

550
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:11,601
So, what's your interest in it, Mr. Wayne?

551
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:13,793
I want to borrow it.

552
00:51:13,971 --> 00:51:15,734
For spelunking.

553
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:17,904
Spelunking?

554
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,804
Yeah, you know, cave diving?

555
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,740
You expecting to run into
much gunfire in these caves?

556
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:29,348
Look, I'd rather Mr. Earle
didn't know about me borrowing--

557
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:30,748
Mr. Wayne...

558
00:51:30,988 --> 00:51:32,888
...the way I see it...

559
00:51:33,357 --> 00:51:35,791
...all this stuff is yours anyway.

560
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:41,254
Okay. Give it a try.

561
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:46,631
Charming.

562
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:51,270
At least you'll have company.

563
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:57,136
This must be the lowest foundation
of the southeast wing.

564
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:13,825
In the Civil War, your great-great-grandfather
was involved in the Underground Railroad...

565
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:16,967
...secretly transporting freed slaves
to the North...

566
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:20,831
...and I suspect these caverns
came in handy.

567
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:35,713
Alfred! Come up here!

568
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:38,854
I can see everything all right
from down here, sir, thank you.

569
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:01,537
We order the main part
of this cowl from Singapore.

570
00:53:01,711 --> 00:53:03,202
Via a dummy corporation.

571
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,246
lndeed. And then, quite separately...

572
00:53:05,415 --> 00:53:10,353
...we place an order
to a Chinese company for these.

573
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:13,857
-Put it together ourselves.
-Precisely.

574
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:18,052
They'll have to be large orders,
to avoid suspicion.

575
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:20,788
-How large?
-Say 10,000.

576
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,235
-Well, at least we'll have spares.
-Yes.

577
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,379
Don't suppose you want a taste.

578
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:48,718
I just keep offering,
thinking maybe someday you'll get wise.

579
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,054
There's nothing wise
in what you do, Flass.

580
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:54,595
Well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste,
makes us guys nervous.

581
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:56,630
I'm no rat.

582
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:03,067
In a town this bent,
who's there to rat to anyway?

583
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,897
Don't turn around.

584
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:38,567
You're a good cop.
One of the few.

585
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:40,369
What do you want?

586
00:54:40,544 --> 00:54:43,707
Carmine Falcone brings in
shipments of drugs every week.

587
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,678
Nobody takes him down. Why?

588
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,211
He's paid up with the right people.

589
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:52,284
What will it take to bring him down?

590
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:55,423
Leverage on Judge Faden...

591
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,526
...and a DA brave enough
to prosecute.

592
00:54:58,929 --> 00:55:00,556
Rachel Dawes.

593
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,257
Who are you?

594
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:04,293
Watch for my sign.

595
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,995
You're just one man?

596
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:10,873
Now we're two.

597
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,569
We?

598
00:55:30,227 --> 00:55:31,956
Freeze!

599
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:51,080
What the hell was that?

600
00:55:53,984 --> 00:55:55,212
Just some nut.

601
00:55:58,622 --> 00:56:01,420
Well, what is it today? More spelunking?

602
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:04,060
No. Today it's BASE-jumping.

603
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:06,288
BASE-jumping.

604
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,423
-That like parachuting?
-Kind of.

605
00:56:10,634 --> 00:56:13,432
Do you have any lightweight fabrics?

606
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:16,266
You know, I think I have just the thing.

607
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:20,042
It's called memory cloth.
Notice anything?

608
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,280
Regularly flexible...

609
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:27,810
...but put a current through it...

610
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:32,949
-...molecules realign, it becomes rigid.
-What kind of shapes can you make?

611
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:36,251
Can be tailored to fit any structure
based on a rigid skeleton.

612
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:37,655
Too expensive for the Army?

613
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:42,561
I don't think they tried to market it to the
billionaire, spelunking, BASE-jumping crowd.

614
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,530
-Look, Mr. Fox.
-Yes, sir?

615
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:46,567
If you're uncomfortable--

616
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:49,933
Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me
exactly what you're doing...

617
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:52,075
...when I'm asked, I don't have to lie.

618
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:56,438
But don't think of me as an idiot.

619
00:56:57,947 --> 00:56:59,916
Fair enough.

620
00:57:01,851 --> 00:57:03,649
What's that?

621
00:57:05,689 --> 00:57:07,657
The Tumbler?

622
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:10,126
Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.

623
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:18,067
She was built as a bridging vehicle.

624
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:24,474
During combat, two of these
would jump over a river, towing cables.

625
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:30,639
Over here on the throttle,
flip that open and throttle up.

626
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:33,374
This will boost you into a rampless jump--
Not now!

627
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:38,347
Not-- Not now, sir.

628
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:43,057
Afterburner disengaged.

629
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:46,453
We never could get
the damn bridge to work...

630
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,359
...but this baby works just fine.

631
00:57:57,907 --> 00:57:59,136
So, what do you think?

632
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:02,401
Does it come in black?

633
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:05,412
I need you at the docks Thursday.

634
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:07,549
-Problems?
-I don't want any trouble...

635
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:09,811
-...with the last shipment.
-Sure.

636
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:15,085
Word on the street is you got a beef
with somebody in the DA's office.

637
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:17,659
-Is that right?
-And that there's a fat prize...

638
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:20,524
...waiting for anybody willing
to do anything about it.

639
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:22,665
So, what's your point, Mr. Flass?

640
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:24,361
Have you seen the girl?

641
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:27,563
It's a cute little assistant DA.

642
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:31,401
Don't you think that's a little bit
too much heat to bring down, maybe?

643
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:34,874
-Even for this town.
-Never underestimate Gotham City.

644
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:37,878
People get mugged coming home
from work every day of the week.

645
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:40,676
Sometimes--
Sometimes things just go bad.

646
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:46,352
It's a problem with the graphite, sir.

647
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:49,253
The next 10,000
will be up to specifications.

648
00:58:49,426 --> 00:58:51,986
-At least they gave us a discount.
-Quite.

649
00:58:52,162 --> 00:58:57,794
In the meantime, sir, may I suggest
you try to avoid landing on your head?

650
00:59:34,804 --> 00:59:36,829
Why bats, Master Wayne?

651
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,336
Bats frighten me.

652
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:41,907
It's time my enemies shared my dread.

653
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,539
What is this?

654
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:15,636
Continue.

655
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:22,845
Looks fine out there.

656
01:00:23,253 --> 01:00:25,153
The bears go straight to the dealers.

657
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:27,984
Yeah, and the rabbits go
to the man in the Narrows.

658
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:31,184
-What's the difference?
-lgnorance is bliss, my friend.

659
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:34,524
Don't burden yourself
with the secrets of scary people.

660
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:53,349
Hey. Steiss.

661
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,138
Steiss?

662
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:29,677
What?

663
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:31,921
What the...?

664
01:01:40,897 --> 01:01:42,763
I better check it.

665
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:57,302
There's a problem out here.
You better bail.

666
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:28,236
Where are you?!

667
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,469
Here.

668
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:53,833
Get going. Oh, shit.

669
01:03:11,988 --> 01:03:14,115
What the hell are you?

670
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,320
I'm Batman.

671
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:28,637
Nice coat.

672
01:03:30,373 --> 01:03:31,897
Thanks.

673
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:14,177
Hold it.

674
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,788
That's right, you better run.

675
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:29,596
Falcone sent them to kill you.

676
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,294
-Why?
-You rattled his cage.

677
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:38,632
-What's this?
-Leverage.

678
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:40,401
-For what?
-To get things moving.

679
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,701
Who are you?

680
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:44,341
Someone like you.

681
01:04:44,514 --> 01:04:46,539
Someone who'll rattle the cages.

682
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:55,147
Ma'am? Everything okay?

683
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:01,954
-Falcone's men?
-Does it matter?

684
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:04,395
We'll never tie him to it anyway.

685
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:06,727
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

686
01:05:19,782 --> 01:05:21,614
What the hell is that?

687
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:32,490
Cut him down.

688
01:05:55,084 --> 01:05:56,313
Unacceptable.

689
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:59,319
Now, I don't care if it's rival gangs,
Guardian Angels...

690
01:05:59,488 --> 01:06:01,457
...or the goddamn Salvation Army...

691
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:04,056
...get them off the street
and off the front page.

692
01:06:04,227 --> 01:06:06,787
They say it was just one guy.
Or a creature.

693
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,659
It was some asshole in a costume.

694
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:11,861
-Yeah?
-This guy did deliver us...

695
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:14,799
...one of the city's biggest crime lords.

696
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:18,464
No one takes the law
into their own hands in my city.

697
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:19,870
Understand?

698
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:22,611
-No way to bury it now.
-There's still Judge Faden.

699
01:06:22,778 --> 01:06:25,976
-I've got Faden covered.
-What about this bat they're babbling about?

700
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:29,141
Even if these guys will swear
to being thrashed by a giant bat...

701
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:31,480
...we've got Falcone at the scene.

702
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:34,851
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests.
This bat character gave us everything.

703
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:36,816
Okay. Let's do it.

704
01:06:40,263 --> 01:06:42,356
-Bats are nocturnal.
-Bats may be.

705
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:45,967
But even for billionaire playboys,
3:00 is pushing it.

706
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,870
The price for leading a double life, I fear.

707
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,641
Your theatrics made an impression.

708
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:58,037
Theatricality and deception...

709
01:06:58,214 --> 01:07:01,445
...are powerful weapons, Alfred.
This is a good start.

710
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:04,416
If those are to be the first
of many injuries to come...

711
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:07,420
...it would be wise
to find a suitable excuse.

712
01:07:07,723 --> 01:07:09,089
Polo, for instance.

713
01:07:09,258 --> 01:07:10,885
I'm not learning polo, Alfred.

714
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:14,824
Strange injuries,
a nonexistent social life.

715
01:07:14,997 --> 01:07:16,465
These things beg the question...

716
01:07:16,632 --> 01:07:20,865
...as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne
do with his time and his money.

717
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:22,629
What does someone like me do?

718
01:07:23,572 --> 01:07:27,805
Drive sports cars, date movie stars.

719
01:07:28,477 --> 01:07:30,036
Buy things that are not for sale.

720
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:33,774
Who knows, Master Wayne,
you start pretending to have fun...

721
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:36,374
...you might even have a little
by accident.

722
01:07:39,088 --> 01:07:40,556
Sir.

723
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:43,055
-We have a situation.
-All right.

724
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:47,259
The Coast Guard picked up
one of our cargo ships last night...

725
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:52,597
...heavily damaged, all crew missing,
probably dead.

726
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:59,039
The ship was carrying a prototype weapon.
It's a microwave emitter.

727
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:02,178
It's designed for desert warfare, but it--

728
01:08:03,846 --> 01:08:05,405
It looks like somebody...

729
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:11,309
...turned it on.

730
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:19,928
It uses focused microwaves to
vaporize the enemy's water supply.

731
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:30,806
The damage to the ship
was catastrophic.

732
01:08:30,973 --> 01:08:33,965
The weapon itself is....

733
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:36,768
Missing?

734
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:38,876
Yeah.

735
01:08:40,182 --> 01:08:42,117
Mr. Wayne.

736
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:47,288
Nice car.

737
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:48,856
You should see my other one.

738
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:00,802
He's done something
the police never have.

739
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:03,268
You can't take the law
into your own hands.

740
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,999
Well, at least he's getting
something done.

741
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:08,507
Bruce, help me out here.

742
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:13,047
Well, a guy who dresses up
like a bat clearly has issues.

743
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:16,313
But he's put Falcone behind bars.

744
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:18,852
Now the cops want to bring him in.
What does that tell you?

745
01:09:19,021 --> 01:09:20,250
They're jealous.

746
01:09:20,423 --> 01:09:23,051
Sir, the pool is for decoration...

747
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:26,593
...and your friends
do not have swimwear.

748
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:30,366
Well, they're European.

749
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:34,601
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

750
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:38,963
-It is not a question of money.
-Well, you see...

751
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:41,339
...I'm buying this hotel...

752
01:09:43,145 --> 01:09:47,548
...and setting some new rules
about the pool area.

753
01:09:48,717 --> 01:09:51,118
I think the Batman deserves a medal.

754
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:53,414
And a straitjacket to pin it on.

755
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:01,488
Thank you.

756
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:04,597
Bruce?

757
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:09,968
Rachel?

758
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:11,538
I'd heard you were back.

759
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:15,077
What are you doing?

760
01:10:15,845 --> 01:10:20,282
Just swimming here.
Wow, it is good to see you.

761
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:21,974
You were gone a long time.

762
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:25,487
-I know. How are things?
-The same.

763
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:29,051
Job's getting worse.

764
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:31,955
Can't change the world on your own.

765
01:10:32,127 --> 01:10:34,187
What choice do I have...

766
01:10:34,864 --> 01:10:36,627
...when you're too busy swimming?

767
01:10:37,933 --> 01:10:39,993
Rachel, all of--

768
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:41,929
All this....

769
01:10:43,372 --> 01:10:47,400
lt's-- It's not me. lt's....

770
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:50,471
Inside, I am....

771
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,615
I am more.

772
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:55,842
Come on, Bruce. Come on.

773
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:59,818
Bruce, we have some more hotels
for you to buy.

774
01:11:00,856 --> 01:11:02,324
Bruce...

775
01:11:03,459 --> 01:11:06,986
...deep down you may still be
that same great kid you used to be.

776
01:11:09,398 --> 01:11:11,992
But it's not who you are underneath...

777
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:14,198
...it's what you do that defines you.

778
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:28,342
Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.

779
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:31,384
Not at all. He cut his wrists?

780
01:11:31,554 --> 01:11:35,217
Probably looking for the insanity plea.
But if anything should happen....

781
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:38,326
Of course, better safe than sorry.

782
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:45,325
Yeah, Dr. Crane, I can't take it anymore.
It's all too much.

783
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:47,970
The walls are closing in. Blah, blah, blah.

784
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:51,030
A couple of days of this food,
it'll be true.

785
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:53,702
-What do you want?
-I wanna know...

786
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:56,345
...how you're gonna convince me
to keep my mouth shut.

787
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:58,708
About what?
You don't know anything.

788
01:11:58,881 --> 01:12:03,045
I know you don't want the cops to take
a closer look at the drugs they seized.

789
01:12:03,219 --> 01:12:07,383
And I know about your experiments
with the inmates of your nut house.

790
01:12:07,556 --> 01:12:11,220
See, I don't go into business with a guy
without finding out his dirty secrets.

791
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:14,695
And those goons you used.

792
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:16,695
I own the muscle in this town.

793
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:20,267
Now, I've been bringing
your stuff in for months...

794
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:25,001
...so whatever he's planning,
it's big, and I want in.

795
01:12:26,308 --> 01:12:29,437
Well, I already know what he'll say.

796
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:31,210
That we should kill you.

797
01:12:33,115 --> 01:12:36,415
Even he can't get me in here.
Not in my town.

798
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:43,882
Would you like to see my mask?

799
01:12:45,461 --> 01:12:46,894
I use it in my experiments.

800
01:12:49,398 --> 01:12:53,858
Now, I'm probably not very frightening
to a guy like you.

801
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:57,068
But these crazies, they can't stand it.

802
01:12:57,973 --> 01:12:59,964
So when did the nut
take over the nut house?

803
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:03,606
They scream and they cry...

804
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:06,207
...much as you're doing now.

805
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:11,748
Well, he's not faking. Not that one.

806
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,480
I'll talk to the judge
and see if I can get him moved...

807
01:13:14,657 --> 01:13:18,058
...to the secure wing at Arkham.
I can't treat him here.

808
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:41,572
Storm's coming.

809
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:49,180
The scum is getting jumpy
because you stood up to Falcone.

810
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:52,885
It's a start. Your partner
was at the docks with Falcone.

811
01:13:53,062 --> 01:13:55,758
Well, he moonlights
as a low-level enforcer.

812
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:59,931
They were splitting the shipment in two.
Only half went to the dealers.

813
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:02,036
Why? What about the other half?

814
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:04,905
-Flass knows.
-He won't talk.

815
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:07,099
He'll talk to me.

816
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:10,302
Commissioner Loeb set up
a massive task force to catch you.

817
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:13,305
-He thinks you're dangerous.
-What do you think?

818
01:14:15,084 --> 01:14:17,518
I think you're trying to help.

819
01:14:22,524 --> 01:14:24,823
But I've been wrong before.

820
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:32,328
Come on, I ain't got all night.

821
01:14:35,704 --> 01:14:37,502
Flass, I have kids to feed.

822
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:40,135
What, they don't like falafel?

823
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:57,253
Where were the other drugs going?

824
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,722
I never knew. I don't know.

825
01:15:00,896 --> 01:15:03,092
-I swear to God.
-Swear to me!

826
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:11,730
I don't-- I don't know.
I never knew. Never.

827
01:15:12,107 --> 01:15:15,441
They went to some guy for a couple days
before they went to the dealers.

828
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:16,942
Why?

829
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:21,174
There was something--
Something else in the drugs...

830
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:22,943
-...something hidden.
-What?

831
01:15:23,118 --> 01:15:26,452
I never went to the drop-off point.
It was in the Narrows.

832
01:15:26,622 --> 01:15:29,887
-Cops only go there when they're in force.
-Do I look like a cop?

833
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:31,856
No--

834
01:15:45,474 --> 01:15:47,499
This is the one I'm talking about.

835
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:50,074
-What's your problem with it?
-It shouldn't exist.

836
01:15:50,245 --> 01:15:54,114
This ship left Singapore with
246 containers, but arrived with 247.

837
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:56,410
I'm guessing there's something
I'm not supposed to find in there.

838
01:15:56,585 --> 01:16:00,214
Listen, counselor, we don't wanna know
what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.

839
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:03,722
Things are working
a little differently now. Open it up.

840
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:14,564
What the hell is this?

841
01:16:57,179 --> 01:17:00,342
It's you, isn't it?
Everybody's been talking about you.

842
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:02,679
Get in here!

843
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:05,413
The other kids won't believe me.

844
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:30,638
Get rid of all traces.

845
01:17:30,946 --> 01:17:33,847
-Better torch the whole place.
-All right.

846
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:11,682
Having trouble?

847
01:18:12,387 --> 01:18:14,754
Take a seat. Have a drink.

848
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:18,688
You look like a man
who takes himself too seriously.

849
01:18:22,397 --> 01:18:25,390
Do you want my opinion?
You need to lighten up.

850
01:19:17,386 --> 01:19:21,083
Alfred, help me.

851
01:19:30,999 --> 01:19:34,367
Blood. Take. Take poison. Blood poison.

852
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:37,506
Poisonous. Poisonous.

853
01:19:41,843 --> 01:19:43,539
Bruce...

854
01:19:44,813 --> 01:19:46,008
...why do we fall?

855
01:19:57,993 --> 01:20:01,326
-How long was I out?
-Two days.

856
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:03,596
It's your birthday.

857
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:06,163
Many happy returns.

858
01:20:11,373 --> 01:20:15,207
I've felt these effects before,
but this was so much more potent.

859
01:20:15,377 --> 01:20:19,939
It was some kind of hallucinogen,
weaponized, in aerosol form.

860
01:20:20,115 --> 01:20:23,085
You have been hanging out
in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.

861
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:26,312
I called Mr. Fox when your condition
worsened after the first day.

862
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:31,551
I analyzed your blood, isolating the receptor
compounds and the protein-based catalyst.

863
01:20:31,726 --> 01:20:33,490
Am I meant to understand any of that?

864
01:20:33,895 --> 01:20:37,058
Not at all. I just wanted you to know
how hard it was.

865
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:41,330
-Bottom line, I synthesized an antidote.
-Could you make more?

866
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:44,199
You planning on gassing yourself
again, Mr. Wayne?

867
01:20:44,406 --> 01:20:47,466
Well, you know how it is.
You're out at night, looking for kicks...

868
01:20:47,642 --> 01:20:50,407
...someone's passing around
the weaponized hallucinogens....

869
01:20:50,579 --> 01:20:54,015
I'll bring what I have.
The antidote should inoculate you for now.

870
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:56,583
Alfred, always a pleasure.

871
01:20:56,752 --> 01:20:58,379
Lucius.

872
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:05,553
-You sure you don't want to come in?
-I have to get back.

873
01:21:05,727 --> 01:21:07,457
-I wanted to leave this.
-Thank you.

874
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:08,994
Rachel?

875
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:13,596
Looks like someone's been
burning the candle at both ends.

876
01:21:13,769 --> 01:21:16,465
-Must've been quite an occasion.
-It is my birthday.

877
01:21:16,638 --> 01:21:20,199
I know. I'm sorry I can't come tonight.
I was just dropping off your present.

878
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:23,902
-You've got better plans?
-My boss has been missing for two days...

879
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:27,811
...which means I should probably start
by looking at the bottom of the river.

880
01:21:27,983 --> 01:21:29,473
-Rachel.
-Excuse me.

881
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:33,583
Rachel Dawes.

882
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:37,748
Who authorized that? Get Crane down there
now. Don't take no for an answer.

883
01:21:37,926 --> 01:21:41,863
Call Dr. Lehmann, tell him we need our own
assessment on the judge's desk by morning.

884
01:21:42,264 --> 01:21:44,095
-What's wrong?
-It's Falcone.

885
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:46,757
Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum
on suicide watch.

886
01:21:46,935 --> 01:21:49,927
You're going to Arkham now?
It's in the Narrows, Rachel.

887
01:21:51,206 --> 01:21:53,038
You enjoy your party, Bruce.

888
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:55,939
-Some of us have work to do.
-You be careful.

889
01:21:57,712 --> 01:21:59,305
Happy birthday.

890
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,828
But, Master Wayne,
the guests will be arriving.

891
01:22:21,002 --> 01:22:22,595
Keep them happy until I arrive.

892
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:24,967
Tell them that joke you know.

893
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:05,507
Having fun?

894
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:11,244
Bill? Now, what's a big shot like you
doing in a place like this?

895
01:23:11,419 --> 01:23:12,682
I need some information.

896
01:23:12,854 --> 01:23:17,656
The Wayne Enterprise 47-B, 1-ME.

897
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,519
1-ME.

898
01:23:20,695 --> 01:23:24,359
It's a microwave emitter. It was designed
to vaporize an enemy's water supply.

899
01:23:24,532 --> 01:23:28,765
Rumor was they tested dispersing
water-based chemical agents into the air...

900
01:23:28,937 --> 01:23:30,905
...but isn't that illegal?

901
01:23:32,607 --> 01:23:36,840
I want all the information
on the development of this project...

902
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:41,005
...all data, files, backup disks,
on my desk right away.

903
01:23:41,416 --> 01:23:43,077
Did you lose one?

904
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:47,748
I'm merging your department
with Archives.

905
01:23:48,957 --> 01:23:50,254
And I am firing you.

906
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:54,420
Didn't you get the memo?

907
01:24:01,603 --> 01:24:03,264
Scarecrow.

908
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:08,441
Scarecrow.

909
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:13,111
Scarecrow.

910
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:18,314
Miss Dawes, this is most irregular.

911
01:24:18,486 --> 01:24:21,388
I have nothing to add
to the report I filed with the judge.

912
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:23,820
-I have questions about your report.
-Such as?

913
01:24:23,992 --> 01:24:28,293
Isn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man
who has no history of mental illness...

914
01:24:28,463 --> 01:24:32,058
...to suddenly have a psychotic breakdown
just when he's about to be indicted?

915
01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:36,500
Well, as you can see for yourself, there is
nothing convenient about his symptoms.

916
01:24:41,142 --> 01:24:42,610
-Scarecrow.
-What's "scarecrow"?

917
01:24:43,011 --> 01:24:46,640
Patients suffering delusional episodes
often focus their paranoia...

918
01:24:46,815 --> 01:24:48,908
...on an external tormentor...

919
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:52,281
...usually one conforming
to Jungian archetypes.

920
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:54,921
In this case, a scarecrow.

921
01:24:56,391 --> 01:25:00,521
-He's drugged?
-Psychopharmacology is my primary field.

922
01:25:00,695 --> 01:25:02,095
I'm a strong advocate.

923
01:25:02,998 --> 01:25:05,193
Outside, he was a giant.

924
01:25:05,367 --> 01:25:07,801
In here, only the mind
can grant you power.

925
01:25:07,969 --> 01:25:09,664
You enjoy the reversal.

926
01:25:09,871 --> 01:25:12,898
I respect the mind's power
over the body.

927
01:25:13,074 --> 01:25:14,599
It's why I do what I do.

928
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:19,714
I do what I do to keep thugs like Falcone
behind bars, not in therapy.

929
01:25:19,881 --> 01:25:23,181
I want my own psychiatric consultant
to have full access to Falcone...

930
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:26,651
...including blood work.
Find out what exactly you put him on.

931
01:25:26,821 --> 01:25:29,313
-First thing tomorrow, then.
-Tonight.

932
01:25:29,491 --> 01:25:32,949
I've already paged Dr. Lehmann
at County General.

933
01:25:34,362 --> 01:25:36,160
As you wish.

934
01:25:41,703 --> 01:25:43,637
This way, please.

935
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:46,433
There's something
I think you should see.

936
01:25:57,318 --> 01:25:59,947
This is where we make the medicine.

937
01:26:06,761 --> 01:26:10,664
Perhaps you should have some,
clear your head.

938
01:26:35,924 --> 01:26:37,517
Who knows you're here?

939
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,187
Who knows?

940
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:48,665
He's here.

941
01:26:48,837 --> 01:26:50,099
Who?

942
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:52,206
The Batman.

943
01:26:54,008 --> 01:26:55,943
-What do we do?
-What anyone does...

944
01:26:56,111 --> 01:26:58,875
...when a prowler comes around.

945
01:26:59,814 --> 01:27:02,374
-Call the police.
-You want the cops here?

946
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:05,716
At this point, they can't stop us.

947
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:09,414
But the Batman
has a talent for disruption.

948
01:27:09,591 --> 01:27:12,822
Force him outside,
the police will take him down. Go.

949
01:27:12,994 --> 01:27:15,088
-What about her?
-She hasn't got long.

950
01:27:15,263 --> 01:27:19,996
I gave her a concentrated dose.
The mind can only take so much. Now go.

951
01:27:22,504 --> 01:27:24,802
The things they say about him.

952
01:27:24,973 --> 01:27:26,497
Can he really fly?

953
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:28,734
I heard he can disappear.

954
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:31,936
Well, we'll find out.

955
01:27:32,213 --> 01:27:33,874
Won't we?

956
01:28:21,195 --> 01:28:23,323
Taste of your own medicine, doctor?

957
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:31,871
What have you been doing here?

958
01:28:34,943 --> 01:28:37,343
Who are you working for?

959
01:28:41,783 --> 01:28:44,149
Ra's-- Ra's al Ghul.

960
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:49,188
Ra's al Ghul is dead.
Who are you working for?

961
01:28:49,357 --> 01:28:50,381
Crane.

962
01:28:52,894 --> 01:28:55,829
Dr. Crane isn't here right now.

963
01:28:56,297 --> 01:28:58,288
But if you'd like to make
an appointment....

964
01:29:11,312 --> 01:29:14,214
Batman, put down your weapons
and surrender.

965
01:29:14,949 --> 01:29:16,349
You're surrounded.

966
01:29:21,889 --> 01:29:24,688
-What are you waiting for?
-Backup.

967
01:29:25,426 --> 01:29:27,827
-Backup?
-The Batman's in there.

968
01:29:27,996 --> 01:29:30,157
SWAT's on the way.
But if you wanna go in now...

969
01:29:30,331 --> 01:29:31,856
...I'll be right behind you, sir.

970
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:34,926
SWAT's on the way.

971
01:29:36,004 --> 01:29:37,301
-Hey.
-Hey.

972
01:30:19,781 --> 01:30:21,510
What's happened to her?

973
01:30:24,185 --> 01:30:27,985
Crane poisoned her with a psychotropic
hallucinogen, a panic-inducing toxin.

974
01:30:29,957 --> 01:30:33,724
-Let me get her down to the medics.
-They can't help her, but I can.

975
01:30:37,632 --> 01:30:39,828
Get her downstairs.
Meet me in the alley.

976
01:30:47,775 --> 01:30:50,677
Crane's been smuggling his toxin
hidden in Falcone's drugs...

977
01:30:50,845 --> 01:30:53,007
...and they're dumping it
into the water supply.

978
01:30:53,514 --> 01:30:55,175
-What was he planning?
-I don't know.

979
01:30:55,383 --> 01:30:56,714
Was he working for Falcone?

980
01:30:57,185 --> 01:30:59,711
He mentioned someone else,
someone worse.

981
01:30:59,887 --> 01:31:02,447
She needs the antidote
before the damage is permanent.

982
01:31:02,623 --> 01:31:04,819
-How long does she have?
-Not long.

983
01:31:08,730 --> 01:31:10,527
What is that?

984
01:31:11,899 --> 01:31:14,164
-Backup.
-What the--?

985
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:33,939
Excuse me.

986
01:32:38,686 --> 01:32:41,951
-How is she?
-She's fading. We gotta go.

987
01:32:43,758 --> 01:32:45,226
I'll get my car.

988
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:47,225
I brought mine.

989
01:32:47,595 --> 01:32:49,256
Yours?

990
01:32:58,573 --> 01:33:00,404
I've gotta get me one of those.

991
01:33:01,642 --> 01:33:03,770
-He is in a vehicle.
-Make and color?

992
01:33:03,978 --> 01:33:06,345
It's a black...

993
01:33:07,648 --> 01:33:08,945
...tank.

994
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:12,951
Stay calm.

995
01:33:13,621 --> 01:33:15,419
You've been poisoned.

996
01:33:18,125 --> 01:33:19,457
I'm on him.

997
01:33:27,869 --> 01:33:28,927
Breathe slowly.

998
01:33:39,046 --> 01:33:40,173
Hold on.

999
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:56,028
-What are you doing?
-Shortcut.

1000
01:34:04,505 --> 01:34:06,303
Air One to ground, block that ramp.

1001
01:34:10,878 --> 01:34:12,471
He's got no way off that roof.

1002
01:34:13,881 --> 01:34:16,976
Turn off your engine.
Step away from the car.

1003
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:22,119
-Trust me.
-Weapons system activated.

1004
01:34:40,007 --> 01:34:41,304
Who is this guy?

1005
01:34:41,609 --> 01:34:43,338
-Where's he going?
-He's on the roof.

1006
01:34:57,725 --> 01:34:59,955
-What street is he taking?
-He's not on a street.

1007
01:35:00,127 --> 01:35:01,857
He's flying on rooftops.

1008
01:35:41,035 --> 01:35:43,299
At least tell me what it looks like.

1009
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:47,808
Never mind.

1010
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:53,044
Got him.

1011
01:36:03,924 --> 01:36:05,517
Coming right up on his butt.

1012
01:36:30,217 --> 01:36:32,652
We're tracking suspect vehicle
heading west on l-17.

1013
01:36:37,925 --> 01:36:39,620
-Air One to ground.
-I lost him.

1014
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:41,694
We've lost visual. Exit 9 is blocked.

1015
01:36:41,862 --> 01:36:43,853
We'll loop back to check
the frontage road.

1016
01:36:44,031 --> 01:36:46,125
Stealth mode activated.

1017
01:36:46,767 --> 01:36:48,030
Stay with me.

1018
01:36:54,208 --> 01:36:55,698
What--? There he is.

1019
01:37:15,362 --> 01:37:16,830
Just hold on.

1020
01:37:20,801 --> 01:37:21,996
Rachel!

1021
01:37:54,769 --> 01:37:57,101
-They get any of this crap into the mains?
-Yeah.

1022
01:37:57,304 --> 01:38:00,206
Notify the water company.
There's gotta be a way to isolate it.

1023
01:38:00,374 --> 01:38:03,207
No. They put it all in.
They must've been at this for weeks.

1024
01:38:03,377 --> 01:38:06,972
-Gotham's entire water supply is laced with it.
-Why haven't we felt the effects?

1025
01:38:07,148 --> 01:38:09,446
Must be a compound that has
to be absorbed through the lungs.

1026
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:21,355
How do you feel?

1027
01:38:24,131 --> 01:38:25,599
Where are we?

1028
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:29,900
-Why did you bring me here?
-If I hadn't, your mind would now be lost.

1029
01:38:30,070 --> 01:38:32,130
-You were poisoned.
-It was--

1030
01:38:32,306 --> 01:38:35,901
-It was Dr. Crane.
-Rest. Gordon has Crane.

1031
01:38:36,076 --> 01:38:38,204
Is Sergeant Gordon your friend?

1032
01:38:39,046 --> 01:38:40,707
I don't have the luxury of friends.

1033
01:38:41,582 --> 01:38:44,916
I'm gonna give you a sedative.
You'll wake up back at home.

1034
01:38:45,085 --> 01:38:49,045
When you do, get these to Gordon,
and Gordon alone. Trust no one.

1035
01:38:49,223 --> 01:38:50,952
-What are they?
-The antidote.

1036
01:38:51,125 --> 01:38:54,458
One for Gordon to inoculate himself,
the other for mass production.

1037
01:38:54,862 --> 01:38:56,159
Mass production?

1038
01:38:56,330 --> 01:38:59,493
Crane was just a pawn.
We need to be ready.

1039
01:39:25,426 --> 01:39:28,885
When you told me your grand plan
for saving Gotham...

1040
01:39:29,063 --> 01:39:31,930
...all that stopped me
from calling the men in white coats...

1041
01:39:32,099 --> 01:39:34,568
...was when you said
it wasn't about thrill-seeking.

1042
01:39:34,735 --> 01:39:37,796
-It's not.
-What would you call that?

1043
01:39:39,673 --> 01:39:42,267
-Damn good television.
-It's a miracle no one was killed.

1044
01:39:42,443 --> 01:39:46,209
I didn't have time to observe
the rules of the road, Alfred.

1045
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:49,475
You're getting lost inside
this monster of yours.

1046
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:54,053
I'm using this monster to help other people,
just like my father did.

1047
01:39:54,255 --> 01:39:55,847
For Thomas Wayne, helping others...

1048
01:39:56,023 --> 01:39:58,890
...wasn't about proving anything
to anyone, including himself.

1049
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:02,762
It's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying.

1050
01:40:03,163 --> 01:40:05,723
She's downstairs, sedated.
I need you to take her home.

1051
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:09,693
Well, we both care for Rachel, but
what you're doing has to be beyond that.

1052
01:40:10,004 --> 01:40:12,939
It can't be personal,
or you're just a vigilante.

1053
01:40:13,107 --> 01:40:15,007
-Is Fox still here?
-Yes, sir.

1054
01:40:15,175 --> 01:40:16,768
We need to send these people away.

1055
01:40:16,944 --> 01:40:19,879
Those are Bruce Wayne's guests.
You have a name to maintain.

1056
01:40:20,047 --> 01:40:21,947
I don't care about my name.

1057
01:40:22,116 --> 01:40:25,279
It's not just your name, sir.
It's your father's name.

1058
01:40:27,021 --> 01:40:29,387
And it's all that's left of him.

1059
01:40:31,325 --> 01:40:32,884
Don't destroy it.

1060
01:40:48,208 --> 01:40:50,370
-Mr. Earle.
-Happy birthday, Bruce.

1061
01:40:50,544 --> 01:40:51,978
Thank you.

1062
01:40:52,246 --> 01:40:54,305
How did the stock offering go?

1063
01:40:54,548 --> 01:40:55,777
Prices soared.

1064
01:40:55,950 --> 01:40:57,178
Who was buying?

1065
01:40:57,351 --> 01:40:59,285
All kinds of funds and brokerages.

1066
01:40:59,453 --> 01:41:01,148
It's a bit technical.

1067
01:41:01,322 --> 01:41:03,017
The key thing is...

1068
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:05,215
...our company's future is secure.

1069
01:41:07,094 --> 01:41:08,084
Great.

1070
01:41:21,809 --> 01:41:24,073
A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid.

1071
01:41:29,817 --> 01:41:31,580
What was the plan, Crane?

1072
01:41:31,752 --> 01:41:34,016
How were you gonna get
your toxin into the air?

1073
01:41:34,388 --> 01:41:37,687
Scarecrow. Scarecrow.

1074
01:41:37,858 --> 01:41:39,690
Who were you working for, Crane?

1075
01:41:41,762 --> 01:41:43,958
Oh, it's too late.

1076
01:41:44,565 --> 01:41:46,692
You can't stop it now.

1077
01:41:51,739 --> 01:41:53,263
Here.

1078
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,431
-Happy birthday, Bruce.
-Thank you. Thanks.

1079
01:41:55,609 --> 01:41:58,545
And thank you for that item.

1080
01:42:00,047 --> 01:42:01,276
You're welcome.

1081
01:42:01,448 --> 01:42:04,247
-I know you'll put it to good use.
-I already have.

1082
01:42:04,518 --> 01:42:08,352
How long would it take
to manufacture on a large scale?

1083
01:42:08,889 --> 01:42:09,981
Weeks. Why?

1084
01:42:10,157 --> 01:42:13,320
Somebody's planning to disperse
the toxin using the water supply.

1085
01:42:14,328 --> 01:42:17,423
The water supply won't help you
disperse an inhalant.

1086
01:42:18,365 --> 01:42:19,765
What?

1087
01:42:19,933 --> 01:42:22,425
Unless you have a microwave emitter
powerful enough...

1088
01:42:22,603 --> 01:42:25,538
...to vaporize all the water in the mains.

1089
01:42:25,939 --> 01:42:29,239
A microwave emitter like the one
Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.

1090
01:42:29,643 --> 01:42:30,872
Misplaced?

1091
01:42:31,044 --> 01:42:34,503
Earle just fired me for asking
too many questions about it.

1092
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:40,043
Go back to Wayne Enterprises now
and start making more of that antidote.

1093
01:42:40,220 --> 01:42:43,281
The police are gonna need as much
as they can get their hands on.

1094
01:42:43,457 --> 01:42:45,585
My security clearance has been revoked.

1095
01:42:45,759 --> 01:42:47,750
That wouldn't stop a man like you,
would it?

1096
01:42:48,162 --> 01:42:49,891
I suppose not.

1097
01:42:51,932 --> 01:42:56,597
-Bruce, there's somebody you must meet.
-Not now, Mrs. Delane.

1098
01:42:56,770 --> 01:42:59,637
Now, am I pronouncing this right...

1099
01:42:59,807 --> 01:43:02,276
...Mr. Ra's al Ghul?

1100
01:43:07,881 --> 01:43:09,679
You're not Ra's al Ghul.

1101
01:43:11,218 --> 01:43:12,515
I watched him die.

1102
01:43:12,686 --> 01:43:15,747
But is Ra's al Ghul immortal?

1103
01:43:18,492 --> 01:43:20,961
Are his methods supernatural?

1104
01:43:25,499 --> 01:43:29,902
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal
your true identity, Ra's?

1105
01:43:31,772 --> 01:43:36,266
Surely a man who spends his nights
scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...

1106
01:43:36,443 --> 01:43:38,468
...wouldn't begrudge me dual identities.

1107
01:43:39,313 --> 01:43:41,110
I saved your life.

1108
01:43:41,281 --> 01:43:43,773
I warned you about compassion, Bruce.

1109
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:49,150
Your quarrel is with me.

1110
01:43:50,023 --> 01:43:52,515
You let these people go.

1111
01:43:52,759 --> 01:43:56,059
You are welcome to explain
the situation to them.

1112
01:43:58,332 --> 01:43:59,959
Everyone.

1113
01:44:00,734 --> 01:44:02,634
Everybody?

1114
01:44:05,205 --> 01:44:07,071
l....

1115
01:44:07,541 --> 01:44:11,773
I want to thank you all for coming here
tonight and drinking all of my booze.

1116
01:44:13,881 --> 01:44:15,576
No, really.

1117
01:44:16,617 --> 01:44:19,381
There's a thing about being a Wayne...

1118
01:44:19,553 --> 01:44:23,114
...that you're never short of
a few freeloaders, like yourselves...

1119
01:44:23,290 --> 01:44:26,988
...to fill up your mansion with.
So here's to you people. Thank you.

1120
01:44:27,161 --> 01:44:29,755
-That's enough, Bruce.
-I'm not finished.

1121
01:44:30,097 --> 01:44:31,792
To all of you....

1122
01:44:31,965 --> 01:44:36,368
All of you phonies,
all of you two-faced friends...

1123
01:44:36,537 --> 01:44:41,600
...you sycophantic suck-ups
who smile through your teeth at me...

1124
01:44:41,775 --> 01:44:45,370
...please, leave me in peace.

1125
01:44:45,546 --> 01:44:48,174
Please go.

1126
01:44:48,515 --> 01:44:51,917
Stop smiling, it's not a joke.
Please leave.

1127
01:44:52,085 --> 01:44:54,281
The party's over, get out.

1128
01:44:54,454 --> 01:44:57,720
The apple has fallen very far
from the tree, Mr. Wayne.

1129
01:45:02,563 --> 01:45:04,827
He's turning into a jerk.

1130
01:45:11,138 --> 01:45:12,901
Amusing.

1131
01:45:13,206 --> 01:45:16,643
But pointless.
None of these people have long to live.

1132
01:45:16,810 --> 01:45:20,303
Your antics at the asylum
have forced my hand.

1133
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:22,642
So Crane was working for you.

1134
01:45:22,816 --> 01:45:26,650
His toxin is derived from the organic
compound found in our blue flowers.

1135
01:45:26,987 --> 01:45:29,046
He was able to weaponize it.

1136
01:45:29,223 --> 01:45:31,191
He's not a member of
the League of Shadows?

1137
01:45:31,358 --> 01:45:35,920
Of course not. He thought our plan
was to hold the city to ransom.

1138
01:45:36,630 --> 01:45:41,158
But really, you are gonna release
Crane's poison on the entire city.

1139
01:45:41,335 --> 01:45:45,362
Then watch Gotham tear itself apart
through fear.

1140
01:45:58,251 --> 01:46:00,152
You're gonna destroy millions of lives.

1141
01:46:00,354 --> 01:46:03,687
Only a cynical man would call
what these people have "lives," Wayne.

1142
01:46:03,857 --> 01:46:05,689
Crime. Despair.

1143
01:46:05,859 --> 01:46:07,953
This is not how man
was supposed to live.

1144
01:46:08,595 --> 01:46:11,724
The League of Shadows has been
a check against human corruption...

1145
01:46:11,898 --> 01:46:13,389
...for thousands of years.

1146
01:46:13,567 --> 01:46:17,162
We sacked Rome.
Loaded trade ships with plague rats.

1147
01:46:17,337 --> 01:46:18,737
Burned London to the ground.

1148
01:46:18,905 --> 01:46:21,739
Every time a civilization reaches
the pinnacle of its decadence...

1149
01:46:21,908 --> 01:46:23,877
...we return to restore the balance.

1150
01:46:24,044 --> 01:46:25,637
Gotham isn't beyond saving.

1151
01:46:26,947 --> 01:46:29,643
Give me more time.
There are good people here.

1152
01:46:29,816 --> 01:46:34,982
You are defending a city so corrupt we have
infiltrated every level of its infrastructure.

1153
01:46:46,066 --> 01:46:47,465
Time to play.

1154
01:46:51,638 --> 01:46:54,301
When I found you in that jail,
you were lost.

1155
01:46:54,474 --> 01:46:56,568
But I believed in you.

1156
01:46:56,743 --> 01:47:00,509
I took away your fear,
and I showed you a path.

1157
01:47:00,747 --> 01:47:03,011
You were my greatest student.

1158
01:47:03,283 --> 01:47:06,446
It should be you standing by my side,
saving the world.

1159
01:47:07,254 --> 01:47:09,882
I'll be standing where I belong.

1160
01:47:10,524 --> 01:47:13,653
Between you and the people of Gotham.

1161
01:47:15,329 --> 01:47:17,923
No one can save Gotham.

1162
01:47:21,268 --> 01:47:25,933
When a forest grows too wild,
a purging fire is inevitable and natural.

1163
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:31,805
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror
as its greatest city destroys itself.

1164
01:47:32,379 --> 01:47:35,610
The movement back to harmony
will be unstoppable this time.

1165
01:47:35,916 --> 01:47:38,112
-You attacked Gotham before?
-Of course.

1166
01:47:38,351 --> 01:47:40,980
Over the ages our weapons
have grown more sophisticated.

1167
01:47:41,154 --> 01:47:44,056
With Gotham we tried a new one.
Economics.

1168
01:47:44,458 --> 01:47:49,157
But we underestimated certain
of Gotham's citizens...

1169
01:47:49,596 --> 01:47:51,792
...such as your parents.

1170
01:47:55,869 --> 01:47:59,328
Gunned down by one of the very people
they were trying to help.

1171
01:47:59,606 --> 01:48:02,405
Create enough hunger
and everyone becomes a criminal.

1172
01:48:02,576 --> 01:48:05,045
Their deaths galvanized the city
into saving itself...

1173
01:48:05,212 --> 01:48:07,908
...and Gotham has limped on ever since.

1174
01:48:08,081 --> 01:48:09,845
We are back to finish the job.

1175
01:48:10,584 --> 01:48:13,815
And this time no misguided idealists
will get in the way.

1176
01:48:13,987 --> 01:48:17,582
Like your father, you lack the courage
to do all that is necessary.

1177
01:48:17,858 --> 01:48:20,759
If someone stands in the way
of true justice...

1178
01:48:20,927 --> 01:48:24,989
...you simply walk up behind them
and stab them in the heart.

1179
01:48:30,003 --> 01:48:32,165
-I am gonna stop you.
-You never did learn...

1180
01:48:32,339 --> 01:48:34,364
...to mind your surroundings.

1181
01:48:36,576 --> 01:48:38,567
Justice is balance.

1182
01:48:38,745 --> 01:48:40,907
You burned my house
and left me for dead.

1183
01:48:43,583 --> 01:48:45,711
Consider us even.

1184
01:49:02,135 --> 01:49:03,865
No one comes out. Make sure.

1185
01:49:13,747 --> 01:49:15,215
They're all gone?

1186
01:49:15,382 --> 01:49:18,147
-How many from maximum security?
-Every one of them.

1187
01:49:18,318 --> 01:49:20,082
Serial killers, rapists.

1188
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:23,153
Raise the bridges.
We don't want any getting off the island.

1189
01:49:23,323 --> 01:49:24,757
Yeah, I'll raise the bridges...

1190
01:49:24,925 --> 01:49:29,191
...when I get every available unit out here
to catch the homicidal maniacs...

1191
01:49:29,362 --> 01:49:32,264
-...that are running loose out there.
-Come on!

1192
01:49:55,422 --> 01:49:58,187
I hope you're not a member
of the fire brigade.

1193
01:50:04,197 --> 01:50:06,291
Master Wayne! Master Wayne!

1194
01:50:10,837 --> 01:50:15,206
What is the point of all those pushups
if you can't even lift a bloody log?

1195
01:50:53,647 --> 01:50:55,740
What have I done, Alfred?

1196
01:50:56,750 --> 01:50:58,684
Everything my family...

1197
01:50:58,852 --> 01:51:00,786
...my father, built....

1198
01:51:03,156 --> 01:51:07,093
The Wayne legacy is more
than bricks and mortar, sir.

1199
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:09,490
I wanted to save Gotham.

1200
01:51:10,330 --> 01:51:12,230
I failed.

1201
01:51:13,433 --> 01:51:14,730
Why do we fall, sir?

1202
01:51:17,904 --> 01:51:21,363
So that we can learn
to pick ourselves up.

1203
01:51:23,843 --> 01:51:26,005
You still haven't given up on me?

1204
01:51:27,914 --> 01:51:29,405
Never.

1205
01:51:30,450 --> 01:51:31,781
Down!

1206
01:51:31,952 --> 01:51:34,887
Harassment! I see harassment!

1207
01:51:35,055 --> 01:51:37,080
Maybe you'd like to see
some excessive force?

1208
01:51:37,257 --> 01:51:39,191
Madman with a gun.

1209
01:51:40,427 --> 01:51:43,794
With residents furious at the
unprecedented show of police strength...

1210
01:51:43,964 --> 01:51:47,297
-...to round up the inmates....
-We're about to raise these bridges.

1211
01:51:47,467 --> 01:51:51,062
Officer, I am a Gotham City
district attorney. Let me pass.

1212
01:51:58,478 --> 01:52:00,776
-Just shut up!
-Hey, Flass, cool it!

1213
01:52:00,947 --> 01:52:02,210
Hold these people back.

1214
01:52:02,382 --> 01:52:05,374
Hey, Gordon. Somebody here to see you.

1215
01:52:05,552 --> 01:52:07,918
-What are you doing here?
-Our friend sent me with this.

1216
01:52:08,088 --> 01:52:09,612
It counteracts Crane's toxin.

1217
01:52:09,789 --> 01:52:11,257
Hopefully you won't need it.

1218
01:52:11,424 --> 01:52:14,587
Not unless he's got some way
of getting that crap into the air.

1219
01:52:15,729 --> 01:52:18,198
All right, last one across.

1220
01:52:18,865 --> 01:52:22,802
Come on, people, they want this bridge up
in no more than three minutes!

1221
01:52:23,003 --> 01:52:26,404
Better get you off the island before
they raise the bridges. Patrolman!

1222
01:52:27,007 --> 01:52:27,996
Go!

1223
01:52:54,834 --> 01:52:56,666
I can't find my mom.

1224
01:52:56,970 --> 01:52:58,494
Hey!

1225
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:08,609
What the hell are you doing?

1226
01:53:10,116 --> 01:53:11,709
Gentlemen...

1227
01:53:12,118 --> 01:53:14,678
...time to spread the word.

1228
01:53:16,389 --> 01:53:17,789
And the word is...

1229
01:53:19,059 --> 01:53:20,788
...panic.

1230
01:53:44,884 --> 01:53:46,477
Jesus. The pressure, it's spiking.

1231
01:53:47,487 --> 01:53:48,818
Right there.

1232
01:53:49,122 --> 01:53:51,386
That water main
is right under the Narrows.

1233
01:54:08,308 --> 01:54:09,866
It's okay.

1234
01:54:42,709 --> 01:54:44,268
This is Commissioner Loeb.

1235
01:54:44,444 --> 01:54:46,139
Come on, somebody talk to me.

1236
01:54:46,312 --> 01:54:47,780
Come on!

1237
01:55:07,433 --> 01:55:09,493
Loeb, Loeb. This is Gordon.

1238
01:55:09,769 --> 01:55:11,134
What the hell is going on?

1239
01:55:11,304 --> 01:55:14,740
We need reinforcements.
TAC teams, SWAT, riot cops!

1240
01:55:14,908 --> 01:55:19,140
Gordon! All the city's riot police
are on the island with you!

1241
01:55:19,312 --> 01:55:21,337
Well, they're completely incapacitated!

1242
01:55:21,648 --> 01:55:25,607
It's okay, it's okay.
No one's gonna hurt you.

1243
01:55:26,486 --> 01:55:28,113
Of course they are!

1244
01:55:28,321 --> 01:55:31,291
-Crane?
-No. Scarecrow.

1245
01:55:33,059 --> 01:55:34,459
Gordon...

1246
01:55:34,627 --> 01:55:36,891
...there's nobody left to send in.

1247
01:55:38,431 --> 01:55:40,126
So I'm on my own?

1248
01:55:44,237 --> 01:55:45,898
The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces.

1249
01:55:46,072 --> 01:55:48,666
This is just the beginning.
If they hit the whole city...

1250
01:55:48,841 --> 01:55:51,572
...there's nothing to stop Gotham
tearing itself apart.

1251
01:55:51,744 --> 01:55:53,644
-How are they gonna do that?
-The train.

1252
01:55:53,813 --> 01:55:57,647
The monorail follows the water mains
to the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.

1253
01:55:57,817 --> 01:55:59,547
If the machine gets to the station...

1254
01:55:59,719 --> 01:56:03,178
...it'll cause a chain reaction
that'll vaporize the city's water supply.

1255
01:56:03,356 --> 01:56:04,949
Covering Gotham in this poison.

1256
01:56:05,124 --> 01:56:08,322
I'm gonna stop him from loading
that train, but I may need your help.

1257
01:56:08,494 --> 01:56:10,292
-What do you need?
-Can you drive stick?

1258
01:56:16,569 --> 01:56:18,230
There you are!

1259
01:56:18,404 --> 01:56:20,395
There is nothing to fear...

1260
01:56:20,573 --> 01:56:22,303
...but fear itself!

1261
01:56:23,376 --> 01:56:25,708
I am here to help!

1262
01:56:56,909 --> 01:56:59,071
Batman will save us. He'll come.

1263
01:57:04,284 --> 01:57:06,184
-He'll come.
-Don't peek.

1264
01:57:14,827 --> 01:57:18,195
This is Gordon.
Prepare to lower the bridge.

1265
01:57:24,070 --> 01:57:26,198
I told you he'd come.

1266
01:57:31,210 --> 01:57:32,837
Wait.

1267
01:57:33,813 --> 01:57:35,406
You could die.

1268
01:57:35,581 --> 01:57:36,879
At least tell me your name.

1269
01:57:42,288 --> 01:57:44,484
It's not who I am underneath...

1270
01:57:45,458 --> 01:57:49,258
...but what I do that defines me.

1271
01:57:50,129 --> 01:57:51,426
Bruce?

1272
01:58:25,131 --> 01:58:28,499
Well, well. You took my advice
about theatricality a bit literally.

1273
01:58:28,668 --> 01:58:31,137
-It ends here.
-For you and the police, maybe.

1274
01:58:31,304 --> 01:58:33,636
My fight, however,
lies with the rest of Gotham.

1275
01:58:33,806 --> 01:58:37,174
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a city to destroy.

1276
01:58:37,343 --> 01:58:41,041
-I can't beat two of your pawns?
-As you wish.

1277
01:58:53,860 --> 01:58:56,158
GPS online.

1278
01:59:03,002 --> 01:59:05,232
In 1·· yards.

1279
01:59:36,102 --> 01:59:37,399
Gentlemen.

1280
02:00:04,797 --> 02:00:07,027
Who the hell authorized this?

1281
02:00:17,577 --> 02:00:19,670
Distance to Wayne Tower, three miles.

1282
02:00:26,919 --> 02:00:29,548
The pressure's moving along the mains,
blowing the pipes.

1283
02:00:29,722 --> 02:00:31,087
If that pressure reaches us...

1284
02:00:31,257 --> 02:00:34,283
...the water supply right across
the whole city is gonna blow!

1285
02:00:44,737 --> 02:00:47,638
At the next intersection, turn right.

1286
02:01:12,331 --> 02:01:13,765
You will never learn.

1287
02:01:21,374 --> 02:01:22,364
Sorry.

1288
02:01:26,345 --> 02:01:29,315
-Familiar. Don't you have anything new?
-How about this?!

1289
02:01:46,098 --> 02:01:48,397
You have arrived at Wayne Tower.

1290
02:02:01,681 --> 02:02:02,944
Evacuate the building.

1291
02:02:03,149 --> 02:02:05,641
We're on top of the main hub
and it's gonna blow.

1292
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:16,756
Weapons system activated.

1293
02:02:20,833 --> 02:02:21,823
Nice ride.

1294
02:02:37,116 --> 02:02:38,106
Armed.

1295
02:02:50,062 --> 02:02:51,530
Don't be afraid, Bruce.

1296
02:02:54,333 --> 02:02:55,699
Come on. Come on.

1297
02:03:00,473 --> 02:03:02,532
You are just an ordinary man in a cape.

1298
02:03:02,708 --> 02:03:06,577
That's why you couldn't fight injustice,
that's why you can't stop this train.

1299
02:03:06,746 --> 02:03:09,340
Who said anything about stopping it?

1300
02:03:15,154 --> 02:03:16,679
Yes!

1301
02:03:24,864 --> 02:03:28,300
You never learned
to mind your surroundings!

1302
02:03:36,108 --> 02:03:38,600
Have you finally learned to do
what is necessary?

1303
02:03:38,911 --> 02:03:41,209
I won't kill you...

1304
02:03:45,651 --> 02:03:47,813
...but I don't have to save you.

1305
02:05:02,962 --> 02:05:06,022
-The meeting's already started.
-What meeting?

1306
02:05:10,302 --> 02:05:13,204
Fox, I seem to remember firing you.

1307
02:05:13,739 --> 02:05:15,298
You did.

1308
02:05:15,474 --> 02:05:17,568
I got another job.

1309
02:05:18,410 --> 02:05:19,844
Yours.

1310
02:05:20,312 --> 02:05:22,008
On whose authority?

1311
02:05:22,648 --> 02:05:24,582
Batman may have made the front page...

1312
02:05:24,784 --> 02:05:27,685
...but Bruce Wayne
got pushed to page eight.

1313
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:35,550
Bruce Wayne.

1314
02:05:35,728 --> 02:05:39,494
What makes you think you can decide
who's running Wayne Enterprises?

1315
02:05:39,665 --> 02:05:42,396
-The fact that I'm the owner.
-What are you talking about?

1316
02:05:42,668 --> 02:05:44,568
The company went public a week ago.

1317
02:05:44,737 --> 02:05:46,205
And I bought most of the shares.

1318
02:05:46,572 --> 02:05:50,031
Through various charitable foundations
and trusts and so forth.

1319
02:05:50,209 --> 02:05:53,406
Look, it's all a bit technical,
but the important thing...

1320
02:05:53,646 --> 02:05:56,945
...is that my company's future is secure.

1321
02:05:57,316 --> 02:05:58,715
Right, Mr. Fox?

1322
02:05:58,884 --> 02:06:00,716
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.

1323
02:06:02,922 --> 02:06:04,515
Didn't you get the memo?

1324
02:06:23,442 --> 02:06:26,639
-I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Rachel.
-No. No, Bruce...

1325
02:06:26,846 --> 02:06:28,211
...I'm sorry.

1326
02:06:29,081 --> 02:06:31,744
The day that Chill died, l....

1327
02:06:33,619 --> 02:06:35,246
I said terrible things.

1328
02:06:35,754 --> 02:06:37,518
But true things.

1329
02:06:38,157 --> 02:06:39,989
I was a coward with a gun...

1330
02:06:40,159 --> 02:06:43,925
...and justice is about more than revenge,
so thank you.

1331
02:06:44,997 --> 02:06:47,659
I never stopped thinking about you.

1332
02:06:49,134 --> 02:06:50,761
About us.

1333
02:06:51,403 --> 02:06:53,372
And when I heard you were back, l....

1334
02:06:54,206 --> 02:06:56,402
I started to hope.

1335
02:07:20,466 --> 02:07:23,162
But then I found out about your mask.

1336
02:07:24,370 --> 02:07:27,169
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.

1337
02:07:27,806 --> 02:07:29,468
No. This...

1338
02:07:30,643 --> 02:07:32,338
...is your mask.

1339
02:07:34,313 --> 02:07:37,874
Your real face is the one
that criminals now fear.

1340
02:07:38,717 --> 02:07:40,686
The man I loved...

1341
02:07:41,420 --> 02:07:42,854
...the man who vanished...

1342
02:07:44,089 --> 02:07:46,217
...he never came back at all.

1343
02:07:50,729 --> 02:07:53,358
But maybe he's still
out there somewhere.

1344
02:07:55,568 --> 02:07:59,231
Maybe someday,
when Gotham no longer needs Batman...

1345
02:08:00,306 --> 02:08:02,274
...I'll see him again.

1346
02:08:13,319 --> 02:08:16,220
-Proved me wrong, you know.
-About what?

1347
02:08:19,058 --> 02:08:21,527
Your father would be very proud of you.

1348
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:23,353
Just like me.

1349
02:08:50,356 --> 02:08:52,222
What will you do?

1350
02:08:53,625 --> 02:08:55,184
Rebuild it.

1351
02:08:56,061 --> 02:08:58,428
Just the way it was, brick for brick.

1352
02:09:05,270 --> 02:09:06,533
Just the way it was, sir?

1353
02:09:08,640 --> 02:09:09,869
Yeah, why?

1354
02:09:10,042 --> 02:09:12,875
I thought this might be
a good opportunity for...

1355
02:09:13,045 --> 02:09:15,514
...improving the foundations.

1356
02:09:15,681 --> 02:09:18,650
-In the southeast corner?
-Precisely, sir.

1357
02:09:34,333 --> 02:09:37,166
-Nice.
-I couldn't find any mob bosses.

1358
02:09:38,103 --> 02:09:40,834
-Well, sergeant?
-It's "lieutenant" now.

1359
02:09:41,173 --> 02:09:42,663
You really started something.

1360
02:09:42,875 --> 02:09:44,843
Bent cops running scared.

1361
02:09:45,010 --> 02:09:46,444
Hope on the streets.

1362
02:09:46,679 --> 02:09:50,274
-But?
-The Narrows is lost.

1363
02:09:50,816 --> 02:09:54,684
And we still haven't picked up Crane
or half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.

1364
02:09:55,320 --> 02:09:56,947
We will.

1365
02:09:57,189 --> 02:09:58,850
We can bring Gotham back.

1366
02:09:59,024 --> 02:10:01,516
-What about escalation?
-Escalation?

1367
02:10:01,694 --> 02:10:05,994
We start carrying semiautomatics,
they buy automatics.

1368
02:10:06,165 --> 02:10:10,534
We start wearing Kevlar,
they buy armor-piercing rounds.

1369
02:10:10,702 --> 02:10:13,968
-And?
-And you're wearing a mask...

1370
02:10:14,406 --> 02:10:16,340
...and jumping off rooftops.

1371
02:10:17,709 --> 02:10:19,735
Now, take this guy.

1372
02:10:19,978 --> 02:10:22,038
Armed robbery, double homicide.

1373
02:10:22,214 --> 02:10:25,445
Got a taste for the theatrical, like you.

1374
02:10:25,717 --> 02:10:27,652
Leaves a calling card.

1375
02:10:33,525 --> 02:10:35,357
I'll look into it.

1376
02:10:38,831 --> 02:10:40,355
I never said thank you.

1377
02:10:45,404 --> 02:10:47,463
And you'll never have to.

1378
02:19:59,257 --> 02:20:01,248
