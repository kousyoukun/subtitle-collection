1
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:51,473
Rachel, let me see.

2
00:00:57,516 --> 00:01:00,644
-Can l see?
-Finders keepers. And l found it.

3
00:01:00,819 --> 00:01:02,343
ln my garden.

4
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:05,887
Finders keepers.

5
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:14,356
Bruce?

6
00:01:19,373 --> 00:01:21,103
Bruce?

7
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:25,880
Mom! Mr. Alfred!

8
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:51,001
Did you have dream?

9
00:01:51,477 --> 00:01:53,342
Nightmare.

10
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:59,185
Worse than this place?

11
00:02:21,245 --> 00:02:23,145
They are going to fight you.

12
00:02:23,547 --> 00:02:25,175
-Again?
-Until they kill you.

13
00:02:27,385 --> 00:02:29,183
Can they kill me before breakfast?

14
00:02:31,556 --> 00:02:34,390
You are in hell, little man.

15
00:02:37,663 --> 00:02:40,462
And l am the devil.

16
00:02:43,837 --> 00:02:45,305
You're not the devil.

17
00:02:45,472 --> 00:02:46,839
You're practice.

18
00:03:30,324 --> 00:03:31,621
Solitary.

19
00:03:31,793 --> 00:03:33,694
-Why?
-For protection.

20
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,727
-l don't need protection.
-Protection for them.

21
00:03:40,402 --> 00:03:42,393
Get in.

22
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:48,436
Are you so desperate
to fight criminals...

23
00:03:48,612 --> 00:03:51,240
...that you lock yourself in
to take them on one at a time?

24
00:03:52,516 --> 00:03:56,419
Actually, there were seven of them.

25
00:03:56,588 --> 00:03:58,886
l counted six, Mr. Wayne.

26
00:04:02,661 --> 00:04:03,890
How do you know my name?

27
00:04:04,063 --> 00:04:07,124
The world is too small for someone
like Bruce Wayne to disappear...

28
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,633
...no matter how deep
he chooses to sink.

29
00:04:09,803 --> 00:04:10,929
Who are you?

30
00:04:11,105 --> 00:04:14,268
My name is merely Ducard,
but l speak for Ra's al Ghul...

31
00:04:14,442 --> 00:04:18,071
...a man greatly feared
by the criminal underworld.

32
00:04:18,246 --> 00:04:19,838
A man who can offer you a path.

33
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,241
What makes you think l need a path?

34
00:04:23,652 --> 00:04:26,247
Someone like you is only here by choice.

35
00:04:26,422 --> 00:04:28,788
You have been exploring
the criminal fraternity...

36
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,427
...but whatever your original intentions...

37
00:04:32,162 --> 00:04:35,496
...you have become truly lost.

38
00:04:37,034 --> 00:04:40,800
And what path can Ra's al Ghul offer?

39
00:04:40,972 --> 00:04:44,966
The path of a man
who shares his hatred of evil...

40
00:04:45,145 --> 00:04:48,375
...and wishes to serve true justice.

41
00:04:48,848 --> 00:04:50,941
The path of the League of Shadows.

42
00:04:54,054 --> 00:04:56,318
-You're vigilantes.
-No, no, no.

43
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,689
A vigilante is just a man lost
in the scramble for his own gratification.

44
00:05:00,862 --> 00:05:04,525
He can be destroyed or locked up.

45
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:10,704
But if you make yourself more
than just a man...

46
00:05:10,873 --> 00:05:13,842
...if you devote yourself to an ideal...

47
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,502
...and if they can't stop you...

48
00:05:16,914 --> 00:05:19,349
...then you become
something else entirely.

49
00:05:21,052 --> 00:05:22,576
Which is?

50
00:05:23,087 --> 00:05:26,056
Legend, Mr. Wayne.

51
00:05:27,392 --> 00:05:28,985
Tomorrow, you will be released.

52
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:32,563
lf you are bored of brawling with thieves
and want to achieve something...

53
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:36,190
...there is a rare blue flower
that grows on the eastern slopes.

54
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,064
Pick one of these flowers.

55
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:41,208
lf you can carry it
to the top of the mountain...

56
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:44,173
...you may find what you were looking for
in the first place.

57
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:47,178
And what was l looking for?

58
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:50,851
Only you can know that.

59
00:06:58,063 --> 00:07:01,625
You turn back. You go back.

60
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:11,269
Ra's al Ghul?

61
00:08:21,494 --> 00:08:23,052
Wait.

62
00:08:26,065 --> 00:08:27,362
What are you seeking?

63
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,291
l seek...

64
00:08:31,838 --> 00:08:34,102
...the means to fight injustice.

65
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:36,567
To turn fear...

66
00:08:36,944 --> 00:08:39,777
...against those
who prey on the fearful.

67
00:09:01,472 --> 00:09:04,533
To manipulate the fears in others...

68
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:08,814
...you must first master your own.

69
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,145
Are you ready to begin?

70
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,611
l can.... l can barely stand.

71
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:17,154
Death does not wait for you to be ready!

72
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:20,452
Death is not considerate or fair!

73
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:25,591
And make no mistake,
here you face death.

74
00:09:29,472 --> 00:09:30,837
Tiger.

75
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:34,238
Jujitsu.

76
00:09:36,446 --> 00:09:37,504
Panther.

77
00:09:41,017 --> 00:09:43,316
You're skilled. But this is not a dance.

78
00:09:48,793 --> 00:09:50,352
And you are afraid.

79
00:09:53,298 --> 00:09:55,163
But not of me.

80
00:09:58,638 --> 00:10:01,129
Tell us, Mr. Wayne...

81
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,810
...what do you fear?

82
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,393
Bruce?

83
00:10:22,031 --> 00:10:24,523
lt's okay. lt's okay.

84
00:10:24,701 --> 00:10:26,191
You'll be okay.

85
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,768
Will we be needing an ambulance,
Master Wayne?

86
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:31,932
No, l'll set the bone
and take him for an x-ray later.

87
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,338
Very good, sir.

88
00:10:33,812 --> 00:10:37,509
-l'm very sorry, sir. l've told--
-Don't worry. lt's fine.

89
00:10:39,852 --> 00:10:41,821
Took quite a fall, didn't we, Master Bruce?

90
00:10:41,988 --> 00:10:43,250
And why do we fall, Bruce?

91
00:10:43,557 --> 00:10:46,651
So we can learn to pick ourselves up.

92
00:10:50,464 --> 00:10:53,298
Just a little fall. lt's just a small fracture.

93
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:04,075
The bats again?

94
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,378
You know why they attacked you,
don't you?

95
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:12,947
-They were afraid of you.
-Afraid of me?

96
00:11:13,124 --> 00:11:15,091
All creatures feel fear.

97
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:16,624
Even the scary ones?

98
00:11:16,794 --> 00:11:18,660
Especially the scary ones.

99
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,827
l got something to show you.

100
00:11:25,137 --> 00:11:28,437
-You think your mother will like them?
-Yeah.

101
00:11:29,109 --> 00:11:31,304
-l think it's time to get up.
-Maybe.

102
00:11:31,478 --> 00:11:33,070
No going back to bed.

103
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:38,410
Did you build this train, Dad?

104
00:11:38,586 --> 00:11:43,286
Gotham's been good to our family,
but the city's been suffering.

105
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,986
People less fortunate than us
have been enduring very hard times.

106
00:11:47,163 --> 00:11:51,100
So we built a new, cheap, public
transportation system to unite the city.

107
00:11:51,268 --> 00:11:52,963
And at the center...

108
00:11:53,136 --> 00:11:54,968
...Wayne Tower.

109
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:58,040
-ls that where you work?
-No, l work at the hospital.

110
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:01,406
l leave the running of our company
to much better men.

111
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:03,445
-Better?
-Well...

112
00:12:03,615 --> 00:12:05,879
...more interested men.

113
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:03,682
Can we go?

114
00:13:06,054 --> 00:13:07,544
Please.

115
00:13:08,156 --> 00:13:10,181
Okay. Let's go.

116
00:13:19,436 --> 00:13:22,304
-What's wrong, Bruce?
-No, no. lt was me.

117
00:13:22,473 --> 00:13:24,567
l just needed some fresh air.

118
00:13:24,743 --> 00:13:27,940
A little bit of opera goes a long way.
Right, Bruce?

119
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:33,279
Come on. Let's go.

120
00:13:38,724 --> 00:13:40,488
Wallets, jewelry. Come on, fast.

121
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,025
-That's fine.
-Fast.

122
00:13:42,195 --> 00:13:43,753
Take it easy.

123
00:13:44,464 --> 00:13:45,989
Take it easy.

124
00:13:46,768 --> 00:13:48,235
Here you go.

125
00:13:51,005 --> 00:13:53,839
lt's fine. lt's fine.

126
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,838
Now just take it and go.

127
00:13:58,013 --> 00:13:59,810
-l said, jewelry.
-Hey--

128
00:14:01,851 --> 00:14:03,182
Thomas!

129
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:12,788
Bruce.

130
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:16,833
lt's okay.

131
00:14:19,972 --> 00:14:21,701
Don't be afraid.

132
00:14:53,544 --> 00:14:55,307
ls this your father's?

133
00:14:56,849 --> 00:14:58,975
lt's okay.

134
00:15:00,185 --> 00:15:01,812
Come here.

135
00:15:04,557 --> 00:15:06,752
There you go.

136
00:15:09,864 --> 00:15:11,889
lt's okay.

137
00:15:13,634 --> 00:15:15,534
lt's okay.

138
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,031
Gordon.

139
00:15:29,152 --> 00:15:30,710
Hey.

140
00:15:31,354 --> 00:15:32,583
Good news.

141
00:15:34,024 --> 00:15:35,924
We got him, son.

142
00:15:56,551 --> 00:15:58,280
You're in excellent hands.

143
00:15:58,452 --> 00:16:00,283
We'll be watching the empire.

144
00:16:00,454 --> 00:16:03,446
When you grow up,
it'll be waiting for you.

145
00:16:19,476 --> 00:16:22,570
l thought l might prepare a little supper.

146
00:16:27,752 --> 00:16:29,812
-Very well.
-Alfred?

147
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,819
-Yes, Master Bruce?
-lt was my fault, Alfred.

148
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,657
-l made them leave the theater.
-No.

149
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,857
-lf l hadn't gotten scared....
-lt was nothing that you did.

150
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:45,336
lt was him, and him alone.

151
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,307
Do you understand?

152
00:16:50,445 --> 00:16:53,506
l miss them, Alfred.
l miss them so much.

153
00:16:53,682 --> 00:16:55,650
So do l, Master Bruce.

154
00:16:58,088 --> 00:16:59,316
So do l.

155
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:04,428
And do you still feel responsible
for your parents' death?

156
00:17:04,595 --> 00:17:06,722
My anger outweighs my guilt.

157
00:17:07,465 --> 00:17:08,864
Come.

158
00:17:13,538 --> 00:17:16,234
You have learned to bury
your guilt with anger.

159
00:17:16,408 --> 00:17:19,435
l will teach you to confront it
and to face the truth.

160
00:17:21,948 --> 00:17:26,909
You know how to fight six men.
We can teach you how to engage 600.

161
00:17:28,155 --> 00:17:32,388
You know how to disappear.
We can teach you to become truly invisible.

162
00:17:34,062 --> 00:17:35,758
lnvisible?

163
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:44,400
The ninja understands that invisibility
is a matter of patience and agility.

164
00:17:57,356 --> 00:17:59,085
Always mind your surroundings.

165
00:18:02,261 --> 00:18:04,458
Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.

166
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:08,195
-As weapons?
-Or distractions.

167
00:18:08,368 --> 00:18:10,701
Theatricality and deception
are powerful agents.

168
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:14,199
You must become more than just a man
in the mind of your opponent.

169
00:18:16,511 --> 00:18:18,638
-Who is he?
-He was a farmer.

170
00:18:18,815 --> 00:18:22,045
Then he tried to take his neighbor's land
and became a murderer.

171
00:18:22,218 --> 00:18:24,516
-Now he is a prisoner.
-What'll happen to him?

172
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,121
Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated.

173
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:31,227
Criminals thrive on the indulgence
of society's understanding.

174
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:38,099
Your parents' death was not your fault.

175
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,707
lt was your father's.

176
00:19:08,604 --> 00:19:11,438
Anger does not change the fact
that your father failed to act.

177
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,804
-The man had a gun.
-Would that stop you?

178
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,840
l've had training.

179
00:19:16,013 --> 00:19:17,844
The training is nothing!

180
00:19:18,015 --> 00:19:19,676
Will is everything!

181
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:27,288
The will to act.

182
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,298
Yield.

183
00:19:38,605 --> 00:19:40,005
You haven't beaten me.

184
00:19:40,175 --> 00:19:42,905
You have sacrificed sure footing
for a killing stroke.

185
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:52,316
Rub your chest.

186
00:19:52,823 --> 00:19:55,690
Your arms will take care of themselves.

187
00:19:58,362 --> 00:19:59,988
You are stronger than your father.

188
00:20:00,664 --> 00:20:02,292
You didn't know my father.

189
00:20:02,466 --> 00:20:04,765
But l know the rage that drives you.

190
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:09,966
That impossible anger strangling the grief,
until the memory of your loved one is just...

191
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,201
...poison in your veins.

192
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:16,838
And one day, you catch yourself wishing
the person you loved had never existed...

193
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:20,719
...so you'd be spared your pain.

194
00:20:23,757 --> 00:20:27,125
l wasn't always here in the mountains.

195
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,790
Once, l had a wife.

196
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:33,668
My great love.

197
00:20:34,837 --> 00:20:36,964
She was taken from me.

198
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,337
Like you, l was forced to learn
there are those without decency...

199
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:43,810
...who must be fought without hesitation,
without pity.

200
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,949
Your anger gives you great power.

201
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:51,981
But if you let it, it will destroy you...

202
00:20:52,524 --> 00:20:54,389
...as it almost did me.

203
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,425
-What stopped it?
-Vengeance.

204
00:20:57,496 --> 00:20:59,431
That's no help to me.

205
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,464
Why, Bruce?

206
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,298
Why could you not avenge your parents?

207
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:11,568
Will you be heading back to Princeton
after the hearing, sir...

208
00:21:11,746 --> 00:21:14,408
...or can l persuade you to stay on
for a day or two?

209
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,813
l'm not heading back at all.

210
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:19,011
-You don't like it there?
-l like it fine.

211
00:21:19,422 --> 00:21:22,221
They just don't feel the same way.

212
00:21:23,027 --> 00:21:26,690
-l've prepared the master bedroom.
-No.

213
00:21:26,863 --> 00:21:28,263
My room will be fine.

214
00:21:28,432 --> 00:21:30,958
With all due respect, sir,
Wayne Manor is your house.

215
00:21:31,135 --> 00:21:33,001
No, Alfred, it's my father's house.

216
00:21:33,171 --> 00:21:35,662
-Your father is dead.
-This place is a mausoleum.

217
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,742
lf l have my way, l'll pull
the damn thing down brick by brick.

218
00:21:38,911 --> 00:21:43,007
This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered
six generations of your family.

219
00:21:43,182 --> 00:21:45,879
Why do you give a damn, Alfred?
lt's not your family.

220
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,589
l give a damn because a good man
once made me responsible...

221
00:21:51,258 --> 00:21:53,420
...for what was most precious to him...

222
00:21:53,594 --> 00:21:55,824
...in the whole world.

223
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:01,327
Miss Dawes has offered
to drive you to the hearing.

224
00:22:01,503 --> 00:22:03,562
She probably hopes
to talk you out of going.

225
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:07,175
Should l just bury the past out there
with my parents, Alfred?

226
00:22:07,344 --> 00:22:10,439
l wouldn't presume to tell you
what to do with your past, sir.

227
00:22:10,614 --> 00:22:14,641
Just know that there are those of us
who care about what you do with your future.

228
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,545
Haven't given up on me yet?

229
00:22:18,223 --> 00:22:19,713
Never.

230
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,682
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk
on the top shelf.

231
00:23:12,485 --> 00:23:14,453
Hasn't he noticed
you're tall enough to reach now?

232
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:16,347
Old habits die hard, l guess.

233
00:23:16,524 --> 00:23:18,890
-Never used to stop us anyway.
-No, it didn't.

234
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,960
How's your mom?

235
00:23:21,362 --> 00:23:23,593
She misses this place.

236
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,624
So do l.

237
00:23:27,035 --> 00:23:28,264
Yeah.

238
00:23:28,438 --> 00:23:31,430
But it's nothing without the people
who made it what it was.

239
00:23:31,607 --> 00:23:34,633
-Now there's only Alfred.
-And you.

240
00:23:34,812 --> 00:23:38,339
-l'm not staying, Rachel.
-You're just back for the hearing.

241
00:23:41,952 --> 00:23:46,151
Bruce, l don't suppose there's any way
to convince you not to come.

242
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:49,951
Someone at this proceeding...

243
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:52,790
...should stand for my parents.

244
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:55,092
We all loved your parents, Bruce.

245
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:58,498
-What Chill did is unforgivable.
-Then why is your boss letting him go?

246
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:03,105
ln prison, he shared a cell
with Carmine Falcone.

247
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:06,940
He learned things, and he will testify
in exchange for early parole.

248
00:24:07,116 --> 00:24:09,778
Rachel, this man killed my parents.

249
00:24:11,787 --> 00:24:13,516
l cannot let that pass.

250
00:24:13,689 --> 00:24:16,557
And l need you
to understand that, please.

251
00:24:18,294 --> 00:24:19,523
Okay.

252
00:24:20,598 --> 00:24:23,931
The depression hit working people,
like Mr. Chill, hardest of all.

253
00:24:24,101 --> 00:24:29,301
His crime was appalling, yes, but it was
motivated not by greed, but by desperation.

254
00:24:29,474 --> 00:24:33,205
Given the 1 4 years served, as well as
his extraordinary level of cooperation...

255
00:24:33,378 --> 00:24:36,143
...with one of this office's
most important investigations...

256
00:24:36,315 --> 00:24:39,478
...we strongly endorse his petition
for early release.

257
00:24:40,486 --> 00:24:42,785
Mr. Chill?

258
00:24:46,393 --> 00:24:48,020
Your Honor...

259
00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:52,058
...not a day goes by that l don't wish
l could take back what l did.

260
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:57,935
Sure, l was desperate,
like a lot of people back then...

261
00:24:58,107 --> 00:25:00,440
...but that don't change what l did.

262
00:25:04,047 --> 00:25:08,747
l gather there is a member
of the Wayne family here today.

263
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,184
Has he got anything to say?

264
00:25:25,905 --> 00:25:28,773
-He's coming out the side!
-He's coming out the side, guys!

265
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,785
Bruce Wayne!

266
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:43,786
Joe! Hey, Joe!

267
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,427
Falcone says hi.

268
00:25:55,773 --> 00:25:59,369
Come on, Bruce.
We don't need to see this.

269
00:26:00,111 --> 00:26:01,669
l do.

270
00:26:06,819 --> 00:26:10,813
The DA couldn't understand why Judge Faden
insisted on making the hearing public.

271
00:26:10,992 --> 00:26:13,391
Falcone paid him off
to get Chill out in the open.

272
00:26:13,594 --> 00:26:14,855
Maybe l should thank them.

273
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:17,589
-You don't mean that.
-What if l do, Rachel?

274
00:26:17,765 --> 00:26:19,700
My parents deserved justice.

275
00:26:19,867 --> 00:26:22,769
You're not talking about justice.
You're talking about revenge.

276
00:26:22,938 --> 00:26:25,839
-Sometimes, they're the same.
-No, they're never the same.

277
00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:29,570
Justice is about harmony. Revenge is about
you making yourself feel better.

278
00:26:29,747 --> 00:26:33,045
-Which is why we have an impartial system.
-Your system is broken.

279
00:26:40,124 --> 00:26:42,958
You care about justice?
Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.

280
00:26:43,396 --> 00:26:44,862
This city is rotting.

281
00:26:45,031 --> 00:26:47,794
They talk about the depression
as if it's history. lt's not.

282
00:26:47,966 --> 00:26:49,457
Things are worse than ever here.

283
00:26:49,635 --> 00:26:52,195
Falcone floods our streets
with crime and drugs...

284
00:26:52,372 --> 00:26:55,307
...preying on the desperate,
creating new Joe Chills every day.

285
00:26:55,475 --> 00:26:58,000
Falcone may not have killed
your parents, Bruce...

286
00:26:58,645 --> 00:27:01,137
...but he's destroying everything
that they stood for.

287
00:27:05,688 --> 00:27:08,589
You wanna thank him for that?
Here you go.

288
00:27:10,459 --> 00:27:11,824
We all know where to find him.

289
00:27:11,994 --> 00:27:15,624
As long as he keeps the bad people rich and
the good people scared, no one'll touch him.

290
00:27:15,832 --> 00:27:19,963
Good people like your parents,
who'll stand against injustice, they're gone.

291
00:27:20,137 --> 00:27:23,038
What chance does Gotham have
when the good people do nothing?

292
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:28,412
-l'm not one of your good people, Rachel.
-What do you mean?

293
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,881
All these years, l wanted to kill him.

294
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,183
Now l can't.

295
00:27:51,973 --> 00:27:53,635
Your father would be ashamed of you.

296
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:39,651
You're taller than you look
in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.

297
00:28:40,096 --> 00:28:41,961
No gun? l'm insulted.

298
00:28:45,135 --> 00:28:49,004
-You could've just sent a thank-you note.
-l didn't come here to thank you.

299
00:28:49,174 --> 00:28:51,870
l came to show you that
not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you.

300
00:28:52,043 --> 00:28:53,670
Only those who know me, kid.

301
00:28:54,012 --> 00:28:56,480
Look around you.
You'll see two councilmen...

302
00:28:56,816 --> 00:28:59,649
...a union official, couple off-duty cops...

303
00:29:00,085 --> 00:29:01,712
...and a judge.

304
00:29:01,887 --> 00:29:06,154
Now, l wouldn't have a second's hesitation
of blowing your head off in front of them.

305
00:29:06,326 --> 00:29:09,056
Now, that's power you can't buy.

306
00:29:09,696 --> 00:29:11,129
That's the power of fear.

307
00:29:11,566 --> 00:29:12,794
l'm not afraid of you.

308
00:29:12,967 --> 00:29:14,867
Because you think you got
nothing to lose.

309
00:29:15,036 --> 00:29:16,664
But you haven't thought it through.

310
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:19,966
You haven't thought about
your lady friend in the DA's office.

311
00:29:20,142 --> 00:29:22,577
You haven't thought about
your old butler.

312
00:29:26,716 --> 00:29:29,049
People from your world...

313
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,586
...have so much to lose.

314
00:29:31,755 --> 00:29:36,089
Now, you think because your mommy
and your daddy got shot...

315
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,230
...you know about the ugly side of life,
but you don't.

316
00:29:39,397 --> 00:29:41,490
You've never tasted desperate.

317
00:29:41,666 --> 00:29:44,227
You're.... You're Bruce Wayne,
the prince of Gotham.

318
00:29:44,403 --> 00:29:47,804
You'd have to go 1 000 miles to meet
someone who didn't know your name.

319
00:29:47,975 --> 00:29:52,274
So don't come down here with your anger,
trying to prove something to yourself.

320
00:29:52,446 --> 00:29:54,540
This is a world you'll never understand.

321
00:29:54,715 --> 00:29:56,741
And you always fear...

322
00:29:56,917 --> 00:29:59,352
...what you don't understand.

323
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,623
All right.

324
00:30:11,234 --> 00:30:14,102
Yeah, you got spirit, kid.
l'll give you that.

325
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,240
More than your old man anyway.

326
00:30:16,406 --> 00:30:20,707
ln the joint, Chill told me about
the night he killed your parents.

327
00:30:20,878 --> 00:30:23,109
He said your father begged for mercy.

328
00:30:24,482 --> 00:30:26,213
Begged.

329
00:30:26,385 --> 00:30:27,784
Like a dog.

330
00:30:40,634 --> 00:30:42,398
Should've tipped better.

331
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:54,246
-For what?
-Your jacket.

332
00:30:54,817 --> 00:30:56,410
Okay.

333
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,980
Hey, hey, hey. Let me have it.
lt's a nice coat.

334
00:31:01,158 --> 00:31:03,252
Be careful who sees you with that.

335
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:05,761
-They're gonna come looking for me.
-Who?

336
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,925
Everyone.

337
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,998
lt's....

338
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:14,140
lt's a nice coat.

339
00:31:32,461 --> 00:31:36,831
When you livee among the criminals,
eie you start to pity them?

340
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,697
The first time I stole
so that I woulen't starve, yes.

341
00:31:40,904 --> 00:31:46,365
I lost many assumptions about
the simple nature of right ane wrong.

342
00:31:47,646 --> 00:31:49,739
Ane when I travelee...

343
00:31:49,914 --> 00:31:52,610
...I learnee the fear before a crime...

344
00:31:53,386 --> 00:31:55,946
...ane the thrill of success.

345
00:31:57,823 --> 00:31:59,688
But I never became one of them.

346
00:32:03,163 --> 00:32:06,098
Fool. What do l care what your name is?
You're a criminal.

347
00:32:07,501 --> 00:32:09,332
Tell that to the guy who owned these.

348
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:16,500
You've traveled the world to understand
the criminal mind and conquer your fears.

349
00:32:18,614 --> 00:32:22,711
But a criminal is not complicated.

350
00:32:22,885 --> 00:32:26,219
And what you really fear
is inside yourself.

351
00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:28,950
You fear your own power.

352
00:32:29,126 --> 00:32:30,388
You fear your anger...

353
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:35,128
...the drive to do great or terrible things.

354
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,736
Now you must journey inwards.

355
00:32:42,508 --> 00:32:44,601
You are ready.

356
00:32:45,578 --> 00:32:47,011
Breathe.

357
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:58,459
Breathe.

358
00:33:03,432 --> 00:33:05,298
Breathe in your fears.

359
00:33:07,937 --> 00:33:08,927
Face them.

360
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,238
To conquer fear, you must become fear.

361
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:16,812
You must bask in the fear of other men.

362
00:33:18,249 --> 00:33:21,685
And men fear most
what they cannot see.

363
00:33:38,906 --> 00:33:41,774
You have to become a terrible thought.

364
00:33:46,348 --> 00:33:47,543
A wraith.

365
00:33:53,257 --> 00:33:55,623
You have to become an idea!

366
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,561
Feel terror cloud your senses.

367
00:34:07,306 --> 00:34:10,503
Feel its power to distort.

368
00:34:11,477 --> 00:34:13,708
To control.

369
00:34:16,783 --> 00:34:20,583
And know that this power can be yours.

370
00:34:33,135 --> 00:34:35,798
Embrace your worst fear.

371
00:34:42,813 --> 00:34:45,077
Become one with the darkness.

372
00:35:04,939 --> 00:35:06,634
Focus.

373
00:35:06,941 --> 00:35:09,102
Concentrate.

374
00:35:09,277 --> 00:35:11,371
Master your senses.

375
00:35:39,478 --> 00:35:41,913
You cannot leave any sign.

376
00:35:42,283 --> 00:35:43,510
l haven't.

377
00:35:51,793 --> 00:35:53,784
lmpressive.

378
00:36:03,272 --> 00:36:05,002
We have purged your fear.

379
00:36:06,142 --> 00:36:07,770
You are ready to lead these men.

380
00:36:07,946 --> 00:36:11,473
You are ready to become a member
of the League of Shadows.

381
00:36:14,118 --> 00:36:18,282
But first, you must demonstrate
your commitment to justice.

382
00:36:35,042 --> 00:36:36,407
No.

383
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:39,141
l'm no executioner.

384
00:36:39,715 --> 00:36:43,379
Your compassion is a weakness
your enemies will not share.

385
00:36:43,752 --> 00:36:46,016
That's why it's so important.

386
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:48,019
lt separates us from them.

387
00:36:48,191 --> 00:36:50,591
You want to fight criminals.
This man is a murderer.

388
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,558
-This man should be tried.
-By whom?

389
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,425
Corrupt bureaucrats?

390
00:36:54,598 --> 00:36:57,090
Criminals mock society's laws.

391
00:36:57,268 --> 00:36:59,566
You know this better than most.

392
00:37:00,438 --> 00:37:03,033
You cannot lead these men...

393
00:37:03,208 --> 00:37:07,202
...unless you are prepared to do
what is necessary to defeat evil.

394
00:37:07,813 --> 00:37:10,247
And where would l be leading
these men?

395
00:37:10,783 --> 00:37:12,046
Gotham.

396
00:37:12,218 --> 00:37:14,278
As Gotham's favored son...

397
00:37:14,454 --> 00:37:18,789
...you will be ideally placed
to strike at the heart of criminality.

398
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,927
-How?
-Gotham's time has come.

399
00:37:23,098 --> 00:37:26,231
Like Constantinople or Rome before it...

400
00:37:26,302 --> 00:37:30,500
...the city has become a breeding ground
for suffering and injustice.

401
00:37:30,673 --> 00:37:34,269
lt is beyond saving
and must be allowed to die.

402
00:37:34,444 --> 00:37:39,644
This is the most important function
of the League of Shadows.

403
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:43,012
lt is one we've performed for centuries.

404
00:37:43,355 --> 00:37:45,084
Gotham...

405
00:37:45,257 --> 00:37:48,158
...must be destroyed.

406
00:37:51,464 --> 00:37:52,989
You can't believe in this.

407
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:57,727
Ra's al Ghul rescued us from
the darkest corners of our own hearts.

408
00:37:57,905 --> 00:38:02,309
What he asks in return is the courage
to do what is necessary.

409
00:38:02,543 --> 00:38:05,877
l will go back to Gotham
and l will fight men like this...

410
00:38:06,047 --> 00:38:08,608
...but l will not become an executioner.

411
00:38:08,785 --> 00:38:10,343
Bruce, please.

412
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,354
For your own sake,
there is no turning back.

413
00:38:45,693 --> 00:38:48,253
-What are you doing?
-What's necessary, my friend.

414
00:41:04,686 --> 00:41:07,815
l will tell him you saved his life.

415
00:41:26,578 --> 00:41:29,104
Master Wayne,
you've been gone a long time.

416
00:41:29,281 --> 00:41:31,546
-Yes, l have.
-You look very fashionable.

417
00:41:33,086 --> 00:41:34,553
Apart from the mud.

418
00:41:34,821 --> 00:41:37,484
Are you coming back to Gotham
for long, sir?

419
00:41:37,658 --> 00:41:38,885
As long as it takes.

420
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:40,550
l want to show the people...

421
00:41:40,728 --> 00:41:44,164
...their city doesn't belong
to the criminals and the corrupt.

422
00:41:44,332 --> 00:41:47,530
ln the depression, your father nearly
bankrupted Wayne Enterprises...

423
00:41:47,703 --> 00:41:48,931
...combating poverty.

424
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:53,632
He believed his example could inspire
the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.

425
00:41:53,943 --> 00:41:55,536
Did it?

426
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,147
ln a way.

427
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:01,375
Their murder shocked the wealthy
and the powerful into action.

428
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:06,448
People need dramatic examples
to shake them out of apathy.

429
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:08,286
l can't do that as Bruce Wayne.

430
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,985
As a man...

431
00:42:10,163 --> 00:42:12,563
...l'm flesh and blood,
l can be ignored, destroyed.

432
00:42:12,731 --> 00:42:14,666
But as a symbol....

433
00:42:16,135 --> 00:42:18,763
As a symbol, l can be incorruptible.

434
00:42:18,939 --> 00:42:21,567
-l can be everlasting.
-What symbol?

435
00:42:22,177 --> 00:42:24,839
Something elemental...

436
00:42:25,012 --> 00:42:26,640
...something terrifying.

437
00:42:26,815 --> 00:42:28,908
l assume that as you take on
the underworld...

438
00:42:29,085 --> 00:42:34,216
...this symbol is a persona to protect
those you care about from reprisals?

439
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,755
You're thinking about Rachel?

440
00:42:35,925 --> 00:42:38,292
Actually, sir, l was thinking of myself.

441
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:42,059
Have you told anyone l'm coming back?

442
00:42:42,265 --> 00:42:46,464
l couldn't figure the legal ramifications
of bringing you back from the dead.

443
00:42:46,637 --> 00:42:48,537
-Dead?
-You've been gone seven years.

444
00:42:48,706 --> 00:42:49,968
You had me declared dead?

445
00:42:50,141 --> 00:42:53,042
Actually, it was Mr. Earle.
He's taking the company public.

446
00:42:53,212 --> 00:42:55,477
He wanted to liquidate
your majority shareholding.

447
00:42:55,648 --> 00:42:57,979
Those shares are worth
quite a bit of money.

448
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:00,881
Well, it's a good thing
l left everything to you, then.

449
00:43:01,421 --> 00:43:03,151
Quite so, sir.

450
00:43:03,323 --> 00:43:06,953
And you can borrow the Rolls, if you like.
Just bring it back with a full tank.

451
00:43:17,005 --> 00:43:21,739
ln my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much
a danger to himself as to others...

452
00:43:22,111 --> 00:43:26,674
...and prison is probably not
the best environment for his rehabilitation.

453
00:43:28,986 --> 00:43:31,581
-Dr. Crane.
-Miss Dawes.

454
00:43:31,756 --> 00:43:35,021
You think a man who butchers people
for the mob doesn't belong in jail?

455
00:43:35,193 --> 00:43:37,856
l would hardly have testified to that
otherwise, would l?

456
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:41,124
This is the third of Falcone's thugs
you've had declared insane...

457
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,700
...and moved into your asylum.

458
00:43:42,935 --> 00:43:47,567
Well, the work offered by organized crime
must have an attraction to the insane.

459
00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:51,101
Or the corrupt.

460
00:43:53,347 --> 00:43:54,940
Mr. Finch.

461
00:43:55,284 --> 00:43:57,081
You should check
with Miss Dawes here...

462
00:43:57,252 --> 00:44:01,621
...just what implications your office
has authorized her to make. lf any.

463
00:44:05,595 --> 00:44:07,928
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing, Carl?

464
00:44:08,098 --> 00:44:09,463
Looking out for you.

465
00:44:11,969 --> 00:44:14,870
Falcone has half the city
bought and paid for.

466
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:17,099
-Drop it.
-How can you say that?

467
00:44:17,275 --> 00:44:20,973
Because as much as l care about
getting Falcone, l care more about you.

468
00:44:21,146 --> 00:44:22,443
That's sweet.

469
00:44:27,854 --> 00:44:30,220
We've been through all that.

470
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,753
Blessed bat again, sir.

471
00:44:58,222 --> 00:45:00,623
They nest somewhere in the grounds.

472
00:46:58,527 --> 00:47:01,224
No more favors.
Someone is sniffing around.

473
00:47:01,398 --> 00:47:04,367
Hey, l scratch your back,
you scratch mine, doc.

474
00:47:04,534 --> 00:47:05,899
l'm bringing in the shipments.

475
00:47:06,603 --> 00:47:07,832
We are paying you for that.

476
00:47:08,005 --> 00:47:10,496
Maybe money isn't as interesting
to me as favors.

477
00:47:13,011 --> 00:47:17,812
l am more than aware that you are
not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.

478
00:47:17,983 --> 00:47:21,044
But you know who l'm working for,
and when he gets here--

479
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,154
He-- He's coming to Gotham?

480
00:47:23,322 --> 00:47:24,755
Yes, he is.

481
00:47:24,924 --> 00:47:27,393
And when he gets here,
he's not going to wanna hear...

482
00:47:27,561 --> 00:47:32,658
...that you have endangered our operation
just to get your thugs out of a little jail time.

483
00:47:33,634 --> 00:47:37,003
-Who's bothering you?
-There's a girl at the DA's office.

484
00:47:37,472 --> 00:47:39,270
-We'll buy her off.
-Not this one.

485
00:47:40,409 --> 00:47:42,309
ldealist, huh?

486
00:47:42,478 --> 00:47:44,207
Well, there's an answer to that too.

487
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:47,550
-l don't want to know.
-Yes, you do.

488
00:47:51,722 --> 00:47:55,158
No, we are showing very healthy growth
in these sectors.

489
00:47:55,326 --> 00:47:58,523
l don't think Thomas Wayne would have
viewed heavy-arms manufacture...

490
00:47:58,696 --> 00:48:00,824
...as a suitable cornerstone
for our business.

491
00:48:02,234 --> 00:48:06,035
Well, that's 20 years ago, Fredericks.

492
00:48:06,339 --> 00:48:09,503
l think after 20 years
we can allow ourselves...

493
00:48:09,676 --> 00:48:12,544
...to stop thinking about what
Thomas Wayne would have done.

494
00:48:12,713 --> 00:48:14,578
Good morning, Mr. Earle's office.

495
00:48:14,748 --> 00:48:18,048
Yes, he's confirmed for
the dinner tomorrow evening.

496
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:21,519
Good morning. l'm here to see Mr. Earle.

497
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,214
Name?

498
00:48:23,659 --> 00:48:25,320
Bruce Wayne.

499
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:30,388
Thomas would probably not
have taken the company public.

500
00:48:30,468 --> 00:48:34,598
But that is what we,
as responsible managers, are going to do.

501
00:48:35,272 --> 00:48:36,830
Jessica?

502
00:48:37,909 --> 00:48:40,433
Jessica? Where are you?

503
00:48:40,612 --> 00:48:44,878
-Eye on the ball, and....
-Why is no one answering the phone?

504
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:48,714
lt's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle.
l'm sure they'll call back.

505
00:48:49,055 --> 00:48:51,546
Bruce? You're supposed to be dead.

506
00:48:51,725 --> 00:48:53,659
l'm sorry to disappoint.

507
00:48:53,827 --> 00:48:56,557
-l need you to take a look at this.
-Have you seen him yet?

508
00:48:56,865 --> 00:48:58,389
-Who?
-Wayne.

509
00:48:58,733 --> 00:49:00,792
lt's been all over the news.
He's back.

510
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:07,641
l'm sure you realize
l can't stop the big machine.

511
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:09,038
Too many wheels turning.

512
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:11,237
-We're going public.
-l understand.

513
00:49:11,714 --> 00:49:14,513
And l'll be handsomely rewarded
for my shares.

514
00:49:14,684 --> 00:49:17,245
l'm not looking to interfere.

515
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:19,815
-l am looking for a job.
-Oh?

516
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:23,051
l just want to get to know the company
that my family built.

517
00:49:23,361 --> 00:49:25,125
Any ideas where you would start?

518
00:49:25,631 --> 00:49:27,998
Applied Sciences caught my eye.

519
00:49:28,367 --> 00:49:30,097
Fox's department.

520
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:32,261
l'll let him know you're coming.

521
00:49:33,173 --> 00:49:35,937
You look like him. Your dad.

522
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:39,406
You're the only one left
of the Wayne family.

523
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:43,539
This is where you belong.
Welcome home.

524
00:49:43,818 --> 00:49:48,346
Environmental procedures, defense projects,
consumer products.

525
00:49:48,857 --> 00:49:51,587
All prototypes. None in production.

526
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,423
-On any level whatsoever.
-None?

527
00:49:55,398 --> 00:49:57,264
What did they tell you this place was?

528
00:49:57,434 --> 00:49:59,459
They didn't tell me anything.

529
00:50:01,905 --> 00:50:05,364
Earle told me exactly what it was
when he sent me down here.

530
00:50:05,843 --> 00:50:07,311
Dead end.

531
00:50:07,478 --> 00:50:10,811
Place to keep me from causing
the board any more trouble.

532
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,240
Come on.

533
00:50:13,419 --> 00:50:15,887
-You were on the board?
-When your father ran things.

534
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:17,956
-You knew my father?
-Oh, yeah.

535
00:50:18,124 --> 00:50:19,751
Helped him build his train.

536
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,988
Here we are.

537
00:50:25,666 --> 00:50:27,293
Kevlar utility harness.

538
00:50:27,668 --> 00:50:29,636
Gas-powered, magnetic grapple gun.

539
00:50:29,804 --> 00:50:32,103
The 350-pound test monofilament.

540
00:50:35,444 --> 00:50:37,640
Wonderful project, your dad's train.

541
00:50:38,147 --> 00:50:42,744
Routed it right into Wayne Tower,
along with the water and power utilities.

542
00:50:42,919 --> 00:50:46,151
Kind of made Wayne Tower
the unofficial center of Gotham City.

543
00:50:46,358 --> 00:50:48,986
Of course, Earle let it go to rot.
Here we are.

544
00:50:50,862 --> 00:50:52,989
Nomex survival suit
for advanced infantry.

545
00:50:53,198 --> 00:50:55,929
Kevlar biweave, reinforced joints.

546
00:50:56,269 --> 00:50:58,635
-Tear-resistant?
-This sucker will stop a knife.

547
00:50:58,804 --> 00:51:01,034
-Bulletproof?
-Anything but a straight shot.

548
00:51:01,207 --> 00:51:04,803
-Why didn't they put it into production?
-Bean counters didn't think a soldier's life...

549
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:06,605
...was worth 300 grand.

550
00:51:07,715 --> 00:51:11,151
So, what's your interest in it, Mr. Wayne?

551
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:13,343
l want to borrow it.

552
00:51:13,521 --> 00:51:15,285
For spelunking.

553
00:51:16,158 --> 00:51:17,455
Spelunking?

554
00:51:17,626 --> 00:51:19,355
Yeah, you know, cave diving?

555
00:51:20,629 --> 00:51:23,292
You expecting to run into
much gunfire in these caves?

556
00:51:25,635 --> 00:51:28,900
Look, l'd rather Mr. Earle
didn't know about me borrowing--

557
00:51:29,072 --> 00:51:30,301
Mr. Wayne...

558
00:51:30,541 --> 00:51:32,441
...the way l see it...

559
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:35,344
...all this stuff is yours anyway.

560
00:51:38,317 --> 00:51:40,809
Okay. Give it a try.

561
00:51:44,957 --> 00:51:46,185
Charming.

562
00:51:49,063 --> 00:51:50,826
At least you'll have company.

563
00:51:52,733 --> 00:51:56,693
This must be the lowest foundation
of the southeast wing.

564
00:52:09,185 --> 00:52:13,385
ln the Civil War, your great-great-grandfather
was involved in the Underground Railroad...

565
00:52:13,557 --> 00:52:16,527
...secretly transporting freed slaves
to the North...

566
00:52:16,694 --> 00:52:20,392
...and l suspect these caverns
came in handy.

567
00:52:33,079 --> 00:52:35,275
Alfred! Come up here!

568
00:52:35,483 --> 00:52:38,418
l can see everything all right
from down here, sir, thank you.

569
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:01,103
We order the main part
of this cowl from Singapore.

570
00:53:01,279 --> 00:53:02,769
Via a dummy corporation.

571
00:53:02,947 --> 00:53:04,812
lndeed. And then, quite separately...

572
00:53:04,983 --> 00:53:09,921
...we place an order
to a Chinese company for these.

573
00:53:10,456 --> 00:53:13,426
-Put it together ourselves.
-Precisely.

574
00:53:13,593 --> 00:53:17,620
They'll have to be large orders,
to avoid suspicion.

575
00:53:17,799 --> 00:53:20,359
-How large?
-Say 1 0,000.

576
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:25,806
-Well, at least we'll have spares.
-Yes.

577
00:53:42,893 --> 00:53:44,953
Don't suppose you want a taste.

578
00:53:45,129 --> 00:53:48,293
l just keep offering,
thinking maybe someday you'll get wise.

579
00:53:48,467 --> 00:53:50,628
There's nothing wise
in what you do, Flass.

580
00:53:50,802 --> 00:53:54,170
Well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste,
makes us guys nervous.

581
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:56,205
l'm no rat.

582
00:53:58,946 --> 00:54:02,643
ln a town this bent,
who's there to rat to anyway?

583
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:34,478
Don't turn around.

584
00:54:35,053 --> 00:54:38,147
You're a good cop.
One of the few.

585
00:54:38,824 --> 00:54:39,951
What do you want?

586
00:54:40,126 --> 00:54:43,290
Carmine Falcone brings in
shipments of drugs every week.

587
00:54:43,463 --> 00:54:45,261
Nobody takes him down. Why?

588
00:54:46,667 --> 00:54:48,794
He's paid up with the right people.

589
00:54:49,103 --> 00:54:51,867
What will it take to bring him down?

590
00:54:52,607 --> 00:54:55,007
Leverage on Judge Faden...

591
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:58,111
...and a DA brave enough
to prosecute.

592
00:54:58,514 --> 00:55:00,140
Rachel Dawes.

593
00:55:00,716 --> 00:55:01,842
Who are you?

594
00:55:02,251 --> 00:55:03,878
Watch for my sign.

595
00:55:06,557 --> 00:55:08,582
You're just one man?

596
00:55:09,027 --> 00:55:10,460
Now we're two.

597
00:55:12,564 --> 00:55:14,156
We?

598
00:55:29,816 --> 00:55:31,545
Freeze!

599
00:55:48,738 --> 00:55:50,673
What the hell was that?

600
00:55:53,977 --> 00:55:55,205
Just some nut.

601
00:55:58,616 --> 00:56:01,414
Well, what is it today? More spelunking?

602
00:56:01,586 --> 00:56:04,054
No. Today it's BASE-jumping.

603
00:56:04,656 --> 00:56:06,283
BASE-jumping.

604
00:56:06,858 --> 00:56:09,420
-That like parachuting?
-Kind of.

605
00:56:10,629 --> 00:56:13,427
Do you have any lightweight fabrics?

606
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,262
You know, l think l have just the thing.

607
00:56:17,604 --> 00:56:20,039
lt's called memory cloth.
Notice anything?

608
00:56:23,377 --> 00:56:25,278
Regularly flexible...

609
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,808
...but put a current through it...

610
00:56:29,284 --> 00:56:32,948
-...molecules realign, it becomes rigid.
-What kind of shapes can you make?

611
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:36,251
Can be tailored to fit any structure
based on a rigid skeleton.

612
00:56:36,427 --> 00:56:37,654
Too expensive for the Army?

613
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:42,561
l don't think they tried to market it to the
billionaire, spelunking, BASE-jumping crowd.

614
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,531
-Look, Mr. Fox.
-Yes, sir?

615
00:56:45,203 --> 00:56:46,568
lf you're uncomfortable--

616
00:56:46,738 --> 00:56:49,935
Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me
exactly what you're doing...

617
00:56:50,108 --> 00:56:52,077
...when l'm asked, l don't have to lie.

618
00:56:53,846 --> 00:56:56,441
But don't think of me as an idiot.

619
00:56:57,951 --> 00:56:59,920
Fair enough.

620
00:57:01,855 --> 00:57:03,653
What's that?

621
00:57:05,693 --> 00:57:07,661
The Tumbler?

622
00:57:08,162 --> 00:57:10,130
Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.

623
00:57:16,138 --> 00:57:18,073
She was built as a bridging vehicle.

624
00:57:20,043 --> 00:57:24,481
During combat, two of these
would jump over a river, towing cables.

625
00:57:27,017 --> 00:57:30,647
Over here on the throttle,
flip that open and throttle up.

626
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:33,382
This will boost you into a rampless jump--
Not now!

627
00:57:36,229 --> 00:57:38,355
Not-- Not now, sir.

628
00:57:41,167 --> 00:57:43,067
Afterburner eisengagee.

629
00:57:43,436 --> 00:57:46,463
We never could get
the damn bridge to work...

630
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,369
...but this baby works just fine.

631
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,148
So, what do you think?

632
00:58:00,423 --> 00:58:02,413
Does it come in black?

633
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:05,425
l need you at the docks Thursday.

634
00:58:05,662 --> 00:58:07,562
-Problems?
-l don't want any trouble...

635
00:58:07,731 --> 00:58:09,825
-...with the last shipment.
-Sure.

636
00:58:11,435 --> 00:58:15,099
Word on the street is you got a beef
with somebody in the DA's office.

637
00:58:15,274 --> 00:58:17,674
-ls that right?
-And that there's a fat prize...

638
00:58:17,843 --> 00:58:20,539
...waiting for anybody willing
to do anything about it.

639
00:58:20,713 --> 00:58:22,680
So, what's your point, Mr. Flass?

640
00:58:23,149 --> 00:58:24,377
Have you seen the girl?

641
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,581
It's a cute little assistant DA.

642
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:31,418
Don't you think that's a little bit
too much heat to bring eown, maybe?

643
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:34,891
-Even for this town.
-Never underestimate Gotham City.

644
00:58:35,062 --> 00:58:37,896
People get mugged coming home
from work every day of the week.

645
00:58:38,066 --> 00:58:40,694
Sometimes--
Sometimes things just go bad.

646
00:58:44,574 --> 00:58:46,371
lt's a problem with the graphite, sir.

647
00:58:46,577 --> 00:58:49,273
The next 1 0,000
will be up to specifications.

648
00:58:49,446 --> 00:58:52,006
-At least they gave us a discount.
-Quite.

649
00:58:52,182 --> 00:58:57,815
ln the meantime, sir, may l suggest
you try to avoid landing on your head?

650
00:59:34,831 --> 00:59:36,856
Why bats, Master Wayne?

651
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,363
Bats frighten me.

652
00:59:39,638 --> 00:59:41,935
lt's time my enemies shared my dread.

653
01:00:08,637 --> 01:00:10,571
What is this?

654
01:00:14,076 --> 01:00:15,669
Continue.

655
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:22,879
Looks fine out there.

656
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:25,187
The bears go straight to the dealers.

657
01:00:25,356 --> 01:00:28,018
Yeah, and the rabbits go
to the man in the Narrows.

658
01:00:28,193 --> 01:00:31,219
-What's the difference?
-lgnorance is bliss, my friend.

659
01:00:31,396 --> 01:00:34,559
Don't burden yourself
with the secrets of scary people.

660
01:00:50,418 --> 01:00:53,387
Hey. Steiss.

661
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:16,180
Steiss?

662
01:01:28,129 --> 01:01:29,721
What?

663
01:01:30,499 --> 01:01:31,965
What the...?

664
01:01:40,943 --> 01:01:42,808
l better check it.

665
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,352
There's a problem out here.
You better bail.

666
01:02:26,662 --> 01:02:28,290
Where are you?!

667
01:02:28,465 --> 01:02:29,523
Here.

668
01:02:50,591 --> 01:02:53,890
Get going. Oh, shit.

669
01:03:12,048 --> 01:03:14,175
What the hell are you?

670
01:03:17,221 --> 01:03:18,380
l'm Batman.

671
01:03:26,732 --> 01:03:28,700
Nice coat.

672
01:03:30,436 --> 01:03:31,959
Thanks.

673
01:04:13,018 --> 01:04:14,247
Hold it.

674
01:04:16,389 --> 01:04:18,857
That's right, you better run.

675
01:04:27,802 --> 01:04:29,668
Falcone sent them to kill you.

676
01:04:30,772 --> 01:04:33,367
-Why?
-You rattled his cage.

677
01:04:37,146 --> 01:04:38,704
-What's this?
-Leverage.

678
01:04:38,881 --> 01:04:40,474
-For what?
-To get things moving.

679
01:04:40,783 --> 01:04:42,774
Who are you?

680
01:04:43,186 --> 01:04:44,415
Someone like you.

681
01:04:44,588 --> 01:04:46,613
Someone who'll rattle the cages.

682
01:04:51,730 --> 01:04:55,223
Ma'am? Everything okay?

683
01:04:59,538 --> 01:05:02,030
-Falcone's men?
-Does it matter?

684
01:05:02,208 --> 01:05:04,473
We'll never tie him to it anyway.

685
01:05:04,711 --> 01:05:06,804
l wouldn't be too sure of that.

686
01:05:19,862 --> 01:05:21,693
What the hell is that?

687
01:05:31,308 --> 01:05:32,570
Cut him down.

688
01:05:55,170 --> 01:05:56,398
Unacceptable.

689
01:05:56,571 --> 01:05:59,404
Now, l don't care if it's rival gangs,
Guardian Angels...

690
01:05:59,574 --> 01:06:01,543
...or the goddamn Salvation Army...

691
01:06:01,811 --> 01:06:04,143
...get them off the street
and off the front page.

692
01:06:04,313 --> 01:06:06,873
They say it was just one guy.
Or a creature.

693
01:06:07,049 --> 01:06:09,746
lt was some asshole in a costume.

694
01:06:10,253 --> 01:06:11,948
-Yeah?
-This guy did deliver us...

695
01:06:12,122 --> 01:06:14,887
...one of the city's biggest crime lords.

696
01:06:15,059 --> 01:06:18,551
No one takes the law
into their own hands in my city.

697
01:06:18,731 --> 01:06:19,958
Understand?

698
01:06:20,231 --> 01:06:22,700
-No way to bury it now.
-There's still Judge Faden.

699
01:06:22,868 --> 01:06:26,065
-l've got Faden covered.
-What about this bat they're babbling about?

700
01:06:26,138 --> 01:06:29,131
Even if these guys will swear
to being thrashed by a giant bat...

701
01:06:29,309 --> 01:06:31,470
...we've got Falcone at the scene.

702
01:06:31,646 --> 01:06:34,843
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests.
This bat character gave us everything.

703
01:06:35,282 --> 01:06:36,806
Okay. Let's do it.

704
01:06:40,254 --> 01:06:42,347
-Bats are nocturnal.
-Bats may be.

705
01:06:42,557 --> 01:06:45,958
But even for billionaire playboys,
3:00 is pushing it.

706
01:06:46,996 --> 01:06:49,863
The price for leading a double life, l fear.

707
01:06:51,234 --> 01:06:53,634
Your theatrics made an impression.

708
01:06:55,005 --> 01:06:58,031
Theatricality and deception...

709
01:06:58,208 --> 01:07:01,439
...are powerful weapons, Alfred.
This is a good start.

710
01:07:01,612 --> 01:07:04,411
lf those are to be the first
of many injuries to come...

711
01:07:04,582 --> 01:07:07,416
...it would be wise
to find a suitable excuse.

712
01:07:07,719 --> 01:07:09,085
Polo, for instance.

713
01:07:09,254 --> 01:07:10,882
l'm not learning polo, Alfred.

714
01:07:11,158 --> 01:07:14,820
Strange injuries,
a nonexistent social life.

715
01:07:14,994 --> 01:07:16,462
These things beg the question...

716
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:20,863
...as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne
do with his time and his money.

717
01:07:21,035 --> 01:07:22,627
What does someone like me do?

718
01:07:23,571 --> 01:07:27,804
Drive sports cars, date movie stars.

719
01:07:28,477 --> 01:07:30,035
Buy things that are not for sale.

720
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:33,773
Who knows, Master Wayne,
you start pretending to have fun...

721
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:36,375
...you might even have a little
by accident.

722
01:07:39,090 --> 01:07:40,557
Sir.

723
01:07:40,725 --> 01:07:43,057
-We have a situation.
-All right.

724
01:07:43,462 --> 01:07:47,262
The Coast Guard picked up
one of our cargo ships last night...

725
01:07:47,833 --> 01:07:52,600
...heavily damaged, all crew missing,
probably dead.

726
01:07:54,673 --> 01:07:59,043
The ship was carrying a prototype weapon.
It's a microwave emitter.

727
01:07:59,213 --> 01:08:02,182
lt's designed for desert warfare, but it--

728
01:08:03,852 --> 01:08:05,410
lt looks like somebody...

729
01:08:09,824 --> 01:08:11,314
...turned it on.

730
01:08:15,498 --> 01:08:19,936
lt uses focused microwaves to
vaporize the enemy's water supply.

731
01:08:27,879 --> 01:08:30,814
The eamage to the ship
was catastrophic.

732
01:08:30,982 --> 01:08:33,975
The weapon itself is....

733
01:08:35,287 --> 01:08:36,777
Missing?

734
01:08:37,623 --> 01:08:38,886
Yeah.

735
01:08:40,193 --> 01:08:42,127
Mr. Wayne.

736
01:08:45,866 --> 01:08:47,299
Nice car.

737
01:08:47,468 --> 01:08:48,867
You should see my other one.

738
01:08:58,881 --> 01:09:00,815
He's done something
the police never have.

739
01:09:00,983 --> 01:09:03,282
You can't take the law
into your own hands.

740
01:09:03,453 --> 01:09:06,013
Well, at least he's getting
something done.

741
01:09:06,190 --> 01:09:08,522
Bruce, help me out here.

742
01:09:08,692 --> 01:09:13,062
Well, a guy who dresses up
like a bat clearly has issues.

743
01:09:14,098 --> 01:09:16,328
But he's put Falcone behind bars.

744
01:09:16,501 --> 01:09:18,867
Now the cops want to bring him in.
What does that tell you?

745
01:09:19,037 --> 01:09:20,266
They're jealous.

746
01:09:20,439 --> 01:09:23,067
Sir, the pool is for decoration...

747
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:26,609
...and your friends
do not have swimwear.

748
01:09:28,415 --> 01:09:30,384
Well, they're European.

749
01:09:32,252 --> 01:09:34,619
l'm going to have to ask you to leave.

750
01:09:35,523 --> 01:09:38,982
-lt is not a question of money.
-Well, you see...

751
01:09:39,595 --> 01:09:41,358
...l'm buying this hotel...

752
01:09:43,165 --> 01:09:47,569
...and setting some new rules
about the pool area.

753
01:09:48,738 --> 01:09:51,139
l think the Batman deserves a medal.

754
01:09:51,308 --> 01:09:53,435
And a straitjacket to pin it on.

755
01:09:59,918 --> 01:10:01,510
Thank you.

756
01:10:03,256 --> 01:10:04,621
Bruce?

757
01:10:08,194 --> 01:10:09,992
Rachel?

758
01:10:10,163 --> 01:10:11,561
l'd heard you were back.

759
01:10:13,634 --> 01:10:15,101
What are you doing?

760
01:10:15,869 --> 01:10:20,307
Just swimming here.
Wow, it is good to see you.

761
01:10:20,475 --> 01:10:21,999
You were gone a long time.

762
01:10:22,577 --> 01:10:25,513
-l know. How are things?
-The same.

763
01:10:27,416 --> 01:10:29,077
Job's getting worse.

764
01:10:29,251 --> 01:10:31,982
Can't change the world on your own.

765
01:10:32,155 --> 01:10:34,214
What choice do l have...

766
01:10:34,891 --> 01:10:36,655
...when you're too busy swimming?

767
01:10:37,961 --> 01:10:40,021
Rachel, all of--

768
01:10:40,331 --> 01:10:41,959
All this....

769
01:10:43,402 --> 01:10:47,430
lt's-- lt's not me. lt's....

770
01:10:47,873 --> 01:10:50,502
lnside, l am....

771
01:10:51,711 --> 01:10:53,645
l am more.

772
01:10:54,315 --> 01:10:55,873
Come on, Bruce. Come on.

773
01:10:56,050 --> 01:10:59,850
Bruce, we have some more hotels
for you to buy.

774
01:11:00,888 --> 01:11:02,355
Bruce...

775
01:11:03,491 --> 01:11:07,018
...deep down you may still be
that same great kid you used to be.

776
01:11:09,432 --> 01:11:12,026
But it's not who you are underneath...

777
01:11:12,468 --> 01:11:14,231
...it's what you do that defines you.

778
01:11:26,784 --> 01:11:28,377
Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.

779
01:11:28,553 --> 01:11:31,421
Not at all. He cut his wrists?

780
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:35,253
Probably looking for the insanity plea.
But if anything should happen....

781
01:11:35,428 --> 01:11:38,363
Of course, better safe than sorry.

782
01:11:41,802 --> 01:11:45,363
Yeah, Dr. Crane, l can't take it anymore.
lt's all too much.

783
01:11:45,539 --> 01:11:48,008
The walls are closing in. Blah, blah, blah.

784
01:11:48,543 --> 01:11:51,067
A couple of days of this food,
it'll be true.

785
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,741
-What do you want?
-l wanna know...

786
01:11:53,916 --> 01:11:56,384
...how you're gonna convince me
to keep my mouth shut.

787
01:11:56,552 --> 01:11:58,747
About what?
You don't know anything.

788
01:11:58,921 --> 01:12:03,085
l know you don't want the cops to take
a closer look at the drugs they seized.

789
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:07,425
And l know about your experiments
with the inmates of your nut house.

790
01:12:07,598 --> 01:12:11,262
See, l don't go into business with a guy
without finding out his dirty secrets.

791
01:12:11,836 --> 01:12:14,737
And those goons you used.

792
01:12:14,906 --> 01:12:16,738
l own the muscle in this town.

793
01:12:16,909 --> 01:12:20,311
Now, l've been bringing
your stuff in for months...

794
01:12:20,547 --> 01:12:24,745
...so whatever he's planning,
it's big, and l want in.

795
01:12:26,053 --> 01:12:29,181
Well, l already know what he'll say.

796
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:30,956
That we should kill you.

797
01:12:32,562 --> 01:12:35,860
Even he can't get me in here.
Not in my town.

798
01:12:41,805 --> 01:12:43,329
Would you like to see my mask?

799
01:12:44,908 --> 01:12:46,341
l use it in my experiments.

800
01:12:49,247 --> 01:12:53,708
Now, l'm probably not very frightening
to a guy like you.

801
01:12:54,118 --> 01:12:56,916
But these crazies, they can't stand it.

802
01:12:57,823 --> 01:12:59,815
So when did the nut
take over the nut house?

803
01:13:00,759 --> 01:13:03,456
They scream and they cry...

804
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:06,057
...much as you're doing now.

805
01:13:08,402 --> 01:13:11,599
Well, he's not faking. Not that one.

806
01:13:11,772 --> 01:13:14,332
l'll talk to the judge
and see if l can get him moved...

807
01:13:14,509 --> 01:13:17,910
...to the secure wing at Arkham.
l can't treat him here.

808
01:13:39,939 --> 01:13:41,429
Storm's coming.

809
01:13:46,046 --> 01:13:49,038
The scum is getting jumpy
because you stood up to Falcone.

810
01:13:49,215 --> 01:13:52,742
lt's a start. Your partner
was at the docks with Falcone.

811
01:13:52,919 --> 01:13:55,616
Well, he moonlights
as a low-level enforcer.

812
01:13:55,990 --> 01:13:59,791
They were splitting the shipment in two.
Only half went to the dealers.

813
01:13:59,962 --> 01:14:01,895
Why? What about the other half?

814
01:14:02,364 --> 01:14:04,764
-Flass knows.
-He won't talk.

815
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:06,959
He'll talk to me.

816
01:14:07,136 --> 01:14:10,162
Commissioner Loeb set up
a massive task force to catch you.

817
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:13,166
-He thinks you're dangerous.
-What do you think?

818
01:14:14,945 --> 01:14:17,379
l think you're trying to help.

819
01:14:22,387 --> 01:14:24,685
But l've been wrong before.

820
01:14:30,496 --> 01:14:32,192
Come on, l ain't got all night.

821
01:14:35,569 --> 01:14:37,366
Flass, l have kids to feed.

822
01:14:37,838 --> 01:14:40,000
What, they don't like falafel?

823
01:14:55,425 --> 01:14:57,120
Where were the other drugs going?

824
01:14:58,428 --> 01:15:00,590
l never knew. l don't know.

825
01:15:00,765 --> 01:15:02,961
-l swear to God.
-Swear to me!

826
01:15:08,607 --> 01:15:11,600
l don't-- l don't know.
l never knew. Never.

827
01:15:11,977 --> 01:15:15,311
They went to some guy for a couple days
before they went to the dealers.

828
01:15:15,481 --> 01:15:16,812
Why?

829
01:15:17,483 --> 01:15:21,045
There was something--
Something else in the drugs...

830
01:15:21,221 --> 01:15:22,814
-...something hidden.
-What?

831
01:15:22,990 --> 01:15:26,324
l never went to the drop-off point.
lt was in the Narrows.

832
01:15:26,494 --> 01:15:29,759
-Cops only go there when they're in force.
-Do l look like a cop?

833
01:15:29,931 --> 01:15:31,729
No--

834
01:15:45,349 --> 01:15:47,374
This is the one l'm talking about.

835
01:15:47,685 --> 01:15:49,949
-What's your problem with it?
-lt shouldn't exist.

836
01:15:50,121 --> 01:15:53,990
This ship left Singapore with
246 containers, but arrived with 247.

837
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:56,286
l'm guessing there's something
l'm not supposed to find in there.

838
01:15:56,463 --> 01:16:00,092
Listen, counselor, we don't wanna know
what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.

839
01:16:00,266 --> 01:16:03,599
Things are working
a little differently now. Open it up.

840
01:16:13,215 --> 01:16:14,443
What the hell is this?

841
01:16:57,065 --> 01:17:00,228
lt's you, isn't it?
Everybody's been talking about you.

842
01:17:00,802 --> 01:17:02,565
Get in here!

843
01:17:03,173 --> 01:17:05,300
The other kids won't believe me.

844
01:17:28,401 --> 01:17:30,528
Get rid of all traces.

845
01:17:30,837 --> 01:17:33,738
-Better torch the whole place.
-All right.

846
01:18:09,782 --> 01:18:11,579
Having trouble?

847
01:18:12,285 --> 01:18:14,651
Take a seat. Have a drink.

848
01:18:15,356 --> 01:18:18,587
You look like a man
who takes himself too seriously.

849
01:18:22,296 --> 01:18:25,289
Do you want my opinion?
You need to lighten up.

850
01:19:17,293 --> 01:19:20,991
Alfred, help me.

851
01:19:30,909 --> 01:19:34,277
Blood. Take. Take poison. Blood poison.

852
01:19:34,447 --> 01:19:37,416
Poisonous. Poisonous.

853
01:19:41,754 --> 01:19:43,450
Bruce...

854
01:19:44,726 --> 01:19:45,920
...why eo we fall?

855
01:19:58,005 --> 01:20:01,338
-How long was l out?
-Two days.

856
01:20:01,743 --> 01:20:03,608
lt's your birthday.

857
01:20:04,913 --> 01:20:06,175
Many happy returns.

858
01:20:11,387 --> 01:20:15,222
l've felt these effects before,
but this was so much more potent.

859
01:20:15,392 --> 01:20:19,955
lt was some kind of hallucinogen,
weaponized, in aerosol form.

860
01:20:20,131 --> 01:20:23,100
You have been hanging out
in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.

861
01:20:23,267 --> 01:20:26,328
l called Mr. Fox when your condition
worsened after the first day.

862
01:20:26,505 --> 01:20:31,568
l analyzed your blood, isolating the receptor
compounds and the protein-based catalyst.

863
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:33,507
Am l meant to understand any of that?

864
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:37,076
Not at all. l just wanted you to know
how hard it was.

865
01:20:37,650 --> 01:20:41,348
-Bottom line, l synthesized an antidote.
-Could you make more?

866
01:20:41,522 --> 01:20:44,218
You planning on gassing yourself
again, Mr. Wayne?

867
01:20:44,425 --> 01:20:47,485
Well, you know how it is.
You're out at night, looking for kicks...

868
01:20:47,662 --> 01:20:50,426
...someone's passing around
the weaponized hallucinogens....

869
01:20:50,598 --> 01:20:54,034
l'll bring what l have.
The antidote should inoculate you for now.

870
01:20:54,202 --> 01:20:56,603
Alfred, always a pleasure.

871
01:20:56,772 --> 01:20:58,399
Lucius.

872
01:21:02,913 --> 01:21:05,576
-You sure you don't want to come in?
-l have to get back.

873
01:21:05,749 --> 01:21:07,479
-l wanted to leave this.
-Thank you.

874
01:21:07,652 --> 01:21:09,017
Rachel?

875
01:21:10,388 --> 01:21:13,620
Looks like someone's been
burning the candle at both ends.

876
01:21:13,792 --> 01:21:16,488
-Must've been quite an occasion.
-lt is my birthday.

877
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:20,224
l know. l'm sorry l can't come tonight.
l was just dropping off your present.

878
01:21:20,399 --> 01:21:23,927
-You've got better plans?
-My boss has been missing for two days...

879
01:21:24,105 --> 01:21:27,836
...which means l should probably start
by looking at the bottom of the river.

880
01:21:28,009 --> 01:21:29,499
-Rachel.
-Excuse me.

881
01:21:32,381 --> 01:21:33,609
Rachel Dawes.

882
01:21:34,316 --> 01:21:37,774
Who authorized that? Get Crane down there
now. Don't take no for an answer.

883
01:21:37,954 --> 01:21:41,890
Call Dr. Lehmann, tell him we need our own
assessment on the judge's desk by morning.

884
01:21:42,291 --> 01:21:44,122
-What's wrong?
-lt's Falcone.

885
01:21:44,293 --> 01:21:46,785
Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum
on suicide watch.

886
01:21:46,964 --> 01:21:49,956
You're going to Arkham now?
lt's in the Narrows, Rachel.

887
01:21:51,236 --> 01:21:53,067
You enjoy your party, Bruce.

888
01:21:53,238 --> 01:21:55,968
-Some of us have work to do.
-You be careful.

889
01:21:57,742 --> 01:21:59,335
Happy birthday.

890
01:22:18,734 --> 01:22:20,860
But, Master Wayne,
the guests will be arriving.

891
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:22,628
Keep them happy until l arrive.

892
01:22:22,805 --> 01:22:25,001
Tell them that joke you know.

893
01:23:03,853 --> 01:23:05,547
Having fun?

894
01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:11,285
Bill? Now, what's a big shot like you
doing in a place like this?

895
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:12,723
l need some information.

896
01:23:12,895 --> 01:23:17,698
The Wayne Enterprise 47-B, 1 -ME.

897
01:23:19,002 --> 01:23:20,562
1 -ME.

898
01:23:20,738 --> 01:23:24,401
lt's a microwave emitter. lt was designed
to vaporize an enemy's water supply.

899
01:23:24,576 --> 01:23:28,808
Rumor was they tested dispersing
water-based chemical agents into the air...

900
01:23:28,882 --> 01:23:30,850
...but isn't that illegal?

901
01:23:32,551 --> 01:23:36,784
l want all the information
on the development of this project...

902
01:23:36,957 --> 01:23:40,950
...all data, files, backup disks,
on my desk right away.

903
01:23:41,363 --> 01:23:43,024
Did you lose one?

904
01:23:44,066 --> 01:23:47,695
l'm merging your department
with Archives.

905
01:23:48,905 --> 01:23:50,202
And l am firing you.

906
01:23:52,308 --> 01:23:54,367
Didn't you get the memo?

907
01:24:01,553 --> 01:24:03,214
Scarecrow.

908
01:24:06,491 --> 01:24:08,392
Scarecrow.

909
01:24:11,730 --> 01:24:13,061
Scarecrow.

910
01:24:16,036 --> 01:24:18,266
Miss Dawes, this is most irregular.

911
01:24:18,438 --> 01:24:21,339
l have nothing to add
to the report l filed with the judge.

912
01:24:21,508 --> 01:24:23,773
-l have questions about your report.
-Such as?

913
01:24:23,945 --> 01:24:28,246
lsn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man
who has no history of mental illness...

914
01:24:28,417 --> 01:24:32,012
...to suddenly have a psychotic breakdown
just when he's about to be indicted?

915
01:24:32,187 --> 01:24:36,453
Well, as you can see for yourself, there is
nothing convenient about his symptoms.

916
01:24:41,097 --> 01:24:42,497
-Scarecrow.
-What's ''scarecrow''?

917
01:24:42,967 --> 01:24:46,596
Patients suffering delusional episodes
often focus their paranoia...

918
01:24:46,770 --> 01:24:48,863
...on an external tormentor...

919
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:52,237
...usually one conforming
to Jungian archetypes.

920
01:24:52,477 --> 01:24:54,877
ln this case, a scarecrow.

921
01:24:56,349 --> 01:25:00,479
-He's drugged?
-Psychopharmacology is my primary field.

922
01:25:00,653 --> 01:25:02,052
I'm a strong aevocate.

923
01:25:02,956 --> 01:25:05,151
Outsiee, he was a giant.

924
01:25:05,325 --> 01:25:07,759
ln here, only the mind
can grant you power.

925
01:25:07,928 --> 01:25:09,624
You enjoy the reversal.

926
01:25:09,831 --> 01:25:12,858
l respect the mind's power
over the body.

927
01:25:13,034 --> 01:25:14,558
lt's why l do what l do.

928
01:25:14,737 --> 01:25:19,674
l do what l do to keep thugs like Falcone
behind bars, not in therapy.

929
01:25:19,843 --> 01:25:23,141
l want my own psychiatric consultant
to have full access to Falcone...

930
01:25:23,312 --> 01:25:26,612
...including blood work.
Find out what exactly you put him on.

931
01:25:26,783 --> 01:25:29,274
-First thing tomorrow, then.
-Tonight.

932
01:25:29,453 --> 01:25:32,911
l've already paged Dr. Lehmann
at County General.

933
01:25:34,325 --> 01:25:36,123
As you wish.

934
01:25:41,668 --> 01:25:43,602
This way, please.

935
01:25:43,770 --> 01:25:46,398
There's something
l think you should see.

936
01:25:57,285 --> 01:25:59,914
This is where we make the medicine.

937
01:26:06,729 --> 01:26:10,632
Perhaps you should have some,
clear your head.

938
01:26:35,896 --> 01:26:37,488
Who knows you're here?

939
01:26:38,532 --> 01:26:40,159
Who knows?

940
01:26:47,377 --> 01:26:48,639
He's here.

941
01:26:48,811 --> 01:26:50,073
Who?

942
01:26:50,246 --> 01:26:52,180
The Batman.

943
01:26:53,983 --> 01:26:55,918
-What do we do?
-What anyone does...

944
01:26:56,086 --> 01:26:58,850
...when a prowler comes around.

945
01:26:59,790 --> 01:27:02,351
-Call the police.
-You want the cops here?

946
01:27:02,894 --> 01:27:05,693
At this point, they can't stop us.

947
01:27:05,865 --> 01:27:09,392
But the Batman
has a talent for disruption.

948
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:12,800
Force him outside,
the police will take him down. Go.

949
01:27:12,973 --> 01:27:15,066
-What about her?
-She hasn't got long.

950
01:27:15,242 --> 01:27:19,976
l gave her a concentrated dose.
The mind can only take so much. Now go.

951
01:27:22,483 --> 01:27:24,781
The things they say about him.

952
01:27:24,952 --> 01:27:26,476
Can he really fly?

953
01:27:26,654 --> 01:27:28,714
l heard he can disappear.

954
01:27:28,891 --> 01:27:31,918
Well, we'll find out.

955
01:27:32,194 --> 01:27:33,855
Won't we?

956
01:28:21,184 --> 01:28:23,311
Taste of your own medicine, doctor?

957
01:28:29,962 --> 01:28:31,862
What have you been doing here?

958
01:28:34,933 --> 01:28:37,334
Who are you working for?

959
01:28:41,775 --> 01:28:44,141
Ra's-- Ra's al Ghul.

960
01:28:44,310 --> 01:28:49,181
Ra's al Ghul is dead.
Who are you working for?

961
01:28:49,351 --> 01:28:50,375
Crane.

962
01:28:52,888 --> 01:28:55,824
Dr. Crane isn't here right now.

963
01:28:56,391 --> 01:28:58,291
But if you'd like to make
an appointment....

964
01:29:11,308 --> 01:29:14,210
Batman, put down your weapons
and surrender.

965
01:29:14,946 --> 01:29:16,345
You're surrounded.

966
01:29:21,887 --> 01:29:24,686
-What are you waiting for?
-Backup.

967
01:29:25,424 --> 01:29:27,825
-Backup?
-The Batman's in there.

968
01:29:27,994 --> 01:29:30,156
SWAT's on the way.
But if you wanna go in now...

969
01:29:30,330 --> 01:29:31,855
...l'll be right behind you, sir.

970
01:29:33,367 --> 01:29:34,925
SWAT's on the way.

971
01:29:36,003 --> 01:29:37,301
-Hey.
-Hey.

972
01:30:19,787 --> 01:30:21,516
What's happened to her?

973
01:30:24,193 --> 01:30:27,993
Crane poisoned her with a psychotropic
hallucinogen, a panic-inducing toxin.

974
01:30:29,965 --> 01:30:33,732
-Let me get her down to the medics.
-They can't help her, but l can.

975
01:30:37,642 --> 01:30:39,837
Get her downstairs.
Meet me in the alley.

976
01:30:47,786 --> 01:30:50,687
Crane's been smuggling his toxin
hidden in Falcone's drugs...

977
01:30:50,857 --> 01:30:53,018
...and they're dumping it
into the water supply.

978
01:30:53,526 --> 01:30:55,187
-What was he planning?
-l don't know.

979
01:30:55,396 --> 01:30:56,726
Was he working for Falcone?

980
01:30:57,197 --> 01:30:59,721
He mentioned someone else,
someone worse.

981
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:02,460
She needs the antidote
before the damage is permanent.

982
01:31:02,636 --> 01:31:04,832
-How long does she have?
-Not long.

983
01:31:08,743 --> 01:31:10,540
What is that?

984
01:31:11,914 --> 01:31:14,178
-Backup.
-What the--?

985
01:32:32,407 --> 01:32:33,965
Excuse me.

986
01:32:38,714 --> 01:32:41,980
-How is she?
-She's fading. We gotta go.

987
01:32:43,787 --> 01:32:45,254
l'll get my car.

988
01:32:45,422 --> 01:32:47,254
l brought mine.

989
01:32:47,625 --> 01:32:49,286
Yours?

990
01:32:58,603 --> 01:33:00,434
l've gotta get me one of those.

991
01:33:01,673 --> 01:33:03,801
-He is in a vehicle.
-Make ane color?

992
01:33:04,010 --> 01:33:06,377
lt's a black...

993
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:08,978
...tank.

994
01:33:11,618 --> 01:33:12,983
Stay calm.

995
01:33:13,655 --> 01:33:15,452
You've been poisoned.

996
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:19,491
l'm on him.

997
01:33:27,904 --> 01:33:28,962
Breathe slowly.

998
01:33:39,083 --> 01:33:40,209
Hold on.

999
01:33:54,668 --> 01:33:56,067
-What are you doing?
-Shortcut.

1000
01:34:04,546 --> 01:34:06,344
Air One to groune, block that ramp.

1001
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:12,512
He's got no way off that roof.

1002
01:34:13,923 --> 01:34:17,018
Turn off your engine.
Step away from the car.

1003
01:34:19,364 --> 01:34:22,162
-Trust me.
-Weapons system activatee.

1004
01:34:40,053 --> 01:34:41,351
Who is this guy?

1005
01:34:41,656 --> 01:34:43,385
-Where's he going?
-He's on the roof.

1006
01:34:57,775 --> 01:35:00,004
-What street is he taking?
-He's not on a street.

1007
01:35:00,176 --> 01:35:01,906
He's flying on rooftops.

1008
01:35:41,091 --> 01:35:43,355
At least tell me what it looks like.

1009
01:35:46,396 --> 01:35:47,864
Never mind.

1010
01:35:51,737 --> 01:35:53,102
Got him.

1011
01:36:03,983 --> 01:36:05,576
Coming right up on his butt.

1012
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:32,715
We're tracking suspect vehicle
heaeing west on I- 1 7.

1013
01:36:37,989 --> 01:36:39,685
-Air One to groune.
-l lost him.

1014
01:36:39,858 --> 01:36:41,758
We've lost visual. Exit 9 is blockee.

1015
01:36:41,927 --> 01:36:43,919
We'll loop back to check
the frontage roae.

1016
01:36:44,096 --> 01:36:46,190
Stealth moee activatee.

1017
01:36:46,833 --> 01:36:48,095
Stay with me.

1018
01:36:54,276 --> 01:36:55,766
What--? There he is.

1019
01:37:15,432 --> 01:37:16,899
Just hold on.

1020
01:37:20,872 --> 01:37:22,066
Rachel!

1021
01:37:54,844 --> 01:37:57,177
-They get any of this crap into the mains?
-Yeah.

1022
01:37:57,380 --> 01:38:00,282
Notify the water company.
There's gotta be a way to isolate it.

1023
01:38:00,451 --> 01:38:03,284
No. They put it all in.
They must've been at this for weeks.

1024
01:38:03,454 --> 01:38:07,050
-Gotham's entire water supply is laced with it.
-Why haven't we felt the effects?

1025
01:38:07,225 --> 01:38:09,524
Must be a compound that has
to be absorbed through the lungs.

1026
01:38:19,741 --> 01:38:21,435
How do you feel?

1027
01:38:24,211 --> 01:38:25,679
Where are we?

1028
01:38:26,181 --> 01:38:29,982
-Why did you bring me here?
-lf l hadn't, your mind would now be lost.

1029
01:38:30,152 --> 01:38:32,211
-You were poisoned.
-lt was--

1030
01:38:32,388 --> 01:38:35,983
-lt was Dr. Crane.
-Rest. Gordon has Crane.

1031
01:38:36,158 --> 01:38:38,286
ls Sergeant Gordon your friend?

1032
01:38:38,729 --> 01:38:40,390
l don't have the luxury of friends.

1033
01:38:41,266 --> 01:38:44,599
l'm gonna give you a sedative.
You'll wake up back at home.

1034
01:38:44,769 --> 01:38:48,729
When you do, get these to Gordon,
and Gordon alone. Trust no one.

1035
01:38:48,908 --> 01:38:50,637
-What are they?
-The antidote.

1036
01:38:50,810 --> 01:38:54,143
One for Gordon to inoculate himself,
the other for mass production.

1037
01:38:54,548 --> 01:38:55,845
Mass production?

1038
01:38:56,016 --> 01:38:59,179
Crane was just a pawn.
We need to be ready.

1039
01:39:24,816 --> 01:39:28,274
When you told me your grand plan
for saving Gotham...

1040
01:39:28,854 --> 01:39:31,721
the only thing that stopped me
from calling the men in white coats...

1041
01:39:31,890 --> 01:39:34,358
...was when you said
it wasn't about thrill-seeking.

1042
01:39:34,527 --> 01:39:37,587
-lt's not.
-What would you call that?

1043
01:39:39,465 --> 01:39:42,060
-Damn good television.
-lt's a miracle no one was killed.

1044
01:39:42,136 --> 01:39:45,903
l didn't have time to observe
the rules of the road, Alfred.

1045
01:39:46,074 --> 01:39:49,168
You're getting lost inside
this monster of yours.

1046
01:39:49,344 --> 01:39:53,747
l'm using this monster to help other people,
just like my father did.

1047
01:39:53,948 --> 01:39:55,541
For Thomas Wayne, helping others...

1048
01:39:55,718 --> 01:39:58,585
...wasn't about proving anything
to anyone, including himself.

1049
01:39:59,054 --> 01:40:02,456
lt's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying.

1050
01:40:02,859 --> 01:40:05,419
She's downstairs, sedated.
l need you to take her home.

1051
01:40:05,897 --> 01:40:09,389
Well, we both care for Rachel, but
what you're doing has to be beyond that.

1052
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:12,636
lt can't be personal,
or you're just a vigilante.

1053
01:40:12,805 --> 01:40:14,705
-ls Fox still here?
-Yes, sir.

1054
01:40:14,873 --> 01:40:16,465
We need to send these people away.

1055
01:40:16,642 --> 01:40:19,577
Those are Bruce Wayne's guests.
You have a name to maintain.

1056
01:40:19,746 --> 01:40:21,646
l don't care about my name.

1057
01:40:21,815 --> 01:40:24,978
lt's not just your name, sir.
lt's your father's name.

1058
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:29,086
And it's all that's left of him.

1059
01:40:31,026 --> 01:40:32,584
Don't destroy it.

1060
01:40:48,111 --> 01:40:50,272
-Mr. Earle.
-Happy birthday, Bruce.

1061
01:40:50,447 --> 01:40:51,881
Thank you.

1062
01:40:52,150 --> 01:40:54,208
How did the stock offering go?

1063
01:40:54,451 --> 01:40:55,680
Prices soared.

1064
01:40:55,853 --> 01:40:57,081
Who was buying?

1065
01:40:57,255 --> 01:40:59,189
All kinds of funds and brokerages.

1066
01:40:59,358 --> 01:41:01,053
lt's a bit technical.

1067
01:41:01,226 --> 01:41:02,921
The key thing is...

1068
01:41:03,094 --> 01:41:05,121
...our company's future is secure.

1069
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:07,989
Great.

1070
01:41:21,716 --> 01:41:23,980
A little the worse for wear, l'm afraid.

1071
01:41:29,725 --> 01:41:31,489
What was the plan, Crane?

1072
01:41:31,662 --> 01:41:33,926
How were you gonna get
your toxin into the air?

1073
01:41:34,298 --> 01:41:37,598
Scarecrow. Scarecrow.

1074
01:41:37,769 --> 01:41:39,600
Who were you working for, Crane?

1075
01:41:41,673 --> 01:41:43,869
Oh, it's too late.

1076
01:41:44,477 --> 01:41:46,604
You can't stop it now.

1077
01:41:51,650 --> 01:41:53,175
Here.

1078
01:41:53,352 --> 01:41:55,344
-Happy birthday, Bruce.
-Thank you. Thanks.

1079
01:41:55,522 --> 01:41:58,457
And thank you for that item.

1080
01:41:59,861 --> 01:42:01,088
You're welcome.

1081
01:42:01,262 --> 01:42:04,061
-l know you'll put it to good use.
-l already have.

1082
01:42:04,333 --> 01:42:08,167
How long would it take
to manufacture on a large scale?

1083
01:42:08,705 --> 01:42:09,796
Weeks. Why?

1084
01:42:09,973 --> 01:42:13,136
Somebody's planning to disperse
the toxin using the water supply.

1085
01:42:14,144 --> 01:42:17,238
The water supply won't help you
disperse an inhalant.

1086
01:42:18,181 --> 01:42:19,581
What?

1087
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:22,241
Unless you have a microwave emitter
powerful enough...

1088
01:42:22,420 --> 01:42:25,356
...to vaporize all the water in the mains.

1089
01:42:25,756 --> 01:42:29,056
A microwave emitter like the one
Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.

1090
01:42:29,461 --> 01:42:30,689
Misplaced?

1091
01:42:30,862 --> 01:42:34,320
Earle just fired me for asking
too many questions about it.

1092
01:42:36,370 --> 01:42:39,862
Go back to Wayne Enterprises now
and start making more of that antidote.

1093
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:43,100
The police are gonna need as much
as they can get their hands on.

1094
01:42:43,278 --> 01:42:45,405
My security clearance has been revoked.

1095
01:42:45,579 --> 01:42:47,571
That wouldn't stop a man like you,
would it?

1096
01:42:47,982 --> 01:42:49,711
l suppose not.

1097
01:42:51,754 --> 01:42:56,418
-Bruce, there's somebody you must meet.
-Not now, Mrs. Delane.

1098
01:42:56,592 --> 01:42:59,460
Now, am l pronouncing this right...

1099
01:42:59,629 --> 01:43:02,097
...Mr. Ra's al Ghul?

1100
01:43:07,705 --> 01:43:09,503
You're not Ra's al Ghul.

1101
01:43:11,043 --> 01:43:12,339
l watched him die.

1102
01:43:12,510 --> 01:43:15,571
But is Ra's al Ghul immortal?

1103
01:43:18,318 --> 01:43:20,786
Are his methods supernatural?

1104
01:43:25,326 --> 01:43:29,729
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal
your true identity, Ra's?

1105
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:36,095
Surely a man who spends his nights
scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...

1106
01:43:36,271 --> 01:43:38,296
...wouldn't begrudge me dual identities.

1107
01:43:39,142 --> 01:43:40,939
l saved your life.

1108
01:43:41,110 --> 01:43:43,601
l warned you about compassion, Bruce.

1109
01:43:46,750 --> 01:43:48,980
Your quarrel is with me.

1110
01:43:49,853 --> 01:43:52,345
You let these people go.

1111
01:43:52,590 --> 01:43:55,889
You are welcome to explain
the situation to them.

1112
01:43:58,164 --> 01:43:59,791
Everyone.

1113
01:44:00,566 --> 01:44:02,467
Everybody?

1114
01:44:05,037 --> 01:44:06,903
l....

1115
01:44:07,374 --> 01:44:11,606
l want to thank you all for coming here
tonight and drinking all of my booze.

1116
01:44:13,714 --> 01:44:15,410
No, really.

1117
01:44:16,451 --> 01:44:19,215
There's a thing about being a Wayne...

1118
01:44:19,388 --> 01:44:22,950
...that you're never short of
a few freeloaders, like yourselves...

1119
01:44:23,126 --> 01:44:26,823
...to fill up your mansion with.
So here's to you people. Thank you.

1120
01:44:26,996 --> 01:44:29,591
-That's enough, Bruce.
-l'm not finished.

1121
01:44:29,934 --> 01:44:31,628
To all of you....

1122
01:44:31,802 --> 01:44:36,206
All of you phonies,
all of you two-faced friends...

1123
01:44:36,373 --> 01:44:41,438
...you sycophantic suck-ups
who smile through your teeth at me...

1124
01:44:41,613 --> 01:44:45,209
...please, leave me in peace.

1125
01:44:45,384 --> 01:44:48,012
Please go.

1126
01:44:48,354 --> 01:44:51,756
Stop smiling, it's not a joke.
Please leave.

1127
01:44:51,925 --> 01:44:54,120
The party's over, get out.

1128
01:44:54,294 --> 01:44:57,559
The apple has fallen very far
from the tree, Mr. Wayne.

1129
01:45:02,403 --> 01:45:04,668
He's turning into a jerk.

1130
01:45:10,981 --> 01:45:12,745
Amusing.

1131
01:45:13,049 --> 01:45:16,485
But pointless.
None of these people have long to live.

1132
01:45:16,653 --> 01:45:20,146
Your antics at the asylum
have forced my hand.

1133
01:45:20,324 --> 01:45:22,486
So Crane was working for you.

1134
01:45:22,660 --> 01:45:26,495
His toxin is derived from the organic
compound found in our blue flowers.

1135
01:45:26,833 --> 01:45:28,891
He was able to weaponize it.

1136
01:45:29,067 --> 01:45:31,035
He's not a member of
the League of Shadows?

1137
01:45:31,204 --> 01:45:35,767
Of course not. He thought our plan
was to hold the city to ransom.

1138
01:45:36,477 --> 01:45:41,005
But really, you are gonna release
Crane's poison on the entire city.

1139
01:45:41,181 --> 01:45:45,209
Then watch Gotham tear itself apart
through fear.

1140
01:45:58,101 --> 01:46:00,001
You're gonna eestroy millions of lives.

1141
01:46:00,203 --> 01:46:03,536
Only a cynical man would call
what these people have ''lives,'' Wayne.

1142
01:46:03,707 --> 01:46:05,539
Crime. Despair.

1143
01:46:05,710 --> 01:46:07,804
This is not how man
was supposed to live.

1144
01:46:08,446 --> 01:46:11,575
The League of Shadows has been
a check against human corruption...

1145
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:13,240
...for thousands of years.

1146
01:46:13,420 --> 01:46:17,015
We sacked Rome.
Loaded trade ships with plague rats.

1147
01:46:17,190 --> 01:46:18,589
Burned London to the ground.

1148
01:46:18,758 --> 01:46:21,591
Every time a civilization reaches
the pinnacle of its decadence...

1149
01:46:21,761 --> 01:46:23,730
...we return to restore the balance.

1150
01:46:23,898 --> 01:46:25,490
Gotham isn't beyond saving.

1151
01:46:26,802 --> 01:46:29,497
Give me more time.
There are good people here.

1152
01:46:29,671 --> 01:46:34,837
You are defending a city so corrupt we have
infiltrated every level of its infrastructure.

1153
01:46:45,924 --> 01:46:47,322
Time to play.

1154
01:46:51,496 --> 01:46:54,158
When l found you in that jail,
you were lost.

1155
01:46:54,332 --> 01:46:56,426
But l believed in you.

1156
01:46:56,602 --> 01:47:00,368
l took away your fear,
and l showed you a path.

1157
01:47:00,606 --> 01:47:02,871
You were my greatest student.

1158
01:47:03,142 --> 01:47:06,307
lt should be you standing by my side,
saving the world.

1159
01:47:07,115 --> 01:47:09,743
l'll be standing where l belong.

1160
01:47:10,385 --> 01:47:13,514
Between you and the people of Gotham.

1161
01:47:15,190 --> 01:47:17,784
No one can save Gotham.

1162
01:47:21,131 --> 01:47:25,796
When a forest grows too wild,
a purging fire is inevitable and natural.

1163
01:47:27,003 --> 01:47:31,668
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror
as its greatest city destroys itself.

1164
01:47:32,244 --> 01:47:35,474
The movement back to harmony
will be unstoppable this time.

1165
01:47:35,781 --> 01:47:37,976
-You attacked Gotham before?
-Of course.

1166
01:47:38,216 --> 01:47:40,844
Over the ages our weapons
have grown more sophisticated.

1167
01:47:41,019 --> 01:47:43,921
With Gotham we tried a new one.
Economics.

1168
01:47:44,323 --> 01:47:49,023
But we underestimated certain
of Gotham's citizens...

1169
01:47:49,462 --> 01:47:51,659
...such as your parents.

1170
01:47:55,737 --> 01:47:59,196
Gunned down by one of the very people
they were trying to help.

1171
01:47:59,474 --> 01:48:02,273
Create enough hunger
and everyone becomes a criminal.

1172
01:48:02,445 --> 01:48:04,914
Their deaths galvanized the city
into saving itself...

1173
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:07,776
...and Gotham has limped on ever since.

1174
01:48:07,950 --> 01:48:09,714
We are back to finish the job.

1175
01:48:10,454 --> 01:48:13,686
And this time no misguided idealists
will get in the way.

1176
01:48:13,857 --> 01:48:17,453
Like your father, you lack the courage
to do all that is necessary.

1177
01:48:17,728 --> 01:48:20,630
lf someone stands in the way
of true justice...

1178
01:48:20,799 --> 01:48:24,860
...you simply walk up behind them
and stab them in the heart.

1179
01:48:29,876 --> 01:48:32,038
-l am gonna stop you.
-You never did learn...

1180
01:48:32,213 --> 01:48:34,238
...to mind your surroundings.

1181
01:48:36,450 --> 01:48:38,442
Justice is balance.

1182
01:48:38,619 --> 01:48:40,781
You burned my house
and left me for dead.

1183
01:48:43,458 --> 01:48:45,585
Consider us even.

1184
01:49:02,013 --> 01:49:03,743
No one comes out. Make sure.

1185
01:49:13,627 --> 01:49:15,094
They're all gone?

1186
01:49:15,262 --> 01:49:18,027
-How many from maximum security?
-Every one of them.

1187
01:49:18,199 --> 01:49:19,961
Serial killers, rapists.

1188
01:49:20,201 --> 01:49:23,034
Raise the bridges.
We don't want any getting off the island.

1189
01:49:23,205 --> 01:49:24,638
Yeah, l'll raise the bridges...

1190
01:49:24,806 --> 01:49:29,072
...when l get every available unit out here
to catch the homicidal maniacs...

1191
01:49:29,244 --> 01:49:32,145
-...that are running loose out there.
-Come on!

1192
01:49:55,308 --> 01:49:58,073
l hope you're not a member
of the fire brigade.

1193
01:50:04,084 --> 01:50:06,178
Master Wayne! Master Wayne!

1194
01:50:10,725 --> 01:50:15,095
What is the point of all those pushups
if you can't even lift a bloody log?

1195
01:50:53,541 --> 01:50:55,634
What have l done, Alfred?

1196
01:50:56,646 --> 01:50:58,580
Everything my family...

1197
01:50:58,748 --> 01:51:00,683
...my father, built....

1198
01:51:03,052 --> 01:51:06,989
The Wayne legacy is more
than bricks and mortar, sir.

1199
01:51:07,157 --> 01:51:09,387
l wanted to save Gotham.

1200
01:51:10,328 --> 01:51:12,228
l failed.

1201
01:51:13,432 --> 01:51:14,728
Why do we fall, sir?

1202
01:51:17,902 --> 01:51:21,361
So that we can learn
to pick ourselves up.

1203
01:51:23,842 --> 01:51:26,004
You still haven't given up on me?

1204
01:51:27,914 --> 01:51:29,404
Never.

1205
01:51:30,451 --> 01:51:31,782
Down!

1206
01:51:31,952 --> 01:51:34,887
Harassment! l see harassment!

1207
01:51:35,055 --> 01:51:37,081
Maybe you'd like to see
some excessive force?

1208
01:51:37,259 --> 01:51:39,193
Madman with a gun.

1209
01:51:40,428 --> 01:51:43,796
With resieents furious at
the unpreceeentee show of police strength...

1210
01:51:43,966 --> 01:51:47,300
-...to roune up the inmates....
-We're about to raise these bridges.

1211
01:51:47,471 --> 01:51:51,065
Officer, l am a Gotham City
district attorney. Let me pass.

1212
01:51:58,483 --> 01:52:00,781
-Just shut up!
-Hey, Flass, cool it!

1213
01:52:00,952 --> 01:52:02,215
Hold these people back.

1214
01:52:02,388 --> 01:52:05,380
Hey, Gordon. Somebody here to see you.

1215
01:52:05,558 --> 01:52:07,924
-What are you doing here?
-Our friend sent me with this.

1216
01:52:08,093 --> 01:52:09,618
lt counteracts Crane's toxin.

1217
01:52:09,795 --> 01:52:11,263
Hopefully you won't need it.

1218
01:52:11,431 --> 01:52:14,595
Not unless he's got some way
of getting that crap into the air.

1219
01:52:15,736 --> 01:52:18,204
All right, last one across.

1220
01:52:18,872 --> 01:52:22,809
Come on, people, they want this bridge up
in no more than three minutes!

1221
01:52:23,011 --> 01:52:26,412
Better get you off the island before
they raise the bridges. Patrolman!

1222
01:52:27,015 --> 01:52:28,005
Go!

1223
01:52:54,847 --> 01:52:56,679
l can't find my mom.

1224
01:52:56,984 --> 01:52:58,508
Hey!

1225
01:53:06,895 --> 01:53:08,625
What the hell are you doing?

1226
01:53:10,132 --> 01:53:11,724
Gentlemen...

1227
01:53:12,134 --> 01:53:14,694
...time to spread the word.

1228
01:53:16,405 --> 01:53:17,805
And the word is...

1229
01:53:19,075 --> 01:53:20,804
...panic.

1230
01:53:44,905 --> 01:53:46,497
Jesus. The pressure, it's spiking.

1231
01:53:47,509 --> 01:53:48,840
Right there.

1232
01:53:49,144 --> 01:53:51,408
That water main
is right under the Narrows.

1233
01:54:08,333 --> 01:54:09,891
lt's okay.

1234
01:54:42,739 --> 01:54:44,297
This is Commissioner Loeb.

1235
01:54:44,475 --> 01:54:46,169
Come on, somebody talk to me.

1236
01:54:46,342 --> 01:54:47,810
Come on!

1237
01:55:07,467 --> 01:55:09,526
Loeb, Loeb. This is Gordon.

1238
01:55:09,803 --> 01:55:11,169
What the hell is going on?

1239
01:55:11,339 --> 01:55:14,775
We need reinforcements.
TAC teams, SWAT, riot cops!

1240
01:55:14,942 --> 01:55:19,175
Gordon! All the city's riot police
are on the island with you!

1241
01:55:19,348 --> 01:55:21,373
Well, they're completely incapacitatee!

1242
01:55:21,683 --> 01:55:25,643
lt's okay, it's okay.
No one's gonna hurt you.

1243
01:55:26,523 --> 01:55:28,150
Of course they are!

1244
01:55:28,358 --> 01:55:31,327
-Crane?
-No. Scarecrow.

1245
01:55:33,096 --> 01:55:34,496
Gordon...

1246
01:55:34,665 --> 01:55:36,930
...there's nobody left to send in.

1247
01:55:38,469 --> 01:55:40,165
So l'm on my own?

1248
01:55:44,277 --> 01:55:45,938
The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces.

1249
01:55:46,111 --> 01:55:48,706
This is just the beginning.
lf they hit the whole city...

1250
01:55:48,881 --> 01:55:51,611
...there's nothing to stop Gotham
tearing itself apart.

1251
01:55:51,784 --> 01:55:53,684
-How are they gonna do that?
-The train.

1252
01:55:53,853 --> 01:55:57,688
The monorail follows the water mains
to the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.

1253
01:55:57,858 --> 01:55:59,588
If the machine gets to the station...

1254
01:55:59,761 --> 01:56:03,219
...it'll cause a chain reaction
that'll vaporize the city's water supply.

1255
01:56:03,399 --> 01:56:04,990
Covering Gotham in this poison.

1256
01:56:05,166 --> 01:56:08,364
l'm gonna stop him from loading
that train, but l may need your help.

1257
01:56:08,537 --> 01:56:10,335
-What do you need?
-Can you drive stick?

1258
01:56:16,613 --> 01:56:18,274
There you are!

1259
01:56:18,448 --> 01:56:20,440
There is nothing to fear...

1260
01:56:20,617 --> 01:56:22,348
...but fear itself!

1261
01:56:23,422 --> 01:56:25,754
l am here to help!

1262
01:56:56,959 --> 01:56:59,121
Batman will save us. He'll come.

1263
01:57:04,334 --> 01:57:06,235
-He'll come.
-Don't peek.

1264
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:18,247
This is Gordon.
Prepare to lower the bridge.

1265
01:57:24,125 --> 01:57:26,251
l told you he'd come.

1266
01:57:31,265 --> 01:57:32,893
Wait.

1267
01:57:33,870 --> 01:57:35,461
You could die.

1268
01:57:35,637 --> 01:57:36,935
At least tell me your name.

1269
01:57:42,345 --> 01:57:44,540
lt's not who l am underneath...

1270
01:57:45,516 --> 01:57:49,316
...but what l do that defines me.

1271
01:57:50,187 --> 01:57:51,485
Bruce?

1272
01:58:25,195 --> 01:58:28,563
Well, well. You took my advice
about theatricality a bit literally.

1273
01:58:28,733 --> 01:58:31,201
-lt ends here.
-For you and the police, maybe.

1274
01:58:31,369 --> 01:58:33,701
My fight, however,
lies with the rest of Gotham.

1275
01:58:33,871 --> 01:58:37,238
Now, if you'll excuse me,
l have a city to destroy.

1276
01:58:37,408 --> 01:58:41,106
-l can't beat two of your pawns?
-As you wish.

1277
01:58:53,927 --> 01:58:56,226
GPS online.

1278
01:59:03,071 --> 01:59:05,302
In 100 yares.

1279
01:59:36,177 --> 01:59:37,474
Gentlemen.

1280
02:00:04,876 --> 02:00:07,106
Who the hell authorized this?

1281
02:00:17,657 --> 02:00:19,750
Distance to Wayne Tower, three miles.

1282
02:00:27,001 --> 02:00:29,630
The pressure's moving along the mains,
blowing the pipes.

1283
02:00:29,804 --> 02:00:31,171
lf that pressure reaches us...

1284
02:00:31,341 --> 02:00:34,367
...the water supply right across
the whole city is gonna blow!

1285
02:00:44,822 --> 02:00:47,724
At the next intersection, turn right.

1286
02:01:12,420 --> 02:01:13,854
You will never learn.

1287
02:01:21,465 --> 02:01:22,454
Sorry.

1288
02:01:26,436 --> 02:01:29,406
-Familiar. Don't you have anything new?
-How about this?!

1289
02:01:46,192 --> 02:01:48,491
You have arrivee at Wayne Tower.

1290
02:02:01,777 --> 02:02:03,039
Evacuate the building.

1291
02:02:03,246 --> 02:02:05,738
We're on top of the main hub
and it's gonna blow.

1292
02:02:14,658 --> 02:02:16,854
Weapons system activatee.

1293
02:02:20,932 --> 02:02:21,922
Nice ride.

1294
02:02:37,219 --> 02:02:38,207
Armee.

1295
02:02:50,166 --> 02:02:51,633
Don't be afraid, Bruce.

1296
02:02:54,438 --> 02:02:55,803
Come on. Come on.

1297
02:03:00,579 --> 02:03:02,639
You are just an ordinary man in a cape.

1298
02:03:02,814 --> 02:03:06,683
That's why you couldn't fight injustice,
that's why you can't stop this train.

1299
02:03:06,852 --> 02:03:09,446
Who said anything about stopping it?

1300
02:03:14,863 --> 02:03:16,386
Yes!

1301
02:03:24,574 --> 02:03:28,010
You never learned
to mind your surroundings!

1302
02:03:35,819 --> 02:03:38,310
Have you finally learned to do
what is necessary?

1303
02:03:38,622 --> 02:03:40,921
l won't kill you...

1304
02:03:45,363 --> 02:03:47,525
...but l don't have to save you.

1305
02:05:02,687 --> 02:05:05,746
-The meeting's already started.
-What meeting?

1306
02:05:10,027 --> 02:05:12,929
Fox, l seem to remember firing you.

1307
02:05:13,465 --> 02:05:15,024
You did.

1308
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:17,294
l got another job.

1309
02:05:18,137 --> 02:05:19,570
Yours.

1310
02:05:20,039 --> 02:05:21,735
On whose authority?

1311
02:05:22,375 --> 02:05:24,310
Batman may have made the front page...

1312
02:05:24,511 --> 02:05:27,412
...but Bruce Wayne
got pushed to page eight.

1313
02:05:34,290 --> 02:05:35,278
Bruce Wayne.

1314
02:05:35,458 --> 02:05:39,224
What makes you think you can decide
who's running Wayne Enterprises?

1315
02:05:39,395 --> 02:05:42,126
-The fact that l'm the owner.
-What are you talking about?

1316
02:05:42,398 --> 02:05:44,299
The company went public a week ago.

1317
02:05:44,468 --> 02:05:45,935
And l bought most of the shares.

1318
02:05:46,304 --> 02:05:49,762
Through various charitable founeations
ane trusts ane so forth.

1319
02:05:49,941 --> 02:05:53,139
Look, it's all a bit technical,
but the important thing...

1320
02:05:53,378 --> 02:05:56,678
...is that my company's future is secure.

1321
02:05:57,049 --> 02:05:58,448
Right, Mr. Fox?

1322
02:05:58,617 --> 02:06:00,448
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.

1323
02:06:02,655 --> 02:06:04,247
Didn't you get the memo?

1324
02:06:23,178 --> 02:06:26,376
-l'm sorry l didn't tell you, Rachel.
-No. No, Bruce...

1325
02:06:26,582 --> 02:06:27,947
...l'm sorry.

1326
02:06:28,818 --> 02:06:31,481
The day that Chill died, l....

1327
02:06:33,358 --> 02:06:34,985
l said terrible things.

1328
02:06:35,492 --> 02:06:37,256
But true things.

1329
02:06:37,896 --> 02:06:39,728
l was a coward with a gun...

1330
02:06:39,899 --> 02:06:43,664
...and justice is about more than revenge,
so thank you.

1331
02:06:44,738 --> 02:06:47,400
l never stopped thinking about you.

1332
02:06:48,875 --> 02:06:50,501
About us.

1333
02:06:51,144 --> 02:06:53,113
And when l heard you were back, l....

1334
02:06:53,947 --> 02:06:56,142
l started to hope.

1335
02:07:20,212 --> 02:07:22,908
But then l found out about your mask.

1336
02:07:24,115 --> 02:07:26,913
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.

1337
02:07:27,552 --> 02:07:29,214
No. This...

1338
02:07:30,389 --> 02:07:32,085
...is your mask.

1339
02:07:34,061 --> 02:07:37,622
Your real face is the one
that criminals now fear.

1340
02:07:38,465 --> 02:07:40,434
The man l loved...

1341
02:07:41,169 --> 02:07:42,602
...the man who vanished...

1342
02:07:43,838 --> 02:07:45,965
...he never came back at all.

1343
02:07:50,479 --> 02:07:53,108
But maybe he's still
out there somewhere.

1344
02:07:55,318 --> 02:07:58,981
Maybe someday,
when Gotham no longer needs Batman...

1345
02:08:00,057 --> 02:08:02,024
...l'll see him again.

1346
02:08:13,072 --> 02:08:15,973
-Proved me wrong, you know.
-About what?

1347
02:08:18,811 --> 02:08:21,280
Your father would be very proud of you.

1348
02:08:21,515 --> 02:08:23,107
Just like me.

1349
02:08:50,114 --> 02:08:51,980
What will you do?

1350
02:08:53,385 --> 02:08:54,943
Rebuild it.

1351
02:08:55,821 --> 02:08:58,187
Just the way it was, brick for brick.

1352
02:09:05,031 --> 02:09:06,293
Just the way it was, sir?

1353
02:09:08,402 --> 02:09:09,630
Yeah, why?

1354
02:09:09,805 --> 02:09:12,638
l thought this might be
a good opportunity for...

1355
02:09:12,808 --> 02:09:15,276
...improving the foundations.

1356
02:09:15,444 --> 02:09:18,413
-ln the southeast corner?
-Precisely, sir.

1357
02:09:34,099 --> 02:09:36,933
-Nice.
-l couldn't find any mob bosses.

1358
02:09:37,869 --> 02:09:40,599
-Well, sergeant?
-lt's ''lieutenant'' now.

1359
02:09:40,940 --> 02:09:42,431
You really started something.

1360
02:09:42,642 --> 02:09:44,610
Bent cops running scared.

1361
02:09:44,777 --> 02:09:46,211
Hope on the streets.

1362
02:09:46,446 --> 02:09:50,041
-But?
-The Narrows is lost.

1363
02:09:50,585 --> 02:09:54,453
And we still haven't picked up Crane
or half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.

1364
02:09:55,089 --> 02:09:56,716
We will.

1365
02:09:56,959 --> 02:09:58,620
We can bring Gotham back.

1366
02:09:58,793 --> 02:10:01,285
-What about escalation?
-Escalation?

1367
02:10:01,463 --> 02:10:05,764
We start carrying semiautomatics,
they buy automatics.

1368
02:10:05,935 --> 02:10:10,304
We start wearing Kevlar,
they buy armor-piercing rounds.

1369
02:10:10,473 --> 02:10:13,739
-And?
-And you're wearing a mask...

1370
02:10:14,178 --> 02:10:16,112
...and jumping off rooftops.

1371
02:10:17,481 --> 02:10:19,507
Now, take this guy.

1372
02:10:19,751 --> 02:10:21,810
Armed robbery, double homicide.

1373
02:10:21,988 --> 02:10:25,218
Got a taste for the theatrical, like you.

1374
02:10:25,491 --> 02:10:27,425
Leaves a calling card.

1375
02:10:33,300 --> 02:10:35,131
l'll look into it.

1376
02:10:38,606 --> 02:10:40,130
l never said thank you.

1377
02:10:45,181 --> 02:10:47,240
And you'll never have to.

1378
02:10:48,241 --> 02:10:53,241
