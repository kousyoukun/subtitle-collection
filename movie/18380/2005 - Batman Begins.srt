1
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:48,488
Rachel, let me see.

2
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:57,325
- Can I see?
- Finders keepers. And I found it.

3
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,972
In my garden.

4
00:01:00,613 --> 00:01:02,365
Finders keepers.

5
00:01:09,053 --> 00:01:10,486
Bruce?

6
00:01:15,293 --> 00:01:16,931
Bruce?

7
00:01:19,173 --> 00:01:21,528
Mom! Mr. Alfred!

8
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:45,603
Did you have dream?

9
00:01:46,053 --> 00:01:47,850
Nightmare.

10
00:01:52,053 --> 00:01:53,452
Worse than this place?

11
00:02:14,573 --> 00:02:16,450
They are going to fight you.

12
00:02:16,813 --> 00:02:18,371
- Again?
- Until they kill you.

13
00:02:20,493 --> 00:02:22,211
Can they kill me before breakfast?

14
00:02:24,493 --> 00:02:27,212
You are in hell, little man.

15
00:02:30,373 --> 00:02:33,046
And I am the devil.

16
00:02:36,293 --> 00:02:37,692
You're not the devil.

17
00:02:37,727 --> 00:02:39,172
You're practice.

18
00:03:20,853 --> 00:03:22,046
Solitary.

19
00:03:22,081 --> 00:03:24,084
- Why?
- For protection.

20
00:03:24,773 --> 00:03:27,003
- I don't need protection.
- Protection for them.

21
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:32,444
Get in.

22
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:38,368
Are you so
desperate to fight criminals...

23
00:03:38,403 --> 00:03:40,962
...that you lock yourself in
to take them on one at a time?

24
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:45,887
Actually, there were seven of them.

25
00:03:45,922 --> 00:03:48,248
I counted six, Mr. Wayne.

26
00:03:51,853 --> 00:03:53,012
How do you know my name?

27
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:56,125
The world is too small for someone
like Bruce Wayne to disappear...

28
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,523
...no matter how deep
he chooses to sink.

29
00:03:58,558 --> 00:03:59,773
Who are you?

30
00:03:59,808 --> 00:04:03,010
My name is merely Ducard,
but I speak for Ra's al Ghul...

31
00:04:03,045 --> 00:04:06,643
...a man greatly feared
by the criminal underworld.

32
00:04:06,678 --> 00:04:08,326
A man who can offer you a path.

33
00:04:09,213 --> 00:04:11,602
What makes you think I need a path?

34
00:04:11,973 --> 00:04:14,452
Someone like you
is only here by choice.

35
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,928
You have been exploring
the criminal fraternity...

36
00:04:16,963 --> 00:04:19,448
...but whatever
your original intentions...

37
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:23,330
...you have become truly lost.

38
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:28,407
And what path can Ra's al Ghul offer?

39
00:04:28,442 --> 00:04:32,447
The path of a man
who shares his hatred of evil...

40
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:35,685
...and wishes to serve true justice.

41
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:38,169
The path of the League of Shadows.

42
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:43,293
- You're vigilantes.
- No, no, no.

43
00:04:43,328 --> 00:04:47,486
A vigilante is just a man lost in
the scramble for his own gratification.

44
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:51,168
He can be destroyed or locked up.

45
00:04:52,453 --> 00:04:57,083
But if you make yourself more
than just a man...

46
00:04:57,118 --> 00:05:00,131
...if you devote yourself to an ideal...

47
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,682
...and if they can't stop you...

48
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,408
...then you become
something else entirely.

49
00:05:07,013 --> 00:05:08,492
Which is?

50
00:05:08,973 --> 00:05:11,806
Legend, Mr. Wayne.

51
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:14,616
Tomorrow, you will be released.

52
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:18,044
If you are bored of brawling with thieves
and want to achieve something...

53
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,569
...there is a rare blue flower
that grows on the eastern slopes.

54
00:05:21,604 --> 00:05:23,290
Pick one of these flowers.

55
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:26,291
If you can carry it
to the top of the mountain...

56
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,291
...you may find what you were
looking for in the first place.

57
00:05:29,326 --> 00:05:32,092
And what was I looking for?

58
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,610
Only you can know that.

59
00:06:39,573 --> 00:06:43,486
You turn back. You go back.

60
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:50,249
Ra's al Ghul?

61
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:01,566
Wait.

62
00:08:04,081 --> 00:08:05,891
What are you seeking?

63
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:08,484
I seek...

64
00:08:09,973 --> 00:08:12,123
...the means to fight injustice.

65
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,529
To turn fear...

66
00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:17,572
...against those
who prey on the fearful.

67
00:08:38,373 --> 00:08:41,331
To manipulate the fears in others...

68
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:45,409
...you must first master your own.

69
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:47,651
Are you ready to begin?

70
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:50,966
I can... I can barely stand.

71
00:08:51,001 --> 00:08:53,403
Death does not wait
for you to be ready!

72
00:08:53,438 --> 00:08:56,610
Death is not considerate or fair!

73
00:08:57,093 --> 00:09:01,530
And make no mistake,
here you face death.

74
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,527
Tiger.

75
00:09:08,093 --> 00:09:09,811
Jujitsu.

76
00:09:11,933 --> 00:09:12,922
Panther.

77
00:09:16,293 --> 00:09:18,523
You're skilled. But this is not a dance.

78
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:25,252
And you are afraid.

79
00:09:28,093 --> 00:09:29,890
But not of me.

80
00:09:33,213 --> 00:09:35,602
Tell us, Mr. Wayne...

81
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:42,970
...what do you fear?

82
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:53,086
Bruce?

83
00:09:55,653 --> 00:09:58,042
It's okay. It's okay.

84
00:09:58,077 --> 00:09:59,646
You'll be okay.

85
00:09:59,893 --> 00:10:02,167
Will we be needing
an ambulance, Master Wayne?

86
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:05,126
No, I'll set the bone
and take him for an x-ray later.

87
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:06,487
Very good, sir.

88
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:10,482
- I'm very sorry, sir. I've told...
Don't worry. It's fine.

89
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,848
Took quite a fall,
didn't we, Master Bruce?

90
00:10:14,883 --> 00:10:16,093
And why do we fall?

91
00:10:16,128 --> 00:10:19,251
So we can learn to pick ourselves up.

92
00:10:22,853 --> 00:10:25,606
Just a little fall.
It's just a small fracture.

93
00:10:34,213 --> 00:10:35,965
The bats again?

94
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,049
You know why they attacked you,
don't you?

95
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:44,445
- They were afraid of you.
- Afraid of me?

96
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,223
All creatures feel fear.

97
00:10:46,258 --> 00:10:47,932
Even the scary ones?

98
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:49,930
Especially the scary ones.

99
00:10:50,293 --> 00:10:52,011
I got something to show you.

100
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:59,330
- You think your mother will like them?
- Yeah.

101
00:10:59,973 --> 00:11:02,043
- I think it's time to get up.
- Maybe.

102
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,771
No going back to bed.

103
00:11:06,853 --> 00:11:08,854
Did you build this train, Dad?

104
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:12,989
Gotham's been good to our family,
but the city's been suffering.

105
00:11:13,024 --> 00:11:17,054
People less fortunate than us
have been enduring very hard times.

106
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:21,041
So we built a new, cheap, public
transportation system to unite the city.

107
00:11:21,076 --> 00:11:22,851
And at the center...

108
00:11:22,886 --> 00:11:24,730
...Wayne Tower.

109
00:11:24,765 --> 00:11:27,845
Is that where you work?
- No, I work at the hospital.

110
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,925
I leave the running of our company
to much better men.

111
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,081
- Better?
- Well...

112
00:11:33,116 --> 00:11:35,203
...more interested men.

113
00:12:29,293 --> 00:12:30,646
Can we go?

114
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:34,366
Please.

115
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:36,889
Okay. Let's go.

116
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:48,486
- What's wrong, Bruce?
- No, no. It was me.

117
00:12:48,521 --> 00:12:50,654
I just needed some fresh air.

118
00:12:50,689 --> 00:12:53,890
A little bit of opera goes a long way.
Right, Bruce?

119
00:12:56,413 --> 00:12:59,007
Come on. Let's go.

120
00:13:04,253 --> 00:13:05,872
Wallets, jewelry. Come on, fast.

121
00:13:05,907 --> 00:13:07,492
That's fine.
Fast.

122
00:13:07,527 --> 00:13:09,086
Take it easy.

123
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:11,212
Take it easy.

124
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:13,372
Here you go.

125
00:13:16,013 --> 00:13:18,732
It's fine. It's fine.

126
00:13:19,573 --> 00:13:22,530
Now just take it and go.

127
00:13:22,565 --> 00:13:24,007
- I said, jewelry.
Hey...

128
00:13:26,362 --> 00:13:27,682
Thomas!

129
00:13:35,373 --> 00:13:36,931
Bruce.

130
00:13:39,453 --> 00:13:40,772
It's okay.

131
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:45,451
Don't be afraid.

132
00:14:15,973 --> 00:14:17,691
Is this your father's?

133
00:14:19,173 --> 00:14:21,209
It's okay.

134
00:14:22,373 --> 00:14:23,931
Come here.

135
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,649
There you go.

136
00:14:31,653 --> 00:14:33,564
It's okay.

137
00:14:35,253 --> 00:14:37,084
It's okay.

138
00:14:40,933 --> 00:14:42,366
Gordon.

139
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:51,646
Hey.

140
00:14:52,253 --> 00:14:53,402
Good news.

141
00:14:54,813 --> 00:14:56,610
We got him, son.

142
00:15:16,453 --> 00:15:18,212
You're in excellent hands.

143
00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:19,936
We'll be watching the empire.

144
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:23,011
When you grow up,
it'll be waiting for you.

145
00:15:38,373 --> 00:15:41,365
I thought I might prepare a little supper.

146
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,324
- Very well.
- Alfred?

147
00:15:52,133 --> 00:15:54,044
- Yes, Master Bruce?
- It was my fault, Alfred.

148
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,770
- I made them leave the theater.
- No.

149
00:15:55,805 --> 00:15:58,885
- If I hadn't gotten scared...
- It was nothing that you did.

150
00:15:59,973 --> 00:16:03,170
It was him, and him alone.

151
00:16:03,653 --> 00:16:05,086
Do you understand?

152
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:11,005
I miss them, Alfred.
I miss them so much.

153
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,084
So do I, Master Bruce.

154
00:16:15,413 --> 00:16:16,607
So do I.

155
00:16:18,653 --> 00:16:21,531
And do you still feel
responsible for your parents' death?

156
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:23,684
My anger outweighs my guilt.

157
00:16:24,413 --> 00:16:25,732
Come.

158
00:16:30,213 --> 00:16:32,772
You have learned to bury
your guilt with anger.

159
00:16:32,807 --> 00:16:35,885
I will teach you to confront it
and to face the truth.

160
00:16:38,293 --> 00:16:43,048
You know how to fight six men.
We can teach you how to engage 600.

161
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,015
You know how to disappear.

162
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,329
We can teach you
to become truly invisible.

163
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:51,531
Invisible?

164
00:16:55,373 --> 00:16:59,810
The ninja understands that invisibility
is a matter of patience and agility.

165
00:17:12,253 --> 00:17:13,891
Always mind your surroundings.

166
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:19,049
Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.

167
00:17:20,493 --> 00:17:22,608
- As weapons?
- Or distractions.

168
00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:25,043
Theatricality and deception
are powerful agents.

169
00:17:25,493 --> 00:17:28,405
You must become more than just a man
in the mind of your opponent.

170
00:17:30,606 --> 00:17:32,615
Who is he?
- He was a farmer.

171
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,930
Then he tried to take his neighbor's land
and became a murderer.

172
00:17:35,965 --> 00:17:38,288
- Now he is a prisoner.
- What'll happen to him?

173
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,727
Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated.

174
00:17:40,762 --> 00:17:44,721
Criminals thrive on the indulgence
of society's understanding.

175
00:17:48,613 --> 00:17:51,332
Your parents' death was not your fault.

176
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,527
It was your father's.

177
00:18:20,573 --> 00:18:23,292
Anger does not change the fact
that your father failed to act.

178
00:18:23,327 --> 00:18:25,569
- The man had a gun.
- Would that stop you?

179
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,447
I've had training.

180
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,405
The training is nothing!

181
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,165
Will is everything!

182
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:38,485
The will to act.

183
00:18:47,853 --> 00:18:49,047
Yield.

184
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,651
You haven't beaten me.

185
00:18:50,686 --> 00:18:53,447
You have sacrificed sure footing
for a killing stroke.

186
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:02,491
Rub your chest.

187
00:19:02,973 --> 00:19:05,726
Your arms will take care of themselves.

188
00:19:08,293 --> 00:19:09,851
You are stronger than your father.

189
00:19:10,493 --> 00:19:12,016
You didn't know my father.

190
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,373
But I know the rage that drives you.

191
00:19:14,408 --> 00:19:16,950
That impossible anger
strangling the grief...

192
00:19:16,985 --> 00:19:19,493
...until the memory
of your loved one is just...

193
00:19:19,528 --> 00:19:21,529
...poison in your veins.

194
00:19:21,564 --> 00:19:26,011
And one day, you catch yourself wishing
the person you loved had never existed...

195
00:19:27,373 --> 00:19:29,728
...so you'd be spared your pain.

196
00:19:32,613 --> 00:19:35,844
I wasn't always here in the mountains.

197
00:19:37,413 --> 00:19:39,369
Once, I had a wife.

198
00:19:40,293 --> 00:19:42,124
My great love.

199
00:19:43,253 --> 00:19:45,254
She was taken from me.

200
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:48,525
Like you, I was forced to learn
there are those without decency...

201
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,844
...who must be fought
without hesitation, without pity.

202
00:19:53,573 --> 00:19:55,803
Your anger gives you great power.

203
00:19:56,293 --> 00:19:59,683
But if you let it, it will destroy you...

204
00:20:00,213 --> 00:20:01,407
...as it almost did me.

205
00:20:02,053 --> 00:20:04,886
- What stopped it?
- Vengeance.

206
00:20:05,093 --> 00:20:06,845
That's no help to me.

207
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,730
Why, Bruce?

208
00:20:08,765 --> 00:20:11,493
Why could you not
avenge your parents?

209
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:18,483
Will you be heading back to Princeton
after the hearing, sir...

210
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:21,213
...or can I persuade you to stay on
for a day or two?

211
00:20:21,248 --> 00:20:23,454
I'm not heading back at all.

212
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,644
You don't like it there?
- I like it fine.

213
00:20:26,013 --> 00:20:28,686
They just don't feel the same way.

214
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:32,968
- I've prepared the master bedroom.
- No.

215
00:20:33,003 --> 00:20:34,451
My room will be fine.

216
00:20:34,486 --> 00:20:37,292
With all due respect, sir,
Wayne Manor is your house.

217
00:20:37,327 --> 00:20:39,170
No, Alfred, it's my father's house.

218
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:41,408
- Your father is dead.
- This place is a mausoleum.

219
00:20:41,443 --> 00:20:44,490
If I have my way, I'll pull
the damn thing down brick by brick.

220
00:20:44,525 --> 00:20:48,606
This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered
six generations of your family.

221
00:20:48,641 --> 00:20:51,367
Why do you give a damn, Alfred?
It's not your family.

222
00:20:52,173 --> 00:20:55,882
I give a damn because a good man
once made me responsible...

223
00:20:56,533 --> 00:20:58,603
...for what was most precious to him...

224
00:20:58,638 --> 00:21:00,923
...in the whole world.

225
00:21:02,813 --> 00:21:06,203
Miss Dawes has offered
to drive you to the hearing.

226
00:21:06,238 --> 00:21:08,294
She probably hopes
to talk you out of going.

227
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:11,630
Should I just bury the past
out there with my parents, Alfred?

228
00:21:11,665 --> 00:21:14,896
I wouldn't presume to tell you
what to do with your past, sir.

229
00:21:14,931 --> 00:21:18,972
Just know that there are those of us who
care about what you do with your future.

230
00:21:20,293 --> 00:21:21,726
Haven't given up on me yet?

231
00:21:22,373 --> 00:21:23,806
Never.

232
00:22:10,373 --> 00:22:14,207
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk
on the top shelf.

233
00:22:14,413 --> 00:22:16,290
Hasn't he noticed
you're tall enough to reach now?

234
00:22:16,613 --> 00:22:18,057
Old habits die hard, I guess.

235
00:22:18,092 --> 00:22:20,562
- Never used to stop us anyway.
- No, it didn't.

236
00:22:20,597 --> 00:22:22,530
How's your mom?

237
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:25,083
She misses this place.

238
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:27,966
So do I.

239
00:22:28,373 --> 00:22:29,532
Yeah.

240
00:22:29,567 --> 00:22:32,611
But it's nothing without the people
who made it what it was.

241
00:22:32,646 --> 00:22:35,616
- Now there's only Alfred.
- And you.

242
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:39,203
- I'm not staying, Rachel.
- You're just back for the hearing.

243
00:22:42,693 --> 00:22:46,686
Bruce, I don't suppose there's any way
to convince you not to come.

244
00:22:47,013 --> 00:22:50,369
Someone at this proceeding...

245
00:22:51,013 --> 00:22:53,151
...should stand for my parents.

246
00:22:53,186 --> 00:22:55,254
We all loved your parents, Bruce.

247
00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:58,525
- What Chill did is unforgivable.
- Then why is your boss letting him go?

248
00:22:59,853 --> 00:23:02,935
In prison, he shared a cell
with Carmine Falcone.

249
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:06,648
He learned things, and he will testify
in exchange for early parole.

250
00:23:06,683 --> 00:23:09,373
Rachel, this man killed my parents.

251
00:23:11,293 --> 00:23:12,896
I cannot let that pass.

252
00:23:12,931 --> 00:23:15,846
And I need you
to understand that, please.

253
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:18,682
Okay.

254
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:22,949
The depression hit working
people, like Mr. Chill, hardest of all.

255
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:26,165
His crime was appalling, yes,
but it was motivated not by greed...

256
00:23:26,493 --> 00:23:28,050
...but by desperation.

257
00:23:28,085 --> 00:23:32,007
Given the 14 years served, as well as
his extraordinary level of cooperation...

258
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:34,687
...with one of this office's
most important investigations...

259
00:23:34,722 --> 00:23:37,845
...we strongly endorse his petition
for early release.

260
00:23:38,813 --> 00:23:41,008
Mr. Chill?

261
00:23:44,453 --> 00:23:46,045
Your Honor...

262
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:49,885
...not a day goes by that I don't wish
I could take back what I did.

263
00:23:52,413 --> 00:23:55,530
Sure, I was desperate,
like a lot of people back then...

264
00:23:55,565 --> 00:23:57,923
...but that don't change what I did.

265
00:24:01,413 --> 00:24:05,884
I gather there is a member
of the Wayne family here today.

266
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,248
Has he got anything to say?

267
00:24:21,773 --> 00:24:25,083
He's coming out the side!
He's coming out the side, guys!

268
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:35,601
Bruce Wayne!

269
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:39,487
Joe! Hey, Joe!

270
00:24:39,522 --> 00:24:40,642
Falcone says hi.

271
00:24:51,013 --> 00:24:52,526
Come on, Bruce.

272
00:24:52,893 --> 00:24:54,451
We don't need to see this.

273
00:24:55,173 --> 00:24:56,652
I do.

274
00:25:01,573 --> 00:25:03,882
The DA couldn't understand
why Judge Faden insisted...

275
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:05,417
...on making the hearing public.

276
00:25:05,452 --> 00:25:07,888
Falcone paid him off
to get Chill out in the open.

277
00:25:08,093 --> 00:25:09,252
Maybe I should thank them.

278
00:25:09,287 --> 00:25:11,921
- You don't mean that.
- What if I do, Rachel?

279
00:25:11,956 --> 00:25:13,889
My parents deserved justice.

280
00:25:13,924 --> 00:25:16,865
You're not talking about justice.
You're talking about revenge.

281
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,771
- Sometimes, they're the same.
- No, they're never the same.

282
00:25:19,806 --> 00:25:23,409
Justice is about harmony. Revenge is
about you making yourself feel better.

283
00:25:23,444 --> 00:25:26,724
- It's why we have an impartial system.
- Your system is broken.

284
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:36,252
You care about justice?
Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.

285
00:25:36,653 --> 00:25:38,017
This city is rotting.

286
00:25:38,052 --> 00:25:40,886
They talk about the depression
as if it's history. It's not.

287
00:25:40,921 --> 00:25:42,451
Things are worse than ever here.

288
00:25:42,486 --> 00:25:45,052
Falcone floods our streets
with crime and drugs...

289
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:48,086
...preying on the desperate,
creating new Joe Chills every day.

290
00:25:48,121 --> 00:25:50,687
Falcone may not have killed
your parents, Bruce...

291
00:25:51,293 --> 00:25:53,682
...but he's destroying everything
that they stood for.

292
00:25:58,053 --> 00:26:00,806
You wanna thank him for that?
Here you go.

293
00:26:02,613 --> 00:26:05,525
We all know where to find him.
As long as he keeps the bad people rich...

294
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,694
...and the good people scared,
no one'll touch him.

295
00:26:07,729 --> 00:26:11,966
Good people like your parents, who'll
stand against injustice, they're gone.

296
00:26:12,001 --> 00:26:15,682
What chance does Gotham have
when the good people do nothing?

297
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,809
- I'm not one of your good people, Rachel.
- What do you mean?

298
00:26:21,973 --> 00:26:24,885
All these years, I wanted to kill him.

299
00:26:25,653 --> 00:26:27,166
Now I can't.

300
00:26:42,413 --> 00:26:44,051
Your father would be ashamed of you.

301
00:27:25,733 --> 00:27:28,122
You're taller than you look
in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.

302
00:27:28,573 --> 00:27:30,370
No gun? I'm insulted.

303
00:27:33,413 --> 00:27:37,042
- You could've just sent a thank-you note.
- I didn't come here to thank you.

304
00:27:37,077 --> 00:27:39,852
I came to show you that
not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you.

305
00:27:39,887 --> 00:27:41,571
Only those who know me, kid.

306
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:44,282
Look around you.
You'll see two councilmen...

307
00:27:44,613 --> 00:27:47,332
...a union official,
couple off-duty cops...

308
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:49,256
...and a judge.

309
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:53,571
I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of
blowing your head off in front of them.

310
00:27:53,606 --> 00:27:56,327
Now, that's power you can't buy.

311
00:27:56,933 --> 00:27:58,332
That's the power of fear.

312
00:27:58,733 --> 00:27:59,892
I'm not afraid of you.

313
00:27:59,927 --> 00:28:01,924
Because you think you got
nothing to lose.

314
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:03,650
But you haven't thought it through.

315
00:28:03,685 --> 00:28:06,811
You haven't thought about
your lady friend in the DA's office.

316
00:28:06,846 --> 00:28:09,885
You haven't thought about
your old butler. Bang!

317
00:28:13,253 --> 00:28:15,590
People from your world...

318
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:17,893
...have so much to lose.

319
00:28:17,928 --> 00:28:22,245
Now, you think because your mommy
and your daddy got shot...

320
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,246
...you know about the ugly side of life,
but you don't.

321
00:28:25,281 --> 00:28:27,414
You've never tasted desperate.

322
00:28:27,449 --> 00:28:30,012
You're... You're Bruce Wayne,
the prince of Gotham.

323
00:28:30,047 --> 00:28:33,909
You'd have to go 1000 miles to meet
someone who didn't know your name.

324
00:28:33,944 --> 00:28:37,771
So don't come here with your anger,
trying to prove something to yourself.

325
00:28:37,806 --> 00:28:39,969
This is a world you'll never understand.

326
00:28:40,004 --> 00:28:42,009
And you always fear...

327
00:28:42,044 --> 00:28:44,568
...what you don't understand.

328
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:48,652
All right.

329
00:28:55,973 --> 00:28:58,692
Yeah, you got spirit, kid.
I'll give you that.

330
00:28:58,727 --> 00:29:00,729
More than your old man anyway.

331
00:29:00,764 --> 00:29:05,051
In the joint, Chill told me about
the night he killed your parents.

332
00:29:05,086 --> 00:29:07,329
He said your father begged for mercy.

333
00:29:08,653 --> 00:29:10,232
Begged.

334
00:29:10,267 --> 00:29:11,812
Like a dog.

335
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:25,851
Should've tipped better.

336
00:29:35,453 --> 00:29:37,205
- For what?
- Your jacket.

337
00:29:37,733 --> 00:29:39,291
Okay.

338
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:43,643
Hey, hey, hey. Let me have it.
It's a nice coat.

339
00:29:43,678 --> 00:29:45,849
Be careful who sees you with that.

340
00:29:46,413 --> 00:29:48,244
- They're gonna come looking for me.
- Who?

341
00:29:48,693 --> 00:29:50,331
Everyone.

342
00:29:52,533 --> 00:29:54,170
It's...

343
00:29:54,205 --> 00:29:56,284
It's a nice coat.

344
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:17,790
When you lived among
the criminals, did you start to pity them?

345
00:30:17,825 --> 00:30:21,728
The first time I stole
so that I wouldn't starve, yes.

346
00:30:21,933 --> 00:30:27,166
I lost many assumptions about
the simple nature of right and wrong.

347
00:30:28,413 --> 00:30:30,369
And when I traveled...

348
00:30:30,404 --> 00:30:33,167
...I learned the fear before a crime...

349
00:30:33,893 --> 00:30:36,361
...and the thrill of success.

350
00:30:38,006 --> 00:30:39,970
But I never became one of them.

351
00:30:42,693 --> 00:30:45,685
Fool. What do I care
what your name is? You're a criminal.

352
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,410
I'm not a criminal

353
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:49,683
Tell that to the guy who owned these.

354
00:30:51,693 --> 00:30:54,685
You've traveled the world
to understand the criminal mind...

355
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,081
...and conquer your fears.

356
00:30:58,093 --> 00:31:02,017
But a criminal is not complicated.

357
00:31:02,052 --> 00:31:05,410
And what you really fear
is inside yourself.

358
00:31:05,445 --> 00:31:07,423
You fear your own power.

359
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:09,401
You fear your anger...

360
00:31:09,853 --> 00:31:13,926
...the drive to do great
or terrible things.

361
00:31:13,961 --> 00:31:17,403
Now you must journey inwards.

362
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:23,004
You are ready.

363
00:31:23,973 --> 00:31:25,326
Breathe.

364
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:36,290
Breathe.

365
00:31:41,093 --> 00:31:42,845
Breathe in your fears.

366
00:31:45,373 --> 00:31:46,362
Face them.

367
00:31:47,813 --> 00:31:50,848
To conquer fear,
you must become fear.

368
00:31:50,883 --> 00:31:53,884
You must bask in the fear
of other men.

369
00:31:55,293 --> 00:31:58,569
And men fear most
what they cannot see.

370
00:32:15,093 --> 00:32:17,846
You have to become a terrible thought.

371
00:32:22,213 --> 00:32:23,362
A wraith.

372
00:32:28,853 --> 00:32:31,128
You have to become an idea!

373
00:32:37,733 --> 00:32:40,645
Feel terror cloud your senses.

374
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:45,405
Feel its power to distort.

375
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:48,449
To control.

376
00:32:51,413 --> 00:32:55,042
And know that this power
can be yours.

377
00:33:07,093 --> 00:33:09,653
Embrace your worst fear.

378
00:33:16,373 --> 00:33:18,568
Become one with the darkness.

379
00:33:37,573 --> 00:33:39,211
Focus.

380
00:33:39,493 --> 00:33:41,528
Concentrate.

381
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:43,769
Master your senses.

382
00:34:10,693 --> 00:34:13,048
You cannot leave any sign.

383
00:34:13,413 --> 00:34:14,562
I haven't.

384
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:24,444
Impressive.

385
00:34:33,173 --> 00:34:35,164
We have purged your fear.

386
00:34:36,293 --> 00:34:37,816
You are ready to lead these men.

387
00:34:37,851 --> 00:34:41,403
You are ready to become a member
of the League of Shadows.

388
00:34:43,933 --> 00:34:47,926
But first, you must demonstrate
your commitment to justice.

389
00:35:03,973 --> 00:35:05,292
No.

390
00:35:06,693 --> 00:35:07,921
I'm no executioner.

391
00:35:08,453 --> 00:35:11,968
Your compassion is
a weakness your enemies will not share.

392
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:14,528
That's why it's so important.

393
00:35:14,773 --> 00:35:16,410
It separates us from them.

394
00:35:16,445 --> 00:35:18,843
You want to fight criminals.
This man is a murderer.

395
00:35:18,878 --> 00:35:20,844
- This man should be tried.
By whom?

396
00:35:21,053 --> 00:35:22,531
Corrupt bureaucrats?

397
00:35:22,566 --> 00:35:25,027
Criminals mock society's laws.

398
00:35:25,062 --> 00:35:27,488
You know this better than most.

399
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:30,812
You cannot lead these men...

400
00:35:30,847 --> 00:35:34,847
...unless you are prepared to do
what is necessary to defeat evil.

401
00:35:35,413 --> 00:35:37,722
And where would I be leading
these men?

402
00:35:38,253 --> 00:35:39,446
Gotham.

403
00:35:39,481 --> 00:35:41,574
As Gotham's favored son...

404
00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:45,925
...you will be ideally placed
to strike at the heart of criminality.

405
00:35:46,293 --> 00:35:49,853
- How?
- Gotham's time has come.

406
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:53,215
Like Constantinople or Rome before it...

407
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:57,452
...the city has become a breeding ground
for suffering and injustice.

408
00:35:57,487 --> 00:36:01,048
It is beyond saving
and must be allowed to die.

409
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:06,202
This is the most important function
of the League of Shadows.

410
00:36:06,493 --> 00:36:09,451
It is one we've performed for centuries.

411
00:36:09,773 --> 00:36:11,410
Gotham...

412
00:36:11,445 --> 00:36:14,366
...must be destroyed.

413
00:36:17,573 --> 00:36:19,006
You can't believe in this.

414
00:36:19,213 --> 00:36:23,570
Ra's al Ghul rescued us from
the darkest corners of our own hearts.

415
00:36:23,605 --> 00:36:27,965
What he asks in return is the courage
to do what is necessary.

416
00:36:28,173 --> 00:36:31,370
I will go back to Gotham
and I will fight men like this...

417
00:36:31,405 --> 00:36:34,001
...but I will not become an executioner.

418
00:36:34,036 --> 00:36:35,617
Bruce, please.

419
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:38,532
For your own sake,
there is no turning back.

420
00:37:09,573 --> 00:37:12,007
- What are you doing?
- What's necessary, my friend.

421
00:39:22,853 --> 00:39:25,845
I will tell him you saved his life.

422
00:39:43,813 --> 00:39:46,210
Master Wayne,
you've been gone a long time.

423
00:39:46,245 --> 00:39:48,608
- Yes, I have.
- You look very fashionable.

424
00:39:50,053 --> 00:39:51,486
Apart from the mud.

425
00:39:51,733 --> 00:39:54,293
Are you coming back to Gotham
for long, sir?

426
00:39:54,328 --> 00:39:55,612
As long as it takes.

427
00:39:55,647 --> 00:39:57,211
I want to show the people...

428
00:39:57,246 --> 00:40:00,654
...their city doesn't belong
to the criminals and the corrupt.

429
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:03,925
In the depression, your father nearly
bankrupted Wayne Enterprises...

430
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,242
...combating poverty.

431
00:40:05,453 --> 00:40:09,765
He believed his example could inspire
the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.

432
00:40:10,053 --> 00:40:11,611
Did it?

433
00:40:12,693 --> 00:40:14,057
In a way.

434
00:40:14,092 --> 00:40:17,211
Their murder shocked the wealthy
and the powerful into action.

435
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:22,045
People need dramatic examples
to shake them out of apathy.

436
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,805
I can't do that as Bruce Wayne.

437
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,417
As a man...

438
00:40:25,452 --> 00:40:27,922
...I'm flesh and blood,
I can be ignored, destroyed.

439
00:40:27,957 --> 00:40:29,924
But as a symbol...

440
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:33,950
As a symbol, I can be incorruptible.

441
00:40:33,985 --> 00:40:36,567
- I can be everlasting.
- What symbol?

442
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:39,272
Something elemental...

443
00:40:39,307 --> 00:40:41,376
...something terrifying.

444
00:40:41,411 --> 00:40:43,574
I assume that as you take on
the underworld...

445
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:48,688
...this symbol is a persona to protect
those you care about from reprisals?

446
00:40:48,723 --> 00:40:50,137
You're thinking about Rachel?

447
00:40:50,172 --> 00:40:52,608
Actually, sir, I was thinking of myself.

448
00:40:54,533 --> 00:40:56,205
Have you told anyone I'm coming back?

449
00:40:56,413 --> 00:41:00,452
I couldn't figure the legal ramifications
of bringing you back from the dead.

450
00:41:00,487 --> 00:41:02,410
- Dead?
- You've been gone seven years.

451
00:41:02,445 --> 00:41:03,766
You had me declared dead?

452
00:41:03,801 --> 00:41:06,726
Actually, it was Mr. Earle.
He's taking the company public.

453
00:41:06,761 --> 00:41:09,088
He wanted to liquidate
your majority shareholding.

454
00:41:09,123 --> 00:41:11,448
Those shares are worth
quite a bit of money.

455
00:41:11,483 --> 00:41:14,247
Well, it's a good thing
I left everything to you, then.

456
00:41:14,773 --> 00:41:16,296
Quite so, sir.

457
00:41:16,331 --> 00:41:20,088
And you can borrow the Rolls, if you like.
Just bring it back with a full tank.

458
00:41:29,733 --> 00:41:34,249
In my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much
a danger to himself as to others...

459
00:41:34,613 --> 00:41:39,004
...and prison is probably not the best
environment for his rehabilitation.

460
00:41:41,213 --> 00:41:43,646
- Dr. Crane.
- Miss Dawes.

461
00:41:43,681 --> 00:41:47,004
You think a man who butchers people
for the mob doesn't belong in jail?

462
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:49,698
I would hardly have testified to that
otherwise, would I?

463
00:41:49,733 --> 00:41:52,851
This is the third of Falcone's thugs
you've had declared insane...

464
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:54,366
...and moved into your asylum.

465
00:41:54,573 --> 00:41:59,010
The work offered by organized crime
must have an attraction to the insane.

466
00:42:00,493 --> 00:42:02,404
Or the corrupt.

467
00:42:04,573 --> 00:42:06,086
Mr. Finch.

468
00:42:06,413 --> 00:42:08,096
You should check
with Miss Dawes here...

469
00:42:08,131 --> 00:42:12,491
...just what implications your office
has authorized her to make. If any.

470
00:42:16,293 --> 00:42:18,523
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing, Carl?

471
00:42:18,558 --> 00:42:20,012
Looking out for you.

472
00:42:22,413 --> 00:42:25,211
Falcone has half the city
bought and paid for.

473
00:42:25,246 --> 00:42:27,294
- Drop it.
- How can you say that?

474
00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:31,042
Because as much as I care about
getting Falcone, I care more about you.

475
00:42:31,077 --> 00:42:32,441
That's sweet.

476
00:42:37,653 --> 00:42:39,928
We've been through all that.

477
00:43:04,933 --> 00:43:06,332
Blessed bat again, sir.

478
00:43:06,773 --> 00:43:09,082
They nest somewhere in the grounds.

479
00:45:02,133 --> 00:45:04,692
No more favors.
Someone is sniffing around.

480
00:45:04,727 --> 00:45:07,726
Hey, I scratch your back,
you scratch mine, doc.

481
00:45:07,761 --> 00:45:09,212
I'm bringing in the shipments.

482
00:45:09,893 --> 00:45:11,007
We are paying you for that.

483
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,602
Maybe money isn't as interesting
to me as favors.

484
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:20,609
I am more than aware that you are
not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.

485
00:45:20,644 --> 00:45:23,731
But you know who I'm working for,
and when he gets here...

486
00:45:23,766 --> 00:45:25,724
He... He's coming to Gotham?

487
00:45:25,759 --> 00:45:27,257
Yes, he is.

488
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:29,773
And when he gets here,
he's not going to wanna hear...

489
00:45:29,808 --> 00:45:34,842
...that you've endangered our operation
just to get your thugs out of jail time.

490
00:45:35,813 --> 00:45:39,010
- Who's bothering you?
- There's a girl at the DA's office.

491
00:45:39,493 --> 00:45:41,211
- We'll buy her off.
- Not this one.

492
00:45:42,293 --> 00:45:44,089
Idealist, huh?

493
00:45:44,124 --> 00:45:45,931
Well, there's an answer to that too.

494
00:45:46,293 --> 00:45:49,126
- I don't want to know.
- Yes, you do.

495
00:45:53,133 --> 00:45:56,408
No, we are showing
very healthy growth in these sectors.

496
00:45:56,443 --> 00:45:59,650
I don't think Thomas Wayne would have
viewed heavy-arms manufacture...

497
00:45:59,685 --> 00:46:01,883
...as a suitable cornerstone
for our business.

498
00:46:03,213 --> 00:46:06,842
Well, that's 20 years ago, Fredericks.

499
00:46:07,173 --> 00:46:10,175
I think after 20 years
we can allow ourselves...

500
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:13,092
...to stop thinking about what
Thomas Wayne would have done.

501
00:46:13,127 --> 00:46:15,015
Good morning, Mr. Earle's office.

502
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:18,364
Yes, he's confirmed for
the dinner tomorrow evening.

503
00:46:18,399 --> 00:46:21,730
Good morning.
I'm here to see Mr. Earle.

504
00:46:21,765 --> 00:46:23,326
Name?

505
00:46:23,773 --> 00:46:25,365
Bruce Wayne.

506
00:46:27,173 --> 00:46:30,494
Thomas would probably not
have taken the company public.

507
00:46:30,529 --> 00:46:34,606
But that is what we,
as responsible managers, are going to do.

508
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:36,772
Jessica?

509
00:46:37,813 --> 00:46:40,212
Jessica? Where are you?

510
00:46:40,247 --> 00:46:44,486
Eye on the ball, and...
- Why is no one answering the phone?

511
00:46:45,133 --> 00:46:48,170
It's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle.
I'm sure they'll call back.

512
00:46:48,493 --> 00:46:50,882
Bruce? You're supposed to be dead.

513
00:46:50,917 --> 00:46:52,895
I'm sorry to disappoint.

514
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:55,687
- I need you to take a look at this.
- Have you seen him yet?

515
00:46:55,973 --> 00:46:57,452
- Who?
- Wayne.

516
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,764
It's been all over the news.
He's back.

517
00:47:03,533 --> 00:47:06,331
I'm sure you realize
I can't stop the big machine.

518
00:47:06,366 --> 00:47:07,642
Too many wheels turning.

519
00:47:07,853 --> 00:47:09,764
- We're going public.
- I understand.

520
00:47:10,213 --> 00:47:12,932
And I'll be handsomely rewarded
for my shares.

521
00:47:12,967 --> 00:47:15,527
I'm not looking to interfere.

522
00:47:15,973 --> 00:47:17,974
- I am looking for a job.
- Oh?

523
00:47:18,009 --> 00:47:21,085
I just want to get to know the company
that my family built.

524
00:47:21,413 --> 00:47:23,085
Any ideas where you would start?

525
00:47:23,573 --> 00:47:25,848
Applied Sciences caught my eye.

526
00:47:26,213 --> 00:47:27,816
Fox's department.

527
00:47:27,851 --> 00:47:29,924
I'll let him know you're coming.

528
00:47:30,813 --> 00:47:33,452
You look like him. Your dad.

529
00:47:34,213 --> 00:47:36,773
You're the only one left
of the Wayne family.

530
00:47:36,808 --> 00:47:40,721
This is where you belong.
Welcome home.

531
00:47:41,053 --> 00:47:45,365
Environmental procedures,
defense projects, consumer products.

532
00:47:45,853 --> 00:47:48,513
All prototypes. None in production.

533
00:47:48,548 --> 00:47:51,173
- On any level whatsoever.
- None?

534
00:47:52,133 --> 00:47:54,071
What did they tell you this place was?

535
00:47:54,106 --> 00:47:56,009
They didn't tell me anything.

536
00:47:58,373 --> 00:48:01,683
Earle told me exactly what it was
when he sent me down here.

537
00:48:02,133 --> 00:48:03,497
Dead end.

538
00:48:03,532 --> 00:48:06,890
Place to keep me from causing
the board any more trouble.

539
00:48:07,813 --> 00:48:09,211
Come on.

540
00:48:09,246 --> 00:48:11,768
- You were on the board?
- When your father ran things.

541
00:48:11,803 --> 00:48:13,730
- You knew my father?
- Oh, yeah.

542
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:15,485
Helped him build his train.

543
00:48:16,053 --> 00:48:17,611
Here we are.

544
00:48:21,133 --> 00:48:22,691
Kevlar utility harness.

545
00:48:23,053 --> 00:48:25,188
Gas-powered, magnetic grapple gun.

546
00:48:25,223 --> 00:48:27,323
The 350-pound test monofilament.

547
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:32,603
Wonderful project, your dad's train.

548
00:48:33,093 --> 00:48:37,530
Routed it right into Wayne Tower,
along with the water and power utilities.

549
00:48:37,565 --> 00:48:40,765
Kind of made Wayne Tower
the unofficial center of Gotham City.

550
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,493
Of course, Earle let it go to rot.
Here we are.

551
00:48:45,293 --> 00:48:47,329
Nomex survival suit
for advanced infantry.

552
00:48:47,533 --> 00:48:50,172
Kevlar biweave, reinforced joints.

553
00:48:50,493 --> 00:48:52,771
- Tear-resistant?
- This sucker will stop a knife.

554
00:48:52,806 --> 00:48:55,014
- Bulletproof?
- Anything but a straight shot.

555
00:48:55,049 --> 00:48:57,966
- Why didn't they put it into production?
- Bean counters didn't think...

556
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:00,408
...a soldier's life was worth 300 grand.

557
00:49:01,453 --> 00:49:04,763
So, what's your interest in it,
Mr. Wayne?

558
00:49:05,413 --> 00:49:06,846
I want to borrow it.

559
00:49:06,881 --> 00:49:08,731
For spelunking.

560
00:49:09,573 --> 00:49:10,766
Spelunking?

561
00:49:10,801 --> 00:49:12,611
Yeah, you know, cave diving?

562
00:49:13,853 --> 00:49:16,413
You expecting to run into
much gunfire in these caves?

563
00:49:18,653 --> 00:49:21,770
Look, I'd rather Mr. Earle
didn't know about me borrowing...

564
00:49:21,805 --> 00:49:23,127
Mr. Wayne...

565
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:25,164
...the way I see it...

566
00:49:25,613 --> 00:49:27,968
...all this stuff is yours anyway.

567
00:49:30,813 --> 00:49:33,202
Okay. Give it a try.

568
00:49:37,173 --> 00:49:38,367
Charming.

569
00:49:41,093 --> 00:49:42,811
At least you'll have company.

570
00:49:44,613 --> 00:49:48,447
This must be the lowest foundation
of the southeast wing.

571
00:50:00,413 --> 00:50:04,406
Your great-great-grandfather was
involved in the Underground Railroad...

572
00:50:04,441 --> 00:50:07,451
...secretly transporting freed slaves
to the North...

573
00:50:07,486 --> 00:50:11,162
...and I suspect these caverns
came in handy.

574
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:25,403
Alfred! Come up here!

575
00:50:25,613 --> 00:50:28,446
I can see everything all right
from down here, sir, thank you.

576
00:50:47,653 --> 00:50:50,213
We order the main part
of this cowl from Singapore.

577
00:50:50,248 --> 00:50:51,771
Via a dummy corporation.

578
00:50:51,806 --> 00:50:53,690
Indeed. And then, quite separately...

579
00:50:53,725 --> 00:50:58,648
...we place an order
to a Chinese company for these.

580
00:50:59,173 --> 00:51:01,971
- Put it together ourselves.
- Precisely.

581
00:51:02,006 --> 00:51:06,052
They'll have to be large orders,
to avoid suspicion.

582
00:51:06,087 --> 00:51:08,647
- How large?
- Say 10,000.

583
00:51:11,053 --> 00:51:13,851
- Well, at least we'll have spares.
- Yes.

584
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,209
Don't suppose you want a taste.

585
00:51:32,244 --> 00:51:35,450
I just keep offering,
thinking maybe someday you'll get wise.

586
00:51:35,485 --> 00:51:37,648
There's nothing wise
in what you do, Flass.

587
00:51:37,683 --> 00:51:41,084
Well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste,
makes us guys nervous.

588
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:43,005
I'm no rat.

589
00:51:45,653 --> 00:51:49,202
In a town this bent,
who's there to rat to anyway?

590
00:52:17,693 --> 00:52:19,729
Don't turn around.

591
00:52:20,293 --> 00:52:23,251
You're a good cop.
One of the few.

592
00:52:23,893 --> 00:52:24,927
What do you want?

593
00:52:24,962 --> 00:52:28,170
Carmine Falcone brings
in shipments of drugs every week.

594
00:52:28,205 --> 00:52:30,051
Nobody takes him down. Why?

595
00:52:31,413 --> 00:52:33,449
He's paid up with the right people.

596
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:36,406
What will it take to bring him down?

597
00:52:37,093 --> 00:52:39,402
Leverage on Judge Faden...

598
00:52:40,093 --> 00:52:42,368
...and a DA brave enough
to prosecute.

599
00:52:42,773 --> 00:52:44,331
Rachel Dawes.

600
00:52:44,893 --> 00:52:45,962
Who are you?

601
00:52:46,373 --> 00:52:47,931
Watch for my sign.

602
00:52:50,493 --> 00:52:52,449
You're just one man?

603
00:52:52,853 --> 00:52:54,206
Now we're two.

604
00:52:56,253 --> 00:52:57,003
We?

605
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:14,445
Freeze!

606
00:53:30,933 --> 00:53:32,764
What the hell was that?

607
00:53:35,573 --> 00:53:36,722
Just some nut.

608
00:53:40,013 --> 00:53:42,686
Well, what is it today?
More spelunking?

609
00:53:42,721 --> 00:53:45,242
No. Today it's BASE-jumping.

610
00:53:45,813 --> 00:53:47,371
BASE-jumping.

611
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,367
- That like parachuting?
- Kind of.

612
00:53:51,533 --> 00:53:54,233
Do you have any lightweight fabrics?

613
00:53:54,268 --> 00:53:56,933
You know, I think I have just the thing.

614
00:53:58,213 --> 00:54:00,568
It's called memory cloth.
Notice anything?

615
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:05,570
Regularly flexible...

616
00:54:05,973 --> 00:54:08,009
...but put a current through it...

617
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:12,962
...molecules realign, it becomes rigid.
- What kind of shapes can you make?

618
00:54:12,997 --> 00:54:16,125
Can be tailored to fit any structure
based on a rigid skeleton.

619
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,407
Too expensive for the Army?

620
00:54:17,442 --> 00:54:22,164
I don't think they tried to market it
to the billionaire, BASE-jumping crowd.

621
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:24,051
- Look, Mr. Fox.
- Yes, sir?

622
00:54:24,693 --> 00:54:25,977
If you're uncomfortable...

623
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:29,245
Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me
exactly what you're doing...

624
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,290
...when I'm asked, I don't have to lie.

625
00:54:32,933 --> 00:54:35,447
But don't think of me as an idiot.

626
00:54:36,893 --> 00:54:38,770
Fair enough.

627
00:54:40,613 --> 00:54:42,365
What's that?

628
00:54:44,373 --> 00:54:46,204
The Tumbler?

629
00:54:46,693 --> 00:54:48,570
Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.

630
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:56,164
She was built as a bridging vehicle.

631
00:54:58,053 --> 00:55:02,331
During combat, two of these
would jump over a river, towing cables.

632
00:55:04,773 --> 00:55:08,243
Over here on the throttle,
flip that open and throttle up.

633
00:55:08,453 --> 00:55:10,887
This will boost you into a rampless jump...
Not now!

634
00:55:13,613 --> 00:55:15,649
Not... Not now, sir.

635
00:55:18,373 --> 00:55:20,170
Afterburner disengaged.

636
00:55:20,533 --> 00:55:23,445
We never could get
the damn bridge to work...

637
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,251
...but this baby works just fine.

638
00:55:34,413 --> 00:55:35,607
So, what do you think?

639
00:55:36,813 --> 00:55:38,724
Does it come in black?

640
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:41,608
I need you at the docks Thursday.

641
00:55:41,853 --> 00:55:43,650
- Problems?
- I don't want any trouble...

642
00:55:43,685 --> 00:55:45,849
...with the last shipment.
- Sure.

643
00:55:47,373 --> 00:55:50,888
Word on the street is you got a beef
with somebody in the DA's office.

644
00:55:50,923 --> 00:55:53,327
- Is that right?
- And that there's a fat prize...

645
00:55:53,362 --> 00:55:56,127
...waiting for anybody willing
to do anything about it.

646
00:55:56,162 --> 00:55:58,170
So, what's your point, Mr. Flass?

647
00:55:58,613 --> 00:55:59,807
Have you seen the girl?

648
00:56:00,293 --> 00:56:02,818
It's a cute little assistant D A.

649
00:56:02,853 --> 00:56:06,528
Don't you think that's a little too much
heat to bring down, maybe?

650
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:09,855
- Even for this town.
- Never underestimate Gotham City.

651
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:12,772
People get mugged coming home
from work every day of the week.

652
00:56:12,807 --> 00:56:15,447
Sometimes...
Sometimes things just go bad.

653
00:56:19,173 --> 00:56:20,891
It's a problem with the graphite, sir.

654
00:56:21,093 --> 00:56:23,687
The next 10,000
will be up to specifications.

655
00:56:23,722 --> 00:56:26,246
- At least they gave us a discount.
- Quite.

656
00:56:26,281 --> 00:56:31,846
In the meantime, sir, may I suggest
you try to avoid landing on your head?

657
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:09,289
Why bats, Master Wayne?

658
00:57:09,533 --> 00:57:10,727
Bats frighten me.

659
00:57:11,973 --> 00:57:14,168
It's time my enemies shared my dread.

660
00:57:39,773 --> 00:57:41,604
What is this?

661
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,527
Continue.

662
00:57:51,813 --> 00:57:53,405
Looks fine out there.

663
00:57:53,813 --> 00:57:55,609
The bears go straight to the dealers.

664
00:57:55,644 --> 00:57:58,338
Yeah, and the rabbits go
to the man in the Narrows.

665
00:57:58,373 --> 00:58:01,491
- What's the difference?
- Ignorance is bliss, my friend.

666
00:58:01,526 --> 00:58:04,610
Don't burden yourself
with these secrets of scary people.

667
00:58:19,813 --> 00:58:22,691
Hey. Steiss.

668
00:58:43,133 --> 00:58:44,532
Steiss?

669
00:58:55,973 --> 00:58:57,531
What?

670
00:58:58,213 --> 00:58:59,646
What the...?

671
00:59:08,293 --> 00:59:10,045
I better check it.

672
00:59:22,093 --> 00:59:24,004
There's a problem out here.
You better bail.

673
00:59:52,133 --> 00:59:53,407
Where are you?!

674
00:59:53,442 --> 00:59:54,562
Here.

675
01:00:15,053 --> 01:00:18,204
Take a ride. Oh, shit.

676
01:00:35,653 --> 01:00:37,325
What the hell are you?

677
01:00:40,613 --> 01:00:41,728
I'm Batman.

678
01:00:49,733 --> 01:00:51,610
Nice coat.

679
01:00:53,253 --> 01:00:54,732
Thanks.

680
01:01:34,093 --> 01:01:35,287
Hold it.

681
01:01:37,333 --> 01:01:39,688
That's right, you better run.

682
01:01:48,293 --> 01:01:50,045
Falcone sent them to kill you.

683
01:01:51,133 --> 01:01:53,601
- Why?
- You rattled his cage.

684
01:01:57,253 --> 01:01:58,697
- What's this?
- Leverage.

685
01:01:58,732 --> 01:02:00,451
- For what?
- To get things moving.

686
01:02:00,733 --> 01:02:02,644
Who are you?

687
01:02:03,013 --> 01:02:04,172
Someone like you.

688
01:02:04,207 --> 01:02:06,329
Someone who'll rattle the cages.

689
01:02:11,213 --> 01:02:14,569
Ma'am? Everything okay?

690
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:21,070
Falcone's men?
- Does it matter?

691
01:02:21,105 --> 01:02:23,448
We'll never tie him to it anyway.

692
01:02:23,653 --> 01:02:25,689
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

693
01:02:38,213 --> 01:02:39,965
What the hell is that?

694
01:02:49,173 --> 01:02:50,367
Cut him down.

695
01:03:12,053 --> 01:03:13,212
Unacceptable.

696
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:16,132
Now, I don't care if it's rival gangs,
Guardian Angels...

697
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:18,170
...or the goddamn Salvation Army...

698
01:03:18,413 --> 01:03:20,643
...get them off the street
and off the front page.

699
01:03:20,678 --> 01:03:23,281
They say it was just one guy.
Or a creature.

700
01:03:23,316 --> 01:03:26,047
It was some asshole in a costume.

701
01:03:26,533 --> 01:03:28,749
- Yeah?
- This guy did deliver us...

702
01:03:28,784 --> 01:03:30,931
...one of the city's biggest crime lords.

703
01:03:30,966 --> 01:03:34,489
No one takes the law
into their own hands in my city.

704
01:03:34,524 --> 01:03:35,767
Understand?

705
01:03:35,802 --> 01:03:38,691
No way to bury it now.
There's still Judge Faden.

706
01:03:38,726 --> 01:03:41,728
- I've got Faden covered.
- What about this bat they babble about?

707
01:03:41,763 --> 01:03:44,731
Even if these guys will swear
to being thrashed by a giant bat...

708
01:03:44,766 --> 01:03:46,928
...we've got Falcone at the scene.

709
01:03:46,963 --> 01:03:50,205
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests.
This bat character gave us everything.

710
01:03:50,613 --> 01:03:52,092
Okay. Let's do it.

711
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:57,374
- Bats are nocturnal.
Bats may be.

712
01:03:57,409 --> 01:04:00,849
But even for billionaire playboys,
3:00 is pushing it.

713
01:04:01,853 --> 01:04:04,606
The price for leading a double life,
I fear.

714
01:04:05,893 --> 01:04:08,202
Your theatrics made an impression.

715
01:04:09,533 --> 01:04:12,410
Theatricality and deception...

716
01:04:12,445 --> 01:04:15,485
...are powerful weapons, Alfred.
This is a good start.

717
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,526
If those are to be the first
of many injuries to come...

718
01:04:18,561 --> 01:04:21,412
...it would be wise
to find a suitable excuse.

719
01:04:21,733 --> 01:04:22,972
Polo, for instance.

720
01:04:23,007 --> 01:04:24,765
I'm not learning polo, Alfred.

721
01:04:25,013 --> 01:04:28,528
Strange injuries,
a nonexistent social life.

722
01:04:28,563 --> 01:04:30,057
These things beg the question...

723
01:04:30,092 --> 01:04:34,326
...as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne
do with his time and his money.

724
01:04:34,361 --> 01:04:36,006
What does someone like me do?

725
01:04:36,933 --> 01:04:40,972
Drive sports cars, date movie stars.

726
01:04:41,613 --> 01:04:43,091
Buy things that are not for sale.

727
01:04:43,126 --> 01:04:46,683
Who knows, Master Wayne,
you start pretending to have fun...

728
01:04:47,293 --> 01:04:49,204
...you might even have a little
by accident.

729
01:04:51,813 --> 01:04:53,177
Sir.

730
01:04:53,212 --> 01:04:55,603
- We have a situation.
- All right.

731
01:04:55,973 --> 01:04:59,648
The Coast Guard picked up
one of our cargo ships last night...

732
01:05:00,173 --> 01:05:04,769
...heavily damaged, all crew missing,
probably dead.

733
01:05:06,733 --> 01:05:09,008
The ship was carrying
a prototype weapon.

734
01:05:09,213 --> 01:05:10,896
It's a microwave emitter.

735
01:05:10,931 --> 01:05:13,926
It's designed for desert warfare, but it...

736
01:05:15,533 --> 01:05:17,046
It looks like somebody...

737
01:05:21,253 --> 01:05:22,686
...turned it on.

738
01:05:26,693 --> 01:05:30,971
It uses focused microwaves to
vaporize the enemy's water supply.

739
01:05:38,573 --> 01:05:41,406
The damage to the ship
was catastrophic.

740
01:05:41,441 --> 01:05:44,451
The weapon itself is...

741
01:05:45,693 --> 01:05:47,126
Missing?

742
01:05:47,933 --> 01:05:49,127
Yeah.

743
01:05:50,373 --> 01:05:52,250
Mr. Wayne.

744
01:05:55,813 --> 01:05:57,177
Nice car.

745
01:05:57,212 --> 01:05:58,692
You should see my other one.

746
01:06:08,093 --> 01:06:10,128
He's done something
the police never have.

747
01:06:10,163 --> 01:06:12,662
You can't take the law
into your own hands.

748
01:06:12,697 --> 01:06:15,161
Well, at least he's getting
something done.

749
01:06:15,196 --> 01:06:17,528
Bruce, help me out here.
- Huh?

750
01:06:17,563 --> 01:06:21,885
Well, a guy who dresses up
like a bat clearly has issues.

751
01:06:22,893 --> 01:06:25,008
But he's put Falcone behind bars.

752
01:06:25,043 --> 01:06:27,488
Now the cops want him.
What does that tell you?

753
01:06:27,523 --> 01:06:28,767
They're jealous.

754
01:06:28,802 --> 01:06:31,452
Sir, the pool is for decoration...

755
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:34,884
...and your friends
do not have swimwear.

756
01:06:36,613 --> 01:06:38,524
Well, they're European.

757
01:06:40,293 --> 01:06:42,568
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

758
01:06:43,453 --> 01:06:46,763
- It is not a question of money.
- Well, you see...

759
01:06:47,333 --> 01:06:49,051
...I'm buying this hotel...

760
01:06:50,773 --> 01:06:55,005
...and setting some new rules
about the pool area.

761
01:06:56,133 --> 01:06:58,371
I think the Batman deserves a medal.

762
01:06:58,406 --> 01:07:00,609
And a straitjacket to pin it on.

763
01:07:06,853 --> 01:07:08,366
Thank you.

764
01:07:10,053 --> 01:07:11,327
Bruce?

765
01:07:14,773 --> 01:07:16,456
Rachel?

766
01:07:16,491 --> 01:07:18,006
I'd heard you were back.

767
01:07:19,973 --> 01:07:21,406
What are you doing?

768
01:07:22,133 --> 01:07:26,365
Just swimming here.
Wow, it is good to see you.

769
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,012
You were gone a long time.

770
01:07:28,573 --> 01:07:31,371
- I know. How are things?
- The same.

771
01:07:33,213 --> 01:07:34,770
Job's getting worse.

772
01:07:34,805 --> 01:07:37,567
Can't change the world on your own.

773
01:07:37,602 --> 01:07:39,724
What choice do I have...

774
01:07:40,373 --> 01:07:42,045
...when you're too busy swimming?

775
01:07:43,333 --> 01:07:45,289
Rachel, all of...

776
01:07:45,573 --> 01:07:47,165
All this...

777
01:07:48,533 --> 01:07:52,412
It's... It's not me. It's...

778
01:07:52,813 --> 01:07:55,327
Inside, I am...

779
01:07:56,493 --> 01:07:58,370
I am more.

780
01:07:59,013 --> 01:08:00,457
Come on, Bruce. Come on.

781
01:08:00,492 --> 01:08:04,282
Bruce, we have
some more hotels for you to buy.

782
01:08:05,293 --> 01:08:06,692
Bruce...

783
01:08:07,813 --> 01:08:11,169
...deep down you may still be
that same great kid you used to be.

784
01:08:13,493 --> 01:08:15,961
But it's not who you are underneath...

785
01:08:16,413 --> 01:08:18,085
...it's what you do that defines you.

786
01:08:30,133 --> 01:08:32,349
Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.

787
01:08:32,384 --> 01:08:34,531
Not at all. He cut his wrists?

788
01:08:34,566 --> 01:08:38,248
Probably looking for the insanity plea.
But if anything should happen...

789
01:08:38,283 --> 01:08:41,246
Of course, better safe than sorry.

790
01:08:44,533 --> 01:08:47,969
Yeah, Dr. Crane, I can't take it anymore.
It's all too much.

791
01:08:48,004 --> 01:08:50,488
The walls are closing in.
Blah, blah, blah.

792
01:08:51,013 --> 01:08:53,402
A couple of days of this food,
it'll be true.

793
01:08:54,373 --> 01:08:55,930
- What do you want?
- I wanna know...

794
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,522
...how you're gonna convince me
to keep my mouth shut.

795
01:08:58,557 --> 01:09:00,728
About what?
You don't know anything.

796
01:09:00,763 --> 01:09:04,926
I know you don't want the cops to take
a closer look at the drugs they seized.

797
01:09:04,961 --> 01:09:09,051
And I know about your experiments
with the inmates of your nut house.

798
01:09:09,086 --> 01:09:12,768
See, I don't go into business with a guy
without finding out his dirty secrets.

799
01:09:13,333 --> 01:09:16,096
And those goons you used.

800
01:09:16,131 --> 01:09:18,010
I own the muscle in this town.

801
01:09:18,045 --> 01:09:21,444
Now, I've been bringing
your stuff in for months...

802
01:09:21,973 --> 01:09:26,012
...so whatever he's planning,
it's big, and I want in.

803
01:09:27,253 --> 01:09:30,245
Well, I already know what he'll say.

804
01:09:30,653 --> 01:09:31,972
That we should kill you.

805
01:09:33,773 --> 01:09:36,924
Even he can't get me in here.
Not in my town.

806
01:09:42,653 --> 01:09:44,132
Would you like to see my mask?

807
01:09:45,613 --> 01:09:47,012
I use it in my experiments.

808
01:09:49,413 --> 01:09:53,691
Now, I'm probably not very frightening
to a guy like you.

809
01:09:54,053 --> 01:09:56,772
But these crazies, they can't stand it.

810
01:09:57,533 --> 01:09:59,524
So when did the nut
take over the nut house?

811
01:10:01,362 --> 01:10:03,410
They scream and they cry...

812
01:10:03,973 --> 01:10:05,531
...much as you're doing now.

813
01:10:07,773 --> 01:10:10,810
Well, he's not faking. Not that one.

814
01:10:10,845 --> 01:10:13,867
I'll talk to the judge
and see if I can get him moved...

815
01:10:13,902 --> 01:10:16,889
...to the secure wing at Arkham.
I can't treat him here.

816
01:10:38,013 --> 01:10:39,446
Storm's coming.

817
01:10:43,853 --> 01:10:47,068
The scum is getting jumpy
because you stood up to Falcone.

818
01:10:47,103 --> 01:10:50,283
It's a start. Your partner
was at the docks with Falcone.

819
01:10:50,318 --> 01:10:53,047
Well, he moonlights
as a low-level enforcer.

820
01:10:53,413 --> 01:10:57,042
They were splitting the shipment in two.
Only half went to the dealers.

821
01:10:57,077 --> 01:10:59,044
Why? What about the other half?

822
01:10:59,493 --> 01:11:01,802
- Flass knows.
- He won't talk.

823
01:11:02,413 --> 01:11:03,891
He'll talk to me.

824
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:07,005
Commissioner Loeb set up
a massive task force to catch you.

825
01:11:07,453 --> 01:11:09,887
- He thinks you're dangerous.
- What do you think?

826
01:11:11,573 --> 01:11:13,882
I think you're trying to help.

827
01:11:18,693 --> 01:11:20,923
But I've been wrong before.

828
01:11:26,493 --> 01:11:28,131
Come on, I ain't got all night.

829
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:33,085
Flass, I have kids to feed.

830
01:11:33,533 --> 01:11:35,603
What, they don't like falafel?

831
01:11:50,373 --> 01:11:52,011
Where were the other drugs going?

832
01:11:53,253 --> 01:11:55,288
I never knew. I don't know.

833
01:11:55,323 --> 01:11:57,609
- I swear to God.
- Swear to me!

834
01:12:03,013 --> 01:12:05,891
I don't... I don't know.
I never knew. Never.

835
01:12:06,173 --> 01:12:09,483
They went to some guy for a couple days
before they went to the dealers.

836
01:12:09,518 --> 01:12:10,881
Why?

837
01:12:11,533 --> 01:12:14,969
There was something...
Something else in the drugs...

838
01:12:15,004 --> 01:12:16,611
...something hidden.
- What?

839
01:12:16,646 --> 01:12:19,985
I never went to the drop-off point.
It was in the Narrows.

840
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:23,324
- Cops only go there in force.
- Do I look like a cop?

841
01:12:23,359 --> 01:12:25,211
No...!

842
01:12:38,253 --> 01:12:40,209
This is the one I'm talking about.

843
01:12:40,493 --> 01:12:42,653
- What's your problem with it?
- It shouldn't exist.

844
01:12:42,688 --> 01:12:45,845
This ship left Singapore with
246 containers, but arrived with 247.

845
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:49,142
I'm guessing there's something
I'm not supposed to find in there.

846
01:12:49,177 --> 01:12:52,404
Listen, counselor, we don't wanna
know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.

847
01:12:52,439 --> 01:12:55,770
Things are working a little
differently now. Open it up.

848
01:13:04,653 --> 01:13:05,881
What the hell is this?

849
01:13:47,013 --> 01:13:50,050
It's you, isn't it?
Everybody's been talking about you.

850
01:13:50,613 --> 01:13:52,285
Get in here!

851
01:13:52,893 --> 01:13:54,929
The other kids won't believe me.

852
01:14:17,093 --> 01:14:19,129
Get rid of all traces.

853
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:22,211
Better torch the whole place.
All right.

854
01:14:56,773 --> 01:14:58,491
Having trouble?

855
01:14:59,173 --> 01:15:01,403
Take a seat. Have a drink.

856
01:15:02,093 --> 01:15:05,210
You look like a man
who takes himself too seriously.

857
01:15:08,773 --> 01:15:11,651
Do you want my opinion?
You need to lighten up.

858
01:16:01,493 --> 01:16:05,042
Alfred, help me.

859
01:16:14,533 --> 01:16:17,764
Blood. Take. Take poison. Blood poison.

860
01:16:17,799 --> 01:16:20,811
Poisonous. Poisonous.

861
01:16:24,933 --> 01:16:26,571
Bruce...

862
01:16:27,813 --> 01:16:28,928
...why do we fall?

863
01:16:40,503 --> 01:16:43,700
- How long was I out?
- Two days.

864
01:16:44,063 --> 01:16:45,860
It's your birthday.

865
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:48,331
Many happy returns.

866
01:16:53,303 --> 01:16:57,418
I've felt these effects before,
but this was so much more potent.

867
01:16:57,453 --> 01:17:01,534
It was some kind of hallucinogen,
weaponized, in aerosol form.

868
01:17:01,569 --> 01:17:04,501
You have been hanging out
in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.

869
01:17:04,536 --> 01:17:07,661
I called Mr. Fox when your condition
worsened after the first day.

870
01:17:07,696 --> 01:17:09,107
I analyzed your blood...

871
01:17:09,142 --> 01:17:12,659
...isolating the receptor compounds
and the protein-based catalyst.

872
01:17:12,694 --> 01:17:14,541
Am I meant to understand any of that?

873
01:17:14,903 --> 01:17:17,940
Not at all. I just wanted you to know
how hard it was.

874
01:17:18,503 --> 01:17:22,052
- Bottom line, I synthesized an antidote.
- Could you make more?

875
01:17:22,087 --> 01:17:24,656
You planning on gassing yourself
again, Mr. Wayne?

876
01:17:24,691 --> 01:17:27,935
Well, you know how it is.
You're out at night, looking for kicks...

877
01:17:27,970 --> 01:17:30,707
...someone's passing around
the weaponized hallucinogens...

878
01:17:30,742 --> 01:17:34,213
I'll bring what I have.
The antidote should inoculate you for now.

879
01:17:34,248 --> 01:17:36,658
Alfred, always a pleasure.

880
01:17:36,693 --> 01:17:38,415
Lucius.

881
01:17:42,743 --> 01:17:45,303
- You sure you don't want to come in?
- I have to get back.

882
01:17:45,338 --> 01:17:47,101
- I wanted to leave this.
- Thank you.

883
01:17:47,136 --> 01:17:48,582
Rachel?

884
01:17:49,903 --> 01:17:52,820
Looks like someone's been
burning the candle at both ends.

885
01:17:52,855 --> 01:17:55,702
- Must've been quite an occasion.
- It is my birthday.

886
01:17:55,737 --> 01:17:59,418
I know. I'm sorry I can't come tonight.
I was just dropping off your present.

887
01:17:59,453 --> 01:18:02,814
- You've got better plans?
- My boss has been missing for days...

888
01:18:02,849 --> 01:18:05,213
...which means I should
probably start by looking...

889
01:18:05,248 --> 01:18:07,101
...at the bottom of the river.
- Rachel.

890
01:18:08,252 --> 01:18:09,492
Excuse me.

891
01:18:10,983 --> 01:18:12,177
Rachel Dawes.

892
01:18:12,743 --> 01:18:16,417
Who authorized that? Get Crane down
there now. Don't take no for an answer.

893
01:18:16,452 --> 01:18:20,092
Call Dr. Lehmann, tell him we need our
own assessment to the judge by morning.

894
01:18:20,503 --> 01:18:22,220
- What's wrong?
- It's Falcone.

895
01:18:22,255 --> 01:18:25,058
Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum
on suicide watch.

896
01:18:25,093 --> 01:18:27,861
You're going to Arkham now?
It's in the Narrows, Rachel.

897
01:18:29,063 --> 01:18:30,780
You enjoy your party, Bruce.

898
01:18:30,815 --> 01:18:33,622
- Some of us have work to do.
- You be careful.

899
01:18:35,303 --> 01:18:36,816
Happy birthday.

900
01:18:55,423 --> 01:18:57,459
But, Master Wayne,
the guests will be arriving.

901
01:18:57,494 --> 01:18:59,476
Keep them happy until I arrive.

902
01:18:59,511 --> 01:19:01,459
Tell them that joke you know.

903
01:19:38,703 --> 01:19:40,341
Having fun?

904
01:19:42,383 --> 01:19:45,819
Bill? Now, what's a big shot like you
doing in a place like this?

905
01:19:45,854 --> 01:19:47,176
I need some information.

906
01:19:47,211 --> 01:19:51,979
The Wayne Enterprise 47-B, 1-ME.

907
01:19:53,223 --> 01:19:54,621
1- ME.

908
01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:58,418
It's a microwave emitter. It was designed
to vaporize an enemy's water supply.

909
01:19:58,453 --> 01:20:02,622
Rumor was they tested dispersing
water-based chemicals into the air...

910
01:20:02,657 --> 01:20:04,660
...but isn't that illegal?

911
01:20:06,303 --> 01:20:10,376
I want all the information
on the development of this project...

912
01:20:10,411 --> 01:20:14,377
...all data, files, backup disks,
on my desk right away.

913
01:20:14,743 --> 01:20:16,335
Did you lose one?

914
01:20:17,343 --> 01:20:20,813
I'm merging your department
with Archives.

915
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:23,211
And I am firing you.

916
01:20:25,263 --> 01:20:27,174
Didn't you get the memo?

917
01:20:34,103 --> 01:20:35,695
Scarecrow.

918
01:20:38,863 --> 01:20:40,660
Scarecrow.

919
01:20:43,863 --> 01:20:45,137
Scarecrow.

920
01:20:48,023 --> 01:20:50,104
Miss Dawes, this is most irregular.

921
01:20:50,139 --> 01:20:53,101
I have nothing to add
to the report I filed with the judge.

922
01:20:53,136 --> 01:20:55,378
- I have questions about your report.
- Such as?

923
01:20:55,413 --> 01:20:59,701
Isn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man
who has no history of mental illness...

924
01:20:59,736 --> 01:21:03,298
...to have a psychotic breakdown
just when he's about to be indicted?

925
01:21:03,333 --> 01:21:07,576
As you can see for yourself, there is
nothing convenient about his symptoms.

926
01:21:12,023 --> 01:21:13,376
- Scarecrow.
- What's "scarecrow"?

927
01:21:13,823 --> 01:21:17,293
Patients suffering delusional episodes
often focus their paranoia...

928
01:21:17,328 --> 01:21:19,464
...on an external tormentor...

929
01:21:19,499 --> 01:21:22,735
...usually one conforming
to Jungian archetypes.

930
01:21:22,943 --> 01:21:25,252
In this case, a scarecrow.

931
01:21:26,663 --> 01:21:30,622
- He's drugged?
- Psychopharmacology is my primary field.

932
01:21:30,657 --> 01:21:32,614
I'm a strong advocate.

933
01:21:32,983 --> 01:21:35,064
Outside, he was a giant.

934
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:37,618
In here, only the mind
can grant you power.

935
01:21:37,653 --> 01:21:39,420
You enjoy the reversal.

936
01:21:39,455 --> 01:21:42,501
I respect the mind's power
over the body.

937
01:21:42,536 --> 01:21:44,107
It's why I do what I do.

938
01:21:44,142 --> 01:21:48,238
I do what I do to keep thugs like Falcone
behind bars, not in therapy.

939
01:21:48,273 --> 01:21:52,334
I want my own psychiatric consultant
to have full access to Falcone...

940
01:21:52,369 --> 01:21:55,700
...including blood work.
Find out what exactly you put him on.

941
01:21:55,735 --> 01:21:58,217
- First thing tomorrow, then.
- Tonight.

942
01:21:58,252 --> 01:22:01,733
I've already paged Dr. Lehmann
at County General.

943
01:22:03,063 --> 01:22:04,815
As you wish.

944
01:22:10,103 --> 01:22:11,945
This way, please.

945
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:14,657
There's something
I think you should see.

946
01:22:25,103 --> 01:22:27,617
This is where we make the medicine.

947
01:22:34,143 --> 01:22:37,897
Perhaps you should have some,
clear your head.

948
01:23:02,103 --> 01:23:03,661
Who knows you're here?

949
01:23:04,663 --> 01:23:06,221
Who knows?

950
01:23:13,143 --> 01:23:14,420
He's here.

951
01:23:14,455 --> 01:23:15,662
Who?

952
01:23:15,697 --> 01:23:17,740
The Batman.

953
01:23:19,463 --> 01:23:21,294
What do we do?
- What anyone does...

954
01:23:21,329 --> 01:23:24,136
...when a prowler comes around.

955
01:23:25,023 --> 01:23:27,491
- Call the police.
- You want the cops here?

956
01:23:28,023 --> 01:23:30,661
At this point, they can't stop us.

957
01:23:30,696 --> 01:23:34,218
But the Batman
has a talent for disruption.

958
01:23:34,253 --> 01:23:36,973
Force him outside,
the police will take him down. Go.

959
01:23:37,008 --> 01:23:39,693
What about her?
She hasn't got long.

960
01:23:39,728 --> 01:23:41,705
I gave her a concentrated dose.

961
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:44,371
The mind can only take so much.
Now go.

962
01:23:46,783 --> 01:23:48,978
The things they say about him.

963
01:23:49,013 --> 01:23:50,587
Can he really fly?

964
01:23:50,622 --> 01:23:53,238
I heard he can disappear.

965
01:23:53,273 --> 01:23:55,855
Well, we'll find out.

966
01:23:56,103 --> 01:23:57,695
Won't we?

967
01:24:43,063 --> 01:24:45,133
Taste of your own medicine, doctor?

968
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:53,300
What have you been doing here?

969
01:24:56,263 --> 01:24:58,572
Who are you working for?

970
01:25:02,823 --> 01:25:05,063
Ra's... Ra's al Ghul.

971
01:25:05,098 --> 01:25:09,939
Ra's al Ghul is dead.
Who are you working for?

972
01:25:09,974 --> 01:25:11,092
Crane.

973
01:25:13,463 --> 01:25:16,296
Dr. Crane isn't here right now.

974
01:25:16,823 --> 01:25:18,654
But if you'd like to make
an appointment...

975
01:25:31,143 --> 01:25:33,941
Batman,
put down your weapons and surrender.

976
01:25:34,623 --> 01:25:35,976
You're surrounded.

977
01:25:41,303 --> 01:25:43,976
- What are you waiting for?
- Backup.

978
01:25:44,663 --> 01:25:46,937
- Backup?
- The Batman's in there.

979
01:25:46,972 --> 01:25:49,213
SWAT's on the way.
But if you wanna go in now...

980
01:25:49,248 --> 01:25:50,862
...I'll be right behind you, sir.

981
01:25:52,303 --> 01:25:53,782
SWAT's on the way.

982
01:25:54,823 --> 01:25:56,051
- Hey.
- Hey.

983
01:26:36,823 --> 01:26:38,461
What's happened to her?

984
01:26:41,023 --> 01:26:44,652
Crane poisoned her with a psychotropic
hallucinogen, a panic-inducing toxin.

985
01:26:46,583 --> 01:26:50,178
- Let me get her down to the medics.
- They can't help her, but I can.

986
01:26:53,943 --> 01:26:56,013
Get her downstairs.
Meet me in the alley.

987
01:27:03,663 --> 01:27:06,416
Crane's been smuggling his toxin
hidden in Falcone's drugs...

988
01:27:06,451 --> 01:27:08,653
...and they're dumping it
into the water supply.

989
01:27:09,143 --> 01:27:10,735
- What was he planning?
- I don't know.

990
01:27:10,943 --> 01:27:12,217
Was he working for Falcone?

991
01:27:12,663 --> 01:27:15,062
He mentioned someone else,
someone worse.

992
01:27:15,097 --> 01:27:17,731
She needs the antidote
before the damage is permanent.

993
01:27:17,766 --> 01:27:20,019
- How long does she have?
- Not long.

994
01:27:23,743 --> 01:27:25,461
What is that?

995
01:27:26,783 --> 01:27:28,978
- Backup.
- What the...?

996
01:28:43,983 --> 01:28:45,462
Excuse me.

997
01:28:50,023 --> 01:28:53,140
How is she?
- She's fading. We gotta go.

998
01:28:54,903 --> 01:28:56,267
I'll get my car.

999
01:28:56,302 --> 01:28:58,215
I brought mine.

1000
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:00,175
Yours?

1001
01:29:09,103 --> 01:29:10,855
I've gotta get me one of those.

1002
01:29:11,343 --> 01:29:12,582
He is in a vehicle.

1003
01:29:12,617 --> 01:29:14,575
Make and color?

1004
01:29:14,610 --> 01:29:16,533
It's a black...

1005
01:29:17,783 --> 01:29:19,057
...tank.

1006
01:29:21,583 --> 01:29:22,902
Stay calm.

1007
01:29:23,543 --> 01:29:25,261
You've been poisoned.

1008
01:29:27,863 --> 01:29:29,137
I'm on him.

1009
01:29:37,183 --> 01:29:38,218
Breathe slowly.

1010
01:29:47,903 --> 01:29:48,972
Hold on.

1011
01:30:02,863 --> 01:30:04,182
- What are you doing?
- Shortcut.

1012
01:30:11,943 --> 01:30:14,537
Air One to ground, block that ramp.

1013
01:30:18,423 --> 01:30:19,981
He's got no way off that roof.

1014
01:30:21,303 --> 01:30:24,295
Turn off your engine.
Step away from the car.

1015
01:30:26,543 --> 01:30:29,216
- Trust me.
Weapons system activated.

1016
01:30:46,383 --> 01:30:47,337
Who is this guy?

1017
01:30:47,372 --> 01:30:48,832
Where's he going?

1018
01:30:48,867 --> 01:30:50,292
He's on the roof.

1019
01:31:03,383 --> 01:31:05,943
What street is he taking?
- He's not on a street.

1020
01:31:05,978 --> 01:31:07,331
He's flying on rooftops.

1021
01:31:44,943 --> 01:31:47,093
At least tell me what it looks like.

1022
01:31:49,983 --> 01:31:51,382
Never mind.

1023
01:31:55,103 --> 01:31:56,422
Got him.

1024
01:32:06,863 --> 01:32:08,376
Coming right up on his butt.

1025
01:32:32,063 --> 01:32:35,135
We're tracking suspect
vehicle heading west on I-17.

1026
01:32:39,463 --> 01:32:41,066
- Air One to ground.
- I lost him.

1027
01:32:41,101 --> 01:32:43,219
We've lost visual. Exit 9 is blocked.

1028
01:32:43,254 --> 01:32:45,254
We'll loop back to check
the frontage road.

1029
01:32:45,289 --> 01:32:47,334
Stealth mode activated.

1030
01:32:47,943 --> 01:32:49,137
Stay with me.

1031
01:32:55,063 --> 01:32:56,496
What...? There he is.

1032
01:33:15,383 --> 01:33:16,782
Just hold on.

1033
01:33:20,583 --> 01:33:21,732
Rachel!

1034
01:33:52,543 --> 01:33:54,579
They get any of this into the mains?

1035
01:33:54,614 --> 01:33:55,697
Yeah.

1036
01:33:55,732 --> 01:33:58,537
Notify the water company.
There's gotta be a way to isolate it.

1037
01:33:58,572 --> 01:34:01,308
No. They put it all in.
They must've been at this for weeks.

1038
01:34:01,343 --> 01:34:04,859
- Gotham's entire water supply is laced.
- Why haven't we felt the effects?

1039
01:34:04,894 --> 01:34:07,218
Must be a compound that
has to be absorbed through the lungs.

1040
01:34:17,023 --> 01:34:18,661
How do you feel?

1041
01:34:21,303 --> 01:34:22,736
Where are we?

1042
01:34:23,223 --> 01:34:26,852
- Why did you bring me here?
- If I hadn't, your mind would be lost.

1043
01:34:26,887 --> 01:34:28,944
- You were poisoned.
- It was...

1044
01:34:28,979 --> 01:34:32,613
- It was Dr. Crane.
- Rest. Gordon has Crane.

1045
01:34:32,648 --> 01:34:34,819
Is Sergeant Gordon your friend?

1046
01:34:35,623 --> 01:34:37,215
I don't have the luxury of friends.

1047
01:34:38,063 --> 01:34:41,225
I'm gonna give you a sedative.
You'll wake up back at home.

1048
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:45,211
When you do, get these to Gordon,
and Gordon alone. Trust no one.

1049
01:34:45,246 --> 01:34:47,020
- What are they?
- The antidote.

1050
01:34:47,055 --> 01:34:50,420
One for Gordon to inoculate himself,
the other for mass production.

1051
01:34:50,783 --> 01:34:51,976
Mass production?

1052
01:34:52,011 --> 01:34:55,220
Crane was just a pawn.
We need to be ready.

1053
01:35:20,103 --> 01:35:23,344
When you told me your grand plan
for saving Gotham...

1054
01:35:23,379 --> 01:35:26,341
...all that stopped me
from calling the men in white coats...

1055
01:35:26,376 --> 01:35:28,892
...was when you said
it wasn't about thrill-seeking.

1056
01:35:28,927 --> 01:35:31,975
- It's not.
- What would you call that?

1057
01:35:33,743 --> 01:35:36,880
- Damn good television.
- It's a miracle no one was killed.

1058
01:35:36,915 --> 01:35:40,018
I didn't have time to observe
the rules of the road, Alfred.

1059
01:35:40,053 --> 01:35:43,140
You're getting lost inside
this monster of yours.

1060
01:35:43,175 --> 01:35:47,575
I'm using this monster to help
other people, just like my father did.

1061
01:35:47,610 --> 01:35:49,221
For Thomas Wayne, helping others...

1062
01:35:49,256 --> 01:35:52,221
...wasn't about proving anything
to anyone, including himself.

1063
01:35:52,663 --> 01:35:55,894
It's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying.

1064
01:35:56,303 --> 01:35:58,817
She's downstairs, sedated.
I need you to take her home.

1065
01:35:59,103 --> 01:36:02,573
Well, we both care for Rachel, but what
you're doing has to be beyond that.

1066
01:36:02,863 --> 01:36:05,661
It can't be personal,
or you're just a vigilante.

1067
01:36:05,696 --> 01:36:07,535
- Is Fox still here?
- Yes, sir.

1068
01:36:07,570 --> 01:36:09,340
We need to send these people away.

1069
01:36:09,375 --> 01:36:12,376
Those are Bruce Wayne's guests.
You have a name to maintain.

1070
01:36:12,411 --> 01:36:14,260
I don't care about my name.

1071
01:36:14,295 --> 01:36:17,500
It's not just your name, sir.
It's your father's name.

1072
01:36:19,183 --> 01:36:21,458
And it's all that's left of him.

1073
01:36:23,303 --> 01:36:24,816
Don't destroy it.

1074
01:36:39,503 --> 01:36:41,573
- Mr. Earle.
- Happy birthday, Bruce.

1075
01:36:41,608 --> 01:36:43,096
Thank you.

1076
01:36:43,383 --> 01:36:45,339
How did the stock offering go?

1077
01:36:45,583 --> 01:36:46,840
Prices soared.

1078
01:36:46,875 --> 01:36:48,062
Who was buying?

1079
01:36:48,097 --> 01:36:50,094
All kinds of funds and brokerages.

1080
01:36:50,129 --> 01:36:51,915
It's a bit technical.

1081
01:36:51,950 --> 01:36:53,666
The key thing is...

1082
01:36:53,701 --> 01:36:55,774
...our company's future is secure.

1083
01:36:57,543 --> 01:36:58,532
Great.

1084
01:37:11,703 --> 01:37:13,898
A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid.

1085
01:37:19,383 --> 01:37:21,066
What was the plan, Crane?

1086
01:37:21,101 --> 01:37:23,413
How were you gonna get
your toxin into the air?

1087
01:37:23,783 --> 01:37:26,899
Scarecrow. Scarecrow.

1088
01:37:26,934 --> 01:37:28,855
Who were you working for, Crane?

1089
01:37:30,863 --> 01:37:32,979
Oh, it's too late.

1090
01:37:33,543 --> 01:37:35,579
You can't stop it now.

1091
01:37:40,423 --> 01:37:41,867
Here.

1092
01:37:41,902 --> 01:37:44,054
Happy birthday, Bruce.
- Thank you. Thanks.

1093
01:37:44,089 --> 01:37:46,942
And thank you for that item.

1094
01:37:48,383 --> 01:37:49,542
You're welcome.

1095
01:37:49,577 --> 01:37:52,416
- I know you'll put it to good use.
- I already have.

1096
01:37:52,663 --> 01:37:56,338
How long would it take
to manufacture on a large scale?

1097
01:37:56,863 --> 01:37:57,897
Weeks. Why?

1098
01:37:57,932 --> 01:38:01,140
Somebody's planning to disperse
the toxin using the water supply.

1099
01:38:02,103 --> 01:38:05,061
The water supply won't help you
disperse an inhalant.

1100
01:38:05,943 --> 01:38:07,261
What?

1101
01:38:07,296 --> 01:38:09,897
Unless you have a microwave emitter
powerful enough...

1102
01:38:09,932 --> 01:38:12,816
...to vaporize all the water
in the mains.

1103
01:38:13,223 --> 01:38:16,374
A microwave emitter like the one
Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.

1104
01:38:16,783 --> 01:38:17,897
Misplaced?

1105
01:38:17,932 --> 01:38:21,459
Earle just fired me for asking
too many questions about it.

1106
01:38:23,383 --> 01:38:26,739
Go back to Wayne Enterprises now
and start making more of that antidote.

1107
01:38:26,774 --> 01:38:29,895
The police are gonna need as much
as they can get their hands on.

1108
01:38:29,930 --> 01:38:32,019
My security clearance
has been revoked.

1109
01:38:32,054 --> 01:38:34,134
That wouldn't stop a man like you,
would it?

1110
01:38:34,543 --> 01:38:36,181
I suppose not.

1111
01:38:38,143 --> 01:38:42,614
- Bruce, there's somebody you must meet.
- Not now, Mrs. Delane.

1112
01:38:42,649 --> 01:38:45,536
Now, am I pronouncing this right...

1113
01:38:45,571 --> 01:38:48,058
...Mr. Ra's al Ghul?

1114
01:38:53,463 --> 01:38:55,181
You're not Ra's al Ghul.

1115
01:38:56,663 --> 01:38:57,856
I watched him die.

1116
01:38:57,891 --> 01:39:00,975
But is Ra's al Ghul immortal?

1117
01:39:03,623 --> 01:39:05,978
Are his methods supernatural?

1118
01:39:10,343 --> 01:39:14,575
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal
your true identity, Ra's?

1119
01:39:16,343 --> 01:39:20,655
Surely a man who spends his nights
scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...

1120
01:39:20,690 --> 01:39:22,779
...wouldn't begrudge me dual identities.

1121
01:39:23,583 --> 01:39:25,266
I saved your life.

1122
01:39:25,301 --> 01:39:27,852
I warned you about compassion, Bruce.

1123
01:39:30,903 --> 01:39:33,019
Your quarrel is with me.

1124
01:39:33,863 --> 01:39:36,252
You let these people go.

1125
01:39:36,503 --> 01:39:39,654
You are welcome to explain
the situation to them.

1126
01:39:41,823 --> 01:39:43,381
Everyone.

1127
01:39:44,143 --> 01:39:45,940
Everybody?

1128
01:39:48,423 --> 01:39:50,220
I...

1129
01:39:50,663 --> 01:39:54,736
I want to thank you all for coming here
tonight and drinking all of my booze.

1130
01:39:56,743 --> 01:39:58,381
No, really.

1131
01:39:59,383 --> 01:40:01,987
There's a thing about being a Wayne...

1132
01:40:02,022 --> 01:40:05,660
...that you're never short of
a few freeloaders, like yourselves...

1133
01:40:05,695 --> 01:40:09,298
...to fill up your mansion with.
So here's to you people. Thank you.

1134
01:40:09,333 --> 01:40:11,977
- That's enough, Bruce.
- I'm not finished.

1135
01:40:12,303 --> 01:40:13,906
To all of you...

1136
01:40:13,941 --> 01:40:18,266
All of you phonies,
all of you two-faced friends...

1137
01:40:18,301 --> 01:40:23,332
...you sycophantic suck-ups
who smile through your teeth at me...

1138
01:40:23,367 --> 01:40:26,939
...please, leave me in peace.

1139
01:40:26,974 --> 01:40:29,617
Please go.

1140
01:40:29,943 --> 01:40:33,219
Stop smiling, it's not a joke.
Please leave.

1141
01:40:33,254 --> 01:40:35,464
The party's over, get out.

1142
01:40:35,499 --> 01:40:38,780
The apple has fallen very far
from the tree, Mr. Wayne.

1143
01:40:43,423 --> 01:40:45,618
He's turning into a jerk.

1144
01:40:51,663 --> 01:40:53,335
Amusing.

1145
01:40:53,623 --> 01:40:56,933
But pointless.
None of these people have long to live.

1146
01:40:56,968 --> 01:41:00,459
Your antics at the asylum
have forced my hand.

1147
01:41:00,494 --> 01:41:02,658
So Crane was working for you.

1148
01:41:02,693 --> 01:41:06,538
His toxin is derived from the organic
compound found in our blue flowers.

1149
01:41:06,863 --> 01:41:08,784
He was able to weaponize it.

1150
01:41:08,819 --> 01:41:10,859
He's not a member of
the League of Shadows?

1151
01:41:10,894 --> 01:41:15,420
Of course not. He thought our plan
was to hold the city to ransom.

1152
01:41:16,103 --> 01:41:20,460
But really, you are gonna release
Crane's poison on the entire city.

1153
01:41:20,495 --> 01:41:24,502
Then watch Gotham tear itself apart
through fear.

1154
01:41:36,623 --> 01:41:38,659
You're gonna destroy millions of lives.

1155
01:41:38,863 --> 01:41:42,173
Only a cynical man would call
what these people have "lives," Wayne.

1156
01:41:42,208 --> 01:41:43,946
Crime. Despair.

1157
01:41:43,981 --> 01:41:46,134
This is not how man
was supposed to live.

1158
01:41:46,743 --> 01:41:49,780
The League of Shadows has been
a check against human corruption...

1159
01:41:49,815 --> 01:41:51,341
...for thousands of years.

1160
01:41:51,376 --> 01:41:54,979
We sacked Rome.
Loaded trade ships with plague rats.

1161
01:41:55,014 --> 01:41:56,461
Burned London to the ground.

1162
01:41:56,496 --> 01:41:59,382
Every time a civilization reaches
the pinnacle of its decadence...

1163
01:41:59,417 --> 01:42:01,420
...we return to restore the balance.

1164
01:42:01,455 --> 01:42:03,096
Gotham isn't beyond saving.

1165
01:42:04,343 --> 01:42:06,937
Give me more time.
There are good people here.

1166
01:42:06,972 --> 01:42:08,820
You're defending a city so corrupt...

1167
01:42:08,855 --> 01:42:12,060
...we have infiltrated
every level of its infrastructure.

1168
01:42:22,703 --> 01:42:24,022
Time to play.

1169
01:42:28,023 --> 01:42:30,583
When I found you in that jail,
you were lost.

1170
01:42:30,618 --> 01:42:32,744
But I believed in you.

1171
01:42:32,779 --> 01:42:36,538
I took away your fear,
and I showed you a path.

1172
01:42:36,783 --> 01:42:38,933
You were my greatest student.

1173
01:42:39,223 --> 01:42:42,260
It should be you standing by my side,
saving the world.

1174
01:42:43,023 --> 01:42:45,537
I'll be standing where I belong.

1175
01:42:46,143 --> 01:42:49,135
Between you
and the people of Gotham.

1176
01:42:50,743 --> 01:42:53,257
No one can save Gotham.

1177
01:42:56,463 --> 01:43:00,934
When a forest grows too wild,
a purging fire is inevitable and natural.

1178
01:43:02,103 --> 01:43:06,574
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror
as its greatest city destroys itself.

1179
01:43:07,103 --> 01:43:10,220
The movement back to harmony
will be unstoppable this time.

1180
01:43:10,503 --> 01:43:12,619
- You attacked Gotham before?
- Of course.

1181
01:43:12,823 --> 01:43:15,383
Over the ages our weapons
have grown more sophisticated.

1182
01:43:15,418 --> 01:43:18,296
With Gotham we tried a new one.
Economics.

1183
01:43:18,703 --> 01:43:23,219
But we underestimated certain
of Gotham's citizens...

1184
01:43:23,623 --> 01:43:25,739
...such as your parents.

1185
01:43:29,623 --> 01:43:32,979
Gunned down by one of the very people
they were trying to help.

1186
01:43:33,223 --> 01:43:35,820
Create enough hunger
and everyone becomes a criminal.

1187
01:43:35,855 --> 01:43:38,418
Their deaths galvanized the city
into saving itself...

1188
01:43:38,453 --> 01:43:41,177
...and Gotham has limped on
ever since.

1189
01:43:41,212 --> 01:43:43,061
We are back to finish the job.

1190
01:43:43,743 --> 01:43:46,825
And this time no misguided idealists
will get in the way.

1191
01:43:46,860 --> 01:43:50,459
Like your father, you lack the courage
to do all that is necessary.

1192
01:43:50,743 --> 01:43:53,461
If someone stands in the way
of true justice...

1193
01:43:53,496 --> 01:43:57,576
...you simply walk up behind them
and stab them in the heart.

1194
01:44:02,383 --> 01:44:04,453
- I am gonna stop you.
- You never did learn...

1195
01:44:04,488 --> 01:44:06,579
...to mind your surroundings.

1196
01:44:08,663 --> 01:44:10,539
Justice is balance.

1197
01:44:10,574 --> 01:44:12,813
You burned my house
and left me for dead.

1198
01:44:15,383 --> 01:44:17,453
Consider us even.

1199
01:44:33,183 --> 01:44:34,855
No one comes out. Make sure.

1200
01:44:44,343 --> 01:44:45,707
They're all gone?

1201
01:44:45,742 --> 01:44:48,542
- How many from maximum security?
- Every one of them.

1202
01:44:48,577 --> 01:44:50,421
Serial killers, rapists.

1203
01:44:50,623 --> 01:44:53,342
Raise the bridges.
We don't want any getting off the island.

1204
01:44:53,377 --> 01:44:55,060
Yeah, I'll raise the bridges...

1205
01:44:55,095 --> 01:44:59,142
...when I get every available unit out here
to catch the homicidal maniacs...

1206
01:44:59,177 --> 01:45:02,056
...that are running loose out there.
- Come on!

1207
01:45:24,303 --> 01:45:26,942
I hope you're not a member
of the fire brigade.

1208
01:45:32,703 --> 01:45:34,739
Master Wayne! Master Wayne!

1209
01:45:39,063 --> 01:45:43,261
What is the point of all those pushups
if you can't even lift a bloody log?

1210
01:46:20,143 --> 01:46:22,134
What have I done, Alfred?

1211
01:46:23,103 --> 01:46:25,038
Everything my family...

1212
01:46:25,073 --> 01:46:26,974
...my father, built...

1213
01:46:29,263 --> 01:46:33,017
The Wayne legacy is more
than bricks and mortar, sir.

1214
01:46:33,052 --> 01:46:35,333
I wanted to save Gotham.

1215
01:46:36,143 --> 01:46:37,940
I failed.

1216
01:46:39,103 --> 01:46:40,331
Why do we fall, sir?

1217
01:46:43,383 --> 01:46:46,739
So that we can learn
to pick ourselves up.

1218
01:46:49,103 --> 01:46:51,173
You still haven't given up on me?

1219
01:46:52,983 --> 01:46:54,416
Never.

1220
01:46:55,423 --> 01:46:56,662
Down!

1221
01:46:56,697 --> 01:46:59,626
Harassment! I see harassment!

1222
01:46:59,661 --> 01:47:01,814
Maybe you'd like to see
some excessive force?

1223
01:47:01,849 --> 01:47:03,814
Madman with a gun.

1224
01:47:04,823 --> 01:47:06,426
With residents furious...

1225
01:47:06,461 --> 01:47:09,660
...at the unprecedented show of police
strength to round up the inmates...

1226
01:47:09,695 --> 01:47:11,540
We're about to raise these bridges.

1227
01:47:11,575 --> 01:47:15,213
Officer, I am a Gotham City
district attorney. Let me pass.

1228
01:47:22,303 --> 01:47:24,199
- Just shut up!
- Hey, Flass, cool it!

1229
01:47:24,234 --> 01:47:26,061
Hold these people back.

1230
01:47:26,096 --> 01:47:28,901
Hey, Gordon.
Somebody here to see you.

1231
01:47:28,936 --> 01:47:31,412
- What are you doing here?
- Our friend sent me with this.

1232
01:47:31,447 --> 01:47:33,011
It counteracts Crane's toxin.

1233
01:47:33,046 --> 01:47:34,541
Hopefully you won't need it.

1234
01:47:34,576 --> 01:47:37,780
Not unless he's got some way
of getting that crap into the air.

1235
01:47:38,863 --> 01:47:41,218
All right, last one across.

1236
01:47:41,863 --> 01:47:45,582
People, they want this
bridge up in no more than three minutes!

1237
01:47:45,617 --> 01:47:49,059
Better get you off the island before
they raise the bridges. Patrolman!

1238
01:47:49,663 --> 01:47:50,652
Go!

1239
01:48:16,343 --> 01:48:18,095
I can't find my mom.

1240
01:48:18,423 --> 01:48:19,856
Hey!

1241
01:48:27,903 --> 01:48:29,575
What the hell are you doing?

1242
01:48:31,023 --> 01:48:32,536
Gentlemen...

1243
01:48:32,943 --> 01:48:35,377
...time to spread the word.

1244
01:48:37,023 --> 01:48:38,376
And the word is...

1245
01:48:39,543 --> 01:48:41,261
...panic.

1246
01:49:04,263 --> 01:49:05,742
Jesus. The pressure, it's spiking.

1247
01:49:06,892 --> 01:49:08,132
Right there.

1248
01:49:08,423 --> 01:49:10,573
That water main
is right under the Narrows.

1249
01:49:26,823 --> 01:49:28,336
It's okay.

1250
01:49:59,823 --> 01:50:01,462
This is Commissioner Loeb.

1251
01:50:01,497 --> 01:50:03,101
Come on, somebody talk to me.

1252
01:50:03,136 --> 01:50:04,662
Come on!

1253
01:50:23,543 --> 01:50:25,499
Loeb, Loeb. This is Gordon.

1254
01:50:25,783 --> 01:50:27,022
What the hell is going on?

1255
01:50:27,057 --> 01:50:30,498
We need reinforcements.
TAC teams, SWAT, riot cops!

1256
01:50:30,533 --> 01:50:33,998
Gordon! All the city's riot police
are on the island with you!

1257
01:50:34,033 --> 01:50:37,428
Well, they're completely incapacitated!

1258
01:50:37,463 --> 01:50:40,979
It's okay, it's okay.
No one's gonna hurt you.

1259
01:50:41,783 --> 01:50:43,340
Of course they are!

1260
01:50:43,375 --> 01:50:46,421
- Crane?
- No. Scarecrow.

1261
01:50:48,103 --> 01:50:49,421
Gordon...

1262
01:50:49,456 --> 01:50:51,773
...there's nobody left to send in.

1263
01:50:53,263 --> 01:50:54,901
So I'm on my own?

1264
01:50:58,823 --> 01:51:00,380
The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces.

1265
01:51:00,415 --> 01:51:03,138
This is just the beginning.
If they hit the whole city...

1266
01:51:03,173 --> 01:51:05,862
...there's nothing to stop Gotham
tearing itself apart.

1267
01:51:05,897 --> 01:51:07,819
- How are they gonna do that?
- The train.

1268
01:51:07,854 --> 01:51:11,698
The monorail follows the water mains to
the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.

1269
01:51:11,733 --> 01:51:13,466
If the machine gets to the station...

1270
01:51:13,501 --> 01:51:17,019
...it'll cause a chain reaction
that'll vaporize the city's water supply.

1271
01:51:17,054 --> 01:51:18,661
Covering Gotham in this poison.

1272
01:51:18,696 --> 01:51:21,935
I'm gonna stop him from loading
that train, but I may need your help.

1273
01:51:21,970 --> 01:51:23,821
- What do you need?
- Can you drive stick?

1274
01:51:29,823 --> 01:51:31,380
There you are!

1275
01:51:31,415 --> 01:51:33,494
There is nothing to fear...

1276
01:51:33,529 --> 01:51:35,335
...but fear itself!

1277
01:51:36,343 --> 01:51:38,015
I am here to help you!

1278
01:52:08,503 --> 01:52:10,573
Batman will save us. He'll come.

1279
01:52:15,583 --> 01:52:17,414
- He'll come.
- Don't peek.

1280
01:52:25,703 --> 01:52:28,934
This is Gordon.
Prepare to lower the bridge.

1281
01:52:34,583 --> 01:52:36,619
I told you he'd come.

1282
01:52:41,423 --> 01:52:42,981
Wait.

1283
01:52:43,903 --> 01:52:45,426
You could die.

1284
01:52:45,461 --> 01:52:46,851
At least tell me your name.

1285
01:52:52,023 --> 01:52:54,139
It's not who I am underneath...

1286
01:52:55,063 --> 01:52:59,295
...but what I do that defines me.

1287
01:52:59,543 --> 01:53:00,817
Bruce?

1288
01:53:33,143 --> 01:53:36,340
Well, well. You took my advice
about theatricality a bit literally.

1289
01:53:36,375 --> 01:53:38,834
- It ends here.
- For you and the police, maybe.

1290
01:53:38,869 --> 01:53:41,764
My fight, however,
lies with the rest of Gotham.

1291
01:53:41,799 --> 01:53:45,085
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a city to destroy.

1292
01:53:45,120 --> 01:53:48,372
- I can't beat two of your pawns?
- As you wish.

1293
01:54:00,663 --> 01:54:02,893
GPS online.

1294
01:54:09,463 --> 01:54:11,579
In 100 yards.

1295
01:54:41,183 --> 01:54:42,411
Gentlemen.

1296
01:55:08,703 --> 01:55:10,853
Who the hell authorized this?

1297
01:55:20,983 --> 01:55:22,974
Distance to Wayne Tower, three miles.

1298
01:55:29,943 --> 01:55:32,457
The pressure's moving along the mains,
blowing the pipes.

1299
01:55:32,492 --> 01:55:33,907
If that pressure reaches us...

1300
01:55:33,942 --> 01:55:36,981
...the water supply right across
the whole city is gonna blow!

1301
01:55:47,023 --> 01:55:49,776
At the next intersection, turn right.

1302
01:56:13,463 --> 01:56:14,862
You will never learn.

1303
01:56:22,103 --> 01:56:23,092
Sorry.

1304
01:56:26,903 --> 01:56:29,781
- Familiar. Don't you have anything new?
- How about this?!

1305
01:56:45,863 --> 01:56:48,058
You have arrived at Wayne Tower.

1306
01:57:00,823 --> 01:57:02,017
Evacuate the building.

1307
01:57:02,223 --> 01:57:04,612
We're on top of the main hub
and it's gonna blow.

1308
01:57:13,143 --> 01:57:15,259
Weapons system activated.

1309
01:57:19,183 --> 01:57:20,172
Nice ride.

1310
01:57:34,783 --> 01:57:35,772
Armed.

1311
01:57:47,223 --> 01:57:48,622
Don't be afraid, Bruce.

1312
01:57:51,303 --> 01:57:52,622
Come on. Come on.

1313
01:57:57,183 --> 01:57:59,139
You are just an ordinary man in a cape.

1314
01:57:59,174 --> 01:58:03,052
That's why you couldn't fight injustice,
that's why you can't stop this train.

1315
01:58:03,087 --> 01:58:05,691
Who said anything about stopping it?

1316
01:58:11,263 --> 01:58:12,742
Yes!

1317
01:58:20,583 --> 01:58:23,859
You never learned
to mind your surroundings!

1318
01:58:31,383 --> 01:58:33,772
Have you finally learned to do
what is necessary?

1319
01:58:34,063 --> 01:58:36,258
I won't kill you...

1320
01:58:40,503 --> 01:58:42,573
...but I don't have to save you.

1321
01:59:54,663 --> 01:59:57,621
The meeting's already started.
- What meeting?

1322
02:00:01,703 --> 02:00:04,501
Fox, I seem to remember firing you.

1323
02:00:04,983 --> 02:00:06,461
You did.

1324
02:00:06,496 --> 02:00:08,654
I got another job.

1325
02:00:09,463 --> 02:00:10,862
Yours.

1326
02:00:11,303 --> 02:00:12,941
On whose authority?

1327
02:00:13,423 --> 02:00:15,344
Batman may
have made the front page...

1328
02:00:15,379 --> 02:00:18,376
...but Bruce Wayne
got pushed to page eight.

1329
02:00:24,903 --> 02:00:25,857
Bruce Wayne.

1330
02:00:25,892 --> 02:00:29,254
What makes you think you can decide
who's running Wayne Enterprises?

1331
02:00:29,289 --> 02:00:32,616
- The fact that I'm the owner.
What are you talking about?

1332
02:00:32,651 --> 02:00:34,396
The company went public a week ago.

1333
02:00:34,431 --> 02:00:36,142
And I bought most of the shares.

1334
02:00:36,503 --> 02:00:39,813
Through various charitable foundations
and trusts and so forth.

1335
02:00:39,848 --> 02:00:43,055
Look, it's all a bit technical,
but the important thing...

1336
02:00:43,263 --> 02:00:46,414
...is that my company's future
is secure.

1337
02:00:46,783 --> 02:00:48,101
Right, Mr. Fox?

1338
02:00:48,136 --> 02:00:50,055
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.

1339
02:00:52,183 --> 02:00:53,696
Didn't you get the memo?

1340
02:01:11,863 --> 02:01:14,935
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Rachel.
- No. No, Bruce...

1341
02:01:14,970 --> 02:01:16,422
...I'm sorry.

1342
02:01:17,263 --> 02:01:19,823
The day that Chill died, I...

1343
02:01:21,623 --> 02:01:23,181
I said terrible things.

1344
02:01:23,663 --> 02:01:25,335
But true things.

1345
02:01:25,943 --> 02:01:27,660
I was a coward with a gun...

1346
02:01:27,695 --> 02:01:31,492
...and justice is about more
than revenge, so thank you.

1347
02:01:32,503 --> 02:01:35,063
I never stopped thinking about you.

1348
02:01:36,503 --> 02:01:38,061
About us.

1349
02:01:38,663 --> 02:01:40,540
And when I heard you were back, I...

1350
02:01:41,343 --> 02:01:43,459
I started to hope.

1351
02:02:06,543 --> 02:02:09,137
But then I found out about your mask.

1352
02:02:10,263 --> 02:02:12,982
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.

1353
02:02:13,583 --> 02:02:15,175
No. This...

1354
02:02:16,303 --> 02:02:17,941
...is your mask.

1355
02:02:19,823 --> 02:02:23,213
Your real face is the one
that criminals now fear.

1356
02:02:24,023 --> 02:02:25,934
The man I loved...

1357
02:02:26,623 --> 02:02:28,022
...the man who vanished...

1358
02:02:29,183 --> 02:02:31,253
...he never came back at all.

1359
02:02:35,543 --> 02:02:38,103
But maybe he's still
out there somewhere.

1360
02:02:40,183 --> 02:02:43,732
Maybe someday,
when Gotham no longer needs Batman...

1361
02:02:44,743 --> 02:02:46,620
...I'll see him again.

1362
02:02:57,223 --> 02:03:00,021
- Proved me wrong, you know.
- About what?

1363
02:03:02,743 --> 02:03:05,098
Your father would be very proud of you.

1364
02:03:05,303 --> 02:03:06,861
Just like me.

1365
02:03:32,743 --> 02:03:34,540
What will you do?

1366
02:03:35,863 --> 02:03:37,376
Rebuild it.

1367
02:03:38,223 --> 02:03:40,498
Just the way it was, brick for brick.

1368
02:03:47,063 --> 02:03:48,257
Just the way it was, sir?

1369
02:03:50,263 --> 02:03:51,422
Yeah, why?

1370
02:03:51,457 --> 02:03:54,342
I thought this might be
a good opportunity for...

1371
02:03:54,377 --> 02:03:56,823
...improving the foundations.

1372
02:03:56,858 --> 02:03:59,856
- In the southeast corner?
- Precisely, sir.

1373
02:04:14,903 --> 02:04:17,656
- Nice.
- I couldn't find any mob bosses.

1374
02:04:18,583 --> 02:04:21,177
Well, sergeant?
- It's "lieutenant" now.

1375
02:04:21,503 --> 02:04:23,258
You really started something.

1376
02:04:23,293 --> 02:04:25,014
Bent cops running scared.

1377
02:04:25,049 --> 02:04:26,536
Hope on the streets.

1378
02:04:26,783 --> 02:04:30,253
- But?
- The Narrows is lost.

1379
02:04:30,743 --> 02:04:34,452
And we still haven't picked up Crane or
half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.

1380
02:04:35,103 --> 02:04:36,661
We will.

1381
02:04:36,863 --> 02:04:38,420
We can bring Gotham back.

1382
02:04:38,455 --> 02:04:40,977
- What about escalation?
- Escalation?

1383
02:04:41,012 --> 02:04:45,333
We start carrying semiautomatics,
they buy automatics.

1384
02:04:45,368 --> 02:04:49,655
We start wearing Kevlar,
they buy armor-piercing rounds.

1385
02:04:49,690 --> 02:04:52,974
- And?
- And you're wearing a mask...

1386
02:04:53,383 --> 02:04:55,180
...and jumping off rooftops.

1387
02:04:56,543 --> 02:04:58,499
Now, take this guy.

1388
02:04:58,743 --> 02:05:00,664
Armed robbery, double homicide.

1389
02:05:00,699 --> 02:05:03,980
Got a taste for the theatrical, like you.

1390
02:05:04,223 --> 02:05:06,100
Leaves a calling card.

1391
02:05:11,743 --> 02:05:13,495
I'll look into it.

1392
02:05:16,823 --> 02:05:18,222
I never said thank you.

1393
02:05:23,103 --> 02:05:25,094
And you'll never have to.
