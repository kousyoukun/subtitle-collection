1
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,610


2
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,310
瑞切尔  给我看看
Rachel, let me see.

3
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
我能看看吗
Can I see?

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,500
谁找到归谁  这是我找到的
Finders keepers. And I found it.

5
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,240
这是我家的花园
In my garden.

6
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,790
谁找到归谁
Finders keepers.

7
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,250
布鲁斯
Bruce?

8
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,270
布鲁斯
Bruce?

9
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,760
妈妈  阿尔弗雷德先生
Mom! Mr. Alfred!

10
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,870
你做梦了  是吗
Did you have dream?

11
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,210
噩梦
Nightmare.

12
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,050
比这地方更可怕么
Worse than this place?

13
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,030
他们要跟你干一架
They are going to fight you.

14
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,030
- 又要打  - 直到打死你
- Again?  - Until they kill you.

15
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,040
干脆在吃早饭前打死我
Can they kill me before breakfast?

16
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,250
你下地狱了  小子
You are in hell, little man.

17
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,340
而我就是大魔王
And I am the devil.

18
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,180
你不是大魔王
You're not the devil.

19
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,720
而是沙包
You're practice.

20
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,470
关禁闭
Solitary.

21
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,560
- 为什么 - 保护犯人
- Why?   - For protection.

22
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,570
我才不需要保护
I don't need protection.

23
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,570
是保护他们
Protection for them.

24
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,280
进去
Get in.

25
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,280
打击罪犯真是迫不及待呀
Are you so desperate to fight criminals...

26
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,120
不惜把自己关进监狱跟他们单挑
...that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time?

27
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,290
其实  他们一共七个人
Actually, there were seven of them.

28
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,750
我数了  六个  韦恩先生
I counted six, Mr. Wayne.

29
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,760
你怎么知道我叫什么
How do you know my name?

30
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,970
世界太小了  像布鲁斯・韦恩这样的人不可能消失
The world is too small for someone like Bruce Wayne to disappear...

31
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,470
再怎么沉沦还是会浮出水面
...no matter how deep he chooses to sink.

32
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,800
你是谁
Who are you?

33
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,140
在下名叫杜卡达  可却代表拉斯・阿・古
My name is merely Ducard, but I speak for Ra's al Ghul

34
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,940
他是连黑帮都无比敬畏的人物
a man greatly feared by the criminal underworld.

35
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,690
他能为你指一条路
A man who can offer you a path.

36
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,110
你凭什么觉得我需要指路
What makes you think I need a path?

37
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,110
你这样的人来这是自愿的
Someone like you is only here by choice.

38
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,660
你正在探索犯罪团伙的世界
You have been exploring the criminal fraternity...

39
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,280
不过不管你当初出于什么目的
...but whatever your original intentions

40
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,330
现在你已经完全迷失了
you have become truly lost.

41
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,270
可拉斯・阿・古能指出什么样的路
And what path can Ra's al Ghul offer?

42
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,840
一条跟他们一样仇恨邪恶的路
The path of a man who shares his hatred of evil...

43
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,000
一条真正伸张正义的路
...and wishes to serve true justice.

44
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,800
一条影武者联盟之路
The path of the League of Shadows.

45
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,150
你们就是义警而已
You're vigilantes.

46
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,150
不  不  不
No, no, no.

47
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:00,520
义警惩罚罪人  只是为了满足自己的快感
A vigilante is just a man lost in the scramble for his own gratification.

48
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,360
他可能会被人击败  关进牢里
He can be destroyed or locked up.

49
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:10,530
不过  如果你能超越自己不做一个凡人
But if you make yourself more than just a man...

50
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,700
如果你让自己执著于一个信念
...if you devote yourself to an ideal...

51
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,370
如果他们无法阻止你
and if they can't stop you...

52
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,210
那你就成为了截然不同的存在
then you become something else entirely.

53
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,420
变成什么
Which is?

54
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,880
一个传奇  韦恩先生
Legend, Mr. Wayne.

55
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,840
明天  你就要出狱了
Tomorrow, you will be released.

56
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,390
如果你已厌倦与窃贼争斗  如果你想有所成就的话
If you are bored of brawling with thieves and want to achieve something

57
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,060
东边的山坡上  有一种罕见的蓝色花朵
there is a rare blue flower that grows on the eastern slopes.

58
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,890
摘下其中的一朵
Pick one of these flowers.

59
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,020
如果你能把它带到山巅之上
If you can carry it to the top of the mountain...

60
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,110
也许就能找到最初想要找的东西
you may find what you were looking for in the first place.

61
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,030
那么  我最初要找什么
And what was I looking for?

62
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,700
只有你自己知道
Only you can know that.

63
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,470
掉头回去  快回去吧
You turn back. You go back.

64
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,090
拉斯・阿・古
Ra's al Ghul?

65
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,890
慢着
Wait.

66
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,190
你在找什么
What are you seeking?

67
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,110
我在找
I seek...

68
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,900
惩恶扬善的门路
the means to fight injustice.

69
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,400
用恐惧
To turn fear...

70
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,570
去对抗那些制造恐惧的人
against those who prey on the fearful.

71
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,350
要控制别人内心的恐惧
To manipulate the fears in others...

72
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,600
首先要驾驭自己的恐惧
you must first master your own.

73
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,940
你准备好了吗
Are you ready to begin?

74
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,440
我连站都站不稳
I can I can barely stand.

75
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,940
死神不会等着你准备
Death does not wait for you to be ready!

76
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,280
死神不体谅人也不公平
Death is not considerate or fair!

77
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:25,410
你得明白  在这儿你面对的就是死神
And make no mistake, here you face death.

78
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,620
虎势
Tiger.

79
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,040
柔术
Jujitsu.

80
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,300
豹指
Panther.

81
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,140
你挺灵巧  可这不是跳舞
You're skilled. But this is not a dance.

82
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,140
你的确害怕
And you are afraid.

83
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,980
可不是怕我
But not of me.

84
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,950
告诉我们  韦恩先生
Tell us, Mr. Wayne

85
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,620
你到底害怕什么
what do you fear?

86
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,170
布鲁斯
Bruce?

87
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,340
别怕  别怕
It's okay. It's okay.

88
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,010
你没事的
You'll be okay.

89
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,560
要叫辆救护车吗  韦恩老爷
Will we be needing an ambulance, Master Wayne?

90
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,730
我帮他接骨头  然后带他照X光
No, I'll set the bone and take him for an x-ray later.

91
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,140
是  老爷
Very good, sir.

92
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,320
- 真抱歉  老爷  我说过  - 不用担心  他没事的
- I'm very sorry, sir.  I've told...  - Don't worry. It's fine.

93
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,570
摔得够呛  是吧  少爷
Took quite a fall, didn't we, Master Bruce?

94
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,030
我们为什么摔跤  布鲁斯
And why do we fall, Bruce?

95
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,450
是为了学会自己爬起来
So we can learn to pick ourselves up.

96
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,080
只受了点轻伤  轻微骨折而已
Just a little fall. It's just a small fracture.

97
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,880
又是蝙蝠吗
The bats again?

98
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,180
你知道它们为什么袭击你  不是吗
You know why they attacked you, don't you?

99
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,730
因为它们怕你
They were afraid of you.

100
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:12,730
它们怕我
Afraid of me?

101
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,890
所有生物都会害怕
All creatures feel fear.

102
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,400
那些吓人的也怕
Even the scary ones?

103
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,440
它们怕得更厉害
Especially the scary ones.

104
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,610
给你看样东西
I got something to show you.

105
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,240
你觉得你妈妈会喜欢吗
You think your mother will like them?

106
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,240
当然
Yeah.

107
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,080
该起床了吧
I think it's time to get up.

108
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,080
再睡会儿
Maybe.

109
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,870
不许赖床
No going back to bed.

110
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,210
这火车是你造的  爸
Did you build this train, Dad?

111
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:43,090
高谭市对韦恩家族很好 但这城市日渐没落
Gotham's been good to our family, but the city's been suffering.

112
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,760
那些不如我们幸运的人日子过得很艰难
People less fortunate than us have been enduring very hard times.

113
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,890
所以我们建造了 一套全新  价廉的公共交通系统连接整个城市
So we built a new, cheap, public transportation system to unite the city.

114
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,770
而城市中央
And at the center...

115
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,770
韦恩大厦
Wayne Tower.

116
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,980
你在那儿上班吗
Is that where you work?

117
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,780
不  我在医院上班
No, I work at the hospital.

118
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,190
我把公司的经营交给更能胜任的人
I leave the running of our company to much better men.

119
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,370
胜任
Better?

120
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,320
对公司更感兴趣的人
Well more interested men.

121
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,460
我们能走吗
Can we go?

122
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,340
拜托
Please.

123
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,970
好  我们走吧
Okay. Let's go.

124
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,230
怎么了  布鲁斯
What's wrong, Bruce?

125
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,030
不  不  是我要走
No, no. It was me.

126
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,360
我想吸点新鲜空气
I just needed some fresh air.

127
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,690
歌剧又长又闷真没劲  对吗  布鲁斯
A little bit of opera goes a long way. Right, Bruce?

128
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,030
好了  我们走
Come on. Let's go.

129
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,250
钱包  首饰  快交出来
Wallets, jewelry. Come on, fast.

130
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,790
- 先别急  - 快点
- That's fine.  - Fast.

131
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,120
别激动
Take it easy.

132
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
别激动
Take it easy.

133
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,010
拿去吧
Here you go.

134
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,600
没事  没事
It's fine. It's fine.

135
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,600
你可以拿去  离开
Now just take it and go.

136
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,560
- 我说首饰  - 嗨
- I said, jewelry.  - Hey

137
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,940
托马斯
Thomas!

138
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,570
布鲁斯
Bruce.

139
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,580
没事的
It's okay.

140
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,460
不要害怕
Don't be afraid.

141
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,070
是你父亲的吗
Is this your father's?

142
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,740
没事的
It's okay.

143
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,580
来吧
Come here.

144
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,500
穿好了
There you go.

145
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,810
没事的
It's okay.

146
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,310
没事的
It's okay.

147
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,810
戈登
Gordon.

148
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,480
嗨
Hey.

149
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,320
好消息
Good news.

150
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,660
我们抓到他了
We got him, son.

151
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,180
我们会全力帮你
You're in excellent hands.

152
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,010
会把公司管理好
We'll be watching the empire.

153
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,180
等你长大了  再让你接手
When you grow up, it'll be waiting for you.

154
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,330
我还准备了一些晚饭
I thought I might prepare a little supper.

155
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,510
那好吧
Very well.

156
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,590
阿尔弗雷德
Alfred?

157
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,560
怎么了  少爷
Yes, Master Bruce?

158
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,560
都是我的错
It was my fault, Alfred.

159
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,380
- 我让他们离开的  - 不不不
- I made them leave the theater.  - No.

160
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,000
要是我没害怕
lf I hadn't gotten scared...

161
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,600
这事不能怪你
It was nothing that you did.

162
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,060
都得怪他  怪那打劫的
It was him, and him alone.

163
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,060
你明白吗
Do you understand?

164
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,230
我想念他们  我可真想念他们
I miss them, Alfred. I miss them so much.

165
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,400
我也是  少爷
So do I, Master Bruce.

166
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,070
我也是
So do I.

167
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,160
你还在为你父母的死责怪自己吗
And do you still feel responsible for your parents' death?

168
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,450
愤怒超越了我的内疚
My anger outweighs my guilt.

169
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,580
来吧
Come.

170
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,960
你已经学会用愤怒埋葬内疚了
You have learned to bury your guilt with anger.

171
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,180
我要教你面对它  然后接受现实
I will teach you to confront it and to face the truth.

172
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,010
你已经知道如何战胜六个人
You know how to fight six men.

173
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,640
我们要教你如何打败600个人
We can teach you how to engage 600.

174
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,770
你知道如何让自己消失
You know how to disappear.

175
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,150
可我们要教你真正的隐形
We can teach you to become truly invisible.

176
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,480
隐形
Invisible?

177
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:44,120
忍者都懂得  隐形术需要的是耐心和灵敏
The ninja understands that invisibility is a matter of patience and agility.

178
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,800
时刻眼观六路  耳听八方
Always mind your surroundings.

179
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,180
在忍术中会用到炸药
Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.

180
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,690
作为武器
As weapons?

181
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,940
或是障眼法
Or distractions.

182
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,440
戏剧性和障眼法都是有力的武器
Theatricality and deception are powerful agents.

183
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,940
必须让你的对手觉得  你不只是一个凡人
You must become more than just a man in the mind of your opponent.

184
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,410
他是谁
Who is he?

185
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,410
曾是个农民
He was a farmer.

186
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,780
后来为了抢夺邻居的田地  成了一个杀人犯
Then he tried to take his neighbor's land and became a murderer.

187
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,250
现在他是阶下囚
Now he is a prisoner.

188
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,250
他会有什么下场
What'll happen to him?

189
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,830
受惩罚  不能容忍犯罪
Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated.

190
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,960
罪犯因为社会的谅解而越发变得肆无忌惮
Criminals thrive on the indulgence of society's understanding.

191
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,840
你父母的死不是你的错
Your parents' death was not your fault.

192
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,430
是你父亲的错
It was your father's.

193
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:11,160
愤怒改变不了你父亲没有反抗这个事实
Anger does not change the fact that your father failed to act.

194
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,350
那劫匪有枪
The man had a gun.

195
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,550
那会阻止你吗
Would that stop you?

196
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,540
我受过训练
I've had training.

197
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,540
训练不是重点
The training is nothing!

198
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,380
意志才重要
Will is everything!

199
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,010
抗争的意志
The will to act.

200
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,020
认输吧
Yield.

201
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,730
你还没打败我
You haven't beaten me.

202
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,610
为了砍人  你把有利的位置给放弃了
You have sacrificed sure footing for a killing stroke.

203
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,040
摩擦胸口
Rub your chest.

204
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,420
你的胳膊自然会暖和起来
Your arms will take care of themselves.

205
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,710
你比你的父亲坚强
You are stronger than your father.

206
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,010
你不认识我父亲
You didn't know my father.

207
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,470
可我知道愤怒是你的动力
But I know the rage that drives you.

208
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,930
那种不可思议的愤怒  纠缠着悲痛
That impossible anger strangling the grief...

209
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,760
直到对所爱之人的记忆  慢慢的
until the memory of your loved one is just...

210
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,930
侵蚀着你的血管
poison in your veins.

211
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,560
然后突然有一天 你会希望你爱的人根本没有存在过
And one day, you catch yourself wishing the person you loved had never existed

212
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,440
这样你才不会感到悲痛
so you'd be spared your pain.

213
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,820
我并不是一直住在这山里
I wasn't always here in the mountains.

214
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,490
我有过妻子
Once, I had a wife.

215
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,370
是我的至爱
My great love.

216
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,670
可她被夺去了生命
She was taken from me.

217
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:40,040
跟你一样  我最终认识到  对于那些无法无天的恶人
Like you, I was forced to learn there are those without decency

218
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,510
必须打击  毫不犹豫  绝不手软
who must be fought without hesitation, without pity.

219
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,630
愤怒给了你巨大的力量
Your anger gives you great power.

220
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,680
可一旦过头  也会毁了你
But if you let it, it will destroy you...

221
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,140
我就差点被毁了
as it almost did me.

222
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,020
什么平息了愤怒
What stopped it?

223
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,020
复仇
Vengeance.

224
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,150
这对我没用
That's no help to me.

225
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,150
为什么  布鲁斯
Why, Bruce?

226
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,980
为什么不替你的父母报仇
Why could you not avenge your parents?

227
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,280
听证会以后  你是直接回普林斯顿呢 少爷
Will you be heading back to Princeton after the hearing, sir...

228
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:14,120
还是听我的劝  在这儿多待一两天
or can I persuade you to stay on for a day or two?

229
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:16,500
我不会回去了
I'm not heading back at all.

230
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,750
你不喜欢那儿
You don't like it there?

231
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,750
我挺喜欢那儿
I like it fine.

232
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,920
只是校方不喜欢我
They just don't feel the same way.

233
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,380
我把主卧室收拾好了
I've prepared the master bedroom.

234
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,380
不用
No.

235
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,970
我那间就行了
My room will be fine.

236
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,680
别怪我多嘴  韦恩庄园是你的家
With all due respect, sir, Wayne Manor is your house.

237
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,680
不  阿尔弗雷德  是我父亲的家
No, Alfred, it's my father's house.

238
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,190
你父亲死了  韦恩少爷
Your father is dead.

239
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,190
这地方像坟墓
This place is a mausoleum.

240
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:38,440
要是照我的意思  我宁愿把它一砖一瓦的全部拆掉
If I have my way, I'll pull the damn thing down brick by brick.

241
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,690
这房子  韦恩少爷  曾经住过你们家族六代人
This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered six generations of your family.

242
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,570
你干嘛那么在乎  阿尔弗雷德  又不是你家
Why do you give a damn, Alfred? It's not your family.

243
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,280
我在乎  是因为有个好人托付我照顾...
I give a damn because a good man once made me responsible

244
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:55,540
一个他在这个世界上最疼爱的人
for what was most precious to him in the whole world.

245
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,040
道斯小姐会开车送你去听证会
Miss Dawes has offered to drive you to the hearing.

246
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,250
她也许会劝你不要去
She probably hopes to talk you out of going.

247
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,880
我应该把过去的事连同我父母一起埋葬吗  阿尔弗雷德
Should I just bury the past out there with my parents, Alfred?

248
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:10,130
我可不敢指点你该怎么处理过去的事情
I wouldn't presume to tell you what to do with your past, sir.

249
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:14,350
可你得知道  我们大家都在关心着  你要怎样度过自己的将来
Just know that there are those of us who care about what you do with your future.

250
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,220
还没对我失去信心吗
Haven't given up on me yet?

251
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,390
从来没有
Never.

252
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,360
阿尔弗雷德还是把炼乳藏在架子的顶层
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk on the top shelf.

253
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,160
他难道还没发现  你已经够得着了吗
Hasn't he noticed you're tall enough to reach now?

254
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,620
我猜是老习惯改不了了吧
Old habits die hard, I guess.

255
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,580
- 他以前也没难倒我们  - 是啊
- Never used to stop us anyway.  - No, it didn't.

256
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,620
你妈妈好吗
How's your mom?

257
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,290
她挺想念这儿
She misses this place.

258
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,290
我也是
So do I.

259
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,960
是的
Yeah.

260
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:31,130
可这儿物是人非  再也不是以前的样子了
But it's nothing without the people who made it what it was.

261
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,300
只剩阿尔弗雷德了
Now there's only Alfred.

262
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,300
还有你
And you.

263
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,720
我不会留下  瑞切尔
I'm not staying, Rachel.

264
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,020
你只是回来参加听证会
You're just back for the hearing.

265
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,810
布鲁斯  我想谁也没办法阻止你去听证会了
Bruce, I don't suppose there's any way to convince you not to come.

266
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:49,650
总得有人  在这听证会上
Someone at this proceeding

267
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,490
代表我的父母
should stand for my parents.

268
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,780
我们都爱你父母  布鲁斯
We all loved your parents, Bruce.

269
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,160
齐尔的罪行不可饶恕
What Chill did is unforgivable.

270
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,160
那你的上司干嘛要放了他
Then why is your boss letting him go?

271
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,790
在狱中  他跟卡曼・法科尼关一个牢房
In prison, he shared a cell with Carmine Falcone.

272
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:06,630
他知道了一些事  愿意出庭作证来换取提前假释
He learned things, and he will testify in exchange for early parole.

273
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:09,460
瑞切尔  这个人杀了我父母
Rachel, this man killed my parents.

274
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,170
我没法忘了这事
I cannot let that pass.

275
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,220
我需要你理解我  好吗
And I need you to understand that, please.

276
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,180
好吧
Okay.

277
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,600
大萧条对齐尔这样的劳动工人打击最大
The depression hit working people, like Mr. Chill, hardest of all.

278
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:26,980
他的罪行的确令人发指  可犯罪动机不是贪婪
His crime was appalling, yes, but it was motivated not by greed

279
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,980
而是走投无路
but by desperation.

280
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:33,070
鉴于他已服刑14年  而且与本检察院积极配合
Given the 14 years served, as well as his extraordinary level of cooperation...

281
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,860
在一件重大案件的调查中表现优异
with one of this office's most important investigations

282
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:39,160
我们强烈支持他提前假释的申请
we strongly endorse his petition for early release.

283
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,450
齐尔先生
Mr. Chill?

284
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,710
法官大人
Your Honor

285
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,710
我没有一天不为自己的所作所为感到悔恨
not a day goes by that I don't wish I could take back what I did.

286
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:57,000
我的确是走投无路  就像那时的很多人一样
Sure, I was desperate, like a lot of people back then

287
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,100
但这并不能改变我的罪行
but that don't change what I did.

288
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,400
今天出席听证会的  有一位韦恩家族的成员
I gather there is a member of the Wayne family here today.

289
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,860
他有什么话要说吗
Has he got anything to say?

290
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,920
他从侧门出来了
He's coming out the side!

291
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,620
他从侧门出来了  各位
He's coming out the side, guys!

292
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,380
布鲁斯・韦恩
Bruce Wayne!

293
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,430
乔  嗨  乔
Joe! Hey, Joe!

294
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,100
法科尼问候你
Falcone says hi.

295
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,810
走吧  布鲁斯
Come on, Bruce.

296
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,530
我们还是别看了
We don't need to see this.

297
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,320
我要看
I do.

298
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,360
地方检察官也不明白为什么斐顿法官
The DA couldn't understand why Judge Faden

299
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,460
执意坚持召开公开听证会
insisted on making the hearing public.

300
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,040
法科尼收买了法官  好让齐尔有机会被杀
Falcone paid him off to get Chill out in the open.

301
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,500
也许我该感谢他们
Maybe I should thank them.

302
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,760
你不是认真的
You don't mean that.

303
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,260
如果我是当真的呢
What if I do, Rachel?

304
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,340
该为我父母伸张正义
My parents deserved justice.

305
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:22,430
你说的并不是正义  你说的是复仇
You're not talking about justice. You're talking about revenge.

306
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,600
有时候  两者一样
Sometimes, they're the same.

307
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,480
它们不一样  布鲁斯
No, they're never the same.

308
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,230
正义是为了维持社会和谐  复仇只是逞一时之快
Justice is about harmony. Revenge is about you making yourself feel better.

309
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,190
所以需要公正的司法制度
It's why we have an impartial system.

310
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,690
你们的制度出毛病了
Your system is broken.

311
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:43,020
你很在乎正义吗  那么别老想着你自己的痛苦
You care about justice? Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.

312
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,490
这城市在堕落
This city is rotting.

313
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,450
他们都以为大萧条是过去的事  其实不是
They talk about the depression as if it's history. It's not.

314
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,120
现在的情况比过去更糟
Things are worse than ever here.

315
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,830
法科尼让大街充斥着毒品和犯罪
Falcone floods our streets with crime and drugs

316
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,960
大发不义之财  以至于每天都有齐尔这样的罪犯诞生
preying on the desperate, creating new Joe Chills every day.

317
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,670
虽然法科尼没有亲手杀死你父母  布鲁斯
Falcone may not have killed your parents, Bruce...

318
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,800
但他摧毁了你父母代表的一切
but he's destroying everything that they stood for.

319
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,520
你想为此感谢他吗  那就去吧
You wanna thank him for that? Here you go.

320
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,140
要找到他并不难  但只要他继续维护坏人的利益
We all know where to find him. As long as he keeps the bad people rich

321
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,400
让好人感到恐惧  就没人能动得了他
and the good people scared, no one'll touch him.

322
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,860
像你父母那样敢于对抗不公的人  已经消失了
Good people like your parents, who'll stand against injustice, they're gone.

323
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:23,740
当好人都撒手不管的时候  这城市还有什么希望
What chance does Gotham have when the good people do nothing?

324
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,030
我不是你说的好人  瑞切尔
I'm not one of your good people, Rachel.

325
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,030
你什么意思
What do you mean?

326
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:33,330
这么多年来  我一直想杀他
All these years, I wanted to kill him.

327
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,710
现在没机会了
Now I can't.

328
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,310
你真让你父亲丢脸
Your father would be ashamed of you.

329
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:39,270
你比小报上看起来要高  韦恩先生
You're taller than you look in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.

330
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,610
没带枪  我好没面子
No gun? I'm insulted.

331
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:48,570
你只要给我送封感谢信就可以了   我不是来谢你的
You could've just sent a thank-you note. I didn't come here to thank you.

332
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,490
我是来告诉你  这个城市里并非人人都怕你
I came to show you that not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you.

333
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,290
只有认识我的人才怕我  小子
Only those who know me, kid.

334
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,120
四下看看吧  这儿有两个议员
Look around you. You'll see two councilmen

335
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,290
一个工会头头  两个下班警察
a union official, couple off-duty cops

336
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,340
还有一个法官
and a judge.

337
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,800
现在我能毫不犹豫地打爆你脑袋  就在这儿  在他们眼前  
I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of blowing your head off in front of them.

338
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,680
这种权力是用钱买不到的
Now, that's power you can't buy.

339
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,760
这是恐惧的力量
That's the power of fear.

340
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,430
我不怕你
I'm not afraid of you.

341
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,520
因为你觉得自己已经毫无牵挂
Because you think you got nothing to lose.

342
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,350
但你没有完全想清楚
But you haven't thought it through.

343
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,600
你没想过你那在检察院工作的女朋友
You haven't thought about your lady friend in the DA's office.

344
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:22,190
你没想过你那年迈的管家
You haven't thought about your old butler.

345
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,660
像你这样的人
People from your world

346
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,200
有太多的牵挂
have so much to lose.

347
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:35,700
现在  你认为因为你老爸老妈被人打死了
Now, you think because your mommy and your daddy got shot

348
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,830
你就了解生活的残酷了  可你不了解
you know about the ugly side of life, but you don't.

349
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,130
你没尝过绝望的滋味
You've never tasted desperate.

350
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,840
你是  是布鲁斯・韦恩  哥谭市的王子
You're You're Bruce Wayne, the prince of Gotham.

351
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,700
你得走上一千里  才能找到一个不认识你的人
You'd have to go 1000 miles to meet someone who didn't know your name.

352
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:51,890
所以你别  别怒气冲冲跑到这儿来试图向自己证明什么
So don't come here with your anger, trying to prove something to yourself.

353
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,180
这个世界你永远没法理解
This is a world you'll never understand.

354
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,350
你总会害怕那些
And you always fear

355
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,980
你不理解的东西
what you don't understand.

356
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,230
行了
All right.

357
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,700
是的  你有种  小鬼  这我承认
Yeah, you got spirit, kid. I'll give you that.

358
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,870
比你家老子有种
More than your old man anyway.

359
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:20,330
在牢里  齐尔跟我说了他那晚是怎么杀你父母的
In the joint, Chill told me about the night he killed your parents.

360
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,710
他说你老爸哀求他饶命
He said your father begged for mercy.

361
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,840
哀求
Begged.

362
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,380
就像条狗
Like a dog.

363
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,020
你应该多给点小费
Should've tipped better.

364
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,870
- 这是干嘛  - 买你的外套
- For what?  - Your jacket.

365
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,030
好吧
Okay.

366
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,200
嗨  嗨  嗨
Hey, hey, hey.

367
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,580
送给我吧  多好的衣服呀
Let me have it. It's a nice coat.

368
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,870
你穿上之后可得小心了
Be careful who sees you with that.

369
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,000
他们会来找我的
They're gonna come looking for me.

370
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,550
- 谁  - 所有人
- Who?  - Everyone.

371
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,590
这
It's

372
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,760
这真是件好衣服
It's a nice coat.

373
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:36,450
当你与罪犯同行的时候  你是不是同情他们
When you lived among the criminals, did you start to pity them?

374
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:40,290
当我第一次为了不被饿死而偷窃的时候 是的
The first time I stole so that I wouldn 't starve, yes.

375
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:45,960
我失去了许多判断对与错的基本能力
I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong.

376
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,340
后来我到处流浪
And when I traveled

377
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,220
我体会到了那种在罪恶面前的恐惧感
I learned the fear before a crime

378
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:55,550
以及实施犯罪后的快感
and the thrill of success.

379
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,310
但是我从未变成他们中的一员
But I never became one of them.

380
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,780
蠢货  我才不管你叫什么名字呢
Fool. What do I care what your name is?

381
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,690
你就是一个罪犯
You're a criminal.

382
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,940
那你去跟这些货物的主人说吧
Tell that to the guy who owned these.

383
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,990
你环游世界  为的是了解罪犯的心理
You've traveled the world to understand the criminal mind

384
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,110
战胜自身的恐惧
and conquer your fears.

385
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,330
可是罪犯并没有那么复杂
But a criminal is not complicated.

386
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,830
你真正的恐惧来自你的内心
And what you really fear is inside yourself.

387
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,540
你害怕自己的力量
You fear your own power.

388
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,000
你害怕愤怒
You fear your anger

389
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:34,720
害怕驱使你行善或者做恶的动力
the drive to do great or terrible things.

390
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,350
现在你得环游你的内心
Now you must journey inwards.

391
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,180
准备好了
You are ready.

392
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,240
吸气
Breathe.

393
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,240
深深地吸
Breathe.

394
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,870
吸入你的恐惧
Breathe in your fears.

395
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,540
面对它们
Face them.

396
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,840
要战胜恐惧  你必须成为恐惧本身
To conquer fear, you must become fear.

397
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,380
你必须沉浸在别人的恐惧中
You must bask in the fear of other men.

398
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,260
人最害怕的是看不见东西
And men fear most what they cannot see.

399
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:41,370
你必须成为别人的恐惧之源
You have to become a terrible thought.

400
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,120
成为幽魂
A wraith.

401
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,210
你必须成为一种意念
You have to become an idea!

402
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,140
感受恐惧模糊你的感官
Feel terror cloud your senses.

403
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:10,100
感受恐惧扭曲你的身心
Feel its power to distort.

404
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,270
控制你的一切
To control.

405
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,000
并且明白  这力量也可以被你拥有
And know that this power can be yours.

406
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:35,380
拥抱最狰狞的恐惧
Embrace your worst fear.

407
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:44,680
与黑暗融为一体
Become one with the darkness.

408
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:08,660
全神贯注  集中思想
Focus. Concentrate.

409
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,960
驾驭你的感官
Master your senses.

410
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:41,490
你不能留下任何痕迹
You cannot leave any sign.

411
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,070
我没有
I haven't.

412
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:53,370
精彩之极
Impressive.

413
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,550
你的恐惧已被清除了
We have purged your fear.

414
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,350
你能够带领这些人吗
You are ready to lead these men.

415
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:11,060
你能够成为影武者联盟的成员了
You are ready to become a member of the League of Shadows.

416
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:17,860
但首先  你必须显示维护正义的意愿
But first, you must demonstrate your commitment to justice.

417
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,960
不
No.

418
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,710
我不是刽子手
I'm no executioner.

419
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:42,920
你的同情心  是你的敌人绝不会有的
Your compassion is a weakness your enemies will not share.

420
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,590
所以它尤为重要
That's why it's so important.

421
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,590
它使我们有别于敌人
It separates us from them.

422
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,140
你不是想打击罪犯吗  他是个杀人犯
You want to fight criminals. This man is a murderer.

423
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,100
- 他应该受审 - 谁来审
- This man should be tried.  - By whom?

424
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,980
那些腐败官僚
Corrupt bureaucrats?

425
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,650
罪犯无视社会的法律
Criminals mock society's laws.

426
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:59,110
这你有切身体会
You know this better than most.

427
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,610
你还无法带领这些人
You cannot lead these men...

428
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:06,780
除非你已经准备去做击败邪恶所必须做的事
unless you are prepared to do what is necessary to defeat evil.

429
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,780
那我要带这些人去哪儿
And where would I be leading these men?

430
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:11,620
哥谭
Gotham.

431
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:13,830
你作为哥谭的宠儿
As Gotham's favored son...

432
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,330
将是最理想的人选直捣那犯罪的中心
you will be ideally placed to strike at the heart of criminality.

433
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,770
怎么做
How?

434
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,470
哥谭的大限已经到了
Gotham's time has come.

435
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:25,970
就像君士坦丁堡和古罗马那样
Like Constantinople or Rome before it

436
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:30,350
这城市已经成为苦难和不公的滋生地
the city has become a breeding ground for suffering and injustice.

437
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:34,140
它已经无法拯救了  必须灭亡
It is beyond saving and must be allowed to die.

438
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:39,480
这就是我们影武者联盟最为重要的任务和职责
This is the most important function of the League of Shadows.

439
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:42,860
我们履行了几百年的职责
It is one we've performed for centuries.

440
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,940
哥谭
Gotham

441
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,990
必须被彻底摧毁
must be destroyed.

442
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,830
你不会相信这些吧
You can't believe in this.

443
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:57,580
拉斯・阿・古救过我们  使我们逃离心灵最阴暗的角落
Ra's al Ghul rescued us from the darkest corners of our own hearts.

444
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:02,170
他所要的回报  就是勇气  去做我们该做之事
What he asks in return is the courage to do what is necessary.

445
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,710
我会回哥谭去  我会打击这样的罪犯
I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men like this

446
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,470
但我不会做刽子手
but I will not become an executioner.

447
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,180
布鲁斯  听着
Bruce, please.

448
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:13,180
为了你自己  你已经没有退路了
For your own sake, there is no turning back.

449
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,240
你在干什么
What are you doing?

450
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,050
做我该做之事  我的朋友
What's necessary, my friend.

451
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,650
我会告诉他  是你救了他的命
I will tell him you saved his life.

452
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:28,920
韦恩少爷  你走了好一阵了
Master Wayne, you've been gone a long time.

453
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,090
的确是
Yes, I have.

454
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,390
你看起来很时髦
You look very fashionable.

455
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,380
除了满身泥
Apart from the mud.

456
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:37,300
这次回哥谭会待很久吗  先生
Are you coming back to Gotham for long, sir?

457
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:38,720
需要待多久就待多久
As long as it takes.

458
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:40,390
我要向哥谭的市民证明
I want to show the people of Gotham...

459
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:43,970
哥谭市不属于那些罪犯和贪官
their city doesn't belong to the criminals and the corrupt.

460
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:47,350
在经济大萧条时期  你父亲几乎用尽韦恩企业的所有资产
In the depression, your father nearly bankrupted Wayne Enterprises...

461
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,730
来消除贫穷
combating poverty.

462
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:53,440
他深信  他的表率能激励哥谭的富豪拯救这城市
He believed his example could inspire the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.

463
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:55,360
成功了吗
Did it?

464
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:57,950
算是吧
In a way.

465
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:01,200
他惨遭谋杀  为有钱有势的人敲响警钟
Their murder shocked the wealthy and the powerful into action.

466
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,250
人们的漠不关心  唯有戏剧性大逆转才能唤醒
People need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy.

467
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:08,080
以布鲁斯・韦恩的身份没法干这事
I can't do that as Bruce Wayne.

468
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,790
作为凡人
As a man

469
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,380
作为血肉之躯就可能被忽视  被击败
I'm flesh and blood, I can be ignored, destroyed.

470
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,460
但是成为正义化身
But as a symbol

471
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,590
成为正义化身  我就能坚不可摧
As a symbol, I can be incorruptible.

472
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,390
我就能永恒
I can be everlasting.

473
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,390
什么化身
What symbol?

474
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:24,640
一种人人皆知
Something elemental...

475
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,430
又令人恐惧的东西
something terrifying.

476
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,730
我想  在你打击恶势力的时候
I assume that as you take on the underworld...

477
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:34,020
这化身  同样也可以保护你关爱的人免遭恶人报复
this symbol is a persona to protect those you care about from reprisals?

478
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,570
你在担心瑞切尔吗
You're thinking about Rachel?

479
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:38,110
说实话  我在担心我自己
Actually, sir, I was thinking of myself.

480
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,870
你告诉过别人我要回来了吗
Have you told anyone I'm coming back?

481
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:46,290
我不知道  让你起死回生在法律上会有什么后果
I couldn't figure the legal ramifications of bringing you back from the dead.

482
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,460
死
Dead?

483
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,460
你失踪七年了
You've been gone seven years.

484
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,790
你让人宣布我死亡
You had me declared dead?

485
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,830
厄尔先生一手包办的  他还让公司上市
Actually, it was Mr. Earle. He's taking the company public.

486
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,250
他还想卖掉你的大部分股份呢
He wanted to liquidate your majority shareholding.

487
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,800
那些股份  可值一大笔钱
Those shares are worth quite a bit of money.

488
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,680
好吧  还好我把所有财产都留给你保管了 
Well, it's a good thing I left everything to you, then.

489
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,840
是该庆幸
Quite so, sir.

490
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:06,770
你可以借用那辆劳斯莱斯  回来的时候加满油就行
And you can borrow the Rolls, if you like. Just bring it back with a full tank.

491
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:21,450
在我看来  萨兹先生无论对自己和别人都是一个危险
In my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much a danger to himself as to others...

492
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:26,410
对他的康复而言  监狱也许不是最佳场所
and prison is probably not the best environment for his rehabilitation.

493
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,290
- 克瑞恩医生  - 道斯小姐
- Dr. Crane.  - Miss Dawes.

494
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,750
你真的认为一个黑社会的杀手不需要进监狱吗
You think a man who butchers people for the mob doesn't belong in jail?

495
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,590
我的精神评估不是说着玩的 道斯小姐
I would hardly have testified to that otherwise, would I?

496
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:40,840
法科尼的手下  这已经是第三个被你诊断为疯子
This is the third of Falcone's thugs you've had declared insane

497
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:42,430
并且改送疯人院了
and moved into your asylum.

498
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:47,260
看来  黑社会的工作一定很吸引那些疯子
The work offered by organized crime must have an attraction to the insane.

499
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:50,810
或是贪官
Or the corrupt.

500
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,650
芬奇先生
Mr. Finch.

501
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,770
我想你该跟道斯小姐核实一下
You should check with Miss Dawes here

502
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:01,320
你的检察院是否已经授权她指控我了  有这样的指控吗
just what implications your office has authorized her to make. If any.

503
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:06,510
你干嘛  瑞切尔
What are you doing?

504
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,710
我还想问你呢  卡尔
What are you doing, Carl?

505
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,160
我是为你好
Looking out for you.

506
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:14,580
这城里一半的人都被法科尼收买了
Falcone has half the city bought and paid for.

507
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,880
打住吧
Drop it.

508
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:16,880
你怎么能这么说
How can you say that?

509
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,670
因为  虽然我很希望能够捉拿法科尼  但我更在乎你
Because as much as I care about getting Falcone, I care more about you.

510
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,130
你真好
That's sweet.

511
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:29,930
但我们已经结束了
We've been through all that.

512
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,460
又是讨厌的蝙蝠
Blessed bat again, sir.

513
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,340
它们肯定是在庄园里筑巢了
They nest somewhere in the grounds.

514
00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:00,920
别再找我帮忙  有人起疑心了
No more favors. Someone is sniffing around.

515
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:04,040
嗨  说好了你我相互帮忙的  医生
Hey, I scratch your back, you scratch mine, doc.

516
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:05,590
我帮你把货运进来
I'm bringing in the shipments.

517
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:07,510
我们是付你钱的
We are paying you for that.

518
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:10,180
也许付钱不如帮我个忙来得实在
Maybe money isn't as interesting to me as favors.

519
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:17,470
我很清楚  我本人对你没有任何威慑  法科尼先生
I am more than aware that you are not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.

520
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,730
可你知道我为谁做事  等他来这儿
But you know who I'm working for, and when he gets here

521
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:22,810
他  他要来哥谭
He He's coming to Gotham?

522
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,440
对  没错
Yes, he is.

523
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:27,070
等他来的时候  他可不愿意听到
And when he gets here, he's not going to wanna hear

524
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:32,320
你为了不让你手下坐牢而威胁到我们的行动
that you've endangered our operation just to get your thugs out of jail time.

525
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:34,450
谁在找麻烦
Who's bothering you?

526
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:36,150
一个姑娘  检察院的
There's a girl at the DA's office.

527
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,950
- 我们收买她  - 收买不了
- We'll buy her off. - Not this one.

528
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:42,050
理想主义者  是吧
Idealist, huh?

529
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:43,880
好吧  总有办法把她解决
Well, there's an answer to that too.

530
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:46,260
这跟我无关
I don't want to know.

531
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:47,260
大有关系
Yes, you do.

532
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:54,850
不  我们在这几个部门的业务发展态势良好
No, we are showing very healthy growth in these sectors.

533
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:58,180
我想托马斯・韦恩不会把制造重型武器
I don't think Thomas Wayne would have viewed heavy-arms manufacture

534
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:00,520
视为公司的核心业务
as a suitable cornerstone for our business.

535
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:05,690
那是20年之前  弗雷德里克斯
Well, that's 20 years ago, Fredericks.

536
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:09,190
我想经过20年  我们完全可以
I think after 20 years we can allow ourselves

537
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,200
不去考虑托马斯・韦恩要是活着会怎么做
to stop thinking about what Thomas Wayne would have done.

538
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,240
早上好  厄尔先生办公室
Good morning, Mr. Earle's office.

539
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:17,700
是的  他确定会出席明天的晚餐
Yes, he's confirmed for the dinner tomorrow evening.

540
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:21,200
早上好  我来见厄尔先生
Good morning. I'm here to see Mr. Earle.

541
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:22,870
姓名
Name?

542
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:25,000
布鲁斯・韦恩
Bruce Wayne.

543
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,380
托马斯要是活着  也许不会让公司上市
Thomas would probably not have taken the company public.

544
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:34,630
可作为负责公司运作的经营者  我们就会这么做
But that is what we, as responsible managers, are going to do.

545
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:36,890
杰西卡
Jessica?

546
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:40,520
杰西卡  你在哪儿
Jessica? Where are you?

547
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:42,020
眼睛看着球  现在挥
Eye on the ball, and...

548
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,020
为什么没人接电话
Why is no one answering the phone?

549
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,770
这是韦恩企业  厄尔先生  他们一定会再打来
It's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle. I'm sure they'll call back.

550
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:51,610
布鲁斯  你不是死了吗
Bruce? You're supposed to be dead.

551
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,740
抱歉让你失望了
I'm sorry to disappoint.

552
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:55,360
我要你看看这个
I need you to take a look at this.

553
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,660
你是不是见过他了
Have you seen him yet?

554
00:48:56,910 --> 00:48:58,450
- 谁  - 韦恩
- Who?  - Wayne.

555
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,870
成热点新闻了  他回来了
It's been all over the news. He's back.

556
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:07,710
我想你一定能理解  我没法让它停下
I'm sure you realize I can't stop the big machine.

557
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,130
诸多环节已经启动
Too many wheels turning.

558
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:10,340
我们就要上市了
We're going public.

559
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,340
这我理解
I understand.

560
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,590
我的股份也能让我得到丰厚的回报
And I'll be handsomely rewarded for my shares.

561
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,300
我不是来找麻烦的
I'm not looking to interfere.

562
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,890
- 我是来找工作  - 哦
- I am looking for a job.  - Oh?

563
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:23,100
我想了解一下我家族创办的公司
I just want to get to know the company that my family built.

564
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:25,190
你想从哪个部门做起
Any ideas where you would start?

565
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:28,060
应用科学部  我挺感兴趣
Applied Sciences caught my eye.

566
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,150
福克斯管的
Fox's department.

567
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,320
我会告诉他你要来
I'll let him know you're coming.

568
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,990
你真像他  像你父亲
You look like him. Your dad.

569
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:39,450
你是韦恩家族仅剩的最后一人了
You're the only one left of the Wayne family.

570
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:43,580
这儿就是你的家  欢迎回来
This is where you belong. Welcome home.

全是实验原型  没有投入量产的
All prototypes. None in production.

573
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,460
完全没有  什么都没有
On any level whatsoever. None?

574
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:57,300
他们说这地方是干嘛的
What did they tell you this place was?

575
00:49:57,470 --> 00:49:59,510
什么都没跟我说
They didn't tell me anything.

576
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:05,430
厄尔把我安排到这里的时候  倒是说得清清楚楚
Earle told me exactly what it was when he sent me down here.

577
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:07,350
死胡同
Dead end.

578
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,860
为的是不让我给董事会继续添麻烦
Place to keep me from causing the board any more trouble.

579
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,320
来吧
Come on.

580
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:14,730
你是董事会的
You were on the board?

581
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:16,030
你父亲管事那会儿
When your father ran things.

582
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:17,990
- 你认识我父亲  - 是啊
- You knew my father?  - Oh, yeah.

583
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,820
火车就是我帮他造的
Helped him build his train.

584
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:22,030
到了
Here we are.

585
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,330

你父亲的火车很了不起
Wonderful project, your dad's train.

589
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:42,800
直接通进了韦恩大厦  连同供水和供电线路
Routed it right into Wayne Tower, along with the water and power utilities.

590
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:46,180
就像把韦恩大厦变成了哥谭的中心
Kind of made Wayne Tower the unofficial center of Gotham City.

591
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:49,020
当然  被厄尔荒废了  瞧这儿
Of course, Earle let it go to rot. Here we are.

592
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,020

- Tear-resistant? -  This sucker will stop a knife.

595
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:01,150
- 防弹吗  - 一般的子弹都能防
- Bulletproof?  - Anything but a straight shot.

596
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:02,780
那么为什么他们不投产呢
Why didn't they put it into production?

597
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:06,660
那些管账的认为士兵的一条烂命不值30万
Bean counters didn't think a soldier's life was worth 300 grand.

598
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:11,210
那么  你为什么感兴趣  韦恩先生
So, what's your interest in it, Mr. Wayne?

599
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,380
我想借用
I want to borrow it.

600
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,340
用来洞穴探险
For spelunking.

601
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:17,510
洞穴探险
Spelunking?

602
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:19,380
是的  下到山洞里探险
Yeah, you know, cave diving?

603
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:23,350
难道在洞穴里还会有人向你开枪吗
You expecting to run into much gunfire in these caves?

604
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,100
听着  我不希望厄尔先生知道我借用了
Look, I'd rather Mr. Earle didn't know about me borrowing

605
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,350
韦恩先生
Mr. Wayne

606
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,480
在我看来
the way I see it

607
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:35,400
这里的东西都是你的
all this stuff is yours anyway.

608
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,860
好了  我们试试
Okay. Give it a try.

609
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:46,240
美极了
Charming.

610
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,870
至少你有伴了
At least you'll have company.

611
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:56,750
我想这儿一定是东南角最低的地基了
This must be the lowest foundation of the southeast wing.

612
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:13,400
内战期间  你的曾曾祖父参加了地下交通网
Your great-great-grandfather was involved in the Underground Railroad

613
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,570
秘密的运送逃亡奴隶到北方  
secretly transporting freed slaves to the North

614
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:20,440
所以我猜  这些洞当时很管用
and I suspect these caverns came in handy.

615
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,290
阿尔弗雷德  到这儿来
Alfred! Come up here!

616
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,460
在这儿我已经看得很清楚了  多谢了  少爷
I can see everything all right from down here, sir, thank you.

617
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,150
头罩的组件我们从新加坡订购
We order the main part of this cowl from Singapore.

618
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,820
通过一家皮包公司
Via a dummy corporation.

619
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:04,820
没错  然后我们从另一家
Indeed. And then, quite separately

620
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:09,950
亚洲公司单独订购一套蝙蝠耳
we place an order to a Chinese company for these.

621
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:12,460
然后自己组装
Put it together ourselves.

622
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:13,460
正是
Precisely.

623
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:17,670
不过  必须是大批量订购  以免引起怀疑
They'll have to be large orders, to avoid suspicion.

624
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:18,880
多大量
How large?

625
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,380
大概1万左右
Say 10,000.

626
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,800
好吧  至少我们有替换的了
Well, at least we'll have spares.

627
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,800
就是
Yes.

628
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,990
你要不要分一点呢
Don't suppose you want a taste.

629
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:48,320
我以后还会问  没准哪天你也就开窍了
I just keep offering, thinking maybe someday you'll get wise.

630
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:50,660
你别自以为聪明  弗拉斯
There's nothing wise in what you do, Flass.

631
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:54,200
吉姆  你老这么不收  搞得弟兄们很紧张
Well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste, makes us guys nervous.

632
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:56,210
我不会告发
I'm no rat.

633
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,670
全城都这么腐败  想告发也没处告啊
In a town this bent, who's there to rat to anyway?

634
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:34,490
别回头
Don't turn around.

635
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,170
你这样的好警察  所剩无几了
You're a good cop. One of the few.

636
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:39,960
你想干嘛
What do you want?

637
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:43,300
卡曼・法科尼每星期都运毒品来
Carmine Falcone brings in shipments of drugs every week.

638
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:45,260
却没人抓他  为什么
Nobody takes him down. Why?

639
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:48,800
他把当局相关人员都收买了
He's paid up with the right people.

640
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:51,890
怎么做才能让他栽跟头
What will it take to bring him down?

641
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,020
向斐顿法官施压
Leverage on Judge Faden

642
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,100
得有个够胆量的检察官起诉他
and a DA brave enough to prosecute.

643
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,150
瑞切尔・道斯
Rachel Dawes.

644
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:01,860
你是谁
Who are you?

645
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:03,900
注意我的标记
Watch for my sign.

646
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:08,610
你就一个人
You're just one man?

647
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:10,450
现在是两个
Now we're two.

648
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,160
我们
We?

649
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,550
不许动
Freeze!

650
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,650
那是什么鬼东西
What the hell was that?

651
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:54,780
只是一个疯子
Just some nut.

652
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,000
今天玩什么花样  还要洞穴探险吗
Well, what is it today? More spelunking?

653
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,670
不  今天是低空跳
No. Today it's BASE-jumping.

654
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,880
低空跳
BASE-jumping.

655
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:08,010
就像跳伞一样吗
That like parachuting?

656
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:09,010
差不多
Kind of.

657
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:13,010
你有没有轻一些的布料
Do you have any lightweight fabrics?

658
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:15,850
巧了  刚好有合适的
You know, I think I have just the thing.

659
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:19,640
这叫记忆布  看出什么了吗
It's called memory cloth. Notice anything?

660
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,860
平时很柔韧
Regularly flexible

661
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:27,400
但当电流通过的时候
but put a current through it

662
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:31,070
分子就重新排列  变得很坚硬
molecules realign, it becomes rigid.

663
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:32,570
你能把它做成什么形状
What kind of shapes can you make?

664
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:35,870
可以根据不同的骨架  做成什么形状都行
Can be tailored to fit any structure based on a rigid skeleton.

665
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:37,240
对军队来说太贵了吗
Too expensive for the Army?

666
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:42,160
他们大概没想到可以卖给喜欢低空跳的亿万富翁
I don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, BASE-jumping crowd.

667
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:44,120
- 听着 福克斯先生  - 说吧
- Look, Mr. Fox.  - Yes, sir?

668
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:46,170
你要是觉得不乐意
If you're uncomfortable

669
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:49,550
韦恩先生  要是你不想告诉我你在干什么
Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing

670
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:51,670
别人问起来我就不用撒谎
when I'm asked, I don't have to lie.

671
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:56,010
不过你别把我当傻瓜
But don't think of me as an idiot.

672
00:56:57,510 --> 00:56:59,470
说得有理
Fair enough.

673
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:03,230
那是什么
What's that?

674
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:07,230
那辆弹力车吗
The Tumbler?

675
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:09,690
哦  这你不会感兴趣的
Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.

676
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,620
它原本是用来架桥的
She was built as a bridging vehicle.

677
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:24,040
打仗的时候  用两辆这样的车就能拉起缆绳过河了
During combat, two of these would jump over a river, towing cables.

678
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:30,210
就在这节流阀上面  把它打开然后加速  燃气启动
Over here on the throttle, flip that open and throttle up.

679
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,960
这车无需坡道就能跳跃  现在别
This will boost you into a rampless jump Not now!

680
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,930
停  现在停  先生
Not Not now, sir.

681
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,640
燃气装置关闭
Afterburner disengaged.

682
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:46,060
我们的桥总是无法正常使用
We never could get the damn bridge to work

683
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:47,940
不过这车倒是没问题
but this baby works just fine.

684
00:57:57,490 --> 00:57:58,740
那么  觉得怎么样
So, what do you think?

685
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:01,990
这车有黑色的吗
Does it come in black?

686
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:05,000
我需要你星期四到码头来
I need you at the docks Thursday.

687
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:06,250
有问题吗
Problems?

688
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,250
我不希望最后一批货出问题
I don't want any trouble with the last shipment.

689
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:09,320
没问题
Sure.

690
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,670
有一个传闻  检察院那里有人在找你的麻烦
Word on the street is you got a beef with somebody in the DA's office.

691
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:15,860
是吗
Is that right?

692
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,260
而且你愿出重金
And that there's a fat prize...

693
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:20,140
用来奖励那些能解决这件事情的人
waiting for anybody willing to do anything about it.

694
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:22,260
有话就直说 弗拉斯先生
So, what's your point, Mr. Flass?

695
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,970
你见过那女孩吗
Have you seen the girl?

696
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:27,140
是个迷人的助理检察官
It's a cute little assistant D A.

697
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:30,980
你不觉得把她干掉  有点太引人注意了吗
Don 't you think that's a little too much heat to bring down, maybe?

698
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:32,480
就算在哥谭
Even for this town.

699
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,480
你可别低估了哥谭市
Never underestimate Gotham City.

700
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:37,490
下班回家时遭打劫  这种事天天都会发生
People get mugged coming home from work every day of the week.

701
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:40,280
有时候  有时候  晦气来了没法挡
Sometimes, Sometimes things just go bad.

702
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,950
看来是石墨还不够  少爷
It's a problem with the graphite, sir.

703
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,830
下一批的1万个应该符合标准了
The next 10,000 will be up to specifications.

704
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,590
幸好这一批打了折
At least they gave us a discount.

705
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:51,590
是啊
Quite.

706
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:53,380
顺便提个醒  少爷
In the meantime, sir,

707
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:57,380
我建议你降落时候  别脑袋着地
may I suggest you try to avoid landing on your head?

708
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,420
你为什么要选蝙蝠
Why bats, Master Wayne?

709
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:37,920
蝙蝠让我恐惧
Bats frighten me.

710
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:41,510
是时候让敌人感到一样的恐惧了
It's time my enemies shared my dread.

711
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,120
这是什么
What is this?

712
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,250
接着搬
Continue.

713
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,430
看来一切顺利
Looks fine out there.

714
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,760
那些熊宝宝直接给贩子
The bears go straight to the dealers.

715
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:27,600
对  兔宝宝直接给纳罗斯的客户
Yeah, and the rabbits go to the man in the Narrows.

716
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:28,770
有什么区别
What's the difference?

717
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:30,770
无知是福  我的朋友
Ignorance is bliss, my friend.

718
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:34,100
那些恶人的秘密  你还是不知道最省心
Don't burden yourself with the secrets of scary people.

719
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:52,960
嗨  史戴斯
Hey. Steiss.

720
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:15,730
史戴斯
Steiss?

721
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:29,280
怎么了
What?

722
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,500
搞什么鬼
What the?

723
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,340
我去看看
I better check it.

724
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:56,900
这里出事了  你最好赶紧撤
There's a problem out here. You better bail.

725
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:27,840
你在哪儿
Where are you?!

726
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:29,050
这儿
Here.

727
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:53,410
开车  见鬼
Get going. Oh, shit.

728
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,720
你到底是什么鬼东西
What the hell are you?

729
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:17,930
蝙蝠侠
I'm Batman.

730
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,240
衣服真帅
Nice coat.

731
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:31,490
谢谢
Thanks.

732
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:13,780
别动
Hold it.

733
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:18,370
这就对了  逃命吧
That's right, you better run.

734
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:29,170
法科尼派他们杀你
Falcone sent them to kill you.

735
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:31,380
为什么
Why?

736
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:32,880
因为你对着干
You rattled his cage.

737
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:38,220
- 这是什么  - 把柄
- What's this?  - Leverage.

738
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:40,020
- 用来干嘛  - 让他合作
- For what? - To get things moving.

739
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:42,000
你是谁
Who are you?

740
01:04:42,690 --> 01:04:43,940
跟你一样的
Someone like you.

741
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:46,150
一个喜欢对着干的人
Someone who'll rattle the cages.

742
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:54,740
女士  你没事吧
Ma'am? Everything okay?

743
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,540
法科尼的人
Falcone's men?

744
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:01,540
那又怎样
Does it matter?

745
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:04,000
我们又找不到证据抓他
We'll never tie him to it anyway.

746
01:05:04,210 --> 01:05:06,340
我看那未必是事实
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

747
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:21,220
那是什么东西
What the hell is that?

748
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:32,070
把他放下来
Cut him down.

749
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:55,930
岂有此理
Unacceptable.

750
01:05:56,090 --> 01:05:58,930
我才不管他们是敌对帮派  守护天使
Now, I don't care if it's rival gangs, Guardian Angels...

751
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:01,060
还是什么该死的救世军
or the goddamn Salvation Army

752
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:03,640
别再让他们上大街  也别再上头版
get them off the street and off the front page.

753
01:06:03,810 --> 01:06:06,400
他们说只有一个人  或者说生物
They say it was just one guy. Or a creature.

754
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:09,270
或者说穿上戏装的混球
It was some asshole in a costume.

755
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:10,740
干什么
Yeah?

756
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:14,400
可他为我们抓住了  城里最大的犯罪分子
This guy did deliver us one of the city's biggest crime lords.

757
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:18,070
这城市归我管  没人可以擅自执法
No one takes the law into their own hands in my city.

758
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,450
懂了吗
Understand?

759
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:20,740
这次他逃不掉了
No way to bury it now.

760
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:22,240
也许吧  可还得对付斐顿法官呢
Maybe so. There's still Judge Faden.

761
01:06:22,370 --> 01:06:23,460
斐顿法官我能搞定
I've got Faden covered.

762
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:25,460
那么人们都在议论的蝙蝠怎么办
What about this bat they babble about?

763
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:28,750
就算喽罗们作证说  打他们的是一只大蝙蝠
Even if these guys will swear to being thrashed by a giant bat

764
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:31,090
可法科尼是在现场抓到的
we've got Falcone at the scene.

765
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:34,460
毒品  指纹  货物舱单  这大蝙蝠什么都给我们了
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests. This bat character gave us everything.

766
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,430
好吧  那就干吧
Okay. Let's do it.

767
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:40,870
蝙蝠白天是睡觉
Bats are nocturnal.

768
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:41,970
话是这么说
Bats may be.

769
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:45,560
可富家公子睡到下午3点  也太离谱了吧
But even for billionaire playboys, 3:00 is pushing it.

770
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,480
恐怕是双重生活的代价
The price for leading a double life, I fear.

771
01:06:50,810 --> 01:06:53,230
你的好戏引起轰动了
Your theatrics made an impression.

772
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:57,650
戏剧效果和障眼法
Theatricality and deception

773
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:01,030
有时候是有利的武器  我开了一个好头
are powerful weapons, Alfred. This is a good start.

774
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,990
要是以后  你经常这么受伤的话
If those are to be the first of many injuries to come

775
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,000
那我建议你  编个合适的原因
it would be wise to find a suitable excuse.

776
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:08,670
比如打马球什么的
Polo, for instance.

777
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:10,500
我才不学马球呢  阿尔弗雷德
I'm not learning polo, Alfred.

778
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:14,420
老是受伤  又不见你有社交生活
Strange injuries, a nonexistent social life.

779
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:16,050
人们一定会有疑问
These things beg the question

780
01:07:16,210 --> 01:07:20,470
布鲁斯・韦恩到底是怎么打发他的时间和金钱的
as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne do with his time and his money.

781
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,220
我这样的人通常都干什么
What does someone like me do?

782
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:27,390
开开跑车  泡泡电影明星
Drive sports cars, date movie stars.

783
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:29,650
能买什么就买什么
Buy things that are not for sale.

784
01:07:29,810 --> 01:07:33,360
谁知道  韦恩少爷   没准一开始假装
Who knows, Master Wayne, you start pretending to have fun

785
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:35,980
到后来还真会乐此不疲呢
you might even have a little by accident.

786
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:40,160
先生
Sir.

787
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:42,660
我们出状况了  说下去
We have a situation. All right.

788
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:46,870
海岸警卫队昨天晚上发现我们的一艘货船
The Coast Guard picked up one of our cargo ships last night

789
01:07:47,410 --> 01:07:52,210
船损毁严重  船员失踪  可能都死了
heavily damaged, all crew missing, probably dead.

790
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:56,630
船上装有一件测试阶段的武器
The ship was carrying a prototype weapon.

791
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,630
是微波发射器
It's a microwave emitter.

792
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:01,760
是专为沙漠战设计的  可是
It's designed for desert warfare, but it...

793
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:05,010
可是好像有人
It looks like somebody

794
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:10,890
把它启动了
turned it on.

795
01:08:15,070 --> 01:08:19,530
这发射器利用聚焦微波  来蒸发敌人的水供应
It uses focused microwaves to vaporize the enemy's water supply.

796
01:08:27,450 --> 01:08:30,410
对船的破坏是毁灭性的
The damage to the ship was catastrophic.

797
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:33,580
至于这武器嘛  它已经
The weapon itself, is...

798
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,380
失踪了
Missing?

799
01:08:37,210 --> 01:08:38,460
对
Yeah.

800
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,720
韦恩先生
Mr. Wayne.

801
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:46,890
这车真牛
Nice car.

802
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:48,430
我的另一辆车更牛
You should see my other one.

803
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,400
他做到了警察从未做到的事
He's done something the police never have.

804
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:02,860
谁都不能擅自执法
You can't take the law into your own hands.

805
01:09:03,030 --> 01:09:05,620
好吧  至少他做了件好事
Well, at least he's getting something done.

806
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:08,120
布鲁斯  帮我说说话
Bruce, help me out here.

807
01:09:08,290 --> 01:09:12,620
哦  把自己装扮成蝙蝠的人很显然脑子有病
Well, a guy who dresses up like a bat clearly has issues.

808
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:15,920
可他把法科尼送进了大牢
But he's put Falcone behind bars.

809
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,460
可现在警察要抓他  这说明什么呢
And now the cops want him. What does that tell you?

810
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:19,840
说明警察妒忌了
They're jealous.

811
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:22,630
先生  那水池是装饰用的
Sir, the pool is for decoration

812
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:26,000
您那两位朋友连泳衣都没有穿
and your friends do not have swimwear.

813
01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:29,970
哦  她们是欧洲人
Well, they're European.

814
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:34,190
看来我只能请你离开了
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

815
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:37,370
这不是钱的问题
It is not a question of money.

816
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:38,570
好吧  是这样的
Well, you see...

817
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:40,940
我要买下这酒店
I'm buying this hotel

818
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:47,160
然后定些新规矩  给水池增点色
and setting some new rules about the pool area.

819
01:09:48,330 --> 01:09:50,700
我想应该给蝙蝠侠授予勋章
I think the Batman deserves a medal.

820
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:53,000
然后挂在他的囚服上
And a straitjacket to pin it on.

821
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,090
谢谢
Thank you.

822
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:04,170
布鲁斯
Bruce?

823
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,550
瑞切尔
Rachel?

824
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,140
我听说你回来了
I'd heard you were back.

825
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:14,690
你在干什么
What are you doing?

826
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:16,860
在这儿游泳呢
Just swimming here.

827
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:19,860
哦  我们有好久没见了
Wow, it is good to see you.

828
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:21,570
你走了好长一段时间
You were gone a long time.

829
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:24,070
我知道  你怎么样
I know. How are things?

830
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:25,070
老样子
The same.

831
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:28,660
工作越来越难
Job's getting worse.

832
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:31,540
靠你一个人改变不了世界
Can't change the world on your own.

833
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:33,790
我有什么办法呢
What choice do I have

834
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:36,210
你却只是忙着游泳
when you're too busy swimming?

835
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:39,580
瑞切尔  这些
Rachel, all of

836
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:41,550
这一切
All this

837
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:47,010
这  这不是  我
It's It's not me. It's

838
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:50,050
在内心  我其实
Inside, I am

839
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:53,220
更丰富
I am more.

840
01:10:53,890 --> 01:10:55,430
来吧  布鲁斯  快来啊
Come on, Bruce. Come on.

841
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:59,400
布鲁斯  我们还等你再买几家酒店呢
Bruce, we have some more hotels for you to buy.

842
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:01,900
布鲁斯
Bruce

843
01:11:03,070 --> 01:11:06,570
在你内心  你也许还是从前那个真诚的男孩
deep down you may still be that same great kid you used to be.

844
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:11,580
可关键不是看内心
But it's not who you are underneath

845
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:13,790
而是看你的所作所为
it's what you do that defines you.

846
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:27,920
克瑞恩医生  谢谢你能来
Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.

847
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:30,970
不用客气  法科尼割腕了吗
Not at all. He cut his wrists?

848
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:34,810
也许是想装疯逃避坐牢吧  可万一真出事了
Probably looking for the insanity plea. But if anything should happen

849
01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:37,930
是啊  还是谨慎些为妙
Of course, better safe than sorry.

850
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:44,940
是啊  克瑞恩医生  我再也受不了了  这太难受了
Yeah, Dr. Crane, I can't take it anymore. It's all too much.

851
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:47,570
整天被墙围着  难受  难受  难受
The walls are closing in. Blah, blah, blah.

852
01:11:48,110 --> 01:11:50,610
再吃两天这猪食  我真要疯了
A couple of days of this food, it'll be true.

853
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:53,280
- 想怎么样  - 我想知道
- What do you want?  - I wanna know...

854
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:55,950
你怎么劝服我把我的嘴给闭上
how you're gonna convince me to keep my mouth shut.

855
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:58,290
闭嘴干嘛  你什么都不知道
About what? You don't know anything.

856
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:02,630
我知道  你不希望警察仔细查验那些毒品
I know you don't want the cops to take a closer look at the drugs they seized.

857
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:06,960
我还知道  你在疯人院用精神病人做人体实验
And I know about your experiments with the inmates of your nut house.

858
01:12:07,130 --> 01:12:10,800
明白了吧  我只和那些已经被我摸清了底细的人做交易
See, I don't go into business with a guy without finding out his dirty secrets.

859
01:12:11,390 --> 01:12:14,300
还有  你用的那些人
And those goons you used.

860
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:16,310
全城的打手都是我的
I own the muscle in this town.

861
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:19,850
现在  我已经帮你运了几个月的货
Now, I've been bringing your stuff in for months

862
01:12:20,390 --> 01:12:24,610
所以  你主子的计划一定很大  我要分成
so whatever he's planning, it's big, and I want in.

863
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:29,030
好吧  那他一定会这么说
Well, I already know what he'll say.

864
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:30,820
我们应该杀了你
That we should kill you.

865
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:35,990
我在牢里他杀不了  是我的地盘
Even he can't get me in here. Not in my town.

866
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,500
想看看我的面具吗
Would you like to see my mask?

867
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,500
做试验时我才用
I use it in my experiments.

868
01:12:49,010 --> 01:12:53,470
也许  它的恐怖程度  吓不倒你这样的人
Now, I'm probably not very frightening to a guy like you.

869
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:56,680
可那些疯子  却受不了
But these crazies, they can't stand it.

870
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,560
从几时起  疯子开始管疯人院了
So when did the nut take over the nut house?

871
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:03,190
他们尖叫  他们哭喊
They scream and they cry

872
01:13:04,190 --> 01:13:05,810
就像你现在这样
much as you're doing now.

873
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:11,360
哦  他没在装  这会儿没有
Well, he's not faking. Not that one.

874
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:14,070
我会找法官谈谈  看看能不能把他转移到
I'll talk to the judge and see if I can get him moved

875
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:17,660
阿卡姆疯人院的安全区域 在这里我没法治疗他
to the secure wing at Arkham. I can't treat him here.

876
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:41,180
暴风雨要来了
Storm's coming.

877
01:13:45,770 --> 01:13:48,770
你整垮法科尼之后  警察败类开始坐立不安了
The scum is getting jumpy because you stood up to Falcone.

878
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:52,490
才开始呢  你的搭档当时跟法科尼一起在码头
It's a start. Your partner was at the docks with Falcone.

879
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:55,360
好吧  他晚上有时兼职给人做打手
Well, he moonlights as a low-level enforcer.

880
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:59,530
他们把那批货一分为二  只有一半到贩子手里
They were splitting the shipment in two. Only half went to the dealers.

881
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:01,620
为什么  那另一半呢
Why? What about the other half?

882
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,500
弗拉斯知道
Flass knows.

883
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:04,500
他不会说的
He won't talk.

884
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:06,710
他会跟我说
He'll talk to me.

885
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:09,920
洛布局长专门调集了大批的警力来抓捕你
Commissioner Loeb set up a massive task force to catch you.

886
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:11,920
他认为你是危险分子
He thinks you're dangerous.

887
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:12,920
你怎么认为
What do you think?

888
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:17,090
我认为你想帮忙
I think you're trying to help.

889
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:24,430
不过我之前也看错过人
But I've been wrong before.

890
01:14:30,230 --> 01:14:31,940
快点  我不能老等着
Come on, I ain't got all night.

891
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,110
弗拉斯  我孩子得吃饭
Flass, I have kids to feed.

892
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:39,740
怎么  他们不爱吃你的煎饼吗
What, they don't like falafel?

893
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:56,840
另一批毒品送到哪儿了
Where were the other drugs going?

894
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:00,300
我不知道  不知道
I never knew. I don't know.

895
01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:01,680
我对天发誓
I swear to God.

896
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:02,680
对我发誓
Swear to me!

897
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:11,320
我  我真的不知道  真的不知道
I don't I don't know. I never knew. Never.

898
01:15:11,610 --> 01:15:15,070
要在某个人那儿放两天  然后才发货给贩子
They went to some guy for a couple days before they went to the dealers.

899
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:16,530
为什么
Why?

900
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:20,780
还有别的  别的东西在毒品里
There was something Something else in the drugs

901
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:22,530
- 在那儿藏着  - 什么
- something hidden. - What?

902
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:26,040
我没去过交货地  只知道在纳罗斯岛
I never went to the drop-off point. It was in the Narrows.

903
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,100
警察也是在人多的时候才敢去
Cops only go there in force.

904
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:29,500
你看我像警察吗
Do I look like a cop?

905
01:15:29,670 --> 01:15:30,660
不
No

906
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:46,500
我说的就是这个
This is the one I'm talking about.

907
01:15:47,390 --> 01:15:48,390
有什么问题吗
What's your problem with it?

908
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:49,690
不该有这项
It shouldn't exist.

909
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:53,690
离开新加坡时是246项  到了码头却多了一项
This ship left Singapore with 246 containers, but arrived with 247.

910
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:56,230
我猜这里面一定有不该出现的东西
I'm guessing there's something I'm not supposed to find in there.

911
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,820
听着  检察官  我们从不过问法科尼装什么货
Listen, counselor, we don't wanna know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.

912
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:03,330
现在情况不一样了 把它打开
Things are working a little differently now. Open it up.

913
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,170
什么鬼东西
What the hell is this?

914
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:59,920
那个人就是你吧  大家都在议论你
It's you, isn't it? Everybody's been talking about you.

915
01:17:00,510 --> 01:17:02,260
快给我进来
Get in here!

916
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,010
伙伴们不会相信我
The other kids won't believe me.

917
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:30,250
把痕迹都销毁
Get rid of all traces.

918
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:32,060
不如放火全烧了
Better torch the whole place.

919
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:33,460
好主意
All right.

920
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:11,290
有问题吗
Having trouble?

921
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,330
那就坐下  喝一杯
Take a seat. Have a drink.

922
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:18,290
你像是一个太把自己当回事的人
You look like a man who takes himself too seriously.

923
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:25,010
想听听我的意见吗  可别太上火了
Do you want my opinion? You need to lighten up.

924
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:20,690
阿尔弗雷德  阿尔弗雷德
Alfred, Alfred.

925
01:19:30,570 --> 01:19:33,950
血液  验血  我中毒了  血里有毒
Blood. Take. Take poison. Blood poison.

926
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:37,120
有毒  有毒
Poisonous. Poisonous.

927
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:43,130
布鲁斯
Bruce

928
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:45,590
我们为什么摔跤
why do we fall?

929
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,520
我昏迷了多久
How long was I out?

930
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,020
两天
Two days.

931
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,230
今天你生日
It's your birthday.

932
01:20:04,570 --> 01:20:05,820
祝你长命百岁
Many happy returns.

933
01:20:11,030 --> 01:20:14,830
我以前有过这感觉  但这次要强烈得多
I've felt these effects before, but this was so much more potent.

934
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:19,580
像是某种致幻剂  被做成了喷雾式的武器
It was some kind of hallucinogen, weaponized, in aerosol form.

935
01:20:19,790 --> 01:20:22,710
你真是去了不该去的地方啊  韦恩先生
You have been hanging out in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.

936
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:26,000
第二天你的情况恶化后  我就请了福克斯先生
I called Mr. Fox when your condition worsened after the first day.

937
01:20:26,170 --> 01:20:27,550
我给你验了血
I analyzed your blood

938
01:20:27,710 --> 01:20:31,180
分离了受体合成物  以及蛋白催化剂
isolating the receptor compounds and the protein-based catalyst.

939
01:20:31,390 --> 01:20:33,180
难到我需要明白这些吗
Am I meant to understand any of that?

940
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:36,680
没关系  我只想让你知道那有多难
Not at all. I just wanted you to know how hard it was.

941
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:39,980
说到底  我合成了一种解药
Bottom line, I synthesized an antidote.

942
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:40,980
你能多做一些吗
Could you make more?

943
01:20:41,190 --> 01:20:43,730
你打算再中一次毒吗  韦恩先生
You planning on gassing yourself again, Mr. Wayne?

944
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:47,110
这些你懂  福克斯先生  晚上在外面混  想爽一把
Well, you know how it is. You're out at night, looking for kicks...

945
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:50,070
没准还会有人滴上这种致幻剂
someone's passing around the weaponized hallucinogens

946
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:53,660
我有的都拿来  解药应该能让你暂时免疫了
I'll bring what I have. The antidote should inoculate you for now.

947
01:20:53,870 --> 01:20:56,200
阿尔弗雷德  见到你很高兴
Alfred, always a pleasure.

948
01:20:56,410 --> 01:20:58,040
幸会
Lucius.

949
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:05,250
- 你真的不想进来  - 我得回去了
- You sure you don't want to come in?  - I have to get back.

950
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:07,130
- 请您把这交给他  - 谢谢
- I wanted to leave this. Thank you.

951
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:08,370
瑞切尔
Rachel?

952
01:21:10,050 --> 01:21:13,220
看来  有人体力透支得很厉害啊
Looks like someone's been burning the candle at both ends.

953
01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:15,100
一定是大场面吧
Must've been quite an occasion.

954
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:16,100
今天我生日
It is my birthday.

955
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:19,930
我知道  抱歉  今晚我来不了了  我来给你送礼物
I know. I'm sorry I can't come tonight. I was just dropping off your present.

956
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:21,560
你有更好的安排吗
You've got better plans?

957
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:23,560
我的上司已经失踪两天了
My boss has been missing for days

958
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:25,610
这就是说  也许我得开始
which means I should probably start...

959
01:21:25,610 --> 01:21:27,440
去河里打捞他的尸体了
by looking at the bottom of the river.

960
01:21:27,650 --> 01:21:29,110
瑞切尔  对不起
Rachel. Excuse me.

961
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:33,240
瑞切尔・道斯
Rachel Dawes.

962
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:37,450
是谁批准的  叫克瑞恩马上去检察院  非去不可
Who authorized that? Get Crane down there now. Don't take no for an answer.

963
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:41,500
通知里蒙医生  告诉他明早我们需要把评估报告交给法官
Call Dr. Lehmann, tell him we need our own assessment to the judge by morning.

964
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:43,750
- 出什么事了  - 是法科尼
What's wrong? It's Falcone.

965
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:46,420
克瑞恩医生把法科尼从监狱转到疯人院去了
Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum on suicide watch.

966
01:21:46,630 --> 01:21:49,630
你要去疯人院吗  那可是在纳罗斯  瑞切尔
You're going to Arkham now? It's in the Narrows, Rachel.

967
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,670
享受你的派对吧  布鲁斯
You enjoy your party, Bruce.

968
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,640
我还得去工作呢
Some of us have work to do.

969
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:55,640
你小心点
You be careful.

970
01:21:57,390 --> 01:21:58,930
生日快乐
Happy birthday.

971
01:22:18,370 --> 01:22:20,450
可是  少爷  客人们马上就要来了
But, Master Wayne, the guests will be arriving.

972
01:22:20,660 --> 01:22:22,290
我回来之前好好招待他们
Keep them happy until I arrive.

973
01:22:22,450 --> 01:22:24,620
说你常说的那些笑话
Tell them that joke you know.

974
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,210
玩得开心吗
Having fun?

975
01:23:07,330 --> 01:23:10,880
比尔  你这样的大人物来这种地方干什么
Bill? Now, what's a big shot like you doing in a place like this?

976
01:23:11,090 --> 01:23:12,340
我得查些资料
I need some information.

977
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:17,300
韦恩企业  47-B  1-ME
The Wayne Enterprise 47-B, 1 -ME.

978
01:23:18,590 --> 01:23:19,500
1-ME
1-ME.

979
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:24,020
那是微波发射器  设计它是用来蒸发敌人的水供应
It's a microwave emitter. It was designed to vaporize an enemy's water supply.

980
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:28,440
传言说  他们曾在空气中散布水性化学试剂做试验
Rumor was they tested dispersing water-based chemicals into the air

981
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:30,520
可那不是违法的吗
but isn't that illegal?

982
01:23:32,270 --> 01:23:36,490
我要所有相关资料  有关该项目的研发
I want all the information on the development of this project

983
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:40,660
所有数据  档案  备份盘片  立刻给我送过来
all data, files, backup disks, on my desk right away.

984
01:23:41,070 --> 01:23:42,700
你弄丢了一台吗
Did you lose one?

985
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:47,370
我要把你的部门跟档案室合并
I'm merging your department with Archives.

986
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:49,880
你被解雇了
And I am firing you.

987
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:54,000
你没有接到通知吗
Didn't you get the memo?

988
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:02,890
稻草人
Scarecrow.

989
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:08,060
稻草人
Scarecrow.

990
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:12,730
稻草人
Scarecrow.

991
01:24:15,780 --> 01:24:17,940
道斯小姐  你可是这儿的稀客
Miss Dawes, this is most irregular.

992
01:24:18,150 --> 01:24:21,070
给法官的报告  我没有什么补充啊
I have nothing to add to the report I filed with the judge.

993
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:22,450
我对你的报告有疑问
I have questions about your report.

994
01:24:22,450 --> 01:24:23,450
请说
Such as?

995
01:24:23,660 --> 01:24:27,950
这也太巧了吧  一个52岁没有精神病史的人
Isn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man who has no history of mental illness...

996
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:31,710
突然之间精神完全崩溃了  而且刚好就在他被起诉之前
to have a psychotic breakdown just when he's about to be indicted?

997
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:36,130
就像你亲眼看到的  他目前的症状已经相当的严重
As you can see for yourself, there is nothing convenient about his symptoms.

998
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,180
- 稻草人  - 什么稻草人
- Scarecrow.  - What's "scarecrow"?

999
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:46,260
处于妄想阶段的精神病人  经常会把焦点集中于
Patients suffering delusional episodes often focus their paranoia...

1000
01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:48,560
一个外部的施虐者
on an external tormentor

1001
01:24:48,770 --> 01:24:51,940
通常类似于荣格的原始意向
usually one conforming to Jungian archetypes.

1002
01:24:52,190 --> 01:24:54,560
在这一病例中  是稻草人
In this case, a scarecrow.

1003
01:24:56,070 --> 01:24:57,200
用过药了
He's drugged?

1004
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:00,200
精神病药理学是我的专业
Psychopharmacology is my primary field.

1005
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:01,740
我提倡药物的使用
I'm a strong advocate.

1006
01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:04,830
在外面  他有权有势
Outside, he was a giant.

1007
01:25:05,030 --> 01:25:07,450
而在这全儿  只有精神能给你权力
In here, only the mind can grant you power.

1008
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:09,370
这让你很过瘾
You enjoy the reversal.

1009
01:25:09,580 --> 01:25:12,580
我认为精神的力量胜过肉体
I respect the mind's power over the body.

1010
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:14,290
所以我才干这行
It's why I do what I do.

1011
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:19,340
我干这行是为了把他这样的恶霸送进监狱  而不是疯人院
I do what I do to keep thugs like Falcone behind bars, not in therapy.

1012
01:25:19,550 --> 01:25:22,800
我要检察院的精神病学顾问对法科尼进行全面检查
I want my own psychiatric consultant to have full access to Falcone

1013
01:25:23,010 --> 01:25:26,350
包括给他验血  看你究竟给他用了什么
including blood work. Find out what exactly you put him on.

1014
01:25:26,510 --> 01:25:27,970
那明天一早吧
First thing tomorrow, then.

1015
01:25:27,970 --> 01:25:28,970
今晚
Tonight.

1016
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:32,100
我已经呼过县总医院的里蒙医生了
I've already paged Dr. Lehmann at County General.

1017
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:35,810
悉听尊便
As you wish.

1018
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:43,320
请这边走
This way, please.

1019
01:25:43,490 --> 01:25:46,070
有些东西我觉得你该看看
There's something I think you should see.

1020
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,590
这就是我们制造药物的地方
This is where we make the medicine.

1021
01:26:06,430 --> 01:26:10,310
也许你也该来一点  清醒清醒
Perhaps you should have some, clear your head.

1022
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:37,210
谁知道你在这儿
Who knows you're here?

1023
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:39,880
谁知道
Who knows?

1024
01:26:47,090 --> 01:26:48,300
他来了
He's here.

1025
01:26:48,510 --> 01:26:49,720
谁
Who?

1026
01:26:49,930 --> 01:26:51,890
蝙蝠侠
The Batman.

1027
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:54,680
我们怎么办
What do we do?

1028
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:55,680
我们遇到贼了
What anyone does...

1029
01:26:55,770 --> 01:26:58,520
我们还能怎么办
when a prowler comes around.

1030
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:00,490
报警呗
Call the police.

1031
01:27:00,490 --> 01:27:02,030
你要把警察叫来
You want the cops here?

1032
01:27:02,610 --> 01:27:05,360
这会儿他们阻止不了我们
At this point, they can't stop us.

1033
01:27:05,570 --> 01:27:09,070
不过蝙蝠侠  搞破坏倒很在行
But the Batman has a talent for disruption.

1034
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:12,450
把他逼出去  警察会干掉他  走
Force him outside, the police will take him down. Go.

1035
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:13,750
那这女的呢
What about her?

1036
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:14,750
她没多久了
She hasn't got long.

1037
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,920
我给了她超浓剂量
I gave her a concentrated dose.

1038
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:19,630
这是承受的极限  快走吧
The mind can only take so much. Now go.

1039
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:24,420
那些关于他的传闻
The things they say about him.

1040
01:27:24,630 --> 01:27:26,170
他真的能飞吗
Can he really fly?

1041
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:28,390
我听说他会隐形
I heard he can disappear.

1042
01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:31,600
就会知道了
Well, we'll find out.

1043
01:27:31,890 --> 01:27:33,520
是不是
Won't we?

1044
01:28:20,850 --> 01:28:22,980
尝尝你自己的药  医生
Taste of your own medicine, doctor?

1045
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:31,490
你在这儿干些什么
What have you been doing here?

1046
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:37,000
你为谁做事
Who are you working for?

1047
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:43,790
拉斯 拉斯・阿・古
Ra's Ra's al Ghul.

1048
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:48,840
拉斯・阿・古死了 你为谁做事
Ra's al Ghul is dead. Who are you working for?

1049
01:28:49,050 --> 01:28:50,050
克瑞恩
Crane.

1050
01:28:52,550 --> 01:28:55,470
克瑞恩医生现在不在
Dr. Crane isn't here right now.

1051
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:57,930
但如果你想预约的话
But if you'd like to make an appointment

1052
01:29:10,990 --> 01:29:13,910
蝙蝠侠  放下武器  就地投降
Batman, put down your weapons and surrender.

1053
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:15,990
你被包围了
You're surrounded.

1054
01:29:21,580 --> 01:29:23,000
你们还在等什么
What are you waiting for?

1055
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,330
等增援
Backup.

1056
01:29:25,090 --> 01:29:26,160
增援
Backup?

1057
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,460
蝙蝠侠在里面
The Batman's in there.

1058
01:29:27,670 --> 01:29:29,800
特警马上到  可如果你要进去
SWAT's on the way. But if you wanna go in now...

1059
01:29:30,010 --> 01:29:31,550
那我跟在你后面
I'll be right behind you, sir.

1060
01:29:33,050 --> 01:29:34,590
特警马上到
SWAT's on the way.

1061
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:36,930
嗨  嗨
Hey. Hey.

1062
01:30:19,470 --> 01:30:21,180
她这是怎么了
What's happened to her?

1063
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:27,610
克瑞恩给她用了精神致幻剂  是一种引起恐慌症的毒素
Crane poisoned her with a psychotropic hallucinogen, a panic-inducing toxin.

1064
01:30:29,650 --> 01:30:31,000
让我送她到医院去
Let me get her down to the medics.

1065
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,360
医生帮不了她  可我能
They can't help her, but I can.

1066
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:39,450
抱她下楼  在纳罗斯小巷碰头
Get her downstairs. Meet me in the alley.

1067
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:50,300
克瑞恩把毒药藏在法科尼的毒品中偷运进来
Crane's been smuggling his toxin hidden in Falcone's drugs...

1068
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:52,630
然后他们把药倒进了供水系统里
and they're dumping it into the water supply.

1069
01:30:53,170 --> 01:30:54,800
- 天呐 他有什么阴谋  - 不知道
- What was he planning?  - I don't know.

1070
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:56,340
他为法科尼做事吗
Was he working for Falcone?

1071
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:59,350
他说是另一个人  那人更坏
He mentioned someone else, someone worse.

1072
01:30:59,550 --> 01:31:02,100
得赶紧给她用解药  不然就不可逆转了
She needs the antidote before the damage is permanent.

1073
01:31:02,310 --> 01:31:03,480
她还能撑多久
How long does she have?

1074
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:04,480
没多久
Not long.

1075
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,190
什么声音
What is that?

1076
01:31:11,570 --> 01:31:12,520
增援
Backup.

1077
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:13,820
见鬼
What the?

1078
01:32:31,790 --> 01:32:33,330
打扰了
Excuse me.

1079
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:39,300
她怎么样了
How is she?

1080
01:32:39,300 --> 01:32:41,300
快不行了  得赶紧走
She's fading. We gotta go.

1081
01:32:43,170 --> 01:32:44,630
我去开车
I'll get my car.

1082
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,590
我有车
I brought mine.

1083
01:32:47,010 --> 01:32:48,640
你的车
Yours?

1084
01:32:57,980 --> 01:32:59,770
我也得去弄辆这样的
I've gotta get me one of those.

1085
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:02,220
他开车跑了
He is in a vehicle.

1086
01:33:02,230 --> 01:33:03,150
车型和颜色
Make and color?

1087
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,700
是辆黑色的
It's a black...

1088
01:33:07,030 --> 01:33:08,320
坦克
tank.

1089
01:33:10,990 --> 01:33:12,370
镇静
Stay calm.

1090
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:14,830
你被下毒了
You've been poisoned.

1091
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:18,840
我盯上他了
I'm on him.

1092
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:28,300
慢慢呼吸
Breathe slowly.

1093
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:39,520
坐稳
Hold on.

1094
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:55,410
- 你在干什么  - 抄近路
- What are you doing?  - Shortcut.

1095
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:05,720
呼叫地面  封锁斜坡
Air One to ground, block that ramp.

1096
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:11,890
他在房顶  逃不了了
He's got no way off that roof.

1097
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:16,350
关掉引擎  从车里出来
Turn off your engine. Step away from the car.

1098
01:34:18,730 --> 01:34:19,780
相信我
Trust me.

1099
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:21,480
武器系统启动
Weapons system activated.

1100
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:40,670
那家伙是谁
Who is this guy?

1101
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:41,880
他哪儿去了
Where's he going?

1102
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:42,710
他上房顶了
He's on the roof.

1103
01:34:57,140 --> 01:34:58,310
他在哪条街上
What street is he taking?

1104
01:34:58,310 --> 01:34:59,310
他不在街上
He's not on a street.

1105
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:01,230
他在房顶上到处飞
He's flying on rooftops.

1106
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:42,690
至少告诉我这车是什么样嘛
At least tell me what it looks like.

1107
01:35:45,730 --> 01:35:47,190
不用说了
Never mind.

1108
01:35:51,070 --> 01:35:52,450
盯上了
Got him.

1109
01:36:03,330 --> 01:36:04,880
我们就在他后面
Coming right up on his butt.

1110
01:36:29,610 --> 01:36:32,030
我们在I17大道追踪可疑车辆
We're tracking suspect vehicle heading west on l17.

1111
01:36:37,330 --> 01:36:39,040
- 空中一号呼叫地面 -  跟丢了
- Air One to ground.   - I lost him.

1112
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,040
我们失去目标  9号出口已封锁
We've lost visual. Exit 9 is blocked.

1113
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:43,210
我们绕到前面的路上去看看
We'll loop back to check the frontage road.

1114
01:36:43,410 --> 01:36:45,500
隐形模式启动
Stealth mode activated.

1115
01:36:46,170 --> 01:36:47,380
你得挺住
Stay with me.

1116
01:36:53,590 --> 01:36:55,050
什么  他在那儿
What? There he is.

1117
01:37:14,780 --> 01:37:16,240
千万挺住
Just hold on.

1118
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:21,370
瑞切尔
Rachel!

1119
01:37:54,150 --> 01:37:56,130
他们把这玩意儿灌进主管道了吗
They get any of this into the mains?

1120
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:56,700
是啊
Yeah.

1121
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:59,530
通知自来水公司  一定有办法隔离该地区的
Notify the water company. There's gotta be a way to isolate it.

1122
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:02,580
来不及  他们全投了  一定有几个星期了
No. They put it all in. They must've been at this for weeks.

1123
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:05,030
哥谭的整个供水系统都污染了
Gotham's entire water supply is laced.

1124
01:38:05,030 --> 01:38:06,330
可我们怎么还没起反应
Why haven't we felt the effects?

1125
01:38:06,540 --> 01:38:08,790
这种物质肯定是吸入肺里才有反应
Must be a compound that has to be absorbed through the lungs.

1126
01:38:19,050 --> 01:38:20,760
感觉怎么样
How do you feel?

1127
01:38:23,510 --> 01:38:24,970
这是哪儿
Where are we?

1128
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:26,770
为什么带我来这儿
Why did you bring me here?

1129
01:38:26,770 --> 01:38:29,270
不这么做  你早就精神错乱了
lf I hadn't, your mind would be lost.

1130
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:30,480
你中了毒
You were poisoned.

1131
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:33,280
是  是克瑞恩医生
It was. It was Dr. Crane.

1132
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:35,280
躺下  他在戈登手里
Rest. Gordon has Crane.

1133
01:38:35,490 --> 01:38:37,570
戈登队长是你朋友
Is Sergeant Gordon your friend?

1134
01:38:38,450 --> 01:38:40,070
我可不奢望有朋友
I don't have the luxury of friends.

1135
01:38:40,990 --> 01:38:44,330
我会给你打镇静剂  到家后你会醒来
I'm gonna give you a sedative. You'll wake up back at home.

1136
01:38:44,490 --> 01:38:48,410
醒来后  把这些给戈登  直接给他  别信其他人
When you do, get these to Gordon, and Gordon alone. Trust no one.

1137
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:50,330
- 这是什么  - 是解药
- What are they?  - The antidote.

1138
01:38:50,540 --> 01:38:53,840
一支给戈登自己用  另一支用来批量生产
One for Gordon to inoculate himself, the other for mass production.

1139
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:55,510
批量生产
Mass production?

1140
01:38:55,710 --> 01:38:58,840
克瑞恩只是小卒子  恶战在后面
Crane was just a pawn. We need to be ready.

1141
01:39:24,830 --> 01:39:28,200
当你告诉我  你拯救哥谭的大计划时候
When you told me your grand plan for saving Gotham

1142
01:39:28,410 --> 01:39:31,330
我之所以没有把心理医生叫来的唯一原因 
the only thing that stopped me from calling the men in white coats

1143
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:33,960
是因为你说  那么做不是为了寻求刺激
was when you said it wasn't about thrill-seeking.

1144
01:39:34,170 --> 01:39:35,170
的确不是
It's not.

1145
01:39:35,170 --> 01:39:37,170
那你管那叫什么
What would you call that?

1146
01:39:39,050 --> 01:39:40,220
超级火爆的电视
Damn good television.

1147
01:39:40,220 --> 01:39:41,720
没死人已经算奇迹了
It's a miracle no one was killed.

1148
01:39:41,930 --> 01:39:45,560
我没时间遵守交通规则  阿尔弗雷德
I didn't have time to observe the rules of the road, Alfred.

1149
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:48,850
我看是你扮演的怪物让你着了魔
You're getting lost inside this monster of yours.

1150
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:51,910
我扮成怪物是为了帮助别人
I'm using this monster to help other people,

1151
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:53,440
就像当年我父亲帮助别人那样
just like my father did.

1152
01:39:53,650 --> 01:39:55,190
托马斯・韦恩帮助别人
For Thomas Wayne, helping others

1153
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:58,320
不是为了证明什么给别人看  或给自己看
wasn't about proving anything to anyone, including himself.

1154
01:39:58,780 --> 01:40:02,110
我是为瑞切尔 阿尔弗雷德  她快死了
It's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying.

1155
01:40:02,570 --> 01:40:05,160
她在楼下  我给她用了镇静剂  你送她回家
She's downstairs, sedated. I need you to take her home.

1156
01:40:05,490 --> 01:40:09,080
我们都关心瑞切尔  可你所做的得高于这一切
Well, we both care for Rachel, but what you're doing has to be beyond that.

1157
01:40:09,410 --> 01:40:12,330
不能有私情  不然就成了义警
It can't be personal, or you're just a vigilante.

1158
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:14,330
- 福克斯还在吗  - 还在
- Is Fox still here?   - Yes, sir.

1159
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:16,170
我们得把客人们打发走
We need to send these people away.

1160
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:19,500
那些可是你布鲁斯・韦恩的客人  你得维护名声 少爷
Those are Bruce Wayne's guests. You have a name to maintain.

1161
01:40:19,510 --> 01:40:21,300
我不在乎我的名声
I don't care about my name.

1162
01:40:21,510 --> 01:40:24,680
不光是你的名声  还有你父亲的
It's not just your name, sir. It's your father's name.

1163
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:28,770
他只剩下这个了
And it's all that's left of him.

1164
01:40:30,730 --> 01:40:32,270
别毁了它
Don't destroy it.

1165
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:48,940
厄尔先生
Mr. Earle.

1166
01:40:48,940 --> 01:40:49,940
生日快乐  布鲁斯
Happy birthday, Bruce.

1167
01:40:50,150 --> 01:40:51,530
谢谢
Thank you.

1168
01:40:51,860 --> 01:40:53,860
股票情况怎么样
How did the stock offering go?

1169
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:55,320
一路飞涨
Prices soared.

1170
01:40:55,530 --> 01:40:56,740
谁在买进
Who was buying?

1171
01:40:56,950 --> 01:40:58,830
各种投资人和经纪人
All kinds of funds and brokerages.

1172
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:00,750
说来挺复杂
It's a bit technical.

1173
01:41:00,910 --> 01:41:02,620
最重要的是
The key thing is...

1174
01:41:02,790 --> 01:41:04,750
我们公司前途无量
our company's future is secure.

1175
01:41:06,630 --> 01:41:07,630
很好
Great.

1176
01:41:21,350 --> 01:41:23,640
她醉得连车都上不了了
A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid.

1177
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:31,190
计划是什么  克瑞恩
What was the plan, Crane?

1178
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:33,570
你们打算怎么让毒素进入空气
How were you gonna get your toxin into the air?

1179
01:41:33,990 --> 01:41:37,240
稻草人  稻草人
Scarecrow. Scarecrow.

1180
01:41:37,450 --> 01:41:39,240
你为谁做事  克瑞恩
Who were you working for, Crane?

1181
01:41:41,370 --> 01:41:43,540
已经太晚了
Oh, it's too late.

1182
01:41:44,170 --> 01:41:46,250
你阻止不了了
You can't stop it now.

1183
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:52,880
给你
Here.

1184
01:41:53,050 --> 01:41:55,010
生日快乐  布鲁斯  谢谢  谢谢
Happy birthday, Bruce. Thank you. Thanks.

1185
01:41:55,220 --> 01:41:58,140
谢谢你送的东西
And thank you for that item.

1186
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:00,850
别客气
You're welcome.

1187
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:03,810
- 你一定会派上用处的  - 已经用了
- I know you'll put it to good use.  - I already have.

1188
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:07,900
如果要大规模生产的话  需要多久
How long would it take to manufacture on a large scale?

1189
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:09,570
几星期  怎么
Weeks. Why?

1190
01:42:09,770 --> 01:42:12,900
有人计划用供水系统来散播这种毒素
Somebody's planning to disperse the toxin using the water supply.

1191
01:42:13,950 --> 01:42:17,030
那是吸入剂  供水系统传播不了
The water supply won't help you disperse an inhalant.

1192
01:42:17,950 --> 01:42:19,330
什么
What?

1193
01:42:19,530 --> 01:42:22,040
除非有一台足够强劲的微波发射器
Unless you have a microwave emitter powerful enough...

1194
01:42:22,250 --> 01:42:25,080
把水管里的所有的水都蒸发掉
to vaporize all the water in the mains.

1195
01:42:25,540 --> 01:42:28,790
就像韦恩企业刚失踪的那种微波发射器
A microwave emitter like the one Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.

1196
01:42:29,250 --> 01:42:30,420
刚失踪的
Misplaced?

1197
01:42:30,630 --> 01:42:34,090
因为我问了太多问题  厄尔刚刚把我给炒了
Earle just fired me for asking too many questions about it.

1198
01:42:36,130 --> 01:42:39,600
你现在立刻回到韦恩企业  开始大批量生产那解药
Go back to Wayne Enterprises now and start making more of that antidote.

1199
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:42,890
我想警察用得上  而且越多越好  好吗
The police are gonna need as much as they can get their hands on.

1200
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:45,140
可我的安全出入证被收回了
My security clearance has been revoked.

1201
01:42:45,350 --> 01:42:47,310
这难不倒你这样的人  对吗
That wouldn't stop a man like you, would it?

1202
01:42:47,770 --> 01:42:49,480
应该难不倒
I suppose not.

1203
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:56,150
- 布鲁斯  这来了一位客人  你一定得见见 - 现在不行  戴妮
- Bruce, there's somebody you must meet. - Not now, Mrs. Delane.

1204
01:42:56,360 --> 01:42:59,200
好了  但愿我能念对
Now, am I pronouncing this right...

1205
01:42:59,410 --> 01:43:01,830
先生叫拉斯・阿・古
Mr. Ra's al Ghul?

1206
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:09,290
你不是拉斯・阿・古
You're not Ra's al Ghul.

1207
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:12,090
我看着他死的
I watched him die.

1208
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:15,300
可是拉斯・阿・古是不朽之神
But is Ra's al Ghul immortal?

1209
01:43:18,090 --> 01:43:20,510
他的功力是超自然的
Are his methods supernatural?

1210
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:29,480
或是用雕虫小技掩盖你的真实身份  拉斯
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal your true identity, Ra's?

1211
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:35,820
像你这样一个每天晚上在哥谭的房顶上乱窜的人
Surely a man who spends his nights scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...

1212
01:43:36,030 --> 01:43:38,030
不会介意我的双重身份
wouldn't begrudge me dual identities.

1213
01:43:38,910 --> 01:43:40,700
我救了你的命
I saved your life.

1214
01:43:40,870 --> 01:43:43,330
我警告过你不能手下留情  布鲁斯
I warned you about compassion, Bruce.

1215
01:43:46,540 --> 01:43:48,710
这是你我的事
Your quarrel is with me.

1216
01:43:49,620 --> 01:43:52,080
放其他人走
You let these people go.

1217
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:55,630
你完全可以自己跟他们说明情况
You are welcome to explain the situation to them.

1218
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:59,550
大家注意
Everyone.

1219
01:44:00,340 --> 01:44:02,180
都听好了
Everybody?

1220
01:44:04,810 --> 01:44:06,680
我
I...

1221
01:44:07,140 --> 01:44:11,350
我想谢谢大家的到来  以及喝光了我家里的酒
I want to thank you all for coming here tonight and drinking all of my booze.

1222
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:15,190
不  说真的
No, really.

1223
01:44:16,230 --> 01:44:18,990
作为韦恩家族成员的好处就是
There's a thing about being a Wayne...

1224
01:44:19,150 --> 01:44:22,700
从来不缺白吃白喝的朋友  就像你们
that you're never short of a few freeloaders, like yourselves...

1225
01:44:22,910 --> 01:44:26,540
你们令我蓬荜生辉  所以这一杯敬你们  谢谢
to fill up your mansion with. So here's to you people. Thank you.

1226
01:44:26,740 --> 01:44:27,830
够了  布鲁斯
That's enough, Bruce.

1227
01:44:27,830 --> 01:44:28,830
我还没说完呢
I'm not finished.

1228
01:44:29,710 --> 01:44:31,420
敬你们这帮
To all of you...

1229
01:44:31,580 --> 01:44:35,960
这帮伪君子  敬你们这帮两面派...
All of you phonies, all of you two-faced friends

1230
01:44:36,130 --> 01:44:41,180
这帮阿谀奉承的马屁精  露着龅牙朝我假笑
you sycophantic suck-ups who smile through your teeth at me...

1231
01:44:41,380 --> 01:44:44,930
拜托  让我安静一下
please, leave me in peace.

1232
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:47,720
拜托  快走
Please go.

1233
01:44:48,100 --> 01:44:51,480
别再笑了  我不开玩笑  快走吧
Stop smiling, it's not a joke. Please leave.

1234
01:44:51,690 --> 01:44:53,850
派对结束了  滚吧
The party's over, get out.

1235
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:57,320
韦恩家族到你这一代就变种了  韦恩先生
The apple has fallen very far from the tree, Mr. Wayne.

1236
01:45:10,750 --> 01:45:12,460
挺有趣
Amusing.

1237
01:45:12,790 --> 01:45:16,210
可毫无意义  这些人都活不多久了
But pointless. None of these people have long to live.

1238
01:45:16,420 --> 01:45:19,880
你在疯人院干的事逼得我动手
Your antics at the asylum have forced my hand.

1239
01:45:20,090 --> 01:45:22,220
那么克瑞恩的确为你做事
So Crane was working for you.

1240
01:45:22,430 --> 01:45:26,220
他的毒素是从我们那蓝色花的有机化合物中提炼的
His toxin is derived from the organic compound found in our blue flowers.

1241
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:28,600
他将其做成武器
He was able to weaponize it.

1242
01:45:28,810 --> 01:45:30,770
可他不是影武者联盟的成员
He's not a member of the League of Shadows?

1243
01:45:30,980 --> 01:45:35,520
当然不是  他以为我们的计划是控制城市  勒索赎金
Of course not. He thought our plan was to hold the city to ransom.

1244
01:45:36,230 --> 01:45:40,780
可实际上  你们是想把克瑞恩的毒药投遍全城
But really, you are gonna release Crane's poison on the entire city.

1245
01:45:40,940 --> 01:45:44,990
然后看着哥谭市在一片恐惧中分崩离析
Then watch Gotham tear itself apart through fear.

1246
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:59,710
你会毁灭数百万条生命
You're gonna destroy millions of lives.

1247
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:03,300
只有愤世嫉俗之人才会觉得这也叫生活  韦恩
Only a cynical man would call what these people have "lives," Wayne.

1248
01:46:03,470 --> 01:46:05,260
犯罪  绝望
Crime. Despair.

1249
01:46:05,470 --> 01:46:07,510
真正的生命里不该有这些
This is not how man was supposed to live.

1250
01:46:08,180 --> 01:46:11,110
影武者联盟一直致力于阻止人类走向堕落
The League of Shadows has been a check against human corruption

1251
01:46:11,110 --> 01:46:12,980
已有数千年了
for thousands of years.

1252
01:46:13,180 --> 01:46:16,730
我们毁灭了罗马  把瘟疫老鼠装进商船
We sacked Rome. Loaded trade ships with plague rats.

1253
01:46:16,940 --> 01:46:18,310
将伦敦烧成了灰烬
Burned London to the ground.

1254
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:21,360
每一次  只要有一种文明腐朽到了极点
Every time a civilization reaches the pinnacle of its decadence

1255
01:46:21,530 --> 01:46:23,490
我们就清除它  恢复平衡
we return to restore the balance.

1256
01:46:23,650 --> 01:46:25,200
哥谭还没不可救药
Gotham isn't beyond saving.

1257
01:46:26,530 --> 01:46:29,200
再给我一些时间  这儿还有好人
Give me more time. There are good people here.

1258
01:46:29,410 --> 01:46:31,200
你还在维护这么腐败的城市
You're defending a city so corrupt

1259
01:46:31,410 --> 01:46:34,580
她的所有机构已被我们层层渗透
we have infiltrated every level of its infrastructure.

1260
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:47,050
该上场了
Time to play.

1261
01:46:51,220 --> 01:46:53,890
我在那座监狱里发现你时  你迷失了方向
When I found you in that jail, you were lost.

1262
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:56,140
可我对你有信心
But I believed in you.

1263
01:46:56,350 --> 01:47:00,060
我赶走了你的恐惧  为你指出一条路
I took away your fear, and I showed you a path.

1264
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:02,570
你是我最棒的学生
You were my greatest student.

1265
01:47:02,900 --> 01:47:06,030
你本该待在我的身边  并肩拯救世界
It should be you standing by my side, saving the world.

1266
01:47:06,860 --> 01:47:09,450
我要待在我该待的地方
I'll be standing where I belong.

1267
01:47:10,120 --> 01:47:13,200
在你和哥谭的人民之间
Between you and the people of Gotham.

1268
01:47:14,910 --> 01:47:17,500
没人能救哥谭
No one can save Gotham.

1269
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:25,510
森林不断疯长  那么一场大火也就在所难免了
When a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural.

1270
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:31,390
明天  全世界将惊恐地目睹这个城市自我毁灭
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror as its greatest city destroys itself.

1271
01:47:31,970 --> 01:47:35,220
这次回归和谐的道路  终将畅通无阻
The movement back to harmony will be unstoppable this time.

1272
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:36,690
你们袭击过哥谭
You attacked Gotham before?

1273
01:47:36,690 --> 01:47:37,690
当然
Of course.

1274
01:47:37,940 --> 01:47:40,610
千百年来  我们的武器已经越来越先进
Over the ages our weapons have grown more sophisticated.

1275
01:47:40,770 --> 01:47:43,610
对哥谭我们用了新武器  就是经济
With Gotham we tried a new one. Economics.

1276
01:47:44,070 --> 01:47:48,740
不过  我们当时却低估了某些哥谭市民的力量
But we underestimated certain of Gotham's citizens

1277
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:51,370
比如你父母
such as your parents.

1278
01:47:55,450 --> 01:47:58,920
他们被自己想要帮助的对象中的一员  开枪打死
Gunned down by one of the very people they were trying to help.

1279
01:47:59,210 --> 01:48:01,960
当人们饥饿难耐的时候  人人都能变成罪犯
Create enough hunger and everyone becomes a criminal.

1280
01:48:02,170 --> 01:48:04,590
他们的死唤醒了市民的自救意识
Their deaths galvanized the city into saving itself

1281
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:07,470
从此以后  哥谭得以苟延残喘
and Gotham has limped on ever since.

1282
01:48:07,670 --> 01:48:09,470
我们回来终结这任务
We are back to finish the job.

1283
01:48:10,180 --> 01:48:13,430
这一次不会有什么大善人挡我们道了
And this time no misguided idealists will get in the way.

1284
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:17,140
你就像你父亲  缺乏勇气去做你必须做的事
Like your father, you lack the courage to do all that is necessary.

1285
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:20,310
如果有人阻碍真正的正义
If someone stands in the way of true justice

1286
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:24,570
你就该跑到他们后面   一刀刺入他的心脏
you simply walk up behind them and stab them in the heart.

1287
01:48:29,610 --> 01:48:30,740
我要阻止你
I am gonna stop you.

1288
01:48:30,740 --> 01:48:31,740
你就是学不会
You never did learn...

1289
01:48:31,950 --> 01:48:33,950
眼观六路  耳听八方
to mind your surroundings.

1290
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:38,120
正义就是平衡
Justice is balance.

1291
01:48:38,330 --> 01:48:40,460
你烧了我的家  留下我自生自灭
You burned my house and left me for dead.

1292
01:48:43,170 --> 01:48:45,290
现在扯平了
Consider us even.

1293
01:49:01,730 --> 01:49:03,440
确保没有人逃出来
No one comes out. Make sure.

1294
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:14,820
全都逃了吗
They're all gone?

1295
01:49:14,990 --> 01:49:16,740
高度设防区逃了多少犯人
How many from maximum security?

1296
01:49:16,740 --> 01:49:17,740
他们全都逃了
Every one of them.

1297
01:49:17,910 --> 01:49:19,700
连环杀手  强奸犯
Serial killers, rapists.

1298
01:49:19,910 --> 01:49:22,750
让他们把桥升起来  谁都不能逃出这个岛
Raise the bridges. We don't want any getting off the island.

1299
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:24,380
好  我会去办的
Yeah, I'll raise the bridges

1300
01:49:24,540 --> 01:49:28,750
等我先把所有警力调回来  抓住那些变态杀人狂
when I get every available unit out here to catch the homicidal maniacs

1301
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:31,800
他们逃得正欢呢  快点
that are running loose out there. Come on!

1302
01:49:55,030 --> 01:49:57,780
但愿你不是消防大队的一员
I hope you're not a member of the fire brigade.

1303
01:50:03,790 --> 01:50:05,880
韦恩少爷  韦恩少爷
Master Wayne! Master Wayne!

1304
01:50:10,420 --> 01:50:14,800
你做那些俯卧撑有什么用  如果连根该死的木头都抬不起
What is the point of all those pushups if you can't even lift a bloody log?

1305
01:50:53,260 --> 01:50:55,300
我都干了些什么呀
What have I done, Alfred?

1306
01:50:56,340 --> 01:50:58,260
家族的一切
Everything my family

1307
01:50:58,470 --> 01:51:00,350
父亲的心血
my father, built

1308
01:51:02,770 --> 01:51:06,640
韦恩的遗产不光是砖头和水泥  少爷
The Wayne legacy is more than bricks and mortar, sir.

1309
01:51:06,850 --> 01:51:09,060
我本想拯救哥谭
I wanted to save Gotham.

1310
01:51:09,940 --> 01:51:11,770
可失败了
I failed.

1311
01:51:13,030 --> 01:51:14,280
我们为什么摔跤
Why do we fall, sir?

1312
01:51:17,490 --> 01:51:20,950
是为了学会自己爬起来
So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.

1313
01:51:23,450 --> 01:51:25,580
还没对我丧失信心吗
You still haven't given up on me?

1314
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:28,960
从来没有
Never.

1315
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:31,340
趴下
Down!

1316
01:51:31,540 --> 01:51:34,460
滥用暴力  警察滥用暴力
Harassment! I see harassment!

1317
01:51:34,630 --> 01:51:36,670
也许你想见识更暴力的  是吗
Maybe you'd like to see some excessive force?

1318
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:38,760
拿枪的疯子
Madman with a gun.

1319
01:51:39,970 --> 01:51:44,990
警察全力围捕犯人  场面非常混乱  愤怒的居民情绪有些失控
With residents furious at the unprecedented show of police strength to round up the inmates

1320
01:51:44,990 --> 01:51:46,850
小姐  我们马上要升桥了
We're about to raise these bridges.

1321
01:51:47,060 --> 01:51:50,650
警官  我是哥谭市检察院的  让我过去
Officer, I am a Gotham City district attorney. Let me pass.

1322
01:51:58,070 --> 01:52:00,320
- 你给我闭嘴  - 嗨  弗拉斯  冷静
- Just shut up!  - Hey, Flass, cool it!

1323
01:52:00,530 --> 01:52:01,780
把这些人挡回去
Hold these people back.

1324
01:52:01,990 --> 01:52:04,990
嗨  戈登  有人要见你
Hey, Gordon. Somebody here to see you.

1325
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:06,140
你来这干什么
What are you doing here?

1326
01:52:06,140 --> 01:52:07,540
我们共同的朋友让我交给你
Our friend sent me with this.

1327
01:52:07,750 --> 01:52:09,210
它能解克瑞恩的毒
It counteracts Crane's toxin.

1328
01:52:09,370 --> 01:52:10,830
希望你不会用到
Hopefully you won't need it.

1329
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:14,170
除非有人能够把那玩意儿散到空气中
Not unless he's got some way of getting that crap into the air.

1330
01:52:15,340 --> 01:52:17,760
好吧 最后一辆过桥
All right, last one across.

1331
01:52:18,470 --> 01:52:22,350
好了各位  不到三分钟这桥就要升起来了
People, they want this bridge up in no more than three minutes!

1332
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:25,930
你最好在大桥升起之前离开这个岛  巡警
Better get you off the island before they raise the bridges. Patrolman!

1333
01:52:26,600 --> 01:52:27,600
走
Go!

1334
01:52:54,420 --> 01:52:56,210
我找不到妈妈
I can't find my mom.

1335
01:52:56,590 --> 01:52:58,050
嗨
Hey!

1336
01:53:06,470 --> 01:53:08,180
你这是在干什么
What the hell are you doing?

1337
01:53:09,730 --> 01:53:11,270
先生们
Gentlemen

1338
01:53:11,730 --> 01:53:14,230
传达讯号的时间到了
time to spread the word.

1339
01:53:15,980 --> 01:53:17,360
这个讯号就是 
And the word is...

1340
01:53:18,650 --> 01:53:20,360
恐慌
panic.

1341
01:53:43,670 --> 01:53:46,100
我的天  水压一下子升高了
Jesus. The pressure, it's spiking.

1342
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:48,390
就在那儿
Right there.

1343
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:50,930
那总水管就在纳罗斯岛下面
That water main is right under the Narrows.

1344
01:54:07,910 --> 01:54:09,450
没事了
It's okay.

1345
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:43,860
我是洛布局长
This is Commissioner Loeb.

1346
01:54:44,030 --> 01:54:45,740
快点  那边的人快回话
Come on, somebody talk to me.

1347
01:54:45,910 --> 01:54:47,370
快啊
Come on!

1348
01:55:07,050 --> 01:55:09,050
听见吗  我是戈登
Loeb, Loeb. This is Gordon.

1349
01:55:09,390 --> 01:55:10,680
那儿在搞什么鬼
What the hell is going on?

1350
01:55:10,890 --> 01:55:14,310
我们需要增援  战术小组  特警  防暴警察
We need reinforcements. TAC teams, SWAT, riot cops!

1351
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:18,730
戈登  城里所有的防暴警察都在岛上  在你那儿
Gordon! All the city's riot police are on the island with you!

1352
01:55:18,900 --> 01:55:20,900
可他们一点用处都没有
Well, they're completely incapacitated!

1353
01:55:21,230 --> 01:55:25,190
没事了  没事了  没人会伤害你
It's okay, it's okay. No one's gonna hurt you.

1354
01:55:26,070 --> 01:55:27,700
谁说不会伤害
Of course they are!

1355
01:55:27,910 --> 01:55:28,910
克瑞恩
Crane?

1356
01:55:28,910 --> 01:55:30,910
不  稻草人
No. Scarecrow.

1357
01:55:32,660 --> 01:55:34,040
戈登
Gordon

1358
01:55:34,250 --> 01:55:36,460
我这儿已经派不出人了
there's nobody left to send in.

1359
01:55:38,040 --> 01:55:39,750
只剩下我一个
So I'm on my own?

1360
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:45,460
纳罗斯岛快要被扯碎了
The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces.

1361
01:55:45,670 --> 01:55:48,220
这只是开始  如果他们将毒药释放到整座城市
This is just the beginning. If they hit the whole city

1362
01:55:48,430 --> 01:55:51,180
整个哥谭都会被全民恐慌扯得粉碎
there's nothing to stop Gotham tearing itself apart.

1363
01:55:51,350 --> 01:55:52,320
他们怎么做得到
How are they gonna do that?

1364
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:53,320
他们会用火车
The train.

1365
01:55:53,430 --> 01:55:57,230
单轨铁路  顺着水管通向韦恩大厦地下的中枢
The monorail follows the water mains to the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.

1366
01:55:57,440 --> 01:55:59,150
要是他们把机器弄进韦恩站
If the machine gets to the station

1367
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:02,770
就会引发连锁反应  把城里的所有的水都蒸发
it'll cause a chain reaction that'll vaporize the city's water supply.

1368
01:56:02,980 --> 01:56:04,530
那样哥谭就被毒素笼罩
Covering Gotham in this poison.

1369
01:56:04,730 --> 01:56:07,900
我去阻止他把那机器装上火车  可需要你帮忙
I'm gonna stop him from loading that train, but I may need your help.

1370
01:56:08,110 --> 01:56:09,900
- 帮什么忙  - 手排档会开吗
- What do you need?  - Can you drive stick?

1371
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:17,790
你们在这儿
There you are!

1372
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,960
唯一让我们恐惧的
There is nothing to fear...

1373
01:56:20,170 --> 01:56:21,880
就是恐惧本身
but fear itself!

1374
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:25,250
我是来拯救你们的
I am here to help!

1375
01:56:56,490 --> 01:56:58,620
蝙蝠侠会救我们的  他会来的
Batman will save us. He'll come.

1376
01:57:03,880 --> 01:57:04,850
他会来的
He'll come.

1377
01:57:04,850 --> 01:57:05,850
别偷看
Don't peek.

1378
01:57:14,430 --> 01:57:17,770
我是戈登  准备把桥降下来
This is Gordon. Prepare to lower the bridge.

1379
01:57:23,690 --> 01:57:25,770
我说过他会来的
I told you he'd come.

1380
01:57:30,820 --> 01:57:32,450
等等
Wait.

1381
01:57:33,410 --> 01:57:35,030
你也许会死
You could die.

1382
01:57:35,200 --> 01:57:36,450
至少告诉我你的名字
At least tell me your name.

1383
01:57:41,870 --> 01:57:44,040
关键不是看内心
It's not who I am underneath

1384
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:49,340
而是看我的所作所为
but what I do that defines me.

1385
01:57:49,710 --> 01:57:51,010
布鲁斯
Bruce?

1386
01:58:24,750 --> 01:58:28,040
噢  你还真听我的建议演戏了  真听话
Well, well. You took my advice about theatricality a bit literally.

1387
01:58:28,250 --> 01:58:29,310
该结束了
It ends here.

1388
01:58:29,310 --> 01:58:30,710
你和警察也许快完了
For you and the police, maybe.

1389
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:33,220
可我还得对付哥谭剩下的人
My fight, however, lies with the rest of Gotham.

1390
01:58:33,420 --> 01:58:36,720
好了  失陪了  整座城市等着我摧毁
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a city to destroy.

1391
01:58:36,930 --> 01:58:39,000
难道我打不过你两个手下
I can't beat two of your pawns?

1392
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,600
如你所愿
As you wish.

1393
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:55,740
全球定位已上线
GPS online.

1394
01:59:02,620 --> 01:59:04,790
现在距离100码
In 100 yards.

1395
01:59:35,700 --> 01:59:36,950
先生们
Gentlemen.

1396
02:00:04,390 --> 02:00:06,600
这是谁下的命令
Who the hell authorized this?

1397
02:00:17,190 --> 02:00:19,240
距离韦恩大厦  三英里
Distance to Wayne Tower, three miles.

1398
02:00:26,540 --> 02:00:29,120
高压竖直管道移动时把水管都炸开了
The pressure's moving along the mains, blowing the pipes.

1399
02:00:29,330 --> 02:00:30,710
如果高压到了这儿
If that pressure reaches us

1400
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:33,880
那么贯穿全城的供水系统将会崩溃
the water supply right across the whole city is gonna blow!

1401
02:00:44,350 --> 02:00:47,180
在下一个交叉口  右转
At the next intersection, turn right.

1402
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:13,380
你不吸取教训
You will never learn.

1403
02:01:20,930 --> 02:01:21,930
抱歉
Sorry.

1404
02:01:25,930 --> 02:01:27,930
还是老招式  难到你没有新招吗
Familiar. Don't you have anything new?

1405
02:01:27,930 --> 02:01:28,930
这招怎样
How about this?!

1406
02:01:45,700 --> 02:01:47,950
您已到达韦恩大厦
You have arrived at Wayne Tower.

1407
02:02:01,300 --> 02:02:02,510
疏散大楼里的人
Evacuate the building.

1408
02:02:02,760 --> 02:02:05,220
我们就在中心顶部  它马上要爆炸了
We're on top of the main hub and it's gonna blow.

1409
02:02:14,150 --> 02:02:16,310
武器系统启动
Weapons system activated.

1410
02:02:20,440 --> 02:02:21,440
这车够靓
Nice ride.

1411
02:02:36,710 --> 02:02:37,710
武器就绪
Armed.

1412
02:02:49,680 --> 02:02:51,140
不要怕  布鲁斯
Don't be afraid, Bruce.

1413
02:02:53,940 --> 02:02:55,310
来吧  来吧
Come on. Come on.

1414
02:03:00,070 --> 02:03:02,110
你只是一个披着斗篷的凡人
You are just an ordinary man in a cape.

1415
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:04,330
所以你没法抗击不公
That's why you couldn't fight injustice,

1416
02:03:04,340 --> 02:03:06,160
所以你没法让这火车停下
that's why you can't stop this train.

1417
02:03:06,360 --> 02:03:08,910
谁说我要让火车停下
Who said anything about stopping it?

1418
02:03:14,750 --> 02:03:16,290
太好了
Yes!

1419
02:03:24,470 --> 02:03:27,840
就算你眼观六路  也无济于事了
You never learned to mind your surroundings!

1420
02:03:35,730 --> 02:03:38,190
你终于学会  必须做该做之事了吗
Have you finally learned to do what is necessary?

1421
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:40,770
我不会杀你的
I won't kill you

1422
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:47,360
但我也不必救你
but I don't have to save you.

1423
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:03,650
会议已经开始了
The meeting's already started.

1424
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:05,650
什么  会议
What meeting?

1425
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:12,820
福克斯  我记得已经解雇你了
Fox, I seem to remember firing you.

1426
02:05:13,320 --> 02:05:14,870
没错
You did.

1427
02:05:15,080 --> 02:05:17,120
我有新职位了
I got another job.

1428
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:19,460
你的
Yours.

1429
02:05:19,910 --> 02:05:21,620
是谁任命的
On whose authority?

1430
02:05:22,250 --> 02:05:24,130
蝙蝠侠也许占据了头版头条
Batman may have made the front page...

1431
02:05:24,380 --> 02:05:27,300
可布鲁斯・韦恩被挪到了第八版
but Bruce Wayne got pushed to page eight.

1432
02:05:34,100 --> 02:05:35,100
布鲁斯・韦恩
Bruce Wayne.

1433
02:05:35,300 --> 02:05:39,060
你凭什么认为  你能决定由谁来掌管韦恩企业
What makes you think you can decide who's running Wayne Enterprises?

1434
02:05:39,270 --> 02:05:41,020
因为我是公司老板
The fact that I'm the owner.

1435
02:05:41,020 --> 02:05:42,020
你在说什么呢
What are you talking about?

1436
02:05:42,270 --> 02:05:44,150
公司一个星期以前上市了啊
The company went public a week ago.

1437
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:45,820
我买下了大多数股份
And I bought most of the shares.

1438
02:05:46,190 --> 02:05:49,610
通过各种慈善基金会和信托基金会什么的
Through various charitable foundations and trusts and so forth.

1439
02:05:49,820 --> 02:05:53,240
你看  这事有那么点复杂  不过重要的
Look, it's all a bit technical, but the important thing...

1440
02:05:53,240 --> 02:05:56,490
是我的公司未来很有保障
is that my company's future is secure.

1441
02:05:56,910 --> 02:05:58,290
对吗  福克斯先生
Right, Mr. Fox?

1442
02:05:58,490 --> 02:06:00,290
对极了  韦恩先生
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.

1443
02:06:02,540 --> 02:06:04,080
你没接到通知吗
Didn't you get the memo?

1444
02:06:23,060 --> 02:06:25,030
对不起我没告诉你  瑞切尔
I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Rachel.

1445
02:06:25,030 --> 02:06:26,230
不  不  布鲁斯
No. No, Bruce...

1446
02:06:26,440 --> 02:06:27,820
该我道歉
I'm sorry.

1447
02:06:28,690 --> 02:06:31,360
齐尔死的那一天  我
The day that Chill died, I...

1448
02:06:33,240 --> 02:06:34,860
说了些难听的话
I said terrible things.

1449
02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:37,070
可那是真话
But true things.

1450
02:06:37,740 --> 02:06:39,540
我是拿着枪的懦夫
I was a coward with a gun...

1451
02:06:39,740 --> 02:06:42,630
伸张正义不仅仅是复仇
and justice is about more than revenge,

1452
02:06:42,630 --> 02:06:43,500
所以谢谢你
so thank you.

1453
02:06:44,580 --> 02:06:47,250
一直以来  我都在想着你
I never stopped thinking about you.

1454
02:06:48,750 --> 02:06:50,380
想着你跟我
About us.

1455
02:06:51,010 --> 02:06:52,970
一听说你回来  我就
And when I heard you were back, I...

1456
02:06:53,800 --> 02:06:55,970
开始期盼
I started to hope.

1457
02:07:20,080 --> 02:07:22,750
可后来我发现了你的面具
But then I found out about your mask.

1458
02:07:23,960 --> 02:07:26,790
蝙蝠侠只是一种象征  瑞切尔
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.

1459
02:07:27,420 --> 02:07:29,040
不  这才是
No. This...

1460
02:07:30,570 --> 02:07:31,960
你的面具
is your mask.

1461
02:07:33,920 --> 02:07:37,430
你的真实身份才是犯罪分子所恐惧的
Your real face is the one that criminals now fear.

1462
02:07:38,300 --> 02:07:40,260
我爱过的人
The man I loved...

1463
02:07:41,010 --> 02:07:42,470
那个消失的人
the man who vanished...

1464
02:07:43,680 --> 02:07:45,810
他再也没有回来
he never came back at all.

1465
02:07:50,310 --> 02:07:52,980
也许他还在世界上的某个地方
But maybe he's still out there somewhere.

1466
02:07:55,150 --> 02:07:58,820
也许  等到哥谭不再需要蝙蝠侠的那一天
Maybe someday, when Gotham no longer needs Batman...

1467
02:07:59,910 --> 02:08:01,870
我能再见到他
I'll see him again.

1468
02:08:12,920 --> 02:08:14,840
那天我真的说错了
Proved me wrong, you know.

1469
02:08:14,840 --> 02:08:15,840
什么错了
About what?

1470
02:08:18,680 --> 02:08:21,100
你父亲会为你感到骄傲的
Your father would be very proud of you.

1471
02:08:21,350 --> 02:08:22,970
我也是
Just like me.

1472
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:51,830
你打算怎么办
What will you do?

1473
02:08:53,210 --> 02:08:54,750
重建
Rebuild it.

1474
02:08:55,670 --> 02:08:58,010
一砖一瓦  恢复原样
Just the way it was, brick for brick.

1475
02:09:04,890 --> 02:09:06,100
按原样重建吗 先生
Just the way it was, sir?

1476
02:09:08,230 --> 02:09:09,440
对  怎么了
Yeah, why?

1477
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:12,480
我原本以为这是个好机会  可以
I thought this might be a good opportunity for...

1478
02:09:12,650 --> 02:09:15,070
加固一下地基
improving the foundations.

1479
02:09:15,270 --> 02:09:17,190
你是说东南角吗
In the southeast corner?

1480
02:09:17,190 --> 02:09:18,190
对  少爷
Precisely, sir.

1481
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:34,950
很好
Nice.

1482
02:09:34,950 --> 02:09:36,750
我一时找不到黑帮老大
I couldn't find any mob bosses.

1483
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:39,020
你好吗  队长
Well, sergeant?

1484
02:09:39,020 --> 02:09:40,420
现在升警长了
It's "lieutenant" now.

1485
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:42,260
你真的改变了现状
You really started something.

1486
02:09:42,470 --> 02:09:44,430
那些腐败警察都怕了
Bent cops running scared.

1487
02:09:44,640 --> 02:09:46,010
这城市又有希望了
Hope on the streets.

1488
02:09:46,310 --> 02:09:47,390
然而
But?

1489
02:09:47,390 --> 02:09:49,890
纳罗斯岛算是完了
The Narrows is lost.

1490
02:09:50,430 --> 02:09:54,270
而且我们还是没抓到克瑞恩  和一半被他放走的疯子犯人
And we still haven't picked up Crane or half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.

1491
02:09:54,980 --> 02:09:56,610
会抓到的
We will.

1492
02:09:56,820 --> 02:09:58,440
我们可以拯救哥谭
We can bring Gotham back.

1493
02:09:58,650 --> 02:10:00,110
那么该升级了吧
What about escalation?

1494
02:10:00,110 --> 02:10:01,110
什么升级
Escalation?

1495
02:10:01,320 --> 02:10:05,620
我们用半自动武器时  罪犯都买全自动了
We start carrying semiautomatics, they buy automatics.

1496
02:10:05,830 --> 02:10:10,120
我们穿凯夫拉防弹衣  他们就买穿甲弹
We start wearing Kevlar, they buy armor-piercing rounds.

1497
02:10:10,330 --> 02:10:11,580
还有呢
And?

1498
02:10:11,580 --> 02:10:13,580
还有  你戴着个面具
And you're wearing a mask...

1499
02:10:14,040 --> 02:10:15,920
并且到处飞檐走壁
and jumping off rooftops.

1500
02:10:17,340 --> 02:10:19,200
来看看这个家伙
Now, take this guy.

1501
02:10:19,630 --> 02:10:21,630
武装抢劫  双重谋杀
Armed robbery, double homicide.

1502
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:25,090
喜爱戏剧性效果  跟你一样
Got a taste for the theatrical, like you.

1503
02:10:25,340 --> 02:10:27,260
还留了张名片呢
Leaves a calling card.

1504
02:10:33,190 --> 02:10:34,980
我会仔细查查
I'll look into it.

1505
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:39,940
我还没对你说过感谢
I never said thank you.

1506
02:10:45,030 --> 02:10:47,100
你也永远不用谢我
And you'll never have to.
