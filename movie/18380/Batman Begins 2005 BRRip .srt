失竊的？

1176
01:38:22,971 --> 01:38:26,327
Go back to Wayne Enterprises now and start making more of that antidote.
厄爾開除了我 就是因為我問的問題多

1177
01:38:26,327 --> 01:38:29,483
The police are gonna need as much as they can get their hands on.
我需要你立即返回韋恩企業 開始生產盡可能多的解毒劑

1178
01:38:29,483 --> 01:38:31,642
My security clearance has been revoked.
我認為警察很快就會有 大量的需求的

1179
01:38:31,642 --> 01:38:33,722
That wouldn't stop a man like you, would it?
我的出入證已經被吊銷了

1180
01:38:34,131 --> 01:38:35,769
I suppose not.
我認為這點事難不到你吧？

1181
01:38:37,731 --> 01:38:42,202
- Bruce, there's somebody you must meet. - Not now, Mrs. Delane.
應該是吧

1182
01:38:42,202 --> 01:38:45,124
Now, am I pronouncing this right...
-布魯斯 有個人想見見你 你有時間嗎？ -現在不行 德林夫人

1183
01:38:45,124 --> 01:38:47,646
...Mr. Ra's al Ghul?
那麼 我的念法對嗎？...

1184
01:38:53,051 --> 01:38:54,769
You're not Ra's al Ghul.
...拉.阿勒古爾先生

1185
01:38:56,251 --> 01:38:57,479
I watched him die.
你不是拉.阿勒古爾

1186
01:38:57,479 --> 01:39:00,563
DUCARD: But is Ra's al Ghul immortal?
我親眼看見他死的

1187
01:39:03,211 --> 01:39:05,566
Are his methods supernatural?
杜卡德:可拉.阿勒古爾不是不朽的嗎？

1188
01:39:09,931 --> 01:39:14,163
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal your true identity, Ra's?
他的意念不是超越現實的嗎？

1189
01:39:15,931 --> 01:39:20,243
Surely a man who spends his nights scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...
或者簡單的易容術就能隱藏起 你的真實面目把 杜卡德

1190
01:39:20,243 --> 01:39:22,367
...wouldn't begrudge me dual identities.
當然了 一個半夜裡到處爬屋頂的人...

1191
01:39:23,171 --> 01:39:24,889
I saved your life.
...恐怕不會抱怨我的雙重身份吧？

1192
01:39:24,889 --> 01:39:27,440
I warned you about compassion, Bruce.
我救了你的命

1193
01:39:30,491 --> 01:39:32,607
Your quarrel is with me.
我提醒過你不能憐憫 布魯斯

1194
01:39:33,451 --> 01:39:35,840
You let these people go.
你是沖著我來的吧？

1195
01:39:36,091 --> 01:39:39,243
You are welcome to explain the situation to them.
讓這些客人走吧

1196
01:39:41,412 --> 01:39:42,970
BRUCE: Everyone.
那就麻煩你給他們解釋一下吧

1197
01:39:43,732 --> 01:39:45,529
Everybody?
布魯斯:諸位

1198
01:39:48,012 --> 01:39:49,809
I...
諸位

1199
01:39:50,252 --> 01:39:54,325
I want to thank you all for coming here tonight and drinking all of my booze.
我...

1200
01:39:54,325 --> 01:39:55,607
[GUESTS LAUGHING]
我很感謝大家今晚能 出席我的生日宴會喝光了我的酒

1201
01:39:56,332 --> 01:39:57,970
No, really.
[笑聲]

1202
01:39:58,972 --> 01:40:01,611
There's a thing about being a Wayne...
不 真的

1203
01:40:01,611 --> 01:40:05,208
...that you're never short of a few freeloaders, like yourselves...
作為韋恩家族的一員我知道...

1204
01:40:05,208 --> 01:40:08,887
...to fill up your mansion with. So here's to you people. Thank you.
...身邊少不了騙吃騙喝的人，就像你們...

1205
01:40:08,887 --> 01:40:11,566
- That's enough, Bruce. - I'm not finished.
...也隻是為了撐場面湊人數 為了諸位干杯 謝謝你們

1206
01:40:11,892 --> 01:40:13,530
To all of you...
-太過分了 布魯斯. -我還沒說完

1207
01:40:13,530 --> 01:40:17,890
All of you phonies, all of you two-faced friends...
為你們這些....

1208
01:40:17,890 --> 01:40:22,921
...you sycophantic suck-ups who smile through your teeth at me...
所有這些虛偽的家伙 所有這些兩面三刀的朋友...

1209
01:40:22,921 --> 01:40:26,528
...please, leave me in peace.
...所有這些阿諛奉承之人 以及勢力的小人們...

1210
01:40:26,528 --> 01:40:29,206
Please go.
...請你們讓我清靜清靜吧

1211
01:40:29,532 --> 01:40:32,808
Stop smiling, it's not a joke. Please leave.
請你們走吧

1212
01:40:32,808 --> 01:40:35,088
The party's over, get out.
收起你們的假笑吧 我並不是開玩笑 請大家離開吧

1213
01:40:35,088 --> 01:40:38,369
The apple has fallen very far from the tree, Mr. Wayne.
宴會結束了 現在滾吧

1214
01:40:43,012 --> 01:40:45,207
He's turning into a jerk.
韋恩先生 你與你的 父母真是天壤之別

1215
01:40:51,252 --> 01:40:52,924
Amusing.
他怎麼變得這麼古怪了

1216
01:40:53,212 --> 01:40:56,522
But pointless. None of these people have long to live.
有意思

1217
01:40:56,522 --> 01:41:00,048
Your antics at the asylum have forced my hand.
但是無濟於事 這些人都活不長了

1218
01:41:00,048 --> 01:41:02,282
So Crane was working for you.
你的解毒藥迫使我提前出手

1219
01:41:02,282 --> 01:41:06,127
His toxin is derived from the organic compound found in our blue flowers.
這麼說克蘭是為你工作

1220
01:41:06,452 --> 01:41:08,408
He was able to weaponize it.
他的致幻劑是從我們的 藍色花朵裡提煉出來的

1221
01:41:08,408 --> 01:41:10,483
He's not a member of the League of Shadows?
他把它制成了武器

1222
01:41:10,483 --> 01:41:15,009
Of course not. He thought our plan was to hold the city to ransom.
他並不是影子同盟的成員

1223
01:41:15,692 --> 01:41:20,050
But really, you are gonna release Crane's poison on the entire city.
當然不是 他以為我們要用致幻劑要挾政府呢

1224
01:41:20,050 --> 01:41:24,092
Then watch Gotham tear itself apart through fear.
可你打算用克蘭的毒劑污染整個城市

1225
01:41:36,213 --> 01:41:38,249
BRUCE: You're gonna destroy millions of lives.
然後欣賞整個哥特城陷入恐懼和毀滅的景象

1226
01:41:38,453 --> 01:41:41,763
DUCARD: Only a cynical man would call what these people have "lives," Wayne.
布魯斯:你要毀掉幾百萬人的生命

1227
01:41:41,763 --> 01:41:43,571
Crime. Despair.
杜卡德:隻有瘋子才把這些人的生命當回事 韋恩

1228
01:41:43,571 --> 01:41:45,724
This is not how man was supposed to live.
罪惡 絕望

1229
01:41:46,333 --> 01:41:49,370
The League of Shadows has been a check against human corruption...
人類的生活不該是這個樣

1230
01:41:49,370 --> 01:41:50,966
...for thousands of years.
影子同盟致力於緝查人類的腐敗...

1231
01:41:50,966 --> 01:41:54,569
We sacked Rome. Loaded trade ships with plague rats.
...已歷經千年

1232
01:41:54,569 --> 01:41:56,086
Burned London to the ground.
我們毀滅了羅馬 貨船把鼠疫帶到了世界各個角落

1233
01:41:56,086 --> 01:41:58,972
Every time a civilization reaches the pinnacle of its decadence...
還把倫敦燒成了殘垣斷壁

1234
01:41:58,972 --> 01:42:01,010
...we return to restore the balance.
每一次文明一旦陷入腐敗的泥沼...

1235
01:42:01,010 --> 01:42:02,686
Gotham isn't beyond saving.
...我們就會出來維持平衡

1236
01:42:03,933 --> 01:42:06,527
Give me more time. There are good people here.
哥特城還沒有淪落到 不可救藥的地步

1237
01:42:06,527 --> 01:42:08,445
You're defending a city so corrupt...
給我點時間 這裡還有不少好人

1238
01:42:08,445 --> 01:42:11,650
...we have infiltrated every level of its infrastructure.
你要保護的城市...

1239
01:42:22,293 --> 01:42:23,612
Time to play.
...我們已經滲透到社會的每一個階層

1240
01:42:27,613 --> 01:42:30,173
When I found you in that jail, you were lost.
游戲時間到了

1241
01:42:30,173 --> 01:42:32,369
But I believed in you.
我在監獄裡見到你的時候 你很迷失低落

1242
01:42:32,369 --> 01:42:36,128
I took away your fear, and I showed you a path.
但是現在 我恢復了對你的信心

1243
01:42:36,373 --> 01:42:38,523
You were my greatest student.
我消除了你的恐懼 給你指明了出路

1244
01:42:38,813 --> 01:42:41,850
It should be you standing by my side, saving the world.
你是我的得意門生

1245
01:42:42,613 --> 01:42:45,127
I'll be standing where I belong.
你應該站在我這一邊 拯救世界

1246
01:42:45,733 --> 01:42:48,725
Between you and the people of Gotham.
我將站在我該屬於的一方

1247
01:42:50,333 --> 01:42:52,847
No one can save Gotham.
站在你和哥特城人們中間

1248
01:42:56,053 --> 01:43:00,525
When a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural.
誰也救不了哥特城

1249
01:43:01,694 --> 01:43:06,165
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror as its greatest city destroys itself.
當森林生長得過於茂盛的時候 一場大火的降臨是再自然不過的

1250
01:43:06,694 --> 01:43:09,811
The movement back to harmony will be unstoppable this time.
明天 世界將共同矚目 這個偉大的城市自己毀滅自己

1251
01:43:10,094 --> 01:43:12,210
- You attacked Gotham before? - Of course.
平衡的運動是不可阻擋的

1252
01:43:12,414 --> 01:43:14,974
Over the ages our weapons have grown more sophisticated.
-以前你襲擊過哥特城嗎？ -當然

1253
01:43:14,974 --> 01:43:17,887
With Gotham we tried a new one. Economics.
經過長時間的發展 我們的武器越來越先進

1254
01:43:18,294 --> 01:43:22,810
But we underestimated certain of Gotham's citizens...
在哥特城 我們採用 一種新型武器 經濟

1255
01:43:23,214 --> 01:43:25,330
...such as your parents.
但是我卻低估了哥特城的一些市民...

1256
01:43:29,214 --> 01:43:32,570
Gunned down by one of the very people they were trying to help.
...比如你的父母

1257
01:43:32,814 --> 01:43:35,487
Create enough hunger and everyone becomes a criminal.
結果他們被他們一心要救助的人槍殺了

1258
01:43:35,487 --> 01:43:38,009
Their deaths galvanized the city into saving itself...
無處不在的飢餓使人人變成了罪犯

1259
01:43:38,009 --> 01:43:40,768
...and Gotham has limped on ever since.
他們的死摧毀了這個城市的自救之心...

1260
01:43:40,768 --> 01:43:42,652
We are back to finish the job.
...至此哥特城就一蹶不振了

1261
01:43:43,334 --> 01:43:46,451
And this time no misguided idealists will get in the way.
我們這次來就是了結這一切的

1262
01:43:46,451 --> 01:43:50,050
Like your father, you lack the courage to do all that is necessary.
而這一次絕對不會有不得要領的理想主義者了

1263
01:43:50,334 --> 01:43:53,087
If someone stands in the way of true justice...
跟你父母一樣 你缺乏不惜一切代價的勇氣

1264
01:43:53,087 --> 01:43:57,167
...you simply walk up behind them and stab them in the heart.
如果有人阻擋正義的實現...

1265
01:44:01,974 --> 01:44:04,044
- I am gonna stop you. - You never did learn...
...就應該從他們的背後狠狠地捅上一刀

1266
01:44:04,044 --> 01:44:06,170
...to mind your surroundings.
-我要阻止你 -你還沒學會...

1267
01:44:08,254 --> 01:44:10,165
Justice is balance.
...眼觀六路耳聽八方

1268
01:44:10,165 --> 01:44:12,404
You burned my house and left me for dead.
正義是公平的

1269
01:44:14,974 --> 01:44:17,044
Consider us even.
你曾經燒了我的房子 和置我於死地

1270
01:44:32,774 --> 01:44:34,446
No one comes out. Make sure.
這下扯平了

1271
01:44:43,935 --> 01:44:45,334
GORDON: They're all gone?
不許任何人出來 明白？

1272
01:44:45,334 --> 01:44:48,134
- How many from maximum security? - Every one of them.
戈登:人都跑了

1273
01:44:48,134 --> 01:44:50,013
Serial killers, rapists.
-重點看護區跑了多少 -都跑了

1274
01:44:50,215 --> 01:44:52,934
Raise the bridges. We don't want any getting off the island.
連環殺手 強奸犯

1275
01:44:52,934 --> 01:44:54,687
FLASS: Yeah, I'll raise the bridges...
把吊橋吊起來 不能讓他們逃離這個島

1276
01:44:54,687 --> 01:44:58,734
...when I get every available unit out here to catch the homicidal maniacs...
福拉斯:好 我去吊吊橋...

1277
01:44:58,734 --> 01:45:01,648
...that are running loose out there. - Come on!
...我先去調集所有能調集的人馬...

1278
01:45:23,895 --> 01:45:26,534
I hope you're not a member of the fire brigade.
-...一起來這裡抓那些逃出去的瘋子 -快去吧

1279
01:45:32,295 --> 01:45:34,331
Master Wayne! Master Wayne!
但願你不是消防隊的

1280
01:45:38,655 --> 01:45:42,853
What is the point of all those pushups if you can't even lift a bloody log?
韋恩少爺！韋恩少爺！

1281
01:45:55,135 --> 01:45:56,250
[PLAYING PIANO]
你平時做的俯臥撐都白做了 連塊木頭都搬不動

1282
01:46:19,736 --> 01:46:21,727
BRUCE: What have I done, Alfred?
[鋼琴聲]

1283
01:46:22,696 --> 01:46:24,573
Everything my family...
布魯斯:我都干了些什麼呀？艾爾弗雷德

1284
01:46:24,573 --> 01:46:26,567
...my father, built...
我家的一切...

1285
01:46:28,856 --> 01:46:32,610
The Wayne legacy is more than bricks and mortar, sir.
...我父親親手建造的....

1286
01:46:32,610 --> 01:46:34,926
I wanted to save Gotham.
韋恩家族的遺產不僅僅是磚瓦 少爺

1287
01:46:35,736 --> 01:46:37,533
I failed.
我隻想拯救哥特城

1288
01:46:38,696 --> 01:46:39,924
Why do we fall, sir?
但我失敗了

1289
01:46:42,976 --> 01:46:46,332
So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.
為什麼說失敗 少爺？

1290
01:46:48,696 --> 01:46:50,766
You still haven't given up on me?
我們學會了“哪裡摔倒哪裡爬起來”

1291
01:46:52,576 --> 01:46:54,009
Never.
你還沒對我失去信心？

1292
01:46:55,016 --> 01:46:56,290
GORDON: Down!
永遠不會

1293
01:46:56,290 --> 01:46:59,254
MAN: Harassment! I see harassment!
戈登:給我下來

1294
01:46:59,254 --> 01:47:01,407
Maybe you'd like to see some excessive force?
強制執法 我是目擊證人

1295
01:47:01,407 --> 01:47:03,407
Madman with a gun.
也許你還想見識見識暴力執法吧

1296
01:47:04,416 --> 01:47:06,054
WOMAN [ON TV]: With residents furious...
拿槍就了不起呀

1297
01:47:06,054 --> 01:47:09,253
...at the unprecedented show of police strength to round up the inmates...
[電視報道]: 民眾對大量警察圍堵...

1298
01:47:09,253 --> 01:47:11,168
We're about to raise these bridges.
...精神病院病人的行為感到異常憤怒....

1299
01:47:11,168 --> 01:47:14,806
Officer, I am a Gotham City district attorney. Let me pass.
吊橋馬上起要起吊了

1300
01:47:21,896 --> 01:47:24,091
- Just shut up! - Hey, Flass, cool it!
警官 我是檢察院的 讓我過去吧

1301
01:47:24,091 --> 01:47:25,689

02:02:13,185 --> 02:02:14,777
No. This...
蝙蝠俠隻是一個象征, 雷切爾.

1433
02:02:15,905 --> 02:02:17,543
...is your mask.
不 那是...

1434
02:02:19,425 --> 02:02:22,815
Your real face is the one that criminals now fear.
...是你的面具

1435
02:02:23,625 --> 02:02:25,536
The man I loved...
現在罪犯們懼怕的是真正的你

1436
02:02:26,225 --> 02:02:27,624
...the man who vanished...
我以前所愛的...

1437
02:02:28,785 --> 02:02:30,855
...he never came back at all.
...那個失蹤的你...

1438
02:02:35,145 --> 02:02:37,705
But maybe he's still out there somewhere.
...根本就沒有再回來

1439
02:02:39,785 --> 02:02:43,334
Maybe someday, when Gotham no longer needs Batman...
也許他就在外面某個地方

1440
02:02:44,345 --> 02:02:46,222
...I'll see him again.
也許有那麼一天 當哥特城不再需要蝙蝠俠的時候...

1441
02:02:56,826 --> 02:02:59,624
- Proved me wrong, you know. - About what?
...我又能再見到他

1442
02:03:02,346 --> 02:03:04,701
Your father would be very proud of you.
-我承認我以前錯了 -關於什麼?

1443
02:03:04,906 --> 02:03:06,464
Just like me.
我是說你的父親一定會為你感到自豪

1444
02:03:32,346 --> 02:03:34,143
RACHEL: What will you do?
就像我一樣感到自豪

1445
02:03:35,466 --> 02:03:36,979
Rebuild it.
雷切爾:你打算將來怎麼辦?

1446
02:03:37,826 --> 02:03:40,101
Just the way it was, brick for brick.
重建庄園

1447
02:03:46,666 --> 02:03:47,860
Just the way it was, sir?
恢復它從前的一磚一瓦

1448
02:03:49,866 --> 02:03:51,060
Yeah, why?
和從前的一模一樣?

1449
02:03:51,060 --> 02:03:53,945
I thought this might be a good opportunity for...
你是什麼意思?

1450
02:03:53,945 --> 02:03:56,461
...improving the foundations.
我是說這是個難得的機會...

1451
02:03:56,461 --> 02:03:59,459
- In the southeast corner? - Precisely, sir.
...應該重新完善一下地基

1452
02:04:14,506 --> 02:04:17,259
- Nice. - I couldn't find any mob bosses.
-你是說東南角？ -對極啦

1453
02:04:18,186 --> 02:04:20,780
BATMAN: Well, sergeant? - It's "lieutenant" now.
-怎麼樣？ -我連一個黑幫老大都見不到

1454
02:04:21,106 --> 02:04:22,539
You really started something.
蝙蝠俠:是嗎？上校 -現在是“中校”了

1455
02:04:22,539 --> 02:04:24,617
Bent cops running scared.
你干的真不錯

1456
02:04:24,617 --> 02:04:26,139
Hope on the streets.
壞警察都聞風喪膽了

1457
02:04:26,386 --> 02:04:29,856
- But? - The Narrows is lost.
街道上也充滿了希望

1458
02:04:30,346 --> 02:04:34,056
And we still haven't picked up Crane or half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.
-還有呢？ -不過窄島完了

1459
02:04:34,707 --> 02:04:36,265
We will.
我們還沒有抓到克蘭 還有被他釋放的一大半其他病人

1460
02:04:36,467 --> 02:04:38,059
We can bring Gotham back.
會抓住他們的

1461
02:04:38,059 --> 02:04:40,616
- What about escalation? - Escalation?
我要重建哥特城

1462
02:04:40,616 --> 02:04:44,939
We start carrying semiautomatics, they buy automatics.
-犯罪率增加怎麼辦？ -增加？

1463
02:04:44,939 --> 02:04:49,259
We start wearing Kevlar, they buy armor-piercing rounds.
我們開始用半自動武器時 罪犯們已經用上全自動的了

1464
02:04:49,259 --> 02:04:52,578
- And? - And you're wearing a mask...
而當我們開始穿上防彈服的時候 他們卻用起了金屬爆裂子彈

1465
02:04:52,987 --> 02:04:54,784
...and jumping off rooftops.
-還有嗎？ -還有當你帶著面具...

1466
02:04:56,147 --> 02:04:58,103
Now, take this guy.
...從屋頂上跳下來的時候

1467
02:04:58,347 --> 02:05:00,303
Armed robbery, double homicide.
琢磨琢磨這家伙

1468
02:05:00,303 --> 02:05:03,584
Got a taste for the theatrical, like you.
持槍搶劫犯 雙料殺人犯

1469
02:05:03,827 --> 02:05:05,704
Leaves a calling card.
喜歡戲劇性 跟你一樣

1470
02:05:11,347 --> 02:05:13,099
I'll look into it.
留下一張牌

1471
02:05:16,427 --> 02:05:17,826
I never said thank you.
這件事交給我吧

1472
02:05:22,707 --> 02:05:24,698
And you'll never have to.
我從未謝過你

1473
02:10:44,027 --> 02:10:46,101
沒有這個必要
