-1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000

1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,351
瑞秋, 让我看看
Rachel, let me see.

2
00:00:57,392 --> 00:01:00,520
-我能看吗? -谁找到就是谁的, 找到它的人是我
-Can l see? -Finders keepers. And l found it.

3
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:02,219
这是我的花园
ln my garden.

4
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:05,762
谁找到就是谁的
Finders keepers.

5
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,230
布鲁斯？
Bruce?

6
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:20,976
布鲁斯？
Bruce?

7
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:25,752
妈妈！阿福！
Mom! Mr. Alfred!

8
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,871
你是不是又做梦了？
Did you have dream?

9
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,209
噩梦
Nightmare.

10
00:01:57,585 --> 00:01:59,052
比这地方还糟？
Worse than this place?

11
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:23,009
他们又要跟你打
They are going to fight you.

12
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:25,038
-又打? -直到把你杀了
-Again? -Until they kill you.

13
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:29,045
他们能在早餐前杀了我不？
Can they kill me before breakfast?

14
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:34,252
小家伙，这里是你的地狱
You are in hell, little man.

15
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:40,323
我就是魔王
And l am the devil.

16
00:02:43,698 --> 00:02:45,165
你不是魔王
You're not the devil.

17
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,698
只是我的沙包
You're practice.

18
00:03:30,178 --> 00:03:31,475
关禁闭!
Solitary.

19
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:33,546
-为什么? -为安全着想
-Why? -For protection.

20
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:37,580
-我现在很安全 -他们的安全
-l don't need protection. -Protection for them.

21
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:42,245
进去
Get in.

22
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:48,286
你如此渴望打击罪犯...
Are you so desperate to fight criminals...

23
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:51,090
以至于要把自己关起来，好一次对付他们全部？
...that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time?

24
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:56,267
实际上他们有七个人
Actually, there were seven of them.

25
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:58,735
我数的是六个，韦恩先生
l counted six, Mr. Wayne.

26
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,738
你怎么知道我名字？
How do you know my name?

27
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,971
不管他遁世多深
The world is too small for someone like Bruce Wayne to disappear...

28
00:04:07,148 --> 00:04:09,480
对韦恩这个人尽皆知的人来说, 要消失在这个世界都太难了
...no matter how deep he chooses to sink.

29
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:10,775
你是谁？
Who are you?

30
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:14,115
就叫我杜卡吧, 不过我为忍者大师效力
My name is merely Ducard, but l speak for Ra's al Ghul...

31
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:17,917
忍者大师的威名令所有罪犯胆寒
...a man greatly feared by the criminal underworld.

32
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,684
他能给你指引道路
A man who can offer you a path.

33
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:23,086
你怎么知道我需要指引？
What makes you think l need a path?

34
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:26,091
你这样的人跑来这里只能是出于自愿
Someone like you is only here by choice.

35
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,633
你一直在跟罪犯们称兄道弟...
You have been exploring the criminal fraternity...

36
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:31,271
不管你最初的目的是什么
...but whatever your original intentions...

37
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:35,339
你现在已经完全失去了自我
...you have become truly lost.

38
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:40,644
那么忍者大师能给我指引什么样的路？
And what path can Ra's al Ghul offer?

39
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:44,808
一个愿意分享他对罪恶的仇恨
The path of a man who shares his hatred of evil...

40
00:04:44,986 --> 00:04:48,217
和愿意伸张正义的人所走的路
...and wishes to serve true justice.

41
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,781
影武者联盟的路
The path of the League of Shadows.

42
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:56,159
-你们是绿林大盗 -不不不
-You're vigilantes. -No, no, no.

43
00:04:56,329 --> 00:05:00,527
绿林大盗指的是为了满足一己私欲而沉迷於纷争的人
A vigilante is just a man lost in the scramble for his own gratification.

44
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,363
他可以被关起来，也可以被毁灭
He can be destroyed or locked up.

45
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:10,542
但如果你能做到让自己超越于常人的存在
But if you make yourself more than just a man...

46
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,679
努力让自己成为一种理念
...if you devote yourself to an ideal...

47
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:16,339
并且让人无法阻止你做任何事
...and if they can't stop you...

48
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:19,185
你就能完全变成另一种东西
...then you become something else entirely.

49
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:22,412
什么东西？
Which is?

50
00:05:22,924 --> 00:05:25,893
传奇，韦恩先生
Legend, Mr. Wayne.

51
00:05:27,228 --> 00:05:28,820
明天你将被释放
Tomorrow, you will be released.

52
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,396
如果你对小偷小摸厌倦了，想干点大事的话
lf you are bored of brawling with thieves and want to achieve something...

53
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:36,024
在东边的山腰上有一种罕见的蓝色的花
...there is a rare blue flower that grows on the eastern slopes.

54
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:37,898
摘一朵
Pick one of these flowers.

55
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:41,041
如果你能把花带到山顶
lf you can carry it to the top of the mountain...

56
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,006
也许你就能找到最初寻找的东西
...you may find what you were looking for in the first place.

57
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:47,011
我最初寻找的是什么？
And what was l looking for?

58
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:50,683
只有你自己知道
Only you can know that.

59
00:06:57,852 --> 00:07:01,447
你得回头, 往回走
You turn back. You go back.

60
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:11,084
忍者大师？
Ra's al Ghul?

61
00:08:21,302 --> 00:08:22,860
等等
Wait.

62
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:27,170
你在寻找什么？
What are you seeking?

63
00:08:28,109 --> 00:08:30,100
我寻找...
l seek...

64
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,909
伸张正义的方法
...the means to fight injustice.

65
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:36,374
把恐惧带给那些
To turn fear...

66
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,583
给别人带来恐惧的人
...against those who prey on the fearful.

67
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:04,335
要操纵别人的恐惧
To manipulate the fears in others...

68
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:08,615
你首先就得控制好自己的恐惧
...you must first master your own.

69
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,947
准备好开始了？
Are you ready to begin?

70
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:14,412
我都...我都快站不起来了
l can.... l can barely stand.

71
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,954
死亡可不会让你好好准备！
Death does not wait for you to be ready!

72
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:20,252
死亡可没那么周到和公平！
Death is not considerate or fair!

73
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:25,390
别出差错，你现在面对着死亡
And make no mistake, here you face death.

74
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,635
虎拳
Tiger.

75
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,036
柔道
Jujitsu.

76
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,301
豹掌
Panther.

77
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,112
你有两下子，但这可不是跳舞！
You're skilled. But this is not a dance.

78
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,147
你在害怕
And you are afraid.

79
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,958
但不是怕我
But not of me.

80
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,923
告诉我们，韦恩先生
Tell us, Mr. Wayne...

81
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,602
你怕的是什么？
...what do you fear?

82
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,184
布鲁斯？
Bruce?

83
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,313
没事了, 没事了
lt's okay. lt's okay.

84
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:25,981
你不会有事的
You'll be okay.

85
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,558
韦恩老爷，要叫救护车吗？
Will we be needing an ambulance, Master Wayne?

86
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:31,721
不用，我给他接骨，然后拍张X光
No, l'll set the bone and take him for an x-ray later.

87
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,127
好的，老爷
Very good, sir.

88
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:37,298
-很抱歉，先生 -不用担心，没事的
-l'm very sorry, sir. l've told-- -Don't worry. lt's fine.

89
00:10:39,607 --> 00:10:41,575
摔了好大一跤，对不对，韦恩少爷？
Took quite a fall, didn't we, Master Bruce?

90
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:43,039
为什么我们会摔跤，布鲁斯？
And why do we fall, Bruce?

91
00:10:43,344 --> 00:10:46,438
好让我们能学着站起来
So we can learn to pick ourselves up.

92
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:53,084
轻轻摔了一下，小小骨折
Just a little fall. lt's just a small fracture.

93
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:03,859
又是蝙蝠？
The bats again?

94
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,160
你知道它们为什么攻击你不？
You know why they attacked you, don't you?

95
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,729
-它们害怕你 -害怕我?
-They were afraid of you. -Afraid of me?

96
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,874
所有的生物都会害怕
All creatures feel fear.

97
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,406
包括那些可怕的生物？
Even the scary ones?

98
00:11:16,577 --> 00:11:18,442
尤其是那些可怕的生物
Especially the scary ones.

99
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,609
我给你看样东西
l got something to show you.

100
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:28,217
-你觉得妈妈会喜欢不？ -会
-You think your mother will like them? -Yeah.

101
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,084
-该起床了 -也许吧
-l think it's time to get up. -Maybe.

102
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:32,850
别睡懒觉
No going back to bed.

103
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:38,189
爸爸，这电车是你造的吗？
Did you build this train, Dad?

104
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:43,064
歌谭市对我们有恩，但这个城市正在遭受苦难
Gotham's been good to our family, but the city's been suffering.

105
00:11:43,237 --> 00:11:46,764
穷人们生活艰难
People less fortunate than us have been enduring very hard times.

106
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,876
所以我们修建了新的，经济的公共交通系统，连接整个城市
So we built a new, cheap, public transportation system to unite the city.

107
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:52,740
而在中心就是
And at the center...

108
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:54,744
韦恩大厦
...Wayne Tower.

109
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:57,816
-你在那儿工作? -不，我在医院上班
-ls that where you work? -No, l work at the hospital.

110
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:01,181
我把公司交给更好的人打理
l leave the running of our company to much better men.

111
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,219
-更好的? -恩...
-Better? -Well...

112
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,654
对商道更感兴趣的人
...more interested men.

113
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:03,448
我们能走了吗?
Can we go?

114
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:07,309
求你了
Please.

115
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,946
行，咱们走
Okay. Let's go.

116
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:22,066
-怎么了，布鲁斯? -不不，是我的问题
-What's wrong, Bruce? -No, no. lt was me.

117
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:24,329
我需要点新鲜空气
l just needed some fresh air.

118
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:27,702
没想到小小的歌剧要演这么长时间，对吧，布鲁斯？
A little bit of opera goes a long way. Right, Bruce?

119
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,040
好，走吧
Come on. Let's go.

120
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,248
钱包，珠宝，快点！
Wallets, jewelry. Come on, fast.

121
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:41,786
-别激动 -快点
-That's fine. -Fast.

122
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,513
别激动
Take it easy.

123
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:45,748
别激动
Take it easy.

124
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:47,994
拿去吧
Here you go.

125
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:53,597
没事的, 没事的
lt's fine. lt's fine.

126
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:57,596
拿了就走吧
Now just take it and go.

127
00:13:57,771 --> 00:13:59,568
-我说了，珠宝
-l said, jewelry. -Hey--

128
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:02,939
托马斯！
Thomas!

129
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,543
布鲁斯
Bruce.

130
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:16,588
没事的
lt's okay.

131
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,455
不要害怕
Don't be afraid.

132
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,056
这是你父亲的？
ls this your father's?

133
00:14:56,597 --> 00:14:58,724
没事的
lt's okay.

134
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,560
来这边
Come here.

135
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,499
穿上
There you go.

136
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,635
没事了
lt's okay.

137
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,280
没事了
lt's okay.

138
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:20,776
戈登
Gordon.

139
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:30,454
 
Hey.

140
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:32,326
好消息
Good news.

141
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,667
我们抓到他了，孩子
We got him, son.

142
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,283
不要担心
You're in excellent hands.

143
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:00,022
我们帮你照料公司
We'll be watching the empire.

144
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:03,185
等你长大了，集团就是你的
When you grow up, it'll be waiting for you.

145
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:22,306
是不是要准备点晚餐
l thought l might prepare a little supper.

146
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,546
-好吧 -阿福？
-Very well. -Alfred?

147
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:35,552
-在，布鲁斯少爷? -是我的错，阿福
-Yes, Master Bruce? -lt was my fault, Alfred.

148
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:37,390
-是我让他们离开剧院的 -不
-l made them leave the theater. -No.

149
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:40,590
-如果不是因为我害怕 -完全不是你的错
-lf l hadn't gotten scared.... -lt was nothing that you did.

150
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:45,068
是凶手一个人的错
lt was him, and him alone.

151
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:47,039
明白吗？
Do you understand?

152
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:53,237
我想念他们，阿福，我好想他们
l miss them, Alfred. l miss them so much.

153
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:55,381
我也是，韦恩少爷
So do l, Master Bruce.

154
00:16:57,818 --> 00:16:59,046
我也是
So do l.

155
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:04,157
你还认为父母的死是你的错？
And do you still feel responsible for your parents' death?

156
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:06,451
我的愤怒甚于内疚
My anger outweighs my guilt.

157
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,593
来
Come.

158
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:15,962
你学会了用愤怒隐藏内疚
You have learned to bury your guilt with anger.

159
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:19,162
我要教你如何面对它，面对真相
l will teach you to confront it and to face the truth.

160
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:26,635
你可以对付六个人，我现在教你对付六百人
You know how to fight six men. We can teach you how to engage 600.

161
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:32,113
你学会了消失，我现在教你如何能真正隐身
You know how to disappear. We can teach you to become truly invisible.

162
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:35,482
隐身?
lnvisible?

163
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,213
 


164
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:44,123
一个忍者要明白隐身靠的是耐心和敏捷
The ninja understands that invisibility is a matter of patience and agility.

165
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,806
耳听六路，眼观八方
Always mind your surroundings.

166
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:04,177
忍术需要黑火药
Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.

167
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,915
-做武器? -或者障眼法
-As weapons? -Or distractions.

168
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,420
诡计和戏剧效果是很有威力的武器
Theatricality and deception are powerful agents.

169
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:13,917
在对手的眼里 你不止要简单的成为一个人
You must become more than just a man in the mind of your opponent.

170
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:18,356
-他是谁? -一个农民
-Who is he? -He was a farmer.

171
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:21,763
为了抢夺邻居的土地，他成了杀人犯
Then he tried to take his neighbor's land and became a murderer.

172
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,233
-现在他被关起来了 -他会有什么命运？
-Now he is a prisoner. -What'll happen to him?

173
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:26,838
正义的审判, 犯罪是不能被容忍的
Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated.

174
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:30,943
社会一旦放任 犯罪就会猖獗
Criminals thrive on the indulgence of society's understanding.

175
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:37,814
你父母的死不是你的错
Your parents' death was not your fault.

176
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:47,421
是你父亲的错
lt was your father's.

177
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:11,148
愤怒不能改变你父亲没有反抗的事实
Anger does not change the fact that your father failed to act.

178
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:13,513
-那个人有枪 -这会阻止你吗?
-The man had a gun. -Would that stop you?

179
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,549
我受过训练
l've had training.

180
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:17,553
训练不是关键！
The training is nothing!

181
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:19,385
意志才是一切！
Will is everything!

182
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,996
反抗的意志！
The will to act.

183
00:19:36,777 --> 00:19:38,005
投降吧
Yield.

184
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:39,710
你没有打赢我
You haven't beaten me.

185
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,610
为了击倒敌人 你牺牲了重心
You have sacrificed sure footing for a killing stroke.

186
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:52,020
摩擦你的胸膛
Rub your chest.

187
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:55,393
双手会让你变暖和
Your arms will take care of themselves.

188
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,690
你比你父亲要强大
You are stronger than your father.

189
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:01,994
你不了解我父亲
You didn't know my father.

190
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:04,467
但我知道是什么让你满腔怒火
But l know the rage that drives you.

191
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:09,666
难以忍受的愤怒遏制了你的悲伤，直到你对所爱的人的记忆
That impossible anger strangling the grief, until the memory of your loved one is just...

192
00:20:09,843 --> 00:20:11,902
成为你心中的毒瘤
...poison in your veins.

193
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:16,537
有一天，你会发觉自己希望你所爱的人根本从来不存在过
And one day, you catch yourself wishing the person you loved had never existed...

194
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:20,418
这样才能减轻内心的痛苦
...so you'd be spared your pain.

195
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:26,823
我并不是一直住在这山里的
l wasn't always here in the mountains.

196
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:30,487
曾经，我有一个妻子
Once, l had a wife.

197
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:33,365
我至生所爱
My great love.

198
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:36,661
她被害了
She was taken from me.

199
00:20:36,837 --> 00:20:40,034
像你一样，我不得不明白这个世界上存在着罪恶
Like you, l was forced to learn there are those without decency...

200
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:43,506
需要我们毫不犹豫，毫不留情的去打击
...who must be fought without hesitation, without pity.

201
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:47,644
你的愤怒赐予你强大的力量
Your anger gives you great power.

202
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:51,675
但如果放任不管，它会毁掉你
But if you let it, it will destroy you...

203
00:20:52,219 --> 00:20:53,447
...正如它差点毁掉我
...as it almost did me.

204
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,111
-是什么救了你? -复仇
-What stopped it? -Vengeance.

205
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,124
那对我没用
That's no help to me.

206
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:01,157
为什么，布鲁斯?
Why, Bruce?

207
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:03,990
为什么你不能为父母报仇?
Why could you not avenge your parents?

208
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:11,259
少爷，你是打算听证会后返回普林斯顿大学
Will you be heading back to Princeton after the hearing, sir...

209
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:14,100
还是听我的建议在这里逗留一两天？
...or can l persuade you to stay on for a day or two?

210
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:16,504
我不回去了
l'm not heading back at all.

211
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,700
-你不喜欢那里? -我喜欢
-You don't like it there? -l like it fine.

212
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,910
只是他们不喜欢我
They just don't feel the same way.

213
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:26,379
-我给你准备好了主卧室 -不
-l've prepared the master bedroom. -No.

214
00:21:26,553 --> 00:21:27,952
我住自己的房间就行
My room will be fine.

215
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,646
恕我直言，少爷，韦恩府邸就是你的家
With all due respect, sir, Wayne Manor is your house.

216
00:21:30,824 --> 00:21:32,689
不，阿福，只是我父亲的家
No, Alfred, it's my father's house.

217
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:35,225
-你父亲过世了 -这地方是个坟墓
-Your father is dead. -This place is a mausoleum.

218
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:38,421
如果可以，我会一砖一瓦把这地方拆干净
lf l have my way, l'll pull the damn thing down brick by brick.

219
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:42,694
韦恩少爷，这所宅子是你家族世世代代的家
This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered six generations of your family.

220
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:45,565
你为什么这么关心，阿福？又不是你的家
Why do you give a damn, Alfred? lt's not your family.

221
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:50,274
我关心是因为
l give a damn because a good man once made me responsible...

222
00:21:50,944 --> 00:21:53,105
曾经有个好人，托我帮他照顾
...for what was most precious to him...

223
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,510
他遗留于世上的，他最珍惜的人
...in the whole world.

224
00:21:57,484 --> 00:22:01,011
道斯小姐会载你去听证会
Miss Dawes has offered to drive you to the hearing.

225
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:03,246
她可能会劝你不要去
She probably hopes to talk you out of going.

226
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:06,859
阿福，我应该把我的过去和这场听证会一起埋葬吗？
Should l just bury the past out there with my parents, Alfred?

227
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:10,121
少爷，我没资格告诉你如何处理你的过去
l wouldn't presume to tell you what to do with your past, sir.

228
00:22:10,297 --> 00:22:14,324
但我了解，有很多人想知道你会如何处理你的将来
Just know that there are those of us who care about what you do with your future.

229
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:17,226
还是没有放弃我是吗？
Haven't given up on me yet?

230
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:19,394
从来没有
Never.

231
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:11,355
阿福还一直把炼奶放到架子顶上
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk on the top shelf.

232
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:15,985
他没意识到你已经长高了. 看来是旧习难改
Hasn't he noticed you're tall enough to reach now? Old habits die hard, l guess.

233
00:23:15,996 --> 00:23:18,556
-小时候也没能阻止我们去拿 -是啊
-Never used to stop us anyway. -No, it didn't.

234
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:20,632
你母亲怎么样?
How's your mom?

235
00:23:21,034 --> 00:23:23,264
她很想念这里
She misses this place.

236
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:26,295
我也是
So do l.

237
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:27,933
恩
Yeah.

238
00:23:28,108 --> 00:23:31,100
可惜物是人非
But it's nothing without the people who made it what it was.

239
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:34,303
-阿福还在 -还有你
-Now there's only Alfred. -And you.

240
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:38,008
-我不会久留 -你只是回来参加听证会
-l'm not staying, Rachel. -You're just back for the hearing.

241
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:45,819
布鲁斯, 是不是没有办法阻止你去听证会
Bruce, l don't suppose there's any way to convince you not to come.

242
00:23:46,126 --> 00:23:49,618
在这过程里
Someone at this proceeding...

243
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,457
总得有人去代表我的父母
...should stand for my parents.

244
00:23:52,632 --> 00:23:54,759
我们都爱你的父母
We all loved your parents, Bruce.

245
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:58,165
-凶手吉尔做的事不可饶恕 -那为什么你的上级要放了他
-What Chill did is unforgivable. -Then why is your boss letting him go?

246
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:02,770
在牢里, 他跟恶棍头目法康尼同住一个牢房
ln prison, he shared a cell with Carmine Falcone.

247
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:06,605
他知道些内幕, 并愿意以早释为条件, 举报法康尼
He learned things, and he will testify in exchange for early parole.

248
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,442
瑞秋, 凶手杀了我父母
Rachel, this man killed my parents.

249
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:13,180
我不能忘掉这个
l cannot let that pass.

250
00:24:13,353 --> 00:24:16,220
我也请你理解
And l need you to understand that, please.

251
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,185
我理解
Okay.

252
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,593
大萧条让工薪阶层遭受重创, 吉尔先生, 是个典型例子
The depression hit working people, like Mr. Chill, hardest of all.

253
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:28,962
他所犯之罪不可饶恕,但他是由绝望所驱使, 而非贪婪
His crime was appalling, yes, but it was motivated not by greed, but by desperation.

254
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:32,070
经过14年积极的服刑
Given the 1 4 years served, as well as his extraordinary level of cooperation...

255
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:35,769
根据我们这里最重要一位检察官的调查结果
...with one of this office's most important investigations...

256
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:39,140
我们强烈建议批准他的早释申请
...we strongly endorse his petition for early release.

257
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,444
吉尔先生?
Mr. Chill?

258
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,678
法官大人
Your Honor...

259
00:24:48,588 --> 00:24:51,716
我没有一天不为自己的行为后悔
...not a day goes by that l don't wish l could take back what l did.

260
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,591
诚然, 和很多人一样我当时很绝望
Sure, l was desperate, like a lot of people back then...

261
00:24:57,764 --> 00:25:00,096
但这不能减轻我的所作所为
...but that don't change what l did.

262
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:08,401
我了解今天有位韦恩家族的成员在场
l gather there is a member of the Wayne family here today.

263
00:25:08,575 --> 00:25:10,839
他有什么要说吗?
Has he got anything to say?

264
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:28,425
-他出来了! -他出来了!
-He's coming out the side! -He's coming out the side, guys!

265
00:25:38,104 --> 00:25:39,401
布鲁斯`韦恩也在!
Bruce Wayne!

266
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,436
吉尔!
Joe! Hey, Joe!

267
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,077
法康尼向你问好!
Falcone says hi.

268
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:57,013
走吧
Come on, Bruce.

269
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,016
我们不要看这些
We don't need to see this.

270
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,317
我要看
l do.

271
00:26:06,466 --> 00:26:10,459
检察院不明白为什么法官一定要举行公开听证会
The DA couldn't understand why Judge Faden insisted on making the hearing public.

272
00:26:10,637 --> 00:26:13,037
法康尼收买了他,好让吉尔能公开露面
Falcone paid him off to get Chill out in the open.

273
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,501
也许我应该感谢他
Maybe l should thank them.

274
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:17,233
-你不是认真的 -如果我是呢,瑞秋?
-You don't mean that. -What if l do, Rachel?

275
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,343
我父母应该得到一个公正的结果
My parents deserved justice.

276
00:26:19,512 --> 00:26:22,413
你说的不是公正, 只是复仇
You're not talking about justice. You're talking about revenge.

277
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:25,483
-有时候两者是一样意思 -不,从来不一样
-Sometimes, they're the same. -No, they're never the same.

278
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:29,213
公正会带来和谐,复仇只是逞一己之快
Justice is about harmony. Revenge is about you making yourself feel better.

279
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:32,688
-正因如此我们才会有司法系统 -你们的系统早已崩溃
-Which is why we have an impartial system. -Your system is broken.

280
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:42,599
你如果关心公正, 就不要总局限于自己的痛苦
You care about justice? Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.

281
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:44,503
这座城市正在腐烂
This city is rotting.

282
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:47,435
人们觉得大萧条已经成历史, 其实没有
They talk about the depression as if it's history. lt's not.

283
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:49,097
世道比以前更糟
Things are worse than ever here.

284
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,835
法康尼让城市充满犯罪与邪恶
Falcone floods our streets with crime and drugs...

285
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:54,946
到处是绝望, 每天都产生新的吉尔
...preying on the desperate, creating new Joe Chills every day.

286
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,639
法康尼也许没有杀了你父母
Falcone may not have killed your parents, Bruce...

287
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,775
但他在摧毁你父母所代表的一切
...but he's destroying everything that they stood for.

288
00:27:05,325 --> 00:27:08,226
你想感谢他? 去吧
You wanna thank him for that? Here you go.

289
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:11,461
我们都知道他在哪里
We all know where to find him.

290
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:14,998
只要他继续助纣为虐, 就没人敢动他
As long as he keeps the bad people rich and the good people scared, no one'll touch him.

291
00:27:15,435 --> 00:27:19,599
像你父母一样代表正义的好人, 已经一去不返
Good people like your parents, who'll stand against injustice, they're gone.

292
00:27:19,772 --> 00:27:22,673
当好人尽去, 这个城市还有什么希望?
What chance does Gotham have when the good people do nothing?

293
00:27:24,611 --> 00:27:28,047
-我不是你所说的好人, 瑞秋 -你什么意思?
-l'm not one of your good people, Rachel. -What do you mean?

294
00:27:30,283 --> 00:27:35,782
这些年来我一直想杀了他, 现在杀不了了
All these years, l wanted to kill him. Now l can't.

295
00:27:51,604 --> 00:27:53,265
你父亲会以你为耻
Your father would be ashamed of you.

296
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:39,274
韦恩先生, 你看起来比报纸上的照片要高
You're taller than you look in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.

297
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,583
没带枪? 简直是侮辱!
No gun? l'm insulted.

298
00:28:44,757 --> 00:28:48,625
-你大可写份感谢信就行 -我不是来这里谢你的
-You could've just sent a thank-you note. -l didn't come here to thank you.

299
00:28:48,795 --> 00:28:51,491
我是来这里告诉你 不是所有人都怕你
l came to show you that not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you.

300
00:28:51,664 --> 00:28:53,291
了解我的人才怕我 孩子
Only those who know me, kid.

301
00:28:53,633 --> 00:28:56,101
看看你周围, 这里有两位参议员
Look around you. You'll see two councilmen...

302
00:28:56,436 --> 00:28:59,269
一个联邦督察 两位当值警官
...a union official, couple off-duty cops...

303
00:28:59,706 --> 00:29:01,333
一个法官
...and a judge.

304
00:29:01,507 --> 00:29:05,773
我完全可以在他们面前一枪蹦了你
Now, l wouldn't have a second's hesitation of blowing your head off in front of them.

305
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:08,675
这样的力量你是买不到的
Now, that's power you can't buy.

306
00:29:09,315 --> 00:29:10,748
这是恐惧的力量
That's the power of fear.

307
00:29:11,184 --> 00:29:12,412
我不惧怕你
l'm not afraid of you.

308
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:14,485
因为你觉得自己已经了无牵挂
Because you think you got nothing to lose.

309
00:29:14,654 --> 00:29:16,281
但你还没考虑仔细
But you haven't thought it through.

310
00:29:16,456 --> 00:29:19,584
你还没考虑到你那在检察院上班的女朋友
You haven't thought about your lady friend in the DA's office.

311
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:22,193
你还没考虑到你的老管家
You haven't thought about your old butler.

312
00:29:26,332 --> 00:29:28,664
像你这样的人
People from your world...

313
00:29:28,835 --> 00:29:31,201
牵挂多的是
...have so much to lose.

314
00:29:31,371 --> 00:29:35,705
就因为你父母被害
Now, you think because your mommy and your daddy got shot...

315
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,844
你就认为自己尝到了人间疾苦, 扯蛋吧
...you know about the ugly side of life, but you don't.

316
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:41,104
你根本不知道什么是绝望
You've never tasted desperate.

317
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,840
你是布鲁斯`韦恩, 歌谭市天之骄子
You're.... You're Bruce Wayne, the prince of Gotham.

318
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:47,417
要想人们认不出你的大名, 你得远走他乡才行
You'd have to go 1 000 miles to meet someone who didn't know your name.

319
00:29:47,587 --> 00:29:51,887
所以不要怒气冲天的跑来这里, 试图证明什么
So don't come down here with your anger, trying to prove something to yourself.

320
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:54,150
这是一个你从来不会了解的世界
This is a world you'll never understand.

321
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:56,351
而你不了解的东西
And you always fear...

322
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:58,963
始终会让你恐惧
...what you don't understand.

323
00:30:01,868 --> 00:30:03,233
好了
All right.

324
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:13,710
我说, 你还挺有种
Yeah, you got spirit, kid. l'll give you that.

325
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,848
比你老子强
More than your old man anyway.

326
00:30:16,015 --> 00:30:20,315
在牢里, 吉尔跟我说了他杀你父母的当晚
ln the joint, Chill told me about the night he killed your parents.

327
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,716
他说你父亲求饶
He said your father begged for mercy.

328
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,819
求饶
Begged.

329
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,390
像条狗一样
Like a dog.

330
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:42,002
小费给少了?
Should've tipped better.

331
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,848
-你要什么? -你的外套
-For what? -Your jacket.

332
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,012
行
Okay.

333
00:30:57,123 --> 00:31:00,581
嘿, 给我吧, 这件大衣蛮帅
Hey, hey, hey. Let me have it. lt's a nice coat.

334
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,853
最好别让人看到你穿这件大衣
Be careful who sees you with that.

335
00:31:03,463 --> 00:31:05,363
-他们会来找我的 -谁?
-They're gonna come looking for me. -Who?

336
00:31:05,832 --> 00:31:07,527
所有人
Everyone.

337
00:31:09,836 --> 00:31:11,599
这件...
lt's....

338
00:31:11,771 --> 00:31:13,739
这件大衣蛮帅
lt's a nice coat.

339
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:36,426
当你和那些罪犯混在一起的时候, 有没有同情他们?
When you lived among the criminals, did you start to pity them?

340
00:31:36,596 --> 00:31:40,293
有, 当我第一次因为饥饿而盗窃的时候
The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes.

341
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:45,961
我分不清对和错的本质
I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong.

342
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,333
当我各处游荡
And when I traveled...

343
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:52,205
我尝到了犯罪前的恐慌
...I learned the fear before a crime...

344
00:31:52,979 --> 00:31:55,539
和得手後的激动
...and the thrill of success.

345
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,281
但我从来没成为他们中的一员
But I never became one of them.

346
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:01,685
他不想说他的名字


347
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:05,690
白痴, 谁会在乎你叫什么, 你只是个罪犯
Fool. What do l care what your name is? You're a criminal.

348
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:06,914
我不是犯人
I'm not a criminal

349
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:08,924
跟这些货的主人说去吧
Tell that to the guy who owned these.

350
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:10,585
 


351
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:16,090
你满世界游荡, 去了解犯罪者的心理, 去征服恐惧
You've traveled the world to understand the criminal mind and conquer your fears.

352
00:32:18,204 --> 00:32:22,300
但是犯罪其实并不复杂
But a criminal is not complicated.

353
00:32:22,475 --> 00:32:25,808
让你恐惧的是你的内心
And what you really fear is inside yourself.

354
00:32:25,978 --> 00:32:28,538
你害怕自己的力量
You fear your own power.

355
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:29,976
你害怕自己的愤怒
You fear your anger...

356
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:34,715
愤怒可以驱使你做伟大或者恐怖的事
...the drive to do great or terrible things.

357
00:32:34,887 --> 00:32:38,323
现在你必须审视内心
Now you must journey inwards.

358
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:44,187
准备好了
You are ready.

359
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:46,597
吸气
Breathe.

360
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:58,042
吸气
Breathe.

361
00:33:03,015 --> 00:33:04,880
呼吸你的恐惧
Breathe in your fears.

362
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,509
面对它们
Face them.

363
00:33:10,022 --> 00:33:12,820
为了征服恐惧, 你自己必须成为恐惧
To conquer fear, you must become fear.

364
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:16,393
你要在别人的恐惧中悠闲自得
You must bask in the fear of other men.

365
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:21,266
人最怕的是他们看不到的东西
And men fear most what they cannot see.

366
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:41,351
你要成为别人心里一种可怕的想法
You have to become a terrible thought.

367
00:33:45,925 --> 00:33:47,119
一个幽灵
A wraith.

368
00:33:52,832 --> 00:33:55,198
你要成为一种理念!
You have to become an idea!

369
00:34:02,074 --> 00:34:05,134
感受恐惧如何模糊你的感官
Feel terror cloud your senses.

370
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:10,076
感受他扭曲你心灵的力量
Feel its power to distort.

371
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,280
控制的力量
To control.

372
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:20,155
并要知道这样的力量可以为你所用
And know that this power can be yours.

373
00:34:32,705 --> 00:34:35,367
拥抱你最大的恐惧
Embrace your worst fear.

374
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:44,645
在黑暗中与它们成为一体
Become one with the darkness.

375
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:06,198
专注
Focus.

376
00:35:06,505 --> 00:35:08,666
集中
Concentrate.

377
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:10,934
锻炼你的感官
Master your senses.

378
00:35:39,038 --> 00:35:41,472
你不能留下痕迹
You cannot leave any sign.

379
00:35:41,841 --> 00:35:43,069
我可没有
l haven't.

380
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,341
不错
lmpressive.

381
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,557
我们已经驱散了你的恐惧
We have purged your fear.

382
00:36:05,698 --> 00:36:07,325
你已做好准备领导他们了
You are ready to lead these men.

383
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,027
你已准备好成为影武者联盟的一员了
You are ready to become a member of the League of Shadows.

384
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:17,836
但首先, 你必须证明你对伸张正义的决心
But first, you must demonstrate your commitment to justice.

385
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:35,958
不
No.

386
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:38,690
我不是刽子手
l'm no executioner.

387
00:36:39,265 --> 00:36:42,928
同情是个弱点, 你的敌人可不会怜悯
Your compassion is a weakness your enemies will not share.

388
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:45,566
这就是重要之所在
That's why it's so important.

389
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:47,567
是我们与他们不同之处
lt separates us from them.

390
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,140
你想打击犯罪, 这个人是个杀人犯
You want to fight criminals. This man is a murderer.

391
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:52,106
-他要受到审判 -被谁审判?
-This man should be tried. -By whom?

392
00:36:52,278 --> 00:36:53,973
腐败的官僚机构?
Corrupt bureaucrats?

393
00:36:54,146 --> 00:36:56,637
犯罪者蔑视社会法律
Criminals mock society's laws.

394
00:36:56,816 --> 00:36:59,114
你比谁都清楚这点
You know this better than most.

395
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:02,579
如果你没有做好准备去打击邪恶
You cannot lead these men...

396
00:37:02,755 --> 00:37:06,748
你就不能领导这些人
...unless you are prepared to do what is necessary to defeat evil.

397
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,793
我要领导他们去哪里?
And where would l be leading these men?

398
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:11,591
歌谭市
Gotham.

399
00:37:11,764 --> 00:37:13,823
做为歌谭的宠儿
As Gotham's favored son...

400
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:18,333
你是给予犯罪者致命一击的最理想人物
...you will be ideally placed to strike at the heart of criminality.

401
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:22,470
-怎么做? -歌谭大数已尽
-How? -Gotham's time has come.

402
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:25,974
像之前的君士坦丁堡和罗马
Like Constantinople or Rome before it...

403
00:37:26,145 --> 00:37:30,343
这个城市已成为滋生痛苦与不公的温床
...the city has become a breeding ground for suffering and injustice.

404
00:37:30,516 --> 00:37:34,111
已经无药可救, 必须灭亡
lt is beyond saving and must be allowed to die.

405
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:39,485
这是影武者联盟最重要的使命
This is the most important function of the League of Shadows.

406
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,851
是我们几百年来执行的任务
lt is one we've performed for centuries.

407
00:37:43,195 --> 00:37:44,924
歌谭市
Gotham...

408
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:47,998
必须灭亡!
...must be destroyed.

409
00:37:51,303 --> 00:37:52,827
你该不会信这些鬼话吧
You can't believe in this.

410
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:57,565
忍者大师把我们从内心中最黑暗的地方拯救出来
Ra's al Ghul rescued us from the darkest corners of our own hearts.

411
00:37:57,743 --> 00:38:02,146
他要求的回报只是行必行之事的勇气
What he asks in return is the courage to do what is necessary.

412
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:05,714
我会回歌谭, 去打击恶人
l will go back to Gotham and l will fight men like this...

413
00:38:05,885 --> 00:38:08,445
但我不会成为一个刽子手
...but l will not become an executioner.

414
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:10,179
布鲁斯, 醒醒吧
Bruce, please.

415
00:38:10,356 --> 00:38:13,189
看在你自己的份上, 已经没有回头路了
For your own sake, there is no turning back.

416
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:48,084
-你干什么? -行必行之事
-What are you doing? -What's necessary, my friend.

417
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:07,624
我会告诉他是你救他一命
l will tell him you saved his life.

418
00:41:26,385 --> 00:41:28,910
韦恩少爷, 你离开有段日子了
Master Wayne, you've been gone a long time.

419
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:31,352
-恩, 是的 -你看起来很时髦
-Yes, l have. -You look very fashionable.

420
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:34,358
除了有点风尘仆仆
Apart from the mud.

421
00:41:34,626 --> 00:41:37,288
你打算回歌谭多久, 少爷?
Are you coming back to Gotham for long, sir?

422
00:41:37,463 --> 00:41:38,691
越久越好
As long as it takes.

423
00:41:38,864 --> 00:41:40,354
我要告诉人们
l want to show the people...

424
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:43,968
他们的城市不属于罪犯和堕落者
...their city doesn't belong to the criminals and the corrupt.

425
00:41:44,136 --> 00:41:47,333
大萧条期间, 你父亲为了战胜贫困
ln the depression, your father nearly bankrupted Wayne Enterprises...

426
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:48,734
几乎倾家荡产
...combating poverty.

427
00:41:48,941 --> 00:41:53,435
他相信自己可以成为一个例子, 让富人们来拯救城市
He believed his example could inspire the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.

428
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:55,337
他成功了?
Did it?

429
00:41:56,482 --> 00:41:57,949
某种方式上是
ln a way.

430
00:41:58,117 --> 00:42:01,177
你父母的被害震惊了富人们, 他们已经不敢做事
Their murder shocked the wealthy and the powerful into action.

431
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:06,248
要驱散冷漠, 人们需要受到深刻教训
People need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy.

432
00:42:06,425 --> 00:42:08,086
做为布鲁斯`韦恩我办不到
l can't do that as Bruce Wayne.

433
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,784
做为一个人
As a man...

434
00:42:09,962 --> 00:42:12,362
我只是血肉之躯, 会被忽视, 被击毁
...l'm flesh and blood, l can be ignored, destroyed.

435
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:14,465
但做为一个象征
But as a symbol....

436
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:18,562
做为一个象征, 我可以变得战无不胜
As a symbol, l can be incorruptible.

437
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:21,364
-我可以变得不朽 -什么象征?
-l can be everlasting. -What symbol?

438
00:42:21,974 --> 00:42:24,636
某种本质的
Something elemental...

439
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,437
恐怖的象征
...something terrifying.

440
00:42:26,612 --> 00:42:28,705
我以为随着你和黑帮们的开战
l assume that as you take on the underworld...

441
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:34,012
这种象征只是为了以防你所关心之人被报复?
...this symbol is a persona to protect those you care about from reprisals?

442
00:42:34,186 --> 00:42:35,551
你说的是瑞秋?
You're thinking about Rachel?

443
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:38,087
实际上, 少爷, 我说的是自己
Actually, sir, l was thinking of myself.

444
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:41,854
你有跟谁说我回来了吗?
Have you told anyone l'm coming back?

445
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:46,258
跟人们说你起死回生, 这好像不合逻辑
l couldn't figure the legal ramifications of bringing you back from the dead.

446
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:48,331
-死? -你消失了7年
-Dead? -You've been gone seven years.

447
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,762
你跟人宣告说我死了?
You had me declared dead?

448
00:42:49,935 --> 00:42:52,836
实际上是厄尔先生说的, 他要让公司上市
Actually, it was Mr. Earle. He's taking the company public.

449
00:42:53,005 --> 00:42:55,269
他打算清掉你的大部分股权
He wanted to liquidate your majority shareholding.

450
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,772
这些股份可值不少钱
Those shares are worth quite a bit of money.

451
00:42:57,943 --> 00:43:00,673
那幸好我把所有东西都留给了你
Well, it's a good thing l left everything to you, then.

452
00:43:01,213 --> 00:43:02,942
当然, 少爷
Quite so, sir.

453
00:43:03,115 --> 00:43:06,744
你可以借我的罗伊斯去开, 记得加满油就行
And you can borrow the Rolls, if you like. Just bring it back with a full tank.

454
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:21,528
以我的意见, 当事人有可能伤害他人, 也有可能自残
ln my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much a danger to himself as to others...

455
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:26,462
所以监狱对于他的康复来说不是一个好环境
...and prison is probably not the best environment for his rehabilitation.

456
00:43:28,774 --> 00:43:31,368
-克莱恩博士 -道斯小姐
-Dr. Crane. -Miss Dawes.

457
00:43:31,543 --> 00:43:34,808
你觉得一个谋杀他人的暴徒不应该进监狱?
You think a man who butchers people for the mob doesn't belong in jail?

458
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,642
我可不想这样证明
l would hardly have testified to that otherwise, would l?

459
00:43:37,816 --> 00:43:40,910
这是第三个被你宣告精神有问题
This is the third of Falcone's thugs you've had declared insane...

460
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:42,484
并转送到你的精神病院的法康尼的手下
...and moved into your asylum.

461
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,350
看来有组织犯罪这样的"工种"对疯子有吸引力
Well, the work offered by organized crime must have an attraction to the insane.

462
00:43:48,894 --> 00:43:50,885
对堕落的人也有吸引力
Or the corrupt.

463
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:54,723
芬奇先生
Mr. Finch.

464
00:43:55,067 --> 00:43:56,864
你应该提醒道斯小姐
You should check with Miss Dawes here...

465
00:43:57,035 --> 00:44:01,404
你的部门是否该给予她权力说这样的话
...just what implications your office has authorized her to make. lf any.

466
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:07,708
-你干什么? -你干什么, 卡尔?
-What are you doing? -What are you doing, Carl?

467
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:09,244
我在罩着你
Looking out for you.

468
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:14,650
法康尼把半个城市的人都收买了
Falcone has half the city bought and paid for.

469
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,879
-别管了 -你怎么能这么说?
-Drop it. -How can you say that?

470
00:44:17,055 --> 00:44:20,752
比起抓住法康尼, 我更关心你
Because as much as l care about getting Falcone, l care more about you.

471
00:44:20,926 --> 00:44:22,223
你真好
That's sweet.

472
00:44:27,633 --> 00:44:29,999
我们已经谈过这些了
We've been through all that.

473
00:44:56,094 --> 00:44:57,527
又是蝙蝠, 少爷
Blessed bat again, sir.

474
00:44:57,996 --> 00:45:00,396
它们在地下某处筑巢
They nest somewhere in the grounds.

475
00:46:58,283 --> 00:47:00,979
不要再找我帮忙了, 已经引起怀疑了
No more favors. Someone is sniffing around.

476
00:47:01,153 --> 00:47:04,122
嘿, 我关照你, 你也要关照我
Hey, l scratch your back, you scratch mine, doc.

477
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:05,654
我把货运进来了
l'm bringing in the shipments.

478
00:47:06,357 --> 00:47:07,585
我们是付钱给你的
We are paying you for that.

479
00:47:07,759 --> 00:47:10,250
大概我对实际意义的帮忙比对钱更感兴趣
Maybe money isn't as interesting to me as favors.

480
00:47:12,764 --> 00:47:17,565
我很清楚你不会吃我这一套, 法康尼先生
l am more than aware that you are not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.

481
00:47:17,735 --> 00:47:20,795
但你知道我为谁工作, 一旦他抵达这里
But you know who l'm working for, and when he gets here--

482
00:47:20,972 --> 00:47:22,906
他, 他要来歌谭?
He-- He's coming to Gotham?

483
00:47:23,074 --> 00:47:24,507
对, 没错
Yes, he is.

484
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:27,144
一旦他抵达这里, 他可不想知道
And when he gets here, he's not going to wanna hear...

485
00:47:27,312 --> 00:47:32,409
你就为了救你那些小喽罗而威胁到他整个行动
...that you have endangered our operation just to get your thugs out of a little jail time.

486
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:36,751
-谁在找你们麻烦? -检察院里的一个女孩
-Who's bothering you? -There's a girl at the DA's office.

487
00:47:37,222 --> 00:47:39,019
-我们收买她 -这位估计不行
-We'll buy her off. -Not this one.

488
00:47:40,158 --> 00:47:42,058
哦, 理想主义者?
ldealist, huh?

489
00:47:42,227 --> 00:47:43,956
没事, 对付这种人我也有对策
Well, there's an answer to that too.

490
00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:47,298
-我可不想知道 -你当然想
-l don't want to know. -Yes, you do.

491
00:47:49,301 --> 00:47:51,292
 


492
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:54,906
不, 我们每个部门的发展都很健康
No, we are showing very healthy growth in these sectors.

493
00:47:55,073 --> 00:47:58,270
我觉得托马斯`韦恩不会乐意看到
l don't think Thomas Wayne would have viewed heavy-arms manufacture...

494
00:47:58,443 --> 00:48:00,570
将军火制造做为我们的主要业务
...as a suitable cornerstone for our business.

495
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:05,780
那是20年前了, 弗雷德里克
Well, that's 20 years ago, Fredericks.

496
00:48:06,084 --> 00:48:09,247
我觉得20年的时间
l think after 20 years we can allow ourselves...

497
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,287
足够长到让我们不要管托马斯怎么想的了
...to stop thinking about what Thomas Wayne would have done.

498
00:48:12,457 --> 00:48:14,322
早上好, 厄尔先生办公室
Good morning, Mr. Earle's office.

499
00:48:14,493 --> 00:48:17,792
对, 他要确认明晚的晚餐
Yes, he's confirmed for the dinner tomorrow evening.

500
00:48:17,963 --> 00:48:21,262
早上好, 我想找厄尔先生
Good morning. l'm here to see Mr. Earle.

501
00:48:21,432 --> 00:48:22,956
姓名?
Name?

502
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:25,062
布鲁斯`韦恩
Bruce Wayne.

503
00:48:26,938 --> 00:48:30,430
托马斯可能不会愿意让公司上市
Thomas would probably not have taken the company public.

504
00:48:30,609 --> 00:48:34,739
但做为有责任心的经理们, 我们必须这样做
But that is what we, as responsible managers, are going to do.

505
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:36,971
杰西卡?
Jessica?

506
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:40,574
杰西卡, 你去哪了?
Jessica? Where are you?

507
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:45,018
-眼睛看着球, 然后... -为什么没人回电话?
-Eye on the ball, and.... -Why is no one answering the phone?

508
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:48,853
这是韦恩企业, 先生, 我保证一会就回电
lt's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle. l'm sure they'll call back.

509
00:48:49,194 --> 00:48:51,685
布鲁斯? 你应该已经死了啊
Bruce? You're supposed to be dead.

510
00:48:51,863 --> 00:48:53,797
很抱歉让你失望
l'm sorry to disappoint.

511
00:48:53,965 --> 00:48:56,695
-你得看看这个 -你见过他了吗?
-l need you to take a look at this. -Have you seen him yet?

512
00:48:57,002 --> 00:48:58,526
-谁? -韦恩
-Who? -Wayne.

513
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:00,929
新闻里到处都是, 他回来了
lt's been all over the news. He's back.

514
00:49:04,876 --> 00:49:07,777
你一定也意识到庞大的生意是停不下来的
l'm sure you realize l can't stop the big machine.

515
00:49:07,946 --> 00:49:09,174
要照顾的地方很多
Too many wheels turning.

516
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,371
-我们要上市 -我明白
-We're going public. -l understand.

517
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:14,648
那我的那份股权也会大赚一笔了
And l'll be handsomely rewarded for my shares.

518
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:17,379
我无意插手生意
l'm not looking to interfere.

519
00:49:17,856 --> 00:49:19,949
-只是想找份工作 -哦?
-l am looking for a job. -Oh?

520
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:23,185
我就想了解下我父亲创下的企业
l just want to get to know the company that my family built.

521
00:49:23,495 --> 00:49:25,258
你想从哪里开始?
Any ideas where you would start?

522
00:49:25,763 --> 00:49:28,129
我想去应用科技部
Applied Sciences caught my eye.

523
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,229
福克斯的部门
Fox's department.

524
00:49:30,401 --> 00:49:32,392
我会通知他你要过去
l'll let him know you're coming.

525
00:49:33,305 --> 00:49:36,069
你看起来很像他 你父亲
You look like him. Your dad.

526
00:49:36,841 --> 00:49:39,537
你是韦恩家族唯一的成员了
You're the only one left of the Wayne family.

527
00:49:39,711 --> 00:49:43,670
这是你的家, 欢迎回来
This is where you belong. Welcome home.

528
00:49:43,949 --> 00:49:48,477
环保产品, 防务产品, 消费产品
Environmental procedures, defense projects, consumer products.

529
00:49:48,987 --> 00:49:51,717
全部都是原型, 任何级别的产品
All prototypes. None in production.

530
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:54,552
-都没有量产 -一个都没?
-On any level whatsoever. -None?

531
00:49:55,527 --> 00:49:57,392
他们是怎么跟你描述这个部门的?
What did they tell you this place was?

532
00:49:57,562 --> 00:49:59,587
什么都没跟我说
They didn't tell me anything.

533
00:50:02,033 --> 00:50:05,491
当我被调来这里的时候, 厄尔跟我可说得很清楚
Earle told me exactly what it was when he sent me down here.

534
00:50:05,971 --> 00:50:07,438
冷宫部门
Dead end.

535
00:50:07,606 --> 00:50:10,939
调我来是为了不让我再为董事会惹麻烦
Place to keep me from causing the board any more trouble.

536
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:13,366
来吧
Come on.

537
00:50:13,545 --> 00:50:16,013
-你以前是董事会的? -在你父亲的年代是
-You were on the board? -When your father ran things.

538
00:50:16,181 --> 00:50:18,081
-你认识我父亲? -当然
-You knew my father? -Oh, yeah.

539
00:50:18,249 --> 00:50:19,876
电车就是我帮他造的
Helped him build his train.

540
00:50:20,485 --> 00:50:22,112
看看这里
Here we are.

541
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,417
凯扶拉护甲
Kevlar utility harness.

542
00:50:27,792 --> 00:50:29,760
气动电磁攀岩枪
Gas-powered, magnetic grapple gun.

543
00:50:29,928 --> 00:50:32,226
350磅测试钢丝
The 350-pound test monofilament.

544
00:50:35,567 --> 00:50:37,762
你父亲的有轨电车, 是个伟大的计划
Wonderful project, your dad's train.

545
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:42,865
整合了水电管道, 一起通向韦恩大厦
Routed it right into Wayne Tower, along with the water and power utilities.

546
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:46,272
基本让韦恩大厦成了实际上的城市中心
Kind of made Wayne Tower the unofficial center of Gotham City.

547
00:50:46,478 --> 00:50:49,106
当然, 厄尔荒废了它, 看看这
Of course, Earle let it go to rot. Here we are.

548
00:50:50,982 --> 00:50:53,109
为士兵做的诺维克斯生存装束

549
00:50:53,318 --> 00:50:56,048
凯扶拉材料, 加强过的关节
Kevlar biweave, reinforced joints.

550
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:58,753
-抗撕裂吗? -这玩意能防刀子
-Tear-resistant? -This sucker will stop a knife.

551
00:50:58,923 --> 00:51:01,153
-子弹呢? -除非直射命中, 没问题
-Bulletproof? -Anything but a straight shot.

552
00:51:01,326 --> 00:51:02,759
为什么不量产?
-Why didn't they put it into production? -Bean counters didn't think a soldier's life...

553
00:51:03,061 --> 00:51:06,748
他们不认为一个士兵的生命, 值30万美元
...was worth 300 grand.

554
00:51:07,832 --> 00:51:11,268
那么韦恩先生, 你对它们有什么兴趣?
So, what's your interest in it, Mr. Wayne?

555
00:51:11,936 --> 00:51:13,460
我打算借用下
l want to borrow it.

556
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:15,401
洞穴探险用
For spelunking.

557
00:51:16,274 --> 00:51:17,571
洞穴探险?
Spelunking?

558
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:19,471
是啊, 就是那种洞穴攀岩
Yeah, you know, cave diving?

559
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:23,407
你觉得在洞穴里会有人朝你开枪?
You expecting to run into much gunfire in these caves?

560
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:29,015
这样, 我希望厄尔先生不要知道我借用它们...
Look, l'd rather Mr. Earle didn't know about me borrowing--

561
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:30,415
韦恩先生
Mr. Wayne...

562
00:51:30,655 --> 00:51:32,555
从我来看
...the way l see it...

563
00:51:33,024 --> 00:51:35,458
这些东西全都是你的
...all this stuff is yours anyway.

564
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,920
好, 试一试
Okay. Give it a try.

565
00:51:45,069 --> 00:51:46,297
够迷人
Charming.

566
00:51:49,174 --> 00:51:50,937
至少你有伴了
At least you'll have company.

567
00:51:52,844 --> 00:51:56,803
这里一定是东南方最深的地基
This must be the lowest foundation of the southeast wing.

568
00:52:09,294 --> 00:52:13,492
内战期间, 你的曾曾祖父曾经参与通过地下铁路
ln the Civil War, your great-great-grandfather was involved in the Underground Railroad...

569
00:52:13,665 --> 00:52:16,634
秘密将释放的奴隶运往北方的行动
...secretly transporting freed slaves to the North...

570
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:20,498
我怀疑这些坑洞就起了作用
...and l suspect these caverns came in handy.

571
00:52:33,184 --> 00:52:35,379
阿福! 来这里!
Alfred! Come up here!

572
00:52:35,587 --> 00:52:38,522
不了, 少爷, 我在这里能看得很清楚
l can see everything all right from down here, sir, thank you.

573
00:52:58,576 --> 00:53:01,204
通过傀儡公司
We order the main part of this cowl from Singapore.

574
00:53:01,379 --> 00:53:02,869
我们从新加坡运来头套的部件
Via a dummy corporation.

575
00:53:03,047 --> 00:53:04,912
然后, 其它的部件
lndeed. And then, quite separately...

576
00:53:05,083 --> 00:53:10,020
我们跟中国公司预定
...we place an order to a Chinese company for these.

577
00:53:10,555 --> 00:53:13,524
-然后自己组装 -正确
-Put it together ourselves. -Precisely.

578
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:17,718
订单量要大, 以免引起怀疑
They'll have to be large orders, to avoid suspicion.

579
00:53:17,896 --> 00:53:20,456
-多大? -不如, 一万套
-How large? -Say 1 0,000.

580
00:53:22,967 --> 00:53:25,902
-至少, 我们不缺配件了 -恩
-Well, at least we'll have spares. -Yes.

581
00:53:42,987 --> 00:53:45,046
我看你也不想来一份
Don't suppose you want a taste.

582
00:53:45,223 --> 00:53:48,386
我每次只管给你拿着, 以防你某天会变聪明
l just keep offering, thinking maybe someday you'll get wise.

583
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,721
你这样做没什么聪明可言, 弗拉斯
There's nothing wise in what you do, Flass.

584
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:54,262
哥们, 你不贪污, 会让我们很紧张
Well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste, makes us guys nervous.

585
00:53:54,432 --> 00:53:56,297
我不会告发
l'm no rat.

586
00:53:59,037 --> 00:54:02,734
再说这城市人人都贪, 我向谁去告发?
ln a town this bent, who's there to rat to anyway?

587
00:54:32,437 --> 00:54:34,564
别转身
Don't turn around.

588
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:38,232
你是个好警察, 少数份子
You're a good cop. One of the few.

589
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:40,036
你想怎么样?
What do you want?

590
00:54:40,211 --> 00:54:43,374
法康尼每周都往这里运毒品
Carmine Falcone brings in shipments of drugs every week.

591
00:54:43,548 --> 00:54:45,345
为什么没人抓他?
Nobody takes him down. Why?

592
00:54:46,751 --> 00:54:48,878
他给大人物们贿赂了
He's paid up with the right people.

593
00:54:49,187 --> 00:54:51,951
那要怎样才能扳倒他?
What will it take to bring him down?

594
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:55,090
给法官足够强的筹码
Leverage on Judge Faden...

595
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,192
和一个足够勇敢的检察官敢起诉他
...and a DA brave enough to prosecute.

596
00:54:58,596 --> 00:55:00,223
瑞秋`道斯
Rachel Dawes.

597
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:01,923
你是谁?
Who are you?

598
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:03,960
留意我的信号
Watch for my sign.

599
00:55:06,638 --> 00:55:08,663
你只有一个人呢?
You're just one man?

600
00:55:09,107 --> 00:55:10,540
现在我们是两个了
Now we're two.

601
00:55:12,644 --> 00:55:14,236
我们?
We?

602
00:55:29,894 --> 00:55:31,623
别动!
Freeze!

603
00:55:48,813 --> 00:55:50,747
那是什么东西?
What the hell was that?

604
00:55:53,651 --> 00:55:54,879
只是某个笨蛋
Just some nut.

605
00:55:58,289 --> 00:56:01,087
今天有什么活动, 还是洞穴探险?
Well, what is it today? More spelunking?

606
00:56:01,259 --> 00:56:03,727
不, 今天是定点跳跃
No. Today it's BASE-jumping.

607
00:56:04,329 --> 00:56:05,956
定点跳跃
BASE-jumping.

608
00:56:06,531 --> 00:56:09,091
-跳伞那种? -差不多
-That like parachuting? -Kind of.

609
00:56:10,301 --> 00:56:13,099
你有没有重量轻点的材料?
Do you have any lightweight fabrics?

610
00:56:13,271 --> 00:56:15,933
我正好有你需要的
You know, l think l have just the thing.

611
00:56:17,275 --> 00:56:19,709
这叫记忆布料, 听说过吗?
lt's called memory cloth. Notice anything?

612
00:56:23,047 --> 00:56:24,947
常态下很柔软
Regularly flexible...

613
00:56:25,350 --> 00:56:27,477
一旦通电
...but put a current through it...

614
00:56:28,953 --> 00:56:32,616
-分子重新排列, 就会变得很硬 -你能做出什么形状来?
-...molecules realign, it becomes rigid. -What kind of shapes can you make?

615
00:56:32,824 --> 00:56:35,918
根据合适骨架, 可以做出任何形状
Can be tailored to fit any structure based on a rigid skeleton.

616
00:56:36,094 --> 00:56:37,322
对军方来说又太贵了?
Too expensive for the Army?

617
00:56:37,495 --> 00:56:42,228
我看他们也不想卖给一个喜欢洞穴探险和定点跳跃的亿万富翁
l don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, BASE-jumping crowd.

618
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,197
-这样, 福克斯先生 -是, 先生
-Look, Mr. Fox. -Yes, sir?

619
00:56:44,869 --> 00:56:46,234
如果你觉得这样让你不舒服...
lf you're uncomfortable--

620
00:56:46,404 --> 00:56:49,601
韦恩先生, 只要你不告诉我任何事
Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing...

621
00:56:49,774 --> 00:56:51,742
那当我被问起的时候, 我也不用去撒谎了
...when l'm asked, l don't have to lie.

622
00:56:53,511 --> 00:56:56,105
只是不要把我当成个笨蛋就行
But don't think of me as an idiot.

623
00:56:57,615 --> 00:56:59,583
那就这样
Fair enough.

624
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:03,316
那是什么?
What's that?

625
00:57:05,356 --> 00:57:07,324
那辆车?
The Tumbler?

626
00:57:07,825 --> 00:57:09,793
额, 算了吧你不会感兴趣的
Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.

627
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,734
这车原本是为了搭桥用
She was built as a bridging vehicle.

628
00:57:19,704 --> 00:57:24,141
在战斗中, 两辆这种车会越过河面, 搭着管道
During combat, two of these would jump over a river, towing cables.

629
00:57:26,677 --> 00:57:30,306
这里有加速按钮, 轻按可以冲刺
Over here on the throttle, flip that open and throttle up.

630
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,040
这样可以获得跳跃前的高速动量...现在别!
This will boost you into a rampless jump-- Not now!

631
00:57:35,887 --> 00:57:38,014
现, 现在别, 先生
Not-- Not now, sir.

632
00:57:40,825 --> 00:57:42,725
加力引擎已熄火
Afterburner disengaged.

633
00:57:43,094 --> 00:57:46,120
我们从来没能研发出合适的桥来
We never could get the damn bridge to work...

634
00:57:46,297 --> 00:57:48,026
但这辆车很不错
...but this baby works just fine.

635
00:57:57,575 --> 00:57:58,803
你觉得怎么样?
So, what do you think?

636
00:58:00,078 --> 00:58:02,069
有没有黑色款?
Does it come in black?

637
00:58:02,713 --> 00:58:05,079
我要你星期四到码头来
I need you at the docks Thursday.

638
00:58:05,316 --> 00:58:07,216
-有问题? -我不想碰到任何麻烦
-Problems? -l don't want any trouble...

639
00:58:07,385 --> 00:58:09,478
-这是最后一批货 -好
-...with the last shipment. -Sure.

640
00:58:11,089 --> 00:58:14,752
传言说你在悬赏, 要帮人搞定一个检察官的女孩
Word on the street is you got a beef with somebody in the DA's office.

641
00:58:14,926 --> 00:58:17,326
-是吗? -报酬丰厚
-ls that right? -And that there's a fat prize...

642
00:58:17,495 --> 00:58:20,191
你在等着为钱敢做任何事的亡命徒
...waiting for anybody willing to do anything about it.

643
00:58:20,364 --> 00:58:22,332
你想说什么, 弗拉斯先生?
So, what's your point, Mr. Flass?

644
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,027
你见过那个女孩吗?
Have you seen the girl?

645
00:58:24,569 --> 00:58:27,231
是个漂亮的副检察官
It's a cute little assistant DA.

646
00:58:27,405 --> 00:58:31,068
你不担心这样做会引起公愤?
Don't you think that's a little bit too much heat to bring down, maybe?

647
00:58:31,242 --> 00:58:34,541
-就算对这城市来说也有点过了 -不要担心这城市
-Even for this town. -Never underestimate Gotham City.

648
00:58:34,712 --> 00:58:37,545
人们每天上下班都有可能被抢被杀
People get mugged coming home from work every day of the week.

649
00:58:37,715 --> 00:58:40,343
有时候只是你运气不好
Sometimes-- Sometimes things just go bad.

650
00:58:44,222 --> 00:58:46,019
这次的石墨有问题, 少爷
lt's a problem with the graphite, sir.

651
00:58:46,224 --> 00:58:48,920
下一批的一万套会符合规格
The next 1 0,000 will be up to specifications.

652
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:51,652
-至少他们给我们打折了 -没错
-At least they gave us a discount. -Quite.

653
00:58:51,829 --> 00:58:57,461
与此同时, 少爷, 我建议你先不要让头先落地
ln the meantime, sir, may l suggest you try to avoid landing on your head?

654
00:59:34,472 --> 00:59:36,497
为什么是蝙蝠, 韦恩少爷?
Why bats, Master Wayne?

655
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:38,003
蝙蝠曾让我恐惧
Bats frighten me.

656
00:59:39,277 --> 00:59:41,575
是时候让敌人分享我的恐惧了
lt's time my enemies shared my dread.

657
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:10,206
这是什么?
What is this?

658
01:00:14,011 --> 01:00:15,308
继续
Continue.

659
01:00:20,851 --> 01:00:22,512
一切正常
Looks fine out there.

660
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,820
玩具熊直接送给卖毒品的
The bears go straight to the dealers.

661
01:00:24,989 --> 01:00:27,651
玩具兔给奈何岛的人
Yeah, and the rabbits go to the man in the Narrows.

662
01:00:27,825 --> 01:00:30,851
-这有什么区别? -无知就是幸福, 伙计
-What's the difference? -lgnorance is bliss, my friend.

663
01:00:31,028 --> 01:00:34,191
不要去探听不该知道的秘密, 给自己惹麻烦
Don't burden yourself with the secrets of scary people.

664
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:53,016
斯戴西
Hey. Steiss.

665
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:15,805
斯戴西?
Steiss?

666
01:01:27,752 --> 01:01:29,344
什么?
What?

667
01:01:30,121 --> 01:01:31,588
怎么回事?
What the...?

668
01:01:40,564 --> 01:01:42,429
我去看看
l better check it.

669
01:01:54,979 --> 01:01:56,970
有麻烦了, 你赶紧走吧
There's a problem out here. You better bail.

670
01:02:26,277 --> 01:02:27,904
你在哪里?
Where are you?!

671
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:29,137
这里
Here.

672
01:02:50,201 --> 01:02:53,500
快开车
Get going. Oh, shit.

673
01:03:11,655 --> 01:03:13,782
你是什么东西?
What the hell are you?

674
01:03:16,827 --> 01:03:17,987
我是蝙蝠侠
l'm Batman.

675
01:03:26,337 --> 01:03:28,305
大衣蛮帅
Nice coat.

676
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,564
谢了
Thanks.

677
01:04:12,616 --> 01:04:13,844
别动
Hold it.

678
01:04:15,986 --> 01:04:18,454
这就对了, 滚吧
That's right, you better run.

679
01:04:27,397 --> 01:04:29,262
他们是法康尼派来杀你的
Falcone sent them to kill you.

680
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:32,961
-为什么? -你搅了他的好事
-Why? -You rattled his cage.

681
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:38,298
-这是什么? -筹码
-What's this? -Leverage.

682
01:04:38,476 --> 01:04:40,068
-做什么用? -行必行之事用
-For what? -To get things moving.

683
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:42,368
你是谁?
Who are you?

684
01:04:42,779 --> 01:04:44,007
和你一样
Someone like you.

685
01:04:44,181 --> 01:04:46,206
喜欢搅坏人好事的人
Someone who'll rattle the cages.

686
01:04:51,322 --> 01:04:54,814
女士, 你没事吧?
Ma'am? Everything okay?

687
01:04:59,129 --> 01:05:01,620
-法康尼的人? -有什么用
-Falcone's men? -Does it matter?

688
01:05:01,798 --> 01:05:04,062
我们又不能抓住他本人
We'll never tie him to it anyway.

689
01:05:04,301 --> 01:05:06,394
这次不同了
l wouldn't be too sure of that.

690
01:05:19,449 --> 01:05:21,280
那是什么?
What the hell is that?

691
01:05:30,895 --> 01:05:32,157
放他下来
Cut him down.

692
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:54,573
   


693
01:05:54,751 --> 01:05:55,979
不可接受
Unacceptable.

694
01:05:56,153 --> 01:05:58,986
我不管他是什么黑帮对头, 还是守护天使
Now, l don't care if it's rival gangs, Guardian Angels...

695
01:05:59,156 --> 01:06:01,124
还是什么狗日的救世军
...or the goddamn Salvation Army...

696
01:06:01,391 --> 01:06:03,723
把他抓起来, 别让他上头条
...get them off the street and off the front page.

697
01:06:03,894 --> 01:06:06,454
听说他只是一个人, 或者一种生物
They say it was just one guy. Or a creature.

698
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:09,326
只是某个变态异装癖
lt was some asshole in a costume.

699
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:11,528
-怎么? -这家伙确实帮我们制服了
-Yeah? -This guy did deliver us...

700
01:06:11,702 --> 01:06:14,466
这个城市最大的黑帮团伙
...one of the city's biggest crime lords.

701
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:18,130
在我的地头谁也别想动用私刑
No one takes the law into their own hands in my city.

702
01:06:18,309 --> 01:06:19,503
明白否?
Understand?

703
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:22,278
-证据确凿了 -法官那边呢
-No way to bury it now. -There's still Judge Faden.

704
01:06:22,446 --> 01:06:25,643
-我会去说服法官 -还有关于那个蝙蝠的传言?
-l've got Faden covered. -What about this bat they're babbling about?

705
01:06:25,816 --> 01:06:28,808
就算这些人渣辩解自己是被一只大蝙蝠抓住的
Even if these guys will swear to being thrashed by a giant bat...

706
01:06:28,986 --> 01:06:31,147
我们至少也抓到了法康尼的现行
...we've got Falcone at the scene.

707
01:06:31,322 --> 01:06:34,519
毒品, 照片, 货物清单, 这只蝙蝠给我们准备了一切
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests. This bat character gave us everything.

708
01:06:34,959 --> 01:06:36,483
好, 我们起诉!
Okay. Let's do it.

709
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:42,023
-蝙蝠是夜行动物 -可能吧
-Bats are nocturnal. -Bats may be.

710
01:06:42,232 --> 01:06:45,633
但就算你是个高富帅花花公子, 也别玩太晚
But even for billionaire playboys, 3:00 is pushing it.

711
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:49,537
恐怕这就是过双重生活的代价
The price for leading a double life, l fear.

712
01:06:50,908 --> 01:06:53,308
你的戏剧效果令人印象深刻
Your theatrics made an impression.

713
01:06:54,678 --> 01:06:57,704
戏剧效果只是装饰
Theatricality and deception...

714
01:06:57,881 --> 01:07:01,112
强大的武器才是好的开始, 阿福
...are powerful weapons, Alfred. This is a good start.

715
01:07:01,285 --> 01:07:04,083
如果你这些伤痕只是个开头
lf those are to be the first of many injuries to come...

716
01:07:04,254 --> 01:07:07,087
那最好找一个明智的借口
...it would be wise to find a suitable excuse.

717
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,756
比如打马球
Polo, for instance.

718
01:07:08,926 --> 01:07:10,553
我才不学马球, 阿福
l'm not learning polo, Alfred.

719
01:07:10,828 --> 01:07:14,491
奇怪的伤痕, 缺乏社交
Strange injuries, a nonexistent social life.

720
01:07:14,665 --> 01:07:16,132
这些会让人引起怀疑
These things beg the question...

721
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:20,532
到底布鲁斯`韦恩将他的时间金钱花在什么地方
...as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne do with his time and his money.

722
01:07:20,704 --> 01:07:22,296
那像我这样的人该做什么?
What does someone like me do?

723
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:27,472
开跑车, 泡女明星
Drive sports cars, date movie stars.

724
01:07:28,145 --> 01:07:29,703
买别人买不了的东西
Buy things that are not for sale.

725
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:33,441
谁知道, 少爷, 也许你假装寻欢作乐
Who knows, Master Wayne, you start pretending to have fun...

726
01:07:34,051 --> 01:07:36,042
说不定偶尔真能从中取乐
...you might even have a little by accident.

727
01:07:38,755 --> 01:07:40,222
先生
Sir.

728
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:42,722
-我们有麻烦了 -是什么
-We have a situation. -All right.

729
01:07:43,126 --> 01:07:46,926
海岸警卫队昨晚找到我们一艘船
The Coast Guard picked up one of our cargo ships last night...

730
01:07:47,498 --> 01:07:52,265
受伤严重, 船员失踪, 估计已经死了
...heavily damaged, all crew missing, probably dead.

731
01:07:54,338 --> 01:07:58,707
这艘船原本装有一款武器原型, 微波发射器
The ship was carrying a prototype weapon. It's a microwave emitter.

732
01:07:58,876 --> 01:08:01,845
为沙漠作战设计的
lt's designed for desert warfare, but it--

733
01:08:03,514 --> 01:08:05,072
现在看起来有人
lt looks like somebody...

734
01:08:09,486 --> 01:08:10,976
把它启动了
...turned it on.

735
01:08:15,159 --> 01:08:19,596
它使用微波将敌人的供水蒸发掉
lt uses focused microwaves to vaporize the enemy's water supply.

736
01:08:27,538 --> 01:08:30,473
船受损非常严重
The damage to the ship was catastrophic.

737
01:08:30,641 --> 01:08:33,633
武器本身
The weapon itself is....

738
01:08:34,945 --> 01:08:36,435
不见了?
Missing?

739
01:08:37,281 --> 01:08:38,543
是
Yeah.

740
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:41,784
韦恩先生
Mr. Wayne.

741
01:08:45,522 --> 01:08:46,955
车子真炫
Nice car.

742
01:08:47,124 --> 01:08:48,523
我的另一辆更炫
You should see my other one.

743
01:08:58,535 --> 01:09:00,469
他做了警察都做不了的事
He's done something the police never have.

744
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:02,935
可你不能擅用私法
You can't take the law into your own hands.

745
01:09:03,106 --> 01:09:05,666
但至少他做了有益的事
Well, at least he's getting something done.

746
01:09:05,843 --> 01:09:08,175
布鲁斯, 帮我辩一下
Bruce, help me out here.

747
01:09:08,345 --> 01:09:12,714
一个穿着像个蝙蝠的人, 脑袋肯定有问题
Well, a guy who dresses up like a bat clearly has issues.

748
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:15,980
但他把法康尼绳之於法了
But he's put Falcone behind bars.

749
01:09:16,153 --> 01:09:18,519
现在警察却想把他也抓了, 你怎么认为?
Now the cops want to bring him in. What does that tell you?

750
01:09:18,689 --> 01:09:19,917
他们在嫉妒
They're jealous.

751
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:22,718
先生, 池子是用来观赏用的
Sir, the pool is for decoration...

752
01:09:22,893 --> 01:09:26,260
你的朋友们不能下去游泳
...and your friends do not have swimwear.

753
01:09:28,065 --> 01:09:30,033
哦, 她们是欧洲豪放派
Well, they're European.

754
01:09:31,902 --> 01:09:34,268
我不得不要求你离开
l'm going to have to ask you to leave.

755
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:36,867
这不是小费的问题
-lt is not a question of money.

756
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,632
是这样
Well, you see...

757
01:09:39,243 --> 01:09:41,006
我买下这间酒店
...l'm buying this hotel...

758
01:09:42,813 --> 01:09:47,216
以后这里的池子要有一套新的规则
...and setting some new rules about the pool area.

759
01:09:48,385 --> 01:09:50,785
我觉得应该颁给蝙蝠侠一个奖牌
l think the Batman deserves a medal.

760
01:09:50,954 --> 01:09:53,081
还要给他套紧身衣, 把他钉起来
And a straitjacket to pin it on.

761
01:09:59,563 --> 01:10:01,155
谢谢
Thank you.

762
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:04,265
布鲁斯?
Bruce?

763
01:10:07,838 --> 01:10:09,635
瑞秋?
Rachel?

764
01:10:09,806 --> 01:10:11,205
听说你回来了
l'd heard you were back.

765
01:10:13,277 --> 01:10:14,744
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

766
01:10:15,512 --> 01:10:19,949
在游游泳, 很高兴见到你
Just swimming here. Wow, it is good to see you.

767
01:10:20,117 --> 01:10:21,641
你消失好久了
You were gone a long time.

768
01:10:22,219 --> 01:10:25,154
-我知道, 最近怎么样? -老样子
-l know. How are things? -The same.

769
01:10:27,057 --> 01:10:28,718
工作越来越糟糕
Job's getting worse.

770
01:10:28,892 --> 01:10:31,622
你可不能光靠自己改变世界
Can't change the world on your own.

771
01:10:31,795 --> 01:10:33,854
你在忙着游泳取乐的时候
What choice do l have...

772
01:10:34,531 --> 01:10:36,294
我有什么选择吗?
...when you're too busy swimming?

773
01:10:37,601 --> 01:10:39,660
瑞秋, 所有这些
Rachel, all of--

774
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:41,597
这些...
All this....

775
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:47,067
这些都不是我...
lt's-- lt's not me. lt's....

776
01:10:47,511 --> 01:10:50,139
其实我的内心
lnside, l am....

777
01:10:51,348 --> 01:10:53,282
没这么肤浅
l am more.

778
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:55,509
来啊, 布鲁斯, 快点
Come on, Bruce. Come on.

779
01:10:55,686 --> 01:10:59,486
布鲁斯, 我们还要去买更多的酒店
Bruce, we have some more hotels for you to buy.

780
01:11:00,524 --> 01:11:01,991
布鲁斯...
Bruce...

781
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:06,652
在你内心里你还是那个可爱的小孩子
...deep down you may still be that same great kid you used to be.

782
01:11:09,066 --> 01:11:11,660
但是你外表底下是谁不重要
But it's not who you are underneath...

783
01:11:12,102 --> 01:11:13,865
决定你自身的是你的所作所为
...it's what you do that defines you.

784
01:11:26,416 --> 01:11:28,008
克莱恩博士, 感谢你过来
Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.

785
01:11:28,185 --> 01:11:31,052
不客气, 他割腕?
Not at all. He cut his wrists?

786
01:11:31,221 --> 01:11:34,884
估计他只是为了装疯求假释, 不过如果真有问题...
Probably looking for the insanity plea. But if anything should happen....

787
01:11:35,058 --> 01:11:37,993
当然, 以防万一
Of course, better safe than sorry.

788
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:44,991
好了吧, 克莱恩博士, 我已经受不了了
Yeah, Dr. Crane, l can't take it anymore. lt's all too much.

789
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:47,635
什么世界末日之类唧唧歪歪的胡话
The walls are closing in. Blah, blah, blah.

790
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:50,695
再吃几天这里的饭, 我就不用再装了, 会真疯掉
A couple of days of this food, it'll be true.

791
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:53,369
-你想怎样? -我想知道
-What do you want? -l wanna know...

792
01:11:53,543 --> 01:11:56,011
你如何让我闭嘴
...how you're gonna convince me to keep my mouth shut.

793
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:58,373
关于什么闭嘴? 你什么都不知道
About what? You don't know anything.

794
01:11:58,548 --> 01:12:02,712
我知道你不想让条子仔细检查那些缴获的毒品
l know you don't want the cops to take a closer look at the drugs they seized.

795
01:12:02,886 --> 01:12:07,050
我还知道你和那些白痴同伙在搞的实验
And l know about your experiments with the inmates of your nut house.

796
01:12:07,224 --> 01:12:10,887
明白吗? 不搞清楚你们的肮脏底细和你的人手
See, l don't go into business with a guy without finding out his dirty secrets.

797
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:14,361
我哪里会跟你做生意
And those goons you used.

798
01:12:14,531 --> 01:12:16,362
这地方是我的地头
l own the muscle in this town.

799
01:12:16,533 --> 01:12:19,934
这几个月，我一直在帮你们带货
Now, l've been bringing your stuff in for months...

800
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:24,667
不管你们在密谋什么, 肯定很大单, 我要入伙
...so whatever he's planning, it's big, and l want in.

801
01:12:25,976 --> 01:12:29,104
恩, 我已经知道他会说什么了
Well, l already know what he'll say.

802
01:12:29,513 --> 01:12:30,878
他会说我们应该杀了你
That we should kill you.

803
01:12:32,783 --> 01:12:36,082
在这城市, 就算他也不能把我怎么样
Even he can't get me in here. Not in my town.

804
01:12:42,025 --> 01:12:43,549
你想看看我的面具吗?
Would you like to see my mask?

805
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:46,560
我在实验里用它
l use it in my experiments.

806
01:12:49,066 --> 01:12:53,526
估计我这样的人, 根本吓不住你
Now, l'm probably not very frightening to a guy like you.

807
01:12:53,937 --> 01:12:56,735
不过这些玩意儿, 实验中谁也受不了
But these crazies, they can't stand it.

808
01:12:57,674 --> 01:12:59,642
你们这些白痴真在搞什么破烂玩意儿?
So when did the nut take over the nut house?

809
01:13:00,577 --> 01:13:03,273
他们又哭又叫
They scream and they cry...

810
01:13:04,247 --> 01:13:05,874
跟你现在一样
...much as you're doing now.

811
01:13:08,218 --> 01:13:11,415
他不是装的, 这回真疯了
Well, he's not faking. Not that one.

812
01:13:11,588 --> 01:13:14,148
我去跟法官说下看能不能
l'll talk to the judge and see if l can get him moved...

813
01:13:14,324 --> 01:13:17,725
把他转到我的医院, 我在那里治他
...to the secure wing at Arkham. l can't treat him here.

814
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:41,240
暴风雨要来了
Storm's coming.

815
01:13:45,856 --> 01:13:48,848
暴徒们现在很慌张, 因为你敢直面法康尼
The scum is getting jumpy because you stood up to Falcone.

816
01:13:49,026 --> 01:13:52,553
只是个开始, 在码头我看到你的搭档跟法康尼一起
lt's a start. Your partner was at the docks with Falcone.

817
01:13:52,729 --> 01:13:55,425
他只是个低级无间道
Well, he moonlights as a low-level enforcer.

818
01:13:55,799 --> 01:13:59,599
他们把货物分成两份, 只有一份给了卖毒品的
They were splitting the shipment in two. Only half went to the dealers.

819
01:13:59,770 --> 01:14:01,704
为什么, 另一半呢?
Why? What about the other half?

820
01:14:02,172 --> 01:14:04,572
-弗拉斯知道 -他不会说
-Flass knows. -He won't talk.

821
01:14:05,208 --> 01:14:06,766
他会对我说
He'll talk to me.

822
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:09,969
罗伯警长调派了大量警力要抓你
Commissioner Loeb set up a massive task force to catch you.

823
01:14:10,447 --> 01:14:12,972
-他觉得你是危险份子 -你觉得呢?
-He thinks you're dangerous. -What do you think?

824
01:14:14,751 --> 01:14:17,185
我认为你是在帮忙
l think you're trying to help.

825
01:14:22,192 --> 01:14:24,490
当然我也可能看错
But l've been wrong before.

826
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,995
快点, 没空跟你耗一晚上
Come on, l ain't got all night.

827
01:14:35,372 --> 01:14:37,169
弗拉斯, 我还要养孩子
Flass, l have kids to feed.

828
01:14:37,641 --> 01:14:39,802
他们不喜欢吃三明治?
What, they don't like falafel?

829
01:14:55,225 --> 01:14:56,920
另一半毒品去哪里了?
Where were the other drugs going?

830
01:14:58,228 --> 01:15:00,389
我不知道, 从不知道
l never knew. l don't know.

831
01:15:00,564 --> 01:15:02,759
-我向上帝发誓 -向我发誓!
-l swear to God. -Swear to me!

832
01:15:08,405 --> 01:15:11,397
我不知道, 真的从不知道
l don't-- l don't know. l never knew. Never.

833
01:15:11,775 --> 01:15:15,108
毒品流向买家前他们去见了某个家伙
They went to some guy for a couple days before they went to the dealers.

834
01:15:15,278 --> 01:15:16,609
为什么?
Why?

835
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:20,841
毒品里有些其它的东西
There was something-- Something else in the drugs...

836
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:22,609
-藏有其它东西 -是什么?
-...something hidden. -What?

837
01:15:22,786 --> 01:15:26,119
我从没去过卸货地点, 那是在奈何岛
l never went to the drop-off point. lt was in the Narrows.

838
01:15:26,289 --> 01:15:29,554
-警察只有在成群结队的时候才敢去那里 -我看起来像警察吗?
-Cops only go there when they're in force. -Do l look like a cop?

839
01:15:29,726 --> 01:15:31,523
不
No--

840
01:15:45,142 --> 01:15:47,167
我说的就是这个
This is the one l'm talking about.

841
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:49,740
-这有什么问题? -它不应该存在
-What's your problem with it? -lt shouldn't exist.

842
01:15:49,913 --> 01:15:53,781
这艘船离开新加坡时有246个集装箱, 现在有247个
This ship left Singapore with 246 containers, but arrived with 247.

843
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:56,077
我猜这里有些本该不存在的东西
l'm guessing there's something l'm not supposed to find in there.

844
01:15:56,253 --> 01:15:59,882
求你了, 检察官, 我们不想探听法康尼的货
Listen, counselor, we don't wanna know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.

845
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:03,389
世道变了, 打开它
Things are working a little differently now. Open it up.

846
01:16:10,167 --> 01:16:12,158
 


847
01:16:13,003 --> 01:16:14,231
这到底是什么?
What the hell is this?

848
01:16:56,846 --> 01:17:00,009
是你! 真的是! 所有人都在谈论你
lt's you, isn't it? Everybody's been talking about you.

849
01:17:00,584 --> 01:17:02,347
快进来!
Get in here!

850
01:17:02,953 --> 01:17:05,080
其他孩子不会相信我的
The other kids won't believe me.

851
01:17:28,178 --> 01:17:30,305
灭掉所有证据
Get rid of all traces.

852
01:17:30,614 --> 01:17:33,515
-最好烧了这地方 -好
-Better torch the whole place. -All right.

853
01:18:09,552 --> 01:18:11,349
有麻烦了?
Having trouble?

854
01:18:12,055 --> 01:18:14,421
坐下来, 喝点东西
Take a seat. Have a drink.

855
01:18:15,125 --> 01:18:18,356
你看起来似乎是个太过于严肃的家伙
You look like a man who takes himself too seriously.

856
01:18:22,065 --> 01:18:25,057
想听听我的意见吗? 阳光一点吧
Do you want my opinion? You need to lighten up.

857
01:19:17,053 --> 01:19:20,750
阿福, 帮帮我
Alfred, help me.

858
01:19:30,667 --> 01:19:34,034
血...毒...中...中毒了
Blood. Take. Take poison. Blood poison.

859
01:19:34,204 --> 01:19:37,173
有毒, 有毒
Poisonous. Poisonous.

860
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:43,205
布鲁斯
Bruce...

861
01:19:44,481 --> 01:19:45,675
为什么我们会跌倒?
...why do we fall?

862
01:19:57,657 --> 01:20:00,990
-我昏了多久? -两天
-How long was l out? -Two days.

863

欢迎归来
Many happy returns.

865
01:20:11,037 --> 01:20:14,871
我之前感受过那种感觉, 但这回剂量更大
l've felt these effects before, but this was so much more potent.

866
01:20:15,041 --> 01:20:19,603
是某种迷幻剂, 被人气化, 当作武器
lt was some kind of hallucinogen, weaponized, in aerosol form.

867
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:22,749
你最近貌似泡的酒吧都不是正路啊, 韦恩先生
You have been hanging out in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.

868
01:20:22,915 --> 01:20:25,975
你第一天情况变糟的时候我找了福克斯先生
l called Mr. Fox when your condition worsened after the first day.

869
01:20:26,153 --> 01:20:31,216
我分析了你的血样, 分离了受体化合物和做了蛋白质分析
l analyzed your blood, isolating the receptor compounds and the protein-based catalyst.

870
01:20:31,391 --> 01:20:33,154
我听不明白
Am l meant to understand any of that?

871
01:20:33,559 --> 01:20:36,722
没关系, 我就想告诉你过程有多困难
Not at all. l just wanted you to know how hard it was.

872
01:20:37,296 --> 01:20:40,993
-最终, 我做出了疫苗 -你能做更多疫苗不?
-Bottom line, l synthesized an antidote. -Could you make more?

873
01:20:41,168 --> 01:20:43,864
韦恩先生, 你还打算去嗨更多的药?
You planning on gassing yourself again, Mr. Wayne?

874
01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:47,130
是啊, 你知道的, 晚上去寻欢作乐
Well, you know how it is. You're out at night, looking for kicks...

875
01:20:47,306 --> 01:20:50,070
总有人喜欢刺激, 非要嗑高才行
...someone's passing around the weaponized hallucinogens....

876
01:20:50,243 --> 01:20:53,679
我会尽力, 这个疫苗你先接种
l'll bring what l have. The antidote should inoculate you for now.

877
01:20:53,847 --> 01:20:56,247
阿福, 走了
Alfred, always a pleasure.

878
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:58,043

-你确定不进来了? -我要回去了
-You sure you don't want to come in? -l have to get back.

880
01:21:05,392 --> 01:21:07,121
-只是想给你这个 -谢了
-l wanted to leave this. -Thank you.

881
01:21:07,294 --> 01:21:08,659

882
01:21:10,030 --> 01:21:13,261
看来某人最近一直在熬夜啊
Looks like someone's been burning the candle at both ends.

883

-Must've been quite an occasion. -lt is my birthday.

-你要去哪? -我上司失踪两天了
-You've got better plans? -My boss has been missing for two days...

886
01:21:23,743 --> 01:21:27,474
这意味着我要开始寻找他的尸体了
...which means l should probably start by looking at the bottom of the river.

887
01:21:27,647 --> 01:21:29,137
-瑞秋 -请原谅
-Rachel. -Excuse me.

888
01:21:32,018 --> 01:21:33,246
瑞秋`道斯

谁允许的? 把克莱恩叫过去, 别管他说什么
Who authorized that? Get Crane down there now. Don't take no for an answer.

891
01:21:41,928 --> 01:21:43,759

-What's wrong? -lt's Falcone.

克莱恩博士要把他转到他的精神病院, 做自杀预防
Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum on suicide watch.

893
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:49,592
你要去那个精神病院? 那是在奈何岛
You're going to Arkham now? lt's in the Narrows, Rachel.

894
01:21:50,871 --> 01:21:52,702

但是少爷, 客人就要来了
But, Master Wayne, the guests will be arriving.

给他们说笑话
Tell them that joke you know.

901

01:23:07,314 --> 01:23:10,909
什么风把你这大人物吹到这小地方来了?
Bill? Now, what's a big shot like you doing in a place like this?

903
01:23:11,084 --> 01:23:12,346

lt's a microwave emitter. lt was designed to vaporize an enemy's water supply.

Rumor was they tested dispersing water-based chemical agents into the air...

908
01:23:28,602 --> 01:23:30,570
但这不是非法的吗?

909
01:23:32,271 --> 01:23:36,503
我要有关这武器发展的所有信息

...all data, files, backup disks, on my desk right away.

911
01:23:41,081 --> 01:23:42,742
你们把它弄丢了?
Did you lose one?

912
01:23:43,783 --> 01:23:47,412
我要把你的部门和档案部合并

然后开除你

道斯小姐, 你的到访我很意外

给法官的报告里, 我该写的都写了
l have nothing to add to the report l filed with the judge.

920
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:23,484

lsn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man who has no history of mental illness...

922
01:24:28,128 --> 01:24:31,723
在上法庭前忽然精神崩溃, 是不是太走运了?
...to suddenly have a psychotic breakdown just when he's about to be indicted?

923
01:24:31,898 --> 01:24:36,164
额, 你也看到了, 从他的症状来看我觉得一点也不走运
Well, as you can see for yourself, there is nothing convenient about his symptoms.

924
01:24:40,807 --> 01:24:42,206

928
01:24:52,185 --> 01:24:54,585
在他的案例, 外部力量就是稻草人

在外头, 他是个人物

在这里, 精神才能给你力量
ln here, only the mind can grant you power.

933
01:25:07,633 --> 01:25:09,328
你很享受这种反转
You enjoy the reversal.

934
01:25:09,536 --> 01:25:12,562
我认为精神的力量大于肉体
l respect the mind's power over the body.

935
01:25:12,739 --> 01:25:14,263
这就是我干这行的原因
lt's why l do what l do.

936
01:25:14,441 --> 01:25:19,378
而我的专业是把法康尼这种恶棍绳之於法, 不是给他们治病
l do what l do to keep thugs like Falcone behind bars, not in therapy.

937
01:25:19,546 --> 01:25:22,845
我要求我自己的精神病顾问给法康尼全面检查
l want my own psychiatric consultant to have full access to Falcone...

938
01:25:23,016 --> 01:25:26,315
包括血样, 要找出你给他开了什么药
...including blood work. Find out what exactly you put him on.

939
01:25:26,486 --> 01:25:28,977
-那好, 明天一早就办 -今晚
-First thing tomorrow, then. -Tonight.

940
01:25:29,155 --> 01:25:32,613
我已经联系市总医院的医生了
l've already paged Dr. Lehmann at County General.

941
01:25:34,027 --> 01:25:35,824
如你所愿
As you wish.

942
01:25:41,367 --> 01:25:43,301
请这边走
This way, please.

943
01:25:43,470 --> 01:25:46,098
我觉得有些东西你要看看
There's something l think you should see.

944
01:25:56,983 --> 01:25:59,611
这就是我们制药的地方
This is where we make the medicine.

945
01:26:06,426 --> 01:26:10,328
也许你也该来点药, 清清脑子
Perhaps you should have some, clear your head.

946
01:26:35,588 --> 01:26:37,180
谁知道你来这里?
Who knows you're here?

947
01:26:38,224 --> 01:26:39,851
谁知道?
Who knows?

948
01:26:47,066 --> 01:26:48,328
他来了
He's here.

949
01:26:48,501 --> 01:26:49,763
谁?
Who?

950
01:26:49,936 --> 01:26:51,870
蝙蝠侠
The Batman.

951
01:26:53,673 --> 01:26:55,607
-我们怎么办? -当强盗来的时候
-What do we do? -What anyone does...

952
01:26:55,775 --> 01:26:58,539
我们该怎么办?
...when a prowler comes around.

953
01:26:59,479 --> 01:27:02,039
-报警去 -你想让警察来这里?
-Call the police. -You want the cops here?

954
01:27:02,582 --> 01:27:05,380
在这节骨眼, 警察奈何不了我们
At this point, they can't stop us.

955
01:27:05,551 --> 01:27:09,078
但蝙蝠侠一向是个麻烦
But the Batman has a talent for disruption.

956
01:27:09,255 --> 01:27:12,486
把他逼到外面, 警察会对付他, 行动
Force him outside, the police will take him down. Go.

957
01:27:12,659 --> 01:27:14,752
-她怎么办? -她活不长了
-What about her? -She hasn't got long.

958
01:27:14,927 --> 01:27:19,660
我给了她很大剂量, 她脑子承受不了的, 走吧
l gave her a concentrated dose. The mind can only take so much. Now go.

959
01:27:22,168 --> 01:27:24,466
人们说这家伙
The things they say about him.

960
01:27:24,637 --> 01:27:26,161
真的能飞?
Can he really fly?

961
01:27:26,339 --> 01:27:28,398
我听说他能隐身
l heard he can disappear.

962
01:27:28,574 --> 01:27:31,600
我们马上就会知道
Well, we'll find out.

963
01:27:31,878 --> 01:27:33,539
对吧?
Won't we?

964
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:22,987
试试你自己的药吧, 博士
Taste of your own medicine, doctor?

965
01:28:29,635 --> 01:28:31,535
你们在这里都干了什么?
What have you been doing here?

966
01:28:34,607 --> 01:28:37,007
你为谁卖命?
Who are you working for?

967
01:28:41,447 --> 01:28:43,813
忍, 忍者大师
Ra's-- Ra's al Ghul.

968
01:28:43,983 --> 01:28:48,852
忍者大师已经死了, 你为谁卖命?
Ra's al Ghul is dead. Who are you working for?

969
01:28:49,022 --> 01:28:50,046
克莱恩
Crane.

970
01:28:52,558 --> 01:28:55,493
克莱恩博士现在不在
Dr. Crane isn't here right now.

971
01:28:56,062 --> 01:28:57,962
如果你想要预约病号, 请打电话...
But if you'd like to make an appointment....

972
01:29:10,977 --> 01:29:13,878
蝙蝠侠, 放下武器投降
Batman, put down your weapons and surrender.

973
01:29:14,614 --> 01:29:16,013
你被包围了
You're surrounded.

974
01:29:21,554 --> 01:29:24,352
-你们在等什么? -援兵
-What are you waiting for? -Backup.

975
01:29:25,091 --> 01:29:27,491
-援兵? -蝙蝠侠在里面
-Backup? -The Batman's in there.

976
01:29:27,660 --> 01:29:29,821
霹雳小组快来了, 不过如果你要进去
SWAT's on the way. But if you wanna go in now...

977
01:29:29,996 --> 01:29:31,520
我在后头跟着你, 长官
...l'll be right behind you, sir.

978
01:29:33,032 --> 01:29:34,590
霹雳小组就要到了
SWAT's on the way.

979
01:29:35,668 --> 01:29:36,965
 
-Hey. -Hey.

980
01:30:19,445 --> 01:30:21,174
她怎么了?
What's happened to her?

981
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:27,650
克莱恩给她放了一种迷幻剂药物, 一种致幻毒素
Crane poisoned her with a psychotropic hallucinogen, a panic-inducing toxin.

982
01:30:29,622 --> 01:30:33,388
-让我送她去医院 -医院帮不了她, 我能
-Let me get her down to the medics. -They can't help her, but l can.

983
01:30:37,295 --> 01:30:39,490
带她到楼下, 我们在小巷会合
Get her downstairs. Meet me in the alley.

984
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:50,341
克莱恩一直把毒药放在法康尼走私的毒品里
Crane's been smuggling his toxin hidden in Falcone's drugs...

985
01:30:50,510 --> 01:30:52,671
他们把药放到城市的供水系统中
...and they're dumping it into the water supply.

986
01:30:53,179 --> 01:30:54,840
-他们打算做什么? -不知道
-What was he planning? -l don't know.

987
01:30:55,048 --> 01:30:56,379
他是为法康尼卖命吗?
Was he working for Falcone?

988
01:30:56,849 --> 01:30:59,374
他提到另一个人, 更可怕的人
He mentioned someone else, someone worse.

989
01:30:59,552 --> 01:31:02,112
她需要解药, 否则伤害会变永久性的
She needs the antidote before the damage is permanent.

990
01:31:02,288 --> 01:31:04,483
-她还能撑多久? -不久
-How long does she have? -Not long.

991
01:31:08,394 --> 01:31:10,191
那是什么?
What is that?

992
01:31:11,564 --> 01:31:13,828
援兵
-Backup. -What the--?

993
01:32:32,044 --> 01:32:33,602
请原谅
Excuse me.

994
01:32:38,351 --> 01:32:41,616
-她怎么样? -快不行了, 我们走
-How is she? -She's fading. We gotta go.

995
01:32:43,422 --> 01:32:44,889
我去拿车来
l'll get my car.

996
01:32:45,057 --> 01:32:46,888
我开了我的来
l brought mine.

997
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:48,921
你的车?
Yours?

998
01:32:58,237 --> 01:33:00,068
我也要找辆这样的车
l've gotta get me one of those.

999
01:33:01,307 --> 01:33:03,434
-他在一辆车里 -颜色和车型?
-He is in a vehicle. -Make and color?

1000
01:33:03,643 --> 01:33:06,009
是一辆黑色的...
lt's a black...

1001
01:33:07,313 --> 01:33:08,610
坦克
...tank.

1002
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:12,615
保持镇静
Stay calm.

1003
01:33:13,286 --> 01:33:15,083
你被下毒了
You've been poisoned.

1004
01:33:17,790 --> 01:33:19,121
我跟上他了
l'm on him.

1005
01:33:27,533 --> 01:33:28,591
慢慢呼吸
Breathe slowly.

1006
01:33:38,711 --> 01:33:39,837
撑住
Hold on.

1007
01:33:54,292 --> 01:33:55,691
-你要干什么? -抄近路
-What are you doing? -Shortcut.

1008
01:34:04,170 --> 01:34:05,967
空中呼叫地面, 封锁那个斜坡
Air One to ground, block that ramp.

1009
01:34:10,543 --> 01:34:12,135
他上屋顶后就没路了
He's got no way off that roof.

1010
01:34:13,546 --> 01:34:16,640
关掉引擎, 走出车外
Turn off your engine. Step away from the car.

1011
01:34:18,985 --> 01:34:21,783
-相信我 -启动武器系统
-Trust me. -Weapons system activated.

1012
01:34:39,672 --> 01:34:40,969
这家伙是谁?
Who is this guy?

1013
01:34:41,274 --> 01:34:43,003
-他在哪里? -他在屋顶
-Where's he going? -He's on the roof.

1014
01:34:57,390 --> 01:34:59,620
-在哪条街? -他不在街上
-What street is he taking? -He's not on a street.

1015
01:34:59,792 --> 01:35:01,521
他在屋顶上飞
He's flying on rooftops.

1016
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:42,964
至少告诉我那车长什么样
At least tell me what it looks like.

1017
01:35:46,005 --> 01:35:47,472
算了
Never mind.

1018
01:35:51,344 --> 01:35:52,709
找到他了
Got him.

1019
01:36:03,588 --> 01:36:05,180
正在追踪
Coming right up on his butt.

1020
01:36:29,882 --> 01:36:32,316
嫌犯车辆正在向I- 17方向开去, 追踪中
We're tracking suspect vehicle heading west on I- 1 7.

1021
01:36:37,590 --> 01:36:39,285
-空中呼叫地面 -他不见了
-Air One to ground. -l lost him.

1022
01:36:39,458 --> 01:36:41,358
他消失了, 9号出口已封锁
We've lost visual. Exit 9 is blocked.

1023
01:36:41,527 --> 01:36:43,518
我们绕回去看看临街道路
We'll loop back to check the frontage road.

1024
01:36:43,696 --> 01:36:45,789
隐身模式启动
Stealth mode activated.

1025
01:36:46,432 --> 01:36:47,694
撑住
Stay with me.

1026
01:36:53,873 --> 01:36:55,363
怎么? 他在那!
What--? There he is.

1027
01:37:15,027 --> 01:37:16,494
撑住
Just hold on.

1028
01:37:20,466 --> 01:37:21,660
瑞秋!
Rachel!

1029
01:37:35,915 --> 01:37:38,440
 


1030
01:37:54,433 --> 01:37:56,765
-主供水系统里有他们放的药吗? -有
-They get any of this crap into the mains? -Yeah.

1031
01:37:56,968 --> 01:37:59,835
通知自来水公司, 一定有办法隔离
Notify the water company. There's gotta be a way to isolate it.

1032
01:38:00,005 --> 01:38:02,872
没用, 所有管道都有, 他们一定几星期前就开始了
No. They put it all in. They must've been at this for weeks.

1033
01:38:03,042 --> 01:38:05,203
-歌谭所有的供水系统现在都被放药了
-Gotham's entire water supply is laced with it.

1034
01:38:05,377 --> 01:38:06,639
-那我们怎么还没中毒?
-Why haven't we felt the effects?

1035
01:38:06,812 --> 01:38:09,110
一定是一种只能通过肺吸收的化合物
Must be a compound that has to be absorbed through the lungs.

1036
01:38:19,325 --> 01:38:21,020
感觉怎么样?
How do you feel?

1037
01:38:23,796 --> 01:38:25,263
我们在哪?
Where are we?

1038
01:38:25,764 --> 01:38:29,564
-你为什么带我来这里? -如果不带你来这里, 你就要发疯了
-Why did you bring me here? -lf l hadn't, your mind would now be lost.

1039
01:38:29,735 --> 01:38:31,794
-你被下毒了 -那是...
-You were poisoned. -lt was--

1040
01:38:31,971 --> 01:38:35,566
-克莱恩博士干的 -放松, 戈登已经抓住他了
-lt was Dr. Crane. -Rest. Gordon has Crane.

1041
01:38:35,741 --> 01:38:37,868
戈登警官是你朋友吗?
ls Sergeant Gordon your friend?

1042
01:38:38,711 --> 01:38:40,372
我没那么好运有朋友
l don't have the luxury of friends.

1043
01:38:41,247 --> 01:38:44,580
我给你来点镇静剂, 你醒来就到家了
l'm gonna give you a sedative. You'll wake up back at home.

1044
01:38:44,750 --> 01:38:48,709
醒来后把这个给戈登本人, 其他人不要信
When you do, get these to Gordon, and Gordon alone. Trust no one.

1045
01:38:48,888 --> 01:38:50,617
-是什么? -解药
-What are they? -The antidote.

1046
01:38:50,789 --> 01:38:54,122
一个给戈登自己接种, 另一个用来量产
One for Gordon to inoculate himself, the other for mass production.

1047
01:38:54,527 --> 01:38:55,824
量产?
Mass production?

1048
01:38:55,995 --> 01:38:59,158
克莱恩只是个爪牙, 我们要做好准备
Crane was just a pawn. We need to be ready.

1049
01:39:25,090 --> 01:39:28,548
当你告诉我你要拯救歌谭市的伟大计划时
When you told me your grand plan for saving Gotham...

1050
01:39:28,727 --> 01:39:31,594
我没有打电话送你进精神病院
...all that stopped me from calling the men in white coats...

1051
01:39:31,764 --> 01:39:34,232
是因为你说这不是为了找刺激
...was when you said it wasn't about thrill-seeking.

1052
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:37,460
-当然不是 -那你把这叫什么?
-lt's not. -What would you call that?

1053
01:39:37,636 --> 01:39:38,864
 


1054
01:39:39,337 --> 01:39:41,931
-好看的电视剧 -没人伤亡已经是奇迹了
-Damn good television. -lt's a miracle no one was killed.

1055
01:39:42,107 --> 01:39:45,873
我没有时间遵守交通规则了, 阿福
l didn't have time to observe the rules of the road, Alfred.

1056
01:39:46,045 --> 01:39:49,139
你已经快控制不住内心的疯狂了
You're getting lost inside this monster of yours.

1057
01:39:49,315 --> 01:39:53,718
像我父亲一样, 我用内心的疯狂帮助其他人
l'm using this monster to help other people, just like my father did.

1058
01:39:53,919 --> 01:39:55,477
对托马斯`韦恩来说, 帮助其他人
For Thomas Wayne, helping others...

1059
01:39:55,654 --> 01:39:58,555
不是向任何人证明什么, 包括他自己
...wasn't about proving anything to anyone, including himself.

1060
01:39:59,024 --> 01:40:02,425
阿福, 瑞秋有危险, 她当时快死了
lt's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying.

1061
01:40:02,828 --> 01:40:05,388
她在楼下, 睡过去了, 我要你带她回家
She's downstairs, sedated. l need you to take her home.

1062
01:40:05,864 --> 01:40:09,356
我们都很关心瑞秋,但你所作的已经超过限度了
Well, we both care for Rachel, but what you're doing has to be beyond that.

1063
01:40:09,668 --> 01:40:12,603
不要带上个人感情, 否则你会成为绿林大盗
lt can't be personal, or you're just a vigilante.

1064
01:40:12,771 --> 01:40:14,671
-福克斯还在这里吗? -在的, 少爷
-ls Fox still here? -Yes, sir.

1065
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:16,432
我们要把客人送走
We need to send these people away.

1066
01:40:16,609 --> 01:40:19,544
这些是布鲁斯`韦恩的客人, 你要注意自己的名声
Those are Bruce Wayne's guests. You have a name to maintain.

1067
01:40:19,712 --> 01:40:21,612
我不关心什么名声
l don't care about my name.

1068
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:24,943
这不仅是你的名声, 少爷, 还有你父亲的
lt's not just your name, sir. lt's your father's name.

1069
01:40:26,685 --> 01:40:29,051
他的名誉是他唯一所剩的东西
And it's all that's left of him.

1070
01:40:30,990 --> 01:40:32,548
别毁了它
Don't destroy it.

1071
01:40:47,873 --> 01:40:50,034
-厄尔先生 -布鲁斯, 生日快乐
-Mr. Earle. -Happy birthday, Bruce.

1072
01:40:50,209 --> 01:40:51,642
谢谢
Thank you.

1073
01:40:51,910 --> 01:40:53,969
股票现在怎样了?
How did the stock offering go?

1074
01:40:54,213 --> 01:40:55,441
价格高升
Prices soared.

1075
01:40:55,614 --> 01:40:56,842
谁在买?
Who was buying?

1076
01:40:57,016 --> 01:40:58,950
所有的基金和经纪人都买
All kinds of funds and brokerages.

1077
01:40:59,118 --> 01:41:00,813
说起来比较专业
lt's a bit technical.

1078
01:41:00,986 --> 01:41:02,681
你要知道的就是
The key thing is...

1079
01:41:02,855 --> 01:41:07,656
我们公司的未来已经高枕无忧了
...our company's future is secure. Great.

1080
01:41:21,473 --> 01:41:23,737
她只是喝高了
A little the worse for wear, l'm afraid.

1081
01:41:29,481 --> 01:41:31,244
克莱恩, 你们的计划是什么?
What was the plan, Crane?

1082
01:41:31,417 --> 01:41:33,681
你们打算怎么把毒气放到空气中?
How were you gonna get your toxin into the air?

1083
01:41:34,053 --> 01:41:37,352
稻草人, 稻草人
Scarecrow. Scarecrow.

1084
01:41:37,523 --> 01:41:39,354
克莱恩, 你在为谁卖命?
Who were you working for, Crane?

1085
01:41:41,427 --> 01:41:43,622
太迟了
Oh, it's too late.

1086
01:41:44,229 --> 01:41:46,356
你们现在什么也阻止不了
You can't stop it now.

1087
01:41:51,403 --> 01:41:52,927
拿着
Here.

1088
01:41:53,105 --> 01:41:55,096
-布鲁斯, 生日快乐 -谢了, 谢谢
-Happy birthday, Bruce. -Thank you. Thanks.

1089
01:41:55,273 --> 01:41:58,208
多谢你的解毒剂
And thank you for that item.

1090
01:41:59,712 --> 01:42:00,940
客气
You're welcome.

1091
01:42:01,113 --> 01:42:03,911
-我知道你会好好利用它 -我已经这么办了
-l know you'll put it to good use. -l already have.

1092
01:42:04,183 --> 01:42:08,017
大批量生产要多久?
How long would it take to manufacture on a large scale?

1093
01:42:08,554 --> 01:42:09,646
几周, 怎么了?
Weeks. Why?

1094
01:42:09,822 --> 01:42:12,985
有人打算从供水系统中使用这些毒气
Somebody's planning to disperse the toxin using the water supply.

1095
01:42:13,992 --> 01:42:17,086
这毒气从水里是吸收不了的
The water supply won't help you disperse an inhalant.

1096
01:42:18,030 --> 01:42:19,429
什么?
What?

1097
01:42:19,598 --> 01:42:22,089
除非你有一个强大的微波发射器
Unless you have a microwave emitter powerful enough...

1098
01:42:22,267 --> 01:42:25,202
把水蒸发到空气中
...to vaporize all the water in the mains.

1099
01:42:25,604 --> 01:42:28,903
一个像韦恩企业刚刚丢失的微波发射器
A microwave emitter like the one Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.

1100
01:42:29,307 --> 01:42:30,535
丢失?
Misplaced?

1101
01:42:30,709 --> 01:42:34,167
我因为问问题太多, 厄尔刚刚炒了我
Earle just fired me for asking too many questions about it.

1102
01:42:36,215 --> 01:42:39,707
回到韦恩企业里, 马上量产解毒剂吧
Go back to Wayne Enterprises now and start making more of that antidote.

1103
01:42:39,885 --> 01:42:42,945
警察们马上就会需要, 越多越好
The police are gonna need as much as they can get their hands on.

1104
01:42:43,122 --> 01:42:45,249
我的员工卡已经被收回了
My security clearance has been revoked.

1105
01:42:45,424 --> 01:42:47,415
这不能阻止像你这样的人, 对吗?
That wouldn't stop a man like you, would it?

1106
01:42:47,826 --> 01:42:49,555
我看也是
l suppose not.

1107
01:42:51,596 --> 01:42:56,260
-布鲁斯, 有个人你必须要见一见 -现在不行, 夫人
-Bruce, there's somebody you must meet. -Not now, Mrs. Delane.

1108
01:42:56,435 --> 01:42:59,302
不知道我拼的对不对
Now, am l pronouncing this right...

1109
01:42:59,471 --> 01:43:01,939
忍者大师先生?
...Mr. Ra's al Ghul?

1110
01:43:07,546 --> 01:43:09,343
你不是忍者大师
You're not Ra's al Ghul.

1111
01:43:10,883 --> 01:43:12,180
我看着他死的
l watched him die.

1112
01:43:12,351 --> 01:43:15,411
或许忍者大师死不了的?
But is Ra's al Ghul immortal?

1113
01:43:18,157 --> 01:43:20,625
而且他有超能力?
Are his methods supernatural?

1114
01:43:25,164 --> 01:43:29,567
又或者你才是真正的忍者大师?
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal your true identity, Ra's?

1115
01:43:31,436 --> 01:43:35,930
当然, 一个晚上在屋顶上飞跃的人
Surely a man who spends his nights scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...

1116
01:43:36,108 --> 01:43:38,133
不会羡慕我这种双重身份的了
...wouldn't begrudge me dual identities.

1117
01:43:38,977 --> 01:43:40,774
我救了你一命
l saved your life.

1118
01:43:40,946 --> 01:43:43,437
我警告过你不要怜悯, 布鲁斯
l warned you about compassion, Bruce.

1119
01:43:46,585 --> 01:43:48,815
你我的恩怨我们自己解决
Your quarrel is with me.

1120
01:43:49,688 --> 01:43:52,179
放过这些人
You let these people go.

1121
01:43:52,424 --> 01:43:55,723
你完全可以给他们解释下他们的处境
You are welcome to explain the situation to them.

1122
01:43:57,996 --> 01:43:59,623
大家
Everyone.

1123
01:44:00,399 --> 01:44:02,299
各位?
Everybody?

1124
01:44:04,870 --> 01:44:06,735
我...
l....

1125
01:44:07,206 --> 01:44:11,438
我很感激大家今晚能来喝光我的酒
l want to thank you all for coming here tonight and drinking all of my booze.

1126
01:44:13,545 --> 01:44:15,240
我说真的
No, really.

1127
01:44:16,281 --> 01:44:19,045
做为一个如韦恩这样的人
There's a thing about being a Wayne...

1128
01:44:19,218 --> 01:44:22,779
你的豪宅里, 总是不缺那些揩油的客人
...that you're never short of a few freeloaders, like yourselves...

1129
01:44:22,954 --> 01:44:26,651
正如你们, 在此, 我感谢各位
...to fill up your mansion with. So here's to you people. Thank you.

1130
01:44:26,825 --> 01:44:29,419
-够了, 布鲁斯 -我还没说完
-That's enough, Bruce. -l'm not finished.

1131
01:44:29,761 --> 01:44:31,456
敬各位
To all of you....

1132
01:44:31,630 --> 01:44:36,033
你们这些假惺惺的, 两面派朋友们
All of you phonies, all of you two-faced friends...

1133
01:44:36,201 --> 01:44:41,264
在我面前嬉笑盈盈, 阿谀奉承的马屁精们
...you sycophantic suck-ups who smile through your teeth at me...

1134
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:45,035
求你们了, 让我安静下吧
...please, leave me in peace.

1135
01:44:45,210 --> 01:44:47,838
请走吧
Please go.

1136
01:44:48,180 --> 01:44:51,581
别笑了, 这不是笑话, 请走吧
Stop smiling, it's not a joke. Please leave.

1137
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:53,945
派对结束, 走吧
The party's over, get out.

1138
01:44:54,119 --> 01:44:57,384
韦恩先生, 你太不像你的父亲了
The apple has fallen very far from the tree, Mr. Wayne.

1139
01:45:01,927 --> 01:45:04,157
他怎么变得这么混蛋
He's turning into a jerk.

1140
01:45:10,802 --> 01:45:12,565
很有意思
Amusing.

1141
01:45:12,871 --> 01:45:16,307
但毫无意义, 所有这些人都命不久矣
But pointless. None of these people have long to live.

1142
01:45:16,475 --> 01:45:19,967
你在精神病院里的滑稽表演让我不得不亲力亲为
Your antics at the asylum have forced my hand.

1143
01:45:20,145 --> 01:45:22,306
克莱恩果然是为你卖命
So Crane was working for you.

1144
01:45:22,481 --> 01:45:26,315
他的迷幻剂产自我们的蓝色花朵
His toxin is derived from the organic compound found in our blue flowers.

1145
01:45:26,651 --> 01:45:28,710
他可以把它武器化
He was able to weaponize it.

1146
01:45:28,887 --> 01:45:30,855
他不是影武者联盟成员?
He's not a member of the League of Shadows?

1147
01:45:31,023 --> 01:45:35,585
当然不是, 他以为我们是要抢劫整个城市
Of course not. He thought our plan was to hold the city to ransom.

1148
01:45:36,294 --> 01:45:40,822
但是, 你们的确要克莱恩把毒气释放
But really, you are gonna release Crane's poison on the entire city.

1149
01:45:40,999 --> 01:45:45,026
然后看着歌谭市被恐惧毁灭
Then watch Gotham tear itself apart through fear.

1150
01:45:57,916 --> 01:45:59,816
你们会杀死成千上万的生命
You're gonna destroy millions of lives.

1151
01:46:00,018 --> 01:46:03,351
韦恩, 只有愤世嫉俗者才把这些人叫做生命
Only a cynical man would call what these people have ''lives,'' Wayne.

1152
01:46:03,522 --> 01:46:05,353
犯罪, 绝望
Crime. Despair.

1153
01:46:05,524 --> 01:46:07,617
一个人不应该活在这样的生命里
This is not how man was supposed to live.

1154
01:46:08,260 --> 01:46:11,388
千百年来, 影武者联盟
The League of Shadows has been a check against human corruption...

1155
01:46:11,563 --> 01:46:13,053
一直在留意并清洗人类的堕落
...for thousands of years.

1156
01:46:13,231 --> 01:46:16,826
我们用装着瘟疫的贸易船, 毁掉了罗马
We sacked Rome. Loaded trade ships with plague rats.

1157
01:46:17,002 --> 01:46:18,401
用火把伦敦夷为平地
Burned London to the ground.

1158
01:46:18,570 --> 01:46:21,403
每一次一个文明达到了其腐朽的顶点
Every time a civilization reaches the pinnacle of its decadence...

1159
01:46:21,573 --> 01:46:23,541
我们就会给它带来平衡
...we return to restore the balance.

1160
01:46:23,709 --> 01:46:25,301
歌谭还有得救
Gotham isn't beyond saving.

1161
01:46:26,611 --> 01:46:29,307
给我点时间, 这里还是有好人的
Give me more time. There are good people here.

1162
01:46:29,481 --> 01:46:34,646
你维护的这个城市极度腐朽, 我们已渗入进了它每一处根基
You are defending a city so corrupt we have infiltrated every level of its infrastructure.

1163
01:46:45,731 --> 01:46:47,130
该玩游戏了
Time to play.

1164
01:46:51,303 --> 01:46:53,965
当我在监狱里发现你, 你失去了自我
When l found you in that jail, you were lost.

1165
01:46:54,139 --> 01:46:56,232
但我对你心存希望
But l believed in you.

1166
01:46:56,408 --> 01:47:00,174
我驱散了你的恐惧, 给你指明道路
l took away your fear, and l showed you a path.

1167
01:47:00,412 --> 01:47:02,676
你曾是我最好的学生
You were my greatest student.

1168
01:47:02,948 --> 01:47:06,111
你应该站在我这边, 助我拯救世界
lt should be you standing by my side, saving the world.

1169
01:47:06,918 --> 01:47:09,546
我站在属于我的城市这边
l'll be standing where l belong.

1170
01:47:10,188 --> 01:47:13,316
在你和歌谭市民的中间
Between you and the people of Gotham.

1171
01:47:14,993 --> 01:47:17,587
谁也救不了歌谭
No one can save Gotham.

1172
01:47:20,932 --> 01:47:25,596
当森林扩展的太疯狂, 野火是不可避免也很自然的
When a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural.

1173
01:47:26,805 --> 01:47:31,469
明天整个世界将在惊恐中看到, 伟大的城市如何自我毁灭
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror as its greatest city destroys itself.

1174
01:47:32,044 --> 01:47:35,275
这回所带来的和谐将不再受阻挡
The movement back to harmony will be unstoppable this time.

1175
01:47:35,580 --> 01:47:37,775
-你之前袭击过歌谭? -当然
-You attacked Gotham before? -Of course.

1176
01:47:38,016 --> 01:47:40,644
几个世纪来我们掌握的武器越来越精密
Over the ages our weapons have grown more sophisticated.

1177
01:47:40,819 --> 01:47:43,720
对歌谭, 我们用过最先进的, 经济萧条
With Gotham we tried a new one. Economics.

1178
01:47:44,122 --> 01:47:48,821
但我们低估了歌谭市某些人的能力
But we underestimated certain of Gotham's citizens...

1179
01:47:49,261 --> 01:47:51,456
比如你父母这样的
...such as your parents.

1180
01:47:55,534 --> 01:47:58,992
他们却被自己所帮助的人所杀
Gunned down by one of the very people they were trying to help.

1181
01:47:57,969 --> 01:48:02,069
Create enough hunger and everyone becomes a criminal.

1182
01:47:59,969 --> 01:48:02,069
于是饥荒频发, 所有人都成了罪犯

1183
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:04,708
好人的死宣告了这城市虚伪的自救
Their deaths galvanized the city into saving itself...

1184
01:48:04,876 --> 01:48:07,572
歌谭从此已变得羸弱不堪
...and Gotham has limped on ever since.

1185
01:48:07,746 --> 01:48:09,509
我们来给它最后一击
We are back to finish the job.

1186
01:48:10,248 --> 01:48:13,479
而这次不会有迷糊的理想主义者挡我们的路了
And this time no misguided idealists will get in the way.

1187
01:48:13,652 --> 01:48:17,247
就像你父亲, 你缺乏行必行之事的勇气
Like your father, you lack the courage to do all that is necessary.

1188
01:48:17,522 --> 01:48:20,423
如果某人阻挡你行使正义
lf someone stands in the way of true justice...

1189
01:48:20,592 --> 01:48:24,653
你只需要在背后插他们一刀
...you simply walk up behind them and stab them in the heart.

1190
01:48:29,668 --> 01:48:31,829
-我要阻止你 -你始终学不会
-l am gonna stop you. -You never did learn...

1191
01:48:32,002 --> 01:48:34,027
耳听六路, 眼观八方
...to mind your surroundings.

1192
01:48:36,241 --> 01:48:38,232
正义就是平衡
Justice is balance.

1193
01:48:38,410 --> 01:48:40,571
你烧了我的房子, 杀了我的人
You burned my house and left me for dead.

1194
01:48:43,248 --> 01:48:45,375
咱俩扯平了
Consider us even.

1195
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:03,529
确保没人走得出去
No one comes out. Make sure.

1196
01:49:13,411 --> 01:49:14,878
全跑了?
They're all gone?

1197
01:49:15,045 --> 01:49:17,809
-有多少极重犯逃走? -全部
-How many from maximum security? -Every one of them.

1198
01:49:17,983 --> 01:49:19,746
连环杀手, 强奸犯
Serial killers, rapists.

1199
01:49:19,985 --> 01:49:22,818
升起吊桥, 别让任何人逃出这个岛
Raise the bridges. We don't want any getting off the island.

1200
01:49:22,988 --> 01:49:24,421
好, 等我把所有可用部队都泡派过去抓重犯
Yeah, l'll raise the bridges...

1201
01:49:24,589 --> 01:49:28,855
我就升起吊桥
...when l get every available unit out here to catch the homicidal maniacs...

1202
01:49:29,027 --> 01:49:31,928
-他们到处都是! -快点!
-...that are running loose out there. -Come on!

1203
01:49:55,086 --> 01:49:57,850
我希望你不是消防队的
l hope you're not a member of the fire brigade.

1204
01:50:03,862 --> 01:50:05,955
少爷! 少爷!
Master Wayne! Master Wayne!

1205
01:50:10,502 --> 01:50:14,871
你成天都是怎么锻炼身体的, 连个木头都抬不起?
What is the point of all those pushups if you can't even lift a bloody log?

1206
01:50:53,310 --> 01:50:55,403
我干了什么, 阿福?
What have l done, Alfred?

1207
01:50:56,414 --> 01:50:58,348
我家族的一切
Everything my family...

1208
01:50:58,516 --> 01:51:00,450
我父亲所建的...
...my father, built....

1209
01:51:02,821 --> 01:51:06,757
少爷, 韦恩的遗产不体现在这些砖瓦中
The Wayne legacy is more than bricks and mortar, sir.

1210
01:51:06,925 --> 01:51:09,155
我只是想救歌谭
l wanted to save Gotham.

1211
01:51:09,995 --> 01:51:11,895
我失败了
l failed.

1212
01:51:13,098 --> 01:51:14,395
少爷, 为什么我们会跌倒?
Why do we fall, sir?

1213
01:51:17,569 --> 01:51:21,027
这样我们才能学着站起来
So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.

1214
01:51:23,508 --> 01:51:25,669
还是没放弃我是吗?
You still haven't given up on me?

1215
01:51:27,579 --> 01:51:29,069
从来没
Never.

1216
01:51:30,115 --> 01:51:31,446
趴下!
Down!

1217
01:51:31,616 --> 01:51:34,551
恶意行为, 警察恶意行为!
Harassment! l see harassment!

1218
01:51:34,719 --> 01:51:36,744
我给你看看什么叫恶意行为?
Maybe you'd like to see some excessive force?

1219
01:51:36,921 --> 01:51:38,855
带枪的疯子
Madman with a gun.

1220
01:51:40,091 --> 01:51:43,288
警察们使用空前的武力搜捕越狱逃犯
With residents furious at the unprecedented show of police strength...

1221
01:51:43,461 --> 01:51:44,951
...让市民们不胜其烦
-...to round up the inmates....

1222
01:51:45,130 --> 01:51:46,961
我们准备要升起吊桥
We're about to raise these bridges.

1223
01:51:47,132 --> 01:51:50,727
警官, 我是歌谭市检察官, 让我过去
Officer, l am a Gotham City district attorney. Let me pass.

1224
01:51:58,143 --> 01:52:00,441
-闭嘴! -弗拉斯, 冷静!
-Just shut up! -Hey, Flass, cool it!

1225
01:52:00,612 --> 01:52:01,874
把这些人赶回去
Hold these people back.

1226
01:52:02,047 --> 01:52:05,039
戈登, 有人找你
Hey, Gordon. Somebody here to see you.

1227
01:52:05,216 --> 01:52:07,582
-你来这里干什么? -我们的朋友给你带来这个
-What are you doing here? -Our friend sent me with this.

1228
01:52:07,752 --> 01:52:09,276
这会中和克莱恩的毒素
lt counteracts Crane's toxin.

1229
01:52:09,454 --> 01:52:10,921
希望你不会用得上
Hopefully you won't need it.

1230
01:52:11,089 --> 01:52:14,252
除非他把这毒气放到空气中
Not unless he's got some way of getting that crap into the air.

1231
01:52:15,393 --> 01:52:17,861
好了, 最后一个过桥
All right, last one across.

1232
01:52:18,530 --> 01:52:22,466
快! 他们三分钟内就要升起桥了!
Come on, people, they want this bridge up in no more than three minutes!

1233
01:52:22,666 --> 01:52:26,033
你最好在桥升起前离开这座岛, 巡警!
Better get you off the island before they raise the bridges. Patrolman!

1234
01:52:26,670 --> 01:52:27,659
走!
Go!

1235
01:52:54,499 --> 01:52:56,330
我找不到我妈妈
l can't find my mom.

1236
01:52:56,634 --> 01:52:58,158
 
Hey!

1237
01:53:06,544 --> 01:53:08,273
你干什么呢?
What the hell are you doing?

1238
01:53:09,781 --> 01:53:11,373
先生们
Gentlemen...

1239
01:53:11,783 --> 01:53:14,343
是时候发出我们的宣言了
...time to spread the word.

1240
01:53:16,054 --> 01:53:17,453
这宣言就是
And the word is...

1241
01:53:18,723 --> 01:53:20,452
恐慌
...panic.

1242
01:53:43,314 --> 01:53:44,372
 


1243
01:53:44,549 --> 01:53:46,141
天哪, 压力正在骤增
Jesus. The pressure, it's spiking.

1244
01:53:47,152 --> 01:53:48,483
在这里
Right there.

1245
01:53:48,787 --> 01:53:51,051
总水管就在奈何岛下面
That water main is right under the Narrows.

1246
01:54:07,972 --> 01:54:09,530
没事的
lt's okay.

1247
01:54:42,373 --> 01:54:43,931
我是罗伯局长
This is Commissioner Loeb.

1248
01:54:44,108 --> 01:54:45,803
有人回话吗
Come on, somebody talk to me.

1249
01:54:45,976 --> 01:54:47,443
回话!
Come on!

1250
01:55:07,098 --> 01:55:09,157
罗伯, 罗伯, 我是戈登
Loeb, Loeb. This is Gordon.

1251
01:55:09,434 --> 01:55:10,799
到底那边怎么了?
What the hell is going on?

1252
01:55:10,969 --> 01:55:14,405
我们需要支援, 霹雳小组, 特警, 防暴警察!
We need reinforcements. TAC teams, SWAT, riot cops!

1253
01:55:14,572 --> 01:55:18,804
戈登, 这个城市所有的防暴警察都在你那边了!
Gordon! All the city's riot police are on the island with you!

1254
01:55:18,977 --> 01:55:21,002
他们完全没用!
Well, they're completely incapacitated!

1255
01:55:21,312 --> 01:55:25,271
没事, 没事的, 他们伤害不了你
lt's okay, it's okay. No one's gonna hurt you.

1256
01:55:26,150 --> 01:55:27,777
他们当然可以
Of course they are!

1257
01:55:27,986 --> 01:55:30,955
-克莱恩? -不. 稻草人
-Crane? -No. Scarecrow.

1258
01:55:32,724 --> 01:55:34,123
戈登
Gordon...

1259
01:55:34,291 --> 01:55:36,555
我们已经没有人手了
...there's nobody left to send in.

1260
01:55:38,096 --> 01:55:39,791
我在孤军奋战?
So l'm on my own?

1261
01:55:43,902 --> 01:55:45,563
奈何岛现在一片乱七八糟
The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces.

1262
01:55:45,737 --> 01:55:48,331
这只是开始, 如果扩散到整个城市
This is just the beginning. lf they hit the whole city...

1263
01:55:48,506 --> 01:55:51,236
就没有人能让歌谭免于自我毁灭
...there's nothing to stop Gotham tearing itself apart.

1264
01:55:51,409 --> 01:55:53,309
-他们打算怎么做? -轻轨电车
-How are they gonna do that? -The train.

1265
01:55:53,478 --> 01:55:57,312
轨道是随着水管一起的, 终点会抵达韦恩大厦
The monorail follows the water mains to the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.

1266
01:55:57,482 --> 01:55:59,211
如果微波发射器抵达终点
If the machine gets to the station...

1267
01:55:59,384 --> 01:56:02,842
会引发连锁反应, 蒸发掉全城的供水
...it'll cause a chain reaction that'll vaporize the city's water supply.

1268
01:56:03,021 --> 01:56:04,613
全城都会中毒
Covering Gotham in this poison.

1269
01:56:04,789 --> 01:56:07,986
我要去阻止他把机器装上车, 但我需要你帮忙
l'm gonna stop him from loading that train, but l may need your help.

1270
01:56:08,159 --> 01:56:09,956
-怎么做? -你会不会开手排档?
-What do you need? -Can you drive stick?

1271
01:56:16,234 --> 01:56:17,895
你在这!
There you are!

1272
01:56:18,069 --> 01:56:20,060
除了恐惧本身
There is nothing to fear...

1273
01:56:20,238 --> 01:56:21,967
其它一切都不足惧!
...but fear itself!

1274
01:56:23,041 --> 01:56:25,373
我是来帮忙的!
l am here to help!

1275
01:56:56,574 --> 01:56:58,735
蝙蝠侠会救我们, 他会来的
Batman will save us. He'll come.

1276
01:57:03,948 --> 01:57:05,848
-他会来的 -别看
-He'll come. -Don't peek.

1277
01:57:14,492 --> 01:57:17,859
我是戈登, 准备放下吊桥
This is Gordon. Prepare to lower the bridge.

1278
01:57:23,735 --> 01:57:25,862
我说过他会来的
l told you he'd come.

1279
01:57:30,875 --> 01:57:32,502
等等
Wait.

1280
01:57:33,478 --> 01:57:35,070
你可能会送命
You could die.

1281
01:57:35,246 --> 01:57:36,543
至少告诉我你的名字
At least tell me your name.

1282
01:57:41,952 --> 01:57:44,147
我外表底下是谁不重要
lt's not who l am underneath...

1283
01:57:45,123 --> 01:57:47,819
决定自身的是我的所作所为
...but what l do that defines me.

1284
01:57:49,794 --> 01:57:51,091
布鲁斯?
Bruce?

1285
01:58:24,796 --> 01:58:28,163
哈, 关于我那戏剧效果的建议, 你还很认真
Well, well. You took my advice about theatricality a bit literally.

1286
01:58:28,332 --> 01:58:30,800
-你的诡计结束了 -结束的是你们
-lt ends here. -For you and the police, maybe.

1287
01:58:30,968 --> 01:58:33,300
我的战斗, 看到歌谭完蛋前不会结束
My fight, however, lies with the rest of Gotham.

1288
01:58:33,471 --> 01:58:36,838
请原谅, 我要去摧毁一个城市
Now, if you'll excuse me, l have a city to destroy.

1289
01:58:37,007 --> 01:58:40,704
-我打不过你的两个爪牙? -随你便
-l can't beat two of your pawns? -As you wish.

1290
01:58:53,524 --> 01:58:55,822
启动GPS
GPS online.

1291
01:59:02,666 --> 01:59:04,896
距离100码
In 1 00 yards.

1292
01:59:35,767 --> 01:59:37,064
先生们
Gentlemen.

1293
02:00:04,462 --> 02:00:06,692
是谁允许放桥的?
Who the hell authorized this?

1294
02:00:17,241 --> 02:00:19,334
距离韦恩大厦, 3英里
Distance to Wayne Tower, three miles.

1295
02:00:26,584 --> 02:00:29,212
压力随着主管道, 一直沿着管子炸开
The pressure's moving along the mains, blowing the pipes.

1296
02:00:29,387 --> 02:00:30,752
如果压力抵达这里
lf that pressure reaches us...

1297
02:00:30,922 --> 02:00:33,948
整个城市的供水都要炸开!
...the water supply right across the whole city is gonna blow!

1298
02:00:44,402 --> 02:00:47,303
下个路口右转
At the next intersection, turn right.

1299
02:01:11,996 --> 02:01:13,429
你总是学不会
You will never learn.

1300
02:01:21,038 --> 02:01:22,027
抱歉
Sorry.

1301
02:01:26,010 --> 02:01:28,979
-领教过了, 你就没什么新招数? -这个怎么样!
-Familiar. Don't you have anything new? -How about this?!

1302
02:01:45,763 --> 02:01:48,061
你已抵达韦恩大厦
You have arrived at Wayne Tower.

1303
02:02:01,345 --> 02:02:02,607
撤出大楼
Evacuate the building.

1304
02:02:02,813 --> 02:02:05,304
我们是在一个大锅盖顶上, 它要爆炸了!!
We're on top of the main hub and it's gonna blow.

1305
02:02:14,225 --> 02:02:16,420
启动武器系统
Weapons system activated.

1306
02:02:20,498 --> 02:02:21,487
车真炫
Nice ride.

1307
02:02:36,781 --> 02:02:37,770
装弹
Armed.

1308
02:02:44,288 --> 02:02:45,516
 


1309
02:02:49,727 --> 02:02:51,194
别害怕, 布鲁斯
Don't be afraid, Bruce.

1310
02:02:53,998 --> 02:02:55,363
快, 快
Come on. Come on.

1311
02:03:00,137 --> 02:03:02,196
你只是个普通人
You are just an ordinary man in a cape.

1312
02:03:02,373 --> 02:03:06,241
正因如此, 你无法战胜邪恶, 无法阻止列车
That's why you couldn't fight injustice, that's why you can't stop this train.

1313
02:03:06,410 --> 02:03:09,004
谁说我要阻止它?
Who said anything about stopping it?

1314
02:03:14,819 --> 02:03:16,343
好!
Yes!

1315
02:03:24,528 --> 02:03:27,964
你总学不会留意周围!
You never learned to mind your surroundings!

1316
02:03:35,773 --> 02:03:38,264
你终于学会行必行之事了吗?
Have you finally learned to do what is necessary?

1317
02:03:38,576 --> 02:03:40,874
我不会杀你
l won't kill you...

1318
02:03:45,316 --> 02:03:47,477
但也不必救你
...but l don't have to save you.

1319
02:05:02,626 --> 02:05:05,686
-会议已经开始了 -什么会议?
-The meeting's already started. -What meeting?

1320
02:05:09,967 --> 02:05:12,868
福克斯, 我记得我已经炒了你
Fox, l seem to remember firing you.

1321
02:05:13,404 --> 02:05:14,962
没错
You did.

1322
02:05:15,139 --> 02:05:17,232
我又得到另一份工作了
l got another job.

1323
02:05:18,075 --> 02:05:19,508
你的工作
Yours.

1324
02:05:19,977 --> 02:05:21,672
谁允许的?
On whose authority?

1325
02:05:22,313 --> 02:05:24,247
蝙蝠侠又上头条了
Batman may have made the front page...

1326
02:05:24,448 --> 02:05:27,349
不过布鲁斯`韦恩被推到了第八页
...but Bruce Wayne got pushed to page eight.

1327
02:05:29,887 --> 02:05:33,550
"醉酒亿万富翁烧掉豪宅"


1328
02:05:34,225 --> 02:05:35,214
布鲁斯`韦恩
Bruce Wayne.

1329
02:05:35,391 --> 02:05:39,157
谁给你权力决定管理公司的人选?
What makes you think you can decide who's running Wayne Enterprises?

1330
02:05:39,330 --> 02:05:42,060
-实际上我才是老总 -你在说什么?
-The fact that l'm the owner. -What are you talking about?

1331
02:05:42,333 --> 02:05:44,233
公司一周前已经上市了
The company went public a week ago.

1332
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:45,867
我通过各种慈善基金和信托
And l bought most of the shares.

1333
02:05:46,237 --> 02:05:49,695
买下了大部分股权
Through various charitable foundations and trusts and so forth.

1334
02:05:49,874 --> 02:05:53,071
说起来比较专业, 你需要知道的是
Look, it's all a bit technical, but the important thing...

1335
02:05:53,310 --> 02:05:56,609
我公司的未来已经高枕无忧了
...is that my company's future is secure.

1336
02:05:56,981 --> 02:05:58,380
对吗, 福克斯先生?
Right, Mr. Fox?

1337
02:05:58,549 --> 02:06:00,380
一点没错, 韦恩先生
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.

1338
02:06:02,586 --> 02:06:04,178
你没收到通知吗?
Didn't you get the memo?

1339
02:06:23,107 --> 02:06:26,304
-抱歉没告诉你, 瑞秋 -不, 不, 布鲁斯
-l'm sorry l didn't tell you, Rachel. -No. No, Bruce...

1340
02:06:26,510 --> 02:06:27,875
我很抱歉
...l'm sorry.

1341
02:06:28,746 --> 02:06:31,408
杀你父亲的凶手死那天
The day that Chill died, l....

1342
02:06:33,284 --> 02:06:34,911
我对你说了重话
l said terrible things.

1343
02:06:35,419 --> 02:06:37,182
但你说的对
But true things.

1344
02:06:37,821 --> 02:06:39,652
我当时只是个拿枪的懦夫
l was a coward with a gun...

1345
02:06:39,823 --> 02:06:43,589
而正义不仅仅是复仇, 谢谢你
...and justice is about more than revenge, so thank you.

1346
02:06:44,662 --> 02:06:47,324
我一直都在想念你
l never stopped thinking about you.

1347
02:06:48,799 --> 02:06:50,426
想念我们
About us.

1348
02:06:51,068 --> 02:06:53,036
当我知道你回来了, 我...
And when l heard you were back, l....

1349
02:06:53,871 --> 02:06:56,066
我开始希望
l started to hope.

1350
02:07:20,130 --> 02:07:22,826
但后来我发现了你的面具
But then l found out about your mask.

1351
02:07:24,033 --> 02:07:26,831
蝙蝠侠只是个象征, 瑞秋
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.

1352
02:07:27,471 --> 02:07:29,132
不, 这
No. This...

1353
02:07:30,307 --> 02:07:32,002
这就是你的面具
...is your mask.

1354
02:07:33,978 --> 02:07:37,539
现在, 真正的你才是让恶人最惧怕的
Your real face is the one that criminals now fear.

1355
02:07:38,382 --> 02:07:40,350
而那个我爱的人
The man l loved...

1356
02:07:41,085 --> 02:07:42,518
那个曾消失了的人
...the man who vanished...

1357
02:07:43,754 --> 02:07:45,881
从来没有回来过
...he never came back at all.

1358
02:07:50,394 --> 02:07:53,022
但也许他还在某处
But maybe he's still out there somewhere.

1359
02:07:55,232 --> 02:07:58,895
也许有一天, 当歌谭市不再需要蝙蝠侠
Maybe someday, when Gotham no longer needs Batman...

1360
02:07:59,970 --> 02:08:01,938
我会再见到你
...l'll see him again.

1361
02:08:12,983 --> 02:08:15,884
-知道吗, 这证明我错了 -什么错了?
-Proved me wrong, you know. -About what?

1362
02:08:18,721 --> 02:08:21,189
你父亲会为你而骄傲
Your father would be very proud of you.

1363
02:08:21,425 --> 02:08:23,017
像我一样
Just like me.

1364
02:08:50,019 --> 02:08:51,884
你打算怎么办?
What will you do?

1365
02:08:53,290 --> 02:08:54,848
重建家园
Rebuild it.

1366
02:08:55,726 --> 02:08:58,092
像以前一样, 一砖一瓦
Just the way it was, brick for brick.

1367
02:09:04,935 --> 02:09:06,197
像以前一样, 少爷?
Just the way it was, sir?

1368
02:09:08,305 --> 02:09:09,533
对, 怎么?
Yeah, why?

1369
02:09:09,707 --> 02:09:12,540
我觉得这次是个绝好的机会
l thought this might be a good opportunity for...

1370
02:09:12,710 --> 02:09:15,178
我们可以加强地基
...improving the foundations.

1371
02:09:15,346 --> 02:09:18,315
-你是说东南角的地基? -正确, 少爷
-ln the southeast corner? -Precisely, sir.

1372
02:09:33,997 --> 02:09:36,830
-不错 -我找不到黑帮老大绑在上边
-Nice. -l couldn't find any mob bosses.

1373
02:09:37,768 --> 02:09:40,498
-有事吗, 警官? -现在是警长了
-Well, sergeant? -lt's ''lieutenant'' now.

1374
02:09:40,838 --> 02:09:42,328
你真的改变了些东西
You really started something.

1375
02:09:42,539 --> 02:09:44,507
坏警察现在不敢乱来
Bent cops running scared.

1376
02:09:44,675 --> 02:09:46,108
人们又有了希望
Hope on the streets.

1377
02:09:46,342 --> 02:09:49,937
-但是? -奈何岛还没清理好
-But? -The Narrows is lost.

1378
02:09:50,481 --> 02:09:54,349
我们也没抓到克莱恩和他的手下
And we still haven't picked up Crane or half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.

1379
02:09:54,985 --> 02:09:56,612
我们会的
We will.

1380
02:09:56,854 --> 02:09:58,515
我们能够拯救歌谭
We can bring Gotham back.

1381
02:09:58,689 --> 02:10:01,180
-升级效应呢? -升级效应?
-What about escalation? -Escalation?

1382
02:10:01,357 --> 02:10:05,657
我们开始装备半自动步枪, 敌人就用自动步枪
We start carrying semiautomatics, they buy automatics.

1383
02:10:05,829 --> 02:10:10,198
我们开始穿盔甲, 敌人就用穿甲弹
We start wearing Kevlar, they buy armor-piercing rounds.

1384
02:10:10,366 --> 02:10:13,631
-然后呢? -然后, 你带着面具
-And? -And you're wearing a mask...

1385
02:10:14,071 --> 02:10:16,005
在屋顶上翻飞
...and jumping off rooftops.

1386
02:10:17,373 --> 02:10:19,398
而这家伙, 比方说
Now, take this guy.

1387
02:10:19,643 --> 02:10:21,702
武装抢劫, 杀人放火
Armed robbery, double homicide.

1388
02:10:21,879 --> 02:10:25,110
和你一样, 喜欢带来戏剧效果
Got a taste for the theatrical, like you.

1389
02:10:25,381 --> 02:10:27,315
每次作案都留下卡片
Leaves a calling card.

1390
02:10:29,987 --> 02:10:31,921
"小丑"  


1391
02:10:33,190 --> 02:10:35,021
我去查查
l'll look into it.

1392
02:10:38,495 --> 02:10:40,019
我还从没谢过你
l never said thank you.

1393
02:10:45,068 --> 02:10:47,127
你也永远不用谢我
And you'll never have to.
