1
00:00:14,073 --> 00:00:17,910
THE SWINDLE

2
00:02:58,362 --> 00:03:01,323
Dearest Barone!

3
00:03:01,365 --> 00:03:05,369
It's 10.30.
You're always keeping me waiting.

4
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:17,506
Where have you been?

5
00:03:17,548 --> 00:03:19,675
We couldn't find Roberto.

6
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:22,970
He's got a woman in every country!

7
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:33,647
Look! How lovely!

8
00:03:34,857 --> 00:03:37,401
It's only ten kilometres.
We could have been there by now.

9
00:03:37,443 --> 00:03:39,486
Why do we always act like buffoons?

10
00:03:46,577 --> 00:03:48,746
It's like a Corot landscape.

11
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,582
Here. Go hang yourself!

12
00:03:57,588 --> 00:04:01,300
Here. This is the map.
That mark there is the tree.

13
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:04,386
Eight steps from the tree
you'll find the treasure.

14
00:04:05,554 --> 00:04:06,597
Understood.

15
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,225
What are you doing? Yellow shoes?

16
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:12,978
Who'll see them under the cassock?

17
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,147
Give me that cross.

18
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,983
There.

19
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:19,818
What are these numbers?

20
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,571
A metre and a half down. Understood?

21
00:04:22,613 --> 00:04:26,992
The earth has been smoothed over
so you can't tell the difference.

22
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:28,536
Then you just have to dig.

23
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:31,872
We can easily do it before the evening.

24
00:04:33,582 --> 00:04:39,046
Tell that idiot not to get smart
with the women - they're not stupid.

25
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:46,011
Something else I forgot.
Be careful of those two nasty dogs.

26
00:04:46,846 --> 00:04:49,306
- The ring?
- I've got it!

27
00:04:49,348 --> 00:04:52,393
What's wrong with you this morning?

28
00:04:52,476 --> 00:04:54,103
Are you on edge?

29
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:01,151
Let me have a look.
Is everything okay?

30
00:05:01,193 --> 00:05:04,154
What's up with Augusto?

31
00:05:04,196 --> 00:05:06,782
The old fool's agonising.

32
00:05:06,824 --> 00:05:09,660
Augusto? Beautiful spot, eh?

33
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:14,707
Monsignore.

34
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:21,797
Get in. We're off.

35
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,592
Good morning, signora.

36
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:08,344
Good morning.

37
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:12,181
Would you mind
calling off the dogs, please?

38
00:06:15,518 --> 00:06:16,769
Come here!

39
00:06:17,436 --> 00:06:19,021
Is Stella Fiorina here?

40
00:06:20,731 --> 00:06:22,733
Is Stella Fiorina here?

41
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:30,699
What do you want? That's me.

42
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:32,284
Monsignore, that's her.

43
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:34,995
Good morning.

44
00:06:35,037 --> 00:06:36,997
Ah! Pax et bonum.

45
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,875
A real pleasure, Signora Stella Fiorina.

46
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:42,086
You are the owner of this farm?

47
00:06:42,127 --> 00:06:45,631
We need to discuss
a confidential matter.

48
00:06:45,673 --> 00:06:48,384
His Eminence has sent,
especially from Rome,

49
00:06:48,467 --> 00:06:52,054
his referendary
Monsignor De Filippis.

50
00:07:00,104 --> 00:07:01,814
Monsignore!

51
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:17,538
We need to talk to you in private.

52
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,957
Is that possible?

53
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:30,384
Make yourself at home, Monsignore.
I'm sorry, everything's grubby here.

54
00:07:31,343 --> 00:07:32,761
You, get out!

55
00:07:32,803 --> 00:07:35,264
Excuse us, Monsignore.

56
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:37,224
- Out, out!
- Cute!

57
00:07:42,354 --> 00:07:43,564
Don Pietro.

58
00:07:44,607 --> 00:07:46,567
Can you close the door?

59
00:08:09,173 --> 00:08:12,009
On the point of death, a poor sinner

60
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:16,055
wished to disclose
a dreadful secret to us.

61
00:08:17,223 --> 00:08:19,391
It's about a murder.

62
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:23,103
During the war
when the front passed through here,

63
00:08:23,145 --> 00:08:27,816
the deceased fled with an accomplice
after committing a robbery.

64
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:30,611
He then killed his friend
and hid the corpse somewhere which,

65
00:08:30,694 --> 00:08:33,614
according to his instructions,
is on your property.

66
00:08:33,656 --> 00:08:36,200
Sorry. Is there here on your farm

67
00:08:36,242 --> 00:08:40,204
a tree in the middle of a field,
totally isolated?

68
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,123
Yes, behind the vineyard.

69
00:08:43,165 --> 00:08:45,042
That's it.

70
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:52,007
Well, it's my duty
to dig up those remains

71
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:54,760
and rebury them
in consecrated ground.

72
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:59,807
It's a virtuous deed which
I need you to help me carry out

73
00:08:59,849 --> 00:09:02,726
for the sake of
the murderer's peace of mind.

74
00:09:03,936 --> 00:09:07,356
- Is it far from here?
- No, it's beyond the vineyard.

75
00:09:07,398 --> 00:09:08,691
What do you want to do?

76
00:09:09,942 --> 00:09:11,777
Tell me,

77
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:14,405
is it a quiet place?

78
00:09:14,446 --> 00:09:17,449
I mean,
there's no risk of being seen?

79
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:21,620
I'd prefer not to wait for night
since it won't take long

80
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:25,165
and your help won't even be needed.

81
00:09:25,207 --> 00:09:26,500
The treasure.

82
00:09:29,545 --> 00:09:30,754
The treasure!

83
00:09:30,796 --> 00:09:33,382
Ah yes, yes, I was forgetting.

84
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:36,093
It would seem that by the bones

85
00:09:36,135 --> 00:09:38,512
there is some jewellery
which the two had stolen.

86
00:09:38,554 --> 00:09:41,807
Perhaps the murderer
intended to return and collect them.

87
00:09:41,891 --> 00:09:44,018
It's a little treasure trove.

88
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:46,353
Father has the complete list here.

89
00:09:46,437 --> 00:09:48,731
But this doesn't matter to us

90
00:09:48,772 --> 00:09:51,859
for the deceased expressly
stated that, if it was found,

91
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:53,819
it should remain
in the hands of the landowner...

92
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:55,988
Namely you.

93
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:00,868
...Except for a small provision
to pay for a few masses for his soul.

94
00:10:05,831 --> 00:10:08,626
You promise me
you'll keep the secret?

95
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,836
It's also in your interest.

96
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:16,133
The government could,
without right, claim the treasure.

97
00:10:16,175 --> 00:10:17,384
Treasure!

98
00:10:17,426 --> 00:10:21,514
Yes. But what we're
more concerned about

99
00:10:23,516 --> 00:10:26,060
is burying that poor body.

100
00:10:29,522 --> 00:10:31,482
This is the tree.

101
00:10:31,524 --> 00:10:34,652
Eight paces from this point
towards the vineyard.

102
00:10:34,693 --> 00:10:38,405
If I may, Monsignore,
I'd like to count them.

103
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:40,950
Pardon me, Monsignore. One moment.

104
00:10:40,991 --> 00:10:45,829
One, two, three, four, five, six,

105
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:48,082
seven, eight.

106
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:50,626
Eight...

107
00:10:52,294 --> 00:10:53,921
Monsignore!

108
00:10:54,004 --> 00:10:56,423
It should be here, right here.

109
00:10:58,217 --> 00:10:59,260
Good.

110
00:11:03,222 --> 00:11:07,893
So, shall we try? Do you agree?

111
00:11:08,727 --> 00:11:09,770
Yes.

112
00:11:10,813 --> 00:11:14,984
- Please proceed.
- The duty is mine, Monsignore.

113
00:11:19,238 --> 00:11:20,906
Look out!

114
00:11:46,015 --> 00:11:49,560
I can't take any more.
Monsignore, there's nothing here.

115
00:11:49,602 --> 00:11:52,813
- I need a rest.
- Give it to me.

116
00:11:59,737 --> 00:12:01,572
Be careful, Stella.

117
00:12:06,577 --> 00:12:08,329
Monsignore! Come here!

118
00:12:09,914 --> 00:12:12,625
Augusto, here we are.

119
00:12:15,252 --> 00:12:18,589
- Monsignore, look!
- My goodness, he was right!

120
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:21,800
Poor soul.

121
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:25,930
Just look!

122
00:12:25,971 --> 00:12:28,265
Requiem aeternam...

123
00:12:28,307 --> 00:12:32,436
Easy does it, Roberto,
give them to me. Thank you.

124
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,029
Look what we're reduced to.

125
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:44,323
Blessed Lord.

126
00:12:44,365 --> 00:12:48,619
- Look how many bones there are!
- Oh, Blessed Virgin!

127
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,705
What's this bone?

128
00:12:51,747 --> 00:12:54,375
There's something here!

129
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:58,170
Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine.

130
00:12:58,212 --> 00:12:59,255
Monsignore!

131
00:13:01,924 --> 00:13:04,802
- Monsignore, look, it's here!
- Monsignore, it's here!

132
00:13:12,518 --> 00:13:15,563
A gold necklace with diamonds,

133
00:13:15,604 --> 00:13:17,064
and rubies.

134
00:13:20,025 --> 00:13:24,947
A gold ingot weighing... two kilos.

135
00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:26,448
There we are.

136
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,034
Then a gold brooch...

137
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:31,328
But is it all decent stuff?

138
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:33,956
I wouldn't mind it!

139
00:13:33,998 --> 00:13:35,833
No, I meant, Monsignore,

140
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:39,044
if it wasn't decent stuff,
after being buried for so long

141
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:40,713
it'd be all black, wouldn't it?

142
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:44,967
I'm no expert, but I'd have thought
it'd be worth... five or six million.

143
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:46,427
How much?!

144
00:13:46,468 --> 00:13:48,345
Could I have a glass of water?

145
00:13:48,387 --> 00:13:50,431
Six million?!

146
00:13:50,472 --> 00:13:53,475
Six million, more or less.

147
00:13:53,517 --> 00:13:56,103
Even more with the rate
gold fetches at the moment.

148
00:13:56,187 --> 00:13:57,521
It's gone up, you know, Father!

149
00:13:57,563 --> 00:13:58,814
Of course. Even more.

150
00:13:58,898 --> 00:14:02,026
Definitely more.
It'd be about seven million.

151
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:05,821
- Do we have to share it with you?
- Oh, heavens, no.

152
00:14:05,863 --> 00:14:09,783
Not at all. It's yours. All yours.

153
00:14:09,825 --> 00:14:11,785
Father.

154
00:14:14,663 --> 00:14:17,458
"To whom it may concern.

155
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:22,046
"Given the excruciating remorse
induced by my evil deed,

156
00:14:22,087 --> 00:14:26,800
"and the fear of paying for my sins
in the eternal flames of hell,

157
00:14:26,842 --> 00:14:30,679
"I provide that all the wealth
I wrongfully acquired

158
00:14:30,721 --> 00:14:33,265
"and buried next
to the corpse of my victim,

159
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:35,893
"given that
the legitimate owners are dead,

160
00:14:35,935 --> 00:14:38,646
"should go to the owners of the land

161
00:14:38,687 --> 00:14:42,608
"in which it is found,
on one sole condition."

162
00:14:42,691 --> 00:14:45,694
I'm reading
the last will and testament.

163
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:50,950
"...On one sole condition:

164
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:56,872
"That the owners have 500 masses
said for the salvation of my soul."

165
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:02,211
Do we have to pay for the masses?

166
00:15:02,253 --> 00:15:05,130
Can we have them said
by our parish priest?

167
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:07,049
No, no, no.

168
00:15:07,091 --> 00:15:10,636
I'll have them said in San Pietro -
it'd be much better.

169
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:15,391
500 masses at 1,000 lire each.

170
00:15:15,432 --> 00:15:16,976
That's not exactly much!

171
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:20,062
That's 500 banknotes of 1,000 lire!

172
00:15:21,605 --> 00:15:26,360
"Should the owners
refuse this despicable gold

173
00:15:26,443 --> 00:15:31,657
"I beg His Eminency
to make a charitable donation."

174
00:15:36,662 --> 00:15:38,497
Do we have to pay it all at once?

175
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:41,458
Well, that's what's written here.

176
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:45,462
Remember.

177
00:15:45,504 --> 00:15:49,425
It's a solemn secret.
There's a murder involved.

178
00:15:49,508 --> 00:15:52,428
You too could be accused.

179
00:15:53,512 --> 00:15:56,891
- We can't give it all at once.
- We'll sell the oxen.

180
00:15:56,932 --> 00:15:58,767
- Keep quiet!
- We'll manage it!

181
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:04,190
Monsignore, we could take the ingot,
but of course it's worth a lot more.

182
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:06,358
This is at least 1 million!

183
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,570
No, absolutely not.

184
00:16:09,612 --> 00:16:11,572
We must find another way.

185
00:16:11,614 --> 00:16:15,242
Meanwhile, we'll take everything
to His Eminence in Rome.

186
00:16:15,284 --> 00:16:17,953
Don't worry, he'll find a solution.

187
00:16:17,995 --> 00:16:20,623
- Shall we go?
- Certainly, Monsignore.

188
00:16:20,664 --> 00:16:24,543
Monsignore, could you wait a moment?
I want to talk to my sister.

189
00:16:45,022 --> 00:16:47,566
Roberto, cut it out, please!

190
00:16:52,404 --> 00:16:56,033
It's already five. We should go.

191
00:16:57,076 --> 00:16:59,954
Oh, look at him! Hello, cutie.

192
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:04,792
You look like a little devil!

193
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:07,336
The ladies - where have they got to?

194
00:17:07,378 --> 00:17:10,130
They've gone to the village
in the cart.

195
00:17:13,342 --> 00:17:16,428
Why have they gone to the village?

196
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:22,476
Deceitful Monsignore,
50 years old, ends up in jail!

197
00:17:24,603 --> 00:17:27,231
He's the one who's most afraid.

198
00:17:35,364 --> 00:17:37,533
Here they are.

199
00:17:42,413 --> 00:17:43,914
There's a man, too.

200
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:56,635
We've got 400.

201
00:17:57,595 --> 00:17:58,888
425.

202
00:17:58,971 --> 00:18:02,641
- We couldn't find any more.
- Is that all right?

203
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:21,535
Thank you for everything!
May God reward you!

204
00:18:21,619 --> 00:18:24,538
- Have a good trip!
- Pax et bonum.

205
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,582
Goodbye!

206
00:18:26,624 --> 00:18:29,543
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

207
00:18:50,814 --> 00:18:52,566
Stop here. I'm getting out.

208
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:53,734
Thanks. Ciao.

209
00:18:53,776 --> 00:18:55,528
- Ciao, Picassi.
- Ciao.

210
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:58,531
- See you tomorrow. Ciao, Augusto.
- Ciao, Picassi.

211
00:19:15,214 --> 00:19:18,217
- Iris! Iris!
- Carlo!

212
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:20,636
Ciao! Dress Silvana
and come down right now.

213
00:19:20,678 --> 00:19:22,805
We'll eat out, then see a film.

214
00:19:22,847 --> 00:19:25,808
- But we were already eating!
- No, we'll go out! Hurry up!

215
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,101
Okay!

216
00:19:29,728 --> 00:19:31,689
Papà, Papà!

217
00:19:32,523 --> 00:19:34,733
Ciao, Papà! Ciao, Papà!

218
00:19:34,817 --> 00:19:37,486
My darling!

219
00:19:37,528 --> 00:19:40,197
Come here to Papà!

220
00:19:49,707 --> 00:19:53,377
Here she is, my little girl!

221
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:56,463
Give Papà a hug!

222
00:19:56,505 --> 00:19:58,757
Yesterday, a lady in Viterbo

223
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,720
asked me if I knew
a little girl called Silvana.

224
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:04,013
Me! Me!

225
00:20:04,054 --> 00:20:06,932
- Here you are!
- Oh, a green handbag!

226
00:20:09,727 --> 00:20:12,313
So many kisses for your Papà!

227
00:20:12,354 --> 00:20:15,941
Go and call your Mamma.
Tell her to come right away.

228
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:17,568
There we are.

229
00:20:22,281 --> 00:20:27,369
Look what Papà's brought me! He says
a woman from Viterbo gave it to him!

230
00:20:27,411 --> 00:20:29,455
I don't believe him.

231
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:30,664
Oh!

232
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:37,046
Hurry up and get dressed.
We're going to eat out.

233
00:20:38,631 --> 00:20:41,592
- And what was in that little bag?
- Sweets.

234
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:45,054
Sweets! You can
put this on yourself.

235
00:20:51,894 --> 00:20:52,937
Let's go.

236
00:20:52,978 --> 00:20:55,064
Carlo, here we are!

237
00:20:57,608 --> 00:21:00,653
- At last!
- How are you, darling?

238
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:02,363
Weren't you due back last night?

239
00:21:02,446 --> 00:21:04,240
- Yes...
- So how come?

240
00:21:04,281 --> 00:21:06,408
I'll tell you later. Look!

241
00:21:07,117 --> 00:21:10,162
Is it for me? How much did it cost?

242
00:21:10,204 --> 00:21:12,706
- Do you like it?
- Oh, yes!

243
00:21:12,748 --> 00:21:15,459
- I want to see!
- Come and look, Silvana.

244
00:21:15,501 --> 00:21:17,962
So where are we going to eat?

245
00:21:18,003 --> 00:21:20,464
Wherever you want.
Let's decide once we're outside.

246
00:21:20,506 --> 00:21:23,884
It's wonderful! Look what
a lovely present! Let's go.

247
00:21:23,926 --> 00:21:26,804
But you could have
sent me a telegram.

248
00:21:26,887 --> 00:21:29,640
And I don't know
where to get hold of you.

249
00:21:29,682 --> 00:21:32,476
What can I do?
That's the job of a salesman.

250
00:21:32,518 --> 00:21:34,436
We sold everything.

251
00:21:34,478 --> 00:21:38,524
There was a market nearby
and Augusto suggested we try there.

252
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:43,779
So we tried and we managed to sell
all the material - all of it!

253
00:21:43,821 --> 00:21:46,282
In fact, look - they paid us in cash.

254
00:21:47,324 --> 00:21:51,328
- Is it all ours?
- Of course.

255
00:21:52,663 --> 00:21:54,790
- How much is it?
- 100,000.

256
00:21:54,832 --> 00:21:57,626
We should give at least 20
to the trattoria.

257
00:21:57,668 --> 00:21:59,920
Well, ten would do. And then...

258
00:21:59,962 --> 00:22:02,131
Did anyone phone me at home today?

259
00:22:02,173 --> 00:22:04,133
No. But how did you do it?

260
00:22:04,175 --> 00:22:07,553
We sold them, didn't we?
So, ten to the trattoria,

261
00:22:07,595 --> 00:22:09,972
another ten to your mother
so she stops bothering us.

262
00:22:10,014 --> 00:22:13,893
No, we'll give 20 to the trattoria
and pay the baker and the others.

263
00:22:13,976 --> 00:22:18,314
I'll be able to go out without them
all looking at me with that face!

264
00:22:18,355 --> 00:22:20,149
All right, as you wish.

265
00:22:20,191 --> 00:22:22,318
In fact, it's better if you take it.

266
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:24,445
You'll see that
I'll make it last a month!

267
00:22:24,486 --> 00:22:27,990
- Then you can paint in peace.
- Whose is that pretty face?

268
00:22:28,032 --> 00:22:31,118
- You should paint!
- Of course.

269
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,412
Oh, Iris, I discovered such places!

270
00:22:33,454 --> 00:22:39,084
We'll have to go there together one day.
Beautiful hilly landscapes.

271
00:22:56,602 --> 00:22:59,313
He kills me, that guy!

272
00:23:12,618 --> 00:23:14,286
Hey! Hello, folks!

273
00:23:14,328 --> 00:23:16,455
The dosh has arrived!

274
00:23:30,094 --> 00:23:31,720
- Here.
- Thanks!

275
00:23:32,805 --> 00:23:34,056
Have a cigarette.

276
00:23:37,601 --> 00:23:42,273
Luigi, come here. What's the best
champagne you've got?

277
00:23:42,314 --> 00:23:44,775
We've got Cordon Rouge,
Perrier Jouet.

278
00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:47,611
Ah, for me... Perrier Jouet!

279
00:23:50,698 --> 00:23:53,242
And bring some drinks
for that thirsty lot.

280
00:23:53,284 --> 00:23:55,411
- Thank you
- Cheers!

281
00:23:55,452 --> 00:23:57,162
Robè. Who did you make cry?

282
00:23:57,204 --> 00:23:58,247
See you, Riccà.

283
00:24:03,794 --> 00:24:05,796
They've ordered champagne.

284
00:24:08,632 --> 00:24:10,176
Everything all right, Signor Rocca?

285
00:24:10,217 --> 00:24:11,594
Here you are.

286
00:24:54,762 --> 00:24:57,306
Robè! Roberto!

287
00:24:57,348 --> 00:25:00,768
Did you see the Cadillac outside?
He's loaded!

288
00:25:26,544 --> 00:25:29,380
- Do you work here?
- Sorry?

289
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:34,218
I said... do you dance?

290
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,470
I entertain.

291
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:40,724
What are you, German?

292
00:25:40,808 --> 00:25:42,351
No, I'm English.

293
00:25:46,272 --> 00:25:50,985
- Do you sing too?
- No, only for myself.

294
00:25:51,026 --> 00:25:53,112
What a beautiful girl you are!

295
00:26:00,202 --> 00:26:03,831
- I have to go. This is my number.
- Of course.

296
00:26:51,879 --> 00:26:53,756
Fine.

297
00:27:05,392 --> 00:27:06,393
Nothing.

298
00:27:31,085 --> 00:27:33,295
Hey, you're wrecking my drum.

299
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,388
Listen, Augusto! This is for you!

300
00:27:45,349 --> 00:27:50,104
Luigi, you see what an irresponsible lot
I have to work with?

301
00:27:50,145 --> 00:27:53,524
They're only capable
of being kept by women.

302
00:27:53,566 --> 00:27:55,359
The youth today is like that.

303
00:27:55,401 --> 00:27:57,111
I was never like that!

304
00:27:57,152 --> 00:27:59,405
I've always worked in style.

305
00:27:59,488 --> 00:28:01,615
I've swindled my way
round the world.

306
00:28:01,699 --> 00:28:03,617
The world is full of idiots.

307
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:06,829
I can sell ice to Eskimos!

308
00:28:07,872 --> 00:28:10,583
And I have to work
with these amateurs.

309
00:28:11,876 --> 00:28:14,295
I'm going back to
working on my own.

310
00:28:16,755 --> 00:28:18,382
Shall we go?

311
00:28:19,466 --> 00:28:23,971
Give me the violin. You'll break it.
It cost 40,000 lire.

312
00:28:24,054 --> 00:28:26,098
Play the variations
or I won't give it to you.

313
00:28:26,182 --> 00:28:29,310
I'll play them. Give it to me.

314
00:28:29,351 --> 00:28:30,895
Go on then, play.

315
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,537
He's a good-Iooking boy, Roberto, isn't he?
Do you like him?

316
00:28:48,579 --> 00:28:52,208
I prefer to stay with you.
Don't you want me to?

317
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,182
Word of honour. I assure you
you're getting a bargain!

318
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:13,103
I'm a bit hard up at the moment.
I'll let you have it for 15,000.

319
00:29:13,145 --> 00:29:15,814
It belongs to my wife -
a present from me.

320
00:29:15,856 --> 00:29:20,986
I wouldn't be selling it
if I wasn't up to my neck.

321
00:29:21,028 --> 00:29:23,614
These are times one goes through...

322
00:29:23,656 --> 00:29:25,741
- Hey, Augusto.
- Hello there!

323
00:29:26,742 --> 00:29:28,452
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

324
00:29:28,494 --> 00:29:30,454
- What are you doing? Selling it?
- Yes.

325
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:34,041
- For how much?
- 15,000!

326
00:29:34,083 --> 00:29:35,876
I would have bought it!

327
00:29:35,918 --> 00:29:37,878
- So you would have bought it?
- Of course.

328
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,381
Okay, then, it's yours. Take it.

329
00:29:40,422 --> 00:29:44,218
If you do this kind of business,

330
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:49,723
I could provide you with
three dozen at 1,500, tax free.

331
00:29:51,308 --> 00:29:52,643
How do you mean, sorry?

332
00:29:52,685 --> 00:29:56,814
I mean that I buy them at 500 lire
in Lugano.

333
00:29:56,856 --> 00:30:00,234
I mean that
I've lived long enough to go grey

334
00:30:00,276 --> 00:30:03,821
doing this kind of business,
if I say so myself.

335
00:30:03,863 --> 00:30:07,283
- Would you like something to drink?
- What a nice chap! A Campari.

336
00:30:07,324 --> 00:30:09,869
- And you?
- Well, perhaps I'll have a Negroni.

337
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,996
A Campari, a Negroni and a lemonade.

338
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:14,206
- I'm really sorry.
- I'll take it.

339
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:16,834
What do you mean you'll take it?
Give it here!

340
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,629
Didn't you realise he was so sharp?

341
00:30:20,671 --> 00:30:22,214
It's the Barone.

342
00:30:22,256 --> 00:30:24,884
- The Milanese is paying.
- Send the drinks over there.

343
00:30:24,925 --> 00:30:27,553
It seems everything's ready
for tomorrow morning.

344
00:30:28,012 --> 00:30:31,682
Vargas has had another great idea.
On the outskirts of Rome...

345
00:31:02,546 --> 00:31:04,965
Lads! Stop it!

346
00:31:05,007 --> 00:31:06,884
Get away from here. Come on!

347
00:31:06,926 --> 00:31:09,011
Come on, get a move on.

348
00:31:10,095 --> 00:31:12,181
Dottore, allow me.

349
00:31:20,731 --> 00:31:22,358
Ah, good morning.

350
00:31:23,984 --> 00:31:26,445
Hey! Look at you!

351
00:31:26,487 --> 00:31:29,573
Up there all alone!

352
00:31:29,615 --> 00:31:33,410
What are you doing?
Are you in the mountains?

353
00:31:33,452 --> 00:31:38,082
Come on, don't cry.
Come here and I'll get you down.

354
00:31:38,165 --> 00:31:39,959
What's he doing?

355
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,504
- You won't tell me your name?
- Hey, what are you doing?

356
00:31:43,546 --> 00:31:45,339
This is my boy!

357
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:47,508
He could have fallen off the roof.

358
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:50,094
Anyway, could you please tell me...

359
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,516
...where I can find...
Signor Sigismondo Giacotti?

360
00:31:55,558 --> 00:31:58,727
Hey, is Sigismondo Giacotti here?

361
00:31:58,769 --> 00:32:00,896
He's gone to hospital.

362
00:32:05,734 --> 00:32:09,071
Well, then, Giovanni Bartoli?

363
00:32:09,113 --> 00:32:12,533
Giovanni Bartoli? Ask him.

364
00:32:12,575 --> 00:32:14,285
Who wants Giovanni Bartoli?

365
00:32:14,326 --> 00:32:18,414
It was just for
the allocation of council houses.

366
00:32:18,455 --> 00:32:20,374
- They're giving houses?
- That's right.

367
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:23,169
- I applied two years ago.
- Me too.

368
00:32:23,252 --> 00:32:24,837
Is Bevilacqua there?

369
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,047
I applied too.

370
00:32:27,131 --> 00:32:31,552
The Commendatore is here.
He'll be able to explain everything.

371
00:32:31,594 --> 00:32:33,387
Pilade, they've come about the houses!

372
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:37,975
Bice! It's about the houses!

373
00:32:38,017 --> 00:32:40,311
Calm down. Don't cause a riot!

374
00:32:40,352 --> 00:32:43,731
One at a time. The Commendatore
will explain everything.

375
00:32:43,772 --> 00:32:45,858
Don't make such a racket.

376
00:32:46,692 --> 00:32:49,361
I said cut it out! One at a time.

377
00:32:49,403 --> 00:32:53,449
Good morning, Commendatô.
You lot have finally woken up.

378
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:54,783
Did you explain?

379
00:32:54,825 --> 00:32:57,786
I said we've come
for the housing allocation.

380
00:32:57,828 --> 00:32:59,997
The first family tell me
they live over there.

381
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:02,499
They're giving us a house!

382
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:04,001
Yes, a house!

383
00:33:04,043 --> 00:33:06,420
How long have they been
talking about it?

384
00:33:06,462 --> 00:33:08,172
I applied two years ago!

385
00:33:08,214 --> 00:33:09,381
Commendatô!

386
00:33:09,423 --> 00:33:12,635
This is a godsend!
My name's Sor Antonio.

387
00:33:12,676 --> 00:33:14,386
I applied 14 months ago!

388
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,597
Who are they giving houses to?

389
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,057
To this scurvy?!

390
00:33:20,768 --> 00:33:23,229
What's happened to my application?

391
00:33:28,984 --> 00:33:32,488
Commendatore, I've applied, too!

392
00:33:41,205 --> 00:33:44,124
One moment! Calm down, please!

393
00:33:49,922 --> 00:33:53,884
In a month,
the first flats will be allocated.

394
00:33:53,926 --> 00:33:56,178
They've been saying that for years!

395
00:34:00,933 --> 00:34:06,146
That's enough! Silence!
One at a time, let's go.

396
00:34:06,939 --> 00:34:08,983
Here are your contracts.

397
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:12,903
You just have to sign
and make the first down payment.

398
00:34:12,945 --> 00:34:14,405
What?

399
00:34:14,446 --> 00:34:17,324
How much is it?

400
00:34:17,366 --> 00:34:19,535
It depends on the number of rooms.

401
00:34:19,577 --> 00:34:24,582
It could be 9,000, 9,500, 10,000.
It depends on the number of rooms.

402
00:34:24,665 --> 00:34:26,792
And what if we haven't got it?

403
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:30,963
If you haven't got it, don't worry.
You'll be in the second group.

404
00:34:31,005 --> 00:34:33,132
Next time it'll be your turn.

405
00:34:33,174 --> 00:34:35,217
How much is it for me?
Ada Colangeli?

406
00:34:35,259 --> 00:34:37,178
Have a look for Ada Colangeli.

407
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:40,306
- I said two rooms.
- Colangeli, 9,000 lire.

408
00:34:40,347 --> 00:34:42,725
Fiorelli Luigi?
I applied three years ago.

409
00:34:42,808 --> 00:34:44,935
- And you?
- Maria Bove, Commendatô.

410
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:47,563
- And you?
- Calabrô Catena!

411
00:34:47,605 --> 00:34:49,481
- Did you apply?
- Five months ago.

412
00:34:49,523 --> 00:34:51,775
I applied two years ago.

413
00:34:51,817 --> 00:34:54,904
Two years?!
You had a house and you sold it.

414
00:34:54,945 --> 00:34:57,489
This merits no compassion.

415
00:34:57,531 --> 00:35:00,951
- But it wasn't my house.
- You wanted to sell it to me!

416
00:35:04,455 --> 00:35:06,707
Commendatore,
you'll be more comfortable in here.

417
00:35:13,047 --> 00:35:16,467
Calm down! One at a time! Calm down!

418
00:35:16,509 --> 00:35:19,678
Sorry it's in a bit of a mess.
Take a seat, Commendatô.

419
00:35:23,766 --> 00:35:27,061
Calm down. Could you all calm down?

420
00:35:34,818 --> 00:35:36,904
The little boy's mine.

421
00:35:42,076 --> 00:35:44,036
- Who's first?
- Ernestina Giacotti.

422
00:35:44,078 --> 00:35:46,664
That's me, Commendatore,
God bless you.

423
00:35:46,705 --> 00:35:49,542
- Gino Bevilacqua!
- Here I am.

424
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:52,670
Ah! 8,500.

425
00:35:52,753 --> 00:35:54,004
Aldo Nevi!

426
00:35:54,088 --> 00:35:55,089
Sign here.

427
00:35:55,172 --> 00:35:58,175
Calabrô Catena!

428
00:35:59,176 --> 00:36:01,303
10,500!

429
00:36:01,345 --> 00:36:03,264
I've only got 4,000 lire!

430
00:36:03,305 --> 00:36:05,224
Let her through!

431
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:07,268
Celestina Mengozzi!

432
00:36:07,309 --> 00:36:09,144
7,700 lire.

433
00:36:09,186 --> 00:36:12,565
Commendatô, I've got the money.
9,000 lire.

434
00:36:12,606 --> 00:36:15,276
My name is De Felice, Giovanni.

435
00:36:15,317 --> 00:36:18,028
Here, I've got 5,000 lire.

436
00:36:18,112 --> 00:36:20,990
- Can you lend me 1,000 lire?
- To you of all people?

437
00:36:26,662 --> 00:36:28,789
I'd like to find something.

438
00:36:28,831 --> 00:36:31,292
- Don't you like these?
- I don't feel like eating.

439
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:34,336
The most welcome of presents!

440
00:36:34,378 --> 00:36:37,173
I have to give you 10,000 lire.

441
00:36:37,214 --> 00:36:39,383
Yes, give it here!

442
00:36:40,092 --> 00:36:42,678
I like this! Augusto, look!

443
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,388
For your children - 200 lire each.

444
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:47,558
Look! How come it won't come out?

445
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,644
Not like that, sir.
You have to blow softly.

446
00:36:50,686 --> 00:36:54,565
Oh, yes, I get it.
I'll do it. Blow softly.

447
00:36:54,607 --> 00:36:56,984
Here, sir, you try.

448
00:36:57,026 --> 00:36:59,028
Augusto, watch.

449
00:36:59,987 --> 00:37:04,533
It's fun, isn't it, sir?
Only 200 lire.

450
00:37:04,575 --> 00:37:07,453
It doesn't cost much
to make children happy.

451
00:37:10,581 --> 00:37:12,666
Nice, isn't it?

452
00:37:17,379 --> 00:37:20,007
Don't you like it, Augusto?
Wrap it up!

453
00:37:20,049 --> 00:37:21,425
Let's go!

454
00:37:21,467 --> 00:37:25,179
Just a minute while I pay.
I want to take it to Silvana.

455
00:37:25,221 --> 00:37:27,431
She'll like this
more than anything else!

456
00:37:27,473 --> 00:37:29,350
You're the one who's enjoying it.

457
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,103
Watch out!

458
00:37:34,063 --> 00:37:35,898
What are you playing at?

459
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:40,945
You old cockroach, jailbird, turkey!

460
00:37:40,986 --> 00:37:43,239
You old rogue!

461
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,326
Augusto! It's me! Don't you recognise me?
What are you doing?

462
00:37:47,368 --> 00:37:49,411
Rinaldo!

463
00:37:50,204 --> 00:37:53,165
- How are you?
- Fine. How are you?

464
00:37:53,207 --> 00:37:56,710
- Where are you off to?
- Piazza del Popolo, with a friend.

465
00:37:56,752 --> 00:37:59,880
Bring him too.
Get in. I'll take you.

466
00:38:02,383 --> 00:38:03,759
What manners!

467
00:38:03,801 --> 00:38:05,845
Oh, what's up?

468
00:38:05,886 --> 00:38:08,055
Fancy meeting you on New Year's Eve!

469
00:38:08,097 --> 00:38:09,682
Good evening, signora.

470
00:38:09,723 --> 00:38:10,933
Good evening.

471
00:38:30,035 --> 00:38:32,329
- Hey, Augù!
- Yes?

472
00:38:32,371 --> 00:38:34,748
Who brought you the loaf
with the file?

473
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:37,501
The same baker
who brought it to you!

474
00:38:44,884 --> 00:38:48,429
It's been two years. What have
you been up to all this time?

475
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:52,933
Same old thing.
What about you, more to the point?

476
00:38:53,851 --> 00:38:56,145
I see you travel like a king.

477
00:38:57,771 --> 00:39:00,357
Last time I saw you, you tried
to trick me out of 5,000 lire.

478
00:39:00,399 --> 00:39:03,611
I did trick you out of 5,000!

479
00:39:03,652 --> 00:39:06,113
No, you didn't
swindle me out of anything!

480
00:39:06,155 --> 00:39:10,409
What do you mean?
I swindled you, don't you worry!

481
00:39:10,451 --> 00:39:13,287
Now he says he can't remember!

482
00:39:14,371 --> 00:39:19,752
Luciana, you know who this is?
He's a curse!

483
00:39:19,793 --> 00:39:23,339
He's moved half of Italy to tears.
It's Monsignor Bidone.

484
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,549
He's worse than a flood!

485
00:39:25,633 --> 00:39:30,012
Augusto Rocca, pleased to meet you.

486
00:39:30,054 --> 00:39:35,142
Listen, Augù, do you still
go round with those skulls?

487
00:39:35,184 --> 00:39:37,645
What a crook you are!

488
00:39:37,686 --> 00:39:43,275
Signora, do you know him well?
This gentleman?

489
00:39:43,317 --> 00:39:47,947
Picasso, if he shakes hands with you,
count your fingers.

490
00:39:47,988 --> 00:39:51,992
You can be sure
you'll be missing at least two.

491
00:39:52,076 --> 00:39:55,162
Tell me, though. This car...

492
00:39:57,706 --> 00:39:59,792
- Is it really yours?
- Who else's would it be?

493
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:03,879
It must have cost a fortune!
At least four, four and a half.

494
00:40:03,921 --> 00:40:07,091
No, even five,
five and a half if you don't mind!

495
00:40:07,132 --> 00:40:09,969
In Switzerland you pay a bit less.

496
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:13,222
My wife and girls live there.

497
00:40:13,264 --> 00:40:17,393
I bought them a villa in Geneva.
Lake out front - and the climate!

498
00:40:17,434 --> 00:40:19,353
The kids go to school there -

499
00:40:19,395 --> 00:40:22,940
you can't beat the Swiss
for education.

500
00:40:22,982 --> 00:40:24,316
They're a great people.

501
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:27,194
Here everyone's clueless.

502
00:40:27,236 --> 00:40:30,155
- What are you up to at midnight?
- I'm at the house of a friend of mine.

503
00:40:30,197 --> 00:40:33,117
You have to come to my house.

504
00:40:33,158 --> 00:40:35,369
I'll expect you this evening
after ten.

505
00:40:35,452 --> 00:40:38,622
I want to see you.
I'm not letting you go now!

506
00:40:38,664 --> 00:40:41,125
Thanks, but I've got to go
with my friend.

507
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:43,544
Bring him too. It doesn't matter.

508
00:40:43,586 --> 00:40:47,798
- His wife's expecting us.
- Bring the signora, too!

509
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,592
Rinaldo Russi.

510
00:40:49,633 --> 00:40:51,343
Bring the signora, too.

511
00:40:51,385 --> 00:40:54,930
I'll expect you in via Archimede 38.
I'm on the third floor.

512
00:40:54,972 --> 00:40:57,224
Don't be late
or you'll miss the best.

513
00:40:57,266 --> 00:40:58,350
Okay!

514
00:41:02,479 --> 00:41:07,443
I'm counting on you. If you're
not there, I'll come and find you.

515
00:41:07,443 --> 00:41:08,861
Let them out.

516
00:41:08,903 --> 00:41:12,072
Sorry, signora, sorry.

517
00:41:12,114 --> 00:41:13,949
Thank you.

518
00:41:16,035 --> 00:41:18,996
When are you going to
get rid of that belly?

519
00:41:19,038 --> 00:41:20,623
Good evening, signora!

520
00:41:20,706 --> 00:41:22,917
Goodbye. Good night, signora!

521
00:41:25,044 --> 00:41:28,297
- Who is he?
- You know who he is. I told you.

522
00:41:53,822 --> 00:41:56,867
- I feel awkward. I'm not coming.
- Don't be silly.

523
00:41:56,909 --> 00:41:59,328
Come on, come on.

524
00:42:23,102 --> 00:42:26,689
Augusto! Augusto! Over here!

525
00:42:28,274 --> 00:42:31,610
Rinaldo! Lovely house you've got.

526
00:42:31,652 --> 00:42:34,113
Picasso! Picasso! Come over here!

527
00:42:34,154 --> 00:42:35,865
Come on, Iris.

528
00:42:36,949 --> 00:42:39,243
Come over here.

529
00:42:39,326 --> 00:42:43,706
- This is Signora Picasso.
- Pleased to meet you. Have fun.

530
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:47,126
Can't you see like this?

531
00:42:47,168 --> 00:42:50,212
Tricks! What tricks?

532
00:42:50,254 --> 00:42:52,882
- But nowadays...
- Yes, but not me!

533
00:42:52,923 --> 00:42:55,759
Just a moment.
Keep cool. It's all resolved.

534
00:42:55,801 --> 00:43:00,055
Signorina, a friend of mine
has arrived, the sculptor Bidone.

535
00:43:00,097 --> 00:43:03,559
- You can trust him, he's an artist.
- You're a sculptor?

536
00:43:03,642 --> 00:43:07,229
Of course. He made a monument
in Terni to swindlers!

537
00:43:07,271 --> 00:43:08,939
That's right.

538
00:43:08,981 --> 00:43:10,858
Yes, tomorrow!

539
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,153
- Mari, you're really stupid!
- Why stupid?

540
00:43:14,195 --> 00:43:18,365
Look, signorina,
let's make something clear.

541
00:43:18,407 --> 00:43:21,660
You want to enter
the beauty contest?

542
00:43:21,702 --> 00:43:24,663
You say you've got a good bust,
but we don't believe it.

543
00:43:24,705 --> 00:43:27,708
So what should I do?

544
00:43:27,791 --> 00:43:29,251
- Undress!
- All right.

545
00:43:29,335 --> 00:43:31,545
- What are you looking at?

546
00:43:31,587 --> 00:43:33,422
Let us have a look, too!

547
00:43:50,231 --> 00:43:52,274
Good evening, signora!

548
00:44:00,449 --> 00:44:02,284
Stop it!

549
00:44:03,619 --> 00:44:05,913
What's going on? What are you doing?

550
00:44:05,955 --> 00:44:08,666
- Nothing. It's that stupid Marisa.
- What's Marisa doing?

551
00:44:08,707 --> 00:44:11,252
Off you go! Get lost!

552
00:44:16,382 --> 00:44:17,925
Oh, good evening!

553
00:44:17,967 --> 00:44:19,593
Iris!

554
00:44:20,135 --> 00:44:23,222
Iris, come here a moment!

555
00:44:24,265 --> 00:44:26,809
Allow me to introduce my wife!

556
00:44:26,851 --> 00:44:29,311
The signorina - the signora -
is the hostess.

557
00:44:29,353 --> 00:44:30,604
Pleased to meet you.

558
00:44:33,274 --> 00:44:34,608
- Shall we dance?
- Yes!

559
00:44:43,158 --> 00:44:45,160
Robertino!

560
00:44:45,995 --> 00:44:48,581
Picasso! Who let you in?

561
00:44:48,622 --> 00:44:51,375
Ciao, Roberto. Are you here too?

562
00:44:51,417 --> 00:44:54,545
It's a popular party!
Good evening, signora!

563
00:44:54,587 --> 00:44:56,088
Good evening!

564
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:58,507
- We've come with Augusto.
- The old man's here, too?

565
00:44:58,591 --> 00:45:02,344
- We came with him, yes.
- Ah, good. Excuse me.

566
00:45:02,386 --> 00:45:05,097
Does Augusto know the host?

567
00:45:05,139 --> 00:45:10,269
Yes, they're old friends. He gave us
a lift. He's the one who invited us.

568
00:45:10,311 --> 00:45:14,023
He's quite a character!
They said he's made money with...

569
00:45:14,064 --> 00:45:15,733
Oh, yes, I know...

570
00:45:16,775 --> 00:45:20,196
- I didn't know.
- And where's Augusto now?

571
00:45:20,237 --> 00:45:22,281
Give me my dress.

572
00:45:22,364 --> 00:45:26,285
- You can enter the contest!
- Stop it! That's enough.

573
00:45:26,368 --> 00:45:29,788
That's enough! Marisa,
go in the room and get dressed.

574
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:36,462
No, that's enough now!
Get dressed!

575
00:45:39,757 --> 00:45:42,343
It's pretty lively in here! May I?

576
00:45:42,384 --> 00:45:46,055
Augusto, you look radiant this evening!

577
00:45:46,138 --> 00:45:49,433
Is it true that you're friends
with the host?

578
00:45:49,475 --> 00:45:50,643
What are you after?

579
00:45:50,684 --> 00:45:53,979
What are you up to?
Is there something in it for me?

580
00:45:54,021 --> 00:45:56,148
Don't forget, I'm a friend of yours!

581
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:58,150
May I?

582
00:46:01,111 --> 00:46:04,698
Excuse me. Rinaldo, open up!

583
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:08,994
- There's no-one in there.
- Open up. Creep!

584
00:46:09,078 --> 00:46:12,831
Rinaldo, if you don't open
immediately, you'll regret it.

585
00:46:12,915 --> 00:46:14,458
Open up!

586
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,878
- Stop it. There are people here!
- I couldn't care less!

587
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,255
Open up!

588
00:46:19,296 --> 00:46:20,881
What are you doing?

589
00:46:20,923 --> 00:46:24,969
Aren't you ashamed?
You're your mother's daughter, all right!

590
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:27,388
What's going on?

591
00:46:27,429 --> 00:46:30,599
She wasn't feeling well.
Someone had to help her.

592
00:46:30,641 --> 00:46:33,769
- Give me a kiss!
- I'll give you a kiss!

593
00:46:33,811 --> 00:46:35,688
They're joking, you know?

594
00:46:35,771 --> 00:46:37,857
Let's go and forget it with a drink.

595
00:46:37,898 --> 00:46:40,150
She had a fright. It's nothing!

596
00:46:40,192 --> 00:46:44,405
I'm sorry, but I believe
you're one of those rare people

597
00:46:44,446 --> 00:46:46,949
capable of appreciating
a truly good picture.

598
00:46:46,991 --> 00:46:48,617
So I've taken the liberty...

599
00:46:48,659 --> 00:46:51,078
Ciao, Picasso! May I?

600
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,623
I'm a friend of Augusto's,
Roberto Giorgio.

601
00:46:54,665 --> 00:46:56,417
And his friend, too.

602
00:46:56,458 --> 00:46:59,503
You're a great host.
I've really enjoyed it!

603
00:47:00,963 --> 00:47:02,256
What were you saying?

604
00:47:02,298 --> 00:47:07,595
That you seemed like someone
who really knows about painting!

605
00:47:07,636 --> 00:47:10,055
And I'm your subject!

606
00:47:10,097 --> 00:47:11,473
I said I'm your subject!

607
00:47:11,515 --> 00:47:16,103
You know that a beautiful painting
completes the decor.

608
00:47:16,145 --> 00:47:18,439
- Let's see what you've got there.
- Yes, gladly.

609
00:47:18,522 --> 00:47:23,360
This is a De Pisis. Someone like
yourself can see that at a glance.

610
00:47:23,402 --> 00:47:25,362
Did you do it?

611
00:47:25,404 --> 00:47:27,948
No, no. I've been painting
for several years...

612
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:29,950
It's ten to midnight!

613
00:47:29,992 --> 00:47:31,952
Turn the TV back on.

614
00:47:34,413 --> 00:47:37,374
I think he liked it.

615
00:47:37,416 --> 00:47:40,920
How about introducing me to Rinaldo?

616
00:47:41,003 --> 00:47:45,508
You think he needs people like you?
Don't make me laugh!

617
00:47:45,549 --> 00:47:50,638
You're a fine friend!
You'll pay for this. Augusto!

618
00:47:51,847 --> 00:47:52,890
Give me a whisky.

619
00:47:52,932 --> 00:47:57,019
Rinaldo! Tell him how much you took
that time for the fire damage.

620
00:47:57,061 --> 00:47:59,188
Oh, I can't remember.

621
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:01,815
You're getting on my nerves!

622
00:48:01,857 --> 00:48:04,735
I can't remember. 15, 16 million.

623
00:48:04,818 --> 00:48:08,614
16 million? Tell this fool -
he doesn't believe it.

624
00:48:11,033 --> 00:48:15,454
You don't remember how much they
gave you? You need a secretary.

625
00:48:15,496 --> 00:48:17,790
Luci! Are you listening?

626
00:48:21,377 --> 00:48:23,462
Excuse me...

627
00:48:24,505 --> 00:48:26,674
Get off. I'm cross with you.

628
00:48:26,757 --> 00:48:29,218
Come on, Luci, let's make up.

629
00:48:30,386 --> 00:48:32,263
I meant it.

630
00:48:32,304 --> 00:48:38,018
You, with that face?! My secretary?
You'd get me arrested immediately.

631
00:48:47,695 --> 00:48:50,406
Nina! What are you doing
with the glasses!

632
00:48:50,447 --> 00:48:53,117
I had to wash them. We'd run out.

633
00:48:53,158 --> 00:48:56,537
You go and have a look.
She's hopeless.

634
00:48:57,997 --> 00:48:59,456
Up you get.

635
00:49:19,268 --> 00:49:22,688
Rinaldo, listen.
I've got to talk to you.

636
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:26,192
- Let's have breakfast tomorrow.
- Why?

637
00:49:26,233 --> 00:49:29,236
Let's do something
together tomorrow.

638
00:49:29,278 --> 00:49:31,155
I'll give you a light.

639
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,660
There's something very important.

640
00:49:37,828 --> 00:49:39,288
Listen.

641
00:49:40,414 --> 00:49:44,251
- What do want to tell me?
- Do you remember the Texas Club?

642
00:49:44,293 --> 00:49:48,506
They'll let me rent it
for three years - in my name.

643
00:49:48,547 --> 00:49:52,384
I'll guarantee you
30,000 lire a day.

644
00:49:59,141 --> 00:50:02,144
Wouldn't 30,000 interest you?

645
00:50:02,228 --> 00:50:03,979
Grab him!

646
00:50:08,901 --> 00:50:10,611
Grab him!

647
00:50:10,653 --> 00:50:14,907
At midnight we'll throw
the old rubbish out the window!

648
00:50:19,787 --> 00:50:24,875
That's enough now.
You're going to ruin my new suit.

649
00:50:24,917 --> 00:50:27,211
No, no, not my trousers!

650
00:51:17,678 --> 00:51:19,555
- Happy New Year.
- Cheers!

651
00:51:27,521 --> 00:51:30,232
This year you should
hold an exhibition.

652
00:51:30,316 --> 00:51:32,359
Whatever you want.

653
00:52:12,149 --> 00:52:15,653
One of these days, you know
what we'll do? We'll go to Venice.

654
00:52:15,694 --> 00:52:19,490
You've got to see it.
You can't imagine what Venice is like!

655
00:52:19,573 --> 00:52:23,118
Think what fun
Silvana would have in a gondola.

656
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:26,539
Or maybe...
Would you prefer Taormina?

657
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:28,958
It's marvellous, even in winter.

658
00:52:28,999 --> 00:52:33,087
No, Venice is more poetic.
But I'd need an evening gown.

659
00:52:33,128 --> 00:52:36,006
Of course you would.
And you'll have one.

660
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:41,470
Carlo, I don't look right like this.

661
00:52:41,554 --> 00:52:46,767
They're all in evening dress.
I knew I shouldn't have come.

662
00:52:46,809 --> 00:52:48,561
You're still the prettiest.

663
00:52:48,602 --> 00:52:52,815
If you weren't already my wife,
I'd be making a move for you.

664
00:52:54,066 --> 00:52:57,695
My head's spinning.
Maybe I've drunk too much.

665
00:52:57,736 --> 00:53:00,614
- But it's nice, champagne.
- Of course!

666
00:53:03,742 --> 00:53:07,413
Signora, have you seen
a gold cigarette case by any chance?

667
00:53:07,496 --> 00:53:09,373
No, I'm sorry.

668
00:53:41,155 --> 00:53:42,323
What are you saying?!

669
00:53:42,364 --> 00:53:45,701
It's midnight
and you haven't given me a kiss.

670
00:53:46,785 --> 00:53:48,037
Kiss me!

671
00:53:51,373 --> 00:53:55,211
Don't be disgusting! Look what
you've done to my ear, stupid!

672
00:54:00,508 --> 00:54:03,552
- Are you two staying much longer?
- Well... yes.

673
00:54:04,386 --> 00:54:07,556
Have you seen? She's wearing
five million just on her head.

674
00:54:07,598 --> 00:54:10,267
- Who is she?
- Some old hag.

675
00:54:11,769 --> 00:54:13,020
Ugly!

676
00:54:15,105 --> 00:54:17,942
We'll open an investment office
in a small town.

677
00:54:17,983 --> 00:54:21,445
If it goes wrong,
it'll be me who goes inside.

678
00:54:22,947 --> 00:54:27,117
- Rinaldo, I'll put it in my name.
- What?

679
00:54:27,159 --> 00:54:29,662
What? The investment office.

680
00:54:29,703 --> 00:54:33,791
Don't you understand? I'm not
interested in these things anymore.

681
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,545
Hey, how old are you?

682
00:54:38,629 --> 00:54:41,799
- Why?
- Go on, tell me how old you are.

683
00:54:41,841 --> 00:54:43,217
48.

684
00:54:45,511 --> 00:54:50,432
And you're still in the game?
Amazing! Shame on you!

685
00:54:51,892 --> 00:54:52,977
Rinaldo.

686
00:54:53,018 --> 00:54:57,064
- What's up?
- Come here a minute.

687
00:54:57,106 --> 00:54:58,607
- What do you want?
- Come here!

688
00:54:59,984 --> 00:55:01,861
What a pain!

689
00:55:10,202 --> 00:55:11,912
Let's see.

690
00:55:16,959 --> 00:55:20,421
Hey! Here's our most generous host!

691
00:55:20,462 --> 00:55:25,301
I was just coming to thank you
and to wish you a happy New Year.

692
00:55:25,342 --> 00:55:26,802
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

693
00:55:26,844 --> 00:55:31,223
There's a lady over there
who's lost her cigarette case.

694
00:55:31,265 --> 00:55:33,517
Poor thing, I'm sorry.

695
00:55:33,559 --> 00:55:36,562
Hardly surprising in this confusion.

696
00:55:36,604 --> 00:55:39,273
The cigarette case is gold, you know.

697
00:55:39,315 --> 00:55:40,566
I don't understand.

698
00:55:40,608 --> 00:55:43,652
You don't understand?
You didn't happen to find it?

699
00:55:43,694 --> 00:55:47,573
You might have picked it up
without thinking.

700
00:55:47,656 --> 00:55:51,160
Then, when you get home,
out it comes.

701
00:55:51,202 --> 00:55:53,829
You know, I still don't understand.

702
00:55:53,871 --> 00:55:56,999
This guy makes me laugh!

703
00:55:57,041 --> 00:55:59,835
You know what I'd do if I were you?

704
00:55:59,877 --> 00:56:02,922
- Tell me.
- I'd look for it and I'd find it.

705
00:56:02,963 --> 00:56:04,590
What's happened?

706
00:56:04,632 --> 00:56:08,010
It seems the Contessa's been robbed.

707
00:56:08,093 --> 00:56:12,014
The thing is, I'd do that gladly.
However...

708
00:56:16,185 --> 00:56:18,145
Look, what are you getting at?

709
00:56:18,187 --> 00:56:22,900
You should think twice
before playing games here.

710
00:56:22,942 --> 00:56:25,694
Offer the lady a cigarette.

711
00:56:25,736 --> 00:56:27,613
Are you going to tell me
what you mean?

712
00:56:27,655 --> 00:56:30,449
Come on, just pretend you were joking.

713
00:56:30,491 --> 00:56:33,619
Do you understand?

714
00:56:33,702 --> 00:56:37,748
You tell us you were joking
and everyone's happy.

715
00:56:38,707 --> 00:56:42,253
So are you going to tell us
you were joking? Yes or no?

716
00:56:42,294 --> 00:56:43,754
Okay, I was joking!

717
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:49,885
You were taken in - tell the truth!

718
00:56:49,927 --> 00:56:52,221
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

719
00:56:52,263 --> 00:56:55,432
Satisfied? Happy New Year!

720
00:56:58,143 --> 00:57:00,271
Augù! What friends you've got!

721
00:57:00,312 --> 00:57:03,357
And you go round with them?

722
00:57:04,567 --> 00:57:08,070
Hey, Luci, do up your pockets!

723
00:57:14,994 --> 00:57:17,538
- Iris.
- Which way are you going?

724
00:57:20,291 --> 00:57:22,543
Trying to be clever, eh?

725
00:57:23,627 --> 00:57:25,504
Iris!

726
00:57:28,716 --> 00:57:30,593
Nice time to find a taxi.

727
00:57:30,634 --> 00:57:33,179
If your mother wasn't worse than you,
she'd have strangled you.

728
00:57:33,262 --> 00:57:35,556
I know, but don't spit in my face.

729
00:57:35,598 --> 00:57:36,640
What are you doing?!

730
00:57:36,682 --> 00:57:41,437
It's not a good idea at your age.
It's not advisable.

731
00:57:41,478 --> 00:57:42,938
Taxi!

732
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:45,107
Ciao. Go to bed. Go on.

733
00:57:48,194 --> 00:57:49,361
Happy New Year, eh?

734
00:57:49,403 --> 00:57:52,573
Augusto, do you want to come with us?

735
00:57:55,451 --> 00:57:57,244
Come on.

736
00:57:59,997 --> 00:58:01,624
No, good night.

737
00:58:10,341 --> 00:58:11,467
Iris!

738
00:58:13,344 --> 00:58:15,012
Iris!

739
00:58:15,971 --> 00:58:17,431
Iris!

740
00:58:18,557 --> 00:58:23,103
What kind of joke was that?
A cigarette case!

741
00:58:24,355 --> 00:58:26,440
He must have been drunk.

742
00:58:26,482 --> 00:58:28,901
He was definitely drunk.

743
00:58:31,946 --> 00:58:33,906
Do you want a cigarette?

744
00:58:33,948 --> 00:58:38,285
What are you doing
with those people?

745
00:58:38,369 --> 00:58:42,665
- What are you up to?
- Nothing. We work.

746
00:58:42,706 --> 00:58:46,669
What do you do with Roberto and
the other one? What sort of work?

747
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:51,549
What do you think? You know
I always tell you everything.

748
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:55,094
I never know anything!
You never tell me the truth!

749
00:59:02,268 --> 00:59:07,398
I'm not like them, you know.
Do you think I want to be ruined?

750
00:59:08,524 --> 00:59:11,318
I work. I don't do anything wrong.

751
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:14,864
I have to do something
to keep you both.

752
00:59:14,905 --> 00:59:19,910
You have to be a thief?!
You'll end up in jail!

753
00:59:19,952 --> 00:59:22,246
Iris, please...

754
00:59:24,623 --> 00:59:30,171
Iris, it's New Year's!
Let's not begin the year like this!

755
00:59:30,212 --> 00:59:32,840
I knew straightaway
what they were like.

756
00:59:32,882 --> 00:59:36,677
How many times have I told you?
And you... nothing. Just lies!

757
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:40,431
You go away, you come back, I never
know where you get the money from.

758
00:59:40,472 --> 00:59:42,725
Nothing but trouble!

759
00:59:42,766 --> 00:59:47,980
And every time I hear the doorbell
it stabs me in the heart.

760
00:59:48,772 --> 00:59:50,983
I can't stand it anymore.

761
00:59:52,359 --> 00:59:54,778
I can't stand it anymore.

762
00:59:56,197 --> 00:59:59,992
Iris, please, don't be like this.

763
01:00:00,034 --> 01:00:01,952
I beg you, calm down!

764
01:00:05,497 --> 01:00:10,878
I love you, Iris!
I'll do anything you want! I promise!

765
01:00:15,132 --> 01:00:19,470
I won't go round with them anymore.
They won't see me ever again.

766
01:00:20,888 --> 01:00:26,268
I'll find a way of earning.
I'll sell my paintings.

767
01:00:26,310 --> 01:00:28,145
I don't believe you any longer.

768
01:00:28,187 --> 01:00:30,272
You're right, I know.

769
01:00:31,482 --> 01:00:34,693
I promise you,
I'll turn over a new leaf.

770
01:00:34,777 --> 01:00:38,280
I swear, Iris. Believe me, darling!

771
01:00:38,364 --> 01:00:40,533
You're always saying these things.

772
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:46,247
Yes, I know.
But I've only got you and the child.

773
01:00:46,288 --> 01:00:48,666
I only think of you two.

774
01:00:55,631 --> 01:01:00,719
You know I don't mind
having no money. I'm not scared.

775
01:01:00,803 --> 01:01:05,266
I just want you to stay with me,
like when we were first married.

776
01:01:09,144 --> 01:01:11,188
Now you kiss my hand!

777
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:13,941
- Do you want a cigarette now?
- Yes.

778
01:01:16,026 --> 01:01:19,363
You'll see one of these days
what I'll do to you.

779
01:01:20,865 --> 01:01:22,658
You just laugh.

780
01:01:23,534 --> 01:01:26,328
Anyway, happy New Year.

781
01:01:28,747 --> 01:01:31,917
Let's go and see
what's happening over there.

782
01:01:44,388 --> 01:01:47,016
Hey! Happy New Year.
Where are you going?

783
01:01:47,057 --> 01:01:49,685
Hang on a minute. Come with us.

784
01:01:50,769 --> 01:01:53,689
There's no better way
to start the new year.

785
01:01:53,731 --> 01:01:57,484
We'll bring you luck, we will!
Come on!

786
01:01:58,110 --> 01:01:59,737
Goodbye!

787
01:02:48,035 --> 01:02:50,621
Hey, big belly!

788
01:02:50,663 --> 01:02:52,206
Augusto!

789
01:02:54,708 --> 01:02:58,420
Augusto! Over here! Come here!

790
01:03:00,381 --> 01:03:03,175
Have you seen? What a gem!

791
01:03:03,217 --> 01:03:06,345
- Whose is this car?
- Come on, get in!

792
01:03:06,387 --> 01:03:08,681
Wouldn't you like to know?

793
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:13,018
But my mystery is locked in me...

794
01:03:15,896 --> 01:03:17,565
There he is! Picasso!

795
01:03:26,824 --> 01:03:29,618
What a fantastic car!
Are we going in this?

796
01:03:29,702 --> 01:03:32,705
Where are the coats?
Let me try one on.

797
01:03:33,789 --> 01:03:37,084
Put it on carefully -
they're a bit flimsy.

798
01:03:37,126 --> 01:03:40,129
They cost 1,600 each!

799
01:03:40,171 --> 01:03:43,340
But they make a good impression.
1,600 lire is 1,600 lire.

800
01:03:43,382 --> 01:03:45,634
They've conned you, you know.

801
01:03:45,676 --> 01:03:47,261
They're not expensive.

802
01:03:47,303 --> 01:03:51,140
Next time, YOU go. You're an artist,
you'll negotiate better.

803
01:03:51,223 --> 01:03:54,018
But buttons cost what they cost.

804
01:03:54,059 --> 01:03:57,897
Don't fold your arms. Hands out of
your pockets. Don't wake the moths.

805
01:03:57,938 --> 01:03:59,899
It smells of rats!

806
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:02,860
Augusto, please,
go and get some cigarettes.

807
01:04:02,902 --> 01:04:06,280
How much does this car cost
to hire per day?

808
01:04:06,322 --> 01:04:10,993
Zero point zero. It belongs
to the old hag. She's conked out.

809
01:04:11,035 --> 01:04:13,245
Augusto, the cigarettes!
Get a move on.

810
01:04:19,043 --> 01:04:23,130
I told him - Professore,
this isn't part of the syllabus.

811
01:04:23,172 --> 01:04:24,131
Papà!

812
01:04:27,426 --> 01:04:30,221
- Patrizia!
- Papà!

813
01:04:31,305 --> 01:04:33,891
You've changed.
I wouldn't have recognised you!

814
01:04:33,933 --> 01:04:36,018
It is you, isn't it?

815
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:38,938
- What are you doing?
- I'm coming.

816
01:04:38,979 --> 01:04:41,815
Isn't there any school today?

817
01:04:41,857 --> 01:04:45,110
There was no maths
so we left an hour early.

818
01:04:45,152 --> 01:04:47,029
Are you going for a walk?

819
01:04:47,071 --> 01:04:48,322
Yes.

820
01:04:50,407 --> 01:04:52,034
And your mamma?

821
01:04:52,076 --> 01:04:54,870
She's fine.
She had flu but now she's better.

822
01:04:58,541 --> 01:05:03,379
You've really changed.
You're a lady now.

823
01:05:05,005 --> 01:05:07,299
I haven't seen you
since last Christmas.

824
01:05:07,341 --> 01:05:09,385
Patrizia!

825
01:05:09,426 --> 01:05:12,555
Just a minute, I'm coming!

826
01:05:12,596 --> 01:05:15,558
Go on, they're waiting for you.

827
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:19,270
One of these days I'll come
and see you. Or I'll phone you.

828
01:05:19,311 --> 01:05:20,980
All right.

829
01:05:21,021 --> 01:05:23,315
No, I mean it. I promise.

830
01:05:23,399 --> 01:05:24,692
Yes, yes.

831
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:28,988
Ciao, Patrizia!

832
01:05:29,029 --> 01:05:30,447
Ciao, Papà.

833
01:06:06,692 --> 01:06:08,485
Good morning, gentlemen!

834
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:11,530
Hello, boy! Ten litres.

835
01:06:11,614 --> 01:06:13,824
- Super?
- Superissimo!

836
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:32,009
Nice for some. Do nothing from
dawn to dusk and earn a bomb!

837
01:06:32,092 --> 01:06:34,053
- Am I right?
- Of course!

838
01:06:34,136 --> 01:06:38,057
In fact, all the land
round here is mine!

839
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:40,309
If you only knew, sir!

840
01:06:41,477 --> 01:06:45,648
Damn it, once a man
has worked his whole life,

841
01:06:45,689 --> 01:06:50,444
he should have the right to let up!
What hours do you work?

842
01:06:50,486 --> 01:06:52,488
There aren't any hours.

843
01:06:52,530 --> 01:06:55,658
If you want to eat every day,
you have to be here at night too.

844
01:06:57,576 --> 01:06:58,953
Oil? Water?

845
01:06:58,994 --> 01:07:02,456
No, check the tyres.
See if they're okay.

846
01:07:04,792 --> 01:07:05,918
How much is it?

847
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:07,878
1,380 lire.

848
01:07:09,255 --> 01:07:12,132
Fine. But I'm not
going to pay you.

849
01:07:12,174 --> 01:07:18,097
We're broke, and I have to be
at the Terni prefecture by 12.30.

850
01:07:18,138 --> 01:07:21,767
You know what we'll do?

851
01:07:21,809 --> 01:07:25,437
I owe you 1, 380.
You give me 10,000.

852
01:07:25,479 --> 01:07:28,065
This evening, on my way back,
I'll give you 13,000.

853
01:07:28,107 --> 01:07:31,026
Come on, what do you say?

854
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:35,030
What do you mean?

855
01:07:35,072 --> 01:07:36,490
What? Out with it.

856
01:07:36,532 --> 01:07:38,993
I only asked what you meant.

857
01:07:39,034 --> 01:07:41,620
You don't trust me?
Go on, say you don't trust me!

858
01:07:41,662 --> 01:07:45,124
No, I trust you.
It's just I don't understand.

859
01:07:45,165 --> 01:07:47,543
I'll give you my coat.
Have you heard this?

860
01:07:47,585 --> 01:07:49,962
He wants my coat!

861
01:07:50,004 --> 01:07:52,673
It's not that I don't trust you.

862
01:07:52,715 --> 01:07:54,216
Let's give him the coat.

863
01:07:54,258 --> 01:07:55,968
Will that do as a deposit?

864
01:07:56,010 --> 01:07:57,303
Yes.

865
01:07:57,344 --> 01:07:58,470
Roberto! Roberto!

866
01:07:58,512 --> 01:08:02,683
Have you told him you're leaving him
a coat worth at least 50,000 lire?

867
01:08:02,725 --> 01:08:05,811
Poor wretch! He doesn't trust me.

868
01:08:05,895 --> 01:08:09,481
You never want to see me again.
Don't touch with those oily hands!

869
01:08:09,565 --> 01:08:11,483
Here. Wait a minute!

870
01:08:11,525 --> 01:08:14,904
This would be a bit much.
My watch!

871
01:08:14,945 --> 01:08:17,072
You would have got a bargain!

872
01:08:17,114 --> 01:08:19,200
I trust you because
you're a signore.

873
01:08:19,241 --> 01:08:21,160
Thank you. I'm leaving you this.

874
01:08:21,202 --> 01:08:23,370
Show me
where you're going to put it.

875
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:29,835
He's a friend, the old chap!

876
01:08:43,307 --> 01:08:46,101
- Morning.
- Good morning.

877
01:08:46,143 --> 01:08:47,228
Petrol?

878
01:08:47,269 --> 01:08:49,355
Ten of super.

879
01:08:49,396 --> 01:08:51,690
- Is the tank behind there?
- Yes.

880
01:09:14,755 --> 01:09:18,133
Olé! Olé! Attention, messieurs!
S'il vous plait!

881
01:09:25,474 --> 01:09:27,476
Look, let's try our strength!

882
01:09:29,603 --> 01:09:32,606
- Shall we have a go?
- Of course!

883
01:09:32,648 --> 01:09:35,025
Augusto, do you remember this song?

884
01:09:35,067 --> 01:09:37,069
Test your muscles!

885
01:09:53,085 --> 01:09:57,339
Hey, let's go and see
the medieval fortress!

886
01:09:57,381 --> 01:09:59,466
Cut it out, stupid!

887
01:10:01,218 --> 01:10:03,846
Can you hear that idiot?

888
01:10:03,888 --> 01:10:04,889
Quiet...

889
01:10:06,307 --> 01:10:08,517
It's a stable.

890
01:10:08,559 --> 01:10:13,647
Are there really no women in this village?
There's not even one!

891
01:10:13,689 --> 01:10:15,316
Hey, women!

892
01:10:15,357 --> 01:10:18,611
Imagine the people who live here!
You'd shoot yourself!

893
01:10:18,652 --> 01:10:23,699
Ladies and gentlemen,
pure English wool! Guaranteed.

894
01:10:23,741 --> 01:10:25,159
Pure wool - super-resistant!

895
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:29,413
Indestructible!

896
01:10:29,455 --> 01:10:36,003
Hey! Mind the bullfight!
Ready for the bull? Olé!

897
01:10:36,045 --> 01:10:38,631
Mind out or you'll
do your head in!

898
01:10:41,842 --> 01:10:44,136
He made it. It's all right.

899
01:11:17,336 --> 01:11:22,424
We need something more serious.
We can't go on like this.

900
01:11:22,466 --> 01:11:25,094
Who wants to go on like this?

901
01:11:25,135 --> 01:11:30,683
I'm not stupid. This is just
a bit of fun to keep us going.

902
01:11:30,724 --> 01:11:32,184
I can sing.

903
01:11:32,226 --> 01:11:35,604
As soon as I've put a bit of money aside,
I'm going to study.

904
01:11:35,646 --> 01:11:40,276
I've already bought all Johnny Ray's
records. He's really my style!

905
01:11:40,317 --> 01:11:42,862
You'll never study.

906
01:11:42,903 --> 01:11:48,742
I don't want to end up like you.
I've got your example, old boy.

907
01:11:51,871 --> 01:11:54,331
Augusto!

908
01:11:54,373 --> 01:11:56,876
Come and have a look.

909
01:11:56,959 --> 01:11:59,587
Picasso! Cut it out!

910
01:12:03,174 --> 01:12:05,759
Come on. I'll pay for everyone.

911
01:12:05,801 --> 01:12:07,678
How much will it cost?

912
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:09,763
- Come on!
- No, I want to go for a spin.

913
01:12:09,805 --> 01:12:12,057
Where are you taking me?

914
01:12:12,099 --> 01:12:16,395
- Stop it!
- Look at the state you're in!

915
01:12:17,730 --> 01:12:20,858
Augusto, how much
would a merry-go-round cost?

916
01:12:21,942 --> 01:12:24,612
Roberto, a merry-go-round...

917
01:12:26,530 --> 01:12:29,033
See what happens
when you let him drink!

918
01:12:29,074 --> 01:12:30,492
I don't feel well.

919
01:12:30,534 --> 01:12:34,371
I let him drink?! Two glasses.
He's a lightweight!

920
01:12:34,413 --> 01:12:36,415
Two glasses! More like a bottle.

921
01:12:36,457 --> 01:12:38,292
Leave him there! Leave him!

922
01:12:38,334 --> 01:12:39,627
Let me stay here.

923
01:12:39,668 --> 01:12:42,755
You know that a whiff of wine
is enough to set him off.

924
01:12:42,796 --> 01:12:46,091
Is this what you call fun?

925
01:12:46,133 --> 01:12:48,010
Come and wash your face.

926
01:12:49,053 --> 01:12:50,554
Come on!

927
01:12:52,348 --> 01:12:54,558
Come on, hit him over the head!

928
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:55,976
Stop it!

929
01:12:56,894 --> 01:12:58,562
Leave me alone!

930
01:13:00,898 --> 01:13:02,441
You two...

931
01:13:03,609 --> 01:13:05,236
You two...

932
01:13:06,070 --> 01:13:09,823
You two, leave me alone.

933
01:13:09,907 --> 01:13:12,910
- Hey, hey, you!
- Where are you off to now?

934
01:13:12,952 --> 01:13:14,995
- To ask something.
- Wait for us.

935
01:13:15,037 --> 01:13:17,039
Leave me alone.

936
01:13:19,834 --> 01:13:22,419
Go away! You too, Augusto!

937
01:13:22,461 --> 01:13:24,421
Go away!

938
01:13:29,885 --> 01:13:31,762
How do you feel?

939
01:13:33,389 --> 01:13:35,266
I feel bad.

940
01:13:37,935 --> 01:13:41,105
You two do what you want.

941
01:13:41,981 --> 01:13:45,234
I'm going home.

942
01:13:45,276 --> 01:13:49,113
You can go to Florence.
Don't worry about me.

943
01:13:49,154 --> 01:13:54,493
I want to go home. There must be
a train that passes through here.

944
01:13:54,535 --> 01:13:56,996
Where are you going?
You can hardly stand up.

945
01:13:59,874 --> 01:14:02,418
Come here, take this thing off.

946
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:07,006
Have a walk and you'll feel better.

947
01:14:16,432 --> 01:14:21,312
One of these days
I won't have a home anymore.

948
01:14:21,353 --> 01:14:24,732
I can't keep going around
with you two.

949
01:14:24,773 --> 01:14:26,775
Iris suspects something.

950
01:14:26,817 --> 01:14:29,820
She's always asking questions.

951
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,992
I can't keep telling her
all these lies.

952
01:14:37,494 --> 01:14:43,083
One of these days she'll take
the child and go back to her mother.

953
01:14:43,125 --> 01:14:45,044
She will!

954
01:14:46,128 --> 01:14:49,381
And if she takes my little girl...

955
01:14:50,799 --> 01:14:53,594
I'll kill myself!

956
01:14:57,056 --> 01:15:00,851
This is what happens
when you get married at 18.

957
01:15:00,893 --> 01:15:04,522
Don't you see? You're finished!

958
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:10,402
Get another job
while there's still time.

959
01:15:10,444 --> 01:15:12,530
Find something better.

960
01:15:18,786 --> 01:15:19,995
Why?

961
01:15:20,037 --> 01:15:24,458
But I've got the right face.

962
01:15:25,501 --> 01:15:31,382
Look. You've always said that
with this face I can fool anyone.

963
01:15:31,423 --> 01:15:34,969
I look like an angel.

964
01:15:37,763 --> 01:15:42,643
Leave me anywhere in the world,
even where I don't know anyone,

965
01:15:42,685 --> 01:15:45,104
and I'd always fall on my feet.

966
01:15:46,564 --> 01:15:48,065
Say, "A million".

967
01:15:52,444 --> 01:15:54,530
Come on, you heard, say, "A million".

968
01:15:57,491 --> 01:15:59,827
A millio...

969
01:16:01,370 --> 01:16:06,542
You can't even say it,
let alone imagine a million!

970
01:16:06,584 --> 01:16:09,962
Whatever money you earn,
you take to your wife, you fool!

971
01:16:10,045 --> 01:16:12,256
Augusto...

972
01:16:12,339 --> 01:16:14,967
In our line of work,
you can't have a family.

973
01:16:15,009 --> 01:16:18,304
You have to be free
to come and go as you please,

974
01:16:18,345 --> 01:16:21,056
not be tied
to your wife's apron-strings!

975
01:16:21,098 --> 01:16:23,434
You have to be alone.

976
01:16:23,475 --> 01:16:27,271
When you're young,
you have to be free -

977
01:16:27,313 --> 01:16:30,399
it's even more important
than the air that you breathe.

978
01:16:31,317 --> 01:16:33,444
If you're scared now,

979
01:16:35,029 --> 01:16:38,157
wait till you're my age.

980
01:16:40,242 --> 01:16:42,286
The years pass.

981
01:16:45,664 --> 01:16:47,499
Come on, up you get.

982
01:16:48,918 --> 01:16:51,170
Come on.

983
01:16:55,299 --> 01:16:57,760
The walk will do you good.

984
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:04,642
- Better now?
- Yes, better.

985
01:17:04,683 --> 01:17:08,145
I'm not coming to Florence, though.
I'm going home.

986
01:17:08,187 --> 01:17:12,066
Oh, come on, we'll have fun -
we'll make a packet.

987
01:17:12,107 --> 01:17:14,568
No, I'm going home.

988
01:17:15,945 --> 01:17:18,822
Augusto, how do you do it?

989
01:17:18,864 --> 01:17:22,993
I admire you, you know -
I wish I had your courage...

990
01:17:23,035 --> 01:17:27,540
But how can you go on like this
at your age?

991
01:17:27,581 --> 01:17:30,709
Are you never afraid?

992
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:36,173
Afraid of what?

993
01:17:39,802 --> 01:17:43,973
No, I'm not like you. I...

994
01:17:46,725 --> 01:17:49,687
Hey, it's starting to rain!

995
01:17:49,728 --> 01:17:52,022
Augusto!

996
01:17:52,064 --> 01:17:54,400
Picasso! Voici Miss Frosinone!

997
01:17:54,441 --> 01:17:56,277
Look at Roberto!

998
01:17:56,318 --> 01:17:59,738
Have you seen
what kind of friend I am?

999
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:01,866
Wait! Come on.

1000
01:18:05,369 --> 01:18:07,246
Augusto, where are you going?

1001
01:18:07,329 --> 01:18:08,789
Come on!

1002
01:18:08,873 --> 01:18:11,584
Picasso, come on! Hurry up!

1003
01:18:11,625 --> 01:18:14,003
Look at the girl I've met!

1004
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:23,470
Signora Luigina, a local gentlewoman.
Augusto, our spiritual grandfather.

1005
01:18:23,512 --> 01:18:26,932
The signora has expressed
the desire to take a romantic stroll.

1006
01:18:26,974 --> 01:18:29,560
Keep your hands to yourself!
Everyone knows me here.

1007
01:18:29,643 --> 01:18:32,980
What do you want? Oh, just a minute.

1008
01:18:33,063 --> 01:18:34,607
I was asleep.

1009
01:18:34,648 --> 01:18:38,235
We haven't got long.
My husband comes home at midnight.

1010
01:18:38,277 --> 01:18:40,321
Let's go. It's raining.

1011
01:18:40,362 --> 01:18:42,489
- What's your husband doing?
- Working.

1012
01:18:42,531 --> 01:18:44,325
Nice car!

1013
01:18:46,243 --> 01:18:49,330
- Thank you, Amilcare.
- Signora.

1014
01:18:50,164 --> 01:18:54,126
Where do you think you're going?
What are you up to?

1015
01:18:56,295 --> 01:19:01,675
Picassino, go and get some sleep.
We'll see you tomorrow morning.

1016
01:19:01,717 --> 01:19:02,843
Ciao!

1017
01:19:08,516 --> 01:19:10,726
This is cosy!

1018
01:19:10,768 --> 01:19:14,438
There's even a radio.
Can you turn it on?

1019
01:19:36,794 --> 01:19:38,712
Home...

1020
01:19:38,796 --> 01:19:40,840
Yes, I'm going home.

1021
01:19:40,881 --> 01:19:43,342
I'm going home.

1022
01:20:11,662 --> 01:20:15,416
Have you been waiting long?

1023
01:20:15,457 --> 01:20:17,084
No, you're right on time.

1024
01:20:17,126 --> 01:20:19,170
Let me have a look at you.

1025
01:20:20,629 --> 01:20:22,173
Very smart!

1026
01:20:23,424 --> 01:20:24,967
Hang on.

1027
01:20:25,009 --> 01:20:26,844
There's no need...

1028
01:20:27,761 --> 01:20:29,096
Thank you.

1029
01:20:31,515 --> 01:20:35,978
It's a lovely day. Why don't we
go and eat at Monte Mario?

1030
01:20:35,978 --> 01:20:38,105
Let's go.

1031
01:20:38,147 --> 01:20:39,815
Or a restaurant in town?

1032
01:20:39,857 --> 01:20:42,276
I don't mind as long as
I'm back home by seven.

1033
01:20:42,318 --> 01:20:44,195
In that case, Monte Mario.

1034
01:20:45,696 --> 01:20:47,615
I've put on weight, haven't I?

1035
01:20:47,656 --> 01:20:49,617
No, you're just fine.

1036
01:20:51,243 --> 01:20:53,162
Do you know how old I am? 48.

1037
01:20:53,245 --> 01:20:55,623
That's not so old.

1038
01:20:58,751 --> 01:21:01,212
What will you do
when you've finished school?

1039
01:21:01,253 --> 01:21:04,798
I've got to decide
whether to continue or stop.

1040
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:08,761
It would mean four years of university.
That's a bit long.

1041
01:21:08,802 --> 01:21:12,306
What's wrong,
don't you like studying?

1042
01:21:12,348 --> 01:21:14,934
Yes, I do. I'd like to continue.

1043
01:21:14,975 --> 01:21:18,979
Mamma would like me to, too,
but I can't keep burdening her.

1044
01:21:25,945 --> 01:21:28,239
After university, what would you do?

1045
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:29,865
- Teach.
- What?

1046
01:21:29,907 --> 01:21:32,284
- I'd teach.
- Would you like that?

1047
01:21:32,326 --> 01:21:37,122
Yes. I want to find a job in my spare time
so I can pay for my studies.

1048
01:21:37,164 --> 01:21:40,835
Lots of my friends do.
One friend works as a cashier.

1049
01:21:40,918 --> 01:21:44,964
- And how much does a cashier earn?
- 30, 35.

1050
01:21:45,005 --> 01:21:46,632
- How much?!
- 35.

1051
01:21:46,674 --> 01:21:52,012
35,000 lire! What can you do with that?!
No-one can live on that!

1052
01:21:52,054 --> 01:21:55,182
That's what the pay is,
more or less.

1053
01:21:55,224 --> 01:21:57,184
A lot of people live like that.

1054
01:21:57,226 --> 01:21:59,436
Here's the dessert and Cognac.

1055
01:22:00,896 --> 01:22:04,692
Young people have to earn a living.

1056
01:22:04,775 --> 01:22:10,114
But to work as a cashier you need
a deposit of 300,000 lire.

1057
01:22:10,155 --> 01:22:11,782
Who's got that?

1058
01:22:14,451 --> 01:22:16,620
Oh! That's lovely!

1059
01:22:18,205 --> 01:22:20,332
- Really lovely!
- Do you like it?

1060
01:22:20,374 --> 01:22:22,084
It's lovely!

1061
01:22:23,085 --> 01:22:25,212
- Keep it. It's yours.
- It's a bit much for me.

1062
01:22:25,296 --> 01:22:26,755
Don't be silly. It's nothing.

1063
01:22:26,839 --> 01:22:33,345
Be careful when you wind it up,
though, because... it's very fragile.

1064
01:22:35,347 --> 01:22:37,725
Thank you, Papà. It's really lovely.

1065
01:22:37,766 --> 01:22:39,268
Waiter, the bill, please!

1066
01:22:43,063 --> 01:22:44,607
There, look.

1067
01:22:44,690 --> 01:22:48,527
- It's a bit far back.
- We're better off there.

1068
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:05,961
They thought we were a couple!

1069
01:23:09,465 --> 01:23:11,509
- Can you see?
- Yes.

1070
01:23:13,511 --> 01:23:17,681
If you go on studying,
I'll see to that deposit.

1071
01:23:17,723 --> 01:23:21,727
2- or 300,000 lire is nothing to me.
I can find that no problem.

1072
01:23:21,769 --> 01:23:23,187
Oh, Papà!

1073
01:23:35,658 --> 01:23:37,493
- Do you want an ice cream?
- Yes, thank you.

1074
01:23:37,535 --> 01:23:39,161
Two ice creams.

1075
01:23:39,203 --> 01:23:41,956
On Sunday we'll go out together.

1076
01:23:41,997 --> 01:23:43,082
All right.

1077
01:23:45,376 --> 01:23:46,669
Thank you.

1078
01:23:55,010 --> 01:23:56,637
Ice cream, sweets!

1079
01:24:03,602 --> 01:24:06,313
What's wrong? Don't you feel well?

1080
01:24:06,355 --> 01:24:07,731
It's nothing.

1081
01:24:07,773 --> 01:24:09,316
Ice cream!

1082
01:24:28,294 --> 01:24:30,421
I'm going to get some cigarettes.

1083
01:24:46,687 --> 01:24:48,147
Hello. How are you?

1084
01:24:48,189 --> 01:24:50,941
Been looking for you for six months.

1085
01:24:50,983 --> 01:24:52,818
Can't we talk tomorrow?

1086
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:55,696
Tomorrow! No, we'll talk now!

1087
01:24:55,738 --> 01:24:58,115
- I'll tell you now!
- Please...!

1088
01:24:58,157 --> 01:25:02,077
Scum! I'll unbung your ears
once and for all, you crook!

1089
01:25:02,119 --> 01:25:04,121
Go outside and argue!

1090
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:09,793
- Look who it is!
- There he is. Well done!

1091
01:25:14,423 --> 01:25:16,550
Can we go outside, please?

1092
01:25:22,806 --> 01:25:24,683
Why do I have to go
to the police station?

1093
01:25:24,767 --> 01:25:27,228
He's still asking me
what he's done!

1094
01:25:27,269 --> 01:25:30,189
Sort it out at the police station.

1095
01:25:30,231 --> 01:25:32,691
I'll break his bones!

1096
01:25:32,733 --> 01:25:34,485
- Excuse me!
- What's going on?

1097
01:25:34,527 --> 01:25:36,111
Please, let me go.

1098
01:25:37,530 --> 01:25:40,032
- What's going on?
- You know what this murderer did?

1099
01:25:40,074 --> 01:25:44,203
He sold me fake terramycin
and nearly killed my brother.

1100
01:25:44,245 --> 01:25:47,331
- Stop it!
- Calm down!

1101
01:25:47,414 --> 01:25:51,252
- That's enough!
- Thief? Me?!

1102
01:25:51,293 --> 01:25:52,378
Papà!

1103
01:25:52,461 --> 01:25:54,547
What's he done?

1104
01:25:54,588 --> 01:25:56,257
Cut it out!

1105
01:25:56,298 --> 01:25:58,592
Let's go to the police station.
Come on!

1106
01:26:03,222 --> 01:26:05,099
- Let's go!
- Go home.

1107
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:09,103
You can sort it out
at the police station. Let's go!

1108
01:26:09,144 --> 01:26:11,063
Go home!

1109
01:26:22,241 --> 01:26:23,534
Sergeant!

1110
01:26:25,786 --> 01:26:27,872
Keep back! Keep back!

1111
01:27:11,457 --> 01:27:14,210
Well, what are you going to do now?

1112
01:27:14,251 --> 01:27:16,670
I haven't got a clue!

1113
01:27:16,712 --> 01:27:19,381
- Could you give me a cigarette?
- Of course.

1114
01:27:19,423 --> 01:27:23,219
Make sure you don't
end up in here again.

1115
01:27:29,391 --> 01:27:31,936
- Thanks. Ciao.
- Ciao, and good luck.

1116
01:27:46,075 --> 01:27:48,410
And let them kidnap my mother?!

1117
01:27:49,495 --> 01:27:50,955
No, no.

1118
01:27:50,996 --> 01:27:53,541
I won't be in Rome this week.

1119
01:27:54,458 --> 01:27:55,960
The lawyer.

1120
01:27:56,961 --> 01:27:58,587
The lawyer's been arrested.

1121
01:27:59,421 --> 01:28:02,883
How should I know?
Something to do with signatures.

1122
01:28:04,301 --> 01:28:05,845
Okay.

1123
01:28:06,512 --> 01:28:07,596
Okay.

1124
01:28:08,389 --> 01:28:09,557
Hello.

1125
01:28:09,598 --> 01:28:12,309
Look who's back again!
What will it be? Cognac?

1126
01:28:12,351 --> 01:28:13,561
No, a Negroni.

1127
01:28:13,602 --> 01:28:16,522
Where've you been all this time?
Out of Rome?

1128
01:28:19,942 --> 01:28:22,027
Have you seen Roberto this morning?

1129
01:28:22,069 --> 01:28:25,573
The fair-haired one?
It's a while since I've seen him.

1130
01:28:25,614 --> 01:28:27,074
Ciao.

1131
01:28:28,659 --> 01:28:31,453
- Roberto who? Roberto Giorgio?
- Yes.

1132
01:28:31,537 --> 01:28:33,122
He's in Milan.

1133
01:28:33,163 --> 01:28:34,498
Since when?

1134
01:28:36,125 --> 01:28:37,960
It must be three months.

1135
01:28:38,002 --> 01:28:39,587
What's he doing in Milan?

1136
01:28:39,628 --> 01:28:43,549
He's doing fine.
I saw him with an Aurelia Sport.

1137
01:28:43,591 --> 01:28:45,134
Yes, an Aurelia Sport.

1138
01:28:45,176 --> 01:28:48,137
And Barone Vargas.
Have you seen him?

1139
01:28:48,179 --> 01:28:49,972
I saw him yesterday, but not today.

1140
01:28:50,014 --> 01:28:51,682
But he still comes here?

1141
01:28:51,765 --> 01:28:53,309
Not so often.

1142
01:28:53,392 --> 01:28:55,436
Pay at the till.

1143
01:29:49,907 --> 01:29:52,034
Good morning!

1144
01:29:52,076 --> 01:29:54,537
- Are you Paolo Gazzese?
- Yes.

1145
01:29:54,578 --> 01:29:59,792
Monsignore, it's him. We have
something very important to discuss.

1146
01:30:01,794 --> 01:30:03,420
There's a bone here!

1147
01:30:03,462 --> 01:30:07,299
Monsignore! A bone!

1148
01:30:07,341 --> 01:30:10,052
And there's even a skull! Look!

1149
01:30:32,157 --> 01:30:35,119
It weighs a ton! Give me a hand!

1150
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:37,204
I could do with a coffee.

1151
01:30:37,246 --> 01:30:39,540
Me too.

1152
01:30:44,712 --> 01:30:47,923
Susanna, what are you doing here?
Go into the other room.

1153
01:30:48,007 --> 01:30:51,093
Very sorry, Monsignore.

1154
01:30:51,177 --> 01:30:56,140
Monsignore, this is my daughter.
Ah, Renata, take her through there.

1155
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:07,193
It's my younger daughter, poor thing.
God made her like that.

1156
01:31:11,030 --> 01:31:13,949
- Come on.
- 'Scuse us.

1157
01:31:15,159 --> 01:31:17,411
I've got the list of the treasure.

1158
01:31:18,204 --> 01:31:20,497
There must be something in here...

1159
01:31:20,539 --> 01:31:22,625
Oh, no, I've done it.

1160
01:31:24,502 --> 01:31:27,338
What is this?! The Bank of Italy?

1161
01:31:27,379 --> 01:31:29,632
Look at that. Monsignore.

1162
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:33,594
As I said...

1163
01:31:34,887 --> 01:31:37,014
the treasure is all yours.

1164
01:31:39,391 --> 01:31:42,937
The deceased left precise
instructions as to the conditions.

1165
01:31:42,978 --> 01:31:48,275
But what you've got to remember
is not to mention it to anyone.

1166
01:31:48,317 --> 01:31:51,695
Monsignore!
Please, please. Don't worry.

1167
01:31:51,737 --> 01:31:58,369
The gentleman hasn't got the whole
sum needed for the masses here.

1168
01:31:58,452 --> 01:32:01,413
- He's only got... How much?
- 350,000 lire.

1169
01:32:01,455 --> 01:32:04,208
350,000 lire.
What are we going to do?

1170
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:07,837
It doesn't matter.
We're not mercenaries.

1171
01:32:07,878 --> 01:32:10,965
We'll take what you've got.
Give us the rest another time.

1172
01:32:11,006 --> 01:32:15,010
You can come back, Father.
I'll explain to His Eminence.

1173
01:32:15,052 --> 01:32:18,514
I put this money aside because I was
going to go to the fair tomorrow

1174
01:32:18,556 --> 01:32:22,643
to buy a beast
to help with my work.

1175
01:32:22,685 --> 01:32:25,771
I've got to put something aside,

1176
01:32:25,813 --> 01:32:28,566
not for myself
but for those two girls.

1177
01:32:28,607 --> 01:32:34,572
One works like a man but the other,
poor thing, is crippled!

1178
01:32:34,613 --> 01:32:38,450
And when I'm gone,
who'll see to them?

1179
01:32:38,492 --> 01:32:43,664
Go on with you. Don't say that.
God abandons no-one.

1180
01:32:43,747 --> 01:32:47,334
Look what providence has sent you.
Isn't it true, Monsignore?

1181
01:32:47,376 --> 01:32:50,796
Of course! I wish I was
as unlucky as this peasant!

1182
01:32:52,173 --> 01:32:55,551
The Lord doesn't abandon
His creatures.

1183
01:32:55,593 --> 01:32:57,428
Have you got the money?

1184
01:32:57,469 --> 01:32:59,180
Yes, I've got it here.

1185
01:32:59,221 --> 01:33:02,141
Do take it!

1186
01:33:05,728 --> 01:33:07,688
Oh, Monsignore!

1187
01:33:11,567 --> 01:33:15,696
It's getting late, Monsignore.
His Eminence expects us at five.

1188
01:33:15,738 --> 01:33:20,826
It's true, we'd better be off.
Thank you and congratulations.

1189
01:33:28,167 --> 01:33:31,212
Monsignore! Monsignore! Pardon me.

1190
01:33:32,296 --> 01:33:36,217
Would you be kind enough
to speak to my child?

1191
01:33:36,258 --> 01:33:40,179
- But I can't.
- Please, Monsignore! Just a word.

1192
01:33:40,221 --> 01:33:42,348
Wait a moment.

1193
01:33:42,389 --> 01:33:44,975
Thank you! Thank you so much!

1194
01:33:45,017 --> 01:33:47,478
But don't tell her I asked you to.

1195
01:33:49,980 --> 01:33:54,068
The Monsignore wants to say hello.
I'll get a chair, Monsignore.

1196
01:33:54,109 --> 01:33:56,654
No, I have to go.
No, no, stay there.

1197
01:34:09,291 --> 01:34:10,751
What's your name?

1198
01:34:10,793 --> 01:34:12,795
Susanna.

1199
01:34:34,608 --> 01:34:37,319
You have to have faith in God,
child.

1200
01:34:37,361 --> 01:34:42,700
I know it's a terrible thing,
but you have to accept His will.

1201
01:34:42,741 --> 01:34:46,954
This is a valley of tears
and everyone has their own cross to bear.

1202
01:34:47,955 --> 01:34:51,417
Yes, I know. I'm not complaining.

1203
01:34:52,793 --> 01:34:54,378
If it weren't for them.

1204
01:34:56,714 --> 01:34:58,757
What do you mean, "them"?

1205
01:34:58,799 --> 01:35:03,345
If I weren't a burden on my family,
I wouldn't care at all!

1206
01:35:03,429 --> 01:35:05,806
In your state,
you're worried about them?

1207
01:35:05,890 --> 01:35:10,769
She's always got this idea that
she's a burden on us, our daughter!

1208
01:35:10,811 --> 01:35:13,439
Why do you say that?

1209
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:15,524
And it's not true, Monsignore.
She's always working.

1210
01:35:15,566 --> 01:35:17,651
She's better at sums than a teacher.

1211
01:35:17,693 --> 01:35:22,156
And she embroiders! Look what work
she does! Let me show the Monsignore.

1212
01:35:22,198 --> 01:35:24,783
Look what beautiful embroidery!

1213
01:35:24,867 --> 01:35:26,911
She did it.

1214
01:35:28,245 --> 01:35:30,581
Has she always been like that?

1215
01:35:30,623 --> 01:35:34,919
No, Monsignore, it happened
when she was nine. Infant paralysis.

1216
01:35:39,340 --> 01:35:41,926
Mamma. Mamma, go over there.

1217
01:35:47,973 --> 01:35:51,477
- How old are you?
- 18.

1218
01:35:51,519 --> 01:35:54,230
Nine years!

1219
01:35:54,271 --> 01:35:57,566
But I'm fine here!

1220
01:35:57,608 --> 01:36:01,654
I've got my embroidery,
I listen to music.

1221
01:36:04,532 --> 01:36:06,617
I'm like a queen.

1222
01:36:09,870 --> 01:36:12,831
It's for my sister that life's hard.

1223
01:36:13,999 --> 01:36:17,253
She's been working in the fields
since four this morning.

1224
01:36:17,336 --> 01:36:20,047
But wouldn't you like to get better?

1225
01:36:22,883 --> 01:36:27,054
But... it's impossible!

1226
01:36:28,681 --> 01:36:30,266
No...

1227
01:36:33,018 --> 01:36:34,937
It would take a miracle!

1228
01:36:37,523 --> 01:36:39,817
Sometimes miracles do happen.

1229
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:42,945
Oh, yes, I know.

1230
01:36:42,987 --> 01:36:45,322
Do you believe in them?

1231
01:36:47,324 --> 01:36:49,994
Yes, I do.

1232
01:36:50,035 --> 01:36:51,579
Why?

1233
01:36:51,620 --> 01:36:55,666
I don't know why,
but I do believe in them.

1234
01:36:58,586 --> 01:37:02,590
Through my misfortune
I've found God.

1235
01:37:04,133 --> 01:37:06,552
I'm always happy...

1236
01:37:07,261 --> 01:37:10,639
even when I'm in terrible pain.

1237
01:37:23,569 --> 01:37:26,739
This embroidery is beautiful.

1238
01:37:26,780 --> 01:37:28,908
Are you going, Monsignore?

1239
01:37:31,994 --> 01:37:35,789
I have to go now. I have to go.

1240
01:37:41,879 --> 01:37:43,964
You don't need me.

1241
01:37:45,508 --> 01:37:48,886
You're much better off
than a lot of other people.

1242
01:37:50,429 --> 01:37:52,348
Our life...

1243
01:37:53,682 --> 01:37:59,605
the life of so many people I know,
has nothing beautiful in it.

1244
01:38:00,648 --> 01:38:03,108
You're not missing much.

1245
01:38:05,069 --> 01:38:07,655
No, you don't need me.

1246
01:38:08,864 --> 01:38:10,991
And I have nothing to give you.

1247
01:38:13,911 --> 01:38:17,373
Monsignore! Wait! Don't go away!

1248
01:38:32,972 --> 01:38:35,182
Pray for me! Pray for me!

1249
01:38:35,224 --> 01:38:37,643
Let go!

1250
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:21,103
Couldn't you have made that hole
a bit deeper this morning?

1251
01:39:21,187 --> 01:39:24,481
You really made me slave away.

1252
01:39:24,523 --> 01:39:27,484
- Well, how did it go?
- 350,000 lire.

1253
01:39:27,526 --> 01:39:32,406
That's all he had in the house
so we decided to go.

1254
01:39:32,448 --> 01:39:35,492
You did the right thing.
I didn't expect you so soon.

1255
01:39:38,871 --> 01:39:40,748
Who's got the keys?

1256
01:39:40,831 --> 01:39:42,791
He's got them. Give him the keys.

1257
01:39:42,875 --> 01:39:44,585
What's this song called?

1258
01:39:44,627 --> 01:39:48,631
The "Menga" symphony -
the Swindler's symphony.

1259
01:39:50,007 --> 01:39:54,720
You're really overdoing it
with those treasure chests!

1260
01:39:54,762 --> 01:39:57,598
Even an idiot would have realised
it's phoney stuff.

1261
01:39:57,640 --> 01:40:01,852
Remember that time in Viterbo
with those pieces of glass?

1262
01:40:01,894 --> 01:40:05,272
These peasants! What a con!

1263
01:40:05,356 --> 01:40:07,441
What an isolated spot!

1264
01:40:07,483 --> 01:40:10,277
Would you like to have
a nice villa up here, Antô?

1265
01:40:15,282 --> 01:40:17,368
Isn't there an echo here?

1266
01:40:22,289 --> 01:40:25,543
- And the bottle of Cognac?
- I drank the Cognac.

1267
01:40:25,584 --> 01:40:28,629
I was sweating so much,
it's enough to give you pneumonia.

1268
01:40:28,671 --> 01:40:32,132
Since this morning I've had a twinge here.
I told my wife too.

1269
01:40:32,174 --> 01:40:35,636
She said, "You work too hard,"
and it's true.

1270
01:40:35,678 --> 01:40:38,389
- Antonio, where's the bottle?
- Here!

1271
01:40:38,430 --> 01:40:40,641
- What are you doing?
- Adding water.

1272
01:40:40,683 --> 01:40:44,019
I had to come all the way up in second.
You should get rid of it.

1273
01:40:44,061 --> 01:40:47,022
- Who's got the money?
- Augusto.

1274
01:40:53,320 --> 01:40:57,992
You really are a pack of vultures.
I haven't got the money.

1275
01:40:58,033 --> 01:40:59,577
I didn't take it.

1276
01:41:05,791 --> 01:41:07,877
How could I take it?

1277
01:41:07,918 --> 01:41:12,882
You wouldn't even stop
at robbing your own mothers!

1278
01:41:12,923 --> 01:41:15,718
I couldn't do it, Vargas.

1279
01:41:15,759 --> 01:41:18,053
I didn't have the heart.

1280
01:41:18,095 --> 01:41:22,183
He was a poor old wretch
with a crippled daughter.

1281
01:41:22,224 --> 01:41:24,393
He works to keep her out of the hospice.

1282
01:41:24,476 --> 01:41:25,728
What's he saying?

1283
01:41:25,811 --> 01:41:28,647
Augù, I saw when you took it!

1284
01:41:28,689 --> 01:41:30,649
- I gave it back!
- When?

1285
01:41:30,691 --> 01:41:33,903
I gave it back, okay?

1286
01:41:48,209 --> 01:41:50,753
You're the biggest rogue
I've ever met.

1287
01:41:50,794 --> 01:41:54,673
You had 350,000 in your hand
and you let it go? You?

1288
01:41:56,467 --> 01:42:00,513
Have I ever conned you?
I just couldn't do it.

1289
01:42:00,554 --> 01:42:02,640
There's no point in looking.

1290
01:42:02,681 --> 01:42:04,183
Let's have a look.

1291
01:42:04,225 --> 01:42:07,853
I was the one
who had to speak to the girl!

1292
01:42:07,895 --> 01:42:11,607
A poor wretch stuck in a chair
since she was nine

1293
01:42:11,649 --> 01:42:13,692
who knows she'll never get better.

1294
01:42:13,734 --> 01:42:16,654
She looks you in the eye,
kisses your hand,

1295
01:42:16,695 --> 01:42:19,114
asks you to pray for her.

1296
01:42:19,156 --> 01:42:23,202
I'd like to have seen what you'd have done,
if you call yourselves men!

1297
01:42:23,244 --> 01:42:25,829
I've got a daughter.
I couldn't do it.

1298
01:42:25,871 --> 01:42:30,668
All for nothing,
all this effort - we risked jail!

1299
01:42:30,709 --> 01:42:34,380
- Are you out of your mind?
- Can't I have a conscience too?

1300
01:42:34,463 --> 01:42:36,340
That'd be something new!

1301
01:42:38,342 --> 01:42:40,886
Is it really true?

1302
01:42:41,887 --> 01:42:43,806
I swear.

1303
01:42:48,894 --> 01:42:50,187
Let's go.

1304
01:42:50,229 --> 01:42:51,564
Just a moment!

1305
01:42:51,605 --> 01:42:53,357
We're all friends here.

1306
01:42:53,399 --> 01:42:56,902
Fine words. I was moved too,
but I don't believe you! Let me see!

1307
01:42:56,986 --> 01:43:00,239
Get off me! Don't touch me!

1308
01:43:00,322 --> 01:43:03,284
Augù, what are you doing? Come here.

1309
01:43:03,325 --> 01:43:06,787
I was there too, remember?
I was with you too,

1310
01:43:06,829 --> 01:43:08,747
and I saw you take it.

1311
01:43:08,789 --> 01:43:12,293
If you want to have fun, let's have fun.
But that's enough.

1312
01:43:12,334 --> 01:43:13,627
I haven't got the money!

1313
01:43:13,669 --> 01:43:17,590
So if you haven't got it,
why are you bothered?

1314
01:43:17,631 --> 01:43:18,799
Get off me!

1315
01:43:18,883 --> 01:43:23,095
You've hurt my elbow, you scum!

1316
01:43:23,137 --> 01:43:25,514
He's got the money on him!

1317
01:43:25,556 --> 01:43:28,517
Come on, then! Come on!

1318
01:43:30,561 --> 01:43:32,646
You think it's going to end like this?

1319
01:43:39,236 --> 01:43:41,697
What a crook you are!

1320
01:43:41,739 --> 01:43:43,407
Hit him! Break his bones!

1321
01:43:47,077 --> 01:43:51,207
You scum! You wanted to cheat me?

1322
01:43:51,248 --> 01:43:55,044
You'll bring it to me on your knees!

1323
01:44:00,007 --> 01:44:02,301
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

1324
01:44:06,096 --> 01:44:10,392
Where are you going?
Where do you think you're going?

1325
01:44:42,132 --> 01:44:44,051
My back!

1326
01:44:46,345 --> 01:44:48,806
No, stop! My back!

1327
01:44:52,768 --> 01:44:54,645
My back!

1328
01:44:54,687 --> 01:44:56,647
- Where is it?
- Stop!

1329
01:44:56,730 --> 01:44:58,065
Here it is!

1330
01:44:58,107 --> 01:45:00,693
In his shoe! The coward!

1331
01:45:01,318 --> 01:45:03,737
I'll break his back. He's got it!

1332
01:45:04,822 --> 01:45:09,034
That's mine. I need it.
Leave me alone!

1333
01:45:09,076 --> 01:45:11,620
He's got it all on him!

1334
01:45:11,662 --> 01:45:13,873
Where's the money?

1335
01:45:13,914 --> 01:45:16,625
- Here. Count it.
- Swine!

1336
01:45:16,709 --> 01:45:19,253
Here's the money. Filthy coward.

1337
01:45:20,921 --> 01:45:23,632
- Give me the money!
- In his pockets, shoes, everywhere!

1338
01:45:23,674 --> 01:45:26,760
The crippled daughter?

1339
01:45:29,346 --> 01:45:33,559
You're finished working with me.
And now you won't work with anyone else.

1340
01:45:33,601 --> 01:45:36,061
He nearly convinced me!

1341
01:45:36,103 --> 01:45:36,854
Crook!

1342
01:45:36,896 --> 01:45:42,401
Come on. Let's leave him here
to look after himself.

1343
01:45:42,443 --> 01:45:44,570
Scum!

1344
01:45:44,612 --> 01:45:48,240
Vargas, I'm in pain.

1345
01:45:48,282 --> 01:45:49,909
Go to hell!

1346
01:45:49,950 --> 01:45:52,077
Let's go.

1347
01:45:52,578 --> 01:45:57,499
See what friends you've got,
leaving you here in the country?

1348
01:45:57,541 --> 01:46:01,795
What a stupid trick!
The stupidest trick of your life.

1349
01:46:01,879 --> 01:46:05,799
Vargas! Vargas, I'm in pain!

1350
01:46:07,551 --> 01:46:11,514
Who are you trying to kid?

1351
01:46:14,558 --> 01:46:17,770
Vargas! Don't leave me!

1352
01:46:18,562 --> 01:46:22,483
I've hurt myself, really.

1353
01:46:24,151 --> 01:46:26,487
I can't move!

1354
01:46:30,533 --> 01:46:32,076
Riccardo!

1355
01:46:32,117 --> 01:46:34,328
Riccardo, listen!

1356
01:46:35,454 --> 01:46:38,165
- You're my friend.
- Of course!

1357
01:46:38,207 --> 01:46:39,458
Don't leave me here!

1358
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:41,585
You're young!

1359
01:46:43,379 --> 01:46:47,383
I can teach you. I can teach you...

1360
01:46:49,510 --> 01:46:51,387
I can teach you so much.

1361
01:46:51,428 --> 01:46:53,556
What? To be a wretch like you?

1362
01:46:53,597 --> 01:46:55,683
I've got some money stashed away!

1363
01:46:59,603 --> 01:47:02,189
Let's halve it. Don't leave me here!

1364
01:47:04,483 --> 01:47:07,611
Vargas, I know you're there!

1365
01:47:09,822 --> 01:47:12,449
Are you trying to frighten me?

1366
01:47:13,158 --> 01:47:15,452
That's enough now.

1367
01:47:22,501 --> 01:47:23,669
Vargas!

1368
01:47:25,045 --> 01:47:26,088
Vargas!

1369
01:47:38,058 --> 01:47:39,185
Vargas.

1370
01:47:39,977 --> 01:47:41,312
Vargas!

1371
01:47:55,784 --> 01:47:58,204
Of course they'll come back.

1372
01:48:02,374 --> 01:48:04,084
If I die...

1373
01:48:06,420 --> 01:48:08,756
I can't die like this.

1374
01:48:10,716 --> 01:48:14,512
But... if I die...

1375
01:48:17,473 --> 01:48:19,558
Help! Help!

1376
01:48:21,977 --> 01:48:23,312
Help!

1377
01:48:28,692 --> 01:48:31,320
I knew it would end like this.

1378
01:48:32,530 --> 01:48:34,240
I always knew it.

1379
01:48:41,580 --> 01:48:44,458
What's the point of going on?

1380
01:48:45,709 --> 01:48:48,587
I don't have to look after anyone.

1381
01:48:51,257 --> 01:48:54,009
That's why I'm going to die.

1382
01:49:08,566 --> 01:49:10,401
Vargas!

1383
01:49:24,164 --> 01:49:27,626
Oh, Patrizia, my child!

1384
01:50:02,453 --> 01:50:03,746
I'm better now.

1385
01:50:07,583 --> 01:50:09,043
I can do it.

1386
01:50:10,503 --> 01:50:12,379
I can do it.

1387
01:51:45,389 --> 01:51:47,141
Wait for me!

1388
01:51:53,772 --> 01:51:55,649
I'm coming.

1389
01:51:59,445 --> 01:52:01,530
I'm coming with you.

1390
01:52:39,610 --> 01:52:43,447
THE END
