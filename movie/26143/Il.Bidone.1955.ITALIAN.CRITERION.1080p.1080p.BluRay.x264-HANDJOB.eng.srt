3
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:22,290
THE SWINDLE

4
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,328
My dearest Baron!

5
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,707
It's 10:30.
I'm always waiting on you guys.

6
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,678
Where have you been?

7
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,930
We couldn't find Roberto this morning.

8
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,600
That guy's got a girl in every town.

9
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,902
How beautiful!

10
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,632
It's only ten kilometers away.
You could have been there by now.

11
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,825
Why do we always have
to act like buffoons?

12
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,917
It's like a Corot landscape.

13
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,795
Here. Go hang yourself.

14
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:05,472
Here's the map.
That mark there is the tree.

15
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,266
The treasure is buried
eight steps from the tree.

16
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,563
- Understood.
- What are you doing? Yellow shoes?

17
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,233
Who'll see them under the cassock?

18
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,152
Give me that cross.

19
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,155
There.

20
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,531
What are these numbers?

21
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,202
A meter and a half down. Understood?

22
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:31,164
The earth has been smoothed over
so you can't tell the difference.

23
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,916
You just have to dig.

24
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,919
I think we can easily do it
before evening.

25
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:43,343
Tell that idiot not to get smart
with the women. They're not stupid.

26
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:50,141
One more thing. Be careful.
There are two mean-looking dogs.

27
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,394
- Where's your ring?
- I've got it!

28
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,481
What's wrong with you this morning?

29
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:57,941
Nervous?

30
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,448
Let me have a look. Everything okay?

31
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,076
What's up with Augusto this morning?

32
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,828
The old fool is staggering. He's in agony.

33
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:14,207
Augusto? Beautiful spot, eh?

34
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,878
<i>Monsignore.</i>

35
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,969
All aboard! We're off.

36
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:12,181
Good morning, ma'am.

37
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:16,853
Excuse me,
would you mind calling the dogs, please?

38
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,690
Come here.

39
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,735
Does Stella Fiorina live here?

40
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,613
Is Stella Fiorina here?

41
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,537
What do you want? That's me.

42
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,039
<i>Monsignore,</i> that's her.

43
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,833
Good morning.

44
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,294
<i>Pax et bonum.</i>

45
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,713
It's a pleasure, Mrs. Stella Fiorina.

46
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,923
I believe you own this farm, right?

47
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:49,552
We have an extremely confidential matter
to discuss with you.

48
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,513
His Eminence has sent on his behalf,
specially from Rome,

49
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:56,225
his legal secretary Monsignor De Filippis.

50
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,943
<i>Monsignor?!</i>

51
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,292
We need to speak to you in private.

52
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,169
Is that possible?

53
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,305
Make yourself at home, Monsignore.
Please forgive the mess.

54
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,557
Get outside.

55
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,810
<i>Excuse us, Monsignore.</i>

56
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,312
- Get out!
- What a cutie!

57
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:50,488
- Here.
- Don Pietro, would you close the door?

58
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:16,139
A poor sinner at death's door

59
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:20,017
chose to disclose a dreadful secret to us.

60
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,438
It involves a murder.

61
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:27,024
During the war,
when the front passed through here,

62
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:31,571
this man fled with an accomplice
after committing a robbery.

63
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,824
He then killed his accomplice
and hid the body somewhere that,

64
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,910
according to his instructions,
is on your property.

65
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,913
Is there a tree somewhere on your land

66
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:44,125
standing all alone
in the middle of a field?

67
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,836
Yes, behind the vineyard.

68
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,172
That's it.

69
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,928
It's my duty to gather up those poor bones

70
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,931
and rebury them in consecrated ground.

71
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,478
It's a good deed
for which I need your help

72
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,397
for the sake of the murderer's soul.

73
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,861
- Is it far?
- No, just past the vineyard.

74
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,906
- What do you want to do?
- Tell me...

75
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,326
is it a secluded spot?

76
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,078
I mean, there's no risk of being seen?

77
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:25,625
I'd prefer not to wait for night,
since it won't take long.

78
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,170
You won't even have to do anything.

79
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,254
The treasure.

80
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,133
The treasure!

81
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:37,011
Oh, right! I almost forgot.

82
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:41,891
It seems that some jewelry the men stole
is buried with the bones.

83
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,436
The murderer may have meant
to return for it.

84
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:50,066
It's a little treasure trove.
Father has the complete list here.

85
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,109
But that's of no matter to us

86
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,238
since the deceased
expressly stated that, if found,

87
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,198
it should go to the landowner...

88
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,325
Meaning you.

89
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:04,247
Except for a small provision
to pay for a few masses for his soul.

90
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,838
You promise me you'll keep this secret?

91
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,006
It's in your own best interests,

92
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,969
because the state
might try to claim the treasure.

93
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,805
A treasure?

94
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,684
Yes, but our more pressing concern...

95
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,272
is burying those poor remains.

96
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,861
This is the tree.

97
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,405
Eight paces from this point
towards the vineyard.

98
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,782
<i>If I</i> may, <i>Monsignore,</i>

99
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,076
- It's here?
- I'd like to try counting them out.

100
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,328
Pardon me, <i>Monsignore.</i> One moment.

101
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,874
One, two, three, four,

102
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,794
five, six, seven, eight.

103
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:53,838
Eight...

104
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,716
<i>Monsignor?!</i>

105
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,845
It should be here, in this exact spot.

106
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:02,638
Good.

107
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,228
Well, shall we try?

108
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,230
Do you give your consent?

109
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,107
Yes.

110
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,570
- Please proceed.
- Whatever you say, <i>Monsignore.</i>

111
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,743
Watch out!

112
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,127
Come on. Come over here, ma'am.

113
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:52,688
I can't take any more.
<i>Monsignore,</i> there's nothing here.

114
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,524
- I need a rest.
- Give me that.

115
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,241
Be careful, Stella.

116
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,082
<i>Monsignore,</i> come here!

117
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,335
Augusto, here we go.

118
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,133
- Look!
- Good heavens! He was right!

119
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,679
PoorsouL

120
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,641
Look at that.

121
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,060
<i>Requiem aeternam...</i>

122
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,313
Easy, Roberto. Hand it here.

123
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,564
Thank you.

124
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,234
Thank you. Poor man.

125
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:43,990
Here we go. Such is man...

126
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,076
Blessed Lord...

127
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,869
Look at all these bones.

128
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,205
Blessed Virgin...

129
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,625
What's this bone?

130
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:57,086
There's something here!

131
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,007
<i>Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine...</i>

132
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:08,222
- Look, it's here!
- Monsignore, it's here!

133
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:19,775
One gold necklace
with diamonds and rubies.

134
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,531
One gold ingot weighing...

135
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,616
two kilos.

136
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,868
There we are.

137
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,080
Then one gold brooch...

138
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:36,333
- Is it all genuine?
- I wouldn't mind having it!

139
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,795
That is, I mean, if it weren't genuine,

140
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,340
it'd be all black by now, right?

141
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:47,720
I'm no expert, but I'd say
it's worth five or six million lire.

142
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:48,804
How much?

143
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,974
- May I have a glass of water?
- Six million!

144
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:56,228
Oh, yes. Six million, more or less.

145
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,731
Even more, with the way
gold has gone up recently.

146
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:02,568
- It has increased. Did you know, Father?
- That's true. Definitely more.

147
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,278
Probably seven million.

148
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,532
- Must we share it with you?
- Heavens, no.

149
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,243
Absolutely not. It's yours.

150
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,330
- All yours.
- Father.

151
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,293
"To whom it may concern:

152
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:24,215
Out of excruciating remorse
for my evil deeds,

153
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:28,969
and out of fear of burning
in eternal hellfire for my sins,

154
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,932
I provide that all the wealth
I wrongfully acquired

155
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,643
and buried next to the body of my victim,

156
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,354
given that the legitimate owners are dead,

157
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:42,358
should go to the owners of the land
on which it is found,

158
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,443
on one sole condition..."

159
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,696
I'm reading the last will and testament.

160
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,244
"on one sole condition:

161
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:57,706
that said owners have 500 masses said

162
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,084
for the salvation of my soul."

163
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,338
Do we have to pay for the masses?

164
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:07,675
Can our parish priest say them?

165
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,596
I'll have them said at St. Peter's.
Much better.

166
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,643
Five hundred masses at 1,000 lire each.

167
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,562
That's not much.

168
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,022
It's 500,000 lire!

169
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:28,863
"Should the owners
refuse the accursed gold,

170
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:33,534
I beg His Eminency to give it to charity."

171
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,416
Do we have to pay all at once?

172
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,377
Of course. That's what it says.

173
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,131
Remember:

174
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,343
This is a solemn secret.
There's a murder involved.

175
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,846
You ladies could even be implicated.

176
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,767
- We don't have that much all at once.
- We'll sell the oxen.

177
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,728
- Quiet!
- We'll manage!

178
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,564
<i>Monsignore,</i> we could take the ingot,

179
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,066
but of course, it's worth a lot more.

180
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,153
At least 1.5 million.

181
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,780
No, absolutely not.

182
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,449
We must find another way.

183
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:17,286
For now, we'll take everything
to His Eminence in Rome.

184
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,663
Don't worry. He'll find a solution.

185
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,249
- Shall we go?
- Certainly.

186
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,002
<i>Monsignore,</i> could you wait a moment?

187
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,670
I want to talk to my sister.

188
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,215
Listen, we have to do something...

189
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,318
Roberto, cut it out, please!

190
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,035
It's already 5:00 pm. We should go.

191
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,747
Look at him! Hello, cutie.

192
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,377
You look like a little devil!

193
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,421
The ladies, do you know where they are?

194
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,799
They took the cart
and went to the village.

195
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,222
Why have they gone to the village?

196
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:24,144
Deceitful <i>Monsignore,</i>
50 years old, ends up in jail!

197
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,525
He's the one who's most afraid.

198
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,159
Here they are.

199
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,541
There's a man, too.

200
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,221
We have 400,000.

201
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,640
425,000.

202
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:05,227
- We couldn't get any more.
- Will that do?

203
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:23,620
Thank you for everything!
May God reward you!

204
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,832
- Have a good trip!
<i>- Pax et bonum.</i>

205
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,168
Goodbye!

206
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:32,129
- Thank you!
- No, thank you!

207
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,320
Stop here. I'll get out. Thanks.

208
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,488
See you, Picasso.

209
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,324
See you tomorrow. Bye, Augusto.

210
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:18,884
Iris!

211
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,553
- Iris!
- Carlo!

212
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:25,182
Get Silvana dressed and come down.
We'll get dinner and see a movie.

213
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:28,268
- We started eating already.
- No, let's go out! Hurry!

214
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,478
Okay!

215
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,986
Hi, Daddy!

216
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,780
My darling!

217
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,907
Come here to Daddy.

218
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:55,671
Here's my little frog! Ah, my love!

219
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:59,133
- Why were you so late?
- Hold your daddy tight. Like that!

220
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,844
Yesterday, a lady in Viterbo asked me

221
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:05,055
if I knew a little girl named Silvana
who lives in Rome.

222
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:06,306
That's me! Me!

223
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,226
- Here you are! It's for you.
- A green handbag!

224
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,271
Yes, my love, my darling...

225
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,815
So many kisses for your daddy.

226
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:18,777
Go and call your mama now.
Tell her to come right away.

227
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,070
There we are.

228
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,077
Look what Daddy brought me!

229
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:30,164
He said a woman from Viterbo
gave it to him!

230
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,999
I don't believe him.

231
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,423
Hurry and get dressed now.
We're eating out.

232
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,844
- What was in the little bag?
- Sweets.

233
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:47,473
Sweets! Finish putting that on.

234
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,105
Let's go.

235
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,940
Carlo, here we come!

236
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:02,988
- At last!
- How are you, darling?

237
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,407
- Weren't you due back last night?
- Yes...

238
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,910
- What happened?
- I'll tell you later.

239
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,496
- Look.
- For me?

240
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,122
- Yes.
- How much did it cost?

241
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,750
- Do you like it?
- Oh, yes! A lot!

242
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,961
- What is it? I want to see!
- Come look.

243
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,005
- Wait, I'll put it here.
- Where shall we eat?

244
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,925
Wherever you want.
We'll decide on the way.

245
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,261
It's wonderful!
Look, what a lovely present! Let's go.

246
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,139
You could have sent me a telegram.
You know I worry.

247
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:32,142
- I can never locate you if I need you.
- Yes, but it's not my fault.

248
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:34,937
What can I do about it?
That's the life of a traveling salesman.

249
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,438
But we sold everything.

250
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:40,526
There was a nearby market,
and Augusto suggested we try there too.

251
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:45,280
So we did, and we sold our entire stock
of fabrics. Every single one.

252
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,368
In fact, look at this:
they even paid us in cash.

253
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,622
- Is all this ours?
- Of course. Who else's would it be?

254
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,042
- How much is it?
- 100,000.

255
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,878
We should give at least 20,000
to the trattoria.

256
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,505
No, 10,000 will do.

257
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:04,424
And then <i>—</i>
Was anyone looking for me at home today?

258
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,593
No. But how did you do it?

259
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:09,680
Like I said, we sold everything.
80, 10,000 to the trattoria,

260
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,057
10,000 to your mother
so she'll stop bothering us.

261
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,103
No, we're giving 20,000 to the trattoria
and we'll pay the baker and the others,

262
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:20,899
so I can finally breathe and step outside
without getting all those dirty looks!

263
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:24,111
Fine, as you like. In fact, you handle it.

264
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,572
You'll see, I'll make it last a month!

265
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:30,242
- Then you can paint in peace, you hear?
- Whose is this beautiful little face?

266
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:33,328
- You have to paint!
- Of course I do.

267
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,790
Listen, I saw some wonderful places
we should visit one day.

268
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:41,253
Not even the Dutch could dream up
such beautiful hilltop landscapes.

269
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,481
Wow, this guy's too much!

270
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:11,366
<i>What a gorgeous pansy you own
What a gorgeous pansy you have</i>

271
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,786
<i>Will you give it to me, your pansy?</i>

272
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,622
Hey, boys!

273
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,874
The big spenders are here!

274
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,669
Our evening's solved now!

275
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,598
- Here.
- Thanks!

276
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:35,891
Have a smoke.

277
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,687
Luigi, come here.

278
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,399
What's your best champagne?

279
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,110
We have Cordon Rouge and Perrier-Jouét.

280
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,655
For me... Perrier-Jouét!

281
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,494
And take some drinks
to that thirsty bunch.

282
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,621
Cheers!

283
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,289
Who did you guys rob?

284
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:00,582
Hi, Riccardo.

285
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,422
They ordered champagne.

286
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,843
Everything okay, Mr. Rocca?

287
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,640
Roberto!

288
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:02,811
Did you see the Cadillac outside?
She's loaded!

289
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,006
- Do you work here?
- Excuse me?

290
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,219
I asked... are you a dancer?

291
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,472
I'm an entertainer.

292
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,684
What are you, German?

293
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,227
No, English.

294
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:53,111
- Do you sing too?
- No, I only sing for myself.

295
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,071
What a beautiful girl you are.

296
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,791
- I have to go. This is my number.
- All right. Go ahead.

297
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:54,965
Okay.

298
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,598
The automobile!

299
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,019
That's nothing.

300
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,005
- You're gonna break my drums.
- Let me play.

301
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,222
Listen, Augusto. This is for you.

302
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:51,688
Luigi, look at these clowns
I have to work with.

303
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:54,983
Only fit for living off women.
They make me laugh!

304
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,068
That's young people today.

305
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,029
I was never like that!

306
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,114
I've always worked in style.

307
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,366
I've swindled my way around the world,

308
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,368
because the world is full of idiots.

309
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:08,496
I can sell ice to the Eskimos!

310
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,125
And I have to work with these amateurs.

311
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,503
I'm going back to working solo.

312
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,175
Shall we go?

313
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,012
Give me my violin
before you break it. Cut it out!

314
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,680
It cost 40,000 lire.

315
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,183
I'll give it back
only if you play the variations.

316
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,768
Okay, I'll play them. Give it to me.

317
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,144
- You'll play them?
- I will.

318
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,729
Go on.

319
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:50,163
He's a good-looking kid, Roberto.
Do you like him?

320
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:53,500
I prefer to stay with you.
Don't you want me to?

321
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,680
Miss, could you change 5,000 lire?

322
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:10,016
Word of honor: you're getting a bargain.

323
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,479
I'm a bit hard up at the moment.
You can have it for 15,000.

324
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,732
It's my wife's <i>—</i> a present from me.

325
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:22,862
Trust me, I wouldn't be selling it
if I weren't up to my neck in debt.

326
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,573
You know,
a guy can go through rough times...

327
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,409
- Hey, Augusto.
- Hello!

328
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,120
Good morning.

329
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,247
- What are you doing? You're selling it?
- Yes.

330
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,834
- For how much?
- 15,000. Imagine that.

331
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,669
Why? I'd have bought it!

332
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,462
- Ah, you'd have bought it?
- Of course.

333
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:42,048
Fine then. It's yours. Take it.

334
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:46,177
In fact,
if you're in this line of business,

335
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:51,641
I can get you three dozen
for 1,500 each, tax-free.

336
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,352
What do you mean?

337
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:58,690
I mean I buy them
for 500 lire each in Lugano.

338
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:03,611
I've been in this business long enough
for my hair to turn white.

339
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,572
I don't mean to boast.

340
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:09,075
- Can I buy you a drink?
- What a swell old guy! A Campari.

341
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:11,453
- You?
- Perhaps a Negroni.

342
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:15,498
A Campari, a Negroni,
and a lemonade. Sorry, eh?

343
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,168
- Give me the watch.
- You don't trust me?

344
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,254
Didn't you notice he was a crafty old fox?

345
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:23,923
The baron's here.

346
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,634
- Put it on the Milanese's tab.
- Send our drinks over.

347
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,929
It looks like everything's ready
for tomorrow morning.

348
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,932
Vargas had another great idea.
On the outskirts of Rome...

349
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,299
Hey, kids, out it out!

350
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,218
Beat it! Come on!

351
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,345
Come on, let's go.

352
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,515
Allow me, sir.

353
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:23,691
Good morning.

354
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,612
Hey there! What about you?

355
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:30,698
Up there all alone.

356
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,744
Who put you up there?
Are you in the mountains?

357
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:38,998
Come on, don't cry. I'll get you down.

358
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,251
Augusto, what's he doing?

359
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:44,963
- What's your name? Are you scared?
- Hey, what are you doing?

360
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,799
- This is my kid.
- He could have fallen off the roof.

361
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,177
Listen, perhaps you could tell me...

362
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:56,808
where I might find
Mr. Sigismondo Giacotti?

363
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,727
Is Sigismondo Giacotti here?

364
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,187
He went to the hospital.

365
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:10,280
Well, what about Giovanni Bartoli?

366
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,366
Giovanni Bartoli? Ask him.

367
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,118
What do you want with Giovanni Bartoli?

368
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:19,622
- It's about assigning public housing.
- That's me!

369
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,166
- They're assigning housing?
- Sure.

370
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,918
- I applied two years ago.
- Me too.

371
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,837
Is Bevilacqua on your list? Check it!

372
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,381
I applied too. No one ever showed up.

373
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:32,719
Calm down. The gentleman here
can explain everything. Follow me.

374
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,554
They're here for the new housing project!

375
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:38,308
- Bice, the public housing guys are here!
- What's going on?

376
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:42,145
Take it easy. No need for a racket.
Stand back.

377
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:44,606
One at a time. He'll explain everything.

378
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,400
Don't make such a racket.
Cut it out, kids.

379
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:50,486
I said out it out! Come on. One at a time.

380
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:54,365
Good morning. You finally showed up.

381
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,783
Did you explain everything?

382
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,745
Yes, I said we've come
to assign public housing.

383
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:01,080
I've been told the first family
lives over there.

384
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,583
- Very well.
- They're giving us a home!

385
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:09,797
- It's taken forever!
- I applied two years ago!

386
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,426
You've been sent by providence itself,
my name is Antonio Assone.

387
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:17,263
- I applied 14 months ago!
- Who's getting an apartment?

388
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:19,098
This burn?

389
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,853
What happened to my application?

390
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:26,231
I've been waiting forever.

391
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:41,663
I don't know a thing!

392
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,750
One moment! Calm down, please!

393
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,170
Quiet, please!

394
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:55,051
The first apartments
will be assigned in a month's time.

395
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,095
They've been saying that forever!

396
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:05,061
That's enough! Silence!

397
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:07,272
One at a time. Come on.

398
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:10,024
These are your contracts.

399
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,069
You just need to sign
and pay the first installment.

400
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,487
What?

401
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,032
How much is it?

402
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,827
That depends on the number of rooms.

403
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:25,456
It could be 9,000, 9,500, 10,000.
Depends on the number of rooms.

404
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,625
What if we ain't got it?

405
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,796
Don't worry if you don't have it.
You'll be in the second group.

406
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,715
It'll be your turn next time.

407
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,050
How much do I have to pay, Ada Colangeli?

408
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,594
Look up Ada Colangeli.

409
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:41,222
- I said two rooms.
- 9,000 lire.

410
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,433
What about Luigi Fiorelli?
I applied three years ago.

411
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,727
- And you?
- Maria Bove.

412
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,354
- And you?
- Calabro, Catena!

413
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,273
- Did you apply?
- Yes, five months ago.

414
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,400
I applied two years ago.

415
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:55,695
What are you talking about?
You had an apartment and you sold it!

416
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:58,281
- This guy deserves no pity.
- It wasn't my house!

417
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:01,951
- I didn't sell it!
- You tried to sell it to me!

418
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,370
That's rubbish! Shut up!

419
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:08,875
Let's go inside, sir.
You won't get anything done out here.

420
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:14,547
Stand back! There's no need for a racket!
Calm down!

421
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,216
One at a time! Calm down!

422
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,428
Forgive the mess.
Make yourself comfortable.

423
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:24,640
- I spoke to him first. Let me in.
- One at a time.

424
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:27,810
Calm down. Could you all calm down?

425
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,485
Can you check the list?
My name is Bevilacqua!

426
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,528
That little boy's mine.

427
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,156
That's right, Giorgio.
Say hello to the gentleman.

428
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,410
- Who's first?
- Ernestina Giacotti.

429
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:47,288
That's me, sir. God bless you.

430
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,166
- Gino Bevilacqua!
- Right here.

431
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,294
8,500.

432
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,713
- Aldo Nevi!
- Sign here.

433
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:58,633
Calabro, Catena!

434
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,886
10,500!

435
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,180
I've only got 4,000.

436
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,765
Let her through!

437
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,767
Celestina Mengozzi!

438
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,685
7,700 lire.

439
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:13,147
Sir, I've got the money. 9,000 lire.

440
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,817
- My name is De Felice, Giovanni.
- All right. Thank you.

441
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,361
Here, I've got 5,000 lire.

442
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:21,489
- Can you lend me 1,000 lire?
- To you of all people?

443
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:29,539
- Soap bubbles for your children!
- I'd like to find something.

444
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,458
- Don't you like these?
- Yes, but I don't feel like eating.

445
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:34,168
The most welcome of presents!

446
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,047
I have to give you 10,000 lire.

447
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:40,800
- Yeah, hand it over!
- I'll give it to you, I'm not <i>—</i>

448
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:43,136
Now, this I like! Look!

449
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,930
- Can I try it, please?
- For the kids. Just 200 lire.

450
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,223
Look at this!

451
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:50,977
- Why doesn't it work?
- You have to blow gently.

452
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:55,189
I get it. Blow gently...

453
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,525
You try, sir.

454
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,861
Augusto, watch this.

455
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:04,657
It's fun, isn't it, sir?
Buy it! It's only 200 lire.

456
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,911
No need to buy expensive toys.
Make your kids happy for just 200 lire.

457
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,455
Look at that beautiful bubble!

458
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,332
Nice, isn't it?

459
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,882
Don't you enjoy these things, Augusto?
Wrap it for me.

460
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,593
- Let's go!
- Just a minute while I pay.

461
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:27,722
I want to take it to Silvana.
You know her. I'm sure she'll love it.

462
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,141
You're the one who loves it. You're a kid.

463
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:33,895
Watch out!

464
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,940
- What's the big idea?
- Damn you!

465
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:41,569
If it isn't Mr. Jailbird!
You old cockroach.

466
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,030
You bastard!

467
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:48,075
Augusto, it's me! Don't you recognize me?
What are you doing?

468
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,119
Rinaldo!

469
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,331
- How are you?
- Fine. And you?

470
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,625
Out on bail? Where you going?

471
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,460
Piazza del Popolo, with my friend.

472
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:00,213
Get in and bring him along.
I'll take you there.

473
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,384
- You're so rude!
- What of it?

474
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,763
- Get in, he's driving us.
- Fancy running into you on New Year's Eve.

475
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,139
Good evening, ma'am.

476
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:35,373
Augu, who brought you
a loaf with a file this time?

477
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,333
Same baker who brought you one.

478
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:49,262
It's been two years since I last saw you.
What have you been up to all this time?

479
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,138
Same old life.

480
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,808
More importantly, what about you?

481
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,852
I see you travel like a king.

482
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:01,774
You tried to swindle me
out of 5,000 lire, last time I saw you.

483
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:04,610
And I did! Admit it!

484
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,113
No, you didn't.

485
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:10,408
I sure did. You can bet on it.

486
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,661
Now he says he can't remember,
to protect his reputation.

487
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,539
Luciana...

488
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,083
do you know who this is?

489
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,751
This man's a scourge.

490
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:24,338
He's left half of Italy in tears.
He's Monsignor Bidone.

491
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,549
- He's worse than a flood!
- It's a pleasure.

492
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:30,344
Augusto Rocca. It's a pleasure.

493
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:35,182
Augu, do you still carry
those skulls around?

494
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,604
You're such a crook!

495
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:43,232
Ma'am, do you know him well?
This gentleman?

496
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,359
Listen up.

497
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,988
Picasso, if this guy shakes your hand,
count your fingers.

498
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:51,949
You'll be missing at least a couple.
He'd cheat his own mother.

499
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:55,995
- As if you wouldn't!
- But tell me... this car...

500
00:40:57,913 --> 00:41:00,541
- Is it really yours?
- Who else's would it be, you fool?

501
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,754
It must have cost a fortune.
At least four, four and a half.

502
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,923
Five and a half, thank you very much.

503
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:11,218
But if you buy it in Switzerland,
you pay a bit less.

504
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,179
My wife and kids live there, you know.

505
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:16,349
I bought them a villa in Geneva.
Looking onto the lake.

506
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,351
You should see the weather.

507
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,394
The kids go to school there.

508
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,397
You can't beat the Swiss for education.

509
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,149
They're a great people.

510
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:28,152
People here haven't got a clue.
They're helpless.

511
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:31,697
- What are you doing at midnight?
- My friend here invited me over.

512
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:34,033
No, you gotta come to my place.

513
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:36,369
I'll expect you after 10:00 pm.

514
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,455
You better come!
I'm not letting you go now!

515
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:42,041
Thanks, but I promised my friend here.

516
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:44,335
No problem. Bring him along.

517
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:48,214
- His wife's expecting us too.
- Bring her, too.

518
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,715
Rinaldo Russi.

519
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,051
Bring your wife along.

520
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:55,596
I'll be expecting you at Via Archimede 38.
I live on the third floor.

521
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,682
Don't be late
or you'll miss the best part.

522
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,141
Okay, then.

523
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:07,983
I'm counting on it. If you're not there,
I'll come looking for you.

524
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,610
Let them out!

525
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:13,447
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

526
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,782
Thank you.

527
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,911
When you gonna lose that belly?

528
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:23,457
- Good evening, ma'am.
- See you later.

529
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:29,046
- Who's he?
- What do you mean? I told you about him.

530
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:56,741
- I feel awkward. I'm not going in.
- Don't be silly.

531
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:57,908
Come on!

532
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,577
Let's go. Come on.

533
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,022
Augusto, over here!

534
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:32,401
- Rinaldo! What a nice house you have.
- So you came?

535
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:36,614
- Picasso, come here.
- Iris, come on.

536
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:41,118
- Come with me.
- This is Picasso's wife.

537
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,621
- It's a pleasure. Enjoy yourselves.
- It's a pleasure.

538
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,498
Come with me.
Be quiet and don't laugh, okay?

539
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:48,083
- Can't you see enough like this?
- Can you see anything, sir?

540
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:51,253
- Frankly not, but with these tricks...
- Wait a second! What tricks?

541
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,839
- Some girls nowadays use trickery.
- Well, not me!

542
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:56,717
Hold on, now. The problem's solved.

543
00:43:56,801 --> 00:44:00,262
Miss, you're in luck. A friend of mine
has arrived, the sculptor Bidoni.

544
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:03,390
- We can trust him. He's an artist.
- Ah, good!

545
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,184
So you're supposed to be a sculptor?

546
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:08,979
Of course. He made a monument
to swindlers in Terni.

547
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,774
- That's right.
- Yeah, sure.

548
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:15,069
- Mari, you're being stupid!
- Why?

549
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:19,240
- It's just friendly advice.
- Miss, let's get something straight.

550
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,743
You say you want to participate
in a beauty contest? And you want to win?

551
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:25,830
You say you have nice breasts,
but your word isn't enough. Prove it!

552
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,123
So what should I do?

553
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,042
- Undress.
- All right.

554
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:32,062
- Ah, that's a good girl!
- What are you looking at?

555
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,922
- I wanted to check!
- Move over, let us have a look, too!

556
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,065
Evening, ma'am.

557
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,117
Stop it!

558
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,620
What's going on here? What are you up to?

559
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:09,206
- It's that stupid Marisa.
- What's she doing?

560
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:12,084
What do you care? Get lost!

561
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:20,259
Good evening. Excuse me, Iris!

562
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,722
Iris, come here a minute.

563
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,641
Come here. Allow me to introduce my wife.

564
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,144
This lady is our hostess.

565
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,645
Pleased to meet you.

566
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,482
- Shall we dance?
- Yes.

567
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:45,367
Robertino.

568
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,912
Hey, Picasso!

569
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:50,539
Who let you in?

570
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:52,124
Roberto, you're here too?

571
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:56,045
It must really be a party for the masses.
Evening, ma'am.

572
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:59,840
- We came with Augusto.
- The old man's here too?

573
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:03,052
- That's right. We came together.
- Good! Excuse me.

574
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,804
Does Augusto know the host?

575
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:11,644
They're old friends. He gave us a lift.
He invited us here. He was really kind.

576
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,730
He's a legend!
They say he made a fortune running...

577
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,774
Yes, I know <i>—</i>

578
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:20,903
- I mean, I didn't know that.
- Where's Augusto now?

579
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,155
Give me my dress!

580
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:26,659
- She'll do fine in a beauty contest!
- Cut it out!

581
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,035
That's enough, boys!

582
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,496
Marisa, go in there and get dressed.

583
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,039
Stop it!

584
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:36,877
That's enough now!
Marisa's getting dressed.

585
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,967
Here's where the action is! May I?

586
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:47,054
Augusto, you look wonderful!
You're stunning tonight.

587
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:49,890
Is the host really your friend?

588
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:51,475
What are you after?

589
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:54,561
What are you two cooking up?
Anything in it for me?

590
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,730
Don't forget me. I'm your friend, right?

591
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:05,280
Excuse me. Rinaldo, open up.

592
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:08,867
- No one's in there.
- Open up, you louse.

593
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:13,414
Open this door now or you'll be sorry.

594
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,667
- Open up!
- Stop it. We have company.

595
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,544
I don't give a damn!

596
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:19,795
Open up!

597
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:21,481
- What do you want? Cut it out!
- Where's that whore?

598
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:25,509
Aren't you ashamed to make such a scene?
You're just like your mother!

599
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:28,220
- What's going on?
- Just look at yourself!

600
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:31,140
The poor girl felt ill.
Someone had to help her.

601
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:34,268
- Come here. Give me a kiss.
- I'll give you a kiss, all right!

602
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,228
They're kidding around.

603
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:38,272
Let's all go get a drink.

604
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,899
She got scared, that's all.

605
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:45,112
Excuse me, but I heard
you're one of those rare people

606
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:48,866
who are able to appreciate
a truly good painting, so I took <i>—</i>

607
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,869
Hey, Picasso! Good evening! May I?

608
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:55,205
I'm a friend of Augusto's,
Roberto Giorgio.

609
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,041
And this man's friend, too.

610
00:47:57,124 --> 00:48:00,794
You give great parties.
I'm really enjoying myself.

611
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,714
You were saying?

612
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:08,552
Just that you seemed like someone
who really knows about painting, so I <i>—</i>

613
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:12,514
- Are you sure you've got the right guy?
- What?

614
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:16,643
A man of your taste must know that
a nice painting completes the decor.

615
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,937
- Let's see what you've got.
- Of course.

616
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:23,650
It's a De Pisis. A man like yourself
knows that at a glance, right?

617
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:25,486
Did you do it?

618
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:28,447
- It's beautiful, right?
- No, I've been painting for years, but <i>—</i>

619
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,491
It's ten to midnight!

620
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,326
Turn the TV back on.

621
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,998
I think he liked it.

622
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:42,002
Hey, introduce me to Rinaldo.
I'm a guy who can do anything.

623
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:45,214
You think he needs guys like you?

624
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:46,757
Don't make me laugh!

625
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,552
Some friend you are! You'll pay for this.

626
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,722
- Hey, give me something!
- Give me a whiskey.

627
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:56,892
Rinaldo! Tell him how much you got
that time for the fire damage.

628
00:48:56,975 --> 00:49:00,145
- I can't remember.
- Hold on, he'll tell you now.

629
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:02,815
You're getting on my nerves!
That's enough!

630
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:05,734
I can't remember. It was 15 or 16 million.

631
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:09,238
16 million? Tell this fool here.
He doesn't believe it.

632
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:12,032
Does the insurance just pay like that?

633
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:14,535
You really don't remember
how much you got?

634
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:17,538
- You need a secretary.
- Luci! Are you listening?

635
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:25,546
- Excuse me, do you have a match?
- No, I don't.

636
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,256
Leave me alone. I'm mad at you.

637
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:30,092
Let's make up. Don't get me angry.

638
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,428
I was serious.

639
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:37,182
You? With that face? My secretary?

640
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:38,725
They'd arrest me right away.

641
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,018
I'd never get out.

642
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:51,071
Nina, what are you doing with the glasses?

643
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:54,616
I had to wash some. We ran out.
I only have two hands!

644
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,286
Go have a look. She's hopeless. Please.

645
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,122
On your feet.

646
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:23,896
Rinaldo, listen. I've got to talk to you.

647
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:27,232
- Let's have breakfast tomorrow.
- Why?

648
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,110
Let's get together tomorrow.

649
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:31,612
I'll give you a light.

650
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,576
It's very important.

651
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:39,578
Listen.

652
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:45,334
- What is it? Tell me, I'm listening.
- You remember the Texas Club?

653
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:49,338
I can lease it for three years <i>—</i>
In my name, of course.

654
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:52,966
I'll guarantee you 30,000 lire a day.

655
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,726
Wouldn't 30,000 interest you?

656
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,561
Grab him!

657
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,151
Grab him!

658
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:15,447
It's midnight! Old trash must go!
Let's throw the baron out the window!

659
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,913
Stop kidding around.

660
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:25,374
Cut it out! You'll ruin my new suit.

661
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:28,877
- Then strip him!
- No! Don't touch my trousers!

662
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:31,964
Come on, sweetheart!

663
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:51,566
It's midnight! Happy New Year, everyone!

664
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:10,919
Here you go, Rinaldo!
I want to have a toast with you!

665
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:15,382
Let's drink to the new year!

666
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:20,012
- Happy New Year.
- Cheers.

667
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,855
You'll have your exhibition this year.

668
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:32,649
Yes, darling. Whatever you say.

669
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:15,984
You know what we'll do one of these days?
We'll leave. We'll go to Venice.

670
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:20,155
You have to see it.
You can't imagine what it's like.

671
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:22,908
Silvana will have such fun in a gondola.

672
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:26,411
Or maybe... would you prefer Taormina?

673
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:29,247
Taormina is marvelous, even in winter.

674
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:33,543
No, Venice is more poetic.
But I'd need an evening gown.

675
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:36,421
Of course you would. And you'll have one.

676
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:42,803
- Carlo, I don't look good like this.
- No. Why do you say that?

677
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:47,057
They're all in evening dresses. But I <i>—</i>
If I had known, I wouldn't have come.

678
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,934
You're still the prettiest.

679
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:52,354
If you weren't already my wife,
I'd be making a pass at you.

680
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:58,068
My head's spinning.
Maybe I've drunk too much.

681
00:53:58,151 --> 00:54:01,071
- But it's nice, champagne.
- Of course!

682
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:07,619
Ma'am, have you seen
a gold cigarette case by any chance?

683
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:09,454
No, I'm sorry.

684
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,068
What do you want?

685
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:42,320
What are you saying?

686
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:46,283
It's midnight. You haven't even kissed me.

687
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,326
Kiss me.

688
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:55,250
Don't slobber all over my ear, you idiot!

689
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:03,550
- Are you two staying much longer?
- Well, yes.

690
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:07,471
Have you seen? She's wearing
five million just on her head.

691
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,140
- Who is she?
- Some old hag. I don't know.

692
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,018
You're so ugly!

693
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:17,898
We'll open an investment company
in a small town in my name,

694
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:21,234
so if it goes bad, I take the fall.

695
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:26,990
- We'll put it in my name.
- What are you talking about?

696
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:29,659
The investment company.

697
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:33,580
Don't you get it?
I'm not interested in that stuff anymore.

698
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:37,626
Tell me, how old are you?

699
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:42,380
- Why?
- Tell me. I want to know.

700
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:43,882
Forty-eight.

701
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:49,513
And you're still running those scams?
You astonish me, you know.

702
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,097
It's pathetic.

703
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:55,268
- What's up?
- Come here a minute.

704
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:58,480
- What is it?
- Come here!

705
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:01,358
You're such a pain!

706
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:11,284
Seriously?

707
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:20,168
Here's our generous host now!

708
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:25,090
I was just coming to thank you
and to wish you a happy New Year.

709
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,591
Thank you.

710
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:30,053
Listen, a lady here
lost her cigarette case.

711
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:33,306
Really? Poor thing.
I'm sorry to hear that.

712
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:36,142
But it's understandable
in all this confusion.

713
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,395
It's a gold cigarette case.

714
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:40,355
I don't understand.

715
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:43,441
You don't understand?
You didn't happen to find it?

716
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:47,279
A guy sometimes picks something up
without thinking

717
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:50,073
and only finds it in his pocket
when he gets home.

718
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,577
I still don't understand.

719
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:56,663
This guy's a scream.

720
00:56:57,455 --> 00:57:00,208
- You know what I'd do if I were you?
- What?

721
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:02,627
I'd look for it and I'd find it.

722
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:04,170
What's going on?

723
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:07,716
Dear Contessa, I think there's a thief.

724
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:11,678
You see, the thing is,
I'd do that very gladly. However I <i>—</i>

725
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,393
Look, what do you want?
What are you getting at?

726
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:21,855
You can't put one over on me
that easily, my friend.

727
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:25,358
The lady wants a smoke.
80 offer her a cigarette.

728
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,277
Just what do you want?

729
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,113
Come on. Pretend it was a joke.

730
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,950
Do you understand?

731
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:37,454
Say it was a joke and everyone's happy.

732
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:41,875
You gonna say it? Yes or no?

733
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,376
Okay, it was a joke.

734
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:48,840
Were you worried? Tell the truth.
I was joking.

735
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:51,509
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

736
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:53,386
- Satisfied?
- Get out.

737
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,929
Happy New Year, everyone!

738
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:59,851
Augu, some friends you've got!

739
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,687
You hang around with them?

740
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:06,983
Luci, you'd better check your pockets.

741
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:17,369
Which way are you going?

742
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,082
So you think you're clever, huh?

743
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:30,298
Tough time to find a taxi.

744
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:32,842
Your mother should have
strangled you at birth.

745
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:35,428
I know, you're right.
But stop spitting in my face.

746
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,097
What are you doing?

747
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:41,309
I wouldn't advise it at your age.
It's unhealthy, you know. Be a good boy.

748
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:42,560
Taxi!

749
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,396
Go home to bed.

750
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,234
Happy New Year!

751
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,071
Do you want to come with us?

752
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,366
Come with us.

753
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,204
No. Good night.

754
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,807
Some joke, huh?

755
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:23,143
A cigarette case.

756
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:28,606
He must have been drunk. I'm sure of it.

757
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:32,610
Do you want a cigarette?

758
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:38,199
What are you doing with those people?
Why are you always with them?

759
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,743
What are you up to?

760
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:42,370
Nothing. We work.

761
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:46,624
What do you do with Roberto
and the other one? What sort of work?

762
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:48,460
What do you think?

763
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,171
You know I've always told you everything.

764
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:54,841
I never know anything!
You never tell me the truth!

765
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:05,018
I'm not like them, you know.

766
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:07,270
Do you think I want to be ruined?

767
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:10,982
I work. I don't do anything wrong.

768
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,402
I have to do something to keep you both.

769
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:19,532
You have to be a thief?
You'll end up in jail!

770
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:21,785
Iris, please...

771
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:29,751
Darling, it's New Year's.
Let's not start the year like this.

772
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:32,128
I saw right away what they were like.

773
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:36,341
I've asked you again and again,
but all I get from you is lies.

774
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:40,053
You leave, you come home.
I never know where your money's from.

775
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,680
It's always trouble.

776
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:47,435
Every time the doorbell rings,
my heart freezes.

777
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:50,522
I can't take it anymore.

778
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:54,150
I can't take it anymore.

779
01:00:55,944 --> 01:00:59,239
Iris, please, don't act like this.

780
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,407
I beg you, calm down.

781
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:07,330
I love you, Iris.

782
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:10,792
I'll do anything you want. I swear.

783
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:19,008
I'll have nothing more to do with them.
They'll never see me again.

784
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:23,221
I'll find some way to make money.

785
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:25,723
I'll sell my paintings.

786
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,433
I don't believe you anymore.

787
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,310
You're right. I know.

788
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,648
But I swear I'll turn over a new leaf.

789
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:36,985
I swear. Believe me, darling!

790
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:39,946
That's what you always say.

791
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:45,743
It's true, but you and Silvana
are all I've got.

792
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:47,662
You two are all I think about.

793
01:01:54,919 --> 01:02:00,174
You know I don't mind
having no money. I'm not scared.

794
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:04,762
I just want you to be the same as you were
when we got married.

795
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:10,768
Now you kiss my hand!

796
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:13,605
- Do you want a cigarette now?
- Yes.

797
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:18,568
You'll see what I'll do to you
one of these days.

798
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,571
You just laugh.

799
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:24,866
Anyway, happy New Year.

800
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,414
Darling, let's go and see
what's happening over there.

801
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:32,498
Come on.

802
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:46,846
Hey, happy New Year! Where are you going?

803
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:49,557
Wait a minute. Come with us.

804
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:53,227
There's no better way
to start the new year!

805
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:56,856
We'll bring you luck. Come on.

806
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:58,816
See you.

807
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:49,951
Hey, fatty!

808
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:51,577
Augusto!

809
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:57,625
Augusto! Over here.

810
01:03:57,709 --> 01:03:58,793
Come here.

811
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,296
Look at this beauty.

812
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:06,134
- Whose is it?
- Get in!

813
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:08,469
Wouldn't you like to know?

814
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:12,974
<i>But my secret is hidden within me...</i>

815
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,145
There he is!

816
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:29,157
Beautiful car! Are we going in this?

817
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:32,160
Where are the coats? Let me try one on.

818
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:36,497
Be careful with it.
They're sort of flimsy.

819
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:38,666
They cost 1,600 lire each.

820
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:40,418
They look good.

821
01:04:40,501 --> 01:04:45,006
Still, at 1,600 each,
I think you got swindled, you know.

822
01:04:45,506 --> 01:04:46,591
No, that's not expensive.

823
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:50,720
Is that right? Next time, you go.
Artists are such great negotiators.

824
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:53,473
My own mother sewed on the buttons.
And even those were expensive.

825
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:54,682
Keep your arms straight.

826
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:57,226
Hands out of your pockets.
Don't wake the moths.

827
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:58,936
- Smell.
- Smells like rats.

828
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:02,231
Get in the middle.
Augusto, go buy some cigarettes, please.

829
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:05,651
What's this cost to rent per day?

830
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:07,862
Nothing. It's my mother's.

831
01:05:07,945 --> 01:05:10,198
She's drugged.
She'll be out for three days.

832
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,325
Augusto, the cigarettes! Hurry.

833
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:21,626
But I told him, "Professor,
this isn't part of the course!"

834
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:23,377
- He couldn't reply.
- Dad!

835
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:27,840
Patrizia!

836
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:34,347
You've changed.
I wouldn't have recognized you.

837
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,390
- Patrizia!
- What are you doing over there?

838
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:37,767
I'm coming!

839
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:44,524
- No school today?
- Math was canceled, so we left early.

840
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,735
- You girls are going for a stroll?
- Yes.

841
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:52,240
- How's your mother?
- She's fine.

842
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:54,283
She had the flu, but she's better.

843
01:05:58,246 --> 01:05:59,872
You've really changed.

844
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:02,750
You're a young woman now.

845
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:06,671
You haven't seen me
since Christmas last year.

846
01:06:09,549 --> 01:06:11,425
Just a minute! I'm coming!

847
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,178
Go on. They're waiting.

848
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:17,265
I'll come see you one of these days.

849
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:20,351
- Or I'll call.
- Sure.

850
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:22,687
I mean it. I promise.

851
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:24,647
All right.

852
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:29,777
- Bye, Patrizia!
- Bye, Dad.

853
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:07,773
Good morning, gentlemen.

854
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:11,736
- Two gallons.
- Super?

855
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:13,112
Your best!

856
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,168
Nice gig you got here.

857
01:07:27,919 --> 01:07:31,255
You do nothing from dawn to dusk
and rake it in.

858
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:33,299
- Right?
- Yeah, right.

859
01:07:33,925 --> 01:07:37,011
In fact, I own all the land around here.

860
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:39,513
If you only knew...

861
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:45,186
Damn it! The truth is that when a man
has worked his whole life,

862
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:48,231
he should have the right to rest!

863
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:49,649
What hours do you work?

864
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:51,484
There's no schedule here.

865
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:54,862
If I want to eat every day,
I have to work nights too.

866
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:56,697
You're kidding!

867
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:58,199
Oil? Water?

868
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:01,619
- Just check the tires.
- Right away.

869
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:07,208
- How much is it?
- 1,380 lire.

870
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:11,295
Fine. But I can't pay right now.

871
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:14,507
You know what? We're broke,

872
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:17,176
and I have to be at the prefecture
in Terni by 12:30.

873
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,553
Here's what we'll do.

874
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:24,558
I owe you 1,380. You give me 10,000 lire.

875
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:27,186
On my way back later,
I'll give you 13,000, okay?

876
01:08:27,853 --> 01:08:30,147
Well? What do you say?

877
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:34,151
What do you mean?

878
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:35,611
What's that?

879
01:08:35,695 --> 01:08:38,114
I just asked what you meant.

880
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:40,741
You don't trust me? Just say so!

881
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:44,203
I do trust you. I just don't understand.

882
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:45,746
Fine. I'll leave you my coat.

883
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:48,416
Hear that? He wants my coat!

884
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:51,585
I trust you, but I have to cover <i>—</i>

885
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:55,006
Let's give him a coat.
Will this do as a deposit?

886
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:56,382
- Yes.
- Roberto!

887
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:01,762
You're leaving him a coat worth at least
50,000 lire for a 10,000 lire loan?

888
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:04,724
What can I do? He doesn't trust me.

889
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:08,561
You're hoping I never come back.
Keep those greasy hands off!

890
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:11,063
Here you go. Ah, wait a minute.

891
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:13,566
My watch is in the pocket.
That would be too much.

892
01:09:14,608 --> 01:09:16,110
That would have been some bargain!

893
01:09:16,193 --> 01:09:18,279
I trust you because you're a gentleman.

894
01:09:18,362 --> 01:09:20,072
You trust me because I'm leaving you this.

895
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,074
- Show me where you'll put it.
- Follow me.

896
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,914
He's a friend, the old chap!

897
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,847
- Morning.
- Good morning.

898
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:47,600
- Gas?
- Two gallons of super.

899
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,436
- Is the tank in the back?
- Yes.

900
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:22,843
Be careful! What a fool!

901
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:28,265
- Look, let's try our strength!
- Test your muscles!

902
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:31,310
- Shall we have a go?
- Of course!

903
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:33,687
Augusto, do you remember this song?

904
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:35,731
Test your muscles!

905
01:10:53,874 --> 01:10:56,585
Let's go see the medieval citadel!

906
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:59,004
Shut up, you idiot.

907
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:02,883
Do you hear the racket that fool makes?

908
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:04,051
Quiet...

909
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:07,179
It's a stable.

910
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,724
Are there really no women in this town?

911
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:12,268
I haven't seen even one.

912
01:11:12,893 --> 01:11:14,395
Hey, ladies!

913
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:17,731
Imagine living here. I'd shoot myself!

914
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:21,068
Ladies and gentlemen, pure English wool!

915
01:11:21,152 --> 01:11:24,113
Guaranteed pure wool!

916
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:28,492
A sturdy material that never creases!

917
01:11:28,576 --> 01:11:32,997
Watch out, it's a bullfight!
Get ready for the bull!

918
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:37,710
Watch out, you'll break your neck!

919
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:42,798
What a fool.

920
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:19,752
We've got to figure out
something more serious.

921
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:21,587
We can't go on like this.

922
01:12:22,213 --> 01:12:26,050
Who's saying we should? I'm not an idiot.

923
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:29,803
This is just to keep us going,
just for fun.

924
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:31,055
I'm going to sing.

925
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:34,391
When I save up some money,
I'll take lessons. Seriously.

926
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:37,311
I already bought
all of Johnnie Ray's records.

927
01:12:37,394 --> 01:12:39,313
That's really my style.

928
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:41,690
You'll never take lessons.

929
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:43,901
I don't want to end up like you.

930
01:12:43,984 --> 01:12:46,028
I've got your example, old boy.

931
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:47,696
I've got your example.

932
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:50,783
<i>Old man, I've got your example</i>

933
01:12:53,285 --> 01:12:55,538
What an animal! Come and have a look.

934
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:58,207
Picasso! Cut it out!

935
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:06,257
I'll pay for everyone. How much is it?

936
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:08,008
- Come on.
- No, I want to take a ride!

937
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:10,844
- Come on!
- Leave me alone! Where are you taking me?

938
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:14,932
- Cut it out. Just look at yourself.
- I'm fine!

939
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:19,395
Augusto, how much is a ride?

940
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:23,148
Roberto, how much is...

941
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:27,653
See what happens when you let him drink!

942
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:29,238
I feel sick.

943
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:33,117
I let him drink? The wimp had two glasses!

944
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,244
Two glasses? More like a bottle.

945
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:38,581
- Just leave him there.
- Leave me here.

946
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:42,167
You know he gets drunk
just smelling the wine!

947
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:45,129
- What do you want?
- It's all just a joke to you, right?

948
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:46,922
Come wash your face.

949
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:49,633
Go on.

950
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:53,262
That's right, knock him out!

951
01:13:53,345 --> 01:13:54,555
It's hot!

952
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:57,433
Leave me alone!

953
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:08,360
Leave me alone, both of you.

954
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:11,697
- Hey, you!
- Where are you off to now?

955
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:14,700
- To ask this guy something.
- Wait for us.

956
01:14:18,662 --> 01:14:23,125
You go away too, Augusto. Go away.

957
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:29,882
How do you feel?

958
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:34,595
I feel bad.

959
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:40,059
You guys do whatever you want.

960
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:43,771
I'm going home.

961
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:48,233
Go on to Florence. Don't worry about me.

962
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:50,444
I want to go home.

963
01:14:50,527 --> 01:14:52,863
There must be a train
going through here, right?

964
01:14:52,946 --> 01:14:56,367
Where are you going?
You can hardly stand up.

965
01:14:58,786 --> 01:15:01,163
Come here, take this thing off.

966
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:05,668
Walk a bit. You'll feel better.

967
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:19,640
One of these days,
I won't have a home anymore.

968
01:15:20,432 --> 01:15:22,559
I can't keep going around with you two.

969
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,437
Iris suspects something.

970
01:15:26,563 --> 01:15:28,607
She's asking lots of questions.

971
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:33,696
I can't keep telling her all these lies.

972
01:15:36,448 --> 01:15:38,200
One of these days,

973
01:15:38,283 --> 01:15:41,995
she'll take the child
and go home to her mother.

974
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:43,872
You'll see! She'll do it!

975
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:47,292
And if she takes my little girl...

976
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:52,047
I'll kill myself!

977
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:59,388
You were stupid to get married at 18.

978
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:03,183
You can't do anything anymore.
You're finished!

979
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:08,814
Trust me. Find some other line of work
while there's still time.

980
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,233
Find something better.

981
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:18,657
Why?

982
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:23,579
But I've got the right face, don't I?

983
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:25,247
Look.

984
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:30,294
You've always said
that I could cheat anyone with this face.

985
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:33,839
I look like an angel.

986
01:16:36,467 --> 01:16:41,263
You can leave me anywhere in the world,
even where I don't know anyone,

987
01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:43,932
and I'll always land on my feet.

988
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:46,643
Say, "A million."

989
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:53,984
Come on, you heard me. Say, "A million."

990
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:58,071
A million.

991
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:02,367
See? You can't even say it!
Do you know why?

992
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:04,995
Because you can't even imagine
having millions of lire!

993
01:17:05,078 --> 01:17:08,290
Whatever you earn, you run home
and give to your wife, you wretch!

994
01:17:08,373 --> 01:17:10,834
But, Augusto, I...

995
01:17:10,918 --> 01:17:13,587
In this business, you can't have a family.

996
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:17,132
You have to be free to come and go
whenever you want,

997
01:17:17,216 --> 01:17:19,927
not tied to your wife's apron strings!

998
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:21,345
You have to be alone.

999
01:17:22,596 --> 01:17:26,099
The most important thing
when you're young is to be free.

1000
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:28,685
It's more important
than the air you breathe.

1001
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:32,105
If you're scared now...

1002
01:17:33,565 --> 01:17:36,860
imagine when you're my age.

1003
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:41,156
The years roll on by, you know...

1004
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:45,994
Come on. Get up now.

1005
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,706
Come on. Let's go.

1006
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:56,421
Walking will do you good.

1007
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:03,387
- Are you feeling better now?
- Yeah.

1008
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:06,765
But I'm not going to Florence, you know.
I'm going home.

1009
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:10,519
No, come on. We'll have fun in Florence.
We have tons of dough.

1010
01:18:10,602 --> 01:18:12,855
No, I'm going home.

1011
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:17,067
Augusto, how do you do it?

1012
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:21,196
I admire you. I wish I had your courage.

1013
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:25,951
But how can you go on
doing this at your age?

1014
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:29,079
Aren't you ever afraid?

1015
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:34,835
Afraid of what?

1016
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:42,050
No, I'm not like you.

1017
01:18:46,263 --> 01:18:47,931
It's starting to rain!

1018
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:53,353
Here's Miss Frosinone!

1019
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:55,314
Look at Roberto!

1020
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:58,233
See what a good friend I am?

1021
01:18:58,317 --> 01:19:00,027
Hold on. Come on.

1022
01:19:03,947 --> 01:19:07,159
- Where are you going?
- Come on!

1023
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:10,746
Picasso, what are you doing? Hurry up!
Come up here!

1024
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:12,289
Just look at this girl!

1025
01:19:17,961 --> 01:19:19,838
Luigina, a local gentlewoman.

1026
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:22,122
- Augusto, our spiritual grandfather.
- It's a pleasure.

1027
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:25,052
The lady would like to go
for a romantic drive.

1028
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:28,013
- Hands off! Everyone knows me in town.
- My apologies, ma'am.

1029
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:31,058
What do you want? Ah, hold on.

1030
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:33,060
- Here. Take this.
- I was asleep.

1031
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:37,272
We haven't got long.
My husband gets home at midnight.

1032
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:38,649
Let's go! It's raining!

1033
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:41,818
- What's your husband do?
- He works. Nice car!

1034
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:43,070
Let's go.

1035
01:19:44,696 --> 01:19:46,365
Thank you, Amilcare.

1036
01:19:48,575 --> 01:19:52,621
Where do you think you're going?
What are you up to?

1037
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:59,920
Picasso, go get some sleep.
We'll see you in the morning.

1038
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:09,429
We're like sardines in here!

1039
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:12,432
There's a radio too? Turn it on.

1040
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,164
Home...

1041
01:20:37,457 --> 01:20:38,792
Yes, I'm going home.

1042
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:41,712
I'm going home.

1043
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:12,701
Have you been waiting long?

1044
01:21:13,827 --> 01:21:16,079
No, you're right on time.

1045
01:21:16,621 --> 01:21:18,123
Let me look at you.

1046
01:21:19,916 --> 01:21:21,293
Very stylish!

1047
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:26,089
- Hold on.
- Thanks, but you don't need to.

1048
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:35,140
It's a beautiful day. I have an idea.
Shall we eat in Monte Mario?

1049
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:36,308
Let's go.

1050
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:38,852
Or if you prefer here in town?

1051
01:21:38,935 --> 01:21:41,605
It's the same for me,
as long as I'm home by 7:00 pm.

1052
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:43,190
Monte Mario it is!

1053
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:46,943
I've put on weight, huh?

1054
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:48,612
No, you look great.

1055
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:51,990
Do you know how old I am? 48.

1056
01:21:52,699 --> 01:21:54,159
That's not so old.

1057
01:21:58,163 --> 01:22:00,290
What will you do when you graduate?

1058
01:22:00,373 --> 01:22:02,084
- I've got to decide.
- Decide what?

1059
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:04,169
Whether to stop or go on.

1060
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:07,672
It would be four more years.
That's a long time.

1061
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:11,802
What's wrong, don't you like studying?

1062
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:13,929
Yes, I do. I'd like to continue.

1063
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:17,390
Mama would like me to as well,
but I can't keep being a burden on her.

1064
01:22:25,148 --> 01:22:27,067
And what would you do after that?

1065
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:28,944
- I'd teach.
- What?

1066
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:31,154
- I'd teach.
- You want to teach?

1067
01:22:31,238 --> 01:22:36,118
Of course. Actually, I plan to find
a part-time job to pay for school.

1068
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:37,619
Many of my friends do that.

1069
01:22:37,702 --> 01:22:40,205
A girlfriend of mine
makes good money as a cashier.

1070
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:41,790
What does a cashier earn?

1071
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:44,209
Well, 30,000 or 35,000.

1072
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:46,044
- How much?
- 35,000.

1073
01:22:46,128 --> 01:22:51,424
35,000 lire?
No one can live on 35,000 a month!

1074
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:53,593
That's what it pays,

1075
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:56,012
and lots of people live on that.

1076
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:58,181
Your dessert and cognac.

1077
01:23:00,183 --> 01:23:03,812
Young people today
have to work for a living.

1078
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:08,942
In any case, cashier jobs require
a security deposit of 200,000 or 300,000.

1079
01:23:09,025 --> 01:23:10,318
I certainly don't have it.

1080
01:23:14,364 --> 01:23:15,532
How pretty!

1081
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:18,702
It's really pretty.

1082
01:23:18,785 --> 01:23:20,829
- You like it?
- It's beautiful.

1083
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:24,207
- Keep it, it's yours.
- It's too nice for me.

1084
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:26,459
Don't be silly. It's nothing.

1085
01:23:27,294 --> 01:23:29,963
Just be careful winding it up.

1086
01:23:31,214 --> 01:23:32,424
It's very fragile.

1087
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:36,720
Thank you, Dad. It's really nice.

1088
01:23:36,803 --> 01:23:38,763
Waiter? The bill, please.

1089
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:44,186
Right there.

1090
01:23:44,811 --> 01:23:47,314
- It's a bit far back.
- It's better here.

1091
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:04,789
She thought we were sweethearts.

1092
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,503
- Can you see all right?
- Yes.

1093
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:16,718
If you want to continue your studies,
I'll get you that deposit money.

1094
01:24:17,427 --> 01:24:20,931
200,000 or 300,000 lire is nothing to me.
I can get that anytime.

1095
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:34,819
Ice cream!

1096
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:36,543
- Do you want an ice cream?
- Yes, please.

1097
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:38,406
- Two ice creams.
- Here they come.

1098
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:41,868
- Keep Sunday open for me.
- All right.

1099
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:45,622
Thanks.

1100
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:48,583
- Ice cream man!
- Here I come.

1101
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:56,383
Ice cream! Sweets! Ice cream!

1102
01:25:02,889 --> 01:25:05,392
What's wrong? Don't you feel well?

1103
01:25:05,475 --> 01:25:06,810
It's nothing.

1104
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:29,207
I'm going to get some cigarettes.

1105
01:25:45,765 --> 01:25:46,975
How are you?

1106
01:25:47,642 --> 01:25:49,769
I've been looking for you for six months.

1107
01:25:50,437 --> 01:25:55,442
- Couldn't we discuss this tomorrow?
- Tomorrow? No. We'll discuss it now.

1108
01:25:55,525 --> 01:25:56,943
Please.

1109
01:25:57,027 --> 01:26:01,114
Filthy scum!
You'll hear me out now, you crook!

1110
01:26:01,197 --> 01:26:03,992
- Take it outside!
- Miss, can't you sit down?

1111
01:26:05,368 --> 01:26:08,580
- Look who it is.
- There he is. Well done!

1112
01:26:10,457 --> 01:26:13,168
- Take it outside!
- Cut it out!

1113
01:26:13,626 --> 01:26:15,337
Please, let's go outside!

1114
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:23,595
Why the police station? What have I done?

1115
01:26:23,678 --> 01:26:25,347
This bastard still wants to know why!

1116
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:28,892
Keep your cool.
Settle this at the police station.

1117
01:26:28,975 --> 01:26:32,395
- I'm going to break his bones!
- Ah, there! Officer, excuse me!

1118
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:34,856
- What's going on?
- Please, let me go now.

1119
01:26:36,274 --> 01:26:40,278
- What's going on here?
- This murderer sold me fake antibiotics.

1120
01:26:40,362 --> 01:26:42,864
- My brother nearly died!
- Thief!

1121
01:26:42,947 --> 01:26:45,617
- Cut it out!
- Calm down!

1122
01:26:46,534 --> 01:26:48,703
- Stop it now.
- Me? A thief?

1123
01:26:48,787 --> 01:26:51,039
- That's enough, I said!
- Dad?

1124
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:52,874
What did he do?

1125
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:57,295
Cut it out! Let's go
to the police station. Come on.

1126
01:26:58,421 --> 01:27:01,383
- They're arresting a guy!
- They're taking him away.

1127
01:27:02,092 --> 01:27:03,718
- Let's go!
- Go home.

1128
01:27:03,802 --> 01:27:07,806
You can explain at the station.
Come on now.

1129
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:09,307
Go home!

1130
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:22,195
Officer!

1131
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:27,075
- Stay back!
- We just want to see!

1132
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:11,703
Well, what will you do now?

1133
01:28:11,786 --> 01:28:13,246
No idea.

1134
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:16,708
- Have you got a cigarette?
- Sure.

1135
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:20,462
Just don't screw up and end up back here.

1136
01:28:26,926 --> 01:28:29,220
- Thanks. Bye.
- Bye. And good luck.

1137
01:28:43,443 --> 01:28:45,361
They can take my mother!

1138
01:28:49,073 --> 01:28:50,909
No, I won't be in Rome this week.

1139
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,328
The lawyer?

1140
01:28:54,579 --> 01:28:56,164
They arrested him?

1141
01:28:57,248 --> 01:29:00,752
How should I know?
Forged signatures or something.

1142
01:29:02,212 --> 01:29:03,213
Okay.

1143
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:05,173
Okay.

1144
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:07,091
Hello.

1145
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:09,677
Look who's back!
What can we serve you? A cognac?

1146
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:11,304
No, a Negroni.

1147
01:29:11,387 --> 01:29:13,640
Where have you been all this time?
Out of town?

1148
01:29:17,644 --> 01:29:19,395
Has Roberto been around this morning?

1149
01:29:19,479 --> 01:29:22,774
The blond guy who was always laughing?
He hasn't been around in a while.

1150
01:29:26,069 --> 01:29:28,655
- Roberto Giorgio?
- Yeah.

1151
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:31,658
- He's in Milan.
- Since when?

1152
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:36,579
- Must be three months now.
- What's he doing there?

1153
01:29:36,663 --> 01:29:40,458
He's done well for himself.
I saw him driving an Aurelia sports car.

1154
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:42,293
Yeah, an Aurelia sports car.

1155
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:45,171
Have you seen Baron Vargas?

1156
01:29:45,255 --> 01:29:47,257
Yesterday, but not today.

1157
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:50,426
- But he still comes around?
- Not too often.

1158
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:52,595
Please pay at the register.

1159
01:30:47,066 --> 01:30:48,693
Hello!

1160
01:30:48,776 --> 01:30:51,112
- Are you Paolo Gazzese?
- Yes.

1161
01:30:51,195 --> 01:30:52,780
<i>Monsignore,</i> it's him.

1162
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:56,326
We have a very important matter
to discuss with you.

1163
01:30:58,494 --> 01:31:02,123
- I found a bone!
<i>- Monsignore,</i> a bone!

1164
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:06,502
And there's even a skull! Look!

1165
01:31:29,233 --> 01:31:32,236
It weighs a ton! Give me a hand!

1166
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:35,448
- I could do with a nice cup of coffee.
- Me too.

1167
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:44,457
Susanna, what are you doing here?
Go into the other room.

1168
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:47,502
My apologies, <i>Monsignore.</i>

1169
01:31:48,294 --> 01:31:49,796
This is my daughter.

1170
01:31:49,879 --> 01:31:52,715
- Renata, take her next door.
- Come on, Susanna.

1171
01:31:58,554 --> 01:32:03,309
It's my younger daughter, poor thing.
God made her like that.

1172
01:32:08,564 --> 01:32:10,650
- Come on, Riccardo.
- Excuse me.

1173
01:32:12,402 --> 01:32:15,071
Here's a list of the treasure.

1174
01:32:15,697 --> 01:32:17,281
I'll need something to <i>—</i>

1175
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:18,991
Wait, I got it!

1176
01:32:21,911 --> 01:32:23,621
It's the friggin' Bank of Italy!

1177
01:32:24,288 --> 01:32:26,708
<i>Look! Monsignore.</i>

1178
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:30,420
- This must be 30 carats or more.
- As I said...

1179
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:34,215
- Right, reverend?
- The treasure is all yours.

1180
01:32:34,298 --> 01:32:35,383
I'm not an expert.

1181
01:32:35,466 --> 01:32:39,053
- The deceased left specific instructions.
- Do you want a cigarette?

1182
01:32:39,721 --> 01:32:42,807
The most important thing
to remember is this.

1183
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:43,891
It's all yours!

1184
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:45,643
You must not mention this to anyone.

1185
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:49,021
Monsignore?
Please, don't trouble yourself.

1186
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:51,315
There's one small problem.

1187
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:55,236
This gentleman doesn't have the full sum
for all the masses.

1188
01:32:55,319 --> 01:32:57,280
He has only... How much?

1189
01:32:57,363 --> 01:33:01,033
- 350,000 lire.
- What do we do?

1190
01:33:01,117 --> 01:33:04,287
That doesn't matter. We're not merchants.

1191
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:07,749
He can give what he has now
and the rest later.

1192
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:10,626
You can come back for it, Father.
I'll explain to His Eminence.

1193
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:15,840
I had set the money aside
to go to the fair tomorrow

1194
01:33:15,923 --> 01:33:19,343
and buy an animal to help me in my work.

1195
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:22,430
I have to put something aside,

1196
01:33:22,513 --> 01:33:25,349
not for myself, but for my two girls.

1197
01:33:25,433 --> 01:33:28,436
One works as hard as a man,

1198
01:33:28,519 --> 01:33:31,522
but the other is crippled, poor thing.

1199
01:33:32,064 --> 01:33:35,318
Who's gonna look after them when I'm gone?

1200
01:33:35,401 --> 01:33:38,613
Come on. You mustn't talk like that.

1201
01:33:38,696 --> 01:33:40,448
God abandons no one.

1202
01:33:40,531 --> 01:33:44,577
Look what providence sent your way.
Right, <i>Monsignore?</i>

1203
01:33:44,660 --> 01:33:48,956
You bet!
I wish I had this peasant's rotten luck!

1204
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,751
The Lord doesn't forsake His children.

1205
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:56,339
- Do you have the money on you?
- Yes, right here.

1206
01:33:56,422 --> 01:33:58,299
If you wouldn't mind...

1207
01:34:08,559 --> 01:34:12,313
It's getting late.
His Eminence expects us at 5:00 pm.

1208
01:34:12,396 --> 01:34:14,190
It's true. We have to go.

1209
01:34:14,273 --> 01:34:17,944
Forgive us, thank you and congratulations.

1210
01:34:24,575 --> 01:34:27,870
<i>Excuse me, Monsignore!</i>

1211
01:34:29,288 --> 01:34:32,959
Would you kindly speak to my daughter?

1212
01:34:33,042 --> 01:34:36,963
- I really can't.
- Please! Just a word or two.

1213
01:34:37,046 --> 01:34:38,881
Wait for me.

1214
01:34:38,965 --> 01:34:41,968
Thank you so much!

1215
01:34:42,051 --> 01:34:44,053
But don't tell her I asked you to.

1216
01:34:47,056 --> 01:34:49,141
Look, <i>Monsignore</i> wants to say hello.

1217
01:34:49,225 --> 01:34:51,310
I'll bring a chair.

1218
01:34:51,394 --> 01:34:53,604
No, I won't be long. No, stay there!

1219
01:35:06,450 --> 01:35:07,869
What's your name?

1220
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:09,287
Susanna.

1221
01:35:31,267 --> 01:35:33,811
You must have faith in God, my child.

1222
01:35:34,854 --> 01:35:38,733
I know it must be a terrible thing
for you, but we must accept His will.

1223
01:35:39,358 --> 01:35:43,988
This is a valley of tears,
and everyone has their cross to bear.

1224
01:35:44,906 --> 01:35:48,117
I know that. I'm not complaining.

1225
01:35:49,869 --> 01:35:51,412
It's them.

1226
01:35:53,915 --> 01:35:55,291
What do you mean?

1227
01:35:55,374 --> 01:36:00,379
If I weren't a burden on my family,
I wouldn't care at all.

1228
01:36:00,463 --> 01:36:02,840
In your condition,
you're worried about them?

1229
01:36:02,924 --> 01:36:07,219
She has this fixation that she's a burden.
But she's our daughter!

1230
01:36:07,303 --> 01:36:10,806
Why do you say that?
It's not true at all.

1231
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:11,974
She's always working.

1232
01:36:12,058 --> 01:36:14,060
She's excellent at keeping the books.

1233
01:36:14,143 --> 01:36:16,395
And she embroiders. Just look at her work.

1234
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:20,900
Let me show <i>Monsignore.</i>
Look how beautiful.

1235
01:36:21,817 --> 01:36:23,277
That's her work.

1236
01:36:26,155 --> 01:36:27,531
Was she born this way?

1237
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:31,661
No, it happened when she was nine. Polio.

1238
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:38,209
Mother, go back inside.

1239
01:36:45,591 --> 01:36:48,427
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

1240
01:36:49,971 --> 01:36:51,138
Nine years old...

1241
01:36:51,722 --> 01:36:53,975
I'm just fine here!

1242
01:36:54,058 --> 01:36:55,851
I have my embroidery.

1243
01:36:56,519 --> 01:36:58,145
I listen to music.

1244
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:02,775
I feel like a queen.

1245
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:09,240
It's my sister who has a hard life.

1246
01:37:10,157 --> 01:37:14,161
She's been out working in the fields
since 4:00 am.

1247
01:37:14,704 --> 01:37:16,372
Wouldn't you like to get better?

1248
01:37:19,458 --> 01:37:23,713
But that's impossible...

1249
01:37:25,131 --> 01:37:26,257
isn't it?

1250
01:37:29,719 --> 01:37:31,804
It would take a miracle.

1251
01:37:33,889 --> 01:37:36,684
Miracles happen sometimes.

1252
01:37:37,309 --> 01:37:38,894
Yes, I know.

1253
01:37:40,813 --> 01:37:42,148
Do you believe that?

1254
01:37:43,566 --> 01:37:45,067
Yes, I do.

1255
01:37:46,527 --> 01:37:47,737
Why?

1256
01:37:49,321 --> 01:37:51,866
I don't know why, but I do.

1257
01:37:55,286 --> 01:37:58,956
Through my misfortune, I've found God.

1258
01:38:00,916 --> 01:38:02,752
I'm always happy...

1259
01:38:03,586 --> 01:38:06,714
even when I'm in terrible pain.

1260
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:22,480
This is beautiful embroidery.

1261
01:38:24,273 --> 01:38:25,649
Are you leaving?

1262
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:30,029
I have to go now.

1263
01:38:30,863 --> 01:38:32,114
I have to go.

1264
01:38:38,746 --> 01:38:40,456
You don't need me.

1265
01:38:42,208 --> 01:38:44,710
You're better off
than lots of other people.

1266
01:38:46,879 --> 01:38:48,297
Our lives...

1267
01:38:50,674 --> 01:38:54,386
the lives of so many people I know,

1268
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:56,055
lack any beauty.

1269
01:38:57,348 --> 01:38:59,016
You're not missing much.

1270
01:39:01,769 --> 01:39:03,437
No, you don't need me.

1271
01:39:05,272 --> 01:39:07,691
And I have nothing to give you.

1272
01:39:10,069 --> 01:39:12,780
<i>Monsignore,</i> wait!

1273
01:39:12,863 --> 01:39:14,031
Don't go!

1274
01:39:29,505 --> 01:39:31,799
Pray for me!

1275
01:39:31,882 --> 01:39:33,342
Let go of me!

1276
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:17,678
Could you have dug that hole
any deeper this morning?

1277
01:40:17,761 --> 01:40:21,557
You made me sweat like crazy.
What's the point of digging so deep?

1278
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:24,602
- How did it go?
- 350,000 lire.

1279
01:40:24,685 --> 01:40:26,312
We could've made more.

1280
01:40:26,395 --> 01:40:29,481
But it's all he had on him,
and we wanted to get going.

1281
01:40:29,565 --> 01:40:32,276
You did well. I didn't expect you so soon.

1282
01:40:35,821 --> 01:40:36,989
Who has the keys?

1283
01:40:37,072 --> 01:40:38,991
He does. Give him the keys.

1284
01:40:39,533 --> 01:40:41,202
What's that tune called?

1285
01:40:41,285 --> 01:40:45,247
The "Con Man's Symphony."

1286
01:40:46,665 --> 01:40:51,128
You're getting careless
with that "treasure," my friend.

1287
01:40:51,212 --> 01:40:53,881
Any idiot could have seen it was phony.

1288
01:40:53,964 --> 01:40:55,216
What are you talking about?

1289
01:40:55,299 --> 01:40:58,344
Remember the time in Viterbo
when I put pieces of glass in it?

1290
01:40:58,427 --> 01:41:01,639
- Yeah, I know.
- These peasants are such gullible fools!

1291
01:41:01,722 --> 01:41:03,974
What an isolated spot!

1292
01:41:04,058 --> 01:41:06,477
Would you like a nice house up here, eh?

1293
01:41:11,941 --> 01:41:13,442
Is there no echo here?

1294
01:41:19,531 --> 01:41:22,701
- Where's the cognac bottle?
- I drank it.

1295
01:41:22,785 --> 01:41:25,454
The way I was sweating,
I could have caught pneumonia.

1296
01:41:25,537 --> 01:41:29,333
I've had a pain here since this morning.
I told my wife about it.

1297
01:41:29,416 --> 01:41:32,544
She said, "You work too hard,"
and it's true.

1298
01:41:32,628 --> 01:41:35,774
- Where's the bottle? Ah, no, here it is!
- What are you doing with that bottle?

1299
01:41:35,798 --> 01:41:38,968
Adding more water.
I had to drive up the hill in second gear.

1300
01:41:39,051 --> 01:41:41,451
- When are you gonna junk this jalopy?
- Who's got the money?

1301
01:41:42,137 --> 01:41:44,014
Augusto.

1302
01:41:50,479 --> 01:41:52,690
You really are a pack of vultures.

1303
01:41:52,773 --> 01:41:56,026
I don't have the money. I didn't take it.

1304
01:42:02,783 --> 01:42:05,160
How could we possibly take it?

1305
01:42:05,244 --> 01:42:08,622
You wretches!
You'd even rob your own mothers!

1306
01:42:08,706 --> 01:42:10,124
What are you saying?

1307
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,876
I couldn't do it, Vargas.

1308
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:15,337
I didn't have the heart.

1309
01:42:15,421 --> 01:42:19,008
It was a poor old guy
with a crippled daughter,

1310
01:42:19,091 --> 01:42:21,176
working to keep her out of a hospice.

1311
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:23,012
Don't make me laugh. What's he saying?

1312
01:42:23,095 --> 01:42:25,889
I saw you take it!

1313
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:28,517
- I gave it back.
- When?

1314
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:30,269
I gave it back, okay?

1315
01:42:44,825 --> 01:42:47,578
You're the biggest hypocrite I ever met.

1316
01:42:47,661 --> 01:42:51,832
You had your paws on 350,000
and you let it go? You of all people?

1317
01:42:53,459 --> 01:42:56,712
Have I ever cheated you?
I said I couldn't do it.

1318
01:42:57,338 --> 01:42:59,214
There's no point looking. It's not there.

1319
01:42:59,298 --> 01:43:00,966
Let's see if I find the money.

1320
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:04,053
You were all in the car.
I was the one who spoke to the girl.

1321
01:43:04,928 --> 01:43:08,432
A poor girl stuck in a chair
for nine years,

1322
01:43:08,515 --> 01:43:10,392
who knows she'll never get better.

1323
01:43:10,476 --> 01:43:13,771
She looks you in the eye,
kisses your hand,

1324
01:43:13,854 --> 01:43:15,481
asks you to pray for her.

1325
01:43:16,357 --> 01:43:18,984
I'd like to see what you guys
would have done.

1326
01:43:20,235 --> 01:43:22,946
I have a daughter too. I couldn't do it.

1327
01:43:23,781 --> 01:43:27,618
All this effort and risk, all for nothing.
We risked going to jail!

1328
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:29,244
Have you gone crazy?

1329
01:43:29,328 --> 01:43:30,871
Can't I have a conscience too?

1330
01:43:30,954 --> 01:43:32,414
That'd be a new one!

1331
01:43:35,542 --> 01:43:36,919
Is it really true?

1332
01:43:39,296 --> 01:43:40,422
I swear.

1333
01:43:44,885 --> 01:43:45,886
Let's go.

1334
01:43:46,637 --> 01:43:49,973
Hold it. We're all friends here.

1335
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:53,936
Fine words, but I don't believe you!
Let me look!

1336
01:43:54,019 --> 01:43:55,396
Get off me!

1337
01:43:56,480 --> 01:44:00,567
- Keep your hands off!
- What are you doing? Come here.

1338
01:44:00,651 --> 01:44:03,987
I was there too, remember?

1339
01:44:04,071 --> 01:44:06,323
I saw you take it. You're pulling our leg.

1340
01:44:06,407 --> 01:44:08,867
Thanks for the laugh,
but enough is enough.

1341
01:44:08,951 --> 01:44:10,661
- I haven't got it!
- Search him!

1342
01:44:10,744 --> 01:44:14,289
If you haven't got it, what's the problem?
Let us take a look.

1343
01:44:14,373 --> 01:44:15,999
Get your hands off me!

1344
01:44:17,292 --> 01:44:20,212
Damn you, you hurt me!

1345
01:44:20,295 --> 01:44:22,423
He's got the money on him!

1346
01:44:22,506 --> 01:44:25,676
Come on! Just try it!

1347
01:44:25,759 --> 01:44:29,680
- I'm not afraid of you.
- You think this ends here?

1348
01:44:36,145 --> 01:44:38,480
What kind of scum are you?

1349
01:44:38,564 --> 01:44:41,108
Let him have it! Tear his tongue out!

1350
01:44:44,111 --> 01:44:47,489
You scoundrel! So you wanted to cheat me?

1351
01:44:47,573 --> 01:44:51,326
You'll bring it to me on your knees!

1352
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:59,168
I'll kill you!

1353
01:45:03,046 --> 01:45:04,506
Where do you think you're going?

1354
01:45:05,382 --> 01:45:07,217
Where do you think you're going?

1355
01:45:40,459 --> 01:45:41,835
My back...

1356
01:45:42,544 --> 01:45:44,755
- Where is it?
- Don't!

1357
01:45:45,797 --> 01:45:46,924
My back!

1358
01:45:49,676 --> 01:45:52,679
- Where is it? Where did he put it?
- My back!

1359
01:45:52,763 --> 01:45:54,932
- Stop!
- Here it is!

1360
01:45:55,015 --> 01:45:57,559
The bastard had it in his shoe!

1361
01:45:58,727 --> 01:46:01,647
He had it hidden on him!

1362
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:06,109
No, that's mine. I need it.
Leave me alone!

1363
01:46:06,193 --> 01:46:08,695
He's got it all on him!

1364
01:46:09,279 --> 01:46:11,990
- Where's the money?
- Here. Count it.

1365
01:46:12,074 --> 01:46:13,492
Swine.

1366
01:46:13,575 --> 01:46:16,161
Here's the money. Filthy coward.

1367
01:46:17,746 --> 01:46:20,499
- Give me the money.
- It's in his shoes, his pockets. All over.

1368
01:46:21,124 --> 01:46:22,709
A crippled daughter?

1369
01:46:23,293 --> 01:46:24,878
A crippled daughter!

1370
01:46:25,754 --> 01:46:27,965
You're through working with me

1371
01:46:28,048 --> 01:46:30,092
or anyone else in Rome.

1372
01:46:30,676 --> 01:46:32,928
I almost fell for it.

1373
01:46:33,011 --> 01:46:34,471
The bastard!

1374
01:46:34,555 --> 01:46:38,016
Let's go. Let's leave him here
to manage on his own.

1375
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:41,562
And you'll get arrested in Rome!
What a bastard!

1376
01:46:41,645 --> 01:46:42,813
Vargas...

1377
01:46:44,106 --> 01:46:45,232
I'm hurt.

1378
01:46:45,691 --> 01:46:48,527
Go to hell! Let's go.

1379
01:46:50,112 --> 01:46:54,324
Your buddies are giving you
a nice little vacation in the countryside.

1380
01:46:54,408 --> 01:46:58,912
That was the dumbest trick
you ever tried to pull.

1381
01:46:59,538 --> 01:47:02,708
Vargas... I'm hurt!

1382
01:47:04,793 --> 01:47:08,839
- Riccardo, I'm really hurt.
- Who you trying to dupe?

1383
01:47:11,508 --> 01:47:14,511
Vargas... don't leave me.

1384
01:47:15,637 --> 01:47:16,972
I'm hurt.

1385
01:47:17,889 --> 01:47:19,224
I'm really hurt.

1386
01:47:21,935 --> 01:47:23,270
I can't move.

1387
01:47:27,774 --> 01:47:28,775
Riccardo.

1388
01:47:29,735 --> 01:47:30,986
Riccardo, listen to me.

1389
01:47:32,279 --> 01:47:34,448
- You're my friend.
- Yeah, right!

1390
01:47:34,531 --> 01:47:36,116
Don't leave me here.

1391
01:47:37,034 --> 01:47:38,410
You're young.

1392
01:47:40,495 --> 01:47:43,373
I can teach you...

1393
01:47:46,168 --> 01:47:47,836
I can teach you so much.

1394
01:47:47,919 --> 01:47:50,047
To be a bastard like you?

1395
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:51,632
I have money stashed away.

1396
01:47:56,637 --> 01:47:58,972
We'll split it. Just don't leave me here!

1397
01:48:01,099 --> 01:48:04,519
Vargas, I know you're there.

1398
01:48:06,355 --> 01:48:08,690
Are you trying to scare me?

1399
01:48:10,484 --> 01:48:11,943
That's enough.

1400
01:48:52,359 --> 01:48:55,112
Of course they'll come back.

1401
01:48:58,990 --> 01:49:00,200
What if I die?

1402
01:49:03,328 --> 01:49:04,955
I can't die like this.

1403
01:49:07,165 --> 01:49:11,128
But... if I die...

1404
01:49:14,256 --> 01:49:16,174
Help! Help!

1405
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:19,886
Help!

1406
01:49:25,267 --> 01:49:27,811
I knew it would end like this.

1407
01:49:28,854 --> 01:49:30,397
I always knew it.

1408
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:40,407
What's the point of going on?

1409
01:49:42,367 --> 01:49:44,453
I don't have to look after anyone.

1410
01:49:48,165 --> 01:49:49,791
That's why I'm going to die.

1411
01:50:17,235 --> 01:50:18,445
I can't remember...

1412
01:50:20,447 --> 01:50:23,533
Oh, Patrizia, my child...

1413
01:50:58,485 --> 01:51:00,070
I'm better now.

1414
01:51:01,446 --> 01:51:02,614
I can do it.

1415
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:04,783
I can do it.

1416
01:52:41,546 --> 01:52:42,923
Wait for me.

1417
01:52:49,763 --> 01:52:50,972
I'm coming.

1418
01:52:55,685 --> 01:52:57,270
I'm coming with you...

1419
01:53:34,891 --> 01:53:40,146
THE END
