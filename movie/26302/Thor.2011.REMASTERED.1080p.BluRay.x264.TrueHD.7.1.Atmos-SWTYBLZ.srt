00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,810
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}摧毁他们的意志
Break their spirits

107
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,020
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}让他们再不敢试图侵入我国疆界半步
so they'll never dare try to cross our borders again.

108
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,400
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你这只是个战士的想法
You're thinking only as a warrior.

109
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,730
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}这就是个战争行为
This was an act of war!

110
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,070
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}那是几个人的行为 注定失败
It was the act of but a few, doomed to fail.

111

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}看他们都跑到哪来了
Look how far they got!

112
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,110
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我们会找到并修补这些防御上的漏洞
We will find the breach in our defenses and it will be sealed.

113
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,570
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}身为阿斯加德国王...
As King of Asgard...

114
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,410
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}可你不是国王
But you're not king!

115
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,660
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}暂时不是
Not yet.

116
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,410
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你现在呆在我身边很不明智啊 弟弟
It's unwise to be in my company right now, Brother.

117
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,330
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}今天本是我加冕之日
This was to be my day of triumph.

118
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,870
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}它会到来的
It'll come.

119
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,460
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}迟早而已
In time.

120
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,790
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}出什么事了
What's this?

121
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,380
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}不是想安慰你 但我认为你是对的
If it's any consolation, I think you're right.

122
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,300
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}关于冰巨人 劳菲 所有的事情
About the Frost Giants, about Laufey, about everything.

123
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,260
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}倘若他们找到了一次突破阿斯加德防御的方法
If they found a way to penetrate Asgard's defenses once,

124
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,890
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}谁能保证他们不会再次尝试
who's to say they won't try again?

125
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,020
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}- 下次则带领着千军万马  - 没错
- Next time with an army.  - Exactly.

126
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,890
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}不违抗父命 你什么也做不了
There's nothing you can do without defying Father.

127
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,900
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}别 别 别 我看得懂你的表情
No, no, no. I know that look.

128
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,190
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}那是确保边境安全唯一的方法
That's the only way to ensure the safety of our borders.

129
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,360
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}索尔 这太疯狂了
Thor, it's madness.

Madness? What sort of madness?

131

We're going to Jotunheim.

132
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,200
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}啥
What?

133
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,490
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}这可跟去趟地球不一样
This isn't like a journey to Earth

134
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,620
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}不是个你随随便便召唤点闪电 雷霆
where you summon a little lightning and thunder,

135
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,370
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}就能被凡人们供奉为神祗的地方
and the mortals worship you as a god.

136

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}这可是约顿海姆啊
This is Jotunheim.

137

My father fought his way into Jotunheim,

defeated their armies and took their Casket.

139
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,720
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我们只是去寻找答案而已
We would just be looking for answers.

140
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,090
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}这是明令禁止的
It is forbidden!

141
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,430
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}朋友们 你们难道忘了咱们一起干过的事了
My friends, have you forgotten all that we have done together?

And Volstagg, to delicacies so succulent,

146

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}让你飘飘欲仙如同置身瓦尔哈拉殿堂
you thought you'd died and gone to Valhalla?

147

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}是你

And who proved wrong all who scoffed at the idea

150

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}是我
I did.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}什么
I'm sorry?

159

I wish to know how that happened.

164
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,040

Then tell no one where we have gone until we've returned.

If your return threatens the safety of Asgard,

170

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你们将被留在约顿海姆寒冷的荒野里等死
and you'll be left to die in the cold waste of Jotunheim.

172
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,860
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你就不能为我们一直开着彩虹桥吗
Couldn't you just leave the bridge open for us?

173

Where are they?

181
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,690
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}藏起来了吧
Hiding,

182
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,360
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}懦夫都这样
as cowards always do.

183
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:34,090
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你们千里迢迢前来送死啊 阿斯加德人
You've come a long way to die, Asgardians.

184

We know who you are.

186

How did your people get into Asgard?

187

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}奥丁的家族里有很多叛徒
The House of Odin is full of traitors.

188

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你休想说谎玷污我父亲圣名
Do not dishonour my father's name with your lies!

189
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,450
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你父亲既是个杀人凶手又是个贼
Your father is a murderer and a thief!

190
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,910
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}那你又是为何而来呢 为了讲和吗
And why have you come here? To make peace?

191

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你期待着 渴望着战斗
You long for battle. You crave it.

192

You're nothing but a boy

193

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}企图证明自己是个男子汉
trying to prove himself a man.

194
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,210

Well, this "boy" has grown tired of your mockery.

195
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,350
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}索尔 停下来动动脑筋
Thor, stop and think.

196

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你看看周围 我们寡不敌众
Look around you, we're outnumbered.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}注意身份 老弟
Know your place, Brother.

198

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你不知道此举会带来什么后果
You know not what your actions would unleash.

199

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我可知道
I do.

200

At least make it a challenge for me!

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}这还差不多
That's more like it.

208

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}除非小熊座打算休一天假
and unless Ursa Minor decided to take a day off,

313
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,580
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}不然这些是别处的星座
these are someone else's constellations.

314
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,500
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}快来看这个
Hey! Check this out.

315
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,090
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}不 不可能
No, it can't be.

316
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:16,260
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我想我把什么东西丢在医院了
I think I left something at the hospital.

317
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:33,860
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}不可能
It's not possible!

318
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,250
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}他肯定嗑药了 他疯了
He was on drugs or something. He just went nuts.

319
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,550
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}天啊
Oh, my God.

320
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:06,100
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我把最重要的证据弄丢了
I just lost my most important piece of evidence.

321
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,230
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}总这样
Typical.

322
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,480
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}- 那现在干嘛  - 我们去找他
- So now what?  - We find him.

323
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,940
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你没看到他在那儿做了什么吗
Did you see what he did in there?

324
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,820
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我不确定找到他是个好主意
I'm not sure finding him is the best idea.

325
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,230
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我们的数据无法解释那种现象的内部情况
Well, our data can't tell us what it was like to be inside that event,

326
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,990
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}而他能 所以我们要找到他
and he can. So, we're gonna find him.

327
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,110
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}好吧
Okay.

328
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,820
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}所以 我们要找遍整个新墨西哥州 对吧
So we're gonna look all over New Mexico, right?

329
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,240
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}完全正确
Exactly.

330
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,540
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}什么
What?

331
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,750
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}真抱歉 我发誓我不是故意的
I'm so sorry. I swear I'm not doing this on purpose.

332
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,440
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}到我了 到我了
I got it, I got it.

333
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,070
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}快 踩油门
Come on, kick it in now!

334
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,960
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}成功了吗
Did it work?

335
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,900
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}长官 我们找到了
Sir, we found it.

336
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,490
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}作为一个发疯的流浪汉 他身材真不错
You know, for a crazy homeless person, he's pretty cut.

337
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,620
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}嘿 很抱歉我电击了你
Hey, sorry I tased you!

338
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,040
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}不好意思 抱歉
Excuse me, excuse me!

339
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,800
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}这是什么
What is this?

340
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,970
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我前男友
My ex.

341
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,520
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}好医生 坏男友
Good with patients and bad with relationships.

342
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,020
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我只有这些衣服你能穿
They're the only clothes I had that would fit you.

343
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,150
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}这就够了
They will suffice.

344
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,230
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}不客气
You're welcome.

345
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,780
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}这具凡人的躯体变虚弱了
This mortal form has grown weak.

346
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,700
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我需要食物
I need sustenance.

347
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,760
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我们不应该让他走的
We should never have let him go.

348
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:46,510
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}那时没什么能阻止他
There was no stopping him.

349
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,550
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}至少他只是被流放了 而不是死了
Well, at least he's only banished, not dead.

350
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,930
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}如果守卫没有告诉奥丁
Which is what we'd all be

351
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,730
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我们去哪了 我们都已经死了
if that guard hadn't told Odin where we'd gone.

352
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,610
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}守卫是怎么知道的
How did the guard even know?

353
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,190
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我说的
I told him.

354
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,700
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}什么
What?

355
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,360
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我告诉他我们一走就去找奥丁
I told him to go to Odin after we'd left.

356
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,870
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}拖那么长时间 他应该被鞭打
He should be flogged for taking so long.

357
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,490
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我们不该去约顿海姆
We should never have reached Jotunheim.

358
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,620
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你告诉守卫的
You told the guard?

359
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,700
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我救了大家的命
I saved our lives.

360
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,620
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}还有索尔的
And Thor's.

361
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,170
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我不知道父王会因此流放他
I had no idea Father would banish him for what he did.

362
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,380
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}洛基
Loki.

363
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:23,920
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你必须去找众神之父 说服他改变主意
You must go to the Allfather and convince him to change his mind.

364
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,630
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}就算我这样做了 然后呢
And if I do, then what?

365
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,550
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我比你们谁都爱索尔 但是你们也了解他
I love Thor more dearly than any of you, but you know what he is.

366
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,770
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}傲慢 鲁莽 危险
He's arrogant. He's reckless. He's dangerous.

367
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,810
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你们看到他今天的样子了
You saw how he was today.

368
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,560
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}这就是阿斯加德需要的国王吗
Is that what Asgard needs from its king?

369
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:46,070
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}他嘴上说是为了阿斯加德好 但他一直嫉妒索尔
He may speak of the good of Asgard, but he's always been jealous of Thor.

370
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:49,240
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我们应该感激他 他救了我们
We should be grateful to him, he saved our lives.

371
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:51,410
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}劳菲说过
Laufey said

372
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,990
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}奥丁的家族里有叛徒
there were traitors in the House of Odin.

373
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:58,920
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}法师能够把三个约顿族人带到阿斯加德
A master of magic could bring three Jotuns into Asgard.

374
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,420
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}洛基总是喜欢恶作剧
Loki's always been one for mischief,

375
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,920
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}但你说的完全是另外一回事
but you're talking about something else entirely.

376
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,780
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}住手
Stop!

377
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:31,950
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我受到诅咒了吗
Am I cursed?

378
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,450
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}没有
No.

379
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,790
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我是谁
What am I?

380
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,290
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你是我儿子
You're my son.

381
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,470
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}除此之外呢
What more than that?

382
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,900
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}那天你不只从约顿海姆拿走了宝匣
The Casket wasn't the only thing you took from Jotunheim that day,

383
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:01,980
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}不是吗
was it?

384
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,070
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}是
No.

385
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,240
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}战争结束后
In the aftermath of the battle,

386
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,160
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我走进神殿 发现了一名婴儿
I went into the temple and I found a baby.

387
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,500
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}幼小得不像巨人的孩子
Small for a giant's offspring.

388
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,840
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}被遗弃 遭受痛苦 自生自灭
Abandoned, suffering, left to die.

389
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,510
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}是劳菲的儿子
Laufey's son.

390
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,010
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}劳菲的儿子
Laufey's son.

391
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,850
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}对
Yes.

392
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,440
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}为什么
Why?

393
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:46,190
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你浑身沾满了约顿族人的血 为什么还要把我带走
You were knee-deep in Jotun blood, why would you take me?

394
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,780
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你是无辜的
You were an innocent child.

395
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:51,860
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}不 你是有目的的 为了什么
No. You took me for a purpose. What was it?

396
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,530
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}告诉我
Tell me!

397
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,040
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我以为有一天两国能联合
I thought we could unite our kingdoms one day.

398
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:05,460
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}结为同盟 带来永久的和平
Bring about an alliance, bring about permanent peace.

399
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,130
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}通过你
Through you.

400
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:08,380
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}什么
What?

401
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,800
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}但那些计划已经无关紧要了
But those plans no longer matter.

402
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,640
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}所以我只是另一个偷来的纪念品
So I am no more than another stolen relic,

403
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,180
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}被关在这儿 直到你用得着我
locked up here until you might have use of me.

404
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,720
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}为什么你要曲解我的话
Why do you twist my words?

405
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,810
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你一开始就应该告诉我的
You could have told me what I was from the beginning,

406
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:23,890
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}为什么不告诉我
Why didn't you?

407
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,310
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你是我儿子
You're my son.

408
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,980
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我只想保护你不被真相伤害
I wanted only to protect you from the truth.

409
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,070
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}因为我是
Because I'm the monster

410

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}父母在夜晚给孩子们讲的怪物
parents tell their children about at night?

411
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,410
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}- 不 不  - 现在一切都说得通了
- No, no.  - You know, it all makes sense now!

412
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:38,240
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}为什么这些年你偏爱索尔
Why you favoured Thor all these years!

413
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:41,200
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}因为不管你声称有多爱我
Because no matter how much you claim to love me,

414
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,920
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}都不会让冰巨人坐在阿斯加德的王位上
you could never have a Frost Giant sitting on the throne of Asgard!

415
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,270
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}守卫
Guards!

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你错过了陨石坑那儿有意思的事
You missed all the excitement out at the crater.

432
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:03,080
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}他们说有卫星坠落在沙漠里
They're saying some kind of satellite landed out in the desert.

433

until the Feds showed up.

435

Excuse me. Did you say there was a satellite crash?

436

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}对
Yeah.

437
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,380
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}天呐 我得把这发到脸书上 笑一个
Oh, my God. This is going on Facebook. Smile.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}那个卫星长什么样
What did it look like, the satellite?

439
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:21,430
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我不懂卫星 但它很重
I don't know anything about satellites, but it was heavy.

440
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:25,680
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我是说 没人能搬得动它
I mean, nobody could lift it.

441
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:28,440
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}他们说那个卫星有辐射 我还摸了它
They said it was radioactive. I had my hands all over it.

442
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,190
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}怎么过去
Which way?

443
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,360
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}从这向西50英里
Fifty miles west of here.

444
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:36,400
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}别浪费时间啦
Well, I wouldn't waste my time!

445
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:38,240
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我们走的时候好像整个部队都来了
Looked like the whole Army was coming when we left.

446
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,660
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}笨蛋
Dumbass!

447

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你去哪儿
Where are you going?

448
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,250
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}- 从这向西50英里  - 为什么
- Fifty miles west of here.  - Why?

449
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:52,710
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}- 拿回属于我的东西  - 你拥有一颗卫星
- To get what belongs to me.  - So you own a satellite now?

450
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:53,790
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}不是他们说的那样
It's not what they say it is.

451
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,920
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}不管是什么
Well, whatever it is,

452
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,340
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}政府似乎认为那是他们的
the government seems to think it's theirs.

453
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,470
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你打算就这么过去拿走它
So, you just intend to go in there and take it?

454
00:43:58,550 --> 00:43:59,630
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}没错
Yes.

455
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:02,300
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}如果你现在载我去那
If you take me there now,

456
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,050
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我会告诉你想知道的一切
I'll tell you everything you wish to know.

457
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:05,640
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}- 一切  - 对
- Everything?  - Yes.

458
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,520
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}等我拿回雷神之锤姆乔尔尼尔 你就会得到想要的答案
All the answers you seek will be yours once I reclaim Mjolnir.

459

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}喵麽 什么是喵麽
Myeu-muh? What's Myeu-muh?

460
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:12,690
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我能跟你谈谈吗 简
Can I have a word, Jane?

461
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:18,240
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}别这么做
Please don't do this.

462
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:20,400
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}昨天你也看到了
You saw what I saw last night.

463
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:22,910
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}这不是巧合 我们得知道陨石坑里的是什么
This is no coincidence. We have to find out what's in that crater.

464
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:24,950
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我不是说陨石坑 而是说他
But I'm not talking about the crater, I'm talking about him.

465
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,740
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}- 但他承诺给我们答案  - 他有妄想症
- But he's promising us the answers.  - He's delusional.

466
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:28,870
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}听听他都说了些什么
Listen to what he's saying.

467
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:32,880
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}什么雷神之锤 雷神还有彩虹桥
He's talking about Mjolnir and Thor and Bifrost.

468
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:35,420
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我就是听这些故事长大的
It's the stories I grew up with as a child.

469
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,340
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我只是载他过去 仅此而已
I'm just going to drive him. That's it.

470
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,550
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}他很危险 简
He's dangerous, Jane.

471
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:49,390
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}很抱歉 我不能载你去
I'm sorry, but I can't take you.

472

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}那就此分别吧
Then this is where we say goodbye.

Let it go? This is my life.

487

We're investigating a security threat.

488
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:01,300

We need to appropriate your records and all your atmospheric data.

489

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}还会昏迷多久
How long will it last?

573
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:31,230
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我不知道 这次的情况不一样 我们毫无准备
I don't know. This time it's different. We were unprepared.

574
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,150
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}他为什么骗我
So why did he lie?

575
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:40,240
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}他不让你知道真相 这样你就永远不会觉得自己不同

584
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:38,290
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}而不该在它周围建起一座城市
they wouldn't have built a city around it.

585
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:43,220
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}- 你会需要这个的  - 什么 等等 为什么
- You're going to need this.  - What? Wait, why?

587
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:51,810

No. Look what's down there.

590
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,770
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你以为你可以大摇大摆地走进去 拿起我们的东西 然后走出来吗
You think you're just gonna walk in, grab our stuff and walk out?

591

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}不 我会飞出来
No. I'm going to fly out.

592
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:11,580

You want me to slow him down, sir?

622
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:57,790
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}还是要多派些人来活捉他
Or are you sending in more guys for him to beat up?

623
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:59,500
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}等我命令
I'll let you know.

You're big.

625
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,140
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}再大力点
Fought bigger.

626
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,480
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}最好下命令吧 科尔森 因为我要干掉这家伙了
Better call it, Coulson, 'cause I'm starting to root for this guy.

627
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,170
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}最后问一次 长官
Last chance, sir.

628

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}等等 我想看看这个
Wait. I want to see this.

629
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:42,370
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}好了 表演结束 地面部队 进入
All right, show's over. Ground units, move in.

630
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,050
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}他犯了罪 他进监狱了
He committed a crime. He's in jail!

631
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:39,300
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}- 我不能把他留在那里  - 为什么
- I can't just leave him there!  - Why?

632
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:41,550
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你不知道我看见了什么
You didn't see what I saw!

633
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,890
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}看 看 这是那什么喵麽
Look! Look, it's Myeu-muh.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你在哪里找到这个的
Where'd you find this?

635
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:51,140
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}童话书
The children's section.

636
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:53,650
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我只是想让你知道他的故事有多无聊
I just wanted to show you how silly his story was.

637
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:55,650
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}可你是那个一直鼓励我
But you're the one who's always pushing me

638
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:57,860
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}追寻所有可能 所有选择的人
to chase down every possibility, every alternative!

639
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:00,190
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我鼓励的是科学 不是魔幻
I'm talking about science, not magic!

640
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,530
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}魔幻只是一种我们还不懂的科学而已
Well, magic's just science that we don't understand yet.

641
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:05,240
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}- 亚瑟·C·克拉克  - 他是个科幻小说家
- Arthur C. Clarke.  - Who wrote science fiction.

642
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,830
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}- 也是一位追寻科学真相的先驱  - 一定程度上来说 没错
- A precursor to science fact!  - In some cases, yeah.

643
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:09,580
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}如果真的有爱因斯坦-罗森桥
Well, if there is an Einstein-Rosen Bridge,

644
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:11,040
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}那么桥的另一边一定有什么存在
then there's something on the other side.

645
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,830
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}先进的人类有可能越过这座桥
And advanced beings could have crossed it!

646
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}简
Jane.

647
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:17,090
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}像维京人一样的原始部落可能就会把他们当神崇拜
A primitive culture like the Vikings might have worshipped them as deities.

648
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:18,920
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}没错 正是如此 谢谢
Yes! Yes, exactly. Thank you.

649
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:27,850
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你让我的手下
You made my men,

650
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:30,390
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}世界上受过最好训练的专业队伍
some of the most highly trained professionals in the world,

651
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:33,270
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}看上去像是一支最廉价的商场保安
look like a bunch of minimum-wage mall cops.

652
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:36,310
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}太伤人了
That's hurtful.

653
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:40,860
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}从我的经验来看 一个接受过相同训练的人
In my experience, it takes someone who's received similar training

654
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,360
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}才能做出那样的事情
to do what you did to them.

655
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:46,530
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}为何不告诉我你在哪里接受的训练
Why don't you tell me where you received your training?

656
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:50,490
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}巴基斯坦 车臣 阿富汗
Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan?

657
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:55,000
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}不 我觉得你更像是个佣兵
No, you strike me more as the soldier of fortune type.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}在哪里 南非
Where was it? South Africa?

659
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:04,090
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}有许多组织愿意付高价雇佣你这样的人
Certain groups pay very well for a good mercenary like you.

660

Who are you?

661
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:15,230
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}用尽各种办法 找到我们想知道的答案
One way or another, we find out what we need to know.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我们很擅长这个
We're good at that.

663
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:23,990
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}哪儿都不要去
Don't go anywhere.

664
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:32,950
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}洛基 你在这里做什么
Loki! What are you doing here?

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我一定要见你
I had to see you.

Tell me. Is it Jotunheim?

668
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:41,880
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}让我跟父亲解释
Let me explain to Father.

669
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,300
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}父亲死了
Father is dead.

670
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:50,810
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}什么
What?

671
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,310
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你的放逐
Your banishment,

672
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:57,480
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}新战争的威胁
the threat of a new war,

673
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:00,310
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}他已经承受不住了
it was too much for him to bear.

674
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:05,150
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你不要自责
You mustn't blame yourself.

675
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:07,490
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我知道你爱他
I know that you loved him.

676
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:11,160
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我也想这么告诉他 但他就是不听
I tried to tell him so, but he wouldn't listen.

677
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:15,660
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}明知你再也拿不起锤子 却把它放在你
It was so cruel to put the hammer within your reach,

678
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,710
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}触手可及的地方 这真是太残忍了
knowing that you could never lift it.

679
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,300
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}王位的重担现在落在我身上了
The burden of the throne has fallen to me now.

680
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:31,550
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我能回家吗
Can I come home?

681
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:35,470

The truce with Jotunheim is conditional upon your exile.

682
01:03:35,810 --> 01:03:41,940
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}- 没错 但我们不能想办法...  - 而且母亲禁止你回去
- Yes, but couldn't we find a way...  - And Mother has forbidden your return.

683

No.

686
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,170

I am sorry.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}有人来看他
He's got a visitor.

694
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:19,330

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你的合作伙伴很危险 赛尔维格博士
You have dangerous coworkers, Dr Selvig.

697
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:27,340
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}当他发现你拿走了我们的所有研究后 他心急如焚
He was distraught when he found out that you've taken all our research.

698
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,420
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}他几年来的心血 就这么没了
That was years of his life, gone!

699
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:34,680
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你能理解一个男人突然失去理智
You can understand how a man could go off like that.

700
01:05:35,090 --> 01:05:37,220
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}像你们这样庞大匿名的组织
A big, faceless organisation like yours

701
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,220
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}率领一群穿着长筒靴的暴徒进来 然后...
coming in with their jackbooted thugs and...

702

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}他就是这么被激怒的
That's how he put it.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}这仍然不能解释
That still doesn't explain

704
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:45,770
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}他是如何成功突破我们的安全防线的
how he managed to tear through our security.

705
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:49,440
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}类固醇 他算是个健身狂
Steroids! He's a bit of a fitness nut.

706
01:05:51,110 --> 01:05:52,280

It says here that he's an M.D.

709

I will!

718
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:43,500

I had it all wrong.

722

It's not a bad thing finding out that you don't have all the answers.

723

724
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:14,860
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我人生中第一次
For the first time in my life,

725
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:19,570
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}不知道自己该做什么
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.

726
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:23,580
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}每个即将在世界上找到自己的路的人
Anyone who's ever going to find his way in this world

727
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:26,790
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}必须从承认他不知道自己到底在哪开始
has to start by admitting he doesn't know where the hell he is.

728
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:30,290
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}谢谢你做的一切
Thank you for what you've done.

729
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:32,800
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}不 别谢我 我只是为了简
No, don't thank me. I only did it for Jane.

730
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:37,050
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我和她父亲都在大学教书
Her father and I taught at university together.

731
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:38,970
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}他生前是个好人
He was a good man.

732
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:41,050
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}他从不听别人的意见
He never listened.

733
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:43,970
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我也是
Neither did I.

734
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:47,310
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我父亲曾想要教会我一些道理
My father was trying to teach me something,

735
01:07:47,390 --> 01:07:49,310
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}但我太笨了 没能明白
but I was too stupid to see it.

736
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,440
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我不知道你是妄想的还是你在实施诈骗之类的
I don't know if you're delusional or if you're pulling some kind of con,

737
01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:55,860
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我不在乎
I don't care.

738
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:57,280
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我只在乎她
I just care about her.

739
01:07:58,650 --> 01:08:01,070
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我知道她看你的样子
I've seen the way she looks at you.

740
01:08:04,410 --> 01:08:07,000
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我向你发誓 我无意伤害她
I swear to you, I mean her no harm.

741
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,250
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}很好
Good.

742
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:12,920
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}这样的话 我再请你喝一轮 然后你今晚就离开镇子
In that case, I'll buy you another round, and you leave town tonight.

743
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:19,930
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}两杯深水炸弹
Two boilermakers.

744
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,100
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}杀了他
Kill him.

745
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:16,690
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}在我为你做了那么多之后
After all I've done for you?

746
01:09:19,070 --> 01:09:23,700
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你就是那个告诉我们进入阿斯加德的方法的人
So you're the one who showed us the way into Asgard.

747
01:09:24,030 --> 01:09:26,200
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}那真的只是增添一点乐趣
That was just a bit of fun, really.

748
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:30,370
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}为了破坏我哥哥的重要日子
To ruin my brother's big day.

749
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:35,040
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}也为了让王国更长久地脱离他的愚蠢统治
And to protect the realm from his idiotic rule for a while longer.

750
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:38,670
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}说来听听
I will hear you.

751
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:46,550
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我会隐藏你和你的部分士兵
I will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers,

752
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:52,230
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}带你们到奥丁的房间 然后你就能在他躺着的地方杀了他
lead you into Odin's chambers, and you can slay him where he lies.

753
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,350
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你为什么不亲手杀了他
Why not kill him yourself?

754
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:59,110
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我认为阿斯加德人不会乐意
I suspect that the Asgardians would not take kindly

755
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:01,440
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}让一个弑君者当国王
to a king who had murdered his predecessor.

756
01:10:02,610 --> 01:10:05,700
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}一旦奥丁死了 我将把宝匣还给你
Once Odin is dead, I will return the Casket to you

757
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:10,790
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你将为约顿海姆夺回所有的...
and you can return Jotunheim to all its...

758
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:15,000
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}荣耀
glory.

759
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:20,960
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}同意
Accept.

760
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,390
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你有什么烦恼吗 守门人
What troubles you, Gatekeeper?

761
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:33,640
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我注视着你在约顿海姆的一举一动 但却听不到也看不见你
I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim, but could neither see you nor hear you.

762
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:35,560
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我被你屏蔽在外了
You were shrouded from me,

763
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,810
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}就像冰巨人进入这个王国一样
like the Frost Giants that entered this realm.

764
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:41,480
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}或许是因为你工作那么多年后 感觉退化了
Perhaps your senses have weakened after your many years of service.

765
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,240
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}又或许是有人找到了
Or perhaps someone has found a way

766
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:46,410
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}隐藏他不想让我看到的东西的方法
to hide that which he does not wish me to see.

767
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,740
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你有很强的力量 海姆达尔
You have great power, Heimdall.

768
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:53,750
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}奥丁害怕过你吗
Did Odin ever fear you?

769
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,670
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}- 没有  - 为什么没有
- No.  - And why is that?

770
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,000
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}因为他是我的国王 我也发誓要听命于他
Because he is my king and I am sworn to obey him.

771
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:05,510
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}他曾经是你的国王 而你现在要发誓听命于我
He was your king and you're sworn to obey me now.

772
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:07,430
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}好吗
Yes?

773
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:14,270
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}好的
Yes.

774
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:17,690
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你不能对任何人打开彩虹桥
Then you will open the Bifrost to no one

775
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:20,610
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}直到我修复好我哥哥造成的破坏
until I have repaired the damage that my brother has done.

776
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:37,370
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}天啊 他还好吗
Oh, my God. Is he okay?

777
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,710
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}他没事 一点伤都没有
He's fine. Not injured at all.

778
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:42,130
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}对不起 朋友
I'm sorry, my friend.

779
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:44,050
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}- 发生了什么  - 我们喝醉了 打了架
- What happened?  - We drank, we fought,

780
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:45,630
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}他是他祖先的骄傲
he made his ancestors proud.

781
01:11:46,090 --> 01:11:47,930
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}把他放床上
Put him on the bed.

782
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:02,730
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我还是不相信你是雷神
I still don't think you're the God of Thunder.

783
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:05,570
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}但你应该是
But you ought to be.

784
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:18,160
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}这是你们的住所
Are these your chambers?

785
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:22,250
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}更像是临时居所
It's more of a temporary living situation.

786
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:26,920
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}对不起 我通常不会有客人
I'm sorry. I don't usually have guests.

787
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:30,430
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}事实上 我从来没有过客人
Actually, I never have guests.

788
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:34,760
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}这里不适合待客
That's not the right place for it.

789
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,430
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}对不起
I'm sorry.

790
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:41,560
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我们出去好吗
Can we go outside?

791
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:43,860
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}好 当然
Yes, of course.

792
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,660
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}有时候我睡不着就会来这里
I come up here sometimes when I can't sleep

793
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:55,870
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}或者是我想协调粒子数据的时候 又或是黛西把我逼疯的时候
or I'm trying to reconcile particle data, or when Darcy's driving me crazy.

794
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:00,460
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}这么一想 其实我经常来这里
I come up here a lot, actually, now that I think about it.

795
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:06,380
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我真的很高兴你安全了
I'm really glad you're safe.

796
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:09,970
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你已经对我很好了
You've been very kind to me,

797
01:13:10,670 --> 01:13:12,890
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我对你表达的感谢却远远不够
and I've been far less grateful than you deserve.

798
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:14,760
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我用我的车撞了你很多次
Well, I hit you with my car a couple times,

799
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:16,890
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}所以我们大概扯平了
so I think that kind of evens things out.

800
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:21,140
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}也许是我自找的呢
Perhaps I had it coming.

801
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:28,320
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}天啊
Oh, my God!

802
01:13:29,570 --> 01:13:30,900
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}难以置信
I don't believe it!

803
01:13:31,150 --> 01:13:34,570
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我只带回了它 对不起 这远少于我承诺给你的
It was all I could get back. I'm sorry it's not as much as I promised.

804
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:39,330
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}不不 这很好了 这... 现在我不必从头开始了
No, no, this is great! This is... I don't have to start from scratch now.

805
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:41,000
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}谢谢
Thank you.

806
01:13:45,670 --> 01:13:47,090
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}怎么了
What's wrong?

807
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,500
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}神盾局
S.H.I.E.L.D.

808
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:50,920
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}不论他们是谁
Whatever they are,

809
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:54,050
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}他们会动用他们的权力做任何事情
they're gonna do everything in their power

810
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:56,850
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}以此来保证这项研究永远不会公诸于众
to make sure this research never sees the light of day.

811
01:13:57,010 --> 01:13:58,350
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}不会的 简
No, Jane.

812
01:13:58,930 --> 01:14:00,850
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}听我说 你一定不要放弃
Listen to me. You must not give up.

813
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:03,100
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}- 你一定要完成你已经开始的研究  - 为什么
- You must finish what you've started.  - Why?

814
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:04,940
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}因为你是对的
Because you're right.

815
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:06,770
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}看看这里
Here, look.

816
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:12,860
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你的祖先们称之为魔幻 而你当它是科学
Your ancestors called it magic, and you call it science.

817
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:16,200
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我来自一个将二者视为等同的地方
Well, I come from a place where they're one and the same thing.

818
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,380
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}那是什么
What is that?

819
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:36,510
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我父亲是这么跟我解释的
My father explained it to me like this,

820
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:38,350
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你的世界
that your world

821
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:41,260
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}是宇宙九界之一
is one of the Nine Realms of the Cosmos,

822
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:44,350
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}它们通过尤克特拉希尔的树枝彼此相连
linked to each other by the branches of Yggdrasil,

823
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:46,650
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}也就是世界之树
the Worlds Tree.

824
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:49,560
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你每天都能看到却不自知
Now you see it every day without realising.

825
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:52,900
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}影像通过... 你们叫它什么

To hell with treason, it's suicide.

847

854
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:43,510
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}宁可犯下叛国罪也要把索尔带回来

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}我必须效忠于国王 所以不能开启那座桥
I am bound by honour to our king. I cannot open the bridge to you.

858

Complicated fellow, isn't he?

- What the hell was that?  - I don't know, sir.

862

You can't stop it.

1016
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,340

Why have you done this?

1019

And I will be true heir to the throne!

1023

You can't kill an entire race!

And what is this newfound love for the Frost Giants?

1026
01:36:10,590 --> 01:36:14,010
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}换做你 赤手空拳也能把他们消灭掉
You could have killed them all with your bare hands.

1027
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:16,180
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}- 我变了  - 我也是
- I've changed.  - So have I.

1028

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}来与我一战
Now fight me.

1029

I never wanted the throne!

1030

I never was.

1034

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}洛基 你疯了
Loki, this is madness.

Is it?

1038

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}得了吧 地球上发生了什么把你变得这么软弱
Come on. What happened to you on Earth that turned you so soft?

1039

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}不要跟我说是那个女人
Don't tell me it was that woman.

1040

It was!

1041

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}现在又有什么用呢
and what good does it do you now?

1049

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}听见了吗 哥哥 你已无能为力
Do you hear me, Brother? There's nothing you can do!

1050

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}你在做什么
What are you doing?

1051
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:30,540
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}如果你毁灭了这座桥 你将永远也见不到她
If you destroy the bridge, you'll never see her again!

1052

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}原谅我 简
Forgive me, Jane.

1053

I could have done it, Father!

{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}为我们所有人
For all of us!

1057
01:40:31,310 --> 01:40:32,650
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}不 洛基
No, Loki.

1062

And then, with a mighty bellow,

1063

I flew into the giant metal creature and laid him low!

1064
01:42:28,810 --> 01:42:32,390
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}这是摔到屁股的另一种说法吗
Is that another way of saying you fell on your huge ass?

1065
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:38,480
{\fn微软雅黑\fs16\4a&H50&\b0}事实上 摔倒是个策略 让毁灭者停下来...
As a matter of fact, falling was a tactic lulling the Destroyer...

1066
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:55,500

1078
