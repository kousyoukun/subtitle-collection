曾经
Once,

46
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,150
人类接受了一个简单的真相
mankind accepted a simple truth,

47
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,220
在这个宇宙里  他们并不孤独
that they were not alone in this universe.

48
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,320
有些地方是他们心中神的家园
Some worlds man believed to be home to their gods.

49
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,940
另一些地方  他们则心存畏惧
Others, they knew to fear.

50
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,390
在一个寒冷黑暗的国度  有一群冰霜巨人
From a realm of cold and darkness came the Frost Giants,

51
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,810
他们威胁要将人类世界带入新的冰河世纪
threatening to plunge the mortal world into a new ice age.

52
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:31,910
不过人类不必独自面对这个威胁
But humanity would not face this threat alone.

53
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,040
我们的军队将冰霜巨人
Our armies drove the Frost Giants

54
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,630
打回了自己的老窝
back into the heart of their own world.

55
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,530
损失非常惨重
The cost was great.

56
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,890
最后
In the end,

57
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,870
他们的国王倒下了
their king fell.

58
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,970
他们的能量之源也被带走了
And the source of their power was taken from them.

我们离开其它世界  回到了家园
we withdrew from the other worlds and returned home

61
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,830
永恒之国

阿斯加德
Asgard.

63
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,340
在这里  我们是希望的灯塔
Here we remain as a beacon of hope,

64
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,850
在星际间普撒光辉
shining out across the stars.

65
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:27,050
虽然我们成为了人类的神话和传说
And though we have fallen into man's myths and legends,

66
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,300
但其实是阿斯加德
it was Asgard

67
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,870
和它的战士们
and its warriors

68
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,120
为宇宙
that brought peace

69
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,090
带来了和平
to the universe.

70
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,190
不过  那一天终会来的
But the day will come

71
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,190
到时候  你们中的一个
when one of you

72
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,500
必须保卫这和平
will have to defend that peace.

73
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,170
冰霜巨人依然活着吗
Do the Frost Giants still live?

74
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,690
等我当了王
When I'm king,

75
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,270
我会追捕怪兽  把它们都杀光
I'll hunt the monsters down and slay them all!

76
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,240
就像您做的一样  父王
Just as you did, Father.

77
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,070
一位明君
A wise king

78
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:05,620
从不挑起战争  但是...
never seeks out war. But

79
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,630
他必须时刻准备好应对战争
he must always be ready for it.

80
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,960
-我准备好了  父王  -我也是
- I'm ready, Father. - So am I.

81
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,090
你们中只有一个能登上王位
Only one of you can ascend to the throne.

82
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,690
但你们两个  都是生而为王的
But both of you were born to be kings.

83
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,380
拜托
Oh, please.

84

我的长子
my firstborn.

88
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,690
强大的雷神之锤被托付给你已久
So long entrusted with the mighty hammer Mjolnir,

89
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,370
此锤由濒死恒星的内核锻造而成
forged in the heart of a dying star,

90
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,260
威力无可匹敌
its power has no equal,

91
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,780
它是用以毁灭的武器
as a weapon to destroy

92
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,700
亦可成为建造的工具
or as a tool to build.

93
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,160
与国王的身份相匹配
'Tis a fit companion for a king.

94
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,230
我从时间开始之初
I have defended Asgard

95
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,240
就保卫着阿斯加德
and the lives of the innocent across the Nine Realms

96
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,060
以及九大王国的无辜生灵
from the time of the great beginning.

97
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,900
不过这一天已经来到了
Though the day has come...

98
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,190
你是否发誓保卫九大王国
Do you swear to guard the Nine Realms?

99
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,550
我发誓
I swear.

100
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,170
你是否发誓维护和平
And do you swear to preserve the peace?

101
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,330
我发誓
I swear.

102
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,240
你是否发誓
Do you swear

103
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:21,360
摒弃一切私图野心 
to cast aside all selfish ambition

104
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,090
只为王国做有益之事
and to pledge yourself only to the good of the Realms?

105
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,400
我发誓
I swear!

106
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,010
那么  今天
Then, on this day,

107
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,610
我  众神之父奥丁
I, Odin Allfather,

108
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,480
宣布你
proclaim you...

109
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,560
冰霜巨人
The Frost Giants!

110
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,040
约顿巨人必须为他们的所作所为付出代价
The Jotuns must pay for what they've done!

111
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,300
他们已经付出了生命代价
They have paid, with their lives.

112
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,460
毁灭者履行了自己的职责
The Destroyer did its work,

113
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,240
远古冬棺是安全的  一切都好
the Casket is safe, and all is well.

114
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,260
一切都好
All is well?

115
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,680
他们攻进了武器库
They broke into the weapons vault!

116
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,470
倘若冰霜巨人偷走了任何一件圣物
If the Frost Giants had stolen even one of these relics...

117
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,070
-他们并没有  -我想知道为什么
- They didn't. - Well, I want to know why!

118
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,890
我和约顿之王劳菲有休战协定
I have a truce with Laufey, King of the Jotuns.

119
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,820
他刚刚打破了休战
He just broke your truce!

120
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:03,040
他们知道你是有弱点的
They know you are vulnerable!

121
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,300
你准备采取什么行动
What action would you take?

122
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,590
像您曾经一样  进军约顿海姆
March into Jotunheim as you once did.

123
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,190
给他们一个教训
Teach them a lesson.

124
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,180
让他们吓破胆
Break their spirits

125
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,640
这样他们就再不敢来进犯了
so they'll never dare try to cross our borders again.

126
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,950
你只是站在一个战士的角度思考
You're thinking only as a warrior.

127
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,170
这就是战争行为
This was an act of war!

128
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,620
这只是一小部分人  注定失败的行为
It was the act of but a few, doomed to fail.

129
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,120
看看他们都到哪了
Look how far they got!

130
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,810
我们会找到防御漏洞并修补好的
We will find the breach in our defenses and it will be sealed.

131
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,170
作为阿斯加德的王
As King of Asgard...

132
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,990
但你不是王
But you're not king!

133
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,070
现在还不是
Not yet.

134
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,830
现在来陪我可不明智  弟弟
It's unwise to be in my company right now, brother.

135
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,650
这本该是我的荣耀之日
This was to be my day of triumph.

136
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,300
那一天会来的
It'll come.

137
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,830
迟早会来的
In time.

138
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,290
这是怎么了
What's this?

139
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,140
如果这么说能安慰你的话  
If it's any consolation,

140
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,470
我觉得你是对的
I think you're right.

141
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,130
关于冰霜巨人  关于劳菲  关于一切
About the Frost Giants, about Laufey, about everything.

142
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,940
如果他们能突破阿斯加德的防御一次
If they found a way to penetrate Asgard's defenses once,

143
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,620
谁能保证他们不会卷土重来呢
who's to say they won't try again?

144
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,590
-下一次会带着军队来  -正是
- Next time with an army. - Exactly.

145
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,720
但你的任何行动  都会违背父王的意愿
There's nothing you can do without defying Father.

146
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,240
不不不  我了解这表情
No, no, no. I know that look.

147
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,690
这是确保我们防御安全的唯一方法
That's the only way to ensure the safety of our borders.

148
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,180
托尔  这是发疯
Thor, it's madness.

149
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,470
发疯  哪种程度的发疯
Madness? What sort of madness?

150
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,090
我们要去约顿海姆
We're going to Jotunheim.

151
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,820
什么
What?

152
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,990
这可不像去趟地球
This isn't like a journey to Earth

153
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,010
在那里你只要稍稍召唤些闪电雷鸣
where you summon a little lightning and thunder,

154
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,100
人类就会把你当成神来崇拜
and the mortals worship you as a god.

155
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,110
这可是约顿海姆
This is Jotunheim.

156
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,710
我父王曾一路攻入约顿海姆
My father fought his way into Jotunheim,

157
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,850
击败了他们的军队  带走了他们的远古冬棺
defeated their armies and took their Casket.

158
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,370
我们只是去寻求回应
We would just be looking for answers.

159
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,040
这是被禁止的
It is forbidden!

160
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,120
朋友们  你们忘了我们一起做过的事吗
My friends, have you forgotten all that we have done together?

161
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,280
范达尔  霍根
Fandral, Hogun.

162
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,390
是谁带你们加入了最光荣的战役
Who led you into the most glorious of battles?

163
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,800
是你
You did.

164
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,510
沃斯塔格  是谁给了你鲜美的佳肴
And Volstagg, to delicacies so succulent,

165
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,050
让你觉得欲仙欲死  仿佛升入了英灵殿呢
you thought you'd died and gone to Valhalla?

166
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:27,580
是你
You did.

167
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,460
没错
Yes!

168
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,640
又是谁向所有认为
And who proved wrong all who scoffed at the idea

169
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,240
少女不能成为王国最威猛的战士的人
that a young maiden could be one of the fiercest warriors

170
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,590
证明了他们的错误呢
this realm has ever known?

171
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,650
是我
I did.

172
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,800
的确  但我一直支持你  希芙
True, but I supported you, Sif.

173
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,340
朋友们
My friends,

174
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,090
我们要去约顿海姆
we're going to Jotunheim.

175
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:34,950
交给我吧
You leave this to me.

176
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,880
-好海姆达尔...  -你们穿得不够暖
- Good Heimdall... - You're not dressed warmly enough.

177
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,360
你说什么
I'm sorry?

178
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,320
你们以为能瞒过我吗
Do you think that you can deceive me?

179
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,580
-你一定是搞错了  -够了
- You must be mistaken... - Enough!

180
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,820
海姆达尔  能让我们过去吗
Heimdall, may we pass?

181
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:56,800
从没有敌人能逃过我的眼睛  直到今天
Never has an enemy slipped my watch until this day.

182
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,780
我想知道究竟是怎么回事
I wish to know how that happened.

183
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,100
那就在我们回来之前
Then tell no one where we have gone

184
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,510
别告诉任何人我们的去向
until we've returned.

185
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,550
明白了吗
Understand?

186
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,560
怎么了  三寸不烂之舌打结了
What happened? Silver tongue turn to lead?

187
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,510
我警告你们
Be warned.

188
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,400
作为门卫
I will honor my sworn oath

189
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:03,570
我将遵守保护王国的誓言
to protect this realm as its Gatekeeper.

190
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,390
如果你们的归来威胁了阿斯加德的安全
If your return threatens the safety of Asgard,

191
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,070
彩虹桥将不会为你们开启
Bifrost will remain closed to you

192
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,550
你将被留在约顿海姆的寒冷荒漠中等死
and you'll be left to die in the cold waste of Jotunheim.

193
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,580
你不能干脆为我们一直开着桥吗
Couldn't you just leave the bridge open for us?

194
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,820
一直开启
To leave the bridge open

195
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:18,040
会释放彩虹桥的全部能量
would unleash the full power of the Bifrost

196
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,620
摧毁连你们在内的整个约顿海姆
and destroy Jotunheim with you upon it.

197
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,670
我可不准备今天死
I have no plans to die today.

198
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,790
没人想死
None do.

199
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,880
我们不该来的
We shouldn't be here.

200
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,130
走吧
Let's move.

201
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,760
他们在哪
Where are they?

202
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,070
躲起来了
Hiding,

203
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,240
懦夫的惯用伎俩
as cowards always do.

204
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:34,780
你们这么大老远来送死  阿斯加德人
You've come a long way to die, Asgardians.

205
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,880
我是托尔·奥丁森
I am Thor Odinson!

206
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,510
我们知道你是谁
We know who you are.

207
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,230
你们的人是怎么进入阿斯加德的
How did your people get into Asgard?

208
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,590
奥丁之家满是叛徒
The House of Odin is full of traitors.

209
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,640
不要用谎言污蔑我父王之名
Do not dishonor my father's name with your lies!

210
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,860
你父亲是个刽子手  是个小偷
Your father is a murderer and a thief!

211
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,430
你们又为什么而来  来讲和吗
And why have you come here? To make peace?

212
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,200
你期待战争  你渴望它
You long for battle. You crave it.

213
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,260
你不过是个
You're nothing but a boy

214
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,140
想证明自己是大人的小男孩
trying to prove himself a man.

215
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:19,250
本"男孩"厌倦了你的嘲笑
Well, this "boy" has grown tired of your mockery.

216
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:28,140
托尔  三思而后行
Thor, stop and think.

217
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,760
看看你周围  我们寡不敌众
Look around you, we're outnumbered.

218
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,450
记住你的位置  弟弟
Know your place, brother.

219
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,090
你不知道自己的行为将导致什么
You know not what your actions would unleash.

220
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,060
可我知道
I do.

221
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,980
走吧  趁我还没改主意
Go now, while I still allow it.

222
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,500
我们将接受您最宽仁的提议
We will accept your most gracious offer.

223
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,820
走吧  哥哥
Come on, brother.

224
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,020
滚回家吧  小公主
Run back home, little princess.

225
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,460
该死
Damn.

226
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:27,910
谁是下一个
Next?

227
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,580
至少给我点挑战嘛
At least make it a challenge for me!

228
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,710
这才像样
That's more like it.

229
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,850
别让他们碰到你
Don't let them touch you!

230
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,550
托尔
Thor!

231
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,330
-我们必须走了  -那就走吧
- We must go! - Then go!

232
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,130
快跑
Run!

233
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,050
托尔
Thor!

234
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,330
海姆达尔
Heimdall!

235
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,130
开启彩虹桥
Open the bridge!

236
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,860
父王  我们一起消灭他们
Father! We'll finish them together!

237
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:22,970
闭嘴
Silence!

238
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,570
众神之父
Allfather.

239
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,300
你看上去很疲惫
You look weary.

240
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,850
劳菲
Laufey,

241
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,660
就此打住吧
end this now.

242
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,350
是你儿子挑起的
Your boy sought this out.

243
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,110
没错
You're right.

244
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:48,360
这不过是男孩的胡闹  别小题大作
And these are the actions of a boy, treat them as such.

245
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,330
你我可以就此做个了结
You and I can end this here and now,

246
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,140
不要引发进一步的杀戮
before there's further bloodshed.

247
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:56,500
事情已经超出外交范围了  众神之父
We are beyond diplomacy now, Allfather.

248
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,390
他会得到他想要的
He'll get what he came for.

249
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,990
战争
War

250
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,560
还有死亡
and death.

251
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,440
那好吧
So be it.

252
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,630
为什么把我们带回来
Why did you bring us back?

253
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,070
你知道自己做了什么  挑起了什么吗
Do you realize what you've done? What you've started?

254
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,410
我在保卫我的家园
I was protecting my home.

255
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,180
你连自己的朋友都保护不了
You cannot even protect your friends!

256
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,900
又凭什么保护这个王国
How can you hope to protect a kingdom?

257
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,920
带他去疗伤  立刻
Get him to the healing room! Now!

258
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,730
如果惧怕行动  王国就要灭亡了  
There won't be a kingdom to protect

259
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,230
还保卫什么
if you're afraid to act.

260
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,560
约顿巨人必须像曾经惧怕你一样学着惧怕我
The Jotuns must learn to fear me, just as they once feared you.

261
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,060
这是骄傲和自负  不是领导能力
That's pride and vanity talking, not leadership.

262
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,770
你忘了我教过你的一切
You've forgotten everything I taught you

263
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,030
战士的耐心
about a warrior's patience.

264
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,890
就在你等待和忍耐的时候  
While you wait and be patient,

265
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,190
九大王国都在嘲笑我们
the Nine Realms laugh at us.

266
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,270
老路走不通了
The old ways are done.

267
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,200
你眼见阿斯加德衰落  却只会夸夸其谈
You'd stand giving speeches while Asgard falls.

268
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:05,820
你是个虚荣  贪婪  残暴的孩子
You are a vain, greedy, cruel boy!

269
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:08,850
你是个愚蠢的老头
And you are an old man and a fool!

270
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,430
是啊
Yes.

271
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,850
我是愚蠢的
I was a fool

272
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,820
以为你已经准备好了
to think you were ready.

273
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,060
父王
Father...

274
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,650
托尔·奥丁森
Thor Odinson,

275
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,760
你违抗了国王的明确指令
you have betrayed the express command of your king.

276
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,450
由于你的傲慢和愚蠢
Through your arrogance and stupidity,

277
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,430
和平的王国和无辜的生灵
you've opened these peaceful realms and innocent lives

278
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:44,550
将面临战争的恐怖和惨景
to the horror and desolation of war!

279
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:54,370
你愧对这些王国
You are unworthy of these realms!

280
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,590
愧对你的头衔
You're unworthy of your title!

281
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,700
你愧对
You're unworthy

282
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:05,480
你所背叛的爱你之人
of the loved ones you have betrayed.

283
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,990
现在  我要收回你的能力
I now take from you your power!

284
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,160
以我父亲
In the name of my father

285
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,470
及祖父的名义
and his father before,

286
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,320
我  众神之父奥丁  将你驱逐
I, Odin Allfather, cast you out!

287
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,860
不管是谁持有此锤  只要他配得上
Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy,

288
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,980
就将拥有雷神之力
shall possess the power of Thor.

289
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,530
法律上讲  是你的错
I think that was legally your fault.

290
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,080
去拿急救箱
Get the first aid kit.

291
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,820
帮帮忙  千万别死
Do me a favor and don't be dead.

292
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,220
需要做心肺复苏吗  
Does he need CPR?

293
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,030
我可会做心肺复苏了
Because I totally know CPR.

294
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,080
他从哪来的
Where did he come from?

295
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,010
你还好吗
You all right?

296
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,220
锤子
Hammer?

297
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,350
锤子
Hammer?

298
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,380
我们看得出你喝高了  挺明显的
Yeah, we can tell you're hammered. It's pretty obvious.

299
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,650
上帝啊  艾瑞克  看看这个
Oh, my God. Erik, look at this!

300
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,280
我们得在一切变化之前赶快行动
We have to move quickly before this all changes.

301
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,600
简  我们得送他去医院
Jane, we have to take him to the hospital.

302
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,910
-父王  -他好着呢  看看他
- Father! - He's fine, look at him.

303
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,110
海姆达尔 
Heimdall!

304
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,000
我知道你能听见我  开启彩虹桥
I know you can hear me! Open the Bifrost!

305
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,990
医院  你去  我留下
Hospital. You go, I'll stay.

306
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:01,150
你  这是哪个王国
You. What realm is this?

307
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:03,270
艾尔夫海姆  诺恩海姆
Alfheim? Nornheim?

308
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,520
新墨西哥
New Mexico?

309
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:08,610
你胆敢用这么小的武器威胁我  托尔
You dare threaten me, Thor, with so puny a weapon?

310
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,930
咋了  他吓着我了
What? He was freaking me out!

311
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,580
下次你要电击一个人的话
Next time you decide to taser somebody,

312
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,910
确保他已经在车里了   好吗
make sure he's already in the car, okay?

313
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,240
简  走吧
Jane! Come on.

314
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:40,110
县医院

315
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,090
姓名
Name?

316
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,940
他说他叫托尔
He said it was Thor?

317
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:47,560
托  尔
T-h-o-r.

318
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,340
你和他什么关系
And your relationship to him?

319
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,550
根本不认识
I've never met him before.

320
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,040
直到她开车撞倒了他
Until she hit him with a car.

321
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:55,240
只是擦到了他  但她把他电晕了
I grazed him, but she tasered him.

322
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,420
没错
Yes, I did.

323
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,970
只是抽点血
Just taking a little blood.

324
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,970
你胆敢袭击奥丁之子
How dare you attack the son of Odin?

325
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,190
快来帮忙
I need some help!

326
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,340
叫保安来
Call security!

327
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,870
保安速到三号急诊室  马上
Security to ER 3, stat!

328
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,240
你们打不过伟大的...
You're no match for the Mighty...

329
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,210
旧桥市市界

330
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,440
你说这不是单纯的磁暴吧
You don't think this was just a magnetic storm, do you?

331
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:34,430
看  边缘处的透镜作用
Look, the lensing around these edges

332
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,210
是爱因斯坦-罗森桥的特征
is characteristic of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

333
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,200
什么桥
A what?

334
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,280
-你不是科学专业的吗  -政治科学
- I thought you were a science major? - Political science.

335
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,970
她是唯一的申请人
She was the only applicant.

336
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:45,000
爱因斯坦-罗森桥是可能存在的
An Einstein-Rosen Bridge is a theoretical connection

337
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,330
两个不同时空的连接带
between two different points of space-time.

338
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,390
就是个虫洞
It's a wormhole.

339
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,870
-艾瑞克  你看到了什么  -星星
- Erik, look. What do you see? - Stars.

340
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,910
对  但不是我们的星星
Yeah, but not our stars.

341
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,690
看  这是我们这象限
See, this is the star alignment

342
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,550
每年这时候的星体排布
for our quadrant this time of year,

343
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,090
除非小熊星座休假了
and unless Ursa Minor decided to take a day off,

344
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,260
否则这就是别处的星座
these are someone else's constellations.

345
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,670
快看这个
Check this out.

346
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,400
不  不可能
No, it can't be.

347
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,660
我想我有东西落在医院了
I think I left something at the hospital.

348
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,150
这不可能
It's not possible!

349
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:48,010
县医院

350
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:51,420
不知他是吸毒还是怎么的  突然就发飙
He was on drugs or something. He just went nuts.

351
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,770
天啊
Oh, my God.

352
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,800
我刚把一件最重要的证据弄丢了
I just lost my most important piece of evidence.

353
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:07,720
又这样
Typical.

354
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,910
-现在怎么办  -找到他
- So now what? - We find him.

355
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,600
你看到他在医院都干了什么吗
Did you see what he did in there?

356
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,360
去找他未必是个好主意
I'm not sure finding him is the best idea.

357
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:14,530
我们的数据无法说明
Well, our data can't tell us

358
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,870
处于磁暴之中是什么感觉
what it was like to be inside that event,

359
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,930
但他能  所以我们得找到他
and he can. So, we're gonna find him.

360
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,760
好吧
Okay.

361
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,810
看来得找遍整个新墨西哥了  对吧
So we're gonna look all over New Mexico, right?

362
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,400
没错
Exactly.

363
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,080
什么
What?

364
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,460
对不起  我发誓我不是故意老撞你的
I'm so sorry. I swear I'm not doing this on purpose.

365
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,810
我来  我来
I got it, I got it.

366
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,570
加油  搞定它
Come on, kick it in now!

367
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,680
拔起来了吗
Did it work?

368
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,510
长官  我们找到了
Sir, we found it.

369
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:48,050
作为一个疯子流浪汉  他太正点了
You know, for a crazy homeless person, he's pretty cut.

370
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,820
抱歉我电了你
Hey, sorry I tased you!

371
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,550
别动  别动
Excuse me, excuse me!

372
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
这是什么
What is this?

373
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:08,940
你好  我的名字叫唐纳德·布莱克医生

374
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,220
我前男友的
My ex.

375
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,970
很会和病人相处  却不会跟我相处
Good with patients and bad with relationships.

376
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,540
只有这衣服合你身了
They're the only clothes I had that would fit you.

377
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,850
足矣
They will suffice.

378
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:20,810
不用客气
You're welcome.

379
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,970
这具人类躯体变弱了
This mortal form has grown weak.

380
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,530
我需要进食
I need sustenance.

381
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,470
我们不该让他去的
We should never have let him go.

382
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:47,150
没人能阻止他
There was no stopping him.

383
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,420
他只是被放逐了  又不是死了
Well, at least he's only banished, not dead.

384
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,420
要不是守护
Which is what we'd all be

385
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,940
把我们的去向告诉了奥丁  我们可就没命了
if that guard hadn't told Odin where we'd gone.

386
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,240
守护是怎么知道的
How did the guard even know?

387
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,830
我告诉他的
I told him.

388
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,480
什么
What?

389
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,120
我叫他在我们走后把这事告诉奥丁
I told him to go to Odin after we'd left.

390
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:09,620
他动作太慢了  该挨顿鞭子
He should be flogged for taking so long.

391
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,980
我们本该在到约顿海姆前被拦下
We should never have reached Jotunheim.

392
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,210
是你告诉守护的
You told the guard?

393
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,510
我救了我们的命
I saved our lives.

394
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,500
还有托尔的
And Thor's.

395
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,120
我压根没想到父王会因此放逐他
I had no idea Father would banish him for what he did.

396
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,940
洛基
Loki.

397
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,800
你得去找众神之父
You must go to the Allfather

398
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:24,590
劝他收回成命
and convince him to change his mind.

399
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,370
我去了又能如何
And if I do, then what?

400
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,340
我比你们都更爱托尔
I love Thor more dearly than any of you,

401
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,660
但你们知道他是怎样的人
but you know what he is.

402
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,240
高傲  鲁莽  极其危险
He's arrogant. He's reckless. He's dangerous.

403
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,070
你们看到他今天的所作所为了
You saw how he was today.

404
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,850
这是阿斯加德的国王该有的样子吗
Is that what Asgard needs from its king?

405
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,130
他嘴上说是为了阿斯加德好
He may speak of the good of Asgard,

406
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,560
但他一直嫉妒托尔
but he's always been jealous of Thor.

407
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,450
我们得感谢他
We should be grateful to him,

408
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,700
是他救了我们的命
he saved our lives.

409
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,190
劳菲曾说
Laufey said

410
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,670
奥丁之家里有叛徒
there were traitors in the House of Odin.

411
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:59,590
魔法大师有能力将三个约顿巨人带进阿斯加德
A master of magic could bring three Jotuns into Asgard.

412
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:02,880
洛基一向喜欢恶作剧
Loki's always been one for mischief,

413
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:05,250
但你说的可是相当严重的事
but you're talking about something else entirely.

414
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:27,120
放下
Stop!

415
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,270
我被诅咒了吗
Am I cursed?

416
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,850
没有
No.

417
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,350
我到底是什么人
What am I?

418
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:41,660
你是我儿子
You're my son.

419
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,830
此外呢
What more than that?

420
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,730
远古冬棺并不是
The Casket wasn't the

421
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:03,030
你那天从约顿海姆夺来的唯一东西吧
only thing you took from Jotunheim that day, was it?

422
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,420
没错
No.

423
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:13,680
战后
In the aftermath of the battle,

424
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:17,010
我走进神殿  发现了一个婴儿
I went into the temple and I found a baby.

425
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,240
巨人族的幼小后代
Small for a giant's offspring.

426
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:27,870
被遗弃  很痛苦  等着自生自灭
Abandoned, suffering, left to die.

427
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,800
是劳菲的儿子
Laufey's son.

428
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,210
劳菲的儿子
Laufey's son.

429
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,180
没错
Yes.

430
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,130
为什么
Why?

431
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,840
你杀约顿巨人无数  为何要带我走
You were knee-deep in Jotuns blood, why would you take me?

432
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:48,350
你只是无辜的孩子
You were an innocent child.

433
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:52,600
不  你带走我另有目的  是什么
No. You took me for a purpose. What was it?

434
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,940
告诉我
Tell me!

435
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,930
我希望有朝一日两族能联合
I thought we could unite our kingdoms one day.

436
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,340
形成同盟  带来永久和平
Bring about an alliance, bring about permanent peace.

437
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,460
通过你
Through you.

438
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,890
什么
What?

439
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,890
但那一切都无关紧要了
But those plans no longer matter.

440
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,110
这么说  我不过是又一件被盗纪念品
So I am no more than another stolen relic,

441
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:19,760
被困在此  等着某天派上用场
locked up here until you might have use of me.

442
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:20,950
你为什么要曲解我的意思
Why do you twist my words?

443
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,210
你本可从一开始就告诉我我的身份
You could have told me what I was from the beginning,

444
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,570
你为什么没说
why didn't you?

445
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,720
你是我儿子
You're my son.

446
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:29,010
我只是想保护你  不被真相伤害
I wanted only to protect you from the truth.

447
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:29,730
怎么
What?

448
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,540
因为我是孩子们睡前
Because I'm the monster

449
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:34,100
父母用来吓唬他们的怪兽吗
parents tell their children about at night?

450
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,090
-不是的  -现在一切都说得通了
- No, no. - You know, it all makes sense now!

451
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,820
为什么多年来你一直偏爱托尔
Why you favored Thor all these years!

452
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:42,330
因为无论你怎么说你爱我
Because no matter how much you claim to love me,

453
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,750
你绝不会让冰霜巨人
you could never have a Frost Giant

454
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,560
坐上阿斯加德的王座
sitting on the throne of Asgard!

455
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,820
卫兵
Guards!

456
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,610
卫兵  快点  帮帮我
Guards, please, help!

457
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,720
你是怎么到那片云里去的
How'd you get inside that cloud?

458
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:20,190
还有  你怎么能吃了一整盒糕点
Also, how could you eat an entire box of Pop-Tarts

459
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,860
还饿成这样
and still be this hungry?

460
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,050
这饮料  我喜欢
This drink, I like it.

461
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:29,920
是啊  很不错吧
I know. It's great, right?

462
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:30,900
再来
Another!

463
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:34,880
对不起  伊奇  小意外
Sorry, Lzzy. Little accident.

464
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,800
-你什么意思  -很美味  我还想来一杯
- What was that? - It was delicious. I want another.

465
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,900
-你可以直接说啊  -我说了啊
- Well, you could have just said so. - I just did.

466
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,990
不  好好说
No, I mean, ask nicely.

467
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,160
我没有失礼之意啊
I meant no disrespect.

468
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:47,080
好吧  别再砸东西了
All right. Well, no more smashing.

469
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,310
行吗
Deal?

470
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:51,950
我保证
You have my word.

471
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:54,120
很好
Good.

472
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,300
还要那些  伊奇
The usual, please, Lzzy.

473
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,440
你错过了陨石坑那边的精彩时刻
You missed all the excitement out at the crater.

474
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:03,410
他们说有个卫星掉在沙漠里了
They're saying some kind of satellite landed out in the desert.

475
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,170
我们本来玩得很开心
Yeah, we were having a good time with it

476
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,640
后来政府的人来了
until the Feds showed up.

477
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:10,110
打扰一下  你们是说有个卫星坠落了吗
Excuse me. Did you say there was a satellite crash?

478
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,030
是的
Yeah.

479
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:14,230
天啊  这个得传到脸书上  笑一个
Oh, my God. This is going on Facebook. Smile.

480
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,340
那卫星长什么样
What did it look like, the satellite?

481
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:22,500
不知道是不是卫星  只知道很重
I don't know anything about satellites, but it was heavy.

482
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,310
没人能拿得起它
I mean, nobody could lift it.

483
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:29,440
他们说它有辐射  我还碰过呢
They said it was radioactive. I had my hands all over it.

484
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:30,380
怎么走
Which way?

485
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,500
从这往西50英里
Fifty miles west of here.

486
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:36,850
劝你别去浪费时间
Well, I wouldn't waste my time!

487
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:38,940
我们走时似乎全军都出动了
Looked like the whole Army was coming when we left.

488
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:44,860
蠢蛋
Dumbass!

489
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:47,640
你要去哪里
Where are you going?

490
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,120
-西行50英里处  -为什么
- Fifty miles west of here. - Why?

491
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,600
去拿回属于我的东西
To get what belongs to me.

492
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:53,330
这么说那卫星成你的了
So you own a satellite now?

493
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,600
它不是他们说的那东西
It's not what they say it is.

494
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:55,320
不管它是什么
Well, whatever it is,

495
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:57,510
看来已经被政府控制了
the government seems to think it's theirs. So,

496
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,160
你就打算直冲过去抢回来吗
you just intend to go in there and take it?

497
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,040
是的
Yes.

498
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,930
如果你现在带我去那儿
If you take me there now,

499
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,880
我就告诉你  你想知道的一切
I'll tell you everything you wish to know.

500
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:06,210
-一切  -没错
- Everything? - Yes.

501
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:07,600
等我拿回雷神之锤  你就能得到
All the answers you seek will be yours

502
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:09,080
你寻求的答案
once I reclaim Mjolnir.

503
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:11,300
咩咩  咩咩是什么
Myeu-muh? What's Myeu-muh?

504
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:12,710
能跟你说句话吗  简
Can I have a word, Jane?

505
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,430
请别这么做
Please don't do this.

506
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,040
你昨晚不也看到了吗
You saw what I saw last night.

507
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:21,890
这不是巧合
This is no coincidence.

508
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,500
我们得查明陨石坑里有什么
We have to find out what's in that crater.

509
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,360
我不是在说陨石坑  我在说他
But I'm not talking about the crater, I'm talking about him.

510
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:28,180
-但他答应告诉我们真相  -他是疯子
- But he's promising us the answers. - He's delusional.

511
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:29,460
听听他都在说什么
Listen to what he's saying.

512
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:31,050
他说什么雷神之锤
He's talking about Mjolnir

513
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,800
托尔  彩虹桥
and Thor and Bifrost.

514
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,930
这是我从小听到大的神话
It's the stories I grew up with as a child.

515
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,930
我只是送他去  就这样
I'm just going to drive him. That's it.

516
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,900
他很危险  简
He's dangerous, Jane.

517
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:50,030
很抱歉  我不能送你去了
I'm sorry, but I can't take you.

518
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,560
那我们就此告别吧
Then this is where we say goodbye.

519
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,060
谢谢
Thank you?

520
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:05,480
简·福斯特
Jane Foster,

521
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,330
艾瑞克·塞尔维格
Erik Selvig,

522
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:08,860
达西
Darcy,

523
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:10,680
再会
farewell.

524
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:15,700
好吧
All right.

525
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:17,630
回去干活儿了
Back to work.

526
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,010
那是我的东西
That's my stuff!

527
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:46,400
这究竟是怎么回事
What the hell is going on here?

528
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,120
福斯特小姐  我是神盾局的科尔森特工
Ms. Foster, I'm Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.

529
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:49,910
我应该知道那是什么意思吗
Is that supposed to mean something to me?

530
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:51,690
-你不能这样做  -简
- You can't do this! - Jane!

531
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,530
简  这比你想的严重多了  别管了
Jane, this is a lot more serious than you realize. Let it go.

532
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:57,010
别管  这可是我的生活
Let it go? This is my life.

533
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,100
我们在调查一项安全威胁
We're investigating a security threat.

534
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:00,070
我们得征用
We need to appropriate

535
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,820
你的记录  还有你的大气数据
your records and all your atmospheric data.

536
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:03,990
"征用"是偷的意思吗
By "appropriate," do you mean steal?

537
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:07,260
给  这足以弥补你的损失了
Here, this should more than compensate you for your trouble.

538
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:09,820
这些东西在睿侠可买不到
I can't just buy replacements at Radio Shack,

539
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:11,730
大部分设备都是我自己组装的
I made most of this equipment myself!

540
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:13,060
那你肯定能重做一次
Then I'm sure you can do it again.

541
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:16,490
我肯定也能告你侵犯我的宪法权利
And I'm sure I can sue you for violating my constitutional rights!

542
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,790
抱歉  福斯特小姐  但我们是好人
I'm sorry, Ms. Foster, but we're the good guys.

543
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,970
我们也是
So are we!

544
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:24,660
我就快弄清一件很了不起的事了
I'm on the verge of understanding something extraordinary.

545
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:26,260
而关于这现象  我所掌握的一切
And everything I know about this phenomenon

546
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:28,390
都在这实验室和这本子里了
is either in this lab or in this book.

547
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:30,260
你不能想拿就拿...
And you can't just take this away...

548
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,100
简  冷静  冷静  简...
Jane! Easy! Easy. Jane...

549
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:38,930
多谢配合
Thank you for your cooperation.

550
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,370
多年的研究
Years of research,

551
00:46:58,810 --> 00:46:59,790
全没了
gone.

552
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,420
他们还拿走了我的iPod
They even took my iPod.

553
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:05,680
-备份资料呢  -也被拿了
- What about the backups? - They took our backups.

554
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,650
他们还拿走了备份资料的备份
They took the backups of our backups.

555
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,530
他们做得非常彻底
They were extremely thorough.

556
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,870
我刚下载了三十多首歌
I just downloaded, like, 30 songs onto there.

557
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,080
你能不能别提你的iPod了
Could you please stop with your iPod?

558
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,050
这些到底是什么人啊
Who are these people?

559
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:20,760
我认识个科学家
I knew this scientist.

560
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:23,480
是伽玛辐射领域的先驱
The pioneer in gamma radiation.

561
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:24,850
后来神盾局出现了
S.H.I.E.L.D. showed up

562
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:29,390
他就杳无音信了
and he wasn't heard from again.

563
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:31,870
他们不能这样对我们
They're not gonna do that to us.

564
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:33,340
我要去把东西抢回来
I'm gonna get everything back.

565
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,250
别这样  让我先联系下我的一个同事
Come on, please. Let me contact one of my colleagues.

566
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,110
他之前和这些人接触过
He's had some dealings with these people before.

567
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,450
我给他发邮件  也许他能帮上忙
I'll e-mail him and maybe he can help.

568
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,930
你的笔记本电脑也被拿走了
They took your laptop, too.

569
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,770
众神之父  我们有急事禀报
Allfather, we must speak with you urgently.

570
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:10,620
我的朋友们
My friends.

571
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,400
奥丁呢
Where's Odin?

572
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:15,550
父王进入奥丁之眠了
Father has fallen into the Odinsleep.

573
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:15,550
进入睡眠状态进行恢复和治愈

574
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,890
母后担心他将一觉不醒
Mother fears he may never awaken again.

575
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:21,670
我们要和她谈话
We would speak with her.

576
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,790
她不肯离开父王床边半步
She has refused to leave my father's bedside.

577
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:29,720
有急事你们可以直接对我说
You can bring your urgent matter to me.

578
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:38,550
我现在是你们的王
Your king.

579
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:54,480
王上  我们恳请您结束对托尔的放逐
My King, we would ask that you end Thor's banishment.

580
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:02,900
我的首个命令不能与父王的最后命令相悖
My first command cannot be to undo the Allfather's last.

581
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:07,630
我们就要与约顿海姆开战
We're on the brink of war with Jotunheim.

582
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:11,490
人民需要看到子承父命
Our people need a sense of continuity,

583
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,590
才能在困难时期拥有安全感
in order to feel safe in these difficult times.

584
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,720
所有人必须齐心合力
All of us must stand together

585
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:19,950
为阿斯加德而战
for the good of Asgard.

586
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:23,810
是的  当然
Yes, of course.

587
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,210
很好  那你们等我下令吧
Good. Then you will wait for my word.

588
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:27,860
容我
If I may

589
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:33,670
恳请陛下再考虑下...
beg the indulgence of Your Majesty to perhaps reconsider...

590
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,670
够了
We're done!

591
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:18,610
彩虹桥

592
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,110
周四  托尔日

593
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:35,370
宠物店

594
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:40,000
我要匹马
I need a horse!

595
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,520
我们不卖马  只有狗猫鸟...
We don't have horses. Just dogs, cats, birds...

596
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:47,660
那随便给我头能骑的就好
Then give me one of those large enough to ride.

597
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:50,480
你还需要搭便车吗
Hey, you still need a lift?

598
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,520
我从未做过这样的事
I've never done anything like this before.

599
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:02,060
你做过这样的事吗
Have you ever done anything like this before?

600
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,730
经常
Many times.

601
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:06,500
不过你有这个胆量
But you're brave to do it.

602
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:08,970
他们偷走了我的毕生心血
Well, they just stole my entire life's work.

603
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,810
我已经别无可失了
I don't really have much left to lose.

604
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:13,890
但你很聪明
Yeah, but you're clever.

605
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,500
比这个王国的其他人聪明多了
Far more clever than anyone else in this realm.

606
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:20,210
"王国"  "王国"
"Realm"? "Realm"?

607
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,790
-你觉得我很奇怪  -是的
- You think me strange. - Yeah, I do.

608
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:26,270
怎么个奇怪法  是好还是坏
Good strange or bad strange?

609
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:27,960
目前我还不确定
I'm not quite sure yet.

610
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:34,580
对不起
I'm sorry.

611
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,310
但是  你是谁啊
But who are you?

612
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:44,580
说真的
Really?

613
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:49,090
你很快就会知道了
You'll see soon enough.

614
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:51,750
你答应告诉我答案的
You promised me answers.

615
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,140
你要找的是座桥
What you seek, it's a bridge.

616
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,960
爱因斯坦-罗森桥吗
Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge?

617
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:00,690
该说是彩虹桥
More like a Rainbow Bridge.

618
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,220
老天  但愿你没疯
God, I hope you're not crazy.

619
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:18,220
我真不习惯看到他这样
I never get used to seeing him like this.

620
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:22,850
他已推迟了太久  我担心...
He's put it off for so long now, that I fear...

621
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,910
这会持续多久
How long will it last?

622
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:30,470
不知道  这次不一样
I don't know. This time it's different.

623
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:32,130
我们毫无准备
We were unprepared.

624
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,440
他为什么要骗我
So why did he lie?

625
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:37,790
他对你保守秘密
He kept the truth from

626
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:40,430
是不希望你觉得自己是个异类
you so that you would never feel different.

627
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:43,140
你是我们的儿子  洛基
You are our son, Loki,

628
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,520
我们是你的家人
and we, your family.

629
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:49,130
我们不能放弃希望
We mustn't lose hope

630
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:51,620
要相信你父王一定会回到我们身边
that your father will return to us.

631
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:54,410
还有你哥哥
And your brother.

632
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,840
托尔还有什么希望
What hope is there for Thor?

633
00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:01,700
你父王做任何事都有他的用意
There's always a purpose to everything your father does.

634
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:36,040
这根本不是卫星坠毁
That's no satellite crash!

635
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:37,030
否则  他们会拖走残骸
They would have hauled the wreckage away,

636
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,050
而不是在周围搭建设施
they wouldn't have built a city around it.

637
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,240
-你会需要这个的  -什么
- You're going to need this. - What?

638
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:43,920
等等  为什么
Wait, why?

639
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,290
待在原地
Now stay here.

640
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:50,030
等我拿回雷神之锤
Once I have Mjolnir,

641
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,210
就把那些被他们抢走的东西还给你
I will return the items they've stolen from you.

642
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:53,720
好吗
Deal?

643
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,380
不  看看下面的状况
No. Look what's down there.

644
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:58,040
你觉得你能闯进去把东西夺回来
You think you're just gonna walk in,

645
00:53:58,050 --> 00:53:59,400
再大摇大摆地走出来吗
grab our stuff and walk out?

646
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:01,250
不  我会飞回来
No. I'm going to fly out.

647
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,520
长官  侦察卫星的信号几乎无法穿透云层
Sir, feed from the keyhole can barely penetrate the cloud cover.

648
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:13,360
受这东西的干扰
Tech's barely working as it is,

649
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:15,780
设备本就很难正常运行
with all the interference that thing's giving off.

650
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,050
还有架商业飞机即将飞过上空
And we've got a commercial aircraft coming right over us.

651
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:21,970
西南航空5434航班
Southwest Airlines, flight 5434.

652
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,640
跟其他航班一样  更改航线
Reroute it like all the others.

653
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:25,700
稍等
Hold a sec.

654
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:28,190
西侧围栏外有东西
We've got something outside the fence, west side.

655
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:29,750
德兰西  我是杰克逊
Delancey, Jackson.

656
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,990
西侧围栏  去检查一下
West side perimeter. Go check it out.

657
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:35,540
到了
There it is.

658
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:46,190
德兰西  杰克逊  请回话
Delancey, Jackson. Report.

659
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,780
有人员受伤  围栏遭到破坏
Agent down. We've got a perimeter breach.

660
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:13,930
我是艾瑞克·塞尔维格博士  有事请留言
You've reached Dr. Erik Selvig. Please leave me a message.

661
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:17,410
艾瑞克  是我  别担心  我很好
Hi, Erik, it's me. Don't worry, I'm fine, but

662
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,300
但如果一小时内我没联系你
just in case you don't hear from me in the next hour,

663
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:23,390
就到陨石坑来找我  好吗
just come by the crater site and try and find me, okay?

664
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,240
我正在做你不让我做的事情  对不起
I did exactly what you told me not to. I'm sorry.

665
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:27,840
非常抱歉  再见
So sorry. Bye.

666
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:33,760
B区  行动
Bravo quadrant, move!

667
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:48,450
已进入南侧通道
Entering south tunnel!

668
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,860
不行  通讯中断
Negative, negative. I have no comms.

669
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:07,730
发现目标  东侧通道
Target sighted, east tunnel!

670
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:09,520
派一个人到高处  带上枪
I need eyes up high, with a gun.

671
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:36,230
朝北去了
Moving north!

672
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:45,260
怎么了
What have we got?

673
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:46,890
那玩意发出了
There's a massive electromagnetic surge

674
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:47,920
强电磁涌
coming off that thing.

675
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:49,510
系统几乎无法承受
Systems are barely coping.

676
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,180
巴顿  请回话
Barton? Talk to me.

677
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:54,950
要我击倒他吗  长官
You want me to slow him down, sir?

678
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:58,550
还是要派更多人去被他打趴
Or are you sending in more guys for him to beat up?

679
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,890
稍后给你指令
I'll let you know.

680
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:16,040
你块头还真大
You're big.

681
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:18,440
但我打过更大的
Fought bigger.

682
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:04,530
快下令  科尔森
Better call it, Coulson,

683
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:06,740
我开始喜欢这家伙了
'cause I'm starting to root for this guy.

684
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:28,690
最后的机会  长官
Last chance, sir.

685
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,940
等等  我想看看
Wait. I want to see this.

686
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:42,580
好了  表演结束  地面部队出动
All right, show's over. Ground units, move in.

687
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:37,480
他犯了罪  他进了监狱
He committed a crime. He's in jail!

688
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:39,990
-我不能把他丢在那儿  -为什么
- I can't just leave him there! - Why?

689
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,310
你没看到我看到的一切
You didn't see what I saw!

690
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,140
快看  快看  雷神之锤
Look! Look, it's Mjolnir.

691
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:50,230
你在哪找到的
Where'd you find this?

692
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:51,340
童书区
The children's section.

693
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:53,860
我想让你明白他的故事有多蠢
I just wanted to show you how silly his story was.

694
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:55,630
可你一直谆谆教导我
But you're the one who's always pushing me

695
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,400
要探索每一个可能  每一种解释
to chase down every possibility, every alternative!

696
01:00:58,410 --> 01:01:00,590
我是让你探索科学  不是魔法
I'm talking about science, not magic!

697
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,050
魔法是我们还无法解释的科学
Well, magic's just science that we don't understand yet.

698
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:03,980
亚瑟·C·克拉克的名言
Arthur C. Clarke.

699
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,490
他是科幻小说作家
Who wrote science fiction.

700
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:08,440
-是科学真理的先驱  -个别时候而已
- A precursor to science fact! - In some cases, yeah.

701
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:10,060
如果确实存在爱因斯坦-罗森桥
Well, if there is an Einstein-Rosen Bridge,

702
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:11,500
那另一端一定有别的世界
then there's something on the other side.

703
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:13,650
更先进的生物可以穿过它
And advanced beings could have crossed it!

704
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:14,560
简
Jane.

705
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:16,070
原始的维京人
A primitive culture like the Vikings

706
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,600
可能将他们敬为了神灵
might have worshipped them as deities.

707
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:19,950
对  对  没错  谢谢你
Yes! Yes, exactly. Thank you.

708
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,370
你把我的人
You made my men,

709
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:30,840
一些全世界最训练有素的职业人员
some of the most highly trained professionals in the world,

710
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:34,170
比得像拿最低工资的超市保安
look like a bunch of minimum-wage mall cops.

711
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:36,760
这很伤人
That's hurtful.

712
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:39,140
根据我的经验
In my experience,

713
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:41,910
得是受过类似训练的人
it takes someone who's received similar training

714
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,380
才能像你那样打倒他们
to do what you did to them.

715
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:47,030
告诉我你是在哪里受的训练
Why don't you tell me where you received your training?

716
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:50,970
巴基斯坦  车臣  还是阿富汗
Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan?

717
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,130
你看上去更像是雇佣兵
No, you strike me more as the soldier of fortune type.

718
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:58,790
哪里的  南非吗
Where was it? South Africa?

719
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:02,410
有些组织会花大价钱
Certain groups pay very well

720
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,200
雇佣你这么优秀的佣兵
for a good mercenary like you.

721
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:08,020
你到底是谁
Who are you?

722
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:14,060
无论如何
One way or another,

723
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:16,030
我们都会得到我们想要的信息
we find out what we need to know.

724
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:17,330
这我们很在行
We're good at that.

725
01:02:23,290 --> 01:02:24,330
别乱跑
Don't go anywhere.

726
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:33,490
洛基  你怎么会来这里
Loki! What are you doing here?

727
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:35,060
我得来见见你
I had to see you.

728
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:37,960
发生了什么事
What's happened?

729
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,600
告诉我  是约顿海姆的事吗
Tell me. Is it Jotunheim?

730
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:42,410
让我去和父王解释
Let me explain to Father.

731
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:43,590
父王已经死了
Father is dead.

732
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:51,100
什么
What?

733
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:54,620
对你的驱逐
Your banishment,

734
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:57,600
战争再起的威胁
the threat of a new war,

735
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:01,390
让他难以承受
it was too much for him to bear.

736
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:05,090
你不要自责
You mustn't blame yourself.

737
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:08,460
我知道你爱他
I know that you loved him.

738
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:11,550
我也劝过他  但他听不进去
I tried to tell him so, but he wouldn't listen.

739
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:16,260
明知你已无法拿起雷神之锤
It was so cruel to put the hammer within your reach,

740
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:18,350
还放在你眼前  实在残忍
knowing that you could never lift it.

741
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:24,370
现在王位的重担落在了我肩上
The burden of the throne has fallen to me now.

742
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,800
我能回家吗
Can I come home?

743
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:36,410
和约顿海姆的休战条件就是永远放逐你
The truce with Jotunheim is conditional upon your exile.

744
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:38,170
好吧  但难道没有别的办法...
Yes, but couldn't we find a way...

745
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:42,400
母后也不允许你回家
And Mother has forbidden your return.

746
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,110
我是来告别的  哥哥
This is goodbye, Brother.

747
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,320
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

748
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:58,440
不
No.

749
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:01,480
该道歉的是我
I am sorry.

750
01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:09,010
谢谢你来见我
Thank you for coming here.

751
01:04:13,970 --> 01:04:14,990
永别了
Farewell.

752
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,360
再见
Goodbye.

753
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:31,380
再见
Goodbye?

754
01:04:32,270 --> 01:04:33,430
我才刚回来
I just got back.

755
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:10,570
长官
Sir?

756
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:12,740
有人要见他
He's got a visitor.

757
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:20,070
他的名字是唐纳德·布莱克吗
His name is Donald Blake?

758
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:21,860
唐纳德·布莱克博士
Dr. Donald Blake.

759
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:24,160
你的同事还真危险  塞尔维格博士
You have dangerous coworkers, Dr. Selvig.

760
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,540
他得知你们拿走了
He was distraught when he found out

761
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,940
我们所有的研究资料后心急如焚
that you've taken all our research.

762
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:31,840
那是他一生的心血  就这样没了
That was years of his life, gone!

763
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,770
你该明白  人遇到那种事都会爆发
You can understand how a man could go off like that.

764
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:37,560
像你们这种庞大的秘密组织
A big, faceless organization like yours

765
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:40,430
带着一群穿长靴的暴徒闯进来...
coming in with their jackbooted thugs and...

766
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:43,440
他是这么说的
That's how he put it.

767
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:44,460
这也不足以解释
That still doesn't explain

768
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:46,650
他是如何突破我们的安保系统的
how he managed to tear through our security.

769
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:50,460
兴奋剂呗  他特别喜欢健身
Steroids! He's a bit of a fitness nut.

770
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:52,570
长官
Sir?

771
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:56,290
伪造信息

772
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:59,060
系统显示他是个医学博士
It says here that he's an M.D.

773
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,330
他是  他以前是
Well, he is! Or he was.

774
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:04,320
他后来转行当了一名物理学家
He switched careers and became a physicist.

775
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:05,840
杰出的物理学家
A brilliant physicist.

776
01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:08,650
他是个很棒的人  经历了很多磨难
He's a wonderful man. He's a man in pain.

777
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:13,350
唐尼  唐尼  唐尼
Donny, Donny, Donny!

778
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,490
你在这儿啊  你会没事的
There you are. You're gonna be all right.

779
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,120
我这就带你回家
I'm taking you home now.

780
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:33,840
塞尔维格博士
Dr. Selvig!

781
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:37,260
让他别再靠近围栏了
Just keep him away from the bars.

782
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:39,140
我会的
I will!

783
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,890
-我们去哪  -去喝一杯
- Where are we going? - To get a drink.

784
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:45,530
跟着他们
Follow them.

785
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,910
我全搞错了
You know, I had it all backwards.

786
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:57,770
全错了
I had it all wrong.

787
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:02,530
发现自己不知道
It's not a bad thing finding

788
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:04,570
所有的答案  并不是件坏事
out that you don't have all the answers.

789
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,620
你会开始问正确的问题
You start asking the right questions.

790
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:15,360
这是我人生中第一次
For the first time in my life,

791
01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:20,030
不知道接下来该干什么
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.

792
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:24,030
任何人想在这世上找到属于自己的道路
Anyone who's ever going to find his way in this world

793
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:27,100
都得先承认他不知自己究竟身在何处
has to start by admitting he doesn't know where the hell he is.

794
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:30,940
谢谢你的帮助
Thank you for what you've done.

795
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:33,890
不  不用谢我  我这么做是为了简
No, don't thank me. I only did it for Jane.

796
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:37,510
她爸爸和我曾在一所大学教书
Her father and I taught at university together.

797
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,200
他是个好男人
He was a good man.

798
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:41,990
听不进别人的话
He never listened.

799
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:44,100
我也是
Neither did I.

800
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:47,940
我父亲本想教育我
My father was trying to teach me something,

801
01:07:47,950 --> 01:07:49,740
但我太迟钝了
but I was too stupid to see it.

802
01:07:51,050 --> 01:07:52,420
我不知道你是有妄想症
I don't know if you're delusional

803
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:54,930
还是在耍什么花招
or if you're pulling some kind of con,

804
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:56,020
我不在乎
I don't care.

805
01:07:56,830 --> 01:07:58,180
我只在乎她
I just care about her.

806
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,680
我看到她看你的眼神了
I've seen the way she looks at you.

807
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,790
我对你发誓  我无意伤害她
I swear to you, I mean her no harm.

808
01:08:07,810 --> 01:08:08,700
很好
Good.

809
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,430
这样的话  我再请你喝一杯
In that case, I'll buy you another round,

810
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:13,620
然后你今晚就离开小镇
and you leave town tonight.

811
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:20,260
两杯酒鬼炸弹
Two boilermakers.

812
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:13,330
杀了他
Kill him.

813
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,350
都不顾我为你做了那么多吗
After all I've done for you?

814
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:24,390
原来是你指引我们进入阿斯加德的
So you're the one who showed us the way into Asgard.

815
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:26,460
说实话  那只是找点乐子
That was just a bit of fun, really.

816
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,100
为了毁掉我哥哥的大日子
To ruin my brother's big day.

817
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:32,910
保护我们的王国
And to protect the realm

818
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,930
能再晚些承受他愚蠢的统治
from his idiotic rule for a while longer.

819
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,020
我洗耳恭听
I will hear you.

820
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:47,800
我会掩护你和你几个手下
I will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers,

821
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:49,910
带你们进入奥丁的房间
lead you into Odin's chambers,

822
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,860
你就可以杀了卧床的他
and you can slay him where he lies.

823
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:55,240
你为什么不自己杀了他
Why not kill him yourself?

824
01:09:56,910 --> 01:09:59,680
我想阿斯加德人不会愿意接受
I suspect that the Asgardians would not take kindly

825
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:02,610
一个谋害先王的国王吧
to a king who had murdered his predecessor.

826
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,470
等奥丁死了
Once Odin is dead,

827
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,600
我就把远古冬棺还给你
I will return the Casket to you

828
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:10,910
你就可以让约顿海姆恢复...
and you can return Jotunheim to all its...

829
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,230
昔日光辉
glory.

830
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:18,290
我
I...

831
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,600
接受
accept.

832
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,150
你怎么了  门卫
What troubles you, Gatekeeper?

833
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:31,680
你在约顿海姆时  我试图看你
I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim,

834
01:10:31,690 --> 01:10:33,830
但却看不见也听不见
but could neither see you nor hear you.

835
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:36,150
你被遮蔽了
You were shrouded from me,

836
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:38,720
就像侵入这里的冰霜巨人那样
like the Frost Giants that entered this realm.

837
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,050
也许你是任职太久
Perhaps your senses have weakened

838
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:42,160
感官退化了吧
after your many years of service.

839
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:43,700
也可能是有人找到了办法
Or perhaps someone has found a way

840
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:46,870
隐藏不想被我看到的东西
to hide that which he does not wish me to see.

841
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:50,870
你有强大的力量  海姆达尔
You have great power, Heimdall.

842
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:54,760
奥丁曾畏惧过你吗
Did Odin ever fear you?

843
01:10:56,610 --> 01:10:58,330
-没有  -为什么
- No. - And why is that?

844
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:01,970
因为他是我的国王  我誓死服从他
Because he is my king and I am sworn to obey him.

845
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:05,780
他曾经是你的国王  现在你要服从我了
He was your king and you're sworn to obey me now.

846
01:11:07,150 --> 01:11:08,030
对吗
Yes?

847
01:11:13,390 --> 01:11:14,330
是的
Yes.

848
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,740
那就不准为任何人开启彩虹桥
Then you will open the Bifrost to no one

849
01:11:18,430 --> 01:11:21,390
直到我收拾好我哥留下的烂摊子
until I have repaired the damage that my brother has done.

850
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,060
天哪  他还好吗
Oh, my God. Is he okay?

851
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:40,160
他很好  毫发无伤
He's fine. Not injured at all.

852
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:42,720
真抱歉  我的朋友
I'm sorry, my friend.

853
01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:44,630
-怎么回事  -我们喝酒了  打了一架
- What happened? - We drank, we fought,

854
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,450
他给家族争光了
he made his ancestors proud.

855
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:47,960
把他放到床上去
Put him on the bed.

856
01:11:59,330 --> 01:12:03,140
我还是不相信你是雷神
I still don't think you're the God of Thunder.

857
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:06,050
但你应该是
But you ought to be.

858
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:19,060
这是你的住所吗
Are these your chambers?

859
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:22,620
说是临时住所更合适
It's more of a temporary living situation.

860
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:27,710
抱歉  一般没客人会来
I'm sorry. I don't usually have guests.

861
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:31,170
事实上  从没来过客人
Actually, I never have guests.

862
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,100
放错地方了
That's not the right place for it.

863
01:12:36,430 --> 01:12:37,870
抱歉
I'm sorry.

864
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:42,370
我们出去吧
Can we go outside?

865
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,710
好啊  当然
Yes, of course.

866
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:52,080
我睡不着时就会来这里
I come up here sometimes when I can't sleep

867
01:12:52,090 --> 01:12:54,340
或是整理粒子数据的时候
or I'm trying to reconcile particle data,

868
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:56,670
又或是达西快把我逼疯的时候
or when Darcy's driving me crazy.

869
01:12:57,690 --> 01:13:00,880
仔细想想  我其实经常来这里
I come up here a lot, actually, now that I think about it.

870
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:06,700
真高兴你没事
I'm really glad you're safe.

871
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:10,310
你对我很好
You've been very kind to me,

872
01:13:11,210 --> 01:13:13,600
而相比之下  我的表现太不知感恩了
and I've been far less grateful than you deserve.

873
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:15,170
我开车撞了你几次
Well, I hit you with my car a couple times,

874
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:17,250
我们算是扯平了
so I think that kind of evens things out.

875
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:21,580
也许是我活该被撞
Perhaps I had it coming.

876
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:28,620
天哪
Oh, my God!

877
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,520
难以置信
I don't believe it!

878
01:13:31,690 --> 01:13:33,390
我只能拿回这些
It was all I could get back.

879
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:35,150
很抱歉没能兑现我的承诺
I'm sorry it's not as much as I promised.

880
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:37,620
不  这很棒了  这...
No, no, this is great! This is...

881
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:39,790
我不用再从头开始了
I don't have to start from scratch now.

882
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:41,250
谢谢你
Thank you.

883
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:47,540
怎么了
What's wrong?

884
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,060
神盾局  不管他们是什么组织
S.H.I.E.L.D. Whatever they are,

885
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,450
都会尽一切办法
they're gonna do everything in their power

886
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:57,180
使我们的研究无法得见天日
to make sure this research never sees the light of day.

887
01:13:57,540 --> 01:13:58,570
不  简
No, Jane.

888
01:13:59,510 --> 01:14:01,810
听我说  你不能放弃
Listen to me. You must not give up.

889
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,920
-要有始有终  -为什么
- You must finish what you've started. - Why?

890
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:05,150
因为你是正确的
Because you're right.

891
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:07,140
来  你看
Here, look.

892
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:12,240
你们的祖先称之为魔法
Your ancestors called it magic,

893
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:13,710
你称之为科学
and you call it science.

894
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:14,980
在我的家乡
Well, I come from a place

895
01:14:14,990 --> 01:14:16,760
它们两者是同样的东西
where they're one and the same thing.

896
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:32,560
这是什么
What is that?

897
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:37,040
我父王是这样对我解释的
My father explained it to me like this,

898
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:38,780
你们的世界
that your world

899
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:41,800
是宇宙九大王国之一
is one of the Nine Realms of the Cosmos,

900
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:45,200
连接各王国的是世界树的枝干
linked to each other by the branches of Yggdrasil,

901
01:14:45,210 --> 01:14:46,740
也就是世界之树
the Worlds Tree.

902
01:14:47,490 --> 01:14:50,340
你们每天都看到它  但不自知
Now you see it every day without realizing.

903
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:52,060
这些拍到图像  用...
The images glimpsed through...

904
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,240
你们叫它什么来着
What did you call it?

905
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:56,200
"呼伯望远镜"
This Hooble Telescope.

906
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:58,890
-哈勃  -哈勃望远镜
- Hubble. - Hubble Telescope.

907
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:03,270
再说点吧
Tell me more.

908
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,670
九大王国
So, the Nine Realms.

909
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:08,800
这里是米德加德  也就是地球
Now, there is Midgard, which is Earth.

910
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:10,490
这里是艾尔夫海姆
This is Alfheim.

911
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:12,270
这是华纳海姆
Vanaheim.

912
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:13,950
这是约顿海姆
Jotunheim.

913
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:15,840
这是阿斯加德
And Asgard.

914
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:18,100
这就是我的家
And that's where I come from.

915
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:36,910
谢谢你  简
Thank you, Jane.

916
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:43,320
我们的挚友被驱逐了  洛基登上了王位
Our dearest friend banished, Loki on the throne,

917
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:46,860
阿斯加德面临战祸  而你却在这儿大吃大喝
Asgard on the brink of war, yet you've managed to consume

918
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:50,170
四只野猪  六只雉鸡  半只牛
four wild boar, six pheasant, a side of beef,

919
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:52,730
还有两大桶麦酒  我都替你脸红
and two casks of ale. Shame on you.

920
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:54,010
你就什么都不在乎吗
Don't you care?

921
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:56,770
别把我的胃口理解成冷漠
Do not mistake my appetite for apathy!

922
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:58,360
你们两个  够了
Stop it, both of you!

923
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:00,150
别闹了
Stop.

924
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,980
-我们都清楚该做什么  -我们得行动
- We all know what we have to do. - We must go.

925
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,350
我们得找到托尔
We must find Thor.

926
01:16:09,950 --> 01:16:11,180
那是叛国罪
It's treason.

927
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:13,020
去他的叛国  那是自杀
To hell with treason, it's suicide.

928
01:16:13,130 --> 01:16:15,290
托尔也会为我们铤而走险的
Thor would do the same for us.

929
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:17,480
别说了
Now shush.

930
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:21,170
海姆达尔可能在监视我们呢
Heimdall might be watching.

931
01:16:26,510 --> 01:16:28,580
海姆达尔要见你们
Heimdall demands your presence.

932
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:34,650
我们死定了
We're doomed.

933
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:38,750
你们想违抗我们的国王洛基的命令
You would defy the commands of Loki, our king,

934
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:41,710
打破作为战士曾许下的誓言
break every oath you have taken as warriors,

935
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:44,470
犯下叛国罪把托尔带回来吗
and commit treason to bring Thor back?

936
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:45,630
-是的  -很好
- Yes. - Good.

937
01:16:46,670 --> 01:16:47,810
你要帮我们吗
So you'll help us?

938
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:49,970
我必须效忠国王
I am bound by honor to our king.

939
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:52,330
我不能为你们开启彩虹桥
I cannot open the bridge to you.

940
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:55,100
这家伙真难懂  是吧
Complicated fellow, isn't he?

941
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:56,420
现在我们怎么办
Now what do we do?

942
01:16:58,050 --> 01:16:59,030
你们看
Look!

943
01:17:18,820 --> 01:17:19,970
-刚刚那是什么鬼  -我不知道  长官
- What the hell was that? - I don't know, sir.

944
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:21,590
刚才突然探测到了超强的能量
We got massive energy readings out of nowhere

945
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,800
然后又突然消失
and then they just disappeared.

946
01:17:22,810 --> 01:17:24,180
大概在西北方15英里处
Fifteen miles due northwest.

947
01:17:24,190 --> 01:17:25,250
我们去看看
Let's go take a look.

948
01:17:50,430 --> 01:17:51,360
谢谢
Thank you.

949
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:53,700
-谢谢  -乐意效劳
- Thank you. - You're very welcome.

950
01:18:01,030 --> 01:18:03,640
总部呼叫2队  我们在城外发现异常
Base to Team 2, we've got activity outside the town.

951
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:05,160
盯住你们的目标
Stay on your target.

952
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:16,790
确保我哥哥回不来
Ensure my brother does not return.

953
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:22,110
摧毁一切
Destroy everything.

954
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:34,270
妈妈
Mom?

955
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:44,290
镇上有文艺复兴节吗
Is there a Renaissance Fair in town?

956
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:45,570
报告总部
Call it in.

957
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,510
总部  我们发现了战士公主西娜
Base, we've got Xena,

958
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:53,300
成龙和罗宾汉
Jackie Chan and Robin Hood.

959
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:55,510
这是很棒的理论  简
It's a beautiful theory, Jane.

960
01:18:56,450 --> 01:18:57,040
但你别想
But you won't be able to

961
01:18:57,050 --> 01:18:59,710
说服科学界相信
convince the scientific community of any of it.

962
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:01,200
除非你有证据
Not without hard evidence.

963
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:03,690
找到你了
Found you!

964
01:19:09,630 --> 01:19:10,900
我的朋友们
My friends!

965
01:19:12,590 --> 01:19:15,230
太好了  太好了
This is good! This is good.

966
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:16,370
难以置信
I don't believe it.

967
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:19,700
容我介绍一下  希芙女士和三位勇士
Excuse me. Lady Sif and the Warriors Three.

968
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:23,140
我的朋友们
My friends,

969
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:26,170
我真高兴能见到你们
I've never been happier to see anyone.

970
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,020
但你们不该来
But you should not have come.

971
01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:31,760
我们来带你回家
We're here to take you home.

972
01:19:33,130 --> 01:19:35,080
你们知道我不能回去
You know I can't go home.

973
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:38,230
我的父王
My father is

974
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:41,070
因我而死
dead because of me.

975
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:43,450
我必须继续被流放
And I must remain in exile.

976
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:44,930
托尔
Thor,

977
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,350
你父王还活着
your father still lives.

978
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:03,350
告诉我  洛基
Tell me, Loki,

979
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,870
你怎么把约顿巨人带进阿斯加德的
how did you get the Jotuns into Asgard?

980
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:07,590
你以为彩虹桥是进出王国的
You think the Bifrost is the only way

981
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,170
唯一途径吗
in and out of this realm?

982
01:20:09,190 --> 01:20:10,640
各个王国间有很多密道
There are secret paths between the worlds

983
01:20:10,650 --> 01:20:13,560
哪怕你天赋异禀也看不到
to which even you, with all your gifts, are blind.

984
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:16,930
但我已经不再需要它们了  我是国王了
But I have need of them no longer, now that I am king.

985
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:18,850
我宣布  因为你的叛国行为
And I say, for your act of treason,

986
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:21,700
免除你门卫的职务
you are relieved of your duties as Gatekeeper,

987
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:23,710
你不再是阿斯加德的公民了
and no longer citizen of Asgard.

988
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:26,180
那我就不用听命于你了
Then I need no longer obey you.

989
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:49,110
找语言学部的人来看看
Get somebody from Linguistics down here.

990
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:18,930
还有其他人要来吗
Was somebody else coming?

991
01:21:23,150 --> 01:21:24,390
是斯塔克的吗
Is that one of Stark's?

992
01:21:24,410 --> 01:21:27,950
不知道  他什么都不跟我说
I don't know. The guy never tells me anything.

993
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:32,810
你好
Hello.

994
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:36,020
你正在使用未登记的武器科技
You are using unregistered weapons technology.

995
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,450
请表明身份
Identify yourself.

996
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:42,010
没事啦
Here we go.

997
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:46,810
快跑
Incoming!

998
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:55,730
简  你们快走
Jane, you have to leave.

999
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:57,940
-你呢  -我要留在这儿
- What are you gonna do? - I'm staying here.

1000
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:59,460
托尔要和我们并肩作战
Thor's going to fight with us!

1001
01:22:00,150 --> 01:22:01,100
我的朋友们
My friends,

1002
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,270
我现在肉体凡胎  我只会碍手碍脚
I'm just a man. I'll only be in the way,

1003
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:05,990
甚至连累你们
or worse, get one of you killed.

1004
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,110
但我能帮他们转移去安全的地方
But I can help get these people to safety.

1005
01:22:08,210 --> 01:22:10,340
如果你要留下  我也留下
Well, if you're staying, then so am I.

1006
01:22:10,810 --> 01:22:12,910
-我们需要点时间  -我们帮你争取时间
- We'll need some time. - You'll have it!

1007
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,060
好吧  大家快走吧
Okay, move it, people!

1008
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,010
大家都出去  从后门走
Everybody out! Use the back door.

1009
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:20,140
快走  回头再吃
Go, hurry! You can eat later.

1010
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:33,980
分散他的注意力
Keep it distracted.

1011
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:52,170
为了阿斯加德
For Asgard!

1012
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:28,300
撤退
Fall back!

1013
01:23:44,670 --> 01:23:46,300
跑  快跑
Go. Now. Run!

1014
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:16,790
希芙  希芙  你已经尽力了
Sif. Sif, you've done all you can.

1015
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:19,240
不  死也要死得像个战士
No. I will die a warrior's death.

1016
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:21,060
历史会记住这一刻的
Stories will be told of this day.

1017
01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:24,270
活下去  自己讲述这段历史
Live, and tell those stories yourself.

1018
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:27,940
快跑
Now go.

1019
01:24:36,030 --> 01:24:39,210
你们得回阿斯加德  去阻止洛基
You must return to Asgard. You have to stop Loki.

1020
01:24:39,290 --> 01:24:40,320
那你怎么办
What about you?

1021
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:42,850
别担心  朋友们  我自有打算
Do not worry, my friends. I have a plan.

1022
01:24:43,950 --> 01:24:44,840
走吧
Come on.

1023
01:24:49,070 --> 01:24:51,190
我们快撤退  快走
We need to fall back. Come on.

1024
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:52,810
走啊
Come on.

1025
01:25:00,590 --> 01:25:01,430
等等
Wait!

1026
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:10,610
他要干什么
What's he doing?

1027
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:40,960
弟弟  不管我怎样委屈了你
Brother, whatever I have done to wrong you,

1028
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:44,140
不管我做了什么让你这样
whatever I have done to lead you to do this,

1029
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:46,870
我真的很抱歉
I am truly sorry.

1030
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:49,520
但这些人是无辜的
But these people are innocent.

1031
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:54,170
杀了他们对你没有任何好处
Taking their lives will gain you nothing.

1032
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,140
杀了我吧
So take mine

1033
01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:05,320
然后到此为止
and end this.

1034
01:26:19,630 --> 01:26:20,550
不
No.

1035
01:26:36,610 --> 01:26:37,830
结束了
It's over.

1036
01:26:38,150 --> 01:26:40,400
不  没结束
No. It's not over.

1037
01:26:41,110 --> 01:26:43,360
我是说  你安全了
I mean, you're safe.

1038
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:44,370
我们都很安全
We're safe.

1039
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:46,740
那就行了
It's over.

1040
01:26:53,090 --> 01:26:54,010
不
No.

1041
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:41,900
-出现峰值  -读数上升
- We're spiking. - Levels increase!

1042
01:27:41,910 --> 01:27:43,650
不管是谁持有此锤
Whosoever holds this hammer,

1043
01:27:46,330 --> 01:27:47,700
只要他配得上
if he be worthy,

1044
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:52,620
就将拥有雷神之力
shall possess the power of Thor.

1045
01:28:08,210 --> 01:28:09,190
简
Jane!

1046
01:28:11,790 --> 01:28:12,610
不
No.

1047
01:28:12,690 --> 01:28:13,430
-过来  -不
- Come! - No.

1048
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:14,940
-快走  -不
- Come! - No.

1049
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:39,060
天啊
Oh. My. God.

1050
01:29:48,820 --> 01:29:50,580
这才是你平时的装束吗
So, is this how you normally look?

1051
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:52,180
差不多吧
More or less.

1052
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,500
挺帅的
It's a good look.

1053
01:29:55,150 --> 01:29:56,880
我们得去彩虹桥的落点
We must go to the Bifrost site.

1054
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:58,350
我有话和我弟弟说
I would have words with my brother.

1055
01:29:58,360 --> 01:29:59,390
打扰一下
Excuse me!

1056
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:04,210
唐纳德
Donald?

1057
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:07,070
我认为你没对我说实话
I don't think you've been completely honest with me.

1058
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:08,660
之前讲的起名习惯
托尔以为科尔森的名字也是这个意思

1059
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:08,660
听着  科尔之子
Know this, Son of Coul.

1060
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:10,320
你和我  我们都是在为
You and I, we fight for the same cause,

1061
01:30:10,330 --> 01:30:11,680
保护这个世界而战
the protection of this world.

1062
01:30:11,690 --> 01:30:13,900
从今天起  我与你结盟
From this day forward, you can count me as your ally

1063
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:16,890
但你得把你拿走的简的东西还回来
if you return the items you have taken from Jane.

1064
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:18,320
-偷走的  -借用而已
- Stolen. - Borrowed.

1065
01:30:19,610 --> 01:30:21,440
好吧  你可以拿回你的设备
Of course, you can have your equipment back.

1066
01:30:21,610 --> 01:30:23,550
这样你才能继续你的研究
You're gonna need it to continue your research.

1067
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,370
你想看我跟你说过的那座桥吗
Would you like to see the bridge we spoke of?

1068
01:30:28,070 --> 01:30:29,020
当然
Sure.

1069
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:32,790
等等  我还有事要问你
Wait, I need to debrief you!

1070
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:41,750
欢迎来到阿斯加德
Welcome to Asgard.

1071
01:31:07,150 --> 01:31:09,100
海姆达尔  开启彩虹桥
Heimdall, open the Bifrost.

1072
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:18,140
海姆达尔
Heimdall?

1073
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:23,400
海姆达尔
Heimdall!

1074
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:26,940
他不回应
He doesn't answer.

1075
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:29,560
那我们就被困在这了
Then we are stranded.

1076
01:31:29,570 --> 01:31:32,920
海姆达尔  你能听见吗  我们需要你
Heimdall! If you can hear me, we need you now!

1077
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,930
海姆达尔  我们需要你
Heimdall! We need you now!

1078
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:43,970
海姆达尔
Heimdall!

1079
01:31:58,450 --> 01:32:01,380
我必须回阿斯加德去  但我向你保证
I must go back to Asgard, but I give you my word,

1080
01:32:02,830 --> 01:32:04,960
我会回来找你的
I will return for you.

1081
01:32:12,770 --> 01:32:13,660
好吗
Deal?

1082
01:32:27,690 --> 01:32:28,580
好的
Deal.

1083
01:32:45,230 --> 01:32:46,870
带他去疗伤
Get him to the healing room!

1084
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:50,220
我去找我弟弟
Leave my brother to me.

1085
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:16,490
据说
It's said

1086
01:33:17,190 --> 01:33:22,140
你依然能看见  听见周遭发生的事情
you can still hear and see what transpires around you.

1087
01:33:23,150 --> 01:33:24,980
希望这是真的
I hope it's true,

1088
01:33:27,020 --> 01:33:28,880
那样你就会知道
so that you may know

1089
01:33:29,970 --> 01:33:33,890
你是死在
your death came at the hand

1090
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:36,750
劳菲手里
of Laufey.

1091
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:48,070
而你是死在奥丁之子手里
And your death came by the son of Odin.

1092
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:54,870
洛基
Loki!

1093
01:33:55,370 --> 01:33:56,800
你救了你父王
You saved him!

1094
01:34:01,450 --> 01:34:03,060
我向你发誓  母后
I swear to you, Mother,

1095
01:34:03,570 --> 01:34:06,170
他们会为今天的所作所为付出代价
that they will pay for what they've done today.

1096
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:07,440
洛基
Loki.

1097
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:09,220
托尔
Thor!

1098
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:11,980
我就知道你会回来的
I knew you'd return to us.

1099
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:19,400
你为什么不告诉她
Why don't you tell her

1100
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:23,250
你是怎么派毁灭者去杀我和我们的朋友
how you sent the Destroyer to kill our friends, to kill me?

1101
01:34:23,260 --> 01:34:24,130
什么
What?

1102
01:34:24,270 --> 01:34:26,980
它一定是执行了父王最后的命令
Why, it must have been enforcing Father's last command.

1103
01:34:26,990 --> 01:34:30,050
你是个厉害的骗子  一直都是
You're a talented liar, Brother. Always have been.

1104
01:34:30,390 --> 01:34:31,730
你回来了真好
It's good to have you back.

1105
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:35,300
失陪了  我得去摧毁约顿海姆
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to destroy Jotunheim.

1106
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:18,690
你阻止不了的
You can't stop it.

1107
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:22,240
彩虹桥会一直开启到约顿海姆被撕碎
The Bifrost will build until it rips Jotunheim apart.

1108
01:35:43,850 --> 01:35:44,770
简
Jane?

1109
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,640
你为什么这么做
Why have you done this?

1110
01:35:48,730 --> 01:35:51,870
证明给父王看  我才是他的好儿子
To prove to Father that I am the worthy son.

1111
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:55,190
等他醒来时  是我救了他命
When he wakes, I will have saved his life.

1112
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:58,240
还杀死了那一族的怪物
I will have destroyed that race of monsters.

1113
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:00,790
我会成为王位的真正继承人
And I will be true heir to the throne!

1114
01:36:00,820 --> 01:36:02,840
你不能消灭一整个种族
You can't kill an entire race!

1115
01:36:02,850 --> 01:36:03,830
为什么不能
Why not?

1116
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:10,430
你怎么对冰霜巨人突然产生好感了
And what is this newfound love for the Frost Giants?

1117
01:36:11,180 --> 01:36:14,700
你以前可是会赤手空拳把他们杀光
You could have killed them all with your bare hands.

1118
01:36:14,710 --> 01:36:16,760
-我变了  -我也是
- I've changed. - So have I.

1119
01:36:18,620 --> 01:36:19,630
来打我啊
Now fight me.

1120
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:24,750
我从来没想要王位
I never wanted the throne!

1121
01:36:26,270 --> 01:36:28,570
我只想得到和你一样的对待
I only ever wanted to be your equal.

1122
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,810
我不会和你打的  弟弟
I will not fight you, Brother!

1123
01:36:30,820 --> 01:36:32,050
我不是你弟弟
I'm not your brother.

1124
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:34,450
从来都不是
I never was.

1125
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:36,150
洛基  这简直疯了
Loki, this is madness.

1126
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:37,600
是吗
Is it madness?

1127
01:36:39,150 --> 01:36:40,090
疯狂吗
Is it?

1128
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:42,690
疯狂吗
Is it?

1129
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:45,540
拜托  你在地球上遭遇了什么
Come on. What happened to you on Earth

1130
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:47,750
把你变得这么懦弱
that turned you so soft?

1131
01:36:48,620 --> 01:36:50,150
别跟我说是因为那个女人
Don't tell me it was that woman.

1132
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:54,470
还真是
It was!

1133
01:36:54,770 --> 01:36:57,200
也许  等我们结束了这一切
Well, maybe, when we're finished here,

1134
01:36:57,300 --> 01:36:59,570
我会亲自去看看她
I'll pay her a visit myself!

1135
01:37:41,210 --> 01:37:42,160
托尔
Thor!

1136
01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:51,250
哥哥  救我
Brother, please.

1137
01:38:02,740 --> 01:38:03,870
够了
Enough!

1138
01:38:48,050 --> 01:38:49,120
看看你
Look at you,

1139
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:53,060
强大的托尔
the Mighty Thor,

1140
01:38:56,150 --> 01:38:58,010
力大无穷
with all your strength,

1141
01:38:59,170 --> 01:39:01,130
现在对你又有何用
and what good does it do you now?

1142
01:39:03,030 --> 01:39:06,560
你听到了吗  哥哥  你什么都做不了
Do you hear me, Brother? There's nothing you can do!

1143
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:26,140
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1144
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:30,980
如果你毁了彩虹桥  你就再也见不到她了
If you destroy the bridge, you'll never see her again!

1145
01:39:40,780 --> 01:39:42,070
原谅我  简
Forgive me, Jane.

1146
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:22,510
我本可以做到的  父王
I could have done it, Father!

1147
01:40:23,980 --> 01:40:25,360
我本可以做到的
I could have done it!

1148
01:40:26,390 --> 01:40:27,380
为了你
For you!

1149
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:29,600
为了大家
For all of us!

1150
01:40:31,830 --> 01:40:32,910
不  洛基
No, Loki.

1151
01:40:42,030 --> 01:40:43,240
洛基  不要
Loki, no.

1152
01:40:44,210 --> 01:40:46,210
不
No!

1153
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:51,730
不
No.

1154
01:41:08,150 --> 01:41:09,160
结束了
It's gone.

1155
01:42:22,030 --> 01:42:24,940
然后  我一声大吼
And then, with a mighty bellow,

1156
01:42:25,130 --> 01:42:29,870
飞进了铁巨人的体内  把他放倒了
I flew into the giant metal creature and laid him low!

1157
01:42:30,020 --> 01:42:32,920
那是摔了个四脚朝天的意思吗
Is that another way of saying you fell on your huge ass?

1158
01:42:32,930 --> 01:42:34,310
事实上
As a matter of fact,

1159
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:39,300
摔倒只是蒙蔽毁灭者的策略
falling was a tactic lulling the Destroyer...

1160
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:55,770
王后陛下  您儿子的事我很遗憾
My Queen, I'm so sorry for your loss.

1161
01:43:01,910 --> 01:43:02,940
他怎么样了
How is he?

1162
01:43:05,550 --> 01:43:07,210
他在悼念他的弟弟
He mourns for his brother.

1163
01:43:08,970 --> 01:43:09,940
还有...
And...

1164
01:43:11,310 --> 01:43:12,500
他思念她
He misses her.

1165
01:43:13,870 --> 01:43:14,840
那个凡人
The mortal.

1166
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:33,150
你将会是个明君
You'll be a wise king.

1167
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:40,090
不会再有比你更贤明的君主
There will never be a wiser king than you.

1168
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:42,810
和更完美的父亲了
Or a better father.

1169
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:57,450
我有很多要学的
I have much to learn.

1170
01:43:59,380 --> 01:44:00,400
我现在知道了
I know that now.

1171
01:44:05,970 --> 01:44:07,470
也许有一天  
Someday, perhaps,

1172
01:44:09,270 --> 01:44:10,750
我会让你以我为傲
I shall make you proud.

1173
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:20,220
你已经让我骄傲了
You've already made me proud.

1174
01:44:35,270 --> 01:44:37,050
我们再也到不了地球了
So Earth is lost to us.

1175
01:44:38,630 --> 01:44:39,530
不
No.

1176
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:42,250
希望总是有的
There is always hope.

1177
01:44:46,710 --> 01:44:47,840
你能看到她吗
Can you see her?

1178
01:44:51,150 --> 01:44:52,150
能
Yes.

1179
01:44:56,310 --> 01:44:58,020
我拿了粒子探测仪
I have the particle detectors!

1180
01:44:58,040 --> 01:45:00,380
达西  你拿神盾局的卫星密码了吗
Darcy, do you have the S.H.I.E.L.D. satellite codes?

1181
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:02,550
嗯  你看见我的电击枪了吗
Yeah. Have you seen my Taser?

1182
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:03,600
她还好吗
How is she?

1183
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:06,290
上车  走吧  简
In the car. Come on, Jane!

1184
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:08,400
她在找你
She searches for you.

1185
01:46:54,300 --> 01:47:00,090
雷    神

1186
01:53:18,050 --> 01:53:19,590
塞尔维格博士
Dr. Selvig.

1187
01:53:22,980 --> 01:53:24,700
你就是那个幕后主脑吗
So you're the man behind all this?

1188
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:28,760
这里像个迷宫
It's quite a labyrinth.

1189
01:53:29,990 --> 01:53:33,790
我还以为他们要带我来杀了我
I was thinking they're taking me down here to kill me.

1190
01:53:41,100 --> 01:53:43,960
我听说了新墨西哥州的事
I've been hearing about the New Mexico situation.

1191
01:53:44,990 --> 01:53:46,850
你的工作让很多比我聪明的人
Your work has impressed a lot of people

1192
01:53:46,860 --> 01:53:48,640
非常倾佩
who are much smarter than I am.

1193
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:50,450
我手里的资料多
I have a lot to work with.

1194
01:53:51,260 --> 01:53:54,730
福斯特的理论  通往另一个世界的通道
The Foster Theory. A gateway to another dimension.

1195
01:53:55,210 --> 01:53:56,450
这是前所未有的
It's unprecedented.

1196
01:53:58,980 --> 01:53:59,890
不是吗
Isn't it?

1197
01:54:03,510 --> 01:54:06,810
传说和历史之间总是有区别
Legend tells us one thing, history, another.

1198
01:54:07,210 --> 01:54:08,170
但也有时候
But every now and then,

1199
01:54:08,190 --> 01:54:11,130
两者会发生重叠
we find something that belongs to both.

1200
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:20,420
这是什么
What is it?

1201
01:54:20,430 --> 01:54:21,690
力量  博士
Power, Doctor.

1202
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:23,910
如果我们能弄清怎么利用它
If we can figure out how to tap it,

1203
01:54:24,420 --> 01:54:26,360
也许就能拥有无尽的力量
maybe unlimited power.

1204
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:33,900
我想这值得一试
Well, I guess that's worth a look.

1205
01:54:35,740 --> 01:54:37,750
我想这值得一试
Well, I guess that's worth a look.
