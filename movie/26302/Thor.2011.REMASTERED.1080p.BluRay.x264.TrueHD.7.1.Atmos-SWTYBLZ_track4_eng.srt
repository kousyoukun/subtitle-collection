1
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,040
Wait for it.

2
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,952
- Can I turn on the radio?
- No.

3
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,963
Jane, you can't keep doing this.

4
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,797
The last 17 occurrences
have been predictable to the second.

5
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,382
Jane, you're an astrophysicist,
not some storm chaser.

6
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,308
I'm telling you, there's a connection

7
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:47,183
between these atmospheric
disturbances and my research.

8
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:51,859
Erik, I wouldn't have asked you to fly
out here if I wasn't absolutely sure.

9
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:53,314
Jane?

10
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,986
I think you want to see this.

11
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:00,488
What is that?

12
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,502
I thought you said
it was a subtle auroral

13
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:11,749
gol

14
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,012
- Get closer.
- Right. Good one.

15
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,179
Gol

16
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,150
What are you doing?

17
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,327
I am not dying for six college credits!

18
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,263
I think that was legally your fault.

19
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,844
Get the first aid kit.

20
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,603
Do me a favour and don't be dead.

21
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,976
Please.

22
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:18,816
Where did he come from?

23
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,336
Once,

24
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:42,170
mankind accepted a simple truth,

25
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:45,927
that they were not alone
in this universe.

26
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:51,936
Some worlds man believed
to be home to their gods.

27
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:55,016
Others, they knew to fear.

28
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,365
From a realm of cold and darkness
came the frost giants,

29
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:21,257
Threatening to plunge the mortal world
into a new ice age.

30
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,685
But humanity
would not face this threat alone.

31
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:12,601
Our armies drove the frost giants
back into the heart of their own world.

32
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,227
The cost was great.

33
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,650
In the ena,

34
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,944
their king fell.

35
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:30,610
And the source of their power
was taken from them.

36
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,781
With the last great war ended,

37
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:38,209
we withdrew from the other worlds
and returned home

38
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,457
fo the realm eternal,

39
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,461
asgard.

40
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,748
Here we remain as a beacon of hope,

41
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,670
shining out across the stars.

42
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:26,049
And though we have fallen
into man's myths and legends,

43
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,628
it was asgard

44
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,714
and its warriors

45
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,264
that brought peace

46
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,012
to the universe.

47
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,727
But the day will come

48
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,605
when one of you

49
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,528
will have to defend that peace.

50
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,444
Do the frost giants still live?

51
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,785
When I'm king,

52
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,779
I'll hunt the monsters down
and slay them all!

53
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,456
Just as you did, father.

54
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,583
A wise king

55
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,750
never seeks out war.

56
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,171
But he must always be ready for it.

57
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,442
- I'm ready, father.
- Soaml I.

58
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,397
Only one of you can ascend
to the throne.

59
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:34,485
But both of you were born to be kings.

60
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,597
Oh, please.

61
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,691
Thor odinson,

62
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,786
my heir,

63
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,745
my firstborn.

64
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:11,006
So long entrusted with
the mighty hammer Mjolnir,

65
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:14,175
forged in the heart of a dying star,

66
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,505
its power has no equal,

67
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:20,306
as a weapon to destroy

68
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,600
or as a tool to build.

69
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,891
"Tis a fit companion for a king.

70
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,982
I have defended asgard

71
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:34,154
and the lives of the innocent
across the nine realms

72
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,606
from the time of the great beginning.

73
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:38,942
Though the day has come...

74
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,263
Do you swear to guard
the nine realms?

75
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,900
I swear.

76
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:13,189
And do you swear
to preserve the peace?

77
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,777
I swear.

78
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,862
Do you swear

79
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,483
to cast aside all selfish ambition

80
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,453
and to pledge yourself only
to the good of the realms?

81
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,700
I swear!

82
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,370
Then, on this day,

83
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,076
I, Odin allfather,

84
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,167
proclaim you...

85
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:47,973
The frost giants!

86
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,309
The jotuns must pay
for what they've done!

87
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,735
They have paid, with their lives.

88
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,898
The destroyer did its work,

89
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,233
the casket is safe, and all is well.

90
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:44,578
All 1s well?

91
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,117
They broke into the weapons vault!

92
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,790
If the frost giants had stolen
even one of these relics...

93
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,118
- They didn't.
- Well, I want to know why!

94
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,130
I have a truce with laufey,
king of the jotuns.

95
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:02,798
He just broke your truce!
They know you are vulnerable!

96
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,842
What action would you take?

97
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:08,300
March into Jotunheim as you once did.
Teach them a lesson.

98
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:09,801
Break their spirits

99
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,012
so they'll never dare
try to cross our borders again.

100
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,459
You're thinking only as a warrior.

101
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,723
This was an act of war!

102
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,058
It was the act of but a few,
doomed to fail.

103
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,643
Look how far they got!

104
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,178
We will find the breach in our defences
and it will be sealed.

105
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,572
As king of asgard...

106
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,401
But you're not king!

107
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,662
Not yet.

108
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,398
It's unwise to be in my company
right now, brother.

109
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:08,326
This was to be my day of triumph.

110
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,871
It'll come.

111
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,452
In time.

112
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,785
What's this?

113
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:21,373
If it's any consolation,
I think you're right.

114
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,300
About the frost giants,
about laufey, about everything.

115
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,258
If they found a way to penetrate
asgard's defences once,

116
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,885
who's to say they won't try again?

117
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,012
- Next time with an army.
- Exactly.

118
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,887
There's nothing you can do
without defying father.

119
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,897
No, no, no. I know that look.

120
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,255
That's the only way
to ensure the safety of our borders.

121
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,359
Thor, it's madness.

122
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:45,276
Madness? What sort of madness?

123
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,573
We're going to Jotunheim.

124
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,197
What?

125
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,487
This isn't like a journey to earth

126
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,618
where you summon
a little lightning and thunder,

127
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:57,371
and the mortals worship you as a god.

128
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,747
This is Jotunheim.

129
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,121
My father fought his way into Jotunheim,

130
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,957
defeated their armies
and took their casket.

131
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,708
We would just be looking for answers.

132
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,088
It is forbidden!

133
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,427
My friends, have you forgotten
all that we have done together?

134
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,555
Fandral, hogun.

135
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,512
Who led you
into the most glorious of battles?

136
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,480
You did.

137
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,892
And volstagg,
to delicacies so succulent,

138
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,568
you thought you'd died
and gone to Valhalla?

139
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,990
You did.

140
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,110
Yes!

141
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,157
And who proved wrong
all who scoffed at the idea

142
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,701
that a young maiden could be
one of the fiercest warriors

143
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:33,829
this realm has ever known?

144
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,873
I did.

145
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,911
True, but I supported you, sif.

146
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,333
My friends,

147
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,745
we're going to Jotunheim.

148
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,180
You leave this to me.

149
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,468
- Good Heimdall...
- You're not dressed warmly enough.

150
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:39,678
I'm sorry?

151
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,556
Do you think that you can deceive me?

152
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,594
- You must be mistaken...
- Enough!

153
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,234
Heimdall, may we pass?

154
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:56,821
Never has an enemy slipped my watch
until this day.

155
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,323
I wish to know how that happened.

156
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:03,034
Then tell no one where we have gone
until we've returned.

157
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,960
Understand?

158
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,584
What happened?
Silver tongue turn to lead?

159
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,680
Be warned.

160
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:02,348
I will honour my sworn oath
to protect this realm as its gatekeeper.

161
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,809
If your return
threatens the safety of asgard,

162
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,266
Bifrost will remain closed to you

163
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,816
and you'll be left to die
in the cold waste of Jotunheim.

164
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,862
Couldn't you just
leave the bridge open for us?

165
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,235
To leave the bridge open

166
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,487
would unleash
the full power of the Bifrost

167
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,570
and destroy Jotunheim with you upon it.

168
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,954
I have no plans to die today.

169
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,748
None do.

170
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,288
We shouldn't be here.

171
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,091
Let's move.

172
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,276
Where are they?

173
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,690
Hiding,

174
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,363
as cowards always do.

175
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:34,083
You've come a long way to die,
asgardians.

176
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,710
I am Thor odinson!

177
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,792
We know who you are.

178
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,461
How did your people get into asgard?

179
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:54,933
The house of Odin is full of traitors.

180
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,518
Do not dishonour my father's name
with your lies!

181
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:01,447
Your father is a murderer and a thief!

182
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,901
And why have you come here?
To make peace?

183
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:08,245
You long for battle. You crave it.

184
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,827
You're nothing but a boy

185
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:13,497
trying to prove himself a man.

186
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:18,213
Well, this "boy"
has grown tired of your mockery.

187
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,340
Thor, stop and think.

188
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,133
Look around you, we're outnumbered.

189
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,934
Know your place, brother.

190
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,605
You know not
what your actions would unleash.

191
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,604
I do.

192
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:43,481
Go now, while I still allow it.

193
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,499
We will accept your most gracious offer.

194
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,600
Come on, brother.

195
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,350
Run back home, little Princess.

196
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,820
Damn.

197
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,442
Next?

198
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,841
At least make it a challenge for me!

199
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,860
That's more like it.

200
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:47,772
Don't let them touch you!

201
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,906
Thor!

202
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:35,278
- We must go!
- Then go!

203
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,511
Run!

204
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:03,814
Thor!

205
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,881
Heimdall!

206
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,879
Open the bridge!

207
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:21,030
Father! We'll finish them together!

208
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:22,536
Silence!

209
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:29,918
Allfather.

210
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,417
You look weary.

211
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,712
Laufey,

212
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,631
end this now.

213
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,758
Your boy sought this out.

214
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,673
You're right.

215
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,223
And these are the actions of a boy,
treat them as such.

216
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:52,482
You and I can end this here and now,
before there's further bloodshed.

217
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:56,232
We are beyond diplomacy now,
allfather.

218
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,985
He'll get what he came for.

219
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:01,112
War

220
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,193
and death.

221
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,329
So be it.

222
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,013
Why did you bring us back?

223
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,544
Do you realise what you've done?
What you've started?

224
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:35,651
- I was protecting my home.
- You cannot even protect your friends!

225
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,477
How can you hope
to protect a kingdom?

226
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,279
Get him to the healing room! Now!

227
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:43,154
There won't be a kingdom to protect
if you're afraid to act.

228
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,746
The jotuns must learn to fear me,
just as they once feared you.

229
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,449
That's pride and vanity talking,
not leadership.

230
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:53,585
You've forgotten everything I taught you
about a warrior's Patience.

231
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:57,335
While you wait and be patient,
the nine realms laugh at us.

232
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,794
The old ways are done.

233
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:01,548
You'd stand giving speeches
while asgard falls.

234
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:05,130
You are a vain, greedy, cruel boy!

235
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:08,259
And you are an old man and a fool!

236
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,274
Yes.

237
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,773
I was a fool

238
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,029
to think you were ready.

239
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,658
Father...

240
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:29,280
Thor odinson,

241
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:34,038
you have betrayed
the express command of your king.

242
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,916
Through your arrogance and stupidity,

243
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:39,874
you've opened these peaceful realms
and innocent lives

244
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,677
to the horror and desolation of war!

245
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:53,641
You are unworthy of these realms!

246
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:56,557
You're unworthy of your title!

247
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,313
You're unworthy

248
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:05,445
of the loved ones you have betrayed.

249
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,915
I now take from you your power!

250
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:22,090
In the name of my father

251
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,384
and his father before,

252
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,342
I, Odin allfather, cast you out!

253
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:37,272
Whosoever holds this hammer,
if he be worthy,

254
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,020
shall possess the power of Thor.

255
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,751
I think that was legally your fault.

256
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,507
Get the first aid kit.

257
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,012
Do me a favour and don't be dead.

258
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,103
Does he need cpr?
Because I totally know cpr.

259
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,443
Where did he come from?

260
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,369
You all right?

261
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,543
Hammer?

262
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:38,836
Hammer?

263
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,080
Yeah, we can tell you're hammered.
It's pretty obvious.

264
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,084
Oh, my god. Erik, look at this!

265
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,963
We have to move quickly
before this all changes.

266
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,711
Jane, we have to take him
to the hospital.

267
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,222
- Father!
- He's fine, look at him.

268
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:56,302
Heimdall! I know you can hear me!
Open the Bifrost!

269
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,307
Hospital. You go, I'll stay.

270
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,889
You. What realm is this?

271
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,474
Altheim? Nornheim?

272
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:03,611
New Mexico?

273
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:08,029
You dare threaten me, Thor,
with so puny a weapon?

274
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,527
What? He was freaking me out!

275
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,988
Next time
you decide to taser somebody,

276
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,495
make sure he's already in the car, okay?

277
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,785
Jane! Come on.

278
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:40,854
Name?

279
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:43,478
He said it was Thor?

280
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,818
T-h-o-r.

281
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,896
- And your relationship to him?
- I've never met him before.

282
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,481
Until she hit him with a car.

283
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,280
I grazed him, but she tasered him.

284
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,910
Yes, I did.

285
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,624
Hi.

286
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,081
Just taking a little blood.

287
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:03,497
How dare you attack the son of Odin?

288
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,453
I need some help!

289
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:08,086
Call security!

290
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,504
Security to er 3, stat!

291
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,475
You're no match for the mighty...

292
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:30,789
You don't think
this was just a magnetic storm, do you?

293
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,879
Look, the lensing around these edges

294
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,378
is characteristic
of an Einstein-rosen bridge.

295
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:37,633
A what?

296
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,869
- I thought you were a science major?
- Political science.

297
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,724
She was the only applicant.

298
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:44,473
An Einstein-rosen bridge
is a theoretical connection

299
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,875
between two different points
of space-time.

300
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,230
It's a wormhole.

301
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:50,309
- Erik, look. What do you see?
- Stars.

302
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,234
Yeah, but not our stars.

303
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:56,065
See, this is the star alignment
for our quadrant this time of year,

304
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,276
and unless ursa minor decided
to take a day off,

305
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,578
these are
someone else's constellations.

306
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,496
Hey! Check this out.

307
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,084
No, it can't be.

308
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,259
I think I left something at the hospital.

309
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:33,856
It's not possible!

310
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,243
He was on drugs or something.
He just went nuts.

311
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,549
Oh, my god.

312
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,100
I just lost
my most important piece of evidence.

313
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,222
Typical.

314
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:09,475
- So now what?
- We find him.

315
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:10,931
Did you see what he did in there?

316
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,812
I'm not sure finding him is the best idea.

317
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,298
Well, our data can't tell us
what it was like to be inside that event,

318
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:17,984
and he can. So, we're gonna find him.

319
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,109
Okay.

320
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,816
So we're gonna look
all over new Mexico, right?

321
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,242
Exactly.

322
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,542
What?

323
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:32,749
I'm so sorry.
I swear I'm not doing this on purpose.

324
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,437
I got it, I got it.

325
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,073
Come on, kick it in now!

326
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:12,959
Did it work?

327
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,892
Sir, we found it.

328
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:47,493
You know, for a crazy homeless person,
he's pretty cut.

329
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,616
Hey, sorry I tased you!

330
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,037
Excuse me, excuse me!

331
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,799
What is this?

332
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:09,967
My ex.

333
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,513
Good with patients
and bad with relationships.

334
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,086
They're the only clothes I had
that would fit you.

335
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,145
They will suffice.

336
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,237
You're welcome.

337
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,777
This mortal form has grown weak.

338
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,692
I need sustenance.

339
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,759
We should never have let him go.

340
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,503
There was no stopping him.

341
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:48,554
Well, at least he's only banished,
not dead.

342
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,926
Which 1s what we'd all be

343
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:52,725
if that guard hadn't told Odin
where we'd gone.

344
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,600
How did the guard even know?

345
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,192
I told him.

346
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:04,691
What?

347
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:07,365
I told him to go to Odin after we'd left.

348
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,929
He should be flogged for taking so long.

349
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,489
We should never have
reached Jotunheim.

350
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,615
You told the guard?

351
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,701
I saved our lives.

352
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,623
And Thor's.

353
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,167
I had no idea father would banish him
for what he did.

354
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,380
Loki.

355
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:23,923
You must go to the allfather
and convince him to change his mind.

356
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,634
And if I do, then what?

357
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,554
I love Thor more dearly than any of you,
but you know what he is.

358
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,757
He's arrogant.
He's reckless. He's dangerous.

359
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,808
You saw how he was today.

360
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,704
Is that what asgard needs from its king?

361
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:46,067
He may speak of the good of asgard,
but he's always been jealous of Thor.

362
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:49,236
We should be grateful to him,
he saved our lives.

363
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,405
Laufey said

364
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,987
there were traitors in the house of Odin.

365
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:58,913
A master of magic
could bring three jotuns into asgard.

366
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,416
Loki's always been one for mischief,

367
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,919
but you're talking
about something else entirely.

368
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,777
Stop!

369
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:31,941
Am I cursed?

370
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:33,447
No.

371
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,785
What am I?

372
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,292
You're my son.

373
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,463
What more than that?

374
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,891
The casket wasn't the only thing
you took from Jotunheim that day,

375
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:01,982
was it?

376
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,071
No.

377
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,241
In the aftermath of the battle,

378
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:16,161
I went into the temple
and I found a baby.

379
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,501
Small for a giant's offspring.

380
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,830
Abandoned, suffering, left to die.

381
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,499
Laufey's son.

382
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:33,007
Laufey's son.

383
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:37,848
Yes.

384
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:42,436
Why?

385
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:46,190
You were knee-deep in jotun blood,
why would you take me?

386
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,767
You were an innocent child.

387
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:51,855
No. You took me for a purpose.
What was it?

388
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,527
Tell me!

389
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:02,040
I thought
we could unite our kingdoms one day.

390
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:05,460
Bring about an alliance,
bring about permanent peace.

391
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,128
Through you.

392
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:08,375
What?

393
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:11,796
But those plans no longer matter.

394
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:16,630
So I am no more
than another stolen relic,

395
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,181
locked up here
until you might have use of me.

396
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,724
Why do you twist my words?

397
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,873
You could have told me what I was
from the beginning,

398
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:23,897
why didn't you?

399
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,308
You're my son.

400
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,982
I wanted only to protect you
from the truth.

401
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,060
Because I'm the monster

402
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,237
parents tell their children about
at night?

403
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,402
- No, no.
- You know, it all makes sense now!

404
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,235
Why you favoured Thor all these years!

405
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,196
Because no matter how much
you claim to love me,

406
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:44,908
you could never have a frost giant
sitting on the throne of asgard!

407
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,270
Guards!

408
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:09,269
Guards, please, help!

409
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:16,856
How'd you get inside that cloud?

410
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:19,609
Also, how could you eat
an entire box of pop-tarts

411
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:21,240
and still be this hungry?

412
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:29,411
- This drink, I like it.
- I know. It's great, right?

413
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,620
Another!

414
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,706
Sorry, Izzy. Little accident.

415
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:39,387
- What was that?
- It was delicious. I want another.

416
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,681
- Well, you could have just said so.
- I just did.

417
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:45,176
- No, I mean, ask nicely.
- I meant no disrespect.

418
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,631
All right. Well, no more smashing.

419
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:47,936
Deal?

420
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,401
You have my word.

421
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:53,688
Good.

422
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,938
The usual, please, Izzy.

423
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:59,566
You missed all the excitement
out at the crater.

424
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:03,077
They're saying some kind of satellite
landed out in the desert.

425
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:05,029
Yeah, we were having
a good time with it

426
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:06,823
until the feds showed up.

427
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:09,751
Excuse me.
Did you say there was a satellite crash?

428
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:10,872
Yeah.

429
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:13,375
Oh, my god. This is going on Facebook.
Smile.

430
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,671
What did it look like, the satellite?

431
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:21,425
I don't know anything about satellites,
but it was heavy.

432
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:25,675
I mean, nobody could lift it.

433
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:28,432
They said it was radioactive.
I had my hands all over it.

434
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,179
Which way?

435
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,351
Fifty miles west of here.

436
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,401
Well, I wouldn't waste my time!

437
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:38,489
Looked like the whole army
was coming when we left.

438
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,660
Dumbass!

439
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:46,829
Where are you going?

440
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,244
- Fifty miles west of here.
- Why?

441
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:52,702
- To get what belongs to me.
- So you own a satellite now?

442
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:53,857
It's not what they say it is.

443
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:54,916
Well, whatever it is,

444
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,401
the government seems to think
it's theirs.

445
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,461
So, you just intend to go in there
and take it?

446
00:43:58,553 --> 00:43:59,633
Yes.

447
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:02,303
If you take me there now,

448
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,070
I'll tell you everything you wish to know.

449
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,639
Everything? Yes.

450
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,513
All the answers you seek will be yours
once I reclaim Mjolnir.

451
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,640
Myeu-muh? What's myeu-muh?

452
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,687
Can I have a word, Jane?

453
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,227
Please don't do this.

454
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,396
You saw what I saw last night.

455
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,970
This is no coincidence.
We have to find out what's in that crater.

456
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:25,013
But I'm not talking about the crater,
I'm talking about him.

457
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,744
- But he's promising us the answers.
- He's delusional.

458
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:28,912
Listen to what he's saying.

459
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:32,871
He's talking about Mjolnir
and Thor and Bifrost.

460
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,419
It's the stories I grew up with as a child.

461
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,339
I'm just going to drive him. That's it.

462
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:40,542
He's dangerous, Jane.

463
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:49,387
I'm sorry, but I can't take you.

464
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:50,934
Then this is where we say goodbye.

465
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,068
Thank you?

466
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,566
Jane foster,

467
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,242
Erik selvig,

468
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:08,820
Darcy,

469
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,371
farewell.

470
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:15,334
All right.

471
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:17,586
Back to work.

472
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:39,608
That's my stuff!

473
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:45,610
What the hell is going on here?

474
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,692
Ms foster,
I'm agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.

475
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:49,448
Is that supposed to mean something
to me?

476
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:50,823
- You can't do this!
- Jane!

477
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:54,040
Jane, this is a lot more serious
than you realise. Let it go.

478
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,162
Let it go? This is my life.

479
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,502
We're investigating a security threat.

480
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,296
We need to appropriate your records
and all your atmospheric data.

481
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:03,796
By "appropriate," do you mean steal?

482
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,592
Here, this should
more than compensate you

483
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,680
for your trouble.

484
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:09,343
I can't just buy replacements
at radio shack,

485
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,139
I made most of this equipment myself!

486
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:12,587
Then I'm sure you can do it again.

487
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:15,762
And I'm sure I can sue you
for violating my constitutional rights!

488
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,347
I'm sorry, ms foster,
but we're the good guys.

489
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,524
So are wel

490
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,819
I'm on the verge of understanding
something extraordinary.

491
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,692
And everything I know
about this phenomenon

492
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,648
is either in this lab or in this book.

493
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:30,450
And you can't just take this away... hey!

494
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:34,330
Jane! Easy! Easy. Jane...

495
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,583
Thank you for your cooperation.

496
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:58,270
Years of research,

497
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,357
gone.

498
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:02,266
They even took my iPod.

499
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:05,023
- What about the backups?
- They took our backups.

500
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:08,773
They took the backups of our backups.
They were extremely thorough.

501
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:11,200
I just downloaded, like,
30 songs onto there.

502
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:14,199
Could you please stop with your iPod?

503
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:16,910
Who are these people?

504
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,367
I knew this scientist.

505
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:23,412
The pioneer in gamma radiation.

506
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,623
S.h.lle.l.d. Showed up

507
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:28,547
and he wasn't heard from again.

508
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:32,801
They're not gonna do that to us.
I'm gonna get everything back.

509
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:35,679
Come on, please.
Let me contact one of my colleagues.

510
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:38,268
He's had some dealings
with these people before.

511
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,979
I'll e-mail him and maybe he can help.

512
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:43,482
They took your laptop, too.

513
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:55,153
Allfather,
we must speak with you urgently.

514
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,001
My friends.

515
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:12,007
Where's Odin?

516
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:15,176
Father has fallen into the odinsleep.

517
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:19,347
Mother fears
he may never awaken again.

518
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,061
We would speak with her.

519
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:24,436
She has refused to leave
my father's bedside.

520
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:29,437
You can bring your urgent matter to me.

521
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,203
Your king.

522
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:53,761
My king, we would ask
that you end Thor's banishment.

523
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:01,849
My first command
canhot be to undo the allfather's last.

524
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,099
We're on the brink of war
with Jotunheim.

525
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:11,146
Our people need a sense of continuity,

526
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,027
in order to feel safe
in these difficult times.

527
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:17,030
All of us must stand together

528
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:19,533
for the good of asgard.

529
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:23,582
Yes, of course.

530
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:26,877
- Good. Then you will wait for my word.
- If I may

531
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:33,043
beg the indulgence of your majesty
to perhaps reconsider...

532
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,380
We're done!

533
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:39,369
I need a horse!

534
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:44,785
We don't have horses.
Just dogs, cats, birds...

535
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:47,124
Then give me one of those
large enough to ride.

536
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,289
Hey, you still need a lift?

537
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:57,214
I've never done anything like this before.

538
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:01,964
Have you ever done
anything like this before?

539
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,549
Many times.

540
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:05,885
But you're brave to do it.

541
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:08,517
Well, they just stole
my entire life's work.

542
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:10,518
I don't really have much left to lose.

543
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:12,902
Yeah, but you're clever.

544
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:16,900
Far more clever than anyone else
in this realm.

545
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:19,523
"Realm"? "Realm"?

546
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:22,694
- You think me strange.
- Yeah, I do.

547
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:25,579
Good strange or bad strange?

548
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,747
I'm not quite sure yet.

549
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,417
I'm sorry.

550
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:40,670
But who are you?

551
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,264
Really?

552
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,222
You'll see soon enough.

553
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,679
You promised me answers.

554
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,226
What you seek, it's a bridge.

555
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,486
Like an Einstein-rosen bridge?

556
00:51:58,574 --> 00:51:59,734
More like a rainbow bridge.

557
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,194
God, I hope you're not crazy.

558
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:18,378
I never get used to seeing him like this.

559
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:22,303
He's put it off for so long now,
that I fear...

560
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,548
How long will it last?

561
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:31,220
I don't know. This time it's different.
We were unprepared.

562
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:35,145
So why did he lie?

563
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:40,229
He kept the truth from you
so that you would never feel different.

564
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:42,656
You are our son, loki,

565
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,276
and we, your family.

566
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:51,157
We mustn't lose hope
that your father will return to us.

567
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:53,826
And your brother.

568
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:57,086
What hope is there for Thor?

569
00:52:57,341 --> 00:53:00,925
There's always a purpose
to everything your father does.

570
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:35,284
That's no satellite crash!

571
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:36,690
They would have hauled
the wreckage away,

572
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:38,394
they wouldn't have built a city around it.

573
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:43,209
- You're going to need this.
- What? Wait, why?

574
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:47,888
Now stay here.

575
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:51,800
Once I have Mjolnir, I will return
the items they've stolen from you.

576
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:53,146
Deal?

577
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:55,808
No. Look what's down there.

578
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,766
You think you're just gonna walk in,
grab our stuff and walk out?

579
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:00,897
No. I'm going to fly out.

580
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:11,571
Sir, feed from the keyhole
can barely penetrate the cloud cover.

581
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,200
Tech's barely working as it is,

582
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:15,499
with all the interference
that thing's giving off.

583
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,331
And we've got a commercial aircraft
coming right over us.

584
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:21,505
Southwest airlines, flight 5434.

585
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:22,832
Reroute it like all the others.

586
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:24,587
Hold a sec.

587
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:28,012
We've got something outside the fence,
West Side.

588
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:31,549
Delancey, Jackson.
West Side perimeter. Go check it out.

589
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,393
There it is.

590
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:45,813
Delancey, Jackson. Report.

591
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,035
Agent down.
We've got a perimeter breach.

592
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:13,132
You've reached dr Erik selvig.
Please leave me a message.

593
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:17,140
Hi, Erik, it's me. Don't worry, I'm fine,

594
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:19,847
but just in case
you don't hear from me in the next hour,

595
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:22,809
just come by the crater site
and try and find me, okay?

596
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:25,736
I did exactly what you told me not to.
I'm sorry.

597
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,479
So sorry. Bye.

598
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,613
Bravo quadrant, move!

599
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:47,249
Entering south tunnel!

600
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:50,924
Negative, negative.
I have no comms.

601
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:06,818
Target sighted, east tunnel!

602
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,778
I need eyes up high, with a gun.

603
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:35,764
Moving north!

604
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:44,734
What have we got?

605
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:46,338
There's a massive
electromagnetic surge

606
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:47,518
coming off that thing.

607
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:49,399
Systems are barely coping.

608
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:51,313
Barton? Talk to me.

609
00:56:52,701 --> 00:56:54,316
You want me to slow him down, sir?

610
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,778
Or are you sending in more guys
for him to beat up?

611
00:56:57,998 --> 00:56:59,488
I'll let you know.

612
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:15,679
You're big.

613
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:18,132
Fought bigger.

614
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:06,480
Better call it, Coulson,
'cause I'm starting to root for this guy.

615
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,170
Last chance, sir.

616
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:30,337
Wait. I want to see this.

617
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:42,359
All right, show's over.
Ground units, move in.

618
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:37,039
He committed a crime. He's in jail!

619
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:39,295
- I can't just leave him there!
- Why?

620
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:41,544
You didn't see what I saw!

621
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,879
Look! Look, it's myeu-muh.

622
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:49,725
Where'd you find this?

623
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:51,136
The children's section.

624
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:53,643
I just wanted to show you
how silly his story was.

625
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,644
But you're the one
who's always pushing me

626
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:57,851
to chase down every possibility,
every alternative!

627
01:00:57,946 --> 01:01:00,187
I'm talking about science, not magic!

628
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,593
Well, magic's just science
that we don't understand yet.

629
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:05,233
Arthur c. Clarke.
Who wrote science fiction.

630
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,819
- A precursor to science fact!
- In some cases, yeah.

631
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:09,594
Well, if there is
an Einstein-rosen bridge,

632
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,102
then there's something
on the other side.

633
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:12,832
And advanced beings
could have crossed itl!

634
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:14,003
Jane.

635
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:17,131
A primitive culture like the vikings
might have worshipped them as deities.

636
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:18,914
Yes! Yes, exactly. Thank you.

637
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:27,843
You made my men,

638
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:30,391
some of the most
highly trained professionals in the world,

639
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:33,265
look like a bunch of minimum-wage
mall cops.

640
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:36,314
That's hurtful.

641
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:40,860
In my experience, it takes someone
who's received similar training

642
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:42,403
to do what you did to them.

643
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:46,525
Why don't you tell me
where you received your training?

644
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:50,496
Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan?

645
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:54,992
No, you strike me
more as the soldier of fortune type.

646
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:58,670
Where was it? South Africa?

647
01:02:00,175 --> 01:02:04,088
Certain groups pay very well
for a good mercenary like you.

648
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:07,841
Who are you?

649
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:15,228
One way or another,
we find out what we need to know.

650
01:02:15,607 --> 01:02:16,892
We're good at that.

651
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:23,987
Don't go anywhere.

652
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:32,946
Loki! What are you doing here?

653
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,781
I had to see you.

654
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:37,792
What's happened?

655
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:40,120
Tell me. Is it Jotunheim?

656
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:41,875
Let me explain to father.

657
01:02:41,967 --> 01:02:43,298
Father is dead.

658
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:50,805
What?

659
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:54,305
Your banishment,

660
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,474
the threat of a new war,

661
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:00,306
it was too much for him to bear.

662
01:03:02,988 --> 01:03:05,149
You mustn't blame yourself.

663
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:07,481
I know that you loved him.

664
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:11,152
I tried to tell him so,
but he wouldn't listen.

665
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:15,659
It was so cruel
to put the hammer within your reach,

666
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,706
knowing that you could never lift it.

667
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:23,288
The burden of the throne
has fallen to me now.

668
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:31,550
Can I come home?

669
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:35,467
The truce with Jotunheim
is conditional upon your exile.

670
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:41,933
- Yes, but couldn't we find a way...
- And mother has forbidden your return.

671
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,895
This is goodbye, brother.

672
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:51,237
I'm so sorry.

673
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:57,993
No.

674
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,163
I am sorry.

675
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:08,834
Thank you for coming here.

676
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:14,681
Farewell.

677
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:29,021
Goodbye.

678
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:31,033
Goodbye?

679
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:32,949
I just got back.

680
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:09,905
Sir?

681
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:12,155
He's got a visitor.

682
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:19,325
His name 1s Donald Blake?

683
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,243
Dr Donald Blake.

684
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:23,199
You have dangerous coworkers,
dr selvig.

685
01:05:23,503 --> 01:05:27,337
He was distraught when he found out
that you've taken all our research.

686
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:30,415
That was years of his life, gone!

687
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:34,677
You can understand
how a man could go off like that.

688
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:37,214
A big, faceless organisation like yours

689
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:39,219
coming in with their
jackbooted thugs and...

690
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:42,848
That's how he put it.

691
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:44,062
That still doesn't explain

692
01:05:44,149 --> 01:05:45,869
how he managed
to tear through our security.

693
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:49,442
Steroids! He's a bit of a fitness nut.

694
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:52,274
Sir?

695
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,284
It says here that he's an m.D.

696
01:05:58,538 --> 01:06:00,824
Well, he is! Or he was.

697
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:03,452
He switched careers
and became a physicist.

698
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:05,454
A brilliant physicist.

699
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:07,752
He's a wonderful man.
He's a man in pain.

700
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:13,042
Donny, Donny, Donny!

701
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:17,546
There you are. You're gonna be all right.
I'm taking you home now.

702
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,478
Dr selvig!

703
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:36,986
Just keep him away from the bars.

704
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:38,825
I willl

705
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:43,496
- where are we going?
- To get a drink.

706
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,164
Follow them.

707
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:53,752
You know, I had it all backwards.

708
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:57,335
I had it all wrong.

709
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:04,430
It's not a bad thing finding out
that you don't have all the answers.

710
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:06,685
You start asking the right questions.

711
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:14,853
For the first time in my life,

712
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:19,567
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.

713
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:23,578
Anyone who's ever going to
find his way in this world

714
01:07:23,665 --> 01:07:26,782
has to start by admitting
he doesn't know where the hell he is.

715
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:30,292
Thank you for what you've done.

716
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:32,795
No, don't thank me. I only did it for Jane.

717
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:37,046
Her father and I
taught at university together.

718
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:38,968
He was a good man.

719
01:07:39,973 --> 01:07:41,053
He never listened.

720
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:43,973
Neither did I.

721
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:47,310
My father
was trying to teach me something,

722
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,308
but I was too stupid to see it.

723
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,439
I don't know if you're delusional
or if you're pulling some kind of con,

724
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:55,860
I don't care.

725
01:07:55,947 --> 01:07:57,278
I just care about her.

726
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:01,070
I've seen the way she looks at you.

727
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:06,996
I swear to you, I mean her no harm.

728
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,250
Good.

729
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:12,911
In that case, I'll buy you another round,
and you leave town tonight.

730
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:19,925
Two boilermakers.

731
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:13,103
Kill him.

732
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:16,691
After all I've done for you?

733
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:23,691
So you're the one
who showed us the way into asgard.

734
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:26,196
That was just a bit of fun, really.

735
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:30,364
To ruin my brother's big day.

736
01:09:31,209 --> 01:09:35,043
And to protect the realm
from his idiotic rule for a while longer.

737
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:38,671
I will hear you.

738
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:46,555
I will conceal you
and a handful of your soldiers,

739
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:52,219
lead you into Odin's chambers,
and you can slay him where he lies.

740
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:54,353
Why not kill him yourself?

741
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:59,104
I suspect that the asgardians
would not take kindly

742
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,436
to a king who had murdered
his predecessor.

743
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:05,698
Once Odin is dead,
I will return the casket to you

744
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:10,779
and you can return Jotunheim to all its...

745
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:14,999
Glory.

746
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:20,963
Accept.

747
01:10:26,806 --> 01:10:28,387
What troubles you, gatekeeper?

748
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:33,635
I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim,
but could neither see you nor hear you.

749
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:35,553
You were shrouded from me,

750
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:37,809
like the frost giants
that entered this realm.

751
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:41,484
Perhaps your senses have weakened
after your many years of service.

752
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:43,232
Or perhaps someone has found a way

753
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:46,405
to hide that
which he does not wish me to see.

754
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,742
You have great power, Heimdall.

755
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:53,738
Did Odin ever fear you?

756
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:57,663
- No.
- And why is that?

757
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,003
Because he is my king
and I am sworn to obey him.

758
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:05,504
He was your king
and you're sworn to obey me now.

759
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:07,425
Yes?

760
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,266
Yes.

761
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:17,686
Then you will open the Bifrost to no one

762
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:20,607
until I have repaired the damage
that my brother has done.

763
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:37,365
Oh, my god. Is he okay?

764
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,701
He's fine. Not injured at all.

765
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:42,120
I'm sorry, my friend.

766
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:44,042
- What happened?
- We drank, we fought,

767
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:45,623
he made his ancestors proud.

768
01:11:46,093 --> 01:11:47,924
Put him on the bed.

769
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:02,732
I still don't think
you're the god of thunder.

770
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:05,563
But you ought to be.

771
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:18,156
Are these your chambers?

772
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:22,247
It's more of a temporary living situation.

773
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:26,923
I'm sorry. I don't usually have guests.

774
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:30,426
Actually, I never have guests.

775
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:34,759
That's not the right place for it.

776
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:37,429
I'm sorry.

777
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:41,558
Can we go outside?

778
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:43,851
Yes, of course.

779
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,651
I come up here sometimes
when I can't sleep

780
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:55,860
or I'm trying to reconcile particle data,
or when Darcy's driving me crazy.

781
01:12:57,123 --> 01:13:00,456
I come up here a lot, actually,
now that I think about it.

782
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:06,374
I'm really glad you're safe.

783
01:13:07,466 --> 01:13:09,957
You've been very kind to me,

784
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:12,885
and I've been far less grateful
than you deserve.

785
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:14,761
Well, I hit you with my car
a couple times,

786
01:13:14,849 --> 01:13:16,885
so I think that kind of evens things out.

787
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:21,143
Perhaps I had it coming.

788
01:13:26,986 --> 01:13:28,317
Oh, my god!

789
01:13:29,572 --> 01:13:30,903
I don't believe it!

790
01:13:31,157 --> 01:13:34,570
It was all I could get back.
I'm sorry it's not as much as I promised.

791
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:39,324
No, no, this is great! This is...
I don't have to start from scratch now.

792
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:40,996
Thank you.

793
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:47,081
What's wrong?

794
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:49,507
Shield.

795
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:50,923
Whatever they are,

796
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,068
they're gonna do
everything in their power

797
01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:56,845
to make sure this research
never sees the light of day.

798
01:13:57,016 --> 01:13:58,347
No, Jane.

799
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:00,846
Listen to me. You must not give up.

800
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:03,094
- You must finish what you've started.
- Why?

801
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:04,937
Because you're right.

802
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:06,772
Here, look.

803
01:14:09,362 --> 01:14:12,854
Your ancestors called it magic,
and you call it science.

804
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:16,191
Well, I come from a place
where they're one and the same thing.

805
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,381
What is that?

806
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:36,503
My father explained it to me like this,

807
01:14:36,597 --> 01:14:38,337
that your world

808
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:41,265
is one of the nine realms
of the cosmos,

809
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:44,344
linked to each other
by the branches of yggdrasil,

810
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:46,641
the worlds tree.

811
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:49,561
Now you see it every day
without realising.

812
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:52,894
The images glimpsed through...
What did you call it?

813
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:55,146
This hooble telescope.

814
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:58,574
- Hubble.
- Hubble telescope.

815
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:02,995
Tell me more.

816
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:05,072
So, the nine realms.

817
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:08,242
Now, there is midgard, which is earth.

818
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:10,077
This is alfheim.

819
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:13,085
Vanaheim. Jotunheim.

820
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:15,257
And asgard.

821
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:17,672
And that's where I come from.

822
01:15:35,114 --> 01:15:36,445
Thank you, Jane.

823
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:42,827
Our dearest friend banished,
loki on the throne,

824
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:46,280
asgard on the brink of war,
yet you've managed to consume

825
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:49,542
four wild boar,
six pheasant, a side of beef,

826
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:53,086
and two casks of ale. Shame on you.
Don't you care?

827
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:55,965
Do not mistake my appetite for apathy!

828
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:58,049
Stop it, both of you!

829
01:15:58,387 --> 01:15:59,387
Stop.

830
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:03,135
- We all know what we have to do.
- We must go.

831
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:08,060
We must find Thor.

832
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:10,231
It's treason.

833
01:16:10,483 --> 01:16:12,223
To hell with treason, it's suicide.

834
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:14,476
Thor would do the same for us.

835
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:16,902
Now shush.

836
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:20,732
Heimdall might be watching.

837
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:28,410
Heimdall demands your presence.

838
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:34,253
We're doomed.

839
01:16:34,507 --> 01:16:37,999
You would defy the commands of loki,
our king,

840
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:41,089
break every oath you
have taken as warriors,

841
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:43,512
and commit treason to bring Thor back?

842
01:16:43,682 --> 01:16:45,172
- Yes.
- Good.

843
01:16:45,768 --> 01:16:46,848
So you'll help us?

844
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:51,809
I am bound by honour to our king.
I cannot open the bridge to you.

845
01:16:52,525 --> 01:16:54,186
Complicated fellow, isn't he?

846
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:56,104
Now what do we do?

847
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:58,770
Look!

848
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:19,569
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know, sir.

849
01:17:19,593 --> 01:17:20,946
We got massive energy readings
out of nowhere

850
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:23,461
and then they just disappeared.
Fifteen miles due northwest.

851
01:17:23,556 --> 01:17:24,887
Let's go take a look.

852
01:17:49,874 --> 01:17:51,114
Thank you.

853
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:53,199
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

854
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:03,175
Base to team 2,
we've got activity outside the town.

855
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:04,377
Stay on your target.

856
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:16,222
Ensure my brother does not return.

857
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:21,731
Destroy everything.

858
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:33,914
Mom?

859
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,791
Is there a renaissance fair in town?

860
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:45,217
Call it in.

861
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:46,888
Yeah.

862
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:52,391
Base, we've got xena, Jackie chan
and Robin hood.

863
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:55,219
It's a beautiful theory, Jane.

864
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:59,223
But you won't be able to convince
the scientific community of any of it.

865
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:00,649
Not without hard evidence.

866
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:02,570
Found you!

867
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:10,572
My friends!

868
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:14,075
This is good! This is good.

869
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:15,664
I don't believe it.

870
01:19:16,126 --> 01:19:18,788
Excuse me.
Lady sif and the warriors three.

871
01:19:21,548 --> 01:19:23,084
My friends,

872
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:25,666
I've never been happier to see anyone.

873
01:19:26,053 --> 01:19:27,543
But you should not have come.

874
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:30,846
We're here to take you home.

875
01:19:32,393 --> 01:19:34,008
You know I can't go home.

876
01:19:36,397 --> 01:19:37,933
My father

877
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:40,098
is dead because of me.

878
01:19:41,068 --> 01:19:43,309
And I must remain in exile.

879
01:19:43,404 --> 01:19:44,610
Thor,

880
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:46,645
your father still lives.

881
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:05,005
Tell me, loki,
how did you get the jotuns into asgard?

882
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:08,709
You think the Bifrost is the only way
in and out of this realm?

883
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:10,404
There are secret paths
between the worlds

884
01:20:10,431 --> 01:20:13,138
to which even you, with all your gifts,
are blind.

885
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:16,388
But I have need of them no longer,
now that I am king.

886
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,139
And I say, for your act of treason,

887
01:20:18,439 --> 01:20:21,146
you are relieved of your duties
as gatekeeper,

888
01:20:21,275 --> 01:20:23,015
and no longer citizen of asgard.

889
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:26,101
Then I need no longer obey you.

890
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:49,500
Get somebody from linguistics
down here.

891
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:18,491
Was somebody else coming?

892
01:21:22,753 --> 01:21:23,788
Is that one of stark's?

893
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:27,463
I don't know.
The guy never tells me anything.

894
01:21:31,178 --> 01:21:32,418
Hello.

895
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:35,220
You are using
unregistered weapons technology.

896
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:36,467
Identify yourself.

897
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:41,229
Here we go.

898
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:45,977
Incoming!

899
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:55,031
Jane, you have to leave.

900
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,151
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm staying here.

901
01:21:57,413 --> 01:21:59,074
Thor's going to fight with us!

902
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:00,746
My friends,

903
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:05,159
I'm just a man. I'll only be in the way,
or worse, get one of you killed.

904
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:07,336
But I can help
get these people to safety.

905
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:09,671
Well, if you're staying, then so am I.

906
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:12,257
We'll need some time.
You'll have it!

907
01:22:12,886 --> 01:22:14,376
Okay, move it, people!

908
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:17,425
Everybody out! Use the back door.

909
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:19,423
Go, hurry! You can eat later.

910
01:22:32,114 --> 01:22:34,025
Keep it distracted.

911
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:51,129
For asgard!

912
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:27,502
Fall back!

913
01:23:44,186 --> 01:23:45,221
Go. Now. Run!

914
01:24:13,507 --> 01:24:15,998
Sif. Sif, you've done all you can.

915
01:24:16,343 --> 01:24:18,584
No. I will die a warrior's death.

916
01:24:18,845 --> 01:24:20,801
Stories will be told of this day.

917
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:23,798
Live, and tell those stories yourself.

918
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:27,934
Now go.

919
01:24:35,404 --> 01:24:38,362
You must return to asgard.
You have to stop loki.

920
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:40,025
What about you?

921
01:24:40,117 --> 01:24:42,608
Do not worry, my friends. I have a plan.

922
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:44,530
Come on.

923
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:50,916
We need to fall back. Come on.

924
01:24:51,003 --> 01:24:52,003
Come on.

925
01:24:59,886 --> 01:25:01,046
Wait!

926
01:25:08,979 --> 01:25:10,139
What's he doing?

927
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:40,674
Brother,
whatever I have done to wrong you,

928
01:25:41,011 --> 01:25:44,003
whatever I have done
to lead you to do this,

929
01:25:44,348 --> 01:25:46,179
I am truly sorry.

930
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:49,383
But these people are innocent.

931
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:53,853
Taking their lives will gain you nothing.

932
01:26:01,365 --> 01:26:02,855
So take mine

933
01:26:03,617 --> 01:26:04,902
and end this.

934
01:26:18,965 --> 01:26:19,965
No.

935
01:26:36,066 --> 01:26:37,397
It's over.

936
01:26:37,734 --> 01:26:40,066
No. It's not over.

937
01:26:40,654 --> 01:26:42,610
I mean, you're safe.

938
01:26:42,906 --> 01:26:44,692
We're safe.

939
01:26:45,075 --> 01:26:46,406
It's over.

940
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:53,656
No.

941
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,140
No.

942
01:27:39,004 --> 01:27:41,165
- We're spiking.
- Levels increase!

943
01:27:41,465 --> 01:27:43,126
Whosoever holds this hammer,

944
01:27:45,677 --> 01:27:46,677
if he be worthy,

945
01:27:50,056 --> 01:27:51,842
shall possess the power of Thor.

946
01:28:07,741 --> 01:28:08,741
Janel

947
01:28:11,244 --> 01:28:14,281
- no. No. No!
- Come!

948
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:38,727
Oh. My. God.

949
01:29:48,174 --> 01:29:49,539
So, is this how you normally look?

950
01:29:50,427 --> 01:29:51,427
More or less.

951
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:54,006
It's a good look.

952
01:29:54,514 --> 01:29:57,597
We must go to the Bifrost site.
I would have words with my brother.

953
01:29:57,684 --> 01:29:58,764
Excuse me!

954
01:30:02,689 --> 01:30:04,020
Donald?

955
01:30:05,108 --> 01:30:06,627
I don't think
you've been completely honest with me.

956
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:07,857
Know this, son of coul.

957
01:30:08,111 --> 01:30:11,103
You and I, we fight for the same cause,
the protection of this world.

958
01:30:11,197 --> 01:30:13,237
From this day forward,
you can count me as your ally

959
01:30:13,325 --> 01:30:16,317
if you return the items
you have taken from Jane.

960
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:18,072
- Stolen.
- Borrowed.

961
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:21,071
Of course,
you can have your equipment back.

962
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:23,327
You're gonna need it
to continue your research.

963
01:30:24,127 --> 01:30:26,413
Would you like to see
the bridge we spoke of?

964
01:30:27,589 --> 01:30:28,704
Sure.

965
01:30:30,383 --> 01:30:32,374
Wait, I need to debrief you!

966
01:30:39,601 --> 01:30:40,807
Welcome to asgard.

967
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:08,622
Heimdall, open the Bifrost.

968
01:31:16,346 --> 01:31:17,631
Heimdall?

969
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:23,182
Heimdall!

970
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:26,723
He doesn't answer.

971
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:28,976
Then we are stranded.

972
01:31:29,067 --> 01:31:31,979
Heimdall!
If you can hear me, we need you now!

973
01:31:32,904 --> 01:31:35,646
Heimdall! We need you now!

974
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:43,365
Heimdall!

975
01:31:57,929 --> 01:32:01,046
I must go back to asgard,
but I give you my word,

976
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:04,599
I will return for you.

977
01:32:12,193 --> 01:32:13,399
Deal?

978
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:28,289
Deal.

979
01:32:44,684 --> 01:32:46,800
Get him to the healing room!

980
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:49,810
Leave my brother to me.

981
01:33:14,672 --> 01:33:16,162
It's said

982
01:33:16,508 --> 01:33:21,172
you can still hear and see
what transpires around you.

983
01:33:22,514 --> 01:33:24,675
I hope it's true,

984
01:33:26,518 --> 01:33:28,679
so that you may know

985
01:33:29,687 --> 01:33:33,646
your death came at the hand

986
01:33:34,526 --> 01:33:35,857
of laufey.

987
01:33:44,953 --> 01:33:47,490
And your death came
by the son of Odin.

988
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:54,743
Loki!

989
01:33:54,838 --> 01:33:56,328
You saved him!

990
01:34:00,802 --> 01:34:03,088
I swear to you, mother,

991
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:05,636
that they will pay for what
they've done today.

992
01:34:06,015 --> 01:34:07,050
Loki.

993
01:34:07,809 --> 01:34:08,889
Thor!

994
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:11,805
I knew you'd return to us.

995
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:18,858
Why don't you tell her

996
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:22,562
how you sent the destroyer
to kill our friends, to kill me?

997
01:34:22,657 --> 01:34:23,657
What?

998
01:34:23,741 --> 01:34:26,153
Why, it must have been enforcing
father's last command.

999
01:34:26,244 --> 01:34:29,111
You're a talented liar, brother.
Always have been.

1000
01:34:29,747 --> 01:34:30,987
It's good to have you back.

1001
01:34:31,416 --> 01:34:35,000
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to destroy Jotunheim.

1002
01:35:16,586 --> 01:35:17,917
You can't stop it.

1003
01:35:18,004 --> 01:35:21,337
The Bifrost will build until
it rips Jotunheim apart.

1004
01:35:43,196 --> 01:35:44,356
Jane?

1005
01:35:46,324 --> 01:35:47,814
Why have you done this?

1006
01:35:48,076 --> 01:35:51,819
To prove to father
that I am the worthy son.

1007
01:35:51,913 --> 01:35:54,746
When he wakes,
I will have saved his life.

1008
01:35:54,832 --> 01:35:57,539
I will have destroyed that
race of monsters.

1009
01:35:57,627 --> 01:35:59,743
And I will be true heir to the throne!

1010
01:36:00,129 --> 01:36:02,120
You can't kill an entire race!

1011
01:36:02,215 --> 01:36:03,546
Why not?

1012
01:36:06,344 --> 01:36:09,586
And what is this newfound love
for the frost giants?

1013
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:14,011
You could have killed them all
with your bare hands.

1014
01:36:14,102 --> 01:36:16,184
- I've changed.
- So have I.

1015
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:19,429
Now fight me.

1016
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:24,271
I never wanted the throne!

1017
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:27,444
I only ever wanted to be your equal.

1018
01:36:28,283 --> 01:36:30,274
I will not fight you, brother!

1019
01:36:30,368 --> 01:36:31,778
I'm not your brother.

1020
01:36:32,537 --> 01:36:33,822
I never was.

1021
01:36:33,913 --> 01:36:35,403
Loki, this is madness.

1022
01:36:35,999 --> 01:36:37,614
Is it madness?

1023
01:36:38,459 --> 01:36:39,619
Is 117?

1024
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:42,285
Is 117?

1025
01:36:43,381 --> 01:36:47,374
Come on. What happened to you
on earth that turned you so soft?

1026
01:36:48,177 --> 01:36:50,884
Don't tell me it was that woman.

1027
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:54,096
It was!

1028
01:36:54,183 --> 01:36:58,301
Well, maybe, when we're finished here,
I'll pay her a visit myself!

1029
01:37:40,646 --> 01:37:42,557
Thor!

1030
01:37:49,322 --> 01:37:50,812
Brother, please.

1031
01:38:02,335 --> 01:38:03,495
Enough!

1032
01:38:47,296 --> 01:38:48,456
Look at you,

1033
01:38:51,134 --> 01:38:52,465
the mighty Thor,

1034
01:38:55,555 --> 01:38:57,716
with all your strength,

1035
01:38:58,391 --> 01:39:01,053
and what good does it do you now?

1036
01:39:02,395 --> 01:39:06,183
Do you hear me, brother?
There's nothing you can do!

1037
01:39:24,167 --> 01:39:25,452
What are you doing?

1038
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:30,537
If you destroy the bridge,
you'll never see her again!

1039
01:39:40,183 --> 01:39:41,844
Forgive me, Jane.

1040
01:40:20,348 --> 01:40:22,339
I could have done it, father!

1041
01:40:23,351 --> 01:40:25,182
I could have done it!

1042
01:40:25,603 --> 01:40:26,934
For you!

1043
01:40:27,647 --> 01:40:29,137
For all of us!

1044
01:40:31,317 --> 01:40:32,648
No, loki.

1045
01:40:41,410 --> 01:40:42,410
Loki, no.

1046
01:40:43,663 --> 01:40:45,824
No!

1047
01:40:50,086 --> 01:40:51,246
No.

1048
01:41:07,603 --> 01:41:08,934
It's gone.

1049
01:42:21,469 --> 01:42:24,302
And then, with a mighty bellow,

1050
01:42:24,555 --> 01:42:28,639
I flew into the giant metal creature
and laid him low!

1051
01:42:28,809 --> 01:42:32,393
Is that another way of saying
you fell on your huge ass?

1052
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:38,476
As a matter of fact, falling was a tactic
lulling the destroyer...

1053
01:42:52,667 --> 01:42:55,500
My queen, I'm so sorry for your loss.

1054
01:43:01,342 --> 01:43:02,673
How is he?

1055
01:43:05,012 --> 01:43:07,003
He mourns for his brother.

1056
01:43:08,349 --> 01:43:09,509
And...

1057
01:43:10,685 --> 01:43:12,266
He misses her.

1058
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:14,601
The mortal.

1059
01:43:31,038 --> 01:43:32,778
You'll be a wise king.

1060
01:43:37,211 --> 01:43:39,623
There will never be
a wiser king than you.

1061
01:43:41,048 --> 01:43:42,709
Or a better father.

1062
01:43:53,602 --> 01:43:56,765
I have much to learn.

1063
01:43:58,774 --> 01:44:00,264
I know that now.

1064
01:44:05,281 --> 01:44:07,237
Someday, perhaps,

1065
01:44:08,534 --> 01:44:10,445
I shall make you proud.

1066
01:44:18,085 --> 01:44:20,292
You've already made me proud.

1067
01:44:34,852 --> 01:44:36,843
So earth is lost to us.

1068
01:44:38,189 --> 01:44:39,189
No.

1069
01:44:40,191 --> 01:44:42,182
There is always hope.

1070
01:44:46,197 --> 01:44:47,687
Can you see her?

1071
01:44:50,618 --> 01:44:51,949
Yes.

1072
01:44:55,623 --> 01:44:57,534
I have the particle detectors!

1073
01:44:57,625 --> 01:44:59,707
Darcy, do you have the s.H.I.Le.L.D.
Satellite codes?

1074
01:44:59,794 --> 01:45:01,876
Yeah. Have you seen my taser?

1075
01:45:01,962 --> 01:45:03,372
How is she?

1076
01:45:03,464 --> 01:45:05,546
In the car. Come on, Jane!

1077
01:45:05,883 --> 01:45:07,965
She searches for you.

1078
01:53:17,541 --> 01:53:19,452
Dr selvig.

1079
01:53:22,296 --> 01:53:24,457
So you're the man behind all this?

1080
01:53:26,633 --> 01:53:28,624
It's quite a labyrinth.

1081
01:53:29,386 --> 01:53:33,299
I was thinking
they're taking me down here to kill me.

1082
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:43,472
I've been hearing
about the new Mexico situation.

1083
01:53:44,318 --> 01:53:47,981
Your work has impressed a lot of people
who are much smarter than I am.

1084
01:53:48,071 --> 01:53:50,062
I have a lot to work with.

1085
01:53:50,657 --> 01:53:53,945
The foster theory.
A gateway to another dimension.

1086
01:53:54,619 --> 01:53:55,619
It's unprecedented.

1087
01:53:58,332 --> 01:53:59,572
Isn't it?

1088
01:54:03,003 --> 01:54:06,336
Legend tells us one thing,
history, another.

1089
01:54:06,673 --> 01:54:10,882
But every now and then,
we find something that belongs to both.

1090
01:54:18,685 --> 01:54:19,685
What is it?

1091
01:54:19,770 --> 01:54:20,885
Power, doctor.

1092
01:54:21,438 --> 01:54:23,429
If we can figure out how to tap it,

1093
01:54:23,857 --> 01:54:25,347
maybe unlimited power.

1094
01:54:31,114 --> 01:54:33,355
Well, I guess that's worth a look.

1095
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:37,359
Well, I guess that's worth a look.
