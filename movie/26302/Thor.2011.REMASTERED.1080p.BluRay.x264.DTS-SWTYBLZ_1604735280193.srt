讓他們嚇破膽
Break their spirits

so they'll never dare try to cross our borders again.

126

你只是站在一個戰士的角度思考
You're thinking only as a warrior.

127

這就是戰爭行為
This was an act of war!

We will find the breach in our defenses and it will be sealed.

Not yet.

It's unwise to be in my company right now, brother.

135

這本該是我的榮耀之日
This was to be my day of triumph.

這是怎麼了
What's this?

139
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,150
如果這麼說能安慰你的話  
If it's any consolation,

140
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,480
我覺得你是對的
I think you're right.

141
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,140

About the Frost Giants, about Laufey, about everything.

142
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,950

If they found a way to penetrate Asgard's defenses once,

143
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,630
誰能保證他們不會捲土重來呢
who's to say they won't try again?

144
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,600
-下一次會帶著軍隊來  -正是
- Next time with an army. - Exactly.

145
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,730
但你的任何行動  都會違背父王的意願
There's nothing you can do without defying Father.

146

不不不  我瞭解這表情
No, no, no. I know that look.

147
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,700
這是確保我們防禦安全的唯一方法
That's the only way to ensure the safety of our borders.

149
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,480
發瘋  哪種程度的發瘋
Madness? What sort of madness?

150
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,100
我們要去約頓海姆
We're going to Jotunheim.

151
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,830
什麼
What?

152
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,000
這可不像去趟地球
This isn't like a journey to Earth

153
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,020
在那裡你只要稍稍召喚些閃電雷鳴
where you summon a little lightning and thunder,

154
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,110
人類就會把你當成神來崇拜
and the mortals worship you as a god.

155
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,120
這可是約頓海姆
This is Jotunheim.

156
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,720
我父王曾一路攻入約頓海姆
My father fought his way into Jotunheim,

157
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,860
擊敗了他們的軍隊  帶走了他們的遠古冬棺
defeated their armies and took their Casket.

158
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,380
我們只是去尋求回應
We would just be looking for answers.

159
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,050
這是被禁止的
It is forbidden!

160
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,130
朋友們  你們忘了我們一起做過的事嗎
My friends, have you forgotten all that we have done together?

161
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,290
范達爾  霍根
Fandral, Hogun.

162
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,400
是誰帶你們加入了最光榮的戰役
Who led you into the most glorious of battles?

163
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,810
是你
You did.

164
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,520
沃斯塔格  是誰給了你鮮美的佳餚
And Volstagg, to delicacies so succulent,

165
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,060
讓你覺得欲仙欲死  仿佛升入了英靈殿呢
you thought you'd died and gone to Valhalla?

166
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:27,590
是你
You did.

167
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,470
沒錯
Yes!

168
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,650
又是誰向所有認為
And who proved wrong all who scoffed at the idea

169
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,250
少女不能成為王國最威猛的戰士的人
that a young maiden could be one of the fiercest warriors

170
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,600
證明了他們的錯誤呢
this realm has ever known?

171
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,660
是我
I did.

172
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,810
的確  但我一直支持你  希芙
True, but I supported you, Sif.

173
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,350
朋友們
My friends,

174
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,100
我們要去約頓海姆
we're going to Jotunheim.

175
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:34,960
交給我吧
You leave this to me.

176
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,890
-好海姆達爾...  -你們穿得不夠暖
- Good Heimdall... - You're not dressed warmly enough.

177
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,370
你說什麼
I'm sorry?

178
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,330
你們以為能瞞過我嗎
Do you think that you can deceive me?

179
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,590
-你一定是搞錯了  -夠了
- You must be mistaken... - Enough!

180
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,830
海姆達爾  能讓我們過去嗎
Heimdall, may we pass?

181
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:56,810
從沒有敵人能逃過我的眼睛  直到今天
Never has an enemy slipped my watch until this day.

182
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,790
我想知道究竟是怎麼回事
I wish to know how that happened.

183
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,110
那就在我們回來之前
Then tell no one where we have gone

184
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,520
別告訴任何人我們的去向
until we've returned.

185
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,560
明白了嗎
Understand?

186
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,570
怎麼了  三寸不爛之舌打結了
What happened? Silver tongue turn to lead?

187
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,520
我警告你們
Be warned.

188
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,410
作為門衛
I will honor my sworn oath

189
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:03,580
我將遵守保護王國的誓言
to protect this realm as its Gatekeeper.

190
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,400
如果你們的歸來威脅了阿斯加德的安全
If your return threatens the safety of Asgard,

191
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,080
彩虹橋將不會為你們開啟
Bifrost will remain closed to you

192
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,560
你將被留在約頓海姆的寒冷荒漠中等死
and you'll be left to die in the cold waste of Jotunheim.

193
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,590
你不能乾脆為我們一直開著橋嗎
Couldn't you just leave the bridge open for us?

194
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,830
一直開啟
To leave the bridge open

195
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:18,050
會釋放彩虹橋的全部能量
would unleash the full power of the Bifrost

196
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,630
摧毀連你們在內的整個約頓海姆
and destroy Jotunheim with you upon it.

197
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,680
我可不準備今天死
I have no plans to die today.

198
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,800
沒人想死
None do.

199
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,890
我們不該來的
We shouldn't be here.

200
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,140
走吧
Let's move.

201
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,770
他們在哪
Where are they?

202
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,080
躲起來了
Hiding,

203
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,250
懦夫的慣用伎倆
as cowards always do.

204
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:34,790
你們這麼大老遠來送死  阿斯加德人
You've come a long way to die, Asgardians.

205
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,890
我是托爾·奧丁森
I am Thor Odinson!

206
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,520
我們知道你是誰
We know who you are.

207
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,240
你們的人是怎麼進入阿斯加德的
How did your people get into Asgard?

208
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,600
奧丁之家滿是叛徒
The House of Odin is full of traitors.

209
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,650
不要用謊言污蔑我父王之名
Do not dishonor my father's name with your lies!

210
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,870
你父親是個劊子手  是個小偷
Your father is a murderer and a thief!

211
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,440
你們又為什麼而來  來講和嗎
And why have you come here? To make peace?

212
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,210
你期待戰爭  你渴望它
You long for battle. You crave it.

213
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,270
你不過是個
You're nothing but a boy

214
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,150
想證明自己是大人的小男孩
trying to prove himself a man.

215
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:19,260
本"男孩"厭倦了你的嘲笑
Well, this "boy" has grown tired of your mockery.

216
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:28,150
托爾  三思而後行
Thor, stop and think.

217
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,770
看看你周圍  我們寡不敵眾
Look around you, we're outnumbered.

218
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,460
記住你的位置  弟弟
Know your place, brother.

219
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,100
你不知道自己的行為將導致什麼
You know not what your actions would unleash.

220
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,070
可我知道
I do.

221
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,990
走吧  趁我還沒改主意
Go now, while I still allow it.

222
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,510
我們將接受您最寬仁的提議
We will accept your most gracious offer.

223
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,830
走吧  哥哥
Come on, brother.

224
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,030
滾回家吧  小公主
Run back home, little princess.

225
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,470
該死
Damn.

226
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:27,920
誰是下一個
Next?

227
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,590
至少給我點挑戰嘛
At least make it a challenge for me!

228
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,720
這才像樣
That's more like it.

229
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,860
別讓他們碰到你
Don't let them touch you!

230
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,560
托爾
Thor!

231
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,340
-我們必須走了  -那就走吧
- We must go! - Then go!

232
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,140
快跑
Run!

233
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,060
托爾
Thor!

234
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,340
海姆達爾
Heimdall!

235
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,140
開啟彩虹橋
Open the bridge!

236
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,870
父王  我們一起消滅他們
Father! We'll finish them together!

237
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:22,980
閉嘴
Silence!

238
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,580
眾神之父
Allfather.

239
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,310
你看上去很疲憊
You look weary.

240
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,860
勞菲
Laufey,

241
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,670
就此打住吧
end this now.

242
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,360
是你兒子挑起的
Your boy sought this out.

243
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,120
沒錯
You're right.

244
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:48,370
這不過是男孩的胡鬧  別小題大作
And these are the actions of a boy, treat them as such.

245
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,340
你我可以就此做個了結
You and I can end this here and now,

246
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,150
不要引發進一步的殺戮
before there's further bloodshed.

247
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:56,510
事情已經超出外交範圍了  眾神之父
We are beyond diplomacy now, Allfather.

248
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,400
他會得到他想要的
He'll get what he came for.

249
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,000
戰爭
War

250
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,570
還有死亡
and death.

251
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,450
那好吧
So be it.

252
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,640
為什麼把我們帶回來
Why did you bring us back?

253
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,080
你知道自己做了什麼  挑起了什麼嗎
Do you realize what you've done? What you've started?

254
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,420
我在保衛我的家園
I was protecting my home.

255
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,190
你連自己的朋友都保護不了
You cannot even protect your friends!

256
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,910
又憑什麼保護這個王國
How can you hope to protect a kingdom?

257
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,930
帶他去療傷  立刻
Get him to the healing room! Now!

258
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,740
如果懼怕行動  王國就要滅亡了  
There won't be a kingdom to protect

259
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,240
還保衛什麼
if you're afraid to act.

260
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,570
約頓巨人必須像曾經懼怕你一樣學著懼怕我
The Jotuns must learn to fear me, just as they once feared you.

261
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,070
這是驕傲和自負  不是領導能力
That's pride and vanity talking, not leadership.

262
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,780
你忘了我教過你的一切
You've forgotten everything I taught you

263
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,040
戰士的耐心
about a warrior's patience.

264
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,900
就在你等待和忍耐的時候  
While you wait and be patient,

265
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,200
九大王國都在嘲笑我們
the Nine Realms laugh at us.

266
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,280
老路走不通了
The old ways are done.

267
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,210
你眼見阿斯加德衰落  卻只會誇誇其談
You'd stand giving speeches while Asgard falls.

268
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:05,830
你是個虛榮  貪婪  殘暴的孩子
You are a vain, greedy, cruel boy!

269
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:08,860
你是個愚蠢的老頭
And you are an old man and a fool!

270
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,440
是啊
Yes.

271
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,860
我是愚蠢的
I was a fool

272
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,830
以為你已經準備好了
to think you were ready.

273
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,070
父王
Father...

274
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,660
托爾·奧丁森
Thor Odinson,

275
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,770
你違抗了國王的明確指令
you have betrayed the express command of your king.

276
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,460
由於你的傲慢和愚蠢
Through your arrogance and stupidity,

277
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,440
和平的王國和無辜的生靈
you've opened these peaceful realms and innocent lives

278
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:44,560
將面臨戰爭的恐怖和慘景
to the horror and desolation of war!

279
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:54,380
你愧對這些王國
You are unworthy of these realms!

280
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,600
愧對你的頭銜
You're unworthy of your title!

281
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,710
你愧對
You're unworthy

282
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:05,490
你所背叛的愛你之人
of the loved ones you have betrayed.

283
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,000
現在  我要收回你的能力
I now take from you your power!

284
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,170
以我父親
In the name of my father

285
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,480
及祖父的名義
and his father before,

286
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,330
我  眾神之父奧丁  將你驅逐
I, Odin Allfather, cast you out!

287
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,870
不管是誰持有此錘  只要他配得上
Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy,

288
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,990
就將擁有雷神之力
shall possess the power of Thor.

289
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,540
法律上講  是你的錯
I think that was legally your fault.

290
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,090
去拿急救箱
Get the first aid kit.

291
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,830
幫幫忙  千萬別死
Do me a favor and don't be dead.

292
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,230
需要做心肺復蘇嗎  
Does he need CPR?

293
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,040
我可會做心肺復蘇了
Because I totally know CPR.

294
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,090
他從哪來的
Where did he come from?

295
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,020
你還好嗎
You all right?

296
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,230
錘子
Hammer?

297
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,360
錘子
Hammer?

298
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,390
我們看得出你喝高了  挺明顯的
Yeah, we can tell you're hammered. It's pretty obvious.

299
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,660
上帝啊  艾瑞克  看看這個
Oh, my God. Erik, look at this!

300
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,290
我們得在一切變化之前趕快行動
We have to move quickly before this all changes.

301
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,610
簡  我們得送他去醫院
Jane, we have to take him to the hospital.

302
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,920
-父王  -他好著呢  看看他
- Father! - He's fine, look at him.

303
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,120
海姆達爾 
Heimdall!

304
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,010
我知道你能聽見我  開啟彩虹橋
I know you can hear me! Open the Bifrost!

305
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,000
醫院  你去  我留下
Hospital. You go, I'll stay.

306
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:01,160
你  這是哪個王國
You. What realm is this?

307
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:03,280
艾爾夫海姆  諾恩海姆
Alfheim? Nornheim?

308
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,530
新墨西哥
New Mexico?

309
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:08,620
你膽敢用這麼小的武器威脅我  托爾
You dare threaten me, Thor, with so puny a weapon?

310
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,940
咋了  他嚇著我了
What? He was freaking me out!

311
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,590
下次你要電擊一個人的話
Next time you decide to taser somebody,

312
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,920
確保他已經在車裡了   好嗎
make sure he's already in the car, okay?

313
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,250
簡  走吧
Jane! Come on.

314
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:40,120
{\an8}縣醫院

315
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,100
姓名
Name?

316
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,950
他說他叫托爾
He said it was Thor?

317
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:47,570
托  爾
T-h-o-r.

318
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,350
你和他什麼關係
And your relationship to him?

319
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,560
根本不認識
I've never met him before.

320
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,050
直到她開車撞倒了他
Until she hit him with a car.

321
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:55,250
只是擦到了他  但她把他電暈了
I grazed him, but she tasered him.

322
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,430
沒錯
Yes, I did.

323
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,980
只是抽點血
Just taking a little blood.

324
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,980
你膽敢襲擊奧丁之子
How dare you attack the son of Odin?

325
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,200
快來幫忙
I need some help!

326
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,350
叫保安來
Call security!

327
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,880
保安速到三號急診室  馬上
Security to ER 3, stat!

328
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,250
你們打不過偉大的...
You're no match for the Mighty...

329
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,220
{\an8}舊橋市市界

330
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,450
你說這不是單純的磁暴吧
You don't think this was just a magnetic storm, do you?

331
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:34,440
看  邊緣處的透鏡作用
Look, the lensing around these edges

332
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,220
是愛因斯坦-羅森橋的特徵
is characteristic of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

333
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,210
什麼橋
A what?

334
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,290
-你不是科學專業的嗎  -政治科學
- I thought you were a science major? - Political science.

335
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,980
她是唯一的申請人
She was the only applicant.

336
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:45,010
愛因斯坦-羅森橋是可能存在的
An Einstein-Rosen Bridge is a theoretical connection

337
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,340
兩個不同時空的連接帶
between two different points of space-time.

338
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,400
就是個蟲洞
It's a wormhole.

339
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,880
-艾瑞克  你看到了什麼  -星星
- Erik, look. What do you see? - Stars.

340
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,920
對  但不是我們的星星
Yeah, but not our stars.

341
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,700
看  這是我們這象限
See, this is the star alignment

342
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,560
每年這時候的星體排布
for our quadrant this time of year,

343
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,100
除非小熊星座休假了
and unless Ursa Minor decided to take a day off,

344
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,270
否則這就是別處的星座
these are someone else's constellations.

345
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,680
快看這個
Check this out.

346
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,410
不  不可能
No, it can't be.

347
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,670
我想我有東西落在醫院了
I think I left something at the hospital.

348
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,160
這不可能
It's not possible!

349
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:48,020
{\an8}縣醫院

350
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:51,430
不知他是吸毒還是怎麼的  突然就發飆
He was on drugs or something. He just went nuts.

351
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,780
天啊
Oh, my God.

352
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,810
我剛把一件最重要的證據弄丟了
I just lost my most important piece of evidence.

353
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:07,730
又這樣
Typical.

354
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,920
-現在怎麼辦  -找到他
- So now what? - We find him.

355
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,610
你看到他在醫院都幹了什麼嗎
Did you see what he did in there?

356
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,370
去找他未必是個好主意
I'm not sure finding him is the best idea.

357
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:14,540
我們的資料無法說明
Well, our data can't tell us

358
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,880
處於磁暴之中是什麼感覺
what it was like to be inside that event,

359
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,940
但他能  所以我們得找到他
and he can. So, we're gonna find him.

360
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,770
好吧
Okay.

361
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,820
看來得找遍整個新墨西哥了  對吧
So we're gonna look all over New Mexico, right?

362
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,410
沒錯
Exactly.

363
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,090
什麼
What?

364
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,470
對不起  我發誓我不是故意老撞你的
I'm so sorry. I swear I'm not doing this on purpose.

365
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,820
我來  我來
I got it, I got it.

366
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,580
加油  搞定它
Come on, kick it in now!

367
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,690
拔起來了嗎
Did it work?

368
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,520
長官  我們找到了
Sir, we found it.

369
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:48,060
作為一個瘋子流浪漢  他太正點了
You know, for a crazy homeless person, he's pretty cut.

370
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,830
抱歉我電了你
Hey, sorry I tased you!

371
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,560
別動  別動
Excuse me, excuse me!

372
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,010
這是什麼
What is this?

373
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:08,950
{\an8}你好  我的名字叫唐納德·布萊克醫生

374
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,230
我前男友的
My ex.

375
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,980
很會和病人相處  卻不會跟我相處
Good with patients and bad with relationships.

376
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,550
只有這衣服合你身了
They're the only clothes I had that would fit you.

377
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,860
足矣
They will suffice.

378
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:20,820
不用客氣
You're welcome.

379
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,980
這具人類軀體變弱了
This mortal form has grown weak.

380
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,540
我需要進食
I need sustenance.

381
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,480
我們不該讓他去的
We should never have let him go.

382
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:47,160
沒人能阻止他
There was no stopping him.

383
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,430
他只是被放逐了  又不是死了
Well, at least he's only banished, not dead.

384
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,430
要不是守護
Which is what we'd all be

385
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,950
把我們的去向告訴了奧丁  我們可就沒命了
if that guard hadn't told Odin where we'd gone.

386
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,250
守護是怎麼知道的
How did the guard even know?

387
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,840
我告訴他的
I told him.

388
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,490
什麼
What?

389
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,130
我叫他在我們走後把這事告訴奧丁
I told him to go to Odin after we'd left.

390
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:09,630
他動作太慢了  該挨頓鞭子
He should be flogged for taking so long.

391
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,990
我們本該在到約頓海姆前被攔下
We should never have reached Jotunheim.

392
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,220
是你告訴守護的
You told the guard?

393
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,520
我救了我們的命
I saved our lives.

394
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,510
還有托爾的
And Thor's.

395
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,130
我壓根沒想到父王會因此放逐他
I had no idea Father would banish him for what he did.

396
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,950
洛基
Loki.

397
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,810
你得去找眾神之父
You must go to the Allfather

398
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:24,600
勸他收回成命
and convince him to change his mind.

399
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,380
我去了又能如何
And if I do, then what?

400
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,350
我比你們都更愛托爾
I love Thor more dearly than any of you,

401
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,670
但你們知道他是怎樣的人
but you know what he is.

402
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,250
高傲  魯莽  極其危險
He's arrogant. He's reckless. He's dangerous.

403
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,080
你們看到他今天的所作所為了
You saw how he was today.

404
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,860
這是阿斯加德的國王該有的樣子嗎
Is that what Asgard needs from its king?

405
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,140
他嘴上說是為了阿斯加德好
He may speak of the good of Asgard,

406
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,570
但他一直嫉妒托爾
but he's always been jealous of Thor.

407
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,460
我們得感謝他
We should be grateful to him,

408
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,710
是他救了我們的命
he saved our lives.

409
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,200
勞菲曾說
Laufey said

410
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,680
奧丁之家裡有叛徒
there were traitors in the House of Odin.

411
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:59,600
魔法大師有能力將三個約頓巨人帶進阿斯加德
A master of magic could bring three Jotuns into Asgard.

412
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:02,890
洛基一向喜歡惡作劇
Loki's always been one for mischief,

413
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:05,260
但你說的可是相當嚴重的事
but you're talking about something else entirely.

414
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:27,130
放下
Stop!

415
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,280
我被詛咒了嗎
Am I cursed?

416
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,860
沒有
No.

417
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,360
我到底是什麼人
What am I?

418
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:41,670
你是我兒子
You're my son.

419
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,840
此外呢
What more than that?

420
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,740
遠古冬棺並不是
The Casket wasn't the

421
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:03,040
你那天從約頓海姆奪來的唯一東西吧
only thing you took from Jotunheim that day, was it?

422
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,430
沒錯
No.

423
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:13,690
戰後
In the aftermath of the battle,

424
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:17,020
我走進神殿  發現了一個嬰兒
I went into the temple and I found a baby.

425
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,250
巨人族的幼小後代
Small for a giant's offspring.

426
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:27,880
被遺棄  很痛苦  等著自生自滅
Abandoned, suffering, left to die.

427
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,810
是勞菲的兒子
Laufey's son.

428
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,220
勞菲的兒子
Laufey's son.

429
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,190
沒錯
Yes.

430
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,140
為什麼
Why?

431
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,850
你殺約頓巨人無數  為何要帶我走
You were knee-deep in Jotuns blood, why would you take me?

432
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:48,360
你只是無辜的孩子
You were an innocent child.

433
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:52,610
不  你帶走我另有目的  是什麼
No. You took me for a purpose. What was it?

434
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,950
告訴我
Tell me!

435
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,940
我希望有朝一日兩族能聯合
I thought we could unite our kingdoms one day.

436
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,350
形成同盟  帶來永久和平
Bring about an alliance, bring about permanent peace.

437
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,470
通過你
Through you.

438
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,900
什麼
What?

439
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,900
但那一切都無關緊要了
But those plans no longer matter.

440
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,120
這麼說  我不過是又一件被盜紀念品
So I am no more than another stolen relic,

441
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:19,770
被困在此  等著某天派上用場
locked up here until you might have use of me.

442
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:20,960
你為什麼要曲解我的意思
Why do you twist my words?

443
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,220
你本可從一開始就告訴我我的身份
You could have told me what I was from the beginning,

444
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,580
你為什麼沒說
why didn't you?

445
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,730
你是我兒子
You're my son.

446
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:29,020
我只是想保護你  不被真相傷害
I wanted only to protect you from the truth.

447
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:29,740
怎麼
What?

448
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,550
因為我是孩子們睡前
Because I'm the monster

449
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:34,110
父母用來嚇唬他們的怪獸嗎
parents tell their children about at night?

450
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,100
-不是的  -現在一切都說得通了
- No, no. - You know, it all makes sense now!

451
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,830
為什麼多年來你一直偏愛托爾
Why you favored Thor all these years!

452
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:42,340
因為無論你怎麼說你愛我
Because no matter how much you claim to love me,

453
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,760
你絕不會讓冰霜巨人
you could never have a Frost Giant

454
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,570
坐上阿斯加德的王座
sitting on the throne of Asgard!

455
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,830
衛兵
Guards!

456
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,620
衛兵  快點  幫幫我
Guards, please, help!

457
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,730
你是怎麼到那片雲裡去的
How'd you get inside that cloud?

458
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:20,200
還有  你怎麼能吃了一整盒糕點
Also, how could you eat an entire box of Pop-Tarts

459
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,870
還餓成這樣
and still be this hungry?

460
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,060
這飲料  我喜歡
This drink, I like it.

461
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:29,930
是啊  很不錯吧
I know. It's great, right?

462
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:30,910
再來
Another!

463
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:34,890
對不起  伊奇  小意外
Sorry, Lzzy. Little accident.

464
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,810
-你什麼意思  -很美味  我還想來一杯
- What was that? - It was delicious. I want another.

465
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,910
-你可以直接說啊  -我說了啊
- Well, you could have just said so. - I just did.

466
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:44,000
不  好好說
No, I mean, ask nicely.

467
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,170
我沒有失禮之意啊
I meant no disrespect.

468
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:47,090
好吧  別再砸東西了
All right. Well, no more smashing.

469
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,320
行嗎
Deal?

470
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:51,960
我保證
You have my word.

471
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:54,130
很好
Good.

472
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,310
還要那些  伊奇
The usual, please, Lzzy.

473
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,450
你錯過了隕石坑那邊的精彩時刻
You missed all the excitement out at the crater.

474
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:03,420
他們說有個衛星掉在沙漠裡了
They're saying some kind of satellite landed out in the desert.

475
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,180
我們本來玩得很開心
Yeah, we were having a good time with it

476
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,650
後來政府的人來了
until the Feds showed up.

477
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:10,120
打擾一下  你們是說有個衛星墜落了嗎
Excuse me. Did you say there was a satellite crash?

478
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,040
是的
Yeah.

479
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:14,240
天啊  這個得傳到臉書上  笑一個
Oh, my God. This is going on Facebook. Smile.

480
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,350
那衛星長什麼樣
What did it look like, the satellite?

481
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:22,510
不知道是不是衛星  只知道很重
I don't know anything about satellites, but it was heavy.

482
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,320
沒人能拿得起它
I mean, nobody could lift it.

483
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:29,450
他們說它有輻射  我還碰過呢
They said it was radioactive. I had my hands all over it.

484
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:30,390
怎麼走
Which way?

485
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,510
從這往西50英里
Fifty miles west of here.

486
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:36,860
勸你別去浪費時間
Well, I wouldn't waste my time!

487
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:38,950
我們走時似乎全軍都出動了
Looked like the whole Army was coming when we left.

488
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:44,870
蠢蛋
Dumbass!

489
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:47,650
你要去哪裡
Where are you going?

490
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,130
-西行50英里處  -為什麼
- Fifty miles west of here. - Why?

491
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,610
去拿回屬於我的東西
To get what belongs to me.

492
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:53,340
這麼說那衛星成你的了
So you own a satellite now?

493
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,610
它不是他們說的那東西
It's not what they say it is.

494
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:55,330
不管它是什麼
Well, whatever it is,

495
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:57,520
看來已經被政府控制了
the government seems to think it's theirs. So,

496
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,170
你就打算直沖過去搶回來嗎
you just intend to go in there and take it?

497
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,050
是的
Yes.

498
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,940
如果你現在帶我去那兒
If you take me there now,

499
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,890
我就告訴你  你想知道的一切
I'll tell you everything you wish to know.

500
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:06,220
-一切  -沒錯
- Everything? - Yes.

501
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:07,610
等我拿回雷神之錘  你就能得到
All the answers you seek will be yours

502
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:09,090
你尋求的答案
once I reclaim Mjolnir.

503
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:11,310
咩咩  咩咩是什麼
Myeu-muh? What's Myeu-muh?

504
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:12,720
能跟你說句話嗎  簡
Can I have a word, Jane?

505
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,440
請別這麼做
Please don't do this.

506
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,050
你昨晚不也看到了嗎
You saw what I saw last night.

507
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:21,900
這不是巧合
This is no coincidence.

508
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,510
我們得查明隕石坑裡有什麼
We have to find out what's in that crater.

509
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,370
我不是在說隕石坑  我在說他
But I'm not talking about the crater, I'm talking about him.

510
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:28,190
-但他答應告訴我們真相  -他是瘋子
- But he's promising us the answers. - He's delusional.

511
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:29,470
聽聽他都在說什麼
Listen to what he's saying.

512
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:31,060
他說什麼雷神之錘
He's talking about Mjolnir

513
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,810
托爾  彩虹橋
and Thor and Bifrost.

514
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,940
這是我從小聽到大的神話
It's the stories I grew up with as a child.

515
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,940
我只是送他去  就這樣
I'm just going to drive him. That's it.

516
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,910
他很危險  簡
He's dangerous, Jane.

517
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:50,040
很抱歉  我不能送你去了
I'm sorry, but I can't take you.

518
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,570
那我們就此告別吧
Then this is where we say goodbye.

519
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,070
謝謝
Thank you?

520
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:05,490
簡·福斯特
Jane Foster,

521
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,340
艾瑞克·塞爾維格
Erik Selvig,

522
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:08,870
達西
Darcy,

523
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:10,690
再會
farewell.

524
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:15,710
好吧
All right.

525
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:17,640
回去幹活兒了
Back to work.

526
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,020
那是我的東西
That's my stuff!

527
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:46,410
這究竟是怎麼回事
What the hell is going on here?

528
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,130
福斯特小姐  我是神盾局的科爾森特工
Ms. Foster, I'm Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.

529
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:49,920
我應該知道那是什麼意思嗎
Is that supposed to mean something to me?

530
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:51,700
-你不能這樣做  -簡
- You can't do this! - Jane!

531
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,540
簡  這比你想的嚴重多了  別管了
Jane, this is a lot more serious than you realize. Let it go.

532
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:57,020
別管  這可是我的生活
Let it go? This is my life.

533
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,110
我們在調查一項安全威脅
We're investigating a security threat.

534
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:00,080
我們得徵用
We need to appropriate

535
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,830
你的記錄  還有你的大氣資料
your records and all your atmospheric data.

536
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:04,000
"徵用"是偷的意思嗎
By "appropriate," do you mean steal?

537
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:07,270
給  這足以彌補你的損失了
Here, this should more than compensate you for your trouble.

538
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:09,830
這些東西在睿俠可買不到
I can't just buy replacements at Radio Shack,

539
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:11,740
大部分設備都是我自己組裝的
I made most of this equipment myself!

540
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:13,070
那你肯定能重做一次
Then I'm sure you can do it again.

541
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:16,500
我肯定也能告你侵犯我的憲法權利
And I'm sure I can sue you for violating my constitutional rights!

542
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,800
抱歉  福斯特小姐  但我們是好人
I'm sorry, Ms. Foster, but we're the good guys.

543
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,980
我們也是
So are we!

544
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:24,670
我就快弄清一件很了不起的事了
I'm on the verge of understanding something extraordinary.

545
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:26,270
而關於這現象  我所掌握的一切
And everything I know about this phenomenon

546
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:28,400
都在這實驗室和這本子裡了
is either in this lab or in this book.

547
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:30,270
你不能想拿就拿...
And you can't just take this away...

548
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,110
簡  冷靜  冷靜  簡...
Jane! Easy! Easy. Jane...

549
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:38,940
多謝配合
Thank you for your cooperation.

550
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,380
多年的研究
Years of research,

551
00:46:58,810 --> 00:46:59,800
全沒了
gone.

552
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,430
他們還拿走了我的iPod
They even took my iPod.

553
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:05,690
-備份資料呢  -也被拿了
- What about the backups? - They took our backups.

554
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,660
他們還拿走了備份資料的備份
They took the backups of our backups.

555
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,540
他們做得非常徹底
They were extremely thorough.

556
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,880
我剛下載了三十多首歌
I just downloaded, like, 30 songs onto there.

557
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,090
你能不能別提你的iPod了
Could you please stop with your iPod?

558
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,060
這些到底是什麼人啊
Who are these people?

559
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:20,770
我認識個科學家
I knew this scientist.

560
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:23,490
是伽瑪輻射領域的先驅
The pioneer in gamma radiation.

561
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:24,860
後來神盾局出現了
S.H.I.E.L.D. showed up

562
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:29,400
他就杳無音信了
and he wasn't heard from again.

563
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:31,880
他們不能這樣對我們
They're not gonna do that to us.

564
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:33,350
我要去把東西搶回來
I'm gonna get everything back.

565
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,260
別這樣  讓我先聯繫下我的一個同事
Come on, please. Let me contact one of my colleagues.

566
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,120
他之前和這些人接觸過
He's had some dealings with these people before.

567
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,460
我給他發郵件  也許他能幫上忙
I'll e-mail him and maybe he can help.

568
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,940
你的筆記型電腦也被拿走了
They took your laptop, too.

569
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,780
眾神之父  我們有急事稟報
Allfather, we must speak with you urgently.

570
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:10,630
我的朋友們
My friends.

571
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,410
奧丁呢
Where's Odin?

572
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:15,560
父王進入奧丁之眠了
Father has fallen into the Odinsleep.

573
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:15,560
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}進入睡眠狀態進行恢復和治癒

574
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,900
母后擔心他將一覺不醒
Mother fears he may never awaken again.

575
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:21,680
我們要和她談話
We would speak with her.

576
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,800
她不肯離開父王床邊半步
She has refused to leave my father's bedside.

577
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:29,730
有急事你們可以直接對我說
You can bring your urgent matter to me.

578
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:38,560
我現在是你們的王
Your king.

579
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:54,490
王上  我們懇請您結束對托爾的放逐
My King, we would ask that you end Thor's banishment.

580
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:02,910
我的首個命令不能與父王的最後命令相悖
My first command cannot be to undo the Allfather's last.

581
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:07,640
我們就要與約頓海姆開戰
We're on the brink of war with Jotunheim.

582
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:11,500
人民需要看到子承父命
Our people need a sense of continuity,

583
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,600
才能在困難時期擁有安全感
in order to feel safe in these difficult times.

584
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,730
所有人必須齊心合力
All of us must stand together

585
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:19,960
為阿斯加德而戰
for the good of Asgard.

586
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:23,820
是的  當然
Yes, of course.

587
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,220
很好  那你們等我下令吧
Good. Then you will wait for my word.

588
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:27,870
容我
If I may

589
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:33,680
懇請陛下再考慮下...
beg the indulgence of Your Majesty to perhaps reconsider...

590
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,680
夠了
We're done!

591
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:18,620
{\an8}彩虹橋

592
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,120
{\an8}週四  托爾日

593
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:35,380
{\an8}寵物店

594
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:40,010
我要匹馬
I need a horse!

595
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,530
我們不賣馬  只有狗貓鳥...
We don't have horses. Just dogs, cats, birds...

596
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:47,670
那隨便給我頭能騎的就好
Then give me one of those large enough to ride.

597
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:50,490
你還需要搭便車嗎
Hey, you still need a lift?

598
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,530
我從未做過這樣的事
I've never done anything like this before.

599
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:02,070
你做過這樣的事嗎
Have you ever done anything like this before?

600
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,740
經常
Many times.

601
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:06,510
不過你有這個膽量
But you're brave to do it.

602
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:08,980
他們偷走了我的畢生心血
Well, they just stole my entire life's work.

603
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,820
我已經別無可失了
I don't really have much left to lose.

604
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:13,900
但你很聰明
Yeah, but you're clever.

605
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,510
比這個王國的其他人聰明多了
Far more clever than anyone else in this realm.

606
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:20,220
"王國"  "王國"
"Realm"? "Realm"?

607
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,800
-你覺得我很奇怪  -是的
- You think me strange. - Yeah, I do.

608
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:26,280
怎麼個奇怪法  是好還是壞
Good strange or bad strange?

609
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:27,970
目前我還不確定
I'm not quite sure yet.

610
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:34,590
對不起
I'm sorry.

611
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,320
但是  你是誰啊
But who are you?

612
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:44,590
說真的
Really?

613
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:49,100
你很快就會知道了
You'll see soon enough.

614
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:51,760
你答應告訴我答案的
You promised me answers.

615
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,150
你要找的是座橋
What you seek, it's a bridge.

616
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,970
愛因斯坦-羅森橋嗎
Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge?

617
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:00,700
該說是彩虹橋
More like a Rainbow Bridge.

618
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,230
老天  但願你沒瘋
God, I hope you're not crazy.

619
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:18,230
我真不習慣看到他這樣
I never get used to seeing him like this.

620
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:22,860
他已推遲了太久  我擔心...
He's put it off for so long now, that I fear...

621
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,920
這會持續多久
How long will it last?

622
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:30,480
不知道  這次不一樣
I don't know. This time it's different.

623
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:32,140
我們毫無準備
We were unprepared.

624
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,450
他為什麼要騙我
So why did he lie?

625
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:37,800
他對你保守秘密
He kept the truth from

626
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:40,440
是不希望你覺得自己是個異類
you so that you would never feel different.

627
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:43,150
你是我們的兒子  洛基
You are our son, Loki,

628
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,530
我們是你的家人
and we, your family.

629
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:49,140
我們不能放棄希望
We mustn't lose hope

630
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:51,630
要相信你父王一定會回到我們身邊
that your father will return to us.

631
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:54,420
還有你哥哥
And your brother.

632
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,850
托爾還有什麼希望
What hope is there for Thor?

633
00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:01,710
你父王做任何事都有他的用意
There's always a purpose to everything your father does.

634
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:36,050
這根本不是衛星墜毀
That's no satellite crash!

635
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:37,040
否則  他們會拖走殘骸
They would have hauled the wreckage away,

636
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,060
而不是在周圍搭建設施
they wouldn't have built a city around it.

637
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,250
-你會需要這個的  -什麼
- You're going to need this. - What?

638
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:43,930
等等  為什麼
Wait, why?

639
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,300
待在原地
Now stay here.

640
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:50,040
等我拿回雷神之錘
Once I have Mjolnir,

641
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,220
就把那些被他們搶走的東西還給你
I will return the items they've stolen from you.

642
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:53,730
好嗎
Deal?

643
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,390
不  看看下面的狀況
No. Look what's down there.

644
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:58,050
你覺得你能闖進去把東西奪回來
You think you're just gonna walk in,

645
00:53:58,050 --> 00:53:59,410
再大搖大擺地走出來嗎
grab our stuff and walk out?

646
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:01,260
不  我會飛回來
No. I'm going to fly out.

647
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,530
長官  偵察衛星的信號幾乎無法穿透雲層
Sir, feed from the keyhole can barely penetrate the cloud cover.

648
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:13,370
受這東西的干擾
Tech's barely working as it is,

649
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:15,790
設備本就很難正常運行
with all the interference that thing's giving off.

650
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,060
還有架商業飛機即將飛過上空
And we've got a commercial aircraft coming right over us.

651
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:21,980
西南航空5434航班
Southwest Airlines, flight 5434.

652
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,650
跟其他航班一樣  更改航線
Reroute it like all the others.

653
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:25,710
稍等
Hold a sec.

654
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:28,200
西側圍欄外有東西
We've got something outside the fence, west side.

655
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:29,760
德蘭西  我是傑克遜
Delancey, Jackson.

656
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,000
西側圍欄  去檢查一下
West side perimeter. Go check it out.

657
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:35,550
到了
There it is.

658
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:46,200
德蘭西  傑克遜  請回話
Delancey, Jackson. Report.

659
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,790
有人員受傷  圍欄遭到破壞
Agent down. We've got a perimeter breach.

660
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:13,940
我是艾瑞克·塞爾維格博士  有事請留言
You've reached Dr. Erik Selvig. Please leave me a message.

661
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:17,420
艾瑞克  是我  別擔心  我很好
Hi, Erik, it's me. Don't worry, I'm fine, but

662
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,310
但如果一小時內我沒聯繫你
just in case you don't hear from me in the next hour,

663
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:23,400
就到隕石坑來找我  好嗎
just come by the crater site and try and find me, okay?

664
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,250
我正在做你不讓我做的事情  對不起
I did exactly what you told me not to. I'm sorry.

665
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:27,850
非常抱歉  再見
So sorry. Bye.

666
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:33,770
B區  行動
Bravo quadrant, move!

667
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:48,460
已進入南側通道
Entering south tunnel!

668
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,870
不行  通訊中斷
Negative, negative. I have no comms.

669
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:07,740
發現目標  東側通道
Target sighted, east tunnel!

670
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:09,530
派一個人到高處  帶上槍
I need eyes up high, with a gun.

671
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:36,240
朝北去了
Moving north!

672
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:45,270
怎麼了
What have we got?

673
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:46,900
那玩意發出了
There's a massive electromagnetic surge

674
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:47,930
強電磁湧
coming off that thing.

675
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:49,520
系統幾乎無法承受
Systems are barely coping.

676
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,190
巴頓  請回話
Barton? Talk to me.

677
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:54,960
要我擊倒他嗎  長官
You want me to slow him down, sir?

678
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:58,560
還是要派更多人去被他打趴
Or are you sending in more guys for him to beat up?

679
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,900
稍後給你指令
I'll let you know.

680
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:16,050
你塊頭還真大
You're big.

681
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:18,450
但我打過更大的
Fought bigger.

682
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:04,540
快下令  科爾森
Better call it, Coulson,

683
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:06,750
我開始喜歡這傢伙了
'cause I'm starting to root for this guy.

684
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:28,700
最後的機會  長官
Last chance, sir.

685
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,950
等等  我想看看
Wait. I want to see this.

686
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:42,590
好了  表演結束  地面部隊出動
All right, show's over. Ground units, move in.

687
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:37,490
他犯了罪  他進了監獄
He committed a crime. He's in jail!

688
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:40,000
-我不能把他丟在那兒  -為什麼
- I can't just leave him there! - Why?

689
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,320
你沒看到我看到的一切
You didn't see what I saw!

690
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,150
快看  快看  雷神之錘
Look! Look, it's Mjolnir.

691
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:50,240
你在哪找到的
Where'd you find this?

692
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:51,350
童書區
The children's section.

693
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:53,870
我想讓你明白他的故事有多蠢
I just wanted to show you how silly his story was.

694
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:55,640
可你一直諄諄教導我
But you're the one who's always pushing me

695
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,410
要探索每一個可能  每一種解釋
to chase down every possibility, every alternative!

696
01:00:58,410 --> 01:01:00,600
我是讓你探索科學  不是魔法
I'm talking about science, not magic!

697
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,060
魔法是我們還無法解釋的科學
Well, magic's just science that we don't understand yet.

698
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:03,990
亞瑟·C·克拉克的名言
Arthur C. Clarke.

699
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,500
他是科幻小說作家
Who wrote science fiction.

700
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:08,450
-是科學真理的先驅  -個別時候而已
- A precursor to science fact! - In some cases, yeah.

701
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:10,070
如果確實存在愛因斯坦-羅森橋
Well, if there is an Einstein-Rosen Bridge,

702
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:11,510
那另一端一定有別的世界
then there's something on the other side.

703
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:13,660
更先進的生物可以穿過它
And advanced beings could have crossed it!

704
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:14,570
簡
Jane.

705
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:16,080
原始的維京人
A primitive culture like the Vikings

706
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,610
可能將他們敬為了神靈
might have worshipped them as deities.

707
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:19,960
對  對  沒錯  謝謝你
Yes! Yes, exactly. Thank you.

708
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,380
你把我的人
You made my men,

709
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:30,850
一些全世界最訓練有素的職業人員
some of the most highly trained professionals in the world,

710
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:34,180
比得像拿最低工資的超市保安
look like a bunch of minimum-wage mall cops.

711
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:36,770
這很傷人
That's hurtful.

712
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:39,150
根據我的經驗
In my experience,

713
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:41,920
得是受過類似訓練的人
it takes someone who's received similar training

714
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,390
才能像你那樣打倒他們
to do what you did to them.

715
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:47,040
告訴我你是在哪裡受的訓練
Why don't you tell me where you received your training?

716
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:50,980
巴基斯坦  車臣  還是阿富汗
Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan?

717
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,140
你看上去更像是雇傭兵
No, you strike me more as the soldier of fortune type.

718
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:58,800
哪裡的  南非嗎
Where was it? South Africa?

719
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:02,420
有些組織會花大價錢
Certain groups pay very well

720
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,210
雇傭你這麼優秀的傭兵
for a good mercenary like you.

721
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:08,030
你到底是誰
Who are you?

722
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:14,070
無論如何
One way or another,

723
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:16,040
我們都會得到我們想要的資訊
we find out what we need to know.

724
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:17,340
這我們很在行
We're good at that.

725
01:02:23,290 --> 01:02:24,340
別亂跑
Don't go anywhere.

726
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:33,500
洛基  你怎麼會來這裡
Loki! What are you doing here?

727
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:35,070
我得來見見你
I had to see you.

728
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:37,970
發生了什麼事
What's happened?

729
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,610
告訴我  是約頓海姆的事嗎
Tell me. Is it Jotunheim?

730
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:42,420
讓我去和父王解釋
Let me explain to Father.

731
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:43,600
父王已經死了
Father is dead.

732
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:51,110
什麼
What?

733
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:54,630
對你的驅逐
Your banishment,

734
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:57,610
戰爭再起的威脅
the threat of a new war,

735
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:01,400
讓他難以承受
it was too much for him to bear.

736
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:05,100
你不要自責
You mustn't blame yourself.

737
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:08,470
我知道你愛他
I know that you loved him.

738
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:11,560
我也勸過他  但他聽不進去
I tried to tell him so, but he wouldn't listen.

739
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:16,270
明知你已無法拿起雷神之錘
It was so cruel to put the hammer within your reach,

740
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:18,360
還放在你眼前  實在殘忍
knowing that you could never lift it.

741
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:24,380
現在王位的重擔落在了我肩上
The burden of the throne has fallen to me now.

742
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,810
我能回家嗎
Can I come home?

743
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:36,420
和約頓海姆的休戰條件就是永遠放逐你
The truce with Jotunheim is conditional upon your exile.

744
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:38,180
好吧  但難道沒有別的辦法...
Yes, but couldn't we find a way...

745
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:42,410
母后也不允許你回家
And Mother has forbidden your return.

746
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,120
我是來告別的  哥哥
This is goodbye, Brother.

747
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,330
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

748
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:58,450
不
No.

749
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:01,490
該道歉的是我
I am sorry.

750
01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:09,020
謝謝你來見我
Thank you for coming here.

751
01:04:13,970 --> 01:04:15,000
永別了
Farewell.

752
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,370
再見
Goodbye.

753
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:31,390
再見
Goodbye?

754
01:04:32,270 --> 01:04:33,440
我才剛回來
I just got back.

755
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:10,580
長官
Sir?

756
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:12,750
有人要見他
He's got a visitor.

757
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:20,080
他的名字是唐納德·布萊克嗎
His name is Donald Blake?

758
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:21,870
唐納德·布萊克博士
Dr. Donald Blake.

759
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:24,170
你的同事還真危險  塞爾維格博士
You have dangerous coworkers, Dr. Selvig.

760
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,550
他得知你們拿走了
He was distraught when he found out

761
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,950
我們所有的研究資料後心急如焚
that you've taken all our research.

762
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:31,850
那是他一生的心血  就這樣沒了
That was years of his life, gone!

763
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,780
你該明白  人遇到那種事都會爆發
You can understand how a man could go off like that.

764
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:37,570
像你們這種龐大的秘密組織
A big, faceless organization like yours

765
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:40,440
帶著一群穿長靴的暴徒闖進來...
coming in with their jackbooted thugs and...

766
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:43,450
他是這麼說的
That's how he put it.

767
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:44,470
這也不足以解釋
That still doesn't explain

768
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:46,660
他是如何突破我們的安保系統的
how he managed to tear through our security.

769
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:50,470
興奮劑唄  他特別喜歡健身
Steroids! He's a bit of a fitness nut.

770
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:52,580
長官
Sir?

771
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:56,300
{\an8}偽造信息

772
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:59,070
系統顯示他是個醫學博士
It says here that he's an M.D.

773
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,340
他是  他以前是
Well, he is! Or he was.

774
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:04,330
他後來轉行當了一名物理學家
He switched careers and became a physicist.

775
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:05,850
傑出的物理學家
A brilliant physicist.

776
01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:08,660
他是個很棒的人  經歷了很多磨難
He's a wonderful man. He's a man in pain.

777
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:13,360
唐尼  唐尼  唐尼
Donny, Donny, Donny!

778
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,500
你在這兒啊  你會沒事的
There you are. You're gonna be all right.

779
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,130
我這就帶你回家
I'm taking you home now.

780
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:33,850
塞爾維格博士
Dr. Selvig!

781
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:37,270
讓他別再靠近圍欄了
Just keep him away from the bars.

782
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:39,150
我會的
I will!

783
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,900
-我們去哪  -去喝一杯
- Where are we going? - To get a drink.

784
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:45,540
跟著他們
Follow them.

785
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,920
我全搞錯了
You know, I had it all backwards.

786
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:57,780
全錯了
I had it all wrong.

787
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:02,540
發現自己不知道
It's not a bad thing finding

788
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:04,580
所有的答案  並不是件壞事
out that you don't have all the answers.

789
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,630
你會開始問正確的問題
You start asking the right questions.

790
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:15,370
這是我人生中第一次
For the first time in my life,

791
01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:20,040
不知道接下來該幹什麼
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.

792
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:24,040
任何人想在這世上找到屬於自己的道路
Anyone who's ever going to find his way in this world

793
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:27,110
都得先承認他不知自己究竟身在何處
has to start by admitting he doesn't know where the hell he is.

794
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:30,950
謝謝你的幫助
Thank you for what you've done.

795
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:33,900
不  不用謝我  我這麼做是為了簡
No, don't thank me. I only did it for Jane.

796
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:37,520
她爸爸和我曾在一所大學教書
Her father and I taught at university together.

797
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,210
他是個好男人
He was a good man.

798
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:42,000
聽不進別人的話
He never listened.

799
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:44,110
我也是
Neither did I.

800
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:47,950
我父親本想教育我
My father was trying to teach me something,

801
01:07:47,950 --> 01:07:49,750
但我太遲鈍了
but I was too stupid to see it.

802
01:07:51,050 --> 01:07:52,430
我不知道你是有妄想症
I don't know if you're delusional

803
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:54,940
還是在耍什麼花招
or if you're pulling some kind of con,

804
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:56,030
我不在乎
I don't care.

805
01:07:56,830 --> 01:07:58,190
我只在乎她
I just care about her.

806
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,690
我看到她看你的眼神了
I've seen the way she looks at you.

807
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,800
我對你發誓  我無意傷害她
I swear to you, I mean her no harm.

808
01:08:07,810 --> 01:08:08,710
很好
Good.

809
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,440
這樣的話  我再請你喝一杯
In that case, I'll buy you another round,

810
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:13,630
然後你今晚就離開小鎮
and you leave town tonight.

811
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:20,270
兩杯酒鬼炸彈
Two boilermakers.

812
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:13,340
殺了他
Kill him.

813
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,360
都不顧我為你做了那麼多嗎
After all I've done for you?

814
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:24,400
原來是你指引我們進入阿斯加德的
So you're the one who showed us the way into Asgard.

815
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:26,470
說實話  那只是找點樂子
That was just a bit of fun, really.

816
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,110
為了毀掉我哥哥的大日子
To ruin my brother's big day.

817
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:32,920
保護我們的王國
And to protect the realm

818
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,940
能再晚些承受他愚蠢的統治
from his idiotic rule for a while longer.

819
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,030
我洗耳恭聽
I will hear you.

820
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:47,810
我會掩護你和你幾個手下
I will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers,

821
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:49,920
帶你們進入奧丁的房間
lead you into Odin's chambers,

822
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,870
你就可以殺了臥床的他
and you can slay him where he lies.

823
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:55,250
你為什麼不自己殺了他
Why not kill him yourself?

824
01:09:56,910 --> 01:09:59,690
我想阿斯加德人不會願意接受
I suspect that the Asgardians would not take kindly

825
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:02,620
一個謀害先王的國王吧
to a king who had murdered his predecessor.

826
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,480
等奧丁死了
Once Odin is dead,

827
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,610
我就把遠古冬棺還給你
I will return the Casket to you

828
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:10,920
你就可以讓約頓海姆恢復...
and you can return Jotunheim to all its...

829
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,240
昔日光輝
glory.

830
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:18,300
我
I...

831
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,610
接受
accept.

832
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,160
你怎麼了  門衛
What troubles you, Gatekeeper?

833
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:31,690
你在約頓海姆時  我試圖看你
I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim,

834
01:10:31,690 --> 01:10:33,840
但卻看不見也聽不見
but could neither see you nor hear you.

835
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:36,160
你被遮蔽了
You were shrouded from me,

836
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:38,730
就像侵入這裡的冰霜巨人那樣
like the Frost Giants that entered this realm.

837
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,060
也許你是任職太久
Perhaps your senses have weakened

838
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:42,170
感官退化了吧
after your many years of service.

839
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:43,710
也可能是有人找到了辦法
Or perhaps someone has found a way

840
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:46,880
隱藏不想被我看到的東西
to hide that which he does not wish me to see.

841
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:50,880
你有強大的力量  海姆達爾
You have great power, Heimdall.

842
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:54,770
奧丁曾畏懼過你嗎
Did Odin ever fear you?

843
01:10:56,610 --> 01:10:58,340
-沒有  -為什麼
- No. - And why is that?

844
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:01,980
因為他是我的國王  我誓死服從他
Because he is my king and I am sworn to obey him.

845
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:05,790
他曾經是你的國王  現在你要服從我了
He was your king and you're sworn to obey me now.

846
01:11:07,150 --> 01:11:08,040
對嗎
Yes?

847
01:11:13,390 --> 01:11:14,340
是的
Yes.

848
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,750
那就不准為任何人開啟彩虹橋
Then you will open the Bifrost to no one

849
01:11:18,430 --> 01:11:21,400
直到我收拾好我哥留下的爛攤子
until I have repaired the damage that my brother has done.

850
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,070
天哪  他還好嗎
Oh, my God. Is he okay?

851
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:40,170
他很好  毫髮無傷
He's fine. Not injured at all.

852
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:42,730
真抱歉  我的朋友
I'm sorry, my friend.

853
01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:44,640
-怎麼回事  -我們喝酒了  打了一架
- What happened? - We drank, we fought,

854
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,460
他給家族爭光了
he made his ancestors proud.

855
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:47,970
把他放到床上去
Put him on the bed.

856
01:11:59,330 --> 01:12:03,150
我還是不相信你是雷神
I still don't think you're the God of Thunder.

857
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:06,060
但你應該是
But you ought to be.

858
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:19,070
這是你的住所嗎
Are these your chambers?

859
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:22,630
說是臨時住所更合適
It's more of a temporary living situation.

860
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:27,720
抱歉  一般沒客人會來
I'm sorry. I don't usually have guests.

861
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:31,180
事實上  從沒來過客人
Actually, I never have guests.

862
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,110
放錯地方了
That's not the right place for it.

863
01:12:36,430 --> 01:12:37,880
抱歉
I'm sorry.

864
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:42,380
我們出去吧
Can we go outside?

865
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,720
好啊  當然
Yes, of course.

866
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:52,090
我睡不著時就會來這裡
I come up here sometimes when I can't sleep

867
01:12:52,090 --> 01:12:54,350
或是整理粒子資料的時候
or I'm trying to reconcile particle data,

868
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:56,680
又或是達西快把我逼瘋的時候
or when Darcy's driving me crazy.

869
01:12:57,690 --> 01:13:00,890
仔細想想  我其實經常來這裡
I come up here a lot, actually, now that I think about it.

870
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:06,710
真高興你沒事
I'm really glad you're safe.

871
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:10,320
你對我很好
You've been very kind to me,

872
01:13:11,210 --> 01:13:13,610
而相比之下  我的表現太不知感恩了
and I've been far less grateful than you deserve.

873
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:15,180
我開車撞了你幾次
Well, I hit you with my car a couple times,

874
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:17,260
我們算是扯平了
so I think that kind of evens things out.

875
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:21,590
也許是我活該被撞
Perhaps I had it coming.

876
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:28,630
天哪
Oh, my God!

877
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,530
難以置信
I don't believe it!

878
01:13:31,690 --> 01:13:33,400
我只能拿回這些
It was all I could get back.

879
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:35,160
很抱歉沒能兌現我的承諾
I'm sorry it's not as much as I promised.

880
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:37,630
不  這很棒了  這...
No, no, this is great! This is...

881
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:39,800
我不用再從頭開始了
I don't have to start from scratch now.

882
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:41,260
謝謝你
Thank you.

883
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:47,550
怎麼了
What's wrong?

884
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,070
神盾局  不管他們是什麼組織
S.H.I.E.L.D. Whatever they are,

885
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,460
都會盡一切辦法
they're gonna do everything in their power

886
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:57,190
使我們的研究無法得見天日
to make sure this research never sees the light of day.

887
01:13:57,540 --> 01:13:58,580
不  簡
No, Jane.

888
01:13:59,510 --> 01:14:01,820
聽我說  你不能放棄
Listen to me. You must not give up.

889
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,930
-要有始有終  -為什麼
- You must finish what you've started. - Why?

890
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:05,160
因為你是正確的
Because you're right.

891
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:07,150
來  你看
Here, look.

892
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:12,250
你們的祖先稱之為魔法
Your ancestors called it magic,

893
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:13,720
你稱之為科學
and you call it science.

894
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:14,990
在我的家鄉
Well, I come from a place

895
01:14:14,990 --> 01:14:16,770
它們兩者是同樣的東西
where they're one and the same thing.

896
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:32,570
這是什麼
What is that?

897
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:37,050
我父王是這樣對我解釋的
My father explained it to me like this,

898
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:38,790
你們的世界
that your world

899
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:41,810
是宇宙九大王國之一
is one of the Nine Realms of the Cosmos,

900
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:45,210
連接各王國的是世界樹的枝幹
linked to each other by the branches of Yggdrasil,

901
01:14:45,210 --> 01:14:46,750
也就是世界之樹
the Worlds Tree.

902
01:14:47,490 --> 01:14:50,350
你們每天都看到它  但不自知
Now you see it every day without realizing.

903
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:52,070
這些拍到圖像  用...
The images glimpsed through...

904
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,250
你們叫它什麼來著
What did you call it?

905
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:56,210
"呼伯望遠鏡"
This Hooble Telescope.

906
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:58,900
-哈勃  -哈勃望遠鏡
- Hubble. - Hubble Telescope.

907
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:03,280
再說點吧
Tell me more.

908
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,680
九大王國
So, the Nine Realms.

909
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:08,810
這裡是米德加德  也就是地球
Now, there is Midgard, which is Earth.

910
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:10,500
這裡是艾爾夫海姆
This is Alfheim.

911
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:12,280
這是華納海姆
Vanaheim.

912
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:13,960
這是約頓海姆
Jotunheim.

913
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:15,850
這是阿斯加德
And Asgard.

914
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:18,110
這就是我的家
And that's where I come from.

915
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:36,920
謝謝你  簡
Thank you, Jane.

916
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:43,330
我們的摯友被驅逐了  洛基登上了王位
Our dearest friend banished, Loki on the throne,

917
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:46,870
阿斯加德面臨戰禍  而你卻在這兒大吃大喝
Asgard on the brink of war, yet you've managed to consume

918
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:50,180
四隻野豬  六隻雉雞  半隻牛
four wild boar, six pheasant, a side of beef,

919
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:52,740
還有兩大桶麥酒  我都替你臉紅
and two casks of ale. Shame on you.

920
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:54,020
你就什麼都不在乎嗎
Don't you care?

921
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:56,780
別把我的胃口理解成冷漠
Do not mistake my appetite for apathy!

922
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:58,370
你們兩個  夠了
Stop it, both of you!

923
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:00,160
別鬧了
Stop.

924
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,990
-我們都清楚該做什麼  -我們得行動
- We all know what we have to do. - We must go.

925
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,360
我們得找到托爾
We must find Thor.

926
01:16:09,950 --> 01:16:11,190
那是叛國罪
It's treason.

927
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:13,030
去他的叛國  那是自殺
To hell with treason, it's suicide.

928
01:16:13,130 --> 01:16:15,300
托爾也會為我們鋌而走險的
Thor would do the same for us.

929
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:17,490
別說了
Now shush.

930
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:21,180
海姆達爾可能在監視我們呢
Heimdall might be watching.

931
01:16:26,510 --> 01:16:28,590
海姆達爾要見你們
Heimdall demands your presence.

932
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:34,660
我們死定了
We're doomed.

933
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:38,760
你們想違抗我們的國王洛基的命令
You would defy the commands of Loki, our king,

934
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:41,720
打破作為戰士曾許下的誓言
break every oath you have taken as warriors,

935
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:44,480
犯下叛國罪把托爾帶回來嗎
and commit treason to bring Thor back?

936
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:45,640
-是的  -很好
- Yes. - Good.

937
01:16:46,670 --> 01:16:47,820
你要幫我們嗎
So you'll help us?

938
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:49,980
我必須效忠國王
I am bound by honor to our king.

939
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:52,340
我不能為你們開啟彩虹橋
I cannot open the bridge to you.

940
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:55,110
這傢伙真難懂  是吧
Complicated fellow, isn't he?

941
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:56,430
現在我們怎麼辦
Now what do we do?

942
01:16:58,050 --> 01:16:59,040
你們看
Look!

943
01:17:18,820 --> 01:17:19,980
-剛剛那是什麼鬼  -我不知道  長官
- What the hell was that? - I don't know, sir.

944
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:21,600
剛才突然探測到了超強的能量
We got massive energy readings out of nowhere

945
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,810
然後又突然消失
and then they just disappeared.

946
01:17:22,810 --> 01:17:24,190
大概在西北方15英里處
Fifteen miles due northwest.

947
01:17:24,190 --> 01:17:25,260
我們去看看
Let's go take a look.

948
01:17:50,430 --> 01:17:51,370
謝謝
Thank you.

949
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:53,710
-謝謝  -樂意效勞
- Thank you. - You're very welcome.

950
01:18:01,030 --> 01:18:03,650
總部呼叫2隊  我們在城外發現異常
Base to Team 2, we've got activity outside the town.

951
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:05,170
盯住你們的目標
Stay on your target.

952
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:16,800
確保我哥哥回不來
Ensure my brother does not return.

953
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:22,120
摧毀一切
Destroy everything.

954
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:34,280
媽媽
Mom?

955
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:44,300
鎮上有文藝復興節嗎
Is there a Renaissance Fair in town?

956
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:45,580
報告總部
Call it in.

957
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,520
總部  我們發現了戰士公主西娜
Base, we've got Xena,

958
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:53,310
成龍和羅賓漢
Jackie Chan and Robin Hood.

959
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:55,520
這是很棒的理論  簡
It's a beautiful theory, Jane.

960
01:18:56,450 --> 01:18:57,050
但你別想
But you won't be able to

961
01:18:57,050 --> 01:18:59,720
說服科學界相信
convince the scientific community of any of it.

962
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:01,210
除非你有證據
Not without hard evidence.

963
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:03,700
找到你了
Found you!

964
01:19:09,630 --> 01:19:10,910
我的朋友們
My friends!

965
01:19:12,590 --> 01:19:15,240
太好了  太好了
This is good! This is good.

966
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:16,380
難以置信
I don't believe it.

967
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:19,710
容我介紹一下  希芙女士和三位勇士
Excuse me. Lady Sif and the Warriors Three.

968
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:23,150
我的朋友們
My friends,

969
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:26,180
我真高興能見到你們
I've never been happier to see anyone.

970
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,030
但你們不該來
But you should not have come.

971
01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:31,770
我們來帶你回家
We're here to take you home.

972
01:19:33,130 --> 01:19:35,090
你們知道我不能回去
You know I can't go home.

973
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:38,240
我的父王
My father is

974
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:41,080
因我而死
dead because of me.

975
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:43,460
我必須繼續被流放
And I must remain in exile.

976
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:44,940
托爾
Thor,

977
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,360
你父王還活著
your father still lives.

978
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:03,360
告訴我  洛基
Tell me, Loki,

979
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,880
你怎麼把約頓巨人帶進阿斯加德的
how did you get the Jotuns into Asgard?

980
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:07,600
你以為彩虹橋是進出王國的
You think the Bifrost is the only way

981
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,180
唯一途徑嗎
in and out of this realm?

982
01:20:09,190 --> 01:20:10,650
各個王國間有很多密道
There are secret paths between the worlds

983
01:20:10,650 --> 01:20:13,570
哪怕你天賦異稟也看不到
to which even you, with all your gifts, are blind.

984
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:16,940
但我已經不再需要它們了  我是國王了
But I have need of them no longer, now that I am king.

985
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:18,860
我宣佈  因為你的叛國行為
And I say, for your act of treason,

986
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:21,710
免除你門衛的職務
you are relieved of your duties as Gatekeeper,

987
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:23,720
你不再是阿斯加德的公民了
and no longer citizen of Asgard.

988
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:26,190
那我就不用聽命於你了
Then I need no longer obey you.

989
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:49,120
找語言學部的人來看看
Get somebody from Linguistics down here.

990
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:18,940
還有其他人要來嗎
Was somebody else coming?

991
01:21:23,150 --> 01:21:24,400
是斯塔克的嗎
Is that one of Stark's?

992
01:21:24,410 --> 01:21:27,960
不知道  他什麼都不跟我說
I don't know. The guy never tells me anything.

993
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:32,820
你好
Hello.

994
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:36,030
你正在使用未登記的武器科技
You are using unregistered weapons technology.

995
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,460
請表明身份
Identify yourself.

996
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:42,020
沒事啦
Here we go.

997
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:46,820
快跑
Incoming!

998
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:55,740
簡  你們快走
Jane, you have to leave.

999
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:57,950
-你呢  -我要留在這兒
- What are you gonna do? - I'm staying here.

1000
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:59,470
托爾要和我們並肩作戰
Thor's going to fight with us!

1001
01:22:00,150 --> 01:22:01,110
我的朋友們
My friends,

1002
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,280
我現在肉體凡胎  我只會礙手礙腳
I'm just a man. I'll only be in the way,

1003
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:06,000
甚至連累你們
or worse, get one of you killed.

1004
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,120
但我能幫他們轉移去安全的地方
But I can help get these people to safety.

1005
01:22:08,210 --> 01:22:10,350
如果你要留下  我也留下
Well, if you're staying, then so am I.

1006
01:22:10,810 --> 01:22:12,920
-我們需要點時間  -我們幫你爭取時間
- We'll need some time. - You'll have it!

1007
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,070
好吧  大家快走吧
Okay, move it, people!

1008
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,020
大家都出去  從後門走
Everybody out! Use the back door.

1009
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:20,150
快走  回頭再吃
Go, hurry! You can eat later.

1010
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:33,990
分散他的注意力
Keep it distracted.

1011
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:52,180
為了阿斯加德
For Asgard!

1012
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:28,310
撤退
Fall back!

1013
01:23:44,670 --> 01:23:46,310
跑  快跑
Go. Now. Run!

1014
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:16,800
希芙  希芙  你已經盡力了
Sif. Sif, you've done all you can.

1015
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:19,250
不  死也要死得像個戰士
No. I will die a warrior's death.

1016
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:21,070
歷史會記住這一刻的
Stories will be told of this day.

1017
01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:24,280
活下去  自己講述這段歷史
Live, and tell those stories yourself.

1018
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:27,950
快跑
Now go.

1019
01:24:36,030 --> 01:24:39,220
你們得回阿斯加德  去阻止洛基
You must return to Asgard. You have to stop Loki.

1020
01:24:39,290 --> 01:24:40,330
那你怎麼辦
What about you?

1021
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:42,860
別擔心  朋友們  我自有打算
Do not worry, my friends. I have a plan.

1022
01:24:43,950 --> 01:24:44,850
走吧
Come on.

1023
01:24:49,070 --> 01:24:51,200
我們快撤退  快走
We need to fall back. Come on.

1024
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:52,820
走啊
Come on.

1025
01:25:00,590 --> 01:25:01,440
等等
Wait!

1026
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:10,620
他要幹什麼
What's he doing?

1027
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:40,970
弟弟  不管我怎樣委屈了你
Brother, whatever I have done to wrong you,

1028
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:44,150
不管我做了什麼讓你這樣
whatever I have done to lead you to do this,

1029
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:46,880
我真的很抱歉
I am truly sorry.

1030
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:49,530
但這些人是無辜的
But these people are innocent.

1031
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:54,180
殺了他們對你沒有任何好處
Taking their lives will gain you nothing.

1032
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,150
殺了我吧
So take mine

1033
01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:05,330
然後到此為止
and end this.

1034
01:26:19,630 --> 01:26:20,560
不
No.

1035
01:26:36,610 --> 01:26:37,840
結束了
It's over.

1036
01:26:38,150 --> 01:26:40,410
不  沒結束
No. It's not over.

1037
01:26:41,110 --> 01:26:43,370
我是說  你安全了
I mean, you're safe.

1038
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:44,380
我們都很安全
We're safe.

1039
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:46,750
那就行了
It's over.

1040
01:26:53,090 --> 01:26:54,020
不
No.

1041
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:41,910
-出現峰值  -讀數上升
- We're spiking. - Levels increase!

1042
01:27:41,910 --> 01:27:43,660
不管是誰持有此錘
Whosoever holds this hammer,

1043
01:27:46,330 --> 01:27:47,710
只要他配得上
if he be worthy,

1044
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:52,630
就將擁有雷神之力
shall possess the power of Thor.

1045
01:28:08,210 --> 01:28:09,200
簡
Jane!

1046
01:28:11,790 --> 01:28:12,620
不
No.

1047
01:28:12,690 --> 01:28:13,440
-過來  -不
- Come! - No.

1048
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:14,950
-快走  -不
- Come! - No.

1049
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:39,070
天啊
Oh. My. God.

1050
01:29:48,820 --> 01:29:50,590
這才是你平時的裝束嗎
So, is this how you normally look?

1051
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:52,190
差不多吧
More or less.

1052
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,510
挺帥的
It's a good look.

1053
01:29:55,150 --> 01:29:56,890
我們得去彩虹橋的落點
We must go to the Bifrost site.

1054
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:58,360
我有話和我弟弟說
I would have words with my brother.

1055
01:29:58,360 --> 01:29:59,400
打擾一下
Excuse me!

1056
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:04,220
唐納德
Donald?

1057
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:07,080
我認為你沒對我說實話
I don't think you've been completely honest with me.

1058
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:08,670
聽著  科爾之子
Know this, Son of Coul.

1059
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:08,670
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}之前講的起名習慣
托爾以為科爾森的名字也是這個意思

1060
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:10,330
你和我  我們都是在為
You and I, we fight for the same cause,

1061
01:30:10,330 --> 01:30:11,690
保護這個世界而戰
the protection of this world.

1062
01:30:11,690 --> 01:30:13,910
從今天起  我與你結盟
From this day forward, you can count me as your ally

1063
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:16,900
但你得把你拿走的簡的東西還回來
if you return the items you have taken from Jane.

1064
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:18,330
-偷走的  -借用而已
- Stolen. - Borrowed.

1065
01:30:19,610 --> 01:30:21,450
好吧  你可以拿回你的設備
Of course, you can have your equipment back.

1066
01:30:21,610 --> 01:30:23,560
這樣你才能繼續你的研究
You're gonna need it to continue your research.

1067
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,380
你想看我跟你說過的那座橋嗎
Would you like to see the bridge we spoke of?

1068
01:30:28,070 --> 01:30:29,030
當然
Sure.

1069
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:32,800
等等  我還有事要問你
Wait, I need to debrief you!

1070
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:41,760
歡迎來到阿斯加德
Welcome to Asgard.

1071
01:31:07,150 --> 01:31:09,110
海姆達爾  開啟彩虹橋
Heimdall, open the Bifrost.

1072
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:18,150
海姆達爾
Heimdall?

1073
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:23,410
海姆達爾
Heimdall!

1074
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:26,950
他不回應
He doesn't answer.

1075
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:29,570
那我們就被困在這了
Then we are stranded.

1076
01:31:29,570 --> 01:31:32,930
海姆達爾  你能聽見嗎  我們需要你
Heimdall! If you can hear me, we need you now!

1077
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,940
海姆達爾  我們需要你
Heimdall! We need you now!

1078
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:43,980
海姆達爾
Heimdall!

1079
01:31:58,450 --> 01:32:01,390
我必須回阿斯加德去  但我向你保證
I must go back to Asgard, but I give you my word,

1080
01:32:02,830 --> 01:32:04,970
我會回來找你的
I will return for you.

1081
01:32:12,770 --> 01:32:13,670
好嗎
Deal?

1082
01:32:27,690 --> 01:32:28,590
好的
Deal.

1083
01:32:45,230 --> 01:32:46,880
帶他去療傷
Get him to the healing room!

1084
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:50,230
我去找我弟弟
Leave my brother to me.

1085
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:16,500
據說
It's said

1086
01:33:17,190 --> 01:33:22,150
你依然能看見  聽見周遭發生的事情
you can still hear and see what transpires around you.

1087
01:33:23,150 --> 01:33:24,990
希望這是真的
I hope it's true,

1088
01:33:27,020 --> 01:33:28,890
那樣你就會知道
so that you may know

1089
01:33:29,970 --> 01:33:33,900
你是死在
your death came at the hand

1090
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:36,760
勞菲手裡
of Laufey.

1091
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:48,080
而你是死在奧丁之子手裡
And your death came by the son of Odin.

1092
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:54,880
洛基
Loki!

1093
01:33:55,370 --> 01:33:56,810
你救了你父王
You saved him!

1094
01:34:01,450 --> 01:34:03,070
我向你發誓  母后
I swear to you, Mother,

1095
01:34:03,570 --> 01:34:06,180
他們會為今天的所作所為付出代價
that they will pay for what they've done today.

1096
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:07,450
洛基
Loki.

1097
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:09,230
托爾
Thor!

1098
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:11,990
我就知道你會回來的
I knew you'd return to us.

1099
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:19,410
你為什麼不告訴她
Why don't you tell her

1100
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:23,260
你是怎麼派毀滅者去殺我和我們的朋友
how you sent the Destroyer to kill our friends, to kill me?

1101
01:34:23,260 --> 01:34:24,140
什麼
What?

1102
01:34:24,270 --> 01:34:26,990
它一定是執行了父王最後的命令
Why, it must have been enforcing Father's last command.

1103
01:34:26,990 --> 01:34:30,060
你是個厲害的騙子  一直都是
You're a talented liar, Brother. Always have been.

1104
01:34:30,390 --> 01:34:31,740
你回來了真好
It's good to have you back.

1105
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:35,310
失陪了  我得去摧毀約頓海姆
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to destroy Jotunheim.

1106
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:18,700
你阻止不了的
You can't stop it.

1107
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:22,250
彩虹橋會一直開啟到約頓海姆被撕碎
The Bifrost will build until it rips Jotunheim apart.

1108
01:35:43,850 --> 01:35:44,780
簡
Jane?

1109
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,650
你為什麼這麼做
Why have you done this?

1110
01:35:48,730 --> 01:35:51,880
證明給父王看  我才是他的好兒子
To prove to Father that I am the worthy son.

1111
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:55,200
等他醒來時  是我救了他命
When he wakes, I will have saved his life.

1112
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:58,250
還殺死了那一族的怪物
I will have destroyed that race of monsters.

1113
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:00,800
我會成為王位的真正繼承人
And I will be true heir to the throne!

1114
01:36:00,820 --> 01:36:02,850
你不能消滅一整個種族
You can't kill an entire race!

1115
01:36:02,850 --> 01:36:03,840
為什麼不能
Why not?

1116
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:10,440
你怎麼對冰霜巨人突然產生好感了
And what is this newfound love for the Frost Giants?

1117
01:36:11,180 --> 01:36:14,710
你以前可是會赤手空拳把他們殺光
You could have killed them all with your bare hands.

1118
01:36:14,710 --> 01:36:16,770
-我變了  -我也是
- I've changed. - So have I.

1119
01:36:18,620 --> 01:36:19,640
來打我啊
Now fight me.

1120
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:24,760
我從來沒想要王位
I never wanted the throne!

1121
01:36:26,270 --> 01:36:28,580
我只想得到和你一樣的對待
I only ever wanted to be your equal.

1122
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,820
我不會和你打的  弟弟
I will not fight you, Brother!

1123
01:36:30,820 --> 01:36:32,060
我不是你弟弟
I'm not your brother.

1124
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:34,460
從來都不是
I never was.

1125
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:36,160
洛基  這簡直瘋了
Loki, this is madness.

1126
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:37,610
是嗎
Is it madness?

1127
01:36:39,150 --> 01:36:40,100
瘋狂嗎
Is it?

1128
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:42,700
瘋狂嗎
Is it?

1129
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:45,550
拜託  你在地球上遭遇了什麼
Come on. What happened to you on Earth

1130
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:47,760
把你變得這麼懦弱
that turned you so soft?

1131
01:36:48,620 --> 01:36:50,160
別跟我說是因為那個女人
Don't tell me it was that woman.

1132
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:54,480
還真是
It was!

1133
01:36:54,770 --> 01:36:57,210
也許  等我們結束了這一切
Well, maybe, when we're finished here,

1134
01:36:57,300 --> 01:36:59,580
我會親自去看看她
I'll pay her a visit myself!

1135
01:37:41,210 --> 01:37:42,170
托爾
Thor!

1136
01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:51,260
哥哥  救我
Brother, please.

1137
01:38:02,740 --> 01:38:03,880
夠了
Enough!

1138
01:38:48,050 --> 01:38:49,130
看看你
Look at you,

1139
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:53,070
強大的托爾
the Mighty Thor,

1140
01:38:56,150 --> 01:38:58,020
力大無窮
with all your strength,

1141
01:38:59,170 --> 01:39:01,140
現在對你又有何用
and what good does it do you now?

1142
01:39:03,030 --> 01:39:06,570
你聽到了嗎  哥哥  你什麼都做不了
Do you hear me, Brother? There's nothing you can do!

1143
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:26,150
你在幹什麼
What are you doing?

1144
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:30,990
如果你毀了彩虹橋  你就再也見不到她了
If you destroy the bridge, you'll never see her again!

1145
01:39:40,780 --> 01:39:42,080
原諒我  簡
Forgive me, Jane.

1146
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:22,520
我本可以做到的  父王
I could have done it, Father!

1147
01:40:23,980 --> 01:40:25,370
我本可以做到的
I could have done it!

1148
01:40:26,390 --> 01:40:27,390
為了你
For you!

1149
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:29,610
為了大家
For all of us!

1150
01:40:31,830 --> 01:40:32,920
不  洛基
No, Loki.

1151
01:40:42,030 --> 01:40:43,250
洛基  不要
Loki, no.

1152
01:40:44,210 --> 01:40:46,220
不
No!

1153
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:51,740
不
No.

1154
01:41:08,150 --> 01:41:09,170
結束了
It's gone.

1155
01:42:22,030 --> 01:42:24,950
然後  我一聲大吼
And then, with a mighty bellow,

1156
01:42:25,130 --> 01:42:29,880
飛進了鐵巨人的體內  把他放倒了
I flew into the giant metal creature and laid him low!

1157
01:42:30,020 --> 01:42:32,930
那是摔了個四腳朝天的意思嗎
Is that another way of saying you fell on your huge ass?

1158
01:42:32,930 --> 01:42:34,320
事實上
As a matter of fact,

1159
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:39,310
摔倒只是蒙蔽毀滅者的策略
falling was a tactic lulling the Destroyer...

1160
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:55,780
王后陛下  您兒子的事我很遺憾
My Queen, I'm so sorry for your loss.

1161
01:43:01,910 --> 01:43:02,950
他怎麼樣了
How is he?

1162
01:43:05,550 --> 01:43:07,220
他在悼念他的弟弟
He mourns for his brother.

1163
01:43:08,970 --> 01:43:09,950
還有...
And...

1164
01:43:11,310 --> 01:43:12,510
他思念她
He misses her.

1165
01:43:13,870 --> 01:43:14,850
那個凡人
The mortal.

1166
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:33,160
你將會是個明君
You'll be a wise king.

1167
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:40,100
不會再有比你更賢明的君主
There will never be a wiser king than you.

1168
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:42,820
和更完美的父親了
Or a better father.

1169
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:57,460
我有很多要學的
I have much to learn.

1170
01:43:59,380 --> 01:44:00,410
我現在知道了
I know that now.

1171
01:44:05,970 --> 01:44:07,480
也許有一天  
Someday, perhaps,

1172
01:44:09,270 --> 01:44:10,760
我會讓你以我為傲
I shall make you proud.

1173
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:20,230
你已經讓我驕傲了
You've already made me proud.

1174
01:44:35,270 --> 01:44:37,060
我們再也到不了地球了
So Earth is lost to us.

1175
01:44:38,630 --> 01:44:39,540
不
No.

1176
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:42,260
希望總是有的
There is always hope.

1177
01:44:46,710 --> 01:44:47,850
你能看到她嗎
Can you see her?

1178
01:44:51,150 --> 01:44:52,160
能
Yes.

1179
01:44:56,310 --> 01:44:58,030
我拿了粒子探測儀
I have the particle detectors!

1180
01:44:58,040 --> 01:45:00,390
達西  你拿神盾局的衛星密碼了嗎
Darcy, do you have the S.H.I.E.L.D. satellite codes?

1181
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:02,560
嗯  你看見我的電擊槍了嗎
Yeah. Have you seen my Taser?

1182
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:03,610
她還好嗎
How is she?

1183
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:06,300
上車  走吧  簡
In the car. Come on, Jane!

1184
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:08,410
她在找你
She searches for you.

1185
01:46:54,300 --> 01:47:00,100
{\an5}雷    神

1186
01:53:18,050 --> 01:53:19,600
塞爾維格博士
Dr. Selvig.

1187
01:53:22,980 --> 01:53:24,710
你就是那個幕後主腦嗎
So you're the man behind all this?

1188
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:28,770
這裡像個迷宮
It's quite a labyrinth.

1189
01:53:29,990 --> 01:53:33,800
我還以為他們要帶我來殺了我
I was thinking they're taking me down here to kill me.

1190
01:53:41,100 --> 01:53:43,970
我聽說了新墨西哥州的事
I've been hearing about the New Mexico situation.

1191
01:53:44,990 --> 01:53:46,860
你的工作讓很多比我聰明的人
Your work has impressed a lot of people

1192
01:53:46,860 --> 01:53:48,650
非常傾佩
who are much smarter than I am.

1193
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:50,460
我手裡的資料多
I have a lot to work with.

1194
01:53:51,260 --> 01:53:54,740
福斯特的理論  通往另一個世界的通道
The Foster Theory. A gateway to another dimension.

1195
01:53:55,210 --> 01:53:56,460
這是前所未有的
It's unprecedented.

1196
01:53:58,980 --> 01:53:59,900
不是嗎
Isn't it?

1197
01:54:03,510 --> 01:54:06,820
傳說和歷史之間總是有區別
Legend tells us one thing, history, another.

1198
01:54:07,210 --> 01:54:08,180
但也有時候
But every now and then,

1199
01:54:08,190 --> 01:54:11,140
兩者會發生重疊
we find something that belongs to both.

1200
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:20,430
這是什麼
What is it?

1201
01:54:20,430 --> 01:54:21,700
力量  博士
Power, Doctor.

1202
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:23,920
如果我們能弄清怎麼利用它
If we can figure out how to tap it,

1203
01:54:24,420 --> 01:54:26,370
也許就能擁有無盡的力量
maybe unlimited power.

1204
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:33,910
我想這值得一試
Well, I guess that's worth a look.

1205
01:54:35,740 --> 01:54:37,760
我想這值得一試
Well, I guess that's worth a look.
