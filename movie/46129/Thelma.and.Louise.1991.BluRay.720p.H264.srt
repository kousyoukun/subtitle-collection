00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,104
Well, I guess
18’s kind of young.

(TRUCK HORN BLARING)

770
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:26,152
But we’d already been
going out four years
when we got married.

771
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:28,654
Out for how long?
Four years.

772
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,782
I never been with
anybody but Darryl.

773
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:33,743
Oh, I’m sorry.

774
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:36,954
Well, if you don’t
mind me saying so,

775
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,831
he sounds like
a real asshole.

776

It’s okay.

777
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:45,838
He is an asshole.
Most of the time,
I just let it slide.

778
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:51,677
You better slow down
there, Ms. Louise.
That’s a cop up ahead.

779
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:53,679
Shit.

780
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:32,301

too many parking tickets.

on your way, all right?

783
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,223
All right.

784
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:48,067
Prints on the trunk
of the car match those
of Thelma Dickinson.

785
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,569
I’ll be damned.
Isn’t that strange?

786
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,863
And the husband says
a gun is missing.

787
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,366
She took a lot of stuff.

788
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:59,412
It looks like
she may be planning on
being gone a while.

789
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,122
The strange thing is

790
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:04,750
her husband said
she would never
touch that gun.

791
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:08,546
He got it for her
’cause he’s out late a lot,

792
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:12,883
but he said
she’d never touch it,
wouldn’t learn to shoot it.

793
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,677
Just kept it in
a drawer for years.

794
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,053
What kind of gun was it?

795
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,263
.38.

796
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,015
Right. Where are they?

797
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:22,810
They were on their way
to some guy’s cabin
and they never showed up.

798
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,691
All right. Now,
I’m gonna go and…

799
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:31,193
Listen up, you two.
I’m gonna go in. It’s
just gonna take a minute.

800
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:34,071
You two better
say your goodbyes,
you understand?

801
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,448
Okay.

802
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:41,871
Hi.
Hi.

803
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:44,623
I’m here to pick up
a money order
for Louise Sawyer.

804
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,336
There’s nothing.

805
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,799
How about “Peaches”?
Could you try
code word “Peaches”?

806
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,635
Did I hear somebody
say “Peaches”?

807

Oh, my God. Jimmy.

808

That’s the secret word.

I just came
to see you, baby.

812
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,444
Can I have
another room, please?

813
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:15,488
Put it on
my credit card.

Thelma? Thelma,
get your foot down.

815
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:28,751
Thelma, look who’s here.

816
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:32,254
Oh! Shit! Jimmy.
Hi, stranger.

817
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,256
What in the world
are you doing here?

818
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:37,176
Ask me no questions
and I’ll tell you no lies.

819
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:40,179
Good answer.
Same goes
double for me.

This is J. D.
How’d do?

822

(STAMMERING)
He’s a student.
He’s gone.

823
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:49,230
We’re just giving him
a ride to here, then he…

824
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,774
Louise said that
he would have to go, so…
LOUISE: He’s gone.

825
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,192
I guess that’s
what he’s doing.

826
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:54,693
Yeah, I reckon
that’s what I’m doing.

827
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,153
He’s gone.
Like the wind.

828
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,239
Have a good trip.
Thank you.

829
00:51:58,323 --> 00:51:59,782
Nice meeting you.

830
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,660
THELMA: Yep.

831
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:06,122
Yep, that’s him going.
I love watching him go.

832
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,957

took to him.

833
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:10,793
JIMMY: Yeah, well,
I got you a room there,
Thelma.

834
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:13,379
You can go on in
and take yourself
a nice cold shower.

you know me, Jimmy,
I’m just a wild woman.

836

It’s our future.

837
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,324
What are you
gonna tell him?

838
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:44,743
Nothing.

839
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,538
I’m not gonna
tell him a thing.

840
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,499
The least I can do
is not make him
any more of an accessory

841
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:51,959
than he already is.

842
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:55,296
You are so sweet to that guy.
You know, you really are.

843
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,673
Imagine not wanting
to drag him into this.

844
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:59,425
I didn’t ask him to come.

845
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,552
It’s like I said,
he’s no different
than any other guy.

846
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:02,761
He just loves
the chase is all.

847

Well, he sure got
his work cut out
for him now, don’t he?

Can I ask you
one thing?
Maybe.

Are you in love
with somebody else?

have something to do

No, that’s not
why I came.

is probably having
a shit fit right about now.

949

What? Are you a criminal?

I haven’t done

Well, let’s see.

Let’s add it up here,

962
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:20,597
I robbed a gas station,

963
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:23,850
a couple of
convenience stores,
liquor stores.

964

00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:29,856
How?

966
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:33,527
Come on.

967
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:34,736
Okay.

968
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:37,239
Well, see, first you pick
your place, all right?

969
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:39,533
Then I just sit back
and watch it
for a little while.

970
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:42,286
Wait for that right moment
to make my move, see?

971
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:45,956
That’s something
you gotta know up here.
That shit cannot be taught.

972
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:50,043
Yeah, then…
Shit, I don’t want
to talk about this.

973
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:51,920
Come on, I do.

All right.

975
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:59,094
Then I’d waltz right in.

976
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:00,596
Yeah.

977
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:03,640
And I’d just kind of
waltz on in and I’d say,

978
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:07,102
“Ladies, gentlemen,
let’s see who wins a prize

Simple as that.

986
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:29,124
Then I’d just slip on out.

out of Dodge, yeah.

You were sure
gentlemanly about it.

01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:42,679
Well, now,
I’ve always believed
that, done properly,

991

Do you remember?

01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:23,340
Hi.

1231
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:04,173
LOUISE: Thelma.

1232
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:08,594
What?

1233
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:10,054
I want you to call Darryl.

1234
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:12,807
What for?

1235
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:19,855
I want you to find out
if he knows anything.

1236
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:22,566
If you think he does,
you gotta hang up the phone,

1237
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:24,235
’cause that means
the police have told him,

1238
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:26,529
and the phone’s
probably tapped.

1239
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:29,865
Tapped the phone?
What are you
talking about?

1240
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:32,910
Come on, Thelma,
murder one
and armed robbery?

1241
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:35,579
Murder one?
We can’t even say
it was self-defense?

1242
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:37,665
Well, it wasn’t.
We were walking away.
We got away.

1243
01:20:37,749 --> 01:20:39,250
Yeah, but they
don’t know that.

1244
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:41,085
It was just you
and me there.

1245
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:42,586
I’ll say he raped me
and you had to shoot him.

1246
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:44,213
That’s almost the truth.

1247
01:20:44,422 --> 01:20:46,549
It won’t work.
Why not?

1248
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:49,552
Because there’s
no physical evidence.
We can’t prove he did it.

1249
01:20:49,636 --> 01:20:52,805
We can’t even
probably prove by now
that he touched you.

1250
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:55,432
God.

1251
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:58,811
Law is some tricky
shit, isn’t it?

1252
01:21:02,732 --> 01:21:04,358
Hey, how do you know
about all this stuff
anyway?

1253
01:21:04,442 --> 01:21:06,402
Besides,
what’re we gonna say
about the robbery?

1254
01:21:06,486 --> 01:21:07,695
There’s no excuse for that.

1255
01:21:07,779 --> 01:21:10,030
There’s no such thing
as justifiable robbery.

1256
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:13,117
All right, Louise,
will you?
Where’d you get this?

1257
01:21:14,452 --> 01:21:15,619
Stole it.

1258
01:21:27,966 --> 01:21:29,008
Hi.

1259
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:30,926
Hi!

1260
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:32,720
Huh!

1261
01:21:34,681 --> 01:21:36,223
Who’s the nut?

1262
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:37,808
That’s Mrs. Dickinson’s
husband.

1263
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:38,934
Excuse me.

1264
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:41,812
Well, shit twice
and fall back in it.

1265
01:21:42,355 --> 01:21:43,480
God.

1266
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:48,402
Where’d you get
the $6,600 in cash?

1267
01:21:50,697 --> 01:21:51,864
A friend.

1268
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:54,742
We spoke
with a gentleman today
who says he delivered

1269
01:21:54,826 --> 01:21:57,328
very close
to that same amount to
a Ms. Louise Sawyer.

1270
01:21:57,412 --> 01:21:58,913
Do you know her, too?

1271
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:01,498
(CLEARS THROAT) Yes, sir.

1272
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:04,543
Yeah, I believe
she’s the woman
driving the car.

1273
01:22:05,837 --> 01:22:08,923
He said he took it
to a motel
in Oklahoma City.

1274
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:11,634
He also says
that at that time
he met a man.

1275
01:22:12,218 --> 01:22:14,345
He identified you
through a series
of mug shots.

1276
01:22:15,555 --> 01:22:18,933
He also told us that
you and Mrs. Dickinson
seemed close.

1277
01:22:19,392 --> 01:22:20,809
Is that true?

1278
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:23,187
Well, sir,

1279
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:26,941
you might say
we had a meeting of
the minds, yeah.

1280
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,694
Are you aware
that Mrs. Dickinson
and Ms. Sawyer

1281
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:32,571
are wanted
in connection
with a murder?

1282
01:22:32,656 --> 01:22:35,532
Murder? What,
Thelma? Damn!

1283
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:38,535
Did they ever indicate
that they might be
on the run from the law?

1284
01:22:40,413 --> 01:22:42,289
You know, sir,
now that you mention it,

1285
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:43,958
they might have
seemed a little bit jumpy.

1286
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:47,336
You know what?
What?

1287
01:22:48,171 --> 01:22:49,964
You’re starting
to irritate me.

1288
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:51,382
Yeah, me, too.

1289
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:53,384
That’ll happen.

1290
01:22:54,219 --> 01:22:55,761
Say, you two boys
have a lot in common.

1291
01:22:55,845 --> 01:22:58,180
Maybe I should
just step out
of the room for a sec.

1292
01:23:01,518 --> 01:23:02,726
I got a better idea.

1293
01:23:05,271 --> 01:23:07,147
Do you mind if
I speak to him alone
for a minute?

1294
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:29,169
What? What’d I do?
Nothing, that’s what.

1295
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:33,507
Tell you something,
this is a crock of shit,
Mr. John fucking Law.

1296
01:23:41,558 --> 01:23:43,600
Son, I got a feeling
about something and…

1297
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:44,685
Yeah?

1298
01:23:44,769 --> 01:23:46,687
…I just wanna
ask your opinion.

1299
01:23:48,815 --> 01:23:51,608
Do you think Thelma Dickinson
would have committed
armed robbery

1300
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:53,610
if you hadn’t taken
all their money?

1301
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:57,740
Get your foot
off that table.

1302
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:04,538
Cat got your tongue?

1303
01:24:04,622 --> 01:24:05,664
No.

1304
01:24:06,624 --> 01:24:08,083
Well, how… How do
you know I took it?

1305
01:24:08,668 --> 01:24:10,169
How do you know
they didn’t…

1306
01:24:11,421 --> 01:24:13,213
Don’t you fucking
lie to me!

1307
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:18,093
There’s two girls out there
that had a chance.
They had a chance.

1308
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:20,763
And now you’ve
screwed it up for them.
No.

1309
01:24:20,847 --> 01:24:22,890
And now they’re in
some serious trouble.

1310
01:24:23,266 --> 01:24:25,142
And I’m gonna hold you
personally responsible

1311
01:24:25,226 --> 01:24:27,311
for at least part of it
if anything happens to them.

1312
01:24:28,146 --> 01:24:30,147
I got no feeling for you.

1313
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:33,233
Now, you’re either
gonna tell me every
damn thing you know,

1314
01:24:33,318 --> 01:24:36,070
so there’s a small chance
that I can actually
do them some good,

1315
01:24:37,155 --> 01:24:40,991
or I’m gonna be all over you
like a fly on shit for the
rest of your natural life.

1316
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:43,827
Your miseries will be
my goddamn mission in life.

1317
01:24:44,454 --> 01:24:45,704
Yes, sir.

1318
01:24:47,957 --> 01:24:50,542
Okay?
Yeah. Yeah.
That’s right.

1319
01:24:50,627 --> 01:24:51,752
We understand each other?

1320
01:24:51,836 --> 01:24:53,170
Yeah.
Okay.

1321
01:24:58,093 --> 01:24:59,343
Mr. Dickinson?
Yeah?

1322
01:24:59,886 --> 01:25:02,304
If you’d just hang on,
I want a word with you.

go home now.
I’ll kill you!

1335
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:52,604
Excuse me,
do you have a phone?

1336
01:25:55,358 --> 01:25:56,817
Thank you.

1337
01:25:57,068 --> 01:25:58,318
Thelma,
listen up, now.

1338
01:25:58,403 --> 01:26:00,988
If you even think
he knows, I mean,
even if you’re not sure,

1339
01:26:01,364 --> 01:26:03,157
I want you to hang up,
you understand?

1340
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:04,324
Yeah.

Louise.

1536
01:39:46,730 --> 01:39:48,064
Jesus Christ!
I’m sorry.

1537
01:39:51,860 --> 01:39:53,861
Got it.
Okay. All right.

1538
01:39:53,946 --> 01:39:56,447
You want to step to
the back of the car,
please?

1539
01:39:57,825 --> 01:39:59,325
Louise, get the keys.

(GUN FIRING)

1541
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:07,875
Thelma, what is it?
What’s wrong?

1542
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:09,002
Air holes.

1543
01:40:09,253 --> 01:40:10,586
Open the trunk.

1544
01:40:12,756 --> 01:40:15,675
Shit, Thelma.
Who would’ve
thought it?

1545
01:40:16,051 --> 01:40:17,427
You want to step
into the trunk,
please?

(CRYING)

1547
01:40:19,346 --> 01:40:22,807
Please, I have
a wife and kids.
Please!

1548
01:40:23,475 --> 01:40:25,643
You do? Well,
you’re lucky.

1549
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:28,271
You be sweet to them,
especially your wife.

1550
01:40:28,355 --> 01:40:31,190
My husband
wasn’t sweet to me,
look how I turned out.

1551
01:40:31,275 --> 01:40:33,317
Now, go on.
Get in there.

1552
01:40:33,944 --> 01:40:36,487
LOUISE: Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a second.
Wait a second. Excuse me.

1553
01:40:37,197 --> 01:40:40,450
Oh. Wait a minute.
Officer, could I have
your belt, please?

1554
01:40:41,952 --> 01:40:43,870
Extra ammo.
Good idea.

1555
01:40:43,954 --> 01:40:47,331
And… And could I
trade glasses
with you, maybe?

1556
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:50,877
LOUISE: Thanks. Okay.

1557
01:40:50,961 --> 01:40:52,295
THELMA: Is that it?
LOUISE: Uh-huh.

1558
01:40:53,005 --> 01:40:54,005
Right.

1559
01:40:54,798 --> 01:40:57,050
Officer, I’m real
sorry about this.

1560
01:40:57,134 --> 01:40:58,468
I apologize, also.

1561
01:41:00,763 --> 01:41:01,763
Go.

1562
01:41:07,936 --> 01:41:09,812
You ready?
Hit it.

1563
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:16,152
Now, I know it’s crazy,

1564
01:41:17,488 --> 01:41:19,822
but I just feel like
I got a knack for this shit.

1565
01:41:19,907 --> 01:41:21,324
I believe you do.

1566
01:41:24,286 --> 01:41:25,453
Drive like hell.

1567
01:41:32,377 --> 01:41:34,754
The one thing
I can’t figure out is
whether these girls are

1568
01:41:34,838 --> 01:41:37,465
real smart
or just real,
real lucky.

1569
01:41:38,175 --> 01:41:39,675
It don’t matter.

1570
01:41:40,302 --> 01:41:43,638
Brains’ll only get you
so far and luck
always runs out.

1571
01:41:46,642 --> 01:41:48,267
THELMA: Louise,
we still going to Mexico?

1572
01:41:48,352 --> 01:41:49,393
LOUISE: Yeah.

1573
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:53,022
Then aren’t we going
in the wrong direction?

1574
01:41:53,565 --> 01:41:56,442
Well, I figure if you
take a state policeman,
shoot off his car,

1575
01:41:56,527 --> 01:41:58,194
take his gun
and lock him
in the trunk,

1576
01:41:58,278 --> 01:42:00,613
it’s best just to get on
out of the state if you can.

1577
01:42:00,697 --> 01:42:01,739
I heard that.

1578
01:42:02,699 --> 01:42:03,699
HORSEMAN: Hey!

1579
01:42:04,785 --> 01:42:06,702
Don’t dent my car!

(COW MOOING)

1581
01:42:11,834 --> 01:42:13,334
I think I fucked up.

1582
01:42:16,004 --> 01:42:18,548
I think I got us
in a situation where
we both could get killed.

1583
01:42:20,884 --> 01:42:23,302
Damn, I don’t know
why I just didn’t go
to the police right away.

1584
01:42:23,971 --> 01:42:25,680
You know why.
You already said.

1585
01:42:26,974 --> 01:42:27,974
What’d I say again?

1586
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:29,684
Nobody’d believe us.

1587
01:42:30,561 --> 01:42:33,312
We’d still get in trouble,
we’d still have
our lives ruined.

1588
01:42:34,731 --> 01:42:36,357
You know what else?
What?

1589
01:42:37,526 --> 01:42:39,152
That guy was hurting me.

1590
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:42,989
If you hadn’t come out
when you did, he would’ve
hurt me a lot worse.

1591
01:42:43,073 --> 01:42:44,824
And probably nothing
would’ve happened to him

1592
01:42:44,908 --> 01:42:46,742
’cause everybody did see me
dancing with him all night.

1593
01:42:46,952 --> 01:42:49,370
They would’ve made out
like I’d asked for it.

1594
01:42:50,914 --> 01:42:53,791
My life would’ve been
ruined a whole lot
worse than it is now.

1595
01:42:54,585 --> 01:42:56,085
At least now
I’m having some fun.

1596
01:42:58,005 --> 01:43:00,423
And I’m not sorry
that son of a bitch
is dead.

1597
01:43:01,049 --> 01:43:03,301
I’m just sorry
it was you that
did it and not me.

going out there?</i>

1605

Weird. We got some kind of
a snowball effect happening
here or something.

1606
01:43:40,047 --> 01:43:41,380
You’re still
with us, though.

1607

the face of the earth.</i>

1609
01:43:44,426 --> 01:43:47,094
Well, we’re not
in the middle of nowhere,
but we can see it from here.

1610
01:43:48,972 --> 01:43:50,306
I swear.

1611
01:43:50,891 --> 01:43:52,850
Louise, I almost feel
like I know you.

1612
01:43:53,018 --> 01:43:54,227
Well, you don’t.

1613
01:43:54,311 --> 01:43:56,604
You’re getting in deeper
every moment you’re gone.

1614
01:43:56,688 --> 01:43:59,232
Would you believe me
if I told you this whole
thing was an accident?

1615
01:43:59,316 --> 01:44:01,192
I do believe you.

That’s what I want
everybody to believe.

1617

Trouble is,
it doesn’t look
like an accident.

1618
01:44:07,324 --> 01:44:10,076
And you’re not here
to tell me about it.

1619
01:44:10,661 --> 01:44:13,079
I need your help here.

talk about it.</i>

1621

You wanna come on in?

1622
01:44:16,833 --> 01:44:18,042
<i>Don’t think so.</i>

1623
01:44:19,086 --> 01:44:22,338
Then I’m sorry.
We’re gonna have to
charge you with murder.

come out of this alive?</i>

1625

You know, certain words
and phrases just keep
drifting through my mind.

1626
01:44:29,388 --> 01:44:33,599
Things like “incarceration,”
“cavity search,”
“death by electrocution,”

1627
01:44:33,684 --> 01:44:36,394
“life imprisonment,”
shit like that.
You know what I’m saying?

1628
01:44:36,478 --> 01:44:38,479
So do I want to
come out alive?

1629
01:44:39,189 --> 01:44:40,982
I don’t know, I…

1630
01:44:46,154 --> 01:44:49,490
I don’t know. I think
we’re gonna have
to think about that.

1631
01:44:50,117 --> 01:44:53,536
Louise, I’ll do anything.

1632
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:58,541
I know what’s
making you run.

1633
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:01,961
I know what happened
to you in Texas.

1634
01:45:08,135 --> 01:45:09,802
Come on, Louise.

1635
01:45:11,179 --> 01:45:12,722
Don’t blow it.

1636

We got it!

1637
01:45:15,309 --> 01:45:16,809
Give it to me.

1638
01:45:23,859 --> 01:45:26,152
Max, you gotta
take me there.

1639
01:45:26,236 --> 01:45:27,570
No, Hal, cannot do.

1640
01:45:27,696 --> 01:45:29,989
I’m the only one
she’s ever spoken to.
You’ve done a good job.

1641
01:45:30,073 --> 01:45:31,699
You’re no good to me now.
You’re no good to me.

1642
01:45:31,783 --> 01:45:33,159
There’s nothing
you can do
for me now.

1643
01:45:33,243 --> 01:45:35,786
I don’t want anybody
losing their heads!

1644

gonna get shot!

1647

What?

1648
01:45:56,266 --> 01:45:59,018
You’re not gonna
give up on me,
are you?

1649
01:45:59,102 --> 01:46:00,144
What do you mean?

1650
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:03,397
You’re not gonna
make a deal
with that guy?

1651
01:46:04,274 --> 01:46:06,609
I mean,
I just want to know.

1652
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:10,404
Thelma, I’m not
making any deals.

1653
01:46:14,493 --> 01:46:17,912
I mean, I’d understand
if you was thinking about it.

1654
01:46:18,747 --> 01:46:22,249
In a way, you got
something to go back for,
Jimmy and all.

1655
01:46:22,334 --> 01:46:23,667
Jimmy’s not an option.

1656
01:46:26,755 --> 01:46:27,922
But…

1657
01:46:29,299 --> 01:46:35,679
I don’t know, you know,
something’s, like,
crossed over in me.

1658
01:46:36,139 --> 01:46:38,766
And I can’t go back.

1659
01:46:40,185 --> 01:46:43,604
I mean, I just
couldn’t live.

1660
01:46:43,855 --> 01:46:47,316
I know. I know
what you mean.

1661
01:46:49,653 --> 01:46:53,280
Anyway, we don’t
want to end up on
the damn Geraldo show.

1662
01:46:54,533 --> 01:46:55,825
Yeah.

1663
01:47:03,625 --> 01:47:06,127
They’re charging us
with murder.

1664

Ooh.

1665
01:47:08,588 --> 01:47:11,090
Yeah, they say that
we gotta figure out

1666
01:47:11,174 --> 01:47:12,675
if we want to come in
dead or alive.

1667

anything positive at all?

1669
01:47:47,294 --> 01:47:49,253
Guess you could
call it that.
My eyes are open.

1670
01:47:50,505 --> 01:47:53,215
Me, too.
I feel awake.

1671
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:54,550
Good.

1672
01:47:55,510 --> 01:47:56,635
Wide-awake.

1673
01:47:57,345 --> 01:48:00,639
I don’t remember ever
feeling this awake.
You know what I mean?

1674
01:48:02,434 --> 01:48:04,059
Everything looks different.

1675

is that cop gonna have
to come up with to beat that?

02:01:57,601 --> 02:01:59,227
Isn’t it beautiful?

1840
02:02:00,271 --> 02:02:03,648
Yeah. It’s something
else, all right.

Oh, my God.

1844
02:03:10,966 --> 02:03:11,966
It looks like the Army.

1845
02:03:12,051 --> 02:03:13,259
All this for us?

1846
02:03:13,761 --> 02:03:16,221
Hey, don’t let them
shoot those girls!

1847
02:03:17,139 --> 02:03:19,349
This is too much.
They got guns
pointing at them!

1848
02:03:19,433 --> 02:03:21,810
These women are armed,
Hal. This is standard.

1849

Now, calm down.
These boys know
what they’re doing.

I’m not giving up.

02:03:52,508 --> 02:03:55,969
Max, you gotta do something!
How many times, Max?

02:03:56,053 --> 02:03:58,471
How many times

Hey, listen! Will you
pull yourself together?
Now, listen to me!

You calm down.
Don’t make me

Go!

Yeah.
