1
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:15,200
Little honey, are you goin' out tonight?

2
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,450
Sonny, why don't you
hit me up with some syrup?

3
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,040
I ain't lookin' for a fight

4
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,540
I'll be right with you.

5
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:31,130
Here you go. You got the sausage,
pancakes for you, and there's your syrup.

6
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,340
He's over there.

7
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,640
- Decaf or regular?
- Regular, please.

8
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,480
You giris are kinda young to be smokin'.

9
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,940
Ruins your sex drive.

10
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,450
I'll get it!

11
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,660
I got it!

12
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,500
Hello?

13
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,290
Hey, little housewife. You all packed?
We're outta here tonight.

14
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,960
Well, I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.

15
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,380
You mean you haven't asked him yet?

16
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,550
Thelma, for Christ's sake.

17
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,470
Is he your husband or your father?

18
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,140
It is just two days, for God's sake.
Don't be a child.

19
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,980
Tell him you're goin' with me.
Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.

20
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,520
That don't carry much weight with Darryl.
He already thinks you're out of your mind.

21
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,150
- Are you at work?
- No, the Playboy Mansión.

22
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,360
Call you right back.

23
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,410
Darryl.

24
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,700
Darryl!

25
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,870
Honey, you better hurry up!

26
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,960
Goddamn it, Thelma.

27
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,170
Don't holler like that.

28
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,340
Shit.

29
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,090
Haven't I told you I can't stand
you hollerin' in the morning?

30
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,350
I'm sorry, doll. I just
didn't want you to be late.

31
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,930
Thank you.

32
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,150
- Hon?
- What?

33
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,570
Have a good day at work today.

34
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,120
Jesus.

35
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,160
Thank you, no.

36
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,910
Hon?

37
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,000
What?

38
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,250
You want anything special
for dinner tonight?

39
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,630
No, Thelma. I don't give a shit
what we have for dinner.

40
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,090
I may not even make it home for dinner.
You know how Fridays are.

41
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,520
Yeah. Funny how so many people
want to buy a carpet on a Friday night.

42
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,730
You'd almost think they'd want to
forget about it for the weekend.

43
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,570
Well, then, it's a good thing
you're not regional manager,

44
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,610
and I am.

45
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,620
Jesus!

46
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,750
Goddamn it, Homer!
Christ, I gotta get to work.

47
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,580
Don't need this bullshit in the morning.

48
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,210
Just leave 'em. I'll get 'em. Thank you.

49
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,920
For Christ's sakes.

50
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,800
And I want you outta here by five.

51
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,510
No, three. Get outta here by three today.

52
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,900
- Good mornin'.
- Mornin'. Is Louise there?

53
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,320
Why, yes, she is. Is this Thelma?
When are you gonna run away with me?

54
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,910
Not this weekend.
She's runnin' away with me.

55
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,320
- What'd he say?
- What time can you pick me up?

56
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,490
All right! I'll be there around two or three.

57
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,620
OK. Say, what kind of stuff do I bring?

58
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:54,290
Oh, I don't know. Warm stuff, I guess.
The mountains must get cold at night.

59
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,300
- I'm just gonna bring everything.
- OK. I will too, then.

60
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,840
- And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
- I don't know how to fish.

61
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,890
Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl does it.
How hard can it be?

62
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,430
- All right. I'll see you in a bit.
- OK. All right. Bye.

63
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,710
As you brush your shoes

64
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,880
And stand before the mirror

65
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,760
And you comb your hair

66
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,930
And grab your coat and out

67
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:51,100
And you walk the wet streets
trying to remember

68
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,190
All the wild night breezes
in your memory ever

69
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,780
And everything looks so complete

70
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,660
When you're walkin' out on the street

71
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,410
Hi. This is Jimmy. I'm not here right now.

72
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,580
And sends you flyin', cryin'

73
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,380
Oooh

74
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,750
Oooh-ee

75
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:25,180
The wild night is callin'

76
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,770
- Hey.
- Hi.

77
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,780
Thelma, we don't need the lantern.
The place has electricity.

78
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,360
- Oh, OK. No, I wanna take it just in case.
- In case of what?

79
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,370
In case there's some escaped
psycho killer on the loose

80
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:54,870
who cuts the electricity off
and tries to come in and kill us.

81
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,880
Sure, Thelma. Well, then
that lantern'll come in real handy.

82
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,510
Maybe we should tow your car behind
too, in case he steals the spark plugs.

83
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:07,380
We'd have to. That thing
barely makes it down the driveway.

84
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Careful. Careful.

85
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,200
- Everything in?
- Yeah.

86
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,700
Here you go. Ah! Be careful.

87
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,790
Smile.

88
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,130
Sit down.

89
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,590
Oh, Louise.

90
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,890
- Will you take care of this gun?
- What'd you bring that for?

91
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,350
Oh, come on. Psycho killers,
or bears, or snakes.

92
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:59,480
- I don't know how to use it. You take it.
- Put it away. Here, put it in my purse.

93
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,110
Thelma, good Lord.

94
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,950
So, whose place is this again?

95
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:13,450
Bob's, the day manager's. He's gettin'
a divorce. His wife's gettin' this place.

96
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:18,210
So he's lettin' all his friends use it
till he's got to turn over the keys.

97
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,840
I've never been out of town without Darryl.

98
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,000
How come Darryl let you go?

99
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,630
Cos I didn't ask him.

100
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,800
Shit, Thelma.

101
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,510
He's gonna kill you!

102
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,180
Well, he'd never let me go.

103
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,560
He never lets me do
one goddamn thing that's any fun.

104
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,520
All he wants me to do
is hang around the house

105
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,230
while he's out doin' God only knows what.

106
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,400
Well, you get what you settle for.

107
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,280
I left him a note.

108
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,870
I left him stuff to microwave.

109
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,740
Children laugh, children cry

110
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,870
They're the ones who will survive

111
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,590
Will they know what we've sold?
Nature's gift we turn for gold

112
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,760
I don't like what I see now

113
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,550
In my life, what I see now

114
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,220
I don't like where we're goin'

115
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,100
I don't like it, no

116
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,350
- Thelma.
- What?

117
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,060
We're getting older now

118
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,070
You and I

119
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,900
Who will show them
if we don't show them how?

120
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,740
I wanna know, is it true?

121
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:40,330
Is there a house of hope
for me and you?

122
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,710
Thelma, what are you doin'?

123
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,540
Smokin'.

124
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,000
Hey, I'm Louise.

125
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:58,220
Can't we just stop
somewhere for a minute?

126
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:01,430
We're not gonna get to the cabin
till after dark as it is.

127
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,940
Then what difference
would it make if we stop?

128
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,650
Come on. I never get to do stuff like this.

129
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,980
OK, but it's gonna be a quick stop.

130
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,150
Fine, OK!

131
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:41,350
I'm still waitin' here and it's half past two

132
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:48,520
And I don't wanna love you, but I do

133
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,030
I haven't seen a place
like this since Texas.

134
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,490
Isn't this fun?

135
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,580
- Y'all want a drink?
- No, thanks.

136
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,630
I'll have a Wild Turkey straight up
and a Coke back.

137
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,130
Thelma!

138
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,180
Oh, what? Is this my vacation or isn't it?

139
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,050
I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.

140
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:25,520
I'm sorry. It's just I haven't seen you this
way in a while. You're usually so sedate.

141
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,230
Well, I've had it
up to my ass with "sedate".

142
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,360
You said we was gonna get outta town
and for once just really let our hair down.

143
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,110
Well, darlin', look out,
cos my hair is comin' down.

144
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,490
All right. I changed my mind.
I'm gonna have a margarita,

145
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,540
and a shot of Cuervo on the side.

146
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,910
All right! Get me another one.

147
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,170
Hey!

148
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,170
Now, what are a couple of Kewpie dolls
like you doin' in a place like this?

149
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:59,010
- We left town to have some fun.
- Mindin' our own business. Try it.

150
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,680
And cos Louise here
is mad at her boyfriend cos...

151
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,440
- We wanted to get somethin' to eat.
- You come to the right place.

152
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,060
You like chilli? They got good chilli.

153
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:15,690
- Harlan, you botherin' these poor giris?
- Hell, no. I was just bein' friendly.

154
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,610
Well, it's a good thing
they're not all as friendly as you.

155
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,160
Hey, your name's Harlan?
I got an uncle named Harlan.

156
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,330
You do?

157
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:28,830
Is he a funny uncle? Cos if he is,
then he and I got somethin' in common.

158
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:38,590
I don't mean to be rude,
but I gotta talk to my friend in private.

159
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,550
I understand. I didn't mean to bother you.

160
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,390
It's just hard not to notice
two such pretty ladies as yourselves.

161
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:52,440
You better dance with me before
you leave, or I will never forgive you.

162
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,610
Sure. That'd be fun.

163
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,110
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.

164
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,620
Can't you tell when
somebody's hittin' on you?

165
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,700
Oh, so what if he was?

166
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,750
It's all your years of waitin' tables
that's made you jaded, that's all.

167
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,960
Maybe.

168
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:13,080
Just relax, will you?
You're makin' me nervous.

169
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,290
All right.

170
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,340
Oooh

171
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,090
Wa-wa, oooh

172
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,480
I woke up in a hotel,
I didn't know what to do

173
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,860
I turned the TV on
and wrote a letter to you...

174
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,030
That's a good band.

175
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,240
- I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
- I wonder if Jimmy's got back.

176
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,540
Why don't you just tell him to get lost?

177
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,210
Why don't you ditch that no-good
husband of yours? Huh?

178
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,380
This one's on Harlan.

179
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,340
Thanks!

180
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:06,390
Well, look. Jimmy'll come in
off the road and you won't be there.

181
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,680
He'll freak out and call you 100,000 times.

182
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,230
Sunday night you'll call him back, and
he'll be kissin' the ground you walk on.

183
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,900
Exactly.

184
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:19,570
In the meantime, you said we was gonna
have some fun. So let's have some.

185
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,740
- All right.
- OK.

186
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,870
Aah! Whoo!

187
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,710
All right.

188
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,420
- Let's dance.
- All right.

189
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,430
I woke up in a hotel,
I didn't know what to do

190
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,390
I turned the TV on
and wrote a letter to you

191
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,520
They was talkin' about a dragnet
up on the Interstate...

192
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,440
Thelma? That's a lovely name.

193
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:04,030
- I don't know what I'm doin'!
- Just follow me, Thelma.

194
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,950
Ma'am, you want to dance a little?

195
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,330
- Sure.
- All right.

196
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,210
The land of opportunity
for me is just a curse

197
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,750
Tell the judge in Bakersfield
my trial will have to wait

198
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,590
Now they're lookin' for a Cadillac
with Tennessee plates

199
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,050
She saw him singin' once
when she was 17

200
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,890
And ever since that day
she's been livin' in between

201
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:33,100
I was never king of nothin'
but this wild weekend

202
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,640
Anyway he wouldn't care,
hell, he gave 'em to his friends

203
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,150
All right! Here we go. Here we go.

204
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,100
Hey! Hey, Thelma!

205
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,020
I'm hittin' the little giris' room,
and then we're outta here.

206
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,390
I'm ready when you are.

207
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,860
- Wait, Louise, I wanna come with you.
- Come on. Turn around.

208
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,240
- I don't feel so good.
- What's wrong?

209
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,990
- Come on.
- Shit. Stop.

210
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,200
What's wrong?

211
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,620
I'm spinnin'.

212
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:24,000
Oopsy-doopsy. We need to get you
some fresh air, little lady.

213
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,240
- Look, have you seen my friend?
- Your friend?

214
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,870
Yeah. Yeah, she was over there dancin'.

215
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,790
How you feelin' now, darlin'?

216
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,840
Oh, thanks. I think I'm startin'
to feel a little better.

217
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:10,630
You're startin' to feel pretty good
to me, too. You know that?

218
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,430
I think I need to keep walkin'.

219
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:16,300
Wait a minute.
Where do you think you're goin'?

220
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,100
- I'm goin' back inside.
- Oh, no, no.

221
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,140
- Harlan...
- What?

222
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,850
Hey, quit it. Stop it. Stop it.

223
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,440
Thelma, Thelma, listen to me. Listen.

224
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,400
I'm not gonna hurt you, OK?
I just wanna kiss you. All right?

225
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,240
- No, no.
- Come on. Come on.

226
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,660
- Goddamn, you are gorgeous.
- Let me go.

227
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,080
- You are a gorgeous woman.
- Let me go. I'm married. Come on.

228
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,620
- That's OK. I'm married too.
- I don't feel good. I've been sick.

229
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,210
Aw!

230
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,250
Listen to me. I said
I'm not gonna hurt you.

231
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,920
All right? Relax.

232
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,220
Harlan, stop it, please! I mean it!

233
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,550
Wait! Don't! I mean it!

234
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,850
- Louise is gonna wonder where I am!
- Fuck Louise.

235
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,770
Hey!

236
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,150
Never fuckin' hit me! Fuckin' bitch!

237
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,270
- You hear me?
- Harlan, please, no!

238
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,860
- Don't hurt me, Harlan, please!
- Shut up!

239
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,570
Shut the fuck up! You hear me? Shut up!

240
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,070
Please. Please don't hurt me, Harlan.

241
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,200
- Goddamn bitch.
- Don't hurt me!

242
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,460
- Let her go!
- Louise!

243
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,830
Get the fuck outta here.

244
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,290
Louise!

245
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:35,930
You let her go, you fuckin' asshole, or
I'll splatter your ugly face all over this car.

246
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:50,940
All right. Hey, hey, just calm down.
We were just havin' a little fun, that's all.

247
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,070
Looks like you got
a real fucked-up idea of fun.

248
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,200
Come on.

249
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,490
Come on.

250
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,200
Turn around.

251
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,960
In the future,

252
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,670
when a woman's cryin' like that,

253
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,550
she isn't havin' any fun!

254
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,310
Bitch!

255
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:26,730
I shoulda gone ahead and fucked her.

256
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,810
What did you say?

257
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,270
I said suck my cock.

258
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,490
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

259
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,280
- Get the car.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

260
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,580
Louise, you shot him.

261
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,750
- Oh, my God.
- Get the car.

262
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:58,880
You watch your mouth, buddy.

263
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:07,060
Louise! Come on!

264
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,620
Watch it, you fuckin' asshole!

265
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,590
Louise.

266
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,310
Louise, where are we goin'?

267
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:52,230
I don't know. Just shut up, so I can think.

268
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:58,610
Shouldn't we go to the cops? I mean,
I think we ought to tell the police.

269
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:01,990
Tell 'em what? Just what do you think
we should tell 'em, huh?

270
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,160
Just tell 'em what happened.

271
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,990
Which part?

272
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,580
All of it. That he was rapin' me.

273
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,960
100 people saw you dancin'
cheek to cheek with him all night!

274
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,590
Who's gonna believe that?
We don't live in that kind of a worid!

275
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,750
Goddamn it! Pull over!

276
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,340
All right.

277
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,340
Thelma.

278
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,510
Thelma.

279
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,520
Thelma, I'm gonna...

280
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:22,900
I'm gonna stop someplace for a cup
of coffee, and then... Just for a second.

281
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:28,950
And then I'm gonna get it together
and we'll figure out then what to do.

282
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,160
Um, and everything's
gonna be fine, all right?

283
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:35,370
Everything's gonna... All right?

284
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,310
Now's not the time to panic.
If we panic now, we're done for.

285
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,240
Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us.

286
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,280
So we're still OK.

287
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:12,790
We just have to figure out
what we're gonna do next.

288
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:16,710
We just have to figure out
what we're gonna do.

289
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,880
I'll say one thing.

290
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,050
This is some vacation.

291
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,300
I sure am havin' a good time.
This is real fun.

292
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,890
If you weren't concerned with havin' so
much fun, we wouldn't be here right now.

293
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:38,640
- Just what is that supposed to mean?
- Oh, it just means shut up, Thelma.

294
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,610
So this is all my fault, is it?

295
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,670
I have to go to the bathroom.

296
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,300
Sorry.

297
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:34,830
Thanks. I'll try again later.

298
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,210
Move back, people.

299
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,500
Stand away from the line, please.

300
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,460
It's secured until further notice.

301
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:54,470
- Could you identify 'em if you saw 'em?
- Hell, I told you 50 times, yeah.

302
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,390
But neither one of those two
is the type to pull somethin' like this.

303
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,690
Well, you're no expert witness,
but what makes you so sure?

304
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:07,440
If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you
an expert on human nature, nothin' will.

305
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:11,200
I coulda told you Harlan Puckett
would end up buyin' it in a parking lot.

306
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,820
I'm just surprised it didn't happen sooner.

307
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,700
- Who do you think did it?
- Has anybody asked his wife?

308
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,790
She's the one I hope did it.

309
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,830
Lena, do you have
any ideas or don't you?

310
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,670
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was
some old gal, some old gal's husband.

311
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,300
It wasn't neither one of those two.

312
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:34,340
The smaller one, the one with
the tidy hairdo, she left me a huge tip.

313
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,140
- Well...
- What?

314
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:41,600
You didn't happen to notice what kind
of car they were drivin', did you?

315
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,650
It's a nightclub, Hal, not a drive-in.

316
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,480
I don't follow the customers
out to the parking lot. All right.

317
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,780
Lena, go on home.

318
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,950
You kept me here all night to ask me the
same old question over and over again?

319
00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:01,040
Ain't you gonna offer me some
teeny-eeny, witty-bitty little drink?

320
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,210
Behave yourself.

321
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:08,290
Neither of those two
was the murderin' type, Hal.

322
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,510
Hi. This is Jimmy.

323
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,400
Thelma, you in there?

324
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:44,620
Thelma, come on.
We're outta here, Thelma. Come on.

325
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:55,300
We're gonna need money.

326
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,340
Thelma, how much money
do you have on you?

327
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,100
What?

328
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:04,020
I'm gonna stop at the next town.
We'll get a motel room.

329
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,020
I can rest a little and then
I'll figure out what to do.

330
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,900
OK.

331
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,070
Wait. I'm lookin'.

332
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,530
$61.

333
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,370
Shit.

334
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,790
$41.

335
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,500
We're gonna need more money.

336
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,130
What are you doin'?
Why are you unpacking?

337
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:34,920
- You said we was just gonna take a nap.
- I'm tryin' to figure out what to do.

338
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,340
Well...

339
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,970
When you figure it out, just wake me up.

340
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:49,810
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- What's that supposed to mean?

341
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:53,190
- Why are you actin' like this?
- Actin' like what?

342
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,030
How am I supposed to act?

343
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:58,570
Excuse me for not knowin' how to act
when you blow somebody away!

344
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,490
You could help me try to figure out
what to do. I'm tryin' to figure it out.

345
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,910
- But you could try and help me!
- Try? I did!

346
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,290
I had a suggestion
that we go to the police!

347
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:10,210
But you didn't like that
so, frankly, I'm out of ideas.

348
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:15,130
What's the big rush, Thelma? If we
give 'em enough time, they'll come to us.

349
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:30,100
Shh. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

350
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:33,020
I'm just not ready to go to jail yet, OK?

351
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,780
Why don't you...

352
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:44,160
Why don't you go out to the pool
and take a swim or somethin', all right?

353
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,330
Now, I'll figure out what to do.

354
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,370
Jimmy, this is Louise.
I've been tryin' to call you.

355
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,630
- Louise. Hey, baby.
- Hi.

356
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:59,090
Now, where the hell are you at?
Are you all right?

357
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:03,220
Yeah, I'm fine. How are you?
Long time no see.

358
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:07,140
- You sound kinda funny, Louise.
- I am funny. I'm real funny.

359
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,810
Are you in town?
It sounds long-distance.

360
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,940
No, I'm out of town. I'm in...

361
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,690
I'm in deep shit, Jimmy.
Deep shit, Arkansas.

362
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:23,780
Louise, now you just tell me
what the hell's goin' on here.

363
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,410
I come back,
nobody knows where you are.

364
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,000
- Is Thelma with you?
- Listen, Jimmy.

365
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,750
I have about $6700 in the bank.

366
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,920
Now, I know you can't get it out,

367
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,670
but I need that money.

368
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:44,220
Can you wire me the $6700
and I'll pay you back?

369
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,850
What the fuck is goin' on here, Louise?

370
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,390
Listen...

371
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:53,230
Something real bad has happened.

372
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,610
And I can't tell you what.

373
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,900
Just that I did it,

374
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,700
and I can't undo it.

375
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:09,120
Will you help me? Please?

376
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, baby, of course I can.

377
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,420
But where? Why can't I bring it to you?

378
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,720
Jimmy...

379
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,350
Do you love me?

380
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,230
Yeah.

381
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,520
- Never mind. Never mind.
- Yeah, yeah.

382
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,730
Look, just...

383
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,450
Just wire it to Western Unión
in Oklahoma City, OK?

384
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:49,870
- So that's where you're at? Oklahoma?
- Not yet.

385
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,000
You call me back and I'll tell you
which office to go to.

386
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,710
All right, all right.
I'll call you back in an hour.

387
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,130
Thelma!

388
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:07,760
I can feel it when I hear
that lonesome highway

389
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,260
Thelma!

390
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:15,640
- Thelma!
- Agh! What?

391
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,480
- Get in the car.
- OK.

392
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,230
We can never know about tomorrow

393
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:29,410
But still we have to choose
which way to go

394
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:38,080
You and I are standing
at the crossroads

395
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:41,540
Even if they didn't do it,
they most likely witnessed it.

396
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:46,050
So somebody better talk to them.
Put out an APB and see what we get back.

397
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,840
All right.

398
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:50,850
Any reason to believe
they've left the state?

399
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,180
That's certainly possible.

400
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,480
Hal, why don't we go ahead
and let the Bureau in on this?

401
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:12,160
Louise, don't get mad, OK?
But where are we goin'?

402
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,790
Oklahoma City.

403
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:19,040
- Jimmy's gonna wire me some money...
- Jimmy? You talked to him?

404
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:21,540
- Did you tell him?
- No, I didn't tell him.

405
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:27,300
And that's what we gotta get straight.
Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet.

406
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:31,760
When you call him, you gotta
not tell him anything about this.

407
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:34,600
You gotta make sure
everything sounds real normal.

408
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:39,640
I called the asshole at four o'clock
in the morning. He wasn't even home.

409
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:42,310
I don't know what he's got
to be mad about.

410
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,900
I'm the one who should be mad.

411
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,820
Thelma,

412
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,820
I'm goin' to Mexico.

413
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:56,580
I figure I can make it in two and a half
days, but I'm gonna have to haul ass.

414
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:00,960
Are you up to this?
I mean, I gotta know. This isn't a game.

415
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:05,340
I'm in deep shit, and I gotta know
what you're gonna do.

416
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:12,550
I don't know. I don't know, Louise.
I mean, I don't know what you're askin'.

417
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,510
Don't you start flakin' out on me.

418
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,270
Goddamn it, Thelma, every time
we get in trouble you just get blank,

419
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:22,020
or plead insanity or some such shit.

420
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:27,110
Not this time. I mean, this time things
have changed. Everything's changed.

421
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,910
But I'm goin' to Mexico.

422
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,570
I'm goin'.

423
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:18,410
- Louise.
- Is that the way you answer the phone?

424
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:20,580
I was afraid I'd missed you.

425
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,580
I got it. I was afraid I couldn't
get a cheque cashed on Saturday.

426
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:29,590
- Who did it?
- A friend who owns a club. Doug Randall.

427
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:34,510
- You didn't say what it was for, did you?
- No. I told him I was buyin' a car.

428
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:37,760
Good. That's real good.
Listen, where do I go?

429
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,430
It's a place called the Vagabond Motel.

430
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:44,600
It's at 1921 Northeast 23rd.

431
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,440
It's under "Peaches".

432
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,190
What?

433
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,450
That's the codeword.

434
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,410
I miss you, Peaches.

435
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:59,490
Thanks, Jimmy. I appreciate it.

436
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:16,380
Ma'am, you sure you wouldn't
rather have the large economy size?

437
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:20,350
No, no. That's OK.

438
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,350
What are you lookin' at?

439
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,940
Hey, I want you to call Darryl.

440
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,230
Call him?

441
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:31,980
Say you're havin' a wonderful time
and you'll be home tomorrow night.

442
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:34,490
- Will I be?
- I don't know.

443
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:37,530
I won't.

444
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,370
Ah, the newspaper.

445
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,760
- This is Darryl.
- I have a collect call from Thelma.

446
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,970
- Will you accept?
- Yes, I will, operator.

447
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:06,310
Thelma! Where in the Sam Hill are you?

448
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:12,520
I'm with Louise.
We're in the mountains. We're fishin'.

449
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,030
Have you lost your mind? Is that it?

450
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:18,570
I leave for work and you take
complete leave of your senses?

451
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,620
Darryl, calm down, please.

452
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,990
Don't get so mad. I can explain, OK?

453
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,120
- See, Louise...
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

454
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,170
Oh, come on, kick it.

455
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,420
Shit. God.

456
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:39,090
Christ.

457
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:42,800
We're just gonna stay there
and fish and hang out and stuff.

458
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:45,390
We'll be home tomorrow night.

459
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:47,810
No, you won't. You'll be back today.

460
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:52,730
You get your butt back here,
Thelma, now. Goddamn it!

461
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,900
Darryl.

462
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,610
Darryl, you're my husband, not my father.

463
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,570
Oh, now, that does it.

464
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,490
That Louise is nothin' but a bad influence.

465
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,120
If you're not back here by tonight...

466
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,040
Thelma...

467
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:17,670
Well, then, I just don't wanna say.

468
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,930
Darryl...

469
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,890
Thelma.

470
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,930
Go fuck yourself.

471
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:31,640
Oh, that's good. That's just sweet.

472
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,270
Shit!

473
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,280
Darlin', are you all right? Did I cause that?

474
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,360
- No. I'm sorry.
- No? You're OK?

475
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,200
- Is there somethin' I can do for you?
- No, it's OK.

476
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,960
Crazy.

477
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:40,590
Excuse me, ma'am.
Which direction are you headin'?

478
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:44,340
See, I'm tryin' to get back to school,
my ride fell through, and...

479
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,720
I'm kinda stuck here like stink on stink.

480
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:52,020
So I was thinkin' that if you're
goin' my way, or if I'm goin' your way...

481
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:55,900
I think we're goin'
to Oklahoma City, but I'm not sure.

482
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,690
Yeah, well, I'd appreciate it much.

483
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:03,440
Well, see, it's really not up to me.
It's not my car.

484
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:06,490
We'd have to ask my friend.

485
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:11,200
But she'd probably say no.
She's a little bit uptight.

486
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:15,290
Maybe it's not such a good idea.
But I thank you for your time.

487
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,790
But, you know, I can ask.
It wouldn't hurt nothin'.

488
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,210
Well, no, it wouldn't hurt.

489
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:29,180
Louise. Hey, Louise, this young man
here is on his way back to school.

490
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:34,430
And I thought since we're goin' the same
direction, we could give him a ride, huh?

491
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,820
It's probably not a good idea.

492
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:46,950
No, probably not. But I appreciate your
time. Y'all have a good day. Drive safe.

493
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,490
Louise.

494
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:57,000
Did you see how polite he is?
He was real sweet.

495
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,170
- Thelma.
- What?

496
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,840
Cheer up, now.

497
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,600
Fill her up.

498
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:17,850
Sure wish we coulda brought him with us.

499
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,900
What'd Darryl have to say?

500
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:26,320
Oh, he said "OK, Thelma. I just wanted
to make sure you was all right."

501
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:30,280
"I hope you're havin' fun. You deserve it.
After all, you put up with me."

502
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:32,450
"I love you, honey."

503
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:41,460
So, how long before
we're in goddamn Mexico?

504
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:06,320
I just didn't think it would hurt
to give somebody a ride.

505
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,940
Did you see his butt?

506
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:11,030
Darryl don't have a cute butt.

507
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,910
You could park a car
in the shadow of his ass.

508
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:18,870
I'm sorry. I'm just not in the mood
for company right now.

509
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:26,960
Take this map. Find all the secondary
roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.

510
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:31,090
I think we should stay off the Interstate.
We're too conspicuous.

511
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:37,140
Looks like we could get on this road 81
here and head down towards Dallas.

512
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,430
I don't wanna go through Texas.
Find some other way to go.

513
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,940
Wait. What?

514
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:51,110
You wanna go to Mexico from Oklahoma,
but you don't wanna go through Texas?

515
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:55,240
Thelma, you know how I feel about Texas.
We're not goin' that way.

516
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:58,290
Yeah, I know, Louise,
but we're runnin' for our lives.

517
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:02,000
Can't you make an exception?
I mean, look at this map.

518
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:06,210
The only thing between
Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas. Look.

519
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,090
I'm not gonna talk about this.

520
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:11,470
Either find another way,
or give me the goddamn map and I will!

521
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:14,340
- You understand?
- No, Louise, I don't.

522
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:19,060
Now, how come you never told me
what happened to you there?

523
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:27,020
Look, you shoot off a guy's head
with his pants down,

524
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:30,650
believe me, Texas is not
the place you wanna get caught.

525
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:34,990
Now trust me. Now, I told you,
I'm not gonna talk about this any more.

526
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:14,820
Happy birthday, lady.

527
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:23,410
And, baby, you're so smart

528
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:26,210
You know
you could have been a schoolbook

529
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:32,090
Well, you could have been
anything that you wanted to

530
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:34,970
And I can tell

531
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:36,760
The way you do the things you do

532
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,810
The way you do the things you do,
the way you do the things you do

533
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,410
Is the manager in?

534
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:02,990
Marian, there's a police officer here.

535
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:28,190
All right, all right, Thelma, all right.

536
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:05,810
The other night there was a murder
out at the Silver Bullet.

537
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:07,980
A man was shot.

538
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:13,610
And we have some witnesses
that saw a 1966 T-Bird convertible

539
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:17,900
leavin' the scene, sort of speedin'
out of the driveway there.

540
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:21,740
And that vehicle is registered
to one Louise Sawyer.

541
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:28,040
And we have reason to believe that your
wife was the other occupant of that car.

542
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,460
What?

543
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:36,250
What?

544
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,380
What?

545
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:41,720
Excuse me. You're standin' in your pizza.

546
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,760
Oh, shit.

547
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:48,270
So tell me, Miss Thelma.
How is it you ain't got any kids?

548
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:52,560
God gives you somethin' special,
I think you oughta pass it on.

549
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:55,110
Well, Darryl... That's my husband.

550
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:57,980
- Darryl?
- Yeah. He says he's not ready yet.

551
00:47:58,110 --> 00:48:00,490
Says he's still too much of a kid himself.

552
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:04,450
- Kind of prides himself on bein' infantile.
- He's got a lot to be proud of.

553
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:07,580
- Louise and him don't get on.
- That's puttin' it mildly.

554
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,250
- She thinks he's a pig.
- I know he's a pig.

555
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:14,460
Did you get married real young,
Miss Thelma?

556
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:17,630
Well, I guess 18 is kinda young, but

557
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:23,300
we'd already been goin' out
four years when we got married.

558
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:26,100
- How long?
- Four years.

559
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,890
I never been with anybody but Darryl.

560
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:35,230
Oh, I'm sorry. Well, if you don't mind me
sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.

561
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:42,610
It's OK. He is an asshole.
Most of the time, I just let it slide.

562
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:49,240
You better slow down, Miss Louise.
That's a cop up ahead.

563
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:29,160
Maybe you got
a few too many parkin' tickets?

564
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,330
We'll take you to Oklahoma City,
then you best be on your way.

565
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:34,500
All right.

566
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:44,720
Prints on the trunk of the car
match those of Thelma Dickinson.

567
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:49,930
- Well, I'll be damned. Isn't that strange?
- And her husband says a gun is missing.

568
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:52,430
She took a lot of stuff.

569
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,770
It looks like she may be planning
on being gone a while.

570
00:49:55,890 --> 00:50:01,110
The strange thing is, her husband
said she would never touch that gun.

571
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:07,410
He got it for her cos he's out late a lot,
but he said she'd never touch it.

572
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:11,280
Wouldn't learn to shoot it.
Just kept it in the drawer for years.

573
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:13,790
- What kind of gun was it?
- 38.

574
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,450
Right. Where are they?

575
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:19,580
They were on their way to some guy's
cabin, and they never showed up.

576
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:25,920
All right. Now, I'm gonna go and...
Listen up, you two.

577
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:29,970
I'm gonna go in. It'll take a minute.
You two better say your goodbyes.

578
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:32,140
- Huh?
- OK.

579
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:41,310
Hi. I'm here to pick up
a money order for Louise Sawyer.

580
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,570
There's nothing.

581
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:50,360
How about "Peaches"?
Could you try a codeword "Peaches"?

582
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:53,410
Did I hear somebody say "Peaches"?

583
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:57,040
- Oh, my God. Jimmy.
- That's the secret word.

584
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:01,080
Show the lady what she's won, Don.

585
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:06,010
- What are you doin' here?
- I just came to see you, baby.

586
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:12,300
Can I have another room, please?
Put it on my credit card.

587
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:25,440
Thelma. Thelma, get your foot down.
Thelma, look who's here.

588
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:30,400
Oh, shit! Jimmy. Hi, stranger.
What in the worid are you doin' here?

589
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:34,120
Ask me no questions
and I'll tell you no lies.

590
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,330
Good answer. Same goes double for me.

591
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:41,790
- Who's the cowboy?
- Oh, this here... This is JD. He's...

592
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,340
- He's gone.
- A student. We're giving him a ride.

593
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:48,090
And then he... Louise said
that he would have to go, so...

594
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:51,010
- That's what he's doin'.
- Yeah, that's what I'm doin'.

595
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:53,890
- He's gone.
- Have a good trip.

596
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:56,470
- Thank you.
- Nice meeting you.

597
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:02,650
Yep. That's him goin'.
I love to watch him go.

598
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:07,230
- Thelma kinda took to him.
- Well, I got you a room there, Thelma.

599
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:10,110
You can go on in and
take yourself a nice cold shower.

600
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,320
Well, you know me, Jimmy.
I'm just a wild woman.

601
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,170
It's our future.

602
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,890
What are you gonna tell him?

603
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:43,690
Nothin'. I'm not gonna tell him a thing.

604
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:48,570
The least I can do is not make him
any more of an accessory than he is.

605
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:51,740
You are so sweet to that guy.
You know, you really are.

606
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:54,110
Imagine not wantin' to drag him into this.

607
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,660
I didn't ask him to come.

608
00:52:56,780 --> 00:53:00,160
It's no different than any other guy.
He just loves the chase.

609
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:03,710
Well, he sure got his work
cut out for him now, don't he?

610
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:06,250
Thelma, just put a lid on it.

611
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:10,420
Now...

612
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:15,680
- I want you to just guard that money.
- OK.

613
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:20,060
And if there's any problem,
you call me in room 211.

614
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,060
OK. I won't wait up.

615
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:45,580
- You want a drink?
- No.

616
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:49,670
Why don't you tell me what's goin' on?

617
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:53,340
I'm not gonna tell you what's goin' on.

618
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:58,340
Someday you'll understand why I can't.
But I'm not goin' to, so don't ask me.

619
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,430
- Can I ask you one thing?
- Maybe.

620
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:07,560
Are you in love with somebody else?

621
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:10,400
Does this have somethin' to do
with another man?

622
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,820
No, it's not anything like that.

623
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:18,240
Well, then, what is it, goddammit?

624
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,160
Are you just gonna leave for fuckin' ever?

625
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,250
Huh? What, did you
fuckin' kill somebody?

626
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:26,660
You start this shit, I'm outta here.

627
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:33,130
I'm sorry.

628
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:36,970
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

629
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:41,890
Wanna come over there and sit down?
I wanna give you somethin'.

630
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:44,640
- I'm fine right here.
- I wanna give you somethin'.

631
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:47,100
Give it to me here.

632
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,860
Here.

633
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:06,160
Why don't you try it on?

634
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:11,630
Well, you didn't see
that one comin', did ya?

635
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:14,590
Why, Jimmy?

636
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:18,590
Why now?

637
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:25,970
Try not to get too excited. I flew across
two states with that ring in my hand,

638
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:30,770
and you know I hate to fly.

639
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:38,030
You came all this way because you
thought I was with somebody else.

640
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:42,530
No, that's not why I came.

641
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,750
Because, you know,
I don't wanna lose you.

642
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:53,540
And I get the feelin', like,
you're gonna, like, split. Permanently.

643
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:56,590
That's not a good reason to get married.

644
00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:00,880
Well, I thought that's what you wanted.

645
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:05,140
I did. But not like this.

646
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,140
...cooking methods.
Questions are encouraged.

647
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:19,530
- Louise?
- No, Thelma, it's me.

648
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:22,660
Surprise.

649
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:26,410
I was just out there
and I was just thinkin' that...

650
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:31,500
Well, I know I'm supposed to be
gone and all, but, you know...

651
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:39,460
And I'm not havin' turd's luck
gettin' a ride out in this rain.

652
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:41,920
I was just thinkin' about you.

653
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:51,020
This is crazy. I'm gonna
get out of your hair, all right? I'm gonna.

654
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:53,940
Well, wait. Wait.

655
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,570
Where are you goin'?

656
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:03,150
Ah, I don't know. You know. Nowhere.

657
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,660
You think I'm happy playin'
one-night gigs in Ramada Inn lounges?

658
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:09,450
That you're the only one
whose dreams don't work out?

659
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:12,080
We both got what we settled for.

660
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,540
I think maybe you just
don't love me any more.

661
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:16,880
No, I do love you.

662
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:23,170
But I think it's time to just

663
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:27,550
let go of the old mistakes.

664
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:31,520
Just chalk it up to

665
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:35,270
bad timin'.

666
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:39,520
I think it's time to let go.

667
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:43,490
- OK.
- No.

668
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:48,740
Come on. Oh, you're too easy.
Come on. Here.

669
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:51,870
- All right. All right. I'll do it.
- Your turn.

670
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:53,370
Come on.

671
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,620
Well, don't just leave 'em there.

672
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:58,210
All right, all right.

673
00:57:58,330 --> 00:58:00,840
Ow. God. What have you got...?

674
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:06,510
See? This is an unfair advantage.
You got too much metal goin' here.

675
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:09,890
You want to lighten
the load a little bit? Yeah?

676
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:15,270
Yeah. I think that's better.
What do you think?

677
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:18,270
- Yeah.
- Yeah, OK.

678
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:24,070
- Take me, break me, make me a man.
- Watch your head. Careful.

679
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,450
- Oh, my head's fine.
- Who are you, anyway?

680
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:32,790
I'm the great and powerful Oz.
Who do you want to be?

681
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:36,120
Come on, tell me. I know
you're not just some schoolboy.

682
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:39,670
- Nobody ever tells me shit. Tell me.
- Oh, I'm just some guy.

683
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:44,050
A guy whose parole officer is probably
havin' a shitfit right about now.

684
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:46,970
What do you mean, "parole officer"?

685
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:51,510
- What? Are you a criminal?
- No. No, not no more, Thelma.

686
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:56,350
Let's see. Besides bustin' parole,
I haven't done one wrong thing.

687
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,310
- What'd you do?
- I'm a robber.

688
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:02,860
- You're a bank robber?
- No, no.

689
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:05,530
I don't rob no banks. Come on.

690
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:08,200
Well, what do you rob?

691
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:13,370
Well, let's see. Let's add it up here.

692
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:20,790
I robbed a gas station, a couple
of convenience stores, liquor stores.

693
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,920
Oh, my God.

694
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:27,260
How?

695
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:31,220
- Come on.
- OK.

696
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:35,930
Well, see, first you pick your place. Then
I sit back and watch it for a little while.

697
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:38,730
Wait for that right moment
to make my move, see?

698
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:42,270
That's somethin' you gotta know up here.
That shit cannot be taught.

699
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,440
Yeah, and then...
Oh, shit, I don't wanna talk about this.

700
00:59:46,570 --> 00:59:48,440
Come on. I do.

701
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:57,240
All right. Then I waltz right in. Yep.

702
00:59:57,370 --> 01:00:01,290
And I just kinda waltz on in
and I say "Ladies, gentlemen,

703
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:05,840
let's see who wins the prize for keepin'
cool. Simon says 'Everyone on the floor'."

704
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:09,050
"Nobody loses their head,
then nobody loses their head."

705
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:12,760
"You, sir. Yeah, you do the honours."

706
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:16,560
"Take the cash and put it in the bag
and you've an amazing story to tell."

707
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:20,730
"If not, well, you got a tag
on your toe. You decide."

708
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:25,650
Simple as that. Then I just slip on out.

709
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:32,530
And get the hell out of Dodge, yeah.

710
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:36,280
My goodness, you were sure
gentlemanly about it.

711
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:42,420
I believe that, done properly, robbery
doesn't have to be totally unpleasant.

712
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,960
- What?
- You're a real live outlaw, aren't you?

713
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:53,430
Well, I may be an outlaw, darlin', but
you're the one who's stealin' my heart.

714
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:58,510
- Oh, smooth.
- Ooh, yeah. Ooh. Isn't he? Isn't he?

715
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:01,140
- Yeah. Keep it that way.
- I sure am.

716
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:11,650
Remember when we first met?

717
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:14,820
Yeah.

718
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:20,160
- What happened? Tell me what you said.
- I said you had a nice pair of eyes.

719
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,960
And what'd I say? Do you remember?

720
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:32,420
Yeah, you shut 'em. Asked me
if I knew what colour they were.

721
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:36,430
And what'd you say?

722
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:40,180
I didn't know.

723
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:46,520
Jimmy, what colour are my eyes?

724
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:52,400
They're brown.

725
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,940
Wait. Wait.

726
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:07,700
Y'all want some more coffee?

727
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:09,870
Thank you.

728
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:21,220
I don't know what's goin' on
with you, or what happened,

729
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:27,100
or what you all did, but I'm not
gonna tell anybody anything,

730
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:29,850
and I'm not gonna say
that I even saw you.

731
01:04:32,310 --> 01:04:34,310
OK?

732
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:39,780
Damn, what'd you do? Take some kind
of pill, makes you say all the right stuff?

733
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:44,620
Yeah. I'm chokin' on it.

734
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,660
You sure you don't
want me to go with you?

735
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:56,250
I think it's probably not
a real good idea right now.

736
01:04:56,420 --> 01:05:01,380
But I'll catch up with you later,
on down the road.

737
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:05,050
Yeah.

738
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:13,230
Well, my taxi's here.

739
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,530
So, why don't you just keep that?

740
01:05:23,610 --> 01:05:25,660
Thanks.

741
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:28,990
I just want you to be happy.

742
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:31,870
I am happy, sweetie.

743
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,370
Happy as I can be.

744
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,540
All right.

745
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,840
All right.

746
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,050
Well, why don't you give
ol' Jimmy a kiss goodbye?

747
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,470
And I'll be gettin' outta here.

748
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,980
Come here, ol' Jimmy.

749
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:30,890
- I'll be seeing you, Louise.
- Mm-hm.

750
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:38,650
You have a safe trip.

751
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:57,160
It's a good thing he left when he did.
We thought we'd have to put out a fire.

752
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:13,220
- Hi.
- What happened to your hair?

753
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:16,390
Nothin'. Got messed up.

754
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:20,310
Thelma, what's wrong with you?

755
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:24,230
Nothin'. Why? Do I seem different?

756
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:30,740
Well, now that you mention it, yeah. You
seem like you're crazy or you're on drugs.

757
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:34,700
Well, I'm not on drugs.

758
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:37,290
But I might be crazy.

759
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:44,090
Thelma, what happened?

760
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,920
- What happened?
- JD came back.

761
01:07:49,050 --> 01:07:51,140
- Oh, my God, Louise. Oh, my God.
- Oh, no.

762
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:54,350
- I can't believe it. I just can't believe it.
- No!

763
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,680
Oh, my God. It's like...

764
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:03,150
I finally understand what the fuss is about.
It's just like a whole 'nother ball game.

765
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:07,820
Oh, darlin', I'm so happy for you.
That's great. I really am.

766
01:08:08,110 --> 01:08:11,200
You finally got laid properly.
That's so sweet.

767
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:16,040
- Where is he now?
- He's takin' a shower.

768
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:20,710
Thelma, you left him alone in the room?

769
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,420
Where's the money? My God,
Thelma, where's the money?

770
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:28,590
It's on the bed table.

771
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:30,630
It's OK.

772
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:35,510
It's on the nightstand. It's OK.

773
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:43,900
Oh! Oh, goddammit!

774
01:08:44,730 --> 01:08:47,400
I've never been lucky! Not one time!

775
01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:51,150
Shit!

776
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:54,490
That son of a bitch burgled me.
I don't believe it.

777
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:57,080
I don't believe it.

778
01:08:59,830 --> 01:09:01,870
Louise.

779
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,000
You OK?

780
01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:09,210
Louise.

781
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:14,050
I'm sorry. I mean it.

782
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:21,730
Louise. It's OK.

783
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:26,730
- It's OK.
- No, Thelma, it's not OK.

784
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:29,730
It's definitely not OK.

785
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:34,530
None of this is OK.

786
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:37,950
I mean, what are we gonna do for money?

787
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:41,250
Huh? How are we gonna get gas?

788
01:09:41,370 --> 01:09:43,750
I mean, tradin' on our good looks?

789
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:50,590
I mean... Oh, goddammit,
Thelma, it's not OK.

790
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:58,930
Louise. Hey. Now you listen to me.

791
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:02,390
Don't you worry about it.

792
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:06,440
You hear me? Come on. Stand up.

793
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:11,230
Louise, just don't you worry about it.

794
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,900
D'you hear? Come on.

795
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:20,790
Come on, damn it. Get your stuff.
Let's get outta here.

796
01:10:22,410 --> 01:10:26,620
Move! Jesus Christ. Come on. Come on.

797
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:32,090
Take your damn time.
Come on. Here we go.

798
01:10:54,610 --> 01:10:56,650
Damn, damn.

799
01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:03,290
Afraid of a little rain, Max?

800
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:10,170
Well, come on in. Wipe your feet.

801
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:27,690
As you know, we've tapped your phone
in the event that she calls in.

802
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:31,020
Is that gonna cost me?

803
01:11:31,150 --> 01:11:35,690
- Excuse me. May I?
- Hey, live it up. That's what it's there for.

804
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:41,200
We're going to have someone here at the
house, on the phones, until we find them.

805
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:44,290
The important thing is
not to let on you know anything.

806
01:11:44,410 --> 01:11:49,870
We want to try and find out where they
are. I don't want to get too personal,

807
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,540
but do you have
a good relationship with your wife?

808
01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:56,300
I love Thelma.

809
01:11:57,090 --> 01:12:01,430
I don't intend anything by that, sir.
It's just a question I have to ask.

810
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:05,350
- Are you close with her?
- Yeah, I guess.

811
01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:10,020
I mean, I'm about as close
as I can be to a nutcase like that.

812
01:12:13,310 --> 01:12:18,400
Yeah, well, if she calls, just be gentle.

813
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:22,990
You know, like you're
really happy to hear from her?

814
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:26,330
Like you really miss her.
Women love that shit.

815
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,290
OK. If you say so.

816
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:39,050
"Women love that shit."

817
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:55,480
Oh, cool. Can I wear these?

818
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:04,950
Want anything?

819
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:09,060
Drive, Louise! Drive! Drive the car!

820
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:16,230
Go! Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

821
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:22,280
What happened?

822
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:25,990
You robbed the store?
You robbed the goddamn store?

823
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:30,240
Well, we needed the money. It's not
like I killed anybody, for God's sake.

824
01:14:30,370 --> 01:14:33,540
- Thelma!
- We needed the money. Now we have it.

825
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:39,630
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit, Thelma!
- Louise, Louise. Come on, get a grip.

826
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:42,670
- Drive us to goddamn Mexico, will ya?
- OK.

827
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,010
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

828
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:49,510
Well, what... How'd you...
I mean, what'd you say?

829
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:52,970
Well, I just waltzed on in there and I said

830
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:55,230
Good morning, this is a robbery.

831
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:58,100
If nobody loses their head,
nobody'll lose their head.

832
01:14:58,230 --> 01:15:01,770
Simon says "Will you all lie down
on the floor, please? Right away?"

833
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:04,190
Ma'am, would you get down? Not you, sir.

834
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:10,620
Let's see who'll win a prize for keepin'
their cool. Put the cash in a paper bag.

835
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:13,200
You'll have an amazing story to tell.

836
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:16,410
If not, you'll have a tag
on your toe. You decide.

837
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:19,080
Hurry up. Let's go.

838
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:24,050
Ma'am, would you be quiet?
Sir, get down. Thank you. Just stay there.

839
01:15:24,170 --> 01:15:26,220
Just get real comfortable.

840
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:30,180
Throw in a coupla bottles
of Wild Turkey too, will you?

841
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,180
Yes, ma'am.

842
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:35,680
Thank you. Now, you get down too.

843
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:39,100
Ladies and gentlemen,
I thank you all for your cooperation.

844
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:42,570
Now, stay down on the floor
till I'm gone. Have a good day.

845
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:48,450
- Jesus Christ.
- Good God.

846
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:49,780
My Lord.

847
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,580
I'm fading out of sight

848
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:56,790
My wheels are the only sound

849
01:15:56,910 --> 01:15:59,670
Runnin' at the speed of light

850
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:03,000
Hey, Louise. You'd better slow down.

851
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:05,920
I'd just die if we get caught
over a speedin' ticket.

852
01:16:06,050 --> 01:16:10,340
You know, for the first time in my life,
I wish this car wasn't green.

853
01:16:11,390 --> 01:16:13,890
You sure we should be
drivin' in broad daylight?

854
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:19,060
I want to put some distance between us
and the scene of our last goddamn crime!

855
01:16:19,190 --> 01:16:21,270
Whoo-hoo!

856
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:26,280
Oh, man, you wouldn't have believed it.

857
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:30,950
It was like I'd been doin' it all my life.
I mean, nobody would believe it.

858
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:35,450
- Think you've found your calling?
- Maybe. Maybe.

859
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:38,620
The call of the wild. Whoo!

860
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:44,000
- You are disturbed.
- Yeah, I believe I am.

861
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:45,500
Whoo!

862
01:16:58,930 --> 01:17:01,560
Thelma, don't you litter.

863
01:17:03,650 --> 01:17:05,560
Wait a minute.

864
01:17:05,690 --> 01:17:09,650
God, I hate when you... This always
happens when you're in a hurry.

865
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:13,070
Damn. What are you gonna do?
Just stay drunk all day?

866
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:16,950
Try to.

867
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:26,460
Oh, isn't that nice? Truckdrivers are
always so nice. Best drivers on the road.

868
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:34,180
Oh, Lord. How original.

869
01:17:44,230 --> 01:17:46,690
Thank you.

870
01:17:46,810 --> 01:17:50,780
- Urgh! Man, that's disgusting.
- You pig. Just a fuckin' pig.

871
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:56,490
- Gross. What's he gotta do that for?
- I don't know. They think we like it.

872
01:17:57,030 --> 01:18:00,790
They think it turns us on,
is what they think. Shut up!

873
01:18:38,570 --> 01:18:40,950
James Lennox?

874
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:43,540
- Who wants to know?
- Arkansas State Police.

875
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:20,780
Hi.

876
01:19:59,490 --> 01:20:01,490
Thelma.

877
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,540
- What?
- I want you to call Darryl.

878
01:20:08,410 --> 01:20:10,460
What for?

879
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:16,050
I want you to find out
if he knows anything.

880
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:18,970
And if you think he does,
you gotta hang up the phone,

881
01:20:19,090 --> 01:20:23,100
cos that means the police have told him
and the phone's probably tapped.

882
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:26,430
Tapped the phone?
What are you talkin' about?

883
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:29,560
Come on, Thelma,
murder one and armed robbery?

884
01:20:29,690 --> 01:20:31,900
We can't even say it was self-defence?

885
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:35,690
- It wasn't. We were walkin' away.
- Yeah, but they don't know that.

886
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:39,030
It was just you and me. I'll say
he raped me and you had to shoot him.

887
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:41,660
- That's almost the truth.
- It won't work.

888
01:20:41,780 --> 01:20:45,030
- Why not?
- Because there's no physical evidence.

889
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:50,660
We can't prove he did it. We can't even
probably prove by now he touched you.

890
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:55,040
God. The law is some tricky shit, isn't it?

891
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:02,760
- How do you know about all this?
- Besides, what about the robbery?

892
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:06,470
There's no such thing
as justifiable robbery.

893
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:08,680
All right, Louise, will you?

894
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:11,770
- Where did you get this?
- Stole it.

895
01:21:24,490 --> 01:21:27,280
Hi. Hi!

896
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:30,200
Huh?

897
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:34,960
- Who's the nut?
- That's Mrs Dickinson's husband.

898
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:38,750
Well, shit twice and fall back in it.

899
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,260
God.

900
01:21:42,470 --> 01:21:45,090
Where did you get the $6600 in cash?

901
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:50,140
- A friend.
- We spoke with a gentleman today

902
01:21:50,270 --> 01:21:53,810
who says he delivered very close
to that amount to Miss Louise Sawyer.

903
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:57,940
- Do you know her too?
- Yes, sir.

904
01:21:58,070 --> 01:22:02,070
Yeah, I believe she's
the woman drivin' the car.

905
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:05,360
He said he took her
to a motel in Oklahoma City?

906
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:08,580
He also says that
at that time he met a man.

907
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:11,870
He identified you
through a series of mug shots.

908
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:15,880
He also told us that you
and Mrs Dickinson seemed "close".

909
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:18,000
Is that true?

910
01:22:18,710 --> 01:22:23,630
Well, sir, you might say
we had a meetin' of the minds, yeah.

911
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:29,060
Are you aware that Mrs Dickinson
and Miss Sawyer are wanted for murder?

912
01:22:29,180 --> 01:22:31,970
Murder? What, Thelma? Damn!

913
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:36,810
Did they ever indicate that
they might be on the run from the law?

914
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:41,860
You know, sir, now that you mention it,
they might have seemed a little bit jumpy.

915
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:44,570
- You know what?
- What?

916
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:47,950
- You're startin' to irritate me.
- Yeah, me too.

917
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:50,490
Well, that'll happen.

918
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:54,710
Say, you two boys have a lot in common.
Maybe I should just step out of the room.

919
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:00,630
I got a better idea.

920
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:04,970
Do you mind if I speak to him
alone for a minute?

921
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:25,570
What? What'd I do? Nothin', that's what.

922
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:28,160
I'll tell you somethin',
this is a crock of shit,

923
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:30,700
Mr John fuckin' Law.

924
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:41,210
- Son, I got a feelin' about somethin' and...
- Yeah?

925
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:43,920
...I just wanna ask your opinion.

926
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:48,090
Would Thelma Dickinson
have committed armed robbery

927
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:51,100
if you hadn't taken all their money?

928
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:54,520
Get your foot off that table.

929
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:02,230
- Cat got your tongue?
- No.

930
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:05,740
Well, how do you know I took it?
How do you know...

931
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:10,870
Don't you fuckin' lie to me!

932
01:24:11,070 --> 01:24:14,580
There's two giris out there
that had a chance. They had a chance.

933
01:24:14,990 --> 01:24:17,290
- And now you've screwed it up for them.
- No.

934
01:24:17,410 --> 01:24:19,790
And now they're in some serious trouble.

935
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:24,550
And I'll hold you responsible for at least
part of it if anything happens to them.

936
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:26,590
I got no feelin' for you.

937
01:24:26,710 --> 01:24:29,800
Now, you're either gonna tell me
every damn thing you know,

938
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:33,430
so there's a small chance
I can actually do them some good,

939
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:37,430
or I'm gonna be all over you like a fly
on shit for the rest of your natural life.

940
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,390
Your miseries will be
my goddamn missión in life.

941
01:24:40,810 --> 01:24:42,860
Yes, sir.

942
01:24:44,230 --> 01:24:47,230
- OK?
- Yeah. That's right.

943
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:49,570
We understand each other? OK.

944
01:24:54,530 --> 01:24:55,990
Mr Dickinson?

945
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:59,290
If you can just hang on,
I want a word with you.

946
01:24:59,410 --> 01:25:01,580
I like your wife.

947
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:05,380
Hey, come back here!

948
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,960
Come back here, you little shit!

949
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:11,300
Come here! Come here!

950
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:13,680
Come here! Come on!

951
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:16,640
Get him! I'll kill you!

952
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,500
- What will it be, ladies?
- Fill her up. There you go.

953
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:50,090
Excuse me. Do you have a phone?

954
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,630
Thank you.

955
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:57,510
Thelma, listen up. Even if you think
he knows, even if you're not sure,

956
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:00,560
- I want you to hang up. You understand?
- Yeah.

957
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:10,990
Goin' to a new life

958
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:14,780
Goin' in her own good time

959
01:26:14,910 --> 01:26:18,330
She ain't takin' no airplane

960
01:26:18,490 --> 01:26:22,120
Don't want to get there too fast

961
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:25,880
If it's not too late,
she can still take it back

962
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,380
Maybe it all will pass

963
01:26:39,310 --> 01:26:41,720
- Hello?
- Darryl, it's me.

964
01:26:41,890 --> 01:26:43,480
Thelma! Hello!

965
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:47,610
- He knows.
- Shit.

966
01:26:47,730 --> 01:26:50,020
I need more time.

967
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:55,400
What? All I said was "Hello".

968
01:26:55,910 --> 01:27:01,040
And she can't go back there no more

969
01:27:02,830 --> 01:27:04,790
I'd better go

970
01:27:04,910 --> 01:27:06,960
Don't look back

971
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:12,250
Pick up all that trash, baby

972
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:15,170
Don't look back

973
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:16,720
Keep that sunshine...

974
01:27:19,350 --> 01:27:22,600
- Yeah?
- This is Louise. Let me talk to the police.

975
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:24,770
- Hey, Louise.
- Hi.

976
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:27,730
Let me talk to the police.

977
01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:31,400
What do you mean?
There's no police here.

978
01:27:32,190 --> 01:27:34,280
Hey, where are you giris, anyway?

979
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:37,660
- Just let me talk to whoever's in charge.
- How do you know...

980
01:27:38,610 --> 01:27:41,490
Hello, Miss Sawyer?

981
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:46,460
I'm Investigator Hal Slocumb,
Arkansas State Police. How are you?

982
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:49,420
Well, I've been better.

983
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:53,300
- You be careful with that gun.
- Yes, sir, I know.

984
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:55,670
You giris are in some hot water.

985
01:27:55,800 --> 01:28:00,010
- You both OK? Neither one of you hurt?
- Oh, yes, sir. We're both fine.

986
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:01,970
Good.

987
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:06,560
- You wanna tell me what happened?
- Sure, over coffee sometime. I'll buy.

988
01:28:06,770 --> 01:28:11,560
I want you to know neither one of you
are charged with murder yet.

989
01:28:11,690 --> 01:28:14,230
You're just still wanted for questionin'.

990
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:18,530
Although now, Mrs Dickinson's
wanted in Oklahoma for armed robbery.

991
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:24,370
No kiddin'? Look. We gotta go.
I'll call you back, all right?

992
01:28:24,490 --> 01:28:29,080
Miss Sawyer, I don't think you all are
gonna make it to Mexico. We should talk.

993
01:28:29,210 --> 01:28:32,130
Please. I want to help you.

994
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:34,210
Shit.

995
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:38,550
God, that JD kid is a little shit.

996
01:28:38,670 --> 01:28:40,010
What?

997
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:41,680
What?

998
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:47,060
Thelma, how did they know we're goin'
to Mexico, huh? How'd they know that?

999
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:51,650
You told that thievin' little shit
where we were goin'?

1000
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:59,070
I just told him if he ever
got to Mexico, he should look us up.

1001
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:02,370
But I asked him not to tell.

1002
01:29:02,490 --> 01:29:08,910
I thought he would not tell anybody.
You know? I didn't think he'd tell.

1003
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:13,000
Why? What's he got to lose? Except
my life savings, of course. Oh, shit!

1004
01:29:13,130 --> 01:29:15,170
Thelma, goddammit.

1005
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:19,720
- Look, I'm sorry.
- Oh, goddammit, Thelma.

1006
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:22,010
Up until now we had
two things goin' for us:

1007
01:29:22,130 --> 01:29:24,600
Nobody knew where we were,
or where we were goin'.

1008
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:27,220
Now one of the things
we had goin' for us is gone!

1009
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:41,530
Look, Thelma. You just gotta stop talkin'
to people. You gotta stop bein' so open.

1010
01:29:41,650 --> 01:29:44,160
We're fugitives now, right?

1011
01:29:44,910 --> 01:29:47,280
Let's start behavin' like that.

1012
01:29:47,410 --> 01:29:49,410
- You're right.
- Thank you.

1013
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:55,920
- I was wondering...
- Listen, little boy.

1014
01:29:56,040 --> 01:30:00,260
Of course I want you to go, if that's
what's worrying you. Please don't think...

1015
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:03,470
No. I wasn't worrying about that.

1016
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:06,800
I knew you'd want me
to take the job, sure. But...

1017
01:30:09,810 --> 01:30:11,640
Sorry.

1018
01:30:11,770 --> 01:30:15,770
Julie, let's get married.

1019
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:25,200
My God, this is beautiful.

1020
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:27,740
It surely is.

1021
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:33,160
I always wanted to travel.
I just never got the opportunity.

1022
01:30:34,330 --> 01:30:36,580
You got it now.

1023
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:55,230
The morning sun touched lightly on
the eyes of Lucy Jordan

1024
01:30:55,690 --> 01:31:02,740
In a white suburban bedroom
in a white suburban town

1025
01:31:03,490 --> 01:31:10,620
As she lay there 'neath the covers
dreaming of a thousand lovers

1026
01:31:11,330 --> 01:31:19,590
Till the worid turned to orange
and the room went spinnin' round

1027
01:31:21,550 --> 01:31:27,340
At the age of 37 she realised

1028
01:31:27,470 --> 01:31:37,600
She'd never ride through Paris in a
sports car with the warm wind in her hair

1029
01:31:39,310 --> 01:31:46,950
So she let the phone keep ringing
and she sat there softly singing

1030
01:31:47,150 --> 01:31:54,540
Little nursery rhymes
she'd memorised in Daddy's easy chair

1031
01:31:57,420 --> 01:32:05,260
At the age of 37
she knew she'd found for ever

1032
01:32:05,380 --> 01:32:13,260
As she rode along through Paris
with the warm wind in her hair

1033
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:47,550
What's goin' on?

1034
01:32:51,140 --> 01:32:53,180
Nothin'.

1035
01:33:05,690 --> 01:33:08,780
Shit. Well, we don't need
the East Coast any more.

1036
01:33:13,370 --> 01:33:17,080
Hey, look. Look who it is.
It's that guy. I'll be darned.

1037
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:19,460
Ignore him.

1038
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:24,590
Hey, baby! I'm your Captain Muff-Diver!

1039
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,010
Your storm trooper of love!

1040
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:33,680
Hey!

1041
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,850
I ignored him.

1042
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:18,560
What?

1043
01:34:18,930 --> 01:34:21,140
- What?
- Harlan.

1044
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:25,690
- What about him?
- Nothin'.

1045
01:34:26,610 --> 01:34:28,900
Just...

1046
01:34:29,030 --> 01:34:32,320
Just the look on his face when...

1047
01:34:32,860 --> 01:34:34,160
What?

1048
01:34:34,910 --> 01:34:37,830
He sure wasn't expectin' that.

1049
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:43,290
"Suck my dick."

1050
01:34:46,670 --> 01:34:49,590
Thelma, it's not funny.

1051
01:34:49,710 --> 01:34:51,760
I know.

1052
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:02,100
It happened to you, didn't it?

1053
01:35:03,270 --> 01:35:05,850
What? What are you talkin' about?

1054
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:07,770
In Texas.

1055
01:35:07,940 --> 01:35:10,650
I mean, that's what happened, isn't it?

1056
01:35:11,730 --> 01:35:13,780
You was raped?

1057
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:23,080
Hey, now, look. I'm warnin' you.
Just drop it. I'm not gonna talk about that.

1058
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:26,580
- You understand?
- Yeah.

1059
01:35:26,710 --> 01:35:31,090
- I'm not talkin' about it. You understand?
- Yeah. OK, Louise.

1060
01:35:37,220 --> 01:35:39,470
It's OK.

1061
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:44,560
It's OK.

1062
01:36:19,090 --> 01:36:21,890
Oh, shit. Thelma, we're gettin' pulled over.

1063
01:36:23,810 --> 01:36:25,680
Shit! Shit!

1064
01:36:25,810 --> 01:36:29,150
- What do you wanna do? What'll we do?
- I don't know! Oh, shit!

1065
01:36:29,270 --> 01:36:33,480
All right. We'll play it by ear.
Maybe he's just gonna give me a ticket.

1066
01:36:33,610 --> 01:36:37,780
Oh, God. Please don't let us get caught.
Please, God, don't let us get caught.

1067
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:40,570
All right, I'm just gonna pull over.

1068
01:36:57,380 --> 01:36:58,880
Turn off your engine.

1069
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:06,970
He's puttin' on his hat.

1070
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:20,400
Oh, my God. He's a Nazi.

1071
01:37:20,530 --> 01:37:22,820
- What's he doin'?
- He's walkin' this way.

1072
01:37:30,370 --> 01:37:33,790
Hello, Officer. Is there a problem?

1073
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:38,510
- Wanna let me see your licence, please?
- Right.

1074
01:37:39,970 --> 01:37:42,050
Here it is.

1075
01:37:42,180 --> 01:37:45,430
- Wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
- All right.

1076
01:37:45,930 --> 01:37:49,430
I told you to slow down.
Officer, I told her to slow down.

1077
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:52,060
She did. How fast was I goin'?

1078
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,190
About 110.

1079
01:37:54,310 --> 01:37:57,570
- Wanna get out of the car, please?
- Yes, sir. Sure.

1080
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:04,740
- Come with me, please.
- Yes, sir.

1081
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:10,750
- This your vehicle?
- Yes, sir, that is.

1082
01:38:14,330 --> 01:38:17,590
- Wanna get in the car, please?
- Yes, sir.

1083
01:38:19,590 --> 01:38:21,630
- The front or the back?
- Front.

1084
01:38:25,890 --> 01:38:28,260
Wanna take off your eyewear, please?

1085
01:38:28,390 --> 01:38:30,020
Yes, sir.

1086
01:38:33,190 --> 01:38:35,400
Am I in trouble, Officer?

1087
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:39,360
As far as I'm concerned,
yes, ma'am, you're in a lot of trouble.

1088
01:38:40,030 --> 01:38:41,440
This is 98...

1089
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:45,030
You wanna step back
and get in your car, please?

1090
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:48,410
Officer, I am so sorry about this,

1091
01:38:48,530 --> 01:38:51,500
but would you let go of that?

1092
01:38:51,620 --> 01:38:53,750
Now, I really, really apologise,

1093
01:38:53,910 --> 01:38:57,000
but would you put your hands
on the steering wheel?

1094
01:38:57,130 --> 01:39:00,920
See, if you get on that radio, you'll
find out we're wanted in two states,

1095
01:39:01,090 --> 01:39:04,550
and probably considered armed
and dangerous - at least I am -

1096
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:07,760
and then our whole plan
is just gonna be all shot to hell.

1097
01:39:07,890 --> 01:39:10,100
Louise, take his gun.

1098
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:13,480
Take his gun, Louise. Right there.

1099
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:14,600
Right.

1100
01:39:14,730 --> 01:39:16,560
I'm real sorry. Excuse me.

1101
01:39:16,690 --> 01:39:19,440
Wanna step out of the car, please?

1102
01:39:22,490 --> 01:39:26,610
I swear, three days ago neither one of us
would've ever pulled a stunt like this.

1103
01:39:26,740 --> 01:39:29,780
But if you'd ever met my husband,
you'd understand why.

1104
01:39:29,910 --> 01:39:32,660
You wanna put your hands
on your head, please?

1105
01:39:32,790 --> 01:39:34,210
- Louise.
- What?

1106
01:39:34,330 --> 01:39:36,170
- Shoot the radio.
- Right.

1107
01:39:40,670 --> 01:39:42,800
The police radio, Louise.

1108
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:44,720
- Jesus Christ.
- I'm sorry.

1109
01:39:48,430 --> 01:39:50,470
- Got it.
- OK.

1110
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:53,430
You wanna step
to the back of the car, please?

1111
01:39:54,390 --> 01:39:56,770
Louise, get the keys.

1112
01:40:02,270 --> 01:40:05,360
- Thelma? What...
- Air holes.

1113
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:07,950
Open the trunk.

1114
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:12,240
Shit, Thelma. Who'd have thought of it?

1115
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:15,870
You wanna step into the trunk, please?

1116
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Please... I have a wife and kids. Please!

1117
01:40:20,130 --> 01:40:22,170
You do? Well, you're lucky.

1118
01:40:22,290 --> 01:40:24,880
You be sweet to 'em. Especially your wife.

1119
01:40:25,010 --> 01:40:27,720
My husband wasn't sweet to me.
Look how I turned out.

1120
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,890
Now go on. Get in there.

1121
01:40:30,930 --> 01:40:33,640
Oh, wait a second,
wait a second. Excuse me.

1122
01:40:33,810 --> 01:40:37,560
Oh, wait a minute. Officer,
could I have your belt, please?

1123
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:40,480
- Extra ammo.
- Good idea.

1124
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:43,940
And could I trade glasses
with you, maybe?

1125
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:47,570
Thanks.

1126
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:49,740
Is that it?

1127
01:40:51,370 --> 01:40:54,950
- Officer, I'm real sorry about this.
- I apologise also.

1128
01:40:57,500 --> 01:40:58,910
Go.

1129
01:41:04,630 --> 01:41:06,880
- You ready?
- Hit it.

1130
01:41:10,970 --> 01:41:16,310
You know, I know it's crazy, but
I just feel like I got a knack for this shit.

1131
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:18,730
I believe you do.

1132
01:41:21,150 --> 01:41:23,560
Drive like hell.

1133
01:41:28,650 --> 01:41:34,410
You know, I can't figure out whether these
giris are real smart or just real, real lucky.

1134
01:41:34,530 --> 01:41:36,580
It don't matter.

1135
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:40,000
Brains'll only get you so far,
and luck always runs out.

1136
01:41:43,170 --> 01:41:46,130
- Louise, are we still goin' to Mexico?
- Yeah.

1137
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:50,130
Then aren't we goin'
in the wrong direction?

1138
01:41:50,260 --> 01:41:54,680
I figure if you take a state policeman,
take his gun and lock him in the trunk,

1139
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:58,270
- it's best just to get on out of the state.
- I heard that.

1140
01:42:01,350 --> 01:42:03,850
Don't dent my car!

1141
01:42:08,110 --> 01:42:10,360
I think I fucked up.

1142
01:42:12,450 --> 01:42:16,370
I think I got us into a situation
where we both could get killed.

1143
01:42:17,450 --> 01:42:22,250
- Why didn't I go to the police right away?
- You know why. You already said.

1144
01:42:23,710 --> 01:42:27,000
- What'd I say again?
- Nobody'd believe us.

1145
01:42:27,130 --> 01:42:31,050
We'd still get in trouble.
We'd still have our lives ruined.

1146
01:42:31,170 --> 01:42:33,550
- You know what else?
- What?

1147
01:42:34,050 --> 01:42:39,560
That guy was hurtin' me. And if you hadn't
come, he would've hurt me a lot worse.

1148
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:43,270
And nothin' woulda happened to him
cos everyone saw me dancin' with him.

1149
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:46,110
They woulda made out
like I'd asked for it.

1150
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:51,070
My life woulda been ruined
a whole lot worse than it is now.

1151
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:53,320
At least now I'm havin' some fun.

1152
01:42:54,610 --> 01:42:57,410
And I'm not sorry
that son of a bitch is dead.

1153
01:42:57,530 --> 01:42:59,870
I'm just sorry it was you
that did it, not me.

1154
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:20,310
- Hello?
- Let me talk to Slocumb.

1155
01:43:21,970 --> 01:43:24,230
She wants to talk to you.

1156
01:43:29,070 --> 01:43:30,780
- Hello. Louise?
- Hi.

1157
01:43:30,940 --> 01:43:32,740
How are things goin' out there?

1158
01:43:32,860 --> 01:43:36,410
Weird. We got some kind of
a snowball effect happenin' here.

1159
01:43:36,530 --> 01:43:40,830
You're still with us, though. You're
somewhere on the face of the earth.

1160
01:43:40,990 --> 01:43:45,330
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere,
but we can see it from here.

1161
01:43:45,460 --> 01:43:47,420
I swear.

1162
01:43:47,540 --> 01:43:50,800
- Louise, I almost feel like I know you.
- Well, you don't.

1163
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:53,050
You're gettin' in deeper every moment.

1164
01:43:53,170 --> 01:43:55,670
Would you believe
this was all an accident?

1165
01:43:55,800 --> 01:44:00,550
I do believe you. That's what
I want everybody to believe.

1166
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:03,470
The trouble is,
it doesn't look like an accident.

1167
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:06,060
And you're not here to tell me about it.

1168
01:44:07,140 --> 01:44:10,940
- I need your help. Did Harlan Puckett...
- I don't wanna talk about it.

1169
01:44:11,070 --> 01:44:14,320
- You wanna come on in?
- I don't think so.

1170
01:44:15,650 --> 01:44:18,910
Then I'm sorry. We're gonna
have to charge you with murder.

1171
01:44:19,570 --> 01:44:21,410
Do you wanna come out of this alive?

1172
01:44:21,530 --> 01:44:25,750
You know, certain words and phrases
just keep driftin' through my mind.

1173
01:44:25,910 --> 01:44:29,920
Things like "incarceration", "cavity
search", "death by electrocution",

1174
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:32,920
"life imprisonment" -
you know what I'm sayin'?

1175
01:44:33,050 --> 01:44:35,840
So do I wanna come out alive?

1176
01:44:35,970 --> 01:44:38,220
I don't know. I...

1177
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:46,100
I don't know. I think
we're gonna have to think about that.

1178
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:48,890
Louise...

1179
01:44:49,020 --> 01:44:51,230
I'll do anything.

1180
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:58,400
I know what's makin' you run.
I know what happened to you in Texas.

1181
01:45:04,700 --> 01:45:06,750
Come on, Louise.

1182
01:45:07,660 --> 01:45:09,460
Don't blow it.

1183
01:45:09,830 --> 01:45:11,630
We got it!

1184
01:45:11,790 --> 01:45:14,090
Give it to me.

1185
01:45:20,430 --> 01:45:22,430
Max, you gotta take me there.

1186
01:45:22,550 --> 01:45:25,600
- No, Hal. Cannot do.
- I'm the only one she's ever...

1187
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:29,560
You're no good to me now.
There's nothing you can do for me now.

1188
01:45:29,690 --> 01:45:33,730
I don't want anybody losin' their heads!
You know what happens.

1189
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:39,150
The volume gets turned way up, and the
next thing you know, these giris get shot!

1190
01:45:49,870 --> 01:45:51,500
What?

1191
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:55,420
You're not gonna give up on me, are you?

1192
01:45:55,590 --> 01:45:57,960
What do you mean?

1193
01:45:58,090 --> 01:46:00,800
You're not gonna
make a deal with that guy?

1194
01:46:00,930 --> 01:46:03,390
I mean, I just wanna know.

1195
01:46:04,970 --> 01:46:07,430
Thelma, I'm not makin' any deals.

1196
01:46:11,190 --> 01:46:15,060
I mean, I'd understand
if you was thinkin' about it.

1197
01:46:15,190 --> 01:46:18,780
In a way, you got somethin'
to go back for. Jimmy and all.

1198
01:46:18,940 --> 01:46:21,400
Jimmy's not an option.

1199
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:25,740
But...

1200
01:46:25,870 --> 01:46:32,540
I don't know. You know,
something's, like, crossed over in me,

1201
01:46:32,670 --> 01:46:35,290
and I can't go back.

1202
01:46:36,670 --> 01:46:40,090
I mean... I just couldn't live.

1203
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:43,590
I know. I know what you mean.

1204
01:46:46,180 --> 01:46:50,060
Anyway, we don't wanna
end up on the damn Geraldo show.

1205
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:52,600
Yeah.

1206
01:47:00,150 --> 01:47:02,190
They're chargin' us with murder.

1207
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:10,290
Yeah. They say that we gotta figure out
if we want to come in dead or alive.

1208
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:14,170
Gosh. Didn't he say
anything positive at all?

1209
01:47:41,570 --> 01:47:43,740
You awake?

1210
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:46,990
Guess you could call it that.
My eyes are open.

1211
01:47:47,110 --> 01:47:49,740
Me too. I feel awake.

1212
01:47:49,870 --> 01:47:53,120
- Good.
- Wide awake.

1213
01:47:53,790 --> 01:47:57,750
I don't remember ever feelin'
this awake. Know what I mean?

1214
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:01,380
Everything looks different.

1215
01:48:02,250 --> 01:48:06,630
You feel like that too? Like you got
somethin' to look forward to?

1216
01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:11,390
We'll be drinkin' margaritas
by the sea, mamacita.

1217
01:48:11,510 --> 01:48:14,230
- We could change our names.
- And live in a hacienda.

1218
01:48:14,350 --> 01:48:17,690
I'm gonna get a job.
I'm gonna work at Club Med.

1219
01:48:18,060 --> 01:48:19,810
Yeah.

1220
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:24,030
What kind of a deal is that cop
gonna have to come up with to beat that?

1221
01:48:24,150 --> 01:48:27,410
- Have to be pretty good.
- Have to be pretty damn good.

1222
01:48:39,380 --> 01:48:42,170
But I do have some advice to pass along,

1223
01:48:42,290 --> 01:48:44,920
right here in the words of this song.

1224
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:47,220
Better not look down

1225
01:48:47,340 --> 01:48:49,890
If you want to keep on flyin'

1226
01:48:50,010 --> 01:48:51,760
Put the hammer down

1227
01:48:51,890 --> 01:48:54,640
Keep it full speed ahead

1228
01:48:54,770 --> 01:48:56,850
Better not look back

1229
01:48:56,980 --> 01:48:59,480
Or you might just wind up cryin'

1230
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:01,650
You can keep it movin'...

1231
01:49:02,020 --> 01:49:06,440
Oh, my God, Louise.
Oh, look, look. See? That's him.

1232
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:10,660
It's him. It's definitely him.

1233
01:49:11,780 --> 01:49:13,830
Pass him.

1234
01:49:31,090 --> 01:49:34,760
Hey, baby! You ready for a big dick?

1235
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:48,780
- Hi!
- Hi there. You all right?

1236
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:52,870
- We're fine. How are you?
- Grrrreat!

1237
01:49:53,660 --> 01:49:56,120
Are you giris about ready to get serious?

1238
01:49:59,210 --> 01:50:01,670
I think so.

1239
01:50:01,790 --> 01:50:02,710
Follow us.

1240
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:04,880
Better not look down

1241
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:07,590
If you want to keep on flyin'

1242
01:50:07,710 --> 01:50:09,920
Put the hammer down

1243
01:50:12,470 --> 01:50:14,470
Better not look down

1244
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:17,180
Or you might just wind up cryin'

1245
01:50:17,310 --> 01:50:21,060
You can keep it movin'
if you don't look down

1246
01:50:22,020 --> 01:50:23,980
Better not look down

1247
01:50:24,110 --> 01:50:26,730
If you want to keep on flyin'

1248
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:30,700
Put the hammer down,
keep it full speed ahead

1249
01:50:31,610 --> 01:50:33,740
Better not look down

1250
01:50:33,860 --> 01:50:36,330
Or you might just wind up cryin'

1251
01:50:36,530 --> 01:50:40,000
You can keep it movin'
if you don't look down

1252
01:51:02,310 --> 01:51:04,900
- Where are you goin'?
- Fresno.

1253
01:51:05,060 --> 01:51:07,360
We've been seein' you all over the place.

1254
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:11,190
Why don't you take off those shades?
I wanna see your eyes.

1255
01:51:11,780 --> 01:51:14,240
Yeah, I been seein' you too.

1256
01:51:14,360 --> 01:51:18,030
We think you have really bad manners.

1257
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:22,870
Where do you get off behavin' like that
with women you don't even know? Huh?

1258
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:29,750
How would you feel if somebody
did that to your mother, or your sister,

1259
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:31,670
or your wife?

1260
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:34,260
Huh? What are you talkin' about?

1261
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:37,340
You know damn well
what I'm talkin' about.

1262
01:51:37,510 --> 01:51:41,890
I mean, really! That business with your
tongue? What is that? That is disgustin'!

1263
01:51:42,020 --> 01:51:46,400
And that other shit of pointin' to your lap.
What is that supposed to mean, exactly?

1264
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:49,860
Does that mean "Pull over.
I wanna show you what a fat slob I am"?

1265
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:52,400
Yeah, or does that mean "Suck my dick"?

1266
01:51:52,530 --> 01:51:54,650
- You women are crazy!
- You got that right.

1267
01:51:54,780 --> 01:51:57,450
We think you should apologise.

1268
01:51:57,570 --> 01:51:59,620
I ain't apologising for shit!

1269
01:51:59,740 --> 01:52:02,290
You say you're sorry.

1270
01:52:02,750 --> 01:52:05,370
Fuck that!

1271
01:52:10,420 --> 01:52:14,380
You say you're sorry,
or I'm gonna make you fuckin' sorry.

1272
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:16,510
Aw, Jesus!

1273
01:52:16,630 --> 01:52:19,550
I bet you even called us "beavers"
on your CB radio.

1274
01:52:19,680 --> 01:52:21,560
Yeah. Sure did!

1275
01:52:22,310 --> 01:52:25,310
Damn! I hate being called
a beaver. Don't you?

1276
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:27,810
You gonna apologise, or what?

1277
01:52:29,230 --> 01:52:30,860
Fuck you!

1278
01:52:39,820 --> 01:52:42,120
Oh! Goddamn!

1279
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:43,700
You bitch!

1280
01:52:45,450 --> 01:52:49,290
- I don't think he's gonna apologise.
- Nah. I don't think so.

1281
01:53:02,180 --> 01:53:04,810
You bitches!

1282
01:53:04,930 --> 01:53:07,060
You bitches from hell!

1283
01:53:07,180 --> 01:53:08,770
Goddammit!

1284
01:53:09,560 --> 01:53:12,270
You're gonna have to pay for this!

1285
01:53:14,150 --> 01:53:17,530
You're gonna have to pay for this!

1286
01:53:17,650 --> 01:53:20,700
I'm gonna make you! Yeah!

1287
01:53:27,080 --> 01:53:31,420
I'm gonna make you pay
for this! You hear me?

1288
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:38,840
Oh, my God!

1289
01:53:38,970 --> 01:53:43,680
- Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
- Oh, off the TV.

1290
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:46,270
And where'd you learn to shoot like that?

1291
01:53:46,390 --> 01:53:49,020
Texas. Whoo!

1292
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:11,000
Gone are the dark clouds
that had me blind

1293
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:17,710
It's gonna be
a bright, bright, sunshiny day

1294
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:25,550
It's gonna be
a bright, bright, sunshiny day

1295
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:32,440
I think I can make it
now the pain is gone...

1296
01:54:51,460 --> 01:54:55,330
Hello? Hello. I'm in the trunk.
I'm a police officer.

1297
01:54:56,790 --> 01:55:01,090
The keys are over there.
The keys are over there.

1298
01:55:01,220 --> 01:55:07,470
Look all around,
there's nothin' but blue skies

1299
01:55:08,850 --> 01:55:13,230
Look straight ahead,
nothin' but blue skies

1300
01:55:13,890 --> 01:55:17,310
...DOB 10. 17.55.

1303
01:55:26,780 --> 01:55:31,200
White female. DOB 11.27.56.

1304
01:55:31,830 --> 01:55:37,000
Red hair, green eyes,
5 foot 10 inches tall, 130 pounds.

1305
01:55:37,460 --> 01:55:42,130
Both subjects armed and extremely
dangerous. Approach with caution.

1306
01:55:42,170 --> 01:55:45,090
...New Mexico and Arizona

1307
01:55:45,220 --> 01:55:48,850
for armed robbery, kidnapping
a law-enforcement officer,

1308
01:55:48,970 --> 01:55:51,020
assault with a deadly weapon.

1309
01:55:51,180 --> 01:55:55,310
Suspect driving:
Louise Elizabeth Sawyer, white female...

1310
01:56:14,210 --> 01:56:16,830
Think they saw us?

1311
01:56:19,790 --> 01:56:23,630
I don't know. I don't think so.
We better get off, just in case.

1312
01:57:06,630 --> 01:57:09,050
You got your seat belt on?

1313
01:57:09,180 --> 01:57:13,470
This is 1-12. I am in pursuit of green
Thunderbird. Requesting assistance.

1314
01:57:16,850 --> 01:57:18,560
Oh, shit.

1315
01:57:22,270 --> 01:57:25,480
We have the suspects in sight.
Continuing pursuit.

1316
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:32,950
Remain in position!

1317
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:41,000
I know this whole thing was my fault.

1318
01:57:41,170 --> 01:57:45,300
Damn it, Thelma. You should know
by now, this wasn't your fault.

1319
01:57:45,420 --> 01:57:49,380
Louise, no matter what happens,
I'm glad I came with you.

1320
01:57:50,180 --> 01:57:51,180
Shit.

1321
01:57:57,390 --> 01:57:59,230
Aw, shit!

1322
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:04,980
That guy was right
in the middle of the road!

1323
01:58:18,750 --> 01:58:20,750
Hold on!

1324
01:58:43,310 --> 01:58:45,480
I guess from now on it's gonna get shitty.

1325
01:58:45,610 --> 01:58:46,940
Unbearable, I imagine.

1326
01:58:47,070 --> 01:58:51,150
- Everything we got to lose is gone now.
- Oh, God. How do you stay so positive?

1327
01:59:56,470 --> 01:59:59,760
- You're a good friend.
- You too, sweetie. The best.

1328
02:00:02,600 --> 02:00:05,190
How do you like the vacation so far?

1329
02:00:10,270 --> 02:00:12,360
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?

1330
02:00:12,900 --> 02:00:15,200
No, you've always been crazy.

1331
02:00:15,320 --> 02:00:20,030
This is just the first chance you've
ever had to really express yourself.

1332
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Good drivin'.

1333
02:00:27,830 --> 02:00:29,590
Thanks.

1334
02:01:41,320 --> 02:01:45,700
- Oh, my God.
- What in the hell is this?

1335
02:01:46,700 --> 02:01:51,250
I don't know.
I think it's the goddamn Grand Canyon.

1336
02:01:54,050 --> 02:01:56,510
Isn't it beautiful?

1337
02:01:56,670 --> 02:01:59,880
Yeah. It's somethin' else, all right.

1338
02:03:05,160 --> 02:03:08,450
Oh, my God. It looks like the army.

1339
02:03:08,580 --> 02:03:10,160
All this for us?

1340
02:03:10,290 --> 02:03:15,750
Don't let them shoot those giris. This is
too much. They got guns pointin' at 'em.

1341
02:03:15,880 --> 02:03:18,300
These women are armed, Hal.
This is standard.

1342
02:03:18,420 --> 02:03:20,720
Calm down.
They know what they're doin'.

1343
02:03:22,010 --> 02:03:24,720
Place your hands in plain view!

1344
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:27,390
Any failure to obey that command

1345
02:03:27,510 --> 02:03:31,060
will be considered
an act of aggressión against us!

1346
02:03:34,440 --> 02:03:40,030
I repeat: Turn your engine off
and place your hands in plain view!

1347
02:03:45,450 --> 02:03:48,870
- What are you doin'?
- I'm not givin' up.

1348
02:03:48,990 --> 02:03:51,040
Max, you gotta do somethin'!

1349
02:03:51,160 --> 02:03:54,580
How many times has that woman
got to be fucked over?

1350
02:03:54,710 --> 02:03:58,540
Hey, listen! Pull yourself
together now and listen to me!

1351
02:03:58,670 --> 02:04:00,920
Calm down.
Don't make me sorry I brought you.

1352
02:04:01,090 --> 02:04:02,170
Damn it!

1353
02:04:02,300 --> 02:04:08,720
I repeat: Cut your engine off
and place your hands in plain view!

1354
02:04:14,850 --> 02:04:17,980
OK, then. Listen. Let's not get caught.

1355
02:04:20,020 --> 02:04:22,490
What are you talkin' about?

1356
02:04:23,780 --> 02:04:26,240
Let's keep goin'.

1357
02:04:26,950 --> 02:04:28,990
What do you mean?

1358
02:04:31,700 --> 02:04:32,910
Go.

1359
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:40,750
You sure?

1360
02:04:42,630 --> 02:04:44,260
Yeah.

1361
02:04:44,970 --> 02:04:46,380
Hit it.

1362
02:05:02,440 --> 02:05:03,860
Hey!

1363
02:06:23,810 --> 02:06:27,110
Oooh, ooh ooh

1364
02:06:29,200 --> 02:06:34,160
I felt it when the sun came up
this morning

1365
02:06:36,830 --> 02:06:41,370
I knew I could not wait another day

1366
02:06:44,590 --> 02:06:49,130
Darlin', there is somethin'
I must tell you

1367
02:06:51,880 --> 02:06:56,430
A distant voice is calling me away

1368
02:06:59,390 --> 02:07:03,940
Until we find the bridge across forever

1369
02:07:06,940 --> 02:07:11,490
Until this grand illusión brings us home

1370
02:07:14,660 --> 02:07:19,200
You and I will always be together

1371
02:07:22,040 --> 02:07:26,710
From this day on you'll never walk alone

1372
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:32,510
You're a part of me

1373
02:07:33,590 --> 02:07:36,050
I'm a part of you

1374
02:07:37,140 --> 02:07:40,020
Wherever we may travel

1375
02:07:40,850 --> 02:07:43,560
Whatever we go through

1376
02:07:44,650 --> 02:07:48,150
Whatever time may take away

1377
02:07:48,570 --> 02:07:51,740
It cannot change the way we feel today

1378
02:07:52,240 --> 02:07:56,780
So hold me close and say you feel it too

1379
02:07:59,790 --> 02:08:04,540
You're part of me and I am part of you

1380
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:15,970
I can hear it when I stand
beside the river

1381
02:08:18,430 --> 02:08:23,180
I can see it when I look up in the sky

1382
02:08:25,940 --> 02:08:31,610
I can feel it when I hear
that lonesome highway

1383
02:08:33,490 --> 02:08:38,280
So many miles to go before I die

1384
02:08:41,490 --> 02:08:46,000
We can never know about tomorrow

1385
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:53,340
Still we have to choose which way to go

1386
02:08:56,550 --> 02:09:01,220
You and I are standing
at the crossroads

1387
02:09:04,100 --> 02:09:09,150
Darlin', there is one thing
you should know

1388
02:09:11,690 --> 02:09:13,940
You're a part of me

1389
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:17,700
I'm a part of you...

1390
02:09:22,410 --> 02:09:25,080
