1
00:00:54,292 --> 00:00:58,458
INSPIRED BY REAL EVENTS

2
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:28,833
Kim!

3
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:55,125
Kim?

4
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:09,500
Kim!

5
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:14,209
Kim! No!

6
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,083
Kim!

7
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,334
Kim!

8
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:29,583
THE EVIL NEXT DOOR

9
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,333
What are you thinking about?

10
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:07,625
You.

11
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,875
And how great this is going to be for us.

12
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:15,917
- Maybe we should see the place first.
- Yeah, obviously, but...

13
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,875
- I just know it's right. I can feel it.
- Me too.

14
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:29,167
Daddy. My ship is full of dragons.

15
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:36,500
All right, then my ship
is full of... dragons... spaceships!

16
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:39,792
My ship is full of spuds.

17
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,291
It's your turn. Come on.

18
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:49,125
Okay. My ship is full of... cars.

19
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,167
- No. You're out.
- What? Why?

20
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,583
Your word has to start with the last one.

21
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,708
The last what?

22
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:58,500
The last letter. He said "spuds,"
so that gives you S.

23
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:03,416
Okay, I'll start over.
My ship is full of... screws.

24
00:05:03,667 --> 00:05:06,917
- My ship is full of stew!
- My ship is full of...

25
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:08,792
water!

26
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,959
If you and my dad buy the house...

27
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,500
does that make you my new mommy?

28
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,250
No, I mean...

29
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,125
It's actually more like...

30
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:49,416
Does that mean you're going to die, too?

31
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,500
I was on P, right?

32
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,084
My ship is full of... poop!

33
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:10,708
That sounds like a gross ship!
I don't want to sail on that.

34
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:13,000
I think I'll catch a flight, thanks.

35
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:38,959
- Hey there!
- Hello.

36
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,667
- Hi!
- Erik.

37
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,542
- I'm Shirin.
- Nice to meet you. Welcome!

38
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,917
- So this is it.
- It's great.

39
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,750
- And you've brought the little guy. Hi!
- This is Lucas.

40
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,458
Great.

41
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:54,917
I'll just unlock the door
and you guys can have a look around.

42
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:59,208
Check it out. Wow. It's awesome.

43
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,667
- I didn't realize it was a duplex.
- Me neither. Let's go.

44
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:08,542
Excuse me?
Is there no one living next door?

45
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:11,291
No, the house is unoccupied.

46
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:22,917
Lucas?

47
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,542
The previous owners renovated the place

48
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,667
and knocked down a wall here to make
the kitchen and living room open plan.

49
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:44,333
So you get tons of amazing natural light.

50
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:49,583
In my opinion,
you can't go wrong with an open layout.

51
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,082
Hello?

52
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,208
There you are!

53
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,083
- Check this out.
- What a great room.

54
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:16,792
A child lives in here.

55
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:18,875
A child probably used to live here, yeah.

56
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,250
We'll see,
maybe this can be your room now.

57
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:44,500
- So, we're buying the house, right?
- Yeah, let's do it.

58
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:49,875
We're buying a house.

59
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:01,834
FRIDAY, 26 SEPTEMBER 2014

60
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,166
Go on, take that inside.

61
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,667
He's a huge help. He carried a teddy bear.

62
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:07,834
Great.

63
00:10:10,292 --> 00:10:12,667
- Take these boxes.
- Okay.

64
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,208
This looks like old baby stuff.

65
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,292
Yeah, we don't need it anymore.

66
00:10:21,417 --> 00:10:23,458
- There's no hole there. How do I...
- Daddy!

67
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,875
Yikes, buddy!

68
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:31,000
I thought you were going to help me
put this stuff together. You promised.

69
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:35,083
Do you know what happens when...
Hey...

70
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:57,000
Just be careful, you've got this.
Do you want me to help?

71
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,375
Yes.

72
00:10:58,709 --> 00:10:59,667
Come here.

73
00:11:00,542 --> 00:11:02,834
There we go. I'll put it here.

74
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,834
Take a sip, so you don't spill.

75
00:11:09,542 --> 00:11:10,500
Cheers!

76
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,709
Hey! I'm great, how are you?

77
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:36,375
Wow! Yeah, totally.
The only thing is that we just moved away.

78
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,041
Hi.

79
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:14,375
Hey? Can you come down here?
I need to talk to you about something.

80
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:16,625
Okay.

81
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:31,875
I'd have to spend weeknights away
for a while, leaving you two alone here,

82
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:36,000
and leaving you to look after the house
and Lucas... I don't know.

83
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:39,292
You have to take the job. We'll be fine.

84
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:42,708
- Are you sure?
- Daddy?

85
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,333
- Yes, I'm sure.
- Come here, Daddy!

86
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:48,292
Lucas, just a second! I'll be right there.

87
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:51,916
Tell them yes.

88
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:54,167
Okay, I will.

89
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,375
- Daddy!
- All right, I'm coming!

90
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:03,375
- Where are you going to be?
- I have to be at work.

91
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:04,791
But Shirin is going to be here,

92
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:09,083
so you'll have an awesome time.
Okay? Good.

93
00:14:09,334 --> 00:14:13,584
Now, let's get some sleep, shall we?
Scoot over.

94
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:18,125
- Can you sing Mommy's song?
- Mommy's song? Of course.

95
00:14:21,584 --> 00:14:22,542
Good night, Lucas.

96
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:27,708
<i>- Good thing that I have you, my sweet
- Good thing that I have you, my sweet</i>

97
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:32,625
<i>- Good thing that I have you, my sweet
- Good thing that I have you, my sweet</i>

98
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:37,875
<i>- Good thing that we have us, my sweet
- Good thing that we have us, my sweet</i>

99
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:43,208
<i>- We make each other complete
- We make each other complete</i>

100
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:48,375

101
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:52,916
<i>And be together, you and me...</i>

102
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:04,208
SUNDAY, 5 OCTOBER 2014

103
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:09,542
- See you, buddy.
- Bye, Daddy.

104
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,125
See you in a few days.

105
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:15,250
- Bye.
- Bye.

106
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,791
Drive safe, okay?

107
00:16:21,292 --> 00:16:22,250
Hello?

108
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,958
Yes, I want to play.

109
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,000
No, I wasn't scared.

110
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,416
He's not here right now.

111
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,500
No, I'm alone.

112
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:42,666
Do you live in there?

113
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:44,917
Lucas?

114
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,583
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

115
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,625
Okay, but it's time for bed.

116
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,666
Can I sleep in the big bed?

117
00:18:57,334 --> 00:18:59,708
We all agreed that you should sleep
in your own room, remember?

118
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:02,583
- Please?
- No.

119
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,042
- Good night.
- Good night.

120
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,416
Sleep tight.

121
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:11,292
Hey.

122
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,541
Can a dead person come back?

123
00:19:20,334 --> 00:19:26,000
Well, some believe that people
keep existing even after they die,

124
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,666
but, like, in a different place.

125
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,000
No, that's not what I mean.

126
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:34,292
I mean, can they come back here?

127
00:19:36,084 --> 00:19:37,042
To us?

128
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:41,917
No.

129
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:44,833
No, they can't.

130
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:56,292
Is this about your mom?

131
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,209
No.

132
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,541
- Hi.
- Hi!

133
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:29,500
<i>- Everything okay?
</i>- Sure.

134
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,291
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

135
00:20:34,084 --> 00:20:36,084
No. Nothing's wrong. It's just...

136
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:40,084
<i>- It's just what?
</i>- Lucas, he...

137
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:43,792
<i>He talked about his mom.</i>

138
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,209
- <i>Okay.
</i>- And...

139
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:51,084
I'm just struggling a little
with all of this.

140
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:52,917
<i>I don't feel like...</i>

141
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:54,541
Okay.

142
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,959
I don't know if I can... if I...

143
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,833
<i>Babe, everything's going to be okay.
We all just need time to adjust.</i>

144
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:05,583
You know what? You're right.

145
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,583
Everything is going to be okay.

146
00:21:09,209 --> 00:21:10,375
<i>I just need time to adjust.</i>

147
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,875
Okay. I have to go, babe.
I'll talk to you later. Kisses.

148
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:16,250
Kisses.

149
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,959
TUESDAY, 7 OCTOBER 2014

150
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:08,333
This is Shirin.

151
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:11,084
Hi.

152
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,458
Damn it.

153
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:30,291
- Hi!
- Hi.

154
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:32,959
- I'm so sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.

155
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,792
Lucas had a great day.
It was his turn to tell a story.

156
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,291
Okay.

157
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,333
And he told everyone about his new friend.

158
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:42,625
Oh?

159
00:23:43,084 --> 00:23:44,792
Yeah, the kid next door.

160
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:00,375
Hi, Lucas.

161
00:24:01,834 --> 00:24:02,792
I'm sorry I'm late.

162
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:35,834
- Can we play a game?
- No, it's time for bed.

163
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,750
Just for a little while?

164
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:41,792
Go brush your teeth.
I'll be up in a minute.

165
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:31,291
Lucas?

166
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:40,000
Hello?

167
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:50,500
Lucas?

168
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:08,292
Hello?

169
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,458
What are you up to?

170
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:41,750
Stop it. Just come out.

171
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:51,875
Lucas!

172
00:26:58,958 --> 00:26:59,916
Yes?

173
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:02,250
Jesus, you scared me!

174
00:27:03,792 --> 00:27:04,916
What are you doing?

175
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,083
We're playing.

176
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:11,292
Okay.

177
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:16,417
Come on. Brush your teeth.

178
00:27:19,916 --> 00:27:25,625
"And all the animals gathered
in the clearing for a celebration,

179
00:27:25,834 --> 00:27:28,709
because they thought
the troll was finally gone for good."

180
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:31,667
But was it, do you think?

181
00:27:33,292 --> 00:27:34,375
To be continued.

182
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:39,792
Can you sing me the song?

183
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:45,875
No, I... I don't know that song.

184
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:51,333
And I think that should be something
special for just you and your dad.

185
00:27:58,542 --> 00:27:59,500
Good night.

186
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,709
THURSDAY, 9 OCTOBER 2014

187
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:10,000
Watch out! I'm coming to get you!

188
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:15,417
- Hi!
- Hi.

189
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,375
Where do they get their energy from?

190
00:28:21,417 --> 00:28:22,833
Sit down on the swing, Tilda.

191
00:28:26,542 --> 00:28:28,750
So are you new to the neighborhood?

192
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:31,667
Yeah, we are. We just moved in.

193
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,750
- Oh...
- Mom, push me higher!

194
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:38,333
- Higher!
- Okay.

195
00:28:39,292 --> 00:28:40,250
Are you ready to go?

196
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,709
I lost my shoes!

197
00:28:46,916 --> 00:28:48,791
I lost my shoes! No!

198
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,083
One...

199
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:00,375
two...

200
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:04,459
three... four...

201
00:29:05,459 --> 00:29:06,750
five...

202
00:29:07,709 --> 00:29:11,459
six... seven...

203
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:16,417
eight... nine...

204
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:19,791
ten! Ready or not, here I come!

205
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,417
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

206
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,833
You know there's no boy
living next door, right?

207
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:42,083
- Yes, there is!
- No, there isn't.

208
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:44,041
He comes over to play.

209
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:47,041
You are mean.

210
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:53,667
- Lucas, listen to me. There's no...
- You're not my mother!

211
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:11,833
One... two...

212
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:17,167
three... four...

213
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:22,333
five... six...

214
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:27,791
seven... eight...

215
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:32,958
nine... ten!

216
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:35,042
Ready or not, here I come!

217
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:41,042
Where are you?

218
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:52,791
Are you in here?

219
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:22,584
Are you up there?

220
00:32:27,334 --> 00:32:28,625
Where are you? Are you in here?

221
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,708
Lucas?

222
00:32:34,334 --> 00:32:36,292
Oh, Lucas, what happened?

223
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,958
Lucas, did something happen?

224
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,708
Okay, calm down. Come here.

225
00:32:43,292 --> 00:32:46,917
It's okay. The door just slammed shut.

226
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:50,083
There's nothing to be scared of.

227
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:23,500
He's coming!

228
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:35,167
It's him.

229
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:37,666
The bogeyman.

230
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,625
- No.
- Yeah, nothing.

231
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:28,000
- Hi! Are you okay?
- Yeah.

232
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,458
- Hi!
- Hi.

233
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:34,667
There are no signs of a break-in
and no response when we knock.

234
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:39,125
- Have you lived here long?
- No.

235
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:42,291
Houses make all sorts of noises
for all sorts of reasons.

236
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,416
- So there's no one in there?
- No.

237
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,625
But I saw a child in there.

238
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:53,209
Well, the place is empty now,
so there's nothing more we can do. Okay?

239
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:57,792
He's freezing.
Why doesn't he have a coat on?

240
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:14,667
- Up here?
- Yeah, right there.

241
00:38:17,042 --> 00:38:19,875
I mean... maybe he was right.

242
00:38:20,084 --> 00:38:24,167
It's a house with noisy plumbing.
It could just be the house settling.

243
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:27,792
No, someone was knocking!
And I saw someone in there.

244
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,250
Some kids probably just snuck in,

245
00:38:35,084 --> 00:38:38,291
or it was just dark
and you were a little worked up.

246
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:47,042
Listen, I'll take tomorrow off and stay.
And then it'll be the weekend.

247
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,875
- No, you don't have to do that.
- I want to.

248
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,500
I don't want you to be afraid.

249
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:24,875
Oh, God! Watch out or I'll eat you.
Oh, no!

250
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:36,125
Oh, wow, you scared me!

251
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:43,125
Hey, I just folded all this laundry.
You're making the clothes all wrinkly.

252
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:45,208
Come on, six!

253
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:48,792
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Nothing.

254
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,458
- Are you trying to cheat?
- No, I just stroked Lucas's face.

255
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:52,625
Are you two in cahoots?

256
00:39:52,834 --> 00:39:53,792
- No.
- No.

257
00:39:53,917 --> 00:39:55,667
- What's that behind your back?
- Air?

258
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:59,291
- I know you've got something there!
- No, I don't!

259
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:03,583
- I don't have anything!
- What kind of example are you setting?

260
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:06,834
The example of a dad who cheats at games!

261
00:40:07,084 --> 00:40:08,583
- Here.
- No!

262
00:40:08,792 --> 00:40:13,208
<i>- Every day we get to meet
- Every day we get to meet</i>

263
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:18,834
<i>- And be together, you and me
- And be together, you and me</i>

264
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:21,084
<i>- Because...
- Because...</i>

265
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:22,959
I just wanted to say good night.

266
00:40:23,542 --> 00:40:25,333
- Good night.
- Good night.

267
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:31,125
<i>- Because no one, I said no one
- Because no one, I said no one</i>

268
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:36,750
<i>- Wants to be alone
- Wants to be alone</i>

269
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:38,583
Good night.

270
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:40,750
Maybe we'll get a juice box.

271
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:43,333
Hold it! Are you licensed
to operate this thing?

272
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:48,042
You need a wheelbarrow license, see.
Hey, there's a speed limit here!

273
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:56,000
Hey! You little rascal!

274
00:40:56,834 --> 00:40:57,792
Come here!

275
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,959
- Hi.
- Hi!

276
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:05,709
- How are things?
- Good.

277
00:41:05,959 --> 00:41:07,875
I'm actually having a great time.

278
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:10,417
Julia, would you move your car
to let us out?

279
00:41:10,625 --> 00:41:13,959
- Sure. By the way, this is...
- Shirin.

280
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:18,375
- Hi, I'm Sofie.
- They bought Peter and Jenny's house.

281
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:20,792
You know what happened there, right?

282
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:26,041
Actually, you and I don't know either,
so... See you around.

283
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:27,875
What do you mean? What happened?

284
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Well, they had only just moved in,
and then their child went missing.

285
00:41:35,959 --> 00:41:37,875
- Missing?
- Julia?

286
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:24,166
MONDAY, 13 OCTOBER 2014

287
00:45:42,916 --> 00:45:47,250
Listen, you can stay with me tonight,
in the big bed.

288
00:45:48,667 --> 00:45:49,625
Now spit.

289
00:46:03,083 --> 00:46:04,041
Wake up.

290
00:46:07,916 --> 00:46:09,625
Wake up.

291
00:46:13,916 --> 00:46:15,833
Okay, Lucas, I'm coming.

292
00:46:44,208 --> 00:46:47,167
Please, help me.

293
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,042
Help me...

294
00:51:18,666 --> 00:51:19,625
Lucas!

295
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:22,958
Lucas!

296
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:25,917
Lucas? What happened?

297
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,583
He tried to take me.

298
00:51:29,541 --> 00:51:33,875
TUESDAY, 14 OCTOBER 2014

299
00:51:43,666 --> 00:51:46,250
- You're not even listening to me.
- I am listening.

300
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:48,833
I just don't get it.

301
00:51:50,042 --> 00:51:51,708
Why did you leave Lucas on his own?

302
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,292
This is messed up.

303
00:51:58,666 --> 00:52:02,292
Someone broke in and hurt him.

304
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:05,209
It wasn't some random intruder!
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

305
00:52:06,875 --> 00:52:08,541
Something is seriously fucked up here.

306
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,125
Hey, buddy. Come here.

307
00:52:23,084 --> 00:52:25,292
Come to Daddy.

308
00:52:26,917 --> 00:52:27,875
Are you okay?

309
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:38,334
Let me see. Is your arm okay?

310
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:56,375
SIX-YEAR-OLD MISSING

311
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,833
I'm going out for a bit.

312
00:53:32,917 --> 00:53:36,375
Okay, but tell me who hurt you.

313
00:53:42,792 --> 00:53:43,750
Buddy?

314
00:53:46,541 --> 00:53:48,291
Can you please tell me
what really happened?

315
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:54,625
Is Shirin nice to you?

316
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:48,416
- Hello. Can I help you?
- I'm looking for Peter Lindwall.

317
00:54:48,875 --> 00:54:49,833
You found him.

318
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:54,000
- We bought the house from you.
- Okay?

319
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:56,042
And...

320
00:54:57,667 --> 00:54:59,042
Well, I heard what happened to you.

321
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,959
Ever since we moved in,
strange things have been happening.

322
00:55:05,167 --> 00:55:06,542
So, what do you want?

323
00:55:09,084 --> 00:55:12,250
I think it could have something to do
with what happened to Kim.

324
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:18,875
What happened was that my wife
became mentally ill.

325
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,208
She had these crazy notions...

326
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:29,583
about the house next door,
saying it was...

327
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:34,583
it was...

328
00:55:40,917 --> 00:55:42,042
What did she say about the house?

329
00:55:49,416 --> 00:55:52,625
She said there was something
in that house that wanted Kim.

330
00:55:56,291 --> 00:55:57,792
I have to talk to her.

331
00:56:00,375 --> 00:56:01,708
Can you please ask her to call me?

332
00:56:05,792 --> 00:56:06,750
Please.

333
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:29,708
- Hey. Where were you?
- Hey.

334
00:56:30,959 --> 00:56:33,458
I went to see the guy
we bought the house from.

335
00:56:34,917 --> 00:56:39,250
Things happened to the family
that lived here before us, too.

336
00:56:45,792 --> 00:56:48,792
I talked to Robban
and I quit the project.

337
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,416
They can find someone else.

338
00:56:54,208 --> 00:56:57,125
I just need to go back
to tie up some loose ends.

339
00:56:58,084 --> 00:56:59,708
I'll be home tomorrow.

340
00:57:02,417 --> 00:57:03,834
Okay, I'll call you later.

341
00:57:31,083 --> 00:57:34,917
You know the little boy
that you play with...

342
00:57:36,875 --> 00:57:39,083
is his name Kim?

343
00:57:50,792 --> 00:57:54,208
What does he want, Lucas? Do you know?

344
00:57:54,667 --> 00:57:55,875
He wants to play.

345
00:58:00,125 --> 00:58:01,375
And he's nice.

346
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:05,208
Okay.

347
00:58:05,959 --> 00:58:07,542
But he's afraid of the bogeyman.

348
00:58:14,917 --> 00:58:17,959
He doesn't want
the bogeyman to get me, too.

349
00:58:28,875 --> 00:58:29,834
Come here.

350
00:58:34,291 --> 00:58:35,250
Look at me.

351
00:58:36,417 --> 00:58:37,792
No one is going to hurt you.

352
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:01,916
Please, help me.

353
01:03:07,584 --> 01:03:08,542
Stay here.

354
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:03,708
Kim?

355
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:12,250
He...

356
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:17,125
is...

357
01:04:19,459 --> 01:04:20,417
here!

358
01:04:43,083 --> 01:04:44,042
Lucas!

359
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:27,208
There you are.

360
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Oh, sweetie! What the hell?

361
01:05:31,875 --> 01:05:33,459
Let me see. Come here.

362
01:05:34,708 --> 01:05:37,542
What the hell happened? Let me see.

363
01:05:40,125 --> 01:05:41,292
What the fuck did you do?

364
01:05:44,042 --> 01:05:45,000
Oh, sweetheart.

365
01:05:45,334 --> 01:05:46,459
- Lucas?
- That's us.

366
01:05:46,666 --> 01:05:47,625
Follow me.

367
01:06:06,459 --> 01:06:11,125
WEDNESDAY, 15 OCTOBER 2014

368
01:06:33,125 --> 01:06:34,083
Lucas...

369
01:06:38,917 --> 01:06:40,958
- Your dad doesn't believe us.
- Stop it.

370
01:06:41,167 --> 01:06:43,875
Don't leave him on his own!
Something is coming for him.

371
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:46,583
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Fredrik, please...

372
01:06:46,791 --> 01:06:48,500
You're scaring him.

373
01:06:49,042 --> 01:06:51,500
You have to believe me!
I know it sounds crazy, but...

374
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:54,209
No, you sound crazy!

375
01:07:02,292 --> 01:07:04,958
You're the one who's been hurting him.

376
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:56,209
This is Shirin.

377
01:07:58,500 --> 01:07:59,458
Hello?

378
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:24,958
Hello. Come on in.

379
01:08:32,291 --> 01:08:33,792
I think I know why you're here.

380
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:49,334
Do you have kids?

381
01:08:56,124 --> 01:08:59,166
Lucas. He's five.

382
01:09:00,624 --> 01:09:01,582
Kim...

383
01:09:05,249 --> 01:09:07,209
was about to turn six, when...

384
01:09:41,292 --> 01:09:42,250
There's...

385
01:09:43,583 --> 01:09:45,292
there's something in that house.

386
01:09:51,791 --> 01:09:53,458
That something took my daughter.

387
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:56,084
Kim.

388
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:03,750
Then who's the little boy who...

389
01:10:06,917 --> 01:10:09,541
That's him.
The one who takes the children.

390
01:10:59,458 --> 01:11:00,416
Fredrik!

391
01:11:04,209 --> 01:11:05,167
Fredrik!

392
01:11:06,583 --> 01:11:08,333
- What do you want?
- Where's Lucas?

393
01:11:08,541 --> 01:11:09,500
He's sleeping.

394
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,042
Do you want to play with me?

395
01:11:55,625 --> 01:12:00,042
Come play with me...

396
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:15,708
Lucas!

397
01:12:28,667 --> 01:12:29,625
Lucas?

398
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:34,208
That's not him!

399
01:12:38,208 --> 01:12:39,166
Fredrik!

400
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:56,166
Help!

401
01:13:00,458 --> 01:13:02,333
Lucas! No!

402
01:13:31,959 --> 01:13:32,917
Lucas?

403
01:14:03,708 --> 01:14:04,667
Lucas?

404
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:17,208
Lucas?

405
01:16:57,709 --> 01:17:00,958
Sleep...

406
01:17:08,083 --> 01:17:09,041
No!

407
01:17:12,834 --> 01:17:15,500
Go to sleep.

408
01:17:17,958 --> 01:17:18,916
Leave him alone.

409
01:17:37,375 --> 01:17:39,667
He belongs to me.

410
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:49,417
I am not afraid of you.
I am not afraid of you.

411
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:04,792
He already has a mother.

412
01:18:23,375 --> 01:18:26,458
You have never cared about him.

413
01:18:28,417 --> 01:18:31,250
He belongs to me!

414
01:19:05,916 --> 01:19:09,250
It's time for you to go to sleep, too.

415
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:41,709
Lucas belongs to me.
He's mine. I love him!

416
01:19:49,584 --> 01:19:51,833
Lucas belongs to me.
You'll never have him!

417
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:57,958
He's mine!

418
01:20:15,791 --> 01:20:16,750
Lucas?

419
01:20:19,292 --> 01:20:21,083
Lucas! Lucas?

420
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:24,208
Lucas?

421
01:20:27,042 --> 01:20:28,000
Lucas...

422
01:20:34,459 --> 01:20:35,417
Oh, God!

423
01:20:41,625 --> 01:20:42,584
Lucas...

424
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:52,250
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

425
01:21:08,375 --> 01:21:12,000
<i>Good thing that I have you, my sweet</i>

426
01:21:16,459 --> 01:21:19,542
<i>Good thing that I have you, my sweet</i>

427
01:21:26,334 --> 01:21:29,375
<i>Good thing that we have us, my sweet</i>

428
01:21:33,417 --> 01:21:36,167
<i>We make each other complete</i>

429
01:21:39,417 --> 01:21:42,459
<i>Every day we get to meet</i>

430
01:21:44,167 --> 01:21:46,916
<i>And be together, you and me</i>

431
01:21:49,542 --> 01:21:54,334
<i>Because no one, I said no one</i>

432
01:21:54,584 --> 01:21:57,334
<i>Wants to be alone</i>

433
01:22:06,292 --> 01:22:07,250
Lucas?

434
01:22:08,417 --> 01:22:10,334
I knew you'd come.
