1
00:00:40,214 --> 00:00:41,824
Can you see it?

2
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:44,479
Uh, yeah, a little,
but it looks good.

3
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:48,048
All right,
can you slate for me? Mm-hmm.

4
00:00:49,397 --> 00:00:51,225
All right,
whenever you"re ready.

5
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,923
Mmm, okay.

6
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:59,146
Uh, we are here in the beautiful
Denny"s in Scottsdale, Arizona,

7
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,107
and I am about to meet my first
biological relative, Samuel.

8
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:06,153
Samuel.Samuel.

9
00:01:06,327 --> 00:01:09,286
You gonna tell them about all the
drunken nights here at this booth?

10
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,942
You do not...
You keep your mouth shut. Grand Slam.

11
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:14,335
I think that"s him.

12
00:01:15,423 --> 00:01:17,512
You think that"s him? Mm-hmm.

13
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:24,040
Yeah, he"s trying to pay the Uber
with cash. That"s definitely him.

14
00:01:30,002 --> 00:01:31,874
Samuel? Yeah, it"s me.

15
00:01:32,048 --> 00:01:33,093
Margot.

16
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:35,356
Cool.

17
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,835
Wow.Wow.

18
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:40,796
Oh, this is crazy.
Sorry. No, no, I"m...

19
00:01:41,927 --> 00:01:43,842
uh, at a loss for words myself.

20
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:47,759
Are you hungry? Yeah, yeah.

21
00:01:49,152 --> 00:01:50,632
Is that...

22
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:53,330
Yeah, it"s Chris.
Hey. How you doing?

23
00:01:53,504 --> 00:01:57,378
So, you said that
this is gonna be a documentary?

24
00:01:57,552 --> 00:02:02,078
Yeah. It"s weird. I never thought I
would ever do anything about myself.

25
00:02:02,252 --> 00:02:04,907
Feels kind of self-indulgent,

26
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:08,258
but Chris pushed me to do it.

27
00:02:08,432 --> 00:02:10,173
Her story"s too good.

28
00:02:10,347 --> 00:02:13,002
Some waters for you. Thank you.

29
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:16,397
Thank you.

30
00:02:18,355 --> 00:02:20,792
I"ve actually, uh,
never, uh, been...

31
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,796
in front of a camera before.

32
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:27,669
Any camera?

33
00:02:27,843 --> 00:02:29,932
Yeah. What?

34
00:02:30,106 --> 00:02:34,676
Yeah, we"re typically not supposed
to be, um... photographed,

35
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,592
"cause, you know,
uh, vanity is a sin.

36
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:39,202
Ah. Right, right.

37
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:42,640
But there are exceptions,
if our elders condone it.

38
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:45,600
Yeah, you had said on the phone
that you left the community.

39
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:46,774
Right? Yeah.

40
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:48,907
And how long ago has it been?

41
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:51,301
About...

42
00:02:53,303 --> 00:02:55,479
seven months, I think.

43
00:02:55,653 --> 00:02:57,786
Is this weird
for your adopted parents?

44
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,659
It is, but could I have gone
on living the rest of my life

45
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,096
not finding out
who my real family was?

46
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:06,273
Yeah, it"d be fine,

47
00:03:06,447 --> 00:03:12,844
but I think for a lot of us people who
have been given up by their parents,

48
00:03:13,018 --> 00:03:14,585
there"s always
something missing.

49
00:03:16,805 --> 00:03:22,593
Anyway, to find out where I come
from would be really special for me.

50
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:24,291
Absolutely.

51
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:25,857
Hopefully I can help.

52
00:03:27,294 --> 00:03:29,861
How do you even meet
an Amish dude on 23andMe?

53
00:03:30,035 --> 00:03:32,647
Isn"t that
against the rules? He"s on his Rumspringa.

54
00:03:32,821 --> 00:03:34,736
What "s that? It"s basically like a year

55
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,217
where they get to see the
outside world for themselves.

56
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:40,307
So he was floating around,
you know, taking odd jobs.

57
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:43,745
Then he meets this woman
and builds her a pen...

58
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:44,920
Chicken coop.

59
00:03:45,094 --> 00:03:47,009
Thank you. Chicken coop.
Correct.

60
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:50,621
Basically, she becomes obsessed with him.
More of a cat-lady type, yeah.

61
00:03:50,795 --> 00:03:52,710
Do you wanna tell the story?

62
00:03:52,884 --> 00:03:55,104
My bad, my bad.
I "m sorry." Cause you can if you want.

63
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:58,890
Anyway, so basically
she"s bragging to him

64
00:03:59,064 --> 00:04:01,937
about how she"s 25% Cherokee
or whatever

65
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:04,461
and tells him about
the online DNA test you can do.

66
00:04:04,635 --> 00:04:08,291
So he gets one,
gets a match... it"s me.

67
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:10,467
She"s Amish.

68
00:04:10,641 --> 00:04:12,687
I am not Amish. You are Amish.

69
00:04:12,861 --> 00:04:13,862
Not how that works.

70
00:04:15,864 --> 00:04:17,387
You got this from the hospital?

71
00:04:19,215 --> 00:04:22,262
I can"t believe anyone would just
abandon their baby like that.

72
00:04:23,654 --> 00:04:25,439
This must have been
so intense for you.

73
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:30,444
Yeah, I"ve probably watched
that video over a hundred times,

74
00:04:30,618 --> 00:04:32,794
and I get a new question
every time I watch it.

75
00:04:32,968 --> 00:04:35,579
Like, why did she do it?

76
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:40,236
Why did she drive so far
away just to abandon me?

77
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:45,546
Is she even still alive?
You know.

78
00:04:48,244 --> 00:04:51,508
What I think is weird about it
is the way that she"s holding me.

79
00:04:51,682 --> 00:04:54,946
Like, looking around
like she"s scared.

80
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:00,038
Maybe she was just worried
she was gonna get caught.

81
00:05:00,212 --> 00:05:03,520
Guilt, yeah? Yeah, I mean,
that"s what I think.

82
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:05,217
Maybe.

83
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:06,741
I don"t know.

84
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:20,015
Attention, all passengers
in the baggage claim area.

85
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:23,018
Delta would like to welcome you
to Buffalo, New York.

86
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:29,241
My signature shot.
Spaz.

87
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,679
Here, I got it.

88
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:33,507
Damn. Kid is strong.

89
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:36,771
You know, farm labor. You get
used to moving heavy stuff.

90
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:39,774
Thanks. What is this stuff?

91
00:05:39,948 --> 00:05:41,079
Magic, baby.

92
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:43,517
Lipstick cam, drone, LEDs.

93
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:47,303
We"re not fucking around
over here. Yeah, clearly not. Okay.

94
00:05:47,477 --> 00:05:51,438
Uh, our sound guy said
he"d be in a green van.

95
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:52,612
Oh. Right there.

96
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,701
Hey.

97
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,006
Yes.

98
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:03,537
Hey. Hey... Oh.

99
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:05,713
Airport. Sorry, mask.
I got it. Sick.

100
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:11,632
Hey. Are you Dale?

101
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:12,806
Yeah. Hey, I"m Margot.

102
00:06:12,937 --> 00:06:15,244
This is Chris, our DP.Hey.

103
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:16,941
This is Sam.Hey. Dale, Sam.

104
00:06:17,115 --> 00:06:19,115
Thank you so much
for picking up the van. Of course.

105
00:06:19,204 --> 00:06:20,728
Let"s get you guys loaded up.

106
00:06:20,902 --> 00:06:23,121
It was his first flight ever,
actually.

107
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:24,427
First flight ever? Yeah.

108
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:25,602
Yeah. No shit!

109
00:06:25,776 --> 00:06:27,952
That"s a great camera.

110
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:35,830
Make yourselves
comfortable. Yeah, thank you.

111
00:06:36,004 --> 00:06:39,094
We all got tested.
Are you okay if we... Oh, yeah, yeah.

112
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:41,531
I got COVID, like, five times.

113
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:43,141
All good, baby.

114
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:45,274
Really? Yeah.

115
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:48,209
I mean, it was diagnosed once, but I
think I kept getting it after that.

116
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:51,193
Yeah, I don"t know.
My body is weird, but I"m alive.

117
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:53,587
Seriously, thank you so much
for getting us there.

118
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:56,285
Yeah, of course. I had nothing
going on, so this is great for me.

119
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:59,114
There"s so much more snow
up here.

120
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:01,464
Oh, yeah.
Weather changes every day.

121
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:03,945
One day you got snow,
next it"s slush.

122
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:05,990
That"s why you gotta do
these zip off...

123
00:07:06,164 --> 00:07:08,166
I do all my pants
with zip offs, so it"s...

124
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,386
You got pants.
Oh, it"s too hot out?

125
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,649
Now you got shorts, baby.

126
00:07:12,823 --> 00:07:16,871
I"ll show you when we get in. I"ll
throw the legs on, dude. It rules.

127
00:07:17,045 --> 00:07:20,352
And I gotta say, easy access for
the ladies, if you know what I mean.

128
00:07:20,527 --> 00:07:23,181
Okay. Hey, look at that.

129
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:25,401
What?

130
00:07:37,065 --> 00:07:39,023
What"s going through your head?

131
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,592
I"m nervous, but excited.

132
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:04,266
Okay,
so just past the barn here.

133
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,702
The turnoff here.

134
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:08,879
You have any service here? Uh, nope.

135
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:11,142
Yeah, me either.

136
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:12,753
Christ.

137
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:14,276
Slow, slow, slow.

138
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,932
Okay, and you can stop here.

139
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:21,762
Okay. Wow, it"s so cute.

140
00:08:23,024 --> 00:08:24,591
Oh, um...

141
00:08:24,765 --> 00:08:27,463
You guys, actually,
just give me a second here.

142
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:29,247
I"ll be back in one second.

143
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Samuel!

144
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:02,803
Eli, go back in the house.

145
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,762
Oh, God.

146
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:11,420
That doesn"t look great.

147
00:09:16,207 --> 00:09:17,339
Okay.

148
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:26,957
All right, guys, uh...

149
00:09:28,524 --> 00:09:29,612
bad news.

150
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:38,708
So you didn"t think to call ahead
and let them know we were coming?

151
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:42,233
They"re fucking Amish, dude.
They don"t have a phone.

152
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:43,495
Oh.

153
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,236
Right.Yeah.

154
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:48,936
Two beds.

155
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:52,983
Okay, we"re gonna
have to figure that out.

156
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:55,377
Goddamn.

157
00:09:55,551 --> 00:09:57,751
You gotta teach me how you do this.
Do you have a system?

158
00:09:57,858 --> 00:10:02,036
Yeah, just make a list, account for it,
make sure you put it in the right spot.

159
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,865
That blue one actually goes
right there in that corner.

160
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,170
There you go.Awesome.

161
00:10:06,344 --> 00:10:08,477
Yeah, you know,
it"s pretty easy.

162
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:10,784
Man! GoPro.

163
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,916
These rule.
Love these.

164
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,919
You can get them filthy, you can toss
them around, you can get them wet.

165
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,880
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, you can do...

166
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:22,970
Yeah, you can do a lot with the GoPros.
Yeah, you"re right.

167
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,891
You missed it.

168
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:35,069
I mean, like, maybe this is
gonna be a process. You know?

169
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:40,161
Maybe Sam can go back tomorrow
and try again.

170
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:42,859
I mean, he left "em.

171
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:44,731
They probably don"t
even want him back.Shh.

172
00:10:44,905 --> 00:10:46,341
Stop. I"m just saying.

173
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:48,996
Keep your voice down. We might have to
adopt him.

174
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,998
He"s right there.
Can you chill?

175
00:10:56,307 --> 00:10:58,048
We"ll figure it out.

176
00:11:04,968 --> 00:11:07,492
What was that?

177
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:20,331
Mm-mmm.Oh. Oh.

178
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:21,985
Gentlemen first, okay?

179
00:11:25,902 --> 00:11:28,557
Did you leave that open? No.

180
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,006
You"re such a scaredy-cat.

181
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,399
It"s adorable.

182
00:11:46,488 --> 00:11:47,488
Oh, gosh.

183
00:11:52,363 --> 00:11:55,105
Eli, what are you doing here?

184
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:09,729
Here. I got it.

185
00:12:15,386 --> 00:12:18,476
Uh, may I? Oh, no, it"s okay.
Thank you.

186
00:12:21,697 --> 00:12:22,785
Oh, hi, puppy.

187
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:27,224
Sorry.

188
00:12:27,398 --> 00:12:28,486
This way.

189
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:39,802
All right, I"m this way.
So you guys sleep tight.

190
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:42,109
I"ll be, uh, in there.

191
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:44,285
See you in the morning. Good night.

192
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:47,288
Your room is over here. What the fuck?

193
00:12:52,946 --> 00:12:53,947
Wow.

194
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,732
Oh, it"s beautiful.

195
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:59,039
There"s more wood by the stove.

196
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:01,084
If you need anything,
let me know.Okay.

197
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:03,391
Good night. It"s perfect.
Thank you so much.

198
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:07,787
Hey, Jacob, actually, um...

199
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:12,008
Thank you.
That means so much. Good night.

200
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:20,800
Okay.
So, what"d he say?

201
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:25,979
He said, "Thank you so much
for bringing Eli home,"

202
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:30,070
and he"s really grateful, so we
can stay for a couple of days.

203
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:32,376
With our cameras? He said, "Okay."

204
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,465
Hey! Yes!

205
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,904
It"s so weird, like, I was so...

206
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,865
I mean, it was the first people I"ve
ever seen who are related to me.

207
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,738
Yeah, that"s your family. I was wondering
if we"d look alike.

208
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:49,916
Dale, you don"t fit on the bed.

209
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,874
Oh, yeah.

210
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:54,572
I"m used to it.
I sleep on a full at home.

211
00:13:54,746 --> 00:13:57,749
Why do you sleep on a full?
You"re, like, 6"7".

212
00:13:57,924 --> 00:14:00,448
I share a room with my mom,
and she takes the queen.

213
00:14:00,622 --> 00:14:02,842
You sleep with your mom? Yeah, yeah.

214
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:04,452
She lives with me, so...

215
00:14:04,626 --> 00:14:05,757
I don"t... Yeah.

216
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:08,978
What? That"s sweet.

217
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,157
Chris?

218
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:15,854
Chris? What?

219
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:16,943
Look.

220
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,295
What"s up?

221
00:14:29,172 --> 00:14:32,741
What the hell?
It"s, like, 00 in the morning.

222
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:34,395
Are those people?

223
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:41,881
Yeah, I hope so.

224
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:43,839
I mean, what else could it be?

225
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:46,276
It "s like they" re going
into the forest.

226
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:55,590
What the fuck?

227
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:01,857
That was weird.

228
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:19,831
I got some cool B-roll
this morning.

229
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:24,140
Froot Loops.

230
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:26,534
Did you know that they
could eat Froot Loops?

231
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,319
It"s cereal, dude,
not a computer.

232
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:32,018
You don"t have to do this.

233
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:35,586
I love your dress. It"s so pretty.
Did you make that?

234
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,067
No. It"s from Walmart.

235
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:40,026
Do you have TikTok?

236
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,507
Uh, no, not on my phone. I do.
I gotta show you this video I made.

237
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:46,206
Mary, stop ruching around.

238
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:52,429
Sorry, Levina.
Sorry, sorry.

239
00:15:52,603 --> 00:15:53,691
Good morning.
Good morning.

240
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,608
Sorry. Just trying to
give you some local flair.

241
00:15:57,782 --> 00:15:58,914
It means, "How are you?"

242
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,134
Hi! Hi, Eli.

243
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:02,352
What"s up, dude?

244
00:16:02,526 --> 00:16:03,963
Um...

245
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:06,313
Hey, Eli. Eli.

246
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:11,361
So do you all have any plans
for the day, or...

247
00:16:12,797 --> 00:16:16,279
Um, we would love to see
the rest of your home.

248
00:16:16,453 --> 00:16:18,238
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

249
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:21,676
I know the elders like Jacob
can feel kind of intense,

250
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,852
but as long as you stick
with me, you"ll be fine.

251
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:26,570
Don"t approach anybody in the community
without asking their permission.

252
00:16:26,594 --> 00:16:29,901
Everybody"s really nice,
but they can be a little shy.

253
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:34,254
Um... Oh, the woods, I would avoid those.
We get bears.

254
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:38,171
And I"ll be with you, but they get
kind of violent during the winter.

255
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:41,696
Actually, we saw some people going
into the woods last night, super late.

256
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,351
Yeah, that was
probably a hunting party.

257
00:16:44,525 --> 00:16:47,267
Somebody"s cow
got attacked, so...

258
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:49,312
Oh. Okay.Yeah.

259
00:16:52,098 --> 00:16:54,187
I feel like everyone
seems relatively young.

260
00:16:55,797 --> 00:16:58,104
So how long
has the family been here?

261
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:01,846
A long time.
About 200 years, I think.

262
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:04,632
200 years? Yeah.

263
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:06,590
Watch the fire here.

264
00:17:06,764 --> 00:17:08,636
So this is the workshop.

265
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:13,032
Fix horseshoes,
equipment, wheels.Wow.

266
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:15,469
Work "em young.

267
00:17:15,643 --> 00:17:17,775
Yeah, everyone has a purpose.

268
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:20,039
He"s not used to strangers.
Come on.

269
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:25,087
Where did my mom live
when she was here?

270
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:28,308
I think she was in the room above yours,
but we just use it as storage now.

271
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:29,657
Oh.

272
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:32,225
You wanna see the barn? Yeah.

273
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:36,185
Oh, my gosh,
there"s so many cows.

274
00:17:38,622 --> 00:17:41,060
What "s all the bags? Uh, it"s salt.

275
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:43,018
You know, for the animals
and ice.

276
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:47,240
Are those pigs? Stop. Also got some pigs.

277
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:50,069
Come on.

278
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:51,679
There"s pigs. Okay, come on over.

279
00:17:51,853 --> 00:17:53,420
Guys, get in.

280
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:55,465
They really like... Dale, get in.

281
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:57,206
No, you don"t have to
get the shot.

282
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,643
Just, you have to
experience the pigs, okay?

283
00:17:59,817 --> 00:18:02,559
You could put your
boom mic... Yeah.

284
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:04,692
Yeah, g-get his dialogue.

285
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:06,607
Stop. Hey, what"s the scoop?

286
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:10,132
Sir, what"s the scoop? I gotta get a shot
of these guys too.

287
00:18:10,306 --> 00:18:12,482
It"s too cute. Do they all have...

288
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:15,181
How do I say this?
Like, nice butts like that?

289
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,099
You guys wanna see the loft?
Yes.

290
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,191
Oh, hey. Oh, my God, Sam.

291
00:18:25,365 --> 00:18:27,497
It"s pretty cool,
right? It"s huge.

292
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:30,500
Well, we got a lot of animals to
feed, especially during the winter.

293
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:32,894
It"s beautiful.
You"re gonna do my job too?

294
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:35,308
You"re in the center of my frame.
That"s what we"re doing?

295
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:38,900
Shit, man.Okay.

296
00:18:39,074 --> 00:18:40,728
Sorry. You okay?

297
00:18:40,902 --> 00:18:42,730
Yeah. I"m so sorry.
There"s a bale drop there.

298
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:45,167
You gotta be careful. That wouldn"t have
been too good.

299
00:18:45,341 --> 00:18:46,821
Shish kebab, you know?

300
00:18:46,995 --> 00:18:48,736
I wasn"t paying
any attention. It"s okay.

301
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,781
There"s lots of holes
around here.

302
00:18:50,955 --> 00:18:53,175
Let "s get you away from that. I"m a klutz.
Thank you.

303
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:55,090
You good? Yeah, I"m fine.

304
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:57,310
Let"s get down
from this height. Is there a restroom?

305
00:18:57,484 --> 00:18:59,442
I kind of peed a little
when she...

306
00:19:07,842 --> 00:19:09,496
Hey. Hi.Hi.

307
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,585
I"m Margot.

308
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,693
I don"t think I"ve met you
guys yet, but, yeah, we"ve met.

309
00:19:13,717 --> 00:19:15,110
That"s Clara. Clara, hi.

310
00:19:15,284 --> 00:19:17,156
And Grace. A dog!

311
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,592
He"s so cute.

312
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:19,766
How old are you guys?

313
00:19:19,854 --> 00:19:21,551
I"m 16.Sixteen?

314
00:19:22,422 --> 00:19:24,293
Are you... You"re all 16?

315
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:27,601
Yeah, so you guys are way too
young to have known my mom.

316
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:30,647
But your parents, do
they ever talk about her?

317
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:33,967
My mom said Sarah hooked up
with an Englishman.

318
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:35,783
Clara. Everyone knows it.

319
00:19:36,827 --> 00:19:38,264
An Englishman?

320
00:19:38,438 --> 00:19:40,309
Just means someone
outside the community.

321
00:19:41,484 --> 00:19:44,879
Oh, so, like...
like, a local?

322
00:19:46,924 --> 00:19:49,579
Um, does anybody
know who he was?

323
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,891
So she got pregnant
with an outsider?

324
00:19:57,065 --> 00:19:59,633
So I imagine that didn"t
go over very well.

325
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:01,983
We have a lot of work to do.

326
00:20:02,157 --> 00:20:05,726
We"ll get in trouble if we don"t get to it.
Right, Clara?

327
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,597
Yes, I"m sorry. Excuse us.

328
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:40,543
Amen.Amen.

329
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:46,767
We have a saying.

330
00:20:46,941 --> 00:20:51,424
"The storm may scatter a thousand
leaves, but the tree grows anew."

331
00:20:51,598 --> 00:20:56,037
We are humbled and grateful to have
our sister, Margot, returned to us.

332
00:20:56,951 --> 00:20:58,909
The Lord"s will unfolds,

333
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:03,479
and we accept the obligations and
the sacrifices that he expects of us.

334
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:06,917
Eh.

335
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:10,356
Uh, thank you so much for
allowing us into your home.

336
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,793
I am so grateful.

337
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:14,751
Seriously. Um...

338
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:17,537
I"ve always hoped
that I could meet you all,

339
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:20,844
so this is a really
special moment for me.

340
00:21:21,018 --> 00:21:23,020
So thank you.

341
00:21:23,194 --> 00:21:26,502
Dude.

342
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:28,678
I thought it was a clap moment.

343
00:21:31,115 --> 00:21:32,813
Begin.

344
00:21:32,987 --> 00:21:35,903
I"d have some, but...

345
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:41,865
Oh, right.
Right, right, right.

346
00:21:42,953 --> 00:21:44,607
They tend to the chickens.

347
00:21:44,781 --> 00:21:46,870
Hamburger.
Hamburger.

348
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,235
Jacob definitely
has a thing for you.

349
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:48,932
What? He"s always staring at you.

350
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:50,826
Don "t be gross. What"s wrong
with this thing?

351
00:22:50,891 --> 00:22:52,501
Nothing"s charging.

352
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:55,069
It"s old.
Just wiggle it. That"s what she said.

353
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:57,201
Stupid.

354
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:02,076
I actually thought it was really
sweet the way everyone was so present.

355
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,643
What, you wanna join "em?

356
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:06,123
No, but I mean,
when is the last time

357
00:23:06,297 --> 00:23:09,344
that you went to dinner
and didn"t look at your phone?

358
00:23:09,518 --> 00:23:12,391
Tonight.

359
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:13,783
Exactly.

360
00:23:17,874 --> 00:23:20,050
Dude, close it.
It"s freezing.

361
00:23:21,356 --> 00:23:23,271
I don"t hear the genny.

362
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:25,316
And it"s snowing again.

363
00:23:27,188 --> 00:23:29,799
I"d fix it,
but I"m already in my cammies.

364
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,196
It"s dark dark.

365
00:23:38,286 --> 00:23:39,505
"Cammies."

366
00:23:40,244 --> 00:23:41,768
It"s coming down.

367
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:04,790
Shit.

368
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,799
Oh, shit!

369
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:17,194
Bitch-ass scarecrow.

370
00:24:20,284 --> 00:24:22,330
Ain"t even no crows out here.

371
00:24:31,078 --> 00:24:32,296
Fuck.

372
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:46,354
Come on, baby,
don"t do this to me now.

373
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:10,726
Oh, Jesus.

374
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,119
Kid, you scared me.

375
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:20,388
Sleepwalker.

376
00:25:21,476 --> 00:25:23,130
He does it from time to time.

377
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:25,654
Lucky you were out here.

378
00:25:25,828 --> 00:25:27,177
Yeah.
Our generator died.

379
00:25:27,351 --> 00:25:30,311
Come back inside.
The cold will bite you.

380
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:33,923
Weird.

381
00:25:38,058 --> 00:25:39,712
My head is killing me.

382
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:44,368
What"s up with that? Barometric pressure.

383
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:48,895
It"s like altitude sickness, only
your body"s reacting to the clean air.

384
00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:52,376
Dale, you are an encyclopedia
of random information.

385
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,682
Thank you.

386
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:00,602
Did you hear that sound again last
night, like someone walking in the attic?

387
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:03,039
No, I was knocked out.Same.

388
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:15,399
Dale, you"re completely insane.

389
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,664
Come on.
The makeover maketh the man.

390
00:26:18,838 --> 00:26:20,491
That"s what she said, right? Yeah.

391
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:22,755
Yeah.

392
00:26:29,413 --> 00:26:31,677
Yes, Dale!

393
00:26:31,851 --> 00:26:34,897
Hee-hee! Oh?

394
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:36,333
What do we think?

395
00:26:36,507 --> 00:26:38,597
You guys know that dance?
A little moonwalk.

396
00:26:38,771 --> 00:26:40,990
Yeah, do the dance.
Come on, everybody!

397
00:26:41,164 --> 00:26:42,513
Everybody, dance with me.

398
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:45,212
Hello, hello.

399
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,345
Suits you.

400
00:26:54,308 --> 00:26:57,354
Let "s go talk to " em.Yeah.

401
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:09,149
See, that"s slow motion. It"s getting
a whole bunch of frames for one second.

402
00:27:09,323 --> 00:27:11,368
A thousand pictures, one second.

403
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:15,024
So it gets, like, the little
details, intricacies of you.

404
00:27:15,198 --> 00:27:18,637
The water splashing up right there.
Stuff the human eye can"t see.

405
00:27:18,811 --> 00:27:19,812
Mmm.

406
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:26,862
I like your doll.

407
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:32,651
What"s her name? Sarah.

408
00:27:36,524 --> 00:27:38,395
That"s a pretty name.Thanks.

409
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:43,487
You know,
that was my mom"s name.

410
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,576
She used to live here
a long time ago.

411
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:47,491
She"s still here.

412
00:27:49,624 --> 00:27:52,714
What did you say? She doesn"t like you.

413
00:27:53,976 --> 00:27:55,761
Who doesn"t like me?

414
00:27:57,284 --> 00:27:58,415
Wait, y...

415
00:28:00,287 --> 00:28:03,116
She just left her doll
like that?

416
00:28:17,173 --> 00:28:18,784
What is that?

417
00:28:37,933 --> 00:28:42,024
It"s00 in the morning,
and somebody"s up there again.

418
00:28:42,198 --> 00:28:44,287
Third night in a row.

419
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,033
Oh, fuck.

420
00:28:51,947 --> 00:28:52,948
Door"s open.

421
00:29:14,665 --> 00:29:15,884
Oh, fuck.

422
00:29:50,614 --> 00:29:52,051
Creepy.

423
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:16,483
What the fuck?

424
00:31:32,368 --> 00:31:33,848
What?

425
00:31:53,172 --> 00:31:55,000
No fucking way.

426
00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:31,514
What is that?

427
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:03,198
Hello?

428
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,426
Hello?

429
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:09,237
You gotta be kidding me.

430
00:35:09,411 --> 00:35:10,673
Fuck.

431
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:14,199
How do I get out of here?

432
00:35:18,594 --> 00:35:19,943
Okay.

433
00:35:29,518 --> 00:35:31,041
Fuck.

434
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:36,134
God.

435
00:35:44,533 --> 00:35:46,361
This is gonna be interesting.

436
00:35:57,938 --> 00:36:00,027
What was it?
I don"t know.

437
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:02,725
I mean, it looks
like a face, right?

438
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:04,858
It"s gotta be something else.

439
00:36:05,032 --> 00:36:07,730
I mean, a lens distortion.

440
00:36:07,904 --> 00:36:10,168
A lens distortion? Mmm.

441
00:36:10,342 --> 00:36:14,172
Fucking... See, this is... No.

442
00:36:14,346 --> 00:36:17,392
This is why I don"t like creepy old farms.
They"re always haunted.

443
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:19,568
Dale, keep your voice down.

444
00:36:19,742 --> 00:36:22,397
I"m serious. Look at this place.
Tell me it"s not fucking haunted.

445
00:36:22,571 --> 00:36:24,443
Really.

446
00:36:24,617 --> 00:36:28,011
My cousin Greg saw a ghost in the
walk-in freezer at a Cracker Barrel.

447
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,971
What was he going in
the walk-in freezer for?

448
00:36:31,145 --> 00:36:33,887
He worked there.
Okay.

449
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:39,153
Are you really buying this shit?

450
00:36:39,327 --> 00:36:42,200
I mean, I felt
something up there with me.

451
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:45,551
Okay.

452
00:36:45,725 --> 00:36:48,902
So, we"re ghost hunters now.
Is that it?

453
00:36:49,076 --> 00:36:51,339
"Cause I thought I signed up
for a prestige documentary,

454
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:53,385
not a fringy
ghost-farm cable show.

455
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:55,474
It"s not funny, Chris.
It"s not.

456
00:36:55,648 --> 00:37:00,522
I mean, like, the letter,
the creepy drawing.

457
00:37:00,696 --> 00:37:04,265
And then the little girl saying,
"She"s still here."

458
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:07,094
I mean, something is going on,

459
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:11,141
and it feels like it has
something to do with my mom.

460
00:37:11,316 --> 00:37:14,275
Yeah, right over there.
That"d be great.

461
00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:18,236
You"re set. Sorry, just making sure that...
Doesn"t matter if you can see it, right?

462
00:37:19,715 --> 00:37:21,239
Dale, two steps back.

463
00:37:22,414 --> 00:37:23,414
Looks good.

464
00:37:23,502 --> 00:37:25,895
Do I just start?

465
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:28,289
Yeah, when you"re ready.Mmm.

466
00:37:32,511 --> 00:37:34,469
Sarah was, um...

467
00:37:36,515 --> 00:37:38,517
Sarah was our wildflower.

468
00:37:40,606 --> 00:37:42,129
A nonconformist

469
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:46,655
growing up in a community
whose bedrock is homogeneity.

470
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:48,266
And, uh...

471
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:51,617
Uh...

472
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:53,183
But the, uh...

473
00:37:55,055 --> 00:37:57,492
I mean, what...

474
00:37:57,666 --> 00:38:01,844
What we all saw as spunky
and free-spirited

475
00:38:02,018 --> 00:38:04,194
when she was
a little girl, um...

476
00:38:07,197 --> 00:38:11,637
I-it evolved into
something much darker.

477
00:38:13,595 --> 00:38:15,771
There were several attempts
to take her own life.

478
00:38:15,945 --> 00:38:17,295
What?

479
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:20,820
When that didn"t work,
she got pregnant.

480
00:38:20,994 --> 00:38:25,259
It was... It was a boy from town.
She wouldn"t tell us who.

481
00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:29,350
I...

482
00:38:31,265 --> 00:38:35,225
I suspect she did it
purely out of spite,

483
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:40,535
as a way to...
To rail against our ways

484
00:38:40,709 --> 00:38:41,971
and our rules.

485
00:38:42,145 --> 00:38:44,844
And, uh, that worked.

486
00:38:45,801 --> 00:38:47,586
She was shunned.

487
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,109
Shunned.

488
00:38:50,806 --> 00:38:52,591
What, like, sent away?

489
00:38:52,765 --> 00:38:54,680
No, no.

490
00:38:54,854 --> 00:38:58,292
Shunning is being separated
from the flock.

491
00:38:59,728 --> 00:39:04,211
You eat alone, you work alone,
you sleep alone.

492
00:39:05,604 --> 00:39:08,824
And that"s...
And that is painful, trust me.

493
00:39:13,438 --> 00:39:16,876
I suppose it could be
what drove her away in the end.

494
00:39:24,144 --> 00:39:26,929
I found this letter
in my mom"s room.

495
00:39:38,288 --> 00:39:40,247
You were in the attic
last night.

496
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:43,119
What did she mean when she said,

497
00:39:43,293 --> 00:39:45,339
"You can"t have me or my baby"?

498
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:54,740
We don"t allow children
out of wedlock.

499
00:39:54,914 --> 00:39:59,222
Sarah was required to give her baby to
another wedded couple in the community.

500
00:40:02,051 --> 00:40:05,185
She was forced
to give me away? That"s right.

501
00:40:10,364 --> 00:40:11,844
That"s horrible.

502
00:40:12,018 --> 00:40:16,109
More horrible than leaving
a newborn on the ground,

503
00:40:16,283 --> 00:40:18,633
on the sidewalk
like a piece of trash?

504
00:40:19,982 --> 00:40:21,723
I loved Sarah.

505
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:24,900
She was my only daughter, but
she cared for nobody but herself.

506
00:40:27,033 --> 00:40:28,513
That was her sickness.

507
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:33,692
I get it.

508
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:36,825
It"s shitty
what they did to her.

509
00:40:38,131 --> 00:40:39,349
Yeah.

510
00:40:49,229 --> 00:40:52,406
But I mean, she did the
right thing though, right?

511
00:40:54,887 --> 00:40:57,411
"Cause otherwise I would
have been stuck here forever.

512
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:00,501
For sure.

513
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,858
I ke...

514
00:41:10,032 --> 00:41:11,991
I keep thinking
about that little girl.

515
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,995
What she said the other day.

516
00:41:23,176 --> 00:41:24,743
I have this...

517
00:41:26,353 --> 00:41:28,660
weird feeling she"s still here,

518
00:41:28,834 --> 00:41:32,359
in the pit of my stomach,
ever since I got here.

519
00:41:33,752 --> 00:41:35,841
I can"t put my finger on it.

520
00:42:24,759 --> 00:42:26,152
All right, not much further.

521
00:42:26,326 --> 00:42:28,720
The drone made it seem
like it was right over here.

522
00:42:28,894 --> 00:42:33,681
I think I would do, like,
a spaghetti with meatballs right now.

523
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,596
Are you that hungry?

524
00:42:36,684 --> 00:42:38,251
Would you guys eat human?

525
00:42:38,425 --> 00:42:40,514
No, I would never eat a human.

526
00:42:40,688 --> 00:42:44,692
I would eat a person faster than
I"d like to admit, to be honest.

527
00:42:44,866 --> 00:42:46,694
Well, that"s noted.

528
00:42:46,868 --> 00:42:49,436
Look up though.
Look at that.

529
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,785
Nyeh-nyeh-nyeh!

530
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:54,876
How far away
are we supposed to go?

531
00:42:56,878 --> 00:42:58,663
Whoa.

532
00:42:58,837 --> 00:43:02,101
Right? That "s what I" ve
been telling you about.

533
00:43:02,275 --> 00:43:04,277
So it"s a church.
Whoopee.

534
00:43:04,451 --> 00:43:08,020
Yeah, but why would they build
a church all the way back here?

535
00:43:08,194 --> 00:43:09,761
It"s like a mile away.

536
00:43:09,935 --> 00:43:12,024
Gotta be where they were going
the other night.

537
00:43:12,198 --> 00:43:14,766
Bears, my ass.

538
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,986
That means a lot of people
walking through here.

539
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,336
Be careful. Watch your step.

540
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:21,729
Yeah.

541
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:28,344
"So weit nicht weiter."

542
00:43:29,389 --> 00:43:30,738
Anyone speak German?

543
00:43:30,912 --> 00:43:32,740
Yeah, it says, um,

544
00:43:32,914 --> 00:43:34,873
"Sweet, nice wiener."

545
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:39,312
Man.

546
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,361
Can you pick a lock? Of course. I"m Black.

547
00:43:48,321 --> 00:43:50,192
Move aside, please.

548
00:43:51,716 --> 00:43:53,456
No way.

549
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:57,112
Yeah, cousin Greg used to
boost stuff all the time.

550
00:43:57,286 --> 00:43:59,288
You know, TVs,
cars, whatever.Sorry.

551
00:43:59,462 --> 00:44:00,638
Cousin Greg"s busy.

552
00:44:00,812 --> 00:44:03,423
Cousin Greg is in prison.

553
00:44:03,597 --> 00:44:04,903
Voilà.

554
00:44:07,427 --> 00:44:09,472
No, no, stop!

555
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,606
This is a house of worship. It"s
off limits to you. No cameras!

556
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,608
Sorry. Yeah.

557
00:44:14,782 --> 00:44:17,002
Can we go inside
without the cameras? No, I"m sorry.

558
00:44:17,176 --> 00:44:18,612
It"s not permitted.

559
00:44:20,222 --> 00:44:23,008
Lunch is ready back at the house.
Come with me.

560
00:44:23,182 --> 00:44:25,793
Yes. Thanks.

561
00:44:25,967 --> 00:44:29,623
What are we doing? Like a
schnitzel thing, or a sausage?

562
00:44:29,797 --> 00:44:33,018
Is that offensive? I don"t
know if that"s stereotyping.

563
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:42,549
Not for me, not for me.

564
00:44:42,723 --> 00:44:45,378
Thank you so much.

565
00:44:45,552 --> 00:44:47,902
There seems to be a little more.

566
00:44:48,076 --> 00:44:50,296
Dale, save some
for everyone else.

567
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:52,646
Oh, yeah, sorry.

568
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,169
Dude.

569
00:45:13,928 --> 00:45:16,888
Hey, mind if I film you
for a moment?

570
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,768
Fuck.

571
00:45:27,942 --> 00:45:29,204
Hey. Hey.
Oh, my gosh.

572
00:45:29,378 --> 00:45:31,380
Fetch me the first-aid kit.

573
00:46:03,238 --> 00:46:04,892
What is that?

574
00:46:08,113 --> 00:46:10,506
No way.

575
00:46:33,268 --> 00:46:35,009
Shh-shh-shh.

576
00:46:35,183 --> 00:46:37,055
What"s wrong? Shh. Listen.

577
00:46:37,229 --> 00:46:38,404
What?

578
00:46:41,711 --> 00:46:43,017
What is that?

579
00:46:44,584 --> 00:46:45,977
I don"t know.

580
00:46:51,634 --> 00:46:52,940
What is that?

581
00:46:56,117 --> 00:46:57,858
Turn the light off.

582
00:46:58,032 --> 00:47:00,382
They"re gonna see it.
Turn it off. Okay, right.

583
00:47:13,787 --> 00:47:15,136
What?

584
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:36,766
Hey, let"s just go back.

585
00:47:37,898 --> 00:47:41,162
Or get closer.

586
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:51,869
I can"t see shit.

587
00:47:52,826 --> 00:47:54,219
Go upstairs.

588
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:11,236
What are they doing?

589
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:12,759
What?

590
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:22,334
What? No.

591
00:48:30,733 --> 00:48:32,300
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

592
00:48:42,484 --> 00:48:44,269
It"s starting to spread.

593
00:48:44,443 --> 00:48:46,053
I know, sister.

594
00:48:46,227 --> 00:48:49,100
First the children,
and then the old.

595
00:48:49,274 --> 00:48:52,190
We have to do it now.

596
00:48:52,364 --> 00:48:54,496
What is she talking about?

597
00:48:57,325 --> 00:48:58,761
We should follow them.

598
00:49:21,219 --> 00:49:22,437
Fuck.

599
00:49:29,836 --> 00:49:31,272
What are they doing?

600
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:34,232
Something fucked up.

601
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:47,897
Why would they put it
in a church? Definitely not to bless it.

602
00:49:53,164 --> 00:49:57,820
We hear this insane screaming, dying
noise in the middle of the night,

603
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:01,085
and then we go and there"s,
like, a goat sacrifice.

604
00:50:01,259 --> 00:50:03,261
Look, animals get sick, right?

605
00:50:04,131 --> 00:50:05,915
Some have birth defects.

606
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:08,450
We can"t feed them, take care of them.
We do what we have to.

607
00:50:08,483 --> 00:50:11,225
Okay, then why did they bring
the goats into your church?

608
00:50:11,399 --> 00:50:13,619
I told you
not to go in the church.

609
00:50:13,793 --> 00:50:16,578
We didn"t go in the church,
we saw them... Hey, what"s going on here?

610
00:50:16,752 --> 00:50:18,754
What do you mean?

611
00:50:18,928 --> 00:50:21,081
Thought this was supposed to be a
documentary about where you"re from.

612
00:50:21,105 --> 00:50:23,237
And now you"re
sneaking out at night,

613
00:50:23,411 --> 00:50:27,372
and you"re filming all kinds of stuff
that"s not really your business.

614
00:50:27,546 --> 00:50:30,766
I"m trying to help you.
Don"t make me regret it.

615
00:50:35,249 --> 00:50:36,859
I don"t know
what happened to my mom,

616
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:39,471
but I feel like the answers
are in that church.

617
00:50:39,645 --> 00:50:42,474
Well, they obviously
left Sam behind to babysit us.

618
00:50:43,866 --> 00:50:46,739
So we"ll have to find a way
to distract him.

619
00:50:48,306 --> 00:50:50,221
All right, who"s first?

620
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,223
You got it.

621
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,790
Let"s go, Dale.

622
00:50:54,964 --> 00:50:56,879
Okay.

623
00:50:57,054 --> 00:51:00,144
So you"re gonna take both of these
reins in your left hand. Good.

624
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:02,363
Right hand"s gonna
go around that pommel.

625
00:51:02,537 --> 00:51:04,626
Your left foot"s
gonna go in the stirrup.

626
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,280
And then...

627
00:51:06,454 --> 00:51:07,455
Hold that tight.

628
00:51:07,629 --> 00:51:08,717
Whoa!

629
00:51:08,891 --> 00:51:10,502
You"re okay. Hey! Look at you.

630
00:51:10,676 --> 00:51:13,809
I told you he likes you.
Both hands on the reins.

631
00:51:13,983 --> 00:51:15,855
Good, good.
Both hands, both hands.

632
00:51:16,029 --> 00:51:17,596
Okay.
You "re okay, you" re okay.

633
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:19,076
Have fun.

634
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:20,729
No, no, no. Hey!

635
00:51:20,903 --> 00:51:22,166
Oh!

636
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:24,342
Hey, stop!
You wrong for that.

637
00:51:24,516 --> 00:51:27,258
Just pull back
on the reins! Go, Dale.

638
00:51:27,432 --> 00:51:29,086
I"m squeezing!

639
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:32,132
Stop! Tell him to stop!

640
00:51:43,926 --> 00:51:45,319
All right.

641
00:51:49,671 --> 00:51:50,716
Voilà.

642
00:52:03,076 --> 00:52:04,164
What?

643
00:52:06,384 --> 00:52:08,125
Where are the pews?

644
00:52:08,299 --> 00:52:10,344
I thought this
was supposed to be a church.

645
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:16,002
Chris.

646
00:52:17,221 --> 00:52:19,092
There"s paintings on the ground.

647
00:52:19,266 --> 00:52:20,702
Oh, yeah.

648
00:52:20,876 --> 00:52:24,141
Kind of looks like a drawing
that I saw in the attic.

649
00:52:24,315 --> 00:52:26,534
"Asmodeus."

650
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,240
Shit.

651
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,245
What the fuck, man?

652
00:52:47,512 --> 00:52:50,384
"The young and the weak
will suffer first"?

653
00:52:55,302 --> 00:52:57,522
"Lest sacrifices be made."

654
00:52:58,262 --> 00:53:00,002
Okay.

655
00:53:03,745 --> 00:53:04,920
What is that?

656
00:53:09,055 --> 00:53:10,448
Okay...

657
00:53:13,059 --> 00:53:16,715
Is that some, like,
Cirque du Soleil stuff?

658
00:53:26,594 --> 00:53:28,379
Saw those in the barn.

659
00:53:31,164 --> 00:53:32,687
That"s a big bell.

660
00:53:34,254 --> 00:53:35,690
Yo, Margot.

661
00:53:36,343 --> 00:53:37,518
Margot? Here.

662
00:53:37,692 --> 00:53:38,824
Oh.

663
00:53:38,998 --> 00:53:40,217
Look.

664
00:53:41,479 --> 00:53:43,481
What is that? I think it"s blood.

665
00:53:50,705 --> 00:53:52,577
Okay, hold on one second.

666
00:53:52,751 --> 00:53:54,187
Just one second.

667
00:53:56,015 --> 00:53:57,234
What?

668
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,248
This thing slides. Don"t break it.

669
00:54:11,422 --> 00:54:13,554
Help me push it over. Why?

670
00:54:13,728 --> 00:54:15,948
One, two...

671
00:54:18,733 --> 00:54:19,908
That"s it.

672
00:54:21,214 --> 00:54:22,389
No way.

673
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:30,005
Fuck.

674
00:54:31,398 --> 00:54:32,617
Holy fuck.

675
00:54:33,444 --> 00:54:34,706
Holy fuck.

676
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,237
Whoa. Okay, so what?

677
00:54:44,411 --> 00:54:45,456
They just...

678
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,460
threw the dead goats down there?

679
00:54:49,634 --> 00:54:50,939
But why?

680
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,116
I don"t know, some sort of...

681
00:54:55,422 --> 00:54:56,945
religious custom?

682
00:54:57,990 --> 00:54:59,121
Fuck.

683
00:55:00,427 --> 00:55:02,211
Hey, hey, be careful.

684
00:55:13,179 --> 00:55:15,703
Whoa, dude, that"s...

685
00:55:15,877 --> 00:55:17,444
That"s fucking far, yo.

686
00:55:23,189 --> 00:55:24,277
What?

687
00:55:25,974 --> 00:55:28,194
Fuck it. Fuck what?

688
00:55:28,368 --> 00:55:29,674
Fuck what?

689
00:55:29,848 --> 00:55:31,632
What? Mm-mmm!

690
00:55:31,806 --> 00:55:34,331
Hard no this time. We don"t
even know if this thing is safe.

691
00:55:34,505 --> 00:55:37,246
It"s here. I mean, they"re
using it for a reason.

692
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:40,989
Okay, Margot, I can"t just stand here
and let you do this. Come on, now.

693
00:55:41,163 --> 00:55:44,166
Chris, we get one shot, one chance.
I"m not messing it up.

694
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,951
It"s too important.

695
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:48,257
Just give me the camera.
Man the pulley. We got this.

696
00:55:48,432 --> 00:55:50,390
The fuck we got this.

697
00:55:53,828 --> 00:55:55,395
You sure about this?

698
00:55:55,569 --> 00:55:56,918
Yes.

699
00:55:57,092 --> 00:55:58,355
It"s good.

700
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,146
Do I look cool?

701
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,756
No, you look crazy.

702
00:56:10,976 --> 00:56:12,281
Don"t move.

703
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,022
Thank you.

704
00:56:17,939 --> 00:56:19,201
Okay.

705
00:56:21,987 --> 00:56:25,643
Okay, just...
let it out real slow.

706
00:56:25,817 --> 00:56:27,384
Slow.

707
00:56:30,299 --> 00:56:31,344
Okay.

708
00:56:34,086 --> 00:56:35,435
Are you okay? Yeah.

709
00:56:36,305 --> 00:56:37,916
Yeah, I"m good. Keep going.

710
00:56:52,147 --> 00:56:53,147
You good?

711
00:56:53,279 --> 00:56:54,323
Yep.

712
00:56:55,673 --> 00:56:57,022
What am I doing?

713
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:06,727
Jesus, what is that?

714
00:57:07,467 --> 00:57:08,512
What?

715
00:57:10,601 --> 00:57:11,819
There"s a smell.

716
00:57:11,993 --> 00:57:13,125
Fuck.

717
00:57:13,995 --> 00:57:15,257
It"s pretty bad.

718
00:57:18,609 --> 00:57:19,740
You okay?

719
00:57:20,524 --> 00:57:21,612
Yeah.

720
00:57:21,786 --> 00:57:22,917
I-I"m good.

721
00:57:32,144 --> 00:57:33,711
What the fuck? What?

722
00:57:41,501 --> 00:57:43,416
There"s crosses everywhere.

723
00:57:44,156 --> 00:57:45,156
What?

724
00:57:45,244 --> 00:57:46,898
There"s crosses everywhere.

725
00:57:48,334 --> 00:57:50,249
Do you wanna keep going?

726
00:57:51,293 --> 00:57:52,991
Yeah.

727
00:57:53,165 --> 00:57:54,819
Yeah, keep going.

728
00:58:05,394 --> 00:58:06,918
Ohh.

729
00:58:15,666 --> 00:58:16,710
Okay.

730
00:58:19,626 --> 00:58:21,323
I can see the bottom!

731
00:58:28,983 --> 00:58:31,420
Chr... Chris?

732
00:58:34,293 --> 00:58:35,729
Chris?

733
00:58:37,339 --> 00:58:38,863
Hey, what"s wrong?

734
00:58:43,955 --> 00:58:45,391
It"s stuck.

735
00:58:46,871 --> 00:58:49,264
Hold on. Hold on.
Something"s stuck.

736
00:58:55,706 --> 00:58:57,359
So fucking close.

737
00:58:59,361 --> 00:59:02,539
I think I can reach it
if I lean.

738
00:59:05,716 --> 00:59:08,936
H... Hey, there"s something
down here!

739
00:59:11,112 --> 00:59:12,287
A room!

740
00:59:17,902 --> 00:59:18,990
Right.

741
00:59:36,094 --> 00:59:39,010
Okay.
Who was that?

742
00:59:40,315 --> 00:59:41,490
Wait, go back.

743
00:59:42,535 --> 00:59:44,015
Go back.

744
00:59:45,016 --> 00:59:46,931
Who is it? Who...

745
00:59:48,367 --> 00:59:50,587
Hey, Chris, I"m done.
Pull me up.

746
00:59:53,764 --> 00:59:56,375
Hey, please. I"m serious.
Pull me up.

747
01:00:00,161 --> 01:00:01,467
Chris?

748
01:00:02,163 --> 01:00:03,774
Hey, pull me up!

749
01:00:12,173 --> 01:00:14,523
Look, if you just listen to it,
then you"ll understand.

750
01:00:14,698 --> 01:00:17,048
You could"ve hurt yourself.
You scared the shit out of me.

751
01:00:17,222 --> 01:00:18,963
That "s all I"m saying.

752
01:00:19,137 --> 01:00:21,748
It"s gotta be known,
like, acknowledged at least.

753
01:00:21,922 --> 01:00:23,968
I"ll listen to it,
but it"s like... Okay.

754
01:00:24,142 --> 01:00:25,404
Come on.

755
01:00:26,448 --> 01:00:27,841
I"m listening to it.

756
01:00:29,713 --> 01:00:31,758
Dale, is that booze?

757
01:00:31,932 --> 01:00:34,456
Whiskey, man. I just
fell off a fucking horse.

758
01:00:36,067 --> 01:00:38,330
Chris.

759
01:00:38,504 --> 01:00:39,592
Chris! Okay.

760
01:00:39,766 --> 01:00:41,986
Pull me up!

761
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,378
Chris, pull me up!

762
01:00:43,552 --> 01:00:45,163
Pull me up! Go back.

763
01:00:52,257 --> 01:00:54,041
You hear that?

764
01:00:54,215 --> 01:00:55,695
There"s something down there.

765
01:00:57,915 --> 01:00:59,133
An animal?

766
01:01:01,005 --> 01:01:03,660
Shit, they"re throwing goats
down a mine shaft

767
01:01:03,834 --> 01:01:06,097
to feed an animal...

768
01:01:06,271 --> 01:01:08,534
in a cave a hundred
feet underground?

769
01:01:10,014 --> 01:01:11,711
Fuck those guys.

770
01:01:36,823 --> 01:01:39,173
Um, Jacob?

771
01:03:10,656 --> 01:03:11,744
What?

772
01:03:29,153 --> 01:03:30,241
Fuck.

773
01:03:31,546 --> 01:03:32,634
What?

774
01:03:48,302 --> 01:03:49,434
Whoa, whoa.

775
01:03:49,608 --> 01:03:51,349
Battery? Totally fucking dead.

776
01:03:51,523 --> 01:03:54,134
They"ve been watching me. What?

777
01:03:54,308 --> 01:03:57,877
Sam didn"t leave the community to
find himself. He left to find me.

778
01:03:58,051 --> 01:04:02,012
This whole thing"s like a fucking setup.
Okay, just slow down. Slow down.

779
01:04:06,407 --> 01:04:07,669
Is everything all right?

780
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,846
Yeah, I"m good.

781
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:13,153
I was feeling a little under the weather
earlier, but I"m much better now.

782
01:04:15,112 --> 01:04:16,765
Good.

783
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:18,506
Thank you. It"s good to hear.

784
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:25,774
Okay, wait. I thought they
couldn"t have computers.

785
01:04:25,949 --> 01:04:28,255
Chris, the emails went back
for over a year.

786
01:04:28,429 --> 01:04:30,518
Way before Sam contacted me.

787
01:04:30,692 --> 01:04:33,086
I mean, they knew where I live.
They have my address.

788
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:34,827
They fucking
have pictures of me.

789
01:04:35,001 --> 01:04:37,351
They had my class schedule. What the fuck?

790
01:04:37,525 --> 01:04:41,355
They were watching me. They clearly
brought us here for a reason.

791
01:04:41,529 --> 01:04:43,705
Why would they do that?
I don"t fucking know.

792
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,838
I don"t fucking know,
but it"s freaking me out.

793
01:04:46,012 --> 01:04:47,971
I wanna go home.

794
01:04:48,145 --> 01:04:51,539
I wanna go.Okay. Okay, okay.
But how?

795
01:04:51,713 --> 01:04:54,629
We have no car,
we have no phone,

796
01:04:54,803 --> 01:04:56,805
and there"s no one around
for 30 miles.

797
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:58,590
Fuck.

798
01:04:58,764 --> 01:05:00,331
This is so fucked.

799
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:05,814
Hey.

800
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,078
Tomorrow.

801
01:05:08,252 --> 01:05:10,471
Okay? It"s all good.

802
01:05:10,645 --> 01:05:13,725
First thing in the morning, we"ll head
into town and get a battery for the van.

803
01:05:17,609 --> 01:05:19,393
Okay?

804
01:05:53,601 --> 01:05:54,951
Dale, wake up.

805
01:05:58,867 --> 01:06:00,478
Wake up.

806
01:06:00,652 --> 01:06:01,958
Wake up.

807
01:06:03,872 --> 01:06:05,004
Fuck.

808
01:06:07,485 --> 01:06:08,790
Wake up.

809
01:06:13,926 --> 01:06:15,058
What?

810
01:06:25,894 --> 01:06:27,157
Chris, wake up.

811
01:06:28,114 --> 01:06:30,334
Please, wake up!

812
01:06:33,554 --> 01:06:35,556
Who the fuck is that?

813
01:07:38,315 --> 01:07:39,707
Margot?

814
01:07:43,537 --> 01:07:44,669
Chris.

815
01:07:50,327 --> 01:07:52,068
Oh, Jesus Christ.

816
01:07:52,938 --> 01:07:54,809
Hey, Margot. Margot?

817
01:07:54,983 --> 01:07:56,072
Are you okay?

818
01:08:03,905 --> 01:08:05,472
She"s resting again.

819
01:08:08,345 --> 01:08:10,521
What was wrong with her?

820
01:08:10,695 --> 01:08:14,873
I "d say it"s exhaustion coupled with
an unusually severe menstrual cycle.

821
01:08:15,047 --> 01:08:17,702
She lost a fair amount of blood,
but she"s going to be fine.

822
01:08:17,876 --> 01:08:19,834
Well, shouldn"t we
take her to a hospital?

823
01:08:20,008 --> 01:08:22,054
No, she doesn"t need a hospital.
She needs rest.

824
01:08:22,228 --> 01:08:25,536
Okay, no offense, but are
you even a real doctor?

825
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:27,538
Listen, let her get some rest.

826
01:08:27,712 --> 01:08:31,107
If her condition worsens,
we"ll get her to a hospital.

827
01:08:37,591 --> 01:08:39,680
Unusually strong
menstrual cycle?

828
01:08:40,551 --> 01:08:41,900
Do you believe that?

829
01:08:45,164 --> 01:08:47,949
Man, this is so stupid.
Nobody"s coming.

830
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,821
You got a better idea?

831
01:08:49,995 --> 01:08:52,302
I don"t see any Amish auto
part stores around here.

832
01:08:54,913 --> 01:08:56,175
Look.

833
01:08:56,349 --> 01:08:57,742
Oh! Ah!

834
01:08:57,916 --> 01:08:59,744
Thank God. Oh, fuck, man. Yes.

835
01:08:59,918 --> 01:09:01,528
Oh, thank God.

836
01:09:01,702 --> 01:09:03,313
I think it"s a mail truck.
Hey!

837
01:09:05,445 --> 01:09:07,273
Hey, man. Hey there.

838
01:09:07,447 --> 01:09:09,493
Will you give us a ride into town?
Our battery died.

839
01:09:09,667 --> 01:09:11,103
Yeah. That"s all right. Hop in?

840
01:09:11,277 --> 01:09:13,105
Come on in. Thank you.

841
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:14,324
Thank you so much.

842
01:09:14,498 --> 01:09:16,630
That"s a nice camera you got.

843
01:09:16,804 --> 01:09:18,739
Yeah, we"re shooting a
documentary up at the Beiler farm.

844
01:09:18,763 --> 01:09:21,679
Oh, yeah?
What "s y" alls documentary about?

845
01:09:21,853 --> 01:09:23,333
Amish people.

846
01:09:23,507 --> 01:09:25,291
Amish people? Yeah.

847
01:09:26,336 --> 01:09:28,729
You guys staying
at the Beiler farm?

848
01:09:28,903 --> 01:09:32,255
Yeah. Actually, we"ve been there
for about a week now filming.

849
01:09:32,429 --> 01:09:36,781
Yeah, all right. Well, you
know the Beilers ain"t Amish.

850
01:09:36,955 --> 01:09:39,523
Uh, what?
Of course they are.

851
01:09:39,697 --> 01:09:41,568
Think they are? Right.

852
01:09:41,742 --> 01:09:45,006
Hey, I"ve been working this
route for over 40 years

853
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:48,488
and I know every family
within a 50-square-mile area,

854
01:09:48,662 --> 01:09:51,404
and most of them are Amish.

855
01:09:51,578 --> 01:09:53,232
Now, they all will tell you...

856
01:09:54,277 --> 01:09:56,757
the Beilers ain"t Amish.

857
01:09:58,803 --> 01:10:00,587
Can I help you? Car battery?

858
01:10:00,761 --> 01:10:02,546
Size? 31C.

859
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,243
Let me go check for you.
Be right back.

860
01:10:04,417 --> 01:10:06,593
Fuck, man.

861
01:10:06,767 --> 01:10:10,075
Maybe we shouldn"t have left Margot, man.
Why would they pretend to be Amish?

862
01:10:10,249 --> 01:10:12,556
I don"t know. Maybe hiding
in plain sight, right?

863
01:10:12,730 --> 01:10:14,732
It "s like... I don"t know.

864
01:10:14,906 --> 01:10:18,083
They look like them, they
blend in, they"re off the grid.

865
01:10:18,257 --> 01:10:19,998
It"s kind of a genius idea.

866
01:10:20,172 --> 01:10:22,368
Why would they need to be Amish?
What"s the point in that?

867
01:10:22,392 --> 01:10:24,916
What size battery
was it again? Thirty-one C.

868
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:28,093
Yeah, I"m not seeing it here. I"m
gonna go check in the back for you.

869
01:10:28,267 --> 01:10:31,009
Hey, you mind if we use
your Internet for a second?

870
01:10:31,183 --> 01:10:32,532
Not at all.
Have at it.Cool.

871
01:10:32,706 --> 01:10:34,752
Just don"t look up
anything weird.

872
01:10:34,926 --> 01:10:36,493
Fuck, Dale.

873
01:10:36,667 --> 01:10:39,235
What do you want me to look up?
"Fake Amish people"?

874
01:10:39,409 --> 01:10:40,714
No, search "Asmodeus."

875
01:10:40,888 --> 01:10:42,194
Asmodeus? Yeah.

876
01:10:42,368 --> 01:10:44,283
That"s the name
we found at the church.

877
01:10:50,724 --> 01:10:53,249
"The demonic prince of lust,
suffering and wrath.

878
01:10:53,423 --> 01:10:57,078
Asmodeus, or Asmodaios, is the
overlord of the Nine Hells.

879
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:58,863
He is the prince of demons... "

880
01:10:59,037 --> 01:11:01,344
I fucking knew it, man. These
people are devil worshippers.

881
01:11:01,518 --> 01:11:03,259
Click that right there
at the top.

882
01:11:06,087 --> 01:11:09,743
"The Norwegian village of Beskytter
was beset by a pestilence.

883
01:11:09,917 --> 01:11:12,398
Crops and livestock perished,
neighbor turned against neighbor

884
01:11:12,572 --> 01:11:14,357
in abhorrent acts
of violence."

885
01:11:14,531 --> 01:11:16,010
The same stuff
you saw in the church.

886
01:11:16,184 --> 01:11:19,666
"It was believed to be
the work of the demon, Asmodeus.

887
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:23,714
In their desperation, the village
turned to the White Witch for help.

888
01:11:23,888 --> 01:11:26,543
It is said the witch trapped the
demon inside a chosen woman of God,

889
01:11:26,717 --> 01:11:29,981
her body a holy vessel
to ensnare the powerful entity.

890
01:11:32,244 --> 01:11:34,420
Through her bloodline,
from daughter to daughter,

891
01:11:34,594 --> 01:11:38,598
the demon, Asmodeus, be passed, lest
it be unleashed upon the world."

892
01:11:40,383 --> 01:11:41,819
Fuck, man.

893
01:11:41,993 --> 01:11:43,793
They trapped them
inside these women"s bodies?

894
01:11:43,864 --> 01:11:45,301
Okay, come on.

895
01:11:45,475 --> 01:11:48,869
Like, witches, demons?
Like, th-that"s not real.

896
01:11:49,043 --> 01:11:51,655
Even if it"s not real,
they could still...

897
01:11:51,829 --> 01:11:53,918
If they believe it,
then think about it.

898
01:11:54,092 --> 01:11:56,050
Margot"s mom runs off, right?

899
01:11:56,224 --> 01:11:59,532
And she hides her baby to keep her
away from these cultish motherfuckers,

900
01:11:59,706 --> 01:12:01,404
but they still find her somehow

901
01:12:01,578 --> 01:12:04,102
and they lure her back to do
whatever this shit is to her.

902
01:12:04,972 --> 01:12:06,147
All right, you guys.

903
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:07,975
Got the last 31C right here.

904
01:12:08,149 --> 01:12:10,500
Shit, dude.
You"re a lifesaver, man.

905
01:12:10,674 --> 01:12:11,674
All right.

906
01:12:14,068 --> 01:12:15,418
Fuck.

907
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:20,771
All right. I"m gonna go deal with
this battery. Meet me at the house.

908
01:12:20,945 --> 01:12:23,817
You sure you don"t need help? No, man.
Just get Margot and our shit.

909
01:12:23,991 --> 01:12:27,386
Let"s get the fuck
out of here.Yeah. Fuck this place.

910
01:12:32,217 --> 01:12:33,436
Hello?

911
01:12:34,045 --> 01:12:35,394
Sam?

912
01:12:35,568 --> 01:12:36,787
Jacob?

913
01:12:39,572 --> 01:12:40,965
Fuck. Mary.

914
01:12:41,139 --> 01:12:43,533
Hey, hey. Mary.
Wait, wait, wait. No.

915
01:12:43,707 --> 01:12:44,795
Mary.

916
01:12:44,969 --> 01:12:46,449
Where"s your dad?

917
01:12:47,188 --> 01:12:48,712
Mary, open up.

918
01:12:48,886 --> 01:12:50,148
Fuck.

919
01:12:52,063 --> 01:12:55,545
Margot, it is time to go.

920
01:12:55,719 --> 01:12:59,070
What the fuck? Our shit.
Where the fuck is our shit?

921
01:13:02,682 --> 01:13:05,032
Sam?

922
01:13:08,427 --> 01:13:11,299
What the fuck is going on, Sam?

923
01:13:11,474 --> 01:13:13,127
Where"s Margot?

924
01:13:14,564 --> 01:13:16,392
Sam?

925
01:13:16,566 --> 01:13:18,655
Where the fuck is Margot, man?

926
01:13:21,266 --> 01:13:24,312
Women are the most powerful
creatures on Earth.

927
01:13:24,487 --> 01:13:25,487
What?

928
01:13:25,575 --> 01:13:27,185
Givers of life.

929
01:13:28,665 --> 01:13:31,668
That is why our sisters
bear this burden.

930
01:13:33,191 --> 01:13:35,846
They"re the only ones strong
enough to hold him back.

931
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:38,457
What are you talking about, man?

932
01:13:38,631 --> 01:13:41,678
It"s time.

933
01:13:41,852 --> 01:13:43,897
Stay behind locked doors.

934
01:13:44,071 --> 01:13:46,204
Don"t come out until
the bell stops ringing.

935
01:13:46,378 --> 01:13:48,380
What? Sam.

936
01:13:48,554 --> 01:13:50,991
Dude, where are you going?
Sam!

937
01:14:31,728 --> 01:14:34,078
Margot?

938
01:14:36,602 --> 01:14:38,299
Margot?

939
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:42,956
Okay. Easy, man.

940
01:14:43,130 --> 01:14:45,698
Don"t try to stop this.
Just put the gun down.

941
01:14:45,872 --> 01:14:49,049
Her body is the only thing
that can hold the demon.

942
01:14:49,223 --> 01:14:52,357
If you set him free, he"ll
be able to possess anyone,

943
01:14:52,531 --> 01:14:54,011
jumping from body to body.

944
01:14:54,185 --> 01:14:55,905
What are you
doing to her? He"ll kill us all.

945
01:14:56,013 --> 01:14:58,885
He"ll kill
every last one of us.Wait.

946
01:15:00,017 --> 01:15:02,672
Just put the gun down, man.

947
01:15:02,846 --> 01:15:05,065
Please, man.
You don"t want to do this.

948
01:15:38,490 --> 01:15:41,798
Fuck. Oh, fuck.

949
01:16:00,251 --> 01:16:02,035
Hold on, Margot. I"m coming.

950
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,531
Oh... Oh, God.

951
01:16:25,319 --> 01:16:27,583
Margot? Fuck.

952
01:16:27,757 --> 01:16:29,149
Margot?

953
01:16:33,501 --> 01:16:34,938
Margot?

954
01:16:36,243 --> 01:16:38,724
Fuck. Okay, okay. Fuck.

955
01:16:42,641 --> 01:16:44,643
Okay.

956
01:16:48,212 --> 01:16:49,648
Oh, God.

957
01:16:52,782 --> 01:16:54,827
Margot?

958
01:16:55,001 --> 01:16:57,134
Margot!

959
01:16:59,571 --> 01:17:01,486
Margot.

960
01:17:03,357 --> 01:17:05,490
The fuck?

961
01:17:05,664 --> 01:17:09,929
What are you doing? Shit.
What are you doing to her?

962
01:17:10,103 --> 01:17:11,975
Margot, get the fuck up!

963
01:17:12,149 --> 01:17:14,978
Fuck. Margot!
Just stop it, all right.

964
01:17:15,152 --> 01:17:17,415
I said stop it.

965
01:17:19,504 --> 01:17:22,246
Margot? Margot. Margot.

966
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:24,378
Fuck. The salt. The salt.

967
01:17:24,552 --> 01:17:27,468
Please. Wake up, Margot.
Come on. It"s time to go.

968
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:29,993
Margot, get up. The salt. The salt.

969
01:17:30,167 --> 01:17:31,995
Margot, come on.
Get up! Please wake up.

970
01:17:32,169 --> 01:17:33,561
Yeah. Come on. Yeah. Yeah.

971
01:17:33,736 --> 01:17:36,129
No! No!
