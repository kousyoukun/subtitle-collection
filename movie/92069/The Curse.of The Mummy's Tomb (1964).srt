1
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,208
What time is it now, John?

2
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,907
It is exactly 10 minutes since
the last time you asked, Darling.

3
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:48,153
I'm sorry, but it's not like Father
to be so late at the digging.

4
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:51,958
These old tombs
give me the shivers.

5
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,988
Well, perhaps he's found
something of special interest.

6
00:03:56,634 --> 00:03:59,331
Yes, that canopic jar.

7
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:04,099
Darling, I meant something of real
interest, like a beautiful desert maiden.

8
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:06,831
The only maiden my father
would be likely to meet

9
00:04:06,985 --> 00:04:10,145
would be mummified, and
at least 3,000 years old.

10
00:04:10,204 --> 00:04:13,031
Yes, well I suppose that would be
too old, even for your father.

11
00:04:13,943 --> 00:04:17,165
- That's better. Can I
get you another drink?
- Please.

12
00:04:22,327 --> 00:04:25,319
- Unless you are trying to get me drunk.
- What?

13
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:28,603
No, not tonight. But I will
once we get back to Paris.

14
00:04:28,688 --> 00:04:31,838
When we get back
to Paris, I will let you.

15
00:04:32,612 --> 00:04:34,225
Do you promise that?

16
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:47,353
Annette... my dear.

17
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:02,820
No, John. Leave her.

18
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:11,882
He did that deliberately.

19
00:05:14,737 --> 00:05:16,429
I am sure you're wrong.

20
00:05:16,497 --> 00:05:19,096
It is not our way to be
disrespectful to the dead.

21
00:05:19,272 --> 00:05:20,606
I know all about your ways.

22
00:05:20,691 --> 00:05:23,702
Stealing our stores, inciting
our labor force to desert us.

23
00:05:23,774 --> 00:05:27,928
Oh yes, you were grateful at first - until
we found the tomb of Ra-Antef.

24
00:05:28,296 --> 00:05:31,275
Then you took one look inside, and
decided you wanted it for yourself,

25
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:34,772
and now you're trying to drive us away from here, aren't you?
How dare you speak such accusations?!

26
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:37,574
My government and I have given
every possible cooperation.

27
00:05:37,597 --> 00:05:39,394
- You've given us no...
- Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

28
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,570
This is no way to hallow
the memory of Professor Dubois.

29
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:47,082
We'll strike camp tomorrow.
We're returning to Cairo.

30
00:05:47,995 --> 00:05:50,697
- What's that, Sir Giles?
- But your work is not finished here yet.

31
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:54,798
For the safety of the treasures and ourselves
we'll complete our tabulations at headquarters.

32
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,664
It seems that your tactics
have worked after all, Hashmi.

33
00:05:58,811 --> 00:06:01,396
Now, we fold our tents
and run away!

34
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:04,294
You cannot run away from
the curse of the mummy's tomb!

35
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:06,818
We're all doomed to die
for this act of desecration!

36
00:06:06,845 --> 00:06:08,196
You're a fool, Hashmi!

37
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:11,010
If you believe that you can pull the wool
over my eyes with these old legends...

38
00:06:11,086 --> 00:06:13,857
It is not wool that has obscured
your eyes, Mr Bray, but a lack of vision!

39
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,347
The tomb holds no curses, Hashmi...

40
00:06:19,619 --> 00:06:21,942
only the bones and belongings
of an ancient prince!

41
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:24,606
Good can come of this
discovery, but not evil!

42
00:06:29,378 --> 00:06:30,541
Annette, what is it?

43
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,745
Hussein, lower him down.

44
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,720
Hussein, you are too quick.
You are your mother's son.

45
00:07:01,242 --> 00:07:05,497
- All clear on your end, John?
- Yes, all clear here, sir.

46
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:07,851
Gently, now. Gently.

47
00:07:10,444 --> 00:07:12,777
Gently. That's it!

48
00:07:13,353 --> 00:07:15,169
- Well done, Ahmed.
- Good, sir.

49
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:20,058
Well, that's the last. I never
thought we'd do it in a week.

50
00:07:22,222 --> 00:07:24,046
Everything recorded and accounted for.

51
00:07:25,147 --> 00:07:27,667
Annette, put these somewhere
safe, would you please?

52
00:07:33,108 --> 00:07:37,143
- Well, Sir Giles, you look
five years younger.
- I feel it.

53
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:39,272
We've made archeological history.

54
00:07:39,534 --> 00:07:43,663
We can present to the museum the finest
mummified specimen ever known.

55
00:07:43,751 --> 00:07:46,671
And treasures from the tomb
far beyond our wildest expectations.

56
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,708
It's a moment of triumph...
for you, for me, for all mankind.

57
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,984
Come in, Hashmi! We were
just going to celebrate.

58
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,581
Your government must be
very pleased with you.

59
00:07:56,908 --> 00:07:58,151
Let's all have some champagne.

60
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,739
Gentlemen, before you get too full
of high spirits - we have a visitor.

61
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:04,387
- Your benefactor, Mr Alexander King.
- Mr King? Here?

62
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:10,214
This is a surprise - but only fitting that
he should be here to join us.

63
00:08:10,226 --> 00:08:11,751
In the office.

64
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:20,096
- Here you are, John.
- Thank You.

65
00:08:24,488 --> 00:08:28,290
If you'd only learn to play chess,
we could make a fortune.

66
00:08:28,256 --> 00:08:30,738
Mr King - this is a pleasant surprise.

67
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,610
Giles, baby! Good to see you!

68
00:08:32,698 --> 00:08:35,506
Hashmi. Hold this a minute,
will you? Thank you.

69
00:08:35,664 --> 00:08:38,705
Got a little present here for you.
Brought it from Constantinople.

70
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:42,761
Turkish candy. Go on, try a bit.

71
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,784
You, too, Old Inscrutible. Go ahead.

72
00:08:48,852 --> 00:08:50,531
Take a piece. I want your opinion.

73
00:08:51,044 --> 00:08:53,050
That's enough of that. No, no, no.

74
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:55,957
- Well, what do you think?
- It's, eh... delightful.

75
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,357
That's it! Delightful. Full of delight!

76
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:05,022
We'll call it Turkish Delight!

77
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,409
Well, how are things going?

78
00:09:07,426 --> 00:09:12,258
Well, Mr King, as you are the
financial backer of our expedition,

79
00:09:12,671 --> 00:09:16,364
I am very happy to
tell you that Hashmi Bey...

80
00:09:16,438 --> 00:09:19,353
has obtained a handsome
offer from the Cairo Museum.

81
00:09:19,395 --> 00:09:20,803
How handsome is handsome?

82
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:26,236
For the complete contents
of the tomb of Ra 70,000 pounds!

83
00:09:26,127 --> 00:09:28,892
70,000 pounds?!

84
00:09:29,983 --> 00:09:33,900
70,000 pounds! Did you hear that?
You must be out of your mind.

85
00:09:34,046 --> 00:09:38,692
No, I'm going to road show this mummy
throughout the world. That way
we'll make 700,000 pounds!

86
00:09:38,332 --> 00:09:41,150
- You can't, sir.
- What do you mean can't? Don't tell me I can't!

87
00:09:41,989 --> 00:09:44,791
Oh, you kids stick with me!
You'll see some real money!

88
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:46,477
But this is unheard of.

89
00:09:46,506 --> 00:09:50,131
Relics of this importance and value
cannot be treated as a sideshow!

90
00:09:50,213 --> 00:09:51,392
It's blatant sacrilege.

91
00:09:51,438 --> 00:09:53,617
Oh! Nothing sacrilegious
about making money.

92
00:09:54,644 --> 00:09:57,648
If this is your serious intention,
and not some form of humor

93
00:09:57,676 --> 00:10:00,014
then I shall be forced to discuss
the matter with my superiors.

94
00:10:00,061 --> 00:10:02,443
Good. You go right ahead and
do that little thing, Buddy Boy.

95
00:10:04,195 --> 00:10:09,064
Sir Giles, I trust that your integrity and
good faith will finally prevail in this matter.

96
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:16,374
Then there are certain steps I must take.
So, if you will excuse me, sir.

97
00:10:18,864 --> 00:10:19,770
Bye!

98
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,649
They're all alike. Always getting
in a stew over something.

99
00:10:24,012 --> 00:10:25,626
Well, let him check!

100
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:27,698
He'll find out there isn't a
cotton pickin' thing he can do about it.

101
00:10:27,624 --> 00:10:30,202
Now, let's get down to details.
Oh, this is for you.

102
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:34,250
- We open in London on the 3rd of March.
- You really are serious?

103
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:36,614
Well, Sir Giles, like I said, we've
got to go where the money is.

104
00:10:36,617 --> 00:10:38,670
- But this!
- You remember when they opened the tomb?

105
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:40,520
I was standing right beside you.

106
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,129
I was as excited as a kid
with a double sarsaparilla.

107
00:10:43,211 --> 00:10:46,469
You told me we'd made a great
discovery... for the good of all mankind.

108
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:50,249
Well, who's in a better position
to do that good... you or me?

109
00:10:50,347 --> 00:10:56,197
You'll put it in some stuffy museum
in a one camel town where nobody will see it but
a few tourists on a wet afternoon.

110
00:10:56,361 --> 00:10:58,099
I can show it to the world.

111
00:10:58,356 --> 00:11:01,049
If people want to be
educated, I'll educate them.

112
00:11:01,126 --> 00:11:02,649
At 10 cents a time.

113
00:11:02,988 --> 00:11:09,571
Mr King... if you persist in this
childish exhibitionism

114
00:11:09,933 --> 00:11:14,568
I shall have no alternative but to withdraw
from any further responsibility in this matter!

115
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:16,949
Now then, who's being childish?

116
00:11:28,735 --> 00:11:30,959
Well, hello there. Still having fun, I see.

117
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:33,330
- And you, Mr King.
- Good to see you again.

118
00:11:33,343 --> 00:11:36,213
Glad to hear you say that. We're going to
be seeing a lot of each other from now on.

119
00:11:36,298 --> 00:11:38,085
What do you mean?
The job's nearly finished.

120
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:41,410
There's been a slight change
in plans. We're all going on to London.

121
00:11:41,508 --> 00:11:43,603
- What?
- With you in charge.

122
00:11:43,888 --> 00:11:47,176
- Hey, wait a minute. Sir Giles is in charge.
- He's leaving the buggy ride here.

123
00:11:47,218 --> 00:11:50,497
- I don't follow.
- It's true, John. I've resigned.

124
00:11:51,895 --> 00:11:55,768
And in the interests of the expedition,
I suggest you accept Mr King's offer.

125
00:11:55,813 --> 00:11:57,386
Yes, but what's happened?

126
00:11:57,478 --> 00:11:59,951
I think it's better if Mr King
explains it to you.

127
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:04,401
Okay. Have dinner with me
tonight and I'll fill you in.

128
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,027
I know a place where we can
sample all the local delicacies.

129
00:12:50,224 --> 00:12:52,812
That's what I like to see - people
enjoying themselves.

130
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,530
Oh, we're going to get along fine.

131
00:12:54,656 --> 00:12:57,073
You have made up your mind to
stick with me on this, haven't you?

132
00:12:57,121 --> 00:12:58,430
Yes, I think so, Mr King.

133
00:12:58,572 --> 00:13:02,879
And I agree. It's a pity that Sir Giles
couldn't see your point of view.

134
00:13:02,884 --> 00:13:05,561
He's living in the past.
This is 1900 - you have to think modern.

135
00:13:06,168 --> 00:13:07,828
What do you two kids
plan for the future?

136
00:13:08,369 --> 00:13:11,262
Well, I hope a long life,
and a happy one. Together.

137
00:13:12,193 --> 00:13:14,230
You're not worried about
the Curse of the Pharaohs, eh?

138
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:17,926
- So, you know about that, do you?
- Know about it? I wish I had invented it.

139
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:22,471
"Anybody that opens the Pharaoh's
tomb is doomed to die horribly. "

140
00:13:22,497 --> 00:13:25,387
There's thousands of dollars
of free publicity in that.

141
00:13:25,653 --> 00:13:28,511
And don't think I'm not going
to ballyhoo it in my campaign.

142
00:13:28,803 --> 00:13:32,596
Well, as my friend Phineas T. Barnum said:
"There's one born every minute".

143
00:13:32,638 --> 00:13:35,789
And they'll love this. The public
loves to live dangerously.

144
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:37,703
As long as there's no real danger in it.

145
00:13:37,978 --> 00:13:40,517
Say, maybe 10 cents isn't enough.

146
00:13:41,386 --> 00:13:48,340
Effendi, I bring urgent message from
your master. He says you must come quickly!

147
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,788
- You bring a message from whom?
- From Sir Gilly!

148
00:13:51,147 --> 00:13:53,560
- Gilly!
- Oh - he means Sir Giles!

149
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:55,938
Then we must go.
It must be important.

150
00:13:55,993 --> 00:13:57,917
Well now, wait a minute.
I'm going with you.

151
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:12,389
If you ever learn to do that to Ragtime,
give me a call. We'll make a fortune.

152
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:33,860
Thank Heaven, nothing appears
to have been broken.

153
00:14:35,871 --> 00:14:38,889
They were obviously searching
for something - but what?

154
00:14:40,363 --> 00:14:43,999
If we could answer that question,
we'd know who they were.

155
00:14:45,355 --> 00:14:49,247
They have not taken gold or jewels
that most men would covet.

156
00:14:51,055 --> 00:14:54,275
- What's happened, Sir Giles?
- The place has been ransacked.

157
00:14:54,349 --> 00:14:57,670
- Anything stolen?
- No, nothing as far as we can see.

158
00:14:57,765 --> 00:14:58,639
- Inspector, sir.
- Yes?

159
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:00,159
I have found something over there.

160
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,985
I suggest Miss, that you stay here.

161
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:26,127
<i>John! Come here!</i>

162
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,741
- What is it Darling?
- Your lists have gone.

163
00:15:29,817 --> 00:15:31,368
Blast! And there were no copies!

164
00:15:31,453 --> 00:15:35,473
Three months' work wasted. But why?
What possible use could they be to anyone else?

165
00:15:35,571 --> 00:15:38,332
If one wants to know the
complete contents of the tomb

166
00:15:38,401 --> 00:15:40,381
your lists are the quickest way.

167
00:15:40,526 --> 00:15:44,347
Then that means we are not the only
people interested in the treasures of Ra.

168
00:16:16,301 --> 00:16:20,781
I remember a night just like this
when we were on our way to Egypt.

169
00:16:21,072 --> 00:16:22,803
Yes, I remember it too, Darling.

170
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,872
Do you realize that was
almost a year ago?

171
00:16:26,544 --> 00:16:29,279
- That was a happy voyage.
- Yes, it was.

172
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:32,634
- But now...
- What do you mean?

173
00:16:33,022 --> 00:16:37,840
I don't quite know, John. But somehow,
whenever I am near the mummy...

174
00:16:37,787 --> 00:16:44,748
Oh, you needn't worry about it. It's safely
locked up in the hold clearly labeled:
"Not wanted on board".

175
00:16:47,414 --> 00:16:53,067
You know, the only real physical danger
you may be in is not from the mummy.

176
00:16:53,663 --> 00:16:56,668
But... from... me.

177
00:16:57,652 --> 00:17:00,689
- Don't, John. Please.
- I'm sorry.

178
00:17:01,181 --> 00:17:05,676
I'm not just being silly.
There is something. I feel it.

179
00:17:06,246 --> 00:17:08,097
But I just can't explain it.

180
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:11,634
I'm afraid it wasn't a very good joke,
was it? Will you forgive me?

181
00:17:24,401 --> 00:17:28,078
- Goodnight, Sir Giles.
- Good Evening, my dear.

182
00:17:30,493 --> 00:17:35,642
You look very beautiful.
Goodnight.

183
00:17:38,031 --> 00:17:39,913
- Goodnight, john.
- Goodnight, Sir Giles.

184
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:46,289
You know, if he carries on like this,
he'll soon be as pickled as the mummy.

185
00:17:46,811 --> 00:17:49,090
That's not very nice.

186
00:17:50,032 --> 00:17:53,140
It's all because Mr King
has had a deep effect on him.

187
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:59,629
And what's more, the Egyptian authorities
have as good as told him he has conducted his last
expedition anywhere on their territory.

188
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,909
Yes, I know. It's quite ridiculous.
It's King who is to blame, but they

189
00:18:02,918 --> 00:18:04,476
probably won't believe it.

190
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,049
What will Sir Giles do?

191
00:18:07,144 --> 00:18:09,150
He may have to retire.
He's no longer a youngster.

192
00:18:09,275 --> 00:18:14,558
Oh, that would be a great waste. He knows
more about ancient Egypt that any other person.

193
00:18:15,254 --> 00:18:17,241
That's Sir Giles. Stay there!

194
00:19:05,256 --> 00:19:07,138
Man overboard!

195
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:11,708
- Man overboard!
- Man overboard!

196
00:19:38,968 --> 00:19:44,258
- John. What happened?
- I'm afraid a man attacked Sir Giles.

197
00:19:44,341 --> 00:19:47,153
- Is he badly hurt?
- No, fortunately not.

198
00:19:47,576 --> 00:19:51,325
Just a lump on his head and
a headache. I'm afraid I've got one too.

199
00:19:51,388 --> 00:19:53,067
Was he robbed?

200
00:19:53,896 --> 00:19:57,452
I don't think it was
money the man was after.

201
00:19:57,527 --> 00:20:01,192
Oh, please let me introduce:
Adam Beauchamp, John Bray.

202
00:20:01,286 --> 00:20:02,789
- How do you do.
- How do you do.

203
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:05,809
If it wasn't money he was after,
do you know what it was he wanted?

204
00:20:05,967 --> 00:20:07,401
No, I'm not quite sure.

205
00:20:08,046 --> 00:20:10,740
You think it had something
to do with Ra, don't you?

206
00:20:10,774 --> 00:20:14,615
- It could have, yes.
- You see, both John and I...

207
00:20:14,628 --> 00:20:18,967
My dear, your recent discovery
is far too well known to need explanations.

208
00:20:19,148 --> 00:20:21,932
But surely, Sir Giles doesn't keep
any of the treasures in his cabin.

209
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:23,308
Oh, no, no. Certainly not.

210
00:20:23,487 --> 00:20:26,092
The treasures are in the
ship's hold under heavy guard.

211
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:29,300
But certain things have happened
which lead me to believe that

212
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:32,861
somebody may be trying to force us
to return the treasures to Egypt.

213
00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:34,425
And what are your plans?

214
00:20:34,495 --> 00:20:37,243
Well, we're going to London, where
I shall continue my retabulations,

215
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,149
and then we shall
set up the first exhibition.

216
00:20:39,206 --> 00:20:40,670
Where will you stay?

217
00:20:40,714 --> 00:20:43,246
Well, I've booked rooms for Annette
and I at the hotel in Bloomsbury.

218
00:20:43,314 --> 00:20:44,743
Well, that's not good enough.

219
00:20:44,762 --> 00:20:47,122
I live on my own in a large
house in Regent's Park.

220
00:20:47,168 --> 00:20:48,634
Why don't you stay with me?

221
00:20:48,736 --> 00:20:52,787
- Sorry, that's quite out of the question.
- That's very kind of you, Adam.

222
00:20:52,868 --> 00:20:55,485
Your work facinates me.
I find you charming people.

223
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:58,627
I've always felt that I should devote
more of my time to the arts.

224
00:20:58,729 --> 00:21:00,305
This could be my small beginning.

225
00:21:00,463 --> 00:21:03,374
I wish I could assist
your ambitions, Mr Beauchamp,

226
00:21:03,477 --> 00:21:05,738
but I'm afraid we can't alter
our plans at this late stage.

227
00:21:05,773 --> 00:21:09,353
But of course you can. Join me for
a liqueur and we'll discuss it.

228
00:21:09,537 --> 00:21:11,793
How very nice of you, Adam.

229
00:21:12,161 --> 00:21:14,100
Now look, really.
This is going a little too far.

230
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,950
- Not at all.
- We've made other arrangements.

231
00:21:22,212 --> 00:21:23,623
Come in, Jessop.

232
00:21:24,132 --> 00:21:27,959
We could all do with a hot toddy to get
this blasted English fog out of our throats.

233
00:21:27,988 --> 00:21:31,028
- That sounds delicious.
- Thank you, Jessop.

234
00:21:33,843 --> 00:21:37,614
You look tired, John.
I trust this will revive you.

235
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:39,133
Thank you.

236
00:21:40,207 --> 00:21:43,682
- You find them interesting, Annette?
- The are so lovely, Adam.

237
00:21:44,634 --> 00:21:47,019
Faberge is a great artist.

238
00:21:51,873 --> 00:21:54,528
This once belonged to
the Empress of Russia.

239
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:58,365
I've always felt that it should again
belong to a beautiful woman.

240
00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:00,311
I would like you to have it.

241
00:22:01,459 --> 00:22:03,555
But Adam, this is priceless.

242
00:22:03,425 --> 00:22:07,382
It is valueless compared to the pleasure
it will give me to think of it in your posession.

243
00:22:07,591 --> 00:22:10,868
Then it would be ungracious
of me not to accept.

244
00:22:16,264 --> 00:22:22,032
- John. Look what Adam has given me!
- Oh, yes. Very pretty, isn't it?

245
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:26,170
- May I have another drink, please?
- Yes, of course.

246
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,172
- Annette... some punch?
- Thank you, Adam.

247
00:22:32,244 --> 00:22:33,219
Yes, Jessop?

248
00:22:33,283 --> 00:22:36,328
Mrs Brody asks for your
instructions about dinner, sir.

249
00:22:36,407 --> 00:22:40,714
- What do you say, Annette? Nine o'clock?
- That would be just fine.

250
00:22:41,465 --> 00:22:44,569
- John?
- Oh, I'm so sorry, Annette.

251
00:22:44,661 --> 00:22:47,594
I'm afraid that I can't stay.
But you do by all means.

252
00:22:47,512 --> 00:22:49,123
You see, the treasures are being
delivered this evening

253
00:22:49,213 --> 00:22:52,036
and I promised Mr King that
I'd be there to supervise the uncrating.

254
00:22:52,344 --> 00:22:55,331
Oh, then perhaps I should
go along with you.

255
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:59,527
- You will forgive us?
- Of course, my Dear, I understand.

256
00:23:00,874 --> 00:23:02,274
- But why don't you come with us?

257
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,749
Well, I'd love to, if you're sure
I won't be in the way.

258
00:23:04,764 --> 00:23:08,419
- Don't be silly. He won't be, will he John?
- No, of course not.

259
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,243
Do come, by all means.
You're quite welcome.

260
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,994
That's settled, then.

261
00:23:14,706 --> 00:23:19,299
May I propose a toast: To the success
of the exhibition of Ra.

262
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:23,138
And may the gods smile down
upon our new formed friendship.

263
00:23:33,382 --> 00:23:35,558
The mummy goes in the exact center
of that area over there.

264
00:23:35,753 --> 00:23:37,203
- The exact center, you understand?
- Yes, sir.

265
00:23:37,303 --> 00:23:39,394
- Well, start measuring right away!
- Yes, Mr King!

266
00:23:39,443 --> 00:23:40,711
May I have your attention
one moment, Mr King!

267
00:23:40,758 --> 00:23:41,928
- Are the footlights ready?
- Yes, Mr King.

268
00:23:42,008 --> 00:23:43,710
Well then, turn them on right away!

269
00:23:47,211 --> 00:23:49,259
A beautiful thing, isn't it?

270
00:23:49,348 --> 00:23:52,754
Would somebody please
get me John Bray right away!

271
00:23:53,459 --> 00:23:57,392
- Where is the man with the material?!
- Would you like something heavier?

272
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:08,391
- Here lads! Come on! Come on!
- I was just thinking.

273
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:15,052
Has he gone?
Bert! Bert!

274
00:24:15,469 --> 00:24:19,459
Blimey, Fred - looks just like my wife.
I bet you wish it did.

275
00:24:19,576 --> 00:24:22,596
I should think you'd have to get
results like this to take it on the street.

276
00:24:22,851 --> 00:24:25,409
Put it back. It smells funny.

277
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:28,354
These panels from the
doors to the gilded shrine

278
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,001
depict the major happenings
in the life of Ra.

279
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:36,752
- Detail and workmanship is superb.
- Mr Bray! Mr King wants you.

280
00:24:36,884 --> 00:24:39,741
- I suppose he wants me right away.
- Yes, sir!

281
00:24:40,238 --> 00:24:43,249
A whole lifetime contained
in a few pictures.

282
00:24:43,321 --> 00:24:45,994
Probably more than
will be left of our lives.

283
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:51,598
This one shows Ramses VIII being
presented with his twin sons.

284
00:24:51,629 --> 00:24:53,990
Ra, the elder, and Be.

285
00:24:54,108 --> 00:24:57,849
They grew into two very different persons,
both physically and mentally.

286
00:24:58,606 --> 00:25:02,138
Ra became a thinker...
the searcher for truth

287
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,274
and the secret of eternal life.

288
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:08,579
But Be - he was a sensualist...

289
00:25:08,603 --> 00:25:11,088
who spent his time only seeking
pleasure for his body.

290
00:25:11,871 --> 00:25:14,297
- That is the legend?
- Yes.

291
00:25:14,352 --> 00:25:18,742
But substantiated in the drawings and
tales handed down through the ages,

292
00:25:18,787 --> 00:25:20,020
which make it fact.

293
00:25:20,967 --> 00:25:24,188
Then please go on. I'd like to
hear the rest of the facts.

294
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,834
Be was jealous of his younger
brother's position and popularity.

295
00:25:30,852 --> 00:25:34,948
And suspicious of his
profound thinking and deep wisdom.

296
00:25:35,203 --> 00:25:38,683
And he continuously conspired
to have Ra branded as a witch.

297
00:25:39,092 --> 00:25:41,132
So successful was he,

298
00:25:41,194 --> 00:25:45,212
that the aging Rameses,
in an effort to avoid civil war,

299
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,724
was forced to accept
the will of the people

300
00:25:47,816 --> 00:25:50,304
and to banish his favorite son.

301
00:25:52,568 --> 00:25:54,813
After months of wandering,

302
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:58,648
Ra and his small band
of faithful followers

303
00:25:58,685 --> 00:26:01,582
were befriended by an
ancient nomadic people.

304
00:26:01,667 --> 00:26:04,415
Deep in the remote
part of the Sahara.

305
00:26:11,976 --> 00:26:13,746
As time passed,

306
00:26:13,855 --> 00:26:18,804
the tribe of nomads became so
impressed with Ra's dignity and learning,

307
00:26:19,131 --> 00:26:22,909
that they asked him to become
their king, and rule over them.

308
00:26:24,407 --> 00:26:29,473
At his coronation, they
presented him with a small medallion,

309
00:26:29,535 --> 00:26:33,596
on which had been inscribed
the sacred Words of Life,

310
00:26:34,035 --> 00:26:38,036
used only in the rare ceremony
of reviving the dead,

311
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:41,747
a secret which had been
in their posession for centuries.

312
00:26:51,963 --> 00:26:55,016
Ra then made plans
to return to his homeland,

313
00:26:55,157 --> 00:26:58,747
so that he could set right
the wrongs that had been done to him.

314
00:27:00,556 --> 00:27:03,999
In preparation, Ra prayed to Bubastis,

315
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:06,598
the most powerful of all the gods,

316
00:27:07,053 --> 00:27:08,724
for spiritual guidance

317
00:27:08,895 --> 00:27:12,432
on how to use the secret
of the Words of Life wisely,

318
00:27:12,818 --> 00:27:16,352
and for the physical strength
to carry out his mission.

319
00:27:24,096 --> 00:27:28,397
But Be, hearing of his brother's plans,

320
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,890
sent assassins into the desert
to find and kill Ra.

321
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:41,581
They attacked without warning, and showing
no mercy, killed nomads and priests alike.

322
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:04,971
As Ra lay dying,

323
00:28:06,497 --> 00:28:11,201
they cut off his left hand, on which
he wore his rings of his birth.

324
00:28:11,895 --> 00:28:16,448
They took it back to Be, as proof
that their foul work was done.

325
00:28:30,472 --> 00:28:32,165
They missed the medallion.

326
00:28:32,989 --> 00:28:34,270
What did you say, Adam?

327
00:28:34,889 --> 00:28:38,988
I'm sorry - I was just commenting
that the assassins missed the medallion.

328
00:28:39,066 --> 00:28:40,805
What happened to it, do you think?

329
00:28:40,926 --> 00:28:43,388
It was almost certainly buried
with him in his tomb in the desert.

330
00:28:43,438 --> 00:28:45,420
Was it found amongst
the treasures of the tomb?

331
00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:46,530
But...

332
00:28:46,626 --> 00:28:49,719
- Well, was it?!
- No. But perhaps...

333
00:28:49,757 --> 00:28:52,368
Then your facts are
no more than legend, after all.

334
00:28:52,449 --> 00:28:53,328
Adam!

335
00:28:53,428 --> 00:28:55,851
We've got the mummiform
coffin in position now.

336
00:28:55,927 --> 00:28:56,930
Would you care to see it?

337
00:28:57,543 --> 00:29:00,739
Adam. John says would you
like to see the mummy?

338
00:29:01,096 --> 00:29:04,329
- Yes, I would very much.
- Come along, then.

339
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,684
Come on, boys. He wants us to
try it once again in there. Come on.

340
00:29:08,767 --> 00:29:13,485
These Americans - they're impossible.
But Never mind, Lets do it, That's right.

341
00:29:15,076 --> 00:29:20,584
Now Mr King - I must have your
final decision: Velvet, lace, or chennile?

342
00:29:20,648 --> 00:29:21,666
Mosquito netting.

343
00:29:22,667 --> 00:29:24,861
Ah ha! There you are!
Come on in! Take a look!

344
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,392
- Yeah? What do you think?
- I am very impressed.

345
00:29:30,447 --> 00:29:33,788
- And when you open the coffin?
- Sure! Want to see what happens?

346
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:58,813
- Blimey, Fred, what's happening?
- They're opening that coffin.

347
00:29:59,976 --> 00:30:03,430
- Well, they can do it without me!
- Without me, too!

348
00:30:28,708 --> 00:30:31,162
He's worth ten cents
of anybody's money.

349
00:30:31,226 --> 00:30:34,609
- Mr King, you are an incredible man.
- Well...

350
00:30:36,089 --> 00:30:40,112
...some of us have got it. And the others
ride home in a horse and cart.

351
00:30:47,076 --> 00:30:50,372
- Jenny? What are you doing?

352
00:30:50,595 --> 00:30:52,715
The young lady mislaid her handkerchief
and I thought see might want it.

353
00:30:53,198 --> 00:30:57,358
Well, you run along to bed now, Jenny. Mr Beauchamp
has given instructions that he's not to be disturbed.

354
00:30:57,381 --> 00:30:59,670
Let's hope the other gentleman doesn't
come back and disturb him.

355
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:02,406
That's enough of that!
You run along.

356
00:31:08,988 --> 00:31:11,159
<i>...and then, when my mother died...</i>

357
00:31:11,249 --> 00:31:15,007
...my father went to Paris to lecture
at the Museum of Egyptology.

358
00:31:15,118 --> 00:31:19,345
- It was 6 years before I saw him again.
- Why didn't he take you with him?

359
00:31:19,395 --> 00:31:22,692
- I was a great dissapointment to him.
- Why was that?

360
00:31:22,723 --> 00:31:26,021
- He always wanted a son.
- What a very foolish man.

361
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:29,484
Yes, but it did work out for him.

362
00:31:29,566 --> 00:31:33,390
In order to get his love I've studied
twice as hard as any son would have.

363
00:31:33,403 --> 00:31:36,873
I read everything he wrote, and
anything else I could lay my hands on.

364
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,699
So that by the time I went to Paris,
I could converse with him on his own level.

365
00:31:40,787 --> 00:31:43,011
- He was surprised?
- He was delighted,

366
00:31:43,088 --> 00:31:45,269
and insisted I join him as his assistant.

367
00:31:45,311 --> 00:31:47,855
- So the story has a happy ending.
- Yes.

368
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:52,034
Until that night in the desert.

369
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,066
Well, all that's behind you now.

370
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:00,021
Here's to the future.

371
00:32:05,232 --> 00:32:10,393
- Excellent brandy.
- The perfect blend of just the right ingredients.

372
00:32:11,499 --> 00:32:17,473
Like beauty and intelligence in a woman.
But it often disturbs me

373
00:32:17,508 --> 00:32:20,725
when women use their intelligence
only for academic pursuits.

374
00:32:20,842 --> 00:32:24,453
What would you have us do?
Sit at home with our embroidery?

375
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:28,507
No, my dear. You've missed the point entirely.
Intelligence can be as gainfully employed

376
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,084
in the home as in the Academy.

377
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:33,185
You surprise me, Adam.
You are the first man I've met

378
00:32:33,226 --> 00:32:36,270
who really understands what
a home could mean to a woman.

379
00:32:36,544 --> 00:32:40,242
-  Doesn't John?
- No, not completely.

380
00:32:40,273 --> 00:32:43,745
He is prepared to marry me and
allow me to continue with my career.

381
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,761
- But if only he felt as you do.
- But you will marry him?

382
00:32:51,713 --> 00:32:53,420
I'm not sure, yet.

383
00:32:53,487 --> 00:32:56,883
Then I emplore you to be
certain before you decide.

384
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:59,816
A wasted life is tragedy enough,
but for you to throw away

385
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:02,810
yours on compromise
would be doubly tragic.

386
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:08,561
- You are very considerate, Adam.
- And you are very beautiful, Annette.

387
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:12,201
<i>Yes, sir. They're both
in the sitting room, sir.</i>

388
00:33:13,131 --> 00:33:17,241
Sorry I'm late. I'm afraid Mr King's New World
charm is beginning to wear thin.

389
00:33:17,368 --> 00:33:19,695
If he continues to work me
as hard as he's doing now...

390
00:33:20,077 --> 00:33:23,559
I shall soon be as moribund
as the mummy.

391
00:33:23,698 --> 00:33:26,408
Are you very tired? Would you
like to eat in your room?

392
00:33:27,123 --> 00:33:29,105
Thank you, I have eaten.

393
00:33:29,589 --> 00:33:32,252
However, I wouldn't say no
to a drink if offered one.

394
00:33:32,312 --> 00:33:35,419
- Forgive me. Brandy?
- Yes, if it's not too much trouble.

395
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:42,265
Annette, what's that?
I don't believe I've seen that before.

396
00:33:42,337 --> 00:33:44,783
- It's just a medallion.
- Just a medallion?

397
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:49,346
- Did he give it to you?
- No, my father did - the day he died.

398
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:53,093
- May I see that?
- Of course.

399
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,304
Is it from the tomb?

400
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,533
No, of course not, John.
Do you think my father would take...

401
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:03,946
It can't be from the tomb.

402
00:34:04,567 --> 00:34:08,288
Both the stone and the hieroglyphics are
at least 2,000 years older than that.

403
00:34:09,188 --> 00:34:15,666
- These are early Old Kingdom.
- Really? How would you know that?

404
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:19,248
My interest in your work
is not entirely an amateur one,

405
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,773
But my studies were of an
earlier period than the Egyptian.

406
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:23,166
Here... see for yourself.

407
00:34:24,995 --> 00:34:27,374
I'm sorry. I can't agree with that.

408
00:34:27,468 --> 00:34:29,719
I still believe it could be from the tomb.

409
00:34:29,764 --> 00:34:32,317
Let me assure you, Mr Bray,
it is Old Kingdom.

410
00:34:32,922 --> 00:34:35,329
Nobody could be as certain as you are,
Mr Beauchamp...

411
00:34:35,378 --> 00:34:37,022
without extensive examination.

412
00:34:37,098 --> 00:34:40,975
Then why don't you reserve judgement
until you have made an extensive examination?

413
00:34:41,965 --> 00:34:43,129
Very well.

414
00:34:44,146 --> 00:34:46,157
With your permission, Annette.
I will.

415
00:34:46,593 --> 00:34:49,419
There's only one person I know who has
reference books from this period, and that is Sir Giles.

416
00:34:49,646 --> 00:34:53,631
- I'd like him to see this now.
- No... he won't be in bed yet.

417
00:34:53,753 --> 00:34:56,708
If you'll both forgive me,
I'll start straight away.

418
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:00,349
Jessop will get you a hansom.

419
00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:14,011
Well, my dear... another brandy?

420
00:35:16,872 --> 00:35:19,180
If money is to be the yardstick

421
00:35:19,197 --> 00:35:21,729
by which the value of education
is to be assessed,

422
00:35:21,847 --> 00:35:23,701
then I fear for the future.

423
00:35:24,138 --> 00:35:28,129
Let's make the redoubtable Mr King
headmaster at Eton and be done with it.

424
00:35:28,249 --> 00:35:33,541
Within 6 months he'll turn the playing field
into a miniature Coney Island...

425
00:35:33,684 --> 00:35:37,738
with each boy a barker
on a share of the profits.

426
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:41,508
Well, at least their arithmetic
would have to be good

427
00:35:41,527 --> 00:35:43,687
if only to make sure
they're getting their fair share.

428
00:35:44,836 --> 00:35:46,073
Now, let me see...

429
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:50,391
Who ever heard of an egyptologist
who wasn't allowed into Egypt?

430
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:53,332
There's no Court of Appeal, you know.

431
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:57,820
- What page did he say?
- That damned Hashmi!

432
00:35:57,973 --> 00:36:01,357
I didn't hear him tell
the authorities that it was King

433
00:36:02,547 --> 00:36:05,067
who was reponsible
for removing the relics.

434
00:36:05,668 --> 00:36:10,849
- Yes, Sir Giles. What page?
- Oh, sorry, um...

435
00:36:11,328 --> 00:36:14,656
- Somewhere in the 300's, I think..
- Thank you.

436
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:19,968
- What do you make of it?
- Well, I'm not quite certain, but I think...

437
00:36:20,049 --> 00:36:22,208
Oh! You clumsy, drunken, old...

438
00:36:36,052 --> 00:36:39,639
I see I've now lost your respect, too.

439
00:36:41,054 --> 00:36:44,386
You are undoubtedly better
left alone to your studies.

440
00:36:44,464 --> 00:36:46,773
- I'm sorry, Sir Giles...
- Goodnight, John.

441
00:37:23,853 --> 00:37:27,171
I wonder. Could it be?

442
00:38:57,249 --> 00:38:59,466
This is not a joking matter, Mr King.

443
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,276
I would have thought the sum of
120,000 English pounds

444
00:39:03,338 --> 00:39:05,241
would have wiped the smile
even from your face.

445
00:39:05,305 --> 00:39:06,494
Its chicken feed.

446
00:39:07,102 --> 00:39:10,294
You seriously expect me to pack up
this whole kit-and-kaboodle and ship it back

447
00:39:10,323 --> 00:39:14,660
My government will gladly accept the
responsibility of the transportation charges!

448
00:39:15,326 --> 00:39:16,826
That's more chicken feed.

449
00:39:17,953 --> 00:39:21,369
My show is advertised
clear across the United States.

450
00:39:22,307 --> 00:39:26,690
Now, you don't want me to disappoint
all those Mid-western people, do you?

451
00:39:26,844 --> 00:39:28,579
You know what a circus means to them?

452
00:39:29,552 --> 00:39:31,291
An outing for the whole family.

453
00:39:31,394 --> 00:39:32,768
A day to remember.

454
00:39:33,115 --> 00:39:36,107
It's obvious to me that you're
a very difficult man to deal with.

455
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,250
Who, me?

456
00:39:37,685 --> 00:39:40,818
For the last time I beg of you
to accept my government's offer.

457
00:39:42,044 --> 00:39:44,674
Then, the consequences of
the actions you contemplate

458
00:39:44,712 --> 00:39:47,381
must rest upon your own head.

459
00:39:47,623 --> 00:39:50,425
Well, then... let the
consequences commence!

460
00:39:54,805 --> 00:39:56,758
Hiya, beautiful! How do I look?

461
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,471
You will put Ra to shame.

462
00:40:00,459 --> 00:40:02,951
Gee, I'm sorry John
can't be here. How is he?

463
00:40:03,024 --> 00:40:06,555
He's still at Sir Giles. The doctor
wouldn't let him be moved.

464
00:40:06,587 --> 00:40:09,030
A nice kid. Now, who would
want to do a thing like that?

465
00:40:09,104 --> 00:40:11,376
We won't know that until he can tell us.

466
00:40:11,401 --> 00:40:13,902
And he hasn't fully regained
consciousness yet.

467
00:40:13,932 --> 00:40:15,170
Let's hope it will be soon.

468
00:40:15,515 --> 00:40:17,551
- Beauchamp.
- King.

469
00:40:17,588 --> 00:40:19,609
I see you have all the
important press here.

470
00:40:19,611 --> 00:40:23,137
And their friends. They all show up
when they know it's free.

471
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:26,819
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have a show to put on.

472
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:29,448
Hello. How are you?
How are you?

473
00:40:41,303 --> 00:40:44,867
Distinguished guests, ladies
and gentlemen of the press...

474
00:40:44,911 --> 00:40:47,409
...this is an historic moment.

475
00:40:47,771 --> 00:40:55,149
Today we will open the 3,000 year
old coffin of Ra-Antef - Royal Prince of Egypt.

476
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:56,764
But - first of all...

477
00:40:56,845 --> 00:40:59,691
I want you to absorb
some of the atmosphere...

478
00:41:00,106 --> 00:41:03,169
...much as it must have been
to those intrepid explorers

479
00:41:03,174 --> 00:41:06,858
led my my great and good friend,
Sir Giles Dalrymple...

480
00:41:06,915 --> 00:41:09,161
...your premiere archaeologist.

481
00:41:11,288 --> 00:41:14,949
Our story starts almost
18 months ago to this very day,

482
00:41:15,126 --> 00:41:17,818
when he led the expedition,
including myself

483
00:41:17,981 --> 00:41:19,405
into the Valley of Kings.

484
00:41:21,035 --> 00:41:24,412
A leading member of our team
was Professor Eugene Dubois...

485
00:41:24,478 --> 00:41:26,348
from the Paris Museum of Egyptology,

486
00:41:26,375 --> 00:41:29,967
who unfortunately lost his life at the
hands of the superstitious natives

487
00:41:30,015 --> 00:41:32,524
only shortly before
our work was completed.

488
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:37,404
With him is John Bray, a brilliant young
Egyptologist from Cambridge University.

489
00:41:38,698 --> 00:41:43,138
The youngest and by far prettiest
member of our team was Annette Dubois...

490
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:48,287
...a breath of Parisian charm that did much
to help cool the hot winds of the desert.

491
00:41:48,329 --> 00:41:49,992
In addition to being decorative,

492
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:54,209
she was an able personal assistant
to her father, the late professor.

493
00:41:54,225 --> 00:41:57,394
The guiding light of the
expedition was, of course...

494
00:41:57,406 --> 00:42:00,307
...No! not him!
Myself.

495
00:42:07,309 --> 00:42:09,777
After a short period of relaxation

496
00:42:09,862 --> 00:42:13,790
there followed 10 months of
intensive searching and excavation,

497
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:16,740
until the discovery of
one small, stone step,

498
00:42:16,724 --> 00:42:20,703
overlooked by both searchers and
plunderers for countless generations,

499
00:42:21,954 --> 00:42:26,021
led us to believe that
we had found a royal burial tomb.

500
00:42:27,594 --> 00:42:31,048
Final feverish excavations
allowed us, six days later,

501
00:42:31,122 --> 00:42:34,214
to be standing on the threshold.

502
00:42:36,241 --> 00:42:38,865
Below us were the first great doors...

503
00:42:40,296 --> 00:42:42,889
...those massive portals to the past.

504
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:57,817
Anubis, the patron of embalming
and guardian of the tomb, stood before us.

505
00:43:01,124 --> 00:43:04,924
As we entered, the dust of
lost centuries filled the air.

506
00:43:05,094 --> 00:43:08,692
It was not a thin dust,
but a heavy dust,

507
00:43:08,617 --> 00:43:12,100
feeling almost as though it contained
the textures and sounds

508
00:43:12,195 --> 00:43:13,980
of a vanished civilization.

509
00:43:14,331 --> 00:43:18,462
It clung to our clothes
and cloyed in our nostrils,

510
00:43:18,557 --> 00:43:22,095
as if in a last desperate
attempt to stop us proceeding.

511
00:43:25,991 --> 00:43:28,171
And then, before us,

512
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:31,543
appeared the two statue
guardians to the inner tomb.

513
00:43:57,113 --> 00:44:01,816
Here, Modern Man was confronted with
the relics of his ancient Egyptian brothers.

514
00:44:01,964 --> 00:44:06,403
Among them were the wardrobe and
personal belongings of the Royal Prince:

515
00:44:06,506 --> 00:44:12,469
Statues of his gods, funeral furniture,
weapons, food.

516
00:44:12,769 --> 00:44:15,836
In fact, everything he would need
to help and protect him

517
00:44:15,946 --> 00:44:19,282
on his journey over
the dark Waters of Death.

518
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:21,222
and into eternity.

519
00:44:23,379 --> 00:44:29,458
Bubastis stood watching over all,
his gaze undimmed.

520
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:36,351
Then, finally, before us stood the
magnificently ornate sarcophagus

521
00:44:36,441 --> 00:44:42,809
bearing upon it the molded likeness
of the body it contained therein.

522
00:44:50,753 --> 00:44:54,411
And now, before the great, historic moment,

523
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:58,798
I must take you into
my confidence and warn you:

524
00:45:01,556 --> 00:45:07,166
There is a curse...
...which says that all persons present

525
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:11,176
at the opening of a Pharaoh's coffin

526
00:45:11,721 --> 00:45:17,480
and who gaze at the face
of the mummy therein, shall die.

527
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:21,760
...struck down by the
wrath of the Egyptian gods!

528
00:45:23,386 --> 00:45:30,521
So... any of you of a nervous disposition,
who wish to leave now...

529
00:45:31,356 --> 00:45:33,053
...may do so.

530
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:40,542
You have been warned!

531
00:45:57,166 --> 00:45:59,415
Ladies and Gentlemen...

532
00:46:00,912 --> 00:46:05,827
...for the very first time...
...and before your very eyes...

533
00:46:06,955 --> 00:46:09,687
...I will cut the Royal Seal.

534
00:46:32,352 --> 00:46:36,091
Alexander King is very proud
to present to you...

535
00:46:36,233 --> 00:46:41,301
the mummy of the Royal Prince Ra-Antef.

536
00:46:50,523 --> 00:46:51,760
Great Scott!

537
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:12,624
I can only ask you again, Mr King:
Who would want to steal a mummy?

538
00:47:12,703 --> 00:47:15,444
Who knows? A Competitor!
Somebody who wants to ruin me.

539
00:47:15,579 --> 00:47:16,491
You have enemies, Mr King?

540
00:47:16,537 --> 00:47:19,151
Of course I've got enemies -
I'm in show business.

541
00:47:19,197 --> 00:47:22,574
Everyone of my friends is an enemy.
He threatened me, for one, tonight.

542
00:47:22,641 --> 00:47:25,969
- Is that correct, sir?
- Threaten him, Inspector? No.

543
00:47:26,397 --> 00:47:28,470
I merely warned him
of what might happen.

544
00:47:28,577 --> 00:47:29,839
That the mummy would be stolen?

545
00:47:29,964 --> 00:47:33,674
- That is the last thing I would have wanted.
- It made his day for him, too.

546
00:47:33,757 --> 00:47:34,720
- Now, why would that be, sir?

547
00:47:34,786 --> 00:47:38,267
Because he wants it safely tucked
away in some stuffy old museum.

548
00:47:38,296 --> 00:47:41,204
And if that's where it had been,
none of this would have happened.

549
00:47:41,874 --> 00:47:43,757
Do you mind if I leave now, Inspector?

550
00:47:43,792 --> 00:47:47,641
Before this colorful American
breaches the English laws of slander.

551
00:47:47,694 --> 00:47:50,394
Yes, that's alright, sir.
I think we can all leave now.

552
00:47:50,594 --> 00:47:52,236
You'll be hearing from us tomorrow, sir.

553
00:47:52,292 --> 00:47:54,525
Is that all you're gonna do?
What about the mummy?!

554
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,189
He could be out of
the country by tomorrow.

555
00:47:56,286 --> 00:47:59,330
I wouldn't worry too much, sir.
He'll never get past the customs.

556
00:47:59,351 --> 00:48:02,891
- Goodnight, Sir - Miss.
- Now, just a minute! Look!

557
00:48:05,464 --> 00:48:07,668
Well, if that's an English policeman,
I should have asked him what time it was.

558
00:48:07,787 --> 00:48:09,177
I would have gotten more out of him.

559
00:48:09,181 --> 00:48:11,618
Don't you think you should
go home and get some rest, Mr King?

560
00:48:11,694 --> 00:48:15,611
Rest?! How can I rest?!
I've got a show with no star!

561
00:48:15,666 --> 00:48:17,653
If there's anything I can do, Mr King...

562
00:48:17,707 --> 00:48:20,473
Yes, if you want to wrap yourself
up in some dirty bandages!

563
00:48:22,388 --> 00:48:25,226
- Goodnight, Mr King.
- Goodnight.

564
00:48:25,792 --> 00:48:26,780
Goodnight!

565
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,306
There ain't no one here, Gov.
They've all just gone.

566
00:48:41,328 --> 00:48:44,634
- Did you see Mr King leave?
- John? I'm on stage.

567
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:49,298
- What are you doing here?
- It's true, then.

568
00:48:49,498 --> 00:48:51,668
I wanted publicity. I sure got it.

569
00:48:52,084 --> 00:48:55,294
- Shouldn't you be in bed?
- I think I know why it happened.

570
00:48:55,388 --> 00:48:56,214
Why?

571
00:48:56,276 --> 00:48:58,338
I found out the meaning
of the Sacred Words of Life.

572
00:48:58,668 --> 00:49:00,252
- But they were stolen from me last night.
- What's that got to do with it?

573
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:04,663
I believe someone may have stolen
the mummy in order to bring it back to life.

574
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:09,524
Must have been some
wallop on the head.

575
00:49:09,548 --> 00:49:10,510
You don't believe me, do you?

576
00:49:10,554 --> 00:49:12,816
Oh, you're real sick, boy.
I'm going to get you a cab.

577
00:49:12,921 --> 00:49:15,934
- Look, Mr King, I can assure you...
- Fred? Get Mr Bray a cab!

578
00:49:16,025 --> 00:49:19,603
- Got one outside, sir.
- If someone really wanted revenge,

579
00:49:19,104 --> 00:49:23,072
what better instrument to use than
the mummy brought back to life?

580
00:49:23,133 --> 00:49:24,190
Sure, sure. Come on.

581
00:49:24,469 --> 00:49:27,755
What better way to cover the real
motive but to blame the legend?

582
00:49:28,024 --> 00:49:30,010
Sleep on it, kid.
I'll see you in the morning.

583
00:49:30,061 --> 00:49:32,274
You don't want to listen to me,
do you Mr King?

584
00:49:32,207 --> 00:49:33,911
No, I don't. I've got other troubles.

585
00:49:35,133 --> 00:49:36,996
- Take him home, cabbie!
- Righto, Gov.

586
00:49:43,712 --> 00:49:45,127
Excuse me, Governor.

587
00:49:45,705 --> 00:49:49,554
Did the gentleman say that
the mummy's come back to life?

588
00:49:49,693 --> 00:49:51,180
He said it was possible.

589
00:49:51,842 --> 00:49:54,248
- You don't believe that, do you?
- Yes, I do.

590
00:49:54,363 --> 00:49:57,604
Some Egyptian gentlemen are
always up to some very funny tricks.

591
00:49:57,943 --> 00:50:02,883
A mummy brought back to life?
Say, that would really be something.

592
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:08,338
- Can I get you a cab, sir?
- No, I think I'll walk tonight.

593
00:50:09,582 --> 00:50:11,825
Your evening air is so healthy.

594
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:17,533
Oh... there you go.

595
00:50:17,622 --> 00:50:19,554
- God bless you, Governor.
- Good luck, Gov.

596
00:50:19,602 --> 00:50:21,138
- Thank you, Governor.
- Goodnight, Gov.

597
00:50:21,473 --> 00:50:24,162
- Half of that's mine, you know.
- I tell you what I'll do...

598
00:50:24,417 --> 00:50:26,630
All or nothing on
the next game of cards.

599
00:50:26,708 --> 00:50:30,132
Very fair. Very fair, indeed.

600
00:50:44,858 --> 00:50:46,637
You in a hurry, Gov?

601
00:50:46,813 --> 00:50:48,439
What can I do for you?

602
00:50:48,821 --> 00:50:52,810
Nothing, Dearie - I wondered if
there was anything I could do for you.

603
00:50:53,663 --> 00:50:59,024
Thanks, but no thanks.
Wait a minute.

604
00:51:00,175 --> 00:51:01,831
Get a good night's sleep.

605
00:51:03,091 --> 00:51:06,918
God bless you, sir.
You're a real gentleman.

606
00:51:16,426 --> 00:51:19,451
I don't know who the hell
you are, but don't joke about it.

607
00:51:52,055 --> 00:51:55,535
That old bitch in the attic, I've had no rent
off of her in a couple of weeks, neither.

608
00:51:55,635 --> 00:51:56,621
Maybe she's dead.

609
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:01,471
- Come on, you - finish some of that bread.
Give him one for me too, will ya?

610
00:52:01,273 --> 00:52:04,298
The spoiled brat don't know
when he's well off.

611
00:52:04,575 --> 00:52:07,399
Alright, alright - I'm coming!

612
00:52:09,124 --> 00:52:11,370
Here! Where do you think
you're going?! Albert?!

613
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:13,732
I believe you have a
foreign gentleman staying here.

614
00:52:13,779 --> 00:52:19,221
- And what business is it of yours?
- A Mr Bey - an Egyptian gentleman.

615
00:52:19,333 --> 00:52:22,506
Oh, yes. That'll be him
on the first floor back.

616
00:52:22,518 --> 00:52:23,660
Thank you, my good woman.

617
00:52:23,792 --> 00:52:25,549
Here - I never said you could
go up there though, did I?

618
00:52:25,597 --> 00:52:28,619
- How much did he give you?
- Keep your bleedin' hands off it!

619
00:52:28,798 --> 00:52:29,885
Be quiet, will you?

620
00:52:31,543 --> 00:52:33,367
- You saw him. You were there.
- Come on. Eat your bread.

621
00:52:33,381 --> 00:52:36,516
Hashmi! Open the door!

622
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:20,953
Have you found what you
are looking for, Mr Bray?

623
00:53:25,471 --> 00:53:29,455
- But your dinner will be ruined, sir.
- Alright woman, don't fuss.

624
00:53:29,465 --> 00:53:33,153
- And you haven't had a proper meal for days.
- I'll be in in a minute.

625
00:53:33,236 --> 00:53:35,505
- I'll pull the curtains.
- Leave them!

626
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,374
What the devil is that?

627
00:53:57,492 --> 00:54:03,959
Hieroglyphics on a medallion.
The Sacred Words.

628
00:54:05,774 --> 00:54:09,427
No, no, no. That can't be right.

629
00:54:37,082 --> 00:54:43,243
Great Scott.
The Sacred Words of Life.

630
00:55:59,428 --> 00:56:02,242
At last we understand
each other, Mr Bray.

631
00:56:02,441 --> 00:56:06,830
Then, if what you say is true,
who do you think is responsible?

632
00:56:09,747 --> 00:56:16,438
There are more forces at work. than even
your highly developed, scientific mind can grasp.

633
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,373
My dear Hashmi...

634
00:56:19,393 --> 00:56:22,566
...it was for that very reason
that I suspected you.

635
00:56:23,118 --> 00:56:24,199
Fool.

636
00:56:24,266 --> 00:56:27,618
If I posessed the secret
of reviving the dead,

637
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:31,579
do you think I would have
misused it in such a stupid way?

638
00:56:31,737 --> 00:56:33,649
No, perhaps not.

639
00:56:33,817 --> 00:56:36,101
Then, will you come
with me to the police?

640
00:56:36,847 --> 00:56:40,129
I shall be happy to
cooperate in any attempt

641
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:44,904
- to stop further, useless killing.
- Good - then let's go.

642
00:56:51,478 --> 00:56:55,376
"How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways. "

643
00:56:55,634 --> 00:57:00,615
"I love thee to the depth and
breadth and height my soul can reach"

644
00:57:00,662 --> 00:57:05,654
"when feeling out of sight for
the ends of Being and Ideal Grace. "

645
00:57:05,983 --> 00:57:10,687
"I love thee to the level of
everyday's most quiet need"

646
00:57:10,884 --> 00:57:13,886
"by sun and candlelight. "

647
00:57:14,293 --> 00:57:18,273
"I love thee freely,
as men strive for Right. "

648
00:57:18,337 --> 00:57:21,975
"I love thee purely,
as they turn from Praise. "

649
00:57:22,178 --> 00:57:26,979
"I love thee with a passion put
to use in my old griefs, and"

650
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:29,152
"with my childhood's faith. "

651
00:57:29,181 --> 00:57:34,343
"I love thee with a love I seemed
to lose with my lost saints. "

652
00:57:34,438 --> 00:57:40,674
"I love thee with the breath,
smiles, tears, of all my life. "

653
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:47,310
"And, if God chooses, I shall but
love thee better after death. "

654
00:57:51,388 --> 00:57:53,550
- Darling.
- Yes?

655
00:57:53,963 --> 00:57:56,834
- I have to leave London.
- Oh, no, Adam.

656
00:57:56,929 --> 00:57:59,047
I've made arrangements for
you and John to stay on.

657
00:57:59,151 --> 00:58:01,829
Without you? I couldn't bear it.

658
00:58:06,192 --> 00:58:09,377
I want you to come
with me. Will you?

659
00:58:09,829 --> 00:58:11,890
Yes, Adam. I will.

660
00:58:22,664 --> 00:58:25,241
- When do we leave?
- Tomorrow morning - early.

661
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:33,541
- So soon? How do I tell John?
- I suggest you leave him a note.

662
00:58:33,625 --> 00:58:37,350
I don't like to. But I suppose
it's the only way.

663
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:39,926
I'll go and do that now.

664
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:54,669
<i>Dear John -</i>

665
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:56,993
<i>I can only hope that you
will understand some small measure</i>

666
00:58:57,008 --> 00:58:59,055
<i>of my conflict, and someday
forgive me for my actions.</i>

667
01:01:46,742 --> 01:01:48,184
Darling, tell me what's happened.

668
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:51,584
Adam. Where is Adam?

669
01:01:56,114 --> 01:01:57,262
Is he alive?

670
01:01:57,353 --> 01:02:00,553
- Yes, Miss - he is alive.
- Oh, thank God.

671
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:04,527
- Can you tell me what happened, Miss?
- The mummy - it was here. It's alive!

672
01:02:04,627 --> 01:02:07,603
- You actually saw it?
- Yes. It attacked Adam!

673
01:02:07,702 --> 01:02:10,488
- It attacked Adam?
- Why should he do that?

674
01:02:10,542 --> 01:02:13,165
Then the theory we brought you,
Inspector, has been proved wrong.

675
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:15,533
That's often the trouble
with theories, sir.

676
01:02:15,603 --> 01:02:17,668
May I take Mr Beauchamp
to his room, sir?

677
01:02:17,728 --> 01:02:20,009
Yes. Sergeant, give him a hand.

678
01:02:23,063 --> 01:02:26,018
And yet, you know, it's
the only theory that works.

679
01:02:26,987 --> 01:02:32,166
Unless, of couse, it could be that
something else has gone wrong.

680
01:02:33,111 --> 01:02:35,488
Just could be.

681
01:02:39,917 --> 01:02:42,934
Look Inspector - will you give us another
chance to prove that we're right?

682
01:02:43,988 --> 01:02:47,595
There's one advantage the amateur
detective has over the professional...

683
01:02:47,654 --> 01:02:49,323
...a second chance.

684
01:02:58,379 --> 01:03:01,453
Adam, Darling! Are you alright?

685
01:03:07,389 --> 01:03:10,242
- Any luck?
- No good at all.

686
01:03:10,994 --> 01:03:13,351
- More brandy?
- Yes, please.

687
01:03:15,145 --> 01:03:18,689
Every solitary reference
to the curse agrees

688
01:03:18,702 --> 01:03:22,262
that only those directly involved
in the opening of the tomb

689
01:03:22,268 --> 01:03:23,504
are in mortal danger.

690
01:03:27,811 --> 01:03:31,267
- What was that?
- The curtains.

691
01:04:24,124 --> 01:04:25,934
Now!!

692
01:04:34,137 --> 01:04:36,816
Stop it! Stop it!

693
01:04:44,232 --> 01:04:48,753
Oh, Ra-Antef,
thou mighty Prince of Egypt,

694
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:51,780
son of the Pharaoh of Pharaohs,

695
01:04:52,838 --> 01:04:56,420
gaze down upon the humblest
of thy humble servants,

696
01:04:57,082 --> 01:05:01,594
who has transgressed against thee,
and heaped ridicule upon thy head,

697
01:05:01,661 --> 01:05:04,727
May the memory of my
ancestors be erased forever,

698
01:05:05,734 --> 01:05:10,831
and the memory of my unworthy self,
remain only in the minds of vermin,

699
01:05:10,966 --> 01:05:13,506
and the deceased creatures of the Earth.

700
01:05:13,871 --> 01:05:16,615
I, who have commited the unforgivable,

701
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:20,422
and allied myself with desecrators
and non-believers,

702
01:05:21,201 --> 01:05:24,005
emplore thee to destroy my body painfully,

703
01:05:26,111 --> 01:05:31,934
and my soul will pay penance,
through all eternity.

704
01:06:12,827 --> 01:06:14,203
Sergeant!

705
01:06:14,984 --> 01:06:17,056
See where he goes,
but keep your distance.

706
01:06:22,358 --> 01:06:24,663
- Find something to cover him up.
- Yes, sir.

707
01:06:25,246 --> 01:06:27,766
So, our theory was
proved right, Inspector.

708
01:06:27,909 --> 01:06:30,204
Yes, it was, sir. Thank heavens.

709
01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:33,254
The mummy only kills those
who disturb its peace.

710
01:06:33,285 --> 01:06:36,200
Then that leaves you and
Miss Dubois in danger.

711
01:06:37,046 --> 01:06:41,180
I still don't understand.
Why should the mummy attack you?

712
01:06:41,567 --> 01:06:44,349
It goes against all the known legends.

713
01:06:44,462 --> 01:06:49,536
I think I can answer that for you.
No. This way.

714
01:06:54,795 --> 01:06:56,283
This way, Darling.

715
01:07:45,611 --> 01:07:51,765
I can't believe it. Everything here
is in such perfect condition!

716
01:07:58,961 --> 01:08:03,570
And this - this is a Pharaoh's crown.

717
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:09,270
- That has always been mine.
- I don't understand.

718
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:22,925
Sweet Annette, there is much I would have
to tell you before you could understand.

719
01:08:26,567 --> 01:08:33,975
Think back first to the legend of Ra.
There are facts you could not not know.

720
01:08:39,251 --> 01:08:44,128
When Ramses heard the news of the death
of his favorite son, he suffered a stroke

721
01:08:44,272 --> 01:08:46,368
which was finally to kill him.

722
01:08:47,026 --> 01:08:48,870
On his death bed,
he sent for the person

723
01:08:48,953 --> 01:08:52,022
who had been truly responsible
for both of these happenings

724
01:08:53,108 --> 01:09:00,240
and he cursed that person.
cursed him to everlasting life,

725
01:09:01,249 --> 01:09:03,756
unless he could die by
the hand of his own brother.

726
01:09:04,562 --> 01:09:08,200
- How would you know that?
- Because I am that person!

727
01:09:08,484 --> 01:09:13,897
Be - youngest son of Ramses VIII,
Pharaoh of Pharaohs.

728
01:09:14,059 --> 01:09:18,568
Cursed to eternal wandering.
For I could never die!

729
01:09:19,125 --> 01:09:21,500
The only person that could
release me from the curse

730
01:09:21,587 --> 01:09:24,819
had already been rendered useless
by the hands of my own assassins...

731
01:09:26,213 --> 01:09:31,046
...until now.
Now I can die.

732
01:09:31,445 --> 01:09:33,260
When your father found
the tomb of my brother

733
01:09:33,262 --> 01:09:35,504
he provided the means,
but it was lifeless.

734
01:09:35,803 --> 01:09:37,749
When you gave us the medallion,

735
01:09:37,904 --> 01:09:40,977
you provided the words
that would revive it.

736
01:09:45,754 --> 01:09:50,524
While the hand of my brother lives,
I must use it.

737
01:09:51,592 --> 01:09:57,229
So, you see, Annette,
we will be together, as I wanted.

738
01:09:58,519 --> 01:10:03,370
Now, repeat after me:

739
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:13,760
Awaken, O Silent One,
thou who has slept.

740
01:10:14,889 --> 01:10:15,932
Say it!!

741
01:10:16,609 --> 01:10:20,542
Awaken, O Silent One,
thou who has slept.

742
01:10:20,607 --> 01:10:27,125
Appear. Thou are justified against
those who sought to harm you.

743
01:10:27,214 --> 01:10:30,756
Appear. Thou are justified
against those...

744
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:45,591
Osiris, father of all, give this, thy servant
that which you bestow upon

745
01:10:45,664 --> 01:10:47,307
the unborn bird in the egg.

746
01:10:47,547 --> 01:10:50,397
Give it the breath of life!

747
01:10:51,286 --> 01:10:54,095
Set the time that it may come forth,

748
01:10:54,158 --> 01:10:56,876
and loudly raise up its voice
to praise thee.

749
01:10:57,291 --> 01:11:00,047
Awake, O Ra, my brother.

750
01:11:00,802 --> 01:11:04,695
Awake, Ra, son of
the Pharaoh of Pharaohs.

751
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:10,708
Awake, Ra - Prince of the Desert.

752
01:11:22,279 --> 01:11:23,776
Welcome, my brother.

753
01:11:26,301 --> 01:11:29,241
The time is now at hand for you
to complete your earthly mission

754
01:11:29,296 --> 01:11:31,989
that you may rest in peace again
for all eternity.

755
01:11:32,014 --> 01:11:35,808
First - destroy the last
of the desecrators!

756
01:11:37,631 --> 01:11:40,468
Adam! Stop him! You're mad!

757
01:11:44,157 --> 01:11:49,226
Ra, your work must not be
defiled by the presence of others.

758
01:11:56,559 --> 01:11:59,653
John! John, help me!
John!

759
01:12:10,312 --> 01:12:11,382
Adam!

760
01:12:22,394 --> 01:12:24,217
- Where does it lead to?!
- Under the main road, sir.

761
01:12:24,225 --> 01:12:25,941
- For God's sake, do something!
- Alright, come on!

762
01:12:56,537 --> 01:12:57,912
There.

763
01:13:09,298 --> 01:13:11,546
Stop him, Adam! Stop him, please!

764
01:13:11,628 --> 01:13:13,883
My Darling, don't be
frightened of death.

765
01:13:13,924 --> 01:13:17,981
Welcome it as a release from the
torture and torment of this cold life!

766
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:19,886
Oh, I want to live!

767
01:13:19,933 --> 01:13:22,218
That is nothing compared to
the pain that I have seen

768
01:13:22,242 --> 01:13:25,893
wandering this Earth
for 3,000 years!

769
01:13:25,977 --> 01:13:32,511
Plagues, famine, pestilence, wars, and
Man's daily inhumanity to his fellow men!

770
01:13:32,561 --> 01:13:37,654
That is more cruel - more painful
than this mangled stump!

771
01:13:38,763 --> 01:13:42,485
Life without end is the only pain
I can no longer bear.

772
01:13:44,313 --> 01:13:46,207
Now, Ra, now.

773
01:14:03,132 --> 01:14:04,722
Kill her!

774
01:14:05,832 --> 01:14:07,123
Kill her!

775
01:14:11,589 --> 01:14:14,969
My aesthetic, beauty loving brother!

776
01:15:55,972 --> 01:15:58,540
<i>There she is! I can't
see anyone else!</i>

777
01:15:58,569 --> 01:16:00,580
<i>Annette! Annette!</i>

778
01:16:14,755 --> 01:16:18,908
<i>Right, lower the rope, Inspector!
I'll go down!</i>

779
01:16:27,922 --> 01:16:32,668
<i>Rest, my Father. Rest.</i>
