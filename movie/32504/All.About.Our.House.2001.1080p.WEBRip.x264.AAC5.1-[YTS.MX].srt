00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:09,127
Excuse me, let me through.

11
00:01:10,636 --> 00:01:11,800
Everything's OK, it's OK.

12
00:01:13,272 --> 00:01:14,831
No pets allowed here.

13
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:16,047
You have it all wrong.

14
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,273
No more excuses.

15
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:20,070
You were walking a really huge one!

16
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:22,872
Don't be ridiculous.

17
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:25,645
A giant lizard with a huge tail...

18
00:01:25,818 --> 00:01:27,343
bit the people in #301.

19
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,051
Don't ask me!

20
00:01:29,288 --> 00:01:31,154
- It's a public nuisance.
- Go away!

21
00:01:33,268 --> 00:01:34,402
- Stop it!
- Let me look!

22
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,473
I'll sue you!

23
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,731
Oh, look, it's a lizard!

24
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,795
That's my wife, my wife!

25
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:42,666
Stop it!

26
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,168
Don't! She hates flashes!

27
00:01:44,837 --> 00:01:46,100
Don't!

28
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,009
Yes, yes.

29
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,908
Are you going or not?

30
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,173
Five more minutes.

31
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:00,813
It'll get dark.

32
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:01,786
Right, right.

33
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:17,431
Hello, it's Naosuke.

34
00:02:18,437 --> 00:02:22,340
I really don't know about Godzilla,
it's just too far out.

35
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,806
We did all that monster stuff
to death before.

36
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:30,083
Just changing Godzilla
to Mechagodzilla...

37
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:32,716
doesn't change
the fundamental problem.

38
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,221
Oh, I'm sorry, I'll call you back.

39
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:39,351
Sorry, sorry.

40
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:49,093
Hey, what's that?

41
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,105
What is this?

42
00:02:54,473 --> 00:02:55,463
It's a well.

43
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:09,353
The supermarket's behind the forest,
there's a school over there.

44
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,488
And a police box nearby
so it's safe at night.

45
00:03:14,493 --> 00:03:15,859
So what do you think?

46
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,489
We're going to live here forever.

47
00:03:19,398 --> 00:03:23,392
That's right, until we're
grandma and grandpa together.

48
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:25,999
What shall we build...

49
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,772
Something stylish.

50
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,342
Yeah.

51
00:03:36,972 --> 00:03:41,887
ALL ABOUT OUR HOUSE

52
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:45,924
Plans are Everything

53
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:50,124
I think we ought to move away
from the monster motif.

54
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:57,535
No, no, not that.
Right, right, right...

55
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,363
Right. Right.

56
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:06,802
Sorry, sorry.

57
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:10,548
Now, what about the plans?

58
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:11,764
An architect?

59
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:15,015
What if we get someone
with terrible taste?

60
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:16,406
- A house is forever.
- That's right.

61
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:19,120
- Your father?
- Him? He's just a contractor.

62
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,082
He can't draw plans?

63
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,525
I don't think so.
A contractor's not an architect.

64
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,298
But he might know someone who can.

65
00:04:25,894 --> 00:04:26,910
Excuse me.

66
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:28,543
Coffee.

67
00:04:29,468 --> 00:04:31,960
He pals around with old guys.

68
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:35,064
Who knows what that bunch of
geezers would build.

69
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:36,875
Your Dad would love it.

70
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,107
We're not doing this
to make him happy.

71
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:44,549
Remember Yanagisawa,
the interior designer?

72
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,315
He created that table for us.

73
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:48,281
Huh?

74
00:04:48,711 --> 00:04:49,829
How about him?

75
00:04:49,995 --> 00:04:50,940
For what?

76
00:04:51,253 --> 00:04:54,781
For our house plans.
C'mon, pay attention.

77
00:04:55,394 --> 00:04:56,384
What?

78
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,834
His main thing is furniture but
he does interiors, too.

79
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:03,234
Really?

80
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:07,362
We could ask a regular architect,
but it might turn out stuffy.

81
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,873
Yanagisawa can give us
a contemporary feel.

82
00:05:12,454 --> 00:05:13,478
That sounds good.

83
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,211
- Are you serious?
- Yes I am.

84
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,079
Your work's important,
but it's our house!

85
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,247
I think he'd be great,
let's hire Yanagisawa...

86
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,354
I mean, who else can handle it?

87
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,194
A Martian, yes, just go for it.

88
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:36,194
Bring in a Martian at the end.

89
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:42,639
What, you serious?
Yeah, yeah, yes...

90
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:47,641
Hello.

91
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,405
It's been awhile.

92
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,542
You look the same. Any children?

93
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,881
Not yet. I know you're busy.

94
00:05:55,287 --> 00:05:56,380
Don't mention it.

95
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,591
For real?

96
00:05:59,191 --> 00:06:02,923
I'm just on my way out.
A place I designed opens tomorrow.

97
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:03,993
Oh my.

98
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,626
Why don't you join me?

99
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,705
Why sure.

100
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:10,101
You sure I'm right for it?

101
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:12,862
Oh, yes, we want you.

102
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:15,165
But I've only done interiors.

103
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,477
We just know
you'll do a great job, right?

104
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:22,377
You know, I've always wanted
to design a house.

105
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,645
Really? So it's perfect, then.

106
00:06:28,487 --> 00:06:30,285
You look awfully pale. Are you OK?

107
00:06:30,904 --> 00:06:32,005
Are you sick?

108
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,436
I'm just...

109
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,013
You're carsick?

110
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,196
We're almost there.

111
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,674
- Here.
- Thanks.

112
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,301
Am I a wild driver?

113
00:06:51,343 --> 00:06:54,370
It's not that.
I didn't get much sleep last night.

114
00:06:58,318 --> 00:06:59,146
So?

115
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:04,088
You'll design us a special house,
something unconventional.

116
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:07,352
I mean, this place is great.

117
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,220
It's so cool.

118
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:12,627
My theme was the fusion of
tradition and modernism.

119
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,726
I tried to make it authentic.

120
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,531
Now I really want to do...

121
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:22,540
something based on
mid-century Modernism,

122
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,510
architecture of the '50s and '60s.

123
00:07:25,177 --> 00:07:28,341
I'm most inspired by
Rudolf Schindler's Americanism.

124
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:32,718
But for the right fee,
I'd design anything, even this place.

125
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,136
Excuse me.

126
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:37,848
What do you think?

127
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,750
For a hot designer,
he's not that pretentious.

128
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,519
Don't have a clue
what he means, but...

129
00:07:44,396 --> 00:07:45,694
I think he'll be fine.

130
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:48,995
No!

131
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,228
Why can't you do it like I said!

132
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:55,767
The intervals have to be equal!

133
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:59,310
This is just one big mess!

134
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,564
Do it over.

135
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,642
Tomorrow's the opening, you idiot!

136
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:11,351
I'd love to take the job.

137
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,022
There's just one problem.

138
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:20,263
I'm not a licensed architect,
so I can't apply for city permits.

139
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:21,559
You need a license?

140
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:26,499
Yeah, what if I design it, but
someone else draws up the final plans?

141
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,571
That much my father can handle.
He's licensed, after all.

142
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,440
That's right,
your father's a contractor.

143
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:34,858
Would you ask him?

144
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:42,284
Hello.

145
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:48,385
Oh, so you found it.
Why that's wonderful.

146
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,194
The thing is,

147
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:54,198
what would you think
if we asked Dad to build it?

148
00:08:57,202 --> 00:08:59,228
He's an old man, now.
Is he still up to it?

149
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:04,408
I've heard his work is still meticulous.
I'm sure he'd be delighted.

150
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,773
Hold on a minute,
he's cutting his toenails.

151
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,344
It's Tamiko, your daughter, dear.

152
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:11,580
They found their land.

153
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,348
She wants to ask you a favor.

154
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:20,550
So the deal is, we're having
someone else draw up the plans.

155
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,320
But we want you to get
the permits and build it.

156
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,168
Sure.

157
00:09:31,136 --> 00:09:33,731
Are you sure?
And build the house, too?

158
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,807
Someone else is drawing up the plans.

159
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,472
I'm not sure he gets it.

160
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,545
Yes. Good night then.

161
00:09:50,182 --> 00:09:51,284
Did you accept?

162
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:55,820
How would I know?
Whether or not I'm doing it...

163
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,331
You'll be getting busier.

164
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:32,161
It's due at the end of the month.

165
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:33,623
The Martians OK?

166
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,598
How's your house? You find land?

167
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:38,293
It's in the country.

168
00:10:38,737 --> 00:10:40,399
What do you want for a house-warming?

169
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:41,337
Thank you.

170
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,306
Call the maestro a taxi.

171
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:48,644
The plans?

172
00:10:49,214 --> 00:10:53,413
I already told you,
we've hired a designer, Yanagisawa.

173
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:54,422
Who's that?

174
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,249
I knew him in college.

175
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,521
You'd trust a kid like that?

176
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,358
He's an interior designer now.

177
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,393
Specializes in Modernism.

178
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,490
Never heard of it.

179
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:05,858
Mid-century at that, Father.

180
00:11:06,598 --> 00:11:07,622
Mid-sentence?

181
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,525
Are you up to this?

182
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:10,665
To what?

183
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:14,205
You actually have to talk to him.
He's a modernist, you know.

184
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,674
The hell with modernism.

185
00:11:16,975 --> 00:11:19,467
Thing about a house is,
it's got to be sturdy...

186
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:21,946
Isn't that right, Naosuke?

187
00:11:22,514 --> 00:11:23,709
Yes.

188
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:30,384
Wow, design a house!

189
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,323
Yeah, however I want.

190
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,988
Finally, your dream come true.

191
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:38,464
Wonderful.

192
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,226
Come let me show you.

193
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:41,194
What?

194
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,000
Thank you.

195
00:11:42,086 --> 00:11:43,920
What, what?

196
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:49,631
And the Japanese style room?
That's what I'm worried about.

197
00:11:50,382 --> 00:11:51,102
What do you say?

198
00:11:51,191 --> 00:11:54,524
I think we can skip it.
We'd never use it anyway.

199
00:11:58,016 --> 00:11:59,382
Do you think we need one?

200
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:04,689
But when you get older,
you'll really wish you had one.

201
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,623
Of course.

202
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:09,556
Instead of a Japanese room,
make a bigger living room.

203
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,860
What do you know, you brat.

204
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:15,528
Would you like some more potatoes?

205
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:16,734
Yes, I would.

206
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,332
When will the plans be ready?

207
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,932
Yanagisawa's thinking about them now.

208
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,536
What's your schedule?

209
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:32,782
Me? I don't really
have a definite schedule.

210
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:36,515
Get me the plans, the plans.

211
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,551
In any case, Naosuke.
I'm excited about it.

212
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,431
You think he's up to it?

213
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,369
He's certainly gung ho.

214
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,663
I'm really worried.

215
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:57,502
I think he was overjoyed
when you called to ask.

216
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:01,944
He started calling around
right afterwards.

217
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:03,445
Around?

218
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:04,873
His old crew.

219
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:09,720
Recently he's been sub-contracting
for sub-contractors.

220
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,378
Finally, he's got a job
he can sink his teeth into.

221
00:13:12,538 --> 00:13:13,749
...makes a world of difference.

222
00:13:18,897 --> 00:13:20,331
I see your point.

223
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,900
The thing about that place...

224
00:13:23,138 --> 00:13:24,224
What about it?

225
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:26,933
Nothing blocks the wind.
It'll blow right at you.

226
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:29,440
Gotta build it to stand up to it.

227
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:30,708
I understand.

228
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,039
Since when are you the expert?

229
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,383
I already checked it out.
Got a problem?

230
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:40,511
You already went?

231
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:41,783
He's pretty into it.

232
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,115
Listen up, guys.

233
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:44,920
Yes.

234
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:48,892
Don't mess with that wind.

235
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:50,888
That wind.

236
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,450
Tamiko, Tamiko.

237
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:26,897
About that Japanese room,
your father's dead set on it.

238
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,465
What with the craze for
Western houses,

239
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:34,904
he hasn't had a crack at a real
Japanese room for some time.

240
00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:36,045
Sounds good to me.

241
00:14:36,088 --> 00:14:37,952
There you go, caving in again.

242
00:14:38,977 --> 00:14:41,742
For years and years,
he's followed customers' orders.

243
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,514
Who knows how many years
he's got left.

244
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,951
Just this once,
can't you let him do as he pleases?

245
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,883
I can relate.

246
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,386
He's got something in mind
for that Japanese room.

247
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:54,619
Let's talk to Yanagisawa.

248
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,924
- Put it on hold.
- Think about it?

249
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,425
Why can't Dad tell us himself?

250
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:01,661
You know how he is.
See you.

251
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:03,895
- Good night.
- 'Night.

252
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,535
Let's let him build one.

253
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,539
For your Dad.

254
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,442
You sure have a soft spot
for him, don't you?

255
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,641
I love that old time craftsmanship.

256
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:19,845
Let's do it for him...

257
00:15:31,596 --> 00:15:32,996
Don't be ridiculous.

258
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:37,229
Something with a razor sharp head
just attacked the people in #401.

259
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,058
Don't ask me!

260
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,131
- This is a public nuisance.
- Go away!

261
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,202
- Stop it!
- Let me look!

262
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:45,750
I'll sue you!

263
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:49,181
I see something!
Oh, look, it's a Martian!

264
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,678
That's my wife, my wife!

265
00:15:53,002 --> 00:15:53,929
Stop it!

266
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:57,249
Don't! She hates flashes!

267
00:16:07,265 --> 00:16:12,033
A big roof makes big snow drifts
- Afghani proverb

268
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,268
- Hear about the Japanese room?
- Yeah.

269
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,599
- Forget it if it's too much.
- Not a problem.

270
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:46,499
But...

271
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:50,770
But that's really not my domain,
so why not leave it to him?

272
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:52,506
Thanks for understanding.

273
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:56,205
I wanted you to get an idea,
so I came up with this.

274
00:17:00,218 --> 00:17:01,283
Just an idea.

275
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:04,399
If you like it, I'll draw up plans.

276
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,593
Wow!

277
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,581
The basic concept is:
The Simpler The Better.

278
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,822
I went for perpendicular angles.

279
00:17:13,614 --> 00:17:14,604
Let's go inside.

280
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:15,530
We can?

281
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,728
Not really.
It's just a general idea.

282
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:19,455
This is the entrance.

283
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:22,739
I want the living room to be open.

284
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:26,176
In contrast to the exterior,
the 1st floor's all about horizontal.

285
00:17:27,345 --> 00:17:30,338
No unnecessary vertical lines,
in the Schindler Frame style.

286
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:33,212
As for wall colors, see this window?

287
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:34,114
Yes.

288
00:17:34,786 --> 00:17:38,348
It maximizes both natural sunlight
and resultant shadows.

289
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,754
I want to draw out the inherent
texture of the materials.

290
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,761
What's called "soft monotone."

291
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:47,828
Steven Hall adapted
this approach from Schindler.

292
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,827
Onto the 2nd floor.

293
00:17:51,736 --> 00:17:55,298
Haven't seen you since we built
that professor's mansion together.

294
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,098
That's right.

295
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,007
That was one sturdy house.

296
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,013
Put a lot of time and effort
into that one.

297
00:18:03,281 --> 00:18:06,979
Who makes your hearing aid?

298
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:11,085
We built a professor's house?

299
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:13,787
You were out with a diabetes attack.

300
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:16,828
Who did the paint finishes?

301
00:18:17,762 --> 00:18:18,855
It was Mori.

302
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:23,599
Oh, I remember Mori.

303
00:18:23,835 --> 00:18:25,098
What's he up to now?

304
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:28,172
Died last year. His lungs...

305
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,902
Hey, who makes your hearing aid?

306
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:32,806
They're dying like flies.

307
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,912
Didn't Mori run the marathon?

308
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:37,041
That was old Kurosawa.

309
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,882
The old man, huh.
Brings back memories.

310
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:44,255
He died last month.
His lymph nodes...

311
00:18:45,223 --> 00:18:47,385
The old man died?

312
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:54,098
I'm so happy to be working
with you again, chief.

313
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,226
I'm serious.

314
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,268
Me too, back with the old gang.

315
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,999
Makes it worth still being alive
all these years.

316
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:07,071
Hey, does your hearing aid work?
C'mon, man...

317
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:12,047
Listen guys, my heart actually
stopped beating last year.

318
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:13,552
I'm officially disabled.

319
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:20,384
Yanagisawa called to say he's late.
The traffic's really bad.

320
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,224
- Please.
- Thank you.

321
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,065
Suga will apply for the permits.

322
00:19:27,714 --> 00:19:28,710
Not you, Dad?

323
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:33,236
I've got a second class license,
so I can't get any permits.

324
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,165
Suga's is first class.

325
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,434
Very nice to meet you.

326
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:39,307
I hope I can be of help.

327
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,347
His father's an architect, too.

328
00:19:45,116 --> 00:19:45,913
I see.

329
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:49,387
My son-in-law writes TV scripts.

330
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,212
I see.

331
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,586
His scripts have a satirical touch.
Wonderful stuff.

332
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,728
Watch your sugar intake, Dad.

333
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,991
I'm fine.
Workmen need their energy.

334
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,263
- Yanagisawa!
- I'll get it.

335
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:11,841
Oh, chief,
have a look at our last job.

336
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:17,146
Great house.
It looks really sturdy.

337
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,943
These new houses are no good.

338
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,187
They only care how it looks.

339
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,515
Yanagisawa.

340
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,621
Sorry to be late.

341
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:31,219
May I introduce Yanagisawa,
he's designing the house.

342
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:33,089
My father.

343
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:35,845
I'm Iwata.

344
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,731
I'm Yanagisawa.

345
00:20:39,971 --> 00:20:41,132
This is the architect.

346
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,764
I'm with Suga Architects.

347
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:45,774
He's handling the permits.

348
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,810
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

349
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:49,570
Are they ready?

350
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,885
Let's sit here. Dad, take a seat.

351
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,182
Well, this is the general idea
I'm working with.

352
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:04,287
Such details...

353
00:21:04,462 --> 00:21:05,361
Wonderful.

354
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,467
There may be some adjustments,
of course.

355
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:22,078
You drew these?

356
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,177
Yes.

357
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,216
Just what you'd expect...

358
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,888
from an Art school graduate.

359
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,373
What do you think?

360
00:21:34,055 --> 00:21:35,104
It won't work.

361
00:21:36,933 --> 00:21:37,956
What's the...

362
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,491
It violates construction code.

363
00:21:41,027 --> 00:21:42,119
Violates code?

364
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,503
Your land is zoned exclusively
for Class 1 homes.

365
00:21:46,971 --> 00:21:49,531
You can't just go and build
to any height you please.

366
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,810
You'll never get a permit for this.

367
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:56,913
What if we ignore that?

368
00:21:57,929 --> 00:21:59,299
They'll tear it down.

369
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,050
I'm sorry, but...

370
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:15,297
You'll have to start over again.

371
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,239
This is giving me a headache.

372
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,401
Don't worry about me.

373
00:22:24,175 --> 00:22:26,644
As long as I get a bigger study,
I'm fine.

374
00:22:45,563 --> 00:22:48,192
Those plans are hopeless.
They'll never work.

375
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,430
Why are you so negative?

376
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,599
Yanagisawa said he'll rethink them.

377
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:57,673
What are you gonna do?
Suga's in a real bind, here.

378
00:22:58,343 --> 00:22:59,436
Suga, talk to her?

379
00:22:59,677 --> 00:23:01,145
Oh, no thank you.

380
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:08,153
We've already hired him.

381
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:13,581
We've made our decision.
Can't you try to be more patient?

382
00:23:16,494 --> 00:23:18,986
In any case, these are useless.

383
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,631
Just in case, you draw up some plans.

384
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,366
But what about your daughter?

385
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:30,441
If it comes to that,
I'll talk to her.

386
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,944
I'll do my best.

387
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,445
You live in a house for decades.

388
00:23:38,616 --> 00:23:40,414
You can't just throw it together.

389
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:49,190
Come in.

390
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:52,494
Thanks for coming over.

391
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:55,326
My wife wanted to join us
but she's got school now.

392
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,992
Unfortunately,
I'm on my way out, too.

393
00:23:58,762 --> 00:23:59,923
I won't be long.

394
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,271
We can leave together in 5 minutes.

395
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:04,676
Come on in.

396
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:07,741
Hey, rise and shine.

397
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,653
Take a seat.

398
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:21,691
About yesterday,
I just hadn't done my homework.

399
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,052
Well, neither had we.

400
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:27,459
I need 3 days to draw up new plans.

401
00:24:28,198 --> 00:24:29,212
That'll be great.

402
00:24:40,778 --> 00:24:44,237
Say, you write that TV series
"Nutty Apartments?"

403
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:45,246
Well, yes.

404
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,145
Where do you get those ideas?

405
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:50,244
You could say I eke them out
of myself by sheer force.

406
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:52,047
That's hard work, every week.

407
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:53,388
It is.

408
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:58,428
Yanagisawa, hurry.

409
00:24:59,163 --> 00:24:59,789
What?

410
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:02,164
She's about to roll...

411
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:09,063
You can't expose yourself like that
in front of a guest!

412
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:10,567
Hurry up and turn over!

413
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:11,470
Hurry!

414
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:13,570
Turn over!

415
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,015
I just restored this.

416
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:20,784
I'm on my way to deliver it now.
Can I give you a lift?

417
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:32,588
Sorry, be right back.

418
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,754
Go right ahead.

419
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:37,466
There you go.

420
00:25:38,073 --> 00:25:39,373
Any problems since then?

421
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,764
The cabinet windows are
a little heavy.

422
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:47,244
That glass is kind of thick.
It's got its own charm, but...

423
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,780
I'll take a look. We can change it.

424
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:53,484
I think you should wear
that apron a little lower.

425
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:55,320
Oh.

426
00:25:58,514 --> 00:25:59,413
This place too?

427
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:01,857
I know the manager,
so I just lent a hand.

428
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:04,529
It's great.

429
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:06,690
Sorry, call waiting.

430
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,497
I found this table in New York.

431
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:14,134
Really? It's got real heft.

432
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,634
How would I know? Find it yourself.

433
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,504
Are you the president?

434
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:22,874
I guess I am.

435
00:26:23,247 --> 00:26:24,715
But you're so young.

436
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,818
I quit my former job and
started it with friends.

437
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:30,685
It's just me now. Excuse me.

438
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:34,549
Just go buy it, go for it.

439
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:38,494
Wait a sec. What?

440
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:40,156
Go outside, you're making a racket.

441
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:43,131
Hang up.

442
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:45,301
Gotta call you back.

443
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:46,200
Now!

444
00:26:48,339 --> 00:26:49,898
Go gossip at Starbucks.

445
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:54,170
This place is all about atmosphere.
That's the whole concept.

446
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:59,607
I've never actually
worked for a company.

447
00:27:00,918 --> 00:27:02,181
After college...

448
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:06,187
He told me to go
"gossip at Starbucks."

449
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:19,303
Which of you assholes
picked on my girl?

450
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:26,234
Use the phone outside.

451
00:27:27,988 --> 00:27:29,123
Who the hell are you?

452
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,378
You don't belong here.

453
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:00,544
Oh, we'll pay their check.

454
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,127
Thank you.

455
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:12,588
Excuse me.

456
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:30,605
He says he'll finish the new plans
by Friday, so let's just wait.

457
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:32,771
I'm hungry.

458
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,310
Right up. Sukiyaki OK?
We have that nice beef.

459
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:36,947
Great.

460
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:39,008
Yanagisawa wasn't down?

461
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:40,577
Didn't seem like it.

462
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:43,287
Oh, good.
You stay on top of it, OK?

463
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:45,586
We can leave the rest up to them.

464
00:28:47,925 --> 00:28:49,326
Aren't you worried?

465
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:52,764
Sure, but I've got
my own work to do.

466
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:55,831
Doesn't it matter to you?

467
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,263
That's not fair.

468
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:58,366
Whatever.

469
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:00,535
I'm doing my best...

470
00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:04,371
This solves the permit problem.

471
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,477
It's looking good, isn't it?

472
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:09,475
You can see it
from different angles.

473
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:12,349
Looking good, looking good.

474
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:13,878
And your wife?

475
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:15,411
She's put me in charge.

476
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:17,418
Father?

477
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:19,600
Got a pen?

478
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:21,625
Yes, here.

479
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:23,085
What do you say?

480
00:29:23,494 --> 00:29:24,898
Hey, wait, what are you doing?

481
00:29:25,089 --> 00:29:27,498
- Central pillar.
- You don't need a pillar there!

482
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,698
What's a house
without a central pillar.

483
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,838
You need to rethink your ideas.

484
00:29:34,872 --> 00:29:36,272
Central pillar?

485
00:29:36,974 --> 00:29:39,842
Hey, what have we here?

486
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:40,840
What?

487
00:29:41,511 --> 00:29:42,498
Look at this.

488
00:29:43,714 --> 00:29:46,309
This way, the main door opens in.

489
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:49,685
You're right.
Good thing you caught it.

490
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,447
What a joke.

491
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:53,448
It's supposed to open in.

492
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:56,019
What... did you just say?

493
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,726
I want it to open in.

494
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:00,588
Hear that, Suga?

495
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:02,930
What, is it a huge problem?

496
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:08,029
I've never heard
of a door that opens in.

497
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,607
Most American houses...

498
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:13,434
Where the hell are we!
I thought this was Japan!

499
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:15,102
My inspiration is Americanism.

500
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:19,507
Then get yourself an American
contractor! I'm not up to it.

501
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:21,397
Father.

502
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:25,582
Naosuke.

503
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:29,517
Sorry but I just quit.

504
00:30:29,927 --> 00:30:31,327
Please, wait.

505
00:30:31,562 --> 00:30:35,522
I sympathize, but Western houses
are built on bigger lots.

506
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:36,462
Let me...

507
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:40,595
Japanese building is all about
how to maximize limited space.

508
00:30:40,938 --> 00:30:42,998
And so our doors open OUT.

509
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:46,743
But take another look, Suga san.
I've added

510
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:50,445
extra space in the front hall
for just that reason.

511
00:30:50,886 --> 00:30:52,050
Oh, I see your point.

512
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:53,308
Take a closer look.

513
00:31:05,546 --> 00:31:06,673
Never seen such a thing.

514
00:31:11,063 --> 00:31:12,436
I know, I know.

515
00:31:13,971 --> 00:31:16,998
What if it swung both ways,
like a Western saloon?

516
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:18,406
That's not the point.

517
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:21,472
I've never seen one like it!

518
00:31:26,717 --> 00:31:27,980
Oh, man.

519
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,124
It's really complicated, isn't it?
Building a house.

520
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:36,620
Maybe we should've just bought one.

521
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,520
Just kidding.

522
00:31:40,097 --> 00:31:42,965
The chief's so serious,
he doesn't get my jokes.

523
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:45,427
- Naosuke.
- Yes, Father.

524
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,194
This maestro here.

525
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:51,706
Hasn't really been on
many construction sites, has he?

526
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:55,444
It's the first time
he's designed a house.

527
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:56,945
My specialty is furniture.

528
00:31:57,014 --> 00:31:58,710
I don't care what
your damn specialty is.

529
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,512
You gotta know the nuts and bolts.

530
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,224
What a waste of time.

531
00:32:06,757 --> 00:32:08,988
Excuse me, but I've got experience.

532
00:32:09,593 --> 00:32:10,428
You do?

533
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:12,280
Part-time construction work
in the U.S.

534
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:13,954
Part-time...

535
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:21,562
Chief, you should learn more
about architectural styles.

536
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,905
Your way isn't necessarily
the only way.

537
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:31,648
Father, watch your salt intake.

538
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,584
Don't worry, Naosuke.

539
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,179
Workmen on construction sites sweat!

540
00:32:57,541 --> 00:32:58,702
The way I see it,

541
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:04,011
Dad's only ever built houses
the old-fashioned way, so he's lost.

542
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:06,275
That chief...

543
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:10,918
But we want you to design
the house your way.

544
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:13,223
So you just go right ahead.

545
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,217
Right ahead.

546
00:33:16,827 --> 00:33:19,228
And what about the door, then?

547
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:27,764
The truth is, it doesn't matter...

548
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:32,076
which way the door opens.

549
00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:34,710
Well, if that's how you feel...

550
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:36,708
That's not what I...

551
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:41,278
Can't you save his pride?

552
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,922
Have it open out?

553
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:49,555
Well, I guess.

554
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:52,127
I'm sorry.

555
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:54,925
I don't...

556
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:58,595
Actually, Dad used to
do interiors, too.

557
00:33:59,136 --> 00:34:00,035
I see.

558
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:02,670
Sorry...

559
00:34:02,973 --> 00:34:04,805
Not design, but finish work.

560
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:09,336
Actually, the two of you
have a lot in common.

561
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:19,852
This is it, this is it.

562
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:22,626
This is the house I wanted to build.

563
00:34:24,261 --> 00:34:26,093
Oh, don't trouble yourself.

564
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:29,766
Now these are what
I call professional drawings.

565
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:30,959
Much obliged.

566
00:34:31,802 --> 00:34:34,863
This curving veranda.
Has that storybook feel.

567
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:39,339
I had to consider that
it's a home for a young couple.

568
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:43,005
I'll talk to Tamiko about it.

569
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:47,849
Your third house is the perfect one
- ancient Japanese proverb

570
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:55,986
So you found a great property.

571
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,154
- Thanks to you, Mother.
- Not at all.

572
00:34:58,329 --> 00:34:59,024
Why?

573
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:02,123
Mother told us the feng-shui
on the property was good.

574
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:05,392
That land lies directly
south-southeast of here.

575
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:10,170
If you move south-southeast
by next year, you'll have great luck.

576
00:35:10,841 --> 00:35:11,865
Show me the plans.

577
00:35:12,264 --> 00:35:13,452
They're not final yet.

578
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,336
The front door can't face east.

579
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,379
Really?

580
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,369
Or your husband will
stop coming home.

581
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:21,434
Which way's east?

582
00:35:22,194 --> 00:35:23,165
This way.

583
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,756
Fine, it's facing south.

584
00:35:25,856 --> 00:35:26,880
Oh, good.

585
00:35:27,691 --> 00:35:28,954
What's this, the study?

586
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:34,327
The study, the master's room,
should face northwest.

587
00:35:34,702 --> 00:35:35,622
What'll we do?

588
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:37,793
That's enough. Go home.

589
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,895
But you're older than my son,
so maybe...

590
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:45,435
But really, his study should
be closer to the living room.

591
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:49,407
He's tends to brood,
so it's bad for him to be isolated.

592
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,075
Should've said so sooner.

593
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:52,444
Should've shown me sooner.

594
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,910
I'll speak to my father about it.

595
00:35:56,253 --> 00:35:58,449
It's just an idea.
It's not such a big deal.

596
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,953
The thing is,
you build the house your way.

597
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,985
Our ancestors gave us feng-shui.

598
00:36:05,262 --> 00:36:10,132
But take the advice you like
and then do what you want.

599
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:11,443
Sure.

600
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:15,968
But, since you're building,
might as well as make it auspicious.

601
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,136
Does the kitchen face south?

602
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:21,407
Great, you've thought it out.

603
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,071
And the bedroom faces... north.

604
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:25,844
It really should face west...

605
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:29,385
Oh, I know!
You need a small pond in the garden.

606
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:33,857
A heart-shaped pond
in the south brings luck!

607
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,119
Tell your father, OK?

608
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:36,817
Where's the washing machine?

609
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:41,088
"Build the house your way,"
with all those conditions?

610
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,266
They're just suggestions, you know.

611
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:46,333
Now she says
the bedroom should face west.

612
00:36:46,503 --> 00:36:48,131
Forget the pond.
What a pain to clean.

613
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:50,967
Remember my friend Iriuchijima?

614
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:54,175
His parents had a pond
in their garden,

615
00:36:55,045 --> 00:36:57,514
with a really big Mannequin Pis.

616
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:58,506
Huh...

617
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:00,507
In Belgium, it brings luck.

618
00:37:01,952 --> 00:37:04,945
I don't believe it.
It looked so silly.

619
00:37:05,522 --> 00:37:07,286
You can't take all
that stuff seriously.

620
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:13,288
So the washing machine should
face south, but in my study?

621
00:37:21,905 --> 00:37:22,531
Hello.

622
00:37:22,806 --> 00:37:25,776
Naosuke? Can I speak to Tamiko?

623
00:37:26,243 --> 00:37:27,370
<i>Just one more thing.</i>

624
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,511
Hold on.

625
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,178
My Mom.

626
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:47,492
Hi, it's Tamiko.

627
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:51,968
Listen, about the toilet.
There's only one on the 2nd floor.

628
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:55,270
You really need one
on the 1st floor, too.

629
00:37:57,074 --> 00:38:01,375
A house with no 1st floor toilet
lasts only 3 generations!

630
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,515
What a horrible thought!
I'm begging you.

631
00:38:04,848 --> 00:38:07,215
Speak to your father about it, OK?

632
00:38:09,386 --> 00:38:11,787
If you're going to
have a toilet, I'd say here.

633
00:38:12,489 --> 00:38:15,823
It's near the entrance,
convenient for guests.

634
00:38:17,227 --> 00:38:19,492
- What do you think?
- The end of the hall facing south.

635
00:38:21,031 --> 00:38:21,896
Hey, hey.

636
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,535
You never make a toilet face south.

637
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,402
The trouble with amateurs...

638
00:38:30,607 --> 00:38:32,803
Why waste sunlight on a toilet?

639
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:35,538
You don't get it.
You want it bathed in sunlight.

640
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,111
Bathrooms always face north.

641
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:41,481
Making a bathroom dark is outdated.

642
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:46,249
I'm taking a leak.

643
00:38:54,164 --> 00:38:54,978
Excuse me.

644
00:38:55,097 --> 00:38:56,318
Miss, where's the bathroom?

645
00:39:01,338 --> 00:39:04,001
Which means... Due north.
Thank you!

646
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:12,977
On the northern...
boulevard of bars...

647
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:16,915
You really need one
on the 1st floor?

648
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:21,291
Without one, the house is doomed
after 3 generations, oh boy.

649
00:39:21,948 --> 00:39:23,136
What am I supposed to do?

650
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:26,958
You decide.
It's your house, after all.

651
00:39:34,066 --> 00:39:35,141
I know.

652
00:39:35,672 --> 00:39:38,198
We'll have 2. One north, one south.

653
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:41,274
Who needs so many toilets?

654
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:43,341
It was the only way.

655
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:44,547
And the 2nd floor?

656
00:39:44,681 --> 00:39:45,616
Another one.

657
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,982
What do we need
so many toilets for?

658
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:49,949
Just 3.

659
00:39:50,053 --> 00:39:51,487
A house full of toilets! Yuck!

660
00:39:52,055 --> 00:39:53,387
We can brag about them.

661
00:39:55,058 --> 00:39:57,391
Further right.

662
00:39:57,928 --> 00:39:58,918
That's it, that's it.

663
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,523
All right.

664
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:06,470
Shoot over here, over here!

665
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,131
What's that maestro doing?

666
00:40:10,607 --> 00:40:13,202
He's never been on time.

667
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,408
He's no good, no good.

668
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:17,380
He's got lots of other work.

669
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:18,940
Here he is, he's here.

670
00:40:21,618 --> 00:40:23,348
Can you get a table?

671
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:24,517
Right.

672
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:29,957
What the hell time
does he think it is?

673
00:40:31,728 --> 00:40:35,324
The measurement here? Maestro?

674
00:40:36,266 --> 00:40:37,461
It's there.

675
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:38,558
What's this "7" here?

676
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:39,533
7 inches.

677
00:40:40,537 --> 00:40:41,470
<i>Inches?</i>

678
00:40:44,107 --> 00:40:46,941
I've never built a house in inches.

679
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:50,237
Precisely the problem
with Japanese architecture.

680
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:51,352
C'mere.

681
00:40:51,548 --> 00:40:56,213
The design's Western, but cut to
Japanese sizes, so it's miniaturized.

682
00:40:56,453 --> 00:40:59,514
All wood here is cut
to Japanese measurements.

683
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:06,056
So if you re-cut in inches,
it's a lot of extra work.

684
00:41:06,129 --> 00:41:09,099
Sure it's extra work,
but I say it's essential.

685
00:41:09,451 --> 00:41:10,291
I know!

686
00:41:10,377 --> 00:41:11,572
Who do you think you are?

687
00:41:12,569 --> 00:41:14,470
Can't you use inches?

688
00:41:16,473 --> 00:41:17,668
It comes down to money.

689
00:41:18,408 --> 00:41:19,774
Inches cost more?

690
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:21,101
It's not economical.

691
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:25,142
If you cut a 30 inch plank
from a standard Japanese board,

692
00:41:25,682 --> 00:41:27,412
you waste this much.

693
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:29,209
I see...

694
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,434
I can't!

695
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:36,489
Build a house in inches, dammit!

696
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:39,597
Sir.

697
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:45,497
Let's use the Japanese way.

698
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:53,641
- Chief!
- Yeah!

699
00:41:54,077 --> 00:41:57,479
Gotta bury the well. Need you here!

700
00:41:57,574 --> 00:41:58,666
Be right there.

701
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:01,447
And off I go...

702
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:12,723
Yagida san.

703
00:42:20,103 --> 00:42:21,127
The wrong prayer...

704
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:33,140
You're really good to your father.

705
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,416
But all these disagreements.

706
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:38,315
Don't worry,
you can count on your Dad.

707
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:43,491
Here.

708
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,523
The wrong prayer...

709
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:50,327
We used to call a real priest.

710
00:42:51,072 --> 00:42:51,798
The pipe?

711
00:42:51,867 --> 00:42:54,600
So the water god can breathe.

712
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:56,500
Wow, that's neat.

713
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,302
OK, cover it with earth.

714
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:09,586
Tamiko, you look more and more
like your mother.

715
00:43:09,686 --> 00:43:11,780
Is that supposed to make me happy?

716
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:16,553
Oh, no, no, no... Are you OK?

717
00:43:17,894 --> 00:43:21,661
Building a house at your age
is something to be proud of.

718
00:43:22,799 --> 00:43:24,461
We took a 30 year mortgage.

719
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:27,795
But these days, the banks...

720
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:31,273
don't like to lend money.

721
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:33,910
You have real credibility with them.

722
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:35,669
Impressive.

723
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:38,843
Naosuke, Naosuke.

724
00:43:38,915 --> 00:43:41,350
Yes, Father. Excuse me.

725
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:48,449
Tamiko, Tamiko, he's my son.

726
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:50,686
He's your son?

727
00:43:51,361 --> 00:43:54,160
I'm bringing him on this job.

728
00:43:54,731 --> 00:43:55,805
Nice to meet you.

729
00:43:57,373 --> 00:43:58,543
Where you goin'!

730
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:00,137
The W.C.

731
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:01,327
Not again.

732
00:44:04,374 --> 00:44:06,366
About the maestro.

733
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:10,275
I hate to tell you.
He may be Mr. Modernism and all,

734
00:44:10,747 --> 00:44:15,583
but he's a friggin' amateur when
it comes to construction, trust me.

735
00:44:16,586 --> 00:44:17,651
At this rate,

736
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:21,249
you're never gonna
have a house, Naosuke.

737
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:23,349
So,

738
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:28,730
sorry for the maestro, but
I had Suga draw some other plans.

739
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:30,559
- Show him.
- Yes.

740
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:35,738
Won't you take it home and...

741
00:44:36,773 --> 00:44:38,799
look it over with Tamiko?

742
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,173
Please.

743
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:42,712
Having fun?

744
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,424
Back already?

745
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:55,482
- What's this?
- No good?

746
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:59,463
Of course not!
The 1st floor's all tatami rooms!

747
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,364
It's not a houseboat, you know.

748
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:06,562
Why'd you even bring it home?
Is this what you want?

749
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:10,933
This is getting super complicated.

750
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:13,970
This house'll be great.

751
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:15,778
Nicely curving storybook veranda.

752
00:45:16,111 --> 00:45:17,023
Very storybook.

753
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,443
Go ahead and apply for permits
early next week.

754
00:45:23,386 --> 00:45:24,877
And the Ground-Breaking Ceremony?

755
00:45:26,823 --> 00:45:27,688
It's Tamiko for you.

756
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,527
Sometime this month.
You work it out, OK?

757
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:34,600
My pleasure.

758
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,053
Yeah.

759
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:42,468
I want to build this house.

760
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:45,866
Listen, I hired Yanagisawa.

761
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,568
You can't just do
whatever you please!

762
00:45:49,045 --> 00:45:51,537
This house belongs to me and Naosuke.

763
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:53,881
You just work for us.

764
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:58,549
If you can't listen to your client,
then we'll just have to...

765
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:01,452
hire another contractor.

766
00:46:14,971 --> 00:46:17,907
Party's over. Go home.

767
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:32,078
Tamiko always was...

768
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:35,490
What?

769
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,791
She always was headstrong.

770
00:46:39,648 --> 00:46:40,714
What's that about?

771
00:46:41,898 --> 00:46:44,891
She always did everything
her own way.

772
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:48,368
Always independent.

773
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:50,635
Come to think of it,

774
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:56,377
this is the first time
she's asked me for anything.

775
00:46:58,048 --> 00:46:58,879
Really?

776
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:02,885
And I haven't done,

777
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:07,584
a single thing to make her happy...

778
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:14,656
Now that my daughter finally
comes to me for help.

779
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:29,871
Oh, no...

780
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:33,781
No more toenails left.

781
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:45,428
Suga? It's me.

782
00:47:46,696 --> 00:47:47,994
I'm awful sorry,

783
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:51,929
but about those permits,
can you hold off a little?

784
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:54,992
I'm really sorry.

785
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:59,643
Houses resemble the people
who build them -Italian proverb

786
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:01,887
Houses resemble the people
who build them -Italian proverb
Mind your manners!

787
00:48:01,887 --> 00:48:02,879
Mind your manners!

788
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:06,826
Come over here.

789
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:09,043
How's the house coming?

790
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:10,710
Moving along.

791
00:48:11,187 --> 00:48:15,124
I've never built my own home.
Is it as hard as they say?

792
00:48:15,992 --> 00:48:18,860
Lots of twists and turns, I'd say.

793
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:19,825
Twists?

794
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:22,464
Meat's burning.

795
00:48:22,732 --> 00:48:26,032
I told you not to play
with your food.

796
00:48:26,469 --> 00:48:29,667
How're things... with the maestro?

797
00:48:30,516 --> 00:48:31,555
No news from him?

798
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:34,167
You have to eat your food.

799
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:36,905
Come to Grandpa, Sweetie.

800
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:38,675
No word, recently?

801
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:41,981
Not a peep since then.

802
00:48:43,486 --> 00:48:44,886
I'm sure he's hard at work.

803
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:48,048
- Who? Who?
- It's none of your business.

804
00:48:48,591 --> 00:48:49,854
The designer we hired.

805
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,092
- There a problem?
- It's no big deal.

806
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:55,688
But originally, you'd planned
to be building by now.

807
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:59,136
And you aren't,
which means there's a problem.

808
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:00,465
Cut it out.

809
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:07,204
You know, I've got
my whole crew on hold.

810
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:08,536
Oh, really?

811
00:49:09,612 --> 00:49:12,605
Better put 'em to work soon
or they'll all starve to death.

812
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:17,248
Your grandfather is not a toy!

813
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:19,086
Come over here.

814
00:49:19,689 --> 00:49:21,089
- Are the plans delayed?
- No.

815
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:23,626
Come, let's all eat.

816
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,456
How are all the old guys?

817
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:27,438
They're fine.

818
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:29,623
You've got your hands full, Father.

819
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:33,934
I'm fine, but the guys
I have standing by...

820
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:37,602
What is it?

821
00:49:37,807 --> 00:49:40,675
But that's terrible.
That's the worst.

822
00:49:41,544 --> 00:49:44,514
When you have a chance,
check on Yanagisawa?

823
00:49:44,914 --> 00:49:47,247
- Check?
- On the designer.

824
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:49,143
- Don't bother.
- Yanagisawa?

825
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:51,221
- Not so loud.
- Just ignore him.

826
00:49:51,821 --> 00:49:53,881
Thank God, we're renters.

827
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:57,920
Recklessly build a house,
it's just a pile of worries.

828
00:49:58,828 --> 00:50:00,160
OK, time to eat.

829
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:08,237
The chief's crew is waiting.

830
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:10,797
My philosophy is...

831
00:50:11,941 --> 00:50:14,740
first an artist, second a craftsman.

832
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:18,943
Of course, you have to work to eat.

833
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:23,178
But I can't afford to
squander my talent.

834
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:26,817
Here's what I think.

835
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:31,960
The moment the artist bends
his principles, he's lost his art.

836
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:36,633
When the chief said
he couldn't build to inches,

837
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:39,236
frankly, my interest sank.

838
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:44,871
But I'm a big boy. Having taken
the job, I'll see it through.

839
00:50:45,241 --> 00:50:48,302
But not as an artist.

840
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:52,015
From now on,
it's just another job to me.

841
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:54,116
Then meet your deadline!

842
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:00,122
Isn't that what work's about?

843
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:03,822
I sensed your passion so we waited.

844
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:08,298
But if that's your position,
then we'll reconsider ours.

845
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:14,293
You've got 'til the end of this week.
Otherwise, we'll find someone else.

846
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,834
I'm... a creative person too.

847
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:25,006
I can understand how you feel.
But you're wrong.

848
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:28,648
The artist and the craftsman
don't conflict.

849
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:33,048
Without passion, a craftsman
might as well be a machine.

850
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:36,856
And an artist who can't sell
his work, is just a weirdo.

851
00:51:41,197 --> 00:51:43,928
It's a question of
where you compromise.

852
00:51:45,201 --> 00:51:48,069
If you want to consider this
just a job, that's fine.

853
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:51,370
But I don't want to sacrifice
your artistic passion,

854
00:51:52,308 --> 00:51:53,776
and it's not that difficult.

855
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,011
Here's what I want, OK?

856
00:52:01,784 --> 00:52:02,676
Yes.

857
00:52:03,219 --> 00:52:06,189
That you finish the work
as an artist,

858
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:09,324
by the end of the week,
like a craftsman.

859
00:52:12,061 --> 00:52:13,723
On one condition.

860
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:20,928
The front door opens in.

861
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:24,805
On that, I will not budge.

862
00:52:29,812 --> 00:52:33,271
Ground-Breaking Ceremony

863
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,794
I hereby undertake...

864
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:22,025
the ritual purification of this land.

865
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:47,756
Thanks for everything.
I think it'll be a lovely house.

866
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:53,424
- Hey, what are they up to?
- Purifying the land.

867
00:53:53,796 --> 00:53:55,924
- What are they throwing?
- Rice, salt and paper.

868
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:57,358
Are they going to clean it up?

869
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,035
Um, excuse me.

870
00:54:02,939 --> 00:54:03,692
Here.

871
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,103
Huh?

872
00:54:05,508 --> 00:54:08,103
See that bamboo branch?

873
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:10,809
Dig under it with this.

874
00:54:11,441 --> 00:54:12,340
Dig?

875
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:13,847
It's part of the ritual.

876
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:16,285
You go, "Heave, ho." Twice, please.

877
00:54:17,353 --> 00:54:18,392
Be serious about it.

878
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:19,545
You, too, Tamiko.

879
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:20,924
Me, too?

880
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:22,419
Both of you, please.

881
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:35,696
Please proceed.

882
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:38,629
Here goes!

883
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:44,109
Ready, heave, ho.

884
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:24,016
Architect, the honorable Yanagisawa.

885
00:55:27,156 --> 00:55:28,488
Your turn, maestro.

886
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:30,018
No, I...

887
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:30,990
Please.

888
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:48,841
Ciao.

889
00:55:51,447 --> 00:55:53,382
- What the hell!
- The jerk!

890
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:57,476
Over, over, OK.

891
00:55:57,587 --> 00:55:58,452
Jr.!

892
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:01,284
That's the last one, chief.

893
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:03,655
That's it.

894
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:30,918
It's no use, I'm blocked.
Can I go home and think it over?

895
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,952
They're starting to panic on set.

896
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:39,428
We should really stop wringing laughs
out of those monster suits.

897
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:41,490
How's the house coming?

898
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:45,365
I have my troubles
in that department, too.

899
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:47,326
Send the e-mail.

900
00:57:01,117 --> 00:57:04,576
My juices stop flowing
when there's water north of me.

901
00:57:04,772 --> 00:57:06,037
Could you move?

902
00:57:09,091 --> 00:57:11,686
Got yourself some great pillars.

903
00:57:12,094 --> 00:57:12,652
Yeah.

904
00:57:13,496 --> 00:57:15,931
It'll be one sturdy house.

905
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:21,196
Be hard put to find a house
these days,

906
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:22,913
built of this quality lumber.

907
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,937
Just like you, chief,
giving it your best.

908
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:32,047
Should be ready for the Roof-Laying
Ceremony later this week.

909
00:57:33,382 --> 00:57:35,408
Can't wait for the Japanese room.

910
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:41,224
Just between you and me.

911
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:42,522
Yes.

912
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:49,221
The plans call for 6 tatami mats,

913
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:54,602
but I gave myself
permission to make it 20.

914
00:57:55,705 --> 00:58:00,234
Won't you get in trouble?
The maestro'll flip out.

915
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:03,641
The Japanese room's mine
to design as I like.

916
00:58:05,114 --> 00:58:09,347
I gave in on paper, but hey,
we're the ones building it.

917
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:17,093
Roof-Laying Ceremony

918
00:58:17,093 --> 00:58:18,127
Roof-Laying Ceremony
What ceremony?

919
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:18,423
Roof-Laying Ceremony

920
00:58:18,794 --> 00:58:22,253
There's all kinds of ceremonies.
At the Roof-Laying,

921
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:27,567
you drink sake, show gratitude for all
their work, and pray for a good house.

922
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:29,572
But we just prayed the other day.

923
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,301
That was the Ground-Breaking.

924
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:37,179
We prayed to the gods to
protect our land, totally different.

925
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:40,442
You aren't a builder's daughter
for nothing.

926
00:58:41,817 --> 00:58:43,376
He wants you to make a speech.

927
00:58:45,121 --> 00:58:47,056
Me? A speech?

928
00:58:47,189 --> 00:58:48,817
I hope Yanagisawa shows.

929
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:51,660
- About what?
- What a drag.

930
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:56,089
I sure hope they'll all listen.

931
00:58:56,699 --> 00:59:00,136
I don't want a repeat of
that party at Mom's.

932
00:59:00,269 --> 00:59:01,328
That was hopeless.

933
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:04,199
Of course they all watched
the Filipino dancer next to you.

934
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:05,603
Let's go to sleep.

935
00:59:06,275 --> 00:59:08,676
That was the worst speech.

936
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:13,341
How many people?

937
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:15,244
Probably a dozen.

938
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:19,711
Will they have a microphone?

939
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:32,661
Once more.

940
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:34,858
Once more.

941
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:44,877
You're in the way.

942
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:47,844
We'll be late, Mom.

943
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:49,784
Don't worry.

944
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:16,310
All done!

945
01:00:19,181 --> 01:00:20,021
Bravo, chief!

946
01:00:20,549 --> 01:00:21,244
You're the best!

947
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:36,421
Hey, hey!

948
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:37,628
What?

949
01:00:37,733 --> 01:00:39,171
What are these guys doing here?

950
01:00:39,735 --> 01:00:42,728
You said a dozen.
I've never seen half these guys.

951
01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:48,802
It's the best being
on a job with you.

952
01:00:49,211 --> 01:00:49,871
Thanks.

953
01:00:50,946 --> 01:00:53,575
Time to toast your labors, chief.

954
01:00:53,949 --> 01:00:55,349
Let me pour you one.

955
01:00:56,585 --> 01:00:57,644
Drink up.

956
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:03,752
That's the way.
You're a good looking man, chief.

957
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:07,797
Don't egg him on too much.
It'll go to his head.

958
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:11,260
Mother, look.

959
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,333
Oh, here you are.

960
01:01:15,404 --> 01:01:16,201
It's so far away.

961
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:17,398
Yes, it is, whatever.

962
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:18,539
What is it?

963
01:01:19,241 --> 01:01:21,608
Well, I know it's a little early,

964
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:25,737
but you're making a pond, so
I thought you could use a statue.

965
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:30,410
This, is my...
house-warming present.

966
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:35,758
It's a Mannequin Pis, supposed
to be good luck in Belgium.

967
01:01:38,794 --> 01:01:41,423
I never heard about a pond!
What the hell is this!

968
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:43,330
What's this about a pond here!

969
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:46,727
Naosuke, didn't you tell your mother
we gave up on the pond?

970
01:01:46,802 --> 01:01:49,533
There's no pond here.

971
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:50,962
Is there a microphone?

972
01:01:53,709 --> 01:01:54,642
Hello.

973
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,574
I came for his speech.

974
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:03,619
Thank you, the ceremony's over
and the party's heating up.

975
01:02:05,287 --> 01:02:06,448
Please, take a look inside.

976
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:07,751
Where's the pond going...

977
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:11,225
- The pond?
- The pond, in the south.

978
01:02:11,293 --> 01:02:13,319
I'm sure it's over there.

979
01:02:13,462 --> 01:02:14,172
This way.

980
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:16,208
Just put it over there for now.

981
01:02:16,465 --> 01:02:17,710
What pond is she talking about?

982
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:24,699
Everybody drinking?

983
01:02:30,846 --> 01:02:33,338
Thank God it didn't snow, chief.

984
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:36,162
Is there a micro...

985
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:37,829
Oh, a microphone...?

986
01:02:41,857 --> 01:02:43,325
Do you have a minute?

987
01:02:44,426 --> 01:02:47,988
I just noticed, do you mind?
That's the Japanese room, right?

988
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:49,460
Yes.

989
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:52,900
It feels too big,
it's only supposed to be 6 mats.

990
01:02:55,638 --> 01:02:56,970
It's not right. Hey, chief.

991
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:02,335
How many mats did
you end up going with?

992
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:03,883
How many what?

993
01:03:03,979 --> 01:03:05,072
In the Japanese room.

994
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:09,815
The Japanese room has 6 mats,
of course.

995
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:11,486
Right, Suga?

996
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:15,899
It doesn't make sense.

997
01:03:17,693 --> 01:03:21,596
Weren't you told?
The chief ordered a 20 mat room.

998
01:03:22,064 --> 01:03:23,396
That huge?

999
01:03:24,767 --> 01:03:25,789
Since when?

1000
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:28,168
No turning back?

1001
01:03:28,637 --> 01:03:30,697
The structure's already up.

1002
01:03:35,377 --> 01:03:36,436
I'm so sorry.

1003
01:03:36,779 --> 01:03:38,714
I'm fine, but what about you?

1004
01:03:39,882 --> 01:03:41,874
I guess I don't have a choice.

1005
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:49,053
Hey, folks, time for the man of
the house to say a few words.

1006
01:03:49,758 --> 01:03:50,748
Quiet down.

1007
01:03:57,232 --> 01:03:57,959
Here we go.

1008
01:03:58,801 --> 01:03:59,962
The word "house"...

1009
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:00,953
What's that?

1010
01:04:01,737 --> 01:04:02,705
There they are!

1011
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:05,767
You're late,
hurry up and get ready!

1012
01:04:07,042 --> 01:04:09,443
Folks, these are dancers
from my club.

1013
01:04:11,947 --> 01:04:13,540
A celebration dance...

1014
01:04:17,686 --> 01:04:18,619
Yanagisawa...

1015
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:26,925
Oh, what the hell.
Who gives a damn!

1016
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:29,929
Only you guys know how I feel!

1017
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:41,577
Even the Arch of Triumph was built by
an architect and a builder -A builder

1018
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:44,103
Even the Arch of Triumph was built by
an architect and a builder -A builder
And the interior?
Chosen wall colors yet?

1019
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:48,883
I'm sick of waiting for him,
so he's coming to the site,

1020
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,219
making decisions on the spot.

1021
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:52,983
That must be tough.

1022
01:04:53,622 --> 01:04:54,783
The Japanese room?

1023
01:04:55,557 --> 01:04:56,889
It's working out just fine.

1024
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:00,921
How wonderful, Dad,
your dream came true.

1025
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:03,025
You're good to your father.

1026
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:05,242
What will it look like?

1027
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:09,671
I want to go with "juraku."

1028
01:05:10,773 --> 01:05:11,604
Juraku?

1029
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:14,142
What's juraku?

1030
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:15,769
Never heard of it.

1031
01:05:16,912 --> 01:05:21,407
It's kind of rare these days.
I'll show you when it's done.

1032
01:05:22,217 --> 01:05:23,879
Makes me so nervous!

1033
01:05:24,753 --> 01:05:26,654
I bet it'll be a real problem.

1034
01:05:26,722 --> 01:05:27,849
You shut up!

1035
01:05:29,792 --> 01:05:31,226
I recommend this one.

1036
01:05:34,229 --> 01:05:35,822
I think it looks great.

1037
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:38,063
Maestro?

1038
01:05:38,934 --> 01:05:41,631
No fluorescent lights.
Incandescents in the study.

1039
01:05:42,466 --> 01:05:43,532
This one, please.

1040
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:47,676
I want the study to be austere.

1041
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:56,146
Maestro, uneducated as I am,
I can't make this out, Chew...

1042
01:05:58,053 --> 01:05:59,021
Two, Too...

1043
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:02,988
Tudor style, it's what
Frank Lloyd Wright preferred.

1044
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:07,187
Don't know him.

1045
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:09,060
You don't have to. Just order it.

1046
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:11,664
Impossible.

1047
01:06:13,488 --> 01:06:14,138
Why not?

1048
01:06:14,181 --> 01:06:18,096
No time.
If we order it now, it's too late.

1049
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:20,472
It's your job to
get it here on time.

1050
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:24,570
If the maestro had made up his mind,
he could have anything.

1051
01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:27,940
Sorry, but you pick
from what's available.

1052
01:06:29,218 --> 01:06:31,187
Cut the bullshit and
pick one of these!

1053
01:06:31,286 --> 01:06:32,369
There's nothing here!

1054
01:06:32,888 --> 01:06:34,880
Let's order this one. Make a note.

1055
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:36,321
I'm the designer!

1056
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:40,626
I'm the contractor.

1057
01:06:42,564 --> 01:06:46,296
It's my job to finish the house
on time, maestro.

1058
01:06:47,703 --> 01:06:48,898
We use this one in the study.

1059
01:06:49,671 --> 01:06:52,004
A-45?

1060
01:06:57,146 --> 01:06:58,133
Now he's pissed.

1061
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:01,811
Let him order you around,
it'll never get built, right?

1062
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:03,050
Right.

1063
01:07:07,222 --> 01:07:08,246
The door won't open!

1064
01:07:09,091 --> 01:07:10,616
Pull it towards you.

1065
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:14,128
Most doors open out.

1066
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:25,665
Bye, teacher.

1067
01:07:25,774 --> 01:07:27,208
Bye.

1068
01:07:39,888 --> 01:07:40,787
Bye.

1069
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:48,557
Hello.

1070
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:49,688
Hello.

1071
01:07:49,798 --> 01:07:51,061
Great to see you, Tamiko.

1072
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,992
It's coming along.

1073
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:57,773
I brought you some snacks.

1074
01:07:59,174 --> 01:08:00,066
And now?

1075
01:08:00,275 --> 01:08:02,938
He's choosing colors
for the living room.

1076
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:05,077
White walls are so great.

1077
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:06,421
Ivory, not white.

1078
01:08:07,015 --> 01:08:10,816
To our way of thinking,
it's not a color we'd use.

1079
01:08:10,886 --> 01:08:13,617
White shows dirt,
so most people avoid it.

1080
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:16,587
People use it and it shows wear.

1081
01:08:16,959 --> 01:08:19,190
That's what we call lived-in.

1082
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:21,390
Sounds far-fetched to me.

1083
01:08:22,064 --> 01:08:25,125
People don't paint these days,
they use cloth.

1084
01:08:25,734 --> 01:08:26,394
Cloth?

1085
01:08:26,668 --> 01:08:27,473
Wallpaper.

1086
01:08:28,036 --> 01:08:31,097
But these days,
they've got great wallpaper.

1087
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,036
Don't have to bother with paint.

1088
01:08:37,713 --> 01:08:39,682
I'd like a muted version...

1089
01:08:40,922 --> 01:08:41,753
of this chip.

1090
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:44,786
That's a custom color.

1091
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:46,279
Well then, make it.

1092
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:54,095
Fine, then,
it's a good color, done.

1093
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:55,963
Done, next.

1094
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,095
That's 726-3.

1095
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:01,226
It's always like this.

1096
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:02,733
I feel bad.

1097
01:09:02,804 --> 01:09:04,136
My job is to compromise.

1098
01:09:05,107 --> 01:09:05,938
Maestro.

1099
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:08,070
It'll be a great house.

1100
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:10,802
Sorry, move over.

1101
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:13,339
Maestro, about the bathroom tiles.

1102
01:09:14,249 --> 01:09:16,218
These are the only ones available.

1103
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:17,786
Fine, you choose.

1104
01:09:17,986 --> 01:09:18,919
Oh, please.

1105
01:09:18,987 --> 01:09:21,441
Go ahead, the maestro says
it's up to you, so let's decide.

1106
01:09:24,393 --> 01:09:28,091
But the corners need to be,
what's it called, exactly?

1107
01:09:28,864 --> 01:09:30,924
The rounded corner that curves.

1108
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,448
What's that?

1109
01:09:32,773 --> 01:09:33,709
What's up, chief?

1110
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:37,736
Don't you know? The corner piece
has an oriental feel.

1111
01:09:38,473 --> 01:09:40,408
You better start making some sense.

1112
01:09:42,277 --> 01:09:43,074
Just wait a minute.

1113
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:48,484
Now what?

1114
01:09:53,855 --> 01:09:57,485
If it's too specialized,
it'll take time to find.

1115
01:09:58,827 --> 01:10:01,126
You know the kind of tile I mean.

1116
01:10:05,867 --> 01:10:08,894
What the hell is that?
What the hell.

1117
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,068
Go with what we've got.

1118
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:14,741
Dad.

1119
01:10:15,877 --> 01:10:17,971
There's no time, c'mon, OK?

1120
01:10:19,514 --> 01:10:22,507
What exactly am I doing here?
Tell me!

1121
01:10:23,151 --> 01:10:25,143
This one and that one.

1122
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:29,951
What is this pillar doing here!

1123
01:10:31,159 --> 01:10:33,128
The central pillar's
the heart of a house!

1124
01:11:39,127 --> 01:11:42,529
Ultimately, your Dad and
Yanagisawa are the same.

1125
01:11:43,298 --> 01:11:45,995
They're both craftsman,
who believe in themselves.

1126
01:11:46,401 --> 01:11:48,495
That's why they butt heads.

1127
01:11:49,404 --> 01:11:50,531
Maybe you're right.

1128
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:54,008
If you ask me,
they're twins separated at birth.

1129
01:11:58,547 --> 01:12:00,982
He's useless.

1130
01:12:02,317 --> 01:12:06,413
What's his thing? He ask for stuff
we don't have on purpose?

1131
01:12:06,588 --> 01:12:08,216
Not necessarily.

1132
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:12,918
All that fancy crap
and always in English, too.

1133
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:17,565
Well, I don't like it.
We got lots of good stuff in Japan.

1134
01:12:18,967 --> 01:12:20,629
Chief, this...

1135
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:24,933
This might just be "bamboo-tile."

1136
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,576
What's bamboo-tile?

1137
01:12:33,148 --> 01:12:36,949
In old houses,
they usually used this tile

1138
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:40,088
in bathroom corners.

1139
01:12:40,655 --> 01:12:42,419
Hardly see it, these days.

1140
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,589
I'm impressed
the maestro knew about it.

1141
01:12:50,565 --> 01:12:51,965
Just might be, chief,

1142
01:12:53,034 --> 01:12:57,267
that he's the one stuck on
doing things the old way.

1143
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:07,282
Wow, this tile brings back memories,
are you using it?

1144
01:13:21,696 --> 01:13:22,994
It's coming along.

1145
01:13:24,065 --> 01:13:26,034
White walls aren't bad,
are they, chief?

1146
01:13:27,969 --> 01:13:28,922
Not bad...

1147
01:13:29,243 --> 01:13:33,146
We're so used to wallpaper,
it'd never occur to us.

1148
01:13:34,989 --> 01:13:35,597
Father.

1149
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:38,946
Chief, they need you
to check the juraku.

1150
01:13:39,047 --> 01:13:39,707
Right.

1151
01:13:41,616 --> 01:13:42,481
Here goes.

1152
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:48,716
The chief seems to like it.

1153
01:13:49,424 --> 01:13:51,325
I was aiming for
a more muted shade.

1154
01:13:52,027 --> 01:13:53,495
I think it's neat the way it is.

1155
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:57,324
This house is riddled with
compromises, everywhere.

1156
01:14:03,333 --> 01:14:04,679
I'll check out the Japanese room.

1157
01:14:16,418 --> 01:14:17,283
How is it?

1158
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:18,944
It's uneven there.

1159
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:20,484
Here?

1160
01:14:22,324 --> 01:14:25,226
Look, Naosuke.
That's what we call juraku.

1161
01:14:26,561 --> 01:14:29,224
It erases the boundary
between ceiling and wall.

1162
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:34,127
That's how our ancestors expressed
the vastness of the universe.

1163
01:14:35,003 --> 01:14:36,164
Wow, I see.

1164
01:14:37,874 --> 01:14:39,078
Father, do you mind?

1165
01:14:42,677 --> 01:14:45,169
Yanagisawa seems kind of depressed.

1166
01:14:47,682 --> 01:14:51,084
If I recall, he specializes in...

1167
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,653
He's an interior designer.

1168
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:59,594
Where can I see a place he created?

1169
01:15:02,597 --> 01:15:07,501
I figure it can't
hurt to take a look...

1170
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:18,814
Seriously?

1171
01:15:19,114 --> 01:15:23,484
OK, then I'll work in something
on the Mecha-mermaid theme.

1172
01:15:24,085 --> 01:15:27,453
Right, right, right, I understand.

1173
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:34,591
What would you like?
Anything you don't eat?

1174
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:38,125
Father, why are you so tense?

1175
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:41,602
It's my first time
in such a fancy joint.

1176
01:15:41,836 --> 01:15:44,772
Yanagisawa designed this place.

1177
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:46,807
He did?

1178
01:15:48,109 --> 01:15:49,372
Seems to be pretty popular.

1179
01:15:50,812 --> 01:15:52,576
It's really elegant, isn't it?

1180
01:15:52,747 --> 01:15:54,079
This table, too?

1181
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:55,646
Is it?

1182
01:15:55,817 --> 01:15:57,649
That's what designers do, after all.

1183
01:16:01,623 --> 01:16:03,319
It's really well made,
and sturdy, too.

1184
01:16:04,125 --> 01:16:06,856
The chief wanted to see
a place that you designed.

1185
01:16:10,051 --> 01:16:10,945
What would you like?

1186
01:16:16,705 --> 01:16:17,604
Oh, excuse me.

1187
01:16:18,373 --> 01:16:21,400
Oh, I finally
spoke to him about that.

1188
01:16:25,513 --> 01:16:27,175
What's the specialty of the house?

1189
01:16:28,116 --> 01:16:29,209
Everything's good.

1190
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:31,677
- You order.
- Not for me.

1191
01:16:32,187 --> 01:16:33,746
- Not eating?
- Not at night.

1192
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:37,191
You need three square meals a day...

1193
01:16:38,215 --> 01:16:39,541
If you want to live a long life.

1194
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:41,386
I don't especially want to.

1195
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:44,697
That's what all young guys say.

1196
01:16:47,302 --> 01:16:48,361
Oh, right...

1197
01:16:56,444 --> 01:16:59,209
This what you had in mind, maestro?

1198
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:03,445
It's called "bamboo-tile."

1199
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,546
Scoured every tile dealer in Tokyo.

1200
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:11,189
Finally found some
squirreled away in storage.

1201
01:17:16,398 --> 01:17:17,866
I'm impressed you knew.

1202
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,728
I remember seeing it as a kid.

1203
01:17:21,936 --> 01:17:24,929
I'm startin' to get the picture.

1204
01:17:26,241 --> 01:17:29,678
Boils down to...
you like old stuff, right?

1205
01:17:30,712 --> 01:17:31,702
Nailed you, right?

1206
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:36,444
Whenever we show you
new catalogues,

1207
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:40,719
you always turn 'em down.

1208
01:17:42,724 --> 01:17:45,250
It's easy to find
cheap and convenient things.

1209
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:47,762
So, everything ends up
being predictable.

1210
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:53,298
Predictable lives, predictable homes.
I can't stand them.

1211
01:17:55,236 --> 01:17:57,637
What I'm looking for
isn't so special.

1212
01:17:58,907 --> 01:18:00,432
I just want the basics.

1213
01:18:00,875 --> 01:18:04,573
There aren't enough of the basics
in this country.

1214
01:18:07,248 --> 01:18:09,649
Is convenience so wonderful?

1215
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:13,948
Is spending time and effort
really a waste?

1216
01:18:16,109 --> 01:18:17,148
You order?

1217
01:18:19,494 --> 01:18:20,612
What's that?

1218
01:18:20,795 --> 01:18:21,956
The kind I told you about.

1219
01:18:22,397 --> 01:18:23,296
Wow.

1220
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:25,232
The chief managed to find it.

1221
01:18:25,734 --> 01:18:27,828
Really? Is that true?

1222
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:30,711
So, you'll use it?

1223
01:18:30,754 --> 01:18:32,230
It costs a little more,

1224
01:18:32,674 --> 01:18:34,870
but my son-in-law will
have to live with that.

1225
01:18:35,577 --> 01:18:38,638
Guess I'll have to.
C'mon, let's order.

1226
01:18:40,248 --> 01:18:42,649
Something salty, salty.

1227
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:47,813
All of these are salty.

1228
01:18:50,525 --> 01:18:52,289
This salmon carpaccia.

1229
01:18:52,994 --> 01:18:54,042
Carpacci O.

1230
01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:56,754
Carpacci A.

1231
01:18:57,866 --> 01:19:01,769
Oh, that's great.
Dad's got his sweet side, too.

1232
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:05,420
What's wrong?

1233
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:08,475
What's got you down?

1234
01:19:23,691 --> 01:19:25,353
Looks delicious.

1235
01:19:26,327 --> 01:19:28,455
Is that special salt?

1236
01:19:28,897 --> 01:19:31,526
No, people prize
Mediterranean salt,

1237
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:34,296
but I don't think it works.
I use Japanese salt.

1238
01:19:34,569 --> 01:19:36,060
Mighty particular.

1239
01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:38,266
Cheers.

1240
01:19:41,609 --> 01:19:42,975
- I'll mix a new one.
- What?

1241
01:19:43,378 --> 01:19:45,313
I used too much salt.

1242
01:19:45,413 --> 01:19:46,392
But why!

1243
01:19:46,681 --> 01:19:47,746
It's my fault.

1244
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:49,577
A real pro.

1245
01:19:51,019 --> 01:19:52,783
I'm only paying for one.

1246
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:53,996
Of course.

1247
01:19:57,244 --> 01:19:58,041
No good.

1248
01:19:58,960 --> 01:19:59,859
Hurry up.

1249
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:01,552
It's my problem.

1250
01:20:02,096 --> 01:20:03,359
A real pro.

1251
01:20:07,287 --> 01:20:08,040
No good.

1252
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:09,738
What's no good?

1253
01:20:11,372 --> 01:20:12,396
It's my problem.

1254
01:20:19,447 --> 01:20:20,676
No good.

1255
01:20:31,059 --> 01:20:32,527
It's my problem.

1256
01:21:01,921 --> 01:21:02,995
What is this?

1257
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:06,092
Somebody got in last night.

1258
01:21:07,061 --> 01:21:07,926
Goddammit!

1259
01:21:08,429 --> 01:21:10,921
- But, who?
- The door was locked.

1260
01:21:11,599 --> 01:21:14,398
The windows weren't tampered with.

1261
01:21:14,836 --> 01:21:18,534
In other words,
it was someone who had a key.

1262
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:33,164
Color's looking good.

1263
01:21:35,523 --> 01:21:38,152
You, you did this!

1264
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:42,303
You asshole!

1265
01:21:48,436 --> 01:21:52,498
I don't give a damn
whether you like it or not.

1266
01:21:53,508 --> 01:21:56,876
But once we decide something,

1267
01:21:58,479 --> 01:22:01,039
you've got to live with it.
In this world,

1268
01:22:03,051 --> 01:22:06,988
you rarely get your own way.
And if you don't like it,

1269
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:12,124
stay at home and paint pictures!

1270
01:22:12,493 --> 01:22:13,791
That's right!

1271
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:19,031
If you're going to get
in my way, get lost!

1272
01:22:19,767 --> 01:22:21,531
Don't you ever show
your face here again!

1273
01:22:21,903 --> 01:22:22,769
Get lost!

1274
01:22:31,779 --> 01:22:38,879
Rain's good for a house being built:
helps it to grow roots - a wise builder

1275
01:22:45,602 --> 01:22:46,746
It's really raining.

1276
01:22:47,195 --> 01:22:49,164
They announced a storm warning.

1277
01:22:49,731 --> 01:22:52,792
I hope our house is OK.
Think it's covered well?

1278
01:22:59,173 --> 01:23:00,197
I'm stepping out.

1279
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:09,911
Hi, Mom, is Dad there?

1280
01:23:10,585 --> 01:23:12,577
<i>He went over
to check on the house.</i>

1281
01:23:13,015 --> 01:23:14,046
What did he say?

1282
01:23:14,822 --> 01:23:17,758
<i>He thought it'd be fne.
Just wanted to make sure.</i>

1283
01:23:18,593 --> 01:23:20,926
OK, thanks, bye, bye.

1284
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:27,735
My Dad went to check.
Says it should be fine...

1285
01:23:28,136 --> 01:23:29,661
Try his cell phone.

1286
01:23:40,214 --> 01:23:42,683
<i>...you are calling
is out of range...</i>

1287
01:23:43,117 --> 01:23:44,517
No answer.

1288
01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:45,643
Must be driving.

1289
01:24:43,845 --> 01:24:45,279
I was in the neighborhood.

1290
01:24:56,224 --> 01:24:57,920
I checked the 2nd floor.

1291
01:24:59,026 --> 01:25:00,187
I'll check the bedroom.

1292
01:25:07,969 --> 01:25:08,939
It's ringing!

1293
01:25:09,971 --> 01:25:12,065
Oh, hello, Dad? Where are you?

1294
01:25:12,874 --> 01:25:16,675
I built you a sturdy house, after all.
This little bit of rain's nothing.

1295
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:18,424
Don't you worry.

1296
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:21,140
Oh, thank goodness.

1297
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:25,217
What! Yanagisawa's there, too?

1298
01:25:26,988 --> 01:25:28,820
Yanagisawa? Why?

1299
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:30,349
What's he doing there?

1300
01:25:31,125 --> 01:25:33,219
Fixing me a cup of tea.

1301
01:25:35,696 --> 01:25:37,665
We both just ended up here.

1302
01:25:38,332 --> 01:25:39,630
How lovely.

1303
01:25:39,767 --> 01:25:40,928
What are they up to?

1304
01:25:41,169 --> 01:25:43,695
Apparently he was worried, too.
Got a soft side, too.

1305
01:25:44,888 --> 01:25:45,971
Let me talk to him.

1306
01:25:47,175 --> 01:25:49,371
Hello, what are you up to?

1307
01:25:52,747 --> 01:25:53,715
Thank you.

1308
01:25:54,916 --> 01:25:56,282
Really, both of you?

1309
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:00,379
Why are you going?

1310
01:26:00,839 --> 01:26:02,160
- 'Cause, I'm worried.
- About what?

1311
01:26:02,256 --> 01:26:03,349
There's a storm watch.

1312
01:26:03,758 --> 01:26:05,954
Yanagisawa's there, too.

1313
01:26:06,093 --> 01:26:08,153
- It's not up to them.
- Why not?

1314
01:26:08,296 --> 01:26:09,388
It's our house, after all.

1315
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:12,997
Naosuke. What's this about?

1316
01:26:14,135 --> 01:26:15,159
What's wrong with you?

1317
01:26:18,806 --> 01:26:19,967
We can't leave them alone.

1318
01:26:20,308 --> 01:26:22,243
But they seem to be getting along.

1319
01:26:22,443 --> 01:26:23,561
That's why I'm going!

1320
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:27,778
You're not making any sense.
I don't get it.

1321
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:31,850
I'm afraid those fellow craftsmen
might hit it off.

1322
01:26:31,953 --> 01:26:33,166
What's wrong with that?

1323
01:26:39,927 --> 01:26:42,260
What's the point of getting jealous?

1324
01:26:44,094 --> 01:26:44,763
Don't stop me.

1325
01:26:44,832 --> 01:26:49,361
And your deadline?
You haven't written a word!

1326
01:26:55,843 --> 01:26:59,871
We might as well wait
'til my son-in-law arrives.

1327
01:27:00,314 --> 01:27:02,044
Why's he coming?

1328
01:27:04,278 --> 01:27:05,177
I wonder...

1329
01:27:05,486 --> 01:27:07,751
I've got work to do.
Give him my regards.

1330
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:10,457
Thanks for stopping in.

1331
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:07,009
It's all my fault.

1332
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,030
Why did you come?

1333
01:28:27,134 --> 01:28:30,036
They'll tow your van tomorrow.

1334
01:28:30,504 --> 01:28:32,200
- Sorry for the trouble.
- It's my fault.

1335
01:28:32,606 --> 01:28:34,268
No one's to blame, in this rain.

1336
01:28:35,943 --> 01:28:37,206
I'm just glad you're OK.

1337
01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:41,243
I feel bad for the chief.

1338
01:28:44,218 --> 01:28:45,242
Your house, then?

1339
01:28:52,927 --> 01:28:54,054
Stop, stop, stop!

1340
01:28:56,297 --> 01:28:59,165
He was moving a piece of furniture.

1341
01:29:00,568 --> 01:29:01,365
Furniture?

1342
01:29:02,436 --> 01:29:07,033
Headed back to repair it overnight,
when I hit him.

1343
01:29:08,109 --> 01:29:09,304
I see.

1344
01:29:10,378 --> 01:29:13,906
It belongs to a special client.
He's got to restore it by morning.

1345
01:29:35,369 --> 01:29:37,235
An Edwardian cylinder bureau.

1346
01:29:38,139 --> 01:29:40,199
Was it this much of a wreck?

1347
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:41,676
Of course not.

1348
01:29:43,043 --> 01:29:45,137
The drawers stuck, that's all.

1349
01:29:47,148 --> 01:29:48,275
This is hopeless.

1350
01:29:55,338 --> 01:29:56,381
How much was it worth?

1351
01:29:56,467 --> 01:29:57,526
2 million yen.

1352
01:29:59,693 --> 01:30:00,541
Let's fix it!

1353
01:30:02,229 --> 01:30:03,225
It's impossible.

1354
01:30:03,397 --> 01:30:04,922
- But...
- I'll pay damages.

1355
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:06,150
Who can afford it?

1356
01:30:06,218 --> 01:30:07,660
Even money can't fix this mess.

1357
01:30:08,035 --> 01:30:09,298
Get me my tool box.

1358
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:14,501
You can't fix it.

1359
01:30:15,176 --> 01:30:16,508
Not if you don't try.

1360
01:30:16,977 --> 01:30:17,967
There's no way!

1361
01:30:22,249 --> 01:30:24,377
We've got all night to
put it back together, right?

1362
01:30:25,686 --> 01:30:26,619
I'll give it a try.

1363
01:30:26,687 --> 01:30:30,055
What do you know about it!
It's Edwardian!

1364
01:30:32,393 --> 01:30:36,421
And what do you know!
I'm a Japanese carpenter!

1365
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:41,669
Been one for 51 years.

1366
01:30:45,372 --> 01:30:49,036
Besides, no matter what we do,

1367
01:30:51,011 --> 01:30:53,003
it won't get any worse than it is.

1368
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:04,422
Let's trust Japanese carpentry.

1369
01:31:23,644 --> 01:31:24,640
A general idea...

1370
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:30,920
This is how it should look.

1371
01:31:35,456 --> 01:31:36,321
That's no use.

1372
01:31:40,194 --> 01:31:40,991
OK.

1373
01:31:41,729 --> 01:31:42,719
Chief.

1374
01:31:44,832 --> 01:31:48,667
Let's remove everything
that isn't solid.

1375
01:31:49,336 --> 01:31:50,133
Dismantle?

1376
01:31:50,271 --> 01:31:51,364
Yes, melt the glue.

1377
01:31:52,039 --> 01:31:54,668
I need you to go boil some water.

1378
01:31:55,175 --> 01:31:55,608
Sure.

1379
01:31:55,709 --> 01:31:58,474
And I need a tube,
as narrow as possible.

1380
01:31:59,113 --> 01:31:59,739
Sure.

1381
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:20,132
Here goes.

1382
01:32:23,804 --> 01:32:25,052
I think it's about ready.

1383
01:32:51,732 --> 01:32:52,825
Hot, hot, hot!

1384
01:32:54,401 --> 01:32:55,266
Hot!

1385
01:32:55,502 --> 01:32:56,868
It's hot, Father!

1386
01:33:08,449 --> 01:33:09,382
There.

1387
01:33:14,388 --> 01:33:15,610
Any usable nails?

1388
01:33:16,690 --> 01:33:18,318
- None.
- Any new ones?

1389
01:33:18,826 --> 01:33:19,875
Plenty of nails here.

1390
01:33:19,918 --> 01:33:21,886
But these nail heads are
vintage, unique.

1391
01:33:23,163 --> 01:33:24,529
Don't have any here.

1392
01:33:25,232 --> 01:33:25,892
Oh, no.

1393
01:33:26,248 --> 01:33:27,193
We'll make them.

1394
01:33:27,368 --> 01:33:28,225
Make them?

1395
01:33:29,167 --> 01:33:30,242
We do it all the time.

1396
01:33:38,445 --> 01:33:39,572
Line up all the pieces.

1397
01:33:46,387 --> 01:33:47,912
Right there.
That one next.

1398
01:33:48,589 --> 01:33:50,421
Hurry.
Losing your pants.

1399
01:33:56,521 --> 01:33:57,734
Start with the main frame.

1400
01:33:58,766 --> 01:34:00,735
Attach #18 to #34.

1401
01:34:01,502 --> 01:34:02,299
Right.

1402
01:34:20,254 --> 01:34:21,347
It's coming along.

1403
01:34:22,322 --> 01:34:23,449
Coming along.

1404
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:25,884
Attach #23 to #38.

1405
01:34:27,261 --> 01:34:28,559
- #38.
- Right.

1406
01:34:30,931 --> 01:34:32,593
- Those pants.
- Right.

1407
01:34:41,645 --> 01:34:42,684
What are you doing!

1408
01:34:47,948 --> 01:34:50,611
I just picked it up, really...

1409
01:34:51,984 --> 01:34:52,883
It's hopeless.

1410
01:34:56,857 --> 01:35:01,227
You said it couldn't get any worse!
It's turning into a disaster!

1411
01:35:10,971 --> 01:35:11,995
Let's just give it up.

1412
01:35:15,562 --> 01:35:16,681
I appreciate your spirit.

1413
01:35:17,611 --> 01:35:19,011
Let's find another plank.

1414
01:35:21,715 --> 01:35:23,843
I think I saw one
like it out there.

1415
01:35:24,251 --> 01:35:27,346
Don't be ridiculous!
This isn't just any old wood!

1416
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:37,427
Then substitute a piece of wood
that doesn't show.

1417
01:35:54,014 --> 01:35:54,674
This one?

1418
01:35:54,748 --> 01:35:56,910
That's for the side,
you can't substitute it.

1419
01:35:57,718 --> 01:35:58,549
No good.

1420
01:36:00,821 --> 01:36:01,618
This one?

1421
01:36:11,765 --> 01:36:15,361
You only see #12 when you
open the drawer, it might work.

1422
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:25,636
I think it'll work.

1423
01:36:27,047 --> 01:36:27,974
It works!

1424
01:36:32,986 --> 01:36:34,545
- No.
- Why not?

1425
01:36:35,122 --> 01:36:36,522
Different process.

1426
01:36:39,793 --> 01:36:40,726
Chief?

1427
01:36:43,530 --> 01:36:44,623
It's tongue-in-groove.

1428
01:36:45,842 --> 01:36:46,673
Tongue-in-groove?

1429
01:36:46,759 --> 01:36:50,311
Yeah, see this groove here?

1430
01:36:50,971 --> 01:36:51,734
Yes.

1431
01:36:52,439 --> 01:36:54,738
It's a method called
tongue-in-groove.

1432
01:36:58,445 --> 01:37:01,677
Guess carpenters come up with
the same ideas all over the world.

1433
01:37:03,684 --> 01:37:05,448
Bring my tongue-in-groove tool.

1434
01:37:06,153 --> 01:37:07,086
Sure thing!

1435
01:37:13,093 --> 01:37:14,425
Can you replicate it?

1436
01:37:15,729 --> 01:37:17,425
It has to be identical?

1437
01:37:17,898 --> 01:37:18,816
If possible.

1438
01:37:19,433 --> 01:37:21,834
That'll be tough.

1439
01:37:25,606 --> 01:37:27,837
I've never done such sloppy work.

1440
01:37:30,110 --> 01:37:34,445
Whoever made this piece,
wasn't much of a carpenter.

1441
01:37:42,923 --> 01:37:46,018
What's a tongue-in-groove tool?
I'm sorry...

1442
01:38:02,643 --> 01:38:04,407
But won't this reduce its value?

1443
01:38:05,178 --> 01:38:08,945
Old furniture isn't valuable
because it's old.

1444
01:38:10,017 --> 01:38:13,454
It's been cherished over the years
because it functions.

1445
01:38:14,621 --> 01:38:18,058
When it breaks, you fix it.
It doesn't hurt its value.

1446
01:38:37,577 --> 01:38:39,910
- Get me some varnish.
- Right.

1447
01:38:40,113 --> 01:38:43,606
Regular varnish'll give it
a Japanese sheen.

1448
01:38:44,051 --> 01:38:45,917
Sorry, there's French in the van.

1449
01:38:46,553 --> 01:38:47,851
- French...?
- French polish.

1450
01:39:15,248 --> 01:39:16,546
- Bring that.
- Right.

1451
01:40:02,129 --> 01:40:03,927
Todaiji Temple in Nara...

1452
01:40:04,765 --> 01:40:07,098
has the huge Nandaimon Gate.

1453
01:40:07,968 --> 01:40:09,596
Nandaimon Gate, of course.

1454
01:40:10,871 --> 01:40:13,204
Built in the 8th century, I think.

1455
01:40:13,774 --> 01:40:16,710
It's been restored several times.

1456
01:40:17,811 --> 01:40:20,747
After centuries,
they found an ink pot...

1457
01:40:20,981 --> 01:40:22,813
on one of the crossbeams.

1458
01:40:24,284 --> 01:40:27,948
We're talking
many meters up in the air.

1459
01:40:29,054 --> 01:40:29,911
An ink pot?

1460
01:40:30,757 --> 01:40:31,622
Yeah.

1461
01:40:32,793 --> 01:40:35,627
We use these to mark lumber.

1462
01:40:36,663 --> 01:40:37,596
Right.

1463
01:40:38,698 --> 01:40:40,894
Did a carpenter forget it?

1464
01:40:41,635 --> 01:40:45,299
No one knows the real story.
But the thing is,

1465
01:40:46,273 --> 01:40:48,174
we believe that a carpenter,
whoever he was,

1466
01:40:48,875 --> 01:40:53,210
intentionally left it behind,
you see?

1467
01:40:54,815 --> 01:40:59,776
Proof that he was the one
who built this Gate.

1468
01:41:01,154 --> 01:41:05,615
I get it! Sort of like a painter
signing his painting.

1469
01:41:06,193 --> 01:41:08,287
No, everyone sees a signature,
that's no good.

1470
01:41:12,032 --> 01:41:13,796
The ink pot is a secret...

1471
01:41:16,169 --> 01:41:19,606
between you and God.

1472
01:41:21,808 --> 01:41:24,835
That's the important thing.

1473
01:41:26,079 --> 01:41:30,312
That's the spirit...
of a true carpenter.

1474
01:41:32,652 --> 01:41:33,745
What a great story.

1475
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:41,659
<i>Juraku...</i>

1476
01:41:42,863 --> 01:41:44,297
No line between ceiling and wall.

1477
01:41:45,799 --> 01:41:49,099
It expresses the eternity
of the universe.

1478
01:42:06,333 --> 01:42:07,061
Take a look.

1479
01:42:07,721 --> 01:42:08,745
What? Showing off?

1480
01:42:09,011 --> 01:42:10,120
Hold it to the light.

1481
01:42:12,459 --> 01:42:15,793
You can see right through it!
You're amazing.

1482
01:42:16,463 --> 01:42:18,728
Incredible technique.

1483
01:42:19,699 --> 01:42:21,099
It's like 0.2mm thick.

1484
01:42:22,035 --> 01:42:23,867
Been at it 51 years.

1485
01:42:25,205 --> 01:42:25,934
Excuse me.

1486
01:42:26,806 --> 01:42:27,958
Yanagisawa.

1487
01:42:30,177 --> 01:42:31,138
What are you?

1488
01:42:31,245 --> 01:42:32,838
I can plane a board.

1489
01:42:33,079 --> 01:42:34,240
Yanagisawa.

1490
01:42:35,015 --> 01:42:35,855
Better not.

1491
01:42:40,153 --> 01:42:40,916
Ouch.

1492
01:42:44,891 --> 01:42:47,417
Hey, yours is really thin, too.
Amazing!

1493
01:42:48,361 --> 01:42:49,795
But Father wins.

1494
01:42:50,397 --> 01:42:51,831
If I could use both hands...

1495
01:42:52,499 --> 01:42:55,333
It's plenty impressive,
but Father wins.

1496
01:42:57,370 --> 01:42:58,427
That's impressive.

1497
01:42:58,505 --> 01:42:59,905
Oh, no, that's nothing.

1498
01:43:00,907 --> 01:43:02,136
I'm impressed, too.

1499
01:43:02,242 --> 01:43:03,169
Now it's my turn.

1500
01:43:06,413 --> 01:43:07,400
It's really no good.

1501
01:43:08,415 --> 01:43:09,781
I'm really impressed, you're good.

1502
01:43:15,021 --> 01:43:16,853
- You beat me.
- Oh, not at all.

1503
01:43:17,157 --> 01:43:18,162
Hey, it's stuck.

1504
01:43:22,462 --> 01:43:23,554
I better stop bragging.

1505
01:43:24,464 --> 01:43:25,864
Next time, I'll beat you.

1506
01:43:25,966 --> 01:43:27,144
I swear I won't.

1507
01:43:29,836 --> 01:43:33,500
If only my daughter had
married a guy like you...

1508
01:43:33,940 --> 01:43:34,849
What an honor.

1509
01:43:35,976 --> 01:43:36,773
Who said honor...

1510
01:43:36,843 --> 01:43:37,936
Please, Father, c'mon...

1511
01:43:41,014 --> 01:43:42,448
It was a joke, a joke.

1512
01:43:46,319 --> 01:43:47,437
Why don't you join us?

1513
01:43:48,987 --> 01:43:49,920
Thank you!

1514
01:43:55,528 --> 01:43:56,320
Excuse me.

1515
01:43:56,363 --> 01:43:57,559
After all, it's your house...

1516
01:44:30,897 --> 01:44:31,865
Maestro.

1517
01:44:33,033 --> 01:44:35,195
- Chief, are you sure?
- Yup.

1518
01:44:50,950 --> 01:44:52,179
You, too, maestro.

1519
01:44:57,624 --> 01:44:58,663
Then, this.

1520
01:45:09,636 --> 01:45:10,675
Son-in-law?

1521
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:12,672
Me, too? Sure it's OK?

1522
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:14,870
It's your house.

1523
01:45:16,576 --> 01:45:17,544
Hurry.

1524
01:45:22,582 --> 01:45:23,447
This, then.

1525
01:46:20,069 --> 01:46:21,117
When were you born?

1526
01:46:21,307 --> 01:46:22,468
Hurry.

1527
01:46:22,642 --> 01:46:24,133
Stop running around.

1528
01:46:24,244 --> 01:46:27,874
I've seen you on that TV show.
It's been so long.

1529
01:46:29,716 --> 01:46:31,048
Nice to see you.

1530
01:46:43,263 --> 01:46:45,095
This way, Kent, hurry.

1531
01:46:47,934 --> 01:46:51,666
House-Warming Party

1532
01:46:51,971 --> 01:46:52,529
Cheers!

1533
01:46:53,506 --> 01:46:54,405
Thanks, Tamiko.

1534
01:46:55,008 --> 01:46:55,976
Enjoy yourself.

1535
01:46:56,409 --> 01:46:59,106
Your vegetable sign
is cauliflower...

1536
01:46:59,746 --> 01:47:00,820
Help yourself.

1537
01:47:02,121 --> 01:47:02,944
Your sign?

1538
01:47:03,049 --> 01:47:04,711
Mine is a "Manganji" pepper.

1539
01:47:05,385 --> 01:47:06,478
<i>Manganji?</i>

1540
01:47:06,553 --> 01:47:07,521
Don't you know?

1541
01:47:08,221 --> 01:47:11,919
It's a green pepper,
about this size.

1542
01:47:12,258 --> 01:47:16,093
It's delicious
if you cook it with...

1543
01:47:16,496 --> 01:47:18,522
I'd say the walls are
a little too white.

1544
01:47:19,632 --> 01:47:20,361
Oh, really?

1545
01:47:20,633 --> 01:47:25,196
You'll see once you settle in.
Pure white walls hurt your eyes.

1546
01:47:26,039 --> 01:47:27,166
Terrific, girls.

1547
01:47:28,541 --> 01:47:30,032
Oh, no, don't. Brother!

1548
01:47:30,577 --> 01:47:35,208
Girls, cut it out! No!

1549
01:48:14,053 --> 01:48:16,420
Can I get you anything?
Are you fine?

1550
01:48:16,756 --> 01:48:17,485
Fine.

1551
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:21,557
Thank you.

1552
01:48:53,393 --> 01:48:54,311
Help yourself.

1553
01:48:54,561 --> 01:48:55,256
Thanks.

1554
01:48:55,495 --> 01:48:58,158
I always watch your show.

1555
01:48:58,398 --> 01:48:59,696
And your commercial!

1556
01:49:01,167 --> 01:49:03,466
Your show's coming up.

1557
01:49:04,837 --> 01:49:08,137
Oh, I remember this concept.

1558
01:49:08,675 --> 01:49:09,768
I saw this one.

1559
01:49:10,176 --> 01:49:13,408
You're serious fans.
Makes it hard to recycle ideas.

1560
01:49:13,846 --> 01:49:15,508
Really gotta watch it, OK?

1561
01:49:16,313 --> 01:49:17,283
He turned it off.

1562
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:26,413
You can serve that.

1563
01:49:27,222 --> 01:49:28,288
Yanagisawa go home?

1564
01:49:28,428 --> 01:49:30,124
Oh, perfect. Take this outside?

1565
01:49:31,664 --> 01:49:33,189
- Your father?
- The Japanese room.

1566
01:49:34,300 --> 01:49:35,097
Excuse me.

1567
01:49:36,703 --> 01:49:39,764
Yes, oh, how exquisite.

1568
01:49:41,741 --> 01:49:42,504
Naosuke.

1569
01:49:50,216 --> 01:49:51,455
You did a wonderful job.

1570
01:49:54,787 --> 01:49:56,187
Mom, let me do that.

1571
01:50:09,180 --> 01:50:10,134
Maestro.

1572
01:50:15,642 --> 01:50:17,508
I don't especially like you.

1573
01:50:19,312 --> 01:50:20,507
But I like this house.

1574
01:50:25,164 --> 01:50:26,073
Thank you.

1575
01:50:26,325 --> 01:50:27,425
Nice job.

1576
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:49,738
Eat up, everyone.

1577
01:50:49,876 --> 01:50:51,139
Thank you.

1578
01:50:53,613 --> 01:50:54,774
Have a drink, Naosuke.

1579
01:50:54,914 --> 01:50:55,955
Where's Father?

1580
01:50:56,249 --> 01:50:57,842
Isn't he around? I just saw him.

1581
01:50:59,252 --> 01:51:00,361
Where'd he go?

1582
01:51:02,989 --> 01:51:04,141
Down the hatch.

1583
01:51:04,290 --> 01:51:06,316
Down the hatch? Sure.

1584
01:51:18,356 --> 01:51:19,536
What's next?

1585
01:51:24,243 --> 01:51:25,328
Nothing.

1586
01:51:26,646 --> 01:51:28,877
But some day,
you'll do a big job, right?

1587
01:51:36,556 --> 01:51:38,491
Turned into a great house.

1588
01:51:42,829 --> 01:51:44,422
It certainly did.

1589
01:51:46,032 --> 01:51:47,398
Even if the door opens out.

1590
01:51:49,602 --> 01:51:51,628
Never heard of one opening in.

1591
01:51:52,405 --> 01:51:53,873
Most American homes...

1592
01:51:54,040 --> 01:51:57,477
Who cares. I say doors open out.

1593
01:52:00,012 --> 01:52:01,310
You old fart.

1594
01:52:04,517 --> 01:52:05,849
The Japanese room's too big.

1595
01:52:07,487 --> 01:52:08,853
You've got a point there.

1596
01:52:10,456 --> 01:52:11,822
You knew after all.
