1
00:00:39,153 --> 00:00:41,585
It's based on the novel by Alberto Moravia.

2
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,049
It features Brigitte Bardot and Michel Piccoli.

3
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:55,217
Jack Palance and Giorgia Moll, too.

4
00:00:59,819 --> 00:01:01,410
And Fritz Lang.

5
00:01:06,852 --> 00:01:09,182
Raoul Coutard did the photography.

6
00:01:12,786 --> 00:01:14,979
Georges Delerue wrote the score.

7
00:01:19,053 --> 00:01:21,644
The sound was recorded by William Sivel.

8
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:27,112
Agnes Guillemot did the editing.

9
00:01:30,486 --> 00:01:33,974
Philippe Dussart and Carlo Lastricati were unit managers.

10
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:39,015
It's a film byJean-Luc Godard.

11
00:01:42,652 --> 00:01:46,210
It was shot in CinemaScope and printed in color by GTC Labs.

12
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:51,448
Georges de Beauregard and Carlo Ponti produced it

13
00:01:51,552 --> 00:01:56,678
for Rome-Paris Films, Films Concordia and Compagnia Cinematografia Champion.

14
00:02:05,586 --> 00:02:08,677
"The cinema, "said Andre Bazin, "substitutes for our gaze

15
00:02:08,786 --> 00:02:11,344
a world more in harmony with our desires. "

16
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:16,342
Contempt is a story of that world.

17
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,245
I don't know.

18
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,613
Maybe I'll go to Mom's. I don't know what I'll do later.

19
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,452
Come pick me up if you want.

20
00:02:44,353 --> 00:02:45,818
Around 4 o'clock.

21
00:02:46,652 --> 00:02:48,641
At Cinecitta.

22
00:02:51,153 --> 00:02:53,778
I have to see that American.

23
00:02:56,153 --> 00:02:57,982
Maybe I will.

24
00:03:01,953 --> 00:03:04,044
See my feet in the mirror?

25
00:03:08,752 --> 00:03:10,378
Think they're pretty?

26
00:03:11,886 --> 00:03:13,476
Very.

27
00:03:14,886 --> 00:03:17,478
You like my ankles?

28
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,881
And my knees, too?

29
00:03:28,619 --> 00:03:30,518
I really like your knees.

30
00:03:33,486 --> 00:03:35,542
And my thighs?

31
00:03:37,686 --> 00:03:39,448
Your thighs, too.

32
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,083
See my behind in the mirror?

33
00:03:54,686 --> 00:03:57,482
Do you think I have a cute ass?

34
00:04:01,186 --> 00:04:02,947
Really.

35
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:07,308
Shall I get on my knees?

36
00:04:10,486 --> 00:04:12,111
No need to.

37
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:15,376
And my breasts. You like them?

38
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:19,077
Yes, tremendously.

39
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,144
Gently, Paul. Not so hard.

40
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:27,744
Sorry.

41
00:04:29,452 --> 00:04:31,316
Which do you like better,

42
00:04:32,053 --> 00:04:33,484
my breasts,

43
00:04:34,286 --> 00:04:36,547
or my nipples?

44
00:04:39,253 --> 00:04:42,310
I don't know. I like them the same.

45
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:48,349
You like my shoulders?

46
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:54,251
I don't think they're round enough.

47
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,851
And my arms?

48
00:05:10,452 --> 00:05:12,350
And my face?

49
00:05:15,352 --> 00:05:17,080
Your face, too.

50
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:18,742
All of it?

51
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:22,648
My mouth, my eyes, my nose, my ears?

52
00:05:23,586 --> 00:05:25,143
Yes, everything.

53
00:05:27,352 --> 00:05:29,477
Then you love me totally.

54
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:37,216
I love you totally, tenderly, tragically.

55
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,083
Me too, Paul.

56
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:47,878
- Hello. How are you? - Fine, thanks.

57
00:05:47,986 --> 00:05:50,384
Say, what's going on here? The place is empty!

58
00:05:50,485 --> 00:05:52,678
Jerry fired nearly everybody.

59
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,114
Italian cinema is in trouble.

60
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,913
- Where is he? - Over there.

61
00:05:59,053 --> 00:06:00,609
Where?

62
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:17,447
It's the end of cinema.

63
00:07:19,153 --> 00:07:21,176
I don't think cinema will ever die.

64
00:07:30,752 --> 00:07:33,377
- It's doing good business in N.Y. - Fair to middling.

65
00:07:47,186 --> 00:07:48,845
Your film with Fritz Lang?

66
00:07:54,086 --> 00:07:55,711
He's not working out.

67
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:37,212
Producers never know what they want.

68
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,952
In '33, Goebbels asked Lang to head the German film industry.

69
00:09:21,053 --> 00:09:23,575
That very night, Lang left Germany.

70
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,279
That's Minerva, isn't it?

71
00:12:36,786 --> 00:12:38,910
She's Ulysses' protector.

72
00:12:42,385 --> 00:12:45,749
And that's Neptune, his mortal enemy.

73
00:13:52,485 --> 00:13:54,474
Say, that's Homer.

74
00:14:25,252 --> 00:14:28,184
That's art, but will the public understand?

75
00:14:39,185 --> 00:14:40,651
Who's that?

76
00:14:40,752 --> 00:14:42,240
Penelope.

77
00:15:14,719 --> 00:15:18,481
"O my brothers, who braved 1 00,000 perils

78
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:20,944
to reach the west,

79
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:24,242
choose not to deny experience

80
00:15:24,452 --> 00:15:26,611
of the unpeopled world.

81
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,681
Think of the seed of your creation.

82
00:15:29,818 --> 00:15:32,410
You were not born to live as brutes,

83
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,451
but to follow virtue and knowledge."

84
00:15:38,586 --> 00:15:40,074
Know it?

85
00:15:40,185 --> 00:15:43,049
Sure, it's very famous. Dante.

86
00:15:45,718 --> 00:15:48,241
"Night then saw all the stars.

87
00:15:58,452 --> 00:16:02,544
We were filled with gladness, which soon turned to tears

88
00:16:05,452 --> 00:16:07,917
until the sea closed in upon us."

89
00:17:11,818 --> 00:17:14,875
I'm PaulJaval. Mr. Prokosch told you...

90
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:16,746
I'm perfectly aware.

91
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,149
It looks swell. I really like CinemaScope.

92
00:17:20,586 --> 00:17:22,484
It wasn't made for people.

93
00:17:22,586 --> 00:17:25,949
It's only good for snakes and funerals.

94
00:17:49,918 --> 00:17:53,146
What's the matter, Miss Vanini? Is it about the script?

95
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:27,916
Oh, he's says it's not the same on screen as on paper.

96
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:45,444
My wife's meeting me here. I'll go see.

97
00:19:00,452 --> 00:19:03,475
The Italians used to say "revolver"

98
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,041
instead of"checkbook."

99
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:05,716
"But Man, when he must,

100
00:20:06,052 --> 00:20:08,018
Can stand fearless and alone before God

101
00:20:08,918 --> 00:20:10,679
His candor is his shield

102
00:20:11,352 --> 00:20:14,079
He needs neither arms nor wile

103
00:20:14,285 --> 00:20:17,308
Until such time as God's absence helps him."

104
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:18,775
Fine.

105
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,215
That's Holderlin, isn't it?

106
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:24,183
"The Poet's Vocation."

107
00:20:24,918 --> 00:20:28,680
The final line is obscure. Holderlin originally wrote...

108
00:20:33,352 --> 00:20:35,579
"So long as God is not absent."

109
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:38,348
And then...

110
00:20:42,018 --> 00:20:43,847
"So long as God is close to us."

111
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:48,684
Yes. The way the last lines are written,

112
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:51,217
when you've read the other two,

113
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:55,450
is no longer about God's presence.

114
00:20:56,018 --> 00:20:58,779
It's God's absence that reassures Man.

115
00:20:59,518 --> 00:21:02,848
Strange, but true.

116
00:21:04,285 --> 00:21:07,274
How do you say "strange" in Italian?

117
00:22:01,384 --> 00:22:04,976
Meet Mr. Prokosch. Camille, my wife.

118
00:22:13,918 --> 00:22:16,043
I'd like you to meet my wife, Camille.

119
00:22:19,718 --> 00:22:22,912
He's the one who did that western with Dietrich.

120
00:22:23,018 --> 00:22:24,643
It was terrific!

121
00:22:24,751 --> 00:22:26,308
I prefer M.

122
00:22:26,418 --> 00:22:27,406
Your M?

123
00:22:27,518 --> 00:22:30,507
We just saw it on TV. I really liked it.

124
00:22:30,718 --> 00:22:32,946
Thank you. That's kind of you.

125
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:36,109
I love the scene

126
00:22:36,219 --> 00:22:38,810
when Ferrer leans on the scale.

127
00:22:39,152 --> 00:22:41,913
Thank you. When I finish The Odyssey...

128
00:22:59,918 --> 00:23:01,316
Me?

129
00:23:13,585 --> 00:23:15,312
I'll phone you.

130
00:23:23,451 --> 00:23:25,508
We'll go if you want.

131
00:23:28,985 --> 00:23:30,382
Sit down, ma'am.

132
00:23:34,685 --> 00:23:36,651
I'll meet you there.

133
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,578
I'll grab a taxi.

134
00:23:41,685 --> 00:23:44,674
Let him go on ahead. We can both take a cab.

135
00:23:45,318 --> 00:23:47,046
Make up your mind.

136
00:24:33,384 --> 00:24:35,475
What's the address?

137
00:25:45,751 --> 00:25:47,273
What did he say?

138
00:25:47,651 --> 00:25:49,913
I know as much English as you do.

139
00:25:55,018 --> 00:25:59,245
We've been waiting a half hour. What kept you?

140
00:26:10,718 --> 00:26:12,479
Nothing. I had an accident...

141
00:26:13,618 --> 00:26:17,209
I was in the cab, and just at the corner...

142
00:26:17,585 --> 00:26:20,847
the "corner" of the street...

143
00:26:22,152 --> 00:26:23,913
Two cars, you know...

144
00:26:24,018 --> 00:26:26,415
The entire fender was torn off.

145
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:29,916
The two drivers started trading insults...

146
00:26:33,418 --> 00:26:35,748
So I found another cab. That's why...

147
00:26:35,851 --> 00:26:37,749
That's why, what?

148
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:41,583
What? Why I got here late.

149
00:26:42,418 --> 00:26:45,112
I had to walk God knows how long...

150
00:26:45,518 --> 00:26:48,712
From S. Angelo to Piazza Venezia to find a cab.

151
00:27:03,618 --> 00:27:07,641
Anyway, I don't give a damn. I'm not interested in your story.

152
00:27:12,718 --> 00:27:14,843
Still, it took me 20 minutes.

153
00:27:19,052 --> 00:27:22,347
You don't believe me. - We'll discuss it later.

154
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:25,984
I'm going for a walk.

155
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:11,341
All right.

156
00:28:13,585 --> 00:28:15,608
Why don't you say something?

157
00:29:01,718 --> 00:29:04,946
Friday we shoot in Capri. Come with us.

158
00:29:06,451 --> 00:29:10,110
Answer her. Why don't you speak up?

159
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:16,148
What were you doing before I arrived?

160
00:29:16,251 --> 00:29:18,080
Nothing special.

161
00:29:18,484 --> 00:29:20,643
Why? Did he come on to you?

162
00:29:23,318 --> 00:29:25,614
- Why ask me that? - Just because.

163
00:29:33,484 --> 00:29:35,313
I'll go wash my hands.

164
00:29:43,351 --> 00:29:46,215
- Where can I wash? - Upstairs, right.

165
00:29:54,718 --> 00:29:56,809
What's the matter? You look down.

166
00:29:57,851 --> 00:29:59,407
Nothing.

167
00:30:01,284 --> 00:30:02,977
Have you been crying?

168
00:30:06,318 --> 00:30:08,011
Your boss is tough.

169
00:30:09,751 --> 00:30:11,239
He is.

170
00:30:13,884 --> 00:30:15,941
Known him long?

171
00:30:20,384 --> 00:30:22,646
What did he do before movies?

172
00:30:23,718 --> 00:30:25,707
I don't want to talk about it.

173
00:30:27,017 --> 00:30:28,846
I was just asking.

174
00:30:31,184 --> 00:30:34,207
It's a drag to be so cute and so sad.

175
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:37,475
Haven't you anything more amusing to say?

176
00:30:39,117 --> 00:30:40,674
More amusing...

177
00:30:43,618 --> 00:30:45,083
Ajoke.

178
00:30:47,484 --> 00:30:48,848
Which one?

179
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:56,274
Sure, the one about Rama Krishna and his disciple.

180
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:06,274
Rama Krishna is a Hindu sage.

181
00:31:07,051 --> 00:31:09,176
He has this disciple

182
00:31:09,984 --> 00:31:12,712
who doesn't believe in his master's teachings.

183
00:31:14,218 --> 00:31:16,480
He decides to study on his own.

184
00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:18,380
So he goes away.

185
00:31:19,384 --> 00:31:23,180
After 1 5 years, he comes back and says: "I've found it!"

186
00:31:23,951 --> 00:31:25,417
Found what?

187
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:28,814
He tells the sage: "I'll show you."

188
00:31:28,917 --> 00:31:31,247
He takes him to the riverbank.

189
00:31:32,151 --> 00:31:35,913
The disciple walks back and forth across the water.

190
00:31:37,084 --> 00:31:40,914
And he says: "You see? I can cross without getting wet.

191
00:31:41,384 --> 00:31:43,111
Now I know!"

192
00:31:44,651 --> 00:31:46,480
So Rama Krishna replies:

193
00:31:47,585 --> 00:31:51,540
"You fool! I did that 1 0 years ago with a rupee and a rowboat!"

194
00:31:57,685 --> 00:31:59,207
Feel better now?

195
00:32:01,017 --> 00:32:02,643
That's good.

196
00:32:04,351 --> 00:32:05,647
What?

197
00:32:09,051 --> 00:32:10,677
Call that washing your hands?

198
00:32:10,784 --> 00:32:12,273
As you can see.

199
00:32:13,618 --> 00:32:15,913
I was just telling her the joke...

200
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,983
I believe you already.

201
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,341
You're being an idiot.

202
00:32:21,618 --> 00:32:23,277
Where can I pee?

203
00:33:54,017 --> 00:33:55,983
Tell them we're leaving.

204
00:34:21,451 --> 00:34:23,280
It's my husband who decides.

205
00:34:50,884 --> 00:34:53,350
Like in the United Artists days.

206
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:32,876
He's crazy!

207
00:35:32,984 --> 00:35:34,950
See that? He kicked her!

208
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:41,317
You change your mind fast. Monday you thought he was terrific.

209
00:35:50,117 --> 00:35:52,242
Now I think he's a jerk.

210
00:35:54,184 --> 00:35:56,047
I have a right to change my mind.

211
00:36:02,084 --> 00:36:04,175
What happened in the past hour?

212
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,339
Nothing.

213
00:36:06,717 --> 00:36:08,649
If you're happy, so am I.

214
00:36:34,184 --> 00:36:36,581
Rio Bravo is playing in town.

215
00:36:40,251 --> 00:36:42,808
So is Nicholas Ray's Bigger Than Life.

216
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:44,780
I'm not interested.

217
00:36:46,884 --> 00:36:49,214
- I wrote it. - I know.

218
00:36:52,284 --> 00:36:55,716
I phoned your mom's at lunchtime. There was no answer.

219
00:36:56,151 --> 00:36:59,117
We ate here. I didn't feel like going out.

220
00:37:04,617 --> 00:37:06,243
I prefer it here.

221
00:37:07,218 --> 00:37:09,081
It's better than a hotel.

222
00:37:09,184 --> 00:37:11,207
See? I was right.

223
00:37:13,951 --> 00:37:16,349
What are they paying for the script?

224
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:19,279
$1 0,000. Six million lire.

225
00:37:20,418 --> 00:37:23,815
We can finish paying off the flat. Isn't that great?

226
00:37:24,817 --> 00:37:26,840
Yes, it's great.

227
00:37:37,984 --> 00:37:41,007
When will you call your friend about the curtains?

228
00:37:41,351 --> 00:37:43,249
I've about had it!

229
00:37:43,351 --> 00:37:45,340
Once he's back from Spain.

230
00:37:45,984 --> 00:37:48,382
Roberto said he'd be back Friday.

231
00:37:54,084 --> 00:37:57,073
Red velvet. It's that or nothing.

232
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,374
Okay.

233
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:02,575
Set the table while I take a bath?

234
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:06,146
I wanted to take a bath, too.

235
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:09,183
You go first. I can do some work.

236
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:15,914
No, I'll go later, while it's cooking.

237
00:38:17,051 --> 00:38:19,108
Is there any faggiolini left?

238
00:38:22,584 --> 00:38:24,709
Don't like it? That's tough.

239
00:38:25,084 --> 00:38:27,016
I can set the table.

240
00:38:27,117 --> 00:38:28,844
I was just doing it.

241
00:39:08,951 --> 00:39:11,542
I bought something today.

242
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,775
You'll tell me what you think.

243
00:39:14,684 --> 00:39:16,173
What thing?

244
00:39:23,218 --> 00:39:24,649
What thing?

245
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,907
Don't look yet.

246
00:39:27,151 --> 00:39:28,912
You want to go to Capri?

247
00:39:37,218 --> 00:39:38,774
What?

248
00:39:38,884 --> 00:39:41,146
You want us to go to Capri?

249
00:39:45,684 --> 00:39:48,445
I won't say no, but I won't say yes either.

250
00:39:48,584 --> 00:39:50,812
It would be a vacation.

251
00:39:53,218 --> 00:39:55,376
Besides, he didn't invite me.

252
00:39:56,051 --> 00:39:57,516
What?

253
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:01,713
He invited you.

254
00:40:02,717 --> 00:40:04,512
Not me.

255
00:40:11,017 --> 00:40:13,074
Where'd we put the mirror?

256
00:40:32,084 --> 00:40:34,276
Not at all. We were both invited.

257
00:40:37,084 --> 00:40:38,709
Look.

258
00:40:42,784 --> 00:40:44,647
Doesn't it suit me?

259
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,909
No, I prefer you as a blonde.

260
00:40:47,218 --> 00:40:49,877
And I prefer you without a hat and cigar.

261
00:40:51,117 --> 00:40:55,412
It's just to look like Dean Martin in Some Came Running.

262
00:40:57,483 --> 00:40:59,881
- What a laugh! - What is?

263
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:03,581
You may want to look like Dean Martin,

264
00:41:03,884 --> 00:41:06,645
but it's more like Martin's Ass.

265
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,375
Who's that?

266
00:41:08,483 --> 00:41:11,075
Never read the adventures of Martin's Ass?

267
00:41:13,517 --> 00:41:17,176
One day he goes to Baghdad to buy a flying carpet.

268
00:41:18,283 --> 00:41:20,647
He finds this really pretty one,

269
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:25,048
so he sits on it, but it doesn't fly.

270
00:41:25,218 --> 00:41:27,581
The merchant says: "Not surprising."

271
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:29,542
Are you listening?

272
00:41:31,317 --> 00:41:32,977
"Not surprising.

273
00:41:33,084 --> 00:41:35,948
If you want it to fly, you mustn't think of an ass."

274
00:41:36,317 --> 00:41:39,613
So Martin says: "Okay, I won't think of an ass."

275
00:41:40,283 --> 00:41:44,443
But automatically he thinks of one, so the carpet doesn't fly.

276
00:41:45,283 --> 00:41:46,840
What's that got to do with me?

277
00:41:49,117 --> 00:41:51,309
Exactly what I was saying.

278
00:41:51,917 --> 00:41:53,712
Well, I don't get it.

279
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:00,916
That's enough. Are you finished?

280
00:42:01,917 --> 00:42:04,610
No need to change the water. I didn't use soap.

281
00:42:14,184 --> 00:42:17,911
You've been acting weird today. What's wrong?

282
00:42:18,051 --> 00:42:19,641
Nothing at all.

283
00:42:21,217 --> 00:42:23,410
I knew you'd say that.

284
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,576
There is something. Is it that girl?

285
00:42:28,283 --> 00:42:32,773
It's nothing, I tell you. I simply said you were an ass.

286
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,478
Not the same sound all over.

287
00:42:44,517 --> 00:42:47,108
Why don't you want us to go to Capri?

288
00:42:49,717 --> 00:42:51,615
Because you're an ass.

289
00:42:59,984 --> 00:43:02,007
You frighten me, Paul.

290
00:43:03,884 --> 00:43:06,146
It's not the first time.

291
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,875
Why didn't you answer instead of standing there?

292
00:43:09,984 --> 00:43:12,745
Why'd I marry a 28-year-old typist?

293
00:43:14,917 --> 00:43:16,542
It's true...

294
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,478
I'm sorry.

295
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:23,843
So am I.

296
00:43:37,017 --> 00:43:40,881
Go to Capri if you want. I don't feel like it.

297
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:46,908
Besides, I don't like thatJeremy Prokosch. I told you.

298
00:43:47,784 --> 00:43:50,375
Why? He do something to you?

299
00:43:52,317 --> 00:43:53,510
Not a thing.

300
00:44:08,617 --> 00:44:10,879
Why the thoughtful air?

301
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:15,272
Maybe because I'm thinking of something.

302
00:44:18,116 --> 00:44:19,673
That surprise you?

303
00:44:19,784 --> 00:44:21,374
No. Why?

304
00:44:23,217 --> 00:44:24,410
An idea.

305
00:44:24,517 --> 00:44:27,210
Come with me. I don't want to go alone.

306
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:30,616
You've been acting funny since we met that guy.

307
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:37,278
No, I'm not funny.

308
00:44:42,483 --> 00:44:44,813
I wonder why you say that.

309
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:46,640
Just because.

310
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:48,906
We were fine this morning.

311
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:51,882
And now we're fighting over nothing.

312
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:55,106
What's going on, sweetie?

313
00:44:55,217 --> 00:44:58,672
I want to have fun. Nothing's going on, Paul.

314
00:45:00,116 --> 00:45:02,446
I'm afraid I'll get bored there.

315
00:45:04,016 --> 00:45:05,744
I'm not going.

316
00:45:07,016 --> 00:45:08,846
I'm not going.

317
00:45:25,884 --> 00:45:28,247
Seen the house being built across the way?

318
00:45:31,317 --> 00:45:33,010
It's a real horror.

319
00:45:35,317 --> 00:45:38,078
If you love me, just be quiet.

320
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:49,207
A husband has the right to know why his wife's sulking.

321
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:54,683
I'm sure it's that girl.

322
00:45:54,784 --> 00:45:56,306
Drop dead!

323
00:46:19,517 --> 00:46:21,244
No, Camille isn't here.

324
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:26,514
I thought you'd lunched out and gone shopping.

325
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:33,082
She just walked in the door! Your mom.

326
00:47:17,916 --> 00:47:19,780
I'll call you tomorrow.

327
00:47:21,116 --> 00:47:23,309
You're out of your mind, old man!

328
00:47:24,617 --> 00:47:26,708
Why tell Mom I was out?

329
00:47:27,617 --> 00:47:29,207
I don't know why.

330
00:47:29,517 --> 00:47:30,744
I know why.

331
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:34,580
To find out if we really went out to lunch

332
00:47:34,684 --> 00:47:37,081
and if I wasn't lying earlier.

333
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:39,840
That's it.

334
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:42,610
Try that again and I'll divorce you.

335
00:47:44,816 --> 00:47:46,339
Get up!

336
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:48,211
What are you doing?

337
00:47:50,183 --> 00:47:52,445
I'm sleeping on the couch.

338
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:54,676
When, tonight?

339
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:58,880
Every night, starting tonight.

340
00:48:09,116 --> 00:48:11,378
Don't be angry.

341
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:14,345
I just can't sleep with the window open.

342
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:17,416
We'll close the window.

343
00:48:18,517 --> 00:48:22,040
You always say you can't breathe. No, we'll sleep apart.

344
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:25,147
Thousands of couples do it.

345
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:27,341
They still get along fine.

346
00:48:28,116 --> 00:48:31,105
What did I do wrong? Tell me.

347
00:48:33,483 --> 00:48:37,313
I'm sorry I said you were out. Is that it? Forgive me.

348
00:48:37,417 --> 00:48:38,939
Let me by.

349
00:48:41,083 --> 00:48:43,140
Is that why you're in a bad mood?

350
00:48:43,517 --> 00:48:45,608
Yes, but I'm not anymore.

351
00:48:48,417 --> 00:48:50,780
I'll be just fine here.

352
00:48:52,517 --> 00:48:54,642
I really wonder what I did.

353
00:49:01,684 --> 00:49:03,876
You're so mean all of a sudden!

354
00:49:04,784 --> 00:49:06,044
Me?

355
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:08,082
I'm the same as always.

356
00:49:10,483 --> 00:49:12,778
You're the one who's changed.

357
00:49:18,849 --> 00:49:21,680
Ever since you've been with movie people.

358
00:49:23,517 --> 00:49:26,074
You used to write crime novels.

359
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:28,772
We didn't have much money,

360
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:32,076
but everything was fine.

361
00:49:39,883 --> 00:49:42,441
What's this? - Give me that.

362
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:45,175
"Partito Comunista Italiano. "

363
00:49:46,217 --> 00:49:48,206
You never said you joined.

364
00:49:48,317 --> 00:49:51,374
That was two months ago in Paris.

365
00:49:51,483 --> 00:49:53,948
Give me that. - Let go! You'll bruise me.

366
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:56,448
- Don't talk to me like that! - And don't you either!

367
00:49:57,116 --> 00:50:00,708
I'm working for you. This place is for you, not just for me!

368
00:50:00,816 --> 00:50:04,044
Please, Paul, I don't want to argue.

369
00:50:15,083 --> 00:50:17,379
I don't want to go to Capri, either.

370
00:50:18,283 --> 00:50:21,272
Why not? Don't be stupid. Go.

371
00:50:28,016 --> 00:50:31,210
Paul, come here.

372
00:50:31,317 --> 00:50:32,408
What?

373
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:36,409
No, I've lost interest.

374
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:39,576
Tell Prokosch when he calls. I won't talk to him.

375
00:50:43,616 --> 00:50:45,139
Come here.

376
00:50:48,483 --> 00:50:51,176
Why won't you do the script now?

377
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:57,177
I'd have done it out of love for you.

378
00:51:00,116 --> 00:51:02,809
But you don't love me anymore.

379
00:51:03,849 --> 00:51:05,781
That's news!

380
00:51:11,849 --> 00:51:15,373
"I hosted a skin contest among three beauties.

381
00:51:16,283 --> 00:51:18,511
They asked me to be the judge.

382
00:51:19,016 --> 00:51:21,743
They showed me their dazzling nudity.

383
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:25,548
The first had a gently curving back

384
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,513
with round dimples.

385
00:51:27,616 --> 00:51:29,912
The second parted her legs, her snow-white skin

386
00:51:30,016 --> 00:51:33,005
grew cherry-red, not crimson.

387
00:51:33,116 --> 00:51:36,276
The third was as still as a quiet sea.

388
00:51:36,383 --> 00:51:39,474
Her delicate skin rippled gently,

389
00:51:39,584 --> 00:51:42,379
shivering involuntarily."

390
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:49,339
We'll just mortgage the flat when we run out of money.

391
00:51:52,383 --> 00:51:55,315
Something makes you think I've stopped loving you?

392
00:51:57,283 --> 00:51:58,578
Yes.

393
00:52:00,916 --> 00:52:02,473
What?

394
00:52:06,417 --> 00:52:07,939
Everything.

395
00:52:08,317 --> 00:52:10,646
But what, for instance?

396
00:52:15,649 --> 00:52:17,740
First tell me if it's true.

397
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:20,973
No, you tell me first.

398
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:25,148
What makes me think you've stopped loving me?

399
00:52:25,616 --> 00:52:27,946
The way you've begun to talk to me.

400
00:52:29,516 --> 00:52:31,982
You weren't like that this morning.

401
00:52:37,916 --> 00:52:39,643
Or yesterday.

402
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:45,412
It's the way you look at me, too.

403
00:52:53,783 --> 00:52:56,272
"The problem, in my opinion,

404
00:52:56,383 --> 00:52:59,974
is in our conception of the world.

405
00:53:00,417 --> 00:53:03,247
A positive view or a negative one.

406
00:53:03,716 --> 00:53:06,205
Greek tragedy was negative

407
00:53:06,317 --> 00:53:09,612
in that it made Man a victim of Fate,

408
00:53:09,716 --> 00:53:11,614
as embodied by the Gods,

409
00:53:11,716 --> 00:53:15,149
who abandoned him to a hopeless destiny."

410
00:53:17,383 --> 00:53:19,644
Why'd you say it was the open window?

411
00:53:21,016 --> 00:53:22,879
There's something else.

412
00:53:25,583 --> 00:53:27,516
I think so.

413
00:53:28,716 --> 00:53:32,876
"Man can rebel against things that are bad, false.

414
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:38,314
We must rebel when we're trapped by circumstances, conventions.

415
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:42,576
But I don't think murder is a solution.

416
00:53:43,649 --> 00:53:46,343
Crimes of passion serve no purpose.

417
00:53:46,749 --> 00:53:51,409
I love a woman, she cheats on me, I kill her.

418
00:53:52,116 --> 00:53:54,207
What's left for me?

419
00:53:54,317 --> 00:53:56,748
I lost the one I love, since she's dead.

420
00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:01,278
If I kill her lover, she hates me, and I still lose her.

421
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:04,972
Killing is never a solution."

422
00:54:06,549 --> 00:54:08,482
Look, Camille...

423
00:54:08,783 --> 00:54:11,408
I'm telling you, I give you my word,

424
00:54:11,516 --> 00:54:13,846
I can't sleep with the window open.

425
00:54:15,116 --> 00:54:19,071
I need peace and quiet and darkness.

426
00:54:20,649 --> 00:54:22,774
I swear it's true.

427
00:54:27,382 --> 00:54:30,644
And you move around too much. You keep waking me.

428
00:54:31,183 --> 00:54:33,478
I want to sleep alone from now on.

429
00:54:35,683 --> 00:54:37,672
You don't want to make love?

430
00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:43,644
Listen to the jerk.

431
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:48,247
Is that a mocking smile or a tender smile?

432
00:54:50,416 --> 00:54:52,905
A tender smile.

433
00:54:55,849 --> 00:54:57,678
So, answer me!

434
00:54:57,783 --> 00:54:59,976
If it were true, I'd tell you.

435
00:55:00,083 --> 00:55:03,537
A woman can always find an excuse not to make love.

436
00:55:03,749 --> 00:55:05,715
But you're really a jerk.

437
00:55:06,583 --> 00:55:08,811
Vulgar language doesn't suit you.

438
00:55:10,183 --> 00:55:12,149
It doesn't suit me?

439
00:55:14,849 --> 00:55:16,508
Listen to this...

440
00:55:18,083 --> 00:55:19,571
Asshole.

441
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:21,604
Cunt.

442
00:55:22,283 --> 00:55:23,942
Shit.

443
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:27,145
Christ almighty.

444
00:55:28,683 --> 00:55:30,444
Craphole.

445
00:55:31,816 --> 00:55:33,714
Son of a bitch.

446
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:37,073
Goddamn.

447
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:43,506
So,

448
00:55:43,616 --> 00:55:45,878
still think it doesn't suit me?

449
00:56:10,649 --> 00:56:12,774
Why don't you want to make love anymore?

450
00:56:22,716 --> 00:56:24,306
All right.

451
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:27,877
Let's do it, but fast.

452
00:56:30,983 --> 00:56:33,881
I'd been thinking Camille could leave me.

453
00:56:33,983 --> 00:56:36,142
I thought of it as a possible disaster.

454
00:56:36,549 --> 00:56:38,515
Now the disaster had happened.

455
00:56:40,217 --> 00:56:43,910
We used to live in a cloud of unawareness,

456
00:56:44,549 --> 00:56:46,674
in delicious complicity.

457
00:56:46,983 --> 00:56:51,779
Things happened with sudden, wild, enchanted recklessness.

458
00:56:52,316 --> 00:56:57,374
I'd end up in Paul's arms, hardly aware of what had happened.

459
00:56:58,449 --> 00:57:03,314
This recklessness was now absent in Camille, and thus in me.

460
00:57:04,016 --> 00:57:08,142
Could I now, prey to my excited senses, observe her coldly,

461
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:10,943
as she could undoubtedly observe me?

462
00:57:12,282 --> 00:57:14,714
I deliberately made that remark

463
00:57:14,816 --> 00:57:17,248
with a secret feeling of revenge.

464
00:57:17,883 --> 00:57:20,940
She seemed aware that a lie could settle things.

465
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:23,481
For a while, at least.

466
00:57:23,849 --> 00:57:26,212
She was clearly tempted to lie.

467
00:57:27,016 --> 00:57:29,538
But on second thought, she decided not to.

468
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:32,182
Paul hurt me so much.

469
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:35,680
It was my turn now, by referring to what I'd seen,

470
00:57:35,916 --> 00:57:38,041
without really being specific.

471
00:57:40,349 --> 00:57:41,975
At heart, I was wrong.

472
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:45,378
She wasn't unfaithful, or she only seemed to be.

473
00:57:45,482 --> 00:57:49,972
The truth remained to be proven, despite appearances.

474
00:57:51,683 --> 00:57:54,615
I've noticed that the more we doubt,

475
00:57:54,716 --> 00:57:57,511
the more we cling to a false lucidity,

476
00:57:57,616 --> 00:58:03,072
in the hope of rationalizing what feelings have made murky.

477
00:58:04,616 --> 00:58:07,139
I thought Camille could leave me.

478
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,238
I thought of it as a possible disaster.

479
00:58:09,349 --> 00:58:11,440
Now the disaster had happened.

480
00:58:11,883 --> 00:58:16,111
We used to live in a cloud of unawareness,

481
00:58:16,282 --> 00:58:17,908
in delicious complicity.

482
00:58:20,316 --> 00:58:21,907
Don't be like that.

483
00:58:26,916 --> 00:58:28,848
Don't be like what?

484
00:58:29,716 --> 00:58:31,511
You know very well.

485
00:58:37,449 --> 00:58:39,075
It's your fault!

486
00:58:48,182 --> 00:58:51,842
You seem to be searching my expression to decide...

487
00:58:53,816 --> 00:58:57,078
the appropriate attitude to take with me.

488
00:59:03,016 --> 00:59:06,470
"The private plane awaited in the blue sky.

489
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:13,174
Rex remembered something about Paula...

490
00:59:13,282 --> 00:59:15,840
Her harmonious features...

491
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:21,639
Her harmonious features, now indecisive, seemed contorted now.

492
00:59:21,883 --> 00:59:24,246
Rex knew this trait of hers,

493
00:59:24,482 --> 00:59:27,108
for it seemed that whenever Paula...

494
00:59:28,349 --> 00:59:31,509
Whenever Paula had to make a decision...

495
00:59:42,449 --> 00:59:44,972
that went against her nature..."

496
00:59:47,349 --> 00:59:49,212
What's got into you, Paul?

497
00:59:49,316 --> 00:59:51,305
I love you exactly as before.

498
01:00:07,783 --> 01:00:11,146
What would you do if I stopped loving you?

499
01:00:11,783 --> 01:00:13,408
I already told you.

500
01:00:14,116 --> 01:00:15,775
I forgot what you said.

501
01:00:16,449 --> 01:00:19,313
I wouldn't do the script and we'd sell the flat.

502
01:00:28,749 --> 01:00:30,578
But I love you.

503
01:00:30,816 --> 01:00:33,112
I find this all so idiotic.

504
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:39,712
When Prokosch calls, tell him you'll go to Capri.

505
01:00:53,649 --> 01:00:55,171
What about you?

506
01:00:55,282 --> 01:00:57,578
I love you. Don't make me repeat it.

507
01:00:58,182 --> 01:01:00,273
I want to keep the flat.

508
01:01:01,583 --> 01:01:04,276
If you don't want to do the script, don't do it.

509
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:09,109
If you think I've stopped loving you, you're wrong.

510
01:01:12,149 --> 01:01:13,911
Kiss me.

511
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,916
We were just talking about you.

512
01:01:52,482 --> 01:01:54,311
About your movie.

513
01:01:57,416 --> 01:01:59,541
Yes, The Odyssey.

514
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:01,706
About that guy who travels.

515
01:02:03,416 --> 01:02:05,177
In Capri,

516
01:02:06,416 --> 01:02:08,814
can we go swimming?

517
01:02:13,282 --> 01:02:14,908
I don't know.

518
01:02:19,549 --> 01:02:23,106
Here's Paul. I'll put him on.

519
01:02:53,449 --> 01:02:55,108
We eating out?

520
01:02:55,216 --> 01:02:57,739
I don't feel like going down for groceries.

521
01:03:04,249 --> 01:03:05,942
Fine.

522
01:03:06,049 --> 01:03:09,072
We're supposed to meet Prokosch and Lang at a movie theater.

523
01:03:09,616 --> 01:03:12,411
They want to see a singer in the stage show.

524
01:03:12,516 --> 01:03:14,106
We can eat after.

525
01:03:14,216 --> 01:03:16,341
It'll be late if there's a movie first.

526
01:03:17,082 --> 01:03:19,548
It might give me some ideas.

527
01:03:24,949 --> 01:03:29,314
Why not look for ideas in your head, instead of stealing them?

528
01:03:29,749 --> 01:03:31,941
What's got into you?

529
01:03:34,282 --> 01:03:35,771
Let's get going!

530
01:03:35,882 --> 01:03:38,144
- I knew it. - What?

531
01:03:38,249 --> 01:03:41,181
Since I said yes to Prokosch, so long tenderness!

532
01:03:42,115 --> 01:03:44,377
Right, no more caresses.

533
01:03:45,616 --> 01:03:47,912
What was the phone call about?

534
01:03:48,716 --> 01:03:52,079
- Our going to Capri. - What did you say?

535
01:03:52,616 --> 01:03:54,605
That it was up to you.

536
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:57,544
Are you nuts?

537
01:03:58,182 --> 01:04:01,546
You know that it's up to you, not me!

538
01:04:02,216 --> 01:04:04,011
Then come to Capri.

539
01:04:06,449 --> 01:04:08,846
Is there something between you and Prokosch?

540
01:04:10,416 --> 01:04:12,245
You're pathetic.

541
01:04:20,216 --> 01:04:22,148
I have to talk to you.

542
01:04:22,249 --> 01:04:24,147
What, about the movies?

543
01:04:25,049 --> 01:04:27,311
Listen, I have to talk to you.

544
01:04:30,549 --> 01:04:33,174
All right, I'm listening.

545
01:04:34,349 --> 01:04:36,247
I have

546
01:04:36,349 --> 01:04:38,247
to talk to you.

547
01:04:43,449 --> 01:04:46,846
Earlier, before the phone rang,

548
01:04:48,449 --> 01:04:51,381
I said I didn't want to take this job

549
01:04:52,015 --> 01:04:54,277
if I couldn't be sure of your love.

550
01:04:56,149 --> 01:04:59,774
You said you loved me

551
01:05:00,748 --> 01:05:03,010
and that I should take it.

552
01:05:08,216 --> 01:05:10,205
I'm sure you lied.

553
01:05:12,449 --> 01:05:14,347
Why? I don't know.

554
01:05:15,382 --> 01:05:18,576
Out of pity, self-interest...

555
01:05:18,816 --> 01:05:20,872
What self-interest?

556
01:05:22,482 --> 01:05:24,970
To hold on to this flat.

557
01:05:25,982 --> 01:05:28,608
How can you know what I think?

558
01:05:29,349 --> 01:05:31,837
In fact, I couldn't care less.

559
01:05:32,082 --> 01:05:34,776
Sell the flat, see if I care.

560
01:05:36,316 --> 01:05:39,305
Earlier you said it was better than a hotel.

561
01:05:39,616 --> 01:05:41,411
Not at all.

562
01:05:41,982 --> 01:05:44,175
I said that to make you happy.

563
01:05:45,716 --> 01:05:47,977
That's beside the point.

564
01:05:49,683 --> 01:05:51,910
I want to know why you lied.

565
01:05:52,349 --> 01:05:54,542
Who said I lied? Stop it!

566
01:05:54,649 --> 01:05:56,205
You did.

567
01:05:56,316 --> 01:05:58,441
I can tell you've stopped loving me.

568
01:05:58,915 --> 01:06:01,972
What's the use of knowing the truth?

569
01:06:02,282 --> 01:06:04,407
See? You admit I'm right.

570
01:06:05,015 --> 01:06:08,038
I don't admit a thing. Leave me alone.

571
01:06:11,716 --> 01:06:14,682
It's true. I don't love you anymore.

572
01:06:19,049 --> 01:06:21,742
There's nothing to explain. I don't love you.

573
01:06:22,349 --> 01:06:23,814
Why?

574
01:06:23,915 --> 01:06:26,006
Yesterday you still loved me.

575
01:06:27,049 --> 01:06:29,572
Yes, very much.

576
01:06:31,349 --> 01:06:33,508
Now it's over.

577
01:06:35,182 --> 01:06:37,011
There must be a reason.

578
01:06:38,049 --> 01:06:40,379
There must be.

579
01:06:42,049 --> 01:06:43,810
What is it?

580
01:06:44,216 --> 01:06:45,977
I don't know.

581
01:06:46,549 --> 01:06:49,071
All I know is I don't love you anymore.

582
01:06:50,583 --> 01:06:52,946
Since we were at Prokosch's?

583
01:06:53,648 --> 01:06:56,978
When you saw me pat Francesca Vanini's behind?

584
01:07:01,049 --> 01:07:03,379
Let's say it was that.

585
01:07:04,482 --> 01:07:07,004
Now it's over. Let's not talk about it.

586
01:07:09,782 --> 01:07:12,214
Something happened today.

587
01:07:13,449 --> 01:07:15,812
It changed your mind about me,

588
01:07:16,616 --> 01:07:18,740
hence, your love for me.

589
01:07:22,216 --> 01:07:24,478
You're crazy, but you're smart.

590
01:07:25,049 --> 01:07:26,708
Then it's true.

591
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:34,640
I didn't say that.

592
01:07:36,915 --> 01:07:39,313
I said you're bright.

593
01:07:40,382 --> 01:07:44,746
Was it something I said or did today that you took the wrong way?

594
01:07:44,848 --> 01:07:46,576
Maybe.

595
01:07:46,949 --> 01:07:49,744
Don't talk to me that way! I forbid you!

596
01:08:09,249 --> 01:08:10,976
I despise you!

597
01:08:11,082 --> 01:08:13,139
That's really what I feel for you.

598
01:08:13,249 --> 01:08:16,147
That's why the love's gone. I despise you.

599
01:08:16,782 --> 01:08:19,112
And you disgust me when you touch me.

600
01:08:32,616 --> 01:08:34,548
You're going too far.

601
01:08:39,815 --> 01:08:44,214
Forget what I said, Paul. Act as though nothing happened.

602
01:10:25,416 --> 01:10:26,779
You okay?

603
01:12:06,748 --> 01:12:09,680
They say Ulysses came home to Penelope,

604
01:12:10,216 --> 01:12:14,012
but maybe Ulysses had been fed up with Penelope.

605
01:12:14,382 --> 01:12:16,506
So he went off to the Trojan war,

606
01:12:17,182 --> 01:12:19,704
and since he didn't feel like going home,

607
01:12:19,815 --> 01:12:22,508
he kept traveling as long as he could.

608
01:12:22,615 --> 01:12:25,241
Do you think it was an idea of his or...?

609
01:12:36,115 --> 01:12:38,342
- Why do you despise me? - Leave me alone!

610
01:12:55,216 --> 01:12:57,738
Coming to Capri with us, Mr. Lang?

611
01:12:59,782 --> 01:13:02,214
"Each morning, to earn my bread

612
01:13:02,316 --> 01:13:05,543
I go to the market where lies are sold

613
01:13:06,582 --> 01:13:10,981
and, hopeful, I get in line with the other sellers."

614
01:13:11,115 --> 01:13:14,081
- What's that? - Hollywood.

615
01:13:15,015 --> 01:13:17,480
From a ballad by poor B.B.

616
01:13:19,381 --> 01:13:20,972
Bertolt Brecht?

617
01:13:31,848 --> 01:13:34,939
Homer's world is a real world.

618
01:13:35,448 --> 01:13:38,244
And the poet belonged to a civilization

619
01:13:39,015 --> 01:13:43,970
that grew in harmony, not in opposition,

620
01:13:44,082 --> 01:13:45,638
with nature.

621
01:13:46,049 --> 01:13:48,038
And the beauty of The Odyssey

622
01:13:48,715 --> 01:13:51,875
lies precisely in this belief

623
01:13:52,415 --> 01:13:55,177
in reality as it is.

624
01:13:55,615 --> 01:13:58,638
Thus in reality as it appears objectively.

625
01:13:58,949 --> 01:14:00,574
Exactly,

626
01:14:00,682 --> 01:14:04,910
and in a form that cannot be broken down,

627
01:14:05,915 --> 01:14:07,608
and is what it is.

628
01:14:07,715 --> 01:14:10,272
Take it or leave it.

629
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:15,943
Because I have nothing to say.

630
01:14:30,615 --> 01:14:34,139
I don't know if I'll go to Capri. Where would we stay?

631
01:14:53,149 --> 01:14:54,876
Wherever he likes.

632
01:14:55,149 --> 01:14:59,410
Producers are something I can easily do without.

633
01:15:29,515 --> 01:15:32,640
Don't come if you don't want to. I'm not forcing you.

634
01:15:34,348 --> 01:15:36,610
It's not you that's forcing me.

635
01:15:37,882 --> 01:15:39,677
It's life.

636
01:16:08,481 --> 01:16:10,140
What are you doing?

637
01:16:14,015 --> 01:16:15,571
What are you doing?

638
01:16:16,848 --> 01:16:18,370
Looking.

639
01:16:18,481 --> 01:16:20,674
Don't stay by yourself. Join us.

640
01:16:22,281 --> 01:16:24,304
What were you talking about?

641
01:16:24,415 --> 01:16:26,278
The Odyssey.

642
01:16:27,248 --> 01:16:29,476
I agree with Prokosch's theory.

643
01:16:30,782 --> 01:16:32,475
What theory's that?

644
01:16:32,915 --> 01:16:36,506
That Ulysses loves his wife, but she doesn't love him.

645
01:16:39,148 --> 01:16:41,114
You really think that?

646
01:16:43,215 --> 01:16:44,704
I'm sure you don't.

647
01:16:51,082 --> 01:16:53,172
Please, you're in frame.

648
01:16:53,281 --> 01:16:55,372
Places, everyone!

649
01:17:35,148 --> 01:17:37,137
Will they undress?

650
01:17:37,248 --> 01:17:38,646
Of course.

651
01:17:38,748 --> 01:17:40,737
Aren't movies great!

652
01:17:41,248 --> 01:17:43,214
You see women in dresses,

653
01:17:43,648 --> 01:17:45,944
in movies, you see their ass!

654
01:18:23,281 --> 01:18:25,406
Not at all. Go on, Camille.

655
01:18:26,782 --> 01:18:28,338
Go on.

656
01:18:30,982 --> 01:18:33,004
I don't mind, go on.

657
01:18:36,481 --> 01:18:39,572
I'll walk back with Mr. Lang to discuss The Odyssey.

658
01:19:15,615 --> 01:19:17,843
The girls are in the water.

659
01:19:18,682 --> 01:19:22,808
It won't take long. First a scene in which we see

660
01:19:23,181 --> 01:19:27,977
the Council of the Gods discussing man's fate.

661
01:20:07,648 --> 01:20:11,671
Aproducer can be a friend to a director.

662
01:20:12,215 --> 01:20:16,648
But Prokosch isn't a real producer. He's a dictator.

663
01:20:18,081 --> 01:20:22,776
I think it's stupid to change the character of Ulysses.

664
01:20:23,515 --> 01:20:27,311
He's not a modern-day neurotic,

665
01:20:27,415 --> 01:20:32,313
but a simple, clever and robust man.

666
01:20:33,248 --> 01:20:35,407
I find the idea interesting.

667
01:20:36,381 --> 01:20:38,972
It takes Ulysses 1 0 years to return home

668
01:20:39,315 --> 01:20:42,281
because he doesn't want to. It's logical.

669
01:20:43,481 --> 01:20:45,276
It's logical,

670
01:20:45,381 --> 01:20:48,904
and the illogical borrows from the logical.

671
01:20:49,782 --> 01:20:53,646
Your Corneille said it in his preface to Surena.

672
01:20:54,715 --> 01:20:58,670
Ulysses doesn't rush home to Ithaca

673
01:20:58,782 --> 01:21:01,838
because he was unhappy with Penelope,

674
01:21:03,582 --> 01:21:07,514
even before he went off.

675
01:21:14,215 --> 01:21:16,704
Had he been happy, he'd have stayed home.

676
01:21:17,914 --> 01:21:20,971
He used the Trojan war to get away from his wife.

677
01:21:21,615 --> 01:21:24,978
He killed her suitors, didn't he?

678
01:21:25,682 --> 01:21:27,671
That can be justified...

679
01:21:27,782 --> 01:21:30,941
by the fact that Ulysses had told Penelope

680
01:21:31,048 --> 01:21:33,537
to give in and accept the gifts.

681
01:21:34,748 --> 01:21:37,804
He didn't see the suitors as serious threats.

682
01:21:38,615 --> 01:21:41,479
He didn't throw them out, to avoid a scandal.

683
01:21:42,782 --> 01:21:45,077
Knowing Penelope to be faithful,

684
01:21:45,847 --> 01:21:48,870
he told her to be nice to the suitors.

685
01:21:55,648 --> 01:21:57,909
I think that's when Penelope,

686
01:21:58,014 --> 01:22:02,379
who at heart is a simple woman,

687
01:22:03,515 --> 01:22:05,980
began to despise him.

688
01:22:06,881 --> 01:22:10,814
She stopped loving Ulysses because of his conduct

689
01:22:11,881 --> 01:22:14,109
and she told him so.

690
01:22:14,948 --> 01:22:18,971
Ulysses then realized too late he'd lost Penelope's love

691
01:22:19,648 --> 01:22:22,943
because he'd been overly cautious.

692
01:22:24,315 --> 01:22:26,543
The only way to win her back

693
01:22:27,215 --> 01:22:29,681
was to murder the suitors.

694
01:22:29,782 --> 01:22:32,407
Death is no resolution.

695
01:25:23,582 --> 01:25:25,740
I found this on the boat.

696
01:25:26,714 --> 01:25:29,976
Children mustn't play with firearms.

697
01:26:20,315 --> 01:26:22,644
I was there, outside.

698
01:26:23,381 --> 01:26:25,176
Nothing.

699
01:27:21,248 --> 01:27:23,476
I'm a playwright.

700
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:26,770
I'm not a screenwriter.

701
01:27:32,081 --> 01:27:35,047
Even if it's a fine script... I'm being frank,

702
01:27:35,148 --> 01:27:37,376
I'd do it only for the money!

703
01:27:44,048 --> 01:27:46,139
That's why I'm in a bad mood.

704
01:27:50,581 --> 01:27:54,344
We all have an ideal. Mine's writing plays. I can't. Why?

705
01:27:57,581 --> 01:28:01,741
In today's world, we have to accept what others want.

706
01:28:05,114 --> 01:28:07,909
Why does money matter so much in what we do,

707
01:28:08,181 --> 01:28:10,612
in what we are, in what we become?

708
01:28:12,847 --> 01:28:15,642
Even in our relationships with those we love.

709
01:28:39,881 --> 01:28:43,643
Mr. Prokosch already said it: You're wrong.

710
01:28:43,747 --> 01:28:46,975
You aspire to a world like Homer's.

711
01:28:47,281 --> 01:28:50,713
You want it to exist, but unfortunately it doesn't.

712
01:28:50,847 --> 01:28:52,506
Why not? It does!

713
01:29:01,181 --> 01:29:03,147
You may be right,

714
01:29:03,248 --> 01:29:07,703
but when it comes to making movies, dreams aren't enough.

715
01:29:16,747 --> 01:29:19,043
When do we eat?

716
01:29:22,747 --> 01:29:24,406
In an hour.

717
01:29:25,781 --> 01:29:27,713
I'm going for a walk.

718
01:29:36,414 --> 01:29:38,505
Mr. Prokosch wants to speak with you.

719
01:29:44,881 --> 01:29:47,779
Is that an order or a request?

720
01:29:47,881 --> 01:29:49,574
A request.

721
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,174
One must suffer.

722
01:30:01,314 --> 01:30:03,008
That's for sure.

723
01:31:04,181 --> 01:31:05,737
It's me, Paul.

724
01:31:12,981 --> 01:31:16,606
I've been watching you as if I were seeing you for the first time.

725
01:31:30,014 --> 01:31:31,980
Mind if I stay?

726
01:31:33,114 --> 01:31:34,943
Stay if you like.

727
01:31:54,981 --> 01:31:57,174
Why didn't you speak up earlier?

728
01:31:58,214 --> 01:32:02,146
I don't get you! You always said you loved that script.

729
01:32:02,681 --> 01:32:05,909
Now you tell the producer it's for the money,

730
01:32:06,014 --> 01:32:08,241
that your ideal's the theater.

731
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:14,545
He's no fool. Next time, he'll think twice before asking you.

732
01:32:14,881 --> 01:32:17,642
How can you not understand something so simple?

733
01:32:21,647 --> 01:32:23,840
I bet you'll do it anyway.

734
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:28,869
You'll see.

735
01:32:29,781 --> 01:32:31,610
I know you.

736
01:32:33,514 --> 01:32:35,446
I know you.

737
01:32:36,347 --> 01:32:39,939
If I do, it'll be for you. To pay for the flat.

738
01:32:40,914 --> 01:32:44,311
I'll let you decide whether I do the script or not.

739
01:32:44,914 --> 01:32:48,311
If you say no, we'll leave.

740
01:32:48,681 --> 01:32:50,442
Very clever!

741
01:32:50,547 --> 01:32:52,843
Not at all. Why?

742
01:32:53,148 --> 01:32:56,046
If you regret it later, you can blame it on me.

743
01:32:56,148 --> 01:32:58,909
Not at all! I'm asking you to decide.

744
01:32:59,014 --> 01:33:01,536
You really want me to tell you what to do?

745
01:33:01,647 --> 01:33:03,169
Yes.

746
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:05,303
Then do the script!

747
01:33:05,414 --> 01:33:07,539
You signed a contract and you bore me.

748
01:33:11,881 --> 01:33:14,346
I saw him kiss you earlier.

749
01:33:14,447 --> 01:33:15,936
I know you did.

750
01:33:19,948 --> 01:33:21,914
Why don't you love me anymore?

751
01:33:23,114 --> 01:33:24,511
That's life.

752
01:33:26,114 --> 01:33:27,943
Why do you despise me?

753
01:33:29,781 --> 01:33:33,009
I'll never tell you, even if I were dying.

754
01:33:38,814 --> 01:33:42,439
- Tell me or I'll hurt you. - Why hurt me on top of it?

755
01:33:46,981 --> 01:33:49,310
I have to know why you despise me.

756
01:33:50,214 --> 01:33:53,942
This is crazy! How can you expect me to accept it?

757
01:33:55,814 --> 01:33:58,336
We need the money to pay for the flat.

758
01:33:58,447 --> 01:34:00,208
I quit my typing job.

759
01:34:00,314 --> 01:34:02,371
I can't accept that after what happened.

760
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:05,369
So, of course, you despise me.

761
01:34:22,681 --> 01:34:26,977
You see us kiss but you're ready to change your mind anyway.

762
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:31,479
I turned the job down for you. So you'd change your mind about me.

763
01:34:33,214 --> 01:34:36,237
Don't touch me. I don't love you anymore.

764
01:34:38,048 --> 01:34:40,536
There's no way I'll ever love you again.

765
01:34:42,247 --> 01:34:44,907
Even if I turn it down, you'll despise me?

766
01:34:45,747 --> 01:34:48,212
- Yes, I will. - Why?

767
01:34:48,914 --> 01:34:51,311
Tell me why! There must be a reason.

768
01:34:51,614 --> 01:34:53,807
You're the reason.

769
01:34:53,914 --> 01:34:55,777
What do you mean, me?

770
01:34:57,514 --> 01:35:00,503
I don't know. You're not a man.

771
01:35:01,881 --> 01:35:04,006
Anyhow, it's too late.

772
01:35:04,881 --> 01:35:07,403
I've changed my mind about you.

773
01:35:08,781 --> 01:35:11,178
I know why you despise me.

774
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:14,303
When I took the taxi the other day,

775
01:35:14,414 --> 01:35:17,312
you thought I let you go with him on purpose.

776
01:35:20,914 --> 01:35:24,346
Same thing on the boat earlier. Don't be stupid!

777
01:35:24,581 --> 01:35:26,944
I have faults, but that's not one.

778
01:35:27,047 --> 01:35:29,036
I'll never forgive you.

779
01:35:30,881 --> 01:35:33,039
I loved you so much.

780
01:35:35,380 --> 01:35:37,209
Now it's impossible.

781
01:35:38,714 --> 01:35:41,874
I hate you because you're incapable of moving me.

782
01:35:42,414 --> 01:35:44,141
I can! You're on the verge of tears.

783
01:35:57,847 --> 01:36:00,642
We're leaving! We'll pack up and go.

784
01:36:01,547 --> 01:36:04,741
I'm staying. Go if you like.

785
01:36:06,180 --> 01:36:07,908
Come on, Camille!

786
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:14,041
Then I'm staying, too.

787
01:36:14,347 --> 01:36:16,904
But Prokosch will throw us out.

788
01:36:17,013 --> 01:36:19,241
- Don't start! - I will!

789
01:37:01,414 --> 01:37:02,902
Dear Paul,

790
01:37:03,013 --> 01:37:06,138
I found your revolver and took the bullets out.

791
01:37:06,347 --> 01:37:09,643
If you won't leave, I will.

792
01:37:10,047 --> 01:37:13,309
Since Prokosch has to return to Rome,

793
01:37:13,414 --> 01:37:15,346
I'm going with him.

794
01:37:15,647 --> 01:37:19,204
Then I'll probably move into a hotel alone.

795
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:22,176
Take care. Farewell.

796
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:24,605
Camille.

797
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:10,109
Typist.

798
01:38:16,180 --> 01:38:17,646
Me?

799
01:38:19,681 --> 01:38:21,510
Typist.

800
01:38:46,514 --> 01:38:49,503
What do you think...

801
01:38:50,414 --> 01:38:52,175
of me?

802
01:38:52,813 --> 01:38:57,143
Get into your Alfa, Romeo. We'll see about that later.

803
01:38:57,247 --> 01:38:59,736
TAKE CARE

804
01:39:08,780 --> 01:39:12,110
FAREWELL

805
01:40:15,047 --> 01:40:16,638
Good-bye, then.

806
01:40:59,380 --> 01:41:02,210
Mr. Lang, I've come to say good-bye.

807
01:41:03,947 --> 01:41:06,777
Good-bye. What will you do?

808
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:11,003
Go back to Rome, finish my play.

809
01:41:13,247 --> 01:41:14,543
And you?

810
01:41:14,646 --> 01:41:18,511
I'll finish the film. Always finish what you start.

811
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:22,669
What shot are you doing?

812
01:41:23,713 --> 01:41:27,202
Ulysses' gaze when he first sees his homeland again.

813
01:41:30,113 --> 01:41:31,806
Ithaca.

814
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:35,342
Good-bye, Mr. Lang.

815
01:41:35,746 --> 01:41:37,871
I hope we'll meet again.

816
01:41:41,880 --> 01:41:43,743
We're ready, Mr. Lang.

817
01:41:44,780 --> 01:41:46,542
Quiet on the set!
