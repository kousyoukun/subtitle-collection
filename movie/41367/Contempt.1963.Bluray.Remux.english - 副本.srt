16
00:-52:-48,-333 --> 00:-52:-42,-709
Andr?Bazin said: "Cinema shows us
a world that fits our desires."

17
00:-52:-39,-958 --> 00:-52:-36,-875
Contempt is the story of that world.

18
00:-52:-22,-416 --> 00:-52:-19,-625
I don't know.

19
00:-52:-19,-458 --> 00:-52:-14,-625
Maybe I'll go to Mum's.
I don't know what I'll do afterwards.

20
00:-52:-12,-583 --> 00:-52:-06,000
Come pick me up if you want.
At 4 o'clock. At Cinecitt?

21
00:-52:-02,-958 --> 00:-52:00,-084
I have to talk to that American.

22
00:-51:-57,-958 --> 00:-51:-55,-542
Maybe I will.

23
00:-51:-52,-208 --> 00:-51:-47,-375
- See my feet in the mirror?
- Yes.

24
00:-51:-45,-499 --> 00:-51:-41,-500
- Think they're pretty?
- Very.

25
00:-51:-39,-291 --> 00:-51:-33,-917
- You like my ankles?
- Yes.

26
00:-51:-31,-708 --> 00:-51:-28,-250
And my knees, too?

27
00:-51:-27,-208 --> 00:-51:-23,-750
Yes. I really like your knees.

28
00:-51:-20,-708 --> 00:-51:-18,000
And my thighs?

29
00:-51:-16,-499 --> 00:-51:-14,-084
And your thighs.

30
00:-51:-09,-499 --> 00:-51:-05,-875
Do you see my bottom in the mirror?

31
00:-51:-04,-208 --> 00:-51:-01,-917
Yes.

32
00:-50:-59,-583 --> 00:-50:-56,-250
Do you think I have nice buttocks?

33
00:-50:-54,-791 --> 00:-50:-52,-417
Yes. Very.

34
00:-50:-49,-583 --> 00:-50:-45,-625
- Shall I get on my knees?
- No.

35
00:-50:-43,-749 --> 00:-50:-37,-875
- No need to.
- And my breasts. You like them?

36
00:-50:-37,-708 --> 00:-50:-30,-584
- Yes, tremendously.
- Gently, Paul. Not so hard.

37
00:-50:-28,-124 --> 00:-50:-26,-042
Sorry.

38
00:-50:-24,-916 --> 00:-50:-18,-584
Which do you like better,
my breasts or my nipples?

39
00:-50:-15,-041 --> 00:-50:-11,-375
I don't know. Both equally.

40
00:-50:-08,-749 --> 00:-50:-03,-334
- And do you like my shoulders?
- Yes.

41
00:-50:-02,-499 --> 00:-49:-56,-875
- I don't think they're round enough.
- I do.

42
00:-49:-54,-333 --> 00:-49:-51,-625
And my arms?

43
00:-49:-43,-749 --> 00:-49:-41,-167
And my face?

44
00:-49:-38,-791 --> 00:-49:-35,-417
- And your face.
- All of it?

45
00:-49:-35,-249 --> 00:-49:-30,-750
My mouth, my eyes,
my nose, my ears?

46
00:-49:-30,-583 --> 00:-49:-24,-125
- Yes, everything.
- Then you love me totally.

47
00:-49:-23,-083 --> 00:-49:-17,-042
I love you totally,
tenderly, tragically.

48
00:-49:-15,-041 --> 00:-49:-12,-542
So do I, Paul.

49
00:-49:-09,-124 --> 00:-49:-03,-667
Hi. How are you?
What's going on? The place is empty!

50
00:-49:-03,-499 --> 00:-48:-58,-959
Jerry fired nearly everybody.
Italian cinema is in trouble.

51
00:-48:-58,-791 --> 00:-48:-54,-042
- Where is he?
- Over there.

52
00:-48:-14,-166 --> 00:-48:-11,-375
Only yesterday
there were kings here.

53
00:-48:-05,-374 --> 00:-48:-02,-959
Princesses, lovers...

54
00:-47:-59,-458 --> 00:-47:-56,-542
All human emotions.

55
00:-47:-50,-208 --> 00:-47:-47,-375
Yesterday he sold everything.

56
00:-47:-43,-874 --> 00:-47:-40,-542
They're going to build
a supermarket.

57
00:-47:-38,-416 --> 00:-47:-33,000
- It's the end of cinema.
- I don't think cinema will ever die.

58
00:-47:-26,-999 --> 00:-47:-21,-959
He says you wrote Toto against
Hercules. It's doing well in New York.

59
00:-47:-21,-791 --> 00:-47:-19,-084
Not bad.

60
00:-47:-14,-041 --> 00:-47:-08,-792
Don't be modest,
You need pride to make good films.

61
00:-47:-08,-624 --> 00:-47:-03,-959
- Do you know The Odyssey?
- Your film with Fritz Lang?

62
00:-46:-59,-916 --> 00:-46:-55,-334
- It's not working out.
- Why did you hire Lang?

63
00:-46:-49,-749 --> 00:-46:-43,-417
The Odyssey needs a German director
because a German discovered Troy.

64
00:-46:-43,-249 --> 00:-46:-38,-917
What should I do?

65
00:-46:-26,-208 --> 00:-46:-19,-709
He needs new scenes for The Odyssey,
not only more sex, but more...

66
00:-46:-19,-541 --> 00:-46:-16,-084
Like all producers,
he doesn't know.

67
00:-46:-04,-458 --> 00:-45:-59,-834
To know that one doesn't know
is the gift of a superior spirit.

68
00:-45:-56,-958 --> 00:-45:-53,-084
Not to know and think that one knows
is a mistake.

69
00:-45:-48,-999 --> 00:-45:-45,000
To know it is a mistake
keeps one from making it.

70
00:-45:-42,-874 --> 00:-45:-40,-292
I don't think Lang will accept.

71
00:-45:-36,-708 --> 00:-45:-29,-834
In '33, Goebbels asked Lang to head the
German film industry. Lang left Germany.

72
00:-45:-17,-458 --> 00:-45:-12,-542
This is not '33 and Mr. Prokosch
knows you'll do the job.

73
00:-45:-12,-374 --> 00:-45:-09,-875
Why?

74
00:-45:-06,-624 --> 00:-45:00,-750
He'll tell you during the projection.
This way.

75
00:-44:-29,-374 --> 00:-44:-25,-292
So... Why?

76
00:-44:-21,-958 --> 00:-44:-16,-125
- Because you need money.
- How does he know?

77
00:-44:-08,-166 --> 00:-44:-03,-709
He was told you have
a very beautiful wife.

78
00:-43:-46,-541 --> 00:-43:-43,-084
Each film should have
a definite point of view.

79
00:-43:-35,-083 --> 00:-43:-31,-959
It's the eternal problem
of the ancient Greeks.

80
00:-43:-21,-458 --> 00:-43:-17,-250
It's a fight against the gods.
The fight of Ulysses.

81
00:-42:-21,-583 --> 00:-42:-19,-167
This is Minerva, isn't it?

82
00:-42:-17,-458 --> 00:-42:-14,-917
She's Ulysses' protector.

83
00:-42:-12,-083 --> 00:-42:-07,-917
And that's Neptune,
his mortal enemy.

84
00:-41:-24,-874 --> 00:-41:-21,-667
Mr. Prokosch likes gods.

85
00:-41:-18,-833 --> 00:-41:-16,-084
He knows how they feel.

86
00:-41:-02,-083 --> 00:-40:-58,-667
Look, that's Homer.

87
00:-40:-58,-499 --> 00:-40:-52,-959
The gods did not create man,
man created gods.

88
00:-40:-42,-291 --> 00:-40:-39,-500
It's a mermaid.

89
00:-40:-29,-166 --> 00:-40:-25,-167
That's art,
but will the public understand?

90
00:-40:-14,-708 --> 00:-40:-11,-417
- Who's that?
- Penelope.

91
00:-40:-03,-916 --> 00:-40:00,-709
Mr. Prokosch has a theory
about The Odyssey.

92
00:-40:00,-541 --> 00:-39:-56,-500
He thinks Ulysses' wife
was unfaithful.

93
00:-39:-39,-124 --> 00:-39:-33,-542
O my brothers, who braved
100,000 perils to reach the West,

94
00:-39:-33,-374 --> 00:-39:-27,-500
don't refuse to know, by following
the sun, the uninhabited world.

95
00:-39:-26,-083 --> 00:-39:-20,-959
"Consider your origin.
You were not born to live as brutes,

96
00:-39:-20,-791 --> 00:-39:-17,-334
but to pursue virtue and knowledge."

97
00:-39:-15,-583 --> 00:-39:-10,-625
- Have you heard that before?
- Yes, it's very famous. Dante.

98
00:-39:-08,-499 --> 00:-39:-05,-125
"Night then looked all the stars.

99
00:-38:-55,-708 --> 00:-38:-51,-334
Our joy soon turned to tears

100
00:-38:-48,-541 --> 00:-38:-45,-250
until the sea closed in on us."

101
00:-37:-42,-291 --> 00:-37:-36,-667
- I'm Paul Javal. Mr. Prokosch...
- I know.

102
00:-37:-36,-499 --> 00:-37:-33,-375
It looks swell.
I really like Cinemascope.

103
00:-37:-33,-208 --> 00:-37:-27,-750
It wasn't made for people
but for snakes and funerals.

104
00:-37:-04,-041 --> 00:-36:-59,-709
What's the matter, Miss Vanini?
ls it about the script?

105
00:-36:-29,-541 --> 00:-36:-25,-209
He says it's not the same
on screen as on paper.

106
00:-36:-10,-999 --> 00:-36:-08,-584
I'll just see if my wife's arrived.

107
00:-35:-53,-541 --> 00:-35:-47,-292
...The Nazis used to say "revolver"
instead of "cheque book".

108
00:-35:-30,-083 --> 00:-35:-26,-459
Are you going to accept the job?
Yes or no?

109
00:-34:-50,-874 --> 00:-34:-45,-125
"But Man, when he must, can stand
fearless and alone before God.

110
00:-34:-44,-958 --> 00:-34:-39,-625
His candour is his shield.
He needs neither arms nor wiles

111
00:-34:-39,-458 --> 00:-34:-35,-375
until such time
as God's absence helps him."

112
00:-34:-35,-208 --> 00:-34:-30,-292
- That's Hölderlin, isn't it?
- Yes. The Poet's Vocation.

113
00:-34:-28,-916 --> 00:-34:-24,-667
The final line is obscure.
Hölderlin originally wrote...

114
00:-34:-20,-958 --> 00:-34:-15,-500
- "So long as God is not present."
- And then...

115
00:-34:-12,-416 --> 00:-34:-09,-375
"So long as God is close to us."

116
00:-34:-09,-208 --> 00:-34:-02,-500
The way the last lines are written,
when you've read the other two,

117
00:-34:-01,-541 --> 00:-33:-58,-209
is no longer about God's presence.

118
00:-33:-58,-041 --> 00:-33:-54,-750
It's God's absence
that reassures Man.

119
00:-33:-54,-583 --> 00:-33:-51,000
Strange, but true.

120
00:-33:-49,-333 --> 00:-33:-44,-500
How do you say "strange" in Italian?

121
00:-33:-30,-208 --> 00:-33:-27,-584
I'll be back in five minutes.

122
00:-32:-52,-374 --> 00:-32:-48,-542
Meet Mr. Prokosch.
Camille, my wife.

123
00:-32:-39,-999 --> 00:-32:-37,-292
- My wife, Camille.
- How do you do?

124
00:-32:-37,-124 --> 00:-32:-34,-334
- Fritz Lang.
- Hello.

125
00:-32:-34,-166 --> 00:-32:-31,-042
He's the one who did
that western with Dietrich.

126
00:-32:-30,-874 --> 00:-32:-26,-667
- It was terrific!
- I prefer M.

127
00:-32:-26,-499 --> 00:-32:-23,-209
We just saw it on TV.
I really liked it.

128
00:-32:-23,-041 --> 00:-32:-20,-209
Thank you. That's kind of you.

129
00:-32:-20,-041 --> 00:-32:-14,-875
I love the scene
when Ferrer leans on the scales.

130
00:-32:-14,-708 --> 00:-32:-11,-125
Thank you.
When I finish The Odyssey...

131
00:-32:-07,-416 --> 00:-32:-03,-084
Mr. Prokosch is inviting you
for a drink.

132
00:-32:-02,-916 --> 00:-32:-01,-084
I don't know.

133
00:-31:-57,-208 --> 00:-31:-52,-792
- He says you know perfectly.
- Me?

134
00:-31:-48,-791 --> 00:-31:-46,-500
Yes, I could have a drink.

135
00:-31:-40,-416 --> 00:-31:-37,-542
Goodbye, I'll phone you.
Madam.

136
00:-31:-30,-499 --> 00:-31:-28,-084
We'll go if you want.

137
00:-31:-24,-916 --> 00:-31:-21,-667
Sit down, madam.

138
00:-31:-20,-166 --> 00:-31:-16,000
- You won't be comfortable...
- I'll meet you there.

139
00:-31:-15,-833 --> 00:-31:-12,000
- Mr. Prokosch will come back for you.
- No, I'll grab a taxi.

140
00:-31:-11,-833 --> 00:-31:-08,-667
Let him go on ahead.
We can both take a cab.

141
00:-31:-08,-499 --> 00:-31:-06,-417
Make up your mind.

142
00:-31:-06,-249 --> 00:-31:-02,-375
Come on, you go.

143
00:-30:-20,-708 --> 00:-30:-18,-500
What's the address?

144
00:-29:-08,-416 --> 00:-29:-03,-459
- What did he say?
- My English is as bad as yours.

145
00:-28:-58,-999 --> 00:-28:-54,-250
We've been waiting half an hour.
What kept you?

146
00:-28:-43,-333 --> 00:-28:-40,-584
Nothing. I had an accident...

147
00:-28:-40,-416 --> 00:-28:-34,-875
I was in the cab,
and at the corner of the street...

148
00:-28:-34,-708 --> 00:-28:-28,-709
Two cars, you know...
The whole bumper was hanging off.

149
00:-28:-28,-541 --> 00:-28:-24,-167
Then the two drivers
started shouting at each other.

150
00:-28:-21,-749 --> 00:-28:-16,-750
- I needed another cab. That's why...
- That's why, what?

151
00:-28:-14,-374 --> 00:-28:-08,-667
What? Why I'm late.
I had to walk God knows how long...

152
00:-28:-08,-499 --> 00:-28:-04,-167
From Saint-Ange to Piazza Venezia
to find a cab.

153
00:-27:-59,-916 --> 00:-27:-57,-042
Yeah, it took ages.

154
00:-27:-50,-208 --> 00:-27:-45,-375
Anyway, I don't give a damn.
I'm not interested in your story.

155
00:-27:-41,-124 --> 00:-27:-38,-334
It took me 20 minutes.

156
00:-27:-34,-916 --> 00:-27:-31,-625
- You don't believe me.
- We'll discuss it later.

157
00:-27:-29,-624 --> 00:-27:-27,-125
I'm going for a walk.

158
00:-26:-47,-874 --> 00:-26:-43,-334
- Come tomorrow to sign the contract.
- All right.

159
00:-26:-40,-833 --> 00:-26:-37,-667
Camille, why are you so quiet?

160
00:-25:-52,-333 --> 00:-25:-47,-584
Friday we shoot in Capri.
Come with us.

161
00:-25:-47,-416 --> 00:-25:-42,-625
Answer her.
Why don't you speak?

162
00:-25:-40,-249 --> 00:-25:-35,-667
- What were you doing before I arrived?
- Nothing special.

163
00:-25:-35,-499 --> 00:-25:-32,-375
Why? Did he come on to you?

164
00:-25:-30,-874 --> 00:-25:-27,-042
- Why ask me that?
- Just because.

165
00:-25:-20,-416 --> 00:-25:-17,-792
I should wash my hands.

166
00:-25:-10,-416 --> 00:-25:-06,-459
- Where can I wash?
- Upstairs, on the right.

167
00:-24:-59,-458 --> 00:-24:-55,-042
- What's the matter? You look down.
- Nothing.

168
00:-24:-52,-624 --> 00:-24:-48,-834
Have you been crying?

169
00:-24:-47,-624 --> 00:-24:-43,000
- Your boss is a hard man.
- He is.

170
00:-24:-40,-166 --> 00:-24:-37,-042
Known him long?

171
00:-24:-33,-749 --> 00:-24:-27,-167
- What did he do before movies?
- I don't want to talk about it.

172
00:-24:-26,-999 --> 00:-24:-23,-042
I was just asking.

173
00:-24:-22,-874 --> 00:-24:-19,-250
It's stupid to be so sweet
and so sad.

174
00:-24:-19,-083 --> 00:-24:-15,-125
Haven't you anything
more amusing to say?

175
00:-24:-14,-958 --> 00:-24:-12,-042
More amusing?

176
00:-24:-10,-458 --> 00:-24:-07,-959
A funny story.

177
00:-24:-06,-666 --> 00:-24:-03,-542
Which one shall I tell?

178
00:-24:-01,-833 --> 00:-23:-57,-042
I know, the one about
Sri Ramakrishna and his disciple.

179
00:-23:-51,-749 --> 00:-23:-47,-167
Ramakrishna was a Hindu sage.

180
00:-23:-46,-999 --> 00:-23:-41,-084
He had this disciple who didn't believe
in his master's teachings anymore.

181
00:-23:-39,-874 --> 00:-23:-34,-834
He decided to study on his own.
So he went away.

182
00:-23:-34,-666 --> 00:-23:-30,-292
After 15 years, he came back
and said: "I've found it!"

183
00:-23:-30,-124 --> 00:-23:-27,-667
Found what?

184
00:-23:-27,-499 --> 00:-23:-22,000
He tells the sage: "I'll show you"
and takes him to the riverbank.

185
00:-23:-21,-833 --> 00:-23:-17,-042
The disciple crosses back and forth
walking on the water.

186
00:-23:-16,-874 --> 00:-23:-11,-250
And he says: "You see? I can cross
without getting wet, now I know."

187
00:-23:-09,-166 --> 00:-23:-06,-459
So Ramakrishna replies:

188
00:-23:-06,-291 --> 00:-23:-01,-375
"You fool! I did that 10 years ago
with a rupee and a rowboat!"

189
00:-22:-56,-166 --> 00:-22:-52,-042
Feeling better now?
That's good.

190
00:-22:-50,-291 --> 00:-22:-47,-167
- Paul.
- What?

191
00:-22:-44,-999 --> 00:-22:-40,-500
- Call that washing your hands?
- As you can see.

192
00:-22:-40,-333 --> 00:-22:-35,-417
- I was just telling her the joke...
- I believe you already.

193
00:-22:-35,-249 --> 00:-22:-32,-417
You're being an idiot.

194
00:-22:-32,-249 --> 00:-22:-28,-292
- Where can I pee?
- Up there.

195
00:-22:-18,-583 --> 00:-22:-14,-209
It's a book about Roman paintings,
it will help you.

196
00:-22:-14,-041 --> 00:-22:-11,-542
The Odyssey is in Greek.

197
00:-22:-03,-166 --> 00:-22:00,-459
He knows.

198
00:-21:-41,-999 --> 00:-21:-38,-959
What? About what?

199
00:-21:-25,-624 --> 00:-21:-22,-500
About the money and your wife.

200
00:-21:-08,-749 --> 00:-21:-05,-625
Mr. Prokosch is inviting you
for dinner.

201
00:-21:-05,-458 --> 00:-21:-02,-625
I'm tired, I'd rather leave.

202
00:-20:-59,-999 --> 00:-20:-57,-334
Tell them we're leaving.

203
00:-20:-54,-458 --> 00:-20:-51,-375
We're leaving then.

204
00:-20:-46,-291 --> 00:-20:-43,-500
If you decide about Capri,
call tonight.

205
00:-20:-43,-333 --> 00:-20:-37,-917
- We must get the villa ready.
- Paul will call you.

206
00:-20:-35,-874 --> 00:-20:-32,-709
Why don't you come?

207
00:-20:-32,-541 --> 00:-20:-29,-750
It's my husband who decides.

208
00:-20:-21,-749 --> 00:-20:-18,-875
What interests you about The Odyssey?

209
00:-20:-18,-708 --> 00:-20:-14,-959
I don't know yet.

210
00:-20:-14,-791 --> 00:-20:-10,-625
Maybe because it's the opposite
of today's films which I hate.

211
00:-20:-08,-458 --> 00:-20:-04,-792
I'd like to return to Griffith
and Chaplin.

212
00:-20:-03,-083 --> 00:-20:00,-125
Like in the days of United Artists.

213
00:-19:-52,-833 --> 00:-19:-48,-792
The wise man does not oppress others
with his superiority.

214
00:-19:-45,-041 --> 00:-19:-40,-917
He doesn't humiliate them
for their impotence.

215
00:-19:-22,-624 --> 00:-19:-17,-042
He's crazy!
Did you see? He kicked me!

216
00:-19:-16,-874 --> 00:-19:-11,-209
You change your mind fast.
Monday you thought he was terrific.

217
00:-19:-03,-749 --> 00:-18:-58,-250
Now I think he's a jerk.
I have a right to change my mind.

218
00:-18:-51,-999 --> 00:-18:-49,-292
What happened in the past hour?

219
00:-18:-49,-124 --> 00:-18:-45,-584
Nothing. if you're happy, so am I.

220
00:-18:-19,-624 --> 00:-18:-16,-334
Rio Bravo is playing in town.

221
00:-18:-13,-749 --> 00:-18:-10,-709
So is Nicholas Ray's Bigger Than Life.

222
00:-18:-10,-541 --> 00:-18:-07,-125
I'm not interested.

223
00:-18:-06,-958 --> 00:-18:-03,-459
- I wrote it.
- I know.

224
00:-18:-01,-666 --> 00:-17:-58,-125
I phoned your mum's at lunchtime.
There was no answer.

225
00:-17:-57,-958 --> 00:-17:-53,-625
We ate here.
I didn't feel like going out.

226
00:-17:-48,-916 --> 00:-17:-44,-875
I like living here.
It's better than a hotel.

227
00:-17:-44,-708 --> 00:-17:-42,000
See? I was right.

228
00:-17:-40,-208 --> 00:-17:-37,-542
What are they paying
for the script?

229
00:-17:-37,-374 --> 00:-17:-33,-834
10,000 dollars. Six million lire.

230
00:-17:-33,-666 --> 00:-17:-29,-292
We can finish paying off the flat.
Isn't that great?

231
00:-17:-29,-124 --> 00:-17:-26,-459
Yes, it's great.

232
00:-17:-15,-916 --> 00:-17:-10,-792
When will you call your friend
about the curtains? It's annoying me.

233
00:-17:-10,-624 --> 00:-17:-08,-084
Once he's back from Spain.

234
00:-17:-07,-916 --> 00:-17:-05,-209
Roberto said he'd be back on Friday.

235
00:-16:-59,-958 --> 00:-16:-56,-292
Red velvet. It's that or nothing.

236
00:-16:-56,-124 --> 00:-16:-53,-709
Okay.

237
00:-16:-53,-541 --> 00:-16:-47,-375
- Set the table while I take a bath?
- I wanted to take a bath, too.

238
00:-16:-47,-208 --> 00:-16:-44,-167
You go first. I can do some work.

239
00:-16:-41,-208 --> 00:-16:-38,000
No, I'll go later, while it's cooking.

240
00:-16:-36,-874 --> 00:-16:-32,-625
You're cooking fagiolini again?

241
00:-16:-31,-333 --> 00:-16:-28,-875
Yes, whether you like it or not.

242
00:-16:-28,-708 --> 00:-16:-24,-375
- I can set the table.
- I was just doing it.

243
00:-15:-45,-208 --> 00:-15:-39,-417
I bought myself something today.
Tell me what you think.

244
00:-15:-39,-249 --> 00:-15:-36,-584
What did you buy?

245
00:-15:-30,-749 --> 00:-15:-29,-209
What?

246
00:-15:-29,-041 --> 00:-15:-24,-917
- Don't look yet.
- You want to go to Capri?

247
00:-15:-16,-749 --> 00:-15:-12,-084
- What?
- You want us to go to Capri?

248
00:-15:-08,-416 --> 00:-15:-05,-625
I won't say no,
but I won't say yes either.

249
00:-15:-05,-458 --> 00:-15:-03,-209
It would be like a holiday.

250
00:-15:00,-916 --> 00:-14:-56,-792
- Anyway, he didn't invite me.
- What?

251
00:-14:-54,-166 --> 00:-14:-50,-625
He invited you, not me.

252
00:-14:-42,-999 --> 00:-14:-39,-875
Where did we put the mirror?

253
00:-14:-21,-999 --> 00:-14:-18,-792
Not at all. We were both invited.

254
00:-14:-16,-999 --> 00:-14:-14,-417
Look.

255
00:-14:-11,-249 --> 00:-14:-07,-084
- Doesn't it suit me?
- No, I prefer you as a blonde.

256
00:-14:-06,-916 --> 00:-14:-02,-959
And I prefer you
without a hat and cigar.

257
00:-14:-02,-791 --> 00:-13:-58,-375
It's just to look like Dean Martin
in Some Came Running.

258
00:-13:-58,-208 --> 00:-13:-53,-084
- What a laugh!
- What is?

259
00:-13:-52,-916 --> 00:-13:-50,-250
You may want to look
like Dean Martin,

260
00:-13:-50,-083 --> 00:-13:-45,-625
but it's more like Martin's ass.
- Who's that?

261
00:-13:-45,-458 --> 00:-13:-40,-667
Never read the adventures
of Martin's ass?

262
00:-13:-40,-499 --> 00:-13:-35,-917
One day he goes to Baghdad
to buy a flying carpet.

263
00:-13:-35,-749 --> 00:-13:-32,-709
He finds this really nice one,

264
00:-13:-32,-541 --> 00:-13:-29,-375
so he sits on it,
but it doesn't take off.

265
00:-13:-29,-208 --> 00:-13:-26,-250
"Hardly surprising,"
says the carpet seller...

266
00:-13:-26,-083 --> 00:-13:-22,-875
- Are you listening?
- Yes.

267
00:-13:-22,-708 --> 00:-13:-17,-584
"The carpet won't take off
if you think about an ass."

268
00:-13:-17,-416 --> 00:-13:-13,-875
So Martin says:
"Okay, I won't think of an ass."

269
00:-13:-13,-708 --> 00:-13:-08,-917
But automatically he thinks of one,
so the carpet doesn't fly.

270
00:-13:-08,-749 --> 00:-13:-04,-917
What's that got to do with me?

271
00:-13:-04,-749 --> 00:-13:00,-667
- That's my point exactly.
- Well, I don't get it.

272
00:-12:-55,-624 --> 00:-12:-52,-125
Never mind.
Are you finished?

273
00:-12:-51,-958 --> 00:-12:-47,-209
No need to change the water.
I didn't use soap.

274
00:-12:-39,-916 --> 00:-12:-36,000
You've been acting weird.
What's wrong?

275
00:-12:-35,-833 --> 00:-12:-30,-709
Nothing. I knew you'd say that.

276
00:-12:-28,-583 --> 00:-12:-25,-959
Is it about that girl?

277
00:-12:-25,-791 --> 00:-12:-20,-500
It's nothing, I tell you.
I simply said you were an ass.

278
00:-12:-14,-624 --> 00:-12:-11,-792
Not the same sound all over.

279
00:-12:-09,-541 --> 00:-12:-05,-917
Why don't you want us
to go to Capri?

280
00:-12:-04,-333 --> 00:-12:-01,-417
Because you're an ass.

281
00:-11:-54,-041 --> 00:-11:-51,-542
You scare me, Paul.

282
00:-11:-50,-124 --> 00:-11:-47,-500
And it's not the first time.

283
00:-11:-47,-333 --> 00:-11:-44,000
So answer
instead of just standing there.

284
00:-11:-43,-833 --> 00:-11:-39,-209
Why did I marry a 28-year-old typist?

285
00:-11:-39,-041 --> 00:-11:-35,-625
It's true. I'm sorry.

286
00:-11:-31,-624 --> 00:-11:-28,-792
So am I.

287
00:-11:-17,-041 --> 00:-11:-11,-959
You go to Capri if you want.
I don't feel like it.

288
00:-11:-11,-791 --> 00:-11:-06,-375
Besides, I don't like
that Jeremy Prokosch. I told you.

289
00:-11:-06,-208 --> 00:-11:-03,-084
Why? Did he do something to you?

290
00:-11:-01,-541 --> 00:-10:-58,-542
Absolutely not.

291
00:-10:-45,-416 --> 00:-10:-42,-459
Why so thoughtful?

292
00:-10:-41,-416 --> 00:-10:-37,-334
Because I'm thinking,
believe it or not.

293
00:-10:-36,-124 --> 00:-10:-32,-375
- Surprised?
- No. Why?

294
00:-10:-30,-874 --> 00:-10:-26,-750
- An idea.
- Come with me. I won't go alone.

295
00:-10:-26,-583 --> 00:-10:-22,-417
You've been acting funny
since we met that guy.

296
00:-10:-19,-124 --> 00:-10:-16,-542
I'm not funny.

297
00:-10:-11,-541 --> 00:-10:-07,-167
- Why would you say that?
- Just because.

298
00:-10:-06,-999 --> 00:-10:-01,-084
We were fine this morning.
Now we're fighting over nothing.

299
00:-10:00,-916 --> 00:-09:-57,-042
- What's going on, baby?
- I want to have fun.

300
00:-09:-56,-874 --> 00:-09:-54,-042
Nothing's going on, Paul.

301
00:-09:-53,-874 --> 00:-09:-50,-167
I'm afraid I'll get bored there.

302
00:-09:-49,-999 --> 00:-09:-45,-709
I'm not going.

303
00:-09:-28,-083 --> 00:-09:-24,-042
Seen the house being built
across the way?

304
00:-09:-22,-541 --> 00:-09:-19,-625
It's awful.

305
00:-09:-19,-458 --> 00:-09:-16,000
If you love me, just be quiet.

306
00:-09:-07,-624 --> 00:-09:-03,-250
A husband has a right to know
why his wife's sulking.

307
00:-09:-01,-416 --> 00:-08:-56,-875
- I'm sure it's about that girl.
- Drop dead!

308
00:-08:-38,-749 --> 00:-08:-35,-584
Hello. Good afternoon.

309
00:-08:-34,-583 --> 00:-08:-31,-417
No, Camille isn't here.

310
00:-08:-30,-291 --> 00:-08:-26,-292
I thought you ate in town
and went shopping.

311
00:-08:-24,-416 --> 00:-08:-19,-459
She just walked in the door!
Your mother.

312
00:-07:-36,-624 --> 00:-07:-33,-042
I'll call you tomorrow. Ciao.

313
00:-07:-32,-874 --> 00:-07:-26,-500
You're out of your mind!
Why did you tell her I was out?

314
00:-07:-26,-333 --> 00:-07:-22,-542
- I don't know why.
- I know why.

315
00:-07:-22,-374 --> 00:-07:-15,-875
To find out if she had lunch with me
and if I wasn't lying.

316
00:-07:-15,-708 --> 00:-07:-10,-834
- That's it.
- Try that again and I'll divorce you.

317
00:-07:-09,-166 --> 00:-07:-03,-959
- Get up!
- What are you doing?

318
00:-07:-03,-791 --> 00:-07:-01,-042
I'm sleeping on the couch.

319
00:-07:00,-874 --> 00:-06:-54,-709
- When, tonight?
- Every night, starting tonight.

320
00:-06:-44,-749 --> 00:-06:-38,-584
Don't be angry. I just can't sleep
with the window open.

321
00:-06:-38,-416 --> 00:-06:-35,-625
We'll close the window.

322
00:-06:-35,-458 --> 00:-06:-31,-375
You always say you can't breathe.
No, we'll sleep apart.

323
00:-06:-31,-208 --> 00:-06:-26,-084
Thousands of couples do it.
They still get along fine.

324
00:-06:-25,-916 --> 00:-06:-22,-542
What did I do wrong? Tell me.

325
00:-06:-20,-541 --> 00:-06:-16,-584
I'm sorry I said you were out.
ls that it? Forgive me.

326
00:-06:-16,-416 --> 00:-06:-13,-042
Let me by.

327
00:-06:-12,-874 --> 00:-06:-08,-125
- Is that why you're in a bad mood?
- Yes, but not anymore.

328
00:-06:-05,-249 --> 00:-06:-01,-625
I'll be just fine here.

329
00:-06:-01,-458 --> 00:-05:-58,-292
I really wonder what I did.

330
00:-05:-52,-374 --> 00:-05:-49,-417
You're so mean all of a sudden.

331
00:-05:-49,-249 --> 00:-05:-45,-625
Me? I'm the same as always.

332
00:-05:-43,-541 --> 00:-05:-40,-417
You're the one who's changed.

333
00:-05:-35,-166 --> 00:-05:-30,-584
Ever since you've been
with movie people.

334
00:-05:-30,-416 --> 00:-05:-27,-375
You used to write crime novels.

335
00:-05:-27,-208 --> 00:-05:-21,-750
We didn't have much money,
but everything was fine.

336
00:-05:-14,-166 --> 00:-05:-08,000
What's this?
"Partito Comunista Italiano".

337
00:-05:-07,-833 --> 00:-05:-03,-417
- You never said you joined.
- That was two months ago in Paris.

338
00:-05:-03,-249 --> 00:-04:-57,-125
- Give me that.
- Let go! You'll bruise me.

339
00:-04:-56,-958 --> 00:-04:-53,-250
I'm working for you.
This place is not just for me!

340
00:-04:-53,-083 --> 00:-04:-48,-042
Please, Paul,
I don't want to argue.

341
00:-04:-39,-041 --> 00:-04:-35,-959
I don't want to go to Capri, either.

342
00:-04:-35,-791 --> 00:-04:-32,-542
Why not? Don't be stupid. Go.

343
00:-04:-26,-041 --> 00:-04:-22,-750
Paul, come here.

344
00:-04:-22,-583 --> 00:-04:-20,-042
What?

345
00:-04:-19,-874 --> 00:-04:-17,-292
No, I've lost interest.

346
00:-04:-17,-124 --> 00:-04:-13,-084
When Prokosch calls,
tell him I won't talk to him.

347
00:-04:-12,-083 --> 00:-04:-08,-917
Paul, come here.

348
00:-04:-05,-541 --> 00:-04:-02,-375
Why won't you do the script now?

349
00:-03:-59,-541 --> 00:-03:-56,-417
I'd have done it out of love for you.

350
00:-03:-54,-041 --> 00:-03:-50,-375
But you don't love me anymore.

351
00:-03:-50,-208 --> 00:-03:-47,-417
That's news!

352
00:-03:-42,-333 --> 00:-03:-38,000
"I had to judge a bottom contest
between three beautiful women.

353
00:-03:-37,-833 --> 00:-03:-35,-042
They chose me as a judge.

354
00:-03:-34,-874 --> 00:-03:-31,-584
They showed me
their dazzling nudity.

355
00:-03:-31,-416 --> 00:-03:-26,-584
The first had a white and gentle
curved back with round dimples.

356
00:-03:-26,-416 --> 00:-03:-21,-084
When the second parted her legs,
her snowy skin grew as red as a rose.

357
00:-03:-20,-916 --> 00:-03:-17,-625
The third was as still as a quiet sea.

358
00:-03:-17,-458 --> 00:-03:-11,-625
Her delicate skin rippled gently,
shivering involuntarily."

359
00:-03:-07,-541 --> 00:-03:-01,-917
We'll just mortgage the flat
when we run out of money.

360
00:-03:-01,-749 --> 00:-02:-57,-042
Something makes you think
I've stopped loving you?

361
00:-02:-56,-874 --> 00:-02:-53,-584
Yes.

362
00:-02:-53,-416 --> 00:-02:-49,-709
What?

363
00:-02:-47,-708 --> 00:-02:-45,-959
Everything.

364
00:-02:-45,-791 --> 00:-02:-42,-667
But what, for instance?

365
00:-02:-38,-374 --> 00:-02:-33,-125
- First tell me if it's true.
- No, you tell me first.

366
00:-02:-31,-791 --> 00:-02:-28,-459
What makes me think
you've stopped loving me?

367
00:-02:-28,-291 --> 00:-02:-25,-292
The way you've been talking to me.

368
00:-02:-24,-416 --> 00:-02:-20,-875
You weren't like that this morning.

369
00:-02:-15,-999 --> 00:-02:-13,-334
Nor yesterday.

370
00:-02:-10,-999 --> 00:-02:-07,-042
It's the way you look at me, too.

371
00:-02:00,-291 --> 00:-01:-53,-834
"The problem, in my opinion,
is in our conception of the world.

372
00:-01:-53,-666 --> 00:-01:-50,-500
A positive view or a negative one.

373
00:-01:-50,-333 --> 00:-01:-46,-292
Greek tragedy was negative
in that it made Man

374
00:-01:-46,-124 --> 00:-01:-42,-500
a victim of Fate,
as embodied by the Gods,

375
00:-01:-42,-333 --> 00:-01:-37,-750
and abandoned him
to a hopeless destiny."

376
00:-01:-36,-583 --> 00:-01:-31,-209
Why do you say it's the open window?
There's something else.

377
00:-01:-28,-541 --> 00:-01:-25,-667
I think so.

378
00:-01:-25,-499 --> 00:-01:-20,-709
"Man can rebel against things
that are bad, false.

379
00:-01:-20,-541 --> 00:-01:-14,-917
We must rebel when we're trapped
by circumstances, conventions.

380
00:-01:-14,-749 --> 00:-01:-10,-584
But I don't think
murder is a solution.

381
00:-01:-10,-416 --> 00:-01:-07,-500
Crimes of passion serve no purpose.

382
00:-01:-07,-333 --> 00:-01:-02,-125
I love a woman,
she cheats on me, I kill her.

383
00:-01:-01,-958 --> 00:00:-56,-917
What's left for me?
I lost her love since she's dead.

384
00:00:-56,-749 --> 00:00:-52,-209
If I kill her lover, she hates me,
and I still lose her love.

385
00:00:-52,-041 --> 00:00:-48,-375
Killing is never a solution."

386
00:00:-47,-333 --> 00:00:-45,-334
Look, Camille...

387
00:00:-45,-166 --> 00:00:-39,-250
I give you my word,
I can't sleep with the window open.

388
00:00:-39,-083 --> 00:00:-35,-584
I need silence and darkness.

389
00:00:-33,-458 --> 00:00:-30,-459
I swear it's true.

390
00:00:-26,-749 --> 00:00:-23,-167
And you move around too much.
You keep waking me.

391
00:00:-22,-999 --> 00:00:-19,-875
I want to sleep alone from now on.

392
00:00:-18,-458 --> 00:00:-15,-542
You don't want to make love?

393
00:00:-12,-374 --> 00:00:-09,000
Listen to this jerk.

394
00:00:-08,-833 --> 00:00:-05,-042
Is that a mocking smile
or a tender smile?

395
00:00:-03,-333 --> 00:00:00,-542
A tender smile.

396
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:05,958
- So, answer me!
- If it were true, I'd tell you.

397
00:00:06,126 --> 00:00:09,583
A woman can always find
an excuse not to make love.

398
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:15,250
- But you're really a jerk.
- Vulgar language doesn't suit you.

399
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:18,958
It doesn't suit me?

400
00:00:20,751 --> 00:00:23,833
Listen to this...

401
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:28,125
Asshole. Cunt.

402
00:00:28,292 --> 00:00:30,666
Shit.

403
00:00:31,417 --> 00:00:33,750
Christ almighty.

404
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:36,916
Craphole.

405
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:41,000
Son of a bitch.

406
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:43,833
Goddamn.

407
00:00:48,042 --> 00:00:52,583
So, still think
it doesn't suit me?

408
00:01:16,584 --> 00:01:20,375
Why don't you want
to make love anymore?

409
00:01:28,542 --> 00:01:33,625
All right. Let's do it, but fast.

410
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:40,041
I'd been thinking
Camille could leave me.

411
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:45,916
It was a possible disaster.
Now the disaster had happened.

412
00:01:46,084 --> 00:01:49,958
We used to live
in a cloud of unawareness,

413
00:01:50,126 --> 00:01:52,833
in delighted complicity.

414
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:58,000
Things happened with sudden,
wild, enchanted recklessness.

415
00:01:58,167 --> 00:02:04,458
I'd end up in Paul's arms,
hardly aware of what had happened.

416
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:09,791
This recklessness was now absent
in Camille, and thus in me.

417
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,125
Could I now watch her coldly,
prey to my excited senses,

418
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:17,375
as she could undoubtedly observe me?

419
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:23,500
I deliberately made that remark
with a secret feeling of revenge.

420
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:26,791
She seemed aware
that a lie could settle everything.

421
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,666
For a while, on the surface at least.
She was clearly tempted to lie.

422
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:35,958
But she thought better of it.

423
00:02:36,126 --> 00:02:38,208
Paul hurt me so much.

424
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:41,708
It was my turn now,
alluding to what I'd seen,

425
00:02:41,876 --> 00:02:44,875
without really being specific.

426
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:51,250
But I was wrong. She wasn't unfaithful,
or at least not obviously so.

427
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:56,000
The truth remained concealed.
We needed to dig deeper.

428
00:02:57,626 --> 00:03:03,500
I've noticed that the more we doubt,
the more we cling to a false lucidity,

429
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:10,291
in the hope of rationalizing
what feelings made murky and obscure.

430
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:13,041
I thought Camille might leave me.

431
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:17,750
It was a possible disaster.
Now the disaster had happened.

432
00:03:17,917 --> 00:03:23,958
We used to live in a cloud of
unawareness, in delicious complicity.

433
00:03:26,251 --> 00:03:29,708
Don't be like that.

434
00:03:33,084 --> 00:03:37,583
- Don't be like what?
- You know very well.

435
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:45,916
It's your fault!

436
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:59,708
You seem to be searching
my expression

437
00:03:59,876 --> 00:04:02,958
to decide the appropriate attitude.

438
00:04:08,876 --> 00:04:13,375
"The private plane awaited
in the blue sky.

439
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:21,750
Rex noticed something about Paula
that he knew already, her face...

440
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:27,625
Her harmonious face,
now indecisive, seemed contorted.

441
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:34,000
Rex knew this trait of hers,
for it seemed that whenever Paula...

442
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:38,208
Whenever Paula
had to make a decision...

443
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:51,416
that went against her nature..."

444
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:57,916
What's got into you?
I love you exactly as before.

445
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:17,541
What would you do
if I stopped loving you?

446
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:22,208
- I already told you.
- I forgot what you said.

447
00:05:22,376 --> 00:05:26,750
I wouldn't do the script
and we'd sell the flat.

448
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:39,666
But I love you.
I find this all so idiotic.

449
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:46,541
When Prokosch calls,
tell him you'll go to Capri.

450
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:04,000
- What about you?
- I love you. Don't make me repeat it.

451
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:07,333
I want to keep the flat.

452
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:10,750
If you don't want to do the script,
don't do it.

453
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:15,458
If you think I've stopped loving you,
you're wrong.

454
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:20,791
Kiss me.

455
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:52,958
We were just talking about you.

456
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:02,333
About your movie.

457
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:07,791
Yes, The Odyssey.
About that guy who travels.

458
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:14,958
In Capri,
can we go swimming?

459
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:21,875
I don't know.

460
00:07:25,626 --> 00:07:29,041
Here's Paul. I'll put him on.

461
00:07:35,917 --> 00:07:39,333
Mr. Prokosch? Yes.

462
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:45,583
No.

463
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:01,083
We're eating out?

464
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:05,083
I don't feel like
going out for groceries.

465
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:15,750
Fine. We're to meet Prokosch
and Lang at a cinema.

466
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:19,875
They want to see a singer
in the stage show. We can eat after.

467
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:23,041
It'll be late if there's a movie first.

468
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:26,791
It might give me some ideas.

469
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:36,041
Why not look for ideas in your head,
instead of stealing them?

470
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:42,041
- What's got into you?
- Let's get going!

471
00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:47,958
I knew it. Since I said yes
to Prokosch, it's no more tenderness!

472
00:08:48,126 --> 00:08:54,541
Right, no more caresses.
What was the phone call about?

473
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:58,541
- Our going to Capri.
- What did you say?

474
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:04,125
- That it was up to you.
- Are you nuts?

475
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:08,291
You know that it's up to you, not me!

476
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:12,416
- Then come to Capri.
- No.

477
00:09:12,584 --> 00:09:16,250
Is there something
between you and Prokosch?

478
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:19,458
You're pathetic.

479
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:30,916
- Sit down. I have to talk to you.
- What about the cinema?

480
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:33,833
Camille, I need to talk to you.

481
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:40,208
All right, I'm listening.

482
00:09:40,376 --> 00:09:45,250
I need... to talk to you.

483
00:09:49,334 --> 00:09:53,375
Earlier, before the phone rang,

484
00:09:54,667 --> 00:10:00,666
I said I didn't want to take this job
if I couldn't be sure of your love.

485
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:09,208
You said you loved me
and that I should take it.

486
00:10:10,334 --> 00:10:13,125
Yes.

487
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:16,916
I'm sure you lied.

488
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:24,750
Why? I don't know.
Out of pity, self-interest...

489
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:31,833
- What self-interest?
- You holding on to this flat.

490
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:35,250
How can you know what I think?

491
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:42,083
In fact, I couldn't care less.
You can sell the flat, I don't care.

492
00:10:42,251 --> 00:10:45,541
You said it was better than a hotel.

493
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:51,750
Not at all.
I said that to make you happy.

494
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:58,166
That's beside the point.
I want to know why you lied earlier.

495
00:10:58,334 --> 00:11:00,708
Who said I lied? Stop it!

496
00:11:00,876 --> 00:11:04,416
You did. You've stopped loving me.

497
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:08,208
What good will
knowing the truth do you?

498
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,000
See? You admit I'm right.

499
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:15,583
I'm not admitting anything.
Leave me alone.

500
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:21,500
It's true. I don't love you anymore.

501
00:11:25,042 --> 00:11:28,333
There's nothing to explain.
I don't love you.

502
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:33,166
Why? Yesterday you still loved me.

503
00:11:33,334 --> 00:11:37,375
Yes, very much.

504
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:41,000
Now it's over.

505
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:47,916
- There must be a reason.
- Yes, there must be.

506
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:50,166
What is it?

507
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:55,541
I don't know. All I know is
I don't love you anymore.

508
00:11:56,584 --> 00:11:59,375
Since we were at Prokosch's?

509
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:04,125
When you saw me pat
Francesca Vanini's bottom?

510
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:13,041
Let's say it was that.
It's over now. Let's drop the subject.

511
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:19,291
Something's happened
since this morning.

512
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:25,416
It changed your mind about me,
and therefore, your love for me.

513
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:32,583
- You're nuts, but you're clever.
- Then it's true.

514
00:12:38,876 --> 00:12:45,125
I didn't say that.
I said you're clever.

515
00:12:46,376 --> 00:12:50,666
Was it something I said or did today
that you took the wrong way?

516
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:52,625
Maybe.

517
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:57,208
Don't talk to me like that!
I won't allow it!

518
00:13:06,126 --> 00:13:08,416
Camille!

519
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:18,916
I despise you! That's what I feel.

520
00:13:19,084 --> 00:13:22,166
That's why the love's gone.

521
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:26,041
And you disgust me when you touch me.

522
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:41,666
Wait for me. Don't be so dramatic.

523
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:51,000
Forget what I said, Paul.
Pretend nothing happened.

524
00:14:54,751 --> 00:14:57,125
Good evening.

525
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:08,583
- Are you going to Capri, too?
- Maybe.

526
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:34,083
Are you okay?

527
00:16:37,584 --> 00:16:40,625
Mr. Prokosch re-read Homer.

528
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:50,208
He found something
he had long been searching for.

529
00:16:56,667 --> 00:17:02,541
Something as indispensable
to the movies as to real life.

530
00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:04,500
Poetry.

531
00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:10,708
- You remember...
- Oh, yes.

532
00:17:12,751 --> 00:17:16,583
They say Ulysses came home
to Penelope,

533
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:20,041
but maybe Ulysses had been
fed up with Penelope.

534
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:25,625
So he went off to the Trojan war, and
since he didn't feel like going home,

535
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:28,375
he kept travelling as long as he could.

536
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:32,291
Do you think it was
an idea of his or...?

537
00:17:42,251 --> 00:17:46,416
- Why do you despise me?
- Leave me alone!

538
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:04,625
Coming to Capri with us, Mr. Lang?

539
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:12,041
"Each morning, to earn my bread
I go to the market where lies are sold

540
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:16,916
and, full of hope, I line up
alongside the other vendors."

541
00:18:17,084 --> 00:18:20,750
- What's that?
- Hollywood.

542
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:24,041
From a ballad by poor B.B.

543
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:28,083
- Bertolt Brecht?
- Yes.

544
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:41,375
Homer's world is a real world.

545
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:45,000
And the poet belonged to a civilization

546
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:51,750
that grew in harmony,
not in opposition, with nature.

547
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:54,541
And the beauty of The Odyssey

548
00:18:54,709 --> 00:19:01,291
lies precisely in this belief
in reality as it is.

549
00:19:01,459 --> 00:19:04,750
Thus in reality
as it appears objectively.

550
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:11,708
Exactly. And in a form
that cannot be broken down.

551
00:19:11,876 --> 00:19:16,208
And is what it is.
Take it or leave it.

552
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:23,291
I shut up because I have nothing to say.

553
00:19:36,459 --> 00:19:41,416
I'm not sure about going to Capri.
Where would we stay?

554
00:19:44,459 --> 00:19:47,875
In Mr. Prokosch's villa.

555
00:19:50,334 --> 00:19:55,083
- With your husband.
- And Mr. Lang too?

556
00:19:59,042 --> 00:20:00,916
That's up to him.

557
00:20:01,084 --> 00:20:06,500
Producers are something
I can easily do without.

558
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:09,750
- Madam.
- Goodnight.

559
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:40,125
If you don't want to come,
I'm not forcing you.

560
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:45,875
It's not you that's forcing me.
It's life.

561
00:21:14,417 --> 00:21:17,458
What are you doing?

562
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:24,291
- What are you doing?
- Looking.

563
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:28,291
Don't stay by yourself. Join us.

564
00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:33,166
- What were you talking about?
- The Odyssey.

565
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:38,708
- I agree with Prokosch's theory.
- What theory's that?

566
00:21:38,876 --> 00:21:43,875
That Ulysses loves his wife,
but she doesn't love him.

567
00:21:45,126 --> 00:21:50,958
Do you really think that?
I'm sure you don't.

568
00:21:57,084 --> 00:22:01,875
- Please, you're in the frame.
- Places, everyone!

569
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:47,000
Are they going to strip off?
Marvellous business this!

570
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:52,541
You show women in dresses a camera,
and hey presto! They strip off!

571
00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:08,666
Come with us, madam,
leave them here to talk.

572
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:12,000
No, I'll walk back later
with my husband.

573
00:23:18,001 --> 00:23:23,208
He says you spend all day
with your husband.

574
00:23:25,626 --> 00:23:28,958
Do you mind if you wife comes with us?

575
00:23:29,126 --> 00:23:34,416
Not at all. Go on, Camille.
Go on.

576
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:42,291
I don't mind, go on.

577
00:23:42,459 --> 00:23:47,125
I'll walk back with Mr. Lang
to discuss The Odyssey.

578
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:24,416
The girls are in the water, Mr Lang.

579
00:24:24,584 --> 00:24:27,708
I should have done a scene
at the beginning

580
00:24:27,876 --> 00:24:34,500
in which the gods
discuss man's fate, in general,

581
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:38,125
and the fate of Ulysses in particular.

582
00:25:14,001 --> 00:25:17,833
A producer
can be a friend to a director.

583
00:25:18,001 --> 00:25:23,875
But Prokosch isn't a real producer.
He's a dictator.

584
00:25:24,042 --> 00:25:29,416
I think it's stupid to change
the character of Ulysses.

585
00:25:29,584 --> 00:25:33,250
He's not a modern-day neurotic,

586
00:25:33,417 --> 00:25:39,125
but a simple, clever and robust man.

587
00:25:39,292 --> 00:25:42,250
I find his idea interesting.

588
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:45,541
It takes Ulysses
ten years to return home

589
00:25:45,709 --> 00:25:49,541
because he doesn't really
want to return. It's logical.

590
00:25:49,709 --> 00:25:55,791
It's logical, and the illogical
borrows from the logical.

591
00:25:55,959 --> 00:26:00,458
Your Corneille said it
in his preface to Suréna.

592
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:05,291
Ulysses doesn't rush home to Ithaca

593
00:26:05,459 --> 00:26:09,375
because he was unhappy
with Penelope,

594
00:26:09,542 --> 00:26:14,125
but the trouble started
before he went off to war.

595
00:26:20,209 --> 00:26:23,666
He never would've left
if he'd been happy.

596
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:27,333
The Trojan war was his excuse
to get away from her.

597
00:26:27,501 --> 00:26:31,500
But he killed her suitors, didn't he?

598
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:35,958
That can be justified
by the fact that, at first,

599
00:26:36,126 --> 00:26:40,333
Ulysses had told Penelope
to accept their gifts.

600
00:26:40,501 --> 00:26:44,333
He didn't see the suitors
as serious rivals,

601
00:26:44,501 --> 00:26:48,291
and didn't want to cause a scandal
by throwing them out.

602
00:26:48,459 --> 00:26:55,000
Knowing Penelope to be faithful,
he told her to be nice to the suitors.

603
00:27:01,834 --> 00:27:08,458
I think that's when Penelope,
who is a simple woman at heart,

604
00:27:09,626 --> 00:27:12,750
began to despise him.

605
00:27:12,917 --> 00:27:17,916
She found she'd stopped loving
Ulysses because of his behaviour,

606
00:27:18,084 --> 00:27:20,541
and she told him so.

607
00:27:20,709 --> 00:27:25,208
Ulysses then realized too late
he'd lost Penelope's love

608
00:27:25,376 --> 00:27:29,208
because he'd been overly cautious.

609
00:27:30,251 --> 00:27:35,458
The only way to win her back
was to murder the suitors.

610
00:27:35,626 --> 00:27:39,083
Death is no resolution.

611
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:15,125
Camille!

612
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:27,500
- What a lovely yellow.
- Thanks.

613
00:30:29,834 --> 00:30:32,625
I found this on the boat.

614
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:36,500
Children shouldn't play with firearms.

615
00:31:24,292 --> 00:31:26,375
Drink?

616
00:31:26,542 --> 00:31:30,583
I was there, outside. Nothing.

617
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:08,416
I decided not to write
the script you asked me.

618
00:32:11,084 --> 00:32:13,708
Why?

619
00:32:13,876 --> 00:32:17,125
Can I be frank?

620
00:32:21,126 --> 00:32:23,750
Of course.

621
00:32:27,042 --> 00:32:32,625
I'm a playwright.
Not a screenwriter.

622
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:43,500
Even if it's a fine script...
I'm only doing it for the money!

623
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:53,791
That's why I'm in a bad mood.

624
00:32:56,334 --> 00:33:01,416
We all have an ideal.
Mine's writing plays. I can't. Why?

625
00:33:03,584 --> 00:33:08,708
In today's world,
we have to accept what others want.

626
00:33:10,876 --> 00:33:13,833
Why does money matter so much
in what we do,

627
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:16,958
in what we are, in what we become?

628
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:22,333
Even in our relationships
with those we love.

629
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:34,666
He is right.

630
00:33:36,001 --> 00:33:39,958
We either do Homer's Odyssey
or we do nothing!

631
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:49,708
Mr. Prokosch already said it,
you're wrong.

632
00:33:49,876 --> 00:33:53,000
You aspire to a world like Homer's.

633
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:56,833
You want it to exist,
but unfortunately it doesn't.

634
00:33:57,001 --> 00:34:00,125
Why doesn't it?

635
00:34:07,042 --> 00:34:09,958
You may be right,

636
00:34:10,126 --> 00:34:15,958
but when it comes to making movies,
dreams aren't enough.

637
00:34:22,834 --> 00:34:25,583
When do we eat?

638
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:33,708
- In an hour.
- Right. I'm going for a walk.

639
00:34:42,626 --> 00:34:45,083
Mr. Prokosch wants to speak with you.

640
00:34:50,709 --> 00:34:56,000
- Is that an order or a request?
- A request.

641
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:05,208
One must suffer.

642
00:35:07,209 --> 00:35:09,833
That's for sure.

643
00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:23,625
Camille!

644
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,791
It's me, Paul.

645
00:36:18,792 --> 00:36:23,916
Looking at you just now,
felt like the first time I'd seen you.

646
00:36:35,959 --> 00:36:41,291
- Mind if I stay?
- Stay if you like.

647
00:37:01,084 --> 00:37:04,208
Why didn't you speak up earlier?

648
00:37:04,376 --> 00:37:08,541
I don't get you! You always said
you loved that script.

649
00:37:08,709 --> 00:37:14,666
Now you tell the producer it's for the
money, that your ideal is the theatre.

650
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:20,708
He's no fool.
Next time, he won't be asking you.

651
00:37:20,876 --> 00:37:25,541
How can you not understand
something so simple?

652
00:37:27,626 --> 00:37:32,291
- I bet you'll do it anyway.
- No.

653
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:37,375
Yes, you'll see. I know you.

654
00:37:39,584 --> 00:37:41,666
I know you.

655
00:37:41,834 --> 00:37:46,708
If I do it, it's for you.
To pay for the flat.

656
00:37:46,876 --> 00:37:50,666
I'll let you decide
whether I do the script or not.

657
00:37:50,834 --> 00:37:54,500
If you say no, we'll leave.

658
00:37:54,667 --> 00:37:59,000
- You're so cunning!
- Not at all. Why?

659
00:37:59,167 --> 00:38:04,916
- If you regret it, you can blame me.
- Not at all! I'm asking you to decide.

660
00:38:05,084 --> 00:38:07,666
You want me to tell you what to do?

661
00:38:07,834 --> 00:38:11,125
- Yes.
- Then do the script!

662
00:38:11,292 --> 00:38:15,208
You signed a contract,
and you're boring me.

663
00:38:18,084 --> 00:38:22,666
- I saw him kiss you earlier.
- I know you did.

664
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:30,791
- Why don't you love me anymore?
- That's life.

665
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:35,583
Why do you despise me?

666
00:38:35,751 --> 00:38:40,041
I'll never tell you,
not even if I were dying.

667
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:49,791
- Tell me or I'll hurt you.
- Why hurt me more?

668
00:38:53,001 --> 00:38:56,041
I have to know why you despise me.

669
00:38:56,209 --> 00:39:01,583
It's crazy! I don't see why
you expect me to accept, anyway.

670
00:39:01,751 --> 00:39:06,083
We need the money for the flat.
I don't want to go back to typing.

671
00:39:06,251 --> 00:39:12,000
I can't accept that after what happened.
Obviously you do despise me.

672
00:39:28,626 --> 00:39:32,791
You knew we kissed and you were
still ready to change your mind.

673
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:39,041
I turned the job down for you.
So you'd change your mind about me.

674
00:39:39,209 --> 00:39:43,875
Don't touch me.
I don't love you anymore.

675
00:39:44,042 --> 00:39:48,041
There's no way
I'll ever love you again.

676
00:39:48,209 --> 00:39:51,708
Even if I turn it down,
you'll despise me?

677
00:39:51,876 --> 00:39:57,625
- Yes, I will.
- Why? There must be a reason.

678
00:39:57,792 --> 00:40:03,291
- You're the reason.
- What do you mean, me?

679
00:40:03,459 --> 00:40:06,750
I don't know. You're not a man.

680
00:40:07,792 --> 00:40:13,416
Anyhow, it's too late.
I've changed my mind about you.

681
00:40:14,876 --> 00:40:20,166
I know why you despise me.
The other day, when I took a taxi,

682
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:25,208
you thought I wanted you
to go in his car with him.

683
00:40:26,709 --> 00:40:30,333
And again on the boat earlier.
Don't be stupid!

684
00:40:30,501 --> 00:40:32,791
I have faults, but that's not one.

685
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:38,958
I'll never forgive you.
I loved you so much.

686
00:40:41,251 --> 00:40:48,208
Now it's impossible. I hate you
because you can't make me feel.

687
00:40:48,376 --> 00:40:51,500
I can! You're almost in tears.

688
00:41:03,792 --> 00:41:07,333
We're leaving! We'll pack up and go.

689
00:41:07,501 --> 00:41:11,958
I'm staying. You go if you like.

690
00:41:12,126 --> 00:41:15,166
Come on, Camille!

691
00:41:16,626 --> 00:41:20,083
- No.
- Then I'm staying, too.

692
00:41:20,251 --> 00:41:26,375
- But Prokosch will throw us out.
- Don't start again.

693
00:42:07,417 --> 00:42:12,291
Dear Paul, I found your revolver
and took the bullets out.

694
00:42:12,459 --> 00:42:15,875
If you won't leave, I will.

695
00:42:16,042 --> 00:42:21,458
Jeremy Prokosch has to return to Rome,
so I'll get a lift with him.

696
00:42:21,626 --> 00:42:25,625
Then I'll probably move
into a hotel alone.

697
00:42:25,792 --> 00:42:29,916
Take care. Farewell. Camille.

698
00:43:08,626 --> 00:43:12,375
What are you going to do in Rome?

699
00:43:14,334 --> 00:43:17,125
Typist.

700
00:43:22,292 --> 00:43:25,041
Me? No.

701
00:43:25,959 --> 00:43:28,541
Typist.

702
00:43:52,626 --> 00:43:57,791
What... do you think... of me?

703
00:43:58,876 --> 00:44:03,166
Get into your Alfa, Romeo.
We'll see about that later.

704
00:44:03,334 --> 00:44:08,333
TAKE CARE

705
00:44:14,792 --> 00:44:19,458
FAREWELL

706
00:45:17,417 --> 00:45:21,041
Nathalie,
I'm leaving for Rome tonight.

707
00:45:21,209 --> 00:45:24,250
Good-bye, then.

708
00:46:05,459 --> 00:46:09,750
Mr. Lang,
I've come to say good-bye.

709
00:46:09,917 --> 00:46:13,291
Good-bye. What will you do?

710
00:46:13,459 --> 00:46:18,166
Go back to Rome, finish my play.

711
00:46:19,292 --> 00:46:22,250
- And you?
- I'll finish the film.

712
00:46:22,417 --> 00:46:26,541
One should always finish
what one starts.

713
00:46:26,709 --> 00:46:29,541
What shot are you doing?

714
00:46:29,709 --> 00:46:34,583
Ulysses' gaze when he first sees
his homeland again.

715
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:38,208
Ithaca.

716
00:46:39,917 --> 00:46:44,333
- Good-bye, Mr. Lang.
- Bye. I hope we'll meet again.

717
00:46:48,042 --> 00:46:50,666
We're ready, Mr. Lang.

718
00:46:50,834 --> 00:46:53,916
Quiet on the set!

719
00:46:55,542 --> 00:46:58,416
Camera!

720
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:53,750
Silence!

721
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,063
