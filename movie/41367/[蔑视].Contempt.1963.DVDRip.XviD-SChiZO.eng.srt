1
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:51,408
CONTEMPT

2
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,426
It's based on the novel
by Alberto Moravia.

3
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,897
It features Brigitte Bardot
and Michel Piccoli.

4
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:15,072
Jack Palance and Giorgia Moll, too.

5
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:21,271
And Fritz Lang.

6
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,051
Raoul Coutard did the photography.

7
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,854
Georges Delerue wrote the score.

8
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,526
The sound was recorded
by William Sivel.

9
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:46,999
Agnes Guillemot did the editing.

10
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:53,868
Philippe Dussart and Carlo Lastricati
were unit managers.

11
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,914
It's a film byJean-Luc Godard.

12
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:06,116
It was shot in CinemaScope
and printed in color by GTC Labs.

13
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:11,359
Georges de Beauregard
and Carlo Ponti produced it

14
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:16,595
for Rome-Paris Films, Films Concordia
and Compagnia Cinematografia Champion.

15
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:28,606
"The cinema, "said Andre Bazin,
"substitutes for our gaze

16
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:31,275
a world more in harmony
with our desires. "

17
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:36,278
Contempt is a story of that world.

18
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,198
I don't know.

19
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:58,572
Maybe I'll go to Mom's.
I don't know what I'll do later.

20
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,415
Come pick me up if you want.

21
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:05,784
Around 4 o'clock.

22
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,610
At Cinecitta.

23
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,752
I have to see that American.

24
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,960
Maybe I will.

25
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,028
See my feet in the mirror?

26
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,368
Think they're pretty?

27
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,470
Very.

28
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,475
You like my ankles?

29
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,886
And my knees, too?

30
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,528
I really like your knees.

31
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,558
And my thighs?

32
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,467
Your thighs, too.

33
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,110
See my behind in the mirror?

34
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:17,519
Do you think I have a cute ass?

35
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,990
Really.

36
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:27,355
Shall I get on my knees?

37
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,163
No need to.

38
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:35,431
And my breasts. You like them?

39
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:39,136
Yes, tremendously.

40
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,207
Gently, Paul. Not so hard.

41
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,812
Sorry.

42
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,387
Which do you like better,

43
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,558
my breasts,

44
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,624
or my nipples?

45
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:02,392
I don't know.
I like them the same.

46
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:08,437
You like my shoulders?

47
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,345
I don't think they're round enough.

48
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,953
And my arms?

49
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,463
And my face?

50
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,197
Your face, too.

51
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:38,861
All of it?

52
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,771
My mouth, my eyes, my nose, my ears?

53
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,268
Yes, everything.

54
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,607
Then you love me totally.

55
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:57,353
I love you totally,
tenderly, tragically.

56
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,224
Me too, Paul.

57
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,026
- Hello. How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

58
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,534
Say, what's going on here?
The place is empty!

59
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,831
Jerry fired nearly everybody.

60
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,269
Italian cinema is in trouble.

61
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,071
- Where is he?
- Over there.

62
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,770
Where?

63
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,685
It's the end of cinema.

64
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,417
I don't think cinema will ever die.

65
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:53,631
- It's doing good business in N.Y.
- Fair to middling.

66
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,114
Your film with Fritz Lang?

67
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,987
He's not working out.

68
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,530
Producers never know what they want.

69
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:41,313
In '33, Goebbels asked Lang
to head the German film industry.

70
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,939
That very night, Lang left Germany.

71
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,834
That's Minerva, isn't it?

72
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,470
She's Ulysses' protector.

73
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:06,315
And that's Neptune, his mortal enemy.

74
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:15,109
Say, that's Homer.

75
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,853
That's art,
but will the public understand?

76
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,332
Who's that?

77
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:02,923
Penelope.

78
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:39,200
"O my brothers,
who braved 1 00,000 perils

79
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,666
to reach the west,

80
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,967
choose not to deny experience

81
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,338
of the unpeopled world.

82
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,411
Think of the seed of your creation.

83
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:53,143
You were not born
to live as brutes,

84
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:56,187
but to follow virtue and knowledge."

85
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:00,815
Know it?

86
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:03,793
Sure, it's very famous. Dante.

87
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,990
"Night then saw all the stars.

88
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:23,307
We were filled with gladness,
which soon turned to tears

89
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:28,686
until the sea closed in upon us."

90
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:35,711
I'm PaulJaval. Mr. Prokosch told you...

91
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,584
I'm perfectly aware.

92
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,990
It looks swell.
I really like CinemaScope.

93
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,327
It wasn't made for people.

94
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:46,796
It's only good for snakes and funerals.

95
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:14,020
What's the matter, Miss Vanini?
Is it about the script?

96
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:48,825
Oh, he's says it's not the same
on screen as on paper.

97
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,370
My wife's meeting me here.
I'll go see.

98
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:24,419
The Italians used to say "revolver"

99
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,988
instead of"checkbook."

100
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,723
"But Man, when he must,

101
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,027
Can stand fearless and alone before God

102
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,691
His candor is his shield

103
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,094
He needs neither arms nor wile

104
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,326
Until such time
as God's absence helps him."

105
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,795
Fine.

106
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,237
That's Holderlin, isn't it?

107
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,208
"The Poet's Vocation."

108
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:49,710
The final line is obscure.
Holderlin originally wrote...

109
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,616
"So long as God is not absent."

110
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:59,387
And then...

111
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,892
"So long as God is close to us."

112
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:09,734
Yes. The way the last lines are written,

113
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,269
when you've read the other two,

114
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:16,507
is no longer about God's presence.

115
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:19,839
It's God's absence that reassures Man.

116
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,912
Strange, but true.

117
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,342
How do you say "strange" in Italian?

118
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:26,102
Meet Mr. Prokosch.
Camille, my wife.

119
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:37,180
I'd like you to meet my wife, Camille.

120
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:44,056
He's the one who did
that western with Dietrich.

121
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:45,789
It was terrific!

122
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:47,455
I prefer M.

123
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:48,555
Your M?

124
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,659
We just saw it on TV. I really liked it.

125
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,100
Thank you. That's kind of you.

126
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,266
I love the scene

127
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,970
when Ferrer leans on the scale.

128
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:03,076
Thank you.
When I finish The Odyssey...

129
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,498
Me?

130
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,509
I'll phone you.

131
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:46,715
We'll go if you want.

132
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,594
Sit down, ma'am.

133
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,869
I'll meet you there.

134
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,801
I'll grab a taxi.

135
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,900
Let him go on ahead.
We can both take a cab.

136
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,274
Make up your mind.

137
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,752
What's the address?

138
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:08,622
What did he say?

139
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,264
I know as much English as you do.

140
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:20,606
We've been waiting a half hour.
What kept you?

141
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,853
Nothing. I had an accident...

142
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:38,588
I was in the cab,
and just at the corner...

143
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:42,229
the "corner" of the street...

144
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:45,298
Two cars, you know...

145
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:47,803
The entire fender was torn off.

146
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:51,307
The two drivers
started trading insults...

147
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:57,145
So I found another cab.
That's why...

148
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:59,148
That's why, what?

149
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,986
What?
Why I got here late.

150
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:06,518
I had to walk God knows how long...

151
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:10,122
From S. Angelo to Piazza Venezia
to find a cab.

152
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:29,070
Anyway, I don't give a damn.
I'm not interested in your story.

153
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,279
Still, it took me 20 minutes.

154
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,791
You don't believe me.
- We'll discuss it later.

155
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:47,431
I'm going for a walk.

156
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:32,834
All right.

157
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,105
Why don't you say something?

158
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,492
Friday we shoot in Capri.
Come with us.

159
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:31,662
Answer her.
Why don't you speak up?

160
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,706
What were you doing
before I arrived?

161
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,640
Nothing special.

162
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:42,205
Why? Did he come on to you?

163
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:47,181
- Why ask me that?
- Just because.

164
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,890
I'll go wash my hands.

165
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:07,803
- Where can I wash?
- Upstairs, right.

166
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,407
What's the matter?
You look down.

167
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,008
Nothing.

168
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,582
Have you been crying?

169
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,621
Your boss is tough.

170
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:32,852
He is.

171
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,559
Known him long?

172
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,270
What did he do before movies?

173
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,334
I don't want to talk about it.

174
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:50,477
I was just asking.

175
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:55,843
It's a drag to be so cute
and so sad.

176
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:59,114
Haven't you anything
more amusing to say?

177
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:02,316
More amusing...

178
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:06,730
Ajoke.

179
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,498
Which one?

180
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:17,932
Sure, the one about Rama Krishna
and his disciple.

181
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:27,942
Rama Krishna is a Hindu sage.

182
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,847
He has this disciple

183
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:34,386
who doesn't believe
in his master's teachings.

184
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,158
He decides to study on his own.

185
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:40,060
So he goes away.

186
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:44,865
After 1 5 years, he comes back
and says: "I've found it!"

187
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:47,104
Found what?

188
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:50,505
He tells the sage: "I'll show you."

189
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:52,940
He takes him to the riverbank.

190
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:57,611
The disciple walks back and forth
across the water.

191
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:02,617
And he says: "You see?
I can cross without getting wet.

192
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,816
Now I know!"

193
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:08,188
So Rama Krishna replies:

194
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:13,253
"You fool! I did that 1 0 years ago
with a rupee and a rowboat!"

195
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:20,928
Feel better now?

196
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,367
That's good.

197
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:27,374
What?

198
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,409
Call that washing your hands?

199
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:34,007
As you can see.

200
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:37,651
I was just telling her the joke...

201
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:39,723
I believe you already.

202
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:42,083
You're being an idiot.

203
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,022
Where can I pee?

204
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:17,821
Tell them we're leaving.

205
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,145
It's my husband who decides.

206
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,245
Like in the United Artists days.

207
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:54,811
He's crazy!

208
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,887
See that? He kicked her!

209
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:03,260
You change your mind fast.
Monday you thought he was terrific.

210
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:14,196
Now I think he's a jerk.

211
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,005
I have a right to change my mind.

212
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,141
What happened in the past hour?

213
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:28,307
Nothing.

214
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,620
If you're happy, so am I.

215
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,580
Rio Bravo is playing in town.

216
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:04,813
So is Nicholas Ray's
Bigger Than Life.

217
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:06,787
I'm not interested.

218
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,225
- I wrote it.
- I know.

219
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:17,734
I phoned your mom's at lunchtime.
There was no answer.

220
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:21,138
We ate here.
I didn't feel like going out.

221
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,271
I prefer it here.

222
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,112
It's better than a hotel.

223
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:33,240
See? I was right.

224
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:38,387
What are they paying for the script?

225
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:41,320
$1 0,000. Six million lire.

226
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,861
We can finish paying off the flat.
Isn't that great?

227
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,889
Yes, it's great.

228
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:03,070
When will you call your friend
about the curtains?

229
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:05,314
I've about had it!

230
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,407
Once he's back from Spain.

231
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,452
Roberto said he'd be back Friday.

232
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,152
Red velvet.
It's that or nothing.

233
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:21,455
Okay.

234
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:24,660
Set the table while I take a bath?

235
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:28,234
I wanted to take a bath, too.

236
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,274
You go first.
I can do some work.

237
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:38,012
No, I'll go later, while it's cooking.

238
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,209
Is there any faggiolini left?

239
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,816
Don't like it? That's tough.

240
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:49,125
I can set the table.

241
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:50,955
I was just doing it.

242
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:33,696
I bought something today.

243
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,931
You'll tell me what you think.

244
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:38,331
What thing?

245
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,816
What thing?

246
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:49,076
Don't look yet.

247
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,083
You want to go to Capri?

248
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,955
What?

249
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,329
You want us to go to Capri?

250
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:10,636
I won't say no,
but I won't say yes either.

251
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:13,005
It would be a vacation.

252
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,574
Besides, he didn't invite me.

253
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,716
What?

254
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:23,917
He invited you.

255
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,719
Not me.

256
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,289
Where'd we put the mirror?

257
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:56,513
Not at all.
We were both invited.

258
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:00,950
Look.

259
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:06,894
Doesn't it suit me?

260
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:09,158
No, I prefer you as a blonde.

261
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,129
And I prefer you
without a hat and cigar.

262
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:17,670
It's just to look like Dean Martin
in Some Came Running.

263
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:22,143
- What a laugh!
- What is?

264
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:25,847
You may want to look
like Dean Martin,

265
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,914
but it's more like Martin's Ass.

266
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,646
Who's that?

267
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:33,348
Never read the adventures
of Martin's Ass?

268
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:39,456
One day he goes to Baghdad
to buy a flying carpet.

269
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:42,930
He finds this really pretty one,

270
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:47,335
so he sits on it, but it doesn't fly.

271
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,871
The merchant says: "Not surprising."

272
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:51,834
Are you listening?

273
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:55,272
"Not surprising.

274
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:58,246
If you want it to fly,
you mustn't think of an ass."

275
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:01,915
So Martin says:
"Okay, I won't think of an ass."

276
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:06,750
But automatically he thinks of one,
so the carpet doesn't fly.

277
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:09,149
What's that got to do with me?

278
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:13,623
Exactly what I was saying.

279
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:16,028
Well, I don't get it.

280
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:23,239
That's enough.
Are you finished?

281
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:26,937
No need to change the water.
I didn't use soap.

282
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:40,251
You've been acting weird today.
What's wrong?

283
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,983
Nothing at all.

284
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,756
I knew you'd say that.

285
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:49,926
There is something.
Is it that girl?

286
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:55,128
It's nothing, I tell you.
I simply said you were an ass.

287
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,842
Not the same sound all over.

288
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:09,478
Why don't you want us to go to Capri?

289
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,989
Because you're an ass.

290
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:24,391
You frighten me, Paul.

291
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,534
It's not the first time.

292
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:32,267
Why didn't you answer
instead of standing there?

293
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:35,140
Why'd I marry a 28-year-old typist?

294
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:38,941
It's true...

295
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,880
I'm sorry.

296
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:46,249
So am I.

297
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:03,304
Go to Capri if you want.
I don't feel like it.

298
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:09,337
Besides, I don't like
thatJeremy Prokosch. I told you.

299
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:12,808
Why? He do something to you?

300
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:15,946
Not a thing.

301
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:33,332
Why the thoughtful air?

302
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:37,730
Maybe because I'm thinking
of something.

303
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:42,135
That surprise you?

304
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:43,838
No. Why?

305
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,877
An idea.

306
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:49,680
Come with me.
I don't want to go alone.

307
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,089
You've been acting funny
since we met that guy.

308
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,758
No, I'm not funny.

309
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:07,300
I wonder why you say that.

310
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:09,129
Just because.

311
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:11,397
We were fine this morning.

312
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:14,376
And now we're fighting over nothing.

313
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:17,604
What's going on, sweetie?

314
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:21,173
I want to have fun.
Nothing's going on, Paul.

315
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,951
I'm afraid I'll get bored there.

316
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:28,252
I'm not going.

317
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:31,357
I'm not going.

318
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,778
Seen the house being built
across the way?

319
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:55,546
It's a real horror.

320
00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:00,619
If you love me, just be quiet.

321
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:11,759
A husband has the right to know
why his wife's sulking.

322
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,240
I'm sure it's that girl.

323
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:18,865
Drop dead!

324
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,828
No, Camille isn't here.

325
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:49,103
I thought you'd lunched out
and gone shopping.

326
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:55,678
She just walked in the door!
Your mom.

327
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,422
I'll call you tomorrow.

328
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,955
You're out of your mind, old man!

329
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:49,357
Why tell Mom I was out?

330
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:51,859
I don't know why.

331
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:53,397
I know why.

332
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:57,237
To find out if we really
went out to lunch

333
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:59,741
and if I wasn't lying earlier.

334
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:02,503
That's it.

335
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:05,275
Try that again and I'll divorce you.

336
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:09,008
Get up!

337
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,882
What are you doing?

338
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:15,120
I'm sleeping on the couch.

339
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,353
When, tonight?

340
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,562
Every night, starting tonight.

341
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:34,072
Don't be angry.

342
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:37,042
I just can't sleep
with the window open.

343
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:40,116
We'll close the window.

344
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:44,745
You always say you can't breathe.
No, we'll sleep apart.

345
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:47,855
Thousands of couples do it.

346
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:50,051
They still get along fine.

347
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:53,819
What did I do wrong?
Tell me.

348
00:48:56,199 --> 00:49:00,033
I'm sorry I said you were out.
Is that it? Forgive me.

349
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:01,661
Let me by.

350
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:05,866
Is that why you're in a bad mood?

351
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:08,336
Yes, but I'm not anymore.

352
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:13,514
I'll be just fine here.

353
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:17,379
I really wonder what I did.

354
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:26,623
You're so mean all of a sudden!

355
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:28,793
Me?

356
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:30,833
I'm the same as always.

357
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:35,534
You're the one who's changed.

358
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:44,444
Ever since you've been
with movie people.

359
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:48,843
You used to write crime novels.

360
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,544
We didn't have much money,

361
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,851
but everything was fine.

362
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,226
What's this?
- Give me that.

363
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,963
"Partito Comunista Italiano. "

364
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,997
You never said you joined.

365
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:14,168
That was two months ago in Paris.

366
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:16,745
Give me that.
- Let go! You'll bruise me.

367
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,247
- Don't talk to me like that!
- And don't you either!

368
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:23,511
I'm working for you.
This place is for you, not just for me!

369
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:26,851
Please, Paul, I don't want to argue.

370
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:40,199
I don't want to go to Capri, either.

371
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:44,096
Why not?
Don't be stupid. Go.

372
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:54,044
Paul, come here.

373
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:55,243
What?

374
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:59,248
No, I've lost interest.

375
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:02,418
Tell Prokosch when he calls.
I won't talk to him.

376
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:07,987
Come here.

377
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:14,030
Why won't you do the script now?

378
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:20,037
I'd have done it out of love for you.

379
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:25,675
But you don't love me anymore.

380
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:28,650
That's news!

381
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:38,251
"I hosted a skin contest
among three beauties.

382
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:41,392
They asked me to be the judge.

383
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:44,628
They showed me their dazzling nudity.

384
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:48,436
The first had a gently curving back

385
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:50,403
with round dimples.

386
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:52,805
The second parted her legs,
her snow-white skin

387
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:55,901
grew cherry-red, not crimson.

388
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:59,175
The third was as still as a quiet sea.

389
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:02,376
Her delicate skin rippled gently,

390
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:05,284
shivering involuntarily."

391
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:12,251
We'll just mortgage the flat
when we run out of money.

392
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:18,233
Something makes you think
I've stopped loving you?

393
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:21,500
Yes.

394
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,398
What?

395
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:30,870
Everything.

396
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:33,580
But what, for instance?

397
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:40,681
First tell me if it's true.

398
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:43,917
No, you tell me first.

399
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:48,096
What makes me think
you've stopped loving me?

400
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:50,897
The way you've begun to talk to me.

401
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:54,937
You weren't like that this morning.

402
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:02,606
Or yesterday.

403
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:08,380
It's the way you look at me, too.

404
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,251
"The problem, in my opinion,

405
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:22,957
is in our conception of the world.

406
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,233
A positive view or a negative one.

407
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:29,194
Greek tragedy was negative

408
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:32,605
in that it made Man a victim of Fate,

409
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,609
as embodied by the Gods,

410
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:38,147
who abandoned him
to a hopeless destiny."

411
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,647
Why'd you say it was the open window?

412
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,885
There's something else.

413
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:50,526
I think so.

414
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:55,892
"Man can rebel against things
that are bad, false.

415
00:53:56,466 --> 00:54:01,335
We must rebel when we're trapped
by circumstances, conventions.

416
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:05,602
But I don't think murder is a solution.

417
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:09,372
Crimes of passion serve no purpose.

418
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:14,443
I love a woman, she cheats on me,
I kill her.

419
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:17,244
What's left for me?

420
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:19,788
I lost the one I love,
since she's dead.

421
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:24,322
If I kill her lover, she hates me,
and I still lose her.

422
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:28,020
Killing is never a solution."

423
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,533
Look, Camille...

424
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:34,463
I'm telling you, I give you my word,

425
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:36,903
I can't sleep with the window open.

426
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:42,133
I need peace and quiet and darkness.

427
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:45,840
I swear it's true.

428
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:53,718
And you move around too much.
You keep waking me.

429
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:56,555
I want to sleep alone from now on.

430
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:00,753
You don't want to make love?

431
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:06,731
Listen to the jerk.

432
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:11,338
Is that a mocking smile
or a tender smile?

433
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:16,001
A tender smile.

434
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:20,779
So, answer me!

435
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:23,079
If it were true, I'd tell you.

436
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:26,644
A woman can always find
an excuse not to make love.

437
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:28,824
But you're really a jerk.

438
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:31,923
Vulgar language doesn't suit you.

439
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:35,264
It doesn't suit me?

440
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:39,628
Listen to this...

441
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:42,694
Asshole.

442
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:44,729
Cunt.

443
00:55:45,408 --> 00:55:47,069
Shit.

444
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:50,275
Christ almighty.

445
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:53,578
Craphole.

446
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:56,851
Son of a bitch.

447
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,213
Goddamn.

448
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:06,653
So,

449
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:09,027
still think it doesn't suit me?

450
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:35,950
Why don't you want
to make love anymore?

451
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:47,494
All right.

452
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:51,068
Let's do it, but fast.

453
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:57,078
I'd been thinking
Camille could leave me.

454
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,341
I thought of it as a possible disaster.

455
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:01,717
Now the disaster had happened.

456
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:07,117
We used to live
in a cloud of unawareness,

457
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,884
in delicious complicity.

458
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:14,994
Things happened with sudden,
wild, enchanted recklessness.

459
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:20,595
I'd end up in Paul's arms,
hardly aware of what had happened.

460
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:26,540
This recklessness was now absent
in Camille, and thus in me.

461
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:31,373
Could I now, prey to my excited senses,
observe her coldly,

462
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:34,177
as she could undoubtedly observe me?

463
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:37,952
I deliberately made that remark

464
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:40,488
with a secret feeling of revenge.

465
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:44,184
She seemed aware
that a lie could settle things.

466
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,728
For a while, at least.

467
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:49,462
She was clearly tempted to lie.

468
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:52,791
But on second thought,
she decided not to.

469
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:55,437
Paul hurt me so much.

470
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:58,939
It was my turn now,
by referring to what I'd seen,

471
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:01,302
without really being specific.

472
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:05,240
At heart, I was wrong.

473
00:58:05,348 --> 00:58:08,647
She wasn't unfaithful,
or she only seemed to be.

474
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:13,245
The truth remained to be proven,
despite appearances.

475
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:17,893
I've noticed that
the more we doubt,

476
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,792
the more we cling
to a false lucidity,

477
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:26,358
in the hope of rationalizing
what feelings have made murky.

478
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:30,429
I thought
Camille could leave me.

479
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,531
I thought of it as a possible disaster.

480
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:34,735
Now the disaster had happened.

481
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:39,410
We used to live
in a cloud of unawareness,

482
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:41,209
in delicious complicity.

483
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:45,212
Don't be like that.

484
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:52,160
Don't be like what?

485
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,826
You know very well.

486
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:02,397
It's your fault!

487
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:15,177
You seem to be searching
my expression to decide...

488
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:20,418
the appropriate attitude
to take with me.

489
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:29,820
"The private plane awaited
in the blue sky.

490
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:36,531
Rex remembered something
about Paula...

491
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:39,199
Her harmonious features...

492
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:45,004
Her harmonious features,
now indecisive, seemed contorted now.

493
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,614
Rex knew this trait of hers,

494
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:50,478
for it seemed that whenever Paula...

495
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:54,884
Whenever Paula had
to make a decision...

496
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:08,360
that went against her nature..."

497
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:12,605
What's got into you, Paul?

498
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:14,700
I love you exactly as before.

499
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:34,561
What would you do
if I stopped loving you?

500
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:36,825
I already told you.

501
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:39,194
I forgot what you said.

502
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:42,736
I wouldn't do the script
and we'd sell the flat.

503
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:54,012
But I love you.

504
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,548
I find this all so idiotic.

505
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:03,155
When Prokosch calls,
tell him you'll go to Capri.

506
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:18,630
What about you?

507
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:21,039
I love you.
Don't make me repeat it.

508
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:23,737
I want to keep the flat.

509
01:01:25,048 --> 01:01:27,744
If you don't want to do the script,
don't do it.

510
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:32,582
If you think I've stopped loving you,
you're wrong.

511
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:37,388
Kiss me.

512
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:09,425
We were just talking about you.

513
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:17,829
About your movie.

514
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:23,064
Yes, The Odyssey.

515
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:25,231
About that guy who travels.

516
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:28,706
In Capri,

517
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:32,346
can we go swimming?

518
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:38,446
I don't know.

519
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:46,653
Here's Paul.
I'll put him on.

520
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:18,687
We eating out?

521
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,320
I don't feel like
going down for groceries.

522
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:29,532
Fine.

523
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:32,665
We're supposed to meet
Prokosch and Lang at a movie theater.

524
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:36,007
They want to see a singer
in the stage show.

525
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:37,704
We can eat after.

526
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,941
It'll be late
if there's a movie first.

527
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:43,151
It might give me some ideas.

528
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:52,927
Why not look for ideas in your head,
instead of stealing them?

529
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:55,557
What's got into you?

530
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,390
Let's get going!

531
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,766
- I knew it.
- What?

532
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:04,806
Since I said yes to Prokosch,
so long tenderness!

533
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:08,005
Right, no more caresses.

534
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:11,543
What was the phone call about?

535
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:15,715
- Our going to Capri.
- What did you say?

536
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:18,243
That it was up to you.

537
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:21,185
Are you nuts?

538
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:25,191
You know that it's up to you,
not me!

539
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,659
Then come to Capri.

540
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:32,499
Is there something
between you and Prokosch?

541
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:35,901
You're pathetic.

542
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,814
I have to talk to you.

543
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:47,815
What, about the movies?

544
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:50,982
Listen, I have to talk to you.

545
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:56,851
All right, I'm listening.

546
01:04:58,027 --> 01:04:59,927
I have

547
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:01,929
to talk to you.

548
01:05:07,136 --> 01:05:10,537
Earlier, before the phone rang,

549
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:15,076
I said I didn't want to take this job

550
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:17,975
if I couldn't be sure of your love.

551
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:23,478
You said you loved me

552
01:05:24,453 --> 01:05:26,717
and that I should take it.

553
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,919
I'm sure you lied.

554
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:38,065
Why? I don't know.

555
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:42,298
Out of pity, self-interest...

556
01:05:42,538 --> 01:05:44,597
What self-interest?

557
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:48,699
To hold on to this flat.

558
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:52,340
How can you know what I think?

559
01:05:53,082 --> 01:05:55,573
In fact, I couldn't care less.

560
01:05:55,818 --> 01:05:58,514
Sell the flat, see if I care.

561
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:03,048
Earlier you said it was better
than a hotel.

562
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:05,156
Not at all.

563
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:07,923
I said that to make you happy.

564
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,729
That's beside the point.

565
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:15,666
I want to know why you lied.

566
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:18,300
Who said I lied? Stop it!

567
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:19,965
You did.

568
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:22,203
I can tell you've stopped loving me.

569
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:25,738
What's the use of knowing the truth?

570
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:28,175
See? You admit I'm right.

571
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:31,810
I don't admit a thing.
Leave me alone.

572
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:38,460
It's true.
I don't love you anymore.

573
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:45,528
There's nothing to explain.
I don't love you.

574
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:47,602
Why?

575
01:06:47,703 --> 01:06:49,796
Yesterday you still loved me.

576
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,365
Yes, very much.

577
01:06:55,144 --> 01:06:57,305
Now it's over.

578
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:00,812
There must be a reason.

579
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:04,183
There must be.

580
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,618
What is it?

581
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,787
I don't know.

582
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:12,884
All I know is
I don't love you anymore.

583
01:07:14,397 --> 01:07:16,763
Since we were at Prokosch's?

584
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:20,799
When you saw me pat
Francesca Vanini's behind?

585
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:27,206
Let's say it was that.

586
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:30,835
Now it's over.
Let's not talk about it.

587
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:36,050
Something happened today.

588
01:07:37,286 --> 01:07:39,652
It changed your mind about me,

589
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:42,583
hence, your love for me.

590
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,326
You're crazy, but you're smart.

591
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,559
Then it's true.

592
01:07:56,872 --> 01:07:58,499
I didn't say that.

593
01:08:00,776 --> 01:08:03,176
I said you're bright.

594
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:08,615
Was it something I said or did today
that you took the wrong way?

595
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:10,446
Maybe.

596
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:13,618
Don't talk to me that way!
I forbid you!

597
01:08:33,142 --> 01:08:34,871
I despise you!

598
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:37,036
That's really what I feel for you.

599
01:08:37,146 --> 01:08:40,047
That's why the love's gone.
I despise you.

600
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:43,015
And you disgust me
when you touch me.

601
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:58,466
You're going too far.

602
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:08,142
Forget what I said, Paul.
Act as though nothing happened.

603
01:10:49,445 --> 01:10:50,810
You okay?

604
01:12:30,879 --> 01:12:33,814
They say Ulysses came home
to Penelope,

605
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:38,150
but maybe Ulysses had been
fed up with Penelope.

606
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,647
So he went off to the Trojan war,

607
01:12:41,323 --> 01:12:43,848
and since he didn't feel
like going home,

608
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:46,655
he kept traveling
as long as he could.

609
01:12:46,762 --> 01:12:49,390
Do you think it was
an idea of his or...?

610
01:13:00,275 --> 01:13:02,505
- Why do you despise me?
- Leave me alone!

611
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:21,920
Coming to Capri with us, Mr. Lang?

612
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:26,400
"Each morning, to earn my bread

613
01:13:26,502 --> 01:13:29,733
I go to the market
where lies are sold

614
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:35,176
and, hopeful, I get in line
with the other sellers."

615
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:38,279
- What's that?
- Hollywood.

616
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:41,682
From a ballad by poor B.B.

617
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:45,177
Bertolt Brecht?

618
01:13:56,064 --> 01:13:59,158
Homer's world is a real world.

619
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:02,466
And the poet belonged to a civilization

620
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:08,198
that grew in harmony,
not in opposition,

621
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:09,868
with nature.

622
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,270
And the beauty of The Odyssey

623
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:16,111
lies precisely in this belief

624
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:19,416
in reality as it is.

625
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:22,881
Thus in reality
as it appears objectively.

626
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:24,819
Exactly,

627
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:29,159
and in a form that cannot be
broken down,

628
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:31,860
and is what it is.

629
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:34,527
Take it or leave it.

630
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:40,203
Because I have nothing to say.

631
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:58,417
I don't know if I'll go to Capri.
Where would we stay?

632
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:19,175
Wherever he likes.

633
01:15:19,448 --> 01:15:23,714
Producers are something
I can easily do without.

634
01:15:53,849 --> 01:15:56,977
Don't come if you don't want to.
I'm not forcing you.

635
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:00,951
It's not you that's forcing me.

636
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:04,021
It's life.

637
01:16:32,854 --> 01:16:34,515
What are you doing?

638
01:16:38,393 --> 01:16:39,951
What are you doing?

639
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:42,753
Looking.

640
01:16:42,864 --> 01:16:45,059
Don't stay by yourself. Join us.

641
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:48,693
What were you talking about?

642
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:50,669
The Odyssey.

643
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,870
I agree with Prokosch's theory.

644
01:16:55,177 --> 01:16:56,872
What theory's that?

645
01:16:57,312 --> 01:17:00,907
That Ulysses loves his wife,
but she doesn't love him.

646
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:05,520
You really think that?

647
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:09,113
I'm sure you don't.

648
01:17:15,497 --> 01:17:17,590
Please, you're in frame.

649
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:19,792
Places, everyone!

650
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:01,599
Will they undress?

651
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:03,109
Of course.

652
01:18:03,211 --> 01:18:05,202
Aren't movies great!

653
01:18:05,714 --> 01:18:07,682
You see women in dresses,

654
01:18:08,116 --> 01:18:10,414
in movies, you see their ass!

655
01:18:47,789 --> 01:18:49,916
Not at all.
Go on, Camille.

656
01:18:51,293 --> 01:18:52,851
Go on.

657
01:18:55,497 --> 01:18:57,522
I don't mind, go on.

658
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:04,096
I'll walk back with Mr. Lang
to discuss The Odyssey.

659
01:19:40,175 --> 01:19:42,405
The girls are in the water.

660
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:47,375
It won't take long.
First a scene in which we see

661
01:19:47,749 --> 01:19:52,550
the Council of the Gods
discussing man's fate.

662
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:36,287
Aproducer can be
a friend to a director.

663
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:41,269
But Prokosch isn't a real producer.
He's a dictator.

664
01:20:42,704 --> 01:20:47,403
I think it's stupid to change
the character of Ulysses.

665
01:20:48,143 --> 01:20:51,943
He's not a modern-day neurotic,

666
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:56,950
but a simple, clever
and robust man.

667
01:20:57,886 --> 01:21:00,047
I find the idea interesting.

668
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:03,616
It takes Ulysses
1 0 years to return home

669
01:21:03,959 --> 01:21:06,928
because he doesn't want to.
It's logical.

670
01:21:08,129 --> 01:21:09,926
It's logical,

671
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:13,558
and the illogical
borrows from the logical.

672
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:18,304
Your Corneille said it
in his preface to Surena.

673
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:23,333
Ulysses doesn't rush home to Ithaca

674
01:21:23,445 --> 01:21:26,505
because he was unhappy with Penelope,

675
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:32,186
even before he went off.

676
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:41,385
Had he been happy,
he'd have stayed home.

677
01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:45,657
He used the Trojan war
to get away from his wife.

678
01:21:46,301 --> 01:21:49,668
He killed her suitors, didn't he?

679
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:52,363
That can be justified...

680
01:21:52,474 --> 01:21:55,637
by the fact that
Ulysses had told Penelope

681
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:58,235
to give in and accept the gifts.

682
01:21:59,447 --> 01:22:02,507
He didn't see the suitors
as serious threats.

683
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:06,185
He didn't throw them out,
to avoid a scandal.

684
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:09,787
Knowing Penelope to be faithful,

685
01:22:10,558 --> 01:22:13,584
he told her to be nice
to the suitors.

686
01:22:20,368 --> 01:22:22,632
I think that's when Penelope,

687
01:22:22,737 --> 01:22:27,106
who at heart is a simple woman,

688
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:30,711
began to despise him.

689
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:35,549
She stopped loving Ulysses
because of his conduct

690
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:38,848
and she told him so.

691
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:43,715
Ulysses then realized too late
he'd lost Penelope's love

692
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:47,691
because he'd been overly cautious.

693
01:22:49,064 --> 01:22:51,294
The only way to win her back

694
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:54,435
was to murder the suitors.

695
01:22:54,536 --> 01:22:57,164
Death is no resolution.

696
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:50,671
I found this on the boat.

697
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:54,911
Children mustn't play with firearms.

698
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:47,632
I was there, outside.

699
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:50,166
Nothing.

700
01:27:46,294 --> 01:27:48,524
I'm a playwright.

701
01:27:49,831 --> 01:27:51,822
I'm not a screenwriter.

702
01:27:57,138 --> 01:28:00,107
Even if it's a fine script...
I'm being frank,

703
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:02,438
I'd do it only for the money!

704
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:11,210
That's why I'm in a bad mood.

705
01:28:15,657 --> 01:28:19,423
We all have an ideal.
Mine's writing plays. I can't. Why?

706
01:28:22,664 --> 01:28:26,828
In today's world,
we have to accept what others want.

707
01:28:30,204 --> 01:28:33,002
Why does money matter so much
in what we do,

708
01:28:33,274 --> 01:28:35,708
in what we are,
in what we become?

709
01:28:37,945 --> 01:28:40,743
Even in our relationships
with those we love.

710
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:08,772
Mr. Prokosch already said it:
You're wrong.

711
01:29:08,876 --> 01:29:12,107
You aspire to a world like Homer's.

712
01:29:12,413 --> 01:29:15,849
You want it to exist,
but unfortunately it doesn't.

713
01:29:15,983 --> 01:29:17,644
Why not? It does!

714
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:28,295
You may be right,

715
01:29:28,396 --> 01:29:32,856
but when it comes to making movies,
dreams aren't enough.

716
01:29:41,909 --> 01:29:44,207
When do we eat?

717
01:29:47,915 --> 01:29:49,576
In an hour.

718
01:29:50,952 --> 01:29:52,886
I'm going for a walk.

719
01:30:01,596 --> 01:30:03,689
Mr. Prokosch wants to speak with you.

720
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:12,972
Is that an order or a request?

721
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:14,769
A request.

722
01:30:21,682 --> 01:30:23,377
One must suffer.

723
01:30:26,521 --> 01:30:28,216
That's for sure.

724
01:31:29,450 --> 01:31:31,008
It's me, Paul.

725
01:31:38,259 --> 01:31:41,888
I've been watching you as if
I were seeing you for the first time.

726
01:31:55,309 --> 01:31:57,277
Mind if I stay?

727
01:31:58,412 --> 01:32:00,243
Stay if you like.

728
01:32:20,301 --> 01:32:22,496
Why didn't you speak up earlier?

729
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:27,474
I don't get you!
You always said you loved that script.

730
01:32:28,009 --> 01:32:31,240
Now you tell the producer
it's for the money,

731
01:32:31,345 --> 01:32:33,575
that your ideal's the theater.

732
01:32:35,516 --> 01:32:39,885
He's no fool. Next time,
he'll think twice before asking you.

733
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:42,985
How can you not understand
something so simple?

734
01:32:46,994 --> 01:32:49,189
I bet you'll do it anyway.

735
01:32:51,732 --> 01:32:54,223
You'll see.

736
01:32:55,136 --> 01:32:56,967
I know you.

737
01:32:58,873 --> 01:33:00,807
I know you.

738
01:33:01,709 --> 01:33:05,304
If I do, it'll be for you.
To pay for the flat.

739
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:09,681
I'll let you decide
whether I do the script or not.

740
01:33:10,284 --> 01:33:13,685
If you say no, we'll leave.

741
01:33:14,055 --> 01:33:15,818
Very clever!

742
01:33:15,923 --> 01:33:18,221
Not at all. Why?

743
01:33:18,526 --> 01:33:21,427
If you regret it later,
you can blame it on me.

744
01:33:21,529 --> 01:33:24,293
Not at all!
I'm asking you to decide.

745
01:33:24,398 --> 01:33:26,923
You really want me
to tell you what to do?

746
01:33:27,034 --> 01:33:28,558
Yes.

747
01:33:28,669 --> 01:33:30,694
Then do the script!

748
01:33:30,805 --> 01:33:32,932
You signed a contract
and you bore me.

749
01:33:37,278 --> 01:33:39,746
I saw him kiss you earlier.

750
01:33:39,847 --> 01:33:41,337
I know you did.

751
01:33:45,353 --> 01:33:47,321
Why don't you love me anymore?

752
01:33:48,522 --> 01:33:49,921
That's life.

753
01:33:51,525 --> 01:33:53,356
Why do you despise me?

754
01:33:55,196 --> 01:33:58,427
I'll never tell you,
even if I were dying.

755
01:34:04,238 --> 01:34:07,867
- Tell me or I'll hurt you.
- Why hurt me on top of it?

756
01:34:12,413 --> 01:34:14,745
I have to know why you despise me.

757
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:19,381
This is crazy!
How can you expect me to accept it?

758
01:34:21,255 --> 01:34:23,780
We need the money
to pay for the flat.

759
01:34:23,891 --> 01:34:25,654
I quit my typing job.

760
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,819
I can't accept that
after what happened.

761
01:34:28,829 --> 01:34:30,820
So, of course, you despise me.

762
01:34:48,149 --> 01:34:52,449
You see us kiss but you're ready
to change your mind anyway.

763
01:34:52,553 --> 01:34:56,956
I turned the job down for you.
So you'd change your mind about me.

764
01:34:58,693 --> 01:35:01,719
Don't touch me.
I don't love you anymore.

765
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:06,022
There's no way
I'll ever love you again.

766
01:35:07,735 --> 01:35:10,397
Even if I turn it down,
you'll despise me?

767
01:35:11,238 --> 01:35:13,706
- Yes, I will.
- Why?

768
01:35:14,408 --> 01:35:16,808
Tell me why!
There must be a reason.

769
01:35:17,111 --> 01:35:19,306
You're the reason.

770
01:35:19,413 --> 01:35:21,278
What do you mean, me?

771
01:35:23,017 --> 01:35:26,009
I don't know.
You're not a man.

772
01:35:27,388 --> 01:35:29,515
Anyhow, it's too late.

773
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:32,916
I've changed my mind about you.

774
01:35:34,295 --> 01:35:36,695
I know why you despise me.

775
01:35:37,798 --> 01:35:39,823
When I took the taxi the other day,

776
01:35:39,934 --> 01:35:42,835
you thought I let you go
with him on purpose.

777
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:49,876
Same thing on the boat earlier.
Don't be stupid!

778
01:35:50,111 --> 01:35:52,477
I have faults, but that's not one.

779
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:54,571
I'll never forgive you.

780
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:58,578
I loved you so much.

781
01:36:00,921 --> 01:36:02,752
Now it's impossible.

782
01:36:04,258 --> 01:36:07,421
I hate you because
you're incapable of moving me.

783
01:36:07,962 --> 01:36:09,691
I can!
You're on the verge of tears.

784
01:36:23,410 --> 01:36:26,208
We're leaving!
We'll pack up and go.

785
01:36:27,114 --> 01:36:30,311
I'm staying. Go if you like.

786
01:36:31,752 --> 01:36:33,481
Come on, Camille!

787
01:36:37,858 --> 01:36:39,621
Then I'm staying, too.

788
01:36:39,927 --> 01:36:42,487
But Prokosch will throw us out.

789
01:36:42,596 --> 01:36:44,826
- Don't start!
- I will!

790
01:37:27,041 --> 01:37:28,531
Dear Paul,

791
01:37:28,642 --> 01:37:31,770
I found your revolver
and took the bullets out.

792
01:37:31,979 --> 01:37:35,278
If you won't leave, I will.

793
01:37:35,683 --> 01:37:38,948
Since Prokosch has to return to Rome,

794
01:37:39,053 --> 01:37:40,987
I'm going with him.

795
01:37:41,288 --> 01:37:44,849
Then I'll probably move
into a hotel alone.

796
01:37:45,526 --> 01:37:47,824
Take care. Farewell.

797
01:37:48,128 --> 01:37:50,255
Camille.

798
01:38:33,974 --> 01:38:35,805
Typist.

799
01:38:41,882 --> 01:38:43,349
Me?

800
01:38:45,386 --> 01:38:47,217
Typist.

801
01:39:12,246 --> 01:39:15,238
What do you think...

802
01:39:16,150 --> 01:39:17,913
of me?

803
01:39:18,552 --> 01:39:22,886
Get into your Alfa, Romeo.
We'll see about that later.

804
01:39:22,990 --> 01:39:25,481
TAKE CARE

805
01:39:34,535 --> 01:39:37,868
FAREWELL

806
01:40:40,868 --> 01:40:42,460
Good-bye, then.

807
01:41:25,245 --> 01:41:28,078
Mr. Lang, I've come to say good-bye.

808
01:41:29,817 --> 01:41:32,650
Good-bye. What will you do?

809
01:41:33,353 --> 01:41:36,880
Go back to Rome, finish my play.

810
01:41:39,126 --> 01:41:40,423
And you?

811
01:41:40,527 --> 01:41:44,395
I'll finish the film.
Always finish what you start.

812
01:41:46,567 --> 01:41:48,558
What shot are you doing?

813
01:41:49,603 --> 01:41:53,095
Ulysses' gaze when he first sees
his homeland again.

814
01:41:56,009 --> 01:41:57,704
Ithaca.

815
01:41:58,979 --> 01:42:01,243
Good-bye, Mr. Lang.

816
01:42:01,648 --> 01:42:03,775
