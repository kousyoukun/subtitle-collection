16
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:11,291
André Bazin said: "Cinema shows us
a world that fits our desires."

17
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:17,125
Contempt is the story of that world.

18
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,375
I don't know.

19
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:39,375
Maybe I'll go to Mum's.
I don't know what I'll do afterwards.

20
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:48,000
Come pick me up if you want.
At 4 o'clock. At Cinecittà.

21
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:53,916
I have to talk to that American.

22
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,458
Maybe I will.

23
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:06,625
- See my feet in the mirror?
- Yes.

24
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:12,500
- Think they're pretty?
- Very.

25
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:20,083
- You like my ankles?
- Yes.

26
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:25,750
And my knees, too?

27
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:30,250
Yes. I really like your knees.

28
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:36,000
And my thighs?

29
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:39,916
And your thighs.

30
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:48,125
Do you see my bottom in the mirror?

31
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:52,083
Yes.

32
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:57,750
Do you think I have nice buttocks?

33
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:01,583
Yes. Very.

34
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:08,375
- Shall I get on my knees?
- No.

35
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:16,125
- No need to.
- And my breasts. You like them?

36
00:04:16,292 --> 00:04:23,416
- Yes, tremendously.
- Gently, Paul. Not so hard.

37
00:04:25,876 --> 00:04:27,958
Sorry.

38
00:04:29,084 --> 00:04:35,416
Which do you like better,
my breasts or my nipples?

39
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,625
I don't know. Both equally.

40
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:50,666
- And do you like my shoulders?
- Yes.

41
00:04:51,501 --> 00:04:57,125
- I don't think they're round enough.
- I do.

42
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:02,375
And my arms?

43
00:05:10,251 --> 00:05:12,833
And my face?

44
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:18,583
- And your face.
- All of it?

45
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:23,250
My mouth, my eyes,
my nose, my ears?

46
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:29,875
- Yes, everything.
- Then you love me totally.

47
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:36,958
I love you totally,
tenderly, tragically.

48
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:41,458
So do I, Paul.

49
00:05:44,876 --> 00:05:50,333
Hi. How are you?
What's going on? The place is empty!

50
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:55,041
Jerry fired nearly everybody.
Italian cinema is in trouble.

51
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:59,958
- Where is he?
- Over there.

52
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:42,625
Only yesterday
there were kings here.

53
00:06:48,626 --> 00:06:51,041
Princesses, lovers...

54
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:57,458
All human emotions.

55
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:06,625
Yesterday he sold everything.

56
00:07:10,126 --> 00:07:13,458
They're going to build
a supermarket.

57
00:07:15,584 --> 00:07:21,000
- It's the end of cinema.
- I don't think cinema will ever die.

58
00:07:27,001 --> 00:07:32,041
He says you wrote Toto against
Hercules. It's doing well in New York.

59
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:34,916
Not bad.

60
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:45,208
Don't be modest,
You need pride to make good films.

61
00:07:45,376 --> 00:07:50,041
- Do you know The Odyssey?
- Your film with Fritz Lang?

62
00:07:54,084 --> 00:07:58,666
- It's not working out.
- Why did you hire Lang?

63
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:10,583
The Odyssey needs a German director
because a German discovered Troy.

64
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:15,083
What should I do?

65
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:34,291
He needs new scenes for The Odyssey,
not only more sex, but more...

66
00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:37,916
Like all producers,
he doesn't know.

67
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:54,166
To know that one doesn't know
is the gift of a superior spirit.

68
00:08:57,042 --> 00:09:00,916
Not to know and think that one knows
is a mistake.

69
00:09:05,001 --> 00:09:09,000
To know it is a mistake
keeps one from making it.

70
00:09:11,126 --> 00:09:13,708
I don't think Lang will accept.

71
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:24,166
In '33, Goebbels asked Lang to head the
German film industry. Lang left Germany.

72
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:41,458
This is not '33 and Mr. Prokosch
knows you'll do the job.

73
00:09:41,626 --> 00:09:44,125
Why?

74
00:09:47,376 --> 00:09:53,250
He'll tell you during the projection.
This way.

75
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:28,708
So... Why?

76
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:37,875
- Because you need money.
- How does he know?

77
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:50,291
He was told you have
a very beautiful wife.

78
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:10,916
Each film should have
a definite point of view.

79
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:22,041
It's the eternal problem
of the ancient Greeks.

80
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:36,750
It's a fight against the gods.
The fight of Ulysses.

81
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:34,833
This is Minerva, isn't it?

82
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:39,083
She's Ulysses' protector.

83
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:46,083
And that's Neptune,
his mortal enemy.

84
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:32,333
Mr. Prokosch likes gods.

85
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:37,916
He knows how they feel.

86
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:55,333
Look, that's Homer.

87
00:13:55,501 --> 00:14:01,041
The gods did not create man,
man created gods.

88
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:14,500
It's a mermaid.

89
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:28,833
That's art,
but will the public understand?

90
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:42,583
- Who's that?
- Penelope.

91
00:14:50,084 --> 00:14:53,291
Mr. Prokosch has a theory
about The Odyssey.

92
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:57,500
He thinks Ulysses' wife
was unfaithful.

93
00:15:14,876 --> 00:15:20,458
O my brothers, who braved
100,000 perils to reach the West,

94
00:15:20,626 --> 00:15:26,500
don't refuse to know, by following
the sun, the uninhabited world.

95
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:33,041
"Consider your origin.
You were not born to live as brutes,

96
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:36,666
but to pursue virtue and knowledge."

97
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:43,375
- Have you heard that before?
- Yes, it's very famous. Dante.

98
00:15:45,501 --> 00:15:48,875
"Night then looked all the stars.

99
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:02,666
Our joy soon turned to tears

100
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:08,750
until the sea closed in on us."

101
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:17,333
- I'm Paul Javal. Mr. Prokosch...
- I know.

102
00:17:17,501 --> 00:17:20,625
It looks swell.
I really like Cinemascope.

103
00:17:20,792 --> 00:17:26,250
It wasn't made for people
but for snakes and funerals.

104
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:54,291
What's the matter, Miss Vanini?
ls it about the script?

105
00:18:24,459 --> 00:18:28,791
He says it's not the same
on screen as on paper.

106
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:45,416
I'll just see if my wife's arrived.

107
00:19:00,459 --> 00:19:06,708
...The Nazis used to say "revolver"
instead of "cheque book".

108
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:27,541
Are you going to accept the job?
Yes or no?

109
00:20:03,126 --> 00:20:08,875
"But Man, when he must, can stand
fearless and alone before God.

110
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:14,375
His candour is his shield.
He needs neither arms nor wiles

111
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:18,625
until such time
as God's absence helps him."

112
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:23,708
- That's Hölderlin, isn't it?
- Yes. The Poet's Vocation.

113
00:20:25,084 --> 00:20:29,333
The final line is obscure.
Hölderlin originally wrote...

114
00:20:33,042 --> 00:20:38,500
- "So long as God is not present."
- And then...

115
00:20:41,584 --> 00:20:44,625
"So long as God is close to us."

116
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:51,500
The way the last lines are written,
when you've read the other two,

117
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:55,791
is no longer about God's presence.

118
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:59,250
It's God's absence
that reassures Man.

119
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:03,000
Strange, but true.

120
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:09,500
How do you say "strange" in Italian?

121
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:26,416
I'll be back in five minutes.

122
00:22:01,626 --> 00:22:05,458
Meet Mr. Prokosch.
Camille, my wife.

123
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:16,708
- My wife, Camille.
- How do you do?

124
00:22:16,876 --> 00:22:19,666
- Fritz Lang.
- Hello.

125
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:22,958
He's the one who did
that western with Dietrich.

126
00:22:23,126 --> 00:22:27,333
- It was terrific!
- I prefer M.

127
00:22:27,501 --> 00:22:30,791
We just saw it on TV.
I really liked it.

128
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:33,791
Thank you. That's kind of you.

129
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:39,125
I love the scene
when Ferrer leans on the scales.

130
00:22:39,292 --> 00:22:42,875
Thank you.
When I finish The Odyssey...

131
00:22:46,584 --> 00:22:50,916
Mr. Prokosch is inviting you
for a drink.

132
00:22:51,084 --> 00:22:52,916
I don't know.

133
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:01,208
- He says you know perfectly.
- Me?

134
00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:07,500
Yes, I could have a drink.

135
00:23:13,584 --> 00:23:16,458
Goodbye, I'll phone you.
Madam.

136
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:25,916
We'll go if you want.

137
00:23:29,084 --> 00:23:32,333
Sit down, madam.

138
00:23:33,834 --> 00:23:38,000
- You won't be comfortable...
- I'll meet you there.

139
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:42,000
- Mr. Prokosch will come back for you.
- No, I'll grab a taxi.

140
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:45,333
Let him go on ahead.
We can both take a cab.

141
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:47,583
Make up your mind.

142
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:51,625
Come on, you go.

143
00:24:33,292 --> 00:24:35,500
What's the address?

144
00:25:45,584 --> 00:25:50,541
- What did he say?
- My English is as bad as yours.

145
00:25:55,001 --> 00:25:59,750
We've been waiting half an hour.
What kept you?

146
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:13,416
Nothing. I had an accident...

147
00:26:13,584 --> 00:26:19,125
I was in the cab,
and at the corner of the street...

148
00:26:19,292 --> 00:26:25,291
Two cars, you know...
The whole bumper was hanging off.

149
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:29,833
Then the two drivers
started shouting at each other.

150
00:26:32,251 --> 00:26:37,250
- I needed another cab. That's why...
- That's why, what?

151
00:26:39,626 --> 00:26:45,333
What? Why I'm late.
I had to walk God knows how long...

152
00:26:45,501 --> 00:26:49,833
From Saint-Ange to Piazza Venezia
to find a cab.

153
00:26:54,084 --> 00:26:56,958
Yeah, it took ages.

154
00:27:03,792 --> 00:27:08,625
Anyway, I don't give a damn.
I'm not interested in your story.

155
00:27:12,876 --> 00:27:15,666
It took me 20 minutes.

156
00:27:19,084 --> 00:27:22,375
- You don't believe me.
- We'll discuss it later.

157
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,875
I'm going for a walk.

158
00:28:06,126 --> 00:28:10,666
- Come tomorrow to sign the contract.
- All right.

159
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:16,333
Camille, why are you so quiet?

160
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:06,416
Friday we shoot in Capri.
Come with us.

161
00:29:06,584 --> 00:29:11,375
Answer her.
Why don't you speak?

162
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:18,333
- What were you doing before I arrived?
- Nothing special.

163
00:29:18,501 --> 00:29:21,625
Why? Did he come on to you?

164
00:29:23,126 --> 00:29:26,958
- Why ask me that?
- Just because.

165
00:29:33,584 --> 00:29:36,208
I should wash my hands.

166
00:29:43,584 --> 00:29:47,541
- Where can I wash?
- Upstairs, on the right.

167
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:58,958
- What's the matter? You look down.
- Nothing.

168
00:30:01,376 --> 00:30:05,166
Have you been crying?

169
00:30:06,376 --> 00:30:11,000
- Your boss is a hard man.
- He is.

170
00:30:13,834 --> 00:30:16,958
Known him long?

171
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:26,833
- What did he do before movies?
- I don't want to talk about it.

172
00:30:27,001 --> 00:30:30,958
I was just asking.

173
00:30:31,126 --> 00:30:34,750
It's stupid to be so sweet
and so sad.

174
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:38,875
Haven't you anything
more amusing to say?

175
00:30:39,042 --> 00:30:41,958
More amusing?

176
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:46,041
A funny story.

177
00:30:47,334 --> 00:30:50,458
Which one shall I tell?

178
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:56,958
I know, the one about
Sri Ramakrishna and his disciple.

179
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:06,833
Ramakrishna was a Hindu sage.

180
00:31:07,001 --> 00:31:12,916
He had this disciple who didn't believe
in his master's teachings anymore.

181
00:31:14,126 --> 00:31:19,166
He decided to study on his own.
So he went away.

182
00:31:19,334 --> 00:31:23,708
After 15 years, he came back
and said: "I've found it!"

183
00:31:23,876 --> 00:31:26,333
Found what?

184
00:31:26,501 --> 00:31:32,000
He tells the sage: "I'll show you"
and takes him to the riverbank.

185
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:36,958
The disciple crosses back and forth
walking on the water.

186
00:31:37,126 --> 00:31:42,750
And he says: "You see? I can cross
without getting wet, now I know."

187
00:31:44,834 --> 00:31:47,541
So Ramakrishna replies:

188
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:52,625
"You fool! I did that 10 years ago
with a rupee and a rowboat!"

189
00:31:57,834 --> 00:32:01,958
Feeling better now?
That's good.

190
00:32:03,709 --> 00:32:06,833
- Paul.
- What?

191
00:32:09,001 --> 00:32:13,500
- Call that washing your hands?
- As you can see.

192
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:18,583
- I was just telling her the joke...
- I believe you already.

193
00:32:18,751 --> 00:32:21,583
You're being an idiot.

194
00:32:21,751 --> 00:32:25,708
- Where can I pee?
- Up there.

195
00:32:35,417 --> 00:32:39,791
It's a book about Roman paintings,
it will help you.

196
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:42,458
The Odyssey is in Greek.

197
00:32:50,834 --> 00:32:53,541
He knows.

198
00:33:12,001 --> 00:33:15,041
What? About what?

199
00:33:28,376 --> 00:33:31,500
About the money and your wife.

200
00:33:45,251 --> 00:33:48,375
Mr. Prokosch is inviting you
for dinner.

201
00:33:48,542 --> 00:33:51,375
I'm tired, I'd rather leave.

202
00:33:54,001 --> 00:33:56,666
Tell them we're leaving.

203
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:02,625
We're leaving then.

204
00:34:07,709 --> 00:34:10,500
If you decide about Capri,
call tonight.

205
00:34:10,667 --> 00:34:16,083
- We must get the villa ready.
- Paul will call you.

206
00:34:18,126 --> 00:34:21,291
Why don't you come?

207
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:24,250
It's my husband who decides.

208
00:34:32,251 --> 00:34:35,125
What interests you about The Odyssey?

209
00:34:35,292 --> 00:34:39,041
I don't know yet.

210
00:34:39,209 --> 00:34:43,375
Maybe because it's the opposite
of today's films which I hate.

211
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:49,208
I'd like to return to Griffith
and Chaplin.

212
00:34:50,917 --> 00:34:53,875
Like in the days of United Artists.

213
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:05,208
The wise man does not oppress others
with his superiority.

214
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:13,083
He doesn't humiliate them
for their impotence.

215
00:35:31,376 --> 00:35:36,958
He's crazy!
Did you see? He kicked me!

216
00:35:37,126 --> 00:35:42,791
You change your mind fast.
Monday you thought he was terrific.

217
00:35:50,251 --> 00:35:55,750
Now I think he's a jerk.
I have a right to change my mind.

218
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:04,708
What happened in the past hour?

219
00:36:04,876 --> 00:36:08,416
Nothing. if you're happy, so am I.

220
00:36:34,376 --> 00:36:37,666
Rio Bravo is playing in town.

221
00:36:40,251 --> 00:36:43,291
So is Nicholas Ray's Bigger Than Life.

222
00:36:43,459 --> 00:36:46,875
I'm not interested.

223
00:36:47,042 --> 00:36:50,541
- I wrote it.
- I know.

224
00:36:52,334 --> 00:36:55,875
I phoned your mum's at lunchtime.
There was no answer.

225
00:36:56,042 --> 00:37:00,375
We ate here.
I didn't feel like going out.

226
00:37:05,084 --> 00:37:09,125
I like living here.
It's better than a hotel.

227
00:37:09,292 --> 00:37:12,000
See? I was right.

228
00:37:13,792 --> 00:37:16,458
What are they paying
for the script?

229
00:37:16,626 --> 00:37:20,166
10,000 dollars. Six million lire.

230
00:37:20,334 --> 00:37:24,708
We can finish paying off the flat.
Isn't that great?

231
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:27,541
Yes, it's great.

232
00:37:38,084 --> 00:37:43,208
When will you call your friend
about the curtains? It's annoying me.

233
00:37:43,376 --> 00:37:45,916
Once he's back from Spain.

234
00:37:46,084 --> 00:37:48,791
Roberto said he'd be back on Friday.

235
00:37:54,042 --> 00:37:57,708
Red velvet. It's that or nothing.

236
00:37:57,876 --> 00:38:00,291
Okay.

237
00:38:00,459 --> 00:38:06,625
- Set the table while I take a bath?
- I wanted to take a bath, too.

238
00:38:06,792 --> 00:38:09,833
You go first. I can do some work.

239
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:16,000
No, I'll go later, while it's cooking.

240
00:38:17,126 --> 00:38:21,375
You're cooking fagiolini again?

241
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:25,125
Yes, whether you like it or not.

242
00:38:25,292 --> 00:38:29,625
- I can set the table.
- I was just doing it.

243
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:14,583
I bought myself something today.
Tell me what you think.

244
00:39:14,751 --> 00:39:17,416
What did you buy?

245
00:39:23,251 --> 00:39:24,791
What?

246
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:29,083
- Don't look yet.
- You want to go to Capri?

247
00:39:37,251 --> 00:39:41,916
- What?
- You want us to go to Capri?

248
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:48,375
I won't say no,
but I won't say yes either.

249
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:50,791
It would be like a holiday.

250
00:39:53,084 --> 00:39:57,208
- Anyway, he didn't invite me.
- What?

251
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:03,375
He invited you, not me.

252
00:40:11,001 --> 00:40:14,125
Where did we put the mirror?

253
00:40:32,001 --> 00:40:35,208
Not at all. We were both invited.

254
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:39,583
Look.

255
00:40:42,751 --> 00:40:46,916
- Doesn't it suit me?
- No, I prefer you as a blonde.

256
00:40:47,084 --> 00:40:51,041
And I prefer you
without a hat and cigar.

257
00:40:51,209 --> 00:40:55,625
It's just to look like Dean Martin
in Some Came Running.

258
00:40:55,792 --> 00:41:00,916
- What a laugh!
- What is?

259
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:03,750
You may want to look
like Dean Martin,

260
00:41:03,917 --> 00:41:08,375
but it's more like Martin's ass.
- Who's that?

261
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:13,333
Never read the adventures
of Martin's ass?

262
00:41:13,501 --> 00:41:18,083
One day he goes to Baghdad
to buy a flying carpet.

263
00:41:18,251 --> 00:41:21,291
He finds this really nice one,

264
00:41:21,459 --> 00:41:24,625
so he sits on it,
but it doesn't take off.

265
00:41:24,792 --> 00:41:27,750
"Hardly surprising,"
says the carpet seller...

266
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:31,125
- Are you listening?
- Yes.

267
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:36,416
"The carpet won't take off
if you think about an ass."

268
00:41:36,584 --> 00:41:40,125
So Martin says:
"Okay, I won't think of an ass."

269
00:41:40,292 --> 00:41:45,083
But automatically he thinks of one,
so the carpet doesn't fly.

270
00:41:45,251 --> 00:41:49,083
What's that got to do with me?

271
00:41:49,251 --> 00:41:53,333
- That's my point exactly.
- Well, I don't get it.

272
00:41:58,376 --> 00:42:01,875
Never mind.
Are you finished?

273
00:42:02,042 --> 00:42:06,791
No need to change the water.
I didn't use soap.

274
00:42:14,084 --> 00:42:18,000
You've been acting weird.
What's wrong?

275
00:42:18,167 --> 00:42:23,291
Nothing. I knew you'd say that.

276
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:28,041
Is it about that girl?

277
00:42:28,209 --> 00:42:33,500
It's nothing, I tell you.
I simply said you were an ass.

278
00:42:39,376 --> 00:42:42,208
Not the same sound all over.

279
00:42:44,459 --> 00:42:48,083
Why don't you want us
to go to Capri?

280
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:52,583
Because you're an ass.

281
00:42:59,959 --> 00:43:02,458
You scare me, Paul.

282
00:43:03,876 --> 00:43:06,500
And it's not the first time.

283
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:10,000
So answer
instead of just standing there.

284
00:43:10,167 --> 00:43:14,791
Why did I marry a 28-year-old typist?

285
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:18,375
It's true. I'm sorry.

286
00:43:22,376 --> 00:43:25,208
So am I.

287
00:43:36,959 --> 00:43:42,041
You go to Capri if you want.
I don't feel like it.

288
00:43:42,209 --> 00:43:47,625
Besides, I don't like
that Jeremy Prokosch. I told you.

289
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:50,916
Why? Did he do something to you?

290
00:43:52,459 --> 00:43:55,458
Absolutely not.

291
00:44:08,584 --> 00:44:11,541
Why so thoughtful?

292
00:44:12,584 --> 00:44:16,666
Because I'm thinking,
believe it or not.

293
00:44:17,876 --> 00:44:21,625
- Surprised?
- No. Why?

294
00:44:23,126 --> 00:44:27,250
- An idea.
- Come with me. I won't go alone.

295
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:31,583
You've been acting funny
since we met that guy.

296
00:44:34,876 --> 00:44:37,458
I'm not funny.

297
00:44:42,459 --> 00:44:46,833
- Why would you say that?
- Just because.

298
00:44:47,001 --> 00:44:52,916
We were fine this morning.
Now we're fighting over nothing.

299
00:44:53,084 --> 00:44:56,958
- What's going on, baby?
- I want to have fun.

300
00:44:57,126 --> 00:44:59,958
Nothing's going on, Paul.

301
00:45:00,126 --> 00:45:03,833
I'm afraid I'll get bored there.

302
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:08,291
I'm not going.

303
00:45:25,917 --> 00:45:29,958
Seen the house being built
across the way?

304
00:45:31,459 --> 00:45:34,375
It's awful.

305
00:45:34,542 --> 00:45:38,000
If you love me, just be quiet.

306
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:50,750
A husband has a right to know
why his wife's sulking.

307
00:45:52,584 --> 00:45:57,125
- I'm sure it's about that girl.
- Drop dead!

308
00:46:15,251 --> 00:46:18,416
Hello. Good afternoon.

309
00:46:19,417 --> 00:46:22,583
No, Camille isn't here.

310
00:46:23,709 --> 00:46:27,708
I thought you ate in town
and went shopping.

311
00:46:29,584 --> 00:46:34,541
She just walked in the door!
Your mother.

312
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:20,958
I'll call you tomorrow. Ciao.

313
00:47:21,126 --> 00:47:27,500
You're out of your mind!
Why did you tell her I was out?

314
00:47:27,667 --> 00:47:31,458
- I don't know why.
- I know why.

315
00:47:31,626 --> 00:47:38,125
To find out if she had lunch with me
and if I wasn't lying.

316
00:47:38,292 --> 00:47:43,166
- That's it.
- Try that again and I'll divorce you.

317
00:47:44,834 --> 00:47:50,041
- Get up!
- What are you doing?

318
00:47:50,209 --> 00:47:52,958
I'm sleeping on the couch.

319
00:47:53,126 --> 00:47:59,291
- When, tonight?
- Every night, starting tonight.

320
00:48:09,251 --> 00:48:15,416
Don't be angry. I just can't sleep
with the window open.

321
00:48:15,584 --> 00:48:18,375
We'll close the window.

322
00:48:18,542 --> 00:48:22,625
You always say you can't breathe.
No, we'll sleep apart.

323
00:48:22,792 --> 00:48:27,916
Thousands of couples do it.
They still get along fine.

324
00:48:28,084 --> 00:48:31,458
What did I do wrong? Tell me.

325
00:48:33,459 --> 00:48:37,416
I'm sorry I said you were out.
ls that it? Forgive me.

326
00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:40,958
Let me by.

327
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:45,875
- Is that why you're in a bad mood?
- Yes, but not anymore.

328
00:48:48,751 --> 00:48:52,375
I'll be just fine here.

329
00:48:52,542 --> 00:48:55,708
I really wonder what I did.

330
00:49:01,626 --> 00:49:04,583
You're so mean all of a sudden.

331
00:49:04,751 --> 00:49:08,375
Me? I'm the same as always.

332
00:49:10,459 --> 00:49:13,583
You're the one who's changed.

333
00:49:18,834 --> 00:49:23,416
Ever since you've been
with movie people.

334
00:49:23,584 --> 00:49:26,625
You used to write crime novels.

335
00:49:26,792 --> 00:49:32,250
We didn't have much money,
but everything was fine.

336
00:49:39,834 --> 00:49:46,000
What's this?
"Partito Comunista Italiano".

337
00:49:46,167 --> 00:49:50,583
- You never said you joined.
- That was two months ago in Paris.

338
00:49:50,751 --> 00:49:56,875
- Give me that.
- Let go! You'll bruise me.

339
00:49:57,042 --> 00:50:00,750
I'm working for you.
This place is not just for me!

340
00:50:00,917 --> 00:50:05,958
Please, Paul,
I don't want to argue.

341
00:50:14,959 --> 00:50:18,041
I don't want to go to Capri, either.

342
00:50:18,209 --> 00:50:21,458
Why not? Don't be stupid. Go.

343
00:50:27,959 --> 00:50:31,250
Paul, come here.

344
00:50:31,417 --> 00:50:33,958
What?

345
00:50:34,126 --> 00:50:36,708
No, I've lost interest.

346
00:50:36,876 --> 00:50:40,916
When Prokosch calls,
tell him I won't talk to him.

347
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:45,083
Paul, come here.

348
00:50:48,459 --> 00:50:51,625
Why won't you do the script now?

349
00:50:54,459 --> 00:50:57,583
I'd have done it out of love for you.

350
00:50:59,959 --> 00:51:03,625
But you don't love me anymore.

351
00:51:03,792 --> 00:51:06,583
That's news!

352
00:51:11,667 --> 00:51:16,000
"I had to judge a bottom contest
between three beautiful women.

353
00:51:16,167 --> 00:51:18,958
They chose me as a judge.

354
00:51:19,126 --> 00:51:22,416
They showed me
their dazzling nudity.

355
00:51:22,584 --> 00:51:27,416
The first had a white and gentle
curved back with round dimples.

356
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:32,916
When the second parted her legs,
her snowy skin grew as red as a rose.

357
00:51:33,084 --> 00:51:36,375
The third was as still as a quiet sea.

358
00:51:36,542 --> 00:51:42,375
Her delicate skin rippled gently,
shivering involuntarily."

359
00:51:46,459 --> 00:51:52,083
We'll just mortgage the flat
when we run out of money.

360
00:51:52,251 --> 00:51:56,958
Something makes you think
I've stopped loving you?

361
00:51:57,126 --> 00:52:00,416
Yes.

362
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:04,291
What?

363
00:52:06,292 --> 00:52:08,041
Everything.

364
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:11,333
But what, for instance?

365
00:52:15,626 --> 00:52:20,875
- First tell me if it's true.
- No, you tell me first.

366
00:52:22,209 --> 00:52:25,541
What makes me think
you've stopped loving me?

367
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:28,708
The way you've been talking to me.

368
00:52:29,584 --> 00:52:33,125
You weren't like that this morning.

369
00:52:38,001 --> 00:52:40,666
Nor yesterday.

370
00:52:43,001 --> 00:52:46,958
It's the way you look at me, too.

371
00:52:53,709 --> 00:53:00,166
"The problem, in my opinion,
is in our conception of the world.

372
00:53:00,334 --> 00:53:03,500
A positive view or a negative one.

373
00:53:03,667 --> 00:53:07,708
Greek tragedy was negative
in that it made Man

374
00:53:07,876 --> 00:53:11,500
a victim of Fate,
as embodied by the Gods,

375
00:53:11,667 --> 00:53:16,250
and abandoned him
to a hopeless destiny."

376
00:53:17,417 --> 00:53:22,791
Why do you say it's the open window?
There's something else.

377
00:53:25,459 --> 00:53:28,333
I think so.

378
00:53:28,501 --> 00:53:33,291
"Man can rebel against things
that are bad, false.

379
00:53:33,459 --> 00:53:39,083
We must rebel when we're trapped
by circumstances, conventions.

380
00:53:39,251 --> 00:53:43,416
But I don't think
murder is a solution.

381
00:53:43,584 --> 00:53:46,500
Crimes of passion serve no purpose.

382
00:53:46,667 --> 00:53:51,875
I love a woman,
she cheats on me, I kill her.

383
00:53:52,042 --> 00:53:57,083
What's left for me?
I lost her love since she's dead.

384
00:53:57,251 --> 00:54:01,791
If I kill her lover, she hates me,
and I still lose her love.

385
00:54:01,959 --> 00:54:05,625
Killing is never a solution."

386
00:54:06,667 --> 00:54:08,666
Look, Camille...

387
00:54:08,834 --> 00:54:14,750
I give you my word,
I can't sleep with the window open.

388
00:54:14,917 --> 00:54:18,416
I need silence and darkness.

389
00:54:20,542 --> 00:54:23,541
I swear it's true.

390
00:54:27,251 --> 00:54:30,833
And you move around too much.
You keep waking me.

391
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:34,125
I want to sleep alone from now on.

392
00:54:35,542 --> 00:54:38,458
You don't want to make love?

393
00:54:41,626 --> 00:54:45,000
Listen to this jerk.

394
00:54:45,167 --> 00:54:48,958
Is that a mocking smile
or a tender smile?

395
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:53,458
A tender smile.

396
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:59,958
- So, answer me!
- If it were true, I'd tell you.

397
00:55:00,126 --> 00:55:03,583
A woman can always find
an excuse not to make love.

398
00:55:03,751 --> 00:55:09,250
- But you're really a jerk.
- Vulgar language doesn't suit you.

399
00:55:10,209 --> 00:55:12,958
It doesn't suit me?

400
00:55:14,751 --> 00:55:17,833
Listen to this...

401
00:55:18,001 --> 00:55:22,125
Asshole. Cunt.

402
00:55:22,292 --> 00:55:24,666
Shit.

403
00:55:25,417 --> 00:55:27,750
Christ almighty.

404
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:30,916
Craphole.

405
00:55:31,959 --> 00:55:35,000
Son of a bitch.

406
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:37,833
Goddamn.

407
00:55:42,042 --> 00:55:46,583
So, still think
it doesn't suit me?

408
00:56:10,584 --> 00:56:14,375
Why don't you want
to make love anymore?

409
00:56:22,542 --> 00:56:27,625
All right. Let's do it, but fast.

410
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:34,041
I'd been thinking
Camille could leave me.

411
00:56:34,209 --> 00:56:39,916
It was a possible disaster.
Now the disaster had happened.

412
00:56:40,084 --> 00:56:43,958
We used to live
in a cloud of unawareness,

413
00:56:44,126 --> 00:56:46,833
in delighted complicity.

414
00:56:47,001 --> 00:56:52,000
Things happened with sudden,
wild, enchanted recklessness.

415
00:56:52,167 --> 00:56:58,458
I'd end up in Paul's arms,
hardly aware of what had happened.

416
00:56:58,626 --> 00:57:03,791
This recklessness was now absent
in Camille, and thus in me.

417
00:57:03,959 --> 00:57:08,125
Could I now watch her coldly,
prey to my excited senses,

418
00:57:08,292 --> 00:57:11,375
as she could undoubtedly observe me?

419
00:57:12,459 --> 00:57:17,500
I deliberately made that remark
with a secret feeling of revenge.

420
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:20,791
She seemed aware
that a lie could settle everything.

421
00:57:20,959 --> 00:57:26,666
For a while, on the surface at least.
She was clearly tempted to lie.

422
00:57:26,834 --> 00:57:29,958
But she thought better of it.

423
00:57:30,126 --> 00:57:32,208
Paul hurt me so much.

424
00:57:32,376 --> 00:57:35,708
It was my turn now,
alluding to what I'd seen,

425
00:57:35,876 --> 00:57:38,875
without really being specific.

426
00:57:40,209 --> 00:57:45,250
But I was wrong. She wasn't unfaithful,
or at least not obviously so.

427
00:57:45,417 --> 00:57:50,000
The truth remained concealed.
We needed to dig deeper.

428
00:57:51,626 --> 00:57:57,500
I've noticed that the more we doubt,
the more we cling to a false lucidity,

429
00:57:57,667 --> 00:58:04,291
in the hope of rationalizing
what feelings made murky and obscure.

430
00:58:04,459 --> 00:58:07,041
I thought Camille might leave me.

431
00:58:07,209 --> 00:58:11,750
It was a possible disaster.
Now the disaster had happened.

432
00:58:11,917 --> 00:58:17,958
We used to live in a cloud of
unawareness, in delicious complicity.

433
00:58:20,251 --> 00:58:23,708
Don't be like that.

434
00:58:27,084 --> 00:58:31,583
- Don't be like what?
- You know very well.

435
00:58:37,209 --> 00:58:39,916
It's your fault!

436
00:58:48,167 --> 00:58:53,708
You seem to be searching
my expression

437
00:58:53,876 --> 00:58:56,958
to decide the appropriate attitude.

438
00:59:02,876 --> 00:59:07,375
"The private plane awaited
in the blue sky.

439
00:59:10,001 --> 00:59:15,750
Rex noticed something about Paula
that he knew already, her face...

440
00:59:15,917 --> 00:59:21,625
Her harmonious face,
now indecisive, seemed contorted.

441
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:28,000
Rex knew this trait of hers,
for it seemed that whenever Paula...

442
00:59:28,167 --> 00:59:32,208
Whenever Paula
had to make a decision...

443
00:59:42,209 --> 00:59:45,416
that went against her nature..."

444
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:51,916
What's got into you?
I love you exactly as before.

445
01:00:07,709 --> 01:00:11,541
What would you do
if I stopped loving you?

446
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:16,208
- I already told you.
- I forgot what you said.

447
01:00:16,376 --> 01:00:20,750
I wouldn't do the script
and we'd sell the flat.

448
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:33,666
But I love you.
I find this all so idiotic.

449
01:00:35,292 --> 01:00:40,541
When Prokosch calls,
tell him you'll go to Capri.

450
01:00:53,667 --> 01:00:58,000
- What about you?
- I love you. Don't make me repeat it.

451
01:00:58,167 --> 01:01:01,333
I want to keep the flat.

452
01:01:01,501 --> 01:01:04,750
If you don't want to do the script,
don't do it.

453
01:01:04,917 --> 01:01:09,458
If you think I've stopped loving you,
you're wrong.

454
01:01:12,209 --> 01:01:14,791
Kiss me.

455
01:01:43,917 --> 01:01:46,958
We were just talking about you.

456
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:56,333
About your movie.

457
01:01:57,417 --> 01:02:01,791
Yes, The Odyssey.
About that guy who travels.

458
01:02:03,501 --> 01:02:08,958
In Capri,
can we go swimming?

459
01:02:13,209 --> 01:02:15,875
I don't know.

460
01:02:19,626 --> 01:02:23,041
Here's Paul. I'll put him on.

461
01:02:29,917 --> 01:02:33,333
Mr. Prokosch? Yes.

462
01:02:37,501 --> 01:02:39,583
No.

463
01:02:53,459 --> 01:02:55,083
We're eating out?

464
01:02:55,251 --> 01:02:59,083
I don't feel like
going out for groceries.

465
01:03:04,667 --> 01:03:09,750
Fine. We're to meet Prokosch
and Lang at a cinema.

466
01:03:09,917 --> 01:03:13,875
They want to see a singer
in the stage show. We can eat after.

467
01:03:14,042 --> 01:03:17,041
It'll be late if there's a movie first.

468
01:03:17,209 --> 01:03:20,791
It might give me some ideas.

469
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:30,041
Why not look for ideas in your head,
instead of stealing them?

470
01:03:30,209 --> 01:03:36,041
- What's got into you?
- Let's get going!

471
01:03:36,209 --> 01:03:41,958
I knew it. Since I said yes
to Prokosch, it's no more tenderness!

472
01:03:42,126 --> 01:03:48,541
Right, no more caresses.
What was the phone call about?

473
01:03:48,709 --> 01:03:52,541
- Our going to Capri.
- What did you say?

474
01:03:52,709 --> 01:03:58,125
- That it was up to you.
- Are you nuts?

475
01:03:58,292 --> 01:04:02,291
You know that it's up to you, not me!

476
01:04:02,459 --> 01:04:06,416
- Then come to Capri.
- No.

477
01:04:06,584 --> 01:04:10,250
Is there something
between you and Prokosch?

478
01:04:10,417 --> 01:04:13,458
You're pathetic.

479
01:04:20,292 --> 01:04:24,916
- Sit down. I have to talk to you.
- What about the cinema?

480
01:04:25,084 --> 01:04:27,833
Camille, I need to talk to you.

481
01:04:30,834 --> 01:04:34,208
All right, I'm listening.

482
01:04:34,376 --> 01:04:39,250
I need... to talk to you.

483
01:04:43,334 --> 01:04:47,375
Earlier, before the phone rang,

484
01:04:48,667 --> 01:04:54,666
I said I didn't want to take this job
if I couldn't be sure of your love.

485
01:04:56,167 --> 01:05:03,208
You said you loved me
and that I should take it.

486
01:05:04,334 --> 01:05:07,125
Yes.

487
01:05:08,167 --> 01:05:10,916
I'm sure you lied.

488
01:05:12,459 --> 01:05:18,750
Why? I don't know.
Out of pity, self-interest...

489
01:05:18,917 --> 01:05:25,833
- What self-interest?
- You holding on to this flat.

490
01:05:26,001 --> 01:05:29,250
How can you know what I think?

491
01:05:29,417 --> 01:05:36,083
In fact, I couldn't care less.
You can sell the flat, I don't care.

492
01:05:36,251 --> 01:05:39,541
You said it was better than a hotel.

493
01:05:39,709 --> 01:05:45,750
Not at all.
I said that to make you happy.

494
01:05:45,917 --> 01:05:52,166
That's beside the point.
I want to know why you lied earlier.

495
01:05:52,334 --> 01:05:54,708
Who said I lied? Stop it!

496
01:05:54,876 --> 01:05:58,416
You did. You've stopped loving me.

497
01:05:59,459 --> 01:06:02,208
What good will
knowing the truth do you?

498
01:06:02,376 --> 01:06:05,000
See? You admit I'm right.

499
01:06:05,167 --> 01:06:09,583
I'm not admitting anything.
Leave me alone.

500
01:06:11,751 --> 01:06:15,500
It's true. I don't love you anymore.

501
01:06:19,042 --> 01:06:22,333
There's nothing to explain.
I don't love you.

502
01:06:22,501 --> 01:06:27,166
Why? Yesterday you still loved me.

503
01:06:27,334 --> 01:06:31,375
Yes, very much.

504
01:06:31,542 --> 01:06:35,000
Now it's over.

505
01:06:35,167 --> 01:06:41,916
- There must be a reason.
- Yes, there must be.

506
01:06:42,084 --> 01:06:44,166
What is it?

507
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:49,541
I don't know. All I know is
I don't love you anymore.

508
01:06:50,584 --> 01:06:53,375
Since we were at Prokosch's?

509
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:58,125
When you saw me pat
Francesca Vanini's bottom?

510
01:07:01,167 --> 01:07:07,041
Let's say it was that.
It's over now. Let's drop the subject.

511
01:07:09,834 --> 01:07:13,291
Something's happened
since this morning.

512
01:07:13,459 --> 01:07:19,416
It changed your mind about me,
and therefore, your love for me.

513
01:07:21,959 --> 01:07:26,583
- You're nuts, but you're clever.
- Then it's true.

514
01:07:32,876 --> 01:07:39,125
I didn't say that.
I said you're clever.

515
01:07:40,376 --> 01:07:44,666
Was it something I said or did today
that you took the wrong way?

516
01:07:44,834 --> 01:07:46,625
Maybe.

517
01:07:46,792 --> 01:07:51,208
Don't talk to me like that!
I won't allow it!

518
01:08:00,126 --> 01:08:02,416
Camille!

519
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:12,916
I despise you! That's what I feel.

520
01:08:13,084 --> 01:08:16,166
That's why the love's gone.

521
01:08:16,334 --> 01:08:20,041
And you disgust me when you touch me.

522
01:08:32,459 --> 01:08:35,666
Wait for me. Don't be so dramatic.

523
01:08:39,959 --> 01:08:45,000
Forget what I said, Paul.
Pretend nothing happened.

524
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:51,125
Good evening.

525
01:09:58,334 --> 01:10:02,583
- Are you going to Capri, too?
- Maybe.

526
01:10:25,542 --> 01:10:28,083
Are you okay?

527
01:11:31,584 --> 01:11:34,625
Mr. Prokosch re-read Homer.

528
01:11:39,542 --> 01:11:44,208
He found something
he had long been searching for.

529
01:11:50,667 --> 01:11:56,541
Something as indispensable
to the movies as to real life.

530
01:11:56,709 --> 01:11:58,500
Poetry.

531
01:12:00,876 --> 01:12:04,708
- You remember...
- Oh, yes.

532
01:12:06,751 --> 01:12:10,583
They say Ulysses came home
to Penelope,

533
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:14,041
but maybe Ulysses had been
fed up with Penelope.

534
01:12:14,209 --> 01:12:19,625
So he went off to the Trojan war, and
since he didn't feel like going home,

535
01:12:19,792 --> 01:12:22,375
he kept travelling as long as he could.

536
01:12:22,542 --> 01:12:26,291
Do you think it was
an idea of his or...?

537
01:12:36,251 --> 01:12:40,416
- Why do you despise me?
- Leave me alone!

538
01:12:55,167 --> 01:12:58,625
Coming to Capri with us, Mr. Lang?

539
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:06,041
"Each morning, to earn my bread
I go to the market where lies are sold

540
01:13:06,917 --> 01:13:10,916
and, full of hope, I line up
alongside the other vendors."

541
01:13:11,084 --> 01:13:14,750
- What's that?
- Hollywood.

542
01:13:14,917 --> 01:13:18,041
From a ballad by poor B.B.

543
01:13:19,417 --> 01:13:22,083
- Bertolt Brecht?
- Yes.

544
01:13:31,751 --> 01:13:35,375
Homer's world is a real world.

545
01:13:35,542 --> 01:13:39,000
And the poet belonged to a civilization

546
01:13:39,167 --> 01:13:45,750
that grew in harmony,
not in opposition, with nature.

547
01:13:45,917 --> 01:13:48,541
And the beauty of The Odyssey

548
01:13:48,709 --> 01:13:55,291
lies precisely in this belief
in reality as it is.

549
01:13:55,459 --> 01:13:58,750
Thus in reality
as it appears objectively.

550
01:13:58,917 --> 01:14:05,708
Exactly. And in a form
that cannot be broken down.

551
01:14:05,876 --> 01:14:10,208
And is what it is.
Take it or leave it.

552
01:14:13,667 --> 01:14:17,291
I shut up because I have nothing to say.

553
01:14:30,459 --> 01:14:35,416
I'm not sure about going to Capri.
Where would we stay?

554
01:14:38,459 --> 01:14:41,875
In Mr. Prokosch's villa.

555
01:14:44,334 --> 01:14:49,083
- With your husband.
- And Mr. Lang too?

556
01:14:53,042 --> 01:14:54,916
That's up to him.

557
01:14:55,084 --> 01:15:00,500
Producers are something
I can easily do without.

558
01:15:00,667 --> 01:15:03,750
- Madam.
- Goodnight.

559
01:15:29,417 --> 01:15:34,125
If you don't want to come,
I'm not forcing you.

560
01:15:34,292 --> 01:15:39,875
It's not you that's forcing me.
It's life.

561
01:16:08,417 --> 01:16:11,458
What are you doing?

562
01:16:14,001 --> 01:16:18,291
- What are you doing?
- Looking.

563
01:16:18,459 --> 01:16:22,291
Don't stay by yourself. Join us.

564
01:16:22,459 --> 01:16:27,166
- What were you talking about?
- The Odyssey.

565
01:16:27,334 --> 01:16:32,708
- I agree with Prokosch's theory.
- What theory's that?

566
01:16:32,876 --> 01:16:37,875
That Ulysses loves his wife,
but she doesn't love him.

567
01:16:39,126 --> 01:16:44,958
Do you really think that?
I'm sure you don't.

568
01:16:51,084 --> 01:16:55,875
- Please, you're in the frame.
- Places, everyone!

569
01:17:35,459 --> 01:17:41,000
Are they going to strip off?
Marvellous business this!

570
01:17:41,167 --> 01:17:46,541
You show women in dresses a camera,
and hey presto! They strip off!

571
01:17:59,209 --> 01:18:02,666
Come with us, madam,
leave them here to talk.

572
01:18:02,834 --> 01:18:06,000
No, I'll walk back later
with my husband.

573
01:18:12,001 --> 01:18:17,208
He says you spend all day
with your husband.

574
01:18:19,626 --> 01:18:22,958
Do you mind if you wife comes with us?

575
01:18:23,126 --> 01:18:28,416
Not at all. Go on, Camille.
Go on.

576
01:18:30,917 --> 01:18:36,291
I don't mind, go on.

577
01:18:36,459 --> 01:18:41,125
I'll walk back with Mr. Lang
to discuss The Odyssey.

578
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:18,416
The girls are in the water, Mr Lang.

579
01:19:18,584 --> 01:19:21,708
I should have done a scene
at the beginning

580
01:19:21,876 --> 01:19:28,500
in which the gods
discuss man's fate, in general,

581
01:19:28,667 --> 01:19:32,125
and the fate of Ulysses in particular.

582
01:20:08,001 --> 01:20:11,833
A producer
can be a friend to a director.

583
01:20:12,001 --> 01:20:17,875
But Prokosch isn't a real producer.
He's a dictator.

584
01:20:18,042 --> 01:20:23,416
I think it's stupid to change
the character of Ulysses.

585
01:20:23,584 --> 01:20:27,250
He's not a modern-day neurotic,

586
01:20:27,417 --> 01:20:33,125
but a simple, clever and robust man.

587
01:20:33,292 --> 01:20:36,250
I find his idea interesting.

588
01:20:36,417 --> 01:20:39,541
It takes Ulysses
ten years to return home

589
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:43,541
because he doesn't really
want to return. It's logical.

590
01:20:43,709 --> 01:20:49,791
It's logical, and the illogical
borrows from the logical.

591
01:20:49,959 --> 01:20:54,458
Your Corneille said it
in his preface to Suréna.

592
01:20:54,626 --> 01:20:59,291
Ulysses doesn't rush home to Ithaca

593
01:20:59,459 --> 01:21:03,375
because he was unhappy
with Penelope,

594
01:21:03,542 --> 01:21:08,125
but the trouble started
before he went off to war.

595
01:21:14,209 --> 01:21:17,666
He never would've left
if he'd been happy.

596
01:21:17,834 --> 01:21:21,333
The Trojan war was his excuse
to get away from her.

597
01:21:21,501 --> 01:21:25,500
But he killed her suitors, didn't he?

598
01:21:25,667 --> 01:21:29,958
That can be justified
by the fact that, at first,

599
01:21:30,126 --> 01:21:34,333
Ulysses had told Penelope
to accept their gifts.

600
01:21:34,501 --> 01:21:38,333
He didn't see the suitors
as serious rivals,

601
01:21:38,501 --> 01:21:42,291
and didn't want to cause a scandal
by throwing them out.

602
01:21:42,459 --> 01:21:49,000
Knowing Penelope to be faithful,
he told her to be nice to the suitors.

603
01:21:55,834 --> 01:22:02,458
I think that's when Penelope,
who is a simple woman at heart,

604
01:22:03,626 --> 01:22:06,750
began to despise him.

605
01:22:06,917 --> 01:22:11,916
She found she'd stopped loving
Ulysses because of his behaviour,

606
01:22:12,084 --> 01:22:14,541
and she told him so.

607
01:22:14,709 --> 01:22:19,208
Ulysses then realized too late
he'd lost Penelope's love

608
01:22:19,376 --> 01:22:23,208
because he'd been overly cautious.

609
01:22:24,251 --> 01:22:29,458
The only way to win her back
was to murder the suitors.

610
01:22:29,626 --> 01:22:33,083
Death is no resolution.

611
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:09,125
Camille!

612
01:25:17,417 --> 01:25:21,500
- What a lovely yellow.
- Thanks.

613
01:25:23,834 --> 01:25:26,625
I found this on the boat.

614
01:25:26,792 --> 01:25:30,500
Children shouldn't play with firearms.

615
01:26:18,292 --> 01:26:20,375
Drink?

616
01:26:20,542 --> 01:26:24,583
I was there, outside. Nothing.

617
01:26:58,667 --> 01:27:02,416
I decided not to write
the script you asked me.

618
01:27:05,084 --> 01:27:07,708
Why?

619
01:27:07,876 --> 01:27:11,125
Can I be frank?

620
01:27:15,126 --> 01:27:17,750
Of course.

621
01:27:21,042 --> 01:27:26,625
I'm a playwright.
Not a screenwriter.

622
01:27:31,959 --> 01:27:37,500
Even if it's a fine script...
I'm only doing it for the money!

623
01:27:43,959 --> 01:27:47,791
That's why I'm in a bad mood.

624
01:27:50,334 --> 01:27:55,416
We all have an ideal.
Mine's writing plays. I can't. Why?

625
01:27:57,584 --> 01:28:02,708
In today's world,
we have to accept what others want.

626
01:28:04,876 --> 01:28:07,833
Why does money matter so much
in what we do,

627
01:28:08,001 --> 01:28:10,958
in what we are, in what we become?

628
01:28:12,667 --> 01:28:16,333
Even in our relationships
with those we love.

629
01:28:25,876 --> 01:28:28,666
He is right.

630
01:28:30,001 --> 01:28:33,958
We either do Homer's Odyssey
or we do nothing!

631
01:28:39,709 --> 01:28:43,708
Mr. Prokosch already said it,
you're wrong.

632
01:28:43,876 --> 01:28:47,000
You aspire to a world like Homer's.

633
01:28:47,167 --> 01:28:50,833
You want it to exist,
but unfortunately it doesn't.

634
01:28:51,001 --> 01:28:54,125
Why doesn't it?

635
01:29:01,042 --> 01:29:03,958
You may be right,

636
01:29:04,126 --> 01:29:09,958
but when it comes to making movies,
dreams aren't enough.

637
01:29:16,834 --> 01:29:19,583
When do we eat?

638
01:29:22,917 --> 01:29:27,708
- In an hour.
- Right. I'm going for a walk.

639
01:29:36,626 --> 01:29:39,083
Mr. Prokosch wants to speak with you.

640
01:29:44,709 --> 01:29:50,000
- Is that an order or a request?
- A request.

641
01:29:56,417 --> 01:29:59,208
One must suffer.

642
01:30:01,209 --> 01:30:03,833
That's for sure.

643
01:30:15,417 --> 01:30:17,625
Camille!

644
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:06,791
It's me, Paul.

645
01:31:12,792 --> 01:31:17,916
Looking at you just now,
felt like the first time I'd seen you.

646
01:31:29,959 --> 01:31:35,291
- Mind if I stay?
- Stay if you like.

647
01:31:55,084 --> 01:31:58,208
Why didn't you speak up earlier?

648
01:31:58,376 --> 01:32:02,541
I don't get you! You always said
you loved that script.

649
01:32:02,709 --> 01:32:08,666
Now you tell the producer it's for the
money, that your ideal is the theatre.

650
01:32:09,834 --> 01:32:14,708
He's no fool.
Next time, he won't be asking you.

651
01:32:14,876 --> 01:32:19,541
How can you not understand
something so simple?

652
01:32:21,626 --> 01:32:26,291
- I bet you'll do it anyway.
- No.

653
01:32:26,459 --> 01:32:31,375
Yes, you'll see. I know you.

654
01:32:33,584 --> 01:32:35,666
I know you.

655
01:32:35,834 --> 01:32:40,708
If I do it, it's for you.
To pay for the flat.

656
01:32:40,876 --> 01:32:44,666
I'll let you decide
whether I do the script or not.

657
01:32:44,834 --> 01:32:48,500
If you say no, we'll leave.

658
01:32:48,667 --> 01:32:53,000
- You're so cunning!
- Not at all. Why?

659
01:32:53,167 --> 01:32:58,916
- If you regret it, you can blame me.
- Not at all! I'm asking you to decide.

660
01:32:59,084 --> 01:33:01,666
You want me to tell you what to do?

661
01:33:01,834 --> 01:33:05,125
- Yes.
- Then do the script!

662
01:33:05,292 --> 01:33:09,208
You signed a contract,
and you're boring me.

663
01:33:12,084 --> 01:33:16,666
- I saw him kiss you earlier.
- I know you did.

664
01:33:19,959 --> 01:33:24,791
- Why don't you love me anymore?
- That's life.

665
01:33:25,917 --> 01:33:29,583
Why do you despise me?

666
01:33:29,751 --> 01:33:34,041
I'll never tell you,
not even if I were dying.

667
01:33:38,792 --> 01:33:43,791
- Tell me or I'll hurt you.
- Why hurt me more?

668
01:33:47,001 --> 01:33:50,041
I have to know why you despise me.

669
01:33:50,209 --> 01:33:55,583
It's crazy! I don't see why
you expect me to accept, anyway.

670
01:33:55,751 --> 01:34:00,083
We need the money for the flat.
I don't want to go back to typing.

671
01:34:00,251 --> 01:34:06,000
I can't accept that after what happened.
Obviously you do despise me.

672
01:34:22,626 --> 01:34:26,791
You knew we kissed and you were
still ready to change your mind.

673
01:34:26,959 --> 01:34:33,041
I turned the job down for you.
So you'd change your mind about me.

674
01:34:33,209 --> 01:34:37,875
Don't touch me.
I don't love you anymore.

675
01:34:38,042 --> 01:34:42,041
There's no way
I'll ever love you again.

676
01:34:42,209 --> 01:34:45,708
Even if I turn it down,
you'll despise me?

677
01:34:45,876 --> 01:34:51,625
- Yes, I will.
- Why? There must be a reason.

678
01:34:51,792 --> 01:34:57,291
- You're the reason.
- What do you mean, me?

679
01:34:57,459 --> 01:35:00,750
I don't know. You're not a man.

680
01:35:01,792 --> 01:35:07,416
Anyhow, it's too late.
I've changed my mind about you.

681
01:35:08,876 --> 01:35:14,166
I know why you despise me.
The other day, when I took a taxi,

682
01:35:14,334 --> 01:35:19,208
you thought I wanted you
to go in his car with him.

683
01:35:20,709 --> 01:35:24,333
And again on the boat earlier.
Don't be stupid!

684
01:35:24,501 --> 01:35:26,791
I have faults, but that's not one.

685
01:35:26,959 --> 01:35:32,958
I'll never forgive you.
I loved you so much.

686
01:35:35,251 --> 01:35:42,208
Now it's impossible. I hate you
because you can't make me feel.

687
01:35:42,376 --> 01:35:45,500
I can! You're almost in tears.

688
01:35:57,792 --> 01:36:01,333
We're leaving! We'll pack up and go.

689
01:36:01,501 --> 01:36:05,958
I'm staying. You go if you like.

690
01:36:06,126 --> 01:36:09,166
Come on, Camille!

691
01:36:10,626 --> 01:36:14,083
- No.
- Then I'm staying, too.

692
01:36:14,251 --> 01:36:20,375
- But Prokosch will throw us out.
- Don't start again.

693
01:37:01,417 --> 01:37:06,291
Dear Paul, I found your revolver
and took the bullets out.

694
01:37:06,459 --> 01:37:09,875
If you won't leave, I will.

695
01:37:10,042 --> 01:37:15,458
Jeremy Prokosch has to return to Rome,
so I'll get a lift with him.

696
01:37:15,626 --> 01:37:19,625
Then I'll probably move
into a hotel alone.

697
01:37:19,792 --> 01:37:23,916
Take care. Farewell. Camille.

698
01:38:02,626 --> 01:38:06,375
What are you going to do in Rome?

699
01:38:08,334 --> 01:38:11,125
Typist.

700
01:38:16,292 --> 01:38:19,041
Me? No.

701
01:38:19,959 --> 01:38:22,541
Typist.

702
01:38:46,626 --> 01:38:51,791
What... do you think... of me?

703
01:38:52,876 --> 01:38:57,166
Get into your Alfa, Romeo.
We'll see about that later.

704
01:38:57,334 --> 01:39:02,333
TAKE CARE

705
01:39:08,792 --> 01:39:13,458
FAREWELL

706
01:40:11,417 --> 01:40:15,041
Nathalie,
I'm leaving for Rome tonight.

707
01:40:15,209 --> 01:40:18,250
Good-bye, then.

708
01:40:59,459 --> 01:41:03,750
Mr. Lang,
I've come to say good-bye.

709
01:41:03,917 --> 01:41:07,291
Good-bye. What will you do?

710
01:41:07,459 --> 01:41:12,166
Go back to Rome, finish my play.

711
01:41:13,292 --> 01:41:16,250
- And you?
- I'll finish the film.

712
01:41:16,417 --> 01:41:20,541
One should always finish
what one starts.

713
01:41:20,709 --> 01:41:23,541
What shot are you doing?

714
01:41:23,709 --> 01:41:28,583
Ulysses' gaze when he first sees
his homeland again.

715
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:32,208
Ithaca.

716
01:41:33,917 --> 01:41:38,333
- Good-bye, Mr. Lang.
- Bye. I hope we'll meet again.

717
01:41:42,042 --> 01:41:44,666
We're ready, Mr. Lang.

718
01:41:44,834 --> 01:41:47,916
Quiet on the set!

719
01:41:49,542 --> 01:41:52,416
Camera!

720
01:42:44,667 --> 01:42:47,750
Silence!

721
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,063
