Cinematografia Champion.

15
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:11,286
André Bazin said: "Cinema shows us
a world that fits our desires."

16
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:17,121
Contempt is the story of that world.

17
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:34,373
I don't know.

18
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:39,371
Maybe I'll go to Mum's.
I don't know what I'll do afterwards.

19
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:47,996
Come pick me up if you want.
At 4 o'clock. At Cinecittà.

20
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,921
I have to talk to that American.

21
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,461
Maybe I will.

22
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:06,621
- See my feet in the mirror?
- Yes.

23
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,500
- Think they're pretty?
- Very.

24
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:20,078
- You like my ankles?
- Yes.

25
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:25,751
And my knees, too?

26
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:30,251
Yes. I really like your knees.

27
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:36,001
And my thighs?

28
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,920
And your thighs.

29
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,120
Do you see my bottom in the mirror?

30
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:52,081
Yes.

31
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:57,746
Do you think I have nice buttocks?

32
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,578
Yes. Very.

33
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:08,366
- Shall I get on my knees?
- No.

34
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:16,120
- No need to.
- And my breasts. You like them?

35
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:23,421
- Yes, tremendously.
- Gently, Paul. Not so hard.

36
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,955
Sorry.

37
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:35,423
Which do you like better,
my breasts or my nipples?

38
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:42,618
I don't know. Both equally.

39
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:50,670
- And do you like my shoulders?
- Yes.

40
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:57,120
- I don't think they're round enough.
- I do.

41
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,366
And my arms?

42
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,830
And my face?

43
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:18,578
- And your face.
- All of it?

44
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:23,250
My mouth, my eyes,
my nose, my ears?

45
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:29,866
- Yes, everything.
- Then you love me totally.

46
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:36,956
I love you totally,
tenderly, tragically.

47
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,458
So do l, Paul.

48
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:50,325
Hi. How are you?
What's going on? The place is empty!

49
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,040
Jerry fired nearly everybody.
Italian cinema is in trouble.

50
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:59,958
- Where is he?
- Over there.

51
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,623
Only yesterday
there were kings here.

52
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,035
Princesses, lovers...

53
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,461
All human emotions.

54
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,621
Yesterday he sold everything.

55
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:13,455
They're going to build
a supermarket.

56
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:21,003
- It's the end of cinema.
- I don't think cinema will ever die.

57
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,040
He says you wrote Toto against
Hercules. It's doing well in New York.

58
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,918
Not bad.

59
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:45,208
Don't be modest,
You need pride to make good films.

60
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:50,035
- Do you know The Odyssey?
- Your film with Fritz Lang?

61
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:58,673
- It's not working out.
- Why did you hire Lang?

62
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:10,580
The Odyssey needs a German director
because a German discovered Troy.

63
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:15,080
What should I do?

64
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:34,291
He needs new scenes for The Odyssey,
not only more sex, but more...

65
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:37,918
Like all producers,
he doesn't know.

66
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:54,171
To know that one doesn't know
is the gift of a superior spirit.

67
00:08:57,041 --> 00:09:00,921
Not to know and think that one knows
is a mistake.

68
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
To know it is a mistake
keeps one from making it.

69
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,705
I don't think Lang will accept.

70
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:24,171
In '33, Goebbels asked Lang to head the
German film industry. Lang left Germany.

71
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:41,461
This is not '33 and Mr. Prokosch
knows you'll do the job.

72
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,115
Why?

73
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:53,245
He'll tell you during the projection.
This way.

74
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:28,705
So... Why?

75
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:37,871
- Because you need money.
- How does he know?

76
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:50,293
He was told you have
a very beautiful wife.

77
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,918
Each film should have
a definite point of view.

78
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:22,036
It's the eternal problem
of the ancient Greeks.

79
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:36,751
It's a fight against the gods.
The fight of Ulysses.

80
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,826
This is Minerva, isn't it?

81
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:39,081
She's Ulysses' protector.

82
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:46,076
And that's Neptune,
his mortal enemy.

83
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:32,325
Mr. Prokosch likes gods.

84
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,916
He knows how they feel.

85
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:55,326
Look, that's Homer.

86
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:01,040
The gods did not create man,
man created gods.

87
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,498
It's a mermaid.

88
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:28,833
That's art,
but will the public understand?

89
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:42,581
- Who's that?
- Penelope.

90
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:53,293
Mr. Prokosch has a theory
about The Odyssey.

91
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:57,498
He thinks Ulysses' wife
was unfaithful.

92
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:20,455
O my brothers, who braved
100,000 perils to reach the West,

93
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:26,495
don't refuse to know, by following
the sun, the uninhabited world.

94
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:33,036
"Consider your origin.
You were not born to live as brutes,

95
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:36,668
but to pursue virtue and knowledge."

96
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:43,366
- Have you heard that before?
- Yes, it's very famous. Dante.

97
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,870
"Night then looked all the stars.

98
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:02,671
Ourjoy soon turned to tears

99
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,748
until the sea closed in on us."

100
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:17,328
- I'm Paul Javal. Mr. Prokosch...
- I know.

101
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,620
It looks swell.
I really like Cinemascope.

102
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:26,251
It wasn't made for people
but for snakes and funerals.

103
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:54,288
What's the matter, Miss Vanini?
Is it about the script?

104
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:28,788
He says it's not the same
on screen as on paper.

105
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,420
I'll just see if my wife's arrived.

106
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:06,708
...the Nazis used to say "revolver"
instead of "cheque book".

107
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:27,536
Are you going to accept the job?
Yes or no?

108
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:08,865
"But Man, when he must, can stand
fearless and alone before God.

109
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:14,371
His candour is his shield.
He needs neither arms nor wiles

110
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:18,621
until such time
as God's absence helps him."

111
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:23,711
- That's Hölderlin, isn't it?
-Yes. The Poet's Vocation.

112
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:29,333
The final line is obscure.
Hölderlin originally wrote...

113
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:38,501
- "So long as God is not present."
- And then...

114
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,623
"So long as God is close to us."

115
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:51,501
The way the last lines are written,
when you've read the other two,

116
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,788
is no longer about God's presence.

117
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:59,248
It's God's absence
that reassures Man.

118
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:02,996
Strange, but true.

119
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:09,496
How do you say "strange" in Italian?

120
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,421
I'll be back in five minutes.

121
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:05,455
Meet Mr. Prokosch.
Camille, my wife.

122
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,710
- My wife, Camille.
- How do you do?

123
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:19,665
- Fritz Lang.
- Hello.

124
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:22,963
He's the one who did
that western with Dietrich.

125
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:27,325
- It was terrific!
- I prefer M.

126
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,790
We just saw it on TV.
I really liked it.

127
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:33,788
Thank you. That's kind of you.

128
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:39,118
I love the scene
when Ferrer leans on the scales.

129
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,871
Thank you.
When l finish The Odyssey...

130
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:50,923
Mr. Prokosch is inviting you
for a drink.

131
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,923
I don't know.

132
00:22:56,791 --> 00:23:01,211
- He says you know perfectly.
- Me?

133
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:07,498
Yes, I could have a drink.

134
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:16,463
Goodbye, I'll phone you.
Madam.

135
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,920
We'll go if you want.

136
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:32,333
Sit down, madam.

137
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:38,003
- You won't be comfortable...
- I'll meet you there.

138
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,996
- Mr. Prokosch will come back for you.
- No, I'll grab a taxi.

139
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:45,326
Let him go on ahead.
We can both take a cab.

140
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,580
Make up your mind.

141
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,620
Come on, you go.

142
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,501
What's the address?

143
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:50,543
- What did he say?
- My English is as bad as yours.

144
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,750
We've been waiting half an hour.
What kept you?

145
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:13,416
Nothing. l had an accident...

146
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:19,123
I was in the cab,
and at the corner of the street...

147
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:25,291
Two cars, you know...
The whole bumper was hanging off.

148
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:29,828
Then the two drivers
started shouting at each other.

149
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:37,250
- I needed another cab. That's why...
- That's why, what?

150
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:45,325
What? Why I'm late.
I had to walk God knows how long...

151
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:49,830
From Saint-Ange to Piazza Venezia
to find a cab.

152
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:56,963
Yeah, it took ages.

153
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:08,621
Anyway, l don't give a damn.
I'm not interested in your story.

154
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:15,665
It took me 20 minutes.

155
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:22,373
- You don't believe me.
- We'll discuss it later.

156
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:26,865
I'm going for a walk.

157
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:10,665
- Come tomorrow to sign the contract.
- All right.

158
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:16,326
Camille, why are you so quiet?

159
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:06,416
Friday we shoot in Capri.
Come with us.

160
00:29:06,583 --> 00:29:11,373
Answer her.
Why don't you speak?

161
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:18,330
- What were you doing before I arrived?
- Nothing special.

162
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,620
Why? Did he come on to you?

163
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:26,955
- Why ask me that?
- Just because.

164
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:36,213
I should wash my hands.

165
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:47,543
- Where can I wash?
- Upstairs, on the right.

166
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:58,961
- What's the matter? You look down.
- Nothing.

167
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:05,165
Have you been crying?

168
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:10,995
- Your boss is a hard man.
- He is.

169
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:16,963
Known him long?

170
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:26,830
- What did he do before movies?
- I don't want to talk about it.

171
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,960
I was just asking.

172
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:34,745
It's stupid to be so sweet
and so sad.

173
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:38,866
Haven't you anything
more amusing to say?

174
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:41,961
More amusing?

175
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,041
A funny story.

176
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:50,463
Which one shall I tell?

177
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:56,956
I know, the one about
Sri Ramakrishna and his disciple.

178
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:06,830
Ramakrishna was a Hindu sage.

179
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,920
He had this disciple who didn't believe
in his master's teachings anymore.

180
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:19,165
He decided to study on his own.
So he went away.

181
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:23,713
After 15 years, he came back
and said: "I've found it!"

182
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:26,325
Found what?

183
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:32,000
He tells the sage: "I'll show you"
and takes him to the riverbank.

184
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:36,956
The disciple crosses back and forth
walking on the water.

185
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:42,745
And he says: "You see? I can cross
without getting wet, now I know."

186
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:47,543
So Ramakrishna replies:

187
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:52,618
"You fool! I did that 10 years ago
with a rupee and a rowboat!"

188
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:01,963
Feeling better now?
That's good.

189
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:06,828
- Paul.
- What?

190
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,500
- Call that washing your hands?
- As you can see.

191
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:18,576
- I was just telling her the joke...
- I believe you already.

192
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,580
You're being an idiot.

193
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:25,710
- Where can I pee?
- Up there.

194
00:32:35,416 --> 00:32:39,786
It's a book about Roman paintings,
it will help you.

195
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,458
The Odyssey is in Greek.

196
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:53,543
He knows.

197
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,040
What? About what?

198
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:31,495
About the money and your wife.

199
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:48,370
Mr. Prokosch is inviting you
for dinner.

200
00:33:48,541 --> 00:33:51,371
I'm tired, I'd rather leave.

201
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,670
Tell them we're leaving.

202
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:02,621
We're leaving then.

203
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:10,498
If you decide about Capri,
call tonight.

204
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:16,076
- We must get the villa ready.
- Paul will call you.

205
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:21,285
Why don't you come?

206
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:24,248
It's my husband who decides.

207
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:35,120
What interests you about The Odyssey?

208
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:39,041
I don't know yet.

209
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:43,368
Maybe because it's the opposite
of today's films which l hate.

210
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:49,211
I'd like to return to Griffith
and Chaplin.

211
00:34:50,916 --> 00:34:53,866
Like in the days of United Artists.

212
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:05,206
The wise man does not oppress others
with his superiority.

213
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:13,078
He doesn't humiliate them
for their impotence.

214
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:36,955
He's crazy!
Did you see? He kicked me!

215
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:42,785
You change your mind fast.
Monday you thought he was terrific.

216
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:55,750
Now I think he's a jerk.
I have a right to change my mind.

217
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,710
What happened in the past hour?

218
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:08,415
Nothing. lf you're happy, so am l.

219
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:37,665
Rio Bravo is playing in town.

220
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:43,290
So is Nicholas Ray's Bigger Than Life.

221
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:46,868
I'm not interested.

222
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:50,541
- I wrote it.
- I know.

223
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:55,873
I phoned your mum's at lunchtime.
There was no answer.

224
00:36:56,041 --> 00:37:00,371
We ate here.
I didn't feel like going out.

225
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:09,123
I like living here.
It's better than a hotel.

226
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:12,001
See? l was right.

227
00:37:13,791 --> 00:37:16,461
What are they paying
for the script?

228
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:20,165
10,000 dollars. Six million lire.

229
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:24,713
We can finish paying off the flat.
Isn't that great?

230
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,535
Yes, it's great.

231
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:43,213
When will you call your friend
about the curtains? It's annoying me.

232
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:45,915
Once he's back from Spain.

233
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:48,793
Roberto said he'd be back on Friday.

234
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:57,711
Red velvet. lt's that or nothing.

235
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,285
Okay.

236
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:06,618
- Set the table while I take a bath?
- I wanted to take a bath, too.

237
00:38:06,791 --> 00:38:09,831
You go first. I can do some work.

238
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:16,001
No, I'll go later, while it's cooking.

239
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:21,365
You're cooking fagioliniagain?

240
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:25,116
Yes, whether you like it or not.

241
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:29,621
- I can set the table.
- I was just doing it.

242
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:14,581
I bought myself something today.
Tell me what you think.

243
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,420
What did you buy?

244
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:24,790
What?

245
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:29,078
- Don't look yet.
- You want to go to Capri?

246
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:41,920
- What?
- You want us to go to Capri?

247
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:48,373
I won't say no,
but I won't say yes either.

248
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:50,791
It would be like a holiday.

249
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:57,213
- Anyway, he didn't invite me.
- What?

250
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:03,373
He invited you, not me.

251
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,120
Where did we put the mirror?

252
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,210
Not at all. We were both invited.

253
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,580
Look.

254
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:46,920
- Doesn't it suit me?
- No, I prefer you as a blonde.

255
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:51,043
And l prefer you
without a hat and cigar.

256
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:55,618
It's just to look like Dean Martin
in Some Came Running.

257
00:40:55,791 --> 00:41:00,921
- What a laugh!
- What is?

258
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,753
You may want to look
like Dean Martin,

259
00:41:03,916 --> 00:41:08,366
but it's more like Martin's ass.
- Who's that?

260
00:41:08,541 --> 00:41:13,331
Never read the adventures
of Martin's ass?

261
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:18,080
One day he goes to Baghdad
to buy a flying carpet.

262
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:21,290
He finds this really nice one,

263
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:24,618
so he sits on it,
but it doesn't take off.

264
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:27,751
"Hardly surprising,"
says the carpet seller...

265
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:31,116
- Are you listening?
- Yes.

266
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:36,421
"The carpet won't take off
if you think about an ass."

267
00:41:36,583 --> 00:41:40,123
So Martin says:
"Okay, I won't think of an ass."

268
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:45,081
But automatically he thinks of one,
so the carpet doesn't fly.

269
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:49,080
What's that got to do with me?

270
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:53,330
- That's my point exactly.
- Well, l don't get it.

271
00:41:58,375 --> 00:42:01,865
Never mind.
Are you finished?

272
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:06,791
No need to change the water.
I didn't use soap.

273
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:18,003
You've been acting weird.
What's wrong?

274
00:42:18,166 --> 00:42:23,286
Nothing. l knew you'd say that.

275
00:42:25,416 --> 00:42:28,036
Is it about that girl?

276
00:42:28,208 --> 00:42:33,498
It's nothing, l tell you.
I simply said you were an ass.

277
00:42:39,375 --> 00:42:42,205
Not the same sound all over.

278
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:48,078
Why don't you want us
to go to Capri?

279
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:52,576
Because you're an ass.

280
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:02,458
You scare me, Paul.

281
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:06,495
And it's not the first time.

282
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:09,996
So answer
instead ofjust standing there.

283
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:14,786
Why did I marry a 28-year-old typist?

284
00:43:14,958 --> 00:43:18,368
It's true. I'm sorry.

285
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:25,205
So am I.

286
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:42,038
You go to Capri if you want.
I don't feel like it.

287
00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:47,618
Besides, I don't like
that Jeremy Prokosch. I told you.

288
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,921
Why? Did he do something to you?

289
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:55,458
Absolutely not.

290
00:44:08,583 --> 00:44:11,543
Why so thoughtful?

291
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:16,673
Because I'm thinking,
believe it or not.

292
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:21,615
- Surprised?
- No. Why?

293
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:27,245
- An idea.
- Come with me. I won't go alone.

294
00:44:27,416 --> 00:44:31,576
You've been acting funny
since we met that guy.

295
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:37,455
I'm not funny.

296
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:46,828
- Why would you say that?
- Just because.

297
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,920
We were fine this morning.
Now we're fighting over nothing.

298
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:56,963
- What's going on, baby?
- I want to have fun.

299
00:44:57,125 --> 00:44:59,955
Nothing's going on, Paul.

300
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:03,825
I'm afraid I'll get bored there.

301
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,290
I'm not going.

302
00:45:25,916 --> 00:45:29,956
Seen the house being built
across the way?

303
00:45:31,458 --> 00:45:34,368
It's awful.

304
00:45:34,541 --> 00:45:38,001
If you love me, just be quiet.

305
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:50,745
A husband has a right to know
why his wife's sulking.

306
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:57,123
- I'm sure it's about that girl.
- Drop dead!

307
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:18,420
Hello. Good afternoon.

308
00:46:19,416 --> 00:46:22,576
No, Camille isn't here.

309
00:46:23,708 --> 00:46:27,708
I thought you ate in town
and went shopping.

310
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:34,543
She just walked in the door!
Your mother.

311
00:47:17,375 --> 00:47:20,955
I'll call you tomorrow. Ciao.

312
00:47:21,125 --> 00:47:27,495
You're out of your mind!
Why did you tell her I was out?

313
00:47:27,666 --> 00:47:31,456
- I don't know why.
- I know why.

314
00:47:31,625 --> 00:47:38,115
To find out if she had lunch with me
and if I wasn't lying.

315
00:47:38,291 --> 00:47:43,171
- That's it.
- Try that again and I'll divorce you.

316
00:47:44,833 --> 00:47:50,043
- Get up!
- What are you doing?

317
00:47:50,208 --> 00:47:52,958
I'm sleeping on the couch.

318
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:59,285
- When, tonight?
- Every night, starting tonight.

319
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:15,420
Don't be angry. I just can't sleep
with the window open.

320
00:48:15,583 --> 00:48:18,373
We'll close the window.

321
00:48:18,541 --> 00:48:22,621
You always say you can't breathe.
No, we'll sleep apart.

322
00:48:22,791 --> 00:48:27,921
Thousands of couples do it.
They still get along fine.

323
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:31,463
What did l do wrong? Tell me.

324
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:37,418
I'm sorry I said you were out.
Is that it? Forgive me.

325
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:40,963
Let me by.

326
00:48:41,125 --> 00:48:45,865
- Is that why you're in a bad mood?
- Yes, but not anymore.

327
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:52,370
I'll be just fine here.

328
00:48:52,541 --> 00:48:55,711
I reallywonder what I did.

329
00:49:01,625 --> 00:49:04,575
You're so mean all of a sudden.

330
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:08,370
Me? I'm the same as always.

331
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:13,578
You're the one who's changed.

332
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:23,423
Ever since you've been
with movie people.

333
00:49:23,583 --> 00:49:26,623
You used to write crime novels.

334
00:49:26,791 --> 00:49:32,251
We didn't have much money,
but everything was fine.

335
00:49:39,833 --> 00:49:46,003
What's this?
"Partito Comunista ltaliano".

336
00:49:46,166 --> 00:49:50,576
- You never said you joined.
- That was two months ago in Paris.

337
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:56,870
- Give me that.
- Let go! You'll bruise me.

338
00:49:57,041 --> 00:50:00,751
I'm working for you.
This place is notjust for me!

339
00:50:00,916 --> 00:50:05,956
Please, Paul,
I don't want to argue.

340
00:50:14,958 --> 00:50:18,038
I don't want to go to Capri, either.

341
00:50:18,208 --> 00:50:21,458
Why not? Don't be stupid. Go.

342
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:31,248
Paul, come here.

343
00:50:31,416 --> 00:50:33,956
What?

344
00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:36,705
No, I've lost interest.

345
00:50:36,875 --> 00:50:40,915
When Prokosch calls,
tell him l won't talk to him.

346
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:45,076
Paul, come here.

347
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:51,618
Why won't you do the script now?

348
00:50:54,458 --> 00:50:57,578
I'd have done it out of love for you.

349
00:50:59,958 --> 00:51:03,618
But you don't love me anymore.

350
00:51:03,791 --> 00:51:06,581
That's news!

351
00:51:11,666 --> 00:51:15,996
"I had to judge a bottom contest
between three beautiful women.

352
00:51:16,166 --> 00:51:18,956
They chose me as a judge.

353
00:51:19,125 --> 00:51:22,415
They showed me
their dazzling nudity.

354
00:51:22,583 --> 00:51:27,423
The first had a white and gentle
curved back with round dimples.

355
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:32,923
When the second parted her legs,
her snowy skin grew as red as a rose.

356
00:51:33,083 --> 00:51:36,373
The third was as still as a quiet sea.

357
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:42,371
Her delicate skin rippled gently,
shivering involuntarily."

358
00:51:46,458 --> 00:51:52,078
We'll just mortgage the flat
when we run out of money.

359
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:56,960
Something makes you think
I've stopped loving you?

360
00:51:57,125 --> 00:52:00,415
Yes.

361
00:52:00,583 --> 00:52:04,293
What?

362
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:08,041
Everything.

363
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:11,328
But what, for instance?

364
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:20,865
- First tell me if it's true.
- No, you tell me first.

365
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:25,538
What makes me think
you've stopped loving me?

366
00:52:25,708 --> 00:52:28,708
The way you've been talking to me.

367
00:52:29,583 --> 00:52:33,123
You weren't like that this morning.

368
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,670
Nor yesterday.

369
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,960
It's the way you look at me, too.

370
00:52:53,708 --> 00:53:00,168
"The problem, in my opinion,
is in our conception of the world.

371
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:03,503
A positive view or a negative one.

372
00:53:03,666 --> 00:53:07,706
Greek tragedy was negative
in that it made Man

373
00:53:07,875 --> 00:53:11,495
a victim of Fate,
as embodied by the Gods,

374
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:16,246
and abandoned him
to a hopeless destiny."

375
00:53:17,416 --> 00:53:22,786
Why do you say it's the open window?
There's something else.

376
00:53:25,458 --> 00:53:28,328
I think so.

377
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:33,290
"Man can rebel against things
that are bad, false.

378
00:53:33,458 --> 00:53:39,078
We must rebel when we're trapped
by circumstances, conventions.

379
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:43,420
But l don't think
murder is a solution.

380
00:53:43,583 --> 00:53:46,503
Crimes of passion serve no purpose.

381
00:53:46,666 --> 00:53:51,866
I love a woman,
she cheats on me, I kill her.

382
00:53:52,041 --> 00:53:57,081
What's left for me?
I lost her love since she's dead.

383
00:53:57,250 --> 00:54:01,790
If I kill her lover, she hates me,
and I still lose her love.

384
00:54:01,958 --> 00:54:05,618
Killing is never a solution."

385
00:54:06,666 --> 00:54:08,666
Look, Camille...

386
00:54:08,833 --> 00:54:14,753
I give you my word,
I can't sleep with the window open.

387
00:54:14,916 --> 00:54:18,416
I need silence and darkness.

388
00:54:20,541 --> 00:54:23,541
I swear it's true.

389
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:30,830
And you move around too much.
You keep waking me.

390
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,120
I want to sleep alone from now on.

391
00:54:35,541 --> 00:54:38,461
You don't want to make love?

392
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:44,995
Listen to this jerk.

393
00:54:45,166 --> 00:54:48,956
Is that a mocking smile
or a tender smile?

394
00:54:50,666 --> 00:54:53,456
A tender smile.

395
00:54:55,791 --> 00:54:59,961
- So, answer me!
- If it were true, l'd tell you.

396
00:55:00,125 --> 00:55:03,575
A woman can always find
an excuse not to make love.

397
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:09,250
- But you're really a jerk.
- Vulgar language doesn't suit you.

398
00:55:10,208 --> 00:55:12,958
It doesn't suit me?

399
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:17,830
Listen to this...

400
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,120
Asshole. Cunt.

401
00:55:22,291 --> 00:55:24,671
Shit.

402
00:55:25,416 --> 00:55:27,746
Christ almighty.

403
00:55:28,791 --> 00:55:30,921
Craphole.

404
00:55:31,958 --> 00:55:34,998
Son of a bitch.

405
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:37,826
Goddamn.

406
00:55:42,041 --> 00:55:46,581
So, still think
it doesn't suit me?

407
00:56:10,583 --> 00:56:14,373
Why don't you want
to make love anymore?

408
00:56:22,541 --> 00:56:27,621
All right. Let's do it, but fast.

409
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,040
I'd been thinking
Camille could leave me.

410
00:56:34,208 --> 00:56:39,918
It was a possible disaster.
Now the disaster had happened.

411
00:56:40,083 --> 00:56:43,963
We used to live
in a cloud of unawareness,

412
00:56:44,125 --> 00:56:46,825
in delighted complicity.

413
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Things happened with sudden,
wild, enchanted recklessness.

414
00:56:52,166 --> 00:56:58,456
I'd end up in Paul's arms,
hardly aware of what had happened.

415
00:56:58,625 --> 00:57:03,785
This recklessness was now absent
in Camille, and thus in me.

416
00:57:03,958 --> 00:57:08,118
Could I now watch her coldly,
prey to my excited senses,

417
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:11,371
as she could undoubtedly observe me?

418
00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:17,498
I deliberately made that remark
with a secret feeling of revenge.

419
00:57:17,666 --> 00:57:20,786
She seemed aware
that a lie could settle everything.

420
00:57:20,958 --> 00:57:26,668
For a while, on the surface at least.
She was clearly tempted to lie.

421
00:57:26,833 --> 00:57:29,963
But she thought better of it.

422
00:57:30,125 --> 00:57:32,205
Paul hurt me so much.

423
00:57:32,375 --> 00:57:35,705
It was my turn now,
alluding to what I'd seen,

424
00:57:35,875 --> 00:57:38,865
without really being specific.

425
00:57:40,208 --> 00:57:45,248
But I was wrong. She wasn't unfaithful,
or at least not obviously so.

426
00:57:45,416 --> 00:57:49,996
The truth remained concealed.
We needed to dig deeper.

427
00:57:51,625 --> 00:57:57,495
I've noticed that the more we doubt,
the more we cling to a false lucidity,

428
00:57:57,666 --> 00:58:04,286
in the hope of rationalizing
what feelings made murky and obscure.

429
00:58:04,458 --> 00:58:07,038
I thought Camille might leave me.

430
00:58:07,208 --> 00:58:11,748
It was a possible disaster.
Now the disaster had happened.

431
00:58:11,916 --> 00:58:17,956
We used to live in a cloud of
unawareness, in delicious complicity.

432
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:23,710
Don't be like that.

433
00:58:27,083 --> 00:58:31,583
- Don't be like what?
- You know very well.

434
00:58:37,208 --> 00:58:39,918
It's your fault!

435
00:58:48,166 --> 00:58:53,706
You seem to be searching
my expression

436
00:58:53,875 --> 00:58:56,955
to decide the appropriate attitude.

437
00:59:02,875 --> 00:59:07,365
"The private plane awaited
in the blue sky.

438
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:15,750
Rex noticed something about Paula
that he knew already, her face...

439
00:59:15,916 --> 00:59:21,616
Her harmonious face,
now indecisive, seemed contorted.

440
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:28,001
Rex knew this trait of hers,
for it seemed that whenever Paula...

441
00:59:28,166 --> 00:59:32,206
Whenever Paula
had to make a decision...

442
00:59:42,208 --> 00:59:45,418
that went against her nature..."

443
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:51,920
What's got into you?
I love you exactly as before.

444
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:11,538
What would you do
if I stopped loving you?

445
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:16,208
- I already told you.
- I forgot what you said.

446
01:00:16,375 --> 01:00:20,745
I wouldn't do the script
and we'd sell the flat.

447
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:33,665
But l love you.
I find this all so idiotic.

448
01:00:35,291 --> 01:00:40,541
When Prokosch calls,
tell him you'll go to Capri.

449
01:00:53,666 --> 01:00:57,996
- What about you?
- I love you. Don't make me repeat it.

450
01:00:58,166 --> 01:01:01,326
I want to keep the flat.

451
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:04,750
If you don't want to do the script,
don't do it.

452
01:01:04,916 --> 01:01:09,456
If you think l've stopped loving you,
you're wrong.

453
01:01:12,208 --> 01:01:14,788
Kiss me.

454
01:01:43,916 --> 01:01:46,956
We were just talking about you.

455
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:56,328
About your movie.

456
01:01:57,416 --> 01:02:01,786
Yes,The Odyssey.
About that guy who travels.

457
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:08,960
In Capri,
can we go swimming?

458
01:02:13,208 --> 01:02:15,868
I don't know.

459
01:02:19,625 --> 01:02:23,035
Here's Paul. I'll put him on.

460
01:02:29,916 --> 01:02:33,326
Mr. Prokosch? Yes.

461
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,580
No.

462
01:02:53,458 --> 01:02:55,078
We're eating out?

463
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:59,080
I don't feel like
going out for groceries.

464
01:03:04,666 --> 01:03:09,746
Fine. We're to meet Prokosch
and Lang at a cinema.

465
01:03:09,916 --> 01:03:13,866
They want to see a singer
in the stage show. We can eat after.

466
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:17,041
It'll be late if there's a movie first.

467
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:20,788
It might give me some ideas.

468
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:30,040
Why not look for ideas in your head,
instead of stealing them?

469
01:03:30,208 --> 01:03:36,038
- What's got into you?
- Let's get going!

470
01:03:36,208 --> 01:03:41,958
I knew it. Since l said yes
to Prokosch, it's no more tenderness!

471
01:03:42,125 --> 01:03:48,535
Right, no more caresses.
What was the phone call about?

472
01:03:48,708 --> 01:03:52,538
- Our going to Capri.
- What did you say?

473
01:03:52,708 --> 01:03:58,118
- That it was up to you.
- Are you nuts?

474
01:03:58,291 --> 01:04:02,291
You know that it's up to you, not me!

475
01:04:02,458 --> 01:04:06,418
- Then come to Capri.
- No.

476
01:04:06,583 --> 01:04:10,253
Is there something
between you and Prokosch?

477
01:04:10,416 --> 01:04:13,456
You're pathetic.

478
01:04:20,291 --> 01:04:24,921
- Sit down. I have to talk to you.
- What about the cinema?

479
01:04:25,083 --> 01:04:27,833
Camille, I need to talk to you.

480
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:34,213
All right, I'm listening.

481
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:39,245
I need... to talk to you.

482
01:04:43,333 --> 01:04:47,373
Earlier, before the phone rang,

483
01:04:48,666 --> 01:04:54,666
I said I didn't want to take this job
if I couldn't be sure of your love.

484
01:04:56,166 --> 01:05:03,206
You said you loved me
and that I should take it.

485
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:07,123
Yes.

486
01:05:08,166 --> 01:05:10,916
I'm sure you lied.

487
01:05:12,458 --> 01:05:18,748
Why? I don't know.
Out of pity, self-interest...

488
01:05:18,916 --> 01:05:25,826
- What self-interest?
- You holding on to this flat.

489
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,250
How can you know what I think?

490
01:05:29,416 --> 01:05:36,076
In fact, I couldn't care less.
You can sell the flat, I don't care.

491
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:39,540
You said it was better than a hotel.

492
01:05:39,708 --> 01:05:45,748
Not at all.
I said that to make you happy.

493
01:05:45,916 --> 01:05:52,166
That's beside the point.
I want to know why you lied earlier.

494
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:54,713
Who said I lied? Stop it!

495
01:05:54,875 --> 01:05:58,415
You did. You've stopped loving me.

496
01:05:59,458 --> 01:06:02,208
What good will
knowing the truth do you?

497
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:04,995
See? You admit I'm right.

498
01:06:05,166 --> 01:06:09,576
I'm not admitting anything.
Leave me alone.

499
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:15,500
It's true. I don't love you anymore.

500
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:22,331
There's nothing to explain.
I don't love you.

501
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:27,170
Why? Yesterday you still loved me.

502
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:31,373
Yes, very much.

503
01:06:31,541 --> 01:06:35,001
Now it's over.

504
01:06:35,166 --> 01:06:41,916
- There must be a reason.
- Yes, there must be.

505
01:06:42,083 --> 01:06:44,173
What is it?

506
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:49,543
I don't know. All l know is
I don't love you anymore.

507
01:06:50,583 --> 01:06:53,373
Since we were at Prokosch's?

508
01:06:53,541 --> 01:06:58,121
When you saw me pat
Francesca Vanini's bottom?

509
01:07:01,166 --> 01:07:07,036
Let's say it was that.
It's over now. Let's drop the subject.

510
01:07:09,833 --> 01:07:13,293
Something's happened
since this morning.

511
01:07:13,458 --> 01:07:19,418
It changed your mind about me,
and therefore, your love for me.

512
01:07:21,958 --> 01:07:26,578
- You're nuts, but you're clever.
- Then it's true.

513
01:07:32,875 --> 01:07:39,115
I didn't say that.
I said you're clever.

514
01:07:40,375 --> 01:07:44,665
Was it something I said or did today
that you took the wrong way?

515
01:07:44,833 --> 01:07:46,623
Maybe.

516
01:07:46,791 --> 01:07:51,211
Don't talk to me like that!
I won't allow it!

517
01:08:00,125 --> 01:08:02,415
Camille!

518
01:08:09,125 --> 01:08:12,915
I despise you! That's what I feel.

519
01:08:13,083 --> 01:08:16,173
That's why the love's gone.

520
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:20,043
And you disgust me when you touch me.

521
01:08:32,458 --> 01:08:35,668
Wait for me. Don't be so dramatic.

522
01:08:39,958 --> 01:08:44,998
Forget what I said, Paul.
Pretend nothing happened.

523
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:51,120
Good evening.

524
01:09:58,333 --> 01:10:02,583
- Are you going to Capri, too?
- Maybe.

525
01:10:25,541 --> 01:10:28,081
Are you okay?

526
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:34,623
Mr. Prokosch re-read Homer.

527
01:11:39,541 --> 01:11:44,211
He found something
he had long been searching for.

528
01:11:50,666 --> 01:11:56,536
Something as indispensable
to the movies as to real life.

529
01:11:56,708 --> 01:11:58,498
Poetry.

530
01:12:00,875 --> 01:12:04,705
- You remember...
- Oh, yes.

531
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:10,580
They say Ulysses came home
to Penelope,

532
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:14,040
but maybe Ulysses had been
fed up with Penelope.

533
01:12:14,208 --> 01:12:19,618
So he went off to the Trojan war, and
since he didn't feel like going home,

534
01:12:19,791 --> 01:12:22,371
he kept travelling as long as he could.

535
01:12:22,541 --> 01:12:26,291
Do you think it was
an idea of his or...?

536
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:40,420
- Why do you despise me?
- Leave me alone!

537
01:12:55,166 --> 01:12:58,616
Coming to Capri with us, Mr. Lang?

538
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:06,036
"Each morning, to earn my bread
I go to the market where lies are sold

539
01:13:06,916 --> 01:13:10,916
and, full of hope, I line up
alongside the other vendors."

540
01:13:11,083 --> 01:13:14,753
- What's that?
- Hollywood.

541
01:13:14,916 --> 01:13:18,036
From a ballad by poor B.B.

542
01:13:19,416 --> 01:13:22,076
- Bertolt Brecht?
- Yes.

543
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:35,370
Homer's world is a real world.

544
01:13:35,541 --> 01:13:39,001
And the poet belonged to a civilization

545
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:45,746
that grew in harmony,
not in opposition, with nature.

546
01:13:45,916 --> 01:13:48,536
And the beauty of The Odyssey

547
01:13:48,708 --> 01:13:55,288
lies precisely in this belief
in reality as it is.

548
01:13:55,458 --> 01:13:58,748
Thus in reality
as it appears objectively.

549
01:13:58,916 --> 01:14:05,706
Exactly. And in a form
that cannot be broken down.

550
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:10,205
And is what it is.
Take it or leave it.

551
01:14:13,666 --> 01:14:17,286
I shut up because I have nothing to say.

552
01:14:30,458 --> 01:14:35,418
I'm not sure about going to Capri.
Where would we stay?

553
01:14:38,458 --> 01:14:41,868
In Mr. Prokosch's villa.

554
01:14:44,333 --> 01:14:49,083
- With your husband.
- And Mr. Lang too?

555
01:14:53,041 --> 01:14:54,921
That's up to him.

556
01:14:55,083 --> 01:15:00,503
Producers are something
I can easily do without.

557
01:15:00,666 --> 01:15:03,746
- Madam.
- Goodnight.

558
01:15:29,416 --> 01:15:34,116
If you don't want to come,
I'm not forcing you.

559
01:15:34,291 --> 01:15:39,871
It's not you that's forcing me.
It's life.

560
01:16:08,416 --> 01:16:11,456
What are you doing?

561
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,290
- What are you doing?
- Looking.

562
01:16:18,458 --> 01:16:22,288
Don't stay by yourself. Join us.

563
01:16:22,458 --> 01:16:27,168
- What were you talking about?
-The Odyssey.

564
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:32,713
- I agree with Prokosch's theory.
- What theory's that?

565
01:16:32,875 --> 01:16:37,865
That Ulysses loves his wife,
but she doesn't love him.

566
01:16:39,125 --> 01:16:44,955
Do you really think that?
I'm sure you don't.

567
01:16:51,083 --> 01:16:55,873
- Please, you're in the frame.
- Places, everyone!

568
01:17:35,458 --> 01:17:40,998
Are they going to strip off?
Marvellous business this!

569
01:17:41,166 --> 01:17:46,536
You show women in dresses a camera,
and hey presto! They strip off!

570
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:02,668
Come with us, madam,
leave them here to talk.

571
01:18:02,833 --> 01:18:06,003
No, I'll walk back later
with my husband.

572
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:17,210
He says you spend all day
with your husband.

573
01:18:19,625 --> 01:18:22,955
Do you mind if you wife comes with us?

574
01:18:23,125 --> 01:18:28,415
Not at all. Go on, Camille.
Go on.

575
01:18:30,916 --> 01:18:36,286
I don't mind, go on.

576
01:18:36,458 --> 01:18:41,118
I'll walk back with Mr. Lang
to discuss The Odyssey.

577
01:19:15,458 --> 01:19:18,418
The girls are in the water, Mr Lang.

578
01:19:18,583 --> 01:19:21,713
I should have done a scene
at the beginning

579
01:19:21,875 --> 01:19:28,495
in which the gods
discuss man's fate, in general,

580
01:19:28,666 --> 01:19:32,116
and the fate of Ulysses in particular.

581
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,830
A producer
can be a friend to a director.

582
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:17,870
But Prokosch isn't a real producer.
He's a dictator.

583
01:20:18,041 --> 01:20:23,421
I think it's stupid to change
the character of Ulysses.

584
01:20:23,583 --> 01:20:27,253
He's not a modern-day neurotic,

585
01:20:27,416 --> 01:20:33,116
but a simple, clever and robust man.

586
01:20:33,291 --> 01:20:36,251
I find his idea interesting.

587
01:20:36,416 --> 01:20:39,536
It takes Ulysses
ten years to return home

588
01:20:39,708 --> 01:20:43,538
because he doesn't really
want to return. It's logical.

589
01:20:43,708 --> 01:20:49,788
It's logical, and the illogical
borrows from the logical.

590
01:20:49,958 --> 01:20:54,458
Your Corneille said it
in his preface to Suréna.

591
01:20:54,625 --> 01:20:59,285
Ulysses doesn't rush home to Ithaca

592
01:20:59,458 --> 01:21:03,368
because he was unhappy
with Penelope,

593
01:21:03,541 --> 01:21:08,121
but the trouble started
before he went off to war.

594
01:21:14,208 --> 01:21:17,668
He never would've left
if he'd been happy.

595
01:21:17,833 --> 01:21:21,333
The Trojan war was his excuse
to get away from her.

596
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:25,500
But he killed her suitors, didn't he?

597
01:21:25,666 --> 01:21:29,956
That can be justified
by the fact that, at first,

598
01:21:30,125 --> 01:21:34,325
Ulysses had told Penelope
to accept their gifts.

599
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:38,330
He didn't see the suitors
as serious rivals,

600
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:42,290
and didn't want to cause a scandal
by throwing them out.

601
01:21:42,458 --> 01:21:48,998
Knowing Penelope to be faithful,
he told her to be nice to the suitors.

602
01:21:55,833 --> 01:22:02,463
I think that's when Penelope,
who is a simple woman at heart,

603
01:22:03,625 --> 01:22:06,745
began to despise him.

604
01:22:06,916 --> 01:22:11,916
She found she'd stopped loving
Ulysses because of his behaviour,

605
01:22:12,083 --> 01:22:14,543
and she told him so.

606
01:22:14,708 --> 01:22:19,208
Ulysses then realized too late
he'd lost Penelope's love

607
01:22:19,375 --> 01:22:23,205
because he'd been overly cautious.

608
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:29,460
The only way to win her back
was to murder the suitors.

609
01:22:29,625 --> 01:22:33,075
Death is no resolution.

610
01:24:07,041 --> 01:24:09,121
Camille!

611
01:25:17,416 --> 01:25:21,496
- What a lovely yellow.
- Thanks.

612
01:25:23,833 --> 01:25:26,623
I found this on the boat.

613
01:25:26,791 --> 01:25:30,501
Children shouldn't play with firearms.

614
01:26:18,291 --> 01:26:20,371
Drink?

615
01:26:20,541 --> 01:26:24,581
I was there, outside. Nothing.

616
01:26:58,666 --> 01:27:02,416
I decided not to write
the script you asked me.

617
01:27:05,083 --> 01:27:07,713
Why?

618
01:27:07,875 --> 01:27:11,115
Can l be frank?

619
01:27:15,125 --> 01:27:17,745
Of course.

620
01:27:21,041 --> 01:27:26,621
I'm a playwright.
Not a screenwriter.

621
01:27:31,958 --> 01:27:37,498
Even if it's a fine script...
I'm only doing it for the money!

622
01:27:43,958 --> 01:27:47,788
That's why I'm in a bad mood.

623
01:27:50,333 --> 01:27:55,423
We all have an ideal.
Mine's writing plays. l can't. Why?

624
01:27:57,583 --> 01:28:02,713
In today's world,
we have to accept what others want.

625
01:28:04,875 --> 01:28:07,825
Why does money matter so much
in what we do,

626
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,960
in what we are, in what we become?

627
01:28:12,666 --> 01:28:16,326
Even in our relationships
with those we love.

628
01:28:25,875 --> 01:28:28,665
He is right.

629
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,960
We either do Homer's Odyssey
or we do nothing!

630
01:28:39,708 --> 01:28:43,708
Mr. Prokosch already said it,
you're wrong.

631
01:28:43,875 --> 01:28:46,995
You aspire to a world like Homer's.

632
01:28:47,166 --> 01:28:50,826
You want it to exist,
but unfortunately it doesn't.

633
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,120
Why doesn't it?

634
01:29:01,041 --> 01:29:03,961
You may be right,

635
01:29:04,125 --> 01:29:09,955
but when it comes to making movies,
dreams aren't enough.

636
01:29:16,833 --> 01:29:19,583
When do we eat?

637
01:29:22,916 --> 01:29:27,706
- In an hour.
- Right. I'm going for a walk.

638
01:29:36,625 --> 01:29:39,075
Mr. Prokosch wants to speak with you.

639
01:29:44,708 --> 01:29:49,998
- Is that an order or a request?
- A request.

640
01:29:56,416 --> 01:29:59,206
One must suffer.

641
01:30:01,208 --> 01:30:03,828
That's for sure.

642
01:30:15,416 --> 01:30:17,616
Camille!

643
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:06,788
It's me, Paul.

644
01:31:12,791 --> 01:31:17,921
Looking at you just now,
felt like the first time l'd seen you.

645
01:31:29,958 --> 01:31:35,288
- Mind if I stay?
- Stay if you like.

646
01:31:55,083 --> 01:31:58,213
Why didn't you speak up earlier?

647
01:31:58,375 --> 01:32:02,535
I don't get you! You always said
you loved that script.

648
01:32:02,708 --> 01:32:08,668
Now you tell the producer it's for the
money, that your ideal is the theatre.

649
01:32:09,833 --> 01:32:14,713
He's no fool.
Next time, he won't be asking you.

650
01:32:14,875 --> 01:32:19,535
How can you not understand
something so simple?

651
01:32:21,625 --> 01:32:26,285
- I bet you'll do it anyway.
- No.

652
01:32:26,458 --> 01:32:31,368
Yes, you'll see. l know you.

653
01:32:33,583 --> 01:32:35,673
I know you.

654
01:32:35,833 --> 01:32:40,713
If I do it, it's for you.
To pay for the flat.

655
01:32:40,875 --> 01:32:44,665
I'll let you decide
whether I do the script or not.

656
01:32:44,833 --> 01:32:48,503
If you say no, we'll leave.

657
01:32:48,666 --> 01:32:52,996
- You're so cunning!
- Not at all. Why?

658
01:32:53,166 --> 01:32:58,916
- If you regret it, you can blame me.
- Not at all! I'm asking you to decide.

659
01:32:59,083 --> 01:33:01,673
You want me to tell you what to do?

660
01:33:01,833 --> 01:33:05,123
- Yes.
- Then do the script!

661
01:33:05,291 --> 01:33:09,211
You signed a contract,
and you're boring me.

662
01:33:12,083 --> 01:33:16,673
- I saw him kiss you earlier.
- I know you did.

663
01:33:19,958 --> 01:33:24,788
- Why don't you love me anymore?
- That's life.

664
01:33:25,916 --> 01:33:29,576
Why do you despise me?

665
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:34,040
I'll never tell you,
not even if I were dying.

666
01:33:38,791 --> 01:33:43,791
- Tell me or I'll hurt you.
- Why hurt me more?

667
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,040
I have to know why you despise me.

668
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:55,578
It's crazy! I don't see why
you expect me to accept, anyway.

669
01:33:55,750 --> 01:34:00,080
We need the money for the flat.
I don't want to go back to typing.

670
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:06,000
I can't accept that after what happened.
Obviously you do despise me.

671
01:34:22,625 --> 01:34:26,785
You knew we kissed and you were
still ready to change your mind.

672
01:34:26,958 --> 01:34:33,038
I turned the job down for you.
So you'd change your mind about me.

673
01:34:33,208 --> 01:34:37,868
Don't touch me.
I don't love you anymore.

674
01:34:38,041 --> 01:34:42,041
There's no way
I'll ever love you again.

675
01:34:42,208 --> 01:34:45,708
Even if I turn it down,
you'll despise me?

676
01:34:45,875 --> 01:34:51,615
- Yes, I will.
- Why? There must be a reason.

677
01:34:51,791 --> 01:34:57,291
- You're the reason.
- What do you mean, me?

678
01:34:57,458 --> 01:35:00,748
I don't know. You're not a man.

679
01:35:01,791 --> 01:35:07,421
Anyhow, it's too late.
I've changed my mind about you.

680
01:35:08,875 --> 01:35:14,165
I know why you despise me.
The other day, when I took a taxi,

681
01:35:14,333 --> 01:35:19,213
you thought I wanted you
to go in his car with him.

682
01:35:20,708 --> 01:35:24,328
And again on the boat earlier.
Don't be stupid!

683
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:26,790
I have faults, but that's not one.

684
01:35:26,958 --> 01:35:32,958
I'll never forgive you.
I loved you so much.

685
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:42,210
Now it's impossible. I hate you
because you can't make me feel.

686
01:35:42,375 --> 01:35:45,495
I can! You're almost in tears.

687
01:35:57,791 --> 01:36:01,331
We're leaving! We'll pack up and go.

688
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:05,960
I'm staying. You go if you like.

689
01:36:06,125 --> 01:36:09,165
Come on, Camille!

690
01:36:10,625 --> 01:36:14,075
- No.
- Then l'm staying, too.

691
01:36:14,250 --> 01:36:20,370
- But Prokosch will throw us out.
- Don't start again.

692
01:37:01,416 --> 01:37:06,286
Dear Paul, I found your revolver
and took the bullets out.

693
01:37:06,458 --> 01:37:09,868
If you won't leave, I will.

694
01:37:10,041 --> 01:37:15,461
Jeremy Prokosch has to return to Rome,
so I'll get a lift with him.

695
01:37:15,625 --> 01:37:19,615
Then I'll probably move
into a hotel alone.

696
01:37:19,791 --> 01:37:23,921
Take care. Farewell. Camille.

697
01:38:02,625 --> 01:38:06,365
What are you going to do in Rome?

698
01:38:08,333 --> 01:38:11,123
Typist.

699
01:38:16,291 --> 01:38:19,041
Me? No.

700
01:38:19,958 --> 01:38:22,538
Typist.

701
01:38:46,625 --> 01:38:51,785
What... do you think... of me?

702
01:38:52,875 --> 01:38:57,165
Get into your Alfa, Romeo.
We'll see about that later.

703
01:38:57,333 --> 01:39:02,333
TAKE CARE

704
01:39:08,791 --> 01:39:13,461
FAREWELL

705
01:40:11,416 --> 01:40:15,036
Nathalie,
I'm leaving for Rome tonight.

706
01:40:15,208 --> 01:40:18,248
Good-bye, then.

707
01:40:59,458 --> 01:41:03,748
Mr. Lang,
I've come to say good-bye.

708
01:41:03,916 --> 01:41:07,286
Good-bye. What will you do?

709
01:41:07,458 --> 01:41:12,168
Go back to Rome, finish my play.

710
01:41:13,291 --> 01:41:16,251
- And you?
- I'll finish the film.

711
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:20,536
One should always finish
what one starts.

712
01:41:20,708 --> 01:41:23,538
What shot are you doing?

713
01:41:23,708 --> 01:41:28,578
Ulysses' gaze when he first sees
his homeland again.

714
01:41:30,083 --> 01:41:32,213
Ithaca.

715
01:41:33,916 --> 01:41:38,326
- Good-bye, Mr. Lang.
- Bye. l hope we'll meet again.

716
01:41:42,041 --> 01:41:44,671
We're ready, Mr. Lang.

717
01:41:44,833 --> 01:41:47,923
Quiet on the set!

718
01:41:49,541 --> 01:41:52,421
Camera!

719
01:42:44,666 --> 01:42:47,746
Silence!
