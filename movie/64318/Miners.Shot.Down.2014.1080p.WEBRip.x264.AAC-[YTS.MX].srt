00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,439
Our journey just to call

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:26,440
out Well you didn't follow the instruction we
did anybody should go as impulsive or tool

5
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:28,980
It's the 16th of August 2012 outside the
London platinum mine America in South Africa

6
00:01:29,554 --> 00:01:37,554
a 112 striking miners are shot down by police
34 die like many other South Africans.

7
00:01:38,915 --> 00:01:46,915
The shooting shook me
to the core Events like

8
00:01:48,889 --> 00:01:52,908
this took me back to the massacres
of apartheid sharp filled

9
00:01:52,909 --> 00:02:00,909
1960 sweater 1976 killings like
these led South Africans to support

10
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,188
Nelson Mandela and the struggle for

11
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:11,569
freedom but today these miners are being
shot at by a new government to ensure that

12
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:16,879
it's business as usual we could
see that lives were now being

13
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:24,569
sacrificed for money and the young democracy
we had so much hope for was under threat

14
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,918
This is not a day.

15
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:44,919
Talk pushing play it is a day for us
to mourn together as a nation it is

16
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:55,300
also a day to start rebuilding and
healing the zaps the only nice to

17
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:04,840
advance a situation such as police members had
to employ force to protect themselves from

18
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:14,610
the charging port Is
there time for time for

19
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,744
the sin and death moment we'll

Africans watch in a state of shock.

22
00:03:34,804 --> 00:03:37,803
Half the police being
honest in their account.

23
00:03:37,804 --> 00:03:42,438
No they have not the big question remains.

24
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:46,638
Who sanctioned deobda to use
live ammunition against

25
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:54,639
the strikers My name is
Tony inside in February.

26

They reach a sub paying for the ceiling the

Parliament and the need for
us to add to this port

33
00:04:54,475 --> 00:05:00,149

A crowd of rock jewelers meet a march to

the Longman Management Office they
believe the official majority unions

the National Union of Mineworkers
are in the pockets of

51
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,739
management and so they've
decided to take matters into

52
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:53,643
their own hands they are joined by workers
from a competing Union Scotland and England.

pay of rock drillers is

5 thousand South African wrong the equivalent
of 500 Euros dollars this condemns

83
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,179
them to poverty that he say

84
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,019
mining companies like Longmen view

85
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,319
higher wages as the biggest
threat to the continued health of

86
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:59,320
the business Longmen is a British company

87
00:11:01,355 --> 00:11:07,024
which started drilling for platinum in
South Africa 30 years ago it employs

88
00:11:07,025 --> 00:11:10,098
28 thousand people exporting

89
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:15,690
the world's most precious metal out
of the country And around the globe.

90
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:22,458
The company has spent large sums of money
on a massive program of expansion.

91
00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:25,488
Leaving it financially vulnerable.

92
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:30,109
The prospect of a long strike
was the last thing they wanted.

93
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:37,984
We experienced a group of workers
who studied matching from

94
00:11:37,985 --> 00:11:41,748
the Warner Pop area to us
displays which we call

95
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:46,894
LPD These are the people who defined
mining if they don't drill.

96
00:11:46,895 --> 00:11:51,109
There's no mining. So if they are
not that web it becomes obvious.

97
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,369
They matched until the four-way
junction which is a profitability year

98
00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:00,768
And at that point obviously that's
when the security engaged them and at

99
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:03,859
no point did this group of employees

100
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:08,734
demonstrate they had anything to
present a couple of months previously

101
00:12:08,735 --> 00:12:10,158
London admit directly with

102
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:14,868
that same struck committee to discuss the
grievances yet now they wouldn't talk to them

103
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:16,679
why

104
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,758
the

105
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,383
story of the Americana massacre.

106
00:12:28,384 --> 00:12:30,273
Would be incomplete.

107
00:12:30,274 --> 00:12:33,048
Without a close look at the involvement of

108
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:40,039
civil ram opposer I had watched him with
admiration He built the largest trade union

109
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,719
the country had ever seen

110
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,888
the National Union of
Mineworkers under serums

111
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:50,193
leadership Nome Saw the miners
join the fight against apartheid.

112
00:12:50,194 --> 00:12:55,920
And I took my place marching
side-by-side behind their banner.

113
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,939
It must be remembered that it was

114
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:04,533
the mining industry and specifically
the Chamber of mine which pioneered

115
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,504
the most oppressive features of

116
00:13:07,505 --> 00:13:08,659
apartheid South

117
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,230
Africa

118
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,708
Mine workers

119
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:25,789
have always had to put up with harsh
living and working conditions.

120
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:29,344
So Rama posa was determined to change this.

121
00:13:29,345 --> 00:13:32,538
Under his leadership workers were led into

122
00:13:32,539 --> 00:13:36,454
mass strikes and direct confrontation
with the white mine owners.

123
00:13:36,455 --> 00:13:40,878
He was for me a vital and
important person in the birth of

124
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:47,539
the new South Africa there's no such thing
as a liberal bourgeois they're all the same.

125
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,859
They use fascist levels to destroy workers

126
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:59,029
lives He soon became

127
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:02,689
a leading member of the African
National Congress and from

128
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:07,399
this position joined the Black
economic elite ram opposed.

129
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:12,783
Who once or South Africa's working class
as a force to bringing about change.

130
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:18,784
Now found himself on the other side of
the table at the time as the massacre.

131
00:14:18,785 --> 00:14:21,133
He was a board member of long mainland.

132
00:14:21,134 --> 00:14:25,819
We've gone through our waves of
starts and we always have strikes.

133
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:31,398
Because we have such a robust
democratic system that allows

134
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:38,013
workers to express themselves and
people should never be alarmed.

135
00:14:38,014 --> 00:14:42,428
This is the South African
way And we need to accept

136
00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:48,369
that workers will voice
their dissatisfaction.

137
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,253
Through withdrawing their labour.

138
00:14:52,254 --> 00:14:55,508
What we are against is that.

139
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:58,899
Quite a number of those strikes
have tended to ten violent.

140
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:05,960
That is one behavior pattern that
we need to get out of our system

141
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,129
Ironically the National Union of
Mineworkers num the powerful union which

142
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:33,694
saw Arama pose a one-slide was still
the majority Union inside their minds.

143
00:15:33,695 --> 00:15:37,818
But in the lead up to the long range
strike gnome head refuse to address

144
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:42,169
the low wages of their members and
when London management talked to

145
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,808
workers that they would only negotiate says

146
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:49,699
the majority union the workers
decided to go back to nums office

147
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:54,739
about three pairs on to workers strike
has marched down to the mem offers

148
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,408
the people who are in the new
officers and there are probably

149
00:15:57,409 --> 00:16:00,513
about 30 Branch officials and shops years.

150
00:16:00,514 --> 00:16:03,168
They'd been advised by the
London security that the march

151
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:05,959
was solids way and if they didn't want
to meet them arch And they should

152
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,098

the 30 people who were there and they
handle their pingers and spears.

160

00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:04,968
Into an answer verbally Roku

172
00:18:04,969 --> 00:18:07,639
narrow eikonal upper-income
port in ten years when

173
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,189
the sabia band and I move gear hazamah.

174
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,908
Awesome. Now I've got an amateur

175
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:21,909
toggling the National Union of Mineworkers

176
00:18:22,865 --> 00:18:28,653
denies any of their members attack workers
and insist that they branch leadership.

177
00:18:28,654 --> 00:18:31,114
We're acting in self-defense.

178
00:18:31,115 --> 00:18:36,604
None would not encouraged
in is sort of that

179
00:18:36,605 --> 00:18:41,598
Patnam watch Understand if
it's people believed that they

180
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,049
are under threat to their lives
and our office and outlet

181
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:49,219
that did they we'll add this pop off the
moment disabled taiga standards have

182
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,459
said that as an Ngram would
believe that those people

183
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,729
in that circumstances found
themselves and we'll end

184
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,844
with one condemn what they did
in many respects that was

185
00:18:59,845 --> 00:19:05,194
a complete turning point because
up until that point That beam.

186
00:19:05,195 --> 00:19:08,313
Very little violence I'm not
saying there wasn't any violence.

187
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:11,029
People said was a bit of intimidation
I really don't know about

188
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:14,084
it but no one was being killed.

189
00:19:14,085 --> 00:19:17,673
So my leg the leg Knowsalot spill
that Divina food in the side.

190
00:19:17,674 --> 00:19:21,574
Hit a grounding pill.

191
00:19:21,575 --> 00:19:24,049
So a planning Dawn.

192
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:27,288
Is bad Georgia Linda and
pillars now palisade

193
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:31,698
Tom silicone Masada and dab
it in jabayo and I got

194
00:19:31,699 --> 00:19:39,699
these giga gnomon mom
banned 11 to further draw.

195
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:42,604
Every time the miners gather

196
00:19:42,605 --> 00:19:48,274
the Longmen security guard keeps a
keen eye on them After the shootings.

197
00:19:48,275 --> 00:19:56,275
Of two people allegedly from Korea area
such ICN is fairly comma this state

198
00:19:58,505 --> 00:20:02,959
no direct greatest
maturity as a reaction to

199
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,179
numb shooting at their own members the
conflict grows Longmen rock tutors from

200
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:12,858
the nearby carry shaft join the
strike in numbers they belong

201
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:17,883
to the competing union the association
of construction and mine workers union.

202
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,529
I'm 6'2

203
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,823
I'm cuz leader

204
00:20:29,824 --> 00:20:34,969
Joseph more tundra like grammar posa
20 years before him is fighting

205
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:40,879
the system and believes num has become far
too close to mine management and government.

206
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,980
He soon becomes an important player
in the unfolding events at maricon

207
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,404
What you've got is liberates

208
00:20:53,405 --> 00:20:58,548
the only thing that we'd better feedback
is to change it Administration which was

209
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:03,064
run by the White cannot then
is our trend h. Now what did

210
00:21:03,065 --> 00:21:10,349
Moses Bono who just says really taught
I will almost seem values is given

211
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:40,218
Run the 12th they decide that
they're going to go back to the

212
00:21:40,219 --> 00:21:46,654
amorphous is this time I think that there
are inferior and they take their own.

213
00:21:46,655 --> 00:21:52,879
Course of action and they all
stopped rarely by London.

214
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,539
Security guards and not much is known of

215
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:01,069
what happened on that day I
mean there is a suggestion that

216
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:05,269
these guards who have to say or poorly

217
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:10,878
paid ordinary black working class
people who were sent out to confront.

218
00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:15,163
On behalf all this multinational
firm of exploiters

219
00:22:15,164 --> 00:22:21,468
The the demonstration that's coming
to them but whatever happened

220
00:22:21,469 --> 00:22:28,728
to girls were killed and one of
them in particular was bound to

221
00:22:28,729 --> 00:22:30,270
a cinder

222
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,319
Cyril ram

223
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,373
oppose it was close to Nelson Mandela.

224
00:23:04,374 --> 00:23:07,463
We thought he was succeeded
Mandela presidency.

225
00:23:07,464 --> 00:23:09,009
After the massacre.

226
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:14,709
I was hoping to have an honest discussion
about what really took place in America but

227
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,348
he quickly made it clear
that he would speak only in

228
00:23:17,349 --> 00:23:20,813
January terms until appearing
before the Commission.

229
00:23:20,814 --> 00:23:26,858
We were the first country
to have a wave of strikes.

230
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:29,153
Let's just get that clear.

231
00:23:29,154 --> 00:23:37,044
Many countries both middle-income countries
low income countries and high income

232
00:23:37,045 --> 00:23:39,518
countries have been through waves of

233
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:45,899
strife And many of those strikes in some
countries have even toppled governments.

234
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:05,254
You'd. It wasn't as if the
16th was a day are slated

235
00:24:05,255 --> 00:24:09,814
from context you have to look back
to the Monday before that Thursday.

236
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:13,144
When a group of a 150 to 200 miners

237
00:24:13,145 --> 00:24:17,659
went from that copy to Korea
three mind with the herd.

238
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,808
There were still some miners working
in they want to tell them to

239
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:23,928
down tools Intimidation solidarity you can

240
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:26,974
call it what you want
there were turned back

241
00:24:26,975 --> 00:24:30,628
by the security to the mind we
told them go back with that treat.

242
00:24:30,629 --> 00:24:36,318
There went back with that Truett
halfway back to that copy.

243
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:38,538
They were met by a cordon of

244
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:45,318
police and usually led

245
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:49,559
by the Deputy Commissioner for
the Northwest general impending

246
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:09,119
He says Is into Nr is paired to Azi yet

247
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:16,884
doing my yeah yeah yeah pneumonia.

248
00:25:16,885 --> 00:25:19,160
I mean you guys are looses.

249
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:28,640
Then allowed us right now how can

250
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:35,868
I do that I don't like that and

251
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:43,869
I'm not gonna do that

252
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:13,638
But as important.

253
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:21,639
Can you then begin to
understand the standpoint of

254
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:28,239
those employees they say by
the way we have no issue with

255
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,264
you as the police Now
that's very fundamental.

256
00:26:34,265 --> 00:26:39,918
Is like the one to remind
everybody including the police

257
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:47,919
that in a democracy where cosmic
negotiate with the employers.

258
00:26:48,035 --> 00:26:56,035
The police should not be this shield between
employees rights and employers applications

259
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,689
or one that's not right

260
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:19,279
The very interesting part about it is when
the negotiations between Jeran timber.

261
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,559
In some other way can lead us.

262
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,748
Including funny nope.

263
00:27:23,749 --> 00:27:26,659
The so-called man in the clinic blanket.

264
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:33,108
Members. Now when it is clear that the
employees have put their position.

265
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:36,484
Look. Few oriented disarmament.
That's okay.

266
00:27:36,485 --> 00:27:41,219
But you need to as caught us
for a year to the mountain

267
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:05,370
And Chandra and pamby
reaches a stage where it

268
00:28:08,329 --> 00:28:10,729
says Now let me get to state i you

269
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,869
saying if we escort to to the mountain
when you get there you'll end

270
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:21,559
over the weapons to us and they
say yes and at that point he gets

271
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:29,560
a telephone cord but he said in
effect when one looks at that clip.

272
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:37,599
These attitude isn't radical before and
after that phone call Hi I'm dose.

273
00:28:39,535 --> 00:28:47,535
We afford now in conto we are again
Diane demand myrtle that Tony in

274
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:55,388
Canto Yeah

275
00:28:55,389 --> 00:29:02,099
I think I think

276
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:25,200
they go into their soul and
they just get up and go

277
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,114
And again to either credit.

278
00:29:46,115 --> 00:29:50,479
At that point gentle
impairment doesn't say should

279
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:58,480
this baggers here allows them pay much
in the simply provide a quarter note

280
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:23,838
This group of miners or walking
slowly and deliberately.

281
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:28,920
From the video footage you see that
don't seem to pose any threat.

282
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:36,574
Suddenly you see tear gas being fired
Berlin wireless I'm shots fired.

283
00:30:36,575 --> 00:30:41,374
They get ignored that just keep
going and there's a line of police

284
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:47,549
jogging alongside them on the one side
this armored vehicles keeps going.

285
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:59,280
Another body of shots and
tear gas Cricket break.

286
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:03,619
So this is a PBS.

287
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:09,763
Learning to run less than the
agreement from what we see

288
00:31:09,764 --> 00:31:12,949
the peoples that are running around

289
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:18,138
after the stamp lemmings here had been
thrown in exploded it's only then

290
00:31:18,139 --> 00:31:23,284
that people start running around
connectedness and none of the commanders.

291
00:31:23,285 --> 00:31:25,158
At admit to having given

292
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:29,508
instruction in fact somebody who
told us alleged that you are given

293
00:31:29,509 --> 00:31:32,898
the instruction and you are
quite emphatic that was not

294
00:31:32,899 --> 00:31:37,864
true but none of the commanders gave
the order Coons instructions to

295
00:31:37,865 --> 00:31:41,559
the information that you have
So I don't think he's really

296
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,968
puzzling and in that chaos three minus are

297
00:31:45,969 --> 00:31:49,493
killed one of whom seems to have been

298
00:31:49,494 --> 00:31:55,129
stabbed to death and it's unclear who
caused their death in what circumstances.

299
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:02,510
Also two cops get quota and get killed

300
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:27,618
To strike us were not killed at the
scene to strikers were killed.

301
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:32,598
Perhaps 300 meters another
800 meters from that scene.

302
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:38,178
My interpretation is that these
two strikers were fleeing

303
00:32:38,179 --> 00:32:43,924
and running away from the scene and
were pursued by police officers.

304
00:32:43,925 --> 00:32:47,928
One in particular I believe
that when he was perhaps

305
00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:51,829
800 meters away from the scene
and was running through a river

306
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:55,429
and up the bank on the other
side I believe he was

307
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:59,658
targeted by a police
officer and was shot and

308
00:32:59,659 --> 00:33:03,169
I described that as being an execution
people took cell phone pictures of

309
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:08,028
the The Police and the circulated
through all police circles.

310
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:12,994
Every single province got these
police to policemen had been killed.

311
00:33:12,995 --> 00:33:16,579
Now to be realistic we know that cops have

312
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,608
a kind of iron clad drill you

313
00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:23,448
take us out we're going to take you out you
didn't get away with killing policemen.

314
00:33:23,449 --> 00:33:27,570
That's police forces
across the world actually

315
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:00,109
It's two days before the massacre.

316
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:04,429
Already a total of nine
people have been killed with

317
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:09,139
the latest and num official
being marked by a cow's skull.

318
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:14,658
The sign of a traitor conflict
between the strikers and gnome goes

319
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:20,269
from bad to worse it what it does
more as to what is the motif.

320
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:24,528
Because no organization worth
its salt can embark on on on

321
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:28,769
on on this barbaric way of raising
issues And we believe that the partners

322
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:36,049
know that NUM will never be involved in
this kind of barbaric way of dealing with

323
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:39,708
users non-man begins its
campaign of pinning

324
00:34:39,709 --> 00:34:43,849
responsibility for the violence
on the striking miners.

325
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,438
We didn't.

326
00:34:45,439 --> 00:34:49,698
Not anticipate this type of
violence and I don't think

327
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:51,919
any organization in this country could have

328
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,770
anticipated this type of violence
because it's not normal.

329
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:01,218
So that's why we looking and searching
and using the police particularly the

330
00:35:01,219 --> 00:35:06,569
crime intelligence to understand
the root cause of the situation

331
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:37,204
Running casseroles joined the fight
against apartheid in the 19 sixties.

332
00:35:37,205 --> 00:35:39,679
Following this short film massacre.

333
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,704
He sat on the National Executive
Committee of the ANC for 20 years

334
00:35:44,705 --> 00:35:50,074
and was considered by the white minority regime
as one of their most dangerous opponents.

335
00:35:50,075 --> 00:35:55,863
Why the use Police force
onto the teeth against

336
00:35:55,864 --> 00:36:02,629
2-3 thousand miners who were not
occupying mining property or territory.

337
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:06,274
Were not occupying any
strategic point we're not

338
00:36:06,275 --> 00:36:10,639
blocking the national
highway or any minor road.

339
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,424
They were seated at a distance from

340
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:20,913
any any key point to I please
visibility and presence law remained.

341
00:36:20,914 --> 00:36:26,460
Until the situation is completely
stable and currently we are seeing.

342
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:34,879
Mind work as part of our
phased approach In terms

343
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,238
of discussing and negotiating with

344
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:42,389
the protesters and that's the process
that you're busy with after statuary.

345
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,999
I'm not at all sure why they brought
in a hostage negotiator to try and

346
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,709
negotiate with 3 thousand
strike as it does seem Bizarre.

347
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:14,568
Particularly as the strike is who always
said We want to negotiate but we want to

348
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:20,370
negotiate with management kinda.

349
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:29,253
Yeah Communist gardener but
don't tell them please.

350
00:37:29,254 --> 00:37:33,048
Any weapons weapons.

351
00:37:33,049 --> 00:37:38,238
It's not for us and nothing
would happen to them they

352
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:43,714
National Police Commissioner ported
Longman to produce photographs

353
00:37:43,715 --> 00:37:48,168
of the demonstrators she
then ordered London to

354
00:37:48,169 --> 00:37:53,348
identify the ring leaders
I need to indicate that

355
00:37:53,349 --> 00:38:00,323
a management styles and

356
00:38:00,324 --> 00:38:05,753
also continue to assist me to
identify them from their fortunes.

357
00:38:05,754 --> 00:38:10,853
But what is clear is not the person
that they're would've identified.

358
00:38:10,854 --> 00:38:14,424
Because he was the main
negotiator is Mr. loci.

359
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,374
The man in the green blanket.

360
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:22,519
What we know about Muslim Inaki is that
he has 14 bullet holes in him he is dead

361
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:42,619
Then I will stop at the stop stopping for

362
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:48,858
leaders is asking is asking can you
turn the motor off so we can talk.

363
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:55,789
Related to weight cannot to
be heard over the noise of

364
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:59,149
the running engine strike
lead a man boast climbs onto

365
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:03,780
the armored vehicle to talk to
the police hostage negotiation.

366
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:08,220
Thank him. Thank him

367
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:18,270
quite a lot And I'm going to

368
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:35,340
talk about what happened at

369
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:46,260
the same time and I went I went
up and going and minus does not

370
00:39:48,425 --> 00:39:53,250
produce having studied
whether this particular

371
00:39:54,360 --> 00:40:00,588
result But Longmen continued to

372
00:40:00,589 --> 00:40:03,469
refuse to meet the strikers what

373
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:06,919
happened next was only discovered
a year into the commission.

374
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,238
When the police were ordered to
hand over files that they had

375
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:17,988
hidden it is a transcript of a conversation
that took place two days before the massacre.

376
00:40:17,989 --> 00:40:22,759
Between an executive of Longmen and the
provincial Commissioner of Police.

377
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:29,013
It reveals the state and Longmen putting their
heads together on how to break the strike.

378
00:40:29,014 --> 00:40:35,388
Before it spread to other minds we need to act
such that we kill this thing immediately.

379
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:38,749
Yes Tomorrow we have to move in if

380
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:42,139
today we do not find cooperation
in these people we need to

381
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,258
move in such that we can
it so I agree with you

382
00:40:45,259 --> 00:40:49,144
Commissioner if it can arrest these
people because the longer it goes.

383
00:40:49,145 --> 00:40:52,489
It is giving all the other
opportunities to comment and seize

384
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:56,149
the opportunity and then it
gets out of control that is

385
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:59,269
it so I think yes that tomorrow be

386
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:03,619
the D-Day where we issue the ultimatum
and say If you do not show up for work.

387
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,849
Sorry that is it

388
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:32,849
You may go to

389
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:49,600
this other node along

390
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,489
this robot

391
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,753
Alright

democratic Good morning to you Good monitor

401
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,619
By Joseph my tune joy he is

00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:34,293
the president of unquote if a good
monitor units to match withdrew.

403
00:42:34,294 --> 00:42:40,223
Their machine to to cada Ada Stevia
guys came out of the offices of

404
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:45,574
NUM fiat adult tickets There was no
firing at any point due on Friday.

405
00:42:45,575 --> 00:42:50,088
This feather confirms my view that
unquote behind them much the fact that

406
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:54,964
they one way of achieving that is if the
leaders of the two polygons the unions.

407
00:42:54,965 --> 00:42:58,068
Come together go there
publicly together and say okay

408
00:42:58,069 --> 00:43:01,263
for now let's go back to
work we early on is that

409
00:43:01,264 --> 00:43:07,128
our outside ready to take us there ever
too difficult unless I cyclical times

410
00:43:07,129 --> 00:43:09,214
I'm thankful any Muslim corner yes

411
00:43:09,215 --> 00:43:13,323
Kalanick our position as
management is as follows we agree.

412
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:14,943
People must be designed.

413
00:43:14,944 --> 00:43:21,378
We went to meet the structures of the unions
to discuss any grievance or consent in

414
00:43:21,379 --> 00:43:24,529
the most civilized manner
Without pandas and without

415
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:28,024
cars we can do it now we can
do it as soon as possible.

416
00:43:28,025 --> 00:43:31,999
Ready let's go then let's hope that's
bulges at Montana and agreement.

417
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,738
During a radio interview the leaders of
the trade unions agree on air to address

418
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:41,419
the miners at the mountain
London's Barnard mucuna remains

419
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,128
silent about whether he will join

420
00:43:43,129 --> 00:43:49,519
them on the drive towards Americana
afforded reached out and had been there

421
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,928
before afforded reached
it because there are

422
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:55,728
all these armored vehicles police
armored vehicles and private

423
00:43:55,729 --> 00:43:59,148
security vehicles with fully
addressed tactical guys

424
00:43:59,149 --> 00:44:02,613
in uniforms had never seen military gear.

425
00:44:02,614 --> 00:44:06,378
No policing getters all
automatic Metagraph wills are

426
00:44:06,379 --> 00:44:12,259
fives sixes and I stopped the
thing had reached the kind of

427
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:16,219
front-line or the police but they're
all eating and having a p and

428
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:19,879
you know the parsing time so I kept

429
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,629
going and eventually got to
the right spot and it was

430
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:28,590
clear that this thing was
going to be a huge conflict

431
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:08,689
Minus shutdown answer on positive six.

432
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:11,643
One person who commanded the respect of

433
00:45:11,644 --> 00:45:16,098
all parties and he might have been
able to resolve the conflict was so

434
00:45:16,099 --> 00:45:19,953
Ram opposer because the
former mine worker leader

435
00:45:19,954 --> 00:45:23,689
is now one of the most
influential politicians inside

436
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:30,948
the ruling party Did

437
00:45:30,949 --> 00:45:36,273
it ever cross your mind to go to the
mountain to speak to the workers.

438
00:45:36,274 --> 00:45:41,718
I prefer not to answer that one because
if I ever got to give evidence.

439
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:49,719
Have to deal with things like that email
communication was uncovered at the commission.

440
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:53,869
Sharing Silvano posa energetically lobbying

441
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:59,508
government ministers to increase police
presence and pressing for action to be

442
00:45:59,509 --> 00:46:07,509
taken against the minus chairperson will
have the now procession Emails that

443
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:15,874
were being exchanged between the mind
management the government minister

444
00:46:15,875 --> 00:46:22,953
of minerals and energy which talk about
discussions with the Minister of police.

445
00:46:22,954 --> 00:46:26,324
At the center of which is
a gentleman called Rama

446
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:30,599
posa Saran oppose or writes
about discussions he had with

447
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,858
the Minister of mining
citizenship Bangor she

448
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:38,928
agrees that what we are going through is
not a labor dispute but a criminal act.

449
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:43,248
She's going into a cabinet and we'll
brief the President as well and

450
00:46:43,249 --> 00:46:48,034
get the Minister of police not Tim
tetra to act in a more pointed way

451
00:46:48,035 --> 00:46:50,569
Let's just keep the pressure on them to act

452
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:55,158
correctly by interrupting you but what
is the date of that email which is

453
00:46:55,159 --> 00:47:02,718
the 15th of August 258 exactly 24
hours before the people were moved

454
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:10,719
down then that that mountain stellar I'm a
parser advised that what was taking place.

455
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,119
Uh plainly I'm quoting now task that link

456
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:22,008
criminal and must be characterised as
such in line with this characterization.

457
00:47:22,009 --> 00:47:26,689
There needs to be concomitant
action to address

458
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:32,419
the situation That at the heart of

459
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:39,574
this was the toxic collision
between the S-A-P-S and London.

460
00:47:39,575 --> 00:47:43,848
At the direct level at a
much broader level it can

461
00:47:43,849 --> 00:47:47,793
be called a collusion between
the state and capital.

462
00:47:47,794 --> 00:47:50,569
Black people who get into

463
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:57,559
come white owned companies through the
black economic empowerment process

464
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:04,189
then get into a system one
which is very reluctant to

465
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:11,464
change and to which they don't own
completely and which they don't control.

466
00:48:11,465 --> 00:48:19,439
So Best what they do or why
do we do is to be advocates

467
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:58,128
After the radio broadcast
Joseph Martin's where

468
00:48:58,129 --> 00:49:01,998
the leader of Ankur arrives at the mountain
with the num leadership in an attempt

469
00:49:01,999 --> 00:49:04,938
to persuade their workers
to return to work on

470
00:49:04,939 --> 00:49:08,478
the basis of a commitment made on
air by Longmen management that they

471
00:49:08,479 --> 00:49:12,828
were now willing to talk Joseph and

472
00:49:12,829 --> 00:49:15,019
Tanjore told me that uh he confidently

473
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:18,429
expected that when he arrived that there
would be a meeting between himself.

474
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:19,758
This does Corner.

475
00:49:19,759 --> 00:49:21,454
And the London management.

476
00:49:21,455 --> 00:49:26,898
Instead what he found was the general mere
pamby he asked would either tritium in

477
00:49:26,899 --> 00:49:32,629
leaders go up to the mountain to speak to
the strikers and say leave your arms there.

478
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:35,669
Leave the mountain just leave

479
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:42,319
A small delegation from num went first
and they went and armored truck and

480
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,048
the armored truck approached the mountain

481
00:49:45,049 --> 00:49:49,219
and the strikers were told that
inside the truck was the president of

482
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:52,998
the National Union of Mineworkers
and that he wasn't getting out of

483
00:49:52,999 --> 00:49:57,918
the truck it was clear from the reception.

484
00:49:57,919 --> 00:50:01,469
They simply didn't want they
did not want them there.

485
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:12,798
Well Joseph had a much better reception.

486
00:50:12,799 --> 00:50:15,498
Again he was not allowed by
the police to get out of

487
00:50:15,499 --> 00:50:22,458
the truck And then it wasn't
just in front of them being

488
00:50:22,459 --> 00:50:26,029
spent their insight to come up with other

489
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:30,448
well why don't you simply say you
can come to a data point could just

490
00:50:30,449 --> 00:50:38,449
walk where we just go and talk to
girls preseason workbook you will

491
00:50:40,415 --> 00:50:46,519
finish the term Adam climate
and our plan is to pull

492
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:54,150
back there

493
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:03,500
although I was dead Yeah

494
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:17,778
he made headway on the
strikers came to him and said

495
00:51:17,779 --> 00:51:21,364
Look it's late in the
day it's getting dark.

496
00:51:21,365 --> 00:51:25,894
What we'd like you to do is to come
back at nine o'clock in the morning.

497
00:51:25,895 --> 00:51:27,633
But more significantly.

498
00:51:27,634 --> 00:51:32,718
He was telling them that if they
were to leave the mountain.

499
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:37,979
Then management would address their grievances
in other words at least speak to them

500
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:02,769
So he went back and he reported
that Earth to the police and to

501
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:08,499
the London management to the factor
the Peter Joseph tungiasis is other

502
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:12,519
we're really optimistic I mean general
my-append Bei He said in fact saluted

503
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:18,294
him and said well done and one
of the other Longman managers.

504
00:52:18,295 --> 00:52:22,988
Said yes. Congratulations maybe we
can do that and so there was a sort

505
00:52:22,989 --> 00:52:29,100
of chunk that was a light there
Someone that could be developed

506
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:06,109
to remember that we said our intention is

507
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:11,329
to the people And are also our
intention is to make sure that

508
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:15,619
the people that they leave that
illegal gathering area where they

509
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:20,598
are and that is what we will do today and I

510
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:24,018
said to you we wish that we will do

511
00:53:24,019 --> 00:53:30,768
that still amicable Meaning
we will ask them to leave.

512
00:53:30,769 --> 00:53:36,604
But then I don't want to explain
to you if they don't wet.

513
00:53:36,605 --> 00:53:44,605
What I told you is today we
n-d this mid what we have

514
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:50,539
statements from the National Commission
and the provincial Commissioner which

515
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:55,023
make clear that the night before

516
00:53:55,024 --> 00:53:57,949
the provincial Commissioner had informed

517
00:53:57,950 --> 00:54:02,928
the National Commissioner that accepts could
not persuade the strikers to lay down

518
00:54:02,929 --> 00:54:06,918
their weapons and leave the copy by
negotiations she would issue an instruction for

519
00:54:06,919 --> 00:54:11,299
the strikers to be dispersed
After deliberations.

520
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:16,564
The meeting endorsed the proposal to disarm
the protesting masses and further indicated

521
00:54:16,565 --> 00:54:19,368
that additional resources
must be made available upon

522
00:54:19,369 --> 00:54:23,429
needs identification by the
provincial commissioner Northwest

523
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:57,690
The most foreboding indication
of the intentions of those who

524
00:54:57,709 --> 00:55:04,983
placed an order for for short
events vans from the morgue.

525
00:55:04,984 --> 00:55:07,999
What else are you anticipate
it says Statement of

526
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,329
anticipation of what is good
to have them can we not

527
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:14,209
please move on to the morning of 16 August

528
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:21,169
2012 we then requested one of the
security to call Mr. quality

529
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:25,623
and to advise him that we have arrived as

530
00:55:25,624 --> 00:55:32,118
we were inside the office he said
it doesn't have good news for us

531
00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:38,779
He was referring to the commitment made
by the management that once there were

532
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:45,558
caused renounced vow lens live arms
and return back to work peacefully.

533
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:51,060
Their management we will
engage to their grievances.

534
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:06,619
We now know that this was a joint
operation between London and

535
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:10,188
the police that lawn moon was
completely integrated into

536
00:56:10,189 --> 00:56:13,998
the police strategy and the
system the police strategy It

537
00:56:13,999 --> 00:56:18,978
provided a senior executive to
be part of the police team they

538
00:56:18,979 --> 00:56:23,028
briefed the police officers and
senior generals at least once every

539
00:56:23,029 --> 00:56:30,303
day they provided helicopters and went out
on surveillance expeditions with the police.

540
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:35,269
They provided detention facilities
and at the very end of the day

541
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:37,399
after all the killings
were done they provided

542
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,559
the London game farm for
the people who failed.

543
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:54,109
Are we to believe that
even Major General Pierre

544
00:56:54,110 --> 00:57:00,184
Ha Hidden. py air that
this with her principal.

545
00:57:00,185 --> 00:57:06,603
The Minister of police deed.

546
00:57:06,604 --> 00:57:13,878
You make a telephone call to the minister
reporting to him that Keiling's that

547
00:57:13,879 --> 00:57:16,429
had taken place at Marika on

548
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:21,813
the 30th of August 2012 Do you
remember me asking you that question.

549
00:57:21,814 --> 00:57:26,269
You've asked me a lot of questions
it could have been one of those is

550
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:29,988
general this is a simple
question are you suggesting

551
00:57:29,989 --> 00:57:37,989
that you do not remember for effect you do
not remember me asking you that question I

552
00:57:39,365 --> 00:57:43,489
have had a number of questions from
you and that could have been one of

553
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:50,209
those canes on such a large scale

554
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:55,053
would that have been a matter
of concern to your minister.

555
00:57:55,054 --> 00:58:01,413
I said. Yes. If it was or would have been.

556
00:58:01,414 --> 00:58:04,008
What if anything.

557
00:58:04,009 --> 00:58:12,009
Did the minister Do I have already
given my response to this one so.

558
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:16,878
Nearly the current leader
in Bendigo hub He gives us.

559
00:58:16,879 --> 00:58:21,799
Leadership in that space and
support I have failed maybe

560
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:26,659
to answer in a minute that is appreciated.

561
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:34,660
Maybe I'm short of answering
your question 16 hexane must

562
00:58:35,509 --> 00:58:39,858
figure as he was fingers
Guan list then as long as

563

the heap was a van is a drag
O'bannons argue for a while.

00:58:44,734 --> 00:58:48,993
Figure Emma battle going apply
they tumbled out by MR2 shock.

565
00:58:48,994 --> 00:58:52,623
Intellectual abomasum but
I swear footie meningo

566
00:58:52,624 --> 00:58:58,039
by Mate morning it had become clear to
the miners that London had gone back

567
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,538
on their commitment to talk to

568
00:58:59,539 --> 00:59:02,430
them And

569
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:10,620
I still

570
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:41,280
don't know about so we'll find out

571
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:47,088
Well

572
00:59:47,089 --> 00:59:48,269
my

573
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:00,978
God God

574
01:00:00,979 --> 01:00:08,979
all the way to my dog

575
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:33,044
Furthermore postdocs
example of another add-on.

576
01:00:33,045 --> 01:00:37,769
Itself rather

577
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:50,929
easily

578
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:15,019
The question I

579
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:21,678
ask you is this a decision that you say
you took to implement states three.

580
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:29,463
Was that decision taken because there
had been an escalation. Was it taken.

581
01:01:29,464 --> 01:01:32,238
Even though there hadn't been an
escalation that's the question I

582
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:35,599
wouldn't want to episode.

583
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:40,759
I'll put a little paragraph
degree escalation but what

584
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:45,829
I find so answer is the decision to
is to implement Stage three which

585
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:50,298
you say you took and conveyed to
the provincial commission that was

586
01:01:50,299 --> 01:01:57,549
Rough because of explanation but the fact that
even though they wasn't his professional.

587
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:20,160
Might already know

588
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:37,019
So this is.

589
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:56,400
Yeah free about it should be that
they're not in our free path

590
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:12,699
there may have been I thought up yeah

591
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:26,330
But what do I do and I

592
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:32,254
said well I don't want to

593
01:03:32,255 --> 01:03:38,988
but there are all these are given to talk.

594
01:03:38,989 --> 01:03:45,630
Yet about the planet an icon
set then you have F omega j.

of my banana coconut

597
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:21,634

the face of those workers.

598
01:04:21,635 --> 01:04:28,924
I still remember my weights I said
when colon m can be of ATV asked me.

599
01:04:28,925 --> 01:04:33,468
What now I said all this is in courts

600
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:39,149
ends and mean mortal men those
are my waste. More time

601
01:04:56,380 --> 01:05:00,663
Immediately following Joseph who
turned to his passionate plea.

602
01:05:00,664 --> 01:05:05,969
Over a thousand miners decided to leave
the mountain and make their way home

603
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:32,988
We have been in negotiations
with his gathering for

604
01:05:32,989 --> 01:05:38,974
quite a few days and part of that was that
simple can reach an epic Amoco solution

605
01:05:38,975 --> 01:05:41,598
for them to drop the weapons and

606
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:46,474
disperse unfortunately it doesn't
seem as if negotiations have proven

607
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:49,548
successful and these are
complete service is going to

608
01:05:49,549 --> 01:05:52,788
have to go over to the tactical
phase to ensure that we

609
01:05:52,789 --> 01:05:59,479
take weapons away from from those gathered
yet for that I need or the media.

610
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:07,480

The other

side

625
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:17,760
Just like

626
01:08:33,370 --> 01:08:35,559
that

627
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:28,598
I

628
01:09:28,599 --> 01:09:30,070
Agree

629
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:53,760
Right

630
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:47,448
Who independently Jong helium neon

Bomba

633
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:42,089
And eventually

634
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:06,619
if I think of

635
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:14,620
it as

636
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:19,188
15 to 20 minutes

637
01:12:19,189 --> 01:12:23,793
after the initial shooting All
the commanders should have sit.

638
01:12:23,794 --> 01:12:28,564
What you've shot How many people stand up

639
01:12:28,565 --> 01:12:35,520
stand up they went and carried on a
hunting down people for 20 minutes

640
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:11,538
When I saw what the commission
and the police call s2.

641
01:13:11,539 --> 01:13:17,178
Which is the small copy is several 100 meters
away from the stuff we saw on television.

642
01:13:17,179 --> 01:13:21,420
It is clear that this was nothing
like what had happened at the fussy

643
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:08,628
In Norway and say chi of a wild
west isobar isobar telecom

644
01:14:08,629 --> 01:14:13,728
but we know

645
01:14:13,729 --> 01:14:17,599
from the examination of
the scene pi friends and

646
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:21,903
officers that for example
they found cartridges.

647
01:14:21,904 --> 01:14:24,619
On tops of the rocks we
knew that they found

648
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:28,099
dead bodies at the bottom of the
rocks yeah Would conclude there is

649
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:31,308
a strong possibility that officers stood

650
01:14:31,309 --> 01:14:34,638
and short people who were at the bottom
of the rock I mean you're talking

651
01:14:34,639 --> 01:14:36,349
you at distance of

652
01:14:36,350 --> 01:14:40,278
perhaps only 234 meters the police seem to

653
01:14:40,279 --> 01:14:44,239
stick to this self-defense story they kept
repeating the same thing even though it's

654
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:46,579
blindingly obvious and yet dozens of

655
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:49,699
witnesses saying talking about
people trying to surrender being

656
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:53,659
killed repeatedly shocked as
they were trying to Syria and

657
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:59,099
much as once coming up to three times
with their hands shot repeatedly

658
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:39,448
I went in and had killed they
just accumulate and otherwise.

659
01:15:39,449 --> 01:15:47,449
None. Okay all right

660
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:53,070
So yeah

661
01:15:54,280 --> 01:16:02,280
yeah yeah

662
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:18,710
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah that's where gamma

663
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:51,050
Vertical you can book it
doesn't really look good

664
01:16:52,960 --> 01:17:00,960
in some sense to put him

665
01:17:03,450 --> 01:17:08,109
to put people who

666
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:16,110
need that So if whatever

667
01:17:26,870 --> 01:17:34,140
whatever. As likely

668
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:47,310
to far this.

669
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,080
Someone else

670
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:07,458
Let us take note of the fact

671
01:18:07,459 --> 01:18:15,139
that whatever happened you represent
the best opera responsible policing.

672
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:18,918
You did what you did because you are being

673
01:18:18,919 --> 01:18:25,009
responsible you are making sure
that you continue to live your

674
01:18:25,010 --> 01:18:33,010
own way of ensuring that South
Africans are safe and that you are

675
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:38,239
a citizen of this country and safety stats

676
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:45,813
weekly But who looked out for the
safety of our lowly paid miners.

677
01:18:45,814 --> 01:18:52,008
Surely it should have been those who work
so tirelessly for our struggle for freedom.

678
01:18:52,009 --> 01:18:59,029
Those you now hold the reins of
political power it is the time to

679
01:18:59,030 --> 01:19:02,598
point finger in the first place to point

680
01:19:02,599 --> 01:19:06,693
fingers at those whose
fingers pulled the trigger.

681
01:19:06,694 --> 01:19:10,624
But the foot soldiers.

682
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:14,688
What about those who pulled the strings.

683
01:19:14,689 --> 01:19:19,759
Who gave the orders and
who are they tell me who

684
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:24,858
are the Minister of police The President.

685
01:19:24,859 --> 01:19:28,759
The. He's got the answer this is

686
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:32,838
what we want to see from a commission
and the President and the Ministers

687
01:19:32,839 --> 01:19:36,259
in a security cluster I've
been there and know how it

688
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:41,299
works and if the police carried
out without that kind of

689
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:45,949
instruction then what are they guilty of in

690
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:51,198
terms of the way they dealt with
that situation you see heads need to

691
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:54,888
role at a very high level
and we don't want to

692
01:19:54,889 --> 01:20:00,799
see a commission of inquiry
that white washes things that

693
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:07,909
keeps the lid on In the end we'll apportion
blame to the strike is to the Union

694
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:12,349
splits to the mine owners and so on what

695
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:17,999
about the politicians who
are the ones responsible

696
01:20:47,390 --> 01:20:51,369
And you've got.

697
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,210
You've got to

698
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:24,909
do

699
01:21:24,910 --> 01:21:28,859
That Suppose

700
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:40,388
I have a lambda must hold.

701
01:21:40,389 --> 01:21:48,389
Which you had cloud and I can reduce
the amount of oil is Apple data model

702
01:21:52,990 --> 01:22:00,990
and map I would have a map
of the baton as it had done

703
01:22:03,409 --> 01:22:05,568
an example

704
01:22:05,569 --> 01:22:13,569
lambda Marco But

705
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:32,700
what I would

706
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,790
assume

707
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:57,629
She's

708
01:23:21,370 --> 01:23:27,510
a fail-stop error bound South Africa.

709
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:37,080
Get the plateau days up 75 It told us about

710
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:57,900
how the central change out

711
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:11,880
the finest de comprendre et

712
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:17,389
cetera I

713
01:24:23,450 --> 01:24:31,450
will explain

714
01:24:33,790 --> 01:24:40,539
exactly how to answer

715
01:24:56,540 --> 01:24:59,829
that way To

716
01:25:23,270 --> 01:25:27,809
