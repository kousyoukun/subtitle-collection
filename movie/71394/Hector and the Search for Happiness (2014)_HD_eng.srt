1
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,159
Clara!

2
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,411
Hector.

3
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:26,205
- Morning, sweetheart.
- Morning.

4
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,333
Time to rise, time to shine.

5
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,626
Mm.

6
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,425
Once upon a time,

7
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:40,803
there was a young psychiatrist
called Hector,

8
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,765
who had a very satisfactory life.

9
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,560
His world was tidy,

10
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,186
uncomplicated...

11
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:53,774
And he liked it that way.

12
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:02,617
He took great comfort
in its predictable patterns.

13
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,831
Patterns his girlfriend Clara
was happy to maintain.

14
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,505
Thank you.

15
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,382
Bye.

16
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,468
Oh!

17
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,595
Any lapse
was swiftly rectified.

18
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,842
Hector had a great deal
of patience

19
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,637
for his patients,
if you see what I mean.

20
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,139
Every day, I ask myself,

21
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:10,059
"How could my marriage
just explode the way it did?"

22
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,104
And like
all the best psychiatrists,

23
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:15,731
he knew how to answer
a question with a question.

24
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:19,735
Jane, what does exploding
mean to you?

25
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,530
It's no good.
I have lost my psychic mojo.

26
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,698
Oh, I just can't see
a way out.

27
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,743
All my clients will leave me.

28
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:33,124
Hector, look at me,
I want the truth.

29
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,334
Do you see my light?

30
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,336
Here.

31
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,797
Please, don't lie to me.

32
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,215
I see your point.

33
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,554
His patients never
crossed paths with each other.

34
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,390
They couldn't.

35
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,353
Once in a while,
Hector prescribed pills

36
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:55,980
with funny sounding names.

37
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,150
Roger, have you taken your meds?

38
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,360
I am fucking Ferrari.

39
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:02,445
What?

40
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,280
Experimenting
until he landed upon

41
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,991
- the one most suitable.
- Roger...

42
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,743
Two fat ladies!
Eighty-eight.

43
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,247
His clients always returned.

44
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,207
They gave his name
to their friends

45
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,793
who gave his name
to their friends.

46
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:24,133
After all, Hector's rates
were very fair.

47
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,968
They hadn't changed in years.

48
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,428
Okay.

49
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:32,516
Come to think of it,
neither had Hector.

50
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,979
And if that wasn't enough...

51
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,689
within six days,

52
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,150
our Clara discovers the name
for a companion drug,

53
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,528
which had eluded the marketing
department for six months.

54
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,199
Now, that's a talent for words.

55
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,826
But what I love most
about her

56
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,913
is that in the 10 years
that she's been with us,

57
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:58,209
she has yet to discover
the words "maternity" or "leave."

58
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,173
Clara.

59
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,218
Thank you, all, so much.

60
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:10,262
What's in a name?

61
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,723
A glimmer of hope.

62
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,266
A chance for change.

63
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,392
That's right.

64
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,394
A way to alleviate suffering.

65
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,774
It's been five years
since we launched Tranquiline.

66
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,151
Correction. No, it's been
a lifetime for those

67
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:26,278
- who benefited from it.
- Yeah.

68
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,280
I'm getting emotional.
To Marketing.

69
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,033
I love you guys!

70
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,958
C'est magnifique!

71
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,501
Hit that key.

72
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:47,841
No. No...

73
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:51,387
Not me. Not me. Oh!

74
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,347
Come on!

75
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,517
Give them money.

76
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,232
Oh, it's...

77
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,319
Yay!

78
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,446
"What am I doing?"

79
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,579
You are intriguing me.

80
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:21,417
You are not working
with these people?

81
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,545
Oh, no, I'm Hector.
I'm a psychiatrist.

82
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,172
Psychiatrist.

83
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,217
Hello.
You can help me.

84
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:31,635
Oh, I think not.

85
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,388
But I want a penis.

86
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,475
- A penis.
- You mean happiness.

87
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,814
Everybody want 'appiness
but you cannot own 'appiness.

88
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:47,359
Yes, sorry.
It's, uh, elusive, yeah.

89
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:53,157
- You can't touch happiness.
- You cannot touch 'appiness.

90
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,122
I do!

91
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,959
Listen to me, I want
a penis in my bottom.

92
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:10,341
No, no, you want happiness
from the bottom of your heart.

93
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:15,346
That is what I said,
a penis... in my bottom.

94
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,891
Stop it.

95
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,437
Oh, God!

96
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,438
- Ahh!
- Oh!

97
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,359
I love my Hector.

98
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,319
I love my Clara.

99
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,780
No, really, I love

100
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,991
my weird-ass-eccentric-

101
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,411
nobody-else-is-like-him Hector.

102
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,081
Promise me you'll never change.

103
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,090
Thank you for humoring
all my friends.

104
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,384
You know I'd do
the same for you.

105
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:01,058
- I don't have any friends.
- Of course you do, Hector.

106
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,239
Back off, Malcolm.
That's not funny.

107
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,404
Give me your hand.

108
00:10:56,281 --> 00:11:00,409
Oh, no, see?
Nothing. Nope.

109
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:05,080
I can still, you know, talk
the talk like you do, Hector.

110
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,332
Like the way you answer
a question with a question.

111
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,834
What do you mean?

112
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,337
Yeah, that's it.
"Who's this to?"

113
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,215
- You're so transparent, Hector.
- Am I?

114
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,842
You have your
non-committal nonsense,

115
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:20,679
I have my new age wealth lie
I can serve up to any client.

116
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,222
"Your mother has had
a hard life."

117
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,308
Tell me what mother
hasn't had a hard life.

118
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,727
Or "You're going
on a journey."

119
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,395
I feel like a fraud.

120
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,903
Don't tell me you don't know
what I'm talking about.

121
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:40,157
Everyday, you're just going
through the motions,

122
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:43,785
never being authentic.

123
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,287
Authentic.

124
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,502
You know what, Anjali, I think this
represents some sort of growth.

125
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:56,798
You know, just be careful that
when you have these visions...

126
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,342
Hallucination.

127
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:03,305
That the ego might just be
shaping them to its own needs.

128
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,768
Let's try the medication
for another week, shall we?

129
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,857
But the tumor was benign.

130
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,026
Yeah.
No, no, yeah. No.

131
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:18,529
Yes or no?

132
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:21,657
Yes.

133
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:27,371
So, this isn't even
a cancer story.

134
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,387
Hector.

135
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:46,640
You seem a little blue.
Not your usual self.

136
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,016
Is it Roger?

137
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,018
No. No.

138
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,980
Um, actually, Ben,
it's my other patients.

139
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,148
You know, they all like
to think they're hopeless.

140
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,026
That's hopeless.

141
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,117
Are you happy?

142
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,749
You're breaking up with me,
aren't you?

143
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:13,834
No! No.

144
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,211
You can't just come out
with a question like that.

145
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,255
You have to build up to it.

146
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,715
You know you have
to have a preamble.

147
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,926
Alright, alright.
I'm sorry.

148
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,887
Do you consider yourself
to be happy?

149
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,932
Alright, look.
Okay.

150
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,061
I've got it, I've got it,
I've got it.

151
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,106
Far be it from me,
and I...

152
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,693
Forgive me for asking,
and I don't mean to pry.

153
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:47,534
But... do you consider yourself
as a happy person?

154
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:51,538
Is this because I'm not ready
to be a mother?

155
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,540
- Other hand, please.
- Absolutely not.

156
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,542
- But I've only done the left one.
- Sorry.

157
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:59,671
This has nothing... nothing to do
with you not being a mother.

158
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,468
I know what you're saying, Hector.

159
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:10,682
No one wants to live with a person
knowing they'll never be happy.

160
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,646
- So, you're, uh...
- Back in business.

161
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,273
- Yes.
- And you can...

162
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,984
Channel what's to come.
See the future. Yes.

163
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,403
- Mm-hmm.
- Give me your hand.

164
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,656
- Oh, not again.
- Please. Come on.

165
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,242
Wait, are we off the clock?

166
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,702
- Call it even.
- Cool.

167
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,579
But you are getting a bargain.
I charge more than you.

168
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,582
I keep telling you,
you should put up your fees.

169
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,214
You're going on a journey.

170
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,007
Am I?

171
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,096
Be serious.

172
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,848
I am. You are.

173
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:52,933
To distant lands.

174
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,899
Well, is there anything else?

175
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,237
I see you're at peace.
I see you're happy.

176
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,072
Really?

177
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,743
I see you loving like
you've never loved before.

178
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,247
Wow!

179
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,292
Yeah, well.

180
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:24,214
- Maybe in my next life.
- Hector, this is your next life.

181
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,343
- I see you with a dead dog.
- What?

182
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,678
You're a little boy.
You're crying.

183
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,680
Oh, my God!
You were an only child.

184
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,723
- A lonely child, you poor thing.
- Oh, come on.

185
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:37,602
It makes sense, your life.
How exhausting.

186
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,480
- I see a girl on a beach.
- What do you mean a girl on a...

187
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,732
- Why have you never called her?
- What do you mean call her?

188
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:45,610
- Are you sterile?
- No, I am not sterile.

189
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:46,903
No, no, no, wait.
That's not it.

190
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,614
It's your life.
Why am I getting sterility?

191
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:52,159
Someone is hurting you,
making you angry.

192
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,411
- Time's up.
- It's you.

193
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,164
- Come on.
- It's you. You're making you angry.

194
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,124
Just stop, okay! Stop.
Stop projecting.

195
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,168
I'm not the patient here,
Anjali, come on.

196
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,295
- So exhausting.
- Yes, so exhausting.

197
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,506
I know, I know. Thank you.
See you next week. Thank you.

198
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,926
Who's Agnes?

199
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,309
I can't sell the house,
the cracks are back.

200
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,020
They'd taken it off the menu.
The evening was ruined.

201
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,272
The only reason to go there
was the white pie.

202
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,107
I'm thinking of taking in
other people's laundry.

203
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,359
To get some extra cash
to help pay for the nanny.

204
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,069
Otherwise, we're going under.

205
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,572
I was doing the exercises, but I fell asleep.

206
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,908
And now the sergeant says
I'm not standing straight.

207
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,075
Nobody brought me a birthday...

208
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,285
Present I actually wanted.

209
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,411
- About the matter of weight...

210
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,580
But his feet
really are a problem.

211
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,708
Nipples just aren't
an erogenous zone for men.

212
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,461
I'm gonna have to cut the nanny
down to five days a week.

213
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,631
- It's an uphill battle.
- I'm at the end of my rope.

214
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,309
The end of your rope.

215
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,686
- The end of your rope!
- Yeah.

216
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:02,896
I'll give you a rope.

217
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,857
Okay, a child witnessing
his parents gunned down

218
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,276
in a drive-by shooting,
there's a rope!

219
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,820
A midwife in Africa,
trying to deliver babies

220
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,989
with no running water,
that is a rope!

221
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,658
Tintin.

222
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,493
Literally at the end
of his rope.

223
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,286
Does he cut the rope
to save his own life

224
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,914
or does he hold on to stop his friend
from falling to a certain death?

225
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:24,042
Cut the rope, Tintin!
Cut the rope!

226
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,171
Jane, Jane!
Jane! Jane!

227
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,883
I'm sorry.
I am very, very sorry.

228
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:36,221
I don't know...
I don't know what came over me.

229
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,764
Same time next week?

230
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:42,602
Um, I have to take my daughter
sailing for a couple of days.

231
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,688
Yes. Yes, I do remember
you mentioning that.

232
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,982
So, the following week?

233
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,276
I still won't be back.

234
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,737
You said a couple of days.

235
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,114
Yeah.

236
00:17:56,784 --> 00:18:02,872
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight... nine.

237
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,000
This is not
a couple of days, okay?

238
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:09,129
This is ten days holiday.
Jane, fucking own it!

239
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:27,856
Malcolm...

240
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,611
Malcolm, you stupid bastard!

241
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,823
Give me that.
Give me that!

242
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,581
Oh! Ridiculous!

243
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,008
Euforalan.

244
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:58,428
Solatun.
As in a ton of sun.

245
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:02,265
Um, Apollonax.
Oh, no, that's the wrong list.

246
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,933
Oh, that's funny,
that's for August.

247
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,894
Uh, erectile dysfunction.

248
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,481
What do you think, by the way?
Apollonax?

249
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,274
Apollo and his axe?

250
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,109
Hoo!

251
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,154
I need to get away.

252
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,618
Take a trip.

253
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:27,248
I'm not making my patients
any happier and I just...

254
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,085
I need to do some research.

255
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,419
On what?

256
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:35,131
Happiness, you know,
so I can help.

257
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:38,718
Look at my life, Clara,
I just...

258
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:41,012
I feel like such a fraud.

259
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,682
You know, like
an armchair traveler

260
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:47,268
dishing out worldly advice.

261
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,229
When?

262
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,481
Soon.
Very soon. Now.

263
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,275
There's no way I can get
the time off, I mean not now.

264
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,361
Not at this time of the year.

265
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,323
I know.

266
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,455
I'm sorry.

267
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,375
Okay, I'm sorry.
I really, really am.

268
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,462
Will you be here
when I get back?

269
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,715
How long will you be gone?

270
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,261
I don't know.

271
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,515
Then I can't answer
the question, can I?

272
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,652
I think you're right, I think
I just went totally off the map

273
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,447
with that whole Tintin reference.

274
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:42,657
Now, don't get me wrong.

275
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,243
There's real value
to your inner Tintin.

276
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,454
- My what?
- Your inner Tintin.

277
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:48,997
The Boy Scout in you.

278
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,749
Don't ever lose it.

279
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,835
It's just that...
Well, how can I put this.

280
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,757
Just so long as Tintin
isn't driving the bus.

281
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,719
Where were you thinking of going
on this journey of yours?

282
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,596
I was thinking China.

283
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,890
Oh, China!

284
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,773
Brilliant.

285
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,274
Sleeves...

286
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,776
- Removable.
- Obviously.

287
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,695
- Trousers, convertible.
- Obviously.

288
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,697
Hat, reversible.

289
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,823
Obviously.

290
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:26,117
Oh, and in case
of emergencies...

291
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,702
Oh, God forbid.

292
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:31,080
Passport, Imodium,
antihistamine, nose strips.

293
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:33,208
- And remember, avoid dairy.
- Yes.

294
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,751
Got enough socks?

295
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,962
Uh... yes, I think so.

296
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,925
I don't want to over-pack it,
and, you know, it all fits.

297
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,636
Neat and tidy, like us.

298
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:49,974
- What's like us?
- Tidy.

299
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,520
It's like who we are.
Tidy.

300
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:57,774
It's like that's our...
agreement, isn't it?

301
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,110
Hector...

302
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,821
I get it.

303
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:07,200
If you're gonna do this,
do it totally.

304
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,826
Make it worthwhile.

305
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,496
Okay, you have
my permission, alright?

306
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:16,251
- Really?
- Really. I mean it.

307
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:18,545
Totally.

308
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,631
Can I help you, sir?

309
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,604
Arms up, please, sir.

310
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,079
- Hey, you sit in my seat.
- Pardon?

311
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,164
I make an Internet booking
weeks ago.

312
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:56,708
No, no, what are you, 39-D?

313
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,835
Expects you that you
travel on my lap?

314
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,920
Look, there's obviously been
some sort of mix-up.

315
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:04,132
- I'll do whatever you want.
- Let me go and check.

316
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,969
This way, sir.

317
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,347
- Your seat.
- Okay.

318
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:13,391
Great.

319
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,976
Sorry, could you move your bag?
Sorry.

320
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,311
Champagne, sir.

321
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,146
- Is the Pope circumcised?
- Uh-hmm.

322
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,732
Don't you mean...

323
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,321
- Mm.
- Ahh!

324
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,865
Can I please get the champagne
from first class at least?

325
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,326
- A decent one.
- Ah, I doubt it.

326
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,577
This isn't decent?

327
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,329
- Down or memory foam?
- What?

328
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,831
The pillow.
Did you order memory foam?

329
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,334
I forget. Did I?

330
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,085
That's my little joke.

331
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,087
I'm sorry, sir, I'm going
to need to stow your bag.

332
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,464
Of course.
Please do.

333
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:52,096
- Oh.
- Sorry. I'll get it.

334
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,932
Oh! It's like Twister.
Oh, you've won.

335
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,184
Ah.

336
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,605
Thank you.

337
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:08,821
Ohh.

338
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,323
Isn't that sweet?

339
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,413
Oh, look at that.

340
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:21,000
It's a gift from my other half.

341
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:23,836
She must have snuck it
into my bag and I didn't know.

342
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,213
"Fill these pages."

343
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,511
I will.

344
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:09,257
- Anything from Duty-Free, sir?
- Oh, yes, please.

345
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:13,094
Actually, I'd like the keep-it
handy travel candy, please.

346
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,097
- Immigration form?
- Oh, yes, please. Thank you.

347
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,364
Give it back.

348
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:36,409
- It costs more than your car.
- Thank you.

349
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,040
- Sorry.
- Don't worry, sir.

350
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:46,294
- The glass is unbreakable.
- Ah. Very clever.

351
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,045
Unbreakable.

352
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,717
Unbreakable.

353
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:53,718
Hmm.

354
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,306
Oi.

355
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,184
Uh, sorry, um...

356
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,227
Are you sure there's no room
in first class?

357
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:04,520
I'm sorry, sir.

358
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:37,595
- Wife?
- Old flame, university.

359
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,806
We all got one of those.

360
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,140
First time in China?

361
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,726
- Yeah.
- Business or pleasure?

362
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:47,480
Research, actually.
I'm a psychiatrist.

363
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,983
I want to know
what makes people happy.

364
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,502
Hector.

365
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,713
Edward.

366
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,549
Watch yourself.

367
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,591
Okay.

368
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,770
Thank you.

369
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,106
Oh.

370
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,316
That fucker's got my fucking pen.

371
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,611
Edward!
I still got your pen.

372
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,867
Yes, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Alright.

373
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,035
Wait.

374
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,415
I can't thank you enough.

375
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,958
So, where are you staying?

376
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,418
At the Marriott.

377
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,253
The Marriott for happy?

378
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,463
Well, it's central.

379
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:57,508
Why, have you got
any other suggestions?

380
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,303
Let me show you happy.

381
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,611
Whoever said
money can't buy happiness.

382
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,613
Fuck you.

383
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,365
This is incredible.
This is incredible.

384
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:05,493
Just incredible, the whole thing.
The meal, my room.

385
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,954
Edward, I'm just...
I'm curious, okay?

386
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:10,706
Far be it from me,
and forgive me for asking.

387
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,876
- And I don't mean to pry.
- Time is money. Spit it out.

388
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:15,544
- Right. Are you happy?
- When you work as much as I do,

389
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,298
you don't have time to ask
yourself that question.

390
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:21,092
That's why
I'm thinking of quitting.

391
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,885
What, now?

392
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,137
God, no.
In another $20 million.

393
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,350
Mind you, I've been saying that
for the last $100 million.

394
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,019
Oh, you bust a gut, you earn
enough money, you retire,

395
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,855
you do something you like.

396
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,567
Or nothing at all.

397
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:39,944
And then you're happy?

398
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,198
Yeah, we're addicted.

399
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:48,244
Divorced or dead.
What the hell?

400
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,456
Oh.

401
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,750
You pick a goal,
you work towards it.

402
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:56,002
Makes you feel better.

403
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:57,962
Just keep moving,
that's my motto.

404
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,965
Maybe there's only one way
to retire and be happy.

405
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,717
And what's that?

406
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,803
Don't retire.

407
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,682
It's time for some real China.
Come on.

408
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,600
Real? Okay.

409
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:14,186
Let me just grab a bit of this.

410
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,193
It's not what you know, Hector.
It's not who you know.

411
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,320
It's how much you pay
who you know.

412
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,425
- Hey, how are you?
- How have you been? Hello.

413
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:51,015
- Hey, Jim.
- Hey, Edward.

414
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,641
- Back from Berlin.
- You're back in town.

415
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:54,810
By the way,
this is Mr. Perry.

416
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,990
What are you doing?

417
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,161
- Uh, I'm...
- Are you a writer?

418
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,873
No, um... No, I'm just
taking some notes.

419
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,722
- Do you believe that?
- Well, I wouldn't know.

420
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,724
I'm not rich
and I'm not important, so...

421
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,937
What a coincidence.
Neither am I.

422
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,272
Oh.

423
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,608
"The search for happiness."

424
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:47,988
Is it in here?

425
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,117
No.

426
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:54,245
Perhaps over there.

427
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,122
Uh, no, no.

428
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:58,207
That is torture for me.
I don't dance.

429
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,876
Why not? I mean, you don't like
to move around...

430
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,545
- No, I really...
...and move your body a little?

431
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,838
- No.
- Come on, it's fun.

432
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,090
I... You know what, it's...

433
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:11,178
Or is it right here...

434
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,348
in your smile?

435
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:22,064
My name is Ying Li.
I'm a student.

436
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:24,859
Hector.

437
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,736
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

438
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,158
Oops, sorry.
Too long.

439
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:38,497
- So, what do you study, Ying Li?
- Tourism.

440
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,166
I'm a tourist.

441
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,710
What a coincidence.

442
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,637
Oh, oh, oh.
Hm-mm.

443
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:56,849
- Edward!
- Having a good time?

444
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,435
Yeah.

445
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,647
Oh, that was mine?
I wasn't aware I was drinking.

446
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,149
You go next.

447
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,442
Listen to this.

448
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,866
Well, I will drink to that.

449
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,367
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

450
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,913
Hey, I have an idea.
I have an idea.

451
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:23,083
Who is available tomorrow night?
Let's mark the bottle.

452
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,960
- Hey, you're cheating.
- I'm not cheating.

453
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:27,171
- You are cheating.
- No, no, no.

454
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:30,549
- I'm not cheating.
- You are cheating.

455
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,885
- You're cheating.
- Lighten up, lighten up.

456
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,929
Alright, alright, alright.

457
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,438
Will I see you again?

458
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,357
What hotel are you staying at?

459
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,651
Hyatt on the Bund.

460
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,654
What a coincidence.

461
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:00,537
Welcome back
to Hyatt on the Bund.

462
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:20,474
Well, I'm, uh...

463
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:24,645
I'm not sure what the custom is
for escorting a young lady

464
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,231
to her room.

465
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,770
I'll be right back.

466
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,670
I'm not sure
what the custom is...

467
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,882
for undressing in front of...

468
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,928
Hector?

469
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:41,638
Hector?

470
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,850
Hector.

471
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:22,781
This is Hector.

472
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:24,366
Did you have
a good time last night?

473
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:26,326
Yeah, you know happy.

474
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,495
Hey, I gotta go.

475
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,416
Um, I'd really like
to take you to lunch.

476
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,334
- Really?
- Yeah.

477
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,836
Um, you pick.

478
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,797
Just text me when and where.

479
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:18,128
Yeah.

480
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,923
Yeah, it's nice.
I like it.

481
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,561
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

482
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:44,363
- Hi.
- Hi.

483
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,325
Listen, this is China.

484
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,494
You're Chinese.
I'm clueless.

485
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,663
I need to get
to the mountains.

486
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,541
Why don't you come with me?

487
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,251
- Too soon?
- Hmm.

488
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,586
It's preamble, Hector.
Preamble.

489
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:03,382
No.
It's just... you're different.

490
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,384
You're kind.

491
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:06,552
I'm not used to it.

492
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,559
They look very happy.

493
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:15,352
YING Ll:
They're with their friends.

494
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,229
Why are they sitting
in the middle of the street?

495
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:21,316
They have nowhere else to go.
It's their day off.

496
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:23,986
They have no money
to stay in cafes.

497
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,946
They send their income
to their families,

498
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,990
so they meet here
on the street.

499
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,784
They come from
the countryside like I do.

500
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,829
My sisters and mother
are still there.

501
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,498
Look at them, they're like
a happy little island

502
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,292
in a sea
of grim businessmen.

503
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,960
Makes you wonder.

504
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,420
Hey, listen.

505
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:44,298
Your mother and your sisters,
we could pay them a visit,

506
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,384
you know on our trip.

507
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,430
Oh, Hector.

508
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:57,352
The difference between
those three ladies and me...

509
00:39:57,437 --> 00:40:02,566
is that there's no shame
in how they make their money.

510
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,319
They can show
their faces back home.

511
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,907
I can't.

512
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,534
Oh.

513
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:14,578
Oh, why is that then?

514
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,500
Ying Li!

515
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,713
Hey, wait.

516
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,214
Sorry. Sorry.

517
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:28,216
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

518
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:30,344
Your friend paid
for last night.

519
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,347
Who's paying for today?

520
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:39,936
But you seemed so real.
You tricked me.

521
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,605
You tricked me.

522
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,360
What are you doing?
What are you...

523
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:57,913
Ying Li!

524
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:00,374
Ying Li!

525
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,176
It's Monday, we are closed.

526
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,678
Oh, yeah, but I've come
a very long way.

527
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:22,641
I'm a psychiatrist. I'm trying to
discover what makes people happy.

528
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,560
- It's Monday, we are closed.
- Okay, okay, okay.

529
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:28,313
Look, far be it from me,
and forgive me for asking,

530
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:31,149
and I don't mean to pry,
but would you consider yourself

531
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:32,818
to be a happy person?

532
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:35,737
What part of Monday
don't you understand?

533
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,284
A trainee.
He has a lot to learn.

534
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:43,286
- Would you like to come in?
- Uh, yes, please.

535
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:44,955
'Cause I might not
be around next week.

536
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:48,583
The moment of death
is indeed uncertain.

537
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:50,502
Now, come in.

538
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:58,552
- Come, come, quick!
- Okay.

539
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,354
When you've been a fugitive,

540
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,064
you've been imprisoned
for your beliefs,

541
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,275
you've lost family
and loved ones.

542
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,527
I mean, you've just been
through so much.

543
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:19,322
- How is it you're so happy?
- Because I've been through so much.

544
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,534
Alright, searching for happiness
is one thing,

545
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:25,245
but making it a goal, that just
doesn't work, does it?

546
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,789
Higher than that, Hector.

547
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,252
More important than
what we are searching for

548
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,671
is what we are avoiding.

549
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,047
Like unhappiness.

550
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:39,801
So, don't make unhappiness
not the goal.

551
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:41,845
Higher than that.

552
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,808
Avoiding unhappiness
is not the road to happiness.

553
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,687
You hold all the cards, Hector.

554
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:14,711
It's very noble this book
you're writing.

555
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:18,214
When you reach the end of it,
come back to me.

556
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:21,343
I would like to see
what you've learned.

557
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:24,596
Right, you mean when I'm
passing through this area again.

558
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,681
We have Skype.

559
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:28,683
"Sky-pee."

560
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:31,353
You have Skype?

561
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:36,733
- Hi.
- Hector?

562
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,860
- Hi!
- Hi!

563
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:40,528
Hi.

564
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:42,697
How is it going?
How's work?

565
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:43,990
It's great.

566
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:46,284
Can you believe it,
they're going with Apollonax?

567
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:49,037
Whoo-hoo! Market research says
it's the biggest erection

568
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:51,456
they've had to...
I mean, sorry, sorry.

569
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:55,168
Reaction they've had
to a survey in 10 years.

570
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,254
Clara, look where I am,
I'm in a monastery.

571
00:45:58,339 --> 00:45:59,506
Where you belong.

572
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,300
How is Shanghai?

573
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:04,678
Yeah, I've made friends
with a rich banker,

574
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,721
and he took me around town
and we...

575
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:09,808
Now, you know every kind
of happiness money could buy.

576
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:22,654
It's weird seeing you like this,
you look really small.

577
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:36,209
Hector, come, come.

578
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,003
You have to see.
The wind. Come!

579
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:04,779
Hector! Look.

580
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:08,241
Do you see?

581
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,076
All of them.

582
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:23,965
Looks like we lost
the scent, eh?

583
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:29,137
Best keep moving, shall we?

584
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:48,114
Poor bastard.

585
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,492
I'm sorry.

586
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:51,659
Where to next?

587
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:54,162
- Africa.
- For happy?

588
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,997
Or unhappy.

589
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:57,415
Have to wait and see.

590
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,919
You're a very, very
strange person, Hector.

591
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,838
The kind of person I normally
would avoid like the plague.

592
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:09,010
Glad I didn't, buddy.

593
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,180
Thank you, Edward.
I mean it.

594
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:29,572
Sir, you do realize that
this is four flights.

595
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:31,699
- That is two days.
- Absolutely.

596
00:48:31,784 --> 00:48:34,744
And the last flight is not so...

597
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:36,996
- Well, it is not exactly...
- Absolutely.

598
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:40,041
Let me put it this way.

599
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:41,835
First class.

600
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,002
Business class.

601
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:44,796
Economy.

602
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,174
You.

603
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:51,678
Bring it.

604
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:58,143
Oh! Oh!

605
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:03,690
Oh, my God!

606
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,819
If you look at this plane,
you'll notice it's quite old.

607
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,988
That means it's never
crashed before.

608
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,824
Should be quite reassuring.

609
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:15,159
Thank you... I think.

610
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:18,955
From this point forward,
I swear,

611
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,291
I will be nicer to my patients
who are afraid to fly.

612
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:25,169
- Oh, are you a doctor?
- I'm a psychiatrist, yeah.

613
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:27,547
So, I assume you've read this.

614
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:31,134
Yeah, yeah, I'm familiar with
Coreman from my UCLA days.

615
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,468
Just making a name for himself.

616
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:34,637
Oh, quite a name.
I saw him on CNN.

617
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:36,222
What do they call him?

618
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:38,558
The Einstein of happiness.

619
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:41,311
I've read it twice.
You can keep it.

620
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,438
I like it
but I don't think I need it

621
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,565
as much as the country
it was written for.

622
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,025
Thanks.

623
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:49,152
Oh, my God!
Is this really safe?

624
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:54,032
Oh, God!

625
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:56,034
Do you have children?
Are you married?

626
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:59,370
- Um, no.
- Why not?

627
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:01,497
Why do I get the feeling
there's a woman out there

628
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:03,833
in the world asking herself
the very same question?

629
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,086
You know, there's really
only one question.

630
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:15,011
Whoa!

631
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:26,773
Side effects
may include happiness.

632
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:31,486
So, what about you?
What makes for your happiness?

633
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,739
Home, family.

634
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:37,408
The idea that my children
can live a normal life

635
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:40,203
without bodyguards
taking them to school.

636
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:44,290
Have you ever had
sweet potato stew?

637
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,626
Real sweet potato stew?

638
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,878
Oh, you have to.

639
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:52,006
Here's the deal.
If we land safely,

640
00:50:52,091 --> 00:50:53,967
one night this week,
my mother's house,

641
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:57,428
my whole family,
sweet potato stew.

642
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:02,934
There will be a tomorrow,
my friend.

643
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,602
Whoa!

644
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:11,442
I'll be right back.

645
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:18,074
- Why don't you let me do this?
- That's very kind.

646
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:25,373
Get the button, get the button,
there's a button.

647
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:26,666
Hector!

648
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,544
Michael, Jesus!

649
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:30,753
Help.

650
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:33,506
Can anyone...
I've got a Swiss army knife.

651
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,175
- Oh, dear.
- This is Marcel.

652
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,552
- He's your bodyguard.
- Hi.

653
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:40,972
Hector. Welcome.

654
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:44,350
Cars are scarce here,
so better to take precautions.

655
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:45,977
Okay, let's go.

656
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,320
See, you haven't changed.

657
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,449
Neither have you.

658
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:00,992
I mean, look at you.

659
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:03,244
Hector goes to Africa.

660
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,456
You and Aggie,
you seemed so solid,

661
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,582
what happened with that?

662
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,292
Uh...

663
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,586
Hey, Agnes and I always knew
you'd wind up here

664
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,004
when the dust settled.

665
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:15,965
Yup, all this.

666
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,925
This was my calling,
wasn't it?

667
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:21,012
Well, the dust, as you put it
never really settled.

668
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,722
There's been progress,
though, right?

669
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,808
I mean, foreign aid. Every time
I blink there's another fundraiser.

670
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:28,227
There's a big difference
between being here

671
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:30,897
and being here
to be photographed being here.

672
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,524
The money doesn't always make it
to where it's needed most.

673
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:35,109
It never leaves the city.
It's useless.

674
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:38,821
It's useless.
Still a ways to go, Hector.

675
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:42,075
But, hey, that's why
we're here, right?

676
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:01,928
Okay.

677
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,346
You have a good night's rest, okay?

678
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,723
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

679
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:07,517
- Whoa! Hey!
- Don't give them anything.

680
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,018
They'll never leave you alone.

681
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:11,354
Hector, we'll pick you up
at 6:00.

682
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,064
Go straight to the clinic, okay?

683
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:15,066
See you tomorrow.

684
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,214
Good evening.

685
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:40,800
Um... hmm.

686
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,176
What sort of beers you have?

687
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:48,474
Thank you.

688
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,602
I think you might need
a bigger sign outside.

689
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:53,938
Some people seem to be missing it.

690
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:58,901
Hey, guys. He wants to know
how is the peacekeeping going?

691
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:01,821
You're here to save the planet?

692
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,406
Plant some trees?

693
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,200
Um, no, actually
I'm here to help out

694
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:08,452
at the Edulu Clinic
for a week or two.

695
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:10,371
What's in it for you?

696
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,959
- Nothing.
- Hmm.

697
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:18,504
Your English is very good.
Where are you from?

698
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:21,340
Want to see my passport?

699
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:23,092
Here you go.

700
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:29,140
I prefer your hair
the way it is now.

701
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:34,937
That's good.
I like that.

702
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:38,482
So, uh, what brings you here?

703
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:41,360
- Farming.
- Farming, oh.

704
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:46,157
What kind, and uh, would that be
what makes you happy?

705
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:48,659
What are you, the fucking
New York Times?

706
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:51,913
No, I'm just researching
what makes people happy.

707
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:59,337
If you're wearing a wire,
you're dead.

708
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:00,546
- And you know what?
- Yes? Yes, yes?

709
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:04,133
No one will care.
Okay.

710
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:06,219
No wire.
Sorry for the shirt.

711
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,388
Oh.

712
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:12,141
My name is Hector.
I'm a psychiatrist.

713
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:13,559
Very well, Hector.

714
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:16,520
I'll bet what I farm
makes more people happy

715
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:19,357
than the crap you dish out.

716
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:23,486
I see. A farmer.
I get it.

717
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:24,695
Drugs.

718
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:30,076
Forgive me,
but if your happiness

719
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,370
causes other people's unhappiness,

720
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:34,330
then how can that be happiness?

721
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,666
Doesn't that bother you?

722
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,960
I don't cause unhappiness.

723
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:42,672
I respond to it.
Same as you, we both fill a need.

724
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,674
But the demand we don't create.

725
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:48,344
Self-righteous fuckers.

726
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,429
What's your solution?

727
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:52,056
Another Bible?

728
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,600
So, the country gets more poor.

729
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:58,854
People starve, babies die,
and the leaders couldn't care less.

730
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:03,943
If you want to be happy,
take care of your own.

731
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,615
So, you're happy?

732
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:15,037
No.

733
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:17,707
Because my wife isn't happy,

734
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,459
which makes my kids unhappy.

735
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:23,671
And if my family
is not happy,

736
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,172
how can I be happy?

737
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:29,510
She sees a shrink.

738
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:33,889
He gave her something new,
but it just makes her worse.

739
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:37,393
Would you mind if I ask
what she's taking?

740
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:39,854
I don't know.

741
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:43,149
Maybe if you were to show me
the prescription, I could help.

742
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:47,320
- Why?
- I'd like to.

743
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,030
Bullshit.

744
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:51,699
You're in it for yourself
like everyone else.

745
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:56,412
Why would either of us
wish to prolong anyone else's misery?

746
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,665
Fuck you.

747
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:16,932
Holy grief, what is that?

748
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:20,269
Higher.

749
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:25,232
With patience and perseverance,
you can climb the mountain.

750
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,253
Well, I don't know these dosages.

751
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:48,214
And, uh, these two clash.

752
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,424
Let me, um...

753
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:54,637
I'm sorry, me and pens...

754
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:56,889
Thank you.

755
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,682
Um, this woman is great.

756
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:01,185
She's based in Bogota.
She's an old colleague of mine.

757
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:03,062
Tell her that I referred your wife.

758
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,397
I think she's been over-medicated.

759
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,816
Could be the source
of her immediate problem.

760
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,317
This is my phone number.

761
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:11,445
Give me a call.
Let me know how she goes.

762
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,447
Thank you.

763
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:18,160
Hector, it's past 6:00.
We gotta go.

764
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:22,748
What were you doing
even talking to him?

765
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:25,334
That's Diego Baresco.

766
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:28,462
That's the kind of guy that
drags this country into shit.

767
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:34,385
So, wait, you know that guy?

768
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:37,012
Everybody knows Diego Baresco.

769
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:42,518
Hector. Really?

770
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:20,097
Mujari.

771
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:21,182
- This is Hector.
- Hi.

772
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,977
So, let's see.

773
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:27,521
- How are you feeling?
- Very good.

774
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:32,526
Can you feel the baby move?
So move on to Buruthi.

775
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:34,695
Feel okay, hmm?

776
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:37,656
This is my friend, Hector.
He's gonna help us, too.

777
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:40,159
We'll just take a look.

778
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:43,787
I don't hurt anymore.
Can I go home?

779
00:59:43,872 --> 00:59:45,664
You're not leaving here
until I say so.

780
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:49,460
But my sister, she needs me.

781
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:52,713
Buruthi lost his mother
last month.

782
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:57,384
Listen, if you're not well,
you're no help to your sister.

783
00:59:57,469 --> 00:59:59,970
Good. Good boy.

784
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:01,639
Stay with him.
Just talk to him.

785
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:04,225
That I can do.

786
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,688
So, Buruthi...

787
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:13,108
how old is your sister?

788
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,366
- What?
- Your face, it's funny.

789
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,660
It's like this.

790
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:29,166
Yeah, yeah.
That's my listening face.

791
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:30,626
How about this?

792
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:35,130
You, you're funny.

793
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:36,715
Oh, am I?
Thank you very much.

794
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,720
You're a big boy.

795
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:51,772
This is gonna be nothing.

796
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:58,821
He's gonna be fine.

797
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,739
Gonna be fine.

798
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:07,871
Mama. Mama!

799
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:13,419
Shh, shh.

800
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:19,466
Is that a...
There's a lion over here.

801
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:23,345
Michael, there's two lions,
just quite close.

802
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:26,682
Excuse me. Excuse me.

803
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:29,643
Take off your iPod,
there's a lion really close by.

804
01:01:29,728 --> 01:01:32,271
Is this normal,
to have a lion?

805
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,320
See you, buddy.

806
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,703
You know you could always
stay awhile.

807
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:50,414
We sure could use
another medical doctor.

808
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:51,957
It's tempting.

809
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:54,710
I mean, watching you all week.
You are a necessity.

810
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,086
Me, I'm just...
I'm a luxury.

811
01:01:56,171 --> 01:01:56,211
Me, I'm just...
I'm a luxury.

812
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:59,757
I sometimes feel like psychiatry
comes with affluence.

813
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:01,216
You know, the richer the city,

814
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:03,719
the more psychiatrists there are
per square mile.

815
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,220
What does that tell you?

816
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:08,307
It tells me you're being
too hard on yourself.

817
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:12,978
Come on, Hector, it's not
some kind of a competition.

818
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:17,483
The mind can hurt
as much as the body.

819
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:24,823
And maybe if I seem happy,

820
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:28,827
it's because I know
I'm loved for who I am.

821
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,007
Okay.

822
01:03:14,249 --> 01:03:16,792
- Hello!
- Hello.

823
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:18,877
- Hey, I'm in Africa.
- Wow!

824
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:22,297
Great. I'm with Michael,
and he hasn't changed.

825
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:24,466
He looks exactly like he did
in the photo I showed you.

826
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:26,260
You never showed me
a photo of Michael.

827
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:29,805
- Didn't I?
- You just think you did.

828
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:32,307
Mm. I thought I had.

829
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:37,813
Hey, listen, Clara, about
that last conversation we had...

830
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:38,814
Hi, boys.

831
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:42,860
Hey, guys!

832
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:45,821
Hey.

833
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:48,323
It's a private conversation.

834
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:50,450
- Seriously, Clara...
- Hector, you know, I got it.

835
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:51,535
It's fine.

836
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:53,829
Let's not make this harder
than it already is.

837
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:55,414
- Where are you going?
- Out.

838
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:58,834
- What, like that?
- No, in this.

839
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:00,335
- Oh.
- It's a work event.

840
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:03,839
I've never seen that dress.
That dress is new.

841
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:05,174
I know.

842
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:07,843
- I've got to go. Bye, Hector.
- What do you mean, bye?

843
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:09,428
We've only...

844
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:12,139
Out? Huh.

845
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:15,309
Okay.

846
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:16,852
Out.

847
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:19,396
- Hector.
- Hey.

848
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,356
They told me you'll come.
You're early.

849
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:22,858
You can get class another time.

850
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:25,027
So, you are ready
for sweet potato soup?

851
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:26,236
I've never been readier
in my life.

852
01:04:26,321 --> 01:04:27,779
Well, cowboy.

853
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:31,867
Clear the way, you amateurs!
Chef coming through.

854
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:34,286
Chef with a severe case
of the saw bits.

855
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:38,040
Tit-for-tat, only difference is
I don't need a sexy black dress.

856
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,085
Alright, alright, alright.

857
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:43,670
Yeah, everyday.

858
01:04:43,755 --> 01:04:45,214
Mm-mm. More wine.

859
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:46,465
More wine, more wine.

860
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:48,508
More wine, more wine!

861
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:54,223
Aha! Whoa!

862
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:56,516
Have I said how much
I love this music?

863
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:58,727
I can almost dance.
Almost.

864
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:01,813
I see you,
extremely pretty cousin.

865
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:03,774
Beware, okay?
I have permission.

866
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:10,781
Cheers. Whoo!

867
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:14,993
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Bye-bye.

868
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:17,120
Oh, I'm gonna miss you, too.
You're so beautiful.

869
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:18,455
Thank you.

870
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,624
- Well, thank you, my friend.
- Thank you so very, very much.

871
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:21,792
Thank you.

872
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:23,252
Hey, who's available
tomorrow night?

873
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:24,419
I'm available!

874
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,421
Oh, oh, oh,
bless you, my son.

875
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:28,757
Bye.

876
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:29,883
Bye.

877
01:05:38,226 --> 01:05:40,894
Sweet potato stew! Yay!

878
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:05,877
Oh, okay.

879
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:09,131
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

880
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,431
- Keys...
- In the cab, man!

881
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:19,016
Hurry!
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

882
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:20,642
I want you to go outside.

883
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:22,853
- Move, move, move.
- Stay there!

884
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:05,812
Keep-it-handy travel candy?

885
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:17,282
Why are you different?
Why are you both different?

886
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:24,539
What is this place?

887
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:39,554
No, you've got to understand.
I'm a psychiatrist.

888
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:40,972
I'm neutral, I'm Switzerland.

889
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:04,412
Look, can we just see this
is one of those

890
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:08,875
sort of random events that's just
deeply inconvenient for both of us.

891
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:10,502
Get this piece of shit
out of my sight.

892
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:19,845
No, wait, come back!

893
01:08:21,013 --> 01:08:23,932
Please don't go.

894
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:59,301
A losing soldier,
that I will never be.

895
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:16,193
Soldier go, soldier come.
Barrack remain.

896
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:25,869
How much do you think
we can get for him?

897
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:27,662
Forget it.
He's already seen us, dickhead.

898
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:32,751
So, so, what do we do, boss?

899
01:09:33,377 --> 01:09:34,669
Let him rot.

900
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:04,324
Keep-it-handy travel candy.

901
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:06,785
Nice.

902
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:09,579
Once upon a time,

903
01:10:09,664 --> 01:10:14,042
there was a psychiatrist
called Hector,

904
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:17,170
who was scared to death of dying

905
01:10:17,255 --> 01:10:18,964
before he ever really lived.

906
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:27,681
I'm sorry, I've never
really been...

907
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:31,142
See, the thing is...

908
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,061
Would you mind giving me
some privacy?

909
01:10:58,546 --> 01:11:01,214
If you're going to do it, Hector,

910
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:03,550
do it totally.

911
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:08,305
She has yet to discover
the words "maternity" or "leave".

912
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:11,558
You're in it for yourself
like everyone else.

913
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:17,063
You tricked me.

914
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:46,593
You hold all the cards,
Hector.

915
01:12:00,524 --> 01:12:01,816
Clara.

916
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:03,485
Clara!

917
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:10,450
Wait, wait,
where are you taking me?

918
01:12:10,534 --> 01:12:11,159
Please, please...

919
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:13,244
Ow!

920
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:14,120
Ow!

921
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:21,544
This shit's funny, man.

922
01:12:21,629 --> 01:12:24,464
"Happiness is being loved
for who you are."

923
01:12:24,548 --> 01:12:26,132
- Hmm?
- I know. That's true, boss.

924
01:12:28,552 --> 01:12:32,514
Clara, Ying Li, Clara, Ying Li,
Clara, Ying Li...

925
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:35,266
What's this one,
it's been crossed out?

926
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,477
It says that the evil
you do in this life

927
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:41,106
could cost you your happiness
in the next.

928
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,941
No, it doesn't.
I'm sorry, I made that up.

929
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:44,776
It says happiness
could be the freedom

930
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,486
to love two women
at the same time.

931
01:12:50,991 --> 01:12:52,700
Look, look, look.

932
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:55,620
I know the police
aren't gonna track me down.

933
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:57,789
But the thing is I'm really
trying to help a friend of mine

934
01:12:57,873 --> 01:12:59,207
whose wife is very ill.

935
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:00,750
He's really counting on me.

936
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:02,544
If I just suddenly disappear,

937
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:04,337
then he's gonna come
looking for me,

938
01:13:04,421 --> 01:13:07,173
and you do not want this man
as an enemy.

939
01:13:07,258 --> 01:13:08,508
Even if you're friends
with the president himself,

940
01:13:08,592 --> 01:13:11,719
it won't make a difference.

941
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:14,305
Well, it's not the president,
it's Diego Baresco.

942
01:13:20,437 --> 01:13:22,313
Prove it.

943
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:26,359
I can't.

944
01:13:29,029 --> 01:13:30,655
Wait, no, no.

945
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:32,198
I promise you I know him.
I know him.

946
01:13:32,283 --> 01:13:35,118
- He's a friend of mine...
- Come. Come.

947
01:13:35,202 --> 01:13:36,870
I promise you...

948
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:38,079
Shut up!

949
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:40,290
- Please.
- Why are you here?

950
01:13:40,374 --> 01:13:42,125
I'm researching
the state of happiness.

951
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:42,959
Bullshit!

952
01:13:43,043 --> 01:13:44,794
Oh, God!

953
01:13:50,634 --> 01:13:53,428
I'm...
trying to find the means

954
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:55,430
by which to make my patients happy.

955
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:56,973
Bullshit!

956
01:13:57,057 --> 01:13:59,100
God! Stop it!
Please, stop it.

957
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:02,103
No, no!

958
01:14:02,188 --> 01:14:03,771
Oh, God!

959
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:08,610
I want to know
if I can be happy.

960
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:34,844
This probably
isn't the right moment, but I...

961
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:40,099
I just wondered what your
personal idea of happiness is.

962
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:42,352
You know, personally.

963
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:47,357
If you want it,
you take it.

964
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:49,692
That's very insightful.
I just want to...

965
01:14:49,777 --> 01:14:50,985
Would you mind if I just
wrote that down,

966
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:53,488
just for posterity?

967
01:14:57,117 --> 01:14:58,284
Give him the notebook.

968
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,425
Oh, God!
I don't have a pen.

969
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:15,426
I just never have a pen.

970
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:40,910
One last thing.

971
01:15:40,995 --> 01:15:44,414
Um, one final,
final request, I promise.

972
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:47,375
Would one of you gentleman
mind just making sure

973
01:15:47,459 --> 01:15:51,337
this gold pen finds its way
back to my dear friend,

974
01:15:51,422 --> 01:15:53,214
Diego Baresco?

975
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:18,156
Go!

976
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:08,706
Higher.

977
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:14,670
With patience and perseverance,
you can climb the mountain.

978
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:23,971
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

979
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:30,103
I'm alive!

980
01:17:31,688 --> 01:17:34,899
I'm alive!
I'm alive!

981
01:17:37,694 --> 01:17:39,445
I'm alive!

982
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:55,211
Hello, Hector.

983
01:17:55,295 --> 01:17:57,130
I'm alive, too.

984
01:17:57,214 --> 01:18:00,174
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait a minute.

985
01:18:00,259 --> 01:18:03,094
Oh, look,
you're very beautiful.

986
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:05,221
Very beautiful but, uh...

987
01:18:05,305 --> 01:18:08,099
Let's just, uh, dance.

988
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:09,183
Okay.

989
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:46,762
Happiness is knowing
how to celebrate.

990
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:02,403
- Hector.
- Clara, hi.

991
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:05,448
Clara, I got kidnapped.
Really.

992
01:19:05,532 --> 01:19:08,784
- Is that a cut? Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine... now.

993
01:19:08,869 --> 01:19:10,161
I nearly died.

994
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:12,747
I thought about you so much.

995
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:16,959
- And?
- So very much.

996
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:18,794
Hector, why are you
telling me this?

997
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:20,922
I just... What am I
supposed to think?

998
01:19:21,006 --> 01:19:22,882
I don't hear from you for...

999
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:26,677
Are you coming home?

1000
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:28,095
Not yet.

1001
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:29,931
Look, I've got to go.

1002
01:19:31,516 --> 01:19:33,684
- Oh, no!
- What is it? What?

1003
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:35,603
Dropped the cup on the floor.
You see, that's what you do?

1004
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:38,231
- I didn't do...
- Tell me what you want.

1005
01:19:38,315 --> 01:19:41,025
I'm not part of your project.

1006
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:43,819
You just have to decide, Hector.
Yes or no.

1007
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:47,073
Yes or no.
I've got to go.

1008
01:19:47,157 --> 01:19:48,741
Do you know where
you're going next?

1009
01:19:48,825 --> 01:19:51,160
No.

1010
01:19:55,082 --> 01:19:58,542
- You know where you're going next?
- Yes, Los Angeles.

1011
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:02,338
Agnes.

1012
01:20:02,422 --> 01:20:04,674
It's a work-related matter.

1013
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:07,051
Unfinished business.

1014
01:20:12,849 --> 01:20:16,435
So... finish it.

1015
01:20:20,774 --> 01:20:23,067
Champagne, sir?
Would you like the vintage?

1016
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:24,527
Why not?

1017
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:27,697
Madame, the vintage?

1018
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:29,073
Why not.

1019
01:20:32,202 --> 01:20:34,954
Why else do we travel
first class?

1020
01:20:50,595 --> 01:20:52,888
Sorry to interrupt
ladies and gentlemen,

1021
01:20:52,973 --> 01:20:55,141
but if there's a doctor
on board this plane,

1022
01:20:55,225 --> 01:20:58,728
can you please contact the cabin
crew? Thank you very much.

1023
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:01,355
Once again, if there
is a doctor on board...

1024
01:21:16,747 --> 01:21:18,664
Please!

1025
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:21,709
Please don't let them
turn the plane around.

1026
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:24,545
I have to see my sister
one last time.

1027
01:21:24,629 --> 01:21:27,214
Look, uh, on a scale
of 1 to 10,

1028
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:28,966
ten being the most pain
you can imagine,

1029
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:30,509
where would you place yourself?

1030
01:21:32,637 --> 01:21:34,388
Nine.

1031
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:38,684
I need to see the pilot.

1032
01:21:40,103 --> 01:21:42,646
She had a massive tumor
removed from her brain

1033
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:45,316
about three months ago
and the swelling is acute.

1034
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,943
- Should we turn around?
- No, no, no.

1035
01:21:48,028 --> 01:21:51,405
But, uh, if you can lower
the altitude of the plane,

1036
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:53,240
it would make a big difference
to the pressure on her brain.

1037
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:56,077
- Be a tremendous help to her.
- I'll check air traffic control.

1038
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:04,043
And I've lived in six countries.
Can you believe that?

1039
01:22:04,127 --> 01:22:06,796
Ladies and gentlemen,
please don't be concerned.

1040
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,048
We will be flying
at a lower altitude

1041
01:22:09,132 --> 01:22:10,633
for the remainder
of our journey, thank you.

1042
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:14,136
Okay, that is going to make
a huge difference, alright?

1043
01:22:14,221 --> 01:22:16,305
Let's try and get that nine
down to a five.

1044
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:17,681
Mmm.

1045
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:19,767
Okay.

1046
01:22:19,851 --> 01:22:21,644
Madame, do you mind?

1047
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:24,397
If you must.

1048
01:22:31,905 --> 01:22:34,407
Okay. May I?

1049
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:44,667
Oh.

1050
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:56,762
Do you have
any children, Doctor?

1051
01:22:56,847 --> 01:22:58,180
No.

1052
01:22:59,057 --> 01:23:02,226
My husband and I,
it was our only regret.

1053
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:04,520
We couldn't.

1054
01:23:04,604 --> 01:23:06,355
But, you know what?

1055
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:08,107
It was bloody good fun trying.

1056
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,697
Oh, you okay?

1057
01:23:14,781 --> 01:23:18,701
There you go. Let it pass.

1058
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:24,707
You know,
after my last surgery,

1059
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:28,544
I was in and out
of consciousness for days.

1060
01:23:28,628 --> 01:23:30,963
They said I wouldn't make it,

1061
01:23:31,047 --> 01:23:34,925
and I remember the moment.

1062
01:23:36,303 --> 01:23:38,095
I remember it so clearly.

1063
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:43,309
I was in a sandstorm
walking with all these people,

1064
01:23:43,393 --> 01:23:47,605
our heads covered and walking
in the same direction.

1065
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:50,232
And I kept thinking
to myself, why?

1066
01:23:50,317 --> 01:23:51,901
Why am I in this group?

1067
01:23:54,654 --> 01:23:56,697
I wasn't scared.
I was...

1068
01:23:56,781 --> 01:23:58,824
I don't know, puzzled?

1069
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:03,412
And then, I heard my name
being called,

1070
01:24:03,497 --> 01:24:05,748
"Jamilla, over here."

1071
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:09,460
And I looked to my right.

1072
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:12,379
And in the middle
of an open space was this...

1073
01:24:12,464 --> 01:24:15,841
Oh, it was this beautiful...

1074
01:24:16,968 --> 01:24:21,013
What do you call it,
the happy-go-round?

1075
01:24:21,097 --> 01:24:24,433
Merry-go-round.
That's a carousel.

1076
01:24:26,144 --> 01:24:29,897
And all the people
that I know and love...

1077
01:24:32,025 --> 01:24:34,151
are riding on this carousel.

1078
01:24:37,113 --> 01:24:40,824
They're laughing and waving.

1079
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:45,496
Waving for me to join them.

1080
01:24:53,964 --> 01:24:57,675
It took everything I had
to run to them...

1081
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:02,846
but I did it.

1082
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:14,775
It was my last ride,
wasn't it?

1083
01:25:19,573 --> 01:25:23,242
Yes.
It was your last ride.

1084
01:25:39,926 --> 01:25:44,847
All those faces,
all those hearts.

1085
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:53,772
I'm such a lucky woman.

1086
01:26:09,914 --> 01:26:11,415
Ladies and gentlemen,

1087
01:26:11,499 --> 01:26:13,917
thank you once again
for your cooperation.

1088
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:16,587
It made a big difference,
believe me.

1089
01:26:24,346 --> 01:26:28,307
Don't take her to the hospital.
Take her straight to this address.

1090
01:26:28,391 --> 01:26:30,726
Are you going to be okay?

1091
01:26:35,315 --> 01:26:37,524
I'm not afraid, Hector.

1092
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:41,528
People who are afraid of death
are afraid of life.

1093
01:26:44,115 --> 01:26:46,283
You have a real talent,
you know.

1094
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:48,327
Oh!
Not really my field.

1095
01:26:48,411 --> 01:26:51,997
No, you misunderstand.

1096
01:26:52,082 --> 01:26:54,416
Listening is loving.

1097
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:12,578
Of all the places
you could have chosen.

1098
01:28:19,169 --> 01:28:21,128
This beach, you know,
this whole area,

1099
01:28:21,212 --> 01:28:24,256
it's just...
it's changed so much.

1100
01:28:25,258 --> 01:28:27,634
Well, nostalgia is not what
it used to be, Hector.

1101
01:28:30,889 --> 01:28:32,306
You've been busy.

1102
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:34,641
Lilly!

1103
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:40,063
Hey, baby!

1104
01:28:41,065 --> 01:28:43,066
Jack.

1105
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:45,068
Okay.

1106
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:47,196
Okay, you've been really busy.

1107
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:51,784
Kids, this is Mommy's...

1108
01:28:53,703 --> 01:28:55,829
Mommy's Hector.

1109
01:29:03,421 --> 01:29:06,298
Not too bad.

1110
01:29:08,134 --> 01:29:10,886
- Hello!
- Hello!

1111
01:29:10,970 --> 01:29:12,346
Oh.

1112
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:13,430
Oh, God!

1113
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:20,646
I got you seeing
Professor Coreman tomorrow.

1114
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:24,274
You owe me. That guy is on
a fast track to the Nobel.

1115
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:25,943
His happiness book
is going through the roof.

1116
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:27,694
I know, I read it.
Somebody gave it to me.

1117
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:29,947
- I liked it.
- Yeah, me too.

1118
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:31,073
Hate him.

1119
01:29:31,157 --> 01:29:32,407
- We hate him.
- We hate him.

1120
01:29:32,492 --> 01:29:34,368
Hate him.

1121
01:29:35,662 --> 01:29:38,038
- Hey, I saw Michael.
- Oh, in Africa?

1122
01:29:38,122 --> 01:29:40,082
- Is he happy?
- He's gay.

1123
01:29:40,166 --> 01:29:42,876
- Are you?
- Gay?

1124
01:29:42,961 --> 01:29:45,712
No, happy.
I mean is there someone?

1125
01:29:45,797 --> 01:29:47,130
Uh, yes.

1126
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:49,132
- Clara.
- Great.

1127
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:51,343
I may have fucked up.

1128
01:29:54,055 --> 01:29:56,473
It's... They can't hear.

1129
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:13,156
Ah! The Indiana Jones
of happiness.

1130
01:30:14,033 --> 01:30:16,827
Alan, very nice to meet you.

1131
01:30:16,911 --> 01:30:18,078
You, too!

1132
01:30:18,162 --> 01:30:21,748
Hector wants to know the secret
to a happy marriage.

1133
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:23,709
From a mathematician?

1134
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:28,755
- Hector?
- Oh, my God!

1135
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:30,132
Jack.

1136
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:44,438
Hi!

1137
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:46,565
Hey, I'm in L.A.

1138
01:30:46,649 --> 01:30:49,484
I knew it.
You're with sock drawer.

1139
01:30:49,569 --> 01:30:51,778
- Sock drawer?
- That skank in the sock drawer.

1140
01:30:51,863 --> 01:30:55,490
In the photo, the one you've
kept hidden from me.

1141
01:30:55,575 --> 01:30:57,951
That's what this whole trip's
been all about, am I right?

1142
01:30:59,078 --> 01:31:01,455
Jesus, Clara,
she's not a skank, okay?

1143
01:31:01,539 --> 01:31:04,499
She's a psychologist.
Not to mention the pregnant mother

1144
01:31:04,584 --> 01:31:07,669
- of two beautiful children.
- Ouch!

1145
01:31:09,047 --> 01:31:11,089
That really hurt, Hector.
You know it did.

1146
01:31:11,174 --> 01:31:13,842
Look, she is my oldest friend,
alright?

1147
01:31:13,926 --> 01:31:15,927
What were you doing
in my sock drawer anyway?

1148
01:31:16,012 --> 01:31:18,513
Putting away your socks!

1149
01:31:18,598 --> 01:31:22,142
Before taking care of every
other aspect of your life.

1150
01:31:22,226 --> 01:31:24,311
Maybe if you
didn't assume I needed

1151
01:31:24,395 --> 01:31:27,189
so much taking care of I could
get on taking care of myself.

1152
01:31:27,273 --> 01:31:28,774
You know what
smothering is, Clara?

1153
01:31:28,858 --> 01:31:30,942
It's mothering with an S.

1154
01:31:31,027 --> 01:31:33,904
Oh, that is the lamest
fucking thing I've ever heard.

1155
01:31:33,988 --> 01:31:35,739
You have paid for this.

1156
01:31:35,823 --> 01:31:37,449
Well, at least I don't make
a living making up

1157
01:31:37,533 --> 01:31:41,078
meaningless, manipulative names
of seriously dodgy drugs.

1158
01:31:43,373 --> 01:31:45,499
Is this call as bad
as I think it is?

1159
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:47,709
Yes.

1160
01:31:47,794 --> 01:31:49,086
Yes, I think it is.

1161
01:31:50,088 --> 01:31:51,380
Fine!

1162
01:31:51,464 --> 01:31:53,507
At last a decision.

1163
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:56,009
I can get on
with my meaningless life.

1164
01:31:56,094 --> 01:31:57,552
Oh, shut...

1165
01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:15,737
Darling, sweetheart.

1166
01:32:15,822 --> 01:32:17,989
Where is my fucking pen?

1167
01:32:18,074 --> 01:32:19,950
Oh, Diego.

1168
01:32:20,034 --> 01:32:22,035
Um, it's... it's here.

1169
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,371
Actually I've got it.
It's, um, here.

1170
01:32:24,455 --> 01:32:25,664
Saved my life.

1171
01:32:25,748 --> 01:32:26,790
How are you anyway?

1172
01:32:26,874 --> 01:32:28,625
- How's things? How is she?
- Very good.

1173
01:32:28,710 --> 01:32:33,130
I feel like I got
my wife back, and a lot more.

1174
01:32:35,425 --> 01:32:38,009
What's the name
of your friend's clinic?

1175
01:32:38,094 --> 01:32:39,386
The one who hates me?

1176
01:32:39,470 --> 01:32:41,096
Uh, the Edulu Clinic, why?

1177
01:32:41,180 --> 01:32:44,391
I want to make a donation.
Anonymous, of course.

1178
01:32:44,475 --> 01:32:47,352
What's in it for you?

1179
01:32:47,437 --> 01:32:48,520
Nothing.

1180
01:32:49,355 --> 01:32:50,856
Good man.

1181
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:52,858
Go fuck yourself.

1182
01:33:13,796 --> 01:33:15,130
Are you okay?

1183
01:33:15,214 --> 01:33:16,298
Yes, I'm okay.

1184
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:20,510
How did the, uh,
call go with Clara?

1185
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:24,097
Oh, so horrendous.
Terminal.

1186
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:25,891
I'm sorry.

1187
01:33:25,975 --> 01:33:28,310
- You want to talk about it?
- Have we met?

1188
01:33:28,394 --> 01:33:29,811
Oh, right, you're Hector,
of course, you don't.

1189
01:33:29,896 --> 01:33:32,314
What was I thinking?

1190
01:33:32,398 --> 01:33:35,275
- Right, Agnes...
- Uh, yeah.

1191
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:36,568
I knew you were going to
ask me about this

1192
01:33:36,652 --> 01:33:38,820
- and I thought about it last night.
- Uh-huh.

1193
01:33:39,822 --> 01:33:44,868
I have never felt so happy, really.

1194
01:33:44,952 --> 01:33:48,663
Or exhausted. I mean, the chaos,
sometimes it's out of control.

1195
01:33:48,748 --> 01:33:50,624
But, you know,
I have a job I love

1196
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:54,711
and a husband I love
and two beautiful kids I love.

1197
01:33:54,796 --> 01:33:56,463
A home I love.

1198
01:33:56,547 --> 01:33:59,508
The only real shadow
on my happiness

1199
01:33:59,592 --> 01:34:02,552
is when I tell myself
it's too good to last.

1200
01:34:02,637 --> 01:34:06,473
And, Hector, the marriage,
whatever the marriage is,

1201
01:34:06,557 --> 01:34:08,934
the marriage itself
is never in question.

1202
01:34:09,018 --> 01:34:11,812
And that makes me happy.

1203
01:34:21,405 --> 01:34:22,531
What?

1204
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:27,202
I don't know, it's just...

1205
01:34:27,286 --> 01:34:28,620
You know...

1206
01:34:29,956 --> 01:34:31,581
Thinking about
what might have been.

1207
01:34:38,172 --> 01:34:39,172
What?

1208
01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:47,556
Agnes.

1209
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:49,516
- What?
- Never mind, forget it.

1210
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,851
It's not even worth discussing.

1211
01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:53,311
Oh, come on, what?

1212
01:34:53,396 --> 01:34:55,397
What might have been?
God!

1213
01:34:55,481 --> 01:34:58,233
How about what is right now?

1214
01:34:59,318 --> 01:35:02,696
It just suits you, doesn't it,
holding on to a fantasy?

1215
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:04,906
You know when you put someone
on a pedestal or on hold

1216
01:35:04,991 --> 01:35:06,908
or to the side or whatever
you want to call it.

1217
01:35:06,993 --> 01:35:08,410
Do you think
that's a compliment?

1218
01:35:08,494 --> 01:35:10,620
Because it's not.
It's the opposite.

1219
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:14,165
And you know why?
Because I am not that fantasy.

1220
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:16,835
I'm better than that fantasy.
I am real.

1221
01:35:16,919 --> 01:35:18,461
I got married.

1222
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:20,964
I had a baby,
and then another one,

1223
01:35:21,048 --> 01:35:22,549
and I'm having another one.

1224
01:35:22,633 --> 01:35:24,175
And do you think I wanted
it to be Hector there

1225
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:27,304
cutting the umbilical cord?
No, because Hector

1226
01:35:27,388 --> 01:35:31,558
would throw up and then faint
because you're squeamish.

1227
01:35:31,642 --> 01:35:34,477
You're emotionally squeamish.

1228
01:35:34,562 --> 01:35:37,230
You really are some kind
of weird psychiatrist,

1229
01:35:37,315 --> 01:35:39,608
- you know that, right?
- I... Where's...

1230
01:35:39,692 --> 01:35:44,237
Oh, I'm trying so hard here to
avoid the words "move"and "on",

1231
01:35:44,322 --> 01:35:46,323
but, for crying out loud,
I am just,

1232
01:35:46,407 --> 01:35:49,826
"Oh, flag that woman for,
I don't know, 12 years.

1233
01:35:49,911 --> 01:35:51,912
Yeah, get back to that one
when the time's right."

1234
01:35:51,996 --> 01:35:54,080
So, nothing, nothing,
nothing, nothing,

1235
01:35:54,165 --> 01:35:56,958
then, "Hi! I'm in Africa.
See you Monday."

1236
01:35:57,043 --> 01:35:59,419
I mean, I'm just some kind of
box you had to check, aren't I?

1237
01:35:59,503 --> 01:36:01,087
No...

1238
01:36:14,101 --> 01:36:15,727
I did love you, Hector.

1239
01:36:20,942 --> 01:36:23,693
But I love Alan now.

1240
01:36:25,529 --> 01:36:27,781
Guess what?

1241
01:36:27,865 --> 01:36:31,701
Whatever it is you think
you're in love with...

1242
01:36:31,786 --> 01:36:32,460
it's not me.

1243
01:37:02,984 --> 01:37:06,194
I know what you're thinking,
how much do researchers make?

1244
01:37:07,989 --> 01:37:09,990
Everything in this world
is going up...

1245
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:15,120
yet happiness is going down.

1246
01:37:15,204 --> 01:37:18,289
Oh, dear, oh, dear,
oh, dear, oh, dear.

1247
01:37:18,374 --> 01:37:22,252
How many of us, I wonder,
can recall

1248
01:37:22,336 --> 01:37:27,257
a childhood moment
when we experienced happiness

1249
01:37:27,341 --> 01:37:29,092
as a state of being?

1250
01:37:29,176 --> 01:37:32,929
That single moment
of untarnished joy.

1251
01:37:33,014 --> 01:37:39,644
That moment when everything
in our world inside and out...

1252
01:37:41,313 --> 01:37:43,857
was alright.

1253
01:37:43,941 --> 01:37:47,152
Everything was alright.

1254
01:37:51,031 --> 01:37:54,200
But, now, we become
a colony of adults

1255
01:37:54,285 --> 01:37:57,579
and everything is all wrong
all the time.

1256
01:37:58,998 --> 01:38:03,460
It's as if we were on a quest
to get it back,

1257
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:06,713
and yet the more we focus
on our own personal happiness,

1258
01:38:06,797 --> 01:38:08,715
the more it eludes us.

1259
01:38:08,799 --> 01:38:12,385
In fact, it's only when
we are otherwise engaged,

1260
01:38:12,470 --> 01:38:16,681
you know, focused, absorbed,
inspired, communicating,

1261
01:38:16,766 --> 01:38:19,934
discovering, learning,
dancing, for heaven's sake,

1262
01:38:20,019 --> 01:38:25,565
that we experience happiness
as a by-product, a side effect.

1263
01:38:25,649 --> 01:38:26,858
Oh, no.

1264
01:38:26,942 --> 01:38:28,818
We should concern ourselves

1265
01:38:28,903 --> 01:38:31,905
not so much with the pursuit
of happiness,

1266
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:35,325
but with the happiness
of pursuit.

1267
01:38:36,118 --> 01:38:40,622
But how do we
measure happiness?

1268
01:38:40,706 --> 01:38:43,500
Emotions are like colors, you know.

1269
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:48,421
Difficult to explain once
but not now, not anymore.

1270
01:38:48,506 --> 01:38:52,550
All those who read auras,
step aside,

1271
01:38:52,635 --> 01:38:54,719
this is science.

1272
01:38:54,804 --> 01:38:57,972
A new frontier in its infancy,
but not for long.

1273
01:38:58,057 --> 01:39:02,685
Functional electrical impedance
tomography by evoked response.

1274
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:04,938
Or as I call it,
"Peeping Tom."

1275
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:10,485
My portal into the mysterious
minutiae of human emotions.

1276
01:39:10,569 --> 01:39:13,279
Emotions that
for the very first time,

1277
01:39:13,364 --> 01:39:18,034
we can separate, specify
and quantify in actual units.

1278
01:39:18,118 --> 01:39:21,037
Now, this male subject
is Japanese.

1279
01:39:21,121 --> 01:39:23,540
Look at the abundance
of bright orange

1280
01:39:23,624 --> 01:39:27,585
around the happiness area,
verging on ecstasy.

1281
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:30,547
It's as if the brain
was smiling.

1282
01:39:30,631 --> 01:39:33,716
Cause, half a liter
of warm sake.

1283
01:39:35,427 --> 01:39:37,637
And here we go again,
same Japanese gentleman,

1284
01:39:37,721 --> 01:39:39,848
eleven hours later,

1285
01:39:39,932 --> 01:39:44,435
the color of grim despondency,
verging on suicide,

1286
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:47,522
otherwise known
as an excruciating hangover.

1287
01:39:47,606 --> 01:39:51,985
Ask yourselves,
is this worth that?

1288
01:39:56,574 --> 01:39:59,617
Oh, thank you!
You first, Agnes.

1289
01:39:59,702 --> 01:40:02,662
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Oh, yes, we made a deal.

1290
01:40:02,746 --> 01:40:04,998
Off you go into
the isolation booth.

1291
01:40:05,082 --> 01:40:06,583
Helmet on.

1292
01:40:06,667 --> 01:40:09,335
I want you to imagine yourself
in three situations.

1293
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:12,088
One that makes you
very happy, one very sad,

1294
01:40:12,172 --> 01:40:15,216
and one very scared.
Recent memories can be useful.

1295
01:40:15,384 --> 01:40:19,554
Do not tell me the order,
I will guess it myself.

1296
01:40:21,599 --> 01:40:23,474
They say I'm a mind reader.

1297
01:40:23,559 --> 01:40:24,767
It's a bloody lie, I'm not.

1298
01:40:24,852 --> 01:40:28,688
I'm just a good diagnostician
with an awesome toy.

1299
01:40:32,484 --> 01:40:34,235
Ready when you are.

1300
01:40:50,252 --> 01:40:51,544
Out you come.

1301
01:40:55,466 --> 01:40:58,009
As I thought,
you're an open book.

1302
01:40:58,093 --> 01:40:59,719
Sad, scared, happy
in that order.

1303
01:40:59,803 --> 01:41:02,597
- Final answer.
- Wow, yeah!

1304
01:41:02,681 --> 01:41:06,351
- You're good.
- Your turn, Hector.

1305
01:41:06,435 --> 01:41:08,102
Um, you know what,
I think I'm gonna...

1306
01:41:08,187 --> 01:41:10,855
- Your turn, Hector.
- Okay.

1307
01:41:11,982 --> 01:41:14,442
Get over yourself.
You weren't in any of mine.

1308
01:41:14,526 --> 01:41:16,444
Oh, right.

1309
01:41:16,528 --> 01:41:18,321
Sit, my dear.

1310
01:41:20,532 --> 01:41:23,117
By way of identifying
the emotions,

1311
01:41:23,202 --> 01:41:26,621
I've assigned a color to each
corresponding part of the brain.

1312
01:41:26,705 --> 01:41:28,081
It's pretty obvious, really.

1313
01:41:28,165 --> 01:41:30,750
Sunny yellow, happy,
ice blue, sad,

1314
01:41:30,834 --> 01:41:34,212
battery-acid green, fear.

1315
01:41:34,296 --> 01:41:37,006
It corrodes you, you know.

1316
01:41:43,389 --> 01:41:44,931
Right.

1317
01:41:45,015 --> 01:41:47,517
Sad, scared, happy,
don't tell me the order,

1318
01:41:47,601 --> 01:41:48,935
and be specific.

1319
01:41:49,019 --> 01:41:50,645
It's all about specificity.

1320
01:41:58,112 --> 01:42:01,155
- Shut up!
- Stop, please!

1321
01:42:08,288 --> 01:42:10,331
That's odd.

1322
01:42:10,416 --> 01:42:14,293
It's as if he's filtering,
moderating his feelings.

1323
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:18,172
Something's holding him back,
some kind of barrier.

1324
01:42:28,767 --> 01:42:32,562
No, no, no, these are not
the emotions of a grown man.

1325
01:42:32,646 --> 01:42:33,980
Tell me about it.

1326
01:42:34,064 --> 01:42:35,732
He's going to have
to dig a lot deeper.

1327
01:42:35,816 --> 01:42:38,735
There is no deeper.

1328
01:42:38,819 --> 01:42:40,903
I must admit,
I'm a little baffled.

1329
01:42:40,988 --> 01:42:45,408
Hi, this is Hector.
I think I can go deeper.

1330
01:42:45,492 --> 01:42:47,452
Oh, fuck,
we left the mic on.

1331
01:42:47,536 --> 01:42:48,536
Oh, well.

1332
01:42:49,788 --> 01:42:51,914
I think I know where to go.

1333
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:55,460
Courage, Hector,
we're right there with you.

1334
01:44:04,655 --> 01:44:07,949
This is Hector,
who the hell is this?

1335
01:44:10,828 --> 01:44:15,081
I wanted to be a mother.

1336
01:44:15,165 --> 01:44:18,417
Just...

1337
01:44:18,502 --> 01:44:21,087
Just not yours.

1338
01:44:22,881 --> 01:44:27,176
Clara, um, listen,
don't go anywhere, okay?

1339
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:29,762
Just... just stay there, okay?
Hang on.

1340
01:44:29,847 --> 01:44:32,682
Professor, can we stop?
I need to take this call.

1341
01:44:32,766 --> 01:44:35,643
Alright.
Please, please.

1342
01:44:35,727 --> 01:44:38,104
Uh, Clara, Clara,
are you still there?

1343
01:44:39,314 --> 01:44:43,192
- Yes, I'm here, yeah.
- Thank, God!

1344
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:45,820
Clara, listen.

1345
01:44:52,870 --> 01:44:55,246
I'm sorry I didn't give you
any explanation

1346
01:44:55,330 --> 01:45:00,376
for this insane journey,
but the truth is,

1347
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:03,421
I didn't really have
any reasons of my own.

1348
01:45:03,505 --> 01:45:06,799
I didn't explain it to myself.

1349
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:10,845
I have
learned a lot, you know.

1350
01:45:10,929 --> 01:45:12,513
I've learned a lot about happiness.

1351
01:45:12,598 --> 01:45:16,475
And I've learned about unhappiness.

1352
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:18,477
And the thing
that makes me most unhappy

1353
01:45:18,562 --> 01:45:21,272
is the thought that
I might lose you.

1354
01:45:27,237 --> 01:45:29,906
And the thing that makes me
happiest is the thought

1355
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:31,991
that I could become the man
that you would want to spend

1356
01:45:32,075 --> 01:45:33,326
the rest of your life with.

1357
01:45:36,788 --> 01:45:38,372
Oh!

1358
01:45:47,466 --> 01:45:49,383
I miss my Hector.

1359
01:45:52,763 --> 01:45:56,349
I miss my Clara.

1360
01:46:02,689 --> 01:46:04,482
Hector, keep going.

1361
01:46:04,566 --> 01:46:06,359
You're knocking
it out of the park.

1362
01:46:06,443 --> 01:46:07,902
Who was that?

1363
01:46:07,986 --> 01:46:10,363
Uh, it's sock drawer,
but don't worry,

1364
01:46:10,447 --> 01:46:11,822
I'm locked inside
a metal booth.

1365
01:46:11,907 --> 01:46:13,866
Oh, good!
Skanky bitch.

1366
01:46:20,999 --> 01:46:23,334
Listen, I was
way out of line, you know,

1367
01:46:23,418 --> 01:46:25,836
saying that your job
was meaningless, you know.

1368
01:46:25,921 --> 01:46:29,590
Believe me, nobody does
meaningless like I do, you know.

1369
01:46:29,675 --> 01:46:31,259
I mean, that really
was the kettle

1370
01:46:31,343 --> 01:46:33,970
calling the pot black there,
you know.

1371
01:46:34,054 --> 01:46:36,639
Oh, wait, which way is it,
the pot or the kettle

1372
01:46:36,723 --> 01:46:39,100
- that calls the other one black?
- And why black?

1373
01:46:39,184 --> 01:46:41,018
What's that all about?

1374
01:46:41,103 --> 01:46:43,980
I know, right?

1375
01:46:44,064 --> 01:46:46,190
Does it even matter?

1376
01:46:46,275 --> 01:46:50,778
We matter, Clara.
We, you and me, we matter.

1377
01:46:56,868 --> 01:46:58,536
Yeah!

1378
01:47:03,875 --> 01:47:07,336
Is this call as good
as I think it is?

1379
01:47:09,047 --> 01:47:11,299
Yeah, I think it is.

1380
01:47:12,718 --> 01:47:15,219
Um, scary, but...

1381
01:47:16,471 --> 01:47:17,410
Yeah!

1382
01:48:11,318 --> 01:48:13,152
That's something else.

1383
01:48:13,236 --> 01:48:14,570
Which is it?
Which one is it?

1384
01:48:17,532 --> 01:48:19,408
It's all of them.

1385
01:48:23,038 --> 01:48:25,289
It's all of them.

1386
01:48:30,879 --> 01:48:33,672
It's the Aurora Borealis.
It's the Northern Lights.

1387
01:48:33,757 --> 01:48:36,467
It's all of them.
And isn't that the point?

1388
01:48:43,308 --> 01:48:45,518
Okay. I love you.

1389
01:48:45,602 --> 01:48:47,520
I love you, too.

1390
01:49:10,794 --> 01:49:13,420
Oh! Hector.

1391
01:49:13,505 --> 01:49:15,798
You're a warrior.

1392
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:19,510
Whew!

1393
01:49:24,266 --> 01:49:25,766
Would you take me
to the airport, please?

1394
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:30,229
Warrior.

1395
01:49:31,857 --> 01:49:33,566
Oh!

1396
01:49:36,027 --> 01:49:38,028
Oh, Jesus!

1397
01:49:38,947 --> 01:49:41,115
- Oh, I love you.
- I love you.

1398
01:49:41,199 --> 01:49:43,075
- Bye, bye, bye.
- I'll ship your bags.

1399
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:45,327
Go, go. Passport!

1400
01:50:01,928 --> 01:50:03,637
Oh, Hector!

1401
01:50:04,973 --> 01:50:07,766
How was your journey?
What did you learn?

1402
01:50:07,851 --> 01:50:12,479
It was amazing.
Amazing!

1403
01:50:12,564 --> 01:50:14,857
I am so ready to go home,

1404
01:50:14,941 --> 01:50:18,068
to get back to my girl,
my work.

1405
01:50:18,153 --> 01:50:19,445
I can't wait to tell
my patients.

1406
01:50:19,529 --> 01:50:21,197
Tell them what?

1407
01:50:21,281 --> 01:50:26,535
That we all, all of us
have the capacity to be happy.

1408
01:50:28,038 --> 01:50:29,955
Higher than that, Hector.

1409
01:50:33,501 --> 01:50:37,504
That we all have a right
to be happy?

1410
01:50:43,595 --> 01:50:45,304
Oh.

1411
01:50:47,349 --> 01:50:49,308
I see.

1412
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:52,728
We all have an obligation
to be happy.

1413
01:51:07,077 --> 01:51:09,286
Once upon a time,

1414
01:51:09,371 --> 01:51:12,873
there was a young psychiatrist
called Hector

1415
01:51:12,958 --> 01:51:15,834
who was very satisfied
with his life.

1416
01:51:15,919 --> 01:51:18,295
And far be it from me,
and forgive me for asking,

1417
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:19,546
and I don't mean to pry,

1418
01:51:19,631 --> 01:51:22,049
but can this plane
go any faster?

1419
01:51:35,272 --> 01:51:37,106
- It's me, it's me, it's me!
- Oh!

1420
01:51:39,442 --> 01:51:42,319
Oh. Oh.

1421
01:51:42,404 --> 01:51:44,154
His world was complex,

1422
01:51:44,239 --> 01:51:46,949
sometimes even chaotic.

1423
01:51:47,993 --> 01:51:49,076
- Oh-ho-ho!
- Ooh!

1424
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:51,662
Ah!

1425
01:51:51,746 --> 01:51:54,415
And he liked it that way.

1426
01:51:55,875 --> 01:52:01,046
He took comfort in the rich,
random patterns of his life.

1427
01:52:02,882 --> 01:52:04,633
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Oh, mate.

1428
01:52:04,718 --> 01:52:07,511
He listened to his
patients with real patience.

1429
01:52:11,474 --> 01:52:13,142
See what I mean?

1430
01:52:14,769 --> 01:52:16,979
Sometimes with surprising results.

1431
01:52:17,063 --> 01:52:19,690
It looks...
it looks acceptable.

1432
01:52:22,235 --> 01:52:25,738
Now then, Anjali,
beware the ego's need

1433
01:52:25,822 --> 01:52:27,656
for shaping hallucinations.

1434
01:52:27,741 --> 01:52:32,786
Huh, looks like somebody's ego shaped
a beautiful naked Chinese girl.

1435
01:52:35,206 --> 01:52:37,458
What?!

1436
01:52:37,542 --> 01:52:38,584
Mm-hmm.

1437
01:52:38,668 --> 01:52:40,753
- I... I won't pretend...
- That's right!

1438
01:52:40,837 --> 01:52:42,463
No more pretending.

1439
01:52:42,547 --> 01:52:44,214
Right!

1440
01:52:54,809 --> 01:52:58,562
Gotcha!

1441
01:52:58,646 --> 01:52:59,772
I'll get you back for that.

1442
01:53:04,444 --> 01:53:06,570
My girlfriend is coming.

1443
01:53:06,654 --> 01:53:09,239
Everything
was up for change...

1444
01:53:11,242 --> 01:53:13,869
including Hector.

1445
01:53:32,222 --> 01:53:39,520
And he learned to love
like he'd never loved before.
