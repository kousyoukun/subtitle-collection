You're breaking up with me,
aren't you?

No! No.

168
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,211
You can't just come out
with a question like that.

169
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,255
You have to build up to it.

You know you have
to have a preamble.

Alright, alright.
I'm sorry.

Do you consider yourself
to be happy?

Far be it from me,
and I...

177
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,693
Forgive me for asking,
and I don't mean to pry.

178
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:47,534
But... do you consider yourself
as a happy person?

179
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:51,538
Is this because I'm not ready
to be a mother?

180
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,540
- Other hand, please.
- Absolutely not.

- But I've only done the left one.
- Sorry.

This has nothing... nothing to do
with you not being a mother.

I know what you're saying, Hector.

knowing they'll never be happy.

Channel what's to come.
See the future. Yes.

188

- Give me your hand.

- Oh, not again.
- Please. Come on.

- Call it even.
- Cool.

192
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,579
But you are getting a bargain.
I charge more than you.

you should put up your fees.

Ah! The Indiana Jones

Alan, very nice to meet you.

1284

You, too!

1285
01:30:18,162 --> 01:30:21,748
Hector wants to know the secret
to a happy marriage.

1286
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:23,709
From a mathematician?

1287
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:28,755

- HECTOR: Oh, my God!

Hi!

1292
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:46,565
Hey, I'm in L.A.

1293
01:30:46,649 --> 01:30:49,484
I knew it.
You're with sock drawer.

1294
01:30:49,569 --> 01:30:51,778
- Sock drawer?
- That skank in the sock drawer.

1295
01:30:51,863 --> 01:30:55,490
In the photo, the one you've
kept hidden from me.

1296
01:30:55,575 --> 01:30:57,951
That's what this whole trip's
been all about, am I right?

1297
01:30:59,078 --> 01:31:01,455
Jesus, Clara,
she's not a skank, okay?

1298
01:31:01,539 --> 01:31:04,499
She's a psychologist.
Not to mention the pregnant mother

1299
01:31:04,584 --> 01:31:07,669
- of two beautiful children.
- Ouch!

1300
01:31:09,047 --> 01:31:11,089
That really hurt, Hector.
You know it did.

1301
01:31:11,174 --> 01:31:13,842
Look, she is my oldest friend,
alright?

1302
01:31:13,926 --> 01:31:15,927
What were you doing
in my sock drawer anyway?

other aspect of your life.

1305
01:31:22,226 --> 01:31:24,311
HECTOR: Maybe if you
didn't assume I needed

1306
01:31:24,395 --> 01:31:27,189
so much taking care of I could
get on taking care of myself.

1307
01:31:27,273 --> 01:31:28,774
You know what
smothering is, Clara?

1308
01:31:28,858 --> 01:31:30,942
It's mothering with an S.

1309
01:31:31,027 --> 01:31:33,904
Oh, that is the lamest
fucking thing I've ever heard.

1310
01:31:33,988 --> 01:31:35,739
You have paid for this.

1311
01:31:35,823 --> 01:31:37,449
Well, at least I don't make
a living making up

1312
01:31:37,533 --> 01:31:41,078
meaningless, manipulative names
of seriously dodgy drugs.

1313
01:31:43,373 --> 01:31:45,499
Is this call as bad
as I think it is?

1314
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:47,709
Yes.

1315
01:31:47,794 --> 01:31:49,086
Yes, I think it is.

1316
01:31:50,088 --> 01:31:51,380
Fine!

1317
01:31:51,464 --> 01:31:53,507
At last a decision.

1318
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:56,009
I can get on
with my meaningless life.

1319
01:31:56,094 --> 01:31:57,552

- How's things? How is she?
- Very good.

Uh, the Edulu Clinic, why?

I want to make a donation.
Anonymous, of course.

01:33:15,214 --> 01:33:16,298
Yes, I'm okay.

1343
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:20,510
How did the, uh,
call go with Clara?

01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:24,097
Oh, so horrendous.
Terminal.

1345
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:25,891
I'm sorry.

1346
01:33:25,975 --> 01:33:28,310
- You want to talk about it?
- Have we met?

1347
01:33:28,394 --> 01:33:29,811
Oh, right, you're Hector,
of course, you don't.

1348
01:33:29,896 --> 01:33:32,314
What was I thinking?

1349
01:33:32,398 --> 01:33:35,275
- Right, Agnes...
- Uh, yeah.

1350
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:36,568
I knew you were going to
ask me about this

1351
01:33:36,652 --> 01:33:38,820
- and I thought about it last night.
- Uh-huh.

1352
01:33:39,822 --> 01:33:44,868
I have never felt so happy, really.

1353
01:33:44,952 --> 01:33:48,663
Or exhausted. I mean, the chaos,
sometimes it's out of control.

1354
01:33:48,748 --> 01:33:50,624
But, you know,
I have a job I love

1355
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:54,711
and a husband I love
and two beautiful kids I love.

1356
01:33:54,796 --> 01:33:56,463
A home I love.

1357
01:33:56,547 --> 01:33:59,508
The only real shadow
on my happiness

1358
01:33:59,592 --> 01:34:02,552
is when I tell myself
it's too good to last.

1359
01:34:02,637 --> 01:34:06,473
And, Hector, the marriage,
whatever the marriage is,

1360
01:34:06,557 --> 01:34:08,934
the marriage itself
is never in question.

1361
01:34:09,018 --> 01:34:11,812
And that makes me happy.

1362
01:34:21,405 --> 01:34:22,531
What?

1363
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:27,202
I don't know, it's just...

1364
01:34:27,286 --> 01:34:28,620
You know...

1365
01:34:29,956 --> 01:34:31,581
Thinking about
what might have been.

1366
01:34:38,172 --> 01:34:39,172
What?

1367
01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:47,556
Agnes.

1368
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:49,516
- What?
- Never mind, forget it.

1369
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,851
It's not even worth discussing.

1370
01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:53,311
Oh, come on, what?

1371
01:34:53,396 --> 01:34:55,397
What might have been?
God!

1372
01:34:55,481 --> 01:34:58,233
How about what is right now?

1373
01:34:59,318 --> 01:35:02,696
It just suits you, doesn't it,
holding on to a fantasy?

1374
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:04,906
You know when you put someone
on a pedestal or on hold

1375
01:35:04,991 --> 01:35:06,908
or to the side or whatever
you want to call it.

1376
01:35:06,993 --> 01:35:08,410
Do you think
that's a compliment?

1377
01:35:08,494 --> 01:35:10,620
Because it's not.
It's the opposite.

1378
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:14,165
And you know why?
Because I am not that fantasy.

1379
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:16,835
I'm better than that fantasy.
I am real.

1380
01:35:16,919 --> 01:35:18,461
I got married.

1381
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:20,964
I had a baby,
and then another one,

1382
01:35:21,048 --> 01:35:22,549
and I'm having another one.

1383
01:35:22,633 --> 01:35:24,175
And do you think I wanted
it to be Hector there

1384
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:27,304
cutting the umbilical cord?
No, because Hector

1385
01:35:27,388 --> 01:35:31,558
would throw up and then faint
because you're squeamish.

1386
01:35:31,642 --> 01:35:34,477
You're emotionally squeamish.

1387
01:35:34,562 --> 01:35:37,230
You really are some kind
of weird psychiatrist,

1388
01:35:37,315 --> 01:35:39,608
- you know that, right?
- I... Where's...

1389
01:35:39,692 --> 01:35:44,237
Oh, I'm trying so hard here to
avoid the words "move"and "on",

1390
01:35:44,322 --> 01:35:46,323
but, for crying out loud,
I am just,

1391
01:35:46,407 --> 01:35:49,826
"Oh, flag that woman for,
I don't know, 12 years.

1392
01:35:49,911 --> 01:35:51,912
Yeah, get back to that one
when the time's right."

1393
01:35:51,996 --> 01:35:54,080
So, nothing, nothing,
nothing, nothing,

1394
01:35:54,165 --> 01:35:56,958
then, "Hi! I'm in Africa.
See you Monday."

1395
01:35:57,043 --> 01:35:59,419
I mean, I'm just some kind of
box you had to check, aren't I?

1396
01:35:59,503 --> 01:36:01,087
No...

1397
01:36:14,101 --> 01:36:15,727
I did love you, Hector.

1398
01:36:20,942 --> 01:36:23,693
But I love Alan now.

1399
01:36:25,529 --> 01:36:27,781
Guess what?

1400
01:36:27,865 --> 01:36:31,701
Whatever it is you think
you're in love with...

1401
01:36:31,786 --> 01:36:32,460
it's not me.

1402
01:37:02,984 --> 01:37:06,194
I know what you're thinking,
how much do researchers make?

1403

1404
01:37:07,989 --> 01:37:09,990

is going up...

(CHUCKLING)

1406
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:15,120
yet happiness is going down.

1407
01:37:15,204 --> 01:37:18,289
Oh, dear, oh, dear,
oh, dear, oh, dear.

1408
01:37:18,374 --> 01:37:22,252
How many of us, I wonder,
can recall

1409
01:37:22,336 --> 01:37:27,257
a childhood moment
when we experienced happiness

1410
01:37:27,341 --> 01:37:29,092
as a state of being?

1411
01:37:29,176 --> 01:37:32,929
That single moment
of untarnished joy.

1412
01:37:33,014 --> 01:37:39,644
That moment when everything
in our world inside and out...

1413
01:37:41,313 --> 01:37:43,857
was alright.

1414
01:37:43,941 --> 01:37:47,152
Everything was alright.

1415
01:37:51,031 --> 01:37:54,200
But, now, we become
a colony of adults

1416
01:37:54,285 --> 01:37:57,579
and everything is all wrong
all the time.

1417
01:37:57,663 --> 01:37:58,913
(CHUCKLING)

1418
01:37:58,998 --> 01:38:03,460
It's as if we were on a quest
to get it back,

1419
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:06,713
and yet the more we focus
on our own personal happiness,

1420
01:38:06,797 --> 01:38:08,715
the more it eludes us.

1421
01:38:08,799 --> 01:38:12,385
In fact, it's only when
we are otherwise engaged,

1422
01:38:12,470 --> 01:38:16,681
you know, focused, absorbed,
inspired, communicating,

1423
01:38:16,766 --> 01:38:19,934
discovering, learning,
dancing, for heaven's sake,

1424
01:38:20,019 --> 01:38:25,565
that we experience happiness
as a by-product, a side effect.

1425
01:38:25,649 --> 01:38:26,858
Oh, no.

1426
01:38:26,942 --> 01:38:28,818
We should concern ourselves

1427
01:38:28,903 --> 01:38:31,905
not so much with the pursuit
of happiness,

1428
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:35,325
but with the happiness
of pursuit.

1429
01:38:36,118 --> 01:38:40,622
But how do we
measure happiness?

1430
01:38:40,706 --> 01:38:43,500
Emotions are like colors, you know.

1431
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:48,421
Difficult to explain once
but not now, not anymore.

1432
01:38:48,506 --> 01:38:52,550
All those who read auras,
step aside,

1433
01:38:52,635 --> 01:38:54,719
- this is science.

(LAUGHTER)

1438
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:10,485
My portal into the mysterious
minutiae of human emotions.

1439
01:39:10,569 --> 01:39:13,279
Emotions that
for the very first time,

1440
01:39:13,364 --> 01:39:18,034
we can separate, specify
and quantify in actual units.

1441
01:39:18,118 --> 01:39:21,037
Now, this male subject
is Japanese.

1442
01:39:21,121 --> 01:39:23,540
Look at the abundance
of bright orange

1443
01:39:23,624 --> 01:39:27,585
around the happiness area,
verging on ecstasy.

1444
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:30,547
It's as if the brain
was smiling.

1445
01:39:30,631 --> 01:39:33,716
Cause, half a liter
of warm sake.

1446
01:39:33,801 --> 01:39:35,343
(LAUGHTER)

1447
01:39:35,427 --> 01:39:37,637
And here we go again,
same Japanese gentleman,

1448
01:39:37,721 --> 01:39:39,848
eleven hours later,

1449
01:39:39,932 --> 01:39:44,435
the color of grim despondency,
verging on suicide,

1450
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:47,522
otherwise known
as an excruciating hangover.

1451
01:39:47,606 --> 01:39:51,985
Ask yourselves,
is this worth that?

1452
01:39:52,069 --> 01:39:53,778
(APPLAUSE)

1453
01:39:56,574 --> 01:39:59,617
Oh, thank you!
You first, Agnes.

1454
01:39:59,702 --> 01:40:02,662
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Oh, yes, we made a deal.

1455
01:40:02,746 --> 01:40:04,998
Off you go into
the isolation booth.

1456
01:40:05,082 --> 01:40:06,583
Helmet on.

1457
01:40:06,667 --> 01:40:09,335
I want you to imagine yourself
in three situations.

1458
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:12,088
One that makes you
very happy, one very sad,

1459
01:40:12,172 --> 01:40:15,216
and one very scared.
Recent memories can be useful.

1460
01:40:15,384 --> 01:40:19,554
Do not tell me the order,
I will guess it myself.

1461
01:40:21,599 --> 01:40:23,474
They say I'm a mind reader.

1462
01:40:23,559 --> 01:40:24,767
It's a bloody lie, I'm not.

1463
01:40:24,852 --> 01:40:28,688
I'm just a good diagnostician
with an awesome toy.

1464
01:40:32,484 --> 01:40:34,235
COREMAN: Ready when you are.

1465
01:40:50,252 --> 01:40:51,544
Out you come.

1466
01:40:55,466 --> 01:40:58,009
As I thought,
you're an open book.

1467
01:40:58,093 --> 01:40:59,719
Sad, scared, happy
in that order.

1468
01:40:59,803 --> 01:41:02,597
- Final answer.
- Wow, yeah!

1469
01:41:02,681 --> 01:41:06,351
- You're good.
- Your turn, Hector.

1470
01:41:06,435 --> 01:41:08,102
Um, you know what,
I think I'm gonna...

1471
01:41:08,187 --> 01:41:10,855
- Your turn, Hector.
- Okay.

1472
01:41:11,982 --> 01:41:14,442
Get over yourself.
You weren't in any of mine.

1473
01:41:14,526 --> 01:41:16,444
Oh, right.

1474
01:41:16,528 --> 01:41:18,321
Sit, my dear.

1475
01:41:20,532 --> 01:41:23,117
By way of identifying
the emotions,

1476
01:41:23,202 --> 01:41:26,621
I've assigned a color to each
corresponding part of the brain.

1477
01:41:26,705 --> 01:41:28,081
It's pretty obvious, really.

1478
01:41:28,165 --> 01:41:30,750
Sunny yellow, happy,
ice blue, sad,

1479
01:41:30,834 --> 01:41:34,212
battery-acid green, fear.

1480
01:41:34,296 --> 01:41:37,006
It corrodes you, you know.

1481
01:41:43,389 --> 01:41:44,931
PROFESSOR COREMAN: Right.

1482
01:41:45,015 --> 01:41:47,517
Sad, scared, happy,
don't tell me the order,

1483
01:41:47,601 --> 01:41:48,935
and be specific.

1484
01:41:49,019 --> 01:41:50,645
It's all about specificity.

1485
01:41:56,318 --> 01:41:58,027
(SHOUTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

1486
01:41:58,112 --> 01:42:01,155
- Shut up!
- Stop, please!

1487
01:42:08,288 --> 01:42:10,331
That's odd.

1488
01:42:10,416 --> 01:42:14,293
It's as if he's filtering,
moderating his feelings.

1489
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:18,172
Something's holding him back,
some kind of barrier.

1490
01:42:28,767 --> 01:42:32,562
No, no, no, these are not
the emotions of a grown man.

1491
01:42:32,646 --> 01:42:33,980
Tell me about it.

1492
01:42:34,064 --> 01:42:35,732
He's going to have
to dig a lot deeper.

1493
01:42:35,816 --> 01:42:38,735
There is no deeper.

1494
01:42:38,819 --> 01:42:40,903
PROFESSOR COREMAN: I must admit,
I'm a little baffled.

1495
01:42:40,988 --> 01:42:45,408
Hi, this is Hector.
I think I can go deeper.

1496
01:42:45,492 --> 01:42:47,452
Oh, fuck,
we left the mic on.

1497
01:42:47,536 --> 01:42:48,536
Oh, well.

1498
01:42:49,788 --> 01:42:51,914
I think I know where to go.

1499
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:55,460
Courage, Hector,
we're right there with you.

1500
01:43:50,557 --> 01:43:52,975
(PHONE RINGING)

1501
01:44:04,655 --> 01:44:07,949
This is Hector,
who the hell is this?

1502
01:44:10,828 --> 01:44:15,081
(CLARA SOBBING)
I wanted to be a mother.

1503
01:44:15,165 --> 01:44:18,417
Just...

1504
01:44:18,502 --> 01:44:21,087
Just not yours.

1505
01:44:22,881 --> 01:44:27,176
Clara, um, listen,
don't go anywhere, okay?

1506
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:29,762
Just... just stay there, okay?
Hang on.

1507
01:44:29,847 --> 01:44:32,682
Professor, can we stop?
I need to take this call.

1508
01:44:32,766 --> 01:44:35,643
Alright.
Please, please.

1509
01:44:35,727 --> 01:44:38,104
Uh, Clara, Clara,
are you still there?

1510
01:44:39,314 --> 01:44:43,192
- Yes, I'm here, yeah.
- HECTOR: Thank, God!

1511
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:45,820
Clara, listen.

1512
01:44:52,870 --> 01:44:55,246
I'm sorry I didn't give you
any explanation

1513
01:44:55,330 --> 01:45:00,376
for this insane journey,
but the truth is,

1514
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:03,421
I didn't really have
any reasons of my own.

1515
01:45:03,505 --> 01:45:06,799
I didn't explain it to myself.

1516
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:10,845
(STAMMERING) I have
learned a lot, you know.

1517
01:45:10,929 --> 01:45:12,513
I've learned a lot about happiness.

1518
01:45:12,598 --> 01:45:16,475
And I've learned about unhappiness.

1519
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:18,477
And the thing
that makes me most unhappy

1520
01:45:18,562 --> 01:45:21,272
is the thought that
I might lose you.

1521
01:45:27,237 --> 01:45:29,906
And the thing that makes me
happiest is the thought

1522
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:31,991
that I could become the man
that you would want to spend

1523
01:45:32,075 --> 01:45:33,326
the rest of your life with.

1524
01:45:36,788 --> 01:45:38,372
Oh!

1525
01:45:47,466 --> 01:45:49,383
I miss my Hector.

1526
01:45:52,763 --> 01:45:56,349
I miss my Clara.

Hector, keep going.

AGNES: You're knocking
it out of the park.

1529
01:46:06,443 --> 01:46:07,902
Who was that?

1530
01:46:07,986 --> 01:46:10,363
Uh, it's sock drawer,
but don't worry,

1531
01:46:10,447 --> 01:46:11,822
I'm locked inside
a metal booth.

1532
01:46:11,907 --> 01:46:13,866
Oh, good!
Skanky bitch.

(LAUGHING)

1534
01:46:20,999 --> 01:46:23,334
Listen, I was
way out of line, you know,

1535
01:46:23,418 --> 01:46:25,836
saying that your job
was meaningless, you know.

1536
01:46:25,921 --> 01:46:29,590
Believe me, nobody does
meaningless like I do, you know.

1537
01:46:29,675 --> 01:46:31,259
I mean, that really
was the kettle

1538
01:46:31,343 --> 01:46:33,970
calling the pot black there,
you know.

1539
01:46:34,054 --> 01:46:36,639
Oh, wait, which way is it,
the pot or the kettle

1540
01:46:36,723 --> 01:46:39,100
- that calls the other one black?
- And why black?

1541
01:46:39,184 --> 01:46:41,018
What's that all about?

1542
01:46:41,103 --> 01:46:43,980
I know, right?

1543
01:46:44,064 --> 01:46:46,190
Does it even matter?

1544
01:46:46,275 --> 01:46:50,778
We matter, Clara.
We, you and me, we matter.

1545
01:46:56,868 --> 01:46:58,536
Yeah!
(LAUGHING)

1546
01:47:03,875 --> 01:47:07,336
Is this call as good
as I think it is?

1547
01:47:09,047 --> 01:47:11,299
Yeah, I think it is.

1548
01:47:12,718 --> 01:47:15,219
Um, scary, but...

01:47:16,471 --> 01:47:17,410
Yeah!

Which is it?
Which one is it?

1552
01:48:17,532 --> 01:48:19,408
It's all of them.

1553
01:48:23,038 --> 01:48:25,289
It's all of them.

1554

It's the Aurora Borealis.
It's the Northern Lights.

1555
01:48:33,757 --> 01:48:36,467
It's all of them.
And isn't that the point?

1556
01:48:43,308 --> 01:48:45,518
Okay. I love you.

What did you learn?

1572
01:50:07,851 --> 01:50:12,479
(STAMMERING) It was amazing.
Amazing!

1573
01:50:12,564 --> 01:50:14,857
I am so ready to go home,

1574

to get back to my girl,
my work.

1575
01:50:18,153 --> 01:50:19,445
I can't wait to tell
my patients.

1576
01:50:19,529 --> 01:50:21,197
Tell them what?

1577
01:50:21,281 --> 01:50:26,535
That we all, all of us
have the capacity to be happy.

1578
01:50:28,038 --> 01:50:29,955
Higher than that, Hector.

1579
01:50:33,501 --> 01:50:37,504
That we all have a right
to be happy?

1580

Oh.

His world was complex,

1594
01:51:44,239 --> 01:51:46,949
sometimes even chaotic.

1595
01:51:47,993 --> 01:51:49,076
- Oh-ho-ho!
- Ooh!

1596
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:51,662
Ah!

1597
01:51:51,746 --> 01:51:54,415
NARRATOR:
And he liked it that way.

1598
01:51:55,875 --> 01:52:01,046
He took comfort in the rich,
random patterns of his life.

1599
01:52:02,882 --> 01:52:04,633
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Oh, mate.

1600
01:52:04,718 --> 01:52:07,511
NARRATOR: He listened to his
patients with real patience.

(LAUGHING)

1602
01:52:11,474 --> 01:52:13,142
NARRATOR: See what I mean?

1603
01:52:14,769 --> 01:52:16,979
Sometimes with surprising results.

1604
01:52:17,063 --> 01:52:19,690
It looks...
it looks acceptable.

1605
01:52:22,235 --> 01:52:25,738
Now then, Anjali,
beware the ego's need

1606
01:52:25,822 --> 01:52:27,656
for shaping hallucinations.

1607
01:52:27,741 --> 01:52:32,786
Huh, looks like somebody's ego shaped
a beautiful naked Chinese girl.

1608
01:52:35,206 --> 01:52:37,458
What?!

1609
01:52:37,542 --> 01:52:38,584
Mm-hmm.

1610
01:52:38,668 --> 01:52:40,753
- I... I won't pretend...
- That's right!

1611
01:52:40,837 --> 01:52:42,463
No more pretending.

1612
01:52:42,547 --> 01:52:44,214
Right!

1613
01:52:52,891 --> 01:52:54,725
(EXCLAIMING)

1614
01:52:54,809 --> 01:52:58,562
Gotcha!
(LAUGHING)

1615
01:52:58,646 --> 01:52:59,772
I'll get you back for that.

1616
01:53:04,444 --> 01:53:06,570
My girlfriend is coming.

1617
01:53:06,654 --> 01:53:09,239
NARRATOR: Everything
was up for change...

1618
01:53:11,242 --> 01:53:13,869
including Hector.

1619
01:53:32,222 --> 01:53:39,520
And he learned to love
like he'd never loved before.
