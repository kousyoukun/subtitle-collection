1
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,199
Clara.

2
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,622
Hector!

3
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,379
Morning, sweetheart.
- Morning.

4
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,541
Time to rise, time to shine!

5
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,760
Once upon a time there was a young psychiatrist called Hector,

6
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,643
who had a very satisfactory life.

7
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,145
His world was tidy,

8
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,276
uncomplicated.

9
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,948
And he liked it that way.

10
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:00,370
He took great comfort in its predictable patterns.

11
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:07,832
Patterns, his girlfriend Clara was happy to maintain.

12
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,756
Thank you. Bye.

13
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,682
Any lapse was swiftly rectified.

14
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,344
TINTIN
THE BLUE LOTUS

15
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,809
Hector had a great deal of patience for his patients,

16
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,269
if you see what i mean.

17
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:08,104
Everyday I ask myself:
How could my marriege just explode the way it did?

18
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,269
And, like all the best psychiatrists,

19
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,355
he knew how to answer a question with a question.

20
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:17,402
Jane,
what does "exploding" mean to you?

21
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:22,540
It's no good! I've lost my psyhcic mojo. I just can't see a way out.

22
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,750
All my clients leave me.

23
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,081
Hector, look at me, I want the truth.

24
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,300
Do you see my light? Here?

25
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,924
Please don't lie to me.

26
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,221
I see your point.

27
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,808
His patients never crossed paths with each other.

28
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,689
They couldn't.

29
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:54,029
Once in a while, Hector prescribed pills with funny sounding names. 

30
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,153
Roger,
have you taken your meds?

31
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,445
I am a fucking Ferrari!
- What?

32
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:04,035
Experimenting until he'll end it upon the one most suitable.

33
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:07,706
Roger
- Two fat ladies, 88!

34
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,421
His clients always returned.

35
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:15,668
They gave his name to their friends, who gave his name to their friends.

36
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:23,975
After all, Hector's rates were very fair. They haven't changed in years.

37
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:30,187
Come to think of it. Neither had Hector.

38
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,986
And if that wasn't enough.

39
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:39,108
Within six days, our Clara discovers the name for a companion drug,

40
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:43,449
which had eluded the marketing department for six months.

41
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,572
Now that's the talent for words!

42
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,909
But what I love most about her,

43
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,537
is that in the ten years she has been with us,

44
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:56,171
she has yet to discover the words "maternity" or "leave".

45
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,640
Thank you all so much!

46
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,312
What's in a name?
Glamour of hope?

47
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:15,315
A chance for change.
- That's right. - A way to alleviate suffering.

48
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,901
It's been five years since we launched Tranquiline.

49
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:23,201
Correction. No, it's been a lifetime for those who benefited from it.

50
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,197
From me emotional, to marketing.

51
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,875
I love you guys!
Here is to making a difference!

52
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,243
To making money!

53
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,430
Not me! Not me!

54
00:07:49,188 --> 00:07:50,261
Come on!

55
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,390
Give her some money!

56
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,439
Twenty pounds!

57
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,064
Hinreißend!

58
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,404
What should I do?

59
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,628
Sie faszinieren mich. Wie heißen Sie?

60
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:19,296
You are not working with these people?

61
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,427
No, no.
I'm Hector. I am a psychiatrist.

62
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,256
Psychiatrist!

63
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,099
You can help me?

64
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,517
I think not!

65
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,228
But I want a penis.

66
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,308
A penis.
- You mean happiness!

67
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:41,276
Everybody want a penis,
but you cannot hold a penis.

68
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:46,410
Yes, sorry. It's elusive, yes.
You can't touch happiness.

69
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:50,994
You cannot touch a penis.

70
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,460
Hinreißend!

71
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:57,962
Hector!

72
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:03,927
I want a penis in my bottom of the heart.

73
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:07,514
No, no. You want happiness, from the bottom of your heart.

74
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,976
That is what I said. A penis.

75
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,562
In my bottom.

76
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,522
Stop it!

77
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,194
Oh, Gosh!

78
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:28,239
I love my Hector.
- I love my Clara.

79
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,698
No, I mean it.

80
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:33,282
I love my weird, eccentric,

81
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,827
nobody is like him Hector.

82
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,788
Promise me, you'll never change.

83
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,885
Thank you for humoring all my friends.

84
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,132
You know, I would do the same for you.

85
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,850
I don't have any friends.
- Of course you do, Hector.

86
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,988
Back off Malcolm, that's not funny.

87
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,334
HECTOR SOCKS

88
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,073
Give me your hand.

89
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,120
No, see? Nichts! Nothing!

90
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:02,333
I can still, you know, talk the talk like you do, Hector.

91
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,048
Like the way you answer a question with a question.

92
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,541
What do you mean?

93
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,628
There, that's it.

94
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,051
You are so transparent, Hector.

95
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,178
Am I?
-You have your noncommittal nonsense,

96
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:18,270
I have my New-Age-Waffle,
I can serve up to any client.

97
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,773
"Your mother had a hard life"
Tell me what mother hasn't has a hard life?

98
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,065
Or "You are going on a journey."
I feel like a fraud.

99
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,617
Don't tell me you don't know what I am talking about.

100
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:40,705
Every day, just going through the motions, never been authentic.

101
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:42,915
Authentic!

102
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:49,168
You know what, Anjali? I think this represents some sort of growth.

103
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,508
You know, just be careful that when you have

104
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,803
these visions, hallucinations,

105
00:11:56,174 --> 00:12:00,179
that the ego might just be shaping them to its own needs.

106
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:06,355
Let's try the medication for another week, shall we?

107
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,531
Aber der Tumor war gutartig?

108
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,241
Ja, nein, ja.

109
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,119
Nein.
- Ja oder nein?

110
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,242
Ja.

111
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,117
Also

112
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,956
this is not even a cancer story.

113
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,552
Hector,

114
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,184
you seem a little blue, not your usual self.

115
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,144
Is it Roger?

116
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:50,237
No, no. Actually, Ben, it's my other patients.

117
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,739
You know, they all like to think they are hopeless.

118
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,946
That's hopeless.

119
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,657
Are you happy?

120
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,458
You are breaking up with me, aren't you?
- No!

121
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:15,428
You can't come up with a question like that, you have to build up to it.

122
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,007
You know you have to have a preamble.
- Alright, alright, I'm sorry.

123
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,261
Do you consider yourself to be happy?

124
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,181
Alright, look.

125
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,608
I've got it.

126
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:34,231
Far be it from me, and forgive me for asking,

127
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,277
and I don't mean to pry, but

128
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,243
do you consider yourself as

129
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,949
a happy person?

130
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,412
Is this cause I am not ready to be a mother? Other hand, please.

131
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,877
Absolutely not.
- But you don't have any on the left one.

132
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:57,049
Sorry. This is nothing, nothing to do with you not being a mother.

133
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,799
I know what you're saying, Hector.

134
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:08,189
Noone wants to live with a person who will never be happy.

135
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,316
So you are...
- Back in business, yes.

136
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:19,109
And you can...
- Channel what's to come. See the future, yes.

137
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,861
Give me your hand.
- No, not again!

138
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,996
Please! Come on!

139
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:27,705
Wait, are we off the clock?
- Call it a day. - Cool.

140
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:31,080
But you are getting a bargain. I charge more than you. I'm telling you,

141
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,922
you should put up your fees.

142
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,595
You're going on a journey.

143
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:41,339
Ja?

144
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,102
Be serious.

145
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,395
I am. You are.

146
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,272
To distant lands.

147
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,194
What is... Anything else?

148
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,614
I see you at peace. I see you happy.

149
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,362
Really?

150
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,034
I see you loving like you have never loved before.

151
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,545
Yeah, well.

152
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,211
Maybe in my next life.
- Hector,

153
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,713
this is your next life.

154
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,760
I see you with a dead dog. - What?
- You are a little boy, you are crying.

155
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,762
Oh my god, you were an only child,

156
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:32,061
a lonely child you poor thing.
No, it makes sense.

157
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,064
Your life, how exhausting.

158
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,646
I see a girl on a beach.
- What do you mean a girl?

159
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,156
Why didn't you ever call her?
- What do you mean, call her?

160
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,692
Are you sterile?
- No, I am not sterile!

161
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:46,700
No, no, wait, that's not it. It's your life.
Why am I getting sterility?

162
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:52,160
Someone is hurting you, making you angry.
- Time's up. - It's you.

163
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,626
It's you. You are making you angry.
- This session... Just stop, ok, stop!

164
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,500
Stop projecting.
I am not the patient here, Anjali.

165
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,219
So exhausting, exhausting.
- Yes, yes, yes, so exhausting. I know, I know.

166
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,714
Exhausting.
- Thank you, I'll see you next week. Thank you.

167
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,179
Who is Agnes?

168
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,398
I can't sell the house. The cracks are back.

169
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,068
They had taken it off the menu, the evening was ruined.

170
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,370
The only reason to go there was the white pie.

171
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,562
I'm thinking of taking in other people's laundry.

172
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,563
To get some extra cash, to help pay for the nanny.

173
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,447
Otherwise we are going under.

174
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,612
I was doing the exercises but I fell asleep.

175
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,913
And now the sergeant says I am not standing straight.

176
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,704
Nobody bought me a birthday
- present I actually wanted.

177
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,457
I bought him odor away...
- ... but his feet really are a problem.

178
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:39,086
Nippels just aren't an erogenous zone for men.

179
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,459
I'm gonna have to cut the nanny down to five days a week.

180
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,963
It is a losing battle.
- I am at the end of my rope.

181
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,735
Am Ende?

182
00:16:56,852 --> 00:16:59,446
Das nennen Sie am Ende sein?
Ein Kind,

183
00:16:59,554 --> 00:17:00,609
I'll give you a rope.

184
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:05,010
A child, witnessing his parents gunned down in a drive by shooting.

185
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:05,610
That is a rope.

186
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:09,321
A midwife, in Africa, trying to deliver babies with no running water.

187
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,704
That is a rope.

188
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:14,268
TinTin, literally, at the end of his rope.

189
00:17:14,476 --> 00:17:15,875
Does he cut the rope to save his own life,

190
00:17:15,876 --> 00:17:18,670
or does he hold on to stop his friend from falling to a certain death?

191
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:21,371
Cut the rope, TinTin, cut the rope!

192
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,803
Jane! Jane!

193
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:30,634
I'm sorry.
I'm very very sorry.

194
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,219
I don't know what came over me.

195
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,392
Same time next week?

196
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,230
I have to take my daughter sailing for a couple of days.

197
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,610
Yes, yes I do remember. You were mentioning that. So, following week?

198
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:46,907
Still won't be back.

199
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,365
You said a couple of days.

200
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:51,745
Yes.

201
00:17:54,699 --> 00:18:00,206
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

202
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,926
This is not a couple of days, ok,
this is ten days holiday, Jane!

203
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:06,715
Fucking own it!

204
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,070
Malcolm.

205
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,867
Malcolm, you stupid bastard.

206
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,030
Give me the fucking remote!
Give me that!

207
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:41,792
Jackass!

208
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,173
"Euphoralan"?

209
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,800
"Solarton"?

210
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:56,177
As in "a ton of sun".

211
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:59,306
"Apollonax"?
No, that's the wrong list.

212
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,349
No, that's funny,
that's for August.

213
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,109
Erectile dysfunction.

214
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,061
What do you think?

215
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:08,155
"Apollonax"? Apollo und seine Axt?

216
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,660
I need to get away.

217
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,791
Take a trip.

218
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:24,459
I'm not making my patients any happier,
and I just...

219
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,299
I need to do some research.

220
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,626
On what?

221
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,511
Happiness.

222
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,346
Otherwise I can't help.

223
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,175
Look at my life, Clara.

224
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,349
I feel like such a fraud.
You know, like a...

225
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,936
An armchair traveller
dishing out worldly advice.

226
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,612
When?
- Soon, very soon. Now.

227
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,275
You know, there is no way I can get the time off,
I mean not now.

228
00:19:51,276 --> 00:19:54,076
Not this time of the year.

229
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:56,828
I know.

230
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,795
I'm sorry.

231
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,540
Okay, I am sorry.
I really, really am.

232
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,627
Will you be here when I get back?

233
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,838
How long will you be gone?

234
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,350
I don't know.

235
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,764
Then I can't answer the question,
can I?

236
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,278
Ich glaube, Sie haben recht,

237
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:37,412
I think I just went slightly off the map with the all TinTin reference.

238
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,447
Now don't get me wrong.

239
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,995
There is real value to your inner TinTin.

240
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,745
My what?

241
00:20:43,846 --> 00:20:46,746
Your inner TinTin.
The boy scout in you.

242
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,997
Don't ever lose it.

243
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,921
It is just a...
How can I put this.

244
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,846
Just as long as TinTin isn't driving the bus.

245
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:01,727
Where are you thinking of going on this journey of yours?
- I was thinking China.

246
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,355
China!

247
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:11,904
Brilliant!

248
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,903
Sleeves, removable.
- Obviously.

249
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,611
Trousers, convertible.
- Obviously. - Hat,

250
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,704
reversable.
- Obviously.

251
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,788
And in case of emergencies.
- God forbid!

252
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,787
Passport, Imodium,
Antihistamine, nose strips

253
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:29,914
Remember, avoid dairy.
- Yes.

254
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:34,419
Got enough socks?
- Yes, I think so.

255
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,053
I don't wanna over pack it.

256
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,006
And you know, it all fits.

257
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,680
Neat and tidy. Like us.

258
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,141
What's like us?

259
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:46,977
Tidy.

260
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,435
It's like who we are, tidy.

261
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:54,822
It's like that's our agreement, isn't it?

262
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,112
Hector.

263
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,695
I get it.

264
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,244
If you're gonna do this, do it totally.

265
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:05,871
Make it worthwhile.

266
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,536
You have my permission, alright?

267
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,462
Really?

268
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,211
Really. I mean it.

269
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,543
Totally.

270
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,339
Come here, Sir.

271
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:33,610
Arms up please, Sir.

272
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:50,086
You sit in my seat.
- Pardon?

273
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:54,002
I make in internet booking weeks ago.
- I don't know. What are you? 39G?

274
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,841
Should he go on my lap?

275
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,052
Look, there is obviously some sort of mixup.
I'll do whatever you want.

276
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,138
Let me go and check.

277
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,967
This way, Sir.

278
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:08,016
Your seat.
- Okay.

279
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:09,809
Great.

280
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,150
Sorry, could you move your bags? Sorry.
- Champagne, Sir?

281
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,311
Is the Pope circumcised?

282
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,692
What do you mean?

283
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:26,781
Can I please get the champagne for first class at least? Decent one.

284
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,162
I doubt that.
- This isn't decent?

285
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,919
Down or memory-foam?
- What? - The pillow.

286
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:35,665
Did you order memory-foam?
- I forget. Did I?

287
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:38,505
Sorry, it's my little joke.
- I'm sorry, Sir,

288
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:41,425
I'm going to need to store your bag.
- Of course. Please do.

289
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,264
Sorry.

290
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,271
I got it.
Oh, God, it's like Twister..

291
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,023
You won.

292
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:57,941
Thank you.

293
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,038
That's sweet.

294
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:14,332
Look at that.
HECTOR'S SEARCH FOR HAPPINESS
A JOURNEY

295
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,631
It's a gift. It's from my other half.

296
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,751
She must have smuggled it into my bag.

297
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,093
"Fill these pages."

298
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,384
I will.

299
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,972
Anything from duty-free, Sir?
- Yes, please, actually.

300
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,967
I'd like the "Keep it handy travel candy" please.

301
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,936
Immigration form?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

302
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:33,207
Give it back. Costed more than your car.
- Thank you.

303
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,751
Sorry.
- Don't worry, Sir.

304
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:44,423
The glass is unbreakable.
- Very clever, unbreakable.

305
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:49,973
Unbreakable.

306
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,397
Sorry.

307
00:25:58,015 --> 00:26:01,394
Are you sure there is no room in first class?
- Sorry, Sir.

308
00:26:10,095 --> 00:26:14,691
1. MAKING COMPARISONS CAN SPOIL YOUR HAPPINESS

309
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:31,848
Wife?

310
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:35,936
Old flame. University.
- We all got one of those.

311
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,938
First time in China?

312
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,516
Yeah.
- Business or pleasure?

313
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:44,191
Research, actually. I'm a psychiatrist.

314
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:47,732
I want to know what makes people happy.

315
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:06,212
Hector.

316
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,090
Edward.

317
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,297
Watch yourself.
- Okay.

318
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,271
Thank you.

319
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,984
He fucking has got my fucking pen!

320
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:33,360
Edward! I still have your pen!

321
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,577
I'm fine, I'm fine. Alright.

322
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:39,746
Wait!

323
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,381
I can't thank you enough.
- Where are you staying?

324
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,967
The Marriot.
- The Marriott, for happy?

325
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,007
Well, it was central.

326
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,505
What, you've got any other suggestions?

327
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,387
Let me show you happy.

328
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,572
Whoever said "Money can't buy happiness",

329
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,244
fuck you!

330
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:02,033
This is incredible, this is incredible!
Just incredible! The whole thing, the meal, my room,

331
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,875
Edward, I'm just, I'm curious, okay.

332
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:09,128
Far be it from me, and forgive me for asking,
and I don't mean to pry,

333
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,167
Time is money, spit it out!
- Right, are you happy?

334
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,965
When you work as much as I do, you don't have time to ask yourself that question.

335
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,719
And that's why I'm thinking of quitting.

336
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,768
What, now?
- God, no. In another 20 million.

337
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,518
I have been saying that for the last 100 million.

338
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:27,767
You bust the god, you earn enough money,

339
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,400
you retire, you do something you like.

340
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,533
Or nothing at all.
- And then you are happy?

341
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:43,032
Yeah. Or addicted, divorced or dead.

342
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:44,790
What the hell.

343
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:52,591
You pick a goal, you work towards it,
makes you feel better.

344
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,551
Just keep moving, that's my motto.

345
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:57,554
Maybe there is only one way to retire and be happy.

346
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,298
And what's that?

347
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,550
Don't retire!

348
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:08,141
It's time for some real China. Come on.
- Really? Okay.

349
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,109
I just take a bit of this.

350
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:17,324
It's not what you know, actually. It's not who you know.

351
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,532
It's how much you pay, who you know.

352
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,888
Hey, Minnie! How are you?

353
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,810
Hey, Jens. - Hey, Edward.
- I thought you'd be back to Berlin!

354
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,400
This is Valerie, she's from Paris.

355
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,571
What are you doing?

356
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,663
I'm...
- Are you a writer?

357
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,333
No, Im' just, I'm taking some notes.

358
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:21,047
"2. A lot of people think, happiness means being richer,

359
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,884
or more important."

360
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,849
Do you believe that?
- Well, I wouldn't know,

361
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,188
I'm not rich and I'm not important.

362
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:34,359
What a coincidence, neither am I.

363
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,022
"The search for happiness."

364
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,160
Is it, Ancona?

365
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:46,280
No.

366
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,242
Perhaps, over there.

367
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:55,377
No, no, no. That's torture for me,
I don't dance. - Why not?

368
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:59,001
You don't like move your body a little bit?

369
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:02,505
Come on, it's fun.
- You know what, it's...

370
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:07,639
Or, is it right here?

371
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,762
In your smile.

372
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,444
My name is Ying Li. I am a student.

373
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,943
Hector.

374
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:24,117
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

375
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,283
Oh, sorry, too long.

376
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,912
So, what do you study, Ying Li?
- Tourism.

377
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,584
I am a tourist.

378
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,582
What a coincidence!

379
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:53,226
Edward!
- Having a good time?

380
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,600
Yeah!

381
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,027
I have no idea what I was thinking.

382
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,523
Do the next. Listen to this.

383
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:04,571
"3. Many people only see happiness,

384
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,901
only in their future."

385
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,863
I will drink to that!

386
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,740
Cheers!

387
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:17,630
Hey! I have an idea, I have an idea.
Who is available tomorrow night.


388
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:22,130
let's mark the bottle!
- You are cheating! - I'm not cheating!

389
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:27,673
I'm not cheating!
I'm ticking the bottle! - You are cheating!

390
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:31,268
Lighten up! Alright, alright, alright...

391
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,894
Will I see you again?

392
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:42,980
What hotel are you staying at?

393
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,065
Hyatt on the Bund.

394
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,987
What a coincidence.

395
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,788
We are driving to the Hyatt on the Bund.
Thank you.

396
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,835
Welcome back to Hyatt on the Bund.

397
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:19,308
Well, I'm not sure what the custom is for,

398
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:23,319
escorting a young lady to, a room.

399
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,147
I'll be right back.

400
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,009
I'm not sure what the custom is,

401
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:31,509
for undressing in front of...

402
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,932
Hector?

403
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:20,614
 This is Hector.
- Did you have a good time, last night?

404
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:23,871
Yeah, you know happy.
I gotto go.

405
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,588
I'd really like to take you to lunch.

406
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,457
Really?
- Yeah.

407
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:34,882
You pick.
Just text me when and where.

408
00:37:47,883 --> 00:37:52,179
4. HAPPINESS COULD BE THE FREEDOM TO LOVE MORE THAN ONE WOMAN AT THE SAME TIME.

409
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,213
Welcome!
Explore this substance.

410
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,093
Yes. Great!

411
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,175
I like it.

412
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,942
What are you doing?
- Nothing.

413
00:38:37,643 --> 00:38:38,939
Hi!
- Hi!

414
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:46,579
Listen! This is China, you're Chinese,
I'm clueless.

415
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,661
I need to go to the mountains.
Why don't you come with me?

416
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,956
Too soon?

417
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,333
Preamble, Hector, preamble!

418
00:38:55,625 --> 00:39:00,256
No. It's just,
you're different. You're kind.

419
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:02,598
I'm not used to it.

420
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,597
They look very happy.

421
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:14,315
They're with their friends.
- Why are they sitting in the middle of the street? - Thank you.

422
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,980
They have nowhere else to go.
It's their day off.

423
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,657
They have no money,
to sit in cafes.

424
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,985
They send all to their families.

425
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,987
So, they meet here on the street.

426
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,657
They come from the countryside like I do.

427
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,834
My sisters and mother are still there.

428
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:34,297
Look at them, they're like a happy little island
in a see of grim businessmen.

429
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:36,166
Makes you wonder.

430
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:40,970
Hey, listen. Your mother and your sisters,
we could pay them a visit,

431
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,339
on our trip.

432
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:47,348
Oh, Hector.

433
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:51,936
The difference between those cleaning ladies and me,

434
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:57,316
is that, there is no shame in how they make their money.

435
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,449
They can show their faces back home.

436
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,871
I can't.

437
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,537
Why is that, then?

438
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:15,455
Ying Li!

439
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:20,673
Hey, wait!

440
00:40:21,174 --> 00:40:22,970
Sorry! Sorry!

441
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:28,435
Your friend paid for last night,
who is paying for today?

442
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,892
You seemed so real.
You tricked me.

443
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,519
You tricked me!

444
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,273
What're you doing? What're you...

445
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:53,869
Ying Li!

446
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:20,166
5. SOMETIMES, HAPPINESS IS NOT KNOWING THE WHOLE STORY

447
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:11,593
It's monday. We are closed.

448
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:15,264
Yeah, but, I've come a very long way.
I'm a psychiatrist.

449
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,600
I'm trying to discover what makes people happy.

450
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,018
It's monday. We are closed.

451
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:25,236
Okay, okay!
Look, far be it from me, and forgive me for asking,
and I don't mean to pry,

452
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:28,615
but, would you consider yourself to be a happy person?

453
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:32,277
What part of Monday don't you understand?

454
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:38,165
Trainee, he has a lot to learn.
Would you like to come in?

455
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,702
Yes, please,
cause I might not be around next week.

456
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:45,123
The moment of death is indeed uncertain!
Now, come in!

457
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:54,261
Come come, quick!
- Okay.

458
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:06,774
When you've been a fugitive,
you've been in prison for your beliefs,

459
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,987
you've lost your family and loved ones...

460
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:12,526
I mean, you've just been through so much.
How is it you're so happy?

461
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,994
Because I've been through so much.

462
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,539
My search for happiness is one thing,

463
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:21,038
but making it the goal just doesn't work, does it?

464
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:23,332
Higher than that, Hector!

465
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:29,926
More important than what we are searching for,
is what we're avoiding.

466
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:35,299
Like unhappiness. So,
don't make unhappiness not the goal.

467
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,300
Higher than that!

468
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:42,855
Avoiding unhappiness is not the road to happiness.

469
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:46,359
You hold all the cards, Hector.

470
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,656
6. AVOIDING UNHAPPINESS
IS NOT THE ROAD TO HAPPINESS

471
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:10,591
It's very noble this book you're writing.

472
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,962
When you've reached the end of it, come back to me.

473
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:16,886
I would like to see,
what you have learned.

474
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:20,180
Right, you mean, when I'm just passing through this area again.

475
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:23,771
We have Skype. Skype me!

476
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:26,604
You have Skype?

477
00:45:31,205 --> 00:45:34,901
Hi!
- Hector? - Hi!

478
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,319
How is it going? How is work?

479
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:42,786
It's great! Can you believe it, they're going with "Apollonax"!

480
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:45,660
Market research says it is the biggest erection they've had... Sorry, sorry.

481
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:49,543
Reaction, they had after a survey in ten years.

482
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:55,135
Clara, look where I am. I'm in a monastery.
- Where you belong!

483
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:57,926
 How was Shanghai?

484
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:02,393
Yeah, I've made friends with a rich banker,
and he took me around town. And we...

485
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:05,351
Now you know any kind of happiness money can buy?

486
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:18,193
It's weird seeing you like this.
You look really small.

487
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:34,008
Hector, come come!
You have to see! The wind! Come!

488
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,276
Hector! Look!

489
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:02,449
Do you see?

490
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:05,657
All of them!

491
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:19,592
Looks like we've lost the sun, Tey.

492
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:24,133
Best keep moving, shall we?

493
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,324
Thank you.

494
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:44,578
Poor bastard. I'm sorry.

495
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,241
Where to next?
- Africa.

496
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:52,874
For happy?
- Or unhappy. I've to wait and see.

497
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,544
You're a very very strange person, Hector.

498
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:59,301
A kind of person normally I avoid like the plague.

499
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:04,382
Glad I did'nt, buddy.

500
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,642
Thank you, Edward. I mean it.

501
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:27,163
Sir, you do realize that this is four flights?
That is two days. - Absolutely.

502
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:31,375
And last flight is not so...
It is not exactly...

503
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:34,249
Absolutely.
- Let me put it this way:

504
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,047
First Class.

505
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:38,795
Business Class.

506
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,335
Economy.

507
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:43,587
You.

508
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,592
Bring it!

509
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:56,942
Oh my god!

510
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:03,024
If you look at this plane,
you'll notice it's quite old.

511
00:49:03,399 --> 00:49:07,154
That means it's never crushed before.
Should be quite reassuring.

512
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:10,577
Thank you, I think.

513
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,625
From this point forwards, I'll be nicer to my patients who are afraid to fly.

514
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:20,000
Are you a doctor?
- I'm a psychiatrist, yeah.

515
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,964
So, I assume you've read this?

516
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:25,839
Yeah, yeah
I'm familiar with Coreman from my UCLA days.

517
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,886
He was just making a name for himself.

518
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:31,727
Quite a name! I saw him on CNN.
What do they call him?

519
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:35,644
"The Einstein of happiness".
I've read it twice.

520
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:40,612
You can keep it. I like it, but I don't think I'll need it as much as the country it was written for.

521
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:41,979
Thanks.

522
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,440
Oh my god! This isn't safe!

523
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:52,786
Do you have children? Are you married?
- No.

524
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:54,329
Why not?

525
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:59,961
Why do I get the feeling, there is a woman out there in the world asking herself the very same question?

526
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,208
You know, there is really only one question:

527
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:05,211
7. Does this person bring you predominantly:

528
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:08,806
A) Up or B) Down?

529
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:21,944
"Side effects may include happiness.".

530
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:24,522
So, what about you?

531
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:26,991
What makes for your happiness?

532
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,531
Home, family,

533
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:32,455
the idea that my children can live a normal life,

534
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:35,324
without bodyguards taking them to school.

535
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:41,585
Have you ever had sweet-potato stew?
Realy sweeet-potate stew!

536
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:45,464
You have to!
Here's the tip:

537
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:48,963
If we land safely,
one night this week, my mother's house,

538
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:52,512
my whole family,
swett-potato stew.

539
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:57,605
There will be a tomorrow, my friend.

540
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,568
I'll be right back.

541
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:14,329
Why don't you let me do this?
- That's very kind.

542
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:20,662
Oh, God, hold it up! Hold it up!
Get the button!

543
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:21,912
Hector!

544
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:26,042
Michael, Jesus! Help!

545
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:28,427
Can anyone...
I have a Swiss Army knife.

546
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:32,549
Oh, dear!
- This is Marcel. He's our bodyguard.

547
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:33,650
Hi!
- Hector?

548
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,892
Welcome.

549
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,514
The car is scarce here,
so better take precautions.

550
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,231
Okay, let's go!

551
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,988
See? You haven't changed.

552
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:54,741
Neither have you.

553
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:58,165
I mean, look at you!
Hector goes to Africa.

554
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:03,629
You and Aggy, you seemed so solid.
What happened with that?

555
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:08,259
Hey, Agnes and I always knew you'd end up here when the dust settles.

556
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:10,299
Yep, all this.

557
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,925
This was my calling, wasn't it.

558
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:16,267
You know, the dust as you put it, never really settles.

559
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:19,513
There's been progress, though, right?
I mean, foreign aid. That was on my blink,

560
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:23,312
there is another fundraiser.
- There is a big difference between being here,

561
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:25,943
and being here to be photographed being here.

562
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,612
The money doesn't always make it
to where it's neded most.

563
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:31,365
It never leaves the city. It's useless.
- It's useless.

564
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:36,575
Still long ways to go, Hector.
But hey, that's why we are here, right?

565
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:00,018
Have a good night's rest, okay!
- Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

566
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,189
Don't give that many to them,
they'll bever leave you alone!

567
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:08,315
Hector, we'll pick you up at six,
and go straight to the clinic, okay?

568
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,104
See you tomorrow!

569
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:16,160
ALL VISITORS AND GUEST

570
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:18,570
ARE KINDLY REQUESTED TO LEAVE THEIR WEAPON WITH RECEPTION

571
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,756
Good evening.

572
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,347
What sort of beers you have?

573
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:43,311
Thank you.

574
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:48,734
I think you might need a bigger sign outside.
Some people might be missing it.

575
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:53,439
Hey guys! He wants to know how is the peace keeping going.

576
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:58,570
You're here to save the planet?
Plant some trees?

577
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:03,620
No, actually, I am here to help out to the Adulu clinic for a week or two.

578
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,418
What's in it for you?

579
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:07,957
Nothing.

580
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:13,634
Your English is very good.
Where are you from?

581
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:15,924
Wanna see my passport?

582
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:24,269
I prefer your hair the way it is now.

583
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:30,021
That's good. I liked that.

584
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,732
So, what brings you here?

585
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,530
Farming.
- Farming!

586
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:41,245
What kind? And would that be,
what makes you happy?

587
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,822
What are you, the fucking New York Times?

588
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,958
No, I'm just researching what makes people happy.

589
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,128
If you're wearing a wire,
you're dead.

590
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:57,636
And you know what?
No one will care.

591
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:01,340
Okay. No wire.
Sorry for the shirt.

592
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:08,640
My name is Hector. I'm a psychiatrist.
- Very well, Hector.

593
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:11,608
I bet what I farm makes more people happy,

594
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,272
than to crap you dish out.

595
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:17,401
I see. Farmer.

596
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,738
I get it. Drugs.

597
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:27,162
Forgive me, but if your happiness causes other people's unhappiness,

598
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:29,372
then how can that be happiness?

599
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:31,704
Doesn't that bother you?

600
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:35,966
I don't cause unhappiness,
I respond to it, same as you.

601
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,712
We both fill a need,
but they demand we don't create.

602
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:42,514
Self-righteous fuckers.

603
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:46,727
What's your solution?
Another embargo?

604
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:51,315
So the country gets more poor,
people starve, babies die,

605
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:54,351
and their leaders couldn't care less.

606
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:58,989
If you wanna be happy,
take care of your own.

607
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,619
So you're happy.

608
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,290
No.

609
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:15,248
Because my wife is unhappy.
Which makes my kids unhappy.

610
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:18,501
And if my family is not happy,

611
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:21,428
how can I be happy?

612
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:26,217
She sees a shrink.
He gave her something new,

613
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:28,936
but it just makes her worse.

614
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:32,435
Do you mind if I ask what she is taking?

615
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,896
I don't know.

616
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:38,149
Maybe, if you could show me the prescription,
I may help.

617
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:42,324
Why?
- I'd like to.

618
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:43,825
Bullshit.

619
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:46,779
You need it for yourself,
like everyone else.

620
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:51,409
Why would either of us wish to prolong
anyone else's misery?

621
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:54,753
Fuck you!

622
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,388
Holy Jesus. What's that?

623
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:20,024
 With patience and perseverance,
you can climb your mountain.

624
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:43,132
I don't like these dosages,
and these two clash.

625
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:45,296
Let me...

626
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:48,800
Sorry, me and pens...

627
00:57:50,342 --> 00:57:51,514
Thank you.

628
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:56,098
This women is great. She's based in Bogota.
She's an old colleague of mine.

629
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:59,275
Tell her that I referred your wife.
I think she's been over-medicated.

630
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:03,189
It could be the source of her problem.
Here is my phone number.

631
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:06,317
Give me a call,
let me know how she goes.

632
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:08,281
Thank you.

633
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:13,035
Hector, it's past six,
we gotto go!

634
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:17,706
What are you doing, even talking to him?

635
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:19,876
That's Diego Baresco.

636
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:23,509
That's a kind of guy that
drags his country to shit.

637
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:31,509
So wait, you know that guy?
- Everybody knows Diego Baresco.

638
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:36,855
Hector, really?

639
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,052
Hello, how is it going?

640
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,977
Hello doc, how is it going?
- This is Hector.

641
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,723
So, let's see.

642
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:23,982
How are you feeling?
Do you feel the baby move?

643
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:26,980
Hello, Baruti.

644
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:28,402
Do you feel okay?

645
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:32,570
This is my friend, Hector.
He's gonna help us too.

646
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:34,951
Just take a look.

647
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:38,617
I don't hurt anymore.
Can I go home?

648
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:40,460
You are not leaving until I say so.

649
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:43,998
But my sister,
she needs me.

650
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:47,126
Baruti lost his mother,
last month.

651
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:49,503
Listen, if you're not well,

652
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:52,180
you are no help to your sister.

653
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:54,348
Good boy.

654
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:56,385
Stay with him.
Just talk to him.

655
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:58,846
What I can do.

656
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:04,401
So, Baruti.

657
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:07,737
How old is your sister?

658
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:16,406
What? - Your face, it's funny.
It's like this...

659
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:23,545
Yeah, yeah.
That's my listening face.

660
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:25,839
How about this?

661
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:31,427
You're funny.
- Am I? Thank you very much.

662
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:35,340
You're a big boy.

663
01:00:40,341 --> 01:00:42,937
9. HAPPINESS IS, ANSWERING YOUR CALLING

664
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:46,438
He's gonna be okay.

665
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:50,063
Absolutely...
Michael is a very...

666
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:53,116
It's gonna be fine.

667
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:03,952
Mama! Mama!

668
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:11,885
Is that a...

669
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:16,890
There is a lion over here.
These two lions, just, quite close.

670
01:01:18,717 --> 01:01:21,311
Excuse me. Excuse me!

671
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:26,942
Take off your Ipod, there is a lion really close by.
Is this normal? To have a lion...

672
01:01:32,943 --> 01:01:34,239
See you buddy.

673
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:44,751
You know, you could always stay a while.
We sure could use another medical doctor.

674
01:01:45,285 --> 01:01:47,379
It's tempting.
I've been watching you all week.

675
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:50,757
You're a necessity.
Me, I'm just, I'm a luxury.

676
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:52,463
I sometimes feel like,

677
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:54,970
psychiatry comes with affluence, you know.

678
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:59,717
The richer the city, the more psychiatrists there are per square mile. What does that tell you?

679
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:02,931
It tells me you've been too hard on yourself.

680
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:07,687
Come on, Hector,
it's not some kind of a competition.

681
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,313
The mind can hurt as much as the body, yeah?

682
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:19,157
And maybe, if I seem happy,

683
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:23,870
it's because I'm loved for who I am.

684
01:02:35,571 --> 01:02:36,467
Okay.

685
01:02:47,368 --> 01:02:50,664
9. HAPPINESS IS BEING LOVED FOR WHO YOU ARE

686
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:10,624
 Hello!
- Hello!

687
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:12,247
I'm in Africa.

688
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:18,758
I'm with Michael. And he hasn't changed.
He looks exactly like he did in the photo I showed you.

689
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:22,265
You never showed me a photo of Michael.
- Didn't I?

690
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:24,142
You just think you did.

691
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:29,064
I thought I had. Hey listen, Clara.

692
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:33,523
About that last conversation we had...
- Hi, boys!

693
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:38,528
Hey, guys! Back off! Jesus!

694
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:43,662
This is private conversation. Seriously? Clara...

695
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:45,830
 Hector, you know, I got it. It's fine.

696
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:48,074
 Let's not make it harder than it already is.

697
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:49,952
 Where're you going?
- Out.

698
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:52,166
What, like that?
- No.

699
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:54,673
No! In this. It's a work event.

700
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:58,126
I've never seen that dress.
That dress is new.

701
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,879
 I know. Oh, I gotta go. 

702
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:02,801
 Bye Hector.
- What do you mean, bye?

703
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:05,683
Out.

704
01:04:08,184 --> 01:04:08,880
Okay.

705
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,147
Out.

706
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:15,228
Hector! - Hey!
- You found it okay?

707
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:19,147
You're literally get lost...
So, you're ready for sweet-potato stew?

708
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:22,283
I have never been readier in my life!
- Welcome, welcome!

709
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:24,823
Clear the way, you amateurs.

710
01:04:25,153 --> 01:04:28,453
Chef coming through. Chef with the severe case of...

711
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:32,578
Tit for tat. The only difference is,
I don't need a sexy white dress.

712
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:36,047
Alright, alright, alright.

713
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,590
There you go. - More wein.
- More wein, more wein.

714
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:43,009
More wein! More wein!

715
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:52,390
Have I ever said that how much I love this music.
I can almost dance. Almost!

716
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:56,393
I see you, extremely pretty cousin.
Beware! Okay?

717
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:58,190
I have permisson.

718
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:04,696
Cheers!

719
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:11,454
I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you too. You're so beautiful.

720
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:15,455
Thank you, thank you so very very much!
- Thank you my friend.

721
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:17,581
Who's available tomorrow night?

722
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:21,717
Bless you, my son!

723
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:24,216
Bye!

724
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:32,645
10. SWEET-POTATO STEW

725
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,686
Süßkartoffel-Eintopf!

726
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:09,383
Give me the keys!

727
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:11,760
And the hat, man!

728
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:00,103
Keep it handy travel candy?

729
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:09,151
You didn't pick me up!

730
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:11,820
Why are you different?
Why are you both different?

731
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:15,373
This is very strange!

732
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:17,208
What are you doing?

733
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:18,709
What is this place?

734
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:33,926
You've got to understand, I'm a psychiatrist!

735
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,143
I'm neutral, like Switzerland!

736
01:07:40,144 --> 01:07:42,440
11. FEAR IS IMPEDIMENT TO HAPPINESS

737
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:55,537
Look.

738
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:58,912
Look, can we just see this as one of those,

739
01:07:59,284 --> 01:08:02,333
sort of random events that's just deeply inconvenient for both of us?

740
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:05,039
Get this piece of shit out of mu sight.

741
01:08:12,714 --> 01:08:14,842
No! Come back! No!

742
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:16,763
Please don't go!

743
01:08:50,163 --> 01:08:52,763
 Losing a soldier.
There I will never be.

744
01:09:06,764 --> 01:09:09,060
 Soldier go, soldier come.
Barrack remain.

745
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:19,789
Tell me,
how much do you think we can get for him?

746
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:22,326
Forget it,
he's already seen us, dickhead.

747
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,920
So, so, what do we do, boss?

748
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:29,132
Let him rot!

749
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,994
"Keep it handy travel candy"

750
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,204
Nice.

751
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:03,203
Once upon a time,

752
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:06,328
there was a psychiatrist called Hector.

753
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:10,544
Who was scared to death of dying,

754
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:13,509
before he never really lived.

755
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:20,930
I'm sorry, I have never realy been...

756
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:23,769
The thing is...

757
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:28,058
Would you mind giving me some privacy?

758
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,417
If you're going to do it, Hector,

759
01:10:56,127 --> 01:11:01,099
do it totally. - She's yet discover the words "maternity" or "leave "

760
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:05,975
Sie sind nur
auf Ihren Vorteil aus, wie alle.

761
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:11,229
Du hast mich reingelegt.

762
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:40,425
 You hold all the cards, Hector.

763
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:57,025
Clara, Clara.

764
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:03,820
Where are you taking me?

765
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:05,746
Please, please! I haven't done anything!

766
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:14,588
This shit's funny, man.

767
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:18,585
"Happiness is being loved for who you are."

768
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:24,261
ClaraYingLi, ClaraYingLi...

769
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:28,519
What's this one?
It's been crossed out.

770
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:33,353
It says "The evil you do in this life could cost you your happiness in the next."

771
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:37,354
No, it doesn't, I'm sorry, I made that up.
It says:

772
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:40,531
"Happiness could be the freedom to love two women at the same time."

773
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:49,240
Look, look, look. I know that Police aren't gonna track me down.

774
01:12:49,657 --> 01:12:53,207
the thing is, I'm really trying to help a friend of mine whose wife is very ill.

775
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:55,667
He's really counting on me.
If I just suddenly disappear,

776
01:12:56,038 --> 01:13:00,760
then he's gonna come looking for me
and you do not want this man as an enemy.

777
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:04,131
Even if your friend is the president himself,
it wouldn't make a difference.

778
01:13:05,423 --> 01:13:08,267
Well, it's not the president,
it's Diego Baresco.

779
01:13:14,432 --> 01:13:16,025
Prove it.

780
01:13:18,185 --> 01:13:19,402
I can't.

781
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:25,034
Wait, no, no! I promise you,

782
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:29,080
I know him. I know him. He's a friend of mine.
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

783
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:30,573
I promise you.

784
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:31,999
Shut up!

785
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:33,868
Please!
- Why are you here?

786
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:36,462
I'm researching the state of happiness.
- Bullshit!

787
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,251
No! God!

788
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:48,974
I'm trying to find the ways
to make my patients happy.

789
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:52,975
Bullshit!
- God! Stop it! Please stop it!

790
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:57,938
God!

791
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:02,818
I wanna know if I can be happy.

792
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:29,094
This probably isn't the right moment, but I

793
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:34,019
I just wonder what your personal idea of happiness is.

794
01:14:34,345 --> 01:14:36,347
You know, personally.

795
01:14:38,057 --> 01:14:40,560
If you want it, you take it!

796
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:43,028
That's very insightful. I just want to...

797
01:14:43,354 --> 01:14:47,404
Would you mind if I just wrote that down?
Just for posterity?

798
01:14:51,237 --> 01:14:52,989
Give him the notebook.

799
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:09,301
Oh, God!
I just never have a pen!

800
01:15:33,154 --> 01:15:37,705
One last thing, one final request,
I promise,

801
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:40,791
Would one of you gentlemen mind,

802
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:45,167
making sure this gold pen finds its way back to my dear friend,

803
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,714
Diego Baresco?

804
01:17:04,515 --> 01:17:08,711
 With patience and perseverance,
you can climb your mountain.

805
01:17:17,215 --> 01:17:21,111
12. HAPPINESS IS FEELING COMPLETELY ALIVE

806
01:17:22,429 --> 01:17:23,851
I'm alive!

807
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:26,274
I'm alive!

808
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:47,917
Hello, Hector.

809
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:50,586
I'm alive, too.

810
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:55,964
What are you doing?
You are very beautiful.

811
01:17:57,381 --> 01:17:59,383
Very beautiful, but

812
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,098
let's just...
Dance!

813
01:18:15,816 --> 01:18:17,693
WELCOME BACK, HECTOR

814
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:41,724
13. HAPPINESS, IS KNOWING HOW TO CELEBRATE

815
01:18:54,271 --> 01:18:56,148
Hector?
- Clara! Hi!

816
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:59,034
Clara, I got kidnapped! Really!

817
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:03,781
 Is that a cut? Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine, now. I nearly died.

818
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:06,329
I thought about you so much.

819
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:09,708
And?
- So very much.

820
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:14,792
Hector, why are you telling me this?
I just... What am I supposed to think?

821
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:17,295
I don't hear from you for...

822
01:19:18,963 --> 01:19:20,260
Are you coming home?

823
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:23,426
Not yet.
- Look, I've gotta go.

824
01:19:25,219 --> 01:19:26,846
Oh, no!
- What is it? What?

825
01:19:27,221 --> 01:19:29,690
I dropped the cup on the floor.
You see, that's what you do!

826
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:32,105
I didn't do any...
- Tell me what you want.

827
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:36,234
I'm not part of your project.
You just have to decide, Hector.

828
01:19:36,647 --> 01:19:38,649
Yes or no? Yes or no?

829
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:40,693
I've got to go.

830
01:19:41,068 --> 01:19:43,787
Do you know where you're going next?
- No!

831
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:52,041
You know where you're going next?
- Yes, Los Angeles.

832
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:55,128
Agnes.

833
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:58,465
It's a work related matter.

834
01:19:59,253 --> 01:20:01,051
Unfinished business.

835
01:20:06,677 --> 01:20:07,929
So

836
01:20:08,887 --> 01:20:10,059
finish it.

837
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,688
Champagne, Sir?
Would you like the vintage?

838
01:20:17,021 --> 01:20:17,988
Why not?

839
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:21,195
Madam, the vintage?

840
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:22,947
Why not?

841
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,415
Why else do we travel first class?

842
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:35,209
TO DO - DONE

843
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:38,004
FLY FIRST CLASS: DONE

844
01:20:44,757 --> 01:20:46,350
 Sorry to interrupt,
ladies and gentlemen, 

845
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:50,013
 But if there is a doctor on board of this plane,
would you please contact the cabin crew.

846
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:51,723
 Thank you very much.

847
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:54,942
 Once again, if there is a doctor on board...

848
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:11,579
Please.

849
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:14,666
Don't let them turn the plane around.

850
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:18,007
I have to see my sister one last time.

851
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:22,337
On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the most pain you can imagine,

852
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:23,928
wo würden Sie sich einordnen?

853
01:21:26,757 --> 01:21:27,804
Bei 9.

854
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:32,228
I need to see the pilot.

855
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:38,774
She had a massive tumor removed from her brain about 3 months ago, and the swelling is acute.

856
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:41,401
Should we turn around?
- No, no, no.

857
01:21:41,814 --> 01:21:44,784
But if you can lower the altitude of the plane,

858
01:21:45,109 --> 01:21:47,858
it'd make a big difference on the pressure on her brain. Would be tremendous help to her..

859
01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:49,454
I'll check with air traffic control.

860
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:57,247
And I've lived in 6 countries,
can you believe that?

861
01:21:57,621 --> 01:22:00,841
 Ladies and gentlemen,
please don't be concerned.

862
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:04,087
 We will be flying at a lower altitude
for the remainder of our journey. Thank you.

863
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:07,390
Okay. It's gonna make a huge difference, alright?

864
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:11,056
Let's try to get that 9 down to a 5.

865
01:22:13,303 --> 01:22:14,304
Madam,

866
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:18,100
Do you mind?
- If you must.

867
01:22:26,859 --> 01:22:27,781
Okay, may I?

868
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:49,340
Do you have any children, doctor?

869
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:52,051
No.

870
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:56,685
My husband and I, it was our only regret.
We couldn't.

871
01:22:57,890 --> 01:22:59,517
But you know what?

872
01:22:59,892 --> 01:23:02,190
It was pretty good fun trying.

873
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:08,029
Are you okay?

874
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:10,820
There you go. It will pass.

875
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:17,744
Okay now.
After my last surgery,

876
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:21,588
I was in and out of consciousness for days.

877
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:24,216
They said, I wouldn't make it.

878
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:28,838
And, I remember the moment...

879
01:23:29,713 --> 01:23:31,306
I remember it totally.

880
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:34,301
I was in a sand storm,

881
01:23:34,718 --> 01:23:36,641
walking with all these people,

882
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:40,186
with our heads covered
and walking in the same direction.

883
01:23:41,058 --> 01:23:45,154
And I kept thinking to myself:
Why? Why am I in this group?

884
01:23:47,898 --> 01:23:52,199
I wasn't scared. I was,
I don't know, puzzled?

885
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:58,709
And then, I heard my name being called:
"Djamila! Over here!"

886
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:01,708
And I looked to my right,

887
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:05,958
and in the middle of an open space is was this,

888
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:09,087
this beautiful...

889
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:11,546
How do you call it?

890
01:24:12,798 --> 01:24:14,300
Happy go round?

891
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:17,390
Merry-go-round.
It's a carousel.

892
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:22,941
And all the people,
that I know and love,

893
01:24:25,102 --> 01:24:27,355
were riding on this carousel.

894
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:34,036
They were laughing, waving.

895
01:24:36,697 --> 01:24:38,745
Waving for me to join them.

896
01:24:47,124 --> 01:24:50,924
It took everything I had,
to run to them.

897
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:56,182
But I did it.

898
01:25:04,808 --> 01:25:07,982
It was my last ride, wasn't it?

899
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:13,900
Yes.

900
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:16,408
That was your last ride.

901
01:25:33,712 --> 01:25:35,635
All those faces.

902
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:38,388
All those hearts.

903
01:25:44,348 --> 01:25:46,942
I'm such a lucky woman.

904
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:06,997
 Ladies and gentleman, thank you once again for your cooperation.

905
01:26:07,371 --> 01:26:09,749
 It made a big difference, believe me.

906
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:21,059
Don't take her to the hospital,
take her straight to this address.

907
01:26:21,385 --> 01:26:22,557
Are you gonna be okay?

908
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:30,686
I am not afraid, Hector.

909
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:34,656
People who are afraid of death,
are afraid of life.

910
01:26:37,442 --> 01:26:39,410
You have a real talent, you know.

911
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:42,789
Not really my field.
- No,

912
01:26:43,073 --> 01:26:45,075
you misunderstand.

913
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:47,452
Listening is loving.

914
01:27:11,453 --> 01:27:15,749
14. LISTENING IS LOVING

915
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:05,614
Of all the places you could have chosen,

916
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:17,255
This beach, you know, this whole area,
it's just, it changed so much.

917
01:28:18,251 --> 01:28:20,629
Nostalgia is not what it used to be, Hector.

918
01:28:24,257 --> 01:28:25,304
You've been busy.

919
01:28:27,093 --> 01:28:28,265
Lily!

920
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:33,104
Hey, baby.

921
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:35,226
Jack!

922
01:28:38,688 --> 01:28:40,190
Okay, you've been really busy.

923
01:28:40,941 --> 01:28:42,067
Kids,

924
01:28:42,651 --> 01:28:44,244
this is mommy's...

925
01:28:47,113 --> 01:28:48,786
Mommy's Hector.

926
01:28:58,959 --> 01:29:00,677
"Action Man".

927
01:29:01,795 --> 01:29:02,887
Hello.
- Hello.

928
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:06,387
Oh, God.

929
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:14,691
I've got you seeing Professor Coreman tomorrow, you owe me.

930
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:16,981
That guy is on a fast track to the Nobel.

931
01:29:17,269 --> 01:29:21,399
This happiness book is going through the roof.
- I know, I've read it. Somebody gave it to me. I liked it.

932
01:29:21,815 --> 01:29:22,941
Yeah, me too.

933
01:29:23,316 --> 01:29:27,321
I hate him. - We hate him.
Hate him. - Hate him.

934
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:31,829
Hey, I saw Michael.
- In Africa? Is he happy?

935
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,076
He's gay.

936
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:35,795
Are you?
- Gay?

937
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:38,711
No, happy.
I mean, is there someone?

938
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:41,259
Yes. Clara.

939
01:29:42,294 --> 01:29:44,513
I may have fucked up.

940
01:29:47,674 --> 01:29:49,517
They can't hear.

941
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:06,072
The Indiana Jones of happiness.

942
01:30:07,444 --> 01:30:09,788
Alan! Very nice to meet you.

943
01:30:10,155 --> 01:30:14,535
Me too. - Hector wants to know the secret to a happy marriage.

944
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,628
From the mathematician?

945
01:30:37,807 --> 01:30:39,559
Hi.
- Hey, I'm in L.A.!

946
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:43,030
I knew it! You're with sock drawer!
- Sock draw?

947
01:30:43,313 --> 01:30:45,407
That skank in the sock drawer, in the photo.

948
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:48,239
The one you have kept hidden from me.

949
01:30:48,652 --> 01:30:50,871
That's what this whole trip's been all about, am I right?

950
01:30:52,072 --> 01:30:55,872
Jesus, Clara, she's not a skank, okay?
She's a psychologist!

951
01:30:56,242 --> 01:30:58,665
Not to mention the pregnant mother of two beautiful children.

952
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:00,581
Au!

953
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,042
That really hurt, Hector, you knew it did.

954
01:31:04,417 --> 01:31:08,888
She's my oldest friend, alright?
What were you doing in my sock drawer anyway?

955
01:31:09,255 --> 01:31:11,098
Packing away your socks!

956
01:31:12,092 --> 01:31:15,517
Before taking care of every other aspect of your life.

957
01:31:15,887 --> 01:31:18,140
 Maybe if you didn't assume I needn't so much taken care of

958
01:31:18,556 --> 01:31:20,229
I've been taking care of myself.

959
01:31:20,642 --> 01:31:23,521
You know what "smothering" is, Clara?
It's "s"mothering, with an "s"!

960
01:31:23,895 --> 01:31:28,275
That's the lamest fucking thing I have ever heard. And you get paid for this?

961
01:31:28,692 --> 01:31:30,694
Yeah, but at least I don't make a living

962
01:31:31,027 --> 01:31:34,907
making up meaningless, manipulative names for seriously dodgy drugs.

963
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:38,418
Is this call as bad as I think it is?

964
01:31:39,661 --> 01:31:41,959
Yes. Yes, I think it is.

965
01:31:43,415 --> 01:31:46,339
Fine! At last a decision.

966
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:48,929
I can get on with my meaningless life.

967
01:31:49,295 --> 01:31:50,421
Oh, shi...

968
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:52,136
God!

969
01:32:06,855 --> 01:32:08,653
Darling. Sweetheart.

970
01:32:09,232 --> 01:32:10,905
Where is my fucking pen?

971
01:32:12,610 --> 01:32:13,907
Diego

972
01:32:14,279 --> 01:32:18,580
It's here. Actually, I've got it.
It saved my life.

973
01:32:18,950 --> 01:32:21,544
How are you, anyway? How is she?
- Very good.

974
01:32:21,995 --> 01:32:26,000
I feel like I got my wife back.
And a lot more.

975
01:32:28,710 --> 01:32:32,260
What's the name of your friends clinic?
The one who hates me.

976
01:32:33,048 --> 01:32:37,269
Adulu-Clinic, why?
- I wanna make a donation. Anonymous, of course.

977
01:32:37,635 --> 01:32:38,932
What's in it for you?

978
01:32:40,263 --> 01:32:41,310
Nothing.

979
01:32:42,682 --> 01:32:43,729
Good man!

980
01:32:44,184 --> 01:32:46,232
Go fuck yourself!

981
01:33:06,873 --> 01:33:09,092
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

982
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:13,338
How did the call go with Clara?

983
01:33:14,214 --> 01:33:16,933
Horrendous. Terminal.

984
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:19,849
I'm sorry. Wanna talk about it?

985
01:33:20,386 --> 01:33:23,936
Have we met?
- Alright, you are Hector. Of course you don't. What was I thinking?

986
01:33:25,391 --> 01:33:29,441
Right, Agnes.
- I knew you were gonna ask me about this,

987
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:31,652
and I thought about it last night.

988
01:33:33,024 --> 01:33:37,700
I have never felt so happy, really.

989
01:33:38,029 --> 01:33:41,283
Or exhausted, I mean. The chaos, sometimes it's just out of control.

990
01:33:41,699 --> 01:33:45,329
But, you know, I have a job I love,
and a husband I love,

991
01:33:45,703 --> 01:33:48,877
and two beautiful kids I love,
a home I love.

992
01:33:49,249 --> 01:33:52,128
The only real shadow of my happiness

993
01:33:52,502 --> 01:33:54,925
is that when I tell myself it's too good to last.

994
01:33:55,296 --> 01:33:58,891
And Hector, the marriage,
whatever the marriage is,

995
01:33:59,259 --> 01:34:01,853
the marriage itself is never in question.

996
01:34:02,428 --> 01:34:04,556
And that makes me happy.

997
01:34:14,649 --> 01:34:16,151
What?

998
01:34:17,861 --> 01:34:20,589
I don't know, it's just...
You know,

999
01:34:22,890 --> 01:34:24,290
Thinking about what might have been.

1000
01:34:30,957 --> 01:34:31,879
What?

1001
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:39,515
Agnes.

1002
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:43,600
What? - Nevermind. Forget it.
It's not even worth discussing.

1003
01:34:44,179 --> 01:34:45,681
Come on, what?

1004
01:34:46,055 --> 01:34:48,023
"What might have been?"

1005
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:50,943
God, how about what is, right now?

1006
01:34:51,978 --> 01:34:55,073
It just suits you, doesn't it?
Holding out to a fantasy...

1007
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:58,740
You know, when you put someone on a pedestal, or on hold, or to the side,

1008
01:34:59,068 --> 01:35:01,116
or whatever you wanna call it,
do you think that's a compliment?

1009
01:35:01,738 --> 01:35:04,617
Because it's not, it's the opposite.
And you know why?

1010
01:35:04,949 --> 01:35:09,580
Because I am not that fantasy.
I'm better than that fantasy. I am real!

1011
01:35:09,913 --> 01:35:11,165
I got married.

1012
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:14,960
I had a baby, and than another one,
and I'm having another one.

1013
01:35:15,335 --> 01:35:18,555
And do you think I want it to be Hector there, cutting the umbilical cord? No!

1014
01:35:18,838 --> 01:35:21,341
Because Hector would throw up,

1015
01:35:21,841 --> 01:35:24,264
and then faint.
Because you're squeamish.

1016
01:35:24,677 --> 01:35:27,021
You're emotionally squeamish.

1017
01:35:27,347 --> 01:35:30,897
You really are some kind of...
weird psychiatrist, you know that right?

1018
01:35:32,977 --> 01:35:36,652
Trying so hard here to avoid the words "move" and "on"

1019
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:42,363
For crying out loud!
I'm just, flag that women, I don't know, 12 years!

1020
01:35:42,779 --> 01:35:44,907
Yeah, get back to that woman when the time is right. So,

1021
01:35:45,281 --> 01:35:48,034
Nothing, nothing, nothing,
then, "Hi! I'm in Africa!"

1022
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:52,084
"See you monday!" I mean, I'm just some kind of box you had to check, aren't I?

1023
01:36:06,803 --> 01:36:08,305
I did love you, Hector.

1024
01:36:13,893 --> 01:36:16,271
But I love Alan now.

1025
01:36:18,273 --> 01:36:19,695
Guess what!

1026
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:23,449
Whatever it is you think you're in love with,

1027
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:26,660
is not me.

1028
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:36,082
Come on, we're late.

1029
01:36:38,083 --> 01:36:40,179
15. NOSTALGIA IS NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE

1030
01:36:40,253 --> 01:36:41,721
... earning just the sort of wages

1031
01:36:42,422 --> 01:36:46,347
that would make your poor old mom proud.

1032
01:36:48,219 --> 01:36:49,721
And researchers

1033
01:36:50,096 --> 01:36:52,349
just love to tell us,

1034
01:36:53,182 --> 01:36:55,355
that money doesn't buy happiness.

1035
01:36:56,144 --> 01:36:59,444
I know what you're thinking,
how much do researchers make?

1036
01:37:00,565 --> 01:37:02,533
Everything in this world is going up.

1037
01:37:05,028 --> 01:37:10,330
And happiness is going down,
oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

1038
01:37:10,992 --> 01:37:16,624
How many of us, I wonder, can recall
that childhood moment

1039
01:37:17,332 --> 01:37:21,428
when we exprienced happiness as a state of being.

1040
01:37:21,794 --> 01:37:25,048
That single moment of untarnished joy.

1041
01:37:25,381 --> 01:37:29,852
That moment when
everything in our world,

1042
01:37:30,219 --> 01:37:32,142
inside and out

1043
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:36,108
was alright.

1044
01:37:36,893 --> 01:37:39,112
Everything was alright.

1045
01:37:44,150 --> 01:37:48,405
But now we've become a colony of adults
and everything is all wrong.

1046
01:37:48,780 --> 01:37:50,657
All the time!

1047
01:37:51,991 --> 01:37:55,996
It's as if we were on a quest
to get it back.

1048
01:37:56,371 --> 01:37:59,625
And yet the more we focus on our own personal happiness,

1049
01:37:59,999 --> 01:38:06,177
the more it is useless. In fact,
it's only when we are otherwise engaged, you know,

1050
01:38:06,547 --> 01:38:10,268
focused on, absorbed , inspired, communicating, discovering, learning

1051
01:38:10,635 --> 01:38:12,433
dancing, for heavens sake

1052
01:38:12,845 --> 01:38:17,897
that we experience happiness as a by product, a side effect.

1053
01:38:18,226 --> 01:38:24,199
Oh no. We should concern ourselves not so much with the pursuit of happiness,

1054
01:38:24,816 --> 01:38:27,786
but with the happiness of a pursuit.

1055
01:38:28,945 --> 01:38:32,199
But how do we measure happiness?

1056
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:36,123
Emotions are like colours, you know.

1057
01:38:36,536 --> 01:38:40,541
Difficult to explain once, but not now.
Not anymore.

1058
01:38:40,873 --> 01:38:46,505
All those who read auras, step aside!
This is science..

1059
01:38:47,171 --> 01:38:50,345
A new frontier, in its infancy,
but not for long.

1060
01:38:50,758 --> 01:38:55,229
Functional electrical impedance tomography by evoked response.

1061
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:57,352
Or as I call it: Peeping Tom.

1062
01:38:58,433 --> 01:39:03,234
My portal into the mysterious details of human emotions.

1063
01:39:03,646 --> 01:39:06,866
Emotions, that for the very first time,

1064
01:39:07,191 --> 01:39:10,695
we can separate, specify and quantify in actual units.

1065
01:39:11,654 --> 01:39:13,076
This male subject is Japanese.

1066
01:39:13,448 --> 01:39:18,079
Look at the abundance of bright orange around the happiness area.

1067
01:39:18,453 --> 01:39:20,000
Verging on ecstasy.

1068
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:22,332
It's as if the brain was smiling.

1069
01:39:23,166 --> 01:39:24,292
Cause?

1070
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:26,135
Half a liter of warm Sake.

1071
01:39:27,879 --> 01:39:29,131
And here we are again,

1072
01:39:29,505 --> 01:39:31,758
same Japanese gentleman,
eleven hours later.

1073
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:36,434
The color of grim despondency,
verging on suicide.

1074
01:39:36,846 --> 01:39:39,224
Otherwise known as an excruciating hangover.

1075
01:39:39,682 --> 01:39:41,434
Ask yourselves:

1076
01:39:41,851 --> 01:39:44,354
Is this worth that?

1077
01:39:49,817 --> 01:39:52,286
Thank you. You first, Agnes!

1078
01:39:52,987 --> 01:39:55,581
Oh, no, no, no.
- Oh, yes! We've made a deal.

1079
01:39:55,907 --> 01:39:57,705
Off you go into the isolation booth!

1080
01:39:58,034 --> 01:40:01,413
Helmet on! I want you to imagine yourself in three situations.

1081
01:40:01,787 --> 01:40:05,337
One that makes you very happy,
one very sad and one very scared.

1082
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,593
Recent memories can be useful.

1083
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:11,931
Do not tell me the order,
I will guess it myself.

1084
01:40:14,217 --> 01:40:17,187
They said I'm mind-reader,
that's a bloody lie, I'm not.

1085
01:40:17,553 --> 01:40:21,228
I'm just a good diagnostician
with an awesome toy!

1086
01:40:25,353 --> 01:40:26,570
 Ready when you are.

1087
01:40:42,537 --> 01:40:43,834
Out you come!

1088
01:40:48,209 --> 01:40:49,961
As I thought, you're an open book.

1089
01:40:50,336 --> 01:40:52,680
Sad, scared, happy.
In that order, final answer.

1090
01:40:54,006 --> 01:40:56,179
Yeah, you're good.

1091
01:40:56,551 --> 01:40:58,428
Your turn, Hector.

1092
01:40:59,387 --> 01:41:02,015
You know what, I think...
- Your turn, Hector! - Okay!

1093
01:41:04,559 --> 01:41:07,688
Head over yourself!
You're not an enemy of mine.

1094
01:41:09,355 --> 01:41:10,607
Sit my dear.

1095
01:41:12,775 --> 01:41:15,324
My way of identifying the emotions,

1096
01:41:15,736 --> 01:41:19,991
I assign a color to each corresponding part of the brain. I'ts pretty obvious, really.

1097
01:41:20,366 --> 01:41:23,040
Sunny yellow happy.
Ice blue sad.

1098
01:41:23,536 --> 01:41:26,255
Battery acid green fear.

1099
01:41:26,622 --> 01:41:28,590
It corrodes you, you know.

1100
01:41:36,132 --> 01:41:38,555
Right. Sad, scared, happy.

1101
01:41:38,926 --> 01:41:40,928
 Don't tell me the order and be specific!

1102
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:42,893
It's all about specificity.

1103
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:51,022
 I'm not gonna tell anybody. I promise you.

1104
01:41:52,607 --> 01:41:53,358
 Shut up!

1105
01:42:01,407 --> 01:42:02,624
That's odd.

1106
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:06,079
It's as if he's filtering, moderating his feelings.

1107
01:42:06,954 --> 01:42:10,458
Something's holding him back, some kind of barrier.

1108
01:42:21,552 --> 01:42:26,183
No, no, no! These are not the emotions of a grown man. - Tell me about it.

1109
01:42:26,599 --> 01:42:27,976
He's gonna have to dig a lot deeper.

1110
01:42:28,976 --> 01:42:30,603
There is no deeper.

1111
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:33,106
 I must admit, I'm a little baffled.

1112
01:42:34,607 --> 01:42:35,699
Hi, this is Hector.

1113
01:42:36,025 --> 01:42:40,747
 I think I can go deeper.
- Oh, fuck. We left the mic on.

1114
01:42:41,906 --> 01:42:44,250
I think I know where to go.

1115
01:42:44,784 --> 01:42:47,628
Courage, Hector.
We are right there with you.

1116
01:43:57,648 --> 01:43:59,901
This is Hector, who the hell is this?

1117
01:44:05,239 --> 01:44:07,367
 I wanted to be a mother,

1118
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:09,289
 I haven't...

1119
01:44:11,412 --> 01:44:13,164
 Just, not yours.

1120
01:44:15,791 --> 01:44:18,965
Clara, listen, don't go anywhere.

1121
01:44:19,336 --> 01:44:21,885
Just stay there, okay. Hang on.

1122
01:44:22,256 --> 01:44:25,135
Professor, can we stop?
I need to take this call.

1123
01:44:25,509 --> 01:44:26,556
Please.

1124
01:44:26,927 --> 01:44:27,769
 Please.

1125
01:44:28,804 --> 01:44:30,181
Clara, are you still there?

1126
01:44:31,932 --> 01:44:33,730
Yes, I'm here.

1127
01:44:34,059 --> 01:44:35,436
 Thank god.

1128
01:44:36,854 --> 01:44:37,901
 Clara, listen.

1129
01:44:45,613 --> 01:44:49,334
I'm sorry I didn't give you any explanation for this...

1130
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:55,673
insane journey, but the truth is, I didn't have any reasons of my own.

1131
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:58,919
I didn't explain it to myself.

1132
01:45:01,003 --> 01:45:04,598
I've learned a lot, you know, I've learned a lot about happiness.

1133
01:45:05,299 --> 01:45:07,267
 and I've learned about unhappiness.

1134
01:45:08,552 --> 01:45:11,431
And the thing that makes me most unhappy is the thought that

1135
01:45:11,764 --> 01:45:13,391
i might lose you.

1136
01:45:20,105 --> 01:45:21,982
And the thing that makes me happiest is the thought that

1137
01:45:22,274 --> 01:45:25,323
I could become the man that you spend the rest of your life with.

1138
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:41,377
I miss my Hector.

1139
01:45:44,964 --> 01:45:46,716
I miss my Clara.

1140
01:45:56,141 --> 01:45:58,360
 Hector. Keep going!
You are knocking out of the park!

1141
01:45:58,894 --> 01:45:59,941
Who is that?

1142
01:46:00,145 --> 01:46:03,866
It's sockdrawer, but don't worry.
I'm locked inside a metal booth.

1143
01:46:04,191 --> 01:46:05,864
Good, skanky bitch!

1144
01:46:12,908 --> 01:46:17,584
Listen, I was way out of the line, you know,
saying that your job was meaningless.

1145
01:46:17,913 --> 01:46:21,258
Believe me, nobody does meaningless like I do.

1146
01:46:21,625 --> 01:46:25,630
That really was "The kettle calling the pot black" there, you know.

1147
01:46:26,297 --> 01:46:27,344
Wait.

1148
01:46:27,715 --> 01:46:30,184
 Is it the pot or the kettle that calls the other one black?

1149
01:46:30,551 --> 01:46:33,020
And why black? What's that all about?

1150
01:46:33,637 --> 01:46:35,105
Yeah, I know.

1151
01:46:36,307 --> 01:46:38,150
Does it even matter?

1152
01:46:39,143 --> 01:46:42,738
We matter, Clara.
You and me, we matter.

1153
01:46:49,028 --> 01:46:50,450
Yeah.

1154
01:46:55,868 --> 01:46:58,542
Is this call as good as I think it is?

1155
01:47:01,373 --> 01:47:03,216
Yeah, I think it is.

1156
01:47:05,878 --> 01:47:07,676
Scary, but...

1157
01:47:08,547 --> 01:47:09,719
Yeah!

1158
01:48:03,102 --> 01:48:05,025
That's something else.

1159
01:48:05,354 --> 01:48:06,401
Which is it? Which one is it?

1160
01:48:09,858 --> 01:48:11,235
 It's all of them.

1161
01:48:14,822 --> 01:48:16,415
It's all of them!

1162
01:48:23,038 --> 01:48:24,210
It's Aurora Borealis,

1163
01:48:24,581 --> 01:48:28,302
it's northern lights, it's all of them.
And there isn't enough to point.

1164
01:48:36,844 --> 01:48:38,846
 Okay, I love you.
- I love you too.

1165
01:49:04,204 --> 01:49:05,251
Hector,

1166
01:49:05,622 --> 01:49:07,499
 you're a warrior!

1167
01:49:15,966 --> 01:49:17,559
Would you take me to the airport, please?

1168
01:49:19,928 --> 01:49:21,225
Warrior.

1169
01:49:28,353 --> 01:49:29,775
Jesus,

1170
01:49:30,731 --> 01:49:32,404
I love you.
- I love you.

1171
01:49:32,816 --> 01:49:36,195
Bye, bye, bye.
- I'll ship your bags. Go!

1172
01:49:36,612 --> 01:49:37,864
Passport!

1173
01:49:57,257 --> 01:49:59,555
 How was your journey?
What did you learn?

1174
01:50:01,929 --> 01:50:03,931
It was amazing, amazing.

1175
01:50:04,264 --> 01:50:08,644
I'm so ready to go home, to get back to my girl

1176
01:50:09,019 --> 01:50:11,192
my work.
I can't wait to tell my patients.

1177
01:50:11,855 --> 01:50:12,947
Tell them what?

1178
01:50:14,066 --> 01:50:18,242
That we all, all of us, have the capacity to be happy.

1179
01:50:19,905 --> 01:50:21,703
 Higher than that, Hector.

1180
01:50:25,410 --> 01:50:29,210
That we all have the right to be happy?

1181
01:50:39,675 --> 01:50:40,892
I see.

1182
01:50:42,177 --> 01:50:44,396
We all have an obligation to be happy.

1183
01:50:59,361 --> 01:51:04,367
Once upon a time, there was a young psychiatrist called Hector.

1184
01:51:04,741 --> 01:51:06,869
He was very satisfied with his life.

1185
01:51:08,203 --> 01:51:11,002
Far be it from me, and forgive me for asking,
and I don't mean to pry,

1186
01:51:11,373 --> 01:51:13,751
but can this plane go any faster?

1187
01:51:27,514 --> 01:51:30,393
It's me, it's me, it's me!
- Hector!

1188
01:51:34,188 --> 01:51:36,282
 His world was complex,

1189
01:51:36,690 --> 01:51:39,034
 sometimes even chaotic.

1190
01:51:43,697 --> 01:51:44,994
 And he liked it that way.

1191
01:51:48,327 --> 01:51:52,628
 He took comfort in the rich random patterns of his life.

1192
01:51:54,791 --> 01:51:56,509
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Oh, man!

1193
01:51:56,877 --> 01:52:00,507
 He listened to his patients with real patience.

1194
01:52:03,383 --> 01:52:04,976
 If you see what I mean.

1195
01:52:06,094 --> 01:52:08,847
 Sometimes with surprising results.

1196
01:52:09,223 --> 01:52:11,521
It looks, it looks acceptable.

1197
01:52:14,436 --> 01:52:19,237
Now then, Anjali, beware the ego's need of shaping halucinations.

1198
01:52:20,317 --> 01:52:24,663
Looks like someone's ego shaped a beautiful naked Chinese girl.

1199
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:29,827
What?

1200
01:52:30,744 --> 01:52:34,044
I won't pretend that...
- That's tight, no more pretending.

1201
01:52:35,082 --> 01:52:36,004
Right.

1202
01:52:46,718 --> 01:52:48,095
Gotcha!

1203
01:52:50,305 --> 01:52:51,557
Okay, you'll pay for that!

1204
01:52:53,183 --> 01:52:54,526
The other way. Go to the rear.

1205
01:52:56,436 --> 01:52:57,608
My girlfriend is coming.

1206
01:52:58,438 --> 01:53:00,782
 Everything was up for change.

1207
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:05,613
 Including Hector.

1208
01:53:24,339 --> 01:53:27,218
 And he learnt to love,

1209
01:53:28,010 --> 01:53:31,264
 like he'd never loved before!
