No! No.

168
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,216
You can't just come out
with a question like that.

169
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,264
You have to build up to it.

170
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,779
You know you have
to have a preamble.

171
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,928
Alright, alright.
I'm sorry.

172
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,890
Do you consider yourself
to be happy?

Forgive me for asking,
and I don't mean to pry.

178
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:47,537
But... do you consider yourself
<i>as</i> a happy person?

179
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:51,543
Is this because I'm not ready
to be a mother?

180
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,545
- Other hand, please.
- Absolutely not.

181
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,547
- But I've only done the left one.
- Sorry.

182

This has nothing... nothing to do
with you not being a mother.

I know what you're saying, Hector.

184
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:10,688
No one wants to live with a person
knowing they'll never be happy.

- Yes.
- And you can...

Channel what's to come.
See the future. Yes.

188
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,413
- Mm-hmm.
- Give me your hand.

189
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,662
- Oh, not again.
- Please. Come on.

Wait, are we off the clock?

191
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,704
- Call it even.
- Cool.

192
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,585
But you are getting a bargain.
I charge more than you.

193
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,587
I keep telling you,
you should put up your fees.

kept hidden from me.

That's what this whole trip's
been all about, am I right?

Jesus, Clara,
she's not a skank, okay?

She's a psychologist.
Not to mention the pregnant mother

- of two beautiful children.
- Ouch!

1297
01:31:09,047 --> 01:31:11,095
That really hurt, Hector.
You know it did.

Oh, that is the lamest
fucking thing I've ever heard.

- You want to talk about it?
- Have we met?

Oh, right, you're Hector,
of course, you don't.

1345
01:33:29,896 --> 01:33:32,319

- Right, Agnes...
- Uh, yeah.

1347

I knew you were going to
ask me about this

1348
01:33:36,653 --> 01:33:38,826
- and I thought about it last night.
- Uh-huh.

1349
01:33:39,823 --> 01:33:44,875
I have never felt so happy, really.

1350
01:33:44,953 --> 01:33:48,674
Or exhausted. I mean, the chaos,
sometimes it's out of control.

1351
01:33:48,748 --> 01:33:50,625
But, you know,
I have a job I love

1352
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:54,713
and a husband I love
and two beautiful kids I love.

1353
01:33:54,796 --> 01:33:56,469
A home I love.

1354
01:33:56,548 --> 01:33:59,518
The only real shadow
on my happiness

1355
01:33:59,592 --> 01:34:02,562
is when I tell myself
it's too good to last.

1356
01:34:02,637 --> 01:34:06,483
And, Hector, the marriage,
whatever the marriage is,

1357
01:34:06,558 --> 01:34:08,936
the marriage itself
is never in question.

1358
01:34:09,018 --> 01:34:11,817
And that makes me happy.

1359
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:22,532
What?

1360
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:27,208
I don't know, it's just...

1361
01:34:27,287 --> 01:34:28,630
You know...

1362
01:34:29,956 --> 01:34:31,583

what might have been.

1363
01:34:38,173 --> 01:34:39,174

01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:47,561
Agnes.

1365
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:49,517
- What?
- Never mind, forget it.

1366
01:34:49,601 --> 01:34:50,853
It's not even worth discussing.

1367
01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:53,313
Oh, come on, what?

1368
01:34:53,396 --> 01:34:55,398
What might have been?
God!

1369
01:34:55,481 --> 01:34:58,234
How about what is right now?

1370
01:34:59,319 --> 01:35:02,698
It just suits you, doesn't it,
holding on to a fantasy?

1371
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:04,908
You know when you put someone
on a pedestal or on hold

1372
01:35:04,991 --> 01:35:06,914
or to the side or whatever
you want to call it.

1373
01:35:06,993 --> 01:35:08,415
Do you think
that's a compliment?

1374
01:35:08,494 --> 01:35:10,622
Because it's not.
It's the opposite.

1375
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:14,175
And you know why?
Because I am not that fantasy.

1376
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:16,844
I'm better than that fantasy.
I am real.

1377
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:18,467
I got married.

1378
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:20,969
I had a baby,
and then another one,

1379
01:35:21,049 --> 01:35:22,551
and I'm having another one.

1380
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:24,181
And do you think I wanted
it to be Hector there

1381
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:27,309
cutting the umbilical cord?
No, because Hector

1382
01:35:27,388 --> 01:35:31,564
would throw up and then faint
because you're squeamish.

1383
01:35:31,643 --> 01:35:34,487
You're emotionally squeamish.

1384
01:35:34,562 --> 01:35:37,236
You really are some kind
of weird psychiatrist,

1385
01:35:37,315 --> 01:35:39,613
- you know that, right?
- I... Where's...

1386
01:35:39,692 --> 01:35:44,243
Oh, I'm trying so hard here to
avoid the words "move"and "on",

1387
01:35:44,322 --> 01:35:46,324
but, for crying out loud,
I am just,

1388
01:35:46,407 --> 01:35:49,832
"Oh, ﬂag that woman for,
I don't know, 12 years.

1389
01:35:49,911 --> 01:35:51,913
Yeah, get back to that one
when the time's right."

1390
01:35:51,996 --> 01:35:54,090
So, nothing, nothing,
nothing, nothing,

1391
01:35:54,165 --> 01:35:56,964
then, "Hi! I'm in Africa.
See you Monday."

1392
01:35:57,043 --> 01:35:59,443
I mean, I'm just some kind of
box you had to check, aren't I?

1393
01:35:59,504 --> 01:36:01,097
No...

1394
01:36:14,102 --> 01:36:15,729
I did love you, Hector.

1395
01:36:20,942 --> 01:36:23,695
But I love Alan now.

1396
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:27,783
Guess what?

1397
01:36:27,865 --> 01:36:31,711
Whatever it is you think
you're in love with...

1398
01:36:31,786 --> 01:36:33,709
it's not me.

Oh, dear, oh, dear,

How many of us, I wonder,
can recall

1406
01:37:22,337 --> 01:37:27,264
a childhood moment
when we experienced happiness

1407

<i>as</i> a state of being?

1408
01:37:29,177 --> 01:37:32,932
That single moment
of untarnished joy.

1409
01:37:33,014 --> 01:37:39,647
That moment when everything
in our world inside and out...

1410
01:37:41,314 --> 01:37:43,863
was alright.

1411
01:37:43,941 --> 01:37:47,161
Everything was alright.

1412
01:37:51,032 --> 01:37:54,206
But, now, we become
a colony of adults

1413
01:37:54,285 --> 01:37:57,585
and everything is all wrong
all the time.

It's <i>as</i> if we were on a quest

on our own personal happiness,

1417

the more it eludes us.

1418
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:12,395
In fact, it's only when
we are otherwise engaged,

Oh, no.

1423
01:38:26,943 --> 01:38:28,820
We should concern ourselves

1424
01:38:28,903 --> 01:38:31,907
not so much with the pursuit
of happiness,

1425
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:35,334
but with the happiness
of pursuit.

1426
01:38:36,119 --> 01:38:40,625
But how do we
measure happiness?

A new frontier in its infancy,
but not for long.

Functional electrical impedance

My portal into the mysterious

Emotions that
for the very first time,

1437
01:39:13,364 --> 01:39:18,040
we can separate, specify
and quantify in actual units.

Now, this male subject
is Japanese.

1439
01:39:21,122 --> 01:39:23,545
Look at the abundance
of bright orange

1440
01:39:23,624 --> 01:39:27,595
around the happiness area,
verging on ecstasy.

1441
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:30,549
It's <i>as</i> if the brain

eleven hours later,

verging on suicide,

1447
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:47,524
otherwise known
as an excruciating hangover.

1448
01:39:47,607 --> 01:39:51,987
Ask yourselves,
is this worth that?

1449

You first, Agnes.

- Oh, yes, we made a deal.

1452

Helmet on.

1454
01:40:06,667 --> 01:40:09,341
I want you to imagine yourself
in three situations.

1455
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:12,094
One that makes you
very happy, one very sad,

1456
01:40:12,173 --> 01:40:15,222
and one very scared.
Recent memories can be useful.

1457
01:40:15,384 --> 01:40:19,560
Do not tell me the order,
I will guess it myself.

- Your turn, Hector.
- Okay.

1469

Get over yourself.
You weren't in any of mine.

Oh, right.

Sit, my dear.

1472
01:41:20,533 --> 01:41:23,127
By way of identifying
the emotions,

1473
01:41:23,202 --> 01:41:26,627
I've assigned a color to each
corresponding part of the brain.

1474
01:41:26,706 --> 01:41:28,083
It's pretty obvious, really.

1475
01:41:28,165 --> 01:41:30,759
Sunny yellow, happy,
ice blue, sad,

That's odd.

It's as if he's filtering,

Something's holding him back,
some kind of barrier.

(STAMMERING) I have
