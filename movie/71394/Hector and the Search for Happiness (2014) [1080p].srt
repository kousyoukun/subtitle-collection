1
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:19,099
Clara.

2
00:03:20,475 --> 00:03:21,522
Hector!

3
00:03:22,561 --> 00:03:24,279
Morning, sweetheart.
- Morning.

4
00:03:25,063 --> 00:03:27,441
Time to rise, time to shine!

5
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:37,660
<i>Once upon a time there was a 
young psychiatrist called Hector,</i>

6
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:41,543
<i>who had a very satisfactory life.</i>

7
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:44,045
<i>His world was tidy,</i>

8
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,176
<i>uncomplicated.</i>

9
00:03:50,005 --> 00:03:51,848
<i>And he liked it that way.</i>

10
00:03:56,845 --> 00:04:00,270
<i>He took great comfort in 
its predictable patterns.</i>

11
00:04:04,102 --> 00:04:07,732
<i>Patterns, his girlfriend Clara
 was happy to maintain.</i>

12
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,656
Thank you. Bye.

13
00:04:18,784 --> 00:04:20,582
<i>Any lapse was swiftly rectified.</i>

14
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:58,244
TINTIN
THE BLUE LOTUS

15
00:04:58,615 --> 00:05:00,709
<i>Hector had a great deal 
of patience for his patients,</i>

16
00:05:01,576 --> 00:05:03,169
<I>if you see what I mean.</I>

17
00:05:03,578 --> 00:05:08,004
Everyday I ask myself: How could my
marriage just explode the way it did?

18
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:10,169
<i>And, like all the best psychiatrists,</i>

19
00:05:10,752 --> 00:05:13,255
<i>he knew how to answer a 
question with a question.</i>

20
00:05:13,672 --> 00:05:17,302
Jane,
what does "exploding" mean to you?

21
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:22,440
It's no good! I've lost my psychic mojo. 
I just can't see a way out.

22
00:05:23,181 --> 00:05:25,650
All my clients leave me.

23
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,981
Hector, look at me, I want the truth.

24
00:05:31,356 --> 00:05:34,200
Do you see my light? Here?

25
00:05:35,277 --> 00:05:36,824
Please don't lie to me.

26
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,121
I see your point.

27
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:44,708
<i>His patients never crossed
 paths with each other.</i>

28
00:05:45,996 --> 00:05:47,589
<i>They couldn't.</i>

29
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:53,929
<i>Once in a while,  Hector prescribed pills
 with funny sounding names. </i>

30
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:57,053
Roger,
have you taken your meds?

31
00:05:57,466 --> 00:06:00,345
I am a fucking Ferrari!
- What?

32
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:03,935
<i>Experimenting until he'll end it upon
 the one most suitable.</i>

33
00:06:04,306 --> 00:06:07,606
Roger
- Two fat ladies, 88!

34
00:06:08,977 --> 00:06:11,321
<i>His clients always returned.</i>

35
00:06:11,688 --> 00:06:15,568
<i>They gave his name to their friends,
 who gave his name to their friends.</i>

36
00:06:19,654 --> 00:06:23,875
<i>After all, Hector's rates were very fair. 
They haven't changed in years.</i>

37
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:30,087
<i>Come to think of it. Neither had Hector.</i>

38
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:34,886
And if that wasn't enough.

39
00:06:35,253 --> 00:06:39,008
Within six days, our Clara discovers 
the name for a companion drug,

40
00:06:39,424 --> 00:06:43,349
which had eluded the marketing 
department for six months.

41
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,472
Now that's the talent for words!

42
00:06:46,056 --> 00:06:48,809
But what I love most about her,

43
00:06:49,184 --> 00:06:51,437
is that in the ten years 
she has been with us,

44
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:56,071
she has yet to discover the words
 "maternity" or "leave".

45
00:07:02,697 --> 00:07:04,540
Thank you all so much!

46
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:09,212
What's in a name?
Glamor of hope?

47
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:15,215
A chance for change. - That's right. 
- A way to alleviate suffering.

48
00:07:15,877 --> 00:07:18,801
It's been five years since we
 launched Tranquiline.

49
00:07:19,631 --> 00:07:23,101
Correction. No, it's been a lifetime for
 those who benefited from it.

50
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:26,097
From me emotional, to marketing.

51
00:07:26,805 --> 00:07:29,775
I love you guys!
Here is to making a difference!

52
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:32,143
To making money!

53
00:07:45,657 --> 00:07:47,330
Not me! Not me!

54
00:07:49,088 --> 00:07:50,161
Come on!

55
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,290
Give her some money!

56
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,339
Twenty pounds!

57
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:00,964


58
00:08:05,802 --> 00:08:07,304
What should I do?

59
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:15,528
You're intriguing me.

60
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:19,196
You are not working with these people?

61
00:08:19,608 --> 00:08:22,327
No, no.
I'm Hector. I am a psychiatrist.

62
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:25,156
Psychiatrist!

63
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,999
You can help me?

64
00:08:28,325 --> 00:08:29,417
I think not!

65
00:08:29,784 --> 00:08:32,128
But I want a penis.

66
00:08:33,204 --> 00:08:36,208
A penis.
- You mean happiness!

67
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:41,176
Everybody want a penis,
but you cannot hold a penis.

68
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:46,310
Yes, sorry. It's elusive, yes.
You can't touch happiness.

69
00:08:46,718 --> 00:08:50,894
You cannot touch a penis.

70
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:55,360
<u>!</u>

71
00:08:56,895 --> 00:08:57,862
Hector!

72
00:08:58,229 --> 00:09:03,827
I want a penis in my bottom of the heart.

73
00:09:04,194 --> 00:09:07,414
No, no. You want happiness, from the bottom of your heart.

74
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:10,876
That is what I said. A penis.

75
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,462
In my bottom.

76
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:16,422
Stop it!

77
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,094
Oh, Gosh!

78
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:28,139
I love my Hector.
- I love my Clara.

79
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:29,598
<u>No, I mean it.</u>

80
00:09:30,053 --> 00:09:33,182
I love my weird, eccentric,

81
00:09:33,598 --> 00:09:36,727
nobody is like him Hector.

82
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,688
Promise me, you'll never change.

83
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:48,785
Thank you for humoring all my friends.

84
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,032
You know, I would do the same for you.

85
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,750
I don't have any friends.
- Of course you do, Hector.

86
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,888
Back off Malcolm, that's not funny.

87
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:18,234
HECTOR SOCKS

88
00:10:51,676 --> 00:10:52,973
Give me your hand.

89
00:10:55,096 --> 00:10:58,020
No, see? Nichts! Nothing!

90
00:10:58,433 --> 00:11:02,233
I can still, you know,
 talk the talk like you do, Hector.

91
00:11:02,604 --> 00:11:04,948
Like the way you answer 
a question with a question.

92
00:11:05,315 --> 00:11:06,441
What do you mean?

93
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,528
There, that's it.

94
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:11,951
You are so transparent, Hector.

95
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,078
Am I?
-You have your noncommittal nonsense,

96
00:11:14,449 --> 00:11:18,170
I have my New-Age-Waffle,
I can serve up to any client.

97
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:21,673
"Your mother had a hard life"
Tell me what mother hasn't has a hard life?

98
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,965
Or "You are going on a journey."
I feel like a fraud.

99
00:11:31,674 --> 00:11:33,517
Don't tell me you don't know
 what I am talking about.

100
00:11:34,302 --> 00:11:40,605
Every day, just going through the motions, 
never been authentic.

101
00:11:41,643 --> 00:11:42,815
Authentic!

102
00:11:45,814 --> 00:11:49,068
You know what, Anjali? I think this
 represents some sort of growth.

103
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,408
You know, just be careful 
that when you have

104
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:55,703
these visions, hallucinations,

105
00:11:56,074 --> 00:12:00,079
that the ego might just be
 shaping them to its own needs.

106
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:06,255
Let's try the medication for another week, 
shall we?

107
00:12:09,838 --> 00:12:11,431
But the tumor's benign.

108
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:13,141
ahhmm..
yeah.

109
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,019
Yes or no?

110
00:12:18,346 --> 00:12:19,142
Yes..

111
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,017
Also

112
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:24,856
this is not even a cancer story.

113
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,452
Hector,

114
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,084
you seem a little blue,
not your usual self.

115
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,044
Is it Roger?

116
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:50,137
No, no. Actually, Ben,
 it's my other patients.

117
00:12:50,545 --> 00:12:52,639
You know,
 they all like to think they are hopeless.

118
00:12:54,048 --> 00:12:55,846
That's hopeless.

119
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,557
Are you happy?

120
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:11,358
You are breaking up with me, aren't you?
- No!

121
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:15,328
You can't come up with a question
 like that, you have to build up to it.

122
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:18,907
You know you have to have a preamble.
- Alright, alright, I'm sorry.

123
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,161
Do you consider yourself to be happy?

124
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,081
Alright, look.

125
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,508
I've got it.

126
00:13:30,627 --> 00:13:34,131
Far be it from me, 
and forgive me for asking,

127
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:38,177
and I don't mean to pry, but

128
00:13:39,594 --> 00:13:42,143
do you consider yourself as

129
00:13:43,097 --> 00:13:44,849
a happy person?

130
00:13:45,808 --> 00:13:49,312
Is this cause I am not ready to
 be a mother? Other hand, please.

131
00:13:49,604 --> 00:13:51,777
Absolutely not.
- But you don't have any on the left one.

132
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:56,949
Sorry. This is nothing,
 nothing to do with you not being a mother.

133
00:13:59,697 --> 00:14:01,699
I know what you're saying, Hector.

134
00:14:04,118 --> 00:14:08,089
No one wants to live with a person
who will never be happy.

135
00:14:12,043 --> 00:14:14,216
So you are...
- Back in business, yes.

136
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:19,009
And you can...- Channel what's to come.
 See the future, yes.

137
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,761
Give me your hand.
- No, not again!

138
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:23,896
Please! Come on!

139
00:14:24,806 --> 00:14:27,605
Wait, are we off the clock?
- Call it a day. - Cool.

140
00:14:27,976 --> 00:14:30,980
But you are getting a bargain.
 I charge more than you. I'm telling you,

141
00:14:31,354 --> 00:14:32,822
you should put up your fees.

142
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:39,495
You're going on a journey.

143
00:14:40,238 --> 00:14:41,239
Am I?

144
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:46,002
Be serious.

145
00:14:46,327 --> 00:14:48,295
I am. You are.

146
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,172
To distant lands.

147
00:14:56,421 --> 00:14:58,094
What is... Anything else?

148
00:15:00,341 --> 00:15:02,514
I see you at peace. I see you happy.

149
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:04,262
Really?

150
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:08,934
I see you loving like you 
have never loved before.

151
00:15:15,273 --> 00:15:16,445
Yeah, well.

152
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:19,111
Maybe in my next life.
- Hector,

153
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,613
this is your next life.

154
00:15:24,032 --> 00:15:26,660
I see you with a dead dog. - What?
- You are a little boy, you are crying.

155
00:15:27,035 --> 00:15:28,662
Oh my god, you were an only child,

156
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:31,961
a lonely child you poor thing.
No, it makes sense.

157
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,964
Your life, how exhausting.

158
00:15:35,293 --> 00:15:37,546
I see a girl on a beach.
- What do you mean a girl?

159
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:40,056
Why didn't you ever call her?
- What do you mean, call her?

160
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,592
Are you sterile?
- No, I am not sterile!

161
00:15:42,925 --> 00:15:46,600
No, no, wait, that's not it.
It's your life. Why am I getting sterility?

162
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:52,060
Someone is hurting you, making you angry.
- Time's up. - It's you.

163
00:15:52,477 --> 00:15:55,526
It's you. You are making you angry.
- This session... Just stop, ok, stop!

164
00:15:55,897 --> 00:15:58,400
Stop projecting.
I am not the patient here, Anjali.

165
00:15:58,775 --> 00:16:01,119
So exhausting, exhausting. Yes, yes, yes,
 so exhausting. I know, I know.

166
00:16:01,486 --> 00:16:03,614
Exhausting. Thank you,
 I'll see you next week. Thank you.

167
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:07,079
Who is Agnes?

168
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,298
I can't sell the house. 
The cracks are back.

169
00:16:14,624 --> 00:16:16,968
They had taken it off the menu,
 the evening was ruined.

170
00:16:17,293 --> 00:16:19,270
The only reason to go there 
was the white pie.

171
00:16:19,587 --> 00:16:21,462
I'm thinking of taking in 
other people's laundry.

172
00:16:21,463 --> 00:16:23,463
To get some extra cash,
 to help pay for the nanny.

173
00:16:23,674 --> 00:16:25,347
Otherwise we are going under.

174
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,512
I was doing the exercises
 but I fell asleep.

175
00:16:27,845 --> 00:16:29,813
And now the sergeant says
 I am not standing straight.

176
00:16:30,181 --> 00:16:32,604
Nobody bought me a birthday
- present I actually wanted.

177
00:16:32,934 --> 00:16:35,357
I bought him odor away...
- ... but his feet really are a problem.

178
00:16:36,187 --> 00:16:38,986
Nipples just aren't an
 erogenous zone for men.

179
00:16:39,482 --> 00:16:41,359
I'm gonna have to cut the 
nanny down to five days a week.

180
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,863
<u>It is a losing battle.
- I am at the end of my rope.</u>

181
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:56,635
the end of your rope.

182
00:16:56,752 --> 00:16:59,346
The end of your rope?

183
00:16:59,454 --> 00:17:00,509
I'll give you a rope.

184
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:04,910
A child, witnessing his parents 
gunned down in a drive by shooting.

185
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:05,510
That is a rope.

186
00:17:05,842 --> 00:17:09,221
A midwife, in Africa, trying to 
deliver babies with no running water.

187
00:17:09,637 --> 00:17:10,604
That is a rope.

188
00:17:10,972 --> 00:17:14,168
TinTin, literally, at the end of his rope.

189
00:17:14,376 --> 00:17:15,775
Does he cut the rope to save his own life,

190
00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:18,570
or does he hold on to stop his friend 
from falling to a certain death?

191
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:21,271
Cut the rope, TinTin, cut the rope!

192
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,703
Jane! Jane!

193
00:17:27,155 --> 00:17:30,534
I'm sorry.
I'm very very sorry.

194
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:33,119
I don't know what came over me.

195
00:17:33,995 --> 00:17:35,292
Same time next week?

196
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:40,130
I have to take my daughter
 sailing for a couple of days.

197
00:17:41,085 --> 00:17:44,510
Yes, yes I do remember. You were
 mentioning that. So, following week?

198
00:17:45,715 --> 00:17:46,807
Still won't be back.

199
00:17:49,218 --> 00:17:50,265
You said a couple of days.

200
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:51,645
Yes.

201
00:17:54,599 --> 00:18:00,106
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

202
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,826
This is not a couple of days, ok,
this is ten days holiday, Jane!

203
00:18:05,193 --> 00:18:06,615
Fucking own it!

204
00:18:24,128 --> 00:18:24,970
Malcolm.

205
00:18:27,924 --> 00:18:29,767
Malcolm, you stupid bastard.

206
00:18:32,553 --> 00:18:33,930
Give me the fucking remote!
Give me that!

207
00:18:40,645 --> 00:18:41,692
Jackass!

208
00:18:50,446 --> 00:18:52,073
"Euphoralan"?

209
00:18:52,448 --> 00:18:53,700
"Solarton"?

210
00:18:54,075 --> 00:18:56,077
As in "a ton of sun".

211
00:18:56,327 --> 00:18:59,206
"Apollonax"?
No, that's the wrong list.

212
00:18:59,497 --> 00:19:01,249
No, that's funny,
that's for August.

213
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,009
Erectile dysfunction.

214
00:19:03,584 --> 00:19:04,961
What do you think?

215
00:19:05,336 --> 00:19:08,055
"Apollonax"? Apollo and his Axe.

216
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,560
I need to get away.

217
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:18,691
Take a trip.

218
00:19:20,434 --> 00:19:24,359
I'm not making my patients any happier,
and I just...

219
00:19:25,356 --> 00:19:27,199
I need to do some research.

220
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:28,526
On what?

221
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:30,411
Happiness.

222
00:19:30,778 --> 00:19:32,246
Otherwise I can't help.

223
00:19:33,447 --> 00:19:36,075
Look at my life, Clara.

224
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,249
I feel like such a fraud.
You know, like a...

225
00:19:39,662 --> 00:19:42,836
An armchair traveler
dishing out worldly advice.

226
00:19:45,668 --> 00:19:48,512
When?
- Soon, very soon. Now.

227
00:19:48,879 --> 00:19:51,175
You know, there is no way I 
can get the time off, I mean not now.

228
00:19:51,176 --> 00:19:53,976
Not this time of the year.

229
00:19:55,636 --> 00:19:56,728
I know.

230
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:04,695
I'm sorry.

231
00:20:05,062 --> 00:20:07,440
Okay, I am sorry.
I really, really am.

232
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,527
Will you be here when I get back?

233
00:20:12,486 --> 00:20:13,738
How long will you be gone?

234
00:20:16,657 --> 00:20:18,250
I don't know.

235
00:20:20,036 --> 00:20:22,664
Then I can't answer the question,
can I?

236
00:20:31,756 --> 00:20:33,178
I think you're right.

237
00:20:33,591 --> 00:20:37,312
I think I just went slightly off the
 map with the all TinTin reference.

238
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,347
Now don't get me wrong.

239
00:20:39,722 --> 00:20:41,895
There is real value to your inner TinTin.

240
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:43,645
My what?

241
00:20:43,746 --> 00:20:46,646
Your inner TinTin.
The boy scout in you.

242
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,897
Don't ever lose it.

243
00:20:48,272 --> 00:20:50,821
It is just a...
How can I put this.

244
00:20:52,276 --> 00:20:55,746
Just as long as TinTin
 isn't driving the bus.

245
00:20:57,156 --> 00:21:01,627
Where are you thinking of going on this
 journey of yours?  I was thinking China.

246
00:21:02,912 --> 00:21:04,255
China!

247
00:21:10,461 --> 00:21:11,804
Brilliant!

248
00:21:12,129 --> 00:21:14,803
Sleeves, removable.
- Obviously.

249
00:21:15,257 --> 00:21:18,511
Trousers, convertible.
- Obviously. - Hat,

250
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,604
reversible.
- Obviously.

251
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:24,688
And in case of emergencies.
- God forbid!

252
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:27,687
Passport, Imodium,
Antihistamine, nose strips

253
00:21:28,062 --> 00:21:29,814
Remember, avoid dairy.
- Yes.

254
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:34,319
Got enough socks?
- Yes, I think so.

255
00:21:34,985 --> 00:21:36,953
I don't wanna over pack it.

256
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:38,906
And you know, it all fits.

257
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:41,580
Neat and tidy. Like us.

258
00:21:43,994 --> 00:21:45,041
What's like us?

259
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,877
Tidy.

260
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:50,335
It's like who we are, tidy.

261
00:21:50,751 --> 00:21:54,722
It's like that's our agreement, isn't it?

262
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,012
Hector.

263
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:00,595
I get it.

264
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:04,144
If you're gonna do this, do it totally.

265
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:05,771
Make it worthwhile.

266
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,436
You have my permission, alright?

267
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,362
Really?

268
00:22:10,938 --> 00:22:13,111
Really. I mean it.

269
00:22:14,191 --> 00:22:15,443
Totally.

270
00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:19,239
Come here, Sir.

271
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:33,510
Arms up please, Sir.

272
00:22:46,891 --> 00:22:49,986
You sit in my seat.
- Pardon?

273
00:22:50,352 --> 00:22:53,902
I make in internet booking weeks ago.
- I don't know. What are you? 39G?

274
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:55,741
Should he go on my lap?

275
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,952
Look, there is obviously some sort of
mix-up. I'll do whatever you want.

276
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,038
Let me go and check.

277
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,867
This way, Sir.

278
00:23:05,743 --> 00:23:07,916
Your seat.
- Okay.

279
00:23:08,662 --> 00:23:09,709
Great.

280
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,050
Sorry, could you move your bags? Sorry.
- Champagne, Sir?

281
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:15,211
Is the Pope circumcised?

282
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,592
What do you mean?

283
00:23:23,177 --> 00:23:26,681
Can I please get the champagne for 
first class at least? Decent one.

284
00:23:27,014 --> 00:23:29,062
I doubt that.
- This isn't decent?

285
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:31,819
Down or memory-foam?
- What? - The pillow.

286
00:23:32,186 --> 00:23:35,565
Did you order memory-foam?
- I forget. Did I?

287
00:23:36,357 --> 00:23:38,405
Sorry, it's my little joke.
- I'm sorry, Sir,

288
00:23:38,776 --> 00:23:41,325
I'm going to need to store your bag.
- Of course. Please do.

289
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,164
Sorry.

290
00:23:48,577 --> 00:23:51,171
I got it.
Oh, God, it's like Twister..

291
00:23:51,455 --> 00:23:52,923
You won.

292
00:23:56,794 --> 00:23:57,841
Thank you.

293
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,938
That's sweet.

294
00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:14,232
Look at that. HECTOR'S SEARCH 
FOR HAPPINESS A JOURNEY

295
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:17,531
It's a gift. It's from my other half.

296
00:24:17,898 --> 00:24:20,651
She must have smuggled it into my bag.

297
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:21,993
"Fill these pages."

298
00:24:26,657 --> 00:24:28,284
I will.

299
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:06,872
Anything from duty-free, Sir?
- Yes, please, actually.

300
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,867
I'd like the "Keep it handy travel candy" 
please.

301
00:25:10,492 --> 00:25:12,836
Immigration form?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

302
00:25:28,886 --> 00:25:33,107
Give it back. Costed more than your car.
- Thank you.

303
00:25:37,978 --> 00:25:39,651
Sorry.
- Don't worry, Sir.

304
00:25:40,022 --> 00:25:44,323
The glass is unbreakable.
- Very clever, unbreakable.

305
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:49,873
Unbreakable.

306
00:25:55,829 --> 00:25:57,297
Sorry.

307
00:25:57,915 --> 00:26:01,294
Are you sure there is no room in 
first class? - Sorry, Sir.

308
00:26:09,995 --> 00:26:14,591
1. MAKING COMPARISONS CAN SPOIL 
YOUR HAPPINESS

309
00:26:30,531 --> 00:26:31,748
Wife?

310
00:26:32,241 --> 00:26:35,836
Old flame. University.
- We all got one of those.

311
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:37,838
First time in China?

312
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,416
Yeah.
- Business or pleasure?

313
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:44,091
Research, actually. I'm a psychiatrist.

314
00:26:45,129 --> 00:26:47,632
I want to know what makes people happy.

315
00:27:04,815 --> 00:27:06,112
Hector.

316
00:27:07,818 --> 00:27:08,990
Edward.

317
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,197
Watch yourself.
- Okay.

318
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:23,171
Thank you.

319
00:27:27,337 --> 00:27:28,884
<u>He fucking has got my fucking pen!</u>

320
00:27:30,632 --> 00:27:33,260
Edward! I still have your pen!

321
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:37,477
I'm fine, I'm fine. Alright.

322
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:39,646
Wait!

323
00:27:43,062 --> 00:27:45,281
I can't thank you enough.
- Where are you staying?

324
00:27:45,647 --> 00:27:48,867
The Marriot.
- The Marriott, for happy?

325
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:50,907
Well, it was central.

326
00:27:51,528 --> 00:27:53,405
What, you've got any other suggestions?

327
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,287
Let me show you happy.

328
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:55,472
Whoever said "Money can't buy happiness",

329
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:57,144
fuck you!

330
00:28:57,553 --> 00:28:59,650
This is incredible, this
is incredible! Just

331
00:28:59,675 --> 00:29:01,957
incredible! The whole
thing, the meal, my room,

332
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:03,775
Edward, I'm just, I'm curious, okay.

333
00:29:04,852 --> 00:29:09,028
Far be it from me, and forgive me for 
asking, and I don't mean to pry,

334
00:29:09,439 --> 00:29:12,067
Time is money, spit it out!
- Right, are you happy?

335
00:29:12,442 --> 00:29:14,865
When you work as much as I do, you don't 
have time to ask yourself that question.

336
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:17,619
And that's why I'm thinking of quitting.

337
00:29:18,198 --> 00:29:21,668
What, now?
- God, no. In another 20 million.

338
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:25,418
I have been saying that for
 the last 100 million.

339
00:29:26,415 --> 00:29:27,667
<u>You bust the god, you earn enough money,</u>

340
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,300
you retire, you do something you like.

341
00:29:33,463 --> 00:29:36,433
Or nothing at all.
- And then you are happy?

342
00:29:38,927 --> 00:29:42,932
Yeah. Or addicted, divorced or dead.

343
00:29:43,473 --> 00:29:44,690
What the hell.

344
00:29:48,896 --> 00:29:52,491
You pick a goal, you work towards it,
makes you feel better.

345
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:54,451
Just keep moving, that's my motto.

346
00:29:54,985 --> 00:29:57,454
Maybe there is only one way
 to retire and be happy.

347
00:29:57,821 --> 00:29:59,198
And what's that?

348
00:30:00,073 --> 00:30:01,450
Don't retire!

349
00:30:04,286 --> 00:30:08,041
It's time for some real China. Come on.
- Really? Okay.

350
00:30:08,665 --> 00:30:11,009
I just take a bit of this.

351
00:30:14,755 --> 00:30:17,224
It's not what you know, actually. 
It's not who you know.

352
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:20,432
It's how much you pay, who you know.

353
00:30:37,444 --> 00:30:39,788
Hey, Minnie! How are you?

354
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,710
Hey, Jens. - Hey, Edward.
- I thought you'd be back to Berlin!

355
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:51,300
This is Valerie, she's from Paris.

356
00:31:02,719 --> 00:31:04,471
What are you doing?

357
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,563
I'm...
- Are you a writer?

358
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:12,233
No, I’m just, I'm taking some notes.

359
00:31:18,068 --> 00:31:20,947
"2. A lot of people think,
 happiness means being richer,

360
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,784
or more important."

361
00:31:25,826 --> 00:31:27,749
Do you believe that?
- Well, I wouldn't know,

362
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,088
I'm not rich and I'm not important.

363
00:31:31,665 --> 00:31:34,259
What a coincidence, neither am I.

364
00:31:37,045 --> 00:31:38,922
"The search for happiness."

365
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,060
Is it, Ancona?

366
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:46,180
No.

367
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:50,142
Perhaps, over there.

368
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:55,277
No, no, no. That's torture for me,
I don't dance. - Why not?

369
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:58,901
You don't like move your body a little bit?

370
00:31:59,276 --> 00:32:02,405
Come on, it's fun.
- You know what, it's...

371
00:32:03,864 --> 00:32:07,539
Or, is it right here?

372
00:32:08,785 --> 00:32:10,662
In your smile.

373
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,344
My name is Ying Li. I am a student.

374
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:20,843
Hector.

375
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:24,017
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

376
00:32:26,636 --> 00:32:28,183
Oh, sorry, too long.

377
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:34,812
So, what do you study, Ying Li?
- Tourism.

378
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:36,484
I am a tourist.

379
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:38,482
What a coincidence!

380
00:32:51,078 --> 00:32:53,126
Edward!
- Having a good time?

381
00:32:55,123 --> 00:32:56,500
Yeah!

382
00:32:57,959 --> 00:32:59,927
I have no idea what I was thinking.

383
00:33:00,295 --> 00:33:02,423
Do the next. Listen to this.

384
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:04,471
"3. Many people only see happiness,

385
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,801
only in their future."

386
00:33:08,011 --> 00:33:09,763
I will drink to that!

387
00:33:10,138 --> 00:33:11,640
Cheers!

388
00:33:12,808 --> 00:33:17,530
<u>Hey! I have an idea, I have an idea.
Who is available tomorrow night.

389
00:33:17,854 --> 00:33:22,030
let's mark the bottle!
- You are cheating! - I'm not cheating!

390
00:33:23,443 --> 00:33:27,573
I'm not cheating!
I'm ticking the bottle! - You are cheating!

391
00:33:27,948 --> 00:33:31,168
Lighten up! Alright, alright, alright...

392
00:33:39,042 --> 00:33:40,794
Will I see you again?

393
00:33:41,128 --> 00:33:42,880
What hotel are you staying at?

394
00:33:43,213 --> 00:33:44,965
Hyatt on the Bund.

395
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,887
What a coincidence.

396
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:51,688
We are driving to the Hyatt on the Bund.
Thank you.

397
00:33:54,641 --> 00:33:56,735
Welcome back to Hyatt on the Bund.

398
00:34:15,704 --> 00:34:19,208
Well, I'm not sure what the custom is for,

399
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:23,219
escorting a young lady to, a room.

400
00:35:01,249 --> 00:35:03,047
I'll be right back.

401
00:35:25,565 --> 00:35:27,909
I'm not sure what the custom is,

402
00:35:29,486 --> 00:35:31,409
for undressing in front of...

403
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,832
Hector?

404
00:37:18,011 --> 00:37:20,514
<i> This is Hector.
- Did you have a good time, last night?</i>

405
00:37:20,847 --> 00:37:23,771
Yeah, you know happy.
I gotta go.

406
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,488
I'd really like to take you to lunch.

407
00:37:29,105 --> 00:37:30,357
Really?
- Yeah.

408
00:37:31,232 --> 00:37:34,782
You pick.
Just text me when and where.

409
00:37:47,783 --> 00:37:52,079
4. HAPPINESS COULD BE THE FREEDOM TO LOVE
MORE THAN ONE WOMAN AT THE SAME TIME.

410
00:38:11,564 --> 00:38:14,113
Welcome!
Explore this substance.

411
00:38:14,776 --> 00:38:15,993
Yes. Great!

412
00:38:16,903 --> 00:38:18,075
I like it.

413
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,842
What are you doing?
- Nothing.

414
00:38:37,543 --> 00:38:38,839
Hi!
- Hi!

415
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:46,479
Listen! This is China, you're Chinese,
I'm clueless.

416
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,561
I need to go to the mountains.
Why don't you come with me?

417
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:52,856
Too soon?

418
00:38:53,481 --> 00:38:55,233
Preamble, Hector, preamble!

419
00:38:55,525 --> 00:39:00,156
No. It's just,
you're different. You're kind.

420
00:39:01,281 --> 00:39:02,498
I'm not used to it.

421
00:39:07,495 --> 00:39:09,497
They look very happy.

422
00:39:10,165 --> 00:39:12,322
They're with their friends.
Why are they sitting

423
00:39:12,347 --> 00:39:14,239
in the middle of the street?
- Thank you.

424
00:39:14,627 --> 00:39:16,880
They have nowhere else to go.
It's their day off.

425
00:39:17,213 --> 00:39:19,557
They have no money,
to sit in cafes.

426
00:39:19,883 --> 00:39:21,885
They send all to their families.

427
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,887
So, they meet here on the street.

428
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:26,557
They come from the countryside like I do.

429
00:39:27,515 --> 00:39:29,734
My sisters and mother are still there.

430
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:34,197
Look at them, they're like a happy little
island in a see of grim businessmen.

431
00:39:34,564 --> 00:39:36,066
Makes you wonder.

432
00:39:36,524 --> 00:39:40,870
Hey, listen. Your mother and your sisters,
we could pay them a visit,

433
00:39:41,237 --> 00:39:43,239
on our trip.

434
00:39:45,325 --> 00:39:47,248
Oh, Hector.

435
00:39:48,411 --> 00:39:51,836
The difference between those 
cleaning ladies and me,

436
00:39:53,416 --> 00:39:57,216
is that, there is no shame in how 
they make their money.

437
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,349
They can show their faces back home.

438
00:40:05,303 --> 00:40:06,771
I can't.

439
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,437
Why is that, then?

440
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:15,355
Ying Li!

441
00:40:19,526 --> 00:40:20,573
Hey, wait!

442
00:40:21,074 --> 00:40:22,870
Sorry! Sorry!

443
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:28,335
Your friend paid for last night,
who is paying for today?

444
00:40:33,414 --> 00:40:35,792
You seemed so real.
You tricked me.

445
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:37,419
You tricked me!

446
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,173
What're you doing? What're you...

447
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:53,769
Ying Li!

448
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:20,066
5. SOMETIMES, HAPPINESS IS
 NOT KNOWING THE WHOLE STORY

449
00:43:09,946 --> 00:43:11,493
It's Monday. We are closed.

450
00:43:11,864 --> 00:43:15,164
Yeah, but, I've come a very long way.
I'm a psychiatrist.

451
00:43:15,576 --> 00:43:18,500
I'm trying to discover what 
makes people happy.

452
00:43:18,871 --> 00:43:19,918
It's Monday. We are closed.

453
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:25,136
Okay, okay! Look, far be it from me,
and forgive me for asking, 
and I don't mean to pry,

454
00:43:25,545 --> 00:43:28,515
but, would you consider yourself 
to be a happy person?

455
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:32,177
What part of Monday don't you understand?

456
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:38,065
Trainee, he has a lot to learn.
Would you like to come in?

457
00:43:38,474 --> 00:43:40,602
Yes, please,
cause I might not be around next week.

458
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:45,023
The moment of death is indeed uncertain!
Now, come in!

459
00:43:51,738 --> 00:43:54,161
Come come, quick!
- Okay.

460
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:06,674
When you've been a fugitive,
you've been in prison for your beliefs,

461
00:44:06,919 --> 00:44:08,887
you've lost your family and loved ones...

462
00:44:09,172 --> 00:44:12,426
I mean, you've just been through so much.
How is it you're so happy?

463
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,894
Because I've been through so much.

464
00:44:16,345 --> 00:44:18,439
My search for happiness is one thing,

465
00:44:18,765 --> 00:44:20,938
but making it the goal just 
doesn't work, does it?

466
00:44:21,309 --> 00:44:23,232
Higher than that, Hector!

467
00:44:25,104 --> 00:44:29,826
More important than what we 
are searching for, is what we're avoiding.

468
00:44:30,193 --> 00:44:35,199
Like unhappiness. So,
don't make unhappiness not the goal.

469
00:44:35,573 --> 00:44:37,200
Higher than that!

470
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,755
Avoiding unhappiness is
 not the road to happiness.

471
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:46,259
You hold all the cards, Hector.

472
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:01,556
6. AVOIDING UNHAPPINESS
IS NOT THE ROAD TO HAPPINESS

473
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:10,491
It's very noble this book you're writing.

474
00:45:10,858 --> 00:45:13,862
When you've reached the end of it,
 come back to me.

475
00:45:14,237 --> 00:45:16,786
I would like to see,
what you have learned.

476
00:45:17,156 --> 00:45:20,080
Right, you mean, when I'm just
 passing through this area again.

477
00:45:20,827 --> 00:45:23,671
We have Skype. Skype me!

478
00:45:24,831 --> 00:45:26,504
You have Skype?

479
00:45:31,105 --> 00:45:34,801
Hi!
- Hector? - Hi!

480
00:45:36,592 --> 00:45:38,219
How is it going? How is work?

481
00:45:38,636 --> 00:45:42,686
<i>It's great! Can you believe it, 
they're going with "Apollonax"!</i>

482
00:45:43,057 --> 00:45:45,560
<i>Market research says it is the 
biggest erection they've had... Sorry, sorry.</i>

483
00:45:45,893 --> 00:45:49,443
<i>Reaction, they had after a survey
 in ten years.</i>

484
00:45:52,191 --> 00:45:55,035
<i>Clara, look where I am. I'm in a monastery.
- Where you belong!</i>

485
00:45:56,654 --> 00:45:57,826
<i> How was Shanghai?</i>

486
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:02,293
Yeah, I've made friends with a rich banker,
and he took me around town. And we...

487
00:46:02,702 --> 00:46:05,251
<i>Now you know any kind of 
happiness money can buy?</i>

488
00:46:15,715 --> 00:46:18,093
<i>It's weird seeing you like this.
You look really small.</i>

489
00:46:30,062 --> 00:46:33,908
Hector, come come!
You have to see! The wind! Come!

490
00:46:57,798 --> 00:47:00,176
Hector! Look!

491
00:47:01,427 --> 00:47:02,349
Do you see?

492
00:47:04,055 --> 00:47:05,557
All of them!

493
00:47:16,943 --> 00:47:19,492
Looks like we've lost the sun, Tey.

494
00:47:22,031 --> 00:47:24,033
Best keep moving, shall we?

495
00:47:40,007 --> 00:47:41,224
Thank you.

496
00:47:41,884 --> 00:47:44,478
Poor bastard. I'm sorry.

497
00:47:45,888 --> 00:47:48,141
Where to next?
- Africa.

498
00:47:48,849 --> 00:47:52,774
For happy?
- Or unhappy. I've to wait and see.

499
00:47:54,146 --> 00:47:56,444
You're a very very strange person, Hector.

500
00:47:56,732 --> 00:47:59,201
A kind of person normally
 I avoid like the plague.

501
00:48:01,654 --> 00:48:04,282
Glad I didn’t, buddy.

502
00:48:05,574 --> 00:48:07,542
Thank you, Edward. I mean it.

503
00:48:21,841 --> 00:48:27,063
Sir, you do realize that this is four flights?
That is two days. - Absolutely.

504
00:48:27,805 --> 00:48:31,275
And last flight is not so...
It is not exactly...

505
00:48:31,726 --> 00:48:34,149
Absolutely.
- Let me put it this way:

506
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:36,947
First Class.

507
00:48:37,523 --> 00:48:38,695
Business Class.

508
00:48:38,983 --> 00:48:40,235
Economy.

509
00:48:42,611 --> 00:48:43,487
You.

510
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,492
Bring it!

511
00:48:55,249 --> 00:48:56,842
Oh my god!

512
00:49:00,546 --> 00:49:02,924
If you look at this plane,
you'll notice it's quite old.

513
00:49:03,299 --> 00:49:07,054
That means it's never crushed before.
Should be quite reassuring.

514
00:49:08,304 --> 00:49:10,477
Thank you, I think.

515
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,525
From this point forwards, I'll be nicer 
to my patients who are afraid to fly.

516
00:49:16,896 --> 00:49:19,900
Are you a doctor?
- I'm a psychiatrist, yeah.

517
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:22,864
So, I assume you've read this?

518
00:49:23,486 --> 00:49:25,739
Yeah, yeah I'm familiar 
with Coreman from my UCLA days.

519
00:49:26,113 --> 00:49:27,786
He was just making a name for himself.

520
00:49:28,157 --> 00:49:31,627
Quite a name! I saw him on CNN.
What do they call him?

521
00:49:31,994 --> 00:49:35,544
"The Einstein of happiness".
I've read it twice.

522
00:49:35,915 --> 00:49:40,512
You can keep it. I like it, but I don't think 
I'll need it as much as the country it was written for.

523
00:49:40,878 --> 00:49:41,879
Thanks.

524
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:44,340
Oh my god! This isn't safe!

525
00:49:49,637 --> 00:49:52,686
Do you have children? Are you married?
- No.

526
00:49:53,057 --> 00:49:54,229
Why not?

527
00:49:54,809 --> 00:49:59,861
Why do I get the feeling, there is a woman out 
there in the world asking herself the very same question?

528
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:02,108
You know, there is really only
 one question:

529
00:50:02,483 --> 00:50:05,111
7. Does this person bring you 
predominantly:

530
00:50:05,486 --> 00:50:08,706
A) Up or B) Down?

531
00:50:19,125 --> 00:50:21,844
"Side effects may include happiness.".

532
00:50:22,795 --> 00:50:24,422
So, what about you?

533
00:50:24,797 --> 00:50:26,891
What makes for your happiness?

534
00:50:27,258 --> 00:50:29,431
Home, family,

535
00:50:30,136 --> 00:50:32,355
the idea that my children
 can live a normal life,

536
00:50:32,721 --> 00:50:35,224
without bodyguards taking them to school.

537
00:50:37,309 --> 00:50:41,485
Have you ever had sweet-potato stew?
Really sweet-potato stew!

538
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,364
You have to!
Here's the tip:

539
00:50:45,734 --> 00:50:48,863
If we land safely,
one night this week, my mother's house,

540
00:50:49,238 --> 00:50:52,412
my whole family,
sweet-potato stew.

541
00:50:55,161 --> 00:50:57,505
There will be a tomorrow, my friend.

542
00:51:05,921 --> 00:51:07,468
I'll be right back.

543
00:51:10,759 --> 00:51:14,229
Why don't you let me do this?
- That's very kind.

544
00:51:16,182 --> 00:51:20,562
Oh, God, hold it up! Hold it up!
Get the button!

545
00:51:20,936 --> 00:51:21,812
Hector!

546
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:25,942
Michael, Jesus! Help!

547
00:51:26,484 --> 00:51:28,327
Can anyone...
I have a Swiss Army knife.

548
00:51:28,694 --> 00:51:32,449
Oh, dear!
- This is Marcel. He's our bodyguard.

549
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:33,550
Hi!
- Hector?

550
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:35,792
Welcome.

551
00:51:36,535 --> 00:51:39,414
The car is scarce here,
so better take precautions.

552
00:51:39,788 --> 00:51:41,131
Okay, let's go!

553
00:51:49,715 --> 00:51:51,888
See? You haven't changed.

554
00:51:53,594 --> 00:51:54,641
Neither have you.

555
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:58,065
I mean, look at you!
Hector goes to Africa.

556
00:52:00,184 --> 00:52:03,529
You and Aggy, you seemed so solid.
What happened with that?

557
00:52:05,064 --> 00:52:08,159
Hey, Agnes and I always knew you'd end
 up here when the dust settles.

558
00:52:08,526 --> 00:52:10,199
Yep, all this.

559
00:52:11,278 --> 00:52:12,825
This was my calling, wasn't it.

560
00:52:13,197 --> 00:52:16,167
You know, the dust as you put it, 
never really settles.

561
00:52:16,534 --> 00:52:19,413
<u>There's been progress, though, right?
I mean, foreign aid. That was on my blink,</u>

562
00:52:19,787 --> 00:52:23,212
there is another fundraiser.
- There is a big difference between being here,

563
00:52:23,624 --> 00:52:25,843
and being here to be
 photographed being here.

564
00:52:26,168 --> 00:52:28,512
The money doesn't always make it
to where it's needed most.

565
00:52:28,796 --> 00:52:31,265
It never leaves the city. It's useless.
- It's useless.

566
00:52:31,799 --> 00:52:36,475
Still long ways to go, Hector.
But hey, that's why we are here, right?

567
00:52:57,324 --> 00:52:59,918
Have a good night's rest, okay!
- Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

568
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:04,089
Don't give that many to them,
they'll never leave you alone!

569
00:53:04,665 --> 00:53:08,215
Hector, we'll pick you up at six,
and go straight to the clinic, okay?

570
00:53:08,627 --> 00:53:10,004
See you tomorrow!

571
00:53:14,717 --> 00:53:16,060
ALL VISITORS AND GUEST

572
00:53:16,468 --> 00:53:18,470
ARE KINDLY REQUESTED TO LEAVE 
THEIR WEAPON WITH RECEPTION

573
00:53:32,359 --> 00:53:33,656
Good evening.

574
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:37,247
What sort of beers you have?

575
00:53:41,994 --> 00:53:43,211
Thank you.

576
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:48,634
I think you might need a bigger sign outside.
Some people might be missing it.

577
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:53,339
Hey guys! He wants to know 
how is the peace keeping going.

578
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:58,470
You're here to save the planet?
Plant some trees?

579
00:53:59,094 --> 00:54:03,520
No, actually, I am here to help out
 to the Adulu clinic for a week or two.

580
00:54:04,099 --> 00:54:06,318
What's in it for you?

581
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:07,857
Nothing.

582
00:54:11,315 --> 00:54:13,534
Your English is very good.
Where are you from?

583
00:54:13,901 --> 00:54:15,824
Wanna see my passport?

584
00:54:22,201 --> 00:54:24,169
I prefer your hair the way it is now.

585
00:54:27,247 --> 00:54:29,921
That's good. I liked that.

586
00:54:30,959 --> 00:54:32,632
So, what brings you here?

587
00:54:33,587 --> 00:54:35,430
Farming.
- Farming!

588
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:41,145
What kind? And would that be,
what makes you happy?

589
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:43,722
What are you, the fucking New York Times?

590
00:54:44,264 --> 00:54:46,858
No, I'm just researching 
what makes people happy.

591
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:54,028
If you're wearing a wire,
you're dead.

592
00:54:54,316 --> 00:54:57,536
And you know what?
No one will care.

593
00:54:59,238 --> 00:55:01,240
Okay. No wire.
Sorry for the shirt.

594
00:55:05,411 --> 00:55:08,540
My name is Hector. I'm a psychiatrist.
- Very well, Hector.

595
00:55:08,914 --> 00:55:11,508
I bet what I farm makes more people happy,

596
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:13,172
than to crap you dish out.

597
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:17,301
I see. Farmer.

598
00:55:17,715 --> 00:55:19,638
I get it. Drugs.

599
00:55:23,137 --> 00:55:27,062
Forgive me, but if your happiness 
causes other people's unhappiness,

600
00:55:27,474 --> 00:55:29,272
then how can that be happiness?

601
00:55:29,852 --> 00:55:31,604
Doesn't that bother you?

602
00:55:32,521 --> 00:55:35,866
I don't cause unhappiness,
I respond to it, same as you.

603
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:39,612
We both fill a need,
but they demand we don't create.

604
00:55:40,195 --> 00:55:42,414
Self-righteous fuckers.

605
00:55:43,532 --> 00:55:46,627
What's your solution?
Another embargo?

606
00:55:46,994 --> 00:55:51,215
So the country gets more poor,
people starve, babies die,

607
00:55:51,623 --> 00:55:54,251
and their leaders couldn't care less.

608
00:55:55,294 --> 00:55:58,889
If you wanna be happy,
take care of your own.

609
00:56:03,051 --> 00:56:04,519
So you're happy.

610
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:09,190
No.

611
00:56:10,017 --> 00:56:15,148
Because my wife is unhappy.
Which makes my kids unhappy.

612
00:56:15,522 --> 00:56:18,401
And if my family is not happy,

613
00:56:18,984 --> 00:56:21,328
how can I be happy?

614
00:56:23,489 --> 00:56:26,117
She sees a shrink.
He gave her something new,

615
00:56:26,492 --> 00:56:28,836
but it just makes her worse.

616
00:56:29,661 --> 00:56:32,335
Do you mind if I ask what she is taking?

617
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:34,796
I don't know.

618
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:38,049
Maybe, if you could show me the prescription,
I may help.

619
00:56:40,005 --> 00:56:42,224
Why?
- I'd like to.

620
00:56:42,633 --> 00:56:43,725
Bullshit.

621
00:56:44,051 --> 00:56:46,679
You need it for yourself,
like everyone else.

622
00:56:47,429 --> 00:56:51,309
Why would either of us wish to prolong
anyone else's misery?

623
00:56:53,185 --> 00:56:54,653
Fuck you!

624
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:12,288
<u>Holy Jesus. What's that?</u>

625
00:57:15,123 --> 00:57:19,924
<i> With patience and perseverance,
you can climb your mountain.</i>

626
00:57:38,856 --> 00:57:43,032
I don't like these dosages,
and these two clash.

627
00:57:43,944 --> 00:57:45,196
Let me...

628
00:57:46,572 --> 00:57:48,700
Sorry, me and pens...

629
00:57:50,242 --> 00:57:51,414
Thank you.

630
00:57:52,744 --> 00:57:55,998
This women is great. She's based in Bogota.
She's an old colleague of mine.

631
00:57:56,331 --> 00:57:59,175
Tell her that I referred your wife.
I think she's been over-medicated.

632
00:57:59,585 --> 00:58:03,089
It could be the source of her problem.
Here is my phone number.

633
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:06,217
Give me a call,
let me know how she goes.

634
00:58:07,259 --> 00:58:08,181
Thank you.

635
00:58:10,512 --> 00:58:12,935
Hector, it's past six,
we gotta go!

636
00:58:15,183 --> 00:58:17,606
What are you doing, even talking to him?

637
00:58:17,978 --> 00:58:19,776
That's Diego Baresco.

638
00:58:20,314 --> 00:58:23,409
That's a kind of guy that
drags his country to shit.

639
00:58:27,779 --> 00:58:31,409
So wait, you know that guy?
- Everybody knows Diego Baresco.

640
00:58:34,286 --> 00:58:36,755
Hector, really?

641
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:10,952
Hello, how is it going?

642
00:59:13,533 --> 00:59:15,877
Hello doc, how is it going?
- This is Hector.

643
00:59:17,871 --> 00:59:19,623
So, let's see.

644
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:23,882
How are you feeling?
Do you feel the baby move?

645
00:59:24,252 --> 00:59:26,880
Hello, Baruti.

646
00:59:27,255 --> 00:59:28,302
Do you feel okay?

647
00:59:29,466 --> 00:59:32,470
This is my friend, Hector.
He's gonna help us too.

648
00:59:32,803 --> 00:59:34,851
Just take a look.

649
00:59:35,764 --> 00:59:38,517
I don't hurt anymore.
Can I go home?

650
00:59:38,767 --> 00:59:40,360
You are not leaving until I say so.

651
00:59:40,894 --> 00:59:43,898
But my sister,
she needs me.

652
00:59:44,523 --> 00:59:47,026
Baruti lost his mother,
last month.

653
00:59:47,401 --> 00:59:49,403
Listen, if you're not well,

654
00:59:50,237 --> 00:59:52,080
you are no help to your sister.

655
00:59:53,031 --> 00:59:54,248
Good boy.

656
00:59:54,658 --> 00:59:56,285
Stay with him.
Just talk to him.

657
00:59:57,244 --> 00:59:58,746
What I can do.

658
01:00:01,957 --> 01:00:04,301
So, Baruti.

659
01:00:05,669 --> 01:00:07,637
How old is your sister?

660
01:00:11,675 --> 01:00:16,306
What? - Your face, it's funny.
It's like this...

661
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:23,445
Yeah, yeah.
That's my listening face.

662
01:00:24,271 --> 01:00:25,739
How about this?

663
01:00:28,608 --> 01:00:31,327
You're funny.
- Am I? Thank you very much.

664
01:00:33,488 --> 01:00:35,240
You're a big boy.

665
01:00:40,241 --> 01:00:42,837
9. HAPPINESS IS, ANSWERING YOUR CALLING

666
01:00:44,791 --> 01:00:46,338
He's gonna be okay.

667
01:00:48,086 --> 01:00:49,963
Absolutely...
Michael is a very...

668
01:00:51,673 --> 01:00:53,016
It's gonna be fine.

669
01:01:01,349 --> 01:01:03,852
Mama! Mama!

670
01:01:10,442 --> 01:01:11,785
Is that a...

671
01:01:12,569 --> 01:01:16,790
There is a lion over here.
These two lions, just, quite close.

672
01:01:18,617 --> 01:01:21,211
Excuse me. Excuse me!

673
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:26,842
Take off your Ipod, there is a lion really close by.
Is this normal? To have a lion...

674
01:01:32,843 --> 01:01:34,139
See you buddy.

675
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:44,651
You know, you could always stay a while.
We sure could use another medical doctor.

676
01:01:45,185 --> 01:01:47,279
It's tempting.
I've been watching you all week.

677
01:01:47,562 --> 01:01:50,657
You're a necessity.
Me, I'm just, I'm a luxury.

678
01:01:51,066 --> 01:01:52,363
I sometimes feel like,

679
01:01:52,776 --> 01:01:54,870
psychiatry comes with affluence, you know.

680
01:01:55,237 --> 01:01:59,617
The richer the city, the more psychiatrists 
there are per square mile. What does that tell you?

681
01:02:00,408 --> 01:02:02,831
It tells me you've been 
too hard on yourself.

682
01:02:05,038 --> 01:02:07,587
Come on, Hector,
it's not some kind of a competition.

683
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,213
The mind can hurt as much as the body, 
yeah?

684
01:02:15,757 --> 01:02:19,057
And maybe, if I seem happy,

685
01:02:20,345 --> 01:02:23,770
it's because I'm loved for who I am.

686
01:02:35,471 --> 01:02:36,367
Okay.

687
01:02:47,268 --> 01:02:50,564
9. HAPPINESS IS BEING LOVED FOR WHO YOU ARE

688
01:03:08,977 --> 01:03:10,524
<i> Hello!
- Hello!</i>

689
01:03:11,021 --> 01:03:12,147
I'm in Africa.

690
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:18,658
I'm with Michael. And he hasn't changed.
He looks exactly like he did in the photo I showed you.

691
01:03:18,945 --> 01:03:22,165
<i>You never showed me a photo of Michael.
- Didn't I?</i>

692
01:03:22,449 --> 01:03:24,042
<i>You just think you did.</i>

693
01:03:25,994 --> 01:03:28,964
I thought I had. Hey listen, Clara.

694
01:03:29,998 --> 01:03:33,423
<i>About that last conversation we had...
- Hi, boys!</i>

695
01:03:35,879 --> 01:03:38,428
Hey, guys! Back off! Jesus!

696
01:03:40,217 --> 01:03:43,562
This is private conversation. 
Seriously? Clara...

697
01:03:43,887 --> 01:03:45,730
<i> Hector, you know, I got it. It's fine.</i>

698
01:03:46,097 --> 01:03:47,974
<i> Let's not make it harder 
than it already is.</i>

699
01:03:48,350 --> 01:03:49,852
<i> Where're you going?
- Out.</i>

700
01:03:50,769 --> 01:03:52,066
<i>What, like that?
- No.</i>

701
01:03:52,479 --> 01:03:54,573
<i>No! In this. It's a work event.</i>

702
01:03:55,273 --> 01:03:58,026
I've never seen that dress.
That dress is new.

703
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:00,779
<i> I know. Oh, I gotta go. </i>

704
01:04:01,154 --> 01:04:02,701
<i> Bye Hector.
- What do you mean, bye?</i>

705
01:04:04,491 --> 01:04:05,583
Out.

706
01:04:08,084 --> 01:04:08,780
Okay.

707
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,047
Out.

708
01:04:12,249 --> 01:04:15,128
Hector! - Hey!
- You found it okay?

709
01:04:15,543 --> 01:04:19,047
You're literally get lost...
So, you're ready for sweet-potato stew?

710
01:04:19,464 --> 01:04:22,183
I have never been readier in my life!
- Welcome, welcome!

711
01:04:23,176 --> 01:04:24,723
Clear the way, you amateurs.

712
01:04:25,053 --> 01:04:28,353
Chef coming through. 
Chef with the severe case of...

713
01:04:28,723 --> 01:04:32,478
Tit for tat. The only difference is,
I don't need a sexy white dress.

714
01:04:35,105 --> 01:04:35,947
Alright, alright, alright.

715
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:40,490
There you go. - More wine.
- More wine, more wine.

716
01:04:41,111 --> 01:04:42,909
More wine! More wine!

717
01:04:48,535 --> 01:04:52,290
Have I ever said that how much I love this music.
I can almost dance. Almost!

718
01:04:53,164 --> 01:04:56,293
I see you, extremely pretty cousin.
Beware! Okay?

719
01:04:57,043 --> 01:04:58,090
I have permission.

720
01:05:03,174 --> 01:05:04,596
Cheers!

721
01:05:07,304 --> 01:05:11,354
I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you too. You're so beautiful.

722
01:05:11,725 --> 01:05:15,355
Thank you, thank you so very very much!
- Thank you my friend.

723
01:05:15,729 --> 01:05:17,481
Who's available tomorrow night?

724
01:05:18,773 --> 01:05:21,617
Bless you, my son!

725
01:05:23,069 --> 01:05:24,116
Bye!

726
01:05:30,201 --> 01:05:32,545
10. SWEET-POTATO STEW

727
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:35,586


728
01:06:07,781 --> 01:06:09,283
Give me the keys!

729
01:06:09,908 --> 01:06:11,660
And the hat, man!

730
01:06:58,706 --> 01:07:00,003
Keep it handy travel candy?

731
01:07:07,674 --> 01:07:09,051
You didn't pick me up!

732
01:07:09,467 --> 01:07:11,720
Why are you different?
Why are you both different?

733
01:07:12,178 --> 01:07:15,273
This is very strange!

734
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,108
What are you doing?

735
01:07:17,517 --> 01:07:18,609
What is this place?

736
01:07:31,573 --> 01:07:33,826
<i>You've got to understand, I'm a psychiatrist!</i>

737
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,043
I'm neutral, like Switzerland!

738
01:07:40,044 --> 01:07:42,340
11. FEAR IS IMPEDIMENT TO HAPPINESS

739
01:07:54,345 --> 01:07:55,437
Look.

740
01:07:55,763 --> 01:07:58,812
Look, can we just see this as one of those,

741
01:07:59,184 --> 01:08:02,233
sort of random events that's just 
deeply inconvenient for both of us?

742
01:08:03,062 --> 01:08:04,939
Get this piece of shit out of mu sight.

743
01:08:12,614 --> 01:08:14,742
No! Come back! No!

744
01:08:15,116 --> 01:08:16,663
Please don't go!

745
01:08:50,063 --> 01:08:52,663
<i> Losing a soldier.
There I will never be.</i>

746
01:09:06,664 --> 01:09:08,960
<i> Soldier go, soldier come.
Barrack remain.</i>

747
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:19,689
Tell me,
how much do you think we can get for him?

748
01:09:19,973 --> 01:09:22,226
Forget it,
he's already seen us, dickhead.

749
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,820
So, so, what do we do, boss?

750
01:09:27,564 --> 01:09:29,032
Let him rot!

751
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,894
"Keep it handy travel candy"

752
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:00,104
Nice.

753
01:10:01,055 --> 01:10:03,103
Once upon a time,

754
01:10:03,725 --> 01:10:06,228
there was a psychiatrist called Hector.

755
01:10:08,271 --> 01:10:10,444
Who was scared to death of dying,

756
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:13,409
before he never really lived.

757
01:10:18,281 --> 01:10:20,830
I'm sorry, I have never really been...

758
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,669
The thing is...

759
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:27,958
Would you mind giving me some privacy?

760
01:10:52,690 --> 01:10:54,317
<i>If you're going to do it, Hector,</i>

761
01:10:56,027 --> 01:11:00,999
<i>do it totally. 
She's yet discover the words "maternity" or "leave "</i>

762
01:11:02,325 --> 01:11:05,875
Yeah you need to find it yourself,
Like anyone else.

763
01:11:09,957 --> 01:11:11,129
You tricked me..

764
01:11:38,277 --> 01:11:40,325
<i> You hold all the cards, Hector.</i>

765
01:11:54,752 --> 01:11:56,925
Clara, Clara.

766
01:12:02,218 --> 01:12:03,720
Where are you taking me?

767
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:05,646
Please, please! I haven't done anything!

768
01:12:13,271 --> 01:12:14,488
This shit's funny, man.

769
01:12:15,481 --> 01:12:18,485
"Happiness is being loved for who you are."

770
01:12:22,238 --> 01:12:24,161
ClaraYingLi,
ClaraYingLi...

771
01:12:26,325 --> 01:12:28,419
What's this one?
It's been crossed out.

772
01:12:29,328 --> 01:12:33,253
It says "The evil you do in this
 life could cost you your happiness in the next."

773
01:12:35,001 --> 01:12:37,254
No, it doesn't, I'm sorry, I made that up.
It says:

774
01:12:37,587 --> 01:12:40,431
"Happiness could be the freedom to
 love two women at the same time."

775
01:12:45,636 --> 01:12:49,140
Look, look, look. I know that
 Police aren't gonna track me down.

776
01:12:49,557 --> 01:12:53,107
the thing is, I'm really trying to
 help a friend of mine whose wife is very ill.

777
01:12:53,519 --> 01:12:55,567
He's really counting on me.
If I just suddenly disappear,

778
01:12:55,938 --> 01:13:00,660
then he's gonna come looking for me
and you do not want this man as an enemy.

779
01:13:01,027 --> 01:13:04,031
Even if your friend is the president himself,
it wouldn't make a difference.

780
01:13:05,323 --> 01:13:08,167
Well, it's not the president,
it's Diego Baresco.

781
01:13:14,332 --> 01:13:15,925
Prove it.

782
01:13:18,085 --> 01:13:19,302
I can't.

783
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:24,934
Wait, no, no! I promise you,

784
01:13:25,009 --> 01:13:28,980
I know him. I know him. He's a friend of mine.
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

785
01:13:29,347 --> 01:13:30,473
I promise you.

786
01:13:30,807 --> 01:13:31,899
Shut up!

787
01:13:32,266 --> 01:13:33,768
Please!
- Why are you here?

788
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:36,362
I'm researching the state of happiness.
- Bullshit!

789
01:13:36,729 --> 01:13:38,151
No! God!

790
01:13:44,403 --> 01:13:48,874
I'm trying to find the ways
to make my patients happy.

791
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:52,875
Bullshit!
- God! Stop it! Please stop it!

792
01:13:56,666 --> 01:13:57,838
God!

793
01:13:59,919 --> 01:14:02,718
I wanna know if I can be happy.

794
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:28,994
This probably isn't the right moment, but I

795
01:14:30,449 --> 01:14:33,919
I just wonder what your personal
 idea of happiness is.

796
01:14:34,245 --> 01:14:36,247
You know, personally.

797
01:14:37,957 --> 01:14:40,460
If you want it, you take it!

798
01:14:41,335 --> 01:14:42,928
That's very insightful. I just want to...

799
01:14:43,254 --> 01:14:47,304
Would you mind if I just wrote that down?
Just for posterity?

800
01:14:51,137 --> 01:14:52,889
Give him the notebook.

801
01:15:05,651 --> 01:15:09,201
Oh, God!
I just never have a pen!

802
01:15:33,054 --> 01:15:37,605
One last thing, one final request,
I promise,

803
01:15:38,643 --> 01:15:40,691
Would one of you gentlemen mind,

804
01:15:41,062 --> 01:15:45,067
making sure this gold pen 
finds its way back to my dear friend,

805
01:15:45,441 --> 01:15:47,614
Diego Baresco?

806
01:17:04,415 --> 01:17:08,611
<i> With patience and perseverance,
you can climb your mountain.</i>

807
01:17:17,115 --> 01:17:21,011
12. HAPPINESS IS FEELING COMPLETELY ALIVE

808
01:17:22,329 --> 01:17:23,751
I'm alive!

809
01:17:24,957 --> 01:17:26,174
I'm alive!

810
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,817
Hello, Hector.

811
01:17:48,939 --> 01:17:50,486
I'm alive, too.

812
01:17:52,735 --> 01:17:55,864
What are you doing?
You are very beautiful.

813
01:17:57,281 --> 01:17:59,283
Very beautiful, but

814
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:01,998
let's just...
Dance!

815
01:18:15,716 --> 01:18:17,593
WELCOME BACK, HECTOR

816
01:18:37,404 --> 01:18:41,624
13. HAPPINESS, IS KNOWING HOW TO CELEBRATE

817
01:18:54,171 --> 01:18:56,048
<i>Hector?
- Clara! Hi!</i>

818
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:58,934
<i>Clara, I got kidnapped! Really!</i>

819
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:03,681
<i> Is that a cut? Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine, now. I nearly died.</i>

820
01:19:04,056 --> 01:19:06,229
<i>I thought about you so much.</i>

821
01:19:07,059 --> 01:19:09,608
<i>And?
- So very much.</i>

822
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:14,692
<i>Hector, why are you telling me this?
I just... What am I supposed to think?</i>

823
01:19:15,067 --> 01:19:17,195
<i>I don't hear from you for...</i>

824
01:19:18,863 --> 01:19:20,160
<i>Are you coming home?</i>

825
01:19:20,948 --> 01:19:23,326
<i>Not yet.
- Look, I've gotta go.</i>

826
01:19:25,119 --> 01:19:26,746
<i>Oh, no!
- What is it? What?</i>

827
01:19:27,121 --> 01:19:29,590
<i>I dropped the cup on the floor.
You see, that's what you do!</i>

828
01:19:29,957 --> 01:19:32,005
<i>I didn't do any...
- Tell me what you want.</i>

829
01:19:32,334 --> 01:19:36,134
<i>I'm not part of your project.
You just have to decide, Hector.</i>

830
01:19:36,547 --> 01:19:38,549
<i>Yes or no? Yes or no?</i>

831
01:19:39,216 --> 01:19:40,593
<i>I've got to go.</i>

832
01:19:40,968 --> 01:19:43,687
<i>Do you know where you're going next?
- No!</i>

833
01:19:48,767 --> 01:19:51,941
You know where you're going next?
- Yes, Los Angeles.

834
01:19:54,106 --> 01:19:55,028
Agnes.

835
01:19:56,442 --> 01:19:58,365
It's a work related matter.

836
01:19:59,153 --> 01:20:00,951
Unfinished business.

837
01:20:06,577 --> 01:20:07,829
So

838
01:20:08,787 --> 01:20:09,959
finish it.

839
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:16,588
Champagne, Sir?
Would you like the vintage?

840
01:20:16,921 --> 01:20:17,888
Why not?

841
01:20:19,798 --> 01:20:21,095
Madam, the vintage?

842
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:22,847
Why not?

843
01:20:25,721 --> 01:20:28,315
Why else do we travel first class?

844
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:35,109
TO DO - DONE

845
01:20:35,481 --> 01:20:37,904
FLY FIRST CLASS: DONE

846
01:20:44,657 --> 01:20:46,250
<i> Sorry to interrupt,
ladies and gentlemen, </i>

847
01:20:46,659 --> 01:20:49,913
<i> But if there is a doctor on board of this plane,
would you please contact the cabin crew.</i>

848
01:20:50,246 --> 01:20:51,623
<i> Thank you very much.</i>

849
01:20:52,248 --> 01:20:54,842
<i> Once again,
 if there is a doctor on board...</i>

850
01:21:10,432 --> 01:21:11,479
Please.

851
01:21:12,017 --> 01:21:14,566
Don't let them turn the plane around.

852
01:21:14,937 --> 01:21:17,907
I have to see my sister one last time.

853
01:21:18,607 --> 01:21:22,237
On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being
 the most pain you can imagine,

854
01:21:22,611 --> 01:21:23,828
Where will you place yourself?

855
01:21:26,657 --> 01:21:27,704
9..

856
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:32,128
I need to see the pilot.

857
01:21:34,123 --> 01:21:38,674
She had a massive tumor removed from her
 brain about 3 months ago, and the swelling is acute.

858
01:21:39,128 --> 01:21:41,301
Should we turn around?
- No, no, no.

859
01:21:41,714 --> 01:21:44,684
But if you can lower the
 altitude of the plane,

860
01:21:45,009 --> 01:21:47,758
it'd make a big difference on the pressure 
on her brain. Would be tremendous help to her..

861
01:21:47,886 --> 01:21:49,354
I'll check with air traffic control.

862
01:21:53,142 --> 01:21:57,147
And I've lived in 6 countries,
can you believe that?

863
01:21:57,521 --> 01:22:00,741
<i> Ladies and gentlemen,
please don't be concerned.</i>

864
01:22:01,108 --> 01:22:03,987
<i> We will be flying at a lower altitude
for the remainder of our journey. Thank you.</i>

865
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:07,290
Okay. It's gonna make a huge difference, alright?

866
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:10,956
Let's try to get that 9 down to a 5.

867
01:22:13,203 --> 01:22:14,204
Madam,

868
01:22:14,621 --> 01:22:18,000
Do you mind?
- If you must.

869
01:22:26,759 --> 01:22:27,681
Okay, may I?

870
01:22:47,738 --> 01:22:49,240
Do you have any children, doctor?

871
01:22:50,574 --> 01:22:51,951
No.

872
01:22:52,284 --> 01:22:56,585
My husband and I, it was our only regret.
We couldn't.

873
01:22:57,790 --> 01:22:59,417
But you know what?

874
01:22:59,792 --> 01:23:02,090
It was pretty good fun trying.

875
01:23:06,632 --> 01:23:07,929
Are you okay?

876
01:23:08,592 --> 01:23:10,720
There you go. It will pass.

877
01:23:14,014 --> 01:23:17,644
Okay now.
After my last surgery,

878
01:23:18,018 --> 01:23:21,488
I was in and out of consciousness for days.

879
01:23:22,022 --> 01:23:24,116
They said, I wouldn't make it.

880
01:23:24,483 --> 01:23:28,738
And, I remember the moment...

881
01:23:29,613 --> 01:23:31,206
I remember it totally.

882
01:23:31,573 --> 01:23:34,201
I was in a sand storm,

883
01:23:34,618 --> 01:23:36,541
walking with all these people,

884
01:23:36,912 --> 01:23:40,086
with our heads covered
and walking in the same direction.

885
01:23:40,958 --> 01:23:45,054
And I kept thinking to myself:
Why? Why am I in this group?

886
01:23:47,798 --> 01:23:52,099
I wasn't scared. I was,
I don't know, puzzled?

887
01:23:54,138 --> 01:23:58,609
And then, I heard my name being called:
"Djamila! Over here!"

888
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:01,608
And I looked to my right,

889
01:24:02,604 --> 01:24:05,858
and in the middle of an open space is was this,

890
01:24:06,859 --> 01:24:08,987
this beautiful...

891
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,446
How do you call it?

892
01:24:12,698 --> 01:24:14,200
Happy go round?

893
01:24:14,616 --> 01:24:17,290
Merry-go-round.
It's a carousel.

894
01:24:19,496 --> 01:24:22,841
And all the people,
that I know and love,

895
01:24:25,002 --> 01:24:27,255
were riding on this carousel.

896
01:24:30,090 --> 01:24:33,936
They were laughing, waving.

897
01:24:36,597 --> 01:24:38,645
Waving for me to join them.

898
01:24:47,024 --> 01:24:50,824
It took everything I had,
to run to them.

899
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:56,082
But I did it.

900
01:25:04,708 --> 01:25:07,882
It was my last ride, wasn't it?

901
01:25:12,674 --> 01:25:13,800
Yes.

902
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:16,308
That was your last ride.

903
01:25:33,612 --> 01:25:35,535
All those faces.

904
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:38,288
All those hearts.

905
01:25:44,248 --> 01:25:46,842
I'm such a lucky woman.

906
01:26:03,267 --> 01:26:06,897
<i> Ladies and gentleman,
 thank you once again for your cooperation.</i>

907
01:26:07,271 --> 01:26:09,649
<i> It made a big difference, believe me.</i>

908
01:26:17,489 --> 01:26:20,959
Don't take her to the hospital,
take her straight to this address.

909
01:26:21,285 --> 01:26:22,457
Are you gonna be okay?

910
01:26:28,709 --> 01:26:30,586
I am not afraid, Hector.

911
01:26:31,086 --> 01:26:34,556
People who are afraid of death,
are afraid of life.

912
01:26:37,342 --> 01:26:39,310
You have a real talent, you know.

913
01:26:40,345 --> 01:26:42,689
Not really my field.
- No,

914
01:26:42,973 --> 01:26:44,975
you misunderstand.

915
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:47,352
Listening is loving.

916
01:27:11,353 --> 01:27:15,649
14. LISTENING IS LOVING

917
01:28:02,761 --> 01:28:05,514
Of all the places you could have chosen,

918
01:28:12,729 --> 01:28:17,155
This beach, you know, this whole area,
it's just, it changed so much.

919
01:28:18,151 --> 01:28:20,529
Nostalgia is not what it used to be,
 Hector.

920
01:28:24,157 --> 01:28:25,204
You've been busy.

921
01:28:26,993 --> 01:28:28,165
Lily!

922
01:28:31,957 --> 01:28:33,004
Hey, baby.

923
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,126
Jack!

924
01:28:38,588 --> 01:28:40,090
Okay, you've been really busy.

925
01:28:40,841 --> 01:28:41,967
Kids,

926
01:28:42,551 --> 01:28:44,144
this is mommy's...

927
01:28:47,013 --> 01:28:48,686
Mommy's Hector.

928
01:28:58,859 --> 01:29:00,577
"Action Man".

929
01:29:01,695 --> 01:29:02,787
Hello.
- Hello.

930
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:06,287
Oh, God.

931
01:29:11,621 --> 01:29:14,591
I've got you seeing Professor Coreman tomorrow, you owe me.

932
01:29:14,958 --> 01:29:16,881
That guy is on a fast track to the Nobel.

933
01:29:17,169 --> 01:29:21,299
This happiness book is going through the roof.
- I know, I've read it. Somebody gave it to me. I liked it.

934
01:29:21,715 --> 01:29:22,841
Yeah, me too.

935
01:29:23,216 --> 01:29:27,221
I hate him. - We hate him.
Hate him. - Hate him.

936
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:31,729
Hey, I saw Michael.
- In Africa? Is he happy?

937
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:32,976
He's gay.

938
01:29:33,852 --> 01:29:35,695
Are you?
- Gay?

939
01:29:35,937 --> 01:29:38,611
No, happy.
I mean, is there someone?

940
01:29:39,316 --> 01:29:41,159
Yes. Clara.

941
01:29:42,194 --> 01:29:44,413
I may have fucked up.

942
01:29:47,574 --> 01:29:49,417
They can't hear.

943
01:30:04,299 --> 01:30:05,972
The Indiana Jones of happiness.

944
01:30:07,344 --> 01:30:09,688
Alan! Very nice to meet you.

945
01:30:10,055 --> 01:30:14,435
Me too. - Hector wants to know the secret to a happy marriage.

946
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:16,528
From the mathematician?

947
01:30:37,707 --> 01:30:39,459
Hi.
- Hey, I'm in L.A.!

948
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:42,930
I knew it! You're with sock drawer!
- Sock draw?

949
01:30:43,213 --> 01:30:45,307
That skank in the sock drawer,
 in the photo.

950
01:30:45,590 --> 01:30:48,139
The one you have kept hidden from me.

951
01:30:48,552 --> 01:30:50,771
That's what this whole trip's been all about,
 am I right?

952
01:30:51,972 --> 01:30:55,772
Jesus, Clara, she's not a skank, okay?
She's a psychologist!

953
01:30:56,142 --> 01:30:58,565
Not to mention the pregnant mother 
of two beautiful children.

954
01:30:59,229 --> 01:31:00,481
Au!

955
01:31:01,940 --> 01:31:03,942
That really hurt, Hector, you knew it did.

956
01:31:04,317 --> 01:31:08,788
She's my oldest friend, alright?
What were you doing in my sock drawer anyway?

957
01:31:09,155 --> 01:31:10,998
Packing away your socks!

958
01:31:11,992 --> 01:31:15,417
Before taking care of every
 other aspect of your life.

959
01:31:15,787 --> 01:31:18,040
<i> Maybe if you didn't assume 
I needn't so much taken care of</i>

960
01:31:18,456 --> 01:31:20,129
I've been taking care of myself.

961
01:31:20,542 --> 01:31:23,421
You know what "smothering" is, Clara?
It's "smothering, with an "s"!

962
01:31:23,795 --> 01:31:28,175
That's the lamest fucking thing I have
ever heard. And you get paid for this?

963
01:31:28,592 --> 01:31:30,594
Yeah, but at least I don't make a living

964
01:31:30,927 --> 01:31:34,807
making up meaningless, manipulative 
names for seriously dodgy drugs.

965
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:38,318
Is this call as bad as I think it is?

966
01:31:39,561 --> 01:31:41,859
Yes. Yes, I think it is.

967
01:31:43,315 --> 01:31:46,239
Fine! At last a decision.

968
01:31:46,610 --> 01:31:48,829
I can get on with my meaningless life.

969
01:31:49,195 --> 01:31:50,321
Oh, shi...

970
01:31:50,739 --> 01:31:52,036
God!

971
01:32:06,755 --> 01:32:08,553
Darling. Sweetheart.

972
01:32:09,132 --> 01:32:10,805
Where is my fucking pen?

973
01:32:12,510 --> 01:32:13,807
Diego

974
01:32:14,179 --> 01:32:18,480
It's here. Actually, I've got it.
It saved my life.

975
01:32:18,850 --> 01:32:21,444
<i>How are you, anyway? How is she?
- Very good.</i>

976
01:32:21,895 --> 01:32:25,900
I feel like I got my wife back.
And a lot more.

977
01:32:28,610 --> 01:32:32,160
What's the name of your friends clinic?
The one who hates me.

978
01:32:32,948 --> 01:32:37,169
Adulu-Clinic, why?
- I wanna make a donation. Anonymous, of course.

979
01:32:37,535 --> 01:32:38,832
What's in it for you?

980
01:32:40,163 --> 01:32:41,210
Nothing.

981
01:32:42,582 --> 01:32:43,629
Good man!

982
01:32:44,084 --> 01:32:46,132
Go fuck yourself!

983
01:33:06,773 --> 01:33:08,992
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

984
01:33:10,610 --> 01:33:13,238
How did the call go with Clara?

985
01:33:14,114 --> 01:33:16,833
Horrendous. Terminal.

986
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:19,749
I'm sorry. Wanna talk about it?

987
01:33:20,286 --> 01:33:23,836
Have we met?
- Alright, you are Hector. Of course you don't. What was I thinking?

988
01:33:25,291 --> 01:33:29,341
Right, Agnes.
- I knew you were gonna ask me about this,

989
01:33:29,754 --> 01:33:31,552
and I thought about it last night.

990
01:33:32,924 --> 01:33:37,600
I have never felt so happy, really.

991
01:33:37,929 --> 01:33:41,183
Or exhausted, I mean. The chaos,
 sometimes it's just out of control.

992
01:33:41,599 --> 01:33:45,229
But, you know, I have a job I love,
and a husband I love,

993
01:33:45,603 --> 01:33:48,777
and two beautiful kids I love,
a home I love.

994
01:33:49,149 --> 01:33:52,028
The only real shadow of my happiness

995
01:33:52,402 --> 01:33:54,825
is that when I tell myself 
it's too good to last.

996
01:33:55,196 --> 01:33:58,791
And Hector, the marriage,
whatever the marriage is,

997
01:33:59,159 --> 01:34:01,753
the marriage itself is never in question.

998
01:34:02,328 --> 01:34:04,456
And that makes me happy.

999
01:34:14,549 --> 01:34:16,051
What?

1000
01:34:17,761 --> 01:34:20,489
I don't know, it's just...
You know,

1001
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:24,190
Thinking about what might have been.

1002
01:34:30,857 --> 01:34:31,779
What?

1003
01:34:38,323 --> 01:34:39,415
Agnes.

1004
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:43,500
What? - Never mind. Forget it.
It's not even worth discussing.

1005
01:34:44,079 --> 01:34:45,581
Come on, what?

1006
01:34:45,955 --> 01:34:47,923
"What might have been?"

1007
01:34:48,249 --> 01:34:50,843
God, how about what is, right now?

1008
01:34:51,878 --> 01:34:54,973
It just suits you, doesn't it?
Holding out to a fantasy...

1009
01:34:55,340 --> 01:34:58,640
You know, when you put someone on a pedestal,
 or on hold, or to the side,

1010
01:34:58,968 --> 01:35:01,016
or whatever you wanna call it,
do you think that's a compliment?

1011
01:35:01,638 --> 01:35:04,517
Because it's not, it's the opposite.
And you know why?

1012
01:35:04,849 --> 01:35:09,480
Because I am not that fantasy.
I'm better than that fantasy. I am real!

1013
01:35:09,813 --> 01:35:11,065
I got married.

1014
01:35:11,356 --> 01:35:14,860
I had a baby, and than another one,
and I'm having another one.

1015
01:35:15,235 --> 01:35:18,455
And do you think I want it to be Hector there,
 cutting the umbilical cord? No!

1016
01:35:18,738 --> 01:35:21,241
Because Hector would throw up,

1017
01:35:21,741 --> 01:35:24,164
and then faint.
Because you're squeamish.

1018
01:35:24,577 --> 01:35:26,921
You're emotionally squeamish.

1019
01:35:27,247 --> 01:35:30,797
You really are some kind of...
weird psychiatrist, you know that right?

1020
01:35:32,877 --> 01:35:36,552
Trying so hard here to avoid the words "move" and "on"

1021
01:35:36,881 --> 01:35:42,263
For crying out loud!
I'm just, flag that women, I don't know, 12 years!

1022
01:35:42,679 --> 01:35:44,807
Yeah, get back to that woman
 when the time is right. So,

1023
01:35:45,181 --> 01:35:47,934
Nothing, nothing, nothing,
then, "Hi! I'm in Africa!"

1024
01:35:48,309 --> 01:35:51,984
"See you Monday!" I mean, I'm just some
 kind of box you had to check, aren't I?

1025
01:36:06,703 --> 01:36:08,205
I did love you, Hector.

1026
01:36:13,793 --> 01:36:16,171
But I love Alan now.

1027
01:36:18,173 --> 01:36:19,595
Guess what!

1028
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:23,349
Whatever it is you 
think you're in love with,

1029
01:36:24,512 --> 01:36:26,560
is not me.

1030
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:35,982
Come on, we're late.

1031
01:36:37,983 --> 01:36:40,079
15. NOSTALGIA IS NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE

1032
01:36:40,153 --> 01:36:41,621
... earning just the sort of wages

1033
01:36:42,322 --> 01:36:46,247
that would make your poor old mom proud.

1034
01:36:48,119 --> 01:36:49,621
And researchers

1035
01:36:49,996 --> 01:36:52,249
just love to tell us,

1036
01:36:53,082 --> 01:36:55,255
that money doesn't buy happiness.

1037
01:36:56,044 --> 01:36:59,344
I know what you're thinking,
how much do researchers make?

1038
01:37:00,465 --> 01:37:02,433
Everything in this world is going up.

1039
01:37:04,928 --> 01:37:10,230
And happiness is going down,
oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

1040
01:37:10,892 --> 01:37:16,524
How many of us, I wonder, can recall
that childhood moment

1041
01:37:17,232 --> 01:37:21,328
when we experienced happiness 
as a state of being.

1042
01:37:21,694 --> 01:37:24,948
That single moment of untarnished joy.

1043
01:37:25,281 --> 01:37:29,752
That moment when
everything in our world,

1044
01:37:30,119 --> 01:37:32,042
inside and out

1045
01:37:34,290 --> 01:37:36,008
was alright.

1046
01:37:36,793 --> 01:37:39,012
Everything was alright.

1047
01:37:44,050 --> 01:37:48,305
But now we've become a colony of adults
and everything is all wrong.

1048
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:50,557
All the time!

1049
01:37:51,891 --> 01:37:55,896
It's as if we were on a quest
to get it back.

1050
01:37:56,271 --> 01:37:59,525
And yet the more we focus 
on our own personal happiness,

1051
01:37:59,899 --> 01:38:06,077
the more it is useless. In fact,
it's only when we are otherwise engaged, you know,

1052
01:38:06,447 --> 01:38:10,168
focused on, absorbed , inspired, 
communicating, discovering, learning

1053
01:38:10,535 --> 01:38:12,333
dancing, for heavens sake

1054
01:38:12,745 --> 01:38:17,797
that we experience happiness 
as a by product, a side effect.

1055
01:38:18,126 --> 01:38:24,099
Oh no. We should concern ourselves 
not so much with the pursuit of happiness,

1056
01:38:24,716 --> 01:38:27,686
but with the happiness of a pursuit.

1057
01:38:28,845 --> 01:38:32,099
But how do we measure happiness?

1058
01:38:33,099 --> 01:38:36,023
Emotions are like colours, you know.

1059
01:38:36,436 --> 01:38:40,441
Difficult to explain once, but not now.
Not anymore.

1060
01:38:40,773 --> 01:38:46,405
All those who read auras, step aside!
This is science..

1061
01:38:47,071 --> 01:38:50,245
A new frontier, in its infancy,
but not for long.

1062
01:38:50,658 --> 01:38:55,129
Functional electrical impedance 
tomography by evoked response.

1063
01:38:55,830 --> 01:38:57,252
Or as I call it: Peeping Tom.

1064
01:38:58,333 --> 01:39:03,134
My portal into the mysterious 
details of human emotions.

1065
01:39:03,546 --> 01:39:06,766
Emotions, that for the very first time,

1066
01:39:07,091 --> 01:39:10,595
we can separate, specify and 
quantify in actual units.

1067
01:39:11,554 --> 01:39:12,976
This male subject is Japanese.

1068
01:39:13,348 --> 01:39:17,979
Look at the abundance of bright
 orange around the happiness area.

1069
01:39:18,353 --> 01:39:19,900
Verging on ecstasy.

1070
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:22,232
It's as if the brain was smiling.

1071
01:39:23,066 --> 01:39:24,192
Cause?

1072
01:39:24,567 --> 01:39:26,035
Half a liter of warm Sake.

1073
01:39:27,779 --> 01:39:29,031
And here we are again,

1074
01:39:29,405 --> 01:39:31,658
same Japanese gentleman,
eleven hours later.

1075
01:39:32,033 --> 01:39:36,334
The color of grim despondency,
verging on suicide.

1076
01:39:36,746 --> 01:39:39,124
Otherwise known as an 
excruciating hangover.

1077
01:39:39,582 --> 01:39:41,334
Ask yourselves:

1078
01:39:41,751 --> 01:39:44,254
Is this worth that?

1079
01:39:49,717 --> 01:39:52,186
Thank you. You first, Agnes!

1080
01:39:52,887 --> 01:39:55,481
Oh, no, no, no.
- Oh, yes! We've made a deal.

1081
01:39:55,807 --> 01:39:57,605
Off you go into the isolation booth!

1082
01:39:57,934 --> 01:40:01,313
Helmet on! I want you to imagine
 yourself in three situations.

1083
01:40:01,687 --> 01:40:05,237
One that makes you very happy,
one very sad and one very scared.

1084
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:07,493
Recent memories can be useful.

1085
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:11,831
Do not tell me the order,
I will guess it myself.

1086
01:40:14,117 --> 01:40:17,087
They said I'm mind-reader,
that's a bloody lie, I'm not.

1087
01:40:17,453 --> 01:40:21,128
I'm just a good diagnostician
with an awesome toy!

1088
01:40:25,253 --> 01:40:26,470
<i> Ready when you are.</i>

1089
01:40:42,437 --> 01:40:43,734
Out you come!

1090
01:40:48,109 --> 01:40:49,861
As I thought, you're an open book.

1091
01:40:50,236 --> 01:40:52,580
Sad, scared, happy.
In that order, final answer.

1092
01:40:53,906 --> 01:40:56,079
Yeah, you're good.

1093
01:40:56,451 --> 01:40:58,328
Your turn, Hector.

1094
01:40:59,287 --> 01:41:01,915
You know what, I think...
- Your turn, Hector! - Okay!

1095
01:41:04,459 --> 01:41:07,588
Head over yourself!
You're not an enemy of mine.

1096
01:41:09,255 --> 01:41:10,507
Sit my dear.

1097
01:41:12,675 --> 01:41:15,224
My way of identifying the emotions,

1098
01:41:15,636 --> 01:41:19,891
I assign a color to each corresponding 
part of the brain. It’s pretty obvious, really.

1099
01:41:20,266 --> 01:41:22,940
Sunny yellow happy.
Ice blue sad.

1100
01:41:23,436 --> 01:41:26,155
Battery acid green fear.

1101
01:41:26,522 --> 01:41:28,490
It corrodes you, you know.

1102
01:41:36,032 --> 01:41:38,455
<i>Right. Sad, scared, happy.</i>

1103
01:41:38,826 --> 01:41:40,828
<i> Don't tell me the order and be specific!</i>

1104
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:42,793
It's all about specificity.

1105
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:50,922
<i> I'm not gonna tell anybody. I promise you.</i>

1106
01:41:52,507 --> 01:41:53,258
<i> Shut up!</i>

1107
01:42:01,307 --> 01:42:02,524
That's odd.

1108
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:05,979
It's as if he's filtering,
 moderating his feelings.

1109
01:42:06,854 --> 01:42:10,358
Something's holding him back, 
some kind of barrier.

1110
01:42:21,452 --> 01:42:26,083
No, no, no! These are not the emotions of a grown man. 
 Tell me about it.

1111
01:42:26,499 --> 01:42:27,876
He's gonna have to dig a lot deeper.

1112
01:42:28,876 --> 01:42:30,503
There is no deeper.

1113
01:42:30,878 --> 01:42:33,006
<i> I must admit, I'm a little baffled.</i>

1114
01:42:34,507 --> 01:42:35,599
Hi, this is Hector.

1115
01:42:35,925 --> 01:42:40,647
<i> I think I can go deeper.
- Oh, fuck. We left the mic on.</i>

1116
01:42:41,806 --> 01:42:44,150
<i>I think I know where to go.</i>

1117
01:42:44,684 --> 01:42:47,528
Courage, Hector.
We are right there with you.

1118
01:43:57,548 --> 01:43:59,801
This is Hector, who the hell is this?

1119
01:44:05,139 --> 01:44:07,267
<i> I wanted to be a mother,</i>

1120
01:44:08,142 --> 01:44:09,189
<i> I haven't...</i>

1121
01:44:11,312 --> 01:44:13,064
<i> Just, not yours.</i>

1122
01:44:15,691 --> 01:44:18,865
Clara, listen, don't go anywhere.

1123
01:44:19,236 --> 01:44:21,785
Just stay there, okay. Hang on.

1124
01:44:22,156 --> 01:44:25,035
Professor, can we stop?
I need to take this call.

1125
01:44:25,409 --> 01:44:26,456
Please.

1126
01:44:26,827 --> 01:44:27,669
<i> Please.</i>

1127
01:44:28,704 --> 01:44:30,081
Clara, are you still there?

1128
01:44:31,832 --> 01:44:33,630
Yes, I'm here.

1129
01:44:33,959 --> 01:44:35,336
<i> Thank god.</i>

1130
01:44:36,754 --> 01:44:37,801
<i> Clara, listen.</i>

1131
01:44:45,513 --> 01:44:49,234
I'm sorry I didn't give you 
any explanation for this...

1132
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:55,573
insane journey, but the truth is,
 I didn't have any reasons of my own.

1133
01:44:55,940 --> 01:44:58,819
I didn't explain it to myself.

1134
01:45:00,903 --> 01:45:04,498
I've learned a lot, you know,
 I've learned a lot about happiness.

1135
01:45:05,199 --> 01:45:07,167
<i> and I've learned about unhappiness.</i>

1136
01:45:08,452 --> 01:45:11,331
And the thing that makes me most
 unhappy is the thought that

1137
01:45:11,664 --> 01:45:13,291
I might lose you.

1138
01:45:20,005 --> 01:45:21,882
And the thing that makes me 
happiest is the thought that

1139
01:45:22,174 --> 01:45:25,223
I could become the man that 
you spend the rest of your life with.

1140
01:45:39,650 --> 01:45:41,277
I miss my Hector.

1141
01:45:44,864 --> 01:45:46,616
I miss my Clara.

1142
01:45:56,041 --> 01:45:58,260
<i> Hector. Keep going!
You are knocking out of the park!</i>

1143
01:45:58,794 --> 01:45:59,841
Who is that?

1144
01:46:00,045 --> 01:46:03,766
It's sock drawer, but don't worry.
I'm locked inside a metal booth.

1145
01:46:04,091 --> 01:46:05,764
Good, skanky bitch!

1146
01:46:12,808 --> 01:46:17,484
Listen, I was way out of the line, you know,
saying that your job was meaningless.

1147
01:46:17,813 --> 01:46:21,158
Believe me, nobody does meaningless like I do.

1148
01:46:21,525 --> 01:46:25,530
That really was "The kettle calling the pot black" there, you know.

1149
01:46:26,197 --> 01:46:27,244
Wait.

1150
01:46:27,615 --> 01:46:30,084
<i> Is it the pot or the kettle that calls the other one black?</i>

1151
01:46:30,451 --> 01:46:32,920
And why black? What's that all about?

1152
01:46:33,537 --> 01:46:35,005
Yeah, I know.

1153
01:46:36,207 --> 01:46:38,050
Does it even matter?

1154
01:46:39,043 --> 01:46:42,638
We matter, Clara.
You and me, we matter.

1155
01:46:48,928 --> 01:46:50,350
Yeah.

1156
01:46:55,768 --> 01:46:58,442
Is this call as good as I think it is?

1157
01:47:01,273 --> 01:47:03,116
Yeah, I think it is.

1158
01:47:05,778 --> 01:47:07,576
Scary, but...

1159
01:47:08,447 --> 01:47:09,619
Yeah!

1160
01:48:03,002 --> 01:48:04,925
That's something else.

1161
01:48:05,254 --> 01:48:06,301
Which is it? Which one is it?

1162
01:48:09,758 --> 01:48:11,135
<i> It's all of them.</i>

1163
01:48:14,722 --> 01:48:16,315
It's all of them!

1164
01:48:22,938 --> 01:48:24,110
It's Aurora Borealis,

1165
01:48:24,481 --> 01:48:28,202
it's northern lights, it's all of them.
And there isn't enough to point.

1166
01:48:36,744 --> 01:48:38,746
<i> Okay, I love you.
- I love you too.</i>

1167
01:49:04,104 --> 01:49:05,151
Hector,

1168
01:49:05,522 --> 01:49:07,399
<i> you're a warrior!</i>

1169
01:49:15,866 --> 01:49:17,459
Would you take me to the airport, please?

1170
01:49:19,828 --> 01:49:21,125
Warrior.

1171
01:49:28,253 --> 01:49:29,675
Jesus,

1172
01:49:30,631 --> 01:49:32,304
I love you.
- I love you.

1173
01:49:32,716 --> 01:49:36,095
Bye, bye, bye.
- I'll ship your bags. Go!

1174
01:49:36,512 --> 01:49:37,764
Passport!

1175
01:49:57,157 --> 01:49:59,455
<i> How was your journey?
What did you learn?</i>

1176
01:50:01,829 --> 01:50:03,831
It was amazing, amazing.

1177
01:50:04,164 --> 01:50:08,544
I'm so ready to go home, 
to get back to my girl

1178
01:50:08,919 --> 01:50:11,092
my work.
I can't wait to tell my patients.

1179
01:50:11,755 --> 01:50:12,847
<i>Tell them what?</i>

1180
01:50:13,966 --> 01:50:18,142
That we all, all of us, have 
the capacity to be happy.

1181
01:50:19,805 --> 01:50:21,603
<i> Higher than that, Hector.</i>

1182
01:50:25,310 --> 01:50:29,110
That we all have the right to be happy?

1183
01:50:39,575 --> 01:50:40,792
I see.

1184
01:50:42,077 --> 01:50:44,296
We all have an obligation to be happy.

1185
01:50:59,261 --> 01:51:04,267
<i>Once upon a time,
 there was a young psychiatrist called Hector.</i>

1186
01:51:04,641 --> 01:51:06,769
<i>He was very satisfied with his life.</i>

1187
01:51:08,103 --> 01:51:10,902
Far be it from me, and forgive me for asking,
and I don't mean to pry,

1188
01:51:11,273 --> 01:51:13,651
but can this plane go any faster?

1189
01:51:27,414 --> 01:51:30,293
It's me, it's me, it's me!
- Hector!

1190
01:51:34,088 --> 01:51:36,182
<i> His world was complex,</i>

1191
01:51:36,590 --> 01:51:38,934
<i> sometimes even chaotic.</i>

1192
01:51:43,597 --> 01:51:44,894
<i> And he liked it that way.</i>

1193
01:51:48,227 --> 01:51:52,528
<i> He took comfort in the
 rich random patterns of his life.</i>

1194
01:51:54,691 --> 01:51:56,409
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Oh, man!

1195
01:51:56,777 --> 01:52:00,407
<i> He listened to his patients 
with real patience.</i>

1196
01:52:03,283 --> 01:52:04,876
<i> If you see what I mean.</i>

1197
01:52:05,994 --> 01:52:08,747
<i> Sometimes with surprising results.</i>

1198
01:52:09,123 --> 01:52:11,421
It looks, it looks acceptable.

1199
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:19,137
Now then, Anjali, 
beware the ego's need of shaping hallucinations.

1200
01:52:20,217 --> 01:52:24,563
Looks like someone's 
ego shaped a beautiful naked Chinese girl.

1201
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:29,727
What?

1202
01:52:30,644 --> 01:52:33,944
I won't pretend that...
- That's tight, no more pretending.

1203
01:52:34,982 --> 01:52:35,904
Right.

1204
01:52:46,618 --> 01:52:47,995
Gotcha!

1205
01:52:50,205 --> 01:52:51,457
Okay, you'll pay for that!

1206
01:52:53,083 --> 01:52:54,426
The other way. Go to the rear.

1207
01:52:56,336 --> 01:52:57,508
My girlfriend is coming.

1208
01:52:58,338 --> 01:53:00,682
<i> Everything was up for change.</i>

1209
01:53:03,260 --> 01:53:05,513
<i> Including Hector.</i>

1210
01:53:24,239 --> 01:53:27,118
<i> And he learnt to love,</i>

1211
01:53:27,910 --> 01:53:31,164
<i> like he'd never loved before!</i>
