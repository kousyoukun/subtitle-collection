around here?

334
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:03,939
Christian, how do you
have my bank information?

335
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,110
Thank you.

339
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:20,890
My parents are hosting
a charity ball tonight.

340
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,049
I promised I'd make
an appearance.

341
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:25,188
Want you to come with me.

342
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:29,129
I've never been to a ball.

343
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,890
I don't have a dress for that.

344
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,362
Also, what am I gonna
do with my hair?

345
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:35,869
I know a salon.

346
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,432
And you don't need to
worry about a dress.

347
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,099
It's all gonna be taken care of.

348
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:44,472
What is it'?
Um...

349
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,112
There was just a girl
over there.

350
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:49,152
And she was outside
my office yesterday.

351
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:51,950
And she knew my name.

352
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:55,456
And she had a bandage on her wrist.
It was really strange.

353
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,896
We should go.

354
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,500
Just now.

355
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,096
Yeah.

356
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,067
Keep me informed.

357
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,805
You know that girl, Christian?

358
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,005
I'm handling it.
What does that mean?

359
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,181

Was that Mrs. Robinson?

369
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:27,708
Her name's Elena Lincoln.

370
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:29,606
I don't care what her
name is, Christian.

371
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,314
Why would you take me there?

372
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:34,915
Why would you take me to meet the
woman who seduced and abused you?

373
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:38,222
Our relationship ended years ago.
We're just friends.

374
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,521
And business partners.

375
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:41,865
Business partners?
Are you kidding me?

376
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:45,365
Would you take your Subs there?

377
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,562
Oh, my God! For what?
Her approval?

378
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:51,732
What?
What is this?

379
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,901
No. It's not like that

380
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,740
That girl that I saw this morning
was one of them, wasn't she?

381
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,080
Let's discuss this
back at my place.

382
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:00,771
I can have someone
come by, do your hair.

383
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,317
Christian, I don't care
about my hair!

384
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:03,877
Explain to me what's going on.

385
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:06,352
I'll explain when
we're there. Come on.

386
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:09,856
Okay, you can either walk or I
can carry you. Your choice.

387
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:12,222
(CHUCKLES) You wouldn't do that.
No, it's your choice.

388
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:16,526
Okay, fine. Fine.
I'll walk.

389
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:23,198
CHRISTIAN: Her name's
Leila Williams.

390
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,905
She was my Sub for a while
about two years ago.

391
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,538
What happened to her?

392
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,744
She wanted more.
I didn't.

393
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,773
So I ended it.

394
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:37,615
She left. Got married.

395
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,780
I thought she moved on, but then
her husband died in a car crash.

396
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,619
She had a breakdown.

397
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,563
What does she want now?

398
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,632
When you and I were in Georgia
together, she turned up here

399
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:54,761
and tried to slit her wrists in front
of Mrs. Jones, my housekeeper.

400
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:56,732
Oh, my God.

401
00:29:56,895 --> 00:30:00,001
Gail took her to the hospital,
but by the time I got there,

402
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:01,406
she'd taken off.

403
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:04,240
My people have been
trying to find her.

404
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,113
Your people?

405
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:10,250
Is that who put this together?

406
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:15,915
Is there one on me?

407
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,492
Let me see it.

my bathroom breaks.

get your money back.

414

I had no idea what
this was gonna become.

415
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:11,915
I didn't know
you'd be different.

416
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,314
Different? Really?

417
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:18,711
Is that why you brought me
to Mrs. Robinson's,

418
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,154
where you brought all the other women?
Because I'm so different?

419
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,323
That was wrong. I admit.

420
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:28,488
It's all wrong.
All of this is wrong.

421
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:34,668
You put money into my account that...
I don't want it.

422
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:38,064
You bought the company
I work for.

423
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,041
This isn't a relationship,
Christian. It's ownership.

424
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,210
I'm trying to understand you.

425
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:51,847
I am just wanting to
get close to you.

426

do that when you keep doing

bizarre things like this.

428
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:00,736
And it's really difficult to do that
when you won't let me touch you.

429

Come to my bedroom.
