Listen!

3
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:27,728
Stop!

4
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:29,506
You silly fucking twit!

5
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,531
Please!

6
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:34,477
You are one stupid
fucking bitch, you know that?

7
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:36,647
Shut the fuck up!

8
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:38,410
No.

9
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,188
There you are.

10
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:47,153
No!

11
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:49,749
No.

12
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,762
You're a little shit.
No!

13
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:53,186
No!

16
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,809
Anastasia Steele?

17
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,984
Thanks.

18
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,844
Yeah. Got it.
Thank you.

19
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,510
Good morning, Mr. Hyde.

20
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,781
Ana, please, it's Jack.

21
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,223
Tea, right? Weak, black.

22
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:02,225
I'm pretty sure I'm
supposed to get this for you,

23
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,362
but thank you, Jack.

24
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,212
<i>Barbados is amazing;.</i>

25
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:25,544
<i>It's all coral
and turtles and booze...</i>

26
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,745
<i>Oh! You should be here.
Why aren't you here?</i>

27
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,620
<i>Yeah, and tell that
douchebag brother at mine</i>

28
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,646
to take a day off for once, <i>would</i> ya?

29
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,384
<i>All right. Bye, Ana.
Bye!</i>

30
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,194
<i>So, how's the new job'?</i>

31
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:18,801
It's good. My boss has me
weighing in on submissions.

32
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,706
<i>That's exciting. Great.</i>

33
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,070
Have you heard from Christian?

34
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,611
Yeah.

35
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,274
He sent me flowers.

36
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,143
To wish me luck.

37
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,718
<i>Sweetheart,</i>

38
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,618
are you ever gonna tell me
what happened between you?

39
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,887
Fundamental
differences, I guess.

40
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,918
It wasn't gonna last.

41
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:53,400
Are those for me?

42
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:55,606
Nah. They can wait.

43
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:56,832
Okay.

44
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,307
Look nice.
Going out tonight?

45
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:03,340
Oh, um, a friend of mine has a
photography exhibition opening tonight.

46
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:04,938
So, gonna go.

47
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,306
Good.

48
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,018
How did you make out
with those manuscripts?

49
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,346
Oh, really great, actually.
This one, um...

50
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,283
Boyce Fox.

51
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,485
I couldn't put it down.
It's so sharp.

52
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,121
And relevant. And I think
he's really got something.

53
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:22,289
You think?
Yeah.

54
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:26,131
All right. I'll check it out.
Great.

55
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,963
Have fun tonight, Ana.
Thank you.

56
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:29,300
Thanks for today.

57
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:32,299
Good night, Hannah.

58
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,271
Bye!

59
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,992
Glass of chardonnay?

60
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:52,554
Thanks.
Mmm-hmm.

61
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,878
Oh, my God.

62
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,013
Jesus Christ.

63
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:22,182
Ana!

64
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,693
You made it.

65
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,186
José...

66
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:30,224
This is, like, so much
of my face in here.

67
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,837
Well, if I had asked, you would
have been like, "I'm too shy."

68
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:34,994
Yeah.

69
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,837
But you...

70
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,336
It's my best stuff.

71
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,876
That's so.“

72
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,044
Do you like them?

73
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,848
They are super large.

74
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:50,542
Hold on.

75
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,888
All the portraits
have sold to one man.

76
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,084
You're kidding!
No.

77
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:02,928
Well, somebody likes them.

78
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,529
They just bought all six.

79
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,594
All six?

80
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,570
Dinner's on me tonight, okay?

81
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,531
I'll be right back.

82
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,602
Anastasia.

83
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,446
It was you, wasn't it? You just
went and bought all of these?

84
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,443
I don't like strangers
gawking at you.

85
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,484
Why are you here?

86
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,121
For you.

87
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,425
Hey.

88
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,794
Can we talk somewhere private?

89
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:10,957
No.

90
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,462
Look, I'm not very good at this.
I've never had to...

91
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,130
I've never wanted to try again.

92
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,709
Christian, I don't...

93
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,643
It's not a good idea.
Let's talk.

94
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,806
Okay? Just talk, please.

95
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,641
Have dinner with me.

96
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,187
Okay, fine. I will have
dinner with you.

97
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:39,993
Because I'm hungry.

98
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:43,327
But we are only talking
and that is it.

99
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,200
Hold on.

100
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,743
Hey.
I'm gonna take off.

101
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,648
Already? Your photos
are so stunning, José.

102
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,245
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm proud of you.

103
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:39,248
Christian, I can't.
I can't do this.

104
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,617
Christ, Ana.

105
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,756
Okay.

106
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,458
I have a proposition.

107
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,035
Just come to dinner.
We can talk.

108
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,374
Would you like some more time?

109
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:02,244
No. Two steaks' medium.
Fries. Green vegetables.

110
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:06,043
Um, actually, I'm gonna have
the quinoa salad.

111
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,612
Fine.

112
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,948
And two glasses of
the Barossa Valley Shiraz.

113
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,057
We only sell that
by the bottle, sir.

114
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,114
A bottle then.

115
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,619
Yes, Sir.

116
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,951
Thanks.

117
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,086
So?

118
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,097
Let's talk.

119
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,062
I want you back.

120
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,970
I'd like to renegotiate terms.

121
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,410
But I don't see how.

122
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,809
The things you want, you
said that's the way you are.

123
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:45,082
But what happened last time,
that's not gonna happen again.

124
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,321
How can you say that?

125
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:54,656
I know that I asked you
to show me how far it can go,

126
00:10:57,624 --> 00:11:00,798
but you were getting off
on the pain you inflicted.

127
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:05,837
That's still in you.

128
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,509
I'm working on it.

129
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,443
Working on what?

130
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,184
I can't do this
if you won't talk to me.

131
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,513
What do you wanna know?

132
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,317
Everything.

133
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,520
Fine.

134
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:39,868
Yeah. We'll manage.

135
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,051
My birth mother died
when I was four.

136
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,523
She was an addict. Crack.

137
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,161
You can fill in the blanks.

138
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:00,863
Why didn't you tell me that?

139
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:01,888
I did.

140
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:05,565
But you were asleep at the time.

141
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:09,564
Okay. Well, um...

142
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:11,535
Generally,

143
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,838
a key part of good communication

144
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:18,405
is that both parties
be conscious.

145
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,914
I'm really sorry
about your mother.

146
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,414
It's in the past.

147
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:32,428
Now, I brought you here
to negotiate.

148
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,123
You're open to new terms?

149
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,067
No rules.

150
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,598
No punishments.

151
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,076
No rules, no punishments

152
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,104
and no more secrets.

153
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,410
I can do that.

154
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:55,814
You want a...

155
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,613
What do you call it?

156
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,954
A vanilla relationship?

157
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,151
I mean, we only do what
you're comfortable with.

158
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,125
But you need all those things.

159
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,434
I need you more.

160
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,632
Miss Steele.

161
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,005
Thanks, Taylor.

162
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:27,975
No strings attached.

163
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,142
This is spiky.

164
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,209
I like it.

165
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,176
I'll call you tomorrow.

166
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,511
Okay.

167
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,685
Good night.

168
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:27,193
Ana, I've been hearing a lot
of good things about you.

169
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,872
- Oh...
- Told you, Liz.

170
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,574
This one actually reads.

171
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,731
Hey, Jack.

172
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:34,338
What's the head of HR doing lurking around?
Are we in trouble?

173
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:38,047
Not at all.
I'm just here to encourage.

174
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:42,543
Really? Well, I think a round of
drinks at Lori's would do the trick.

175
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,721
Sorry. Meetings.
Otherwise.

176
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,323
Who's Lori?

177
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,426
Oh, it's a bar
around the corner.

178
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,922
Fridays are a bit of a ritual.

179
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,260
You should come.

180
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,758
Absolutely. Go network.

181
00:15:56,923 --> 00:16:00,735
Oh, no, I would. I have plans tonight.

182
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,837
So have your plan come along.
Just for a quick one.

183
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:06,937
Hello?

184
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,100
Yeah.

185
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:12,180
Have fun.

186
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,759
Anastasia.

187
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,930
I'm sorry.
Have we met before?

188
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,455
It's okay.

189
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,260
I'm nobody.

190
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:33,269
Hey. Lori's is this way.

191
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,531
Come on, I'm buying.

192
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,805
All right. Here we go.

193
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:43,606
Mmm. Thanks.

194
