Uh, uh, Christian has a lot of ties.

Your bag? Where are you going?

1816

Um, yeah, birthday.

Well, I feel like celebrating it.

Can't open it till the day though.

1829
01:40:02,515 --> 01:40:05,067
Then why give it to me now?

1830
01:40:06,485 --> 01:40:09,454
Call it delayed gratification.

Is that Mount St. Helens?

Relax, Ros.

01:55:33,945 --> 01:55:36,580
You've always known your own mind.

2116
01:55:36,581 --> 01:55:38,782
If that man is the love of your life,...

2117
01:55:38,783 --> 01:55:41,652
...you grab him with both hands.

2118
01:55:41,653 --> 01:55:44,255
Thanks, Mama.

2119
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:45,583
Have you called Ray?

2120
01:55:45,590 --> 01:55:47,791
Um, no, not yet.

2121
01:55:47,792 --> 01:55:49,926
Um, Christian did, though.

2122
01:55:49,927 --> 01:55:52,263
He asked for his permission.

2123
01:55:52,264 --> 01:55:54,431
[gasps]
He asked for your hand?

2124
01:55:54,432 --> 01:55:56,700
That's so chivalrous.

2125
01:55:56,701 --> 01:55:58,845
[chuckles]

2126
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:10,454
[gentle piano music playing]

2127
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:17,588
[laughter]

2128
01:56:17,589 --> 01:56:20,457
- I don't think she's gotten one of these.
- Cheers.

2129
01:56:20,458 --> 01:56:21,751
[Anastasia chuckles]

2130
01:56:21,759 --> 01:56:22,713
Hey.

2131
01:56:23,761 --> 01:56:24,782
Hey.

2132
01:56:24,796 --> 01:56:26,395
Champagne, Mr. Grey?

2133
01:56:26,398 --> 01:56:27,555
Thanks, Gretchen.

2134
01:56:27,565 --> 01:56:30,834
And can I just say happy birthday?

2135
01:56:30,835 --> 01:56:32,945
Sure. Thank you.

2136
01:56:35,873 --> 01:56:38,074
- Christian.
- Mom.

2137
01:56:38,075 --> 01:56:40,377
- Oh. Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

2138
01:56:40,378 --> 01:56:42,713
- Mmm. And Ana.
- Hi.

2139
01:56:42,714 --> 01:56:44,815
It's so good to see you again.

2140
01:56:44,816 --> 01:56:47,384
You saw us last night.

2141
01:56:47,385 --> 01:56:49,620
Yes. And because of that,...

2142
01:56:49,621 --> 01:56:53,757
...I am never taking anything
for granted, ever again.

2143
01:56:53,758 --> 01:56:55,358
(ELENA) Hey.

2144
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:57,328
I heard about the crash.
Are you okay?

2145
01:56:57,329 --> 01:56:59,563
- I'm fine, Elena. Thank you.
- Oh!

2146
01:56:59,564 --> 01:57:00,789
[grunts softly]

2147
01:57:00,798 --> 01:57:04,401
Ana, let me introduce to you
my good friend Elena Lincoln.

2148
01:57:04,402 --> 01:57:06,570
Uh, we met at the masquerade.

2149
01:57:06,571 --> 01:57:07,558
Yes.

2150
01:57:07,572 --> 01:57:08,797
Nice to see you again.

2151
01:57:11,008 --> 01:57:12,438
(CHRISTIAN) Excuse us.

2152
01:57:12,444 --> 01:57:14,009
Surely.

2153
01:57:14,011 --> 01:57:15,407
She's fantastic.

2154
01:57:18,616 --> 01:57:20,851
[Christian clears throat]

2155
01:57:20,852 --> 01:57:22,853
[chatter quiets]

2156
01:57:22,854 --> 01:57:25,522
Ladies, gentlemen, Mia.

2157
01:57:25,523 --> 01:57:27,791
[laughter]

2158
01:57:27,792 --> 01:57:30,761
I want to thank you all
for coming here this evening.

2159
01:57:30,762 --> 01:57:32,529
I was expecting
a small family gathering.

2160
01:57:32,530 --> 01:57:33,994
- Thanks, Mia.
- [laughter]

2161
01:57:33,998 --> 01:57:35,832
Uh, but I'm happy
that you're all here,...

2162
01:57:35,833 --> 01:57:38,969
...because I have
an announcement to make.

2163
01:57:38,970 --> 01:57:43,054
As most of you know, yesterday
Ros and I had a narrow escape.

2164
01:57:44,942 --> 01:57:48,745
And something like that reminds
us of what really matters...

2165
01:57:48,746 --> 01:57:52,015
...and how important it is
to seize the day.

2166
01:57:52,016 --> 01:57:53,784
We should cherish
the people we care about...

2167
01:57:53,785 --> 01:57:56,387
...and-- and who care about us.

2168
01:57:56,388 --> 01:57:58,755
Mom, Dad,...

2169
01:57:58,756 --> 01:58:03,427
...I know I haven't always
been the perfect son,...

2170
01:58:03,428 --> 01:58:07,097
...but I owe everything
to you both, so thank you.

2171
01:58:07,098 --> 01:58:09,566
[applause]

2172
01:58:09,567 --> 01:58:11,735
(MAN) Hear, hear.

2173
01:58:11,736 --> 01:58:13,804
Oh, here.

2174
01:58:13,805 --> 01:58:15,839
But that's not the announcement.

2175
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:18,903
Ana, come up here a second, please.

2176
01:58:21,579 --> 01:58:22,974
[chuckles nervously]

2177
01:58:29,053 --> 01:58:31,054
So a while ago, I was lucky enough...

2178
01:58:31,055 --> 01:58:34,825
...to meet this amazing
young woman, Anastasia Steele.

2179
01:58:34,826 --> 01:58:37,193
And very quickly, I realized
that she was the one...

2180
01:58:37,194 --> 01:58:39,930
...I wanted to share my life with.

2181
01:58:39,931 --> 01:58:42,533
So I asked her to marry me.

2182
01:58:42,534 --> 01:58:43,963
And she said yes.

2183
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:47,170
- [crowd exclaiming, applauding]
- Oh, that is so--

2184
01:58:47,171 --> 01:58:48,839
[laughter]

2185
01:58:58,015 --> 01:59:00,984
- I'm thrilled, Ana.
- Come here, bro.

2186
01:59:00,985 --> 01:59:02,853
- Welcome to the family.
- (ANASTASIA) Thank you.

2187
01:59:02,854 --> 01:59:06,490
(GRACE) And if I cry any more,
I'm just going to dehydrate.

2188
01:59:06,491 --> 01:59:07,920
- Welcome.
- Oh, my God, don't do that.

2189
01:59:07,925 --> 01:59:09,014
Congratulations.

2190
01:59:09,026 --> 01:59:10,524
Stop crying, Mom.

2191
01:59:10,528 --> 01:59:11,719
- Can't help it.
- [chuckles]

2192
01:59:11,729 --> 01:59:13,864
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

2193
01:59:13,865 --> 01:59:17,534
[chuckles] Well done, big brother.

2194
01:59:17,535 --> 01:59:20,103
Ring. Show me the ring.

2195
01:59:20,104 --> 01:59:21,905
Oh, we're gonna choose it together.

2196
01:59:21,906 --> 01:59:23,199
No rock.

2197
01:59:23,207 --> 01:59:24,975
Christian Grey.

2198
01:59:24,976 --> 01:59:26,977
Oh, my God, I have a sister!

2199
01:59:26,978 --> 01:59:29,012
- [both laugh]
- Ana!

2200
01:59:29,013 --> 01:59:30,947
(CARRICK) Thanks, Jim.

2201
01:59:30,948 --> 01:59:32,923
Grace and I are so proud.

2202
01:59:38,055 --> 01:59:39,890
[chuckles]

2203
01:59:39,891 --> 01:59:42,593
I leave you alone for a couple
weeks and this is what happens?

2204
01:59:42,594 --> 01:59:43,853
- I know. I'm--
- [chuckles]

2205
01:59:43,861 --> 01:59:45,862
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
- Oh, please.

2206
01:59:45,863 --> 01:59:47,225
- Come here.
- Oh.

2207
01:59:47,231 --> 01:59:49,666
- Mm.
- [both chuckle]

2208
01:59:49,667 --> 01:59:52,002
So, how does it feel to bag...

2209
01:59:52,003 --> 01:59:53,535
...Seattle's most eligible bachelor?

2210
01:59:53,538 --> 01:59:55,506
It's a little scary, but--

2211
01:59:55,507 --> 01:59:58,041
Well, if anyone can make
it work, it's you.

2212
01:59:58,042 --> 02:00:00,677
Hey, sis-in-law.

2213
02:00:00,678 --> 02:00:02,005
Congratulations.

2214
02:00:02,013 --> 02:00:03,847
Christian's a very lucky guy.

2215
02:00:03,848 --> 02:00:04,699
[women chuckle]

2216
02:00:04,716 --> 02:00:07,283
You, however, are certifiably insane.

2217
02:00:07,284 --> 02:00:09,219
- [women laugh]
- Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt.

2218
02:00:09,220 --> 02:00:11,522
Uh, Mia wants to taste
one of your killer cocktails.

2219
02:00:11,523 --> 02:00:12,713
Oh, well, coming right up.

2220
02:00:12,724 --> 02:00:13,881
[giggles]

2221
02:00:15,092 --> 02:00:18,564
I see you heeded our little talk.

2222
02:00:21,599 --> 02:00:23,063
[sighs]

2223
02:00:23,067 --> 02:00:25,802
What makes you think
I would ever listen to you?

2224
02:00:25,803 --> 02:00:27,871
You don't care about Christian.

2225
02:00:27,872 --> 02:00:29,233
He'll see that.

2226
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:30,806
I'll make sure of it.

2227
02:00:30,808 --> 02:00:33,844
He'll see right through you.

2228
02:00:33,845 --> 02:00:35,879
It's over for you, Elena.

2229
02:00:35,880 --> 02:00:39,115
You're just a mousy
little thing after his money.

2230
02:00:39,116 --> 02:00:41,635
He's not capable of marriage.

2231
02:00:42,153 --> 02:00:43,583

Thank you, Christian.

(CHRISTIAN)
Why are you even here, Elena?

2235
02:00:53,097 --> 02:00:54,697
She's not right for you.

2236
02:00:54,699 --> 02:00:56,667
You don't know what's right for me.

2237
02:00:56,668 --> 02:00:58,802
You taught me how to fuck, Elena.

2238
02:00:58,803 --> 02:01:00,571
Ana taught me how to love.

2239
02:01:00,572 --> 02:01:03,139
She's just the next one in line.

2240
02:01:03,140 --> 02:01:05,013
Get out of my house.

[exhales]

2242
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:10,947
Leave my children alone...

2243
02:01:10,948 --> 02:01:13,160
...and get the hell out of my house.

2244
02:01:26,130 --> 02:01:28,999
Ana, darling...

2245
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:32,641
...would you give us
a moment alone, please?

2246
02:01:36,774 --> 02:01:39,633

02:02:01,999 --> 02:02:03,190
I'm sorry about that.

[exhales]

2251
02:02:07,271 --> 02:02:08,769
Is your mom okay?

2252
02:02:10,007 --> 02:02:12,643
- Furious.
- Hmm.

2253
02:02:12,644 --> 02:02:14,140
Elena's gone.

2254
02:02:14,145 --> 02:02:16,346
Like gone, gone?

2255
02:02:16,347 --> 02:02:17,742
I'm done.

2256
02:02:17,749 --> 02:02:20,216
The business, everything.

2257
02:02:20,217 --> 02:02:22,805
I'll have my people sort out
the details tomorrow.

2258
02:02:24,856 --> 02:02:27,290
I know she was important to you.

2259
02:02:27,291 --> 02:02:29,993
I'm sorry.

2260
02:02:29,994 --> 02:02:32,162
Are you?

2261
02:02:32,163 --> 02:02:33,422
- No.
- No.

[both chuckle]

2263
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:38,276
What's that you got there?

2264
02:02:45,042 --> 02:02:46,676
[sighs softly]

2265
02:02:53,084 --> 02:02:54,445
Come with me.

2266
02:02:54,451 --> 02:02:59,022
There's something I need to show you.

2267
02:02:59,023 --> 02:03:00,691
(ANASTASIA) Last time
we came down here,...

2268
02:03:00,692 --> 02:03:01,951
...I was over your shoulder.

2269
02:03:01,959 --> 02:03:03,934
- [chuckles]
- Oh, yeah.

2270

[Anastasia sighs]

2274
02:03:21,278 --> 02:03:23,253
After you.

2275
02:03:34,191 --> 02:03:35,860
(ANASTASIA) Oh, my God!

2276
