00:09:39,063 --> 00:09:41,131
I can't do this.

169
00:09:41,132 --> 00:09:42,221
Christ, Ana.

170
00:09:45,636 --> 00:09:47,508
Okay.

171
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:50,613
I have a proposition.
Just...

172
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:54,467
...come to dinner, we can talk.

173
00:09:58,516 --> 00:09:59,502
Would you like some more time?

174
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:02,119
No. Two steaks... medium fries,...

175
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,514
...green vegetables.

176
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:08,658
Um, actually, I'm gonna have
the quinoa salad.

177
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:12,062
Fine. And two glasses
of the Barossa Valley Shiraz.

178
00:10:12,063 --> 00:10:14,097
We only sell that by the bottle, sir.

179
00:10:14,098 --> 00:10:15,425
A bottle, then.

180
00:10:15,433 --> 00:10:17,101
Yes, sir.

181
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:20,137
Thanks.

182
00:10:20,138 --> 00:10:21,363
So...

183
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:23,040
...let's talk.

184
00:10:27,611 --> 00:10:30,301
I want you back.

185
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,052
I'd like to renegotiate terms.

186
00:10:35,053 --> 00:10:39,022
But I don't see how.

187
00:10:39,023 --> 00:10:43,193
The things you want, you said
that's the way you are.

188
00:10:43,194 --> 00:10:46,363
But what happened last time,
it's not gonna happen again.

189
00:10:46,364 --> 00:10:48,440
How can you say that?

190
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:53,236
I know that I asked you to...

191
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:56,572
...show me how far it can go, but...

192
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:02,012
...you were getting off
on the pain you inflicted.

193
00:11:05,316 --> 00:11:07,184
That's still in you.

194
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:09,752
I'm working on it.

195
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:12,545
Working on what?

196
00:11:13,992 --> 00:11:18,095
I can't do this if you won't talk to me.

197
00:11:18,096 --> 00:11:21,031
What do you want to know?

198
00:11:21,032 --> 00:11:22,495
Everything.

199
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:26,222
Fine.

200
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:41,155
Yeah. We'll manage.

201
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,364
My birth mother died when I was four.

202
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:57,167
She was an addict. Crack.

203
00:11:57,168 --> 00:11:59,436
You can fill in the blanks.

204
00:11:59,437 --> 00:12:02,105
Why didn't you tell me that?

205
00:12:02,106 --> 00:12:03,297
I did.

206
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:06,744
But you were asleep at the time.

207
00:12:08,146 --> 00:12:11,081
Okay. Well, um...

208
00:12:11,082 --> 00:12:12,749
...generally...

209
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,818
...a key part of good communication...

210
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,611
...is that both parties be conscious.

211
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:23,368
I'm really sorry about your mother.

212
00:12:27,065 --> 00:12:29,599
It's in the past.

213
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,334
Now--

214
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:33,670
I brought you here to negotiate.

215
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:36,473
You're open to new terms?

216
00:12:38,742 --> 00:12:41,111
No rules.

217
00:12:41,112 --> 00:12:42,779
No punishments.

218
00:12:47,718 --> 00:12:50,353
No rules, no punishments, and...

219
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:52,362
...no more secrets.

220
00:12:53,424 --> 00:12:55,658
I can do that.

221
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:58,795
You want a--
What do you call it--?

222
00:12:58,796 --> 00:13:01,298
A vanilla relationship?

223
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:04,501
I mean we only do
what you're comfortable with.

224
00:13:04,502 --> 00:13:07,395
But you need all those things.

225
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,603
I need you more.

226
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:20,783
Miss Steele.

227
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:22,657
Thanks, Taylor.

228
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:29,466
No strings attached.

229
00:13:55,553 --> 00:13:57,454
This is spiky.

230
00:13:57,455 --> 00:13:59,322
I like it.

231
00:14:02,626 --> 00:14:05,695
I'll call you tomorrow.

232
00:14:05,696 --> 00:14:07,397
Okay.

233
00:14:07,398 --> 00:14:09,406
Good night.

234
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,770
Hmm.

235
00:15:24,242 --> 00:15:25,942
Ana.

236
00:15:25,943 --> 00:15:28,545
I've been hearing a lot of
good things about you.

237
00:15:28,546 --> 00:15:30,347
- Oh--
- <i>Told you, Liz.</i>

238
00:15:30,348 --> 00:15:31,946
This one actually reads.

239
00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:33,950
- Hey, Jack.
- What's the head of HR doing...

240
00:15:33,951 --> 00:15:35,550
...lurking around?
Are we in trouble?

241
00:15:35,553 --> 00:15:37,387
Not at all.

242
00:15:37,388 --> 00:15:39,422
I'm just here to encourage.

243
00:15:39,423 --> 00:15:41,391
<i>Really? Well, I think...</i>

244
00:15:41,392 --> 00:15:43,793
...a round of drinks at Lori's
would do the trick.

245
00:15:43,794 --> 00:15:45,695
Sorry. Meetings.

246
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:46,955
Otherwise.

247
00:15:46,964 --> 00:15:48,698
Who's Lori?

248
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,733
Oh, it's a bar around the corner.

249
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:53,336
- Oh.
- Fridays are a bit of a ritual.

250
00:15:53,337 --> 00:15:55,572
You should come.

251
00:15:55,573 --> 00:15:58,308
Absolutely. Go network.

252
00:15:58,309 --> 00:15:59,636
Oh, no, I... I would.

253
00:15:59,643 --> 00:16:01,944
I... have plans tonight.

254
00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:04,481
So, have your plan come along.

255
00:16:04,482 --> 00:16:06,383
Just for a quick one.

256
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:08,485
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, Jack.</i>

257
00:16:08,486 --> 00:16:10,051
Yeah. Yeah,...

258
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,888
...no, my, uh, my--

259
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:14,591
Have fun.

260
00:16:14,592 --> 00:16:16,593
<i>Doing light duty, I swear.</i>

261
00:16:16,594 --> 00:16:19,453
Yeah. Two more chapters
like that and we're good.

262
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:24,634
Anastasia.

263
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:27,051
I'm sorry, have we met before?

264
00:16:28,306 --> 00:16:29,769
It's okay.

265
00:16:29,773 --> 00:16:31,608
I'm nobody.

266
00:16:31,609 --> 00:16:34,544
Hey. Lori's is this way.

267
00:16:34,545 --> 00:16:36,757
Come on. I'm buying.

268
00:16:40,518 --> 00:16:43,386
All right, here we go.

269
00:16:43,387 --> 00:16:44,884
Thanks.

270
00:16:44,888 --> 00:16:48,625
- Where is everyone?
- You know, it's still early.

271
00:16:48,626 --> 00:16:51,728
Your comments on Boyce Fox
were interesting.

272
00:16:51,729 --> 00:16:54,431
I'm not usually
into political thrillers.

273
00:16:54,432 --> 00:16:56,633
Yeah, well, I think the parallels...

274
00:16:56,634 --> 00:16:58,635
...with Dante's Inferno are amazing,...

275
00:16:58,636 --> 00:17:00,637
- ...but--
- No, no, no. You convinced me.

276
00:17:00,638 --> 00:17:02,339
I'm reading.

277
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,574
<i>Oh. That's great.</i>

278
00:17:04,575 --> 00:17:06,004
Hey.

279
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:08,978
Hi. Um, uh, Christian,...

280
00:17:08,979 --> 00:17:10,813
...this is Jack Hyde.

281
00:17:10,814 --> 00:17:12,789
I'm the boyfriend.

282
00:17:13,851 --> 00:17:15,585
I'm the boss.

283
00:17:15,586 --> 00:17:17,390
What'll you have, Chris?

284
00:17:18,456 --> 00:17:19,885
Thanks, Jack.

285
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,691
Another time.

286
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:23,426
Mm.

287
00:17:23,427 --> 00:17:24,618
Thanks.

288
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,365
Another time.

289
00:17:31,369 --> 00:17:32,865
I can't believe...

290
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,804
...you just talked to him like that.

291
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:36,639
He wants what's mine.

292
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,475
What's yours?

293
00:17:38,476 --> 00:17:40,710
That's a little presumptuous.

294
00:17:40,711 --> 00:17:44,814
He's my boss, Christian.
You've got to calm down.

295
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:47,129
Calm isn't really my forte.

296
00:17:48,886 --> 00:17:51,881
I know something that could help.

297
00:17:56,026 --> 00:17:58,561
You know, this is not
what I had in mind.

298
00:17:58,562 --> 00:18:02,765
When's the last time you went shopping?

299
00:18:02,766 --> 00:18:05,167
Houston. A week ago.

300
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:06,869
What'd you buy?

301
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,743
An airline.

302
00:18:11,742 --> 00:18:13,375
Here.

303
00:18:16,714 --> 00:18:19,416

I'll manage.

313
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:47,711
Okay.

314
00:18:50,914 --> 00:18:52,849
I know what you're doing.

315
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,618
What? I'm being a culinary mastermind.

316
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:57,820

Okay.

321
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:09,041
- Okay.
- Okay.

322
00:19:12,002 --> 00:19:14,236
Tell me about SIP.

323
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:16,973
How's it going?

324
00:19:16,974 --> 00:19:18,841
It's good.

325
00:19:18,842 --> 00:19:20,210
Jack seems...

326
00:19:20,211 --> 00:19:22,679
...genuinely interested in my opinion.

327
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,481
What's morale like?

328
00:19:24,482 --> 00:19:26,849
Morale? You mean, like,
do we all sit in a circle...

329
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,951
...and sing the company song
in the morning?

330
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:32,152
Yeah, is the firm well managed?
Are people happy?

331
00:19:33,557 --> 00:19:35,958
- Oh, my God.
- What?

332
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:38,995
You're buying SIP?

333
00:19:38,996 --> 00:19:41,664
No, you can't do that.
That's my job.

334
00:19:41,665 --> 00:19:43,633
You can't start interfering
in my career.

335
00:19:43,634 --> 00:19:45,199
It's not about that.

336
00:19:45,202 --> 00:19:47,604
I've wanted to move into publishing.

337

They're the best fit.

338
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:52,041
But you're gonna be my boss.

339
00:19:52,042 --> 00:19:55,612
Technically, I'll be your
boss's boss's boss.

340
00:19:55,613 --> 00:19:57,847
And I'm gonna be sleeping
with my boss's boss's boss.

341
00:19:57,848 --> 00:19:59,916
Well, right now you're arguing with him.

342
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:01,918
Yeah, because he's being an ass.

343
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,853
An ass. Really?

344
00:20:03,854 --> 00:20:05,828
Ass.

For sex.

385
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:33,863
Um--

386
00:23:33,864 --> 00:23:37,266
Well--

387
00:23:37,267 --> 00:23:41,437
I was reading Austen and... Brontë,...

388
00:23:41,438 --> 00:23:44,399
...and nobody ever measured up to that.

389
00:23:46,076 --> 00:23:50,024
I guess I was waiting
for something exceptional.

390
00:23:51,214 --> 00:23:53,732
And then I met you.

391
00:23:57,387 --> 00:24:01,190
Would Miss Austen...

392
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:04,927
...approve of this?

393
00:24:04,928 --> 00:24:08,130
I was being romantic, and then
you just go and distract me...

394
00:24:08,131 --> 00:24:09,765
...with your kinky fuckery.

395
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:12,168
- "Kinky fuckery"?
- Mm-hmm.

396
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:14,070
I don't know what that is.

397
00:24:14,071 --> 00:24:16,964
But I like the sound of it.

398
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:56,478
You looked so peaceful,
I didn't want to wake you.

399
00:24:58,548 --> 00:25:00,817
There's not much for breakfast,...

400
00:25:00,818 --> 00:25:02,852
...unless you want cold stir-fry.

401
00:25:02,853 --> 00:25:05,201
No.

402
00:25:08,191 --> 00:25:10,392
Here. The check
you gave me for Wanda,...

403
00:25:10,393 --> 00:25:12,394
- ...you should have it back.
- Keep it.

404
00:25:12,395 --> 00:25:15,197
Keep it? It's $24,000.

405
00:25:15,198 --> 00:25:16,999
Ana.

406
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,302
I make that kind of money
every 15 minutes. Keep it.

407
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,428
- <i>Yes, Mr. Grey.</i>
- Andrea, good morning.

408
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:48,931
Could you please transfer $24,000...

409
00:25:48,932 --> 00:25:50,900
...into the account
of Miss Anastasia Steele?

410
00:25:50,901 --> 00:25:52,024
No. What are you doing?

411
00:25:52,035 --> 00:25:55,237
That's fine. Thank you.

412
00:25:55,238 --> 00:25:56,939
<i>You're welcome.</i>

413
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,009
Why do you have my bank account details?

414
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,311
What's good for breakfast around here?

415
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:05,137
Christian, how do you have
my bank information?

416
00:26:10,087 --> 00:26:13,122
Thank you.

417
00:26:13,123 --> 00:26:15,591
Got to be quicker than that, Grey.

418
00:26:18,461 --> 00:26:22,164
My parents are hosting
a charity ball tonight.

419
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:24,400
I promised I'd make an appearance.

420
00:26:24,401 --> 00:26:26,402
Want you to come with me.

421
00:26:26,403 --> 00:26:28,404
<i>- The food is really good.
- Oh, yeah, really good.</i>

422
00:26:28,405 --> 00:26:30,639
I've never been to a ball.

423
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,242
I don't have...
I don't have a dress for that.

424
00:26:33,243 --> 00:26:35,577
Also, uh, what am I
gonna do with my hair?

425
00:26:35,578 --> 00:26:37,212
I know a salon.

426
00:26:37,214 --> 00:26:39,381
And you don't need
to worry about a dress.

427
00:26:39,382 --> 00:26:41,357
It's all gonna be taken care of it.

428
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,055
- What is it?
- Um--

429
00:26:46,056 --> 00:26:48,290
There was just a girl over there,...

430
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:50,492
...and she was outside
my office yesterday.

431
00:26:50,493 --> 00:26:52,561
And she knew my name.

432
00:26:52,562 --> 00:26:54,596
And she had a bandage on her wrist.

433
00:26:54,597 --> 00:26:56,639
It was really strange.

434
00:26:58,969 --> 00:27:01,181
We should go.

435
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:07,143
Just now.

436
00:27:07,144 --> 00:27:08,945
Yeah.

437
00:27:08,946 --> 00:27:11,613
Keep me informed.

438
00:27:14,017 --> 00:27:16,018
You know that girl, Christian?

439
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:17,075
I'm handling it.

440
00:27:17,087 --> 00:27:18,720
What does that mean?

441
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:20,288
Don't want you to worry about it.

442
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,447
Trust me.

443
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,128
<i>Yes, when were you
thinking of coming in?</i>

444
00:27:26,129 --> 00:27:29,665
One moment, let me put you on hold.

445
00:27:29,666 --> 00:27:31,640
Um--

446
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,271
<i>Hey. How you doing?</i>

447
00:27:35,272 --> 00:27:37,073
Good. Okay.

448
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:39,141
So, uh, my girlfriend's here...

449
00:27:44,514 --> 00:27:47,083
- Done.
- Okay, fine.

450
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:48,241
Oh.

451
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:52,604
- Hey, how are you doing? Good.
- Christian, I missed you.

452
00:28:04,101 --> 00:28:05,564
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

453
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:22,577
Ana.

454
00:28:25,088 --> 00:28:27,156
Is that Mrs. Robinson?

455
00:28:27,157 --> 00:28:29,125
Her name's Elena Lincoln.

456
00:28:29,126 --> 00:28:31,027
I don't care
what her name is, Christian.

457
00:28:31,028 --> 00:28:32,661
Why would you take me there?

458
00:28:32,662 --> 00:28:35,431
Why would you take me to meet
the woman who seduced...

459
00:28:35,432 --> 00:28:38,067
- ...and abused you?
- Our relationship ended years ago.

460
00:28:38,068 --> 00:28:39,327
We're just friends.

461
00:28:39,336 --> 00:28:40,765
And business partners.

462
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:43,221
Business partners?
Are you kidding me?

463
00:28:44,274 --> 00:28:46,642
Would you take your subs there?

464
00:28:48,678 --> 00:28:51,613
Oh, my God.
For what, her approval?

465
00:28:51,614 --> 00:28:53,146
- What?
- What is this?

466
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,384
No, it's... it's not like that.

467
00:28:55,385 --> 00:28:56,610
That girl that I saw this morning...

468
00:28:56,619 --> 00:28:58,151
...was one of them, wasn't she?

469
00:28:58,155 --> 00:28:59,720
Let's discuss this back at my place.

470
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:02,058
I can have someone
come by, do your hair.

471
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:03,488
Christian, I don't care about my hair.

472
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:05,361
Explain to me what's going on.

473
00:29:05,362 --> 00:29:07,829
I'll explain when we're there.
Come on.

474
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,599
Okay, you can either walk,
or I can carry you.

475
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,757
- Your choice.
- You wouldn't do that.

476
00:29:11,768 --> 00:29:14,270
No, it's your choice.

477
00:29:15,605 --> 00:29:17,579
Okay, fine. Fine. I'll walk.

478
00:29:22,212 --> 00:29:24,680
<i>Her name's Leila Williams.</i>

479
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:27,316
She was my sub for a while
about two years ago.

480
00:29:27,317 --> 00:29:29,427
What happened to her?

481
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,155
She wanted more; I didn't.

482
00:29:33,156 --> 00:29:35,131
So I ended it.

483
00:29:36,326 --> 00:29:38,627
She... left, got married.

484
00:29:38,628 --> 00:29:41,197
I thought she moved on,
but then her husband died...

485
00:29:41,198 --> 00:29:42,355
...in a car crash.

486
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:44,340
She had a breakdown.

487
00:29:46,736 --> 00:29:50,106
What does she want now?

488
00:29:50,107 --> 00:29:52,108
When you and I were
in Georgia together,...

489
00:29:52,109 --> 00:29:54,343
...she turned up here
and tried to slit her wrists...

490
00:29:54,344 --> 00:29:56,178
...in front of Mrs. Jones,
my housekeeper.

491
00:29:56,179 --> 00:29:57,370
Oh, my God.

492
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,215
Gail took her to the hospital.

493
00:29:59,216 --> 00:30:02,751
But by the time I got there,
she'd taken off.

494
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:06,155
My people have been trying to find her.

495
00:30:06,156 --> 00:30:08,790
Your people?

496
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:11,379
Is that who put this together?

497
00:30:15,132 --> 00:30:17,241
Is there one on me?

498
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:23,712
Let me see it.

499

501
00:30:55,538 --> 00:30:58,942
You know, they didn't time
my bathroom breaks.

502
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,578
You should probably get your money back.

503
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:04,580
I had them drawn up...

504
00:31:04,581 --> 00:31:06,582
...on any prospective submissive.

505
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:08,950
Ha! Nice. Jesus.

506
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:11,253
You know, I had no idea what this...

507
00:31:11,254 --> 00:31:13,289
...was gonna become--
I didn't know you'd be different.

508
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,582
Different?

509
00:31:14,591 --> 00:31:17,226
Really?

510
00:31:17,227 --> 00:31:19,461
Is that why you brought
me to Mrs. Robinson's,...

511
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:21,463
...where you brought
all the other women?

512
00:31:21,464 --> 00:31:23,439
Because I'm so different?

513
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:26,702
That was wrong, I admit.

514
00:31:26,703 --> 00:31:29,392
It's all wrong.
All of this is wrong.

515
00:31:31,941 --> 00:31:35,877
You put money into my account
that... I... I don't want it.

516
00:31:35,878 --> 00:31:39,848
You bought the company I work for.

517
00:31:39,849 --> 00:31:43,593
This isn't a relationship,
Christian, it's ownership.

518
00:31:44,621 --> 00:31:47,556
I'm trying to understand you.

519
00:31:47,557 --> 00:31:49,891
I am...

520
00:31:49,892 --> 00:31:52,888
...just wanting to get close to you.

521
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:56,465
But it's really difficult to do that...

522
00:31:56,466 --> 00:31:58,634
...when you keep doing
bizarre things like this.

523
00:31:58,635 --> 00:32:00,636
And it's really difficult to do that...

524
00:32:00,637 --> 00:32:02,781
...when you won't let me touch you.

525
00:32:11,581 --> 00:32:14,916
Come to my bedroom.

526
00:32:14,917 --> 00:32:17,919
Sex is not gonna fix this
right now. Are you insane?

527

531

532
00:33:23,853 --> 00:33:26,678

00:47:50,652 --> 00:47:52,787
...you'll let him go.

825
00:47:52,788 --> 00:47:55,723
There's no way that someone like you...

826
00:47:55,724 --> 00:47:58,326
...could ever understand what we have.

827
00:47:58,327 --> 00:47:59,722
I've been there.

828
00:47:59,728 --> 00:48:01,962
Nothing lasts.

829
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:03,632
Nothing.

830
00:48:03,632 --> 00:48:06,634
Whatever happens
between me and Christian...

831
00:48:06,635 --> 00:48:08,903
...is none of your goddamn business.

832
00:48:08,904 --> 00:48:11,422
So you stay the fuck away from us.

833
00:48:16,945 --> 00:48:18,846
<i>Hey.</i>

834
00:48:18,847 --> 00:48:20,748
We should think about going soon.

835
00:48:20,749 --> 00:48:22,893
I want to go now.

836
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,834
What did Elena say to you?

837
00:48:37,766 --> 00:48:41,408
Nothing I didn't already know.

838
00:48:45,507 --> 00:48:47,957
Will you just take me to my house?

839
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,325
Stay with me tonight.

840
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:03,991
Hey, wake up. We're home.

841
00:49:11,867 --> 00:49:14,302
Sir.

842
00:49:14,303 --> 00:49:15,834
Stay here.

843
00:49:31,753 --> 00:49:33,422
<i>No.</i>

844
00:49:33,422 --> 00:49:35,856
Yeah, her car is totally trashed.

845
00:49:35,857 --> 00:49:37,958
They're fine.

846
00:49:37,959 --> 00:49:39,994
They're okay.

847
00:49:39,995 --> 00:49:41,829
Well, I think we're gonna...

848
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:43,396
...head over there now.

849
00:49:43,399 --> 00:49:46,000
- We'll have the car towed.
- <i>What happened?</i>

850
00:49:46,001 --> 00:49:48,536
That's my car.
What happened to my car?

851
00:49:48,537 --> 00:49:50,605
Check the apartment.
Call me when it's safe.

852
00:49:50,606 --> 00:49:51,933
Yes, sir. Right away.

853
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:53,708
Smith, you stick with Mr. Grey.

854
00:49:53,709 --> 00:49:57,545
- Stay with Mr. Grey.
- Where are we going?

855
00:49:57,546 --> 00:49:59,514
Christian?

856
00:49:59,515 --> 00:50:02,016
<i>Do you think it was Leila?</i>

857
00:50:02,017 --> 00:50:04,876
You really think she would do
something like that?

858
00:50:07,623 --> 00:50:10,758
I really don't see why we can't
just go back to your apartment.

859
00:50:10,759 --> 00:50:12,760
That place is like a fortress.

860
00:50:12,761 --> 00:50:15,496
There's no way she
could have gotten in there.

861
00:50:15,497 --> 00:50:18,399
She shouldn't have been able
to get into the garage, either.

862
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,510
I'm not taking any chances.

863
00:50:27,743 --> 00:50:29,744
Good evening, Mr. Grey.

864
00:50:29,745 --> 00:50:32,747
Hey, Ed.

865
00:50:32,748 --> 00:50:36,730
The rest of the crew
will be here in the morning.

866
00:50:41,523 --> 00:50:44,892
If something were to happen
to you because of me...

867
00:50:44,893 --> 00:50:47,061
It won't.

868
00:50:47,062 --> 00:50:49,411
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

869
00:50:56,938 --> 00:50:58,913
Can I wash this off?

870
00:51:02,378 --> 00:51:04,379
Don't stray from the lines.

871
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:05,843
Okay.

872
00:51:36,712 --> 00:51:38,821
<i>Are these burns?</i>

873
00:51:40,782 --> 00:51:42,926
Who did this to you?

874
00:51:44,953 --> 00:51:46,927
Go on, it's over.

875
00:51:52,828 --> 00:51:56,964
I know how difficult it is for you to...

876
00:51:56,965 --> 00:51:59,199
...open up to me...

877
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,569
...and...

878
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:03,646
...tell me these things.

879
00:52:06,642 --> 00:52:09,126
But it means the world to me.

880
00:52:11,012 --> 00:52:13,156
It means you love me.

881
00:52:14,783 --> 00:52:15,974
Yes.

882
00:52:15,984 --> 00:52:17,822
I do.

883
00:52:38,474 --> 00:52:41,537
Mm.

884
00:52:45,581 --> 00:52:46,873
So this is where...

885
00:52:46,882 --> 00:52:49,484
...your knot-tying expertise comes from.

886
00:52:49,485 --> 00:52:50,914
Good morning.

887
00:52:50,919 --> 00:52:52,953
You sleep well?

888
00:52:52,954 --> 00:52:54,588
I did.

889
00:52:56,725 --> 00:52:58,859
This boat is really beautiful.

890
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:01,596
This is from my yard in Seattle.

891
00:53:01,597 --> 00:53:02,889
You built it?

892
00:53:02,898 --> 00:53:04,899
I had some help.

893
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:07,589
It's called The Grace.

894
00:53:09,004 --> 00:53:10,771
After your mom?

895
00:53:10,772 --> 00:53:12,607
You sound surprised.

896
00:53:12,608 --> 00:53:17,011
Well, you're always so cool
towards her, and...

897
00:53:17,012 --> 00:53:19,113
I owe everything to Grace.

898
00:53:19,114 --> 00:53:22,109
She saved my life
after my birth mom died.

899
00:53:23,985 --> 00:53:27,021
Do you remember your birth mom?

900
00:53:27,022 --> 00:53:29,064
I try not to.

901
00:53:30,926 --> 00:53:33,581
What happened to her?

902
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:35,514
She overdosed.

903
00:53:35,531 --> 00:53:38,628
They found her body three days later.

904
00:53:40,068 --> 00:53:42,036
Where were you?

905
00:53:42,037 --> 00:53:43,875
I was with her.

906
00:53:45,541 --> 00:53:47,174
Oh, my God.

907
00:53:48,744 --> 00:53:50,955
Took her away.
Took me to a hospital.

908
00:53:52,614 --> 00:53:54,009
Grace was there.

909
00:53:57,786 --> 00:53:59,760
Thank you for telling me.

910
00:54:04,826 --> 00:54:07,311
Look at that house.

911
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:10,865
That's beautiful.

912
00:54:10,866 --> 00:54:12,667
The view's probably amazing.

913
00:54:12,668 --> 00:54:14,669
I wonder who lives there.

914
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:16,771
It's an old sea widow.

915
00:54:16,772 --> 00:54:18,939
Lost her husband years ago.

916
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:22,786
Sits at the window every night
waiting for him to come home.

917
00:54:23,945 --> 00:54:25,980
Did you just make that up?

918
00:54:25,981 --> 00:54:28,125
Yeah.

919
00:54:29,685 --> 00:54:31,752
You want to take the helm?

920
00:54:31,753 --> 00:54:33,621
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

921
00:54:33,622 --> 00:54:34,881
Come on.

922
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:36,182

Personal calls on your own time, okay?

- Yeah?
- Um, did you get my message?

961
00:56:09,017 --> 00:56:11,218
You had a phone call this morning...

962
00:56:11,219 --> 00:56:13,788
...with Ruth Carusi at 9:00 a.m.

963
00:56:13,789 --> 00:56:15,823
Shit.

964
00:56:15,824 --> 00:56:17,825
I can just reschedule it.
I'll ask them.

965
00:56:17,826 --> 00:56:20,208
Did you book our rooms for New York yet?

966
00:56:21,262 --> 00:56:22,692
Sorry?

967
00:56:22,698 --> 00:56:24,025
New York. Book expo.

968
00:56:24,032 --> 00:56:25,866
This Friday. It's in the diary.

969
00:56:25,867 --> 00:56:28,435
N... Yeah, I know, yeah,
I booked your room. Of course.

970
00:56:28,436 --> 00:56:30,002
And you.

971
00:56:30,005 --> 00:56:32,796
It's expected that my assistant
also attends.

972
00:56:34,142 --> 00:56:36,276
I didn't know that. I'm sorry.

973
00:56:36,277 --> 00:56:40,815
Don't apologize.
Just get yourself a room.

974
00:56:40,816 --> 00:56:43,818
Unless you'd rather stay back
with your boyfriend.

975
00:56:43,819 --> 00:56:46,353
I mean, it's not like you need to work.

976
00:56:49,357 --> 00:56:51,091
I'll sort it out.

977
00:56:51,092 --> 00:56:53,236
Eric, hey, it's Jack.
How was your weekend?

978
00:56:56,197 --> 00:56:57,998
<i>No shit?</i>

979
00:56:57,999 --> 00:57:01,468
Hey, no, mine, mine was great.
It was fantastic.

980
00:57:01,469 --> 00:57:04,371
Yeah, 'cause I read your new pages.

981
00:57:04,372 --> 00:57:07,107
No, they're amazing. Amazing.

982
00:57:07,108 --> 00:57:09,176
No, I couldn't put it down.

983
00:57:09,177 --> 00:57:11,245
We'll be accessing state and
federal grants, of course,...

984
00:57:11,246 --> 00:57:13,347
...but more than 70% of the funding...

985
00:57:13,348 --> 00:57:16,316
...will come directly from
Grey Enterprises Holdings.

986
00:57:16,317 --> 00:57:18,485
We'll be making cutting-edge
renewable energy tech...

987
00:57:18,486 --> 00:57:20,801
...that will more than

01:00:16,998 --> 01:00:19,516
I'll have to talk to Mrs. Jones.

Come here. Give me your hand.

1041
01:01:18,359 --> 01:01:20,401
...before we run.

1042
01:01:21,462 --> 01:01:23,980
I kind of like running.

- Hmm?

1044
01:01:30,171 --> 01:01:32,172
The last time we did this,...

1045
01:01:32,173 --> 01:01:34,608

1133
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,934
It was, you know, when somebody talks...

1134
01:05:54,935 --> 01:05:58,538

and you resolve an issue.

need anything, I'm available.

tremendous potential here.

1151
01:07:09,844 --> 01:07:11,845
But I don't want to waste
my time training...

1152
01:07:11,846 --> 01:07:14,414
...someone who doesn't
take this position seriously.

1153
01:07:14,415 --> 01:07:16,014
I do. Um—

1154
01:07:16,016 --> 01:07:18,017
This is my dream job.

1155
01:07:18,018 --> 01:07:19,516
Well, then shouldn't
going to New York...

1156
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,355
...and the book expo
be part of that dream?

1157
01:07:21,356 --> 01:07:23,357
It is.

1158
01:07:23,358 --> 01:07:25,025
It is. Um, uh--

1159
01:07:25,025 --> 01:07:26,926
It was just a misunderstanding.

1160
01:07:26,927 --> 01:07:28,895
- It won't happen again.
- Because there are plenty...

1161
01:07:28,896 --> 01:07:32,699
...of qualified people
who would kill for this job.

1162
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,834
I mean, look, I don't want to brag,...

1163
01:07:34,835 --> 01:07:36,912
...but I'm a pretty great teacher.

1164
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:40,039
I'm sure you are.

1165
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:44,043
I'm just not seeing the
initiative on your side of it.

1166
01:07:45,413 --> 01:07:47,547
I've read more than you've asked me to.

1167
01:07:47,548 --> 01:07:50,384
And I...
I... I'm on top of every--

1168
01:07:50,385 --> 01:07:54,400
I'm talking about going the extra mile.

1169
01:07:55,656 --> 01:07:57,724
Unless you want me to...

1170
01:07:57,725 --> 01:08:02,028
...compete with Christian Grey...

1171
01:08:02,029 --> 01:08:03,830
...for your attention.

1172
01:08:03,831 --> 01:08:05,665
I'm... I apologize...

1173
01:08:05,666 --> 01:08:09,168
...that... Christian was so curt
with you the other night.

1174
01:08:09,169 --> 01:08:11,705
Is that what this is about?

1175
01:08:11,706 --> 01:08:13,707
Your boyfriend...

1176
01:08:13,708 --> 01:08:16,976
...has a reputation for being...

1177
01:08:16,977 --> 01:08:19,012
...a little ruthless.

1178
01:08:19,013 --> 01:08:21,014
Is that what you like?

1179
01:08:21,015 --> 01:08:22,649
If you have a problem with my work,...

1180
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:24,079
...then you should take it up with HR.

1181
01:08:24,084 --> 01:08:27,587
Whoa. Why are you being so serious?

1182
01:08:27,588 --> 01:08:29,589
Wh... What do you think I'm gonna do,...

1183
01:08:29,590 --> 01:08:32,526
- ...make you fuck me?
- Jack.

1184
01:08:32,527 --> 01:08:34,125
I just think--

1185
01:08:35,830 --> 01:08:38,932
I just think...

1186
01:08:38,933 --> 01:08:41,435
...if you're gonna fuck
your way to prominence,...

1187
01:08:41,436 --> 01:08:43,470
...that you should do it with someone...

1188
01:08:43,471 --> 01:08:46,706
...who can at least make you smarter.

1189
01:08:46,707 --> 01:08:48,875
Not just richer.

1190
01:08:48,876 --> 01:08:52,145
Right?

1191
01:08:52,146 --> 01:08:55,005
- Don't--
- Don't what? Hmm?

1192
01:08:56,183 --> 01:08:58,718
Now, this is a serious--

1193
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:00,694
Serious question.

1194
01:09:01,756 --> 01:09:05,692
Do you want to be kept...

1195
01:09:05,693 --> 01:09:08,462
...or taken seriously?

1196
01:09:08,463 --> 01:09:11,030
- Hmm?
- I would like to leave, please, Jack.

1197
01:09:11,031 --> 01:09:14,100
Plus--

1198
01:09:14,101 --> 01:09:16,970
I can make you come...

1199
01:09:16,971 --> 01:09:19,149
...like nobody else has.

1200
01:09:20,908 --> 01:09:23,777
Not him.

1201
01:09:23,778 --> 01:09:25,845
- Not anyone.
- No.

1202
01:09:36,591 --> 01:09:38,087
Ana? Ana, what happened?

1203
01:09:38,092 --> 01:09:39,726
Jack... Hyde.

1204
01:09:39,727 --> 01:09:41,224
Jack tried to...

1205
01:09:41,228 --> 01:09:44,163
- ...to touch me.
- I'll kill him.

1206
01:09:44,164 --> 01:09:45,965
No, no, please don't go.
Don't go. Don't leave me.

1207
01:09:45,966 --> 01:09:47,089
Okay. Go.

1208
01:09:47,101 --> 01:09:49,736
It's okay. Hey.

1209
01:09:49,737 --> 01:09:52,572
I left everything.
I don't have any of my stuff.

1210
01:09:52,573 --> 01:09:54,206
Taylor will get it. Taylor
will get it. It's fine, okay?

1211
01:09:54,208 --> 01:09:55,842
I'll take you home. Come on.

1212
01:09:55,843 --> 01:09:58,712
And his pass has been canceled?

1213
01:09:58,713 --> 01:10:00,714
Good.

1214
01:10:00,715 --> 01:10:02,042
No. Thank you, Jerry.

1215
01:10:02,049 --> 01:10:03,717
Good night.

1216
01:10:07,054 --> 01:10:09,155
Well, at least that's dealt with.

1217
01:10:09,156 --> 01:10:11,858
Hyde's out. He's been fired.

1218
01:10:11,859 --> 01:10:13,152
Whoa.

1219
01:10:14,995 --> 01:10:17,263
How? That's--

1220
01:10:17,264 --> 01:10:19,298
You... I...
But I thought your deal...

1221
01:10:19,299 --> 01:10:21,635
...with SIP hasn't been finished yet.

1222
01:10:21,636 --> 01:10:22,928
It's not.

1223
01:10:22,937 --> 01:10:25,539
But I know the CEO.

1224
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:27,607
I told him what happened.

1225
01:10:27,608 --> 01:10:29,843
You'll never have to see him again.

1226
01:10:29,844 --> 01:10:33,613
Am I still gonna have a job
now that he's not there?

1227
01:10:33,614 --> 01:10:36,049
Well, if you don't, you can...
you can just--

1228
01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:38,918
Christian, you know I love working.

1229
01:10:38,919 --> 01:10:41,982
You can't keep me locked up
in your penthouse.

1230
01:10:46,861 --> 01:10:48,970
What if I gave you a key?

1231
01:10:50,230 --> 01:10:51,728
I mean--

1232
01:10:51,732 --> 01:10:53,161
What if you had a key,...

1233
01:10:53,167 --> 01:10:55,635
...and you kept some
of your stuff here--

1234
01:10:55,636 --> 01:10:57,704
You can keep all of your stuff here--

1235
01:10:57,705 --> 01:10:58,828
And--

1236
01:10:58,839 --> 01:11:01,207
And you slept, you know,...

1237
01:11:01,208 --> 01:11:03,625
...not at your place?

1238
01:11:05,846 --> 01:11:09,148
Are you asking me to
move i--in with you?

1239
01:11:11,151 --> 01:11:13,119
Mm-hmm.

1240
01:11:14,655 --> 01:11:16,152
Are you sure?

1241
01:11:16,156 --> 01:11:17,994
Yes.

1242
01:11:19,093 --> 01:11:21,611
I want you here all the time.

1243
01:11:22,897 --> 01:11:25,210
As soon as possible.

1244
01:11:31,005 --> 01:11:35,174
What happened to learning
to walk before we run?

1245
01:11:35,175 --> 01:11:37,243
Well, that's just one
of the many things...

1246
01:11:37,244 --> 01:11:39,613
...that we can talk about
over breakfast.

1247
01:11:44,251 --> 01:11:47,086
Can I think about it?

1248
01:11:47,087 --> 01:11:49,355
Sure.

1249
01:11:49,356 --> 01:11:50,956
Yeah.

1250
01:11:59,099 --> 01:12:00,834
Liz, hi.

1251
01:12:00,835 --> 01:12:03,837
Ana. Don't know if you heard,
but Jack resigned last night.

1252
01:12:03,838 --> 01:12:05,199
In kind of a hurry.

1253
01:12:05,205 --> 01:12:08,775
SIP isn't recruiting right now,
so we're screwed.

1254
01:12:08,776 --> 01:12:10,810
So you don't need me anymore, then?

1255
01:12:10,811 --> 01:12:12,646
We're gonna try to find you
something temporary.

1256
01:12:12,647 --> 01:12:15,181
Could you fill in for Jack
at this morning's meeting?

1257
01:12:15,182 --> 01:12:17,083
At the senior editors' meeting?

1258
01:12:17,084 --> 01:12:18,785
Just for today.
You're the only one...

1259
01:12:18,786 --> 01:12:20,011
...who knows Jack's entire slate.

1260
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:22,789
Well, yeah, but I.. I.. I--

1261
01:12:25,392 --> 01:12:27,366
You're right, it's too much.

1262
01:12:29,697 --> 01:12:31,671
No, I can do it.

1263
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:35,142
It's fine. I can do it.

1264
01:12:36,370 --> 01:12:37,765
Great.

1265
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:42,250
Call me when you're done.

1266
01:12:44,444 --> 01:12:46,145
We need to print fewer titles.

1267
01:12:46,146 --> 01:12:48,114
Stick with established authors,...

1268
01:12:48,115 --> 01:12:49,816
...focus on our core readership.

1269
01:12:49,817 --> 01:12:51,246
Ex... Expand it.

1270
01:12:51,251 --> 01:12:53,319
I'm sorry?

1271
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:55,188
Um, uh--

1272
01:12:55,189 --> 01:12:57,400
So, Ana, what do you think
we should be publishing?

1273
01:12:59,727 --> 01:13:02,696
Um, well, newer voices.

1274
01:13:02,697 --> 01:13:04,798
- Along with your established authors.
- Uh..huh.

1275
01:13:04,799 --> 01:13:07,166
Boyce Fox, for example, got...

1276
01:13:07,167 --> 01:13:09,068
...80,000 hits last week.

1277
01:13:09,069 --> 01:13:11,437
- Really?
- <i>Online hits...</i>

1278
01:13:11,438 --> 01:13:13,439
<i>...don't automatically
translate to print sales.</i>

1279
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,006
Well--

1280
01:13:15,009 --> 01:13:16,743
But they could.

1281
01:13:16,744 --> 01:13:19,879
His online audience is in the
18-to-24 demographic,...

1282
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,344
...and those are exactly the readers...

1283
01:13:21,348 --> 01:13:23,016
...that we should be chasing.

1284
01:13:23,017 --> 01:13:25,218
Um, I mean, I can show you the stats.

1285
01:13:25,219 --> 01:13:27,874
I really... I think
he's worth taking a risk on.

1286
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:31,925
Maybe we should take a look.

1287
01:13:31,926 --> 01:13:33,049
W...

1288
01:13:41,836 --> 01:13:44,838
Great idea.

1289
01:13:44,839 --> 01:13:47,140
Uh, Ana? Ana, just, uh...

1290
01:13:47,141 --> 01:13:49,876
Mr. Roach, I'm really sorry
if I was out of line.

1291
01:13:49,877 --> 01:13:52,078
No, don't be sorry.
You made a lot of sense.

1292
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:56,182
No, so, uh, what are you doing
now that Jack Hyde's gone?

1293
01:13:56,183 --> 01:13:59,919
Um, well, Liz mentioned
something temporary.

1294
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,247
- I.. I don't know.
- Okay.

1295
01:14:01,255 --> 01:14:04,157
So why don't you fill in
for Jack temporarily?

1296
01:14:04,158 --> 01:14:06,893
- Good?
- Um--

1297
01:14:06,894 --> 01:14:08,762
Great. Okay.

1298
01:14:08,763 --> 01:14:10,124
That's settled.

1299
01:15:00,414 --> 01:15:02,581
<i>To SIP's new fiction editor.</i>

1300
01:15:02,582 --> 01:15:05,218
Acting fiction editor.

1301
01:15:05,219 --> 01:15:07,253
Till they find out how good you are.

1302
01:15:10,224 --> 01:15:12,358
Christian, did you have
something to do with this?

1303
01:15:12,359 --> 01:15:14,060
No.

1304
01:15:14,061 --> 01:15:16,239
Hey, it was all you.

1305
01:15:18,298 --> 01:15:20,033
What, you don't believe me?

1306
01:15:20,034 --> 01:15:22,212
I don't believe it myself.

1307
01:15:26,306 --> 01:15:28,307
I asked you a question last night.

1308
01:15:28,308 --> 01:15:30,944
About moving in with you?

1309
01:15:30,945 --> 01:15:33,089
Emmh.

1310
01:15:36,483 --> 01:15:40,153

She's been gone for three hours,...

1506
01:30:45,258 --> 01:30:47,878
...and she doesn't have
her cell or her purse.

1507
01:30:51,898 --> 01:30:53,872
Forget it. She's here.

1508
01:30:57,904 --> 01:30:59,878
Where the fuck have you been?

1509
01:31:02,942 --> 01:31:05,010
I told you to come straight here.

1510
01:31:05,011 --> 01:31:07,880
I've had people out combing
the streets looking for you.

1511
01:31:07,881 --> 01:31:10,048
I'm sorry I don't always do as I'm told.

1512
01:31:10,049 --> 01:31:12,217
Maybe you just really need someone...

1513
01:31:12,218 --> 01:31:13,545
...who obeys every command.

1514
01:31:13,552 --> 01:31:15,921
Don't be ridiculous.

1515
01:31:15,922 --> 01:31:17,823
I saw you, Christian.

1516
01:31:17,824 --> 01:31:20,025
I saw the way you were with Leila.

1517
01:31:20,026 --> 01:31:22,194
She had a gun, Ana.

1518
01:31:22,195 --> 01:31:24,033
I would have done anything
to subdue her.

1519
01:31:25,932 --> 01:31:28,233
Where is she now?

1520
01:31:28,234 --> 01:31:29,459
Is she here?

1521
01:31:29,468 --> 01:31:30,898
What?

1522
01:31:30,904 --> 01:31:32,435
No, of course not.

1523
01:31:32,438 --> 01:31:34,786
She's in the psych ward getting
the help that she needs.

1524
01:31:37,877 --> 01:31:40,345
- Look, I know she scared you.
- Yeah.

1525
01:31:40,346 --> 01:31:43,515
She scared me.

1526
01:31:43,516 --> 01:31:45,951
But you scared me more.

1527
01:31:45,952 --> 01:31:49,254
Seeing you like that with her.

1528
01:31:49,255 --> 01:31:51,089
I'll never be able to give you...

1529
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:55,160
...that kind of submission
and obedience.

1530
01:31:55,161 --> 01:31:57,162
Ana...

1531
01:31:57,163 --> 01:31:59,965
Don't crowd me. I need space.

1532
01:31:59,966 --> 01:32:01,967
- Ana, please don't do this.
- Christian.

1533
01:32:01,968 --> 01:32:02,784
Don't give up on me.

1534
01:32:02,802 --> 01:32:04,970
I just need to think a little bit.

1535
01:32:04,971 --> 01:32:07,251
Don't leave me.

1536
01:32:10,844 --> 01:32:13,411
What are you doing?

1537
01:32:13,412 --> 01:32:14,910
Get up.

1538
01:32:18,051 --> 01:32:20,385
What are you doing?

1539
01:32:20,386 --> 01:32:22,360
Look at me.

1540
01:32:23,489 --> 01:32:25,225
Look at me.

1541
01:32:31,564 --> 01:32:33,538
I'm scared.

1542
01:32:38,004 --> 01:32:39,978
I know you say that I'm enough.

1543
01:32:43,409 --> 01:32:46,211
But there are certain things
that you are used to getting...

1544
01:32:46,212 --> 01:32:49,547
...that I will never, ever,
ever be able to give you.

1545
01:32:52,551 --> 01:32:55,387
And it might be fine for right now,...

1546
01:32:55,388 --> 01:32:59,557
...but what's gonna happen when
you start needing them again?

1547
01:32:59,558 --> 01:33:00,647
I won't.

1548
01:33:00,659 --> 01:33:02,293
How do you know that?

1549
01:33:02,295 --> 01:33:03,929
How can I believe you?

1550
01:33:03,930 --> 01:33:06,031
I don't even understand
your need to dominate.

1551
01:33:06,032 --> 01:33:08,400
- It doesn't--
- I'm not a dominant.

1552
01:33:08,401 --> 01:33:10,635
I'm not. I--

1553
01:33:10,636 --> 01:33:14,006
The right term is a sadist.

1554
01:33:14,007 --> 01:33:16,674
I get off on punishing women,
women who look like you and...

1555
01:33:16,675 --> 01:33:19,111
Like your mother.

1556
01:33:19,112 --> 01:33:21,980
Yes.

1557
01:33:21,981 --> 01:33:25,217
And I know how fucked up that is.

1558
01:33:25,218 --> 01:33:29,554
When you left, I swore
that I would stop it,...

1559
01:33:29,555 --> 01:33:31,957
...if that's what it took
to get you back.

1560
01:33:31,958 --> 01:33:35,060
But I'm done with it.

1561
01:33:35,061 --> 01:33:39,043
You mean more to me than anything else.

1562
01:33:42,068 --> 01:33:43,599
I want to believe you.

1563
01:33:43,602 --> 01:33:45,202
I do.

1564
01:33:45,204 --> 01:33:47,450
- But I can't. I--
- Ana, give me your hand.

1565
01:33:52,045 --> 01:33:55,047
This is me.

1566
01:33:55,048 --> 01:33:56,409
All of me.

1567
01:33:56,415 --> 01:33:58,683
Christian.

1568
01:33:58,684 --> 01:34:00,485
And I'm all yours.

It's okay. I'm right here.

1574

What?

1577
01:35:26,439 --> 01:35:28,752
I want you to marry me.

01:36:46,452 --> 01:36:48,686

Hmm.

1600
01:37:09,142 --> 01:37:10,740
I mean, there was a little thing...

1601
01:37:10,743 --> 01:37:13,278
...of asking you to marry me,
but, uh, aside from that,...

1602
01:37:13,279 --> 01:37:14,606
...no, nothing.

1603
01:37:14,613 --> 01:37:16,145
Don't mess with me like that.

1604
01:37:16,149 --> 01:37:17,476
No?

1605
01:37:17,483 --> 01:37:18,844
How should I mess with you?

1606
01:37:18,851 --> 01:37:20,852
Like this?

1607
01:37:20,853 --> 01:37:22,385
Huh?

1608
01:37:22,388 --> 01:37:24,362
That better?

1609
01:37:29,262 --> 01:37:31,829
I meant it.

1610
01:37:31,830 --> 01:37:33,698
I want to marry you.

1611
01:37:33,699 --> 01:37:35,673
Why?

1612
01:37:37,370 --> 01:37:39,771
Because I want to spend every second...

1613
01:37:39,772 --> 01:37:42,767
...of the rest of my life with you.

1614
01:37:48,914 --> 01:37:52,784
I don't expect you
to say yes right away.

1615
01:37:52,785 --> 01:37:54,282
I know I'm complicated.

1616
01:37:56,355 --> 01:37:58,556

<i>You have an assistant?</i>

1618
01:38:04,563 --> 01:38:06,431
I thought you were an assistant.

1619
01:38:08,267 --> 01:38:10,202
It's a long story.
What's going on?

1620
01:38:10,203 --> 01:38:12,437
What do I give Christian
for his birthday?

1621
01:38:12,438 --> 01:38:15,973
The boy already has everything
except a sense of humor.

1622
01:38:15,974 --> 01:38:19,344
Uh, his wh... his birthday?

1623
01:38:19,345 --> 01:38:20,706
When is his birthday?

1624
01:38:20,713 --> 01:38:22,312
Sunday. He didn't tell you?

1625
01:38:22,315 --> 01:38:23,540
He is so weird.

1626
01:38:23,549 --> 01:38:25,617
Mom and Dad are throwing him a party.

1627
01:38:25,618 --> 01:38:27,319
Didn't they just have a party?

1628
01:38:27,320 --> 01:38:28,918
Geez, you're as bad as he is.

1629
01:38:28,921 --> 01:38:29,976
That was a ball.

1630
01:38:29,988 --> 01:38:32,757
This is just family, friends,
music, fireworks.

1631
01:38:32,758 --> 01:38:33,745
No biggie.

1632
01:38:33,759 --> 01:38:35,627
Hey, what about a tie?

1633
01:38:35,628 --> 01:38:39,431
Uh, uh, Christian has a lot of ties.

1634
01:38:39,432 --> 01:38:41,433
Socks, suspenders--
Throw me a bone here?

1635
01:38:41,434 --> 01:38:42,863
Um, oh.

1636
01:38:42,868 --> 01:38:44,669
God, Mia, I got to go.

1637
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:47,339
Okay, okay. But Sunday
or I'll hunt you down myself.

1638
01:38:47,340 --> 01:38:48,734
Bye.

1639
01:38:50,776 --> 01:38:52,852
Ooh. Perfect.

1640
01:39:00,986 --> 01:39:03,403
- Do you have a gift box?
- One second.

1641
01:39:07,393 --> 01:39:09,367
Hey.

1642
01:39:13,399 --> 01:39:15,400
<i>Mm.</i>

1643
01:39:15,401 --> 01:39:16,864
- Miss Steele.
- Hmm.

1644
01:39:16,869 --> 01:39:17,992
How was your day?

1645
01:39:18,003 --> 01:39:20,672
Looking up, Mr. Grey.

1646
01:39:20,673 --> 01:39:22,000
Where's Taylor?

1647
01:39:22,007 --> 01:39:24,041
He went to get my bag.

1648
01:39:24,042 --> 01:39:26,511
Your bag? Where are you going?

1649
01:39:26,512 --> 01:39:29,514
Ros and I have to go
to Portland for some meetings.

1650
01:39:29,515 --> 01:39:30,808
I'll be back tomorrow night.

1651
01:39:30,816 --> 01:39:34,018
Hey, come on.

1652
01:39:34,019 --> 01:39:36,588
When were you gonna tell me
about your birthday?

1653
01:39:38,591 --> 01:39:41,593
Your parents are throwing you a party.

1654
01:39:41,594 --> 01:39:44,296
Were we just gonna stay home?

1655
01:39:44,297 --> 01:39:45,760
They do this every year.

1656
01:39:45,764 --> 01:39:48,733
Um, yeah, birthday.

1657
01:39:48,734 --> 01:39:51,669
My, uh, arrival in the world...

1658
01:39:51,670 --> 01:39:54,672
...isn't something
I feel like celebrating.

1659
01:39:54,673 --> 01:39:56,750
Well, I feel like celebrating it.

1660
01:39:58,811 --> 01:40:02,514
Can't open it till the day though.

1661
01:40:02,515 --> 01:40:05,067
Then why give it to me now?

1662
01:40:06,485 --> 01:40:09,454
Call it delayed gratification.

1663
01:41:13,085 --> 01:41:15,086
Is that--

1664
01:41:15,087 --> 01:41:18,122
Is that Mount St. Helens?

1665
01:41:18,123 --> 01:41:21,016
I changed the flight plan,
get us over sooner.

1666
01:41:22,060 --> 01:41:23,729
Great.

1667
01:41:23,729 --> 01:41:25,830
Y.. You realize that's a volcano, right?

1668
01:41:25,831 --> 01:41:27,699
Relax, Ros.

1669
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:29,534
If it goes up,
you'll have a ringside seat.

1670
01:41:29,535 --> 01:41:30,624
Oh.

1671
01:41:30,636 --> 01:41:32,916
Lucky me.

1672
01:41:43,181 --> 01:41:44,916
Ch.. Christian, what is that?

1673
01:41:44,917 --> 01:41:45,903
Don't worry.

1674
01:41:49,988 --> 01:41:52,156
- Oh, my God! Christian!
- Fuck!

1675
01:41:52,157 --> 01:41:53,927
Oh, no, shit.

1676
01:41:58,564 --> 01:42:00,632
Shit. Christian, what is going on?

1677
01:42:00,633 --> 01:42:02,811
- Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
- What is happening?!

1678
01:42:05,604 --> 01:42:07,505
- Damn it.
- Oh, my God.

1679
01:42:07,506 --> 01:42:08,799
Oh, my God, Christian!

1680
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:16,688
Stop it! Oh, no!

1681
01:42:30,195 --> 01:42:32,135
Christian!

1682
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:44,726
There.
There, there, there!

1683
01:43:10,168 --> 01:43:11,837
- Oh, you remember this guy?
- Oh, the one with the--

1684
01:43:11,837 --> 01:43:13,638
- <i>Kate!</i>
- Oh!

1685
01:43:13,639 --> 01:43:16,674
Yes! Oh!

1686
01:43:16,675 --> 01:43:17,696
Hi!

1687
01:43:17,710 --> 01:43:19,944
Oh, my God, you're so tan...

1688
01:43:19,945 --> 01:43:21,545
- ...and glowing.
- Oh, I know.

1689
01:43:21,547 --> 01:43:22,874
You want a beer, Ana?

1690
01:43:22,881 --> 01:43:24,782
Yes! Please, please.

1691
01:43:24,783 --> 01:43:25,872
- Hi, José.
- Hey.

1692
01:43:25,884 --> 01:43:28,119
Hi. How's it going?

1693
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:31,155
So? Congratulations, Fiction Editor.

1694
01:43:31,156 --> 01:43:33,224
Right? She's a big deal now.

1695
01:43:33,225 --> 01:43:35,092
And how's, uh, your hottie?

1696
01:43:35,093 --> 01:43:37,529
Uh, Christian is good.

1697
01:43:37,530 --> 01:43:40,932
Um, uh, he asked me to move in with him.

1698
01:43:40,933 --> 01:43:43,200
What?

1699
01:43:43,201 --> 01:43:44,902
<i>Ana's moving in with Christian.</i>

1700
01:43:44,903 --> 01:43:46,804
<i>Oh, that's great.</i>

1701
01:43:46,805 --> 01:43:49,073
You know, we could use the privacy.

1702
01:43:49,074 --> 01:43:51,308
He's so subtle, it kills me.

1703
01:43:51,309 --> 01:43:53,010
Stop.

1704
01:43:53,011 --> 01:43:54,543
So you're serious.

1705
01:43:54,547 --> 01:43:56,214
But are you happy?

1706
01:43:56,214 --> 01:43:57,848
'Cause that's all I care about.

1707
01:43:57,850 --> 01:44:00,552
I-- Well, I mean,
it's complicated, but I'm--

1708
01:44:00,553 --> 01:44:02,319
- I've never been happier.
- <i>Hey, Mia. What's up?</i>

1709
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:05,056
Did you hear about José's show?

1710
01:44:05,057 --> 01:44:06,758
It was incredible.

1711
01:44:06,759 --> 01:44:08,153
Really. He was amazing.

1712
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:09,994
- He got rave reviews.
- I got to check it out.

1713
01:44:09,995 --> 01:44:12,997
Wait, wait, Mia. Slow down.

1714
01:44:12,998 --> 01:44:16,333
Sh.. Shit. Okay.
Yeah, yeah, we're on our way.

1715
01:44:16,334 --> 01:44:18,235
Um, Christian's chopper went missing...

1716
01:44:18,236 --> 01:44:20,638
...on the way back from Portland.

1717
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:23,641
They're sending out
search parties right now.

1718
01:44:23,642 --> 01:44:25,275
Come on, let's go.

1719
01:44:25,277 --> 01:44:26,978
<i>For more on this breaking story,...</i>

1720
01:44:26,979 --> 01:44:28,034
<i>...let's go out to the field...</i>

1721
01:44:28,046 --> 01:44:29,947
<i>...and our reporter Rachel Taylor.</i>

1722
01:44:29,948 --> 01:44:30,800
Rachel?

1723
01:44:30,816 --> 01:44:32,850
Thank you, John.
I'm speaking to you live...

1724
01:44:32,851 --> 01:44:35,152
...from the private helicopter
terminal at Seattle.

1725
01:44:35,153 --> 01:44:37,154
They'll find him.
He'll be okay.

1726
01:44:37,155 --> 01:44:39,691
It's Christian.

1727
01:44:39,692 --> 01:44:42,694
The helicopter was
an Airbus Helicopters H130...

1728
01:44:42,695 --> 01:44:44,260
<i>Yeah. Is there
anything we can do?</i>

1729
01:44:44,262 --> 01:44:47,364
<i>And Christian Grey,
although only 27 years old,...</i>

1730
01:44:47,365 --> 01:44:48,932
<i>...had extensive flying experience.</i>

1731
01:44:48,934 --> 01:44:49,989
All right, bye.

1732
01:44:50,002 --> 01:44:51,903
<i>One of Seattle's
youngest billionaires,...</i>

1733
01:44:51,904 --> 01:44:55,072
<i>...Grey is the charismatic head
of Grey Enterprises Holdings,...</i>

1734
01:44:55,073 --> 01:44:57,008
<i>...a multinational conglomerate
and nearly...</i>

1735
01:44:57,009 --> 01:44:58,976
<i>...Jesus, will someone shut them up?</i>

1736
01:44:58,977 --> 01:45:00,646
No, please.

1737
01:45:00,646 --> 01:45:01,735
Leave it on.

1738
01:45:01,747 --> 01:45:03,244
Just turn it down please, José.

1739
01:45:03,248 --> 01:45:05,617
Thank you.

1740
01:45:05,618 --> 01:45:08,135
You're shivering.
I'll get you a sweater. Okay.

1741
01:45:14,026 --> 01:45:16,000
Ana. Tea.

1742
01:45:20,733 --> 01:45:23,167
He's gonna be fine.

1743
01:45:23,168 --> 01:45:25,142
He has to be okay.

1744
01:45:27,806 --> 01:45:29,644
We haven't had any time.

1745
01:45:31,677 --> 01:45:33,845
We need to have more time.

1746
01:45:33,846 --> 01:45:37,180
You're going to have plenty of time.

1747
01:45:39,251 --> 01:45:41,753
We are so glad that
you're here with us...

1748
01:45:41,754 --> 01:45:45,056
...and in Christian's life.

1749
01:45:45,057 --> 01:45:48,154
You've made such a difference to him.

1750
01:45:50,095 --> 01:45:53,364
He never let anyone get...

1751
01:45:53,365 --> 01:45:56,258
...close until you came along.

1752
01:45:58,303 --> 01:46:00,972
Grace, he adores you.

1753
01:46:00,973 --> 01:46:03,841
I know, but children grow apart
from their parents,...

1754
01:46:03,842 --> 01:46:08,813
...and that's... that's fine,
as long as they're happy.

1755
01:46:08,814 --> 01:46:14,786
And he is happy with you.

1756
01:46:16,288 --> 01:46:18,856
And that's all I ever wanted.

1757
01:46:18,857 --> 01:46:20,388
<i>Turn it up.</i>

1758
01:46:20,392 --> 01:46:22,026
<i>...that Christian
Grey and his colleague...</i>

1759
01:46:22,027 --> 01:46:24,696
<i>...Ros Bailey have been
found safe and well,...</i>

1760
01:46:24,697 --> 01:46:26,998
<i>...and are at this moment
on their way back to Seattle.</i>

1761
01:46:26,999 --> 01:46:29,033
<i>Sources tell us their helicopter
had to make a--</i>

1762
01:46:29,034 --> 01:46:30,902
<i>What the hell are you all doing here?</i>

1763
01:46:30,903 --> 01:46:33,204
Christian! Oh, my God!

1764
01:46:33,205 --> 01:46:34,972
- Oh, thank God.
- <i>Christian!</i>

1765
01:46:34,973 --> 01:46:36,808
How did you get here?

1766
01:46:36,809 --> 01:46:38,340
<i>Later, Mia.</i>

1767
01:46:38,343 --> 01:46:39,841
<i>What happened? Oh, my God.</i>

1768
01:46:39,845 --> 01:46:41,172
Why didn't you call?

1769
01:46:41,179 --> 01:46:43,114
<i>I.. I had an accident.
I lost my phone.</i>

1770
01:46:43,115 --> 01:46:44,949
<i>We know.
It's been all over the news.</i>

1771
01:46:44,950 --> 01:46:46,918
<i>I'm fine. Ros is fine.</i>

1772
01:46:46,919 --> 01:46:48,853
<i>- Dad. He's here.
- Oh, my God.</i>

1773
01:46:48,854 --> 01:46:50,147
<i>He just walked in.</i>

1774
01:46:50,155 --> 01:46:51,789
- I'm okay.
- <i>I mean, he looks like shit,...</i>

1775
01:46:51,790 --> 01:46:53,185
- <i>...but he's in one piece.</i>
- No, he doesn't.

1776
01:46:53,191 --> 01:46:54,314
- Hey.
- <i>Yeah, he does.</i>

1777
01:46:54,326 --> 01:46:56,127
- <i>Okay. Call you back.</i>
- Guys, relax, I'm fine.

1778
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:58,295
- Okay?
- Come here, man.

1779
01:46:58,296 --> 01:47:00,297
- Need to say hi to my girl.
- Okay.

1780
01:47:00,298 --> 01:47:01,456
<i>Come on, Mom.</i>

1781
01:47:01,466 --> 01:47:04,235
I told you they'd be okay.

1782
01:47:04,236 --> 01:47:05,222
<i>I need a drink.</i>

1783
01:47:05,237 --> 01:47:06,394
<i>Me, too.</i>

1784
01:47:06,404 --> 01:47:08,379
Miss me?

1785
01:47:17,950 --> 01:47:19,924
<i>- Hey, hey, hey.
- Oh, my God.</i>

1786
01:47:22,988 --> 01:47:25,056
- I thought--
- Hey, hey.

1787
01:47:25,057 --> 01:47:27,058
Ana, it's all right.

1788
01:47:27,059 --> 01:47:28,893
Ana, I'm here.

1789
01:47:28,894 --> 01:47:30,895
I was so scared.

1790
01:47:30,896 --> 01:47:33,798
I was so scared.

1791
01:47:33,799 --> 01:47:36,801
Hey.

1792
01:47:36,802 --> 01:47:38,435
I thought I lost you forever.

1793
01:47:38,436 --> 01:47:41,873
Not a chance.

1794
01:47:41,874 --> 01:47:43,031
I'm here.

1795
01:47:47,813 --> 01:47:50,381
That's when all my instruments lit up.

1796
01:47:50,382 --> 01:47:52,483
We had a fire in the tail,
lost both engines.

1797
01:47:52,484 --> 01:47:54,418
Both of them?

1798
01:47:54,419 --> 01:47:55,406
Yeah.

1799
01:47:55,420 --> 01:47:57,554
Thank you.

1800
01:47:57,555 --> 01:48:01,893
I tried to find somewhere safe
to land, but it was all trees.

1801
01:48:01,894 --> 01:48:03,928
We hit 'em pretty hard, but luckily...

1802
01:48:03,929 --> 01:48:06,397
...we were both
able to crawl out of there.

1803
01:48:06,398 --> 01:48:08,440
Thank goodness.

1804
01:48:09,501 --> 01:48:13,337
Thank God.

1805
01:48:13,338 --> 01:48:16,407
Sorry, guys, but I got to take off.

1806
01:48:16,408 --> 01:48:18,409
<i>Okay.</i>

1807
01:48:18,410 --> 01:48:21,478
José, thanks for being here.

1808
01:48:21,479 --> 01:48:22,875
Means the world to Ana.

1809
01:48:22,881 --> 01:48:24,243
Of course.

1810
01:48:24,249 --> 01:48:27,051
Hey, welcome home, Mr. Grey.

1811
01:48:27,052 --> 01:48:29,420
Christian, please.

1812
01:48:29,421 --> 01:48:30,816
Well, it's late...

1813
01:48:30,823 --> 01:48:32,286
...and these two should get some rest.

1814
01:48:32,290 --> 01:48:33,277
<i>Yes.</i>

1815
01:48:33,291 --> 01:48:34,925
Grace, shall we?

1816
01:48:34,927 --> 01:48:36,894
Yeah, I think we're going
to head home, too, bro.

1817
01:48:36,895 --> 01:48:38,018
<i>Cool.</i>

1818
01:48:38,030 --> 01:48:40,564
We'll walk you guys.

1819
01:48:40,565 --> 01:48:43,000
Kind of hate to say this,...

1820
01:48:43,001 --> 01:48:45,069
...but your guy's all right.

1821
01:48:45,070 --> 01:48:46,904
I'm glad he's okay...

1822
01:48:46,905 --> 01:48:48,504
...and I'm glad you're happy.

1823
01:48:48,506 --> 01:48:50,106
Thank you.

1824
01:48:50,108 --> 01:48:52,009
Will we be seeing you
tomorrow at his party?

1825
01:48:52,010 --> 01:48:52,997
Don't push it.

1826
01:48:57,615 --> 01:49:00,584
Come here. Mm.

1827
01:49:00,585 --> 01:49:02,185
<i>I'm okay, Mom.</i>

1828
01:49:02,187 --> 01:49:04,055
I know.

1829
01:49:04,056 --> 01:49:06,030
- <i>Mom.</i>
- Okay.

1830
01:49:08,226 --> 01:49:09,553
We'll see you tomorrow, Ana.

1831
01:49:09,561 --> 01:49:11,535
<i>Yeah, good night.</i>

1832
01:49:17,369 --> 01:49:19,070
It's after midnight.

1833
01:49:19,071 --> 01:49:21,873
I'm not tired.

1834
01:49:21,874 --> 01:49:23,405
No.

1835
01:49:23,408 --> 01:49:25,008
It's your birthday.

1836
01:49:27,445 --> 01:49:29,881
Yeah.

1837
01:49:29,882 --> 01:49:33,250
Happy birthday.

1838
01:49:33,251 --> 01:49:35,226
Thank you.

1839
01:49:37,422 --> 01:49:39,975
Do you still have that gift I gave you?

1840
01:49:54,606 --> 01:49:57,474
You know you didn't have to.

1841
01:49:57,475 --> 01:49:59,042
All I want is you.

1842
01:49:59,044 --> 01:50:00,609
Just open it.

1843
01:50:00,612 --> 01:50:02,144
Okay.

1844
01:50:08,486 --> 01:50:10,287
Key chain.

1845
01:50:10,288 --> 01:50:12,059
Turn it over.

1846
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,135
Does this mean yes, yes?

1847
01:50:24,136 --> 01:50:26,070
Yes.

1848
01:50:26,071 --> 01:50:28,453
Yes, yes, yes.

1849
01:50:34,379 --> 01:50:36,113
Wait.

1850
01:50:36,114 --> 01:50:39,041
So this whole time,
I had the answer in my pocket?

1851
01:50:42,054 --> 01:50:45,592
Anastasia Steele,
what am I gonna do with you?

1852
01:51:18,090 --> 01:51:20,157
Take me to the Red Room.

1853
01:51:20,158 --> 01:51:21,179
Take me.

1854
01:51:21,193 --> 01:51:23,427
Take me to the Red Room.

1855
01:51:23,428 --> 01:51:25,662
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1856
01:51:25,663 --> 01:51:28,199

Well, I love you.

1891
01:54:13,931 --> 01:54:15,463
<i>Hello.</i>

1892
01:54:15,467 --> 01:54:17,601
- Mom?
- Hi.

1893
01:54:17,602 --> 01:54:21,572
Ana, sweetheart, where have you been?

1894
01:54:21,573 --> 01:54:24,341
I know, I've been--
I.. I'm sorry.

1895
01:54:24,342 --> 01:54:26,643
Work has been so crazy.

1896
01:54:26,644 --> 01:54:28,745
I hope they're not overworking you.

1897
01:54:28,746 --> 01:54:33,250
No, no, it's actually--
It's going really well.

1898
01:54:33,251 --> 01:54:35,352
Um, but I was calling because I, um,...

1899
01:54:35,353 --> 01:54:38,689
...I wanted to talk to you
about Christian.

1900
01:54:38,690 --> 01:54:40,256
Christian?

1901
01:54:40,258 --> 01:54:41,551
You've heard from him?

1902
01:54:41,559 --> 01:54:44,795
Yeah, we got back together.

1903
01:54:44,796 --> 01:54:46,191
Honey.

1904
01:54:46,198 --> 01:54:48,732
That's wonderful.

1905
01:54:48,733 --> 01:54:50,299
This time it's going to last.

1906
01:54:50,302 --> 01:54:51,561
I know it is.

1907
01:54:51,569 --> 01:54:54,571
I hope you're right because,...

1908
01:54:54,572 --> 01:54:58,775
...um... he asked me to marry him,...

1909
01:54:58,776 --> 01:55:00,751
...and I said yes.

1910
01:55:05,583 --> 01:55:07,584
Mom?

1911
01:55:07,585 --> 01:55:09,586
You're not-- ?

1912
01:55:09,587 --> 01:55:11,588
No, no, I'm not pregnant.

1913
01:55:11,589 --> 01:55:14,891
Um--

1914
01:55:14,892 --> 01:55:17,761
I know that we haven't been
together very long,...

1915
01:55:17,762 --> 01:55:20,597
...but--

1916
01:55:20,598 --> 01:55:23,594
But I just--
I love him so much.

1917
01:55:26,238 --> 01:55:28,239
He's the one.

1918
01:55:28,240 --> 01:55:29,838
Oh, sweetheart.

1919
01:55:29,841 --> 01:55:31,842
I'm so happy for you.

1920
01:55:31,843 --> 01:55:33,944
- You are?
- Of course.

1921
01:55:33,945 --> 01:55:36,580
You've always known your own mind.

1922
01:55:36,581 --> 01:55:38,782
If that man is the love of your life,...

1923
01:55:38,783 --> 01:55:41,652
...you grab him with both hands.

1924
01:55:41,653 --> 01:55:44,255
Thanks, Mama.

1925
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:45,583
Have you called Ray?

1926
01:55:45,590 --> 01:55:47,791
Um, no, not yet.

1927
01:55:47,792 --> 01:55:49,926
Um, Christian did, though.

1928
01:55:49,927 --> 01:55:52,263
He asked for his permission.

1929
01:55:52,264 --> 01:55:54,431
He asked for your hand?

1930
01:55:54,432 --> 01:55:56,700
That's so chivalrous.

1931
01:56:17,589 --> 01:56:19,740
I don't think she's
gotten one of these.

1932
01:56:19,741 --> 01:56:20,457
<i>Cheers.</i>

1933
01:56:21,759 --> 01:56:22,713
Hey.

1934
01:56:23,761 --> 01:56:24,782
Hey.

1935
01:56:24,796 --> 01:56:26,395
Champagne, Mr. Grey?

1936
01:56:26,398 --> 01:56:27,555
Thanks, Gretchen.

1937
01:56:27,565 --> 01:56:30,834
And can I just say happy birthday?

1938
01:56:30,835 --> 01:56:32,945
Sure. Thank you.

1939
01:56:35,873 --> 01:56:38,074
- Christian.
- Mom.

1940
01:56:38,075 --> 01:56:40,377
- Oh. Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

1941
01:56:40,378 --> 01:56:42,713
- Mmm. And Ana.
- Hi.

1942
01:56:42,714 --> 01:56:44,815
It's so good to see you again.

1943
01:56:44,816 --> 01:56:47,384
You saw us last night.

1944
01:56:47,385 --> 01:56:49,620
Yes. And because of that,...

1945
01:56:49,621 --> 01:56:53,757
...I am never taking anything
for granted, ever again.

1946
01:56:53,758 --> 01:56:55,358
<i>Hey.</i>

1947
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:57,328
I heard about the crash.
Are you okay?

1948
01:56:57,329 --> 01:56:59,563
- I'm fine, Elena. Thank you.
- Oh!

1949
01:57:00,798 --> 01:57:04,401
Ana, let me introduce to you
my good friend Elena Lincoln.

1950
01:57:04,402 --> 01:57:06,570
Uh, we met at the masquerade.

1951
01:57:06,571 --> 01:57:07,558
Yes.

1952
01:57:07,572 --> 01:57:08,797
Nice to see you again.

1953
01:57:11,008 --> 01:57:12,438
<i>Excuse us.</i>

1954
01:57:12,444 --> 01:57:14,009
Surely.

1955
01:57:14,011 --> 01:57:15,407
She's fantastic.

1956
01:57:22,854 --> 01:57:25,522
Ladies, gentlemen, Mia.

1957
01:57:27,792 --> 01:57:30,761
I want to thank you all
for coming here this evening.

1958
01:57:30,762 --> 01:57:32,529
I was expecting
a small family gathering.

1959
01:57:32,530 --> 01:57:33,994
Thanks, Mia.

1960
01:57:33,998 --> 01:57:35,832
Uh, but I'm happy
that you're all here,...

1961
01:57:35,833 --> 01:57:38,969
...because I have
an announcement to make.

1962
01:57:38,970 --> 01:57:43,054
As most of you know, yesterday
Ros and I had a narrow escape.

1963
01:57:44,942 --> 01:57:48,745
And something like that reminds
us of what really matters...

1964
01:57:48,746 --> 01:57:52,015
...and how important it is
to seize the day.

1965
01:57:52,016 --> 01:57:53,784
We should cherish
the people we care about...

1966
01:57:53,785 --> 01:57:56,387
...and-- and who care about us.

1967
01:57:56,388 --> 01:57:58,755
Mom, Dad,...

1968
01:57:58,756 --> 01:58:03,427
...I know I haven't always
been the perfect son,...

1969
01:58:03,428 --> 01:58:07,097
...but I owe everything
to you both, so thank you.

1970
01:58:09,567 --> 01:58:11,735
<i>Hear, hear.</i>

1971
01:58:11,736 --> 01:58:13,804
Oh, here.

1972
01:58:13,805 --> 01:58:15,839
But that's not the announcement.

1973
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:18,903
Ana, come up here a second, please.

1974
01:58:29,053 --> 01:58:31,054
So a while ago, I was lucky enough...

1975
01:58:31,055 --> 01:58:34,825
...to meet this amazing
young woman, Anastasia Steele.

1976
01:58:34,826 --> 01:58:37,193
And very quickly, I realized
that she was the one...

1977
01:58:37,194 --> 01:58:39,930
...I wanted to share my life with.

1978
01:58:39,931 --> 01:58:42,533
So I asked her to marry me.

1979
01:58:42,534 --> 01:58:43,963
And she said yes.

1980
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:47,170
Oh, that is so--

1981
01:58:58,015 --> 01:59:00,984
- I'm thrilled, Ana.
- Come here, bro.

1982
01:59:00,985 --> 01:59:02,853
- Welcome to the family.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

1983
01:59:02,854 --> 01:59:06,490
<i>And if I cry any more,
I'm just going to dehydrate.</i>

1984
01:59:06,491 --> 01:59:07,920
- Welcome.
- Oh, my God, don't do that.

1985
01:59:07,925 --> 01:59:09,014
Congratulations.

1986
01:59:09,026 --> 01:59:10,524
Stop crying, Mom.

1987
01:59:10,528 --> 01:59:11,719
Can't help it.

1988
01:59:11,729 --> 01:59:13,864
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

1989
01:59:13,865 --> 01:59:17,534
Well done, big brother.

1990
01:59:17,535 --> 01:59:20,103
Ring. Show me the ring.

1991
01:59:20,104 --> 01:59:21,905
Oh, we're gonna choose it together.

1992
01:59:21,906 --> 01:59:23,199
No rock.

1993
01:59:23,207 --> 01:59:24,975
Christian Grey.

1994
01:59:24,976 --> 01:59:26,977
Oh, my God, I have a sister!

1995
01:59:26,978 --> 01:59:29,012
Ana!

1996
01:59:29,013 --> 01:59:30,947
<i>Thanks, Jim.</i>

1997
01:59:30,948 --> 01:59:32,923
Grace and I are so proud.

1998
01:59:39,891 --> 01:59:42,593
I leave you alone for a couple
weeks and this is what happens?

1999
01:59:42,594 --> 01:59:43,853
I know. I'm--

2000
01:59:43,861 --> 01:59:45,862
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
- Oh, please.

2001
01:59:45,863 --> 01:59:47,225
- Come here.
- Oh.

2002
01:59:47,231 --> 01:59:49,666
Mm.

2003
01:59:49,667 --> 01:59:52,002
So, how does it feel to bag...

2004
01:59:52,003 --> 01:59:53,535
...Seattle's most eligible bachelor?

2005
01:59:53,538 --> 01:59:55,506
It's a little scary, but--

2006
01:59:55,507 --> 01:59:58,041
Well, if anyone can make
it work, it's you.

2007
01:59:58,042 --> 02:00:00,677
Hey, sis-in-law.

2008
02:00:00,678 --> 02:00:02,005
Congratulations.

2009
02:00:02,013 --> 02:00:03,847
Christian's a very lucky guy.

2010
02:00:04,716 --> 02:00:07,283
You, however, are certifiably insane.

2011
02:00:07,284 --> 02:00:09,219
Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt.

2012
02:00:09,220 --> 02:00:11,522
Uh, Mia wants to taste
one of your killer cocktails.

2013
02:00:11,523 --> 02:00:12,713
Oh, well, coming right up.

2014
02:00:15,092 --> 02:00:18,564
I see you heeded our little talk.

2015
02:00:23,067 --> 02:00:25,802
What makes you think
I would ever listen to you?

2016
02:00:25,803 --> 02:00:27,871
You don't care about Christian.

2017
02:00:27,872 --> 02:00:29,233
He'll see that.

2018
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:30,806
I'll make sure of it.

2019
02:00:30,808 --> 02:00:33,844
He'll see right through you.

2020
02:00:33,845 --> 02:00:35,879
It's over for you, Elena.

2021
02:00:35,880 --> 02:00:39,115
You're just a mousy
little thing after his money.

2022
02:00:39,116 --> 02:00:41,635
He's not capable of marriage.

2023
02:00:48,325 --> 02:00:50,060
Thank you, Christian.

2024
02:00:50,061 --> 02:00:53,096
<i>Why are you even here, Elena?</i>

2025
02:00:53,097 --> 02:00:54,697
She's not right for you.

2026
02:00:54,699 --> 02:00:56,667
You don't know what's right for me.

2027
02:00:56,668 --> 02:00:58,802
You taught me how to fuck, Elena.

2028
02:00:58,803 --> 02:01:00,571
Ana taught me how to love.

2029
02:01:00,572 --> 02:01:03,139
She's just the next one in line.

2030
02:01:03,140 --> 02:01:05,013
Get out of my house.

2031
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:10,947
Leave my children alone...

2032
02:01:10,948 --> 02:01:13,160
...and get the hell out of my house.

2033
02:01:26,130 --> 02:01:28,999
Ana, darling...

2034
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:32,641
...would you give us
a moment alone, please?

2035
02:02:01,999 --> 02:02:03,190
I'm sorry about that.

2036
02:02:07,271 --> 02:02:08,769
Is your mom okay?

2037
02:02:10,007 --> 02:02:12,643
- Furious.
- Hmm.

2038
02:02:12,644 --> 02:02:14,140
Elena's gone.

2039
02:02:14,145 --> 02:02:16,346
Like gone, gone?

2040
02:02:16,347 --> 02:02:17,742
I'm done.

2041
02:02:17,749 --> 02:02:20,216
The business, everything.

2042
02:02:20,217 --> 02:02:22,805
I'll have my people sort out
the details tomorrow.

2043
02:02:24,856 --> 02:02:27,290
I know she was important to you.

2044
02:02:27,291 --> 02:02:29,993
I'm sorry.

2045
02:02:29,994 --> 02:02:32,162
Are you?

2046
02:02:32,163 --> 02:02:33,422
- No.
- No.

2047
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:38,276
What's that you got there?

2048
02:02:53,084 --> 02:02:54,445
Come with me.

2049
02:02:54,451 --> 02:02:59,022
There's something I need to show you.

2050
02:02:59,023 --> 02:03:00,691
<i>Last time we came down here,...</i>

2051
02:03:00,692 --> 02:03:01,951
<i>...I was over your shoulder.</i>

2052
02:03:01,959 --> 02:03:03,934
Oh, yeah.

2053
02:03:21,278 --> 02:03:23,253
After you.

2054
02:03:34,191 --> 02:03:35,860
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

2055
02:03:37,394 --> 02:03:39,429
You wanted hearts and flowers.

2056
02:03:39,430 --> 02:03:41,431
- Oh, my God!
- It's okay.

2057
02:03:41,432 --> 02:03:42,794
It's okay.

2058
02:03:49,340 --> 02:03:51,314
Christian.

2059
02:03:53,377 --> 02:03:55,351
This is amazing.

2060
02:04:02,386 --> 02:04:05,088
Be mine.

2061
02:04:05,089 --> 02:04:07,165
Share my life with me.

2062
02:04:08,993 --> 02:04:10,184
Yes.

2063
02:04:10,194 --> 02:04:12,883
Marry me.

2064
02:04:15,266 --> 02:04:17,033
I'll marry you.

2065
02:04:17,034 --> 02:04:19,519
Give me your hand.

2066
02:04:33,985 --> 02:04:35,379
Did you do that?

2067
02:04:40,257 --> 02:04:41,517
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

2068
02:04:46,563 --> 02:04:48,028
It's beautiful.

2069
02:04:48,032 --> 02:04:49,900
Ah!

2070
02:04:49,901 --> 02:04:52,202
- It's great, isn't it?
- Oh, that's so pretty.

2071
02:04:52,203 --> 02:04:53,973
- Mm.
