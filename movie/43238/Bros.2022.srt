00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,220
嘿，各位，我是鲍比·莱伯，
Hey, everyone, it's Bobby Leiber,

2
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,090
欢迎来到你们最喜欢的播客节目，
and welcome to your favorite podcast,

3
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,930
《石墙的第11块砖》。
The 11th Brick at Stonewall.

4
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,600
因为我们都知道很可能是一个阳刚的拉拉
Because we all know a butch lesbian

5
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,930
或者是一个有色人种的变性女人
or a trans woman of color

6
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,870
向石墙扔了第一块砖，
probably threw the first brick at Stonewall,

7
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,000
但投出第11块砖头的是一名顺性的白人男同性恋。
but it was a cis, white, gay man who threw the 11th brick.

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,770
今天，我将一如既往地带你们踏上一段旅程
And today, as always, I will take you on a journey

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,810
纵观LGBTQ+的历史，更重要的是，
throughout LGBTQ+ history and, much more importantly,

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,580
谈论我自己的问题和我想谈论的任何事情。
my own problems and whatever I feel like talking about.

11
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,680
今天是个大日子，因为从今天起，
And this is a big day, because, as of today,

12
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,820
《第11块砖》正在庆祝喜获100万订户。
The 11th Brick is celebrating one million subscribers.

13
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,790
为了纪念这些激动人心的消息，
And in honor of all this exciting news,

14
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,990
我将会现场回答你们的问题。
I am taking your questions live.

15
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,790
你还会写更多的儿童读物吗？
Any chance for more children's books?

16
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,660
噢，现在不会，不过谢谢你。
Oh, not at the moment, but thank you.

17
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,800
正如你们中的一些人所知道的，我写了一个系列的儿童读物
As some of you know, I wrote a series of children's books

18
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,270
来帮助父母教孩子们同性恋史，
to help parents teach kids about gay history,

19
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,800
但没人买。
which no one bought.

20
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,100
原来一个四岁的孩子不想听
Turns out a four-year-old didn't want to hear

21
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,340
关于玛蒂娜·纳夫拉蒂洛娃的睡前故事。
a bedtime story about Martina Navratilova.

22
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,370
嘿，父母们，谢谢你们跟孩子们讲
Hey, parents, thanks for teaching your kids about

23
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,770
圣诞老人的故事，一个并不存在的直男，
Santa Claus, a straight man that doesn't exist,

24
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,740
而不是玛蒂娜·纳夫拉蒂洛娃，一位真实存在的女同性恋。
and not Martina Navratilova, a lesbian who does.

25
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,680
其他消息的话，我终于拿到了我的试镜的录影
In other news, I finally got the footage from my audition

26
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,680
是为下一部《粉雄救兵》一个卡司的试镜，
to be part of the next cast of Queer Eye,

27
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,680
你们现在就可以在这款应用上观看。
and you can watch that on the app right now.

28
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,990
-哦，不.-哦，我的.
-Oh, no. -Oh, my...

29
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,400
抱歉，这不是一个悲伤的场景。
I'm sorry. This is not sad.

30
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,930
这并不令人难过。
It's just not sad.

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,030
你给他理了个发和一条裤子。
You gave him a haircut and a pair of pants.

32
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,370
我是说，他看起来还行。
I mean, he looks fine.

33
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,170
-不太好。-下一位来电者。
-Not great. -Next caller.

34
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,110
你写的那部电影后来怎么样了？
What ever happened to that movie you wrote?

35
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,640
哦，对了，那部电影。
Oh, yeah. The movie.

36
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,140
那些大型电影的制片人来找我说，
These big movie producers came to me and said,

37
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,980
“我们想让你写一部关于一对同性恋情侣的浪漫喜剧。”
"We want you to write a rom-com about a gay couple.”

38
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,810
“一些全世界都会喜欢看的东西。”
"Something the whole world would enjoy.”

39
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,380
“一些甚至连直男都可能会喜欢
"Something that a straight guy might even like

40
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,150
和他们的女朋友一起看的东西。”我说，
and watch with his girlfriend." I said,

41
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,820
“一些直男可能会喜欢的东西？比如像是什么？”
"Something a straight guy might like? Like what exactly?”

42
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,750
“我是不是要在一场高速追逐中
"Am I gonna be in the middle of some high-speed chase

43
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,820
突然爱上了Ice Cube ？”
"and then all of a sudden fall in love with Ice Cube?”

44
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,960
“我是不是还要被Jason Momoa猛操一顿，
"Am I gonna get butt-fucked by Jason Momoa

45
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,230
而同时我们还都在，我不知道，在担心一座火山会爆发？”
while we're both, I don't know, worrying about a volcano?”

46
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,800
然后他说：“鲍比，我们只是想拍一部
And he said, "Bobby, we just want to make a movie

47
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,700
向世界展示了同性恋和异性恋关系
that shows the world gay and straight relationships

48
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,800
都是一样的的电影。”
are the same.”

49
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,840
“爱就是爱就是爱。
“Love is love is love."

50
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,670
我说：“爱就是爱就是爱？”
I said, "Love is love is love?”

51
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,170
“不，才不是，那是胡扯。”
"No, it's not. That's bullshit.”

52
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,770
“这是一个我们不得不编造的来说服你们这些白痴
"That is a lie we had to make up to convince you idiots

53
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,410
终于公正地对待我们的谎言。”
"to finally treat us fairly.”

54
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,910
“爱才不是爱。”
"Love is not love.”

55
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,010
“我们的关系是不同的。”
"Our relationships are different.”

56
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,850
“我们的性生活是不同的。”
“Our sex lives are different."

57
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,420
然后他说：“鲍比，我们只是想制作
And he said, "Bobby, we were just trying to make

58
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,890
一部关于善良的好同性恋者的好电影。”
a nice movie about nice gay people."

59
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,360
然后我说：“嗯，这是你的第一个错误，
And I said, "Well, there's your first mistake,

60
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,090
因为并不是所有的同性恋都是好人。”
because not all gay people are nice."

61
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,290
然后我就起身走人了。
And I got up and left.

62
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,860
不管怎么说，这完全没问题。
Anyway, it's totally fine.

63
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,360
我反正都不太适合写浪漫的喜剧。
I'm not the right person to write a rom-com anyway.

64
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,330
为什么不适合？
Why not?

65
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,960
呃，我不知道。
Um, I don't know.

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,900
我是说，我都40岁了。我从来没有谈过恋爱。
I mean, I'm 40 years old. I've never been in love.

67
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,440
我甚至从来没有过一段认真的关系。这其实也还好，
I've never even had a serious relationship, which is fine.

68
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,240
你知道吧，我热爱我的生活，我热爱我的自由。
You know, I love my life. I love my freedom.

69
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,110
我喜欢我的独立，但是，你知道，
I love my independence, but, you know,

70
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,710
可能意味着我不太适合
probably means I'm not the right person

71
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,050
写一部爱情故事。
to write a love story.

72
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,910
令人兴奋的消息是，我仍然非常饥渴，
In exciting news, I remain very horny,

73
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,850
而且今晚，我将在LGBTQ+骄傲颁奖典礼上获奖。
and tonight I am being honored at the LGBTQ+ Pride Awards.

74
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,060
作为美国国家橄榄球联盟的一员，我从未想过我能出柜。
Being in the NFL, I never thought I could come out.

75
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,300
多年来，我不得不为作为一个性感、丰满的同性恋者，
For years, I had to suffer as a hot, ripped, gay person,

76
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,860
但又要过着隐秘的生活而饱受折磨。
living my life in private.

77
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,300
但去年的这一年真的让我看到
But this last year has really shown me

78
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:29,210
当你终于在公众面前炙手可热的时候，你的生活有多么美妙。
how amazing life can be when you are finally publicly hot.

79
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,080
谢谢。
Thank you.

80
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,180
现在，请欢迎
And now, please welcome

00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,210
艾美奖和托尼奖得主克里斯汀·切诺维斯。
Emmy and Tony Award winner Kristin Chenoweth.

82
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,810
晚上好。
Good evening.

83
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,220
今晚能来到这里是我的荣幸。
What an honor for me to be here tonight.

84
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,260
我头上戴着一顶描绘石墙骚乱的帽子，
On my head is a hat depicting the Stonewall riots,

85
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,960
这是酷儿解放运动开始的地方。
where the queer liberation movement began.

86
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:53,000
现在，年度顺性白人男同性恋者奖。
And now, the award for cis, white, gay man of the year.

87
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,830
请欢迎鲍比·莱伯。
Please welcome Bobby Leiber.

88
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,370
谢谢。
Thank you.

89
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,500
噢，我的天。
Oh, my goodness.

90
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,170
谢谢你，纽约！谢谢!
Thank you, New York! Thank you!

91
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,810
谢谢。
Thank you.

92
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,380
了解一下库马姆霍特普和尼安赫赫纳姆，
Meet Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum,

93
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,550
古埃及的伯特和厄尼。
the Bert and Ernie of Ancient Egypt.

94
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,180
许多学者认为，他们是
Many scholars believe that they are

95
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,450
有史记载的第一对同性伴侣。
the first recorded same-sex couple in history.

96
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,190
然而直到今天，仍有历史学家
Yet to this day, there are historians

97
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,020
拒绝相信这些人是恋人
who refuse to believe that these men were lovers

98
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,230
并且坚称他们是兄弟。
and insist that they were brothers instead.

99
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,530
因此5000年的酷儿爱情故事就这样
Thus began 5,000 years of queer love stories

100
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,130
从历史书中被抹去了。
erased from the history books.

101
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,500
从来就没有可以教给我们关于爱
No gay love stories to teach us about love

102
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,070
以及如何彼此相爱的同性爱情故事。
and how to love each other.

103
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,010
然而，我很高兴地说，这场文化抹除将会在今天终结。
Well, I'm happy to say this erasure ends today.

104
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,970
我很高兴地宣布，我已经接受了一个职位
And I am thrilled to announce I have accepted a position

非常感谢你们。

Thank you.

你想做完吗？
You want to finish?

120
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,190
呃，没事，就这样吧。
Uh, I think I'm good, actually.

121
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,450
-行，我去给你拿点东西来擦干净.   -好
-Okay, I'll get you something for that. -Yeah.

122
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,590
谢谢。

对我来说，冰冷尴尬的
For me, the cold and awkward

Grindr 约炮之后通常是

独自一人在城市里散步。

还有其他人这么做吗？

这很奇怪，因为你还有，

你还是会有那种感觉
you're still feeling this kind of

134
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,690
那种性爱后的温暖和眷念。
post-sex warmth and wistfulness.

135
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,960
所以我通常会四处走走
So I usually walk around for a bit

136
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,960
我就像是怀着那种温暖的感觉在走着
and I kind of coast on that warm feeling

137
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,590
直到它消失。
as long as it lasts.

138
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,000
在和你不喜欢的陌生人的怪异的性爱
And between the weird sex with strangers that you don't like

139
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,130
与你所爱的但又
and conversations with friends you love

140
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,070
永远不会一起上床的朋友之间的交谈中，你知道吧，
that you would never have sex with, you know,

141
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:24,710
你能够拼凑出一种浪漫的单身生活。
you cobble together a version of a romantic single life.

142
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,310
而这挺好的，你知道吧？
And it's good, you know?

143
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,580
它对你有用。
It works.

144
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,280
这已经比
It's a lot more than

145
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,350
这个世界上很多人所拥有的要多得多了。
what a lot of other people have in this world.

146
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,490
你要努力记住这一点。
And you try to remember that.

好吧，这是怎么回事？我错过了什么？
All right, what's going on? What did I miss?

153
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,200
你们好吗，卢卡斯？
How are you guys, Lucas?

154
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,670
呃，好吧，我们的代孕妈妈

I'm sorry, you guys. I have to go.

00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,120
在酒吧上的晚班。
A late shift at the bar.

00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,550
但很高兴见到你们。
But it was great meeting you guys.

-See you later. Text us. -Bye, y'all.

164
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,190
等等，这是怎么回事？
Wait, so what's happening?

165
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,620
你们不是有个公告吗？
Didn't you guys have an announcement?

166
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,760
好吧，呃，我完全知道这有点奇怪
Okay, uh, so, I totally know this is a little weird

167
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,360
令人意想不到，但我们之所以
and unexpected, but the reason we've been

168
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,670
和马蒂在一起这么久是不是
hanging around with Marty so much is that

169
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,770
我们差不多是在和他约会。
we are kind of dating him.

170
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,770
-哦-好的.
-Oh. -Okay.

171
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,210
等一下。
Wait a second.

172
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,770
等等，等等，等等。
Wait, wait, wait.

173
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,310
你在和他约会是什么意思？
What do you mean you're dating him?

174
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,480
我是说，在一起，就像是一对情侣。
I mean, together, like, as a couple.

175
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,810
我们要见他了。
We're seeing him.

176
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,780
我想这有点像是一种复杂的情况。
I guess it's kind of like a throuple situation.

177
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,380
等一等。
Hold on.

178
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,490
等等，这到底是什么意思？
So, wait, what does that mean exactly?

179
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,050
就像，你们只是在玩三人行还是怎么的？
Like, are you guys just having threesomes or something?

180
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,290
嗯，我们勾搭上了，但后来我们开始花钱
Well, we hooked up, but then we started spending

181
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,830
之后在一起的一大堆时间。
a bunch of time together after.

182
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,630
事实证明，我们有很多共同点。
It turns out we have a lot in common.

183
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,660
这不仅仅是性爱。我们真心喜欢对方。
It's more than just sex. We genuinely like each other.

184
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,060
--等等，等等。那么，这种情况已经持续了多久了？
--Wait, wait. So, how long has this been going on?

185
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,400
-六个月？-哦
-Six months? -Oh.

186
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,100
六个月--你有六个月的时间
Six mon-- You're in a throuple for six months

187
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,300
而你却没有告诉我？
and you didn't tell me?

188
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,140
我们不知道事情会变得这么严重。
We didn't know it'd get that serious.

189
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,710
这段关系能认真到哪去？你是在一段三人行中欸。
How serious is it gonna get? You're in a throuple.

190
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,710
你下一步打算做什么，告诉你的祖父母吗？
What are you gonna do next, tell your grandparents?

191
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,140
嗨，奶奶。
Hi, Grandma.

192
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,640
哦，嗨，亲爱的。
Oh, hi, honey.

193
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,250
-我有一些消息.-什么事？
-I have some news. -Yes?

194
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,350
彼得和我在和第三个人上床！
Peter and I are jointly fucking a third person!

195
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,450
哦，我的天哪！
Oh, my goodness!

196
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,290
我是保罗。
It's Paul.

197
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,720
他和彼得在一起和别人上床！
He and Peter are jointly fucking someone else!

198
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,720
哦，太棒了。这是一段三人行。
Oh, how wonderful. It's a throuple.

199
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,190
噢。
Oh.

200
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,530
我们会没事的。
We'll be fine.

201
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,560
我们真的足够信任对方来做这件事。
We really trust each other enough to do this.

202
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,730
小心点就好。
Just be careful.

203
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,770
我认识很多人都这么做过，
I know a lot of guys who've done this,

204
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,300
而且这是一段下坡路。
and it's a slippery slope.

205
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,570
这些关系是脆弱的，而且，你知道，我们是男人。
These things are fragile, and, you know, we're men.

206
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,440
好吧?男人和男人约会。爱不是爱。
Okay? Men dating men. Love is not love.

207
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,240
我们好色、自私、愚蠢。我也是。
We are horny and selfish and stupid. I am, too.

208
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,410
是啊，前几天有人打电话到我的节目里问我
Yeah, someone called into my show the other day and asked me

209
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,440
为什么我还是单身。我说：“你想知道为什么吗？
why I'm still single. I said, "You want to know why?

210
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,180
“因为我一辈子都是同性恋，
"Because I've been gay my whole life,

211
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,180
我也不相信这些同性恋混蛋。“
and I don't trust these gay motherfuckers."

212
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,180
我支持他们，但我不信任他们。
I support them, but I don't trust them.

213
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,720
-你开心吗？-谁总是这么开心？
-And are you happy? -Who's so happy all the time?

214
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,190
呃，很多人。
Uh, a lot of people.

215
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,760
嗯，我真的不信任那些人。
Well, I really don't trust those people.

216
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,190
莱伯先生？
Mr. Leiber?

217
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,490
抱歉的。我喜欢你的播客。
Sorry. I love your podcast.

218
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,760
我能拍张自拍吗-当然可以
-Can I, can I get a selfie? -Oh, sure.

219
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,730
谢谢。
Thank you.

220
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,300
-嗯-嗯.-见鬼.
-Mm-hmm. - Shit.

221
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,200
我告诉亨利我会在这个发布会上见他。
I told Henry I'd meet him at this launch party.

222
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,640
呃，我想先回家换衣服。
Ugh, I wanted to go home and change first.

223
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,870
你们就不能脱掉上衣吗？
Aren't you guys just gonna take your shirts off anyway?

224
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,210
不，我们不会脱掉衬衫的。
No, we're not just gonna take our shirts off.

225
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,710
现在不是2003年。
It's not 2003.

226
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,480
你对男同性恋者在派对上的所作所为有着非常陈词滥调的看法。
You have a very clichéd view of what gay men do at a party.

227
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,250
♪我们一起舞动..。♪
♪ We all move together... ♪

228
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,220
这个应用程序是用来做什么的？
What app is this for again?

229
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,760
这是我公司推出的一款新的勾搭应用程序。
It's this new hookup app my company is launching.

230
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,590
我们找到了Grindr。我们有Tinder了。
We've got Grindr. We've got Tinder.

231
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,260
这是齐薇格。
This is Zellweger.

232
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,860
这是为那些只想谈论女演员的男同性恋准备的
It's for gay guys who just want to talk about actresses

233
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,830
-那就去睡觉吧.-哦，我会用这个的.
-then go to bed. -Oh, I'd use that.

234
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,640
鲍比，我和一个65岁的人上床了。
Bobby, I had sex with a 65-year-old.

235
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,240
六十五?
Sixty-five?

236
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,240
他的个人资料上没有年龄。
He didn't have an age on his profile.

237
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,910
他真的很好，他的身材很棒，
He was really nice, he had an amazing body,

238
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,740
但他有一把大白胡子。
but he had this, like, big, white beard.

239
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,510
我觉得自己就像圣诞老人夫人。
I felt like Mrs. Claus.

240
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,250
我还挺喜欢的。
I kind of love that.

241

Oh, yeah, I don't know who that is.

247
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,660
他有时会去健身房。
He's at the gym sometimes.

248
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,830
非常火辣。非常无聊。
Very hot. Very boring.

-Oh, what else is new? -Oh.

Also, today I had sex with a guy who peed on me.

251
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,270
哦，你喜欢那个吗？
Oh, are you into that?

252
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,640
不是真的，但我还做了什么？
Not really, but what else was I doing?

253
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,710
当然可以。
Fair enough.

254
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,280
老实说，这有点无聊。
It was honestly kind of boring.

255
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,610
嘿，怎么了？
Hey, what's up?

256
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,450
嘿。
Hey.

257
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,480

This is Bobby.

259
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,320
你们要不要再来一杯？
Do you boys need another drink?

260
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,490
-我要点一杯屎火箭. -屎火箭是什么鬼？
-I'm getting a shitrocket. -What the hell's a shitrocket?

261
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,460
它就像红牛饮料，但含有蛋白质。
It's like a Red Bull but with protein.

262
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,390
噢。
Oh.

263
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,430
那我就点一杯屎火箭和伏特加吧。
Shitrocket and vodka, I guess.

264
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,560
快走，伙计们。爸爸需要喝一杯。

你看起来很生气。
You look angry.

267
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,610
我?
Me?

268
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,810
好吧，我不是。
Well, I'm not.

269
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,480
我看起来就是这样。
That's just the way I look.

270
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,580
我知道呀。人们总是走到我跟前告诉我，
I know. People always come up to me and tell me that,

271
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,610
但我不是。
but I'm not.

272
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,180
我没生气。
I'm not angry.

273
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,620
我听你的播客。
I listen to your podcast.

274
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,950
哦，真的吗？
Oh, really?

275
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,550
哦，那太酷了。
Oh, that's cool.

276
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,260
我听说你很无聊。
I hear you're boring.

277
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,960
谁说的？我并不无聊。
Who said that? I'm not boring.

278
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,730
我不知道。
I don't know.

279
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,890
很多人。
A lot of people.

280
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,600
酷！
Cool.

281
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,600
对不起。那太刻薄了。
I'm sorry. That was mean.

282
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,670
我很不会调情。
I'm very bad at flirting.

283
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,310
我也是那种会告诉你我在调情的人，
And I'm also the type of person who tells you I'm flirting,

284
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,010
这太性感了。
which is so sexy.

285
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,840
没关系的。
It's okay.

286
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,350
你的工作是什么?
What do you do?

287
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,020
呃，工作么？
Uh, for work?

288
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,420
我是做遗嘱认证的。我是一名遗产规划师。
I do probate law. I'm an estate planner.

289
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,020
基本上，我写的是人的遗嘱。
Basically, I write people's wills.

290
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:38,060
-你喜欢吗？-哦，当然
-Do you like it? -Oh, sure.

291
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,060
当我还是个孩子的时候，我第一件事就是
When I was a kid, first thing I would think

292
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,590
当我遇到某人的时候，我会问：“那个人死后
when I would meet someone is, "Who's that person

293
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,690
会把他们的垃圾留给谁？“
gonna leave their shit to when they die?"

294
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,700
我真的很想成为其中的合规环节的一部分。
I really wanted to be part of the legal logistics of that.

295
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,770
真好笑。
That's funny.

296
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,300
那家伙很辣，对吧？
That guy's hot, right?

297
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,510
哦，是啊。他是。
Oh, yeah. He is.

298
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,280
我晚点应该会去操他和他丈夫。
I'm supposed to fuck him and his husband later.

299
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,980
挺好的。
Cool.

300
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,650
非常好。
Very good.

301
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,990
-哦，我喜欢这首歌.-这是什么？
-Oh, I love this song. -What is this?

302
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,720
老派的玛丽亚。
Old-school Mariah.

303
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,890
你怎么会不知道呢？
How do you not know this?

304
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,930
我更像是个乡下人。
I'm more of a country guy.

305
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,700
你知道，就像加思·布鲁克斯。
You know, like Garth Brooks.

306
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,930
加思·布鲁克斯？
Garth Brooks?

307
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,600
你是谁？
Who are you?

308
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,470
♪我不想放手，尽管我应该♪
♪ I don't wanna let go and although I should ♪

309
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,410
♪我不能留下你一个人因为...♪
♪ I can't leave you alone 'cause... ♪

310
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,340
事实上，凯莉·安德伍德在推特上屏蔽了我。
Actually, Carrie Underwood blocked me on Twitter...

311
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,880
♪和我无法抗拒..。♪
♪ And I cannot resist... ♪

312
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,380
他妈的怎么回事?
What the fuck?

313
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,850
-他妈的他去哪了？-我不知道
-Where the fuck did he go? -I don't know.

314
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,480
这就是我讨厌这些人的原因。
This is why I hate these people.

315
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,850
天哪。这位是65岁的老人。
Oh, my God. That's the 65-year-old.

316
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,760
天哪，他被撕裂了。
Jesus, he's ripped.

317
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,130
我知道呀。就像他们给邓布利多注射了类固醇。
I know. It's like they injected steroids into Dumbledore.

318
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,900
嘿，怎么了？
Hey, what's up?

319
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,140
-谢谢.-嘿.
-Thanks. -Hey.

320
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,970
你去哪里了？
Where'd you go?

321
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,610
我不知道。无处可去。
I don't know. Nowhere.

322
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,080
耶，好好过你们的生活，女王们！
Yas, live your lives, queens!

323
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,910
咯咯咯
Okurrr.

324
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,750
基佬们都太蠢了。
Gay guys are so stupid.

325
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,390
噢，天哪，我知道。
Oh, my God, I know.

326
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,590
基佬们通常是，要么聪明绝顶
Gay guys are usually, like, the absolute smartest

327
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,560
要么就是，我见过的最蠢的人。
or, like, the dumbest people I've ever met.

328
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,030
我们已经足够聪明地给自己打上了
We've been smart enough to brand ourselves

329
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,060
聪明又机智的标签。
as being smart and clever.

330
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,600
我曾经和一些男人们勾搭过，
I've hooked up with guys,

331
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,000
然后我通常会开个玩笑
and afterwards I'll make a joke

332
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,830
或者就是说些讽刺的话。
or I'll say something sarcastic.

333
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,440
但是那家伙不明白我是在开玩笑。
And the guy does not understand that I'm making a joke.

334
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:35,170
完全不理解讽刺。
Literally does not understand satire.

335
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,610
我知道。
I know.

336
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,610
然后异性恋们还觉得我们都很聪明，
And straight people think we're all smart,

337
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,610
-但许多这些人都像狗屎一样愚蠢。  -就是。
-but a lot of these guys are dumb as shit. -Yes.

338
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,780
这是我们的小秘密。
It's our little secret.

339
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,390
其实.。
Actually...

340
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,730
你他妈的在开玩笑吗？
Are you fucking kidding me?

341
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,040
-嘿.-嘿，你在说什么？
-Hey. -Hey, what were you talking

342
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,640
跟Aaron谈了这么久？
to Aaron about for so long?

343
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,700
只是关于很多同性恋者
Just about how a lot of gay guys

344
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,170
都偷偷地愚蠢得令人难以置信。
are secretly incredibly stupid.

345
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,710
-哦，太棒了.-我不明白.
-Oh, how fabulous. -I don't understand.

346
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,680
我们玩得很开心，然后他就来找我了。
We're having a good time, and then he ghosts me.

347
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,950
他就这么他妈的消失了。
He just fucking disappears.

348
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,780
鲍比，别这样，算了吧。他是个混蛋。
Bobby, don't. Let it go. He's a dick.

349
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,520
不，我不会就此罢休的。我不会听之任之。
No, I am not letting it go. I do not let things go.

350
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,190
-你为什么不跳舞？-我在跳舞，好吗？
-Why aren't you dancing? -I am dancing, okay?

351
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,760
你想让我怎么做，他妈的胡桃夹子套房？
What do you want me to do, the fucking Nutcracker Suite?

352
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,890
嘿。
Hey.

353
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,060
嘿，怎么了？
Hey, what's up?

354
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,600
我想吻你
I tried to kiss you

355
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,530
你没有回吻我是怎么回事。
and you didn't kiss me back is what's up.

356
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,100
对不起。我很害羞。
I'm sorry. I'm shy.

357
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,730
请。你喜欢什么？
Please. What are you into?

358
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,740
这些无聊的，撕裂的白痴中的一个没有意见的？
One of these boring, ripped idiots with no opinions?

359
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,510
不，我想要一个身体非常虚弱的人
No, I'd like someone who's physically very frail

360
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,510
而且不会停止说话。
and won't stop talking.

361
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,220
跟我回家吧。
Come home with me.

362
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,050
我不行。
I can't.

363
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,750
为什么？
Why?

364
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,760
因为你必须操那个假棒球手
'Cause you have to fuck the fake baseball player

365
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,690
他的丈夫呢？
and his husband?

366
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,630
我不知道该怎么跟你说。
I don't know what to tell you.

367
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,660
-再见。-嘿，等等，等等.
-Goodbye. -Hey, wait, wait.

368
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,170
-记下我的号码.-绝对不是.
-Take my number. -Absolutely not.

369
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,570
为什么？
Why?

370
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,200
因为我是聪明人之一，混蛋
'Cause I'm one of the smart ones, asshole.

371
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,240
哦，你是不是在感情上无暇顾及？
Oh, are you emotionally unavailable?

372
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,500
没有人比我更情绪化了。
No one's more emotionally unavailable than me.

373
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,610
无名之辈。我为自己感到自豪。
No one. I pride myself on that.

374
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,910
无论如何，这都无关紧要。
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

375
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,110
亨利有我的号码。
Henry has my number.

376
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,740
Grindr或Zellweger上见
See you on Grindr or Zellweger

377
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,510
或者他妈的下一个是什么。
or whatever the fuck the next one is.

378
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,020
我没有吃过任何一种。
I'm not on any of those.

379
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,020
那你是怎么认识人的呢？
Then how do you meet people?

380
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,750
我并不是真的在看。
I'm not really looking.

381
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,520
嗯。
Yeah.

382
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,620
我也是。
Me neither.

383
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,260
打扰了。打扰了。
Excuse me. Excuse me.

384
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,700
打扰了。
Excuse me.

385
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,000
哦，天哪，他们不停地发牢骚。
Oh, my God, they cannot stop voguing.

386
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,270
他们停不下来了！
They cannot stop voguing!

387
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,000
打扰了。
Excuse me.

388
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,270
我知道你在发牢骚，但我能回家了吗？拜托了？！
I know you're voguing, but can I please go home? Please?!

389
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,640
我有一种直觉
I had a gut feeling

390
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,010
你现在就可以上网了。
you would be online now.

391
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,610
嗨。
Hi.

392
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,280
嘿，怎么了？
Hey, what's up?

393
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,780
不是很多。你?
Not much. You?

394
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,550
不是的。
No.

395
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,720
但我们互相匿名发短信。
But us texting each other anonymously.

396
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,290
我从来没有意识到Grindr有这么多
I never realized how much Grindr was

397
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,590
就像你有邮件一样。笑脸。
just like You've Got Mail. Smiley face.

398
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,660
哈哈。LOL。迪克的照片？
Ha ha. LOL. Dick pic?

399
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,800
没有迪克的照片。抱歉的。
No dick pic. Sorry.

400
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,800
想想你有了邮件。
Think about You've Got Mail.

401
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,970
梅格·瑞恩永远不会给你寄她生殖器的照片。
Meg Ryan would never send you a picture of her genitalia.

402
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,670
哈哈哈。LOLOL, 我能看看你的屁股吗？
Ha ha. LOLOL. Can I see your ass?

403
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,970
没有屁股照，抱歉。
Don't have ass pic. Sorry.

404
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,740
但我还是要看屁股照。
Need to see ass pic, though.

405
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,840
我没有屁股照！
Don't have ass pic!

406
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,080
那我们别见面了
Not gonna meet up

407
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,980
除非你发一张屁股照。
unless you send ass pic.

408
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,310
一定要看屁股的照片！
Must see pic of ass!

409
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,000
噢！
Ow!

410
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,070
操!
Fuck!

411
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,300
我在流血！
I'm bleeding!

412
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,940
我现在该怎么拉屎呢？
How am I gonna shit now?

413
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,310
我操不了人。我拉不了屎。
I can't fuck. I can't shit.

414
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,840
我不是人，该死的！
I'm not a person, goddamn it!

415
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,150
太他妈平坦了。
It's too fucking flat.

416
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,960
这是专门为你拍的，兄弟。
Took this just for you, bro.

417
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,000
他是把我拉黑了吗？
Did he block me?

418
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,170
狗娘养的！
Motherfucker!

419
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,840
霍尔哈特电视台骄傲地呈现
Hallheart proudly presents

420
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,110
我们的第一部双性恋假日电影，
our first bisexual holiday film,

421
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,910
获奖的圣诞节有两个人。
the award-winning Christmas with Either.

422
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,380
哈勒哈特。总是走在最前列。
Hallheart. Always on the cutting edge...

423
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:39,120
圣诞节的时候。
of Christmas.

424
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,890
人民。好吧。
People. Okay.

425
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,250
好了，各位！
Okay, people!

426
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,860
各位，求求你们！已经这么晚了。
People, please! It's getting late.

427
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,690
我们还需要找到一位捐赠者来资助
We still need to find a donor to fund

428
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,190
最后一翼的展品。
the exhibit in the final wing.

429
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,130
如你所知，一号码头进口公司本应制造
As you know, Pier 1 Imports was supposed to make

430
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,800
一大笔捐款，但他们破产了
a big donation, but they went bankrupt

431
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,260
并已被塔利班收买。
and have been bought by the Taliban.

432
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,370
塔利班。
Taliban.

433
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,900
因此，我们还缺500万美元。
So, we are short $5 million.

434
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,740
我们再也推不起开业了。
We cannot afford to push our opening again.

435
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,970
人们会认为我们有麻烦了。
People will think we're in trouble.

436
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,810
也许整个地方都会分崩离析。
Maybe this whole place could fall apart.

437
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,370
我们需要新的想法来决定最后一翼的内容，
We need new ideas for what goes in the final wing,

438
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,740
我们现在就需要他们。
and we need them now.

439
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,010
-切丽，走吧.-你知道蓝鲸吗
-Cherry, go. -You know the blue whale

440
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,740
挂在自然历史博物馆？
hanging in the Museum of Natural History?

441
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,450
-是的。-那又如何？
-Yes. -What about that,

442
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,750
但它不是蓝鲸，而是女同性恋？
but instead of the blue whale, it's a lesbian?

443
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,720
-哦，不.嗯-嗯。-好的，好的.
- Oh, no. Uh-uh. - Yeah, okay.

444
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,220
-嗯，是的，我们不能这么做.-没有。
-Well, yeah, we can't do that. -No.

445
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,290
一个来自土著民族的变性人呢？
What about a transgender woman from an Indigenous nation?

446
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,360
该死的，旺达！
Goddamn it, Wanda!

447
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,460
那400个女同性恋呢？
What about the 400 lesbians

448
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,030
谁参加了南北战争？
who fought in the Civil War?

449
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,170
闭嘴，樱桃。她们并不都是女同性恋。
Shut up, Cherry. They were not all lesbians.

450
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,700
他们中的一些人是变性人。
Some of them were trans men.

451
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,770
好了，停下来。这座建筑是一个难得的机会
Okay, stop. This building is a rare chance

452
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,170
使双性恋者的历史合法化。
to legitimize the history of bisexuals.

453
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,270
哦，上帝。我们开始吧。
Oh, God. Here we go.

454
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,810
是!我们说“LGBTQ”
Yes! We say "LGBTQ,"

455
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,280
但我们总是跳过“B”字。
but we always skip over the "B."

456
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,910
我想要一个双性恋的大厅，
I want a hall of bisexuals,

457
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,780
就像迪士尼的总统会堂。
like Disney's Hall of Presidents.

458
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:49,050
我想要一个充满动漫的、会说话的双性恋的舞台。
I want a stage full of animatronic, talking bisexuals.

459
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,350
说话、移动和打手势的双性恋者。
Talking and moving and gesturing bisexuals.

460
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,860
你猜怎么着？
You know what?

461
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,330
这恰好是双性恋意识周，
This happens to be Bisexual Awareness Week,

462
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,360
但还没有人承认这一点！
and no one has acknowledged it!

463
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,960
-我承认。-是这样的。我的错。
-I acknowledged. -That is true. My bad.

464
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,500
女同性恋历史月是在三月份。
Lesbian History Month was in March.

465
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,470
他妈的什么都没说！
Nobody said a goddamn thing!

466
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,170
现在是六月！
It's June!

467
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,740
那是在三月份！
It was in March!

468
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:11,170
当然，女同性恋者有一个月的时间，我们有一周的时间。
Of course lesbians get a month and we get a week.

469
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,910
-罗伯特。-什么？
-Robert. -What?

470
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,810
我想让你知道我听到了。
I want you to know that I hear you.

471
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,880
我看到了你，我为你保留了空间。
I see you, and I'm holding space for you.

472
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,980
她来了。她来了。
There she go. There she go.

473
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,920
她从来没有自己的想法，
She never has any ideas of her own,

474
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,390
但她总是“留有空间”。
but she's always "holding space."

475
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,820
一位女同性恋者写下了《美丽的美国》。
A lesbian wrote "America the Beautiful."

476
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,960
-天啊，不.我做不到，-凯瑟琳·李·贝茨
-God, no. I can't. -Katharine Lee Bates

477
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,430
把歌词写在餐巾纸上。
wrote the lyrics on a napkin.

478
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,800
如果你去她在弗吉尼亚州的家，他们有餐巾！
If you go to her house in Virginia, they have the napkin!

479
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,470
如果最后的展品是
What if the final exhibit was

480
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,970
一场古怪婚礼的重演？
a recreation of a queer wedding?

481
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,870
-我喜欢这样.-好的，我不讨厌这个.
-I like that. -Okay, that I don't hate.

482
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,970
塔玛拉，你太贴心了。
Tamara, that is so sweet.

483
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,240
我喜欢那样。人们可以
I love that. And people can

484
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,870
来这里登记结婚礼物吧。
come and register for wedding gifts here.

485
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,180
我要把它写下来。
I'm gonna write that down.

486
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,240
哦，天哪，还有--不！
Oh, my God, and-- No!

487
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,380
这是老式的，
That is old-fashioned,

488
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,910
异性恋的胡说八道。
heteronormative nonsense.

489
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,110
我们需要让人们重新思考历史
We need to get people to rethink history

490
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,120
通过奇怪的棱镜，而不是安慰他们
through a queer prism, not comfort them

491
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,050
又一场他妈的同性恋婚礼，好吗？
with another fucking gay wedding, all right?

492
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,920
这是个博物馆。这不是Schitt‘s Creek
It's a museum. It's not Schitt's Creek.

493
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:57,950
-哦，我喜欢希特溪.但我--
-Ooh, I like Schitt's Creek. -But I--

494
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,260
哦，我爱死施特溪了。
Oh, I love Schitt's Creek.

495
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,990
-那部剧是有层次的。-好的.
- That show has layers. - All right.

496
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,260
每个人都喜欢席特的小溪。太棒了。好吧。
Everyone loves Schitt's Creek. Great. Okay.

497
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,830
这就是你让我想起的人。尤金·利维。
That's who you remind me of. Eugene Levy.

498
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,130
是。
Yes.

499
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,800
好的，芬克先生。
Okay, Mr. Funk.

500
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,870
今天有什么可以帮您的吗？
How can I help you today?

501
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,800
我需要调整一下我的意志。
I need to adjust my will.

502
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,540
好吧。我能问你为什么吗？
Okay. Can I ask you why?

503
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,240
因为我快死了。
Because I'm dying.

504
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,470
我得了癌症。
I have cancer.

505
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,010
听到这个消息我很难过。
I'm so sorry to hear that.

506
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,940
我只需要弄清楚我的钱去哪了。
I just need to figure out where my money's going.

507
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,550
好的，呃，你有伴侣或配偶吗？
Okay, uh, do you have a partner or spouse?

508
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,280
不是也不是。
No and no.

509
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,420
-孩子？-不是.
-Children? -No.

510
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,090
-家人？-不是.
-Family member? -No.

511
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,590
-亲密朋友？-不再是了.
-Close friend? -Not anymore.

512
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,990
好吧，嗯.
Okay, um...

513
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,260
嗯，呃，有时候闭上眼睛会很有帮助
well, uh, sometimes it helps to close your eyes

514
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:40,000
想想世界上谁对你来说最重要。
and think about who means the most to you in the world.

515
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,570
呃，是谁？
Uh, who is it?

516
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,570
雪儿。
Cher.

517
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,580
好的，所以你想留下10万美元...
Okay, so you want to leave $100,000...

518
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,040
对雪儿？
to Cher?

519
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,880
你真的觉得她需要这样吗？
Do you really think that she needs that?

520
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,050
她有一个庞大的员工队伍。
She has a huge staff.

521
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,320
呃，好的。
Uh, okay.

522
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,920
谢泼德先生，抱歉打扰了
Mr. Shepard, uh-- Sorry to interrupt.

523
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,920
贝利夫人去世了。
Mrs. Bailey passed away.

524
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,630
哦，天哪，这太令人沮丧了。
Oh, God, this is so depressing.

525
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,160
我太抱歉了。
I'm so sorry.

526
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,460
我只能想象你所经历的一切。
I can only imagine what you're going through.

527
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,530
不，我是说你的工作。
No, I mean your job.

528
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,100
太令人沮丧了。
What a downer.

529
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,270
我是亚伦。格林德尔怎么样了？
It's Aaron. How's Grindr?

530
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,910
一场梦。我花了45分钟
A dream. I spent 45 minutes

531
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,510
给自己的屁股拍张照。
taking a picture of my own ass.

532
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,210
你好吗？
How are you?

533
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,050
和那个假芝加哥小熊的群交怎么样？
How was group sex with that faux Chicago Cub?

534
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,080
挺好玩的。他们邀请我明天再来。
It was fun. They invited me back tomorrow.

535
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,620
他们的代孕妈妈怀孕了，
Their surrogate is pregnant,

536
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,050
他们正在举行一场性别揭秘狂欢。
and they're having a gender reveal orgy.

537
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,620
性别揭秘狂欢？
A gender reveal orgy?

538
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,620
詹姆斯·鲍德温会非常自豪的。
James Baldwin would be so proud.

539
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,130
LOL。我醒来时笑着说
LOL. I woke up laughing about

540
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,370
你在我的狗屎上如此粗鲁地叫我。
you so rudely calling me out on my shit.

541
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,030
这是你应得的，婊子。
Well, you deserved it, bitch.

542
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,570
老实说，我被打动了。
Honestly, I was impressed.

543
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,440
你可能比我更情绪化
You may be more emotionally unavailable than I am.

544
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,940
好吧，也许我们可以
Well, maybe we can be

545
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,070
感情上不能在一起。
emotionally unavailable together.

546
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,510
“也许我们可以成为
"Maybe we can be

547
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,040
感情上不能在一起“？
emotionally unavailable together"?

548
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,980
谁在写你的短信？栗色5号？
Who's writing your texts? Maroon 5?

549
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,680
-滚开.-开玩笑的！
- Fuck off. - Kidding!

550
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,680
我们可以出去玩。你是在约我出去吗？
We can go out. Are you asking me out?

551
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,620
-我愿意做任何事.-是的，我也是.
- I'm down for whatever. - Yeah, same.

552
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,280
-太好了。-听起来不错.
-Cool. -Sounds good.

553
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,090
那么，明天呢？或者我们可以做任何事。
So, tomorrow? Or we can do whatever.

554
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,990
是的，我什么时候都可以做，而且我可以做任何事情。
Yeah, I can do whenever, and I can do whatever.

555
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,460
-我不在乎我们做什么.-是啊，我也是.
-I don't care what we do. -Yeah, me neither.

556
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,430
我们可以做任何事情，而且我们可以在任何时候做。
We can do whatever, and we can do it whenever.

557
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,560
-这对你管用吗？-当然管用.
-Does that work for you? -Yeah, that definitely works.

558
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,230
太棒了。无论何时何地都可以。
Great. Whatever, whenever.

559
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,530
凉爽的。无论何时何地都可以。
Cool. Whatever, whenever.

560
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,270
迈克尔·斯科特跳舞的GIF。
GIF of Michael Scott dancing.

561
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,270
他很棒。
He's good.

562
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,300
Office GIF？
Office GIF?

563
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,670
这个人不是同性恋。
This person isn't gay.

564
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,300
心。啊，不。
Heart. Ugh, no.

565
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,610
无心之心。行，可以。
Un-heart. Thumbs up.

566
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,270
-和平。-和平？
- Peace. - Peace?

567
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,410
后来。
Later.

568
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,250
你能留心我的“晚点”吗，婊子？
Can you heart my "later," bitch?

569
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,510
再见。
Bye.

570
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,190
你是本地人，对吗？
You're from here, right?

571
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,690
你父母还住在城里吗？
Your parents still live in the city?

572
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,160
不是的。事实上，我的父母都去世了。
No. My parents both passed away actually.

573
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,490
-哦，对不起.-哦，是的。谢谢。
-Oh, I'm sorry. -Oh, yeah. Thanks.

574
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,690
不是最近的。
It wasn't recent.

575
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,160
我妈妈在我上大学的时候去世了，
My mom died when I was in college,

576
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,530
我父亲大概十年前就去世了。
and my dad died like ten years ago.

577
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,030
一只蜜蜂！一只蜜蜂！一只蜜蜂！
A bee! A bee! A bee!

578
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,270
-一只蜜蜂！一只蜜蜂！一只蜜蜂！-哇，哇，哇！
-A bee! A bee! A bee! -Whoa, whoa, whoa!

579
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,570
别再拍打了。你会杀了它的。
Stop swatting. You're gonna kill it.

580
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,400
这就是我想要做的。
Well, that's what I'm trying to do.

581
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,600
它在我的脖子上。
It's on my neck.

582
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,670
那只蜜蜂快被你打死了，你看不出来吗？
The bees are dying. Don't you read?

583
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,170
对，这蜜蜂要么恐同要么讨厌看电影。
Yes, about gay stuff and movies.

584
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,170
-你帮忙把它赶走吗？   -好的
-Can you, like, do something? -Yes.

585
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,310
好啦，好啦，好啦，好啦，快搞定了。
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Here it is.

586
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,280
-你要摸到那只蜜蜂了！   -我知道.
-You're touching the bee! -I know.

587
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,110
好吧。
Okay.

588
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,580
哇。谢谢。
Wow. Thank you.

589
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,450
你就像一个成年的同性恋童子军，
You're like a grown-up gay Boy Scout,

590
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,050
我就像是在遭遇埃文·汉森身上发生的一切。
and I'm like whatever ends up happening to Evan Hansen.

591
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,460
让我看看正在上演什么电影。
Let me see what's playing.

592
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,990
你一直以来最喜欢的电影是什么？
What's your favorite movie of all time?

593
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,730
我一直以来最喜欢的电影是什么？
What's my favorite movie of all time?

594
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,000
我不知道。
I don't know.

595
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,630
为什么？你最喜欢的电影是什么？
Why? What's your favorite movie?

596
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,330
《宿醉》。
The Hangover.

597
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:33,340
《宿醉》是你一直以来最喜欢的电影？
The Hangover is your favorite movie of all time?

598
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,240
你看过多少部电影？就一部而已吗?
How many movies have you seen? One?

599
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,370
-这电影挺有趣的。   -是啊，算是吧.
-It's a funny movie. -Yeah, kinda.

600
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,780
你还记得那部电影的前几句台词吗？
And you remember one of the first lines of that movie?

601
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,610
（Faggot是对同性恋的蔑称）



“呼叫基佬医生。”
"Paging Dr. Faggot."

602
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,110
还记得吗           -记得
-Remember that? -Yes.

603
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,750
“呼叫基佬医生”是在2009年票房最高的喜剧中的。
"Paging Dr. Faggot" is one of the first lines

604
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,620
第一行台词之一
of the highest-grossing comedy of 2009,

605
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,050
而且没有人谈论这件事。
and-and no one talks about it.

606
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,620
对吗？也不是很久以前。
Right? And it wasn't that long ago.

607
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,390
你知道，我们应该，就像，一笑置之。
You know, we're just supposed to, like, laugh it off.

608
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,260
那倒是没有困扰到我。我没有那么敏感。
It doesn't bother me. I'm not sensitive like that.

609
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,190
我觉得你就是喜欢对一些事情发火。
I think you just like getting angry at things.

610
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,190
对一些事情发火，就好像是，你的个人标签。
Getting angry at things is, like, your brand.

611
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,060
啥？!不，才不是！去你的 !
What?! No, it's not! Fuck you!

612
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,630
喜欢发火是我的招牌吗？
Getting angry at things is my brand?

613
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,100
不，不，不，不，不，不，不。
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

614
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,370
你只是不喜欢抱怨而已
You just don't like to complain about it

615
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,770
因为这意味着你的感情受到了伤害，
because that means your feelings were hurt,

616
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,100
这意味着承认你很软弱。
and that means admitting you're weak.

617
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,370
而这太容易让你受伤了。
And that's too vulnerable.

618
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,140
当我们到处说
And as much as we go around saying

619
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,740
男人应该是脆弱的，你我都知道
men should be vulnerable, you and I both know

620
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,140
那就是胡扯。
that is such bullshit.

621
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,580
因为对于很多基佬来说，
Because for a lot of these gay guys,

622
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:18,110
甜蜜和脆弱是美妙和可爱的，
sweetness and vulnerability are wonderful and lovely,

623
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,280
但它们也可能是一个真正的疯狂杀手。
but they can also be a real boner killer.

624
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,550
你很有激情。
You're very intense.

625
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,120
是的。
Yes.

626
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:28,160
-顺便说一句，我是在开玩笑的.    -关于什么？
-I was kidding, by the way. -About what?

627
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,060
《宿醉》。这不是我最喜欢的电影。
The Hangover. It's not my favorite movie.

628
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,830
-不，你才没有.     -是啊，我就是在开玩笑.
-No, you weren't. -Yeah, I was.

629
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,200
我就是喜欢看你发火。
I just like seeing you get riled up.

630
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:38,270
-我不相信你.             -我开玩笑的.
-I don't believe you. -I was kidding.

631
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,540
嗯。
Hmm.

632
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,410
我不喜欢这样。
I don't like this.

633
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,410
好吧。让我们看看我们这里有什么。
Okay. Let's see what we have here.

634
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,650
嗯-嗯。
Mm-hmm.

635
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,220
哦，《内里宝藏》
Oh, The Treasure Inside

636
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,580
其实这电影应该是挺好看的。
is supposed to be really good, actually.

637
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,120
讲什么的？
What's that about?

638
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,420
这是关于两个深柜的同性恋拓荒者的故事
It's about two closeted gay frontiersmen

639
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:59,260
在1849年的加州淘金热中。
in the California Gold Rush of 1849.

640
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:01,220
但这实际上是两个异性恋演员扮演同性恋，
But really it's about two straight actors playing gay,

641
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,560
想要冲击奥斯卡奖。
trying to win an Oscar.

642
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:05,300
我永远不会厌倦看两个非常直男的演员
I never tire of watching two very straight actors

643
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,500
真的把他们自己转变成了悲伤的基佬。
really transform themselves into being sad and gay.

644
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:10,200
同性恋演员扮演同性恋--这甚至都不是表演。
Gay actors playing gay-- that's not even acting.

645
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,500
噢，我完全同意。
Oh, I totally agree.

646
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,270
如果他们拍一部关于我的生活的电影，
If they ever make a movie about my life,

647
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,800
他们最好雇个直男演员。
they better hire a straight actor.

648
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,540
我喜欢把我的人生故事想象成
I like to think of my life story as

649
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,780
这只是本尼迪克特·康伯巴奇真正赚到票房的另一种方式。
just another way for Benedict Cumberbatch to really score.

650
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:22,180
好吧，那如果不看这部电影，我们该去干啥？
Okay, if we don't see this movie, what are we gonna do?

651
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,180
我又没说我不想看这部电影。
Well, I didn't say I didn't want to see the movie.

652
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,650
-哦。   -我就要去看那部该死的电影.
-Oh.    -I'll see the fucking movie.

653
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,520
我真的很想去看。
I'm dying to.

654
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:31,250
我会把它放在上面，叫我你的名字
I'd put it way above Call Me by Your Name

655
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,690
但比达拉斯的买家要低一些。
but sort of below Dallas Buyers.

656
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,290
好吧，它最终得到了我。
Well, it got me in the end.

657
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:37,290
是啊，但为什么总是这么悲惨呢？
Yeah, but why does it always have to be so tragic?

658
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,760
我不知道。费城，米尔克，断背。
I don't know. Philadelphia, Milk, Brokeback.

659
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,400
大团圆结局不会赢得奥斯卡奖。
Happy endings don't win Oscars.

660
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,700
异性恋者喜欢看到我们痛苦的样子。
Straight people love seeing us miserable.

661
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,870
-嗯.-等等，亚伦·谢泼德？
- Mm. - Wait, Aaron Shepard?

662
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,640
乔什·埃文斯？
Josh Evans?

663
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:50,610
-我靠！怎么了，伙计？-嘿，伙计。兄弟！
-Holy shit! What is up, dude? -Hey, man. Bro!

664
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,610
-很高兴见到你.-这是他妈的-永远的.
-Nice to see you. -It's been for-fucking-ever.

665
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,380
亚伦和我--我们高中时打过曲棍球。
Aaron and I-- we played hockey in high school.

666
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,880
这是我的未婚妻萨曼莎。
This is my fiancée Samantha.

667
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,710
-嘿.见到你很高兴。-嘿.
- Hey. Nice to meet you. - Hey.

668
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,350
呃，这是，呃，鲍比。
Uh, this is, uh, Bobby.

669
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,420
-嘿.-嘿.
- Hey. - Hey.

670
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,820
我们刚看到里面的宝藏。
We just saw The Treasure Inside.

671
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,690
这是关于秘密的同性恋拓荒者的故事。
It's about closeted gay frontiersmen.

672
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,250
噢。好吧。好的。
Oh. Okay. Nice.

673
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,320
就像是一部愚蠢的电影。
It's just, like, some dumb movie.

674
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,830
哦，等等。我想看到这一点。
Oh, wait. I want to see that.

675
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,560
同性恋是我的最爱。
Gay guys are my jam.

676
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,160
嗯。
Hmm.

677
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,730
你们在这干嘛呢？
So what are you guys doing here?

678
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,230
只是一次小小的旅行。
Just a little trip.

679
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,600
这是她第一次来纽约。
It's her first time in New York City.

680
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,670
这座城市病了。
This city is sick.

681
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,440
-真的是这样-是的
-It really is. -Yeah.

682
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,900
好吧..。太棒了。
Well... awesome.

683
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,270
-是的-很高兴见到你，鲍勃.
-Yeah. -Uh, nice to meet you, Bob.

684
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,770
很高兴见到你们。
Nice to meet you guys.

685
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,340
这太疯狂了。
That is crazy.

686
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,780
我从来没有遇到过我家乡的任何人。
I never run into anybody from my hometown.

687
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,380
哦，好的，兄弟。完全正确，兄弟。
Oh, yeah, bro. Totally, bro.

688
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,920
只是一部愚蠢的电影，兄弟。
Just some dumb movie, bro.

689
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,920
我在高中时对他有过最大的迷恋。
I had the biggest crush on him in high school.

690
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,920
是啊。这就是追踪。
Yep. That tracks.

691
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:41,320
嗯，就像《最伟大的表演者》里的大胡子女士，
Well, like the bearded lady in The Greatest Showman,

692
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,690
这就是我。
this is me.

693
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,360
噢。
Oh.

694
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,900
假的芝加哥小熊？
The faux Chicago Cub?

695
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,800
嗯。他丈夫刚给我寄来的。
Yeah. His husband just sent me that.

696
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:53,800
哇。它们非常热。
Wow. They are extremely hot.

697
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,210
是啊，迈克和道格--他们是被淘汰的笨蛋。
Yeah, Mike and Doug-- they're these roided-out meatheads.

698
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,370
他们不是最聪明的，但他们真的很可爱。
They're not the brightest, but they're really sweet.

699
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,480
你想去那边吗？
Do you want to go over there?

700
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,280
等。你又要抛弃我了吗？
Wait. Are you ditching me again

701
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,410
去操棒球角色扮演者和他的丈夫？
to go fuck the baseball cosplayer and his husband?

702
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,750
不，我不会丢下你的。我在邀请你。
No, I'm not ditching you. I'm inviting you.

703
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,950
你为什么不直接上楼来呢？
Why don't you just come upstairs?

704
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:13,690
啊，我真的不是很擅长谈恋爱。
Ah, I don't really do the whole relationship thing very well.

705
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,560
关系？
Relationship?

706
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:18,760
我什么时候说过我想和你谈恋爱了？
When did I say I wanted to be in a relationship with you?

707
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,700
我们真的有一天出去玩了。
We literally hung out one day.

708
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:21,960
是啊，但如果我上楼，
Yeah, but if I go upstairs,

709
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,970
它变成了，就像，一整件事……
it becomes, like, a whole thing and...

710
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,600
管他呢。我们应该直接去那边。
Whatever. We should just go over there.

711
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,840
会很有趣的。
It'll be fun.

712
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,240
我不会去的，但你应该去。
I'm not gonna go, but you should go.

713
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,610
不过，我能问你一件事吗？
Can I ask you one thing, though?

714
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,570
如果你不想勾搭为什么要发短信给我？
Why did you text me if you didn't want to hook up?

715
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,980
我没生气。我只是真的很好奇。
I'm not angry. I'm just honestly curious.

716
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:37,350
我没说我不想--我...
I didn't say I didn't want to-- I...

717
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,480
我想我在俱乐部跟你聊得很开心，
I guess I had fun talking to you at the club,

718
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,990
我想说，“嘿，怎么了？”
and I wanted to say, "Hey, what's up?"

719
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,690
“嘿，怎么了？”
"Hey, what's up?"

720
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,560
所以，基本上你是在宿醉的时候给我发短信
So, basically you texted me when you were feeling hungover

721
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,860
在那一刻很孤独，但你并不是真的喜欢我，
and lonely in that moment, but you're not actually into me,

722
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,330
但你还是去约会了。
but you went on the date anyway.

723
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,500
为什么男同性恋者这么奇怪？
Why are gay guys so weird?

724
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,400
实际上，你知道，我们并不奇怪。
Actually, you know, we're not weird.

725
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,470
我们只是不断地迎合自己的突发奇想和需求，
We're just constantly catering to our own whims and needs,

726
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,640
它可以在一瞬间改变，但我们从来没有想过
which can change on a dime, but we never even think about

727
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,640
另一个人的情感后果。
the emotional consequences of the other person.

728
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:05,540
无论如何，这是一场迎合你的突发奇想的爆炸。
Anyway, it's been a blast catering to your whims.

729
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,480
而且，老实说，我真的不能说什么
And, honestly, I can't really say anything about it

730
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,850
因为我总是对人做同样的事情，所以...
because I do the same thing to people all the time, so...

731
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,590
-有趣的一天。还有，嗯..。-有趣的一天。
-Fun day. And, um... -Fun day.

732
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,750
-是的-和那些家伙一起玩得开心.
-Yeah. -Have fun with those guys.

733
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,820
好吧。再见。
Okay. Bye.

734
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,630
鲍比，等等。
Bobby, wait.

735
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,540
♪当你带着破碎的心做梦的时候...♪
♪ When you're dreaming with a broken heart... ♪

736
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,600
我今天真的玩得很开心。
I had a really nice time today.

737
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,570
我也是。
Me, too.

738
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,670
我从来不约会，但那真的很有趣。
I never go on dates, but that was really fun.

739
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:40,540
嗯。我也玩得很开心。
Yeah. I had a really good time, too.

740
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,460
嘿，我要走了。
Hey, I'm gonna go.

741
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,530
哦，真的吗？
Oh, really?

742
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,630
嗯。
Yeah.

743
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,100
一切都还好吧？这是不是很奇怪？
Is everything okay? Is this weird?

744
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,060
哦不。不，这很有趣。太棒了。
Oh, no, no, no. No, it's fun. It's great.

745
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,530
我只是--我要走了。
I just-- I'm just gonna go.

746
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,400
-好的.-好的.回头见。
-Okay. -Okay. I'll see you.

747
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,900
-好的.再见。-好的.
-Okay. Bye. -Okay.

748
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,370
再见。
Bye.

749
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,800
嘿，伙计们，我要走了。非常感谢。
Hey, guys, I'm gonna go. Thank you so much.

750
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,670
-没有。你要走了？-是的，我得走了。
-No. You're leaving? -Yeah, I got to go.

751
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,110
好的，伙计。认识你我非常高兴。
All right, man. It was nice meeting you.

752
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,680
-是的，你也是.那真是太好了。-是的
-Yeah, you, too. It was lovely. -Yeah.

753
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,610
-谢谢你.-好的.晚安。
-Thank you. -All right. Good night.

754
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,850
好吧。好吧。
Okay. Okay.

755
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,950
谢谢你能来。我们确信布莱恩是同性恋，
Thanks for coming. We're convinced Brian's gay,

756
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,080
我觉得有他的同性恋叔叔在身边对他有好处。
and I think it's good for him to have his gay uncle around.

757
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,750
天哪。当然了。
Oh, my God. Of course.

758
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,650
我一直在这里当我的“G侄子”的好“炮手”。
I'm always here to be a good "guncle" to my "g-nephew."

759
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,120
-哦.-鲍比叔叔，你能读一下我的报告吗？
-Aw. -Uncle Bobby, will you read my report?

760
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,620
是关于弗雷迪·墨丘利的。
It's about Freddie Mercury.

761
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,490
他痴迷于波西米亚狂想曲。
He's obsessed with Bohemian Rhapsody.

762
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:31,960
哦，天哪，我爱死这个了。
Oh, my God, I love this.

763
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,730
和那部电影一样，你的报道有没有报道
And like that movie, does your report take a story

764
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,430
关于伟大的同性恋偶像之一，并让它
about one of the great gay icons and make it about

765
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,470
有一次他可能和一个女人上床了？
that one time he maybe had sex with a woman?

766
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,800
我以为弗雷迪·墨丘利是双性恋。
I thought Freddie Mercury was bi.

767
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,140
他有一个妻子。
He had a wife.

768
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,770
是啊，耶稣也是，而且他是同性恋。
Yeah, well, so did Jesus, and he was gay.

769
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,770
这是非常棒的，是对这部电影的改进。
This is excellent and an improvement on the film.

770
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:44,810
做得好!
Good job!

771
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,150
《宿醉》中的GIF是什么？
What are those GIFs from The Hangover?

772
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,710
没什么。
Nothing.

773
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,750
和我约会的那个家伙不停地给我发短信。
This guy I went out with won't stop texting me.

774
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,720
一个男人？真的？
A guy? Really?

775
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,520
-像Grindr那样的人？-不，令人震惊.
-Like a Grindr guy? -No, shockingly.

776
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:57,590
事实上，我在现实生活中遇到了这个人。
I actually met this one in real life.

777
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,020
鲍比！
Bobby!

778
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,460
太棒了！
That's fantastic!

779
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:01,660
你觉得你还能再见到他吗？
You think you're gonna see him again?

780
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,730
不是的。他告诉我他更喜欢群交
No. He told me he prefers group sex

781
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,060
一对一，因为一对一太激烈了
to one-on-one because one-on-one is too intense

782
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,660
并使之成为一件完整的事情。
and makes it a whole thing.

783
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,730
我们约会过一次，然后我们和三个人上了床。
We went on one date, and we had sex with three people.

784
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,530
如今的同性恋关系就像一辆小丑车。
Gay relationships these days are like a clown car.

785
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,940
哦，又来了一个。哦，看，又来了一个。
Oh, there's another one. Oh, look, another one.

786
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,810
哦，又来了一个？这太荒谬了。
Oh, another one? It's ridiculous.

787
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,510
另外，我觉得我不是他喜欢的类型。
Plus, I don't think I'm his type.

788
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,410
-你怎么知道？-因为我知道
-How do you know? -Because I know.

789
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,880
他告诉我他喜欢乡村音乐
He told me he likes country music

790
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:23,150
他最喜欢的歌手是加思·布鲁克斯。
and his favorite singer is Garth Brooks.

791
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,510
什么样的同性恋男人会说
What kind of gay man says

792
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,850
他最喜欢的歌手是加思·布鲁克斯？
his favorite singer is Garth Brooks?

793
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,880
这让我很害怕。
That scares me.

794
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,020
另外，我还能看到他喜欢的人。
Plus, I see the guys he likes.

795
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,750
他们都长得跟他一模一样。
They all look exactly like him.

796
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:33,720
他们都是，像，大块头，性感，直言不讳的家伙。
They're all these, like, big, hot, straight-acting dudes.

797
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,620
这不是我的风格。
It's just not me.

798
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,090
嗯，他是上身还是下身？
Well, is he a top or bottom?

799
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,730
这跟什么都有关系吗？
What does that have to do with anything?

800
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,060
也许你们都是谷底，这就是问题所在。
Maybe you're both bottoms, and that's the problem.

801
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,700
我并不总是垫底的，埃德加。
I'm not always the bottom, Edgar.

802
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,030
跳臀部舞！

803
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,570
-哦，臀部舞！-耶！
- Ooh, bottom dance! - Yeah!

804
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,040
天哪。
Oh, my God.

805
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,640
同性恋性行为更有趣
Gay sex was more fun

806
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,510
当异性恋的人对此感到不舒服的时候。
when straight people were uncomfortable with it.

807
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,740
他妈的Schitt‘s Creek
Fucking Schitt's Creek.

808
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,040
也许我们不应该再谈论
Maybe we should stop talking about

809
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,650
在你的孩子面前进行肛交。
anal sex in front of your children.

810
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,750
-不用了.-哦，别这样.这是生活中自然的一部分。
-Nah. -Oh, please. It's a natural part of life.

811
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,780
鲍比，再约他一次。你从来不喜欢任何人。
Bobby, ask him out again. You never like anyone.

812
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,580
他太帅了。
He is so handsome.

813
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,890
-你也是。-你-你是个辣妹.
-So are you. -Y-You're a hottie.

814
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,620
他，就像，在另一个层面上。他就像同性恋汤姆·布雷迪。
He is, like, on another level. He's like gay Tom Brady.

815
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,660
当我和他在一起的时候，我感觉就像他妈的艾尔法巴。
When I'm with him, I feel like friggin' Elphaba.

816
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,660
我打赌他被你吓得跟你被他吓到一样。
I bet he's as intimidated by you as you are by him.

817
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,660
-哦，是的。-我告诉你.
-Oh, yeah. -I'm telling you.

818
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,960
他只是害怕变得脆弱。
He's just scared of being vulnerable.

819
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,560
你们这一代人的同性恋
Gay guys from your generation

820
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,530
仍然有这些被压抑的男子气概问题，
still have all these pent-up masculinity issues,

821
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:18,940
你们只需要克服它就行了。
and you all just need to get over it already.

822
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,170
布莱恩班上一半的孩子都是非二进制的。
Half the kids in Brian's class are nonbinary.

823
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,510
这不公平，蒂娜。
Well, it's not fair, Tina.

824
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,140
我们得了艾滋病，他们得了欢乐合唱团。
We had AIDS, and they had Glee.

825
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,110
但有一件工作上的事
But there is a work thing

826
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,680
我在想也许可以邀请他来。
I was thinking of maybe inviting him to.

827
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,680
-也许吧.-什么，工作上的事？
- Maybe. - What, a work thing?

828
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:33,220
和很多名人和花花公子在一起？
With lots of celebrities and fancy people?

829
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,520
现在，你会为了给他留下深刻印象而装腔作势吗？
Now, are you gonna peacock to impress him?

830
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,850
不是的。这只是一个很大的筹款活动
No. It's just a big fundraiser

831
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,490
为了博物馆，我需要带个人去。
for the museum, and I need to bring someone.

832
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,220
你要上台吗？
Are you gonna be onstage?

833
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,560
不，我不会上台的，好吗？
No, I am not going to be onstage, okay?

834
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,890
我不是那种自恋的反社会的人。
I am not some sort of narcissistic sociopath.

835
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,760
谢谢你，Doja Cat。
Thank you, Doja Cat.

836
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,240
各位，津巴布韦有岩画
Everyone, there are rock paintings in Zimbabwe

837
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,740
它描绘了同性恋
which depict homosexuality

838
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:56,770
这可以追溯到公元前2000年。
that date back to the year 2000 BCE.

839
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,710
如果那些画上的人

840
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,780
又活了4000年才看到一个角色出现
had lived another 4,000 years to see a character come out

841
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:04,110
在费城总是阳光明媚。
on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.

842

843
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,780
哦，不。这是真的。

我是说，我永远不会那么做的，

854
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,870
-在一群这样的人面前讲话。-哦

我完全不知道。

872
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,800
通常，石墙是唯一一件

873
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,870
异性恋的人都知道同性恋的历史。
straight people know about queer history.

874
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,310
老实说，没有人真正知道

第一个向石墙扔砖头的人。

太不可思议了，对吧？

882
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,630
但这有点令人沮丧。
But it's kind of depressing.

883
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,730
这真让人沮丧?这让你很沮丧吗？
It's depressing? It made you depressed?

884
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,070
这是艾滋病、纳粹和同性恋恐惧症。

All of it's just-- it's kind of a downer.

886
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:32,670
好吧。那你还以为会是什么呢？
Okay. Well, what were you expecting?

887
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,270
博物馆之夜？
A Night at the Museum?

888
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,910
老实说，我的家人很喜欢那部电影。
Honestly, my family loves that movie.

889
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,840
哦，好吧。
Oh, okay.

890
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,640
哦，如果你做了这样的事呢？
Oh, what if you did something like that?

891
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,280
哪里-哪里的东西，它们活了起来，
Where-where the things, they come alive,

892
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,910
而他们，就像，对着你说话。
and they, like, talk at you.

893
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,610
“在那里，事情变得活灵活现，他们会对着你说话”？
"Where the things come alive, and they talk at you"?

894
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,280
-是的-具体是什么？哦，哦。

895

如果我们有，比如，

00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,150
-埃莉诺·罗斯福的半身像，对吗？-是的
-a bust of Eleanor Roosevelt, right? -Yeah.

897
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,850
你离得很近，然后突然，
And you get really close, and then all of a sudden,

898
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:53,160
你知道那不是埃莉诺·罗斯福。
you realize that's not Eleanor Roosevelt.

899
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,620
我是艾米·舒默。

900
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,960
-哦-不！

00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,840
我花了多长时间，
about how long this has taken me,

935
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,950
但有人告诉我，人们在自己的时间里做这件事。
but I'm told people do this in their own time.

936
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:01,120
我得到了我心目中的英雄科尔顿·安德伍德的授权
I've been empowered by my hero, Colton Underwood,

937
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:05,090
事实证明，我是同性恋。
to say that, as it turns out, I'm gay.

938
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,390
喜欢这个帖子，如果你喜欢我是同性恋的话。
And like this post if you like that I'm gay.

939
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,390
和平。
Peace.

940
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,830
天啊。
Holy shit.

941
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,800
所以我们开始来回奔波一段时间，
So we started going back and forth for a while,

942
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,170
最后，我就想，
and then at the end, I was just like,

943
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,140
“你为什么不把这张专辑叫做柠檬水呢？”
"Why don't you call the album Lemonade?"

944
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,340
鲍比？
Bobby?

945
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,770
当你准备好的时候。
When you're ready.

946
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,140
-什么？-等你准备好了.
-What? -When you're ready.

947
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,350
抱歉的。
Sorry.

948
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,250
好吧。人们想知道
Okay. People wonder

949
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,820
如果美国准备好迎接它的第一位同性恋总统。
if America is ready for its first gay president.

950
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,390
我说我们已经有一个了。
I say we already had one.

951
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,220
对于最后的机翼，请考虑
For the final wing, please consider

952
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,860
《林肯书信：美国同性恋爱情故事》。
The Lincoln Letters: A Gay American Love Story.

953
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,390
多年来，历史学家一直
For years, historians have

954
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,230
对林肯的性取向进行猜测。
speculated about Lincoln's sexuality.

955
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,860
他同睡一张床，并与他私下通信
He shared a bed and exchanged intimate letters with

956
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,870
多年来，包括约书亚·斯皮德在内的多个男人
multiple men over the years, including Joshua Speed

957
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,300
-和大卫·德里克森。速度..。-好吧，我阻止你了.
-and David Derrickson. Speed... -Okay, I'm stopping you.

958
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:54,000
鲍比，这行不通的。你不能说林肯是同性恋。
Bobby, it won't work. You can't say Lincoln was gay.

959
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,410
-为什么？-无法确认
-Why? -There's no way to confirm

960
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,010
这些都是性关系。
those were sexual relationships.

961
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,840
没有爱的证据。
There's no evidence of love.

962
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,810
当然没有爱的证据，罗伯特。
Well, of course there's no evidence of love, Robert.

963
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,980
我们不被允许存在。
We weren't allowed to exist.

964
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,910
我们怎么会有足够的证据呢？
How would we have enough evidence?

965
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,420
好吧，林肯娶了一个女人，有四个孩子。
Okay, Lincoln was married to a woman and had four children.

966
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:09,490
他不是同性恋，鲍比。
He was not gay, Bobby.

967
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,920
他可能是双性恋。
He might have been bi.

968
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:12,260
我告诉你！
I am telling you!

969
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,290
我们让世界抹去了同性恋的爱情故事
We have let the world erase gay love stories

970
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,560
从一开始就是这样。
since the beginning of time.

971
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:18,330
这是我们拒绝耻辱的机会
This is our chance to reject the shame

972
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,900
并恢复真相。
and restore the truth.

973
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,330
如果我们不这么做，我们就会让他们赢。
And if we don't do this, we're letting them win.

974
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,570
我们让异性恋恐怖分子赢了。
We're letting the heterosexual terrorists win.

975
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,140
异性恋恐怖分子？
The heterosexual terrorists?

976
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,540
-没错.-也有同性恋恐怖分子。
-That's right. -There are also gay terrorists.

977
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,440
而且有双重恐怖分子，好吗？
And there are bi terrorists, okay?

978
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:31,970
有很多双性恋恐怖分子。
There are many bisexual terrorists.

979
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,210
好吧，也有跨性恐怖分子。
Okay, there are trans terrorists, too.

980
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,980
凯特琳·詹纳。
Caitlyn Jenner.

981
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:37,010
够了，伙计们。让我们投票表决吧。
Enough, people. Let's vote on it.

982
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,620
好吧。
Okay.

983
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:43,120
看起来我们有两票
Looks like we have two votes

984
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,260
为了世界上伟大的双性恋者。
for The Great Bisexuals of the World.

985
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,620
谢谢你，有人。
Thank you, someone.

986
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,060
三票投给《林肯书信》。
And three votes for The Lincoln Letters.

987
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:49,490
-林肯赢了。-是的！
-Lincoln wins. -Yes!

988
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:52,100
谢谢!谢谢。
Thank you! Thank you.

989
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,530
黛布拉·梅辛在大楼里。
Debra Messing is in the building.

990
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,270
是!我的女孩。
Yes! My girl.

991
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,470
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

992
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,570
-是的-黛布拉·梅辛
-Yeah. -Debra Messing.

993
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,270
是啊，是啊，是啊。我很好。
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

994
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:05,080
好吧。祝我好运吧。
Okay. Wish me luck.

995
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,150
-梅辛小姐.-哦，请叫我黛布拉.
-Miss Messing. -Oh, please call me Debra.

996
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,610
-哦-哦
-Oh. -Oh.

997
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,450
我喜欢这个地方。
I love this space.

998
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,380
你怎么找到它的？
How did you find it?

999
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,490
哦，上帝。我们怎么找到它的？
Oh, God. How did we find it?

1000
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,160
呃，我不知道。对不起。
Um, I don't know. I'm sorry.

1001
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,560
你还好吗，亲爱的？你看起来有点慌乱。
Are you okay, dear? You seem a little flustered.

1002
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,090
请相信我。
Trust me.

1003
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:26,230
我知道我是黛布拉·梅辛，但我也是人。
I know I'm Debra Messing, but I'm only human.

1004
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,500
正确的。
Right.

1005
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,960
不用了，我很好。
Um, no, I'm fine.

1006
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,970
这是--我很抱歉。这是男孩的问题。
It's a-- I'm so sorry. It's boy problems.

1007
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,970
那算不了什么。这太愚蠢了。
It's nothing. It's stupid.

1008
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,600
-哦-是的
-Oh. -Yeah.

1009
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,970
他昨晚确实在这里。
He was actually here last night.

1010
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,240
他和我一起来参加募捐活动，
He came to the fundraiser with me,

1011
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,070
然后不知从哪里冒出来的，你知道，他走了。
and then out of nowhere, he left, you know.

1012
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,110
我一直给他发短信，他都不回我。
And I keep texting him, and he doesn't text me back.

1013
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,640
我不知道。无所谓。
I don't know. It doesn't matter.

1014
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,250
-你好吗？-我很期待这次巡演.
-How are you? -I am so excited for this tour.

1015
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,480
我能快速问你一句吗？
Can I just ask you really quickly?

1016
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,950
因为我真的觉得
Because I actually think

1017
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,550
你就像是最合适的人选。
you're, like, the perfect person to ask.

1018
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,090
怎么一回事？
What is going on?

1019
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,920
你知道，就像，他对我不感兴趣
You know, like, is he not interested in me

1020
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,660
还是真的出了什么事？
or did something really come up?

1021
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,120
为什么我会想这么多呢？
And why am I thinking about it so much?

1022
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,590
这就是最烦人的地方。
That's what's so annoying.

1023
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,530
你知道，因为我从来不会像这样分心，好吗？
You know, because I'm never distracted like this, okay?

1024
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,530
我不是这样的人
This is not who I am.

1025
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,000
就像，我现在该做什么？
And it's like, what do I do now?

1026
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,960
我要再给他发短信吗？我要打电话给他吗？
Do I text him again? Do I call him?

1027
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,530
我要去他家吗，你知道吗？
Do I go to his house, you know?

1028
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,540
我该怎么办，黛布拉？
What do I do, Debra?

1029
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,310
你知道，在过去的25年里，
You know, for the last 25 years,

1030
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,680
我一直在听地球上每一个同性恋的声音
I have been listening to every gay man on earth

1031
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,340
向我投诉吧。
complain to me.

1032
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,580
我不是我的角色。
I am not my character.

1033
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:18,110
我不是每个男同性恋者最好的朋友。
I am not every gay man's best friend.

1034
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:20,550
我只是在外面的世界里，
I am simply out in the world,

1035
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:24,550
以为我要去参观博物馆，但不是。不是的！
thinking that I'm gonna get a tour of a museum, but no. No!

1036
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:28,290
我是不是大摇大摆地进来，把我所有的屎都撒在你身上了？
Did I waltz in here and lay all my shit on you?

1037
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,430
-回答我！回答我，-我只是...
-Answer me! Answer me! -I'm just-- I...

1038
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,560
闭嘴!
Shut up!

1039
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,160
我是一位离异的单身母亲。
I am a divorced single mother.

1040
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,960
你想听听那是什么感觉吗？
You want to hear what that's like?

1041
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,700
对此我很抱歉。我感到非常尴尬。
I'm so sorry about this. I'm terribly embarrassed.

1042
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:39,340
请让我，让我重新开始。我..。
Please let me, let me start again. I...

1043
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,970
嘿，哇。这里发生了什么事？
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wh-What's going on in here?

1044
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:43,210
你有什么私事吗？
Do you have some personal shit

1045
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,640
你想向我抱怨什么吗？
you want to complain to me about?

1046
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,340
-没有。-当然不是.
-No. -Of course not.

1047
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:51,180
因为女同性恋有他们的狗屎在一起。
Because lesbians have their shit together.

1048
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:53,450
我得走了。一小时后我就会失去保姆。
I got to go. I lose my sitter in an hour.

1049
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,290
梅辛小姐，请回来。我太抱歉了。
Miss Messing, please come back. I'm so sorry.

1050
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,420
我不是格蕾丝！
I am not Grace!

1051
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,460
这是一个角色。
It is a character.

1052
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:04,090
我为此赢得了艾美奖。
I won an Emmy for it.

1053
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:06,430
我甚至打败了莎拉·杰西卡·帕克。
I even beat Sarah Jessica Parker.

1054
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,360
人们会忘记！
People forget!

1055
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,330
我在剃光头。
I'm shaving my head.

1056
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:12,470
这他妈的怎么会在这里？
What the fuck is this doing here?

1057
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,670
鲍比！你这是怎么了？
Bobby! What is going on with you?

1058
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,640
黛布拉·梅辛刚刚叫你他妈的滚开。
Debra Messing just told you to fuck off.

1059
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,270
门他妈的锁上了。
The door's fucking locked.

1060
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:21,310
-哦，请让我帮你吧.-没有。我想要她。
-Oh, please let me help you. -No. I want her.

对不起，我还没有回复。
Sorry I haven't replied.

1072

我只是一直很忙。

1073
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:10,530
别担心。一样的。

1074
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:17,400
这个周末你想出去玩吗？
You want to hang out this weekend?

1075
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,740
嘿，鲍比。我必须说实话。

我真的很喜欢和你在一起。
I really like hanging out with you.

1077

你又聪明又风趣，
You're so smart and funny,

1078
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:34,180
但我不确定我是否适合你。
but I'm not sure I'm the right match for you.

1079
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,450
我不确定我有没有达到你的水平。
I'm not sure I'm at your level.

1080
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:40,660
也许你的朋友们说我很无聊是对的。
Maybe your friends were right when they said I was boring.

1081
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,290
祝你一切顺利。

1084
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,710
你为什么坐在草地上
Why are you sitting on the grass

1085
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,550
而不是这张巨大的毯子？
and not this gigantic blanket?

1086
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,650
我喜欢青草。
I like grass.

1087
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:13,460
嗯。凉爽的。凉爽的。

还记得我遇到的那个人吗
Remember that guy I ran into,

1092
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,870
那个高中的老朋友？

1093
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,340
-是的-是的他就这么出来了。
-Yeah. -Yeah. He just came out.

1094
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:31,270
什么？
What?

1095
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:33,210
和他的未婚妻分手了。我不知道。
Broke up with his fiancée. I had no idea.

1096
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,550
-哇.-疯狂.
-Wow. -Crazy.

1097
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,710
-对他来说很好.-是的
-Good for him. -Yeah.

1098

那很酷啊。

非常酷。
Very cool.

1100
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,190
好的，我很抱歉。怎么一回事？
Okay, I'm sorry. What is going on?

1101
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:51,760
-你什么意思？-那天晚上.
-What do you mean? -The other night.

1102
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:53,230
就这样把我丢在博物馆里。
Leaving me at the museum like that.

1103
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,760
然后你没有回我一条短信。
And then you didn't return any of my texts.

1104
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,200
嗯，你给我发了15次短信。
Well, you texted me like 15 times.

1105
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:57,400
有点吓人。
It was a little scary.

1106
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:59,470
好吧，我需要你对我说实话。
Okay, I need you to be honest with me.

1107
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,240
你不会被我吸引，对吧？
You're not attracted to me, right?

1108
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:02,640
没关系的。我能应付得来。
It's okay. I can handle it.

1109
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:03,770
我不会被侮辱的。
I won't be insulted.

1110
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:05,340
我只想知道。
I just need to know.

1111
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,780
跟我说实话，我就不会浪费时间了。
Just be honest with me so I don't waste my time.

1112
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,810
-我不是你喜欢的类型，对吗？-鲍比，不是那样的.
-I'm not your type, right? -Bobby, it's not that.

1113
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:12,550
-你是个很有魅力的人。-好的.好的，谢谢。
-You are a very attractive guy. -Okay. Well, thanks.

1114
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:15,420
那你为什么表现得如此怪异和被动攻击性？
So why are you being so weird and passive-aggressive?

1115
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:17,220
听着，事实上，你声音太大了。
Look, you're being very loud, actually.

00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:37,020
你就像奥斯汀·鲍尔斯。
You're like Austin Powers.

1199
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:39,860
谢谢。
Thank you.

1200
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:43,760
天哪，我从来没想过我会和一个
God, I never thought I would date someone who gets

1201
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:47,800
比起黛布拉·梅辛，奥斯汀·鲍尔斯更让人兴奋。
more excited about Austin Powers than Debra Messing.

1202
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:50,500
我哪里做错了？
Where did I go wrong?

1203
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:52,770
等。我们在约会吗？
Wait. Are-are we dating?

1204
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:57,810
不是的。
No.

1205
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,840
我们不是在约会。请。
We're not dating. Please.

1206
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,440
我是在开玩笑。
I was joking.

1207
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,780
你不会和别人约会。我不和人约会。
You don't date people. I don't date people.

1208
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:05,880
我们不和人约会。
We don't date people.

1209
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,450
记得吗-我记得
-Remember? -I remember.

1210
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,760
现在.。你干吗呢？
Ow. What are you doing?

1211
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:28,640
如此令人讨厌的是，一个温暖的身体感觉多么好
So annoying how good a warm body feels

1212
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:31,440
躺在另一具温暖的身体上。
laying on another warm body.

1213
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:46,560
-嗯？-我讨厌在星期天收到工作邮件.
-Hmm? -I hate getting work emails on a Sunday.

1214
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,030
你的工作真的很紧张。
Your job is really intense.

1215
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,430
是的，我讨厌这样。
Yes, and I hate it.

1216
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,530
这他妈的压力很大，也很压抑
It's fucking stressful and depressing

1217
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,240
而且真他妈的无聊。我-我..。
and so fucking boring. I-I...

1218
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:01,040
我真他妈讨厌这样。
I fucking hate it.

1219
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:02,940
对不起。
I'm sorry.

1220
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:06,040
你还有什么想做的吗？
Was there something else you wanted to do?

1221
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:10,910
鲍比，我要告诉你一件事。
Bobby, I need to tell you something.

1222
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,550
我年轻的时候..。
When I was younger...

1223
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,490
发生什么事了-我
-What happened? -I...

1224
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,730
你可以告诉我。
You can tell me.

1225
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,910
当我还小的时候，我想做一些小巧克力。
When I was younger, I wanted to make little chocolates.

1226
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:42,210
你想要做..。
You wanted to make...

1227
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,780
-要点巧克力吗？-是的
-little chocolates? -Yes.

1228
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:45,720
我过去常常告诉我父母我要去游乐场
I used to tell my parents I was going to the arcade

1229
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,820
在商场，但我会偷偷溜到Godiva去。
at the mall, but I would sneak off to Godiva.

1230
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:50,750
我就是喜欢所有巧克力的包装。
I just loved how all the chocolates were wrapped.

1231
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:53,120
我想着如何设计我自己的巧克力，
And I thought about how I would design my own chocolates,

1232
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,660
每一块小巧克力都有
how each little chocolate has

1233
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:56,730
它自己独特的设计，
its own specific, unique design on it,

1234
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,030
这个小小的设计告诉你
and that little design tells you

1235
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,700
它们会是什么味道。
what they're gonna taste like.

1236
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:04,100
所以我会在记事本上画我自己的巧克力。
So I would draw my own chocolates in-in a notepad.

1237
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:05,740
我满脑子想的都是这个。
It's all I thought about.

1238
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:08,170
小小的漂亮巧克力。
Tiny little pretty chocolates.

1239
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:09,870
那很好。
That's good.

1240
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:12,010
不过，我能用它做什么呢？
What was I gonna do with that, though?

1241
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,910
我会变成什么样子？
What was I gonna be?

1242
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:16,750
巧克力机？
A chocolatier?

1243
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,680
鲍比，我不想当他妈的巧克力师。
Bobby, I wasn't gonna be a fucking chocolatier.

1244
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,750
我不知道。为什么不行？
I don't know. Why not?

1245
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,550
这看起来有点像同性恋。
It seemed kind of faggy.

1246
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:26,090
哦，天哪，亚伦。
Oh, my God, Aaron.

1247
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,320
基佬？
Faggy?

1248
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,260
把你的一生都花在这一点上
It's not faggy to spend your life

1249
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:30,760
做着漂亮的小巧克力。
making pretty little chocolates.

1250
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:32,630
-鲍比.-好的，好的.
-Bobby. -Okay, fine.

1251
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,630
但那又如何？所以你是个大基佬。
But so what? So you're a big fag.

1252
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:35,930
我也是。太棒了。
So am I. It's great.

1253
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:37,830
你几分钟前没意识到吗
Did you not realize that a few minutes ago

1254
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:39,870
当你把你巨大的阴茎
when you were sticking your enormous penis

1255
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,970
-放进我的小肛门？-好的，好的.
- into my tiny anus? - Okay, yeah.

1256
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:44,040
这有点老生常谈了，你不觉得吗？
It-It's kind of cliché, don't you think?

1257
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:47,780
我宁可老生常谈，也不愿变得悲惨。
I'd rather be a cliché than be miserable.

1258
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:49,780
嗯，1995年我15岁的大脑--
Well, my 15-year-old brain in 1995--

1259
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:52,080
这就是我所想的一切。
that is all I thought about.

1260
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,190
那正好是在那个时候
That was right around the time

1261
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,320
我哥哥抓到了我。
that my brother caught me.

1262
00:50:56,350 --> 00:50:57,690
-和一个男人勾搭上了？-没有.
-Hooking up with a guy? -No.

1263
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,090
不，我在做小巧克力。
No, I was making little chocolates.

1264
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,960
噢。
Oh.

1265
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:04,960
我撒谎了，我说我是...
I lied, and I said that I was...

1266
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:06,800
给这个女孩做巧克力
making chocolates for this girl

1267
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,800
这是我在学校时迷恋的。
that I had a crush on at school.

1268
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:09,930
对不起。
I'm sorry.

1269
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:12,040
这是我听过的最可爱的事。
This is the cutest thing I've ever heard.

1270
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:14,340
我猜你只是过着精彩刺激的生活。
I guess you just have this big, exciting life.

1271
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:18,870
我只是不想让你觉得我是个无聊的笨蛋。
I just didn't want you to think that I was some boring schlub.

1272
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,640
我不觉得你很无聊。
I don't think you're boring.

1273
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,310
你的朋友说我很无聊。
Your friend said I was boring.

1274
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:26,650
天哪。你对此很生气？
Oh, my God. You were mad about that?

1275
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,220
我是在开玩笑。对不起。
I was joking. I'm sorry.

1276
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:30,950
但是，好像，我不明白。
But, like, I don't understand.

1277
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:33,020
你不必整天呆在那间可怜的办公室里。
You don't have to be stuck in that miserable office all day.

1278
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,660
你可能在外面的世界，我不知道，
You could be out in the world, I don't know,

1279
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:37,690
做软糖，你知道吗？
making fudge, you know?

1280
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:40,230
你就像一个内心有同性恋恐惧症的Keebler精灵。
You're like a Keebler elf with internalized homophobia.

1281
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,630
你必须这么做。
You have to do this.

1282
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,030
你必须成为一个巧克力师。
You have to become a chocolatier.

1283
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:45,300
-哦，鲍比.-你必须成为一个巧克力师。
-Oh, Bobby. -You have to become a chocolatier.

1284
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:46,400
我告诉你。
I'm telling you.

1285
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,010
你说得太容易了。
You make that sound so easy.

1286
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,710
嗯，不，这并不容易。
Well, no, it's not easy.

1287
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,840
没有什么是容易的。
Nothing's easy.

1288
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,150
天哪。你知道我这个周末要做什么吗？
My God. You know what I have to do this weekend?

1289
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:57,110
我不得不拖着我凹陷的胸膛
I have to drag my concave chest

1290
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:59,180
去普罗文斯敦向捐赠者乞讨钱财。
up to Provincetown and beg donors for money.

1291
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:02,920
我需要500万美元，否则博物馆就不能开放了。
I need $5 million or else the museum can't open.

1292
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:05,720
上面是Pride，所以博物馆必须有
And it's Pride up there, so the museum has to have

1293
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:07,690
游行队伍中的一辆花车，这是一件完整的事情。
a float in the parade, and that's a whole thing.

1294
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,760
我告诉你，这并不容易。
I'm telling you, it is not easy.

1295
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:12,160
这从来不是一件容易的事。
It is never easy.

1296
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:16,200
但这是值得的。
But it's worth it.

1297
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:19,700
嘿，也许我可以去。
Hey, maybe I can come.

1298
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:23,210
去哪里？
To where?

1299
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,770
普罗文斯敦？
Provincetown?

1300
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,110
噢。
Oh.

1301
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:29,410
嗯。
Yeah.

1302
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:39,790
来吧，来吧，来吧。欢迎。我是路易斯。
Come, come, come. Welcome. I'm Louis.

1303
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:41,390
让我带你看看你的卧室。
Let me show you your bedroom.

1304
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:42,890
谢谢。天哪。
Thank you. Oh, my God.

1305
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,760
-这房子太漂亮了。-哦
-This house is so beautiful. -Oh.

1306
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:46,200
你住这个地方多久了？
How long have you had this place?

1307
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:49,300
哦，我从1976年就开始来P镇了。
Oh, I've been coming up to P-town since, uh, 1976.

1308
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:51,070
-哇.-这些人都是谁？
-Wow. -Who are all these guys?

1309
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,770
哦，好吧，呃，实际上，那就是我。
Oh, well, um, actually, that's me.

1310
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,770
天哪。
Oh, my God.

1311
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,410
路易，你太火辣了。
Louis, you were so hot.

1312
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,180
-是的，我知道.-哇.
-Yeah, I know. -Wow.

1313
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:01,140
这些人中还有人还在这上面吗？
Do any of these guys still come up here, too?

1314
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:02,780
呃，没有。
Uh, no.

1315
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:06,220
到1996年，这七个人中有四个已经消失了。
By 1996, four of the seven of them were gone.

1316
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:09,490
我在1999年得到了这个地方，当我意识到不知何故，
I got this place in 1999 when I realized that somehow,

1317
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,490
奇迹般地，我活了下来。
miraculously, I was gonna survive.

1318
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,990
哦，我很抱歉。
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1319
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,090
那么，告诉我。你们今天在忙什么呢？
So, tell me. What are you boys up to today?

1320
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:17,460
哦，好吧，今天下午我有工作上的事，
Oh, well, I have a work thing this afternoon,

1321
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:19,060
所以我也不是很清楚。
so I don't really know.

1322
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,160
-可能只是低调行事.-低调行事？
-Probably just lay low. -Lay low?

1323
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,470
你在P镇。
You're in P-town.

1324
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,070
出去。玩得开心。
Go out. Have fun.

1325
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,040
你很快就会死的。赶快。
You'll be dead soon enough. Come on.

1326
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:28,440
-让我带您去您的房间。-好的.
- Let me show you to your room. - All right.

1327
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:29,810
这是你的卧室。
Here's your bedroom.

1328
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,470
天哪!
Oh, my God!

1329
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:33,780
哦，哇。
Oh, wow.

1330
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:35,780
如果你想操，就告诉我。
And if you want to fuck, you let me know.

1331
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:38,810
-哦嗯。-嗯.
-Oh. Mm. -Mm.

1332
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,350
嘿，我要去拿点东西。哦，见鬼。
Hey, I need to grab something. Oh, shit.

1333
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:44,490
-鲍比.-我很抱歉.
-Bobby. -I'm sorry.

1334
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,990
你为什么就这么走进来？
Why are you just walking in here?

1335
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,490
对不起。我还以为你在洗澡呢。
I'm sorry. I thought you were in the shower.

1336
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,960
这不是类固醇。这只是睾丸素。
It's not steroids. It's just testosterone.

1337
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:51,760
是不是很危险，就像，
Isn't that dangerous, like,

1338
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:53,030
给你的肝脏和蛋蛋之类的东西？
for your liver and balls and stuff?

1339
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,270
不是的。我认识的人中有一半会做这种事。
No. Half the guys I know do this stuff.

1340
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:58,240
是啊，但你认识的人中有一半都是被开除的笨蛋。
Yeah, but half the guys you know are roided-out morons.

1341
00:53:58,270 --> 00:53:59,970
是啊，好吧，看起来你并不介意
Yeah, well, that doesn't seem to bother you

1342
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,210
当你对我的身体着迷的时候。
when you're obsessing over my body.

1343
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:08,180
好的，这很公平。
Okay, that's fair.

1344
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:10,050
呃，我要去洗个澡。
Um, I'm gonna shower.

1345
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:14,450
♪她带走了我的心♪
♪ She's taken my heart ♪

1346
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:19,390

1353
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:48,220
你的声音真的很好听。
You have a really nice voice.

1354
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:49,420
什么？
What?

1355
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:50,820
我听到你在淋浴时唱歌。
I heard you singing in the shower.

1356
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:53,060
好吧，那太令人羞愧了。
Well, that's mortifying.

1357
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:55,060
等等，所以你是在要求这个人捐献
Wait, so you're asking this guy to donate

1358
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:56,890
剩下的五百万呢？
the remaining five million?

1359
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:59,360
不是的。如果我能从他那里得到一百万，我就买下它。
No. If I can get one million out of him, I'll take it.

1360
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,030
你不能因为看起来太穷就把这些人吓跑了。
You can't scare these people off by seeming too needy.

1361
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:04,870
有点像和你在一起。
Kind of like with you.

1362
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:07,200
谁是劳伦斯·葡萄-拉里·葡萄
-Who's Lawrence Grape? -Larry Grape.

1363
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,210
地球上最大的同性恋电视制片人。
Biggest gay TV producer on the planet.

1364
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,470
他创造了所有这些突破性的同性恋内容。
He's made all this groundbreaking queer content.

1365
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:13,340
他是少校。
He's major.

1366
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,880
葡萄先生，我在想
Mr. Grape, I'm thinking

1367
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:16,450
最后一翼应该是关于林肯的。
the final wing should be about Lincoln.

1368
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,450
我喜欢这一点。我爱林肯。
Love that. Love Lincoln.

1369
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,350
很少有人知道这一点，
Very few people know this,

1370
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:21,480
但我们最受欢迎的总统
but our most popular president

1371
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,850
也是我们第一位同性恋总统。
was also our first gay president.

1372
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:24,450
抱歉的。这是林肯博物馆吗？
Sorry. This is a Lincoln museum?

1373
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:26,260
这是林肯博物馆吗，先生？
Is this a Lincoln museum, sir?

1374
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:29,130
这实际上是一座LGBTQ历史博物馆。
This is actually an LGBTQ history museum.

1375
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,930
这是第一次在全国范围内进行此类活动。
It's the first of its kind on a national level.

1376
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:31,960
我们实际上是...
We actually s...

1377
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:34,230
那个该死的灌木丛！赶快。
That fucking bush! Come on.

1378
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:35,960
我的邻居种下了那棵灌木丛，挡住了我的视线。
My neighbors planted that bush, and it blocks my view.

1379
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,230
你能相信吗？
Can you believe that?

1380
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,240
我们去处理这件事吧。
Let's go take care of this.

1381
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,470
哦，又是这个？你干吗呢？
Oh, again with this? What are you doing?

1382
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:43,640
这是我的地盘，莫里斯！
This is on my property, Maurice!

1383
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:45,340
这是一条共享的边界！
This is a shared borderline!

1384
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:47,310
这是一场他妈的灾难。他连我的话都不听。
This is a fucking disaster. He won't even listen to me.

1385
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:49,150
他忙着让他的罗威纳犬为Pride做好准备。
He's too busy getting his rottweiler ready for Pride.

1386
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:51,310
好吧，从我在工作中的经验来看，
Okay, from my experience at my job,

1387
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:53,580
奇怪的有钱人只想被倾听。
weird rich people just want to be listened to.

1388
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,220
问问他对什么感兴趣。
Ask him what he's interested in.

1389
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:56,520
但我不在乎他对什么感兴趣。
But I don't care what he's interested in.

1390
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:58,120
我是来向他推销我的想法的。
I'm here to pitch him my idea.

1391
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:00,290
那就假装你很感兴趣。
Well, then pretend like you're interested.

1392
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,490
做个倾听的表情。
Just do a listening face.

1393
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,530
-做个倾听的表情？-是的
-Do a listening face? -Yeah.

1394
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,530
嗯。嗯。
Hmm. Yeah.

1395
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,600
-我做不到-是的赶快。去。
- I can't. - Yes. Come on. Go.

1396
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:10,270
好吧。
Okay.

1397
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,400
-是的。是的，那很好。-真的？
-Yes. Yeah, that's good. -Really?

1398
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,570
看起来像是我在听吗？
That looked like I'm listening?

1399
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,640
-完全是.嗯。-哦
-Totally. Yeah. -Oh.

1400
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:17,170
...把这个种在我的土地上！
...plant this on my property!

1401
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:19,010
-这是土著灌木丛！-你要去Pride吗？
-It's an indigenous bush! -Are you going to Pride?

1402
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,210
-当然。-我会在那里等你。
-Of course. -I'll see you there.

1403
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,110
-爱你.-哦，我也爱你
-Love you. -Oh, I love you, too.

1404
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:24,150
好的。听着呢。我要试一试。我要试一试。
All right. Listening. I'll try it. I'll try it.

1405
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:25,550
抱歉的。我得走了，伙计们。
Sorry. I have to get going, boys.

1406
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,420
哦，葡萄先生，让我问你一件事。
Oh, Mr. Grape, let me ask you something.

1407
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,650
嗯.。
Um...

1408
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:34,920
你想在博物馆里看什么？
what would you like to see in the museum?

1409
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:38,290
闹鬼的房子
A haunted house

1410
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:40,630
同性恋精神创伤。
of gay trauma.

1411
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,300
同性恋精神创伤的鬼屋？
A haunted house of gay trauma?

1412
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:44,700
嗯。这是一辆在轨道上的手推车，还有...
Yeah. It's a cart on a track, and there's...

1413
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:46,940
对不起。这是顺风车吗？
I'm sorry. This is a ride?

1414
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,970
是啊，这是他妈的顺风车！
Yeah, it's a fucking ride!

1415
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:51,070
所以你觉得搭便车太多了？
So you think a ride is too much?

1416
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:54,010
呃，不。不-不是。
Um, no. N-No.

1417
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:57,050
不，不。太完美了。请继续往前走。
No, no, no, no. It's perfect. Please, keep going.

1418
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,020
好吧。我们发现自己身处
Okay. We find ourselves in

1419
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:02,420
一家私密的小酒吧，有一些年轻的，
an intimate little bar with some young,

1420
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:04,250
性感动漫的男人。
hot, animatronic men.

1421
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:06,690
男人们转过身来互相跳舞，突然--砰！
The men turn to dance with each other when suddenly-- Boom!

1422
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:07,990
哦，我的.
Oh, my...

1423
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,560
一辆警车撞穿了墙。
A cop car smashes through the wall.

1424
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:11,390
警察从车里冲出来。
Police storm out of the cars.

1425
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:14,200
警报声、警棍声和尖叫声响起。
There's sirens and batons and voices screaming.

1426
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,100
突然，汽车像过山车一样起飞了，
And suddenly, the car takes off like a roller coaster,

1427
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:17,570
到处都是血。
and there's blood everywhere.

1428
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:21,100
一个上面有里根面孔的怪物在追你
And a monster with Reagan's face on it is chasing you

1429
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:23,070
走廊上写着，“山上闪耀的城市。
down the hallway saying, "Shining city on a hill.

1430
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:24,440
山上闪耀的城市。“
Shining city on a hill."

1431
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:26,480
然后.。我们向光中射击。
And then... we shoot out into the light.

1432
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:28,280
它以一些快乐的事情结束
And it ends on something happy

1433
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:31,450
就像Lil Nas X和粉色哑铃一起锻炼。
like Lil Nas X working out with pink dumbbells.

1434
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:34,450
哇。
Wow.

1435
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,020
嗯，一个同性恋创伤杯垫。
Um, a gay trauma coaster.

1436
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:39,460
我-我是说，这-这很挑衅。
I-I mean, it's-it's very provocative.

1437
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:40,760
我只是觉得我们负担不起
I just don't think we can afford

1438
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,460
不幸的是，这类事情。
that sort of thing, unfortunately.

1439
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:44,690
正确的。好吧，好吧，很高兴见到你……
Right. Well, okay, it was so lovely meeting you g...

1440
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:47,130
葡萄先生，葡萄先生。
Mr. Grape, Mr. Grape.

1441
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,730
我不是一个有创意的人。我是个爱赚钱的人。
I'm not a creative guy. I'm a money guy.

1442
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:50,400
-不，不，不-我--不，不.
-No, no, no, no, no, no. -I-- No, no.

1443
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:53,070
我可以告诉你，为了实现你想要的，
I can tell you, to accomplish what you want,

1444
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,170
我们需要的不仅仅是一笔小小的捐赠。
we need more than just a little donation.

1445
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:58,210
-不，亚伦...-我们需要500万美元.
-No, Aaron... -We need $5 million.

1446
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,210
而且你不会只得到同性恋创伤杯垫。
And you won't just get the gay trauma coaster.

1447
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,280
你得到了林肯展览。你得到了所有的东西。
You get the Lincoln exhibit. You get all of it.

1448
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:08,320
你改写了整个LGBTQ社区的历史。
You rewrite history for an entire LGBTQ community.

1449
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:13,320
你是个讲故事的人，劳伦斯，这就是终极故事。
You're a storyteller, Lawrence, and this is the ultimate story.

1450
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:17,790
你已经两次推迟博物馆开放了。
You already pushed the museum opening back twice.

1451
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:19,360
这真的发生了吗？
Is it really happening?

1452
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,430
是!这肯定会发生的。我保证。
Yes! It's definitely happening. I promise.

1453
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,800
我的整个人生都导致了这一点。
My entire life has led up to this.

1454
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:27,100
好吧，好吧，500万美元不算什么
Right, well, $5 million is nothing

1455
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:28,340
改写历史。
to rewrite history.

1456
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:29,370
我加入。
I'm in.

1457
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:30,810
等等，真的吗？
Wait, really?

1458
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,280
-是的！太棒了！-哦，天哪！葡萄先生，谢谢你！
-Yes! Yes! -Oh, my God! Mr. Grape, thank you!

1459
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:34,510
当然了。
Of course.

1460
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:37,150
祝贺我赚到钱了。骄傲快乐。
Congratulations on my money. Happy Pride.

1461
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,720
-骄傲快乐！-现在我得走了
-Happy Pride! -Now I have to go

1462
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:42,320
去参加一个骄傲派对，而且你们都太老了，不适合在泳池里。
to a Pride party, and you're both too old to be in the pool.

1463
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:43,520
请离开吧。
Please leave.

1464
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:48,530
亚伦！天哪!
Aaron! Oh, my God!

1465
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,090
你真是个天才。
You're a genius.

1466
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:51,430
“你是个讲故事的人”？
"You're a storyteller"?

1467
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:53,100
-这是从哪里来的？-我告诉过你.
-Where did that even come from? -I told you.

1468
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:54,360
我很擅长和奇怪的有钱人交谈。
I'm good at talking to weird rich folk.

1469
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,200
我看得出他有钱可花。
I could tell he had money to spend.

1470
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:57,830
我-我不知道该说什么。
I-I don't know what to say.

1471
00:58:57,870 --> 00:58:59,240
谢谢。
Thank you.

1472
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:00,670
好的。
Sure.

1473
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:02,440
天哪。
Oh, my God.

1474
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:04,110
哦，妈的！我得去参加游行了。
Oh, shit! I got to go to the parade.

1475
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,340
我得登上那辆愚蠢的花车。
I got to get on that stupid float.

1476
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:07,440
-待会儿见.-好的.
-I'll see you after. -Okay.

1477
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,380
好吧。谢谢。
Okay. Thank you.

1478
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,320
好吧。
Okay.

1479
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,490
我吻了你！
I kissed you!

1480
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,860
我们现在是在接吻吗？我不知道!再见!
Are we kissing each other now? I don't know! Bye!

1481
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:37,070
鲍比！
Bobby!

1482
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:13,240
你太美了。
You're gorgeous.

1483
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,110
什么？你才是。
What? You are.

1484
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:21,480
我还是不敢相信你今天对劳伦斯做了什么。
I still can't believe what you did with Lawrence today.

1485
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,520
太神奇了！
That was amazing!

1486
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:25,220
500万美元？
$5 million?

1487
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:26,820
这没什么大不了的。
It's not that big a deal.

1488
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:29,530
这是一件大事。你在开我的玩笑吗？
It is a huge deal. Are you kidding me?

1489
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:32,200
我总是要为自己做所有的事。
I always have to do everything for myself.

1490
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:34,500
从来没有人为我做过那样的狗屎。
No one ever does shit like that for me.

1491
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:37,830
你知道，你为我做的事你也可以为你自己做。
You know, what you did for me you could do for yourself.

1492
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:39,840
开一家巧克力店。我不知道。
Open a chocolate shop. I don't know.

1493
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:42,640
我不会开巧克力店的。
I'm not opening a chocolate shop.

1494
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:44,940
我没有你那么自信。
I'm not as confident as you.

1495
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:47,240
哦，别这样。我没那么自信。
Oh, please. I'm not that confident.

1496
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,710
你是我认识的最自信的人，
You are the most confident person I know,

1497
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:51,650
就像，到了一定程度。
like, to a fault.

1498
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:52,850
这实际上是--
It's actually--

1499
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,520
这有点吓人。
It's kind of scary.

1500
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:59,220
相信我，这都是在演戏。
Trust me, it's all an act.

1501
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:01,220
自信只是你做出的一个选择。
Confidence is just a choice you make.

1502
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:02,930
这是一个和其他任何决定一样的决定。
It's a decision like any other.

1503
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,360
通常是出于需要而生的。
Usually born out of necessity.

1504
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:08,330
你觉得我现在有一副好嗓子吗？
You think I have a good singing voice now?

1505
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,200
你应该在我还是个孩子的时候听我的。
You should have heard me when I was a kid.

1506
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:11,470
我做得更好。
I was even better.

1507
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,270
如果《美国偶像》当时还存在，
Had American Idol existed then,

1508
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:14,870
我就会成为那个声音很棒的同性恋
I would've been the gay guy with an amazing voice

1509
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,240
谁名列第二。
who comes in second.

1510
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:18,270
然后让我们来看看。
And then let's see.

1511
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:23,580
然后我上了大学，我的音乐剧老师--
Then I went to college, and my musical theater teacher--

1512
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:25,880
他告诉我，我有一次“同性恋漫步”
he told me that I had a "gay walk"

1513
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,950
以及“华丽的品质”，这会“限制我的选择”。
and a "flamboyant quality" which would "limit my options."

1514
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,720
然后为了读研究生，我去了
And then for grad school, I went to

1515
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,790
全国最好的新闻学院之一，
one of the best journalism schools in the country,

1516
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:38,430
我的老师在那里，
and my teacher there,

1517
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:40,860
这位老而隐秘的女王娶了一个女人，
this old, closeted queen who was married to a woman,

1518
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:44,600
把我拉到一边，以为他是在帮我的忙
pulled me aside and thought he was doing me a favor

1519
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:46,600
当他告诉我我应该坚持写作时
when he told me that I should stick to writing

1520
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,710
因为我的声音听起来太同性恋了，不适合在电视上做新闻。
because my voice sounded too gay to do the news on TV.

1521
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,670
真实的故事。
True story.

1522
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:54,980
然后我坚持写作和我的同性恋历史书籍。
And then I did stick to writing and my gay history books.

1523
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:58,310
每一家出版商，每一家，
Every single publisher, every single one,

1524
01:01:58,350 --> 01:02:01,450
告诉我它没有足够的观众。
told me there wasn't enough of an audience for it.

1525
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,990
我总是太同性恋，或者我太小众了，
I was always too gay, or I was too niche,

1526
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:06,860
或者，你知道，我让人们感到不舒服。
or, you know, I made people uncomfortable.

1527
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:10,990
即使是我的父亲，他是那么的好和支持--
Even my dad, who was so wonderful and supportive--

1528
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:14,330
我记得他说，“你知道，不是每个人
I remember him saying, "You know, not everyone

1529
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:17,570
一直想听同性恋的话。“
wants to hear this gay stuff all the time."

1530
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,870
但我该怎么做呢？
But what was I supposed to do?

1531
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:23,470
我是说..。我是个作家。
I mean... I'm a writer.

1532
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:28,710
我想写我的生活，我的朋友，我的世界。
I wanted to write about my life, my friends, my world.

1533
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:31,650
我告诉你，
And I'm telling you,

1534
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,520
有足够多的人告诉你这样的事情，
enough people tell you things like that,

1535
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:36,350
不管你有多自信，
no matter how confident you are,

1536
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:38,350
当你晚上一个人的时候，
when you're alone at night,

1537
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:41,390
你开始想，也许他们是对的。
you start to think that maybe they're right.

1538
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:48,070
所以..。我只是.。
So... I just...

1539
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:50,570
我低下头，
I put my head down,

1540
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,340
我只是非常努力地工作，
and I just worked really hard,

1541
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:56,670
我只是希望能以某种方式
and I just hoped that somehow

1542
01:02:56,710 --> 01:03:00,740
其他人都错了。
all these other people were wrong.

1543
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,720
他们就是这样。
And they were.

1544
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:18,490
他们就是这样。
And they were.

1545
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:24,800
我是说，我花了很多年
I mean, I spent years

1546
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:29,410
看着一群平庸的异性恋男人从我身边走过。
watching a wave of mediocre straight men passing me by.

1547
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,710
有一半天赋的人，他们工作也只有一半努力，
Men with half the talent, who worked half as hard,

1548
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:34,380
他们并不像我那样在意，
who didn't care as much as I did,

1549
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:36,480
而且他们总是走两倍的路。
and they got twice as far, always.

1550
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:38,410
我是说，这已经是老生常谈了，但是...
I mean, that's an old story, but...

1551
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:41,750
然后，你知道，这个世界追上了我们。
And, you know, the world caught up with us.

1552
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:44,790
追得还不够快。
Didn't catch up fast enough.

1553
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:48,960
追得还不够快，我父母看不到
Didn't catch up fast enough for my parents to see

1554
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:51,960
所有这些伟大的事情都发生在我身上。
all these great things happen for me.

1555
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:53,600
对吗？
Right?

1556
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:57,370
对很多人来说还不够快。
Didn't catch up fast enough for a lot of people.

1557
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,900
这是事实。
That's the truth.

1558
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:04,110
让我告诉你，自信就是知道
Let me tell you, confidence is just knowing

1559
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:06,440
你是唯一一个你可以依靠的人。
you're the only person left you can count on.

1560
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,410
这就是全部。
That's all that is.

1561
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,910
就这样。
That's all.

1562
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:16,420
再来一杯啤酒吗？
Want another beer?

1563
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:20,660
好的。
Sure.

1564
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:31,070
抱歉的。那真是太多了。
Sorry. That was a lot.

1565
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:32,670
是不是让你觉得很奇怪？
Did that weird you out?

1566
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:36,970

我告诉乔什·埃文斯我们会去见他
I told Josh Evans we would meet him

1731
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:30,080
在霍尔哈特圣诞电影快闪村。
at the Hallheart Christmas movie pop-up village.

1732
01:12:30,110 --> 01:12:31,610
我们要去见乔什·埃文斯？
We're seeing Josh Evans?

1733
01:12:31,650 --> 01:12:33,950
我怎么不知道。
I didn't know.

1734
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:34,920
那，我们做吧。
Let's do it.

1735
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:36,620
你是哈勒哈特的粉丝吗？
Are you a Hallheart fan?

1736
01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:38,360
我涉猎过。
I dabble.

1737
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:43,630
这太美了。
This is so beautiful.

1738
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:45,160
我知道呀。我爱死它了。
I know. I love it.

1739
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:46,200
那是乔什。
There's Josh.

1740
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:48,500
冬天穿短裤，就像个彻头彻尾的神经病。
Wearing shorts in winter, like a total psychopath.

1741
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:49,900
哦，我的天。
Oh, my goodness.

1742
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:54,500
他们有瑞秋·雷可食用的金属丝！
They have Rachael Ray edible tinsel!

1743
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:57,070
-乔什！埃文斯！-嘿，伙计们。
- Josh! Evans! - Hey, fellas.

1744
01:12:57,110 --> 01:12:59,210
-霍尔哈特村对你怎么样？-嗨
-How's Hallheart Village treating ya? -Hey.

1745
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,980
你看过他们拍的那部同性恋电影吗？
Did you see the gay movie that they did?

1746
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:02,380
这是一种毒品。
It was kind of dope.

1747
01:13:02,410 --> 01:13:04,250
是啊，多年来他们不理我们，
Yeah, for years they ignored us,

1748
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:05,980
然后他们的观众对同性恋的恐惧感降低了10%，
then their audience got 10% less homophobic,

1749
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:07,380
所以他们决定我们是一个新的人口群体
so they decided we're a new demographic

1750
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:09,520
他们可以把狗屎卖给。我是说，看看这些电影。
they can sell shit to. I mean, look at these movies.

1751
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:12,220
祝你自己过一个异性恋的小圣诞节。
Have Yourself A Heteronormative Little Christmas.

- I mean, it's absurd. - Josh.

1755
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:21,260
-嘿.-圣诞快乐。

1756
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:22,400
快来拿溜冰鞋。

1757
01:13:22,430 --> 01:13:24,000
我想见你和亚伦
I want to see you and Aaron

1758
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:26,270
看在老天的份上回到冰上吧。

1759
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:27,140
嗯。
Yeah.

1760
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:29,010
鲍比、乔什和亚伦
Bobby, Josh and Aaron

1761
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,710
高中时一起打曲棍球。

1762
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:32,110
-哦，我知道-是的
-Oh, I know. -Yeah.

1763
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:34,280
-来吧.-嘿，伙计，怎么了？
-Come on. -Hey, man, what's going on?

1764
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:37,010
-伙计，你有什么问题？-什么？
-Dude, what is your problem? -What?

1765
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:39,150
你能不能，比如，把音调调低一点？
Could you just, like, maybe tone it down a notch?

1766
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:40,980
对不起，我不明白。
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

1767
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:42,620
我们已经和我父母待了两个小时了，
We've been with my parents for two hours,

1768
01:13:42,650 --> 01:13:44,550
你已经谈过变性人体模型了，
and you've already talked about transgender mannequins,

1769
01:13:44,590 --> 01:13:46,220
预防艾滋病毒，
HIV prevention,

1770
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:48,430
你指出了通往1976年堤坝游行的路线。
and you pointed out the route to the 1976 Dyke March.

1771
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:50,960
他们玩得很开心。他们都很好。
They're having fun. They're totally fine.

1772
01:13:50,990 --> 01:13:52,300
你有什么问题？
What is your problem?

1773
01:13:52,330 --> 01:13:53,430
我很紧张，好吗？
I'm nervous, okay?

1774
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:55,060
我从来没有把他们介绍给任何人。
I've never introduced them to anybody.

1775
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:56,500
我只是不想让他们觉得奇怪。
I just don't want them to get weirded out.

1776
01:13:56,530 --> 01:13:59,670
我想让他们过上一段凉爽的、正常的时光。
I want them to have, like, a chill, normal time.

1777
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:01,440
所以现在我不正常了？
So now I'm not normal?

1778
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:02,970
鲍比，你知道我的意思。
Bobby, you know what I mean.

1779
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:05,210
我只是在做我自己。
I'm just being myself.

1780
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,210
好吧，但也许你可以，就像，
Okay, but maybe you could just be, like,

1781
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:10,450
在三个小时内少做点自己。
a little less yourself for like three hours.

1782
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,280
我想让他们喜欢你。

1783
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:16,020
噢。嗯。
Oh. Yeah.

1784
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:17,620
不，当然可以。当然了。
No, sure. Of course.

1785
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:19,060
好的，我就..。
Yeah, I'll just...

1786
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:21,120
我还是安静点好了。
I'll just be quiet.

1787
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:23,260
好的谢谢。
Okay, thank you.

1788
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:25,200
鲍比！天哪!
Bobby! Oh, my God!

1789
01:14:25,230 --> 01:14:26,500
嗨!
Hi!

1790
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:28,260
-嗨！-天哪.
-Hi! -Jesus Christ.

1791
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:30,200
不管怎样，我们都得走了。我们预订了晚餐。
We have to go anyway. We have a dinner reservation.

1792
01:14:30,230 --> 01:14:31,770
晚餐在哪来着？
Where's dinner again?

1793
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:35,710
♪我在飞行♪

1794
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:37,170
♪看着我，高高在上的♪

1795

1796
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,680
♪，我飞起来了。♪

1797
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:50,750
嘿，爸爸，北极熊队怎么样了？
Hey, Dad, how are the Polar Bears doing?

1798
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:52,490
这就是我和乔什曾经效力的球队。
That's the team Josh and I used to play on.

1799
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,320
他们一整年都没赢过。
They haven't won all year.

1800
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,360
我告诉乔什他们需要你们回来。
I told Josh they need you boys to come back.

1801
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:02,100
鲍比，你今晚看起来很安静。
Bobby, you seem quiet tonight.

1802
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:03,370
一切都还好吗？

1803
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:06,140
哦，是的，我很好。嗯。
Oh, yeah, I'm totally fine. Yeah.

1804
01:15:06,170 --> 01:15:07,570
我其实--你知道，我很抱歉
I'm actually-- You know, I'm sorry

1805
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,140
如果我今天说得太多的话。

1806
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:10,770
我只是--我想我有点紧张了。
I just-- I think I got nervous.

1807
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:12,780
这其实更像是我平时的样子
This is actually more like how I usually am.

1808
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:14,310
我很安静。
I'm very quiet.

1809
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:17,150
非常安静，就像，奇怪的正常。

1810
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:19,220
好的，再次感谢
Well, thanks again

1811
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:21,250
为我计划了这么美好的一天。
for planning such a lovely day.

1812
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:23,190
哦，不客气，谢泼德太太。
Oh, you're so welcome, Mrs. Shepard.

1813
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:25,050
哦，你听起来像我的一个学生。
Oh, you sound like one of my students.

1814
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:26,690
叫我安妮吧。

1815

嗯，好吧。
Okay, I will.

1816
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,830
呃，妈妈一直是二年级的老师
Uh, Mom's been a second grade teacher

1817
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:31,260
已经有近40年了。

1818
01:15:31,290 --> 01:15:33,160
哦，天哪，太棒了。
Oh, my God, that's amazing.

1819
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:35,060
我们现在比以往任何时候都更需要好老师。

1820
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:37,800
谢谢。我同意。

1821
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:42,570
亚伦说你在美国历史博物馆工作。
And Aaron says you're working at an American history museum.

1822
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:46,280
是。是的，是这样的。
Yes. Yes, it is.

1823
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:48,210
这是一座美国历史博物馆。
It's an American history museum.

1824
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:49,450
嗯。
Hmm.

1825
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:51,280
嗯-嗯。
Mm-hmm.

1826
01:15:51,310 --> 01:15:53,720
这实际上是一座LGBTQ历史博物馆。
Well, it's actually an LGBTQ history museum.

1827
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:56,420
这是美国第一个大型同性恋历史博物馆。
It's the first major queer history museum in America.

1828
01:15:56,450 --> 01:15:58,190
你教过你的学生任何同性恋史吗？
Do you teach your students any gay history?

1829
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,620
因为我知道在几个州
'Cause I know in a few states

1830
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:01,320
他们终于开始这么做了。
they're finally starting to do it.

1831
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:06,300
嗯，我教二年级，所以不是。
Well, I teach second grade, so no.

1832
01:16:06,330 --> 01:16:07,560
哦，对了。
Oh, right.

1833
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,630
不，我明白。嗯。
No, I understand. Yeah.

1834
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:15,610
出于好奇，为什么不呢？
Out of curiosity, why not?

1835
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,710
嗯，我只是觉得
Well, I just think

1836
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:19,780
他们太年轻了，不能这么做。
they're a little young for that.

1837
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:21,680
哦，当然可以。嗯。
Oh, of course. Yeah.

1838
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:24,080
不，我明白。
No, I understand that.

1839
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,320
不过，我不这么认为。
I don't think so, though.

1840
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:30,290
-啊，鲍比.-不，我只是说说
-Ah, Bobby. -No, no, no, I'm just saying.

1841
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,590
恕我直言，我不同意。
If I may disagree respectfully.

1842
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:33,820
那实际上是最好的时机
That's actually the best time

1843
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:35,390
当他们还小的时候，教他们。
to teach them, when they're young.

1844
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:37,330
你知道，这样他们就会产生一种欣赏
You know, that way they develop an appreciation

1845
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,900
在同性恋们开始互相欺负之前
for queer people before they all start bullying each other

1846
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:40,800
或者如果他们是同性恋就恨他们自己。
or hating themselves if they're gay.

1847
01:16:40,830 --> 01:16:42,600
也许你是对的。
Maybe you're right.

1848
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:44,500
噢。
Oh.

1849
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:48,570
不过，感觉有点年轻。
Feels a little young, though.

1850
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:50,470
嗯。正确的。
Hmm. Right.

1851
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:52,280
完全没问题。我懂了。
Totally. I get it.

1852
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:54,740
-我会放弃的。--是的。
- I will drop it. --Yeah.

1853
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:55,810
-同意不同意。-是的
-Agree to disagree. -Yeah.

1854
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:57,510
-为此干杯。-是的。
-Cheers to that. -Yes.

1855
01:16:57,550 --> 01:17:00,180
嘿，那么，呃，你们什么时候回家……
Hey, so, uh, when are you guys heading home...

1856
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:01,620
不过，它并不是真的那么年轻。
It's not really that young, though.

1857
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:03,150
它不是那么年轻。
It's not that young.

1858
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:04,620
鲍比，你能不能别说了？
Bobby, can you please drop it?

1859
01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:06,920
不，我不能，因为我们在谈论同性恋孩子，
No, I can't, because we're talking about gay kids here,

1860
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,360
这很重要。
and it's important.

1861
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:09,760
救了我的一件事是
One of the things that saved me is that

1862
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:12,400
当我还是个孩子的时候，我的父母让我接触到了同性恋故事。
my parents exposed me to gay stories when I was a kid.

1863
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:14,560
当我12岁的时候--这是真的--
When I was 12 years old-- this is true--

1864
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,630
我父母带我去看了一场百老汇戏剧
my parents took me to see a Broadway play

1865
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:18,170
叫做爱与同情。
called Love and Compassion.

1866
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,500
是关于一群男同性恋者的
It was about a group of gay men

1867
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:21,500
一起在普罗文斯敦度过夏天。
spending the summer together in Provincetown.

1868
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:23,510
突然，帷幕拉开了，
And all of a sudden, the curtain goes up,

1869
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:27,240
舞台上有七个全裸的男同性恋者。
and there are seven completely naked gay men onstage.

1870
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:30,380
我坐在那里，坐在我爸妈之间
And there I am, sitting between my mom and dad

1871
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:34,220
在12岁的时候，看着七个柔软的阴茎。
at age 12, looking at seven soft penises.

1872
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:36,390
-见鬼.-突然之间，
- Shit. - And all of a sudden,

1873
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:37,920
两个男人开始亲热，
two of the guys start making out,

1874
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:39,790
然后他们中的一个开始说脏话，你知道吗？
and then one of them starts, like, talking dirty, you know?

1875
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:41,560
我对此记忆犹新。
And I remember this so vividly.

1876
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:43,530
有一场性爱场面，其中一个男人说，
There was a sex scene, and one of the guys is like,

1877
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:46,430
“拍我的前列腺，拍我的前列腺。”
"Pound my prostate. Pound my prostate."

1878
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:47,930
你知道的，“给我挤奶，给我挤奶。”
You know, "Milk me. Milk me."

1879
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,670
我甚至都不知道那是什么。
And I didn't even know what that was.

1880
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:51,400
我是说，现在我知道了。
I mean, now I do.

1881
01:17:51,430 --> 01:17:52,940
但是，你知道，这太不可思议了。
But, you know, it was incredible.

1882
01:17:52,970 --> 01:17:54,800
你知道，知道我可以坐在那里，
You know, to know that I could sit there,

1883
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:58,310
在我妈妈和爸爸之间，看着七个阴茎。
between my mom and dad, looking at seven penises.

1884
01:17:58,340 --> 01:17:59,810
七个阴茎，安妮。
Seven penises, Anne.

1885
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,480
我那时12岁。
I was 12.

1886
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:03,850
我是说，要知道他们对此并不介意，
And to know that they were okay with that, I mean,

1887
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,420
这对我产生了深远的影响。
that had a profound effect on me.

1888
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:07,350
我要说的是，我们需要消除耻辱
All I'm saying is, we need to remove the stigma

1889
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:08,850
从这种事情中解脱出来，所以同性恋孩子
from that type of thing so that gay kids

1890
01:18:08,890 --> 01:18:10,820
都能自我感觉良好。这就是我要说的。
can feel good about themselves. That's all I'm saying.

1891
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:12,960
我是说，看看亚伦，他有多讨厌自己的生活。
I mean, look at Aaron and how much he hates his life.

1892
01:18:12,990 --> 01:18:14,990
-鲍比.-不，我想说的是
-Bobby. -No, all I'm saying is there's

1893
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:16,560
与你的不快乐程度直接相关的是
a direct correlation between how unhappy you are

1894
01:18:16,590 --> 01:18:18,230
用你的生活和你没有学到的东西
with your life and what you weren't taught

1895
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:19,300
关于你小时候的潜力。
about your potential as a child.

1896
01:18:19,330 --> 01:18:20,430
鲍比，别说了。
Bobby, stop talking.

1897
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:21,800
-什.-说真的，够了.
-Wh... -Seriously, enough.

1898
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:23,300
我要把你杀了。
I will kill you.

1899
01:18:23,330 --> 01:18:25,840
亚伦，你讨厌你的生活吗？
Aaron, you hate your life?

我要在那家酒吧和他见面。

Oh, really? You want to talk more?

1916
01:19:00,370 --> 01:19:01,840
我觉得这比和乔什去派对好多了
Well, I think it's better than going to party with Josh,

1917
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:03,510
那个花了40年才出来的自怨自艾的笨蛋。
the self-loathing meathead who took 40 years to come out.

1918
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:04,840
是啊，不是每个人都是你，鲍比。
Yeah, well, not everybody's you, Bobby.

1919
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:06,440
好吧，但是40年？
Okay, but 40 years?

1920
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:07,740
J·R·R·托尔金在旅途中花费的时间更少。
J.R.R. Tolkien took less time with his journey.

1921
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:10,680
天啊，你真他妈的无情。
God, you are fucking relentless.

1922
01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:12,520
“亚伦讨厌他的生活”？
"Aaron hates his life"?

1923
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:14,480
神。
God.

1924
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:16,790
嘿。
Hey.

1925

1929
01:19:48,090 --> 01:19:49,650
啊，伙计。不是的。
Ah, dude. No.

1930
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:51,390
嘿，吻我就行了。
Hey, just kiss me.

1931
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:58,860
亚伦。
Aaron.

1932
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,460
哦，嘿，鲍勃。
Oh, hey, Bob.

1933
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:02,800
见鬼，鲍比，我们只是闹着玩。
Uh, shit, Bobby, we were just playing around.

1934
01:20:02,830 --> 01:20:04,930
-这-这是...-你只是在开玩笑？
-It's-it's... -You were just playing around?

1935
01:20:04,970 --> 01:20:06,400
你他妈的怎么了？
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1936
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,740
-鲍比，鲍比.-乔什，离开.-我很抱歉.
-Bobby, Bobby. -Josh, leave. -I'm sorry.

1937
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:10,440
他妈的给我滚出去！
Get the fuck out of here!

1938
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:12,480
-鲍比，冷静点.-天哪，我就知道
-Bobby, calm down. -Oh, my God, I knew it.

1939
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:14,110
他妈的我就知道。
I fucking knew it.

1940
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:15,480
说出来就行了。
Just say it.

1941
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:16,950
你就不能直接说出来吗？
Can you please just say it?

1942
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:20,380
最后，他妈的说出来吧，因为我已经知道了。
Finally, just fucking say it, because I already know.

1943
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:22,950
-你对我不感兴趣。-什么？
-You're not attracted to me. -What?

1944
01:20:22,990 --> 01:20:26,090
我看到了你看到的那些人，在健身房和俱乐部。
I see the guys you look at, at the gym and the club.

1945
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:28,030
到处都是！无论我们走到哪里！
Everywhere! Everywhere we go!

1946
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:29,690
-好的，鲍比...-去陪他吧
-Okay, Bobby... -Go be with him

1947
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:31,530
如果这是你想要的，但我不会让你
if that's what you want, but I will not let you

1948
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:32,830
-再把我拖下水.-这不是...
- drag me into this any further. - It's not...

1949
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:34,100
我不会让你伤了我的心。
And I will not let you break my heart.

1950
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:35,600
我太聪明了，不会那么做的！
I am too smart for that!

1951
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:37,030
鲍比，你为什么要说我的坏话
Bobby, why did you say that shit about me

1952
01:20:37,070 --> 01:20:38,470
在我父母面前？
in front of my parents?

1953
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,970
我求过你不要让我难堪，
I begged you not to embarrass me,

1954
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,370
但你控制不了自己。
but you couldn't help yourself.

1955
01:20:43,470 --> 01:20:45,440
你是怎么了？
What is wrong with you?

1956
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:49,410
我做错什么事了？
What is wrong with me?

1957
01:20:49,450 --> 01:20:51,150
“小声点，鲍比。”
"Tone it down, Bobby."

1958
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:52,820
“安静点，鲍比。”
"Be quiet, Bobby."

1959
01:20:52,850 --> 01:20:55,480
“你就不能少一点你自己吗？
"Can't you be a little bit less of yourself,

1960
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:56,750
就几个小时？“
just for a few hours?"

1961
01:20:57,750 --> 01:21:00,720
你以为我不知道那是什么意思吗？
You don't think I know what that means?

1962
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:02,790
你以为我不知道这是什么意思吗？
You don't think I know what that's code for?

1963
01:21:02,830 --> 01:21:04,530
你以为我没听说过吗？
You don't think I've been hearing that

1964
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,760
我他妈的整个人生？
my whole fucking life?

1965
01:21:08,170 --> 01:21:10,470
这就是你对我的看法？
That's what you think about me?

1966
01:21:12,670 --> 01:21:15,810
我不是在为自己道歉。我会把这事留给你。
I'm not apologizing for myself. I will leave that to you.

1967
01:21:36,790 --> 01:21:38,560
嘿，问你个问题，因为你认识所有人。
Hey, question for you because you know everyone.

1968
01:21:38,590 --> 01:21:39,760
我需要改头换面。

1969

哦，是啊。我们周末去泡温泉吧。
Ooh, yeah. Let's go to a spa weekend.

1970
01:21:42,070 --> 01:21:43,500
不，我想要类固醇，或者，
No, I want steroids or, like,

1971
01:21:43,530 --> 01:21:44,830
睾丸激素或者HGH之类的。
testosterone or HGH or something.

1972
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:46,640
我一直在锻炼，但我没有变得更大。
I keep working out, but I don't get bigger.

1973
01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:48,210
我想看起来像个他妈的动作明星。
I want to look like a fucking action star.

1974
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:49,770
忘了普罗文斯敦吧。我想让人们认为
Forget Provincetown. I want people to think

1975
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:51,610
我有一份关于Jumanji的夏季分享。
I have a summer share on Jumanji.

1976
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,610
我受够了做小众。我想成为雷神。
I'm sick of being niche. I want to be Thor.

1977
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:55,610
鲍比，你知道类固醇
Bobby, you know that steroids

1978
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:56,680
不会让你自己变大，对吧？
don't make you big on their own, right?

1979
01:21:56,710 --> 01:21:58,080
就像，你还得锻炼身体
Like, you still have to work out

1980
01:21:58,120 --> 01:21:59,580
-你不能错过这个窗口。-我知道！
-and you can't miss the window. -I know!

1981
01:22:03,950 --> 01:22:06,920
我们他妈的走吧。
Let's fucking go.

1982
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,090
现在.。
Ow.

不是的。
No.

1984
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,230
操!
Fuck!

1985
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:17,770
不是的！你干吗呢？!
No! What are you doing?!

1986
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,540
-住手！-鲍比！鲍比！
- Stop that! - Bobby! Bobby!

1987
01:22:19,570 --> 01:22:21,070
-林肯展览被取消。-为什么？
-The Lincoln exhibit is canceled. -Why?

1988
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:22,610
人们威胁要抵制。
People are threatening a boycott.

1989
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:23,940
他们正在撤回他们的捐款。
They're pulling their donations.

1990
01:22:23,970 --> 01:22:24,940
只是没有足够的证据。
There's just not enough proof.

1991
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:26,540
好吧。
Okay.

1992
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:28,510
你想把林肯放回壁橱里吗？很好!
You want to put Lincoln back in the closet? Fine!

1993
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:29,980
-我会把他放回壁橱里！-鲍比.
-I'll put him back in the closet! -Bobby.

1994
01:22:30,010 --> 01:22:32,220
-我要把他放回他妈的壁橱里！-鲍比.
-I'll put him back in the fucking closet! -Bobby.

1995
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:33,180
这里!
Here!

1996
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:34,950
这就对了！
There you go!

1997
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:37,850
林肯回到了你们都需要他的壁橱里！
Lincoln is back in the closet where you all need him to be!

1998
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:39,160
我在吃类固醇！
I'm on steroids!

1999
01:22:39,190 --> 01:22:40,190
好了，鲍比，冷静点。
Okay, Bobby, just calm down.

2000
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:42,230
所以，安吉拉和我向她求婚
So, Angela and I have proposed

2001
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:44,790
最终的展览被命名为“后同性恋”。
that the final exhibit be called "Post-Gay."

2002
01:22:44,830 --> 01:22:45,730
后同性恋时代？
Post-Gay?

2003
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:48,860
是的，因为当同性恋已经是老生常谈了。
Yes, because just being gay is old news.

2004
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:51,030
好吧，所以，现在我对艾伦来说太同性恋了，
Okay, so, now I'm too gay for Aaron,

2005
01:22:51,070 --> 01:22:52,500
但我对你来说太直了？
but I'm too straight for you?

2006
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:54,740
有谁能告诉我
Will somebody please tell me

2007
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:57,270
我到底该有多同性恋？！
exactly how gay I'm supposed to be?!

2008
01:22:57,310 --> 01:22:59,710
可怜的亚伯拉罕·林肯现在连同性恋都不能当了？！
Poor Abraham Lincoln can't even be gay now?!

2009
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:01,280
因为他不是同性恋，鲍比。
Because he wasn't gay, Bobby.

2010
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:03,780
-他是双性恋，而我...-好了，够了！
- He was bi, and I have... - Okay, enough!

2011
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:05,880
你想摆脱我们的故事吗？很好!
You want to get rid of our stories? Fine!

2012
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,950
让我们除掉他们吧！
Let's get rid of them!

2013
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:09,550
我有狂暴的情绪！
I have roid rage!

2014
01:23:09,590 --> 01:23:11,790
你疯了吗?
Are you insane?

2015
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:14,890
-鲍比...-好的，再见，巴蒂吉格！
-Bobby... -Yeah, bye-bye, Buttigieg!

2016
01:23:15,930 --> 01:23:17,030
-别说了，鲍比.-不！
-Stop it, Bobby. -No!

2017
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:19,060
-鲍比！-给--不！
-Bobby! -Give-- No!

2018
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:20,560
把它给我！
Give it to me!

2019
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,600
-把旗子放下！-不！把它给我！
-Put the flag down! -No! Give it to me!

2020
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:24,930
把它给……
Give it to...

2021
01:23:24,970 --> 01:23:27,270
安吉拉和拉拉，按住他。
Angela and the lesbians, hold him down.

2022
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:29,870
不是的！
No!

2023
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:32,680
-你在服用类固醇？-你看不出来.
-You're on steroids? -You can't tell.

2024
01:23:32,710 --> 01:23:34,940
你猜怎么着？我不需要这些狗屎。
You know what? I don't need this shit.

2025
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:36,010
我也是。
Me neither.

2026
01:23:36,050 --> 01:23:37,750
拉拉们，散开！
Lesbians, disperse!

2027
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,050
我讨厌博物馆，
I hate the museum,

2028
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:43,920
但最重要的是，我真的很讨厌讲故事。
but most of all, I really fucking hate storytelling.

2029
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,320
她不喜欢讲故事。
She doesn't like telling stories.

2030
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:48,720
也许最后一翼应该是
Maybe the final wing should be

2031
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:50,960
人们可以去的空荡荡的大房间
a big empty room where people can go

2032
01:23:50,990 --> 01:23:52,800
他妈的给我闭嘴！
to just shut the fuck up!

2033
01:23:52,830 --> 01:23:54,130
好吧。嗯。
Okay. Yeah.

2034
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:56,230
快走！诸位!
Leave! All of you!

2035
01:23:56,270 --> 01:23:57,930
哦，见鬼，我的窗户。
Oh, shit, my window.

2036
01:23:57,970 --> 01:23:59,870
我的健身窗口！
My workout window!

2037
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:22,190
♪放下低音。♪
♪ Drop the bass. ♪

2038
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:32,000
嘿，兄弟。
Hey, bro.

2039
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:34,340
-嘿，兄弟.怎么了？-怎么了？
-Hey, bro. What's up? -What's up?

Hey, can you help me with this set, bro?

2043
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:42,810
好的，当然，兄弟。嗯。
Yeah, sure, bro. Yeah.

2044
01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:44,580
好的。
Nice.

2045
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:47,380
-你在做胸部手术？-是的。
-You doing chest? -Yep.

2046
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:49,750
-今天是我的腿日，兄弟.-哦，很好.
-Leg day for me, bro. -Oh, nice.

2047
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:51,250
我得好好练练你的裤腿了。
Got to work on those hammies.

2048
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:52,320
嗯。
Yeah.

2049
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:53,690
去把它们都穿上。
Go put them all on.

2050
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:55,130
今天做一个超集。
Doing a superset today.

2051
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:56,260
-哦，超级套装？-是的.
-Oh, superset? -Yeah.

2052
01:24:56,290 --> 01:24:57,890
是啊，超级套装。
Yeah, superset.

2053
01:24:57,930 --> 01:24:58,760
收工吧，兄弟。
Pack it up, bro.

2054
01:24:58,790 --> 01:25:00,230
-很多盘子。-是的
-Lots of plates. -Yeah.

2055
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:01,900
我还没见过这么多车牌呢
I haven't seen this many plates

2056
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:04,300
因为，呃，犹太人的节日，兄弟。
since, uh, the Jewish holidays, bro.

2057
01:25:04,330 --> 01:25:06,000
-很好，很好-是的
-Nice, nice. -Yeah.

2058
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:10,140
我们应该找个时间再聚一聚。
We should hang out again sometime.

2059
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:11,370
或者去看场比赛？
Maybe watch a game?

2060
01:25:11,410 --> 01:25:12,640
好的，我很乐意。
Yeah, I'd love that.

2061
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:13,980
我给你我的电话号码。
I'll give you my number.

2062
01:25:14,010 --> 01:25:16,150
我靠，伙计。你的声音怎么了？
Holy shit, dude. What happened to your voice?

2063
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:17,250
哦，操。
Oh, fuck.

2064
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,950
嗯，好吧，我真的很抱歉。
Um, okay, I'm really sorry.

2065
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:22,920
但是，我知道这很奇怪，
But, um-- I know this is very strange,

2066
01:25:22,950 --> 01:25:25,650
但当我-我，当我在健身房走向你，
but when I-I, when I walked up to you in the gym,

2067
01:25:25,690 --> 01:25:27,860
我-我只是做了这个声音，你知道吗？
I-I just did this voice, you know?

2068
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:29,060
就像，你知道，就像，
Like, you know, like,

2069
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:30,390
“嘿，兄弟。怎么了？”
"Hey, bro. What's up?"

2070
01:25:30,430 --> 01:25:31,390
我-我不知道。
I-I don't know.

2071
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:32,760
我只是在试一试。
I just was trying it.

2072
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,130
妈的，你是连环杀手吗？
Holy shit, are you a serial killer?

2073
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:36,000
你他妈的现在要杀一个兄弟吗？
Are you gonna fucking kill a bro right now?

2074
01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:37,970
不，不，不。我不会杀兄弟的。我太抱歉了。
No, no, no. I'm not killing a bro. I'm so sorry.

2075
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,800
不，这很奇怪。对不起。我会去的。
No, this is weird. I'm sorry. I'll go.

2076
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,670
是啊，你现在就得离开。
Yeah, you need to leave right now.

2077
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:42,870
但还是挺管用的，对吧？
But it kind of worked, right?

2078
01:25:42,910 --> 01:25:44,010
就像，这就是奇怪的地方...
Like, that's what's weird about it...

2079
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:44,910
伙计，快点，伙计。
Dude, hurry up, man.

2080
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:46,410
我知道，但事实是我就像，
I know, but just the fact that I was like,

2081
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:47,840
“嘿，兄弟。怎么了？”
"Hey, bro. What's up?"

2082
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:48,680
好了，我要走了。
Okay, I'm leaving.

2083
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:50,010
我太抱歉了。
I'm so sorry.

2084
01:25:50,050 --> 01:25:51,750
我现在正经历着一段非常艰难的时期。
I'm going through a very hard time right now.

2085
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:53,280
-我并没有要求你这么做.-好的.
-I ain't ask for all that. -Okay.

2086
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,320
对不起。我要走了。我要走了。
I'm sorry. I'm going. I'm going.

2087
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:57,090
不过，我能问你一件事吗？
Can I just ask you one thing, though?

2088
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:00,460
如果我走到你面前用我真实的声音，
If I had come up to you and used my real voice,

2089
01:26:00,490 --> 01:26:02,260
你会被我吸引吗？
would you have been attracted to me?

2090
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:03,760
哇。
Wow.

2091
01:26:03,790 --> 01:26:06,700
这真的很令人难过但是..。
That is really sad, but...

2092
01:26:06,730 --> 01:26:08,900
是的，我想是的。
Yeah, I think so.

2093
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:10,230
噢。
Oh.

2094
01:26:10,270 --> 01:26:11,900
但不是现在。
But not now.

2095
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:14,400
好吧。
Okay.

2096
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:15,940
我真的很抱歉。
I'm really sorry.

2097
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:23,050
史翠珊？-当然
-Streisand? -Of course.

2098
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:23,950
我爱她。
I love her.

2099
01:26:23,980 --> 01:26:26,480
她是最棒的-史翠珊他妈的规则。
-She's the best. -Streisand fucking rules.

2100
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:29,120
如果你仔细想想，这实际上有点像Yentl。
This is actually kind of like Yentl, if you think about it.

2101
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:31,820
-伙计，他妈的滚出去！-我很抱歉
-Dude, get the fuck out! -I'm so sorry.

2102
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:34,720
后来。
Later.

2103
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:36,390
抱歉的。
Sorry.

2104
01:26:36,430 --> 01:26:38,760
现在，霍尔哈特自豪地向大家介绍
And now, Hallheart proudly presents

2105
01:26:38,790 --> 01:26:41,400
我们的第一部一夫多妻制假日电影，
our first polyamorous holiday film,

2106
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:43,200
一个冬青树，保利的圣诞节。
A Holly, Poly Christmas.

2107
01:26:43,230 --> 01:26:45,500
看，正在下雪。
Look, it's snowing.

2108
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:48,340
我们七个人都在下雪。
It's snowing on all seven of us.

2109
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:50,210
哦，伙计。
Oh, man.

2110
01:27:06,790 --> 01:27:08,720
嘿。
Hey.

2111
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:10,730
嘿。
Hey.

2112
01:27:12,030 --> 01:27:13,260
我们能谈谈吗？
Can we talk?

2113
01:27:14,530 --> 01:27:16,270
好吧。
Okay.

2114
01:27:22,410 --> 01:27:24,170
那么，怎么了？
So, what's up?

2115
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:28,380
鲍比，我很抱歉我告诉你不要做你自己。
Bobby, I am so sorry I told you not to be yourself.

2116
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:31,380
我知道我搞砸了，但这对我来说也是新的。
I know I fucked up, but this is new for me, too.

2117
01:27:31,410 --> 01:27:35,050
当你在我父母面前爆炸的时候，老实说，这...
And when you blew up in front of my parents, honestly, it...

2118
01:27:36,590 --> 01:27:39,090
...感觉你是故意这么做的。
...it felt like you were doing it on purpose.

2119
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:41,320
我曾经是。
I was.

2120
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:42,960
我很抱歉。
And I'm sorry.

2121
01:27:42,990 --> 01:27:46,330
我不该那样处理的。你是对的。
I shouldn't have handled it like that. You're right.

2122
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:48,300
对不起。
I'm sorry.

2123
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:52,500
但是，亚伦
But, Aaron,

2124
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:55,310
但这并不能改变这样一个事实
that doesn't change the fact that

2125
01:27:55,340 --> 01:27:57,410
你喜欢某种类型的男人。
you like a certain type of guy.

2126
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:00,780
那不是我，这没关系。
And that isn't me, and that's okay.

2127
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:04,550
你是对的。
You're right.

2128
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:07,480
我总是想象自己和一个男人在一起。
I always pictured myself with a guy...

2129
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,250
-就像乔什.-是啊，像乔什这样的人.
-Like Josh. -Yeah, a guy like Josh.

2130
01:28:09,290 --> 01:28:11,150
是啊，他很性感。
Yeah, he's hot.

2131
01:28:11,190 --> 01:28:13,290
是的，他简单、传统、基本得像地狱
Yes, he's simple, conventional, basic as hell

2132
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:15,920
而不是真正让我开心的人。
and not somebody that actually makes me happy.

2133
01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:19,560
鲍比，你和我太不一样了。
Bobby, you are so different from me.

2134
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,430
你不怕在世界上占有一席之地。
You're not afraid to take up space in the world.

2135
01:28:22,470 --> 01:28:23,970
你挑战我。
You challenge me.

2136
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,970
一开始，我被吓到了
Which at first, it freaked me out

2137
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,340
因为谁他妈的想一直被挑战？
because who the fuck wants to be challenged all the time?

2138
01:28:29,370 --> 01:28:30,940
但是..。
But...

2139
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:35,380
但我喜欢它。
But I love it.

2140
01:28:36,950 --> 01:28:38,420
你就是一直缺失的人。
You're what's been missing.

2141
01:28:38,450 --> 01:28:41,950
我知道我搞砸了，但请再给我一次机会。
I know I fucked up, but please give me another chance.

2142
01:28:41,980 --> 01:28:43,850
我非常想念你。
I miss you so much.

2143
01:28:43,890 --> 01:28:46,090
我也很想你。
I miss you, too.

2144
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:50,090
很多。
A lot.

2145
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,300
直到我们分手后我才意识到
I didn't realize until after we broke up

2146
01:28:53,330 --> 01:28:56,970
实际上我在那里待了几个月……
there were actually a couple of months there where I was...

2147
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,440
他们怎么称呼它来着？
What do they call it?

2148
01:28:59,470 --> 01:29:01,240
心情很好。
In a good mood.

2149
01:29:16,690 --> 01:29:18,250
可是，我不会呀。
But I can't.

2150
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:25,300
在我的一生中，我一直为自己的自我意识而自豪
My whole life, I have prided myself on being self-aware

2151
01:29:25,330 --> 01:29:28,370
自力更生，镇定自若，
and self-reliant and self-possessed,

2152
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,970
但这无关紧要。
and it didn't matter.

2153
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,040
这并不重要，因为在一天结束时，
It didn't matter because, at the end of the day,

2154
01:29:33,070 --> 01:29:34,940
我就这样在街上结束了
I just ended up in the street

2155
01:29:34,970 --> 01:29:37,240
看着你，看着乔什
looking at you and looking at Josh

2156
01:29:37,270 --> 01:29:40,380
想着，“我对他来说还不够。”
and thinking, "I'm not enough for him."

2157
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:42,080
我知道，我感觉很糟糕，
I know, and I feel awful,

2158
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:44,380
但不要因为一个错误就把它扔掉！
but do not throw this away because of one mistake!

2159
01:29:44,410 --> 01:29:46,320
你想让我怎么做？
Wh-What do you want me to do?

2160
01:29:46,350 --> 01:29:48,250
说你会再给我一次机会。
Say you'll give me another chance.

2161
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:50,250
我不能那么做。
I can't do that.

2162
01:29:50,290 --> 01:29:51,450
为什么不行？
Why not?

2163
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:54,890
因为我不信任你
'Cause I don't trust you.

2164
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:00,700
我孤身一人这么久，谁知道呢？
I've been alone so long, who knows?

2165
01:30:00,730 --> 01:30:03,000
也许这是我唯一知道的方法。
Maybe that's the only way I know how to be.

2166
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:04,900
我不知道。
I don't know.

2167
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:15,010
我要走了。
I'm going.

2168
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:24,150
好。
It's good.

2169
01:30:24,190 --> 01:30:26,090
嘿!
Hey!

2170
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:31,260
如果你不相信我，也没关系。
If you don't trust me, that's fine.

2171
01:30:32,130 --> 01:30:33,430
但如果出于某种原因，
But if for some reason,

2172
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:35,270
在所有的力量和信心之下，
underneath all that strength and confidence,

2173
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:37,570
你仍然不相信自己足够可爱，
you still don't trust that you are lovable enough,

2174
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:40,600
我就是活生生的证据。
I'm living proof...

2175
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:42,370
你错了。
that you're wrong.

2176
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,570
首先，感谢大家
First of all, thank you all

2177
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:09,570
感谢你让我这么做。
for letting me do this.

2178
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,200
我真的很感激。
I really appreciate it.

2179
01:31:11,230 --> 01:31:12,740
听着，我知道我一直
Look, I know I've been

2180
01:31:12,770 --> 01:31:17,010
显然，他是一个非常愤怒、爱说三道四的人。
a very angry, judgmental person, obviously.

2181
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:18,240
有时愤怒也是好事。
And sometimes anger can be good.

2182
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:19,740
我知道你们都知道，因为，多年来，
I know you all know that because, for years,

2183
01:31:19,780 --> 01:31:21,440
这是我们都需要的燃料，让我们继续前进。
it was the fuel we all needed to keep going.

2184
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:24,150
就在不久前，直来直去的看门人
It wasn't that long ago that the straight gatekeepers

2185
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:26,020
并没有考虑到我们所有人
of the world didn't allow for all of us

2186
01:31:26,050 --> 01:31:27,550
才能真正取得巨大成功。
to really succeed in a big way.

2187
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:30,250
天哪。你们还记得异性恋者吗？
Oh, my God. Do you guys remember straight people?

2188
01:31:30,290 --> 01:31:32,620
是的，他们跑得很好。
Yeah, they had a nice run.

2189
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:35,330
听着，鲍比，我是个黑人变性人，我不需要你
Look, Bobby, I'm a Black trans woman, and I don't need you

2190
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:37,560
来这里给我讲讲关于愤怒的事。
to come here and lecture me about anger.

2191
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:40,160
但我明白。
But I get it.

2192
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:42,400
我满心欢喜
I am brimming

2193
01:31:42,430 --> 01:31:44,170
带着愤怒。
with anger.

2194
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:46,540
如果我只吐出一盎司，
And if I were to let just an ounce of it out,

2195
01:31:46,570 --> 01:31:50,070
我可能会炸死你们每一个人。
I would probably explode and kill every one of you.

2196
01:31:50,110 --> 01:31:52,610
但是，鲍比，我想让你知道一些事情。
But, Bobby, I want you to know something.

2197
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,580
我听着呢。
I hear you.

2198
01:31:54,610 --> 01:31:56,380
我原谅你。
And I forgive you.

2199
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:57,710
是吗？
You do?

2200
01:31:57,750 --> 01:31:59,180
是。
Yes.

2201
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:00,650
听着，这是唯一一个社区
Look, this is the only community

2202
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:02,550
我最喜欢的一件事。
I've ever loved being a part of.

2203
01:32:02,590 --> 01:32:06,590
我们像疯了一样打架，我们一直都是，但是...
And we fight like crazy, and we always have, but...

2204
01:32:08,090 --> 01:32:10,090
...你们是我的人民.
...you're my people.

2205
01:32:11,230 --> 01:32:15,430
我很抱歉我这么粗鲁地对你说话。
And I am so sorry that I was so rude and spoke down to you.

2206
01:32:15,470 --> 01:32:17,430
我应该给你更多的尊重。
I should've shown you much more respect.

2207
01:32:17,470 --> 01:32:20,770
地球上真的没有一群人
There is truly no group of people on earth

2208
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:22,610
我更爱更尊重的人。
that I love and respect more.

2209
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:25,440
好吧，我不会撒谎的。我还是很生气。
Well, I am not going to lie. I am still angry.

2210
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:30,180
但我坚持要进步，不仅仅是为了我们的LGBTQ英雄
But I insist on progress, not just for our LGBTQ heroes

2211
01:32:30,210 --> 01:32:34,280
但对于我们LGBTQ的混蛋来说。
but for our LGBTQ assholes.

2212
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:35,080
就像你一样。
Like you.

2213
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:37,250
谢谢你，罗伯特。
Thank you, Robert.

2214

You're posting this?

2216

你能不能...
Can you please--

不，好吧。嗯。
No, okay. Yeah.

2218
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:47,630
不，你绝对应该把这个贴出来。
No, you should definitely post this.

2219
01:32:47,660 --> 01:32:49,370
一切都应该..。所有的东西都应该贴出来，
Everything should... everything should be posted,

2220
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:51,370
谢谢你教我这一点。

说真的，这就是你要说的？
Seriously, that's all you're gonna say?

2264
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,580
“你要怎么斩首？”
"How do you decapitate?"

2265
01:35:20,620 --> 01:35:22,250
你想让我说什么？你怎么摘掉他们的头？
What do you want me to say? How do you remove their heads?

2266
01:35:22,290 --> 01:35:23,450
比如，“嘿，兄弟，你好吗？
What about, "Hey, bro, how are you doing?

2267
01:35:23,490 --> 01:35:24,750
你还撑得住吗？“
How are you holding up?"

2268
01:35:24,790 --> 01:35:26,960
对不起，兄弟。我们不谈论这些狗屎。
I'm sorry, bro. We don't talk about this shit.

2269
01:35:26,990 --> 01:35:30,290
我-我住在这里是因为我正在离婚，
I'm-I'm crashing here because I'm in the middle of a divorce,

2270
01:35:30,330 --> 01:35:32,430
你一次都没问过我。
and you haven't asked me about it once.

2271
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:34,700
对不起。
I'm sorry.

2272
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:37,930
离婚怎么样了？
So, how's the divorce?

2273
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:40,740
-我不想谈这件事.-好的.
-I don't want to talk about it. -Okay.

2274
01:35:40,770 --> 01:35:42,470
所以..。
So...

2275
01:35:43,770 --> 01:35:45,440
...你怎么了？
...what happened to you?

2276
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:48,750
好吧，你还记得圣诞节的时候爸爸妈妈来了吗？
Okay, you remember at Christmas when Mom and Dad came?

2277
01:35:48,780 --> 01:35:50,680
我让鲍比..。
I asked Bobby to...

2278
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:54,520
我让他把声音调低一点。
I asked him to tone it down.

2279
01:35:55,550 --> 01:35:57,820
我知道呀。我知道呀。我搞砸了。我惊慌失措。
I know. I know. I fucked up. I panicked.

2280
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:01,390
你试过了吗
Did you try

2281
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:03,360
-把他带回来还是...-是的。
-to get him back or... -Yes.

2282
01:36:03,390 --> 01:36:04,490
我是说，鲍比是最棒的，
I mean, Bobby is the best,

2283
01:36:04,530 --> 01:36:06,030
但他是个顽固的狗娘养的。
but he is a stubborn son of a bitch.

2284
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:10,730
你爱这个固执的小婊子吗？
And do you love this stubborn little bitch?

2285
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:19,710
管他呢。完了。
Whatever. It's over.

2286
01:36:19,740 --> 01:36:22,310
鲍比很强壮。他不需要我。
Bobby's strong. He doesn't need me.

2287
01:36:23,010 --> 01:36:24,650
他不需要任何人。
He doesn't need anyone.

2288
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:25,680
♪So Alive♪
♪ So alive ♪

2289
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:28,920
♪喜欢这种感觉，学习它的意义...♪
♪ Loving the feeling, learning the meaning... ♪

2290
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:31,050
嘿，伙计们。是你的女友塔玛拉。
Hey, guys. It's your girl Tamara.

2291
01:36:31,090 --> 01:36:33,060
我们今晚要为LGBT博物馆揭幕。
We're opening the LGBT Museum tonight.

2292
01:36:33,090 --> 01:36:34,720
今晚是我们盛大的开幕式，
Tonight is our grand opening,

2293
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:37,090
我们会玩得很开心的！
and we're gonna have a wonderful time!

2294
01:36:37,130 --> 01:36:38,560
嗯!
Yeah!

2295
01:36:38,590 --> 01:36:40,760
-怎么了？-怎么了？
-What's up? -What's up?

2296
01:36:42,030 --> 01:36:44,800
嗨。我是莱昂纳多·达芬奇。
Hi. I'm Leonardo da Vinci.

2297
01:36:44,830 --> 01:36:46,570
我用我的工作改变了世界
I changed the world with my work

2298
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:49,640
作为一名发明家、科学家和艺术家。
as an inventor, scientist and artist.

2299
01:36:49,670 --> 01:36:53,110
但最重要的是，我可能是双性恋。
But most importantly, I may have been bi.

2300
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:55,680
再见了，亲爱的。
Arrivederci.

2301
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:05,090
恭喜啊。你已经成功进入了奥巴马政府。
Congrats. You've made it to the Obama administration.

2302
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:06,990
但是拐角处的是什么呢？
But what's that around the corner?

2303
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:15,900
好吧，说真的，这地方太棒了。
Okay, seriously, this place is incredible.

2304
01:37:15,930 --> 01:37:18,470
-你开心吗？-我不知道
-Are you happy? -I don't know.

2305
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:19,840
这很奇怪，你知道吗？
It's weird, you know?

2306
01:37:19,870 --> 01:37:22,740
就像，这个地方是我的梦想，然后它就发生了。
Like, this place was my dream, then it happened.

2307
01:37:23,710 --> 01:37:25,510
为什么我不能回答你的问题？
Why can't I answer your question?

2308
01:37:25,540 --> 01:37:28,150
-好的，我能说一件事吗？-可以
-Okay, can I just say one thing? -Yes.

2309
01:37:28,180 --> 01:37:30,110
我知道他做的事是错的，
I know that what he did was wrong,

2310
01:37:30,150 --> 01:37:31,780
但你不必和他的父母争论。
but you didn't have to argue with his parents.

2311
01:37:31,810 --> 01:37:34,080
不过，我确实这么做了。另外，我已经道歉了。
I did, though. Plus, I apologized.

2312
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:35,620
他也道了歉。
And he apologized, too.

2313
01:37:35,650 --> 01:37:37,390
我只是不知道我是否能信任他。
I just don't know if I can trust him.

2314
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:38,990
他搞砸了。人们他妈的搞砸了。
He fucked up. People fuck up.

2315
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:40,460
难道你就没有一部分
Is there no part of you

2316
01:37:40,490 --> 01:37:42,430
想给他第二次机会的人？
that wants to give him a second chance?

2317
01:37:43,430 --> 01:37:45,490
你知道这是什么吗？
You know what it is?

2318
01:37:45,530 --> 01:37:48,070
我只是不想这么想要另一个人。
I just don't want to want someone else this much.

2319
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:49,570
但你知道。
But you do.

2320
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:51,630
爱一个人并不会让你看起来软弱。
It doesn't make you look weak to love someone.

2321
01:37:51,670 --> 01:37:54,040
脆弱并不是疯狂的杀手。
Vulnerability is not a boner killer.

2322
01:37:54,070 --> 01:37:55,870
我了解你。
I know you.

2323
01:37:55,910 --> 01:37:58,010
我知道你有一百万个理由
I know that you've had a million reasons

2324
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:00,010
多年来一直保持警惕。
to keep your guard up all these years.

2325
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:01,510
但外面有很多人
But there are people out there

2326
01:38:01,540 --> 01:38:02,750
值得你放松警惕。
worth letting your guard down for.

2327
01:38:02,780 --> 01:38:06,520
有他在身边和没有他在一起，你更快乐吗？
Were you happier with him or without him?

2328
01:38:06,550 --> 01:38:07,920
这才是真正重要的。
That's all that really matters.

2329
01:38:07,950 --> 01:38:10,090
我能告诉你一件非常尴尬的事吗？
Can I tell you something extremely embarrassing

2330
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:11,720
我只会告诉你？
that I would only tell you?

2331
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:12,920
是。
Yes.

2332
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,030
我写了一首关于他的歌。
I wrote a song about him.

2333
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:17,030
我知道呀!这是唯一一次
I know! That's the only time

2334
01:38:17,060 --> 01:38:18,100
我永远都不会谈论这件事。
I'm ever gonna talk about it.

2335
01:38:18,130 --> 01:38:19,560
我们不是在谈论这件事。
We're not talking about it.

2336
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:21,500
不是我寄的，我也不会寄的。
I didn't send it, and I'm not sending it.

2337
01:38:21,530 --> 01:38:23,570
好吧。很好。
Okay. Fine.

2338
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:26,640
我只是从来没见过你这么开心。
I've just never seen you that happy is all.

2339
01:38:26,670 --> 01:38:28,470
我喜欢看它。
And I love seeing it.

2340
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:31,110
嗨，伙计们。
Hi, guys.

2341
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:33,210
-嗨，甜心.-准备好跳舞了吗？
-Hi, sweetie. -Ready to go dance?

2342
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:34,980
-是的-走吧.
-Yeah. -Let's go.

2343
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:15,790
天啊。他给我发了短信。
Holy shit. He texted me.

2344
01:39:15,820 --> 01:39:17,920
-鲍比给我发短信了！-他说了什么？
-Bobby texted me! -Well, what'd he say?

2345
01:39:17,950 --> 01:39:20,960
他说：“嘿，怎么了？”
He said, "Hey, what's up?"

2346
01:39:20,990 --> 01:39:22,560
“嘿，怎么了？”
"Hey, what's up?"

2347
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:24,060
-操是的，兄弟！-是吗？
-Fuck yeah, bro! -Yeah?

2348
01:39:24,090 --> 01:39:26,100
-这就是我要说的！-是吗？那很好?嗯!
-That's what I'm talking about! -Yeah? That's good? Yeah!

2349
01:39:26,130 --> 01:39:27,560
太棒了！“嘿，怎么了？”
It's great! "Hey, what's up?"

2350
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,700
“嘿，怎么了？”“嘿，怎么了？”
"Hey, what's up?" "Hey, what's up?"

2351
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:31,730
-不，等等.不，等等，等等。-什么？
-No, wait. No, wait, wait. -What?

2352
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:32,870
好的，好的。
Okay, yeah.

2353
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:34,700
不过，我等会再给他回短信，你知道吗？
I-I'm gonna wait to text him back, though, you know?

2354
01:39:34,740 --> 01:39:36,810
啊，见鬼。我得去健身房了。
Ah, shit. I got to get to the gym.

2355
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:39,840
Aaron，你和CrossFit每天都他妈的怎么了？
Aaron, what the fuck is up with you and the CrossFit every day?

2356
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:42,050
上帝啊！你们这些人训练是为了什么？
Jesus! What are you people all training for?

2357
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:43,210
你要去打仗吗？
You going to war?

2358
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:45,180
别玩得太酷了。
Stop playing it so cool.

2359
01:39:45,220 --> 01:39:47,250
去告诉他你的感受。
Just go and tell him how you feel.

2360
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,250
哦，那你呢？那离婚呢？
Oh, what about you? What about divorce?

2361
01:39:49,290 --> 01:39:50,850
让它保持年轻和有趣怎么样？
What about keeping it young and fun?

2362
01:39:50,890 --> 01:39:51,790
哦，管他呢。
Oh, whatever.

2363
01:39:51,820 --> 01:39:53,920
异性恋者--我们是如此固步自封。
Straight people-- we're so set in our ways.

2364
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:56,260
但是同性恋者--你们都是如此--
But gay people-- you guys are all so--

2365
01:39:56,290 --> 01:39:57,530
你太聪明了。
you're so smart.

2366
01:39:57,560 --> 01:39:59,530
你会弄明白的。
You're gonna figure it out.

2367
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:02,670
我的故事不是你的故事。
My story is not your story.

2368
01:40:02,700 --> 01:40:04,730
去写你自己的该死的故事吧。
Go write your own damn story.

2369
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:07,740
-走吧！现在！-好的。嗯。
-Go! Now! -Okay. Yeah.

2370
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:10,670
嘿。
Hey.

2371
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:15,680
“嘿，怎么了？”
"Hey, what's up?"

2372
01:40:15,710 --> 01:40:17,150
-“嘿，怎么了？”耶！-“嘿，怎么了？”
-"Hey, what's up?" Yeah! -"Hey, what's up?"

2373
01:40:38,930 --> 01:40:40,200
-鲍比？-什么事？
-Bobby? -Yeah?

2374
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:42,070
-干杯的时间到了。-好的，很好.
-It's time for the toast. -Okay, great.

2375
01:40:42,110 --> 01:40:43,670
好吧。
Okay.

2376
01:40:52,780 --> 01:40:55,850
建造博物馆最难的部分之一
One of the hardest parts of putting the museum together

2377
01:40:55,890 --> 01:40:59,120
就是弄清楚最终的展品会是什么。
was figuring out what the final exhibit would be.

2378
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:02,830
我们给人们留下的关于我们是谁的信息。
The message we'd leave people with about who we are.

2379
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:06,200
但事实是，我们并不是一体的。
But the truth is we are not one thing.

2380
01:41:06,230 --> 01:41:08,730
我们不是一个铁板一块的团体。
We are not a monolithic group.

2381
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:12,070
我们是最聪明、最自力更生的人
We are some of the smartest and most self-reliant people

2382
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:13,700
你将永远不会遇见。
you will ever meet.

2383
01:41:13,740 --> 01:41:15,310
我们真是太蠢了。
And we are so stupid.

2384
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:18,210
我们现在一团糟。
And we are a total mess.

2385
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:20,710
我们都很棒。
And we are great.

2386
01:41:20,740 --> 01:41:22,950
当然，我们从一开始就存在，
We've been around since the beginning of time, of course,

2387
01:41:22,980 --> 01:41:25,820
然而，我们仍然感觉我们才刚刚开始
and yet it still feels like we're at the very beginning

2388
01:41:25,850 --> 01:41:27,820
能够讲述我们自己的故事。
of being able to tell our own stories.

2389
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:29,950
在很多方面，我认为我们仍然
In many ways, I think we're still

2390
01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:32,020
相互了解，真的。
getting to know each other, really.

2391
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:34,820
现在，我只是个无聊的顺式白人同性恋，
Now, I'm just a boring old cis white gay,

2392
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:36,330
但是.。
but...

2393
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:38,790
我从中学到了一件事
one thing I have learned from

2394
01:41:38,830 --> 01:41:41,830
我的跨性别、双性恋和非二进制家庭是
my trans and bi and nonbinary family is that

2395
01:41:41,860 --> 01:41:45,700
我们所有人的幸福都来自于保持流动性，
happiness for all of us comes from staying fluid,

2396
01:41:45,730 --> 01:41:47,240
对变化保持开放态度。
staying open to change.

2397
01:41:47,270 --> 01:41:50,840
敞开心扉，不只是做你认为的自己
Open to being more than just who you thought you were

2398
01:41:50,870 --> 01:41:53,880
或者比其他人想象的要多。
or more than what other people assume you are.

2399
01:41:53,910 --> 01:41:56,250
所以这是为我们所有人干杯。
So this is a toast to all of us.

2400
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:59,150
我们已经走了很长一段路。
We've come a long way.

2401
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:00,980
而且还有很多人
And there are a lot of people

2402
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:04,850
他应该活得足够久才能在今晚来到这里。
who deserved to live long enough to be here tonight.

2403
01:42:04,890 --> 01:42:08,920
我们在这里，而他们不在。
And we are here, and they are not.

2404
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:12,160
我们非常幸运。
And we are very lucky.

2405
01:42:15,030 --> 01:42:17,070
我们非常幸运。
We are very lucky.

2406
01:42:19,070 --> 01:42:21,100
我没有什么可抱怨的。
I have no complaints.

2407
01:42:29,350 --> 01:42:30,880
嘿。
Hey.

2408
01:42:34,050 --> 01:42:35,450
嘿。
Hey.

2409
01:42:35,490 --> 01:42:37,790
嗯.。
Um...

2410
01:42:39,090 --> 01:42:41,420
抱歉，只是，嗯
Sorry, um-- Just, um--

2411
01:42:41,460 --> 01:42:43,330
还有一件事。抱歉，请稍等。
One more thing. Sorry, hold on.

2412
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:45,200
我会这么做的。那，我们做吧。那，我们做吧。
I'm gonna do it. Let's do it. Let's do it.

2413
01:42:51,430 --> 01:42:53,170
嗨。
Hi.

2414
01:42:57,210 --> 01:42:58,910
所以，嗯，
So, um,

2415
01:42:58,940 --> 01:43:02,080
这是我为今晚写的一个特别的小东西，
this is a little special something I wrote for tonight,

2416
01:43:02,110 --> 01:43:04,750
我没想到我真的会
and I didn't think I would actually have

2417
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:06,450
一个唱这首歌的理由。
a reason to sing it.

2418
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:08,720
我已经很久没有在众人面前唱歌了，
And I haven't sung in front of people in a very long time,

2419
01:43:08,750 --> 01:43:09,850
所以请原谅我。
so forgive me.

2420
01:43:09,890 --> 01:43:11,950
但是，今晚是关于爱的，
But, um, tonight is about love,

2421
01:43:11,990 --> 01:43:14,920
我们见过很多受折磨的同性恋牛仔
and we've seen a lot of tortured gay cowboys

2422
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:17,490
多年来由许多直男演员扮演。
played by a lot of straight actors over the years.

2423
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:22,230
这是一首从一个同性恋牛仔到另一个同性恋牛仔的情歌，
So, this is a love song from one gay cowboy to another,

2424
01:43:22,270 --> 01:43:27,000
灵感来自每个人最喜欢的LGBTQ+图标，
