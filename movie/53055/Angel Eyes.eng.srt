1
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:47,714
You called the dispatcher, right?

2
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:52,722
We've got multiple vehicles,
possible DOAs, multiple injuries.

3
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:58,495
Major accident.
We'll need more ambulances.

4
00:01:58,699 --> 00:02:02,100
All units have been deployed.
I don't have an ETA.

5
00:02:02,302 --> 00:02:05,032
-l need those medics.
-I'll do the best I can.

6
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:07,103
Just get them over here.

7
00:02:08,442 --> 00:02:09,841
Can you hear me?

8
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:12,642
Listen to me.

9
00:02:13,447 --> 00:02:14,812
Listen to me!

10
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:16,944
Look at me.

11
00:02:17,217 --> 00:02:18,707
Look in my eyes.

12
00:02:20,988 --> 00:02:22,683
Can you feel that?

13
00:02:22,923 --> 00:02:25,721
That's my hand. Go on, hold it.

14
00:02:26,493 --> 00:02:28,427
We'll get you out of here.

15
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:30,859
l need some help over here!

16
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,909
lt's okay.

17
00:02:54,588 --> 00:02:58,285
You're safe now, all right?
You'll be okay. Just hang on.

18
00:02:58,525 --> 00:03:00,288
All right? You're doing fine.

19
00:03:24,051 --> 00:03:27,487
Don't let go. Don't let me go.
Stay with me.

20
00:03:28,522 --> 00:03:29,386
Come on!

21
00:03:30,824 --> 00:03:32,621
Stay with me, all right?

22
00:03:35,696 --> 00:03:37,323
Stay with me.

23
00:03:37,764 --> 00:03:38,594
Good.

24
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:41,497
Stay with me.

25
00:04:03,857 --> 00:04:07,953
-What are you doing? That's my car.
-Nothing, l just--

26
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:10,459
-What'd you take?
-l turned off--

27
00:04:10,697 --> 00:04:12,164
Did you take something?

28
00:04:12,366 --> 00:04:16,598
-You take my phone, huh?
-Wake up! Wake up! l helped you.

29
00:04:19,906 --> 00:04:21,237
l helped you.

30
00:04:29,283 --> 00:04:30,409
l'm sorry.

31
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,780
That's the fiirst
question people ask.

32
00:04:36,757 --> 00:04:38,691
Have l ever killed anyone?

33
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,853
So casually, like asking me
what kind of car l drive.

34
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:49,228
Why don't they ever ask
if l ever saved anyone?

35
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:52,495
Have you? Saved anyone, l mean.

36
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:59,111
My mother would argue that
God's the only one that saves.

37
00:05:01,648 --> 00:05:05,812
lt must be pretty exciting, though,
catching bad guys.

38
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,614
ls this all we're gonna talk about?

39
00:05:11,558 --> 00:05:12,820
Look, l'm sorry.

40
00:05:16,396 --> 00:05:18,728
l'm not very good at dating.

41
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:55,426
I take it your date sucked.

42
00:05:56,036 --> 00:05:59,096
l don't need to tell my story
to a stranger.

43
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:02,172
''What do you do, where are you from?''

44
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:08,280
Your problem wasn't that he asked
too many questions.

45
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:12,316
You just didn't want to clean
his little pipes.

46
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:15,750
No, all l wanted
to do was clean his pipes.

47
00:06:15,989 --> 00:06:18,514
The conversation pissed me off.

48
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:23,522
Baby girl, if it's a servicing
you need....

49
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:27,594
Shut the fuck up.

50
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:04,329
We've talked about this every
week for six months.

51
00:07:06,573 --> 00:07:10,441
We've talked about this
a thousand times.

52
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:14,438
Come on. No!

53
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:22,654
l am not having this conversation
with you again. Hang on.

54
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:26,357
None of your goddamn business.
Hang on.

55
00:07:26,993 --> 00:07:28,017
What?

56
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:30,855
Your keys are in the door.

57
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:34,566
Then hang up. l don't care.

58
00:07:36,803 --> 00:07:38,862
You're in 21 5, right?

59
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:41,297
Then fuck you!

60
00:07:41,675 --> 00:07:44,838
Not you. l'm talking to this idiot.

61
00:07:48,915 --> 00:07:51,679
You know what? Don't bother.

62
00:07:57,591 --> 00:07:58,853
Candace.

63
00:07:59,726 --> 00:08:00,715
l'm Catch.

64
00:08:02,295 --> 00:08:03,387
Charlie...

65
00:08:04,798 --> 00:08:08,097
...was just about to go to bed,
weren't you?

66
00:08:09,002 --> 00:08:09,991
Bye.

67
00:08:10,837 --> 00:08:13,305
And l just ordered a pizza...

68
00:08:13,507 --> 00:08:16,237
...so l don't know if you're hungry--

69
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,404
l gotta go.

70
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:26,810
See you around.

71
00:08:41,134 --> 00:08:43,159
l didn't see his van, so....

72
00:08:43,537 --> 00:08:45,129
Yeah, he's not here.

73
00:08:47,274 --> 00:08:48,400
How you doing?

74
00:08:48,942 --> 00:08:49,909
l'm okay.

75
00:08:50,844 --> 00:08:54,439
And Cathy and Larry, Jr.?
l bet he's big now.

76
00:08:54,748 --> 00:08:56,409
He's growing fast.

77
00:08:57,951 --> 00:09:00,943
Does he look like you,
or did he get lucky?

78
00:09:02,088 --> 00:09:06,718
He's got Cathy's looks and my
strength. You should feel his grip.

79
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:10,127
So what's with the cryptic message?

80
00:09:10,363 --> 00:09:13,730
''Call me, we have to talk.''
Sounds like bad news.

81
00:09:15,268 --> 00:09:18,066
Mom and Dad are renewing their vows.

82
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:21,069
Church, priest, the whole thing.

83
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:22,998
Renewing their vows?

84
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:26,309
With a party at the house
afterwards.

85
00:09:26,513 --> 00:09:27,912
Mom wants you to come.

86
00:09:28,682 --> 00:09:29,842
Does he?

87
00:09:30,617 --> 00:09:32,414
We're working on Dad.

88
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,480
Over 10 years,
and he won't let it go--

89
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:40,626
No, Sharon! l won't go
into that hole with you.

90
00:09:40,827 --> 00:09:42,488
l'm over that shit.

91
00:09:45,498 --> 00:09:47,398
You're still scared of him.

92
00:09:53,907 --> 00:09:55,033
You know what?

93
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:58,238
You shouldn't come here
in your uniform.

94
00:09:58,445 --> 00:10:00,913
People will think we're in trouble.

95
00:10:05,218 --> 00:10:07,311
-Nice seeing you too.
-Yeah.

96
00:10:14,327 --> 00:10:15,316
Cocksucker!

97
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,758
Get off of me!

98
00:10:21,668 --> 00:10:23,829
-l'll kill you!
-Shut up!

99
00:10:24,371 --> 00:10:25,497
Motherfuck--

100
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:29,236
l'm gonna bend you over the car,
bitch!

101
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:31,205
-Motherfucker!
-Shut up.

102
00:10:31,444 --> 00:10:34,208
-You're under arrest!
-Fucking bitch!

103
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:39,318
You are a crazy one.
You are a pretty one, senorita!

104
00:10:39,886 --> 00:10:42,582
Those honey-brown eyes-- Fuck you!

105
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:48,485
l'll take you in the back
and do you, baby.

106
00:10:48,695 --> 00:10:50,492
You can suck my dick.

107
00:10:50,964 --> 00:10:55,333
This is 7673. We're bringing in
one for processing.

108
00:10:55,568 --> 00:10:59,095
Look good in that uniform.
Why don't you take it off?

109
00:10:59,305 --> 00:11:02,763
Take my handcuffs off too,
you fucking bitch!

110
00:11:03,276 --> 00:11:05,574
-Just one touch.
-Cut it out.

111
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:10,045
You're gonna bust me!
Give me one sweet touch.

112
00:11:12,886 --> 00:11:13,784
Fuck.

113
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:15,918
Fuck you, faggot.

114
00:11:16,322 --> 00:11:18,415
Smells like bacon in here.

115
00:11:18,892 --> 00:11:21,827
That's not the touch l want, honey!

116
00:11:22,028 --> 00:11:25,293
Sit here.
l ain't got time to babysit you.

117
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:30,367
Put your hand on top of your
head. Turn around. Sit down.

118
00:11:30,937 --> 00:11:32,632
-Sit the fuck down!
-Fuck!

119
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:38,105
Mike, you got another booking sheet?

120
00:11:38,378 --> 00:11:39,936
Fucking bitch!

121
00:11:42,182 --> 00:11:43,513
He needs a rag.

122
00:11:44,117 --> 00:11:46,142
Let me talk to you.

123
00:11:46,352 --> 00:11:49,344
Do we need to have another
conversation?

124
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:52,786
You'd just let him
grab your balls?

125
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:55,526
l saw you plan that in the car.

126
00:11:55,729 --> 00:11:58,220
Just waiting to
do something to him.

127
00:11:58,832 --> 00:12:01,699
lf l was out of line,
put it in a report.

128
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:35,895
l hate the graveyard
shift. lt fucks my system.

129
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:39,538
All the shit you eat
is fucking up your system.

130
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:41,866
l love graveyard. No traffic.

131
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:46,273
Nothing's worse than a 459
crosstown during rush hour.

132
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:49,642
Might as well pull over,
because you're gonna be late.

133
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:52,943
You like graveyard because
you have insomnia.

134
00:12:53,153 --> 00:12:55,178
l know what puts me to sleep.

135
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:59,916
The sound of your own voice?
That puts your wife to sleep.

136
00:13:48,942 --> 00:13:51,376
Get down! Down! Heads down!

137
00:13:55,682 --> 00:13:56,671
Do it now!

138
00:14:01,588 --> 00:14:03,215
Call 91 1 !

139
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:14,197
Stop! Hold it right there!

140
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:17,164
Hold it!

141
00:14:17,871 --> 00:14:20,931
-Hold it!
-Heading south, University Field!

142
00:14:25,912 --> 00:14:26,901
Get down!

143
00:14:28,414 --> 00:14:29,881
Wait, damn it!

144
00:14:30,316 --> 00:14:31,305
Get up here!

145
00:14:35,221 --> 00:14:36,279
Drop the gun!

146
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:38,480
Drop the gun!

147
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,600
Pogo, what's your 20?

148
00:14:49,168 --> 00:14:50,328
Damn it!

149
00:15:32,645 --> 00:15:35,045
This one's for my brother, bitch!

150
00:15:40,219 --> 00:15:43,382
Drop the fucking gun!
Drop the fucking gun!

151
00:15:44,324 --> 00:15:48,818
l said drop it! Get up!
Put your hands on top of your head.

152
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:51,519
Pogue, are you all right?
You all right?

153
00:15:51,731 --> 00:15:53,528
Don't you move! Get down!

154
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:56,661
Stay away from the gun!
Are you all right?

155
00:15:56,869 --> 00:15:59,633
Yeah! l'm good. l'm okay!

156
00:16:00,073 --> 00:16:02,598
Don't move!
Put your hands on your head!

157
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:05,642
-He's okay!
-l told you to wait!

158
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:26,524
l got you nectarines.
The peaches were as hard as rocks.

159
00:16:26,966 --> 00:16:29,059
Your coat's all dirty.

160
00:16:29,268 --> 00:16:30,496
l tackled a guy.

161
00:16:31,571 --> 00:16:33,402
Why did you tackle a guy?

162
00:16:33,606 --> 00:16:35,836
He was going for a touchdown.

163
00:16:36,376 --> 00:16:37,843
Can you be serious?

164
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:41,478
-What day is it today?
-Wednesday.

165
00:16:41,681 --> 00:16:42,739
No.

166
00:16:45,018 --> 00:16:47,111
-l met somebody today.
-Good.

167
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,086
Oh, you got the broccolini.
Thank you.

168
00:16:51,324 --> 00:16:52,518
lt was a woman.

169
00:16:53,793 --> 00:16:56,694
You didn't tackle her too, did you?

170
00:16:56,896 --> 00:17:00,627
-She's a police officer.
-Are you in trouble?

171
00:17:02,135 --> 00:17:06,367
-l don't think so.
-Well, that's a good thing.

172
00:17:10,877 --> 00:17:12,845
l better go now.

173
00:17:15,615 --> 00:17:18,311
-See you next week.
-Okay.

174
00:17:28,795 --> 00:17:31,923
Suddenly l see what's happening.

175
00:17:32,131 --> 00:17:34,531
Where are all the baby pigeons?

176
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:39,601
l see nests with tiny eggs,
but l don't see tiny pigeons. Why?

177
00:17:39,806 --> 00:17:42,366
You always ask the big questions.

178
00:17:42,575 --> 00:17:46,306
l got a big question for you.
l can only ask you....

179
00:17:46,512 --> 00:17:50,073
Here, use this. Call your wife.
Ask her instead.

180
00:17:50,283 --> 00:17:51,614
lt's the hospital.

181
00:17:53,186 --> 00:17:55,416
Yeah. Gonna be okay?

182
00:17:56,722 --> 00:17:57,711
Yeah.

183
00:17:58,858 --> 00:18:00,826
Brian's gonna be all right.

184
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:04,061
Didn't l tell you? He's tough.

185
00:18:04,263 --> 00:18:06,128
Tomorrow? We'll be there.

186
00:18:06,332 --> 00:18:08,994
-Where's your partner?
-He has a wife.

187
00:18:09,268 --> 00:18:12,829
-l got a wife.
-But his wife actually likes him.

188
00:18:13,306 --> 00:18:16,002
-Where you going?
-The head. All right?

189
00:18:16,209 --> 00:18:18,769
-To fix her makeup.
-Pogue wears makeup?

190
00:18:18,978 --> 00:18:22,470
Right, l need that
lipstick you borrowed back.

191
00:19:03,856 --> 00:19:08,088
l didn't think you'd show.
Why are you sitting here?

192
00:19:09,562 --> 00:19:12,053
l don't talk to a lot of people.

193
00:19:12,598 --> 00:19:15,226
Would you like to sit down?

194
00:19:16,135 --> 00:19:17,693
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

195
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:25,967
-l didn't thank you. l'm Sharon Pogue.
-l'm Catch.

196
00:19:26,145 --> 00:19:28,079
-Just Catch?
-Just Catch.

197
00:19:33,953 --> 00:19:36,183
Why would you do that, Catch?

198
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:39,916
-Jump somebody with a gun?
-He was gonna kill you.

199
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,196
He could have killed you.
You got a death wish?

200
00:19:44,397 --> 00:19:47,889
l guess l didn't have time
to think about it.

201
00:19:50,803 --> 00:19:52,998
-Hey!
-Hey, Pogo!

202
00:19:56,475 --> 00:20:00,707
-What do you think about it now?
-lt was worth the risk.

203
00:20:02,148 --> 00:20:04,912
-For somebody you don't even know?
-Yeah.

204
00:20:05,818 --> 00:20:09,117
And for what you do.
l think cops are great.

205
00:20:09,322 --> 00:20:13,816
Trying to keep it safe for everybody.
Tough job. Firemen...

206
00:20:14,026 --> 00:20:18,963
...they're heros. lKids wave at them.
People should wave at cops.

207
00:20:22,702 --> 00:20:25,000
-What are you laughing at?
-Nothing.

208
00:20:25,438 --> 00:20:29,670
Ever think of how many people
are here because you saved them?

209
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:34,710
Or helped them, or arrested
somebody who would've hurt them?

210
00:20:36,382 --> 00:20:41,115
-Never thought about it.
-Or just because you did your job.

211
00:20:42,989 --> 00:20:45,981
Now l'm walking around
because of you.

212
00:20:46,192 --> 00:20:48,057
Maybe you should be the cop.

213
00:20:50,463 --> 00:20:54,991
Wow, l don't know.
l don't look really good in hats.

214
00:21:04,577 --> 00:21:08,741
What do you do? Where do you live?
Where do you work?

215
00:21:12,652 --> 00:21:13,641
Okay.

216
00:21:15,588 --> 00:21:16,612
l'm sorry.

217
00:21:17,223 --> 00:21:22,160
Every time l talk to people, it comes
out like an interrogation.

218
00:21:25,498 --> 00:21:27,363
You have a nice smile.

219
00:21:29,535 --> 00:21:30,524
Thank you.

220
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:39,335
-You gonna let us meet your hero?
-Catch, this is Ray.

221
00:21:40,012 --> 00:21:41,946
-Hi, Ray.
-Catch.

222
00:21:42,948 --> 00:21:46,475
Why don't you join us?
We want to buy you dinner...

223
00:21:46,686 --> 00:21:49,018
...for saving Pogo's ass.

224
00:21:52,425 --> 00:21:56,384
You know, l'm kind of tired.
l'm gonna head home.

225
00:21:58,898 --> 00:22:01,765
-Did l interrupt something?
-All right.

226
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:05,198
l'll walk you to your car
if you'd like.

227
00:22:05,905 --> 00:22:07,167
Yeah. Sure.

228
00:22:12,044 --> 00:22:16,208
lt's a bad neighborhood.
Maybe l should walk you to your car.

229
00:22:16,415 --> 00:22:18,042
l don't have a car.

230
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,945
You want a ride home?

231
00:22:21,187 --> 00:22:23,883
No, thank you. l'd like to walk.

232
00:22:26,092 --> 00:22:28,060
Are you okay to drive?

233
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:29,828
l'm not drunk.

234
00:22:30,629 --> 00:22:34,429
You think l am? You'll know when
l'm drunk. l'll be throwing up.

235
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:36,726
And l never throw up, so....

236
00:22:38,704 --> 00:22:40,638
Don't worry about it, okay?

237
00:22:42,942 --> 00:22:44,967
Get in the car, will you?

238
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:02,223
l'm on Ashland, off 18th street.

239
00:23:16,575 --> 00:23:19,305
-l never drive.
-Why not?

240
00:23:28,721 --> 00:23:29,710
What?

241
00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:33,614
l was trying to picture you
without your clothes.

242
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:37,056
-Excuse me?
-l didn't mean it like that.

243
00:23:37,263 --> 00:23:40,824
l mean, l'm trying to picture
you out of uniform.

244
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,865
On your day off,
in regular clothes.

245
00:23:55,614 --> 00:23:57,377
l don't live here.

246
00:23:58,384 --> 00:24:00,614
l know. This is where l live.

247
00:24:03,589 --> 00:24:08,390
You know those guys at the bar?
They're my friends.

248
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:14,966
Sort of. We work together,
we tell jokes, we bullshit.

249
00:24:17,336 --> 00:24:18,963
l can't say to them....

250
00:24:20,105 --> 00:24:21,072
What?

251
00:24:26,178 --> 00:24:29,875
Every time l shut my eyes,
l see that damn gun.

252
00:24:30,816 --> 00:24:32,374
l hear that pop.

253
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:37,452
l feel a bullet slamming
into my chest and....

254
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,954
l don't know why l'm telling you,
except you were there....

255
00:24:51,303 --> 00:24:52,634
l must be drunk.

256
00:24:58,744 --> 00:25:03,807
l want to know why you were walking
by the stadium at that minute.

257
00:25:07,686 --> 00:25:10,154
What if you hadn't been there?

258
00:25:12,424 --> 00:25:14,915
l guess we were supposed to meet.

259
00:25:19,532 --> 00:25:22,399
lf you want, you can come in
for a bit.

260
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:24,536
Okay.

261
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,810
-You want a drink?
-No, thanks.

262
00:25:35,714 --> 00:25:37,682
Mind getting the door?

263
00:25:43,622 --> 00:25:45,453
Sit down or something.

264
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,424
l'm circling a while.

265
00:25:55,768 --> 00:25:58,601
Don't look.
l didn't straighten up.

266
00:25:58,804 --> 00:26:01,705
So? lt's more real this way.

267
00:26:02,841 --> 00:26:03,967
lt's rude.

268
00:26:05,277 --> 00:26:07,973
Now l'm here, you seem mad about it.

269
00:26:09,014 --> 00:26:11,778
Trust me, when l'm mad,
you'll know it.

270
00:26:13,786 --> 00:26:15,276
lt's just l'm not...

271
00:26:16,121 --> 00:26:18,521
...used to letting anybody up here.

272
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:22,253
But you're here, so....
Anyway....

273
00:26:22,661 --> 00:26:26,097
-Let's talk about something stupid.
-You first.

274
00:26:31,003 --> 00:26:35,804
What's that ''supposed to'' business?
That we were supposed to meet?

275
00:26:36,108 --> 00:26:40,807
lt sounds a little too
Psychic Friends Network to me.

276
00:26:43,282 --> 00:26:47,218
Some people say we each give off
a particular odor...

277
00:26:47,453 --> 00:26:51,549
...that can only be detected
by one other person's brain.

278
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,992
So we smell each other.

279
00:26:58,664 --> 00:27:01,132
-Who says that?
-l have no idea.

280
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:11,232
You're crazy.

281
00:27:22,621 --> 00:27:25,556
Thanks for coming up here.

282
00:27:27,526 --> 00:27:29,551
Does that mean l'm going?

283
00:27:30,295 --> 00:27:33,230
No! l mean, you don't have to.

284
00:27:33,432 --> 00:27:37,698
-So you're okay now.
-What, are you here as a medic?

285
00:27:39,138 --> 00:27:41,231
ls this the ''mad'' part?

286
00:27:45,377 --> 00:27:47,402
Maybe going is a good idea.

287
00:27:55,854 --> 00:27:57,845
Can l come back sometime?

288
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,057
Why?

289
00:28:02,194 --> 00:28:03,923
Must be the smell.

290
00:28:44,336 --> 00:28:45,530
l gotta go.

291
00:28:52,644 --> 00:28:54,134
Oh, God....

292
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:17,127
What's the matter, you blind?

293
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:18,968
Fucking idiot.

294
00:30:14,126 --> 00:30:16,185
What are you guys doing here?

295
00:30:16,428 --> 00:30:17,395
Hey, you!

296
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:21,627
Your mom's been bugging us
to come for lunch.

297
00:30:21,834 --> 00:30:25,235
-Mom, can we go now?
-ln a minute.

298
00:30:27,706 --> 00:30:29,139
So how is she?

299
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:33,639
She's really good.
She'll be happy to see you.

300
00:30:35,247 --> 00:30:36,680
My dad's not here?

301
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:41,879
So you talked to Larry? He told me.

302
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,648
Yeah. He told me about this
renewing-the-vows thing.

303
00:30:47,459 --> 00:30:49,427
You're gonna come, l hope?

304
00:30:50,863 --> 00:30:53,423
Come, Shar.
l think you should.

305
00:31:00,138 --> 00:31:02,902
Aunt Sharon, can l see
your police car?

306
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:10,071
-Come on, Mom!
-Hold on. l gotta go.

307
00:31:10,282 --> 00:31:11,112
Bye.

308
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:37,470
Looks the same.

309
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,842
Still smells like cigarettes.

310
00:31:41,413 --> 00:31:44,041
-Thought he quit.
-Only six a day.

311
00:31:50,622 --> 00:31:54,524
Larry told you l stopped by?
ls that why you called?

312
00:31:54,927 --> 00:31:59,330
l called you because we want you
to come when we renew our vows.

313
00:32:00,933 --> 00:32:03,458
How come you're renewing your vows?

314
00:32:06,238 --> 00:32:09,139
lt's a sort of a fresh start.

315
00:32:09,741 --> 00:32:10,765
Your idea?

316
00:32:12,344 --> 00:32:13,333
Both of us.

317
00:32:14,346 --> 00:32:17,338
lt's a way of having
the marriage blessed.

318
00:32:17,716 --> 00:32:19,650
Wasn't it blessed before?

319
00:32:23,221 --> 00:32:26,156
Of course it was blessed before.

320
00:32:29,461 --> 00:32:30,985
You just....

321
00:32:31,997 --> 00:32:35,558
-l just what, Ma?
-You just think of the bad.

322
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:39,931
You never remember the good.
l wish you remembered that.

323
00:32:40,172 --> 00:32:42,606
l wish l remembered it too.

324
00:32:43,775 --> 00:32:47,734
Does Dad? Does he remember
anything good about me?

325
00:32:50,649 --> 00:32:52,640
He doesn't hate you.

326
00:32:53,719 --> 00:32:57,519
-He just still feels hurt.
-Hurt?

327
00:32:57,923 --> 00:32:59,015
l hurt him?

328
00:33:00,192 --> 00:33:04,356
Being arrested like that?
Nobody forgets that.

329
00:33:04,596 --> 00:33:07,087
How did you forget what he did to you?

330
00:33:07,632 --> 00:33:09,623
lt wasn't as bad--

331
00:33:10,402 --> 00:33:15,738
You make it sound worse.
lt hadn't been like this for years.

332
00:33:15,941 --> 00:33:19,638
l'm glad it hasn't been that way.
That means it worked!

333
00:33:19,845 --> 00:33:21,369
That's why l did it!

334
00:33:22,614 --> 00:33:25,344
Why do l get punished for this?

335
00:33:28,053 --> 00:33:30,021
Nobody's punishing you.

336
00:33:32,024 --> 00:33:33,719
We're inviting you.

337
00:33:35,961 --> 00:33:37,087
Will you come?

338
00:34:52,471 --> 00:34:54,735
-Do you have a machine?
-What?

339
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,568
-Do you have an answering machine?
-Yes.

340
00:34:57,809 --> 00:35:00,972
Hang up, and l'll call your machine.

341
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:02,168
Why?

342
00:35:14,259 --> 00:35:17,786
Please leave a message after the tone.

343
00:35:19,097 --> 00:35:20,689
lt's Sharon.

344
00:35:21,733 --> 00:35:23,667
Maybe we can...

345
00:35:24,202 --> 00:35:27,103
...have breakfast or something.

346
00:35:27,305 --> 00:35:31,002
I usually get up early
to run in Lincoln Park.

347
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:34,042
There's a coffee shop
across the street.

348
00:35:35,247 --> 00:35:39,206
Like 8 or so?
If you're there, you're there.

349
00:35:59,504 --> 00:36:02,473
Please leave a message
after the tone.

350
00:36:02,674 --> 00:36:05,541
Hi. Don'tpick up. Look...

351
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:09,006
...I didn't get much sleep...

352
00:36:09,214 --> 00:36:12,274
...and maybe this was
a bad idea anyway.

353
00:36:12,551 --> 00:36:15,748
I was feeling kind of weird
last night.

354
00:36:15,954 --> 00:36:17,945
Anyway, I'm fiine now.

355
00:36:18,156 --> 00:36:21,523
So let's just leave it where it's at.

356
00:36:33,505 --> 00:36:34,494
Fuck!

357
00:36:36,508 --> 00:36:37,497
What?

358
00:36:40,011 --> 00:36:41,774
Who is it? What?

359
00:36:49,421 --> 00:36:52,481
l was just getting to sleep, finally.

360
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:54,552
We made a date.

361
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,625
lt wasn't a date.

362
00:36:56,828 --> 00:36:59,558
An appointment.
l keep my appointments.

363
00:36:59,764 --> 00:37:03,894
Do you have door issues?
l called you at 7:00.

364
00:37:04,102 --> 00:37:08,004
l get up early. l walked there.
l waited for you.

365
00:37:08,206 --> 00:37:10,037
Check your messages.

366
00:37:11,309 --> 00:37:13,937
l need sleep. Come back in a month.

367
00:37:14,145 --> 00:37:18,411
-Why do you think l'd come back?
-Why are you here?

368
00:37:19,217 --> 00:37:22,448
When you tell somebody
you'll be somewhere...

369
00:37:22,654 --> 00:37:25,885
...that person rearranges his life.
Be aware of that.

370
00:37:26,091 --> 00:37:28,685
-And more considerate--
-What's in the bag?

371
00:37:28,893 --> 00:37:29,985
What?

372
00:37:30,295 --> 00:37:33,594
-What's in the bag?
-None of your business.

373
00:37:34,232 --> 00:37:35,221
Got coffee?

374
00:37:36,401 --> 00:37:38,562
You think you deserve coffee?

375
00:37:40,772 --> 00:37:42,137
What about food?

376
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:46,336
You definitely don't deserve food.

377
00:37:47,812 --> 00:37:51,680
-l got coffee, sugar, sweetener--
-Black.

378
00:37:52,817 --> 00:37:55,251
-Whatever.
-Just black.

379
00:37:57,255 --> 00:38:01,453
So what kind of life
did you rearrange to get coffee?

380
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:05,291
You never talk about yourself.
What do you do?

381
00:38:05,497 --> 00:38:09,627
-What's the difference?
-What's the difference?

382
00:38:10,435 --> 00:38:14,769
You're standing in my bedroom,
looking through my panty drawer.

383
00:38:14,973 --> 00:38:16,668
That's the difference.

384
00:38:17,442 --> 00:38:18,431
Who are you?

385
00:38:20,111 --> 00:38:22,579
Somebody who keeps his appointments.

386
00:38:24,316 --> 00:38:26,284
Shit, you're married!

387
00:38:28,486 --> 00:38:31,250
Give me my coffee.
Give it here.

388
00:38:32,524 --> 00:38:33,513
What--!

389
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,736
l know, you're a criminal.
Probably a felon.

390
00:38:45,937 --> 00:38:48,770
That's great.
That's all l need.

391
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:53,306
My name is Catch.
l don't commit crimes.

392
00:38:53,645 --> 00:38:55,613
l like being with you.

393
00:38:55,914 --> 00:38:57,040
That's bullshit.

394
00:38:58,717 --> 00:39:00,241
l let you in here.

395
00:39:00,452 --> 00:39:04,684
l'm not gonna know anything
about you? l need details.

396
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:08,552
-l need to start from here.
-That's ridiculous! Why?

397
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,760
Because that's the way it is.

398
00:39:13,331 --> 00:39:14,525
Oh, your rules.

399
00:39:17,702 --> 00:39:18,828
My rules.

400
00:39:20,805 --> 00:39:24,832
Fine, l didn't want to know you
that much anyway.

401
00:39:27,078 --> 00:39:29,672
l don't need this shit. l'm tired.

402
00:39:30,482 --> 00:39:32,643
Haven't slept all night.

403
00:39:42,394 --> 00:39:43,224
Bye.

404
00:40:29,441 --> 00:40:30,806
Can l come in?

405
00:40:31,676 --> 00:40:33,166
Yeah. Come in.

406
00:40:34,879 --> 00:40:35,868
Thanks.

407
00:40:36,648 --> 00:40:39,173
Get that door thing under control.

408
00:40:43,154 --> 00:40:44,280
You live here?

409
00:40:47,392 --> 00:40:51,453
Nobody lives here. What is this,
some kind of front?

410
00:40:51,663 --> 00:40:54,962
-ls this what you told me about?
-What?

411
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,965
Your interrogation.
So do l need a lawyer?

412
00:41:00,438 --> 00:41:02,872
l don't like being jerked around.

413
00:41:03,308 --> 00:41:04,297
l'm not.

414
00:41:05,844 --> 00:41:08,574
Then tell me straight.
Who are you?

415
00:41:09,247 --> 00:41:10,976
What are you looking for?

416
00:41:12,116 --> 00:41:14,949
Your life.
l don't want any surprises.

417
00:41:15,753 --> 00:41:20,315
This is it. l sleep here. l walk
around town. That's all.

418
00:41:23,928 --> 00:41:25,691
That's all of it?

419
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:29,633
Except for you.

420
00:41:30,969 --> 00:41:32,630
The way l feel about you.

421
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,329
Which is...?

422
00:41:39,711 --> 00:41:44,045
Surprising.
l thought it was impossible.

423
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:48,109
l thought l was....

424
00:41:50,221 --> 00:41:52,746
You thought you were what? Gay?

425
00:41:56,127 --> 00:41:57,253
Dead.

426
00:41:58,863 --> 00:42:01,263
Am l supposed to understand that?

427
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,365
No, you're not.

428
00:42:04,569 --> 00:42:07,663
Do you ever wonder
what ''scratch'' means?

429
00:42:07,872 --> 00:42:12,866
What people mean when they say,
''Let's start from scratch''?

430
00:42:13,077 --> 00:42:14,772
This is scratch.

431
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:20,948
This is scratch, all right.

432
00:42:28,426 --> 00:42:33,056
-So this cat knows where you live?
-He's not dangerous.

433
00:42:33,264 --> 00:42:37,360
He's in no databases.
There's no Catch anywhere--

434
00:42:37,569 --> 00:42:39,901
You ran his name through?

435
00:42:40,104 --> 00:42:43,471
-He's a ghost.
-l can't believe you did that!

436
00:42:43,675 --> 00:42:48,612
-l'm just looking out for you.
-l don't need you to look out for me.

437
00:42:51,082 --> 00:42:53,778
No last name. That shit's weird.

438
00:43:03,061 --> 00:43:04,892
Oh, l remember that.

439
00:43:05,096 --> 00:43:07,257
That was a smile.

440
00:43:07,465 --> 00:43:11,162
You know the cop? The woman cop?
She visited me.

441
00:43:12,704 --> 00:43:14,262
You're seeing her?

442
00:43:14,806 --> 00:43:18,742
She asks lots of questions.
She wants to know everything.

443
00:43:18,943 --> 00:43:21,434
Of course she does. Everybody does.

444
00:43:22,413 --> 00:43:23,846
Talk to her.

445
00:43:24,649 --> 00:43:28,847
-Talk to her about what?
-Talk to her, Catch.

446
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:32,656
Talk to somebody.
lt's been almost a year.

447
00:43:33,391 --> 00:43:36,827
Every time l talk to somebody,
it gets a little easier.

448
00:43:37,028 --> 00:43:39,519
l'm not saying it goes away--

449
00:43:43,701 --> 00:43:44,759
She nice?

450
00:43:47,705 --> 00:43:48,694
She's...

451
00:43:49,107 --> 00:43:50,438
...tough.

452
00:43:51,275 --> 00:43:52,537
She pretty?

453
00:43:54,612 --> 00:43:56,341
That doesn't matter.

454
00:43:57,882 --> 00:43:59,440
She's pretty.

455
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:03,851
She's sort of pissed off at me.

456
00:44:04,055 --> 00:44:05,420
Apologize.

457
00:44:06,257 --> 00:44:08,350
-For what?
-lt doesn't matter.

458
00:44:09,527 --> 00:44:12,291
We like it when men apologize.

459
00:44:47,031 --> 00:44:49,192
l thought l'd get your machine.

460
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,426
Want to call back?
I won't answer.

461
00:44:54,372 --> 00:44:56,237
l thought you'd be working.

462
00:44:56,941 --> 00:44:58,966
l wish l was.

463
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:00,541
Can't sleep?

464
00:45:02,747 --> 00:45:03,805
Me neither.

465
00:45:05,149 --> 00:45:06,980
Want to go somewhere?

466
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,783
Now? lt's 3 a.m.
The whole world is sleeping.

467
00:45:14,092 --> 00:45:15,650
Not the whole world.

468
00:45:17,528 --> 00:45:18,859
ls this a date?

469
00:45:20,198 --> 00:45:22,029
Just an appointment.

470
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:48,884
We can rest, if you want.

471
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,321
Well, then rest.

472
00:45:51,662 --> 00:45:52,959
See you later.

473
00:45:57,135 --> 00:45:59,194
l wish we could go swimming.

474
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:00,937
Why can't we?

475
00:46:01,539 --> 00:46:03,166
ln our clothes?

476
00:46:04,242 --> 00:46:08,736
Oh, my God! You can't take off
your clothes in a state park!

477
00:46:10,448 --> 00:46:12,848
You need to learn to take a day off.

478
00:46:14,152 --> 00:46:14,982
Come on!

479
00:46:16,654 --> 00:46:18,485
Where are you going?

480
00:46:21,459 --> 00:46:22,619
l'm gonna tell!

481
00:47:04,735 --> 00:47:05,724
Oh, my God.

482
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:13,699
Oh, God!

483
00:47:20,852 --> 00:47:22,080
Freezing!

484
00:47:31,295 --> 00:47:34,196
lKiss me someplace
l've never been kissed.

485
00:48:09,267 --> 00:48:12,100
lKiss me someplace
l've never been kissed.

486
00:49:31,549 --> 00:49:32,516
Thank you.

487
00:49:34,885 --> 00:49:39,185
What did l tell you about leaving
the apartment without me?

488
00:49:40,091 --> 00:49:41,058
Gotta go.

489
00:49:51,869 --> 00:49:55,896
1034 to Rob-67, location confiirmed
as Pogue residence...

490
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:59,598
...possible 415.
Neighbor is standing outside.

491
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,485
-Where's Larry?
-Calm down.

492
00:50:11,689 --> 00:50:14,658
-Where is he?
-We waited to book him.

493
00:50:14,892 --> 00:50:17,087
-Where is he?
-You gonna calm down?

494
00:50:17,294 --> 00:50:20,024
Don't talk to me like l'm a child!

495
00:50:20,264 --> 00:50:22,255
He's out back with Denny.

496
00:50:23,934 --> 00:50:27,199
lKathy's inside with the kid.
Vanessa's with him.

497
00:50:30,408 --> 00:50:32,308
l'm gonna kill you!

498
00:50:40,684 --> 00:50:42,914
l'm getting nowhere with her.

499
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,849
-Maybe you can try.
-Got it.

500
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:47,348
Are you okay?

501
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:52,557
Neighbors moved in two weeks ago,
and they're calling the police.

502
00:50:52,763 --> 00:50:54,526
Welcome to the neighborhood.

503
00:50:54,732 --> 00:50:58,862
-Must've gotten pretty loud.
-We had a fight. People fight.

504
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:02,465
Why don't you tell me--

505
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,264
Oh, my--

506
00:51:06,043 --> 00:51:07,010
Shit!

507
00:51:07,344 --> 00:51:10,609
-Don't make it worse.
-lt gets worse?

508
00:51:11,315 --> 00:51:15,376
-lt's never happened before.
-Oh, first time for everything.

509
00:51:15,619 --> 00:51:19,680
Don't fucking patronize me.
l don't need this shit.

510
00:51:24,762 --> 00:51:27,697
-Look at you.
- Look at you, in my house!

511
00:51:27,898 --> 00:51:31,334
Policing my family!
Where do you get off?

512
00:51:31,735 --> 00:51:34,169
lt's me. l didn't hit you.

513
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:39,776
l don't want your fucking pity, okay?

514
00:51:40,144 --> 00:51:43,944
lt happened, all right?
He's torn up about it.

515
00:51:44,582 --> 00:51:48,541
He's torn up about it? Fuck him!
He's torn up?

516
00:51:50,354 --> 00:51:52,413
Has he hit Larry, Jr. yet?

517
00:51:54,391 --> 00:51:58,259
He'd never do that.
He's a good man, Sharon.

518
00:51:58,529 --> 00:52:00,997
That's what my mother said to us.

519
00:52:01,198 --> 00:52:04,599
''Your father's a good man.
He's torn up about it.''

520
00:52:06,871 --> 00:52:11,103
Get out of my house.
Get the fuck out of my house!

521
00:52:19,917 --> 00:52:22,249
Have you looked into counseling?

522
00:52:22,453 --> 00:52:25,911
-Want to hit a woman? Hit me!
-Fuck! Here we go.

523
00:52:26,157 --> 00:52:27,283
-Calm--
-Back off.

524
00:52:27,525 --> 00:52:31,359
-lt was an accident.
-lt looks more like a car accident.

525
00:52:31,562 --> 00:52:33,530
-Very funny. Look--
-Shut up!

526
00:52:34,265 --> 00:52:36,893
You disgust me, you fucking coward!

527
00:52:37,401 --> 00:52:38,868
You're a fucking cunt!

528
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:42,264
-What are you doing?
-Let go! Get off!

529
00:52:42,506 --> 00:52:43,973
You guys saw that.

530
00:52:44,175 --> 00:52:47,576
You saw that.
You're witnesses. That's assault!

531
00:52:48,546 --> 00:52:50,377
l'll press charges.

532
00:52:50,581 --> 00:52:52,549
Let him press charges!

533
00:52:52,783 --> 00:52:55,752
What are you talking about?
l'm bleeding!

534
00:52:55,953 --> 00:52:59,013
l saw nothing.
l saw you trip and fall.

535
00:53:00,925 --> 00:53:02,893
Look at her! She's crazy!

536
00:53:03,127 --> 00:53:07,723
You lay a hand on her again
and l'll arrest you myself!

537
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,197
You're just like him!

538
00:53:12,102 --> 00:53:14,400
Yeah, and what about you?

539
00:53:22,846 --> 00:53:23,870
Get some help.

540
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:29,513
Okay. All right.
Thanks for coming down.

541
00:54:43,994 --> 00:54:47,896
My mother always said
it was a family thing.

542
00:54:48,899 --> 00:54:53,700
That l'd broken some kind of
sacred oath. l don't know.

543
00:54:56,073 --> 00:55:00,567
When we walked in that day
and saw him beating her....

544
00:55:06,617 --> 00:55:08,915
What was l supposed to do?

545
00:55:12,723 --> 00:55:17,319
Larry was the one who'd always
jump in and protect her.

546
00:55:18,128 --> 00:55:20,289
And he always paid for it.

547
00:55:24,134 --> 00:55:26,227
l never did anything.

548
00:55:28,405 --> 00:55:31,340
l just ran and hide.

549
00:55:31,542 --> 00:55:35,876
You did the right thing.
You called for help.

550
00:55:36,113 --> 00:55:38,343
A lot of good it did me.

551
00:55:39,249 --> 00:55:41,513
But you didn't do it for you.

552
00:55:51,662 --> 00:55:53,789
All those years...

553
00:55:58,902 --> 00:56:00,927
...my dad never hurt me.

554
00:56:02,172 --> 00:56:03,161
Not once.

555
00:56:06,844 --> 00:56:08,311
Yes, he did.

556
00:56:29,266 --> 00:56:31,234
Stop right there! Stop!

557
00:56:32,569 --> 00:56:33,536
Freeze!

558
00:56:36,106 --> 00:56:37,073
Shit!

559
00:56:37,307 --> 00:56:40,970
l got constitutionality issues
for my attorney!

560
00:56:41,211 --> 00:56:44,009
Mr. Steak lKnife
has ''constitutionality issues.''

561
00:56:44,214 --> 00:56:45,841
Bitch, that ain't mine.

562
00:56:46,083 --> 00:56:47,414
Watch your mouth.

563
00:56:48,919 --> 00:56:52,047
He's trying to stick up for his lady.

564
00:56:52,289 --> 00:56:56,248
You want to share love with your
partner, right, Officer Ho?

565
00:56:56,493 --> 00:57:01,021
-Ho! Officer Ho!
-Or Officer Bitch? Which one is it?

566
00:57:01,231 --> 00:57:02,630
You ain't seen nothing.

567
00:57:03,233 --> 00:57:05,997
Fuck up your life, l don't care.

568
00:57:06,236 --> 00:57:09,262
You want this life
for your little brother?

569
00:57:09,473 --> 00:57:13,739
Banging until he's shot in the head
like your older brother?

570
00:57:14,711 --> 00:57:16,872
He's a kid. He's got a chance.

571
00:57:17,347 --> 00:57:22,148
-l ain't got a chance?
-No, l'm saying this is your chance.

572
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,889
Are you smart enough to recognize it?

573
00:57:35,532 --> 00:57:37,466
Come on, get in back.

574
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:42,504
What, you found God or something?

575
00:57:42,739 --> 00:57:45,173
Don't bust my balls, all right?

576
00:58:05,329 --> 00:58:06,318
Come in!

577
00:58:14,705 --> 00:58:17,265
Hey, you got some new furniture.

578
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:23,370
-And a new friend. Who's this?
-Bob.

579
00:58:24,748 --> 00:58:28,115
-You named your dog Bob.
-No, that was his name.

580
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:30,812
-He told you that?
-Yeah.

581
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:42,130
l got something too. An invitation
to my parents' renewal of vows.

582
00:58:42,366 --> 00:58:46,268
lt came today.
Found it the mailbox this morning.

583
00:58:47,371 --> 00:58:48,633
Are you gonna go?

584
00:58:50,741 --> 00:58:51,935
l don't know.

585
00:58:53,377 --> 00:58:54,571
Would you?

586
00:58:55,812 --> 00:58:58,337
Are you asking me to go with you?

587
00:59:00,183 --> 00:59:01,741
Why, would you do that?

588
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:04,912
Can Bob come?

589
00:59:08,725 --> 00:59:09,714
Sure.

590
00:59:12,996 --> 00:59:15,089
Now that we got that settled....

591
00:59:15,465 --> 00:59:17,126
Feed me. l'm hungry.

592
00:59:17,801 --> 00:59:19,564
l'll get my jacket.

593
00:59:24,775 --> 00:59:28,040
And change your T-shirt.
You smell like dog.

594
01:00:12,089 --> 01:00:13,613
What are you doing?

595
01:00:14,858 --> 01:00:18,316
-What's with the toys?
-Don't go through my things.

596
01:00:18,528 --> 01:00:20,496
l wasn't. lt was open.

597
01:00:22,332 --> 01:00:24,527
Why do you have all these toys?

598
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:33,008
l didn't mean to upset you.

599
01:00:36,046 --> 01:00:37,172
Come on.

600
01:00:37,948 --> 01:00:39,245
Let's just go.

601
01:00:46,223 --> 01:00:47,212
What?

602
01:00:48,358 --> 01:00:49,347
Nothing.

603
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:50,949
Let's go.

604
01:00:51,762 --> 01:00:52,922
Be good, Bob.

605
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:02,404
-You know everybody?
-How you doing?

606
01:01:02,606 --> 01:01:04,233
Going uphill, man.

607
01:01:04,574 --> 01:01:06,041
-You try it.
-No....

608
01:01:06,243 --> 01:01:07,232
Go ahead.

609
01:01:10,147 --> 01:01:11,944
l feel like a jerk.

610
01:01:12,883 --> 01:01:14,077
Try again.

611
01:01:24,461 --> 01:01:25,450
What?

612
01:01:26,563 --> 01:01:28,360
You like blues?

613
01:01:29,399 --> 01:01:31,299
Come on, let's go in.

614
01:01:32,903 --> 01:01:33,892
Come on.

615
01:01:46,717 --> 01:01:49,413
Take off your coat.
Let's stay a while.

616
01:01:55,258 --> 01:01:56,247
Come on.

617
01:06:09,713 --> 01:06:12,978
That was incredible!
l didn't know you played.

618
01:06:13,183 --> 01:06:15,708
-Why didn't you tell me?
-l don't know.

619
01:06:15,919 --> 01:06:19,355
-Why'd you leave? lt was great!
-Steve!

620
01:06:19,556 --> 01:06:23,151
Oh, man, l don't believe this!
Steve Lambert!

621
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:25,988
How you doing? You okay?
lt's been--

622
01:06:26,196 --> 01:06:29,165
You have me confused with
somebody else.

623
01:06:29,366 --> 01:06:31,891
You kidding me? Stevie, it's me.

624
01:06:32,102 --> 01:06:34,536
-Tony!
-l don't know a Steve.

625
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:37,331
ls it a joke?

626
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:42,068
l was up in my office and
l heard that sound, your sound.

627
01:06:42,612 --> 01:06:44,580
l don't know who you are.

628
01:06:44,781 --> 01:06:46,339
Get away from me!

629
01:06:48,885 --> 01:06:51,251
You mind explaining this to me?

630
01:06:51,454 --> 01:06:54,821
Who is that?
You owe him money or something?

631
01:06:56,059 --> 01:06:57,822
l don't know who he is.

632
01:06:58,762 --> 01:07:00,229
ls your name Steve?

633
01:07:01,798 --> 01:07:03,527
My name's Catch.

634
01:07:04,401 --> 01:07:06,392
-What do you want?
-The truth!

635
01:07:06,836 --> 01:07:09,304
-Who's Steve Lambert?
-l don't know.

636
01:07:10,173 --> 01:07:12,232
Are we living some kind of lie?

637
01:07:12,442 --> 01:07:15,536
What'll l find out next?
That you are married?

638
01:07:19,916 --> 01:07:23,352
-Where are you going?
-What do you want me to say?

639
01:07:23,553 --> 01:07:27,284
l don't want you to say anything!
Don't say anything.

640
01:07:29,325 --> 01:07:31,793
You want to go? Go.

641
01:10:41,718 --> 01:10:44,812
Please leave a message after the tone.

642
01:10:45,021 --> 01:10:47,683
Catch, it's me. Can you pick up?

643
01:10:51,628 --> 01:10:55,325
Listen, I was wondering if
we could meet tomorrow.

644
01:10:55,531 --> 01:10:59,763
At this place called Enrico's.
It's on Halsted and Marion.

645
01:11:00,903 --> 01:11:02,700
Around 2:00, okay?

646
01:11:05,341 --> 01:11:06,330
Okay.

647
01:11:07,644 --> 01:11:08,633
Bye.

648
01:11:46,516 --> 01:11:49,952
-About the other day--
-You don't have to explain.

649
01:11:50,153 --> 01:11:51,677
l probably do.

650
01:11:52,455 --> 01:11:54,787
But.... l'm fine.

651
01:12:00,096 --> 01:12:01,188
Come on.

652
01:12:04,901 --> 01:12:07,426
l thought we were having coffee.

653
01:12:07,637 --> 01:12:10,629
-You can trust me, you know.
-l know that.

654
01:12:11,941 --> 01:12:13,499
l'd never hurt you.

655
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:22,140
Remember when you said some people
were meant to meet each other?

656
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:27,956
Maybe we were meant to
meet that night.

657
01:12:28,991 --> 01:12:30,822
The night l held your hand.

658
01:12:32,128 --> 01:12:33,595
What do you mean?

659
01:12:35,898 --> 01:12:37,456
Maybe you don't remember.

660
01:12:37,667 --> 01:12:41,103
-You were unconscious--
-No, l don't.

661
01:12:42,138 --> 01:12:43,628
l was there.

662
01:12:45,108 --> 01:12:47,770
lt was me that was there that night.

663
01:12:48,277 --> 01:12:49,710
At the accident?

664
01:12:52,548 --> 01:12:54,539
What are you talking about?

665
01:12:55,184 --> 01:12:57,982
-Maybe it's why we met again.
-What are you doing?

666
01:12:58,187 --> 01:13:00,678
-Trying to help.
-With what? l'm fine.

667
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:04,656
-l don't think you are. You pretend--
-l'm not pretending!

668
01:13:04,861 --> 01:13:06,886
-You're lying.
-l'm not lying!

669
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:11,362
Then walk in there. And l'll
walk in there with you.

670
01:13:11,567 --> 01:13:14,934
-Why are you doing this?
-Because you had a family.

671
01:13:15,138 --> 01:13:17,902
-Shut up. Stop.
-You had a wife and a child.

672
01:13:18,107 --> 01:13:21,406
l'm so sorry it happened.
l want you to have a life.

673
01:13:21,611 --> 01:13:23,545
l have a life. We don't need--

674
01:13:23,746 --> 01:13:27,409
-Please! lt happened.
-We don't need to go into this.

675
01:13:27,617 --> 01:13:30,484
-Please--
-You like to push people, don't you?

676
01:13:30,686 --> 01:13:33,951
l just want to understand you,
to know who you are.

677
01:13:34,157 --> 01:13:39,220
l can't do that if you don't let me.
l know it's hard, l can imagine--

678
01:13:39,429 --> 01:13:41,192
You can't imagine anything!

679
01:13:41,397 --> 01:13:44,423
You have no idea how it feels
to do what l did--

680
01:13:46,936 --> 01:13:47,925
What?

681
01:13:52,542 --> 01:13:54,407
Stay with me, okay?

682
01:13:55,611 --> 01:14:00,310
lt's not your fault.
l was there, l saw the reports.

683
01:14:00,516 --> 01:14:03,610
That truck, it just-- Catch, please.

684
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:06,948
l'm trying to tell you
something, okay?

685
01:14:09,559 --> 01:14:11,993
l'm trying to tell you that....

686
01:14:12,395 --> 01:14:13,589
You're not alone.

687
01:14:15,398 --> 01:14:18,834
-l'm trying to tell you that l....
-Don't.

688
01:14:34,817 --> 01:14:39,049
-You're supposed to be his dad!
-Can't you take him?

689
01:14:39,255 --> 01:14:42,156
l'll be busy!
l won't have time today!

690
01:14:42,358 --> 01:14:43,882
And l have time?

691
01:15:28,137 --> 01:15:31,573
That's a hell of a greeting.
What's up with you?

692
01:15:32,341 --> 01:15:37,301
You don't return my calls. Haven't
shown up for work three, four days.

693
01:15:38,114 --> 01:15:40,582
You don't look like you got the flu.

694
01:15:43,052 --> 01:15:46,180
-l take it Freak Show dumped you?
-Fuck you.

695
01:15:48,591 --> 01:15:51,253
l wish l could say l'm sorry,
but l ain't.

696
01:15:51,494 --> 01:15:53,587
l think it's best for everybody.

697
01:15:53,829 --> 01:15:56,662
-Really? And who's ''everybody''?
-Me.

698
01:16:02,471 --> 01:16:05,872
Martha Stewart, you gonna pour
your partner a cup?

699
01:16:09,612 --> 01:16:10,738
He had you.

700
01:16:11,614 --> 01:16:13,047
He got you, didn't he?

701
01:16:15,418 --> 01:16:18,319
l'm gonna give you some
real strong advice.

702
01:16:20,990 --> 01:16:22,685
Change the subject.

703
01:16:27,330 --> 01:16:28,763
Charlene's pregnant.

704
01:16:33,235 --> 01:16:34,463
That's great.

705
01:16:36,439 --> 01:16:37,963
Congratulations.

706
01:16:40,209 --> 01:16:43,303
l'm not sure l'm ready to
be a daddy yet.

707
01:16:45,247 --> 01:16:47,715
l haven't gotten over Miss Stillwell.

708
01:16:50,386 --> 01:16:51,410
Who?

709
01:16:52,855 --> 01:16:54,948
Tenth-grade English teacher.

710
01:16:55,758 --> 01:16:58,022
Hot buttered Stillwell.

711
01:17:05,901 --> 01:17:08,802
l know you gotta go through this.

712
01:17:09,005 --> 01:17:12,168
l'll tell the boss
l stopped by to see you.

713
01:17:12,408 --> 01:17:15,809
You as sick as a dog,
coughing up organs and shit.

714
01:17:16,012 --> 01:17:18,742
But l can't let this
go on much longer.

715
01:17:19,682 --> 01:17:22,173
We got us a job to do out there.

716
01:17:22,518 --> 01:17:26,147
We gotta clean these streets
before my baby gets here.

717
01:17:26,622 --> 01:17:28,590
You know what l'm saying?

718
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:59,080
Has he been here?

719
01:17:59,655 --> 01:18:04,183
l was expecting him this
morning. He shops for me.

720
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:08,787
l give him money from the settlement
every week.

721
01:18:09,865 --> 01:18:12,095
Can't talk about that with him.

722
01:18:15,137 --> 01:18:19,733
When he comes here, do you ever
talk about the accident?

723
01:18:20,576 --> 01:18:23,704
-Does he ever mention the past?
-No.

724
01:18:23,913 --> 01:18:24,880
Why not?

725
01:18:25,414 --> 01:18:28,850
l try to let him
find his own way through.

726
01:18:30,219 --> 01:18:32,016
l feel he needs that.

727
01:18:36,025 --> 01:18:38,823
Why are you here, Sharon?

728
01:18:39,628 --> 01:18:41,926
l want to know how to help him.

729
01:18:42,164 --> 01:18:45,565
-You are helping him.
-l don't think so.

730
01:18:46,102 --> 01:18:48,070
What makes you think that?

731
01:18:49,872 --> 01:18:51,931
l took him to the cemetery--

732
01:18:52,174 --> 01:18:53,505
The cemetery?

733
01:18:54,577 --> 01:18:56,272
l thought it might help.

734
01:18:56,746 --> 01:18:58,407
He needs to face it.

735
01:19:00,649 --> 01:19:04,050
He will face it, in his time.

736
01:19:07,356 --> 01:19:11,793
He built a wall around that whole day
and that night.

737
01:19:12,027 --> 01:19:15,019
My daughter and my grandson.

738
01:19:15,264 --> 01:19:17,198
He can't help it.

739
01:19:19,668 --> 01:19:21,465
A cemetery....

740
01:19:23,038 --> 01:19:27,270
Do you know how hard it is for me
to go to the cemetery?

741
01:19:28,077 --> 01:19:32,070
l was just trying to help him
get back to some kind of life.

742
01:19:32,481 --> 01:19:33,948
He was coming back.

743
01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:37,745
Don't you realize how he's
changed these past weeks?

744
01:19:37,987 --> 01:19:41,718
His apartment, his life?
He fell in love.

745
01:19:41,957 --> 01:19:47,190
Why do you want to rush things? Why
does everybody rush things these days?

746
01:19:50,633 --> 01:19:51,895
l was scared.

747
01:19:53,102 --> 01:19:54,797
Scared of what?

748
01:19:57,106 --> 01:19:58,266
Of losing him.

749
01:19:59,775 --> 01:20:02,744
And l guess that's what l did.
l lost him.

750
01:20:03,746 --> 01:20:06,442
You were just trying to find your way.

751
01:20:07,082 --> 01:20:09,277
What else can we do?

752
01:20:09,885 --> 01:20:14,584
You think l'm always sure about what
l should or shouldn't say to him?

753
01:20:14,824 --> 01:20:17,657
l just try to do what's right...

754
01:20:17,893 --> 01:20:21,556
...and hope that he'll
find the love in it.

755
01:20:24,266 --> 01:20:25,824
Look at you...

756
01:20:26,535 --> 01:20:29,436
...so worried now, and miserable.

757
01:20:34,109 --> 01:20:36,100
There's love in that.

758
01:20:48,557 --> 01:20:49,387
''l just...

759
01:20:50,292 --> 01:20:52,954
...wanted to wish you both the best.''

760
01:20:53,762 --> 01:20:58,461
''l just want to wish you both well
and say congratulations.''

761
01:21:03,973 --> 01:21:06,464
''Hi, Mom, Dad.

762
01:21:06,976 --> 01:21:10,275
l just stopped by
to say congratulations...

763
01:21:10,479 --> 01:21:13,471
...and l think it's great.''

764
01:21:20,089 --> 01:21:21,317
These shoes, no.

765
01:21:29,632 --> 01:21:32,692
Please leave a message after the tone.

766
01:21:33,802 --> 01:21:34,791
Catch?

767
01:21:36,005 --> 01:21:37,472
Can you pick up?

768
01:21:44,246 --> 01:21:45,838
Will you call me?

769
01:21:57,626 --> 01:22:02,757
You declared your love for one
another in the presence of Christ.

770
01:22:02,965 --> 01:22:05,058
He consecrated you in baptism...

771
01:22:05,267 --> 01:22:09,670
...enriched and strengthened you
in the sacrament of matrimony...

772
01:22:09,905 --> 01:22:14,774
...so you can carry out the duties of
marriage in lasting fidelity.

773
01:22:32,761 --> 01:22:35,992
--congratulates you
and rejoices with you...

774
01:22:36,198 --> 01:22:39,258
...on reaching this milestone
in your journey.

775
01:22:40,069 --> 01:22:42,560
Are you prepared to
give yourselves again...

776
01:22:42,771 --> 01:22:45,262
...to that union larger
than yourselves...

777
01:22:45,474 --> 01:22:48,705
...that union already
blessed by God?

778
01:22:48,911 --> 01:22:50,469
-Yes.
-Yes, we are.

779
01:22:50,679 --> 01:22:54,638
Face each other and join hands
please, and say after me:

780
01:22:55,284 --> 01:22:57,275
-l, Carl...
-l, Carl...

781
01:22:57,486 --> 01:23:00,250
-...take thee, Josephine...
-...take thee, Josephine...

782
01:23:00,489 --> 01:23:03,322
-...to be my wife.
-...to be my wife.

783
01:23:04,226 --> 01:23:06,251
-l, Josephine...
-l, Josephine...

784
01:23:06,495 --> 01:23:08,429
-...take you, Carl...
-...take you, Carl...

785
01:23:08,630 --> 01:23:11,565
-...to be my husband.
-...to be my husband.

786
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:16,032
l promise to be true to you
in good times and in bad...

787
01:23:16,338 --> 01:23:18,169
...in sickness and in health.

788
01:23:18,407 --> 01:23:19,806
l promise to love you...

789
01:23:20,109 --> 01:23:23,909
...and honor you
till death do us part.

790
01:23:32,454 --> 01:23:33,443
Annie.

791
01:23:35,657 --> 01:23:36,487
Max.

792
01:23:37,626 --> 01:23:40,720
l don't want you to think
l forgot you.

793
01:23:41,630 --> 01:23:46,897
lt's just that l couldn't find you.
l woke up and you were gone.

794
01:23:47,636 --> 01:23:51,800
Everything was gone.
lt just disappeared in one minute.

795
01:23:52,041 --> 01:23:55,670
l couldn't remember that minute.
l lost it.

796
01:23:56,945 --> 01:24:02,212
But l think l found it all now.
l used a calculator, see.

797
01:24:02,951 --> 01:24:06,079
Do you know we get about
1400 minutes a day?

798
01:24:07,289 --> 01:24:10,122
So l figured it out.

799
01:24:10,859 --> 01:24:11,826
l was...

800
01:24:12,861 --> 01:24:14,055
...29 years old...

801
01:24:14,263 --> 01:24:17,061
...three months and eight days.

802
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:22,469
So it was minute number...

803
01:24:22,671 --> 01:24:27,438
...1 7,810,200 or so.

804
01:24:29,178 --> 01:24:31,009
That's the one l lost.

805
01:24:32,281 --> 01:24:35,114
When l lost that minute,
l guess l....

806
01:24:35,317 --> 01:24:37,182
l tried to lose it all...

807
01:24:37,786 --> 01:24:39,219
...all the memories...

808
01:24:39,688 --> 01:24:41,986
...because it hurt so bad.

809
01:24:44,326 --> 01:24:45,953
l tried, but....

810
01:24:52,734 --> 01:24:54,361
But l couldn't do it.

811
01:24:56,705 --> 01:24:59,367
Max, you were sick that day, remember?

812
01:24:59,741 --> 01:25:01,368
lt was your birthday...

813
01:25:03,612 --> 01:25:05,375
...and you ate too much.

814
01:25:15,390 --> 01:25:17,119
Annie, you said:

815
01:25:17,726 --> 01:25:20,593
''Slow down, it's wet, okay?''

816
01:25:21,029 --> 01:25:22,792
And you were right.

817
01:25:23,365 --> 01:25:25,390
l should have slowed down.

818
01:25:27,069 --> 01:25:29,867
l should have slowed down
lots of times.

819
01:25:30,939 --> 01:25:33,066
But l didn't always listen.

820
01:25:34,176 --> 01:25:36,235
l didn't listen when you...

821
01:25:36,845 --> 01:25:41,782
...when you said, ''Steve,
just please spend more time.''

822
01:25:49,191 --> 01:25:52,058
That day l made you smile,
Max, remember?

823
01:25:52,261 --> 01:25:53,990
You looked at me...

824
01:25:54,897 --> 01:25:56,296
...and I made a face...

825
01:25:56,732 --> 01:25:59,098
...and then we all smiled.

826
01:25:59,801 --> 01:26:01,632
lt was a great minute.

827
01:26:01,837 --> 01:26:03,236
lt was.

828
01:26:06,475 --> 01:26:09,467
l'm so glad l found that minute.

829
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,643
And no matter what...

830
01:26:14,183 --> 01:26:17,243
...no matter what,
l won't forget anymore.

831
01:26:23,825 --> 01:26:25,315
Daddy!

832
01:26:57,859 --> 01:26:59,918
l won't forget anymore.

833
01:27:03,265 --> 01:27:04,664
l love you.

834
01:27:50,012 --> 01:27:53,038
Don't make him talk about
anything today.

835
01:27:54,416 --> 01:27:55,405
l know.

836
01:27:58,153 --> 01:27:59,984
lt was a nice ceremony.

837
01:28:02,557 --> 01:28:04,821
We're running out of chicken.

838
01:28:05,394 --> 01:28:07,419
Nobody's eating the ham.

839
01:28:11,033 --> 01:28:13,160
lt's still a great party.

840
01:28:14,536 --> 01:28:15,969
You look happy.

841
01:28:17,472 --> 01:28:20,100
30 years and still in love, huh?

842
01:28:20,575 --> 01:28:23,043
You think that's wrong, don't you?

843
01:28:23,779 --> 01:28:25,144
Of course not.

844
01:28:31,953 --> 01:28:33,147
You're beautiful.

845
01:29:14,796 --> 01:29:15,785
Dad.

846
01:29:19,968 --> 01:29:22,459
-Don't walk away, okay?
-What?

847
01:29:23,171 --> 01:29:25,799
ls it working?
Do you need to check it?

848
01:29:26,575 --> 01:29:27,940
-lt's fine.
-Dad--

849
01:29:28,143 --> 01:29:31,442
-What the hell are you doing?
-Sharon, please.

850
01:29:31,646 --> 01:29:34,979
Please, please what?
Why do you always protect him?

851
01:29:35,183 --> 01:29:36,946
''Don't bother your father.''

852
01:29:37,152 --> 01:29:40,815
l'm gonna bother you for a minute.
Can you handle that?

853
01:29:41,022 --> 01:29:44,890
-You get the hell--
-This is between me and my father.

854
01:29:45,093 --> 01:29:49,462
So both of you, just leave us alone
for one goddamn minute!

855
01:29:55,670 --> 01:29:57,467
How about you, Dad?

856
01:29:58,073 --> 01:29:59,301
You want me to go?

857
01:30:01,343 --> 01:30:04,107
-lt's up to you.
-l'm asking you.

858
01:30:05,046 --> 01:30:06,240
Am l welcome here?

859
01:30:09,818 --> 01:30:11,217
You're here, aren't you?

860
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:14,014
-What do you want?
-l want to know.

861
01:30:15,323 --> 01:30:17,154
Do you want me here?

862
01:30:20,896 --> 01:30:23,888
Do you still love me?
l want to know.

863
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:40,445
l feel like....

864
01:30:43,118 --> 01:30:45,086
You feel like what, Dad?

865
01:30:51,126 --> 01:30:54,027
l feel like l don't
have a daughter anymore.

866
01:30:59,301 --> 01:31:00,290
Well...

867
01:31:02,070 --> 01:31:06,530
...you do. And it's a shame that
you'll miss knowing her.

868
01:31:36,905 --> 01:31:38,099
l'm next.

869
01:31:39,941 --> 01:31:43,877
Hi, Mom, Dad. Congratulations.

870
01:31:45,514 --> 01:31:49,314
You know, being in this house
reminds of something.

871
01:31:49,818 --> 01:31:51,945
l was about 10 years old.

872
01:31:53,622 --> 01:31:56,682
Me and Larry were playing
alien invasion.

873
01:31:57,959 --> 01:31:59,290
Remember, Lar?

874
01:32:00,095 --> 01:32:03,394
Anyway, we were making a lot of noise.

875
01:32:05,066 --> 01:32:08,729
Dad came home from work,
tired and pissed off.

876
01:32:09,604 --> 01:32:11,731
We were yelling like mad.

877
01:32:11,940 --> 01:32:14,807
He burst into the room and he yells:

878
01:32:15,010 --> 01:32:16,875
''What the hell are you doing?''

879
01:32:17,512 --> 01:32:19,002
And l was scared.

880
01:32:20,081 --> 01:32:21,946
l was really scared.

881
01:32:23,385 --> 01:32:24,716
And l said:

882
01:32:26,555 --> 01:32:29,023
''We're playing alien invasion.''

883
01:32:30,191 --> 01:32:34,127
And he said, ''l'll show you
a damn alien invasion!''

884
01:32:35,897 --> 01:32:36,955
He picks me up.

885
01:32:37,165 --> 01:32:40,862
He picks me up off the floor
and he throws me on the couch.

886
01:32:41,069 --> 01:32:46,336
Then he grabs Larry and picks him up
and throws him on the couch.

887
01:32:47,609 --> 01:32:48,871
And then....

888
01:32:50,211 --> 01:32:53,237
Then he starts making monster noises.

889
01:32:55,150 --> 01:32:58,916
He says, ''We came to Earth
to kick ass!''

890
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:03,147
Me and Larry, we're running
and jumping at him.

891
01:33:03,658 --> 01:33:05,489
We're laughing so hard...

892
01:33:05,827 --> 01:33:07,419
...l almost wet myself.

893
01:33:08,697 --> 01:33:13,725
And we keep running and jumping
on him, and he keeps tossing us.

894
01:33:15,103 --> 01:33:17,071
And growling and beeping.

895
01:33:24,279 --> 01:33:25,610
lt was great.

896
01:33:30,318 --> 01:33:31,683
lt was great.

897
01:33:34,456 --> 01:33:36,356
l'll never forget that.

898
01:33:43,765 --> 01:33:45,289
And l miss that.

899
01:33:48,570 --> 01:33:49,764
l miss it.

900
01:33:55,710 --> 01:33:57,439
Anyway, l just...

901
01:33:58,913 --> 01:34:02,041
...wanted to say thanks for that, Dad.

902
01:34:06,154 --> 01:34:07,382
Thanks.

903
01:34:16,598 --> 01:34:17,587
Bye.

904
01:35:24,733 --> 01:35:26,530
What are you doing here?

905
01:35:27,302 --> 01:35:28,997
You invited me.

906
01:35:29,971 --> 01:35:31,165
Are you okay?

907
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:33,271
Yeah, l'm okay.

908
01:35:36,511 --> 01:35:38,342
l wanted to apologize.

909
01:35:39,147 --> 01:35:40,307
For what?

910
01:35:44,085 --> 01:35:49,421
For wanting everything to be perfect.
You were right, l was pushing you.

911
01:35:53,194 --> 01:35:55,219
Then l realized that...

912
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:57,898
...it doesn't have to be perfect.

913
01:35:58,666 --> 01:35:59,496
l mean....

914
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:04,061
lt can be whatever it is.

915
01:36:10,345 --> 01:36:13,143
They don't like me very much
in there.

916
01:36:13,982 --> 01:36:16,610
They're lucky to have you in there.

917
01:36:17,986 --> 01:36:21,422
-That's a nice thing to say.
-lt's not a nice thing.

918
01:36:21,656 --> 01:36:23,123
lt's the truth.

919
01:36:26,628 --> 01:36:29,324
Why do you try so hard not to cry?

920
01:36:34,936 --> 01:36:36,631
lt's not fair.

921
01:36:38,506 --> 01:36:40,235
l did the right thing.

922
01:36:42,143 --> 01:36:43,610
l know l did.

923
01:36:45,013 --> 01:36:48,505
lt's not fair that
they're shutting me out.

924
01:36:56,090 --> 01:36:58,581
There's nothing l can do anymore.

925
01:37:03,798 --> 01:37:05,561
l went, Sharon.

926
01:37:07,869 --> 01:37:11,669
l went to see my wife
and my son today.

927
01:37:13,708 --> 01:37:17,610
l told them that l love them
and that l miss them.

928
01:37:18,847 --> 01:37:21,213
And then l told them about you.

929
01:37:25,887 --> 01:37:28,355
l told them how much l love you.

930
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:46,664
l love you.

931
01:37:51,212 --> 01:37:52,941
l love you too.

932
01:38:35,990 --> 01:38:36,854
l'll drive.
