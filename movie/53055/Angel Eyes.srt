2
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:48,014
You called the dispatcher, right?

3
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:53,022
We've got multiple vehicles,
possible DOAs, multiple injuries.

4
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:58,795
Major accident.
We'll need more ambulances.

5
00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:02,400
All units have been deployed.
I don't have an ETA.

6
00:02:02,602 --> 00:02:05,332
-l need those medics.
-I'll do the best I can.

7
00:02:05,572 --> 00:02:07,403
Just get them over here.

8
00:02:08,742 --> 00:02:10,141
Can you hear me?

9
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:12,942
Listen to me.

10
00:02:13,747 --> 00:02:15,112
Listen to me!

11
00:02:15,982 --> 00:02:17,244
Look at me.

12
00:02:17,517 --> 00:02:19,007
Look in my eyes.

13
00:02:21,288 --> 00:02:22,983
Can you feel that?

14
00:02:23,223 --> 00:02:26,021
That's my hand. Go on, hold it.

15
00:02:26,793 --> 00:02:28,727
We'll get you out of here.

16
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:31,159
l need some help over here!

17
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,209
lt's okay.

18
00:02:54,888 --> 00:02:58,585
You're safe now, all right?
You'll be okay. Just hang on.

19
00:02:58,825 --> 00:03:00,588
All right? You're doing fine.

20
00:03:24,351 --> 00:03:27,787
Don't let go. Don't let me go.
Stay with me.

21
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:29,686
Come on!

22
00:03:31,124 --> 00:03:32,921
Stay with me, all right?

23
00:03:35,996 --> 00:03:37,623
Stay with me.

24
00:03:38,064 --> 00:03:38,894
Good.

25
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:41,797
Stay with me.

26
00:04:04,157 --> 00:04:08,253
-What are you doing? That's my car.
-Nothing, l just--

27
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:10,759
-What'd you take?
-l turned off--

28
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:12,464
Did you take something?

29
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:16,898
-You take my phone, huh?
-Wake up! Wake up! l helped you.

30
00:04:20,206 --> 00:04:21,537
l helped you.

31
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,709
l'm sorry.

32
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,080
That's the fiirst
question people ask.

33
00:04:37,057 --> 00:04:38,991
Have l ever killed anyone?

34
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,153
So casually, like asking me
what kind of car l drive.

35
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:49,528
Why don't they ever ask
if l ever saved anyone?

36
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:52,795
Have you? Saved anyone, l mean.

37
00:04:55,008 --> 00:04:59,411
My mother would argue that
God's the only one that saves.

38
00:05:01,948 --> 00:05:06,112
lt must be pretty exciting, though,
catching bad guys.

39
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,914
ls this all we're gonna talk about?

40
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:13,120
Look, l'm sorry.

41
00:05:16,696 --> 00:05:19,028
l'm not very good at dating.

42
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,726
I take it your date sucked.

43
00:05:56,336 --> 00:05:59,396
l don't need to tell my story
to a stranger.

44
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,472
''What do you do, where are you from?''

45
00:06:03,643 --> 00:06:08,580
Your problem wasn't that he asked
too many questions.

46
00:06:09,215 --> 00:06:12,616
You just didn't want to clean
his little pipes.

47
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:16,050
No, all l wanted
to do was clean his pipes.

48
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:18,814
The conversation pissed me off.

49
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:23,822
Baby girl, if it's a servicing
you need....

50
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,894
Shut the fuck up.

51
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:04,629
We've talked about this every
week for six months.

52
00:07:06,873 --> 00:07:10,741
We've talked about this
a thousand times.

53
00:07:12,178 --> 00:07:14,738
Come on. No!

54
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:22,954
l am not having this conversation
with you again. Hang on.

55
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:26,657
None of your goddamn business.
Hang on.

56
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:28,317
What?

57
00:07:29,062 --> 00:07:31,155
Your keys are in the door.

58
00:07:32,398 --> 00:07:34,866
Then hang up. l don't care.

59
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:39,162
You're in 21 5, right?

60
00:07:40,073 --> 00:07:41,597
Then fuck you!

61
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:45,138
Not you. l'm talking to this idiot.

62
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:51,979
You know what? Don't bother.

63
00:07:57,891 --> 00:07:59,153
Candace.

64
00:08:00,026 --> 00:08:01,015
l'm Catch.

65
00:08:02,595 --> 00:08:03,687
Charlie...

66
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:08,397
...was just about to go to bed,
weren't you?

67
00:08:09,302 --> 00:08:10,291
Bye.

68
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:13,605
And l just ordered a pizza...

69
00:08:13,807 --> 00:08:16,537
...so l don't know if you're hungry--

70
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,704
l gotta go.

71
00:08:25,518 --> 00:08:27,110
See you around.

72
00:08:41,434 --> 00:08:43,459
l didn't see his van, so....

73
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:45,429
Yeah, he's not here.

74
00:08:47,574 --> 00:08:48,700
How you doing?

75
00:08:49,242 --> 00:08:50,209
l'm okay.

76
00:08:51,144 --> 00:08:54,739
And Cathy and Larry, Jr.?
l bet he's big now.

77
00:08:55,048 --> 00:08:56,709
He's growing fast.

78
00:08:58,251 --> 00:09:01,243
Does he look like you,
or did he get lucky?

79
00:09:02,388 --> 00:09:07,018
He's got Cathy's looks and my
strength. You should feel his grip.

80
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:10,427
So what's with the cryptic message?

81
00:09:10,663 --> 00:09:14,030
''Call me, we have to talk.''
Sounds like bad news.

82
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:18,366
Mom and Dad are renewing their vows.

83
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:21,369
Church, priest, the whole thing.

84
00:09:21,774 --> 00:09:23,298
Renewing their vows?

85
00:09:23,776 --> 00:09:26,609
With a party at the house
afterwards.

86
00:09:26,813 --> 00:09:28,212
Mom wants you to come.

87
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:30,142
Does he?

88
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:32,714
We're working on Dad.

89
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,780
Over 10 years,
and he won't let it go--

90
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,926
No, Sharon! l won't go
into that hole with you.

91
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:42,788
l'm over that shit.

92
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:47,698
You're still scared of him.

93
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:55,333
You know what?

94
00:09:55,842 --> 00:09:58,538
You shouldn't come here
in your uniform.

95
00:09:58,745 --> 00:10:01,213
People will think we're in trouble.

96
00:10:05,518 --> 00:10:07,611
-Nice seeing you too.
-Yeah.

97
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:15,616
Cocksucker!

98
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,058
Get off of me!

99
00:10:21,968 --> 00:10:24,129
-l'll kill you!
-Shut up!

100
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:25,797
Motherfuck--

101
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:29,536
l'm gonna bend you over the car,
bitch!

102
00:10:29,742 --> 00:10:31,505
-Motherfucker!
-Shut up.

103
00:10:31,744 --> 00:10:34,508
-You're under arrest!
-Fucking bitch!

104
00:10:35,181 --> 00:10:39,618
You are a crazy one.
You are a pretty one, senorita!

105
00:10:40,186 --> 00:10:42,882
Those honey-brown eyes-- Fuck you!

106
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:48,785
l'll take you in the back
and do you, baby.

107
00:10:48,995 --> 00:10:50,792
You can suck my dick.

108
00:10:51,264 --> 00:10:55,633
This is 7673. We're bringing in
one for processing.

109
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:59,395
Look good in that uniform.
Why don't you take it off?

110
00:10:59,605 --> 00:11:03,063
Take my handcuffs off too,
you fucking bitch!

111
00:11:03,576 --> 00:11:05,874
-Just one touch.
-Cut it out.

112
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,345
You're gonna bust me!
Give me one sweet touch.

113
00:11:13,186 --> 00:11:14,084
Fuck.

114
00:11:14,387 --> 00:11:16,218
Fuck you, faggot.

115
00:11:16,622 --> 00:11:18,715
Smells like bacon in here.

116
00:11:19,192 --> 00:11:22,127
That's not the touch l want, honey!

117
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:25,593
Sit here.
l ain't got time to babysit you.

118
00:11:25,798 --> 00:11:30,667
Put your hand on top of your
head. Turn around. Sit down.

119
00:11:31,237 --> 00:11:32,932
-Sit the fuck down!
-Fuck!

120
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:38,405
Mike, you got another booking sheet?

121
00:11:38,678 --> 00:11:40,236
Fucking bitch!

122
00:11:42,482 --> 00:11:43,813
He needs a rag.

123
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:46,442
Let me talk to you.

124
00:11:46,652 --> 00:11:49,644
Do we need to have another
conversation?

125
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:53,086
You'd just let him
grab your balls?

126
00:11:53,426 --> 00:11:55,826
l saw you plan that in the car.

127
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:58,520
Just waiting to
do something to him.

128
00:11:59,132 --> 00:12:01,999
lf l was out of line,
put it in a report.

129
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:36,195
l hate the graveyard
shift. lt fucks my system.

130
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:39,838
All the shit you eat
is fucking up your system.

131
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:42,166
l love graveyard. No traffic.

132
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:46,573
Nothing's worse than a 459
crosstown during rush hour.

133
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:49,942
Might as well pull over,
because you're gonna be late.

134
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:53,243
You like graveyard because
you have insomnia.

135
00:12:53,453 --> 00:12:55,478
l know what puts me to sleep.

136
00:12:55,688 --> 00:13:00,216
The sound of your own voice?
That puts your wife to sleep.

137
00:13:49,242 --> 00:13:51,676
Get down! Down! Heads down!

138
00:13:55,982 --> 00:13:56,971
Do it now!

139
00:14:01,888 --> 00:14:03,515
Call 91 1 !

140
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:14,497
Stop! Hold it right there!

141
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:17,464
Hold it!

142
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:21,231
-Hold it!
-Heading south, University Field!

143
00:14:26,212 --> 00:14:27,201
Get down!

144
00:14:28,714 --> 00:14:30,181
Wait, damn it!

145
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:31,605
Get up here!

146
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:36,579
Drop the gun!

147
00:14:37,256 --> 00:14:38,780
Drop the gun!

148
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:48,900
Pogo, what's your 20?

149
00:14:49,468 --> 00:14:50,628
Damn it!

150
00:15:32,945 --> 00:15:35,345
This one's for my brother, bitch!

151
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:43,682
Drop the fucking gun!
Drop the fucking gun!

152
00:15:44,624 --> 00:15:49,118
l said drop it! Get up!
Put your hands on top of your head.

153
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:51,819
Pogue, are you all right?
You all right?

154
00:15:52,031 --> 00:15:53,828
Don't you move! Get down!

155
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,961
Stay away from the gun!
Are you all right?

156
00:15:57,169 --> 00:15:59,933
Yeah! l'm good. l'm okay!

157
00:16:00,373 --> 00:16:02,898
Don't move!
Put your hands on your head!

158
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:05,942
-He's okay!
-l told you to wait!

159
00:16:23,229 --> 00:16:26,824
l got you nectarines.
The peaches were as hard as rocks.

160
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:29,359
Your coat's all dirty.

161
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:30,796
l tackled a guy.

162
00:16:31,871 --> 00:16:33,702
Why did you tackle a guy?

163
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:36,136
He was going for a touchdown.

164
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:38,143
Can you be serious?

165
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,778
-What day is it today?
-Wednesday.

166
00:16:41,981 --> 00:16:43,039
No.

167
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:47,411
-l met somebody today.
-Good.

168
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,386
Oh, you got the broccolini.
Thank you.

169
00:16:51,624 --> 00:16:52,818
lt was a woman.

170
00:16:54,093 --> 00:16:56,994
You didn't tackle her too, did you?

171
00:16:57,196 --> 00:17:00,927
-She's a police officer.
-Are you in trouble?

172
00:17:02,435 --> 00:17:06,667
-l don't think so.
-Well, that's a good thing.

173
00:17:11,177 --> 00:17:13,145
l better go now.

174
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:18,611
-See you next week.
-Okay.

175
00:17:29,095 --> 00:17:32,223
Suddenly l see what's happening.

176
00:17:32,431 --> 00:17:34,831
Where are all the baby pigeons?

177
00:17:35,134 --> 00:17:39,901
l see nests with tiny eggs,
but l don't see tiny pigeons. Why?

178
00:17:40,106 --> 00:17:42,666
You always ask the big questions.

179
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:46,606
l got a big question for you.
l can only ask you....

180
00:17:46,812 --> 00:17:50,373
Here, use this. Call your wife.
Ask her instead.

181
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:51,914
lt's the hospital.

182
00:17:53,486 --> 00:17:55,716
Yeah. Gonna be okay?

183
00:17:57,022 --> 00:17:58,011
Yeah.

184
00:17:59,158 --> 00:18:01,126
Brian's gonna be all right.

185
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:04,361
Didn't l tell you? He's tough.

186
00:18:04,563 --> 00:18:06,428
Tomorrow? We'll be there.

187
00:18:06,632 --> 00:18:09,294
-Where's your partner?
-He has a wife.

188
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:13,129
-l got a wife.
-But his wife actually likes him.

189
00:18:13,606 --> 00:18:16,302
-Where you going?
-The head. All right?

190
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:19,069
-To fix her makeup.
-Pogue wears makeup?

191
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:22,770
Right, l need that
lipstick you borrowed back.

192
00:19:04,156 --> 00:19:08,388
l didn't think you'd show.
Why are you sitting here?

193
00:19:09,862 --> 00:19:12,353
l don't talk to a lot of people.

194
00:19:12,898 --> 00:19:15,526
Would you like to sit down?

195
00:19:16,435 --> 00:19:17,993
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

196
00:19:22,274 --> 00:19:26,267
-l didn't thank you. l'm Sharon Pogue.
-l'm Catch.

197
00:19:26,445 --> 00:19:28,379
-Just Catch?
-Just Catch.

198
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:36,483
Why would you do that, Catch?

199
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:40,216
-Jump somebody with a gun?
-He was gonna kill you.

200
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:44,496
He could have killed you.
You got a death wish?

201
00:19:44,697 --> 00:19:48,189
l guess l didn't have time
to think about it.

202
00:19:51,103 --> 00:19:53,298
-Hey!
-Hey, Pogo!

203
00:19:56,775 --> 00:20:01,007
-What do you think about it now?
-lt was worth the risk.

204
00:20:02,448 --> 00:20:05,212
-For somebody you don't even know?
-Yeah.

205
00:20:06,118 --> 00:20:09,417
And for what you do.
l think cops are great.

206
00:20:09,622 --> 00:20:14,116
Trying to keep it safe for everybody.
Tough job. Firemen...

207
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:19,263
...they're heros. lKids wave at them.
People should wave at cops.

208
00:20:23,002 --> 00:20:25,300
-What are you laughing at?
-Nothing.

209
00:20:25,738 --> 00:20:29,970
Ever think of how many people
are here because you saved them?

210
00:20:30,209 --> 00:20:35,010
Or helped them, or arrested
somebody who would've hurt them?

211
00:20:36,682 --> 00:20:41,415
-Never thought about it.
-Or just because you did your job.

212
00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:46,281
Now l'm walking around
because of you.

213
00:20:46,492 --> 00:20:48,357
Maybe you should be the cop.

214
00:20:50,763 --> 00:20:55,291
Wow, l don't know.
l don't look really good in hats.

215
00:21:04,877 --> 00:21:09,041
What do you do? Where do you live?
Where do you work?

216
00:21:12,952 --> 00:21:13,941
Okay.

217
00:21:15,888 --> 00:21:16,912
l'm sorry.

218
00:21:17,523 --> 00:21:22,460
Every time l talk to people, it comes
out like an interrogation.

219
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:27,663
You have a nice smile.

220
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:30,824
Thank you.

221
00:21:35,574 --> 00:21:39,635
-You gonna let us meet your hero?
-Catch, this is Ray.

222
00:21:40,312 --> 00:21:42,246
-Hi, Ray.
-Catch.

223
00:21:43,248 --> 00:21:46,775
Why don't you join us?
We want to buy you dinner...

224
00:21:46,986 --> 00:21:49,318
...for saving Pogo's ass.

225
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:56,684
You know, l'm kind of tired.
l'm gonna head home.

226
00:21:59,198 --> 00:22:02,065
-Did l interrupt something?
-All right.

227
00:22:02,267 --> 00:22:05,498
l'll walk you to your car
if you'd like.

228
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:07,467
Yeah. Sure.

229
00:22:12,344 --> 00:22:16,508
lt's a bad neighborhood.
Maybe l should walk you to your car.

230
00:22:16,715 --> 00:22:18,342
l don't have a car.

231
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,245
You want a ride home?

232
00:22:21,487 --> 00:22:24,183
No, thank you. l'd like to walk.

233
00:22:26,392 --> 00:22:28,360
Are you okay to drive?

234
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:30,128
l'm not drunk.

235
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:34,729
You think l am? You'll know when
l'm drunk. l'll be throwing up.

236
00:22:34,933 --> 00:22:37,026
And l never throw up, so....

237
00:22:39,004 --> 00:22:40,938
Don't worry about it, okay?

238
00:22:43,242 --> 00:22:45,267
Get in the car, will you?

239
00:23:00,225 --> 00:23:02,523
l'm on Ashland, off 18th street.

240
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:19,605
-l never drive.
-Why not?

241
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:30,010
What?

242
00:23:30,422 --> 00:23:33,914
l was trying to picture you
without your clothes.

243
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,356
-Excuse me?
-l didn't mean it like that.

244
00:23:37,563 --> 00:23:41,124
l mean, l'm trying to picture
you out of uniform.

245
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,165
On your day off,
in regular clothes.

246
00:23:55,914 --> 00:23:57,677
l don't live here.

247
00:23:58,684 --> 00:24:00,914
l know. This is where l live.

248
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:08,690
You know those guys at the bar?
They're my friends.

249
00:24:10,329 --> 00:24:15,266
Sort of. We work together,
we tell jokes, we bullshit.

250
00:24:17,636 --> 00:24:19,263
l can't say to them....

251
00:24:20,405 --> 00:24:21,372
What?

252
00:24:26,478 --> 00:24:30,175
Every time l shut my eyes,
l see that damn gun.

253
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:32,674
l hear that pop.

254
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:37,752
l feel a bullet slamming
into my chest and....

255
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,254
l don't know why l'm telling you,
except you were there....

256
00:24:51,603 --> 00:24:52,934
l must be drunk.

257
00:24:59,044 --> 00:25:04,107
l want to know why you were walking
by the stadium at that minute.

258
00:25:07,986 --> 00:25:10,454
What if you hadn't been there?

259
00:25:12,724 --> 00:25:15,215
l guess we were supposed to meet.

260
00:25:19,832 --> 00:25:22,699
lf you want, you can come in
for a bit.

261
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:24,836
Okay.

262
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,110
-You want a drink?
-No, thanks.

263
00:25:36,014 --> 00:25:37,982
Mind getting the door?

264
00:25:43,922 --> 00:25:45,753
Sit down or something.

265
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:48,724
l'm circling a while.

266
00:25:56,068 --> 00:25:58,901
Don't look.
l didn't straighten up.

267
00:25:59,104 --> 00:26:02,005
So? lt's more real this way.

268
00:26:03,141 --> 00:26:04,267
lt's rude.

269
00:26:05,577 --> 00:26:08,273
Now l'm here, you seem mad about it.

270
00:26:09,314 --> 00:26:12,078
Trust me, when l'm mad,
you'll know it.

271
00:26:14,086 --> 00:26:15,576
lt's just l'm not...

272
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:18,821
...used to letting anybody up here.

273
00:26:19,925 --> 00:26:22,553
But you're here, so....
Anyway....

274
00:26:22,961 --> 00:26:26,397
-Let's talk about something stupid.
-You first.

275
00:26:31,303 --> 00:26:36,104
What's that ''supposed to'' business?
That we were supposed to meet?

276
00:26:36,408 --> 00:26:41,107
lt sounds a little too
Psychic Friends Network to me.

277
00:26:43,582 --> 00:26:47,518
Some people say we each give off
a particular odor...

278
00:26:47,753 --> 00:26:51,849
...that can only be detected
by one other person's brain.

279
00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:57,292
So we smell each other.

280
00:26:58,964 --> 00:27:01,432
-Who says that?
-l have no idea.

281
00:27:10,008 --> 00:27:11,532
You're crazy.

282
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:25,856
Thanks for coming up here.

283
00:27:27,826 --> 00:27:29,851
Does that mean l'm going?

284
00:27:30,595 --> 00:27:33,530
No! l mean, you don't have to.

285
00:27:33,732 --> 00:27:37,998
-So you're okay now.
-What, are you here as a medic?

286
00:27:39,438 --> 00:27:41,531
ls this the ''mad'' part?

287
00:27:45,677 --> 00:27:47,702
Maybe going is a good idea.

288
00:27:56,154 --> 00:27:58,145
Can l come back sometime?

289
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:59,357
Why?

290
00:28:02,494 --> 00:28:04,223
Must be the smell.

291
00:28:44,636 --> 00:28:45,830
l gotta go.

292
00:28:52,944 --> 00:28:54,434
Oh, God....

293
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:17,427
What's the matter, you blind?

294
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:19,268
Fucking idiot.

295
00:30:14,426 --> 00:30:16,485
What are you guys doing here?

296
00:30:16,728 --> 00:30:17,695
Hey, you!

297
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,927
Your mom's been bugging us
to come for lunch.

298
00:30:22,134 --> 00:30:25,535
-Mom, can we go now?
-ln a minute.

299
00:30:28,006 --> 00:30:29,439
So how is she?

300
00:30:29,741 --> 00:30:33,939
She's really good.
She'll be happy to see you.

301
00:30:35,547 --> 00:30:36,980
My dad's not here?

302
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:42,179
So you talked to Larry? He told me.

303
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:46,948
Yeah. He told me about this
renewing-the-vows thing.

304
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:49,727
You're gonna come, l hope?

305
00:30:51,163 --> 00:30:53,723
Come, Shar.
l think you should.

306
00:31:00,438 --> 00:31:03,202
Aunt Sharon, can l see
your police car?

307
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:10,371
-Come on, Mom!
-Hold on. l gotta go.

308
00:31:10,582 --> 00:31:11,412
Bye.

309
00:31:36,508 --> 00:31:37,770
Looks the same.

310
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:41,142
Still smells like cigarettes.

311
00:31:41,713 --> 00:31:44,341
-Thought he quit.
-Only six a day.

312
00:31:50,922 --> 00:31:54,824
Larry told you l stopped by?
ls that why you called?

313
00:31:55,227 --> 00:31:59,630
l called you because we want you
to come when we renew our vows.

314
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:03,758
How come you're renewing your vows?

315
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:09,439
lt's a sort of a fresh start.

316
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:11,065
Your idea?

317
00:32:12,644 --> 00:32:13,633
Both of us.

318
00:32:14,646 --> 00:32:17,638
lt's a way of having
the marriage blessed.

319
00:32:18,016 --> 00:32:19,950
Wasn't it blessed before?

320
00:32:23,521 --> 00:32:26,456
Of course it was blessed before.

321
00:32:29,761 --> 00:32:31,285
You just....

322
00:32:32,297 --> 00:32:35,858
-l just what, Ma?
-You just think of the bad.

323
00:32:36,067 --> 00:32:40,231
You never remember the good.
l wish you remembered that.

324
00:32:40,472 --> 00:32:42,906
l wish l remembered it too.

325
00:32:44,075 --> 00:32:48,034
Does Dad? Does he remember
anything good about me?

326
00:32:50,949 --> 00:32:52,940
He doesn't hate you.

327
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:57,819
-He just still feels hurt.
-Hurt?

328
00:32:58,223 --> 00:32:59,315
l hurt him?

329
00:33:00,492 --> 00:33:04,656
Being arrested like that?
Nobody forgets that.

330
00:33:04,896 --> 00:33:07,387
How did you forget what he did to you?

331
00:33:07,932 --> 00:33:09,923
lt wasn't as bad--

332
00:33:10,702 --> 00:33:16,038
You make it sound worse.
lt hadn't been like this for years.

333
00:33:16,241 --> 00:33:19,938
l'm glad it hasn't been that way.
That means it worked!

334
00:33:20,145 --> 00:33:21,669
That's why l did it!

335
00:33:22,914 --> 00:33:25,644
Why do l get punished for this?

336
00:33:28,353 --> 00:33:30,321
Nobody's punishing you.

337
00:33:32,324 --> 00:33:34,019
We're inviting you.

338
00:33:36,261 --> 00:33:37,387
Will you come?

339
00:34:52,771 --> 00:34:55,035
-Do you have a machine?
-What?

340
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,868
-Do you have an answering machine?
-Yes.

341
00:34:58,109 --> 00:35:01,272
Hang up, and l'll call your machine.

342
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:02,468
Why?

343
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:18,086
Please leave a message after the tone.

344
00:35:19,397 --> 00:35:20,989
lt's Sharon.

345
00:35:22,033 --> 00:35:23,967
Maybe we can...

346
00:35:24,502 --> 00:35:27,403
...have breakfast or something.

347
00:35:27,605 --> 00:35:31,302
I usually get up early
to run in Lincoln Park.

348
00:35:31,509 --> 00:35:34,342
There's a coffee shop
across the street.

349
00:35:35,547 --> 00:35:39,506
Like 8 or so?
If you're there, you're there.

350
00:35:59,804 --> 00:36:02,773
Please leave a message
after the tone.

351
00:36:02,974 --> 00:36:05,841
Hi. Don'tpick up. Look...

352
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:09,306
...I didn't get much sleep...

353
00:36:09,514 --> 00:36:12,574
...and maybe this was
a bad idea anyway.

354
00:36:12,851 --> 00:36:16,048
I was feeling kind of weird
last night.

355
00:36:16,254 --> 00:36:18,245
Anyway, I'm fiine now.

356
00:36:18,456 --> 00:36:21,823
So let's just leave it where it's at.

357
00:36:33,805 --> 00:36:34,794
Fuck!

358
00:36:36,808 --> 00:36:37,797
What?

359
00:36:40,311 --> 00:36:42,074
Who is it? What?

360
00:36:49,721 --> 00:36:52,781
l was just getting to sleep, finally.

361
00:36:53,658 --> 00:36:54,852
We made a date.

362
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,925
lt wasn't a date.

363
00:36:57,128 --> 00:36:59,858
An appointment.
l keep my appointments.

364
00:37:00,064 --> 00:37:04,194
Do you have door issues?
l called you at 7:00.

365
00:37:04,402 --> 00:37:08,304
l get up early. l walked there.
l waited for you.

366
00:37:08,506 --> 00:37:10,337
Check your messages.

367
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:14,237
l need sleep. Come back in a month.

368
00:37:14,445 --> 00:37:18,711
-Why do you think l'd come back?
-Why are you here?

369
00:37:19,517 --> 00:37:22,748
When you tell somebody
you'll be somewhere...

370
00:37:22,954 --> 00:37:26,185
...that person rearranges his life.
Be aware of that.

371
00:37:26,391 --> 00:37:28,985
-And more considerate--
-What's in the bag?

372
00:37:29,193 --> 00:37:30,285
What?

373
00:37:30,595 --> 00:37:33,894
-What's in the bag?
-None of your business.

374
00:37:34,532 --> 00:37:35,521
Got coffee?

375
00:37:36,701 --> 00:37:38,862
You think you deserve coffee?

376
00:37:41,072 --> 00:37:42,437
What about food?

377
00:37:44,008 --> 00:37:46,636
You definitely don't deserve food.

378
00:37:48,112 --> 00:37:51,980
-l got coffee, sugar, sweetener--
-Black.

379
00:37:53,117 --> 00:37:55,551
-Whatever.
-Just black.

380
00:37:57,555 --> 00:38:01,753
So what kind of life
did you rearrange to get coffee?

381
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,591
You never talk about yourself.
What do you do?

382
00:38:05,797 --> 00:38:09,927
-What's the difference?
-What's the difference?

383
00:38:10,735 --> 00:38:15,069
You're standing in my bedroom,
looking through my panty drawer.

384
00:38:15,273 --> 00:38:16,968
That's the difference.

385
00:38:17,742 --> 00:38:18,731
Who are you?

386
00:38:20,411 --> 00:38:22,879
Somebody who keeps his appointments.

387
00:38:24,616 --> 00:38:26,584
Shit, you're married!

388
00:38:28,786 --> 00:38:31,550
Give me my coffee.
Give it here.

389
00:38:32,824 --> 00:38:33,813
What--!

390
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,036
l know, you're a criminal.
Probably a felon.

391
00:38:46,237 --> 00:38:49,070
That's great.
That's all l need.

392
00:38:50,341 --> 00:38:53,606
My name is Catch.
l don't commit crimes.

393
00:38:53,945 --> 00:38:55,913
l like being with you.

394
00:38:56,214 --> 00:38:57,340
That's bullshit.

395
00:38:59,017 --> 00:39:00,541
l let you in here.

396
00:39:00,752 --> 00:39:04,984
l'm not gonna know anything
about you? l need details.

397
00:39:05,189 --> 00:39:08,852
-l need to start from here.
-That's ridiculous! Why?

398
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,060
Because that's the way it is.

399
00:39:13,631 --> 00:39:14,825
Oh, your rules.

400
00:39:18,002 --> 00:39:19,128
My rules.

401
00:39:21,105 --> 00:39:25,132
Fine, l didn't want to know you
that much anyway.

402
00:39:27,378 --> 00:39:29,972
l don't need this shit. l'm tired.

403
00:39:30,782 --> 00:39:32,943
Haven't slept all night.

404
00:39:42,694 --> 00:39:43,524
Bye.

405
00:40:29,741 --> 00:40:31,106
Can l come in?

406
00:40:31,976 --> 00:40:33,466
Yeah. Come in.

407
00:40:35,179 --> 00:40:36,168
Thanks.

408
00:40:36,948 --> 00:40:39,473
Get that door thing under control.

409
00:40:43,454 --> 00:40:44,580
You live here?

410
00:40:47,692 --> 00:40:51,753
Nobody lives here. What is this,
some kind of front?

411
00:40:51,963 --> 00:40:55,262
-ls this what you told me about?
-What?

412
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,265
Your interrogation.
So do l need a lawyer?

413
00:41:00,738 --> 00:41:03,172
l don't like being jerked around.

414
00:41:03,608 --> 00:41:04,597
l'm not.

415
00:41:06,144 --> 00:41:08,874
Then tell me straight.
Who are you?

416
00:41:09,547 --> 00:41:11,276
What are you looking for?

417
00:41:12,416 --> 00:41:15,249
Your life.
l don't want any surprises.

418
00:41:16,053 --> 00:41:20,615
This is it. l sleep here. l walk
around town. That's all.

419
00:41:24,228 --> 00:41:25,991
That's all of it?

420
00:41:28,466 --> 00:41:29,933
Except for you.

421
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:32,930
The way l feel about you.

422
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,629
Which is...?

423
00:41:40,011 --> 00:41:44,345
Surprising.
l thought it was impossible.

424
00:41:46,851 --> 00:41:48,409
l thought l was....

425
00:41:50,521 --> 00:41:53,046
You thought you were what? Gay?

426
00:41:56,427 --> 00:41:57,553
Dead.

427
00:41:59,163 --> 00:42:01,563
Am l supposed to understand that?

428
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,665
No, you're not.

429
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:07,963
Do you ever wonder
what ''scratch'' means?

430
00:42:08,172 --> 00:42:13,166
What people mean when they say,
''Let's start from scratch''?

431
00:42:13,377 --> 00:42:15,072
This is scratch.

432
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:21,248
This is scratch, all right.

433
00:42:28,726 --> 00:42:33,356
-So this cat knows where you live?
-He's not dangerous.

434
00:42:33,564 --> 00:42:37,660
He's in no databases.
There's no Catch anywhere--

435
00:42:37,869 --> 00:42:40,201
You ran his name through?

436
00:42:40,404 --> 00:42:43,771
-He's a ghost.
-l can't believe you did that!

437
00:42:43,975 --> 00:42:48,912
-l'm just looking out for you.
-l don't need you to look out for me.

438
00:42:51,382 --> 00:42:54,078
No last name. That shit's weird.

439
00:43:03,361 --> 00:43:05,192
Oh, l remember that.

440
00:43:05,396 --> 00:43:07,557
That was a smile.

441
00:43:07,765 --> 00:43:11,462
You know the cop? The woman cop?
She visited me.

442
00:43:13,004 --> 00:43:14,562
You're seeing her?

443
00:43:15,106 --> 00:43:19,042
She asks lots of questions.
She wants to know everything.

444
00:43:19,243 --> 00:43:21,734
Of course she does. Everybody does.

445
00:43:22,713 --> 00:43:24,146
Talk to her.

446
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:29,147
-Talk to her about what?
-Talk to her, Catch.

447
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,956
Talk to somebody.
lt's been almost a year.

448
00:43:33,691 --> 00:43:37,127
Every time l talk to somebody,
it gets a little easier.

449
00:43:37,328 --> 00:43:39,819
l'm not saying it goes away--

450
00:43:44,001 --> 00:43:45,059
She nice?

451
00:43:48,005 --> 00:43:48,994
She's...

452
00:43:49,407 --> 00:43:50,738
...tough.

453
00:43:51,575 --> 00:43:52,837
She pretty?

454
00:43:54,912 --> 00:43:56,641
That doesn't matter.

455
00:43:58,182 --> 00:43:59,740
She's pretty.

456
00:44:01,819 --> 00:44:04,151
She's sort of pissed off at me.

457
00:44:04,355 --> 00:44:05,720
Apologize.

458
00:44:06,557 --> 00:44:08,650
-For what?
-lt doesn't matter.

459
00:44:09,827 --> 00:44:12,591
We like it when men apologize.

460
00:44:47,331 --> 00:44:49,492
l thought l'd get your machine.

461
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,726
Want to call back?
I won't answer.

462
00:44:54,672 --> 00:44:56,537
l thought you'd be working.

463
00:44:57,241 --> 00:44:59,266
l wish l was.

464
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:00,841
Can't sleep?

465
00:45:03,047 --> 00:45:04,105
Me neither.

466
00:45:05,449 --> 00:45:07,280
Want to go somewhere?

467
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,083
Now? lt's 3 a.m.
The whole world is sleeping.

468
00:45:14,392 --> 00:45:15,950
Not the whole world.

469
00:45:17,828 --> 00:45:19,159
ls this a date?

470
00:45:20,498 --> 00:45:22,329
Just an appointment.

471
00:45:47,091 --> 00:45:49,184
We can rest, if you want.

472
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,621
Well, then rest.

473
00:45:51,962 --> 00:45:53,259
See you later.

474
00:45:57,435 --> 00:45:59,494
l wish we could go swimming.

475
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:01,237
Why can't we?

476
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:03,466
ln our clothes?

477
00:46:04,542 --> 00:46:09,036
Oh, my God! You can't take off
your clothes in a state park!

478
00:46:10,748 --> 00:46:13,148
You need to learn to take a day off.

479
00:46:14,452 --> 00:46:15,282
Come on!

480
00:46:16,954 --> 00:46:18,785
Where are you going?

481
00:46:21,759 --> 00:46:22,919
l'm gonna tell!

482
00:47:05,035 --> 00:47:06,024
Oh, my God.

483
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:13,999
Oh, God!

484
00:47:21,152 --> 00:47:22,380
Freezing!

485
00:47:31,595 --> 00:47:34,496
lKiss me someplace
l've never been kissed.

486
00:48:09,567 --> 00:48:12,400
lKiss me someplace
l've never been kissed.

487
00:49:31,849 --> 00:49:32,816
Thank you.

488
00:49:35,185 --> 00:49:39,485
What did l tell you about leaving
the apartment without me?

489
00:49:40,391 --> 00:49:41,358
Gotta go.

490
00:49:52,169 --> 00:49:56,196
1034 to Rob-67, location confiirmed
as Pogue residence...

491
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,898
...possible 415.
Neighbor is standing outside.

492
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,785
-Where's Larry?
-Calm down.

493
00:50:11,989 --> 00:50:14,958
-Where is he?
-We waited to book him.

494
00:50:15,192 --> 00:50:17,387
-Where is he?
-You gonna calm down?

495
00:50:17,594 --> 00:50:20,324
Don't talk to me like l'm a child!

496
00:50:20,564 --> 00:50:22,555
He's out back with Denny.

497
00:50:24,234 --> 00:50:27,499
lKathy's inside with the kid.
Vanessa's with him.

498
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:32,608
l'm gonna kill you!

499
00:50:40,984 --> 00:50:43,214
l'm getting nowhere with her.

500
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,149
-Maybe you can try.
-Got it.

501
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:47,648
Are you okay?

502
00:50:48,659 --> 00:50:52,857
Neighbors moved in two weeks ago,
and they're calling the police.

503
00:50:53,063 --> 00:50:54,826
Welcome to the neighborhood.

504
00:50:55,032 --> 00:50:59,162
-Must've gotten pretty loud.
-We had a fight. People fight.

505
00:51:01,138 --> 00:51:02,765
Why don't you tell me--

506
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:04,564
Oh, my--

507
00:51:06,343 --> 00:51:07,310
Shit!

508
00:51:07,644 --> 00:51:10,909
-Don't make it worse.
-lt gets worse?

509
00:51:11,615 --> 00:51:15,676
-lt's never happened before.
-Oh, first time for everything.

510
00:51:15,919 --> 00:51:19,980
Don't fucking patronize me.
l don't need this shit.

511
00:51:25,062 --> 00:51:27,997
-Look at you.
- Look at you, in my house!

512
00:51:28,198 --> 00:51:31,634
Policing my family!
Where do you get off?

513
00:51:32,035 --> 00:51:34,469
lt's me. l didn't hit you.

514
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,076
l don't want your fucking pity, okay?

515
00:51:40,444 --> 00:51:44,244
lt happened, all right?
He's torn up about it.

516
00:51:44,882 --> 00:51:48,841
He's torn up about it? Fuck him!
He's torn up?

517
00:51:50,654 --> 00:51:52,713
Has he hit Larry, Jr. yet?

518
00:51:54,691 --> 00:51:58,559
He'd never do that.
He's a good man, Sharon.

519
00:51:58,829 --> 00:52:01,297
That's what my mother said to us.

520
00:52:01,498 --> 00:52:04,899
''Your father's a good man.
He's torn up about it.''

521
00:52:07,171 --> 00:52:11,403
Get out of my house.
Get the fuck out of my house!

522
00:52:20,217 --> 00:52:22,549
Have you looked into counseling?

523
00:52:22,753 --> 00:52:26,211
-Want to hit a woman? Hit me!
-Fuck! Here we go.

524
00:52:26,457 --> 00:52:27,583
-Calm--
-Back off.

525
00:52:27,825 --> 00:52:31,659
-lt was an accident.
-lt looks more like a car accident.

526
00:52:31,862 --> 00:52:33,830
-Very funny. Look--
-Shut up!

527
00:52:34,565 --> 00:52:37,193
You disgust me, you fucking coward!

528
00:52:37,701 --> 00:52:39,168
You're a fucking cunt!

529
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:42,564
-What are you doing?
-Let go! Get off!

530
00:52:42,806 --> 00:52:44,273
You guys saw that.

531
00:52:44,475 --> 00:52:47,876
You saw that.
You're witnesses. That's assault!

532
00:52:48,846 --> 00:52:50,677
l'll press charges.

533
00:52:50,881 --> 00:52:52,849
Let him press charges!

534
00:52:53,083 --> 00:52:56,052
What are you talking about?
l'm bleeding!

535
00:52:56,253 --> 00:52:59,313
l saw nothing.
l saw you trip and fall.

536
00:53:01,225 --> 00:53:03,193
Look at her! She's crazy!

537
00:53:03,427 --> 00:53:08,023
You lay a hand on her again
and l'll arrest you myself!

538
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,497
You're just like him!

539
00:53:12,402 --> 00:53:14,700
Yeah, and what about you?

540
00:53:23,146 --> 00:53:24,170
Get some help.

541
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:29,813
Okay. All right.
Thanks for coming down.

542
00:54:44,294 --> 00:54:48,196
My mother always said
it was a family thing.

543
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:54,000
That l'd broken some kind of
sacred oath. l don't know.

544
00:54:56,373 --> 00:55:00,867
When we walked in that day
and saw him beating her....

545
00:55:06,917 --> 00:55:09,215
What was l supposed to do?

546
00:55:13,023 --> 00:55:17,619
Larry was the one who'd always
jump in and protect her.

547
00:55:18,428 --> 00:55:20,589
And he always paid for it.

548
00:55:24,434 --> 00:55:26,527
l never did anything.

549
00:55:28,705 --> 00:55:31,640
l just ran and hide.

550
00:55:31,842 --> 00:55:36,176
You did the right thing.
You called for help.

551
00:55:36,413 --> 00:55:38,643
A lot of good it did me.

552
00:55:39,549 --> 00:55:41,813
But you didn't do it for you.

553
00:55:51,962 --> 00:55:54,089
All those years...

554
00:55:59,202 --> 00:56:01,227
...my dad never hurt me.

555
00:56:02,472 --> 00:56:03,461
Not once.

556
00:56:07,144 --> 00:56:08,611
Yes, he did.

557
00:56:29,566 --> 00:56:31,534
Stop right there! Stop!

558
00:56:32,869 --> 00:56:33,836
Freeze!

559
00:56:36,406 --> 00:56:37,373
Shit!

560
00:56:37,607 --> 00:56:41,270
l got constitutionality issues
for my attorney!

561
00:56:41,511 --> 00:56:44,309
Mr. Steak lKnife
has ''constitutionality issues.''

562
00:56:44,514 --> 00:56:46,141
Bitch, that ain't mine.

563
00:56:46,383 --> 00:56:47,714
Watch your mouth.

564
00:56:49,219 --> 00:56:52,347
He's trying to stick up for his lady.

565
00:56:52,589 --> 00:56:56,548
You want to share love with your
partner, right, Officer Ho?

566
00:56:56,793 --> 00:57:01,321
-Ho! Officer Ho!
-Or Officer Bitch? Which one is it?

567
00:57:01,531 --> 00:57:02,930
You ain't seen nothing.

568
00:57:03,533 --> 00:57:06,297
Fuck up your life, l don't care.

569
00:57:06,536 --> 00:57:09,562
You want this life
for your little brother?

570
00:57:09,773 --> 00:57:14,039
Banging until he's shot in the head
like your older brother?

571
00:57:15,011 --> 00:57:17,172
He's a kid. He's got a chance.

572
00:57:17,647 --> 00:57:22,448
-l ain't got a chance?
-No, l'm saying this is your chance.

573
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:26,189
Are you smart enough to recognize it?

574
00:57:35,832 --> 00:57:37,766
Come on, get in back.

575
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:42,804
What, you found God or something?

576
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:45,473
Don't bust my balls, all right?

577
00:58:05,629 --> 00:58:06,618
Come in!

578
00:58:15,005 --> 00:58:17,565
Hey, you got some new furniture.

579
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:23,670
-And a new friend. Who's this?
-Bob.

580
00:58:25,048 --> 00:58:28,415
-You named your dog Bob.
-No, that was his name.

581
00:58:29,019 --> 00:58:31,112
-He told you that?
-Yeah.

582
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:42,430
l got something too. An invitation
to my parents' renewal of vows.

583
00:58:42,666 --> 00:58:46,568
lt came today.
Found it the mailbox this morning.

584
00:58:47,671 --> 00:58:48,933
Are you gonna go?

585
00:58:51,041 --> 00:58:52,235
l don't know.

586
00:58:53,677 --> 00:58:54,871
Would you?

587
00:58:56,112 --> 00:58:58,637
Are you asking me to go with you?

588
00:59:00,483 --> 00:59:02,041
Why, would you do that?

589
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,212
Can Bob come?

590
00:59:09,025 --> 00:59:10,014
Sure.

591
00:59:13,296 --> 00:59:15,389
Now that we got that settled....

592
00:59:15,765 --> 00:59:17,426
Feed me. l'm hungry.

593
00:59:18,101 --> 00:59:19,864
l'll get my jacket.

594
00:59:25,075 --> 00:59:28,340
And change your T-shirt.
You smell like dog.

595
01:00:12,389 --> 01:00:13,913
What are you doing?

596
01:00:15,158 --> 01:00:18,616
-What's with the toys?
-Don't go through my things.

597
01:00:18,828 --> 01:00:20,796
l wasn't. lt was open.

598
01:00:22,632 --> 01:00:24,827
Why do you have all these toys?

599
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,308
l didn't mean to upset you.

600
01:00:36,346 --> 01:00:37,472
Come on.

601
01:00:38,248 --> 01:00:39,545
Let's just go.

602
01:00:46,523 --> 01:00:47,512
What?

603
01:00:48,658 --> 01:00:49,647
Nothing.

604
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:51,249
Let's go.

605
01:00:52,062 --> 01:00:53,222
Be good, Bob.

606
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:02,704
-You know everybody?
-How you doing?

607
01:01:02,906 --> 01:01:04,533
Going uphill, man.

608
01:01:04,874 --> 01:01:06,341
-You try it.
-No....

609
01:01:06,543 --> 01:01:07,532
Go ahead.

610
01:01:10,447 --> 01:01:12,244
l feel like a jerk.

611
01:01:13,183 --> 01:01:14,377
Try again.

612
01:01:24,761 --> 01:01:25,750
What?

613
01:01:26,863 --> 01:01:28,660
You like blues?

614
01:01:29,699 --> 01:01:31,599
Come on, let's go in.

615
01:01:33,203 --> 01:01:34,192
Come on.

616
01:01:47,017 --> 01:01:49,713
Take off your coat.
Let's stay a while.

617
01:01:55,558 --> 01:01:56,547
Come on.

618
01:06:10,013 --> 01:06:13,278
That was incredible!
l didn't know you played.

619
01:06:13,483 --> 01:06:16,008
-Why didn't you tell me?
-l don't know.

620
01:06:16,219 --> 01:06:19,655
-Why'd you leave? lt was great!
-Steve!

621
01:06:19,856 --> 01:06:23,451
Oh, man, l don't believe this!
Steve Lambert!

622
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:26,288
How you doing? You okay?
lt's been--

623
01:06:26,496 --> 01:06:29,465
You have me confused with
somebody else.

624
01:06:29,666 --> 01:06:32,191
You kidding me? Stevie, it's me.

625
01:06:32,402 --> 01:06:34,836
-Tony!
-l don't know a Steve.

626
01:06:36,539 --> 01:06:37,631
ls it a joke?

627
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:42,368
l was up in my office and
l heard that sound, your sound.

628
01:06:42,912 --> 01:06:44,880
l don't know who you are.

629
01:06:45,081 --> 01:06:46,639
Get away from me!

630
01:06:49,185 --> 01:06:51,551
You mind explaining this to me?

631
01:06:51,754 --> 01:06:55,121
Who is that?
You owe him money or something?

632
01:06:56,359 --> 01:06:58,122
l don't know who he is.

633
01:06:59,062 --> 01:07:00,529
ls your name Steve?

634
01:07:02,098 --> 01:07:03,827
My name's Catch.

635
01:07:04,701 --> 01:07:06,692
-What do you want?
-The truth!

636
01:07:07,136 --> 01:07:09,604
-Who's Steve Lambert?
-l don't know.

637
01:07:10,473 --> 01:07:12,532
Are we living some kind of lie?

638
01:07:12,742 --> 01:07:15,836
What'll l find out next?
That you are married?

639
01:07:20,216 --> 01:07:23,652
-Where are you going?
-What do you want me to say?

640
01:07:23,853 --> 01:07:27,584
l don't want you to say anything!
Don't say anything.

641
01:07:29,625 --> 01:07:32,093
You want to go? Go.

642
01:10:42,018 --> 01:10:45,112
Please leave a message after the tone.

643
01:10:45,321 --> 01:10:47,983
Catch, it's me. Can you pick up?

644
01:10:51,928 --> 01:10:55,625
Listen, I was wondering if
we could meet tomorrow.

645
01:10:55,831 --> 01:11:00,063
At this place called Enrico's.
It's on Halsted and Marion.

646
01:11:01,203 --> 01:11:03,000
Around 2:00, okay?

647
01:11:05,641 --> 01:11:06,630
Okay.

648
01:11:07,944 --> 01:11:08,933
Bye.

649
01:11:46,816 --> 01:11:50,252
-About the other day--
-You don't have to explain.

650
01:11:50,453 --> 01:11:51,977
l probably do.

651
01:11:52,755 --> 01:11:55,087
But.... l'm fine.

652
01:12:00,396 --> 01:12:01,488
Come on.

653
01:12:05,201 --> 01:12:07,726
l thought we were having coffee.

654
01:12:07,937 --> 01:12:10,929
-You can trust me, you know.
-l know that.

655
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:13,799
l'd never hurt you.

656
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:22,440
Remember when you said some people
were meant to meet each other?

657
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:28,256
Maybe we were meant to
meet that night.

658
01:12:29,291 --> 01:12:31,122
The night l held your hand.

659
01:12:32,428 --> 01:12:33,895
What do you mean?

660
01:12:36,198 --> 01:12:37,756
Maybe you don't remember.

661
01:12:37,967 --> 01:12:41,403
-You were unconscious--
-No, l don't.

662
01:12:42,438 --> 01:12:43,928
l was there.

663
01:12:45,408 --> 01:12:48,070
lt was me that was there that night.

664
01:12:48,577 --> 01:12:50,010
At the accident?

665
01:12:52,848 --> 01:12:54,839
What are you talking about?

666
01:12:55,484 --> 01:12:58,282
-Maybe it's why we met again.
-What are you doing?

667
01:12:58,487 --> 01:13:00,978
-Trying to help.
-With what? l'm fine.

668
01:13:01,190 --> 01:13:04,956
-l don't think you are. You pretend--
-l'm not pretending!

669
01:13:05,161 --> 01:13:07,186
-You're lying.
-l'm not lying!

670
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:11,662
Then walk in there. And l'll
walk in there with you.

671
01:13:11,867 --> 01:13:15,234
-Why are you doing this?
-Because you had a family.

672
01:13:15,438 --> 01:13:18,202
-Shut up. Stop.
-You had a wife and a child.

673
01:13:18,407 --> 01:13:21,706
l'm so sorry it happened.
l want you to have a life.

674
01:13:21,911 --> 01:13:23,845
l have a life. We don't need--

675
01:13:24,046 --> 01:13:27,709
-Please! lt happened.
-We don't need to go into this.

676
01:13:27,917 --> 01:13:30,784
-Please--
-You like to push people, don't you?

677
01:13:30,986 --> 01:13:34,251
l just want to understand you,
to know who you are.

678
01:13:34,457 --> 01:13:39,520
l can't do that if you don't let me.
l know it's hard, l can imagine--

679
01:13:39,729 --> 01:13:41,492
You can't imagine anything!

680
01:13:41,697 --> 01:13:44,723
You have no idea how it feels
to do what l did--

681
01:13:47,236 --> 01:13:48,225
What?

682
01:13:52,842 --> 01:13:54,707
Stay with me, okay?

683
01:13:55,911 --> 01:14:00,610
lt's not your fault.
l was there, l saw the reports.

684
01:14:00,816 --> 01:14:03,910
That truck, it just-- Catch, please.

685
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:07,248
l'm trying to tell you
something, okay?

686
01:14:09,859 --> 01:14:12,293
l'm trying to tell you that....

687
01:14:12,695 --> 01:14:13,889
You're not alone.

688
01:14:15,698 --> 01:14:19,134
-l'm trying to tell you that l....
-Don't.

689
01:14:35,117 --> 01:14:39,349
-You're supposed to be his dad!
-Can't you take him?

690
01:14:39,555 --> 01:14:42,456
l'll be busy!
l won't have time today!

691
01:14:42,658 --> 01:14:44,182
And l have time?

692
01:15:28,437 --> 01:15:31,873
That's a hell of a greeting.
What's up with you?

693
01:15:32,641 --> 01:15:37,601
You don't return my calls. Haven't
shown up for work three, four days.

694
01:15:38,414 --> 01:15:40,882
You don't look like you got the flu.

695
01:15:43,352 --> 01:15:46,480
-l take it Freak Show dumped you?
-Fuck you.

696
01:15:48,891 --> 01:15:51,553
l wish l could say l'm sorry,
but l ain't.

697
01:15:51,794 --> 01:15:53,887
l think it's best for everybody.

698
01:15:54,129 --> 01:15:56,962
-Really? And who's ''everybody''?
-Me.

699
01:16:02,771 --> 01:16:06,172
Martha Stewart, you gonna pour
your partner a cup?

700
01:16:09,912 --> 01:16:11,038
He had you.

701
01:16:11,914 --> 01:16:13,347
He got you, didn't he?

702
01:16:15,718 --> 01:16:18,619
l'm gonna give you some
real strong advice.

703
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:22,985
Change the subject.

704
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:29,063
Charlene's pregnant.

705
01:16:33,535 --> 01:16:34,763
That's great.

706
01:16:36,739 --> 01:16:38,263
Congratulations.

707
01:16:40,509 --> 01:16:43,603
l'm not sure l'm ready to
be a daddy yet.

708
01:16:45,547 --> 01:16:48,015
l haven't gotten over Miss Stillwell.

709
01:16:50,686 --> 01:16:51,710
Who?

710
01:16:53,155 --> 01:16:55,248
Tenth-grade English teacher.

711
01:16:56,058 --> 01:16:58,322
Hot buttered Stillwell.

712
01:17:06,201 --> 01:17:09,102
l know you gotta go through this.

713
01:17:09,305 --> 01:17:12,468
l'll tell the boss
l stopped by to see you.

714
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:16,109
You as sick as a dog,
coughing up organs and shit.

715
01:17:16,312 --> 01:17:19,042
But l can't let this
go on much longer.

716
01:17:19,982 --> 01:17:22,473
We got us a job to do out there.

717
01:17:22,818 --> 01:17:26,447
We gotta clean these streets
before my baby gets here.

718
01:17:26,922 --> 01:17:28,890
You know what l'm saying?

719
01:17:58,220 --> 01:17:59,380
Has he been here?

720
01:17:59,955 --> 01:18:04,483
l was expecting him this
morning. He shops for me.

721
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:09,087
l give him money from the settlement
every week.

722
01:18:10,165 --> 01:18:12,395
Can't talk about that with him.

723
01:18:15,437 --> 01:18:20,033
When he comes here, do you ever
talk about the accident?

724
01:18:20,876 --> 01:18:24,004
-Does he ever mention the past?
-No.

725
01:18:24,213 --> 01:18:25,180
Why not?

726
01:18:25,714 --> 01:18:29,150
l try to let him
find his own way through.

727
01:18:30,519 --> 01:18:32,316
l feel he needs that.

728
01:18:36,325 --> 01:18:39,123
Why are you here, Sharon?

729
01:18:39,928 --> 01:18:42,226
l want to know how to help him.

730
01:18:42,464 --> 01:18:45,865
-You are helping him.
-l don't think so.

731
01:18:46,402 --> 01:18:48,370
What makes you think that?

732
01:18:50,172 --> 01:18:52,231
l took him to the cemetery--

733
01:18:52,474 --> 01:18:53,805
The cemetery?

734
01:18:54,877 --> 01:18:56,572
l thought it might help.

735
01:18:57,046 --> 01:18:58,707
He needs to face it.

736
01:19:00,949 --> 01:19:04,350
He will face it, in his time.

737
01:19:07,656 --> 01:19:12,093
He built a wall around that whole day
and that night.

738
01:19:12,327 --> 01:19:15,319
My daughter and my grandson.

739
01:19:15,564 --> 01:19:17,498
He can't help it.

740
01:19:19,968 --> 01:19:21,765
A cemetery....

741
01:19:23,338 --> 01:19:27,570
Do you know how hard it is for me
to go to the cemetery?

742
01:19:28,377 --> 01:19:32,370
l was just trying to help him
get back to some kind of life.

743
01:19:32,781 --> 01:19:34,248
He was coming back.

744
01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:38,045
Don't you realize how he's
changed these past weeks?

745
01:19:38,287 --> 01:19:42,018
His apartment, his life?
He fell in love.

746
01:19:42,257 --> 01:19:47,490
Why do you want to rush things? Why
does everybody rush things these days?

747
01:19:50,933 --> 01:19:52,195
l was scared.

748
01:19:53,402 --> 01:19:55,097
Scared of what?

749
01:19:57,406 --> 01:19:58,566
Of losing him.

750
01:20:00,075 --> 01:20:03,044
And l guess that's what l did.
l lost him.

751
01:20:04,046 --> 01:20:06,742
You were just trying to find your way.

752
01:20:07,382 --> 01:20:09,577
What else can we do?

753
01:20:10,185 --> 01:20:14,884
You think l'm always sure about what
l should or shouldn't say to him?

754
01:20:15,124 --> 01:20:17,957
l just try to do what's right...

755
01:20:18,193 --> 01:20:21,856
...and hope that he'll
find the love in it.

756
01:20:24,566 --> 01:20:26,124
Look at you...

757
01:20:26,835 --> 01:20:29,736
...so worried now, and miserable.

758
01:20:34,409 --> 01:20:36,400
There's love in that.

759
01:20:48,857 --> 01:20:49,687
''l just...

760
01:20:50,592 --> 01:20:53,254
...wanted to wish you both the best.''

761
01:20:54,062 --> 01:20:58,761
''l just want to wish you both well
and say congratulations.''

762
01:21:04,273 --> 01:21:06,764
''Hi, Mom, Dad.

763
01:21:07,276 --> 01:21:10,575
l just stopped by
to say congratulations...

764
01:21:10,779 --> 01:21:13,771
...and l think it's great.''

765
01:21:20,389 --> 01:21:21,617
These shoes, no.

766
01:21:29,932 --> 01:21:32,992
Please leave a message after the tone.

767
01:21:34,102 --> 01:21:35,091
Catch?

768
01:21:36,305 --> 01:21:37,772
Can you pick up?

769
01:21:44,546 --> 01:21:46,138
Will you call me?

770
01:21:57,926 --> 01:22:03,057
You declared your love for one
another in the presence of Christ.

771
01:22:03,265 --> 01:22:05,358
He consecrated you in baptism...

772
01:22:05,567 --> 01:22:09,970
...enriched and strengthened you
in the sacrament of matrimony...

773
01:22:10,205 --> 01:22:15,074
...so you can carry out the duties of
marriage in lasting fidelity.

774

--congratulates you
and rejoices with you...

775
01:22:36,498 --> 01:22:39,558
...on reaching this milestone
in your journey.

776
01:22:40,369 --> 01:22:42,860
Are you prepared to
give yourselves again...

777
01:22:43,071 --> 01:22:45,562
...to that union larger
than yourselves...

778
01:22:45,774 --> 01:22:49,005
...that union already
blessed by God?

779
01:22:49,211 --> 01:22:50,769
-Yes.
-Yes, we are.

780
01:22:50,979 --> 01:22:54,938
Face each other and join hands
please, and say after me:

781
01:22:55,584 --> 01:22:57,575
-l, Carl...
-l, Carl...

782
01:22:57,786 --> 01:23:00,550
-...take thee, Josephine...
-...take thee, Josephine...

783
01:23:00,789 --> 01:23:03,622
-...to be my wife.

784
01:23:04,526 --> 01:23:06,551
-l, Josephine...
-l, Josephine...

785
01:23:06,795 --> 01:23:08,729

786
01:23:08,930 --> 01:23:11,865
-...to be my husband.
-...to be my husband.

787
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:16,332
l promise to be true to you
in good times and in bad...

788
01:23:16,638 --> 01:23:18,469
...in sickness and in health.

789
01:23:18,707 --> 01:23:20,106
l promise to love you...

790
01:23:20,409 --> 01:23:24,209
...and honor you
till death do us part.

791
01:23:32,754 --> 01:23:33,743
Annie.

792
01:23:35,957 --> 01:23:36,787
Max.

793
01:23:37,926 --> 01:23:41,020
l don't want you to think
l forgot you.

794
01:23:41,930 --> 01:23:47,197
lt's just that l couldn't find you.
l woke up and you were gone.

795
01:23:47,936 --> 01:23:52,100
Everything was gone.
lt just disappeared in one minute.

796
01:23:52,341 --> 01:23:55,970
l couldn't remember that minute.
l lost it.

797
01:23:57,245 --> 01:24:02,512
But l think l found it all now.
l used a calculator, see.

798
01:24:03,251 --> 01:24:06,379
Do you know we get about
1400 minutes a day?

799
01:24:07,589 --> 01:24:10,422
So l figured it out.

800
01:24:11,159 --> 01:24:12,126
l was...

801
01:24:13,161 --> 01:24:14,355
...29 years old...

802
01:24:14,563 --> 01:24:17,361
...three months and eight days.

803
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:22,769
So it was minute number...

804
01:24:22,971 --> 01:24:27,738
...1 7,810,200 or so.

805
01:24:29,478 --> 01:24:31,309
That's the one l lost.

806
01:24:32,581 --> 01:24:35,414
When l lost that minute,
l guess l....

807
01:24:35,617 --> 01:24:37,482
l tried to lose it all...

808
01:24:38,086 --> 01:24:39,519
...all the memories...

809
01:24:39,988 --> 01:24:42,286
...because it hurt so bad.

810
01:24:44,626 --> 01:24:46,253
l tried, but....

811
01:24:53,034 --> 01:24:54,661
But l couldn't do it.

812
01:24:57,005 --> 01:24:59,667
Max, you were sick that day, remember?

813
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:01,668
lt was your birthday...

814
01:25:03,912 --> 01:25:05,675
...and you ate too much.

815
01:25:15,690 --> 01:25:17,419
Annie, you said:

816
01:25:18,026 --> 01:25:20,893
''Slow down, it's wet, okay?''

817
01:25:21,329 --> 01:25:23,092
And you were right.

818
01:25:23,665 --> 01:25:25,690
l should have slowed down.

819
01:25:27,369 --> 01:25:30,167
l should have slowed down
lots of times.

820
01:25:31,239 --> 01:25:33,366
But l didn't always listen.

821
01:25:34,476 --> 01:25:36,535
l didn't listen when you...

822
01:25:37,145 --> 01:25:42,082
...when you said, ''Steve,
just please spend more time.''

823
01:25:49,491 --> 01:25:52,358
That day l made you smile,
Max, remember?

824
01:25:52,561 --> 01:25:54,290
You looked at me...

825
01:25:55,197 --> 01:25:56,596
...and I made a face...

826
01:25:57,032 --> 01:25:59,398
...and then we all smiled.

827
01:26:00,101 --> 01:26:01,932
lt was a great minute.

828
01:26:02,137 --> 01:26:03,536
lt was.

829
01:26:06,775 --> 01:26:09,767
l'm so glad l found that minute.

830
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:13,943
And no matter what...

831
01:26:14,483 --> 01:26:17,543
...no matter what,
l won't forget anymore.

832
01:26:24,125 --> 01:26:25,615
Daddy!

833
01:26:58,159 --> 01:27:00,218
l won't forget anymore.

834
01:27:03,565 --> 01:27:04,964
l love you.

835
01:27:50,312 --> 01:27:53,338
Don't make him talk about
anything today.

836
01:27:54,716 --> 01:27:55,705
l know.

837
01:27:58,453 --> 01:28:00,284
lt was a nice ceremony.

838
01:28:02,857 --> 01:28:05,121
We're running out of chicken.

839
01:28:05,694 --> 01:28:07,719
Nobody's eating the ham.

840
01:28:11,333 --> 01:28:13,460
lt's still a great party.

841
01:28:14,836 --> 01:28:16,269
You look happy.

842
01:28:17,772 --> 01:28:20,400
30 years and still in love, huh?

843
01:28:20,875 --> 01:28:23,343
You think that's wrong, don't you?

844
01:28:24,079 --> 01:28:25,444
Of course not.

845
01:28:32,253 --> 01:28:33,447
You're beautiful.

846
01:29:15,096 --> 01:29:16,085
Dad.

847
01:29:20,268 --> 01:29:22,759
-Don't walk away, okay?
-What?

848
01:29:23,471 --> 01:29:26,099
ls it working?
Do you need to check it?

849
01:29:26,875 --> 01:29:28,240
-lt's fine.
-Dad--

850
01:29:28,443 --> 01:29:31,742
-What the hell are you doing?
-Sharon, please.

851
01:29:31,946 --> 01:29:35,279
Please, please what?
Why do you always protect him?

852
01:29:35,483 --> 01:29:37,246
''Don't bother your father.''

853
01:29:37,452 --> 01:29:41,115
l'm gonna bother you for a minute.
Can you handle that?

854
01:29:41,322 --> 01:29:45,190
-You get the hell--
-This is between me and my father.

855
01:29:45,393 --> 01:29:49,762
So both of you, just leave us alone
for one goddamn minute!

856
01:29:55,970 --> 01:29:57,767
How about you, Dad?

857
01:29:58,373 --> 01:29:59,601
You want me to go?

858
01:30:01,643 --> 01:30:04,407
-lt's up to you.
-l'm asking you.

859
01:30:05,346 --> 01:30:06,540
Am l welcome here?

860
01:30:10,118 --> 01:30:11,517
You're here, aren't you?

861
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:14,314
-What do you want?
-l want to know.

862
01:30:15,623 --> 01:30:17,454
Do you want me here?

863
01:30:21,196 --> 01:30:24,188
Do you still love me?
l want to know.

864
01:30:39,380 --> 01:30:40,745
l feel like....

865
01:30:43,418 --> 01:30:45,386
You feel like what, Dad?

866
01:30:51,426 --> 01:30:54,327
l feel like l don't
have a daughter anymore.

867
01:30:59,601 --> 01:31:00,590
Well...

868
01:31:02,370 --> 01:31:06,830
...you do. And it's a shame that
you'll miss knowing her.

869
01:31:37,205 --> 01:31:38,399
l'm next.

870
01:31:40,241 --> 01:31:44,177
Hi, Mom, Dad. Congratulations.

871
01:31:45,814 --> 01:31:49,614
You know, being in this house
reminds of something.

872
01:31:50,118 --> 01:31:52,245
l was about 10 years old.

873
01:31:53,922 --> 01:31:56,982
Me and Larry were playing
alien invasion.

874
01:31:58,259 --> 01:31:59,590
Remember, Lar?

875
01:32:00,395 --> 01:32:03,694
Anyway, we were making a lot of noise.

876
01:32:05,366 --> 01:32:09,029
Dad came home from work,
tired and pissed off.

877
01:32:09,904 --> 01:32:12,031
We were yelling like mad.

878
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:15,107
He burst into the room and he yells:

879
01:32:15,310 --> 01:32:17,175
''What the hell are you doing?''

880
01:32:17,812 --> 01:32:19,302
And l was scared.

881
01:32:20,381 --> 01:32:22,246
l was really scared.

882
01:32:23,685 --> 01:32:25,016
And l said:

883
01:32:26,855 --> 01:32:29,323
''We're playing alien invasion.''

884
01:32:30,491 --> 01:32:34,427
And he said, ''l'll show you
a damn alien invasion!''

885
01:32:36,197 --> 01:32:37,255
He picks me up.

886
01:32:37,465 --> 01:32:41,162
He picks me up off the floor
and he throws me on the couch.

887
01:32:41,369 --> 01:32:46,636
Then he grabs Larry and picks him up
and throws him on the couch.

888
01:32:47,909 --> 01:32:49,171
And then....

889
01:32:50,511 --> 01:32:53,537
Then he starts making monster noises.

890
01:32:55,450 --> 01:32:59,216
He says, ''We came to Earth
to kick ass!''

891
01:32:59,420 --> 01:33:03,447
Me and Larry, we're running
and jumping at him.

892
01:33:03,958 --> 01:33:05,789
We're laughing so hard...

893
01:33:06,127 --> 01:33:07,719
...l almost wet myself.

894
01:33:08,997 --> 01:33:14,025
And we keep running and jumping
on him, and he keeps tossing us.

895
01:33:15,403 --> 01:33:17,371
And growling and beeping.

896
01:33:24,579 --> 01:33:25,910
lt was great.

897
01:33:30,618 --> 01:33:31,983
lt was great.

898
01:33:34,756 --> 01:33:36,656
l'll never forget that.

899
01:33:44,065 --> 01:33:45,589
And l miss that.

900
01:33:48,870 --> 01:33:50,064
l miss it.

901
01:33:56,010 --> 01:33:57,739
Anyway, l just...

902
01:33:59,213 --> 01:34:02,341
...wanted to say thanks for that, Dad.

903
01:34:06,454 --> 01:34:07,682
Thanks.

904
01:34:16,898 --> 01:34:17,887
Bye.

905
01:35:25,033 --> 01:35:26,830
What are you doing here?

906
01:35:27,602 --> 01:35:29,297
You invited me.

907
01:35:30,271 --> 01:35:31,465
Are you okay?

908
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:33,571
Yeah, l'm okay.

909
01:35:36,811 --> 01:35:38,642
l wanted to apologize.

910
01:35:39,447 --> 01:35:40,607
For what?

911
01:35:44,385 --> 01:35:49,721
For wanting everything to be perfect.
You were right, l was pushing you.

912
01:35:53,494 --> 01:35:55,519
Then l realized that...

913
01:35:55,730 --> 01:35:58,198
...it doesn't have to be perfect.

914
01:35:58,966 --> 01:35:59,796
l mean....

915
01:36:01,836 --> 01:36:04,361
lt can be whatever it is.

916
01:36:10,645 --> 01:36:13,443
They don't like me very much
in there.

917
01:36:14,282 --> 01:36:16,910
They're lucky to have you in there.

918
01:36:18,286 --> 01:36:21,722
-That's a nice thing to say.
-lt's not a nice thing.

919
01:36:21,956 --> 01:36:23,423
lt's the truth.

920
01:36:26,928 --> 01:36:29,624
Why do you try so hard not to cry?

921
01:36:35,236 --> 01:36:36,931
lt's not fair.

922
01:36:38,806 --> 01:36:40,535
l did the right thing.

923
01:36:42,443 --> 01:36:43,910
l know l did.

924
01:36:45,313 --> 01:36:48,805
lt's not fair that
they're shutting me out.

925
01:36:56,390 --> 01:36:58,881
There's nothing l can do anymore.

926
01:37:04,098 --> 01:37:05,861
l went, Sharon.

927
01:37:08,169 --> 01:37:11,969
l went to see my wife
and my son today.

928
01:37:14,008 --> 01:37:17,910
l told them that l love them
and that l miss them.

929
01:37:19,147 --> 01:37:21,513
And then l told them about you.

930
01:37:26,187 --> 01:37:28,655
l told them how much l love you.

931
01:37:45,940 --> 01:37:46,964
l love you.

932
01:37:51,512 --> 01:37:53,241
l love you too.

933
01:38:36,290 --> 01:38:37,154
l'll drive.

934
01:38:38,305 --> 01:38:44,931
