1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,650
I can't accept this ring.

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,290
<i>I love you, Jung Hwa.</i>

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,250
Soo Wan.

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,840
Park Dong Joo.

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,680
Can you get out of my life?

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,670
I don't want to!Im

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,740
I can't do that.

8
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,580
You have to. You will come to do it.

9
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,950
Yoon Soo Wan!

10
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,480
<i>Episode 16</i>

11
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,040
Soo Wan.

12
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,200
You came?   What happened to you?

13
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,450
Did you see your father?

14
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,790
What about Dong Joo.

15
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,150
I heard.

16
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:51,420
About Dong Joo's mother being the donor.

17
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,840
I know how you might feel.

18
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,710
Even I am feeling shocked, and my heart burns.

19
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,350
it's a different level than just gratitude.

20
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:08,580
Park Dong Joo's mother, think of it as the gift of your life.

21
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,580
No matter how I think about it, Dong Joo's family seems to be a   ♬<i> Who are you now to decide, </i> ♬

22
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,250
gift that your mother who passed away sent you.   ♬<i> Whether or not I can be exposed to what you hide,</i> ♬

23
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,370
Min Soo,   ♬<i> Just be a strong and silent man, </i> ♬

24
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,960
I broke up with Dong Joo.   ♬<i> But every wrong turn that I make will also be,</i> ♬

25
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,690
Soo Wan, don't be like that.   ♬<i> will be my mistake,Cos we're connected through our hearts and,</i> ♬

26
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,250
I know that you're in pain and having a hard time,   ♬<i> the devastating part is that I foolishly</i> ♬

27
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,730
but you and Dong Joo love each other.  ♬<i> defended you to myself, </i> ♬

28
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,870
No, I don't have the right.   ♬<i> But secrets always have a way of coming out, </i> ♬

29
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,290
I didn't have the right to accept something like a gift from the start.

30
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,070
But Min Soo, I...   ♬<i> I'm beginning now to see, </i> ♬

31
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,670
hurt so much.  ♬<i> What you must have thought of me, </i> ♬

32
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,190
It hurts so much that I feel like I'll die.   ♬<i> In a body cast of glass, </i> ♬

33
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,760
What do I do?

34
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,580
What do I do?  ♬<i> But I don't break that easily, and if you dared</i> ♬

35
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,160
Soo Wan is asking me to disappear.

36
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,560
Soo Wan!

37
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,970
She can't look at my eyes anymore.

38
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,370
She can't look at me and smile,

39
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,320
she says that she can't hug me for my sake anymore!

40
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,720
Don't you know with what heart I came this far?

41
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,570
Feeling sorry to my mother,

42
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,040
swallowing all the hate towards you and only thinking of Soo Wan,

43
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,920
only of Soo Wan!

44
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,030
In this world she's the only person,

45
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,900
the one person who I wished to be mine,

46
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,420
is only Soo Wan.

47
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,690
Why did you do it?

48
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,650
What were you thinking when you did it?

49
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,420
I told you that she shouldn't know.

50
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,350
Not Soo Wan!

51
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,310
You should have told her that it wasn't true.

52
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,000
That it wasn't true...that it wasn't true! That it was a lie!

53
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,590
...is what you should have said.

54
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:02,900
<i>Subtitles brought to you by  The Angel Eyes Team @ Viki</i>

55
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,340
Why did you come all the way to the hospital all of the sudden?

56
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,270
Because it's an urgent matter.

57
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,140
What is it?

58
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,530
Cha Min Soo found it.   What?

59
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,930
The car that from the accident.

60
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,740
What kind of nonsense are you saying?!

61
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,080
That car was demolished right away after the accident.

62
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,520
Does it make sense that they found a car that was destroyed 12 years ago?

63
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,090
The thing is...the car was so expensive and the damage was so small that

64
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:29,560
it seems that the demolition yard's owner that wanted it secretly appropriated it and was using it for his personal use.

65
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,190
Are you fooling around right now?

66
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,810
I'm sorry.

67
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,460
That that thug night still have that car...

68
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,220
So...then what happens?

69
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:44,040
But thankfully, he fixed the car and changed it so it's unrecognizable.

70
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,540
the only thing that can be confirmed is that it is Prosecutor Kang's car that went in for demolition.

71
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,260
It cannot be used as evidence for the car accident.

72
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,610
Every time you guaranteed it like that and it's come to this.

73
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:58,430
What's more important than that is that those punks are targeting Prosecutor Kang in full scale

74
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,940
and that they will gather evidence against him.

75
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,770
Then...what do we have to do?

76
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,850
I think I'll need your help.

77
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,650
My help?

78
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,420
His response and feelings are gradually returning.

79
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,420
We have to hope for that.

80
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,200
I know why you're like that.

81
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:42,020
Park Dong Joo knows everything about his mother and about your father.

82
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,850
Ji Woon.

83
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:49,470
It's okay. You don't need to be so shocked.

84
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,310
Even if it's not to the point of understanding Father-in-law,

85
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:58,920
he's sad and pitiful.

86
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:06,020
How much did he want it, and how much must he have loved you that he must have done it.

87
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,130
I can guess.

88
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,060
Don't talk like that.

89
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,420
Ji Woon, you're a doctor too.

90
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:19,240
How many people do you think that Father-in-law has saved in his lifetime?

91
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,280
Probably several hundreds, no, several thousands.

92
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,640
Even a great doctor like Father-in-law can make that kind of mistake.

93
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,770
Because he's human, and because he's a parent.

94
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,350
I'll go inside.

95
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,100
Ji Woon,

96
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,690
Thank you, for speaking on my father's behalf that way.

97
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,470
Jin Mo.

98
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,610
Jin Mo.

99
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,810
- Jin Mo.  - Jin Mo, does it hurt a lot?

100
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,870
In school, there was a contagious disease going around.

101
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,820
They said it was going around.

102
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,530
We went to the hospital already and he's having a hard time.

103
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:38,360
He just went to bed after eating medicine.

104
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,030
What should we do?

105
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,600
You worked hard.

106
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,310
You should go now.

107
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,340
Don't go, Noona.

108
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,640
Don't go.

109
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,110
Don't worry, I won't go.

110
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,470
I'm going to be right here.

111
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,540
Dad.

112
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,110
Jin Mo, why did you come out? How are you feeling?

113
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:00,290
I feel better than yesterday.

114
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,400
-That is a relieve.   -I know.

115
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,260
Did Hae Joo leave?

116
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,150
No, she's sleeping in my room.

117
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,830
Oh, really?

118
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,520
She must've stayed up all night.

119
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,710
She should at least eat breakfast.

120
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,120
I'll go and wake her up.

121
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,610
Jin Mo.

122
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,400
Oh no!

123
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,360
Ellie! Ellie! What's wrong?

124
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,330
Wake up!

125
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,020
What happened?!

126
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,850
Hae Joo! Hae Joo!

127
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,540
Hae Joo! Hae Joo.

128
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,650
Just hold on a bit Hae Joo.

129
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:51,790
Hurry up and in. How long do you think it will take you to run all the way to the hospital?

130
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,260
Oh.

131
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:02,560
We put in a fever reducer and once the IV fluids go in she'll stabilize very quickly.

132
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,090
Was the contagious disease spread to her, too?

133
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:10,030
That's not it. She has a medical condition that can't help but make her be of a weaker constiution.

134
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:15,210
Earlier when I saw where they took her history she had leukemia with a bone marrow transplant.

135
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:19,450
It looks as though it's fully recovered but she has less immunity and has lesser stamina compared to others

136
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,040
so she has to live being careful for the rest of her life.

137
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,030
Ajusshi.

138
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,220
Hye Joo, are you okay?

139
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,420
Do you know how shocked I was?

140
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,720
I'm sorry. It's nothing much.

141
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,640
I'm like this sometimes.

142
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,730
I'll be fine soon.

143
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:55,390
But still a person who is weak in body shouldn't overdo like this.

144
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:59,020
Although this is all because of our Jin Mo,

145
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,980
aiyoo, I really...

146
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,200
I knew this time right properly what it means to have your heart sink.

147
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,910
In this situation you can laugh?

148
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:18,010
It was scarier than having mobilized to the Han River Bridge and falling.

149
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,180
Oh, this girl is laughing again.

150
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,900
My father needs a shave.

151
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,000
When did you get so many wrinkles?

152
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:56,350
You hated taking care of your health so much. It was because you wanted to go to Mom quicker, huh?

153
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,590
Because you wanted to see her.

154
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,310
The past 12 years,

155
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,930
everyday that you lived here,

156
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,200
must have been like hell for you.

157
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,670
My Dad must have had it very hard.   ♬ <i>Late at night,</i> ♬

158
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,590
I must not be too smart.  ♬ <i>Sunshines are sleep that night,</i> ♬

159
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:29,530
There are so many things that I understand now.   ♬ <i>With every star light,</i> ♬

160
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,010
When I had opened my eyes,   ♬ <i>Blowing in the air,</i> ♬

161
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,080
You didn't even look into my eyes much,

162
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,020
Bbecause you didn't smile much,   ♬ <i> Hold on, </i> ♬

163
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:50,520
I thought it was because you still hated me,  ♬ <i>Let me inside your tears,</i> ♬

164
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,860
That's what I thought.   ♬ <i>I’m gonna hold you,</i> ♬

165
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,660
I thought you were like that because you thought of Mom.   ♬ <i>Just be with me,</i> ♬

166
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,680
It's because it's so painful, right?  ♬ <i>Stay with me,</i> ♬

167
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,750
Since every time you saw my eyes it felt like you were being punished.   ♬ <i>Darkness is near by me, </i> ♬

168
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,800
Still Dad,   ♬ <i>Sometimes I’m lonely,</i> ♬

169
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,450
You shouldn't have done it.   ♬ <i>But I can see,</i> ♬

170
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,660
You shouldn't have done it.  ♬ <i>Hold me,</i> ♬

171
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,890
No matter how pitiful I was,   ♬ <i>Let me inside your dreams,</i> ♬

172
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,290
You shouldn't have done it.  ♬ <i>You gonna hold me,</i> ♬

173
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:40,310
No matter how pitiful you are Dad, or how thankful,  ♬ <i>As you loved me,</i> ♬

174
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:44,430
I can't tell you thank you.   ♬ <i>Sometimes,</i> ♬

175
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,340
But still Dad,   ♬ <i>All the time,</i> ♬

176
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,580
I'll make you less lonely now.   ♬ <i>All the time,</i> ♬

177
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,690
Let's stay together.  ♬ <i>I won’t ask,</i> ♬

178
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:14,640
Whether it's life in Hell or life in prison, not alone, but   ♬ <i>Even though trying to far away,</i> ♬

179
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,570
together with me, us two.   ♬ <i>Even though trying to far away,</i> ♬

180
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,490
Let's do it together.   ♬ <i>I know you are still there with me,</i> ♬

181
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:26,060
Instead Dad,   ♬ <i>I know you are still there with me,</i> ♬

182
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,800
I'm thinking of letting Dong Joo go.  ♬ <i>Fly away,</i> ♬

183
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,950
Let's let Dong Joo go. Let's do that.   ♬ <i>From your tears make you sad,</i> ♬

184
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,820
Let's pull him out of this Hell.   ♬ <i>When the spring winds blowing,</i> ♬

185
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,310
Except for being a good person,  ♬ <i>You wanna dance with me,</i> ♬

186
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,020
except for loving me,    ♬ <i>Go away,</i> ♬

187
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,030
our pretty Dong Joo who has no done no wrong,   ♬ <i>With a flap of the wings,</i> ♬

188
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,790
let's send him away.  ♬ <i>You are still shinning,</i> ♬

189
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,980
Dad,

190
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,460
Let's do that.   ♬ <i>All on my dreams,</i> ♬

191
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,520
Let's do that, hm?   ♬ <i>All on my dreams,</i> ♬

192
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,330
♬ <i>If I were a bluebird,</i> ♬

193
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:28,300
♬ <i>I could sing a song for you.</i> ♬

194
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:34,500
<i>Dong Joo, from now on don't ever disappear without my permission.</i>    ♬ <i>Just for you, </i> ♬

195
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,200
<i>You're going to promise, right?</i>  ♬ <i>If you're here tonight, </i> ♬

196
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,190
<i>Park Dong Joo, will you disappear from my life?<?i>   ♬ <i>I will dance with you,</i> ♬</i>

197
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:50,930
♬ <i>With the star shining above us, </i> ♬

198
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:57,530
♬ <i>Where do you go when you're lonely?</i> ♬

199
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:02,850
♬ <i>Tell me what you do when you feel so blue?</i> ♬

200
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,470
Oppa!

201
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:13,680
♬ <i>When I feel like that I think your eyes and your smile,</i> ♬

202
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:18,660
Dong Joo, Dong Joo, Dr. Park Dong Joo, why are you like this these days?  ♬ <i>And suddenly the sunshine appears close to me,</i>

203
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,150
What is it?   ♬ <i>Every time you go away I stay here,</i> ♬

204
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,120
Are you going to keep worrying your younger sister?!  ♬ <i>Every time you go away I stay here,</i> ♬

205
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,920
Hye Joo, kiddo,   ♬ <i>Even when you travel away, love is here,</i> ♬

206
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:35,870
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.  ♬ <i>Even when you travel away, love is here,</i> ♬

207
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:42,660
♬ <i>Never ever fade away from my mind.</i> ♬

208
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:52,600
♬ <i>Because your angel eyes are shining in my life,</i> ♬

209
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,970
♬ <i>Your endless splendor fills me</i> ♬

210
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:59,520
No Soo Wan... Soo Wan...

211
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:07,590
♬ <i>And delight in your eyes, once again just my heart,</i> ♬

212
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:11,540
♬ <i>As you let me look at my broken heart,</i> ♬

213
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:15,360
♬ <i>And you turned away from my every breath,</i> ♬

214
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:22,460
♬<i>Loving more to break, loving more to share.,</i> ♬

215
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,950
Did you wake up, Oppa?

216
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,410
Why are you suddenly knitting?

217
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:59,930
When we were young Mom always knit for us.

218
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:05,080
She knitted socks, knitted gloves, and even knitted sweaters.

219
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,350
She did.

220
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:12,750
When I asked if it wasn't tiring she said that there was nothing that let her show her love as much as this.

221
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,780
Love?

222
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:18,190
While knitting thread by thread you think of that person.

223
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:21,870
Even if your attention wanders for a moment, as if repenting for a wayward heart,

224
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:27,170
unraveling it from the place it went wrong and restarting from that place.

225
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,660
You even remember those kinds of words?

226
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,100
And since it's the only one in the whole world.

227
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,050
It's a present that can't fit as well or look as good on anyone else.

228
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:40,010
That it was the same heart as loving someone.

229
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,680
So who are you knitting it to give to?

230
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:52,020
Secret.

231
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,150
With Sunbae and the Director, I have a lot of reasons to come to the hospital these days.

232
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,280
It's kind of nice to see you like this.

233
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,800
But didn't you say that you had something to ask me?

234
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:20,150
Well...it's a little awkward to ask you this type of thing...don't misunderstand, but

235
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,680
since I know your character,

236
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,980
I'm telling you because I don't think that it's proper to hide things between us...

237
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:31,380
Why are you having such trouble, so unlike yourself? What is it?

238
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,770
While investigating a case, 12 years ago Prosecutor Kang

239
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:38,960
bought a sportscar and then had it destroyed.

240
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,830
What about that car?

241
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:44,200
By chance, do you have anything that you remember regarding that car?

242
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,900
Ye..yes.

243
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,850
But why are you investigating that car?

244
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:55,920
Before I had told you that I was reinvestigating Park Dong Joo's mother's accident.

245
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,610
Because of that while I was looking into it,

246
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:04,100
Just in case you had heard something from your father around that time, or something like that...

247
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,600
No, this is really not something I should be asking you, Dr. Kang.

248
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:14,120
Me letting you know this...

249
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,600
In a little while a request can go to your father to subpoena him.

250
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,130
Just know that I'm notifying you ahead like this because of our relationship.

251
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,340
Detective Cha.  Yes.

252
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,990
That accident. Where did it occur?

253
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:31,150
The location of the accident?

254
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,790
This is all the records for the past patients who were in the hospital in January and February of 2001.

255
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,110
But what do you need all this for?

256
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,680
I can just look at them for a moment, can't I?

257
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,920
Of course.

258
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,440
Kim Hye Sook...

259
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,550
Kim Hye Sook.

260
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:22,610
<i> On February 28th in 2002 around 5 am, she was hit by a car while riding a bicycle and twisted her ankle. </i>

261
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:56,570
<i>While knitting thread by thread you think of that person.</i>

262
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:00,450
<i>Even if your attention wanders for a moment, as if repenting for a wayward heart, </i>

263
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:05,250
<i>You have to unravel it from the place it went wrong and restart from that place.</i>

264
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,740
<i>And since it's the only one in the whole world.</i>

265
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:12,950
<i> And because it's a present that can't fit as well or look as good on someone else.</i>

266
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,330
Oh! Oppa, you were here!

267
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,480
But is Unni okay?

268
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,710
It's not that she can't even eat properly for nursing the Director?

269
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:30,170
Should I make the pumpkin porridge that Unnie (Soo Wan) likes so much?

270
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:36,610
Can I still not go to see Unnie (Soo Wan)?

271
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,910
Hye Joo.

272
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:49,510
There's something that Oppa has to tell you.

273
00:26:52,970 --> 00:27:01,030
<i>Subtitles brought to you by  The Angel Eyes Team @ Viki</i>

274
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,880
Don't be like this.

275
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,730
It's like this for even me,

276
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:24,830
how bad must it have been for Oppa (Dong Joo).

277
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,100
I understand now.

278
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,150
Of course Oppa said that it was okay, right?

279
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm okay too.

280
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,130
In fact, I'm actually happy.

281
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:39,020
That Mom made you open your eyes,

282
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,940
I like it. I like it so much.

283
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,490
Hye Joo,

284
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,280
Why don't you like it?

285
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,110
Why is that something to be heartsick about?

286
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,870
Why is it something to break up about?

287
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,530
I'm so happy about it.

288
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,850
So that I can think of Mom even like this.

289
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,270
Not because it's someone else but because it's you.

290
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,950
As expected our Mom is really smart.

291
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:21,460
Extremely.

292
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,540
I'm so extremely proud.

293
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:31,480
Unnie, why don't you feel that way?

294
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,490
Hye Joo, I'm sorry.

295
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,920
I'm so sorry.

296
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,900
Don't be sorry.

297
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,290
You only need to be thankful.

298
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:48,050
It's fine if you're good to me and Oppa.

299
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:51,610
We're going to be happy together.

300
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,550
I thought about it a lot,

301
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:01,350
but Unnie and Oppa don't seem to be helpful to each other.

302
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,870
Your brother has his future ahead of him.

303
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:11,210
And I have my work and my life.

304
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:14,070
I can't give up my father also.

305
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:17,140
Those are all excuses.

306
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,840
You can solve it with love.

307
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,000
You can each concede things and work together.

308
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,270
If you're going to live together forever,

309
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:32,050
there's something that isn't easy with just love.

310
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:35,400
That's why everyone says weddings are hard.

311
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,070
Are you sincere?

312
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:44,390
If that's so, then I'm disappointed.

313
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,930
I don't even know how to hate you.

314
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:55,000
Hate me.

315
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,990
You can hate me.

316
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:19,220
Oh, right. I have something to give you.

317
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:45,650
You know this, right? It's Dong Joo's fathers.

318
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,100
Unni.

319
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:51,830
You were supposed to have it in the first place but I returned too late.

320
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,360
Unni.

321
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:58,540
Go back safely.

322
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,810
Yoon Soo Wan,

323
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:54,260
What is this?

324
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,910
Why did you give this to Hae Joo? It's yours.

325
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,420
It's not mine nor Hae Joo's, but it's yours.

326
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,350
Stop being stubborn.

327
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,220
I told you I can't do it.

328
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,140
If I was going to give up like this I wouldn't have even held it in.

329
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,900
Don't hold it in. You can just give up.

330
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,380
Can you live without seeing me?

331
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,880
-Can you breathe without me?  -Park Dong Joo.

332
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,180
It's really touching,

333
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:24,080
but we're at the age to know that we won't die after breaking up.

334
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,890
I told you.

335
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:29,660
I know because I went through it. I felt like I was going to die.

336
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,950
It'll be worse as much to the point of thinking that dying is better.

337
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:36,500
This is obsession. If you continue this, it will seem like you want me close to revenge on me,

338
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,470
like you want to hate me as we live.

339
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,930
I might think that childishly. Is that what you want?

340
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,020
- Yoon Soo Wan!  - Leave.

341
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,220
Please leave.

342
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:56,060
Are you being sincere?

343
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,490
How many times do I have to tell you to believe me?

344
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:09,940
Should I tell you a hundred and thousand times?

345
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:16,940
I feel like I'm going to die when I see you,

346
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:23,300
so please leave.

<i>As I kept finding evidence for the accident, I found out that twelve years ago, Prosecutor Kang In Tae</i>

362

<i>She got discharged with no problem.</i>

363
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:16,960
<i>I saw with my own eyes</i>

364
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,640
<i>that she came in with not that serious of a injury.</i>

365
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,640
Yes, Mrs. Kim Hye Sook. I'm Jang Ji Hoon, the person who called you before.

366
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,300
I think I'm nearby here.

367
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:38,800
Oh, here!

368
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,820
Hi, Dr. Lee.

369
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,650
<i>Which room is the patient who was taken in after a car accident this morning located?<i></i></i>

370
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:55,730
<i>Oh, the one who got into a accident after riding her bike?</i>

371
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:58,540
-<i>Yes.  -Please wait a moment.</i>

372
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:01,970
<i>It's room 314. Is it someone you know?</i>

373
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,060
<i>Yes. Please take care of her.</i>

374
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:07,160
<i>Okay, we'll take extra care of her.</i>

375
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,700
<i>Hello. </i>

376
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,540
<i>How are you?</i>

377
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:39,260
<i> I am feeling well. </i>

378
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:42,740
<i>You seem better.</i>

379
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,200
<i> Kim Hye Sook   Female/40</i>

380
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:52,480
<i> Name: Kim Hye Sook <i></i></i>

381
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,730
She took care of me.

382
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:18,850
Ever since then, whenever someone needs to go to the hospital in this neighborhood

383
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:22,240
I tell them to go to Seyoung Hospital.

384
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:27,580
On that day you got into a car accident and got transferred.

385
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,210
It was a hit and run, right?

386
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:31,470
Hit and run?

387
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:36,700
Can I call that a hit and run?

388
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,980
It was at dawn,

389
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,000
and back then, the four way street near a post office.

390
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,220
was a levee.

391
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:49,650
Wait a minute. The place where the accident took place was next to a post office?

392
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,870
Yes.

393
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:54,860
I was a little unstable because it was my first time riding a bicycle.

394
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,720
So when a car passed me,

395
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,380
I was so scared and just fell by myself.

396
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:06,910
Then, you're saying the car and the bike never hit?

397
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,850
That's what I'm saying.

398
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:12,080
But, because my leg got fractured.

399
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:16,000
I don't know how she found out. But, that director,

400
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,720
the female doctor I told you about just now,

401
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,270
said that she was the one who was in a rush

402
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:27,600
and said she was sorry. She payed for all the payment

403
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:32,060
and even gave compensation and let me get discharged.

404
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:38,420
It was then that I felt that these doctors have kind hearts.

405
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:07,570
<i>Your mother's accident was a hit and run 12 years ago?</i>

406
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:11,680
<i>Yes, she was riding her bike at dawn.</i>

407
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:19,410
<i>Where did that accident take place?</i>

408
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,600
<i>No.</i>

409
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,670
It can't be.

410
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,860
What is it?

411
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:17,810
Are you hurt somewhere?

412
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,810
What happened to your face?

413
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,620
Mom.

414
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:25,050
Yeah.

415
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:28,980
The car that father bought me.

416
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:33,410
They said they are re-investigating the

417
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:36,140
car for hit and run.

418
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,750
What are you saying? Who said that?

419
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:44,530
Because of that accident someone died.

420
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,880
-Ji Woon.   -But, Mom.

421
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,100
The one who drove that car...

422
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,100
was me.

423
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,900
Stop it. What did you hear that you're acting like this?

424
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:05,980
But, no matter how many times I think about, it there's something that I can't understand.

425
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:12,000
I drove the car that day,

426
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,640
and hit a person.

427
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:19,190
I ran away,

428
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:26,220
but I didn't kill the person.

429
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:30,310
Yeah, did someone say you killed her?

430
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:33,910
Nobody said that you did that.

431
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:38,210
It's not you. It's a case that has nothing to do with you.

432
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:43,760
You already knew.

433
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,740
Kang Ji Woon, I told you it's not you.

434
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,610
You saw yourself.

435
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:52,880
The patient who was smiling as if nothing happened.

436
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,670
I showed her to you.

437
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:57,610
That's why.

438
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,250
Mom.

439
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:05,170
What was it that I saw that day?

440
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,650
Director Lee, what happened?

441
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,700
Ji Woon.

442
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:18,680
Doctor Oh Young Ji, what exactly did you do to me?

443
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:45,700
Soo Wan.

444
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,340
It's okay I'll clean it up.

445
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:56,800
Soo Wan!

446
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:03,040
You're bleeding.

447
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,930
Let go.

448
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:09,990
Why are you here again? I told you I don't want to see you.

449
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:12,860
I told you to disappear. I told you to back off.

450
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:16,550
Soo Wan.

451
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,850
I want to go back.

452
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:27,150
To the day before I met you.

453
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:30,220
Those times were better.

454
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,450
It was better when I couldn't see.

455
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:36,910
It was less painful then.

456
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:42,370
It was better then. It was better then!

457
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:54,060
All right, stop it now.

458
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,300
I understand, Soo Wan.

459
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:01,800
So stop having a hard time.

460
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:08,370
I'll stop making it hard for you.

461

It's Soo Wan's. Please give it to her for me.

This is also Soo Wan's.

Soo Wan is having a hard time.

495

So, what's going to happen to you two?

496
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:03,730
I'm going to leave. I have to.

497

I keep burdening you, and there is no way to pay you back.

I guess I committed a lot of sins against you in the past.

But, I'm still going to investigate your mother's case.

I'm also worried about Detective Kim's health.

Please take care of Soo Wan.

00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:31,360
What's wrong with you again? Hey.

508
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:34,490
Did you get fired?

509
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:37,740
You look as if the whole Earth has come down.

510
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:45,400
Just show some frustration it's not like you what's wrong?

511
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:49,070
I got a request from someone but I don't like it.

512
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:50,240
What?

513
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,480
Sunbae.

514
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,980
Why is a love between a man and a woman so complicated?

515
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,370
Are you dating?

516
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:05,520
Oh, no. Because I cracked my head, I'm talking nonsense.

517
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,920
There's no way, right?

518
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:10,240
Don't you just need to be with each other if you love each other?

519
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,400
You can just break up if you don't like it.

520
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,540
What's the request that you got?

521
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:21,560
You didn't break up with your wife because you hated each other.

522
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,350
Why is the subject heading towards there?

523
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:27,070
She still had the mind to continue.

524
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:31,170
But you told her to stop and treated her bad.

525
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:33,370
Why do you guys do that?

526
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:40,270
If you really like them that can happen.

527
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:44,440
Although breaking up because you love someone seems to be from a cheesy song in the '88,

528
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:47,430
But, inside there there's sincerity.

529
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:54,730
Never mind. Would you know anything? Let's stop.

530
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:58,050
I don't even want to know anything that complicated.

531
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:01,230
But, why am I in the middle of that.

532
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:05,430
Seriously. Just leave, just leave.

533
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:07,930
Leave. Get out.

534
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:10,160
Alright.

535
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,220
The result won't change if I sent it to the wrong person, right?

536
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:15,630
Go. Go.

537
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:18,900
I'm going.

538
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:25,440
That rascal...

539
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:30,310
Anyways, I wonder how my wife's business is doing,

540
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:32,750

You shouldn't have looked after me so well.

I can't even hate you.

573
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:02,130
Why did you do that? I wouldn't be able to hold a grudge against you.

574
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:09,920

But I still need to leave her.
