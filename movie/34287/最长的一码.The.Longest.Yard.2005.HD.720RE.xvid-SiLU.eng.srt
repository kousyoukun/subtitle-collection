00:01:32,828 --> 00:01:34,021
Hey, sexy.

3
00:01:34,262 --> 00:01:35,660
I love that dress.

4
00:01:35,897 --> 00:01:38,831
Of course you do, Lorenzo.
You made it.

5
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:41,566
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey, guys.

6
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:45,338
- There you are.
- Lena.

7
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,271
- You've done it again.
- Well, it's all for you, Bradlee.

8
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:49,806
Gotta mingle.

9
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:51,738
Oh, the girls are by the pool.

10
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:56,644
Well, well, well, Lena. So where's
this sexy boy toy of yours hiding?

11
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:58,647
I didn't know you were
a football fan, Patrick.

12
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:02,515
I've never watched a game. I'm just
a big fan of his old underwear ads.

13
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:06,587
Well, he's probably just getting out of
the shower. Let me go hurry his ass up.

14
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:07,987
- Hi.
- Hey, babe.

15
00:02:10,532 --> 00:02:14,467
Start of the fourth quarter, and Owens
will throw. He's got Brown wide open!

16
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,862
You have got to be kidding me.

17
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,095
Honey, just let me finish the game,
I'll take you to the movies.

18
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,168
Take me to the movies?

19
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:25,707
Hello! There's a huge party
going on downstairs.

20
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:28,142
Remember the catering trucks
and the valet parkers?

21
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,315
Oh, shit, I forgot.

22
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,418
I'll tell you what
you should forget about.

23
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,111
Football.

24
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,620
Because it's forgotten all about you.

25
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,426
Now, you're going to put this outfit on
that I bought you,

26
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:45,392
drag your drunken ass downstairs

27
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,762
and mingle with my clients
like a good boy.

28
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,827
Who am l? Elton John?
I ain't wearing that shit.

29
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,235
- Yes, you are.
- I'm not your trained monkey, honey.

30
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:59,569
No. You're much more
expensive than that.

31
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,375
But I tell you what.

32
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:04,310
If you're not downstairs
in five minutes,

33
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,507
I'm gonna throw you out of my bed,

34
00:03:06,752 --> 00:03:09,811
out of my house and out of my life.

35
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:12,819
Then you're gonna have to
pay for your own bananas.

36
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:17,286
I'm just so mad at you
because you're not wearing my gift.

37
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,159
Gift?

38
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:21,699
What gift?

39
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:25,768
It's like a l-love-you gift.
I left it in the closet for you.

40
00:03:26,505 --> 00:03:27,698
Really?

41
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:29,769
Paul, I'm so excited.

42
00:03:29,975 --> 00:03:31,601
I can't believe you did this.

43
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,642
- Where'd you put it?
- In the back, on the right.

44
00:03:35,747 --> 00:03:37,441
Paul? Paul, what are you doing?

45
00:03:37,649 --> 00:03:39,775
I think we need some
alone time, honey,

46
00:03:39,985 --> 00:03:42,817
so I'm gonna go take a cruise
in your Bentley.

47
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:46,285
Don't you dare take my car,
you drunken bastard!

48
00:03:46,491 --> 00:03:49,482
- I own you!
- I love you.

49
00:04:10,981 --> 00:04:13,676
Somebody please open
this damn door! Patrick?

50
00:04:13,884 --> 00:04:16,215
- Lena?
- Patrick.

51
00:04:17,187 --> 00:04:18,517
What happened to you?

52
00:04:18,722 --> 00:04:21,622
He locked me in the closet
and left me to die.

53
00:04:21,825 --> 00:04:24,122
Oh, my God, he is deranged!

54
00:04:24,328 --> 00:04:26,659
He thinks he can mess with me.

55
00:04:26,864 --> 00:04:27,830
91 1.

56
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:35,627
Oh, man.
Here come the party poopers.

57
00:04:44,148 --> 00:04:47,776
Well, well, well. I'll be damned.
If it isn't Paul Crewe.

58
00:04:47,984 --> 00:04:50,679
So, what did I do wrong?
Was I driving poorly?

59
00:04:51,054 --> 00:04:53,351
Nope. Nope.
This car was reported stolen.

60
00:04:53,556 --> 00:04:56,991
No, no, no.
It's actually my girlfriend's car.

61
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,683
Shit happens.

62
00:04:59,095 --> 00:05:02,154
Shit does happen. I mean,
look what happened to your ears.

63
00:05:04,534 --> 00:05:07,366
I gotta ask you something.
Does he get XM Radio with those?

64
00:05:08,071 --> 00:05:10,766
Actually, they get
a couple of channels.

65
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:14,368
It's Paul Crewe.

66
00:05:14,577 --> 00:05:15,873
Another question, though.

67
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,012
Santa Claus. What's he like?

68
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:22,208
Boy, I hate to arrest a public figure
like yourself,

69
00:05:22,418 --> 00:05:24,385
but, hell, I don't think
you got too many

70
00:05:24,587 --> 00:05:26,952
endorsement deals to worry about,
now, do you?

71
00:05:27,155 --> 00:05:29,884
Now, listen here, Mr. Frodo.
Don't get short with me.

72
00:05:32,894 --> 00:05:35,123
That was good. I mean, he's good.

73
00:05:36,231 --> 00:05:38,960
Man. I hope you got a lot of money
for that game you threw,

74
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:41,430
because that was the most pathetic
thing I ever saw.

75
00:05:42,404 --> 00:05:43,768
Now, step out of the vehicle,
Mr. Crewe.

76
00:05:43,972 --> 00:05:47,668
Don't you think I should pull the car
over more? I could get sideswiped.

77
00:05:47,876 --> 00:05:50,844
You're slurring your words a bit there,
Paul. You been drinking tonight?

78
00:05:51,046 --> 00:05:55,448
Absolutely not. Now, could you do me a
favor? Hold this beer while I back it up.

79
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:05,187
Hey, you can finish that one.
I got five more. Take care, guys.

80
00:06:06,927 --> 00:06:09,019
We got a 3-94 in progress.

81
00:06:27,882 --> 00:06:29,644
Okay, remain calm.

82
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,910
How you doing? What's up?
What's up? What's up?

83
00:06:37,558 --> 00:06:41,288
What you are watching is live footage
of a vehicle, apparently stolen,

84
00:06:41,495 --> 00:06:42,984
being pursued by police.

85
00:06:43,196 --> 00:06:46,096
We're receiving word now
that the driver of that vehicle

86
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:49,199
is former Pittsburgh football star
Paul Crewe.

87
00:06:49,402 --> 00:06:50,959
Crewe, you might remember,

88
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:54,697
was the only man ever to be indicted
on federal racketeering charges

89
00:06:54,908 --> 00:06:57,341
for shaving points
in a professional football game,

90
00:06:57,544 --> 00:06:59,170
although it was never fully proven.

91
00:07:01,981 --> 00:07:03,743
Yeah!

92
00:07:09,556 --> 00:07:11,785
- Hello.
- Do not get one more scratch

93
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:14,515
on my car, or I will slit your throat.

94
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:18,791
See, that's our problem, sweetie.

95
00:07:18,998 --> 00:07:21,591
You care about this car
more than you do us.

96
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,495
And how'd you even know
there was a scratch on this baby?

97
00:07:24,703 --> 00:07:28,695
Because I am watching you on TV,
as is the whole country.

98
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,669
Once again,
you are proving to everyone

99
00:07:30,876 --> 00:07:33,366
what a worthless piece of shit
you are.

100
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,707
Well, I hope they like this.

101
00:07:58,637 --> 00:08:00,126
Hey, Lena!

102
00:08:00,338 --> 00:08:03,898
I think we should start
seeing other people!

103
00:08:06,677 --> 00:08:08,701
I think I'm in love.

104
00:08:10,915 --> 00:08:13,781
Good news, boys,
I didn't spill my beer.

105
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:18,054
Without question, Crewe's five-year
federal probation for point-shaving

106
00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:20,223
has been severely violated tonight.

107
00:08:20,424 --> 00:08:23,881
The future of this once-great football
star looks very dark indeed.

108
00:08:46,783 --> 00:08:50,274
Long way from the big city,
huh, superstar?

109
00:08:52,622 --> 00:08:55,249
Staying with the times
around here, huh?

110
00:09:00,964 --> 00:09:03,261
Ain't she beautiful?

111
00:09:21,717 --> 00:09:23,547
Home sweet home, boy.

112
00:09:23,752 --> 00:09:25,048
Get on your feet.

113
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:31,283
You're one lucky son of a bitch,
Crewe.

114
00:09:31,493 --> 00:09:33,517
- Is that right?
- That's right.

115
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:36,026
See, the warden loves his football.

116
00:09:36,231 --> 00:09:39,290
Fact, he was on the winning side
of your little thing.

117
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:42,469
- Well, tell him congratulations.
- But I wasn't.

118
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,436
Welcome to Allenville.

119
00:09:46,842 --> 00:09:49,639
Thank you, sergeant.
I'll take it from here.

120
00:09:52,615 --> 00:09:55,014
- Afternoon, inmate Crewe.
- Yeah.

121
00:09:55,217 --> 00:09:57,241
Come on. Warden wants to see you.

122
00:09:57,885 --> 00:09:58,908
Let's do it.

123
00:09:59,387 --> 00:10:00,410
Move it.

124
00:10:23,711 --> 00:10:25,575
I used to play
a little college ball myself.

125
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,747
Down at the University of Miami.

126
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:30,348
I bet a lot of your old teammates
are locked up in here.

127
00:10:30,551 --> 00:10:33,986
No inmates from my playing days.
Couple of guards, though.

128
00:10:34,187 --> 00:10:36,984
See, we got us a fine
prison-guard league down here.

129
00:10:38,225 --> 00:10:40,920
It's like a company softball team.

130
00:10:41,728 --> 00:10:43,354
Now, the warden...

131
00:10:44,531 --> 00:10:46,327
...he's gonna ask you to help out.

132
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:48,124
Okay. With what?

133
00:10:54,608 --> 00:10:56,131
That wasn't nice.

134
00:10:58,912 --> 00:11:00,879
When the warden asks you,

135
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:02,342
what are you gonna say?

136
00:11:03,517 --> 00:11:05,143
Yes?

137
00:11:13,859 --> 00:11:16,691
You're gonna tell him "no."
You got it?

138
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:18,552
You're gonna tell the warden

139
00:11:18,764 --> 00:11:22,062
that you want nothing to do
with his football fantasies.

140
00:11:23,102 --> 00:11:25,069
Not in my back yard.

141
00:11:26,505 --> 00:11:30,497
Because the warden
don't run this prison. I do.

142
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,835
You understand?

143
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:33,744
Not entirely.

144
00:11:38,117 --> 00:11:42,382
Okay. I feel you, dog. I feel you.

145
00:11:44,623 --> 00:11:47,250
Paul "Wrecking" Crewe.

146
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,427
I don't get to say this
to my new guests very often,

147
00:11:49,628 --> 00:11:52,118
but it's an honor to have you
here at this institution.

148
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,627
It's an honor to be
locked up here, sir.

149
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:58,566
Oh, well, this is Errol Dandridge.

150
00:12:00,171 --> 00:12:02,365
Colonel Sanders
been eating his own chicken.

151
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:05,207
He's my political adviser.

152
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,310
See, I've been approached
by several very influential people

153
00:12:08,513 --> 00:12:11,811
wondering if I'd be interested
in standing for governor.

154
00:12:12,016 --> 00:12:16,543
They see the way I run this prison,
think maybe I should run this state.

155
00:12:16,921 --> 00:12:19,388
Only with less sodomy, right?

156
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:26,288
Hopefully none.

157
00:12:27,098 --> 00:12:28,064
Sorry.

158
00:12:30,134 --> 00:12:33,728
Now, there are two things we take very
seriously here in the state of Texas.

159
00:12:34,204 --> 00:12:37,036
Prison and football.

160
00:12:37,274 --> 00:12:39,138
We play a little of the latter here.

161
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:43,676
The warden is too modest to admit
that his team is rather good.

162
00:12:43,981 --> 00:12:45,470
But not good enough.

163
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:49,049
Five years since
our last championship.

164
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,781
Five years.

165
00:12:50,988 --> 00:12:54,047
Now, I've worked real hard,
pulled strings,

166
00:12:54,258 --> 00:12:56,623
called in quite a few favors
to get you here, Paul.

167
00:12:57,961 --> 00:12:59,723
Now, why would you go and do that?

168
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,365
Because I am convinced that
you can get us back on track.

169
00:13:05,936 --> 00:13:10,099
I haven't played football in I don't
know how long. I don't really want to.

170
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:13,672
You wouldn't be playing, Paul.
Just consulting.

171
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,469
Anyone who was once the MVP
of the National Football League

172
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:19,272
must have a great deal
of expertise to offer.

173
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:23,239
Captain, what would you say
to Mr. Crewe looking in,

174
00:13:23,452 --> 00:13:25,919
giving us the benefit
of his experience?

175
00:13:26,122 --> 00:13:30,387
I think that's a real good idea, warden.
We can use all the help we can get.

176
00:13:31,194 --> 00:13:33,423
Well, then, it's all settled.

177
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:34,987
What you say, Paul?

178
00:13:35,998 --> 00:13:39,296
I appreciate the offer,
but I'm gonna have to pass.

179
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,229
Now, I can assure you

180
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:50,537
that your time here will be a whole
lot easier if you just participate.

181
00:13:52,514 --> 00:13:56,142
I just wanna do my time
and go home. Nothing else.

182
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,885
If you'll excuse us, Mr. Crewe.

183
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,550
Captain Knauer, you can stay.

184
00:14:08,997 --> 00:14:10,429
Sit down!

185
00:14:13,034 --> 00:14:16,992
I used to love
your underwear commercials.

186
00:14:17,973 --> 00:14:19,269
Thank you very much.

187
00:14:19,474 --> 00:14:23,671
My ex-husband wore the
same brand of tighty whities.

188
00:14:25,046 --> 00:14:28,845
He didn't fill them out
quite as well as you, though.

189
00:14:29,383 --> 00:14:32,840
Special effects. Hollywood.
Not all me.

190
00:14:33,053 --> 00:14:36,180
Oh, I doubt that very seriously.

191
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,358
Well, then get him enthusiastic,
damn it!

192
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,456
Come on, get up.

193
00:14:41,662 --> 00:14:43,686
How'd it go in there?
We all set now?

194
00:14:43,898 --> 00:14:45,762
Oh, yeah, we're real tight.

195
00:14:58,512 --> 00:15:01,639
Only the finest for you, superstar.

196
00:15:06,552 --> 00:15:08,041
I was just playing.

197
00:15:14,093 --> 00:15:15,423
I ain't gonna forget you, Crewe.

198
00:15:15,628 --> 00:15:17,720
Hey, yo, you owe me money
on that game, punk!

199
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:19,591
Better watch yourself, Mr. Football!

200
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:20,992
Bitch!

201
00:15:27,607 --> 00:15:29,574
Yeah, you better run, woman.

202
00:15:32,612 --> 00:15:33,976
Yo, football.

203
00:15:34,781 --> 00:15:36,111
Take a seat.

204
00:15:36,683 --> 00:15:38,172
Thanks.

205
00:15:38,384 --> 00:15:41,216
You know, I have never seen
one inmate just walk in here

206
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:44,514
and be unanimously hated
by the entire population.

207
00:15:44,723 --> 00:15:47,054
- I ain't never seen it.
- How'd I get so lucky?

208
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:49,123
You could have robbed banks,
sold crack,

209
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:51,852
stole your grandmama's pension,
and nobody would have cared.

210
00:15:52,064 --> 00:15:55,555
But shaving points off a football game?
Man, that's just un-American.

211
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:57,961
- You play football?
- Me? No.

212
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:01,195
I suck so bad, they used to pick me
after the white kids.

213
00:16:01,406 --> 00:16:05,136
Used to be mad too. It's like, "l can't
believe I picked a nigga that can't play."

214
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:08,335
- Caretaker.
- Paul Crewe.

215
00:16:08,547 --> 00:16:11,014
Whatever your pleasure,
I can facilitate.

216
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:14,343
You need weed, you need meth--
Hey, you need Prozac, I'm your man.

217
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:16,782
I know how you white boys
always deal with that depression.

218
00:16:16,989 --> 00:16:19,252
I mean, me personally, I don't
understand what you white boys

219
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,482
all depressed about.
Hey, you're white. Smile.

220
00:16:22,593 --> 00:16:25,959
And for a small fee,
I can even get you McDonald's.

221
00:16:26,163 --> 00:16:27,789
- Really?
- Yeah, that's right. Mickey D's.

222
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:29,727
My man Cheeseburger Eddy
got the hookup.

223
00:16:29,934 --> 00:16:30,900
Cheeseburger Eddy?

224
00:16:31,102 --> 00:16:32,932
That's right.
We can get our McFlurry on.

225
00:16:33,137 --> 00:16:34,831
Enjoy it, fat man.

226
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:37,165
What about the love
of a beautiful woman?

227
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,865
Well, you're gonna have
to lower your standards

228
00:16:40,077 --> 00:16:42,044
on the beautiful part
and on the woman part.

229
00:16:42,246 --> 00:16:44,110
Hey.

230
00:16:44,515 --> 00:16:46,311
Let's just stick
with the cheeseburgers.

231
00:16:46,517 --> 00:16:49,713
Oh, they ugly now, but in eight months,
he gonna look like Beyoncé.

232
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,886
No, thanks.

233
00:16:51,088 --> 00:16:53,021
Now, here's the most important part.

234
00:16:53,224 --> 00:16:55,589
You can't let these guys scare you.
You can't let them punk you.

235
00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:58,522
Because if you do that, you gonna
end up being somebody's bitch.

236
00:16:58,996 --> 00:17:01,520
Don't want that.
Thanks for the advice.

237
00:17:07,871 --> 00:17:10,065
Hey. Let me take that tray
out for you.

238
00:17:10,573 --> 00:17:11,834
I ain't done eating yet.

239
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:13,838
Oh, you're not?
I'll give it back to you, then.

240
00:17:14,978 --> 00:17:16,535
You're dead!

241
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:27,382
Hornet's Nest!

242
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:41,363
Everybody stay down.

243
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,934
Stay quiet!

244
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,337
Come on, Crewe, get up.

245
00:17:49,878 --> 00:17:51,310
Get up, superstar.

246
00:17:52,347 --> 00:17:53,313
Yes, sir.

247
00:17:53,515 --> 00:17:56,642
You think you can do anything
you want around here, don't you?

248
00:17:56,852 --> 00:17:59,411
Well, you are no different
than any other piece of shit

249
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,349
that calls this place home.

250
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:05,484
Really? These guys think
you're a dumb redneck too?

251
00:18:06,862 --> 00:18:08,692
Girl, that's your new boo.

252
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:17,997
You better cut that shit out.
It's getting old.

253
00:18:19,006 --> 00:18:20,529
That's gonna cost you.

254
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,205
Looking forward to it.

255
00:19:16,096 --> 00:19:18,222
Wake up, Sleeping Beauty.

256
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:22,061
Hey, superdick.

257
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:27,164
Warden's wondering if your stay
in the hotbox has changed your mind.

258
00:19:28,108 --> 00:19:29,335
How long have I been in here?

259
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,010
One week. Wanna go for two?

260
00:19:40,152 --> 00:19:41,778
How'd you find these guys anyways?

261
00:19:41,987 --> 00:19:43,112
Recruitment, boy.

262
00:19:43,322 --> 00:19:46,654
When college stars don't get drafted,
they need a place to go.

263
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:49,918
A job, money, security.

264
00:19:50,129 --> 00:19:52,824
Who drank all the damn Gatorade?!

265
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:54,791
Damn it!

266
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,591
And apparently steroids.

267
00:19:57,236 --> 00:20:00,534
Look, seems like you got all the talent
you'd want. So why do you need me?

268
00:20:00,739 --> 00:20:02,603
Well, now, you might
find this hard to believe,

269
00:20:02,808 --> 00:20:05,640
but there's folks here in the prison
league don't care for me very much.

270
00:20:05,844 --> 00:20:08,937
- You, warden?
- They thought it might be amusing

271
00:20:09,148 --> 00:20:11,775
to schedule the defending
league champs as our first game.

272
00:20:11,984 --> 00:20:14,645
And me? Well, I thought
an old pro like yourself

273
00:20:14,852 --> 00:20:18,719
might have some training-camp tricks,
drills, insights to offer up.

274
00:20:18,923 --> 00:20:20,617
Give us the competitive edge.

275
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:24,887
All right. Relatively simple.
You need a tune-up game.

276
00:20:25,096 --> 00:20:26,062
A tune-up game?

277
00:20:26,264 --> 00:20:28,891
Yeah. In college, we'd start every
season against Appalachian State

278
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,691
or some slack Division ll team.

279
00:20:30,902 --> 00:20:34,132
Kick the living shit out of them.
Get their confidence up.

280
00:20:35,673 --> 00:20:37,264
You know something, Paul?

281
00:20:37,475 --> 00:20:39,806
- You've just given me an inspiration.
- That's great. What?

282
00:20:40,011 --> 00:20:42,979
You're gonna assemble a team
to play the first game against us.

283
00:20:43,181 --> 00:20:46,513
And you, Mr. Crewe,
are gonna be the quarterback.

284
00:20:46,985 --> 00:20:48,008
I don't think so.

285
00:20:48,219 --> 00:20:49,549
Let me tell you something.

286
00:20:49,754 --> 00:20:52,745
In my prison, to get along,
you gotta go along.

287
00:20:52,956 --> 00:20:55,116
I just wanna do my three years
and be done.

288
00:20:55,325 --> 00:20:58,088
Three years is before
you assaulted Captain Knauer.

289
00:20:58,895 --> 00:21:02,523
Now, you could be with us
for a very long time, Mr. Crewe.

290
00:21:04,635 --> 00:21:06,158
Fine, I'll do it.

291
00:21:07,237 --> 00:21:08,260
Good choice.

292
00:21:09,706 --> 00:21:11,764
But one condition, though.

293
00:21:11,975 --> 00:21:14,704
Gotta promise me to keep
Captain Knauer off my back.

294
00:21:14,911 --> 00:21:15,877
It's a deal.

295
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:18,672
Now, you got four weeks
to assemble a team and train them.

296
00:21:18,882 --> 00:21:22,078
What, are we gonna have a half-hour
a day to practice with a Nerf ball?

297
00:21:22,286 --> 00:21:25,880
Oh, I'll make sure my boys allow you
sufficient freedom, within these walls,

298
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:27,885
to get your team in shape.

299
00:21:32,094 --> 00:21:35,358
What's this? "Football 'tree-outs."'

300
00:21:35,564 --> 00:21:36,894
What the hell is a "tree-out"?

301
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:38,929
"Tryout," you half a meatball.

302
00:21:39,135 --> 00:21:42,126
- What's this football thing about, man?
- Crewe's getting a team together.

303
00:21:42,338 --> 00:21:44,862
- To play against who?
- The guards.

304
00:21:45,074 --> 00:21:48,736
Now, I don't know about y'all,
but I occasionally have the impulse

305
00:21:48,944 --> 00:21:51,741
to physically assault one of our
finer correctional officers.

306
00:21:51,947 --> 00:21:54,141
Yeah? Well, how the hell
we gonna get to do that?

307
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,250
Just show up at the "tree-outs,"
you big, dumb bitch.

308
00:21:58,688 --> 00:22:00,086
Do the girls get to play?

309
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:03,121
We're playing footballs,
not balls-balls.

310
00:22:03,326 --> 00:22:06,624
This is bullshit. Just another chance
for the guards to beat on us.

311
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:09,854
Don't you idiots get it? We could get
a free shot at the guards.

312
00:22:10,065 --> 00:22:12,498
This is our turn.
We could beat up on them.

313
00:22:12,701 --> 00:22:14,258
We could kill them.

314
00:22:15,203 --> 00:22:16,669
Kill them.

315
00:22:22,444 --> 00:22:25,571
You know MVP
sold his own teammates out.

316
00:22:26,214 --> 00:22:28,909
What do you think
he's gonna do to you fools?

317
00:22:30,318 --> 00:22:33,718
And that's the truth.
With some cheese on it.

318
00:22:34,489 --> 00:22:36,456
There ain't no meat loaf
between these buns.

319
00:22:36,658 --> 00:22:38,989
Yo, man, that's my flier, man!
I worked hard on it!

320
00:22:39,194 --> 00:22:42,321
You see? He ran like a little bitch,
right? You saw that, right?

321
00:22:43,131 --> 00:22:45,155
Yo, team needs you.
Team needs you.

322
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:48,233
You sh-- You come to the tr--
Come to the tree-outs.

323
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:56,174
Crappy field, shit-ass equipment...

324
00:22:56,377 --> 00:22:59,402
Hey, man, at least we got some
world-class players over there.

325
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:03,544
Forty-five.

326
00:23:04,318 --> 00:23:06,376
Forty-six.

327
00:23:07,321 --> 00:23:09,015
Forty-seven.

328
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:10,416
He might make the team.

329
00:23:10,624 --> 00:23:12,989
Well, if we gotta cut him,
you're doing it.

330
00:23:13,193 --> 00:23:14,887
Forty-nine.

331
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:17,352
Fifty.

332
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:18,791
- All right, man.
- Good job, man.

333
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:21,466
Well, well, well.
You a football player?

334
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:24,659
Oh, no. I never played
no football, mister.

335
00:23:24,872 --> 00:23:28,034
So, what happened? You read the flier,
thought it looked like some fun?

336
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:29,935
- Oh, I can't read.
- Oh, don't worry.

337
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:31,336
Reading's for rich people.

338
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:35,906
So you know, we're putting together
a football team. Love you to join.

339
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:38,244
Will you teach me to football?

340
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:40,680
Sure we'll teach you to football.
Won't we, Caretaker?

341
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:43,081
Hey, I'll teach you anything.
Just don't eat me.

342
00:23:44,357 --> 00:23:46,221
Okay.

343
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:50,054
Down, Shrek. Down!

344
00:23:50,797 --> 00:23:55,460
Okay, bring it in. Whoever's trying out
for the team, wake up.

345
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:57,157
Can you give a brother
a little hustle?

346
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,059
Very good.

347
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:01,865
For those of you who don't know
who I am, I'm Paul Crewe.

348
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:06,032
I'm gonna be your coach,
your captain, your quarterback.

349
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,234
You haven't played in years.
Why can't I be quarterback?

350
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,437
- You're right. Let's see what you got.
- All right.

351
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:12,775
- Hit me, I'm open.
- Hike, hike! Hike!

352
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,118
That's why.
Now, sit down and shut up.

353
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,219
It slipped. I just ate popcorn.

354
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:20,652
Question: Any of you gentlemen
ever play football before?

355
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,459
- You did? Where?
- Kansas State.

356
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,856
Are you shitting me?
For Coach Snyder?

357
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:27,695
Kansas State Prison.

358
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,025
Now, I hear they have
the softest mattresses out there.

359
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:33,567
Yeah, they do.

360
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,966
Not as soft as the ones
at West Texas Mental lnstitution.

361
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:38,801
- Really?
- Let's finish this conversation later.

362
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,103
For now, I wanna see
what you got out there.

363
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,508
We'll grade them
on a scale of one to ten.

364
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:46,875
Move it! Hustle, hustle, hustle!

365
00:24:47,084 --> 00:24:50,109
Give these guys sixes.
Give these guys fives.

366
00:24:50,321 --> 00:24:52,754
Good. Good.
Give them threes.

367
00:24:52,957 --> 00:24:54,287
Very nice!

368
00:24:55,593 --> 00:24:58,584
- Aren't we missing somebody?
- Where's the Kansas State guy?

369
00:25:01,298 --> 00:25:04,596
You assholes better not cut me!
I'm still on this team!

370
00:25:05,836 --> 00:25:06,859
Negative two.

371
00:25:07,071 --> 00:25:09,095
All right, go with negative two.

372
00:25:09,306 --> 00:25:12,502
Hey! Somebody bring me
a Diet Coke!

373
00:25:12,743 --> 00:25:14,767
- Let's do this!
- That's it!

374
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:16,907
Five.

375
00:25:17,481 --> 00:25:19,380
Good. Seven.

376
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,413
Stupid tire! You're a fricking tire!

377
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,850
You think you're better than me?!
I'll kick your ass!

378
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,256
Three.

379
00:25:30,326 --> 00:25:31,349
And a half?

380
00:25:31,961 --> 00:25:33,928
Yeah. That's better.

381
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,596
Okay. Good.

382
00:25:36,266 --> 00:25:38,927
Yeah. Hit that bag, man.
There you go, man.

383
00:25:39,135 --> 00:25:40,101
Four.

384
00:25:42,472 --> 00:25:44,268
- Five. I don't know.
- I go.

385
00:25:44,474 --> 00:25:46,134
Come on, Switowski!

386
00:25:47,744 --> 00:25:50,303
Daddy!

387
00:25:51,648 --> 00:25:52,978
Oh, man!

388
00:25:53,283 --> 00:25:55,182
- Look at that.
- He got it off the hinge.

389
00:25:55,385 --> 00:25:57,978
- I think that's a ten.
- Let's go with a ten.

390
00:25:58,187 --> 00:26:01,553
I'm sorry. I "brokeded" your toy.

391
00:26:01,758 --> 00:26:04,885
No, that's a good thing. You should
have a victory hug with Caretaker.

392
00:26:05,093 --> 00:26:07,856
What? What you
talking about, man? Hey!

393
00:26:10,332 --> 00:26:11,298
Asshole!

394
00:26:13,235 --> 00:26:15,896
Okay, fellas, it's pretty simple.
You do a buttonhook.

395
00:26:16,104 --> 00:26:18,594
The rest of you guys block for me.
I'll take care of the rest.

396
00:26:18,807 --> 00:26:20,899
Okay? On "go." On "go."

397
00:26:21,109 --> 00:26:23,042
Ready? Break!

398
00:26:26,148 --> 00:26:27,341
We'll work on that.

399
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:31,848
Okay, half speed on this one, guys.
Slow and easy.

400
00:26:32,054 --> 00:26:33,020
Ready?!

401
00:26:33,722 --> 00:26:34,813
Go!

402
00:26:41,796 --> 00:26:43,092
Stop it!

403
00:26:49,303 --> 00:26:50,792
Stop the violence!

404
00:26:51,005 --> 00:26:53,495
Can't we all get along?

405
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,949
- Hey, Paul.
- Unger.

406
00:27:05,152 --> 00:27:07,278
- Team's looking great.
- Oh, yeah.

407
00:27:07,488 --> 00:27:09,216
- So are you.
- Yep. Working on it.

408
00:27:09,423 --> 00:27:14,553
The blood of the guards is gonna flow
like the rivers of ancient Babylon.

409
00:27:14,762 --> 00:27:18,219
That's good news.
Unger, you're the man.

410
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:23,226
Good job today. You're all starting
to look really sharp out there. Yeah.

411
00:27:23,436 --> 00:27:24,732
See you tomorrow.

412
00:27:25,572 --> 00:27:28,369
- We're gonna suck.
- Yeah. No doubt about it.

413
00:27:42,622 --> 00:27:44,589
You look like
you could use a little help.

414
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:49,090
No offense, my man,
but you're a little seasoned.

415
00:27:49,295 --> 00:27:50,283
Seasoned?

416
00:27:50,497 --> 00:27:53,829
I'm not asking to play. I'll coach.
I'm Nate Scarborough.

417
00:27:54,334 --> 00:27:55,994
Nate Scarborough?

418
00:27:57,203 --> 00:27:59,102
The Heisman Trophy winner
from Oklahoma?

419
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:03,230
The inmate from cellblock D.

420
00:28:03,442 --> 00:28:06,899
But about a hundred years ago,
when I could run and gun,

421
00:28:07,379 --> 00:28:09,869
yeah, I was a Sooner then.

422
00:28:10,082 --> 00:28:11,708
I heard you were dead.

423
00:28:11,917 --> 00:28:16,012
No, I ain't dead.
I've been right here, rotting.

424
00:28:16,221 --> 00:28:19,883
Waiting for a chance to get back
at those sadistic guards.

425
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:22,991
Waiting. For this.

426
00:28:23,195 --> 00:28:24,354
Well, coach, as you can see,

427
00:28:24,563 --> 00:28:27,326
we don't exactly have the cream
of the crop to work with here.

428
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:29,762
Well, what are we gonna do?
How are we gonna find players?

429
00:28:29,968 --> 00:28:32,162
How'd they get you
to go to Florida State?

430
00:28:32,871 --> 00:28:33,928
They recruited me.

431
00:28:35,808 --> 00:28:37,536
I'll get the strippers.

432
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:44,002
Well, now, Lindsay, this isn't
about credit or congratulations.

433
00:28:44,215 --> 00:28:46,978
This is about giving men
who've made mistakes in their lives

434
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:49,516
an opportunity
to rise above themselves.

435
00:28:49,721 --> 00:28:52,484
To move beyond
the bars of containment.

436
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:53,978
Say what?

437
00:28:54,826 --> 00:28:57,089
What I would do to you.

438
00:29:09,107 --> 00:29:10,971
Yeah. Nice boot, skin man.

439
00:29:11,175 --> 00:29:13,404
Hey, why does he get to be
the kicker? I was All-State, man.

440
00:29:13,611 --> 00:29:15,373
Let's see what you got.

441
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:17,239
That's why, you dumb-ass.

442
00:29:17,447 --> 00:29:19,243
Just go do some laps.

443
00:29:19,683 --> 00:29:21,206
I heard you boys needed to see me.

444
00:29:21,418 --> 00:29:23,180
Yeah. I want you to meet Skitchy.

445
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,979
Hey, dog.
Check that building over there.

446
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,520
They keep all the records
in the basement.

447
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,022
He's been here so long,
he knows where everything is.

448
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:33,252
That ain't necessarily
a good thing, is it?

449
00:29:33,463 --> 00:29:37,262
I had a parole date in '86.
But I got in a tussle with a guard and...

450
00:29:37,467 --> 00:29:38,865
One punch and it went away.

451
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,660
Twenty extra years for one punch?

452
00:29:40,871 --> 00:29:42,895
Well, unfortunately for him,
the guard he punched

453
00:29:43,106 --> 00:29:44,970
just happens to be the warden now.

454
00:29:45,175 --> 00:29:46,937
Oh, shit. Warden Hazen?

455
00:29:47,144 --> 00:29:48,269
"Oh, shit" is right.

456
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,811
Fight in the yard. Send backup.

457
00:29:53,483 --> 00:29:54,847
Right on time.

458
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:57,108
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

459
00:30:01,824 --> 00:30:04,485
Ain't you guys glad you got
a black man for a friend?

460
00:30:04,693 --> 00:30:06,284
- Hell, yeah.
- Come on.

461
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:16,193
Hazen has a rating system
for every con.

462
00:30:16,405 --> 00:30:17,701
What's three stars?

463
00:30:17,907 --> 00:30:22,741
The more prone to violence that the
inmate is, the more stars he gets.

464
00:30:22,945 --> 00:30:24,343
Five stars is the max.

465
00:30:24,547 --> 00:30:28,073
I didn't know that. Let's see how many
stars my maniacal ass got.

466
00:30:31,353 --> 00:30:35,152
Half a star? That's gotta be a mistake.
Check it again. Check it again.

467
00:30:35,356 --> 00:30:37,323
You're about as maniacal
as a boxful of kittens.

468
00:30:37,525 --> 00:30:38,684
Come on, that's not funny, man.

469
00:30:38,893 --> 00:30:41,417
I'm gonna have to stab somebody
or something. Get my rep up.

470
00:30:41,629 --> 00:30:44,893
Why don't we have a maniacal pillow
fight tonight. That could get it up some.

471
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,631
Yeah. We can sell it to pay-per-view.

472
00:30:47,836 --> 00:30:50,804
Superstar Versus Half-a-Star.

473
00:30:51,406 --> 00:30:54,465
Why don't you shut up before I slit your
throat and watch the dust come out.

474
00:30:54,676 --> 00:30:56,404
Come on, guys,
we only got a couple minutes.

475
00:30:57,145 --> 00:30:58,111
How about this guy?

476
00:30:58,313 --> 00:31:01,110
Damn, this fool got the chair
three times, ain't died yet.

477
00:31:01,316 --> 00:31:03,146
Well, we may not have
the most talented team,

478
00:31:03,351 --> 00:31:05,784
but we will definitely
have the meanest.

479
00:31:41,021 --> 00:31:44,353
- What's he doing that for?
- Because he's a freak.

480
00:31:44,758 --> 00:31:47,783
Hey, Sasquatch!
Someone's here to see you!

481
00:31:47,995 --> 00:31:50,121
Not too smart on your part.

482
00:31:53,532 --> 00:31:55,226
Hey.

483
00:31:56,068 --> 00:31:58,092
How's the headbanging coming?

484
00:32:00,606 --> 00:32:02,630
You're bleeding. Just so you know.

485
00:32:04,677 --> 00:32:07,543
People have told me that
you and I look a lot alike,

486
00:32:07,747 --> 00:32:09,976
so I wanted to see for myself.

487
00:32:12,118 --> 00:32:13,744
I'm gonna take a piss.

488
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,383
You scared him away, dumbshit.

489
00:32:22,895 --> 00:32:26,022
You're kidding. Five-star Torres
likes The View?

490
00:32:26,232 --> 00:32:27,528
No, just Joy Behar.

491
00:32:27,733 --> 00:32:30,599
The good news is she can
breast-feed standing up. That's it.

492
00:32:32,704 --> 00:32:34,933
Where does she come up
with this shit?

493
00:32:36,441 --> 00:32:39,432
I'm a Star Jones man myself.
I love that big bitch.

494
00:32:39,945 --> 00:32:41,605
That was, like, the furthest thing.

495
00:32:41,813 --> 00:32:43,404
I got married so young, so, I mean,

496
00:32:43,615 --> 00:32:45,878
they weren't pressuring me,
the society was pressuring me...

497
00:32:46,084 --> 00:32:47,573
Mr. T orres.

498
00:32:47,786 --> 00:32:50,276
Us convicts are starting up
a football team.

499
00:32:50,488 --> 00:32:51,852
Not interested.

500
00:32:52,424 --> 00:32:53,685
We're playing the guards.

501
00:32:55,627 --> 00:32:56,923
Walk away.

502
00:32:57,762 --> 00:32:59,194
Good idea.

503
00:32:59,631 --> 00:33:01,063
0 for 2.

504
00:33:01,466 --> 00:33:03,433
You're putting the pressure
on her right now.

505
00:33:03,635 --> 00:33:05,033
Show's over, amigo.

506
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:08,561
I still got 15 minutes of Joy Behar.

507
00:33:08,772 --> 00:33:13,265
Well, I'm cutting you short.
Back to your cell, asswipe.

508
00:33:13,677 --> 00:33:14,904
Hey, white boy.

509
00:33:17,648 --> 00:33:19,478
Cherryhead gonna play?

510
00:33:20,451 --> 00:33:21,678
Yes, he is.

511
00:33:27,891 --> 00:33:29,585
Crewe, don't forget,
I'm gonna be open.

512
00:33:30,194 --> 00:33:31,558
Green 40! Hut!

513
00:33:37,801 --> 00:33:39,233
Damn!

514
00:33:40,804 --> 00:33:43,533
Brucie. Brucie. You all right?
You breathing?

515
00:33:44,108 --> 00:33:47,042
I got a bird. His name is Ronnie.

516
00:33:47,243 --> 00:33:50,143
Well, tell Ronnie you got
knocked the fuck out.

517
00:33:53,082 --> 00:33:57,347
Wow, no bullshit. Real football?
Against the guards?

518
00:33:57,553 --> 00:33:58,712
Full contact.

519
00:33:59,022 --> 00:34:00,648
Captain Knauer is their quarterback?

520
00:34:01,924 --> 00:34:05,051
- Yep.
- So I get to tackle him?

521
00:34:05,261 --> 00:34:08,058
Yeah. You can either tackle him or hit
him over the head with that hammer.

522
00:34:09,499 --> 00:34:11,989
I wanna hurt him. Not kill him.

523
00:34:12,335 --> 00:34:14,393
Let's get out of here
before that thing bites somebody.

524
00:34:14,604 --> 00:34:17,800
All right. We'll see you
and your pet iguana at practice.

525
00:34:19,242 --> 00:34:20,799
Down, set!

526
00:34:24,013 --> 00:34:25,377
Hut! Hut!

527
00:34:29,284 --> 00:34:30,409
Hey!

528
00:34:31,453 --> 00:34:33,044
- Hit me.
- Get rid of it.

529
00:34:34,056 --> 00:34:35,579
Get rid of it!

530
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,723
He didn't get rid of it.

531
00:34:40,762 --> 00:34:42,092
Sacked your ass.

532
00:34:43,098 --> 00:34:45,565
Somebody's gotta get open, guys.

533
00:34:45,767 --> 00:34:47,233
You got hammered by the hammer.

534
00:34:47,436 --> 00:34:50,461
I think I felt it on my leg.
We gotta get some speed, man.

535
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,571
What'd you expect?
You got no brothers out there.

536
00:34:52,774 --> 00:34:54,536
What are you talking about?
We got Switowski.

537
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,670
Switowski? That's one brother.

538
00:34:57,879 --> 00:34:59,778
That's a lonely nigga.
This ain't hockey.

539
00:35:00,449 --> 00:35:02,541
You want some speed,
you know where to go.

540
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:13,686
Hey, yo, check out
this fake Slim Shady, man.

541
00:35:15,129 --> 00:35:17,358
I knew you couldn't resist my shit.

542
00:35:17,565 --> 00:35:19,759
I got the shakes
that'll make you quake.

543
00:35:19,967 --> 00:35:22,764
I got the fries that'll cross your eyes.

544
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,960
I got the burgers that'll--

545
00:35:27,408 --> 00:35:28,806
I just got burgers.

546
00:35:29,009 --> 00:35:30,066
I'm all right. Thank you.

547
00:35:30,478 --> 00:35:34,436
Just wanted to talk to you fellas about
possibly joining the football team.

548
00:35:35,282 --> 00:35:36,805
The only game we'd play with you is

549
00:35:37,017 --> 00:35:41,953
Slap the Point-Shaving White Boy
Till He Cries Like a Baby-Back Bitch.

550
00:35:42,222 --> 00:35:46,248
Baby-back bitch, baby-back bitch
Baby-back bitch

551
00:35:46,459 --> 00:35:48,619
- That's a big-ass robot.
- Yeah.

552
00:35:53,466 --> 00:35:55,524
You gonna help me out here?

553
00:35:57,604 --> 00:35:58,900
Thank you, Half-a-Star.

554
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,806
Just so you know,
we are playing the guards.

555
00:36:02,008 --> 00:36:04,771
That ain't a team.
That's just a bunch of dumb rednecks

556
00:36:04,978 --> 00:36:07,468
giving themselves excuses
to grab each other.

557
00:36:08,581 --> 00:36:10,775
This guy must be
quite the athlete, huh?

558
00:36:11,518 --> 00:36:14,953
You risk bringing your ass in the jungle
because you know I am.

559
00:36:15,155 --> 00:36:18,317
Yeah, so you'd beat me
in a game of one-on-one, right?

560
00:36:18,525 --> 00:36:21,618
- What?
- I think it's time for you to get stepping.

561
00:36:21,827 --> 00:36:23,953
How's this, though? One game.

562
00:36:24,163 --> 00:36:28,326
I beat you, you guys play for the team.
You beat me, I'll leave you alone.

563
00:36:29,368 --> 00:36:31,426
Take that. Take that, Deac.

564
00:36:31,637 --> 00:36:33,763
This fool ain't nothing
but a thing, baby.

565
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,367
- Ball, dog.
- Ball up!

566
00:36:37,576 --> 00:36:38,940
Can Crewe play ball?

567
00:36:39,144 --> 00:36:40,405
He's a natural athlete.

568
00:36:40,612 --> 00:36:43,876
So is Greg Louganis, but I bet you
he'd get his ass whupped out here.

569
00:36:44,383 --> 00:36:46,714
- Game's 1 1. Call your own fouls.
- Okay.

570
00:36:48,153 --> 00:36:50,313
- Come on, come on.
- Give it to him, Deac!

571
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,351
Did I get you?

572
00:36:56,995 --> 00:36:58,291
No, that was clean.

573
00:36:58,497 --> 00:37:00,464
He'll be all right. Call his mama.

574
00:37:00,665 --> 00:37:03,132
- If I foul you, tell me, dog.
- Okay, baby.

575
00:37:07,171 --> 00:37:08,660
Take this f-- Take this foul.

576
00:37:12,243 --> 00:37:14,210
What happened there?
I think it's my ball, right?

577
00:37:14,445 --> 00:37:15,411
All right.

578
00:37:15,613 --> 00:37:17,375
Get up! Get up, Deac!

579
00:37:17,715 --> 00:37:18,738
Come on, Paul!

580
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,041
- Calm down.
- What?

581
00:37:20,251 --> 00:37:22,684
Now, don't stir up
the brothers, now. Come on.

582
00:37:27,391 --> 00:37:28,880
Come on, Deacon!

583
00:37:33,197 --> 00:37:34,390
Did I get you, dog?

584
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:37,431
Hell, no, baby. That was clean.
Good D.

585
00:37:37,634 --> 00:37:38,998
I thought he didn't wanna get hurt.

586
00:37:39,202 --> 00:37:41,726
It ain't about getting hurt.
It's about pride.

587
00:37:41,938 --> 00:37:43,837
I bet you he's pretty proud right now.

588
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:21,865
It ain't easy being cheesy!

589
00:38:29,051 --> 00:38:31,314
Did I get you? Did I get you?

590
00:38:31,553 --> 00:38:34,112
- No, I think I'm okay, baby.
- I didn't get you, did l?

591
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,257
That's traveling, bitch.

592
00:38:53,309 --> 00:38:54,775
You keep coming, huh?

593
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:59,436
Game point, baby.
How you want the game put up?

594
00:39:06,187 --> 00:39:07,244
Foul.

595
00:39:09,123 --> 00:39:11,215
That was a bullshit call!

596
00:39:14,429 --> 00:39:16,328
My court, my ball.

597
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:29,867
All right, y'all. Let Deac speak!

598
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,108
Nice spanking that ass, dog.

599
00:39:35,816 --> 00:39:38,181
- Now, get stepping.
- Hold up.

600
00:39:42,122 --> 00:39:43,486
Y'all got a running back?

601
00:39:44,057 --> 00:39:45,683
Not any good ones.

602
00:39:46,093 --> 00:39:47,491
No disrespect, Deac...

603
00:39:48,528 --> 00:39:51,189
...but any man that can take
that kind of beating out here,

604
00:39:51,398 --> 00:39:54,059
I can't wait to see what he can do
in a contact sport.

605
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:55,233
Shit, I'm in.

606
00:39:56,837 --> 00:40:01,239
Man, give me that cheeseburger.
You acting like a real McAsshole.

607
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:04,898
Cheeseburger, he wants to run
with the white boys, we will let him.

608
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:06,578
Let's do this.

609
00:40:07,514 --> 00:40:08,480
Earl Megget.

610
00:40:08,682 --> 00:40:12,947
Well, we didn't get the whole chocolate
bar, but we got a Hershey's Kiss.

611
00:40:13,152 --> 00:40:14,209
I'll take it.

612
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,881
Let's get this over with, rookie,
I'm starving.

613
00:40:19,091 --> 00:40:21,752
Fresh meat, boys! Fresh meat!

614
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,552
Down, set!

615
00:40:24,163 --> 00:40:25,754
Battle, you're a psycho!

616
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,932
Tony, you're a fat shit! Hut!

617
00:40:36,675 --> 00:40:37,936
Holy shit!

618
00:40:42,515 --> 00:40:44,209
Get him!

619
00:40:51,956 --> 00:40:55,152
Ran right out of your shoes, huh?
Hey, manager, don't you think

620
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,691
we can get our new star running back
a decent pair of cleats?

621
00:40:57,896 --> 00:41:01,023
Yeah. I think I got a cousin
that drives a truck for Reebok.

622
00:41:01,232 --> 00:41:03,631
It's cool, man.
I never had shoes growing up noway.

623
00:41:03,835 --> 00:41:05,529
- I'll be all right for now.
- Oh, okay.

624
00:41:06,237 --> 00:41:08,227
Get your country ass
back in the huddle.

625
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,031
That boy got some slave feet,
you see that?

626
00:41:12,444 --> 00:41:14,536
Defense! Huddle up over there!

627
00:41:14,746 --> 00:41:16,542
Paul. Paul.

628
00:41:16,748 --> 00:41:18,806
Hey, ladies. How's it hanging?

629
00:41:19,017 --> 00:41:21,041
- Tell him.
- I'm gonna say something to him.

630
00:41:21,252 --> 00:41:24,220
I just wanted to let you know
I am your biggest fan.

631
00:41:24,422 --> 00:41:28,448
And I will be cheering my jailhouse
boobies off for you at game day.

632
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,126
I appreciate that. Thank you.

633
00:41:30,327 --> 00:41:31,793
Paul.

634
00:41:32,596 --> 00:41:34,392
I appreciate you.

635
00:41:34,965 --> 00:41:36,955
Okay, thanks. I'm glad to know that.

636
00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:40,335
Okay, are you done now?

637
00:41:40,537 --> 00:41:43,198
What's wrong with you? Jealous
because I don't cheer for you anymore?

638
00:41:43,407 --> 00:41:45,601
I don't know what
you're talking about, freak show.

639
00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:47,435
Whatever, back freckles.

640
00:41:47,978 --> 00:41:50,309
Oh, yeah, back freckles.
She's making up shit now.

641
00:41:50,514 --> 00:41:51,946
I'm gonna get some water.

642
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,813
That feature interview
worked better than I thought.

643
00:41:56,019 --> 00:41:58,179
I just got off the phone with ESPN2.

644
00:41:58,388 --> 00:42:01,151
They want to televise
the football game.

645
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:04,849
Guards, cons, Paul Crewe,
it's compelling stuff.

646
00:42:05,062 --> 00:42:07,188
Lots of human interest.

647
00:42:07,397 --> 00:42:09,159
Don't do that in here.

648
00:42:10,366 --> 00:42:11,764
Television.

649
00:42:12,835 --> 00:42:15,064
Dandridge, do you think
that might help my visibility

650
00:42:15,271 --> 00:42:17,295
with the registered voters
of this fine state?

651
00:42:17,673 --> 00:42:19,037
Oh, yes.

652
00:42:35,658 --> 00:42:37,454
The freak is back!

653
00:42:50,605 --> 00:42:52,196
Hey, hey. It's me again.

654
00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:57,600
You know, if I take this half down,
we could play together.

655
00:42:59,848 --> 00:43:01,940
I'm just gonna take this half down.

656
00:43:05,353 --> 00:43:07,980
Don't worry. Don't worry.
I got another ball.

657
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,486
It's okay.

658
00:43:11,126 --> 00:43:12,524
You wanna serve?

659
00:43:13,995 --> 00:43:15,154
I'll serve.

660
00:43:21,069 --> 00:43:23,935
Really good news.
We started a football team.

661
00:43:24,306 --> 00:43:25,772
You like football?

662
00:43:25,973 --> 00:43:27,405
It's kind of like Ping-Pong.

663
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:30,940
Only the ball's a little bigger
and egg-shaped, like my head.

664
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:35,145
Just a joke. Stay calm.

665
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:38,078
Give you a good chance
to throw people on the ground,

666
00:43:38,285 --> 00:43:42,584
hurt them like you used to when you
were a kid, 10 feet 6 inches ago.

667
00:43:44,959 --> 00:43:46,949
We'd be playing the guards.

668
00:43:50,397 --> 00:43:52,364
I think Papajohn's their safety.

669
00:44:10,683 --> 00:44:13,549
Turley, nobody gets to me.
We'll play more Ping-Pong later, okay?

670
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,656
Hut!

671
00:44:23,196 --> 00:44:24,287
Effective.

672
00:44:25,098 --> 00:44:28,658
- All right.
- He brokeded my nose.

673
00:44:31,738 --> 00:44:33,534
I don't wanna play no more.

674
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,969
Hey, hey, hey. Switowski,
what are you talking about?

675
00:44:36,175 --> 00:44:37,801
This is football. Shit happens.

676
00:44:38,011 --> 00:44:40,672
Paul, he brokeded my nose.

677
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,312
Okay. Stop crying.

678
00:44:42,848 --> 00:44:45,475
All right. We can fix this.
Here we go.

679
00:44:46,885 --> 00:44:49,250
Okay. Good, good.

680
00:44:50,055 --> 00:44:51,043
How's it look?

681
00:44:51,256 --> 00:44:54,588
How's it look? It looks-- It looks like--
It looks better than before.

682
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,686
- Really?
- Yeah, it's straighter.

683
00:44:57,896 --> 00:45:01,023
More distinguished.
Kind of like a young Michael Jackson.

684
00:45:01,233 --> 00:45:03,427
I love little Michael.

685
00:45:03,635 --> 00:45:05,295
That's great. That's great.

686
00:45:06,638 --> 00:45:08,298
I think he did it on purpose.

687
00:45:08,507 --> 00:45:10,440
No, he didn't.

688
00:45:12,577 --> 00:45:14,134
Okay, maybe he did.

689
00:45:14,346 --> 00:45:17,246
You gotta apologize to him.
Come on, Turley.

690
00:45:18,884 --> 00:45:20,510
Say you're sorry.

691
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:23,976
Come on. Say it.

692
00:45:27,792 --> 00:45:31,158
He said he's sorry.
I got him to say he's sorry.

693
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:32,953
Yeah, yeah. We're all impressed.

694
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,064
Looking good, gentlemen.
Way to work hard.

695
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:40,429
Good practice, Paul!
Me and the girls wanna show you

696
00:45:40,638 --> 00:45:41,905
- what we've been practicing.
- Okay, hit me.

697
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:43,133
- what we've been practicing.
- Okay, hit me.

698
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:46,503
Come on, let's go. One, two, three.

699
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:49,611
Give me a...

700
00:45:49,814 --> 00:45:53,112
D, D, give me a I
I, I, give me a C

701
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:54,305
C, give me a--

702
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:57,782
All right, all right! I got it.
Just save it for the game.

703
00:45:57,988 --> 00:45:59,852
Don't act like you ain't
want to see more, Brucie!

704
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:02,217
- Yeah, you wish, pal.
- No, you wish I'd kiss you again,

705
00:46:02,425 --> 00:46:05,359
because your breath
smell like eight cans of shark shit.

706
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:07,085
I wouldn't touch her
with a 10-foot pole.

707
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:08,854
- What's he talking about?
- He's a freak.

708
00:46:22,378 --> 00:46:24,777
Run, Forrest, run!

709
00:46:29,352 --> 00:46:31,842
That's how a white man plays guitar.

710
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:37,450
Captain, he said he had some info.

711
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:41,117
You guys have "Halo 2."
I didn't even think that was out yet.

712
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:43,626
Focus. Turn the music off!

713
00:46:43,832 --> 00:46:45,992
Yeah, captain.
You know them convicts?

714
00:46:46,201 --> 00:46:48,031
They're starting to get
some serious players.

715
00:46:48,237 --> 00:46:51,364
But their biggest threat?
A running back. Megget.

716
00:46:51,573 --> 00:46:53,972
- He's good?
- He's fast.

717
00:46:54,176 --> 00:46:56,507
He's really, really fast.

718
00:46:56,712 --> 00:47:00,738
I mean, he's so fast,
he makes fast people look not fast.

719
00:47:00,949 --> 00:47:02,313
I got it, he's fast.

720
00:47:02,518 --> 00:47:05,384
Now, why don't you show us your speed
and get your pyro ass out of here.

721
00:47:06,255 --> 00:47:09,087
Yes, sir. Here I go. I'm sorry.

722
00:47:21,335 --> 00:47:24,531
Any books
you'd recommend, inmate?

723
00:47:26,374 --> 00:47:27,340
No, sir.

724
00:47:29,544 --> 00:47:31,067
Not much of a reader.

725
00:47:31,445 --> 00:47:35,642
Oh, come on, now, maggot.
I've seen you in here reading before.

726
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:38,113
You requested this detail.
Isn't that right?

727
00:47:41,856 --> 00:47:45,086
No. It's the quiet time I like, sir.

728
00:47:46,027 --> 00:47:47,323
Maybe you'd like to read this.

729
00:47:49,497 --> 00:47:51,657
What the hell kind of bullshit
book is that?

730
00:47:51,866 --> 00:47:54,197
It's historical. Sir.

731
00:47:54,402 --> 00:47:56,961
Now, why would he want to read
a book about a four-eyed nigger?

732
00:48:01,708 --> 00:48:05,609
Does the N word
offend you, nigger?

733
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,007
No, sir.

734
00:48:15,222 --> 00:48:17,189
Sorry about that.

735
00:48:17,657 --> 00:48:20,420
You mind fetching
these books for me, boy?

736
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:24,762
No, sir.

737
00:48:24,965 --> 00:48:26,864
Just pick them up.
Put them on the table.

738
00:48:30,503 --> 00:48:31,696
There you go.

739
00:48:37,343 --> 00:48:39,207
You forgot one.

740
00:48:46,118 --> 00:48:47,584
Bet you'd like to hit us, huh?

741
00:48:48,954 --> 00:48:51,012
Hit you, sir? No.

742
00:48:54,026 --> 00:48:55,253
Y'all my friends.

743
00:48:59,999 --> 00:49:01,488
Pick these up.

744
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:23,779
Go!

745
00:49:24,689 --> 00:49:26,417
Hit me! I'm open! I'm open!

746
00:49:30,962 --> 00:49:33,361
Come on! We got one week
before we play that game.

747
00:49:33,564 --> 00:49:34,962
We can't complete a pass yet.

748
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:38,623
- Megget can't run the ball every play.
- I know, coach.

749
00:49:39,237 --> 00:49:41,204
What the hell is he smiling at?

750
00:49:57,087 --> 00:49:58,815
This better be on the up and up.

751
00:49:59,923 --> 00:50:00,980
I guarantee it.

752
00:50:01,491 --> 00:50:02,889
Let's do this shit.

753
00:50:03,093 --> 00:50:04,650
There goes the neighborhood.

754
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,328
Now I'll never get to play.

755
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:41,520
Did you see that? Did you see that?
The Deac is here!

756
00:50:41,731 --> 00:50:42,856
Nice.

757
00:50:43,299 --> 00:50:44,890
Okay, we seal off here, seal off here.

758
00:50:45,101 --> 00:50:46,567
- Cheeseburger.
- Yeah.

759
00:50:46,769 --> 00:50:48,429
You're just gonna chip this guy...

760
00:51:06,155 --> 00:51:07,121
That stings.

761
00:51:07,323 --> 00:51:10,086
It's nothing a Quarter Pounder
can't fix.

762
00:51:12,794 --> 00:51:13,919
With cheese on it?

763
00:51:14,129 --> 00:51:15,652
Hut!

764
00:51:40,321 --> 00:51:42,584
Man, that boy would catch a cold
in the desert. Here you go.

765
00:51:42,791 --> 00:51:45,384
- Everything's looking up.
- Yeah.

766
00:51:45,593 --> 00:51:47,890
Still got one more
pain in the ass to deal with.

767
00:51:58,138 --> 00:52:00,298
All right, what do you say?
How about a little best ball?

768
00:52:00,507 --> 00:52:03,566
No, I hate that bullshit.
Everyone play their own damn ball.

769
00:52:03,777 --> 00:52:05,607
Holy shit, is that Paul Crewe?

770
00:52:05,813 --> 00:52:09,543
How do you like that, boys?
The MVP coming to kiss my ass.

771
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:12,510
So, what's on your mind, Paul?

772
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:14,447
Got a problem with inmate Unger.

773
00:52:15,522 --> 00:52:18,581
- Is he on your little squad?
- I believe he's on your little squad.

774
00:52:19,326 --> 00:52:22,123
Mr. Crewe, would you mind
if we had a picture? Please?

775
00:52:22,963 --> 00:52:24,259
That's up to the warden.

776
00:52:24,898 --> 00:52:27,263
- Damn it. All right.
- Rewound it. Did everything.

777
00:52:27,467 --> 00:52:29,900
- The flash is ready.
- You don't need a flash. It's daylight.

778
00:52:30,103 --> 00:52:32,263
Oh, my bad.
I just want a good picture.

779
00:52:32,805 --> 00:52:36,103
You know, I think you had sex
with my wife before I married her.

780
00:52:37,176 --> 00:52:38,870
- Sorry about that.
- Oh, hell, no.

781
00:52:39,078 --> 00:52:42,274
If she's hot enough to have
a one-nighter with a pro football player,

782
00:52:42,482 --> 00:52:44,278
I must be doing all right.

783
00:52:44,817 --> 00:52:46,283
Okay, here we go.

784
00:52:46,986 --> 00:52:49,180
- Sergeant Engleheart?
- Yes, warden.

785
00:52:49,388 --> 00:52:51,218
Would you step out
of the picture, please?

786
00:52:51,858 --> 00:52:52,949
Yes, sir.

787
00:52:55,495 --> 00:52:57,962
- His wife has got the hottest ass.
- Great.

788
00:52:58,164 --> 00:52:59,460
Just cut to the chase, shall we?

789
00:53:00,099 --> 00:53:02,828
You don't actually think you have
a chance of winning, now, do you?

790
00:53:03,035 --> 00:53:04,695
We're gonna get
our asses handed to us.

791
00:53:04,904 --> 00:53:09,306
I know it. You know it.
I just don't want my players to know it.

792
00:53:09,508 --> 00:53:10,974
Your players?

793
00:53:12,677 --> 00:53:15,304
Just when I thought
I had you all figured out.

794
00:53:15,514 --> 00:53:17,504
- What does that mean?
- In the time you've been here,

795
00:53:17,716 --> 00:53:19,808
you haven't made or received
one telephone call.

796
00:53:20,018 --> 00:53:22,485
You haven't opened so much
as a single shred of mail.

797
00:53:22,687 --> 00:53:25,018
What do you give a damn
about those slimeballs?

798
00:53:25,223 --> 00:53:27,315
You never cared about anybody
in your entire life.

799
00:53:27,859 --> 00:53:30,053
Well, maybe I finally found
that sense of family

800
00:53:30,262 --> 00:53:32,661
I been yearning for since I'm a baby.

801
00:53:32,864 --> 00:53:33,955
And gosh almighty,

802
00:53:34,166 --> 00:53:35,826
my new family and l
would sure appreciate it

803
00:53:36,034 --> 00:53:38,467
if you got Unger off the field.
You hear?

804
00:53:40,071 --> 00:53:41,367
Sergeant Engleheart.

805
00:53:41,873 --> 00:53:43,066
Thank you.

806
00:53:43,642 --> 00:53:45,165
Oh, and as for your request...

807
00:53:47,278 --> 00:53:49,711
...you'll have my answer
soon enough.

808
00:54:02,626 --> 00:54:04,422
Did it rain last night?

809
00:54:04,628 --> 00:54:05,855
Not a drop.

810
00:54:10,734 --> 00:54:12,530
Son of a bitch.

811
00:54:12,903 --> 00:54:14,631
All right, boys.

812
00:54:17,875 --> 00:54:20,968
The warden is trying
to break our spirit.

813
00:54:21,745 --> 00:54:23,712
He thinks we're gonna
skip practice today,

814
00:54:23,913 --> 00:54:26,540
wait for the field to dry,
make it up tomorrow.

815
00:54:26,749 --> 00:54:27,976
You know what? Who gives a shit?

816
00:54:28,184 --> 00:54:31,016
Three days till game time.
We can handle it.

817
00:54:31,221 --> 00:54:33,051
But let me say this:

818
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:37,550
That old man flooding this field
tells me something.

819
00:54:38,695 --> 00:54:41,128
The guy is scared.

820
00:54:41,331 --> 00:54:45,824
Scared of you sick,
degenerate convicts.

821
00:54:46,035 --> 00:54:47,763
And you know what?

822
00:54:49,239 --> 00:54:50,637
He should be.

823
00:54:50,974 --> 00:54:52,907
Because I got news for you guys.

824
00:54:53,309 --> 00:54:54,502
We're gonna win this thing.

825
00:54:56,012 --> 00:54:57,569
Did he say "win"?

826
00:54:58,114 --> 00:55:00,081
What's it gonna be, boys?

827
00:55:01,317 --> 00:55:04,514
Do we go back to our cells,
call it a day?

828
00:55:04,887 --> 00:55:09,790
Or do we get ourselves ready
for the greatest ass-kicking fiesta

829
00:55:09,993 --> 00:55:12,120
in the history of football?

830
00:55:12,962 --> 00:55:14,759
I'll leave it up to you guys.

831
00:55:34,851 --> 00:55:38,184
Hey. You're part
of the goddamn team.

832
00:55:38,388 --> 00:55:41,016
Get your point-shaving ass in there.

833
00:55:41,658 --> 00:55:42,920
You got it.

834
00:56:29,106 --> 00:56:32,200
I guess that asshole Hazen
wants to play dirty.

835
00:56:32,409 --> 00:56:35,344
- We all convicts, right?
- Right.

836
00:56:35,546 --> 00:56:37,537
Maybe it's time
we started acting like it.

837
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:40,749
Right here. Right here.

838
00:56:42,786 --> 00:56:43,946
Take it, Deac.

839
00:56:44,154 --> 00:56:47,123
Let's see which guards
have some broken bones.

840
00:57:06,544 --> 00:57:07,511
Yeah!

841
00:57:45,418 --> 00:57:46,783
Shoes, nigga!

842
00:57:57,363 --> 00:58:01,561
Check this out. These be brass
knuckles. They damn near old as me.

843
00:58:01,767 --> 00:58:03,257
Hut!

844
00:58:03,469 --> 00:58:06,438
That's perfect, Cheeseburger!
Never been better.

845
00:58:17,283 --> 00:58:18,307
Good ball. Good ball.

846
00:58:22,221 --> 00:58:23,620
Okay.

847
00:58:26,425 --> 00:58:28,256
- Who we gonna crush?
- The guards!

848
00:58:28,461 --> 00:58:30,326
- Who we gonna kill?
- The guards!

849
00:58:30,529 --> 00:58:32,497
- Who we gonna kiss?
- The guards!

850
00:58:32,698 --> 00:58:33,665
Gotcha.

851
00:58:43,844 --> 00:58:45,334
Lights out!

852
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,777
Good night, ladies.

853
00:58:54,054 --> 00:58:56,716
- Yo, Crewe!
- Yes, Mr. Caretaker.

854
00:58:56,923 --> 00:59:00,256
Check your toilet. There should be
a little surprise in there for you.

855
00:59:00,594 --> 00:59:02,323
You took a shit in my toilet?

856
00:59:02,529 --> 00:59:05,191
No, that's the surprise
I left in Brucie's toilet.

857
00:59:05,398 --> 00:59:07,696
- You got something else.
- All right.

858
00:59:08,535 --> 00:59:10,093
Well, would you look at this.

859
00:59:10,303 --> 00:59:14,171
A bottle of Ketel One
and two glasses?

860
00:59:14,374 --> 00:59:15,807
Now, what would I need two for?

861
00:59:16,009 --> 00:59:17,977
Just shut up
and pour me a drink, bitch.

862
00:59:18,211 --> 00:59:22,671
- Man, who taught you to be so cool?
- My mama.

863
00:59:23,116 --> 00:59:27,246
Now, when I get out of here, I don't
want you to get all Hollywood on us.

864
00:59:27,454 --> 00:59:28,819
I want you to meet her.

865
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:32,117
Here, look at my girl.
She's your biggest fan.

866
00:59:34,128 --> 00:59:35,755
Your mom's beautiful.

867
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,924
And you, you are ugly.

868
00:59:39,133 --> 00:59:41,260
Thank you. Got it.

869
00:59:42,236 --> 00:59:44,136
Here's to...

870
00:59:45,172 --> 00:59:48,073
...the first friend I've had
in I don't know how long.

871
00:59:48,276 --> 00:59:50,369
Hey, I thought
I was your friend, Paul.

872
00:59:50,578 --> 00:59:54,674
You are, Switowski. Just finish your
coloring book and go back to sleep.

873
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:55,849
Okay.

874
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:58,878
And here's to having one of these
with you on the outside,

875
00:59:59,086 --> 01:00:01,418
sometime in the next
three to five years.

876
01:00:03,524 --> 01:00:05,253
- Yo, Crewe.
- Yes, sir.

877
01:00:05,459 --> 01:00:07,893
You being a ex-football player
and all,

878
01:00:08,095 --> 01:00:10,120
I'm sure you got a lot
of hot ass on the outside.

879
01:00:10,331 --> 01:00:13,459
Well, let's not forget I wasn't
the most popular guy out there.

880
01:00:13,668 --> 01:00:14,635
Don't give me that shit.

881
01:00:14,835 --> 01:00:16,894
O.J. chopped his wife's head off
and still got some ass.

882
01:00:17,838 --> 01:00:19,100
Yeah.

883
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:22,376
My mama taught me not to kiss
and tell. Now, go to sleep.

884
01:00:22,578 --> 01:00:24,603
All right. I got one more question
to ask you.

885
01:00:25,047 --> 01:00:26,844
Okay. What is it?

886
01:00:29,518 --> 01:00:31,179
Why'd you shave those points?

887
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:37,217
Didn't you read the papers?
I'm innocent.

888
01:00:37,426 --> 01:00:39,690
Yeah. Ain't we all?

889
01:00:42,297 --> 01:00:43,787
Yo, Crewe, what would you say

890
01:00:43,999 --> 01:00:47,093
if I could get you film
from the guards' games last year?

891
01:00:47,302 --> 01:00:49,600
I would say that's incredible,
but how?

892
01:00:50,405 --> 01:00:51,838
Thanks, gentlemen.

893
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:55,635
The warden will be done with him
in 15 minutes.

894
01:00:56,545 --> 01:00:59,446
- We can handle him.
- Yes, ma'am.

895
01:00:59,648 --> 01:01:01,445
Then you're gonna, ma'am.

896
01:01:05,988 --> 01:01:07,319
Nice job.

897
01:01:10,025 --> 01:01:13,654
I can't tell you how much this means
to me. Thank you, Lynette.

898
01:01:13,862 --> 01:01:16,228
Now Nate can study
all the guards' formations.

899
01:01:16,432 --> 01:01:19,230
Not so fast, sugar bear.

900
01:01:19,435 --> 01:01:21,460
You gotta earn them.

901
01:01:31,447 --> 01:01:33,039
We only got 1 5 minutes,

902
01:01:33,249 --> 01:01:37,151
but, sunshine, we're gonna
make them all count.

903
01:01:50,033 --> 01:01:51,762
One more, please?

904
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:01,638
Let's go.

905
01:02:09,253 --> 01:02:11,312
- Quiet down. Guys.
- Let's go.

906
01:02:11,522 --> 01:02:14,355
Before we watch the guards'
game film from last season,

907
01:02:14,558 --> 01:02:19,018
we have a special presentation
from our very own Mr. Paul Crewe.

908
01:02:20,864 --> 01:02:22,661
What are you talking about?

909
01:02:24,068 --> 01:02:25,558
What's going on?

910
01:02:29,807 --> 01:02:32,173
Now I gotta relive this shit?

911
01:02:48,258 --> 01:02:49,953
Yeah!

912
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:55,924
You can say this,
my man's a team player!

913
01:02:57,768 --> 01:03:01,898
You know what they say. Once
you go gray, there ain't no other way!

914
01:03:02,273 --> 01:03:05,208
Hey, hey, hey. Brucie! Brucie!
I'm glad you think that's funny,

915
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:07,469
because I got something pretty funny
to show you guys.

916
01:03:07,679 --> 01:03:10,045
Tony, hit it. You're gonna like this.

917
01:03:17,522 --> 01:03:20,980
- What the hell is this?
- What? It's good. It keeps going.

918
01:03:21,192 --> 01:03:23,319
- Hi.
- Here I am.

919
01:03:23,528 --> 01:03:25,223
Turn this shit off. Turn it off.

920
01:03:25,897 --> 01:03:27,194
No!

921
01:03:32,771 --> 01:03:35,239
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very funny.
Trick photography.

922
01:03:44,783 --> 01:03:46,080
Nothing happened.
Nothing happened.

923
01:03:46,284 --> 01:03:48,149
I was showing a little wrestling move.
That's all.

924
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:49,953
Knock it off!

925
01:03:50,155 --> 01:03:51,554
Knock it off!

926
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:54,320
It's time we took a look
at what we came here to see

927
01:03:54,526 --> 01:03:56,460
before the guards come back.

928
01:03:57,897 --> 01:04:01,298
The first film is the guards' offense
against Texas Southern.

929
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,731
Now, as you can see,
they're running a standard wishbone.

930
01:04:11,744 --> 01:04:14,440
So you're telling me that these animals
are watching our game films.

931
01:04:14,647 --> 01:04:16,478
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir, boss.

932
01:04:16,682 --> 01:04:18,149
They got all last season.

933
01:04:19,084 --> 01:04:21,609
Seems to me that we ought to
do something about this.

934
01:04:21,821 --> 01:04:23,482
What do you want me to do?

935
01:04:23,689 --> 01:04:25,850
You're the criminal. Be creative.

936
01:04:26,292 --> 01:04:29,284
But on game day, if I so much as--

937
01:04:32,231 --> 01:04:33,198
What are you doing?

938
01:04:34,867 --> 01:04:38,132
I don't know.
I've had hot flashes all shift,

939
01:04:38,337 --> 01:04:40,635
and now my nipples are killing me.

940
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,467
Why are we talking about
your nipples?

941
01:04:42,942 --> 01:04:45,433
We're not. Just go do
what you're doing there.

942
01:04:45,644 --> 01:04:47,009
Guys.

943
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:51,215
I want Crewe finished.

944
01:04:51,418 --> 01:04:55,548
Yes, sir. You give me the inspiration,
sir. I got something for him.

945
01:04:56,756 --> 01:04:57,984
Hut!

946
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:05,363
Everybody!

947
01:05:06,967 --> 01:05:08,195
Huddle up!

948
01:05:12,138 --> 01:05:16,871
Every day we've been taking shit,
for a long time.

949
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:22,311
Tomorrow, payback.
Now, think about that for a second.

950
01:06:07,295 --> 01:06:09,422
- What time is it?
- Game time!

951
01:06:09,630 --> 01:06:11,257
- What time is it?
- Game time!

952
01:06:11,465 --> 01:06:14,923
- What time is it?
- Game time!

953
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:22,369
Tomorrow, 1 2:00, the bus leaves.
Don't be late!

954
01:06:23,511 --> 01:06:25,570
Where the hell is Caretaker?

955
01:06:27,281 --> 01:06:28,509
I don't know.

956
01:06:56,611 --> 01:06:59,171
A gift for you, Mr. Crewe.

957
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:03,708
How does he listen
to that cracker shit?

958
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:34,595
We're here deep in the heart
of toothless country,

959
01:09:34,803 --> 01:09:37,397
coming to you from a simple
Texas high school stadium

960
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:39,836
that's been retrofitted
for the big event.

961
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:42,408
Now, when my man T ravis
tried to drag me out here, I said,

962
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:44,943
"What are you, brain-dead from
talking to too many Raider fans?

963
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:46,171
It's not going to work."

964
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:49,408
But the fact of the matter is,
this could shape up as an epic day.

965
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:52,815
Hot-dog vendors, high-powered rifles,
I love the combination.

966
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:55,513
And apparently so do the fans.

967
01:09:59,094 --> 01:10:00,652
Hey, shitheads! Listen up!

968
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,694
Everybody on their feet
for the warden.

969
01:10:07,136 --> 01:10:09,536
Anthony, wow. You can sit down.

970
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:12,097
Thank God.

971
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:16,573
Gentlemen, Texas marshals
have been kind enough

972
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:20,272
to supply us with a dozen
of their finest sharpshooters.

973
01:10:20,917 --> 01:10:24,216
So for those of you thinking
of mingling with the civilians

974
01:10:24,421 --> 01:10:26,048
or trying to make a break for it,

975
01:10:26,623 --> 01:10:28,022
you will be shot.

976
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:30,852
In the head.

977
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:37,727
Now, let's all go out there
and have some fun!

978
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:43,833
Crewe! I'll see you on the field!

979
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:48,003
I think he's in love with you.

980
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:51,070
All right, listen up.

981
01:10:51,281 --> 01:10:55,183
I know it's hard to get psyched for
the game without Caretaker being here.

982
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:58,579
But somehow that sick,
skinny bastard

983
01:10:58,788 --> 01:11:02,781
found a way to get us all fired up
from beyond the grave.

984
01:11:03,928 --> 01:11:06,396
Caretaker's last gift to us.

985
01:11:06,597 --> 01:11:09,293
Battle, I presume this is yours.

986
01:11:11,068 --> 01:11:13,229
I still don't think that's big enough.

987
01:11:15,406 --> 01:11:18,068
- That's it?
- No, that ain't it.

988
01:11:18,409 --> 01:11:20,877
Caretaker said he'd find us
some gear to wear.

989
01:11:25,116 --> 01:11:27,641
I think he found us a name too.

990
01:11:31,856 --> 01:11:35,155
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

991
01:11:48,038 --> 01:11:52,475
Good afternoon and welcome to a
very special edition of ESPN football.

992
01:11:52,676 --> 01:11:56,043
As today, the semipro
Allenville Federal Prison guards

993
01:11:56,248 --> 01:11:58,876
will be taking on the very prisoners
they guard.

994
01:11:59,084 --> 01:12:02,520
And with this special game, folks,
comes a special broadcast,

995
01:12:02,721 --> 01:12:05,986
as I'm joined in the booth
by Baby Face Bob.

996
01:12:06,191 --> 01:12:07,920
Say hi to the folks, Bob-O.

997
01:12:09,628 --> 01:12:11,323
Chris, we went to a commercial.

998
01:12:11,530 --> 01:12:14,727
This job, Bob,
it's a lot of give and take.

999
01:12:14,933 --> 01:12:17,731
So when I bring you in,
don't be afraid to talk to the folks.

1000
01:12:20,071 --> 01:12:22,039
Unless you don't want to.

1001
01:12:25,443 --> 01:12:26,967
And here come the cons,

1002
01:12:27,179 --> 01:12:31,138
Ied by former NFL MVP quarterback
Paul Crewe.

1003
01:12:36,388 --> 01:12:38,982
Holy shit. Hey, hey, hey.

1004
01:12:39,191 --> 01:12:40,818
Well, hello. How are you?

1005
01:12:41,026 --> 01:12:42,493
Back away from the girls!

1006
01:12:42,694 --> 01:12:44,821
- Hey, now.
- Call me!

1007
01:12:46,698 --> 01:12:48,495
What the hell
are you dressed up for?

1008
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:52,261
Hey, I didn't spend 14 years
in the joint just to watch this game.

1009
01:12:52,471 --> 01:12:54,268
And there in the
high-security bleachers

1010
01:12:54,473 --> 01:12:57,840
are the good-behavior cons,
along with their...

1011
01:12:58,044 --> 01:12:59,136
...cheerleaders?

1012
01:13:00,346 --> 01:13:02,371
We're the mean machine
Don't mean to dis you

1013
01:13:02,582 --> 01:13:05,176
We're gonna kick your ass
And then we'll kiss you

1014
01:13:05,585 --> 01:13:08,179
Hey! Ho!
What?

1015
01:13:11,023 --> 01:13:13,287
I didn't do it!

1016
01:13:24,337 --> 01:13:25,395
Come on, Batt!

1017
01:13:40,753 --> 01:13:42,744
- What's that?
- Did you see that?

1018
01:13:46,627 --> 01:13:47,685
Damn it!

1019
01:13:49,062 --> 01:13:52,896
Papajohn's at the 20, the 10.
And he will score.

1020
01:13:56,670 --> 01:13:58,763
Sweet dreams, bitch.

1021
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:01,066
That's a 90-yard return.

1022
01:14:01,275 --> 01:14:04,972
And I gotta tell you, the cons seem
more interested in hitting the guards

1023
01:14:05,178 --> 01:14:06,907
than tackling the ball carrier.

1024
01:14:07,114 --> 01:14:12,017
Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.
Thanks for picking me up from school.

1025
01:14:13,186 --> 01:14:15,654
And here comes the big story
of the day.

1026
01:14:15,856 --> 01:14:18,222
Paul Crewe,
serving a three-year sentence,

1027
01:14:18,425 --> 01:14:21,792
hasn't played since he was banned
from the NFL six years ago.

1028
01:14:22,162 --> 01:14:25,131
Center, shift it! Shift it!

1029
01:14:28,902 --> 01:14:30,130
Hey, Sasquatch!

1030
01:14:34,074 --> 01:14:35,166
Twenty, hut!

1031
01:14:35,375 --> 01:14:38,572
Crewe drops back to pass.
Turley's leaving him unprotected.

1032
01:14:39,747 --> 01:14:41,476
Fumble!

1033
01:14:44,452 --> 01:14:45,578
Holy shit!

1034
01:14:47,655 --> 01:14:49,020
Goddamn it.

1035
01:14:49,223 --> 01:14:51,748
That's gonna be a personal foul
on the big guy.

1036
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:54,758
And this is certainly an inauspicious
start for the cons.

1037
01:14:54,963 --> 01:14:58,262
Come here! All right! You got him.
Now, protect me!

1038
01:14:58,733 --> 01:15:00,997
Let's go! Hold them!

1039
01:15:01,703 --> 01:15:06,072
And here comes Knauer and that
big offensive unit for the guards.

1040
01:15:10,912 --> 01:15:12,072
Eighty-six.

1041
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:13,870
Back to your cell.

1042
01:15:15,383 --> 01:15:16,714
Hut! Hut!

1043
01:15:21,556 --> 01:15:25,424
Knauer has Potter wide open.
Touchdown, guards.

1044
01:15:26,861 --> 01:15:29,056
- Son of a bitch!
- And in the first 90 seconds,

1045
01:15:29,264 --> 01:15:31,459
the guards are up
by two touchdowns.

1046
01:15:31,667 --> 01:15:34,932
This one looks like
it could be over early.

1047
01:15:35,337 --> 01:15:36,634
Sorry.

1048
01:15:36,839 --> 01:15:39,740
What are we celebrating for?!
It's 1 4-nothing!

1049
01:15:39,942 --> 01:15:43,400
You guys wanna beat these assholes,
do it on the scoreboard!

1050
01:15:44,113 --> 01:15:47,776
Are you okay? Oh, God,
you're not hurt, are you?

1051
01:15:47,983 --> 01:15:49,678
Jesus, you sound like my mother.

1052
01:15:49,885 --> 01:15:54,481
Listen, if you wanna cry,
you go ahead and cry. I'll cry with you.

1053
01:15:54,690 --> 01:15:57,625
Get off me! Get back out there
and kick some ass!

1054
01:15:57,826 --> 01:16:00,920
Why are you yelling at me?
All I did was care!

1055
01:16:02,598 --> 01:16:06,295
Look! A broken leg will heal.

1056
01:16:06,502 --> 01:16:09,403
A loss to the Mean Machine
lasts forever.

1057
01:16:12,107 --> 01:16:13,074
Sorry, guys.

1058
01:16:13,642 --> 01:16:15,007
Yeah, yeah. Me too.

1059
01:16:16,745 --> 01:16:19,179
All right. Now, let's get started!

1060
01:16:21,550 --> 01:16:24,383
Now, get the hell out there! Let's go!

1061
01:16:37,767 --> 01:16:38,756
Way to go! Way to go!

1062
01:16:38,968 --> 01:16:41,698
There's the first sign of life
from the cons.

1063
01:16:41,905 --> 01:16:45,841
Let's see if Paul "Motley" Crewe
can make something happen.

1064
01:16:46,042 --> 01:16:47,009
Hut!

1065
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:51,078
On first down, Crewe will throw.
He's got Deacon wide open.

1066
01:16:52,816 --> 01:16:55,114
That's gotta be pass interference.

1067
01:16:55,318 --> 01:16:57,149
But the ref is waving it off.

1068
01:16:57,353 --> 01:16:59,412
- What?!
- Oh, come on!

1069
01:16:59,622 --> 01:17:02,090
Come on, now. I'm in this hellhole
for less than that.

1070
01:17:02,292 --> 01:17:04,988
- Be a man and make a call.
- You're right.

1071
01:17:05,195 --> 01:17:07,755
Unsportsmanlike conduct!
Eighty-eight black!

1072
01:17:07,964 --> 01:17:09,192
What?!

1073
01:17:10,166 --> 01:17:11,292
Come on!

1074
01:17:13,269 --> 01:17:14,896
This is baby-back bullshit!

1075
01:17:15,105 --> 01:17:16,902
- Bullshit, D.
- Calm down. Let it go.

1076
01:17:17,241 --> 01:17:20,142
Let's call that one
a questionable call.

1077
01:17:20,544 --> 01:17:22,068
Blue 42, hut!

1078
01:17:23,948 --> 01:17:27,611
The give is to Megget. He spins
to the outside. Megget has room.

1079
01:17:29,787 --> 01:17:32,312
He's at the 35. The 40.

1080
01:17:33,257 --> 01:17:35,316
He's brought down hard,
by his facemask.

1081
01:17:35,726 --> 01:17:38,854
What? Oh, come on, man!
That was a facemask!

1082
01:17:39,063 --> 01:17:41,190
- You're not gonna call that?
- I saw a clean tackle, sir.

1083
01:17:41,398 --> 01:17:43,332
What you looking at?
Are you serious?

1084
01:17:43,534 --> 01:17:45,695
Tell it to the parole board, criminal.

1085
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:47,965
I mean, this is absurd.

1086
01:17:48,172 --> 01:17:50,572
We can't win with the refs
on the payroll!

1087
01:17:50,774 --> 01:17:53,800
Listen up. I got an idea
to end all this bullshit.

1088
01:17:54,011 --> 01:17:56,343
Come on, let's all stay up! Come on!

1089
01:17:58,215 --> 01:17:59,648
Down, set!

1090
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:01,110
Red 58.

1091
01:18:01,318 --> 01:18:02,649
Cover your man!

1092
01:18:03,087 --> 01:18:04,987
Red 58. Hut!

1093
01:18:16,468 --> 01:18:18,959
That one hurt my marble sack.

1094
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:22,406
All right!

1095
01:18:22,607 --> 01:18:24,404
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1096
01:18:24,609 --> 01:18:26,076
- What down is it?
- Fifth.

1097
01:18:26,278 --> 01:18:28,473
- No, no. It would be fourth down.
- Okay.

1098
01:18:32,551 --> 01:18:35,748
What do you think?
Should I go for the left nut this time?

1099
01:18:36,254 --> 01:18:38,347
Underneath! Let's go!

1100
01:18:38,557 --> 01:18:40,457
Ref, you gotta get in the game!
Right over here!

1101
01:18:40,659 --> 01:18:44,891
Well, I don't quite get this, but on fourth
and 22, the cons are gonna go for it.

1102
01:18:45,096 --> 01:18:46,620
Down, set!

1103
01:18:46,831 --> 01:18:48,298
Red 58.

1104
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,024
Red 58. Hut!

1105
01:18:59,311 --> 01:19:01,836
You gotta always protect
the McNuggets.

1106
01:19:05,318 --> 01:19:08,082
How about from now on, you call
a fair game? How's that sound?

1107
01:19:08,454 --> 01:19:09,443
Sounds good.

1108
01:19:09,655 --> 01:19:11,589
Okay. Wet Willie.

1109
01:19:12,992 --> 01:19:14,357
Yeah, you like that.

1110
01:19:18,564 --> 01:19:20,361
And so the guards will take over

1111
01:19:20,566 --> 01:19:24,024
after one of the strangest
offensive series I've ever seen.

1112
01:19:24,370 --> 01:19:27,430
Okay, boys. We know who doesn't
have any balls out there now.

1113
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:30,131
Have we got any?
Have we got some balls?

1114
01:19:30,343 --> 01:19:33,870
- Yeah!
- All right! Let's go kick some ass!

1115
01:19:34,313 --> 01:19:36,941
Come on, Swit, stand them up, baby.

1116
01:19:37,149 --> 01:19:40,915
White 50. White 50. Hut, hut, hut!

1117
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,554
Knauer, play action.
Here comes the blitz.

1118
01:19:46,425 --> 01:19:50,156
Switowski is so big, it's like being
tackled by a Coke machine with legs.

1119
01:19:50,696 --> 01:19:52,288
This is fun!

1120
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,827
Nice to see you smiling, Bob.

1121
01:19:56,603 --> 01:19:58,036
Thanks, Chris.

1122
01:19:59,539 --> 01:20:01,029
Green 90! Hut!

1123
01:20:01,375 --> 01:20:03,673
Third and 5,
and the give is to Megget.

1124
01:20:03,877 --> 01:20:06,402
He's to the 40,
where he'll come up short.

1125
01:20:06,647 --> 01:20:09,241
But look at Turley push the pile.

1126
01:20:09,449 --> 01:20:10,746
And now Crewe.

1127
01:20:11,685 --> 01:20:13,414
And that's a first down!

1128
01:20:14,955 --> 01:20:18,254
And look out. Boy, somebody better
take control of this game soon,

1129
01:20:18,458 --> 01:20:20,619
or they're gonna need body bags
on the sidelines.

1130
01:20:20,827 --> 01:20:21,851
Let's go, guys.

1131
01:20:22,062 --> 01:20:23,188
Start of the second quarter.

1132
01:20:23,397 --> 01:20:26,423
Cons still down by two touchdowns,
but they finally have some momentum.

1133
01:20:26,633 --> 01:20:27,998
Hut!

1134
01:20:30,437 --> 01:20:32,632
Crewe with a shovel pass to Megget.

1135
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,670
And Megget scrambles
for a first down.

1136
01:20:36,476 --> 01:20:37,841
Oh, you fooled me.

1137
01:20:38,045 --> 01:20:39,945
- I got you there, didn't l?
- You did.

1138
01:20:40,147 --> 01:20:42,672
You know, Engleheart, you are
the best-looking guy on your team.

1139
01:20:42,883 --> 01:20:47,411
You know, Paul, in the midst of all this,
for you to say something like that is...

1140
01:20:48,322 --> 01:20:49,687
Come on, let's go. Let's go, D.

1141
01:20:49,891 --> 01:20:52,018
First and 10 at the guards' 35.

1142
01:20:52,226 --> 01:20:55,127
Crewe dumps it over the middle
to Deacon Moss.

1143
01:20:55,396 --> 01:21:00,527
And he's hammered at the 17 for a
13-yard pickup, and that's a first down.

1144
01:21:01,135 --> 01:21:02,864
- Hut!
- Crewe, trying to get his team

1145
01:21:03,071 --> 01:21:04,538
on the scoreboard.

1146
01:21:05,239 --> 01:21:06,797
He will throw.

1147
01:21:08,943 --> 01:21:11,844
And it's caught by Deacon Moss
for a touchdown!

1148
01:21:13,181 --> 01:21:14,148
All right!

1149
01:21:14,349 --> 01:21:18,342
And so there'll be no shutout today,
as the cons are on the board.

1150
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:22,185
Quit booing, people.
Both teams are trying very hard!

1151
01:21:22,623 --> 01:21:25,888
What the hell's wrong with you?
Stop acting like a damn cheerleader!

1152
01:21:26,094 --> 01:21:28,221
- Sportsmanship, try it.
- Shut up.

1153
01:21:31,799 --> 01:21:33,232
Damn.

1154
01:21:33,434 --> 01:21:36,597
2:1 1 left in the first half.
And Dunham is back in at fullback.

1155
01:21:36,804 --> 01:21:39,671
And he is a load, at 6'2", 260.

1156
01:21:42,143 --> 01:21:44,168
Dunham, breaking tackles.

1157
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:46,109
He refuses to go down.

1158
01:21:46,782 --> 01:21:50,582
But he finally does
after a 1 5-yard gain.

1159
01:21:52,121 --> 01:21:54,282
That's how a white man
runs a football.

1160
01:21:54,490 --> 01:21:57,288
If I was on D, I'd crack you square
in that egg-ass head of yours.

1161
01:21:57,493 --> 01:22:00,291
Yeah, but you ain't on D.
Are you, bitch?

1162
01:22:01,797 --> 01:22:04,095
Switowski! Come here.

1163
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,727
Do you know what
he said to me in the library?

1164
01:22:10,506 --> 01:22:13,236
Yes. Him. Out.

1165
01:22:16,712 --> 01:22:19,681
D, D, defense
D, D, defense

1166
01:22:19,882 --> 01:22:22,077
The cons don't seem to have
an answer for Dunham,

1167
01:22:22,284 --> 01:22:25,845
who's averaging close to 12 yards
a carry this half.

1168
01:22:27,489 --> 01:22:28,615
Green 67.

1169
01:22:28,824 --> 01:22:30,689
Green 67. Hut!

1170
01:22:34,596 --> 01:22:37,827
Oh, what a hit on Dunham
by Switowski.

1171
01:22:40,437 --> 01:22:42,803
I think I made him shit himself.

1172
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:45,131
- Shit!
- I think he just shit himself.

1173
01:22:45,542 --> 01:22:47,737
I think he just shit himself.

1174
01:22:47,944 --> 01:22:51,471
Good Lord.
This guy shit himself bigtime.

1175
01:22:51,681 --> 01:22:55,014
See? I told you
I made him shit himself!

1176
01:22:55,785 --> 01:22:58,652
Yo! I'll make sure I send
them books to the hospital, pimp.

1177
01:22:58,855 --> 01:23:00,516
And some diapers.

1178
01:23:02,158 --> 01:23:04,888
Nineteen seconds.
We got a lot of ground to cover.

1179
01:23:05,094 --> 01:23:07,426
So you bastards remember
that play we practiced in the mud?

1180
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:10,463
What are you talking about?
That was some schoolyard bullshit.

1181
01:23:10,667 --> 01:23:13,659
Yeah. Let's try some
schoolyard bullshit.

1182
01:23:15,572 --> 01:23:16,971
Come on, D, let's go.

1183
01:23:17,173 --> 01:23:20,074
Down, set! Green 88.

1184
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:21,741
Green 88. Hut!

1185
01:23:21,945 --> 01:23:26,678
The clock starts to run. Crewe hands
the ball to Megget. It's a reverse.

1186
01:23:26,983 --> 01:23:29,042
Cheeseburger Eddy's got it.

1187
01:23:29,252 --> 01:23:30,947
Go, baby, go!

1188
01:23:31,555 --> 01:23:33,546
He laterals to Deacon.

1189
01:23:34,758 --> 01:23:36,123
T ackle him!

1190
01:23:37,394 --> 01:23:38,588
To Turley.

1191
01:23:38,796 --> 01:23:41,458
The clock is running. To Brucie.

1192
01:23:41,665 --> 01:23:43,690
Shades of Cal-Stanford.

1193
01:23:43,901 --> 01:23:45,391
Back to Crewe.

1194
01:23:46,136 --> 01:23:47,865
He tosses to Megget.

1195
01:23:48,072 --> 01:23:49,096
T ackle him!

1196
01:23:52,977 --> 01:23:55,810
And look at that little Megget run.

1197
01:23:56,013 --> 01:23:57,742
Three seconds left.

1198
01:23:59,016 --> 01:24:00,040
Yeah! Go!

1199
01:24:01,151 --> 01:24:06,316
He could go all the way. Touchdown!

1200
01:24:11,896 --> 01:24:13,022
Did you see that?!

1201
01:24:13,230 --> 01:24:14,595
Do that sound again.

1202
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:17,897
I like that.

1203
01:24:20,971 --> 01:24:23,269
And so, on a miraculous play,

1204
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:27,411
the cons end the first half
with the score: 14-all.

1205
01:24:32,450 --> 01:24:34,179
Bring it in.

1206
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:38,253
Do you have any idea
who's beating you out there?

1207
01:24:38,456 --> 01:24:40,617
This was supposed to be a blowout,

1208
01:24:40,825 --> 01:24:44,283
and they're showing you up
in front of the whole nation.

1209
01:24:45,363 --> 01:24:46,990
The whole nation!

1210
01:24:47,399 --> 01:24:49,594
I like it when he's angry.

1211
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:54,532
- I told you!
- Way to go, baby, way to go.

1212
01:25:00,912 --> 01:25:03,779
What in the hell do you think
you're doing out there?

1213
01:25:03,982 --> 01:25:05,609
Playing football, sir.

1214
01:25:07,319 --> 01:25:09,150
I didn't say nothing about winning.

1215
01:25:09,487 --> 01:25:11,717
We're not winning. Not yet.

1216
01:25:14,826 --> 01:25:17,294
You got yourself in quite
a predicament, Mr. Crewe.

1217
01:25:17,496 --> 01:25:19,964
- Is that right?
- See, it's just come to my attention

1218
01:25:20,166 --> 01:25:22,225
that inmate Unger
has been taken into custody

1219
01:25:22,435 --> 01:25:23,902
for the murder of Caretaker.

1220
01:25:24,103 --> 01:25:26,469
- Good.
- Oh, yeah, it's good.

1221
01:25:26,939 --> 01:25:30,306
Only thing is, he claims
to have an accomplice.

1222
01:25:30,743 --> 01:25:32,506
Claims you knew all about it.

1223
01:25:32,712 --> 01:25:35,909
Hell, he even says
you sent Caretaker to your cell.

1224
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:38,277
Bullshit.

1225
01:25:38,484 --> 01:25:41,681
Captain Knauer says
he saw you planning it with Unger.

1226
01:25:43,089 --> 01:25:44,784
There's no way
that could hold up in court.

1227
01:25:44,991 --> 01:25:45,980
Court?

1228
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:52,229
Hell, boy, in Allenville,
I'm the judge, I'm the jury,

1229
01:25:52,431 --> 01:25:56,595
and in your particular case,
I'm the executioner.

1230
01:25:57,470 --> 01:25:58,494
What do you want?

1231
01:25:59,038 --> 01:26:00,665
I want you to lose.

1232
01:26:00,873 --> 01:26:02,033
I can't do that.

1233
01:26:02,241 --> 01:26:05,233
Of course you can. After all,
you've had plenty of practice.

1234
01:26:05,444 --> 01:26:08,880
But the men. It's more important
to them than it is to you.

1235
01:26:10,117 --> 01:26:12,176
Okay. Suit yourself.

1236
01:26:12,552 --> 01:26:15,988
Spend the next 25 years
of your useless life in prison.

1237
01:26:18,225 --> 01:26:19,954
All right, I'll do it.

1238
01:26:23,964 --> 01:26:27,798
But I don't want my guys hurt.
You get ahead, you coast. We clear?

1239
01:26:28,001 --> 01:26:30,697
Fine. Right after I get
a two-touchdown lead.

1240
01:26:32,272 --> 01:26:35,036
I tell you what bothers me
the most, warden.

1241
01:26:37,210 --> 01:26:39,974
That you're not gonna be
out there on that field with us,

1242
01:26:40,180 --> 01:26:42,011
getting what you got coming to you.

1243
01:26:45,118 --> 01:26:47,951
The only thing coming to me
is victory.

1244
01:26:50,123 --> 01:26:51,556
Mean Machine.

1245
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:54,388
It's cute.

1246
01:26:57,564 --> 01:26:59,293
- Let's go, boy!
- We can do it, baby!

1247
01:26:59,499 --> 01:27:00,989
Captain.

1248
01:27:01,935 --> 01:27:03,334
May I have a word?

1249
01:27:03,538 --> 01:27:06,029
Don't worry, warden,
we'll take care of business.

1250
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,366
I already have.

1251
01:27:07,809 --> 01:27:10,437
What? We can win this on our own.

1252
01:27:10,645 --> 01:27:14,706
Captain, a man in my position
doesn't leave things to chance.

1253
01:27:15,450 --> 01:27:18,578
Now, after you get a comfortable
three-touchdown lead,

1254
01:27:18,786 --> 01:27:21,619
I want you to inflict as much pain
as humanly possible.

1255
01:27:21,823 --> 01:27:24,018
Do not let up, you hear?

1256
01:27:24,392 --> 01:27:27,293
I want those cons to understand
who owns them.

1257
01:27:28,162 --> 01:27:29,459
Do I make myself clear?

1258
01:27:29,664 --> 01:27:30,961
Oh, yes, sir.

1259
01:27:31,766 --> 01:27:32,733
Good.

1260
01:27:33,634 --> 01:27:37,126
There's the kickoff, and we're
under way in the second half.

1261
01:27:42,877 --> 01:27:45,971
Megget is finally brought down
at the guards' 33,

1262
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:47,772
where Paul Crewe will take over.

1263
01:27:47,982 --> 01:27:49,779
And what a first half he's had.

1264
01:27:49,984 --> 01:27:51,246
Here we go! Here we go!

1265
01:27:54,422 --> 01:27:55,719
Down, set!

1266
01:27:56,492 --> 01:27:58,619
Y 45. Hut!

1267
01:27:59,528 --> 01:28:01,996
On first and 10, Crewe will pass.

1268
01:28:02,197 --> 01:28:03,892
- He's got Deacon wide open.
- Come on.

1269
01:28:04,099 --> 01:28:05,259
Oh, incomplete.

1270
01:28:05,467 --> 01:28:06,559
It's okay. Get your head up.

1271
01:28:07,136 --> 01:28:08,103
It's all right, man.

1272
01:28:10,105 --> 01:28:11,333
Come on, Paulie.

1273
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:14,805
Second and 10 from the 33. Crewe's
looking for Deacon once again.

1274
01:28:15,010 --> 01:28:17,171
- He's open!
- He's open!

1275
01:28:17,846 --> 01:28:21,748
But overthrows it.
And it's picked off by Papajohn.

1276
01:28:21,950 --> 01:28:23,474
Look out! He might go.

1277
01:28:25,087 --> 01:28:26,748
Say goodbye.

1278
01:28:27,523 --> 01:28:28,512
Touchdown!

1279
01:28:30,592 --> 01:28:34,153
The first mistake
Crewe's made all day.

1280
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:40,930
Short memory, baby.
We'll get it back. We'll get it back.

1281
01:28:41,136 --> 01:28:42,763
Defense, let's do this!

1282
01:28:43,972 --> 01:28:45,564
8:38 left in the third quarter,

1283
01:28:45,774 --> 01:28:47,765
and Crewe has struggled
thus far in the second half.

1284
01:28:47,976 --> 01:28:49,409
Hut!

1285
01:28:49,611 --> 01:28:53,047
The pitch to Megget.
Oh, my! That ball is live!

1286
01:28:54,083 --> 01:28:55,675
It's picked up by Lambert.

1287
01:28:55,885 --> 01:28:59,150
He's at the 1 5, the 1 0,
and he will score!

1288
01:29:00,857 --> 01:29:02,620
Yeah! T ouchdown! Yeah!

1289
01:29:02,826 --> 01:29:07,024
Crewe took a shot on that play
and he's getting up slowly.

1290
01:29:07,230 --> 01:29:10,666
Meanwhile, in the end zone, the guards
have something to celebrate,

1291
01:29:10,867 --> 01:29:13,358
as they find themselves up
by two touchdowns.

1292
01:29:13,570 --> 01:29:17,131
This is simply a different Paul Crewe
we're seeing here in the second half.

1293
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:19,831
There's the old Paul Crewe
we love to write about.

1294
01:29:20,043 --> 01:29:21,772
What the hell are you
doing out there?

1295
01:29:21,978 --> 01:29:23,468
I'm done.

1296
01:29:24,781 --> 01:29:26,248
I'm out. That's it.

1297
01:29:28,651 --> 01:29:30,414
- Where you hurting?
- My knee.

1298
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:32,645
- Seems okay to me.
- Well, it ain't.

1299
01:29:35,325 --> 01:29:39,159
If Crewe can't go, I don't know how
deep these guys are at quarterback.

1300
01:29:41,231 --> 01:29:44,667
The guards will try to keep it away
from Megget, so they'll pooch kick.

1301
01:29:44,869 --> 01:29:46,131
Fair catch. Fair catch.

1302
01:29:46,337 --> 01:29:48,931
As Big Tony calls for the fair catch.

1303
01:29:49,406 --> 01:29:53,069
Watch out. That was as late a hit
as I've ever seen.

1304
01:29:54,845 --> 01:29:58,645
And even some of the home crowd
not liking that one.

1305
01:29:58,849 --> 01:29:59,907
Hang in there, partner.

1306
01:30:00,117 --> 01:30:04,110
Can of corn. Can of corn,
and I'll be fine. Can of corn.

1307
01:30:07,224 --> 01:30:09,419
Yeah, I'd have a hard time
looking at me too.

1308
01:30:09,994 --> 01:30:11,120
Brucie.

1309
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:12,420
Yeah, coach.

1310
01:30:12,630 --> 01:30:16,088
You're the only one that knows
this offense, son. Now, do it.

1311
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:18,666
Coming into the game,
replacing the injured Paul Crewe,

1312
01:30:18,869 --> 01:30:20,200
is number 1, Brucie.

1313
01:30:20,404 --> 01:30:22,235
All right, all right.
Crewe's playing like shit.

1314
01:30:22,439 --> 01:30:24,532
That's his problem.
I'm gonna bring us back.

1315
01:30:24,742 --> 01:30:27,108
Right, 32 Flex Dive Motion
on one. Ready!

1316
01:30:27,311 --> 01:30:28,278
Break!

1317
01:30:28,479 --> 01:30:31,073
Yeah. It's Brucie's
time to shine, baby.

1318
01:30:31,649 --> 01:30:34,140
Okay. Down, set. Hut!

1319
01:30:34,351 --> 01:30:38,253
There's the snap and the ball is
fumbled. And the guards recover.

1320
01:30:38,456 --> 01:30:40,151
I knew I shouldn't
have had that popcorn.

1321
01:30:41,326 --> 01:30:45,092
The guards are in command here
as we move late into the third quarter.

1322
01:30:45,297 --> 01:30:46,662
Ninety-eight. Hut! Hut!

1323
01:30:47,666 --> 01:30:50,692
The give is to Potter.
Back to Knauer.

1324
01:30:50,902 --> 01:30:53,166
He's got a man open
deep downfield.

1325
01:30:53,371 --> 01:30:55,305
He'll throw the flea-flicker!

1326
01:30:55,507 --> 01:30:58,169
And he's got it. Touchdown, guards.

1327
01:30:58,376 --> 01:31:01,436
And this game is starting
to look like a blowout.

1328
01:31:03,515 --> 01:31:07,611
Hey, man, after all Caretaker did,
this is how you show him love?

1329
01:31:07,819 --> 01:31:09,184
Don't worry about it.

1330
01:31:09,387 --> 01:31:11,651
You haven't changed one damn bit.

1331
01:31:16,127 --> 01:31:17,856
All right. Down, set!

1332
01:31:18,063 --> 01:31:19,291
Back in at quarterback is Brucie,

1333
01:31:19,497 --> 01:31:22,330
who will try to find a handle
on the ball this time.

1334
01:31:23,501 --> 01:31:24,763
Throw it, Brucie!

1335
01:31:25,303 --> 01:31:26,770
Oh, shit!

1336
01:31:27,105 --> 01:31:28,504
And look out.

1337
01:31:32,545 --> 01:31:34,604
What a shot he took!

1338
01:31:34,914 --> 01:31:36,279
How much more blood do you want?

1339
01:31:39,452 --> 01:31:43,149
I think the cons are just about
out of options at quarterback.

1340
01:32:02,541 --> 01:32:04,668
Hey, Skitchy,
let me ask you something.

1341
01:32:05,578 --> 01:32:08,479
When you popped the warden,
was it worth it?

1342
01:32:08,681 --> 01:32:10,808
Was it worth spending
the rest of your life in here?

1343
01:32:11,517 --> 01:32:15,351
Was it worth it? It was worth
every goddamn second.

1344
01:32:23,330 --> 01:32:25,127
What the hell is he doing?

1345
01:32:28,035 --> 01:32:31,664
Paul Crewe must be feeling better,
because here he comes.

1346
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:34,238
All right, I missed you guys,
so I'm back.

1347
01:32:34,441 --> 01:32:36,705
We got a lot of work to do.
Let's get it going.

1348
01:32:36,910 --> 01:32:39,504
Deuce right, 89. Fly on two. Ready?

1349
01:32:41,848 --> 01:32:42,906
Break.

1350
01:32:44,484 --> 01:32:47,510
As we start the fourth quarter,
cons down by three touchdowns.

1351
01:32:47,721 --> 01:32:49,018
Wide left! Tight left!

1352
01:32:50,757 --> 01:32:52,782
Black 90. Hut! Hut!

1353
01:32:52,993 --> 01:32:55,553
Here comes the blitz,
and no one's blocking!

1354
01:32:55,762 --> 01:32:58,754
And Crewe will be sacked
for a big loss.

1355
01:32:59,433 --> 01:33:03,460
That looked like a message to Crewe
from his offensive line.

1356
01:33:05,138 --> 01:33:06,867
Did you see that, man?
They're quitting on him.

1357
01:33:07,074 --> 01:33:09,065
Okay, baby. Jailbreak Blitz. Ready?

1358
01:33:09,409 --> 01:33:11,536
We got that out of the way.
I deserved it.

1359
01:33:11,745 --> 01:33:14,111
- Now we gotta play some football.
- Switch it! Switch it!

1360
01:33:14,314 --> 01:33:16,407
Cons need to do something
to get back in this game.

1361
01:33:16,616 --> 01:33:18,447
And that's not it!

1362
01:33:19,253 --> 01:33:21,244
And Crewe is leveled!

1363
01:33:21,456 --> 01:33:23,754
I don't think he's gonna get up
from that one.

1364
01:33:23,958 --> 01:33:25,425
Nice hit!

1365
01:33:27,328 --> 01:33:29,922
But he is. And I don't know how,
after that last hit.

1366
01:33:30,131 --> 01:33:31,257
All right, punt team!

1367
01:33:31,466 --> 01:33:33,832
Keep them off the field!
We're going for it.

1368
01:33:34,035 --> 01:33:35,900
Dumbshits are going for it!
Let's go! Let's go!

1369
01:33:36,270 --> 01:33:39,205
Come on back, if he wants to get
his ass kicked. Come on back.

1370
01:33:39,407 --> 01:33:40,669
This is unbelievable.

1371
01:33:40,875 --> 01:33:45,039
Fine. You guys don't wanna help me,
I'll do it on my own. On two.

1372
01:33:46,047 --> 01:33:47,275
Let's go, to the line.

1373
01:33:47,482 --> 01:33:48,813
On fourth and 20,

1374
01:33:49,016 --> 01:33:51,814
the cons are gonna go for it.
This could be the ball game right here.

1375
01:33:52,019 --> 01:33:54,078
Red 98. Hut! Hut!

1376
01:33:55,690 --> 01:33:59,387
Crewe dodges the blitz,
but he loses his helmet.

1377
01:34:02,864 --> 01:34:04,388
And he's not going down.

1378
01:34:10,004 --> 01:34:12,268
He's got the first down.

1379
01:34:12,474 --> 01:34:13,702
Time-out!

1380
01:34:14,409 --> 01:34:16,070
- Man, oh, man.
- Not bad.

1381
01:34:23,652 --> 01:34:24,880
Huddle up.

1382
01:34:25,988 --> 01:34:26,977
Look.

1383
01:34:28,090 --> 01:34:31,548
I'm sure you already know this,
but I never said it out loud.

1384
01:34:33,028 --> 01:34:34,791
I did throw that game.

1385
01:34:36,231 --> 01:34:37,528
I did it.

1386
01:34:38,367 --> 01:34:41,200
I was in a bad way
with some worse people.

1387
01:34:42,037 --> 01:34:43,368
After I did it,

1388
01:34:43,572 --> 01:34:47,599
I felt so shitty I wish I would have
just let them kill me instead.

1389
01:34:48,277 --> 01:34:52,646
Now the warden wants to pin
Caretaker's murder on me

1390
01:34:52,848 --> 01:34:54,782
if I don't throw this game.

1391
01:34:56,618 --> 01:34:59,086
So it looks like I'm gonna get
to know you guys a lot better,

1392
01:34:59,288 --> 01:35:01,916
because I ain't doing that
twice in a lifetime.

1393
01:35:02,124 --> 01:35:05,321
We got a little time left.
We can still do this.

1394
01:35:05,528 --> 01:35:08,622
I'm begging you.
Put your hands in here.

1395
01:35:18,374 --> 01:35:21,434
Okay. Thank you. Now, who are we?

1396
01:35:21,644 --> 01:35:22,668
Mean Machine!

1397
01:35:22,879 --> 01:35:25,245
Come on, Mean Machine, let's go!

1398
01:35:28,585 --> 01:35:29,847
That's great news.

1399
01:35:30,053 --> 01:35:32,817
All right. We got ourselves a game.

1400
01:35:33,022 --> 01:35:34,614
Brown 65. Hut!

1401
01:35:34,824 --> 01:35:38,885
First and 10 from the 30.
Crewe finds Deacon open in the flat.

1402
01:35:40,997 --> 01:35:41,964
Hut!

1403
01:35:43,666 --> 01:35:46,533
The give is to Megget. And he fights
his way for a 9-yard gain.

1404
01:35:46,736 --> 01:35:48,431
One yard, baby. One more yard.

1405
01:35:49,839 --> 01:35:50,863
Hut! Hut!

1406
01:35:51,074 --> 01:35:53,065
Crewe tries a sneak. Or is it?

1407
01:35:53,276 --> 01:35:54,743
He flips it back to Megget.

1408
01:35:55,245 --> 01:35:58,271
Megget's got the first down
and more.

1409
01:36:05,656 --> 01:36:09,615
And Megget is down to the 4-yard
line, where it'll be first and goal.

1410
01:36:09,827 --> 01:36:10,919
Hut!

1411
01:36:11,962 --> 01:36:15,591
Crewe hands it to Turley.
And look at the big man go.

1412
01:36:15,799 --> 01:36:17,027
T ackle him!

1413
01:36:22,773 --> 01:36:23,831
Touchdown!

1414
01:36:24,942 --> 01:36:29,174
That was some rumbling, bumbling
stumbling right there.

1415
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:31,143
And listen to the crowd

1416
01:36:31,348 --> 01:36:35,011
as this underdog con team
is starting to win them over.

1417
01:36:43,093 --> 01:36:46,688
Third down and 6. Guards have
the ball on their own 29-yard line.

1418
01:36:46,897 --> 01:36:49,365
Knauer needs a first down
to put this game away.

1419
01:36:49,566 --> 01:36:51,033
White 50!

1420
01:36:51,636 --> 01:36:52,694
White 50!

1421
01:36:52,904 --> 01:36:55,065
And look at Battle take off.

1422
01:36:56,474 --> 01:36:57,941
He knocks the ball loose!

1423
01:36:59,210 --> 01:37:03,772
There's a dogpile in the backfield.
The refs are trying to sort it out.

1424
01:37:06,484 --> 01:37:08,111
My arm!

1425
01:37:08,987 --> 01:37:11,080
The cons recover!

1426
01:37:11,723 --> 01:37:14,556
We got the ball! We got the ball!
We got it! We got it!

1427
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:19,797
With just over two minutes left to be
played, this has turned into a game.

1428
01:37:20,165 --> 01:37:23,896
Crewe will start in great field position
at the guards' 25.

1429
01:37:24,102 --> 01:37:27,697
And look at this formation.
The guards, they're confused.

1430
01:37:27,906 --> 01:37:28,964
Shift over! Move!

1431
01:37:29,174 --> 01:37:31,438
They're trying to call time-out,
but there's the snap.

1432
01:37:35,313 --> 01:37:38,840
Moss is behind a wall of cons. I
wouldn't wanna be in front of that thing.

1433
01:37:42,087 --> 01:37:43,486
And they'll score!

1434
01:37:48,661 --> 01:37:51,255
- Hey! Is that legal?
- Yeah, it is.

1435
01:37:51,464 --> 01:37:53,295
- Is that a touchdown?
- Yes, it is.

1436
01:37:53,499 --> 01:37:56,366
What is going on here? Shit!

1437
01:37:56,869 --> 01:38:00,066
And with the extra point,
the cons are down by just seven.

1438
01:38:07,546 --> 01:38:09,844
- Brucie!
- Yeah. Yeah, coach.

1439
01:38:10,383 --> 01:38:12,408
I want you to go out there
and kick off.

1440
01:38:12,618 --> 01:38:14,518
- I can do it.
- Kick off!

1441
01:38:14,954 --> 01:38:16,751
Brucie can't kick worth a shit.

1442
01:38:16,956 --> 01:38:19,754
I know. Recover the ball.

1443
01:38:20,159 --> 01:38:23,026
Jesus Christ, my savior.
If you help me out with this one,

1444
01:38:23,229 --> 01:38:26,721
I promise to stop cheating on my wife
with black guys. Amen.

1445
01:38:26,932 --> 01:38:29,093
Back in the game is Brucie,
and he'll do the honors.

1446
01:38:29,301 --> 01:38:30,893
And it's a horrible kick.

1447
01:38:31,103 --> 01:38:32,593
But the ball is tipped!

1448
01:38:33,506 --> 01:38:36,031
And the cons have come up with it!

1449
01:38:37,277 --> 01:38:39,745
- We got it! One time-out.
- Got it. Got it.

1450
01:38:39,946 --> 01:38:43,382
That's it, Brucie. Hey, hey!
My bad. My bad. My bad. Come on.

1451
01:38:44,785 --> 01:38:46,275
Give me that.

1452
01:38:47,254 --> 01:38:48,312
Damn--

1453
01:38:49,823 --> 01:38:52,087
Well, that felt unnecessary.

1454
01:38:52,292 --> 01:38:55,056
Cons have enough time
for one final drive.

1455
01:38:56,163 --> 01:38:58,461
Crewe drops back to pass.
He's under pressure.

1456
01:38:58,698 --> 01:39:01,292
- Watch the pass!
- He's looking for Deacon.

1457
01:39:01,501 --> 01:39:03,230
He gets the ball up, but he's leveled.

1458
01:39:04,237 --> 01:39:07,035
And Deacon's got it for a first down,
but he stayed inbounds.

1459
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:09,174
Tick, tick, tick.
The clock keeps running.

1460
01:39:09,376 --> 01:39:12,368
Clock's running. Clock's still running!
Clock's still running!

1461
01:39:12,579 --> 01:39:13,568
On the ball!

1462
01:39:13,780 --> 01:39:15,771
Goddamn it! Do something!

1463
01:39:15,982 --> 01:39:17,006
Hut!

1464
01:39:17,851 --> 01:39:21,048
Crewe. He's looking to throw.
Under pressure again.

1465
01:39:21,254 --> 01:39:23,722
Go! Get rid of it! Go! Go!

1466
01:39:23,924 --> 01:39:26,119
He pitches it to Megget.
He's got some room.

1467
01:39:26,326 --> 01:39:28,954
Here we go. Here we go.
Go, Megg! Go, Megget!

1468
01:39:29,463 --> 01:39:31,988
- Go, Megget!
- Get him!

1469
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:34,600
He could go all the way!

1470
01:39:34,802 --> 01:39:36,030
But he won't!

1471
01:39:36,237 --> 01:39:37,329
Goddamn it!

1472
01:39:37,538 --> 01:39:39,972
And Megget is hit hard
at the 4, and he's hurt.

1473
01:39:40,174 --> 01:39:41,539
My knee, man!

1474
01:39:43,878 --> 01:39:46,711
You busted your knee for us,
we'll bust our ass for you.

1475
01:39:46,914 --> 01:39:48,711
Hey, coach, I need a back!

1476
01:39:48,916 --> 01:39:50,213
Just win this shit.

1477
01:39:52,253 --> 01:39:53,584
I'm going in.

1478
01:39:53,788 --> 01:39:55,380
Coach, you serious?

1479
01:39:55,590 --> 01:39:57,148
Yeah, I'm serious.

1480
01:39:57,425 --> 01:39:59,916
And look who's
coming into the game.

1481
01:40:00,528 --> 01:40:02,223
You can do it!

1482
01:40:02,430 --> 01:40:05,627
Get that old ass of yours
in the end zone!

1483
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:08,324
We gotta win this thing! Come on!

1484
01:40:10,104 --> 01:40:12,868
No, no, no. Hey, old man.

1485
01:40:13,074 --> 01:40:15,065
Absolutely not.
You're gonna get killed out here.

1486
01:40:15,276 --> 01:40:18,245
They've been trying that for years.
Don't worry, I got the perfect play.

1487
01:40:18,446 --> 01:40:20,676
- I ain't handing you the ball.
- You don't have to.

1488
01:40:20,882 --> 01:40:24,318
Nate Scarborough, the former
Heisman Trophy winner from 1955,

1489
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:25,714
is gonna play tailback,

1490
01:40:25,921 --> 01:40:28,481
but he's gotta be in there more
for moral support than anything.

1491
01:40:28,690 --> 01:40:31,488
Mean Machine. Mean Machine.

1492
01:40:31,693 --> 01:40:34,457
Mean Machine. Mean Machine.

1493
01:40:34,663 --> 01:40:38,997
Mean Machine, Mean Machine
Mean Machine

1494
01:40:39,201 --> 01:40:40,566
Mean Machine!

1495
01:40:40,769 --> 01:40:41,861
Mean Machine!

1496
01:40:42,905 --> 01:40:45,567
Six seconds left on the clock.
Cons down by seven.

1497
01:40:45,774 --> 01:40:47,765
They must score on this play.

1498
01:40:50,245 --> 01:40:51,507
Don't let them through!

1499
01:40:53,515 --> 01:40:54,880
Down, set!

1500
01:40:55,417 --> 01:40:58,045
- Black 99!
- Come on, D!

1501
01:40:58,253 --> 01:41:00,255
Black 99! Hut! Hut!

1502
01:41:00,255 --> 01:41:01,222
Black 99! Hut! Hut!

1503
01:41:01,823 --> 01:41:03,620
The give is to the big man, Turley.

1504
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:07,617
He's stopped by Lambert
at the line for no gain.

1505
01:41:08,263 --> 01:41:09,855
No! Wait!

1506
01:41:10,832 --> 01:41:13,630
The ball's picked up
by Scarborough.

1507
01:41:16,471 --> 01:41:18,132
Come on!

1508
01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:25,309
Touchdown!

1509
01:41:33,890 --> 01:41:35,721
What an amazing comeback, folks!

1510
01:41:35,925 --> 01:41:38,553
Taking a play from
the old Nebraska playbook.

1511
01:41:38,761 --> 01:41:39,750
The Fumblerooskie.

1512
01:41:39,963 --> 01:41:41,555
Easy. Easy.

1513
01:41:41,764 --> 01:41:43,231
You still alive, old man?

1514
01:41:44,767 --> 01:41:46,291
Never felt better in my life.

1515
01:41:46,502 --> 01:41:48,629
You're a sick bastard. Come here.

1516
01:41:49,372 --> 01:41:50,896
All right.

1517
01:41:51,107 --> 01:41:55,339
And now the cons are a mere
extra point away from overtime.

1518
01:41:55,545 --> 01:41:56,978
Mean Machine!

1519
01:42:00,483 --> 01:42:03,850
Team vote: We go for the win?
We go for the tie?

1520
01:42:04,053 --> 01:42:07,420
Hell, guys, we're convicts.
We always go for it all.

1521
01:42:07,957 --> 01:42:11,757
Unfortunately, that's why
we're all in the joint.

1522
01:42:12,196 --> 01:42:13,424
What would Caretaker do?

1523
01:42:15,232 --> 01:42:16,529
Give me that blackboard.

1524
01:42:16,867 --> 01:42:17,925
Yeah, come on!

1525
01:42:18,669 --> 01:42:19,636
Come on.

1526
01:42:22,172 --> 01:42:23,332
Are you serious?

1527
01:42:23,540 --> 01:42:25,201
I don't know. That play is wack.

1528
01:42:25,409 --> 01:42:26,467
It's gonna work.

1529
01:42:27,745 --> 01:42:29,940
It's gonna work. Let's go. On the ball.

1530
01:42:30,147 --> 01:42:31,136
Come on! Let's go!

1531
01:42:31,348 --> 01:42:33,339
Let's go, y'all! Let's go!

1532
01:42:33,550 --> 01:42:35,177
I think it's gonna work.

1533
01:42:36,286 --> 01:42:38,015
Get them out there.

1534
01:42:40,591 --> 01:42:43,651
And wait a minute.
Crewe is coming back into the game.

1535
01:42:43,861 --> 01:42:45,658
The cons are gonna go for the win.

1536
01:42:45,863 --> 01:42:46,921
They're going for it.

1537
01:42:48,198 --> 01:42:51,292
Crewe, trying to settle his team
into formation.

1538
01:42:51,502 --> 01:42:53,402
But there seems to be
a lot of confusion.

1539
01:42:53,604 --> 01:42:55,299
Come on! Run the play!

1540
01:42:55,506 --> 01:42:57,838
Turley! Turley. Over here.

1541
01:42:58,042 --> 01:43:00,636
Move your giant ass right here!
Right here.

1542
01:43:00,844 --> 01:43:02,641
Come on, baby. Come on.

1543
01:43:04,049 --> 01:43:07,280
The play clock is still running.
Crewe better call a time-out.

1544
01:43:07,485 --> 01:43:08,452
Come on, Crewe!

1545
01:43:10,455 --> 01:43:12,286
They don't know what we're doing!

1546
01:43:12,490 --> 01:43:14,048
Run the play we set up.

1547
01:43:14,259 --> 01:43:16,523
I think you're still dizzy from that hit!

1548
01:43:17,529 --> 01:43:19,497
The snap is to Deacon.

1549
01:43:19,698 --> 01:43:21,029
It's a trick.

1550
01:43:21,232 --> 01:43:23,257
He throws it to Crewe.

1551
01:43:46,791 --> 01:43:48,986
They did it! Unbelievable!

1552
01:43:49,194 --> 01:43:50,661
The cons win!

1553
01:44:04,243 --> 01:44:05,574
We win!

1554
01:44:05,778 --> 01:44:08,679
Group hug in the shower tonight!

1555
01:44:10,716 --> 01:44:12,946
Or not. Or not.

1556
01:44:15,054 --> 01:44:16,351
Well, there you have it.

1557
01:44:16,555 --> 01:44:18,750
A bunch of ruthless criminals
have beaten

1558
01:44:18,958 --> 01:44:21,518
the men that uphold
our justice system.

1559
01:44:21,727 --> 01:44:23,695
Criminals are people too, Chris.

1560
01:44:23,896 --> 01:44:25,227
Now, give me your wallet.

1561
01:44:25,831 --> 01:44:26,820
What?

1562
01:44:27,299 --> 01:44:28,960
Just kidding.

1563
01:44:33,072 --> 01:44:36,838
You got a lot of balls, Crewe.
You played a hell of a game.

1564
01:44:37,042 --> 01:44:40,876
And don't worry, I know you had
nothing to do with Caretaker's murder.

1565
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:42,172
And I'll back that up.

1566
01:44:43,983 --> 01:44:45,382
Thank you, baby.

1567
01:44:47,052 --> 01:44:49,577
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

1568
01:44:52,659 --> 01:44:57,187
You humiliated me. I can't believe
you couldn't even win a fixed game.

1569
01:44:59,766 --> 01:45:02,234
Now, where the hell
does he think he's going?

1570
01:45:05,739 --> 01:45:06,933
He's escaping.

1571
01:45:07,340 --> 01:45:08,466
He's escaping.

1572
01:45:08,675 --> 01:45:10,768
Officer, shoot that man!

1573
01:45:10,977 --> 01:45:12,774
But, sir, there's people.

1574
01:45:14,514 --> 01:45:15,572
Shoot him.

1575
01:45:16,550 --> 01:45:17,574
Crewe!

1576
01:45:18,285 --> 01:45:20,879
Captain, I order you
to shoot that prisoner.

1577
01:45:24,157 --> 01:45:26,182
Shoot him! Fire!

1578
01:45:26,393 --> 01:45:27,724
Crewe!

1579
01:45:27,928 --> 01:45:30,863
Damn it, I'm giving you an order,
captain!

1580
01:45:31,064 --> 01:45:32,031
Crewe!

1581
01:45:32,232 --> 01:45:34,029
Pull the trigger!

1582
01:45:53,387 --> 01:45:55,651
It's the game ball.

1583
01:46:02,597 --> 01:46:03,689
Hey.

1584
01:46:07,602 --> 01:46:10,537
Why don't you stick this
in your trophy case.

1585
01:46:12,607 --> 01:46:14,837
- You have a nice time, old man?
- Yeah.

1586
01:46:15,042 --> 01:46:17,909
Yeah? Okay.
So, what do we do now?

1587
01:46:18,112 --> 01:46:20,740
Well, the first thing is, we tell the
team where they're hiding Unger.

1588
01:46:20,948 --> 01:46:24,384
Oh, I can't wait to see
what Switowski does to him.

1589
01:46:31,259 --> 01:46:32,749
Great game, sir.

1590
01:46:35,630 --> 01:46:37,120
That's a week in the hotbox!

1591
01:46:37,332 --> 01:46:39,197
Who gives a shit?

1592
01:46:40,009 --> 01:46:48,009
