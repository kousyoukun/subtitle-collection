1
00:01:29,711 --> 00:01:30,856
Hey, sexy.

2
00:01:31,087 --> 00:01:32,429
I love that dress.

3
00:01:32,655 --> 00:01:35,470
Of course you do, Lorenzo.
You made it.

4
00:01:35,792 --> 00:01:38,093
-Hi, sweetie.
-Hey, guys.

5
00:01:39,823 --> 00:01:41,711
-There you are.
-Lena.

6
00:01:42,287 --> 00:01:44,524
-You've done it again.
-Well, it's all for you, Bradlee.

7
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:45,996
Gotta mingle.

8
00:01:46,223 --> 00:01:47,849
Oh, the girls are by the pool.

9
00:01:48,047 --> 00:01:52,554
Well, well, well, Lena. So where's
this sexy boy toy of yours hiding?

10
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:54,475
I didn't know you were
a football fan, Patrick.

11
00:01:54,671 --> 00:01:58,184
I've never watched a game. I'm just
a big fan of his old underwear ads.

12
00:01:58,511 --> 00:02:02,089
Well, he's probably just getting out of
the shower. Let me go hurry his ass up.

13
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:03,432
-Hi.
-Hey, babe.

14
00:02:05,872 --> 00:02:09,647
<i>Start of the fourth quarter, and Owens</i>
<i>will throw. He's got Brown wide open!</i>

15
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:11,944
You have got to be kidding me.

16
00:02:12,143 --> 00:02:15,045
Honey, just let me finish the game,
I'll take you to the movies.

17
00:02:15,408 --> 00:02:17,033
Take me to the movies?

18
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:20,427
Hello! There's a huge party
going on downstairs.

19
00:02:20,624 --> 00:02:22,762
Remember the catering trucks
and the valet parkers?

20
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,846
Oh, shit, I forgot.

21
00:02:25,935 --> 00:02:27,822
I'll tell you what
you should forget about.

22
00:02:29,423 --> 00:02:30,405
Football.

23
00:02:30,607 --> 00:02:32,811
Because it's forgotten all about you.

24
00:02:33,712 --> 00:02:36,461
Now, you're going to put this outfit on
that I bought you,

25
00:02:36,655 --> 00:02:39,306
drag your drunken ass downstairs

26
00:02:39,503 --> 00:02:43,497
and mingle with my clients
like a good boy.

27
00:02:44,016 --> 00:02:46,437
Who am I? Elton John?
I ain't wearing that shit.

28
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,706
-Yes, you are.
-I'm not your trained monkey, honey.

29
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,903
No. You're much more
expensive than that.

30
00:02:53,391 --> 00:02:54,635
But I tell you what.

31
00:02:54,832 --> 00:02:57,450
If you're not downstairs
in five minutes,

32
00:02:57,648 --> 00:02:59,557
I'm gonna throw you out of my bed,

33
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:02,726
out of my house and out of my life.

34
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:05,610
Then you're gonna have to
pay for your own bananas.

35
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,894
I'm just so mad at you
because you're not wearing my gift.

36
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,650
Gift?

37
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,127
What gift?

38
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,029
It's like a I-love-you gift.
I left it in the closet for you.

39
00:03:18,735 --> 00:03:19,880
Really?

40
00:03:20,175 --> 00:03:21,866
Paul, I'm so excited.

41
00:03:22,064 --> 00:03:23,624
I can't believe you did this.

42
00:03:23,824 --> 00:03:26,541
-Where'd you put it?
-In the back, on the right.

43
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,225
Paul? Paul, what are you doing?

44
00:03:29,423 --> 00:03:31,463
I think we need some
alone time, honey,

45
00:03:31,664 --> 00:03:34,381
so I'm gonna go take a cruise
in your Bentley.

46
00:03:34,575 --> 00:03:37,707
Don't you dare take my car,
you drunken bastard!

47
00:03:37,903 --> 00:03:40,773
-I own you!
-I love you.

48
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:03,977
Somebody please open
this damn door! Patrick?

49
00:04:04,175 --> 00:04:06,412
-Lena?
-Patrick.

50
00:04:07,343 --> 00:04:08,619
What happened to you?

51
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,597
He locked me in the closet
and left me to die.

52
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,995
Oh, my God, he is deranged!

53
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:16,428
He thinks he can mess with me.

54
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:17,551
<i>911.</i>

55
00:04:21,232 --> 00:04:25,029
Oh, man.
Here come the party poopers.

56
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,680
Well, well, well. I'll be damned.
If it isn't Paul Crewe.

57
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:39,465
So, what did I do wrong?
Was I driving poorly?

58
00:04:39,824 --> 00:04:42,028
Nope. Nope.
This car was reported stolen.

59
00:04:42,223 --> 00:04:45,518
No, no, no.
It's actually my girlfriend's car.

60
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,141
Shit happens.

61
00:04:47,535 --> 00:04:50,470
Shit does happen. I mean,
look what happened to your ears.

62
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:55,468
I gotta ask you something.
Does he get XM Radio with those?

63
00:04:56,144 --> 00:04:58,729
Actually, they get
a couple of channels.

64
00:05:01,071 --> 00:05:02,184
It's Paul Crewe.

65
00:05:02,383 --> 00:05:03,627
Another question, though.

66
00:05:03,824 --> 00:05:05,678
Santa Claus. What's he like?

67
00:05:07,247 --> 00:05:09,703
Boy, I hate to arrest a public figure
like yourself,

68
00:05:09,903 --> 00:05:11,790
but, hell, I don't think
you got too many

69
00:05:11,983 --> 00:05:14,252
endorsement deals to worry about,
now, do you?

70
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,065
Now, listen here, Mr. Frodo.
Don't get short with me.

71
00:05:19,951 --> 00:05:22,090
That was good. I mean, he's good.

72
00:05:23,151 --> 00:05:25,769
Man. I hope you got a lot of money
for that game you threw,

73
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:28,138
because that was the most pathetic
thing I ever saw.

74
00:05:29,071 --> 00:05:30,380
Now, step out of the vehicle,
Mr. Crewe.

75
00:05:30,575 --> 00:05:34,121
Don't you think I should pull the car
over more? I could get sideswiped.

76
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,167
You're slurring your words a bit there,
Paul. You been drinking tonight?

77
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:41,582
Absolutely not. Now, could you do me a
favor? Hold this beer while I back it up.

78
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:50,922
Hey, you can finish that one.
I got five more. Take care, guys.

79
00:05:52,591 --> 00:05:54,598
We got a 3-94 in progress.

80
00:06:12,687 --> 00:06:14,378
Okay, remain calm.

81
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:18,470
How you doing? What's up?
What's up? What's up?

82
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:25,545
<i>What you are watching is live footage</i>

90
00:06:45,391 --> 00:06:47,082
Yeah!

91
00:06:52,655 --> 00:06:54,794
-Hello.
-Do not get one more scratch

92
00:06:54,991 --> 00:06:57,412
on my car, or I will slit your throat.

93
00:06:59,855 --> 00:07:01,513
See, that's our problem, sweetie.

94
00:07:01,711 --> 00:07:04,198
You care about this car
more than you do us.

95
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,985
And how'd you even know
there was a scratch on this baby?

96
00:07:07,183 --> 00:07:11,012
Because I am watching you on TV,
as is the whole country.

97
00:07:11,215 --> 00:07:12,906
Once again,
you are proving to everyone

98
00:07:13,103 --> 00:07:15,492
what a worthless piece of shit
you are.

99
00:07:18,095 --> 00:07:19,655
Well, I hope they like this.

100
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:41,156

<i>I think we should start</i>

102
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:49,381
I think I'm in love.

103
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:54,253
Good news, boys,
I didn't spill my beer.

104
00:07:55,055 --> 00:07:58,351
<i>Without question, Crewe's five-year</i>
<i>federal probation for point-shaving</i>

<i>has been severely violated tonight. </i>

<i>The future of this once-great football</i>

Long way from the big city,
huh, superstar?

108
00:08:31,503 --> 00:08:34,023
Staying with the times
around here, huh?

109
00:08:39,503 --> 00:08:41,707
Ain't she beautiful?

110
00:08:59,407 --> 00:09:01,163
Home sweet home, boy.

111
00:09:01,359 --> 00:09:02,603
Get on your feet.

112
00:09:06,575 --> 00:09:08,582
You're one lucky son of a bitch,
Crewe.

113
00:09:08,783 --> 00:09:10,725
-Is that right?
-That's right.

114
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:13,131
See, the warden loves his football.

115
00:09:13,327 --> 00:09:16,261
Fact, he was on the winning side
of your little thing.

116
00:09:16,463 --> 00:09:19,310
-Well, tell him congratulations.
-But I wasn't.

117
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:23,114
Welcome to Allenville.

118
00:09:23,503 --> 00:09:26,186
Thank you, sergeant.
I'll take it from here.

119
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:31,341
-Afternoon, inmate Crewe.
-Yeah.

120
00:09:31,535 --> 00:09:33,477
Come on. Warden wants to see you.

121
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:35,077
Let's do it.

122
00:09:35,535 --> 00:09:36,517
Move it.

123
00:09:58,863 --> 00:10:00,651
I used to play
a little college ball myself.

124
00:10:00,847 --> 00:10:02,734
Down at the University of Miami.

125
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:05,229
I bet a lot of your old teammates
are locked up in here.

126
00:10:05,423 --> 00:10:08,718
No inmates from my playing days.
Couple of guards, though.

127
00:10:08,911 --> 00:10:11,594
See, we got us a fine
prison-guard league down here.

128
00:10:12,783 --> 00:10:15,369
It's like a company softball team.

129
00:10:16,143 --> 00:10:17,703
Now, the warden...

130
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:20,554
...he's gonna ask you to help out.

131
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:22,278
Okay. With what?

132
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:29,957
That wasn't nice.

133
00:10:32,623 --> 00:10:34,510
When the warden asks you,

134
00:10:34,703 --> 00:10:35,913
what are you gonna say?

135
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,600
Yes?

136
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,676
You're gonna tell him "no. "
You got it?

137
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:51,460
You're gonna tell the warden

138
00:10:51,663 --> 00:10:54,827
that you want nothing to do
with his football fantasies.

139
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:57,710
Not in my back yard.

140
00:10:59,087 --> 00:11:02,916
Because the warden
don't run this prison. I do.

141
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:04,199
You understand?

142
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:06,030
Not entirely.

143
00:11:10,223 --> 00:11:14,314
Okay. I feel you, dog. I feel you.

144
00:11:16,462 --> 00:11:18,983
Paul "Wrecking" Crewe.

145
00:11:19,183 --> 00:11:21,071
I don't get to say this
to my new guests very often,

146
00:11:21,262 --> 00:11:23,651
but it's an honor to have you
here at this institution.

147
00:11:23,855 --> 00:11:26,059
It's an honor to be
locked up here, sir.

148
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:29,836
Oh, well, this is Errol Dandridge.

149
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,480
Colonel Sanders
been eating his own chicken.

150
00:11:34,383 --> 00:11:36,205
He's my political adviser.

151
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,181
See, I've been approached
by several very influential people

152
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:42,539
wondering if I'd be interested
in standing for governor.

153
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:47,077
They see the way I run this prison,
think maybe I should run this state.

154
00:11:47,438 --> 00:11:49,805
Only with less sodomy, right?

155
00:11:54,862 --> 00:11:56,423
Hopefully none.

156
00:11:57,199 --> 00:11:58,126
Sorry.

157
00:12:00,111 --> 00:12:03,559
Now, there are two things we take very
seriously here in the state of Texas.

158
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,731
Prison and football.

159
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,747
We play a little of the latter here.

160
00:12:08,943 --> 00:12:13,100
The warden is too modest to admit
that his team is rather good.

161
00:12:13,391 --> 00:12:14,820
But not good enough.

162
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:18,252
Five years since
our last championship.

163
00:12:18,703 --> 00:12:19,914
Five years.

164
00:12:20,111 --> 00:12:23,046
Now, I've worked real hard,
pulled strings,

165
00:12:23,247 --> 00:12:25,516
called in quite a few favors
to get you here, Paul.

166
00:12:26,798 --> 00:12:28,489
Now, why would you go and do that?

167
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:31,982
Because I am convinced that
you can get us back on track.

168
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:38,440
I haven't played football in I don't
know how long. I don't really want to.

169
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,868
You wouldn't be playing, Paul.
Just consulting.

170
00:12:42,063 --> 00:12:44,550
Anyone who was once the MVP
of the National Football League

171
00:12:44,751 --> 00:12:47,238
must have a great deal
of expertise to offer.

172
00:12:47,727 --> 00:12:51,043
Captain, what would you say
to Mr. Crewe looking in,

173
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:53,613
giving us the benefit
of his experience?

174
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:57,898
I think that's a real good idea, warden.
We can use all the help we can get.

175
00:12:58,671 --> 00:13:00,810
Well, then, it's all settled.

176
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:02,310
What you say, Paul?

177
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:06,442
I appreciate the offer,
but I'm gonna have to pass.

178
00:13:10,702 --> 00:13:13,091
Now, I can assure you

179
00:13:13,295 --> 00:13:17,223
that your time here will be a whole
lot easier if you just participate.

180
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:22,599
I just wanna do my time
and go home. Nothing else.

181
00:13:25,903 --> 00:13:28,107
If you'll excuse us, Mr. Crewe.

182
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,663
Captain Knauer, you can stay.

183
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:36,301
Sit down!

184
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:42,595
I used to love
your underwear commercials.

185
00:13:43,535 --> 00:13:44,779
Thank you very much.

186
00:13:44,975 --> 00:13:49,001
My ex-husband wore the
same brand of tighty whities.

187
00:13:50,318 --> 00:13:53,963
He didn't fill them out
quite as well as you, though.

188
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:57,795
Special effects. Hollywood.
Not all me.

189
00:13:57,998 --> 00:14:00,998
Oh, I doubt that very seriously.

190
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,046
Well, then get him enthusiastic,
damn it!

191
00:14:04,814 --> 00:14:06,058
Come on, get up.

192
00:14:06,255 --> 00:14:08,197
How'd it go in there?
We all set now?

193
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,188
Oh, yeah, we're real tight.

194
00:14:22,415 --> 00:14:25,414
Only the finest for you, superstar.

195
00:14:30,126 --> 00:14:31,555
I was just playing.

196
00:14:37,358 --> 00:14:38,635
I ain't gonna forget you, Crewe.

197
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,838
Hey, yo, you owe me money
on that game, punk!

198
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,632
Better watch yourself, Mr. Football!

199
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:43,976
Bitch!

200
00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:52,206
Yeah, you better run, woman.

201
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:56,428
Yo, football.

202
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,475
Take a seat.

203
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,452
Thanks.

204
00:15:00,654 --> 00:15:03,371
You know, I have never seen
one inmate just walk in here

205
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:06,534
and be unanimously hated
by the entire population.

206
00:15:06,735 --> 00:15:08,971
-I ain't never seen it.
-How'd I get so lucky?

207
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:10,955
You could have robbed banks,
sold crack,

208
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:13,573
stole your grandmama's pension,
and nobody would have cared.

209
00:15:13,775 --> 00:15:17,124
But shaving points off a football game?
Man, that's just un-American.

210
00:15:17,326 --> 00:15:19,431
-You play football?
-Me? No.

211
00:15:19,631 --> 00:15:22,533
I suck so bad, they used to pick me
after the white kids.

212
00:15:22,734 --> 00:15:26,313
Used to be mad too. It's like, "I can't
believe I picked a nigga that can't play. "

213
00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:29,380
-Caretaker.
-Paul Crewe.

214
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,950
Whatever your pleasure,
I can facilitate.

215
00:15:32,143 --> 00:15:35,142
You need weed, you need meth...
Hey, you need Prozac, I'm your man.

216
00:15:35,343 --> 00:15:37,481
I know how you white boys
always deal with that depression.

217
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,850
I mean, me personally, I don't
understand what you white boys

218
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:41,989
all depressed about.
Hey, you're white. Smile.

219
00:15:43,054 --> 00:15:46,284
And for a small fee,
I can even get you McDonald's.

220
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,039
-Really?
-Yeah, that's right. Mickey D's.

221
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,897
My man Cheeseburger Eddy
got the hookup.

222
00:15:50,095 --> 00:15:51,022
Cheeseburger Eddy?

223
00:15:51,215 --> 00:15:52,971
That's right.
We can get our McFlurry on.

224
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:54,792
Enjoy it, fat man.

225
00:15:54,991 --> 00:15:57,031
What about the love
of a beautiful woman?

226
00:15:57,231 --> 00:15:59,620
Well, you're gonna have
to lower your standards

227
00:15:59,822 --> 00:16:01,710
on the beautiful part
and on the woman part.

228
00:16:01,902 --> 00:16:03,691
Hey.

229
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,802
Let's just stick
with the cheeseburgers.

230
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:09,065
Oh, they ugly now, but in eight months,
he gonna look like Beyoncé.

231
00:16:09,262 --> 00:16:10,190
No, thanks.

232
00:16:10,382 --> 00:16:12,237
Now, here's the most important part.

233
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:14,700
You can't let these guys scare you.
You can't let them punk you.

234
00:16:14,895 --> 00:16:17,513
Because if you do that, you gonna
end up being somebody's bitch.

235
00:16:17,966 --> 00:16:20,388
Don't want that.
Thanks for the advice.

236
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:28,584
Hey. Let me take that tray
out for you.

237
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,280
I ain't done eating yet.

238
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:32,202
Oh, you're not?
I'll give it back to you, then.

239
00:16:33,295 --> 00:16:34,789
You're dead!

240
00:16:44,047 --> 00:16:45,192
Hornet's Nest!

241
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,601
Everybody stay down.

242
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:00,108
Stay quiet!

243
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,248
Come on, Crewe, get up.

244
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:08,141
Get up, superstar.

245
00:17:09,134 --> 00:17:10,061
Yes, sir.

246
00:17:10,254 --> 00:17:13,254
You think you can do anything
you want around here, don't you?

247
00:17:13,455 --> 00:17:15,910
Well, you are no different
than any other piece of shit

248
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,768
that calls this place home.

249
00:17:18,286 --> 00:17:21,734
Really? These guys think
you're a dumb redneck too?

250
00:17:23,055 --> 00:17:24,811
Girl, that's your new boo.

251
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:33,734
You better cut that shit out.
It's getting old.

252
00:17:34,702 --> 00:17:36,164
That's gonna cost you.

253
00:17:36,495 --> 00:17:37,771
Looking forward to it.

254
00:18:29,455 --> 00:18:31,495
Wake up, Sleeping Beauty.

255
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:35,176
Hey, superdick.

256
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:40,070
Warden's wondering if your stay
in the hotbox has changed your mind.

257
00:18:40,975 --> 00:18:42,152
How long have I been in here?

258
00:18:42,351 --> 00:18:44,718
One week. Wanna go for two?

259
00:18:52,526 --> 00:18:54,087
How'd you find these guys anyways?

260
00:18:54,286 --> 00:18:55,366
Recruitment, boy.

261
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:58,763
When college stars don't get drafted,
they need a place to go.

262
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:01,893
A job, money, security.

263
00:19:02,095 --> 00:19:04,680
Who drank all the damn Gatorade?!

264
00:19:05,487 --> 00:19:06,567
Damn it!

265
00:19:06,766 --> 00:19:08,293
And apparently steroids.

266
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:12,074
Look, seems like you got all the talent
you'd want. So why do you need me?

267
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,059
Well, now, you might
find this hard to believe,

268
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:16,971
but there's folks here in the prison
league don't care for me very much.

269
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:20,133
-You, warden?
-They thought it might be amusing

270
00:19:20,335 --> 00:19:22,855
to schedule the defending
league champs as our first game.

271
00:19:23,054 --> 00:19:25,607
And me? Well, I thought
an old pro like yourself

272
00:19:25,806 --> 00:19:29,515
might have some training-camp tricks,
drills, insights to offer up.

273
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,336
Give us the competitive edge.

274
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,431
All right. Relatively simple.
You need a tune-up game.

275
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,558
A tune-up game?

276
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,271
Yeah. In college, we'd start every
season against Appalachian State

277
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,997
or some slack Division II team.

278
00:19:41,198 --> 00:19:44,297
Kick the living shit out of them.
Get their confidence up.

279
00:19:45,774 --> 00:19:47,301
You know something, Paul?

280
00:19:47,502 --> 00:19:49,739
-You've just given me an inspiration.
-That's great. What?

281
00:19:49,934 --> 00:19:52,782
You're gonna assemble a team
to play the first game against us.

282
00:19:52,975 --> 00:19:56,171
And you, Mr. Crewe,
are gonna be the quarterback.

283
00:19:56,623 --> 00:19:57,605
I don't think so.

284
00:19:57,806 --> 00:19:59,083
Let me tell you something.

285
00:19:59,278 --> 00:20:02,148
In my prison, to get along,
you gotta go along.

286
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,423
I just wanna do my three years
and be done.

287
00:20:04,622 --> 00:20:07,273
Three years is before
you assaulted Captain Knauer.

288
00:20:08,046 --> 00:20:11,526
Now, you could be with us
for a very long time, Mr. Crewe.

289
00:20:13,551 --> 00:20:15,012
Fine, I'll do it.

290
00:20:16,046 --> 00:20:17,028
Good choice.

291
00:20:18,414 --> 00:20:20,389
But one condition, though.

292
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,208
Gotta promise me to keep
Captain Knauer off my back.

293
00:20:23,406 --> 00:20:24,333
It's a deal.

294
00:20:24,526 --> 00:20:27,014
Now, you got four weeks
to assemble a team and train them.

295
00:20:27,214 --> 00:20:30,280
What, are we gonna have a half-hour
a day to practice with a Nerf ball?

296
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,927
Oh, I'll make sure my boys allow you
sufficient freedom, within these walls,

297
00:20:34,126 --> 00:20:35,849
to get your team in shape.

298
00:20:39,886 --> 00:20:43,017
What's this? "Football 'tree-outs. "'

299
00:20:43,214 --> 00:20:44,490
What the hell is a "tree-out"?

300
00:20:44,686 --> 00:20:46,442
"Tryout," you half a meatball.

301
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:49,508
-What's this football thing about, man?
-Crewe's getting a team together.

302
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,132
-To play against who?
-The guards.

303
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,847
Now, I don't know about y'all,
but I occasionally have the impulse

304
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,729
to physically assault one of our
finer correctional officers.

305
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:01,031
Yeah? Well, how the hell
we gonna get to do that?

306
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,013
Just show up at the "tree-outs,"
you big, dumb bitch.

307
00:21:05,391 --> 00:21:06,732
Do the girls get to play?

308
00:21:06,926 --> 00:21:09,643
We're playing footballs,
not balls-balls.

309
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,003
This is bullshit. Just another chance
for the guards to beat on us.

310
00:21:13,198 --> 00:21:16,100
Don't you idiots get it? We could get
a free shot at the guards.

311
00:21:16,303 --> 00:21:18,637
This is our turn.
We could beat up on them.

312
00:21:18,831 --> 00:21:20,325
We could kill them.

313
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,637
Kill them.

314
00:21:28,175 --> 00:21:31,174
You know MVP
sold his own teammates out.

315
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,376
What do you think
he's gonna do to you fools?

316
00:21:35,726 --> 00:21:38,988
And that's the truth.
With some cheese on it.

317
00:21:39,726 --> 00:21:41,614
There ain't no meat loaf
between these buns.

318
00:21:41,806 --> 00:21:44,043
Yo, man, that's my flier, man!
I worked hard on it!

319
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:47,238
You see? He ran like a little bitch,
right? You saw that, right?

320
00:21:48,014 --> 00:21:49,956
Yo, team needs you.
Team needs you.

321
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,908
You sh... You come to the tr...
Come to the tree-outs.

322
00:21:58,158 --> 00:22:00,525
Crappy field, shit-ass equipment...

323
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:03,621
Hey, man, at least we got some
world-class players over there.

324
00:22:05,902 --> 00:22:07,593
Forty-five.

325
00:22:08,334 --> 00:22:10,309
Forty-six.

326
00:22:11,214 --> 00:22:12,840
Forty-seven.

327
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,184
He might make the team.

328
00:22:14,382 --> 00:22:16,651
Well, if we gotta cut him,
you're doing it.

329
00:22:16,846 --> 00:22:18,471
Forty-nine.

330
00:22:19,374 --> 00:22:20,836
Fifty.

331
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:22,216
-All right, man.
-Good job, man.

332
00:22:22,414 --> 00:22:24,781
Well, well, well.
You a football player?

333
00:22:24,974 --> 00:22:27,843
Oh, no. I never played
no football, mister.

334
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:31,080
So, what happened? You read the flier,
thought it looked like some fun?

335
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:32,904
-Oh, I can't read.
-Oh, don't worry.

336
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:34,248
Reading's for rich people.

337
00:22:35,631 --> 00:22:38,630
So you know, we're putting together
a football team. Love you to join.

338
00:22:39,215 --> 00:22:40,873
Will you teach me to football?

339
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,209
Sure we'll teach you to football.
Won't we, Caretaker?

340
00:22:43,407 --> 00:22:45,512
Hey, I'll teach you anything.
Just don't eat me.

341
00:22:46,734 --> 00:22:48,523
Okay.

342
00:22:50,127 --> 00:22:52,199
Down, Shrek. Down!

343
00:22:52,911 --> 00:22:57,384
Okay, bring it in. Whoever's trying out
for the team, wake up.

344
00:22:57,582 --> 00:22:59,011
Can you give a brother
a little hustle?

345
00:22:59,406 --> 00:23:00,835
Very good.

346
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:03,526
For those of you who don't know
who I am, I'm Paul Crewe.

347
00:23:03,726 --> 00:23:07,523
I'm gonna be your coach,
your captain, your quarterback.

348
00:23:07,726 --> 00:23:09,635
You haven't played in years.
Why can't I be quarterback?

349
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:11,748
-You're right. Let's see what you got.
-All right.

350
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,990
-Hit me, I'm open.
-Hike, hike! Hike!

351
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,237
That's why.
Now, sit down and shut up.

352
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,252
It slipped. I just ate popcorn.

353
00:23:18,446 --> 00:23:21,545
Question: Any of you gentlemen
ever play football before?

354
00:23:22,415 --> 00:23:24,237
-You did? Where?
-Kansas State.

355
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,535
Are you shitting me?
For Coach Snyder?

356
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,299
Kansas State Prison.

357
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:32,452
Now, I hear they have
the softest mattresses out there.

358
00:23:32,654 --> 00:23:33,931
Yeah, they do.

359
00:23:34,126 --> 00:23:36,231
Not as soft as the ones
at West Texas Mental Institution.

360
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,950
-Really?
-Let's finish this conversation later.

361
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:42,117
For now, I wanna see
what you got out there.

362
00:23:42,318 --> 00:23:44,424
We'll grade them
on a scale of one to ten.

363
00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:46,695
Move it! Hustle, hustle, hustle!

364
00:23:46,894 --> 00:23:49,796
Give these guys sixes.
Give these guys fives.

365
00:23:49,998 --> 00:23:52,333
Good. Good.
Give them threes.

366
00:23:52,526 --> 00:23:53,803
Very nice!

367
00:23:55,054 --> 00:23:57,924
-Aren't we missing somebody?
-Where's the Kansas State guy?

368
00:24:00,526 --> 00:24:03,690
You assholes better not cut me!
I'm still on this team!

369
00:24:04,878 --> 00:24:05,860
Negative two.

370
00:24:06,062 --> 00:24:08,004
All right, go with negative two.

371
00:24:08,206 --> 00:24:11,272
Hey! Somebody bring me
a Diet Coke!

372
00:24:11,502 --> 00:24:13,444
-Let's do this!
-That's it!

373
00:24:13,838 --> 00:24:15,496
Five.

374
00:24:16,046 --> 00:24:17,868
Good. Seven.

375
00:24:18,606 --> 00:24:20,777
Stupid tire! You're a fricking tire!

376
00:24:20,974 --> 00:24:24,073
You think you're better than me?!
I'll kick your ass!

377
00:24:25,454 --> 00:24:26,382
Three.

378
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:29,348
And a half?

379
00:24:29,934 --> 00:24:31,821
Yeah. That's better.

380
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:33,421
Okay. Good.

381
00:24:34,062 --> 00:24:36,615
Yeah. Hit that bag, man.
There you go, man.

382
00:24:36,814 --> 00:24:37,741
Four.

383
00:24:40,014 --> 00:24:41,738
-Five. I don't know.
-I go.

384
00:24:41,934 --> 00:24:43,527
Come on, Switowski!

385
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:47,525
Daddy!

386
00:24:48,814 --> 00:24:50,091
Oh, man!

387
00:24:50,382 --> 00:24:52,205
-Look at that.
-He got it off the hinge.

388
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:54,886
-I think that's a ten.
-Let's go with a ten.

389
00:24:55,086 --> 00:24:58,315
I'm sorry. I "brokeded" your toy.

390
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:01,510
No, that's a good thing. You should
have a victory hug with Caretaker.

391
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,360
What? What you
talking about, man? Hey!

392
00:25:06,734 --> 00:25:07,661
Asshole!

393
00:25:09,518 --> 00:25:12,071
Okay, fellas, it's pretty simple.
You do a buttonhook.

394
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,659
The rest of you guys block for me.
I'll take care of the rest.

395
00:25:14,862 --> 00:25:16,869
Okay? On "go. " On "go. "

396
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,924
Ready? Break!

397
00:25:21,902 --> 00:25:23,047
We'll work on that.

398
00:25:23,758 --> 00:25:27,370
Okay, half speed on this one, guys.
Slow and easy.

399
00:25:27,566 --> 00:25:28,494
Ready?!

400
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:30,213
Go!

401
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,154
Stop it!

402
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,539
Stop the violence!

403
00:25:45,742 --> 00:25:48,131
Can't we all get along?

404
00:25:57,294 --> 00:25:59,116
-Hey, Paul.
-Unger.

405
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,349
-Team's looking great.
-Oh, yeah.

406
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,208
-So are you.
-Yep. Working on it.

407
00:26:03,406 --> 00:26:08,327
The blood of the guards is gonna flow
like the rivers of ancient Babylon.

408
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:11,842
That's good news.
Unger, you're the man.

409
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:16,645
Good job today. You're all starting
to look really sharp out there. Yeah.

410
00:26:16,846 --> 00:26:18,090
See you tomorrow.

411
00:26:18,894 --> 00:26:21,578
-We're gonna suck.
-Yeah. No doubt about it.

412
00:26:35,246 --> 00:26:37,133
You look like
you could use a little help.

413
00:26:37,326 --> 00:26:41,450
No offense, my man,
but you're a little seasoned.

414
00:26:41,645 --> 00:26:42,594
Seasoned?

415
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:45,995
I'm not asking to play. I'll coach.
I'm Nate Scarborough.

416
00:26:46,478 --> 00:26:48,071
Nate Scarborough?

417
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,052
The Heisman Trophy winner
from Oklahoma?

418
00:26:52,142 --> 00:26:55,012
The inmate from cellblock D.

419
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:58,530
But about a hundred years ago,
when I could run and gun,

420
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:01,379
yeah, I was a Sooner then.

421
00:27:01,582 --> 00:27:03,142
I heard you were dead.

422
00:27:03,342 --> 00:27:07,270
No, I ain't dead.
I've been right here, rotting.

423
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,983
Waiting for a chance to get back
at those sadistic guards.

424
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:13,963
Waiting. For this.

425
00:27:14,158 --> 00:27:15,270
Well, coach, as you can see,

426
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:18,121
we don't exactly have the cream
of the crop to work with here.

427
00:27:18,318 --> 00:27:20,457
Well, what are we gonna do?
How are we gonna find players?

428
00:27:20,653 --> 00:27:22,759
How'd they get you
to go to Florida State?

429
00:27:23,438 --> 00:27:24,452
They recruited me.

430
00:27:26,254 --> 00:27:27,912
I'll get the strippers.

431
00:27:30,766 --> 00:27:34,115
<i>Well, now, Lindsay, this isn't</i>
<i>about credit or congratulations. </i>

432
00:27:34,318 --> 00:27:36,969
This is about giving men
who've made mistakes in their lives

433
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:39,403
an opportunity
to rise above themselves.

434
00:27:39,598 --> 00:27:42,249
To move beyond
the bars of containment.

435
00:27:42,733 --> 00:27:43,682
Say what?

436
00:27:44,494 --> 00:27:46,666
What I would do to you.

437
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,979
Yeah. Nice boot, skin man.

438
00:28:00,174 --> 00:28:02,312
Hey, why does he get to be
the kicker? I was All-State, man.

439
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,201
Let's see what you got.

440
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:05,991
That's why, you dumb-ass.

441
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,913
Just go do some laps.

442
00:28:08,334 --> 00:28:09,796
I heard you boys needed to see me.

443
00:28:09,998 --> 00:28:11,689
Yeah. I want you to meet Skitchy.

444
00:28:11,885 --> 00:28:14,373
Hey, dog.
Check that building over there.

445
00:28:14,606 --> 00:28:16,810
They keep all the records
in the basement.

446
00:28:17,006 --> 00:28:19,210
He's been here so long,
he knows where everything is.

447
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,348
That ain't necessarily
a good thing, is it?

448
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:25,194
I had a parole date in '86.
But I got in a tussle with a guard and...

449
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,731
One punch and it went away.

450
00:28:26,926 --> 00:28:28,453
Twenty extra years for one punch?

451
00:28:28,654 --> 00:28:30,596
Well, unfortunately for him,
the guard he punched

452
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:32,586
just happens to be the warden now.

453
00:28:32,782 --> 00:28:34,473
Oh, shit. Warden Hazen?

454
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:35,750
"Oh, shit" is right.

455
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:40,106
Fight in the yard. Send backup.

456
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,059
Right on time.

457
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,228
-Let's do it.
-Let's do it.

458
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,303
Ain't you guys glad you got
a black man for a friend?

459
00:28:51,501 --> 00:28:53,028
-Hell, yeah.
-Come on.

460
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,531
Hazen has a rating system
for every con.

461
00:29:02,734 --> 00:29:03,978
What's three stars?

462
00:29:04,174 --> 00:29:08,811
The more prone to violence that the
inmate is, the more stars he gets.

463
00:29:09,006 --> 00:29:10,347
Five stars is the max.

464
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:13,925
I didn't know that. Let's see how many
stars my maniacal ass got.

465
00:29:17,069 --> 00:29:20,714
Half a star? That's gotta be a mistake.
Check it again. Check it again.

466
00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:22,797
You're about as maniacal
as a boxful of kittens.

467
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,102
Come on, that's not funny, man.

468
00:29:24,302 --> 00:29:26,723
I'm gonna have to stab somebody
or something. Get my rep up.

469
00:29:26,925 --> 00:29:30,057
Why don't we have a maniacal pillow
fight tonight. That could get it up some.

470
00:29:30,446 --> 00:29:32,683
Yeah. We can sell it to pay-per-view.

471
00:29:32,878 --> 00:29:35,726
<i>Superstar Versus Half-a-Star. </i>

472
00:29:36,302 --> 00:29:39,237
Why don't you shut up before I slit your
throat and watch the dust come out.

473
00:29:39,438 --> 00:29:41,096
Come on, guys,
we only got a couple minutes.

474
00:29:41,806 --> 00:29:42,733
How about this guy?

475
00:29:42,926 --> 00:29:45,609
Damn, this fool got the chair
three times, ain't died yet.

476
00:29:45,806 --> 00:29:47,562
Well, we may not have
the most talented team,

477
00:29:47,758 --> 00:29:50,092
but we will definitely
have the meanest.

478
00:30:23,886 --> 00:30:27,082
-What's he doing that for?
-Because he's a freak.

479
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:30,372
Hey, Sasquatch!
Someone's here to see you!

480
00:30:30,574 --> 00:30:32,614
Not too smart on your part.

481
00:30:35,885 --> 00:30:37,511
Hey.

482
00:30:38,317 --> 00:30:40,259
How's the headbanging coming?

483
00:30:42,669 --> 00:30:44,612
You're bleeding. Just so you know.

484
00:30:46,574 --> 00:30:49,323
People have told me that
you and I look a lot alike,

485
00:30:49,518 --> 00:30:51,657
so I wanted to see for myself.

486
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,270
I'm gonna take a piss.

487
00:30:56,109 --> 00:30:58,760
You scared him away, dumbshit.

488
00:31:04,046 --> 00:31:07,045
You're kidding. Five-star Torres
likes <i>The View</i>?

489
00:31:07,246 --> 00:31:08,490
No, just Joy Behar.

<i>breast-feed standing up. That's it. </i>

491
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:15,592
Where does she come up
with this shit?

492
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:19,907

I love that big bitch.

Us convicts are starting up
a football team.

498
00:31:30,509 --> 00:31:31,818
Not interested.

499
00:31:32,366 --> 00:31:33,576
We're playing the guards.

00:31:35,438 --> 00:31:36,682
Walk away.

501
00:31:37,485 --> 00:31:38,860
Good idea.

502
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:40,652
0 for 2.

505
00:31:44,974 --> 00:31:47,843
I still got 15 minutes of Joy Behar.

506
00:31:48,045 --> 00:31:52,355
Well, I'm cutting you short.
Back to your cell, asswipe.

507
00:31:52,749 --> 00:31:53,927
Hey, white boy.

508
00:31:56,558 --> 00:31:58,314
Cherryhead gonna play?

509
00:31:59,246 --> 00:32:00,424
Yes, he is.

510
00:32:06,381 --> 00:32:08,007
Crewe, don't forget,
I'm gonna be open.

512
00:32:15,885 --> 00:32:17,260
Damn!

513
00:32:18,765 --> 00:32:21,383
Brucie. Brucie. You all right?
You breathing?

514
00:32:21,934 --> 00:32:24,749
I got a bird. His name is Ronnie.

515
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:27,724
Well, tell Ronnie you got
knocked the fuck out.

516
00:32:30,541 --> 00:32:34,633
Wow, no bullshit. Real football?
Against the guards?

517
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:35,942
Full contact.

518
00:32:36,238 --> 00:32:37,798
Captain Knauer is their quarterback?

519
00:32:39,021 --> 00:32:42,021
-Yep.
-So I get to tackle him?

520
00:32:42,221 --> 00:32:44,905
Yeah. You can either tackle him or hit
him over the head with that hammer.

521
00:32:46,286 --> 00:32:48,675
I wanna hurt him. Not kill him.

522
00:32:49,006 --> 00:32:50,980
Let's get out of here
before that thing bites somebody.

523
00:32:51,182 --> 00:32:54,248
All right. We'll see you
and your pet iguana at practice.

524
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,124
Down, set!

525
00:33:00,205 --> 00:33:01,515

00:33:07,342 --> 00:33:08,868
-Hit me.
-Get rid of it.

528
00:33:09,838 --> 00:33:11,300
Get rid of it!

529

He didn't get rid of it.

Somebody's gotta get open, guys.

532
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:22,476
You got hammered by the hammer.

533
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:25,572
I think I felt it on my leg.
We gotta get some speed, man.

534
00:33:25,773 --> 00:33:27,596
What'd you expect?
You got no brothers out there.

535
00:33:27,789 --> 00:33:29,480
What are you talking about?
We got Switowski.

536
00:33:30,413 --> 00:33:32,486
Switowski? That's one brother.

537
00:33:32,685 --> 00:33:34,507
That's a lonely nigga.
This ain't hockey.

538
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,157
You want some speed,
you know where to go.

539
00:33:45,294 --> 00:33:47,847
Hey, yo, check out
this fake Slim Shady, man.

540
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,368
I knew you couldn't resist my shit.

541
00:33:51,566 --> 00:33:53,671
I got the shakes
that'll make you quake.

542
00:33:53,869 --> 00:33:56,553
I got the fries that'll cross your eyes.

543
00:33:56,749 --> 00:33:58,659
I got the burgers that'Il...

544
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:02,347
I just got burgers.

545
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:03,556
I'm all right. Thank you.

546
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:07,747
Just wanted to talk to you fellas about
possibly joining the football team.

547
00:34:08,557 --> 00:34:10,019
The only game we'd play with you is

548
00:34:10,221 --> 00:34:14,956
Slap the Point-Shaving White Boy
Till He Cries Like a Baby-Back Bitch.

-Yeah.

551
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:27,972

552
00:34:29,966 --> 00:34:31,210
Thank you, Half-a-Star.

553
00:34:32,109 --> 00:34:33,997
Just so you know,
we are playing the guards.

554
00:34:34,189 --> 00:34:36,840
That ain't a team.
That's just a bunch of dumb rednecks

555
00:34:37,038 --> 00:34:39,427
giving themselves excuses
to grab each other.

556
00:34:40,493 --> 00:34:42,598
This guy must be
quite the athlete, huh?

557
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:46,605
You risk bringing your ass in the jungle
because you know I am.

558
00:34:46,798 --> 00:34:49,831
Yeah, so you'd beat me
in a game of one-on-one, right?

559
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,997
-What?
-I think it's time for you to get stepping.

560
00:34:53,198 --> 00:34:55,237
How's this, though? One game.

561
00:34:55,438 --> 00:34:59,431
I beat you, you guys play for the team.
You beat me, I'll leave you alone.

562
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,404
Take that. Take that, Deac.

563
00:35:02,606 --> 00:35:04,646
This fool ain't nothing
but a thing, baby.

564
00:35:05,582 --> 00:35:08,102
-Ball, dog.
-Ball up!

565
00:35:08,302 --> 00:35:09,611
Can Crewe play ball?

566
00:35:09,805 --> 00:35:11,016
He's a natural athlete.

567
00:35:11,213 --> 00:35:14,344
So is Greg Louganis, but I bet you
he'd get his ass whupped out here.

568
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:17,066
-Game's 11. Call your own fouls.
-Okay.

569
00:35:18,445 --> 00:35:20,518
-Come on, come on.
-Give it to him, Deac!

570
00:35:25,261 --> 00:35:26,308
Did I get you?

571
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:28,169
No, that was clean.

572
00:35:28,366 --> 00:35:30,253
He'll be all right. Call his mama.

573
00:35:30,446 --> 00:35:32,813
-If I foul you, tell me, dog.
-Okay, baby.

574
00:35:36,685 --> 00:35:38,114

All right.

577
00:35:44,781 --> 00:35:46,472
Get up! Get up, Deac!

578
00:35:46,797 --> 00:35:47,779
Come on, Paul!

579
00:35:47,982 --> 00:35:49,029
-Calm down.
-What?

580
00:35:49,229 --> 00:35:51,564
Now, don't stir up
the brothers, now. Come on.

Come on, Deacon!

582
00:36:01,645 --> 00:36:02,790
Did I get you, dog?

583
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:05,707
Hell, no, baby. That was clean.
Good D.

584
00:36:05,901 --> 00:36:07,211
I thought he didn't wanna get hurt.

585
00:36:07,405 --> 00:36:09,827
It ain't about getting hurt.
It's about pride.

586
00:36:10,029 --> 00:36:11,851
I bet you he's pretty proud right now.

-No, I think I'm okay, baby.
-I didn't get you, did I?

Game point, baby.
How you want the game put up?

593
00:37:30,829 --> 00:37:31,844
Foul.

594
00:37:33,645 --> 00:37:35,652
That was a bullshit call!

595

All right, y'all. Let Deac speak!

597

Nice spanking that ass, dog.

598
00:37:59,246 --> 00:38:01,515
-Now, get stepping.
-Hold up.

599
00:38:05,293 --> 00:38:06,602
Y'all got a running back?

600
00:38:07,149 --> 00:38:08,709
Not any good ones.

601
00:38:09,102 --> 00:38:10,443
No disrespect, Deac...

602

...but any man that can take
that kind of beating out here,

603
00:38:14,189 --> 00:38:16,742
I can't wait to see what he can do
in a contact sport.

604

Shit, I'm in.

605

Man, give me that cheeseburger.

Earl Megget.

609
00:38:30,765 --> 00:38:34,857
Well, we didn't get the whole chocolate
bar, but we got a Hershey's Kiss.

610
00:38:35,053 --> 00:38:36,068
I'll take it.

611

I'm starving.

Get him!

618
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:15,335
Ran right out of your shoes, huh?
Hey, manager, don't you think

619
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:17,770
we can get our new star running back
a decent pair of cleats?

620
00:39:17,966 --> 00:39:20,965
Yeah. I think I got a cousin
that drives a truck for Reebok.

621
00:39:21,165 --> 00:39:23,467
It's cool, man.
I never had shoes growing up no way.

622
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:25,287
-I'll be all right for now.
-Oh, okay.

623
00:39:25,965 --> 00:39:27,874
Get your country ass
back in the huddle.

624
00:39:28,078 --> 00:39:29,604
That boy got some slave feet,
you see that?

625
00:39:31,918 --> 00:39:33,925
Defense! Huddle up over there!

626
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:35,849
Paul. Paul.

627
00:39:36,045 --> 00:39:38,020
Hey, ladies. How's it hanging?

628
00:39:38,221 --> 00:39:40,163
-Tell him.
-I'm gonna say something to him.

629
00:39:40,365 --> 00:39:43,212
I just wanted to let you know
I am your biggest fan.

630
00:39:43,405 --> 00:39:47,267
And I will be cheering my jailhouse
boobies off for you at game day.

631
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:48,876
I appreciate that. Thank you.

632
00:39:49,069 --> 00:39:50,476
Paul.

633
00:39:51,245 --> 00:39:52,969
I appreciate you.

634
00:39:53,517 --> 00:39:55,427
Okay, thanks. I'm glad to know that.

635
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:58,668
Okay, are you done now?

636
00:39:58,861 --> 00:40:01,414
What's wrong with you? Jealous
because I don't cheer for you anymore?

637
00:40:01,613 --> 00:40:03,718
I don't know what
you're talking about, freak show.

638
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:05,477
Whatever, back freckles.

639
00:40:05,997 --> 00:40:08,234
Oh, yeah, back freckles.
She's making up shit now.

640
00:40:08,429 --> 00:40:09,804
I'm gonna get some water.

641
00:40:11,341 --> 00:40:13,512
That feature interview
worked better than I thought.

642
00:40:13,709 --> 00:40:15,781
I just got off the phone with ESPN2.

643
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:18,632
They want to televise
the football game.

644
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:22,178
Guards, cons, Paul Crewe,
it's compelling stuff.

645
00:40:22,381 --> 00:40:24,421
Lots of human interest.

646
00:40:24,621 --> 00:40:26,311
Don't do that in here.

647
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:28,811
Television.

648
00:40:29,837 --> 00:40:31,976
Dandridge, do you think
that might help my visibility

649
00:40:32,173 --> 00:40:34,115
with the registered voters
of this fine state?

650
00:40:34,477 --> 00:40:35,786
Oh, yes.

651
00:40:51,725 --> 00:40:53,448
The freak is back!

652
00:41:06,061 --> 00:41:07,588
Hey, hey. It's me again.

653
00:41:09,901 --> 00:41:12,770
You know, if I take this half down,
we could play together.

654
00:41:14,925 --> 00:41:16,933
I'm just gonna take this half down.

655
00:41:20,205 --> 00:41:22,725
Don't worry. Don't worry.
I got another ball.

656
00:41:23,885 --> 00:41:25,128
It's okay.

657
00:41:25,741 --> 00:41:27,083
You wanna serve?

658
00:41:28,493 --> 00:41:29,605
I'll serve.

659
00:41:35,277 --> 00:41:38,027
Really good news.
We started a football team.

660
00:41:38,381 --> 00:41:39,788
You like football?

661
00:41:39,981 --> 00:41:41,355
It's kind of like Ping-Pong.

662
00:41:41,549 --> 00:41:44,746
Only the ball's a little bigger
and egg-shaped, like my head.

663
00:41:46,029 --> 00:41:48,778
Just a joke. Stay calm.

664
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:51,591
Give you a good chance
to throw people on the ground,

665
00:41:51,789 --> 00:41:55,913
hurt them like you used to when you
were a kid, 10 feet 6 inches ago.

666
00:41:58,189 --> 00:42:00,099
We'd be playing the guards.

667
00:42:03,405 --> 00:42:05,292
I think Papajohn's their safety.

668
00:42:22,861 --> 00:42:25,610
Turley, nobody gets to me.
We'll play more Ping-Pong later, okay?

669
00:42:29,101 --> 00:42:30,508
Hut!

670
00:42:34,861 --> 00:42:35,908
Effective.

671
00:42:36,685 --> 00:42:40,100
-All right.
-He brokeded my nose.

672
00:42:43,053 --> 00:42:44,777
I don't wanna play no more.

673
00:42:44,973 --> 00:42:47,112
Hey, hey, hey. Switowski,
what are you talking about?

674
00:42:47,309 --> 00:42:48,869
This is football. Shit happens.

675
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:51,622
Paul, he brokeded my nose.

676
00:42:51,821 --> 00:42:53,195
Okay. Stop crying.

677
00:42:53,709 --> 00:42:56,230
All right. We can fix this.
Here we go.

678
00:42:57,581 --> 00:42:59,850
Okay. Good, good.

679
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:01,570
How's it look?

680
00:43:01,773 --> 00:43:04,969
How's it look? It looks... It looks like...
It looks better than before.

681
00:43:05,901 --> 00:43:07,940
-Really?
-Yeah, it's straighter.

682
00:43:08,141 --> 00:43:11,141
More distinguished.
Kind of like a young Michael Jackson.

683
00:43:11,341 --> 00:43:13,446
I love little Michael.

684
00:43:13,645 --> 00:43:15,238
That's great. That's great.

685
00:43:16,525 --> 00:43:18,118
I think he did it on purpose.

686
00:43:18,317 --> 00:43:20,172
No, he didn't.

687
00:43:22,221 --> 00:43:23,715
Okay, maybe he did.

688
00:43:23,917 --> 00:43:26,699
You gotta apologize to him.
Come on, Turley.

689
00:43:28,269 --> 00:43:29,830
Say you're sorry.

690
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:33,155
Come on. Say it.

691
00:43:36,813 --> 00:43:40,042
He said he's sorry.
I got him to say he's sorry.

692
00:43:40,237 --> 00:43:41,764
Yeah, yeah. We're all impressed.

693
00:43:44,429 --> 00:43:46,666
Looking good, gentlemen.
Way to work hard.

694
00:43:46,861 --> 00:43:48,934
Good practice, Paul!
Me and the girls wanna show you

695
00:43:49,133 --> 00:43:50,330
-what we've been practicing.
-Okay, hit me.

696
00:43:50,364 --> 00:43:51,527
-What we've been practicing.
-Okay, hit me.

697
00:43:52,141 --> 00:43:54,759
Come on, let's go. One, two, three.

698
00:43:54,957 --> 00:43:57,740
Give me a...

699
00:43:57,933 --> 00:44:01,097
<i>D, D, give me a I</i>
<i>I, I, give me a C</i>

700
00:44:01,293 --> 00:44:02,241
<i>C, give me a</i>...

701
00:44:02,445 --> 00:44:05,576
All right, all right! I got it.
Just save it for the game.

702
00:44:05,772 --> 00:44:07,561
Don't act like you ain't
want to see more, Brucie!

703
00:44:07,757 --> 00:44:09,829
-Yeah, you wish, pal.
-No, you wish I'd kiss you again,

704
00:44:10,029 --> 00:44:12,843
because your breath
smell like eight cans of shark shit.

705
00:44:13,037 --> 00:44:14,499
I wouldn't touch her
with a 10-foot pole.

706
00:44:14,701 --> 00:44:16,195
-What's he talking about?
-He's a freak.

707
00:44:29,164 --> 00:44:31,466
Run, Forrest, run!

708
00:44:35,853 --> 00:44:38,242
That's how a white man plays guitar.

709
00:44:41,613 --> 00:44:43,620
Captain, he said he had some info.

710
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:47,137
You guys have "Halo 2."
I didn't even think that was out yet.

711
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:49,544
Focus. Turn the music off!

712
00:44:49,741 --> 00:44:51,813
Yeah, captain.
You know them convicts?

713
00:44:52,013 --> 00:44:53,769
They're starting to get
some serious players.

714
00:44:53,965 --> 00:44:56,965
But their biggest threat?
A running back. Megget.

715
00:44:57,165 --> 00:44:59,466
-He's good?
-He's fast.

716
00:44:59,661 --> 00:45:01,897
He's really, really fast.

717
00:45:02,093 --> 00:45:05,955
I mean, he's so fast,
he makes fast people look not fast.

718
00:45:06,156 --> 00:45:07,466
I got it, he's fast.

719
00:45:07,661 --> 00:45:10,411
Now, why don't you show us your speed
and get your pyro ass out of here.

720
00:45:11,245 --> 00:45:13,962
Yes, sir. Here I go. I'm sorry.

721
00:45:25,708 --> 00:45:28,774
Any books
you'd recommend, inmate?

722
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:31,468
No, sir.

723
00:45:33,581 --> 00:45:35,043
Not much of a reader.

724
00:45:35,404 --> 00:45:39,430
Oh, come on, now, maggot.
I've seen you in here reading before.

725
00:45:39,629 --> 00:45:41,800
You requested this detail.
Isn't that right?

726
00:45:45,389 --> 00:45:48,488
No. It's the quiet time I like, sir.

727
00:45:49,389 --> 00:45:50,633
Maybe you'd like to read this.

728
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:54,789
What the hell kind of bullshit
book is that?

729
00:45:54,989 --> 00:45:57,225
It's historical. Sir.

730
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,876
Now, why would he want to read
a book about a four-eyed nigger?

731
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:08,171
Does the N word
offend you, nigger?

732
00:46:09,293 --> 00:46:10,471
No, sir.

733
00:46:17,389 --> 00:46:19,277
Sorry about that.

734
00:46:19,724 --> 00:46:22,375
You mind fetching
these books for me, boy?

735
00:46:25,165 --> 00:46:26,539
No, sir.

736
00:46:26,733 --> 00:46:28,555
Just pick them up.
Put them on the table.

737
00:46:32,044 --> 00:46:33,189
There you go.

738
00:46:38,605 --> 00:46:40,394
You forgot one.

739
00:46:47,021 --> 00:46:48,428
Bet you'd like to hit us, huh?

740
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,715
Hit you, sir? No.

741
00:46:54,605 --> 00:46:55,782
Y'all my friends.

742
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:01,762
Pick these up.

743
00:47:22,028 --> 00:47:23,141
Go!

744
00:47:24,013 --> 00:47:25,671
Hit me! I'm open! I'm open!

745
00:47:30,029 --> 00:47:32,330
Come on! We got one week
before we play that game.

746
00:47:32,524 --> 00:47:33,866
We can't complete a pass yet.

747
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:37,377
-Megget can't run the ball every play.
-I know, coach.

748
00:47:37,965 --> 00:47:39,852
What the hell is he smiling at?

749
00:47:55,085 --> 00:47:56,743
This better be on the up and up.

750
00:47:57,805 --> 00:47:58,819
I guarantee it.

751
00:47:59,308 --> 00:48:00,650
Let's do this shit.

752
00:48:00,845 --> 00:48:02,339
There goes the neighborhood.

753
00:48:08,044 --> 00:48:09,702
Now I'll never get to play.

754
00:48:34,284 --> 00:48:37,700
Did you see that? Did you see that?
The Deac is here!

755
00:48:37,901 --> 00:48:38,981
Nice.

756
00:48:39,405 --> 00:48:40,932
Okay, we seal off here, seal off here.

757
00:48:41,133 --> 00:48:42,540
-Cheeseburger.
-Yeah.

758
00:48:42,733 --> 00:48:44,326
You're just gonna chip this guy...

759
00:49:01,325 --> 00:49:02,252
That stings.

760
00:49:02,445 --> 00:49:05,096
It's nothing a Quarter Pounder
can't fix.

761
00:49:07,693 --> 00:49:08,773
With cheese on it?

762
00:49:08,973 --> 00:49:10,435
Hut!

763
00:49:34,092 --> 00:49:36,263
Man, that boy would catch a cold
in the desert. Here you go.

764
00:49:36,461 --> 00:49:38,949
-Everything's looking up.
-Yeah.

765
00:49:39,148 --> 00:49:41,352
Still got one more
pain in the ass to deal with.

766
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,253
All right, what do you say?
How about a little best ball?

767
00:49:53,452 --> 00:49:56,387
No, I hate that bullshit.
Everyone play their own damn ball.

768
00:49:56,588 --> 00:49:58,344
Holy shit, is that Paul Crewe?

769
00:49:58,541 --> 00:50:02,119
How do you like that, boys?
The MVP coming to kiss my ass.

770
00:50:02,892 --> 00:50:04,965
So, what's on your mind, Paul?

771
00:50:05,164 --> 00:50:06,822
Got a problem with inmate Unger.

772
00:50:07,852 --> 00:50:10,787
-Is he on your little squad?
-I believe he's on your little squad.

773
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,184
Mr. Crewe, would you mind
if we had a picture? Please?

774
00:50:14,988 --> 00:50:16,232
That's up to the warden.

775
00:50:16,844 --> 00:50:19,113
-Damn it. All right.
-Rewound it. Did everything.

776
00:50:19,309 --> 00:50:21,643
-The flash is ready.
-You don't need a flash. It's daylight.

777
00:50:21,837 --> 00:50:23,909
Oh, my bad.
I just want a good picture.

778
00:50:24,428 --> 00:50:27,592
You know, I think you had sex
with my wife before I married her.

779
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,246
-Sorry about that.
-Oh, hell, no.

780
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:33,510
If she's hot enough to have
a one-nighter with a pro football player,

781
00:50:33,709 --> 00:50:35,432
I must be doing all right.

782
00:50:35,948 --> 00:50:37,355
Okay, here we go.

783
00:50:38,028 --> 00:50:40,134
-Sergeant Engleheart?
-Yes, warden.

784
00:50:40,332 --> 00:50:42,088
Would you step out
of the picture, please?

785
00:50:42,701 --> 00:50:43,748
Yes, sir.

786
00:50:46,189 --> 00:50:48,556
-His wife has got the hottest ass.
-Great.

787
00:50:48,749 --> 00:50:49,992
Just cut to the chase, shall we?

788
00:50:50,604 --> 00:50:53,223
You don't actually think you have
a chance of winning, now, do you?

789
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,013
We're gonna get
our asses handed to us.

790
00:50:55,213 --> 00:50:59,435
I know it. You know it.
I just don't want my players to know it.

791
00:50:59,629 --> 00:51:01,036
Your players?

792
00:51:02,668 --> 00:51:05,188
Just when I thought
I had you all figured out.

793
00:51:05,389 --> 00:51:07,298
-What does that mean?
-In the time you've been here,

794
00:51:07,501 --> 00:51:09,508
you haven't made or received
one telephone call.

795
00:51:09,708 --> 00:51:12,075
You haven't opened so much
as a single shred of mail.

796
00:51:12,268 --> 00:51:14,505
What do you give a damn
about those slimeballs?

797
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,707
You never cared about anybody
in your entire life.

798
00:51:17,228 --> 00:51:19,333
Well, maybe I finally found
that sense of family

799
00:51:19,533 --> 00:51:21,835
I been yearning for since I'm a baby.

800
00:51:22,028 --> 00:51:23,076
And gosh almighty,

801
00:51:23,277 --> 00:51:24,870
my new family and I
would sure appreciate it

802
00:51:25,068 --> 00:51:27,403
if you got Unger off the field.
You hear?

803
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,184
Sergeant Engleheart.

804
00:51:30,668 --> 00:51:31,813
Thank you.

805
00:51:32,365 --> 00:51:33,826
Oh, and as for your request...

806
00:51:35,853 --> 00:51:38,187
...you'll have my answer
soon enough.

807
00:51:50,572 --> 00:51:52,296
Did it rain last night?

808
00:51:52,492 --> 00:51:53,670
Not a drop.

809
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:00,071
Son of a bitch.

810
00:52:00,428 --> 00:52:02,086
All right, boys.

811
00:52:05,197 --> 00:52:08,164
The warden is trying
to break our spirit.

812
00:52:08,908 --> 00:52:10,795
He thinks we're gonna
skip practice today,

813
00:52:10,988 --> 00:52:13,509
wait for the field to dry,
make it up tomorrow.

814
00:52:13,708 --> 00:52:14,886
You know what? Who gives a shit?

815
00:52:15,084 --> 00:52:17,801
Three days till game time.
We can handle it.

816
00:52:17,997 --> 00:52:19,753
But let me say this:

817
00:52:20,652 --> 00:52:24,068
That old man flooding this field
tells me something.

818
00:52:25,165 --> 00:52:27,499
The guy is scared.

819
00:52:27,693 --> 00:52:32,003
Scared of you sick,
degenerate convicts.

820
00:52:32,204 --> 00:52:33,862
And you know what?

821
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:36,619
He should be.

822
00:52:36,941 --> 00:52:38,796
Because I got news for you guys.

823
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,325
We're gonna win this thing.

824
00:52:41,772 --> 00:52:43,267
Did he say "win"?

825
00:52:43,788 --> 00:52:45,676
What's it gonna be, boys?

826
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:49,926
Do we go back to our cells,
call it a day?

827
00:52:50,284 --> 00:52:54,986
Or do we get ourselves ready
for the greatest ass-kicking fiesta

828
00:52:55,181 --> 00:52:57,221
in the history of football?

829
00:52:58,028 --> 00:52:59,752
I'll leave it up to you guys.

830
00:53:19,021 --> 00:53:22,217
Hey. You're part
of the goddamn team.

831
00:53:22,413 --> 00:53:24,933
Get your point-shaving ass in there.

832
00:53:25,549 --> 00:53:26,759
You got it.

833
00:54:11,052 --> 00:54:14,020
I guess that asshole Hazen
wants to play dirty.

834
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:17,035
-We all convicts, right?
-Right.

835
00:54:17,229 --> 00:54:19,138
Maybe it's time
we started acting like it.

836
00:54:20,877 --> 00:54:22,218
Right here. Right here.

837
00:54:24,172 --> 00:54:25,284
Take it, Deac.

838
00:54:25,484 --> 00:54:28,331
Let's see which guards
have some broken bones.

839
00:54:46,956 --> 00:54:47,883
Yeah!

840
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:25,546
Shoes, nigga!

841
00:55:35,692 --> 00:55:39,718
Check this out. These be brass
knuckles. They damn near old as me.

842
00:55:39,916 --> 00:55:41,345
Hut!

843
00:55:41,548 --> 00:55:44,396
That's perfect, Cheeseburger!
Never been better.

844
00:55:54,796 --> 00:55:55,779
Good ball. Good ball.

845
00:55:59,532 --> 00:56:00,874
Okay.

846
00:56:03,564 --> 00:56:05,320
-Who we gonna crush?
-The guards!

847
00:56:05,517 --> 00:56:07,305
-Who we gonna kill?
-The guards!

848
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,387
-Who we gonna kiss?
-The guards!

849
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:10,507
Gotcha.

850
00:56:20,269 --> 00:56:21,698
Lights out!

851
00:56:23,276 --> 00:56:25,000
Good night, ladies.

852
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:32,613
-Yo, Crewe!
-Yes, Mr. Caretaker.

853
00:56:32,812 --> 00:56:36,008
Check your toilet. There should be
a little surprise in there for you.

854
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:37,991
You took a shit in my toilet?

855
00:56:38,188 --> 00:56:40,741
No, that's the surprise
I left in Brucie's toilet.

856
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,144
-You got something else.
-All right.

857
00:56:43,948 --> 00:56:45,442
Well, would you look at this.

858
00:56:45,644 --> 00:56:49,353
A bottle of Ketel One
and two glasses?

859
00:56:49,548 --> 00:56:50,922
Now, what would I need two for?

860
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:53,003
Just shut up
and pour me a drink, bitch.

861
00:56:53,228 --> 00:56:57,505
-Man, who taught you to be so cool?
-My mama.

862
00:56:57,932 --> 00:57:01,893
Now, when I get out of here, I don't
want you to get all Hollywood on us.

863
00:57:02,092 --> 00:57:03,401
I want you to meet her.

864
00:57:03,596 --> 00:57:06,563
Here, look at my girl.
She's your biggest fan.

865
00:57:08,492 --> 00:57:10,052
Your mom's beautiful.

866
00:57:11,084 --> 00:57:13,092
And you, you are ugly.

867
00:57:13,292 --> 00:57:15,332
Thank you. Got it.

868
00:57:16,268 --> 00:57:18,090
Here's to...

869
00:57:19,084 --> 00:57:21,866
...the first friend I've had
in I don't know how long.

870
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:24,068
Hey, I thought
I was your friend, Paul.

871
00:57:24,268 --> 00:57:28,196
You are, Switowski. Just finish your
coloring book and go back to sleep.

872
00:57:28,396 --> 00:57:29,323
Okay.

873
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:32,228
And here's to having one of these
with you on the outside,

874
00:57:32,428 --> 00:57:34,664
sometime in the next
three to five years.

875
00:57:36,684 --> 00:57:38,342
-Yo, Crewe.
-Yes, sir.

876
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:40,874
You being a ex-football player
and all,

877
00:57:41,068 --> 00:57:43,010
I'm sure you got a lot
of hot ass on the outside.

878
00:57:43,212 --> 00:57:46,212
Well, let's not forget I wasn't
the most popular guy out there.

879
00:57:46,412 --> 00:57:47,340
Don't give me that shit.

880
00:57:47,532 --> 00:57:49,506
O.J. Chopped his wife's head off
and still got some ass.

881
00:57:50,412 --> 00:57:51,622
Yeah.

882
00:57:51,916 --> 00:57:54,764
My mama taught me not to kiss
and tell. Now, go to sleep.

883
00:57:54,957 --> 00:57:56,899
All right. I got one more question
to ask you.

884
00:57:57,324 --> 00:57:59,048
Okay. What is it?

885
00:58:01,612 --> 00:58:03,205
Why'd you shave those points?

886
00:58:05,996 --> 00:58:08,996
Didn't you read the papers?
I'm innocent.

887
00:58:09,196 --> 00:58:11,368
Yeah. Ain't we all?

888
00:58:13,868 --> 00:58:15,297
Yo, Crewe, what would you say

889
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,467
if I could get you film
from the guards' games last year?

890
00:58:18,668 --> 00:58:20,872
I would say that's incredible,
but how?

891
00:58:21,644 --> 00:58:23,018
Thanks, gentlemen.

892
00:58:23,212 --> 00:58:26,660
The warden will be done with him
in 15 minutes.

893
00:58:27,532 --> 00:58:30,314
-We can handle him.
-Yes, ma'am.

894
00:58:30,508 --> 00:58:32,232
Then you're gonna, ma'am.

895
00:58:36,588 --> 00:58:37,865
Nice job.

896
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:43,940
I can't tell you how much this means
to me. Thank you, Lynette.

897
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,409
Now Nate can study
all the guards' formations.

898
00:58:46,604 --> 00:58:49,287
Not so fast, sugar bear.

899
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:51,426
You gotta earn them.

900
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:02,530
We only got 15 minutes,

901
00:59:02,732 --> 00:59:06,474
but, sunshine, we're gonna
make them all count.

902
00:59:18,828 --> 00:59:20,487
One more, please?

903
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:29,958
Let's go.

904
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:39,235
-Quiet down. Guys.
-Let's go.

905
00:59:39,436 --> 00:59:42,153
Before we watch the guards'
game film from last season,

906
00:59:42,348 --> 00:59:46,625
we have a special presentation
from our very own Mr. Paul Crewe.

907
00:59:48,396 --> 00:59:50,119
What are you talking about?

908
00:59:51,468 --> 00:59:52,897
What's going on?

909
00:59:56,972 --> 00:59:59,241
Now I gotta relive this shit?

910
01:00:14,668 --> 01:00:16,293
Yeah!

911
01:00:19,052 --> 01:00:22,020
You can say this,
my man's a team player!

912
01:00:23,788 --> 01:00:27,749
You know what they say. Once
you go gray, there ain't no other way!

913
01:00:28,108 --> 01:00:30,922
Hey, hey, hey. Brucie! Brucie!
I'm glad you think that's funny,

914
01:00:31,116 --> 01:00:33,091
because I got something pretty funny
to show you guys.

915
01:00:33,292 --> 01:00:35,561
Tony, hit it. You're gonna like this.

916
01:00:42,732 --> 01:00:46,048
-What the hell is this?
-What? It's good. It keeps going.

917
01:00:46,252 --> 01:00:48,291
-<i>Hi. </i>
-<i>Here I am. </i>

918
01:00:48,492 --> 01:00:50,118
Turn this shit off. Turn it off.

919
01:00:50,764 --> 01:00:52,008
No!

920
01:00:57,356 --> 01:00:59,723
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very funny.
Trick photography.

921
01:01:08,876 --> 01:01:10,120
Nothing happened.
Nothing happened.

922
01:01:10,316 --> 01:01:12,104
I was showing a little wrestling move.
That's all.

923
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:13,835
Knock it off!

924
01:01:14,028 --> 01:01:15,370
Knock it off!

925
01:01:15,884 --> 01:01:18,023
It's time we took a look
at what we came here to see

926
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:20,075
before the guards come back.

927
01:01:21,452 --> 01:01:24,714
The first film is the guards' offense
against Texas Southern.

928
01:01:24,908 --> 01:01:28,006
Now, as you can see,
they're running a standard wishbone.

929
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:37,318
So you're telling me that these animals
are watching our game films.

930
01:01:37,516 --> 01:01:39,272
-Is that right?
-Yes, sir, boss.

931
01:01:39,468 --> 01:01:40,875
They got all last season.

932
01:01:41,771 --> 01:01:44,193
Seems to me that we ought to
do something about this.

933
01:01:44,396 --> 01:01:45,989
What do you want me to do?

934
01:01:46,188 --> 01:01:48,260
You're the criminal. Be creative.

935
01:01:48,684 --> 01:01:51,554
But on game day, if I so much as...

936
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:55,307
What are you doing?

937
01:01:56,908 --> 01:02:00,039
I don't know.
I've had hot flashes all shift,

938
01:02:00,236 --> 01:02:02,440
and now my nipples are killing me.

939
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:04,197
Why are we talking about
your nipples?

940
01:02:04,652 --> 01:02:07,041
We're not. Just go do
what you're doing there.

941
01:02:07,244 --> 01:02:08,553
Guys.

942
01:02:09,772 --> 01:02:12,586
I want Crewe finished.

943
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:16,741
Yes, sir. You give me the inspiration,
sir. I got something for him.

944
01:02:17,899 --> 01:02:19,077
Hut!

945
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,154
Everybody!

946
01:02:27,692 --> 01:02:28,870
Huddle up!

947
01:02:32,651 --> 01:02:37,190
Every day we've been taking shit,
for a long time.

948
01:02:37,803 --> 01:02:42,408
Tomorrow, payback.
Now, think about that for a second.

949
01:03:25,548 --> 01:03:27,588
-What time is it?
-Game time!

950
01:03:27,788 --> 01:03:29,348
-What time is it?
-Game time!

951
01:03:29,547 --> 01:03:32,864
-What time is it?
-Game time!

952
01:03:36,044 --> 01:03:40,005
Tomorrow, 12:00, the bus leaves.
Don't be late!

953
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,075
Where the hell is Caretaker?

954
01:03:44,716 --> 01:03:45,893
I don't know.

955
01:04:12,843 --> 01:04:15,298
A gift for you, Mr. Crewe.

956
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:19,650
How does he listen
to that cracker shit?

957
01:06:42,281 --> 01:06:44,353
<i>We're here deep in the heart</i>
<i>of toothless country,</i>

958
01:06:44,553 --> 01:06:47,041
<i>coming to you from a simple</i>
<i>Texas high school stadium</i>

959
01:06:47,241 --> 01:06:49,380
<i>that's been retrofitted</i>
<i>for the big event. </i>

960
01:06:49,577 --> 01:06:51,846
Now, when my man Travis
tried to drag me out here, I said,

961
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:54,277
"What are you, brain-dead from
talking to too many Raider fans?

962
01:06:54,473 --> 01:06:55,455
It's not going to work. "

963
01:06:55,658 --> 01:06:58,560
But the fact of the matter is,
this could shape up as an epic day.

964
01:06:58,761 --> 01:07:01,627
<i>Hot-dog vendors, high-powered rifles,</i>
<i>I love the combination. </i>

965
01:07:01,842 --> 01:07:04,031
<i>And apparently so do the fans. </i>

966
01:07:07,465 --> 01:07:08,959
Hey, shitheads! Listen up!

967
01:07:09,562 --> 01:07:11,318
Everybody on their feet
for the warden.

968
01:07:15,578 --> 01:07:17,880
Anthony, wow. You can sit down.

969
01:07:18,873 --> 01:07:20,335
Thank God.

970
01:07:22,042 --> 01:07:24,627
Gentlemen, Texas marshals
have been kind enough

971
01:07:24,826 --> 01:07:28,175
to supply us with a dozen
of their finest sharpshooters.

972
01:07:28,793 --> 01:07:31,957
So for those of you thinking
of mingling with the civilians

973
01:07:32,154 --> 01:07:33,714
or trying to make a break for it,

974
01:07:34,266 --> 01:07:35,607
you will be shot.

975
01:07:37,242 --> 01:07:38,321
In the head.

976
01:07:41,881 --> 01:07:44,915
Now, let's all go out there
and have some fun!

977
01:07:47,737 --> 01:07:50,771
Crewe! I'll see you on the field!

978
01:07:53,177 --> 01:07:54,770
I think he's in love with you.

979
01:07:55,802 --> 01:07:57,711
All right, listen up.

980
01:07:57,914 --> 01:08:01,656
I know it's hard to get psyched for
the game without Caretaker being here.

981
01:08:02,425 --> 01:08:04,913
But somehow that sick,
skinny bastard

982
01:08:05,113 --> 01:08:08,943
found a way to get us all fired up
from beyond the grave.

983
01:08:10,042 --> 01:08:12,409
Caretaker's last gift to us.

984
01:08:12,601 --> 01:08:15,187
Battle, I presume this is yours.

985
01:08:16,889 --> 01:08:18,962
I still don't think that's big enough.

986
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:23,603
-That's it?
-No, that ain't it.

987
01:08:23,930 --> 01:08:26,296
Caretaker said he'd find us
some gear to wear.

988
01:08:30,362 --> 01:08:32,783
I think he found us a name too.

989
01:08:36,826 --> 01:08:39,990
<i>Mean Machine! Mean Machine!</i>
<i>Mean Machine! Mean Machine!</i>

990
01:08:52,345 --> 01:08:56,600
<i>Good afternoon and welcome to a</i>
<i>very special edition of ESPN football. </i>

991
01:08:56,793 --> 01:09:00,022
<i>As today, the semipro</i>
<i>Allenville Federal Prison guards</i>

992
01:09:00,218 --> 01:09:02,738

<i>they guard. </i>

993
01:09:02,938 --> 01:09:06,233
And with this special game, folks,
comes a special broadcast,

994
01:09:06,426 --> 01:09:09,557
as I'm joined in the booth
by Baby Face Bob.

995
01:09:09,753 --> 01:09:11,412
Say hi to the folks, Bob-O.

996
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:14,675
Chris, we went to a commercial.

997
01:09:14,874 --> 01:09:17,940
This job, Bob,
it's a lot of give and take.

998
01:09:18,137 --> 01:09:20,821
So when I bring you in,
don't be afraid to talk to the folks.

999
01:09:23,065 --> 01:09:24,952
Unless you don't want to.

1000
01:09:28,217 --> 01:09:29,678
<i>And here come the cons,</i>

1001
01:09:29,882 --> 01:09:33,679
<i>led by former NFL MVP quarterback</i>
<i>Paul Crewe. </i>

1002
01:09:38,714 --> 01:09:41,201
Holy shit. Hey, hey, hey.

1003
01:09:41,402 --> 01:09:42,962
Well, hello. How are you?

1004
01:09:43,162 --> 01:09:44,569
Back away from the girls!

1005
01:09:44,761 --> 01:09:46,801
-Hey, now.
-Call me!

1006
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:50,325
What the hell
are you dressed up for?

1007
01:09:50,521 --> 01:09:53,936
Hey, I didn't spend 14 years
in the joint just to watch this game.

1008
01:09:54,137 --> 01:09:55,860
<i>And there in the</i>
<i>high-security bleachers</i>

1009
01:09:56,057 --> 01:09:59,286
<i>are the good-behavior cons,</i>
<i>along with their... </i>

1010
01:09:59,482 --> 01:10:00,529
<i>... cheerleaders?</i>

1011
01:10:01,689 --> 01:10:03,631
<i>We're the mean machine</i>
<i>Don't mean to dis you</i>

1012
01:10:03,834 --> 01:10:06,321
<i>We're gonna kick your ass</i>
<i>And then we'll kiss you</i>

1013
01:10:06,714 --> 01:10:09,201
<i>Hey! Ho!</i>
<i>What?</i>

1014
01:10:11,929 --> 01:10:14,100
I didn't do it!

1015
01:10:24,698 --> 01:10:25,712
Come on, Batt!

1016
01:10:40,441 --> 01:10:42,351
-What's that?
-Did you see that?

1017
01:10:46,074 --> 01:10:47,088
Damn it!

1018
01:10:48,409 --> 01:10:52,086
<i>Papajohn's at the 20, the 10.</i>
<i>And he will score. </i>

1019
01:10:55,705 --> 01:10:57,713
Sweet dreams, bitch.

1020
01:10:58,361 --> 01:10:59,921
<i>That's a 90-yard return. </i>

1021
01:11:00,122 --> 01:11:03,667
And I gotta tell you, the cons seem
more interested in hitting the guards

1022
01:11:03,865 --> 01:11:05,523
than tackling the ball carrier.

1023
01:11:05,722 --> 01:11:10,424
Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.
Thanks for picking me up from school.

1024
01:11:11,545 --> 01:11:13,912
<i>And here comes the big story</i>
<i>of the day. </i>

1025
01:11:14,105 --> 01:11:16,375
<i>Paul Crewe,</i>
<i>serving a three-year sentence,</i>

1026
01:11:16,569 --> 01:11:19,798
<i>hasn't played since he was banned</i>
<i>from the NFL six years ago. </i>

1027
01:11:20,153 --> 01:11:23,001
Center, shift it! Shift it!

1028
01:11:26,617 --> 01:11:27,795
Hey, Sasquatch!

1029
01:11:31,577 --> 01:11:32,625
Twenty, hut!

1030
01:11:32,825 --> 01:11:35,891
<i>Crewe drops back to pass. </i>
<i>Turley's leaving him unprotected. </i>

1031
01:11:37,017 --> 01:11:38,675
Fumble!

1032
01:11:41,529 --> 01:11:42,609
Holy shit!

1033
01:11:44,601 --> 01:11:45,910
Goddamn it.

1034
01:11:46,105 --> 01:11:48,526
<i>That's gonna be a personal foul</i>
<i>on the big guy. </i>

1035
01:11:48,730 --> 01:11:51,413
<i>And this is certainly an inauspicious</i>
<i>start for the cons. </i>

1036
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:54,774
Come here! All right! You got him.
Now, protect me!

1037
01:11:55,225 --> 01:11:57,397
Let's go! Hold them!

1038
01:11:58,074 --> 01:12:02,264
<i>And here comes Knauer and that</i>
<i>big offensive unit for the guards. </i>

1039
01:12:06,905 --> 01:12:08,018
Eighty-six.

1040
01:12:08,313 --> 01:12:09,742
Back to your cell.

1041
01:12:11,193 --> 01:12:12,470
Hut! Hut!

1042
01:12:17,113 --> 01:12:20,823
<i>Knauer has Potter wide open. </i>
<i>Touchdown, guards. </i>

1043
01:12:22,201 --> 01:12:24,306
-Son of a bitch!
-<i>And in the first 90 seconds,</i>

1044
01:12:24,505 --> 01:12:26,610
<i>the guards are up</i>
<i>by two touchdowns. </i>

1045
01:12:26,809 --> 01:12:29,941
This one looks like
it could be over early.

1046
01:12:30,329 --> 01:12:31,573
Sorry.

1047
01:12:31,769 --> 01:12:34,552
What are we celebrating for?!
It's 14-nothing!

1048
01:12:34,745 --> 01:12:38,062
You guys wanna beat these assholes,
do it on the scoreboard!

1049
01:12:38,746 --> 01:12:42,259
Are you okay? Oh, God,
you're not hurt, are you?

1050
01:12:42,457 --> 01:12:44,083
Jesus, you sound like my mother.

1051
01:12:44,281 --> 01:12:48,689
Listen, if you wanna cry,
you go ahead and cry. I'll cry with you.

1052
01:12:48,889 --> 01:12:51,704
Get off me! Get back out there
and kick some ass!

1053
01:12:51,897 --> 01:12:54,864
Why are you yelling at me?
All I did was care!

1054
01:12:56,473 --> 01:13:00,019
Look! A broken leg will heal.

1055
01:13:00,217 --> 01:13:03,000
A loss to the Mean Machine
lasts forever.

1056
01:13:05,593 --> 01:13:06,520
Sorry, guys.

1057
01:13:07,065 --> 01:13:08,374
Yeah, yeah. Me too.

1058
01:13:10,041 --> 01:13:12,375
All right. Now, let's get started!

1059
01:13:14,649 --> 01:13:17,366
Now, get the hell out there! Let's go!

1060
01:13:30,201 --> 01:13:31,149
Way to go! Way to go!

1061
01:13:31,353 --> 01:13:33,971
<i>There's the first sign of life</i>
<i>from the cons. </i>

1062
01:13:34,169 --> 01:13:37,944
Let's see if Paul "Motley" Crewe
can make something happen.

1063
01:13:38,137 --> 01:13:39,064
Hut!

1064
01:13:39,257 --> 01:13:42,967
<i>On first down, Crewe will throw. </i>
<i>He's got Deacon wide open. </i>

1065
01:13:44,634 --> 01:13:46,837
<i>That's gotta be pass interference. </i>

1066
01:13:47,033 --> 01:13:48,789
<i>But the ref is waving it off. </i>

1067
01:13:48,985 --> 01:13:50,959
-What?!
-Oh, come on!

1068
01:13:51,161 --> 01:13:53,528
Come on, now. I'm in this hellhole
for less than that.

1069
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:56,307
-Be a man and make a call.
-You're right.

1070
01:13:56,505 --> 01:13:58,961
Unsportsmanlike conduct!
Eighty-eight black!

1071
01:13:59,161 --> 01:14:00,339
What?!

1072
01:14:01,273 --> 01:14:02,353
Come on!

1073
01:14:04,249 --> 01:14:05,809
This is baby-back bullshit!

1074
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:07,733
-Bullshit, D.
-Calm down. Let it go.

1075
01:14:08,057 --> 01:14:10,839
Let's call that one
a questionable call.

1076
01:14:11,225 --> 01:14:12,686

01:14:28,985 --> 01:14:31,025
-You're not gonna call that?
-I saw a clean tackle, sir.

1082
01:14:31,225 --> 01:14:33,079
What you looking at?
Are you serious?

1083
01:14:33,273 --> 01:14:35,346
Tell it to the parole board, criminal.

1084
01:14:35,897 --> 01:14:37,523
I mean, this is absurd.

1085
01:14:37,721 --> 01:14:40,023
We can't win with the refs
on the payroll!

1086
01:14:40,217 --> 01:14:43,119
Listen up. I got an idea
to end all this bullshit.

1087
01:14:43,321 --> 01:14:45,557
Come on, let's all stay up! Come on!

1088
01:14:47,353 --> 01:14:48,727
Down, set!

1089
01:14:49,017 --> 01:14:50,129
Red 58.

1090
01:14:50,329 --> 01:14:51,605
Cover your man!

1091
01:14:52,025 --> 01:14:53,847
Red 58. Hut!

1092
01:15:04,857 --> 01:15:07,246
That one hurt my marble sack.

1093
01:15:09,625 --> 01:15:10,552
All right!

1094
01:15:10,745 --> 01:15:12,468
-You all right?
-Yeah.

1095
01:15:12,665 --> 01:15:14,072
-What down is it?
-Fifth.

1096
01:15:14,265 --> 01:15:16,370
-No, no. It would be fourth down.
-Okay.

1097
01:15:20,281 --> 01:15:23,347
What do you think?
Should I go for the left nut this time?

1098
01:15:23,833 --> 01:15:25,840
Underneath! Let's go!

1099
01:15:26,041 --> 01:15:27,864
Ref, you gotta get in the game!
Right over here!

1100
01:15:28,057 --> 01:15:32,116
<i>Well, I don't quite get this, but on fourth</i>
<i>and 22, the cons are gonna go for it. </i>

1101
01:15:32,313 --> 01:15:33,774
Down, set!

1102
01:15:33,977 --> 01:15:35,383
Red 58.

1103
01:15:35,577 --> 01:15:37,039
Red 58. Hut!

1104
01:15:45,945 --> 01:15:48,367
You gotta always protect
the McNuggets.

1105
01:15:51,705 --> 01:15:54,356
How about from now on, you call
a fair game? How's that sound?

1106
01:15:54,713 --> 01:15:55,661
Sounds good.

1107
01:15:55,865 --> 01:15:57,719
Okay. Wet Willie.

1108
01:15:59,065 --> 01:16:00,374
Yeah, you like that.

1109
01:16:04,409 --> 01:16:06,132
<i>And so the guards will take over</i>

1110
01:16:06,329 --> 01:16:09,645
<i>after one of the strangest</i>
<i>offensive series I've ever seen. </i>

1111
01:16:09,977 --> 01:16:12,912
Okay, boys. We know who doesn't
have any balls out there now.

1112
01:16:13,113 --> 01:16:15,502
Have we got any?
Have we got some balls?

1113
01:16:15,705 --> 01:16:19,088
-Yeah!
-All right! Let's go kick some ass!

1114
01:16:19,513 --> 01:16:22,033
Come on, Swit, stand them up, baby.

1115
01:16:22,233 --> 01:16:25,844
White 50. White 50. Hut, hut, hut!

1116
01:16:26,041 --> 01:16:28,375
<i>Knauer, play action. </i>
<i>Here comes the blitz. </i>

1117
01:16:31,129 --> 01:16:34,707
<i>Switowski is so big, it's like being</i>
<i>tackled by a Coke machine with legs. </i>

1118
01:16:35,225 --> 01:16:36,751
This is fun!

1119
01:16:38,585 --> 01:16:40,145
Nice to see you smiling, Bob.

1120
01:16:40,889 --> 01:16:42,263
Thanks, Chris.

1121
01:16:43,704 --> 01:16:45,133
Green 90! Hut!

1122
01:16:45,465 --> 01:16:47,669
<i>Third and 5,</i>
<i>and the give is to Megget. </i>

1123
01:16:47,865 --> 01:16:50,286
<i>He's to the 40,</i>
<i>where he'll come up short. </i>

1124
01:16:50,521 --> 01:16:53,009
<i>But look at Turley push the pile. </i>

1125
01:16:53,209 --> 01:16:54,452
<i>And now Crewe. </i>

1126
01:16:55,353 --> 01:16:57,011
And that's a first down!

1127
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:01,653
<i>And look out. Boy, somebody better</i>
<i>take control of this game soon,</i>

1128
01:17:01,849 --> 01:17:03,921
<i>or they're gonna need body bags</i>
<i>on the sidelines. </i>

1129
01:17:04,121 --> 01:17:05,103
Let's go, guys.

1130
01:17:05,305 --> 01:17:06,385
<i>Start of the second quarter. </i>

1131
01:17:06,585 --> 01:17:09,487
<i>Cons still down by two touchdowns,</i>
<i>but they finally have some momentum. </i>

1132
01:17:09,689 --> 01:17:10,998
Hut!

1133
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:15,442
<i>Crewe with a shovel pass to Megget. </i>

1134
01:17:16,217 --> 01:17:18,356
<i>And Megget scrambles</i>
<i>for a first down. </i>

1135
01:17:19,129 --> 01:17:20,438
Oh, you fooled me.

1136
01:17:20,633 --> 01:17:22,455
-I got you there, didn't I?
-You did.

1137
01:17:22,649 --> 01:17:25,071
You know, Engleheart, you are
the best-looking guy on your team.

1138
01:17:25,273 --> 01:17:29,616
You know, Paul, in the midst of all this,
for you to say something like that is...

1139
01:17:30,489 --> 01:17:31,798
Come on, let's go. Let's go, D.

1140
01:17:31,993 --> 01:17:34,033
<i>First and 10 at the guards' 35.</i>

1141
01:17:34,232 --> 01:17:37,015
<i>Crewe dumps it over the middle</i>
<i>to Deacon Moss. </i>

1142
01:17:37,273 --> 01:17:42,193
<i>And he's hammered at the 17 for a</i>
<i>13-yard pickup, and that's a first down. </i>

1143
01:17:42,777 --> 01:17:44,435
-Hut!
-<i>Crewe, trying to get his team</i>

1144
01:17:44,633 --> 01:17:46,040
<i>on the scoreboard. </i>

1145
01:17:46,712 --> 01:17:48,207
<i>He will throw. </i>

1146
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:53,047
<i>And it's caught by Deacon Moss</i>
<i>for a touchdown!</i>

1147
01:17:54,329 --> 01:17:55,257
All right!

1148
01:17:55,449 --> 01:17:59,279
<i>And so there'll be no shutout today,</i>
<i>as the cons are on the board. </i>

1149
01:17:59,833 --> 01:18:02,964
Quit booing, people.
Both teams are trying very hard!

1150
01:18:03,384 --> 01:18:06,516
What the hell's wrong with you?
Stop acting like a damn cheerleader!

1151
01:18:06,713 --> 01:18:08,753
-Sportsmanship, try it.
-Shut up.

1152
01:18:12,185 --> 01:18:13,559
Damn.

1153
01:18:13,753 --> 01:18:16,786
<i>2:11 left in the first half. </i>
<i>And Dunham is back in at fullback. </i>

1154
01:18:16,985 --> 01:18:19,734
<i>And he is a load, at 6'2", 260.</i>

1155
01:18:22,105 --> 01:18:24,047
<i>Dunham, breaking tackles. </i>

1156
01:18:24,249 --> 01:18:25,907
<i>He refuses to go down. </i>

1157
01:18:26,553 --> 01:18:30,197
<i>But he finally does</i>
<i>after a 15-yard gain. </i>

1158
01:18:31,673 --> 01:18:33,746
That's how a white man
runs a football.

1159
01:18:33,945 --> 01:18:36,629
If I was on D, I'd crack you square
in that egg-ass head of yours.

1160
01:18:36,825 --> 01:18:39,509
Yeah, but you ain't on D.
Are you, bitch?

1161
01:18:40,953 --> 01:18:43,157
Switowski! Come here.

1162
01:18:43,641 --> 01:18:45,681
Do you know what
he said to me in the library?

1163
01:18:49,305 --> 01:18:51,923
Yes. Him. Out.

1164
01:18:55,257 --> 01:18:58,104
<i>D, D, defense</i>
<i>D, D, defense</i>

1165
01:18:58,297 --> 01:19:00,402
<i>The cons don't seem to have</i>
<i>an answer for Dunham,</i>

1166
01:19:00,601 --> 01:19:04,016
<i>who's averaging close to 12 yards</i>
<i>a carry this half. </i>

1167
01:19:05,593 --> 01:19:06,672
Green 67.

1168
01:19:06,873 --> 01:19:08,661
Green 67. Hut!

1169
01:19:12,408 --> 01:19:15,507
<i>Oh, what a hit on Dunham</i>
<i>by Switowski. </i>

1170
01:19:18,009 --> 01:19:20,278
I think I made him shit himself.

1171
01:19:20,536 --> 01:19:22,511
-Shit!
-I think he just shit himself.

1172
01:19:22,905 --> 01:19:25,010
I think he just shit himself.

1173
01:19:25,209 --> 01:19:28,591
Good Lord.
This guy shit himself bigtime.

1174
01:19:28,793 --> 01:19:31,989
See? I told you
I made him shit himself!

1175
01:19:32,729 --> 01:19:35,478
Yo! I'll make sure I send
them books to the hospital, pimp.

1176
01:19:35,673 --> 01:19:37,266
And some diapers.

1177
01:19:38,841 --> 01:19:41,459
Nineteen seconds.
We got a lot of ground to cover.

1178
01:19:41,656 --> 01:19:43,893
So you bastards remember
that play we practiced in the mud?

1179
01:19:44,088 --> 01:19:46,805
What are you talking about?
That was some schoolyard bullshit.

1180
01:19:47,001 --> 01:19:49,870
Yeah. Let's try some
schoolyard bullshit.

1181
01:19:51,705 --> 01:19:53,047
Come on, D, let's go.

1182
01:19:53,241 --> 01:19:56,023
Down, set! Green 88.

1183
01:19:56,345 --> 01:19:57,621
Green 88. Hut!

1184
01:19:57,817 --> 01:20:02,356
<i>The clock starts to run. Crewe hands</i>
<i>the ball to Megget. It's a reverse. </i>

1185
01:20:02,649 --> 01:20:04,623
<i>Cheeseburger Eddy's got it. </i>

1186
01:20:04,825 --> 01:20:06,450
Go, baby, go!

1187
01:20:07,032 --> 01:20:08,942
<i>He laterals to Deacon. </i>

1188
01:20:10,104 --> 01:20:11,413
Tackle him!

1189
01:20:12,632 --> 01:20:13,777
<i>To Turley. </i>

1190
01:20:13,977 --> 01:20:16,530
<i>The clock is running. To Brucie. </i>

1191
01:20:16,728 --> 01:20:18,670
<i>Shades of Cal-Stanford. </i>

1192
01:20:18,873 --> 01:20:20,302
<i>Back to Crewe. </i>

1193
01:20:21,016 --> 01:20:22,674
<i>He tosses to Megget. </i>

1194
01:20:22,873 --> 01:20:23,855
Tackle him!

1195
01:20:27,577 --> 01:20:30,294
<i>And look at that little Megget run. </i>

1196
01:20:30,489 --> 01:20:32,147
<i>Three seconds left. </i>

1197
01:20:33,369 --> 01:20:34,351
Yeah! Go!

1198
01:20:35,416 --> 01:20:40,370
<i>He could go all the way. Touchdown!</i>

1199
01:20:45,721 --> 01:20:46,801
Did you see that?!

1200
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,310
Do that sound again.

1201
01:20:50,232 --> 01:20:51,476
I like that.

1202
01:20:54,424 --> 01:20:56,628
<i>And so, on a miraculous play,</i>

1203
01:20:56,825 --> 01:21:00,600
<i>the cons end the first half</i>
<i>with the score: 14-all. </i>

1204
01:21:05,432 --> 01:21:07,090
Bring it in.

1205
01:21:07,801 --> 01:21:10,998
Do you have any idea
who's beating you out there?

1206
01:21:11,192 --> 01:21:13,265
This was supposed to be a blowout,

1207
01:21:13,464 --> 01:21:16,781
and they're showing you up
in front of the whole nation.

1208
01:21:17,816 --> 01:21:19,377
The whole nation!

1209
01:21:19,769 --> 01:21:21,874
I like it when he's angry.

1210
01:21:24,057 --> 01:21:26,610
-I told you!
-Way to go, baby, way to go.

1211
01:21:32,728 --> 01:21:35,478
What in the hell do you think
you're doing out there?

1212
01:21:35,673 --> 01:21:37,233
Playing football, sir.

1213
01:21:38,873 --> 01:21:40,629
I didn't say nothing about winning.

1214
01:21:40,952 --> 01:21:43,091
We're not winning. Not yet.

1215
01:21:46,073 --> 01:21:48,439
You got yourself in quite
a predicament, Mr. Crewe.

1216
01:21:48,632 --> 01:21:50,999
-Is that right?
-See, it's just come to my attention

1217
01:21:51,193 --> 01:21:53,168
that inmate Unger
has been taken into custody

1218
01:21:53,369 --> 01:21:54,776
for the murder of Caretaker.

1219
01:21:54,969 --> 01:21:57,238
-Good.
-Oh, yeah, it's good.

1220
01:21:57,688 --> 01:22:00,918
Only thing is, he claims
to have an accomplice.

1221
01:22:01,337 --> 01:22:03,027
Claims you knew all about it.

1222
01:22:03,225 --> 01:22:06,291
Hell, he even says
you sent Caretaker to your cell.

1223
01:22:07,384 --> 01:22:08,562
Bullshit.

1224
01:22:08,761 --> 01:22:11,827
Captain Knauer says
he saw you planning it with Unger.

1225
01:22:13,177 --> 01:22:14,803
There's no way
that could hold up in court.

1226
01:22:15,001 --> 01:22:15,950
Court?

1227
01:22:17,753 --> 01:22:21,943
Hell, boy, in Allenville,
I'm the judge, I'm the jury,

1228
01:22:22,136 --> 01:22:26,130
and in your particular case,
I'm the executioner.

1229
01:22:26,969 --> 01:22:27,951
What do you want?

1230
01:22:28,473 --> 01:22:30,033
I want you to lose.

1231
01:22:30,232 --> 01:22:31,345
I can't do that.

1232
01:22:31,544 --> 01:22:34,414
Of course you can. After all,
you've had plenty of practice.

1233
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:37,912
But the men. It's more important
to them than it is to you.

1234
01:22:39,097 --> 01:22:41,072
Okay. Suit yourself.

1235
01:22:41,432 --> 01:22:44,727
Spend the next 25 years
of your useless life in prison.

1236
01:22:46,873 --> 01:22:48,531
All right, I'll do it.

1237
01:22:52,377 --> 01:22:56,054
But I don't want my guys hurt.
You get ahead, you coast. We clear?

1238
01:22:56,248 --> 01:22:58,834
Fine. Right after I get
a two-touchdown lead.

1239
01:23:00,344 --> 01:23:02,995
I tell you what bothers me
the most, warden.

1240
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,731
That you're not gonna be
out there on that field with us,

1241
01:23:07,929 --> 01:23:09,685
getting what you got coming to you.

1242
01:23:12,664 --> 01:23:15,381
The only thing coming to me
is victory.

1243
01:23:17,464 --> 01:23:18,839
Mean Machine.

1244
01:23:20,377 --> 01:23:21,555
It's cute.

1245
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:26,259
-Let's go, boy!
-We can do it, baby!

1246
01:23:26,456 --> 01:23:27,885
Captain.

1247
01:23:28,792 --> 01:23:30,134
May I have a word?

1248
01:23:30,329 --> 01:23:32,718
Don't worry, warden,
we'll take care of business.

1249
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:34,000
I already have.

1250
01:23:34,425 --> 01:23:36,945
What? We can win this on our own.

1251
01:23:37,145 --> 01:23:41,039
Captain, a man in my position
doesn't leave things to chance.

1252
01:23:41,753 --> 01:23:44,753
Now, after you get a comfortable
three-touchdown lead,

1253
01:23:44,952 --> 01:23:47,669
I want you to inflict as much pain
as humanly possible.

1254
01:23:47,865 --> 01:23:49,970
Do not let up, you hear?

1255
01:23:50,329 --> 01:23:53,111
I want those cons to understand
who owns them.

1256
01:23:53,944 --> 01:23:55,188
Do I make myself clear?

1257
01:23:55,385 --> 01:23:56,629
Oh, yes, sir.

1258
01:23:57,401 --> 01:23:58,328
Good.

1259
01:23:59,192 --> 01:24:02,541
<i>There's the kickoff, and we're</i>
<i>under way in the second half. </i>

1260
01:24:08,056 --> 01:24:11,024
<i>Megget is finally brought down</i>
<i>at the guards' 33,</i>

1261
01:24:11,224 --> 01:24:12,751
<i>where Paul Crewe will take over. </i>

1262
01:24:12,952 --> 01:24:14,676
<i>And what a first half he's had. </i>

1263
01:24:14,872 --> 01:24:16,083
Here we go! Here we go!

1264
01:24:19,129 --> 01:24:20,372
Down, set!

1265
01:24:21,113 --> 01:24:23,153
Y 45. Hut!

1266
01:24:24,025 --> 01:24:26,391
<i>On first and 10, Crewe will pass. </i>

1267
01:24:26,584 --> 01:24:28,210
-<i>He's got Deacon wide open. </i>
-Come on.

1268
01:24:28,408 --> 01:24:29,521
<i>Oh, incomplete. </i>

1269
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:30,768
It's okay. Get your head up.

1270
01:24:31,321 --> 01:24:32,248
It's all right, man.

1271
01:24:34,168 --> 01:24:35,346
Come on, Paulie.

1272
01:24:35,545 --> 01:24:38,676
<i>Second and 10 from the 33. Crewe's</i>
<i>looking for Deacon once again. </i>

1273
01:24:38,872 --> 01:24:40,945
-He's open!
-He's open!

1274
01:24:41,592 --> 01:24:45,334
<i>But overthrows it. </i>
<i>And it's picked off by Papajohn. </i>

1275
01:24:45,528 --> 01:24:46,990
<i>Look out! He might go. </i>

1276
01:24:48,537 --> 01:24:50,130
<i>Say goodbye. </i>

1277
01:24:50,873 --> 01:24:51,821
<i>Touchdown!</i>

1278
01:24:53,816 --> 01:24:57,231
The first mistake
Crewe's made all day.

1279
01:25:00,153 --> 01:25:03,731
Short memory, baby.
We'll get it back. We'll get it back.

1280
01:25:03,928 --> 01:25:05,489
Defense, let's do this!

1281
01:25:06,648 --> 01:25:08,175
<i>8:38 left in the third quarter,</i>

1282
01:25:08,376 --> 01:25:10,286
<i>and Crewe has struggled</i>
<i>thus far in the second half. </i>

1283
01:25:10,488 --> 01:25:11,862
Hut!

1284
01:25:12,056 --> 01:25:15,351
<i>The pitch to Megget. </i>
<i>Oh, my! That ball is live!</i>

1285
01:25:16,344 --> 01:25:17,871
<i>It's picked up by Lambert. </i>

1286
01:25:18,072 --> 01:25:21,203
<i>He's at the 15, the 10,</i>
<i>and he will score!</i>

1287
01:25:22,841 --> 01:25:24,531
Yeah! Touchdown! Yeah!

1288
01:25:24,729 --> 01:25:28,755
<i>Crewe took a shot on that play</i>
<i>and he's getting up slowly. </i>

1289
01:25:28,952 --> 01:25:32,248
<i>Meanwhile, in the end zone, the guards</i>
<i>have something to celebrate,</i>

1290
01:25:32,441 --> 01:25:34,829
<i>as they find themselves up</i>
<i>by two touchdowns. </i>

1291
01:25:35,033 --> 01:25:38,448
<i>This is simply a different Paul Crewe</i>
<i>we're seeing here in the second half. </i>

1292
01:25:38,648 --> 01:25:41,037
There's the old Paul Crewe
we love to write about.

1293
01:25:41,241 --> 01:25:42,899
What the hell are you
doing out there?

1294
01:25:43,096 --> 01:25:44,525
I'm done.

1295
01:25:45,785 --> 01:25:47,192
I'm out. That's it.

1296
01:25:49,496 --> 01:25:51,187
-Where you hurting?
-My knee.

1297
01:25:51,384 --> 01:25:53,326
-Seems okay to me.
-Well, it ain't.

1298
01:25:55,897 --> 01:25:59,574
If Crewe can't go, I don't know how
deep these guys are at quarterback.

1299
01:26:01,561 --> 01:26:04,856
<i>The guards will try to keep it away</i>
<i>from Megget, so they'll pooch kick. </i>

1300
01:26:05,049 --> 01:26:06,259
Fair catch. Fair catch.

1301
01:26:06,457 --> 01:26:08,944
<i>As Big Tony calls for the fair catch. </i>

1302
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:12,913
<i>Watch out. That was as late a hit</i>
<i>as I've ever seen. </i>

1303
01:26:14,616 --> 01:26:18,261
<i>And even some of the home crowd</i>
<i>not liking that one. </i>

1304
01:26:18,456 --> 01:26:19,471
Hang in there, partner.

1305
01:26:19,672 --> 01:26:23,502
Can of corn. Can of corn,
and I'll be fine. Can of corn.

1306
01:26:26,488 --> 01:26:28,593
Yeah, I'd have a hard time
looking at me too.

1307
01:26:29,145 --> 01:26:30,225
Brucie.

1308
01:26:30,424 --> 01:26:31,471
Yeah, coach.

1309
01:26:31,673 --> 01:26:34,989
You're the only one that knows
this offense, son. Now, do it.

1310
01:26:35,192 --> 01:26:37,462
<i>Coming into the game,</i>
<i>replacing the injured Paul Crewe,</i>

1311
01:26:37,656 --> 01:26:38,933
<i>is number 1, Brucie. </i>

1312
01:26:39,128 --> 01:26:40,884
All right, all right.
Crewe's playing like shit.

1313
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:43,087
That's his problem.
I'm gonna bring us back.

1314
01:26:43,289 --> 01:26:45,558
Right, 32 Flex Dive Motion
on one. Ready!

1315
01:26:45,752 --> 01:26:46,680
Break!

1316
01:26:46,873 --> 01:26:49,360
Yeah. It's Brucie's
time to shine, baby.

1317
01:26:49,913 --> 01:26:52,302
Okay. Down, set. Hut!

1318
01:26:52,504 --> 01:26:56,246
<i>There's the snap and the ball is</i>
<i>fumbled. And the guards recover. </i>

1319
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:58,066
I knew I shouldn't
have had that popcorn.

1320
01:26:59,192 --> 01:27:02,804
The guards are in command here
as we move late into the third quarter.

1321
01:27:03,001 --> 01:27:04,310
Ninety-eight. Hut! Hut!

1322
01:27:05,273 --> 01:27:08,175
<i>The give is to Potter. </i>
<i>Back to Knauer. </i>

1323
01:27:08,376 --> 01:27:10,547
<i>He's got a man open</i>
<i>deep downfield. </i>

1324
01:27:10,744 --> 01:27:12,599
<i>He'll throw the flea-flicker!</i>

1325
01:27:12,793 --> 01:27:15,345
<i>And he's got it. Touchdown, guards. </i>

1326
01:27:15,544 --> 01:27:18,479
<i>And this game is starting</i>
<i>to look like a blowout. </i>

1327
01:27:20,473 --> 01:27:24,401
Hey, man, after all Caretaker did,
this is how you show him love?

1328
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:25,909
Don't worry about it.

1329
01:27:26,104 --> 01:27:28,275
You haven't changed one damn bit.

1330
01:27:32,568 --> 01:27:34,226
All right. Down, set!

1331
01:27:34,425 --> 01:27:35,602
<i>Back in at quarterback is Brucie,</i>

1332
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:38,517
<i>who will try to find a handle</i>
<i>on the ball this time. </i>

1333
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:40,850
Throw it, Brucie!

1334
01:27:41,368 --> 01:27:42,775
Oh, shit!

1335
01:27:43,096 --> 01:27:44,438
<i>And look out. </i>

1336
01:27:48,312 --> 01:27:50,287
<i>What a shot he took!</i>

1337
01:27:50,584 --> 01:27:51,894
How much more blood do you want?

1338
01:27:54,937 --> 01:27:58,482
<i>I think the cons are just about</i>
<i>out of options at quarterback. </i>

1339
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:19,120
Hey, Skitchy,
let me ask you something.

1340
01:28:19,992 --> 01:28:22,775
When you popped the warden,
was it worth it?

1341
01:28:22,968 --> 01:28:25,008
Was it worth spending
the rest of your life in here?

1342
01:28:25,688 --> 01:28:29,365
Was it worth it? It was worth
every goddamn second.

1343
01:28:37,016 --> 01:28:38,740
What the hell is he doing?

1344
01:28:41,529 --> 01:28:45,009
Paul Crewe must be feeling better,
because here he comes.

1345
01:28:45,209 --> 01:28:47,478
All right, I missed you guys,
so I'm back.

1346
01:28:47,672 --> 01:28:49,844
We got a lot of work to do.
Let's get it going.

1347
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:52,528
Deuce right, 89. Fly on two. Ready?

1348
01:28:54,776 --> 01:28:55,791
Break.

1349
01:28:57,304 --> 01:29:00,206
<i>As we start the fourth quarter,</i>
<i>cons down by three touchdowns. </i>

1350
01:29:00,408 --> 01:29:01,652
Wide left! Tight left!

1351
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:05,262
Black 90. Hut! Hut!

1352
01:29:05,464 --> 01:29:07,920
<i>Here comes the blitz,</i>
<i>and no one's blocking!</i>

1353
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:10,989
<i>And Crewe will be sacked</i>
<i>for a big loss. </i>

1354
01:29:11,641 --> 01:29:15,503
<i>That looked like a message to Crewe</i>
<i>from his offensive line. </i>

1355
01:29:17,112 --> 01:29:18,770
Did you see that, man?
They're quitting on him.

1356
01:29:18,969 --> 01:29:20,878
Okay, baby. Jailbreak Blitz. Ready?

1357
01:29:21,208 --> 01:29:23,248
We got that out of the way.
I deserved it.

1358
01:29:23,448 --> 01:29:25,717
-Now we gotta play some football.
-Switch it! Switch it!

1359
01:29:25,912 --> 01:29:27,919
<i>Cons need to do something</i>
<i>to get back in this game. </i>

1360
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:29,876
<i>And that's not it!</i>

1361
01:29:30,648 --> 01:29:32,557
<i>And Crewe is leveled!</i>

1362
01:29:32,761 --> 01:29:34,964
I don't think he's gonna get up
from that one.

1363
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:36,567
Nice hit!

1364
01:29:38,392 --> 01:29:40,880
<i>But he is. And I don't know how,</i>
<i>after that last hit. </i>

1365
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:42,160
All right, punt team!

1366
01:29:42,361 --> 01:29:44,630
Keep them off the field!
We're going for it.

1367
01:29:44,824 --> 01:29:46,613
Dumbshits are going for it!
Let's go! Let's go!

1368
01:29:46,968 --> 01:29:49,783
Come on back, if he wants to get
his ass kicked. Come on back.

1369
01:29:49,976 --> 01:29:51,187
<i>This is unbelievable. </i>

1370
01:29:51,384 --> 01:29:55,378
Fine. You guys don't wanna help me,
I'll do it on my own. On two.

1371
01:29:56,344 --> 01:29:57,522
Let's go, to the line.

1372
01:29:57,721 --> 01:29:58,997
<i>On fourth and 20,</i>

1373
01:29:59,192 --> 01:30:01,875
<i>the cons are gonna go for it. </i>
<i>This could be the ball game right here. </i>

1374
01:30:02,072 --> 01:30:04,046
Red 98. Hut! Hut!

1375
01:30:05,592 --> 01:30:09,138
<i>Crewe dodges the blitz,</i>
<i>but he loses his helmet. </i>

1376
01:30:12,473 --> 01:30:13,934
<i>And he's not going down. </i>

1377
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:21,491
<i>He's got the first down. </i>

1378
01:30:21,688 --> 01:30:22,866
Time-out!

1379
01:30:23,544 --> 01:30:25,137
-Man, oh, man.
-Not bad.

1380
01:30:32,408 --> 01:30:33,586
Huddle up.

1381
01:30:34,648 --> 01:30:35,597
Look.

1382
01:30:36,664 --> 01:30:39,981
I'm sure you already know this,
but I never said it out loud.

1383
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:43,091
I did throw that game.

1384
01:30:44,472 --> 01:30:45,716
I did it.

1385
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:49,237
I was in a bad way
with some worse people.

1386
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:51,317
After I did it,

1387
01:30:51,512 --> 01:30:55,374
I felt so shitty I wish I would have
just let them kill me instead.

1388
01:30:56,024 --> 01:31:00,214
Now the warden wants to pin
Caretaker's murder on me

1389
01:31:00,408 --> 01:31:02,263
if I don't throw this game.

1390
01:31:04,024 --> 01:31:06,391
So it looks like I'm gonna get
to know you guys a lot better,

1391
01:31:06,584 --> 01:31:09,105
because I ain't doing that
twice in a lifetime.

1392
01:31:09,304 --> 01:31:12,370
We got a little time left.
We can still do this.

1393
01:31:12,568 --> 01:31:15,535
I'm begging you.
Put your hands in here.

1394
01:31:24,888 --> 01:31:27,822
Okay. Thank you. Now, who are we?

1395
01:31:28,024 --> 01:31:29,006
Mean Machine!

1396
01:31:29,208 --> 01:31:31,477
Come on, Mean Machine, let's go!

1397
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:35,891
That's great news.

1398
01:31:36,088 --> 01:31:38,739
All right. We got ourselves a game.

1399
01:31:38,936 --> 01:31:40,463
Brown 65. Hut!

1400
01:31:40,664 --> 01:31:44,559
<i>First and 10 from the 30.</i>
<i>Crewe finds Deacon open in the flat. </i>

1401
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:47,511
Hut!

1402
01:31:49,144 --> 01:31:51,893
<i>The give is to Megget. And he fights</i>
<i>his way for a 9-yard gain. </i>

1403
01:31:52,088 --> 01:31:53,714
One yard, baby. One more yard.

1404
01:31:55,064 --> 01:31:56,046
Hut! Hut!

1405
01:31:56,248 --> 01:31:58,158
<i>Crewe tries a sneak. Or is it?</i>

1406
01:31:58,360 --> 01:31:59,767
<i>He flips it back to Megget. </i>

1407
01:32:00,248 --> 01:32:03,151
<i>Megget's got the first down</i>
<i>and more. </i>

1408
01:32:10,232 --> 01:32:14,029
<i>And Megget is down to the 4-yard</i>
<i>line, where it'll be first and goal. </i>

1409
01:32:14,232 --> 01:32:15,280
Hut!

1410
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:19,760
<i>Crewe hands it to Turley. </i>
<i>And look at the big man go. </i>

1411
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:21,137
Tackle him!

1412
01:32:26,648 --> 01:32:27,663
<i>Touchdown!</i>

1413
01:32:28,728 --> 01:32:32,787
That was some rumbling, bumbling
stumbling right there.

1414
01:32:32,984 --> 01:32:34,675
<i>And listen to the crowd</i>

1415
01:32:34,872 --> 01:32:38,385
<i>as this underdog con team</i>
<i>is starting to win them over. </i>

1416
01:32:46,136 --> 01:32:49,583
<i>Third down and 6. Guards have</i>
<i>the ball on their own 29-yard line. </i>

1417
01:32:49,784 --> 01:32:52,151
<i>Knauer needs a first down</i>
<i>to put this game away. </i>

1418
01:32:52,344 --> 01:32:53,750
White 50!

1419
01:32:54,328 --> 01:32:55,342
White 50!

1420
01:32:55,544 --> 01:32:57,616
<i>And look at Battle take off. </i>

1421
01:32:58,968 --> 01:33:00,375
<i>He knocks the ball loose!</i>

1422
01:33:01,592 --> 01:33:05,967
<i>There's a dogpile in the backfield. </i>
<i>The refs are trying to sort it out. </i>

1423
01:33:08,568 --> 01:33:10,128
My arm!

1424
01:33:10,968 --> 01:33:12,975
<i>The cons recover!</i>

1425
01:33:13,592 --> 01:33:16,309
We got the ball! We got the ball!
We got it! We got it!

1426
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:21,335
With just over two minutes left to be
played, this has turned into a game.

1427
01:33:21,688 --> 01:33:25,266
<i>Crewe will start in great field position</i>
<i>at the guards' 25.</i>

1428
01:33:25,464 --> 01:33:28,912
<i>And look at this formation. </i>
<i>The guards, they're confused. </i>

1429
01:33:29,112 --> 01:33:30,127
Shift over! Move!

1430
01:33:30,328 --> 01:33:32,499
<i>They're trying to call time-out,</i>
<i>but there's the snap. </i>

1431
01:33:36,216 --> 01:33:39,598
<i>Moss is behind a wall of cons. I</i>
<i>wouldn't wanna be in front of that thing. </i>

1432
01:33:42,712 --> 01:33:44,054
<i>And they'll score!</i>

1433
01:33:49,016 --> 01:33:51,504
-Hey! Is that legal?
-Yeah, it is.

1434
01:33:51,704 --> 01:33:53,460
-Is that a touchdown?
-Yes, it is.

1435
01:33:53,656 --> 01:33:56,405
What is going on here? Shit!

1436
01:33:56,888 --> 01:33:59,954
<i>And with the extra point,</i>
<i>the cons are down by just seven. </i>

1437
01:34:07,128 --> 01:34:09,331
-Brucie!
-Yeah. Yeah, coach.

1438
01:34:09,848 --> 01:34:11,790
I want you to go out there
and kick off.

1439
01:34:11,992 --> 01:34:13,814
-I can do it.
-Kick off!

1440
01:34:14,232 --> 01:34:15,956
Brucie can't kick worth a shit.

1441
01:34:16,152 --> 01:34:18,836
I know. Recover the ball.

1442
01:34:19,224 --> 01:34:21,973
Jesus Christ, my savior.
If you help me out with this one,

1443
01:34:22,168 --> 01:34:25,517
I promise to stop cheating on my wife
with black guys. Amen.

1444
01:34:25,719 --> 01:34:27,792
<i>Back in the game is Brucie,</i>
<i>and he'll do the honors. </i>

1445
01:34:27,991 --> 01:34:29,518
<i>And it's a horrible kick. </i>

1446
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:31,149
<i>But the ball is tipped!</i>

1447
01:34:32,024 --> 01:34:34,446
<i>And the cons have come up with it!</i>

1448
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:38,007
-We got it! One time-out.
-Got it. Got it.

1449
01:34:38,199 --> 01:34:41,495
That's it, Brucie. Hey, hey!
My bad. My bad. My bad. Come on.

1450
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:44,269
Give me that.

1451
01:34:45,208 --> 01:34:46,223
Damn...

1452
01:34:47,672 --> 01:34:49,843
Well, that felt unnecessary.

1453
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:52,691
<i>Cons have enough time</i>
<i>for one final drive. </i>

1454
01:34:53,752 --> 01:34:55,956
<i>Crewe drops back to pass. </i>
<i>He's under pressure. </i>

1455
01:34:56,183 --> 01:34:58,671
-Watch the pass!
-<i>He's looking for Deacon. </i>

1456
01:34:58,872 --> 01:35:00,530
<i>He gets the ball up, but he's leveled. </i>

1457
01:35:01,496 --> 01:35:04,179
<i>And Deacon's got it for a first down,</i>
<i>but he stayed inbounds. </i>

1458
01:35:04,376 --> 01:35:06,230
<i>Tick, tick, tick. </i>
<i>The clock keeps running. </i>

1459
01:35:06,424 --> 01:35:09,293
Clock's running. Clock's still running!
Clock's still running!

1460
01:35:09,496 --> 01:35:10,444
On the ball!

1461
01:35:10,648 --> 01:35:12,557
Goddamn it! Do something!

1462
01:35:12,759 --> 01:35:13,742
Hut!

1463
01:35:14,552 --> 01:35:17,618
<i>Crewe. He's looking to throw. </i>
<i>Under pressure again. </i>

1464
01:35:17,816 --> 01:35:20,182
Go! Get rid of it! Go! Go!

1465
01:35:20,376 --> 01:35:22,481
<i>He pitches it to Megget. </i>
<i>He's got some room. </i>

1466
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:25,200
Here we go. Here we go.
Go, Megg! Go, Megget!

1467
01:35:25,688 --> 01:35:28,110
-Go, Megget!
-Get him!

1468
01:35:28,312 --> 01:35:30,614
<i>He could go all the way!</i>

1469
01:35:30,808 --> 01:35:31,985
<i>But he won't!</i>

1470
01:35:32,184 --> 01:35:33,231
Goddamn it!

1471
01:35:33,432 --> 01:35:35,766
<i>And Megget is hit hard</i>
<i>at the 4, and he's hurt. </i>

1472
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:37,269
My knee, man!

1473
01:35:39,512 --> 01:35:42,229
You busted your knee for us,
we'll bust our ass for you.

1474
01:35:42,424 --> 01:35:44,147
Hey, coach, I need a back!

1475
01:35:44,344 --> 01:35:45,587
Just win this shit.

1476
01:35:47,544 --> 01:35:48,820
I'm going in.

1477
01:35:49,016 --> 01:35:50,543
Coach, you serious?

1478
01:35:50,744 --> 01:35:52,238
Yeah, I'm serious.

1479
01:35:52,504 --> 01:35:54,893
<i>And look who's</i>

You can do it!

1481
01:35:57,304 --> 01:36:00,370
Get that old ass of yours
in the end zone!

1482
01:36:00,568 --> 01:36:02,957
We gotta win this thing! Come on!

1483
01:36:04,664 --> 01:36:07,314
No, no, no. Hey, old man.

1484
01:36:07,512 --> 01:36:09,421
Absolutely not.
You're gonna get killed out here.

1485
01:36:09,624 --> 01:36:12,471
They've been trying that for years.
Don't worry, I got the perfect play.

1486
01:36:12,664 --> 01:36:14,803
-I ain't handing you the ball.
-You don't have to.

01:38:11,319 --> 01:38:12,432
Are you serious?

1526
01:38:12,631 --> 01:38:14,224
I don't know. That play is wack.

1527
01:38:14,424 --> 01:38:15,438
It's gonna work.

1528
01:38:16,664 --> 01:38:18,769
It's gonna work. Let's go. On the ball.

1529
01:38:18,968 --> 01:38:19,916
Come on! Let's go!

1530
01:38:20,119 --> 01:38:22,029
Let's go, y'all! Let's go!

1531
01:38:22,231 --> 01:38:23,792
I think it's gonna work.

1532
01:38:24,855 --> 01:38:26,513
Get them out there.

1533
01:38:28,984 --> 01:38:31,918
<i>And wait a minute. </i>
<i>Crewe is coming back into the game. </i>

1534
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:33,843
<i>The cons are gonna go for the win. </i>

1535
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:35,055
They're going for it.

1536
01:38:36,279 --> 01:38:39,247
<i>Crewe, trying to settle his team</i>
<i>into formation. </i>

1537
01:38:39,448 --> 01:38:41,270
<i>But there seems to be</i>
<i>a lot of confusion. </i>

1538
01:38:41,464 --> 01:38:43,089
Come on! Run the play!

1539
01:38:43,288 --> 01:38:45,524
Turley! Turley. Over here.

1540
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:48,208
Move your giant ass right here!
Right here.

1541
01:38:48,407 --> 01:38:50,131
Come on, baby. Come on.

1542
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:54,579
<i>The play clock is still running. </i>
<i>Crewe better call a time-out. </i>

1543
01:38:54,775 --> 01:38:55,703
Come on, Crewe!

1544
01:38:57,624 --> 01:38:59,380
They don't know what we're doing!

1545
01:38:59,575 --> 01:39:01,069
Run the play we set up.

1546
01:39:01,272 --> 01:39:03,443
I think you're still dizzy from that hit!

1547
01:39:04,408 --> 01:39:06,295
<i>The snap is to Deacon. </i>

1548
01:39:06,488 --> 01:39:07,765
It's a trick.

1549
01:39:07,959 --> 01:39:09,901
<i>He throws it to Crewe. </i>

1550
01:39:32,471 --> 01:39:34,576
<i>They did it! Unbelievable!</i>

1551
01:39:34,776 --> 01:39:36,183
<i>The cons win!</i>

1552
01:39:49,208 --> 01:39:50,484
We win!

1553
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:53,462
Group hug in the shower tonight!

1554
01:39:55,415 --> 01:39:57,554
Or not. Or not.

1555
01:39:59,576 --> 01:40:00,820
<i>Well, there you have it. </i>

1556
01:40:01,015 --> 01:40:03,120
<i>A bunch of ruthless criminals</i>
<i>have beaten</i>

1557
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:05,775
<i>the men that uphold</i>
<i>our justice system. </i>

1558
01:40:05,975 --> 01:40:07,863
Criminals are people too, Chris.

1559
01:40:08,056 --> 01:40:09,332
Now, give me your wallet.

1560
01:40:09,911 --> 01:40:10,860
What?

1561
01:40:11,319 --> 01:40:12,912
Just kidding.

1562
01:40:16,856 --> 01:40:20,467
You got a lot of balls, Crewe.
You played a hell of a game.

1563
01:40:20,663 --> 01:40:24,340
And don't worry, I know you had
nothing to do with Caretaker's murder.

1564
01:40:24,536 --> 01:40:25,583
And I'll back that up.

1565
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:28,661
Thank you, baby.

1566
01:40:30,263 --> 01:40:32,685
<i>Mean Machine! Mean Machine!</i>

1567
01:40:35,639 --> 01:40:39,982
You humiliated me. I can't believe
you couldn't even win a fixed game.

1568
01:40:42,455 --> 01:40:44,822
Now, where the hell
does he think he's going?

1569
01:40:48,184 --> 01:40:49,329
He's escaping.

1570
01:40:49,719 --> 01:40:50,799
He's escaping.

1571
01:40:50,999 --> 01:40:53,007
Officer, shoot that man!

1572
01:40:53,207 --> 01:40:54,931
But, sir, there's people.

1573
01:40:56,599 --> 01:40:57,614
Shoot him.

1574
01:40:58,552 --> 01:40:59,534
Crewe!

1575
01:41:00,216 --> 01:41:02,704
Captain, I order you
to shoot that prisoner.

1576
01:41:05,847 --> 01:41:07,789
Shoot him! Fire!

1577
01:41:07,992 --> 01:41:09,268
Crewe!

1578
01:41:09,464 --> 01:41:12,279
Damn it, I'm giving you an order,
captain!

1579
01:41:12,471 --> 01:41:13,399
Crewe!

1580
01:41:13,592 --> 01:41:15,315
Pull the trigger!

1581
01:41:33,879 --> 01:41:36,050
It's the game ball.

1582
01:41:42,712 --> 01:41:43,759
Hey.

1583
01:41:47,512 --> 01:41:50,327
Why don't you stick this
in your trophy case.

1584
01:41:52,312 --> 01:41:54,450
-You have a nice time, old man?
-Yeah.

1585
01:41:54,647 --> 01:41:57,397
Yeah? Okay.
So, what do we do now?

1586
01:41:57,591 --> 01:42:00,112
Well, the first thing is, we tell the
team where they're hiding Unger.

1587
01:42:00,311 --> 01:42:03,606
Oh, I can't wait to see
what Switowski does to him.

1588
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:11,629
Great game, sir.

1589
01:42:14,392 --> 01:42:15,821
That's a week in the hotbox!

1590
01:42:16,023 --> 01:42:17,812
Who gives a shit?

1591
01:42:27,403 --> 01:42:30,088
