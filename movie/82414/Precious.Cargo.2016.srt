00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:43,501
Shit. Sorry, girl.

3
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:44,903
Final hole.

4
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:46,304
He birdies here,

5
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,607
he walks away
with the Green Jacket.

6
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,208
Fuck!

7
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,546
Wonderful.

8
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,366
You're late.

9
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,949
- The weapons?
- It's on the boat. The cash?

10
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:37,022
- Feels a little light.
- That's 45,000 now.

11
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:39,190
The rest you'll get wired
into an account of your choosing

12
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,092
- once we get the weapons.
- No, no, no!

13
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,428
This is bullshit!
This is not what we agreed on!

14
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,097
Hey, Pablo, Paco, Pepe,
whatever the fuck your name is.

15
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,399
Leave the weapons on the boat.

16
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:54,940
Okay. Fine.

17
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:57,409
You want to play games?
I'll play games.

18
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,978
But I'll have you know,
I hate games.

19
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,714
In fact, I quit grade school because
of motherfucking recess!

20
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:06,418
We agreed on a set price.
I get the weapons, I drop them off here.

21
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,287
You pay me 150,000 cash
for my troubles.

22
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:13,625
- 150,000 cash.
- 45,000 cash.

23
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:16,094
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

24
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,431
I didn't realize this is<i> Let's Make a Deal.</i>
Okay, Monty.

25
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:24,636
Forty-give grand
for $45,000 worth of weapons.

26
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:29,341
Hey, hey, come on. Come on.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

27
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,042
Wait!

28
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:38,350
Ryan, get the bags,
get the weapons.

29
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,192
Not cool,<i> hombre.</i>

30
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:58,103
I can do this
all day,<i> amigo.</i>

31
00:03:58,105 --> 00:03:59,571
Fuck!

32
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,440
- Oh, shit.
- Blanks.

33
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,743
Logan. Logan. Logan.

34
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,145
Logan!

35
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:09,447
Logan. Logan!

36
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,416
Logan!

37
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:36,474
Well, this is a sad commentary
on today's society.

38
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:39,811
<i>Don't take it too personal, Jack.</i>

39
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:43,081
Don't kid yourself, partner.
It's always personal.

40
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,250
PS, where the fuck
were you on those last two?

41
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:49,054
Marksmanship 101, boss.
Gun-target line was shit.

42
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:51,523
I'm firing .308 win mags.

43
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:54,492
Oh, by the way,
you got some brain in your hair.

44
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:58,463
- Jesus Christ!
<i>- At this range, a .308 woulda ripped right through</i>

45
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:03,068
your recently deceased business partners
and left you with a sucking chest wound.

46
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,204
Well, good to know. All right,
let's get the hell out of here.

47
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:08,139
On my way, boss man.

48
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:19,384
What happened
with Gabriel's rounds?

49
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:21,419
I couldn't get
to his spare mags.

50
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,456
- He would have noticed!
- That could have been bad.

51
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,826
- Could have.
- You guys are fucking idiots, by the way.

52
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:31,563
How many more times you think you're
going to get away with this blanks shit?

53
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:33,565
Is that concern
I hear in your voice?

54
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,134
Yeah, concern
for my future employment.

55
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:40,572
My skill set doesn't exactly
translate to working at Starbucks.

56
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:43,475
Let's get out of here.

57
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:44,876
I'll see you
in a couple of weeks.

58
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,444
If you're lucky.

59
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:49,414
Come on, let's see what you got.
Come on. There you go.

60
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,283
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't push me too hard.

61
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,508
Can you grab me a towel?

62
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,589
What the fuck is this?

63
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,025
- What the fuck is what?
- This!

64
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:26,097
- Where'd you find that?
- Jenna would be pissed.

65
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:30,968
- Jenna and me have only...
- Jenna and I. I'm just saying.

66
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,772
Jenna and I have only
been dating for a few weeks.

67
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:38,876
- I'm throwing this out.
- Fine. I don't care. Throw it out.

68
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:49,921
Wow. I'm impressed.

69
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,690
When's the last time
you heard from her, anyway?

70
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,393
I don't know.

71
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,665
Six months.

72
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:23,388
You're a real nutless wonder,
you know that, Jack?

73
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:28,025
Honestly. What the hell
did you ever see in her?

74
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:33,431
Everybody down!

75
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:37,969
Get that. Let's go!

76
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:42,573
- Hello, Edward.
- <i>So glad you picked up.</i>

77
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,442
I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now,

78
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,144
<i>so I'll probably
just call you back.</i>

79
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,546
I know where you are
and I know what you are doing.

80
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:49,881
<i>Or did you forget who planned</i>

81
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,849
<i>this little trip
in the first place?</i>

82
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,751
You called this job off, Eddie.

83
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,853
So you can't blame me
for going ahead with this.

84
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,689
But I do blame you. You're
doing a job that I planned.

85
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:01,826
A job that I set up.
There are finder's fees associated with it.

86
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,796
Your job you called off and I
decided to move forward with?

87
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:08,866
Without me.
Without my permission, Karen.

88
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,002
What do you want, Eddie?

89
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,737
- My full share.
- <i>Which is?</i>

90
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:15,873
- One hundred percent.
- What happened to 60?

91
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,610
Well, the additional 40 is for the
indignity that I have suffered.

92
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,480
No fucking way.

93
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:25,917
<i>Yes fucking way, Karen.</i>

94
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,885
You called the cops?

95
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,787
What can I say?
My feelings were hurt.

96
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,889
<i>- You'll get nothing.
- A price I would gladly pay</i>

97
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,625
to teach you
a long overdue lesson.

98
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,804
Now, Glenn,

99
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,807
why is it that these ties look
like they were dipped in shit?

100
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:54,679
- Shit, Mr. Filosa?
- Shit. Yes.

101
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,848
Sir, you asked
for Scarlet Forest,

102
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,783
and I assure you these ties
are all Scarlet Forest.

103
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,885
- You're assuring me that?
- Yes, sir.

104
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:04,789
I'm assuring you that they look
like they were dipped in shit.

105
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,628
See this?

106
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:15,666
See this color? When that dries, that's
the color I want on these ties.

107
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:18,870
- Yes, sir.
- Off you go.

108
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:28,846
If Karen makes it out alive, she'll have
no choice but to take her original flight.

109
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,249
I need to know
exactly what she knows.

110
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,551
Yes, sir.

111
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,990
It's only a matter
of days now.

112
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:43,160
This job,
my job is right out there.

113
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:46,631
We can't let Karen fuck it up.

114
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:57,174
- Absolutely fucking not.
- Why not?

115
00:12:57,176 --> 00:13:01,979
Why? 'Cause the fact that you borrow my dog in
order to trick your veterinarian girlfriend

116
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,015
to thinking you're
an animal lover is pathetic.

117
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:07,318
I am an animal lover,
I'm just not an animal owner.

118
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,888
- Do you even like this woman?
- Yes, I like this woman. I like her a lot.

119
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,591
Then why do you continue
to lie to her?

120
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,927
I lie to her
because I like her!

121
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:19,030
Ha. Well,
spoken like a true man.

122
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,833
Stop it.

123
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,574
I want her home by morning.

124
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:39,884
Reception. Yeah, he's right here.
All right, I'll let him know.

125
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:42,353
She's ready for you. Dr. Connor's
in the back with a sea lion, okay?

126
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:46,190
- Let's go. Come on.
- Oh. And daisies are her favorites.

127
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:50,895
- You know, for next time.
- Now you tell me.

128
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,734
Good job.

129
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:59,070
Come on.

130
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,978
She's doing much
better today, Kerry.

131
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,682
I have another patient
for you, doc.

132
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:15,953
Hi, Grace! Hi!

133
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:18,222
- I think she remembers you.
- I think so.

134
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:21,092
- Are those for me?
- Yes.

135
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:23,027
- I love roses.
- Yeah.

136
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:26,297
- How was the conference?
- I knocked them dead.

137
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,633
Of course.
I knew you would.

138
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:30,901
- How about dinner tonight?
- Hmm... two conditions.

139
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,069
- Name them.
- You cook.

140
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,405
- Done.
- And Grace is there.

141
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,073
Of course.
Grace will always be there.

142
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,042
- Hi, baby. Hi!
- Who's that, Grace?

143
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,421
One of my men just called.
They spotted her arriving at the airport.

144
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:52,957
- They're following her now.
- She can't do it alone.

145
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,860
- Find them.
- Yes, sir.

Good to see you too, Jack.

Are you pregnant?

154

And I'll let you two
finish up here.

156
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:32,490
Use a condom.
That's all I'm going to say.

157
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:36,427
Jack, who is that woman?

158
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:48,239
- Yeah.
<i>- I found them, sir.</i>

159
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:49,907
- Good.
- <i>They'll be dead by morning.</i>

160
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:52,309
- Finish it.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

161
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,806
- How many months?
- Got any pickles?

162
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:26,076
- Karen...
- It's yours.

163
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:31,549
I know. I was in denial too
for a little while.

164
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,084
It's the first
of five stages of grief.

165
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,953
- Then there is...
- Where the fuck have you been?!

166
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:38,289
Then there's anger.

167
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,158
- I'm going to go.
- Oh! Jenna... Jenna.

168
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,862
Jenna, please, I'm so sorry
about this, you know... I...

169
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:47,565
Grace! Please!

170
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,166
- Do you want to call me later?
- Yes, of course.

171
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:52,102
Gimme a second.
Grace. Grace, knock it off!

172
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,505
I'm sorry. Just give me
one second, I'll walk you...

173
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:58,175
Grace! Come on, girl. Shut up!

174
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:04,849
Oh, shit!

175
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:09,486
Jenna, I need you
to listen to me.

176
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,455
Something very dangerous
is about to happen.

177
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,525
You can not ask any questions.
Do you understand me?

178
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,260
- What?
- That was a question!

179
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:45,522
Guns? You have guns?

180
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:48,092
Jack, is that a grenade?

181
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:53,464
What? Jack!

182
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,468
- You and me are going to talk.
- Now?

183
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,304
- Get to the boat.
- Let's go.

184
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:31,402
Move! Move! Move!

185
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,939
Let's go! Come on,
Jenna, get in the boat!

186
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:41,445
Come on, girl! Let's go!

187
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,216
- Karen, get down!
- The dock!

188
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:49,420
Move, move, move!

189
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:57,294
Get on the boat!

190
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,293
- Jack!
- Give me a minute, Karen.

191
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:31,261
- Yeah, but I...
- Did you see the finger?!

192
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,163
- Yes, Jack, I see the finger!
- Well, the finger means

193
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:37,067
- I need one minute to think!
- Here they come!

194
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,007
What are you doing?

195
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:45,376
- I'm calling the police!
- Give me that!

196
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:47,378
There's no calling the police!

197
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,651
Ah!

198
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:03,227
- Where are we going, Jack?
- Somewhere safe, Jenna.

199
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:08,599
- Okay, Karen, go.
- Someone thinks I stole from him.

200
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,201
- Did you? Karen!
- What?!

201
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,038
- Did you steal from someone?
- No!

202
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,541
Jesus Christ! Do you ever
think anything through?!

203
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:21,512
Oh, don't talk to me about thinking things
through! You over analyze everything!

204
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:24,815
I like to plan! I like to plan so I don't
get into shit like this!

205
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:29,486
Please just pay attention to
the people trying to kill us!

206
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:30,788
Faster! Faster! Let's go!

207
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:35,826
- I ran a job for Eddie Filosa.
- Oh, mistake number one.

208
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:38,095
- You know him?
- I know of him.

209
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,533
Well, the job went south
and we lost the score.

210
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,234
Well, that happens.

211
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,640
Yeah, well, tell that to Eddie.
He wants me to make good for it!

212
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:53,544
- All of it?
- All of it!

213
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,650
- How big?
- Huge!

214
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:03,487
- That's not very rational.
- Eddie's not exactly rational, Jack.

215
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,495
- Is she okay?
- She's fine.

216
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:15,833
- What is Logan's dog even doing here?
- Grace is Logan's dog?

217
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,702
- She didn't know?
- I was going to tell you.

218
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:21,271
You were going to tell me what part, Jack?

219
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:24,308
That Grace isn't yours,
that you got an ex-girlfriend pregnant,

220
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,577
or that you're some type
of uber-criminal?!

221
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:29,213
She's got a point, Jack.

222
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,852
Come on, faster! Go!

223
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:43,594
Can you take out that Jet Ski?

224
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:46,497
I'm out! Of course
I can take out the Jet Ski!

225
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:54,738
There's something wrong
with your gun!

226
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,473
There's nothing wrong
with my gun, Karen.

227
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:58,142
Oh, really?

228
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:00,177
Then why don't we let "this
year's model" give it a try?

229
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:03,914
- Just leave her alone.
- Why? I know she likes to just lay on her back,

230
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,716
but maybe she wants
to participate more.

231
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,452
What the hell did you ever see
in this woman, Jack?

232
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:11,522
I gave him a reason
to fuck with the lights on!

233
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,267
- Jack!
- What?

234
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:24,668
There are
no more Jet Skis.

235
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,737
The bad news, no more guns.

236
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,840
- What do we got left?
- A shotgun.

237
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,911
We're never going to hit them
from this distance.

238
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,680
- I'm going to flatspin the boat.
- Really?

239
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:40,384
Just like Brazil.

240
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:06,476
Ah!

241
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,530
Karen! Take the wheel!

242
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:28,732
- Get her out of here!
- Go!

243
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:34,805
Jack, what are you doing? Jack!

244
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,897
Fucking bitch!

245
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:23,654
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, God!

246
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:36,366
Mm!

247
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:42,506
Fuck!

248
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:48,679
Grace, get over here,
girl. Come on!

249
00:25:56,455 --> 00:26:00,390
Are you all right?

250
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:11,001
- Jenna, can I talk to you for a minute, please?
- Yeah.

251
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,740
I need you to get a hotel
for the next few days.

252
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,842
Call in sick to work.
Don't tell them where you are.

253
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:20,811
I don't want to get a hotel.
I want to go home.

254
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:22,813
I understand you're
a bit overwhelmed right now,

255
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:24,681
but I've been through these
things in the past, a few times.

256
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:27,451
You're just going
to have to trust me.

257
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:31,755
- Are you coming with me?
- Not right now, but I'll come back to check on you.

258
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,790
Are you going somewhere
with her?

259
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:36,693
Yeah. Unfortunately.

260
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:39,396
I need to figure out what's
going on. I need some answers.

261
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:41,131
I'm not going to get those
with you around.

262
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:43,500
- Are you going to waterboard her?
- No.

263
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:45,736
I'm not going
to waterboard her, I just...

264
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:47,771
I just don't want you to get more
involved than you already are.

265
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:50,073
I think you should
waterboard her.

266
00:26:51,577 --> 00:26:54,811
Okay. I'm sorry...
about all this.

267
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:58,815
- Me too.
- Logan'll be by in the morning to pick up Grace.

268
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,650
Okay.

269
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,775
The saddest part, Grace,
I've had worse dates.

270
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:37,087
Anyone seen the boss? Hey!

271
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:39,456
Anyone seen the boss?

272
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:41,825
Like really...

273
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,094
What the fuck? You bitches.

274
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:48,165
What the fuck?
What's your problem, psycho?

275
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,866
You. Dick breath.

276
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:52,436
Hey! You can't talk
to us like that.

277
00:27:52,438 --> 00:27:54,070
Yes, I can.

278
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:57,040
What's the matter with you?
What the fuck are you doing, girls?

279
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,743
Let me ask you a question.
How do you invest your money?

280
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:02,212
- What?
- Invest.

281
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:05,215
Eddie pays you, right?
What do you do with your money?

282
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:08,585
- I buy shit.
- You buy shit like what?

283
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:10,787
- Shoes.
- Shoes. And?

284
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,856
- Nice shoes.
- Great. What else?

285
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:16,126
- These boobs.
- They're nice boobs, by the way.

286
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:19,062
What's your point, tough guy?
We don't have all day.

287
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:23,633
My point is you got about
two, maybe three more years

288
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:27,070
of whoring yourself out before
a whole new batch of younger

289
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:30,474
and prettier whores comes rolling
in through that front door.

290
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:32,142
And all you're going
to have to show for it

291
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:35,812
is a closet full of old shoes,
and a banged up pussy.

292
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:40,584
Now, if I had a vagina,
and I had your ass,

293
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:43,854
and your fucking tits,
I'd be a fucking millionaire.

294
00:28:43,856 --> 00:28:47,757
Instead, the good Lord blessed me with
a big dick and moral flexibility.

295
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,828
So... I'm going
to ask you one more time,

296
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,499
or I swear to God I'm going
to bitch-slap you so hard,

297
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:59,135
your brand-new tits are going
to pop out of your ass. Understood?

298
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:02,939
- Where's Eddie?
- The cabana.

299
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:05,008
You girls have a good day.

300
00:29:08,514 --> 00:29:11,181
We've known each other
a long time.

301
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:14,985
You've never been one for foreplay, so why
don't you just spare me the bullshit.

302
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:18,622
Tell me what you need.

303
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:23,960
- There's a job.
- I knew it.

304
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:27,197
- Just hear me out, Jack.
- If I remember correctly,

305
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:30,967
the last time I helped you out, Karen,
I almost ended up on the wrong side of the grass.

306
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:33,103
If I remember correctly,
you weren't exactly putting up a fight.

307
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:35,205
Forget it, Karen.

308
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:39,009
I'm in trouble, Jack.
Real trouble.

309
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:42,045
- I wouldn't be here unless I needed...
- Someone.

310
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:45,682
you.
Unless I needed you.

311
00:29:45,684 --> 00:29:50,320
I lost my entire crew, Jack.
I barely got out alive.

312
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:53,590
And I lost the score. Eddie's going
to kill me unless I pay him back.

313
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:56,927
This job? It's big money,
small risk.

314
00:29:56,929 --> 00:30:01,998
If we pull it off, it's enough
money to pay back Eddie and...

315
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,768
and then some.

316
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:18,114
What's the job?

317
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,920
I like chess. It's a perfect
metaphor for life.

318
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:27,891
Every piece is bound
to its nature, just like people.

319
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:30,860
- What do you think, Simon?
- I don't play.

320
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:33,930
You really should.
What about you, Bob?

321
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:36,967
- I'm more of a poker guy.
- Yeah, I like poker.

322
00:30:36,969 --> 00:30:40,036
Also a great game. All about trying to make
the most of what you got...

323
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:43,807
Yeah, sure, Mr. F. Listen, could
you tell me what I'm doing here?

324
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:46,743
Bear with me.
This will just take a second.

325
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:49,779
I want you to put your hand on this Bible.
I have something to ask you

326
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,781
and I want you to be
perfectly honest with me.

327
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:55,285
- Don't know why...
- Indulge me.

328
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:05,095
I appreciate poker.
It's a game of hope. A game of dreams.

329
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:09,399
A game of lies.
But chess, it's a game of order.

330
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:13,737
This pawn can
only move one way.

331
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:18,141
Move forward,
can only take diagonally.

332
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:22,979
And if it works really hard,
it can become something better,

333
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:28,018
something more.
Like you. You're a pawn, Rob.

334
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,988
And what pawns do not do
is tell secrets to the enemy queen

335
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:35,125
- in hopes that she'll fuck him.
- Mr. F, I never said a word!

336
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:38,762
What are you doing?!
No! No! God! Fuck! God!

337
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:41,097
So many nerves
in the hand.

338
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:44,100
God! Fuck! God! I said nothing!

339
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:47,837
We're not playing poker now,
Robert. We're playing chess.

340
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:51,141
I am the king,
Simon is my knight.

341
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:53,143
Leave it.

342
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:56,813
You are a pawn,
and if you aren't careful,

343
00:31:56,815 --> 00:31:58,982
you are going to be sacrificed.
Do you understand that?

344
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:02,018
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Now, Robert,

345
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:06,423
what exactly did you tell Karen regarding
my latest business ventures?

346
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:09,993
- I told her about the Eastern Federal job.
- Yes.

347
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:14,097
- I told her about the Cayman Islands job.
- Yes.

348
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:19,102
I told her about
the armored car.

349
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:21,838
- The armored car.
- Yeah. Yes, sir.

350
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,042
- That means...
- That means she knows everything.

351
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:31,381
What are we going
to do with Robert?

352
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:36,352
You're going to kill me.

353
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:39,989
Eventually, yeah.

354
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:42,092
Eventually.

355
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:51,167
- Armored car?
- Yeah. More or less.

356
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:57,040
- It's a stupid sport.
- It was a nice shot.

357
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:59,142
- Don't be a dick.
- Here.

358
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:06,015
So what do you think?

359
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:11,020
I think you've definitely secured yourself
a spot on<i> The Jerry Springer Show.</i>

360
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:15,024
- I mean about the job.
- I know what you mean, Jack.

361
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:18,762
Nothing,
and I mean nothing good,

362
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:21,064
can come from working
with her, man.

363
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:24,100
- What about the baby?
- Are you sure it's even yours?

364
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:28,204
She's been gone, man, shacking
up with only God knows what.

365
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:32,342
- Hey, hey.
- Sorry.

366
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:36,112
I just keep
hoping she's changed.

367
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:41,785
And after the last job that she had that
went bad and now the baby, I just...

368
00:33:41,787 --> 00:33:46,089
Maybe she'll finally want something
different, something... something else.

369
00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:50,293
- Just say it.
- Me.

370
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:54,798
Yeah. Maybe she'll
finally want me.

371
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,234
Grace! Come here, girl.

372
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,937
Come on. Come here.

373
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:05,275
Be a poodle, Grace. Come on, be a
little dumb-ass yippie poodle.

374
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:07,010
- Come on.
- What're you doing?

375
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:09,145
- Proving a point.
- Yeah?

376
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:11,247
- Which is?
- That I have a better chance

377
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:14,117
of Grace turning
into some dumb-ass poodle

378
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:18,121
than you do of getting this
cold-hearted, manipulative bitch

379
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:20,957
to settle down
and live a normal life.

380
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:23,459
Oh, you think this kid
is going to change who she is?

381
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:26,863
You think this kid is going
to make her love you?

382
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:28,932
Wake the fuck up, my friend.

383
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:33,036
She's always going to be Karen.
Now she's just Karen with a kid.

384
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:38,274
Yeah.

385
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:41,177
You know why
I keep that picture?

386
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:44,414
There was a time when we used to
talk about moving to St. John,

387
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:47,450
or some other tropical island,
opening up a dive shop,

388
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:50,620
living the rest
of our lives in paradise.

389
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:52,322
Some real
Hemingway-type shit.

390
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:54,424
And that picture
was a reminder of why I do...

391
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,526
why we keep doing
what we're doing.

392
00:34:56,528 --> 00:35:01,431
You're just taking these risks,
and making easy money the hard way, but...

393
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:05,134
I can't keep
doing this shit forever.

394
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:07,437
So if there's even the
slightest chance that I can make

395
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:11,407
that stupid fucking pipe dream
a reality, I'm going for it.

396
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:16,880
You don't owe me anything,
Logan.

397
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:20,116
Don't say that.

398
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:23,253
Don't you fucking say that.

399
00:35:23,255 --> 00:35:26,623
We're friends, right?
Practically fucking family?

400
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:30,326
- Yeah.
- Then it's not about owing me.

401
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:34,197
It was never about that.
It's what friends do, it's what family does.

402
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:36,399
We... we back
each other's plays,

403
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:39,235
even when we absolutely know
they're fucked from the get go.

404
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:44,340
- Right?
- Yeah, I guess so.

405
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:49,345
Mm... No. No "I guess so."
That's the way it is.

406
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:52,248
- So?
- So?

407
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,218
Let's do this.

408
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,487
Why are you so grumpy?

409
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:13,202
- Is that the truck?
- That's the truck. 30 million in gems.

410
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,237
That's the route.

411
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:16,973
- Two days?
- Two days.

412
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:24,047
- We're going to need a second gunman.
- Definitely.

413
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:27,050
- We're going to need a driver.
- I know where to find one.

414
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:31,421
- A damn good driver.
- I know where to find one.

415
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,310
Drew.

416
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,480
Andrew.

417
00:36:57,482 --> 00:37:00,016
Andrew Herzberg!

418
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:11,094
Jack? Jack! Really?
I can't believe what I'm seeing!

419
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:12,595
- It's been a long time, brother.
- This guy?

420
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,998
This guy flew in the 160th?

421
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,666
Right up until breaking
his commander's jaw.

422
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:21,738
Sh... Night stalkers don't...

423
00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:30,646
That was completely necessary.

424
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:33,349
I feel a hundred percent.

425
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:39,122
- What brings you to Thailand?
- We're in Mississippi.

426
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:40,656
Really?

427
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:43,659
No fucking way.

428
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:46,195
Can we get
a napkin or something?

429
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,498
- Right there.
- Herzberg!

430
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,368
There you are.
You piece of shit!

431
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,437
- You pissed the bed again!
- What?

432
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,606
Yeah. You pissed the bed!

433
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:00,043
Honey, I know I'm really big,
but, you know, it still hurts.

434
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:03,679
Smell it. Smell it!
Smell your filthy piss!

435
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:07,483
- All right. Well, it is me. Definitely.
- Oh, yeah.

436
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:11,187
Mm! It smells like whiskey,
and failure,

437
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:15,458
and sadness, and everything
else bad in the world!

438
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:20,196
- This guy's a mess.
- He's doing much better than the last time I saw him.

439
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:22,098
Don't ask.

440
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:29,572
So, what are you thinking, Drew?

441
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:32,842
I think this baby is capable
of what you're asking for.

442
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:36,546
I'll just need to make a few modifications,
but you know me, man.

443
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:39,482
- I can drive, fly, or fuck...
- You think, or you know?

444
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:43,186
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, there's a big difference.

445
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:45,354
You may think you're
one hell of a driver,

446
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:46,556
but I know you're
a drunk asshole.

447
00:38:46,558 --> 00:38:48,858
How could she possibly
already know

448
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,494
- that I'm an asshole?
- What's the problem?

449
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:55,298
Our plan lies strictly on whether
or not this drunk asshole can drive.

450
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:59,435
- That doesn't concern you?
- Again with the unsubstantiated asshole claim.

451
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,537
No. It doesn't concern me.

452
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:04,407
- Because I've seen him drive.
- And I've seen him drunk.

453
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:07,577
I never drive drunk.
Buzzed, maybe.

454
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:11,747
Hung-over, absolutely.
But drunk, never.

455
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:16,119
Oh, that's a relief, coming from the
guy whose breath still smells like puke.

456
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:18,554
I'll be in the car.

457
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:22,492
- She's nice.
- This is a good day.

458
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:42,612
You've any idea how sexy you are
when you do your tough guy routine?

459
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:45,748
- Everything set?
- Yes, Jack. Everything's set.

460
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:50,653
I love how you worry
about every single detail

461
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:52,922
right up
until the last minute.

462
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:55,258
- Karen...
- Mm-hm?

463
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,826
Stop.

464
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:01,531
I can't.

465
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:04,333
- Because of Ms. Milquetoast?
- She's not milquetoast.

466
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:07,537
Come on, Jack. That girl
is Madame Vanilla. Boring.

467
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:10,640
It's not about Madame Vanilla.

468
00:40:10,642 --> 00:40:14,477
It's not about Jenna,
it's about...

469
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:17,280
- It's about us, it's you.
- Mm-hm.

470
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:22,485
And what I want, what you want and
how that is... completely different.

471
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:26,389
I don't think that what we
want is that much different.

472
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:47,510
You don't have
a second gunman.

473
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:49,545
You know that
I'm more than capable.

474
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,381
Absolutely not.

475
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,417
- It's my job.
- No.

476
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:55,685
I should be on that truck.

477
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:58,521
If you're on this job,
I walk, I'm gone.

478
00:40:58,523 --> 00:41:00,289
Then who?

479
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:03,492
Andrew has a guy.

480
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:06,362
- Oh, and you trust him?
- Yeah. I trust Andrew.

481
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:07,597
Fine!

482
00:41:16,441 --> 00:41:18,541
Thirty million
in gems on this truck?

483
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:21,510
That's right,
30 million in gems.

484
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:25,748
- We'll get 20 on the market.
- Maybe more.

485
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,551
Let's just count on 20.

486
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:29,852
You owe Eddie eight.

487
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:34,757
That leaves roughly 12
for the five of us.

488
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:39,629
That's correct.

489
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:44,600
And then what?

490
00:41:52,277 --> 00:41:54,910
Well, then a house
in St. John.

491
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:03,486
Who is it?
Our second gunman?

492
00:42:03,488 --> 00:42:07,556
Nicholas Sepher. Andrew knows
him from his time in the Army.

493
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:20,603
Don't you fucking do it, woman.
Don't you do it!

494
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:22,038
Maybe you should have not
texted your ex-wife.

495
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,607
Her mother died!
Do not fucking do it!

496
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:27,643
- You can die in hell.
- Oh, hell would be fucking paradise

497
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:31,414
compared to being
married to you!

498
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:32,782
Andrew told me
about the job.

499
00:42:32,784 --> 00:42:34,750
We're not done with our talk.

500
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:37,053
I'm in, man.

501
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,689
Yeah, you're in, all right,
for a whole new world of hurt.

502
00:42:39,691 --> 00:42:41,657
- You haven't heard the details.
- I don't need to. I don't care,

503
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,059
as long as it involves Herzberg,
it's going to get me

504
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,760
the fuck outta
this house for a while.

505
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,796
And what the hell's
so wrong with our house?

506
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:48,431
- This thing fairly dangerous?
- Sure.

507
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:49,732
- It's Jack, right?
- Yeah.

508
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,667
Well, Jack, I miss my life.

509
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:55,504
I miss getting fucked by a real
man. We all make sacrifices.

510
00:42:55,506 --> 00:43:01,477
I will choke a bitch.
Can you shut the fuck up?!

511
00:43:01,479 --> 00:43:03,813
I hope you get shot.

512
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:06,649
Look in my eyes, Jack.
Do I look happy to you?

513
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:10,653
- I hope you get dick shot.
- It's this. Every day.

514
00:43:10,655 --> 00:43:12,722
The worst kind of shot.

515
00:43:15,126 --> 00:43:17,626
- You married, Jack? You got kids?
- Ish.

516
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:20,996
- Yeah. Well, it sucks, man.
- Nicholas.

517
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:23,833
Because everybody's
happy except me. Me?

518
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:25,868
- Nicholas!
- Oh, man, I'm just looking for a reason

519
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:28,137
to put a gun back in my hand,
and a bullet in someone else's brain

520
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:30,473
before I put one in my own.
So tell me,

521
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:32,375
are the guys we're going up
against, are they bad?

522
00:43:32,377 --> 00:43:34,744
- Faceless corporation.
- That's even better.

523
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:36,712
- Nicholas!
- What?!

524
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:39,548
- I'm going to give you crabs.
- That's it. Pack your shit.

525
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:42,551
Take those fucking rat dogs
and get out of my house!

526
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:44,587
One of those dogs
is yours, cocksucker.

527
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:47,857
Do I look like I wanted
a fucking Labradoodle?!

528
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:52,128
She's our baby. I'm going
to piss on your laptop.

529
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:54,730
She will. Excuse me.

530
00:43:57,435 --> 00:43:59,402
He'll do.

531
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:03,706
Guard in the front.
Guard in the back.

532
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:05,541
Anyone who tries
to drive this thing

533
00:44:05,543 --> 00:44:07,009
other than the driver
assigned for that day,

534
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:09,845
biometric system automatically
kills the engine.

535
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:12,848
Can't be restarted. Okay?
We got 20 minutes or less.

536
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:16,752
State-of-the-art vault. Once it's locked,
only gets open from the inside.

537
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:20,790
It takes us about an hour,
an hour to cut through.

538
00:44:20,792 --> 00:44:22,425
- How am I doing so far, Karen?
- Mm...

539
00:44:22,427 --> 00:44:25,728
Let's run through this. Nick.

540
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:28,864
I stop the truck.

541
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:31,834
- I take out the guard.
- The glass is bulletproof.

542
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,736
Well, it's a good thing
I ain't using bullets.

543
00:44:33,738 --> 00:44:36,739
- What're you using?
- Spark plugs.

544
00:44:36,741 --> 00:44:39,742
These babies will break bulletproof
glass like my wife breaks my balls.

545
00:44:39,744 --> 00:44:43,012
- Logan.
- Provide overwatch.

546
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:46,749
- Andrew.
- So at 0900 I pick you up,

547
00:44:46,751 --> 00:44:48,684
I drive the tow truck.

548
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:54,657
- You forgot the armored car.
- Right. I'll get it next time.

549
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:57,660
- Asshole.
- And Karen.

550
00:44:57,662 --> 00:45:01,630
Oh, I stay here.
Because I'm fat and pregnant.

551
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:04,767
- You know, I was...
- She's fat and pregnant.

552
00:45:04,769 --> 00:45:07,236
Just the way I like them.

553
00:45:07,238 --> 00:45:10,139
I still don't know how you plan on
breaking into the truck's vault.

554
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:12,975
Because it's a surprise.

555
00:45:12,977 --> 00:45:15,077
- Oh.
- I love surprises.

556
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:18,013
Mm-hm. We all like
surprises, right, guys?

557
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:26,222
- Logan?
- Yeah. Look, I don't like you, I don't fucking trust you.

558
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:29,825
You be where you're supposed to be tomorrow.
Car fueled up, ready to go.

559
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:33,229
- I'll be there.
- That's good to hear. Because if you're not,

560
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:36,499
I'll find you, wait for
that fucking kid to be born,

561
00:45:36,501 --> 00:45:40,069
and give you a Colombian necktie as
a belated baby shower present.

562
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:44,607
Graphic, but it gets your point across.
Are we done?

563
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:46,242
No, we're not fucking done.

564
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:48,244
He's got a great thing
going with Jenna.

565
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,845
He doesn't need you
fucking it up.

566
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:51,647
You don't think
that he should be

567
00:45:51,649 --> 00:45:53,616
with someone like that
any more than he does.

568
00:45:53,618 --> 00:45:55,818
Let me rephrase.
You fuck this up,

569
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,554
you fuck over Jack,
and I'll kill you.

570
00:45:58,556 --> 00:46:00,923
Now you're just being redundant.

571
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:44,967
Get on there, my little friend.
Yeah. Like old times.

572
00:46:50,942 --> 00:46:53,208
Look alive, people. Showtime.

573
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:57,613
- You ready, Nick?
- Let's rock and roll.

574
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:18,133
What's going on?

575
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:22,237
Fuck!

576
00:47:25,276 --> 00:47:28,110
Hey, buddy!
You might want to duck!

577
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:46,929
- I'm going to the next location.
- Copy that.

578
00:47:56,674 --> 00:47:58,307
Jack, we got a problem.

579
00:47:58,309 --> 00:48:01,276
- How soon?
- Check your six, boss.

580
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:11,954
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. Let's go.
Come back. Back. Hold! Right there.

581
00:48:26,337 --> 00:48:28,237
Get ready.

582
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,972
All right, Drew.
We gotta bounce.

583
00:48:29,974 --> 00:48:31,173
Let's go!

584
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:40,683
Let's go.

585
00:48:54,999 --> 00:48:57,800
Jack, you got three vehicles
headed your way.

586
00:48:57,802 --> 00:49:00,703
And seven...

587
00:49:00,705 --> 00:49:02,271
Six bad guys.

588
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:22,024
- We got three on us.
- Welcome to the suck.

589
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:28,097
Left! Go left!

590
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:32,735
- We got one on the right.
- I got him.

591
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:55,190
Shit! Why do the bad guys always
have automatic weapons?

592
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:57,993
I don't know,
but I'm getting hard!

593
00:50:10,074 --> 00:50:11,907
- You got him?
- One down. Two to go.

594
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:13,142
There you go, Jackie boy!

595
00:50:25,156 --> 00:50:26,522
Shit!

596
00:50:32,463 --> 00:50:35,130
You got him, Jackie boy!

597
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,208
Get me closer.

598
00:51:07,331 --> 00:51:11,266
- Closer!
- Where are they? I can't see them.

599
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:12,501
All right. Drive.

600
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:20,943
Shit, I don't see them!

601
00:51:20,945 --> 00:51:23,245
Go! Go!
On the left! On the left!

602
00:51:24,148 --> 00:51:26,582
Whoa!

603
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:33,322
There. Right there!

604
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:02,117
Oh, God!

605
00:52:04,255 --> 00:52:05,888
Ah! Fuck!

606
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:12,094
Oh, shit! Brake!

607
00:52:22,206 --> 00:52:26,174
- Oh! Yeah!
- Whoo!

608
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:28,210
That a boy!

609
00:52:36,687 --> 00:52:40,022
Jackie boy!
We got about 15 minutes

610
00:52:40,024 --> 00:52:42,190
- before this place is swarming with cops.
- I just need two.

611
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:43,525
You want me
to get you a thermal lance?

612
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:45,961
I don't need to get in.

613
00:52:45,963 --> 00:52:47,562
I just need this guy
to want out.

614
00:52:54,972 --> 00:52:56,471
Stop it!

615
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:06,581
Hands behind your back!
On your stomach! On your stomach!

616
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:09,184
Hands behind your back! Down!

617
00:53:15,326 --> 00:53:19,061
Holy dingle berries!

618
00:53:19,063 --> 00:53:21,296
- That's a lot of coin.
- Just like Karen said.

619
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:26,468
Yeah. Just like Karen said.

620
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:28,303
All right.
Let's get out of here.

621
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:45,554
- Come on, Jack. Let's rock and roll.
- Yeah.

622
00:54:44,181 --> 00:54:46,181
<i>Where you going, boss man?</i>

623
00:54:46,183 --> 00:54:48,817
I just want to check something
out. It's probably nothing.

624
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:52,120
Just keep going, I'll...
I'll catch up with you.

625
00:55:10,741 --> 00:55:13,575
You were always a miracle worker
with your hands.

626
00:55:13,577 --> 00:55:16,378
It would have taken me
at least five minutes. Hey!

627
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:19,448
Just stop right there.

628
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:22,217
- So, what happens now, Eddie?
- What happens now?

629
00:55:22,219 --> 00:55:24,553
You're going to give me that little
black box, that's what happens now.

630
00:55:24,555 --> 00:55:28,490
- Then what?
- And then what? Then you get to live.

631
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:33,428
- Eddie!
- What?

632
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,464
Let her go.

633
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:40,302
Put the gun down, hero.

634
00:55:40,304 --> 00:55:42,537
Put the gun down and kick it
over here towards me.

635
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:46,541
- Don't do it, Jack.
- Nobody asked you your opinion, so shut the fuck up!

636
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:49,678
Don't worry, hero. With you, she might have
liked it all sweet and gentle,

637
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,447
but with me, she liked it
a little bit rougher.

638
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:55,584
Mm. Isn't that right,
sweetheart?

639
00:55:55,586 --> 00:55:58,687
Kick it over here to me!

640
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:07,729
What did you promise him. Huh?
What did you promised him?

641
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:12,467
Money? Sex? What?

642
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:17,772
No.

643
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:22,911
He doesn't know? No.

644
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:26,515
You bitch.

645
00:56:26,517 --> 00:56:30,519
Let me show you something.
Let me show you something.

646
00:56:33,157 --> 00:56:36,191
- Eddie. Eddie...
- This? Is that what you're talking about?

647
00:56:36,193 --> 00:56:38,426
Eddie, please, no.

648
00:56:39,363 --> 00:56:40,829
Eddie. Eddie!

649
00:56:40,831 --> 00:56:41,897
Say bye-bye to the baby.

650
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:43,231
Don't do it, Eddie.

651
00:56:44,168 --> 00:56:45,634
No!

652
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:50,505
Oh, no! No baby!

653
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:54,576
Oh, no. No one's hurt.

654
00:56:55,946 --> 00:56:58,513
So you did make it out

655
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:00,582
of the Caymans with something.
Get over there.

656
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:03,318
Guess she needed you
to screw me out of this.

657
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:07,589
<i>Jack, I'm in position,
but I can't get a clean shot.</i>

658
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:12,460
- Three...
- Shame really.

659
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:13,795
If things were different,

660
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:15,864
we could have made
a lot of dough, you and me.

661
00:57:15,866 --> 00:57:20,835
- <i>Two...</i>
- Well, it's a real shame, Jack.

662
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:24,406
One. On your go.

663
00:57:24,408 --> 00:57:26,541
Sometimes things
just don't work out.

664
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:30,312
Down now!

665
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:38,520
- Jack!
- Let's go!

666
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,440
Let's roll!

667
00:57:59,743 --> 00:58:03,345
- Yeah, let's go!
<i>- Logan, let's go.</i>

668
00:58:29,573 --> 00:58:33,775
- Ah!
- Come on, Logan. Let's go.

669
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:05,407
She's lost a lot of blood.
You guys should take her to a real hospital.

670
00:59:05,409 --> 00:59:07,509
We can't.

671
00:59:09,346 --> 00:59:10,945
Jenna, I can't thank you enough.

672
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:14,015
Just be out
of here by Monday.

673
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:18,486
And Jack,
don't ever call me again.

674
00:59:31,468 --> 00:59:34,669
I wouldn't want
to be Karen right about now.

675
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:36,538
Women.

676
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:43,345
Was it worth it?

677
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:46,448
Hm?

678
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:53,021
I asked you a question.
Was it worth it?

679
00:59:53,023 --> 00:59:56,458
- None of this was my plan, Jack.
- What was the plan, Karen?

680
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:00,662
- Was I supposed to get killed?
- No. You were supposed to get 30 million.

681
01:00:00,664 --> 01:00:02,697
What about
the fake pregnancy?

682
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:05,867
- I had to make sure.
- For what? For what?!

683
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:09,371
For this? Hm? This?

684
01:00:09,373 --> 01:00:11,806
This little thing?
What is this?

685
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:14,442
- A key.
- To what?

686
01:00:15,846 --> 01:00:17,145
God help me, Karen!

687
01:00:17,147 --> 01:00:19,948
You don't have the baby inside
to protect you.

688
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:22,684
A safe.

689
01:00:24,888 --> 01:00:29,057
This is for another job?

690
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:35,830
And how much is in this safe?

691
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:37,866
Hm? It has to be
a lot more than 30 million.

692
01:00:37,868 --> 01:00:39,167
We're talking 50? 75?

693
01:00:39,169 --> 01:00:41,803
- Half a billion.
- Oh, fuck! Bullshit.

694
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:43,438
Red diamonds.

695
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,607
CIA Black Op.

696
01:00:45,609 --> 01:00:48,710
Five million a carat,
100 carats, 500 million.

697
01:00:48,712 --> 01:00:50,512
The plane with the safe
flies in tomorrow,

698
01:00:50,514 --> 01:00:52,914
just long enough to refuel,
and then it's gone.

699
01:00:52,916 --> 01:00:55,884
Oh, I see. I see.
And what were you going to do?

700
01:00:55,886 --> 01:00:58,186
Just walk in there
and take them?

701
01:00:58,188 --> 01:01:00,822
No one was supposed
to get hurt.

702
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:03,425
Logan did.

703
01:01:03,427 --> 01:01:05,760
Yeah, I see,
not that you fucking care!

704
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:09,764
I just earmarked my entire team. We have a death
mark on us. Eddie's going to hunt us down.

705
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:13,601
- So thank you very much!
- I never meant for this to happen!

706
01:01:20,444 --> 01:01:23,144
What about that sonogram
I found in your purse?

707
01:01:25,649 --> 01:01:29,184
It was real.
But I lost the baby.

708
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:32,654
Was it mine?

709
01:01:45,669 --> 01:01:47,869
Go get your diamonds.
Have a nice life.

710
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:52,207
With half a billion, you can afford
to stay the fuck out of mine.

711
01:02:25,876 --> 01:02:32,080
Come on, Logan. I could really use that
"I told you so" look right about now.

712
01:02:51,735 --> 01:02:55,203
- I think you should kiss her on the forehead.
- What?

713
01:02:55,205 --> 01:02:59,974
I don't know. I mean, I feel like you
should kiss her or something, you know?

714
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:03,745
- Dude, have you...
- Make her feel like she's loved.

715
01:03:03,747 --> 01:03:05,680
She's not into
that sappy shit.

716
01:03:05,682 --> 01:03:09,684
Really? Jesus, she's sleeping.
I mean, what is she going to do?

717
01:03:09,686 --> 01:03:12,020
She'll break your fucking face.
That's what she'll do.

718
01:03:12,022 --> 01:03:18,993
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Welcome back. How you feeling?

719
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:21,062
Like I went dancing
with a claymore.

720
01:03:21,064 --> 01:03:23,898
Oh, baby! Oh, baby!

721
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:27,902
- What are you doing here, babe?
- I'm sorry. Is it...?

722
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:31,039
No, no, baby. It's just my leg.
Mm! It's just my leg.

723
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:33,241
Thank God!
I didn't mean what I said.

724
01:03:33,243 --> 01:03:35,043
I know.
I know you love my dick.

725
01:03:35,045 --> 01:03:38,179
- I'm sorry. It's...
- What did you bring me?

726
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:42,016
Oh. Jack, this was
on the front doorstep for you.

727
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:46,854
- What is it?
- Some kind of remote and a cell phone.

728
01:03:54,631 --> 01:03:58,633
<i>Jack.</i>

729
01:03:58,635 --> 01:04:02,904
My new best friend jerk off.
You left in such a hurry.

730
01:04:02,906 --> 01:04:04,739
What can I do for you, Eddie?

731
01:04:04,741 --> 01:04:07,375
Turns out Karen
isn't the cold-hearted bitch

732
01:04:07,377 --> 01:04:10,912
we made her out to be.
She stopped by my hotel

733
01:04:10,914 --> 01:04:13,748
<i>with what you now hold in your
hands. Tried to make amends.</i>

734
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:15,950
<i>Tried to tell me
that it was all her fault,</i>

735
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:20,021
to leave you and your merry band
of misfit hoods out of this.

736
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:24,892
- Here. Say hi, sweetheart.
- Just run, Jack.

737
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:28,296
That's right, Jack. Run.
Run as fast as you can.

738
01:04:28,298 --> 01:04:31,399
I probably won't use my
considerable resources to find you

739
01:04:31,401 --> 01:04:35,269
- <i>and put you down.</i>
- It's not the first time I've been threatened.

740
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:39,140
Nobody's threatening you yet.
I'm offering you a trade.

741
01:04:39,142 --> 01:04:41,776
She can rot in hell,
for all I care.

742
01:04:41,778 --> 01:04:44,045
<i>That's probably
an undeniable fact.</i>

743
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:47,115
But it's up to you whether
she starts her stint tomorrow,

744
01:04:47,117 --> 01:04:49,817
or 50 years from now.
Come on, Jack.

745
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:54,856
<i>I'm giving you a real
opportunity here. Impress me.</i>

746
01:04:57,394 --> 01:05:00,161
Can you guys give us a minute?

747
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:04,265
I can see why you like him.

748
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:06,034
He's not going
to do the job, Eddie.

749
01:05:06,036 --> 01:05:08,169
We'll see.

750
01:05:08,171 --> 01:05:12,407
Jesus.
That must have been hard.

751
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:14,809
I don't follow.

752
01:05:14,811 --> 01:05:19,080
It must have been
hard for her. Fuck.

753
01:05:19,082 --> 01:05:23,351
I hate to be the one
saying this. She fucked up.

754
01:05:23,353 --> 01:05:25,253
Big time.

755
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,989
But she at least tried
to do the stand-up thing

756
01:05:27,991 --> 01:05:29,691
and come clean to Eddie.

757
01:05:29,693 --> 01:05:32,160
She tried to wipe
our slates clean.

758
01:05:32,162 --> 01:05:34,696
That took guts.
She didn't have to do that.

759
01:05:34,698 --> 01:05:40,101
No. She got herself into this mess.
She can get herself out.

760
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:42,437
- Be a douche-bag.
- What?

761
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:46,007
- Be a douche-bag.
- What?

762
01:05:46,009 --> 01:05:52,213
No matter how hard you try to be a
douche-bag, Jack, you're not a douche-bag.

763
01:05:54,084 --> 01:05:57,218
I knew that the moment
you saved my life.

764
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:59,220
You could have let me down.

765
01:05:59,222 --> 01:06:03,024
You can't let Karen down,
baby or no baby.

766
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:07,061
No, no, no, no, no, no.

767
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:12,100
Not this time. Okay? You're
going to sit this one out.

768
01:06:16,206 --> 01:06:18,239
What's the job?

769
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:24,746
Half a bil, in diamonds.

770
01:06:26,249 --> 01:06:30,485
Why can't it ever just
be a local jewelry store?

771
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:46,234
That's Morgan Airfield,
the proverbial stomping ground

772
01:06:46,236 --> 01:06:49,103
for all things clandestine
and black ops.

773
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:53,107
Our plane lands in 17 hours.
Touches down for a refuel only,

774
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:55,176
giving us a window
of 15 whole minutes.

775
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:57,912
And all we gotta do
in that time is walk in,

776
01:06:57,914 --> 01:06:59,981
board the plane,
crack the safe,

777
01:06:59,983 --> 01:07:03,217
download the score,
and get the flock out of there.

778
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:05,386
You say it like that,
it almost sounds doable.

779
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:08,122
Say we even get onto
this airfield here,

780
01:07:08,124 --> 01:07:10,291
do we know how many guards we're going
to be dealing with on the ground?

781
01:07:10,293 --> 01:07:12,894
No. We'll have to figure
that out in real time.

782
01:07:12,896 --> 01:07:16,230
I mean, but are we talking like 50 guards,
or are we talking like 100 guards?

783
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:19,200
First things first. We gotta get onto
that airfield without getting shot.

784
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:23,070
I'm working. Okay?
How are we going to do that?

785
01:07:25,308 --> 01:07:28,075
- Manila?
- Manila?

786
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:31,179
- Didn't work out too good for you there.
- Maybe second time's the charm.

787
01:07:31,181 --> 01:07:32,280
Who the hell is Manila?

788
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:35,283
- She's adorable.
- Yeah.

789
01:07:35,285 --> 01:07:38,953
<i>All right, Drew. Keep
them busy while I get to work.</i>

790
01:07:42,025 --> 01:07:45,493
- Check out this clown.
- Want some ice cream?

791
01:07:46,129 --> 01:07:48,095
What the fuck?

792
01:07:55,505 --> 01:07:58,272
The gate's clear, Jack.
You're good to go.

793
01:07:58,274 --> 01:08:00,942
<i>Apsara, remember,
just like Nick showed you.</i>

794
01:08:00,944 --> 01:08:05,313
<i>Aim for the truck
and just pull the trigger.</i>

795
01:08:05,315 --> 01:08:07,448
Hold your fire.
Hold your fire!

796
01:08:12,622 --> 01:08:17,491
Anyone want a lick?
Come get your ice cream! Come!

797
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:22,129
What are you wearing?
Fuckers better run.

798
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:31,138
Move, move, move!

799
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:49,323
<i>♪ And on his farm
he had his crew ♪</i>

800
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:52,460
<i>♪ E-I-E-I-O ♪</i>

801
01:08:59,102 --> 01:09:01,302
All right, come on, baby.

802
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:05,973
<i>♪ And on his farm
he had some ice cream ♪</i>

803
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:13,281
Shit!

804
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:18,052
- Jack! Jack!
- Say again?

805
01:09:18,054 --> 01:09:21,088
<i>You gotta go. Move!</i>

806
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:25,126
I was wondering if you
were going to show up.

807
01:09:25,128 --> 01:09:28,362
What's wrong? Eddie doesn't
think I can do the job?

808
01:09:28,364 --> 01:09:31,699
Let's just say he wasn't sure Karen was
worth the half a billion.

809
01:09:31,701 --> 01:09:36,070
One man's trash and all.

810
01:09:36,072 --> 01:09:38,205
What's taking so long?

811
01:09:39,309 --> 01:09:41,676
You think you can go faster,
be my guest.

812
01:09:56,225 --> 01:10:00,294
- Got any ideas?
- Yeah.

813
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:01,963
One.

814
01:10:05,468 --> 01:10:07,535
Ahh!

815
01:10:45,008 --> 01:10:48,609
- You owe me a vacation!
- Fine.

816
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:51,178
Two vacations.

817
01:11:13,503 --> 01:11:17,538
Jack. You are a disappointment to me.
Karen said you were the best.

818
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:20,474
"The Michelangelo of thieves,"
to be exact.

819
01:11:20,476 --> 01:11:22,143
I may be getting
a little rusty.

820
01:11:22,145 --> 01:11:23,477
<i>It's all right.
Soon you'll be dead.</i>

821
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:26,514
Right after I shoot
Karen in the face.

822
01:11:26,516 --> 01:11:29,683
Well, that's graphic.
But you might want to just wait on that.

823
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:31,419
Could be worth
half a billion dollars.

824
01:11:31,421 --> 01:11:33,554
In case you missed it,
I have the diamonds.

825
01:11:33,556 --> 01:11:36,090
If the situation were reversed,

826
01:11:36,092 --> 01:11:38,426
even I couldn't get
them back once they land.

827
01:11:38,428 --> 01:11:40,094
That's because
you're not Michelangelo.

828
01:11:40,096 --> 01:11:42,563
<i>You see, Eddie,
the problem with those keygens,</i>

829
01:11:42,565 --> 01:11:44,665
<i>as remarkable as they are,
they take forever.</i>

830
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:46,801
<i>Way more than the 15 minutes
I had for refueling,</i>

831
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:49,236
<i>but you know
what goes real fast?</i>

832
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:50,371
Semtex.

833
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:24,438
Okay, cowboy.
You have my attention.

834
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:27,408
- Bring the diamonds to...
- Negative. I'll call you with a location.

835
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:30,277
You seem to forget
that I have the girl.

836
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:33,247
And you seem to
forget she can be a real bitch.

837
01:12:33,249 --> 01:12:37,318
It might not be worth a half
a billion dollars to me.

838
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:40,754
Okay, Jack.
Have it your way.

839
01:13:08,184 --> 01:13:10,484
Your boy's got some sand.

840
01:13:12,822 --> 01:13:16,490
- You're not dead yet?
- Only on the inside.

841
01:13:20,196 --> 01:13:23,797
- I'm sorry, Jack.
- Cozy little reunion.

842
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:25,833
Open it up.

843
01:13:25,835 --> 01:13:29,470
Yeah, I can't. Keygen's gone.
I lost it in the fall,

844
01:13:29,472 --> 01:13:33,207
but a man with your resources,
I'm sure you can figure a way into it

845
01:13:33,209 --> 01:13:35,809
in the privacy of your
own home, or lair,

846
01:13:35,811 --> 01:13:38,646
or whatever assholes
like you have.

847
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:43,484
Oh, Jack. There's still the
little matter of me killing you.

848
01:13:43,486 --> 01:13:47,221
We had a deal.

849
01:13:47,223 --> 01:13:50,925
I don't make deals with people that steal
from me. It's not good for business.

850
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:53,761
- My sniper.
- Your sniper's fucked.

851
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:57,498
Can't hear anything. I'm jamming
all signals transmitting out of here.

852
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:01,635
And I hope you don't think for one second I'm
going to step out from under this thing.

853
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:03,204
Nope.

854
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:06,440
Get down!

855
01:14:08,477 --> 01:14:11,278
Get him out of here! Go!
Come on!

856
01:14:12,982 --> 01:14:14,848
They're headed for the roof.

857
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:18,419
Karen, move!

858
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:29,597
911, how can I direct your call?

859
01:14:29,599 --> 01:14:31,832
<i>We just heard a bomb,
really big, and I think...</i>

860
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:34,668
Oh, my God! There's a whole bunch
of men with guns in my hotel.

861
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:39,473
Okay, ma'am. We have vehicles
responding right now. Just sit tight.

862
01:15:09,639 --> 01:15:12,306
911, how can I
direct your call?

863
01:15:12,308 --> 01:15:14,775
Yeah, we have vehicles
responding to you right now.

864
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:27,388
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

865
01:15:33,329 --> 01:15:35,763
Go! Go! Go!

866
01:15:40,636 --> 01:15:43,337
- Get to the roof.
- You sure don't need me, Jack?

867
01:15:43,339 --> 01:15:47,474
- I'm sure I don't need you.
- You need me, Jack.

868
01:15:56,752 --> 01:16:00,421
Ah! Shit!

869
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:04,525
Out of ammo, Jack? Huh?

870
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:09,630
Getting nervous?

871
01:16:25,815 --> 01:16:27,047
Fuck you!

872
01:16:33,723 --> 01:16:37,624
- Get over there, Jack! Fucker!
- Ah!

873
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:49,636
I had him!

874
01:16:52,508 --> 01:16:54,074
Give me the gun.

875
01:16:54,844 --> 01:16:57,378
Son of a...

876
01:17:03,686 --> 01:17:06,687
- Thanks for the help.
- You owe me three vacations, Jack.

877
01:17:06,689 --> 01:17:09,423
Looks like you're starting now.

878
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:24,638
Move! Let's go, man! Come on!

879
01:17:25,508 --> 01:17:27,674
Stop!

880
01:17:28,411 --> 01:17:31,712
Stop! All of this,

881
01:17:31,714 --> 01:17:34,715
just to get shot up here on this roof.
That's your plan?

882
01:17:34,717 --> 01:17:37,151
Ish.

883
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:48,529
- Bang!
- Eat a dick, asshole.

884
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:11,452
Come on!

885
01:18:29,905 --> 01:18:35,242
This will take you to Miami
and then... wherever you need to go.

886
01:18:35,244 --> 01:18:37,578
You always take care
of everything, Jack.

887
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:40,113
Your cut.

888
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:43,083
Seems a little light.

889
01:18:43,085 --> 01:18:46,053
You can take it up
with Logan if you'd like.

890
01:18:46,989 --> 01:18:48,755
No, I'll manage.

891
01:18:48,757 --> 01:18:52,593
- Goodbye, Karen.
- Jack...

892
01:18:52,595 --> 01:18:55,262
- Admit it.
- Admit what?

893
01:18:55,264 --> 01:19:00,701
You missed me. You missed this.
This is the most alive you've felt in a long time.

894
01:19:03,806 --> 01:19:08,242
- Admit it.
- Admit what?

895
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:13,547
You turned yourself in so we would have
to steal the diamonds and kill Eddie.

896
01:19:15,818 --> 01:19:21,188
Like I said, you always take
care of everything, Jack.

897
01:19:44,179 --> 01:19:46,179
Goodbye, Karen.

898
01:19:54,757 --> 01:19:56,757
Bye, Jack.

899
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:44,938
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

900
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:48,108
What are you looking at?

901
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:51,878
I can't believe you just handed her
five million dollars.

902
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:54,348
- She earned it.
- Like hell she did.

903
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:57,284
Consider it a severance package
for you shooting her.

904
01:20:57,286 --> 01:21:03,256
- That was an accident.
- "Marksmanship 101, boss. Gun target line was shit."

905
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:06,994
You know what they
say about hookers.

906
01:21:06,996 --> 01:21:13,367
No, Jack. I don't know what they
say about hookers. Enlighten me.

907
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:17,037
You don't pay them for sex.
You pay them to leave.

908
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:21,141
Justify it however you need to in
order to sleep at night, boss.

909
01:21:21,143 --> 01:21:24,411
- Call me a softy.
- I'll call you an idiot.

910
01:21:24,413 --> 01:21:29,650
Logan, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

911
01:21:29,652 --> 01:21:32,119
Really? I see it
more as an ending.

912
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:53,140
- How's Logan?
- She's good. Thanks.

913
01:21:53,142 --> 01:21:58,311
- And whose puppy is this?
- It's mine.

914
01:21:58,313 --> 01:22:03,283
Uh, yeah, I... have proof.

915
01:22:03,285 --> 01:22:06,119
I figured you'd ask.
His name is Roy.

916
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:09,356
- Jack, I...
- Look, Jenna, I was hoping for a second chance.

917
01:22:09,358 --> 01:22:13,894
- I know I don't deserve one...
- Deserve? You want to talk about deserve?

918
01:22:13,896 --> 01:22:17,030
Jack, I know I don't look like Karen,
but that doesn't mean I deserve

919
01:22:17,032 --> 01:22:18,965
to be treated
the way you treated me.

920
01:22:18,967 --> 01:22:22,002
You lied to me for weeks.
You almost got me killed.

921
01:22:22,004 --> 01:22:24,971
- I...
- Just let me finish.

922
01:22:24,973 --> 01:22:27,140
Okay, I liked you, a lot.

923
01:22:27,142 --> 01:22:32,012
You were sweet, caring,
gentle, funny, smart.

924
01:22:32,014 --> 01:22:34,081
And then you were still
all of those things,

925
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:37,317
but also this
incredible bad-ass.

926
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:40,987
Which was actually really sexy.

927
01:22:40,989 --> 01:22:44,157
But if you want to ask me out again,
you're going to have to do more

928
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:46,827
than just buy a puppy
and show up with flowers.

929
01:22:46,829 --> 01:22:48,295
Jenna, I... I don't...

930
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:50,063
Okay, how about this
for starters.

931
01:22:50,065 --> 01:22:52,132
You come to my office
in a few weeks,

932
01:22:52,134 --> 01:22:55,168
with your new puppy,
and if bad men haven't shown up

933
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:59,172
with guns to kill the poor
little innocent puppy by then,

934
01:22:59,174 --> 01:23:04,177
then maybe we have a chance at having a
dinner date without bullets and boat chases.

935
01:23:04,179 --> 01:23:07,748
- Deal?
- Deal.

936
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:11,218
And then, after an indefinite
number of dinner dates,

937
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:15,055
assuming that no pregnant
ex-girlfriends show up,

938
01:23:15,057 --> 01:23:16,923
and no one shoots at us,

939
01:23:16,925 --> 01:23:21,094
and if I don't catch you
in any more lies,

940
01:23:21,096 --> 01:23:23,330
you can somehow
manage all of that,

941
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:27,267
then maybe, just maybe,

942
01:23:27,269 --> 01:23:31,138
I'll give you a reason
to fuck with the lights on.

943
01:23:35,811 --> 01:23:40,147
Told you she'd like you. Yeah.

944
01:23:41,416 --> 01:23:44,518
Well, "How about
we go to dinner" is better than,

945
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:49,189
"Go fuck yourself, Jack,
I'm calling the cops."

946
01:23:59,301 --> 01:24:03,136
- Hello?
- I didn't know if you'd pick up.

947
01:24:03,138 --> 01:24:05,038
I didn't know it was you.

948
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:09,109
I deserve that.

949
01:24:09,111 --> 01:24:10,811
What do you want, Karen?

950
01:24:10,813 --> 01:24:12,846
I bought that house on St. John.

951
01:24:12,848 --> 01:24:14,848
<i>It's beautiful.
It's on the water,</i>

952
01:24:14,850 --> 01:24:16,283
<i>just like we talked about.</i>

953
01:24:16,285 --> 01:24:19,119
I'm even looking
into buying a dive shop.

954
01:24:19,121 --> 01:24:22,923
I'm happy for you, I really am,
but I don't see...

955
01:24:22,925 --> 01:24:25,192
Goddamn it! I'm no good
at apologizing, Jack.

956
01:24:25,194 --> 01:24:28,128
I've never apologized
to anyone for anything.

957
01:24:28,130 --> 01:24:31,264
Well, I mean,
I was supposed to, I just...

958
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:34,935
<i>I just didn't.</i>

959
01:24:34,937 --> 01:24:38,171
Jack, something changed me all
through all this, you know,

960
01:24:38,173 --> 01:24:41,308
seeing the pain
that I caused you, I...

961
01:24:43,846 --> 01:24:45,312
I want to be with you.

962
01:24:45,314 --> 01:24:49,182
<i>This house, the money,
without you it's...</i>

963
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:51,985
it's boring.

964
01:24:51,987 --> 01:24:56,156
But you know what's not boring,
you know what's never boring, Jack? Us.

965
01:24:56,158 --> 01:25:00,427
- You're lonely, Karen. Find...
- I love you.

966
01:25:00,429 --> 01:25:03,363
Jack, I love you.
I think I've always loved you.

967
01:25:03,365 --> 01:25:08,602
<i>And I know you love me.
We could make this work.</i>

968
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:11,304
<i>We could be happy.</i>

969
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:15,175
<i>We can be happy.</i>

970
01:25:15,177 --> 01:25:17,477

01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:19,913

01:25:27,155 --> 01:25:30,457

Jack, seriously. Why aren't
you picking up your phone?

979
01:25:53,916 --> 01:25:56,683
- Because we're pregnant!
- And we're rich!

980
01:25:56,685 --> 01:26:00,420
We're rich

Colonel Carter

who hated me so much
he threw me out of the Army?

Well, I'm with
his two daughters!

985
01:26:16,972 --> 01:26:19,973
Hey, Jack, I shaved the beard,

986
01:26:19,975 --> 01:26:24,611
and you owe me two more
vacations. Two more.

987
01:26:24,613 --> 01:26:28,415
Just want you to know
I'm fuckin' done with Roy.

988
01:26:28,417 --> 01:26:32,552
He shits and pisses everywhere.
I can't, I can't deal with that.

989
01:26:32,554 --> 01:26:35,588
I'm never watching the dog
again. Look at this shit. Look.

990
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:37,958
You wanna see? Look.

991
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:42,295
See that shit?
All he does is fuckin' shit.

992
01:26:42,297 --> 01:26:47,167
Roy, no! No!

993
01:26:47,169 --> 01:26:50,370
Jack, he's tryin' to fuck Grace.

994
01:26:51,373 --> 01:26:53,273

- I want her home by morning.
- All right.

1005
01:27:37,119 --> 01:27:39,219
I think she's a little big
for a hand off.

Just one. One.
One big one for the clap.
