他來個小鳥低桿球
He birdies here,

00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,841
身著綠色上衣走開
he walks away with the green jacket.

5
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:50,442
靠
Fuck!

太好了
Wonderful.

7
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,600
你遲到了
You're late.

8
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:16,600
問問這個狗娘養等下我們有什么大不了的

9
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:25,600
告訴你老板  我會西班牙語
他再嘰嘰歪歪  我就干他娘的

10
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:31,183
-武器呢  -在船上  錢呢
- The weapons? - It's on the boat. The cash?

11
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:37,256
-有點輕哦  -先給4萬5千美元
- Feels a little light. - That's 45,000 now.

12
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:39,424
武器到手之后
The rest you'll get wired into an account of your choosing

13
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,326
-剩下的錢你給個賬號我網上轉賬給你  -不行  不行  不行
- once we get the weapons. - No, no, no!

14
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,662
這太扯淡了  我們事先可不是這樣說的
This is bullshit! This is not what we agreed on!

杰克  別往心里去
Don't take it too personal, Jack.

50

別騙自己了  搭檔  怎么能不在意呢
Don't kid yourself, partner. It's always personal.

51
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:44,900
順便問下  我干掉最后兩個家伙的時候
Ps, where the fuck were you

52
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:45,484
你死哪里去了
on those last two?

53
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:49,288
老大  基本射擊要領  槍目線過于模糊
Marksmanship 101, boss. Gun-target line was shit.

54
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,757
我射擊用的是點308麥格倫彈
I'm firing .308 win mags.

55
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,726
啊  對了  你頭發里沾了點腦漿
Oh, by the way, you got some brain in your hair.

56
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:58,697
-老天  -這個距離  一顆點308彈
- Jesus Christ! - At this range, a .308 woulda ripped right through

57
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,575
會直穿過你剛殺的"生意伙伴"
your recently deceased business partners

58
00:05:01,576 --> 00:05:03,302
在你胸口爆個大洞
and left you with a sucking chest wound.

59
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:06,438
幸好你沒干  好了  大伙兒撤吧
Well, good to know. All right, let's get the hell out of here.

60
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,373
馬上過來  老板大人
On my way, boss man.

61
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:19,618
那個帥小伙的彈夾有真子彈是怎么回事
What happened with Gabriel's rounds?

62
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,653
我搞不到他的備用彈夾
I couldn't get to his spare mags.

63
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,690
-他會注意到的  -會害死人的
- He would have noticed! - That could have been bad.

64
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:25,814
-差點而已
- Could have.

65
00:05:25,815 --> 00:05:28,060
順便說下  你這兩個家伙都是蠢材
You guys are fucking idiots, by the way.

66
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:31,797
空包彈這種計策玩多了會出事的
How many more times you think you're going to get away with this blanks shit?

67
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,799
你的語氣聽來好像很關心這事
Is that concern I hear in your voice?

68
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:36,368
當然  這可關系到我的前途啊
Yeah, concern for my future employment.

69
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,806
我的綜合技能在星巴克可找不到相應的職位
My skill set doesn't exactly translate to working at Starbucks.

70
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:43,709
我們走吧
Let's get out of here.

71
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:45,110
過幾個星期會再見面
I'll see you in a couple of weeks.

72
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,678
夠走運的話
If you're lucky.

73
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,648
得了  出點力嘛  一起來
Come on, let's see what you got. Come on. There you go.

74
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,517
嘿  嘿  嘿  別這么大力推我
Hey, hey, hey. Don't push me too hard.

76
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,742
能給我拿條毛巾嗎
Can you grab me a towel?

77
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,823
這是什么
What the fuck is this?

78
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:21,259
-你指什么  -這照片
- What the fuck is what? - This!

79
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,331
-你哪兒找到的  -簡娜會氣瘋的
- Where'd you find that? - Jenna would be pissed.

80
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:31,202
-簡娜和我僅僅...  -簡娜與我  給你糾正下
- Jenna and me have only-- - Jenna and I. I'm just saying.

81
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:35,006
簡娜與我才約會了幾個星期
Jenna and I have only been dating for a few weeks.

82
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,976
我要把這照片扔了
I'm throwing this out.

83
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:39,110
好  我不在乎  扔掉它吧
Fine. I don't care. Throw it out.

84
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:50,155
哇  印象深刻啊
Wow. I'm impressed.

85
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:52,924
說說看  最后一次聽到她的消息有多久了
When's the last time you heard from her, anyway?

86
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,627
不好說
I don't know.

87
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,899
六個月吧
Six months.

88
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:23,622
杰克  知道么  你可真是個沒骨氣的奇葩
You're a real nutless wonder, you know that, Jack?

89
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,259
實話說  你究竟看中了她什么
Honestly. What the hell did you ever see in her?

90
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:33,665
所有人趴下
Everybody down!

91
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:38,203
聽到沒  快行動
Get that. Let's go!

92
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:42,807
-愛德華  你好  -很高興你終于接了電話
- Hello, Edward. - So glad you picked up.

93
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,676
我正忙著呢
I'm kind of in the middle of something right now,

94
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:46,378
要不回頭打給你吧
so I'll probably just call you back.

95
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,780
我知道你在哪兒  也清楚你正在干什么
I know where you are and I know what you are doing.

96
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,115
難道你忘了
Or did you forget who planned

97
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,083
這一切最早出是誰的計劃嗎
this little trip in the first place?

98
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:52,985
艾迪  是你叫停它的
You called this job off, Eddie.

99
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:53,985
艾迪  是你叫停這個計劃的
You called this job off, Eddie.

100
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,087
所以你不能責怪我提前行事
So you can't blame me for going ahead with this.

101
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:57,248
我還是得責怪你
But I do blame you.

102
00:10:57,249 --> 00:10:58,923
你正在執行我醞釀成熟的計劃
You're doing a job that I planned.

103
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:00,613
這計劃是我從頭到尾設計好的
A job that I set up.

104
00:11:00,614 --> 00:11:02,060
你可要付我"中介費"哦
There are finder's fees associated with it.

105
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:05,030
你的計劃自己叫停  我決定繼續執行而已
Your job you called off and I decided to move forward with?

106
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:09,100
凱倫  沒我的首肯  沒我的參與
Without me. Without my permission, Karen.

107
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,236
愛德華  你要什么
What do you want, Eddie?

108
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:12,971
-我全部的分成  -那是多少
- My full share. - Which is?

109
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:16,107
-100%分成  -不是說好60%嗎
- One hundred percent. - What happened to 60?

110
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:19,844
另外40%算是你對我侮辱的補償
Well, the additional 40 is for the indignity that I have suffered.

111
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,714
沒門
No fucking way.

112
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:26,151
凱倫  別這么說
Yes fucking way, Karen.

113
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,119
你報了警嗎
You called the cops?

114
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,021
我還能怎么辦  你做的事真傷感情
What can I say? My feelings were hurt.

115
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,118
你將什么都得不到 
You'll get nothing.

116
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:32,123
早就想給你個難忘的教訓
A price I would gladly pay

117
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,859
這個代價我認為值得
to teach you a long overdue lesson.

118
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:47,038
現在  格倫
Now, Glenn,

119
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,041
跟我說說為什么你的領帶像沾過屎一樣
why is it that these ties look like they were dipped in shit?

120
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:54,913
-你是說屎嗎  費羅薩先生  -屎
- Shit, Mr. filosa? - Shit. Yes.

121
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:57,082
先生  你要求的深紅色樹狀條紋
Sir, you asked for Scarlet forest,

122
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:59,017
我確信這些領帶的顏色正是你要的
and I assure you these ties are all Scarlet forest.

123
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,119
-你跟我保證這顏色是對的嗎  -是的  先生
- You're assuring me that? - Yes, sir.

124
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:05,023
我跟你說這些領帶像沾過屎一樣
I'm assuring you that they look like they were dipped in shit.

125
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,862
看看這個
See this?

126
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:12,274
看看這個顏色
See this color?

127
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:15,900
等它干了  才是我想要的領帶顏色
When that dries, that's the color I want on these ties.

128
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:19,104
-是的  先生  -你可以走了
- Yes, sir. - Off you go.

129
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:25,616
假如凱倫能活著出來
If Karen makes it out alive,

130
00:12:25,617 --> 00:12:29,080
她將不得不搭乘原來那班飛機
she'll have no choice but to take her original flight.

131
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,483
把她知道的一切都給我挖出來
I need to know exactly what she knows.

132
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:33,785
明白  先生
Yes, sir.

133
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,224
只剩幾天功夫了
It's only a matter of days now.

134
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:43,394
這個計劃  我的計劃就在外面
This job, my job is right out there.

135
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:46,865
可不能讓凱倫給破壞了
We can't let Karen fuck it up.

136
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:57,408
-絕對不行  -為什么
- Absolutely fucking not. - Why not?

137
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,257
原因嘛  你借我狗狗
Why? 'Cause the fact that you borrow my dog

138
00:12:59,258 --> 00:13:02,213
只不過想討你那獸醫女友的歡心罷了
in order to trick your veterinarian girlfriend

139
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,249
一想到你是個動物愛好者就覺得可悲
to thinking you're an animal lover is pathetic.

140
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:07,552
我一向是動物愛好者  只不過沒養過寵物而已
I am an animal lover, I'm just not an animal owner.

141
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:09,338
你真的喜歡這個女人么
Do you even like this woman?

142
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:11,122
當然  我喜歡她  非常喜歡
Yes, I like this woman. I like her a lot.

143
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,825
那為什么一直對她撒謊
Then why do you continue to lie to her?

144
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:16,161
我撒謊是因為我愛她
I lie to her because I like her!

145
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:19,264
哈  哼  你說話像個需要慰藉的男人
Ha. Well, spoken like a true man.

146
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,067
別說了
Stop it.

147
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:29,808
明天上午把狗還給我
I want her home by morning.

148
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:40,118
前臺  是的  他在這兒  好  我轉告他
Reception. Yeah, he's right here. All right, I'll let him know.

149
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,017
她準備好見你了
She's ready for you.

150
00:13:41,018 --> 00:13:42,587
康納醫生跟海獅一起待在后面
Dr. Connor's in the back with a sea lion, okay?

151
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,346
起來  我們走
Let's go. Come on.

152
00:13:44,347 --> 00:13:46,424
啊  對了  她最喜歡雛菊
Oh. And daisies are her favorites.

153
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:51,129
-你懂的  下次帶上  -多謝相告
- You know, for next time. - Now you tell me.

154
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,968
干得好
Good job.

155
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,304
過來
Come on.

156
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:07,212
凱利  它今天好多了
She's doing much better today, Kerry.

157
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,916
醫生  我這里有個病狗狗
I have another patient for you, Doc.

158
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:16,187
嗨  格雷絲
Hi, Grace! Hi!

159
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,456
-我想它記得你  -應該是
- I think she remembers you. - I think so.

160
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,326
-這些花是給我的嗎  -對
- Are those for me? - Yes.

161
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:23,261
-愛煞玫瑰了  -噢
- I love roses. - Yeah.

162
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:26,531
-見面的事怎么樣  -我干掉了他們
- How was the conference? - I knocked them dead.

163
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,867
當然  我就知道
Of course. I knew you would.

164
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:31,135
-今晚共進晚餐好嗎  -唔...兩個條件
- How about dinner tonight? - Hmm... two conditions.

165
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:32,303
-盡管說  -你下廚
- Name them. - You cook.

166
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,639
-好說  -格雷絲得在場
- Done. - And Grace is there.

167
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,307
當然  格雷絲總賴在那兒
Of course. Grace will always be there.

168
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,276
-嗨  寶貝  -格雷絲  她是誰呀
- Hi, baby. Hi! - Who's that, Grace?

169
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:50,655
剛有手下給我電話  她已經到了機場
One of my men just called. They spotted her arriving at the airport.

170
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:53,191
-他們正跟蹤著她  -她一個人做不來
- They're following her now. - She can't do it alone.

171
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:56,094
-找出她的幫手  -好的  先生
- Find them. - Yes, sir.

172
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:48,279
格雷絲  格雷絲  閉嘴
Grace! Grace, shut up!

173
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:03,528
杰克...
Mm, Jack...

174
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,301
天啦  我靠
Jesus! Fuck!

175
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,970
嗨
Hi.

176
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:14,005
你來這兒干什么
What the fuck are you doing here?

177
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,975
杰克  很高興見到你
Good to see you too, Jack.

178
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,278
你懷孕了
Are you pregnant?

179
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,549
你家的剩菜看起來好美味  我去吃點
I'm going to go eat your leftovers 'cause they look delicious.

180
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:27,251
你倆接著辦事
And I'll let you two finish up here.

181
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:32,724
我得說一句  記得戴套套哦
Use a condom. That's all I'm going to say.

182
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:36,661
杰克  那女人是誰
Jack, who is that woman?

183
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:48,473
-喂  -我找到他們了  先生
- Yeah. - I found them, sir.

184
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:50,141
-好  -他們活不過明天早晨
- Good. - They'll be dead by morning.

185
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,543
-事情辦好  -是  先生
- Finish it. - Yes, sir.

186
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:22,040
-幾個月了  -有番茄醬嗎
- How many months? - Got any pickles?

187
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:26,310
-凱倫... -是你的孩子
- Karen... - It's yours.

188
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:31,783
我明白  剛開始那會兒我也拒絕接受事實
I know. I was in denial too for a little while.

189
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:34,318
哀傷的五個階段嘛  那是第一個階段
It's the first of five stages of grief.

190
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,187
-那么  有...-你TMD上哪兒去了
- Then there is-- - where the fuck have you been?!

191
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:38,523
接著是憤怒
Then there's anger.

192
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:41,392
-我得走了  -噢  簡娜...簡娜
- I'm going to go. - Oh! Jenna... Jenna.

193
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:45,096
簡娜  別  真對不起  你知道我
Jenna, please, I'm so sorry about this, you know... I...

194
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:47,799
格雷絲  別吵
Grace! Please!

195
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:49,400
-要我回頭給你電話嗎  -好  那當然
- Do you want to call me later? - Yes, of course.

196
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,336
等我一下  格雷絲  格雷絲  別叫了
Gimme a second. Grace. Grace, knock it off!

197
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:54,739
對不起  等我一下  我陪你...
I'm sorry. Just give me one second, I'll walk you...

198
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:58,409
格雷絲  得了  閉嘴
Grace! Come on, girl. Shut up!

199
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,083
噢  見鬼
Oh, shit!

200
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:09,720
簡娜  你得聽我的說
Jenna, I need you to listen to me.

201
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,689
馬上就有很危險的事情發生
Something very dangerous is about to happen.

202
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:14,759
別問任何問題  明白嗎
You can not ask any questions. Do you understand me?

203
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,494
-什么  -你剛提了個問題
- What? - That was a question!

204
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:45,756
槍  你有槍
Guns? You have guns?

205
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:48,326
杰克  那是個手雷嗎
Jack, is that a grenade?

206
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,698
怎么啦  杰克
What? Jack!

207
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,702
-你我之間得談談  -現在嗎
- You and me are going to talk. - Now?

208
00:18:57,704 --> 00:19:00,538
-快去船那兒  -快走
- Get to the boat. - Let's go.

209
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:31,636
追  行動  快行動
Move! Move! Move!

210
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,173
快點  簡娜  上船
Let's go! Come on, Jenna, get in the boat!

211
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:41,679
快  狗狗  快進來
Come on, girl! Let's go!

212
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:46,450
-凱倫  趴低  -在碼頭那兒
- Karen, get down! - The dock!

213
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,654
追  快追  快點追
Move, move, move!

214
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:57,528
快上船
Get on the boat!

215
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:29,527
-杰克  -凱倫  你等下
- Jack! - Give me a minute, Karen.

216
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,495
-但我... -你沒看到我豎起手指嗎
- Yeah, but i-- - did you see the finger?!

217
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:33,397
-杰克  我看到了  -豎著手指是說
- Yes, Jack, I see the finger! - Well, the finger means

218
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,186
我需要一分鐘時間思考
I need one minute to think!

219
00:20:36,187 --> 00:20:37,301
他們追上來了
Here they come!

220
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:43,241
你在做什么
What are you doing?

221
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,610
-我在打電話報警  -給我手機
- I'm calling the police! - Give me that!

222
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:47,612
別叫警察
There's no calling the police!

223
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,885
啊
Ah!

224
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,683
杰克  我們這是去哪里
Where are we going, Jack?

225
00:21:01,684 --> 00:21:03,461
簡娜  哪里安全去哪里
Somewhere safe, Jenna.

226
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,380
凱倫  好了  快說 
Okay, Karen, go.

227
00:21:07,381 --> 00:21:08,833
有人認為我偷了他的東西
Someone thinks I stole from him.

228
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:11,435
-凱倫  你偷了嗎  -什么
- Did you? Karen! - What?!

229
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,272
-你偷了人家東西嗎  -沒
- Did you steal from someone? - No!

230
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:17,775
上帝保佑  事前你怎么不仔細想想
Jesus Christ! Do you ever think anything through?!

231
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,186
哦  別跟我說做事魯莽那套屁話
Oh, don't talk to me about thinking things through!

232
00:21:20,187 --> 00:21:21,746
你總是想得多  做得少
You over analyze everything!

233
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:23,039
我喜歡事前計劃
I like to plan!

234
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,049
才不會像你這樣落到今天的境地
I like to plan so I don't get into shit like this!

235
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:29,720
別吵了  請把注意力轉到追殺者那兒
Please just pay attention to the people trying to kill us!

236
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:31,022
開快點  開快點  追上去
Faster! Faster! Let's go!

237
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,204
我在愛德華·費羅薩那里接了一個活兒
I ran a job for Eddie filosa.

238
00:21:35,205 --> 00:21:36,060
哦  這是第一個錯誤
Oh, mistake number one.

239
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:38,329
-你認識他嗎  -打過交道
- You know him? - I know of him.

240
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,767
出了岔子  事情沒做成
Well, the job went south and we lost the score.

241
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:44,468
再正常不過
Well, that happens.

242
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:49,874
哦  你去跟愛德華說吧  他要我賠償損失
Yeah, well, tell that to Eddie. He wants me to make good for it!

243
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:53,778
-所有損失嗎  -所有損失
- All of it? - All of it!

244
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,884
-多大  -非常大
- How big? - Huge!

245
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:01,324
這不合常理
That's not very rational.

246
00:22:01,325 --> 00:22:03,721
杰克  愛德華喜歡不按常理行事
Eddie's not exactly rational, Jack.

247
00:22:08,895 --> 00:22:11,729
-狗狗沒事吧  -沒事
- Is she okay? - She's fine.

248
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:14,441
羅根的狗跟著我們做什么
What is Logan's dog even doing here?

249
00:22:14,442 --> 00:22:16,067
格雷絲是羅根的狗嗎
Grace is Logan's dog?

250
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:18,936
-她還不知道嗎  -我正想告訴你
- She didn't know? - I was going to tell you.

251
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:21,505
杰克  你要講的是事實的哪一部分
You were going to tell me what part, Jack?

252
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:22,743
是關于格雷絲不是你的狗
That Grace isn't yours,

253
00:22:22,744 --> 00:22:24,542
還是關于你把前女友搞大了肚子
that you got an ex-girlfriend pregnant,

254
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:26,811
還是你是某種超級大罪犯
or that you're some type of uber-criminal?!

255
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:29,447
杰克  她說得有道理
She's got a point, Jack.

256
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:35,086
開快點  追上去
Come on, faster! Go!

257
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:43,828
你能干掉那個摩托艇嗎
Can you take out that jet ski?

258
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,731
這槍沒子彈了  當然我能干掉摩托艇
I'm out! Of course I can take out the jet ski!

259
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,972
你這槍有問題
There's something wrong with your gun!

260
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:56,707
凱倫  我的槍沒問題
There's nothing wrong with my gun, Karen.

261
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,376
哦  真的么
Oh, really?

262
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,411
那為什么不讓這位"當代女友"試試
Then why don't we let "this year's model" give it a try?

263
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:01,480
別太過分
Just leave her alone.

264
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:04,148
為什么  我懂了  她喜歡躲在后面避風頭
Why? I know she likes to just lay on her back,

265
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,950
也許她應該幫我們分擔點壓力
but maybe she wants to participate more.

266
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:08,686
杰克  你怎么看上這種女人的
What the hell did you ever see in this woman, Jack?

267
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:11,756
我接受他開著燈做愛的習慣  夠了吧
I gave him a reason to fuck with the lights on!

268
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:23,501
-杰克  -什么
- Jack! - What?

269
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:24,902
摩托艇都干掉了
There are no more jet skis.

270
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,971
壞消息是  槍也沒有了
The bad news, no more guns.

271
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:30,074
-還剩下什么  -霰彈槍
- What do we got left? - A shotgun.

272
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,145
這么遠的距離  打不中的
We're never going to hit them from this distance.

273
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:36,914
-我要讓船做平旋運動  -真的嗎
- I'm going to flatspin the boat. - Really?

274
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:40,618
就像巴西那次
Just like Brazil.

275
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:06,710
啊
Ah!

276
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,764
凱倫  你來掌方向
Karen! Take the wheel!

277
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:28,966
-把它弄出去  -快上
- Get her out of here! - Go!

278
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:35,039
杰克  你要干什么
Jack, what are you doing? Jack!

279
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:01,131
你他媽的
Fucking bitch!

280
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:23,888
-我靠  -天啦
- Oh, shit! - Oh, god!

281
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:42,740
操
Fuck!

282
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:48,913
格雷絲  過來這里  狗狗  快來
Grace, get over here, girl. Come on!

283
00:25:56,689 --> 00:26:00,624
你還好吧
Are you all right?

284
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,235
-簡娜  能跟你談幾句嗎  -好
- Jenna, can I talk to you for a minute, please? - Yeah.

285
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:16,974
我要你找個旅館住上幾天
I need you to get a hotel for the next few days.

286
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:19,076
請個病假  別告訴同事你去哪里
Call in sick to work. Don't tell them where you are.

287
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:21,045
不想去旅館  我要回家
I don't want to get a hotel. I want to go home.

288
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:23,047
我明白你現在有點不知所措
I understand you're a bit overwhelmed right now,

289
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:24,915
但我過去多次遇到這種情況
but I've been through these things in the past, a few times.

290
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,685
你一定要相信我
You're just going to have to trust me.

291
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:29,300
你一起來嗎
Are you coming with me?

292
00:26:29,301 --> 00:26:31,989
現在不行  過陣子我會來看你的
Not right now, but I'll come back to check on you.

293
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:34,024
你要跟她一起走么
Are you going somewhere with her?

294
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:36,927
很不巧  我得跟她去
Yeah. Unfortunately.

295
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,630
我得搞清楚究竟發生了什么  找出解決方案
I need to figure out what's going on. I need some answers.

296
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:41,365
跟你在一起可辦不成事
I'm not going to get those with you around.

297
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:43,734
-你要給她上水刑嗎  -不
- Are you going to waterboard her? - No.

298
00:26:43,736 --> 00:26:45,970
我不會給她上水刑的  我只是..
I'm not going to waterboard her, I just...

299
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:48,005
我只是不想讓你再進一步卷入事中
I just don't want you to get more involved than you already are.

300
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:50,307
我覺得你該給她上水刑
I think you should waterboard her.

301
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:55,045
好了  關于這一切...我非常抱歉
Okay. I'm sorry... About all this.

302
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:59,049
-我也是  -羅根明天早晨會來領格雷絲
- Me too. - Logan'll be by in the morning to pick up Grace.

303
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:00,884
好
Okay.

304
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:25,009
格雷絲  最慘的部分是  約會太糟糕了
The saddest part, Grace, I've had worse dates.

305
00:27:34,687 --> 00:27:37,321
嘿  你們中有人知道老板在哪兒嗎
Anyone seen the boss? Hey!

306
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,690
有人知道嗎
Anyone seen the boss?

307
00:27:39,692 --> 00:27:42,059
真像...
Like really...

308
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:44,328
搞什么  你們這幫小娘們
What the fuck? You bitches.

309
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:48,399
你搞什么  有病啊你  神經
What the fuck? What's your problem, psycho?

310
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:50,100
你  "****"
You. Dick breath.

311
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:52,670
嘿  別這樣子對我們說話
Hey! You can't talk to us like that.

312
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:54,304
你不服
Yes, I can.

313
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:55,338
你們有什么問題
What's the matter with you?

314
00:27:55,339 --> 00:27:57,274
你究竟在這兒干什么  女孩們
What the fuck are you doing, girls?

315
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:59,977
我來問你個問題  你們怎么理財的
Let me ask you a question. How do you invest your money?

316
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:02,446
-什么  -理財
- What? - Invest.

317
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:05,449
艾迪付你們錢的  對不  那些錢你們怎么用
Eddie pays you, right? What do you do with your money?

318
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:08,819
-用來買東西  -買些什么
- I buy shit. - You buy shit like what?

319
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:11,021
-鞋子  -鞋子  還有呢
- Shoes. - Shoes. And?

320
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,090
-漂亮的鞋子  -太好了  還有別的嗎
- Nice shoes. - Great. What else?

321
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:16,360
-胸前的大咪咪  -漂亮著呢
- These boobs. - They're nice boobs, by the way.

322
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:19,296
硬漢  有話直說  沒功夫跟你耗一天
What's your point, tough guy? We don't have all day.

323
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:23,867
我的意思是你們也許有兩三年功夫
My point is you got about two, maybe three more years

324
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:27,304
出賣自己的身體  然后呢
of whoring yourself out before a whole new batch of younger

325
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:30,708
等著一幫更年青漂亮的小妞
and prettier whores comes rolling in through that front door.

326
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,376
從那扇大門進來取代你們
And all you're going to have to show for it

327
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:36,046
而你們剩下的不過是滿柜的舊鞋子和破敗的身體
is a closet full of old shoes, and a banged up pussy.

328
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:40,818
如果我是女人  像你這般年青  這般好身材
Now, if I had a vagina, and I had your ass,

329
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,088
這般美貌  我肯定會攢錢攢到百萬身家
and your fucking tits, I'd be a fucking millionaire.

330
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:46,133
幸虧  好心的上帝保佑
Instead, the good lord blessed me

331
00:28:46,134 --> 00:28:47,991
我做了有道德感的男人
with a big dick and moral flexibility.

332
00:28:47,993 --> 00:28:52,062
所以...我只多問一次
So... I'm going to ask you one more time,

333
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:55,733
不給個滿意的回答我就狠狠地抽你們
or I swear to god I'm going to bitch-slap you so hard,

334
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:59,369
直到把你們打殘為止  明白嗎
your brand-new tits are going to pop out of your ass. Understood?

335
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:03,173
-艾迪在那兒  -小套房
- Where's Eddie? - The cabana.

336
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:05,242
女孩們  祝你們愉快
You girls have a good day.

337
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:11,415
我們認識彼此很長時間了
We've known each other a long time.

338
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:12,774
你從來不喜歡前戲
You've never been one for foreplay,

339
00:29:12,775 --> 00:29:15,219
要不你省下那些扯淡的話  跟我直說吧
so why don't you just spare me the bullshit.

340
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:18,856
告訴我你要什么
Tell me what you need.

341
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:24,194
-有個活兒  -我知道
- There's a job. - I knew it.

342
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:27,431
-杰克  聽我說完  -如果我沒記錯的話
- Just hear me out, Jack. - If I remember correctly,

343
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:31,201
凱倫  上次我幫你  差點進了班房
the last time I helped you out, Karen, I almost ended up on the wrong side of the grass.

344
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,337
沒記錯的話  你根本不怎么賣力
If I remember correctly, you weren't exactly putting up a fight.

345
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:35,439
凱倫  算了吧
Forget it, Karen.

346
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:39,243
杰克  我遇到麻煩了  真正的麻煩
I'm in trouble, Jack. Real trouble.

347
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:42,279
-不是真需要幫忙  我也不會在這兒  -別人
- I wouldn't be here unless I needed... - Someone.

348
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,916
...你  我需要你幫忙
...you. Unless I needed you.

349
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:48,514
杰克  我失去了整個團隊
I lost my entire crew, Jack.

350
00:29:48,515 --> 00:29:50,554
差點自己都沒能活著出來
I barely got out alive.

351
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:51,209
事情搞砸了
And I lost the score.

352
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:53,824
艾迪要我賠償所有損失  否則就殺了我
Eddie's going to kill me unless I pay him back.

353
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:57,161
這個活兒  大把的錢  小小的風險
This job? It's big money, small risk.

354
00:29:57,163 --> 00:29:58,987
如果我們辦成了
If we pull it off,

355
00:29:58,988 --> 00:30:02,232
就有足夠的錢付給艾迪  還...
it's enough money to pay back Eddie and...

356
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:05,002
...剩余不少
...and then some.

357
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:18,348
什么活兒
What's the job?

358
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:24,154
我喜歡國際象棋  完美地隱喻生活
I like chess. It's a perfect metaphor for life.

359
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:28,125
每顆棋子都有固定的位置和走法  就像我們
Every piece is bound to its nature, just like people.

360
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:31,094
-西蒙  你怎么看  -我不下棋
- What do you think, Simon? - I don't play.

361
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:34,164
你該學學的  鮑勃  你會嗎
You really should. What about you, Bob?

362
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:37,201
-我更喜歡玩撲克  -我喜歡撲克
- I'm more of a poker guy. - Yeah, I like poker.

363
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:40,270
也是個好游戲  都是關于把你想要的
Also a great game. All about trying to make the most of what you got--

364
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:44,041
當然  先生  你找我來這兒干什么
yeah, sure, Mr. f. Listen, could you tell me what I'm doing here?

365
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:46,977
耐心點兒  只耽擱你一點時間
Bear with me. This will just take a second.

366
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:50,013
我有個問題要問你  請把手放在圣經上
I want you to put your hand on this Bible. I have something to ask you

367
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,015
保證你所說的話句句屬實
and I want you to be perfectly honest with me.

368
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:55,519
-能知道原因... -請遷就一下
- Don't know why... - Indulge me.

369
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:01,735
我非常欣賞撲克
I appreciate poker.

370
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:05,329
它象征著希望  一種充滿夢幻
It's a game of hope. A game of dreams.

371
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:09,633
和謊言的游戲  但是國際象棋  象征著秩序
A game of lies. But chess, it's a game of order.

372
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:13,971
這個卒子只能向一個方向移動
This pawn can only move one way.

373
00:31:13,973 --> 00:31:18,375
向前移動  只能從斜對方吃掉對手的棋子
Move forward, can only take diagonally.

374
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:23,213
卒子努力工作  也許有一天能更進一步
And if it works really hard, it can become something better,

375
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,613
改變地位  就像你
something more. Like you.

376
00:31:25,614 --> 00:31:28,252
鮑勃  你就是個卒子
You're a pawn, rob.

377
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:32,222
卒子不能做的事包括不能泄密給敵人的王后
And what pawns do not do is tell secrets to the enemy queen

378
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,791
希望對方給陪他上床
in hopes that she'll fuck him.

379
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,359
先生  我從沒說過半句
Mr. f, I never said a word!

380
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:38,996
你要干什么  別  老天  我靠
What are you doing?! No! No! God! Fuck! God!

381
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:41,331
手掌里的神經多著呢
So many nerves in the hand.

382
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:44,334
老天  操  我什么都沒說
God! Fuck! God! I said nothing!

383
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:46,826
鮑勃  我們現在不是在玩撲克
We're not playing poker now, Robert.

384
00:31:46,827 --> 00:31:48,071
而是在玩國際象棋
We're playing chess.

385
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:51,375
我是國王  西蒙是我的騎士
I am the king, Simon is my knight.

386
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:53,377
別管它
Leave it.

387
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:57,047
如果你夠小心  愿意做出犧牲
You are a pawn, and if you aren't careful,

388
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:59,216
你才能成為一個小卒子  明白嗎
you are going to be sacrificed. Do you understand that?

389
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:02,252
-明白  明白  -現在  羅伯特
- Yeah. Yeah. - Now, Robert,

390
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,455
關于我近期的商業冒險
what exactly did you tell Karen

391
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:06,657
你具體告訴了凱倫哪些
regarding my latest business ventures?

392
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:10,227
-我跟她講了聯邦東部的活兒  -哦
- I told her about the eastern federal job. - Yes.

393
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:14,331
-還有開曼群島的活兒  -哦
- I told her about the Cayman Islands job. - Yes.

394
00:32:16,235 --> 00:32:19,336
還告訴了她關于裝甲車的事情
I told her about the armored car.

395
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:22,072
-裝甲運輸車  -是  是的  先生
- The armored car. - Yeah. Yes, sir.

396
00:32:22,074 --> 00:32:26,276
-那就是說  -就是說她什么事都知道
- That means... - That means she knows everything.

397
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,615
羅伯特這事我們怎么處理好呢
What are we going to do with Robert?

398
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,586
你會殺了我
You're going to kill me.

399
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:40,223
終究會的  對
Eventually, yeah.

400
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:42,326
終究會的
Eventually.

401
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:51,401
-裝甲運輸車  -是啊  差不多那樣
- Armored car? - Yeah. More or less.

402
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:57,274
-這運動很蠢  -值得一試
- It's a stupid sport. - It was a nice shot.

403
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:59,376
-別這么混賬  -給
- Don't be a dick. - Here.

404
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:06,249
你怎么想
So what do you think?

405
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:11,254
杰里·斯普林格  美國著名節目主持人

406
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:11,254
我想你絕對會在杰里·斯普林格的脫口秀中亮相的
I think you've definitely secured yourself a spot on the Jerry springer show.

407
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:15,258
-我是說這個活兒  -杰克  我懂你的意思
- I mean about the job. - I know what you mean, Jack.

408
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:18,996
跟她合作絕對沒什么好事
Nothing, and I mean nothing good,

409
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:21,298
沒什么好結果的  兄弟
can come from working with her, man.

410
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,334
-那孩子怎么辦  -你確定是你的種么
- What about the baby? - Are you sure it's even yours?

411
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:28,438
兄弟  她離開這么久  天知道跟誰搞在一起
She's been gone, man, shacking up with only god knows what.

412
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,576
-喂  喂  -對不起
- Hey, hey. - Sorry.

413
00:33:32,578 --> 00:33:36,346
我只是希望她變了性子
I just keep hoping she's changed.

414
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,616
她上單活兒搞砸之后
And after the last job that she had that went bad

415
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:42,019
懷著孩子來找我  只是...
and now the baby, I just...

416
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:46,323
覺得也許她最終會有所改變  想要...
Maybe she'll finally want something different, something... something else.

417
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:50,527
-直說吧  -我
- Just say it. - Me.

418
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:55,032
也許她最終想回到我身邊
Yeah. Maybe she'll finally want me.

419
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:58,468
格雷絲  過來這里  狗狗
Grace! Come here, girl.

420
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,171
過來  來這里
Come on. Come here.

421
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:02,851
變個貴賓犬的樣子看下
Be a poodle, Grace.

422
00:34:02,852 --> 00:34:05,509
格雷絲  來  變成傻不拉嘰的貴賓犬
Come on, be a little dumb-ass yippie poodle.

423
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:07,244
-來啊  -你在干嗎
- Come on. - What're you doing?

424
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:09,379
-證明我的觀點  -哦
- Proving a point. - Yeah?

425
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,481
-什么觀點  -我不可能把
- Which is? - That I have a better chance

426
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:14,351
格雷絲變成一只傻傻的貴賓犬
of Grace turning into some dumb-ass poodle

427
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:18,355
你也不可能把一個冷血又控制欲極強的小婊子
than you do of getting this cold-hearted, manipulative bitch

428
00:34:18,357 --> 00:34:21,191
變成安分守己的居家主婦
to settle down and live a normal life.

429
00:34:21,193 --> 00:34:23,693
你以為未出世的孩子會改變她的本性嗎
Oh, you think this kid is going to change who she is?

430
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:27,097
你以為那孩子會讓她變得愛你嗎
You think this kid is going to make her love you?

431
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:29,166
醒醒吧  朋友
Wake the fuck up, my friend.

432
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:33,270
她永遠是那個凱倫  懷上孩子改變不了她
She's always going to be Karen. Now she's just Karen with a kid.

433
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:38,508
嗯
Yeah.

434
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:41,411
知道我為什么留著那張照片嗎
You know why I keep that picture?

435
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:44,648
有一陣子我們總談論要搬到圣.約翰島去
There was a time when we used to talk about moving to St. John,

436
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,684
或其它類似的熱帶島嶼  開間潛水店
or some other tropical island, opening up a dive shop,

437
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:50,854
在世外桃源度過余生
living the rest of our lives in paradise.

438
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:52,556
就像海明威的小說里寫的那樣
Some real Hemingway-type shit.

439
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:54,658
那照片提醒著我為什么要...
And that picture was a reminder of why I do--

440
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,760
為什么我們要不停地爭論這些
why we keep doing what we're doing.

441
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:58,647
你總是說什么風險啊
You're just taking these risks,

442
00:34:58,648 --> 00:35:01,665
不義之財來之不易啊  但...
and making easy money the hard way, but...

443
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:05,368
我不能永遠這樣干下去
I can't keep doing this shit forever.

444
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,041
只要有機會
So if there's even the slightest chance

445
00:35:06,042 --> 00:35:07,671
哪怕一絲把這個白日夢變成真實的機會
that I can make

446
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:11,641
我也會想辦法抓住
that stupid fucking pipe dream a reality, I'm going for it.

447
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:17,114
羅根  你不欠我什么
You don't owe me anything, Logan.

448
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,350
別這么說
Don't say that.

449
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,487
別TMD這么說
Don't you fucking say that.

450
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:26,857
我們是朋友  不是嗎  關系就像一家人
We're friends, right? Practically fucking family?

451
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:30,560
-是啊  -那就沒什么欠不欠的
- Yeah. - Then it's not about owing me.

452
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:32,419
跟欠人情一點關系都沒有
It was never about that.

453
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,431
家人  朋友之間不談這個
It's what friends do, it's what family does.

454
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:36,633
家人...朋友之間就得互相支持
We... we back each other's plays,

455
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:39,469
哪怕從一開始就知道他們錯得離譜
even when we absolutely know they're fucked from the get go.

456
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:44,574
-對吧  -我猜是這么回事
- Right? - Yeah, I guess so.

457
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:49,579
不要說"我猜這么著"  事實就是這樣
Mm... no. No "i guess so." That's the way it is.

458
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:52,482
-那么  -那么
- So? - So?

459
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:55,452
讓我們放手去做吧
Let's do this.

460
00:35:55,454 --> 00:35:57,721
你為什么這般暴躁
Why are you so grumpy?

461
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,765
就是那輛卡車嗎
Is that the truck?

462
00:36:10,766 --> 00:36:13,436
對  運送著價值3千萬的寶石
That's the truck. 30 million in gems.

463
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:14,471
那是路線
That's the route.

464
00:36:14,473 --> 00:36:17,207
-兩天嗎  -就兩天
- Two days? - Two days.

465
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:24,281
-我們還得找個槍手  -必須的
- We're going to need a second gunman. - Definitely.

466
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:27,284
-還需要個好司機  -我知道上哪兒找
- We're going to need a driver. - I know where to find one.

467
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:31,655
-技術非常好的司機  -我知道上哪兒找
- A damn good driver. - I know where to find one.

468
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,544
德魯
Drew.

469
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,071

安德魯
Andrew.

470
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:00,250
安德魯·赫茨伯格
Andrew Herzberg!

471
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:11,328
杰克  真的是你  真不敢相信我的眼睛
Jack? Jack! Really? I can't believe what I'm seeing!

472
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,829
-兄弟  好久不見  -就這家伙嗎
- It's been a long time, brother. - - This guy?

473
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:15,232
這家伙能把卡車開到160英里時速嗎
This guy flew in the 160th?

474
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:16,900
一腳上去  直到歐藍德吉普前臉散架為止
Right up until breaking his commander's jaw.

475
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:21,972
噓...夜間跟蹤者不...
Sh... night stalkers don't--

476
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,880
有必要狂吐一番
that was completely necessary.

477
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:33,583
我百分百精神了
I feel a hundred percent.

478
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:38,050
什么風把你吹到泰國來了
What brings you to Thailand?

479
00:37:38,051 --> 00:37:39,356
我們在密西西比
We're in Mississippi.

480
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:40,890
真的嗎
Really?

481
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:43,893
怎么可能
No fucking way.

482
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:46,429
能拿片紙巾之類的東西給我嗎
Can we get a napkin or something?

483
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,732
-就那兒  -赫茨伯格
- Right there. - - Herzberg!

484
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:52,602
原來你在這兒  你這堆狗屎
There you are. You piece of shit!

485
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,671
-你又尿床了  -什么
- You pissed the bed again! - What?

486
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:56,840
你尿床了
Yeah. You pissed the bed!

487
00:37:56,842 --> 00:37:58,674
親愛的  我知道自己是成年人
Honey, I know I'm really big,

488
00:37:58,675 --> 00:38:00,277
但是  你懂的  這太傷人了
but, you know, it still hurts.

489
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:03,913
你聞聞  你聞聞  聞聞你的尿騷味
Smell it. Smell it! Smell your filthy piss!

490
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:07,717
-好  是我  沒錯  -哦  是嘛
- All right. Well, it is me. Definitely. - Oh, yeah.

491
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:11,421
聞起來像威士忌  像失敗者
Mm! It smells like whiskey, and failure,

492
00:38:11,423 --> 00:38:15,692
像不可救藥者  所有世界上最壞的東西
and sadness, and everything else bad in the world!

493
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:17,949
這家伙一團糟 
This guy's a mess.

494
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:20,430
比我上次見到他時強多了
He's doing much better than the last time I saw him.

495
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:22,332
別再問
Don't ask.

496
00:38:27,406 --> 00:38:29,806
那么  你意下如何  德魯
So, what are you thinking, drew?

497
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:33,076
你說的事情這輛寶貝應該做得來
I think this baby is capable of what you're asking for.

498
00:38:33,078 --> 00:38:36,780
相信我  兄弟  只需稍稍改裝幾處地方
I'll just need to make a few modifications, but you know me, man.

499
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:38,493
我就能把它開得飛起來
I can drive, fly, or fuck-- -

500
00:38:38,494 --> 00:38:39,716
你以為  還是你真懂
you think, or you know?

501
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:43,420
-抱歉  -這區別可大著呢
- Excuse me? - Yeah, there's a big difference.

502
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:45,588
你也許覺得自己是個了不起的司機
You may think you're one hell of a driver,

503
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,790
但我看到的只是個醉熏熏的酒鬼
but I know you're a drunk asshole.

504
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:49,092
她都不認識我
How could she possibly already know

505
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:51,728
-就敢斷定我是個混蛋  -有什么問題
- that I'm an asshole? - What's the problem?

506
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,098
我們計劃的成功與否
Our plan lies strictly

507
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:55,532
跟這個醉鬼司機的駕駛技術密切相關
on whether or not this drunk asshole can drive.

508
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:57,353
你難道不擔心嗎
That doesn't concern you?

509
00:38:57,354 --> 00:38:59,669
仍然沒根沒據地認定我是個混蛋
Again with the unsubstantiated asshole claim.

510
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,771
不  這我一點也不擔心
No. It doesn't concern me.

511
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:03,260
我見識過他的開車技術
Because I've seen him drive.

512
00:39:03,261 --> 00:39:04,641
我也見識過他能醉成什么樣子
And I've seen him drunk.

513
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:07,811
我從不醉酒開車  也許會喝得微醺
I never drive drunk. Buzzed, maybe.

514
00:39:07,813 --> 00:39:10,057
宿醉之后開車  那肯定有過
Hung-over, absolutely.

515
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:11,981
但醉酒開車  從未有過
But drunk, never.

516
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:13,999
哦  那我算松了口氣
Oh, that's a relief,

517
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,353
雖然這家伙還是滿嘔吐物的味道
coming from the guy whose breath still smells like puke.

518
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:18,788
我去車里等
I'll be in the car.

519
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:22,726
-她人不錯  -天氣不錯哈
- She's nice. - This is a good day.

520
00:39:37,743 --> 00:39:40,192
每次看到你這副硬漢模樣
You've any idea

521
00:39:40,193 --> 00:39:42,846
你知道在我眼里有多性感嗎
how sexy you are when you do your tough guy routine?

522
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:45,982
-都布置好了嗎  -當然  杰克  都布置妥當了
- Everything set? - Yes, Jack. Everything's set.

523
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:50,887
我喜歡你事事周到
I love how you worry about every single detail

524
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,156
在意每一個細節的樣子
right up until the last minute.

525
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:55,492
-凱倫... -嗯哼
- Karen... - Mm-hm?

526
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:57,060
別
Stop.

527
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:01,765
我不能
I can't.

528
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:04,567
-是因為怯懦小姐嗎  -她才不怯懦
- Because of Ms. milquetoast? - She's not milquetoast.

529
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:05,682
得了  杰克
Come on, Jack.

530
00:40:05,683 --> 00:40:07,771
這女的就像香草  很普通無聊的
That girl is madame vanilla. Boring.

531
00:40:07,773 --> 00:40:10,874
不是普通不普通的問題
It's not about madame vanilla.

532
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:14,711
真的跟簡娜沒關系  只跟...
It's not about Jenna, it's about...

533
00:40:14,713 --> 00:40:17,514
-是我們的問題  是因為你  -嗯哼
- It's about us, it's you. - Mm-hm.

534
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:22,719
我要的  你要的  完全不一樣
And what I want, what you want and how that is... Completely different.

535
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:26,623
我不認為你我的需求有多不同
I don't think that what we want is that much different.

536
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:47,744
還缺個槍手
You don't have a second gunman.

537
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:49,779
你知道我有多能干
You know that I'm more than capable.

538
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,615
絕對不行
Absolutely not.

539
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,651
-是我的活兒  -不行
- It's my job. - No.

540
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:55,919
我應該在卡車上
I should be on that truck.

541
00:40:55,921 --> 00:40:58,755
如果你參與其中  我就撒手不干
If you're on this job, I walk, I'm gone.

542
00:40:58,757 --> 00:41:00,523
那誰去
Then who?

543
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:03,726
安德魯有個朋友
Andrew has a guy.

544
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:06,596
-哦  你相信他么  -我相信
- Oh, and you trust him? - Yeah. I trust Andrew.

545
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:07,831
好
Fine!

546
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:18,775
價值三千萬的鉆石在那輛卡車里嗎
Thirty million in gems on this truck?

547
00:41:18,777 --> 00:41:21,744
對  價值三千萬的鉆石
That's right, 30 million in gems.

548
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:25,982
-在黑市能賣個二千萬吧  -也許不止
- We'll get 20 on the market. - Maybe more.

549
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,785
就算二千萬
Let's just count on 20.

550
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:30,086
你欠艾迪八百萬
You owe Eddie eight.

551
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:34,991
還剩一千二百萬我們五個人分
That leaves roughly 12 for the five of us.

552
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,863
說得沒錯
That's correct.

553
00:41:42,601 --> 00:41:44,834
然后呢
And then what?

554
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:55,144
去圣.約翰島買個房子
Well, then a house in St. John.

555
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:03,720
那個槍手  他叫什么名字
Who is it? Our second gunman?

556
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:05,016
尼古拉斯·西弗
Nicholas sepher.

557
00:42:05,017 --> 00:42:07,790
安德魯參軍的時候就認識他了
Andrew knows him from his time in the army.

558
00:42:17,836 --> 00:42:20,837
叫你別那么干  女人  別干
Don't you fucking do it, woman. Don't you do it!

559
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:22,272
誰讓你給你前妻發短信呢
Maybe you should have not texted your ex-wife.

560
00:42:22,274 --> 00:42:24,841
她母親死了  別那么干
Her mother died! Do not fucking do it!

561
00:42:24,843 --> 00:42:26,287
你會下地獄的
You can die in hell.

562
00:42:26,288 --> 00:42:27,877
一天到晚忍受你這嘮叨婆
Oh, hell would be fucking paradise

563
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:31,648
我還是去地獄好了  那里才是伊甸園
compared to being married to you!

564
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,016
安德魯跟我說過那個活兒
Andrew told me about the job.

565
00:42:33,018 --> 00:42:34,984
我還沒說完呢
We're not done with our talk.

566
00:42:34,986 --> 00:42:37,287
兄弟  算上我
I'm in, man.

567
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:39,923
你要去  好啊  真傷透我的心哪
Yeah, you're in, all right, for a whole new world of hurt.

568
00:42:39,925 --> 00:42:41,891
-你還沒聽細節呢  -不需要也不關心
- You haven't heard the details. - I don't need to. I don't care,

569
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:43,293
赫茨伯格去就行了
as long as it involves herzberg, it's going to get me

570
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:44,994
至少能讓我遠離這個家一段時間
the fuck outta this house for a while.

571
00:42:44,996 --> 00:42:47,030
我們這個家哪里惹著你了
And what the hell's so wrong with our house?

572
00:42:47,032 --> 00:42:48,665
-這活危險嗎  -當然
- This thing fairly dangerous? - Sure.

573
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:49,966
-杰克  對吧  -對
- It's Jack, right? - Yeah.

574
00:42:49,968 --> 00:42:51,901
杰克  我想念過去的生活
Well, Jack, I miss my life.

575
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:55,738
我還想找個硬漢子呢  總得有人做出犧牲 
I miss getting fucked by a real man. We all make sacrifices.

576
00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:01,711
你能閉嘴嗎  不然掐死你
I will choke a bitch. Can you shut the fuck up?!

577
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:04,047
等著吃槍子吧
I hope you get shot.

578
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:06,883
杰克  看著我的眼睛  你看我快樂嗎
Look in my eyes, Jack. Do I look happy to you?

579
00:43:06,885 --> 00:43:09,286
希望有人一槍打爆你的丁丁
I hope you get dick shot. -

580
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:10,887
你看看  每天都這樣
It's this. Every day.

581
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:12,956
一槍爆掉你
The worst kind of shot.

582
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,860
-杰克  你結婚了嗎  有孩子  -咦
- You married, Jack? You got kids? - Ish.

583
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:21,230
-啊  兄弟  那感覺糟透了  -尼古拉斯
- Yeah. Well, it sucks, man. - Nicholas.

584
00:43:21,232 --> 00:43:24,067
周圍的每個人都開開心心的  除了我自己
Because everybody's happy except me. Me?

585
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:26,102
-尼古拉斯  -兄弟  我正想找個理由
- Nicholas! - Oh, man, I'm just looking for a reason

586
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:28,371
重新操上武器打爆某人的腦袋
to put a gun back in my hand, and a bullet in someone else's brain

587
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:30,707
在這之前  請告訴我
before I put one in my own. So tell me,

588
00:43:30,709 --> 00:43:32,609
我們要對付的家伙  他們夠壞嗎
are the guys we're going up against, are they bad?

589
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:34,978
-不要臉的大公司  -太妙了
- Faceless corporation. - That's even better.

590
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,946
-尼古拉斯  -什么事
- Nicholas! - What?!

591
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:38,583
我有陰虱  會傳給你的
I'm going to give you crabs.

592
00:43:38,584 --> 00:43:39,782
夠了  把你的東西打包
That's it. Pack your shit.

593
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:42,785
帶上那些貓狗  從我的房子里滾出去
Take those fucking rat dogs and get out of my house!

594
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,821
有一條狗可是你的哦  狗雜種
One of those dogs is yours, cocksucker.

595
00:43:44,823 --> 00:43:48,091
我看起來像養拉布拉多狗的人嗎
Do I look like I wanted a fucking labradoodle?!

596
00:43:48,093 --> 00:43:50,125
它可是我們的寶貝
She's our baby.

597
00:43:50,126 --> 00:43:52,362
我要在你的筆記本上撒尿
I'm going to piss on your laptop.

598
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:54,964
她真會干的  抱歉
She will. Excuse me.

599
00:43:57,669 --> 00:43:59,636
他做得來
He'll do.

600
00:44:02,107 --> 00:44:03,940
前面的守衛  后面的守衛
Guard in the front. Guard in the back.

601
00:44:03,942 --> 00:44:05,775
不是系統當天指定的司機
Anyone who tries to drive this thing

602
00:44:05,777 --> 00:44:07,243
試圖駕駛這卡車的話
other than the driver assigned for that day,

603
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:10,079
生物識別系統會自動讓發動機熄火
biometric system automatically kills the engine.

604
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:11,795
卡車將再也不能啟動  明白嗎
Can't be restarted. Okay?

605
00:44:11,796 --> 00:44:13,082
我們有20分鐘左右的時間
We got 20 minutes or less.

606
00:44:13,084 --> 00:44:14,872
最新科技的保險廂體
State-of-the-art vault.

607
00:44:14,873 --> 00:44:16,986
一旦鎖上  只能從內部打開
Once it's locked, only gets open from the inside.

608
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:21,024
想暴力切開它  得花上一個小時
It takes us about an hour, an hour to cut through.

609
00:44:21,026 --> 00:44:22,659

尼克  我們做個預演
Let's run through this. Nick.

611
00:44:25,964 --> 00:44:29,098
我阻止卡車

-我做掉守衛  -玻璃可是防彈的
- I take out the guard. - The glass is bulletproof.

613
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,970
呵  我用的可不是子彈
Well, it's a good thing I ain't using bullets.

00:44:33,972 --> 00:44:36,973
-你用的是什么  -火花塞

這些寶貝打爆防彈玻璃
These babies will break bulletproof glass

616
00:44:38,226 --> 00:44:39,976
像我老婆捏爆我的蛋蛋一樣簡單
like my wife breaks my balls.

617
00:44:39,978 --> 00:44:43,246
-羅根  -給隊伍提供掩護

駕駛一輛拖車
I drive the tow truck.

620

你忘記裝甲車了
You forgot the armored car.

621
00:44:53,469 --> 00:44:54,891
對  下次一定記得

625
00:45:05,003 --> 00:45:07,470
就喜歡你這個樣子
Just the way I like them.

626
00:45:07,472 --> 00:45:08,395
我還沒搞懂
I still don't know

627
00:45:08,396 --> 00:45:10,373
你們計劃怎么弄開卡車的保險車廂
how you plan on breaking into the truck's vault.

628
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:13,209
那可是個驚喜哦
Because it's a surprise.

629
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,311
-哦  -我喜歡驚喜

630
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:18,247
大家都喜歡驚喜  對吧  伙計們
Mm-hm. We all like surprises, right, guys?

631
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:26,456
-羅根  -我不喜歡你  也不相信你
- Logan? - Yeah. Look, I don't like you, I don't fucking trust you.

632

你明天在說好的位置等
You be where you're supposed to be tomorrow.

車加滿油  隨時可以走
Car fueled up, ready to go.

- I'll be there. - That's good to hear. Because if you're not,

635

我會找到你  等著你的孩子出生
I'll find you, wait for that fucking kid to be born,

636
00:45:36,735 --> 00:45:40,303
受洗囡包  再給你個哥倫比亞式的死亡
and give you a Colombian necktie as a belated baby shower present.

637
00:45:40,305 --> 00:45:44,841
好生動形象  你的意思已轉達  沒別的事吧
Graphic, but it gets your point across. Are we done?

638
00:45:44,843 --> 00:45:46,476
不  話還沒說完
No, we're not fucking done.

639

他現在跟簡娜的關系好著呢
He's got a great thing going with Jenna.

640
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,079
你別給他添亂
He doesn't need you fucking it up.

641
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:51,881
難道你不認為
You don't think that he should be

642
00:45:51,883 --> 00:45:53,850
他應該跟更好的人在一起嘛
with someone like that any more than he does.

643
00:45:53,852 --> 00:45:56,052
換個說法  如果你給他添亂
Let me rephrase. You fuck this up,

644
00:45:56,054 --> 00:45:58,788
利用了杰克的話  我會殺了你
you fuck over Jack, and I'll kill you.

645
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:01,157
你廢話真是太多了
Now you're just being redundant.

646
00:46:41,065 --> 00:46:45,201
套上去  好朋友  就像過去那樣
Get on there, my little friend. Yeah. Like old times.

647
00:46:51,176 --> 00:46:53,442
注意了  朋友們  好戲開場啦

-尼克  準備好  -行動吧
- You ready, Nick? - Let's rock and roll.

649
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:18,367
怎么回事
What's going on?

650
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:22,471
靠
Fuck!

651
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:28,344
嘿  老兄  麻煩低下頭

655
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:12,188
快  開動  退一點  停住  就那兒
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. Let's go. Come back. Back. Hold! Right there.

656
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:28,471
做好準備
Get ready.

657
00:48:28,473 --> 00:48:30,206
德魯  好了  目標到手
All right, drew. We gotta bounce.

658
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:31,407
快走
Let's go!

659
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,917
走
Let's go.

660
00:48:55,233 --> 00:48:58,034
杰克  有三輛車子朝你的方向駛去
Jack, you got three vehicles headed your way.

661
00:48:58,036 --> 00:49:00,937
7個...
And seven...

662
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:02,505
只剩6個壞家伙了
Six bad guys.

663
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:20,407
三輛車跟著我們
We got three on us.

664
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:22,258
Welcome to the suck
美國大兵的口頭語

665
00:49:20,408 --> 00:49:22,258
歡迎來到槍彈紛飛的世界
Welcome to the suck.

666
00:49:26,531 --> 00:49:28,331
左  左轉
Left! Go left!

667
00:49:30,335 --> 00:49:32,969
-右邊有輛車跟上來了  -看到了
- We got one on the right. - I got him.

668
00:49:53,024 --> 00:49:55,424
靠  為什么壞家伙總是有自動武器
Shit! Why do the bad guys always have automatic weapons?

669
00:49:55,426 --> 00:49:58,227
不好說  我正進入狀態呢
I don't know, but I'm getting hard!

670
00:50:10,308 --> 00:50:12,141
-打中了嗎  -搞定一個  剩兩個
- You got him? - One down. Two to go.

671
00:50:12,143 --> 00:50:13,376
杰克  看我的
There you go, Jackie boy!

672
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:26,756
見鬼
Shit!

673
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:35,364
打中了嗎  杰克
You got him, Jackie boy!

674
00:50:44,442 --> 00:50:46,442
靠近點
Get me closer.

675
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:11,500

-再近點  -人呢  怎么看不到
- Closer! - Where are they? I can't see them.

676
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:12,735
好  向前開
All right. Drive.

677
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:21,177
糟  看不到人
Shit, I don't see them!

678
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:23,479
走  走  左邊  左邊
Go! Go! On the left! On the left!

679
00:51:24,382 --> 00:51:26,816
哇
Whoa!

680
00:51:32,523 --> 00:51:33,556
那兒  就那兒
There. Right there!

681
00:51:59,517 --> 00:52:02,351
天啦
Oh, god!

682
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:06,122
我操
Ah! Fuck!

683
00:52:10,728 --> 00:52:12,328
糟糕  快踩剎車
Oh, shit! Brake!

684
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:26,408
-哇噢  -哇
- Oh! Yeah! - Whoo!

685
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:28,444
干得好
That a boy!

686
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:40,256
杰克  在這兒擠滿警察之前
Jackie boy! We got about 15 minutes

687
00:52:40,258 --> 00:52:42,424
-我們有15分鐘  -兩分鐘就夠了
- before this place is swarming with cops. - I just need two.

688
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:43,759
要不要給你電弧熱噴槍
You want me to get you a thermal Lance?

689
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:46,195
不需要進到里面去
I don't need to get in.

690
00:52:46,197 --> 00:52:47,796
把他趕出來就行了
I just need this guy to want out.

691
00:52:55,206 --> 00:52:56,705
別搞了
Stop it!

692
00:53:03,447 --> 00:53:06,815
手放背后  肚子朝下  肚子朝下趴地上
Hands behind your back! On your stomach! On your stomach!

693
00:53:06,817 --> 00:53:09,418
手放背后  趴下
Hands behind your back! Down!

694
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,295
我了個去  好棒
Holy dingle berries!

695
00:53:19,297 --> 00:53:21,530
-這值一大筆錢啊  -凱倫說的沒錯
- That's a lot of coin. - Just like Karen said.

696
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:26,702
凱倫說的沒錯
Yeah. Just like Karen said.

697
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:28,537
好了  快離開這里
All right. Let's get out of here.

698
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:45,788
-杰克  該撤了  -好
- Come on, Jack. Let's rock and roll. - Yeah.

699
00:54:44,415 --> 00:54:46,415
老板大人  你去哪兒
Where you going, boss man?

700
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:49,051
我有點事要查查  應該沒啥
I just want to check something out. It's probably nothing.

701
00:54:49,053 --> 00:54:52,354
你們先走吧  我...我會趕上來的
Just keep going, I'll... I'll catch up with you.

702
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:13,809
你可太心靈手巧了  總是奇跡不斷啊
You were always a miracle worker with your hands.

703
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:16,612
換作我五分鐘內肯定解不開
It would have taken me at least five minutes. Hey!

704
00:55:16,614 --> 00:55:19,682
請不要亂動
Just stop right there.

705
00:55:19,684 --> 00:55:22,451
-艾迪  現在怎么著  -還能怎么著
- So, what happens now, Eddie? - What happens now?

706
00:55:22,453 --> 00:55:24,133
把那個小小的黑盒子乖乖地雙手奉上
You're going to give me that little black box,

707
00:55:24,134 --> 00:55:24,787
就是我要你做的
that's what happens now.

708
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:28,724
-然后呢  -然后嘛  可以放你一條生路
- Then what? - And then what? Then you get to live.

709
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:33,662
-艾迪  -什么
- Eddie! - What?

710
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:35,698
放她走
Let her go.

711
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:40,536
大英雄  把槍放下
Put the gun down, hero.

712
00:55:40,538 --> 00:55:42,771
把槍放地上  踢過來給我
Put the gun down and kick it over here towards me.

713
00:55:42,773 --> 00:55:44,620
杰克  別那么干 
Don't do it, Jack.

714
00:55:44,621 --> 00:55:46,775
沒人問你的意見  閉上你的嘴
Nobody asked you your opinion, so shut the fuck up!

715
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:47,867
大英雄  別擔心
Don't worry, hero.

716
00:55:47,868 --> 00:55:49,912
對你來說  她也許甜美體貼
With you, she might have liked it all sweet and gentle,

717
00:55:49,914 --> 00:55:52,681
但對我而言  她更喜歡被粗暴對待
but with me, she liked it a little bit rougher.

718
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:55,818
對不對  親愛的
Mm. Isn't that right, sweetheart?

719
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:58,921
把槍踢過來
Kick it over here to me!

720
00:56:03,761 --> 00:56:07,963
你給他承諾了什么  承諾了什么
What did you promise him. Huh? What did you promised him?

721
00:56:07,965 --> 00:56:12,701
錢  性  還是別的
Money? Sex? What?

722
00:56:14,972 --> 00:56:18,006
不對
No.

723
00:56:18,008 --> 00:56:23,145
他不知情  對不
He doesn't know? No.

724
00:56:23,147 --> 00:56:26,749
你個賤人
You bitch.

725
00:56:26,751 --> 00:56:30,753
我給你看樣東西  看樣東西
Let me show you something. Let me show you something.

726
00:56:33,391 --> 00:56:36,425
-艾迪  -這就是你關心的嗎
- Eddie. Eddie... - This? Is that what you're talking about?

727
00:56:36,427 --> 00:56:38,660
艾迪  求你了  別
Eddie, please, no.

728
00:56:39,597 --> 00:56:41,063
艾迪  艾迪
Eddie. Eddie!

729
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:42,131
跟肚子里的小寶貝說再見吧
Say bye-bye to the baby.

730
00:56:42,133 --> 00:56:43,465
艾迪  別開槍
Don't do it, Eddie.

731
00:56:44,402 --> 00:56:45,868
不要
No!

732
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,739
哦  不  怎么沒小孩
Oh, no! No baby!

733
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:54,810
哦  不  居然沒人受傷
Oh, no. No one's hurt.

734
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:58,747
開羅群島那個活兒
So you did make it out

735
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:00,816
你還是做成了嘛  滾過去吧
of the Caymans with something. Get over there.

736
00:57:00,818 --> 00:57:03,552
我猜她只是利用你搞到我手中的這個玩意
Guess she needed you to screw me out of this.

737
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:07,823
杰克  我已就位  但無法準確射擊
Jack, I'm in position, but I can't get a clean shot.

738
00:57:10,161 --> 00:57:12,694
-三... -真可惜
- Three... - - Shame really.

739
00:57:12,696 --> 00:57:14,029
假如情況不同
If things were different,

740
00:57:14,031 --> 00:57:16,098
你我合作能賺大錢
we could have made a lot of dough, you and me.

741
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:21,069
-二... -杰克  真是太可惜了
- Two... - Well, it's a real shame, Jack.

742
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:24,640
一  聽你號令
One. On your go.

743
00:57:24,642 --> 00:57:26,775
有時候事情就是辦不成
Sometimes things just don't work out.

744
00:57:28,913 --> 00:57:30,546
趴下
Down now!

745
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:38,754
-杰克  -快走
- Jack! - Let's go!

746
00:57:57,041 --> 00:57:58,674
快撤
Let's roll!

747
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:03,579
-對  撤吧  -羅根  該撤了
- Yeah, let's go! - Logan, let's go.

748
00:58:29,807 --> 00:58:34,009
-啊  -羅根  快來
- Ah! - Come on, Logan. Let's go.

749
00:59:01,272 --> 00:59:05,641
她失血過多  應該送她去真正的醫院
She's lost a lot of blood. You guys should take her to a real hospital.

750
00:59:05,643 --> 00:59:07,743
這不行
We can't.

751
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,179
簡娜  感激不盡
Jenna, I can't thank you enough.

752
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:14,249
你務必星期一之前離開這兒
Just be out of here by Monday.

753
00:59:15,286 --> 00:59:18,720
杰克  別再給我電話
And Jack, don't ever call me again.

754
00:59:31,702 --> 00:59:34,903
杰克會對凱倫發多大的火呀
I wouldn't want to be Karen right about now.

755
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:36,772
女人嘛
Women.

756
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:43,579
值得嗎
Was it worth it?

757
00:59:44,715 --> 00:59:46,682
嗯
Hm?

758
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:53,255
我在問你呢  值得嗎
I asked you a question. Was it worth it?

759
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:55,479
杰克  今天這一切真不在我的計劃之內
None of this was my plan, Jack.

760
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:56,692
那你的計劃是什么  凱倫
What was the plan, Karen?

761
00:59:56,694 --> 00:59:58,413
把我殺掉嗎
Was I supposed to get killed?

762
00:59:58,414 --> 01:00:00,896
不  按計劃你會得到三千萬
No. You were supposed to get 30 million.

763
01:00:00,898 --> 01:00:02,931
那假懷孕是怎么回事
What about the fake pregnancy?

764
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:06,101
-我得確定  -確定什么  什么
- I had to make sure. - For what? For what?!

765
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:09,605
為了這玩意  這玩意嗎
For this? Hm? This?

766
01:00:09,607 --> 01:00:12,040
這個小玩意  它干什么用的
This little thing? What is this?

767
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:14,676
-鑰匙  -解鎖什么
- A key. - To what?

768
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,379
上帝幫我  凱倫
God help me, Karen!

769
01:00:17,381 --> 01:00:20,182
你現在可沒有肚子里的嬰兒作倚仗
You don't have the baby inside to protect you.

770
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:22,918
一個保險柜
A safe.

771
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:29,291
另一個活兒嗎
This is for another job?

772
01:00:33,263 --> 01:00:36,064
保險柜里的貨價值多少
And how much is in this safe?

773
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:38,100
唔  肯定不止三千萬
Hm? It has to be a lot more than 30 million.

774
01:00:38,102 --> 01:00:39,401
五千萬  七千五百萬嗎
We're talking 50? 75?

775
01:00:39,403 --> 01:00:42,037
-五億  -我操  你就扯吧
- Half a billion. - Oh, fuck! Bullshit.

776
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:43,672
紅鉆
Red diamonds.

777
01:00:43,674 --> 01:00:45,841
CIA黑色行動繳獲的
CIA black op.

778
01:00:45,843 --> 01:00:48,944
五百萬一克拉  一百克拉價值五億
Five million a carat, 100 carats, 500 million.

779
01:00:48,946 --> 01:00:50,746
載著保險柜的飛機將于明天抵達
The plane with the safe flies in tomorrow,

780
01:00:50,748 --> 01:00:53,148
加個油  然后飛走
just long enough to refuel, and then it's gone.

781
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:56,118
懂了  我懂了  那我們怎么下手
Oh, I see. I see. And what were you going to do?

782
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:58,420
走進去直接拿鉆石嗎
Just walk in there and take them?

783
01:00:58,422 --> 01:01:01,056
計劃中本來應該沒人受傷的
No one was supposed to get hurt.

784
01:01:01,058 --> 01:01:03,659
羅根中彈了
Logan did.

785
01:01:03,661 --> 01:01:05,994
可以看出  你根本不在乎
Yeah, I see, not that you fucking care!

786
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:07,227
整個團隊被盯上
I just earmarked my entire team.

787
01:01:07,228 --> 01:01:09,998
進了死亡名單  艾迪會一直追殺我們
We have a death mark on us. Eddie's going to hunt us down.

788
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,835
-都是拜你所賜  -我真不是有意的
- So thank you very much! - I never meant for this to happen!

789
01:01:20,678 --> 01:01:23,378
你手提包里的超聲波圖是怎么回事
What about that sonogram I found in your purse?

790
01:01:25,883 --> 01:01:29,418
那是真的  但孩子沒能留住
It was real. But I lost the baby.

791
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:32,888
是我的嗎
Was it mine?

792
01:01:45,903 --> 01:01:48,103
去偷鉆石吧  好好干一票
Go get your diamonds. Have a nice life.

793
01:01:48,105 --> 01:01:52,441
帶著那五億  有多遠滾多遠
With half a billion, you can afford to stay the fuck out of mine.

794
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:28,537
羅根  我真不想說
Come on, Logan. I could really use

795
01:02:28,538 --> 01:02:32,314
"我早告訴你不要這樣"之類的話
that "i told you so" look right about now.

796
01:02:51,969 --> 01:02:55,437
-我覺得你應該吻她的前額  -你說什么
- I think you should kiss her on the forehead. - What?

797
01:02:55,439 --> 01:03:00,208
我是說  你該親她一下之類的
I don't know. I mean, I feel like you should kiss her or something, you know?

798
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:03,979
-伙計  你這是  -讓她有被愛的感覺
- Dude, have you-- - make her feel like she's loved.

799
01:03:03,981 --> 01:03:05,914
她不信那套騙人的玩意
She's not into that sappy shit.

800
01:03:05,916 --> 01:03:08,917
真的嗎  老天  她都昏迷不醒了
Really? Jesus, she's sleeping.

801
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:09,918
還能拿你怎樣
I mean, what is she going to do?

802
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,254
打爆你的臉  這就是她想干的
She'll break your fucking face. That's what she'll do.

803
01:03:12,256 --> 01:03:19,227
嘿  歡迎回到人間  感覺如何
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Welcome back. How you feeling?

804
01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:21,296
像在鬼門關走了一遭
Like I went dancing with a claymore.

805
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:24,132
噢  寶貝  寶貝
Oh, baby! Oh, baby!

806
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:26,596
你怎么上這兒來了  寶貝
What are you doing here, babe?

807
01:03:26,597 --> 01:03:28,136
真對不起  是...
I'm sorry. Is it...?

808
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:31,273
沒事  寶貝  只是傷到了腿
No, no, baby. It's just my leg. Mm! It's just my leg.

809
01:03:31,275 --> 01:03:33,475
感謝上帝  我上次不該說那些話的
Thank god! I didn't mean what I said.

810
01:03:33,477 --> 01:03:35,277
我知道  我知道你是愛我的丁丁
I know. I know you love my dick.

811
01:03:35,279 --> 01:03:38,413
-對不起  我... -這是你帶來的嗎
- I'm sorry. It's... - What did you bring me?

812
01:03:38,415 --> 01:03:42,250
噢  杰克  我在門口發現了這東西
Oh. Jack, this was on the front doorstep for you.

813
01:03:42,252 --> 01:03:47,088
-是什么來著  -某種遙控器和一個手機
- What is it? - Some kind of remote and a cell phone.

814
01:03:54,865 --> 01:03:58,867
杰克
Jack.

815
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:03,138
你怎么走得這么急  好想念你這個好朋友
My new best friend jerk off. You left in such a hurry.

816
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:04,973
艾迪  什么事
What can I do for you, Eddie?

817
01:04:04,975 --> 01:04:07,609
看來凱倫也不是那么冷血嘛
Turns out Karen isn't the cold-hearted bitch

818
01:04:07,611 --> 01:04:11,146
她今天來了我的酒店
we made her out to be. She stopped by my hotel

819
01:04:11,148 --> 01:04:13,982
帶著你手里正拿著的那玩意  跟我賠禮道歉
with what you now hold in your hands. Tried to make amends.

820
01:04:13,984 --> 01:04:16,184
試圖說服我這一切都是她的錯
Tried to tell me that it was all her fault,

821
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:20,255
求我不要找你和你那幫社會脫節分子的麻煩
to leave you and your merry band of misfit hoods out of this.

822
01:04:20,257 --> 01:04:24,002
過來  親愛的  打個招呼吧 
Here. Say hi, sweetheart.

823
01:04:24,003 --> 01:04:25,126
杰克  快逃
Just run, Jack.

824
01:04:25,128 --> 01:04:28,530
說得對  杰克  快逃  有多快跑多快
That's right, Jack. Run. Run as fast as you can.

825
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:31,633
也許我不會讓我手下追殺你
I probably won't use my considerable resources to find you

826
01:04:31,635 --> 01:04:35,503
-并滅了你  -這種威脅我聽得多了
- and put you down. - It's not the first time I've been threatened.

827
01:04:35,505 --> 01:04:39,374
沒人威脅你  只是想跟你談個交易
Nobody's threatening you yet. I'm offering you a trade.

828
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:42,010
你以為我在乎啊  讓她爛在地獄里吧
She can rot in hell, for all I care.

829
01:04:42,012 --> 01:04:44,279
不得不承認你說的可能是實話
That's probably an undeniable fact.

830
01:04:44,281 --> 01:04:47,349
但這取決于你  是讓她明天就開始腐爛發臭
But it's up to you whether she starts her stint tomorrow,

831
01:04:47,351 --> 01:04:50,051
還是50年之后  杰克  你說呢
or 50 years from now. Come on, Jack.

832
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:55,090
我給了你一個實實在在的機會哦  看你怎么做了
I'm giving you a real opportunity here. Impress me.

833
01:04:57,628 --> 01:05:00,395
大伙兒能給我倆幾分鐘嗎
Can you guys give us a minute?

834
01:05:01,498 --> 01:05:04,499
我能看出你為什么喜歡他
I can see why you like him.

835
01:05:04,501 --> 01:05:06,268
艾迪  他不會幫你做這事的
He's not going to do the job, Eddie.

836
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:08,403
等著瞧
We'll see.

837
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:12,641
上帝啊  互相信任就這么難嗎
Jesus. That must have been hard.

838
01:05:12,643 --> 01:05:15,043
不懂你的意思
I don't follow.

839
01:05:15,045 --> 01:05:19,314
靠  要她相信別人這么難
It must have been hard for her. Fuck.

840
01:05:19,316 --> 01:05:23,585
我本不想說的  她把這一切搞砸了
I hate to be the one saying this. She fucked up.

841
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:25,487
很徹底
Big time.

842
01:05:25,489 --> 01:05:28,223
但她至少敢挺身而出
But she at least tried to do the stand-up thing

843
01:05:28,225 --> 01:05:29,925
向艾迪獨攬罪過
and come clean to Eddie.

844
01:05:29,927 --> 01:05:32,394
她還是想收拾爛攤子的
She tried to wipe our slates clean.

845
01:05:32,396 --> 01:05:34,930
做這些需要勇氣  她可以選擇不做的
That took guts. She didn't have to do that.

846
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:40,335
不對  她自己闖下的禍  得由她自己解決
No. She got herself into this mess. She can get herself out.

847
01:05:40,337 --> 01:05:42,671
-做件混賬事  -什么
- Be a douche-bag. - What?

848
01:05:42,673 --> 01:05:46,241
-做件混賬事  -你說啥
- Be a douche-bag. - What?

849
01:05:47,308 --> 01:05:49,447
不管你多么想做混賬事
No matter how hard you try to be a douche-bag

850
01:05:50,308 --> 01:05:52,447
杰克  你還是成不了那種人
Jack, you're not a douche-bag.

851
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:57,452
從你救我的那天起  我就意識到這一點
I knew that the moment you saved my life.

852
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:59,454
你不肯放棄我
You could have let me down.

853
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:03,258
你也不會放棄凱倫  有沒有孩子都一樣
You can't let Karen down, baby or no baby.

854
01:06:05,595 --> 01:06:07,295
不  不  不  不  不  不
No, no, no, no, no, no.

855
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:09,513
這次不行  明白嘛
Not this time. Okay?

856
01:06:09,514 --> 01:06:12,334
你睡在床上休息  等事情過去
You're going to sit this one out.

857
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,473
什么活兒
What's the job?

858
01:06:21,712 --> 01:06:24,980
鉆石  價值五億
Half a bil, in diamonds.

859
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:30,719
為什么就不能只是搶個本地的珠寶店呢
Why can't it ever just be a local jewelry store?

860
01:06:43,433 --> 01:06:46,468
那是摩根機場  俗稱"落腳點"
That's Morgan airfield, the proverbial stomping ground

861
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:49,337
這機場是給所有機密任務  黑色行動用的
for all things clandestine and black ops.

862
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:53,341
飛機將于17小時內抵達  降落并加滿油
Our plane lands in 17 hours. Touches down for a refuel only,

863
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:55,410
我們有15分鐘的時間
giving us a window of 15 whole minutes.

864
01:06:55,412 --> 01:06:58,146
我們需要做的是  在這段時間內
And all we gotta do in that time is walk in,

865
01:06:58,148 --> 01:07:00,215
闖進飛機  打開保險柜
board the plane, crack the safe,

866
01:07:00,217 --> 01:07:03,451
獲取目標  然后大伙兒一起把東西帶出來
download the score, and get the flock out of there.

867
01:07:03,453 --> 01:07:05,620
你說得很具體  看起來很有把握
You say it like that, it almost sounds doable.

868
01:07:05,622 --> 01:07:08,356
就說我們到了機場附近
Say we even get onto this airfield here,

869
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:10,525
知道機場地面有多少守衛要對付嗎
do we know how many guards we're going to be dealing with on the ground?

870
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:13,128
不知道  只能走一步看一步
No. We'll have to figure that out in real time.

871
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:16,464
我是說  是50個還是100個守衛
I mean, but are we talking like 50 guards, or are we talking like 100 guards?

872
01:07:16,466 --> 01:07:17,005
首先
First things first.

873
01:07:17,006 --> 01:07:19,434
我們得想辦法在不中彈的情況下靠近機場
We gotta get onto that airfield without getting shot.

874
01:07:19,436 --> 01:07:23,304
我在做事呢  你說怎么辦吧
I'm working. Okay? How are we going to do that?

875
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:28,309
-馬尼拉  -馬尼拉
- Manila? - Manila?

876
01:07:28,311 --> 01:07:30,003
那次情況好像不怎么理想哦 
Didn't work out too good for you there.

877
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:31,413
也許這次能大展雄威呢
Maybe second time's the charm.

878
01:07:31,415 --> 01:07:32,514
究竟誰是馬尼拉
Who the hell is Manila?

879
01:07:32,516 --> 01:07:35,517
-她真可愛啊  -呵
- She's adorable. - Yeah.

880
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:39,187
好了  德魯  讓他們忙乎吧  我去準備
All right, drew. Keep them busy while I get to work.

881
01:07:42,259 --> 01:07:45,727
-你看那個小丑  -想吃點冰淇淋嗎
- Check out this clown. - Want some ice cream?

882
01:07:46,363 --> 01:07:48,329
搞什么飛機
What the fuck?

883
01:07:55,739 --> 01:07:58,506
杰克  大門安全了  你可以行動了
The gate's clear, Jack. You're good to go.

884
01:07:58,508 --> 01:08:01,176
阿普薩拉  記住  按尼克說的做
Apsara, remember, just like Nick showed you.

885
01:08:01,178 --> 01:08:05,547
瞄準卡車  開槍就行
Aim for the truck and just pull the trigger.

886
01:08:05,549 --> 01:08:07,682
別開槍  別開槍
Hold your fire. Hold your fire!

887
01:08:12,856 --> 01:08:17,725
誰想舔一舔  過來啊  冰淇淋大甩賣
Anyone want a lick? Come get your ice cream! Come!

888
01:08:17,727 --> 01:08:22,363
你穿著什么呢  這幫狗娘養的最好跑快點
What are you wearing? Fuckers better run.

889
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:31,372
快  快  快
Move, move, move!

890
01:08:59,336 --> 01:09:01,536
好了  要給力啊  寶貝
All right, come on, baby.

891
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:13,515
見鬼
Shit!

892
01:09:14,751 --> 01:09:18,286
-杰克  杰克  -再說一遍
- Jack! Jack! - Say again?

893
01:09:18,288 --> 01:09:21,322
你得離開  快
You gotta go. Move!

894
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:25,360
我還在想你會不會出現呢
I was wondering if you were going to show up.

895
01:09:25,362 --> 01:09:28,596
哪里出差錯了  艾迪認為我做不來嗎
What's wrong? Eddie doesn't think I can do the job?

896
01:09:28,598 --> 01:09:29,908
不如說是他不敢確定
Let's just say he wasn't sure

897
01:09:29,909 --> 01:09:31,933
凱倫在你心目中是否比五個億更占份量
Karen was worth the half a billion.

898
01:09:31,935 --> 01:09:36,304
別把垃圾當寶貝
One man's trash and all.

899
01:09:36,306 --> 01:09:38,439
你害我等了好久
What's taking so long?

900
01:09:39,543 --> 01:09:41,910
你行  你上啊
You think you can go faster, be my guest.

901
01:09:56,459 --> 01:10:00,528
-有主意嗎  -有
- Got any ideas? - Yeah.

902
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,197
一個
One.

903
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:07,769
啊
Ahh!

904
01:10:45,242 --> 01:10:48,843
-你欠我一次休假  -好說
- You owe me a vacation! - Fine.

905
01:10:48,845 --> 01:10:51,412
二次休假
Two vacations.

906
01:11:13,737 --> 01:11:15,586
杰克  你太讓我失望了
Jack. You are a disappointment to me.

907
01:11:15,587 --> 01:11:17,772
凱倫還有臉說你是最棒的
Karen said you were the best.

908
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:20,708
引用她的原話"米開朗基羅般的竊賊"
"The Michelangelo of thieves," to be exact.

909
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:22,377
我想最近可能有點生疏了
I may be getting a little rusty.

910
01:11:22,379 --> 01:11:23,711
沒事  反正你也活不了多久
It's all right. Soon you'll be dead.

911
01:11:23,713 --> 01:11:26,748
先讓我一槍爆了凱倫的臉再說
Right after I shoot Karen in the face.

912
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:29,917
說得好精彩  但你還是先耐心等等吧
Well, that's graphic. But you might want to just wait on that.

913
01:11:29,919 --> 01:11:31,653
你的耐心可能值五億美元哦
Could be worth half a billion dollars.

914
01:11:31,655 --> 01:11:33,788
要我提醒嘛  鉆石可在我手上
In case you missed it, I have the diamonds.

915
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:36,324
只要飛機一著陸
If the situation were reversed,

916
01:11:36,326 --> 01:11:38,660
你就插不上手了
even I couldn't get them back once they land.

917
01:11:38,662 --> 01:11:40,328
那是因為你不是米開朗基羅
That's because you're not Michelangelo.

918
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:42,797
艾迪  知道嘛  這些隨機密鑰生成器
You see, Eddie, the problem with those keygens,

919
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:44,899
很高明的玩意  要破解它
as remarkable as they are, they take forever.

920
01:11:44,901 --> 01:11:47,035
15分鐘的加油時間遠遠不夠
Way more than the 15 minutes I had for refueling,

921
01:11:47,037 --> 01:11:49,470
但你知道怎樣做更快嗎
but you know what goes real fast?

922
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:50,605
塞姆汀炸藥
Semtex.

923
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:24,672
牛仔  你的話我在聽
Okay, cowboy. You have my attention.

924
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:25,742
帶上鉆石到...
Bring the diamonds to-- -

925
01:12:25,743 --> 01:12:27,642
-別討價還價  我會通知你地址
negative. I'll call you with a location.

926
01:12:27,644 --> 01:12:30,511
看來你忘了我手里有你的女人
You seem to forget that I have the girl.

927
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:33,481
你也忘了  在我眼里她就是個婊子
And you seem to forget she can be a real bitch.

928
01:12:33,483 --> 01:12:37,552
值不了五個億
It might not be worth a half a billion dollars to me.

929
01:12:37,554 --> 01:12:40,988
杰克  好吧  按你說的來
Okay, Jack. Have it your way.

930
01:13:08,418 --> 01:13:10,718
這女人真值得你在乎嘛
Your boy's got some sand.

931
01:13:13,056 --> 01:13:16,724
-你怎么還沒死  -心死而已
- You're not dead yet? - Only on the inside.

932
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:24,031
-杰克  對不起  -好感人的重聚
- I'm sorry, Jack. - Cozy little reunion.

933
01:13:24,033 --> 01:13:26,067
打開它
Open it up.

934
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:29,704
我可做不到  密鑰生成器丟了
Yeah, I can't. Keygen's gone. I lost it in the fall,

935
01:13:29,706 --> 01:13:33,441
你這般神通廣大的人  肯定會想到辦法的
but a man with your resources, I'm sure you can figure a way into it

936
01:13:33,443 --> 01:13:36,043
把它搬回你那受隱私保護的家  或是總部 
in the privacy of your own home, or lair,

937
01:13:36,045 --> 01:13:38,880
找個混蛋幫你打開吧
or whatever assholes like you have.

938
01:13:40,817 --> 01:13:43,718
杰克  還有個小問題  我得殺了你
Oh, Jack. There's still the little matter of me killing you.

939
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:47,455
我們有約在先
We had a deal.

940
01:13:47,457 --> 01:13:49,710
我從不跟偷我東西的賊做交易
I don't make deals with people that steal from me.

941
01:13:49,711 --> 01:13:51,159
對生意影響太壞了
It's not good for business.

942
01:13:51,161 --> 01:13:53,995
-我有狙擊手  -狙擊手完蛋了
- My sniper. - Your sniper's fucked.

943
01:13:53,997 --> 01:13:55,355
什么都聽不到吧
Can't hear anything.

944
01:13:55,356 --> 01:13:57,732
我干擾了這里的所有通訊信號
I'm jamming all signals transmitting out of here.

945
01:13:57,734 --> 01:14:01,869
想走出這個地方  門都沒有
And I hope you don't think for one second I'm going to step out from under this thing.

946
01:14:01,871 --> 01:14:03,438
不對
Nope.

947
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:06,674
趴下
Get down!

948
01:14:08,711 --> 01:14:11,512
帶他出去  快走
Get him out of here! Go! Come on!

949
01:14:13,216 --> 01:14:15,082
他們朝樓頂方向跑了
They're headed for the roof.

950
01:14:15,084 --> 01:14:18,653
凱倫  跟上
Karen, move!

951
01:14:27,764 --> 01:14:29,831
警局  需要我幫你轉接嗎
911, how can I direct your call?

952
01:14:29,833 --> 01:14:32,066
剛聽到一聲爆炸  聲音非常大  我覺得
We just heard a bomb, really big, and I think...

953
01:14:32,068 --> 01:14:34,902
老天  一大幫人帶著槍沖進了酒店
Oh, my god! There's a whole bunch of men with guns in my hotel.

954
01:14:34,904 --> 01:14:39,707
女士  警車正趕向案發地點  請安心等待
Okay, ma'am. We have vehicles responding right now. Just sit tight.

955
01:15:09,873 --> 01:15:12,540
警局  需要我幫你轉接嗎
911, how can I direct your call?

956
01:15:12,542 --> 01:15:15,009
好  警車正趕往案發地點
Yeah, we have vehicles responding to you right now.

957
01:15:25,955 --> 01:15:27,622
跑  跑  跑
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

958
01:15:33,563 --> 01:15:35,997
跑  跑  跑
Go! Go! Go!

959
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:43,571
-去樓頂  -杰克  真不要我幫忙嗎
- Get to the roof. - You sure don't need me, Jack?

960
01:15:43,573 --> 01:15:46,204
當然  我一個人就行 
I'm sure I don't need you.

961
01:15:46,205 --> 01:15:47,708
杰克  你需要我
You need me, Jack.

962
01:15:56,986 --> 01:16:00,655
糟糕
Ah! Shit!

963
01:16:02,025 --> 01:16:04,759
杰克  沒子彈了嗎
Out of ammo, Jack? Huh?

964
01:16:06,195 --> 01:16:09,864
緊張么
Getting nervous?

965
01:16:26,049 --> 01:16:27,281
操你媽的
Fuck you!

966
01:16:33,957 --> 01:16:37,858
杰克  過來啊  狗雜種
Get over there, Jack! Fucker!

967
01:16:48,338 --> 01:16:49,870
我搞得定
I had him!

968
01:16:52,742 --> 01:16:54,308
把槍給我
Give me the gun.

969
01:16:55,078 --> 01:16:57,612
你個...
Son of a...

970
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,921
-多謝幫忙  -杰克  你又欠我一次休假
- Thanks for the help. - You owe me three vacations, Jack.

971
01:17:06,923 --> 01:17:09,657
看來你的休假已經開始了
Looks like you're starting now.

972
01:17:22,071 --> 01:17:24,872
兄弟  快點  要走啦  快
Move! Let's go, man! Come on!

973
01:17:25,742 --> 01:17:27,908
站住
Stop!

974
01:17:28,645 --> 01:17:31,946
站住  這一切
Stop! All of this,

975
01:17:31,948 --> 01:17:33,994
就是為了爬上樓頂被亂槍掃死
just to get shot up here on this roof.

976
01:17:33,995 --> 01:17:34,949
這就是你的計劃嗎
That's your plan?

977
01:17:34,951 --> 01:17:37,385
去你的
Ish.

978
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:48,763
-?  -吃老娘一槍  混蛋
- Bang! - Eat a dick, asshole.

979
01:18:10,253 --> 01:18:11,686
走吧
Come on!

980
01:18:30,139 --> 01:18:35,476
飛機會帶你去邁阿密  之后你想去哪都行
This will take you to Miami and then... wherever you need to go.

981
01:18:35,478 --> 01:18:37,812
杰克  你總能事事想周到
You always take care of everything, Jack.

982
01:18:37,814 --> 01:18:40,347
你的分成
Your cut.

983
01:18:41,451 --> 01:18:43,317
有點少哦
Seems a little light.

984
01:18:43,319 --> 01:18:46,287
如果你愿意的話  可以跟羅根談談
You can take it up with Logan if you'd like.

985
01:18:47,223 --> 01:18:48,989
不了
No, I'll manage.

986
01:18:48,991 --> 01:18:52,827
-凱倫  再見  -杰克...
- Goodbye, Karen. - Jack...

987
01:18:52,829 --> 01:18:55,496
-承認吧  -承認什么
- Admit it. - Admit what?

988
01:18:55,498 --> 01:18:57,736
你思念我  你思念這種感覺
You missed me. You missed this.

989
01:18:57,737 --> 01:19:00,935
長久以來只有這種感覺才讓你重新鮮活起來
This is the most alive you've felt in a long time.

990
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:08,476
-承認吧  -承認什么
- Admit it. - Admit what?

991
01:19:08,478 --> 01:19:13,781
你自投羅網就是為了利用我們偷鉆石和殺艾迪
You turned yourself in so we would have to steal the diamonds and kill Eddie.

992
01:19:16,052 --> 01:19:21,422
我說過的  杰克  你總是事事想得周到
Like I said, you always take care of everything, Jack.

993
01:19:44,413 --> 01:19:46,413
凱倫  再見
Goodbye, Karen.

994
01:19:54,991 --> 01:19:56,991
再見  杰克
Bye, Jack.

995
01:20:41,571 --> 01:20:45,172
喔  吼  吼  吼
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

996
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:48,342
你在看什么
What are you looking at?

997
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:52,112
真不敢相信你就這樣白白給她奉上五百萬美金
I can't believe you just handed her five million dollars.

998
01:20:52,114 --> 01:20:54,582
-是她該得的  -才不是
- She earned it. - Like hell she did.

999
01:20:54,584 --> 01:20:57,518
就當是你射傷她的補償吧
Consider it a severance package for you shooting her.

1000
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,127
那是個意外
That was an accident.

1001
01:20:59,128 --> 01:21:03,490
"基本射擊要領  槍目線過于模糊"
"Marksmanship 101, boss. Gun target line was shit."

1002
01:21:04,594 --> 01:21:07,228
你知道人們怎么形容站街女嗎
You know what they say about hookers.

1003
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:13,601
杰克  我不知道人們怎么說的  解釋一下
No, Jack. I don't know what they say about hookers. Enlighten me.

1004
01:21:13,603 --> 01:21:14,994
你付錢不是為了做愛
You don't pay them for sex.

1005
01:21:14,995 --> 01:21:17,271
而是為了讓她們離開  這叫花錢買平安
You pay them to leave.

1006
01:21:17,273 --> 01:21:21,375
老板  很合理  就是為了晚上睡個安穩覺嘛
Justify it however you need to in order to sleep at night, boss.

1007
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:24,645
-也可以說我是軟心腸  -我說你是個蠢蛋
- Call me a softy. - I'll call you an idiot.

1008
01:21:24,647 --> 01:21:29,884
羅根  把今天這番話當做絕妙友誼的開端吧
Logan, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

1009
01:21:29,886 --> 01:21:32,353
真的嗎  我覺得更像是某件事的結局
Really? I see it more as an ending.

1010
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:53,374
-羅根好嗎  -她很好  謝謝
- How's Logan? - She's good. Thanks.

1011
01:21:53,376 --> 01:21:58,545
-這小狗是誰的  -我的
- And whose puppy is this? - It's mine.

1012
01:21:58,547 --> 01:22:03,517
對了  我...有書面證明
Uh, yeah, I... have proof.

1013
01:22:03,519 --> 01:22:06,353
我料到你會問起的  它叫羅伊
I figured you'd ask. His name is Roy.

1014
01:22:06,355 --> 01:22:07,625
杰克  我...
Jack, I...

1015
01:22:07,626 --> 01:22:09,590
簡娜  聽我說  請再給我一次機會
Look, Jenna, I was hoping for a second chance.

1016
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:12,313
-我明白也許不值得你... -值得
- I know I don't deserve one-- - deserve?

1017
01:22:12,314 --> 01:22:14,128
你是說值得嗎
You want to talk about deserve?

1018
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:17,264
杰克  我是不喜歡凱倫  但那也不應當成為
Jack, I know I don't look like Karen, but that doesn't mean I deserve

1019
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:19,199
你那樣對待我的理由
to be treated the way you treated me.

1020
01:22:19,201 --> 01:22:22,236
騙了我好幾個星期  我都差點因你而死
You lied to me for weeks. You almost got me killed.

1021
01:22:22,238 --> 01:22:25,205
-我... -讓我把話說完
- I... - Just let me finish.

1022
01:22:25,207 --> 01:22:27,374
是的  我非常喜歡你
Okay, I liked you, a lot.

1023
01:22:27,376 --> 01:22:32,246
你嘴甜  體貼  風趣  聰明  有紳士風度
You were sweet, caring, gentle, funny, smart.

1024
01:22:32,248 --> 01:22:34,315
在我眼里你還是擁有這些品質的
And then you were still all of those things,

1025
01:22:34,317 --> 01:22:37,551
但同時也是愛惹事生非的大壞蛋
but also this incredible bad-ass.

1026
01:22:37,553 --> 01:22:41,221
這點其實非常性感
Which was actually really sexy.

1027
01:22:41,223 --> 01:22:44,391
假如你想再次約我出去
But if you want to ask me out again, you're going to have to do more

1028
01:22:44,393 --> 01:22:47,061
買一條小狗  送些鮮花是遠遠不夠的
than just buy a puppy and show up with flowers.

1029
01:22:47,063 --> 01:22:48,529
簡娜  我...我不是...
Jenna, I... I don't--

1030
01:22:48,531 --> 01:22:50,297
好  要不以這個做為開始吧
okay, how about this for starters.

1031
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:52,366
帶上你的小狗
You come to my office in a few weeks,

1032
01:22:52,368 --> 01:22:55,402
過幾個星期來辦公室找我
with your new puppy, and if bad men haven't shown up

1033
01:22:55,404 --> 01:22:57,324
如果那時沒有帶著槍的壞人
with guns to kill the poor little innocent puppy

1034
01:22:57,325 --> 01:22:59,406
找上門來殺掉可憐無辜的小狗
by then,

1035
01:22:59,408 --> 01:23:01,468
也許你有機會約我共進晚餐
then maybe we have a chance at having a dinner date

1036
01:23:01,469 --> 01:23:04,411
槍林彈雨  摩托艇追逐是絕對不允許的
without bullets and boat chases.

1037
01:23:04,413 --> 01:23:07,982
-成交么  -成交
- Deal? - Deal.

1038
01:23:07,984 --> 01:23:11,452
然后
And then, after an indefinite number of dinner dates,

1039
01:23:11,454 --> 01:23:15,289
假設沒有大肚子的前女友找上門來
assuming that no pregnant ex-girlfriends show up,

1040
01:23:15,291 --> 01:23:17,157
沒有人再追殺我們
and no one shoots at us,

1041
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:21,328
我也沒找到你撒謊的蛛絲馬跡
and if I don't catch you in any more lies,

1042
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:23,564
在共度無數個晚餐約會的夜晚之后
you can somehow manage all of that,

1043
01:23:23,566 --> 01:23:27,501
可能  僅僅是可能
then maybe, just maybe,

1044
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:31,372
我會給你個開著燈做愛的理由
I'll give you a reason to fuck with the lights on.

1045
01:23:36,045 --> 01:23:40,381
就說她會喜歡你的
Told you she'd like you. Yeah.

1046
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:44,752
哦  杰克  "要不一起共進晚餐"總比
Well, "how about we go to dinner" is better than,

1047
01:23:44,754 --> 01:23:49,423
"去你媽的  我要叫警察了"  強多了
"go fuck yourself, Jack, I'm calling the cops."

1048
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:03,370
-喂  -我不確定你會接電話
- Hello? - I didn't know if you'd pick up.

1049
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:05,272
真不知道是你打來的
I didn't know it was you.

1050
01:24:06,442 --> 01:24:09,343
是我自做自受
I deserve that.

1051
01:24:09,345 --> 01:24:11,045
凱倫  你要說什么
What do you want, Karen?

1052
01:24:11,047 --> 01:24:13,080
我在圣約翰島買了幢房子
I bought that house on St. John.

1053
01:24:13,082 --> 01:24:15,082
很美  靠近水邊
It's beautiful. It's on the water,

1054
01:24:15,084 --> 01:24:16,517
就像我們說過的那樣
just like we talked about.

1055
01:24:16,519 --> 01:24:19,353
我甚至打算買一間潛水店
I'm even looking into buying a dive shop.

1056
01:24:19,355 --> 01:24:23,157
我為你感到開心  真的  但我不...
I'm happy for you, I really am, but I don't see...

1057
01:24:23,159 --> 01:24:25,426
見鬼  杰克  我真的不擅長道歉
Goddamn it! I'm no good at apologizing, Jack.

1058
01:24:25,428 --> 01:24:28,362
我從沒就任何事給任何人道過歉
I've never apologized to anyone for anything.

1059
01:24:28,364 --> 01:24:31,498
我的意思是  我應該道歉的  只是...
Well, I mean, I was supposed to, I just...

1060
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:35,169
只是說不出口
I just didn't.

1061
01:24:35,171 --> 01:24:38,405
杰克  事情過去之后  我變了很多
Jack, something changed me all through all this, you know,

1062
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:41,542
看到我給你帶來的傷害  我...
seeing the pain that I caused you, I...

1063
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,546
我想跟你在一起
I want to be with you.

1064
01:24:45,548 --> 01:24:49,416
這房子  這些錢  沒了你就...
This house, the money, without you it's...

1065
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:52,219
...就真心無聊啊
...it's boring.

1066
01:24:52,221 --> 01:24:54,126
杰克  你知道怎么樣才不無聊嘛
But you know what's not boring,

1067
01:24:54,127 --> 01:24:56,390
怎樣才能永遠不無聊嗎  你我呆在一起
you know what's never boring, Jack? Us.

1068
01:24:56,392 --> 01:25:00,661
-你太孤獨了  凱倫  找  -我愛你
- You're lonely, Karen. Find-- - I love you.

1069
01:25:00,663 --> 01:25:03,597
杰克  我愛你  這份感情直到永遠
Jack, I love you. I think I've always loved you.

1070
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:08,836
我知道你也是愛我的  我們可以再復合
And I know you love me. We could make this work.

1071
01:25:08,838 --> 01:25:11,538
我們會幸福的
We could be happy.

1072
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:15,409
會幸福的
We can be happy.

1073
01:25:15,411 --> 01:25:17,711
杰克
Jack.

1074
01:25:17,713 --> 01:25:20,147
杰克
Jack?

1075
01:25:21,217 --> 01:25:22,583
杰克
Jack?

1076
01:25:27,389 --> 01:25:30,691
-打錯電話了  -說得準沒錯
- Wrong number. - Damn straight.
