1
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:43,735
Shit. Sorry, girl.

2
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:45,137
Final hole.

3
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:46,538
He birdies here,

4
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,841
he walks away
with the Green Jacket.

5
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:50,442
Fuck!

6
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,780
Wonderful.

7
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,600
You're late.

8
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:31,183
- The weapons?
- It's on the boat. The cash?

9
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:37,256
- Feels a little light.
- That's 45,000 now.

10
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:39,424
The rest you'll get wired
into an account of your choosing

11
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,326
- once we get the weapons.
- No, no, no!

12
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,662
This is bullshit!
This is not what we agreed on!

13
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,331
Hey, Pablo, Paco, Pepe,
whatever the fuck your name is.

14
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,633
Leave the weapons on the boat.

15
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,174
Okay. Fine.

16
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:57,643
You want to play games?
I'll play games.

17
00:02:57,645 --> 00:03:00,212
But I'll have you know,
I hate games.

18
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:02,948
In fact, I quit grade school because
of motherfucking recess!

19
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,652
We agreed on a set price.
I get the weapons, I drop them off here.

20
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:09,521
You pay me 150,000 cash
for my troubles.

21
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:13,859
- 150,000 cash.
- 45,000 cash.

22
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:16,328
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

23
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,665
I didn't realize this is<i> Let's Make a Deal.</i>
Okay, Monty.

24
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:24,870
Forty-give grand
for $45,000 worth of weapons.

25
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,575
Hey, hey, come on. Come on.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

26
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:31,276
Wait!

27
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:38,584
Ryan, get the bags,
get the weapons.

28
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:47,426
Not cool,<i> hombre.</i>

29
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:58,337
I can do this
all day,<i> amigo.</i>

30
00:03:58,339 --> 00:03:59,805
Fuck!

31
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,674
- Oh, shit.
- Blanks.

32
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,977
Logan. Logan. Logan.

33
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:07,379
Logan!

34
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:09,681
Logan. Logan!

35
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:11,650
Logan!

36
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,708
Well, this is a sad commentary
on today's society.

37
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,045
<i>Don't take it too personal, Jack.</i>

38
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:43,315
Don't kid yourself, partner.
It's always personal.

39
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:45,484
PS, where the fuck
were you on those last two?

40
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:49,288
Marksmanship 101, boss.
Gun-target line was shit.

41
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,757
I'm firing .308 win mags.

42
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,726
Oh, by the way,
you got some brain in your hair.

43
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:58,697
- Jesus Christ!
<i>- At this range, a .308 woulda ripped right through</i>

44
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:03,302
your recently deceased business partners
and left you with a sucking chest wound.

45
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:06,438
Well, good to know. All right,
let's get the hell out of here.

46
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,373
On my way, boss man.

47
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:19,618
What happened
with Gabriel's rounds?

48
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,653
I couldn't get
to his spare mags.

49
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,690
- He would have noticed!
- That could have been bad.

50
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:28,060
- Could have.
- You guys are fucking idiots, by the way.

51
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:31,797
How many more times you think you're
going to get away with this blanks shit?

52
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,799
Is that concern
I hear in your voice?

53
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:36,368
Yeah, concern
for my future employment.

54
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,806
My skill set doesn't exactly
translate to working at Starbucks.

55
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:43,709
Let's get out of here.

56
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:45,110
I'll see you
in a couple of weeks.

57
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,678
If you're lucky.

58
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,648
Come on, let's see what you got.
Come on. There you go.

59
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,517
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't push me too hard.

60
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,742
Can you grab me a towel?

61
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,823
What the fuck is this?

62
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:21,259
- What the fuck is what?
- This!

63
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,331
- Where'd you find that?
- Jenna would be pissed.

64
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:31,202
- Jenna and me have only...
- Jenna and I. I'm just saying.

65
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:35,006
Jenna and I have only
been dating for a few weeks.

66
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:39,110
- I'm throwing this out.
- Fine. I don't care. Throw it out.

67
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:50,155
Wow. I'm impressed.

68
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:52,924
When's the last time
you heard from her, anyway?

69
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,627
I don't know.

70
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,899
Six months.

71
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:23,622
You're a real nutless wonder,
you know that, Jack?

72
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,259
Honestly. What the hell
did you ever see in her?

73
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:33,665
Everybody down!

74
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:38,203
Get that. Let's go!

75
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:42,807
- Hello, Edward.
- <i>So glad you picked up.</i>

76
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,676
I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now,

77
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:46,378
<i>so I'll probably
just call you back.</i>

78
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,780
I know where you are
and I know what you are doing.

79
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,115
<i>Or did you forget who planned</i>

80
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,083
<i>this little trip
in the first place?</i>

81
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,985
You called this job off, Eddie.

82
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,087
So you can't blame me
for going ahead with this.

83
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,923
But I do blame you. You're
doing a job that I planned.

84
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:02,060
A job that I set up.
There are finder's fees associated with it.

85
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:05,030
Your job you called off and I
decided to move forward with?

86
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:09,100
Without me.
Without my permission, Karen.

87
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,236
What do you want, Eddie?

88
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:12,971
- My full share.
- <i>Which is?</i>

89
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:16,107
- One hundred percent.
- What happened to 60?

90
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:19,844
Well, the additional 40 is for the
indignity that I have suffered.

91
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,714
No fucking way.

92
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:26,151
<i>Yes fucking way, Karen.</i>

93
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,119
You called the cops?

94
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,021
What can I say?
My feelings were hurt.

95
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,123
<i>- You'll get nothing.
- A price I would gladly pay</i>

96
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,859
to teach you
a long overdue lesson.

97
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:47,038
Now, Glenn,

98
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,041
why is it that these ties look
like they were dipped in shit?

99
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:54,913
- Shit, Mr. Filosa?
- Shit. Yes.

100
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:57,082
Sir, you asked
for Scarlet Forest,

101
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:59,017
and I assure you these ties
are all Scarlet Forest.

102
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,119
- You're assuring me that?
- Yes, sir.

103
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:05,023
I'm assuring you that they look
like they were dipped in shit.

104
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,862
See this?

105
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:15,900
See this color? When that dries, that's
the color I want on these ties.

106
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:19,104
- Yes, sir.
- Off you go.

107
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:29,080
If Karen makes it out alive, she'll have
no choice but to take her original flight.

108
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,483
I need to know
exactly what she knows.

109
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:33,785
Yes, sir.

110
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,224
It's only a matter
of days now.

111
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:43,394
This job,
my job is right out there.

112
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:46,865
We can't let Karen fuck it up.

113
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:57,408
- Absolutely fucking not.
- Why not?

114
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:02,213
Why? 'Cause the fact that you borrow my dog in
order to trick your veterinarian girlfriend

115
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,249
to thinking you're
an animal lover is pathetic.

116
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:07,552
I am an animal lover,
I'm just not an animal owner.

117
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:11,122
- Do you even like this woman?
- Yes, I like this woman. I like her a lot.

118
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,825
Then why do you continue
to lie to her?

119
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:16,161
I lie to her
because I like her!

120
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:19,264
Ha. Well,
spoken like a true man.

121
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,067
Stop it.

122
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:29,808
I want her home by morning.

123
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:40,118
Reception. Yeah, he's right here.
All right, I'll let him know.

124
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,587
She's ready for you. Dr. Connor's
in the back with a sea lion, okay?

125
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:46,424
- Let's go. Come on.
- Oh. And daisies are her favorites.

126
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:51,129
- You know, for next time.
- Now you tell me.

127
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,968
Good job.

128
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,304
Come on.

129
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:07,212
She's doing much
better today, Kerry.

130
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,916
I have another patient
for you, doc.

131
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:16,187
Hi, Grace! Hi!

132
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,456
- I think she remembers you.
- I think so.

133
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,326
- Are those for me?
- Yes.

134
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:23,261
- I love roses.
- Yeah.

135
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:26,531
- How was the conference?
- I knocked them dead.

136
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,867
Of course.
I knew you would.

137
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:31,135
- How about dinner tonight?
- Hmm... two conditions.

138
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:32,303
- Name them.
- You cook.

139
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,639
- Done.
- And Grace is there.

140
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,307
Of course.
Grace will always be there.

141
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,276
- Hi, baby. Hi!
- Who's that, Grace?

142
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:50,655
One of my men just called.
They spotted her arriving at the airport.

143
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:53,191
- They're following her now.
- She can't do it alone.

144
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:56,094
- Find them.
- Yes, sir.

145
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,214
<i>♪ Every time I see your face ♪</i>

146
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:48,279
Grace! Grace, shut up!

147
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:03,528
Mm, Jack...

148
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,301
Jesus! Fuck!

149
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,970
Hi.

150
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:14,005
What the fuck
are you doing here?

151
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,975
Good to see you too, Jack.

152
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,278
Are you pregnant?

153
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,549
I'm going to go eat your leftovers
'cause they look delicious.

154
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:27,251
And I'll let you two
finish up here.

155
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:32,724
Use a condom.
That's all I'm going to say.

156
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:36,661
Jack, who is that woman?

157
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:48,473
- Yeah.
<i>- I found them, sir.</i>

158
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:50,141
- Good.
- <i>They'll be dead by morning.</i>

159
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,543
- Finish it.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

160
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:22,040
- How many months?
- Got any pickles?

161
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:26,310
- Karen...
- It's yours.

162
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:31,783
I know. I was in denial too
for a little while.

163
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:34,318
It's the first
of five stages of grief.

164
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,187
- Then there is...
- Where the fuck have you been?!

165
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:38,523
Then there's anger.

166
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:41,392
- I'm going to go.
- Oh! Jenna... Jenna.

167
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:45,096
Jenna, please, I'm so sorry
about this, you know... I...

168
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:47,799
Grace! Please!

169
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:49,400
- Do you want to call me later?
- Yes, of course.

170
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,336
Gimme a second.
Grace. Grace, knock it off!

171
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:54,739
I'm sorry. Just give me
one second, I'll walk you...

172
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:58,409
Grace! Come on, girl. Shut up!

173
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,083
Oh, shit!

174
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:09,720
Jenna, I need you
to listen to me.

175
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,689
Something very dangerous
is about to happen.

176
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:14,759
You can not ask any questions.
Do you understand me?

177
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,494
- What?
- That was a question!

178
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:45,756
Guns? You have guns?

179
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:48,326
Jack, is that a grenade?

180
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,698
What? Jack!

181
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,702
- You and me are going to talk.
- Now?

182
00:18:57,704 --> 00:19:00,538
- Get to the boat.
- Let's go.

183
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:31,636
Move! Move! Move!

184
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,173
Let's go! Come on,
Jenna, get in the boat!

185
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:41,679
Come on, girl! Let's go!

186
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:46,450
- Karen, get down!
- The dock!

187
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,654
Move, move, move!

188
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:57,528
Get on the boat!

189
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:29,527
- Jack!
- Give me a minute, Karen.

190
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,495
- Yeah, but I...
- Did you see the finger?!

191
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:33,397
- Yes, Jack, I see the finger!
- Well, the finger means

192
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:37,301
- I need one minute to think!
- Here they come!

193
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:43,241
What are you doing?

194
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,610
- I'm calling the police!
- Give me that!

195
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:47,612
There's no calling the police!

196
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,885
Ah!

197
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:03,461
- Where are we going, Jack?
- Somewhere safe, Jenna.

198
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:08,833
- Okay, Karen, go.
- Someone thinks I stole from him.

199
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:11,435
- Did you? Karen!
- What?!

200
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,272
- Did you steal from someone?
- No!

201
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:17,775
Jesus Christ! Do you ever
think anything through?!

202
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:21,746
Oh, don't talk to me about thinking things
through! You over analyze everything!

203
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:25,049
I like to plan! I like to plan so I don't
get into shit like this!

204
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:29,720
Please just pay attention to
the people trying to kill us!

205
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:31,022
Faster! Faster! Let's go!

206
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:36,060
- I ran a job for Eddie Filosa.
- Oh, mistake number one.

207
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:38,329
- You know him?
- I know of him.

208
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,767
Well, the job went south
and we lost the score.

209
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:44,468
Well, that happens.

210
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:49,874
Yeah, well, tell that to Eddie.
He wants me to make good for it!

211
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:53,778
- All of it?
- All of it!

212
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,884
- How big?
- Huge!

213
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:03,721
- That's not very rational.
- Eddie's not exactly rational, Jack.

214
00:22:08,895 --> 00:22:11,729
- Is she okay?
- She's fine.

215
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:16,067
- What is Logan's dog even doing here?
- Grace is Logan's dog?

216
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:18,936
- She didn't know?
- I was going to tell you.

217
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:21,505
You were going to tell me what part, Jack?

218
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,542
That Grace isn't yours,
that you got an ex-girlfriend pregnant,

219
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:26,811
or that you're some type
of uber-criminal?!

220
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:29,447
She's got a point, Jack.

221
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:35,086
Come on, faster! Go!

222
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:43,828
Can you take out that Jet Ski?

223
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,731
I'm out! Of course
I can take out the Jet Ski!

224
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,972
There's something wrong
with your gun!

225
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:56,707
There's nothing wrong
with my gun, Karen.

226
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,376
Oh, really?

227
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,411
Then why don't we let "this
year's model" give it a try?

228
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:04,148
- Just leave her alone.
- Why? I know she likes to just lay on her back,

229
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,950
but maybe she wants
to participate more.

230
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:08,686
What the hell did you ever see
in this woman, Jack?

231
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:11,756
I gave him a reason
to fuck with the lights on!

232
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:23,501
- Jack!
- What?

233
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:24,902
There are
no more Jet Skis.

234
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,971
The bad news, no more guns.

235
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:30,074
- What do we got left?
- A shotgun.

236
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,145
We're never going to hit them
from this distance.

237
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:36,914
- I'm going to flatspin the boat.
- Really?

238
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:40,618
Just like Brazil.

239
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:06,710
Ah!

240
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,764
Karen! Take the wheel!

241
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:28,966
- Get her out of here!
- Go!

242
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:35,039
Jack, what are you doing? Jack!

243
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:01,131
Fucking bitch!

244
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:23,888
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, God!

245
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,600
Mm!

246
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:42,740
Fuck!

247
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:48,913
Grace, get over here,
girl. Come on!

248
00:25:56,689 --> 00:26:00,624
Are you all right?

249
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,235
- Jenna, can I talk to you for a minute, please?
- Yeah.

250
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:16,974
I need you to get a hotel
for the next few days.

251
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:19,076
Call in sick to work.
Don't tell them where you are.

252
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:21,045
I don't want to get a hotel.
I want to go home.

253
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:23,047
I understand you're
a bit overwhelmed right now,

254
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:24,915
but I've been through these
things in the past, a few times.

255
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,685
You're just going
to have to trust me.

256
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:31,989
- Are you coming with me?
- Not right now, but I'll come back to check on you.

257
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:34,024
Are you going somewhere
with her?

258
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:36,927
Yeah. Unfortunately.

259
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,630
I need to figure out what's
going on. I need some answers.

260
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:41,365
I'm not going to get those
with you around.

261
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:43,734
- Are you going to waterboard her?
- No.

262
00:26:43,736 --> 00:26:45,970
I'm not going
to waterboard her, I just...

263
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:48,005
I just don't want you to get more
involved than you already are.

264
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:50,307
I think you should
waterboard her.

265
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:55,045
Okay. I'm sorry...
about all this.

266
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:59,049
- Me too.
- Logan'll be by in the morning to pick up Grace.

267
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:00,884
Okay.

268
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:25,009
The saddest part, Grace,
I've had worse dates.

269
00:27:34,687 --> 00:27:37,321
Anyone seen the boss? Hey!

270
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,690
Anyone seen the boss?

271
00:27:39,692 --> 00:27:42,059
Like really...

272
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:44,328
What the fuck? You bitches.

273
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:48,399
What the fuck?
What's your problem, psycho?

274
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:50,100
You. Dick breath.

275
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:52,670
Hey! You can't talk
to us like that.

276
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:54,304
Yes, I can.

277
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:57,274
What's the matter with you?
What the fuck are you doing, girls?

278
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:59,977
Let me ask you a question.
How do you invest your money?

279
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:02,446
- What?
- Invest.

280
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:05,449
Eddie pays you, right?
What do you do with your money?

281
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:08,819
- I buy shit.
- You buy shit like what?

282
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:11,021
- Shoes.
- Shoes. And?

283
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,090
- Nice shoes.
- Great. What else?

284
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:16,360
- These boobs.
- They're nice boobs, by the way.

285
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:19,296
What's your point, tough guy?
We don't have all day.

286
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:23,867
My point is you got about
two, maybe three more years

287
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:27,304
of whoring yourself out before
a whole new batch of younger

288
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:30,708
and prettier whores comes rolling
in through that front door.

289
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,376
And all you're going
to have to show for it

290
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:36,046
is a closet full of old shoes,
and a banged up pussy.

291
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:40,818
Now, if I had a vagina,
and I had your ass,

292
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,088
and your fucking tits,
I'd be a fucking millionaire.

293
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:47,991
Instead, the good Lord blessed me with
a big dick and moral flexibility.

294
00:28:47,993 --> 00:28:52,062
So... I'm going
to ask you one more time,

295
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:55,733
or I swear to God I'm going
to bitch-slap you so hard,

296
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:59,369
your brand-new tits are going
to pop out of your ass. Understood?

297
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:03,173
- Where's Eddie?
- The cabana.

298
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:05,242
You girls have a good day.

299
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:11,415
We've known each other
a long time.

300
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:15,219
You've never been one for foreplay, so why
don't you just spare me the bullshit.

301
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:18,856
Tell me what you need.

302
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:24,194
- There's a job.
- I knew it.

303
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:27,431
- Just hear me out, Jack.
- If I remember correctly,

304
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:31,201
the last time I helped you out, Karen,
I almost ended up on the wrong side of the grass.

305
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,337
If I remember correctly,
you weren't exactly putting up a fight.

306
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:35,439
Forget it, Karen.

307
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:39,243
I'm in trouble, Jack.
Real trouble.

308
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:42,279
- I wouldn't be here unless I needed...
- Someone.

309
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,916
...you.
Unless I needed you.

310
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:50,554
I lost my entire crew, Jack.
I barely got out alive.

311
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:53,824
And I lost the score. Eddie's going
to kill me unless I pay him back.

312
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:57,161
This job? It's big money,
small risk.

313
00:29:57,163 --> 00:30:02,232
If we pull it off, it's enough
money to pay back Eddie and...

314
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:05,002
...and then some.

315
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:18,348
What's the job?

316
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:24,154
I like chess. It's a perfect
metaphor for life.

317
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:28,125
Every piece is bound
to its nature, just like people.

318
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:31,094
- What do you think, Simon?
- I don't play.

319
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:34,164
You really should.
What about you, Bob?

320
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:37,201
- I'm more of a poker guy.
- Yeah, I like poker.

321
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:40,270
Also a great game. All about trying to make
the most of what you got...

322
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:44,041
Yeah, sure, Mr. F. Listen, could
you tell me what I'm doing here?

323
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:46,977
Bear with me.
This will just take a second.

324
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:50,013
I want you to put your hand on this Bible.
I have something to ask you

325
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,015
and I want you to be
perfectly honest with me.

326
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:55,519
- Don't know why...
- Indulge me.

327
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:05,329
I appreciate poker.
It's a game of hope. A game of dreams.

328
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:09,633
A game of lies.
But chess, it's a game of order.

329
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:13,971
This pawn can
only move one way.

330
00:31:13,973 --> 00:31:18,375
Move forward,
can only take diagonally.

331
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:23,213
And if it works really hard,
it can become something better,

332
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:28,252
something more.
Like you. You're a pawn, Rob.

333
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:32,222
And what pawns do not do
is tell secrets to the enemy queen

334
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:35,359
- in hopes that she'll fuck him.
- Mr. F, I never said a word!

335
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:38,996
What are you doing?!
No! No! God! Fuck! God!

336
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:41,331
So many nerves
in the hand.

337
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:44,334
God! Fuck! God! I said nothing!

338
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:48,071
We're not playing poker now,
Robert. We're playing chess.

339
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:51,375
I am the king,
Simon is my knight.

340
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:53,377
Leave it.

341
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:57,047
You are a pawn,
and if you aren't careful,

342
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:59,216
you are going to be sacrificed.
Do you understand that?

343
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:02,252
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Now, Robert,

344
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:06,657
what exactly did you tell Karen regarding
my latest business ventures?

345
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:10,227
- I told her about the Eastern Federal job.
- Yes.

346
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:14,331
- I told her about the Cayman Islands job.
- Yes.

347
00:32:16,235 --> 00:32:19,336
I told her about
the armored car.

348
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:22,072
- The armored car.
- Yeah. Yes, sir.

349
00:32:22,074 --> 00:32:26,276
- That means...
- That means she knows everything.

350
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,615
What are we going
to do with Robert?

351
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,586
You're going to kill me.

352
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:40,223
Eventually, yeah.

353
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:42,326
Eventually.

354
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:51,401
- Armored car?
- Yeah. More or less.

355
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:57,274
- It's a stupid sport.
- It was a nice shot.

356
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:59,376
- Don't be a dick.
- Here.

357
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:06,249
So what do you think?

358
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:11,254
I think you've definitely secured yourself
a spot on<i> The Jerry Springer Show.</i>

359
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:15,258
- I mean about the job.
- I know what you mean, Jack.

360
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:18,996
Nothing,
and I mean nothing good,

361
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:21,298
can come from working
with her, man.

362
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,334
- What about the baby?
- Are you sure it's even yours?

363
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:28,438
She's been gone, man, shacking
up with only God knows what.

364
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,576
- Hey, hey.
- Sorry.

365
00:33:32,578 --> 00:33:36,346
I just keep
hoping she's changed.

366
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:42,019
And after the last job that she had that
went bad and now the baby, I just...

367
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:46,323
Maybe she'll finally want something
different, something... something else.

368
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:50,527
- Just say it.
- Me.

369
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:55,032
Yeah. Maybe she'll
finally want me.

370
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:58,468
Grace! Come here, girl.

371
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,171
Come on. Come here.

372
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:05,509
Be a poodle, Grace. Come on, be a
little dumb-ass yippie poodle.

373
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:07,244
- Come on.
- What're you doing?

374
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:09,379
- Proving a point.
- Yeah?

375
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,481
- Which is?
- That I have a better chance

376
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:14,351
of Grace turning
into some dumb-ass poodle

377
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:18,355
than you do of getting this
cold-hearted, manipulative bitch

378
00:34:18,357 --> 00:34:21,191
to settle down
and live a normal life.

379
00:34:21,193 --> 00:34:23,693
Oh, you think this kid
is going to change who she is?

380
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:27,097
You think this kid is going
to make her love you?

381
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:29,166
Wake the fuck up, my friend.

382
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:33,270
She's always going to be Karen.
Now she's just Karen with a kid.

383
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:38,508
Yeah.

384
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:41,411
You know why
I keep that picture?

385
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:44,648
There was a time when we used to
talk about moving to St. John,

386
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,684
or some other tropical island,
opening up a dive shop,

387
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:50,854
living the rest
of our lives in paradise.

388
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:52,556
Some real
Hemingway-type shit.

389
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:54,658
And that picture
was a reminder of why I do...

390
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,760
why we keep doing
what we're doing.

391
00:34:56,762 --> 00:35:01,665
You're just taking these risks,
and making easy money the hard way, but...

392
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:05,368
I can't keep
doing this shit forever.

393
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,671
So if there's even the
slightest chance that I can make

394
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:11,641
that stupid fucking pipe dream
a reality, I'm going for it.

395
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:17,114
You don't owe me anything,
Logan.

396
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,350
Don't say that.

397
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,487
Don't you fucking say that.

398
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:26,857
We're friends, right?
Practically fucking family?

399
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:30,560
- Yeah.
- Then it's not about owing me.

400
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:34,431
It was never about that.
It's what friends do, it's what family does.

401
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:36,633
We... we back
each other's plays,

402
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:39,469
even when we absolutely know
they're fucked from the get go.

403
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:44,574
- Right?
- Yeah, I guess so.

404
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:49,579
Mm... No. No "I guess so."
That's the way it is.

405
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:52,482
- So?
- So?

406
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:55,452
Let's do this.

407
00:35:55,454 --> 00:35:57,721
Why are you so grumpy?

408
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:13,436
- Is that the truck?
- That's the truck. 30 million in gems.

409
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:14,471
That's the route.

410
00:36:14,473 --> 00:36:17,207
- Two days?
- Two days.

411
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:24,281
- We're going to need a second gunman.
- Definitely.

412
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:27,284
- We're going to need a driver.
- I know where to find one.

413
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:31,655
- A damn good driver.
- I know where to find one.

414
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,544
Drew.

415
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,714
Andrew.

416
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:00,250
Andrew Herzberg!

417
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:11,328
Jack? Jack! Really?
I can't believe what I'm seeing!

418
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,829
- It's been a long time, brother.
- This guy?

419
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:15,232
This guy flew in the 160th?

420
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:16,900
Right up until breaking
his commander's jaw.

421
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:21,972
Sh... Night stalkers don't...

422
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,880
That was completely necessary.

423
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:33,583
I feel a hundred percent.

424
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:39,356
- What brings you to Thailand?
- We're in Mississippi.

425
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:40,890
Really?

426
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:43,893
No fucking way.

427
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:46,429
Can we get
a napkin or something?

428
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,732
- Right there.
- Herzberg!

429
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:52,602
There you are.
You piece of shit!

430
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,671
- You pissed the bed again!
- What?

431
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:56,840
Yeah. You pissed the bed!

432
00:37:56,842 --> 00:38:00,277
Honey, I know I'm really big,
but, you know, it still hurts.

433
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:03,913
Smell it. Smell it!
Smell your filthy piss!

434
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:07,717
- All right. Well, it is me. Definitely.
- Oh, yeah.

435
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:11,421
Mm! It smells like whiskey,
and failure,

436
00:38:11,423 --> 00:38:15,692
and sadness, and everything
else bad in the world!

437
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:20,430
- This guy's a mess.
- He's doing much better than the last time I saw him.

438
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:22,332
Don't ask.

439
00:38:27,406 --> 00:38:29,806
So, what are you thinking, Drew?

440
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:33,076
I think this baby is capable
of what you're asking for.

441
00:38:33,078 --> 00:38:36,780
I'll just need to make a few modifications,
but you know me, man.

442
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:39,716
- I can drive, fly, or fuck...
- You think, or you know?

443
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:43,420
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, there's a big difference.

444
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:45,588
You may think you're
one hell of a driver,

445
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,790
but I know you're
a drunk asshole.

446
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:49,092
How could she possibly
already know

447
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:51,728
- that I'm an asshole?
- What's the problem?

448
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:55,532
Our plan lies strictly on whether
or not this drunk asshole can drive.

449
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:59,669
- That doesn't concern you?
- Again with the unsubstantiated asshole claim.

450
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,771
No. It doesn't concern me.

451
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:04,641
- Because I've seen him drive.
- And I've seen him drunk.

452
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:07,811
I never drive drunk.
Buzzed, maybe.

453
00:39:07,813 --> 00:39:11,981
Hung-over, absolutely.
But drunk, never.

454
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:16,353
Oh, that's a relief, coming from the
guy whose breath still smells like puke.

455
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:18,788
I'll be in the car.

456
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:22,726
- She's nice.
- This is a good day.

457
00:39:37,743 --> 00:39:42,846
You've any idea how sexy you are
when you do your tough guy routine?

458
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:45,982
- Everything set?
- Yes, Jack. Everything's set.

459
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:50,887
I love how you worry
about every single detail

460
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,156
right up
until the last minute.

461
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:55,492
- Karen...
- Mm-hm?

462
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:57,060
Stop.

463
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:01,765
I can't.

464
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:04,567
- Because of Ms. Milquetoast?
- She's not milquetoast.

465
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:07,771
Come on, Jack. That girl
is Madame Vanilla. Boring.

466
00:40:07,773 --> 00:40:10,874
It's not about Madame Vanilla.

467
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:14,711
It's not about Jenna,
it's about...

468
00:40:14,713 --> 00:40:17,514
- It's about us, it's you.
- Mm-hm.

469
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:22,719
And what I want, what you want and
how that is... completely different.

470
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:26,623
I don't think that what we
want is that much different.

471
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:47,744
You don't have
a second gunman.

472
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:49,779
You know that
I'm more than capable.

473
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,615
Absolutely not.

474
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,651
- It's my job.
- No.

475
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:55,919
I should be on that truck.

476
00:40:55,921 --> 00:40:58,755
If you're on this job,
I walk, I'm gone.

477
00:40:58,757 --> 00:41:00,523
Then who?

478
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:03,726
Andrew has a guy.

479
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:06,596
- Oh, and you trust him?
- Yeah. I trust Andrew.

480
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:07,831
Fine!

481
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:18,775
Thirty million
in gems on this truck?

482
00:41:18,777 --> 00:41:21,744
That's right,
30 million in gems.

483
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:25,982
- We'll get 20 on the market.
- Maybe more.

484
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,785
Let's just count on 20.

485
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:30,086
You owe Eddie eight.

486
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:34,991
That leaves roughly 12
for the five of us.

487
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,863
That's correct.

488
00:41:42,601 --> 00:41:44,834
And then what?

489
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:55,144
Well, then a house
in St. John.

490
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:03,720
Who is it?
Our second gunman?

491
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:07,790
Nicholas Sepher. Andrew knows
him from his time in the Army.

492
00:42:17,836 --> 00:42:20,837
Don't you fucking do it, woman.
Don't you do it!

493
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:22,272
Maybe you should have not
texted your ex-wife.

494
00:42:22,274 --> 00:42:24,841
Her mother died!
Do not fucking do it!

495
00:42:24,843 --> 00:42:27,877
- You can die in hell.
- Oh, hell would be fucking paradise

496
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:31,648
compared to being
married to you!

497
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,016
Andrew told me
about the job.

498
00:42:33,018 --> 00:42:34,984
We're not done with our talk.

499
00:42:34,986 --> 00:42:37,287
I'm in, man.

500
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:39,923
Yeah, you're in, all right,
for a whole new world of hurt.

501
00:42:39,925 --> 00:42:41,891
- You haven't heard the details.
- I don't need to. I don't care,

502
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:43,293
as long as it involves Herzberg,
it's going to get me

503
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:44,994
the fuck outta
this house for a while.

504
00:42:44,996 --> 00:42:47,030
And what the hell's
so wrong with our house?

505
00:42:47,032 --> 00:42:48,665
- This thing fairly dangerous?
- Sure.

506
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:49,966
- It's Jack, right?
- Yeah.

507
00:42:49,968 --> 00:42:51,901
Well, Jack, I miss my life.

508
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:55,738
I miss getting fucked by a real
man. We all make sacrifices.

509
00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:01,711
I will choke a bitch.
Can you shut the fuck up?!

510
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:04,047
I hope you get shot.

511
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:06,883
Look in my eyes, Jack.
Do I look happy to you?

512
00:43:06,885 --> 00:43:10,887
- I hope you get dick shot.
- It's this. Every day.

513
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:12,956
The worst kind of shot.

514
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,860
- You married, Jack? You got kids?
- Ish.

515
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:21,230
- Yeah. Well, it sucks, man.
- Nicholas.

516
00:43:21,232 --> 00:43:24,067
Because everybody's
happy except me. Me?

517
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:26,102
- Nicholas!
- Oh, man, I'm just looking for a reason

518
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:28,371
to put a gun back in my hand,
and a bullet in someone else's brain

519
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:30,707
before I put one in my own.
So tell me,

520
00:43:30,709 --> 00:43:32,609
are the guys we're going up
against, are they bad?

521
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:34,978
- Faceless corporation.
- That's even better.

522
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,946
- Nicholas!
- What?!

523
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:39,782
- I'm going to give you crabs.
- That's it. Pack your shit.

524
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:42,785
Take those fucking rat dogs
and get out of my house!

525
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,821
One of those dogs
is yours, cocksucker.

526
00:43:44,823 --> 00:43:48,091
Do I look like I wanted
a fucking Labradoodle?!

527
00:43:48,093 --> 00:43:52,362
She's our baby. I'm going
to piss on your laptop.

528
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:54,964
She will. Excuse me.

529
00:43:57,669 --> 00:43:59,636
He'll do.

530
00:44:02,107 --> 00:44:03,940
Guard in the front.
Guard in the back.

531
00:44:03,942 --> 00:44:05,775
Anyone who tries
to drive this thing

532
00:44:05,777 --> 00:44:07,243
other than the driver
assigned for that day,

533
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:10,079
biometric system automatically
kills the engine.

534
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:13,082
Can't be restarted. Okay?
We got 20 minutes or less.

535
00:44:13,084 --> 00:44:16,986
State-of-the-art vault. Once it's locked,
only gets open from the inside.

536
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:21,024
It takes us about an hour,
an hour to cut through.

537
00:44:21,026 --> 00:44:22,659
- How am I doing so far, Karen?
- Mm...

538
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:25,962
Let's run through this. Nick.

539
00:44:25,964 --> 00:44:29,098
I stop the truck.

540
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:32,068
- I take out the guard.
- The glass is bulletproof.

541
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,970
Well, it's a good thing
I ain't using bullets.

542
00:44:33,972 --> 00:44:36,973
- What're you using?
- Spark plugs.

543
00:44:36,975 --> 00:44:39,976
These babies will break bulletproof
glass like my wife breaks my balls.

544
00:44:39,978 --> 00:44:43,246
- Logan.
- Provide overwatch.

545
00:44:43,248 --> 00:44:46,983
- Andrew.
- So at 0900 I pick you up,

546
00:44:46,985 --> 00:44:48,918
I drive the tow truck.

547
00:44:51,256 --> 00:44:54,891
- You forgot the armored car.
- Right. I'll get it next time.

548
00:44:54,893 --> 00:44:57,894
- Asshole.
- And Karen.

549
00:44:57,896 --> 00:45:01,864
Oh, I stay here.
Because I'm fat and pregnant.

550
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:05,001
- You know, I was...
- She's fat and pregnant.

551
00:45:05,003 --> 00:45:07,470
Just the way I like them.

552
00:45:07,472 --> 00:45:10,373
I still don't know how you plan on
breaking into the truck's vault.

553
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:13,209
Because it's a surprise.

554
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,311
- Oh.
- I love surprises.

555
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:18,247
Mm-hm. We all like
surprises, right, guys?

556
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:26,456
- Logan?
- Yeah. Look, I don't like you, I don't fucking trust you.

557
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:30,059
You be where you're supposed to be tomorrow.
Car fueled up, ready to go.

558
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:33,463
- I'll be there.
- That's good to hear. Because if you're not,

559
00:45:33,465 --> 00:45:36,733
I'll find you, wait for
that fucking kid to be born,

560
00:45:36,735 --> 00:45:40,303
and give you a Colombian necktie as
a belated baby shower present.

561
00:45:40,305 --> 00:45:44,841
Graphic, but it gets your point across.
Are we done?

562
00:45:44,843 --> 00:45:46,476
No, we're not fucking done.

563
00:45:46,478 --> 00:45:48,478
He's got a great thing
going with Jenna.

564
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,079
He doesn't need you
fucking it up.

565
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:51,881
You don't think
that he should be

566
00:45:51,883 --> 00:45:53,850
with someone like that
any more than he does.

567
00:45:53,852 --> 00:45:56,052
Let me rephrase.
You fuck this up,

568
00:45:56,054 --> 00:45:58,788
you fuck over Jack,
and I'll kill you.

569
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:01,157
Now you're just being redundant.

570
00:46:41,065 --> 00:46:45,201
Get on there, my little friend.
Yeah. Like old times.

571
00:46:51,176 --> 00:46:53,442
Look alive, people. Showtime.

572
00:46:53,444 --> 00:46:57,847
- You ready, Nick?
- Let's rock and roll.

573
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:18,367
What's going on?

574
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:22,471
Fuck!

575
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:28,344
Hey, buddy!
You might want to duck!

576
00:47:44,262 --> 00:47:47,163
- I'm going to the next location.
- Copy that.

577
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:58,541
Jack, we got a problem.

578
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:01,510
- How soon?
- Check your six, boss.

579
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:12,188
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. Let's go.
Come back. Back. Hold! Right there.

580
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:28,471
Get ready.

581
00:48:28,473 --> 00:48:30,206
All right, Drew.
We gotta bounce.

582
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:31,407
Let's go!

583
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,917
Let's go.

584
00:48:55,233 --> 00:48:58,034
Jack, you got three vehicles
headed your way.

585
00:48:58,036 --> 00:49:00,937
And seven...

586
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:02,505
Six bad guys.

587
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:22,258
- We got three on us.
- Welcome to the suck.

588
00:49:26,531 --> 00:49:28,331
Left! Go left!

589
00:49:30,335 --> 00:49:32,969
- We got one on the right.
- I got him.

590
00:49:53,024 --> 00:49:55,424
Shit! Why do the bad guys always
have automatic weapons?

591
00:49:55,426 --> 00:49:58,227
I don't know,
but I'm getting hard!

592
00:50:10,308 --> 00:50:12,141
- You got him?
- One down. Two to go.

593
00:50:12,143 --> 00:50:13,376
There you go, Jackie boy!

594
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:26,756
Shit!

595
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:35,364
You got him, Jackie boy!

596
00:50:44,442 --> 00:50:46,442
Get me closer.

597
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:11,500
- Closer!
- Where are they? I can't see them.

598
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:12,735
All right. Drive.

599
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:21,177
Shit, I don't see them!

600
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:23,479
Go! Go!
On the left! On the left!

601
00:51:24,382 --> 00:51:26,816
Whoa!

602
00:51:32,523 --> 00:51:33,556
There. Right there!

603
00:51:59,517 --> 00:52:02,351
Oh, God!

604
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:06,122
Ah! Fuck!

605
00:52:10,728 --> 00:52:12,328
Oh, shit! Brake!

606
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:26,408
- Oh! Yeah!
- Whoo!

607
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:28,444
That a boy!

608
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:40,256
Jackie boy!
We got about 15 minutes

609
00:52:40,258 --> 00:52:42,424
- before this place is swarming with cops.
- I just need two.

610
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:43,759
You want me
to get you a thermal lance?

611
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:46,195
I don't need to get in.

612
00:52:46,197 --> 00:52:47,796
I just need this guy
to want out.

613
00:52:55,206 --> 00:52:56,705
Stop it!

614
00:53:03,447 --> 00:53:06,815
Hands behind your back!
On your stomach! On your stomach!

615
00:53:06,817 --> 00:53:09,418
Hands behind your back! Down!

616
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,295
Holy dingle berries!

617
00:53:19,297 --> 00:53:21,530
- That's a lot of coin.
- Just like Karen said.

618
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:26,702
Yeah. Just like Karen said.

619
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:28,537
All right.
Let's get out of here.

620
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:45,788
- Come on, Jack. Let's rock and roll.
- Yeah.

621
00:54:44,415 --> 00:54:46,415
<i>Where you going, boss man?</i>

622
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:49,051
I just want to check something
out. It's probably nothing.

623
00:54:49,053 --> 00:54:52,354
Just keep going, I'll...
I'll catch up with you.

624
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:13,809
You were always a miracle worker
with your hands.

625
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:16,612
It would have taken me
at least five minutes. Hey!

626
00:55:16,614 --> 00:55:19,682
Just stop right there.

627
00:55:19,684 --> 00:55:22,451
- So, what happens now, Eddie?
- What happens now?

628
00:55:22,453 --> 00:55:24,787
You're going to give me that little
black box, that's what happens now.

629
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:28,724
- Then what?
- And then what? Then you get to live.

630
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:33,662
- Eddie!
- What?

631
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:35,698
Let her go.

632
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:40,536
Put the gun down, hero.

633
00:55:40,538 --> 00:55:42,771
Put the gun down and kick it
over here towards me.

634
00:55:42,773 --> 00:55:46,775
- Don't do it, Jack.
- Nobody asked you your opinion, so shut the fuck up!

635
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:49,912
Don't worry, hero. With you, she might have
liked it all sweet and gentle,

636
00:55:49,914 --> 00:55:52,681
but with me, she liked it
a little bit rougher.

637
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:55,818
Mm. Isn't that right,
sweetheart?

638
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:58,921
Kick it over here to me!

639
00:56:03,761 --> 00:56:07,963
What did you promise him. Huh?
What did you promised him?

640
00:56:07,965 --> 00:56:12,701
Money? Sex? What?

641
00:56:14,972 --> 00:56:18,006
No.

642
00:56:18,008 --> 00:56:23,145
He doesn't know? No.

643
00:56:23,147 --> 00:56:26,749
You bitch.

644
00:56:26,751 --> 00:56:30,753
Let me show you something.
Let me show you something.

645
00:56:33,391 --> 00:56:36,425
- Eddie. Eddie...
- This? Is that what you're talking about?

646
00:56:36,427 --> 00:56:38,660
Eddie, please, no.

647
00:56:39,597 --> 00:56:41,063
Eddie. Eddie!

648
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:42,131
Say bye-bye to the baby.

649
00:56:42,133 --> 00:56:43,465
Don't do it, Eddie.

650
00:56:44,402 --> 00:56:45,868
No!

651
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,739
Oh, no! No baby!

652
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:54,810
Oh, no. No one's hurt.

653
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:58,747
So you did make it out

654
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:00,816
of the Caymans with something.
Get over there.

655
00:57:00,818 --> 00:57:03,552
Guess she needed you
to screw me out of this.

656
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:07,823
<i>Jack, I'm in position,
but I can't get a clean shot.</i>

657
00:57:10,161 --> 00:57:12,694
- Three...
- Shame really.

658
00:57:12,696 --> 00:57:14,029
If things were different,

659
00:57:14,031 --> 00:57:16,098
we could have made
a lot of dough, you and me.

660
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:21,069
- <i>Two...</i>
- Well, it's a real shame, Jack.

661
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:24,640
One. On your go.

662
00:57:24,642 --> 00:57:26,775
Sometimes things
just don't work out.

663
00:57:28,913 --> 00:57:30,546
Down now!

664
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:38,754
- Jack!
- Let's go!

665
00:57:57,041 --> 00:57:58,674
Let's roll!

666
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:03,579
- Yeah, let's go!
<i>- Logan, let's go.</i>

667
00:58:29,807 --> 00:58:34,009
- Ah!
- Come on, Logan. Let's go.

668
00:59:01,272 --> 00:59:05,641
She's lost a lot of blood.
You guys should take her to a real hospital.

669
00:59:05,643 --> 00:59:07,743
We can't.

670
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,179
Jenna, I can't thank you enough.

671
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:14,249
Just be out
of here by Monday.

672
00:59:15,286 --> 00:59:18,720
And Jack,
don't ever call me again.

673
00:59:31,702 --> 00:59:34,903
I wouldn't want
to be Karen right about now.

674
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:36,772
Women.

675
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:43,579
Was it worth it?

676
00:59:44,715 --> 00:59:46,682
Hm?

677
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:53,255
I asked you a question.
Was it worth it?

678
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:56,692
- None of this was my plan, Jack.
- What was the plan, Karen?

679
00:59:56,694 --> 01:00:00,896
- Was I supposed to get killed?
- No. You were supposed to get 30 million.

680
01:00:00,898 --> 01:00:02,931
What about
the fake pregnancy?

681
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:06,101
- I had to make sure.
- For what? For what?!

682
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:09,605
For this? Hm? This?

683
01:00:09,607 --> 01:00:12,040
This little thing?
What is this?

684
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:14,676
- A key.
- To what?

685
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,379
God help me, Karen!

686
01:00:17,381 --> 01:00:20,182
You don't have the baby inside
to protect you.

687
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:22,918
A safe.

688
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:29,291
This is for another job?

689
01:00:33,263 --> 01:00:36,064
And how much is in this safe?

690
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:38,100
Hm? It has to be
a lot more than 30 million.

691
01:00:38,102 --> 01:00:39,401
We're talking 50? 75?

692
01:00:39,403 --> 01:00:42,037
- Half a billion.
- Oh, fuck! Bullshit.

693
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:43,672
Red diamonds.

694
01:00:43,674 --> 01:00:45,841
CIA Black Op.

695
01:00:45,843 --> 01:00:48,944
Five million a carat,
100 carats, 500 million.

696
01:00:48,946 --> 01:00:50,746
The plane with the safe
flies in tomorrow,

697
01:00:50,748 --> 01:00:53,148
just long enough to refuel,
and then it's gone.

698
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:56,118
Oh, I see. I see.
And what were you going to do?

699
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:58,420
Just walk in there
and take them?

700
01:00:58,422 --> 01:01:01,056
No one was supposed
to get hurt.

701
01:01:01,058 --> 01:01:03,659
Logan did.

702
01:01:03,661 --> 01:01:05,994
Yeah, I see,
not that you fucking care!

703
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:09,998
I just earmarked my entire team. We have a death
mark on us. Eddie's going to hunt us down.

704
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,835
- So thank you very much!
- I never meant for this to happen!

705
01:01:20,678 --> 01:01:23,378
What about that sonogram
I found in your purse?

706
01:01:25,883 --> 01:01:29,418
It was real.
But I lost the baby.

707
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:32,888
Was it mine?

708
01:01:45,903 --> 01:01:48,103
Go get your diamonds.
Have a nice life.

709
01:01:48,105 --> 01:01:52,441
With half a billion, you can afford
to stay the fuck out of mine.

710
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:32,314
Come on, Logan. I could really use that
"I told you so" look right about now.

711
01:02:51,969 --> 01:02:55,437
- I think you should kiss her on the forehead.
- What?

712
01:02:55,439 --> 01:03:00,208
I don't know. I mean, I feel like you
should kiss her or something, you know?

713
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:03,979
- Dude, have you...
- Make her feel like she's loved.

714
01:03:03,981 --> 01:03:05,914
She's not into
that sappy shit.

715
01:03:05,916 --> 01:03:09,918
Really? Jesus, she's sleeping.
I mean, what is she going to do?

716
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,254
She'll break your fucking face.
That's what she'll do.

717
01:03:12,256 --> 01:03:19,227
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Welcome back. How you feeling?

718
01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:21,296
Like I went dancing
with a claymore.

719
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:24,132
Oh, baby! Oh, baby!

720
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:28,136
- What are you doing here, babe?
- I'm sorry. Is it...?

721
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:31,273
No, no, baby. It's just my leg.
Mm! It's just my leg.

722
01:03:31,275 --> 01:03:33,475
Thank God!
I didn't mean what I said.

723
01:03:33,477 --> 01:03:35,277
I know.
I know you love my dick.

724
01:03:35,279 --> 01:03:38,413
- I'm sorry. It's...
- What did you bring me?

725
01:03:38,415 --> 01:03:42,250
Oh. Jack, this was
on the front doorstep for you.

726
01:03:42,252 --> 01:03:47,088
- What is it?
- Some kind of remote and a cell phone.

727
01:03:54,865 --> 01:03:58,867
<i>Jack.</i>

728
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:03,138
My new best friend jerk off.
You left in such a hurry.

729
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:04,973
What can I do for you, Eddie?

730
01:04:04,975 --> 01:04:07,609
Turns out Karen
isn't the cold-hearted bitch

731
01:04:07,611 --> 01:04:11,146
we made her out to be.
She stopped by my hotel

732
01:04:11,148 --> 01:04:13,982
<i>with what you now hold in your
hands. Tried to make amends.</i>

733
01:04:13,984 --> 01:04:16,184
<i>Tried to tell me
that it was all her fault,</i>

734
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:20,255
to leave you and your merry band
of misfit hoods out of this.

735
01:04:20,257 --> 01:04:25,126
- Here. Say hi, sweetheart.
- Just run, Jack.

736
01:04:25,128 --> 01:04:28,530
That's right, Jack. Run.
Run as fast as you can.

737
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:31,633
I probably won't use my
considerable resources to find you

738
01:04:31,635 --> 01:04:35,503
- <i>and put you down.</i>
- It's not the first time I've been threatened.

739
01:04:35,505 --> 01:04:39,374
Nobody's threatening you yet.
I'm offering you a trade.

740
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:42,010
She can rot in hell,
for all I care.

741
01:04:42,012 --> 01:04:44,279
<i>That's probably
an undeniable fact.</i>

742
01:04:44,281 --> 01:04:47,349
But it's up to you whether
she starts her stint tomorrow,

743
01:04:47,351 --> 01:04:50,051
or 50 years from now.
Come on, Jack.

744
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:55,090
<i>I'm giving you a real
opportunity here. Impress me.</i>

745
01:04:57,628 --> 01:05:00,395
Can you guys give us a minute?

746
01:05:01,498 --> 01:05:04,499
I can see why you like him.

747
01:05:04,501 --> 01:05:06,268
He's not going
to do the job, Eddie.

748
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:08,403
We'll see.

749
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:12,641
Jesus.
That must have been hard.

750
01:05:12,643 --> 01:05:15,043
I don't follow.

751
01:05:15,045 --> 01:05:19,314
It must have been
hard for her. Fuck.

752
01:05:19,316 --> 01:05:23,585
I hate to be the one
saying this. She fucked up.

753
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:25,487
Big time.

754
01:05:25,489 --> 01:05:28,223
But she at least tried
to do the stand-up thing

755
01:05:28,225 --> 01:05:29,925
and come clean to Eddie.

756
01:05:29,927 --> 01:05:32,394
She tried to wipe
our slates clean.

757
01:05:32,396 --> 01:05:34,930
That took guts.
She didn't have to do that.

758
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:40,335
No. She got herself into this mess.
She can get herself out.

759
01:05:40,337 --> 01:05:42,671
- Be a douche-bag.
- What?

760
01:05:42,673 --> 01:05:46,241
- Be a douche-bag.
- What?

761
01:05:46,243 --> 01:05:52,447
No matter how hard you try to be a
douche-bag, Jack, you're not a douche-bag.

762
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:57,452
I knew that the moment
you saved my life.

763
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:59,454
You could have let me down.

764
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:03,258
You can't let Karen down,
baby or no baby.

765
01:06:05,595 --> 01:06:07,295
No, no, no, no, no, no.

766
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:12,334
Not this time. Okay? You're
going to sit this one out.

767
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,473
What's the job?

768
01:06:21,712 --> 01:06:24,980
Half a bil, in diamonds.

769
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:30,719
Why can't it ever just
be a local jewelry store?

770
01:06:43,433 --> 01:06:46,468
That's Morgan Airfield,
the proverbial stomping ground

771
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:49,337
for all things clandestine
and black ops.

772
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:53,341
Our plane lands in 17 hours.
Touches down for a refuel only,

773
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:55,410
giving us a window
of 15 whole minutes.

774
01:06:55,412 --> 01:06:58,146
And all we gotta do
in that time is walk in,

775
01:06:58,148 --> 01:07:00,215
board the plane,
crack the safe,

776
01:07:00,217 --> 01:07:03,451
download the score,
and get the flock out of there.

777
01:07:03,453 --> 01:07:05,620
You say it like that,
it almost sounds doable.

778
01:07:05,622 --> 01:07:08,356
Say we even get onto
this airfield here,

779
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:10,525
do we know how many guards we're going
to be dealing with on the ground?

780
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:13,128
No. We'll have to figure
that out in real time.

781
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:16,464
I mean, but are we talking like 50 guards,
or are we talking like 100 guards?

782
01:07:16,466 --> 01:07:19,434
First things first. We gotta get onto
that airfield without getting shot.

783
01:07:19,436 --> 01:07:23,304
I'm working. Okay?
How are we going to do that?

784
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:28,309
- Manila?
- Manila?

785
01:07:28,311 --> 01:07:31,413
- Didn't work out too good for you there.
- Maybe second time's the charm.

786
01:07:31,415 --> 01:07:32,514
Who the hell is Manila?

787
01:07:32,516 --> 01:07:35,517
- She's adorable.
- Yeah.

788
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:39,187
<i>All right, Drew. Keep
them busy while I get to work.</i>

789
01:07:42,259 --> 01:07:45,727
- Check out this clown.
- Want some ice cream?

790
01:07:46,363 --> 01:07:48,329
What the fuck?

791
01:07:55,739 --> 01:07:58,506
The gate's clear, Jack.
You're good to go.

792
01:07:58,508 --> 01:08:01,176
<i>Apsara, remember,
just like Nick showed you.</i>

793
01:08:01,178 --> 01:08:05,547
<i>Aim for the truck
and just pull the trigger.</i>

794
01:08:05,549 --> 01:08:07,682
Hold your fire.
Hold your fire!

795
01:08:12,856 --> 01:08:17,725
Anyone want a lick?
Come get your ice cream! Come!

796
01:08:17,727 --> 01:08:22,363
What are you wearing?
Fuckers better run.

797
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:31,372
Move, move, move!

798
01:08:45,555 --> 01:08:49,557
<i>♪ And on his farm
he had his crew ♪</i>

799
01:08:49,559 --> 01:08:52,694
<i>♪ E-I-E-I-O ♪</i>

800
01:08:59,336 --> 01:09:01,536
All right, come on, baby.

801
01:09:03,173 --> 01:09:06,207
<i>♪ And on his farm
he had some ice cream ♪</i>

802
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:13,515
Shit!

803
01:09:14,751 --> 01:09:18,286
- Jack! Jack!
- Say again?

804
01:09:18,288 --> 01:09:21,322
<i>You gotta go. Move!</i>

805
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:25,360
I was wondering if you
were going to show up.

806
01:09:25,362 --> 01:09:28,596
What's wrong? Eddie doesn't
think I can do the job?

807
01:09:28,598 --> 01:09:31,933
Let's just say he wasn't sure Karen was
worth the half a billion.

808
01:09:31,935 --> 01:09:36,304
One man's trash and all.

809
01:09:36,306 --> 01:09:38,439
What's taking so long?

810
01:09:39,543 --> 01:09:41,910
You think you can go faster,
be my guest.

811
01:09:56,459 --> 01:10:00,528
- Got any ideas?
- Yeah.

812
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,197
One.

813
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:07,769
Ahh!

814
01:10:45,242 --> 01:10:48,843
- You owe me a vacation!
- Fine.

815
01:10:48,845 --> 01:10:51,412
Two vacations.

816
01:11:13,737 --> 01:11:17,772
Jack. You are a disappointment to me.
Karen said you were the best.

817
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:20,708
"The Michelangelo of thieves,"
to be exact.

818
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:22,377
I may be getting
a little rusty.

819
01:11:22,379 --> 01:11:23,711
<i>It's all right.
Soon you'll be dead.</i>

820
01:11:23,713 --> 01:11:26,748
Right after I shoot
Karen in the face.

821
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:29,917
Well, that's graphic.
But you might want to just wait on that.

822
01:11:29,919 --> 01:11:31,653
Could be worth
half a billion dollars.

823
01:11:31,655 --> 01:11:33,788
In case you missed it,
I have the diamonds.

824
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:36,324
If the situation were reversed,

825
01:11:36,326 --> 01:11:38,660
even I couldn't get
them back once they land.

826
01:11:38,662 --> 01:11:40,328
That's because
you're not Michelangelo.

827
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:42,797
<i>You see, Eddie,
the problem with those keygens,</i>

828
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:44,899
<i>as remarkable as they are,
they take forever.</i>

829
01:11:44,901 --> 01:11:47,035
<i>Way more than the 15 minutes
I had for refueling,</i>

830
01:11:47,037 --> 01:11:49,470
<i>but you know
what goes real fast?</i>

831
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:50,605
Semtex.

832
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:24,672
Okay, cowboy.
You have my attention.

833
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:27,642
- Bring the diamonds to...
- Negative. I'll call you with a location.

834
01:12:27,644 --> 01:12:30,511
You seem to forget
that I have the girl.

835
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:33,481
And you seem to
forget she can be a real bitch.

836
01:12:33,483 --> 01:12:37,552
It might not be worth a half
a billion dollars to me.

837
01:12:37,554 --> 01:12:40,988
Okay, Jack.
Have it your way.

838
01:13:08,418 --> 01:13:10,718
Your boy's got some sand.

839
01:13:13,056 --> 01:13:16,724
- You're not dead yet?
- Only on the inside.

840
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:24,031
- I'm sorry, Jack.
- Cozy little reunion.

841
01:13:24,033 --> 01:13:26,067
Open it up.

842
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:29,704
Yeah, I can't. Keygen's gone.
I lost it in the fall,

843
01:13:29,706 --> 01:13:33,441
but a man with your resources,
I'm sure you can figure a way into it

844
01:13:33,443 --> 01:13:36,043
in the privacy of your
own home, or lair,

845
01:13:36,045 --> 01:13:38,880
or whatever assholes
like you have.

846
01:13:40,817 --> 01:13:43,718
Oh, Jack. There's still the
little matter of me killing you.

847
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:47,455
We had a deal.

848
01:13:47,457 --> 01:13:51,159
I don't make deals with people that steal
from me. It's not good for business.

849
01:13:51,161 --> 01:13:53,995
- My sniper.
- Your sniper's fucked.

850
01:13:53,997 --> 01:13:57,732
Can't hear anything. I'm jamming
all signals transmitting out of here.

851
01:13:57,734 --> 01:14:01,869
And I hope you don't think for one second I'm
going to step out from under this thing.

852
01:14:01,871 --> 01:14:03,438
Nope.

853
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:06,674
Get down!

854
01:14:08,711 --> 01:14:11,512
Get him out of here! Go!
Come on!

855
01:14:13,216 --> 01:14:15,082
They're headed for the roof.

856
01:14:15,084 --> 01:14:18,653
Karen, move!

857
01:14:27,764 --> 01:14:29,831
911, how can I direct your call?

858
01:14:29,833 --> 01:14:32,066
<i>We just heard a bomb,
really big, and I think...</i>

859
01:14:32,068 --> 01:14:34,902
Oh, my God! There's a whole bunch
of men with guns in my hotel.

860
01:14:34,904 --> 01:14:39,707
Okay, ma'am. We have vehicles
responding right now. Just sit tight.

861
01:15:09,873 --> 01:15:12,540
911, how can I
direct your call?

862
01:15:12,542 --> 01:15:15,009
Yeah, we have vehicles
responding to you right now.

863
01:15:25,955 --> 01:15:27,622
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

864
01:15:33,563 --> 01:15:35,997
Go! Go! Go!

865
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:43,571
- Get to the roof.
- You sure don't need me, Jack?

866
01:15:43,573 --> 01:15:47,708
- I'm sure I don't need you.
- You need me, Jack.

867
01:15:56,986 --> 01:16:00,655
Ah! Shit!

868
01:16:02,025 --> 01:16:04,759
Out of ammo, Jack? Huh?

869
01:16:06,195 --> 01:16:09,864
Getting nervous?

870
01:16:26,049 --> 01:16:27,281
Fuck you!

871
01:16:33,957 --> 01:16:37,858
- Get over there, Jack! Fucker!
- Ah!

872
01:16:48,338 --> 01:16:49,870
I had him!

873
01:16:52,742 --> 01:16:54,308
Give me the gun.

874
01:16:55,078 --> 01:16:57,612
Son of a...

875
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,921
- Thanks for the help.
- You owe me three vacations, Jack.

876
01:17:06,923 --> 01:17:09,657
Looks like you're starting now.

877
01:17:22,071 --> 01:17:24,872
Move! Let's go, man! Come on!

878
01:17:25,742 --> 01:17:27,908
Stop!

879
01:17:28,645 --> 01:17:31,946
Stop! All of this,

880
01:17:31,948 --> 01:17:34,949
just to get shot up here on this roof.
That's your plan?

881
01:17:34,951 --> 01:17:37,385
Ish.

882
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:48,763
- Bang!
- Eat a dick, asshole.

883
01:18:10,253 --> 01:18:11,686
Come on!

884
01:18:30,139 --> 01:18:35,476
This will take you to Miami
and then... wherever you need to go.

885
01:18:35,478 --> 01:18:37,812
You always take care
of everything, Jack.

886
01:18:37,814 --> 01:18:40,347
Your cut.

887
01:18:41,451 --> 01:18:43,317
Seems a little light.

888
01:18:43,319 --> 01:18:46,287
You can take it up
with Logan if you'd like.

889
01:18:47,223 --> 01:18:48,989
No, I'll manage.

890
01:18:48,991 --> 01:18:52,827
- Goodbye, Karen.
- Jack...

891
01:18:52,829 --> 01:18:55,496
- Admit it.
- Admit what?

892
01:18:55,498 --> 01:19:00,935
You missed me. You missed this.
This is the most alive you've felt in a long time.

893
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:08,476
- Admit it.
- Admit what?

894
01:19:08,478 --> 01:19:13,781
You turned yourself in so we would have
to steal the diamonds and kill Eddie.

895
01:19:16,052 --> 01:19:21,422
Like I said, you always take
care of everything, Jack.

896
01:19:44,413 --> 01:19:46,413
Goodbye, Karen.

897
01:19:54,991 --> 01:19:56,991
Bye, Jack.

898
01:20:41,571 --> 01:20:45,172
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

899
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:48,342
What are you looking at?

900
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:52,112
I can't believe you just handed her
five million dollars.

901
01:20:52,114 --> 01:20:54,582
- She earned it.
- Like hell she did.

902
01:20:54,584 --> 01:20:57,518
Consider it a severance package
for you shooting her.

903
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:03,490
- That was an accident.
- "Marksmanship 101, boss. Gun target line was shit."

904
01:21:04,594 --> 01:21:07,228
You know what they
say about hookers.

905
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:13,601
No, Jack. I don't know what they
say about hookers. Enlighten me.

906
01:21:13,603 --> 01:21:17,271
You don't pay them for sex.
You pay them to leave.

907
01:21:17,273 --> 01:21:21,375
Justify it however you need to in
order to sleep at night, boss.

908
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:24,645
- Call me a softy.
- I'll call you an idiot.

909
01:21:24,647 --> 01:21:29,884
Logan, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

910
01:21:29,886 --> 01:21:32,353
Really? I see it
more as an ending.

911
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:53,374
- How's Logan?
- She's good. Thanks.

912
01:21:53,376 --> 01:21:58,545
- And whose puppy is this?
- It's mine.

913
01:21:58,547 --> 01:22:03,517
Uh, yeah, I... have proof.

914
01:22:03,519 --> 01:22:06,353
I figured you'd ask.
His name is Roy.

915
01:22:06,355 --> 01:22:09,590
- Jack, I...
- Look, Jenna, I was hoping for a second chance.

916
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:14,128
- I know I don't deserve one...
- Deserve? You want to talk about deserve?

917
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:17,264
Jack, I know I don't look like Karen,
but that doesn't mean I deserve

918
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:19,199
to be treated
the way you treated me.

919
01:22:19,201 --> 01:22:22,236
You lied to me for weeks.
You almost got me killed.

920
01:22:22,238 --> 01:22:25,205
- I...
- Just let me finish.

921
01:22:25,207 --> 01:22:27,374
Okay, I liked you, a lot.

922
01:22:27,376 --> 01:22:32,246
You were sweet, caring,
gentle, funny, smart.

923
01:22:32,248 --> 01:22:34,315
And then you were still
all of those things,

924
01:22:34,317 --> 01:22:37,551
but also this
incredible bad-ass.

925
01:22:37,553 --> 01:22:41,221
Which was actually really sexy.

926
01:22:41,223 --> 01:22:44,391
But if you want to ask me out again,
you're going to have to do more

927
01:22:44,393 --> 01:22:47,061
than just buy a puppy
and show up with flowers.

928
01:22:47,063 --> 01:22:48,529
Jenna, I... I don't...

929
01:22:48,531 --> 01:22:50,297
Okay, how about this
for starters.

930
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:52,366
You come to my office
in a few weeks,

931
01:22:52,368 --> 01:22:55,402
with your new puppy,
and if bad men haven't shown up

932
01:22:55,404 --> 01:22:59,406
with guns to kill the poor
little innocent puppy by then,

933
01:22:59,408 --> 01:23:04,411
then maybe we have a chance at having a
dinner date without bullets and boat chases.

934
01:23:04,413 --> 01:23:07,982
- Deal?
- Deal.

935
01:23:07,984 --> 01:23:11,452
And then, after an indefinite
number of dinner dates,

936
01:23:11,454 --> 01:23:15,289
assuming that no pregnant
ex-girlfriends show up,

937
01:23:15,291 --> 01:23:17,157
and no one shoots at us,

938
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:21,328
and if I don't catch you
in any more lies,

939
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:23,564
you can somehow
manage all of that,

940
01:23:23,566 --> 01:23:27,501
then maybe, just maybe,

941
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:31,372
I'll give you a reason
to fuck with the lights on.

942
01:23:36,045 --> 01:23:40,381
Told you she'd like you. Yeah.

943
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:44,752
Well, "How about
we go to dinner" is better than,

944
01:23:44,754 --> 01:23:49,423
"Go fuck yourself, Jack,
I'm calling the cops."

945
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:03,370
- Hello?
- I didn't know if you'd pick up.

946
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:05,272
I didn't know it was you.

947
01:24:06,442 --> 01:24:09,343
I deserve that.

948
01:24:09,345 --> 01:24:11,045
What do you want, Karen?

949
01:24:11,047 --> 01:24:13,080
I bought that house on St. John.

950
01:24:13,082 --> 01:24:15,082
<i>It's beautiful.
It's on the water,</i>

951
01:24:15,084 --> 01:24:16,517
<i>just like we talked about.</i>

952
01:24:16,519 --> 01:24:19,353
I'm even looking
into buying a dive shop.

953
01:24:19,355 --> 01:24:23,157
I'm happy for you, I really am,
but I don't see...

954
01:24:23,159 --> 01:24:25,426
Goddamn it! I'm no good
at apologizing, Jack.

955
01:24:25,428 --> 01:24:28,362
I've never apologized
to anyone for anything.

956
01:24:28,364 --> 01:24:31,498
Well, I mean,
I was supposed to, I just...

957
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:35,169
<i>I just didn't.</i>

958
01:24:35,171 --> 01:24:38,405
Jack, something changed me all
through all this, you know,

959
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:41,542
seeing the pain
that I caused you, I...

960
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,546
I want to be with you.

961
01:24:45,548 --> 01:24:49,416
<i>This house, the money,
without you it's...</i>

962
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:52,219
...it's boring.

963
01:24:52,221 --> 01:24:56,390
But you know what's not boring,
you know what's never boring, Jack? Us.

964
01:24:56,392 --> 01:25:00,661
- You're lonely, Karen. Find...
- I love you.

965
01:25:00,663 --> 01:25:03,597
Jack, I love you.
I think I've always loved you.

966
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:08,836
<i>And I know you love me.
We could make this work.</i>

967
01:25:08,838 --> 01:25:11,538
<i>We could be happy.</i>

968
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:15,409
<i>We can be happy.</i>

969
01:25:15,411 --> 01:25:17,711

01:25:17,713 --> 01:25:20,147

01:25:27,389 --> 01:25:30,691

Jack, seriously. Why aren't
you picking up your phone?

978
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:56,917
- Because we're pregnant!
- And we're rich!

979

he threw me out of the Army?

his two daughters!

01:26:17,206 --> 01:26:20,207
Hey, Jack, I shaved the beard,

985
01:26:20,209 --> 01:26:24,845
and you owe me two more
vacations. Two more.

986
01:26:24,847 --> 01:26:28,649
Just want you to know
I'm fuckin' done with Roy.

987
01:26:28,651 --> 01:26:32,786
He shits and pisses everywhere.
I can't, I can't deal with that.

988
01:26:32,788 --> 01:26:35,822
I'm never watching the dog
again. Look at this shit. Look.

989
01:26:35,824 --> 01:26:38,192
You wanna see? Look.

990
01:26:38,194 --> 01:26:42,529
See that shit?
All he does is fuckin' shit.

991
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:47,401
Roy, no! No!

992
01:26:47,403 --> 01:26:50,604
Jack, he's tryin' to fuck Grace.

993
01:26:51,607 --> 01:26:53,507

- I want her home by morning.
- All right.

1004
01:27:37,353 --> 01:27:39,453
I think she's a little big
for a hand off.

Just one. One.
One big one for the clap.
