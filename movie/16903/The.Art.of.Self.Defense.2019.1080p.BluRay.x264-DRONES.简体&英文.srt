00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,490
��δЯ��ǹ֧���ܺ��߸��п��ܱ�ǹɱ
much more likely to be shot and killed than an unarmed victim.

138
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,330
��ɱ�ڳ�ǹ����Ҳ������
Suicide is more common with gun owners too.

139
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,910
��һ���ᰮ����ǹ�ĸо�
You're really gonna love owning a gun.

00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,460

I'm sure you're right.

Karate is a language.

143
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,930
����һ�ֹ�ͨ��ʽ
It's a way of communicating.

00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,350

When you were a child,

145
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,350
��ѵ�������񶯿���˵������
you trained your vocal chords to manipulate air to make words.

146
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,330
��������ѧϰ��ΰѵ�����ϵ�һ��
And then you learned how to combine those words together

147
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,570
�γɾ���
so that they would form sentences.

148
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,320
��Щ���ӿ��Ա��￴��  ����  ����
And those sentences expressed thoughts, wants, needs...

149
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:23,410

Every conversation that you had was honing your skills.

00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,750

And now, after all these years,

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,040

you are black belts in speech.

So, at this point in your karate training,

153
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:44,640
��������ѧϰ�����ȭ���������
you are learning how to form words with your fists and with your feet.

154
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,970

The hardest part of your karate journey is

walking through that door for the first time.

��һ�ǿ��ֵ�ն�۶϶��ֵĸ첲
Snapping an opponent's arm with a karate chop,

184
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,400

that would be one way.

Or shattering their jaw with a perfectly placed spinning wheel kick

is alleviate the pressure on your neck.

Your center of gravity needs to be lower than mine,

and she teaches the children's class.

The only two people here with red stripes are her and Sensei.

00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,210

And what about the black stripe?

269
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:59,700

Sensei only gives those to select students. Green belt and up.

Today's your first day though. I wouldn't worry about stripes.

271
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:14,540

It is wise to respect the past but foolish to ignore innovation.

Grand Master understood this.

He would say,

"��Ч���������Ǻ�����"
"The only moves worth learning are the ones that work."

275
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,110

Just 'cause I'm a karateka

276
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,360
���ⲻ��ζ���Ҳ����
doesn't mean that I wouldn't teach

or an inside heel hook from Russian sambo.

279
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,660

I would teach a reverse wrist splicer

Rule number 10.

You all right?

That punch got away from me.

Okay, uh, that was a good first try.

That felt a little more like a kick than a punch though.

301
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,230

It felt like a kick to me too.

302
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,330

Your whole life, you've known that a foot can only kick.

You've known that a foot cannot punch.

Forget everything that you know.

Much better. That felt like a punch.

306
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,890

A very weak punch,

307
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,100

but the most important thing

308
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,960
���Ѿ�ѧ���ýų�ȭ��
is that you're learning to punch with your foot.

Let me show you again.

Think of it as you striking my foot with your body.

That makes perfect sense.

You have a wonderful sense of balance.

He was mistaken for a bird by a hunter carrying a shotgun.

this gun was imprecise and boorish.

That board isn't just for children.

The rules apply to all of us.

It is the highest honor in all of karate.

He achieved this rank after he challenged and defeated

He finished each fight with his signature technique.

A technique only he knew.

A technique he never even taught me.

433
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:36,110

He punched through his opponents' heads with his index finger.

He was the greatest man who ever lived.

of Grand Master being shot and killed while on a hike

This student has been with us from the very beginning.

They are unquestioning.

This concludes the ceremony.

474
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,300

you can prove them wrong first with tangible evidence,

Everyone, I'd like you to welcome Casey to the night class.

He's a yellow belt.

All right. Let's begin.

So is he.

670
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:17,750

Can you drag him off the mat?

671
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,050

Learn to love this feeling.

672
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:34,670

Your bones aching. Your chest screaming.

This is karate.

Congratulations on a great class, everyone.

Let's begin the cool-down.

677
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,420
���Ƕ����ڵ����Ϸ���
They're all gonna cool down on the mat,

678
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:22,590
�����������һ���Ͽ�
but since it's your first time,

679
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:24,510
�㲻�ܸ�����һ�����
I want you to cool down away from the others.

680
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:26,400
������
Come with me.

681
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,840
��֪�������ǰ������е�����
I know you're probably a little confused about what's happening.

682
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:50,760
��ֻҪ֪��  ����ÿ��ѧԱ
Just know that every one of them out there

683
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,230

had to do this at one point.

684
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:04,280
�ٴα�Ǹ  �������һ�����
Again, I'm sorry to make you cool down with her.

685
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:07,980
����Ů��  �����ֲ�����������������
She's a woman so her hands are naturally weaker than a man's.

686
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:11,350
ǿ�������ָ��ʺ����˶���Ħ
An after-workout sports massage works best with strong hands,

687
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:12,970
������֪���ⲻ�Ǻ�����
so I know this is not ideal.

688
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:16,220
����Ů�˵İ�Ħ���Ǳ��Լ���Ħǿ
A massage from a woman is still better than a self-massage.

Well, what are you waiting for, yellow belt?

Take off your jacket and sit in front of me.

Sorry.

692
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:54,930

I know they're not as strong as a man's.

693
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,220

So, this is the women's changing room.

694
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:03,910

It is.

695
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:06,700
���ڸ����涼���и�����һ��
It's the same as the men's in every way,

696
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,360

only it's smaller and not as nice.

697
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,620

How long have you been taking karate?

698
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,280

I was one of the Dojo's first students when it opened.

699
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,190

And how long have you been a brown belt?

700
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,190

The cool-down is supposed to be silent.

701
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,270

Why was he promoted to black belt before you?

702
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:32,550

Is that why you fought him tonight?

703
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:35,650

You could have killed him.

Never hold back.

708
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:48,320

Not ever.

709
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:52,540

It will only make you weak, and you can't be weak anymore.

Not in the night classes.

711

Do you understand?

712
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:01,510

I think I do.

713
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,950

But then again, maybe I don't.

You will.

715
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:14,470

This isn't a safe place, Casey.

716
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:30,630

My turn.

717
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:37,160

You can come in.

Your belt. It's yellow.

719
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,140

I had it made.

720
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:53,040
Ϊ�˿��Դ����ճ�����
It's for everyday use with casual clothing.

721
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:56,080

Obviously, I chose yellow because I am a yellow belt.

722
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:58,170
����Ҫһֱ�������ҵĻƴ�
I wanted to wear my yellow belt all the time

723
01:00:58,170 --> 01:00:59,940

but I knew it would look strange.

724
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,020

That really is a wonderful idea.

725
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:05,900
��ʵ˵  ��ϣ�������뵽�������
To be honest, I wish I'd thought of it.

726
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:08,010
���ڳ����ڵ���֮��
Now I can be a yellow belt in everyday life,

727
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:09,730

in addition to being one in this dojo.

728
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:13,210

I mentioned before that I had it made.

729
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:14,950

It was a special order.

730
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:17,670
������  ������˾���Ͻ�һ�������Ķ���
The thing is, the belt company wouldn't make just one.

731
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,400

I had to make at least 50.

732
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:26,540

The positive out of this is

733
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:28,480
�����㹻�����������͸�����ѧԱ��
that I have enough for all the other students.

734
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,570

I even had them make a black one for you.

735
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:34,590

I think it turned out quite nice.

and there are things in life that women do.

There are some things that women and men do together,

01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:07,220

It was another student.

The highest ranked at the time, other than Sensei.

01:21:24,910 --> 01:21:26,580

I was better than him.

I knew it, but I also knew my place.

1007
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,190

And during the sparring sessions,

1008
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:35,120
�Ҷ�����Ӯ  ��Ϊ�Ҳ������ҽ׼�����
I let him win 'cause I didn't want to upset the hierarchy.

1009
01:21:35,210 --> 01:21:38,190
�����Ҳע�⵽��  ���ֵ����н׼���
As you've probably noticed, there's a hierarchy in karate.

1010
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:42,950
��ʱ  ������ֻ��һ�������
At this point, the dojo only had one changing room,

1011
01:21:43,810 --> 01:21:46,340

so I would wait until the men finished changing,

1012
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:48,050

then I would get dressed alone.

1013
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:51,660

And one night, as I was getting undressed,

1014
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:54,840
�Ǹ��߶�λѧԱ����  �ӱ���Ϯ������
the upper belt came in and attacked me from behind.

1015
01:21:56,450 --> 01:21:58,050

I'd always held back in class,

1016
01:21:58,050 --> 01:22:01,010

so he saw me as weak.

1017
01:22:02,510 --> 01:22:04,200
��������
An easy target.

1018
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:09,710
�����������������������
I ended up strangling him to death with his own belt.

1019
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:13,300

I made him suffer.

1020
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:18,330
��������ǰ��󿴵��ľ���
And the last thing he saw before his eyes burst was

1021
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:21,100
�����ϵ�����֮ɫ
the sense of satisfaction on my face.

1022
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:25,160
�������Ҳ�������
He saw that I was not weak,

1023
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,550

but strong.

1024
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:31,570

1025
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:35,460

After that, Sensei had the old equipment closet

1026
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:37,580

converted into the women's changing room.

01:31:31,780 --> 01:31:33,430
����֪��ԭ����
Do you want to know why?

1059
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:39,630
�ҿ���˵����Ϊ�˵���������
I could say it's for the honor of the dojo.

1060
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:44,070
�ҿ���˵����Ϊ������������ѧԱ
I could tell you it's because you're blackmailing former students

1061
01:31:44,070 --> 01:31:47,340
�������뿪����Ȼ���ڽ��ɻ�Ա��
into paying membership fees long after they leave.

1062
01:31:48,730 --> 01:31:50,980

Or because private lessons

1063
01:31:51,260 --> 01:31:53,870
��ǿ�Ӹ�ѧԱ��˽�˿γ�
are given to those who do not ask for them.

Like myself.

1065
01:31:58,040 --> 01:32:00,860
����ʵԭ����  �Һ���
But really it's because I hate you.

1066
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:04,970
�Ҽ������
I hate you very much.

1067
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:08,740
�Ҳ�����Ҫ����
And not only do I want to watch you die,

1068
01:32:08,910 --> 01:32:11,990
�һ���Ҫ����ɱ����
but I want to be the reason that you stop breathing.

1069
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:16,890
�Ҵ�δ��˿�����
I've never wanted anything more in my entire life.

I'm going to kill you, Leslie.

1071
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:27,490

That's right.

1072
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:30,720

I found out that your real name is Leslie.

1073
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:33,630
����ô������Ϊ�˼�ŭ��
I called you that to make you angry.

1074
01:32:34,490 --> 01:32:35,870

When you think about it,

1075
01:32:35,870 --> 01:32:39,600
��˹���ȿ�����Ů�Ի�
Leslie is a lot more feminine-sounding than Casey.

1076
01:32:41,990 --> 01:32:43,680
�ҿ��������Ϊ�ڴ�
I can make you a black belt.

1077
01:32:43,970 --> 01:32:45,570

You can skip all the other colors.

1078
01:32:45,570 --> 01:32:47,100

You don't even need to earn it.

1079
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:54,430
����ս�����ͽ��������
I challenge you to a fight to the death, in unarmed combat.

1080
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:57,700

You'll lose.

1081
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:01,580

I'm better at fighting than you.

1082
01:33:09,970 --> 01:33:11,030
�Ǻ�
Very well.

1083
01:33:13,130 --> 01:33:14,310
�ҽ���
I accept.

1084
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:48,470
�����˺ܾ�
I've been thinking a lot lately,

1085
01:34:48,870 --> 01:34:51,470
ɱ����֮����Ӧ��˵ʲô
about what I would say to you after I killed you.

1086
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:54,930
���뵽������˵��
I came up with two things,

1087
01:34:55,230 --> 01:34:57,680
�����Ҳ���֮����
and I don't want to second-guess my choice later on,

1088
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:59,560
������������Ҫ˵
so I'm going to say both.

1089
01:35:00,610 --> 01:35:05,910
��һ  ���˵  ��ǹ˵��������
First, you would say that using this makes me a weak man,

1090
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:08,050
��ȷ  ��һ����ӹ����
and without question, it does.

1091
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:11,450
���һ��Ŷ�������
But I am alive and you are dead,

1092
01:35:11,450 --> 01:35:14,620
�����Ҫָ��  ��˵�������
so I would argue it makes you the weaker man.

1093
01:35:17,140 --> 01:35:20,700
���뵽�ĵڶ���˵���Ǵ�һ����Ӱ�￴����
The second thing I came up with is from a film I saw once.

1094
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:24,060
�Ҳ����ع��
I didn't play by the rules,

1095
01:35:24,650 --> 01:35:27,290
��Ϊ���ϱ��޹��
but there never were any rules.

1096
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:42,570
����ͽ���������л�������
I defeated him in unarmed combat to the death.

1097
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:45,020
��ѭ���Ǵ�ʦ�Ĵ�ͳ
In the tradition of our Grand Master,

1098
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:48,290
�����ҵ�ʳָ����������ͷ
I punched a hole through his head with my index finger.

1099
01:35:48,570 --> 01:35:53,110
���б���ֻ�д�ʦ��  ������Ҳ����
It was a move that only Grand Master knew but now I know it too.

1100
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:55,870
����ô����Ϊ�˹⸴��ʦ
I did it to restore honor to Grand Master,

1101
01:35:55,870 --> 01:35:57,970
���ѧԺ��ѧԱ������
this academy and its students.

1102
01:35:57,970 --> 01:35:59,660
���˶Դ��������
Does anybody have a problem with that?

1103
01:35:59,660 --> 01:36:01,150
���������Ļ�
Because if you do, I'm happy

1104
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:03,530
��Ҳ����������ָ�������ͷ­
to punch my finger through your skull too.

1105
01:36:08,190 --> 01:36:11,220
�ܺ�  �ҽ���ɱ���˹�����
Good. I've killed enough people for today.

1106
01:36:12,190 --> 01:36:15,380
����������  ����һ����
On second thought, there is one more thing.

1107
01:36:15,700 --> 01:36:18,130
�����˰��������
Everyone hold their hands out in front of them.

1108
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:22,900
�����˵�ڶ���
Don't make me ask again.

1109
01:36:48,570 --> 01:36:49,800
������ô��
What's this for?

1110
01:36:51,690 --> 01:36:53,430
��Ť��������
I sprained my wrist.

1111
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:57,480
-����ôŤ�˵�  -������
- How did you sprain it? - Playing guitar.

1112

How are you with chords and scales?

1114
01:37:02,710 --> 01:37:05,980
���ò���  �м��������Ҹ����ó�
I'm good with them. I can play several songs quite well.

1115
01:37:06,610 --> 01:37:09,510
��Ť������ʱ������ʲô���͵�����
What type of music were you playing when you sprained your wrist?

1116
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:10,750
��ҡ��
Soft rock.

1117
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:14,320
-�⿪����  -Ϊʲô
- Take off the bandage. - Why?

1118
01:37:14,590 --> 01:37:17,720
��Ϊ��ҡ�������ܻ�Ť���������
Because it is impossible to sprain your wrist playing soft rock.

1119
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:20,320

Only extreme metal can do that.

01:39:04,230 --> 01:39:06,500

you've been taught that violence equals strength

and compassion equals weakness.

1134

This ideology is limiting.

1135

It is possible to be brutally tolerant or peacefully savage.
