Suicide is more common with gun owners too.

Karate is a language.

It's a way of communicating.

When you were a child,

you trained your vocal chords to manipulate air to make words.

Stripes.

261
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,550
���l�����M���c�ɾ�
Stripes signify advancements and achievements.

262
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,590
�tɫ���l��ʲô��˼
What does the red stripe mean?

263
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,680
��˼�Ǵ������ڸ��К����ˌ���
It means the person has killed another person in combat.

264

���fЦ��  �Ǵ����̎�
I'm joking. It's for instructors.

Anna, the brown belt, has a red stripe

and she teaches the children's class.

The only two people here with red stripes are her and Sensei.

00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:59,700
�ώ�ֻ�o�ض��W�T�ڗl  �G�����ϵČW�T
Sensei only gives those to select students. Green belt and up.

Today's your first day though. I wouldn't worry about stripes.

271
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:14,540

It is wise to respect the past but foolish to ignore innovation.

272
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,630
�󎟶����@������
Grand Master understood this.

273
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,150

He would say,

274

"��Ч���Д����Ǻ��Д�"
"The only moves worth learning are the ones that work."

275
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,110

Just 'cause I'm a karateka

276
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,360
���@����ζ���Ҳ�����
doesn't mean that I wouldn't teach

or an inside heel hook from Russian sambo.

279
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,660

I would teach a reverse wrist splicer

and if it wasn't something I just made up.

Rule number 10.

That punch got away from me.

00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,270

That felt a little more like a kick than a punch though.

It felt like a kick to me too.

You've known that a foot cannot punch.

Much better. That felt like a punch.

306
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,890

A very weak punch,

307
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,100

but the most important thing

308
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,960

is that you're learning to punch with your foot.

Let me show you again.

Think of it as you striking my foot with your body.

That makes perfect sense.

Black stripes.

The color black represents night. As in "night class."

I think I'll stick with the day class.

Now that I think about it,

you're much more suited to the day class.

Today's a special day.

408
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,620
���H�H���ゃ����һЩ��
Not only is it a day in which we recognize those of you

it is also an important anniversary.

00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,150

Seven years ago today,

412
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:13,210
����һ�����ҵ��h�������ⱻ��
Grand Master was killed in a tragic hiking accident

413
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,820

where he was shot in the face with a gun.

414
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,410
һ���y���������īC�˰������B�`����
He was mistaken for a bird by a hunter carrying a shotgun.

415
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,970
�ǷN��һ������
Type of gun that fires a cartridge

����Ŀ��������ʮ����ʮ�w�ӏ�

417
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,390
�����҂��ʴ_�ɴ�Ŀ��ֵ�
Unlike our karate, which is clean and precise,

418
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:31,710
�ǷN���ȴֲ���Ұ�U
this gun was imprecise and boorish.

419
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:33,760

Rule number 11.

420
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,340

Guns are for the weak.

421
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,430
�װ��ϵ�Ҏ�ز�ֹ�ǽoС������
That board isn't just for children.

422
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,770
Ҏ���m�����҂�������
The rules apply to all of us.

423
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:01,050
����Ψһһ��
Grand Master is the only person ever

424
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:03,450

to wear the rainbow belt.

425
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:08,960
�������Լ�����  �Լ��C�l�������ɫ
It's a belt color that he created and awarded to himself.

426
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:12,380
���ǿ��ֵ�����ߵ��ɫ���e
It is the highest honor in all of karate.

427
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,310
����ͽ����������
He achieved this rank after he challenged and defeated

428
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,150
���𲢓����˱������������󎟺�
all three other grand masters in the state

in unarmed combat to the death.

430
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,980
��ÿ�ζ����Լ���־�Ե��Д��K�Y��
He finished each fight with his signature technique.

431
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,940
һ�Nֻ���������Д�
A technique only he knew.

432
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,770
һ�N����δ���ڽo�ҵ��Д�
A technique he never even taught me.

433
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:36,110
��������ʳָ�������ֵ��^
He punched through his opponents' heads with his index finger.

434
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,530
������ʷ�ԁ�������
He was the greatest man who ever lived.

435
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,290
�������������C�l��
I do not award belts.

436
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,790

My students earn them.

437
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,770
�@��һ�l����Ҫ���oһ����
And this first belt goes to someone

438
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:58,470
���������Ͽ�����һ�c�Լ���Ӱ��
who I see a little of myself in.

439
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,640

He has devoted himself to karate,

440
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,810
����ȫ�A���˴��Sɫ�ę���
and he has more than earned the right to wear the color yellow.

441
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:12,190
�P��
Casey.

442
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,210

The progression from yellow belt to green belt

443
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:02,490
��Ҫ�����ķ�I����ʡ
is one of great sacrifice and introspection.

444
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,910
�ǰ������y��Ӌ���ă���֮��
It is filled with immeasurable pain, both internal and external.

445
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,590
���x�ゃ���ǰ��֧�ֱ˴�

"Something black."

Well, I was saving it till the very end for dramatic effect.

00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,700

As I said before, today is a special day.

458
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,140
���H�H�������Ǵ����h����
Not only because it is the unfortunate anniversary

459
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,430
���C�ˮ����B�`����
of Grand Master being shot and killed while on a hike

after being mistaken for a bird by a hunter.

463
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,970
�@���W�T�����_ʼ��ͬ�҂���һ��
This student has been with us from the very beginning.

464
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,020

They are unquestioning.

465

they will always be my student,

471

Black is higher than brown. Please move over to your left.

This concludes the ceremony.

00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,760

474
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,300

475
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,710

you can prove them wrong first with tangible evidence,

and then in combat.

Our limbs get their strength from leverage points.

An elbow can only bend one way

When she earned her blue belt,

I put her in charge of the children's class

I realize now that her being a woman

will prevent her from ever becoming a man.

1008
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:35,120
�Ҷ�׌���A  ����Ҳ���_�y�A������
I let him win 'cause I didn't want to upset the hierarchy.

1009
01:21:35,210 --> 01:21:38,190

As you've probably noticed, there's a hierarchy in karate.

1010
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:42,950

At this point, the dojo only had one changing room,

1011
01:21:43,810 --> 01:21:46,340

so I would wait until the men finished changing,

then I would get dressed alone.

1013
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:51,660

And one night, as I was getting undressed,

1014
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:54,840
�ǂ��߶�λ�W�T�M��  �ı����u������
the upper belt came in and attacked me from behind.

1015
01:21:56,450 --> 01:21:58,050

I'd always held back in class,

1016
01:21:58,050 --> 01:22:01,010

so he saw me as weak.

1017
01:22:02,510 --> 01:22:04,200

An easy target.

1018
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:09,710

I ended up strangling him to death with his own belt.

1019
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:13,300

I made him suffer.

1020
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:18,330

And the last thing he saw before his eyes burst was

1021
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:21,100
��Ę�ϵĝM��֮ɫ
the sense of satisfaction on my face.

1022
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:25,160

He saw that I was not weak,

After that, Sensei had the old equipment closet

but there never were any rules.
