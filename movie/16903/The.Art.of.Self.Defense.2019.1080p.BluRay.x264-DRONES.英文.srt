18
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,420
- Hi there. - Hello.

20
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,060
Espresso.

21
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,480
We've just got the regular type of coffee here.

22
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,980
Two, please.

29
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:15,600
Okay.

41
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,530
Bonjour. You have completed lesson 25.

42
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,320
Well done.

43
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,860
At this point, you should have a firm grasp of the French language.

44
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,020
Let's continue.

47
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,140
I wish I would have been able to see that.

48
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,330
Grant is without a doubt

49
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,980
the worst boss on the face of the Earth.

50
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,310
One of these days, I'm going to punch him in the goddamn throat.

51
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,670
I can promise you that.

52
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,590
- Are you talking about Grant? - We are.

53
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:39,110
I was thinking we should pull an office prank on Grant, you know.

54
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,870
Put, like, an air horn under his chair,

55
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,310
so when he sits down, it makes a really loud noise.

56
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,410
Or set fire to his house. Something along those lines.

57
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,270
I think Maggie gave birth recently.

58
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,030
Grant's wife, Maggie. Actually, I... I know she did.

59
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,900
I went to the cookout at his house last weekend

60
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,920
and they were there with their new baby,

61
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,570
along with their two other children.

62
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,740
It was actually a really nice cookout.

63
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,790
Quality meats and sides.

64
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,430
There was even a raffle for a gift card

65
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,040
to that new restaurant in town.

66
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,940
Most of the office was there.

67
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,600
Some of them even wore their swimsuits.

68
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:18,260
So, maybe burning down the house isn't the best...

69
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,660
But, yeah... Yeah, sometimes...

70
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,540
Sometimes here at the office, Grant will give me an assignment,

71
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,440
such as auditing an expense report,

72
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,470
and even though it's part of my job, reports and auditing,

73
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,860
it can be frustrating.

74
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,910
What's that magazine you're reading?

75
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,160
What department are you in?

76
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,780
Accounting.

77
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,540
So you're the one who audits our expense reports?

78
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,160
Yeah.

79
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,460
Get the fuck out of here.

81
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,370
I'm sorry. I didn't know we were out.

82
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,320
Do you have a gun?

83
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,200
What?

85
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,620
No, no, no, no. Please don't.

86
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,660
Here, here. You can take my wallet.

87
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:17,170
There's $10 plus a gift card to the new restaurant in town.

88
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,800
Why are you doing this?

89
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,880
There was yet another mugging last night,

90
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,900
this one putting a 35-year old dog owner in critical condition.

91
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,340
The motorcycle-riding assailants are still at large.

92
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,510
Daddy, there's a doggy in here.

93
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,850
In an official statement,

94
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,560
police are urging residents to stay indoors after dark,

95
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,850
adding that if you must go outside, you should carry a weapon,

96
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,250
such as a gun or a large knife.

97
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,420
You have only one unheard message.

98
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:10,030
Hey, Casey. Uh, this is Grant. Your boss. From work.

99
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,780
Just calling to check in on you, see how you're doing.

100
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,870
I just want you to know, you can take all the time you need.

101
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,130
We can keep you on paid leave for another week

102
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,020
and then it'll just start counting towards your vacation time.

103
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,870
but you've got so much of that built up,

104
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,480
so I wouldn't be concerned.

105
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,420
Hey, um, maybe you could take that trip to France you're always talking about.

106
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,840
I hear the people there are lovely

107
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,530
and the food is supposed to be...

108
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,620
No one else left you a message.

109
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,100
I'm sorry. I can't go out there.

110
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,290
This isn't how it was supposed to be.

111
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,250
I was supposed to win. You didn't play by the rules.

112
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,340
There never were any rules.

113
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,040
Can I help you?

114
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,660
I'm interested in buying a gun.

115
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:43,910
Are you a hunter?

116
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,060
No. It would be for self-defense.

117
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,090
I need something that can fit into my hand.

118
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,800
Sounds like you're after a handgun.

119
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,430
How about something like this?

120
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,820
Yes. This is exactly what I'm looking for.

121
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,730
I can hold it in my hand quite easily.

122
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,080
I'll run the background check and file the necessary paperwork.

123
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,890
Yeah. Is there some sort of box you can put this in, or a bag?

124
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,220
Sorry. There's a waiting period

125
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,380
before you can legally purchase this gun.

126
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,020
It's so a person who is upset with another person

127
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,840
can't come in here and buy a gun to shoot that person with.

128
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,050
Instead, they have to wait a little while before they can do that.

129
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,740
- Do you have any children? - No, I don't. Just a dog.

130
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,570
Good. If you did have children,

131
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,570
I would warn you that the risk of accidental death

132
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,580
increases drastically with a gun in the home,

133
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,870
but since you don't have any children,

134
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,900
that statistic is irrelevant to you.

135
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,210
You did mention self-defense though. Be cautious.

136
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,290
In a violent altercation, an armed victim is

137
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,490
much more likely to be shot and killed than an unarmed victim.

138
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,330
Suicide is more common with gun owners too.

139
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,910
You're really gonna love owning a gun.

140
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,460
I'm sure you're right.

142
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,670
Karate is a language.

143
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,930
It's a way of communicating.

144
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,350
When you were a child,

145
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,350
you trained your vocal chords to manipulate air to make words.

146
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,330
And then you learned how to combine those words together

147
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,570
so that they would form sentences.

148
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,320
And those sentences expressed thoughts, wants, needs...

149
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:23,410
Every conversation that you had was honing your skills.

150
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,750
And now, after all these years,

151
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,040
you are black belts in speech.

152
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,800
So, at this point in your karate training,

153
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:44,640
you are learning how to form words with your fists and with your feet.

154
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,970
You're gonna get to the point where you don't even have to think about it.

155
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,350
Ask me a question.

156
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,900
What... What are your plans for the weekend?

157
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:01,280
I'm going to do some grocery shopping and rent a film.

158
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,710
Perhaps a comedy

159
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,870
to watch

160
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,490
in the comfort

161
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,580
of my own

162
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,910
home.

163
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,760
Did that answer your question?

164
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,190
That's it for today. Bow to me.

165
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,400
Bow to Grand Master.

166
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,360
I hope it's...

167
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,160
I hope it's all right that I watched.

168
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,810
The hardest part of your karate journey is

169
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,430
walking through that door for the first time.

170
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,130
That's where most people fail.

171
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,510
- What was your name? - Case...Casey.

172
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,720
My name is Sensei.

173
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,740
Can anyone take classes?

174
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,640
The first lesson is free,

175
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,770
so why don't you come in tomorrow and give it a shot?

176
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,190
I'll try.

177
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,800
Higher, Manny. You must attain the proper angle.

178
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,470
Remember, you're punching his nose up into his brain.

179
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,490
The key word is "up."

180
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,080
Okay, class, line up.

181
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,630
We're gonna work on a rear naked strangle.

182
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,340
With karate, our goal is always to end a fight with strikes.

183
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,270
Snapping an opponent's arm with a karate chop,

184
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,400
that would be one way.

185
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,000
Or shattering their jaw with a perfectly placed spinning wheel kick

186
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,260
would be another.

187
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,200
But realistically, when engaged in combat,

188
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,100
it is not a matter of if a fight will end up on the ground.

189
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,900
It's a matter of when.

190
00:16:58,950 --> 00:16:59,770
Manny.

191
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,070
This is called "taking the back."

192
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,950
I am in the dominant position.

193
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:11,030
He is a mouse. I am a python.

194
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,330
I slide my arm around his neck, my elbow under his chin.

195
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:21,000
Like a python, I slowly begin to squeeze my mouse.

196
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,940
My arm cuts off the carotid arteries on either side of his neck,

197
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,470
starving the brain of oxygenated blood.

198
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,890
Students, what is rule number eight?

199
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,270
Tap or take a nap.

201
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,230
Tap or take a nap.

202
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,030
Okay, let's give this technique a try.

203
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,870
Bow to me.

204
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,330
Bow to Grand Master.

205
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,380
Hi there.

206
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,720
You're an excellent teacher.

207
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,950
Usually, it's the mothers that bring the children, not the fathers.

208
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,060
Which one's yours?

209
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,700
I'm not a parent.

210
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,500
I'm actually a new student. I'm taking my first class today.

211
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,960
- You're a new white belt? - Is that the first belt color?

212
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,820
White is before color. You haven't earned color yet.

213
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,960
That makes sense, actually.

214
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,880
I think I need to borrow a uniform for class.

215
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,420
I was going to ask Sensei but I didn't see him...

216
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,290
And you're lucky he doesn't see you.

217
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,260
You're lucky he doesn't see some white belt

218
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,830
disrespecting his dojo and everything he's built.

219
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,500
What is the first rule?

220
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,090
The board is behind you. What's rule number one?

222
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,050
No shoes on the mat.

223
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,560
Take off your fucking shoes, white belt.

224
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,080
You need a gi and you need a belt. Is that what you're asking?

225
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,290
Yes.

226
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,040
But say I'm at an ATM...

227
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,560
and as my back is turned, a man grabs my throat from behind.

228
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,170
- Okay. May I? - Of course.

229
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,170
In this instance,

230
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,940
the first thing you always have to do

231
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,800
is alleviate the pressure on your neck.

232
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,740
Your center of gravity needs to be lower than mine,

233
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,020
so drop your hips.

234
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,870
- Like this? - Exactly.

235
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,190
Now you can lift me off my feet with ease.

236
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,690
Good.

237
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,580
See, even though I have your back,

238
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,360
you are now in the dominant position.

239
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,950
I have no control and I can easily be thrown.

240
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,680
- This is very effective. - Yes, it is.

241
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,290
What if they're resisting more?

242
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,290
Show me.

243
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,340
I see what you mean. I would probably, uh...

244
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,550
I'd probably do something like that.

245
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,560
There's a lot of testosterone in this dojo.

246
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,020
That's a hormone men produce.

247
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,530
Women produce it too but men produce much more.

248
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,280
Is this your first class?

249
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,580
- It is. - Here, let me help with that.

250
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,500
You gotta start from the front, not the back.

251
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,600
I notice that your belt is blue.

252
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,150
It is. Um, I feel a connection to the color blue.

253
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,590
- It suits me. - Is blue a high rank?

254
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,320
Blue is one of the middle colors.

255
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:21,580
The order is white, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, black.

256
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,300
Some schools use different colors

257
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,600
or change the order of the colors,

258
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,620
but our academy does it this way and it's definitely the best way.

259
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,310
- And what do the strips of tape mean? - They're called "stripes."

260
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,100
Stripes.

261
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,550
Stripes signify advancements and achievements.

262
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,590
What does the red stripe mean?

263
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,680
It means the person has killed another person in combat.

264
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,990
I'm joking. It's for instructors.

265
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,990
Anna, the brown belt, has a red stripe

266
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,810
and she teaches the children's class.

267
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,860
The only two people here with red stripes are her and Sensei.

268
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,210
And what about the black stripe?

269
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:59,700
Sensei only gives those to select students. Green belt and up.

270
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,370
Today's your first day though. I wouldn't worry about stripes.

271
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:14,540
It is wise to respect the past but foolish to ignore innovation.

272
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,630
Grand Master understood this.

273
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,150
He would say,

274
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:22,800
"The only moves worth learning are the ones that work."

275
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,110
Just 'cause I'm a karateka

276
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,360
doesn't mean that I wouldn't teach

277
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,450
a bow and arrow choke from Brazilian jiujitsu,

278
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,400
or an inside heel hook from Russian sambo.

279
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,660
I would teach a reverse wrist splicer

280
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,370
from Mongolian judo if it worked

281
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,150
and if it wasn't something I just made up.

282
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,940
Rule number 10.

283
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,950
If it works, use it.

284
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,870
Which brings me to today's lesson.

285
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,580
To kick with your fists,

286
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,250
and punch with your feet.

287
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,000
I'm Kennith. What's your name?

288
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,420
Casey.

289
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,380
I'm glad you chose karate, Casey.

290
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,600
It's an excellent martial art and will likely change your life.

291
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,890
- Would you like to go first? - Maybe you should go first.

292
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:10,810
Okay.

293
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,040
- Not in the day class. - Sorry, Sensei.

294
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,900
I forgot where I was. It was an accident.

295
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,740
You all right?

296
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,120
I'm really glad you're here.

297
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,920
That punch got away from me.

298
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,670
I apologize. Would you like to try?

299
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,640
Okay, uh, that was a good first try.

300
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,270
That felt a little more like a kick than a punch though.

301
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,230
It felt like a kick to me too.

302
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,330
Your whole life, you've known that a foot can only kick.

303
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,480
You've known that a foot cannot punch.

304
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,940
Forget everything that you know.

305
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,580
Much better. That felt like a punch.

306
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,890
A very weak punch,

307
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,100
but the most important thing

308
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,960
is that you're learning to punch with your foot.

309
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,960
Let me show you again.

310
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,840
Don't think of it as me punching your body with my foot.

311
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:29,930
Think of it as you striking my foot with your body.

312
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,390
That makes perfect sense.

313
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,440
You have a wonderful sense of balance.

314
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,860
I wanna sign up for classes.

315
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,070
That's excellent news.

316
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,270
I'm gonna go ahead and enter you into the system.

317
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:12,110
- Name? Casey... - Davies.

318
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:15,400
That's a very feminine-sounding name.

319
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,790
- Age? - I turn 36 next month.

320
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,510
Do you know what that is in months?

321
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,040
The system does it in months.

322
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,680
Four hundred and thirty-two minus one

323
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:47,980
is 431 months old.

324
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,610
That sounds old when you put it that way.

325
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,900
Why karate?

326
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,220
This question is multiple-choice.

327
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,340
"A, health and fitness. B, career opportunity.

328
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:10,080
"C, New Year's resolution. D, self-defense/traumatic experience."

329
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,840
What if it's none of the above?

330
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:17,050
- Should I read the choices again? - No, that's okay.

331
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,050
A, health and fitness.

332
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,740
This is the equipment room.

333
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:42,070
- This room is off limits. You understand? - Okay.

334
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,580
Wait here, please.

335
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,560
This is your belt.

336
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,560
Do not come to class without your belt.

337
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:17,360
It is yours. It is sacred.

338
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,280
There'll be a $15 charge to replace a lost belt.

339
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,270
- Hello? - Hi.

340
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,360
May I speak to Ms. Casey Davies, please?

341
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,930
This is him. I'm a man.

342
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,600
My mistake. I thought it was a woman's name.

343
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:53,690
- Who is this? - I'm calling about your gun, the handgun.

344
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,060
Wait. I remember you now.

345
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,330
Yes, you are a man. Again, apologies.

346
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:57,980
That's all right.

347
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,330
It looks like your paperwork

348
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:01,670
is gonna go through without any complications.

349
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,290
Tomorrow morning,

350
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,110
you will be able to come in and purchase your gun.

351
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,830
- Are you still there? - I don't need a gun anymore.

352
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,910
You're not having a child, are you?

353
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:13,930
Because we sell child safety locks that work reasonably well.

354
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,500
No. No child. I just...

355
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,250
I found something else.

356
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,920
Don't tell me you bought a knife.

357
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,600
Knives are good for self-defense too,

358
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,650
but nine times out of 10, a person with a knife

359
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:26,260
who gets into a fight with a person with a gun will lose.

360
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,440
I didn't buy a knife.

361
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,520
Well, the paperwork is valid for the next six months.

362
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,200
In the meantime,

363
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,310
I hope you don't get attacked by anyone with a gun,

364
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,560
- or even a knife. - Goodbye.

365
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,060
Good luck...

366
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,120
Next. Go.

367
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,630
Next. Go.

368
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:04,880
Go.

369
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:08,550
Horrible.

370
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,970
You do that in a fight and your opponent would laugh at you.

371
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,310
Next. Casey.

372
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,360
Good.

373
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,900
Very good.

374
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,320
Hey, Casey.

375
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,700
It's Grant, your boss. From... from work.

376
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,950
So, it's been two months since you've been in to the office.

377
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,200
How are you?

378
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:19,260
I've extended your leave five weeks past

379
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,830
what I'd originally planned,

380
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,790
and your paycheck last week, you know,

381
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,270
that actually came out of my own pocket,

382
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,260
but I consider you a friend. Uh...

383
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,940
Look, I hate to be the bad guy here

384
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,890
but I'm going to need you to come in.

385
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,280
I can give you another day

386
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,680
but you have to come back to work after that.

387
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,410
Or... you know, I'm going to have to let you go,

388
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,690
and I really don't want to have to do that.

389
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,490
Look, if it were up to me,

390
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,870
I'd give you all the time you need,

391
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,320
but my bosses...

392
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:49,280
The inbox is full. Please clear your messages.

393
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,830
Who are all these new people?

394
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,210
Today's the promotion ceremony.

395
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,090
Everyone comes to the promotion ceremony.

396
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:10,930
- Even students who take the night class. - The night class?

397
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,590
Black stripes.

398
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,350
The color black represents night. As in "night class."

399
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,520
I think I'll stick with the day class.

400
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,270
Now that I think about it,

401
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,980
you're much more suited to the day class.

402
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,150
Me, on the other hand...

403
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,700
I'm getting my stripe today.

404
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:33,160
Overheard Sensei talking about it.

405
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:36,080
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

406
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:39,540
I have... I have definitely earned it.

407
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,720
Today's a special day.

408
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,620
Not only is it a day in which we recognize those of you

409
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,150
who have outgrown your belt color,

410
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,690
it is also an important anniversary.

411
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,150
Seven years ago today,

412
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:13,210
Grand Master was killed in a tragic hiking accident

413
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,820
where he was shot in the face with a gun.

414
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,410
He was mistaken for a bird by a hunter carrying a shotgun.

415
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,970
Type of gun that fires a cartridge

416
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:25,920
which scatters 10 to 20 pellets at its target.

417
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,390
Unlike our karate, which is clean and precise,

418
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:31,710
this gun was imprecise and boorish.

419
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:33,760
Rule number 11.

420
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,340
Guns are for the weak.

421
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,430
That board isn't just for children.

422
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,770
The rules apply to all of us.

423
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:01,050
Grand Master is the only person ever

424
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:03,450
to wear the rainbow belt.

425
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:08,960
It's a belt color that he created and awarded to himself.

426
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:12,380
It is the highest honor in all of karate.

427
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,310
He achieved this rank after he challenged and defeated

428
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,150
all three other grand masters in the state

429
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,760
in unarmed combat to the death.

430
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,980
He finished each fight with his signature technique.

431
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,940
A technique only he knew.

432
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,770
A technique he never even taught me.

433
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:36,110
He punched through his opponents' heads with his index finger.

434
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,530
He was the greatest man who ever lived.

435
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,290
I do not award belts.

436
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,790
My students earn them.

437
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,770
And this first belt goes to someone

438
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:58,470
who I see a little of myself in.

439
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,640
He has devoted himself to karate,

440
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,810
and he has more than earned the right to wear the color yellow.

441
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:12,190
Casey.

442
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,210
The progression from yellow belt to green belt

443
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:02,490
is one of great sacrifice and introspection.

444
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,910
It is filled with immeasurable pain, both internal and external.

445
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,590
Thank you all for coming to support each other.

446
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,810
- We are all family here... - Isn't there something else?

447
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:28,810
What was that?

448
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,900
I just wanted to make sure you weren't forgetting something.

449
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,520
What would I be forgetting, blue belt?

450
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,320
I heard there was going to be another promotion tonight.

451
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,900
- You heard that? - I did.

452
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,870
Something black.

453
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,790
"Something black."

454
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:57,550
Actually, you're correct.

455
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,380
There is something black.

456
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:09,180
Well, I was saving it till the very end for dramatic effect.

457
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,700
As I said before, today is a special day.

458
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,140
Not only because it is the unfortunate anniversary

459
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,430
of Grand Master being shot and killed while on a hike

460
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,630
after being mistaken for a bird by a hunter.

461
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:43,010
Today is the first time

462
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:46,010
that I get to promote one of my students to black belt.

463
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,970
This student has been with us from the very beginning.

464
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,020
They are unquestioning.

465
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,980
Their loyalty is unwavering.

466
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:58,980
But most importantly, they know that despite this black belt,

467
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:02,030
they will always be my student,

468
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:04,990
while I will always be their teacher.

469
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:12,870
Thomas.

470
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,850
You're in my spot, brown belt.

471
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:37,060
Black is higher than brown. Please move over to your left.

472
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,670
This concludes the ceremony.

473
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,760
As always, be sure to hold on to your old belts

474
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,300
so that if someone questions the legitimacy of your rank,

475
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,710
you can prove them wrong first with tangible evidence,

476
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,290
and then in combat.

477
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,890
Missionary. Ah, that is the best position.

478
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,490
I also like when I'm behind her

479
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,780
and she's on her hands and knees...

480
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,020
- Doggy style. - Yes, doggy style.

481
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,900
That position is also very nice.

488
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,850
All this stuff's yellow.

489
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,400
Paper, please.

490
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,240
Excuse me

491
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,080
Did you door-ding my car?

492
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,370
- I don't know. - I think you did.

493
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,460
Then why did you ask me?

494
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,260
Because I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt.

495
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,800
- Okay, then no. - No what?

496
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,760
- I don't think I did. - But you did though.

497
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:13,060
- I say I didn't. - But it doesn't work that way.

498
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:13,940
You obviously did. I saw you.

499
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,820
You can't just tell me...

500
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,640
Do you have a problem?

501
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,190
The part where you slammed your door into my car,

502
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,560
I have a problem with that. Yes.

503
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,350
- I know karate. - What belt are you?

504
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,400
Yellow belt.

505
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:27,940
Your arms are holding the grocery bag.

506
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,660
You'd have to drop the bag in order to strike me.

507
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,920
In the time it would take you to do that,

508
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,820
I would punch you in the face as hard as I can.

509
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,120
So I'm gonna ask you again. Do you have a problem?

510
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,620
You didn't slam your door into my car,

511
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:50,670
so I don't have a problem. No.

512
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,260
You? Karate? Impossible.

513
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,400
No. Bad dog.

514
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,590
I'm sorry.

515
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,250
Fuck.

516
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,530
Are you sure this board isn't meant for green belts?

517
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,950
Here, let me try.

518
00:41:58,170 --> 00:41:59,160
Okay.

519
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,250
Here, try a white belt board.

520
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,980
Your kicks and punches lacked conviction today.

521
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:30,600
Maybe I was wrong.

522
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,610
Maybe you weren't ready to be a yellow belt.

523
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:46,290
No. You're not supposed to do that.

524
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,710
You're supposed to stand up for yourself.

525
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,710
But you're right though.

526
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,210
I wasn't able to break a single board today.

527
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:55,550
And that stops you from being a yellow belt how?

528
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:00,590
If a bear's forest catches on fire, the bear is still a bear.

529
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,610
Even if a boat capsizes in rough seas

530
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:05,900
and sinks to the bottom of the ocean

531
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,060
with no survivors,

532
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,230
it is still a boat.

533
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,150
You will be a yellow belt until you die,

534
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,530
or until you're a green belt.

535
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,400
And you'll be a green belt until you're a blue belt.

536
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,660
And so on.

537
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,700
I wish I could wear my belt all the time.

538
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,750
I feel less-than without it.

539
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:36,130
Come with me.

540
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,090
I want you to tell me why you're here.

541
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,520
I... I told you before. It was my New Year's resolution.

542
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:50,770
I thought you said it was health and fitness.

543
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:53,310
That's what I meant.

544
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:56,270
Why are you really here?

545
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,410
I was mugged.

546
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,870
At night. A few months ago.

547
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:15,670
I was beaten, severely, by several men.

548
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:18,800
I'm afraid.

549
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:22,550
I'm afraid of the dark.

550
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,720
I'm afraid of other men.

551
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,060
They intimidate me.

552
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:33,690
I wanna be what intimidates me.

553
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,230
Well, you came to the right place.

554
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:40,940
You're learning karate.

555
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,950
You're a blade and I'm sharpening you.

556
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,950
But there's a mental component as well.

557
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:52,040
You mean, like, believing in myself?

558
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:55,670
Yeah. That won't hurt.

559
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,710
I'm talking about something a little different.

560
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:03,130
What's your favorite style of music?

561
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,340
Adult contemporary.

562
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:07,550
No. Should be metal.

563
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,470
Do you ever listen to metal?

564
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:13,520
You mean, like hard rock?

565
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:18,190
Metal is much more aggressive than hard rock.

566
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,900
- From now on, you'll listen to metal. - Yeah.

567
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,610
It's the toughest music there is.

568
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,700
What about hobbies?

569
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:30,030
Is there anything that you feel particularly passionate about,

570
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,870
other than your new-found passion for metal?

571
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,540
I enjoy France.

572
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,470
I mean, French things. I haven't actually been to France,

573
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:43,020
but I'm learning the language

574
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,650
and I would like to visit there someday.

575
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,090
That's not good.

576
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,400
Historically, the perception of the French

577
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,850
is that they're weak and that they surrender easily.

578
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,270
Hardly traits that you want to embrace.

579
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,640
Russia, on the other hand, is considered a tough country.

580
00:45:57,450 --> 00:46:00,790
Also, Germany. Germany is very strong and capable.

581
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:02,300
My dog's breed is German.

582
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,490
Excellent. German shepherd.

583
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:06,240
A dachshund, actually.

584
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,120
- Well, regardless, Germany it is. - Okay.

585
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,330
You must start thinking this way. Do you understand?

586
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,010
In every facet of life. What you eat.

587
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:17,540
How you interact with others.

588
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,130
What arouses you. Everything should be as masculine as possible.

589
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:31,140
As you know, I teach a night class.

590
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:36,100
This is your invitation.

591
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,700
I've never opened this class up to yellow belts before

592
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,520
but I'm gonna make an exception for you.

593
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:46,610
- What time is the class? - It's at night. It's a night class.

594
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:47,740
I don't think I can.

595
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,030
I won't make you do anything, but like the color of the belt,

596
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,370
you've earned this stripe.

597
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,870
This invitation, it will be yours forever.

598
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:03,090
Just because you ignore it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

599
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:05,800
Come here.

600
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:17,900
Not only does this class offer you more

601
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:19,240
of what I believe you're looking for

602
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:23,940
but I guarantee you it will help you become what you fear.

603
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:29,860
Casey, stop being afraid.

607
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,970
The usual? Chocolate croissant and an orange juice?

608
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:25,750
No. I've got a new usual.

609
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,210
Coffee. Hot. Black. With nothing to eat.

610
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:33,540
That's mine.

611
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,730
It's mine now. I take what I want.

612
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:37,300
I only care about myself.

615
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:53,990
Hey there, Casey.

616
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,240
- Listening to music? - I'm learning German.

617
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,460
German? That's very international of you.

618
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:06,420
You may want to start on those reports though.

619
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:08,350
That pile is getting awfully high

620
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:09,680
and I don't want you to feel obligated

621
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,420
to come in to the office over the weekend.

622
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:15,180
Hey, um, Maggie asked me if you wanted to come over for dinner.

623
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:16,430
What do you say?

624
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:20,860
Stop trying to be my friend.

625
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:23,030
Bosses cannot be friends. It doesn't work that way.

626
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:24,530
Instead of coming over to your house for dinner

627
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:25,820
with you and your wife this weekend,

628
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,910
I think I'll stay home and masturbate to the thought of your wife

629
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:29,520
wearing her bathing suit at the barbecue.

630
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:34,860
We should do push-ups.

631
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,410
Shut up. Stop talking.

632
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:37,500
What did you say?

633
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,460
You talk too much. I don't talk, I act.

634
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:41,660
I punched him in the goddamn throat. It felt amazing.

635
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,830
- Who? - Our boss, Grant.

636
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:50,670
Do you want to join us?

637
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,430
But there's just the three chairs.

638
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,510
I'll sit in your chair.

639
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:09,150
We should do push-ups.

640
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:23,910
You're a good dog and I care for you.

641
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,550
That said, I won't be petting you anymore.

642
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:30,930
I've been coddling you. This is for your own good.

644
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:51,330
Sorry.

645
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:55,400
What are you doing?

646
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,040
You're not supposed to be here. You don't have a black stripe.

647
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,910
I thought you were my friend.

648
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:05,420
A friend wouldn't say they were a day class student

649
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,660
and then go to the night class behind my back.

650
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:08,360
I didn't...

651
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:28,010
Our limbs get their strength from leverage points.

652
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,570
An elbow can only bend one way

653
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:32,780
because if it could bend more than one way it would be weaker.

654
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:36,050
But this design is also inherently flawed.

655
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:37,170
Henry, come on up to the front.

656
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:38,710
I want you to help me demonstrate something.

657
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:50,720
Watch closely.

658
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:05,780
Leverage is a weapon.

659
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:08,230
You can use it or it can be used against you.

660
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:11,750
You earned your blue belt.

661
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:13,750
I know I could never take that from you.

662
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:16,620
So I took your arm instead.

663
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:22,770
Never come back here. Not even for the day class.

664
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:33,120
Everyone, I'd like you to welcome Casey to the night class.

665
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:34,530
He's a yellow belt.

666
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:38,140
All right. Let's begin.

668
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,140
You're done for the night.

669
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:07,690
So is he.

670
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:17,750
Can you drag him off the mat?

671
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,050
Learn to love this feeling.

672
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:34,670
Your bones aching. Your chest screaming.

673
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:37,090
This is karate.

674
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:40,720
I have nothing else.

675
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:46,700
Congratulations on a great class, everyone.

676
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:47,940
Let's begin the cool-down.

677
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,420
They're all gonna cool down on the mat,

678
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:22,590
but since it's your first time,

679
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:24,510
I want you to cool down away from the others.

680
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:26,400
Come with me.

681
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,840
I know you're probably a little confused about what's happening.

682
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:50,760
Just know that every one of them out there

683
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,230
had to do this at one point.

684
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:04,280
Again, I'm sorry to make you cool down with her.

685
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:07,980
She's a woman so her hands are naturally weaker than a man's.

686
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:11,350
An after-workout sports massage works best with strong hands,

687
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:12,970
so I know this is not ideal.

688
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:16,220
A massage from a woman is still better than a self-massage.

689
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,960
Well, what are you waiting for, yellow belt?

690
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:32,680
Take off your jacket and sit in front of me.

691
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:51,710
Sorry.

692
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:54,930
I know they're not as strong as a man's.

693
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,220
So, this is the women's changing room.

694
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:03,910
It is.

695
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:06,700
It's the same as the men's in every way,

696
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,360
only it's smaller and not as nice.

697
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,620
How long have you been taking karate?

698
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,280
I was one of the Dojo's first students when it opened.

699
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,190
And how long have you been a brown belt?

700
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,190
The cool-down is supposed to be silent.

701
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,270
Why was he promoted to black belt before you?

702
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:32,550
Is that why you fought him tonight?

703
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:35,650
You could have killed him.

704
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:39,470
- It looked like you wanted to. - I was proving a point.

705
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:40,560
- About your belt? - No.

706
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:42,770
About why I'm here.

707
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,170
Never hold back.

708
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:48,320
Not ever.

709
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:52,540
It will only make you weak, and you can't be weak anymore.

710
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:53,840
Not in the night classes.

711
00:59:56,350 --> 00:59:57,300
Do you understand?

712
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:01,510
I think I do.

713
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,950
But then again, maybe I don't.

714
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:09,530
You will.

715
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:14,470
This isn't a safe place, Casey.

716
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:30,630
My turn.

717
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:37,160
You can come in.

718
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:49,030
Your belt. It's yellow.

719
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,140
I had it made.

720
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:53,040
It's for everyday use with casual clothing.

721
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:56,080
Obviously, I chose yellow because I am a yellow belt.

722
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:58,170
I wanted to wear my yellow belt all the time

723
01:00:58,170 --> 01:00:59,940
but I knew it would look strange.

724
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,020
That really is a wonderful idea.

725
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:05,900
To be honest, I wish I'd thought of it.

726
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:08,010
Now I can be a yellow belt in everyday life,

727
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:09,730
in addition to being one in this dojo.

728
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:13,210
I mentioned before that I had it made.

729
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:14,950
It was a special order.

730
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:17,670
The thing is, the belt company wouldn't make just one.

731
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,400
I had to make at least 50.

732
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:26,540
The positive out of this is

733
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:28,480
that I have enough for all the other students.

734
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,570
I even had them make a black one for you.

735
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:34,590
I think it turned out quite nice.

736
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:04,320
I don't know what to say.

737
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,080
I'm honored.

738
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:09,730
How much did all this cost?

739
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:12,650
Don't worry about that. This is my gift to the academy.

740
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:13,420
Although I was let go from

741
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:15,870
my accounting job the other day, unexpectedly.

742
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:17,640
You have accounting experience?

743
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:21,170
10 years, or 120 months.

744
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:25,090
I'm looking for someone to help manage the books here.

745
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:26,980
I can't keep up with the growth of the academy.

746
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:28,990
There's more money coming in. It's overwhelming.

747
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:31,870
I could use a mind like yours.

748
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:35,050
It wouldn't be permanent. Just till you get things on track.

749
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:38,580
Well, thank you. Yes. The answer is yes.

750
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:40,650
Good.

751
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:42,830
You'll start tomorrow.

752
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:47,050
I'm sure you'll find another job by the time you finish

753
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:48,370
organizing the books here.

754
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:50,540
- Casey. - Yes?

755
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:53,550
I really am excited about the belt.

756
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:10,300
- Hello? - Casey?

757
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:11,290
Who is this?

758
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:12,990
The men you told me about,

759
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:14,790
would you know them if you saw them?

760
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,010
Is that you, Sensei?

761
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:19,570
The men. The ones who attacked you.

762
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:21,850
- I... - Would you know their faces?

763
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:26,780
They were wearing helmets. Motorcycle helmets.

764
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:29,830
- So you didn't see their faces? - Why are you asking me this?

765
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:32,730
The other day, when you told me about what happened to you,

766
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:33,780
it made me angry.

767
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:35,770
I have resources.

768
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:38,590
I found one of the men who attacked you, Casey.

769
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:40,120
I need you to meet me.

770
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:42,400
But I won't be sure.

771
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:44,410
It was dark.

772
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:47,840
And like I was saying, they were wearing motorcycle helmets.

773
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:51,800
It's him. You have to trust me.

774
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:53,820
You trust me, don't you?

776
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:02,470
Did you park in the garage like I asked?

777
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,210
Yeah. There was a motorcycle.

778
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:06,730
I'm glad you came.

779
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,400
I see you're wearing your belt for strength.

780
01:04:12,190 --> 01:04:12,900
Me too.

781
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:16,930
Not only does it represent my black belt in karate

782
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:18,810
but it also helps keep my pants up.

783
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:21,330
Yeah. So, where is he?

784
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:25,230
In the bar.

786
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:30,370
I still don't... Are you... Are you sure it's him?

787
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:31,750
- Very sure. - But how?

788
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:34,590
How what? You saw the motorcycle with your own eyes.

789
01:04:34,590 --> 01:04:35,690
How did you find him?

790
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:38,070
You don't need to worry about that.

791
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,450
Well, what does he look like?

792
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:45,010
He wears a hat sometimes, but not always.

793
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:51,230
There he is.

794
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:54,300
- That's the man we're looking for. - Him?

795
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:57,580
Yeah. He matches the description I gave you.

796
01:04:57,790 --> 01:04:58,740
He's not wearing a hat,

797
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:00,240
but I told you he doesn't always wear one.

798
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,830
I just don't think we should do this. Not like this.

799
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:04,480
Although I do appreciate you trying to...

800
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:08,220
I'm not giving you the choice, Casey.

801
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:10,250
Out here's no different than in my dojo.

802
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:12,560
That belt that you're wearing is still yellow and mine's still black.

803
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:13,960
I'm your teacher and you're my student

804
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:14,970
and you'll do as you're told.

805
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:18,230
And understand this. I'm not helping you.

806
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:19,690
You're helping yourself.

807
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:23,240
Remember what he did to you.

808
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:27,700
He stole your dignity.

809
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:31,020
Take it back.

810
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:23,910
Do you remember me?

811
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:26,250
I don't think.

812
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:28,390
Look at me.

813
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:30,450
I'm talking to you.

814
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:33,290
Do you remember my face?

815
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,100
Good night.

816
01:06:55,070 --> 01:06:56,020
No. Don't touch him.

817
01:06:58,330 --> 01:06:59,800
Don't touch him. He's still breathing.

818
01:07:00,530 --> 01:07:01,270
What are you doing?

819
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:03,630
You taught him a lesson.

820
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:05,810
He and his friends will

821
01:07:05,810 --> 01:07:08,270
definitely think twice before messing with you again.

822
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:11,670
- Why are you filming this? - I'm documenting.

823
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:13,780
Documenting what?

824
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:15,830
Your growth.

825
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,180
See you tomorrow.

826
01:07:23,990 --> 01:07:24,730
We'll get you started with

827
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:26,280
determining which accounts are delinquent

828
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,190
and then, if we have enough time,

829
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:28,690
we'll move on to organizing the receipts

830
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:30,320
for the business-related purchases.

831
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,230
You did the right thing. You'll see.

832
01:08:39,650 --> 01:08:42,180
I'm sorry. There was nothing we could do.

833
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:46,830
Did he go peacefully?

834
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:50,230
No. It was likely very painful.

835
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:52,000
There was a great deal of trauma.

836
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:54,040
What do you mean, "Trauma"?

837
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,300
Well, the X-rays indicated there were broken ribs

838
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,680
and severe bruising to the internal tissue.

839
01:09:00,190 --> 01:09:01,200
I don't understand.

840
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:04,820
Did you hurt your dog?

841
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:07,290
Of course not. No. He was my best friend.

842
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:09,180
I left him alone in my house and when I came back...

843
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:11,140
Did you notice anything out of place?

844
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:13,560
I... I don't know. I came straight here.

845
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:15,230
Do you think someone did this to him?

846
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,010
- We found blood on his canines. - He bit them?

847
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:22,870
It seems he fought to the very end. He was very brave.

848
01:09:23,110 --> 01:09:25,020
I tried my best not to coddle him.

849
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:30,350
I know this is hard. I don't want to upset you.

850
01:09:31,070 --> 01:09:32,520
But it's the strangest thing.

851
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:35,190
He died from a punch. I'm sure of it.

852
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:37,180
Only, the bruising pattern

853
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:41,440
doesn't seem to indicate a fist but rather a foot.

854
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:45,600
I know. It doesn't make any sense.

855
01:09:50,890 --> 01:09:52,940
Sometimes your opponent will be bigger than you,

856
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:56,330
but remember this. You're children. You're still growing.

857
01:09:56,710 --> 01:09:57,910
If they defeat you in combat,

858
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,010
there will always be the opportunity later in life,

859
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:02,530
when you are fully grown, to exact your revenge.

860
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:05,010
Casey, we're in the middle of a class.

861
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,220
What are you doing?

862
01:10:15,070 --> 01:10:16,340
I'm wearing shoes on the mat.

863
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:18,930
Also, I didn't bow.

864
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:20,460
What happened?

865
01:10:21,730 --> 01:10:24,100
- What is it? You can tell me. - I'm hungry.

866
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:34,300
Don't do this.

867
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:38,880
All this not bowing and eating on the mat has made me thirsty.

868
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:48,220
Rule number nine. Stay hydrated.

869
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:51,360
- Enough. - You killed my dog!

870
01:10:55,170 --> 01:10:56,650
- When? - Last night.

871
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,370
I was with you last night.

872
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:03,290
Casey, that's impossible.

873
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:06,360
Is that the dog that you were telling me was of German lineage?

874
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:08,320
He was a dachshund, you son of a bitch.

875
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:11,150
Dachshund. Short of stature, long of body.

876
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:13,420
Not the most masculine of breeds.

877
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:16,180
No, unfortunately, I have no idea what you're talking about.

878
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,240
My condolences.

879
01:11:22,910 --> 01:11:26,180
Fuck you and fuck your dojo.

880
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:28,550
As I said already, I was with you last night.

881
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:31,310
I saw what you did to that man, that innocent man.

882
01:11:31,310 --> 01:11:32,540
You said he was one of them.

883
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:35,120
And deep down, you knew he didn't have anything to do

884
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:37,550
with whatever happened to you and yet you did what you did anyway.

885
01:11:38,230 --> 01:11:40,740
- You're insane. - It didn't matter to you, did it?

886
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:44,470
You wanted to take out your pain and frustration on someone else

887
01:11:44,470 --> 01:11:46,120
and you needed to become what you hated.

888
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,970
I'm done. This isn't karate.

889
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:50,390
I have it all on tape.

890
01:12:17,010 --> 01:12:19,010
The man from last night has two choices.

891
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:21,500
Either become a better version of himself...

892
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:23,390
or succumb to his weaknesses.

893
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:27,980
You gave him that choice, and his life will never be the same.

894
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:30,970
That night all those months ago was the best thing

895
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:32,820
that ever happened to you and you know it.

896
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:37,310
You are who you always wanted to be.

897
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:40,100
Karate has changed you.

898
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:45,780
Channel this energy into class tonight.

899
01:12:58,960 --> 01:12:59,990
And take your shoes off.

900
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:11,520
Okay, children. Back to work.

901
01:13:22,510 --> 01:13:24,670
In the art of accounting, I'm a white belt,

902
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:29,180
and you are a fiscal black belt.

903
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:34,790
- Did you kill my dog? - No.

904
01:13:36,110 --> 01:13:38,510
Even if it wasn't a masculine dog, I didn't kill it.

905
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:40,720
But I'm gonna make this right.

906
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:42,810
You'll see.

907
01:13:44,270 --> 01:13:46,740
I've been having trouble controlling my emotions lately.

908
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:47,790
I'm sorry.

909
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:59,900
It's a very masculine trait. Embrace it.

910
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:03,630
Women are much cooler-headed.

911
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,290
I want you to come work for me full-time.

912
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:10,480
This is a part-time job at best.

913
01:14:10,490 --> 01:14:12,380
I want you to take over the children's class.

914
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:15,080
- What about Anna? - Let me worry about Anna.

915
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:18,130
But she's easily the most qualified person for this position.

916
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,520
I'm just a yellow belt. She's almost a black belt.

917
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:22,050
Anna will never be a black belt.

918
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:27,140
To be honest, I didn't ever think she'd last this long.

919
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:29,790
When she earned her blue belt,

920
01:14:29,790 --> 01:14:31,440
I put her in charge of the children's class

921
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,950
due to her innate maternal instincts. She is a woman.

922
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:36,980
But she let her feminine tendencies interfere with her karate.

923
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:41,260
I realize now that her being a woman

924
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:43,620
will prevent her from ever becoming a man.

925
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:57,010
You know, there are things in life that men do

926
01:14:57,010 --> 01:15:00,450
and there are things in life that women do.

927
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,340
There are some things that women and men do together,

928
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:07,220
like ride a tandem bicycle or have sex.

929
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:11,570
But even then, men ride a tandem bicycle to please the woman

930
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:13,530
and sex is the other way around.

931
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:16,720
Karate...

932
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:20,780
Karate's a thing for men.

933
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:25,240
It's time for the night class.

934
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:34,830
I just wanted to say thank you for the belts.

935
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:38,380
Of course. Yeah. I'm so glad you like them.

936
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:40,750
Like it? I love it.

937
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:44,300
Now, while I'm walking around in public,

938
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,440
I can still feel like a brown belt

939
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:50,070
by wearing this brown belt. Thank you.

940
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:55,230
Tonight, I want you, you,

941
01:15:55,930 --> 01:16:00,160
and you.

942
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:02,930
How big is your head?

943
01:16:04,010 --> 01:16:05,410
Regular size.

944
01:16:06,290 --> 01:16:08,270
Finish getting dressed. Meet me out the back.

946
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:36,420
I don't think I can do this.

947
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:40,630
Did you hear me? I can't do this.

948
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,230
Yes, you can. You'll be fine.

949
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:44,650
- You're not coming. - I'm coming.

950
01:16:44,650 --> 01:16:46,950
- We don't need you. - Casey can take my place as runner.

951
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:48,140
I'll be the driver this time.

952
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:50,060
Otherwise you'll only have three drivers and one runner.

953
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:52,030
You need the extra runner and you know it.

954
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:00,710
Put it on. Do it.

955
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:31,170
I want you two to play spotters.

956
01:17:31,170 --> 01:17:32,180
We'll do it.

957
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:34,070
No.

958
01:17:34,570 --> 01:17:36,710
You're lucky I even let you ride with us tonight.

959
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:38,050
Thomas is too recognizable.

960
01:17:38,050 --> 01:17:39,730
You can see his disgusting face and bandages

961
01:17:39,730 --> 01:17:41,160
even with the helmet on.

962
01:17:41,310 --> 01:17:43,950
Casey has to do it. He needs to prove himself.

963
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:49,350
It's time, Casey. Go find us someone to help.

964
01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:51,730
They have to be alone.

965
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,830
You should have never started taking karate, Casey.

966
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:05,580
- But you did. - We don't have to do this.

967
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:07,220
He'll kill us if we don't.

968
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,620
Everything's gonna be okay,

969
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:23,660
but one of us has to hurt him, Casey.

970
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:24,850
I can't.

971
01:18:26,230 --> 01:18:27,740
Then wait here.

972
01:18:31,390 --> 01:18:32,370
Who are you?

973
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,250
Stop!

974
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:39,970
Police! Stop! Show me your hands! Police!

975
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:42,440
Shit.

976
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:45,210
I didn't mean to shoot your friend. Please, stop.

977
01:18:45,210 --> 01:18:47,320
Stop where you are! Show me your hands!

978
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:49,100
It was an accident.

979
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,280
Casey!

980
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:15,000
Casey!

981
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:20,850
Casey! Casey, we have to leave now!

982
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:10,970
They got our guy. He's dead. They got away.

983
01:20:12,110 --> 01:20:13,870
You know, one of the jobs of the spotter

984
01:20:13,870 --> 01:20:16,200
is to ask the person if they have a gun.

985
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:18,940
And that man had a gun. Why didn't you ask if he had a gun?

986
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:21,650
My kicks aren't gonna be so strong anymore.

987
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,760
The bullet only grazed you.

988
01:20:25,150 --> 01:20:26,960
Imprecise and boorish.

989
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:28,850
Hey, this is your fault.

990
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:31,700
Remind me to put a red stripe on your belt tomorrow.

991
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,720
What? The stripe for instructors? You... you can keep that.

992
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:38,150
Red stripes aren't for instructors. It's for ending a life.

993
01:20:38,150 --> 01:20:41,470
Red represents blood. There's no stripe for instructors.

994
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:45,190
A yellow belt with both black and red stripes...

995
01:20:46,290 --> 01:20:47,770
unprecedented.

996
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:51,330
- Thomas, take Anna home. - No.

997
01:20:52,150 --> 01:20:53,190
I'll do it.

998
01:20:57,610 --> 01:20:59,950
So, how did you get yours?

999
01:20:59,950 --> 01:21:01,610
This one on the right.

1000
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:08,140
My what?

1001
01:21:10,190 --> 01:21:13,010
Your stripe. The red one.

1002
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:18,100
It was another student.

1003
01:21:20,570 --> 01:21:21,810
He was a belt above me.

1004
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:24,570
The highest ranked at the time, other than Sensei.

1005
01:21:24,910 --> 01:21:26,580
I was better than him.

1006
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:31,030
I knew it, but I also knew my place.

1007
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,190
And during the sparring sessions,

1008
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:35,120
I let him win 'cause I didn't want to upset the hierarchy.

1009
01:21:35,210 --> 01:21:38,190
As you've probably noticed, there's a hierarchy in karate.

1010
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:42,950
At this point, the dojo only had one changing room,

1011
01:21:43,810 --> 01:21:46,340
so I would wait until the men finished changing,

1012
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:48,050
then I would get dressed alone.

1013
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:51,660
And one night, as I was getting undressed,

1014
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:54,840
the upper belt came in and attacked me from behind.

1015
01:21:56,450 --> 01:21:58,050
I'd always held back in class,

1016
01:21:58,050 --> 01:22:01,010
so he saw me as weak.

1017
01:22:02,510 --> 01:22:04,200
An easy target.

1018
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:09,710
I ended up strangling him to death with his own belt.

1019
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:13,300
I made him suffer.

1020
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:18,330
And the last thing he saw before his eyes burst was

1021
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:21,100
the sense of satisfaction on my face.

1022
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:25,160
He saw that I was not weak,

1023
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,550
but strong.

1024
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:31,570
I've never held anything back since.

1025
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:35,460
After that, Sensei had the old equipment closet

1026
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:37,580
converted into the women's changing room.

1027
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:40,940
He said that I had tempted the upper belt.

1028
01:22:41,950 --> 01:22:43,470
That it was my fault.

1029
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:49,770
But it wasn't your fault.

1030
01:22:51,330 --> 01:22:52,400
I know.

1031
01:23:00,110 --> 01:23:01,720
Thanks for the ride.

1032
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:05,920
I hope I never see you in class again, Casey.

1033
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:09,000
I hope you leave and never come back. I really do.

1041
01:27:42,270 --> 01:27:43,570
You're gonna kill him.

1042
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:46,790
He's trying to kill him.

1043
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,640
You think you're the only one that deserves a red stripe?

1044
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:53,110
I deserve a red stripe just as much as you. Maybe more.

1045
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,600
He looks very weak and hopeless.

1046
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:58,850
Chances of him making something of his life are minimal.

1047
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:01,930
- Go ahead. - Wait.

1048
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:03,830
Do you hear that?

1049
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:05,830
Sirens.

1050
01:28:06,940 --> 01:28:08,340
I hear sirens.

1051
01:28:08,490 --> 01:28:09,740
I don't hear anything.

1052
01:28:10,070 --> 01:28:12,550
Women are much more sensitive to higher-pitched sounds than men.

1053
01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:15,040
Trust me. I hear sirens approaching. We should leave.

1054
01:28:17,490 --> 01:28:18,790
Take his wallet.

1057
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:29,690
I'm going to kill you.

1058
01:31:31,780 --> 01:31:33,430
Do you want to know why?

1059
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:39,630
I could say it's for the honor of the dojo.

1060
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:44,070
I could tell you it's because you're blackmailing former students

1061
01:31:44,070 --> 01:31:47,340
into paying membership fees long after they leave.

1062
01:31:48,730 --> 01:31:50,980
Or because private lessons

1063
01:31:51,260 --> 01:31:53,870
are given to those who do not ask for them.

1064
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:55,980
Like myself.

1065
01:31:58,040 --> 01:32:00,860
But really it's because I hate you.

1066
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:04,970
I hate you very much.

1067
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:08,740
And not only do I want to watch you die,

1068
01:32:08,910 --> 01:32:11,990
but I want to be the reason that you stop breathing.

1069
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:16,890
I've never wanted anything more in my entire life.

1070
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:21,580
I'm going to kill you, Leslie.

1071
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:27,490
That's right.

1072
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:30,720
I found out that your real name is Leslie.

1073
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:33,630
I called you that to make you angry.

1074
01:32:34,490 --> 01:32:35,870
When you think about it,

1075
01:32:35,870 --> 01:32:39,600
Leslie is a lot more feminine-sounding than Casey.

1076
01:32:41,990 --> 01:32:43,680
I can make you a black belt.

1077
01:32:43,970 --> 01:32:45,570
You can skip all the other colors.

1078
01:32:45,570 --> 01:32:47,100
You don't even need to earn it.

1079
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:54,430
I challenge you to a fight to the death, in unarmed combat.

1080
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:57,700
You'll lose.

1081
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:01,580
I'm better at fighting than you.

1082
01:33:09,970 --> 01:33:11,030
Very well.

1083
01:33:13,130 --> 01:33:14,310
I accept.

1084
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:48,470
I've been thinking a lot lately,

1085
01:34:48,870 --> 01:34:51,470
about what I would say to you after I killed you.

1086
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:54,930
I came up with two things,

1087
01:34:55,230 --> 01:34:57,680
and I don't want to second-guess my choice later on,

1088
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:59,560
so I'm going to say both.

1089
01:35:00,610 --> 01:35:05,910
First, you would say that using this makes me a weak man,

1090
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:08,050
and without question, it does.

1091
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:11,450
But I am alive and you are dead,

1092
01:35:11,450 --> 01:35:14,620
so I would argue it makes you the weaker man.

1093
01:35:17,140 --> 01:35:20,700
The second thing I came up with is from a film I saw once.

1094
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:24,060
I didn't play by the rules,

1095
01:35:24,650 --> 01:35:27,290
but there never were any rules.

1096
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:42,570
I defeated him in unarmed combat to the death.

1097
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:45,020
In the tradition of our Grand Master,

1098
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:48,290
I punched a hole through his head with my index finger.

1099
01:35:48,570 --> 01:35:53,110
It was a move that only Grand Master knew but now I know it too.

1100
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:55,870
I did it to restore honor to Grand Master,

1101
01:35:55,870 --> 01:35:57,970
this academy and its students.

1102
01:35:57,970 --> 01:35:59,660
Does anybody have a problem with that?

1103
01:35:59,660 --> 01:36:01,150
Because if you do, I'm happy

1104
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:03,530
to punch my finger through your skull too.

1105
01:36:08,190 --> 01:36:11,220
Good. I've killed enough people for today.

1106
01:36:12,190 --> 01:36:15,380
On second thought, there is one more thing.

1107
01:36:15,700 --> 01:36:18,130
Everyone hold their hands out in front of them.

1108
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:22,900
Don't make me ask again.

1109
01:36:48,570 --> 01:36:49,800
What's this for?

1110
01:36:51,690 --> 01:36:53,430
I sprained my wrist.

1111
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:57,480
- How did you sprain it? - Playing guitar.

1112
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,630
- I didn't know you played. - I do.

1113
01:37:00,970 --> 01:37:02,710
How are you with chords and scales?

1114
01:37:02,710 --> 01:37:05,980
I'm good with them. I can play several songs quite well.

1115
01:37:06,610 --> 01:37:09,510
What type of music were you playing when you sprained your wrist?

1116
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:10,750
Soft rock.

1117
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:14,320
- Take off the bandage. - Why?

1118
01:37:14,590 --> 01:37:17,720
Because it is impossible to sprain your wrist playing soft rock.

1119
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:20,320
Only extreme metal can do that.

1123
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:41,680
This is my new dog.

1124
01:37:41,690 --> 01:37:43,550
We've come to an understanding.

1125
01:37:43,550 --> 01:37:45,500
He knows that I'm the alpha.

1128
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:04,900
This is not mine.

1129
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:10,640
I took it, but I did not earn it.

1130
01:38:46,750 --> 01:38:48,660
Now get in line, yellow belt.

1131
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:04,230
Up until this point,

1132
01:39:04,230 --> 01:39:06,500
you've been taught that violence equals strength

1133
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:08,640
and compassion equals weakness.

1134
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:11,080
This ideology is limiting.

1135
01:39:11,090 --> 01:39:15,690
It is possible to be brutally tolerant or peacefully savage.

1136
01:39:15,730 --> 01:39:16,870
Your karate mindset is

1137
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:19,580
equally as important as your karate skill set.

1138
01:39:21,190 --> 01:39:23,170
You're gonna notice some changes around here,

1139
01:39:23,170 --> 01:39:27,720
but this is still the night class and you are still its students.

1140
01:39:28,190 --> 01:39:29,560
Do you understand?

1141
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:33,370
Good.

1142
01:39:34,550 --> 01:39:36,680
Let's start with some moderate stretching.

1144
01:39:47,410 --> 01:39:50,280
All right, students. Let's start with some warm-ups.

1145
01:39:50,650 --> 01:39:52,040
Jumping jacks.

1146
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:57,660
One, two, three, four, five, six...

1147
01:39:57,660 --> 01:40:02,170
- Very good. - seven, eight, nine, 10.

1148
01:40:02,170 --> 01:40:06,110
Good. Everybody, well done. Now let's do your side kicks.

1149
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:20,050
Very good side kicks. Excellent form.

1150
01:40:20,370 --> 01:40:23,770
Okay, everybody. Now we're doing karate chops.

1151
01:40:23,780 --> 01:40:24,380
Ready?

1152
01:40:30,260 --> 01:40:31,780
Very good chops.

1153
01:40:34,870 --> 01:40:37,780
Great job, Manny. You've made great strides.

1154
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:39,040
All right, everybody.

1155
01:40:39,050 --> 01:40:41,620
Now I'm going to teach you how to kick with your fist,

1156
01:40:41,620 --> 01:40:43,510
and punch with your foot.

1157
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:44,650
Are you ready?
