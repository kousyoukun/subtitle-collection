00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:31,687
THE SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE

1
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,532
"Once upon a time..."

2
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:58,907
"Somewhere on the Castilian plain,
around 1940..."

3
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:24,905
<i>The movie's coming!</i>
<i>The movie's coming!</i>

4
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,692
You boys are gonna fall.

5
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,994
How are you?

6
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,837
What are you doing?
Get out of here!

7
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,708
Look at all the cans of film!

8
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,719
Let me through.

9
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,994
- What's the movie about?
- The movie?

10
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,398
It's wonderful.

11
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,368
Is it a horror movie?

12
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:28,871
Is that all?

13
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:30,804
Is it a cowboy movie?

14
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,510
It's a beautiful movie.

15
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,270
Are there Indians in it?

16
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,211
It's tremendous!
The best I've ever shown in this town.

17
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,876
You can't even imagine.

18
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:43,315
All I can say is: Olé!

19
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:50,227
This evening, in the town hall,

20
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,364
at 5:00

21
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:57,025
there'll be a special showing

22
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,172
of <i>Frankenstein.</i>

23
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,534
Ticket prices will be

24
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:06,109
one peseta for adults

25
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,780
and two reales for children.

26
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,472
How's it going, Tomasa?

27
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,612
I hope it's good this time.

28
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:47,183
It's magnificent.

29
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,548
Don't start a fire, now.

30
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,986
Careful with that brazier.

31
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:51,244
<i>The film's producers</i>
<i>do not wish to present it</i>

32
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:54,284
<i>without a preliminary</i>
<i>word of caution.</i>

33
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,885
<i>This is the story</i>
<i>of Dr. Frankenstein,</i>

34
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,354
<i>a man of science</i>

35
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,790
<i>who sought to create a living being,</i>

36
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:06,692
<i>without recognizing that</i>
<i>that's something only God can do.</i>

37
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,802
<i>It's one of the strangest stories</i>
<i>ever told.</i>

38
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,973
<i>It's about the great mysteries</i>
<i>of creation:</i>

39
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,471
<i>Life and death.</i>

40
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,846
<i>Prepare yourselves.</i>

41
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,777
<i>You may be shocked,</i>

42
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:27,111
<i>or even horrified.</i>

43
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,779
<i>Few films have had</i>
<i>greater impact all over the world.</i>

44
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,519
<i>But I would advise you</i>

45
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,753
<i>not to take it too seriously.</i>

46
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:46,725
<i>Though nothing can bring back</i>
<i>the happy moments we spent together,</i>

47
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,131
<i>I pray that God grant me</i>
<i>the joy of seeing you again.</i>

48
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,963
<i>That's been my constant prayer</i>

49
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,971
<i>ever since we parted</i>
<i>during the war,</i>

50
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:01,280
<i>and it's my prayer still</i>
<i>here in this remote spot</i>

51
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:05,611
<i>where Fernando and the girls</i>
<i>and I try to survive.</i>

52
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:12,423
<i>Little but the walls are left</i>
<i>of the house you once knew.</i>

53
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:17,829
<i>I often wonder what became</i>
<i>of everything we had there.</i>

54
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,490
<i>I don't say that out of nostalgia.</i>

55
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,829
<i>It's hard to feel nostalgic</i>

56
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:27,472
<i>after what we've been through</i>
<i>these past few years.</i>

57
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,568
<i>But sometimes,</i>
<i>when I look around me</i>

58
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:34,143
<i>and see so much loss,</i>

59
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:38,181
<i>so much destruction</i>
<i>and so much sadness,</i>

60
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:42,279
<i>something tells me</i>
<i>perhaps our ability to really feel life</i>

61
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:45,548
<i>has vanished</i>
<i>along with all the rest.</i>

62
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,788
<i>I don't even know</i>
<i>if this letter will reach you.</i>

63
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,029
<i>The news we get from outside</i>

64
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:57,168
<i>is so scant and confusing.</i>

65
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,870
<i>Please write soon</i>

66
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,666
<i>to let me know you're still alive.</i>

67
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:07,078
<i>With all my love, Teresa.</i>

68
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,583
<i>Sit down.</i>

69
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,816
<i>Sit down.</i>

70
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,224
<i>See that?</i>
<i>He understands!</i>

71
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:51,635
<i>Look at that!</i>

72
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:08,704
Teresa.

73
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,959
Milagros.

74
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,165
Have you seen my wife?

75
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,738
I think she went out a while ago.

76
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:40,105
- Where are the girls?
- At the movie.

77
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,403
Is there anything to eat
in the house?

78
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,105
I'm sure there is.

79
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,716
But you should eat regular meals

80
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,944
and come down out of the clouds.

81
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,810
<i>Sit down, Doctor.</i>

82
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,382
<i>Try to be patient.</i>

83
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,647
<i>Did you expect immediate results?</i>

84
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,847
<i>You must keep a close eye</i>
<i>on your creature.</i>

85
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:01,220
<i>Listen to me.</i>
<i>It could be dangerous.</i>

86
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:05,627
<i>Dangerous?</i>
<i>You surprise me.</i>

87
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,729
<i>Haven't you ever wanted</i>
<i>to take a chance?</i>

88
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:17,239
<i>What if we never went beyond</i>
<i>the limits of the known?</i>

89
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:21,337
<i>Have you never wished to see</i>
<i>beyond the clouds and stars?</i>

90
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:24,343
<i>Or to know</i>
<i>what makes trees grow</i>

91
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,677
<i>and changes shadows to light?</i>

92
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:33,920
<i>But speak like this</i>
<i>and they call you a madman.</i>

93
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:40,226
<i>Yet if I could answer</i>
<i>just one of these questions... - </i>

94
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:43,228
<i>what eternity is, for example... - </i>

95
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:47,565
<i>I wouldn't care</i>
<i>if they called me mad.</i>

96
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:51,436
<i>You're young,</i>
<i>dazed by your success.</i>

97
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,544
<i>Wake up and see reality.</i>

98
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,877
<i>A demon whose brain... - </i>

99
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,984
<i>You must give it time to develop.</i>

100
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,347
<i>It's a perfect brain, Doctor.</i>

101
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:07,619
<i>I can tell you this now:</i>
<i>It came from your laboratory.</i>

102
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,195
<i>The brain stolen</i>
<i>from my laboratory</i>

103
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,160
<i>belonged to a criminal!</i>

104
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:17,599
<i>- Will you be long, Papa?</i>
<i>- No, I'll just fix the wall.</i>

105
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:21,806
<i>Why don't you stay</i>
<i>and play with me?</i>

106
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:24,407
<i>I have things to do, child.</i>

107
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,244
<i>Play with your kitten.</i>

108
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,646
<i>- Good-bye, Papa.</i>
<i>- Good-bye.</i>

109
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,946
<i>And be good.</i>

110
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,311
<i>Who are you?</i>

111
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,318
<i>I'm María.</i>

112
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,754
<i>Will you play with me?</i>

113
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:28,171
<i>Would you like</i>
<i>one of my flowers?</i>

114
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,629
<i>This one's for you</i>
<i>and this one's for me.</i>

115
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,633
<i>It's like a boat.</i>

116
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:05,573
<i>See how they float?</i>

117
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:30,499
<i>Get ready, María.</i>

118
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,431
<i>I'll check the roof</i>

119
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,539
<i>and then we'll go to the village.</i>

120
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,113
Isabel.

121
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,353
Why did he kill her?

122
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:40,001
Why did he kill her?

123
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,229
<i>Silence!</i>

124
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,903
I'll tell you later.

125
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,985
It's Frankenstein!

126
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:07,665
<i>By the sign of the holy cross</i>

127
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:11,825
<i>free us from our enemies,</i>

128
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,062
<i>Lord our God.</i>

129
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:20,578
<i>In the name of the Father, the Son</i>
<i>and the Holy Spirit, amen.</i>

130
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:25,012
<i>Where did you hide the matches?</i>

131
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:27,843
<i>In the drawer.</i>

132
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,678
What?

133
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,910
Tell me
what you were going to tell me.

134
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,710
- About what?
- The movie.

135
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:03,653
Not now. Tomorrow.

136
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:06,756
Now. You promised.

137
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,757
Why did he kill the girl,

138
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:13,522
and why did they kill him after that?

139
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:21,563
You don't know.
You're a liar.

140
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:26,066
They didn't kill him,
and he didn't kill the girl.

141
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:29,140
How do you know?

142
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,010
How do you know they didn't die?

143
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:35,085
Everything in the movies is fake.

144
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,879
It's all a trick.

145
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:42,252
Besides, I've seen him alive.

146
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,025
Where?

147
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:48,063
In a place I know near the village.

148
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,863
People can't see him.

149
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,698
He only comes out at night.

150
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:00,041
Is he a ghost?

151
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,180
No, he's a spirit.

152
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:06,750
Like the spirit Doña Lucía
talks about?

153
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:13,047
Yes, but spirits don't have bodies.

154
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,292
That's why you can't kill them.

155
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,863
But he had one in the movie.

156
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:24,627
He had arms and feet.

157
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:26,736
He had everything.

158
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:31,733
It's a disguise they put on
when they go outside.

159
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:41,446
If he only comes out at night,
how can you talk to him?

160
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:46,219
I told you he was a spirit.

161
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,450
If you're his friend,

162
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:52,528
you can talk to him
whenever you want.

163
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,824
Just close your eyes

164
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,467
and call him.

165
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,699
"It's me, Ana."

166
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,067
"It's me, Ana."

167
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:47,898
"<i>Someone to whom I recently</i>

169

177

178

181

183

190
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,783
All right.
Put away your things.

191
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:07,882
Quiet!

192
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,357
Quiet!

193
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:20,301
Or else Don José will get angry.

194
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:36,447
Good morning, Don José.

195
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:41,316
Poor Don José!

196
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,351
Who left him like that?

197
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:46,026
You did, teacher!

198
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,959
Let's see, Paulita.

199
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,293
What is Don José missing?

200
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:53,061
- His heart.
- Good. Put it on him.

201
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:02,813
Mari Carmen,

202
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:05,274
what's the heart for?

203
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,545
For breathing.

204
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:16,983
All you smarty-pants
laughing so hard,

205
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:18,890
what do we breathe with?

206
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:20,997
The lungs.

207
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:23,030
Show them to us.

208
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,337
Put his lungs on.

209
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,537
Put them on him.

210
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,983
Very good.

211
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,578
What is the stomach for?

212
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:46,222
To put food in.

213
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:47,721
Put it on him.

214
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,131
Very good. Sit down.

215
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,960
Now pay attention.

216
00:33:57,168 --> 00:34:00,797
Don José can walk.
He can breathe.

217
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:02,529
He can eat.

218
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:04,640
But...

219
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:12,476
there's still something
very, very important

220
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:14,150
that's missing.

221
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,712
His bones.

222
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:18,919
His ears.

223
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:19,957
Ana.

224
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,350
You're very quiet.

225
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:25,585
What is Don José still missing?

226
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:29,597
His eyes.

227
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,063
Quiet, Isabel.

228
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,362
Answer when I ask you.

229
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,331
- His eyes.
- Very good.

230
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:39,166
Come and put them on him.

231
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:02,124
Now Don José can see.

232
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:06,059
See the house with the well?

233
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,602
- Does he live there?
- Yes.

234
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,099
You want to go there?

235
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,007
All right.

236
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:38,820
Isabel!

237
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:29,324
<i>Mama asked about you</i>
<i>this afternoon.</i>

238
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:35,331
<i>She wanted to know</i>
<i>where you were.</i>

239
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:43,095
<i>I said you were still at school.</i>

240
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:49,076
<i>Did you go to the well?</i>

241
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,646
<i>Yes.</i>

242
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,111
<i>Did you see him?</i>

243
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,484
<i>Because he doesn't know you.</i>

244
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,452
<i>Papa's coming!</i>

245
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:06,686
<i>Papa's coming!</i>

246
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,245
Papa, here's one.

247
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:53,199
- Papa, here's another one.
- I'm coming.

248
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,972
It's bad.

249
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,342
How much you wanna bet?

250
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,108
Don't touch it.

251
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:08,017
- It's good, isn't it?
- Let's see.

252
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:15,528
Yes, sir,
that's a good mushroom.

253
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:17,132
See?

254
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:20,464
Who knows what it's called?

255
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:23,637
- A brittlegill.
- A flyswatter.

256
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:26,674
No, flyswatters are poisonous.

257
00:42:29,513 --> 00:42:30,741
Look closely.

258
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,116
Trum...
- Trumpet!

259
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:35,216
Very good.

260
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,448
You can tell
by the brown color

261
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,183
and these wavy edges.

262
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:48,957
Papa, have you ever picked
a poisonous mushroom?

263
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:51,293
- No. You know why?
- Why?

264
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:54,164
Because I always do
like my grandfather told me.

265
00:42:57,641 --> 00:43:01,133
If you're not sure
a mushroom's good, don't pick it.

266
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:05,647
Because if it's bad
and you eat it,

267
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:10,081
it's your last mushroom,
and your last everything else too.

268
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:12,617
You two understand?
- I do.

269
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:16,752
Grandfather wasn't crazy
about eating them.

270
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:19,492
What he liked
was looking for them,

271
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:22,359
even if it meant a full day's hike.

272
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:24,534
He never got tired.

273
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:27,133
See that mountain?

274
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:31,139
What he called
"the mushroom garden" is up there.

275
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,005
You know why?
- Why?

276
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:37,180
Because the best mushroom
grows there... - the chanterelle.

277
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:40,607
- Why don't we go?
- It's too far.

278
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:43,853
We'd never make it
with you two weaklings.

279
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:45,851
We'll go some other day.

280
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:48,422
But first you have to promise

281
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:51,124
never to tell your mother.

282
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:12,842
Look what we have here.

283
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:16,777
A real devil.

284
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,746
It smells so good.

285
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:21,424
Sure, the young ones fool you,

286
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:24,150
but the older ones
are a different story.

287
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:26,759
Look very closely.

288
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:30,389
Look at the color of the cap

289
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:34,162
and the black gills.

290
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:38,370
Never forget, girls:
This is the worst of all.

291
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:40,566
The most poisonous.

292
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:45,411
Whoever eats this hasn't got
a chance in the world.

293
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,180
Fernando.

294
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:22,885
See you later.

295
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:34,090
- Good morning, Don Fernando.
- Good morning.

296
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:36,027
We're getting a late start.

297
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,778
<i>- You hit me!</i>
<i>- I did not!</i>

298
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:36,982
That's enough!
Stop being so boisterous.

299
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,760
- Dummy!
- Pig!

300
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:44,433
Good Lord!

301
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,125
What's all this ruckus?

302
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:48,167
- She started it.
- That's enough!

303
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:49,999
She's lying.

304
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:53,335
Come on.
It's time to wash up for school.

305
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:56,477
First you get the brush wet.

306
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:58,913
Okay.

307
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:01,510
Then you rub it
all over your face.

308
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:10,556
Then you get it soapy.

309
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:16,292
Now you rub it on your face.

310
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,942
Okay.

311
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,942
Now I shave off the little hairs?

312
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:33,844
Yes, and then you put on
some cologne.

313
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,152
Mama, do you know
what a spirit is?

314
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:52,263
You don't know and I do.

315
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,129
A spirit is a spirit.

316
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,670
Are they good or bad?

317
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,105
With good little girls,
they're very good,

318
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:03,211
but with bad girls,
they're very bad.

319
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,847
But you're always a good girl,
aren't you?

320
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:10,185
Give me a kiss.

321
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,939
It's coming!

322
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,453
"Now neither malice nor hatred,

323
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,459
nor even the fear of change.

324
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,222
I only feel thirst,

325
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:05,026
a thirst for I know not what.

326
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:08,370
Rivers of life,
where have you gone?

327
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:10,699
Air, I need air.

328
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:15,435
What do you see in the darkness
that makes you silently tremble?

329
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:18,044
I see not
but only stare like a blind man

330
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:20,212
facing straight into the sun.

331
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:24,816
I shall fall
where the fallen never rise."

332
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:11,959
"To... my...

333
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:13,823
dear...

334
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:17,696
misanthrope."

335
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:31,367
Come here.

336
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:46,933
What's wrong with you?

337
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:07,470
Come on, get up.
Stop playing around.

338
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:20,613
He's not here anymore.
He's gone.

339
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:06,391
Isabel, tell me what happened.

340
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:56,406
Milagros!

341
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,466
- Careful, you'll get burnt.
- Isabel!

342
01:04:40,676 --> 01:04:42,371
Careful, Raquel.

343
01:05:58,254 --> 01:06:00,188
What are you doing here, child?

344
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:03,389
Come on, let's go.

345
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:07,691
Let's go home.
Your father's back.

346
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:11,823
Let's go.

347
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:14,659
Come on, let's go.

348
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:54,846
Where were you?

349
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:07,365
Where were you?

350
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:21,709
Here.

351
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:31,159
Hello.

352
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:34,325
<i>Come in.</i>

353
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:42,372
<i>- May I, sir?</i>
- Come in.

354
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:46,637
- He's here.
- I'll be right there.

355
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:09,421
Ana, come here!

356
01:27:57,372 --> 01:27:59,499
Get back!

357
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:12,518
Ana, what happened to you?

358
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:42,074
- Miguel, how is she?
- Fine. Still a little weak.

359
01:28:42,617 --> 01:28:45,745
She hardly sleeps.
She won't eat or speak.

360
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:47,783
Light bothers her.

361
01:28:48,756 --> 01:28:51,919
She looks our way
but doesn't recognize us.

362
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:55,388
It's as if we didn't exist.

363
01:29:05,106 --> 01:29:08,872
Ana is still a very small child.

364
01:29:09,377 --> 01:29:12,972
She's under the effect
of a powerful experience.

365
01:29:13,648 --> 01:29:15,445
But she'll get over it.

366
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:19,650
Really, Miguel?

367
01:29:21,122 --> 01:29:25,058
Bit by bit
she'll begin to forget.

368
01:29:28,396 --> 01:29:31,627
The important thing is
that your daughter's alive.

369
01:29:31,933 --> 01:29:33,628
She's alive.

370
01:29:44,512 --> 01:29:45,877
She's gone to sleep.

371
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:48,071
Don Miguel, she's asleep.

372
01:29:48,282 --> 01:29:50,773
Give her this medicine.
The dose is right here.

373
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:53,954
Yes, sir.
I'll go right to the pharmacy.

374
01:29:55,857 --> 01:29:59,054
She should eat.
Something easy to digest.

375
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:01,387
Soup without too much fat,

376
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:03,955
a boiled egg.

377
01:30:06,167 --> 01:30:09,159
And you need rest too, Teresa,

378
01:30:09,370 --> 01:30:11,531
as much as she does.

379
01:30:12,673 --> 01:30:17,076
If anything happens, send Milagros
for me. I'll come right away.

380
01:30:17,278 --> 01:30:18,836
Yes, Miguel.

381
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:25,472
<i>Someone to whom I recently</i>
<i>showed my glass beehive,</i>

382
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:30,209
<i>with its movement like</i>
<i>the main gear wheel of a clock... - </i>

383
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:35,238
<i>Someone who saw the constant</i>
<i>agitation of the honeycomb,</i>

384
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:39,242
<i>the mysterious,</i>
<i>maddened commotion</i>

385
01:32:39,453 --> 01:32:42,286
<i>of the nurse bees</i>
<i>over the nests,</i>

386
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:46,326
<i>the teeming bridges</i>
<i>and stairways of wax,</i>

387
01:32:47,295 --> 01:32:49,923
<i>the invading spirals...</i>

388
01:35:35,296 --> 01:35:37,196
<i>If you're his friend,</i>

389
01:35:37,398 --> 01:35:41,198
<i>you can talk to him</i>
<i>whenever you want.</i>

390
01:35:41,469 --> 01:35:43,562
<i>Just close your eyes</i>

391
01:35:43,771 --> 01:35:46,239
<i>and call him.</i>

392
01:35:47,808 --> 01:35:49,639
"<i>It's me, Ana."</i>

393
01:35:53,481 --> 01:35:55,210
"<i>It's me, Ana."</i>
