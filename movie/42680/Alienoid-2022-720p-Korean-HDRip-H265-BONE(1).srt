1
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,640
For a long, long time,

2
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,490
aliens have kept their criminals locked up in human bodies.

3
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,600
But humans were unaware.

4
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,910
The aliens that could enter and exit humans at will

5
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:25,020
were called Paro.

6
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,270
Up there!

7
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,350
Kill it!

8
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:44,640
Over there!

9
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,640
The heavens have opened...

10
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:34,390
Case number 78247 - 268 trillion years have elapsed since awakening.

11
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,850
There have been human casualties.

12
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,250
We have to catch the prisoner before they escape into another body.

13
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,380
Track its location.

14
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:47,530
Prisoner is on the move. 35 meters.

15
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,980
30 meters.

16
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,580
Prisoner is approaching.

17
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,200
Don't worry.

18
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,070
I am unharmed.

19
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,640
I wasn't asking.

20
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,900
It's returning to its body!

21
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,240
Commencing extraction.

22
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,490
We'll keep coming.

23
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,760
I'm not the last one.

24
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,600
You guard bastards-

25
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,360
You're done for.

26
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,470
Mission complete.

27
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,570
Return to base.

28
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,650
My baby... please save her...

29
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,130
Oh!

30
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,130
A baby!

31
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,930
We don't get involved in human affairs.

32
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,290
I've heard that. 'I'm sorry, but we don't get involved.'

33
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,130
Hang on.

34
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,460
I have to shoot it!

35
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,980
Did you say shoot? A baby?

36
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,380
No!

37
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,860
This human bastard...

38
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,220
Criminal contained.

39
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,050
Wait, we're not taking the baby? It could die!

40
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,330
No interference. Can't you understand that?

41
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,250
No, c'mon.

42
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,660
Don't we want a baby?

43
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,910
Why do you do this every time?

44
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,460
Why?

45
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,240
Scared it'll take after me?

46
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,480
Wait a minute.

47
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,230
The baby... in the future...

48
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,540
Don't tell me she's in one of your visions.

49
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,900
Let's go. The door is closing.

50
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,960
Then I guess we've got to get back.

51
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,840
What can you do?

52
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,250
Why are you sitting back there?

53
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,760
Ah, I'm too tall like this, right?

54
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:37,660
Now departing!

55
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:08,190
These alien prisoners have existed across time and across space,

56
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,110
and it was Guard and Thunder's job to manage them.

57
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,880
So far, there have been seven escaped Paro,

58
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,020
and seven successful recontainments.

59
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,570
But that day was a little different.

60
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,530
What?

61
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,020
What is this?

62
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,520
Right? Why would there be a baby here?

63
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,480
I said, what is this?

64
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,300
The most important thing is that- That-

65
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,670
See, the thing is- Is-

66
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,140
It's-

67
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:57,740
Where do you think you're going?

68
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,140
No, I'm not-

69
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,390
Why would I be going anywhere?

70
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,340
Why did you bring it here?

71
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,760
Looks like we'll have to put it back.

72
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,940
Or... should we kill it?

73
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,850
Kill it? Why didn't you just leave it?

74
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,770
Ah, why have I done this?

75
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,490
Aha.

76
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,600
I propose an experiment!

77
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,440
Wouldn't it be so wild if we examined its brain...

78
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,870
and learned more about humans?

79
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,130
So then...

80
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,470
First, we should...

81
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:25,950
First? What?

82
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,670
... bring it into the house?

83
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,120
Me?

84
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,130
Yep!

85
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,030
What do these things eat?

86
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,690
Infant humans drink milk produced by their mothers.

87
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,810
Primary ingredient is lactose lipoprotein. Substitute formulas are sold in shops.

88
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,850
Well, shall we examine the baby's brain?

89
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,580
Why not? We can just discard it when we're done.

90
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,580
Right. Of course.

91
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,320
Prepare for transmission.

92
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,600
Case number 7847, the seventh prison breakout, successfully resolved.

93
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,880
Analysis of the Earth society in progress.

94
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,990
There are cases where human minds can reject our implanted memories.

95
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,810
There is a high possibility that humans are more complicated than we anticipated.

96
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:16,130
Hey.

97
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,510
How much longer do we have to stay here?

98
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,190
That information is not provided.

99
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:26,340
The next prisoner convoy is expected to arrive in ten years and eight months.

100
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:26,840
End of transmission.

101
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,010
End of transmission.

102
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,630
Ten years and eight months.

103
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,530
Aigoo.

104
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:49,640
Have you ever put your hand into the mist rising from a waterfall?

105
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,990
Ah, so it's like... you can smell the water?

106
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:53,630
Hm.

107
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,990
That's nonsense.

108
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,600
As I was saying, when you put your hand in the mist,

109
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,620
where does the air end and the water begin? The mist and your hand become one entity.

110
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,540
Master.

111
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,660
Let's have a demonstration.

112
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,260
It's not something that one can really demonstrate but...

113
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,880
With the ancient art of Dosa,

114
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,520
Mureuk can even summon the wind! With one motion, he-

115
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:25,260
I don't want to disappoint the people who came out to see the cherry blossoms...

116
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,390
but I can't disappoint my customers either.

117
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:35,100
And when you are as advanced as I, you are immune to injury of any kind.

118
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,610
Of any kind?

119
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,590
Yes.

120
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,550
Here. Take that, and right here-

121
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,890
So I can do this, then?

122
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,730
A knife??

123
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,890
You didn't even hesitate, you just-

124
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,710
Handkerchief. Han- Han-

125
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,210
I'll take it out!

126
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:54,900
No, dont-

127
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:56,970
I said, don't!

128
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,200
It's fine.

129
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,200
Emergency! Thieves in the village!

130
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,180
Hey! Did you say there were bounty hunters in town?

131
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,370
Over here! Over here!

132
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,090
He'll catch them for you!

133
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,520
Are these the men?

134
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,860
Oh, yes!

135
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,730
Let's get to work. Shall we catch some thieves?

136
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,830
Three men are running.

137
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,580
There's a bell.

138
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,050
Are there shrines nearby?

139
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,050
That way!

140
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,760
What are you running from?

141
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,280
Goodness. Just because it's there, doesn't mean you can steal it.

142
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,020
Think of your next life. Do you want to live like this then, too?

143
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,790
I hope you can learn from this and become a productive member of society.

144
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,420
What was that?

145
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,030
Well then. Looks like we're about to fill a bounty.

146
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:05,020
Oh look, it's that Mureuk guy with the cats.

147
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,530
Lay down your goods!

148
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:10,260
We will be enacting justice on this beautiful day.

149
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,930
Who's enacting justice?

150
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,680
What are you saying about filling bounties when I'm already here and-

151
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,010
No, come on now, whoever gets their sights on a bounty first has dibs right?

152
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:25,200
Isn't that so?

153
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
I have a claim to thi-

154
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,990
Tie yourselves up properly. Now.

155
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,540
That is, if you want your eardrums intact.

156
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,190
Where did you guys come from, anyway?

157
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:51,990
Aw, again?

158
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,220
I'm telling you, this bounty is mine.

159
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,700
In the wind, of the wind.

160
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,700
Out you come.

161
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,780
Was it like this?

162
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,960
You presume to imitate Gangwon's ancient traditions? If you studied for a hundred years, you couldn't-

163
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,460
Bounty for three thieves, successfully filled.

164
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,450
Hey Mureuk!

165
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,320
Take a look at the new listings!

166
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,240
Let's see...

167
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,390
What kind of bastard should we catch next?

168
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,760
Definitely someone going for a high price.

169
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,220
What a bunch of louts.

170
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,090
Look at this one here.

171
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,860
That's the face of a woman born to be a criminal.

172
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,070
50 pil?

173
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,600
Twenty-

174
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,630
No, two hundred- Wait no-

175
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,360
Two thousand pil?

176
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,380
Wait, I've seen this somewhere b-

177
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,710
Are you okay?

178
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,410
Do you have another headache?

179
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:51,260
This description is just so vivid, it really makes me feel like I've seen it myself.

180
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,260
Ah, that one.

181
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,590
And you know who's in for public intoxication right now, right?

182
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,200
Here we go~

183
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,100
Gotta go see Dogturd.

184
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,000
Do you know where Dogturd is, Master?

185
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,430
Might be worth talking to.

186
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,390
Don't you worry.

187
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,760
I know Dogturd well.

188
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,460
Aigoo, my lord.

189
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,080
This poor bastard has come to see his beloved father, Dogturd.

190
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,650
Greet the man.

191
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,810
His poor father is going to drink himself to death.

192
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:18,180
Ah, what's this?

193
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,610
A gift of our esteem.

194
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:20,390
Have just a sip, sir.

195
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,400
Oh, it looks like very fine stuff...

196
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:26,610
So sweet!

197
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,520
Hits the spot!

198
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,060
Since you brought this here, you can take a cup in to your father before you go.

199
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,050
Can I?

200
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,790
Your kindness will surely be rewarded.

201
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,200
Your son is here to see you!

202
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,200
He's crying and everything.

203
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,180
I have a son?

204
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,930
Father...

205
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,800
Your son Mureuk is here to see you.

206
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,340
Mureuk, you bastard -

207
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,060
You should be ashamed to show your face around me, you thieving bastard!

208
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,880
If you say another word, I'll -

209
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,970
That's how happy he is to see him! Such a welcome!

210
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,340
That's a lot of hurtful words, Father.

211
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,380
What can you tell me about this?

212
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,320
Do you think I'd tell you?

213
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:21,600
Even if I trusted you, you couldn't offer me enough to get me to talk.

214
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,260
Get out of here before I kill you!

215
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,540
Then I guess my Father doesn't want this key.

216
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,740
Oh, my beloved son!

217
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,660
Come to his ailing father...

218
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,050
Tell me about the knife.

219
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,030
I'll tell you what I know.

220
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:41,300
On August fifth, a strange knife came up in a net near Mount Hwangnyeong.

221
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,100
It had a strange jewel for a blade.

222
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,930
At first, they had thoughts of selling the jewel...

223
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:52,290
But even the blacksmith couldn't separate it from the hilt.

224
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,140
When the knife ricocheted into the crowd, it struck a man and should have killed him...

225
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,900
But he got up as if he was unharmed!

226
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,810
Surely this is a precious artifact that must be protected!

227
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,100
Don't you think?

228
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,230
Then who has the knife now?

229
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,370
Well, that's -

230
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:20,510
It was bought by a man who was a Hwangneung magistrate a long time ago.

231
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,400
But nowadays, it belongs to a man in Gyeseong.

232
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:27,570
He runs a place called Byeoknanjung.

233
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,500
Ah, this is all very exciting.

234
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,040
Your son will see himself out now.

235
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,210
Be careful.

236
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,530
That man is the best Dosa in the country.

237
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:38,080
How good a Dosa could an ex-magistrate be, honestly?

238
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:43,270
Oh, my father, if only you could change your ways...

239
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,750
It's been a long time since you've gone up against another Dosa.

240
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,500
I wonder if you'll be a match for him.

241
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,200
I may lack in formal training,

242
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,730
but I've got on-the-job experience. Every day!

243
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,050
Practical knowledge beats book learning. Everyone knows that.

244
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,850
Don't I look like a man at the top of the game?

245
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,110
The top- Do you really think that?

246
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,570
After all, you're the rightful owner of that fan!

247
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,720
Aren't you? Why didn't you say anything?

248
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,020
We're only following you because you said you were the owner of the fan.

249
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,890
Come to think of it, you've still never drawn the great sword.

250
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,080
You think I can't draw the sword? Huh?

251
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:13,850
Is that what you think?

252
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:17,180
I'm gonna draw the sword and then you're all gonna be sorry!

253
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,180
I'm really doing it!

254
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:19,630
Here we go!

255
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:21,690
He's really doing it!

256
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,060
Today's the day!

257
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,060
In the wind, of the wind.

258
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,730
You see this? You see it?

259
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:35,530
Seems heavy.

260
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,890
Next time.

261
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:40,600
Too many people around.

262
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,620
That's right. Don't wanna startle anyone.

263
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,830
I'm becoming more and more suspicious that you aren't actually our rightful owner.

264
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,690
If you're going to talk back this much, I'll just turn you back into a cat.

265
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,360
Don't be like that. Leave us human.

266
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,390
Who's human?

267
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,220
Sit down.

268
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:52,910
Let's have a quick drink.

269
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,510
We'd like to order, ma'am!

270
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,360
The way I see it, you'll get the upper hand on the magistrate no matter what!

271
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,180
Ma'am, where is Byeoknanjung from here?

272
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:01,940
Go that way and it's straight ahead.

273
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:07,650
Who's that?

274
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,420
I've never seen clothes like that before.

275
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,340
Right?

276
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,180
[BYEOKNANJUNG]

277
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,080
I'm good for anything!

278
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:28,340
He got it!

279
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,730
Can I speak with you gents for a moment?

280
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:37,050
I heard there was a man here who used to be a magistrate.

281
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,550
Do you know him?

282
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,140
I've heard of that fan. You can name your price for it.

283
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,750
Ah this?

284
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,250
It's an heirloom. It's priceless to me.

285
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,620
Lot of people eating here...

286
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,360
How can something be an heirloom if you stole it?

287
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,180
Like a coward.

288
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,820
You're lucky I have to be nice to my elders.

289
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,370
You can't just go around accusing people of stealing things!

290
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:56,820
Hey, you bastard!

291
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,700
We don't allow your kind in here!

292
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,370
The magistrate...

293
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,370
None of that indoors, thank you.

294
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,610
This isn't about physical strength, this is about force of will.

295
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,450
You can't think it, so you can't do it.

296
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,370
What nonsense is -

297
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,140
Do you know me?

298
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,910
I know men like you.

299
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:31,690
Stop chasing after bounties and live honestly.

300
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,800
You can get back to your meals, gentlemen.

301
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,240
Help me...

302
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,280
Help!

303
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,710
Has our guest arrived?

304
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:49,620
Yes. And the information you asked for.

305
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,760
Why is this so difficult?

306
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,660
His name isn't listed.

307
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,450
You said you know what this is.

308
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,800
Of course I know.

309
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,810
How did you learn of it?

310
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,290
Because it's ours.

311
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:16,540
Ours?

312
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,110
Yep.

313
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:19,250
And who is that?

314
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:24,980
Where did the magistrate go?

315
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,350
The magistrate? He's upstairs.

316
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,670
It seemed like he knew you.

317
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,750
Me? I've never seen the man in my life.

318
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,080
Do you see him? That looks like Dogturd.

319
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,820
Dogturd?

320
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,210
You're right. Ugh, I can smell him.

321
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,620
He must be after the knife.

322
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,150
In the wind, of the wind.

323
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,620
In the wind, of the wind.

324
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,650
In. The. Wind. Of. The. Wind!

325
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,670
Are you hurt?

326
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,990
The knife... Don't awaken...

327
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:31,860
Don't -

328
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,800
What do you m-

329
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,740
I think Dogturd's stolen it!

330
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,500
I see you eat well here.

331
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,420
You showed him!

332
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,130
You good?

333
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,340
I'm fine, I'm fine.

334
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,040
You stole that knife again, didn't you?

335
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,450
It's not like that!

336
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,330
Go! Run!

337
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,730
Where is he?

338
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:17,280
He's here, he's here!

339
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,060
Master, master!

340
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:20,440
Mureuk!

341
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:22,770
Mureuk!

342
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:24,920
Wake up!

343
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,300
Where did he go?

344
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,360
We've got to find that knife.

345
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,690
Well this is interesting. How did he do this to you?

346
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,460
Dogturd made a run for it again.

347
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,020
Are you alright?

348
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,670
I think I threw my back out.

349
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,930
Why does my cheek hurt?

350
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,290
Did you hit me?

351
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,370
Me?

352
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:47,220
Noooo. Why would I do that?

353
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,810
Hey, wow! Would you look at that?

354
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:07,980
What is this?

355
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,080
Is it a stone?

356
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,660
What kind of stone shines like that?

357
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,980
Whatever it is, it looks like money.

358
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,390
It must have surfaced because of the the drought.

359
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,170
- It's making a noise.
- Hey there's someone over there.

360
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:55,340
We called you because there's a problem with Yian.

361
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:59,400
She recently went to a police station and tried to report you.

362
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,650
When the police asked why she'd come,

363
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:05,610
She said that you had kidnapped her,

364
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:09,850
and that you had been messing with her memory since then, and so on.

365
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:12,850
Well, let's just play the tape.

366
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,350
We got it straight from the station.

367
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:18,410
Why does your father play with your brain?

368
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,570
Is he a doctor?

369
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:20,690
No, ma'am.

370
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:22,690
Honestly, he's not my father.

371
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,010
He's a robot.

372
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:25,210
Like a cyborg.

373
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,370
Well, that's exciting.

374
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,120
And how can you tell your father is a robot?

375
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,250
That's a good question. You see, I took a video yesterday-

376
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:36,790
Because sometimes he's not my dad, he's Thunder.

377
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,330
So I doubted-

378
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,080
Who's Thunder?

379
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,410
He's the car my father drives,

380
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,410
but sometimes he changes into my father.

381
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,910
I remember from when they took me.

382
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,550
Oh, they've already erased the video.

383
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,020
I should have been more careful.

384
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,630
I'll get another video and come back.

385
00:26:55,630 --> 00:27:00,310
And she left the station and came to school. What are your thoughts?

386
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,810
Wipe the video from the station.

387
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:07,600
It's already done.

388
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,290
That woman's been watching you. Be careful.

389
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:10,890
Which one?

390
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:11,830
Straight ahead.

391
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:13,840
Afternoon!

392
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,230
You must be waiting for Yian!

393
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,450
I'm Minsun's aunt.

394
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:20,100
I see.

395
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,610
Minsun and Yian are such good friends!

396
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,330
Probably because they're both so bad at soccer.

397
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,920
I bet they'll be lifelong friends! Don't you think so?

398
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,340
Sure.

399
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,860
Would you like some coffee?

400
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:33,980
I've seen you around the school a few times,

401
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,120
so I figured I should introduce myself!

402
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,400
How old are you? Do you own any real estate?

403
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,020
My aunt thinks your dad is handsome.

404
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,960
He is.

405
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,760
That's where I got my good looks.

406
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,540
But what can we do?

407
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,890
My dad doesn't like her.

408
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,560
He looks like he's playing dodgeball.

409
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,860
She'll be fine. Look at her.

410
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,880
She's a woman who never gives up.

411
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,770
Auntie!

412
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,790
Hey Minsun!

413
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,820
Ah, so you're Yian! You're so pretty!

414
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,460
Did you get your good looks from your dad?

415
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,710
These are a little something I baked up myself.

416
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,000
These are for you and Yian!

417
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,900
They're shockingly good.

418
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:15,700
Drive safe.

419
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:18,060
Let's go!

420
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:18,520
Kay.

421
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,250
What?

422
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,310
What did the principal say?

423
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:36,150
Aren't you curious what I did with my friends today?

424
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:36,890
No, I'm not.

425
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,660
Ah. I see.

426
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,120
Thanks for the ride, Thunder.

427
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,860
Who are you talking to?

428
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,330
To him.

429
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,990
Cars can't talk.

430
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,920
Thunder used to. When I was little.

431
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:01,910
I remember.

432
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,430
Your days are numbered...

433
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,110
Have you been talking to her?

434
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,270
Not a word.

435
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,350
I mean, I did when she was younger.

436
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,310
Does she remember that far back?

437
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,560
But what's Thunder?

438
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,030
Is that my name?

439
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,240
Quit it.

440
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,760
Something's weird.

441
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,560
You talk too much.

442
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,570
Why would that have been erased? My name?

443
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,960
Just give me the report.

444
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,230
Report: Nineteenth prisoner convoy. High-ranking Paros.

445
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:41,830
Will arrive on earth for implantation. 107 subjects needed.

446
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,550
Implantation? What's that?

447
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,330
Location.

448
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,520
I'm still searching.

449
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:51,950
We'll need 107 human hosts. Convoy estimated to arrive in eighteen hours.

450
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:54,230
Eighteen hours. That's tomorrow.

451
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,050
Every night at 9 o'clock, my father disappears,

452
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,210
and all the lights go out.

453
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:04,600
There it is.

454
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:11,850
Thunder!

455
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:15,890
Too good for me?

456
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,040
I see how it is.

457
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,410
Guess I gotta get all my answers myself.

458
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,340
What is that?

459
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:34,310
Don't.

460
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:35,080
Huh?

461
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:44,920
Don't.

462
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,230
Don't touch that!

463
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:51,100
Thunder.

464
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,160
From when I was little.

465
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:55,640
But... Why is my name Thunder?

466
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,940
You don't like it?

467
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,310
I'm getting used to it.

468
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,610
It's good.

469
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,660
So, what exactly are you?

470
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,690
Where did you come from?

471
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:10,190
For your first question, I am a program,

472
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,890
that processes data and can vary its physical form.

473
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:13,950
What would you like?

474
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:15,990
Your dad?

475
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:20,630
But... you're not...

476
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,840
Are you a hologram?

477
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,790
No, I'm real. I'm really here.

478
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:26,930
I even used to hold you.

479
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,620
You asked where I'm from!

480
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,520
You came all the way from there?

481
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,180
Does that mean you and Dad are aliens?

482
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,550
To me, you're the alien.

483
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,110
Is my Dad your boss?

484
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,560
Boss? No.

485
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,320
We're comrades. Equals.

486
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,190
I just leave the combat to him because I'm against violence.

487
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,260
Is your home far away?

488
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,150
Well, it's far, but it doesn't take us very long beca-

489
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,370
Einstein.

490
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,150
You're fast.

491
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,490
You grew up so smart!

492
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,770
You even found my name for me.

493
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:09,030
Really? Hey! You're the one who changes the snacks in the vending machine!

494
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,410
I do! How do you eat so much fish jerky?

495
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,930
- Right? And corn snacks!      - Right!

496
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:15,800
Oh and what and where is the implantation tomorrow?

497
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,200
Ah at the hospital? They'll find bodies for the prisoners.

498
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,420
Implantation.

499
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,720
You heard the message.

500
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,920
Traitor.

501
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,830
I'm not a traitor. I just wanted to kn-

502
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,590
Your dad's coming. Get out! Quickly!

503
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:39,840
Wait.

504
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,280
Where did I come from?

505
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,310
I'll tell you next time! You gotta go!

506
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,520
Tell me, please!

507
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,630
Where did I come from?

508
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:49,870
The past! 646 years ago!

509
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:52,640
And forget what I told you about the hospital!

510
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,970
You have to!

511
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,410
Who were you just talking to?

512
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,310
Just now?

513
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,360
There's a new message.

514
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:06,480
implantation will take place 8 km from here, at Jisang Hospital.

515
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,330
Are you okay?

516
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,190
I'm fine.

517
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:42,690
What are you filming?

518
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,370
I just like making records of people.

519
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,360
You never know when you'll lose your memory.

520
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,580
You're a little morbid.

521
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,650
What kinds of things do you forget?

522
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:53,630
Nothing yet, but... you never know.

523
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,460
Hang on.

524
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,520
If anything happens, call me, okay? I'm a cop.

525
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,320
Pass.

526
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:09,810
Do you see that? It's pretty!

527
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:29,430
Preparation for prisoner extraction is complete.

528
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,210
What is-

529
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,690
What are you doing here?

530
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,710
What did I come in here for?

531
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:55,580
Poor man.

532
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,460
Oh, what a devastating loss...

533
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,730
We had so much left to talk about.

534
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:06,230
This is the first time I've seen you like this.

535
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,410
I told you he was the one with the knife, didn't I?

536
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:10,900
You did.

537
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,890
And that other man stole it!

538
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,010
A criminal!

539
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,550
What kind of Dosa could he be?

540
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,990
First of all,

541
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,050
I feel certain he isn't a Dosa.

542
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:22,410
The thief was here. Something sharp went through the wall and and smashed the door.

543
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,600
Maybe the stolen item?

544
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,010
Somehow, I don't think so.

545
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,470
A tentacle?

546
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:31,570
Here?

547
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,500
Here, of all places?

548
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,470
My heart races.

549
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,290
Is it like that thing we saw-?

550
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,990
I think so.

551
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:38,350
Do you remember?

552
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,700
That man who's been living in Milbon.

553
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,360
Yes, I think we should pay him a visit.

554
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,060
I think we should.

555
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,520
Are you... the mages of Samgak mountain?

556
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,650
Correct.

557
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:47,630
And you sell the trinkets?

558
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,300
Trinkets? Are you hearing this guy?

559
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,310
The people in town said this guy has lived here for ten years!

560
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:55,510
He is extremely dan-

561
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,530
Are you actually going in?

562
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,620
Yeah.

563
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,420
Not gonna check it out or-

564
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,780
Locate the Divine Sword in the temple and bring it to the agreed-upon location.

565
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:10,900
Locate what?

566
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,920
The what?

567
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,390
Do you think it's the temple at Milbon?

568
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,320
Are they the ones ordering this?

569
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,040
Why would they be looking for the same knife?

570
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,310
Whoa. This picture is strange.

571
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,160
What is that?

572
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:23,250
Oh!

573
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,740
Why do I feel like I've seen this square thing before?

574
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:29,930
So the guy who lived here was actually just crazy, then.

575
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,950
Where could someone see all these weird things?

576
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,620
That was an awfully long way to come, just to be able to knock on this fine door.

577
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,950
I sure hope he hasn't gone anywhere.

578
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:02,290
From what you told me, that doesn't seem to be his style.

579
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:07,380
I heard he hasn't stepped foot outside these gates since he arrived here ten years ago.

580
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,340
What kind of person do you suppose he is?

581
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:13,990
Let's sell our little trinkets as hard as we can and see if we can figure that out.

582
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,170
The mages of Samgak mountain have arrived, my lord.

583
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,970
Goodness gracious, the man himself.

584
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:27,990
He's overjoyed to see us. I can feel it even through his mask.

585
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:28,690
You're so right.

586
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:32,630
So you're the incredible mages I've heard so much about.

587
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:35,160
Thank you for gracing me with your presence.

588
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,500
If we hear that Milbon has interest in our wares, of course we must come right away.

589
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,280
Let us show you what we can offer.

590
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:40,830
things

591
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:45,750
The products that we have offered Milbon so far pale in comparison to the wares we bring you today.

592
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,300
For example, this talisman...

593
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,920
can allow me to be in two places at once.

594
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,310
Watch closely.

595
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:04,100
Ah, I see this is not what you're looking for.

596
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,670
Let's try something else.

597
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:09,500
Don't go anywhere.

598
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,740
I have caught you fast.

599
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:14,050
If you are so kind to purchase one from us, I will add a second one in gratitude.

600
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:16,110
I see.

601
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,960
And here! We have this magnificent bronze mirror!

602
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:23,070
Other mirrors can simply not compare.

603
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:28,500
A dishonest man can look into this mirror and see his dishonesty magnified tenfold.

604
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,860
And I can see my own beauty and purity.

605
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,030
Would you like to have a look?

606
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:37,320
In Milbon, our own appearances are of no importance.

607
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,860
How wise of you.

608
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,960
But the mirror's magnifying powers can be of other uses as well.

609
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,440
With its help, small things don't have to be small.

610
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,940
Just one drink can become enough for an entire gathering.

611
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:52,020
And in a fight, just one small fist can become an entire army.

612
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,010
Keep your eyes on my hand.

613
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:58,350
Alright, here we go.

614
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:00,680
Oh, there's going to be big trouble as soon as I do this.

615
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,920
I think we've shown him enough.

616
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,520
I'm amazed to hear that mere humans could make such extraordinary products like this.

617
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,410
Yes, aren't we quite remarkable.

618
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,120
And this.

619
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:12,860
A priceless Arabian whetstone.

620
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:18,070
Even if thousands of soldiers used this stone every day, it would take 15 years to begin to wear away.

621
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,920
The blade's edge will hold for three years.

622
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,400
It's priceless when you think about it.

623
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,000
But if you had to put a price on it...

624
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,310
70 pil, at least.

625
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,440
Oho!

626
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,200
Ah, there's no reason to bring that up if you're not interested.

627
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:31,060
Did you find something?

628
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:34,070
If you are not charmed by our wares on first glance, there is no point in selling them to you.

629
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,030
Let's see if that bar is still around here.

630
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:40,410
It's been so long, I really wonder...

631
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,440
Waste of a meeting.

632
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,450
Do the two of you really know where the Divine Knife is?

633
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:45,260
Of course.

634
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,710
Bukchon, in the hands of a business owner.

635
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:49,400
Or it was, at least.

636
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,930
Unfortunately, a man named Dogturd stole it.

637
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,050
Is there any way that Milbon can assist you in finding it?

638
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:58,580
Ho ho.

639
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,990
An excellent question.

640
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:13,910
What do these bastards think they're doing?

641
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:15,890
Oh, the groom is a very fine man indeed.

642
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:19,350
And sporting a fine mustache. Did you see that mustache?

643
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:25,000
What? Dismount.

644
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:27,060
Lend me your mustache.

645
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:27,890
My- My mustache?

646
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:28,630
Yep.

647
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,320
He's here. He's here!

648
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,330
The groom has arrived!

649
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:53,370
The groom is a real man!

650
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:59,040
Everyone gather 'round quickly!

651
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,230
Is it over there, do you think?

652
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:03,340
I'm not sure.

653
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,840
The bride and groom are gathered! Let the ceremony begin!

654
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,720
Let's share our first drink together!

655
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,400
Um. What comes off first?

656
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,410
My bride...

657
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,560
...is beautiful.

658
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,440
But...

659
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:46,020
Haven't we met somewhere before?

660
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:47,800
That's impossible.

661
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,990
What if we just-

662
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:53,220
Get rid of-

663
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,070
What is this?

664
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:10,050
It's nothing that you need to concern yourself with.

665
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:14,830
Shall we start with a drink?

666
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:16,910
Sure. Let's do that.

667
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:24,640
Shouldn't we let our master enjoy himself?

668
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,360
We have work to do! We can't be playing dress-up!

669
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,330
Ridiculous.

670
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,490
Oh look, they steamed fish!

671
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,850
It's not even in season!

672
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:35,790
This precious stuff...

673
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:36,560
First...

674
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:38,010
A little snack.

675
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:38,990
Yes, just a little.

676
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:40,750
It's not spring, no...

677
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:42,620
But this fish is even better in the fall!

678
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:44,080
I think you're right.

679
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,190
Ah, just one second. I need to take care of something.

680
00:46:58,570 --> 00:46:59,350
I can't seem to believe it.

681
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:01,650
That I've married someone like you.

682
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:14,970
He's cute.

683
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:21,630
Why are you being so insistent?

684
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,560
I had to make sure it wasn't in there!

685
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,020
Master, we heard it's in the family storehouse, over that wall.

686
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:26,840
I get it, I get it.

687
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,670
Were you drinking?

688
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:29,230
I just had a little one.

689
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:50,330
What-

690
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:52,630
What's happening to me?

691
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,670
We are the dual mages of Mount Samgak.

692
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:14,660
No one leaves this house.

693
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,690
Bring us the contents of your storehouse and don't cause any trouble.

694
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:23,940
We are aided by the Dosa of Milbon...

695
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,140
So don't cross that line if you want to see morning.

696
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,800
Stop them immediately!

697
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,230
What do you think you're doing?

698
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:50,400
I don't know what the hell you're doing here

699
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,300
But you get out of my house bef-

700
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,070
Your will is mine.

701
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:06,430
Yes.

702
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,000
Your will is mine.

703
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:15,340
Bring me what you've hidden.

704
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,080
Your will is mine.

705
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:21,230
Bring me your hidden treasures.

706
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:22,720
Yes.

707
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,020
Anything you say.

708
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:29,450
Aigoo.

709
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,500
My lady! What are you doing here?

710
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:35,000
What happened to you?

711
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:37,010
Eunnie, eunnie!

712
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:40,070
They tied me up like this!

713
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,350
But if you're here... then who got married?

714
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,900
Sorry to have kept you waiting-

715
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,820
Bring the Divine Knife to me immediately!

716
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:02,690
Wait, are you- Are you not the real bride?

717
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,280
Seems like you're not the real groom, either.

718
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:07,950
Wait...

719
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:11,060
Did you drug me?

720
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:12,190
Yeah.

721
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:13,150
'Yeah'??

722
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,330
You won't die. Don't worry.

723
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:22,130
Antidote.

724
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:25,260
There must be an antidote.

725
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:26,710
There isn't.

726
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,760
There isn't?

727
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:30,300
Just sleep it off. You'll be fine.

728
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,710
I'll take care of those bastards.

729
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,410
I'm the only one who can.

730
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:39,930
You've got this.

731
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,750
You can do it.

732
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:42,850
You are...

733
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,370
Out of your mind!

734
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:49,840
I know I'm not the real bride,

735
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:51,740
but I'll remember today very fondly.

736
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,370
Stay where you are!

737
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:12,810
Ah, so that's a gun.

738
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:14,360
It doesn't matter.

739
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:17,530
Give that to me.

740
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:18,510
Yes, ma'am.

741
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:21,140
Don't move.

742
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:35,190
By the way... how are you at solving puzzles?

743
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:08,860
That's very sharp.

744
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:14,680
Ow, that stings!

745
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:17,190
I've got her!

746
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,480
Bring the girl with us.

747
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:57,810
Yes, sir.

748
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:01,940
Mureuk!

749
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,110
He's coming to.

750
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:08,430
Massage him, massage him.

751
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:10,390
Where did that woman come from?

752
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:11,990
I tried to ask her that, but -

753
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:13,020
The groom is inside.

754
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,190
Let's get out of here.

755
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:19,780
Hey, that thing.

756
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,160
The bang-bang! Grab it!

757
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,250
The bang-bang? This -

758
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:24,630
What?  What is this?

759
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,740
What's a bang-bang?

760
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:31,510
Hey, Yian.

761
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,330
Why weren't you at school?

762
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,830
I ran away from home.

763
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:36,890
Can I stay over tonight?

764
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:39,980
Oh my God! Is this really our hospital?

765
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:41,580
And you filmed this yourself?

766
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:42,230
Right.

767
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:44,780
What are those things going into their heads?

768
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:46,780
Is your dad one of those things?

769
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,320
Shh.

770
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:49,440
Auntie?

771
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:50,620
Huh?

772
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:52,910
I'm- I'm not doing anything.

773
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:54,830
I'm just passing by. Naturally.

774
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:56,390
I'm going away...

775
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,160
We've arrived in from of Minsun's house.

776
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,140
I never know what to say to humans.

777
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:06,900
You go instead.

778
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:08,310
Me?

779
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:10,130
What appearance should I use?

780
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,060
Me! I'll do it! Pick me!

781
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:14,870
I've always wanted to persuade a human!

782
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,470
Have you ever spoken to a human?

783
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:17,290
You haven't, have you?

784
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,290
I'm just waiting for the right opportunity.

785
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:20,670
I know a little bit about humans.

786
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:21,550
I'll go.

787
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:22,900
Hold your horses.

788
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,320
Do you know how to seduce a woman?

789
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:25,850
Have either of you ever talked to one?

790
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,660
Speak deeply, make eye contact, ask questions, hold her waist.

791
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:32,320
Do you have any experience in these things?

792
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:34,260
Should we all three go then?

793
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:36,260
No. Just one of you. Just one.

794
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:38,640
You do it.

795
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:40,670
Just keep it short.

796
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:41,400
and get Yian.

797
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,970
That's the spirit.

798
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:44,240
Shall we?

799
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,390
Let's steal some hearts.

800
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:12,410
Oh, hello...

801
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:13,550
There you are.

802
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:14,720
So.

803
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:16,480
Ah, did you come to get Yian?

804
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,370
Isn't it obvious?

805
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:20,530
I know that you're interested in me.

806
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:20,980
I am?

807
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:21,980
You are.

808
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:28,990
Ah, I had wondered if I could call you up sometime.
Is that alright then?

809
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:29,970
Yes.

810
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:32,210
You should definitely do that.

811
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:37,170
Should I get Yian, then? She's upstairs.

812
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,990
I'd rather keep talking to you.

813
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,490
What's your name?

814
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:43,960
Ah, I'm Min Gye-in. (sounds like 'alien')

815
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:48,870
I already know.

816
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:50,910
Why would my mom call me that, right?

817
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,810
I've picked up a lot of nicknames. Well. Mostly just 'Alien, Alien.'

818
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:55,790
Minsun!

819
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,460
Miss Min Gye-in.

820
00:56:59,060 --> 00:56:59,940
The thing about you...

821
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:02,470
Is you're so lucky...

822
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:04,600
You're no alien.

823
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,160
Very kind of you.

824
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,890
Welp. Let's head out.

825
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:41,940
What went into those people at the hospital?

826
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,920
I'm asking you a question!

827
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,720
Ooh, she's mad.

828
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,200
Do you still not understand humans?

829
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,400
There's no point in trying to hide things from them.

830
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,600
Yian. Sit, sit.

831
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,300
What went into those people?

832
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,540
So then. We will answer exactly three of your questions.

833
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:00,630
Okay? So!

834
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:02,720
What went into those people?

835
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:04,370
Ah, that.

836
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:06,390
So the thing is...

837
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:10,250
for a really long time we've been locking up our planet's prisoners in human bodies.

838
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:10,560
Right?

839
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,250
Stop.

840
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:12,730
No, I've got this.

841
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:17,910
Every planet is the same, right? There's civilization, there's war, there's a decline in population...

842
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:19,670
But everybody wants peace.

843
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,550
We have criminals like anybody else, sure.

844
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:23,420
But then a whole new problem appears.

845
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:25,340
Our population starts mutating.

846
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:28,140
Life and peace turned upside down!

847
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:31,200
Mututions so powerful they can destroy and kill.

848
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,680
Then what?

849
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,270
So then you need a prison.

850
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:36,770
You have to take them so far away that they can never come back.

851
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:41,210
The most impenetrable place there is.

852
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:42,840
A prison that even the wardens won't remember.

853
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,330
The human mind.

854
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:48,040
Put a criminal in there,

855
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:51,540
And they're trapped, until the human dies and destroys them both.

856
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:54,190
That's how we do it.

857
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:55,690
But we haven't agreed to this.

858
00:58:56,210 --> 00:58:57,300
Going into our brains without permission?

859
00:58:57,350 --> 00:58:58,720
Why would we need permission?

860
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,820
You shouldn't treat people like that.

861
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:02,450
Humans matter.

862
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:04,420
You grew up so smart!

863
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:05,890
It's your best trait.

864
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:06,400
Shut up.

865
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:08,450
Next question.

866
00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:10,620
Can these criminals leave their human bodies?

867
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:13,260
For a little bit, but the atmosphere is different here.

868
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,300
About what, five minutes?

869
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,040
Yeah. They can stay out for about that long.

870
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:20,620
If they awaken, I trap and store them.

871
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:21,570
Where?

872
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:22,380
Here.

873
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,230
There's a room back there?

874
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:35,470
If they awaken...

875
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:37,520
People get hurt?

876
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,440
That's what I'm here to prevent.

877
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,390
So you're protecting us.

878
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:42,830
I'm a Guard who manages prisoners.

879
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,200
Humans are not my concern.

880
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,610
Question time is over.

881
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,990
Then why did you raise me?

882
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:55,600
Question time is over.

883
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:13,500
I can sleep here tonight, right?

884
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,040
Thanks.

885
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:21,930
How long have you been on Earth, Thunder?

886
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:23,040
Have you always been here?

887
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:27,430
Why did you bring me with you?

888
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:34,500
If we didn't, you would have died.

889
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,910
Sleep tight, Yian.

890
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:41,220
Good night, Thunder.

891
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:14,320
Suspect is heading toward you.

892
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,120
Operation commencing.

893
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:18,120
What are you doing? Hold the line!

894
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:34,880
Stop right there!

895
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,990
This is police harassment, you know.

896
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:40,460
Ah, what a waste.

897
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:52,160
Don't shoot me! Don't shoot!

898
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:54,290
Thank you for everything.

899
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:56,860
Hey, Moon Doseok.

900
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:57,420
Yeah.

901
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:59,170
What do you think you're doing, shooting at a civilian?

902
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,590
Just a little warning shot at a criminal.

903
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:03,040
Hey.

904
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,540
Next time, you should hit me.

905
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:08,450
Detectives never get the job done.

906
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:09,600
Excuse us.

907
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:30,890
Where's the rest of it?

908
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:33,980
I hid it in the bike in the loft.

909
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:36,190
The bike in the loft?

910
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:39,230
Wanna go have a fun night?

911
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:43,540
Ta-da!

912
01:02:45,110 --> 01:02:45,810
What's going on?

913
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:54,610
Go check it out.

914
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:05,470
Mr. Cho?

915
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:26,930
New message incoming.

916
01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:28,090
Escaped prisoners headed for Earth.

917
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:30,270
Armed and dangerous.

918
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:31,110
Capture with care.

919
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:32,250
Did you say armed?

920
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,040
What are you doing?

921
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:39,790
What's wrong with you?

922
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:45,160
Emergency message!

923
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,560
Urgent recovery of a prisoner required!

924
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,080
Who exactly are we supposed to catch?

925
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:53,380
This bastard! He was among the prisoners from the hospital!

926
01:03:58,590 --> 01:03:59,850
Got him! Found the bastard!

927
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:01,080
He's here.

928
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:04,110
Name: Moon Doseok.

929
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:26,570
The bodies were found in the stairwell, and we're trying to obtain the CCTV.

930
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:28,560
We've sent samples from this hatchet off to forensics.

931
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:29,970
The detective isn't answering his phone.

932
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:58,450
Yian, get out.

933
01:04:59,300 --> 01:04:59,790
No.

934
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:02,600
I'm going to see what you and Thunder are doing.

935
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:03,150
Get out.

936
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:04,650
I'm not getting out.

937
01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:05,830
I'm your family. It's my business too.

938
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:09,200
Urgent message!

939
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:12,160
The ship- The ship is approaching the planet!

940
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:13,280
Then hold tight.

941
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,820
There's no way to drive there in time.

942
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:16,710
Then we'll fly.

943
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,590
Dad, what is this?

944
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:29,850
Sit.

945
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:46,860
Moon DoSeok.

946
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:51,900
Where are youu?

947
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:25,020
Stay out of this.

948
01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:30,840
What is Moon Doseok's location?

949
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:33,010
Twenty-first floor. By the elevator.

950
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,360
That thing is catching up to him.

951
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:46,640
Moon DoSeok.

952
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:52,780
Our controller has been locked inside you.

953
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:00,400
Who -

954
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:05,580
I must free the controller from your human body.

955
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:08,490
I will use the Guard's energy to do so.

956
01:07:09,410 --> 01:07:11,470
Are you ready?

957
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,720
Who's the Paro in Moon Doseok?

958
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:28,970
Prisoner #197A: The controller.

959
01:09:29,350 --> 01:09:30,280
The controller?

960
01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:33,600
The same agent of the destruction on our planet.

961
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:36,070
The leader of the rebellion.

962
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:37,750
Do you think they're planning to escape?

963
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:39,410
Or do they want something else?

964
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:49,020
The hell is that?

965
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:23,120
Controller, can you hear me?

966
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,140
Are you ready to be set free?

967
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:27,860
The earth's atmosphere has changed.

968
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,550
It is time to free them all.

969
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:34,260
And we will begin with you.

970
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:36,500
The time... is now.

971
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:39,120
What is this bastard saying?

972
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:55,120
Yian, we're starting.

973
01:11:55,870 --> 01:11:56,810
Thunder, get ready.

974
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:58,180
Yian, hold on tight!

975
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:02,830
Divert energy to weapons.

976
01:12:03,230 --> 01:12:03,770
Levels up!

977
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:18,680
We've got him!

978
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,640
Not yet. We've just winged him.

979
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:21,500
Weapons up!

980
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:33,240
Weapons to their highest level!

981
01:12:36,350 --> 01:12:38,010
Careful! He's right on our tail!

982
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:42,960
Analyze weak points!

983
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:45,320
There's only one point of access to the interior systems.

984
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,060
That bright red part is like its heart!

985
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:49,570
Hit it directly, and you can disrupt their power!

986
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:51,290
It opens every time it shoots!

987
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:57,080
We're catching humans in the crossfire...

988
01:12:59,910 --> 01:13:01,170
Let's get somewhere clear!

989
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:13,490
Ready...

990
01:13:16,210 --> 01:13:16,730
Set...

991
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:17,210
Fire!

992
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:23,940
Its heart moved!

993
01:13:24,930 --> 01:13:25,580
Shield depleted.

994
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:28,250
We've been hit!

995
01:13:28,410 --> 01:13:29,730
Crash is imminent.

996
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:31,770
More energy!

997
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,570
I need more time! I need more time!

998
01:15:04,830 --> 01:15:06,200
Mission complete.

999
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:11,410
The controller is awakened.

1000
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:30,220
The controller is free.

1001
01:15:31,290 --> 01:15:33,720
And now I will self-destruct...

1002
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:35,810
And take you with me.

1003
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:47,380
Warning: Guard's life support activated.

1004
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:48,180
Energy depleted!

1005
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:54,100
Yian!

1006
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:55,020
Wait in the car!

1007
01:15:59,690 --> 01:16:00,980
Energy levels at 17%.

1008
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:02,120
16%. 14%.

1009
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:02,820
Reaching critical levels.

1010
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:10,000
Beginning emergency recharge.

1011
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:01,580
Emergency recharge, in progress.

1012
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:02,160
36%.

1013
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:02,930
38%.

1014
01:17:03,890 --> 01:17:04,950
My reserves are depleted.

1015
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:10,240
The controller is awakened.

1016
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:11,030
We need a status update.

1017
01:17:11,030 --> 01:17:11,920
Understood.

1018
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,100
Try not to move!

1019
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:39,700
The controller has access to the ship.

1020
01:17:53,130 --> 01:17:53,790
Haava.

1021
01:17:54,740 --> 01:17:55,350
It's Haava.

1022
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:57,850
They brought it to this planet!

1023
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:01,370
Haava? All the way from our world?

1024
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:04,830
Earth's atmosphere is too different!

1025
01:18:05,170 --> 01:18:05,750
If they can deploy the Haava,

1026
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,470
They'll be able to change Earth's atmosphere permanently!

1027
01:18:09,070 --> 01:18:10,510
They won't need human bodies anymore.

1028
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:12,460
They could all be awakened!

1029
01:18:16,730 --> 01:18:17,420
If this is released,

1030
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:19,200
all the humans will die in the new atmosphere.

1031
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:20,890
This is truly... the end.

1032
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:22,230
We have to stop the controller!

1033
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,240
Use the energy knife to disrupt the deployment!

1034
01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:39,400
Energy levels falling again!

1035
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:51,870
Stopping the Haava is the important thing.

1036
01:18:59,790 --> 01:19:00,950
Go out and catch the controller

1037
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:02,450
before he can jump into another body!

1038
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:27,950
Yian, are you okay?

1039
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:28,820
What is that thing?

1040
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:30,510
That's what we're here for.

1041
01:19:33,210 --> 01:19:34,260
I don't see the controller.

1042
01:19:35,310 --> 01:19:36,200
Get in the car.

1043
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:42,140
Status report.

1044
01:19:44,010 --> 01:19:45,100
Two doses of Haava have left the ship.

1045
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:46,530
I'll try to contain them.

1046
01:19:47,510 --> 01:19:50,040
Find the controller first. He can't be allowed to set them off.

1047
01:19:59,790 --> 01:20:00,920
Detonate the Haava.

1048
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:03,100
Calling all Paro within range.

1049
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:03,990
Awaken.

1050
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:51,360
Open your eyes! Wake up!

1051
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:53,010
The belt- I can't-

1052
01:21:56,630 --> 01:21:57,790
They've deployed one dose of Haava!

1053
01:21:57,790 --> 01:21:59,400
Save the humans first!

1054
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:03,110
I'm going!

1055
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:22,590
Yian, let's go.

1056
01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:30,300
I'm sending you home.

1057
01:22:30,770 --> 01:22:31,300
Thunder!

1058
01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:35,450
I have to save your world.

1059
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:37,020
Let's go.

1060
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:38,810
I have to find the controller.

1061
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:18,200
The people who died...

1062
01:23:18,930 --> 01:23:20,500
That bright cloud of Haava...

1063
01:23:21,810 --> 01:23:28,230
That day I couldn't forget, even ten years later...

1064
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:37,140
Who are you?

1065
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:41,590
You've grown up. Did you forget me?

1066
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:45,370
We came here together, you know. Ten years ago.

1067
01:23:47,420 --> 01:23:49,910
I'll keep trying to get that knife.

1068
01:23:49,910 --> 01:23:50,720
Sure.

1069
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:53,180
You need that thing we rode here, too.

1070
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:54,560
Where is it?

1071
01:23:54,830 --> 01:23:55,360
Dunno.

1072
01:23:59,930 --> 01:24:01,780
Really? I know.

1073
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:05,080
That's why I need that knife.

1074
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:06,710
Where is it?

1075
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:15,130
It's time you learned what it's like to be in a prison.

1076
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:21,490
We've got time. Think about how you're going to survive the mess you're in.

1077
01:24:21,490 --> 01:24:22,070
Mister.

1078
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:25,690
Why don't you have dinner before you go?

1079
01:24:26,690 --> 01:24:28,130
Like you said. We've got time.

1080
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:52,150
We've been trapped in time.

1081
01:24:52,770 --> 01:24:54,830
We have to find the controller before we go back.

1082
01:24:55,150 --> 01:24:56,930
He must have changed bodies,

1083
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:00,070
but the magistrate wasn't awakened. He just died.

1084
01:25:03,150 --> 01:25:06,020
So whose body could the controller be in?

1085
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:08,350
Four humans saw us that day.

1086
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:14,960
The magistrate died. The dual mages were both cut by the knife, but they were not awakened either.

1087
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:17,500
Now we must only locate the last one.

1088
01:25:18,590 --> 01:25:19,340
It's fine.

1089
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:21,650
She can neither hear nor speak our secrets.

1090
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:27,450
Why are you staying in such a weak body?

1091
01:25:29,050 --> 01:25:30,700
Wouldn't it be better to switch?

1092
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:32,890
I'll love my memories.

1093
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:36,890
And if I don't want to be imprisoned again, I'll need-

1094
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:49,720
Mureuk?

1095
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:50,580
Are you alright?

1096
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:53,620
Isn't it going to be too difficult to get into Milbon?

1097
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:55,380
Difficult?

1098
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:57,080
For us?

1099
01:25:58,770 --> 01:26:01,410
Look at this. If we can just fill this one bounty, then...

1100
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:04,150
This will solve all our problems.

1101
01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:06,360
What do you think it is, anyway?

1102
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,510
It's obviously something important.

1103
01:26:10,030 --> 01:26:12,340
Is it possible to be as handsome and smart as you are?

1104
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:14,550
Just the very smartest! Very most handsome!

1105
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:15,930
Don't you know me?

1106
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:19,320
They're coming.

1107
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:22,600
Shall we get to work?

1108
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:38,370
In the wind, of the wind.

1109
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:05,500
Why are you so late?

1110
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:06,890
Did you find it?

1111
01:27:07,410 --> 01:27:09,140
They're waiting on you. Let's go.

1112
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:10,040
Right.

1113
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:12,250
Are you going to move any faster than that?

1114
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:14,860
We're hurrying.

1115
01:27:15,250 --> 01:27:17,330
Where do you think you're going?

1116
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:18,600
Right, right.

1117
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:25,400
Oh, the medicine is here.

1118
01:27:27,230 --> 01:27:29,260
We have found the medicine, great mages.

1119
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:30,390
It must have been elusive.

1120
01:27:30,390 --> 01:27:30,590
Yes, sir.

1121
01:27:30,930 --> 01:27:31,830
Give it here.

1122
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:32,290
You heard him.

1123
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:38,170
That deadly mushroom...

1124
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:39,580
Chew it thoroughly.

1125
01:27:40,970 --> 01:27:41,870
Which one of you is the antidote expert?

1126
01:27:44,770 --> 01:27:45,590
Our antidote expert...

1127
01:27:46,230 --> 01:27:47,420
Is this man here.

1128
01:27:47,810 --> 01:27:48,250
Right.

1129
01:27:49,110 --> 01:27:49,710
Expert.

1130
01:27:50,550 --> 01:27:51,390
Hurry. Chew it.

1131
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:09,390
Don't stop chewing.

1132
01:28:17,410 --> 01:28:18,270
Mash it up.

1133
01:28:18,430 --> 01:28:19,040
Get some saliva in there.

1134
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:26,270
That's it, that's it.

1135
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:30,210
And now, what you have brought for me.

1136
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:36,440
This?

1137
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:39,740
Here, spit.

1138
01:28:48,530 --> 01:28:50,600
You chewed it very effectively.

1139
01:28:57,060 --> 01:29:01,710
The ship has surfaced in the valley near Byeoknanjung.

1140
01:29:02,690 --> 01:29:04,090
We've got it.

1141
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:12,610
Why is the knife reacting now?

1142
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:15,400
It's lighting up all on its own!

1143
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:18,750
All on its own? It must be special!

1144
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:25,750
It's stopped.

1145
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:29,740
Why are so many people looking for this little thing?

1146
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:33,750
Even after getting injured so many times today,

1147
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:36,050
you still can't keep your hands to yourself.

1148
01:29:37,050 --> 01:29:38,080
She was just wondering.

1149
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:39,540
Right. Just thinking aloud.

1150
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:44,680
I will not be requiring your services any further today.

1151
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:46,700
Have some dinner before you go.

1152
01:29:46,700 --> 01:29:48,700
What are you three doing?

1153
01:29:51,390 --> 01:29:55,030
I'd be very interested to know
what else is going on around here.

1154
01:29:58,140 --> 01:29:58,730
Did you see the knife?

1155
01:30:00,090 --> 01:30:01,400
Let's come back at night.

1156
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:03,170
Obviously.

1157
01:30:03,230 --> 01:30:06,050
The money is as good as ours.

1158
01:30:07,490 --> 01:30:07,860
You.

1159
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:10,410
Take this.

1160
01:30:10,950 --> 01:30:13,640
Give it to the girl out back and return immediately.

1161
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:15,090
Don't speak to her.

1162
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:15,900
Yessir.

1163
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:17,780
You two. Wash the dishes.

1164
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:22,000
Out back?

1165
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:24,920
Where is that?

1166
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:42,770
Such a beautiful day. Even the birds think so.

1167
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:47,610
Let's see, let's see.

1168
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:52,260
Oh, I see.

1169
01:30:52,690 --> 01:30:55,030
And a little gap here.

1170
01:30:56,130 --> 01:30:57,860
How did they make this thing?

1171
01:31:01,430 --> 01:31:03,090
Does the fire cause it?

1172
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:03,860
Well then.

1173
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:07,160
Oh, that didn't do anything.

1174
01:31:07,570 --> 01:31:08,090
Darn.

1175
01:31:08,210 --> 01:31:09,040
Hey.

1176
01:31:10,370 --> 01:31:12,010
Are you that thief?

1177
01:31:12,010 --> 01:31:13,120
Thief? That's harsh.

1178
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:15,160
And after I brought you dinner.

1179
01:31:18,030 --> 01:31:19,310
Am I supposed to eat the flower too?

1180
01:31:19,310 --> 01:31:20,800
Why would you do that?

1181
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:23,630
So you'll even eat flowers to survive.

1182
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:27,690
How did such a brave girl wind up locked up out here?

1183
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:30,620
Same reason as you.

1184
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:31,730
Aren't you here for the knife?

1185
01:31:31,890 --> 01:31:34,730
Of course not. I live right over there.

1186
01:31:34,730 --> 01:31:35,610
Did you steal it yet?

1187
01:31:36,730 --> 01:31:37,170
No, not yet.

1188
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:39,610
But just before I came out here,

1189
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,710
I saw it start glowing

1190
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:44,090
With this beautiful, soft blue light.

1191
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,160
It lit up? In front of you?

1192
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:48,180
I was just there when it happened, but -

1193
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:49,460
But wait.

1194
01:31:50,370 --> 01:31:53,280
I really feel like I met you when I was younger.

1195
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:54,500
But it's foggy.

1196
01:31:55,190 --> 01:31:57,610
If you're about to tell me you like me, please don't.

1197
01:31:57,610 --> 01:31:59,320
We're not really married.

1198
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:04,530
No, listen. I really feel like if I could just remember that day...

1199
01:32:05,410 --> 01:32:06,070
Help me remember.

1200
01:32:07,290 --> 01:32:08,170
Where are you from?

1201
01:32:08,170 --> 01:32:08,890
How did you get here?

1202
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:11,680
Do you really need my life story?

1203
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:15,330
Mr. Thief, just live your life far away from me.

1204
01:32:15,330 --> 01:32:17,210
Earn an honest living.

1205
01:32:17,610 --> 01:32:18,810
I knew you'd say that.

1206
01:32:19,610 --> 01:32:21,830
Now, what is the significance of this?

1207
01:32:23,090 --> 01:32:24,400
Where did this come from?

1208
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:25,740
How does the thunder come out?

1209
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:26,920
Don't pull that!

1210
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:28,480
Give it to me, carefully.

1211
01:32:29,370 --> 01:32:32,180
First, tell me where the knife came from.

1212
01:32:32,180 --> 01:32:33,170
From the future. (mirae)

1213
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:34,740
Mirae?

1214
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:39,090
Mirae?

1215
01:32:39,090 --> 01:32:41,400
Wait, I've been there. That neighborhood by Wolcheongni -

1216
01:32:42,910 --> 01:32:43,680
No, that's not right.

1217
01:32:45,530 --> 01:32:48,100
That was Miorae.

1218
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:49,320
I haven't visited, then.

1219
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:51,810
I came here from over 600 years in the future.

1220
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:53,230
What do you think of that?

1221
01:32:53,230 --> 01:32:55,080
So I'm not getting
any answers from you today, either.

1222
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:57,880
Wow. "What do you think of that?" with such a straight face.

1223
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:00,420
You'll need a better lie than that to get rid of me.

1224
01:33:00,420 --> 01:33:02,260
So you're saying you live there. In the future.

1225
01:33:02,260 --> 01:33:02,720
Yep.

1226
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:03,280
Does that make sense?

1227
01:33:04,230 --> 01:33:06,080
Wait. Wait, let go, there's fire -

1228
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,130
Give me my gun.

1229
01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:09,390
Fire! I'm on fire!

1230
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:10,520
Hot!

1231
01:33:16,710 --> 01:33:18,040
Where is that man?

1232
01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:24,440
I'll give it back,
but I think I'll get the knife first.

1233
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:41,740
Who were you talking to?

1234
01:33:50,610 --> 01:33:50,820
Let's go.

1235
01:34:20,270 --> 01:34:23,560
[THE RECORD OF THE MAGISTRATE]

1236
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:24,660
The girl?

1237
01:34:25,530 --> 01:34:26,910
She ate the food.

1238
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:28,500
She's dying now.

1239
01:34:28,970 --> 01:34:29,590
Bury her.

1240
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:31,010
Bury them both together.

1241
01:34:31,410 --> 01:34:32,210
Understood.

1242
01:34:33,350 --> 01:34:34,700
Bring the knife.

1243
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:36,140
Yes, sir.

1244
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:46,060
Do you know how long it's been
since we ate Milbon's food?

1245
01:34:46,630 --> 01:34:48,170
Ten years, I think.

1246
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:49,720
Let's eat first and -

1247
01:34:53,690 --> 01:34:54,450
Poison... in the food?

1248
01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:55,990
Could it be?

1249
01:34:57,910 --> 01:34:59,090
Let's move quickly.

1250
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:00,350
Before the petrification sets in.

1251
01:35:04,470 --> 01:35:05,310
The antidote, quickly.

1252
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:12,040
The petrification

1253
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:15,610
Is.  Here.

1254
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:38,490
Hurry, hurry.

1255
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:41,440
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

1256
01:35:57,100 --> 01:35:57,760
Pull, pull.

1257
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:18,450
Food. Poison.

1258
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:22,410
An. Ti. Dote.

1259
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:23,810
Antidote?

1260
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:35,250
Coffins are coming

1261
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:37,180
What. Coffins?

1262
01:36:38,870 --> 01:36:40,850
Our! Coffins!

1263
01:36:41,490 --> 01:36:42,550
And who are you?

1264
01:37:13,970 --> 01:37:15,830
Poison in the food.

1265
01:37:17,170 --> 01:37:17,490
Poison in the food?

1266
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:20,760
Poison in the food.

1267
01:37:24,530 --> 01:37:26,070
But I gave her some of that food.

1268
01:37:27,350 --> 01:37:28,950
The antidote.

1269
01:37:36,630 --> 01:37:39,000
That rat bastard.

1270
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:03,180
In the wind, of the wind!

1271
01:38:49,890 --> 01:38:51,540
If you'll excuse me...

1272
01:39:44,090 --> 01:39:44,690
Master!

1273
01:39:50,130 --> 01:39:51,090
Get him.

1274
01:39:51,090 --> 01:39:52,470
To the forest!

1275
01:39:52,470 --> 01:39:53,210
Catch them!

1276
01:40:05,210 --> 01:40:06,030
It's hot!

1277
01:40:06,970 --> 01:40:07,570
It's so hot.

1278
01:40:09,090 --> 01:40:11,770
Hot...

1279
01:40:27,150 --> 01:40:28,210
Hot...

1280
01:41:12,550 --> 01:41:14,680
Did you just wipe your mouth?

1281
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:17,910
Sure. I'll let that slide.

1282
01:41:18,980 --> 01:41:21,610
Let's go find out why that bastard wants us dead.

1283
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:31,270
Wait-

1284
01:41:33,660 --> 01:41:34,630
I'll lead them away.

1285
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:40,100
There he is! Get him!

1286
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:41,930
Catch him!

1287
01:41:43,470 --> 01:41:44,680
I have to go back.

1288
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:45,750
Stay here.

1289
01:41:47,140 --> 01:41:48,130
No, you can't go.

1290
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:50,940
That woman...

1291
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:52,610
She could die.

1292
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,420
Mureuk, you could also die.

1293
01:41:58,150 --> 01:41:58,660
It's okay.

1294
01:41:59,250 --> 01:42:00,310
I'll be right back.

1295
01:42:01,090 --> 01:42:01,900
In the wind, of the wind.

1296
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:25,200
The antidote.

1297
01:42:25,830 --> 01:42:27,080
I brought the antidote.

1298
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:36,590
I'm sorry.

1299
01:42:38,090 --> 01:42:39,490
I'm the one who brought you the poison.

1300
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:41,010
I'm so sorry.

1301
01:42:42,870 --> 01:42:43,460
I'm sorry.

1302
01:42:52,230 --> 01:42:52,870
You're doing great.

1303
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:54,120
You'll be fine.

1304
01:43:38,430 --> 01:43:40,790
Bury the girl. Dump the boy in the river.

1305
01:43:43,860 --> 01:43:44,990
Prepare the kiln.

1306
01:43:45,180 --> 01:43:48,690
It's time to go back.

1307
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:08,230
[It is not known where the mysterious cloud came from...]

1308
01:44:08,230 --> 01:44:11,400
[But we are urging people to stay out of the affected areas of Seoul.]

1309
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:21,490
[Officials are trying to evaluate the threat, but there is no word yet on what can be done.]

1310
01:44:22,450 --> 01:44:23,410
What's that?

1311
01:44:24,030 --> 01:44:25,800
This is the source of our energy.

1312
01:44:26,650 --> 01:44:27,590
With the power in this knife,

1313
01:44:28,300 --> 01:44:29,540
we can catch escaped criminals...

1314
01:44:29,890 --> 01:44:31,400
We can even shift time, and see across it.

1315
01:44:32,630 --> 01:44:34,030
It isn't linear, for us.

1316
01:44:34,350 --> 01:44:35,460
It all exists at the same time.

1317
01:44:37,730 --> 01:44:38,570
When we brought you back...

1318
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:40,710
This is what we used to do it.

1319
01:44:41,510 --> 01:44:44,520
Then, if I went back, I could save people?

1320
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:45,520
That's not what I mean.

1321
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:48,170
In some sense, those people have already died.

1322
01:44:48,470 --> 01:44:51,260
And this energy has become increasingly unstable.

1323
01:44:51,260 --> 01:44:52,370
You have no idea.

1324
01:44:53,980 --> 01:44:58,250
The future I see... Is fractured. Unclear.

1325
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:33,030
Find the collector. Give him this weapon.

1326
01:45:41,990 --> 01:45:44,200
There are people here but- they're floating.

1327
01:45:44,780 --> 01:45:45,800
I said, they're floating!

1328
01:46:10,690 --> 01:46:11,540
Don't touch-

1329
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:19,010
I think I saw myself...

1330
01:46:24,450 --> 01:46:25,440
It's been too long.

1331
01:46:28,170 --> 01:46:30,430
It seems you are not restored to your full strength.

1332
01:46:31,050 --> 01:46:33,770
No, I will need to stay in this form for a little while longer.

1333
01:46:34,100 --> 01:46:38,830
I am not yet myself, I fear.

1334
01:46:40,830 --> 01:46:43,030
At least 3 ambulance workers have been lost inside the fog.

1335
01:46:43,030 --> 01:46:48,070
As you can see, it remains quite thick, so it is best to plan alternate routes for the time being.

1336
01:46:48,070 --> 01:46:51,910
In addition, drones have filmed some mysterious footage-

1337
01:47:07,410 --> 01:47:09,320
That's the red stuff from earlier, right?

1338
01:47:10,330 --> 01:47:11,700
People died.

1339
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:15,060
That was only one dose of Haava.

1340
01:47:15,910 --> 01:47:17,220
They have a lot more.

1341
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:18,530
In that ship?

1342
01:47:19,530 --> 01:47:20,460
Dad, are you hurt?

1343
01:47:22,430 --> 01:47:22,890
I'm fine.

1344
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:29,230
I have to go take care of that ship.

1345
01:47:30,380 --> 01:47:32,490
It's dangerous and I might not come back, so...

1346
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,730
I'll tell you something important.

1347
01:47:35,730 --> 01:47:36,620
About your mom.

1348
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:37,870
My mom?

1349
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:40,440
I was the one that killed her.

1350
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:43,220
Why?

1351
01:47:43,780 --> 01:47:45,880
I needed to kill the thing that was locked in her.

1352
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:49,080
And I brought you here because I needed you.

1353
01:47:50,310 --> 01:47:51,090
If I had a child...

1354
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:53,860
I could live among humans without notice.

1355
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:56,550
But now you're getting in the way.

1356
01:47:58,820 --> 01:47:59,590
So I'll ask you to leave.

1357
01:48:01,580 --> 01:48:02,420
You're lying.

1358
01:48:02,420 --> 01:48:03,590
Robots don't lie.

1359
01:48:05,570 --> 01:48:06,420
I'll go.

1360
01:48:07,210 --> 01:48:09,000
I knew you weren't human, but...

1361
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,540
Then send me back to where I came from.

1362
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:27,790
Your emergency reserves are down to 9%.

1363
01:48:28,100 --> 01:48:29,080
If I leave, your survival rate-

1364
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:30,500
I'm aware. Stop talking.

1365
01:48:33,060 --> 01:48:34,120
Yian, wait outside for a moment.

1366
01:48:34,120 --> 01:48:35,110
Thunder-

1367
01:48:35,110 --> 01:48:37,000
Take her to Minsung's house. I know.

1368
01:49:03,910 --> 01:49:05,590
What did you write on the picture?

1369
01:49:08,870 --> 01:49:10,670
[Run away, dummy.]

1370
01:49:17,090 --> 01:49:17,610
Thunder.

1371
01:49:17,610 --> 01:49:19,510
Deliver my final message for me.

1372
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:25,180
We were wrong. To use humans like this.

1373
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:29,650
But Guards can never run away.

1374
01:49:29,650 --> 01:49:31,730
So even if I don't have the reserves to win this fight...

1375
01:49:32,300 --> 01:49:33,490
I must follow my program.

1376
01:49:34,090 --> 01:49:35,670
Reserves? What does that mean?

1377
01:49:36,630 --> 01:49:37,520
It's how much life he has left.

1378
01:49:38,530 --> 01:49:39,530
He's running out, little by little.

1379
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:42,140
Right now... reserves are at 8%.

1380
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:45,090
Odds of survival...

1381
01:49:45,290 --> 01:49:46,010
1%.

1382
01:50:42,290 --> 01:50:43,770
Thunder, we have to go back.

1383
01:50:44,110 --> 01:50:44,610
I can't.

1384
01:50:45,330 --> 01:50:47,010
I have to take you to safety.

1385
01:50:47,380 --> 01:50:48,420
Dad needs you.

1386
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:49,840
Turn the car around.

1387
01:50:50,220 --> 01:50:51,360
There's no way you can help him.

1388
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:53,480
Maybe, but my heart says we have to try.

1389
01:50:54,310 --> 01:50:55,690
Let's go back to Dad.

1390
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:11,960
So where is this bastard?

1391
01:51:11,960 --> 01:51:14,070
The alarm has been turned on.

1392
01:51:15,060 --> 01:51:17,080
We should finish this and go.

1393
01:51:29,750 --> 01:51:30,630
Your heart?

1394
01:51:31,150 --> 01:51:31,530
Yes.

1395
01:51:43,610 --> 01:51:44,630
Human hearts are really amazing.

1396
01:51:44,630 --> 01:51:45,810
Why?

1397
01:51:46,190 --> 01:51:47,230
Odds of battle success...

1398
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:48,640
2%.

1399
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:49,480
3%.

1400
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:50,890
Now 4%.

1401
01:52:02,340 --> 01:52:03,610
Prepare deployment.

1402
01:52:06,900 --> 01:52:08,730
Calibrations complete.

1403
01:52:17,300 --> 01:52:18,230
We're almost there.

1404
01:52:18,380 --> 01:52:19,660
Why are you coming back?

1405
01:52:19,660 --> 01:52:20,840
That ship has a weakness...

1406
01:52:21,380 --> 01:52:22,980
The connection between the inner and outer systems...

1407
01:52:22,980 --> 01:52:24,690
That red heart, remember?

1408
01:52:27,250 --> 01:52:28,500
Who are you talking to?

1409
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:29,990
I'll get the knife to you.

1410
01:52:29,990 --> 01:52:30,600
Get it into the heart.

1411
01:52:31,110 --> 01:52:32,050
Moving now.

1412
01:52:39,870 --> 01:52:40,410
Got it!

1413
01:53:14,580 --> 01:53:15,710
So you're the one who's been chasing us.

1414
01:53:16,780 --> 01:53:18,530
Living here all this time..

1415
01:53:19,530 --> 01:53:20,890
Even raising one of their children.

1416
01:53:26,860 --> 01:53:27,640
Dad!

1417
01:53:45,450 --> 01:53:46,570
Let's get out of here, Dad.

1418
01:53:46,570 --> 01:53:47,880
Why did you come back?

1419
01:53:54,640 --> 01:53:55,710
Thunder, are you listening?

1420
01:53:56,660 --> 01:53:57,480
Where is it?

1421
01:54:33,460 --> 01:54:34,030
Dad!

1422
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:44,250
They're coming!

1423
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:46,340
We can't stop them.

1424
01:54:46,340 --> 01:54:47,950
They're just going to keep chasing us.

1425
01:54:52,370 --> 01:54:52,820
Dad!

1426
01:54:52,820 --> 01:54:53,770
He's on the car!

1427
01:55:00,140 --> 01:55:02,630
We have to stop them before they can release the rest of the Haava!

1428
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:04,420
Let's switch times.

1429
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:05,930
Ready, set...

1430
01:55:06,310 --> 01:55:06,660
Go!

1431
01:55:21,160 --> 01:55:22,690
So this was his room...

1432
01:55:26,280 --> 01:55:27,370
And his clothes?

1433
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:32,680
Does this... look like a record of time to you?

1434
01:55:33,220 --> 01:55:35,310
If it's a calendar, it must be about 3600 days.

1435
01:55:35,530 --> 01:55:36,610
What's he been doing?

1436
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:37,890
Is he waiting for something?

1437
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:43,560
Jungmoon, Heuksol... That's us.

1438
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:48,070
That's the magistrate, and that's Dogshit...

1439
01:55:54,440 --> 01:55:57,400
Look here. He destroyed something.

1440
01:55:57,950 --> 01:56:00,340
Goryeo Year Six, Hwangnyon Province.

1441
01:56:00,340 --> 01:56:01,890
This is a record from ten years ago.

1442
01:56:04,040 --> 01:56:08,380
The heavens opened. A strange carriage, pulling humans behind it, fell from the sky.

1443
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:11,940
I saw it with the magistrate, who was hunting nearby...

1444
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:16,380
And the dual mages of Mount Samgak.

1445
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:18,310
We're in the book.

1446
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:30,690
10 YEARS AGO

1447
01:56:30,990 --> 01:56:31,810
What is that?

1448
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:33,630
They've come through some sort of portal.

1449
01:56:33,880 --> 01:56:34,390
Investigate it.

1450
01:56:35,390 --> 01:56:36,170
Wait here.

1451
01:56:38,460 --> 01:56:39,110
I'll report back.

1452
01:56:44,050 --> 01:56:45,680
My lord, my lord!

1453
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:46,830
What on earth is happening?

1454
01:56:47,970 --> 01:56:49,200
It's dangerous! Stay back!

1455
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:50,290
But it's right by our house!

1456
01:57:03,530 --> 01:57:04,990
Thunder!

1457
01:57:16,360 --> 01:57:17,530
We lost them. Let's get back, Thunder.

1458
01:57:18,530 --> 01:57:20,650
Gotta... get back...

1459
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:21,380
Thunder-

1460
01:57:22,340 --> 01:57:22,890
Thunder!

1461
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:32,030
Stay in the car.

1462
01:57:47,350 --> 01:57:48,550
Dad!

1463
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:50,290
Thunder, take her back!

1464
01:57:53,630 --> 01:57:54,620
Do it now!

1465
01:57:56,620 --> 01:57:57,300
Thunder!

1466
01:57:57,620 --> 01:57:58,390
Thunder!

1467
01:58:14,330 --> 01:58:15,520
Dad!

1468
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:23,640
Odds of victory: 10%...

1469
01:58:23,640 --> 01:58:24,290
15%.

1470
01:58:24,750 --> 01:58:25,440
17%.

1471
01:58:26,330 --> 01:58:27,120
Why is it increasing?

1472
01:58:29,130 --> 01:58:30,150
I'm dying...

1473
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:40,970
Yian will do it.

1474
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:46,780
With another human. I can see it now.

1475
01:59:02,780 --> 01:59:04,860
The door has closed.

1476
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:30,010
Yian...

1477
01:59:30,010 --> 01:59:31,850
You have to find me again!

1478
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:33,610
We can fix this!

1479
01:59:36,390 --> 01:59:37,730
I need another body...

1480
01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:41,320
Human...

1481
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:44,170
I must find a human!

1482
02:00:25,370 --> 02:00:26,020
You're awake!

1483
02:00:26,400 --> 02:00:27,440
Where are you from?

1484
02:00:27,740 --> 02:00:28,550
Your clothes are strange!

1485
02:00:30,550 --> 02:00:31,200
Thunder!

1486
02:00:31,700 --> 02:00:32,260
Thunder!

1487
02:00:33,510 --> 02:00:35,470
Energy - I can't lose the -

1488
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:37,480
Did you see a thing that looks like a knife?

1489
02:00:39,590 --> 02:00:40,010
A knife?

1490
02:00:41,060 --> 02:00:42,280
Is it something important?

1491
02:00:43,240 --> 02:00:44,200
I'll go look for it.

1492
02:00:44,770 --> 02:00:45,720
Stay here.

1493
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:48,010
Who...

1494
02:01:50,250 --> 02:01:51,680
It can't be... me...

1495
02:01:52,740 --> 02:01:53,890
Why am I there?

1496
02:01:55,270 --> 02:01:56,290
Is this a dream?

1497
02:02:05,990 --> 02:02:07,450
I remember this.

1498
02:02:08,310 --> 02:02:10,390
I found a girl on the riverbank.

1499
02:02:11,920 --> 02:02:14,700
She asked me to find a knife.

1500
02:02:28,130 --> 02:02:29,670
How am I still alive?

1501
02:02:40,580 --> 02:02:42,550
Have you ever put your hand...

1502
02:02:42,980 --> 02:02:45,890
into the mist rising from a waterfall?

1503
02:03:12,650 --> 02:03:13,310
She's not-

1504
02:03:18,700 --> 02:03:19,650
Where are they?

1505
02:04:11,260 --> 02:04:12,390
Our turn.

1506
02:04:33,090 --> 02:04:35,300
You are sleepy.

1507
02:04:35,300 --> 02:04:37,570
Don't you want to lay down?

1508
02:04:38,420 --> 02:04:41,960
Your body is heavy... Your eyes are closing...

1509
02:05:33,560 --> 02:05:34,880
Freeze.

1510
02:05:42,060 --> 02:05:44,870
Should have bought it when we offered it, you bastard.

1511
02:05:49,560 --> 02:05:51,530
Rub your eyes if you want to go blind.

1512
02:05:53,180 --> 02:05:53,880
And next...

1513
02:05:58,040 --> 02:05:59,860
We are pleased to introduce...

1514
02:06:00,230 --> 02:06:02,370
Something else you should have bought.

1515
02:06:02,370 --> 02:06:04,090
Our newest product!

1516
02:06:36,180 --> 02:06:37,700
Soorisoori-ma, soorisoori-ma.

1517
02:06:37,700 --> 02:06:41,860
Soorisoori-ma-ha, soorisoori-ma-ha.

1518
02:07:02,450 --> 02:07:03,000
Is that -

1519
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:03,910
It's the magistrate's sword.

1520
02:07:26,270 --> 02:07:29,700
Well, how about that. The antidote worked.

1521
02:07:31,880 --> 02:07:33,300
You're not dead! Are you okay?

1522
02:07:33,300 --> 02:07:34,690
Seems you don't know Dosa.

1523
02:07:36,360 --> 02:07:38,110
I'll finish this one off.

1524
02:07:38,310 --> 02:07:40,510
Be careful.
These bastards can even enter your body.

1525
02:07:40,780 --> 02:07:41,710
Just buy some time.

1526
02:07:41,710 --> 02:07:42,950
Hmm. I can do that.

1527
02:07:44,900 --> 02:07:47,750
Ah. I remembered where we met befo-

1528
02:07:52,260 --> 02:07:56,580
This is an excellent new product. We did well.

1529
02:07:57,410 --> 02:07:58,860
She's still alive.

1530
02:07:59,710 --> 02:08:01,030
That's great.

1531
02:08:06,090 --> 02:08:06,810
Why am I -

1532
02:08:08,020 --> 02:08:09,530
I'm feeling her pain like it was my own.

1533
02:08:10,920 --> 02:08:12,090
Because that's Suyang's daughter.

1534
02:08:14,410 --> 02:08:15,570
Hey, kid.

1535
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:17,860
Put this medicine on your injuries.

1536
02:08:18,070 --> 02:08:18,430
Catch.

1537
02:08:19,890 --> 02:08:21,710
I'm sharing because
it seems like we're on the same side.

1538
02:08:22,660 --> 02:08:23,680
I'm sorry about before.

1539
02:08:24,230 --> 02:08:25,230
I'm sure you are.

1540
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:28,200
I'm Heuksol, of the Mount Samgak mages.

1541
02:08:29,250 --> 02:08:30,250
I'm Yian.

1542
02:08:30,580 --> 02:08:31,690
What an unusual name.

1543
02:08:37,380 --> 02:08:38,340
In the wind, of the wind.

1544
02:08:40,820 --> 02:08:42,020
Finally.

1545
02:09:57,220 --> 02:09:57,630
Help her!

1546
02:09:58,740 --> 02:09:59,880
I'll hold him here!

1547
02:10:00,490 --> 02:10:01,850
This looks like a job for me!

1548
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:47,860
Hot.

1549
02:10:49,630 --> 02:10:51,100
Very hot.

1550
02:11:08,490 --> 02:11:09,450
Heuk-sol!

1551
02:12:06,480 --> 02:12:08,060
How did he get that sword?

1552
02:12:19,750 --> 02:12:21,070
Yian!

1553
02:12:21,070 --> 02:12:22,050
Shoot, shoot!

1554
02:12:23,010 --> 02:12:25,590
Into that mirror, there!

1555
02:12:25,590 --> 02:12:26,950
Shoot!

1556
02:13:13,010 --> 02:13:14,280
He's breaking free!

1557
02:13:14,280 --> 02:13:15,850
Hold him!

1558
02:14:01,300 --> 02:14:03,140
Hey. I'm the one you're looking for.

1559
02:14:13,160 --> 02:14:14,950
Right Paw, Left Paw! Go with the girl!

1560
02:14:51,860 --> 02:14:53,540
Done. Your five minutes are up.

1561
02:16:12,840 --> 02:16:15,500
There's something...

1562
02:16:15,500 --> 02:16:17,860
Got it... Inside you...

1563
02:16:18,370 --> 02:16:18,770
What did you say?

1564
02:16:19,560 --> 02:16:23,140
In you... there's something...

1565
02:16:23,140 --> 02:16:24,310
What's inside me?

1566
02:16:25,090 --> 02:16:26,800
In you...

1567
02:16:28,170 --> 02:16:30,800
That... That... That thing...

1568
02:16:31,300 --> 02:16:33,300
In you...

1569
02:16:34,660 --> 02:16:35,930
What are you sayi-

1570
02:16:56,290 --> 02:16:57,510
I didn't find any knives...

1571
02:16:58,270 --> 02:16:59,300
But is this yours?

1572
02:16:59,590 --> 02:17:00,040
Yes.

1573
02:17:04,960 --> 02:17:06,750
What's your name? I'm Mureuk.

1574
02:17:07,330 --> 02:17:08,240
Yian.

1575
02:17:08,610 --> 02:17:09,320
Yian.

1576
02:17:10,760 --> 02:17:11,620
Yian.

1577
02:17:13,690 --> 02:17:14,340
What is it?

1578
02:17:17,660 --> 02:17:19,070
There might be something dangerous out there.

1579
02:17:19,350 --> 02:17:20,200
I'll go take a look.

1580
02:17:20,530 --> 02:17:21,060
No!

1581
02:17:21,610 --> 02:17:22,660
Don't worry.

1582
02:17:22,660 --> 02:17:24,070
I'm very sturdy.

1583
02:18:00,070 --> 02:18:00,890
Found one...

1584
02:18:01,820 --> 02:18:02,780
A human...

1585
02:18:20,380 --> 02:18:20,970
Heuk-seul... Earlier...

1586
02:18:22,580 --> 02:18:25,520
There were four names hanging up.

1587
02:18:27,020 --> 02:18:28,540
But it wasn't all of us.

1588
02:18:29,690 --> 02:18:30,680
Not four.

1589
02:18:31,690 --> 02:18:32,660
Five of us saw them.

1590
02:18:33,080 --> 02:18:33,660
Then...

1591
02:18:36,440 --> 02:18:38,040
So the last one they needed to find...

1592
02:18:41,250 --> 02:18:42,020
He has the powers of a Dosa...

1593
02:18:43,210 --> 02:18:45,230
And one of those monsters inside him.

1594
02:18:46,010 --> 02:18:47,110
Do we have to kill him, then?

1595
02:19:33,480 --> 02:19:35,940
We have to stop them before they can release the rest of the Haava!

1596
02:19:38,740 --> 02:19:39,590
We have to act fast!

1597
02:19:40,400 --> 02:19:41,410
Let's switch times.

1598
02:19:46,460 --> 02:19:46,900
What is that?

1599
02:20:04,130 --> 02:20:06,250
48 minutes left until detonation.

1600
02:20:06,660 --> 02:20:08,430
The controller is awakened.

1601
02:20:08,980 --> 02:20:10,940
Freedom is coming.

1602
02:20:11,320 --> 02:20:11,840
The time...

1603
02:20:12,210 --> 02:20:12,840
is now.

1604
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:53,000
- subbed by M
