00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,640
很长很长一段时间，

外星人把他们的罪犯关在人体内。

可以随意进出人类的外星人

被称为帕罗。

天开了……

有人员伤亡。

16
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,580
囚犯正在接近。

17
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,200
别担心。

00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,070
我安然无恙。

我没有问。

20
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,900
它要回到自己的身体里了!

21
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,240
开始提取。

00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,760
我不是最后一个。

24
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,600
你保护的混蛋,

一个婴儿!

我们不介入人类事务。
We don't get involved in human affairs.

32
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,290
我听说。“对不起，但我们不参与。”
I've heard that. 'I'm sorry, but we don't get involved.'

33
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,130
坚持下去。
Hang on.

34
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,460
我要开枪!
I have to shoot it!

35
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,980
你是说射击吗?一个婴儿?
Did you say shoot? A baby?

36
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,380
不!
No!

37
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,860

犯罪中。

Wait, we're not taking the baby? It could die!

40
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,330
没有干扰。你不明白吗?
No interference. Can't you understand that?

41
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,250
不,来吧。
No, c'mon.

42
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,660
我们不想要个孩子吗?
Don't we want a baby?

43
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,910
你为什么每次都这么做?
Why do you do this every time?

44
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:00,460
为什么?
Why?

45
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,240
害怕它会取代我?
Scared it'll take after me?

46
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,480
等一下。
Wait a minute.

47
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,230
宝宝……在未来…
The baby... in the future...

48
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,540
别告诉我她出现在你的幻象里。
Don't tell me she's in one of your visions.

49
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,900
我们走吧。门正在关上。
Let's go. The door is closing.

50
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,960
那我想我们得回去了。
Then I guess we've got to get back.

51
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,840
你能做什么?
What can you do?

52
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,250
你为什么坐在后面?
Why are you sitting back there?

53
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,760
啊，我这样太高了，对吧?
Ah, I'm too tall like this, right?

54
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:27,660
现在离开!
Now departing!

55
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:58,190
这些外星囚犯跨越时空存在过，
These alien prisoners have existed across time and across space,

56
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,110
守卫和雷霆的工作就是管理他们。
and it was Guard and Thunder's job to manage them.

57
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,880
到目前为止，有七名帕罗逃脱，

58
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,020

59
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,570
但那天有点不同。
But that day was a little different.

60
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,530
什么?
What?

61
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,020
这是什么?
What is this?

62
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,520
对吧?这里怎么会有个婴儿?
Right? Why would there be a baby here?

63
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,480
我说，这是什么?
I said, what is this?

64
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,300
最重要的是-那个-
The most important thing is that- That-

65
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,670
问题是-是-
See, the thing is- Is-

66
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,140
这是- - - - - -

67
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:47,740
你要去哪里?
Where do you think you're going?

68
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,140
不,我不是
No, I'm not-

69
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,390
我为什么要去别的地方?
Why would I be going anywhere?

70
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,340
你为什么把它带来这里?
Why did you bring it here?

71
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,760
看来我们得把它放回去了。
Looks like we'll have to put it back.

72
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,940
还是……我们应该杀死它吗?
Or... should we kill it?

73
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,850
杀了它吗?你为什么不把它留下?
Kill it? Why didn't you just leave it?

74
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,770
啊，我为什么要这么做?
Ah, why have I done this?

75
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,490
啊哈。
Aha.

76
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,600
我提议做个实验!
I propose an experiment!

77
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,440
如果我们检查它的大脑是不是很疯狂…
Wouldn't it be so wild if we examined its brain...

78
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,870
对人类有了更多的了解?
and learned more about humans?

79
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,130
然后……
So then...

80
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,470
首先,我们应该……
First, we should...

81
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:15,950
第一位?什么?
First? What?

82
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,670
．.． 把它带回家?

83
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,120
我吗?

84
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,130
是的!

Primary ingredient is lactose lipoprotein. Substitute formulas are sold in shops.

88
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,850
我们要检查宝宝的大脑吗?
Well, shall we examine the baby's brain?

89
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,580
为什么不呢?我们用完就可以扔掉了。
Why not? We can just discard it when we're done.

90
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,580
正确的。当然。
Right. Of course.

91

准备传播。

分析正在进行中的地球社会。

在某些情况下，人类的大脑可以拒绝我们植入的记忆。
There are cases where human minds can reject our implanted memories.

95
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,810
很有可能人类比我们预期的要复杂得多。
There is a high possibility that humans are more complicated than we anticipated.

96
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:06,130
嘿。
Hey.

97
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,510
我们还要在这里待多久?

00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:39,640
你曾把手伸进瀑布升起的水雾中吗?
Have you ever put your hand into the mist rising from a waterfall?

105
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,990
啊，所以就像……你能闻到水的味道吗?
Ah, so it's like... you can smell the water?

106
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:43,630
嗯。
Hm.

107
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,990
这是无稽之谈。
That's nonsense.

108
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,600
就像我说的，当你把手伸进雾里，
As I was saying, when you put your hand in the mist,

109
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,620
哪里是空气的尽头，哪里是水的起点?雾和你的手成为一体。
where does the air end and the water begin? The mist and your hand become one entity.

110
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,540
的主人。
Master.

111
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,660
我们来演示一下。
Let's have a demonstration.

112
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,260
这不是一个人能真正证明的事情，但是…
It's not something that one can really demonstrate but...

113
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,880
随着古老的Dosa艺术，

I don't want to disappoint the people who came out to see the cherry blossoms...

116
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,390
但我也不能让我的顾客失望。
but I can't disappoint my customers either.

117
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:25,100
当你像我一样先进时，你对任何伤害都免疫。
And when you are as advanced as I, you are immune to injury of any kind.

118
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,610
任何形式的吗?
Of any kind?

119
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,590
是的。
Yes.

120
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,550
在这里。拿着这个，就在这里
Here. Take that, and right here-

121
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,890
那我可以这么做了?
So I can do this, then?

122
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,730
刀? ?
A knife??

123
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,890
你都没有犹豫，你就
You didn't even hesitate, you just-

124
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,710
手帕。汉-汉
Handkerchief. Han- Han-

125
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,210
我要把它拿出来!
I'll take it out!

126
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:44,900
不,不,
No, dont-

127
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:46,970
我说,不!
I said, don't!

128
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,200
它很好。
It's fine.

129
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,200
紧急!村子里有贼!
Emergency! Thieves in the village!

130
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,180
嘿!你是说镇上有赏金猎人吗?
Hey! Did you say there were bounty hunters in town?

131
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,370
在这里!在这里!
Over here! Over here!

132
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,090
他会为你抓住它们的!
He'll catch them for you!

133
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,520
这些是男人吗?
Are these the men?

134
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,860
哦,是的!
Oh, yes!

135
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,730
让我们开始工作吧。我们去抓小偷吧?
Let's get to work. Shall we catch some thieves?

136

三个人在跑步。

137
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,580
有一个钟。
There's a bell.

138
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,050
附近有神社吗?
Are there shrines nearby?

139
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,050
这种方式!
That way!

140
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,760
你在逃避什么?
What are you running from?

141
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,280
善良。就因为它在那里，并不意味着你可以偷走它。
Goodness. Just because it's there, doesn't mean you can steal it.

142
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,020
想想你的下辈子。那你也想这样生活吗?
Think of your next life. Do you want to live like this then, too?

143
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:44,790
我希望你们能从中吸取教训，成为对社会有贡献的一员。
I hope you can learn from this and become a productive member of society.

144
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:48,420
那是什么?
What was that?

145
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:52,030
那么。看来我们要去填满一笔赏金了。
Well then. Looks like we're about to fill a bounty.

146
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,020
看，是那个养猫的Mureuk。
Oh look, it's that Mureuk guy with the cats.

147
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,530
放下你的东西!
Lay down your goods!

148
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:00,260
在这个美好的日子里，我们要伸张正义。
We will be enacting justice on this beautiful day.

149
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,930
制定正义是谁?
Who's enacting justice?

150
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,680
我都已经在这了，你说要拿赏金是什么意思
What are you saying about filling bounties when I'm already here and-

151
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,010
不，拜托，谁先找到赏金谁就有权利，对吧?
No, come on now, whoever gets their sights on a bounty first has dibs right?

152
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:15,200
不是这样吗?
Isn't that so?

153
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
我有权要求这个-
I have a claim to thi-

154
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,990
把自己捆好。现在。
Tie yourselves up properly. Now.

155
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,540
前提是你想让你的耳膜完好无损。
That is, if you want your eardrums intact.

156
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,190
你们从哪里来的?
Where did you guys come from, anyway?

157
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:41,990
啊,?
Aw, again?

158
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,220
我告诉你，这赏金是我的。
I'm telling you, this bounty is mine.

159
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,700
在风中，在风中。
In the wind, of the wind.

160
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,700
你来了。
Out you come.

161
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,780
是这样的吗?
Was it like this?

162
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,960
你是在模仿江原的古老传统吗?如果你学了一百年，你不可能
You presume to imitate Gangwon's ancient traditions? If you studied for a hundred years, you couldn't-

163
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,460
悬赏三贼，成功填满。
Bounty for three thieves, successfully filled.

164
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,450
嘿Mureuk !
Hey Mureuk!

165
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,320
看一看新上市的产品!
Take a look at the new listings!

166
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,240
让我们看看…
Let's see...

167
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,390
我们下一个要抓什么样的混蛋?
What kind of bastard should we catch next?

168
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,760
肯定有人要出高价。
Definitely someone going for a high price.

169
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,220
真是一群笨蛋。
What a bunch of louts.

170
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,090
看看这个。
Look at this one here.

171
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,860
这是一个生来就是罪犯的女人的脸。
That's the face of a woman born to be a criminal.

172
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,070
50公益诉讼?
50 pil?

173
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,600
二十多岁
Twenty-

174
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,630
不，200 -等等，不
No, two hundred- Wait no-

175
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,360
二千公益诉讼?
Two thousand pil?

176
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,380
等等，我在b-的地方见过
Wait, I've seen this somewhere b-

177
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,710
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

178
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,410
你又头痛了吗?
Do you have another headache?

179
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,260
这个描述太生动了，真的让我觉得我亲眼见过。
This description is just so vivid, it really makes me feel like I've seen it myself.

180
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,260
啊,那个。
Ah, that one.

181
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,590
你知道现在谁在公共场合酗酒，对吧?
And you know who's in for public intoxication right now, right?

182
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,200
我们开始吧~
Here we go~

183
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,100
我要去看狗屎。
Gotta go see Dogturd.

184
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,000
主人，你知道狗屎在哪儿吗?
Do you know where Dogturd is, Master?

185
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,430
也许值得谈一谈。
Might be worth talking to.

186
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,390
你不担心。
Don't you worry.

187
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,760
我很了解狗屎。
I know Dogturd well.

188
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,460
Aigoo,我的主。
Aigoo, my lord.

189
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,080
这个可怜的混蛋来见他亲爱的父亲，狗屎。
This poor bastard has come to see his beloved father, Dogturd.

190
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,650
欢迎的人。
Greet the man.

191
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,810
他可怜的父亲要把自己喝死。
His poor father is going to drink himself to death.

192
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:08,180
啊,这是什么?
Ah, what's this?

193
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,610
是我们尊敬的礼物。
A gift of our esteem.

194
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,390
请喝一口，先生。
Have just a sip, sir.

195
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,400
哦，看起来是很好的东西……
Oh, it looks like very fine stuff...

196
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:16,610
如此甜美!
So sweet!

197
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:17,520
过瘾!
Hits the spot!

198
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,060
既然你把这个带来了，你可以在走之前给你父亲喝一杯。
Since you brought this here, you can take a cup in to your father before you go.

199
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,050
我可以吗?
Can I?

200
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,790
你的好意一定会得到回报的。
Your kindness will surely be rewarded.

201
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,200
你儿子来看你了!
Your son is here to see you!

202
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
他一直在哭。
He's crying and everything.

203
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,180
我有个儿子?
I have a son?

204
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,930
父亲……
Father...

205
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,800
你儿子穆鲁克来见你了。
Your son Mureuk is here to see you.

206
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,340
Mureuk，你这个混蛋
Mureuk, you bastard -

207
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,060
你应该羞于在我面前露面，你这个偷东西的混蛋!
You should be ashamed to show your face around me, you thieving bastard!

208
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,880
你再多说一个字，我就
If you say another word, I'll -

209
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,970
他见到他是多么高兴啊!这样的欢迎!
That's how happy he is to see him! Such a welcome!

210
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,340
你说得太伤人了，神父。
That's a lot of hurtful words, Father.

211
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,380
关于这个你能告诉我些什么?
What can you tell me about this?

212
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,320
你觉得我会告诉你吗?
Do you think I'd tell you?

213
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,600
即使我信任你，你也不能给我足够的条件让我开口。
Even if I trusted you, you couldn't offer me enough to get me to talk.

214
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,260
在我杀了你之前滚出去!
Get out of here before I kill you!

215
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,540
那我猜我父亲不想要这把钥匙。
Then I guess my Father doesn't want this key.

216
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,740
啊，我亲爱的儿子!
Oh, my beloved son!

217
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,660
来看望他生病的父亲……
Come to his ailing father...

218
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,050
跟我说说这把刀。
Tell me about the knife.

219
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,030
我来告诉你我知道的。
I'll tell you what I know.

220
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,300
8月5日，在黄岭山附近的渔网中出现了一把奇怪的刀。
On August fifth, a strange knife came up in a net near Mount Hwangnyeong.

221
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,100
它的刀刃上镶嵌着一颗奇怪的宝石。
It had a strange jewel for a blade.

222
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,930
起初，他们想卖掉珠宝……
At first, they had thoughts of selling the jewel...

223
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:42,290
但即使是铁匠也无法将它与剑柄分开。
But even the blacksmith couldn't separate it from the hilt.

224
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,140
当刀反弹到人群中时，它击中了一名男子，本应杀死他。
When the knife ricocheted into the crowd, it struck a man and should have killed him...

225
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,900
但他站了起来，好像毫发无伤!
But he got up as if he was unharmed!

226
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,810
这肯定是一件珍贵的文物，必须加以保护!
Surely this is a precious artifact that must be protected!

227
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,100
你不觉得吗?
Don't you think?

228
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,230
那现在谁拿着刀?
Then who has the knife now?

229
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,370
这是-
Well, that's -

230
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:10,510
这是很久以前一位黄陵县长买的。
It was bought by a man who was a Hwangneung magistrate a long time ago.

231
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,400
但现在，它属于一个在启城的男人。
But nowadays, it belongs to a man in Gyeseong.

232
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:17,570
他经营着一个叫碧南亭的地方。
He runs a place called Byeoknanjung.

233
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,500
啊，这太令人兴奋了。
Ah, this is all very exciting.

234
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,040
你儿子现在可以自己出去了。
Your son will see himself out now.

235
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,210
小心些而已。
Be careful.

236
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,530
他是全国最好的Dosa。
That man is the best Dosa in the country.

237
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:28,080
说实话，一个前地方法官能做多好的Dosa ?
How good a Dosa could an ex-magistrate be, honestly?

238
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:33,270
哦，我的父亲，如果你能改变你的方式…
Oh, my father, if only you could change your ways...

239
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,750
你已经很久没有和另一个Dosa对抗了。
It's been a long time since you've gone up against another Dosa.

240
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,500
我不知道你能不能比得上他。
I wonder if you'll be a match for him.

241
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,200
我可能缺乏正规训练
I may lack in formal training,

242
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,730
但我有工作经验。每一天!
but I've got on-the-job experience. Every day!

243
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,050
实用知识胜过书本知识。每个人都知道。
Practical knowledge beats book learning. Everyone knows that.

244
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,850
我看起来像不像上流社会的人?
Don't I look like a man at the top of the game?

245
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,110
上面-你真的这么想吗?
The top- Do you really think that?

246
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,570
毕竟，你是那个粉丝的合法主人!
After all, you're the rightful owner of that fan!

247
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,720
不是吗?你怎么什么都没说?
Aren't you? Why didn't you say anything?

248
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,020
我们跟踪你是因为你说你是风扇的主人。
We're only following you because you said you were the owner of the fan.

249
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,890
仔细想想，你还没拔出那把大剑呢。
Come to think of it, you've still never drawn the great sword.

250
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,080
你以为我不会拔剑吗?嗯?
You think I can't draw the sword? Huh?

251
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,850
你是这么想的吗?
Is that what you think?

252
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:07,180
我要拔出剑，然后你们都会后悔的!
I'm gonna draw the sword and then you're all gonna be sorry!

253
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,180
我真的在做!
I'm really doing it!

254
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:09,630
在这里,我们走吧!
Here we go!

255
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:11,690
他真的做到了!
He's really doing it!

256
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,060
今天的一天!
Today's the day!

257
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,060
在风中，在风中。
In the wind, of the wind.

258
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,730
你看到了吗?你看到了吗?
You see this? You see it?

259
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,530
似乎沉重。
Seems heavy.

260
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,890
下一个时间。
Next time.

261
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:30,600
周围人太多了。
Too many people around.

262
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,620
这是正确的。不想吓到任何人。
That's right. Don't wanna startle anyone.

263
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,830
我越来越怀疑你不是我们真正的主人。
I'm becoming more and more suspicious that you aren't actually our rightful owner.

264
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,690
如果你还这么顶嘴，我就把你变回猫。
If you're going to talk back this much, I'll just turn you back into a cat.

265
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,360
别这样。让我们人类。
Don't be like that. Leave us human.

266
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,390
人类是谁?
Who's human?

267
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,220
坐下来。
Sit down.

268
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:42,910
我们快喝一杯吧。
Let's have a quick drink.

269
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,510
我们要点菜，女士!
We'd like to order, ma'am!

270
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,360
在我看来，无论如何你都会占地方法官的上风!
The way I see it, you'll get the upper hand on the magistrate no matter what!

271
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,180
女士，碧南亭在哪里?
Ma'am, where is Byeoknanjung from here?

272
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:51,940
走那条路，它就在前面。
Go that way and it's straight ahead.

273
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:57,650
那是谁?
Who's that?

274
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,420
我以前从没见过这样的衣服。
I've never seen clothes like that before.

275
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,340
对吧?
Right?

276
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,180
(BYEOKNANJUNG)
[BYEOKNANJUNG]

277
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,080
我什么都能干!
I'm good for anything!

278
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:18,340
他得到它!
He got it!

279
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,730
我能和你们两位谈谈吗?
Can I speak with you gents for a moment?

280
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:27,050
我听说这里有个人曾经是地方法官。
I heard there was a man here who used to be a magistrate.

281
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,550
你认识他吗?
Do you know him?

282
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:31,140
我听说过那个风扇。你可以给它出个价。
I've heard of that fan. You can name your price for it.

283
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,750
这个啊?
Ah this?

284
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,250
这是一个传家宝。这对我来说是无价的。
It's an heirloom. It's priceless to me.

285
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,620
很多人在这里吃饭……
Lot of people eating here...

286
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,360
偷来的东西怎么可能是传家宝?
How can something be an heirloom if you stole it?

287
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,180
像一个懦夫。
Like a coward.

288
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,820
你该庆幸我能对长辈好点。
You're lucky I have to be nice to my elders.

289
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,370
你不能随便指责别人偷东西!
You can't just go around accusing people of stealing things!

290
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:46,820
嘿,你这个混蛋!
Hey, you bastard!

291
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,700
我们不允许你们这种人进来!
We don't allow your kind in here!

292
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,370
法官……
The magistrate...

293
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,370
不要在室内，谢谢。
None of that indoors, thank you.

294
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,610
这不是体力的问题，这是意志力的问题。
This isn't about physical strength, this is about force of will.

295
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,450
你不能想，所以你不能做。
You can't think it, so you can't do it.

296
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,370
什么是废话?
What nonsense is -

297
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,140
你认识我吗?
Do you know me?

298
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,910
我了解你这样的人。
I know men like you.

299
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:21,690
停止追逐赏金，诚实地生活。
Stop chasing after bounties and live honestly.

300
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,800
你们可以回去吃饭了，先生们。
You can get back to your meals, gentlemen.

301
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,240
帮我……
Help me...

302
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,280
的帮助!
Help!

303
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,710
我们的客人到了吗?
Has our guest arrived?

304
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,620
是的。还有你要的信息。
Yes. And the information you asked for.

305
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,760
为什么这么难?
Why is this so difficult?

306
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,660
他的名字没有列出来。
His name isn't listed.

307
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,450
你说你知道这是什么。
You said you know what this is.

308
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,800
我当然知道。
Of course I know.

309
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,810
你是怎么知道的?
How did you learn of it?

310
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,290
因为它是我们的。
Because it's ours.

311
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:06,540
我们的吗?
Ours?

312
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,110
是的。
Yep.

313
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:09,250
那是谁?
And who is that?

314
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:14,980
裁判官去哪儿了?
Where did the magistrate go?

315
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,350
法官吗?他在楼上。
The magistrate? He's upstairs.

316
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,670
他好像认识你。
It seemed like he knew you.

317
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,750
我吗?我这辈子都没见过他。
Me? I've never seen the man in my life.

318
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,080
你看到他了吗?看起来像狗屎。
Do you see him? That looks like Dogturd.

319
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,820
Dogturd吗?
Dogturd?

320
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,210
你是对的。我能闻到他的味道。
You're right. Ugh, I can smell him.

321
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,620
他一定是在找那把刀。
He must be after the knife.

322
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,150
在风中，在风中。
In the wind, of the wind.

323
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,620
在风中，在风中。
In the wind, of the wind.

324
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,650
在。的。风。的。的。风!
In. The. Wind. Of. The. Wind!

325
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,670
你疼吗?
Are you hurt?

326
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,990
这把刀……不要醒来…
The knife... Don't awaken...

327
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:21,860
不,
Don't -

328
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,800
你在做什么
What do you m-

329
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,740
我想狗屎把它偷走了!
I think Dogturd's stolen it!

330
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,500
我看你在这儿吃得不错。
I see you eat well here.

331
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,420
你给他看!
You showed him!

332
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,130
你好吗?
You good?

333
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,340
我没事，我没事。
I'm fine, I'm fine.

334
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,040
你又偷了那把刀，对吧?
You stole that knife again, didn't you?

335
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,450
不是那样的!
It's not like that!

336
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,330
走吧!快跑!
Go! Run!

337
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,730
他在哪里?
Where is he?

338
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:07,280
他在这里，他在这里!
He's here, he's here!

339
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,060
主人,主人!
Master, master!

340
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:10,440
Mureuk !
Mureuk!

341
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:12,770
Mureuk !
Mureuk!

342
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:14,920
醒醒吧!
Wake up!

343
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,300
他去了哪里?
Where did he go?

344
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,360
我们得找到那把刀。
We've got to find that knife.

345
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,690
这很有趣。他怎么这么对你的?
Well this is interesting. How did he do this to you?

346
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,460
狗屎又跑了。
Dogturd made a run for it again.

347
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,020
你还好吗?
Are you alright?

348
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,670
我想我的背扭伤了。
I think I threw my back out.

349
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,930
为什么我的脸颊会痛?
Why does my cheek hurt?

350
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,290
你打我了吗?
Did you hit me?

351
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,370
我吗?
Me?

352
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:37,220
他。我为什么要那么做?
Noooo. Why would I do that?

353
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,810
嘿,哇!你看到了吗?
Hey, wow! Would you look at that?

354
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:57,980
这是什么?
What is this?

355
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,080
是石头吗?
Is it a stone?

356
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,660
什么样的石头会那样发光?
What kind of stone shines like that?

357
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,980
不管是什么，看起来像钱。
Whatever it is, it looks like money.

358
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,390
它一定是由于干旱而浮出水面的。
It must have surfaced because of the the drought.

359
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,170
-它在发出噪音。-嘿，那边有人。
- It's making a noise.  - Hey there's someone over there.

360
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:45,340
我们打电话给你是因为伊安出了点问题。
We called you because there's a problem with Yian.

361
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:49,400
她最近去了警察局，想举报你。
She recently went to a police station and tried to report you.

362
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,650
当警察问她为什么来的时候，
When the police asked why she'd come,

363
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:55,610
她说你绑架了她，
She said that you had kidnapped her,

364
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:59,850
还有从那以后你一直在扰乱她的记忆，等等。
and that you had been messing with her memory since then, and so on.

365
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:02,850
好吧，让我们来放磁带。
Well, let's just play the tape.

366
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,350
我们直接从局里拿到的。
We got it straight from the station.

367
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:08,410
你爸爸为什么要玩弄你的大脑?
Why does your father play with your brain?

368
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,570
他是医生吗?
Is he a doctor?

369
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:10,690
不,女士。
No, ma'am.

370
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,690
老实说，他不是我父亲。
Honestly, he's not my father.

371
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,010
他是一个机器人。
He's a robot.

372
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,210
像cyborg。
Like a cyborg.

373
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,370
这是令人兴奋的。
Well, that's exciting.

374
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,120
你怎么知道你爸爸是机器人?
And how can you tell your father is a robot?

375
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,250
这是个好问题。你看，我昨天拍了一个视频
That's a good question. You see, I took a video yesterday-

376
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:26,790
因为有时候他不是我爸爸，他是雷霆。
Because sometimes he's not my dad, he's Thunder.

377
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,330
所以我怀疑,
So I doubted-

378
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:29,080
雷是谁?
Who's Thunder?

379
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,410
他是我父亲开的车
He's the car my father drives,

380
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,410
但有时他会变成我父亲。
but sometimes he changes into my father.

381
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,910
我记得他们带走我的时候。
I remember from when they took me.

382
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,550
他们已经把视频删掉了。
Oh, they've already erased the video.

383
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,020
我应该更小心的。
I should have been more careful.

384
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,630
我再看一段视频，然后回来。
I'll get another video and come back.

385
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:50,310
她离开车站来到学校。你是怎么想的?
And she left the station and came to school. What are your thoughts?

386
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,810
抹去局里的录像。
Wipe the video from the station.

387
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,600
它已经完成了。
It's already done.

388
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,290
那个女人一直在监视你。小心些而已。
That woman's been watching you. Be careful.

389
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:00,890
哪一个?
Which one?

390
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:01,830
直走。
Straight ahead.

391
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,840
下午!
Afternoon!

392
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,230
你一定在等奕安!
You must be waiting for Yian!

393
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,450
我Minsun的姑姑。
I'm Minsun's aunt.

394
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:10,100
我明白了。
I see.

395
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,610
敏孙和怡安真是好朋友!
Minsun and Yian are such good friends!

396
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,330
可能是因为他们都不擅长踢足球吧。
Probably because they're both so bad at soccer.

397
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,920
我打赌他们会成为一辈子的朋友!你不这样认为吗?
I bet they'll be lifelong friends! Don't you think so?

398
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,340
确定。
Sure.

399
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:19,860
你想喝点咖啡吗?
Would you like some coffee?

400
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,980
我在学校见过你几次，
I've seen you around the school a few times,

401
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,120
所以我觉得我应该自我介绍一下!
so I figured I should introduce myself!

402
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,400
你多大了?你有房产吗?
How old are you? Do you own any real estate?

403
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,020
我阿姨觉得你爸爸很帅。
My aunt thinks your dad is handsome.

404
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,960
他是。
He is.

405
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,760
所以我才长得这么帅。
That's where I got my good looks.

406
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,540
但是我们能做什么呢?
But what can we do?

407
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,890
我爸爸不喜欢她。
My dad doesn't like her.

408
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,560
他看起来像是在玩躲避球。
He looks like he's playing dodgeball.

409
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,860
她会没事的。看她。
She'll be fine. Look at her.

410
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,880
她是一个永不放弃的女人。
She's a woman who never gives up.

411
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,770
阿姨!
Auntie!

412
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,790
嘿Minsun !
Hey Minsun!

413
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,820
啊，原来你是易安!你这么漂亮!
Ah, so you're Yian! You're so pretty!

414
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,460
你的帅气是遗传你爸的吗?
Did you get your good looks from your dad?

415
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,710
这是我自己做的。
These are a little something I baked up myself.

416
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,000
这是给你和依安的!
These are for you and Yian!

417
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,900
他们非常好。
They're shockingly good.

418
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:05,700
开车安全。
Drive safe.

419
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,060
我们走吧!

校长说了什么?
What did the principal say?

00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:26,150
你不好奇我今天和朋友们做了什么吗?

424
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:26,890
不,我不是。

谢谢你载我一程，雷霆。

我记得。

432
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,430
你的日子不多了…
Your days are numbered...

433
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,110
你和她谈过了吗?
Have you been talking to her?

434
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,270
一个字也没有。
Not a word.

435
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:05,350
我是说，她年轻的时候我是这么做的。

436
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,310
她还记得那件事吗?

437
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,560
但雷是什么?
But what's Thunder?

438
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,030
那是我的名字吗?

439
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,240
放弃它。
Quit it.

440
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,760
很奇怪的东西。
Something's weird.

441
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,560
你话太多了。
You talk too much.

442
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,570
为什么会被抹去?我的名字?
Why would that have been erased? My name?

443
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,960
把报告给我。

我仍然搜索。

451
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,050
每天晚上9点，我父亲就消失了，
Every night at 9 o'clock, my father disappears,

452
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,210
所有的灯都熄灭了。

453
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:54,600
在这里。
There it is.

454
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,850
雷声!
Thunder!

455
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:05,890
对我来说太好了?

456
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,040
我明白了。
I see how it is.

457
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,410
看来我得自己去找答案了。
Guess I gotta get all my answers myself.

458
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,340
那是什么?
What is that?

459
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:24,310
不喜欢。
Don't.

460
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:25,080
嗯?
Huh?

461
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:34,920
不喜欢。

00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,100
雷声。
Thunder.

464
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,160
从我小的时候。
From when I was little.

465
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,640
但是…为什么我的名字叫雷霆?
But... Why is my name Thunder?

466
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,940
你不喜欢吗?
You don't like it?

467
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,310
我已经习惯了。
I'm getting used to it.

468
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,610
很好。
It's good.

469
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,660
那么，你到底是什么人?
So, what exactly are you?

470
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,690
你从哪里来?
Where did you come from?

471
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,190
对于你的第一个问题，我是一个程序，
For your first question, I am a program,

472
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,890
它可以处理数据并改变其物理形式。

473
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:03,950
你想要什么?

474
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:05,990
你的爸爸?
Your dad?

475
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:10,630
但是…你不是…
But... you're not...

476
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,840
你是全息影像吗?
Are you a hologram?

477
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,790
不,我是真实的。我真的在这里。
No, I'm real. I'm really here.

478
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,930
我甚至曾经抱过你。

479
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,620
你问我来自哪里!
You asked where I'm from!

480
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,520
你大老远从那里过来的?
You came all the way from there?

481
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,180
你和爸爸是外星人吗?
Does that mean you and Dad are aliens?

482
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,550
对我来说，你就是外星人。
To me, you're the alien.

483
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,110
我爸爸是你老板吗?
Is my Dad your boss?

484
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,560
老板?不。
Boss? No.

485
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,320
我们的同志。平等的。
We're comrades. Equals.

486
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,190
我只是把战斗留给他，因为我反对暴力。
I just leave the combat to him because I'm against violence.

487
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,260
你的家很远吗?
Is your home far away?

488
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,150
虽然很远，但不会花很长时间
Well, it's far, but it doesn't take us very long beca-

489
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,370
爱因斯坦。

490
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,150
你快。

491
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,490
你长得这么聪明!
You grew up so smart!

492
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,770
你甚至帮我起了名字。
You even found my name for me.

493
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:59,030
真的吗?嘿!自动贩卖机里的零食都是你换的!
Really? Hey! You're the one who changes the snacks in the vending machine!

494
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,410
我做!你怎么能吃这么多鱼干?
I do! How do you eat so much fish jerky?

495
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:03,930
——对吗?和玉米零食!——对吧!
- Right? And corn snacks!      - Right!

496
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,800
明天的植入手术在哪里?
Oh and what and where is the implantation tomorrow?

497
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,200
在医院吗?他们会为囚犯找到尸体的。
Ah at the hospital? They'll find bodies for the prisoners.

498
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,420

叛徒。
Traitor.

501
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,830
我不是叛徒。我只是想知道
I'm not a traitor. I just wanted to kn-

502
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,590
你爸爸要来了。滚出去!很快!
Your dad's coming. Get out! Quickly!

503
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:29,840
等等。
Wait.

504
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,280
我从哪里来?
Where did I come from?

505
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,310
我下次再告诉你!你要走了!

506
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,520
请告诉我!

507
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,630
我从哪里来?
Where did I come from?

508
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:39,870
过去!646年前!
The past! 646 years ago!

509
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,640
忘了我跟你说的医院的事!
And forget what I told you about the hospital!

510
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,970
你必须!

我只是喜欢记录人物。

你永远不知道什么时候会失去记忆。
You never know when you'll lose your memory.

520
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,580
你有点病态。
You're a little morbid.

521
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,650
你会忘记什么事情?
What kinds of things do you forget?

522
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:43,630
没有什么,但是……你永远不会知道的。

你们看到了吗?它是漂亮!

营救囚犯的准备工作已经完成。

00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,690
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

530
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,710
我来这里干什么?
What did I come in here for?

531
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:45,580
可怜的人。
Poor man.

532
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,460
哦，多么惨痛的损失……
Oh, what a devastating loss...

533
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,730
我们还有很多事要谈。

这是我第一次见你这样。
This is the first time I've seen you like this.

535

我告诉过你拿刀的是他，不是吗?
I told you he was the one with the knife, didn't I?

536
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:00,900
你所做的。
You did.

537
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,890
是另一个人偷的!
And that other man stole it!

538
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:03,010
一个犯罪!
A criminal!

539
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,550
他会是什么样的多萨?
What kind of Dosa could he be?

540
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,990
首先,
First of all,

541
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,050
我敢肯定他不是Dosa。
I feel certain he isn't a Dosa.

542
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:12,410
小偷在这里。有什么锋利的东西穿墙而入，把门撞得粉碎。
The thief was here. Something sharp went through the wall and and smashed the door.

543
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,600
也许是偷来的东西?
Maybe the stolen item?

544
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,010
不知怎么的，我不这么认为。
Somehow, I don't think so.

545
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:20,470
一个触手?
A tentacle?

546
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,570
在这里吗?
Here?

547
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,500
偏偏是这里?
Here, of all places?

548
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,470
我的心比赛。
My heart races.

549
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,290
和我们看到的那个一样吗?
Is it like that thing we saw-?

550
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:26,990
我想是的。
I think so.

551
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,350
你还记得吗?
Do you remember?

552
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,700
那个一直住在米尔本的人。
That man who's been living in Milbon.

553
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,360
是的，我想我们应该去拜访他。
Yes, I think we should pay him a visit.

554
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,060
我想我们应该。
I think we should.

555
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,520
你是…三岳山的法师?
Are you... the mages of Samgak mountain?

556
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,650
正确的。
Correct.

557
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,630
你卖那些小饰品?
And you sell the trinkets?

558
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,300
小饰品吗?你听到了吗?
Trinkets? Are you hearing this guy?

559
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,310
镇上的人说这个人已经在这里住了十年了!
The people in town said this guy has lived here for ten years!

560
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,510
他是个非常稳重的人
He is extremely dan-

561
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,530
你真的要进去吗?
Are you actually going in?

562
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,620
是的。
Yeah.

563
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,420
不去看，或者
Not gonna check it out or-

564
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,780
在神庙中找到神圣之剑，并把它带到约定的地点。
Locate the Divine Sword in the temple and bring it to the agreed-upon location.

565
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:00,900
找到什么?
Locate what?

566
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,920
什么?
The what?

567
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,390
你觉得是米尔本的神庙吗?
Do you think it's the temple at Milbon?

568
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:04,320
是他们点的吗?
Are they the ones ordering this?

569
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,040
他们为什么要找同一把刀?
Why would they be looking for the same knife?

570
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,310
哇。这幅画很奇怪。
Whoa. This picture is strange.

571
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:12,160
那是什么?
What is that?

572
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:13,250
哦!
Oh!

573
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:15,740
为什么我觉得我以前见过这个方形的东西?
Why do I feel like I've seen this square thing before?

574
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:19,930
这么说住在这里的人真的是疯了。
So the guy who lived here was actually just crazy, then.

575
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,950
在哪里可以看到这些奇怪的东西?
Where could someone see all these weird things?

576
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:48,620
为了能够敲开这扇美好的门，我们走了很长的路。
That was an awfully long way to come, just to be able to knock on this fine door.

577
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,950
我真希望他没去别的地方。
I sure hope he hasn't gone anywhere.

578
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,290
根据你告诉我的，那不是他的风格。
From what you told me, that doesn't seem to be his style.

579
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:57,380
我听说他自从十年前来到这里就没出过这扇门。
I heard he hasn't stepped foot outside these gates since he arrived here ten years ago.

580
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,340
你认为他是什么样的人?
What kind of person do you suppose he is?

581
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:03,990
让我们尽我们所能卖掉这些小饰品，看看我们能不能弄明白。
Let's sell our little trinkets as hard as we can and see if we can figure that out.

582
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:08,170
三阁山的法师来了，大人。
The mages of Samgak mountain have arrived, my lord.

583
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:14,970
天哪，是他自己。
Goodness gracious, the man himself.

584
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:17,990
他见到我们非常高兴。我透过他的面具都能感觉到。
He's overjoyed to see us. I can feel it even through his mask.

585
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:18,690
所以你是对的。
You're so right.

586
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:22,630
你们就是我听说过的不可思议的法师。
So you're the incredible mages I've heard so much about.

587
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:25,160
感谢您的光临。
Thank you for gracing me with your presence.

588
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,500
如果我们听说密尔邦对我们的货物有兴趣，我们当然要马上赶来。
If we hear that Milbon has interest in our wares, of course we must come right away.

589
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,280
让我们给你看看我们能提供什么。
Let us show you what we can offer.

590
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:30,830
的事情
things

591
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:35,750
到目前为止，我们提供给米尔邦的产品与我们今天带给您的产品相比，显得苍白无力。
The products that we have offered Milbon so far pale in comparison to the wares we bring you today.

592
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,300
例如，这个护身符……
For example, this talisman...

593
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,920
能让我同时出现在两个地方。
can allow me to be in two places at once.

594
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,310
密切关注。
Watch closely.

595
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,100
看来这不是你要找的东西。
Ah, I see this is not what you're looking for.

596
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,670
我们试试别的吧。
Let's try something else.

597
00:41:58,650 --> 00:41:59,500
不要去任何地方。
Don't go anywhere.

598
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,740
我已经追上你了。
I have caught you fast.

599
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:04,050
如果您愿意从我们这里购买一件，我将再买一件以示感谢。
If you are so kind to purchase one from us, I will add a second one in gratitude.

600
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:06,110
我明白了。
I see.

601
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,960
在这里!我们有这面宏伟的铜镜!
And here! We have this magnificent bronze mirror!

602
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:13,070
其他镜像根本无法与之相比。
Other mirrors can simply not compare.

603
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:18,500
一个不诚实的人看着这面镜子，会发现自己的不诚实被放大了十倍。
A dishonest man can look into this mirror and see his dishonesty magnified tenfold.

604
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,860
我能看到自己的美丽和纯洁。
And I can see my own beauty and purity.

605
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,030
你想看一看吗?
Would you like to have a look?

606
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:27,320
在密尔本，我们自己的外表并不重要。
In Milbon, our own appearances are of no importance.

607
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,860
你真聪明。
How wise of you.

608
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,960
但镜子的放大率也有其他用途。
But the mirror's magnifying powers can be of other uses as well.

609
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,440
有了它的帮助，小事情不必再小了。
With its help, small things don't have to be small.

610
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,940
整个聚会只要喝一杯就足够了。
Just one drink can become enough for an entire gathering.

611
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:42,020
在战斗中，一个小拳头就可以变成一支军队。
And in a fight, just one small fist can become an entire army.

612
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:47,010
看着我的手。
Keep your eyes on my hand.

613
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:48,350
好了，开始。
Alright, here we go.

614
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:50,680
哦，我一这么做就会有大麻烦了。
Oh, there's going to be big trouble as soon as I do this.

615
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,920
我想我们已经给他看得够多了。
I think we've shown him enough.

616
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,520
我很惊讶仅仅是人类就能做出如此非凡的产品。
I'm amazed to hear that mere humans could make such extraordinary products like this.

617
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,410
是的，我们不是很了不起吗?
Yes, aren't we quite remarkable.

618
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,120
这。
And this.

619
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,860
无价的阿拉伯磨刀石。
A priceless Arabian whetstone.

620
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:08,070
即使成千上万的士兵每天使用这块石头，它也需要15年才能开始磨损。
Even if thousands of soldiers used this stone every day, it would take 15 years to begin to wear away.

621
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:09,920
这刀刃可以用三年。
The blade's edge will hold for three years.

622
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,400
仔细想想，它是无价的。
It's priceless when you think about it.

623
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:15,000
但如果你要给它定价的话…
But if you had to put a price on it...

624
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,310
至少70 pil。
70 pil, at least.

625
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,440
嗳哟!
Oho!

626
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,200
如果你不感兴趣的话就没必要提这个。
Ah, there's no reason to bring that up if you're not interested.

627
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,060
有什么发现吗?
Did you find something?

628
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:24,070
如果贵方第一眼不能被我们的商品所吸引，就没有必要向贵方推销。
If you are not charmed by our wares on first glance, there is no point in selling them to you.

629
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,030
看看那家酒吧还在不在这附近。
Let's see if that bar is still around here.

630
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:30,410
都这么久了，我真的在想…
It's been so long, I really wonder...

631
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:31,440
浪费会议时间。
Waste of a meeting.

632
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,450
你们俩真的知道神刀在哪里吗?
Do the two of you really know where the Divine Knife is?

633
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:35,260
当然。
Of course.

634
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,710
北村，在一个企业主的手中。
Bukchon, in the hands of a business owner.

635
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:39,400
至少是这样。
Or it was, at least.

636
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,930
不幸的是，被一个叫狗屎的人偷走了。
Unfortunately, a man named Dogturd stole it.

637
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:45,050
米本有什么办法能帮你找到它吗?
Is there any way that Milbon can assist you in finding it?

638
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:48,580
咔咔。
Ho ho.

639
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:51,990
一个很好的问题。
An excellent question.

640
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:03,910
这些混蛋知道他们在干什么吗?
What do these bastards think they're doing?

641
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,890
哦，新郎确实是个很好的人。
Oh, the groom is a very fine man indeed.

642
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:09,350
留着漂亮的小胡子。你看到那胡子了吗?
And sporting a fine mustache. Did you see that mustache?

643
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:15,000
什么?下马。
What? Dismount.

644
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,060
把你的胡子借给我。
Lend me your mustache.

645
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:17,890
我的-我的胡子?
My- My mustache?

646
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:18,630
是的。
Yep.

647
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:21,320
他在这里。他在这里!
He's here. He's here!

648
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,330
新郎到了!
The groom has arrived!

649
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:43,370
新郎是一个真正的男人!
The groom is a real man!

650
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:49,040
大家快围过来!
Everyone gather 'round quickly!

651
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,230
你觉得它在那边吗?
Is it over there, do you think?

652
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,340
我不确定。
I'm not sure.

653
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,840
新郎新娘齐聚一堂!仪式开始!
The bride and groom are gathered! Let the ceremony begin!

654
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,720
让我们第一次一起喝一杯吧!
Let's share our first drink together!

655
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,400
嗯。先做什么?
Um. What comes off first?

656
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,410
我的新娘……
My bride...

657
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,560
.．.是美丽的。
...is beautiful.

658
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,440
但是…
But...

659
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:36,020
我们以前是不是在什么地方见过?
Haven't we met somewhere before?

660
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,800
这是不可能的。
That's impossible.

661
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:41,990
如果我们只是——
What if we just-

662
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:43,220
摆脱,
Get rid of-

663
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,070
这是什么?
What is this?

664
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,050
这没什么好担心的。
It's nothing that you need to concern yourself with.

665
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:04,830
我们先喝一杯好吗?
Shall we start with a drink?

666
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:06,910
当然。做一下。
Sure. Let's do that.

667
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:14,640
我们不应该让主人好好享受一下吗?
Shouldn't we let our master enjoy himself?

668
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,360
我们还有工作要做!我们不能玩变装游戏!
We have work to do! We can't be playing dress-up!

669
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:19,330
荒谬。
Ridiculous.

670
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,490
哦，看，他们在蒸鱼!
Oh look, they steamed fish!

671
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,850
这还不是季节呢!
It's not even in season!

672
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:25,790
这宝贵的东西…
This precious stuff...

673
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:26,560
第一次……
First...

674
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,010
一个小零食。
A little snack.

675
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:28,990
是的，只会一点。
Yes, just a little.

676
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:30,750
不是春天，不是……
It's not spring, no...

677
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:32,620
但这种鱼在秋天会更好吃!
But this fish is even better in the fall!

678
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:34,080
我认为你是对的。
I think you're right.

679
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,190
啊，等一下。我有些事要处理。
Ah, just one second. I need to take care of something.

680
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:49,350
我简直不敢相信。
I can't seem to believe it.

681
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,650
我嫁给了像你这样的人。
That I've married someone like you.

682
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:04,970
他很可爱。
He's cute.

683
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:11,630
你为什么这么坚持?
Why are you being so insistent?

684
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:13,560
我得确保它不在里面!
I had to make sure it wasn't in there!

685
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,020
主人，我们听说在家里的仓库里，在墙那边。
Master, we heard it's in the family storehouse, over that wall.

686
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:16,840
我明白，我明白。
I get it, I get it.

687
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,670
你喝酒吗?
Were you drinking?

688
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:19,230
我刚生了一个小孩。
I just had a little one.

689
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:40,330
什么-
What-

690
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:42,630
我是怎么了?
What's happening to me?

691
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,670
我们是三岳山的双重法师。
We are the dual mages of Mount Samgak.

692
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:04,660
谁也不许离开这房子。
No one leaves this house.

693
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,690
把你仓库里的东西拿来，别惹麻烦。
Bring us the contents of your storehouse and don't cause any trouble.

694
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:13,940
我们得到了密尔邦的多萨的帮助…
We are aided by the Dosa of Milbon...

695
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,140
所以如果你想看到早上就不要越过那条线。
So don't cross that line if you want to see morning.

696
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,800
立即阻止他们!
Stop them immediately!

697
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,230
你知道你在干什么吗?
What do you think you're doing?

698
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:40,400
我不知道你在这里做什么
I don't know what the hell you're doing here

699
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,300
但你得在…之前滚出我家
But you get out of my house bef-

700
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,070
你的意志就是我的意志。
Your will is mine.

701
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,430
是的。
Yes.

702
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:01,000
你的意志就是我的意志。
Your will is mine.

703
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:05,340
把你隐藏的东西带给我。
Bring me what you've hidden.

704
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,080
你的意志就是我的意志。
Your will is mine.

705
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,230
把你隐藏的宝藏带给我。
Bring me your hidden treasures.

706
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:12,720
是的。
Yes.

707
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,020
你说的任何东西。
Anything you say.

708
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:19,450
Aigoo。
Aigoo.

709
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:21,500
我的夫人!你在这里做什么?
My lady! What are you doing here?

710
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:25,000
你怎么了?
What happened to you?

711
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:27,010
Eunnie, Eunnie !
Eunnie, eunnie!

712
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:30,070
他们把我捆成这样!
They tied me up like this!

713
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,350
但如果你在这里…那谁结婚了?
But if you're here... then who got married?

714
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:38,900
对不起，让你久等了
Sorry to have kept you waiting-

715
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,820
马上把神圣之刀给我拿来!
Bring the Divine Knife to me immediately!

716
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:52,690
等等，你不是-你不是真正的新娘吗?
Wait, are you- Are you not the real bride?

717
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,280
看来你也不是真正的新郎。
Seems like you're not the real groom, either.

718
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:57,950
等待……
Wait...

719
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:01,060
你给我下药了吗?
Did you drug me?

720
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:02,190
是的。
Yeah.

721
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:03,150
“是的”?
'Yeah'??

722
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,330
你不会死的。别担心。
You won't die. Don't worry.

723
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:12,130
解药。
Antidote.

724
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:15,260
一定有解药。
There must be an antidote.

725
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:16,710
没有。
There isn't.

726
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,760
没有吗?
There isn't?

727
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:20,300
睡一觉就好了。你会没事的。
Just sleep it off. You'll be fine.

728
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,710
我来对付那些混蛋。
I'll take care of those bastards.

729
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,410
我是唯一能做到的人。
I'm the only one who can.

730
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:29,930
你有这个。
You've got this.

731
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:31,750
你能做到的。
You can do it.

732
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:32,850
你是…
You are...

733
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,370
你疯了!
Out of your mind!

734
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:39,840
我知道我不是真正的新娘，
I know I'm not the real bride,

735
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:41,740
但我会非常怀念今天。
but I'll remember today very fondly.

736
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,370
待在原地别动!
Stay where you are!

737
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:02,810
啊，原来是把枪。
Ah, so that's a gun.

738
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:04,360
没关系。
It doesn't matter.

739
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:07,530
把那个给我。
Give that to me.

740
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:08,510
是的,女士。
Yes, ma'am.

741
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:11,140
不要动。
Don't move.

742
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:25,190
顺便说一下…你擅长解谜吗?
By the way... how are you at solving puzzles?

743
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:58,860
这很清晰。
That's very sharp.

744
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:04,680
噢,那刺!
Ow, that stings!

745
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:07,190
我有她!
I've got her!

746
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,480
把那女孩带过来。
Bring the girl with us.

747
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:47,810
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

748
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:51,940
Mureuk !
Mureuk!

749
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,110
他是来。
He's coming to.

750
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:58,430
按摩他，按摩他。
Massage him, massage him.

751
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:00,390
那个女人是从哪里来的?
Where did that woman come from?

752
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:01,990
我想问她的，但是
I tried to ask her that, but -

753
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:03,020
新郎在里面。
The groom is inside.

754
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,190
我们走吧。
Let's get out of here.

755
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:09,780
嘿,那件事。
Hey, that thing.

756
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,160
砰砰的枪声!抓住它!
The bang-bang! Grab it!

757
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,250
砰砰的枪声?这- - - - - -
The bang-bang? This -

758
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,630
什么?这是什么?
What?  What is this?

759
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,740
砰砰的枪声是什么?
What's a bang-bang?

760
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,510
嗨,燕。
Hey, Yian.

761
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,330
你为什么没去上学?
Why weren't you at school?

762
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,830
我离家出走了。
I ran away from home.

763
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:26,890
我今晚可以留下来吗?
Can I stay over tonight?

764
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:29,980
哦我的上帝!这真的是我们的医院吗?
Oh my God! Is this really our hospital?

765
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:31,580
这是你自己拍的?
And you filmed this yourself?

766
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:32,230
正确的。
Right.

767
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:34,780
他们脑子里想的是什么?
What are those things going into their heads?

768
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:36,780
你爸爸也是那样的人吗?
Is your dad one of those things?

769
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:37,320
嘘。
Shh.

770
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:39,440
阿姨吗?
Auntie?

771
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:40,620
嗯?
Huh?

772
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:42,910
我什么都没做。
I'm- I'm not doing anything.

773
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:44,830
我只是路过。自然。
I'm just passing by. Naturally.

774
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:46,390
我消失……
I'm going away...

775
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,160
我们从敏生家来的。
We've arrived in from of Minsun's house.

776
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,140
我从来不知道该对人类说什么。
I never know what to say to humans.

777
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:56,900
你去代替。
You go instead.

778
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:58,310
我吗?
Me?

779
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:00,130
我应该用什么外观?
What appearance should I use?

780
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,060
我!我会做的!接我!
Me! I'll do it! Pick me!

781
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:04,870
我一直想说服一个人类!
I've always wanted to persuade a human!

782
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,470
你跟人类说过话吗?
Have you ever spoken to a human?

783
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:07,290
你没有，是吗?
You haven't, have you?

784
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:09,290
我只是在等待合适的机会。
I'm just waiting for the right opportunity.

785
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:10,670
我对人类略知一二。
I know a little bit about humans.

786
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:11,550
我去。
I'll go.

787
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:12,900
不要着急。
Hold your horses.

788
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,320
你知道怎么勾引女人吗?
Do you know how to seduce a woman?

789
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:15,850
你们俩有谁跟他们说过话吗?
Have either of you ever talked to one?

790
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,660
深情地说，眼神交流，问问题，抱着她的腰。
Speak deeply, make eye contact, ask questions, hold her waist.

791
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:22,320
你有这方面的经验吗?
Do you have any experience in these things?

792
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:24,260
那我们三个都去吗?
Should we all three go then?

793
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:26,260
不。只有一个人。只有一个。
No. Just one of you. Just one.

794
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:28,640
你这样做。
You do it.

795
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:30,670
尽量简短。
Just keep it short.

796
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:31,400
燕。
and get Yian.

797
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,970
这就是精神。
That's the spirit.

798
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:34,240
好吗?
Shall we?

799
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,390
让我们偷一些心吧。
Let's steal some hearts.

800
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:02,410
哦,你好…
Oh, hello...

801
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:03,550
你就在那里。
There you are.

802
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:04,720
所以。
So.

803
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:06,480
啊，你是来接依安的吗?
Ah, did you come to get Yian?

804
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,370
这不是显而易见的吗?
Isn't it obvious?

805
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:10,530
我知道你对我有兴趣。
I know that you're interested in me.

806
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:10,980
我是谁?
I am?

807
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:11,980
你。
You are.

808
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:18,990
我想知道我能不能找个时间给你打电话。这样可以吗?
Ah, I had wondered if I could call you up sometime.  Is that alright then?

809
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:19,970
是的。
Yes.

810
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:22,210
你绝对应该这样做。
You should definitely do that.

811
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:27,170
那么，我应该叫怡安吗?她在楼上。
Should I get Yian, then? She's upstairs.

812
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,990
我宁愿和你继续聊。
I'd rather keep talking to you.

813
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,490
你叫什么名字?
What's your name?

814
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:33,960
啊，我是闵桂仁。(听起来像“外星人”)
Ah, I'm Min Gye-in. (sounds like 'alien')

815
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:38,870
我已经知道了。
I already know.

816
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:40,910
我妈为什么这么叫我，对吧?
Why would my mom call me that, right?

817
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:43,810
我取了很多绰号。好。基本上就是《异形，异形》。
I've picked up a lot of nicknames. Well. Mostly just 'Alien, Alien.'

818
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:45,790
Minsun !
Minsun!

819
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,460
分钟Gye-in小姐。
Miss Min Gye-in.

820
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:49,940
关于你…
The thing about you...

821
00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:52,470
你是如此幸运…
Is you're so lucky...

822
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:54,600
你不是外星人。
You're no alien.

823
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,160
你真好。
Very kind of you.

824
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,890
Welp。让我们出去。
Welp. Let's head out.

825
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:31,940
医院里的那些人是怎么了?
What went into those people at the hospital?

826
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,920
我在问你问题!
I'm asking you a question!

827
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,720
哦,她是疯了。
Ooh, she's mad.

828
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,200
你还不了解人类吗?
Do you still not understand humans?

829
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,400
向他们隐瞒事情是没有意义的。
There's no point in trying to hide things from them.

830
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,600
燕。坐,坐。
Yian. Sit, sit.

831
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,300
那些人是怎么了?
What went into those people?

832
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,540
然后。我们会回答你三个问题。
So then. We will answer exactly three of your questions.

833
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:50,630
好吧?如此!
Okay? So!

834
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:52,720
那些人是怎么了?
What went into those people?

835
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,370
啊,,。
Ah, that.

836
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:56,390
所以问题是…
So the thing is...

837
00:57:56,390 --> 00:58:00,250
很长一段时间以来，我们一直把地球上的囚犯锁在人类的身体里。
for a really long time we've been locking up our planet's prisoners in human bodies.

838
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:00,560
对吧?
Right?

839
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,250
停止。
Stop.

840
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:02,730
不，我来吧。
No, I've got this.

841
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:07,910
每个星球都是一样的，对吧?有文明，有战争，有人口下降……
Every planet is the same, right? There's civilization, there's war, there's a decline in population...

842
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:09,670
但每个人都想要和平。
But everybody wants peace.

843
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:11,550
我们当然也有罪犯。
We have criminals like anybody else, sure.

844
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:13,420
但是一个全新的问题出现了。
But then a whole new problem appears.

845
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:15,340
我们的种群开始变异。
Our population starts mutating.

846
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:18,140
生活与和平颠倒了!
Life and peace turned upside down!

847
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:21,200
突变如此强大，他们可以摧毁和杀戮。
Mututions so powerful they can destroy and kill.

848
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,680
然后呢?
Then what?

849
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,270
所以你需要一个监狱。
So then you need a prison.

850
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:26,770
你必须把他们带到很远的地方，让他们永远不会回来。
You have to take them so far away that they can never come back.

851
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:31,210
这是最难以进入的地方。
The most impenetrable place there is.

852
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:32,840
一个连监狱长都不记得的监狱。
A prison that even the wardens won't remember.

853
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:36,330
人类的心灵。
The human mind.

854
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:38,040
把罪犯放进去
Put a criminal in there,

855
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,540
他们被困住了，直到那个人死了把他们俩都毁灭。
And they're trapped, until the human dies and destroys them both.

856
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:44,190
我们就是这么做的。
That's how we do it.

857
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:45,690
但我们还没同意。
But we haven't agreed to this.

858
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:47,300
未经允许进入我们的大脑?
Going into our brains without permission?

859
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:48,720
我们为什么需要许可?
Why would we need permission?

860
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,820
你不应该那样对待别人。
You shouldn't treat people like that.

861
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:52,450
人类物质。
Humans matter.

862
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:54,420
你长得这么聪明!
You grew up so smart!

863
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:55,890
这是你最好的特点。
It's your best trait.

864
00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:56,400
闭嘴。
Shut up.

865
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:58,450
下一个问题。
Next question.

866
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:00,620
这些罪犯能离开他们的身体吗?
Can these criminals leave their human bodies?

867
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,260
有一点，但这里的气氛不同。
For a little bit, but the atmosphere is different here.

868
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,300
大概五分钟?
About what, five minutes?

869
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:07,040
是的。他们可以在外面待那么久。
Yeah. They can stay out for about that long.

870
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:10,620
如果他们醒了，我就把他们困起来藏起来。
If they awaken, I trap and store them.

871
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:11,570
在哪里?
Where?

872
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:12,380
这里。
Here.

873
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,230
后面有房间吗?
There's a room back there?

874
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:25,470
如果他们唤醒……
If they awaken...

875
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:27,520
人受伤?
People get hurt?

876
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,440
这就是我要阻止的。
That's what I'm here to prevent.

877
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,390
所以你是在保护我们。
So you're protecting us.

878
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:32,830
我是看守囚犯的。
I'm a Guard who manages prisoners.

879
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,200
人类与我无关。
Humans are not my concern.

880
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,610
提问时间结束。
Question time is over.

881
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,990
那你为什么养我?
Then why did you raise me?

882
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:45,600
提问时间结束。
Question time is over.

883
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:03,500
我今晚可以睡在这里，对吗?
I can sleep here tonight, right?

884
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,040
谢谢。
Thanks.

885
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:11,930
你来地球多久了，雷?
How long have you been on Earth, Thunder?

886
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:13,040
你一直都在这里吗?
Have you always been here?

887
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:17,430
你为什么带我来?
Why did you bring me with you?

888
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:24,500
如果我们不这么做，你早就死了。
If we didn't, you would have died.

889
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,910
睡个好觉,燕。
Sleep tight, Yian.

890
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:31,220
晚安,雷声。
Good night, Thunder.

891
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:04,320
嫌犯朝你方向去了。

892
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,120
操作开始。

893
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:08,120
你在干什么?稍等!
What are you doing? Hold the line!

894
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:24,880
别在这里!
Stop right there!

895
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,990
这是警察骚扰，你知道的。
This is police harassment, you know.

896
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:30,460
啊，太浪费了。
Ah, what a waste.

897
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:42,160
别拍我!不要开枪!
Don't shoot me! Don't shoot!

898
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:44,290
谢谢你所做的一切。
Thank you for everything.

899
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:46,860
嘿,月亮Doseok。
Hey, Moon Doseok.

900
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:47,420
是的。
Yeah.

901
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,170
你以为你在干什么，向平民开枪吗?
What do you think you're doing, shooting at a civilian?

902
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,590
只是对罪犯开了一枪以示警告。
Just a little warning shot at a criminal.

903
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:53,040
嘿。

904
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,540
下次，你应该打我。
Next time, you should hit me.

905
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:58,450
侦探从来没有完成过任务。
Detectives never get the job done.

906
01:01:58,980 --> 01:01:59,600
原谅我们。
Excuse us.

907
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:20,890
剩下的呢?

我把它藏在阁楼的自行车里了。

想去玩个开心的夜晚吗?

911
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:33,540
哈!
Ta-da!

01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:35,810

925
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:43,380
这个混蛋!他是医院里的囚犯之一!

我们在交火中抓到人类…
We're catching humans in the crossfire...

988
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:51,170
我们找个干净的地方!
Let's get somewhere clear!

989
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:03,490
准备好了…
Ready...

990
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:06,730
集……
Set...

991
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:07,210
火!
Fire!

992
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:13,940
它的心感动!

993
01:13:14,930 --> 01:13:15,580
屏蔽耗尽。

994
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:18,250
我们被击中了!
We've been hit!

995
01:13:18,410 --> 01:13:19,730
崩盘迫在眉睫。

996
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:21,770
更多的能量!
More energy!

997
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,570
我需要更多的时间!我需要更多的时间!
I need more time! I need more time!

998
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:56,200
任务完成。
Mission complete.

999
01:14:56,200 --> 01:15:01,410
控制器被唤醒。
The controller is awakened.

1000
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:20,220
控制器空闲。
The controller is free.

1001
01:15:21,290 --> 01:15:23,720
现在我要自我毁灭…
And now I will self-destruct...

1002
01:15:24,230 --> 01:15:25,810
带你一起走。
And take you with me.

1003
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:37,380
警告:守卫的生命维持系统已启动。
Warning: Guard's life support activated.

1004
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:38,180
能源枯竭!
Energy depleted!

1005
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:44,100
燕!
Yian!

1006
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:45,020
在车里等着!
Wait in the car!

1007
01:15:49,690 --> 01:15:50,980
能量水平为17%。
Energy levels at 17%.

1008
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:52,120
16%。14%。
16%. 14%.

1009
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:52,820
达到临界水平。
Reaching critical levels.

1010
01:15:58,330 --> 01:16:00,000
开始紧急充电。

1011
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:51,580
紧急充电正在进行
Emergency recharge, in progress.

1012
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:52,160
36%。
36%.

1013
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:52,930
38%。
38%.

1014
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:54,950
我的储备已经耗尽了。
My reserves are depleted.

1015
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:00,240
控制器被唤醒。
The controller is awakened.

1016
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:01,030
我们需要更新状态。
We need a status update.

1017
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:01,920
理解。
Understood.

1018
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,100
尽量不要动!
Try not to move!

1019
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:29,700
控制器可以进入飞船。
The controller has access to the ship.

1020
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:43,790
Haava。
Haava.

1021
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:45,350
Haava。
It's Haava.

1022
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:47,850
他们把它带到这个星球上!
They brought it to this planet!

1023
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:51,370
Haava吗?从我们的世界远道而来?
Haava? All the way from our world?

1024
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:54,830
地球的大气层太不一样了!
Earth's atmosphere is too different!

1025
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:55,750
如果他们能部署哈瓦人
If they can deploy the Haava,

1026
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,470
它们将能够永久地改变地球的大气层!
They'll be able to change Earth's atmosphere permanently!

1027
01:17:59,070 --> 01:18:00,510
他们不再需要人类的身体了。
They won't need human bodies anymore.

1028
01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:02,460
他们都可能被唤醒!
They could all be awakened!

1029
01:18:06,730 --> 01:18:07,420
如果这个被释放了
If this is released,

1030
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:09,200
所有的人类都会死在新的大气层里。
all the humans will die in the new atmosphere.

1031
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:10,890
这是真正的…最后。
This is truly... the end.

1032
01:18:11,110 --> 01:18:12,230
我们必须关掉控制器!
We have to stop the controller!

1033
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:20,240
使用能量刀破坏部署!
Use the energy knife to disrupt the deployment!

1034
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:29,400
能量水平又下降了!
Energy levels falling again!

1035
01:18:40,770 --> 01:18:41,870
阻止哈瓦人是最重要的。

1036
01:18:49,790 --> 01:18:50,950
出去抓住控制器
Go out and catch the controller

1037
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:52,450
在他跳进另一个身体之前!
before he can jump into another body!

1038
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:17,950
易安，你还好吗?
Yian, are you okay?

1039
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:18,820
那是什么东西?
What is that thing?

1040
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:20,510
这就是我们在这里的目的。
That's what we're here for.

1041
01:19:23,210 --> 01:19:24,260
我没看到控制器。
I don't see the controller.

1042
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:26,200
上车。
Get in the car.

1043
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:32,140
状态报告。
Status report.

1044
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:35,100
两剂哈瓦烟已经离开飞船。
Two doses of Haava have left the ship.

1045
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:36,530
我会尽量控制住他们。
I'll try to contain them.

1046
01:19:37,510 --> 01:19:40,040
首先找到控制器。不能让他引爆它们。
Find the controller first. He can't be allowed to set them off.

1047
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:50,920
Haava引爆。
Detonate the Haava.

1048
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:53,100
呼叫所有帕罗人。
Calling all Paro within range.

1049
01:19:53,350 --> 01:19:53,990
苏醒了。
Awaken.

1050
01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:41,360
睁开你的眼睛!醒醒吧!
Open your eyes! Wake up!

1051
01:21:42,010 --> 01:21:43,010
皮带-我不能-
The belt- I can't-

1052
01:21:46,630 --> 01:21:47,790
他们只注射了一剂哈瓦烟!
They've deployed one dose of Haava!

1053
01:21:47,790 --> 01:21:49,400
先拯救人类!
Save the humans first!

1054
01:21:52,450 --> 01:21:53,110
我要!
I'm going!

1055
01:22:11,110 --> 01:22:12,590
燕,我们走吧。
Yian, let's go.

1056
01:22:19,610 --> 01:22:20,300
我要送你回家。
I'm sending you home.

1057
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:21,300
雷声!
Thunder!

1058
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:25,450
我必须拯救你的世界。
I have to save your world.

1059
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:27,020
我们走吧。
Let's go.

1060
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:28,810
我必须找到控制器。
I have to find the controller.

1061
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:08,200
那些死去的人…
The people who died...

1062
01:23:08,930 --> 01:23:10,500
那朵明亮的哈瓦云…
That bright cloud of Haava...

1063
01:23:11,810 --> 01:23:18,230
那一天我无法忘记，即使十年后……
That day I couldn't forget, even ten years later...

1064
01:23:26,470 --> 01:23:27,140
你是谁?
Who are you?

1065
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,590
你已经长大了。你忘了我吗?
You've grown up. Did you forget me?

1066
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:35,370
我们一起来的，你知道的。十年前。
We came here together, you know. Ten years ago.

1067
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:39,910
我会继续找那把刀的。
I'll keep trying to get that knife.

1068
01:23:39,910 --> 01:23:40,720
确定。
Sure.

1069
01:23:41,090 --> 01:23:43,180
你也需要我们骑过来的那辆车。
You need that thing we rode here, too.

1070
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:44,560
在哪里?
Where is it?

1071
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:45,360
不晓得。
Dunno.

1072
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:51,780
真的吗?我知道。
Really? I know.

1073
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:55,080
所以我才需要那把刀。
That's why I need that knife.

1074
01:23:55,910 --> 01:23:56,710
在哪里?
Where is it?

1075
01:24:02,890 --> 01:24:05,130
是时候让你尝尝监狱里的滋味了。
It's time you learned what it's like to be in a prison.

1076
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:11,490
我们有时间。想想你将如何在这样的混乱中生存下来。
We've got time. Think about how you're going to survive the mess you're in.

1077
01:24:11,490 --> 01:24:12,070
先生。
Mister.

1078
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:15,690
你走之前为什么不吃顿饭呢?
Why don't you have dinner before you go?

1079
01:24:16,690 --> 01:24:18,130
像你说的。我们有时间。
Like you said. We've got time.

1080
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:42,150
我们被困在时间里了。
We've been trapped in time.

1081
01:24:42,770 --> 01:24:44,830
我们必须在回去之前找到控制器。
We have to find the controller before we go back.

1082
01:24:45,150 --> 01:24:46,930
他一定是改变了身体
He must have changed bodies,

1083
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:50,070
但是法官并没有被唤醒。他刚刚去世。
but the magistrate wasn't awakened. He just died.

1084
01:24:53,150 --> 01:24:56,020
那控制者会在谁的身体里?
So whose body could the controller be in?

1085
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:58,350
那天有四个人看到了我们。
Four humans saw us that day.

1086
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:04,960
裁判官死了。两个法师都被刀割了，但他们也没有被唤醒。
The magistrate died. The dual mages were both cut by the knife, but they were not awakened either.

1087
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:07,500
现在我们必须找到最后一个。
Now we must only locate the last one.

1088
01:25:08,590 --> 01:25:09,340
它很好。
It's fine.

1089
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:11,650
她既听不到也说不出我们的秘密。
She can neither hear nor speak our secrets.

1090
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:17,450
你为什么还呆在这么虚弱的身体里?
Why are you staying in such a weak body?

1091
01:25:19,050 --> 01:25:20,700
换一下不是更好吗?
Wouldn't it be better to switch?

1092
01:25:21,710 --> 01:25:22,890
我会喜欢我的回忆。
I'll love my memories.

1093
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:26,890
如果我不想再被关起来，我需要
And if I don't want to be imprisoned again, I'll need-

1094
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:39,720
Mureuk吗?
Mureuk?

1095
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:40,580
你还好吗?
Are you alright?

1096
01:25:40,580 --> 01:25:43,620
进密尔本大学不是很困难吗?
Isn't it going to be too difficult to get into Milbon?

1097
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:45,380
困难吗?
Difficult?

1098
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:47,080
为我们吗?
For us?

1099
01:25:48,770 --> 01:25:51,410
看看这个。如果我们能填满这一份，那么…
Look at this. If we can just fill this one bounty, then...

1100
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,150
这将解决我们所有的问题。
This will solve all our problems.

1101
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:56,360
你觉得这是什么?
What do you think it is, anyway?

1102
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,510
很明显是很重要的事情。
It's obviously something important.

1103
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:02,340
有可能像你一样英俊聪明吗?
Is it possible to be as handsome and smart as you are?

1104
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:04,550
他是最聪明的!最帅!
Just the very smartest! Very most handsome!

1105
01:26:04,770 --> 01:26:05,930
你不认识我吗?
Don't you know me?

1106
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:09,320
他们的到来。
They're coming.

1107
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:12,600
我们可以开始工作了吗?
Shall we get to work?

1108
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:28,370
在风中，在风中。
In the wind, of the wind.

1109
01:26:54,390 --> 01:26:55,500
你怎么这么晚才来?
Why are you so late?

1110
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:56,890
你找到了吗?
Did you find it?

1111
01:26:57,410 --> 01:26:59,140
他们在等你。我们走吧。
They're waiting on you. Let's go.

1112
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:00,040
正确的。
Right.

1113
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:02,250
你还能再快一点吗?
Are you going to move any faster than that?

1114
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:04,860
我们匆匆。
We're hurrying.

1115
01:27:05,250 --> 01:27:07,330
你要去哪里?
Where do you think you're going?

1116
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:08,600
对的,正确的。
Right, right.

1117
01:27:14,140 --> 01:27:15,400
哦，药在这里。
Oh, the medicine is here.

1118
01:27:17,230 --> 01:27:19,260
我们找到药了，伟大的法师们。
We have found the medicine, great mages.

1119
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:20,390
那一定是难以捉摸的。
It must have been elusive.

1120
01:27:20,390 --> 01:27:20,590
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

1121
01:27:20,930 --> 01:27:21,830
给它。
Give it here.

1122
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:22,290
你听说过他。
You heard him.

1123
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:28,170
致命的蘑菇…
That deadly mushroom...

1124
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:29,580
彻底咀嚼它。
Chew it thoroughly.

1125
01:27:30,970 --> 01:27:31,870
你们谁是解药专家?
Which one of you is the antidote expert?

1126
01:27:34,770 --> 01:27:35,590
我们的解药专家……
Our antidote expert...

1127
01:27:36,230 --> 01:27:37,420
这个人在吗?
Is this man here.

1128
01:27:37,810 --> 01:27:38,250
正确的。
Right.

1129
01:27:39,110 --> 01:27:39,710
专家。
Expert.

1130
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:41,390
快点。咀嚼它。
Hurry. Chew it.

1131
01:27:58,750 --> 01:27:59,390
不要停止咀嚼。
Don't stop chewing.

1132
01:28:07,410 --> 01:28:08,270
麦芽浆。
Mash it up.

1133
01:28:08,430 --> 01:28:09,040
放点口水进去。
Get some saliva in there.

1134
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:16,270
就是这样，就是这样。
That's it, that's it.

1135
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:20,210
现在，你为我带来了什么。
And now, what you have brought for me.

1136
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:26,440
这个吗?
This?

1137
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:29,740
在这里,随地吐痰。
Here, spit.

1138
01:28:38,530 --> 01:28:40,600
你嚼得很好。
You chewed it very effectively.

1139
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:51,710
这艘船在碧南井附近的山谷中浮出水面。
The ship has surfaced in the valley near Byeoknanjung.

1140
01:28:52,690 --> 01:28:54,090
我们有它。
We've got it.

1141
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:02,610
为什么刀现在有反应了?
Why is the knife reacting now?

1142
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:05,400
它自己就亮了!
It's lighting up all on its own!

1143
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:08,750
完全靠自己?一定很特别!
All on its own? It must be special!

1144
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:15,750
这是停止了。
It's stopped.

1145
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:19,740
为什么这么多人在找这个小东西?
Why are so many people looking for this little thing?

1146
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:23,750
即使今天受了那么多次伤，
Even after getting injured so many times today,

1147
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:26,050
你还是不能管好自己的手。
you still can't keep your hands to yourself.

1148
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:28,080
她只是想知道。
She was just wondering.

1149
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:29,540
正确的。只是思考。
Right. Just thinking aloud.

1150
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:34,680
我今天不再需要你的帮助了。
I will not be requiring your services any further today.

1151
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:36,700
走之前吃点晚饭。
Have some dinner before you go.

1152
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:38,700
你们三个在干什么?
What are you three doing?

1153
01:29:41,390 --> 01:29:45,030
我很想知道这里还发生了什么。
I'd be very interested to know  what else is going on around here.

1154
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:48,730
你看到刀了吗?
Did you see the knife?

1155
01:29:50,090 --> 01:29:51,400
我们晚上再来吧。
Let's come back at night.

1156
01:29:51,590 --> 01:29:53,170
很明显。
Obviously.

1157
01:29:53,230 --> 01:29:56,050
钱跟我们的一样好。
The money is as good as ours.

1158
01:29:57,490 --> 01:29:57,860
你。
You.

1159
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:00,410
把这个。
Take this.

1160
01:30:00,950 --> 01:30:03,640
把它交给后面的女孩，然后马上回来。
Give it to the girl out back and return immediately.

1161
01:30:03,910 --> 01:30:05,090
别跟她说话。
Don't speak to her.

1162
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:05,900
欢迎加入！
Yessir.

1163
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:07,780
你们两个。洗碗。
You two. Wash the dishes.

1164
01:30:10,670 --> 01:30:12,000
回来吗?
Out back?

1165
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:14,920
那是哪儿?
Where is that?

1166
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:32,770
多么美好的一天。就连鸟儿也这么认为。
Such a beautiful day. Even the birds think so.

1167
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:37,610
让我们看看，让我们看看。
Let's see, let's see.

1168
01:30:40,580 --> 01:30:42,260
哦,我明白了。
Oh, I see.

1169
01:30:42,690 --> 01:30:45,030
这里有一个小间隙。
And a little gap here.

1170
01:30:46,130 --> 01:30:47,860
他们是怎么做的?
How did they make this thing?

1171
01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:53,090
是火灾引起的吗?
Does the fire cause it?

1172
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:53,860
那么。
Well then.

1173
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:57,160
哦，这没什么用。
Oh, that didn't do anything.

1174
01:30:57,570 --> 01:30:58,090
该死的。
Darn.

1175
01:30:58,210 --> 01:30:59,040
嘿。
Hey.

1176
01:31:00,370 --> 01:31:02,010
你就是那个小偷吗?
Are you that thief?

1177
01:31:02,010 --> 01:31:03,120
小偷吗?这是严酷的。
Thief? That's harsh.

1178
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:05,160
在我给你带晚餐之后。
And after I brought you dinner.

1179
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:09,310
那朵花我也要吃吗?
Am I supposed to eat the flower too?

1180
01:31:09,310 --> 01:31:10,800
你为什么要这么做?
Why would you do that?

1181
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,630
所以你甚至会为了生存而吃花。
So you'll even eat flowers to survive.

1182
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:17,690
这么勇敢的女孩怎么会被关在这里?
How did such a brave girl wind up locked up out here?

1183
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:20,620
和你的理由一样。
Same reason as you.

1184
01:31:20,620 --> 01:31:21,730
你不是来拿刀的吗?
Aren't you here for the knife?

1185
01:31:21,890 --> 01:31:24,730
当然不是。我就住在那边。
Of course not. I live right over there.

1186
01:31:24,730 --> 01:31:25,610
你偷了吗?
Did you steal it yet?

1187
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:27,170
不,还没有。
No, not yet.

1188
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:29,610
但就在我出来之前，
But just before I came out here,

1189
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,710
我看到它开始发光
I saw it start glowing

1190
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:34,090
伴随着美丽柔和的蓝光。
With this beautiful, soft blue light.

1191
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:36,160
它照亮了吗?在你面前?
It lit up? In front of you?

1192
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:38,180
事情发生的时候我就在那儿，但是-
I was just there when it happened, but -

1193
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:39,460
但是等待。
But wait.

1194
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:43,280
我真的觉得我是在年轻的时候遇到你的。
I really feel like I met you when I was younger.

1195
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:44,500
但这是雾蒙蒙的。
But it's foggy.

1196
01:31:45,190 --> 01:31:47,610
如果你想告诉我你喜欢我，请别这样。
If you're about to tell me you like me, please don't.

1197
01:31:47,610 --> 01:31:49,320
我们并没有真正结婚。
We're not really married.

1198
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:54,530
不,听。我真的觉得如果我能记得那天……
No, listen. I really feel like if I could just remember that day...

1199
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:56,070
帮我记住。
Help me remember.

1200
01:31:57,290 --> 01:31:58,170
你来自哪里?
Where are you from?

1201
01:31:58,170 --> 01:31:58,890
你怎么来的?
How did you get here?

1202
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:01,680
你真的需要我的人生故事吗?
Do you really need my life story?

1203
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:05,330
小偷先生，你的生活离我远远的。
Mr. Thief, just live your life far away from me.

1204
01:32:05,330 --> 01:32:07,210
诚实地谋生。
Earn an honest living.

1205
01:32:07,610 --> 01:32:08,810
我就知道你会这么说。
I knew you'd say that.

1206
01:32:09,610 --> 01:32:11,830
那么，这有什么意义呢?
Now, what is the significance of this?

1207
01:32:13,090 --> 01:32:14,400
这是从哪里来的?
Where did this come from?

1208
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:15,740
雷声是怎么来的?
How does the thunder come out?

1209
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:16,920
不要拉!
Don't pull that!

1210
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:18,480
把它给我，小心点。
Give it to me, carefully.

1211
01:32:19,370 --> 01:32:22,180
首先，告诉我这把刀是从哪来的。
First, tell me where the knife came from.

1212
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:23,170
从未来。(未来)
From the future. (mirae)

1213
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:24,740
未来吗?
Mirae?

1214
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:29,090
未来吗?
Mirae?

1215
01:32:29,090 --> 01:32:31,400
等等，我也经历过。月清里附近
Wait, I've been there. That neighborhood by Wolcheongni -

1216
01:32:32,910 --> 01:32:33,680
不，那不对。
No, that's not right.

1217
01:32:35,530 --> 01:32:38,100
这是Miorae。
That was Miorae.

1218
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:39,320
那我还没去过。
I haven't visited, then.

1219
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:41,810
我来自600多年后的未来。
I came here from over 600 years in the future.

1220
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:43,230
你觉得怎么样?
What do you think of that?

1221
01:32:43,230 --> 01:32:45,080
所以我今天也得不到你的任何答复。
So I'm not getting  any answers from you today, either.

1222
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:47,880
哇。“你觉得怎么样?”板着脸问。
Wow. "What do you think of that?" with such a straight face.

1223
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:50,420
你得编个比这更好的谎话才能摆脱我。
You'll need a better lie than that to get rid of me.

1224
01:32:50,420 --> 01:32:52,260
你是说你住在那里。在未来。
So you're saying you live there. In the future.

1225
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:52,720
是的。
Yep.

1226
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:53,280
明白了吗?
Does that make sense?

1227
01:32:54,230 --> 01:32:56,080
等待。等等，放手，着火了
Wait. Wait, let go, there's fire -

1228
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:57,130
把枪给我。
Give me my gun.

1229
01:32:58,580 --> 01:32:59,390
火!我着火了!
Fire! I'm on fire!

1230
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:00,520
热了!
Hot!

1231
01:33:06,710 --> 01:33:08,040
那个人在哪里?
Where is that man?

1232
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:14,440
我会还给你的，但我想我会先把刀拿回来。
I'll give it back,  but I think I'll get the knife first.

1233
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:31,740
你在跟谁说话?
Who were you talking to?

1234
01:33:40,610 --> 01:33:40,820
我们走吧。
Let's go.

1235
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:13,560
[裁判官的记录]
[THE RECORD OF THE MAGISTRATE]

1236
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:14,660
这个女孩吗?
The girl?

1237
01:34:15,530 --> 01:34:16,910
她吃了食物。
She ate the food.

1238
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:18,500
她现在死了。
She's dying now.

1239
01:34:18,970 --> 01:34:19,590
埋葬她。
Bury her.

1240
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:21,010
把他们埋在一起。
Bury them both together.

1241
01:34:21,410 --> 01:34:22,210
理解。
Understood.

1242
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:24,700
把刀。
Bring the knife.

1243
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:26,140
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

1244
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:36,060
你知道我们有多久没吃米尔本的食物了吗?
Do you know how long it's been  since we ate Milbon's food?

1245
01:34:36,630 --> 01:34:38,170
十年吧，我想。
Ten years, I think.

1246
01:34:38,850 --> 01:34:39,720
我们先吃吧
Let's eat first and -

1247
01:34:43,690 --> 01:34:44,450
毒……的食物吗?
Poison... in the food?

1248
01:34:45,090 --> 01:34:45,990
那是谁?
Could it be?

1249
01:34:47,910 --> 01:34:49,090
让我们迅速行动。
Let's move quickly.

1250
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:50,350
在石化开始之前。
Before the petrification sets in.

1251
01:34:54,470 --> 01:34:55,310
的解药,很快。
The antidote, quickly.

1252
01:35:01,270 --> 01:35:02,040
僵化的
The petrification

1253
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:05,610
是多少。这里。
Is.  Here.

1254
01:35:27,580 --> 01:35:28,490
快点,快点。
Hurry, hurry.

1255
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:31,440
快，快，快，快。
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

1256
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:47,760
拉,拉。
Pull, pull.

1257
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:08,450
食物。毒药。
Food. Poison.

1258
01:36:10,090 --> 01:36:12,410
一个。Ti。溺爱。
An. Ti. Dote.

1259
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:13,810
解药?
Antidote?

1260
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:25,250
棺材是
Coffins are coming

1261
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,180
什么。棺材吗?
What. Coffins?

1262
01:36:28,870 --> 01:36:30,850
我们的!棺材!
Our! Coffins!

1263
01:36:31,490 --> 01:36:32,550
你是谁?
And who are you?

1264
01:37:03,970 --> 01:37:05,830
食物中有毒物。
Poison in the food.

1265
01:37:07,170 --> 01:37:07,490
食物有毒?
Poison in the food?

1266
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:10,760
食物中有毒物。
Poison in the food.

1267
01:37:14,530 --> 01:37:16,070
但我给了她一些食物。
But I gave her some of that food.

1268
01:37:17,350 --> 01:37:18,950
的解药。
The antidote.

1269
01:37:26,630 --> 01:37:29,000
那只老鼠混蛋。
That rat bastard.

1270
01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:53,180
在风中，在风中!
In the wind, of the wind!

1271
01:38:39,890 --> 01:38:41,540
如果你不介意的话……
If you'll excuse me...

1272
01:39:34,090 --> 01:39:34,690
主人!
Master!

1273
01:39:40,130 --> 01:39:41,090
得到他。
Get him.

1274
01:39:41,090 --> 01:39:42,470
森林!
To the forest!

1275
01:39:42,470 --> 01:39:43,210
抓住他们!
Catch them!

1276
01:39:55,210 --> 01:39:56,030
很热!
It's hot!

1277
01:39:56,970 --> 01:39:57,570
它太热了。
It's so hot.

1278
01:39:59,090 --> 01:40:01,770
热……
Hot...

1279
01:40:17,150 --> 01:40:18,210
热……
Hot...

1280
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:04,680
你刚刚是在擦嘴吗?
Did you just wipe your mouth?

1281
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:07,910
当然。我就不追究了。
Sure. I'll let that slide.

1282
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:11,610
我们去看看那个混蛋为什么要我们死。
Let's go find out why that bastard wants us dead.

1283
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:21,270
等待- - -
Wait-

1284
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:24,630
我带他们走。
I'll lead them away.

1285
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:30,100
他在那儿!得到他!
There he is! Get him!

1286
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:31,930
抓住他!
Catch him!

1287
01:41:33,470 --> 01:41:34,680
我必须回去。
I have to go back.

1288
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:35,750
待在这里。
Stay here.

1289
01:41:37,140 --> 01:41:38,130
不，你不能去。
No, you can't go.

1290
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:40,940
那个女人……
That woman...

1291
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:42,610
她可能会死。
She could die.

1292
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,420
Mureuk，你也可能会死。
Mureuk, you could also die.

1293
01:41:48,150 --> 01:41:48,660
没关系。
It's okay.

1294
01:41:49,250 --> 01:41:50,310
我马上回来。
I'll be right back.

1295
01:41:51,090 --> 01:41:51,900
在风中，在风中。
In the wind, of the wind.

1296
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:15,200
的解药。
The antidote.

1297
01:42:15,830 --> 01:42:17,080
我带了解药。
I brought the antidote.

1298
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:26,590
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

1299
01:42:28,090 --> 01:42:29,490
是我给你带来毒药的。
I'm the one who brought you the poison.

1300
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,010
我很抱歉。
I'm so sorry.

1301
01:42:32,870 --> 01:42:33,460
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

1302
01:42:42,230 --> 01:42:42,870
你做的很好。
You're doing great.

1303
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:44,120
你会没事的。
You'll be fine.

1304
01:43:28,430 --> 01:43:30,790
埋葬的女孩。把那个男孩扔进河里。
Bury the girl. Dump the boy in the river.

1305
01:43:33,860 --> 01:43:34,990
准备窑。
Prepare the kiln.

1306
01:43:35,180 --> 01:43:38,690
是时候回去了。
It's time to go back.

1307
01:43:50,740 --> 01:43:58,230
[不知这神秘的云从何而来…]
[It is not known where the mysterious cloud came from...]

1308
01:43:58,230 --> 01:44:01,400
[但我们敦促人们远离首尔的受灾地区。]
[But we are urging people to stay out of the affected areas of Seoul.]

1309
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:11,490
[官员们正在努力评估威胁，但目前还没有具体措施。]
[Officials are trying to evaluate the threat, but there is no word yet on what can be done.]

1310
01:44:12,450 --> 01:44:13,410
那是什么?
What's that?

1311
01:44:14,030 --> 01:44:15,800
这是我们的能量之源。
This is the source of our energy.

1312
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:17,590
有了这把刀的力量
With the power in this knife,

1313
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:19,540
我们可以抓住逃犯…
we can catch escaped criminals...

1314
01:44:19,890 --> 01:44:21,400
我们甚至可以改变时间，看过去。
We can even shift time, and see across it.

1315
01:44:22,630 --> 01:44:24,030
对我们来说，它不是线性的。
It isn't linear, for us.

1316
01:44:24,350 --> 01:44:25,460
这一切都同时存在。
It all exists at the same time.

1317
01:44:27,730 --> 01:44:28,570
当我们带你回来的时候…
When we brought you back...

1318
01:44:29,380 --> 01:44:30,710
我们以前就是这么做的。
This is what we used to do it.

1319
01:44:31,510 --> 01:44:34,520
如果我回去，就能救人了吗?
Then, if I went back, I could save people?

1320
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:35,520
我不是这个意思。
That's not what I mean.

1321
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:38,170
从某种意义上说，那些人已经死了。
In some sense, those people have already died.

1322
01:44:38,470 --> 01:44:41,260
这种能量变得越来越不稳定。
And this energy has become increasingly unstable.

1323
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:42,370
你不知道。
You have no idea.

1324
01:44:43,980 --> 01:44:48,250
我看到的未来……是断裂的。不清楚。
The future I see... Is fractured. Unclear.

1325
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:23,030
找到收集器。把这个武器给他。
Find the collector. Give him this weapon.

1326
01:45:31,990 --> 01:45:34,200
这里还有人，但他们都漂浮着。
There are people here but- they're floating.

1327
01:45:34,780 --> 01:45:35,800
我说，它们在漂浮!
I said, they're floating!

1328
01:46:00,690 --> 01:46:01,540
别碰,
Don't touch-

1329
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:09,010
我想我看到我自己…
I think I saw myself...

1330
01:46:14,450 --> 01:46:15,440
太久没见了。
It's been too long.

1331
01:46:18,170 --> 01:46:20,430
看来你还没有完全恢复体力。
It seems you are not restored to your full strength.

1332
01:46:21,050 --> 01:46:23,770
不，我还需要在这张表上多留一段时间。
No, I will need to stay in this form for a little while longer.

1333
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:28,830
恐怕我还不是我自己。
I am not yet myself, I fear.

1334
01:46:30,830 --> 01:46:33,030
至少有3名救护车工作人员在大雾中失踪。
At least 3 ambulance workers have been lost inside the fog.

1335
01:46:33,030 --> 01:46:38,070
正如你所看到的，它仍然相当厚，所以最好是计划替代路线暂时。
As you can see, it remains quite thick, so it is best to plan alternate routes for the time being.

1336
01:46:38,070 --> 01:46:41,910
此外，无人机还拍摄了一些神秘的画面
In addition, drones have filmed some mysterious footage-

1337
01:46:57,410 --> 01:46:59,320
这是之前的红色物质，对吧?
That's the red stuff from earlier, right?

1338
01:47:00,330 --> 01:47:01,700
人死亡。
People died.

1339
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:05,060
那只是一剂哈瓦。
That was only one dose of Haava.

1340
01:47:05,910 --> 01:47:07,220
他们拥有更多。
They have a lot more.

1341
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:08,530
在那艘船吗?
In that ship?

1342
01:47:09,530 --> 01:47:10,460
爸爸，你受伤了吗?
Dad, are you hurt?

1343
01:47:12,430 --> 01:47:12,890
我很好。
I'm fine.

1344
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:19,230
我得去处理那艘船了。
I have to go take care of that ship.

1345
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:22,490
很危险，我可能不会回来了，所以…
It's dangerous and I might not come back, so...

1346
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:25,730
我要告诉你一件重要的事。
I'll tell you something important.

1347
01:47:25,730 --> 01:47:26,620
你的妈妈。
About your mom.

1348
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:27,870
我的妈妈?
My mom?

1349
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:30,440
是我杀了她。
I was the one that killed her.

1350
01:47:32,680 --> 01:47:33,220
为什么?
Why?

1351
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:35,880
我需要杀死锁在她体内的东西。
I needed to kill the thing that was locked in her.

1352
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:39,080
我带你来是因为我需要你。
And I brought you here because I needed you.

1353
01:47:40,310 --> 01:47:41,090
如果我有个孩子…
If I had a child...

1354
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:43,860
我可以和人类生活在一起而不被发现。
I could live among humans without notice.

1355
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:46,550
但现在你却碍事了。
But now you're getting in the way.

1356
01:47:48,820 --> 01:47:49,590
所以我请你离开。
So I'll ask you to leave.

1357
01:47:51,580 --> 01:47:52,420
你就是在说谎。
You're lying.

1358
01:47:52,420 --> 01:47:53,590
机器人不会说谎。
Robots don't lie.

1359
01:47:55,570 --> 01:47:56,420
我去。
I'll go.

1360
01:47:57,210 --> 01:47:59,000
我知道你不是人类，但是…
I knew you weren't human, but...

1361
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:02,540
那就把我送回我来的地方。
Then send me back to where I came from.

1362
01:48:15,020 --> 01:48:17,790
你的应急储备只剩9%了
Your emergency reserves are down to 9%.

1363
01:48:18,100 --> 01:48:19,080
如果我走了，你的存活率
If I leave, your survival rate-

1364
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:20,500
我知道。停止讲话。
I'm aware. Stop talking.

1365
01:48:23,060 --> 01:48:24,120
伊安，在外面等一会儿。
Yian, wait outside for a moment.

1366
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:25,110
雷-
Thunder-

1367
01:48:25,110 --> 01:48:27,000
带她去明星家。我知道。
Take her to Minsung's house. I know.

1368
01:48:53,910 --> 01:48:55,590
你在画上写了什么?
What did you write on the picture?

1369
01:48:58,870 --> 01:49:00,670
(跑了,假。)
[Run away, dummy.]

1370
01:49:07,090 --> 01:49:07,610
雷声。
Thunder.

1371
01:49:07,610 --> 01:49:09,510
替我传达最后的讯息。
Deliver my final message for me.

1372
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:15,180
我们错了。像这样利用人类。
We were wrong. To use humans like this.

1373
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:19,650
但是守卫永远也跑不掉。
But Guards can never run away.

1374
01:49:19,650 --> 01:49:21,730
所以即使我没有足够的储备来赢得这场战斗…
So even if I don't have the reserves to win this fight...

1375
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:23,490
我必须遵守我的计划。
I must follow my program.

1376
01:49:24,090 --> 01:49:25,670
储备?这是什么意思?
Reserves? What does that mean?

1377
01:49:26,630 --> 01:49:27,520
而是他还能活多久。
It's how much life he has left.

1378
01:49:28,530 --> 01:49:29,530
他在一点点地消耗。
He's running out, little by little.

1379
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:32,140
现在……外汇储备为8%。
Right now... reserves are at 8%.

1380
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:35,090
生存的机会……
Odds of survival...

1381
01:49:35,290 --> 01:49:36,010
1%．
1%.

1382
01:50:32,290 --> 01:50:33,770
雷，我们得回去。
Thunder, we have to go back.

1383
01:50:34,110 --> 01:50:34,610
我不能。
I can't.

1384
01:50:35,330 --> 01:50:37,010
我得带你去安全的地方。
I have to take you to safety.

1385
01:50:37,380 --> 01:50:38,420
爸爸需要你。
Dad needs you.

1386
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:39,840
把车掉头。
Turn the car around.

1387
01:50:40,220 --> 01:50:41,360
你不可能帮他的。
There's no way you can help him.

1388
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:43,480
也许吧，但我的心告诉我，我们必须试试。
Maybe, but my heart says we have to try.

1389
01:50:44,310 --> 01:50:45,690
让我们回到爸爸身边。
Let's go back to Dad.

1390
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:01,960
那这个混蛋在哪儿?
So where is this bastard?

1391
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:04,070
警报已经打开了。
The alarm has been turned on.

1392
01:51:05,060 --> 01:51:07,080
我们吃完就走。
We should finish this and go.

1393
01:51:19,750 --> 01:51:20,630
你的心吗?
Your heart?

1394
01:51:21,150 --> 01:51:21,530
是的。
Yes.

1395
01:51:33,610 --> 01:51:34,630
人类的心脏真的很神奇。
Human hearts are really amazing.

1396
01:51:34,630 --> 01:51:35,810
为什么?
Why?

1397
01:51:36,190 --> 01:51:37,230
战斗成功的几率……
Odds of battle success...

1398
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:38,640
2%．
2%.

1399
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:39,480
3%。
3%.

1400
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:40,890
现在4%。
Now 4%.

1401
01:51:52,340 --> 01:51:53,610
准备部署。
Prepare deployment.

1402
01:51:56,900 --> 01:51:58,730
校准完成。
Calibrations complete.

1403
01:52:07,300 --> 01:52:08,230
我们差不多了。
We're almost there.

1404
01:52:08,380 --> 01:52:09,660
你为什么要回来?
Why are you coming back?

1405
01:52:09,660 --> 01:52:10,840
那艘船有个弱点…
That ship has a weakness...

1406
01:52:11,380 --> 01:52:12,980
内部系统和外部系统之间的联系……
The connection between the inner and outer systems...

1407
01:52:12,980 --> 01:52:14,690
那颗红心，记得吗?
That red heart, remember?

1408
01:52:17,250 --> 01:52:18,500
你在跟谁说话?
Who are you talking to?

1409
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:19,990
我把刀给你。
I'll get the knife to you.

1410
01:52:19,990 --> 01:52:20,600
让它进入心脏。
Get it into the heart.

1411
01:52:21,110 --> 01:52:22,050
现在移动。
Moving now.

1412
01:52:29,870 --> 01:52:30,410
得到它!

一直住在这里…

你为什么回来?

1419

雷，你在听吗?

在哪里?
Where is it?

1421
01:54:23,460 --> 01:54:24,030

我们阻止不了他们。

他们只会继续追我们。

爸爸!

他在车上!

走吧!
Go!

1431
01:55:11,160 --> 01:55:12,690
原来这是他的房间……
So this was his room...

1432
01:55:16,280 --> 01:55:17,370
和他的衣服吗?
And his clothes?

1433
01:55:20,440 --> 01:55:22,680
这……你觉得这像是时间记录吗?
Does this... look like a record of time to you?

如果是日历，那一定是3600天左右。
If it's a calendar, it must be about 3600 days.

1435
01:55:25,530 --> 01:55:26,610
他在做什么?
What's he been doing?

1436
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:27,890
他在等什么吗?
Is he waiting for something?

1437
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:33,560
Jungmoon Heuksol…这是我们。
Jungmoon, Heuksol... That's us.

1438

那是治安官，那是狗屎…
That's the magistrate, and that's Dogshit...

1439
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:47,400
看这里。他摧毁了一些东西。

高丽六年，黄延道。

天空打开了。一辆奇怪的马车从天上掉下来，后面拉着人。
The heavens opened. A strange carriage, pulling humans behind it, fell from the sky.

1443

01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:23,630
他们通过某种传送门来到这里。
They've come through some sort of portal.

1449

调查它。

1453
01:56:35,680 --> 01:56:36,830
到底发生了什么?

是很危险的!退后!

但它就在我们家旁边!
