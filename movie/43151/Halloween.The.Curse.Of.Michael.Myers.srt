迈克尔·迈尔斯六岁时
When Michael Myers was six years old,

10
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,660
他刺死了他妹妹
he stabbed his sister to death.

11

For years he was locked up,
locked away in Smith's Grove Sanitarium.

但他逃跑了
But he escaped.

万圣节是混乱的另一个词
Halloween was another word for mayhem.

15
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,600
他需要消灭整个家庭
He needed to wipe out his entire family.

16
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,610
He struck them down at night,
and always on Halloween.

17
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,700
The police tried
everything to stop him.

18
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:12,930
He overcame them all
and disappeared.

19
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,260
全世界都认为他死了
The world thought him dead,

20
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,800
但我      我不确定
But I... I wasn't sure.

21
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,220
I wasn't sure that
Michael Myers had died.

00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,910
And you're right.
I've come to celebrate?

144
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,080
你为什么听那个混蛋的
Why are you listening to that jerk?

145
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,370
哦  这是一个关于哈顿菲尔德的节目
Oh, it's a program about Haddonfield.

146
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,370
我正在录音
I'm taping it.

147
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,650
<i>So, who is responsible for getting</i>
<i>this Halloween rally thing together?</i>

148
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,650
<i>We are, the students of</i>
<i>Haddonfield junior college.</i>

149
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,950
<i>But why go to all the trouble</i>
<i>of throwing this soiree?</i>

150
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,340
<i>So what if Halloween has</i>
<i>been banned in Haddonfield?</i>

151
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,370
谁在乎
<i>Who gives a damn?</i>

152
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,870
<i>We do! We live here.</i>
<i>I mean, it's time we got on with our lives.</i>

153
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,370
明晚就是这样
<i>That's what tomorrow night is all about.</i>

154
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,540
<i>- This town is dying, Barry.</i>
<i>- Wow.</i>

155
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,920
<i>You know, I've heard Michael Myers blamed</i>
<i>for a lot of things tonight, but this is a first.</i>

156
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,460
他实际上扼杀了经济
<i>He's actually killed the economy!</i>

157
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,050
<i>Look, tomorrow night is</i>
<i>going to change all that,</i>

158
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,930
<i>especially after you do your</i>
<i>broadcast live from campus.</i>

159
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,260
<i>You have reached Haddonfield</i>
<i>Emergency Services.</i>

160
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,140
<i>Due to severe weather conditions,</i>
<i>all circuits are momentarily busy.</i>

161
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,060
如果这不是紧急情况…
<i>If this is not an emergency...</i>

162
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,980
你要和老酒吧一起上舞台吗
<i>You gonna get up there on the stage with old Bar'?</i>

163
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,650
<i>- Uh, yeah, I will.</i>
<i>- Yeah?</i>

164
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,070
<i>Well, I'll see you tomorrow night.</i>
<i>This is "Back Talk" with Barry Simms.</i>

165
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:37,540
<i>Give me a call at 1-800-968-7825.</i>
<i>That's 1-800-YOU-SUCK.</i>

166
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,710
<i>So come on, all you</i>
<i>boogeyman believers out there.</i>

167
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,250
给我打个电话
<i>Give me a call.</i>

168
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,830
今晚给我打电话
<i>Call me tonight.</i>

169
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,710
32年后
Well, after 32 years,

170
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,130
guess who is finally
relinquishing his duties

171
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,470
as chief administrator
of Smith's Grove?

172
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,890
- Good god, you don't mean to say you're—
- Retiring!

173
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,270
I came by to give you
the news myself.

174
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,100
好吧  我祝你好运  特伦斯
Well, I wish you well, Terence.

175
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,770
It's been in the planning
stages for some time now.

176
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,190
致老朋友…
To old friends...

177
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,070
退休…
To retirement...

178
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,950
新的开始
To new beginnings.

179
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,570
老朋友
Old friends.

180
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,290
山姆
Sam...

181
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,960
我要你回到史密斯的小树林
I want you to come back to Smith's Grove.

182
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:34,590
You should know that it's not wise
to play Halloween pranks on me.

183
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:39,390
It's no prank. You are the one I've chosen, Sam.
I want you to come back.

184
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,770
After my stroke six years ago they
practically had to hold a pistol

185
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,480
为了让我退休  但…
to my head to get me to retire, but...

186
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:51,190
Things are different now.
I'm different.

187
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:56,360
I've buried the ghosts.
I've buried them in this manuscript.

188
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,990
我不想再行医了
I don't want to practice medicine anymore.

189
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:03,500
<i>- They're coming! They're coming!</i>
<i>- Yeah. So they're coming, they're coming.</i>

190
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,620
别告诉我  你叫琼…
<i>Don't tell me, your name is Joan...</i>

191
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,330
<i>Joan of Arc, and you're also</i>
<i>hearing voices, right?</i>

192
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,500
现在  谁来了
<i>Now, who's coming?</i>

193
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,090
是迈克尔
<i>It's Michael.</i>

194
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,970
迈克尔·迈尔斯
<i>Michael Myers.</i>

195
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,840
听着  有人  任何人…
<i>Look, someone, anyone...</i>

196
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,720
帮助我  卢米斯医生  你在外面吗
<i>Help me. Dr. Loomis, are you out there?</i>

197
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:24,770
<i>- Can you hear me? Dr. Loomis, I need your help.</i>
<i>- Please, please. No, no, stop. Stop that.</i>

198
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,190
今晚到底怎么回事
<i>What the hell is going on tonight?</i>

199
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,650
<i>Every looney in the state is calling.</i>
<i>What is this? A full moon?</i>

200
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,280
<i>Oh, man. I guess Halloween</i>
<i>brings out all the wackos.</i>

201
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,280
<i>I can't wait until we get</i>
<i>to Haddonfield tomorrow.</i>

202
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,160
嘘  嘘
Shhh. Shhhh.

203
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,980
没关系
It's okay.

204
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,790
对  没关系
Yes. It's alright.

205
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,990
嘘  对
Shhh. Yes.

206
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,490
没关系
It's okay.

207
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,870
不
No!

208
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,840
别管我们
Leave us alone!

209
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,040
你不能生孩子  迈克尔
You can't have the baby, Michael.

210
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,750
你不能生孩子
You can't have the baby.

211
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,830
够了…
Enough...

212
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,660
迈克尔·迈尔斯…
of this Michael Myers...

213
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:39,870
瞎扯
bullshit!

214
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,630
Now, you stinking kids got about three
seconds to get the hell off my property!

215
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,640
One!
Two!

216
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,470
是杰米·劳埃德
It was Jamie Lloyd.

217
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,550
那是六年前  山姆
That was six years ago, Sam.

218
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,890
You know she died with
him in that explosion.

219
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,580
- You know it!
- That's what someone would like us to believe.

220
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:47,860
But I tell you Michael is alive.
I can feel his evil heart beating,

221
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:52,070
I can see him just as I
did all those years ago

222
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,240
在同样的墙后面
behind these very same walls.

223
00:24:55,450 --> 00:25:02,460
Staring, staring.
Always growing stronger.

224
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:13,130
Please. As my colleague, as my
friend, I can't go through this again.

225
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,140
不止一个人
Not alone.

226
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,390
I need your help
to stop him.

227
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,900
Dr. Wynn, I didn't
expect you in this morning.

228
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,280
Donna, this is Dr. Loomis,
the man I was telling you about.

229
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,030
Oh, yes. It's a pleasure
to meet you, doctor.

230
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,400
It will be wonderful to
have you back at the hospital.

231
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,370
Dr. Wynn, there's
something you should know.

232
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,830
Donna, I'd like you to get
Dr. Loomis anything he needs.

233
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,420
Files, tests, records of every
treatment we've ever administered

234
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,750
to a former patient of
ours, Michael Myers.

235
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,930
- Michael Myers?
- Is something wrong?

236
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:58,100
I just received a phone call.
That girl Jamie Lloyd...

237
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,510
Her body was found this
morning near Haddonfield.

238
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,210
Notify the Haddonfield sheriff;
tell him we're on the way.

239
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,980
我要全体员工保持警惕
I want the entire staff on alert.

240
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:10,650
We go to code red lockdown
for twenty-four hours.

241
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,860
If that maniac
is really out there...

242
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,860
我计划带他回来
I plan to bring him back.

243
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,270
活着
Alive.

244
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,740
喂  G  是吗
Yo, G, wassup?!

245
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:23,120
Barry's my
homeboy from Chicago.

246
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,620
是的  巴里·西姆斯
Yes, that Barry Simms.

247
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,000
Beth and I are
down on this gig.

248
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,410
丹尼
Danny.

249
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:33,800
Look, you just bring the posse
tonight, and we'll hook you up.

250
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,010
王牌
Ace.

251
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,680
Doesn't Danny look cute
dressed up as his Uncle Tim?

252
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,060
Great. Now I've got a six-year-old
gang member for a son.

253
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,310
很完美
Perfect.

254
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,730
This is the famous Tim
Strode stomach pounder.

255
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,400
- You down for the challenge?
- Hit me, G.

256
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,740
很好  丹  伙计
Good try, Dan man.

257
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,700
你最好还是喝橙汁
You better stick to orange juice.

258
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,540
什叶派
Shitheads.

259
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,540
破坏我的财产
Defacing my property.

260
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,750
- I showed them.
- John, they were just kids.

261
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,420
Kids, my dear Deborah, are
what's ruining this country.

262
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:18,260
Everywhere you go it's the same damn thing.
There's no goddamn respect.

263
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,050
我休息一下
I rest my case.

264
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:28,060
Kara, you'll never pass that
exam on an empty stomach.

265
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:34,400
"Cognitive therapy and emotional disorders".
What are they teaching you in college these days?

266
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,650
疯狂的艺术
The art of going crazy?

267
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,570
这叫心理学  妈妈
It's called psychology, mom.

268
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,700
Living in this house is
enough to drive anyone crazy.

269
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:41,840
哦  是吗
Oh, yeah?

270
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,700
Well, who the hell asked you to
come back here in the first place?

271
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,210
我最好送丹尼去学校
I better get Danny to school.

272
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:51,840
Doesn't show her face around
her own family for five years...

273
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,500
then comes back and expects
us to roll out the red carpet.

274
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,630
You think going to college is gonna
make up for your mistakes, girl?

275
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,050
- John, please.
- Lay off her, dad.

276
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,510
我们走吧  丹尼
Let's go, Danny.

277
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,720
Kara, wait, please. John, can't we just
sit down for once and try to be a family?

278
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,060
对不起  妈妈
Sorry, Mom.

279
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,150
Oh, yeah, that's it, Deborah.
Just keep slipping her the cash.

280
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,650
You know, while you're at it,
I got a great idea. Here.

281
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,940
Why don't you give her
all of our goddamn money?

282
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,860
你为什么不让她一个人呆着
Why don't you leave her alone?

283
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,860
没有什么改变  是吗
Nothing ever changes, does it?

284
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,490
你必须醒来
You've gotta wake up.

285
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,280
我有消息要告诉你  姑娘
I got news for you, girl.

286
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,500
Before you came around,
everything was going fine.

287
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,250
直到你登上我们的门台阶
Until you landed on our doorstep.

288
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,170
你和那个小…
You and that little...

289
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,540
你的混蛋
bastard of yours.

290
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,050
我只看到这房子里有一个混蛋
I see only one bastard in this house.

291
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,270
丹尼…
Danny...

292
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,150
离她远点
Get away from her!

293
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,860
-你闭嘴  别插嘴
- You shut up and stay outta this!

294
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,940
- John, please, don't!
- Kill for him.

295
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:01,700
You ever talk to me like that again
and so help me God...

296
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,660
你明白吗
You understand?

297
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,470
把刀给我  丹尼
Give me the knife, Danny.

298
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:37,610
嘿
Hey...

299
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:42,030
Hey. Make way for the Hardin County Express.
Where's Tim?

300
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,520
We're supposed to go over
the list of events for tonight.

301
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:48,830
Oh, God.
Did he do that to you?

302
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,540
Another episode of "Father
Knows Best" at the Strode house.

303
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,960
这次到底发生了什么
What the hell happened this time?

304
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,710
- What's gotten into you?
- Just glad to see you, that's all.

305
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,960
你们还好吧
You guys okay?

306
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:05,220
Tonight's the night we bring
some life back into this town.

307
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,850
Shit, Beth, why do we have to be
the ones to organize this friggin' fair?

308
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,260
我是说  这只是万圣节
I mean, it's only Halloween.

309
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,100
How many times do I have to tell you.
It's not about Halloween.

310
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,310
Now, Danny, you know Grandpa
didn't really hurt me, right?

311
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,520
对  妈妈
Right, Mom.

312
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:22,820
Well, you'd better
go catch your bus.

313
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,860
But tonight when you come home
we'll go trick-or-treating, okay?

314
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,740
可以
Okay.

315
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:31,160
- I love you, Danny.
- I love you, Mommy.

316
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,950
给我挤一下
Give me a squeeze.

317
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,340
是啊  可以
Yeah. Okay.

318
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,260
I just can't live with her
anymore, Deborah.

319
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:52,220
你不明白  是吗
You don't understand, do you?

320
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,180
It's not about Kara,
it's about you.

321
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,230
I don't care what she's done;
she's your daughter.

322
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,530
她不再是我的女儿了
She's not my daughter anymore.

323
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,860
Beth, who's that guy who
lives across the hall from you?

324
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,700
为什么  你感兴趣
Why, you interested?

325
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,030
是的  对
Yeah, right.

326
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,370
他总是盯着窗外看
He's always staring out his window.

327
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,000
昨晚  我看到他在看我
Last night, I caught him watching me.

328
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,330
那一定是汤米
That must be Tommy.

329
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,330
以1到10的奇怪比例
On a weirdness scale of one to ten,

330
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,250
他估计13分左右
he rates about a 13.

331
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,840
Supposedly some scary shit happened
to him, when he was a kid.

332
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,510
把他的头弄得很乱
Messed up his head pretty bad.

333
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,920
不过  他是无害的
He's harmless, though.

334
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:30,220
- He's probably just lonely.
- Or horny.

335
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,350
你可能已经有一段时间没有感觉到了
Something you probably haven't felt in a while.

336
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,600
提姆
Tim...

337
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:37,180
万圣节快乐  布兰肯希普太太
Happy Halloween, Mrs. Blankenship!

338
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:41,690
Best part about living in that boarding house is
that crazy old lady wouldn't hear a truck

339
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,100
开车穿过她的起居室
drive through her living room.

340
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,480
Please. Look, you've gotta listen to me!
They're coming! They're coming!

341
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:50,280
Yeah, so they're coming, they're coming.
Don't tell me. Your name is Joan...

342
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,070
圣女贞德  你也听到了声音  对吗
Joan of Arc and you're also hearing voices, right?

343
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,200
来吧  现在  谁来了
Come on. Now, who's coming?

344
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,830
是迈克尔
It's Michael.

345
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,460
迈克尔·迈尔斯
Michael Myers.

346
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,920
看  有人  任何人  帮助我
Look, someone, anyone, help me.

347
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,840
Dr. Loomis, are you out there?
Can you hear me, Dr. L...

348
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,930
It's Michael.
Michael Myers.

349
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,020
...your attention, please.
Bus 611 from Pontiac...

350
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:20,140
Look, someone, anyone, help me.
Dr. Loomis, are you out there?

351
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,190
你能听见吗  卢米斯医生  我需要你的帮助
Can you hear me, Dr. Loomis? I need your help.

352
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:25,520
- God, please, help.
- May I have your attention, please?

353
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:29,650
34路公共汽车从皮奥里亚  鲁塞尔维尔和加德纳出发…
Bus 34 from Peoria, Russelville and Gardner...

354

356
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:39,830
Ticketed passengers, please wait inside
the door until arrival of bus number 34.

357
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,460
先生  需要我帮忙吗
Can I help you, sir?

358
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,840
Can you tell me if a bus arrived
from Pontiac last night?

359
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:57,890
当然有
Sure did.

360
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,560
- Are you looking for someone?
- Thank you.

361
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,390
请注意一下好吗
May I have your attention, please?

362
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,100
Bus number 34,
service to Chicago,

363
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:44,770
has arrived and is now ready for
boarding through the side doors.

364
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,350
Jesus
Jesus.

365
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:28,470
嘘  嘘
Shhh. Shhh.

366
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,530
不  没关系
No. It's okay.

367
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,070
没关系  没关系  没关系  伙计
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, man.

368
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,240
It's okay.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

369
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,260
天哪  那是什么
Good God, what's that?

370
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,720
它是…他的印记
It's... his mark.

371
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,220
他回来了
He's come home.

372
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:08,690
亲爱的上帝
Dear God.

373
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,770
杰米
Jamie.

374
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,780
现在只有上帝能帮助她  先生
Only God can help her now, sir.

375
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,820
Sam, don't.
Let them take care of her.

376
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:22,160
- Doctor Loomis.
- Yeah.

377
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,120
他们告诉我你会来的
They told me you'd be coming.

378
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,870
Now I suggest you go right on
back to your crackpot asylum.

379
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,670
You people got no
business in my town.

380
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:34,130
迈克尔·迈尔斯是我的事
Michael Myers is my business.

381
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,760
It's been quiet here for six years
and that's the way it's gonna stay,

382
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:41,550
and the last thing I need now is you
going around spouting off ghost stories.

383
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,970
I suppose it was a ghost
that did all this, then.

384
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,810
It was a ghost talking
on the radio last night.

385
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,270
That's a ghost being
carried out of here right now?!

386
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,260
哟  看看
Yo, check it out!

387
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,760
今晚会是杀手
Tonight's gonna be killer.

388
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,010
Kara, I swear. One of these days,
you're gonna get lost in that thing.

389
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:29,140
- I can't find my term paper.
- So copy someone else's. I do it all the time.

390
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,560
工作原理
Works primo.

391
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,980
哦  该死
Oh, shit!

392
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,860
Looks like your little boy has got
himself quite an imagination.

393
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,570
他一直做噩梦
He's been having nightmares.

394
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,700
我觉得很酷
I think it's cool.

395
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:52,040
- Must be some nightmares.
- Beth, we got work to do.

396
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:55,790
嘿
Hey...

397
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,460
你会没事吧
Are you gonna be okay?

398
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,510
荆棘
"Thorn"?

399
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:56,350
我需要看医生
I need to see a doctor.

400
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,980
- What seems to be the problem?
- Uh, it's my baby.

401
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,440
发生了一起事故
There's been an accident.

402
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:03,900
- What kind of accident?
- Get me a doctor! Now!

403
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,870
安全
Security?

404
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,740
Sam, there's nothing you
can do for her now.

405
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,670
卢米斯医生
Dr. Loomis?

406
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,210
是啊
Yeah.

407
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,670
卢米斯医生…
Dr. Loomis...

408
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,840
感谢上帝你在这里
Thank God you're here.

409
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,800
You heard her last night, didn't you?
It was Jamie.

410
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,890
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

411
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,270
- I don't know you, do I?
- I'm Tommy.

412
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,980
汤米·道尔
Tommy Doyle.

413
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:38,860
Laurie Strode, Jamie's mother, was
baby-sitting me the night when...

414
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,320
汤米·道尔
Tommy Doyle.

415
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,070
你在这里干什么
What're you doing here?

416
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,700
拜托
Please...

417
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,780
我需要知道真相
I need to know the truth.

418
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,240
Michael Myers has come
home, hasn't he?

419
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,750
What do you know
about Michael?

420
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:57,170
我知道他还在外面
I know he's still out there.

421
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,570
People in this town,
they want us to believe he's dead,

422
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,460
but I know.
I've always known.

423
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:05,590
She's out there fighting for her life.
If she should die...

424
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:10,850
- She is the last of his bloodline.
- No, Dr. Loomis.

425
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,060
她不是最后一个
She's not the last.

426
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,270
哦  天哪
Oh, God.

427
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,350
There's a family. Relatives of
the people who adopted Laurie:

428
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,690
大步前进
the Strodes.

429
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,070
他们住在迈尔斯家
They're living in the Myers house.

430
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,190
卢米斯医生  关于迈克尔…
Dr. Loomis, about Michael...

431
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,450
- It's just a theory of mine of...
- That's him.

432
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,080
Meet me tonight.
9:00 at the campus rally.

433
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,370
汤米  等等
Tommy, wait!

434
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,540
等待
Wait!

435
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,250
汤米  等等
Tommy, wait!

436
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:41,750
哦  你来了
Oh, there you are.

437
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,290
那个男孩是谁
Who is that boy?

438
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,760
一个老朋友
An old friend.

439
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,420
伟大的
Great.

440
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:10,480
我很抱歉  斯特罗德夫人
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Strode.

441
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,650
一切都好吗
Is everything all right?

442
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,150
你是谁
Who are you?

443
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,990
我来帮助你的家人
I came to help your family.

444
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,520
嘘  嘘
Shh. Shh.

445
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,140
没关系
It's okay.

446
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:44,430
可以
Okay.

447
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:46,770
史提芬
Steven.

448
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:49,110
你喜欢那个名字吗
You like that name?

449
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,020
是的  我觉得它适合你
Yeah, I think it suits you.

450
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:06,000
没关系  没关系
It's okay. It's alright.

451
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,500
我不会让任何事情发生在你身上的
I won't let anything happen to you.

452
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:21,890
For 15 years I've been obsessed to find
out what was going on inside of him.

453
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:27,180
It's been my life's work,
and my ultimate failure.

454
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:33,690
This force, this thing that lived inside
of him came from a source too violent,

455
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,610
太致命了  你无法想象  它…
too deadly for you to imagine. It...

456
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:39,530
它在他体内生长
It grew inside him.

457
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,330
污染他的灵魂
Contaminating his soul.

458
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:45,790
是…
It was...

459
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,080
纯粹的邪恶
pure evil.

460
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,170
- What makes you think he'll come back here?
- This house...

461
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,460
is sacred to him.
He has all his memories here.

462
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,210
他的愤怒
His rage!

463
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,260
斯特罗德夫人…
Mrs. Strode...

464
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:01,440
我求求你
I beg of you.

465
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:07,020
Don't let your family suffer the same
fate that Laurie and her daughter suffered.

466
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,770
- Jamie? I... I thought that she—
- She's been found.

467
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:17,070
在哈顿菲尔德外面  被刺伤了
Outside Haddonfield, stabbed.

468
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,370
我该怎么办
What should I do?

469
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:29,660
I really am sorry, but you haven't
a moment to lose, Mrs. Strode.

470
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:35,420
Michael Myers has come
back to Haddonfield to kill.

471
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,920
大步走房地产
Strode Real Estate.

472
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:43,390
约翰  发生了可怕的事
John, something terrible's happened.

473
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,220
你现在想要什么  黛博拉
What do you want now, Deborah?

474
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:49,230
A man came by the house,
a psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.

475
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:53,770
And he told me about the terrible things
that happened here in our house.

476
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:57,090
Deborah, what the hell are you doing?
Talking to strangers, letting 'em in our house?

477
00:44:57,190 --> 00:45:00,280
John, they found Jamie Lloyd this morning.
Someone tried to kill her.

478
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:02,580
Deborah, I don't know what
the hell you're talking about.

479
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,410
You ought to stop watching
those damn TV talkshows.

480
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,280
我要把孩子们带出去
I'm getting the children out of here.

481
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:09,580
至少在我知道发生了什么之前
At least until I know what's going on.

482
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,380
约翰  我要你和我们一起去
John, I want you to come with us.

483
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:16,500
你知道的  你知道  黛博拉
You know. You know, Deborah.

484
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:20,010
You've lost it. You know that, Deborah?
You've just lost it.

485
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,510
你把我们搬进这房子的原因…
The reason you moved us into this house...

486
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:26,350
Your brother could never sell it
because of what happened here, could he?

487
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,010
你知道的
And you knew.

488
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,890
你没有告诉我们  约翰
And you didn't tell us, John.

489
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,890
你知道
You knew.

490
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:36,610
该死的
Goddamnit!

491
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:05,890
万圣节快乐  小女孩
Happy Halloween, little girl.

492
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:51,500
你好
Hello?

493
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,390
我们想要孩子
We want the child.

494
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:55,020
这是谁
Who is this?

495
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:27,220
哦  迈克尔
Oh, Michael.

496
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:42,080
我来了
<i>I'm coming.</i>

497
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,520
是的  我……
Yeah, I'm...

498
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:49,070
准备好  哦  是的  是啊  对
<i>Get ready, oh, yes! Yeah. Yes.</i>

499
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,740
<i>I'm coming, all right, and you'd better</i>
<i>be there at the Halloween Harvest fair.</i>

500
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:55,160
让我们一起做吧
<i>Let's do it, together.</i>

501
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:15,550
对不起的.
Sorry.

502
00:48:56,930 --> 00:48:59,220
妈妈  我回家了
Mom? I'm home!

503
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,230
你好
Hello?

504
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,060
妈妈
Mom!

505
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,050
妈妈
Mom?

506
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:32,650
妈妈
Mom?

507
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,560
丹尼
Danny?

508
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:58,430
妈妈
Mom?

509
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:00,800
你在吗
Are you there?

510
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:05,990
你在这里干什么
What are you doing here?

511
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:14,800
我是你街对面的邻居
I'm your neighbor from across the street.

512
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:18,010
- Tommy Doyle.
- What are you doing with my son?

513
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:19,800
而且…我妈妈呢
And... and where's my mother?

514
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:23,300
她不在这里…当丹尼回家的时候
She wasn't here... when Danny came home.

515
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,970
丹尼  下楼去
Danny, go downstairs.

516
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:28,390
But Tommy's my new friend.
He knows all about dinosaurs.

517
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:34,610
你有危险  跟我来
You're in danger. Come with me.

518
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,290
你好  B太太
Hi, Mrs. B!

519
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:08,020
你真的不希望我们呆在这里  是吗
You don't really expect us to stay here, do you?

520
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:11,600
I want you to watch your house.
You can see everything from that window.

521
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:14,980
你知道这有多疯狂吗
Do you know how insane this is?

522
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:16,730
我该找谁
Who am I supposed to be looking for?

523
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:18,650
他
Him.

524
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,830
是啊  没关系
Yeah. It's okay.

525
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,080
没关系  史蒂文
It's okay, Steven.

526
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,010
妈妈
Mommy!

527
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:41,760
妈妈
Mom!

528
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:44,220
现在不行  丹尼
Not now, Danny.

529
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:03,650
干得好
Here you go.

530
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,360
来吧
Come on.

531
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:07,660
什么
What?

532
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,710
在这里  让我试试
Here. Let me try.

533
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:19,750
那里
There.

534
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:23,380
那里
There.

535
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:27,050
看到了吗
See?

536
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:30,510
只需要母亲的触摸
All it takes is a mother's touch.

537
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:40,920
Uncle Michael, please don't hurt me.
Oh, God, please forget me.

538
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,060
你的工作现在完成了  杰米
Your work is done now, Jamie.

539
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:11,820
我又让你失望了  杰米
I let you down again, Jamie.

540
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:17,290
我不应该离开你
I never should have left you.

541
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,920
符文是一种…早期字母表…
Runes were a kind of... early alphabet...

542
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:26,670
它起源于约公元前500年的北欧
that originated in Northern Europe about 500 B.C.

543
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:32,720
They were symbols carved out
of stone or pieces of wood,

544
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:36,810
used in pagan rituals to portend
future events and invoke magic.

545
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:43,480
Of all the runes, Thorn had
the most negative influence.

546
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:48,110
Among the ancient druids, Thorn
represented a demon that spread

547
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:53,570
sickness, destroyed crops, and brought
death to hundreds of thousands of people.

548
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:56,950
According to a Celtic legend,
one child from each tribe

549
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,160
被选择用荆棘诅咒
was chosen to be inflicted with a curse of Thorn.

550
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:04,290
To offer the blood sacrifices of its
next of kin on the night of Samhain.

551
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,490
万圣节
Halloween.

552
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:10,300
The sacrifice of one family meant
sparing the lives of an entire tribe.

553
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:14,430
So why are you so concerned
about us if Michael's only out

554
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,610
杀了他的家人
to kill his family?

555
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:18,680
In his mind, anyone living
in his house is his family.

556
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:22,940
For years I've been convinced
there must be some reason.

557
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:25,810
迈克尔疯狂背后的某种方法
Some method behind Michael's madness.

558
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:28,530
我发现的共同点是索恩
And the common link I found is Thorn.

559
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,120
The druids were also great
mathematicians and astronomers.

560
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:39,080
The Thorn symbol is
actually constellation of stars

561
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:41,710
that appears from time to
time on Halloween night.

562
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:45,500
无论什么时候出现  他都会出现
Whenever it appears, he appears.

563
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:51,840
I've traced it back to 1963,
when Michael murdered his sister, Judith.

564
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:55,390
The next time was in 1978; Michael
escapes from Smith's Grove.

565
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:58,310
It happened a decade later,
and the year after that. He kills again.

566
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:03,140
Now Jamie says Michael is back,
and for the first time in 6 years,

567
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:05,310
Thorn reappears.
Coincidence?

568
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:10,900
What would happen if he succeeded,
if he killed the last member of his family?

569
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,070
好吧  迈克尔的权力将终结
Well, Michael's power would end,

570
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:19,030
and the curse would be
passed on to another child.

571
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:25,420
我想这就是为什么这些人
I think that's why these people,

572
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:28,500
whoever they are,
are after Jamie's baby.

573
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:32,510
让它成为迈克尔最后的牺牲
To make it Michael's final sacrifice.

574
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,140
你要去哪里
Where are you going?

575
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:45,560
To find the only man who can
stop him before it's too late.

576
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:46,940
哦  不  丹尼在哪里
Oh, no. Where's Danny?

577
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,560
丹尼
Danny?

578
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:51,680
丹尼
Danny!

579
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:52,940
布兰肯希普夫人
Mrs. Blankenship!

580
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:54,830
你看到了吗…
Have you seen...

581
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:58,110
Danny, don't ever walk off without
telling me where you're going!

582
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,660
带他上楼
Take him upstairs.

583
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,910
锁上门  等我回来
Lock the door and wait till I get back.

584
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:03,740
卡拉…
Kara...

585
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,210
无论你做什么…
Whatever you do...

586
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,630
别回你家去
Don't go back to your house.

587
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:16,880
You let him get to her!
How could you?

588
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:21,430
Dr. Loomis, during surgery we discovered
that Jamie's uterus was hemorrhaging,

589
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,430
我们找到了这个
and we found this.

590
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,440
是胎盘液
It's placental fluid.

591
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,690
上帝在天堂  你是说-
Good God in heaven, do you mean to say—

592
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:33,650
I estimate she gave birth
no more than 24 hours ago.

593
00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:37,150
Then the question is:
Where is the baby?

594
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:41,530
I think I...
I may already know.

595
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,220
你知道我们为什么要庆祝万圣节吗
Do you know why we celebrate Halloween?

596
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:04,640
Because that's when we go
trick-or-treating and get candy.

597
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:06,020
哦  好吧……
Oh, well...

598
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:07,640
是的  但是……
Yes, but...

599
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:10,730
很久很久以前
A long, long time ago,

600
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:16,650
it was a night of great power,
when the days grew short

601
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:19,030
以及死者的灵魂
and the spirits of the dead

602
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:24,740
returned to their homes to
warm themselves by the fireside.

603
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:30,120
全国各地都点燃了巨大的篝火
All across the land huge bonfires were lit.

604
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:33,790
哦  有一个精彩的庆祝活动
Oh, there was a marvelous celebration.

605
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:37,300
人们跳舞  玩游戏
People danced and they played games.

606
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:40,180
他们穿着盛装
And they dressed up in costumes.

607
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:45,430
希望能驱除恶灵
Hoping to ward off the evil spirits.

608
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,020
尤其是乡巴佬
Especially the boogeyman.

609
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,440
什么是妖怪
What's the boogeyman?

610
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:55,190
Come on, Danny.
Say good night to Mrs. Blankenship.

611
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,610
- Good night, Mrs. Blankenship.
- He hears the voice, you know.

612
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:01,950
就像住在那房子里的另一个男孩一样
Just like the other boy that lived in that house.

613
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,200
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

614
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:08,580
那天晚上我和他一起照看孩子
I was baby-sitting with him that night.

615
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,710
住在街对面的小米奇·迈尔斯
Little Mikey Myers that lived across the street.

616
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:16,960
And that's when the voice came,
the night he murdered his sister.

617
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:18,800
迈克尔听到声音了吗
Michael heard a voice?

618
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:22,930
它告诉他要杀了他的家人
It told him to kill his family.

619
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:37,150
- Where the hell's Barry? Let's go!
- Don't get star-struck on me now.

620
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:42,650
We got a real agenda here, and Barry
is gonna help us get the message out.

621
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,200
嘿  看……
Hey, look...

622
01:01:56,040 --> 01:02:00,440
喂  哈登菲尔德
Helloooo, Haddonfield!

623
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:08,390
- Barry!
- WKNB presents "Back Talk" with Barry Simms.

624
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,890
- live from Haddonfield, Illinois,
- Barry!

625
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:14,140
迈克尔·迈尔斯的家
the home of Michael Myers!

626
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,650
黛博拉
Deborah!

627
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:25,950
我回家了
I'm home!

628
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:30,030
谢谢你的晚餐
Thanks for the dinner.

629
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:39,880
出来  出来…
Come out, come out...

630
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:41,300
无论你在哪里
Wherever you are.

631
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:52,640
该死的
Goddamnit.

632
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,140
她真的走了
She actually left.

633
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:04,440
我知道发生了什么事
I know what's going on.

634
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:09,820
一定是个乡巴佬
It must be the boogeyman.

635
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,910
我来了  笨蛋
Here I come, boogeyman.

636
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,790
因为  你知道  我真的很害怕
'Cause, you know, I am really scared.

637
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,320
我勒个去
What the hell?

638
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:50,820
电源断开了
The power's off.

639
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,580
告诉我  孩子们  感觉如何…
Tell me, kids, how's it feel to...

640
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:29,670
finally pull Halloween out of
the proverbial Haddonfield closet?

641
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,260
我们要说的是…
What we're saying here is...

642
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:35,600
we will no longer let the powers
that be control our minds.

643
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:36,970
多年来…
For years...

644
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:40,730
Halloween has represented everything
that's wrong with Haddonfield.

645
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:43,310
但是迈可·迈尔斯已经走了很久
But Michael Myers is long gone.

646
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:46,610
没有妖怪
There is NO boogeyman!

647
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:47,810
哇
Whoa!

648
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:51,190
提姆  她会在麻袋里被激怒吗
Does she get this riled up in the sack, Tim?

649
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:55,110
I bet she wears crotchless
panties and barks like a dog.

650
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,320
贝丝……
Beth...

651
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,080
What do you say, honey?
You and me, uh...

652
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,000
就像我说的…
As I was saying...

653
01:06:03,330 --> 01:06:05,290
我们必须停止行动  因为恐惧
We have to stop acting out of fear.

654
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:07,790
看看蒂姆的家人
Just look at Tim's family.

655
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:10,590
他们住在迈尔斯家
They live in the Myers house.

656
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:13,220
是吗
You do?

657
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:14,760
我们怎么办
We do?

658
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,720
休斯敦大学      是的  我们知道
Uh... yeah, we do.

659
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:19,720
好房子
Great house.

660
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:23,810
- Strong wood.
- I see. You mean to tell me you actually live...

661
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:25,270
在房子里…
in the house...

662
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:28,310
of the most brutal
mass murderer in history?

663
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:33,110
这是巴里·西姆斯的节目
This is the Barry Simms show.

664
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,030
当我们回来的时候…
And when we return...

665
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:37,280
我们会在你的现场…
we'll be coming at you live...

666
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:38,490
从那个…
from the one...

667
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:39,620
唯一的…
the only...

668
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:42,410
Myers house.
How's that for a Halloween shock-fest?

669
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:45,990
孩子  离你家有多远
How far to your house, kid?

670
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:48,170
大约半英里  但我不知道我的家人是否…
About half a mile, but I don't know if my folks...

671
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:49,690
Good, I'll meet you
there in five.

672
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,220
What about the kids?
We're supposed to throw all the candy.

673
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,230
电话
Phone!

674
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:54,760
别紧张  亲爱的
Relax your crack, sweetheart.

675
01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:57,890
Quick tootle around the old household
and we'll be right on back.

676
01:06:58,090 --> 01:07:02,720
Pull the van out back, so that I can
sneak out of here nice and quietly.

677
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:06,230
Oh, no. No, no, really, really.
You're too good to me. Really.

678
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:10,270
No. Thanks for putting me in the middle of this
cheap-shit country bumpkin outfit, Paul.

679
01:07:10,370 --> 01:07:11,480
我真的很感激
I really appreciate it!

680
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:13,480
我的粉丝们比这更期待
My fans expect better than this.

681
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:17,360
No, no. Look, you tell that penny-pinching whiner
Mike Sarducci that when I get back,

682
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:20,830
I am personally gonna cut off his
balls and wear 'em as earrings.

683
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:23,950
Where's the goddamn van?
God!

684
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:27,870
Oh, no, I'm trotting out for a cheeseburger.
I'm taking the show to the real Myers house,

685
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:30,000
where we should have
done it in the first place.

686
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:37,680
Ten minutes in that house and I'll have
every fruitcake medium in the country

687
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:41,470
calling in trying to channel the
spirit of that pussy Michael Myers.

688
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:45,270
当然  我们可以再看一场关于他的节目
Sure, we can do another show about him.

689
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:48,310
Kick the audience in the face enough
and they'll lick you all over.

690
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:52,070
我回来后给你打电话  保罗  再见
I'll call you when I get back, Paul. Bye-bye.

691
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,860
在那里F…
Where the f...

692
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:27,520
灯怎么了
What happened to the lights?

693
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:31,020
你真的认为巴里会出现吗
Do you really think Barry's gonna show up?

694
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:33,400
希望不会
Let's hope not.

695
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:36,400
I'm sorry he turned out
to be such an asshole.

696
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,740
没关系
It's okay.

697
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:41,200
大家都在哪儿
Where is everyone?

698
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:42,410
妈妈
Mom?

699
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:43,690
Kara
Kara?

700
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:45,330
他们可能在集市上
They're probably at the fair,

701
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:47,250
那是我们应该去的地方
which is where we should be.

702
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:48,450
贝丝……
Beth...

703
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:52,710
What you said before about
Michael Myers living in our house.

704
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:54,790
是真的吗
Is that really true?

705
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,880
那是个寒冷的万圣节夜晚
It was a cold Halloween night.

706
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:03,220
He stood in the shadows,
watching through the windows...

707
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,760
因为他姐姐和男朋友做爱了
as his sister and her boyfriend made love.

708
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,390
然后他爬进去…
Then he crept inside...

709
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,310
拿起一把巨大的屠刀…
picked up a huge butcher knife...

710
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:13,310
他爬上了这些楼梯
and made his way up these stairs.

711
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,310
他把刀举到她身后…
He raised the knife up behind her...

712
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:17,440
她转身…
She turned around...

713
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:18,860
他还刺伤了她
and he stabbed her!

714
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,570
别说了  贝丝
Cut it out, Beth!

715
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:27,120
I really didn't know that Michael
Myers lived in my house, okay?

716
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:28,950
它把我吓坏了
It freaks me out.

717
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:31,450
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

718
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:35,210
我只是在胡闹
I was just fooling around.

719
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:36,540
没关系
It's okay.

720
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:44,430
我们去拿蜡烛吧
Let's get the candles.

721
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:46,510
请稍等
Just a minute.

722
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,730
Mommy, it's raining.
It's raining red.

723
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:02,360
Mommy, it's raining.
It's raining red.

724
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:06,450
Mommy, it's raining.
It's raining red.

725
01:10:07,410 --> 01:10:09,240
妈妈  下雨了
Mommy, it's raining red.

726
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:13,540
Mommy, it's raining.
It's raining red.

727
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:17,210
Mommy, it's raining.
It's raining red.

728
01:10:17,790 --> 01:10:21,170
Mommy, it's raining.
It's raining red.

729
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,260
妈妈  下雨了
Mommy, it's raining red.

730
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:28,140
天气很暖和
It's warm.

731
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:30,770
为什么是温暖的
Why is it warm?

732
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,420
卢米斯医生
Dr. Loomis.

733
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:58,710
事情正在发生
It's happening.

734
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:08,640
Your sister would kill us if she
knew we did it in her bed.

735
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:11,140
嘿  那是你的主意
Hey, that was your idea.

736
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:13,930
我很坏  不是吗
I am bad, aren't I?

737
01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:18,730
Only when you wear crotchless
panties and bark like a dog.

738
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:27,110
你要去哪里
Where are you going?

739
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:28,660
我要洗个澡
I gotta take a shower.

740
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,490
你知道  保持新鲜
You know, to stay fresh.

741
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:40,840
小心那些乡巴佬
Watch out for the boogeyman.

742
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:10,240
Hey, Beth, can you bring a
towel in here? I'm freezing.

743
01:12:11,490 --> 01:12:13,030
当我需要你的时候你在哪里  亲爱的
Where are you when I need you, honey?

744
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,040
谢谢
Thanks.

745
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,340
我马上就到
I'll be in in a minute.

746
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:49,780
妈妈
Mommy?

747
01:12:52,490 --> 01:12:54,530
等一下  丹尼
Hold on a second, Danny.

748
01:12:56,950 --> 01:13:00,000
丹尼…来找我…
<i>Danny... Come to me...</i>

749
01:13:01,870 --> 01:13:04,000
- Hello?
- Mom? Wait, who is this?

750
01:13:04,210 --> 01:13:05,340
不  我是贝丝
No, this is Beth.

751
01:13:06,170 --> 01:13:07,380
你在那儿干什么
What are you doing there?

752
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:10,380
- Do you know where my mother is?
- She's not home. No one is.

753
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:11,580
发生了什么
What's wrong?

754
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,010
蒂姆和你在一起吗
Is Tim with you?

755
01:13:13,470 --> 01:13:14,720
他在洗澡
He's in the shower.

756
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:17,850
我在街对面
I'm across the street.

757
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:19,350
我能看见你
I can see you.

758
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,100
贝丝  我要你听我说
Beth, I want you to listen to me.

759
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:23,520
Get Tim and get out of that house.
Right now.

760
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:25,310
卡罗尔  到底怎么回事
Carol, what the hell is going on?

761
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,730
Beth, look out! There's someone in the room.
He's right behind you!

762
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:46,880
不
No!

763
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:52,880
不
No!

764
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:54,640
丹尼  不
Danny, no!

765
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:56,300
丹尼
Danny!

766
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:01,810
丹尼
Danny.

767
01:15:57,130 --> 01:15:58,130
丹尼
Danny?

768
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:09,640
丹尼
Danny?

769
01:16:10,850 --> 01:16:11,850
丹尼
Danny.

770
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:13,400
妈妈
Mommy?

771
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:14,940
没关系
It's okay.

772
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:18,110
丹尼  快跑
Danny, run!

773
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:05,760
丹尼
Danny.

774
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:07,720
来妈妈那儿
Come to mommy.

775
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:12,600
丹尼  拜托
Danny, please.

776
01:19:01,150 --> 01:19:02,060
孩子
The baby.

777
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,190
孩子在哪里
Where's the baby?

778
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,290
拜托
Please!

779
01:19:04,390 --> 01:19:05,740
打开门
Open the door!

780
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:07,090
拜托
Please!

781
01:19:07,190 --> 01:19:09,910
Open the door!
Someone help us!

782
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:14,460
拜托  有人帮帮我们
Please, somebody help us!

783
01:19:16,830 --> 01:19:18,210
请帮帮我们
Help us, please!

784
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,380
请帮帮我们
Help us, please!

785
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:28,470
把他们带上楼
Get 'em upstairs!

786
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:29,630
现在
Now!

787
01:19:29,730 --> 01:19:30,720
孩子在哪里
Where's the baby?

788
01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:32,100
他走了
He's gone.

789
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:34,560
还有谁知道我生了孩子
Who else knew I had the baby?

790
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,020
- No one.
- No!

791
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:38,060
必须有其他人…
There had to be someone else...

792
01:19:38,270 --> 01:19:41,900
- Who knew?
- Nobody knew except me and...

793
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:44,320
丹尼  来找我
<i>Danny. Come to me.</i>

794
01:19:49,870 --> 01:19:52,240
丹尼  来找我
<i>Danny. Come to me.</i>

795
01:19:56,370 --> 01:19:58,670
来吧  丹尼  来找我
<i>Come Danny, come to me.</i>

796
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:07,920
丹尼  不
Danny, no.

797
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:10,930
不
No.

798
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:12,140
拜托
Please.

799
01:20:16,430 --> 01:20:17,810
小心那个女孩
Careful with the girl.

800
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:20,560
卡拉
Kara!

801
01:20:21,770 --> 01:20:22,770
永利
Wynn.

802
01:20:29,070 --> 01:20:32,240
Mrs. Blankenship!
Oh, God, hurry! We have to...

803
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:35,870
你好  亲爱的
Hello, dear.

804
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:19,540
她在哪里
Where is she?

805
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:20,870
卡拉在哪里
Where's Kara?

806
01:21:22,830 --> 01:21:24,380
我觉得自己被下药了
I feel like I've been drugged.

807
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:25,960
我们被下药了
We have been drugged.

808
01:21:26,170 --> 01:21:27,380
他们为什么这么做
Why are they doing this?

809
01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:29,800
他们为什么不杀了我们
Why didn't they just kill us?

810
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:32,380
这是他的比赛
It's his game.

811
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:36,720
我知道他想去哪儿玩
And I know where he wants to play it.

812
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:07,880
- Dr. Loomis, you know that can't stop Michael.
- Nothing will stop Michael.

813
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:09,840
但是…
But...

814
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:11,260
永利
Wynn.

815
01:22:13,550 --> 01:22:15,340
I tried to tell you
in the hospital.

816
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:19,970
I think Michael is under the
influence of an evil rune.

817
01:22:20,850 --> 01:22:22,050
刺
Thorn.

818
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:29,150
I saw the symbol marked up
where we found Jamie stabbed.

819
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:32,030
好吧  这里有光明的符文…保护
Well, there are runes of light... Protection.

820
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:37,160
If Thorn could somehow be trapped by these
runes the energies could cancel themselves out.

821
01:22:37,370 --> 01:22:39,080
邪恶可以被消灭
The evil could be destroyed.

822
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:42,660
你在这儿等着
You wait here.

823
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:45,000
我回来之前不要去任何地方
Don't go anywhere until I come back.

824
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:47,420
永利
Wynn.

825
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:59,680
时间到了  卢米斯医生
About time, Dr. Loomis.

826
01:23:00,970 --> 01:23:02,890
欢迎来到你的命运
Welcome to your fate.

827
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:05,810
The time has come for
you to know the truth.

828
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:10,440
The time has come
for you to join us.

829
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:13,540
为什么是现在
Why now?

830
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,760
After Jamie escaped last night,
I knew that she would come to you,

831
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:20,830
and I knew that you would
lead us to her baby.

832
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:24,160
她非常特别的孩子
Her very special baby.

833
01:23:24,910 --> 01:23:29,330
我需要她  就像我现在需要你一样
I needed her, just as I need you now.

834
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:34,380
It's your destiny, Sam.
It lives inside you.

835
01:23:34,590 --> 01:23:37,340
It always has.
You know that, don't you?

836
01:23:37,630 --> 01:23:38,630
你…
You...

837
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:41,760
是
are...

838
01:23:43,270 --> 01:23:44,270
疯子
a madman.

839
01:24:33,070 --> 01:24:34,820
看看你周围  山姆
<i>Look around you, Sam.</i>

840
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:38,070
疯狂无处不在
Madness everywhere.

841
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:42,370
饥荒  战争  一场大瘟疫
Famine, war, a great plague.

842
01:24:42,570 --> 01:24:48,910
These are signs that we must restore
balance to the natural order of things.

843
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,420
- We merely provide the means.
- Michael?

844
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:58,550
We've given him the power.
The gift of Thorn.

845
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:04,260
I am its deliverer. I follow it,
act as its guardian.

846
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:07,890
我保护迈克尔  看着他
I protect Michael, watch over him.

847
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:13,020
现在是另一个人的时候了
And now it's time for another.

848
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:16,150
现在你该……
Now it's time for you....

849
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:18,150
卢米斯医生
Dr. Loomis.

850
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:23,530
我以为迈克尔是个怪物
I thought Michael was a monster.

851
01:25:24,370 --> 01:25:25,370
但是你……
But you...

852
01:25:37,710 --> 01:25:38,960
把他留在那里
Leave him there.

853
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,630
现在是他的办公室
It's his office now.

854
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:12,960
火焰的精神和力量
Spirits and powers of the flame.

855
01:26:15,130 --> 01:26:18,040
参加并见证这一仪式
Attend and witness this ritual.

856
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,920
把我们的礼物送给索恩
Bear our gifts to Thorn.

857
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,310
打开我们的黑暗之路
Open us to the path of darkness.

858
01:26:32,390 --> 01:26:35,400
通过这些符文改变我们
By these runes transform us.

859
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:42,610
Let the hammer descend on the chosen
one to whom we offer this sacrifice

860
01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:44,610
是无辜的
of innocent blood.

861
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:54,960
And then, Danny,
your journey begins.

862
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:57,500
为他杀人
Kill for him.

863
01:26:59,090 --> 01:27:00,090
不
No.

864
01:27:01,630 --> 01:27:05,510
迈克尔  你最后的牺牲
Michael, your final sacrifice.

865
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:10,560
迈克尔  你可以让他停下来
Michael, you can make him stop it.

866
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:15,520
Don't kill the baby.
You can stop it.

867
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,900
你知道是谁的孩子吧
You know whose baby it is, don't you?

868

退后
Back off!

871
01:27:31,530 --> 01:27:34,960
- Untie her.

872
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:38,920
你应该加入我们  你有天赋

Go!

878
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:06,190

Go, go!

879
01:28:28,430 --> 01:28:30,220
移动它  走  走
Move it! Go, go!

880
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:36,100
倒霉
Shit!

881
01:28:37,310 --> 01:28:40,900
- Come on!
- It's not working.

882
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:43,230
来吧  它不起作用
Come on. It's not working!

883
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:45,730
不是…
It's not...

884
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:03,540
退后
Back up from the gates!

885
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:10,550
把他们弄出去
Get 'em out of here!

886
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:16,510
Get in there!
Go on, get in!

887
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:20,550
妈妈
Mommy!

888
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:36,840
萨哈因
Samhain.

889
01:29:58,970 --> 01:30:00,850
汤米  他在哪里
Tommy! Where is he?

890
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:03,940
It worked.
The power of the runes stopped him.

891
01:30:07,190 --> 01:30:08,480
迈克尔
Michael.

892
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:12,990
他们对你做了什么
What have they done to you?

893
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,840
- Where do we go now?
- As far away from Haddonfield as possible.

894
01:30:33,430 --> 01:30:39,220
- Come with us.
- No, I have a little business to attend to here.

895
01:31:12,010 --> 01:31:13,340
迈克尔
Michael.

896

迈克尔
Michael.

897

It's all over.

一切都结束了
It's all over!

899
01:31:30,190 --> 01:31:32,320
现在一切都结束了
It's all over now.

900
01:31:40,910 --> 01:31:41,950
迈克尔
Michael.

901
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:44,540
迈克尔走了
