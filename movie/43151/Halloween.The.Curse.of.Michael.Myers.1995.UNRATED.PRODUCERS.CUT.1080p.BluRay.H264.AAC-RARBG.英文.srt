1
00:01:47,618 --> 00:01:48,736
Push!

2
00:01:51,622 --> 00:01:54,708
Oh, God, it's coming! It's coming!

3
00:02:00,756 --> 00:02:02,549
Oh, God, it's coming!

4
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:13,894
No!

5
00:02:23,445 --> 00:02:25,620
Please. Please, give him to me.

6
00:02:53,805 --> 00:02:55,185
No, please.

7
00:02:59,815 --> 00:03:03,402
No. Please, my baby. Please, give him to me.

8
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:08,573
Damn you!

9
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:18,272
<i>When Michael Myers was six years old,</i>

10
00:03:18,808 --> 00:03:22,452
<i>he stabbed his sister to death.</i>

11
00:03:25,757 --> 00:03:32,778
<i>For years he was locked up, locked away in Smith's Grove Sanitarium.</i>

12
00:03:35,017 --> 00:03:36,952
<i>But he escaped.</i>

13
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,832
<i>And suddenly...</i>

14
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:43,004
<i>Halloween was another word for mayhem.</i>

15
00:03:45,444 --> 00:03:49,906
<i>He needed to wipe out his entire family.</i>

16
00:03:51,992 --> 00:03:56,359
<i>He struck them down at night, and always on Halloween.</i>

17
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,391
<i>The police tried everything to stop him.</i>

18
00:04:04,838 --> 00:04:07,696
<i>He overcame them all...</i>

19
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:13,151
<i>and disappeared.</i>

20
00:04:15,474 --> 00:04:17,932
<i>The world thought him dead,</i>

21
00:04:18,226 --> 00:04:19,926
<i>But I...</i>

22
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,217
<i>I wasn't sure.</i>

23
00:04:23,065 --> 00:04:28,214
<i>I wasn't sure that Michael Myers had died.</i>

24
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:45,879
<i>Jamie, come to me.</i>

25
00:04:50,008 --> 00:04:52,761
<i>Jamie, come to me.</i>

26
00:05:15,742 --> 00:05:16,910
Jamie...

27
00:05:17,536 --> 00:05:19,549
Come with me if you want to save your baby.

28
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:25,856
- Oh, God... He's coming. - We've got to move, now.

29
00:05:26,503 --> 00:05:27,691
Come on.

30
00:05:42,686 --> 00:05:44,437
No! Oh, God.

31
00:05:44,604 --> 00:05:45,810
Come on.

32
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:55,782
It's okay!

33
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:01,976
You can do it. You can do it.

34
00:06:10,964 --> 00:06:13,103
There! It's that way!

35
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,202
- Come on. - No.

36
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:19,639
Save your baby! Go now!

37
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,832
Jamie?

38
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,255
Jamie?

39
00:08:26,116 --> 00:08:28,272
Hey! What are you doing in my truck?

40
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:29,304
Run!

41
00:08:29,436 --> 00:08:31,479
What the hell're you doing in my truck?

42
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,528
- What? - Run!

43
00:08:35,942 --> 00:08:37,295
What?

44
00:09:18,026 --> 00:09:21,112
<i>Danny. Danny.</i>

45
00:09:21,946 --> 00:09:24,574
- <i>Kill for him.</i> - Mommy!

46
00:09:26,451 --> 00:09:27,584
Danny?

47
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:32,976
Mommy's here.

48
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,935
What is it, baby?

49
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,102
The Voiceman. He's here.

50
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:42,258
- No one's there, sweetheart. - But I've seen him.

51
00:09:42,638 --> 00:09:45,015
You've been watching way too much TV, you know that?

52
00:09:45,053 --> 00:09:47,241
He says things. Bad things.

53
00:09:47,651 --> 00:09:49,038
Like what?

54
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,863
Okay.

55
00:09:54,521 --> 00:09:57,882
Stay away monsters, stay away ghouls.

56
00:09:57,941 --> 00:10:01,713
Stay away from Danny, you jerks know the rules.

57
00:10:04,656 --> 00:10:07,695
Better? Here.

58
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:26,908
Good night, Danny.

59
00:10:26,928 --> 00:10:28,167
Good night, mom.

60
00:10:36,104 --> 00:10:39,596
<i>It's "Back Talk" with Barry Simms.</i>

61
00:10:39,607 --> 00:10:40,752
<i>Jesus, who is that guy?</i>

62
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:45,511
<i>We're in the second hour of a special Halloween edition of "Back Talk". I'm Barry Simms.</i>

63
00:10:45,566 --> 00:10:47,694
<i>As usual, we're coming to you live from</i>

64
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,628
<i>high atop the Sears Tower here in Chicago.</i>

65
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:53,604
<i>Tomorrow night, we will be coming to you from Haddonfield,</i>

66
00:10:53,663 --> 00:10:57,670
<i>the town that has banned Halloween since 1989,</i>

67
00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:00,232
<i>when infamous serial killer Michael Myers,</i>

68
00:11:00,295 --> 00:11:05,062
<i>his niece, Jamie Lloyd, and about a dozen cops were killed in an explosion.</i>

69
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,290
<i>We have a caller waiting.</i>

70
00:11:06,342 --> 00:11:08,052
<i>Who's next to talk to me?</i>

71
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,544
<i>I... I know this may sound crazy, Barry, but...</i>

72
00:11:11,598 --> 00:11:13,828
<i>I really think I'm in love with him.</i>

73
00:11:13,864 --> 00:11:17,533
<i>He's so untamed, so uninhibited.</i>

74
00:11:17,572 --> 00:11:20,274
<i>He's everything I've ever wanted in a man.</i>

75
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:23,563
<i>- You know, this is good. - I can see the tabloids now.</i>

76
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:27,532
<i>The Best Sex He Ever Dismembers"</i>

77
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:31,091
<i>Is this the type that you always fall for, lady? Any other serial studs on the list?</i>

78
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:32,426
<i>You know, Bundy, Manson?</i>

79
00:11:32,452 --> 00:11:35,236
<i>What about that Dahmer guy? I bet...</i>

80
00:11:35,268 --> 00:11:39,457
<i>- I bet you could really cook with him.</i> <i>- No, I just want Michael.</i>

81
00:11:39,486 --> 00:11:42,009
<i>I... I wanna know what's behind that mask.</i>

82
00:11:42,045 --> 00:11:45,260
<i>Deep down, I think he's just like you and me, Barry.</i>

83
00:11:45,381 --> 00:11:47,972
He just needs someone to understand him.

84
00:11:48,003 --> 00:11:51,339
<i>- Someone to love him.</i> <i>- Yeah, deep down I'm sure that's true.</i>

85
00:11:51,393 --> 00:11:55,618
<i>You're talking about one of this nation's most notorious serial killers</i>

86
00:11:55,642 --> 00:11:57,996
<i>like he belongs in some kind of ESS Seminar.</i>

87
00:11:58,007 --> 00:12:00,042
<i>You know, I hate to be the one to break the news to you, lady,</i>

88
00:12:00,074 --> 00:12:03,287
<i>but Michael Myers has been dead for six years.</i>

89
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:19,741
<i>Now...</i>

90
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:23,767
<i>we've got someone who actually claims to have seen that Michael Myers.</i>

91
00:12:24,587 --> 00:12:27,587
- <i>Does this wacko caller have a name?</i> - My name's Tommy.

92
00:12:28,341 --> 00:12:30,868
I was only eight years old, when I saw him.

93
00:12:31,094 --> 00:12:33,014
But I was one of the lucky ones.

94
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:35,275
I survived.

95
00:12:36,153 --> 00:12:39,017
<i>There is help out there for people like you.</i>

96
00:12:39,811 --> 00:12:41,449
<i>It's called electro-shock therapy!</i>

97
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,943
<i>Come on. You don't really believe that Michael Myers is actually alive.</i>

98
00:12:44,983 --> 00:12:48,079
Michael's work isn't done in Haddonfield.

99
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:49,487
And soon...

100
00:12:49,821 --> 00:12:51,072
Very soon...

101
00:12:51,739 --> 00:12:53,058
He'll come home...

102
00:12:53,324 --> 00:12:54,731
to kill again.

103
00:12:55,743 --> 00:12:57,041
But this time I'll be ready.

104
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,872
<i>Actually, Tom, I hear Smith's Grove is having a blue light on Vicodin; check that out.</i>

105
00:13:01,908 --> 00:13:03,970
<i>The lines are open, so give me your best shot</i>

106
00:13:04,002 --> 00:13:07,213
<i>at 1-800-968-7825.</i>

107
00:13:07,236 --> 00:13:09,940
<i>Next up is uh, Dwayne.</i>

108
00:13:09,966 --> 00:13:12,960
<i>What's on your feeble excuse for a mind tonight, Dwayne?</i>

109
00:13:13,052 --> 00:13:16,588
<i>I'd just like to say that I listen to your show every night, Barry.</i>

110
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,978
<i>I think you're the best. I can't tell you how excited we are</i>

111
00:13:20,018 --> 00:13:23,313
<i>that you'll be paying a little visit to our little town tomorrow night.</i>

112
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,215
<i>So do you have a point to make here, Dwayne,</i>

113
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,899
<i>or should I just keep spanking the monkey?</i>

114
00:13:26,965 --> 00:13:29,611
<i>Barry, you're too much.</i>

115
00:13:29,819 --> 00:13:32,272
<i>I'd just like to say that I understand how things</i>

116
00:13:32,326 --> 00:13:33,823
<i>have changed in the 90's.</i>

117
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:35,412
<i>Gays in the military,</i>

118
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,520
<i>cut off your husband's do-jigger and become a national hero.</i>

119
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,340
<i>I just can't see any sense in bringing Halloween back to Haddonfield.</i>

120
00:13:41,372 --> 00:13:43,174
<i>Wink, wink. Thank you, Dwayne.</i>

121
00:13:43,185 --> 00:13:45,355
<i>You may leave me now.</i>

122
00:13:46,044 --> 00:13:47,582
<i>Next caller.</i>

123
00:13:47,606 --> 00:13:51,007
<i>I say it's about time they had a Halloween revival in this town.</i>

124
00:13:51,215 --> 00:13:53,978
<i>Now my kids can stop driving me crazy.</i>

125
00:13:54,093 --> 00:13:57,096
<i>That maniac's either long dead or long gone.</i>

126
00:13:57,107 --> 00:14:00,808
<i>Either way, I say let's bury this sucker and get the party started.</i>

127
00:14:01,017 --> 00:14:03,478
<i>- Party, woo-hoo! - Beer! Yeah!</i>

128
00:14:03,686 --> 00:14:04,801
<i>Thank you... next.</i>

129
00:14:04,812 --> 00:14:08,092
<i>Barry, what happened to that psychiatrist of his, Loomis?</i>

130
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:10,031
<i>I heard the old quack was dead.</i>

131
00:14:10,109 --> 00:14:13,257
Not dead.

132
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,940
Just very much retired.

133
00:14:23,873 --> 00:14:28,961
- Good God. Terence. Come in. - Christ, what a night.

134
00:14:29,212 --> 00:14:33,234
Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!

135
00:14:33,265 --> 00:14:35,533
That's the beauty of the countryside.

136
00:14:36,164 --> 00:14:37,563
I thrive on it.

137
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,942
- God, you look good, Sam. - I feel great.

138
00:14:40,969 --> 00:14:44,018
I had surgery, plastic surgery.

139
00:14:44,227 --> 00:14:49,941
Skin grafts. It cost a fortune, but at least I don't frighten people anymore.

140
00:14:50,021 --> 00:14:53,186
Don't tell me the revered Rasputin of Smith's Grove

141
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,061
has grown complacent in his old age.

142
00:14:56,084 --> 00:14:57,841
Well, I won't believe that for a second.

143
00:14:57,865 --> 00:15:02,495
Well, I can't remember you making house calls, Dr. Wynn,

144
00:15:02,704 --> 00:15:04,798
especially at this hour.

145
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:08,246
And you're right. I've come to celebrate?

146
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:12,380
Why are you listening to that jerk?

147
00:15:12,588 --> 00:15:16,837
Oh, it's a program about Haddonfield.

148
00:15:16,884 --> 00:15:18,398
I'm taping it.

149
00:15:37,405 --> 00:15:42,097
<i>So, who is responsible for getting this Halloween rally thing together?</i>

150
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,089
<i>We are, the students of Haddonfield junior college.</i>

151
00:15:45,163 --> 00:15:48,249
<i>But why go to all the trouble of throwing this soiree?</i>

152
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,708
<i>So what if Halloween has been banned in Haddonfield?</i>

153
00:15:50,747 --> 00:15:51,846
<i>Who gives a damn?</i>

154
00:15:51,878 --> 00:15:55,581
<i>- We do! We live here. - I mean, it's time we got on with our lives.</i>

155
00:15:55,628 --> 00:15:57,799
<i>That's what tomorrow night is all about.</i>

156
00:15:57,884 --> 00:16:00,926
<i>- This town is dying, Barry.</i> <i>- Wow.</i>

157
00:16:01,012 --> 00:16:05,224
<i>You know, I've heard Michael Myers blamed for a lot of things tonight, but this is a first.</i>

158
00:16:05,254 --> 00:16:06,821
<i>He's actually killed the economy!</i>

159
00:16:07,018 --> 00:16:09,515
<i>Look, tomorrow night is going to change all that,</i>

160
00:16:09,562 --> 00:16:12,231
<i>especially after you do your broadcast live from campus...</i>

161
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,783
<i>You have reached Haddonfield Emergency Services.</i>

162
00:16:15,902 --> 00:16:19,611
<i>Due to severe weather conditions, all circuits are momentarily busy.</i>

163
00:16:19,655 --> 00:16:21,502
<i>If this is not an emergency...</i>

164
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:24,083
<i>You gonna get up there on the stage with old Bar'?</i>

165
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,083
<i>- Uh, yeah, I will.</i> <i>- Yeah?</i>

166
00:16:26,162 --> 00:16:29,443
<i>- Well, I'll see you tomorrow night. - This is "Back Talk" with Barry Simms.</i>

167
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:36,839
<i>Give me a call at 1-800-968-7825. That's 1-800-YOU-SUCK.</i>

168
00:16:37,048 --> 00:16:40,168
<i>So come on, all you boogeyman believers out there.</i>

169
00:16:40,218 --> 00:16:41,862
<i>Give me a call.</i>

170
00:16:41,886 --> 00:16:43,239
<i>Call me tonight.</i>

171
00:16:46,557 --> 00:16:49,187
Well, after 32 years,

172
00:16:49,227 --> 00:16:51,591
guess who is finally relinquishing his duties

173
00:16:51,646 --> 00:16:54,143
as chief administrator of Smith's Grove?

174
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:58,344
- Good god, you don't mean to say you're-- - Retiring!

175
00:16:58,402 --> 00:17:00,571
I came by to give you the news myself.

176
00:17:00,675 --> 00:17:04,569
Well, I wish you well, Terence.

177
00:17:04,617 --> 00:17:07,227
It's been in the planning stages for some time now.

178
00:17:09,205 --> 00:17:10,776
To old friends...

179
00:17:11,332 --> 00:17:12,676
To retirement...

180
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:14,672
To new beginnings.

181
00:17:14,757 --> 00:17:16,172
Old friends.

182
00:17:22,593 --> 00:17:23,768
Sam...

183
00:17:23,803 --> 00:17:26,347
I want you to come back to Smith's Grove.

184
00:17:28,391 --> 00:17:33,831
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.

185
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:38,648
It's no prank. You are the one I've chosen, Sam. I want you to come back.

186
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:43,249
After my stroke six years ago they practically had to hold a pistol

187
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:46,650
to my head to get me to retire, but...

188
00:17:47,202 --> 00:17:50,496
Things are different now. I'm different.

189
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:56,134
I've buried the ghosts. I've buried them in this manuscript.

190
00:17:56,627 --> 00:17:59,562
I don't want to practice medicine anymore.

191
00:17:59,714 --> 00:18:03,018
<i>- They're coming! They're coming! - Dr. Loomis are you out there?</i>

192
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:05,602
<i>- They're Comng, they're coming. - Don't tell me, your name is Joan...</i>

193
00:18:05,674 --> 00:18:08,337
<i>Joan of Arc, and you're also hearing voices, right?</i>

194
00:18:09,807 --> 00:18:11,512
<i>Now, who's coming?</i>

195
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:14,099
<i>It's Michael.</i>

196
00:18:14,162 --> 00:18:15,747
<i>Michael Myers.</i>

197
00:18:17,106 --> 00:18:18,707
<i>Look, someone, anyone...</i>

198
00:18:18,746 --> 00:18:20,724
<i>Help me. Dr. Loomis, are you out there?</i>

199
00:18:20,777 --> 00:18:22,947
<i>Can you hear me? Dr. Loomis, I need your help.</i>

200
00:18:22,972 --> 00:18:24,925
<i>Please, please. No, no, stop. Stop that.</i>

201
00:18:24,949 --> 00:18:26,672
<i>What the hell is going on tonight?</i>

202
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:30,368
<i>Every looney in the state is calling. What is this? A full moon?</i>

203
00:18:31,203 --> 00:18:34,582
<i>Oh, man. I guess Halloween brings out all the wackos.</i>

204
00:18:35,124 --> 00:18:37,631
<i>I can't wait until we get to Haddonfield tomorrow.</i>

205
00:18:37,671 --> 00:18:40,743
<i>I'm gonna rip the lid off of this fire for you.</i>

206
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:43,503
<i>Now I'm back, listeners.</i>

207
00:18:43,552 --> 00:18:44,945
<i>Now I'm back.</i>

208
00:19:02,068 --> 00:19:05,446
Shhh. Shhhh.

209
00:19:07,444 --> 00:19:08,820
It's okay.

210
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:13,287
Yes. it's alright.

211
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,876
Shhh. Yes.

212
00:19:20,711 --> 00:19:22,023
It's okay.

213
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,927
You're so beautiful.

214
00:19:27,406 --> 00:19:28,516
Yes.

215
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:57,323
No!

216
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,147
Leave us alone!

217
00:22:58,512 --> 00:23:00,347
You can't have the baby, Michael.

218
00:23:01,307 --> 00:23:03,058
You can't have the baby.

219
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,473
Enough...

220
00:23:35,341 --> 00:23:37,264
of this Michael Myers...

221
00:23:38,177 --> 00:23:39,590
bullshit!

222
00:23:40,888 --> 00:23:45,093
Now, you stinking kids got about three seconds to get the hell off my property!

223
00:23:45,142 --> 00:23:47,407
One! Two!

224
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:30,829
It was Jamie Lloyd.

225
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,360
That was six years ago, Sam.

226
00:24:33,383 --> 00:24:35,367
You know she died with him in that explosion.

227
00:24:35,401 --> 00:24:38,249
- You know it! - That's what someone would like us to believe.

228
00:24:38,821 --> 00:24:42,566
But I tell you Michael is alive. I...

229
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:47,775
I can feel his evil heart beating.

230
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,573
I can see him just as I did all those years ago

231
00:24:51,637 --> 00:24:54,599
behind these very same walls.

232
00:24:54,753 --> 00:24:58,997
Staring, staring.

233
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:02,054
Always growing stronger.

234
00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:07,090
Please. As my colleague...

235
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,913
as my friend...

236
00:25:09,352 --> 00:25:12,548
I can't go through this again.

237
00:25:12,604 --> 00:25:14,219
Not alone.

238
00:25:14,606 --> 00:25:17,523
I need your help to stop him.

239
00:25:24,325 --> 00:25:27,202
Dr. Wynn, I didn't expect you in this morning.

240
00:25:28,162 --> 00:25:32,726
Donna, this is Dr. Loomis, the man I was telling you about.

241
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:35,336
Oh, yes. It's a pleasure to meet you, doctor.

242
00:25:35,477 --> 00:25:37,713
It will be wonderful to have you back at the hospital.

243
00:25:38,589 --> 00:25:40,796
Dr. Wynn, there's something you should know.

244
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:43,303
Donna, I'd like you to get Dr. Loomis anything he needs.

245
00:25:43,344 --> 00:25:46,883
Files, tests, records of every treatment we've ever administered

246
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:50,059
to a former patient of ours, Michael Myers.

247
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,392
- Michael Myers? - Is something wrong?

248
00:25:54,438 --> 00:25:57,399
I just received a phone call. That girl Jamie Lloyd...

249
00:25:57,608 --> 00:26:00,056
Her body was found this morning near Haddonfield.

250
00:26:03,197 --> 00:26:05,553
Notify the Haddonfield sheriff; tell him we're on the way.

251
00:26:05,657 --> 00:26:07,284
I want the entire staff on alert.

252
00:26:07,321 --> 00:26:10,216
We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.

253
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:13,165
If that maniac is really out there...

254
00:26:13,374 --> 00:26:15,167
I plan to bring him back.

255
00:26:15,376 --> 00:26:16,754
Alive.

256
00:26:17,252 --> 00:26:19,046
Yo, G, wassup?!

257
00:26:20,214 --> 00:26:22,424
Barry's my homeboy from Chicago.

258
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:25,130
Yes, that Barry Simms.

259
00:26:25,511 --> 00:26:27,304
Beth and I are down on this gig.

260
00:26:27,513 --> 00:26:29,306
Danny.

261
00:26:29,515 --> 00:26:33,102
Look, you just bring the posse tonight, and we'll hook you up.

262
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,104
Ace.

263
00:26:39,608 --> 00:26:42,986
Doesn't Danny look cute dressed up as his Uncle Tim?

264
00:26:43,818 --> 00:26:47,366
Great. Now I've got a six-year-old gang member for a son.

265
00:26:47,521 --> 00:26:48,614
Perfect.

266
00:26:49,452 --> 00:26:52,037
This is the famous Tim Strode stomach pounder.

267
00:26:52,246 --> 00:26:54,706
- You down for the challenge? - Hit me, G.

268
00:26:59,837 --> 00:27:01,301
Good try, Dan man.

269
00:27:01,387 --> 00:27:03,247
You better stick to orange juice.

270
00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:04,991
Shitheads.

271
00:27:05,175 --> 00:27:06,931
Defacing my property.

272
00:27:09,012 --> 00:27:11,345
- I showed them. - John, they were just kids.

273
00:27:11,408 --> 00:27:14,069
Kids, my dear Deborah, are what's ruining this country.

274
00:27:14,111 --> 00:27:17,719
Everywhere you go it's the same damn thing. There's no goddamn respect.

275
00:27:19,815 --> 00:27:21,393
I rest my case.

276
00:27:24,111 --> 00:27:27,572
Kara, you'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach.

277
00:27:29,116 --> 00:27:33,979
"Cognitive therapy and emotional disorders". What are they teaching you in college these clays?

278
00:27:34,034 --> 00:27:35,440
The art of going crazy?

279
00:27:35,503 --> 00:27:37,131
It's called psychology, mom.

280
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:40,056
Living in this house is enough to drive anyone crazy.

281
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,289
Oh, yeah?

282
00:27:41,414 --> 00:27:44,192
Well, who the hell asked you to come back here in the first place?

283
00:27:47,092 --> 00:27:48,881
I better get Danny to school.

284
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,479
Doesn't show her face around her own family for five years...

285
00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:54,221
then comes back and expects us to roll out the red carpet.

286
00:27:54,268 --> 00:27:57,064
You think going to college is gonna make up for your mistakes, girl?

287
00:27:57,088 --> 00:27:59,578
- John, please. - Lay off her, dad.

288
00:28:00,868 --> 00:28:01,994
Let's go, Danny.

289
00:28:02,024 --> 00:28:06,620
Kara, wait, please. John, can't we just sit down for once and try to be a family?

290
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:07,839
Sorry, Mom.

291
00:28:09,907 --> 00:28:13,100
Oh, yeah, that's it, Deborah. Just keep slipping her the cash.

292
00:28:13,209 --> 00:28:15,583
You know, while you're at it, I got a great idea. Here.

293
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:17,810
Why don't you give her all of our goddamn money?

294
00:28:17,849 --> 00:28:19,692
Why don't you leave her alone?

295
00:28:20,341 --> 00:28:21,801
Nothing ever changes, does it?

296
00:28:21,969 --> 00:28:23,387
You've gotta wake up.

297
00:28:23,597 --> 00:28:25,057
I got news for you, girl.

298
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,220
Before you came around, everything was going fine.

299
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:29,918
Until you landed on our doorstep.

300
00:28:30,697 --> 00:28:32,126
You and that little...

301
00:28:32,858 --> 00:28:34,401
bastard of yours.

302
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:42,904
I see only one bastard in this house.

303
00:28:46,068 --> 00:28:47,731
<i>Danny...</i>

304
00:28:51,323 --> 00:28:52,632
Get away from her!

305
00:28:52,743 --> 00:28:54,335
You shut up and stay outta this!

306
00:28:54,368 --> 00:28:56,677
<i>- Kill for him.</i> - John, please, don't!

307
00:28:57,524 --> 00:29:01,388
You ever talk to me like that again and so help me God...

308
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:03,300
You understand?

309
00:29:26,191 --> 00:29:28,069
Give me the knife, Danny.

310
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:36,951
Hey...

311
00:29:37,327 --> 00:29:41,504
Hey. Make way for the Hardin County Express. Where's Tim?

312
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,038
We're supposed to go over the list of events for tonight.

313
00:29:44,376 --> 00:29:48,007
Oh, God. Did he do that to you?

314
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,842
Another episode of "Father Knows Best" at the Strode house.

315
00:29:52,092 --> 00:29:54,261
What the hell happened this time?

316
00:29:56,388 --> 00:29:59,149
- What's gotten into you? - Just glad to see you, that's all.

317
00:29:59,224 --> 00:30:00,407
You guys okay?

318
00:30:01,018 --> 00:30:04,610
Tonight's the night we bring some life back into this town.

319
00:30:04,694 --> 00:30:07,718
Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organize this friggin' fair?

320
00:30:07,757 --> 00:30:09,621
I mean, it's only Halloween.

321
00:30:09,901 --> 00:30:12,341
How many times do I have to tell you. It's not about Halloween.

322
00:30:12,404 --> 00:30:15,958
Now, Danny, you know Grandpa didn't really hurt me, right?

323
00:30:15,998 --> 00:30:17,171
Right, Mom.

324
00:30:18,311 --> 00:30:19,494
Well...

325
00:30:20,671 --> 00:30:22,294
you'd better go catch your bus.

326
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,031
But tonight when you come home we'll go trick-or-treating, okay?

327
00:30:25,042 --> 00:30:26,460
Okay.

328
00:30:27,836 --> 00:30:30,464
- I love you, Danny. - I love you, Mommy.

329
00:30:30,672 --> 00:30:32,257
Give me a squeeze.

330
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:43,198
Yeah. Okay.

331
00:30:45,937 --> 00:30:48,565
I just can't live with her anymore, Deborah.

332
00:30:49,274 --> 00:30:51,526
You don't understand, do you?

333
00:30:53,189 --> 00:30:55,817
It's not about Kara, it's about you.

334
00:30:57,866 --> 00:31:00,535
I don't care what she's done; she's your daughter.

335
00:31:02,496 --> 00:31:04,831
She's not my daughter anymore.

336
00:31:05,707 --> 00:31:08,490
Beth, who's that guy who lives across the hall from you?

337
00:31:08,565 --> 00:31:10,234
Why, you interested?

338
00:31:10,337 --> 00:31:11,660
Yeah, right.

339
00:31:11,713 --> 00:31:13,850
He's always staring out his window.

340
00:31:13,882 --> 00:31:15,756
Last night, I caught him watching me.

341
00:31:15,812 --> 00:31:17,207
That must be Tommy.

342
00:31:17,296 --> 00:31:19,079
On a weirdness scale of one to ten,

343
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,009
he rates about a 13.

344
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:24,714
Supposedly some scary shit happened to him, when he was a kid.

345
00:31:24,722 --> 00:31:26,559
Messed up his head pretty bad.

346
00:31:26,566 --> 00:31:27,862
He's harmless, though.

347
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,037
- He's probably just lonely. - Or horny.

348
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,230
Something you probably haven't felt in a while.

349
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:33,581
Tim...

350
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:36,990
Happy Halloween, Mrs. Blankenship!

351
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:41,602
Best part about living in that boarding house is that crazy old lady wouldn't hear a truck

352
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,077
drive through her living room.

353
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:46,238
<i>- Please. Look, you've gotta listen to me! - They're coming! They're coming!</i>

354
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:50,033
<i>- Yeah, so they're coming, they're coming. - Don't tell me. Your name is Joan...</i>

355
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:52,828
<i>Joan of Arc and you're also hearing voices, right?</i>

356
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,175
<i>Come on. Now, who's coming?</i>

357
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,584
<i>It's Michael.</i>

358
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,266
<i>Michael Myers.</i>

359
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:03,672
<i>Look, someone, anyone, help me.</i>

360
00:32:03,748 --> 00:32:06,718
<i>Dr. Loomis, are you out there? Can you hear me, Dr. L--</i>

361
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:14,142
<i>- It's Michael. - Michael Myers.</i>

362
00:32:14,173 --> 00:32:17,306
<i>- ...your attention, please. - Bus 611 from Pontiac...</i>

363
00:32:17,337 --> 00:32:19,649
<i>- Look, someone, anyone, help me. - Dr. Loomis, are you out there?</i>

364
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,328
<i>...has been delayed for an hour...</i>

365
00:32:21,367 --> 00:32:23,648
<i>I need your help. God, please, help.</i>

366
00:32:23,699 --> 00:32:25,441
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

367
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:29,406
<i>Bus 34 from Peoria, Russelville and Gardner...</i>

368
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:32,052
<i>with through service to Chicago, Illinois...</i>

369
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,453
<i>will be arriving in five minutes.</i>

370
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:39,583
<i>Ticketed passengers, please wait inside the door until arrival of bus number 34.</i>

371
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,407
Can I help you, sir?

372
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,661
Can you tell me if a bus arrived from Pontiac last night?

373
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:57,720
Sure did.

374
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:01,393
- Are you looking for someone? - Thank you.

375
00:33:36,199 --> 00:33:38,141
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

376
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:40,852
<i>Bus number 34, service to Chicago,</i>

377
00:33:40,912 --> 00:33:44,523
<i>has arrived and is now ready for boarding through the side doors.</i>

378
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:20,069
Jesus.

379
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:29,693
Shhh. Shhh.

380
00:34:32,087 --> 00:34:33,890
No. It's okay.

381
00:34:33,945 --> 00:34:37,529
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, man.

382
00:34:38,155 --> 00:34:40,574
It's okay. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

383
00:34:44,214 --> 00:34:45,351
Shhh.

384
00:34:53,642 --> 00:34:55,894
Good God, what's that?

385
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,152
It's... his mark.

386
00:34:59,353 --> 00:35:00,915
He's come home.

387
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,418
Dear God.

388
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:13,826
Jamie.

389
00:35:14,035 --> 00:35:16,245
Only God can help her now, sir.

390
00:35:16,454 --> 00:35:19,290
Sam, don't. Let them take care of her.

391
00:35:19,457 --> 00:35:21,626
- Doctor Loomis. - Yeah.

392
00:35:21,793 --> 00:35:23,586
They told me you'd be coming.

393
00:35:23,795 --> 00:35:27,340
Now I suggest you go right on back to your crackpot asylum.

394
00:35:28,007 --> 00:35:30,134
You people got no business in my town.

395
00:35:30,676 --> 00:35:33,596
Michael Myers is my business.

396
00:35:33,721 --> 00:35:37,141
It's been quiet here for six years and that's the way it's gonna stay,

397
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:40,936
and the last thing I need now is you going around spouting off ghost stories.

398
00:35:41,145 --> 00:35:43,355
I suppose it was a ghost that did all this, then.

399
00:35:43,564 --> 00:35:46,191
It was a ghost talking on the radio last night.

400
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,653
That's a ghost being carried out of here right now?!

401
00:36:16,263 --> 00:36:17,847
Yo, check it out!

402
00:36:18,766 --> 00:36:20,142
Tonight's gonna be killer.

403
00:36:21,185 --> 00:36:24,534
Kara, I swear. One of these days, you're gonna get lost in that thing.

404
00:36:24,605 --> 00:36:28,525
- I can't find my term paper. - So copy someone else's. I do it all the time.

405
00:36:28,734 --> 00:36:29,943
Works primo.

406
00:36:30,611 --> 00:36:32,362
Oh, shit!

407
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:39,244
Looks like your little boy has got himself quite an imagination.

408
00:36:42,289 --> 00:36:43,957
He's been having nightmares.

409
00:36:45,709 --> 00:36:47,086
I think it's cool.

410
00:36:47,961 --> 00:36:51,423
- Must be some nightmares. - Beth, we got work to do.

411
00:36:54,136 --> 00:36:55,145
Hey...

412
00:36:55,385 --> 00:36:56,845
Are you gonna be okay?

413
00:36:58,764 --> 00:36:59,769
"Thorn"?

414
00:37:54,278 --> 00:37:55,737
I need to see a doctor.

415
00:37:55,946 --> 00:37:58,480
- What seems to be the problem? - Uh, it's my baby.

416
00:37:58,699 --> 00:37:59,995
There's been an accident.

417
00:38:00,033 --> 00:38:03,287
- What kind of accident? - Get me a doctor! Now!

418
00:38:07,207 --> 00:38:08,250
Security?

419
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:11,128
Sam, there's nothing you can do for her now.

420
00:38:11,461 --> 00:38:14,965
Oh. I'll be right back.

421
00:38:16,758 --> 00:38:18,051
Dr. Loomis?

422
00:38:18,521 --> 00:38:19,579
Yeah.

423
00:38:20,762 --> 00:38:22,055
Dr. Loomis...

424
00:38:22,681 --> 00:38:24,224
Thank God you're here.

425
00:38:25,142 --> 00:38:27,409
You heard her last night, didn't you? It was Jamie.

426
00:38:28,103 --> 00:38:29,271
I'm sorry.

427
00:38:29,752 --> 00:38:31,921
- I don't know you, do I? - I'm Tommy.

428
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,811
Tommy Doyle.

429
00:38:34,735 --> 00:38:38,238
Laurie Strode, Jamie's mother, was baby-sitting me the night when...

430
00:38:38,595 --> 00:38:39,907
Tommy Doyle.

431
00:38:41,783 --> 00:38:43,183
What're you doing here?

432
00:38:43,911 --> 00:38:45,078
Please...

433
00:38:45,495 --> 00:38:47,164
I need to know the truth.

434
00:38:48,081 --> 00:38:50,341
Michael Myers has come home, hasn't he?

435
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,179
What do you know about Michael?

436
00:38:54,338 --> 00:38:56,035
I know he's still out there.

437
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:58,842
But people in this town, they want us to believe he's dead,

438
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:01,027
but I know. I've always known.

439
00:39:01,053 --> 00:39:05,139
She's out there fighting for her life. If she should die...

440
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:10,528
- She is the last of his bloodline. - No, Dr. Loomis.

441
00:39:10,896 --> 00:39:12,608
She's not the last.

442
00:39:14,608 --> 00:39:15,888
Oh, God.

443
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:19,123
There's a family. Relatives of the people who adopted Laurie:

444
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:20,308
the Strodes.

445
00:39:20,853 --> 00:39:22,605
They're living in the Myers house.

446
00:39:23,856 --> 00:39:25,733
Dr. Loomis, about Michael...

447
00:39:25,911 --> 00:39:27,894
- It's just a theory of mine-- - That's him.

448
00:39:30,457 --> 00:39:33,710
Meet me tonight. 9:00 at the campus rally.

449
00:39:33,873 --> 00:39:34,916
Tommy, wait!

450
00:39:35,144 --> 00:39:36,181
Wait!

451
00:39:37,381 --> 00:39:38,632
Tommy, wait!

452
00:39:39,675 --> 00:39:41,134
Oh, there you are.

453
00:39:41,343 --> 00:39:42,678
Who is that boy?

454
00:39:42,886 --> 00:39:45,138
An old friend.

455
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:16,005
Great.

456
00:42:06,696 --> 00:42:09,866
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Strode.

457
00:42:10,898 --> 00:42:12,316
Is everything alright?

458
00:42:12,525 --> 00:42:13,818
Who are you?

459
00:42:14,026 --> 00:42:16,654
I came to help your family.

460
00:42:35,381 --> 00:42:37,104
Shh.

461
00:42:39,556 --> 00:42:41,951
Shh. It's okay.

462
00:42:42,749 --> 00:42:43,828
Okay.

463
00:42:45,061 --> 00:42:46,079
Steven.

464
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,654
You like that name?

465
00:42:49,756 --> 00:42:51,534
Yeah, I think it suits you.

466
00:43:02,268 --> 00:43:05,313
It's okay. It's alright.

467
00:43:09,734 --> 00:43:11,985
I won't let anything happen to you.

468
00:43:15,073 --> 00:43:21,204
For 15 years I've been obsessed to find out what was going on inside of him.

469
00:43:22,163 --> 00:43:26,501
It's been my life's work, and my ultimate failure.

470
00:43:26,751 --> 00:43:33,007
This force, this thing that lived inside of him came from a source too violent,

471
00:43:33,216 --> 00:43:35,927
too deadly for you to imagine. It...

472
00:43:36,386 --> 00:43:38,847
It grew inside him.

473
00:43:40,473 --> 00:43:42,673
Contaminating his soul.

474
00:43:44,102 --> 00:43:45,262
It was...

475
00:43:45,854 --> 00:43:47,397
pure evil.

476
00:43:48,356 --> 00:43:51,670
- What makes you think he'll come back here? - This house...

477
00:43:51,693 --> 00:43:54,811
is sacred to him. He has all his memories here.

478
00:43:54,988 --> 00:43:56,531
His rage!

479
00:43:58,241 --> 00:43:59,576
Mrs. Strode...

480
00:43:59,784 --> 00:44:00,803
I beg of you.

481
00:44:00,827 --> 00:44:06,368
Don't let your family suffer the same fate that Laurie and her daughter suffered.

482
00:44:08,835 --> 00:44:12,088
- Jamie? I... I thought that she-- - She's been found.

483
00:44:12,297 --> 00:44:14,287
Outside Haddonfield...

484
00:44:15,413 --> 00:44:16,559
stabbed.

485
00:44:21,973 --> 00:44:23,683
What should I do?

486
00:44:23,892 --> 00:44:28,980
I really am sorry, but you haven't a moment to lose, Mrs. Strode.

487
00:44:29,898 --> 00:44:33,159
Michael Myers has come back to Haddonfield...

488
00:44:34,042 --> 00:44:35,249
to kill.

489
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,564
Strode Real Estate.

490
00:44:40,612 --> 00:44:42,820
John, something terrible's happened.

491
00:44:43,161 --> 00:44:44,954
<i>What do you want now, Deborah?</i>

492
00:44:45,274 --> 00:44:48,861
A man came by the house, a psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.

493
00:44:50,108 --> 00:44:53,444
And he told me about the terrible things that happened here in our house.

494
00:44:53,653 --> 00:44:56,549
Deborah, what the hell are you doing? Talking to strangers, letting 'em in our house?

495
00:44:56,573 --> 00:45:00,014
- John, they found Jamie Lloyd this morning. - Someone tried to kill her.

496
00:45:00,041 --> 00:45:01,953
<i>Deborah, I don't know what the hell you're talking about.</i>

497
00:45:01,964 --> 00:45:05,250
<i>Christ! You ought to stop watching those damn TV talkshows.</i>

498
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:07,134
I'm getting the children out of here.

499
00:45:07,145 --> 00:45:09,321
At least until I know what's going on.

500
00:45:12,213 --> 00:45:14,048
John, I want you to come with us.

501
00:45:14,299 --> 00:45:16,175
You know. You know, Deborah.

502
00:45:16,426 --> 00:45:19,679
You've lost it. You know that, Deborah? You've just lost it.

503
00:45:20,096 --> 00:45:22,428
The reason you moved us into this house...

504
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:25,977
Your brother could never sell it because of what happened here, could he?

505
00:45:27,408 --> 00:45:28,629
And you knew.

506
00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:31,460
And you didn't tell us, John.

507
00:45:32,121 --> 00:45:33,456
You knew.

508
00:45:34,415 --> 00:45:36,167
Goddamnit!

509
00:46:03,653 --> 00:46:05,575
Happy Halloween, little girl.

510
00:46:49,878 --> 00:46:50,878
Hello?

511
00:46:50,981 --> 00:46:52,816
<i>We want the child.</i>

512
00:46:53,191 --> 00:46:54,613
Who is this?

513
00:47:25,474 --> 00:47:26,641
Oh, Michael.

514
00:47:38,403 --> 00:47:40,947
<i>I'm coming.</i>

515
00:47:41,004 --> 00:47:43,318
<i>Yeah, I'm coming.</i>

516
00:47:43,575 --> 00:47:48,497
<i>Get ready, oh, yes! Yeah. Yes.</i>

517
00:47:48,525 --> 00:47:52,268
<i>I'm coming, alright, and you'd better be there at the Halloween Harvest fair.</i>

518
00:47:52,375 --> 00:47:54,623
<i>Let's do it, together.</i>

519
00:48:13,584 --> 00:48:14,939
Sorry.

520
00:48:56,356 --> 00:48:58,650
Mom? I'm home!

521
00:49:00,569 --> 00:49:01,653
Hello?

522
00:49:04,489 --> 00:49:05,740
Mom!

523
00:50:09,471 --> 00:50:10,759
Mom?

524
00:50:31,076 --> 00:50:32,160
Mom?

525
00:50:33,685 --> 00:50:34,936
Danny?

526
00:50:57,046 --> 00:50:58,131
Mom?

527
00:50:59,174 --> 00:51:00,425
Are you there?

528
00:52:03,761 --> 00:52:05,388
What are you doing here?

529
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,103
I'm your neighbor from across the street.

530
00:52:14,437 --> 00:52:17,315
- Tommy Doyle. - What are you doing with my son?

531
00:52:17,649 --> 00:52:19,108
And... and where's my mother?

532
00:52:20,234 --> 00:52:22,612
She wasn't here... when Danny came home.

533
00:52:22,946 --> 00:52:24,407
Danny, go downstairs.

534
00:52:24,489 --> 00:52:27,700
But Tommy's my new friend. He knows all about dinosaurs.

535
00:52:31,287 --> 00:52:34,144
You're in danger. Come with me.

536
00:52:47,646 --> 00:52:48,839
Hi, Mrs. B!

537
00:53:04,679 --> 00:53:07,557
You don't really expect us to stay here, do you?

538
00:53:07,891 --> 00:53:11,261
I want you to watch your house. You can see everything from that window.

539
00:53:12,896 --> 00:53:14,522
Do you know how insane this is?

540
00:53:14,731 --> 00:53:16,274
Who am I supposed to be looking for?

541
00:53:17,192 --> 00:53:18,225
Him.

542
00:53:24,246 --> 00:53:26,368
Yeah. It's okay.

543
00:53:27,158 --> 00:53:28,583
It's okay, Steven.

544
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,547
Mommy!

545
00:53:40,298 --> 00:53:41,341
Mom!

546
00:53:42,467 --> 00:53:43,760
Not now, Danny.

547
00:54:02,195 --> 00:54:03,408
Here you go.

548
00:54:04,906 --> 00:54:06,017
Come on.

549
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:07,232
What?

550
00:54:08,961 --> 00:54:10,095
Calm down.

551
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:15,250
Here. Let me try.

552
00:54:18,295 --> 00:54:19,348
There.

553
00:54:21,881 --> 00:54:23,069
There.

554
00:54:25,593 --> 00:54:26,698
See?

555
00:54:27,887 --> 00:54:30,056
All it takes is a mother's touch.

556
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:40,519
Uncle Michael, please don't hurt me. Oh, God, please forgive me.

557
00:55:59,187 --> 00:56:01,606
Your work is done now, Jamie.

558
00:56:08,004 --> 00:56:11,216
I let you down again, Jamie.

559
00:56:14,302 --> 00:56:16,680
I never should have left you.

560
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:21,981
Runes were a kind of... early alphabet...

561
00:56:22,012 --> 00:56:26,136
that originated in Northern Europe about 500 B.C.

562
00:56:26,509 --> 00:56:31,818
They were symbols carved out of stone or pieces of wood,

563
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:36,356
used in pagan rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.

564
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:42,944
Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence.

565
00:56:44,057 --> 00:56:47,625
Among the ancient druids, Thorn represented a demon that spread

566
00:56:47,686 --> 00:56:52,941
sickness, destroyed crops, and brought death to hundreds of thousands of people.

567
00:56:53,191 --> 00:56:56,481
According to a Celtic legend, one child from each tribe

568
00:56:56,528 --> 00:56:59,675
was chosen to be inflicted with a curse of Thorn.

569
00:56:59,739 --> 00:57:03,759
To offer the blood sacrifices of its next of kin on the night of Samhain.

570
00:57:03,829 --> 00:57:04,986
Halloween.

571
00:57:05,079 --> 00:57:09,792
The sacrifice of one family meant sparing the lives of an entire tribe.

572
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,921
So why are you so concerned about us if Michael's only out

573
00:57:13,942 --> 00:57:15,117
to kill his family?

574
00:57:15,172 --> 00:57:18,318
In his mind, anyone living in his house is his family.

575
00:57:19,677 --> 00:57:22,430
For years I've been convinced there must be some reason.

576
00:57:22,847 --> 00:57:25,307
Some method behind Michael's madness.

577
00:57:25,808 --> 00:57:28,018
And the common link I found is Thorn.

578
00:57:32,554 --> 00:57:35,609
The druids were also great mathematicians and astronomers.

579
00:57:35,663 --> 00:57:38,131
But the Thorn symbol is actually constellation of stars

580
00:57:38,147 --> 00:57:41,198
that appears from time to time on Halloween night.

581
00:57:42,807 --> 00:57:44,768
Whenever it appears, he appears.

582
00:57:46,603 --> 00:57:51,107
I've traced it back to 1963, when Michael murdered his sister, Judith.

583
00:57:51,524 --> 00:57:54,860
The next time was in 1978; Michael escapes from Smith's Grove.

584
00:57:54,884 --> 00:57:58,218
It happened a decade later, and the year after that. He kills again.

585
00:57:58,365 --> 00:58:02,474
Now Jamie says Michael is back, and for the first time in 6 years,

586
00:58:02,529 --> 00:58:05,251
Thorn reappears. Coincidence?

587
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:10,430
What would happen if he succeeded, if he killed the last member of his family?

588
00:58:12,545 --> 00:58:14,339
Well, Michael's power would end,

589
00:58:15,757 --> 00:58:18,301
and the curse would be passed on to another child.

590
00:58:23,098 --> 00:58:24,983
I think that's why these people,

591
00:58:25,433 --> 00:58:28,061
whoever they are, are after Jamie's baby.

592
00:58:29,521 --> 00:58:32,003
To make it Michael's final sacrifice.

593
00:58:40,323 --> 00:58:41,762
Where are you going?

594
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:45,169
To find the only man who can stop him before it's too late.

595
00:58:45,263 --> 00:58:46,503
Oh, no. Where's Danny?

596
00:58:48,927 --> 00:58:49,927
Danny?

597
00:58:50,156 --> 00:58:51,156
Danny!

598
00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:52,589
Mrs. Blankenship!

599
00:58:53,269 --> 00:58:54,276
Have you seen...

600
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:57,617
Danny, don't ever walk off without telling me where you're going!

601
00:58:57,714 --> 00:58:59,113
Take him upstairs.

602
00:58:59,361 --> 00:59:01,404
Lock the door and wait till I get back.

603
00:59:02,036 --> 00:59:03,249
And Kara...

604
00:59:03,657 --> 00:59:04,817
Whatever you do...

605
00:59:06,451 --> 00:59:08,119
Don't go back to your house.

606
00:59:13,309 --> 00:59:16,379
You let him get to her! How could you?

607
00:59:16,395 --> 00:59:20,926
Dr. Loomis, during surgery we discovered that Jamie's uterus was hemorrhaging,

608
00:59:20,941 --> 00:59:22,735
and we found this.

609
00:59:24,987 --> 00:59:26,739
It's placental fluid.

610
00:59:26,947 --> 00:59:30,135
Good God in heaven, do you mean to say--

611
00:59:30,159 --> 00:59:33,523
I estimate she gave birth no more than 24 hours ago.

612
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:36,109
Where is the baby?

613
00:59:37,235 --> 00:59:40,488
I think I... I may already know.

614
00:59:57,630 --> 01:00:00,454
<i>Do you know why we celebrate Halloween?</i>

615
01:00:00,508 --> 01:00:03,922
Because that's when we go trick-or-treating and get candy.

616
01:00:04,131 --> 01:00:05,174
Oh, well...

617
01:00:05,424 --> 01:00:06,801
Yes, but...

618
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:09,887
A long, long time ago,

619
01:00:10,137 --> 01:00:13,367
it was a night of great power,

620
01:00:13,504 --> 01:00:15,893
<i>when the days grew short</i>

621
01:00:16,143 --> 01:00:18,334
<i>and the spirits of the dead</i>

622
01:00:18,437 --> 01:00:21,046
<i>returned to their homes</i>

623
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:24,177
to warm themselves by the fireside.

624
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:29,282
All across the land huge bonfires were lit.

625
01:00:29,654 --> 01:00:33,116
<i>Oh, there was a marvelous celebration.</i>

626
01:00:33,411 --> 01:00:36,696
<i>People danced and they played games.</i>

627
01:00:36,919 --> 01:00:39,333
<i>And they dressed up in costumes.</i>

628
01:00:39,542 --> 01:00:44,640
<i>Hoping to ward off the evil spirits.</i>

629
01:00:44,922 --> 01:00:48,175
Especially the boogeyman.

630
01:00:49,135 --> 01:00:50,708
What's the boogeyman?

631
01:00:52,013 --> 01:00:54,478
Come on, Danny. Say good night to Mrs. Blankenship.

632
01:00:54,557 --> 01:00:57,877
- Good night, Mrs. Blankenship. - He hears the voice, you know.

633
01:00:57,977 --> 01:01:01,257
Just like the other boy that lived in that house.

634
01:01:04,233 --> 01:01:05,567
What are you talking about?

635
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:07,839
I was baby-sitting with him that night.

636
01:01:07,945 --> 01:01:11,041
Little Mikey Myers that lived across the street.

637
01:01:11,115 --> 01:01:16,286
And that's when the voice came, the night he murdered his sister.

638
01:01:16,329 --> 01:01:18,303
Michael heard a voice?

639
01:01:18,706 --> 01:01:22,346
It told him to kill his family.

640
01:01:32,345 --> 01:01:36,499
- Where the hell's Barry? Let's go! - Don't get star-struck on me now.

641
01:01:36,849 --> 01:01:41,966
We got a real agenda here, and Barry is gonna help us get the message out.

642
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:48,608
Hey, look...

643
01:01:55,201 --> 01:01:59,894
Helloooo, Haddonfield!

644
01:02:02,625 --> 01:02:07,726
- Barry! - <i>WKNB presents "Back Talk" with Barry Simms.</i>

645
01:02:07,755 --> 01:02:10,939
- <i>Live from Haddonfield, Illinois,</i> - Barry!

646
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:13,576
<i>the home of Michael Myers!</i>

647
01:02:21,677 --> 01:02:22,970
Deborah!

648
01:02:23,887 --> 01:02:25,375
I'm home!

649
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:29,437
Thanks for the dinner.

650
01:02:37,568 --> 01:02:39,194
Come out, come out...

651
01:02:39,403 --> 01:02:40,612
Wherever you are.

652
01:02:50,289 --> 01:02:51,957
Goddamnit.

653
01:02:52,791 --> 01:02:54,519
She actually left.

654
01:02:56,158 --> 01:02:57,251
Shoot.

655
01:03:02,092 --> 01:03:03,760
I know what's going on.

656
01:03:05,804 --> 01:03:09,141
It must be the boogeyman.

657
01:03:09,516 --> 01:03:11,226
Here I come, boogeyman.

658
01:03:11,643 --> 01:03:14,104
'Cause, you know, I am really scared.

659
01:03:46,416 --> 01:03:47,804
What the hell?

660
01:03:48,646 --> 01:03:50,140
The power's off.

661
01:05:21,773 --> 01:05:23,900
Tell me, kids, how's it feel to...

662
01:05:24,109 --> 01:05:28,989
finally pull Halloween out of the proverbial Haddonfield closet?

663
01:05:29,197 --> 01:05:30,742
What we're saying here is...

664
01:05:30,782 --> 01:05:35,078
we will no longer let the powers that be control our minds.

665
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:36,323
For years...

666
01:05:36,496 --> 01:05:40,142
Halloween has represented everything that's wrong with Haddonfield.

667
01:05:40,375 --> 01:05:42,673
But Michael Myers is long gone.

668
01:05:42,961 --> 01:05:45,789
There is NO boogeyman!

669
01:05:45,873 --> 01:05:47,004
Whoa!

670
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:50,510
Does she get this riled up in the sack, Tim?

671
01:05:50,633 --> 01:05:54,345
I bet she wears crotchless panties and barks like a dog.

672
01:05:54,515 --> 01:05:55,535
Beth...

673
01:05:56,305 --> 01:05:58,358
What do you say, honey? You and me, uh...

674
01:06:00,768 --> 01:06:02,261
As I was saying...

675
01:06:02,561 --> 01:06:04,677
We have to stop acting out of fear.

676
01:06:05,064 --> 01:06:07,024
Just look at Tim's family.

677
01:06:07,775 --> 01:06:09,819
They live in the Myers house.

678
01:06:11,362 --> 01:06:12,567
You do?

679
01:06:12,938 --> 01:06:13,962
We do?

680
01:06:15,074 --> 01:06:17,147
Uh... yeah, we do.

681
01:06:17,576 --> 01:06:18,953
Great house.

682
01:06:19,286 --> 01:06:23,040
- Strong wood. - I see. You mean to tell me you actually live...

683
01:06:23,374 --> 01:06:24,500
in the house...

684
01:06:24,709 --> 01:06:27,545
of the most brutal mass murderer in history?

685
01:06:29,797 --> 01:06:32,392
This is the Barry Simms show.

686
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:34,260
And when we return...

687
01:06:34,719 --> 01:06:36,512
we'll be coming at you live...

688
01:06:36,721 --> 01:06:37,729
from the one...

689
01:06:37,901 --> 01:06:38,902
the only...

690
01:06:39,223 --> 01:06:41,788
Myers house. How's that for a Halloween shock-fest?

691
01:06:44,671 --> 01:06:45,858
How far to your house, kid?

692
01:06:45,922 --> 01:06:47,840
About half a mile, but I don't know if my folks--

693
01:06:47,864 --> 01:06:49,506
That's good, I'll meet you there in five.

694
01:06:49,528 --> 01:06:51,809
What about the kids? We're supposed to throw all the candy.

695
01:06:51,824 --> 01:06:52,936
Phone!

696
01:06:52,957 --> 01:06:54,511
Relax your crack, sweetheart.

697
01:06:54,542 --> 01:06:57,642
Quick tootle around the old household and we'll be right on back.

698
01:06:57,666 --> 01:07:02,229
Pull the van outback, so that I can sneak out of here nice and quietly.

699
01:07:03,022 --> 01:07:05,718
Oh, no. No, no, really, really. You're too good to me. Really.

700
01:07:06,514 --> 01:07:09,634
No. Thanks for putting me in the middle of this cheap-shit country bumpkin outfit, Paul.

701
01:07:09,658 --> 01:07:11,010
I really appreciate it!

702
01:07:11,268 --> 01:07:13,062
My fans expect better than this.

703
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:16,771
No, no. Look, you tell that penny-pinching whiner Mike Sarducci that when I get back,

704
01:07:16,802 --> 01:07:20,352
I am personally gonna cut off his balls and wear 'em as earrings.

705
01:07:21,854 --> 01:07:23,481
Where's the goddamn van? God!

706
01:07:23,689 --> 01:07:27,726
Oh, no, I'm trotting out for a cheeseburger. I'm taking the show to the real Myers house,

707
01:07:27,758 --> 01:07:29,799
where we should have done it in the first place.

708
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:37,203
Ten minutes in that house and I'll have every fruitcake medium in the country

709
01:07:37,259 --> 01:07:40,998
calling in trying to channel the spirit of that pussy Michael Myers.

710
01:07:42,666 --> 01:07:44,361
Sure, we can do another show about him.

711
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,934
Kick the audience in the face enough and they'll lick you all over.

712
01:07:48,416 --> 01:07:51,016
I'll call you when I get back, Paul. Bye-bye.

713
01:07:53,594 --> 01:07:55,387
Where the f...

714
01:08:25,793 --> 01:08:27,087
What happened to the lights?

715
01:08:28,587 --> 01:08:30,548
Do you really think Barry's gonna show up?

716
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:32,925
Let's hope not.

717
01:08:33,342 --> 01:08:35,928
I'm sorry he turned out to be such an asshole.

718
01:08:37,054 --> 01:08:38,264
It's okay.

719
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:40,724
Where is everyone?

720
01:08:40,933 --> 01:08:41,934
Mom?

721
01:08:42,166 --> 01:08:43,166
Kara?

722
01:08:43,227 --> 01:08:44,854
They're probably at the fair,

723
01:08:45,271 --> 01:08:46,772
which is where we should be.

724
01:08:46,981 --> 01:08:48,083
Beth...

725
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,242
Um...

726
01:08:49,441 --> 01:08:52,236
What you said before about Michael Myers living in our house.

727
01:08:53,070 --> 01:08:54,321
Is that really true?

728
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:59,410
It was a cold Halloween night.

729
01:08:59,952 --> 01:09:02,746
He stood in the shadows, watching through the windows...

730
01:09:03,164 --> 01:09:05,291
as his sister and her boyfriend made love.

731
01:09:05,995 --> 01:09:07,746
Then he crept inside...

732
01:09:08,127 --> 01:09:09,837
picked up a huge butcher knife...

733
01:09:10,045 --> 01:09:12,840
and made his way up these stairs.

734
01:09:13,007 --> 01:09:14,842
He raised the knife up behind her...

735
01:09:15,329 --> 01:09:16,789
She turned around...

736
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:18,387
and he stabbed her!

737
01:09:20,514 --> 01:09:22,099
Cut it out, Beth!

738
01:09:23,601 --> 01:09:26,645
I really didn't know that Michael Myers lived in my house, okay?

739
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:28,567
It freaks me out.

740
01:09:29,982 --> 01:09:31,207
I'm sorry.

741
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:34,737
I was just fooling around.

742
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:36,328
It's okay.

743
01:09:42,703 --> 01:09:43,954
Let's get the candles.

744
01:09:44,705 --> 01:09:46,040
Just a minute.

745
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:58,260
- ? Mommy, it's raining. - It's raining red. ?

746
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:01,889
?  Mommy, it's raining. It's raining red. ?

747
01:10:02,762 --> 01:10:05,890
? Mommy, it's raining. It's raining red.  ?

748
01:10:06,623 --> 01:10:08,673
? Mommy, it's raining red. ?

749
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:12,997
? Mommy, it's raining. It's raining red.  ?

750
01:10:13,442 --> 01:10:16,737
?  Mommy, it's raining. It's raining red. ?

751
01:10:17,321 --> 01:10:20,699
? Mommy, it's raining. It's raining red.  ?

752
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:23,786
? Mommy, it's raining red. ?

753
01:10:26,413 --> 01:10:27,665
It's warm.

754
01:10:28,499 --> 01:10:30,292
Why is it warm?

755
01:10:54,910 --> 01:10:56,161
Dr. Loomis.

756
01:10:57,194 --> 01:10:58,591
It's happening.

757
01:11:04,924 --> 01:11:08,093
Your sister would kill us if she knew we did it in her bed.

758
01:11:09,011 --> 01:11:10,596
Hey, that was your idea.

759
01:11:11,513 --> 01:11:13,390
I am bad, aren't I?

760
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:18,238
Only when you wear crotchless panties and bark like a dog.

761
01:11:25,365 --> 01:11:26,491
Where are you going?

762
01:11:26,731 --> 01:11:28,065
I gotta take a shower.

763
01:11:29,657 --> 01:11:30,950
You know, to stay fresh.

764
01:11:38,332 --> 01:11:40,292
Watch out for the boogeyman.

765
01:12:07,152 --> 01:12:09,697
Hey, Beth, can you bring a towel in here? I'm freezing.

766
01:12:10,948 --> 01:12:12,491
Where are you when I need you, honey?

767
01:12:20,452 --> 01:12:21,458
Thanks.

768
01:12:22,501 --> 01:12:23,794
I'll be in, in a minute.

769
01:12:48,118 --> 01:12:49,209
Mommy?

770
01:12:51,884 --> 01:12:53,928
Hold on a second, Danny.

771
01:12:56,410 --> 01:12:59,455
<i>Danny... Come to me...</i>

772
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:03,464
- Hello? - Mom? Wait, who is this?

773
01:13:03,565 --> 01:13:04,755
<i>No, this is Beth.</i>

774
01:13:05,525 --> 01:13:06,735
What are you doing there?

775
01:13:06,944 --> 01:13:09,773
- <i>Do you know where my mother is?</i> - She's not home. No one is.

776
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:10,877
What's wrong?

777
01:13:11,031 --> 01:13:12,408
Is Tim with you?

778
01:13:12,824 --> 01:13:14,076
<i>He's in the shower.</i>

779
01:13:15,744 --> 01:13:17,252
I'm across the street.

780
01:13:17,537 --> 01:13:18,705
<i>I can see you.</i>

781
01:13:18,914 --> 01:13:20,580
Beth, I want you to listen to me.

782
01:13:20,666 --> 01:13:23,022
Get Tim and get out of that house. Right now.

783
01:13:23,085 --> 01:13:24,850
Kara, what the hell is going on?

784
01:13:24,878 --> 01:13:28,090
Look out! There's someone in the room. He's right behind you!

785
01:13:45,232 --> 01:13:46,569
No!

786
01:13:51,238 --> 01:13:52,463
No!

787
01:13:52,739 --> 01:13:54,144
Danny, no!

788
01:13:54,658 --> 01:13:55,826
Danny.

789
01:14:00,334 --> 01:14:01,370
Danny.

790
01:15:56,785 --> 01:15:57,890
Danny?

791
01:16:08,296 --> 01:16:09,322
Danny?

792
01:16:10,506 --> 01:16:11,506
Danny.

793
01:16:11,883 --> 01:16:13,051
Mommy?

794
01:16:13,593 --> 01:16:14,624
It's okay.

795
01:16:16,596 --> 01:16:17,764
Danny, run!

796
01:18:04,088 --> 01:18:05,096
Danny.

797
01:18:05,272 --> 01:18:07,066
Come to mommy.

798
01:18:10,246 --> 01:18:11,915
Danny, please.

799
01:19:00,337 --> 01:19:01,337
The baby.

800
01:19:01,504 --> 01:19:02,630
Where's the baby?

801
01:19:02,746 --> 01:19:03,922
Please!

802
01:19:04,113 --> 01:19:05,386
Open the door!

803
01:19:05,535 --> 01:19:06,538
Please!

804
01:19:06,549 --> 01:19:09,542
Open the door! Someone help us!

805
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:13,995
Please, somebody help us!

806
01:19:16,267 --> 01:19:17,644
Help us, please!

807
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:21,018
Help us, please!

808
01:19:26,778 --> 01:19:27,965
Get 'em upstairs!

809
01:19:28,028 --> 01:19:29,043
Now!

810
01:19:29,114 --> 01:19:30,262
Where's the baby?

811
01:19:30,490 --> 01:19:31,588
He's gone.

812
01:19:32,784 --> 01:19:33,993
Who else knew I had the baby?

813
01:19:34,202 --> 01:19:35,453
- No one. - No!

814
01:19:35,704 --> 01:19:37,661
There had to be someone else...

815
01:19:37,786 --> 01:19:40,883
- Who knew? - Nobody knew except me and...

816
01:19:40,894 --> 01:19:43,837
<i>Danny. Come to me.</i>

817
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:51,781
<i>Danny. Come to me.</i>

818
01:19:55,807 --> 01:19:58,101
<i>Come Danny, come to me.</i>

819
01:20:06,298 --> 01:20:07,343
Danny, no.

820
01:20:09,330 --> 01:20:10,334
No.

821
01:20:10,572 --> 01:20:11,718
Please.

822
01:20:15,869 --> 01:20:17,361
Careful with the girl.

823
01:20:18,997 --> 01:20:20,108
Kara!

824
01:20:21,207 --> 01:20:22,263
Wynn.

825
01:20:30,154 --> 01:20:33,324
Mrs. Blankenship! Oh, God, hurry! We have to...

826
01:20:33,762 --> 01:20:35,305
Hello, dear.

827
01:21:17,886 --> 01:21:18,887
Where is she?

828
01:21:19,096 --> 01:21:20,222
Where's Kara?

829
01:21:22,182 --> 01:21:23,726
I feel like I've been drugged.

830
01:21:23,934 --> 01:21:25,310
We have been drugged.

831
01:21:25,519 --> 01:21:26,729
Why are they doing this?

832
01:21:27,479 --> 01:21:29,148
Why didn't they just kill us?

833
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:31,734
It's his game.

834
01:21:33,277 --> 01:21:36,071
And I know where he wants to play it.

835
01:22:03,474 --> 01:22:07,227
- Dr. Loomis, you know that can't stop Michael. - Nothing will stop Michael.

836
01:22:08,084 --> 01:22:09,177
But...

837
01:22:09,605 --> 01:22:10,647
Wynn.

838
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:14,784
I tried to tell you in the hospital.

839
01:22:15,999 --> 01:22:19,253
I think Michael is under the influence of an evil rune.

840
01:22:20,129 --> 01:22:21,714
Thorn.

841
01:22:23,463 --> 01:22:28,429
I saw the symbol marked up where we found Jamie stabbed.

842
01:22:28,637 --> 01:22:31,596
Well, there are runes of light... Protection.

843
01:22:32,266 --> 01:22:36,750
If Thorn could somehow be trapped by these runes the energies could cancel themselves out.

844
01:22:36,761 --> 01:22:38,531
The evil could be destroyed.

845
01:22:40,107 --> 01:22:41,942
You wait here.

846
01:22:42,151 --> 01:22:44,479
Don't go anywhere until I come back.

847
01:22:45,984 --> 01:22:47,024
Wynn.

848
01:22:56,206 --> 01:22:58,959
About time, Dr. Loomis.

849
01:23:00,252 --> 01:23:02,171
Welcome to your fate.

850
01:23:02,379 --> 01:23:05,090
The time has come for you to know the truth.

851
01:23:05,674 --> 01:23:09,720
The time has come for you to join us.

852
01:23:11,221 --> 01:23:14,308
Why now?

853
01:23:14,516 --> 01:23:17,008
After Jamie escaped last night, I knew that she would come to you,

854
01:23:17,019 --> 01:23:20,295
and I knew that you would lead us to her baby.

855
01:23:20,481 --> 01:23:23,480
Her very special baby.

856
01:23:24,193 --> 01:23:28,614
I needed her, just as I need you now.

857
01:23:29,406 --> 01:23:33,660
It's your destiny, Sam. It lives inside you.

858
01:23:33,869 --> 01:23:36,622
It always has. You know that, don't you?

859
01:23:36,914 --> 01:23:38,046
You...

860
01:23:40,042 --> 01:23:41,207
are...

861
01:23:42,544 --> 01:23:44,084
a madman.

862
01:24:32,344 --> 01:24:34,096
<i>Look around you, Sam.</i>

863
01:24:35,138 --> 01:24:37,349
<i>Madness everywhere.</i>

864
01:24:37,558 --> 01:24:41,798
Famine, war, a great plague.

865
01:24:42,189 --> 01:24:48,318
These are signs that we must restore balance to the natural order of things.

866
01:24:49,278 --> 01:24:52,862
- We merely provide the means. - Michael?

867
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:57,828
We've given him the power. The gift of Thorn.

868
01:24:58,036 --> 01:25:03,542
I am its deliverer. I follow it, act as its guardian.

869
01:25:04,418 --> 01:25:07,170
I protect Michael, watch over him.

870
01:25:08,753 --> 01:25:12,301
And now it's time for another.

871
01:25:13,635 --> 01:25:15,497
Now it's time for you...

872
01:25:16,263 --> 01:25:17,814
Dr. Loomis.

873
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:23,269
I thought Michael was a monster.

874
01:25:23,645 --> 01:25:24,928
But you...

875
01:25:36,957 --> 01:25:38,243
Leave him there.

876
01:25:39,119 --> 01:25:40,913
It's his office now.

877
01:26:09,441 --> 01:26:12,235
Spirits and powers of the flame.

878
01:26:14,404 --> 01:26:17,324
Attend and witness this ritual.

879
01:26:20,035 --> 01:26:22,341
Bear our gifts to Thorn.

880
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,828
Open us to the path of darkness.

881
01:26:31,672 --> 01:26:34,796
By these runes transform us.

882
01:26:35,676 --> 01:26:42,032
Let the hammer descend on the chosen one to whom we offer this sacrifice

883
01:26:42,099 --> 01:26:44,558
of innocent blood.

884
01:26:49,606 --> 01:26:54,283
And then, Danny, your journey begins.

885
01:26:54,987 --> 01:26:56,780
Kill for him.

886
01:26:58,365 --> 01:26:59,658
No.

887
01:27:00,909 --> 01:27:04,788
Michael, your final sacrifice.

888
01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:09,835
Michael, you can make him stop it.

889
01:27:11,461 --> 01:27:14,798
Don't kill the baby. You can stop it.

890
01:27:18,677 --> 01:27:21,299
You know whose baby it is, don't you?

891
01:27:21,638 --> 01:27:24,433
- Michael! - The baby is yours, isn't it?

892
01:27:24,641 --> 01:27:26,518
Isn't it, Michael?

893
01:27:28,437 --> 01:27:29,938
Back off!

894
01:27:30,814 --> 01:27:34,234
- Untie her. - Do as he says. Do it!

895
01:27:35,819 --> 01:27:38,196
You should join us, you have talent.

896
01:27:38,405 --> 01:27:39,614
Shut up.

897
01:27:39,823 --> 01:27:42,576
Danny, come on.

898
01:27:42,784 --> 01:27:45,518
Go! Okay? Let's go.

899
01:27:58,884 --> 01:28:00,129
Run!

900
01:28:01,762 --> 01:28:02,763
Go!

901
01:28:04,181 --> 01:28:05,538
Go, go!

902
01:28:27,704 --> 01:28:29,498
Move it! Go, go!

903
01:28:34,377 --> 01:28:35,670
Shit!

904
01:28:36,588 --> 01:28:40,175
- Come on! - It's not working.

905
01:28:40,383 --> 01:28:42,511
Come on. it's not working!

906
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:45,013
It's not...

907
01:29:01,209 --> 01:29:03,003
Back up from the gates!

908
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:09,845
Get 'em out of here!

909
01:29:11,990 --> 01:29:15,786
Get in there! Go on, get in!

910
01:29:18,708 --> 01:29:20,251
Mommy!

911
01:29:34,599 --> 01:29:36,351
Samhain.

912
01:29:58,331 --> 01:30:00,208
Tommy! Where is he?

913
01:30:00,307 --> 01:30:03,185
It worked. The power of the runes stopped him.

914
01:30:06,547 --> 01:30:07,840
Michael.

915
01:30:10,843 --> 01:30:12,345
What have they done to you?

916
01:30:28,361 --> 01:30:32,361
- Where do we go now? - As far away from Haddonfield as possible.

917
01:30:32,782 --> 01:30:38,579
- Come with us. - No, I have a little business to attend to here.

918
01:31:11,362 --> 01:31:12,697
Michael.

919
01:31:19,829 --> 01:31:21,164
Michael.

920
01:31:23,041 --> 01:31:24,500
It's all over.

921
01:31:24,917 --> 01:31:26,502
It's all over!

922
01:31:29,547 --> 01:31:31,674
It's all over now.

923
01:31:40,266 --> 01:31:41,309
Michael.

924
01:31:42,101 --> 01:31:43,895
Michael's gone.

925
01:31:45,938 --> 01:31:48,941
It's your game now, Dr. Loomis.
