1
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:49,942
'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.

2
00:02:51,654 --> 00:02:56,591
But who shall lead our business
against the Turkish fleet?

3
00:02:58,228 --> 00:02:59,490
Othello.

4
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,792
Another of his fathom
we have none.

5
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:07,697
The fortitude of the place
is best known to him.

6
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,788
I take it much unkindly
that thou, lago...

7
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,060
...who hast had my purse
as if the strings were thine...

8
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,101
...shouldst know of this.

9
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,570
By the faith of man,
I know my price.

10
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:50,712
I am worth no worse a place.
But he, one Michael Cassio...

11
00:03:50,914 --> 00:03:55,544
...a Florentine,
must his lieutenant be.

12
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:59,447
And l, of whom
his eyes had seen the proof--

13
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:04,116
--God bless the mark!--
his Moorship's ensign.

14
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,524
O by heaven, I rather
would have been his hangman.

15
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:12,463
Why, there's no remedy.
'Tis the curse of service.

16
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:17,601
I would not follow him then.

17
00:04:17,807 --> 00:04:20,708
O, sir, content you.

18
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,676
I follow him
to serve my turn upon him.

19
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:29,818
We cannot all be masters, nor
all masters cannot be truly followed.

20
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,116
You shall mark...

21
00:04:32,388 --> 00:04:36,882
...heaven is my judge,
not I for love and duty...

22
00:04:37,093 --> 00:04:41,189
...but seeming so for my peculiar end.

23
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:45,299
I am not what I am.

24
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:52,407
What a full fortune does the thick-
lips owe, if he can carry it thus.

25
00:04:54,243 --> 00:04:57,007
Call up her father.

26
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:13,591
Awake! Thieves! Signor!

27
00:05:13,796 --> 00:05:17,391
Thieves! Look to your house,
your daughter and your bags!

28
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:19,498
Signor Brabantio!
Ho!

29
00:05:20,203 --> 00:05:21,101
-Awake!
-Sir!

30
00:05:21,304 --> 00:05:24,831
Thieves! Look to your house, your
daughter and your bags!

31
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,703
Thieves! Thieves!

32
00:05:28,778 --> 00:05:31,212
What is the reason
of this terrible summons?

33
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,507
What is the matter here?

34
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,944
Signor...

35
00:05:39,522 --> 00:05:41,786
...is all your family within?

36
00:05:41,991 --> 00:05:44,516
I know you, Roderigo...

37
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,458
...and have charged thee
not to haunt about my doors.

38
00:05:48,664 --> 00:05:51,189
In honest plainness,
thou has heard me say...

39
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:53,494
...my daughter is not for thee.

40
00:05:53,703 --> 00:05:55,830
Are your doors locked?

41
00:05:56,806 --> 00:05:59,036
Why? Wherefore ask you this?

42
00:05:59,242 --> 00:06:02,177
Even now, now, very now...

43
00:06:02,378 --> 00:06:06,144
...an old black ram
is tupping your white ewe.

44
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:08,442
What profane wretch art thou?

45
00:06:08,651 --> 00:06:10,312
I am one
that comes to tell you...

46
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,614
...your daughter and the Moor are
making the beast with two backs.

47
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:14,881
Thou art a villain.

48
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:17,286
You are a senator.

49
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:20,755
This thou shalt answer, Roderigo.

50
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,055
Ay, sir!

51
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:24,190
I will answer anything.

52
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,267
But I beseech you,
straight satisfy yourself:

53
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:30,899
If she be in her chamber
or your house...

54
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:35,601
...let loose on me the justice
of the state for thus deluding you.

55
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:40,046
Strike on the tinder, ho!

56
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:43,377
Give me a taper!
Call up all my people!

57
00:06:45,688 --> 00:06:48,953
This accident is not unlike my dream.

58
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:51,692
Belief of it oppresses me already.

59
00:06:52,528 --> 00:06:54,325
Light, I say!

60
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,929
Light!

61
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,995
Get weapons, ho!

62
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:04,268
Farewell, for I must leave you.

63
00:07:22,325 --> 00:07:25,351
The goodness of the night
upon you, friends.

64
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,095
I pray you, sir,
are you fast married?

65
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:36,529
Sir, you've been hotly called for.

66
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,299
Have with you.

67
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:56,284
-Halt!
-You!

68
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:02,464
lKeep up your bright swords,
for the dew will rust them.

69
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,830
O, thou foul thief!

70
00:08:07,036 --> 00:08:09,231
Where hast thou stowed my daughter?

71
00:08:09,438 --> 00:08:12,066
Damned as thou art,
thou hast enchanted her...

72
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:17,144
...to run from her garden to the sooty
bosom of such a thing as thou.

73
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:24,448
Lay hold upon him.

74
00:08:24,654 --> 00:08:26,417
Hold your hands...

75
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,247
...both you of my inclining
and the rest.

76
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:35,928
Were it my cue to fight, I should have
known it without a prompter.

77
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,367
Good signor...

78
00:08:40,303 --> 00:08:42,533
...where will you that I go
to answer this, your charge?

79
00:08:42,738 --> 00:08:44,103
To prison...

80
00:08:44,307 --> 00:08:47,640
...till fit time of law and course of
direct session call thee to answer.

81
00:08:47,843 --> 00:08:49,868
What if I do obey?

82
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,672
How may the Duke
be therewith satisfied...

83
00:08:52,882 --> 00:08:57,342
...whose messengers are
here about my side to bring me to him?

84
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,347
'Tis true,
most worthy signor.

85
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:02,649
The Duke's in council, and your
noble self, surely, is sent for.

86
00:09:02,858 --> 00:09:05,986
How? The Duke in council?
In this time of night?

87
00:09:06,862 --> 00:09:08,193
Bring him away.

88
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,779
Valiant Othello...

89
00:09:32,054 --> 00:09:35,888
...we must straight employ you
against the general Turkish foe.

90
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:38,925
Welcome, gentle signor.

91
00:09:39,128 --> 00:09:42,029
We lacked your counsel
and your help tonight.

92
00:09:42,231 --> 00:09:43,721
So did I yours.

93
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,892
Good Your Grace, pardon me.

94
00:09:46,102 --> 00:09:48,627
Neither my place,
nor aught I heard of business...

95
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,965
...has raised me from my bed.

96
00:09:51,874 --> 00:09:53,171
My daughter!

97
00:09:54,644 --> 00:09:55,736
O, my daughter!

98
00:09:55,945 --> 00:09:56,877
Dead?

99
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,077
She is abused,
stolen from me and corrupted.

100
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:06,487
For nature so preposterously to err,
sans witchcraft could not.

101
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:11,089
Whoever he be
that in this foul proceeding...

102
00:10:11,294 --> 00:10:16,231
...hath thus beguiled your daughter
of herself, and you of her...

103
00:10:16,565 --> 00:10:20,194
...the bloody book of law you
shall yourself read...

104
00:10:20,403 --> 00:10:24,533
...in the bitter letter after
your own sense.

105
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:29,273
Humbly, I thank Your Grace.

106
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,782
Here is the man.

107
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:46,790
Othello?

108
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:49,589
What in your own part can you
say to this?

109
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:52,290
Nothing, but this is so.

110
00:10:58,808 --> 00:11:03,745
Most potent, grave
and reverend signors...

111
00:11:04,847 --> 00:11:08,180
...my very noble
and approved good masters...

112
00:11:09,352 --> 00:11:12,412
...that I have taken away this
old man's daughter...

113
00:11:12,621 --> 00:11:15,488
...'tis most true.
True, I have married her.

114
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:20,254
The very head and front of my offending
hath this extent, no more.

115
00:11:20,896 --> 00:11:22,955
Rude am I in my speech...

116
00:11:23,165 --> 00:11:27,932
...and little blessed
with the soft phrase of peace.

117
00:11:28,137 --> 00:11:31,265
For since these arms of mine
had seven years' pith...

118
00:11:31,474 --> 00:11:33,442
...till now some nine moons wasted...

119
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:36,805
...they have used their dearest action
in the tented field.

120
00:11:37,012 --> 00:11:39,913
And little of this great world
can I speak...

121
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:43,552
...more than pertains to feats
of broil and battle.

122
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:46,583
Therefore, little shall l
grace my cause...

123
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:50,987
...in speaking of myself.
Yet, by your gracious patience...

124
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:55,425
...l will a round,
unvarnished tale deliver...

125
00:11:55,698 --> 00:11:58,064
...of my whole course of love:

126
00:11:58,267 --> 00:12:01,634
What drugs, what charms...

127
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:06,137
...what conjuration
and what mighty magic--

128
00:12:06,342 --> 00:12:11,075
--for such proceedings am l
charged withal -- I won his daughter.

129
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,077
A maiden never bold...

130
00:12:13,282 --> 00:12:16,877
...of spirit so still and quiet
that her motion blushed at herself...

131
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:19,554
...and she, in spite of nature,
to fall in love...

132
00:12:19,755 --> 00:12:21,655
...with what she feared to look on!

133
00:12:21,857 --> 00:12:23,848
I do beseech you, send for the lady...

134
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:26,289
...and let her speak of me
before her father.

135
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,963
If you do find me foul in her report...

136
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,931
...the trust, the office I do hold
of you, not only take away...

137
00:12:33,135 --> 00:12:36,696
...but let your sentence even
fall upon my life.

138
00:12:40,109 --> 00:12:41,576
Fetch Desdemona.

139
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,713
Her father loved me...

140
00:12:55,057 --> 00:12:56,922
...oft invited me...

141
00:12:57,393 --> 00:13:01,056
...still questioned me the story
of my life from year to year...

142
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:05,632
...the battles, sieges, fortunes
that I have passed.

143
00:13:05,835 --> 00:13:08,099
Even from my boyish days...

144
00:13:08,304 --> 00:13:10,067
...to the moment
he bade me tell it.

145
00:13:10,272 --> 00:13:12,604
Wherein I spoke of
most disastrous chances...

146
00:13:12,808 --> 00:13:15,208
...of moving accidents by
flood and field...

147
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:18,710
...hair-breadth escapes
in the imminent deadly breach...

148
00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:21,940
...of being taken by the insolent foe...

149
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:24,676
...and sold to slavery.

150
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,447
And of the cannibals that
each other eat...

151
00:13:27,656 --> 00:13:29,419
... the Anthropophagi...

152
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:33,026
...and men whose heads do grow
beneath their shoulders.

153
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,596
These things to hear
would Desdemona seriously incline.

154
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:41,736
And with a greedy ear
devour up my discourse...

155
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,936
... which I observing...

156
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,501
... took once a pliant hour...

157
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:49,974
...and found means to dra w
from her a prayer of earnest heart...

158
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:52,807
... which I would
all my pilgrimage dilate.

159
00:13:53,148 --> 00:13:56,174
She gave me for my pains...

160
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,554
...a world of sighs.

161
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:03,054
She swore, in faith, 'twas strange...

162
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,558
... 'twas passing strange,
'twas pitiful...

163
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,821
... 'twas wondrous pitiful.

164
00:14:12,301 --> 00:14:15,031
She loved me
for the dangers I had passed...

165
00:14:15,237 --> 00:14:18,206
...and I loved her
that she did pity them.

166
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:22,908
This only is
the witchcraft I have used.

167
00:14:35,824 --> 00:14:38,657
Come hither, gentle mistress.

168
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:45,498
Do you perceive in all this company
where most you owe obedience?

169
00:14:48,237 --> 00:14:50,262
My noble father...

170
00:14:50,873 --> 00:14:54,900
...to you I am bound
for life and education.

171
00:14:55,544 --> 00:15:00,277
My life and education both
do learn me how to respect you.

172
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:03,383
You are lord of all my duty.

173
00:15:04,086 --> 00:15:06,418
I am hitherto your daughter.

174
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,681
But here's my husband.

175
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,320
And so much duty
as my mother showed to you...

176
00:15:16,532 --> 00:15:18,864
...preferring you before her father...

177
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:23,471
...so much I challenge
that I may profess due to the Moor...

178
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,230
...my lord.

179
00:15:32,314 --> 00:15:35,112
God by you! I have done.

180
00:15:36,752 --> 00:15:41,018
I had rather to adopt a child
than get it.

181
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:45,321
Come hither, Moor.

182
00:15:49,798 --> 00:15:52,596
I here do give thee that
with all my heart...

183
00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:55,395
...which, but thou hast already...

184
00:15:55,604 --> 00:16:00,541
...with all my heart I would
keep from thee.

185
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:17,122
I humbly beseech you, proceed
with the affairs of state.

186
00:16:23,098 --> 00:16:28,035
The Turk, with a mighty preparation,
makes for Cyprus.

187
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,532
Othello...

188
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,937
...you must away tonight.

189
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:35,668
The affair cries haste,
and speed must answer it.

190
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:39,279
Most gracious Duke....

191
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:49,854
What would you, Desdemona?

192
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:55,529
That I did love the Moor
to live with him...

193
00:16:56,198 --> 00:16:59,292
...my downright violence
and scorn of fortunes...

194
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:01,594
...may trumpet to the world.

195
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:07,208
My heart is subdued even to
the utmost pleasure of my lord.

196
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:14,281
I saw Othello's visage in his mind...

197
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:17,949
...and to his honors
and his valiant parts...

198
00:17:18,153 --> 00:17:21,486
...did I my soul
and fortunes consecrate.

199
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:26,658
So that, dear lords...

200
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:31,795
...if I be left behind, a moth of peace,
and he go to the war...

201
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,333
...the rites for which I love him
are bereft me.

202
00:17:35,537 --> 00:17:39,029
And l, a heavy interim,
shall support by his dear absence.

203
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:40,902
Let me go with him.

204
00:17:41,343 --> 00:17:43,208
Let her have your voice.

205
00:17:43,412 --> 00:17:45,277
And heaven defend your good souls...

206
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:50,282
...that you think I will your serious
business scant for she is with me.

207
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:55,717
Be it as you shall privately determine.

208
00:17:57,259 --> 00:18:01,525
At 9 in the morning,
here we'll meet again.

209
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,855
Good night to everyone.

210
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,360
And, noble signor...

211
00:18:09,772 --> 00:18:13,731
...if virtue no delighted beauty lack...

212
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:18,675
...your son-in-law
is far more fair than black.

213
00:18:22,818 --> 00:18:27,755
Look to her, Moor,
if thou hast eyes to see.

214
00:18:28,457 --> 00:18:32,723
She has deceived her father
and may thee.

215
00:18:33,962 --> 00:18:36,294
My life upon her faith!

216
00:18:40,002 --> 00:18:43,335
Good lago, my Desdemona
must I leave to thee.

217
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:47,498
Let thy wife attend on her, and bring
them after in the best advantage.

218
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,200
Come, we must obey the time.

219
00:19:01,957 --> 00:19:03,083
lago!

220
00:19:06,695 --> 00:19:08,890
What sayest thou, noble heart?

221
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:14,597
What will I do, thinkest thou?

222
00:19:15,103 --> 00:19:16,832
Why, go to bed and sleep.

223
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,206
I will incontinently drown myself.

224
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,674
If thou dost,
I shall never love thee after.

225
00:19:23,879 --> 00:19:26,143
Why, thou silly gentleman!

226
00:19:26,348 --> 00:19:31,285
It is silliness to live
when to live is a torment.

227
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,917
Desdemona!

228
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,615
Villainous!

229
00:19:39,828 --> 00:19:43,491
I've looked upon the world for
four times seven years...

230
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:47,396
...and I never yet found a man that
knew how to love himself.

231
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:51,471
Ere I would say I would drown myself
for the love of a guinea hen...

232
00:19:51,673 --> 00:19:55,769
-...I'd change my humanity with a baboon.
-What should I do?

233
00:19:56,345 --> 00:19:58,779
I confess it is my shame
to be so fond...

234
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:01,245
...but it is not in my virtue
to amend it.

235
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,883
Virtue? A fig.

236
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:05,417
'Tis in ourselves
that we are thus or thus.

237
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,522
We have reason
to cool our raging motions...

238
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:11,488
...our carnal stings, our
unbitted lusts...

239
00:20:11,693 --> 00:20:14,958
...whereof I take this, which you call
love, to be a sect or scion.

240
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:16,323
It cannot be!

241
00:20:16,531 --> 00:20:20,433
It is merely a lust of the blood
and a permission of the will.

242
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,103
Come, be a man!

243
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,568
Drown thyself?

244
00:20:25,073 --> 00:20:28,065
Drown cats and blind puppies.

245
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:33,112
I have professed me thy friend
and I confess me...

246
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,148
...knit to thy deserving with cables
of perdurable toughness.

247
00:20:36,351 --> 00:20:39,946
I could never
better stead thee than now.

248
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,660
Put money in thy purse.

249
00:20:47,763 --> 00:20:50,926
Follow thou these wars.

250
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:55,066
Disguise thy features with
an usurped beard.

251
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,999
I say, put money in thy purse.

252
00:20:57,205 --> 00:21:00,936
It cannot be that Desdemona should
long continue her love to the Moor.

253
00:21:01,143 --> 00:21:03,111
Put but money in thy purse.

254
00:21:03,312 --> 00:21:06,281
When she's sated with his body,
she'll find the error of her choice.

255
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:09,143
She must have change, she must.

256
00:21:09,818 --> 00:21:11,843
Fill thy purse with money.

257
00:21:12,054 --> 00:21:16,047
If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt
an erring barbarian...

258
00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:19,853
...and a super-subtle Venetian
be not too hard for my wits...

259
00:21:20,062 --> 00:21:21,689
...and all the tribe of hell...

260
00:21:21,897 --> 00:21:24,991
...thou shall enjoy her.

261
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,327
Therefore, put....

262
00:21:28,103 --> 00:21:30,003
"Money in thy purse."

263
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:33,668
A pox on drowning, huh?

264
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,308
'Tis clean out of the way.

265
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:38,206
Seek thou rather to be hanged
in compassing thy joy...

266
00:21:38,413 --> 00:21:40,847
...than to be drowned
and go without her.

267
00:21:45,687 --> 00:21:48,315
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes?

268
00:21:48,523 --> 00:21:51,083
Thou art sure of me.

269
00:21:51,326 --> 00:21:55,854
There are many events in
the womb of time...

270
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,825
...which will be delivered.

271
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,434
Go, provide thy money.

272
00:22:02,871 --> 00:22:05,169
We will have more of this tomorrow.
Adieu.

273
00:22:05,374 --> 00:22:07,308
Where shall we meet in the morning?

274
00:22:07,943 --> 00:22:10,468
-At my lodging.
-All right.

275
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,547
-I'll be with thee betimes.
-Go to, farewell.

276
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:14,909
Does thou hear?

277
00:22:15,117 --> 00:22:16,084
What say thou?

278
00:22:16,284 --> 00:22:18,377
No more of drowning, do you hear?

279
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,611
I am changed.

280
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,319
Go to, farewell.
Put money enough in your purse!

281
00:22:26,528 --> 00:22:28,428
I'll sell all my land.

282
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:34,097
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse.

283
00:22:34,302 --> 00:22:36,998
For I mine own gained knowledge
should profane...

284
00:22:37,205 --> 00:22:40,038
...if I would time
expend with such a snipe...

285
00:22:40,242 --> 00:22:42,733
...but for my sport and profit.

286
00:22:47,883 --> 00:22:52,820
I hate the Moor...

287
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:57,356
...and it is thought abroad that
'twixt my sheets...

288
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:01,928
...he's done my office.

289
00:23:03,098 --> 00:23:04,292
I know not if it be true...

290
00:23:04,499 --> 00:23:08,731
...but l, for mere suspicion
in that kind...

291
00:23:09,504 --> 00:23:14,441
...will do as if for surety.

292
00:23:17,512 --> 00:23:19,412
He holds me well...

293
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:24,680
...the better shall my purpose
work on him.

294
00:23:27,255 --> 00:23:30,053
Cassio's a proper man.

295
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:34,160
Let me see now--
To get his place...

296
00:23:34,362 --> 00:23:39,265
...and to plume up my will
in double knavery....

297
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,260
How?

298
00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:45,470
How?

299
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,942
I have it.

300
00:23:57,752 --> 00:24:00,220
It is engendered.

301
00:24:00,822 --> 00:24:03,382
Hell and night...

302
00:24:03,592 --> 00:24:08,029
...must bring this monstrous birth
to the world's light.

303
00:25:25,307 --> 00:25:28,435
-Hail to thee, lady.
-Thank you, valiant Cassio.

304
00:25:38,753 --> 00:25:42,052
Very good.
Ay, well said, whisper.

305
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,760
With as little a web as this,
will I ensnare...

306
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:50,921
...as great a fly as Cassio.

307
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,784
O, my fair warrior!

308
00:26:15,624 --> 00:26:17,148
My dear Othello!

309
00:26:17,525 --> 00:26:22,121
It gives me wonder great as my content
to see you here before me.

310
00:26:28,536 --> 00:26:30,970
O my soul's joy!

311
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:34,831
I cannot speak enough of this content.
It stops me here.

312
00:26:35,043 --> 00:26:37,603
It is too much of joy.

313
00:26:47,455 --> 00:26:48,979
News, friends:

314
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,159
Our wars are done,
the Turks are drowned!

315
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,493
This desperate storm
hath seen a grievous wrack...

316
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:02,101
...and sufferance
on most part of their fleet.

317
00:27:02,304 --> 00:27:03,794
Worthy Montano.

318
00:27:04,406 --> 00:27:07,307
How does my old acquaintance
of this isle?

319
00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:10,000
Honey, you shall be
well desired in Cyprus.

320
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,645
I have found great love amongst them.

321
00:27:13,515 --> 00:27:16,541
O, you are well tuned now!

322
00:27:16,751 --> 00:27:21,654
But I'll set down the pegs that
make this music, as honest as I am.

323
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:45,027
If thou be'st valiant -- as they say
base men being in love have then...

324
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,142
...a nobility in their nature
more than is native to them -- list me.

325
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:53,072
The lieutenant tonight watches
on the court of guard.

326
00:28:53,615 --> 00:28:55,742
First, I must tell thee this:

327
00:28:56,117 --> 00:28:58,847
Desdemona is directly in love with him.

328
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,849
With Cassio?

329
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,150
Why, 'tis not possible!

330
00:29:03,358 --> 00:29:06,088
Lay thy finger thus,
and let thy soul be instructed.

331
00:29:06,294 --> 00:29:08,159
Mark me. Her eye must be fed.

332
00:29:08,363 --> 00:29:10,593
What delight shall she have
to look on the devil?

333
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,632
Her delicate tenderness has
found itself abused...

334
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:17,999
...begun to heave the gorge,
disrelish and abhor the Moor.

335
00:29:18,206 --> 00:29:21,539
Her nature instructs her to it,
and compels her to some second choice.

336
00:29:21,743 --> 00:29:25,179
I cannot believe that.
She is full of most blessed condition.

337
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,938
Blessed fig 's-end!

338
00:29:27,382 --> 00:29:29,475
The wine she drinks is made of grapes.

339
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:33,651
If she were blessed, she would never
have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding.

340
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:36,423
Didst thou not see her paddle
with his hand?

341
00:29:36,624 --> 00:29:37,989
Didst thou not mark that?

342
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:41,651
-But that was but courtesy.
-Lechery, by this hand...

343
00:29:43,598 --> 00:29:45,793
...an index and obscure prologue...

344
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,525
...to the history
of lust and foul thoughts.

345
00:29:48,736 --> 00:29:52,263
They met so near with their lips
that their breaths embraced together.

346
00:29:52,474 --> 00:29:54,169
Villainous thoughts, Roderigo!

347
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:57,139
When these mutualities
so marshal the way...

348
00:29:57,345 --> 00:29:59,245
...hard at hand comes the master...

349
00:29:59,447 --> 00:30:02,007
...and main exercise,
the incorporate conclusion.

350
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:05,778
But sir, be you ruled by me.
I have brought you from Venice.

351
00:30:08,957 --> 00:30:11,016
Watch you with the guard tonight...

352
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:14,627
...for the command I'll lay it upon you.
I'll not be far from you.

353
00:30:15,163 --> 00:30:19,566
Do you find some occasion
to anger Cassio.

354
00:30:21,636 --> 00:30:22,466
Well....

355
00:30:30,278 --> 00:30:32,303
Welcome, lago.
We must to the watch.

356
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:35,779
Not this hour, lieutenant.
'Tis not yet 1 0 of the clock.

357
00:30:35,984 --> 00:30:38,851
Our general cast us thus early for
the love of his Desdemona...

358
00:30:39,053 --> 00:30:40,816
...who let us not therefore blame.

359
00:30:41,022 --> 00:30:42,683
He hath not yet...

360
00:30:42,891 --> 00:30:46,520
...made wanton the night with her,
and she is sport for Jove.

361
00:30:46,728 --> 00:30:48,389
She's a most exquisite lady.

362
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:51,656
And I'll warrant her, full of game.

363
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:53,697
She is indeed perfection.

364
00:30:53,902 --> 00:30:55,028
Well...

365
00:30:55,236 --> 00:30:56,794
...happiness to their sheets!

366
00:30:57,005 --> 00:30:58,768
Come, I have a stoop of wine...

367
00:30:58,973 --> 00:31:01,134
...and here without are
a brace of Cyprus gallants...

368
00:31:01,342 --> 00:31:03,435
...that would have a measure to
the health of black Othello.

369
00:31:03,645 --> 00:31:05,112
Not tonight, good lago.

370
00:31:05,313 --> 00:31:07,372
I have very poor and unhappy
brains for drinking.

371
00:31:07,582 --> 00:31:09,914
I could well wish courtesy
would invent...

372
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,313
...some other custom of entertainment.

373
00:31:14,022 --> 00:31:16,183
They are our friends.

374
00:31:17,425 --> 00:31:19,325
But one cup?
I'll drink for you.

375
00:31:19,527 --> 00:31:23,122
I have drunk a cup tonight already and
dare not task my weakness with anymore.

376
00:31:23,331 --> 00:31:25,925
What, man!
'Tis a night of revels.

377
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,295
The gallants desire it.

378
00:31:30,772 --> 00:31:32,171
Where are they?

379
00:31:36,077 --> 00:31:39,069
If I can fasten
but one cup upon him....

380
00:32:15,316 --> 00:32:17,147
The purchase made...

381
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,654
...the fruits are to ensue...

382
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:25,424
...that profit's yet to come
between me and you.

383
00:33:47,175 --> 00:33:49,405
Is your Englishman so expert
in his drinking?

384
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,579
Why, he drinks you with facility,
your Dane dead drunk.

385
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,907
He sweats not to overthrow your Almain.

386
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:58,984
And he gives your Hollander a vomit
ere the next pottle can be filled.

387
00:33:59,187 --> 00:34:00,586
Health to our general!

388
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:03,018
I am for it, lieutenant...

389
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:05,882
...and I'll do you justice.

390
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,071
Sweet England!

391
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,210
Save you, friend Cassio.

392
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,888
Well, how is it with you, most fair...?

393
00:34:38,593 --> 00:34:39,753
Bianca.

394
00:34:42,096 --> 00:34:44,963
Let be gallantly!

395
00:34:48,236 --> 00:34:52,036
He was a wight of high renown

396
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,898
And thou art but of low degree

397
00:34:57,411 --> 00:35:01,939
'Tis pride that pulls the country down

398
00:35:02,884 --> 00:35:06,183
Then take thine auld cloak...

399
00:35:06,387 --> 00:35:08,981
...about thee

400
00:35:14,228 --> 00:35:16,093
Let' s have no more of this.

401
00:35:16,297 --> 00:35:17,855
Let' s to our affairs.

402
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,325
God forgive us our sins.

403
00:35:21,803 --> 00:35:24,897
Gentlemen, let's look to our business.

404
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:29,672
Do not think, gentlemen,
that I am drunk.

405
00:35:30,511 --> 00:35:32,741
This is my ensign.

406
00:35:32,947 --> 00:35:34,710
This is my right hand.

407
00:35:35,616 --> 00:35:37,174
This is my left hand.

408
00:35:38,586 --> 00:35:40,611
I am not drunk now.

409
00:35:41,823 --> 00:35:43,848
I can stand well enough...

410
00:35:44,091 --> 00:35:45,558
...and I speak well enough.

411
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,455
-Excellent well.
-Why, very well.

412
00:35:49,831 --> 00:35:52,129
You must not think then
that I am drunk.

413
00:35:56,704 --> 00:35:59,537
To the platform, masters.
Come, let's set the watch.

414
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,038
You see this fellow that is gone before?

415
00:36:02,677 --> 00:36:06,773
He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar
and give direction.

416
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,242
And do but see his vice.

417
00:36:09,483 --> 00:36:11,383
But is he often thus?

418
00:36:12,053 --> 00:36:14,988
'Tis evermore the prologue
to his sleep.

419
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:21,361
-What's the matter, lieutenant?
-A knave teach me my duty!

420
00:36:21,562 --> 00:36:23,655
I'll beat the knave
into a twiggen bottle.

421
00:36:23,865 --> 00:36:26,493
-Beat me!
-Dost thou prate, rogue?

422
00:36:27,301 --> 00:36:28,928
Nay, good lieutenant.

423
00:36:29,136 --> 00:36:32,902
I pray you, sir, hold your hand.

424
00:36:33,641 --> 00:36:37,372
Let me go, sir, or I'll knock you
over the mazzard.

425
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,811
Come, come...

426
00:36:41,015 --> 00:36:42,482
...you're drunk.

427
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,648
Drunk?

428
00:36:53,027 --> 00:36:54,688
Nay, good lieutenant.

429
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,590
God's will, gentlemen!

430
00:37:05,206 --> 00:37:07,572
Good lieutenant, hold!

431
00:37:07,775 --> 00:37:09,743
Mutiny!

432
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,903
Mutiny!

433
00:37:21,088 --> 00:37:22,248
Help, ho! Lieutenant!

434
00:37:30,898 --> 00:37:32,331
God's will, lieutenant.
Hold!

435
00:37:32,533 --> 00:37:35,093
Hold, for your lives!

436
00:37:35,303 --> 00:37:36,429
Hold, for shame!

437
00:37:36,637 --> 00:37:38,502
What's the matter here? !

438
00:37:38,706 --> 00:37:40,571
Are we turned Turks? !

439
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:44,800
For Christian shame,
put by this barbarous brawl.

440
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:48,214
He who stirs next
to carve for his own rage...

441
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,781
...holds his soul light.

442
00:37:49,984 --> 00:37:52,817
He dies upon his motion.

443
00:37:54,922 --> 00:37:57,413
What is the matter, masters?

444
00:37:58,492 --> 00:37:59,652
Michael...

445
00:37:59,894 --> 00:38:02,362
...how comes it you are thus forgot?

446
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,159
I pray you, pardon me, sir!

447
00:38:07,902 --> 00:38:09,529
I cannot speak.

448
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,467
Worthy Montano...

449
00:38:16,444 --> 00:38:19,675
...what is the matter that
you unlace your reputation thus...

450
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,145
...and spend your rich opinion for
the name of a night-brawler?

451
00:38:23,351 --> 00:38:28,152
-Give me answer to it.
-Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger.

452
00:38:28,356 --> 00:38:31,450
Your officer, lago, can inform you,
while I spare speech...

453
00:38:31,659 --> 00:38:33,991
...of all that I do know.

454
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:47,334
Now, by heaven, my blood begins
my safer guides to rule.

455
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:51,602
On thy love I charge thee, lago.
Who began it?

456
00:38:51,812 --> 00:38:54,076
If partially affined or
leagued in office...

457
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:57,478
...thou dost deliver more
or less than truth...

458
00:38:57,685 --> 00:38:59,585
...thou art no soldier.

459
00:38:59,787 --> 00:39:02,722
T ouch me not so near!
I had rather cut this tongue...

460
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:05,187
...than it should do offense
to Michael Cassio.

461
00:39:08,295 --> 00:39:10,593
Yet to speak the truth
shall nothing wrong him.

462
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:12,265
This it is, general:

463
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:15,768
Montano and myself being in speech,
comes a fellow crying for help...

464
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:19,838
...and Cassio following him with
determined sword to execute upon him.

465
00:39:20,141 --> 00:39:23,008
Sir, this gentleman steps in
to Cassio....

466
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:36,383
--but more of this matter
can I not report.

467
00:39:41,429 --> 00:39:45,229
But men are men.
The best sometime forget.

468
00:39:45,433 --> 00:39:47,526
Though Cassio did
some little wrong to him...

469
00:39:47,735 --> 00:39:50,431
...as men in rage strike those
that wish them best...

470
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,570
...yet surely Cassio--

471
00:39:51,772 --> 00:39:56,232
I know, lago, thy honesty and love
doth mince this matter...

472
00:39:56,444 --> 00:39:59,379
...making it light to Cassio.

473
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:19,691
Cassio...

474
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:26,966
...he that you hurt
is of great fame in Cyprus...

475
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:30,072
...and great affinity.

476
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,778
I love thee...

477
00:40:34,782 --> 00:40:37,273
...but nevermore be officer of mine.

478
00:40:37,651 --> 00:40:39,209
What is the matter, dear?

479
00:40:40,454 --> 00:40:42,388
Look, if my gentle love
be not raised up.

480
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,888
I'll make thee an example.

481
00:40:46,594 --> 00:40:48,789
All's well now, sweeting.
Come away to bed.

482
00:40:48,996 --> 00:40:50,725
Look with care about the town...

483
00:40:50,931 --> 00:40:53,627
...and silence those
whom this vile brawl distracted.

484
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:55,802
Come, sweet Desdemona.

485
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,946
-Are you hurt, lieutenant?
-Ay, past all surgery.

486
00:41:12,153 --> 00:41:15,316
-Marry, God forbid!
-I have lost my reputation.

487
00:41:15,956 --> 00:41:18,550
I have lost the immortal
part of myself...

488
00:41:18,759 --> 00:41:21,319
...and what remains is bestial.

489
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:23,724
My reputation, lago!

490
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:24,829
My reputation!

491
00:41:25,032 --> 00:41:26,966
I thought you'd received some wound.

492
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:29,932
There's more offense in that
than in reputation.

493
00:41:32,173 --> 00:41:35,506
What, man! There are ways
to recover the general again.

494
00:41:35,709 --> 00:41:37,233
You are but now cast in his mood...

495
00:41:37,444 --> 00:41:39,639
...a punishment more in policy
than in malice.

496
00:41:39,847 --> 00:41:41,439
Sue to him again, and he's yours.

497
00:41:41,649 --> 00:41:43,276
I would rather sue to be despised...

498
00:41:43,484 --> 00:41:45,315
...than to deceive
so good a commander...

499
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:49,387
...with so slight, so drunken and
so indiscreet an officer.

500
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,921
He that you followed...

501
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:53,559
-...what had he done to you?
-I know not.

502
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:54,591
Is it possible?

503
00:41:54,795 --> 00:41:55,625
Drunk!

504
00:41:55,829 --> 00:41:58,559
Wine is a good
familiar creature, if it be well used.

505
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,132
Exclaim no more against it.

506
00:42:01,335 --> 00:42:04,532
And good lieutenant...

507
00:42:04,972 --> 00:42:08,032
...l think you think I love you.

508
00:42:10,044 --> 00:42:11,443
I have well approved it, sir.

509
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,706
I'll tell you what you shall do.

510
00:42:15,149 --> 00:42:18,118
Our general's wife is now the general.

511
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,615
Confess yourself freely to Desdemona.

512
00:42:21,822 --> 00:42:25,155
lmportune her. She'll help
to put you in your place again.

513
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:28,226
This broken joint
between you and her husband...

514
00:42:28,429 --> 00:42:30,192
...entreat her to splinter.

515
00:42:30,397 --> 00:42:33,764
And my fortunes
against any lay worth naming...

516
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:38,371
...this crack of your love shall
grow stronger than it was before.

517
00:42:40,541 --> 00:42:41,701
You advise me well.

518
00:42:42,176 --> 00:42:45,737
I protest, in the sincerity of love
and honest kindness.

519
00:42:45,946 --> 00:42:47,811
I think it freely.

520
00:42:54,188 --> 00:42:55,985
Good night, lieutenant.

521
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:58,215
I must to the watch.

522
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:00,959
Good night, honest lago.

523
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,997
How am I then a villain...

524
00:43:08,202 --> 00:43:10,727
...when this advice is free I give
and honest...

525
00:43:10,938 --> 00:43:14,874
...probal to thinking, and indeed
the course to win the Moor again?

526
00:43:15,075 --> 00:43:19,478
His soul is so enfettered
to Desdemona's love...

527
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,275
...that she may make, unmake,
do what she list...

528
00:43:23,484 --> 00:43:27,511
...even as her appetite shall
play the god with his weak function.

529
00:43:27,721 --> 00:43:30,121
How am I then a villain
to counsel Cassio...

530
00:43:30,324 --> 00:43:33,350
...to this parallel course,
directed to his good?

531
00:43:34,161 --> 00:43:36,823
Divinity of hell!

532
00:43:37,665 --> 00:43:41,692
When devils will the blackest sins
put on, they do suggest at first...

533
00:43:41,902 --> 00:43:44,234
...with heavenly shows, as I do now.

534
00:43:44,438 --> 00:43:49,068
For whiles this honest fool plies
Desdemona to repair his fortunes...

535
00:43:49,276 --> 00:43:52,439
...and she for him
pleads strongly to the Moor...

536
00:43:52,646 --> 00:43:55,114
...I'll pour this pestilence
into his ear...

537
00:43:55,316 --> 00:43:59,150
...that she repeals him for
her body's lust...

538
00:43:59,353 --> 00:44:02,379
...and by how much she strives
to do him good...

539
00:44:02,589 --> 00:44:06,992
...she shall undo her credit
with the Moor.

540
00:44:10,664 --> 00:44:13,758
So will I turn her virtue...

541
00:44:18,172 --> 00:44:19,969
...into pitch.

542
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,437
And out of her own goodness...

543
00:44:23,644 --> 00:44:25,669
...make the net...

544
00:44:25,879 --> 00:44:27,813
...that shall...

545
00:44:28,015 --> 00:44:29,880
...enmesh them all.

546
00:44:34,488 --> 00:44:36,353
How now, Roderigo?

547
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:39,586
I do follow here in the chase...

548
00:44:39,827 --> 00:44:42,591
...not like a hound that hunts...

549
00:44:42,796 --> 00:44:45,594
...but one that fills up the cry.

550
00:44:46,066 --> 00:44:48,694
My money is almost spent.

551
00:44:48,902 --> 00:44:52,838
I have been tonight
exceedingly well-cudgeled.

552
00:44:53,741 --> 00:44:56,801
And I think the issue will be...

553
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:00,241
...that I shall have
so much experience for my pains.

554
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:01,812
And so...

555
00:45:02,549 --> 00:45:06,417
...with no money at all and
a little more wit...

556
00:45:07,755 --> 00:45:10,189
...return again to Venice.

557
00:45:11,492 --> 00:45:14,757
How poor are they
that have not patience.

558
00:45:15,763 --> 00:45:19,392
What wound did ever heal
but by degrees?

559
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,492
Thou knowest we work by wit...

560
00:45:22,703 --> 00:45:24,568
...and not by witchcraft.

561
00:45:24,772 --> 00:45:28,037
And wit depends on dilatory time.

562
00:45:28,842 --> 00:45:30,503
Does it not go well?

563
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,637
Cassio hath beaten thee.

564
00:45:37,384 --> 00:45:40,820
And thou, by that small hurt...

565
00:45:41,021 --> 00:45:44,149
...hath cashiered Cassio.

566
00:45:48,228 --> 00:45:50,128
Content thyself awhile.

567
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:03,340
By the mass, 'tis morning.

568
00:46:03,777 --> 00:46:07,144
Pleasure and action
make the hours seem short.

569
00:46:07,748 --> 00:46:09,272
Retire thee awhile.

570
00:46:12,286 --> 00:46:13,947
Away, I say.

571
00:46:14,455 --> 00:46:16,753
Thou shalt know more hereafter.

572
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,254
Nay, get thee gone.

573
00:46:38,011 --> 00:46:39,273
Bounteous madam...

574
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,471
...whatever shall become of
Michael Cassio?

575
00:46:41,682 --> 00:46:45,311
-He's never anything but your servant.
-I know it.

576
00:46:45,752 --> 00:46:47,014
I thank you.

577
00:46:48,355 --> 00:46:49,652
Madam, here comes my lord.

578
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,927
-I like not that.
-What dost thou say?

579
00:46:56,497 --> 00:46:57,464
Nothing, my lord.

580
00:46:57,831 --> 00:47:00,527
-Madam, I take my leave.
-Farewell.

581
00:47:03,337 --> 00:47:05,362
Was not that Cassio
parted from my wife?

582
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:06,504
Cassio, my lord.

583
00:47:08,842 --> 00:47:10,673
How now, my lord?

584
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,713
I have been talking with
a suitor here...

585
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,973
...a man that languishes in
your displeasure.

586
00:47:16,183 --> 00:47:17,673
Who is it you mean?

587
00:47:17,885 --> 00:47:19,910
Why, your lieutenant, Cassio.

588
00:47:20,387 --> 00:47:23,015
Good my lord, if he be not one
that truly loves you...

589
00:47:23,223 --> 00:47:25,885
...l have no judgment in an honest face.

590
00:47:41,041 --> 00:47:43,509
Excellent wretch!

591
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:47,876
Perdition catch my soul,
but I do love thee!

592
00:47:50,183 --> 00:47:52,378
And when I love thee not...

593
00:47:53,353 --> 00:47:55,378
...chaos is come again.

594
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:59,982
-My noble lord--
-What dost thou say, lago?

595
00:48:00,193 --> 00:48:03,594
Did Cassio, when you wooed
my lady, know of your love?

596
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:05,628
He did, from first to last.

597
00:48:10,404 --> 00:48:12,031
Why dost thou ask?

598
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:15,572
But for a satisfaction of my thought--
No further harm.

599
00:48:20,781 --> 00:48:23,181
Why of thy thought, lago?

600
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:25,918
I did not think he had been
acquainted with her.

601
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:27,484
O, yes.

602
00:48:28,355 --> 00:48:29,982
And went between us very oft.

603
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:31,953
-lndeed!
-lndeed?

604
00:48:32,292 --> 00:48:34,021
Ay, indeed.

605
00:48:35,262 --> 00:48:37,662
Discernest thou aught in that?
Is he not honest?

606
00:48:37,864 --> 00:48:39,161
Honest, my lord?

607
00:48:39,633 --> 00:48:41,123
Honest? Ay, honest.

608
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,196
My lord, for aught I know.

609
00:48:43,403 --> 00:48:45,268
-What dost thou think?
-Think, my lord?

610
00:48:45,472 --> 00:48:48,134
"Think, my lord" !
By heaven, he echoes me.

611
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,934
Thou dost mean something.

612
00:48:50,143 --> 00:48:53,112
If thou dost love me,
show me thy thought.

613
00:48:54,247 --> 00:48:57,705
-My lord, you know I love you.
-I think thou dost.

614
00:48:58,151 --> 00:49:00,551
And for I know
thou art full of love...

615
00:49:00,754 --> 00:49:02,153
...and honesty...

616
00:49:02,656 --> 00:49:05,420
...and weighest thy words
before thou givest them breath.

617
00:49:05,626 --> 00:49:08,322
Therefore, these stops of thine
fright me the more.

618
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:11,361
For Cassio, I dare be sworn
I think that he is honest.

619
00:49:11,965 --> 00:49:13,193
I think so too.

620
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,833
Men should be what they seem.

621
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,469
Or those that be not,
would they might seem none.

622
00:49:17,671 --> 00:49:19,434
Certain, men should be
what they seem.

623
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,108
Why then, I think Cassio's
an honest man.

624
00:49:22,309 --> 00:49:24,072
Nay, yet there's more in this!

625
00:49:24,277 --> 00:49:26,541
I prithee, speak to me as to
thy thinkings.

626
00:49:26,747 --> 00:49:30,308
As thou dost ruminate, give thy
worst of thoughts the worst of words.

627
00:49:30,517 --> 00:49:32,382
I do beseech you--

628
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,818
Though I perchance am

vicious in my guess...

629
00:49:36,023 --> 00:49:39,982
...as I confess, it is my
nature's plague to spy into abuses...

630
00:49:40,193 --> 00:49:42,423
...and oft my jealousy...

631
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,097
...shapes faults that are not.

632
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:49,802
I entreat you then, it were not for
your quiet nor your good...

633
00:49:50,003 --> 00:49:54,940
...nor for my manhood, honesty and
wisdom to let you know my thoughts.

634
00:49:55,175 --> 00:49:56,574
What dost thou mean?

635
00:49:57,611 --> 00:50:00,739
Good name in man and woman,
dear my lord...

636
00:50:00,947 --> 00:50:04,314
...is the immediate jewel
of their souls.

637
00:50:04,518 --> 00:50:07,043
Who steals my purse,
steals trash.

638
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:10,348
'Tis something, nothing.
'Twas mine, 'tis his...

639
00:50:10,557 --> 00:50:11,751
...has been slave to thousands.

640
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:15,052
But he that filches from me
my good name...

641
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,730
...robs me of that
which not enriches him...

642
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:20,525
...and makes me poor indeed.

643
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:25,731
By heaven, I'll know thy thought.

644
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:27,736
You cannot, if my heart
were in your hand.

645
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:30,808
Nor shall not,
while 'tis in my custody.

646
00:50:32,479 --> 00:50:35,312
O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!

647
00:50:35,582 --> 00:50:39,814
'Tis the green-eyed monster
that doth mock the meat it feeds on.

648
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:41,512
Why?

649
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:45,986
Why is this?

650
00:50:47,394 --> 00:50:50,852
Thinkest thou I'd make
a life of jealousy...

651
00:50:51,064 --> 00:50:55,228
...to follow still the changes of
the moon with fresh suspicions? No!

652
00:50:56,269 --> 00:50:58,863
T o be once in doubt
is once to be resolved.

653
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,167
Nor from mine own weak merits
shall I draw...

654
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:07,108
...the smallest fear or doubt of her
revolt, for she had eyes and chose me.

655
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,303
No, lago...

656
00:51:09,382 --> 00:51:13,284
...I'll see before I doubt.
When I doubt, prove.

657
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,512
And on the proof,
there is no more but this:

658
00:51:15,722 --> 00:51:17,883
Away at once with love or jealousy.

659
00:51:18,091 --> 00:51:19,718
I am glad, for now I have reason...

660
00:51:19,926 --> 00:51:23,020
...to show the love and duty
that I bear you with franker spirit.

661
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:27,189
Therefore, as I am bound,
receive it from me.

662
00:51:28,101 --> 00:51:30,069
I speak not yet of proof.

663
00:51:36,076 --> 00:51:37,475
Look to your wife.

664
00:51:40,147 --> 00:51:43,412
Observe her well with Cassio.

665
00:51:44,484 --> 00:51:46,008
Look to it.

666
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,381
I know our country disposition well.

667
00:51:49,589 --> 00:51:52,285
In Venice, they do
let heaven see the pranks...

668
00:51:52,492 --> 00:51:54,483
...they dare not show their husbands.

669
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:57,185
Their best conscience
is not to leave it undone...

670
00:51:57,397 --> 00:51:59,365
...but keep it unknown.

671
00:52:06,006 --> 00:52:08,474
-Dost thou say so?
-She did deceive her father.

672
00:52:08,675 --> 00:52:11,337
And when she seemed to fear your looks,
she loved them most.

673
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:14,105
-And so she did.
-Why, go to then.

674
00:52:19,452 --> 00:52:21,147
But I am much to blame.

675
00:52:23,323 --> 00:52:27,316
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
for too much loving you.

676
00:52:27,527 --> 00:52:29,518
I am bound to thee forever.

677
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,491
I see this hath dashed your spirits.

678
00:52:34,701 --> 00:52:37,295
-Not a jot, not a jot.
-ln faith, I fear it has.

679
00:52:37,504 --> 00:52:39,995
I hope you consider what is spoke
comes from my love.

680
00:52:40,207 --> 00:52:42,141
But I do see you're moved.

681
00:52:42,342 --> 00:52:45,709
I am to pray you not to strain
my speech to grosser issues...

682
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:48,039
...nor to larger reach than
to suspicion.

683
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,875
Should you do so, my lord...

684
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:53,018
...my speech should fall into vile
success as my thoughts aimed not at.

685
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,814
Cassio's my worthy friend--
My lord, you're moved.

686
00:52:56,022 --> 00:52:57,353
No, not much moved!

687
00:52:57,557 --> 00:52:59,422
I do not think but Desdemona's honest.

688
00:52:59,626 --> 00:53:02,686
Long live she so.
And long live you to think so.

689
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,888
And yet, how nature erring from itself--

690
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,829
Ay, there's the point!

691
00:53:09,035 --> 00:53:11,401
As to be bold not to enter
into a marriage...

692
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:14,199
...of her own clime, complexion
and degree...

693
00:53:14,407 --> 00:53:18,343
...whereto we see in all things
nature tends--

694
00:53:18,712 --> 00:53:21,272
One may smell in such
a will most rank...

695
00:53:21,481 --> 00:53:25,383
...foul disproportion,
thoughts unnatural.

696
00:53:38,164 --> 00:53:42,931
But pardon me. I do not in position
distinctly speak of her.

697
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:47,698
Though I may fear, her will,
recoiling to her better judgment...

698
00:53:47,908 --> 00:53:51,139
...may fall to match you with
her country forms...

699
00:53:51,344 --> 00:53:53,335
...and happily repent.

700
00:53:55,015 --> 00:53:56,642
Farewell, farewell.

701
00:53:56,850 --> 00:54:00,308
If more thou dost perceive,
let me know more.

702
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,219
Leave me, lago.

703
00:54:02,422 --> 00:54:04,447
My lord, I take my leave.

704
00:54:10,597 --> 00:54:12,497
Why did I marry?

705
00:54:14,034 --> 00:54:16,525
My lord, I would
I might entreat your honor...

706
00:54:16,736 --> 00:54:19,000
...to scan this thing no farther.

707
00:54:19,205 --> 00:54:20,194
Leave it to time.

708
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:23,241
Let me be thought too busy
in my fears--

709
00:54:23,443 --> 00:54:26,469
--as worthy cause
I have to fear I am--

710
00:54:26,947 --> 00:54:28,938
--and hold her free.

711
00:54:29,316 --> 00:54:30,749
Fear not my government.

712
00:54:38,258 --> 00:54:42,319
That we can call
these delicate creatures ours...

713
00:54:42,762 --> 00:54:45,196
...and not their appetites!
