1
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:52,442
可以断定，是塞浦路斯岛


2
00:02:54,154 --> 00:02:59,091
但由谁来领导我们的舰队同土耳其人作战


3
00:03:00,728 --> 00:03:01,990
奥瑟罗


4
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:05,292
没有第二个人有像他那样的才能


5
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:10,197
可以担当这一个重任


6
00:03:36,797 --> 00:03:39,288
你太不够朋友了，伊阿古

7
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,560
我把我的钱袋让你随便掏


8
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,601
你却早知道了这一切


9
00:03:44,805 --> 00:03:48,070
我凭天理良心说，论身价


10
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:53,212
我不该低于这个位置了，偏是他，迈克尔. 凯西奥

11
00:03:53,414 --> 00:03:58,044
一个佛罗伦萨人，当上了副将


12
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:01,947
我呢，我的煊赫战功，奥瑟罗亲眼见过


13
00:04:02,156 --> 00:04:06,616
天晓得，活该当摩尔人船上的旗官


14
00:04:06,827 --> 00:04:10,024
天在上，我宁愿做绞死他的刽子手
15
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,963
Why, there's no remedy.
'Tis the curse of service.

16
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:20,101
I would not follow him then.

17
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:23,208
O, sir, content you.

18
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:27,176
I follow him to serve my turn upon him.

19
00:04:27,381 --> 00:04:32,318
We cannot all be masters, nor all masters cannot be truly followed.

20
00:04:32,853 --> 00:04:34,616
You shall mark...

21
00:04:34,888 --> 00:04:39,382
...heaven is my judge,not I for love and duty...

22
00:04:39,593 --> 00:04:43,689
...but seeming so for my peculiar end.

23
00:04:43,897 --> 00:04:47,799
I am not what I am.

24
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,907
What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe, if he can carry it thus.

25
00:04:56,743 --> 00:04:59,507
Call up her father.

26
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:16,091
Awake! Thieves! Signor!

27
00:05:16,296 --> 00:05:19,891
Thieves! Look to your house,your daughter and your bags!

28
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:21,998
Signor Brabantio!Ho!

29
00:05:22,703 --> 00:05:23,601
-Awake!
-Sir!

30
00:05:23,804 --> 00:05:27,331
Thieves! Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!

31
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:30,203
Thieves! Thieves!

32
00:05:31,278 --> 00:05:33,712
What is the reason of this terrible summons?

33
00:05:33,914 --> 00:05:36,007
What is the matter here?

34
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,444
Signor...

35
00:05:42,022 --> 00:05:44,286
...is all your family within?

36
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:47,016
I know you, Roderigo...

37
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:50,958
...and have charged thee not to haunt about my doors.

38
00:05:51,164 --> 00:05:53,689
In honest plainness,thou has heard me say...

39
00:05:53,901 --> 00:05:55,994
...my daughter is not for thee.

40
00:05:56,203 --> 00:05:58,330
Are your doors locked?

41
00:05:59,306 --> 00:06:01,536
Why? Wherefore ask you this?

42
00:06:01,742 --> 00:06:04,677
Even now, now, very now...

43
00:06:04,878 --> 00:06:08,644
...an old black ram is tupping your white ewe.

44
00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:10,942
What profane wretch art thou?

45
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:12,812
I am one that comes to tell you...

46
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,114
...your daughter and the Moor are making the beast with two backs.

47
00:06:16,323 --> 00:06:17,381
Thou art a villain.

48
00:06:17,591 --> 00:06:19,786
You are a senator.

49
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:23,255
This thou shalt answer, Roderigo.

50
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:24,555
Ay, sir!

51
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:26,690
I will answer anything.

52
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,767
But I beseech you,straight satisfy yourself:

53
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:33,399
If she be in her chamber or your house...

54
00:06:33,607 --> 00:06:38,101
...let loose on me the justice of the state for thus deluding you.

55
00:06:40,681 --> 00:06:42,546
Strike on the tinder, ho!

56
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:45,877
Give me a taper!Call up all my people!

57
00:06:48,188 --> 00:06:51,453
This accident is not unlike my dream.

58
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:54,192
Belief of it oppresses me already.

59
00:06:55,028 --> 00:06:56,825
Light, I say!

60
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,429
Light!

61
00:07:00,334 --> 00:07:02,495
Get weapons, ho!

62
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:06,768
Farewell, for I must leave you.

63
00:07:24,825 --> 00:07:27,851
The goodness of the night upon you, friends.

64
00:07:30,364 --> 00:07:33,595
I pray you, sir,are you fast married?

65
00:07:36,003 --> 00:07:39,029
Sir, you've been hotly called for.

66
00:07:40,707 --> 00:07:41,799
Have with you.

67
00:07:57,157 --> 00:07:58,784
-Halt!
-You!

68
00:08:01,028 --> 00:08:04,964
lKeep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.

69
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:09,330
O, thou foul thief!

70
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:11,731
Where hast thou stowed my daughter?

71
00:08:11,938 --> 00:08:14,566
Damned as thou art,thou hast enchanted her...

72
00:08:14,775 --> 00:08:19,644
...to run from her garden to the sooty bosom of such a thing as thou.

73
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:26,948
Lay hold upon him.

74
00:08:27,154 --> 00:08:28,917
Hold your hands...

75
00:08:29,256 --> 00:08:31,747
...both you of my inclining and the rest.

76
00:08:33,593 --> 00:08:38,428
Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it without a prompter.

77
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,867
Good signor...

78
00:08:42,803 --> 00:08:45,033
...where will you that I go to answer this, your charge?

79
00:08:45,238 --> 00:08:46,603
To prison...

80
00:08:46,807 --> 00:08:50,140
...till fit time of law and course of direct session call thee to answer.

81
00:08:50,343 --> 00:08:52,368
What if I do obey?

82
00:08:52,612 --> 00:08:55,172
How may the Duke be therewith satisfied...

83
00:08:55,382 --> 00:08:59,842
...whose messengers are here about my side to bring me to him?

84
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,847
'Tis true,most worthy signor.

85
00:09:02,055 --> 00:09:05,149
The Duke's in council, and your noble self, surely, is sent for.

86
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:08,486
How? The Duke in council?In this time of night?

87
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:10,693
Bring him away.

88
00:09:32,652 --> 00:09:34,279
Valiant Othello...

89
00:09:34,554 --> 00:09:38,388
...we must straight employ you against the general Turkish foe.

90
00:09:38,592 --> 00:09:41,425
Welcome, gentle signor.

91
00:09:41,628 --> 00:09:44,529
We lacked your counseland your help tonight.

92
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:46,221
So did I yours.

93
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,392
Good Your Grace, pardon me.

94
00:09:48,602 --> 00:09:51,127
Neither my place,nor aught I heard of business...

95
00:09:51,338 --> 00:09:53,465
...has raised me from my bed.

96
00:09:54,374 --> 00:09:55,671
My daughter!

97
00:09:57,144 --> 00:09:58,236
O, my daughter!

98
00:09:58,445 --> 00:09:59,377
Dead?

99
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,577
She is abused,stolen from me and corrupted.

100
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:08,987
For nature so preposterously to err,sans witchcraft could not.

101
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,589
Whoever he be that in this foul proceeding...

102
00:10:13,794 --> 00:10:18,731
...hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself, and you of her...

103
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:22,694
...the bloody book of law you shall yourself read...

104
00:10:22,903 --> 00:10:27,033
...in the bitter letter after your own sense.

105
00:10:27,507 --> 00:10:31,773
Humbly, I thank Your Grace.

106
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,282
Here is the man.

107
00:10:48,028 --> 00:10:49,290
Othello?

108
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:52,089
What in your own part can you say to this?

109
00:10:52,299 --> 00:10:54,790
Nothing, but this is so.

110
00:11:01,308 --> 00:11:06,245
Most potent, grave and reverend signors...

111
00:11:07,347 --> 00:11:10,680
...my very noble and approved good masters...

112
00:11:11,852 --> 00:11:14,912
...that I have taken away this old man's daughter...

113
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:17,988
...'tis most true.True, I have married her.

114
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,754
The very head and front of my offending hath this extent, no more.

115
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:25,455
Rude am I in my speech...

116
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:30,432
...and little blessed with the soft phrase of peace.

117
00:11:30,637 --> 00:11:33,765
For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith...

118
00:11:33,974 --> 00:11:35,942
...till now some nine moons wasted...

119
00:11:36,142 --> 00:11:39,305
...they have used their dearest action in the tented field.

120
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:42,413
And little of this great world ，can I speak...

121
00:11:42,616 --> 00:11:46,052
...more than pertains to feats of broil and battle.

122
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:49,083
Therefore, little shall l grace my cause...

123
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:53,487
...in speaking of myself.Yet, by your gracious patience...

124
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:57,925
...l will a round,unvarnished tale deliver...

125
00:11:58,198 --> 00:12:00,564
...of my whole course of love:

126
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:04,134
What drugs, what charms...

127
00:12:04,337 --> 00:12:08,637
...what conjuration and what mighty magic--

128
00:12:08,842 --> 00:12:13,575
--for such proceedings am l charged withal -- I won his daughter.

129
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,577
A maiden never bold...

130
00:12:15,782 --> 00:12:19,377
...of spirit so still and quiet that her motion blushed at herself...

131
00:12:19,586 --> 00:12:22,054
...and she, in spite of nature,to fall in love...

132
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:24,155
...with what she feared to look on!

133
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:26,348
I do beseech you, send for the lady...

134
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:28,789
...and let her speak of me before her father.

135
00:12:28,995 --> 00:12:31,463
If you do find me foul in her report...

136
00:12:31,665 --> 00:12:35,431
...the trust, the office I do hold of you, not only take away...

137
00:12:35,635 --> 00:12:39,196
...but let your sentence even fall upon my life.

138
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:44,076
Fetch Desdemona.

139
00:12:54,688 --> 00:12:57,213
Her father loved me...

140
00:12:57,557 --> 00:12:59,422
...oft invited me...

141
00:12:59,893 --> 00:13:03,556
...still questioned me the story of my life from year to year...

142
00:13:03,763 --> 00:13:08,132
...the battles, sieges, fortunes that I have passed.

143
00:13:08,335 --> 00:13:10,599
Even from my boyish days...

144
00:13:10,804 --> 00:13:12,567
...to the moment he bade me tell it.

145
00:13:12,772 --> 00:13:15,104
Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances...

146
00:13:15,308 --> 00:13:17,708
...of moving accidents by flood and field...

147
00:13:17,911 --> 00:13:21,210
...hair-breadth escapes in the imminent deadly breach...

148
00:13:21,414 --> 00:13:24,440
...of being taken by the insolent foe...

149
00:13:24,651 --> 00:13:27,176
...and sold to slavery.

150
00:13:27,387 --> 00:13:29,947
And of the cannibals that each other eat...

151
00:13:30,156 --> 00:13:31,919
... the Anthropophagi...

152
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:35,526
...and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders.

153
00:13:35,729 --> 00:13:39,096
These things to hear would Desdemona seriously incline.

154
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:44,236
And with a greedy ear devour up my discourse...

155
00:13:44,571 --> 00:13:46,436
... which I observing...

156
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,001
... took once a pliant hour...

157
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:52,474
...and found means to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart...

158
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:55,307
... which I would all my pilgrimage dilate.

159
00:13:55,648 --> 00:13:58,674
She gave me for my pains...

160
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,054
...a world of sighs.

161
00:14:02,255 --> 00:14:05,554
She swore, in faith, 'twas strange...

162
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,058
... 'twas passing strange,'twas pitiful...

163
00:14:09,262 --> 00:14:11,321
... 'twas wondrous pitiful.

164
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:17,531
She loved me for the dangers I had passed...

165
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:20,706
...and I loved her that she did pity them.

166
00:14:22,075 --> 00:14:25,408
This only is the witchcraft I have used.

167
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:41,157
Come hither, gentle mistress.

168
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:47,998
Do you perceive in all this company，where most you owe obedience?

169
00:14:50,737 --> 00:14:52,762
My noble father...

170
00:14:53,373 --> 00:14:57,400
...to you I am bound for life and education.

171
00:14:58,044 --> 00:15:02,777
My life and education both do learn me how to respect you.

172
00:15:02,982 --> 00:15:05,883
You are lord of all my duty.

173
00:15:06,586 --> 00:15:08,918
I am hitherto your daughter.

174
00:15:10,156 --> 00:15:12,181
But here's my husband.

175
00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:18,820
And so much duty as my mother showed to you...

176
00:15:19,032 --> 00:15:21,364
...preferring you before her father...

177
00:15:21,568 --> 00:15:25,971
...so much I challenge that I may profess due to the Moor...

178
00:15:26,172 --> 00:15:27,730
...my lord.

179
00:15:34,814 --> 00:15:37,612
God by you! I have done.

180
00:15:39,252 --> 00:15:43,518
I had rather to adopt a child than get it.

181
00:15:46,126 --> 00:15:47,821
Come hither, Moor.

182
00:15:52,298 --> 00:15:55,096
I here do give thee that with all my heart...

183
00:15:55,301 --> 00:15:57,895
...which, but thou hast already...

184
00:15:58,104 --> 00:16:03,041
...with all my heart I would keep from thee.

185
00:16:15,288 --> 00:16:19,622
I humbly beseech you, proceed with the affairs of state.

186
00:16:25,598 --> 00:16:30,535
The Turk, with a mighty preparation, makes for Cyprus.

187
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,032
Othello...

188
00:16:32,572 --> 00:16:34,437
...you must away tonight.

189
00:16:34,641 --> 00:16:38,168
The affair cries haste, and speed must answer it.

190
00:16:39,345 --> 00:16:41,779
Most gracious Duke....

191
00:16:50,557 --> 00:16:52,354
What would you, Desdemona?

192
00:16:54,093 --> 00:16:58,029
That I did love the Moor to live with him...

193
00:16:58,698 --> 00:17:01,792
...my downright violence and scorn of fortunes...

194
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:04,094
...may trumpet to the world.

195
00:17:04,771 --> 00:17:09,708
My heart is subdued even to the utmost pleasure of my lord.

196
00:17:11,844 --> 00:17:16,781
I saw Othello's visage in his mind...

197
00:17:18,151 --> 00:17:20,449
...and to his honors ，and his valiant parts...

198
00:17:20,653 --> 00:17:23,986
...did I my soul，and fortunes consecrate.

199
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:29,158
So that, dear lords...

200
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:34,295
...if I be left behind, a moth of peace, and he go to the war...

201
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,833
...the rites for which I love him are bereft me.

202
00:17:38,037 --> 00:17:41,529
And l, a heavy interim,
shall support by his dear absence.

203
00:17:41,741 --> 00:17:43,402
Let me go with him.

204
00:17:43,843 --> 00:17:45,708
Let her have your voice.

205
00:17:45,912 --> 00:17:47,777
And heaven defend your good souls...

206
00:17:47,981 --> 00:17:52,782
...that you think I will your serious
business scant for she is with me.

207
00:17:55,555 --> 00:17:58,217
Be it as you shall privately determine.

208
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:04,025
At 9 in the morning,
here we'll meet again.

209
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,355
Good night to everyone.

210
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:10,860
And, noble signor...

211
00:18:12,272 --> 00:18:16,231
...if virtue no delighted beauty lack...

212
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:21,175
...your son-in-law
is far more fair than black.

213
00:18:25,318 --> 00:18:30,255
Look to her, Moor,
if thou hast eyes to see.

214
00:18:30,957 --> 00:18:35,223
She has deceived her father
and may thee.

215
00:18:36,462 --> 00:18:38,794
My life upon her faith!

216
00:18:42,502 --> 00:18:45,835
Good lago, my Desdemona
must I leave to thee.

217
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:49,998
Let thy wife attend on her, and bring
them after in the best advantage.

218
00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:52,700
Come, we must obey the time.

219
00:19:04,457 --> 00:19:05,583
lago!

220
00:19:09,195 --> 00:19:11,390
What sayest thou, noble heart?

221
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:17,097
What will I do, thinkest thou?

222
00:19:17,603 --> 00:19:19,332
Why, go to bed and sleep.

223
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,706
I will incontinently drown myself.

224
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:26,174
If thou dost,
I shall never love thee after.

225
00:19:26,379 --> 00:19:28,643
Why, thou silly gentleman!

226
00:19:28,848 --> 00:19:33,785
It is silliness to live
when to live is a torment.

227
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,417
Desdemona!

228
00:19:38,591 --> 00:19:40,115
Villainous!

229
00:19:42,328 --> 00:19:45,991
I've looked upon the world for
four times seven years...

230
00:19:46,199 --> 00:19:49,896
...and I never yet found a man that
knew how to love himself.

231
00:19:50,103 --> 00:19:53,971
Ere I would say I would drown myself
for the love of a guinea hen...

232
00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:58,269
-...I'd change my humanity with a baboon.
-What should I do?

233
00:19:58,845 --> 00:20:01,279
I confess it is my shame
to be so fond...

234
00:20:01,481 --> 00:20:03,745
...but it is not in my virtue
to amend it.

235
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,383
Virtue? A fig.

236
00:20:05,585 --> 00:20:07,917
'Tis in ourselves
that we are thus or thus.

237
00:20:08,121 --> 00:20:11,022
We have reason
to cool our raging motions...

238
00:20:11,224 --> 00:20:13,988
...our carnal stings, our
unbitted lusts...

239
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:17,458
...whereof I take this, which you call
love, to be a sect or scion.

240
00:20:17,663 --> 00:20:18,823
It cannot be!

241
00:20:19,031 --> 00:20:22,933
It is merely a lust of the blood
and a permission of the will.

242
00:20:23,136 --> 00:20:24,603
Come, be a man!

243
00:20:24,804 --> 00:20:27,068
Drown thyself?

244
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:30,565
Drown cats and blind puppies.

245
00:20:32,745 --> 00:20:35,612
I have professed me thy friend
and I confess me...

246
00:20:35,815 --> 00:20:38,648
...knit to thy deserving with cables
of perdurable toughness.

247
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:42,446
I could never
better stead thee than now.

248
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,160
Put money in thy purse.

249
00:20:50,263 --> 00:20:53,426
Follow thou these wars.

250
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:57,566
Disguise thy features with
an usurped beard.

251
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,499
I say, put money in thy purse.

252
00:20:59,705 --> 00:21:03,436
It cannot be that Desdemona should
long continue her love to the Moor.

253
00:21:03,643 --> 00:21:05,611
Put but money in thy purse.

254
00:21:05,812 --> 00:21:08,781
When she's sated with his body,
she'll find the error of her choice.

255
00:21:08,981 --> 00:21:11,643
She must have change, she must.

256
00:21:12,318 --> 00:21:14,343
Fill thy purse with money.

257
00:21:14,554 --> 00:21:18,547
If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt
an erring barbarian...

258
00:21:18,758 --> 00:21:22,353
...and a super-subtle Venetian
be not too hard for my wits...

259
00:21:22,562 --> 00:21:24,189
...and all the tribe of hell...

260
00:21:24,397 --> 00:21:27,491
...thou shall enjoy her.

261
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,827
Therefore, put....

262
00:21:30,603 --> 00:21:32,503
"Money in thy purse."

263
00:21:33,973 --> 00:21:36,168
A pox on drowning, huh?

264
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,808
'Tis clean out of the way.

265
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,706
Seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy...

266
00:21:40,913 --> 00:21:43,347
...than to be drowned，and go without her.

267
00:21:48,187 --> 00:21:50,815
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes?

268
00:21:51,023 --> 00:21:53,583
Thou art sure of me.

269
00:21:53,826 --> 00:21:58,354
There are many events in the womb of time...

270
00:21:59,232 --> 00:22:01,325
...which will be delivered.

271
00:22:03,069 --> 00:22:04,934
Go, provide thy money.

272
00:22:05,371 --> 00:22:07,669
We will have more of this tomorrow.Adieu.

273
00:22:07,874 --> 00:22:09,808
Where shall we meet in the morning?

274
00:22:10,443 --> 00:22:12,968
-At my lodging.
-All right.

275
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:16,047
-I'll be with thee betimes.
-Go to, farewell.

276
00:22:16,249 --> 00:22:17,409
Does thou hear?

277
00:22:17,617 --> 00:22:18,584
What say thou?

278
00:22:18,784 --> 00:22:20,877
No more of drowning, do you hear?

279
00:22:21,087 --> 00:22:22,111
I am changed.

280
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:28,819
Go to, farewell. Put money enough in your purse!

281
00:22:29,028 --> 00:22:30,928
I'll sell all my land.

282
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:36,597
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse.

283
00:22:36,802 --> 00:22:39,498
For I mine own gained knowledge should profane...

284
00:22:39,705 --> 00:22:42,538
...if I would time，expend with such a snipe...

285
00:22:42,742 --> 00:22:45,233
...but for my sport and profit.

286
00:22:50,383 --> 00:22:55,320
I hate the Moor...

287
00:22:56,989 --> 00:22:59,856
...and it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets...

288
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:04,428
...he's done my office.

289
00:23:05,598 --> 00:23:06,792
I know not if it be true...

290
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:11,231
...but l, for mere suspicion in that kind...

291
00:23:12,004 --> 00:23:16,941
...will do as if for surety.

292
00:23:20,012 --> 00:23:21,912
He holds me well...

293
00:23:22,982 --> 00:23:27,180
...the better shall my purpose work on him.

294
00:23:29,755 --> 00:23:32,553
Cassio's a proper man.

295
00:23:32,792 --> 00:23:36,660
Let me see now--To get his place...

296
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:41,765
...and to plume up my will in double knavery....

297
00:23:42,668 --> 00:23:43,760
How?

298
00:23:46,639 --> 00:23:47,970
How?

299
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,442
I have it.

300
00:24:00,252 --> 00:24:02,720
It is engendered.

301
00:24:03,322 --> 00:24:05,882
Hell and night...

302
00:24:06,092 --> 00:24:10,529
...must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.

303
00:25:27,807 --> 00:25:30,935
-Hail to thee, lady.
-Thank you, valiant Cassio.

304
00:25:41,253 --> 00:25:44,552
Very good. Ay, well said, whisper.

305
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:49,260
With as little a web as this, will I ensnare...

306
00:25:49,462 --> 00:25:53,421
...as great a fly as Cassio.

307
00:26:13,486 --> 00:26:16,284
O, my fair warrior!

308
00:26:18,124 --> 00:26:19,648
My dear Othello!

309
00:26:20,025 --> 00:26:24,621
It gives me wonder great as my content to see you here before me.

310
00:26:31,036 --> 00:26:33,470
O my soul's joy!

311
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,331
I cannot speak enough of this content. It stops me here.

312
00:26:37,543 --> 00:26:40,103
It is too much of joy.

313
00:26:49,955 --> 00:26:51,479
News, friends:

314
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:54,659
Our wars are done, the Turks are drowned!

315
00:26:59,365 --> 00:27:01,993
This desperate storm hath seen a grievous wrack...

316
00:27:02,201 --> 00:27:04,601
...and sufferance on most part of their fleet.

317
00:27:04,804 --> 00:27:06,294
Worthy Montano.

318
00:27:06,906 --> 00:27:09,807
How does my old acquaintance of this isle?

319
00:27:10,009 --> 00:27:12,500
Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus.

320
00:27:12,711 --> 00:27:15,145
I have found great love amongst them.

321
00:27:16,015 --> 00:27:19,041
O, you are well tuned now!

322
00:27:19,251 --> 00:27:24,154
But I'll set down the pegs that make this music, as honest as I am.

323
00:28:44,069 --> 00:28:47,527
If thou be'st valiant -- as they say base men being in love have then...

324
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:51,642
...a nobility in their nature more than is native to them -- list me.

325
00:28:52,478 --> 00:28:55,572
The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard.

326
00:28:56,115 --> 00:28:58,242
First, I must tell thee this:

327
00:28:58,617 --> 00:29:01,347
Desdemona is directly in love with him.

328
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,349
With Cassio?

329
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:05,650
Why, 'tis not possible!

330
00:29:05,858 --> 00:29:08,588
Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.

331
00:29:08,794 --> 00:29:10,659
Mark me. Her eye must be fed.

332
00:29:10,863 --> 00:29:13,093
What delight shall she have to look on the devil?

333
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:16,132
Her delicate tenderness has found itself abused...

334
00:29:16,335 --> 00:29:20,499
...begun to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor.

335
00:29:20,706 --> 00:29:24,039
Her nature instructs her to it, and compels her to some second choice.

336
00:29:24,243 --> 00:29:27,679
I cannot believe that. She is full of most blessed condition.

337
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,438
Blessed fig 's-end!

338
00:29:29,882 --> 00:29:31,975
The wine she drinks is made of grapes.

339
00:29:32,351 --> 00:29:36,151
If she were blessed, she would never have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding.

340
00:29:36,455 --> 00:29:38,923
Didst thou not see her paddle with his hand?

341
00:29:39,124 --> 00:29:40,489
Didst thou not mark that?

342
00:29:40,693 --> 00:29:44,151
-But that was but courtesy.
-Lechery, by this hand...

343
00:29:46,098 --> 00:29:48,293
...an index and obscure prologue...

344
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,025
...to the history of lust and foul thoughts.

345
00:29:51,236 --> 00:29:54,763
They met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together.

346
00:29:54,974 --> 00:29:56,669
Villainous thoughts, Roderigo!

347
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:59,639
When these mutualities so marshal the way...

348
00:29:59,845 --> 00:30:01,745
...hard at hand comes the master...

349
00:30:01,947 --> 00:30:04,507
...and main exercise, the incorporate conclusion.

350
00:30:04,717 --> 00:30:08,278
But sir, be you ruled by me. I have brought you from Venice.

351
00:30:11,457 --> 00:30:13,516
Watch you with the guard tonight...

352
00:30:13,726 --> 00:30:17,127
...for the command I'll lay it upon you. I'll not be far from you.

353
00:30:17,663 --> 00:30:22,066
Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio.

354
00:30:24,136 --> 00:30:24,966
Well....

355
00:30:32,778 --> 00:30:34,803
Welcome, lago. We must to the watch.

356
00:30:35,014 --> 00:30:38,279
Not this hour, lieutenant. 'Tis not yet 1 0 of the clock.

357
00:30:38,484 --> 00:30:41,351
Our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona...

358
00:30:41,553 --> 00:30:43,316
...who let us not therefore blame.

359
00:30:43,522 --> 00:30:45,183
He hath not yet...

360
00:30:45,391 --> 00:30:49,020
...made wanton the night with her, and she is sport for Jove.

361
00:30:49,228 --> 00:30:50,889
She's a most exquisite lady.

362
00:30:51,096 --> 00:30:54,156
And I'll warrant her, full of game.

363
00:30:54,366 --> 00:30:56,197
She is indeed perfection.

364
00:30:56,402 --> 00:30:57,528
Well...

365
00:30:57,736 --> 00:30:59,294
...happiness to their sheets!

366
00:30:59,505 --> 00:31:01,268
Come, I have a stoop of wine...

367
00:31:01,473 --> 00:31:03,634
...and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants...

368
00:31:03,842 --> 00:31:05,935
...that would have a measure to the health of black Othello.

369
00:31:06,145 --> 00:31:07,612
Not tonight, good lago.

370
00:31:07,813 --> 00:31:09,872
I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking.

371
00:31:10,082 --> 00:31:12,414
I could well wish courtesy would invent...

372
00:31:12,618 --> 00:31:14,813
...some other custom of entertainment.

373
00:31:16,522 --> 00:31:18,683
They are our friends.

374
00:31:19,925 --> 00:31:21,825
But one cup? I'll drink for you.

375
00:31:22,027 --> 00:31:25,622
I have drunk a cup tonight already and
dare not task my weakness with anymore.

376
00:31:25,831 --> 00:31:28,425
What, man! 'Tis a night of revels.

377
00:31:28,634 --> 00:31:30,795
The gallants desire it.

378
00:31:33,272 --> 00:31:34,671
Where are they?

379
00:31:38,577 --> 00:31:41,569
If I can fasten ，but one cup upon him....

380
00:32:17,816 --> 00:32:19,647
The purchase made...

381
00:32:20,686 --> 00:32:23,154
...the fruits are to ensue...

382
00:32:24,022 --> 00:32:27,924
...that profit's yet to come between me and you.

383
00:33:49,675 --> 00:33:51,905
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?

384
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:55,079
Why, he drinks you with facility, your Dane dead drunk.

385
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,407
He sweats not to overthrow your Almain.

386
00:33:57,616 --> 00:34:01,484
And he gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled.

387
00:34:01,687 --> 00:34:03,086
Health to our general!

388
00:34:03,288 --> 00:34:05,518
I am for it, lieutenant...

389
00:34:06,391 --> 00:34:08,382
...and I'll do you justice.

390
00:34:24,309 --> 00:34:25,571
Sweet England!

391
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:34,710
Save you, friend Cassio.

392
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,388
Well, how is it with you, most fair...?

393
00:34:41,093 --> 00:34:42,253
Bianca.

394
00:34:44,596 --> 00:34:47,463
Let be gallantly!

395
00:34:50,736 --> 00:34:54,536
He was a wight of high renown

396
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:58,398
And thou art but of low degree

397
00:34:59,911 --> 00:35:04,439
'Tis pride that pulls the country down

398
00:35:05,384 --> 00:35:08,683
Then take thine auld cloak...

399
00:35:08,887 --> 00:35:11,481
...about thee

400
00:35:16,728 --> 00:35:18,593
Let' s have no more of this.

401
00:35:18,797 --> 00:35:20,355
Let' s to our affairs.

402
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,825
God forgive us our sins.

403
00:35:24,303 --> 00:35:27,397
Gentlemen, let's look to our business.

404
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:32,172
Do not think, gentlemen, that I am drunk.

405
00:35:33,011 --> 00:35:35,241
This is my ensign.

406
00:35:35,447 --> 00:35:37,210
This is my right hand.

407
00:35:38,116 --> 00:35:39,674
This is my left hand.

408
00:35:41,086 --> 00:35:43,111
I am not drunk now.

409
00:35:44,323 --> 00:35:46,348
I can stand well enough...

410
00:35:46,591 --> 00:35:48,058
...and I speak well enough.

411
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,955
-Excellent well.
-Why, very well.

412
00:35:52,331 --> 00:35:54,629
You must not think then
that I am drunk.

413
00:35:59,204 --> 00:36:02,037
To the platform, masters.
Come, let's set the watch.

414
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,538
You see this fellow that is gone before?

415
00:36:05,177 --> 00:36:09,273
He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar
and give direction.

416
00:36:09,581 --> 00:36:11,742
And do but see his vice.

417
00:36:11,983 --> 00:36:13,883
But is he often thus?

418
00:36:14,553 --> 00:36:17,488
'Tis evermore the prologue
to his sleep.

419
00:36:20,926 --> 00:36:23,861
-What's the matter, lieutenant?
-A knave teach me my duty!

420
00:36:24,062 --> 00:36:26,155
I'll beat the knave
into a twiggen bottle.

421
00:36:26,365 --> 00:36:28,993
-Beat me!
-Dost thou prate, rogue?

422
00:36:29,801 --> 00:36:31,428
Nay, good lieutenant.

423
00:36:31,636 --> 00:36:35,402
I pray you, sir, hold your hand.

424
00:36:36,141 --> 00:36:39,872
Let me go, sir, or I'll knock you
over the mazzard.

425
00:36:41,446 --> 00:36:43,311
Come, come...

426
00:36:43,515 --> 00:36:44,982
...you're drunk.

427
00:36:52,124 --> 00:36:53,148
Drunk?

428
00:36:55,527 --> 00:36:57,188
Nay, good lieutenant.

429
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,090
God's will, gentlemen!

430
00:37:07,706 --> 00:37:10,072
Good lieutenant, hold!

431
00:37:10,275 --> 00:37:12,243
Mutiny!

432
00:37:12,811 --> 00:37:14,403
Mutiny!

433
00:37:23,588 --> 00:37:24,748
Help, ho! Lieutenant!

434
00:37:33,398 --> 00:37:34,831
God's will, lieutenant.
Hold!

435
00:37:35,033 --> 00:37:37,593
Hold, for your lives!

436
00:37:37,803 --> 00:37:38,929
Hold, for shame!

437
00:37:39,137 --> 00:37:41,002
What's the matter here? !

438
00:37:41,206 --> 00:37:43,071
Are we turned Turks? !

439
00:37:43,842 --> 00:37:47,300
For Christian shame,
put by this barbarous brawl.

440
00:37:47,813 --> 00:37:50,714
He who stirs next
to carve for his own rage...

441
00:37:50,916 --> 00:37:52,281
...holds his soul light.

442
00:37:52,484 --> 00:37:55,317
He dies upon his motion.

443
00:37:57,422 --> 00:37:59,913
What is the matter, masters?

444
00:38:00,992 --> 00:38:02,152
Michael...

445
00:38:02,394 --> 00:38:04,862
...how comes it you are thus forgot?

446
00:38:07,532 --> 00:38:09,659
I pray you, pardon me, sir!

447
00:38:10,402 --> 00:38:12,029
I cannot speak.

448
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,967
Worthy Montano...

449
00:38:18,944 --> 00:38:22,175
...what is the matter that
you unlace your reputation thus...

450
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,645
...and spend your rich opinion for
the name of a night-brawler?

451
00:38:25,851 --> 00:38:30,652
-Give me answer to it.
-Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger.

452
00:38:30,856 --> 00:38:33,950
Your officer, lago, can inform you,
while I spare speech...

453
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:36,491
...of all that I do know.

454
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:49,834
Now, by heaven, my blood begins
my safer guides to rule.

455
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:54,102
On thy love I charge thee, lago.
Who began it?

456
00:38:54,312 --> 00:38:56,576
If partially affined or
leagued in office...

457
00:38:56,781 --> 00:38:59,978
...thou dost deliver more
or less than truth...

458
00:39:00,185 --> 00:39:02,085
...thou art no soldier.

459
00:39:02,287 --> 00:39:05,222
T ouch me not so near!
I had rather cut this tongue...

460
00:39:05,423 --> 00:39:07,687
...than it should do offense
to Michael Cassio.

461
00:39:10,795 --> 00:39:13,093
Yet to speak the truth
shall nothing wrong him.

462
00:39:13,298 --> 00:39:14,765
This it is, general:

463
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:18,268
Montano and myself being in speech,
comes a fellow crying for help...

464
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:22,338
...and Cassio following him with
determined sword to execute upon him.

465
00:39:22,641 --> 00:39:25,508
Sir, this gentleman steps in
to Cassio....

466
00:39:36,221 --> 00:39:38,883
--but more of this matter
can I not report.

467
00:39:43,929 --> 00:39:47,729
But men are men.
The best sometime forget.

468
00:39:47,933 --> 00:39:50,026
Though Cassio did
some little wrong to him...

469
00:39:50,235 --> 00:39:52,931
...as men in rage strike those
that wish them best...

470
00:39:53,138 --> 00:39:54,070
...yet surely Cassio--

471
00:39:54,272 --> 00:39:58,732
I know, lago, thy honesty and love
doth mince this matter...

472
00:39:58,944 --> 00:40:01,879
...making it light to Cassio.

473
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:22,191
Cassio...

474
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:29,466
...he that you hurt
is of great fame in Cyprus...

475
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:32,572
...and great affinity.

476
00:40:33,845 --> 00:40:35,278
I love thee...

477
00:40:37,282 --> 00:40:39,773
...but nevermore be officer of mine.

478
00:40:40,151 --> 00:40:41,709
What is the matter, dear?

479
00:40:42,954 --> 00:40:44,888
Look, if my gentle love
be not raised up.

480
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:47,388
I'll make thee an example.

481
00:40:49,094 --> 00:40:51,289
All's well now, sweeting.
Come away to bed.

482
00:40:51,496 --> 00:40:53,225
Look with care about the town...

483
00:40:53,431 --> 00:40:56,127
...and silence those
whom this vile brawl distracted.

484
00:40:56,334 --> 00:40:58,302
Come, sweet Desdemona.

485
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:14,446
-Are you hurt, lieutenant?
-Ay, past all surgery.

486
00:41:14,653 --> 00:41:17,816
-Marry, God forbid!
-I have lost my reputation.

487
00:41:18,456 --> 00:41:21,050
I have lost the immortal
part of myself...

488
00:41:21,259 --> 00:41:23,819
...and what remains is bestial.

489
00:41:24,029 --> 00:41:26,224
My reputation, lago!

490
00:41:26,431 --> 00:41:27,329
My reputation!

491
00:41:27,532 --> 00:41:29,466
I thought you'd received some wound.

492
00:41:29,668 --> 00:41:32,432
There's more offense in that
than in reputation.

493
00:41:34,673 --> 00:41:38,006
What, man! There are ways
to recover the general again.

494
00:41:38,209 --> 00:41:39,733
You are but now cast in his mood...

495
00:41:39,944 --> 00:41:42,139
...a punishment more in policy
than in malice.

496
00:41:42,347 --> 00:41:43,939
Sue to him again, and he's yours.

497
00:41:44,149 --> 00:41:45,776
I would rather sue to be despised...

498
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,815
...than to deceive
so good a commander...

499
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:51,887
...with so slight, so drunken and
so indiscreet an officer.

500
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:53,421
He that you followed...

501
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:56,059
-...what had he done to you?
-I know not.

502
00:41:56,261 --> 00:41:57,091
Is it possible?

503
00:41:57,295 --> 00:41:58,125
Drunk!

504
00:41:58,329 --> 00:42:01,059
Wine is a good
familiar creature, if it be well used.

505
00:42:01,266 --> 00:42:03,632
Exclaim no more against it.

506
00:42:03,835 --> 00:42:07,032
And good lieutenant...

507
00:42:07,472 --> 00:42:10,532
...l think you think I love you.

508
00:42:12,544 --> 00:42:13,943
I have well approved it, sir.

509
00:42:15,113 --> 00:42:17,206
I'll tell you what you shall do.

510
00:42:17,649 --> 00:42:20,618
Our general's wife is now the general.

511
00:42:21,453 --> 00:42:24,115
Confess yourself freely to Desdemona.

512
00:42:24,322 --> 00:42:27,655
lmportune her. She'll help
to put you in your place again.

513
00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:30,726
This broken joint
between you and her husband...

514
00:42:30,929 --> 00:42:32,692
...entreat her to splinter.

515
00:42:32,897 --> 00:42:36,264
And my fortunes
against any lay worth naming...

516
00:42:36,468 --> 00:42:40,871
...this crack of your love shall
grow stronger than it was before.

517
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:44,201
You advise me well.

518
00:42:44,676 --> 00:42:48,237
I protest, in the sincerity of love
and honest kindness.

519
00:42:48,446 --> 00:42:50,311
I think it freely.

520
00:42:56,688 --> 00:42:58,485
Good night, lieutenant.

521
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:00,715
I must to the watch.

522
00:43:01,059 --> 00:43:03,459
Good night, honest lago.

523
00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:10,497
How am I then a villain...

524
00:43:10,702 --> 00:43:13,227
...when this advice is free I give
and honest...

525
00:43:13,438 --> 00:43:17,374
...probal to thinking, and indeed
the course to win the Moor again?

526
00:43:17,575 --> 00:43:21,978
His soul is so enfettered
to Desdemona's love...

527
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:25,775
...that she may make, unmake,
do what she list...

528
00:43:25,984 --> 00:43:30,011
...even as her appetite shall
play the god with his weak function.

529
00:43:30,221 --> 00:43:32,621
How am I then a villain
to counsel Cassio...

530
00:43:32,824 --> 00:43:35,850
...to this parallel course,
directed to his good?

531
00:43:36,661 --> 00:43:39,323
Divinity of hell!

532
00:43:40,165 --> 00:43:44,192
When devils will the blackest sins
put on, they do suggest at first...

533
00:43:44,402 --> 00:43:46,734
...with heavenly shows, as I do now.

534
00:43:46,938 --> 00:43:51,568
For whiles this honest fool plies
Desdemona to repair his fortunes...

535
00:43:51,776 --> 00:43:54,939
...and she for him
pleads strongly to the Moor...

536
00:43:55,146 --> 00:43:57,614
...I'll pour this pestilence
into his ear...

537
00:43:57,816 --> 00:44:01,650
...that she repeals him for
her body's lust...

538
00:44:01,853 --> 00:44:04,879
...and by how much she strives
to do him good...

539
00:44:05,089 --> 00:44:09,492
...she shall undo her credit
with the Moor.

540
00:44:13,164 --> 00:44:16,258
So will I turn her virtue...

541
00:44:20,672 --> 00:44:22,469
...into pitch.

542
00:44:23,241 --> 00:44:25,937
And out of her own goodness...

543
00:44:26,144 --> 00:44:28,169
...make the net...

544
00:44:28,379 --> 00:44:30,313
...that shall...

545
00:44:30,515 --> 00:44:32,380
...enmesh them all.

546
00:44:36,988 --> 00:44:38,853
How now, Roderigo?

547
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:42,086
I do follow here in the chase...

548
00:44:42,327 --> 00:44:45,091
...not like a hound that hunts...

549
00:44:45,296 --> 00:44:48,094
...but one that fills up the cry.

550
00:44:48,566 --> 00:44:51,194
My money is almost spent.

551
00:44:51,402 --> 00:44:55,338
I have been tonight
exceedingly well-cudgeled.

552
00:44:56,241 --> 00:44:59,301
And I think the issue will be...

553
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:02,741
...that I shall have
so much experience for my pains.

554
00:45:02,947 --> 00:45:04,312
And so...

555
00:45:05,049 --> 00:45:08,917
...with no money at all and
a little more wit...

556
00:45:10,255 --> 00:45:12,689
...return again to Venice.

557
00:45:13,992 --> 00:45:17,257
How poor are they
that have not patience.

558
00:45:18,263 --> 00:45:21,892
What wound did ever heal
but by degrees?

559
00:45:22,467 --> 00:45:24,992
Thou knowest we work by wit...

560
00:45:25,203 --> 00:45:27,068
...and not by witchcraft.

561
00:45:27,272 --> 00:45:30,537
And wit depends on dilatory time.

562
00:45:31,342 --> 00:45:33,003
Does it not go well?

563
00:45:35,146 --> 00:45:37,137
Cassio hath beaten thee.

564
00:45:39,884 --> 00:45:43,320
And thou, by that small hurt...

565
00:45:43,521 --> 00:45:46,649
...hath cashiered Cassio.

566
00:45:50,728 --> 00:45:52,628
Content thyself awhile.

567
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,840
By the mass, 'tis morning.

568
00:46:06,277 --> 00:46:09,644
Pleasure and action
make the hours seem short.

569
00:46:10,248 --> 00:46:11,772
Retire thee awhile.

570
00:46:14,786 --> 00:46:16,447
Away, I say.

571
00:46:16,955 --> 00:46:19,253
Thou shalt know more hereafter.

572
00:46:21,025 --> 00:46:22,754
Nay, get thee gone.

573
00:46:40,511 --> 00:46:41,773
Bounteous madam...

574
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,971
...whatever shall become of
Michael Cassio?

575
00:46:44,182 --> 00:46:47,811
-He's never anything but your servant.
-I know it.

576
00:46:48,252 --> 00:46:49,514
I thank you.

577
00:46:50,855 --> 00:46:52,152
Madam, here comes my lord.

578
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,427
-I like not that.
-What dost thou say?

579
00:46:58,997 --> 00:46:59,964
Nothing, my lord.

580
00:47:00,331 --> 00:47:03,027
-Madam, I take my leave.
-Farewell.

581
00:47:05,837 --> 00:47:07,862
Was not that Cassio
parted from my wife?

582
00:47:08,072 --> 00:47:09,004
Cassio, my lord.

583
00:47:11,342 --> 00:47:13,173
How now, my lord?

584
00:47:13,745 --> 00:47:16,213
I have been talking with
a suitor here...

585
00:47:16,414 --> 00:47:18,473
...a man that languishes in
your displeasure.

586
00:47:18,683 --> 00:47:20,173
Who is it you mean?

587
00:47:20,385 --> 00:47:22,410
Why, your lieutenant, Cassio.

588
00:47:22,887 --> 00:47:25,515
Good my lord, if he be not one
that truly loves you...

589
00:47:25,723 --> 00:47:28,385
...l have no judgment in an honest face.

590
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:46,009
Excellent wretch!

591
00:47:47,111 --> 00:47:50,376
Perdition catch my soul,
but I do love thee!

592
00:47:52,683 --> 00:47:54,878
And when I love thee not...

593
00:47:55,853 --> 00:47:57,878
...chaos is come again.

594
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:02,482
-My noble lord--
-What dost thou say, lago?

595
00:48:02,693 --> 00:48:06,094
Did Cassio, when you wooed
my lady, know of your love?

596
00:48:06,297 --> 00:48:08,128
He did, from first to last.

597
00:48:12,904 --> 00:48:14,531
Why dost thou ask?

598
00:48:14,739 --> 00:48:18,072
But for a satisfaction of my thought--
No further harm.

599
00:48:23,281 --> 00:48:25,681
Why of thy thought, lago?

600
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:28,418
I did not think he had been
acquainted with her.

601
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:29,984
O, yes.

602
00:48:30,855 --> 00:48:32,482
And went between us very oft.

603
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:34,453
-lndeed!
-lndeed?

604
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:36,521
Ay, indeed.

605
00:48:37,762 --> 00:48:40,162
Discernest thou aught in that?
Is he not honest?

606
00:48:40,364 --> 00:48:41,661
Honest, my lord?

607
00:48:42,133 --> 00:48:43,623
Honest? Ay, honest.

608
00:48:44,001 --> 00:48:45,696
My lord, for aught I know.

609
00:48:45,903 --> 00:48:47,768
-What dost thou think?
-Think, my lord?

610
00:48:47,972 --> 00:48:50,634
"Think, my lord" !
By heaven, he echoes me.

611
00:48:50,842 --> 00:48:52,434
Thou dost mean something.

612
00:48:52,643 --> 00:48:55,612
If thou dost love me,
show me thy thought.

613
00:48:56,747 --> 00:49:00,205
-My lord, you know I love you.
-I think thou dost.

614
00:49:00,651 --> 00:49:03,051
And for I know
thou art full of love...

615
00:49:03,254 --> 00:49:04,653
...and honesty...

616
00:49:05,156 --> 00:49:07,920
...and weighest thy words
before thou givest them breath.

617
00:49:08,126 --> 00:49:10,822
Therefore, these stops of thine
fright me the more.

618
00:49:11,028 --> 00:49:13,861
For Cassio, I dare be sworn
I think that he is honest.

619
00:49:14,465 --> 00:49:15,693
I think so too.

620
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,333
Men should be what they seem.

621
00:49:17,535 --> 00:49:19,969
Or those that be not,
would they might seem none.

622
00:49:20,171 --> 00:49:21,934
Certain, men should be
what they seem.

623
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,608
Why then, I think Cassio's
an honest man.

624
00:49:24,809 --> 00:49:26,572
Nay, yet there's more in this!

625
00:49:26,777 --> 00:49:29,041
I prithee, speak to me as to
thy thinkings.

626
00:49:29,247 --> 00:49:32,808
As thou dost ruminate, give thy
worst of thoughts the worst of words.

627
00:49:33,017 --> 00:49:34,882
I do beseech you--

628
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:38,318
Though I perchance am

vicious in my guess...

629
00:49:38,523 --> 00:49:42,482
...as I confess, it is my
nature's plague to spy into abuses...

630
00:49:42,693 --> 00:49:44,923
...and oft my jealousy...

631
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:48,597
...shapes faults that are not.

632
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:52,302
I entreat you then, it were not for
your quiet nor your good...

633
00:49:52,503 --> 00:49:57,440
...nor for my manhood, honesty and
wisdom to let you know my thoughts.

634
00:49:57,675 --> 00:49:59,074
What dost thou mean?

635
00:50:00,111 --> 00:50:03,239
Good name in man and woman,
dear my lord...

636
00:50:03,447 --> 00:50:06,814
...is the immediate jewel
of their souls.

637
00:50:07,018 --> 00:50:09,543
Who steals my purse,
steals trash.

638
00:50:09,754 --> 00:50:12,848
'Tis something, nothing.
'Twas mine, 'tis his...

639
00:50:13,057 --> 00:50:14,251
...has been slave to thousands.

640
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:17,552
But he that filches from me
my good name...

641
00:50:17,762 --> 00:50:20,230
...robs me of that
which not enriches him...

642
00:50:20,431 --> 00:50:23,025
...and makes me poor indeed.

643
00:50:24,602 --> 00:50:28,231
By heaven, I'll know thy thought.

644
00:50:28,439 --> 00:50:30,236
You cannot, if my heart
were in your hand.

645
00:50:30,441 --> 00:50:33,308
Nor shall not,
while 'tis in my custody.

646
00:50:34,979 --> 00:50:37,812
O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!

647
00:50:38,082 --> 00:50:42,314
'Tis the green-eyed monster
that doth mock the meat it feeds on.

648
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,012
Why?

649
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:48,486
Why is this?

650
00:50:49,894 --> 00:50:53,352
Thinkest thou I'd make
a life of jealousy...

651
00:50:53,564 --> 00:50:57,728
...to follow still the changes of
the moon with fresh suspicions? No!

652
00:50:58,769 --> 00:51:01,363
T o be once in doubt
is once to be resolved.

653
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:04,667
Nor from mine own weak merits
shall I draw...

654
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:09,608
...the smallest fear or doubt of her
revolt, for she had eyes and chose me.

655
00:51:09,814 --> 00:51:10,803
No, lago...

656
00:51:11,882 --> 00:51:15,784
...I'll see before I doubt.
When I doubt, prove.

657
00:51:15,987 --> 00:51:18,012
And on the proof,
there is no more but this:

658
00:51:18,222 --> 00:51:20,383
Away at once with love or jealousy.

659
00:51:20,591 --> 00:51:22,218
I am glad, for now I have reason...

660
00:51:22,426 --> 00:51:25,520
...to show the love and duty
that I bear you with franker spirit.

661
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:29,689
Therefore, as I am bound,
receive it from me.

662
00:51:30,601 --> 00:51:32,569
I speak not yet of proof.

663
00:51:38,576 --> 00:51:39,975
Look to your wife.

664
00:51:42,647 --> 00:51:45,912
Observe her well with Cassio.

665
00:51:46,984 --> 00:51:48,508
Look to it.

666
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,881
I know our country disposition well.

667
00:51:52,089 --> 00:51:54,785
In Venice, they do
let heaven see the pranks...

668
00:51:54,992 --> 00:51:56,983
...they dare not show their husbands.

669
00:51:57,194 --> 00:51:59,685
Their best conscience
is not to leave it undone...

670
00:51:59,897 --> 00:52:01,865
...but keep it unknown.

671
00:52:08,506 --> 00:52:10,974
-Dost thou say so?
-She did deceive her father.

672
00:52:11,175 --> 00:52:13,837
And when she seemed to fear your looks,
she loved them most.

673
00:52:14,045 --> 00:52:16,605
-And so she did.
-Why, go to then.

674
00:52:21,952 --> 00:52:23,647
But I am much to blame.

675
00:52:25,823 --> 00:52:29,816
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
for too much loving you.

676
00:52:30,027 --> 00:52:32,018
I am bound to thee forever.

677
00:52:35,399 --> 00:52:36,991
I see this hath dashed your spirits.

678
00:52:37,201 --> 00:52:39,795
-Not a jot, not a jot.
-ln faith, I fear it has.

679
00:52:40,004 --> 00:52:42,495
I hope you consider what is spoke
comes from my love.

680
00:52:42,707 --> 00:52:44,641
But I do see you're moved.

681
00:52:44,842 --> 00:52:48,209
I am to pray you not to strain
my speech to grosser issues...

682
00:52:48,412 --> 00:52:50,539
...nor to larger reach than
to suspicion.

683
00:52:50,748 --> 00:52:52,375
Should you do so, my lord...

684
00:52:52,583 --> 00:52:55,518
...my speech should fall into vile
success as my thoughts aimed not at.

685
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,314
Cassio's my worthy friend--
My lord, you're moved.

686
00:52:58,522 --> 00:52:59,853
No, not much moved!

687
00:53:00,057 --> 00:53:01,922
I do not think but Desdemona's honest.

688
00:53:02,126 --> 00:53:05,186
Long live she so.
And long live you to think so.

689
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:09,388
And yet, how nature erring from itself--

690
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,329
Ay, there's the point!

691
00:53:11,535 --> 00:53:13,901
As to be bold not to enter
into a marriage...

692
00:53:14,105 --> 00:53:16,699
...of her own clime, complexion
and degree...

693
00:53:16,907 --> 00:53:20,843
...whereto we see in all things
nature tends--

694
00:53:21,212 --> 00:53:23,772
One may smell in such
a will most rank...

695
00:53:23,981 --> 00:53:27,883
...foul disproportion,
thoughts unnatural.

696
00:53:40,664 --> 00:53:45,431
But pardon me. I do not in position
distinctly speak of her.

697
00:53:45,636 --> 00:53:50,198
Though I may fear, her will,
recoiling to her better judgment...

698
00:53:50,408 --> 00:53:53,639
...may fall to match you with
her country forms...

699
00:53:53,844 --> 00:53:55,835
...and happily repent.

700
00:53:57,515 --> 00:53:59,142
Farewell, farewell.

701
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:02,808
If more thou dost perceive,
let me know more.

702
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,719
Leave me, lago.

703
00:54:04,922 --> 00:54:06,947
My lord, I take my leave.

704
00:54:13,097 --> 00:54:14,997
Why did I marry?

705
00:54:16,534 --> 00:54:19,025
My lord, I would
I might entreat your honor...

706
00:54:19,236 --> 00:54:21,500
...to scan this thing no farther.

707
00:54:21,705 --> 00:54:22,694
Leave it to time.

708
00:54:23,841 --> 00:54:25,741
Let me be thought too busy
in my fears--

709
00:54:25,943 --> 00:54:28,969
--as worthy cause
I have to fear I am--

710
00:54:29,447 --> 00:54:31,438
--and hold her free.

711
00:54:31,816 --> 00:54:33,249
Fear not my government.

712
00:54:40,758 --> 00:54:44,819
That we can call
these delicate creatures ours...

713
00:54:45,262 --> 00:54:47,696
...and not their appetites!


714
00:55:25,745 --> 00:55:27,940
How now, my dear Othello!

715
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:30,978
Your dinner and the generous
islanders by you invited...

716
00:55:31,183 --> 00:55:33,378
...do attend your presence.

717
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:37,751
-I am to blame.
-Why do you speak so faintly?

718
00:55:40,893 --> 00:55:42,485
Are you not well?

719
00:55:52,538 --> 00:55:55,666
Come, I'll go with you.

720
00:56:48,794 --> 00:56:50,284
I have a thing for you.

721
00:56:50,496 --> 00:56:53,897
You have a thing for me?

722
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:58,197
It is a common thing
to have a foolish wife.

723
00:56:58,404 --> 00:56:59,996
O, is that all?

724
00:57:02,475 --> 00:57:04,466
What will you give me for
that handkerchief?

725
00:57:04,677 --> 00:57:06,304
What handkerchief?

726
00:57:06,712 --> 00:57:08,441
What handkerchief?

727
00:57:09,382 --> 00:57:14,319
Why, that the Moor
first gave to Desdemona...

728
00:57:15,388 --> 00:57:19,017
...that which so often you did
bid me steal.

729
00:57:19,925 --> 00:57:24,225
Hast stolen it from her?

730
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:25,419
No, faith.

731
00:57:25,898 --> 00:57:28,423
She let it drop by negligence.

732
00:57:43,549 --> 00:57:46,177
What will you do with it,
that you've been so earnest...

733
00:57:46,385 --> 00:57:48,046
...to have me filch it?

734
00:58:01,901 --> 00:58:04,096
Trifles light as air...

735
00:58:04,303 --> 00:58:09,240
...are to the jealous confirmations
strong as proofs of holy writ.

736
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:12,505
This may do something.

737
00:58:53,152 --> 00:58:55,552
My life upon her faith.

738
00:59:03,395 --> 00:59:05,761
If she be false...

739
00:59:06,232 --> 00:59:08,359
...heaven mocks itself.

740
00:59:11,137 --> 00:59:12,968
I'll not believe it.

741
00:59:13,172 --> 00:59:17,666
Look to her, Moor,
if thou hast eyes to see.

742
00:59:18,144 --> 00:59:20,977
She has deceived her father...

743
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:22,943
...and may thee.

744
00:59:47,907 --> 00:59:50,307
The Moor already changes
with my poison.

745
00:59:51,076 --> 00:59:54,705
Dangerous conceits
are in their natures, poisons.

746
00:59:54,914 --> 00:59:59,078
Which at the first
are scarce found to distaste.

747
00:59:59,285 --> 01:00:02,982
But with a little
act upon the blood...

748
01:00:03,189 --> 01:00:07,148
...burn like the mines of sulfur.

749
01:00:08,227 --> 01:00:10,092
I did say so.

750
01:00:10,663 --> 01:00:11,652
Look!

751
01:00:13,966 --> 01:00:16,799
Not poppy, nor mandragora...

752
01:00:17,002 --> 01:00:18,833
...nor all the drowsy syrups
of the world...

753
01:00:19,038 --> 01:00:21,563
...shall ever medicine thee
to that sweet sleep...

754
01:00:21,774 --> 01:00:24,334
... which thou owedst yesterday.

755
01:00:26,178 --> 01:00:28,146
Why, how now, general !

756
01:00:30,216 --> 01:00:31,410
Avaunt!

757
01:00:32,251 --> 01:00:33,513
Be gone!

758
01:00:34,186 --> 01:00:36,416
Thou hast set me on the rack.

759
01:00:36,622 --> 01:00:40,388
I swear 'tis better to be much abused
than but to know it a little.

760
01:00:40,593 --> 01:00:41,753
How now, my lord!

761
01:00:41,961 --> 01:00:44,862
What sense had l
of her stolen hours of lust?

762
01:00:45,064 --> 01:00:49,160
I saw it not, thought it not,
it harmed not me.

763
01:00:49,368 --> 01:00:51,427
I found not Cassio's kisses
on her lips.

764
01:00:51,637 --> 01:00:53,161
I am sorry to hear this.

765
01:00:53,372 --> 01:00:55,897
I had been happy if the general camp,
pioneers and all...

766
01:00:56,108 --> 01:00:58,576
...had tasted her sweet body,
so I had nothing known.

767
01:00:58,777 --> 01:01:02,770
Now forever farewell the tranquil mind!

768
01:01:02,982 --> 01:01:04,381
Farewell content!

769
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:07,676
Farewell the plumed troop and
wars that make ambition virtue.

770
01:01:07,887 --> 01:01:09,377
O, farewell!

771
01:01:09,588 --> 01:01:12,056
Othello's occupation's gone.

772
01:01:12,258 --> 01:01:13,350
Is it possible, my lord?

773
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:17,120
Villain, be sure
thou prove my love a whore!

774
01:01:17,329 --> 01:01:18,353
Be sure of it.

775
01:01:18,564 --> 01:01:20,429
Give me the ocular proof...

776
01:01:20,633 --> 01:01:22,931
...or by the worth
of mine eternal soul...

777
01:01:23,135 --> 01:01:25,695
...thou hadst been better
been born a dog...

778
01:01:25,905 --> 01:01:28,100
...than answer my waked wrath!

779
01:01:28,307 --> 01:01:30,002
Make me to see it...

780
01:01:30,209 --> 01:01:31,904
...or at least, so prove it...

781
01:01:32,111 --> 01:01:34,579
...that the probation bear no hinge...

782
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:36,611
...nor loop to hang a doubt on...

783
01:01:36,815 --> 01:01:38,806
-...or woe upon thy life!
-My noble lord!

784
01:01:39,018 --> 01:01:42,818
If thou dost slander her
and torture me...

785
01:01:43,022 --> 01:01:46,116
...never pray more,
abandon all remorse!

786
01:01:46,325 --> 01:01:48,816
On horror's head, horrors accumulate!

787
01:01:49,028 --> 01:01:50,859
Do deeds to make heaven weep...

788
01:01:51,063 --> 01:01:55,432
...for nothing to damnation
canst thou add greater than that!

789
01:01:58,404 --> 01:01:59,928
O grace!

790
01:02:02,841 --> 01:02:05,071
O heaven defend me!

791
01:02:06,378 --> 01:02:08,972
God buy you!
Take mine office.

792
01:02:09,181 --> 01:02:12,150
T o be direct and honest is not safe.

793
01:02:12,418 --> 01:02:16,184
I thank you for this profit.
From hence, I'll love no friend...

794
01:02:16,388 --> 01:02:18,754
...sith love breeds such offense!

795
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:22,994
Nay, stay!

796
01:02:23,195 --> 01:02:25,186
-Thou shouldst be honest.
-I should be wise...

797
01:02:25,397 --> 01:02:28,594
...for honesty's a fool,
and loses that it works for.

798
01:02:29,234 --> 01:02:31,464
By the world,
I think my wife be honest...

799
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:33,695
...and I think that she is not.

800
01:02:33,906 --> 01:02:35,874
I think that thou art just
and that thou art not.

801
01:02:36,075 --> 01:02:39,238
I'll have some proof.
Would I were satisfied!

802
01:02:42,548 --> 01:02:45,278
I see, sir,
you are eaten up with passion.

803
01:02:45,484 --> 01:02:47,975
I do repent me that I put it to you.

804
01:02:48,587 --> 01:02:50,714
-You would be satisfied?
-Would? Nay, I will.

805
01:02:50,923 --> 01:02:53,016
And may. But how?
How satisfied?

806
01:02:53,225 --> 01:02:55,921
Would you grossly gape on?
Behold her topped?

807
01:02:56,128 --> 01:02:57,493
O, death and damnation!

808
01:02:57,696 --> 01:02:59,926
It were a tedious difficulty
to bring them to that prospect.

809
01:03:00,132 --> 01:03:01,656
Damn them then!
What shall I say?

810
01:03:01,867 --> 01:03:03,596
Where's satisfaction?

811
01:03:03,902 --> 01:03:05,164
You would not see this...

812
01:03:05,371 --> 01:03:07,805
...were they as prime as goats,
as hot as monkeys--

813
01:03:08,007 --> 01:03:11,238
But yet, I say, if imputation
and strong circumstances...

814
01:03:11,443 --> 01:03:15,209
...which lead directly to the door of
truth will give you satisfaction...

815
01:03:15,414 --> 01:03:17,075
...you might have it.

816
01:03:17,916 --> 01:03:21,147
Give me a living reason she's disloyal.

817
01:03:21,353 --> 01:03:23,446
I do not like the office.

818
01:03:23,655 --> 01:03:25,623
But sith I am entered in this cause...

819
01:03:25,824 --> 01:03:29,624
...pricked to it by foolish honesty
and love, I will go on.

820
01:03:32,698 --> 01:03:34,791
I lay with Cassio lately.

821
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,959
And being troubled with a raging tooth,
I could not sleep.

822
01:03:39,171 --> 01:03:41,332
There are a kind of men
so loose of soul...

823
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:43,872
...that in their sleeps will
mutter their affairs.

824
01:03:44,076 --> 01:03:46,408
One of this kind is Cassio.

825
01:03:46,612 --> 01:03:50,013
In sleep, I heard him say:

826
01:03:50,849 --> 01:03:54,876
"Sweet Desdemona, let us be wary,
let us hide our loves."

827
01:03:55,554 --> 01:03:59,217
And then, sir, would he grip
and wring my hand...

828
01:03:59,425 --> 01:04:01,620
...cry, "Sweet creature!"
and then kiss me hard...

829
01:04:01,827 --> 01:04:05,058
...as if he plucked kisses from
the roots upon my lips...

830
01:04:05,264 --> 01:04:07,232
...then laid his leg over my thigh...

831
01:04:07,433 --> 01:04:09,731
...and sighed and kissed
and cried:

832
01:04:09,935 --> 01:04:12,369
"Cursed fate
that gave thee to the Moor!"

833
01:04:12,571 --> 01:04:14,698
-O monstrous!
-Nay, this was but his dream.

834
01:04:14,907 --> 01:04:16,431
-Monstrous!
-Nay, yet be wise...

835
01:04:16,642 --> 01:04:18,473
...yet we see nothing done.

836
01:04:18,677 --> 01:04:20,941
She may be honest yet.
Tell me but this:

837
01:04:21,146 --> 01:04:22,738
Did you not see
a handkerchief...

838
01:04:22,948 --> 01:04:25,007
...spotted with strawberries
in your wife's hand?

839
01:04:25,217 --> 01:04:27,583
I gave her such a one.
'Twas my first gift.

840
01:04:27,786 --> 01:04:29,981
I know not that.
But such a handkerchief...

841
01:04:30,189 --> 01:04:31,747
...I'm sure it was your wife's...

842
01:04:31,957 --> 01:04:35,085
...did I today see
Cassio wipe his beard with.

843
01:04:35,294 --> 01:04:37,228
O, if it be that--

844
01:04:59,418 --> 01:05:01,545
Where should I lose
that handkerchief, Emilia?

845
01:05:01,753 --> 01:05:02,720
I know not, madam.

846
01:05:02,921 --> 01:05:07,381
Believe me, I had rather lose
my purse full of crusadoes.

847
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:10,655
And, but my noble Moor
is true of mind...

848
01:05:10,863 --> 01:05:14,355
...and made of no such baseness as
jealous creatures are...

849
01:05:14,566 --> 01:05:17,296
...it were enough
to put him to ill thinking.

850
01:05:17,503 --> 01:05:19,801
-ls he not jealous?
-Who, he?

851
01:05:26,912 --> 01:05:28,504
How is it with you, my lord?

852
01:05:29,348 --> 01:05:30,372
Well.

853
01:05:30,983 --> 01:05:34,282
-And how do you, my lady?
-Well, my good lord.

854
01:05:34,786 --> 01:05:39,086
That handkerchief did an Egyptian
to my mother give.

855
01:05:39,291 --> 01:05:43,455
She was a charmer and could almost
read the thoughts of people.

856
01:05:43,662 --> 01:05:46,654
She told her while she kept it,
'twould make her amiable...

857
01:05:46,865 --> 01:05:49,595
...and subdue my father entirely
to her love.

858
01:05:49,801 --> 01:05:53,237
But if she lost it
or made a gift of it...

859
01:05:53,438 --> 01:05:56,373
...my father's eye
should hold her loathed...

860
01:05:56,575 --> 01:05:59,237
...and his spirits should hunt
after new fancies.

861
01:05:59,444 --> 01:06:00,934
She dying...

862
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,113
...gave it me...

863
01:06:03,549 --> 01:06:07,280
...and bid me, when my fate would
have me wived...

864
01:06:07,486 --> 01:06:08,680
...l give it her.

865
01:06:08,887 --> 01:06:10,411
I did so.

866
01:06:10,889 --> 01:06:12,857
And take heed on it.

867
01:06:13,225 --> 01:06:16,717
Make it a darling
like your precious eye.

868
01:06:17,396 --> 01:06:19,990
To lose it or give it away...

869
01:06:20,199 --> 01:06:24,431
...were such perdition
as nothing else could match.

870
01:06:24,803 --> 01:06:26,202
Is it possible?

871
01:06:26,405 --> 01:06:28,032
'Tis true.

872
01:06:28,574 --> 01:06:30,405
There's magic in the web of it.

873
01:06:30,709 --> 01:06:33,200
Then would to God I had never seen it!

874
01:06:33,412 --> 01:06:34,538
Wherefore?

875
01:06:34,746 --> 01:06:36,509
Why do you speak
so startingly and rash?

876
01:06:36,715 --> 01:06:38,706
Is it lost? Is it gone?
Is it out of the way?

877
01:06:38,917 --> 01:06:40,441
Heaven bless us!

878
01:06:40,652 --> 01:06:42,119
-Say you?
-lt is not lost.

879
01:06:42,321 --> 01:06:44,016
-But what an if it were?
-How?

880
01:06:44,223 --> 01:06:45,986
I say it is not lost!

881
01:06:46,391 --> 01:06:48,416
Fetch it.
Let me see it.

882
01:06:48,627 --> 01:06:51,824
Why, so I can, sir.
But I will not now.

883
01:06:52,030 --> 01:06:54,260
This is a trick
to put me from my suit.

884
01:06:54,466 --> 01:06:57,367
I pray you,
let Cassio be received again.

885
01:06:57,569 --> 01:06:59,594
Fetch me my handkerchief.
My mind misgives.

886
01:06:59,805 --> 01:07:02,399
Come. You'll never meet
a more sufficient man.

887
01:07:02,608 --> 01:07:05,076
-The handkerchief!
-I pray you, talk me of Cassio...

888
01:07:05,277 --> 01:07:08,542
...a man that all his time hath founded
his good fortunes on your love.

889
01:07:08,747 --> 01:07:10,874
The handkerchief!

890
01:07:11,116 --> 01:07:13,016
In faith, you are to blame.

891
01:07:15,854 --> 01:07:17,788
'Zounds!

892
01:07:25,764 --> 01:07:28,255
Is not this man jealous?

893
01:07:29,268 --> 01:07:31,395
I never saw this before.

894
01:07:31,737 --> 01:07:34,570
'Tis not a year or two shows us a man.

895
01:07:37,609 --> 01:07:41,010
They are all but stomachs,
and we all but food.

896
01:07:41,213 --> 01:07:44,273
They eat us hungrily.
And when they are full...

897
01:07:44,483 --> 01:07:45,541
...they belch us.

898
01:07:51,189 --> 01:07:53,453
If I give my wife a handkerchief...

899
01:07:53,659 --> 01:07:55,149
...'tis hers, and being hers...

900
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,453
...she may, I think,
bestow it on any man.

901
01:07:57,663 --> 01:08:00,928
What if I had said
I had seen him do you wrong?

902
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:02,928
Or heard him say--

903
01:08:03,135 --> 01:08:04,727
Hath he said anything?

904
01:08:05,203 --> 01:08:07,603
He hath, my lord.
But no more than he'll unswear.

905
01:08:07,806 --> 01:08:10,969
-What hath he said?
-Faith, that he...

906
01:08:11,977 --> 01:08:13,035
...did....

907
01:08:17,983 --> 01:08:20,975
I know not what he did.

908
01:08:23,955 --> 01:08:24,922
What?

909
01:08:27,125 --> 01:08:28,217
What?

910
01:08:30,796 --> 01:08:32,058
Lie....

911
01:08:33,131 --> 01:08:34,393
With her?

912
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:36,528
With her...

913
01:08:38,337 --> 01:08:40,771
...on her, what you will.

914
01:08:44,209 --> 01:08:46,006
Lie with her?

915
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,317
Lie on her?

916
01:08:59,391 --> 01:09:01,586
'Zounds, that's fulsome!

917
01:09:45,537 --> 01:09:48,529
Work on, my medicine. Work!

918
01:09:50,575 --> 01:09:53,408
Thus credulous fools are caught.

919
01:09:53,612 --> 01:09:57,309
And many worthy and chaste dames,
even thus...

920
01:09:57,516 --> 01:10:01,179
...all guiltless, meet reproach.

921
01:10:05,657 --> 01:10:07,522
What ho, my lord?

922
01:10:07,959 --> 01:10:09,392
My lord, I say! Othello!

923
01:10:09,594 --> 01:10:11,152
What's the matter?

924
01:10:11,897 --> 01:10:13,296
My lord is in an epilepsy.

925
01:10:13,498 --> 01:10:15,489
This is his second fit.
He had one yesterday.

926
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:17,634
-Rub him about the temples.
-Forbear!

927
01:10:17,836 --> 01:10:20,134
The lethargy
must have his quiet course.

928
01:10:20,338 --> 01:10:23,398
If not, he foams at mouth and
breaks out to savage madness.

929
01:10:23,608 --> 01:10:26,873
Look, he stirs.
Do you withdraw yourself a little.

930
01:10:27,078 --> 01:10:28,807
He will recover straight.

931
01:10:29,014 --> 01:10:33,383
When he is gone, I would
on great occasion speak with you.

932
01:10:35,587 --> 01:10:37,612
How is it, general?

933
01:10:39,558 --> 01:10:41,423
Did he confess it?

934
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:48,566
Have you not hurt your head?

935
01:10:49,167 --> 01:10:50,600
Dost thou mock me?

936
01:10:51,069 --> 01:10:52,764
I mock you?

937
01:10:54,039 --> 01:10:55,063
No, by heaven.

938
01:10:56,141 --> 01:11:00,373
Good sir, whilst you were here,
overwhelmed with your grief...

939
01:11:00,579 --> 01:11:01,773
...Cassio came hither.

940
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:04,175
I shifted him away and
laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy...

941
01:11:04,382 --> 01:11:08,443
...bade him anon return and here speak
with me, the which he promised.

942
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:12,012
Do but encave yourself...

943
01:11:13,358 --> 01:11:16,418
...and mark the jeers, the gibes,
and notable scorns...

944
01:11:16,628 --> 01:11:18,755
...that dwell in
every region of his face.

945
01:11:18,964 --> 01:11:20,955
I will make him tell
the tale anew:

946
01:11:21,166 --> 01:11:24,363
Where, how, how oft,
how long ago...

947
01:11:24,569 --> 01:11:28,972
...and when he hath and is again
to cope your wife.

948
01:11:29,174 --> 01:11:31,904
Marry, patience!

949
01:11:33,044 --> 01:11:36,741
Now, will I question Cassio of Bianca.

950
01:11:36,948 --> 01:11:38,973
He, when he hears of her...

951
01:11:39,184 --> 01:11:41,550
...cannot refrain
from the excess of laughter.

952
01:11:41,753 --> 01:11:43,880
How do you now, lieutenant?

953
01:11:44,356 --> 01:11:45,823
As he shall smile...

954
01:11:46,024 --> 01:11:47,889
...Othello...

955
01:11:48,293 --> 01:11:49,658
...shall go mad.

956
01:11:49,861 --> 01:11:52,489
You give me that same title,
whose want even kills me.

957
01:11:52,697 --> 01:11:56,189
Ply Desdemona well
and you are sure on it.

958
01:11:56,401 --> 01:12:01,338
Now, if this suit
lay in Bianca's power...

959
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:04,172
...how quickly should you speed!

960
01:12:04,376 --> 01:12:07,106
Poor wretch!
I think, in faith, she loves me.

961
01:12:08,513 --> 01:12:10,174
Look how he laughs already!

962
01:12:10,382 --> 01:12:13,510
She says that you shall
marry her. Do you intend it?

963
01:12:13,718 --> 01:12:15,276
I marry her? What?

964
01:12:16,187 --> 01:12:17,950
I prithee, bear
some charity to my wit.

965
01:12:18,156 --> 01:12:21,887
The cry goes that
you shall marry her.

966
01:12:22,093 --> 01:12:24,789
-Prithee, say true.
-I am a very villain else.

967
01:12:25,363 --> 01:12:27,695
This is the monkey's own giving out.

968
01:12:27,899 --> 01:12:31,426
She hangs and lolls and weeps upon me.
So hales....

969
01:12:31,636 --> 01:12:34,764
I see that nose of yours...

970
01:12:34,973 --> 01:12:37,533
...but not that
dog I shall throw it to!

971
01:12:38,743 --> 01:12:41,940
Before me!
Look, where she comes.

972
01:12:43,381 --> 01:12:47,442
How is it with you,
most fair Bianca?

973
01:12:48,086 --> 01:12:50,077
Whence came this?

974
01:12:51,256 --> 01:12:53,850
This is some token from
a newer friend.

975
01:12:54,059 --> 01:12:55,117
No, by my faith.

976
01:12:55,327 --> 01:12:56,419
Why, whose is it?

977
01:12:56,628 --> 01:12:59,461
I know not.
I found it in my chamber.

978
01:13:00,131 --> 01:13:03,123
A likely story that you should
find it in your chamber...

979
01:13:03,335 --> 01:13:05,030
...and not know who left it.

980
01:13:05,236 --> 01:13:06,931
This is some minx's token.

981
01:13:07,706 --> 01:13:08,730
There!

982
01:13:09,207 --> 01:13:12,608
Give it to your hobbyhorse,
wheresoever you had it.

983
01:13:12,811 --> 01:13:15,746
How now, my sweet Bianca!

984
01:13:16,648 --> 01:13:19,048
How now, how now!

985
01:13:21,586 --> 01:13:25,488
If you come to
supper tonight, you may.

986
01:13:26,424 --> 01:13:30,485
If you do not, come
when you are next prepared for.

987
01:13:31,096 --> 01:13:33,189
After her, after her.

988
01:13:33,398 --> 01:13:35,866
Faith, I must.
She'll rail in the streets else.

989
01:13:36,067 --> 01:13:38,092
-Will you sup there?
-I intend to.

990
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:41,170
I may chance to see you, for
I would fain speak with you.

991
01:13:41,373 --> 01:13:44,433
-Prithee, come.
-Go to, say no more.

992
01:13:57,022 --> 01:14:00,219
How shall I murder him, lago?

993
01:14:00,592 --> 01:14:03,618
Did you perceive
how he laughed at his vice?

994
01:14:06,164 --> 01:14:09,600
And did you see the handkerchief?

995
01:14:14,439 --> 01:14:15,633
Damn her!

996
01:14:16,374 --> 01:14:17,932
Lewd minx!

997
01:14:18,276 --> 01:14:19,709
Damn her!

998
01:14:21,212 --> 01:14:23,180
A fine woman, a fair woman,
a sweet woman!

999
01:14:23,381 --> 01:14:24,370
You must forget that.

1000
01:14:24,582 --> 01:14:28,177
Let her perish, and be damned tonight,
for she shall not live.

1001
01:14:28,386 --> 01:14:30,547
No, my heart is turned to stone.

1002
01:14:30,755 --> 01:14:33,815
I strike it,
and it hurts my hand.

1003
01:14:34,492 --> 01:14:38,292
But the pity of it, lago!
O, lago, the pity of it, lago!

1004
01:14:38,496 --> 01:14:39,963
Nay, that's not your way.

1005
01:14:40,165 --> 01:14:41,496
Damn her!

1006
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,532
-Cuckold me?
-O, 'tis foul in her.

1007
01:14:44,736 --> 01:14:47,899
-And with mine officer!
-That's fouler.

1008
01:14:48,106 --> 01:14:51,075
I'd have him nine years a-killing.

1009
01:14:56,448 --> 01:14:58,541
Look here, lago.

1010
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:01,844
All my fond love thus...

1011
01:15:03,521 --> 01:15:07,287
...do I blow to heaven.
'Tis gone.

1012
01:15:10,361 --> 01:15:13,797
Arise, black vengeance, from
thy hollow cell.

1013
01:15:13,998 --> 01:15:18,128
Yield up, O love, thy crown
and hearted throne to tyrannous hate.

1014
01:15:19,637 --> 01:15:23,368
Now, by yond marble heaven...

1015
01:15:23,575 --> 01:15:26,601
...in the due reverence
of a sacred vow...

1016
01:15:26,811 --> 01:15:28,711
...l here engage my words.

1017
01:15:33,184 --> 01:15:36,381
Witness, you ever-burning
lights above...

1018
01:15:36,588 --> 01:15:39,250
...you elements
that clip us round about.

1019
01:15:39,457 --> 01:15:42,551
Witness that here, lago doth give up...

1020
01:15:42,761 --> 01:15:46,197
...the execution of his wit, hands...

1021
01:15:46,798 --> 01:15:47,856
...heart...

1022
01:15:48,299 --> 01:15:50,767
...to wronged Othello's service.

1023
01:15:51,136 --> 01:15:52,899
Let him command.

1024
01:15:53,104 --> 01:15:55,595
And to obey shall be

in me remorse...

1025
01:15:55,807 --> 01:15:58,241
...what bloody business ever.

1026
01:16:17,128 --> 01:16:19,221
I greet thy love.

1027
01:16:23,067 --> 01:16:25,035
Get me some poison,
lago, this night.

1028
01:16:25,236 --> 01:16:27,204
I'll not expostulate with her...

1029
01:16:27,405 --> 01:16:30,272
...lest her body and beauty
unprovide my mind again.

1030
01:16:30,675 --> 01:16:32,870
Do it not with poison.

1031
01:16:33,077 --> 01:16:37,810
Strangle her in her bed,
even the bed she hath contaminated.

1032
01:16:38,016 --> 01:16:42,510
Good, good, the justice of it pleases.
Very good.

1033
01:16:43,621 --> 01:16:44,610
And for Cassio?

1034
01:16:44,823 --> 01:16:47,849
Let me hear thee say,
Michael Cassio is not alive.

1035
01:16:50,261 --> 01:16:54,755
My friend is dead.
You shall know more by midnight.

1036
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:56,656
Excellent. Good.

1037
01:16:57,769 --> 01:16:59,828
Now art thou my lieutenant.

1038
01:17:07,512 --> 01:17:09,912
I am your own...

1039
01:17:10,215 --> 01:17:11,614
...forever.

1040
01:17:19,324 --> 01:17:21,792
God save you, worthy general!

1041
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:23,552
With all my heart, sir.

1042
01:17:23,761 --> 01:17:26,195
The Duke and Senators
of Venice greet you.

1043
01:17:27,365 --> 01:17:31,131
I kiss the instrument of their pleasure.
Welcome, Signor Gratiano.

1044
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:43,540
What's the news, uncle?

1045
01:17:45,650 --> 01:17:48,118
Good cousin Lodovico?

1046
01:17:49,921 --> 01:17:51,445
I am glad to see you, signor.

1047
01:17:51,656 --> 01:17:54,216
-Welcome to Cyprus.
-I thank you.

1048
01:17:54,425 --> 01:17:55,551
How does Lieutenant Cassio?

1049
01:17:58,363 --> 01:18:00,024
Lives, sir.

1050
01:18:00,331 --> 01:18:01,628
Cousin...

1051
01:18:01,866 --> 01:18:06,200
...there's fallen between him and
my lord an unkind breach.

1052
01:18:07,272 --> 01:18:10,207
-But you shall make all well.
-Are you sure of that?

1053
01:18:10,408 --> 01:18:12,876
-My lord?
-"This fail you not to do...."

1054
01:18:13,244 --> 01:18:16,179
He did not call.
Is there division between my lord...

1055
01:18:16,381 --> 01:18:18,372
-...and Cassio?
-A most unhappy one.

1056
01:18:18,583 --> 01:18:22,110
I would do much to atone them,
for the love I bear to Cassio.

1057
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,185
Fire and brimstone!

1058
01:18:24,389 --> 01:18:25,447
My lord?

1059
01:18:25,657 --> 01:18:26,681
Are you wise?

1060
01:18:28,293 --> 01:18:30,727
What? Is he angry?

1061
01:18:30,929 --> 01:18:32,556
Maybe the letter moved him.

1062
01:18:32,764 --> 01:18:35,528
For as I think,
they do command him home...

1063
01:18:35,733 --> 01:18:38,167
...deputing Cassio in his government.

1064
01:18:39,671 --> 01:18:41,263
By my troth, I'm glad on it.

1065
01:18:41,472 --> 01:18:42,734
lndeed!

1066
01:18:45,476 --> 01:18:46,465
My lord?

1067
01:18:46,678 --> 01:18:48,578
I am glad to see you mad.

1068
01:18:49,147 --> 01:18:50,705
Why, sweet Othello?

1069
01:18:50,915 --> 01:18:51,939
Devil!

1070
01:18:58,189 --> 01:18:59,451
I have not deserved this.

1071
01:19:00,725 --> 01:19:04,855
This would not be believed in Venice,
though I should swear I saw it.

1072
01:19:05,496 --> 01:19:08,727
'Tis very much.
Make her amends. She weeps.

1073
01:19:09,133 --> 01:19:13,695
If that the earth could teem with
women's tears, each drop she falls...

1074
01:19:13,905 --> 01:19:15,395
...would prove a crocodile.

1075
01:19:15,606 --> 01:19:17,005
Out of my sight!

1076
01:19:17,742 --> 01:19:20,142
I would not stay to offend you.

1077
01:19:26,017 --> 01:19:28,144
You have seen nothing then?

1078
01:19:28,886 --> 01:19:32,788
-Nor ever heard, nor suspected.
-You've seen Cassio and she together.

1079
01:19:32,991 --> 01:19:36,859
I saw no harm. I heard each syllable
that breath made up between them.

1080
01:19:37,061 --> 01:19:39,154
-What! Did they never whisper?
-Never.

1081
01:19:39,364 --> 01:19:42,663
Nor send you to fetch her fan,
her gloves, her mask, nothing?

1082
01:19:42,867 --> 01:19:44,129
Never.

1083
01:19:44,669 --> 01:19:46,227
That's strange.

1084
01:19:46,437 --> 01:19:50,669
I durst, my lord, to wager she
is honest, lay down my soul at stake.

1085
01:19:52,010 --> 01:19:55,571
If you think other, remove your thought.
It doth abuse your bosom.

1086
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:57,304
Bid her come hither.

1087
01:19:58,116 --> 01:19:59,413
Go!

1088
01:20:01,753 --> 01:20:06,087
She says enough, but she's a simple
bawd that cannot say as much.

1089
01:20:07,625 --> 01:20:10,389
This is a subtle whore.

1090
01:20:11,162 --> 01:20:12,493
But look, she comes.

1091
01:20:14,599 --> 01:20:16,533
What is your pleasure?

1092
01:20:16,734 --> 01:20:18,759
Let me see your eyes.

1093
01:20:19,737 --> 01:20:21,534
Look in my face.

1094
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:24,472
What horrible fancy's this?

1095
01:20:24,675 --> 01:20:27,143
What art thou?

1096
01:20:27,345 --> 01:20:30,143
Your wife, my lord.
Your true and loyal wife.

1097
01:20:30,348 --> 01:20:32,213
Come, swear it.

1098
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:36,653
Damn thyself.

1099
01:20:36,854 --> 01:20:39,152
Swear thou art honest.

1100
01:20:42,727 --> 01:20:44,991
Heaven doth truly know it.

1101
01:20:45,396 --> 01:20:48,593
Heaven truly knows
thou art false as hell.

1102
01:20:49,434 --> 01:20:51,265
T o whom, my lord?

1103
01:20:53,371 --> 01:20:55,066
With whom?

1104
01:20:56,074 --> 01:20:58,201
How am I false?

1105
01:20:58,876 --> 01:21:00,275
O, Desdemona!

1106
01:21:00,478 --> 01:21:02,537
Away, away!

1107
01:21:04,682 --> 01:21:06,377
Alas the heavy day!

1108
01:21:07,151 --> 01:21:08,482
Why do you weep?

1109
01:21:13,291 --> 01:21:16,692
Am I the motive
of these tears, my lord?

1110
01:21:17,228 --> 01:21:20,026
Had it pleased heaven to
try me with affliction...

1111
01:21:20,231 --> 01:21:23,632
...had they rained all kinds
of sores and shames on my bare head...

1112
01:21:23,835 --> 01:21:27,771
...I should have found in some
place of my soul a drop of patience.

1113
01:21:27,972 --> 01:21:31,408
But alas, there, where
I have garnered up my heart...

1114
01:21:31,609 --> 01:21:34,043
... where either I must live
or bear no life...

1115
01:21:34,245 --> 01:21:38,409
... the fountain from the which
my current runs or else dries up...

1116
01:21:38,616 --> 01:21:43,349
... to be discarded or keep as a cistern
for foul toads to knot and gender in!

1117
01:21:43,554 --> 01:21:44,578
O thou...

1118
01:21:45,623 --> 01:21:48,751
...who art so lovely fair...

1119
01:21:49,861 --> 01:21:54,355
...and smells so sweet
that the sense aches at thee.

1120
01:21:56,434 --> 01:21:59,528
Wouldst thou had never been born !

1121
01:22:01,739 --> 01:22:04,902
Alas, what ignorant
sin have I committed?

1122
01:22:05,109 --> 01:22:08,442
Was this fair paper
made to write "whore" upon?

1123
01:22:08,646 --> 01:22:12,207
-What committed! lmpudent strumpet!
-By heaven, you do me wrong.

1124
01:22:12,416 --> 01:22:14,748
-Are you not a strumpet?
-I am a Christian!

1125
01:22:14,952 --> 01:22:16,112
What! Not a whore?

1126
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:18,948
-No, as I shall be saved.
-ls it possible?

1127
01:22:19,690 --> 01:22:21,555
Heaven forgive us!

1128
01:22:23,294 --> 01:22:25,489
I cry you mercy then.

1129
01:22:26,030 --> 01:22:30,797
I took you for that cunning whore of
Venice that married with Othello.

1130
01:22:33,704 --> 01:22:35,171
You, mistress...

1131
01:22:36,174 --> 01:22:39,337
...who have the office opposite
St. Peter and keeps the gate of hell!

1132
01:22:41,579 --> 01:22:43,444
You, you, ay, you!

1133
01:22:46,584 --> 01:22:48,779
We have done our course.

1134
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:52,649
I pray you, turn the key,
and keep our counsel.

1135
01:22:55,159 --> 01:22:57,286
Am I that name, lago?

1136
01:22:57,495 --> 01:23:00,157
What name, fair lady?

1137
01:23:00,431 --> 01:23:02,956
Such as my lord did say I was.

1138
01:23:03,167 --> 01:23:04,964
He called her whore.

1139
01:23:05,369 --> 01:23:06,461
Why did he so?

1140
01:23:07,138 --> 01:23:08,662
I do not know.

1141
01:23:09,307 --> 01:23:11,901
I am sure I am none such.

1142
01:23:13,344 --> 01:23:15,335
Do not weep!

1143
01:23:15,613 --> 01:23:17,137
Do not weep.

1144
01:23:17,348 --> 01:23:19,248
Alas the day!

1145
01:23:19,617 --> 01:23:21,915
Hath she forsook
so many noble matches...

1146
01:23:22,119 --> 01:23:25,111
...her father, her country,
her friends to be called whore?

1147
01:23:25,456 --> 01:23:27,447
Would it not make one weep?

1148
01:23:31,462 --> 01:23:32,861
It is my wretched fortune.

1149
01:23:33,564 --> 01:23:36,089
O, good lago...

1150
01:23:36,801 --> 01:23:40,168
...what shall I do to win my lord again?

1151
01:23:40,905 --> 01:23:42,600
Good friend...

1152
01:23:43,441 --> 01:23:45,033
...go to him...

1153
01:23:45,409 --> 01:23:50,108
...for by this light of heaven,
I know not how I lost him.

1154
01:23:52,550 --> 01:23:53,539
Here I kneel:

1155
01:23:59,457 --> 01:24:02,984
If ever my will did trespass
against his love...

1156
01:24:04,095 --> 01:24:08,828
...either in discourse
of thought or actual deed...

1157
01:24:10,134 --> 01:24:13,467
...or that mine eyes, mine ears...

1158
01:24:14,572 --> 01:24:18,838
...or any sense, delighted
them in any other form...

1159
01:24:20,711 --> 01:24:22,941
...or that I do not yet...

1160
01:24:23,147 --> 01:24:26,344
...and ever did and ever will...

1161
01:24:27,918 --> 01:24:31,376
...though he do shake me
off to beggarly divorcement...

1162
01:24:31,722 --> 01:24:34,156
...love him dearly...

1163
01:24:35,026 --> 01:24:37,688
...comfort forswear me!

1164
01:24:41,332 --> 01:24:43,994
Unkindness may do much...

1165
01:24:44,969 --> 01:24:48,302
...and his unkindness
may defeat my life...

1166
01:24:48,506 --> 01:24:50,599
...but never taint my love.

1167
01:24:54,345 --> 01:24:56,643
I cannot say "whore."

1168
01:24:57,048 --> 01:25:00,074
It does abhor me now
I speak the word.

1169
01:25:00,418 --> 01:25:03,046
To do the act that might
the addition earn...

1170
01:25:03,254 --> 01:25:06,655
...not the world's mass
of vanity could make me!

1171
01:25:06,957 --> 01:25:10,620
I pray you, be content.

1172
01:25:11,595 --> 01:25:13,062
'Tis but his humor:

1173
01:25:13,264 --> 01:25:17,428
The business of the state does him
offense, and he does chide with you.

1174
01:25:17,735 --> 01:25:22,138
-lf it were no other--
-lt is so, I warrant.

1175
01:25:24,475 --> 01:25:27,308
Hark, how these
instruments summon to supper!

1176
01:25:27,511 --> 01:25:30,480
The messengers of Venice stay the meat.

1177
01:25:31,982 --> 01:25:35,247
Go in and weep not.

1178
01:25:35,753 --> 01:25:39,712
All things shall be well.

1179
01:25:55,706 --> 01:25:59,733
-How now, Roderigo?
-Thou deals unjustly with me.

1180
01:25:59,944 --> 01:26:02,879
-What in the contrary?
-Every day thou daffest me.

1181
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:04,809
I will no longer endure it.

1182
01:26:05,015 --> 01:26:09,213
Nor am I persuaded to put up in
peace what already I've suffered.

1183
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:12,981
-Will you hear me?
-Your words and performance are not kin.

1184
01:26:13,190 --> 01:26:16,353
-You charge me most unjustly.
-With nought but truth!

1185
01:26:19,330 --> 01:26:22,925
I will make myself known to Desdemona.

1186
01:26:28,706 --> 01:26:31,834
If she will return me my jewels...

1187
01:26:32,042 --> 01:26:36,376
...l will give over my suit
and repent my unlawful solicitation.

1188
01:26:36,847 --> 01:26:38,337
If not...

1189
01:26:39,950 --> 01:26:44,785
...assure yourself, I will seek
satisfaction of you.

1190
01:26:47,158 --> 01:26:49,023
You have said now.

1191
01:26:49,226 --> 01:26:52,821
Ay, and said nothing but what
I protest intendment of doing.

1192
01:26:53,264 --> 01:26:56,165
Why, now I see...

1193
01:26:57,501 --> 01:26:59,435
...there's mettle in thee.

1194
01:26:59,637 --> 01:27:03,505
And even from now do build on thee
a better opinion than before.

1195
01:27:03,707 --> 01:27:05,641
Give me thy hand, Roderigo.

1196
01:27:06,844 --> 01:27:10,075
Thou hast taken against me a just
exception. Yet, I protest...

1197
01:27:10,281 --> 01:27:13,182
-...I've dealt most justly in thy affair.
-It's not appeared.

1198
01:27:13,384 --> 01:27:16,979
I grant that and your suspicions
are not without wit and judgment.

1199
01:27:17,188 --> 01:27:19,986
But if thou hast
that in thee indeed...

1200
01:27:20,191 --> 01:27:22,284
...which I have greater reason to
believe now...

1201
01:27:22,493 --> 01:27:26,759
...l mean purpose, courage and valor,
this night show it.

1202
01:27:26,964 --> 01:27:31,401
If thou the next night following
enjoy not Desdemona...

1203
01:27:31,602 --> 01:27:36,505
...take me from this world
and devise engines on my life.

1204
01:27:40,411 --> 01:27:41,708
Well...

1205
01:27:44,248 --> 01:27:45,476
...what is it?

1206
01:27:55,926 --> 01:28:00,386
This is the night that either
makes me or fordoes me quite.

1207
01:28:22,786 --> 01:28:24,913
Trouble yourself no further, sir.

1208
01:28:25,122 --> 01:28:28,216
O, pardon me.
It will do me good to walk.

1209
01:28:28,425 --> 01:28:30,120
Desdemona!

1210
01:28:32,229 --> 01:28:35,357
-My lord?
-Get thee to bed on the instant.

1211
01:28:35,566 --> 01:28:38,535
I shall return forthwith.
Dismiss your attendant there.

1212
01:28:39,036 --> 01:28:40,901
Look it be done.

1213
01:28:42,139 --> 01:28:44,073
I will, my lord.

1214
01:28:46,477 --> 01:28:47,739
Madam, good night.

1215
01:28:48,112 --> 01:28:52,708
-I humbly thank your ladyship.
-Your honor is most welcome.

1216
01:28:52,917 --> 01:28:54,441
Will you walk, sir?

1217
01:28:58,055 --> 01:28:59,022
Dismiss me?

1218
01:29:00,124 --> 01:29:01,716
'Twas his bidding.

1219
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:04,193
I would you'd never seen him.

1220
01:29:04,395 --> 01:29:06,192
So would not l!

1221
01:29:13,504 --> 01:29:14,562
Prithee...

1222
01:29:15,372 --> 01:29:17,169
...unpin me here.

1223
01:29:34,825 --> 01:29:39,421
The poor soul sat sighing

1224
01:29:39,997 --> 01:29:43,797
By a sycamore tree

1225
01:29:47,471 --> 01:29:49,598
My mother had a maid called Barbary.

1226
01:29:49,807 --> 01:29:52,708
She was in love
and he she loved proved mad...

1227
01:29:52,910 --> 01:29:54,878
...and did forsake her.

1228
01:29:55,946 --> 01:29:58,278
She had a song of "Willow. "

1229
01:29:59,083 --> 01:30:02,575
An old thing it was,
but it expressed her fortune.

1230
01:30:03,287 --> 01:30:05,721
And she died singing it.

1231
01:30:08,392 --> 01:30:11,555
That song tonight
will not go from my mind.

1232
01:30:13,063 --> 01:30:17,659
The poor soul sat sighing

1233
01:30:18,268 --> 01:30:21,999
By a sycamore tree

1234
01:30:22,539 --> 01:30:26,100
Sing willow, willow, willow

1235
01:30:27,978 --> 01:30:30,970
Her hand on her bosom

1236
01:30:31,181 --> 01:30:33,877
Her head on her knee

1237
01:30:34,585 --> 01:30:38,487
Sing willow, willow, willow

1238
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:47,387
Her salt tears fell from her

1239
01:30:48,565 --> 01:30:52,092
And softened the stones

1240
01:30:54,038 --> 01:30:57,701
Sing willow, willow, willow

1241
01:31:00,711 --> 01:31:03,874
So get thee gone, good night.

1242
01:31:06,150 --> 01:31:09,085
Mine eyes do itch.
Does that bode weeping?

1243
01:31:09,286 --> 01:31:11,015
'Tis neither here nor there.

1244
01:31:11,388 --> 01:31:13,720
I have heard it said so.

1245
01:31:15,092 --> 01:31:16,559
O, these men...

1246
01:31:17,094 --> 01:31:18,823
...these men!

1247
01:31:20,464 --> 01:31:25,026
Dost thou in conscience think,
tell me Emilia, that there be women...

1248
01:31:25,269 --> 01:31:28,170
...do abuse their husbands
in such gross kind?

1249
01:31:28,372 --> 01:31:29,896
There be some, no question.

1250
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:32,504
Wouldst thou do such a deed?

1251
01:31:33,243 --> 01:31:35,643
-Would not you?
-No, by this heavenly light.

1252
01:31:35,846 --> 01:31:37,711
Nor I by this heavenly light.

1253
01:31:37,915 --> 01:31:40,042
I might do it as well in the dark.

1254
01:31:41,185 --> 01:31:44,643
Wouldst thou do
such a deed for all the world?

1255
01:31:45,189 --> 01:31:48,818
The world's a huge thing.
It is a great price for a small vice.

1256
01:31:49,359 --> 01:31:51,156
I think thou wouldst not.

1257
01:31:51,361 --> 01:31:54,728
I think I should
and undo it again when I'd done it.

1258
01:31:55,065 --> 01:31:56,896
For the whole world?

1259
01:31:57,101 --> 01:32:01,367
Who'd not make her husband
a cuckold to make him a monarch?

1260
01:32:01,572 --> 01:32:03,164
I should venture purgatory for it.

1261
01:32:03,373 --> 01:32:05,500
I don't think there
is any such woman.

1262
01:32:05,709 --> 01:32:07,040
Yes...

1263
01:32:08,512 --> 01:32:09,410
...a dozen.

1264
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:13,647
But I do think it is their
husbands' faults if wives do fall.

1265
01:32:14,618 --> 01:32:17,086
Say that they slack their duties...

1266
01:32:17,821 --> 01:32:20,756
...and pour our treasures
into foreign laps.

1267
01:32:21,325 --> 01:32:25,284
Or else break out in peevish jealousies,
throwing restraint upon us.

1268
01:32:25,763 --> 01:32:27,128
Or say they strike us.

1269
01:32:27,865 --> 01:32:29,958
Why, we have galls...

1270
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:34,159
...and though we have some grace,
yet have we some revenge.

1271
01:32:35,472 --> 01:32:39,772
Let husbands know their wives
have sense like them.

1272
01:32:40,577 --> 01:32:42,306
They see and smell...

1273
01:32:42,679 --> 01:32:46,513
...and have their palates both for
sweet and sour as husbands have.

1274
01:32:48,185 --> 01:32:51,211
What is it that they do
when they change us for others?

1275
01:32:51,989 --> 01:32:53,786
Is it sport?

1276
01:32:54,658 --> 01:32:56,353
I think it is.

1277
01:32:56,927 --> 01:32:59,418
And doth affection breed it?

1278
01:33:00,264 --> 01:33:01,993
I think it doth.

1279
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:06,194
Is it frailty that thus errs?

1280
01:33:06,403 --> 01:33:09,429
I think so too.

1281
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:12,165
And have not we affections...

1282
01:33:12,376 --> 01:33:14,970
...desires for sport,
and frailty as men have?

1283
01:33:15,779 --> 01:33:18,145
Then let them use us well.

1284
01:33:18,348 --> 01:33:23,081
Else let them know the ills we do,
their ills instruct us so.

1285
01:33:28,425 --> 01:33:29,255
Good night.

1286
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:40,558
-Be near at hand, I may miscarry in it.
-Here, at thy hand...

1287
01:33:40,771 --> 01:33:44,070
...be bold, and take thy stand.

1288
01:33:50,314 --> 01:33:54,216
'Tis but a man gone.
Forth my sword, he dies!

1289
01:33:54,818 --> 01:33:58,219
If Cassio do remain, he hath a daily
beauty in his life that makes me ugly.

1290
01:33:58,422 --> 01:34:00,652
Besides, he may unfold me to the Moor...

1291
01:34:00,858 --> 01:34:03,952
...there stand I in much peril.
No, he must die.

1292
01:34:18,742 --> 01:34:19,800
Villain, thou diest!

1293
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:28,240
Help, ho!

1294
01:34:29,186 --> 01:34:30,710
O villain that I am!

1295
01:34:32,022 --> 01:34:33,216
Murder! Murder!

1296
01:34:37,094 --> 01:34:38,220
Murder!

1297
01:34:39,296 --> 01:34:42,959
It is some mischance.
The cry is very direful!

1298
01:34:44,101 --> 01:34:45,363
Help!

1299
01:34:46,603 --> 01:34:47,900
O wretched villain!

1300
01:34:50,073 --> 01:34:51,097
Who's there?

1301
01:34:52,342 --> 01:34:55,038
-Who is this that cries on murder?
-We do not know.

1302
01:34:55,245 --> 01:34:56,234
Did you hear a cry?

1303
01:34:56,446 --> 01:34:59,210
Here, for heaven's sake, help me!

1304
01:35:01,885 --> 01:35:03,318
Give me some help.

1305
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:06,284
O, me, lieutenant!
What villains have done this?

1306
01:35:06,490 --> 01:35:09,186
I think one is hereabout
and cannot make away.

1307
01:35:09,393 --> 01:35:10,917
Treacherous villains!

1308
01:35:11,395 --> 01:35:13,920
What are you there?
Come and give some help!

1309
01:35:14,131 --> 01:35:16,258
-O, help me here!
-That's one of them!

1310
01:35:33,417 --> 01:35:36,545
O murderous slave!
O villain!

1311
01:35:42,659 --> 01:35:45,526
O, damned lago.

1312
01:35:47,297 --> 01:35:49,322
lnhuman dog!

1313
01:35:55,405 --> 01:35:59,398
Where be these bloody thieves?
Ho! Murder! Murder!

1314
01:36:59,036 --> 01:37:00,901
It is the cause...

1315
01:37:02,472 --> 01:37:04,770
...it is the cause, my soul.

1316
01:37:06,143 --> 01:37:10,102
Let me not name it to you,
you chaste stars!

1317
01:37:11,481 --> 01:37:13,210
It is the cause.

1318
01:37:15,052 --> 01:37:16,781
Yet I'll not shed her blood...

1319
01:37:16,987 --> 01:37:20,115
...nor scar that whiter skin of hers
than snow...

1320
01:37:20,357 --> 01:37:23,349
...and smooth as monumental alabaster.

1321
01:37:25,796 --> 01:37:27,491
Yet she must die...

1322
01:37:28,999 --> 01:37:31,900
...else she'll betray more men.

1323
01:37:40,510 --> 01:37:42,307
Put out the light...

1324
01:37:45,282 --> 01:37:46,579
...and then...

1325
01:37:47,517 --> 01:37:49,314
...put out the light.

1326
01:38:04,101 --> 01:38:05,568
Who's there?

1327
01:38:21,751 --> 01:38:26,313
O, balmy breath, that doth almost
persuade justice to break her sword!

1328
01:38:43,306 --> 01:38:47,902
Be thus when thou art dead, and
I will kill thee and love thee after.

1329
01:38:52,749 --> 01:38:54,649
One more...

1330
01:38:56,419 --> 01:38:58,546
...and this the last.

1331
01:39:00,824 --> 01:39:03,384
So sweet was never so fatal.

1332
01:39:26,516 --> 01:39:27,642
Othello?

1333
01:39:28,785 --> 01:39:29,809
Ay...

1334
01:39:31,121 --> 01:39:32,418
...Desdemona.

1335
01:39:35,358 --> 01:39:37,451
Will you come to bed, my lord?

1336
01:39:39,930 --> 01:39:43,593
Have you prayed tonight, Desdemona?

1337
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:45,124
Ay, my lord.

1338
01:39:45,835 --> 01:39:47,666
If you bethink yourself of any crime...

1339
01:39:47,871 --> 01:39:50,533
...unreconciled to heaven,
solicit for it straight.

1340
01:39:50,740 --> 01:39:53,470
Alack, my lord, what
may you mean by that?

1341
01:39:53,677 --> 01:39:58,011
Well, do it and be brief.
I will walk by.

1342
01:40:00,317 --> 01:40:02,444
I'll not kill thy unprepared spirit.

1343
01:40:02,652 --> 01:40:04,779
Heaven forfend! I'll not kill thy soul.

1344
01:40:04,988 --> 01:40:07,513
-Talk you of killing?
-Ay, I do.

1345
01:40:08,458 --> 01:40:10,653
Then heaven...

1346
01:40:11,394 --> 01:40:13,328
...have mercy on me.

1347
01:40:13,763 --> 01:40:15,025
Amen...

1348
01:40:15,532 --> 01:40:16,692
...with all my heart!

1349
01:40:16,900 --> 01:40:19,562
If you say so, I hope
you will not kill me.

1350
01:40:20,470 --> 01:40:22,529
And yet I fear you.

1351
01:40:23,073 --> 01:40:24,563
Think on thy sins.

1352
01:40:26,576 --> 01:40:28,100
They are loves I bear to you.

1353
01:40:28,311 --> 01:40:29,608
And for that thou diest.

1354
01:40:29,813 --> 01:40:32,805
That death's unnatural
that kills for loving.

1355
01:40:33,016 --> 01:40:35,246
Peace and be still!

1356
01:40:36,586 --> 01:40:37,883
I will so.

1357
01:40:48,131 --> 01:40:49,564
What's the matter?

1358
01:40:51,067 --> 01:40:54,503
That handkerchief which I gave thee,
thou gave to Cassio.

1359
01:40:54,704 --> 01:40:58,640
No, by my life and soul!
Send for the man and ask him.

1360
01:40:58,842 --> 01:41:03,745
Sweet soul, take heed of perjury.
Thou art on thy deathbed.

1361
01:41:03,947 --> 01:41:04,971
But not yet to die.

1362
01:41:05,181 --> 01:41:06,375
Yes, presently!

1363
01:41:08,351 --> 01:41:10,478
Then Lord have mercy on me!

1364
01:41:10,687 --> 01:41:11,619
I say...

1365
01:41:12,656 --> 01:41:13,714
...amen.

1366
01:41:13,923 --> 01:41:16,153
And have you mercy too!

1367
01:41:16,593 --> 01:41:19,756
I never did offend you in my life.
Never loved Cassio...

1368
01:41:19,963 --> 01:41:23,899
...but with such general warranty
of heaven as I might love.

1369
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:25,124
I never gave him token.

1370
01:41:25,335 --> 01:41:29,066
By heaven, I saw my
handkerchief in his hand!

1371
01:41:29,272 --> 01:41:30,296
He found it then.

1372
01:41:30,507 --> 01:41:32,304
I never gave it him.

1373
01:41:32,842 --> 01:41:33,740
Send for him hither.

1374
01:41:34,210 --> 01:41:35,438
Let him confess a truth.

1375
01:41:35,645 --> 01:41:37,909
He hath confessed.

1376
01:41:38,114 --> 01:41:38,978
What, my lord?

1377
01:41:39,182 --> 01:41:40,979
That he hath used thee.

1378
01:41:41,284 --> 01:41:42,842
How?

1379
01:41:44,287 --> 01:41:48,383
-Unlawfully?
-Ay.

1380
01:41:49,426 --> 01:41:51,326
-He will not say so.
-No...

1381
01:41:52,162 --> 01:41:54,892
...his mouth is stopped.

1382
01:41:55,865 --> 01:41:58,026
Honest lago hath taken order for it.

1383
01:41:59,369 --> 01:42:00,961
What?

1384
01:42:01,805 --> 01:42:03,272
Is he dead?

1385
01:42:05,308 --> 01:42:06,798
Emilia...

1386
01:42:07,644 --> 01:42:10,670
...run and tell my lord and lady
what hath happened.

1387
01:42:18,188 --> 01:42:20,782
Alas, he is betrayed...

1388
01:42:21,591 --> 01:42:24,219
...and I undone.

1389
01:42:24,494 --> 01:42:27,691
Out, strumpet!

1390
01:42:27,897 --> 01:42:31,230
Weepest thou for him to my face?

1391
01:42:33,903 --> 01:42:37,771
O banish me, my lord,
but kill me not!

1392
01:42:41,311 --> 01:42:43,108
Down, strumpet!

1393
01:42:43,313 --> 01:42:45,110
lKill me tomorrow.

1394
01:42:51,688 --> 01:42:53,588
Let me live tonight.

1395
01:42:58,361 --> 01:42:59,350
Nay!

1396
01:43:04,134 --> 01:43:06,125
If you strive....

1397
01:43:17,247 --> 01:43:18,874
But half an hour!

1398
01:43:21,050 --> 01:43:24,213
-Being done, there is no pause.
-But while I say one prayer!

1399
01:43:24,421 --> 01:43:25,547
It's too late.

1400
01:44:24,214 --> 01:44:26,614
What? Not dead?

1401
01:44:28,151 --> 01:44:29,880
Not yet quite dead?

1402
01:44:30,086 --> 01:44:32,919
Good my lord, I would
speak a word with you.

1403
01:44:34,824 --> 01:44:36,416
Who's there?

1404
01:44:36,626 --> 01:44:40,323
I do beseech you that I may speak
with you, O, good my lord.

1405
01:44:44,634 --> 01:44:46,499
Yes, Emilia.

1406
01:44:46,703 --> 01:44:48,330
By and by.

1407
01:44:50,573 --> 01:44:54,942
-What is the matter with thee?
-My good lord, yonder's foul murder done.

1408
01:44:55,144 --> 01:44:56,975
-What, now?
-But now, my lord.

1409
01:44:57,180 --> 01:44:59,375
It is the very error of the moon.

1410
01:44:59,582 --> 01:45:02,380
She comes nearer earth than she
was wont and makes men mad.

1411
01:45:02,752 --> 01:45:05,118
Cassio hath killed
a Venetian called Roderigo.

1412
01:45:05,788 --> 01:45:07,585
Roderigo and Cassio killed?

1413
01:45:07,790 --> 01:45:11,658
-No, Cassio's not killed.
-Not Cassio killed!

1414
01:45:11,861 --> 01:45:15,592
Then murder's out of tune,
and sweet revenge grows harsh.

1415
01:45:16,933 --> 01:45:18,230
What cry is that?

1416
01:45:18,434 --> 01:45:19,264
That? What?

1417
01:45:19,469 --> 01:45:22,165
Out, and alas,
that was my lady's voice!

1418
01:45:29,112 --> 01:45:30,739
O lady, speak again!

1419
01:45:30,947 --> 01:45:34,041
Sweet Desdemona!
O sweet mistress, speak!

1420
01:45:48,298 --> 01:45:50,391
O, who has done this deed?

1421
01:45:51,701 --> 01:45:53,032
'Twas I that killed her.

1422
01:45:55,738 --> 01:45:57,865
She turned to folly
and she was a whore.

1423
01:45:58,274 --> 01:46:00,640
Thou dost belie her
and thou art a devil.

1424
01:46:00,843 --> 01:46:03,107
She was false as water.

1425
01:46:03,313 --> 01:46:07,374
Thou art rash as fire to say that she
was false. She was heavenly true!

1426
01:46:07,584 --> 01:46:10,849
Cassio did top her!
Ask thy husband else.

1427
01:46:11,254 --> 01:46:14,189
I were damned beneath hell,
but that I did proceed...

1428
01:46:14,390 --> 01:46:16,915
...justly to this extremity.
Thy husband knew.

1429
01:46:17,260 --> 01:46:19,455
-My husband?
-Thy husband.

1430
01:46:19,696 --> 01:46:20,856
That she was false?

1431
01:46:21,064 --> 01:46:23,032
With Cassio.
Nay, had she been true--

1432
01:46:23,232 --> 01:46:25,530
-My husband?
-Ay, 'twas he that told me.

1433
01:46:25,735 --> 01:46:27,635
An honest man who hates the slime...

1434
01:46:27,870 --> 01:46:30,600
-...that sticks on filthy deeds.
-My husband?

1435
01:46:30,807 --> 01:46:33,674
What needs this iterance, woman?
I say thy husband!

1436
01:46:33,876 --> 01:46:38,245
If he say so, may his pernicious
soul rot half a grain a day!

1437
01:46:38,448 --> 01:46:40,609
He lies to the heart.

1438
01:46:41,117 --> 01:46:43,347
She was too fond
of her filthy bargain.

1439
01:46:43,553 --> 01:46:44,451
Do thy worst.

1440
01:46:44,654 --> 01:46:48,351
This deed of thine is no more worthy
heaven than thou wast worthy her.

1441
01:46:48,558 --> 01:46:50,651
Help! Murder!

1442
01:46:51,427 --> 01:46:52,257
Peace...

1443
01:46:52,829 --> 01:46:54,057
...you were best.

1444
01:46:54,263 --> 01:46:57,391
Thou hast not half the power to
harm me as I have to be hurt.

1445
01:46:57,634 --> 01:46:58,999
O gull!

1446
01:46:59,202 --> 01:47:04,139
O dolt! As ignorant as dirt!
Thou hast done a deed.

1447
01:47:04,707 --> 01:47:06,436
I care not for thy sword.

1448
01:47:06,643 --> 01:47:10,079
I'll make thee known
though I lost twenty lives.

1449
01:47:10,279 --> 01:47:12,042
Help! Help!

1450
01:47:12,248 --> 01:47:14,842
The Moor hath killed my mistress!

1451
01:47:15,051 --> 01:47:17,349
Murder! Murder!

1452
01:47:18,054 --> 01:47:19,043
Murder!

1453
01:47:19,822 --> 01:47:21,187
How now, general?

1454
01:47:21,391 --> 01:47:23,086
Who cries of murder?

1455
01:47:24,994 --> 01:47:26,518
O, are you come, lago?

1456
01:47:26,729 --> 01:47:29,596
You've done well, that men lay
their murders on your neck.

1457
01:47:29,799 --> 01:47:31,926
Disprove this villain,
if thou be a man.

1458
01:47:32,135 --> 01:47:34,695
He says thou toldest him
that his wife is false.

1459
01:47:34,904 --> 01:47:38,635
Thou art not such a villain.
Speak, for my heart is full.

1460
01:47:38,841 --> 01:47:40,399
I told him what I thought...

1461
01:47:40,610 --> 01:47:44,068
...and told no more than what he
found himself was apt and true.

1462
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:47,249
-But did you tell him she was false?
-I did.

1463
01:47:47,450 --> 01:47:49,179
You told a lie...

1464
01:47:49,519 --> 01:47:53,046
...an odious, damned lie.
Upon my a soul, a lie, a wicked lie!

1465
01:47:53,256 --> 01:47:55,190
She false with Cassio?
Did you say--?

1466
01:47:55,391 --> 01:47:57,291
With Cassio.
Go to, charm your tongue.

1467
01:47:57,660 --> 01:48:00,652
I will not charm my tongue.
I am bound to speak.

1468
01:48:00,897 --> 01:48:03,661
My mistress here lies
murdered in her bed.

1469
01:48:07,203 --> 01:48:09,000
Your reports have set the murder on.

1470
01:48:09,405 --> 01:48:12,033
Nay, stare not, masters.

1471
01:48:12,642 --> 01:48:15,702
It is true indeed.

1472
01:48:16,512 --> 01:48:17,536
Villainy...

1473
01:48:17,747 --> 01:48:20,045
...villainy, villainy!

1474
01:48:20,249 --> 01:48:21,375
I think upon it...

1475
01:48:22,251 --> 01:48:25,379
...l think, I smell it, O villainy!

1476
01:48:25,722 --> 01:48:29,283
What? Are you mad?
I charge you, get you home.

1477
01:48:29,492 --> 01:48:31,585
Good gentlemen, let me
have leave to speak.

1478
01:48:32,462 --> 01:48:34,896
'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.

1479
01:48:35,465 --> 01:48:37,399
Perchance I will never go home.

1480
01:48:39,902 --> 01:48:40,732
Nay...

1481
01:48:41,604 --> 01:48:44,835
...lay thee down and roar!

1482
01:48:45,041 --> 01:48:48,272
Thou has killed the sweetest
innocent that ever did lift up eye.

1483
01:48:48,478 --> 01:48:51,606
O, she was foul!
lago knows that she with Cassio...

1484
01:48:51,814 --> 01:48:54,408
...hath the act of shame
a thousand times committed.

1485
01:48:54,617 --> 01:48:58,178
Cassio confessed, and she gratified his
amorous works with that handkerchief.

1486
01:48:58,387 --> 01:49:00,514
I saw it in his hand.

1487
01:49:03,526 --> 01:49:05,050
O God!

1488
01:49:07,396 --> 01:49:09,193
O heavenly God!

1489
01:49:11,501 --> 01:49:13,469
Be wise...

1490
01:49:14,370 --> 01:49:16,395
...and get you home.

1491
01:49:17,673 --> 01:49:19,800
I will not.

1492
01:49:22,044 --> 01:49:23,306
O thou dull Moor!

1493
01:49:24,814 --> 01:49:29,114
That handkerchief thou
speakest of I found by fortune...

1494
01:49:30,086 --> 01:49:31,383
...and did give my husband.

1495
01:49:31,587 --> 01:49:33,111
Filth...

1496
01:49:33,322 --> 01:49:34,152
...thou liest!

1497
01:49:34,357 --> 01:49:37,326
By heaven, I do not.
I do not, gentlemen. I found it!

1498
01:49:38,161 --> 01:49:41,756
Are there no stones in heaven
but what serves for thunder?

1499
01:49:42,799 --> 01:49:44,494
Precious villain!

1500
01:49:59,315 --> 01:50:01,010
Stop, villain!

1501
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:06,013
Lay me by my mistress' side.

1502
01:50:44,961 --> 01:50:47,657
What did thy song bode, lady?

1503
01:50:48,497 --> 01:50:50,761
Hark, canst thou hear me?

1504
01:50:51,701 --> 01:50:54,966
I will play the swan and die in music.

1505
01:50:56,205 --> 01:50:58,070
Willow...

1506
01:50:58,274 --> 01:51:00,572
... willow, willow

1507
01:51:01,611 --> 01:51:04,774
Moor, she was chaste.

1508
01:51:04,981 --> 01:51:07,916
She loved thee, cruel Moor.

1509
01:51:10,219 --> 01:51:12,983
So come my soul to bliss...

1510
01:51:13,623 --> 01:51:15,318
...as I speak true.

1511
01:51:16,025 --> 01:51:19,188
So speaking as I think, I die...

1512
01:51:20,630 --> 01:51:22,564
...l die.

1513
01:51:26,102 --> 01:51:28,935
Where is this rash
and most unfortunate man?

1514
01:51:32,074 --> 01:51:34,474
That's he that was Othello.

1515
01:51:37,980 --> 01:51:39,379
Here I am.

1516
01:51:40,449 --> 01:51:41,780
Where is that viper?

1517
01:51:42,351 --> 01:51:44,546
Bring the villain forth.

1518
01:51:53,896 --> 01:51:56,763
I look down towards his feet...

1519
01:51:57,967 --> 01:52:00,094
...but that's a fable.

1520
01:52:00,603 --> 01:52:02,764
If that thou be a devil...

1521
01:52:03,272 --> 01:52:05,103
...l cannot kill thee.

1522
01:52:21,357 --> 01:52:25,726
I bleed, sir...

1523
01:52:25,928 --> 01:52:27,452
...but not killed.

1524
01:52:28,030 --> 01:52:30,624
I am not sorry neither.

1525
01:52:31,167 --> 01:52:33,397
I'd have thee live.

1526
01:52:33,602 --> 01:52:36,366
For in my sense...

1527
01:52:36,572 --> 01:52:39,666
...'tis happiness to die.

1528
01:52:39,875 --> 01:52:41,433
This wretch...

1529
01:52:41,644 --> 01:52:44,670
...hath part confessed his villainy.

1530
01:52:46,716 --> 01:52:49,685
Did you and he consent...

1531
01:52:49,885 --> 01:52:52,080
...in Cassio's death?

1532
01:52:53,089 --> 01:52:54,579
Ay.

1533
01:52:56,392 --> 01:52:58,690
Dear general, I never gave you cause.

1534
01:52:58,894 --> 01:53:02,261
I do believe it and ask your pardon.

1535
01:53:03,699 --> 01:53:05,758
Will you, I pray...

1536
01:53:05,968 --> 01:53:08,198
...demand this demi-devil...

1537
01:53:08,804 --> 01:53:12,638
...why he hath thus ensnared
my soul and body?

1538
01:53:13,642 --> 01:53:16,440
Demand me nothing.

1539
01:53:17,980 --> 01:53:19,845
What you know, you know.

1540
01:53:21,384 --> 01:53:23,284
From this time forth...

1541
01:53:23,619 --> 01:53:26,645
...l never will speak word.

1542
01:53:28,524 --> 01:53:30,048
Well...

1543
01:53:31,293 --> 01:53:33,454
...thou dost best.

1544
01:53:35,798 --> 01:53:37,698
Forsake this room and go with us.

1545
01:53:37,900 --> 01:53:39,834
Your power and command is taken off...

1546
01:53:40,469 --> 01:53:43,165
...and Cassio rules in Cyprus.

1547
01:53:53,049 --> 01:53:54,744
Come, bring him away.

1548
01:53:55,051 --> 01:53:56,450
A word before you go.

1549
01:53:56,852 --> 01:53:59,878
I have done the state
some service, and they know it.

1550
01:54:13,536 --> 01:54:15,561
No more of that.

1551
01:54:20,643 --> 01:54:22,235
I pray you...

1552
01:54:22,845 --> 01:54:25,871
...in your letters, when you
these unlucky deeds relate...

1553
01:54:26,415 --> 01:54:28,246
...speak of me as I am.

1554
01:54:28,684 --> 01:54:30,845
Nothing extenuate...

1555
01:54:31,053 --> 01:54:33,544
...nor set down aught in malice.

1556
01:54:34,223 --> 01:54:37,351
Then must you speak of one...

1557
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:40,552
...that loved not wisely,
but too well.

1558
01:54:40,763 --> 01:54:45,132
Of one not easily jealous,
but being wrought...

1559
01:54:45,334 --> 01:54:48,235
...perplexed in the extreme.

1560
01:54:49,004 --> 01:54:52,371
Of one whose hand,
like the base lndian...

1561
01:54:52,575 --> 01:54:56,136
...threw a pearl away
richer than all his tribe.

1562
01:54:57,146 --> 01:54:59,740
Of one whose subdued eyes...

1563
01:54:59,949 --> 01:55:03,612
...albeit unused to the melting mood...

1564
01:55:03,819 --> 01:55:08,051
...drop tears as fast as
the Arabian trees...

1565
01:55:08,257 --> 01:55:09,952
...their medicinal gum.

1566
01:55:13,262 --> 01:55:15,059
Set you down this.

1567
01:55:16,132 --> 01:55:18,396
And say, besides...

1568
01:55:19,835 --> 01:55:21,826
...that in Aleppo once...

1569
01:55:23,005 --> 01:55:26,668
...where a malignant
and a turbanned Turk...

1570
01:55:26,876 --> 01:55:28,776
...beat a Venetian...

1571
01:55:29,178 --> 01:55:31,476
...and traduced the state...

1572
01:55:32,448 --> 01:55:35,849
...l took by the throat...

1573
01:55:36,051 --> 01:55:38,417
...the circumcised dog...

1574
01:55:39,155 --> 01:55:40,588
...and smote him...

1575
01:55:42,558 --> 01:55:43,786
...thus.

1576
01:56:25,501 --> 01:56:27,662
I kissed thee...

1577
01:56:27,870 --> 01:56:30,395
...ere I killed thee.

1578
01:56:31,674 --> 01:56:34,142
No way but this...

1579
01:56:35,611 --> 01:56:37,977
...killing myself...

1580
01:56:38,747 --> 01:56:42,239
...to die upon a kiss.

1581
01:56:49,325 --> 01:56:52,954
This I did fear, but thought
he had no weapon.

1582
01:56:53,562 --> 01:56:55,553
For he was great of heart.

1583
01:56:55,764 --> 01:56:57,857
O Spartan dog!

1584
01:57:00,903 --> 01:57:03,736
Look on the tragic
loading of this bed.

1585
01:57:04,607 --> 01:57:06,438
This is thy work.

1586
01:57:16,185 --> 01:57:18,153
T o you, lord governor...

1587
01:57:18,354 --> 01:57:21,949
...remains the censure
of this hellish villain.

1588
01:57:22,758 --> 01:57:24,225
The time...

1589
01:57:25,227 --> 01:57:26,694
...the place...

1590
01:57:28,163 --> 01:57:30,393
...the torture.
O, enforce it!

1591
01:57:33,936 --> 01:57:36,200
Myself will straight aboard...

1592
01:57:37,206 --> 01:57:39,606
...and to the state...

1593
01:57:39,808 --> 01:57:41,503
...this heavy act...

1594
01:57:42,278 --> 01:57:44,712
...with heavy heart relate.
