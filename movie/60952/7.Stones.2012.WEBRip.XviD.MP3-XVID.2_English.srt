1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,940
(VOICEOVER): I know
revenge for his murder

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:08,240
will give me some
shred of my life back.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,580
Make me feel decent again.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,150
Like walking into a
room, finding my old self

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,550
tucked away in a drawer,
waiting for the light.

6
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,840
-Before when I was scared,
I used to remind myself

7
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,250
that I was a reporter and
they don't kill us easily.

8
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,850
We know people right?

9
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,180
But it wasn't enough.

10
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,700
The government crumbled.

11
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,260
I couldn't control my fear.

12
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:11,760
So I cooperated.

13
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,450
The way that scared people do.

14
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,620
I wrote what they wanted.

15
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,460
Sent innocent men to prison.

16
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,640
I played ball.

17
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,550
Now the monster I helped
create has sentenced me to die.

18
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,780
-But first I'm
going to kill a man.

19
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:22,230
He killed the one decent
thing I still looked up to.

20
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,490
-I know you.

21
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,540
-It's all right.

22
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,220
-You won't be here for long.

23
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,370
-No one ever is.

24
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,350
-Good.

25
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:58,330
You made it.

26
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,330
Now remember your promise.

27
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,790
-A boy.

28
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,270
A simple boy who
wouldn't cooperate.

29
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,470
-(WHISPERING) Who's this?

30
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,380
-I've made a promise
to avenge his murder

31
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,720
and it's the one promise
I'm going to keep.

32
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,570
For revenge is all I have left.

33
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,460
-Is there any water?

34
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,510
-One's supposed to be yours?

35
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,610
-What am I supposed
to do with it?

36
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,280
-He likes you.

37
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,160
-Who?

38
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,860
-Elias.

39
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,730
-Elias is going to
like a lot less of me.

40
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,110
He's gonna wish he
never heard my name.

41
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,140
-Good.

42
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,480
Then you won't mind.

43
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,480
My guess is they don't feed you.

44
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,980
-Give me that rabbit!

45
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,990
-This is probably easier.

46
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,440
That how they punish people
who are already in solitary?

47
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,750
Huh?

48
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,560
No food?

49
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,400
I suppose I ask for
another potato from now on.

50
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,100
-No!

51
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,570
-Because they don't
know you're here.

52
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,410
If it's one potato a day,
both of us won't last.

53
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,690
-I've survived a year.

54
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,920
Elias he brought you that.

55
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,620
Why?

56
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:19,260
I mean he's cunning.

57
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,990
Brilliant actually.

58
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,310
If he wasn't a psychopath.

59
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,910
He wants to control you.

60
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,090
You've gotta show him that
it doesn't mean anything.

61
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:38,930
Give me the rabbit and I'll
tell you how to survive in here.

62
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,310
-What's this?

63
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:43,450
-- It's
in the ceiling.

64
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,090
See, they're all
held up by the weight

65
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,960
of each one pressing
against the other.

66
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,190
There.

67
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,420
Now we need seven of them.

68
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,360
-And the ceiling collapses
and then we're killed.

69
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,320
Good plan.

70
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,020
-No.

71
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,160
A controlled collapse.

72
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,530
One at a time.

73
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,950
You can help me.

74
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,910
Yeah.

75
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,110
-I'm busy.

76
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,580
-You're busy huh?

77
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,520
Do you know why no
one escapes from here?

78
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,010
Huh?

79
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:30,450
Last year when the rains came
this entire prison flooded.

80
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:36,030
Every cell, every man,
waist deep in water.

81
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,780
No sleep.

82
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,670
No food.

83
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,280
And snakes.

84
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,130
And .

85
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,910
See they're smart.

86
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:54,860
Somehow they know, they know
to wait until the men are week.

87
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,310
-You're lying.

88
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,290
-Yeah.

89
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:01,790
I stay up here on
this beam and I

90
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,720
watch the water get
higher and higher.

91
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,910
See it comes in under
that wall first.

92
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,520
It starts a couple
inches, then a foot.

93
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,370
Then three feet and four feet.

94
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,680
It keeps getting higher.

95
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,970
And higher.

96
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,890
And the rain keeps
coming day after day.

97
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,490
Almost like God is still
rehearsing that ark thing.

98
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,990
Then they stop feeding us.

99
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:45,250
And you can hear the cries
of the men asking for food.

100
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,240
Then there's the quiet.

101
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,760
And the snakes, they gorge.

102
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,700
I saw it.

103
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,060
I saw the constrictors--

104
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:00,760
-Stop it!

105
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,840
-In the future why don't you
try to draw the least amount

106
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,360
of attention to this cell,
do you understand me?

107
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,720
See I was lucky to find food.

108
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,190
I was lucky to have
this cell to hide in.

109
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:26,030
I was lucky enough to find this.

110
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,730
Seven stones.

111
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:34,020
And the whole
ceiling comes down.

112
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,670
-So your escape is to
tear this place down?

113
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,530
-I want this place to die!

114
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,580
-All the men that have been
killed year after year.

115
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:53,270
-Destroying the one cell isn't
going to tear this prison down.

116
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,120
-OK.

117
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,490
So maybe it's a
little symbolic OK?

118
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,200
My wife.

119
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,690
She always said I was
a little grandiose.

120
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,160
But I'm getting out.

121
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,930
-You're not the only
one with a plan.

122
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,710
-I'd be a fool to trust you.

123
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:22,110
-I could kill you.

124
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:22,910
-Nice try.

125
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,150
But I'm already dead.

126
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:33,220
So did you ever hate someone?

127
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:40,040
So completely.

128
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,330
So fully.

129
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,140
That killing him would
trigger as much remorse

130
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,750
as accidentally
stepping on an ant?

131
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,380
-Well you said accidentally.

132
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,510
Maybe I would have thought
that you were hopeless.

133
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,330
-And you realized?

134
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,670
You're no longer
capable of remorse.

135
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,700
So you're just like him.

136
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,160
You act so tough.

137
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,110
-What did you do to
get thrown in here?

138
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,440
-I've become dangerous.

139
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,070
-And you said that you
were here to kill someone?

140
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:20,770
Who?

141
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,330
-I'm here to kill Elias.

142
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:31,050
- Right.

143
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:00,710
-No!

144
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,960
I'll get food for you.

145
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,410
Please don't kill him.

146
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,260
I'm tired of everything dying.

147
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,930
-Well then I suggest
that you don't listen.

148
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,550
Or you could forget
about Elias and help me.

149
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,630
-I didn't come here to help you!

150
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:41,770
-I didn't come here
to eat this rabbit.

151
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:45,760
What happened to I'm
tired of everything dying?

152
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,540
-What  do you
have to get back to, huh?

153
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,880
By the time you get thrown
in here you got nothing left.

154
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,300
-That's not true.

155
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,290
See, I was a writer.

156
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:01,620
You can't take
that away from me.

157
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,020
-Yes they can.

158
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,960
-See.

159
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,900
I wrote children's stories.

160
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,570
But the government, they
thought it was subversive.

161
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,910
I refused to write
their version of what

162
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:19,000
a children's story should be.

163
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,710
When politics go bad eventually
we all become prisoners.

164
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,700
-Even authors of
children's books.

165
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:37,310
Anyway you would have
eventually gotten into trouble.

166
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,020
Everybody did.

167
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,260
-So what did you do out there?

168
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,530
You don't look
like a subversive.

169
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,860
You don't have the look.

170
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,260
-Anything but.

171
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,220
Opposition to the
political party.

172
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,710
-No.

173
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:57,670
-You're going to have
to help me out here.

174
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,650
-School teacher.

175
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:04,110
I was a school teacher.

176
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:07,510
-So you saw these boys
disappearing first hand.

177
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,900
Boys being turned into soldiers.

178
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:15,870
Being taught how to kill, and
you just had to do something.

179
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:19,380
-You must have been
watching me the whole time.

180
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,880
-You don't know Elias.

181
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,220
He's smart.

182
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,910
That's how he survived
in the shark tank.

183
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:31,460
The only thing these
boys understand is power.

184
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,510
It's about who has it.

185
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,210
Who doesn't.

186
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,230
-Elias doesn't understand
justice either.

187
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,150
He will.

188
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,340
-I need to find my son.

189
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,640
-I lived in this
aided community.

190
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,890
community.

191
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:15,380
Anyway, the whole time
there was this boy.

192
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,650
This homeless kid.

193
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,290
Always .

194
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,840
He never bothered me.

195
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,430
-When was this?

196
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,670
-Things were bad.

197
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,120
Boys started showing
up with guns.

198
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,870
I saw them kill.

199
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,670
My boy wouldn't kill.

200
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,040
Then I saw him.

201
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,460
I saw him.

202
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,400
I knew they were being used.

203
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,710
I knew I .

204
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,210
-How did you help?

205
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,210
-I knew he disappeared.

206
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:05,710
Then I saw him.

207
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:09,210
He wouldn't cooperate.

208
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:12,030
Wouldn't kill.

209
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,700
So they killed him.

210
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:21,590
I saw his head on
the end of a pole.

211
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,950
Warning the other boys.

212
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,970
And then I found out
Elias killed him.

213
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,330
-Elias?

214
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,620
He killed my son?

215
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:49,660
And they dragged
me here a year ago?

216
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,580
I didn't get to say goodbye.

217
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:58,300
My son was at school.

218
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,050
-It wasn't your son.

219
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,330
-How do you know that?

220
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:08,610
How do you know anything?

221
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,550
-Listen to me.

222
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:14,940
I'm Laura Brummels.

223
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,880
-You're not a school teacher.

224
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,810
You're the reporter.

225
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,560
-There has to be a God.

226
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,860
Because who else would turn
things like this on me?

227
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,580
I lied awake night after night.

228
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,320
Why didn't I do something?

229
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,030
Why did I cooperate?

230
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:46,780
I'm like everyone else hoping
things would get better.

231
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,260
Hoping just a bit more.

232
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,730
-You're the one
who sent me here!

233
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,710
Why should I believe
anything you say?

234
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,840
-Because I'm here now too!

235
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,540
-Ah!

236
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,210
-It was your choice to
leave the way you did.

237
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,520
I didn't chase you down.

238
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,190
I didn't go after you until
I was directly ordered to.

239
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,190
I knew all along you were
leading the opposition.

240
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:15,100
I kept my mouth shut.

241
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,530
And then you wrote
that stupid book!

242
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:22,230
Children don't pick up
books to learn politics.

243
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,240
-They wanted to know why
people were disappearing!

244
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,390
I thought that it
would be brave.

245
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,700
-How's that working for you?

246
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,720
Your book is no where,
and you're here.

247
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,770
-Better life for my son.

248
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,920
-What do you think
his life is like now?

249
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,000
You've been here over year!

250
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,400
Everything.

251
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,330
Your house.

252
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,260
Your wife.

253
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,050
All of it's gone!

254
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,860
-She resisted you!

255
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,280
Yeah.

256
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:12,070
-I'm getting out of here.

257
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:15,030
I don't need your help.

258
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:18,480
The rains are going to come.

259
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,000
You think you're tough.

260
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,340
The strongest swimmers drown.

261
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:22,830
-Clear out.

262
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,790
Where's your little friend?

263
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:50,280
-Who?

264
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:55,270
-The one I gave you.

265
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:58,770
You see.

266
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:03,260
I gave you a pet in
contemplation of friendship.

267
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,250
-Why be friends with me?

268
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:20,220
-It was a gift!

269
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:24,720
Why don't you want to
be friends with me?

270
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:39,940
-Hell of a consolation.

271
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,940
-You would have killed him.

272
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:49,210
-You would have
under the opposition.

273
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,710
Seven stones.

274
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,680
You're a fool.

275
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,600
The only rocks in this
place are in your head!

276
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,530
And I wonder who's
going to go to hell.

277
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:02,010
Hey!

278
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,460
Hey!

279
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:10,350
I want someone in here with me!

280
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,830
-Bitch!

281
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,050
-They're going to kill you.

282
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,410
-What am I the one
that you came to kill?

283
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,890
Is that it?

284
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:40,000
-Bring me a .

285
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:51,050
-There's going to
be a prison break.

286
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:53,830
All of you are going to die.

287
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,530
Including Elias.

288
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:58,490
-I doubt anything
could kill Elias.

289
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,480
-Perhaps?

290
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,960
But if they try and he survives.

291
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,940
You knew about it.

292
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,170
-Damn right there's going
to be a prison break.

293
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,640
He's crazy you know that?

294
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,350
He probably played
with scissors as a kid.

295
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,930
If you think that you're
going to lure him in here

296
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:51,370
and then yell to me to help,
you can forget about it.

297
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,470
-Yeah, I got that idea
about you last night.

298
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,860
-I gotta get out of here.

299
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,650
That's right.

300
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:02,880
You're late for a revolution.

301
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,800
You don't want to
ruin your plan.

302
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,800
So you sacrificed me.

303
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,800
-I would do anything
to see my son.

304
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:18,000
-Everything you're doing you're
doing because you hate me.

305
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,860
-I did something to you?

306
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:25,160
My son is God knows
where and lonely.

307
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,540
And you put me here!

308
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,970
You got something on your
mind but it's not hate.

309
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:38,770
-You want me to die?

310
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:39,760
OK.

311
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,260
I'm going to die.

312
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:46,550
But on my way out,
I'm going to fix this.

313
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,370
Make one thing right!

314
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:58,100
- Help me.

315
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,520
You don't want to die here.

316
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:33,720
-What are you doing?

317
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,240
Making friends?

318
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,870
You didn't come here for that.

319
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:41,280
You have to do this.

320
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,260
You have to kill him.

321
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,760
He deserves it.

322
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,250
He killed me!

323
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:56,220
-Shh.

324
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,210
You made a promise.

325
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,960
-Calm down.

326
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,650
-- If
that's what you want.

327
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:48,890
-OK.

328
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,610
-You're so strong.

329
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:03,070
I used to admire you.

330
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:08,140
You gave the boys
a sense of home.

331
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:08,830
Belonging.

332
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:14,790
Nobody ever thanked
you for that.

333
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,550
And sometimes, they didn't obey.

334
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:30,620
So you had to
discipline them, right?

335
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,460
Otherwise.

336
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:37,320
-Otherwise

337
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,750
-You'd have nothing.

338
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,200
Like what you have now.

339
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:47,470
-Nothing.

340
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,260
-You feel it.

341
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,160
-They're afraid of me.

342
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,610
-No.

343
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:08,060
They just hate you.

344
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,040
I hate you.

345
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,020
For what you did.

346
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,500
And who you are.

347
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:28,140
-The other boys tell me stories
of how their dad beat them.

348
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:31,200
How their mothers
would put their hands

349
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,030
in boiling water as punishment.

350
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,390
And they're filled
with rage and anger.

351
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:42,610
And I can't stop feeling.

352
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:51,860
I don't feel sorry for them.

353
00:34:51,860 --> 00:35:00,930
It feels good.

354
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:07,860
When their stories are bad it's
good that whatever happened

355
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,010
to them makes them
perfect for me.

356
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:22,220
I'm just as bad as they are now.

357
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,670
Worse.

358
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,650
-And you're feeling lonely.

359
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:39,110
-My parents were loving.

360
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:43,090
I got everything.

361
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,090
They never hit me.

362
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,560
What the hell happened?

363
00:35:56,540 --> 00:36:00,280
But I am going to enjoy
every second of this.

364
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,050
I know this won't last.

365
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:19,530
Power this great can never last.

366
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,250
This is my time.

367
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,390
-You're evil.

368
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:30,960
-You don't think I
know what you did?

369
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,860
I know who you were.

370
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,220
-I did this to survive.

371
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:41,520
You did this to keep your home.

372
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,400
Your lifestyle.

373
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,730
That's what you wanted.

374
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:52,070
You put men in
here to keep that.

375
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,680
-You killed a boy!

376
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:00,000
-There will probably be more.

377
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:06,790
This ain't over.

378
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:13,890
But you're evil just like
me, which makes you perfect.

379
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:17,630
Don't you think?

380
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,320
Ah!

381
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,440
-Ah!

382
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:48,250
-You did it.

383
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,620
He deserved it.

384
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,750
Nobody's ever defended me.

385
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,450
Ever.

386
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,910
-No.

387
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:04,860
(CRYING) He's killed my friend.

388
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:08,820
-You killed him for me.

389
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,800
-No.

390
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,140
I killed him for you.

391
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:37,470
- Which one?

392
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,470
Help me.

393
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,250
(VOICEOVER): Seven.

394
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:47,950
Seven.

395
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,320
-Ugh!

396
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:40,390
(VOICEOVER): I spent so
much time in the dark.

397
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:41,090
So what changed?

398
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:47,020
I suppose I had to learn how
powerful courage could be.

399
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:51,240
I suppose I had to learn how
to tell myself the truth.

400
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:59,120
I got to thinking about all the
people whose lives I ruined.

401
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:03,790
And it's not killing that's
going to take that away.

402
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:07,440
Finally, I defended
someone for the first time.

403
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,300
Courage isn't about winning.

404
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,760
It's about doing.

405
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:23,030
And what I'm going to do,
Joseph, is find your son.

406
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:28,180
I want him to know how you
saved me from the dark.
