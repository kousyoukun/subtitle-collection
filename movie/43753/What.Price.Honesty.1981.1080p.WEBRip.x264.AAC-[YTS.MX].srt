3
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,600
Today is your graduation day

4
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,080
Starting from tomorrow

5
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,560
you'll take up the sacred task

6
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,280
of protecting the law

7
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,120
We need you now

8
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,160
to expand your prowess

9
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,680
to protect the peace and
prosperity of our province

10
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,280
If we want our province to

11
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,320
become a safe society

12
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,160
we all have to work together

13
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,440
and strive for it

14
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,240
Gambling Prohibited

15
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,160
Lost again

16
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,120
Sir, long time no see

17
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,480
I am still sick from last time

18
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,040
wait till I am well

19
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,920
What's the big deal!

20
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,800
Watch your step

21
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,640
Put up your stakes

22
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,200
Pay up...

23
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,720
Here, take it and leave

24
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,280
Place your bet

25
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,720
Wishing you wealth & prosperity

26
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,160
Your skin is so fair and smooth

27
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,160
Hey, let go

28
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,760
Mom, that guy's here again...let go

29
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,600
What brings you here? Have a seat

30
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,960
Is that free of charge?

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,480
How can that be?

32
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,040
Give me a free ride for once

33
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,280
It's our bread and butter

34
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,400
Chuan Fa, bring some money

35
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,160
for this bastard

36
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,080
What's the matter?

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,280
All done?

38
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,160
Yes

39
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,240
It's done

40
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,440
It's done

41
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,040
What is done?

42
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,400
What is done?

43
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,040
I don't know

44
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,400
Isn't gambling outlawed?

45
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,200
Yes

46
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,800
Look

47
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,000
Arrest them

48
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,960
Stop...stand still...

49
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,320
Stand still

50
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,920
Please, sir, don't trash my place

51
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,080
I have paid

52
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,080
Paid what?

53
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,800
Old man, come quickly

54
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,720
you haven't paid yet

55
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,280
Give me some face

56
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,040
What face? Go

57
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,720
Don't be too harsh, okay?

58
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
What do you mean?

59
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,960
Shut up or I'll arrest you too

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,640
Move...You come with me

61
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,400
You don't know what you're up against

62
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,040
Do you know who I am?

63
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,320
Who are you?

64
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,000
Threatening the officer,
I'll arrest you too

65
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,320
Let's go

66
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,680
Wait

67
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,120
Chief Liu,
you've come in good time, they...

68
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,800
What do you want?

69
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,160
We are here to arrest these outlaws

70
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,480
Who asked you to?

71
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,080
Right

72
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,040
The royal court has
decreed against gambling

73
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,960
Since your men are here

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,320
help us take them back

75
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,040
Wait, though there's the decree

76
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,040
the official document hasn't arrived

77
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,800
Gambling is still legal, let them go

78
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:04,920
Chief Liu

79
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,920
They have ruined many lives
with their gambling racket

80
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,000
should we let them go just like this?

81
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,840
Do as I say

82
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,440
Do you have respect for the law?

83
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,200
You dare to refuse an order?

84
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,480
No...

85
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,000
Forget it, insubordination is
a cardinal mistake

86
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,160
For your any special operatives
in the future

87
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,120
let me approve it first

88
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,640
Let's go

89
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,560
Yes

90
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,680
Forget it

91
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,200
Catch the thief

92
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,880
Stop, don't move

93
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,000
Don't run

94
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,280
Stand still

95
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,160
Don't run

96
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,080
Stand still

97
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,560
Still wanna run?

98
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,240
Stealing my things, come over here

99
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,440
Don't move

100
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,360
You dare mess with me

101
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,960
He's only a petty thief

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,800
why all the fuss?

103
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,560
What are you grumbling about?

104
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,480
We're lawfully nabbing a thief,
none of your business

105
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,360
How many times have you stolen?

106
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,160
Once

107
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,960
Once? You want to lie to me?

108
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,720
Kneel...hold your head

109
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,920
Sir, how can I get on with my business?

110
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,520
Stop shouting...you are his accomplice?

111
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,120
No

112
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,440
No? Then what are you shouting at?

113
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,320
What did he steal?

114
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,640
He stole my potato

115
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,400
Potato

116
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,560
Stealing potato

117
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,760
He's just stealing potato, let him go

118
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,880
How can he be released just like that

119
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,680
Sir, please give me a chance, let me go

120
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,720
Take him back to the yamen
(magistrate's office)

121
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,160
Ferocious Leopard Garrison

122
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,520
I shouldn't be the only one
to pay for his meal

123
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,480
Come, let's split it

124
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,400
Have you finished eating yet?

125
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,840
Yes, I'm full now...haven't eaten for days

126
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,720
Fatty, we want to teach you a lesson

127
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,280
this time we catch you

128
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,960
Don't steal again, leave

129
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,040
Thank you, Sir

130
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,280
Who are you?

131
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,960
Chief Liu, he stole a potato

132
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,120
We've already taught him a lesson

133
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,000
and are letting him go now

134
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,920
What? How can you release a thief?

135
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,000
Arrest him

136
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,320
Sir, please let me go

137
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,120
Chief Liu

138
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,600
Are there any unresolved cases recently?

139
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,880
Two burglary cases and three robberies

140
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,200
Right

141
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,920
Fatty, you must be the one behind them

142
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,440
Not me

143
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,920
Aren't you going to admit?

144
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,840
I didn't do it, why should I admit?

145
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,680
You dare talk back

146
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,200
Chief Liu, please check it out first

147
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,760
Think I need advice from you?

148
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,600
Fatty, stop lying

149
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,640
you'd better confess

150
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,240
I didn't do it, why should I?

151
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,680
Will you admit or not?

152
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,120
I didn't do it, why should I admit?

153
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,240
No?

154
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,320
Will you admit or not?

155
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,760
Alright, I admit...stop beating, I admit

156
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,720
What are you looking at? Lock him up

157
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,120
Detain these two

158
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,800
Get in, go...Hurry

159
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,840
Where's the document?

160
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,480
Alright, you come in

161
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,120
Go in

162
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,600
Come over, sign the document

163
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,920
What did you do...so as to be arrested?

164
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,000
Arson

165
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,480
Where are you from?

166
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,600
From the Green Dragon Town

167
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,960
You know the rules here?

168
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,320
I do...

169
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,240
Next, go over

170
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,360
What crime have you committed?

171
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,560
Stealing

172
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,200
Where are you from?

173
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,680
Nowhere, I'm from here

174
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,240
Do you know the rules?

175
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,200
No

176
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:17,960
Beat him

177
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,720
Yes

178
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,440
Stop, what are you doing?

179
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,080
Teach him a lesson

180
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,680
He's here in jail not to be
your whipping boy

181
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,080
Are you new here?

182
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,280
Yes, we've just graduated

183
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,160
Newcomer, there's some money for you

184
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,760
Brother, there's some money for you

185
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,320
Take it

186
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,600
You are trying to pick on me

187
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,040
Brother, if I were picking on you

188
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,560
I'll simply lock you up

189
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,240
What? You gonna lock me up?

190
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,640
Needless to say

191
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,760
Bribing officials,
blackmailing inmates, using

192
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,240
illegal torture;
these are enough to convict you

193
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,920
What are you laughing at?
Hand the prisoner over to me

194
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,440
I can do whatever I like

195
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,320
Are there any laws in here?

196
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,000
This is my turf, my fist is the law

197
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,280
Stop beating

198
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,600
Get lost

199
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,200
I've told you to stop beating,
didn't you hear that?

200
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,080
None of your business

201
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,960
Stop

202
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,000
Stop beating

203
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,920
Don't move

204
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,080
It's just a misunderstanding

205
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,960
Damn you

206
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,680
Come over...Stop beating

207
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,640
Are you alright?

208
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,320
You bastard, how dare you go against me

209
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,640
It's just misunderstanding

210
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,880
Never mind...let's go

211
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,240
Stand still, you can't walk away
just like that

212
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,320
What do you want? Kill us?

213
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,440
Or put us into prison?

214
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,960
In case you are here one day

215
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,360
I'll make you pay for it

216
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,640
You too had better be careful

217
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,120
If you break any laws in my territory

218
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,560
I won't let you get off so easily,
let's go

219
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,840
Fu Yuan Bank

220
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,120
Take care

221
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,600
Give me some change

222
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,480
Just a moment please

223
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,360
Don't move...

224
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,280
Don't move, everyone

225
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,720
Go over, squat on the ground

226
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,560
Put it in, hurry

227
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,960
It's hot, come and have some tea, here...

228
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,160
Sir, you...

229
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,680
What? Do I have to pay first?

230
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,600
I don't mean that

231
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,960
You pay him

232
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,640
Pay him

233
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,800
Me paying again

234
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,800
How much?

235
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,680
3 cents

236
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,520
Forget it...

237
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,600
Thank you...

238
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,720
Wait for me

239
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,880
Why do I have to pay the bill everytime?

240
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,280
Get a brass gong

241
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,400
Run

242
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,320
Help, robbery

243
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,320
Stand still

244
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,480
Don't run

245
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,160
Stand still

246
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,080
Don't run

247
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,640
Run

248
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,840
Bastard, what a nerve

249
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,040
You want to beat him to death?

250
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,920
This rascal, I can beat him even harder

251
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,400
We must observe the law,
bring him back, go

252
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,760
Turn a blind eye, brother

253
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,440
Let's split it, okay?

254
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,760
What do you take me for?

255
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,360
Why are you so foolish
to turn down the money?

256
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,080
Bastard

257
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,720
You're right, must beat him up

258
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,880
Go...

259
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,240
Who put that money in my drawer?

260
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,120
Who did it?

261
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,080
Who knows, just take it

262
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,880
I've got some too

263
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,400
Bring it over

264
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,240
If I knew who did that

265
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,320
I won't spare him

266
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,480
It's alright, you can go

267
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,040
Thank you

268
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,120
Stand still

269
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,720
The real chief has run away

270
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,360
I let him go so he could be the bait

271
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,200
Release him

272
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,880
No, just now he wanted to kill me

273
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,440
Did he?

274
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,880
Chief Liu, he's the leader,
don't let him go

275
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,800
Bastard, you are a new-comer,
you know nothing

276
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,360
Didn't you see the money in your drawer?

277
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,520
What? You put that in

278
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,040
You took the money,
what are you shouting at

279
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,440
This is dirty money

280
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,600
I don't want it

281
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,480
What an idiot!

282
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,760
What did you say?

283
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,080
Don't be so reckless

284
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,440
Chief Liu, you are sheltering a criminal

285
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,160
Who's the boss here?

286
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,800
Damn, who would accept this sort of thing

287
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,960
I might as well quit

288
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,200
Pick it up

289
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,920
What for?

290
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,480
We can't do anything
against these bastards

291
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,280
and rid the people of oppression

292
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,920
our hands are tied

293
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,360
How could we do our job?

294
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,800
I am the same as you

295
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,600
He'll be happy if we quit

296
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,360
If you do that, you are giving in to him

297
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,880
This is exactly what they want

298
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,320
Put that on

299
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,120
Do you want to get rid of these bastards?

300
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,080
Of course

301
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,960
Good, put it on for the time being

302
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,720
then we could help the people
get rid of oppression

303
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,360
Anyhow

304
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,960
We have to stick to our principles

305
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,840
Three in one as long as we live

306
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,520
Fight for justice

307
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,280
Weed out the wicked and
let the people live in peace

308
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,520
The three of us will
join force together hereafter

309
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,680
We'll all share the bliss

310
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,680
and I'll face the crisis, cheers

311
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,640
Cheers

312
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,600
What's going on?

313
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,600
Let's go

314
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,760
Arrest them all

315
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,680
don't get in our way

316
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,960
Arrest them

317
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,280
Look

318
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,440
So absurd

319
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,000
Arresting hawkers but not the gamblers

320
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,080
What are you doing? Help to arrest them

321
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,160
Life is difficult,
don't push them too hard

322
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,120
You dare to defy order?

323
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,800
Do it

324
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,440
Do you want to get fired?

325
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,320
We lose if we argue with him, forget it...

326
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,520
If you are scared, go and help them

327
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,880
Constable Liu, if you are capable

328
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,040
why don't you capture that wanted criminal

329
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:21,880
Go

330
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,000
If worse comes to worst, I'll quit

331
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,560
You'll learn not to mess with me

332
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:32,920
You haven't paid

333
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,160
Damn you

334
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
What are you doing?

335
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,000
Buy some bananas

336
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,840
Madam

337
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,520
Money...These bastards

338
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,440
are bullies

339
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,720
I must take them to court

340
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,960
What's the point of taking them to court

341
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,680
They are from the magistrate

342
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,600
Madam...Of all people

343
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,280
you have to marry an official

344
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,560
this is not the acceptable thing to do

345
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,080
Uncle Cheung

346
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,480
Uncle

347
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,560
You're back?

348
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,200
Yes

349
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,560
What are you two playing at?

350
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,480
What are you doing? Go...go home

351
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,560
-Congratulation
-You're too kind...

352
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,440
Thank you

353
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,520
You're back, come to my house
and have a drink

354
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,240
I'll go change first

355
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,800
Congratulations, today is your birthday

356
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,000
Let's celebrate

357
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,720
This kid is getting more and more like me

358
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,520
Of course. If not,
that will be a big problem

359
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,240
What's the problem?

360
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,800
Dear, he said this kid...

361
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,360
Nothing...I was saying that tonight

362
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,920
we have to drink to our hearts' content

363
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,800
I'll change my clothes first,
and I'll come by later

364
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,520
Hurry

365
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,280
Hurry

366
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,200
Xiu Lian

367
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Xiu Lian, what are you doing?

368
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Nothing

369
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,520
Don't lie to me

370
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,520
What have you suffered?

371
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,240
Tell me

372
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,600
Why do you have to work as a constable?

373
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,720
What's wrong with that?

374
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,040
Everyone hates you

375
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,680
As long as we are upright

376
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,760
what's to be afraid of, never mind them

377
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,520
But the neighbours...

378
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,600
I know you have suffered

379
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,080
If we bear a clear conscience,
people will respect us

380
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,800
Brother He...urgent call

381
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,680
All constables report to
the station immediately

382
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,280
What happened?

383
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,400
Bandit Sun Long has appeared at last and

384
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,560
is fighting with our men
at the Temple of Chivalry

385
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,120
You go back first

386
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,920
Alright

387
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,880
Zhong Heng

388
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,640
I'll come back soon

389
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,160
What? Today is my birthday

390
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,880
My husband has taken leave

391
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,640
I know

392
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,080
But this is an order from the top

393
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,440
Never mind him, let's go in

394
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,280
Madam, this is official business,
he must go

395
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,480
If he doesn't

396
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,640
he might be fired

397
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,440
I don't care

398
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,080
Just as well he is rid of this job

399
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,120
Many friends and relatives are here
for your birthday

400
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,200
How could you leave?

401
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,520
Go in and entertain them, okay?

402
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,760
Ying Hao, don't go

403
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,640
I'll be right back

404
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,760
Go

405
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,920
Ying Hao

406
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,920
I swear I'll never marry
an official in my next life

407
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,120
You are so capable
when arresting the hawkers, go

408
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,840
You're here just in time, go

409
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,520
Go away, or I'll kill him

410
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,960
Charge in right now

411
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,600
Then the hostage will be in danger

412
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,240
Never mind him;
Don't wanna score some brownie points?

413
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,720
It's dangerous to charge in like this

414
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,200
Who's in charge here, you or me?

415
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,120
Why don't we launch a surprise attack?

416
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,840
Good, but you might not have the ability

417
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,440
Come, let's show him how good we are

418
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,840
Brother He, be careful

419
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,080
We plan to charge in separately

420
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,040
once we extract the hostage,
charge in immediately

421
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,640
Right

422
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,480
Let's go

423
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,080
Sun Long, you've been surrounded

424
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,360
you can't escape

425
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,160
Come out and surrender

426
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,880
Come in if you dare

427
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,360
The worst is we'll all die together

428
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,440
Don't be rash

429
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,320
we can talk this through

430
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,280
What's to talk about?

431
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,240
Would you let me go?

432
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,280
Don't take me as a fool

433
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,520
Don't be such a coward

434
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,280
come on out if you have guts

435
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,600
Save the bull shit

436
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,720
Give me a horse and some money

437
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,400
or I'll kill him

438
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,040
Don't come near or you'll die

439
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,520
Careful

440
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,960
Brother He...

441
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,760
Quick

442
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,120
Come and save him, quick

443
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,920
Hurry

444
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,480
Come men, hurry

445
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,840
Chief, let's charge in now

446
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,640
No, the hostage is still inside

447
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,760
Let's see how good

448
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,000
the three of them are

449
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,640
Come, men

450
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,000
Ying Hao

451
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,120
Stop him

452
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,480
Get out of my way

453
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,320
Stop

454
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,960
Take him away

455
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,600
Yes

456
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,760
I want to kill him...out of my way

457
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,280
Shut up, the law will deal with him

458
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,080
How could you punish him on your own terms

459
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,840
Let's go

460
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,760
Yes

461
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,040
Are you alright?

462
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,760
Yes, just shaken up

463
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,520
I thought I'm finished this time

464
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,880
You were lucky

465
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,440
Chief Liu

466
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,160
Chief Liu, what is it?

467
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,320
I want to see Lord Ge

468
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,800
Please wait, I'll announce you

469
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,440
Sir, Chief Liu wants to see you

470
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,440
on a matter of utmost importance

471
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,760
Damn, tell him I also have
important matters on hand

472
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,000
and ask him to get lost

473
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,680
Go on

474
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,400
Yes

475
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,280
Chief Liu, you...

476
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,920
Sir, Sun Long the robber has been caught

477
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,520
So what? Leave me alone

478
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,560
But on hearing the news his brothers

479
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,280
have come for a petition

480
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,240
Damn, I am busy

481
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,480
They said it's inconvenient
in the day time

482
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,720
Looks like they have brought gifts

483
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:19,080
Wei Wu

484
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,880
Bring the prisoner

485
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,160
Sun Long has killed an official
and is inexcusable

486
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,400
but considering it was self defense

487
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,760
he'll be imprisoned for 3 months

488
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,080
Thank you, your honour

489
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,440
Brother He

490
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,480
Don't be like this

491
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,240
Leave me alone

492
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,960
Keep calm

493
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,240
Keep calm

494
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,280
Our job is to get rid of outlaws

495
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,920
But they are doing quite the contrary

496
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,520
I'll fight them to the end

497
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,280
Brother He, Ying Hao's death

498
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,560
is a result of Chief Liu's treachery

499
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,920
He's on to us the whole time

500
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,840
how could we prevail?

501
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,040
So are you saying we should give up?

502
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,200
How could we face Ying Hao? Speak...

503
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,160
If we fought to the end

504
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,960
would you be with me?

505
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,760
The officials have great power

506
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,280
let's be wise and preserve our lives

507
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,240
What?

508
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,360
Have you forgotten

509
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,160
how the three of us swore

510
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,560
to protect each other?

511
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,000
Have you forgotten our ideals
for being a constable?

512
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:53,880
Yes, but ideals and reality
are two different things

513
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,640
In this lawless society

514
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,640
justice is a sham

515
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,520
Justice always prevails;

516
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:05,400
It's just that some people are cowards

517
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,920
making justice a sham

518
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,040
I am not afraid of death

519
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,320
If I could get rid of evil and crimes

520
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,600
I'd do it

521
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,080
Ying Hao's kind of death was for nothing

522
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,800
and would only produce widows and orphans

523
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,320
was it worth anything?

524
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,200
Madam

525
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,520
Let me go...

526
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,520
I only became a widow

527
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:52,960
and my child became an orphan
just because of you

528
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,640
I know how you feel

529
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,520
Take care of yourself

530
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,360
Let me go, Ying Hao will never forgive you

531
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,680
Come in

532
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,280
Bring it here

533
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,200
Your husband died young

534
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,720
I don't think you have
enough money to bury him

535
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,120
Take it

536
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,080
Let's go

537
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,960
Okay

538
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,440
Wait

539
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,480
Though we are poor

540
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,160
we don't want your charity

541
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,040
You dare to refuse it

542
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:04,200
You do all this evil for money

543
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,520
we want no part of it, go away

544
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,000
Damn, let's go

545
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,240
This is a small token
from us brothers, please take it

546
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,000
My husband's life

547
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,400
cannot be bought by money

548
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:18,960
Madam

549
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,840
Luo Zhang, let's go

550
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,480
Take care

551
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,840
You really want to go?

552
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,920
Where are you off to?

553
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,920
Back to my hometown, to raise my kid

554
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,080
and live a simple life

555
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,480
Why be so pessimistic?

556
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,520
I am a woman

557
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:55,520
In this macho world

558
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,640
how would I survive without a husband?

559
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,240
Besides, this society thrives
on power, not reason

560
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,120
I want to leave here

561
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,720
and leave the painful memories behind

562
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,800
I made some clothes for your kid

563
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,280
Do take them

564
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,560
Take care

565
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,360
Thank you...

566
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,480
I'm going, you should be at peace

567
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,760
Taking up a good cause
for the people, my husband died

568
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,200
who could give him back to me!

569
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,920
It's not your fault

570
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,280
why blame yourself

571
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,160
If it weren't for me why would he die?

572
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,080
Why don't you give up being a constable

573
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,440
Hey, let's both quit &
return to our hometown together

574
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,960
I want to be an upright official

575
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,800
so everyone would know that

576
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,400
righteous officials still exist

577
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,480
What difference would it make?

578
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,240
All the same they'd end up
as victims of evil ministers

579
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,480
You need say no more

580
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,960
I have made up my mind

581
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,680
Won't work unless our lot
mixes in with the bad guys

582
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,600
What are you saying?

583
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,400
As they say:
'Birds of a feather flock together'

584
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,960
If not, you'd be the next

585
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,000
A hero is upright

586
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,320
he could lose his life, but not his honour

587
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,360
I'll not give in

588
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,880
You risk your life to catch criminals

589
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,560
yet a murderer is only imprisoned
for 3 months

590
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,280
how are you going to fight against them?

591
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,120
Though the law and justice didn't work

592
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,560
my fist is my justice

593
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,320
Help...

594
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,680
Let go

595
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,280
Help

596
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,320
Help, let go, don't

597
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,200
Let go

598
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,160
Help

599
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,240
Don't

600
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,120
Let go

601
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,160
Help

602
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:59,480
Help, let go

603
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,280
Help

604
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,240
Don't

605
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,680
Let go, help

606
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,840
Help

607
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,040
Let go

608
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,920
Don't run

609
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,400
Don't run

610
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,320
Come...

611
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,000
Miss

612
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,560
Stand still...

613
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,000
Miss

614
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,840
Don't run

615
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,600
Halt

616
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,920
Stop please

617
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,920
At worst I'll go to jail

618
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,320
That'll be too good for you

619
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,880
What do you want?

620
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,480
Make you a cripple

621
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,280
This is Chief Liu's territory

622
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,240
Go to hell

623
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,080
You again

624
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,840
Stop...you are a mad dog

625
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,920
Do you want to get fired?

626
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,240
Are you blind?

627
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,480
I don't know what you are saying

628
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,560
Stop pretending

629
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,480
Don't be rash

630
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,000
Rash? I'm going to arrest you

631
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,120
You dare?

632
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,360
Well, can't I?

633
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,960
He is barking up the wrong tree

634
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,920
Right, we did our job for nothing

635
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,840
we'll starve if we go on like this

636
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,680
Tell chief Liu

637
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,280
Chief Liu, what should we do?

638
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,080
Shut up

639
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,920
Hard to believe I can't handle him

640
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,760
Brother He, watch it

641
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,040
you'll suffer for it
if you go against them

642
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,440
We all die sooner or later

643
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,560
It's up to fate to decide when

644
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,400
but we must die a glorious death

645
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,760
and we should charter our destiny

646
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,760
Brother He, agreed you can
go against the robbers

647
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,040
but could you go against the officials?

648
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,960
Haven't you heard of
'survival of the fittest'?

649
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,440
You of all people talk to me about that?

650
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,000
You are a man

651
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,000
why be afraid of them?

652
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,520
I am not afraid

653
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,440
I also had my ideals

654
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,360
but is it worth dying in this

655
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,840
world without justice?

656
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,840
Besides, I have my family

657
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,480
I...need to go on living

658
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,960
If you are so afraid of
those corrupt officials

659
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,840
why be a constable in the first place?

660
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,480
I just wanted a job
and provide for my family

661
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,960
Provide for family,
survival of the fittest

662
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,240
From now onwards

663
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,560
we'll go separate ways

664
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,400
Brother He

665
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,560
I won't be weak like you, shying away

666
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,120
As long as I live, I won't bow to evil

667
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,800
Brother He...

668
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,920
Why did you want to see me?

669
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,960
I...

670
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,720
Please sit

671
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,080
Just tell me

672
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,440
I...want to leave here

673
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,920
They want to force me to be a part of them

674
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,240
I want to quit this job

675
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,560
Just as well

676
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,680
But they won't let me go easily

677
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,800
I don't even dare to go home now

678
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,080
On my behalf please
hand this money to my family

679
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,480
and tell them I've left this place

680
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,480
and that I'll fetch them later

681
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,600
This is my resignation,
please hand it in for me

682
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,880
Why is my name there?

683
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,520
It's from me to you

684
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,360
Please tell Chief Liu

685
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:54,040
I don't want to get you involved

686
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,960
I'm going

687
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,360
Luo Zhang

688
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,880
Farewell and take care

689
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,760
Luo Zhang

690
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,520
Dear Brother Zhong Heng

691
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,080
Thank you for the drawings
of the treasury and

692
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,640
the guard posts

693
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,320
Further to discussion
we've decided to follow your plan

694
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:30,160
and storm the treasury on 15th of August

695
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,000
We look forward to your support

696
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,520
and enclose a hundred taels of gold

697
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,720
You'll be further rewarded after the heist

698
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,760
Quick...catch him

699
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:49,880
Bring him back

700
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,600
Yes

701
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,240
You beast

702
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,400
Why frame me?

703
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,880
You have some guts

704
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,360
you dare to rob the treasury

705
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,160
Arrest him

706
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,240
Yes

707
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,680
Don't come near

708
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,880
This is between Chief Liu and me

709
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,280
it's none of your business

710
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,040
don't force my hand to kill

711
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,480
Whoever gets him will be heavily rewarded

712
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,840
Grab him

713
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,320
Grab him

714
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,560
Hurry

715
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,560
You still want to resist arrest?

716
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,480
Bring him back

717
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,320
Yes

718
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,960
Let's go

719
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,080
Sir, now that we're rid of him

720
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,560
there'll be peace

721
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,480
Yes

722
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:51,200
It's all your good idea

723
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,000
You're too kind

724
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,640
Now we can do great things

725
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,600
Yes

726
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,960
He Zhong Heng was
looking for trouble by himself

727
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,360
it's survival of the fittest

728
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,920
he deserved to die

729
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,880
Right...

730
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,920
How should we deal with him?

731
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,480
I have my plans

732
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,120
What are you doing?

733
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,480
Nothing

734
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,520
You did a great job this time

735
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,440
This silver is for you

736
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,040
What? Too little?

737
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,000
You don't want it?

738
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,600
Take it, many people don't get
this kind of a chance

739
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,560
Thanks but no thanks

740
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,240
I only hope
my family would be released soon

741
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,200
I would be satisfied with that

742
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,440
What?

743
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,680
Why have you detained his whole family?

744
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,200
One is enough

745
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,000
Let them all go

746
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,480
Yes...

747
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,480
Luo Zhang, if you listen to me

748
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:04,120
I'll be easy on you. As for your family

749
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,680
I'll send them back

750
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,080
don't worry

751
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,760
It's okay, go

752
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,360
Thank you

753
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,200
Bring the prisoner

754
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,760
As a constable

755
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,160
you break the law

756
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,880
and conspire with robbers
to rob the treasury

757
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,760
You're relieved of your post

758
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,640
and sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment

759
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,720
You cur

760
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,200
Take him away at once

761
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,080
Take him away

762
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:06,160
Mr He, things change

763
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,520
didn't you say you'll fix me?

764
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,320
Well, come on

765
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,160
Let me see how good you are

766
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,240
Grab him here

767
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,160
I said, once the prisoner is sent here

768
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,280
I can do anything I like with him

769
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,520
Understand?

770
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:31,400
Bring him here

771
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:31,960
Yes

772
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,440
Get up

773
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,240
Kneel

774
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,640
Kneel...

775
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,360
I kneel only to the heaven,
king and teacher

776
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,720
not to a cur like you

777
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,520
Beat him

778
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,280
Beat him till he kneels

779
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,000
Yes

780
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,280
Kneel

781
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,560
With all your might

782
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,960
You go against yourself
when you go against me

783
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,440
Come on, just kill me

784
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:23,080
I am not through with you yet

785
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,160
Death would be easy for you, come, men

786
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,600
put him together with the prisoners

787
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,080
caught by him

788
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,200
Let them have a party with him

789
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:40,840
Wait

790
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:45,160
Don't kill him,
Chief Liu isn't through with him yet

791
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,800
Let's go

792
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,280
I was imprisoned and hit in the groin

793
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,520
You'll suffer the same thing today

794
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,480
Stop

795
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,200
What are you doing? Want to kill him?

796
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:11,560
Dammit, aren't you human?

797
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,440
Don't you see he is heavily wounded?

798
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,400
Go wash his wounds with your pee

799
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:46,520
My turn to teach you a lesson

800
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,040
Brother Loong

801
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:11,880
Smells good

802
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,520
What are you doing?

803
00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:01,520
Stop

804
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,160
Let me go

805
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,160
Go and tell fifth master

806
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,400
I want that bastard gotten rid of

807
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,400
I'll pay whatever he wants

808
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,240
Have you collected the goods?

809
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,080
Yes

810
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,200
Fifth master said
not to give him anything to eat

811
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,560
Okay

812
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:33,680
Move

813
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,640
Go inside

814
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,320
Speak up

815
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,480
Thank you

816
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,000
You...

817
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:59,080
How could you fight against the officials?

818
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,800
Why didn't you listen to me?

819
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,440
In this corrupt society

820
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,560
justice can't be gotten
with mere principles

821
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,520
Well, I still have faith that

822
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,280
justice will prevail

823
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,560
If that were true

824
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,200
you wouldn't be here now

825
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,760
Ying Hao wouldn't have died for nothing

826
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,520
Luo Zhang would not have sold himself out

827
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,280
Don't mention that bastard

828
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,120
Did you know he was coerced?

829
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,040
I said don't mention him

830
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:42,840
What would you do if

831
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,040
you were the one who were
held hostage by that bastard?

832
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:54,040
I'd rather die than be a dog

833
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,840
Do you think the problem
will be solved just by dying?

834
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,520
You are too selfish; ever thought about

835
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:07,880
what would happen to me if you died?

836
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,480
You'd better stay away
from here as far as possible

837
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,360
Find someone and remarry

838
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,440
Thirty years

839
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:26,800
I don't know if I'd live that long enough

840
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:34,480
Don't worry, I'll redress
an injustice for you

841
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:40,200
Redress? To those corrupt officials?

842
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:46,160
Of course not. There's an imperial envoy

843
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,600
who'll be coming here
to canvass the peoples' sentiment

844
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,080
I hear he is honest & righteous

845
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,480
I plan to present my case to him

846
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,600
No matter what happens,
you ought to survive

847
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,960
and testify against that corrupt official

848
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,160
Damn it, want to sue me?

849
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,360
Kill her

850
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:08,880
Help

851
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,080
You want to run away?

852
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,480
Let me down...

853
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,040
Help

854
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,560
Is there any law?
Murdering in broad daylight

855
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:44,880
Report to the court immediately

856
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,320
What are you looking at?

857
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,440
Here...

858
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:51,720
Where?

859
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:52,600
Here...

860
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:53,640
Hurry and go

861
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,760
The official is here, hurry and go

862
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:03,760
Come in and have a look

863
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,760
They ran that way

864
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:07,280
Follow me

865
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,160
Yes

866
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:15,840
Good work, you'll all be rewarded

867
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,160
It's been said that the imperial envoy

868
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,120
will be here soon

869
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:26,240
Families of the prisoners
planned to file complaints

870
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,880
How should we handle them?

871
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,440
Let's be ruthless

872
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,640
I plan get rid of them

873
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,720
Then more people will be killed?

874
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,560
They have to be uprooted
to prevent future trouble;

875
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,800
Especially that He Zhong Heng

876
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,360
Sun Long

877
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:01,320
What is it, don't you see I'm sleeping?

878
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,040
Fifth master wants to see you

879
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:06,880
Didn't you say that

880
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,520
you want to kill He Zhong Heng
with your own hands

881
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,400
and are willing to pay

882
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,600
How much can you pay for that?

883
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,000
As much as you want, how about that?

884
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,640
Good...

885
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:23,360
There will be a thorough clean up
in this prison

886
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,920
These bamboo sticks are for your brothers

887
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:27,960
Five hundred taels of silver each

888
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,520
So expensive?

889
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,720
Immunity stick

890
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,120
May heaven bless

891
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,240
my wife could help exonerate me

892
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,320
Take it

893
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:54,360
Thank you

894
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:56,640
Thank you

895
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:07,760
What is it, constable He

896
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,920
Are you comfortable staying here?

897
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,480
What is it?

898
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:17,040
Why didn't you greet your old friends

899
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,760
I don't have friends
without integrity like you

900
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:22,840
What's the price of integrity? Idiot

901
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,400
I advised you before

902
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:27,360
and you didn't listen to me

903
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,080
Serves you right, you must regret this

904
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,120
You beast

905
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,040
Still trying to be put on airs

906
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,480
You've deteriorated,
I'll fight you to the death

907
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,720
It's all because of you

908
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,280
that we haven't had
the chance of making a fast buck

909
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:59,120
Let me thank you on behalf of the brothers

910
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,040
Calm down...listen to me

911
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:21,720
Your wife is dead

912
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:24,560
How come?

913
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:26,240
Killed by Chief Liu

914
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,120
Why?

915
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:31,160
He wouldn't even let her go?

916
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,600
Because she wanted to
file a complaint for you

917
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,360
Beaten like this, as good as dead

918
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,560
Never mind him, go

919
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:04,680
If you have the chance to get out of here

920
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:09,280
Go away as far as possible
and never come back

921
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:16,680
Whether you could get out or not

922
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,640
I've prepared for you at the temple

923
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:21,400
some daily necessities

924
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:25,120
I've been watched all day

925
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,640
These are all I could bring to you

926
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,880
Take care

927
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:35,880
Luo Zhang

928
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,280
Be smart

929
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,280
I'll be out of prison in two days' time

930
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,080
Congratulations

931
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:26,040
Hurry and come back

932
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,240
Don't say unlucky things

933
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,760
What are you doing?

934
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:50,720
I'll be out of the prison in two days

935
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:51,800
What are you doing?

936
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:57,920
I'm not leaving...

937
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:09,280
Why didn't you get them? I'm not leaving

938
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:13,520
Please

939
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:20,040
Master...spare me

940
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,640
Master...spare me

941
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:29,320
Go...

942
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:34,840
I'm not going, let go of me, I'm not going

943
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:41,480
I'm not going...

944
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:45,400
Let go of me

945
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,800
Please help

946
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,360
I am the chief of robbers
and you are a constable

947
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,680
What if you caught me?

948
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:14,080
Tonight I'll be out of the prison

949
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:16,480
and you have to die here

950
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:20,000
You've made me blind

951
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,600
and I have to take your life to pay for it

952
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,360
You killed my brother,
who's going to pay for that?

953
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,040
You still have a loud mouth

954
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:12,400
Go over...

955
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:20,320
Archers, ready

956
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:21,560
Shoot

957
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:28,480
Don't kill me

958
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:39,320
Shoot

959
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:47,360
Shoot

960
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,680
It's alright in here

961
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,440
Get someone to pick up the bodies

962
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:36,960
Yes

963
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Hurry and go

964
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:39,880
Is Master Sun out yet?

965
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:40,720
No

966
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:41,880
Go and prepare some food

967
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,160
I must drink with Master Sun

968
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,560
Four, five, six, big

969
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:50,640
You lose

970
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,440
Coming

971
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:53,800
Go, be there right away

972
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:57,360
Well? No more grudges?

973
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,040
Feel better?

974
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:56,560
Master He

975
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:09,800
Master He, don't kill me

976
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:12,320
I want you to know
what it feels like being tortured

977
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:15,280
Master He, from tomorrow onwards

978
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:18,560
I'll turn over a new leaf

979
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:22,840
Master He, spare me, it's not my fault

980
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:26,680
I just follow instructions

981
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:27,520
Too late

982
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,200
Send the carriage over

983
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:52,920
Hurry

984
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:55,760
Hurry

985
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,080
Take it away,
bring the third carriage over

986
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:05,520
Hurry...alright, hurry

987
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:17,800
Temple of Chivalry

988
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:03,760
You corrupt officer

989
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:33,240
Help...

990
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,760
What is it?

991
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:41,040
Just had a nightmare, let's go...

992
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:42,040
Yes

993
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:43,560
Let's go

994
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,560
Yes

995
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,080
Attack

996
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:33,800
What to do?

997
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:34,960
Call for help

998
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,440
What are you doing here? Go

999
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:39,040
Go

1000
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:43,160
Go

1001
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:37,000
See, another one got killed

1002
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:38,680
Master, don't move, keep quiet

1003
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:37,400
You can't get away

1004
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:50,040
Chase

1005
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,720
Hurry...

1006
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:02,760
Don't come over, or I'll kill him

1007
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:03,680
Don't be mistaken

1008
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:06,360
This is Chief Liu's idea,
I have nothing to do with it

1009
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,280
Go

1010
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,520
Hurry...

1011
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:14,080
Don't follow me or I'll kill him

1012
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:17,200
Go away, make way...

1013
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:22,640
The Temple of Chivalry is up ahead

1014
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:23,640
Take some men and ambush him

1015
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:25,440
the rest will follow me

1016
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,760
Stand still, catch him

1017
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:50,840
You are coming over

1018
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:53,400
Brother He

1019
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,840
What is it?

1020
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:55,680
Nothing

1021
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,240
Don't come over

1022
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:04,120
I have stayed alive till today

1023
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,360
to be able to see the imperial envoy

1024
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,120
to report your wrongdoings,

1025
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:11,160
to prove my innocence;
don't force me to kill again

1026
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:14,560
Don't be rash, stay away...

1027
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:17,240
Make way...go

1028
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:18,840
Go...

1029
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:31,400
Go, what happened? Go

1030
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:43,480
You are the god of justice

1031
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,720
I kneel to you

1032
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:48,400
and beg you to uphold justice

1033
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:04,000
So long as you let me go,
I'll promise you anything

1034
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:07,240
Let me tell you honestly

1035
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:08,840
no matter what,
you won't be able to escape

1036
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:10,320
Stop shouting or I'll kill you

1037
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:16,520
Split up

1038
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:18,440
Force him out

1039
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:19,240
Yes

1040
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:21,680
What about me?

1041
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:23,120
You are unreliable

1042
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:24,280
Stay here

1043
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:26,600
Attack

1044
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:34,560
Go away

1045
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,040
Go away,
don't make me kill again, go away...

1046
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:38,200
Go away...

1047
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:45,960
The envoy is here

1048
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:48,840
Stay on the line to welcome him

1049
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:49,720
Yes

1050
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:16,600
What's going on in here?

1051
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:20,360
Sir, He Zhong Heng
escaped from prison last night

1052
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,440
and is holding the magistrate as hostage

1053
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:24,600
Don't listen to him

1054
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:25,800
Ready

1055
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,280
Stop

1056
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,480
No one is going to proceed further

1057
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:32,080
until the matter is cleared

1058
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:34,040
or no one lives

1059
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:37,640
This man is ferocious

1060
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:39,120
You'd better go back to the office

1061
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:40,240
and let me handle the case

1062
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:40,880
Damn it

1063
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:41,640
Yes

1064
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:43,800
Injustice should be
thoroughly investigated

1065
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,440
to prevent the innocent
from being wrongly executed

1066
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:50,320
He, why did you hold
a government official hostage?

1067
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:52,800
Do you know that
this is a crime that warrants death?

1068
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:54,560
He doesn't deserve to be
our government official

1069
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:56,640
The one I am holding right now
is a criminal

1070
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,480
who protects prostitution,
gambling, and corruption

1071
01:25:58,520 --> 01:25:59,840
He's talking nonsense

1072
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:00,760
Shut up

1073
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:05,320
Tell me how you've been wronged
and I'll be the judge

1074
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,360
I was originally a constable
in this province

1075
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,320
Since I was against
the crime of this magistrate

1076
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:12,920
he set me up and
put me in prison and killed my wife

1077
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,680
It doesn't matter if I have to die, but

1078
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:17,760
I do hope that you uphold justice
and prove me innocent

1079
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:20,200
Your Honour, he's making
scurrilous attacks upon others

1080
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:24,640
I have always been honest
and abide by the law

1081
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:27,880
Nonsense. Haven't you sent Chief Liu

1082
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:30,040
to come and offer me bribes?

1083
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:31,000
Your Honour, I...

1084
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:34,160
Shut up. When I was canvassing the people

1085
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:36,720
I have already heard that you're corrupt

1086
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:38,800
putting lives of the innocent in danger

1087
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:41,520
Here's the witness, don't you dare deny

1088
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:42,200
Bring the sword

1089
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:43,160
Yes

1090
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:46,840
Spare me, Your Honour;
I know I've been wrong, spare me

1091
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:50,840
You've been corrupt,
your wrongs cannot be forgiven

1092
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:59,280
Be lenient, Your Honour.
Please spare my life

1093
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:24,080
Lord Ge, you have been badly terrified

1094
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:26,640
If I hadn't done this,
saving you was almost impossible

1095
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:28,960
Lord Huang, those gifts...

1096
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,200
They've all been received,
no need for such great gifts

1097
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:34,480
No problem

1098
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:51,520
Come on, men

1099
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:54,880
Archers, shoot

1100
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,240
Attack
