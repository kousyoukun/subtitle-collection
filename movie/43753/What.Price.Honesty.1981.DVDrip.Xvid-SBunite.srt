1
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:38,502
Today is your graduation day

2
00:01:38,622 --> 00:01:41,062
Starting from tomorrow

3
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:44,502
you'll take up the sacred task

4
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:48,262
of protecting the law

5
00:01:53,982 --> 00:01:57,063
We need you now

6
00:01:57,143 --> 00:02:00,143
to expand your prowess

7
00:02:00,263 --> 00:02:03,623
to protect the peace and
prosperity of our province

8
00:02:03,703 --> 00:02:05,223
If we want our province to

9
00:02:05,303 --> 00:02:07,303
become a safe society

10
00:02:07,423 --> 00:02:10,943
we all have to work together

11
00:02:11,063 --> 00:02:14,423
and strive for it

12
00:02:14,503 --> 00:02:16,103
"Gambling Prohibited"

13
00:02:17,143 --> 00:02:18,343
Lost again

14
00:02:19,103 --> 00:02:22,543
Sir, long time no see

15
00:02:22,663 --> 00:02:24,383
I am still sick from last time

16
00:02:24,503 --> 00:02:25,983
wait till I am well

17
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:27,023
What's the big deal!

18
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:27,983
Watch your step

19
00:02:28,703 --> 00:02:31,543
Put up your stakes

20
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,063
Pay up...

21
00:02:34,183 --> 00:02:37,103
Here, take it and leave

22
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:39,343
Place your bet

23
00:02:39,463 --> 00:02:40,583
"Wishing you wealth & prosperity"

24
00:02:47,144 --> 00:02:48,104
Your skin is so fair and smooth

25
00:02:48,184 --> 00:02:49,104
Hey, let go

26
00:02:49,224 --> 00:02:52,584
Mom, that guy's here again... let go

27
00:02:54,264 --> 00:02:56,464
What brings you here? Have a seat

28
00:02:56,584 --> 00:02:59,064
Is that free of charge?

29
00:02:59,144 --> 00:03:01,384
How can that be?

30
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,024
Give me a free ride for once

31
00:03:03,104 --> 00:03:05,264
It's our bread and butter

32
00:03:05,704 --> 00:03:07,264
Chuan Fa, bring some money

33
00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:09,224
for this bastard

34
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:11,864
What's the matter?

35
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,144
All done?

36
00:03:14,264 --> 00:03:15,304
Yes

37
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:19,184
It's done

38
00:03:19,544 --> 00:03:20,424
It's done

39
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:21,864
What is done?

40
00:03:22,224 --> 00:03:23,664
What is done?

41
00:03:23,744 --> 00:03:24,945
I don't know

42
00:03:28,105 --> 00:03:29,265
Isn't gambling outlawed?

43
00:03:29,345 --> 00:03:30,305
Yes

44
00:03:31,705 --> 00:03:32,665
Look

45
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:33,865
Arrest them

46
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:45,065
Stop... stand still...

47
00:03:48,105 --> 00:03:49,065
Stand still

48
00:03:50,345 --> 00:03:51,785
Please, sir, don't trash my place

49
00:03:51,905 --> 00:03:53,105
I have paid

50
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:53,905
Paid what?

51
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,545
Old man, come quickly

52
00:03:57,585 --> 00:03:58,825
you haven't paid yet

53
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:01,145
Give me some face

54
00:04:01,265 --> 00:04:03,305
What face? Go

55
00:04:03,425 --> 00:04:05,465
Don't be too harsh, okay?

56
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:06,625
What do you mean?

57
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,786
Shut up or I'll arrest you too

58
00:04:08,906 --> 00:04:10,706
Move... You come with me

59
00:04:11,746 --> 00:04:14,186
You don't know what you're up against

60
00:04:14,306 --> 00:04:15,826
Do you know who I am?

61
00:04:15,906 --> 00:04:17,026
Who are you?

62
00:04:17,106 --> 00:04:19,546
Threatening the officer,
I'll arrest you too

63
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:20,786
Let's go

64
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,466
Wait

65
00:04:22,786 --> 00:04:25,186
Chief Liu,
you've come in good time, they...

66
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,466
What do you want?

67
00:04:26,586 --> 00:04:29,186
We are here to arrest these outlaws

68
00:04:29,746 --> 00:04:31,266
Who asked you to?

69
00:04:31,386 --> 00:04:32,826
Right

70
00:04:33,786 --> 00:04:36,106
The royal court has
decreed against gambling

71
00:04:37,746 --> 00:04:38,746
Since your men are here

72
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:41,106
help us take them back

73
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:44,866
Wait, though there's the decree

74
00:04:44,946 --> 00:04:48,786
the official document hasn't arrived

75
00:04:48,906 --> 00:04:51,786
Gambling is still legal, let them go

76
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:53,707
Chief Liu

77
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,627
They have ruined many lives
with their gambling racket

78
00:04:55,707 --> 00:04:56,787
should we let them go just like this?

79
00:04:56,907 --> 00:04:58,587
Do as I say

80
00:04:58,707 --> 00:05:02,027
Do you have respect for the law?

81
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:03,987
You dare to refuse an order?

82
00:05:04,107 --> 00:05:05,267
No...

83
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,747
Forget it, insubordination is
a cardinal mistake

84
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:09,907
For your any special operatives
in the future

85
00:05:10,027 --> 00:05:12,907
let me approve it first

86
00:05:12,987 --> 00:05:13,387
Let's go

87
00:05:13,507 --> 00:05:14,347
Yes

88
00:05:14,467 --> 00:05:15,547
Forget it

89
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:20,187
Catch the thief

90
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:22,627
Stop, don't move

91
00:05:24,747 --> 00:05:25,707
Don't run

92
00:05:26,107 --> 00:05:27,067
Stand still

93
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:28,547
Don't run

94
00:05:29,387 --> 00:05:30,907
Stand still

95
00:05:31,027 --> 00:05:32,187
Still wanna run?

96
00:05:39,108 --> 00:05:41,268
Stealing my things, come over here

97
00:05:41,348 --> 00:05:42,308
Don't move

98
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:45,028
You dare mess with me

99
00:05:45,108 --> 00:05:46,628
He's only a petty thief

100
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,508
why all the fuss?

101
00:05:48,588 --> 00:05:50,228
What are you grumbling about?

102
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:53,268
We're lawfully nabbing a thief,
none of your business

103
00:05:56,308 --> 00:05:58,108
How many times have you stolen?

104
00:05:58,228 --> 00:05:58,868
Once

105
00:05:58,948 --> 00:06:01,868
Once? You want to lie to me?

106
00:06:03,548 --> 00:06:05,348
Kneel... hold your head

107
00:06:05,468 --> 00:06:06,548
Sir, how can I get on with my business?

108
00:06:06,668 --> 00:06:08,188
Stop shouting... you are his accomplice?

109
00:06:08,308 --> 00:06:08,828
No

110
00:06:08,908 --> 00:06:10,428
No? Then what are you shouting at?

111
00:06:12,908 --> 00:06:13,868
What did he steal?

112
00:06:13,988 --> 00:06:15,548
He stole my potato

113
00:06:18,108 --> 00:06:19,068
Potato

114
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:21,429
Stealing potato

115
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,869
He's just stealing potato, let him go

116
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:26,509
How can he be released just like that

117
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:28,309
Sir, please give me a chance, let me go

118
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:31,829
Take him back to the yamen
(magistrate's office)

119
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:33,589
"Ferocious Leopard Garrison"

120
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:36,189
I shouldn't be the only one
to pay for his meal

121
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:39,549
Come, let's split it

122
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:43,069
Have you finished eating yet?

123
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:45,469
Yes, I'm full now... haven't eaten for days

124
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,389
Fatty, we want to teach you a lesson

125
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:52,949
this time we catch you

126
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:55,629
Don't steal again, leave

127
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:58,269
Thank you, Sir

128
00:07:00,109 --> 00:07:01,029
Who are you?

129
00:07:01,549 --> 00:07:03,669
Chief Liu, he stole a potato

130
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,750
We've already taught him a lesson

131
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,710
and are letting him go now

132
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,550
What? How can you release a thief?

133
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,510
Arrest him

134
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,950
Sir, please let me go

135
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,830
Chief Liu

136
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,270
Are there any unresolved cases recently?

137
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,630
Two burglary cases and three robberies

138
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,790
Right

139
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,510
Fatty, you must be the one behind them

140
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,270
Not me

141
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,390
Aren't you going to admit?

142
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,390
I didn't do it, why should I admit?

143
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,310
You dare talk back

144
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,870
Chief Liu, please check it out first

145
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,430
Think I need advice from you?

146
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,150
Fatty, stop lying

147
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,190
you'd better confess

148
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,910
I didn't do it, why should I?

149
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,910
Will you admit or not?

150
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,631
I didn't do it, why should I admit?

151
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,031
No?

152
00:07:49,991 --> 00:07:50,911
Will you admit or not?

153
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:56,351
Alright, I admit... stop beating, I admit

154
00:07:57,471 --> 00:07:59,551
What are you looking at? Lock him up

155
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:01,831
Detain these two

156
00:08:02,311 --> 00:08:06,591
Get in, go... Hurry

157
00:08:09,551 --> 00:08:10,591
Where's the document?

158
00:08:11,911 --> 00:08:13,071
Alright, you come in

159
00:08:13,151 --> 00:08:13,711
Go in

160
00:08:13,831 --> 00:08:16,271
Come over, sign the document

161
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:30,391
What did you do... so as to be arrested?

162
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:31,632
Arson

163
00:08:31,992 --> 00:08:32,912
Where are you from?

164
00:08:32,992 --> 00:08:34,272
From the Green Dragon Town

165
00:08:36,312 --> 00:08:37,552
You know the rules here?

166
00:08:37,672 --> 00:08:38,992
I do...

167
00:08:52,592 --> 00:08:55,032
Next, go over

168
00:08:57,032 --> 00:08:57,872
What crime have you committed?

169
00:08:57,952 --> 00:08:59,432
Stealing

170
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:00,672
Where are you from?

171
00:09:00,752 --> 00:09:03,192
Nowhere, I'm from here

172
00:09:03,312 --> 00:09:04,712
Do you know the rules?

173
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:05,752
No

174
00:09:06,152 --> 00:09:06,552
Beat him

175
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:07,512
Yes

176
00:09:08,592 --> 00:09:10,192
Stop, what are you doing?

177
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:13,432
Teach him a lesson

178
00:09:13,992 --> 00:09:17,233
He's here in jail not to be
your whipping boy

179
00:09:20,353 --> 00:09:21,833
Are you new here?

180
00:09:22,193 --> 00:09:25,353
Yes, we've just graduated

181
00:09:26,113 --> 00:09:30,073
Newcomer, there's some money for you

182
00:09:38,753 --> 00:09:43,473
Brother, there's some money for you

183
00:09:43,993 --> 00:09:44,873
Take it

184
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,073
You are trying to pick on me

185
00:09:50,153 --> 00:09:52,513
Brother, if I were picking on you

186
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:53,913
I'll simply lock you up

187
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:55,793
What? You gonna lock me up?

188
00:09:55,913 --> 00:09:57,073
Needless to say

189
00:09:57,193 --> 00:10:00,274
Bribing officials,
blackmailing inmates, using

190
00:10:00,354 --> 00:10:02,074
illegal torture;
these are enough to convict you

191
00:10:03,194 --> 00:10:05,354
What are you laughing at?
Hand the prisoner over to me

192
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:06,994
I can do whatever I like

193
00:10:08,914 --> 00:10:10,714
Are there any laws in here?

194
00:10:10,834 --> 00:10:14,914
This is my turf, my fist is the law

195
00:10:16,994 --> 00:10:17,794
Stop beating

196
00:10:18,154 --> 00:10:19,114
Get lost

197
00:10:20,194 --> 00:10:21,594
I've told you to stop beating,
didn't you hear that?

198
00:10:21,714 --> 00:10:23,034
None of your business

199
00:10:24,794 --> 00:10:25,714
Stop

200
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:28,354
Stop beating

201
00:10:28,474 --> 00:10:29,554
Don't move

202
00:10:29,674 --> 00:10:30,354
It's just a misunderstanding

203
00:10:30,474 --> 00:10:31,314
Damn you

204
00:10:31,434 --> 00:10:33,074
Come over... Stop beating

205
00:10:33,194 --> 00:10:33,954
Are you alright?

206
00:10:34,074 --> 00:10:37,954
You bastard, how dare you go against me

207
00:10:38,474 --> 00:10:40,074
It's just misunderstanding

208
00:10:40,154 --> 00:10:42,354
Never mind... let's go

209
00:10:43,315 --> 00:10:46,595
Stand still, you can't walk away
just like that

210
00:10:46,715 --> 00:10:48,995
What do you want? Kill us?

211
00:10:49,355 --> 00:10:51,395
Or put us into prison?

212
00:10:51,515 --> 00:10:53,355
In case you are here one day

213
00:10:53,475 --> 00:10:54,755
I'll make you pay for it

214
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,035
You too had better be careful

215
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:57,515
If you break any laws in my territory

216
00:10:57,635 --> 00:11:00,075
I won't let you get off so easily,
let's go

217
00:11:10,115 --> 00:11:11,235
"Fu Yuan Bank"

218
00:11:12,155 --> 00:11:13,435
Take care

219
00:11:15,755 --> 00:11:17,275
Give me some change

220
00:11:17,355 --> 00:11:18,715
Just a moment please

221
00:11:31,116 --> 00:11:32,876
Don't move...

222
00:11:34,116 --> 00:11:36,876
Don't move, everyone

223
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:41,436
Go over, squat on the ground

224
00:11:42,396 --> 00:11:45,916
Put it in, hurry

225
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:51,316
It's hot, come and have some tea, here...

226
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,316
Sir, you...

227
00:11:54,956 --> 00:11:57,036
What? Do I have to pay first?

228
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:57,836
I don't mean that

229
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,116
You pay him

230
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:01,036
Pay him

231
00:12:01,116 --> 00:12:02,316
Me paying again

232
00:12:03,476 --> 00:12:04,116
How much?

233
00:12:04,236 --> 00:12:05,076
3 cents

234
00:12:05,156 --> 00:12:06,876
Forget it...

235
00:12:06,996 --> 00:12:07,956
Thank you...

236
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:09,076
Wait for me

237
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:10,997
Why do I have to pay the bill everytime?

238
00:12:11,317 --> 00:12:15,317
Get a brass gong

239
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:16,837
Run

240
00:12:17,517 --> 00:12:19,837
Help, robbery

241
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:20,917
Stand still

242
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:26,717
Don't run

243
00:12:27,237 --> 00:12:28,757
Stand still

244
00:13:23,318 --> 00:13:25,718
Don't run

245
00:13:28,158 --> 00:13:29,038
Run

246
00:13:31,638 --> 00:13:34,518
Bastard, what a nerve

247
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:42,279
You want to beat him to death?

248
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,639
This rascal, I can beat him even harder

249
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:48,519
We must observe the law,
bring him back, go

250
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:51,999
Turn a blind eye, brother

251
00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:53,679
Let's split it, okay?

252
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:54,919
What do you take me for?

253
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:57,519
Why are you so foolish
to turn down the money?

254
00:13:57,599 --> 00:13:58,479
Bastard

255
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:02,039
You're right, must beat him up

256
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:04,039
Go...

257
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,120
Who put that money in my drawer?

258
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,200
Who did it?

259
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,680
Who knows, just take it

260
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,400
I've got some too

261
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,000
Bring it over

262
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,480
If I knew who did that

263
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,880
I won't spare him

264
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,560
It's alright, you can go

265
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,560
Thank you

266
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,160
Stand still

267
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,880
The real chief has run away

268
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,560
I let him go so he could be the bait

269
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,440
Release him

270
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,001
No, just now he wanted to kill me

271
00:15:07,121 --> 00:15:08,601
Did he?

272
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:11,041
Chief Liu, he's the leader,
don't let him go

273
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:12,921
Bastard, you are a newcomer,
you know nothing

274
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,521
Didn't you see the money in your drawer?

275
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:17,641
What? You put that in

276
00:15:17,721 --> 00:15:19,121
You took the money,
what are you shouting at

277
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:20,561
This is dirty money

278
00:15:20,681 --> 00:15:21,841
I don't want it

279
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,921
What an idiot!

280
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,001
What did you say?

281
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:27,241
Don't be so reckless

282
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:29,481
Chief Liu, you are sheltering a criminal

283
00:15:29,601 --> 00:15:32,241
Who's the boss here?

284
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:38,361
Damn, who would accept this sort of thing

285
00:15:38,961 --> 00:15:40,321
I might as well quit

286
00:15:42,481 --> 00:15:43,921
Pick it up

287
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:45,001
What for?

288
00:15:45,121 --> 00:15:47,641
We can't do anything
against these bastards

289
00:15:47,721 --> 00:15:49,321
and rid the people of oppression

290
00:15:49,441 --> 00:15:51,002
our hands are tied

291
00:15:51,122 --> 00:15:52,602
How could we do our job?

292
00:15:52,722 --> 00:15:53,882
I am the same as you

293
00:15:54,002 --> 00:15:55,682
He'll be happy if we quit

294
00:15:55,802 --> 00:15:57,482
If you do that, you are giving in to him

295
00:15:57,562 --> 00:15:59,402
This is exactly what they want

296
00:16:12,402 --> 00:16:13,682
Put that on

297
00:16:18,082 --> 00:16:20,122
Do you want to get rid of these bastards?

298
00:16:20,482 --> 00:16:21,202
Of course

299
00:16:21,322 --> 00:16:22,962
Good, put it on for the time being

300
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:26,242
then we could help the people
get rid of oppression

301
00:16:34,843 --> 00:16:35,403
Anyhow

302
00:16:35,523 --> 00:16:37,043
We have to stick to our principles

303
00:16:37,123 --> 00:16:40,403
Three in one as long as we live

304
00:16:40,523 --> 00:16:42,083
Fight for justice

305
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,803
Weed out the wicked and
let the people live in peace

306
00:16:49,203 --> 00:16:51,523
The three of us will
join force together hereafter

307
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:53,683
We'll all share the bliss

308
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,723
and I'll face the crisis, cheers

309
00:16:55,843 --> 00:16:56,763
Cheers

310
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:04,803
What's going on?

311
00:17:11,843 --> 00:17:12,723
Let's go

312
00:17:22,324 --> 00:17:23,964
Arrest them all

313
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,684
don't get in our way

314
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:28,124
Arrest them

315
00:17:36,324 --> 00:17:37,484
Look

316
00:17:41,484 --> 00:17:42,484
So absurd

317
00:17:42,564 --> 00:17:44,404
Arresting hawkers but not the gamblers

318
00:17:44,524 --> 00:17:46,084
What are you doing? Help to arrest them

319
00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:49,644
Life is difficult,
don't push them too hard

320
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:51,484
You dare to defy order?

321
00:17:52,484 --> 00:17:53,764
Do it

322
00:17:53,884 --> 00:17:56,044
Do you want to get fired?

323
00:17:57,004 --> 00:17:59,444
We lose if we argue with him, forget it...

324
00:17:59,804 --> 00:18:01,525
If you are scared, go and help them

325
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:04,925
Constable Liu, if you are capable

326
00:18:05,005 --> 00:18:07,925
why don't you capture that wanted criminal

327
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:09,845
Go

328
00:18:09,925 --> 00:18:11,045
If worse comes to worst, I'll quit

329
00:18:15,605 --> 00:18:17,725
You'll learn not to mess with me

330
00:18:20,405 --> 00:18:21,085
You haven't paid

331
00:18:21,165 --> 00:18:22,245
Damn you

332
00:18:25,485 --> 00:18:26,525
What are you doing?

333
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:29,845
Buy some bananas

334
00:18:29,925 --> 00:18:30,885
Madam

335
00:18:32,765 --> 00:18:35,445
Money... These bastards

336
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:37,325
are bullies

337
00:18:37,445 --> 00:18:39,685
I must take them to court

338
00:18:39,765 --> 00:18:40,885
What's the point of taking them to court

339
00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:43,965
They are from the magistrate

340
00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:49,486
Madam... Of all people

341
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:52,086
you have to marry an official

342
00:18:52,206 --> 00:18:55,686
this is not the acceptable thing to do

343
00:19:09,886 --> 00:19:10,966
Uncle Cheung

344
00:19:14,206 --> 00:19:15,406
Uncle

345
00:19:18,486 --> 00:19:19,486
You're back?

346
00:19:19,606 --> 00:19:20,086
Yes

347
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,406
What are you two playing at?

348
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:24,486
What are you doing? Go... go home

349
00:19:29,927 --> 00:19:31,607
Congratulation
- You're too kind...

350
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,207
Thank you

351
00:19:35,247 --> 00:19:37,487
You're back, come to my house
and have a drink

352
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:39,287
I'll go change first

353
00:19:39,407 --> 00:19:41,367
Congratulations, today is your birthday

354
00:19:41,487 --> 00:19:43,487
Let's celebrate

355
00:19:44,127 --> 00:19:46,127
This kid is getting more and more like me

356
00:19:46,847 --> 00:19:50,727
Of course. If not,
that will be a big problem

357
00:19:51,087 --> 00:19:52,247
What's the problem?

358
00:19:52,327 --> 00:19:53,727
Dear, he said this kid...

359
00:19:53,807 --> 00:19:55,207
Nothing... I was saying that tonight

360
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,127
we have to drink to our hearts' content

361
00:19:57,647 --> 00:19:59,687
I'll change my clothes first,
and I'll come by later

362
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:00,407
Hurry

363
00:20:00,527 --> 00:20:01,487
Hurry

364
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:07,167
Xiu Lian

365
00:20:09,927 --> 00:20:13,608
Xiu Lian, what are you doing?

366
00:20:13,728 --> 00:20:14,808
Nothing

367
00:20:14,928 --> 00:20:16,688
Don't lie to me

368
00:20:16,808 --> 00:20:18,368
What have you suffered?

369
00:20:18,488 --> 00:20:19,928
Tell me

370
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:24,008
Why do you have to work as a constable?

371
00:20:24,328 --> 00:20:25,408
What's wrong with that?

372
00:20:25,528 --> 00:20:27,408
Everyone hates you

373
00:20:29,288 --> 00:20:30,568
As long as we are upright

374
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,608
what's to be afraid of, never mind them

375
00:20:32,728 --> 00:20:35,928
But the neighbours...

376
00:20:37,088 --> 00:20:39,528
I know you have suffered

377
00:20:39,608 --> 00:20:42,928
If we bear a clear conscience,
people will respect us

378
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,688
Brother He... urgent call

379
00:20:44,768 --> 00:20:46,488
All constables report to
the station immediately

380
00:20:46,608 --> 00:20:47,088
What happened?

381
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,288
Bandit Sun Long has appeared at last and

382
00:20:48,368 --> 00:20:50,408
is fighting with our men
at the Temple of Chivalry

383
00:20:50,528 --> 00:20:50,928
You go back first

384
00:20:51,048 --> 00:20:51,768
Alright

385
00:20:54,928 --> 00:20:55,688
Zhong Heng

386
00:20:55,808 --> 00:20:57,729
I'll come back soon

387
00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:02,929
What? Today is my birthday

388
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:04,729
My husband has taken leave

389
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:05,449
I know

390
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:07,889
But this is an order from the top

391
00:21:07,969 --> 00:21:09,489
Never mind him, let's go in

392
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:12,089
Madam, this is official business,
he must go

393
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:13,289
If he doesn't

394
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:14,489
he might be fired

395
00:21:14,569 --> 00:21:15,289
I don't care

396
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:16,889
Just as well he is rid of this job

397
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:17,929
Many friends and relatives are here
for your birthday

398
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:19,049
How could you leave?

399
00:21:19,129 --> 00:21:20,289
Go in and entertain them, okay?

400
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:21,529
Ying Hao, don't go

401
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:22,489
I'll be right back

402
00:21:22,569 --> 00:21:23,409
Go

403
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:26,009
Ying Hao

404
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:29,209
I swear I'll never marry
an official in my next life

405
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:38,649
You are so capable
when arresting the hawkers, go

406
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,770
You're here just in time, go

407
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:11,090
Go away, or I'll kill him

408
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,730
Charge in right now

409
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,330
Then the hostage will be in danger

410
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,850
Never mind him;
Don't wanna score some brownie points?

411
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,411
It's dangerous to charge in like this

412
00:22:25,531 --> 00:22:27,931
Who's in charge here, you or me?

413
00:22:28,051 --> 00:22:29,931
Why don't we launch a surprise attack?

414
00:22:30,011 --> 00:22:33,811
Good, but you might not have the ability

415
00:22:34,931 --> 00:22:37,451
Come, let's show him how good we are

416
00:22:39,731 --> 00:22:41,491
Brother He, be careful

417
00:22:44,691 --> 00:22:46,811
We plan to charge in separately

418
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:49,691
once we extract the hostage,
charge in immediately

419
00:22:49,771 --> 00:22:50,371
Right

420
00:22:50,491 --> 00:22:51,331
Let's go

421
00:23:28,252 --> 00:23:31,692
Sun Long, you've been surrounded

422
00:23:31,812 --> 00:23:33,052
you can't escape

423
00:23:33,132 --> 00:23:35,132
Come out and surrender

424
00:23:35,532 --> 00:23:36,572
Come in if you dare

425
00:23:36,692 --> 00:23:38,012
The worst is we'll all die together

426
00:23:38,132 --> 00:23:39,092
Don't be rash

427
00:23:39,172 --> 00:23:40,932
we can talk this through

428
00:23:42,012 --> 00:23:42,932
What's to talk about?

429
00:23:43,052 --> 00:23:45,292
Would you let me go?

430
00:23:46,732 --> 00:23:49,932
Don't take me as a fool

431
00:23:50,052 --> 00:23:52,093
Don't be such a coward

432
00:23:52,213 --> 00:23:54,133
come on out if you have guts

433
00:23:55,013 --> 00:23:56,253
Save the bull shit

434
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:58,413
Give me a horse and some money

435
00:23:58,533 --> 00:24:00,333
or I'll kill him

436
00:24:06,493 --> 00:24:08,773
Don't come near or you'll die

437
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:25,293
Careful

438
00:24:34,653 --> 00:24:37,934
Brother He...

439
00:24:38,134 --> 00:24:39,094
Quick

440
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:58,094
Come and save him, quick

441
00:25:02,974 --> 00:25:04,614
Hurry

442
00:25:06,574 --> 00:25:08,894
Come men, hurry

443
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,334
Chief, let's charge in now

444
00:25:10,414 --> 00:25:13,494
No, the hostage is still inside

445
00:25:13,934 --> 00:25:15,614
Let's see how good

446
00:25:15,734 --> 00:25:17,934
the three of them are

447
00:25:18,054 --> 00:25:19,535
Come, men

448
00:25:55,815 --> 00:25:56,975
Ying Hao

449
00:26:09,816 --> 00:26:10,736
Stop him

450
00:26:11,816 --> 00:26:13,056
Get out of my way

451
00:26:13,136 --> 00:26:14,296
Stop

452
00:26:14,376 --> 00:26:15,456
Take him away

453
00:26:15,536 --> 00:26:16,096
Yes

454
00:26:16,216 --> 00:26:19,296
I want to kill him... out of my way

455
00:26:19,376 --> 00:26:21,776
Shut up, the law will deal with him

456
00:26:21,896 --> 00:26:23,856
How could you punish him on your own terms

457
00:26:24,776 --> 00:26:25,296
Let's go

458
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:26,416
Yes

459
00:26:31,536 --> 00:26:32,416
Are you alright?

460
00:26:32,536 --> 00:26:34,096
Yes, just shaken up

461
00:26:34,216 --> 00:26:34,896
I thought I'm finished this time

462
00:26:34,976 --> 00:26:37,336
You were lucky

463
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:11,337
Chief Liu

464
00:27:13,817 --> 00:27:14,657
Chief Liu, what is it?

465
00:27:14,737 --> 00:27:15,737
I want to see Lord Ge

466
00:27:15,857 --> 00:27:17,497
Please wait, I'll announce you

467
00:27:20,177 --> 00:27:21,697
Sir, Chief Liu wants to see you

468
00:27:21,817 --> 00:27:23,497
on a matter of utmost importance

469
00:27:23,617 --> 00:27:25,257
Damn, tell him I also have
important matters on hand

470
00:27:25,337 --> 00:27:28,497
and ask him to get lost

471
00:27:28,617 --> 00:27:29,097
Go on

472
00:27:29,177 --> 00:27:29,977
Yes

473
00:27:30,577 --> 00:27:31,658
Chief Liu, you...

474
00:27:31,738 --> 00:27:35,938
Sir, Sun Long the robber has been caught

475
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:37,938
So what? Leave me alone

476
00:27:38,018 --> 00:27:39,938
But on hearing the news his brothers

477
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:43,018
have come for a petition

478
00:27:43,138 --> 00:27:46,258
Damn, I am busy

479
00:27:46,618 --> 00:27:48,858
They said it's inconvenient
in the day time

480
00:27:48,938 --> 00:27:52,338
Looks like they have brought gifts

481
00:28:02,018 --> 00:28:06,458
Wei Wu

482
00:28:06,538 --> 00:28:08,338
Bring the prisoner

483
00:28:15,939 --> 00:28:19,579
Sun Long has killed an official
and is inexcusable

484
00:28:20,019 --> 00:28:23,459
but considering it was self defence

485
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:26,459
he'll be imprisoned for 3 months

486
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:27,659
Thank you, your honour

487
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,820
Brother He

488
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,820
Don't be like this

489
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,540
Leave me alone

490
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,260
Keep calm

491
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,460
Keep calm

492
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,620
Our job is to get rid of outlaws

493
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,220
But they are doing quite the contrary

494
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,260
I'll fight them to the end

495
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,621
Brother He, Ying Hao's death

496
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:44,861
is a result of Chief Liu's treachery

497
00:29:44,941 --> 00:29:47,261
He's on to us the whole time

498
00:29:47,341 --> 00:29:49,181
how could we prevail?

499
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:52,101
So are you saying we should give up?

500
00:29:52,181 --> 00:29:55,541
How could we face Ying Hao? Speak...

501
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:07,501
If we fought to the end

502
00:30:07,581 --> 00:30:09,781
would you be with me?

503
00:30:12,381 --> 00:30:16,301
The officials have great power

504
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:19,501
let's be wise and preserve our lives

505
00:30:19,581 --> 00:30:22,541
What?

506
00:30:23,941 --> 00:30:25,661
Have you forgotten

507
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,502
how the three of us swore

508
00:30:27,582 --> 00:30:28,742
to protect each other?

509
00:30:28,862 --> 00:30:31,982
Have you forgotten our ideals
for being a constable?

510
00:30:34,062 --> 00:30:41,102
Yes, but ideals and reality
are two different things

511
00:30:41,182 --> 00:30:43,862
In this lawless society

512
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:46,142
justice is a sham

513
00:30:46,502 --> 00:30:48,742
Justice always prevails;

514
00:30:48,862 --> 00:30:52,622
It's just that some people are cowards

515
00:30:52,742 --> 00:30:55,462
making justice a sham

516
00:30:56,102 --> 00:30:58,542
I am not afraid of death

517
00:30:58,622 --> 00:31:01,542
If I could get rid of evil and crimes

518
00:31:01,662 --> 00:31:03,702
I'd do it

519
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:09,382
Ying Hao's kind of death was for nothing

520
00:31:09,502 --> 00:31:12,383
and would only produce widows and orphans

521
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:15,463
was it worth anything?

522
00:32:27,744 --> 00:32:28,224
Madam

523
00:32:28,344 --> 00:32:30,584
Let me go...

524
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:35,544
I only became a widow

525
00:32:35,664 --> 00:32:40,225
and my child became an orphan
just because of you

526
00:32:41,145 --> 00:32:43,465
I know how you feel

527
00:32:44,305 --> 00:32:45,625
Take care of yourself

528
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:50,385
Let me go, Ying Hao will never forgive you

529
00:32:52,585 --> 00:32:53,905
Come in

530
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:18,505
Bring it here

531
00:33:22,506 --> 00:33:26,346
Your husband died young

532
00:33:26,426 --> 00:33:29,266
I don't think you have
enough money to bury him

533
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,586
Take it

534
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:36,866
Let's go

535
00:33:36,946 --> 00:33:37,866
Okay

536
00:33:38,746 --> 00:33:39,586
Wait

537
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:42,546
Though we are poor

538
00:33:42,626 --> 00:33:44,346
we don't want your charity

539
00:33:45,466 --> 00:33:47,426
You dare to refuse it

540
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:51,226
You do all this evil for money

541
00:33:51,346 --> 00:33:55,106
we want no part of it, go away

542
00:33:55,186 --> 00:33:57,386
Damn, let's go

543
00:33:59,986 --> 00:34:02,706
This is a small token
from us brothers, please take it

544
00:34:03,106 --> 00:34:04,026
My husband's life

545
00:34:04,146 --> 00:34:05,467
cannot be bought by money

546
00:34:05,547 --> 00:34:06,027
Madam

547
00:34:06,147 --> 00:34:08,107
Luo Zhang, let's go

548
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,947
Take care

549
00:34:14,627 --> 00:34:16,347
You really want to go?

550
00:34:18,787 --> 00:34:20,747
Where are you off to?

551
00:34:20,867 --> 00:34:24,107
Back to my hometown, to raise my kid

552
00:34:24,227 --> 00:34:26,907
and live a simple life

553
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:30,627
Why be so pessimistic?

554
00:34:34,027 --> 00:34:36,547
I am a woman

555
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:42,387
In this macho world

556
00:34:42,507 --> 00:34:44,827
how would I survive without a husband?

557
00:34:47,747 --> 00:34:51,908
Besides, this society thrives
on power, not reason

558
00:34:52,348 --> 00:34:55,148
I want to leave here

559
00:34:55,268 --> 00:34:58,628
and leave the painful memories behind

560
00:34:59,628 --> 00:35:04,068
I made some clothes for your kid

561
00:35:04,148 --> 00:35:05,308
Do take them

562
00:35:42,469 --> 00:35:43,789
Take care

563
00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:48,349
Thank you...

564
00:35:58,269 --> 00:36:01,509
I'm going, you should be at peace

565
00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:05,709
Taking up a good cause
for the people, my husband died

566
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:08,389
who could give him back to me!

567
00:36:12,549 --> 00:36:13,749
It's not your fault

568
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:15,629
why blame yourself

569
00:36:15,989 --> 00:36:18,790
If it weren't for me why would he die?

570
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,910
Why don't you give up being a constable

571
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,750
Hey, let's both quit &
return to our hometown together

572
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,910
I want to be an upright official

573
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,670
so everyone would know that

574
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,270
righteous officials still exist

575
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,350
What difference would it make?

576
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:32,510
All the same they'd end up
as victims of evil ministers

577
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,350
You need say no more

578
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:34,830
I have made up my mind

579
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,510
Won't work unless our lot
mixes in with the bad guys

580
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,510
What are you saying?

581
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,310
As they say:
'Birds of a feather flock together'

582
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:43,190
If not, you'd be the next

583
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,870
A hero is upright

584
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:48,150
he could lose his life, but not his honour

585
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,510
I'll not give in

586
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,830
You risk your life to catch criminals

587
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:55,390
yet a murderer is only imprisoned
for 3 months

588
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,270
how are you going to fight against them?

589
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,951
Though the law and justice didn't work

590
00:37:02,031 --> 00:37:03,631
my fist is my justice

591
00:37:03,751 --> 00:37:05,471
Help...

592
00:37:07,471 --> 00:37:08,391
Let go

593
00:37:10,831 --> 00:37:12,231
Help

594
00:37:15,751 --> 00:37:19,511
Help, let go, don't

595
00:37:23,551 --> 00:37:25,111
Let go

596
00:37:26,951 --> 00:37:28,151
Help

597
00:37:29,711 --> 00:37:30,671
Don't

598
00:37:31,551 --> 00:37:32,311
Let go

599
00:37:37,311 --> 00:37:38,591
Help

600
00:37:41,831 --> 00:37:46,472
Help, let go

601
00:37:47,752 --> 00:37:49,032
Help

602
00:37:52,992 --> 00:37:53,952
Don't

603
00:37:59,072 --> 00:38:01,272
Let go, help

604
00:38:08,592 --> 00:38:10,672
Help

605
00:38:17,432 --> 00:38:19,272
Let go

606
00:38:22,672 --> 00:38:23,632
Don't run

607
00:38:25,352 --> 00:38:26,632
Don't run

608
00:38:35,953 --> 00:38:38,313
Come...

609
00:39:06,513 --> 00:39:07,873
Miss

610
00:39:07,953 --> 00:39:11,113
Stand still...

611
00:39:11,793 --> 00:39:12,994
Miss

612
00:39:15,754 --> 00:39:16,874
Don't run

613
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,074
Halt

614
00:39:22,954 --> 00:39:23,474
Stop please

615
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:24,634
At worst I'll go to jail

616
00:39:24,754 --> 00:39:26,194
That'll be too good for you

617
00:39:30,594 --> 00:39:31,554
What do you want?

618
00:39:31,674 --> 00:39:33,434
Make you a cripple

619
00:39:49,834 --> 00:39:50,874
This is Chief Liu's territory

620
00:39:50,954 --> 00:39:52,074
Go to hell

621
00:39:54,514 --> 00:39:56,075
You again

622
00:39:57,715 --> 00:39:59,515
Stop... you are a mad dog

623
00:39:59,635 --> 00:40:02,635
Do you want to get fired?

624
00:40:03,955 --> 00:40:04,915
Are you blind?

625
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:07,315
I don't know what you are saying

626
00:40:07,435 --> 00:40:09,315
Stop pretending

627
00:40:11,755 --> 00:40:13,155
Don't be rash

628
00:40:13,275 --> 00:40:14,755
Rash? I'm going to arrest you

629
00:40:14,835 --> 00:40:16,755
You dare?

630
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:18,155
Well, can't I?

631
00:40:20,395 --> 00:40:21,555
He is barking up the wrong tree

632
00:40:21,675 --> 00:40:23,595
Right, we did our job for nothing

633
00:40:23,715 --> 00:40:25,595
we'll starve if we go on like this

634
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:26,435
Tell chief Liu

635
00:40:26,555 --> 00:40:27,875
Chief Liu, what should we do?

636
00:40:27,955 --> 00:40:28,795
Shut up

637
00:40:35,755 --> 00:40:37,715
Hard to believe I can't handle him

638
00:40:39,555 --> 00:40:41,396
Brother He, watch it

639
00:40:41,516 --> 00:40:43,636
you'll suffer for it
if you go against them

640
00:40:43,756 --> 00:40:45,076
We all die sooner or later

641
00:40:45,156 --> 00:40:47,196
It's up to fate to decide when

642
00:40:47,316 --> 00:40:49,076
but we must die a glorious death

643
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:50,436
and we should charter our destiny

644
00:40:50,556 --> 00:40:52,436
Brother He, agreed you can
go against the robbers

645
00:40:52,556 --> 00:40:54,196
but could you go against the officials?

646
00:40:54,596 --> 00:40:57,956
Haven't you heard of
'survival of the fittest'?

647
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:02,116
You of all people talk to me about that?

648
00:41:02,196 --> 00:41:03,636
You are a man

649
00:41:03,756 --> 00:41:04,596
why be afraid of them?

650
00:41:04,716 --> 00:41:06,156
I am not afraid

651
00:41:06,236 --> 00:41:09,156
I also had my ideals

652
00:41:09,236 --> 00:41:13,996
but is it worth dying in this

653
00:41:14,116 --> 00:41:15,836
world without justice?

654
00:41:16,156 --> 00:41:19,436
Besides, I have my family

655
00:41:19,556 --> 00:41:22,476
I... need to go on living

656
00:41:27,157 --> 00:41:29,597
If you are so afraid of
those corrupt officials

657
00:41:29,717 --> 00:41:32,677
why be a constable in the first place?

658
00:41:37,797 --> 00:41:42,157
I just wanted a job
and provide for my family

659
00:41:42,237 --> 00:41:45,557
Provide for family,
survival of the fittest

660
00:41:46,517 --> 00:41:47,877
From now onwards

661
00:41:47,957 --> 00:41:49,157
we'll go separate ways

662
00:41:49,277 --> 00:41:50,397
Brother He

663
00:41:50,637 --> 00:41:53,157
I won't be weak like you, shying away

664
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:55,917
As long as I live, I won't bow to evil

665
00:41:56,037 --> 00:41:57,637
Brother He...

666
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:32,438
Why did you want to see me?

667
00:42:32,558 --> 00:42:33,838
I...

668
00:42:34,358 --> 00:42:35,318
Please sit

669
00:42:46,118 --> 00:42:48,078
Just tell me

670
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:51,159
I... want to leave here

671
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:54,639
They want to force me to be a part of them

672
00:42:54,759 --> 00:42:57,119
I want to quit this job

673
00:42:58,839 --> 00:42:59,999
Just as well

674
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,119
But they won't let me go easily

675
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:06,119
I don't even dare to go home now

676
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:10,599
On my behalf please
hand this money to my family

677
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:13,959
and tell them I've left this place

678
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,719
and that I'll fetch them later

679
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:25,159
This is my resignation,
please hand it in for me

680
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,239
Why is my name there?

681
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:32,959
It's from me to you

682
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:35,840
Please tell Chief Liu

683
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,600
I don't want to get you involved

684
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,360
I'm going

685
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:45,960
Luo Zhang

686
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,080
Farewell and take care

687
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,280
Luo Zhang

688
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,040
Dear Brother Zhong Heng

689
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,520
Thank you for the drawings
of the treasury and

690
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,120
the guard posts

691
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,760
Further to discussion
we've decided to follow your plan

692
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,680
and storm the treasury on 15th of August

693
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,440
We look forward to your support

694
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,881
and enclose a hundred taels of gold

695
00:44:19,961 --> 00:44:22,121
You'll be further rewarded after the heist

696
00:44:22,241 --> 00:44:25,361
Quick... catch him

697
00:44:35,721 --> 00:44:36,321
Bring him back

698
00:44:36,441 --> 00:44:37,561
Yes

699
00:45:14,602 --> 00:45:15,682
You beast

700
00:45:15,762 --> 00:45:18,042
Why frame me?

701
00:45:20,202 --> 00:45:21,322
You have some guts

702
00:45:21,402 --> 00:45:23,762
you dare to rob the treasury

703
00:45:23,882 --> 00:45:24,522
Arrest him

704
00:45:24,602 --> 00:45:25,722
Yes

705
00:45:28,922 --> 00:45:30,082
Don't come near

706
00:45:30,162 --> 00:45:32,282
This is between Chief Liu and me

707
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:33,642
it's none of your business

708
00:45:33,762 --> 00:45:35,562
don't force my hand to kill

709
00:45:36,642 --> 00:45:38,922
Whoever gets him will be heavily rewarded

710
00:45:40,082 --> 00:45:41,082
Grab him

711
00:46:43,324 --> 00:46:44,524
Grab him

712
00:46:57,004 --> 00:46:59,324
Hurry

713
00:47:07,364 --> 00:47:08,524
You still want to resist arrest?

714
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:13,684
Bring him back

715
00:47:13,804 --> 00:47:14,765
Yes

716
00:47:15,725 --> 00:47:16,965
Let's go

717
00:47:29,445 --> 00:47:32,365
Sir, now that we're rid of him

718
00:47:32,445 --> 00:47:33,965
there'll be peace

719
00:47:34,085 --> 00:47:34,725
Yes

720
00:47:34,845 --> 00:47:37,485
It's all your good idea

721
00:47:37,565 --> 00:47:38,245
You're too kind

722
00:47:38,365 --> 00:47:40,765
Now we can do great things

723
00:47:40,845 --> 00:47:42,005
Yes

724
00:47:43,045 --> 00:47:46,205
He Zhong Heng was
looking for trouble by himself

725
00:47:46,325 --> 00:47:49,565
it's survival of the fittest

726
00:47:49,685 --> 00:47:52,125
he deserved to die

727
00:47:52,205 --> 00:47:53,165
Right...

728
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:57,165
How should we deal with him?

729
00:47:57,285 --> 00:47:58,926
I have my plans

730
00:48:00,566 --> 00:48:02,086
What are you doing?

731
00:48:02,206 --> 00:48:05,246
Nothing

732
00:48:05,926 --> 00:48:08,526
You did a great job this time

733
00:48:08,646 --> 00:48:10,926
This silver is for you

734
00:48:14,646 --> 00:48:16,326
What? Too little?

735
00:48:18,966 --> 00:48:20,646
You don't want it?

736
00:48:21,926 --> 00:48:24,726
Take it, many people don't get
this kind of a chance

737
00:48:24,806 --> 00:48:28,806
Thanks but no thanks

738
00:48:28,926 --> 00:48:32,446
I only hope
my family would be released soon

739
00:48:32,566 --> 00:48:34,126
I would be satisfied with that

740
00:48:34,246 --> 00:48:36,566
What?

741
00:48:36,686 --> 00:48:38,766
Why have you detained his whole family?

742
00:48:38,886 --> 00:48:40,246
One is enough

743
00:48:40,366 --> 00:48:41,206
Let them all go

744
00:48:41,326 --> 00:48:42,847
Yes...

745
00:48:44,367 --> 00:48:46,527
Luo Zhang, if you listen to me

746
00:48:46,647 --> 00:48:50,327
I'll be easy on you. As for your family

747
00:48:50,407 --> 00:48:51,887
I'll send them back

748
00:48:52,007 --> 00:48:53,607
don't worry

749
00:48:54,927 --> 00:48:57,287
It's okay, go

750
00:49:00,447 --> 00:49:01,727
Thank you

751
00:49:21,767 --> 00:49:23,767
Bring the prisoner

752
00:49:28,248 --> 00:49:29,928
As a constable

753
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:31,208
you break the law

754
00:49:31,328 --> 00:49:33,008
and conspire with robbers
to rob the treasury

755
00:49:33,128 --> 00:49:35,128
You're relieved of your post

756
00:49:35,488 --> 00:49:37,728
and sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment

757
00:49:37,848 --> 00:49:39,088
You cur

758
00:49:39,168 --> 00:49:40,328
Take him away at once

759
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:42,728
Take him away

760
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:52,688
Mr He, things change

761
00:49:52,888 --> 00:49:55,768
didn't you say you'll fix me?

762
00:49:55,848 --> 00:49:57,728
Well, come on

763
00:49:58,088 --> 00:49:59,488
Let me see how good you are

764
00:50:01,968 --> 00:50:04,728
Grab him here

765
00:50:07,208 --> 00:50:09,248
I said, once the prisoner is sent here

766
00:50:09,369 --> 00:50:12,769
I can do anything I like with him

767
00:50:13,489 --> 00:50:15,409
Understand?

768
00:50:17,049 --> 00:50:17,529
Bring him here

769
00:50:17,609 --> 00:50:18,449
Yes

770
00:50:19,769 --> 00:50:20,889
Get up

771
00:50:21,489 --> 00:50:22,249
Kneel

772
00:50:22,609 --> 00:50:24,689
Kneel...

773
00:50:24,769 --> 00:50:26,289
I kneel only to the heaven,
king and teacher

774
00:50:26,409 --> 00:50:27,809
not to a cur like you

775
00:50:27,929 --> 00:50:28,809
Beat him

776
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:37,329
Beat him till he kneels

777
00:50:37,449 --> 00:50:38,569
Yes

778
00:50:42,169 --> 00:50:43,489
Kneel

779
00:50:45,489 --> 00:50:46,849
With all your might

780
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:57,530
You go against yourself
when you go against me

781
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:04,610
Come on, just kill me

782
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:09,090
I am not through with you yet

783
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:12,330
Death would be easy for you, come, men

784
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:15,690
put him together with the prisoners

785
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:18,530
caught by him

786
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:23,330
Let them have a party with him

787
00:52:26,012 --> 00:52:26,772
Wait

788
00:52:27,292 --> 00:52:31,532
Don't kill him,
Chief Liu isn't through with him yet

789
00:52:31,652 --> 00:52:32,692
Let's go

790
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,532
I was imprisoned and hit in the groin

791
00:52:40,612 --> 00:52:42,092
You'll suffer the same thing today

792
00:52:44,492 --> 00:52:45,572
Stop

793
00:52:50,572 --> 00:52:54,012
What are you doing? Want to kill him?

794
00:52:54,132 --> 00:52:57,612
Dammit, aren't you human?

795
00:52:57,732 --> 00:53:01,012
Don't you see he is heavily wounded?

796
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:06,453
Go wash his wounds with your pee

797
00:53:28,173 --> 00:53:32,693
My turn to teach you a lesson

798
00:53:44,093 --> 00:53:45,093
Brother Loong

799
00:53:56,934 --> 00:53:57,934
Smells good

800
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:40,695
What are you doing?

801
00:54:42,215 --> 00:54:46,295
Stop

802
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:53,175
Let me go

803
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:00,015
Go and tell fifth master

804
00:55:00,135 --> 00:55:01,135
I want that bastard gotten rid of

805
00:55:01,255 --> 00:55:03,255
I'll pay whatever he wants

806
00:55:03,575 --> 00:55:05,015
Have you collected the goods?

807
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:05,815
Yes

808
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:07,895
Fifth master said
not to give him anything to eat

809
00:55:08,015 --> 00:55:09,415
Okay

810
00:55:18,776 --> 00:55:19,576
Move

811
00:55:21,256 --> 00:55:22,296
Go inside

812
00:56:19,857 --> 00:56:21,137
Speak up

813
00:56:21,217 --> 00:56:22,377
Thank you

814
00:56:29,657 --> 00:56:32,577
You...

815
00:56:40,977 --> 00:56:44,618
How could you fight against the officials?

816
00:56:49,418 --> 00:56:51,618
Why didn't you listen to me?

817
00:56:51,738 --> 00:56:54,218
In this corrupt society

818
00:56:54,338 --> 00:56:56,978
justice can't be gotten
with mere principles

819
00:56:58,258 --> 00:57:00,218
Well, I still have faith that

820
00:57:00,338 --> 00:57:01,738
justice will prevail

821
00:57:02,098 --> 00:57:04,258
If that were true

822
00:57:04,378 --> 00:57:05,938
you wouldn't be here now

823
00:57:06,058 --> 00:57:07,458
Ying Hao wouldn't have died for nothing

824
00:57:07,578 --> 00:57:09,858
Luo Zhang would not have sold himself out

825
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:14,178
Don't mention that bastard

826
00:57:14,778 --> 00:57:18,018
Did you know he was coerced?

827
00:57:18,138 --> 00:57:20,658
I said don't mention him

828
00:57:25,138 --> 00:57:28,499
What would you do if

829
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:30,139
you were the one who were
held hostage by that bastard?

830
00:57:35,859 --> 00:57:39,779
I'd rather die than be a dog

831
00:57:40,459 --> 00:57:42,739
Do you think the problem
will be solved just by dying?

832
00:57:46,419 --> 00:57:50,139
You are too selfish; ever thought about

833
00:57:50,219 --> 00:57:53,419
what would happen to me if you died?

834
00:57:58,459 --> 00:58:01,659
You'd better stay away
from here as far as possible

835
00:58:01,779 --> 00:58:03,139
Find someone and remarry

836
00:58:06,739 --> 00:58:08,619
Thirty years

837
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,540
I don't know if I'd live that long enough

838
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:19,740
Don't worry, I'll redress
an injustice for you

839
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:25,660
Redress? To those corrupt officials?

840
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:31,780
Of course not. There's an imperial envoy

841
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:33,940
who'll be coming here
to canvass the peoples' sentiment

842
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:36,620
I hear he is honest & righteous

843
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:39,180
I plan to present my case to him

844
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:42,180
No matter what happens,
you ought to survive

845
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,460
and testify against that corrupt official

846
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:49,740
Damn it, want to sue me?

847
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:53,020
Kill her

848
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:54,740
Help

849
00:58:58,381 --> 00:58:59,741
You want to run away?

850
00:59:09,301 --> 00:59:12,141
Let me down...

851
00:59:15,101 --> 00:59:16,661
Help

852
00:59:27,621 --> 00:59:29,101
Is there any law?
Murdering in broad daylight

853
00:59:29,221 --> 00:59:30,421
Report to the court immediately

854
00:59:30,981 --> 00:59:33,061
What are you looking at?

855
00:59:33,181 --> 00:59:34,301
Here...

856
00:59:36,901 --> 00:59:37,301
Where?

857
00:59:37,381 --> 00:59:38,181
Here...

858
00:59:38,301 --> 00:59:39,142
Hurry and go

859
00:59:41,142 --> 00:59:42,622
The official is here, hurry and go

860
00:59:48,462 --> 00:59:49,342
Come in and have a look

861
00:59:49,422 --> 00:59:52,382
They ran that way

862
00:59:52,462 --> 00:59:52,942
Follow me

863
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:53,942
Yes

864
00:59:56,702 --> 01:00:01,502
Good work, you'll all be rewarded

865
01:00:03,262 --> 01:00:05,742
It's been said that the imperial envoy

866
01:00:05,822 --> 01:00:07,662
will be here soon

867
01:00:07,782 --> 01:00:11,822
Families of the prisoners
planned to file complaints

868
01:00:12,382 --> 01:00:15,142
How should we handle them?

869
01:00:18,742 --> 01:00:20,942
Let's be ruthless

870
01:00:21,022 --> 01:00:23,703
I plan get rid of them

871
01:00:26,263 --> 01:00:29,983
Then more people will be killed?

872
01:00:30,103 --> 01:00:33,063
They have to be uprooted
to prevent future trouble;

873
01:00:33,183 --> 01:00:35,263
Especially that He Zhong Heng

874
01:00:38,423 --> 01:00:40,383
Sun Long

875
01:00:42,903 --> 01:00:46,943
What is it, don't you see I'm sleeping?

876
01:00:47,063 --> 01:00:48,543
Fifth master wants to see you

877
01:00:50,983 --> 01:00:52,343
Didn't you say that

878
01:00:52,463 --> 01:00:53,943
you want to kill He Zhong Heng
with your own hands

879
01:00:54,023 --> 01:00:55,903
and are willing to pay

880
01:00:57,223 --> 01:00:59,063
How much can you pay for that?

881
01:00:59,183 --> 01:01:01,583
As much as you want, how about that?

882
01:01:03,183 --> 01:01:05,143
Good...

883
01:01:05,223 --> 01:01:08,744
There will be a thorough clean up
in this prison

884
01:01:08,864 --> 01:01:11,384
These bamboo sticks are for your brothers

885
01:01:11,504 --> 01:01:13,504
Five hundred taels of silver each

886
01:01:13,904 --> 01:01:16,384
So expensive?

887
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:18,504
Immunity stick

888
01:02:29,665 --> 01:02:31,425
May heaven bless

889
01:02:31,545 --> 01:02:33,705
my wife could help exonerate me

890
01:02:37,346 --> 01:02:38,706
Take it

891
01:02:38,786 --> 01:02:39,666
Thank you

892
01:02:41,106 --> 01:02:41,946
Thank you

893
01:02:52,066 --> 01:02:53,106
What is it, constable He

894
01:02:53,226 --> 01:02:55,586
Are you comfortable staying here?

895
01:02:58,666 --> 01:02:59,706
What is it?

896
01:02:59,786 --> 01:03:02,266
Why didn't you greet your old friends

897
01:03:02,386 --> 01:03:04,546
I don't have friends
without integrity like you

898
01:03:05,146 --> 01:03:08,226
What's the price of integrity? Idiot

899
01:03:08,346 --> 01:03:09,826
I advised you before

900
01:03:09,946 --> 01:03:12,826
and you didn't listen to me

901
01:03:13,346 --> 01:03:15,306
Serves you right, you must regret this

902
01:03:15,426 --> 01:03:16,826
You beast

903
01:03:19,147 --> 01:03:20,587
Still trying to be put on airs

904
01:03:23,867 --> 01:03:26,787
You've deteriorated,
I'll fight you to the death

905
01:03:37,187 --> 01:03:38,667
It's all because of you

906
01:03:38,787 --> 01:03:41,747
that we haven't had
the chance of making a fast buck

907
01:03:41,827 --> 01:03:44,627
Let me thank you on behalf of the brothers

908
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:04,508
Calm down... listen to me

909
01:04:06,068 --> 01:04:07,948
Your wife is dead

910
01:04:08,908 --> 01:04:09,948
How come?

911
01:04:10,068 --> 01:04:11,708
Killed by Chief Liu

912
01:04:13,108 --> 01:04:14,668
Why?

913
01:04:14,788 --> 01:04:16,428
He wouldn't even let her go?

914
01:04:17,588 --> 01:04:18,988
Because she wanted to
file a complaint for you

915
01:04:37,868 --> 01:04:39,788
Beaten like this, as good as dead

916
01:04:39,868 --> 01:04:41,148
Never mind him, go

917
01:04:46,949 --> 01:04:50,109
If you have the chance to get out of here

918
01:04:50,189 --> 01:04:54,429
Go away as far as possible
and never come back

919
01:04:58,789 --> 01:05:01,909
Whether you could get out or not

920
01:05:01,989 --> 01:05:03,909
I've prepared for you at the temple

921
01:05:03,989 --> 01:05:06,629
some daily necessities

922
01:05:07,549 --> 01:05:10,349
I've been watched all day

923
01:05:10,429 --> 01:05:12,949
These are all I could bring to you

924
01:05:15,789 --> 01:05:17,149
Take care

925
01:05:20,269 --> 01:05:21,149
Luo Zhang

926
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:38,550
Be smart

927
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:08,910
I'll be out of prison in two days' time

928
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:10,150
Congratulations

929
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:11,510
Hurry and come back

930
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:13,671
Don't say unlucky things

931
01:06:31,191 --> 01:06:33,151
What are you doing?

932
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:35,671
I'll be out of the prison in two days

933
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:37,031
What are you doing?

934
01:06:40,711 --> 01:06:43,391
I'm not leaving...

935
01:06:49,511 --> 01:06:55,071
Why didn't you get them? I'm not leaving

936
01:06:56,751 --> 01:06:58,032
Please

937
01:06:59,792 --> 01:07:04,832
Master... spare me

938
01:07:06,152 --> 01:07:09,352
Master... spare me

939
01:07:11,232 --> 01:07:14,512
Go...

940
01:07:14,592 --> 01:07:20,712
I'm not going, let go of me, I'm not going

941
01:07:23,192 --> 01:07:26,712
I'm not going...

942
01:07:26,832 --> 01:07:28,792
Let go of me

943
01:07:31,192 --> 01:07:32,512
Please help

944
01:07:50,193 --> 01:07:54,353
I am the chief of robbers
and you are a constable

945
01:07:54,473 --> 01:07:56,753
What if you caught me?

946
01:07:56,833 --> 01:07:59,153
Tonight I'll be out of the prison

947
01:07:59,233 --> 01:08:01,473
and you have to die here

948
01:08:03,473 --> 01:08:05,273
You've made me blind

949
01:08:05,393 --> 01:08:06,553
and I have to take your life to pay for it

950
01:08:06,633 --> 01:08:09,393
You killed my brother,
who's going to pay for that?

951
01:08:09,513 --> 01:08:12,113
You still have a loud mouth

952
01:10:52,997 --> 01:10:56,797
Go over...

953
01:11:02,597 --> 01:11:05,557
Archers, ready

954
01:11:05,637 --> 01:11:06,557
Shoot

955
01:11:11,997 --> 01:11:13,477
Don't kill me

956
01:11:23,358 --> 01:11:24,238
Shoot

957
01:11:31,278 --> 01:11:32,398
Shoot

958
01:12:18,399 --> 01:12:19,559
It's alright in here

959
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:21,319
Get someone to pick up the bodies

960
01:12:21,399 --> 01:12:21,959
Yes

961
01:12:22,079 --> 01:12:22,959
Hurry and go

962
01:12:23,599 --> 01:12:24,639
Is Master Sun out yet?

963
01:12:24,759 --> 01:12:25,759
No

964
01:12:25,879 --> 01:12:26,759
Go and prepare some food

965
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:29,279
I must drink with Master Sun

966
01:12:32,199 --> 01:12:34,479
Four, five, six, big

967
01:12:34,599 --> 01:12:35,319
You lose

968
01:12:36,039 --> 01:12:37,319
Coming

969
01:12:37,399 --> 01:12:38,479
Go, be there right away

970
01:12:40,519 --> 01:12:42,279
Well? No more grudges?

971
01:13:31,721 --> 01:13:32,681
Feel better?

972
01:13:40,481 --> 01:13:41,361
Master He

973
01:13:51,041 --> 01:13:54,401
Master He, don't kill me

974
01:13:54,521 --> 01:13:57,561
I want you to know
what it feels like being tortured

975
01:13:58,241 --> 01:14:00,001
Master He, from tomorrow onwards

976
01:14:00,121 --> 01:14:03,761
I'll turn over a new leaf

977
01:14:04,361 --> 01:14:07,561
Master He, spare me, it's not my fault

978
01:14:07,641 --> 01:14:11,281
I just follow instructions

979
01:14:11,561 --> 01:14:12,441
Too late

980
01:14:34,882 --> 01:14:36,242
Send the carriage over

981
01:14:36,362 --> 01:14:37,882
Hurry

982
01:14:39,162 --> 01:14:40,442
Hurry

983
01:14:41,242 --> 01:14:43,962
Take it away,
bring the third carriage over

984
01:14:46,082 --> 01:14:50,522
Hurry... alright, hurry

985
01:15:00,603 --> 01:15:02,443
"Temple of Chivalry"

986
01:15:47,164 --> 01:15:48,644
You corrupt officer

987
01:16:15,284 --> 01:16:17,964
Help...

988
01:16:18,084 --> 01:16:20,404
What is it?

989
01:16:23,484 --> 01:16:25,564
Just had a nightmare, let's go...

990
01:16:25,684 --> 01:16:26,724
Yes

991
01:16:27,525 --> 01:16:27,965
Let's go

992
01:16:28,045 --> 01:16:28,885
Yes

993
01:16:49,485 --> 01:16:50,765
Attack

994
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:18,366
What to do?

995
01:17:18,446 --> 01:17:19,406
Call for help

996
01:17:19,806 --> 01:17:22,046
What are you doing here? Go

997
01:17:22,166 --> 01:17:23,686
Go

998
01:17:26,166 --> 01:17:27,446
Go

999
01:18:20,327 --> 01:18:21,487
See, another one got killed

1000
01:18:21,607 --> 01:18:23,967
Master, don't move, keep quiet

1001
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:22,050
You can't get away

1002
01:20:32,450 --> 01:20:34,570
Chase

1003
01:20:34,690 --> 01:20:36,890
Hurry...

1004
01:20:44,450 --> 01:20:47,010
Don't come over, or I'll kill him

1005
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:47,970
Don't be mistaken

1006
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:50,691
This is Chief Liu's idea,
I have nothing to do with it

1007
01:20:50,811 --> 01:20:51,771
Go

1008
01:20:53,371 --> 01:20:54,931
Hurry...

1009
01:20:55,811 --> 01:20:58,251
Don't follow me or I'll kill him

1010
01:20:58,611 --> 01:21:01,651
Go away, make way...

1011
01:21:06,011 --> 01:21:06,931
The Temple of Chivalry is up ahead

1012
01:21:07,011 --> 01:21:07,931
Take some men and ambush him

1013
01:21:08,011 --> 01:21:09,931
the rest will follow me

1014
01:21:31,331 --> 01:21:33,331
Stand still, catch him

1015
01:21:34,132 --> 01:21:35,332
You are coming over

1016
01:21:36,772 --> 01:21:37,732
Brother He

1017
01:21:38,412 --> 01:21:39,132
What is it?

1018
01:21:39,212 --> 01:21:40,292
Nothing

1019
01:21:45,012 --> 01:21:46,772
Don't come over

1020
01:21:46,892 --> 01:21:48,372
I have stayed alive till today

1021
01:21:48,452 --> 01:21:49,572
to be able to see the imperial envoy

1022
01:21:49,692 --> 01:21:51,572
to report your wrongdoings,

1023
01:21:51,692 --> 01:21:55,252
to prove my innocence;
don't force me to kill again

1024
01:21:55,372 --> 01:21:59,172
Don't be rash, stay away...

1025
01:21:59,812 --> 01:22:01,772
Make way... go

1026
01:22:01,852 --> 01:22:03,732
Go...

1027
01:22:11,972 --> 01:22:15,692
Go, what happened? Go

1028
01:22:23,733 --> 01:22:27,653
You are the god of justice

1029
01:22:27,773 --> 01:22:30,013
I kneel to you

1030
01:22:30,133 --> 01:22:32,613
and beg you to uphold justice

1031
01:22:45,453 --> 01:22:48,333
So long as you let me go,
I'll promise you anything

1032
01:22:50,493 --> 01:22:51,453
Let me tell you honestly

1033
01:22:51,573 --> 01:22:52,973
no matter what,
you won't be able to escape

1034
01:22:53,053 --> 01:22:54,533
Stop shouting or I'll kill you

1035
01:22:59,653 --> 01:23:00,733
Split up

1036
01:23:01,494 --> 01:23:02,654
Force him out

1037
01:23:02,774 --> 01:23:03,454
Yes

1038
01:23:04,894 --> 01:23:05,894
What about me?

1039
01:23:06,014 --> 01:23:07,334
You are unreliable

1040
01:23:07,414 --> 01:23:08,614
Stay here

1041
01:24:09,735 --> 01:24:10,695
Attack

1042
01:24:17,295 --> 01:24:18,135
Go away

1043
01:24:18,815 --> 01:24:21,175
Go away,
don't make me kill again, go away...

1044
01:24:21,295 --> 01:24:22,735
Go away...

1045
01:24:28,936 --> 01:24:30,296
The envoy is here

1046
01:24:32,216 --> 01:24:32,936
Stay on the line to welcome him

1047
01:24:33,016 --> 01:24:33,896
Yes

1048
01:24:58,936 --> 01:25:01,176
What's going on in here?

1049
01:25:01,936 --> 01:25:04,416
Sir, He Zhong Heng
escaped from prison last night

1050
01:25:04,536 --> 01:25:06,896
and is holding the magistrate as hostage

1051
01:25:07,296 --> 01:25:08,696
Don't listen to him

1052
01:25:08,816 --> 01:25:09,816
Ready

1053
01:25:10,216 --> 01:25:11,336
Stop

1054
01:25:12,136 --> 01:25:14,577
No one is going to proceed further

1055
01:25:14,657 --> 01:25:16,137
until the matter is cleared

1056
01:25:16,257 --> 01:25:18,457
or no one lives

1057
01:25:20,057 --> 01:25:21,737
This man is ferocious

1058
01:25:21,817 --> 01:25:23,177
You'd better go back to the office

1059
01:25:23,297 --> 01:25:24,337
and let me handle the case

1060
01:25:24,417 --> 01:25:24,857
Damn it

1061
01:25:24,977 --> 01:25:25,537
Yes

1062
01:25:25,617 --> 01:25:27,897
Injustice should be
thoroughly investigated

1063
01:25:28,017 --> 01:25:30,137
to prevent the innocent
from being wrongly executed

1064
01:25:31,017 --> 01:25:34,377
He, why did you hold
a government official hostage?

1065
01:25:34,497 --> 01:25:36,817
Do you know that
this is a crime that warrants death?

1066
01:25:36,937 --> 01:25:38,577
He doesn't deserve to be
our government official

1067
01:25:38,697 --> 01:25:40,737
The one I am holding right now
is a criminal

1068
01:25:40,857 --> 01:25:42,497
who protects prostitution,
gambling, and corruption

1069
01:25:42,617 --> 01:25:43,857
He's talking nonsense

1070
01:25:43,977 --> 01:25:45,457
Shut up

1071
01:25:45,577 --> 01:25:49,297
Tell me how you've been wronged
and I'll be the judge

1072
01:25:49,417 --> 01:25:51,377
I was originally a constable
in this province

1073
01:25:51,457 --> 01:25:53,297
Since I was against
the crime of this magistrate

1074
01:25:53,417 --> 01:25:57,018
he set me up and
put me in prison and killed my wife

1075
01:25:57,138 --> 01:25:58,618
It doesn't matter if I have to die, but

1076
01:25:58,698 --> 01:26:01,778
I do hope that you uphold justice
and prove me innocent

1077
01:26:01,898 --> 01:26:04,178
Your Honour, he's making
scurrilous attacks upon others

1078
01:26:04,298 --> 01:26:08,538
I have always been honest
and abide by the law

1079
01:26:08,618 --> 01:26:12,018
Nonsense. Haven't you sent Chief Liu

1080
01:26:12,138 --> 01:26:14,098
to come and offer me bribes?

1081
01:26:14,218 --> 01:26:14,978
Your Honour, I...

1082
01:26:15,098 --> 01:26:18,058
Shut up. When I was canvassing the people

1083
01:26:18,178 --> 01:26:20,658
I have already heard that you're corrupt

1084
01:26:20,778 --> 01:26:22,858
putting lives of the innocent in danger

1085
01:26:22,978 --> 01:26:25,538
Here's the witness, don't you dare deny

1086
01:26:25,618 --> 01:26:26,138
Bring the sword

1087
01:26:26,218 --> 01:26:27,058
Yes

1088
01:26:27,178 --> 01:26:30,778
Spare me, Your Honour;
I know I've been wrong, spare me

1089
01:26:32,178 --> 01:26:35,138
You've been corrupt,
your wrongs cannot be forgiven

1090
01:26:36,938 --> 01:26:43,179
Be lenient, Your Honour.
Please spare my life

1091
01:27:06,619 --> 01:27:08,139
Lord Ge, you have been badly terrified

1092
01:27:08,259 --> 01:27:10,579
If I hadn't done this,
saving you was almost impossible

1093
01:27:10,659 --> 01:27:12,819
Lord Huang, those gifts...

1094
01:27:12,939 --> 01:27:15,939
They've all been received,
no need for such great gifts

1095
01:27:16,059 --> 01:27:18,939
No problem

1096
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:35,460
Come on, men

1097
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:38,780
Archers, shoot

1098
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:47,540
Attack
