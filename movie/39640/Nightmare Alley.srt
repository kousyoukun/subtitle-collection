1
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,591
<i>Step right this way, folks.!
The show is about to begin.!</i>

2
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:02,292
<i>Right this way.! Here we are.!</i>

3
00:02:07,566 --> 00:02:11,623
Folks, I must ask you to remember
that this exhibit is being presented...

4
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:14,130
solely in the interest
of education and science.

5
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:17,892
Now, this creature... There he is! The geek!

6
00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:22,056
<i>He has puzzled the foremost
scientists of Europe and America.</i>

7
00:02:22,131 --> 00:02:25,586
<i>Is he the missing link? Is he man or beast?</i>

8
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,028
<i>Some have pronounced him man.</i>

9
00:02:28,097 --> 00:02:31,824
But beneath that shaggy mane of
hair, lies the brain of a beast.

10
00:02:31,897 --> 00:02:34,260
<i>Look.!</i>

11
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:39,160
<i>If he should sink his teeth into my arm,
nothing on this round, green earth could save me.</i>

12
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,593
Now, folks, it's feeding time.

13
00:02:45,296 --> 00:02:47,455
<i>Horrible.!</i>

14
00:02:52,762 --> 00:02:55,387
He's on fire!

15
00:02:55,461 --> 00:02:59,552
Now, folks, you haven't seen
anything yet. Step in closer, please.

16
00:02:59,627 --> 00:03:03,923
The greatest demonstration of fire
manipulation the world has ever seen!

17
00:03:03,993 --> 00:03:06,391
Hey. Come here.

18
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,762
Kind of a surprise to see you
hanging around that act, young man.

19
00:03:08,863 --> 00:03:09,914
Why?

20
00:03:09,993 --> 00:03:13,050
Hasn't got a skirt in it.

21
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:16,183
- Geek guy fascinates me.
- You aren't the only one.

22
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:19,282
That's why we got him in the show.

23
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:22,483
How do you get to be a
geek? Is that the only one?

24
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:25,423
- I mean, is a guy born that way?
- Let me tell you something, kid.

25
00:03:25,492 --> 00:03:29,254
When you've been around this carny longer,
you'll learn to quit asking questions.

26
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:35,279
- Come on, Pete.
- He gonna be able to work?

27
00:03:35,357 --> 00:03:38,585
Pete's okay. I've got him sobered up.

28
00:03:53,622 --> 00:03:56,747
- What's the matter, Stan?
- Nothing.

29
00:04:00,122 --> 00:04:03,179
What's the boss been razzing you about?

30
00:04:03,254 --> 00:04:06,687
I was just asking him about that
guy that does the geek business.

31
00:04:06,755 --> 00:04:09,777
- That's always a sore point in a carnival.
- Why?

32
00:04:09,854 --> 00:04:12,082
The geek is one of our biggest draws...

33
00:04:12,154 --> 00:04:15,210
but a lot of performers won't
work a show that carries one.

34
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:18,344
I can't understand how
anybody could get so low.

35
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,715
It can happen.

36
00:04:20,786 --> 00:04:23,116
- I wanna thank you, Zeena.
- Me?

37
00:04:23,187 --> 00:04:25,448
- Uh-huh.
- What for?

38
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,212
For being so nice to me, helping
me with my spiel and everything.

39
00:04:29,286 --> 00:04:32,343
- Well, I think you've got something, Stan.
- Honest?

40
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:36,510
- You like this racket, don't you?
- Oh, lady, I was made for it.

41
00:04:36,585 --> 00:04:40,176
I had all kinds of jobs
before this one came along...

42
00:04:40,251 --> 00:04:42,876
but none of'em were anything but jobs.

43
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:46,008
But this gets me. I like it. All of it.

44
00:04:46,084 --> 00:04:49,607
The crowds, the noise, the
idea of keeping on the move.

45
00:04:49,684 --> 00:04:53,775
You see those yokels out there, it
gives you sort of a superior feeling...

46
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,543
as if you were in the know and
they were on the outside looking in.

47
00:04:57,616 --> 00:05:00,740
Kinda hard to explain, but I like it.

48
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:05,505
I like you too, Zeena.

49
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:17,272
Hey, look! Hey, look! Hey,
look! Step right this way!

50
00:05:17,347 --> 00:05:21,006
Move in closer, ladies and gentlemen,
and let me introduce Zeena...

51
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,410
the miracle woman of the ages.

52
00:05:23,481 --> 00:05:27,435
She sees, she knows, she tells you all
the innermost secrets of your past...

53
00:05:27,513 --> 00:05:29,741
your present and your future.

54
00:05:29,814 --> 00:05:33,075
- Mademoiselle Zeena!
- Step right up, folks, and don't be bashful.

55
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:36,203
If any of you wants to ask
me a personal question...

56
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:39,768
Mr. Stanton will now pass among
you with little cards and envelopes.

57
00:05:39,846 --> 00:05:42,902
- Lend me your hand there.
- Write your question on the card!

58
00:05:42,978 --> 00:05:46,432
- I need a pencil.
- Pass those out. There we are, ladies.

59
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:49,999
Don't crowd. There's
plenty here for everyone.

60
00:05:50,077 --> 00:05:53,100
Careful not to let anyone else see what
you write, because that's your business.

61
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:56,472
I don't want anybody asking me
about anyone else's business.

62
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:58,269
One for you, young lady.

63
00:05:58,343 --> 00:06:01,707
When you have written your questions,
sign your initials or write your name...

64
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:04,072
as a token of good faith.

65
00:06:04,143 --> 00:06:07,802
Write what's in your heart, and when
you write about it, think about it.

66
00:06:07,876 --> 00:06:11,932
Madam? Yes, madam. Your questions
will be held in strictest confidence.

67
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:15,497
No one will know but yourself
and Mademoiselle Zeena.

68
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:19,234
Ah, I see that Mr. Stanton has
a good handful of questions.

69
00:06:19,308 --> 00:06:24,172
So if he'll bring 'em right up on
the stage, we'll have some readings.

70
00:06:24,241 --> 00:06:26,502
Thank you, sir.

71
00:06:26,574 --> 00:06:29,006
<i>Wait a minute. Here's mine.</i>

72
00:06:29,074 --> 00:06:33,028
<i>- Mister, here's my question!
- I'd like to ask you about my mother.</i>

73
00:06:33,107 --> 00:06:35,732
<i>Will that lady raise her hand, please?</i>

74
00:06:35,807 --> 00:06:36,949
<i>Come on, Pete. Here.</i>

75
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,534
<i>Madam, your mother's had a
lot of hard work in her life.</i>

76
00:06:39,606 --> 00:06:41,834
Come on. Take these. Here.

77
00:06:41,907 --> 00:06:44,838
- Another drink, huh?
- Hurry up. Show's on.

78
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:49,100
There's something in there I
don't see quite clearly yet.

79
00:06:49,173 --> 00:06:53,195
If you'll see me after this
demonstration, maybe I can tell you more.

80
00:06:53,272 --> 00:06:57,170
I'll ask Mr. Stanton to drop
the questions into the bowl.

81
00:06:57,238 --> 00:07:00,260
There they go. I don't touch them.

82
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:04,099
Now, people have asked me if I
have spirit aid in doing what I do.

83
00:07:04,171 --> 00:07:07,659
I always tell them the only spirits
I control are the ones in this bottle.

84
00:07:07,737 --> 00:07:10,567
<i>Spirits of alcohol!</i>

85
00:07:10,637 --> 00:07:13,194
I'll pour a little on the questions...

86
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,667
and ask Mr. Stanton to light a
match and drop it in the bowl.

87
00:07:18,936 --> 00:07:24,459
Thank you, Mr. Stanton. Now you see them
burning, and that's the last of them.

88
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:27,558
<i>Anybody who's afraid that somebody
else is going to read it...</i>

89
00:07:27,635 --> 00:07:29,863
<i>or that I would handle this question...</i>

90
00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:32,366
<i>can just forget that I ever touched them.</i>

91
00:07:32,434 --> 00:07:35,888
<i>Your question is now recorded
nowhere except in the ether.</i>

92
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:39,297
<i>Your answer is there too,
and I will find it for you.</i>

93
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:43,529
I get an impression.

94
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,722
It's a little cloudy, still,
but it's getting clearer.

95
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,561
I get the initials "J.E.G."

96
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:59,326
<i>I believe it's a gentleman. Is that right?</i>

97
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:02,413
Will the person who has
those initials raise his hand!

98
00:08:02,514 --> 00:08:03,922
Right here, missy!

99
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:06,726
<i>Thank you, Mr., uh... Giles.</i>

100
00:08:06,798 --> 00:08:08,264
<i>The name is Giles, isn't it?</i>

101
00:08:08,265 --> 00:08:11,197
<i>Yes, ma'am, that's his
name. That's his name. Giles.</i>

102
00:08:11,265 --> 00:08:14,355
<i>Giles, yes.</i>

103
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,658
<i>Molly.!</i>

104
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:21,594
<i>Wait. I see green trees and a rolling field.</i>

105
00:08:21,663 --> 00:08:23,595
<i>It's plowed land, fenced in.</i>

106
00:08:23,663 --> 00:08:27,425
<i>- That's your place.!
- Yes, ma'am, that's my place.</i>

107
00:08:27,496 --> 00:08:29,462
Oh, is that for me?

108
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:33,053
<i>- It's a wagon.
- Goodness.! That's what you asked about.!</i>

109
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:36,390
<i>- Zeena's going good.
- That's what I wrote.!</i>

110
00:08:36,462 --> 00:08:39,723
- She sure knows how to put on an act.
- Sure does.

111
00:08:39,795 --> 00:08:43,023
- Too bad she's tied up
with that rum-dum. - Why?

112
00:08:43,095 --> 00:08:46,151
She could grab herself a smart guy
and make the big time in no time.

113
00:08:46,227 --> 00:08:48,420
But she's already been in the big time.

114
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,550
She and Pete used to be one of the
biggest headliners in vaudeville.

115
00:08:51,627 --> 00:08:52,993
Not with that act.

116
00:08:53,094 --> 00:08:56,025
Pete stayed in the audience.
He never came near the stage.

117
00:08:56,093 --> 00:08:59,059
How could he tip her off to anything?

118
00:08:59,126 --> 00:09:02,115
They used a code, silly.

119
00:09:03,993 --> 00:09:07,322
A code? What kind of a code?

120
00:09:07,392 --> 00:09:10,586
A word code between the two of them.

121
00:09:10,658 --> 00:09:14,182
Zeena says that blindfold code
is worth its weight in gold.

122
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:16,486
I'll bet.

123
00:09:16,558 --> 00:09:20,217
- People still offer them big money for it.
- Why don't they sell it?

124
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,382
Zeena says it's their nest egg.

125
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:25,514
- Molly.
- Here comes your boyfriend.

126
00:09:27,891 --> 00:09:30,083
Hi, Bruno.

127
00:09:30,157 --> 00:09:33,214
- What's going on here?
- What does it look like?

128
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,687
- He get fresh, Molly?
- Sure I did.

129
00:09:35,756 --> 00:09:39,847
What do you think I'm made of? She's the
prettiest girl in the whole outfit, isn't she?

130
00:09:39,922 --> 00:09:41,254
Sure she is, but...

131
00:09:41,355 --> 00:09:44,218
Just because you're a big mush
is no sign everybody else is.

132
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:46,584
Come on, you lovely little freak.

133
00:09:46,655 --> 00:09:51,178
- Thanks for the pop, Stan.
- Next time I'll bring you a Kewpie doll.

134
00:09:51,255 --> 00:09:54,516
How do you like that? He had the
nerve to admit it right to my face.

135
00:09:54,587 --> 00:09:56,815
Look, Bruno. I'm no baby.

136
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,080
I can take care of myself.

137
00:09:59,154 --> 00:10:02,745
When I'm talking to somebody, I wish
you wouldn't come butting in like that.

138
00:10:28,951 --> 00:10:31,814
What are you thinking about, Stan?

139
00:10:31,884 --> 00:10:35,714
Molly was telling me about that code
you and Pete used to use in vaudeville.

140
00:10:35,784 --> 00:10:38,215
What about it?

141
00:10:38,283 --> 00:10:41,840
Well, I was thinking that if
Pete got sick or something...

142
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:45,541
why, I could work from the
audience just like he used to.

143
00:10:45,616 --> 00:10:48,548
No stage trap, no gypsy switch.

144
00:10:48,616 --> 00:10:53,241
- How do you mean?
- You know, if you taught me the code.

145
00:10:53,315 --> 00:10:56,372
Over my dead body she will.

146
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,880
You got a nerve, young fella.

147
00:10:58,948 --> 00:11:03,902
- Do you know what a code like that is worth?
- Okay, okay, forget it.

148
00:11:03,981 --> 00:11:08,606
- I was just trying to help you folks.
- I heard you the first time.

149
00:11:36,044 --> 00:11:39,635
We gotta... We gotta watch
ourselves on account of...

150
00:11:40,878 --> 00:11:43,866
- Sure.
- Hurt him enough already.

151
00:11:43,943 --> 00:11:47,000
I thought it was the other way around.

152
00:11:47,077 --> 00:11:51,168
No, Pete was all right
till they picked me up.

153
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:54,471
- What happened?
- Exactly what's happening now.

154
00:11:54,543 --> 00:11:58,373
I'm about as reliable
as a two-dollar cornet.

155
00:11:58,442 --> 00:12:01,499
You're crazy. You've got a heart as big...

156
00:12:01,575 --> 00:12:05,564
Sure. As big as an artichoke.
A leaf for everyone.

157
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:09,199
That's what Pete said when
he began hittin' the bottle.

158
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:12,331
Then one day he didn't show up.

159
00:12:12,407 --> 00:12:16,499
I dug up another partner, a
magician by the name of Benston.

160
00:12:16,574 --> 00:12:18,869
I was no good without Pete.

161
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,702
In a couple of seasons I was glad to
get a job with an outfit like this.

162
00:12:24,206 --> 00:12:27,831
Pete showed up about a year ago.

163
00:12:27,906 --> 00:12:30,202
Here we are.

164
00:12:30,273 --> 00:12:34,136
I did everything I could to make
it up to him, but you see how it is.

165
00:12:34,205 --> 00:12:37,967
The more I try, the worse he gets.

166
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:41,061
And I'm not gonna give up on him.

167
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:44,298
It's the least I can do.

168
00:12:44,371 --> 00:12:46,996
Zeena, you're a real woman.

169
00:13:02,536 --> 00:13:05,024
Look at him.

170
00:13:05,102 --> 00:13:08,500
He's like a dog waiting for
somebody to throw him a bone.

171
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:15,529
Come on. Help me get some breakfast into him.

172
00:13:15,602 --> 00:13:18,466
- Hi, Pete!
- Hello, baby. How'd you make out?

173
00:13:18,535 --> 00:13:21,557
We don't have to sleep in the truck tonight.

174
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:25,726
I got me the bridal suite at
the hotel. Two rooms and bath.

175
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:28,232
- Where's Molly?
- I left her at the hotel.

176
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,460
Come on, you two. Looks like you
could use a good, hot bath yourselves.

177
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:34,632
I'll be all right. You and Pete go ahead.

178
00:13:34,798 --> 00:13:36,821
Don't be silly. Huh, Pete?

179
00:13:36,898 --> 00:13:40,295
It's all right. I've
gotta see a fella anyhow.

180
00:13:40,365 --> 00:13:44,888
What's your rush? You're dead on your feet.

181
00:13:44,964 --> 00:13:49,293
Well, this fella's got something
that'll take care of that.

182
00:13:49,364 --> 00:13:51,659
Here's enough for a shot.

183
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,287
But remember, only one.

184
00:13:54,363 --> 00:13:56,556
Swell. See ya later.

185
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,027
Stan.

186
00:13:59,096 --> 00:14:01,528
Wait a minute, Pete.

187
00:14:01,595 --> 00:14:03,857
Get some coffee in you first.

188
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:07,383
Promise Zeena you'll get something to eat.

189
00:14:07,462 --> 00:14:11,951
I shall probably have a small orange
juice, two three-minute eggs...

190
00:14:12,028 --> 00:14:15,391
some melba toast and coffee.

191
00:14:17,794 --> 00:14:20,918
Got to see my money's safe.

192
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:32,518
Pete just gave you a gander
at himself, before and after.

193
00:14:32,592 --> 00:14:37,718
- I've seen worse.
- You think it's too late to put him in a cure?

194
00:14:37,792 --> 00:14:41,883
I don't know much about those things,
but I understand it takes dough.

195
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,288
- I can get it.
- How?

196
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:47,620
Sell that code.

197
00:14:47,691 --> 00:14:50,714
- The code?
- Uh-huh.

198
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:54,348
- I got a better idea.
- What's that?

199
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:59,185
Let's build up a new act with it.

200
00:14:59,256 --> 00:15:02,279
What good'll that do? I'm
gettin' top carny dough right now.

201
00:15:02,357 --> 00:15:05,686
I wasn't talking about doing
it in this mouse menagerie.

202
00:15:05,756 --> 00:15:09,153
You and I? Where else would we do it?

203
00:15:09,222 --> 00:15:13,416
If Pete could make a headliner out of you, I
don't see why you couldn't do the same with me.

204
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:15,681
Oh, Stan.

205
00:15:15,755 --> 00:15:19,051
You think I can make the big time again?

206
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:23,546
You'd know more about that than I would.

207
00:15:25,954 --> 00:15:30,318
- How about it, baby?
- Don't rush me. Let me think about it.

208
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,415
Hey, where you goin'?

209
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:43,277
Come on, Stan! Give Bruno a hand!

210
00:16:03,084 --> 00:16:05,641
What are you doing?

211
00:16:05,717 --> 00:16:09,150
Cut them three times.

212
00:16:11,683 --> 00:16:15,342
- What kind of deck is this?
- This is a tarot.

213
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,847
Oldest kind of cards in the world.

214
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:21,507
Pete says the Gypsies
brought them out of Egypt.

215
00:16:21,582 --> 00:16:24,843
They're a wonder for giving private readings.

216
00:16:24,915 --> 00:16:27,143
Say, they look plenty weird.

217
00:16:27,215 --> 00:16:31,704
Whenever I have something to decide
or don't know which way to turn...

218
00:16:31,781 --> 00:16:34,303
Look, Stan. That's the wheel of fortune.

219
00:16:34,381 --> 00:16:37,438
- Yeah.
- That means we're gonna knock 'em dead.

220
00:16:37,514 --> 00:16:40,843
- Pete and I never had it this good.
- What did I tell you?

221
00:16:42,847 --> 00:16:46,301
- What's the matter?
- Well, I don't know.

222
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,971
Everything looks wonderful for us...

223
00:16:49,046 --> 00:16:51,807
money, happiness and great success.

224
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:54,106
But there's no sign of Pete in it.

225
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,441
How could he be if he's away taking the cure?

226
00:16:57,512 --> 00:17:00,481
But there's no sign of him
anywhere, dead or alive.

227
00:17:00,582 --> 00:17:01,967
Hang on.

228
00:17:02,045 --> 00:17:04,408
Yeah, maybe this is Pete.

229
00:17:05,911 --> 00:17:08,503
Did you knock this off the table?

230
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:12,441
- No. You must have dropped it yourself.
- I don't see how I could.

231
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,374
- Was it face up or down?
- Face down.

232
00:17:15,444 --> 00:17:19,001
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Why?

233
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:24,933
<i>- Couldn't be like that. It's
too awful, it's too crazy.</i>

234
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:28,203
<i>- What's got into you?
- Get your bath and get out ofhere.</i>

235
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:32,997
- What's the matter?
- It's all off, Stan.

236
00:17:33,076 --> 00:17:36,530
- The act?
- Everything.

237
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:40,097
- But what have I done?
- Nothing. But I can't go against the cards.

238
00:17:40,175 --> 00:17:43,198
- You don't believe in that junk?
- I didn't used to.

239
00:17:43,274 --> 00:17:47,366
But time after time it told me I was gonna
ruin Pete's life, and I went right ahead.

240
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,498
- Here's Pete's card.
- What are you worrying about?

241
00:17:50,573 --> 00:17:54,630
- Is this the one that was on the floor?
- No, this one.

242
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:59,230
You see what it means? Are you satisfied?

243
00:17:59,306 --> 00:18:01,703
Zeena, it just doesn't make sense.

244
00:18:01,772 --> 00:18:05,260
Maybe not. Maybe it's silly, maybe it isn't.

245
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:08,998
Listen, honey. We've all gotta die sometime.

246
00:18:09,072 --> 00:18:11,503
But when a card falls on the floor...

247
00:18:11,571 --> 00:18:14,197
whatever happens, good or
bad, is gonna happen fast.

248
00:18:14,271 --> 00:18:17,328
And when a card falls face down, it's bad.

249
00:18:17,404 --> 00:18:21,302
- That's for the chumps.
- Been true of Pete and me so far, hasn't it?

250
00:18:21,371 --> 00:18:26,200
Honest, Zeena, to see a smart girl like you
fall for one of your own boob-catchers...

251
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,259
I give up. Yes, sir, I give up.

252
00:18:29,337 --> 00:18:32,098
<i>- I don't believe it.
- Huh?</i>

253
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,431
You never give up.

254
00:18:36,869 --> 00:18:39,357
Me? Why do you say that?

255
00:18:39,436 --> 00:18:42,595
Well, I don't know. I just have the feeling.

256
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:46,623
That's why I'm gonna keep away from you.

257
00:18:46,702 --> 00:18:49,691
- You know...
- What?

258
00:18:49,768 --> 00:18:52,824
- I wonder why I'm like that.
- Like what?

259
00:18:52,901 --> 00:18:56,697
I'm never thinking about
anybody except myself.

260
00:18:56,767 --> 00:19:00,290
Did your folks drop you
on your head or something?

261
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:02,628
Yeah, they dropped me, all right.

262
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,325
Listen, honey. I don't want to
make you unhappy. You know that.

263
00:19:07,399 --> 00:19:10,956
If you want to forget about the
whole thing, it's all right with me.

264
00:19:11,032 --> 00:19:14,759
- You won't get sore, Stan?
- What do you think I am?

265
00:19:18,565 --> 00:19:21,690
Let me alone for a minute. I've got to think.

266
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:34,987
<i>You're terrible.</i>

267
00:19:35,064 --> 00:19:38,723
- Is that Pete?
- No, it's somebody else. Get in there, quick.

268
00:19:45,363 --> 00:19:48,590
- Hello, Bruno. Come on in.
- Hello, Zeena. How's everything?

269
00:19:48,662 --> 00:19:52,116
- Where's Molly?
- She's in there pounding her pretty little ear.

270
00:19:52,195 --> 00:19:54,525
- In here?
- Yeah.

271
00:19:58,928 --> 00:20:01,155
Hey. Whose cap is that?

272
00:20:01,227 --> 00:20:04,681
- That's Stan's. He's in there taking a bath.
- Taking a what?

273
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,847
Bet you could use one, huh?

274
00:20:05,948 --> 00:20:08,022
Sure, but I wouldn't want to
put you through all that...

275
00:20:08,094 --> 00:20:12,685
What do you think I got the place for?
Bunking in that truck gets you down. Stan!

276
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,191
<i>- Yeah?
- Hurry up. We got another customer.</i>

277
00:20:50,723 --> 00:20:52,780
<i>- Hey. Charlie?
- What?</i>

278
00:20:52,856 --> 00:20:55,151
Got a quart you can spare?

279
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:01,351
- Stan, when did you start nibblin'?
- I get around.

280
00:21:03,355 --> 00:21:07,014
- That'll be four bucks.
- It'll have to wait until payday.

281
00:21:07,088 --> 00:21:09,349
Moonshine.

282
00:21:09,421 --> 00:21:12,751
- Don't forget. It's four bucks.
- It's a debt of honor.

283
00:21:19,087 --> 00:21:21,484
<i>Charlie.</i>

284
00:21:21,553 --> 00:21:24,644
<i>Pete. How you doin'?</i>

285
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,776
Bad. Won't you trust me? Just a half pint.

286
00:21:27,852 --> 00:21:31,511
I'm sorry, Pete. You know I
promised Zeena. Now go away.

287
00:21:31,586 --> 00:21:34,814
- Yeah, but I... Charlie!
- Please go away.

288
00:21:48,017 --> 00:21:50,176
Well, you're a fine one.

289
00:21:50,251 --> 00:21:53,307
Running off in the middle
of the show. Zeena was sore.

290
00:21:53,383 --> 00:21:58,077
I couldn't help it. She's got me on a diet.

291
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,445
One shot a day.

292
00:22:00,516 --> 00:22:03,573
- You seem to be doing all right.
- No.

293
00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:06,012
Just a sip here and there.

294
00:22:06,082 --> 00:22:09,071
Zeena's tipped everybody off.

295
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:15,946
I seem to have the dropsies tonight.

296
00:22:16,014 --> 00:22:18,276
Yeah, I heard you the first time.

297
00:22:18,348 --> 00:22:22,609
Look. I'd like to help you, but I
don't wanna get in Dutch with Zeena.

298
00:22:22,681 --> 00:22:25,340
You won't. You know me, Stan.

299
00:22:25,414 --> 00:22:28,471
I
- I wouldn't tell anybody. Never.

300
00:22:37,413 --> 00:22:40,742
<i>I'll get him.</i>

301
00:22:47,078 --> 00:22:49,636
<i>I'll take care ofhim.!</i>

302
00:22:49,711 --> 00:22:52,973
It's the geek. He's got
the heebie-jeebies again.

303
00:22:53,045 --> 00:22:56,101
Yeah. Hoatley didn't
give him his bottle today.

304
00:22:56,177 --> 00:22:59,507
- Why?
- Says he's been laying down on the job.

305
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:03,066
Ah, that's silly. Guy's been ready
for the straitjacket for a week.

306
00:23:03,144 --> 00:23:08,166
It's not right to cut a man
off so quick, right in midair.

307
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,969
Come on. Steady.

308
00:23:17,042 --> 00:23:19,474
Boy, have I got 'em.

309
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:22,167
Here.

310
00:23:22,242 --> 00:23:25,366
You need that worse than I do.

311
00:23:34,074 --> 00:23:36,767
How is it?

312
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,305
Awful.

313
00:23:39,373 --> 00:23:43,566
But I wish I had a barrel of it.

314
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:47,731
You're a good kid, Stan.
You're going to go places.

315
00:23:47,806 --> 00:23:52,794
<i>Nothing can keep you out of the
big time. You've got everything.</i>

316
00:23:52,872 --> 00:23:55,565
Just like I used to have.

317
00:23:55,638 --> 00:23:58,103
Me and Zeena.

318
00:23:58,171 --> 00:24:01,228
You should have seen us pack 'em in.

319
00:24:01,305 --> 00:24:05,498
They'd wait through six acts just to see us.

320
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:09,128
Top billing everywhere we went.

321
00:24:09,203 --> 00:24:13,601
<i>I was born brought up in Boston</i>

322
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:17,898
<i>A city we all know well</i>

323
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:22,061
Brought up by heartless parents

324
00:24:22,136 --> 00:24:26,966
The truth to you I'll tell

325
00:24:27,036 --> 00:24:31,730
<i>Brought up by heartless parents</i>

326
00:24:31,802 --> 00:24:34,427
<i>Poor guy.</i>

327
00:24:34,502 --> 00:24:39,126
"Poor guy". If it weren't for Zeena,
they'd be saying that about me.

328
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,394
Poor Pete. Pete the geek.

329
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:44,659
Ah, you're crazy.

330
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,995
<i>No. I remember that fella
when he first showed up here.</i>

331
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:52,089
<i>Hoatley knew him in the old days. So did I.</i>

332
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:54,688
Course, we pretended we didn't.

333
00:24:54,766 --> 00:24:59,096
<i>- Who was he? - Hmm? He
used to be plenty big-time.</i>

334
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:02,256
- Mental act?
- What difference does it make?

335
00:25:02,332 --> 00:25:04,560
It's all smoked meat now.

336
00:25:04,632 --> 00:25:08,257
Just a bottle-a-day rum-dum, and
he thinks this job is heaven...

337
00:25:08,331 --> 00:25:13,525
long as he has his bottle a day
and a dry place to sleep it off in.

338
00:25:15,464 --> 00:25:19,793
There's only one thing this
stuff'll make you forget.

339
00:25:19,864 --> 00:25:22,796
<i>- What's that?
- How to forget.</i>

340
00:25:22,864 --> 00:25:25,091
- Have a drink.
- No, thanks.

341
00:25:27,996 --> 00:25:31,053
I, uh... wonder where Zeena is.

342
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:34,152
Waiting for me at the hotel, I suppose.

343
00:25:34,229 --> 00:25:36,660
She's always waiting for me.

344
00:25:38,895 --> 00:25:42,452
Boy, you should have seen us work once.

345
00:25:42,528 --> 00:25:46,290
I heard you were pretty good by yourself.

346
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:09,117
Chord from the orchestra,
amber spot, and I'm on.

347
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:13,283
Make my spiel. Good for one
laugh. Plenty of mystery.

348
00:26:13,358 --> 00:26:16,654
Just a minute there.

349
00:26:16,724 --> 00:26:19,781
Go right into my reading.

350
00:26:19,858 --> 00:26:21,949
Here's my crystal.

351
00:26:26,024 --> 00:26:29,581
Throughout the ages man has
sought to look behind the veil...

352
00:26:29,657 --> 00:26:32,646
that hides him from tomorrow...

353
00:26:32,723 --> 00:26:37,587
and through the ages certain men have
looked into the polished crystal...

354
00:26:37,657 --> 00:26:39,884
and seen.

355
00:26:39,956 --> 00:26:42,979
Is it some quality of the crystal itself...

356
00:26:43,056 --> 00:26:47,147
or does the gazer merely use
it to turn his gaze inward?

357
00:26:47,222 --> 00:26:50,052
Who knows? But visions come.

358
00:26:50,122 --> 00:26:54,247
Slowly shifting their form, visions come.

359
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:59,651
Wait! The shifting shapes begin to clear.

360
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:04,880
I see fields of grass and rolling hills...

361
00:27:04,954 --> 00:27:07,388
and a boy.

362
00:27:07,521 --> 00:27:12,475
A boy is running barefoot through the hills.

363
00:27:12,553 --> 00:27:15,076
A dog is with him.

364
00:27:16,387 --> 00:27:19,944
A dog is with him.

365
00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:23,416
Yes. His name was Gyp.

366
00:27:23,486 --> 00:27:25,748
Go on.

367
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:30,410
See how easy it is to hook 'em?

368
00:27:31,852 --> 00:27:35,682
Stock reading. Fits everybody.

369
00:27:35,752 --> 00:27:39,445
What's youth? Happy one
minute, heartbroken the next.

370
00:27:39,518 --> 00:27:42,950
Every boy has a dog.

371
00:27:47,016 --> 00:27:50,073
Now, now, now. Steady.

372
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:53,980
I'm just an old drunk. Just an old lush.

373
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:58,573
Zeena will be mad. Good old Zeena.

374
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:02,137
- Well, gotta go now. Zeena will be waiting.
- Okay, give me the bottle.

375
00:28:02,216 --> 00:28:04,875
- Why?
- She'll only take it away from you.

376
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:07,107
Oh, I'll finish it first.

377
00:28:07,181 --> 00:28:10,772
<i>- Zeena will be worried.
- Oh, Zeena's always worried about little Pete.</i>

378
00:28:10,848 --> 00:28:14,303
Hangs over me like I was an ice-cream soda.

379
00:28:14,381 --> 00:28:16,438
<i>Ah, let her worry.</i>

380
00:28:16,514 --> 00:28:19,810
<i>- What are you gonna do now?
- Take a little snooze.</i>

381
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,369
<i>Drink a little drink. Dream and drink.</i>

382
00:28:23,447 --> 00:28:25,935
<i>Drink and dream.</i>

383
00:28:38,145 --> 00:28:40,111
- Charlie.
- Hi, Molly.

384
00:28:40,178 --> 00:28:42,973
- Where's Stan?
- Stan? He's out there.

385
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:49,300
Stan! Stan. Where's Zeena?

386
00:28:49,378 --> 00:28:52,640
I think she's over picking
up her dough. What's up?

387
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:55,142
It's Pete. We can't wake him.

388
00:28:55,211 --> 00:29:00,370
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know. Everybody's scared stiff.

389
00:29:00,443 --> 00:29:02,874
Well, come on!

390
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:21,273
- Take it easy.
- Let him alone. I'll take care of him.

391
00:29:21,341 --> 00:29:24,102
Come on, Pete. Pete!

392
00:29:24,174 --> 00:29:26,469
<i>Come on, Pete. Pete, answer me.!</i>

393
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,029
<i>Pete, do you hear me? Pete.</i>

394
00:29:29,108 --> 00:29:32,699
<i>Come on, Pete. Do you hear me? Pete.!</i>

395
00:29:32,774 --> 00:29:36,569
- Call a doctor!
- I'm afraid it's too late, kid. Smell that.

396
00:29:39,206 --> 00:29:41,365
Pete didn't drink this.

397
00:29:41,439 --> 00:29:44,166
This is the wood alcohol I
use for burning my envelopes.

398
00:29:44,267 --> 00:29:45,531
Where do you keep it?

399
00:29:45,605 --> 00:29:47,594
In my prop trunk.

400
00:29:47,672 --> 00:29:50,729
Oh, Pete. Pete, what
happened? Pete! Oh, Pete!

401
00:29:50,805 --> 00:29:54,100
- It's all right.
- Oh, Pete!

402
00:29:54,171 --> 00:29:56,467
Pete!

403
00:31:00,199 --> 00:31:02,426
He's gone.

404
00:31:02,498 --> 00:31:05,952
He was a good guy and a swell trouper.

405
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:09,758
Only last night I made up
my mind to put him in a cure.

406
00:31:09,831 --> 00:31:13,354
Only last night!

407
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:47,251
- What have I here?
- A gold earring.

408
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:55,024
- Can you tell me what this is?
- It's a key case.

409
00:31:55,094 --> 00:31:57,753
<i>- What color?
- It is red.</i>

410
00:31:57,827 --> 00:32:01,849
<i>Ah, here we are.!</i>

411
00:32:01,926 --> 00:32:06,551
Now, Madame Zeena, will you name this?

412
00:32:07,991 --> 00:32:11,048
- It's a scarf.
- Right again!

413
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:15,557
<i>Here.! Quick now. What is this?</i>

414
00:32:15,624 --> 00:32:19,283
- Can't take your eyes off him?
- I want to be sure he's getting it right.

415
00:32:19,358 --> 00:32:21,687
- Getting what right?
- The code.

416
00:32:21,757 --> 00:32:26,053
How do you suppose Zeena's working
without anybody in the cubbyhole?

417
00:32:27,757 --> 00:32:31,779
Please concentrate and see
if you know what this is.

418
00:32:31,856 --> 00:32:34,822
<i>A gold watch.</i>

419
00:32:34,889 --> 00:32:37,081
How does she do it?

420
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:40,212
She and Stan are using a two-person code.

421
00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:44,085
- What's that?
- Each word stands for a number.

422
00:32:44,155 --> 00:32:46,746
Each number stands for some object.

423
00:32:46,822 --> 00:32:49,049
But there's more to it than that.

424
00:32:49,121 --> 00:32:53,553
It's the way you accent the
syllables and the vowels. Listen.

425
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,212
Quick now. Will you name this?

426
00:32:56,287 --> 00:32:58,515
He's telling Zeena it's a lady's hat.

427
00:32:58,587 --> 00:33:00,779
<i>A lady's hat. A beautiful hat.</i>

428
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:03,046
How did you know that?

429
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,381
Zeena and I have been helping
Stan memorize the code.

430
00:33:06,453 --> 00:33:08,749
Zeena says he's already
got it as good as she has.

431
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,876
<i>- Here. Quick now. What is this?
- A silver dollar.</i>

432
00:33:14,052 --> 00:33:18,108
As soon as Stan has more practice,
they're going to quit the carnival.

433
00:33:18,185 --> 00:33:19,483
He and Zeena?

434
00:33:19,584 --> 00:33:22,379
Zeena's already written to
three or four booking agents.

435
00:33:22,452 --> 00:33:26,043
<i>This yours, miss?</i>

436
00:33:26,118 --> 00:33:29,208
Am-scray.
The ulls-bay.

437
00:33:31,484 --> 00:33:34,972
Police.

438
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:37,811
<i>That concludes our
performance for the time being.</i>

439
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:41,337
You all must be pretty dry
and could use a cold drink.

440
00:33:41,416 --> 00:33:44,904
I want to call your attention to
that stand across the midway...

441
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:47,709
where you can get all the
ice-cold soda pop you can drink.

442
00:33:47,782 --> 00:33:51,111
<i>- Stay right where you are. You too.
- That's all for now.</i>

443
00:33:51,182 --> 00:33:55,910
<i>Come back tomorrow and you'll see a
lot of things you didn't see tonight.</i>

444
00:33:55,981 --> 00:33:59,743
Hello, chief. My name is
Hoatley. I own this attraction.

445
00:33:59,815 --> 00:34:03,110
- You're the man I'm looking for.
- You're welcome to inspect the place.

446
00:34:03,181 --> 00:34:05,469
We've no girl shows, no
games of skill or chance.

447
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:06,613
That's right, chief.

448
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,873
- Quiet, both of you.
- You're the boss.

449
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:12,003
- What do you got in that geek place?
- Crocodile tamer. Wanna see?

450
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,376
That ain't what I heard.

451
00:34:14,447 --> 00:34:19,378
You got an illegal performance going on with
cruelty to human beings and live chickens.

452
00:34:19,446 --> 00:34:22,503
That's an exaggeration, chief. Stay
as my guest and view the entire...

453
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:27,068
Shut up, you. I've got orders from the mayor
to close you down and arrest who I see fit.

454
00:34:27,145 --> 00:34:30,736
Send somebody for that geek. I'm
taking him and you and that girl there.

455
00:34:30,812 --> 00:34:31,886
<i>What for?</i>

456
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,335
Indecent exposure. That's
what I'm arresting her for.

457
00:34:34,411 --> 00:34:35,698
She didn't do anything wrong.

458
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:38,275
We've decent women in this town,
daughters and growing girls.

459
00:34:38,345 --> 00:34:40,572
- Come on!
- Just a moment, Sheriff.

460
00:34:40,644 --> 00:34:44,508
- Molly. The chair.
- Get out of that contraption.

461
00:34:58,909 --> 00:35:03,841
Now you can see the reason for the
costume this young lady is forced to wear.

462
00:35:03,909 --> 00:35:06,703
The electricity would
ignite any ordinary fabric.

463
00:35:06,774 --> 00:35:10,399
Only by wearing the thinnest covering
can she avoid bursting into flames.

464
00:35:10,474 --> 00:35:14,406
That's right, chief. Thousands of volts
of current cover her body like a sheet.

465
00:35:14,474 --> 00:35:17,531
You can't pull the wool over
my eyes with a lot of sparks.

466
00:35:17,606 --> 00:35:21,164
I've done business with you carnival
crooks before. Get that geek in here.

467
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:24,137
You can talk to the judge.

468
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:28,900
- Go get that geek. Put a shirt on him first.
- Wait a minute.

469
00:35:28,972 --> 00:35:31,369
Let me take a crack at that hick.

470
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:34,894
- You daffy? You want him to pinch the whole show?
- Slip me a couple of bills.

471
00:35:34,971 --> 00:35:38,096
- You can't bribe these guys.
- Come on, come on. Give me the dough.

472
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:43,102
- It won't work.
- I'm not gonna bribe him.

473
00:35:43,171 --> 00:35:45,399
<i>That's what they say.</i>

474
00:35:45,471 --> 00:35:48,732
No, no, no. We're not
bothering any of the town folk.

475
00:35:48,804 --> 00:35:53,429
- Excuse me, Marshal.
- I don't want any more of your soft soap.

476
00:35:53,503 --> 00:35:57,595
Pardon me, sir, but there seems to be
several bills coming out of your pocket.

477
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:00,227
Another minute and you'd
have lost your money.

478
00:36:00,303 --> 00:36:04,394
And I see you've bought your wife a
present of a lovely silk handkerchief.

479
00:36:04,469 --> 00:36:07,866
That's very nice. I'm sure
she's gonna like that very much.

480
00:36:07,935 --> 00:36:12,300
- And a pure white one. For your daughter?
- How'd you know I got a daughter?

481
00:36:12,368 --> 00:36:15,391
I know many things, Marshal.

482
00:36:15,468 --> 00:36:19,900
I don't know how I know them, but there's
nothing supernatural about it, I'm sure.

483
00:36:19,967 --> 00:36:22,398
You see, my family was Scotch...

484
00:36:22,467 --> 00:36:26,695
and the Scotch are often gifted with powers
that the old folks used to call "second sight".

485
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,994
You don't say.

486
00:36:29,067 --> 00:36:32,499
For instance, I can see that you
have carried a pocket piece...

487
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:36,589
or a curio of some kind for nearly 20 years.

488
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:39,188
Several times you lost that luck piece...

489
00:36:39,266 --> 00:36:41,731
but you found it again every time.

490
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:45,697
It means a great deal to you,
and you don't know exactly why.

491
00:36:45,765 --> 00:36:49,992
- I would say that you should always carry that.
- I always do.

492
00:36:51,498 --> 00:36:53,929
Now, Marshal, this is none of my business.

493
00:36:53,998 --> 00:36:57,555
I see that you're a man who is fully
capable of handling his own affairs...

494
00:36:57,631 --> 00:37:00,188
and almost anything else
that's liable to come along.

495
00:37:00,264 --> 00:37:04,753
But my Scotch blood is
working right this minute...

496
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:09,762
and it tells me that there is one thing
in your life that's worrying you...

497
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:12,886
something that you find
very difficult to handle...

498
00:37:12,962 --> 00:37:16,985
because all your strength and your courage...

499
00:37:17,063 --> 00:37:21,119
and your authority in the
town seems to be of no avail.

500
00:37:21,195 --> 00:37:24,184
It seems to slip through
your grasp like water.

501
00:37:24,262 --> 00:37:28,353
Wait a minute, young fella.
Who you been talkin' to?

502
00:37:28,428 --> 00:37:31,485
As I say, it's none of my business.

503
00:37:31,561 --> 00:37:35,652
You are a man in the prime of
life, old enough to be my father.

504
00:37:35,727 --> 00:37:40,318
<i>By rights, you should be the one giving
me good advice, not the other way around.</i>

505
00:37:40,393 --> 00:37:42,586
Where's everybody? Joe, come on.

506
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:47,387
Tim, put those lights out. Get
that crowd out of here. Beat it.

507
00:37:47,459 --> 00:37:51,016
- Think he can pull it off?
- Look at him. I told you that kid had it.

508
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:58,547
I sense that there are antagonistic
influences surrounding you.

509
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:01,489
Come here.

510
00:38:01,558 --> 00:38:04,853
Someone near to you is jealous of you...

511
00:38:04,924 --> 00:38:07,152
and your ability.

512
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:12,987
Son, that's the gospel truth.

513
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:17,149
And while part of it extends to
your work as a peace officer...

514
00:38:17,223 --> 00:38:21,348
there is another part that has
to do with your spiritual life...

515
00:38:21,423 --> 00:38:25,048
and the influence of a good woman.

516
00:38:27,122 --> 00:38:32,110
Yes. Yes, there is someone
you love very dearly.

517
00:38:35,055 --> 00:38:38,316
But there is an obstacle
in the way of that love.

518
00:38:38,387 --> 00:38:42,376
I can't see what it is.
It's rather dim right now.

519
00:38:45,421 --> 00:38:48,477
You feel hemmed in and trapped by it.

520
00:38:48,553 --> 00:38:52,041
But through it all I hear a woman's voice.

521
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:56,142
A sweet voice singing a beautiful old hymn.

522
00:38:56,219 --> 00:38:58,616
"O Pilot Me".

523
00:39:00,786 --> 00:39:04,411
Or is it "Over the River"?

524
00:39:04,485 --> 00:39:08,212
She can sing both of them.

525
00:39:08,285 --> 00:39:12,341
I see a Sunday morning in a
beautiful, peaceful little church.

526
00:39:12,418 --> 00:39:15,872
You have labored hard in this
lovely vineyard, Marshal...

527
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:20,042
and your labor is rewarded
by a fine woman's love.

528
00:39:20,117 --> 00:39:22,344
But I hear malicious tongues out there.

529
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:26,179
I see jealous faces waiting to surround
you again and to do you an injury...

530
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:29,374
and to harm that splendid
woman too, if they can.

531
00:39:29,449 --> 00:39:32,381
You must be strong, Marshal.

532
00:39:32,449 --> 00:39:36,881
You have the strength within
you, an everlasting supply.

533
00:39:36,948 --> 00:39:40,176
But not to crush... to uplift.

534
00:39:40,249 --> 00:39:44,010
Repay evil with good. Love your neighbor.

535
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:46,309
Do not hate your enemies.

536
00:39:46,381 --> 00:39:50,870
Forgive them. They just
don't know what they're doing.

537
00:39:50,947 --> 00:39:54,003
Don't forget... to err is human...

538
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,604
to forgive... divine.

539
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,873
Good-bye now.

540
00:40:21,078 --> 00:40:24,134
Where is everybody?

541
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:27,733
<i>- Molly?
- I'll be out in a minute, Stan.</i>

542
00:40:32,076 --> 00:40:35,564
- It's okay, honey. I stalled him off.
- I heard you. You were great.

543
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:38,195
Ah, it was a lead pipe. I
could do it with anybody.

544
00:40:38,296 --> 00:40:39,472
Oh, sure you could.

545
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:42,371
- You're wonderful, Stan. Just wonderful.
- Honest?

546
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:47,533
- What are you shaking for?
- I don't know. I'm not scared anymore.

547
00:40:47,608 --> 00:40:51,062
- I don't know what it is, but I'll be all right.
- Sure.

548
00:40:51,141 --> 00:40:53,405
Nothing's gonna hurt you
as long as Stan's around.

549
00:40:53,506 --> 00:40:54,538
I know it.

550
00:40:54,607 --> 00:40:56,902
You're terrifi...

551
00:41:05,439 --> 00:41:07,904
Oh, Stan, we shouldn't do this.

552
00:41:07,972 --> 00:41:10,063
Why not?

553
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:21,532
No.

554
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,331
- You're worrying about Zeena.
- Somebody ought to.

555
00:41:24,404 --> 00:41:28,063
You're wrong, honey. Zeena and
I are just friends, that's all.

556
00:41:28,137 --> 00:41:31,194
- You don't have to lie.
- I'm not lying.

557
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:34,326
I've only been kidding her
along on account of the code.

558
00:41:34,403 --> 00:41:37,460
- Didn't look like kidding to me.
- You're all wrong.

559
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:41,195
I can hardly stand to be in the same
room with her ever since Pete died.

560
00:41:41,269 --> 00:41:44,325
- Why?
- I don't know. It gives me the willies.

561
00:41:44,402 --> 00:41:47,459
That's why I've always had you around
when we've been rehearsing the code.

562
00:41:47,535 --> 00:41:49,728
- You've noticed that, haven't you?
- Yes, but...

563
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:53,290
I tell you, I haven't been
alone with her for 10 seconds.

564
00:41:53,368 --> 00:41:57,027
All I want is that code.
I'm telling you true.

565
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:00,624
- But you're going away with her.
- You're coming with us, aren't you?

566
00:42:03,833 --> 00:42:06,663
You want me to?

567
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:10,256
- You don't think I'd go without you.
- You mean that, Stan?

568
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:14,060
Absolutely. You satisfied?

569
00:42:14,133 --> 00:42:19,463
Oh, Stan, I don't care about
nothing now. Nothing in the world.

570
00:42:54,595 --> 00:42:58,687
<i>The old geezer's trap
was hangin'open a mile...</i>

571
00:42:58,762 --> 00:43:01,819
<i>lappin'up every word the kid handed him.</i>

572
00:43:01,894 --> 00:43:04,190
<i>- Stan.!
- You were great, Stan.!</i>

573
00:43:04,261 --> 00:43:06,954
- Where'd you go to?
- I hid in my truck.

574
00:43:07,028 --> 00:43:10,687
Stan, you sure done noble. I always
knew you was a born mentalist.

575
00:43:10,761 --> 00:43:13,625
Imagine giving a cop a cold
reading and getting by with it!

576
00:43:13,694 --> 00:43:16,887
- Look who I had for a teacher.
- Nice work, kid. You're a real carny.

577
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,289
You ought to have heard Stan spout gospel
to that hypocrite. It was like Sunday school.

578
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,984
- You must've been raised pretty religious.
- Yeah, in a county orphanage.

579
00:43:25,059 --> 00:43:28,048
- Didn't you have any folks?
- If I did, they weren't much interested.

580
00:43:28,126 --> 00:43:31,182
- Where'd you learn all this gospel?
- In the orphanage.

581
00:43:31,258 --> 00:43:34,486
That's what they used to give us on Sunday
after beating us black-and-blue all week.

582
00:43:34,558 --> 00:43:38,012
Then when I ran away, they
threw me in the reform school.

583
00:43:38,091 --> 00:43:43,352
But that's where I got wise. I let the
chaplain save me and got a parole in no time.

584
00:43:43,424 --> 00:43:45,651
Boy, how I went for salvation.

585
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:50,280
Comes in handy in a jam. Many's the judge
I've good-talked right out of his shirt.

586
00:43:50,356 --> 00:43:53,379
Son, you can have mine right now.

587
00:43:53,456 --> 00:43:57,354
Let's give Stan a big hand. We'd be in
a peck of trouble if it wasn't for him.

588
00:43:57,423 --> 00:43:59,945
And I'd be in jail!

589
00:44:00,023 --> 00:44:02,215
How about some beer, partner?

590
00:44:02,289 --> 00:44:04,948
Oh, Bruno, cheer up. There'll
be no more trouble tonight.

591
00:44:05,022 --> 00:44:07,016
We'll open tomorrow night and
pack 'em in. Won't we, boss?

592
00:44:07,117 --> 00:44:09,511
Best advertising in the world.

593
00:44:09,588 --> 00:44:13,281
- Hello, Bruno.
- Where did you go? I been lookin' all over.

594
00:44:13,354 --> 00:44:17,683
- She was in her truck.
- But I went in the tent and yelled my head off.

595
00:44:17,754 --> 00:44:20,618
<i>- Why didn't you answer me?
- Where did you think I was?</i>

596
00:44:27,287 --> 00:44:29,980
What are you looking at me like that for?

597
00:44:33,552 --> 00:44:37,109
<i>- Uh-oh. -
That's what I say.</i>

598
00:44:37,185 --> 00:44:40,208
Huh?

599
00:44:40,286 --> 00:44:43,911
Oh, what's the diff?
She's here now, isn't she?

600
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:50,775
And by the way, Bruno, where did you
run off to when the trouble started?

601
00:44:50,851 --> 00:44:55,545
You're not talking to that hayseed
cop. You're talking to Bruno. Savvy?

602
00:44:55,617 --> 00:44:59,105
When you get through with him, there's
a couple questions I'd like to ask.

603
00:44:59,183 --> 00:45:02,671
Molly, you and Stan gonna get married?

604
00:45:04,017 --> 00:45:06,778
Stan, you gonna marry Molly?

605
00:45:09,216 --> 00:45:13,114
<i>- You people trying to kid somebody?
- And you aren't either.</i>

606
00:45:13,182 --> 00:45:16,545
Oh, Stan, Stan, aren't you the foxy one...

607
00:45:16,615 --> 00:45:19,671
making out like you never knew this
child was on the face of the earth.

608
00:45:19,748 --> 00:45:23,373
- You sure fooled me.
- He didn't fool me.

609
00:45:23,447 --> 00:45:25,743
What's going on here?

610
00:45:28,547 --> 00:45:32,035
<i>Let's drink to the bride and groom.!
May all their children be acrobats.!</i>

611
00:45:32,114 --> 00:45:35,602
<i>- You're drunk.!
- I'll give the bride away.!</i>

612
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,872
That's a good idea. Huh, Stan?

613
00:45:37,946 --> 00:45:39,912
- Bruno!
- Molly, you stay out of this!

614
00:45:39,979 --> 00:45:41,911
Bruno!

615
00:45:47,045 --> 00:45:50,670
- He can't stand much more.
- I don't care. You gonna do as I say?

616
00:45:50,745 --> 00:45:54,734
- You trying to kill him?
- All he's gotta do is touch my hand.

617
00:46:09,876 --> 00:46:13,672
There he is, Molly! Now
we get a parson! Hey, boss?

618
00:46:13,743 --> 00:46:15,030
Sure.

619
00:46:15,131 --> 00:46:17,903
Come on, folks. Let's drink
to the bride and groom.

620
00:46:36,041 --> 00:46:39,803
- I'm sorry, Stan.
- What for?

621
00:46:39,873 --> 00:46:42,930
I know how you feel.

622
00:46:43,007 --> 00:46:45,438
You didn't want to marry me.

623
00:46:45,506 --> 00:46:49,700
Sure, I did, honey. But
I didn't want it to be...

624
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:52,829
Well, you know, everybody thinking...

625
00:46:52,906 --> 00:46:56,429
- Cooks the carnival for me.
- Why?

626
00:46:56,505 --> 00:47:01,369
Well, there I was, on the top of the
world, kingpin of the whole outfit...

627
00:47:08,504 --> 00:47:10,969
Say!

628
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:14,764
Maybe it's the best thing
that could have happened.

629
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:21,931
I've got the code, you
know it as well as I do...

630
00:47:22,003 --> 00:47:24,696
and I've got you!

631
00:47:28,269 --> 00:47:32,599
Ah, Zeena and Mr. Bruno, they
aren't so smart as they think.

632
00:47:32,669 --> 00:47:34,896
We'll show 'em.

633
00:47:34,968 --> 00:47:37,695
- You're not sorry?
- I should say not.

634
00:47:37,768 --> 00:47:38,800
Not one bit?

635
00:47:38,901 --> 00:47:41,165
Why should I be? I've never
been so tickled in my life.

636
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:43,791
You're sure? You're not just saying this?

637
00:47:43,867 --> 00:47:48,993
- Baby, there's only one thing I'm sorry about.
- What's that?

638
00:47:49,067 --> 00:47:51,692
That I didn't think of this sooner.

639
00:47:51,767 --> 00:47:54,198
Oh, Stan, darling, you're wonderful.

640
00:47:54,267 --> 00:47:57,630
I'll be a good wife to you.
I'll love you to pieces.

641
00:47:57,699 --> 00:47:59,927
I'll try to be everything you want...

642
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,523
and I'll not even look
at another fella, never!

643
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:36,318
I have another question here. Are you ready?

644
00:48:36,396 --> 00:48:38,623
Yes.

645
00:48:38,695 --> 00:48:43,218
Can you tell me how this question is signed?

646
00:48:45,161 --> 00:48:47,752
It is signed, "Mother".

647
00:48:47,828 --> 00:48:50,851
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

648
00:48:54,361 --> 00:48:58,918
<i>Now then, will you read the
question for me, word by word...</i>

649
00:48:58,994 --> 00:49:01,289
exactly as written.

650
00:49:03,526 --> 00:49:08,651
"Is the young man my daughter has
written to me about worthy of her?"

651
00:49:08,726 --> 00:49:12,749
- Was that your question?
- Word for word.

652
00:49:19,025 --> 00:49:21,991
Are you able to answer
this specific question?

653
00:49:22,058 --> 00:49:24,683
Yes.

654
00:49:24,758 --> 00:49:28,849
I think that you and your husband are
going to be very happy about this matter.

655
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:34,083
The young man your daughter has chosen is
very rare in this day and age... a good man.

656
00:49:34,156 --> 00:49:39,418
<i>He not only attends church on Sunday, but
he practices his religion seven days a week.</i>

657
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:42,512
Your daughter is much the same type...

658
00:49:42,589 --> 00:49:46,918
thanks to the splendid heritage of good
health, both physical and spiritual...

659
00:49:46,989 --> 00:49:49,251
<i>for they go hand in hand...</i>

660
00:49:49,322 --> 00:49:52,981
<i>which you and your husband have
so generously passed on to her.</i>

661
00:49:53,055 --> 00:49:56,748
<i>If I were an artist and wanted
to paint a full-length portrait...</i>

662
00:49:56,822 --> 00:49:59,014
of the American family...

663
00:49:59,088 --> 00:50:01,485
I could ask for no better models.

664
00:50:17,253 --> 00:50:21,151
<i>The gentleman has a question. What is it?</i>

665
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:24,582
The question is, will I feel better tomorrow?

666
00:50:26,919 --> 00:50:29,646
- Have you an answer?
- Yes.

667
00:50:29,718 --> 00:50:33,116
<i>This boy's got something.</i>

668
00:50:33,185 --> 00:50:36,981
- You're not taking him seriously.
- Why not?

669
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:39,482
I'll show you.

670
00:50:39,551 --> 00:50:43,642
- Isn't it some sort of a code they use?
- Of course.

671
00:50:43,717 --> 00:50:47,274
Notice how deliberately
she accents certain words.

672
00:50:57,048 --> 00:50:59,276
Thank you.

673
00:50:59,349 --> 00:51:03,440
This question... can you
tell me how it is signed?

674
00:51:03,514 --> 00:51:07,378
- It is signed with the initial "R."
- That's right!

675
00:51:09,214 --> 00:51:13,475
Can you describe the person
who wrote this question?

676
00:51:13,547 --> 00:51:17,639
- She's very beautiful.
- I agree with you, Mr. Stanton.

677
00:51:17,714 --> 00:51:19,737
She's quite beautiful.

678
00:51:19,814 --> 00:51:21,972
Now read the lady's question.

679
00:51:24,213 --> 00:51:29,270
The question is, "Do you think my mother
will recover from her present illness?"

680
00:51:29,346 --> 00:51:32,107
Is that correct?

681
00:51:32,179 --> 00:51:35,168
What is your answer?

682
00:51:35,246 --> 00:51:39,234
I'm afraid a truthful reply to that
question will appear rather strange.

683
00:51:39,311 --> 00:51:43,970
- I don't know whether I should answer it or not.
- Why?

684
00:51:46,544 --> 00:51:49,476
I get the impression
that the lady's mother...

685
00:51:49,544 --> 00:51:51,877
has been dead for some time.

686
00:51:54,843 --> 00:51:58,605
<i>If that is incorrect, will
the lady please say so.</i>

687
00:52:06,475 --> 00:52:10,066
I must assume that the
lady's silence means assent.

688
00:52:36,505 --> 00:52:40,597
- Here's a hundred blank records from the
Record-A-Phone company. - Just a minute.

689
00:52:40,672 --> 00:52:42,967
- Is Miss Ritter in?
- What is your name?

690
00:52:43,038 --> 00:52:46,163
- I think she's expecting me.
- Will you come this way, please.

691
00:52:48,905 --> 00:52:52,393
- Thank you.
- Miss Ritter will be free in a few minutes.

692
00:52:52,471 --> 00:52:54,528
Fine.

693
00:53:06,669 --> 00:53:11,298
Hello.

694
00:53:12,836 --> 00:53:16,733
- I suppose you must think this rather odd.
- Why?

695
00:53:16,802 --> 00:53:22,564
- Me writing you that note.
- I get a laundry basket full of'em every day.

696
00:53:22,635 --> 00:53:24,760
Won't you sit down?

697
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:27,460
What did you want to see me about?

698
00:53:27,535 --> 00:53:31,864
My friends and I were very much
impressed with your performance.

699
00:53:33,734 --> 00:53:36,461
But that isn't why you asked me to drop in.

700
00:53:36,534 --> 00:53:39,931
No, it isn't.

701
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,897
- How did you happen to know so much about me?
- I read your mind.

702
00:53:44,966 --> 00:53:48,625
You mean to claim you can actually do that?

703
00:53:48,699 --> 00:53:52,290
How else would I know that your mother
was dead? I'd never seen you before.

704
00:53:52,365 --> 00:53:54,388
You didn't make a reservation.

705
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:57,988
- The mitre d' didn't know who you were.
- That's true.

706
00:53:58,065 --> 00:54:02,157
That fella you were with... the mitre
d' says he's a big guy in this town.

707
00:54:02,231 --> 00:54:06,755
- That, uh, Ezra Grindle. You gonna marry him?
- I?

708
00:54:08,797 --> 00:54:11,592
I got a feeling there
was something between you.

709
00:54:11,663 --> 00:54:13,856
He's a patient of mine.

710
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:21,955
Now, in regard to this feeling you have...

711
00:54:22,029 --> 00:54:26,552
- psychologists admit the validity of
mental telepathy under certain... - Uh-huh.

712
00:54:26,629 --> 00:54:30,220
I thought this looked
like one of those joints.

713
00:54:30,295 --> 00:54:33,385
You ever been psychoanalyzed?

714
00:54:33,461 --> 00:54:36,825
No. I saw one in a murder movie once.

715
00:54:36,894 --> 00:54:40,758
But a good mentalist could have straightened
the whole thing out in five minutes.

716
00:54:40,827 --> 00:54:46,088
I'm sure you could have. How
did you know my mother was dead?

717
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:51,286
I didn't. I just had a feeling that
your question wasn't on the level.

718
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:55,257
I figured you were trying to make a
chump out of me. Just common sense.

719
00:54:55,326 --> 00:54:57,883
It's not so common.

720
00:54:57,959 --> 00:55:00,686
<i>- I don't know about that.
- Why?</i>

721
00:55:00,758 --> 00:55:04,122
I've got that same feeling right now.

722
00:55:07,024 --> 00:55:10,854
What's on your mind,
lady? What are you up to?

723
00:55:10,924 --> 00:55:16,322
Don't worry, Carlisle. I never
make the same mistake twice.

724
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:19,117
<i>Me neither.</i>

725
00:55:22,023 --> 00:55:24,251
Yes?

726
00:55:24,323 --> 00:55:26,915
She is? But...

727
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:30,046
I'll be through in a minute. I'll buzz you.

728
00:55:30,122 --> 00:55:32,553
We'll have to continue this in our next.

729
00:55:32,622 --> 00:55:35,645
There's a patient I'll have
to see. An emergency call.

730
00:55:35,722 --> 00:55:38,051
You can go out this way.

731
00:55:44,021 --> 00:55:46,384
Well, I'll be seeing you.

732
00:55:46,454 --> 00:55:48,647
- When?
- I don't know yet.

733
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:51,182
You can call me at my
apartment. It's in the book.

734
00:55:51,283 --> 00:55:52,414
I may give you a ring.

735
00:55:52,487 --> 00:55:56,044
Fine. I don't come to the office
on Wednesdays or Saturdays.

736
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:59,051
I heard you the first time.

737
00:56:10,317 --> 00:56:12,340
How do you do, Mrs. Peabody?

738
00:56:12,417 --> 00:56:15,507
Sorry to rush in on you like this, my dear.

739
00:56:15,583 --> 00:56:17,811
It's quite all right, Mrs. Peabody.

740
00:56:17,883 --> 00:56:19,973
That's what I'm here for.

741
00:56:20,049 --> 00:56:23,845
Really, I'm... I'm terribly upset.

742
00:56:23,916 --> 00:56:25,973
Now, what seems to be the trouble?

743
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:29,310
I had another one of those
dreams about my daughter Carol.

744
00:56:29,382 --> 00:56:35,315
You know, I never dream of
her as dead, but always alive.

745
00:56:35,382 --> 00:56:37,813
- Very much alive.
- I know.

746
00:56:37,881 --> 00:56:41,142
Now, you just come over here
and make yourself comfortable.

747
00:56:46,047 --> 00:56:49,137
I'm not to be disturbed
under any circumstances.

748
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:55,739
Now just lie back here.

749
00:56:55,813 --> 00:56:57,972
There. Is that better?

750
00:56:58,046 --> 00:57:00,273
- Mm, my dear.
- Good.

751
00:57:09,745 --> 00:57:11,734
I wouldn't have bothered you...

752
00:57:11,812 --> 00:57:14,642
only you said dreams were
important in cases like mine.

753
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:18,335
They're one of the clues we
have to the subconscious mind.

754
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:21,501
It's a psychologist's way of
looking at the patient's tongue.

755
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:27,237
- I'll telephone you tomorrow morning.
- Fine. Good-bye, Mrs. Peabody.

756
00:57:46,341 --> 00:57:48,330
You make a record of everything?

757
00:57:48,407 --> 00:57:51,896
- It's a wonderful idea.
- How did you get back in here?

758
00:57:51,974 --> 00:57:53,962
I fixed the latch on
the door when I went out.

759
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,097
I wanted to get a line on you.

760
00:57:56,174 --> 00:57:58,731
Maybe we can do a little business after all.

761
00:57:58,807 --> 00:58:02,069
You make one of these things
every time you give a treatment?

762
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:06,297
How could you do such a horrible thing?

763
00:58:06,373 --> 00:58:09,305
You don't realize what you've got here.

764
00:58:11,505 --> 00:58:15,800
We could set this town on its ear.

765
00:58:15,871 --> 00:58:18,167
Or is that what you
wanted to talk to me about?

766
00:58:18,238 --> 00:58:20,295
Are you insane?

767
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:23,667
That's not a bad hunch, lady.

768
00:58:23,738 --> 00:58:25,761
If you got clients like that Grindle...

769
00:58:25,837 --> 00:58:29,167
you must be up to your knees in
that Lake Shore and Lake Forest mob.

770
00:58:29,237 --> 00:58:31,498
And with that stuff you've recorded...

771
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:33,593
you have no idea what I could do with it.

772
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:37,102
<i>- In a nightclub.
- Are you crazy?</i>

773
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:40,658
I'm getting out of there
as soon as my contract's up.

774
00:58:40,736 --> 00:58:42,759
You should see some of the letters I get.

775
00:58:42,836 --> 00:58:45,700
Couple of big spook people are after me now.

776
00:58:47,536 --> 00:58:50,229
But I've got an altogether different idea.

777
00:58:50,302 --> 00:58:54,893
Look here, Mr. Carlisle. If you
ever so much as mention to anybody...

778
00:58:54,968 --> 00:58:57,297
Please. Who do you think I am?

779
00:58:57,368 --> 00:58:59,925
I haven't sufficient flow
of speech to go into that.

780
00:59:00,001 --> 00:59:03,592
But I want you to know that I make
these records only for my personal study.

781
00:59:03,667 --> 00:59:05,724
Mm-hmm.

782
00:59:05,801 --> 00:59:08,062
- You're not a regular M.D., are you?
- Of course not.

783
00:59:08,133 --> 00:59:10,156
But anything my patients
reveal to me is as sacred...

784
00:59:10,233 --> 00:59:12,664
as though it were given under the seal
of the confessional, is that clear?

785
00:59:12,733 --> 00:59:16,426
All right. All right. You don't
have to get on your soapbox.

786
00:59:16,499 --> 00:59:19,294
I'm going to be strictly on the
level about this whole thing myself.

787
00:59:19,366 --> 00:59:22,627
Get out of here. I should have
known you were that kind of...

788
00:59:22,698 --> 00:59:25,960
Uh-uh-uh. Takes
one to catch one.

789
00:59:26,031 --> 00:59:28,020
Get out.

790
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:01,584
Stan, you're not listening to me.

791
01:00:01,661 --> 01:00:04,059
Oh, I'm sorry, baby. What were you saying?

792
01:00:04,128 --> 01:00:06,753
- I've got a surprise for you.
- What kind of surprise?

793
01:00:06,828 --> 01:00:09,760
You'll see.

794
01:00:09,827 --> 01:00:12,453
It's not locked.

795
01:00:14,827 --> 01:00:16,816
Hello, Stan.

796
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:20,890
<i>You very surprised?</i>

797
01:00:20,959 --> 01:00:22,948
Who wouldn't be?

798
01:00:23,026 --> 01:00:25,719
The... The carnival was
rained out in Kankakee...

799
01:00:25,793 --> 01:00:28,850
so... so I thought that now
would be a good time to... to...

800
01:00:28,926 --> 01:00:31,755
A good time to what?

801
01:00:31,825 --> 01:00:34,087
- Well, just get together again.
- Sure.

802
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:37,125
What's the use of people
being mad at each other?

803
01:00:37,191 --> 01:00:39,749
It sure turned out for the best,
huh, Stan? You can't say it didn't.

804
01:00:39,825 --> 01:00:42,654
I'll say. Look at you. Look
at Molly. You're the tops.

805
01:00:42,724 --> 01:00:44,747
You're going like a million dollars.

806
01:00:44,824 --> 01:00:46,983
When you come home at night,
you're singing like a lark.

807
01:00:47,058 --> 01:00:49,580
Now, what could be sweeter?

808
01:00:49,657 --> 01:00:52,623
Come on, professor, give your old pal a kiss.

809
01:00:52,689 --> 01:00:55,712
Well, you're right at that.

810
01:00:56,890 --> 01:00:58,981
Bruno.

811
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:03,182
Excuse me while I get out of these clothes.

812
01:01:04,555 --> 01:01:06,987
<i>Same old Stan.</i>

813
01:01:13,788 --> 01:01:16,277
Molly, it doesn't look like you'll
shop for baby clothes this year.

814
01:01:16,355 --> 01:01:18,343
- I won't?
- Mm-mmm.

815
01:01:22,654 --> 01:01:24,881
Oh, Bruno? Here.

816
01:01:24,953 --> 01:01:27,283
Oh, throw that away.

817
01:01:27,353 --> 01:01:30,080
Well, thanks, Stan. You
look nice and comfortable.

818
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:33,812
A man's coming to give him a
massage. He's not sleeping so good.

819
01:01:33,886 --> 01:01:36,148
- You still monkeying around with those things?
- Yep.

820
01:01:36,219 --> 01:01:39,412
What's wrong with them? Everything
they say about me has come true.

821
01:01:39,485 --> 01:01:41,474
Another wire from New York.

822
01:01:41,552 --> 01:01:43,575
<i>Is that where you're opening next?</i>

823
01:01:43,652 --> 01:01:46,209
<i>Oh, they're offering us the moon.</i>

824
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:48,375
But Stan hasn't made up his mind yet.

825
01:01:48,451 --> 01:01:50,440
- You're making a mistake.
- Who?

826
01:01:50,518 --> 01:01:54,348
You. If you make the change
in the work you're thinking of.

827
01:01:54,418 --> 01:01:56,441
- You told her about it.
- How could I?

828
01:01:56,517 --> 01:01:58,540
- I haven't seen her since...
- How else did she find out?

829
01:01:58,617 --> 01:02:00,742
- I haven't said a thing.
- I didn't want you to breathe it to a soul.

830
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:03,180
She didn't tell me about it.
It's all here, plain as day.

831
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:08,148
It doesn't say what this new stunt is, but
you're going to the top like a skyrocket.

832
01:02:08,216 --> 01:02:11,181
Stan, turn that card over and
we'll see how it'll end up.

833
01:02:11,249 --> 01:02:13,272
- Who else did you tell?
- Look, Stan...

834
01:02:13,349 --> 01:02:15,372
- Turn that card over.
- What do I care what the card says.

835
01:02:15,449 --> 01:02:18,108
Leave it alone.

836
01:02:18,182 --> 01:02:20,613
<i>The hanged man.</i>

837
01:02:20,681 --> 01:02:23,306
- You better watch yourself.
- Is that bad?

838
01:02:23,381 --> 01:02:25,846
Not if he doesn't go against it.

839
01:02:28,214 --> 01:02:31,179
But I thought... Wasn't that Pete's card?

840
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:33,611
Sure. Now it's yours.

841
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:37,077
You hear that? I told you that new
stunt was all wrong. I told you...

842
01:02:37,147 --> 01:02:40,874
Oh, don't be a sap. This is
the stuff she feeds to chumps.

843
01:02:40,946 --> 01:02:42,935
- It's nothing but a deck of gypsy cards.
- I don't care.

844
01:02:43,012 --> 01:02:45,807
- Zeena believes them.
- Sure I do. So does Stan.

845
01:02:45,879 --> 01:02:49,277
- You're crazy. Why should I?
- They were right for Pete, weren't they?

846
01:02:51,212 --> 01:02:53,700
Get out. I know what I'm doing.

847
01:02:53,779 --> 01:02:56,210
I don't need any help from a
couple of cheap carnival freaks.

848
01:02:56,278 --> 01:02:58,743
Go peddle your stuff
where it belongs. Get out!

849
01:02:58,811 --> 01:03:01,971
- Stan!
- Who are you calling a freak?

850
01:03:02,045 --> 01:03:06,136
Bruno. We gotta get that 1:30 bus.

851
01:03:12,777 --> 01:03:15,436
Come on.

852
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:17,771
- Zeena, I'm sorry.
- Forget it.

853
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:34,466
What got into you, acting so crazy?

854
01:03:34,541 --> 01:03:36,700
It's all your fault. I'll
tell you something again.

855
01:03:36,775 --> 01:03:38,763
- Stan, I never...
- Don't lie to me.

856
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:41,306
<i>You did write to her about it, didn't you?</i>

857
01:03:44,107 --> 01:03:46,766
- Excuse me. I forgot my cards.
- Oh, yes.

858
01:03:51,939 --> 01:03:54,166
Oh, there's one on the floor.

859
01:03:58,772 --> 01:04:00,965
The hanged man.

860
01:04:15,104 --> 01:04:18,796
- Feeling better?
- Not a bit.

861
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:22,325
Yeah, you're still sweating.
I'll have to close up those pores.

862
01:04:30,935 --> 01:04:33,457
This always seems to freshen you up.

863
01:04:35,268 --> 01:04:37,257
Stan!

864
01:04:38,868 --> 01:04:40,857
What's the matter with him tonight?

865
01:04:42,801 --> 01:04:44,858
- What's in that bottle?
- Nothing.

866
01:04:44,934 --> 01:04:47,957
Just pure alcohol. Same as I always use.

867
01:05:22,498 --> 01:05:27,021
I felt pretty shaky about the whole
thing, but I didn't let it ride me.

868
01:05:27,097 --> 01:05:30,926
Until tonight, the smell of
alcohol didn't bother me at all.

869
01:05:30,996 --> 01:05:35,621
I hadn't thought about
Pete in a long, long time.

870
01:05:35,696 --> 01:05:39,355
But seeing Zeena again and all
that stuff about the cards, it...

871
01:05:39,429 --> 01:05:42,054
it sort of turned my stomach inside out.

872
01:05:42,129 --> 01:05:47,584
That's quite natural. We
call it total recall. Go on.

873
01:05:48,795 --> 01:05:50,784
That's all.

874
01:05:50,862 --> 01:05:53,350
There's nothing more to tell.

875
01:05:53,428 --> 01:05:56,053
I walked around for an hour
or so trying to cool off.

876
01:05:56,128 --> 01:05:59,355
Nothing worked, so I-I came here.

877
01:06:03,327 --> 01:06:07,691
Quarter after 7:00? I've gotta beat it.

878
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,988
Well, what do you make of it?

879
01:06:10,059 --> 01:06:13,219
I think you're a perfectly
normal human being.

880
01:06:13,292 --> 01:06:15,553
<i>Selfish and ruthless
when you want something...</i>

881
01:06:15,625 --> 01:06:18,614
<i>generous and kindly when you've got it.</i>

882
01:06:18,692 --> 01:06:21,249
Although Pete died as a
result of an accident...

883
01:06:21,325 --> 01:06:24,984
you naturally felt a sense of
guilt because you profited by it.

884
01:06:25,058 --> 01:06:27,183
<i>Am I right?</i>

885
01:06:28,457 --> 01:06:30,582
Yeah, I guess so.

886
01:06:30,657 --> 01:06:35,248
As I understand it, you never
told Zeena or anybody else...

887
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:37,313
about giving Pete that bottle.

888
01:06:38,823 --> 01:06:40,914
You think I'm crazy?

889
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:43,182
I think you showed good sense.

890
01:06:43,256 --> 01:06:46,744
You might have had a hard time of
it trying to explain to the police...

891
01:06:46,822 --> 01:06:48,845
under the circumstances.

892
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:52,410
Maybe I didn't show such good
sense in spilling it to you.

893
01:06:52,489 --> 01:06:54,920
Then what did you come to me for?

894
01:06:54,988 --> 01:06:58,442
I figured that if anyone was gonna help
me, it'd have to be somebody like you.

895
01:06:58,521 --> 01:07:00,487
Thank you very much, Mr. Carlisle.

896
01:07:00,554 --> 01:07:04,543
What a chump I was to fall
for Zeena and those cards.

897
01:07:04,621 --> 01:07:08,144
Letting a little thing like a whiff
of alcohol make me blow my top.

898
01:07:08,221 --> 01:07:12,243
Then you're not going to let
it influence you in the least?

899
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:15,013
Nope. I'm going right
ahead the way I figured.

900
01:07:15,086 --> 01:07:17,779
The spook racket. I was made for it.

901
01:07:20,419 --> 01:07:22,942
I suppose you expect to be paid for this.

902
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:25,577
- What do you think?
- How much?

903
01:07:25,652 --> 01:07:28,083
- Nothing at all.
- Hmm?

904
01:07:28,152 --> 01:07:30,344
Professional courtesy.

905
01:07:30,418 --> 01:07:32,941
Well, maybe I can return the favor someday.

906
01:07:33,019 --> 01:07:35,848
- Maybe you can.
- What do you mean?

907
01:07:35,917 --> 01:07:38,974
Remember? Takes one to catch one.

908
01:07:47,284 --> 01:07:50,545
If this is answered right,
I'll pay you all 10%.

909
01:07:50,617 --> 01:07:53,242
Have you an answer for this question?

910
01:07:53,316 --> 01:07:56,111
- Oh, I'm afraid not.
- Why?

911
01:07:56,183 --> 01:07:59,377
Because that has to do with the stock market.

912
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:03,882
A labyrinth whose eccentricities no mentalist
of my acquaintance has ever been able to solve.

913
01:08:03,949 --> 01:08:06,210
As a matter of fact, I tried
it two or three times myself...

914
01:08:06,282 --> 01:08:08,857
and find that I can do much
better at the racetrack.

915
01:08:08,958 --> 01:08:10,146
That's very funny.

916
01:08:10,215 --> 01:08:13,510
- Took me 20 years to find that out.
- Good evening.

917
01:08:13,581 --> 01:08:16,069
- Have you written out a question?
- Yes.

918
01:08:16,147 --> 01:08:18,170
Thank you.

919
01:08:18,248 --> 01:08:20,237
I have a question here.

920
01:08:20,314 --> 01:08:22,303
Will you tell me how it is signed?

921
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:27,608
I get the impression "Mrs. S.P."

922
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:29,702
But I have a feeling that's incorrect.

923
01:08:29,779 --> 01:08:32,302
Why do you feel that is incorrect?

924
01:08:32,379 --> 01:08:36,471
I don't know. But would you ask
the lady with the pearl necklace...

925
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:40,671
<i>if it shouldn't be Mrs. A.P... "A"for Addie.</i>

926
01:08:41,945 --> 01:08:44,433
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

927
01:08:44,511 --> 01:08:46,942
The lady says yes.

928
01:08:48,345 --> 01:08:51,936
Now will you please answer her question.

929
01:08:52,011 --> 01:08:55,773
The lady wishes to know if she
will ever see her daughter again.

930
01:08:55,844 --> 01:08:59,241
<i>The answer is yes...</i>

931
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:05,072
if she believes in the hereafter,
a life beyond the grave.

932
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:09,934
Is that true? Has your daughter passed on?

933
01:09:12,009 --> 01:09:14,941
<i>- Yes.
- Wait.!</i>

934
01:09:15,009 --> 01:09:17,133
Don't anybody move.

935
01:09:27,107 --> 01:09:30,232
I see someone standing
between me and that lady.

936
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:37,831
The figure is very dim.

937
01:09:39,106 --> 01:09:41,538
But I see it's a girl.

938
01:09:41,607 --> 01:09:44,436
A lovely girl of 16.

939
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:51,894
I get the name "Caroline".

940
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,200
That...

941
01:09:56,271 --> 01:09:59,101
That's my daughter's name.

942
01:09:59,171 --> 01:10:01,932
That's... That's Carol.

943
01:10:03,604 --> 01:10:07,627
Yes, she... she wants to speak to you.

944
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:14,028
She says...

945
01:10:14,103 --> 01:10:16,466
<i>Stan.!</i>

946
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:23,227
- Stan! Stan!
- Gentlemen, gentlemen, please, please.

947
01:10:32,401 --> 01:10:34,696
<i>"Chicago, Illinois. The city of Chicago...</i>

948
01:10:34,767 --> 01:10:37,199
"finds itself with a mixed
personality on its hands.

949
01:10:37,268 --> 01:10:41,029
"Stanton Carlisle, known as the
Great Stanton, nightclub mentalist...

950
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:43,589
"fell into a deep trance
during his act in a nightclub.

951
01:10:43,667 --> 01:10:47,689
"Before doing so, he was able to
talk to and see, so he claims...

952
01:10:47,766 --> 01:10:50,664
"the departed daughter of a
famous Chicago society woman.

953
01:10:50,733 --> 01:10:53,392
"Many proclaim him to
possess spiritual phenomena.

954
01:10:53,466 --> 01:10:56,057
"Sir Oliver Green, famous
spirit sleuth of England...

955
01:10:56,132 --> 01:10:59,188
"says that Stanton's contact
is undoubtedly genuine.

956
01:10:59,265 --> 01:11:03,561
But in the meantime, Professor Samuel
Kaufman Brown proclaims him a trickster".

957
01:11:03,632 --> 01:11:06,257
<i>Addie, this is absurd.</i>

958
01:11:06,332 --> 01:11:11,059
<i>I say again, I am neither
a child nor an imbecile.</i>

959
01:11:11,130 --> 01:11:13,153
And I won't be treated as one.

960
01:11:13,231 --> 01:11:16,993
I didn't hear you knock. Take
the tea things, please, Maude.

961
01:11:20,597 --> 01:11:22,586
Ezra.

962
01:11:24,063 --> 01:11:26,052
Ezra, please.

963
01:11:28,330 --> 01:11:33,489
Ezra, I know you were deeply
devoted to my late husband...

964
01:11:33,562 --> 01:11:37,050
and I am grateful to you for
your interest in my welfare.

965
01:11:37,128 --> 01:11:40,787
But I won't have any further interference.

966
01:11:46,561 --> 01:11:52,356
This young man has brought me the
greatest spiritual comfort I've ever known.

967
01:11:52,427 --> 01:11:58,053
And I am going to continue to do
everything I can, regardless of cost...

968
01:11:58,126 --> 01:12:03,285
to make it possible for him to bring that
same spiritual comfort to other people.

969
01:12:08,259 --> 01:12:10,248
If I had my way...

970
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:14,314
I'd build him the finest
tabernacle in the world.

971
01:12:22,457 --> 01:12:26,855
I can't figure it. Addie's usually
so levelheaded about everything.

972
01:12:26,923 --> 01:12:29,082
That's what disturbs me.

973
01:12:29,157 --> 01:12:32,384
Maybe she might not be so wrong
about this young chap after all.

974
01:12:32,456 --> 01:12:37,411
Nonsense. He's nothing but an
uncommonly shrewd young trickster.

975
01:12:37,489 --> 01:12:42,546
I have seen him work, and I grant
you, he has personality and flair.

976
01:12:42,622 --> 01:12:44,713
But as far as Addie's concerned...

977
01:12:44,789 --> 01:12:48,221
he seems to be a bit of a hypnotist.

978
01:12:48,288 --> 01:12:53,845
You know, I'd like to get
a crack at this fellow.

979
01:12:53,921 --> 01:12:57,580
Do you think you could arrange
for me to see him privately?

980
01:12:57,654 --> 01:13:01,745
I don't see why not. It's obvious we
can't get anywhere with Mrs. Peabody.

981
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:05,081
- Well, get him on the phone now.
- Very well.

982
01:13:06,553 --> 01:13:08,814
I'll talk to him.

983
01:13:18,885 --> 01:13:20,874
<i>Stan?</i>

984
01:13:20,952 --> 01:13:23,747
Shh. Quit yelling. Turn off that boat.

985
01:13:27,884 --> 01:13:29,873
Well, how'd you come out with Grindle?

986
01:13:29,951 --> 01:13:32,883
Ah. No wonder he's the head of one
of the biggest outfits in the country.

987
01:13:32,951 --> 01:13:34,974
You didn't let him scare you off.

988
01:13:35,051 --> 01:13:37,039
Sit down. I wish you'd been there.

989
01:13:37,116 --> 01:13:39,412
He came in like a lion
and went out like a lamb.

990
01:13:39,483 --> 01:13:41,506
What happened?

991
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:43,776
Well, he started off by throwing
the district attorney at me.

992
01:13:43,850 --> 01:13:46,645
He was going to have me investigated.

993
01:13:46,716 --> 01:13:49,238
He said that the things I told
Mrs. Peabody about her daughter...

994
01:13:49,316 --> 01:13:52,441
anybody could have found out just by
looking through the newspaper files.

995
01:13:52,515 --> 01:13:55,504
I wish you could have seen his face
when I started slipping him the stuff...

996
01:13:55,582 --> 01:13:57,605
you gave me about his past.

997
01:13:57,682 --> 01:14:00,909
Especially when I asked him if there
was anything in the newspaper files...

998
01:14:00,981 --> 01:14:05,073
about his still being in love with
some dame that's been dead for 35 years.

999
01:14:05,148 --> 01:14:07,807
And when I called her Dory,

1000
01:14:07,881 --> 01:14:09,869
that put the old boy right on the carpet.

1001
01:14:09,947 --> 01:14:12,742
Have you got a cigarette?

1002
01:14:12,813 --> 01:14:15,370
- And he really did go for it?
- Go for it?

1003
01:14:15,446 --> 01:14:17,674
He stood there and shook like a leaf.

1004
01:14:17,746 --> 01:14:20,541
Came apart like a broken doll.

1005
01:14:20,613 --> 01:14:25,635
Crawled on his hands and knees to me and
begged me to get some message from this Dory.

1006
01:14:25,712 --> 01:14:29,508
Mm. Thank you.

1007
01:14:29,579 --> 01:14:32,340
But I told him he wasn't ready
yet for spiritual communion.

1008
01:14:32,412 --> 01:14:36,105
He should prepare himself a little
more with prayer and good works.

1009
01:14:36,178 --> 01:14:40,973
Well, he came back in about two
hours with a whole lot of good works.

1010
01:14:41,044 --> 01:14:44,238
He gave me enough to start building
the finest tabernacle in the country.

1011
01:14:44,311 --> 01:14:47,538
- Well, what's wrong with that?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

1012
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:50,337
And he's going to buy me
a radio station of my own.

1013
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:52,342
A radio station?

1014
01:14:52,410 --> 01:14:56,308
Yeah. But...

1015
01:14:56,375 --> 01:14:58,705
there's a big "if" to it.

1016
01:14:58,776 --> 01:15:03,174
He wants me to fix it so that he
can see this Dory with his own eyes.

1017
01:15:03,242 --> 01:15:06,696
- See her?
- Yeah, that's all.

1018
01:15:06,775 --> 01:15:10,263
That's all he wants, an absolute,
blown-in-the-glass clincher.

1019
01:15:11,408 --> 01:15:13,805
Oh.

1020
01:15:13,874 --> 01:15:15,999
"Oh" is right.

1021
01:15:16,074 --> 01:15:19,040
I think somebody must have
sold his mother a wooden nutmeg.

1022
01:15:19,107 --> 01:15:21,129
Yeah, that's the way he is.

1023
01:15:21,207 --> 01:15:24,367
We should have expected something like this.

1024
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:28,167
You don't have a picture of this Dory
dame in your files anyplace, do you?

1025
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:31,205
No, but it shouldn't be
too difficult to get one.

1026
01:15:31,272 --> 01:15:33,636
He has them in every room of his house.

1027
01:15:33,706 --> 01:15:35,694
Yeah.

1028
01:15:35,772 --> 01:15:38,567
Well, I've got the tabernacle
anyway, no matter what happens.

1029
01:15:38,638 --> 01:15:41,604
- How much did he give you?
- 150 grand.

1030
01:15:43,271 --> 01:15:45,260
Feels like it's in cash.

1031
01:15:45,338 --> 01:15:48,202
It is. He asked me to take it that way.

1032
01:15:48,271 --> 01:15:50,395
He said if I used his name, he'd deny it.

1033
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:52,901
- Why?
- Well, you don't think the old geezer...

1034
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:55,562
wants Mrs. Peabody or any
of the others to know that...

1035
01:15:55,636 --> 01:15:58,659
that's how he got me to turn down that
old firetrap that she was gonna give me.

1036
01:15:58,736 --> 01:16:02,668
- You got anyplace to stash it?
- I have a jewel safe.

1037
01:16:02,736 --> 01:16:05,201
What's the good of me putting it
away if you're gonna start building?

1038
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:10,031
I'm not going to start building anything
until we've got Grindle really in the bag.

1039
01:16:10,102 --> 01:16:12,294
This is only peanuts.

1040
01:16:12,368 --> 01:16:14,391
But it'll come in handy in
case anything goes wrong.

1041
01:16:16,601 --> 01:16:19,193
Stan, you're wonderful.
You think of everything.

1042
01:16:19,268 --> 01:16:22,461
- There's one thing I didn't think of.
- What's that?

1043
01:16:22,534 --> 01:16:25,625
If it was gonna be this chilly tonight,
I should have brought an overcoat.

1044
01:16:25,701 --> 01:16:28,632
Well, I'm freezing myself, but
I know a place where we can go.

1045
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:30,893
- Where?
- Funny I never thought of it before.

1046
01:16:30,967 --> 01:16:32,990
It's not very far from here either.

1047
01:16:33,066 --> 01:16:35,123
- You mean that place down the road?
- Don't be silly.

1048
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,189
I belong to the Rogers Park Beach Club.

1049
01:16:37,266 --> 01:16:40,390
- I have a cabana there.
- Yeah, I know a better place.

1050
01:16:40,465 --> 01:16:42,863
- Where?
- Marshall Field's window.

1051
01:16:42,933 --> 01:16:45,660
Nobody ever goes to the
beach club this time of year.

1052
01:16:45,732 --> 01:16:50,096
Nix. We don't wanna take any
chances. This thing's too big.

1053
01:16:50,165 --> 01:16:53,824
I'm surprised a smart cookie like you...

1054
01:16:53,898 --> 01:16:56,386
Supposing somebody saw us together
and Grindle found out about it.

1055
01:16:56,464 --> 01:16:58,622
Then where would we be?

1056
01:16:58,697 --> 01:17:01,458
Well, at least you can't say I didn't try.

1057
01:17:10,096 --> 01:17:12,561
Good night, Lilith. I'll
give you a buzz tomorrow.

1058
01:17:12,629 --> 01:17:14,618
Good night, Stan.

1059
01:17:29,894 --> 01:17:32,156
Mr. Carlisle? Special delivery, sir.

1060
01:17:32,228 --> 01:17:34,250
- Oh.
- Can you sign for it?

1061
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:44,323
- Here we are.
- Thank you, sir.

1062
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:46,882
- Here.
- Thank you.

1063
01:18:21,089 --> 01:18:24,612
Hello, dear. Did you sleep well?

1064
01:18:24,689 --> 01:18:27,280
Why didn't you wake me when you got up?

1065
01:18:27,355 --> 01:18:31,219
I have quite a difficult problem to solve, and
I don't seem to be able to make a dent in it.

1066
01:18:31,289 --> 01:18:34,312
- What's wrong?
- It's that new convert of mine.

1067
01:18:34,388 --> 01:18:36,718
Mr. Grindle?

1068
01:18:36,788 --> 01:18:40,379
It seems his conversion isn't
as complete as I thought it was.

1069
01:18:40,454 --> 01:18:43,817
Did he take back the money he
gave you for the tabernacle?

1070
01:18:43,887 --> 01:18:47,512
No. No, no. But before he goes any further...

1071
01:18:47,587 --> 01:18:51,246
he wants me to materialize the
spirit of his dead sweetheart.

1072
01:18:56,553 --> 01:18:58,542
But you can't do that.

1073
01:18:58,619 --> 01:19:01,517
I mean, you told Mrs. Peabody nobody could.

1074
01:19:01,586 --> 01:19:04,279
That's right.

1075
01:19:04,352 --> 01:19:06,340
But we've got to look
at it this way, darling.

1076
01:19:06,418 --> 01:19:08,782
A man's faith is trembling in the balance.

1077
01:19:08,852 --> 01:19:12,113
A man who was a confirmed skeptic
about anything relating to religion...

1078
01:19:12,185 --> 01:19:14,174
now stands upon the threshold.

1079
01:19:14,251 --> 01:19:18,649
The door is open. One more step
will bring him inside the fold.

1080
01:19:18,717 --> 01:19:23,648
What should I do? Should I let
the man's soul be lost forever?

1081
01:19:23,716 --> 01:19:26,580
Or should I stake my own to save it?

1082
01:19:28,416 --> 01:19:31,109
- Or yours?
- Mine?

1083
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:33,172
What have I got to do with it?

1084
01:19:34,283 --> 01:19:36,441
You?

1085
01:19:36,515 --> 01:19:38,572
You can help me.

1086
01:19:42,115 --> 01:19:46,570
I realize it's in the nature of a subterfuge,
but our motives are so pure, so unselfish.

1087
01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:48,978
Wait a minute, Stan.

1088
01:19:49,048 --> 01:19:51,513
Oh, honey, there isn't the
slightest bit of danger.

1089
01:19:51,581 --> 01:19:55,343
I won't let him get close enough to see anything
except that you are a young dame about her age.

1090
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:02,107
I knew it.

1091
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:04,873
<i>- I knew it!
- You knew what?</i>

1092
01:20:04,946 --> 01:20:09,003
<i>You never were on the level.
You lied to me. Zeena was right.</i>

1093
01:20:12,912 --> 01:20:15,310
- Walking out on me, huh?
- Look, Stan.

1094
01:20:15,379 --> 01:20:17,606
Anytime you wanna go
back into show business...

1095
01:20:17,678 --> 01:20:20,042
Yeah, you and all that
talk of yours about love.

1096
01:20:20,112 --> 01:20:22,134
You were going to be such a good wife to me.

1097
01:20:22,211 --> 01:20:25,075
I've tried to be. You know I'd do anything.

1098
01:20:25,144 --> 01:20:28,598
Sure, sure. Anything in
the world for me. Or to me.

1099
01:20:28,677 --> 01:20:31,142
- What do you mean, "to you"?
- What are you doing now?

1100
01:20:31,210 --> 01:20:33,869
What do you think the newspapers will
say when they find out about this?

1101
01:20:33,943 --> 01:20:36,773
- "Wife quits miracle worker".
- I won't say anything.

1102
01:20:36,843 --> 01:20:38,968
You can tell them I've
gone to visit some friends.

1103
01:20:39,043 --> 01:20:42,338
No, they'll follow you. They'll get
it out of Bruno or some of the others.

1104
01:20:42,409 --> 01:20:44,602
Honey, look. It's not me
that I'm thinking about.

1105
01:20:44,676 --> 01:20:47,664
But what about this poor guy
Grindle? What's gonna happen to him?

1106
01:20:47,742 --> 01:20:50,469
Mrs. Peabody, all those
other people that I've helped.

1107
01:20:50,542 --> 01:20:54,338
Look. Look at these.
Hundreds of them every day.

1108
01:20:54,408 --> 01:20:57,931
Simple, honest, little people who believe
in me. They say I've given them hope.

1109
01:20:58,008 --> 01:21:00,803
I'm not worrying about them.
They're gonna be all right.

1110
01:21:00,874 --> 01:21:03,362
But you won't.

1111
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,463
You've got to stop it. Do you hear?

1112
01:21:05,541 --> 01:21:08,472
You've got to, Stan, or I'll make you.

1113
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:12,164
I will walk out on you.

1114
01:21:13,273 --> 01:21:16,262
Are you crazy?

1115
01:21:16,339 --> 01:21:20,032
No, I'm not crazy. Just plain scared.

1116
01:21:20,106 --> 01:21:22,129
Scared? Of what?

1117
01:21:22,205 --> 01:21:25,262
I don't know. I can't explain it.

1118
01:21:25,338 --> 01:21:28,701
But I feel... Well, you're going against God.

1119
01:21:28,771 --> 01:21:31,760
<i>How do you figure that?</i>

1120
01:21:31,838 --> 01:21:33,861
Do you think I'd be
getting all those letters?

1121
01:21:33,938 --> 01:21:36,267
That's what makes it so terrible.

1122
01:21:36,337 --> 01:21:39,303
Everything you say and do
is so true and wonderful...

1123
01:21:39,371 --> 01:21:41,804
and you make it sound so sacred and holy...

1124
01:21:41,937 --> 01:21:44,334
<i>when all the time it's just a gag with you.</i>

1125
01:21:44,403 --> 01:21:47,130
<i>You'rejust laughing your
head off at those chumps.</i>

1126
01:21:47,203 --> 01:21:50,192
You think God's gonna stand for that?

1127
01:21:50,270 --> 01:21:52,292
Do you want him to strike you dead?

1128
01:21:52,369 --> 01:21:54,801
<i>You can't do it, Stan.</i>

1129
01:21:54,869 --> 01:21:57,959
Nobody's ever done it. Never!

1130
01:21:58,035 --> 01:22:00,933
Now, honey, don't get yourself
all worked up about nothing.

1131
01:22:01,002 --> 01:22:03,467
I've gone over this in
my mind a hundred times.

1132
01:22:03,535 --> 01:22:07,627
If anybody comes back, they're not gonna
get all steamed up because we fake a little.

1133
01:22:07,701 --> 01:22:12,190
Another thing. I've met a lot of these spook
workers. They're all hustlers just like me.

1134
01:22:12,268 --> 01:22:14,290
I didn't see one of them
wearing a lightning rod.

1135
01:22:14,367 --> 01:22:17,855
But they don't act like you do.
They don't talk like ministers.

1136
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:20,865
When did I ever talk like a minister?

1137
01:22:20,933 --> 01:22:23,455
Oh, you do it all the time.

1138
01:22:23,533 --> 01:22:26,658
I am talking exactly the same way
I did when we were in the nightclub.

1139
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:30,687
And I'll tell you another thing. I never
mentioned God in the nightclub, did I?

1140
01:22:30,765 --> 01:22:33,959
No. I-I don't think so.

1141
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:36,021
Have I ever mentioned him in this racket?

1142
01:22:36,098 --> 01:22:39,030
Have you ever heard me do it?
Come on, come on. When did I do it?

1143
01:22:39,098 --> 01:22:41,586
- You haven't, but...
- No, I'll say I haven't.

1144
01:22:41,664 --> 01:22:44,255
I know what I'm doing. I've read the Bible.

1145
01:22:44,330 --> 01:22:46,489
I can recite the Ten Commandments backwards.

1146
01:22:46,564 --> 01:22:49,086
And I'll tell you what the
Third Commandment is too:

1147
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:52,221
"Thou shalt not take the name
of the Lord, thy God, in vain".

1148
01:22:52,297 --> 01:22:55,922
A lot of people think that means
swearing. But I'll tell you what it means.

1149
01:22:55,997 --> 01:22:58,588
It means exactly what you're talking about.

1150
01:22:58,663 --> 01:23:02,151
I'm not taking any chances, baby.
There's nothing to worry about.

1151
01:23:02,229 --> 01:23:04,592
There's no difference
between this and mentalism.

1152
01:23:04,662 --> 01:23:06,685
It's just another angle of show business.

1153
01:23:06,762 --> 01:23:10,989
Wait a minute, mister. You're
not talking to one of your chumps.

1154
01:23:11,061 --> 01:23:15,755
You're talking to your wife. You're talking
to somebody who knows you red, white and blue.

1155
01:23:15,828 --> 01:23:17,851
And you can't fool me anymore.

1156
01:23:17,928 --> 01:23:21,257
There's only one way I can stop
you from doing this thing...

1157
01:23:21,327 --> 01:23:23,656
and that's to leave you.

1158
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,583
You'd honestly do a thing like that to me?

1159
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:31,819
<i>No. I'm going to do it for you.</i>

1160
01:23:31,893 --> 01:23:35,189
We're right back where we
started, hmm? All right.

1161
01:23:37,993 --> 01:23:41,856
Listen to me. I'm no good.

1162
01:23:41,925 --> 01:23:46,687
I never pretended to be. But I love you.

1163
01:23:46,758 --> 01:23:51,520
I'm a hustler. I've always
been one. But I love you.

1164
01:23:51,591 --> 01:23:55,250
I may be the thief of the world, but
with you I've always been on the level.

1165
01:24:01,090 --> 01:24:03,579
You've done a lot of talking about love.

1166
01:24:03,656 --> 01:24:06,781
I never mentioned it before...

1167
01:24:06,856 --> 01:24:09,253
but I guess you get the general idea.

1168
01:24:10,556 --> 01:24:13,613
If you wanna walk out on that...

1169
01:24:13,688 --> 01:24:15,745
it's okay with me.

1170
01:24:25,188 --> 01:24:27,177
Here we are.

1171
01:24:34,254 --> 01:24:36,446
Mr. Grindle, this... this place of yours...

1172
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:39,179
is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen.

1173
01:24:39,253 --> 01:24:42,651
- You should be very proud of it.
- Yes, I am.

1174
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:46,981
Those great trees in moonlight,
they give the whole place a...

1175
01:24:47,052 --> 01:24:49,143
a cathedral-like atmosphere.

1176
01:24:49,218 --> 01:24:51,878
- You feel that?
- Yes.

1177
01:24:51,951 --> 01:24:54,746
I'm glad to hear you say that.

1178
01:24:54,818 --> 01:24:58,648
I've been coming here to
pray. It's so secluded.

1179
01:24:58,718 --> 01:25:01,707
I didn't want any of the servants to see me.

1180
01:25:01,785 --> 01:25:04,478
I see you've been reading the Bible.

1181
01:25:04,551 --> 01:25:07,482
How did you know?

1182
01:25:07,550 --> 01:25:11,175
Well, we... we know that it tells us...

1183
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:14,512
that prayer, like good works,
should be done in secret.

1184
01:25:16,916 --> 01:25:21,008
<i>- There's one thing that troubles me.
- What's that?</i>

1185
01:25:21,083 --> 01:25:24,742
Well, on account of the life I've led...

1186
01:25:24,815 --> 01:25:28,077
I don't know very much about God.

1187
01:25:28,149 --> 01:25:30,273
And it's very hard to pray to someone...

1188
01:25:30,348 --> 01:25:33,939
I mean, when you know so little about him.

1189
01:25:34,014 --> 01:25:38,310
Well, that's true. But nobody
knows very much along those lines.

1190
01:25:38,381 --> 01:25:41,278
That's where we must rely
solely upon our faith.

1191
01:25:41,347 --> 01:25:43,745
Indeed, I think it's a mistake...

1192
01:25:43,814 --> 01:25:47,677
to try to define our thoughts
about it in human terms.

1193
01:25:47,746 --> 01:25:50,678
That, in itself, is a form of irreverence.

1194
01:25:50,746 --> 01:25:53,712
It's like... like trying to
put the ocean into bottles.

1195
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:58,007
That's right. That's where I've been wrong.

1196
01:25:58,079 --> 01:26:00,476
Trying to put boundaries around this thing.

1197
01:26:00,545 --> 01:26:04,568
It's too big. It has no
boundaries. No limits.

1198
01:26:04,645 --> 01:26:07,804
It can't have, can it? And be what it is.

1199
01:26:09,078 --> 01:26:12,510
Go on. Go on, my friend.

1200
01:26:12,577 --> 01:26:15,668
You don't know it, but you're
praying right this moment.

1201
01:26:25,309 --> 01:26:29,105
No prophet of old could have said a
finer thing than you have just said.

1202
01:26:29,176 --> 01:26:31,165
Keep it up.

1203
01:26:31,243 --> 01:26:34,504
Think like that in your heart.
Don't worry about the words.

1204
01:26:34,575 --> 01:26:38,063
There are no words for it.
Words are boundaries too.

1205
01:26:38,142 --> 01:26:40,131
But they're not any bigger than we are.

1206
01:26:40,208 --> 01:26:43,571
You've got to do things, just
as you said the other day.

1207
01:26:43,641 --> 01:26:45,800
"Good things, good for their own sake...

1208
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:48,999
without any hope of reward or... "

1209
01:26:53,007 --> 01:26:55,404
- What's the matter?
- Look!

1210
01:26:57,673 --> 01:27:00,434
- Do you see it?
- Yes.

1211
01:27:00,507 --> 01:27:02,495
Probably one of your servants.

1212
01:27:02,572 --> 01:27:07,902
No, no, it couldn't be. They have
orders never to come down here.

1213
01:27:19,971 --> 01:27:21,960
Dory?

1214
01:27:23,004 --> 01:27:25,629
<i>It is.</i>

1215
01:27:25,704 --> 01:27:28,431
It is.

1216
01:27:38,069 --> 01:27:41,502
Dory! Dory!

1217
01:27:41,569 --> 01:27:43,830
- Wait!
- Dory!

1218
01:27:43,902 --> 01:27:46,061
- But it's Dory. Don't you see?
- Yes.

1219
01:27:46,136 --> 01:27:49,897
That means we're on hallowed ground. Kneel.

1220
01:27:49,968 --> 01:27:51,957
Kneel.

1221
01:28:04,867 --> 01:28:06,890
Dory! Dory!

1222
01:28:06,967 --> 01:28:10,194
Quiet. Don't move. Stay where you are.

1223
01:28:26,364 --> 01:28:28,557
Dory. Dory.

1224
01:28:32,697 --> 01:28:35,663
Oh, Dory, forgive me. Forgive me, Dory.

1225
01:28:35,730 --> 01:28:39,423
<i>I believe now. I believe everything.</i>

1226
01:28:39,497 --> 01:28:41,962
Oh, Dory, ask God to forgive me.

1227
01:28:42,029 --> 01:28:45,927
Ask him to give me one
more chance. Please. Please!

1228
01:28:45,996 --> 01:28:48,928
<i>I'll do anything.</i>

1229
01:28:48,996 --> 01:28:51,325
<i>What right have I to ask for mercy...</i>

1230
01:28:51,395 --> 01:28:54,952
when I have never shown mercy to anyone?

1231
01:28:55,028 --> 01:28:57,516
No! No!

1232
01:28:57,595 --> 01:28:59,823
- I can't, Stan! I can't!
- What happened to you?

1233
01:28:59,895 --> 01:29:02,656
- Not even for you.
- Who are you?

1234
01:29:02,728 --> 01:29:05,784
- I'm Stan's wife.
- Get out of here! Get out of here!

1235
01:29:07,393 --> 01:29:10,416
Fake! You crook! You
dirty, sacrilegious thief!

1236
01:29:10,494 --> 01:29:13,324
Help! Help!

1237
01:29:24,959 --> 01:29:27,424
I couldn't help it, Stan.

1238
01:29:27,492 --> 01:29:29,822
I know I've ruined everything for you.

1239
01:29:29,892 --> 01:29:32,289
- I know you hate me.
- All right, all right, quiet.

1240
01:29:32,358 --> 01:29:35,552
I don't know what happened.

1241
01:29:35,624 --> 01:29:39,818
When I saw that man down on
his knees, praying to God...

1242
01:29:39,891 --> 01:29:42,152
I just couldn't go on.

1243
01:29:42,224 --> 01:29:45,213
I don't wanna hear any more about it.

1244
01:29:45,290 --> 01:29:47,415
As soon as I find a taxi
stand, I'm getting out of here.

1245
01:29:47,490 --> 01:29:49,285
What for?

1246
01:29:49,356 --> 01:29:52,151
There's something I've gotta do.

1247
01:29:52,223 --> 01:29:55,121
Now listen, I want you to
go back to that motel...

1248
01:29:55,189 --> 01:29:57,984
change your clothes and meet
me at the Inglewood Station.

1249
01:29:58,056 --> 01:30:00,544
- You're going to take me with you?
- If you hurry.

1250
01:30:00,622 --> 01:30:02,611
What about our things at the hotel?

1251
01:30:02,689 --> 01:30:04,746
We haven't got time to
monkey with things like that.

1252
01:30:04,821 --> 01:30:07,379
Oh, Stan, I love you. I love you.

1253
01:30:07,455 --> 01:30:10,545
Yeah, I know. Here we are.

1254
01:30:12,554 --> 01:30:15,213
There he was on his knees, I had
all that dough right in my hand...

1255
01:30:15,287 --> 01:30:17,718
- and she has to go and blow her top.
- Then what happened?

1256
01:30:17,787 --> 01:30:20,412
Well, he called me a dirty,
sacrilegious thief, and he grabbed me.

1257
01:30:20,487 --> 01:30:22,715
I hurt him, I think, accidentally.

1258
01:30:22,787 --> 01:30:25,218
- You think?
- Well, anyway, he went down.

1259
01:30:25,286 --> 01:30:27,445
<i>You better get going.</i>

1260
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:30,508
- Yeah, yeah, I know.
- You'd better take your money with you.

1261
01:30:51,784 --> 01:30:54,147
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to leave most of this with you.

1262
01:30:54,217 --> 01:30:56,910
- What for?
- In case I get caught, I'll have some fall money.

1263
01:30:56,983 --> 01:31:00,416
That wouldn't be any good. You'd just lead
them straight back to me and pull us both in.

1264
01:31:00,483 --> 01:31:03,916
Yeah, you're right. You suppose
there's a chance of handling Grindle?

1265
01:31:03,983 --> 01:31:07,415
Well, it depends. He's not going to be easy.

1266
01:31:07,483 --> 01:31:10,573
- He has his pride, you know.
- Yes, but you can work on the publicity angle.

1267
01:31:10,648 --> 01:31:13,046
- His board of directors and so forth.
- You leave that up to me.

1268
01:31:13,116 --> 01:31:15,104
The important thing for you is to leave town.

1269
01:31:15,181 --> 01:31:17,613
Don't try to get in touch with
me under any circumstances.

1270
01:31:17,682 --> 01:31:20,704
Watch the papers. If nothing
happens, you can call me.

1271
01:31:20,781 --> 01:31:23,906
Okay. What a mug I've been.

1272
01:31:23,981 --> 01:31:26,606
I had the whole world right in my
vest pocket. Everything I wanted.

1273
01:31:26,681 --> 01:31:29,374
The kid said I couldn't get away with
it, and I had to stick my chin out.

1274
01:31:29,447 --> 01:31:32,378
You'll stick it out even further
if you hang around here much longer.

1275
01:31:32,446 --> 01:31:34,639
I guess you're right at that.

1276
01:31:36,747 --> 01:31:39,712
- Good-bye, Stan.
- Good-bye, Lilith.

1277
01:31:58,311 --> 01:32:00,742
Say, buddy, how much
longer is it gonna take us?

1278
01:32:00,810 --> 01:32:04,106
Inglewood Station? About a half hour.

1279
01:32:04,177 --> 01:32:07,006
- Can't you step on it a little bit?
- Sure.

1280
01:32:34,506 --> 01:32:36,529
<i>- Take me back where you picked me up.
- What?</i>

1281
01:32:36,606 --> 01:32:39,299
<i>- I said take me back where you picked me up.
- Okay.</i>

1282
01:32:51,004 --> 01:32:53,936
<i>Who is it?</i>

1283
01:32:56,038 --> 01:32:58,629
You're good. You're awful good.

1284
01:32:58,704 --> 01:33:01,135
Just about the best I ever saw.

1285
01:33:01,204 --> 01:33:05,364
Instead of 150 grand, I get
150 brand-new one dollar bills.

1286
01:33:05,436 --> 01:33:07,527
- The gypsy switch.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1287
01:33:07,603 --> 01:33:09,592
- Where's the rest of it?
- The rest of what?

1288
01:33:09,670 --> 01:33:12,363
<i>- Open that safe.
- Miss Ritter.! Miss Ritter.!</i>

1289
01:33:12,436 --> 01:33:14,425
<i>Come in, Jane.</i>

1290
01:33:14,502 --> 01:33:16,900
I saw a man on the fire escape, and I...

1291
01:33:16,969 --> 01:33:19,867
It's quite all right, Jane. This
gentleman's a patient of mine.

1292
01:33:19,936 --> 01:33:23,026
Will you make yourself comfortable in
there, please? I'll be with you in a minute.

1293
01:34:03,331 --> 01:34:06,297
When you first came to
me, you were in bad shape.

1294
01:34:06,364 --> 01:34:10,523
I had hoped by getting at the roots of your
anxieties, I could avert a serious upset.

1295
01:34:10,597 --> 01:34:12,586
Well, I seemed to have failed.

1296
01:34:15,097 --> 01:34:18,529
Wait a minute. If you're thinking
of throwing the cops at me...

1297
01:34:18,596 --> 01:34:20,585
don't forget that you've
been in this with me.

1298
01:34:20,663 --> 01:34:23,424
Please, Mr. Carlisle, try to understand...

1299
01:34:23,496 --> 01:34:27,326
that these delusions of yours in regard
to me are a part of your mental condition.

1300
01:34:27,396 --> 01:34:31,885
<i>When I first examined you, you were
being tortured by guilt reactions...</i>

1301
01:34:31,962 --> 01:34:36,360
<i>connected with the death of that drunken
mentalist during your carnival days.</i>

1302
01:34:36,428 --> 01:34:40,587
Wh-What are you trying to
pull? You can't prove anything.

1303
01:34:40,661 --> 01:34:42,889
Besides, it was an accident. I told you that.

1304
01:34:42,961 --> 01:34:45,755
I'm a psychologist, not a judge.

1305
01:34:45,827 --> 01:34:48,055
What I want to explain to you is...

1306
01:34:48,127 --> 01:34:52,456
all these things that you think you have
done lately, or that have been done to you...

1307
01:34:52,526 --> 01:34:57,220
are merely the fancied guilt of your
past life projected on the present.

1308
01:34:57,293 --> 01:35:01,918
Do I make myself clear? You must
regard it all as a nightmare.

1309
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:07,851
The police records show that a carnival
employee by the name of Peter Krumbein...

1310
01:35:07,925 --> 01:35:11,618
actually died of wood alcohol
poisoning in Burly, Texas.

1311
01:35:11,691 --> 01:35:16,918
Self-administered. You told me you gave
him that bottle of wood alcohol yourself.

1312
01:35:16,990 --> 01:35:22,354
But I suppose that was just another one of
your homicidal hallucinations, wasn't it?

1313
01:35:22,423 --> 01:35:24,719
Or was the homicide a reality too?

1314
01:35:29,457 --> 01:35:32,218
Speaking of records, would
you like to hear a playback...

1315
01:35:32,289 --> 01:35:34,847
of the recital you made to me that night?

1316
01:35:34,923 --> 01:35:40,048
It's on file in my office, but I'll be
glad to let you hear it anytime you like.

1317
01:35:40,122 --> 01:35:43,554
Listen. I can prove that you've
been in this with me from the start.

1318
01:35:43,621 --> 01:35:45,610
That's another thing, Mr. Carlisle...

1319
01:35:45,688 --> 01:35:48,518
which clearly indicates the
serious nature of your malady.

1320
01:35:48,588 --> 01:35:51,747
Since I've been your counselor, you've
made a strange transference to me.

1321
01:35:51,821 --> 01:35:53,844
You see me as a confederate
who's cheated you.

1322
01:35:53,921 --> 01:35:57,080
That explains your entrance by
way of the fire escape tonight.

1323
01:35:57,153 --> 01:35:59,517
Really, Mr. Carlisle, I
hate to say this to you...

1324
01:35:59,586 --> 01:36:01,575
but you simply must have hospital care.

1325
01:36:01,653 --> 01:36:04,017
These hallucinations of yours.

1326
01:36:04,087 --> 01:36:07,644
We can't have you wandering about,
getting into trouble, can we?

1327
01:36:09,652 --> 01:36:13,846
Listen, you can't bluff me with
that doctor-patient baloney.

1328
01:36:13,919 --> 01:36:16,783
<i>I want that dough. I want that...</i>

1329
01:36:24,250 --> 01:36:26,580
That's why you were stalling, huh?

1330
01:36:26,651 --> 01:36:28,775
Waiting for the cops.

1331
01:36:33,516 --> 01:36:37,004
That's ridiculous. Why
should I call the police?

1332
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:40,516
Don't you think I got ears? What about that?

1333
01:36:40,583 --> 01:36:43,377
- What about what?
- That police siren.

1334
01:36:48,082 --> 01:36:50,412
I don't hear anything.

1335
01:36:55,981 --> 01:36:58,105
- Huh?
- Let me get you a sedative.

1336
01:36:58,181 --> 01:37:00,703
I'll drive you down to SaintJoseph's
Hospital. It's not far from here.

1337
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:04,610
They'll take good care of you,
and you can have a nice, long rest.

1338
01:37:07,180 --> 01:37:09,578
Please, Mr. Carlisle,
put yourself in my hands.

1339
01:37:09,647 --> 01:37:13,079
<i>You can trust me, absolutely.</i>

1340
01:37:13,146 --> 01:37:15,135
No.

1341
01:37:34,510 --> 01:37:38,034
Stan, where have you been?
I've been waiting for hours...

1342
01:37:38,110 --> 01:37:41,440
walking up and down the platform,
looking all over for you.

1343
01:37:41,510 --> 01:37:44,498
- Huh?
- What's the matter, darling?

1344
01:37:44,576 --> 01:37:47,599
What's happened to you?

1345
01:37:47,676 --> 01:37:50,233
A lot of things, baby.

1346
01:37:50,309 --> 01:37:52,298
A lot of things.

1347
01:37:59,608 --> 01:38:03,664
Zeena wasn't so far off after all.

1348
01:38:03,741 --> 01:38:07,174
- Zeena and her
boob-catchers. - Zeena?

1349
01:38:07,241 --> 01:38:09,229
Where's the carnival
playing now? Do you know?

1350
01:38:09,307 --> 01:38:11,773
Galesburg, I think. But why?

1351
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:15,533
- You could go there by bus.
- But, Stan...

1352
01:38:15,606 --> 01:38:19,436
Yeah. Yeah, that's the best idea.

1353
01:38:19,506 --> 01:38:22,597
What about you? Where are you going?

1354
01:38:22,673 --> 01:38:24,695
I don't know.

1355
01:38:24,772 --> 01:38:29,170
Oh, but, Stan, I thought
I was going with you.

1356
01:38:29,238 --> 01:38:31,329
So did I.

1357
01:38:31,405 --> 01:38:34,030
What's happened? You've got to tell me.

1358
01:38:34,105 --> 01:38:36,730
<i>All aboard.!</i>

1359
01:38:36,805 --> 01:38:39,600
Listen, baby. I want
you to get on that train.

1360
01:38:39,671 --> 01:38:42,535
Go anywhere, then get back to Galesburg.

1361
01:38:42,604 --> 01:38:45,468
Keep out of sight as much as possible.

1362
01:38:56,903 --> 01:38:59,233
Here.

1363
01:38:59,302 --> 01:39:01,393
Here's the bankroll. Take good care of it.

1364
01:39:01,469 --> 01:39:03,492
But what about you? Won't you need some?

1365
01:39:03,569 --> 01:39:06,864
No, I'll be all right. So long, honey.

1366
01:39:09,802 --> 01:39:12,825
<i>All aboard.!</i>

1367
01:39:12,902 --> 01:39:15,595
Get aboard, honey. Don't miss the train.

1368
01:39:15,668 --> 01:39:17,656
Stan!

1369
01:39:22,068 --> 01:39:24,158
Take care of yourself.

1370
01:40:04,563 --> 01:40:07,222
<i>Who is it?</i>

1371
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:09,659
<i>Joe. Bellboy.</i>

1372
01:40:14,095 --> 01:40:16,584
- Pick up the tray.
- Come in.

1373
01:40:20,228 --> 01:40:23,523
- Something wrong?
- What do you mean "something wrong"?

1374
01:40:23,594 --> 01:40:26,116
- The food... you haven't touched it.
- Well, I'm not hungry.

1375
01:40:28,561 --> 01:40:30,992
Hey, uh, look, mister, it
ain't none of my business...

1376
01:40:31,061 --> 01:40:33,186
but we got a pretty good
doctor down the street there.

1377
01:40:33,260 --> 01:40:37,090
- You want me to call him?
- What makes you think I want a doctor?

1378
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:39,887
Nothing. Only, you haven't touched a
mouthful in about three days. I just...

1379
01:40:39,959 --> 01:40:42,652
Well, I don't want a
doctor and I'm all right.

1380
01:40:45,826 --> 01:40:49,189
Say, uh, you know where I can get a drink?

1381
01:40:49,259 --> 01:40:53,384
No, not at this hour in this
state, unless you want gin.

1382
01:40:53,458 --> 01:40:56,481
Sure, sure. Anything. Anything.

1383
01:40:56,558 --> 01:40:58,547
Two bucks.

1384
01:41:08,490 --> 01:41:11,546
- If there's anything else you want...
- No. Good night.

1385
01:41:43,586 --> 01:41:47,541
Since the dawn of history, man has
sought to see behind the veil...

1386
01:41:47,620 --> 01:41:50,245
which hides him from tomorrow.

1387
01:41:50,319 --> 01:41:54,717
Through the ages, certain men have
gazed into the polished crystal...

1388
01:41:54,786 --> 01:41:57,547
and seen.

1389
01:41:57,619 --> 01:42:00,914
Is it some quality of the crystal itself...

1390
01:42:00,985 --> 01:42:05,440
or does it merely serve to
turn the gazer's vision inward?

1391
01:42:05,518 --> 01:42:08,382
Who can tell?

1392
01:42:08,451 --> 01:42:13,179
But visions come, slowly shifting their form.

1393
01:42:13,251 --> 01:42:17,013
Visions come. Wait.

1394
01:42:18,750 --> 01:42:21,215
The shifting shapes begin to clear.

1395
01:42:22,883 --> 01:42:25,508
I see fields of grass...

1396
01:42:25,582 --> 01:42:29,412
and rolling hills and a boy.

1397
01:42:29,482 --> 01:42:33,141
A barefoot boy is running
through those hills.

1398
01:42:33,215 --> 01:42:36,647
A dog is with him. A dog is with him.

1399
01:42:36,715 --> 01:42:41,048
Yeah, his name is Don. Go on.

1400
01:42:41,214 --> 01:42:45,976
Your mother. Your mother is
waiting at the gate for you.

1401
01:42:46,048 --> 01:42:48,037
A beautiful, gray-haired old lady.

1402
01:42:48,114 --> 01:42:51,739
That's right, buddy. You're pretty good.

1403
01:42:51,814 --> 01:42:54,211
She was always standing there waiting.

1404
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:56,677
Even when I come home a couple of years ago.

1405
01:43:00,946 --> 01:43:03,036
Hey, you see how easy it is to hook 'em?

1406
01:43:03,112 --> 01:43:06,908
Stock reading, fits anybody. Never misses.

1407
01:43:06,979 --> 01:43:09,206
Ah, what's youth?

1408
01:43:09,278 --> 01:43:12,835
Happy one minute, hungry
and heartbroken the next.

1409
01:43:12,911 --> 01:43:15,400
Every boy has a dog.

1410
01:43:15,478 --> 01:43:19,739
Every boy has a beautiful,
old, gray-haired mother.

1411
01:43:19,811 --> 01:43:22,368
<i>- Everybody except maybe me.
- What happened to her?</i>

1412
01:43:22,444 --> 01:43:25,876
- Oh, what do you care?
- Hey, don't cry in that good liquor.

1413
01:43:29,943 --> 01:43:32,500
You know, I had a mother once.

1414
01:43:32,576 --> 01:43:36,303
She wasn't so good-looking,
but she was mighty good to me.

1415
01:43:36,376 --> 01:43:40,069
Hey, hey, you fellas take it easy.
There's not gonna be any left for me.

1416
01:43:40,143 --> 01:43:42,199
Buddy, you're sure a good mind reader.

1417
01:44:28,570 --> 01:44:31,695
Oh, excuse me, mister. Are you the boss?

1418
01:44:31,771 --> 01:44:34,566
That's right. What do you want?

1419
01:44:34,637 --> 01:44:40,069
1l
- I, uh... I wanted to talk to you about an attraction.

1420
01:44:40,137 --> 01:44:44,762
An added attraction, so to speak.
It's, uh, an attraction that...

1421
01:44:46,536 --> 01:44:50,558
- An attraction.
- Yeah? What kind of an attraction?

1422
01:44:50,635 --> 01:44:53,533
- Come on. Hurry up. I'm busy.
- Well...

1423
01:44:53,602 --> 01:44:56,227
Of course, I understand,
a man in your position.

1424
01:44:56,301 --> 01:44:59,698
Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm... I'm Sheik Abracadabra.

1425
01:44:59,768 --> 01:45:01,859
A top-money mint reader.

1426
01:45:01,934 --> 01:45:04,195
Sorry, brother. I'm all full up.

1427
01:45:04,267 --> 01:45:09,359
- Anyway, I don't hire no boozers.
- Me?

1428
01:45:09,434 --> 01:45:12,399
You smell like you just
climbed out of a beer vat.

1429
01:45:13,466 --> 01:45:15,489
- Go on, beat it.
- Um...

1430
01:45:15,566 --> 01:45:17,555
Please, j-just give me a chance, mister.

1431
01:45:17,633 --> 01:45:21,030
I'm an old carny hand
and I'll tackle anything.

1432
01:45:24,232 --> 01:45:26,790
Come here.

1433
01:45:26,866 --> 01:45:28,854
Sit down.

1434
01:45:36,297 --> 01:45:38,320
Would you like a snort?

1435
01:45:38,398 --> 01:45:40,387
Oh, y...

1436
01:45:53,863 --> 01:45:55,954
Oh, that's very refreshing.

1437
01:45:56,030 --> 01:45:58,893
Thank you, sir.

1438
01:45:58,962 --> 01:46:01,792
All I need is a fly and a bridge table.

1439
01:46:01,862 --> 01:46:04,384
I can hang my banner on the edge of the fly.

1440
01:46:04,461 --> 01:46:06,984
If I could have a small advance
to purchase the necessary...

1441
01:46:07,061 --> 01:46:09,289
That show is too high class for a mid-camp.

1442
01:46:09,361 --> 01:46:12,690
Besides, palmistry always gets
you in trouble with the law.

1443
01:46:12,761 --> 01:46:14,852
Well, I'm pretty good at magic too, sir. I...

1444
01:46:14,927 --> 01:46:18,484
Magicians are a dime a dozen nowadays.

1445
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:22,014
- Would you like another?
- Yeah.

1446
01:46:22,093 --> 01:46:24,082
Go ahead.

1447
01:46:27,459 --> 01:46:30,947
Anyway, I never fool with an act,
unless it's got something sensational.

1448
01:46:32,059 --> 01:46:35,048
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

1449
01:46:35,126 --> 01:46:37,887
- Wait.
- Yeah.

1450
01:46:37,959 --> 01:46:40,117
I just happened to think of something.

1451
01:46:40,191 --> 01:46:42,816
I might have a job you can take a crack at.

1452
01:46:42,891 --> 01:46:48,051
Course, it isn't much, and I'm not
begging you to take it, but it's a job.

1453
01:46:48,124 --> 01:46:50,147
Yeah, well, that's all I want.

1454
01:46:50,224 --> 01:46:52,213
And we'll keep you in coffee and cakes.

1455
01:46:52,290 --> 01:46:55,449
Bottle every day. Place to sleep it off in.

1456
01:46:55,523 --> 01:46:59,182
What do you say? Anyway, it's only temporary.

1457
01:46:59,256 --> 01:47:02,120
Just until we can get a real geek.

1458
01:47:05,689 --> 01:47:09,553
- Geek?
- You know what a geek is, don't you?

1459
01:47:11,455 --> 01:47:13,852
Yeah.

1460
01:47:13,921 --> 01:47:16,682
Sure, I-I know what a geek is.

1461
01:47:16,755 --> 01:47:18,846
Do you think you can handle it?

1462
01:47:20,388 --> 01:47:22,684
Mister...

1463
01:47:22,754 --> 01:47:24,913
I was made for it.

1464
01:47:36,086 --> 01:47:38,109
Jimmy!

1465
01:47:38,186 --> 01:47:40,651
Hey, Jimmy!

1466
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:44,515
- Jimmy!
- What's wrong, Ed?

1467
01:47:44,586 --> 01:47:47,676
- Have you seen the handcuff key?
- No.

1468
01:47:47,752 --> 01:47:49,843
Come on. Come on. Where's the straitjacket?

1469
01:47:49,918 --> 01:47:51,940
- Who wants it?
- The boss.

1470
01:47:52,018 --> 01:47:54,314
- Is anything wrong?
- The geek's gone nuts.

1471
01:47:54,385 --> 01:47:56,374
- The geek?
- The one McGraw hired today.

1472
01:48:00,051 --> 01:48:04,005
<i>Grab him, boys.!</i>

1473
01:48:04,083 --> 01:48:06,106
You better get inside and stay there.

1474
01:48:06,183 --> 01:48:08,614
Let's get him!

1475
01:48:16,949 --> 01:48:20,278
Watch him now. Don't hurt him.

1476
01:48:20,348 --> 01:48:24,371
<i>Where... Where did he go? Huh?</i>

1477
01:48:33,481 --> 01:48:36,708
Stan. Stan.

1478
01:48:36,780 --> 01:48:38,871
Son, nobody's gonna hurt you.

1479
01:48:38,947 --> 01:48:43,004
Come on! Hey, George!

1480
01:49:25,676 --> 01:49:28,835
- Mark, you go around the back.
- Okay, Charlie.

1481
01:49:28,908 --> 01:49:30,999
- Stan!
- Hey, look out, kid.

1482
01:49:31,075 --> 01:49:33,267
- That guy's liable to kill somebody.
- Stan!

1483
01:49:33,341 --> 01:49:36,034
It's me, Molly!

1484
01:49:42,741 --> 01:49:44,673
Stan.

1485
01:49:44,741 --> 01:49:48,366
<i>It's me, Molly.</i>

1486
01:49:48,440 --> 01:49:52,428
I've looked everywhere for you. Everywhere.

1487
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:58,828
I've been waiting for you.

1488
01:50:08,005 --> 01:50:11,630
Don't you know me, honey? It's me, Molly.

1489
01:50:11,704 --> 01:50:15,727
Everything's gonna be all
right now. I'll look after you.

1490
01:50:34,869 --> 01:50:37,232
Molly?

1491
01:50:44,401 --> 01:50:48,561
Well, he certainly fooled
me. I never recognized him.
