00:11:46,903 --> 00:11:49,940
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right, you say you got speed?
What kind of speed?</font>

116
00:11:50,073 --> 00:11:53,857
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I got crystal Methedrine.
This shit is good, man.</font>

sit back and watch a little TV?</font>

122
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,260
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right.</font>

You know how ringy it makes you.</font>

tonight? It's Saturday night, right?</font>

126
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:40,869
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let's get some speed. We'll fix up,
then we'll go hit that big fat pharmacy.</font>

00:12:44,206 --> 00:12:47,409
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Baby, you know how these things go.
It's like a crap game.</font>

129
00:12:47,543 --> 00:12:51,920
<font face="Trebuchet MS">When you're hot, you shoot the works.
When you're cold, you lay off a bit.</font>

130
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:55,250
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, right now, baby,
I'm so hot, I'm burnin' up all over.</font>

131
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:56,961
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right, buster.</font>

132
00:12:57,093 --> 00:13:01,589
<font face="Trebuchet MS">If you're so damn hot, why don't you lay
me down right now and make love to me?</font>

133
00:13:01,722 --> 00:13:05,850
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Come on. You know what I mean.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.</font>

134
00:13:06,435 --> 00:13:08,890
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>So, did you watch I Spy last night?</i></font>

135
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:11,686
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>No, I watched Outer Limits.</i></font>

136
00:13:12,107 --> 00:13:16,650
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm hot to steal. Shoot,
we could do that any time. Come on.</font>

137
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,365
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Besides, we got company.</font>

138
00:13:23,326 --> 00:13:26,196
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So, do you think you could get me a TV?</font>

139
00:13:26,328 --> 00:13:28,202
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Yeah, I could.
- Colour?</font>

140
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,117
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Yeah, but what could
you do for me, man?</i></font>

141
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,665
<font face="Trebuchet MS">How about some Valium, man?
You look like you could use it.</font>

142
00:13:34,794 --> 00:13:37,499
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Ten milligrams. 60 Valium.
- That's cool.</font>

143
00:13:38,047 --> 00:13:40,087
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, listen.</font>

144
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:43,924
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't tell Bob.</font>

145
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:46,722
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I won't tell Bob. Fuck that guy.</font>

146
00:13:48,474 --> 00:13:50,680
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, twerpy. We're gonna fix you up now.</font>

147
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:52,636
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You guys got any blues?</font>

148
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:58,012
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Blues? Me? Hell, no. You know how hard
it is to get blues these days, David.</font>

149
00:13:58,858 --> 00:14:01,479
<font face="Trebuchet MS">How about some morphine?
I got good old morphine.</font>

150
00:14:01,611 --> 00:14:03,899
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What'd you get, man?
Morphine sulphate?</font>

151
00:14:04,197 --> 00:14:08,574
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're crazy, man, cos I can't even
read a stop sign when I'm on that crap.</font>

152
00:14:08,701 --> 00:14:11,370
<font face="Trebuchet MS">My eyes get so far out of focus.</font>

153
00:14:11,787 --> 00:14:15,701
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Besides, I'm not trading no uptown
crank for no downtown trash.</font>

154
00:14:15,832 --> 00:14:19,699
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What can I say? That's all
I got. That's all I can give.</font>

155
00:14:22,213 --> 00:14:24,253
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's bullshit, man.</font>

156
00:14:25,258 --> 00:14:28,792
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You guys think I'm dumb.
I'm not as dumb as you think I am.</font>

157
00:14:30,471 --> 00:14:33,970
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, David? Too bad
we couldn't do business, pal.</font>

158
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,845
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right, man. Fuck. I'm sorry, OK?</font>

159
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:44,641
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- I didn't mean any of that.
- It's OK. It's all right.</font>

160
00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:49,484
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So how many quarter grains of that
morphine are you gonna give me for this?</font>

161
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:54,735
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll hit you with nine quarters per package,
and that's just cos I'm feeling good.</font>

162
00:14:54,952 --> 00:14:59,329
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And because you're a real stand-up dude,
I'll take all ten grams from you.</font>

163
00:14:59,456 --> 00:15:03,833
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ten grams? All right. That's nine
apiece. Nine times ten is, uh...</font>

164
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,419
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's, uh, 75.</font>

165
00:15:05,586 --> 00:15:06,997
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, 75. Right.</font>

166
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,336
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's 90, Bob.</font>

167
00:15:10,216 --> 00:15:12,255
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, Bob. That's 90.</font>

168
00:15:24,312 --> 00:15:28,060
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, Bob, how much do you want
for her? How much of this for her?</font>

169
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:29,056
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Huh?</font>

170
00:15:29,192 --> 00:15:32,358
<font face="Trebuchet MS">How much of this do you want
for the foxy female?</font>

171
00:15:32,486 --> 00:15:36,531
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey. What do you think I am?
Some kind of closet pimp?</font>

172
00:15:37,324 --> 00:15:41,701
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I've never heard of such a violation
of woman's rights in all my life.</font>

173
00:15:44,706 --> 00:15:49,166
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just out of curiosity, how many bags
of speed would you give me for this girl?</font>

174
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:50,669
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I, uh... I don't know.</font>

175
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:53,464
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You twerp! You touch me and
I'll knock your block off.</font>

176
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:54,787
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She's mean, man.</font>

177
00:15:54,924 --> 00:15:58,968
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right, all right.
Let's finish this deal.</font>

178
00:15:59,136 --> 00:16:01,424
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Sorry.
- Pick up your stuff, David, and go.</font>

179
00:16:01,555 --> 00:16:03,298
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We've got some things to do.</font>

180
00:16:03,431 --> 00:16:05,590
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right. Sorry, Dianne. Here, Bob.</font>

181
00:16:05,725 --> 00:16:07,599
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah.</font>

182
00:16:07,727 --> 00:16:10,099
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- All right, man.
- All right. Thanks.</font>

183
00:16:12,106 --> 00:16:14,775
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right. You guys have a good evening.</font>

184
00:16:17,361 --> 00:16:21,405
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Next time you step in the middle of one of
my deals to help me with my arithmetic,</font>

185
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:26,774
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll sell you to the first one-eyed carnival
freak I find for a pack of chewing gum.</font>

186
00:16:29,706 --> 00:16:31,615
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Look at me, babe. I'm hysterical.</font>

187
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,832
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Sorry, Bob.</font>

188
00:16:38,505 --> 00:16:44,211
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just try to remember. Was it
a round collar, a scoop neck, or what?</font>

189
00:16:44,886 --> 00:16:47,093
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It was a blouse. A blouse.</font>

190
00:16:47,222 --> 00:16:49,095
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Um...</font>

191
00:16:49,224 --> 00:16:51,679
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I really don't remember.</font>

192
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:39,143
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Dianne, are you
goin' crazy or something?</font>

193
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:44,935
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Dianne, what the fuck are you doin'?</font>

194
00:17:45,776 --> 00:17:50,733
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What are you on? Glue or something?
Dianne, look. We ought to be out workin'.</font>

195
00:17:50,864 --> 00:17:55,110
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>I know this hospital on the coast.
I know it's a virgin. I know it is.</i></font>

196
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:59,119
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I mean, this place has got security zero.</font>

197
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:05,369
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I bet they got coke, mammy. All those
hospitals, they always hold big-time coke.</font>

198
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:10,665
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're crazy, Bob. We just pulled off
the best score we make in months</font>

199
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,290
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and off you trot looking for more.</font>

200
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,917
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Man, you don't know
when to take a break.</font>

201
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:18,096
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Come on, Bob.</font>

202
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:24,393
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know me. I can't stand
to go on for ever like this.</font>

203
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:29,516
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Come on. Why don't you take me in the
bedroom and just hold me for a while?</font>

204
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,938
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What do you want me to hold you for?
Look, Dianne, we ought to be out crackin'.</font>

205
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,395
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- I thought you loved me.
- Why don't we just...</font>

206
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:39,282
<font face="Trebuchet MS">But you won't fuck me
and I always have to drive.</font>

207
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:43,572
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Look, why don't we just, uh, uh,
head up to that hospital right now</font>

208
00:18:44,246 --> 00:18:47,117
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and see if we can make it there
before it gets daylight?</font>

209
00:18:47,249 --> 00:18:52,290
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I mean, babe, you're just gonna
flip out when you see this one, man.</font>

210
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,378
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I mean...</font>

211
00:18:57,675 --> 00:19:02,918
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I can just see all those bottles of pills
that hospital's holding for me right now.</font>

212
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,139
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Up against the wall!</font>

213
00:19:11,271 --> 00:19:14,391
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Up against the wall.
- Don't give me any shit. Shut up.</font>

214
00:19:16,818 --> 00:19:19,273
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Check the other room.</font>

215
00:19:20,613 --> 00:19:22,404
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right, you two. Turn around.</font>

216
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:28,078
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I said the other day "Bob's slowed down."
Then you knock off another pharmacy.</font>

217
00:19:28,203 --> 00:19:29,947
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Bullshit.
- Didn't you expect me?</font>

218
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,749
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- I didn't make no drugstore in years.
- Bullshit!</font>

219
00:19:32,874 --> 00:19:36,160
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Look, man, you ain't gonna find nothing.</font>

220
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:44,335
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just let me phone my lawyer. I'm sure
he can straighten this whole thing out.</font>

221
00:19:44,468 --> 00:19:47,884
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Do I look like I'm using?
- You piece of shit.</font>

222
00:19:51,517 --> 00:19:55,431
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's real nice, Bob. Looks
like you're hooked to the gills.</font>

223
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:58,304
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- You got a warrant?
- Yeah, I got a warrant.</font>

224
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,646
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Pasted on the end of one of these slugs.</font>

225
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:06,025
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You give me any more shit, I'm gonna
give you a good close look at one of 'em.</font>

226
00:20:06,155 --> 00:20:10,615
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Whoa, heavy, man. You guys been readin'
too much Mickey Spillane or somethin'?</font>

227
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,534
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You don't seem to understand.</font>

228
00:20:13,537 --> 00:20:16,538
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, come on. Not those clubs.
Those are my Ben Hogans.</font>

229
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:19,869
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why you gotta mess with the clubs?</font>

230
00:20:22,795 --> 00:20:27,124
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- What are you hittin' these days?
- I got my handicap down around eight.</font>

231
00:20:27,258 --> 00:20:30,543
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Eight? Bullshit. Where do you play?</font>

232
00:20:30,678 --> 00:20:33,215
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Mayfield. I hit a 75
last time I was out there.</font>

233
00:20:33,347 --> 00:20:36,264
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't play public courses.
Mayfield is for pussies.</font>

234
00:20:36,391 --> 00:20:38,099
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's why you have that handicap.</font>

235
00:20:38,226 --> 00:20:40,847
<font face="Trebuchet MS">How am I supposed to play?
My clubs are all broke.</font>

236
00:20:42,188 --> 00:20:44,264
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Have a heart.</font>

237
00:20:44,983 --> 00:20:47,652
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Break two more, then leave
the fuckin' clubs alone.</font>

238
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,359
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- All right?
- Thanks, man.</font>

239
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,693
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Dianne, you haven't hid
the drugs in some stupid place</font>

240
00:20:55,826 --> 00:20:57,865
<font face="Trebuchet MS">like the Frosted Flakes again, have you?</font>

241
00:20:57,995 --> 00:21:01,197
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't know what the hell
you're talkin' about, fuckwad.</font>

242
00:21:09,422 --> 00:21:14,379
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Jesus. How old is she? Is she over 18?
- 22. You're 22 years old, right?</font>

243
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,549
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- 22.
- 22.</font>

244
00:21:17,054 --> 00:21:19,093
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Lucky for you.</font>

245
00:21:19,681 --> 00:21:23,548
<font face="Trebuchet MS">OK, kiddies. Here's how it's comin' down.</font>

246
00:21:23,685 --> 00:21:28,311
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You can just tell us where the drugs are
and save yourself a whole lot of trouble,</font>

247
00:21:30,775 --> 00:21:33,016
<font face="Trebuchet MS">or you can sit there
with your mouths shut</font>

248
00:21:33,152 --> 00:21:37,280
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and we're gonna tear this place apart
board by board. Now, how's it gonna be?</font>

249
00:22:00,677 --> 00:22:02,717
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Man, I love cops.</font>

250
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:06,637
<font face="Trebuchet MS">If there were no hot-shit
cops like Gentry around</font>

251
00:22:06,766 --> 00:22:11,095
<font face="Trebuchet MS">the competition would be so heavy,
there'd be nothing left to steal.</font>

252
00:22:11,562 --> 00:22:13,354
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Right?</font>

253
00:22:22,406 --> 00:22:24,445
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right.</font>

254
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,859
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You two take the car
and get an apartment.</font>

255
00:22:31,664 --> 00:22:35,115
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get something on the west side.
We ain't hit nothing there in weeks.</font>

256
00:22:35,251 --> 00:22:37,824
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- It should be pretty cool by now.
- OK, Bob.</font>

257
00:22:37,962 --> 00:22:42,089
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Don't mess it up.
- I'm not gonna mess it up. Just relax.</font>

258
00:22:42,758 --> 00:22:47,051
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Dianne and I are going over to my
mother's house to get some new threads.</font>

259
00:22:47,178 --> 00:22:49,218
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Something nice.</font>

260
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:54,512
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Oh!
- Hi, Ma.</font>

261
00:22:54,644 --> 00:22:59,851
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Lord, it's my dope-fiend thief of a son
and his crazy little nymphomaniac wife.</font>

262
00:23:00,441 --> 00:23:02,480
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ma.</font>

263
00:23:04,653 --> 00:23:05,767
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, Ma.</font>

264
00:23:14,787 --> 00:23:17,195
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Please tell me what I did to deserve this.</font>

265
00:23:17,331 --> 00:23:21,459
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Never knowing when there'll be a knock
on my door telling me my baby's dead.</font>

266
00:23:21,585 --> 00:23:24,041
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Green with an overdose.</font>

267
00:23:26,632 --> 00:23:32,254
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Shot by a mad pharmacist or run over
by a car while fleeing from police pursuit.</font>

268
00:23:32,387 --> 00:23:33,418
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why me?</font>

269
00:23:33,555 --> 00:23:37,089
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You have the clothes I left here
last time I was sent to the joint?</font>

270
00:23:37,225 --> 00:23:39,680
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I threw them away.
I thought you'd never get out.</font>

271
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,304
<font face="Trebuchet MS">How could you think that?</font>

272
00:23:41,437 --> 00:23:46,229
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He is a thief and a dope fiend, and
that is more important to him than I am.</font>

273
00:23:47,442 --> 00:23:48,984
<font face="Trebuchet MS">If you say so, Ma.</font>

274
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:58,112
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He can go to prison. He likes it
there anyway. Don't you, Robert?</font>

275
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,912
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why do you hate Bob and I so, Mama?</font>

276
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:07,793
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What have we ever done
to make you hate us so?</font>

277
00:24:09,296 --> 00:24:13,293
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't hate you, Dianne,
and I don't hate Robert either</font>

278
00:24:13,425 --> 00:24:16,758
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and the Good Lord knows
that to be the truth.</font>

279
00:24:16,886 --> 00:24:19,424
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I truly feel pity for you both.</font>

280
00:24:19,555 --> 00:24:21,382
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You are grown-up now,</font>

281
00:24:21,515 --> 00:24:26,426
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and yet you still act as children who
wanna do nothing but run and play.</font>

282
00:24:26,562 --> 00:24:29,728
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You cannot run and play
all your life, Dianne.</font>

283
00:24:40,783 --> 00:24:44,911
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Is there anything else of yours up there?
- Give it away. I can always get more.</font>

284
00:24:45,037 --> 00:24:47,492
<font face="Trebuchet MS">To be sure. You'll just
go steal some more.</font>

285
00:25:05,347 --> 00:25:07,803
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Shut up!</font>

286
00:25:13,522 --> 00:25:16,191
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So, this is our new home.</font>

287
00:25:16,316 --> 00:25:18,355
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, Bob.</font>

288
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:24,192
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why do they call it "Josephine"?</font>

289
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:28,237
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't know. The guy that
rented it to me is named Dale.</font>

290
00:25:30,788 --> 00:25:33,457
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Maybe "Josephine" sounds better.</font>

291
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:37,828
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>The last time I dropped acid,
I decided to make a self-portrait.</i></font>

292
00:25:38,795 --> 00:25:40,787
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Groovy, isn't it?</i></font>

293
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:51,506
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I can just see all those bottles of pills
that hospital's holding for me right now.</font>

294
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,175
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Our stereo buy of the month.</i></font>

295
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,137
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hot dog!</font>

296
00:25:57,896 --> 00:26:02,557
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Bob, speaking of dogs, do you think
that Rick and I could get a little pup?</font>

297
00:26:02,692 --> 00:26:07,270
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Just a little something to hold
and pet when you guys are gone?</font>

298
00:26:07,405 --> 00:26:09,777
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No.</font>

299
00:26:09,907 --> 00:26:12,030
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No fucking dogs.</font>

300
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:18,580
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- What have you got against dogs?
- Look, no fucking dogs, and that's final.</font>

301
00:26:18,707 --> 00:26:22,122
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why don't you tell them what happened
to the last one we had?</font>

302
00:26:22,252 --> 00:26:25,205
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>If you want them to know so much,
why don't you tell them?</i></font>

303
00:26:25,338 --> 00:26:27,377
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't want to discuss it.</font>

304
00:26:28,841 --> 00:26:32,424
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We had a dog once. His name was Panda.</font>

305
00:26:34,013 --> 00:26:36,847
<font face="Trebuchet MS">The cutest little pup you ever did see.</font>

306
00:26:36,974 --> 00:26:40,805
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That little guy used to
follow Bob wherever he'd go.</font>

307
00:26:42,187 --> 00:26:47,347
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Anyway, what happened was
the police were after us during a raid...</font>

308
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:49,684
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>on a drugstore in the city.</i></font>

309
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:53,022
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He came out of the bedroom
and he stopped at the closet</font>

310
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,652
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and then he swung at me
with that iron bar.</font>

311
00:26:55,783 --> 00:26:58,867
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Little Panda got out
of the car and ran away.</i></font>

312
00:26:59,202 --> 00:27:01,574
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>We looked everywhere
but there wasn't time.</i></font>

313
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:05,498
<font face="Trebuchet MS">The heat was on us and
we had to get out of there.</font>

314
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:13,372
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We thought the little guy
got hit by a car or something.</font>

315
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:15,754
<font face="Trebuchet MS">But no.</font>

316
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,427
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>The police had him.</i></font>

317
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:23,967
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Somehow they knew he was our dog.
They followed him all the way home.</i></font>

318
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,807
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>He led them to us.</i></font>

319
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,646
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They put us in jail...</font>

320
00:27:34,693 --> 00:27:37,363
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and they put little Panda to sleep.</font>

321
00:27:40,907 --> 00:27:45,569
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>For a brighter coat, whiter teeth
and a more even disposition,</i></font>

322
00:27:45,829 --> 00:27:47,821
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>there should only be one choice.</i></font>

323
00:27:48,206 --> 00:27:50,993
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Rich gravy. No cereal. Gravy...</i></font>

324
00:27:56,755 --> 00:28:00,171
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nadine, do you have any idea
what you've done to us</font>

325
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,376
<font face="Trebuchet MS">by just mentioning dogs in our home?</font>

326
00:28:02,511 --> 00:28:05,048
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- No. What'd I just do?
- You've no idea?</font>

327
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,849
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, I don't, Bob. What'd I do?</font>

328
00:28:12,353 --> 00:28:15,473
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You just put a 30-day hex
on us. That's what you did.</font>

329
00:28:15,606 --> 00:28:18,975
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Our luck just flew out the window
for the next 30 days.</font>

330
00:28:20,944 --> 00:28:26,021
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You got a calendar so we'll know when
this hex ends? What month is it, anyway?</font>

331
00:28:27,117 --> 00:28:29,109
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Jesus, Bob.</font>

332
00:28:29,244 --> 00:28:33,537
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You never told us anything
about not mentioning dogs.</font>

333
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,582
<font face="Trebuchet MS">The reason nobody
mentioned dogs, Rick,</font>

334
00:28:36,709 --> 00:28:40,956
<font face="Trebuchet MS">is because just to have mentioned
a dog would have been a hex in itself.</font>

335
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:46,248
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Are there any other sacred things
we're not supposed to mention?</font>

336
00:28:46,384 --> 00:28:49,054
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah. As a matter of fact there are.</font>

337
00:28:49,763 --> 00:28:54,638
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We might as well discuss 'em now, being
as we're shut down for the next 30 days.</font>

338
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,720
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hats.</font>

339
00:28:57,853 --> 00:28:59,762
<font face="Trebuchet MS">OK. Hats.</font>

340
00:28:59,897 --> 00:29:05,436
<font face="Trebuchet MS">If I ever see a hat on a bed in this house,
man, like, you'll never see me again.</font>

341
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:08,273
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- I'm gone.
- That makes two of us.</font>

342
00:29:10,407 --> 00:29:13,692
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Why a hat?
- Because that's just the way it is, sweetie.</font>

343
00:29:15,244 --> 00:29:18,993
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And there's mirrors. Never look
at the backside of a mirror.</font>

344
00:29:19,206 --> 00:29:24,117
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It'll affect your future because
you're looking at yourself backwards.</font>

345
00:29:27,214 --> 00:29:29,669
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No. You're looking at your inner self.</font>

346
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,879
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And you don't recognise it
because you've never seen it before.</font>

347
00:29:36,014 --> 00:29:40,841
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Anyway, you can freeze into motion your
future, and that can be either good or bad.</font>

348
00:29:40,976 --> 00:29:43,646
<font face="Trebuchet MS">In any case, we don't
want to take any chances.</font>

349
00:29:43,771 --> 00:29:47,554
<font face="Trebuchet MS">But the most important thing
is the goddamn hat.</font>

350
00:29:48,734 --> 00:29:51,569
<font face="Trebuchet MS">A goddamn hat on the bed
is the king of 'em all.</font>

351
00:29:52,946 --> 00:29:57,738
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hell, that's worth at least... what?
15 years' bad luck, or even death.</font>

352
00:29:57,867 --> 00:30:01,615
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And I'd rather have death cos
I couldn't face no 15-year hex.</font>

353
00:30:01,746 --> 00:30:04,415
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Relax, hon. Just go lay down awhile.</font>

354
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:10,294
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You been on the go for days now.
This 30-days thing ain't gonna kill us.</font>

355
00:30:26,685 --> 00:30:29,141
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't let it get you down, Bob.</font>

356
00:30:30,731 --> 00:30:33,400
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Sometimes bad luck can be good luck.</font>

357
00:30:35,944 --> 00:30:42,313
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I mean, think of all the times we had
a flat tyre or engine trouble or something</font>

358
00:30:43,701 --> 00:30:47,235
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and we made it to our score
late thinking it was bad luck.</font>

359
00:30:48,288 --> 00:30:51,740
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Then we'd find out for
some reason it was good luck.</font>

360
00:30:53,168 --> 00:30:55,623
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know what I mean?</font>

361
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:59,257
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hell, I can't figure it out.</font>

362
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:04,549
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I just know from years of experience</font>

363
00:31:05,554 --> 00:31:10,975
<font face="Trebuchet MS">the things to look for and the signs and...</font>

364
00:31:12,853 --> 00:31:17,847
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know what it's like? It's like, who's
ever managing such things is saying</font>

365
00:31:17,983 --> 00:31:20,652
<font face="Trebuchet MS">"Go out there and get it."</font>

366
00:31:21,152 --> 00:31:23,821
<font face="Trebuchet MS">"It's there for the taking, kid."</font>

367
00:31:24,614 --> 00:31:29,074
<font face="Trebuchet MS">"Everything's free this week. I'll
let you know when your time's up."</font>

368
00:31:34,748 --> 00:31:37,369
<font face="Trebuchet MS">"You'll see the signs."</font>

369
00:31:37,501 --> 00:31:41,118
<font face="Trebuchet MS">"Hell, all you gotta do
is look for the signs."</font>

370
00:31:52,014 --> 00:31:54,469
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Shit. Sorry, baby.</font>

371
00:31:55,642 --> 00:31:57,386
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Sorry about that, baby.</font>

372
00:32:13,283 --> 00:32:15,739
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So what's going on?</font>

373
00:32:17,954 --> 00:32:21,537
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why don't we just go in, we plant
some stuff on them, we drag 'em on in?</font>

374
00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:24,204
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It works all the time.</font>

375
00:32:24,335 --> 00:32:28,664
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll tell you why not. I don't wanna get
Bob Hughes on no bullshit possession beef,</font>

376
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:31,633
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and that's all we'll get him on
unless we catch him cold,</font>

377
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:34,594
<font face="Trebuchet MS">on his way home from
a score. You know that.</font>

378
00:32:39,182 --> 00:32:40,297
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</font>

379
00:32:45,647 --> 00:32:48,980
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>- Who is it, Bob?
- I don't know. I thought you knew.</i></font>

380
00:32:52,111 --> 00:32:54,602
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Hi.
- Did I wake you up?</font>

381
00:32:54,738 --> 00:32:56,149
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- No, no, no.
- No.</font>

382
00:32:56,281 --> 00:33:00,030
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- We were awake, weren't we, Rick?
- Well, I don't know what to think.</font>

383
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:05,664
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I saw this sinister-looking
man with a ladder</font>

384
00:33:05,999 --> 00:33:09,782
<font face="Trebuchet MS">creeping around outside
my bedroom window.</font>

385
00:33:10,002 --> 00:33:13,916
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I know that I wouldn't
be able to sleep a wink</font>

386
00:33:14,048 --> 00:33:19,006
<font face="Trebuchet MS">if I thought there was some crazy sex
maniac running around loose out there.</font>

387
00:33:19,136 --> 00:33:23,513
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Now, you just relax. We'll go down
there and check it out immediately.</font>

388
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,340
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Thank you very much.
- We'll check it out as soon as we can.</font>

389
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,885
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Good night.
- Good night.</font>

390
00:33:30,688 --> 00:33:32,182
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Good night.
- Good night.</font>

391
00:33:32,315 --> 00:33:34,354
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Night.
- Bye-bye.</font>

392
00:33:38,862 --> 00:33:42,563
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What the hell is she doin' up
at two o'clock in the morning?</font>

393
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:55,207
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's Gentry.</font>

394
00:33:56,462 --> 00:33:58,205
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah.</font>

395
00:33:58,339 --> 00:34:01,008
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I bet he followed us when we moved.</font>

396
00:34:01,717 --> 00:34:04,172
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Son of a bitch.</font>

397
00:34:06,763 --> 00:34:08,091
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah.</font>

398
00:34:08,932 --> 00:34:12,632
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, I guess we'll have to
teach him a little lesson, huh?</font>

399
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,494
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>"The reason you can never get Bob
Hughes for possession of narcotics is</i></font>

400
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:43,204
<font face="Trebuchet MS">that he has an arrangement with the guy
that lives on the north side of him."</font>

401
00:34:43,338 --> 00:34:45,580
<font face="Trebuchet MS">"They have a line between their houses."</font>

- Bye-bye.</font>

You think it might be junk?</font>

410
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:31,712
<font face="Trebuchet MS">One thing I am positive of -
it's not his goddamn lunch.</font>

411
00:35:32,592 --> 00:35:36,008
<font face="Trebuchet MS">About two o'clock this morning,
I look out my window and there he is.</font>

412
00:35:36,137 --> 00:35:39,221
<font face="Trebuchet MS">A big, ugly son of a bitch
wearing a long, dark raincoat,</font>

413
00:35:39,348 --> 00:35:43,595
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and he's standing on top of this ladder
looking in your upstairs windows.</font>

414
00:35:43,727 --> 00:35:46,218
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He's got one hand
underneath his raincoat.</font>

415
00:35:46,355 --> 00:35:49,521
<font face="Trebuchet MS">From where I was standing,
I gotta say, it looked kinda sick.</font>

416
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:53,517
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- I'll shoot the son of a bitch in the balls!
- Now hang on a second.</font>

417
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,899
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Did you see the way
they talked? All the gestures?</font>

418
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:02,616
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They got something goin' on.
They ain't just casual acquaintances.</font>

419
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:05,200
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, I can see that.</font>

420
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:10,912
<font face="Trebuchet MS">For a second there, it looked like
that big guy was gonna jump on Hughes</font>

421
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,084
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and stomp his guts out.</font>

422
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,205
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I would've liked to have seen that.</font>

423
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,756
<font face="Trebuchet MS">OK, I know what you guys are thinkin'.</font>

424
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,335
<font face="Trebuchet MS">"What's old Bob got me into this time?"</font>

425
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:26,381
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, let me tell you, this is gonna be
something. You guys are gonna love this.</font>

426
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:30,431
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Dianne, where you goin'?
- I'm just gonna go get my cigarettes.</font>

427
00:36:30,562 --> 00:36:33,682
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right. Hurry up. You're not
gonna want to miss this one.</font>

428
00:36:33,815 --> 00:36:37,266
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Rick, where you goin'?
- I'm just gettin' a beer, Bob.</font>

429
00:36:37,402 --> 00:36:40,687
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right. Don't come crying
to me when you miss out.</font>

430
00:36:40,822 --> 00:36:43,609
<font face="Trebuchet MS">OK. Sh! Here they come.
There's two of 'em.</font>

431
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:55,953
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Come here. Come over here. All right.</font>

432
00:36:56,127 --> 00:37:00,125
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They're making their move.
One guy's climbing up the ladder.</font>

433
00:37:00,256 --> 00:37:03,043
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I hope he gets pissed off at them, man.</font>

434
00:37:03,509 --> 00:37:06,759
<font face="Trebuchet MS">OK. The neighbour's comin'
out of the house. Holy shit!</font>

435
00:37:07,054 --> 00:37:09,592
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He's got a shotgun!</font>

436
00:37:09,932 --> 00:37:12,304
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.</font>

437
00:37:12,434 --> 00:37:13,845
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Show time!</font>

438
00:37:16,229 --> 00:37:17,771
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Whoa!</font>

439
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,271
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Holy shit!</font>

440
00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:33,173
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Bob, I wanna talk to you
about what happened last night.</font>

441
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:38,128
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We told the investigating officer all
we knew. We have nothing further to add.</font>

442
00:38:39,056 --> 00:38:42,555
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You little punk. Halamer and
Trousinski know you set them up,</font>

443
00:38:42,684 --> 00:38:46,432
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and I can honestly say they are
anything but happy about it.</font>

444
00:38:46,938 --> 00:38:49,429
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Now, Bob, I'm gonna make
a suggestion to you.</font>

445
00:38:49,565 --> 00:38:53,183
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why don't you take a nice long drive
somewhere far away from here?</font>

446
00:38:53,944 --> 00:38:58,985
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Wait a minute, Gentry. I won
the goddamn war, not you.</font>

447
00:39:00,492 --> 00:39:03,161
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Who are you to dictate the terms?</font>

448
00:39:03,286 --> 00:39:07,153
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Why don't you find a small-town police
department where you can be sheriff</i></font>

449
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:11,750
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and all you gotta worry about is Saturday
night drunks and kids on Halloween?</font>

450
00:39:14,922 --> 00:39:17,377
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So you think you won the war, huh?</font>

451
00:39:17,716 --> 00:39:19,922
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Pick him up.</font>

452
00:39:24,389 --> 00:39:28,054
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're just a junkie that got
one of my officers shot.</font>

453
00:39:28,184 --> 00:39:32,727
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And as soon as he gets ahold of you,
everybody'll forget you ever existed.</font>

454
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:37,937
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let him go.</font>

455
00:39:40,612 --> 00:39:42,652
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You little piece of shit.</font>

456
00:39:48,078 --> 00:39:50,747
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let me give you a hand up, Bob.</font>

457
00:39:51,706 --> 00:39:53,497
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Fuck you, Gentry.</font>

458
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:57,538
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't forget your clubs, pal.
Work on your handicap.</font>

459
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:10,300
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Don't think Gentry was running us out
of town, because I can stand the heat.</i></font>

460
00:40:10,432 --> 00:40:13,302
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>We were splittin' because
things were going all wrong.</i></font>

461
00:40:13,685 --> 00:40:16,934
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Nadine's hex was a little more
powerful than I had calculated.</i></font>

462
00:40:18,439 --> 00:40:22,567
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>It was time to change the scenery, which
happened when you went crossroading.</i></font>

463
00:40:22,693 --> 00:40:25,777
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Dianne got the narcotics together
and sent them ahead by bus</i></font>

464
00:40:25,904 --> 00:40:28,276
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>to depots across the
Pacific Northwest</i></font>

465
00:40:28,406 --> 00:40:31,941
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>so we could rendezvous with
the drugs as we needed them.</i></font>

466
00:40:32,118 --> 00:40:35,368
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>We couldn't afford to be caught
with a car full of narcotics,</i></font>

467
00:40:35,496 --> 00:40:39,707
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>so we had a backup plan in the form of a
hole punched in the floorboard of our car.</i></font>

468
00:40:41,377 --> 00:40:46,085
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>When the flashing red lights became a
reality, down the hole went the stash.</i></font>

469
00:40:46,214 --> 00:40:48,171
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Is something the matter, Officer?</font>

470
00:40:48,633 --> 00:40:50,673
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Then we'd go to the next rendezvous,</i></font>

471
00:40:50,802 --> 00:40:55,131
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>which was hopefully within eight
hours, before the drugs wore off.</i></font>

472
00:40:55,264 --> 00:41:00,471
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>No construction stiff workin' overtime
takes more stress and strain than we did,</i></font>

473
00:41:00,603 --> 00:41:02,761
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>just trying to stay high.</i></font>

474
00:42:01,409 --> 00:42:05,406
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We rented this truck not necessarily
because we need another vehicle.</font>

475
00:42:05,538 --> 00:42:07,779
<font face="Trebuchet MS">But we can move easier
in a vehicle like this.</font>

476
00:42:07,915 --> 00:42:11,283
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's got the right licence plates
so the average Joe will just think</font>

477
00:42:11,418 --> 00:42:15,581
<font face="Trebuchet MS">we're a couple farm boys and a prostitute
in town for a little joyride.</font>

478
00:42:15,714 --> 00:42:16,709
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey!</font>

479
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,128
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I always wanted to be a farmer, Bob.</font>

480
00:42:26,765 --> 00:42:29,435
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Whoa. Did you guys see that?</font>

481
00:42:30,727 --> 00:42:33,432
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- What?
- The transom.</font>

482
00:42:33,563 --> 00:42:36,434
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You guys didn't see the open transom?</font>

483
00:42:36,566 --> 00:42:39,318
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- No.
- What's a transom, Bob?</font>

484
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:45,199
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's all clear in the back.</font>

485
00:42:46,409 --> 00:42:49,694
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right. Gimme a lift,
then meet me around back.</font>

486
00:42:50,621 --> 00:42:53,290
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ready? One, two, three.</font>

487
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:21,600
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nadine, take these and
put it inside the truck.</font>

488
00:43:21,733 --> 00:43:26,774
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Rick, step in here. I want you to look at
these two safes. See them over there?</font>

489
00:43:43,211 --> 00:43:45,250
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Rick. Let's go.</font>

490
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:53,550
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Shut up!</font>

491
00:43:57,182 --> 00:44:00,717
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Christ! You're finished,
hopheads. You blew it.</font>

492
00:44:11,153 --> 00:44:14,071
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, babe, you playin'
cards? Who's winning?</font>

493
00:44:14,198 --> 00:44:16,107
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>What's the matter with her?</i></font>

494
00:44:16,325 --> 00:44:18,364
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nothin'.</font>

495
00:44:18,994 --> 00:44:21,033
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Cocaine.</font>

496
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,833
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Holy shit.
- What is it, Bob?</font>

497
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,745
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Powdered Dilaudid, that's what.</font>

498
00:44:31,881 --> 00:44:36,258
<font face="Trebuchet MS">A whole, untouched one-eighth
ounce bottle of powdered D.</font>

499
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:38,128
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Whoo!</font>

500
00:44:38,262 --> 00:44:42,508
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Should be another partially
filled one in here somewhere.</font>

501
00:44:43,934 --> 00:44:45,973
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You see it?</font>

502
00:44:47,478 --> 00:44:51,262
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Rick, do you have any idea
what this little bottle is worth?</font>

503
00:44:51,399 --> 00:44:56,440
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- No, Bob. What's it worth?
- This here little bottle...</font>

504
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:58,610
<font face="Trebuchet MS">has got 840-some-odd sixteenths.</font>

505
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:03,235
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And at ten dollars a sixteenth,
that comes to around 8,400 dollars</font>

506
00:45:03,452 --> 00:45:07,235
<font face="Trebuchet MS">of the best goddamn
pharmaceutical dope money can buy.</font>

507
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:12,752
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What a find. This here little bottle
ought to last the three of us a week.</font>

508
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:16,206
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'd better take that.</font>

509
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,912
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Guess we must've outrun
that hex we had on us, eh, Bob?</font>

510
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:24,593
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Sure glad we started crossroading.
- Bob? Let's shoot it.</font>

511
00:45:24,846 --> 00:45:28,215
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You gotta be careful with
this stuff. It can kill you.</font>

512
00:45:29,392 --> 00:45:31,349
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Dianne, get a glass of water.</font>

513
00:45:36,565 --> 00:45:38,605
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Do it slow.</font>

514
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,698
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll show you how we're
gonna hide this stuff.</font>

515
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:55,078
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Right up here.</font>

516
00:46:14,017 --> 00:46:16,638
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Now, we'll take this stuff</font>

517
00:46:16,769 --> 00:46:20,054
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and then we'll cross over
a couple of these units</font>

518
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:23,609
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and stash it over somebody else's room.</font>

519
00:46:38,914 --> 00:46:39,910
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Wow.</font>

520
00:46:50,008 --> 00:46:51,632
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey.</font>

521
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:54,049
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey.</font>

522
00:46:55,722 --> 00:46:57,761
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Come on. Buck up.</font>

523
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:01,055
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So you blew it. Big deal.</font>

524
00:47:01,644 --> 00:47:06,186
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Listen, we're gonna go out for a couple of
hours, but we'll be back in a little bit.</font>

525
00:47:08,567 --> 00:47:11,140
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What'd that son of a bitch say about me?</font>

526
00:47:11,278 --> 00:47:13,317
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He didn't say anything about you.</font>

527
00:47:13,446 --> 00:47:16,281
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, but he's not gonna
take me along any more, is he?</font>

528
00:47:16,407 --> 00:47:22,243
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Then one day you'll all just drop me off
somewhere and you'll never come back.</font>

529
00:47:25,124 --> 00:47:27,793
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nadine, what are you talkin' about?</font>

530
00:47:28,961 --> 00:47:32,792
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Come on, honey. You're with me.
I'm not gonna leave you anywhere.</font>

531
00:47:33,882 --> 00:47:35,708
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He is a goddamn...</font>

532
00:47:35,842 --> 00:47:36,957
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Shut up!
...hog!</font>

533
00:47:37,135 --> 00:47:39,293
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Hog! Hog!
- Hey, shut up. Come on, honey.</font>

534
00:47:39,429 --> 00:47:43,473
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Hog!
- Don't do that. Please, Nadine.</font>

535
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:47,519
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We got a good thing goin' here.</font>

536
00:47:48,062 --> 00:47:50,731
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why do you want to rock the boat?</font>

537
00:47:51,064 --> 00:47:53,733
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I just can't stand their superior ways.</font>

538
00:47:54,568 --> 00:47:59,644
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And all that crap about hexes.
You don't believe that stuff, do you?</font>

539
00:47:59,781 --> 00:48:02,188
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Look, Nadine, I don't know. OK?</font>

540
00:48:02,325 --> 00:48:07,117
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I mean, all we have to do is not talk about
pets and not leave any hats on any beds.</font>

541
00:48:07,246 --> 00:48:09,867
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Now, what's hard about that?</font>

542
00:48:09,998 --> 00:48:16,250
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm just gonna prove to all of you that
a hat on a bed doesn't mean anything.</font>

543
00:48:18,214 --> 00:48:20,456
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, Rick. Let's go. Come on.</font>

544
00:48:20,592 --> 00:48:23,261
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I really wish you hadn't done that.</font>

545
00:48:32,436 --> 00:48:37,856
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're just goin' out with them tonight.
When you come back, I'll show all of you.</font>

546
00:48:37,983 --> 00:48:41,766
<font face="Trebuchet MS">When I come back, I don't want to see
that hat on the bed. All right, honey?</font>

547
00:48:44,572 --> 00:48:48,819
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know, Nadine, there's just
no talking to you sometimes. Fuck.</font>

548
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:01,666
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, Rick. Rick. Rick.</font>

549
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,044
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't be too aggressive, man. We're
just trying to create a diversion. OK?</font>

550
00:49:07,176 --> 00:49:10,093
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- I don't want anybody gettin' hurt.
- OK, Bob.</font>

551
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:17,519
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- OK, babe, you all set?
- Yeah.</font>

552
00:49:57,848 --> 00:49:59,306
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Prepare to die.</font>

553
00:51:05,243 --> 00:51:06,785
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Demerol. Shit.</font>

554
00:51:26,012 --> 00:51:27,423
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Argh!</font>

555
00:51:43,654 --> 00:51:46,323
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This just isn't like him.</font>

556
00:51:46,448 --> 00:51:49,947
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Bob is like a rabbit.
In and out, and no nonsense.</font>

557
00:51:51,494 --> 00:51:54,614
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That goes for a lot more
than a hospital pharmacy.</font>

558
00:52:16,601 --> 00:52:21,595
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Mrs Robb to Admitting.
Mrs Jane Robb to Admitting.</i></font>

559
00:52:32,198 --> 00:52:34,072
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Fuck!</font>

560
00:53:18,991 --> 00:53:22,194
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't think he's gonna come.
Why don't we go back?</font>

561
00:53:24,538 --> 00:53:26,495
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They got him.</font>

562
00:53:26,624 --> 00:53:29,909
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Bastards got him. I know it.</font>

563
00:53:30,043 --> 00:53:32,795
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I can feel it in my heart.</font>

564
00:53:32,921 --> 00:53:34,960
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Dirty bastards.</font>

565
00:53:42,555 --> 00:53:44,594
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nadine.</font>

566
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:08,158
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, my God.</font>

567
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:13,203
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Honey? I'm home.</font>

568
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,877
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're not gonna believe the shit
that happened to me tonight.</font>

569
00:54:23,801 --> 00:54:25,877
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What's goin' on?</font>

570
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:28,051
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Who put the goddamn hat on the bed?</font>

571
00:54:28,681 --> 00:54:30,803
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She did, Bob.</font>

572
00:54:30,933 --> 00:54:33,340
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She didn't mean anything by it.</font>

573
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:46,610
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She bit it.</font>

574
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:55,453
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Where'd she get the stuff? She couldn't
have done this on no two sixteenths.</font>

575
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:58,250
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What's she been doing? Saving it up?</font>

576
00:55:05,006 --> 00:55:08,624
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Who gave her this?
- What is it?</font>

577
00:55:08,759 --> 00:55:12,045
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Damn! She must've picked it up
off the floor of the truck</font>

578
00:55:12,179 --> 00:55:14,931
<font face="Trebuchet MS">when we were collecting these bottles.</font>

579
00:55:16,767 --> 00:55:18,806
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Conniving little bitch.</font>

580
00:55:19,978 --> 00:55:22,017
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Bob?</font>

581
00:55:22,605 --> 00:55:26,685
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You can't say that
about her, Bob. She's dead.</font>

582
00:55:28,277 --> 00:55:30,946
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You don't say anything bad about her.</font>

583
00:55:34,825 --> 00:55:36,864
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Rick.</font>

584
00:55:38,662 --> 00:55:40,701
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She beat you.</font>

585
00:55:41,331 --> 00:55:46,158
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Your own woman beat you
out of your cut on a score.</font>

586
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:51,585
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She got what she deserves.</font>

587
00:55:53,759 --> 00:55:55,218
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Listen, man.</font>

588
00:55:55,344 --> 00:55:59,673
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Not only that. She threw a hex on us
we'll all be lucky to outrun, huh?</font>

589
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:06,100
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She left us with an OD'd stiff, which is
paramount to a murder beef in this state.</font>

590
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:09,514
<font face="Trebuchet MS">For Christ's sake, get this
goddamn hat off the bed!</font>

591
00:56:31,127 --> 00:56:32,621
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Cold.</font>

592
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:13,330
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hell, it's like trying
to raise a couple of kids</font>

593
00:57:13,458 --> 00:57:17,537
<font face="Trebuchet MS">when you take on a couple like that
and try and teach 'em to steal.</font>

594
00:57:18,754 --> 00:57:20,414
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Know what I mean, Dianne?</font>

595
00:57:22,341 --> 00:57:24,380
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All these kids.</font>

596
00:57:25,427 --> 00:57:27,466
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They're all TV babies.</font>

597
00:57:28,138 --> 00:57:32,467
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They've been watching people killin'
each other on the boob tube for so long,</font>

598
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,640
<font face="Trebuchet MS">it's all they know.</font>

599
00:57:35,436 --> 00:57:38,971
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hell, they think it's legal. They
think it's the right thing to do.</font>

600
00:57:39,106 --> 00:57:41,514
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I know, hon.</font>

601
00:57:46,363 --> 00:57:48,770
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm gettin' real tired.</font>

602
00:57:51,785 --> 00:57:53,444
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Poor Nadine.</font>

603
00:57:54,912 --> 00:57:57,783
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She was just a goddamn kid.</font>

604
00:58:01,544 --> 00:58:03,583
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Now what?</font>

605
00:58:06,923 --> 00:58:10,339
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Hello. Are you Mr Hughes?
- Yeah.</font>

606
00:58:10,468 --> 00:58:14,051
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Are you planning to check out today?
- No. Why?</font>

607
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,801
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, you see, sir,
we have prior commitments</font>

608
00:58:16,933 --> 00:58:21,013
<font face="Trebuchet MS">in the form of a reservation
for your room today.</font>

609
00:58:22,396 --> 00:58:24,685
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Today?</font>

610
00:58:24,815 --> 00:58:27,388
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- You mean check out today?
- I'm afraid so.</font>

611
00:58:27,526 --> 00:58:31,025
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You see, we're having
a sheriffs' convention in town</font>

612
00:58:31,154 --> 00:58:35,615
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and all these rooms have been reserved
in advance for them 90 days ago.</font>

613
00:58:40,246 --> 00:58:44,195
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All right. Could I go down to the office
and talk to you in about ten minutes?</font>

614
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:46,372
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Give me ten minutes.</font>

615
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,591
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We're gonna know
some of these guys, I'll bet.</font>

616
00:58:54,718 --> 00:58:57,718
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't believe it.
I don't fuckin' believe it.</font>

617
00:58:58,388 --> 00:59:01,139
<font face="Trebuchet MS">A sheriffs' convention, no less.</font>

618
00:59:01,265 --> 00:59:04,551
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why couldn't it have been
a Tupperware convention?</font>

619
00:59:05,227 --> 00:59:07,683
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Or better yet, an undertakers'.</font>

620
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:24,449
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Excuse me.</font>

621
00:59:31,835 --> 00:59:34,041
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hello?</font>

622
00:59:34,171 --> 00:59:36,210
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Anything?</font>

623
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:41,749
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Sorry, Mr Hughes. You should have let us
know you intended on staying this long.</font>

624
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:49,097
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Look, I've got a colleague in that room
and he's sick with the mumps.</font>

625
00:59:49,810 --> 00:59:53,143
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm afraid to move him. I mean,
what if they should spread?</font>

626
00:59:53,271 --> 00:59:57,399
<font face="Trebuchet MS">The doc said all we need is another day.
He can travel in another day. Come on.</font>

627
00:59:58,151 --> 00:59:59,894
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Come on.</font>

628
01:00:39,648 --> 01:00:42,317
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Lock him up.
He did it. Lock him up!</i></font>

629
01:00:42,442 --> 01:00:44,897
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Guilty! Guilty!</i></font>

630
01:00:48,698 --> 01:00:53,489
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's gonna be one heck of a time
getting her out of that crawlspace.</font>

631
01:00:56,204 --> 01:00:59,787
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't know if I'm ever gonna
get my nails done now.</font>

632
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:06,457
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nadine really got to you, didn't she, Bob?</font>

633
01:01:07,465 --> 01:01:10,134
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah, well, I'll tell you what's wrong.</font>

634
01:01:10,259 --> 01:01:14,257
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm afraid some big fat cop's gonna come
rumbling through this door any minute.</font>

635
01:01:14,388 --> 01:01:17,223
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He'll say "Get outta this room.
This is my room."</font>

636
01:01:22,562 --> 01:01:24,601
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Dianne.</font>

637
01:01:25,607 --> 01:01:27,646
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah?</font>

638
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:30,227
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I love you.</font>

639
01:01:33,072 --> 01:01:35,527
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I love you, too.</font>

640
01:01:49,212 --> 01:01:51,881
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Hey, Dianne?
- Hm?</font>

641
01:01:55,926 --> 01:01:59,046
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We have that blue garment bag?
The big one.</font>

642
01:02:40,676 --> 01:02:42,715
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Dianne?</font>

643
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:06,398
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't worry, Bob. We'll make it.
We always do, don't we?</font>

644
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:31,755
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Honey? Let's go, dear.
We're gonna miss our flight.</font>

645
01:03:32,849 --> 01:03:34,888
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hi.</font>

646
01:03:38,729 --> 01:03:40,769
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Wow.</font>

647
01:03:41,857 --> 01:03:44,313
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What a busy day.</font>

648
01:03:46,528 --> 01:03:48,402
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What do you say we go up to the attic,</font>

649
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:52,314
<font face="Trebuchet MS">divide the stuff up with Rick
and give him the big end?</font>

650
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:54,775
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Don't count him short.</font>

651
01:03:54,911 --> 01:03:58,114
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What's going on, Bob?
What are you thinking about?</font>

652
01:04:02,001 --> 01:04:04,040
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nothin'.</font>

653
01:04:07,589 --> 01:04:12,417
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm thinking about, uh...
headin' back home.</font>

654
01:04:14,053 --> 01:04:16,342
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Gettin' in the 21-day
methadone programme.</font>

655
01:04:16,681 --> 01:04:20,014
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Cleaning up my act.
- Are you kidding?</font>

656
01:04:21,143 --> 01:04:23,266
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, I'm not.</font>

657
01:04:25,981 --> 01:04:27,938
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Dianne,</font>

658
01:04:28,984 --> 01:04:31,439
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I can't do it any more.</font>

659
01:04:32,737 --> 01:04:35,228
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm not goin' on
no withdrawal programme.</font>

660
01:04:35,365 --> 01:04:37,820
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So what's gonna happen to me?</font>

661
01:04:38,701 --> 01:04:41,157
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why don't you come with me?</font>

662
01:04:41,746 --> 01:04:46,288
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, thanks, buster. Not a fucking word
do you mention about all this.</font>

663
01:04:46,875 --> 01:04:51,204
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Right out of the clear blue sky you say
you're gonna clean up your hand.</font>

664
01:04:51,338 --> 01:04:53,579
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And you know I can't.</font>

665
01:04:56,843 --> 01:04:59,168
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Look, Dianne, do what you want.</font>

666
01:04:59,303 --> 01:05:02,755
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Take whatever we got. I only
need enough to get me home.</font>

667
01:05:23,367 --> 01:05:26,238
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get the shovel. I'll take care of her.</font>

668
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:41,796
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Go back to the truck.</font>

669
01:05:52,144 --> 01:05:54,183
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Go.</font>

670
01:11:10,604 --> 01:11:14,601
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Have you ever been on
a withdrawal programme before?</i></font>

672
01:11:16,192 --> 01:11:20,735
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>I see. How long have
you been on drugs altogether?</i></font>

your first time withdrawing?</i></font>

<font face="Trebuchet MS">No.</font>

683
01:11:52,893 --> 01:11:54,850
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Um...</font>

684
01:11:54,978 --> 01:11:57,101

<font face="Trebuchet MS">Have you ever been
convicted of a felony?</font>

689

<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Yeah, a few times.
- What were they?</font>

690
01:12:16,748 --> 01:12:19,417
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What felonies were you convicted of?</font>

691

<font face="Trebuchet MS">What do you want? My life story?</font>

692
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,374
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Look, lady.</font>

693
01:12:25,673 --> 01:12:31,960
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm a junkie. I like drugs. I like the whole lifestyle.
But it just didn't pay off.</font>

694
01:12:35,307 --> 01:12:38,059
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know, you don't see
my kind of people.</font>

695
01:12:38,977 --> 01:12:42,512
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Cos my kind of people, they don't
come down here and beg dope.</font>

696
01:12:42,647 --> 01:12:46,347
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They go out and get it, and
if they miss, they go to jail</font>

697
01:12:46,484 --> 01:12:50,778
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and they kick alone with nothing
in some holding tank.</font>

698
01:12:52,114 --> 01:12:53,941
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm sorry, Bob.</font>

699
01:12:54,074 --> 01:12:56,281
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I don't mean to hassle you.</font>

700
01:12:56,410 --> 01:13:01,285
<font face="Trebuchet MS">All this is required. I'm sorry
if you think it's unnecessary.</font>

701
01:13:02,916 --> 01:13:06,000
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Have you ever considered
becoming a counsellor</font>

702
01:13:06,127 --> 01:13:09,294
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and helping other addicts
with their problems?</font>

703
01:13:09,422 --> 01:13:10,999
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No.</font>

704
01:13:11,132 --> 01:13:13,254
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why not?</font>

705
01:13:13,384 --> 01:13:16,420
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, to begin with,</font>

706
01:13:16,553 --> 01:13:22,591
<font face="Trebuchet MS">nobody - and I mean nobody -
can talk a junkie out of using.</font>

707
01:13:23,268 --> 01:13:28,095
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You can talk to them for years, but sooner
or later they'll get ahold of something.</font>

708
01:13:28,231 --> 01:13:31,813
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Maybe it's not dope. Maybe it's booze.</font>

709
01:13:31,943 --> 01:13:34,612
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Maybe it's glue. Maybe it's gasoline.</font>

710
01:13:35,613 --> 01:13:37,938
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Maybe it's a gunshot in the head.</font>

711
01:13:39,241 --> 01:13:41,068
<font face="Trebuchet MS">But something.</font>

712
01:13:41,201 --> 01:13:44,285
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Something to relieve the pressures
of their everyday life,</font>

713
01:13:44,412 --> 01:13:47,082
<font face="Trebuchet MS">like... having to tie their shoes.</font>

714
01:14:03,263 --> 01:14:05,718
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Tom, you got some mail here.</font>

715
01:14:08,268 --> 01:14:11,304
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Bless you.

717
01:14:29,662 --> 01:14:31,702
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, Tom.</font>

718
01:14:34,625 --> 01:14:36,867
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, well.</font>

719
01:14:37,545 --> 01:14:39,584
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Bad Bobby Hughes.</font>

720
01:14:40,714 --> 01:14:45,791
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Imagine seeing you here
after all these years.</font>

721
01:14:47,179 --> 01:14:48,922
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You live here too?</font>

722
01:14:49,055 --> 01:14:51,724
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I have nowhere else to go.</font>

723
01:14:52,976 --> 01:14:58,314
<font face="Trebuchet MS">There is no demand in the priesthood
for elderly drug addicts.</font>

724
01:14:58,439 --> 01:15:04,144
<font face="Trebuchet MS">An indiscretion in 1970-
you were inside, I believe...</font>

725
01:15:04,486 --> 01:15:08,234
<font face="Trebuchet MS">resulted in my descent to this sorry state.</font>

726
01:15:11,618 --> 01:15:15,911
<font face="Trebuchet MS">As a matter of fact,
I'm feeling a bit sick right now.</font>

727
01:15:16,956 --> 01:15:19,411
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Are you holding?</font>

728
01:15:20,084 --> 01:15:21,708
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nope.</font>

729
01:15:21,835 --> 01:15:25,750
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They got me on this
21-day thing. Methadone.</font>

730
01:15:28,091 --> 01:15:30,131
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What about yourself?</font>

731
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:32,592
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, sure.</font>

732
01:15:32,846 --> 01:15:35,087
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm on the programme.</font>

733
01:15:35,223 --> 01:15:40,561
<font face="Trebuchet MS">But sometimes I get a little bit ahead
of my schedule. You understand?</font>

734
01:15:42,605 --> 01:15:50,398
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And sometimes I think some junkie nurse
may be stepping on my medication.</font>

735
01:15:51,863 --> 01:15:54,319
<font face="Trebuchet MS">But I can't be sure.</font>

736
01:15:56,075 --> 01:15:58,613
<font face="Trebuchet MS">How about it? You wanna score?</font>

737
01:15:58,744 --> 01:16:00,571
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nah.</font>

738
01:16:01,872 --> 01:16:04,494
<font face="Trebuchet MS">But I'll keep you company.</font>

739
01:16:06,543 --> 01:16:09,081
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This here is an art work.</font>

740
01:16:09,212 --> 01:16:11,668
<font face="Trebuchet MS">A work of art. So is that.</font>

741
01:16:13,425 --> 01:16:15,464
<font face="Trebuchet MS">More art work.</font>

742
01:16:15,927 --> 01:16:18,596
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Look at the bole on that tree there.</font>

743
01:16:20,806 --> 01:16:24,970
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That reminds me. I used
to know an old croaker.</font>

744
01:16:25,102 --> 01:16:29,100
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I think it was on that street.
Maybe it was the next street over.</font>

745
01:16:29,231 --> 01:16:32,647
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Ah... he'd write like a major.</font>

746
01:16:33,485 --> 01:16:36,936
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Tom knew his way
around the old neighbourhoods.</i></font>

747
01:16:37,822 --> 01:16:39,779
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>I'd known Tom since I
was an altar boy.</i></font>

748
01:16:39,907 --> 01:16:44,450
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Benevolent Father Murphy, the most
notorious dope fiend on the Coast.</i></font>

749
01:16:44,704 --> 01:16:49,614
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>When he was holding he'd always share with
those who weren't. He was very kind.</i></font>

750
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:54,625
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Tom was king then. He had it all.
His ass was covered in this life and the next.</i></font>

751
01:16:55,297 --> 01:16:58,167
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>I bet he shot a million
bucks in his arm.</i></font>

752
01:17:00,927 --> 01:17:04,046
<font face="Trebuchet MS">OK. This is what you call
a radial-arm drill press.</font>

753
01:17:04,972 --> 01:17:08,507
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Get the drill you want,
putting it in the holder.</font>

754
01:17:08,642 --> 01:17:10,967
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Make sure you've got a good grip on it.</font>

755
01:17:11,186 --> 01:17:15,231
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That brings your drill down to
your work. Position it over the hole.</font>

756
01:17:15,357 --> 01:17:18,311
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's your clutch.
This is your power feed.</font>

757
01:17:18,443 --> 01:17:21,194
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This is the clutch that
engages the power feed.</font>

758
01:17:21,321 --> 01:17:23,990
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Put that in and just let it drill.</font>

759
01:17:50,514 --> 01:17:52,637
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>You go to work loaded, it'll show.</i></font>

760
01:17:52,808 --> 01:17:55,133
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Being loaded's like being drunk.</font>

761
01:17:55,269 --> 01:17:58,803
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You drink or get high in the morning,
your boss is gonna see it.</font>

762
01:17:58,939 --> 01:18:01,429
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You'll get fired, then
you're not making money.</font>

763
01:18:01,566 --> 01:18:03,973
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Then you're gonna have
to do something else.</font>

764
01:18:04,110 --> 01:18:07,111
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're gonna have to rob,
steal, sell. You know?</font>

765
01:18:07,238 --> 01:18:08,946
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Um...</font>

766
01:18:09,073 --> 01:18:13,865
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Somewhere in that robbing you might
end up killing your best buddy over a fix.</font>

767
01:18:13,994 --> 01:18:17,114
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You'll go down the tubes.
There's no other way around it.</font>

768
01:18:17,247 --> 01:18:20,450
<font face="Trebuchet MS">The more you use, the longer
you use, the further down you go.</font>

769
01:18:21,418 --> 01:18:23,955
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Then you're gonna find
you're on the bottom.</font>

770
01:18:45,273 --> 01:18:47,846
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Catching up on your reading?</font>

771
01:18:51,737 --> 01:18:55,438
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You didn't stay gone long,
Bob. What happened?</font>

772
01:18:55,574 --> 01:18:57,613
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Nothing happened.</font>

773
01:18:58,076 --> 01:19:00,365
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I hear you're on a methadone programme.</font>

774
01:19:00,495 --> 01:19:05,038
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You don't think that'll keep Trousinski
from jumping your ass, do you?</font>

775
01:19:05,542 --> 01:19:08,377
<font face="Trebuchet MS">To tell you the truth,
I haven't given it much thought.</font>

776
01:19:09,837 --> 01:19:12,957
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know, for once
I'm not here to hassle you.</font>

777
01:19:13,090 --> 01:19:17,668
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Trousinski lost his gold badge over
that little incident. He's working traffic.</font>

778
01:19:17,803 --> 01:19:21,337
<font face="Trebuchet MS">He's made so many goddamn threats,
he's almost gonna have to hurt you.</font>

779
01:19:21,473 --> 01:19:24,142
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And I don't wanna see that happen.</font>

780
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:27,977
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Man, look. What can I say?
I got a job, you know?</font>

781
01:19:30,481 --> 01:19:34,313
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What happened out there in the sticks,
Bob? Where's Dianne?</font>

782
01:19:36,612 --> 01:19:39,281
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know how whimsical women are.</font>

783
01:19:40,324 --> 01:19:45,199
<font face="Trebuchet MS">She found some other dude to chase after
and off she went, chasin' after him.</font>

784
01:19:46,913 --> 01:19:49,321
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I find that a little hard to believe.</font>

785
01:19:49,624 --> 01:19:54,582
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You and Dianne have been running
around together since you were little kids.</font>

786
01:20:00,926 --> 01:20:03,595
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I hope you make out on that job of yours.</font>

787
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:07,338
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And I sincerely hope that
you straighten up a little bit.</font>

788
01:20:08,099 --> 01:20:09,759
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Take care of yourself, Bob.</font>

789
01:20:50,722 --> 01:20:53,295
<font face="Trebuchet MS">My old lady's still
out there right now.</font>

790
01:20:53,975 --> 01:20:56,726
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah. I can't do nothing with her. I tried.</font>

791
01:20:56,853 --> 01:21:01,680
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I told her to come. She won't come
cos she's doing her own thing.</font>

792
01:21:01,815 --> 01:21:04,650
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What I was doin', I was
goin' right to the source.</font>

793
01:21:05,319 --> 01:21:09,482
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Right to the source. Where do they
make drugs? In the drugstores.</font>

794
01:21:12,283 --> 01:21:15,035
<font face="Trebuchet MS">If you want some money
you go to the bank, huh?</font>

795
01:21:17,455 --> 01:21:22,662
<font face="Trebuchet MS">"Yeah, honey, I gotta stop by the bank and
the drugstore. I'll be home after a while."</font>

796
01:21:23,836 --> 01:21:27,750
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What are you crying for? You want
to do the drugs, you gotta pay for 'em.</font>

797
01:21:27,881 --> 01:21:30,337
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Where's my fuckin' money, you bitch?</font>

798
01:21:32,677 --> 01:21:35,168
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Punk. Where the fuck's my money?</font>

799
01:21:35,305 --> 01:21:37,795
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Come on. This is the third
time I had to ask you.</font>

800
01:21:37,932 --> 01:21:41,716
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What are you gonna say? Say something.
You want me to beat you more?</font>

801
01:21:41,852 --> 01:21:45,435
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, David. What do you
think you're doin', man?</font>

802
01:21:45,564 --> 01:21:47,722
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Huh? What do you think you're doin'?</font>

803
01:21:47,858 --> 01:21:50,349
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This kid's cryin', man.</font>

804
01:21:50,485 --> 01:21:52,691
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So? It's business. What do you care?</font>

805
01:21:52,821 --> 01:21:56,486
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why don't you go away and mind
your own business? What do you care?</font>

806
01:21:56,616 --> 01:21:58,158
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Cos it bugs me.</font>

807
01:21:58,284 --> 01:22:00,775
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Take a walk.
- Hey, man. Come on.</font>

808
01:22:00,912 --> 01:22:02,904
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Goddamn!</font>

809
01:22:03,039 --> 01:22:06,822
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>- David, why don't you grow up, man?
- I am grown-up.</i></font>

810
01:22:06,959 --> 01:22:08,785
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Asshole!</font>

811
01:22:09,628 --> 01:22:11,834
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Why didn't you do something, man?</font>

812
01:22:11,963 --> 01:22:16,791
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What's up with you, man? I thought you...
Man, I'm not buying you no lunch.</font>

813
01:22:20,054 --> 01:22:23,423
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know, Tom, you told me
a lot of the old-time stories</font>

814
01:22:23,557 --> 01:22:30,769
<font face="Trebuchet MS">about how you used to stick your arm
in between the bars of the cell</font>

815
01:22:31,106 --> 01:22:34,391
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and a guard would come by and
he'd fire you up a shot of morphine.</font>

816
01:22:34,526 --> 01:22:36,565
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They never did that for me.</font>

817
01:22:37,404 --> 01:22:40,073
<font face="Trebuchet MS">They don't do that for anyone any more.</font>

818
01:22:42,158 --> 01:22:50,450
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Narcotics have been systematically
scapegoated and demonised.</font>

819
01:22:52,542 --> 01:22:57,785
<font face="Trebuchet MS">The idea that anyone can use drugs
and escape a horrible fate</font>

820
01:22:57,922 --> 01:23:00,247
<font face="Trebuchet MS">is anathema to these idiots.</font>

821
01:23:01,509 --> 01:23:04,960
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I predict in the near future</font>

822
01:23:05,096 --> 01:23:09,757
<font face="Trebuchet MS">right-wingers will use drug hysteria</font>

823
01:23:10,476 --> 01:23:12,515
<font face="Trebuchet MS">as a pretext</font>

824
01:23:13,228 --> 01:23:18,269
<font face="Trebuchet MS">to set up an international
police apparatus.</font>

825
01:23:21,027 --> 01:23:28,025
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm an old man and I may not live to see
a final solution of the drug problem.</font>

826
01:23:30,869 --> 01:23:35,330
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know what, Tom? You might
have missed your calling.</font>

827
01:23:35,624 --> 01:23:37,912
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You should have been a philosopher.</font>

828
01:23:38,043 --> 01:23:41,957
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well, Bob, in another life,
perhaps. In another life.</font>

829
01:24:07,695 --> 01:24:09,734
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Who is it?</font>

830
01:24:10,531 --> 01:24:12,570
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Who is it?</font>

831
01:24:23,752 --> 01:24:25,329
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey.</font>

832
01:24:28,506 --> 01:24:31,590
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Jesus. What kind of a dump is this?</font>

833
01:24:33,093 --> 01:24:36,178
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And where is the female?
You might as well trot her out.</font>

834
01:24:36,305 --> 01:24:38,428
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You don't ever change, do you, Dianne?</font>

835
01:24:38,557 --> 01:24:41,226
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Goddamn right I don't. Why should I?</font>

836
01:24:42,352 --> 01:24:44,641
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I was just commenting
on how good you look.</font>

837
01:24:44,771 --> 01:24:48,815
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Yeah? I'll bet.
- Hey, how about a cup of tea?</font>

838
01:24:48,941 --> 01:24:50,850
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Yeah.
- Yeah?</font>

839
01:24:52,028 --> 01:24:55,112
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So, how's that methadone
thing workin' out?</font>

840
01:24:56,615 --> 01:24:58,109
<font face="Trebuchet MS">So-so.</font>

841
01:24:58,242 --> 01:25:03,698
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- I got a job. Did I tell you that?
- No shit! Where are you working?</font>

842
01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:04,779
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh,</font>

843
01:25:04,914 --> 01:25:06,954
<font face="Trebuchet MS">just a machine shop over on Western.</font>

844
01:25:07,083 --> 01:25:09,870
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah? What do you do there?</font>

845
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:13,589
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I, uh... I drill holes.</font>

846
01:25:14,173 --> 01:25:16,000
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Drill holes?
- Yeah.</font>

847
01:25:16,133 --> 01:25:20,878
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I drill... I drill these holes
that, uh, bolts fit into.</font>

848
01:25:21,763 --> 01:25:24,337
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah? How do you like it?</font>

849
01:25:24,474 --> 01:25:28,472
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll tell you the truth. It's kind of
a drag, but it pays the rent.</font>

850
01:25:32,982 --> 01:25:36,185
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Then you're really serious.
You're gonna go on with this thing.</font>

851
01:25:37,194 --> 01:25:38,569
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah.</font>

852
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:44,193
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Dianne, why don't you take
your coat off and stay awhile?</font>

853
01:25:44,326 --> 01:25:47,944
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I can't. I got people
waiting for me out in the car.</font>

854
01:25:48,079 --> 01:25:50,285
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I just came to see how you was doing.</font>

855
01:25:53,376 --> 01:25:54,704
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Here.</font>

856
01:25:55,503 --> 01:25:57,791
<font face="Trebuchet MS">That's from Rick and the rest of us.</font>

857
01:25:58,047 --> 01:26:01,498
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We kind of thought you might
need a taste once in a while.</font>

858
01:26:06,847 --> 01:26:09,598
<font face="Trebuchet MS">What happened? What made you
turn around that day?</font>

859
01:26:09,724 --> 01:26:12,641
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Was it me? Did I do something wrong?</font>

860
01:26:12,894 --> 01:26:15,349
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No, babe. It wasn't you.</font>

861
01:26:16,272 --> 01:26:20,186
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It was Nadine's death and the hex
she threw on us with that hat.</font>

862
01:26:20,818 --> 01:26:25,526
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Then I panicked when I looked out to the
parking lot and I saw all those cop cars.</font>

863
01:26:25,656 --> 01:26:30,613
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I knew I was dead. So I started coppin'
deuces. I prayed like I'd never prayed.</font>

864
01:26:30,744 --> 01:26:36,034
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I said "God, Son, Devil, whoever you are
up there, please have pity on me."</font>

865
01:26:36,165 --> 01:26:40,578
<font face="Trebuchet MS">"Please let me get this poor girl's body
out of this hotel room and into the ground</font>

866
01:26:40,711 --> 01:26:42,917
<font face="Trebuchet MS">so I don't have to spend
my life in prison."</font>

867
01:26:43,047 --> 01:26:48,337
<font face="Trebuchet MS">"And, God, if you'll do that for me, I'll
show you my appreciation by goin' home,</font>

868
01:26:49,427 --> 01:26:53,507
<font face="Trebuchet MS">gettin' on the methadone programme,
gettin' a job and livin' a virtuous life."</font>

869
01:26:56,684 --> 01:26:58,760
<font face="Trebuchet MS">We got out,</font>

870
01:26:58,894 --> 01:27:01,979
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and I promised, so here I am.</font>

871
01:27:03,315 --> 01:27:05,391
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Are you gonna stick with it for ever?</font>

872
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:10,609
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Well...</font>

873
01:27:11,489 --> 01:27:16,732
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You know, Dianne, for all the boredom the
straight life brings, it's not that bad.</font>

874
01:27:16,869 --> 01:27:19,787
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I mean, even this crummy
little room ain't so bad.</font>

875
01:27:19,914 --> 01:27:22,156
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I mean, I actually wake up some mornings</font>

876
01:27:22,291 --> 01:27:25,874
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and I feel like something good's
gonna happen today. You know?</font>

877
01:27:27,337 --> 01:27:31,169
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm a regular guy. I got my regular job.
I got my regular room.</font>

878
01:27:34,177 --> 01:27:36,632
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And now I got you.</font>

879
01:27:39,390 --> 01:27:41,015
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're crazy, Bob.</font>

880
01:27:41,892 --> 01:27:43,600
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You're really crazy.</font>

881
01:27:49,483 --> 01:27:51,855
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Dianne, why don't you go downstairs</font>

882
01:27:51,985 --> 01:27:56,196
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and tell your friends that you're
gonna spend the night, come back,</font>

883
01:27:56,322 --> 01:27:58,647
<font face="Trebuchet MS">and bed down with me for a little while?</font>

884
01:27:58,950 --> 01:28:01,156
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'd like to, Bob.</font>

885
01:28:01,285 --> 01:28:03,574
<font face="Trebuchet MS">But I got another old man now.</font>

886
01:28:04,872 --> 01:28:08,952
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm... I'm Rick's old lady now.
Ain't that a gas? I work for Rick.</font>

887
01:28:09,668 --> 01:28:14,495
<font face="Trebuchet MS">There we were, teaching that brat
to steal, and now I'm on his crew.</font>

888
01:28:15,382 --> 01:28:18,299
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Things sure can get
screwed around, can't they?</font>

889
01:28:19,510 --> 01:28:20,708
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Yeah.</font>

890
01:28:20,845 --> 01:28:22,968
<font face="Trebuchet MS">And, Bob, you know me.</font>

891
01:28:23,097 --> 01:28:26,680
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I might have been a lot of things,
but I never was a tramp.</font>

892
01:28:52,916 --> 01:28:55,454
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Bob, I gotta go.</font>

893
01:29:17,272 --> 01:29:19,311
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Hey, Dianne?</font>

894
01:29:21,568 --> 01:29:23,726
<font face="Trebuchet MS">It's really good to see you.</font>

895
01:29:23,861 --> 01:29:25,901
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I mean, you look really good.</font>

896
01:29:28,824 --> 01:29:31,695
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I wish I could win you back.</font>

897
01:31:20,344 --> 01:31:23,214
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Who is it?
- Tom, it's Bob. Open the door.</font>

898
01:31:26,433 --> 01:31:28,924
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Hey, what's this?
- It's a gift.</font>

899
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:32,227
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I won't be needing it. I got
my new programme down so...</font>

900
01:31:32,355 --> 01:31:34,762
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- A gift. Wow.
- Knock yourself out.</font>

901
01:31:34,899 --> 01:31:37,437
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- Mmmm...
- I don't know what's in there.</font>

902
01:31:37,568 --> 01:31:40,652
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Let's just see what's in there.</font>

903
01:31:46,535 --> 01:31:49,204
<font face="Trebuchet MS">God bless you, my son.
May you go to heaven.</font>

904
01:31:50,955 --> 01:31:52,236
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Now...</font>

905
01:31:52,373 --> 01:31:54,449
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Oh, yeah. This...</font>

906
01:31:55,167 --> 01:31:58,667
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This is for squares. Never touch the stuff.</font>

907
01:31:59,838 --> 01:32:01,878
<font face="Trebuchet MS">But this...</font>

908
01:32:05,218 --> 01:32:08,172
<font face="Trebuchet MS">A hundred sixteenths of Dilaudid.</font>

909
01:32:11,307 --> 01:32:15,008
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This should earn you an indulgence.</font>

910
01:32:34,037 --> 01:32:35,863
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Where's it at, Bob?</font>

911
01:32:37,665 --> 01:32:40,203
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- What do you want?
- We want your dope.</font>

912
01:32:40,334 --> 01:32:43,454
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You think if I had dope
I'd be sittin' in this flea trap?</font>

913
01:32:43,587 --> 01:32:47,287
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'm on a methadone programme. You
come around for dope? That's a laugh.</font>

914
01:32:47,424 --> 01:32:50,378
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Shut up. I ain't fucking, man.</font>

915
01:32:50,510 --> 01:32:54,804
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You want it the hard way and we're just
the guys who are gonna give it to you.</font>

916
01:32:54,931 --> 01:32:57,173
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Is that you, David?</font>

917
01:32:58,601 --> 01:33:01,637
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You listen to me, you little punk.
I'm goin' straight, man.</font>

918
01:33:01,771 --> 01:33:04,807
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I ain't fuckin' bullshitting you.
I'm goin' straight.</font>

919
01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:07,561
<font face="Trebuchet MS">You oughta try it sometime.
It's good for the soul.</font>

920
01:33:07,693 --> 01:33:09,685
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Fuckin' liar!</font>

921
01:33:09,820 --> 01:33:13,271
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Where is it, Bob? We know
this is all a scam you're playing.</font>

922
01:33:13,406 --> 01:33:16,075
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Where is it? Where the fuck is it?</font>

923
01:33:29,171 --> 01:33:33,120
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Nothing is more life-affirming than
getting the shit kicked out of you.</i></font>

924
01:33:33,258 --> 01:33:36,128
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>I knew it in my heart.
You can buck the system,</i></font>

925
01:33:36,261 --> 01:33:40,590
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>but you can't buck the dark forces
that lie hidden beneath the surface.</i></font>

926
01:33:40,723 --> 01:33:43,392
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>The ones some people
call superstitions.</i></font>

927
01:33:44,852 --> 01:33:46,595
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>Howling banshees.</i></font>

931
01:33:52,567 --> 01:33:56,612
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>So I relaxed and gave in to the notion
that, for the very first time in my life,</i></font>

932
01:33:56,738 --> 01:33:59,063
<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>I knew exactly what was
going to happen next.</i></font>

933
01:33:59,198 --> 01:34:03,030
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Fuck. Now I'm gonna
kill the son of a bitch.</font>

934
01:34:03,536 --> 01:34:09,159
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I bet ya the next bastard we capture
will tell us where it's at. So he's tough.</font>

935

<font face="Trebuchet MS"><i>They ain't all tough.</i></font>

936
01:34:16,172 --> 01:34:17,583
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I say kill him.</font>

937
01:34:19,717 --> 01:34:21,377
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Did you hear me, Bob?</font>

938
01:34:29,935 --> 01:34:32,391
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Come on. Let's go.</font>

939
01:35:16,311 --> 01:35:19,228
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Is he gonna make it?
Let me get him for a second.</font>

940
01:35:20,690 --> 01:35:23,359
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Bob. Can you hear me?</font>

941
01:35:25,194 --> 01:35:27,234
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Bob, who did this to you?</font>

942
01:35:27,697 --> 01:35:29,736
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Was it Trousinski?</font>

943
01:35:31,408 --> 01:35:33,448
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Bob, tell me. Who shot you?</font>

944
01:35:35,662 --> 01:35:37,571
<font face="Trebuchet MS">The hat.</font>

945
01:35:37,706 --> 01:35:40,375
<font face="Trebuchet MS">The hat? Bob, did you say "The Hat"?</font>

946
01:35:40,959 --> 01:35:42,998
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Tell Dianne...</font>

947
01:35:43,503 --> 01:35:46,373

948
01:35:46,506 --> 01:35:48,463
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- OK, Bob.
- OK?</font>

949
01:35:48,591 --> 01:35:51,082
<font face="Trebuchet MS">- So The Hat shot you. Right, Bob?
- No.</font>

950
01:35:53,887 --> 01:35:56,295
<font face="Trebuchet MS">The TV baby shot me.</font>

951
01:35:57,224 --> 01:35:59,631
<font face="Trebuchet MS">The TV Baby shot you
but The Hat was with him.</font>

952
01:35:59,768 --> 01:36:02,804
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Who's The Hat? You gotta
tell me so I can tell Dianne.</font>

953
01:36:08,526 --> 01:36:10,684
<font face="Trebuchet MS">Never mind.</font>

954
01:36:11,362 --> 01:36:13,817
<font face="Trebuchet MS">I'll tell her myself.</font>

955
