1
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,110
妈妈  杰斯罗在吃我的小内裤
Mom! Jethro's eating my underwear!

2
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,440
这里  猪猪  猪猪  杰斯罗
Here, piggy, piggy, piggy. Jethro.

3
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,450
妈  她发飙前没有一点儿迹象
Mom, before she starts, there isn't a shred of evidence

4
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,990
-也不说任何理由  -吉莉安  你儿子有病
- to support her allegations. - Gillian, your son is a psycho.

5
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:14,820
-他在我的吹风机上动手脚  -猜想不错啊  但是你不能证明
- He booby-trapped my hair dryer. - Nice hypothesis, but you can't prove it.

6
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,660
-的确不能  但是我能揍你  -妈  妈  该把她送到医院去
- Yeah, but I can hurt you. - Mom! Mom! She needs to be medicated.

7
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,090
-这里来  杰斯罗  -这里
- Come on, Jethro. - Come here.

8
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,240
我讨厌这家  这里来
I hate this family. Come here.

9
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,840
杰斯罗  你耽搁我们太多时间了
Jethro, you're getting a time out.

10
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,420
快点  背包
Come on, guys. Backpack.

11
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,320
-怎么  这是潮流  -这不合适  去换牛仔裤
- What? It's in style. - It's inappropriate. Go put on some jeans.

12
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,770
还有吐掉口香糖
And spit out the gum.

13
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,380
今天想穿什么颜色呢
So, what color do you want to wear today?

14
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,620
-红  蓝  紫
Red? Blue? Purple?

15
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,180
-粉色  妈咪  粉色
Pink, Momma, pink.

16
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,820
-法瑞恩  -怎么  不是你说的穿牛仔吗
- Farren. - What? You said jeans.

17
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,880
我是说合适你的衣服
I meant in your size.

18
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,060
快点  大家快点  我们不想迟到的
Come on, guys. Come on. We don't want to be late. There you go.

19
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,090
快点  甜心
Come on, sweetie.

20
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,400
-不  -出去
- No! - Get out!

21
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,540
不许打架
No fighting.

22
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,220
让我来
Allow me.

23
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,690
-我们还会一起吃饭吗  -我会去的
- Are we still on for dinner? - I'll be there.

24
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,290
有人在看
We have an audience.

25
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,230
- 呀  我想吐了  -他是个失败者
- Yuck. I'm going to vomit. - He is such a loser.

26
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,270
我喜欢鲍勃  他人很好
I like Bob. He's nice.

27
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,430
他是个无趣的卖笔的 每天都过一样的生活
He's a boring pen importer. He does the same routine every day.

28
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,410
-他就像个机器人  -因为他就是个机器人
- He's like a robot. - That's 'cause he is a robot.

29
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:14,380
来自未来的电子人  来毁灭人类的  从我们开始
A cyborg, sent from the future, to destroy humanity. Starting with us.

30
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,050
哇  三个月了  纪念日快乐
Well, it's been three months. Happy anniversary.

31
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,730
怎么了
What is it?

32
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,600
我必须告诉你我工作的事
I have to tell you about my job.

33
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,340
可能会吓到你
This might shock you,

34
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:44,240
但在关系进一步发展之前  你应该知道知道所有事情
but you should know everything before this relationship goes further.

35
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,940
-别  鲍勃  -怎么
- Don't, Bob. - What?

36
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,450
跟你在一起我很快乐
I'm very happy when I'm with you.

37
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,420
没有人像你一样可以让我开心地笑
No one has ever made me laugh like you do,

38
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,620
如果我是孤身一人  相信我们会有结果的
and if I were a single woman, I could see a real future for us.

39
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,690
但是现在是一揽子交易
But I'm a package deal.

40
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,190
什么意思
What do you mean?

41
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,020
孩子们是我优先考虑的事  我怎么能忽略他们呢
My kids are my priority and... How can I put this gently?

42
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,190
-他们讨厌我  -是啊
- They hate me. - Yeah.

43
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,640
-我可以让他们喜欢我  -明白吗
- I can make them like me. - See?

44
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,110
你不能让孩子们喜欢你  我的孩子不会  别人的孩子也不会
You can't make kids like you, not mine or anyone's.

45
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,110
我的孩子经历过很多
My kids have been through a lot, and...

46
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,480
在他们接受之前  我不认为我们该进一步发展
I don't think we should take the next step until they warm up to you.

47
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,320
你的幸福不重要吗
Doesn't your happiness count?

48
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,920
不好意思
Excuse me.

49
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,060
对不起  该走了  工作上的急事
Sorry, I gotta go. Emergency at work.

50
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,260
-没墨水了  -严重多了
- No ink? - It's much bigger.

51
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,000
-对不起  真的  -我明天跟你解释一切
Sorry, really. I will explain everything tomorrow.

52
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,500
好  明天见
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

53
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,460
-怎么这么久才到  -六分钟
- What took you so long to get here? - Six minutes.

54
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:15,190
-中途停下要了杯咖啡  -我知道了  你
- You stop for a latte? - I get it. You're...

55
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,600
-那句话怎么说来着  没事找事儿  -差不多
- What's the expression? Chopping my bust. - Close enough.

56
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,940
波尔达克和一些俄国佬  刚刚进了一个提炼厂
Poldark and a couple other Russkys just went in the refinery.

57
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,840
那我猜对了  他又在打歪主意了
Then I was right. He's planning something.

58
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,340
或许只是想免费搞点石油
Maybe they just want to fill up their gas tanks for free.

59
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,680
-不能责怪他们  -是啊  那个家伙太狡猾了
- I couldn't blame them. - No, that man's so crooked,

60
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,180
他若吃了钉子  能拉出螺丝
he could eat nails and poop corkscrews.

61
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,810
全世界就你最了解波尔达克
You're the world's foremost authority on Poldark.

62
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,250
你觉得他想干嘛
What do you think he's up to?

63
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,920
如果他的任务是破坏世界石油储备
If his mission is to sabotage the world's oil reserves,

64
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,090
他干嘛对像这样不值钱的精炼厂感兴趣
why would he care about some two-bit refinery like this one?

65
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,390
我保证给你机会亲自问他
I'll make sure you get a chance to ask him.

66
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,120
你丫怎么进去啊  坐火箭筒喷进去
How the heck are you going to get in there? A jet pack?

67
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,080
小菜一碟
It's in the shop.

68
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,370
等我信号
Wait for my signal.

69
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,040
好啊
Yuri.

70
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,240
-这是什么  -C4炸药
- What's this? - C-4.

71
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,680
弄完之后  把这地方炸掉
When we are done here, I want you to blow this place to smithereens.

72
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,320
快点  我可没时间跟你们耗  没有加班费
Hurry up. I don't have all day. There is no overtime here.

73
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,680
鲍勃·贺
Bob Ho.

74
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,000
我喜欢聊天  可这会儿没时间陪你
I would love to chat, but I gotta go.

75
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,050
-上面  快  快  -快
- Up there. Go, go, go, go. - Move it.

76
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,150
-快  -站住  都不许动
- Move. - Hold it. Stay where you are.

77
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,780
有趣啊  很好的有氧锻炼
That was fun. A good aerobic workout.

78
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,030
有机会真该再来一次
We should do this again sometime.

79
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,920
好了  波尔达克  走
Okay, Poldark, let's go.

80
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,860
你被逮捕了
We have suspect in custody.

81
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,740
伙计  你看到波尔达克的表情了吗
Did you see the look on Poldark's face, man?

82
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,680
干得好  鲍勃  难以置信
Brilliant work, Bob. Unbelievable.

83
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,680
我实在不想让你回去  你可是我最好的干将
I really hate to see you go home. You're the best agent I've ever had.

84
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,310
嘿  照顾下我的情绪好不好
Hey, you know I'm standing right here.

85
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,280
或许我该向你们国家申请多留你一段时间
Maybe I can get your government to loan you to me just a little bit longer.

86
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:30,220
别  这是我最后一桩任务  我退休了
No. This was my last assignment. I'm retiring.

87
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:36,300
-别告诉我是为了吉莉安  -我想过平凡的生活  想要结婚
- Don't tell me because of Gillian. - I want a normal life. I want to get married.

88
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,630
噢  伙计  别结婚啊
Oh, heck, man. Don't get married.

89
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,930
用不了几年你就会后悔
Just find some woman that you're going to hate in five years

90
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,970
到时候还要把房子留给人家
and give her your house.

91
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:47,730
这表送你了  留个纪念吧  中央情报局给你的
Keep the watch. A memento, compliments of the CIA.

92
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,680
吉莉安是住在你房子旁边的那女人吗
So, Gillian? Is that the woman that lives next door to your cover house?

93
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,650
-是啊  他们的关系可不一般啊  -我绝对不会为了一个女的放弃生活
- Yeah, they've been stepping out. - I could never give up this life for a woman.

94
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,910
伙计  我们是特工啊
We're spies, man.

95
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,650
每个男孩都想当特工  这才是生活
Every little boy wants to be a spy. It's the life.

96
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,380
很多时候你要独自坐在这样的小房子里
All the hours you spend sitting alone in a little room like this,

97
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,790
在盯梢货车后面吃冷掉的外带
eating cold take-out food in the back of a surveillance van,

98
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,420
随时都可能被击毙
getting shot at all the time,

99
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,090
学着一边坐车一边用个瓶子上小号
learning how to pee in a bottle in a moving vehicle.

100
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,400
-你的选择是正确的  -唯一的问题是  她的孩子讨厌我
- You're doing the right thing. - Only problem is that her kids hate me.

101
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,860
你真是条汉子
You the man.

102
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,530
真的会很想你  鲍勃  祝你跟那些孩子能合得来
Really gonna miss you, Ho. Good luck with those kids.

103
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,200
大反派我都搞定了  三个孩子能有多大能耐
I've brought down dictators. How tough can three kids be?

104
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,740
-下来  林戈  下来  -这里  猫咪  猫咪
- Come on, Ringo, come on. - Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

105
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,780
-林戈  -别担心  下来  下来
- Ringo! - Don't worry. Come on. Come on.

106
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,940
-下来  这里  -下来  林戈
- Come on. Right here. - Come on, Ringo.

107
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,550
-下来  林戈  -林戈
- Come on, Ringo. - Ringo.

108
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,880
嗨  孩子们
Hi, kids.

109
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,820
昨天丢下你一个人  很对不起
I'm sorry about running out last night.

110
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,120
-没关系  工作嘛  -不  这很不礼貌
- It's all right. It's your job. - No, it was rude.

111
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,830
我保证这样的事情不会再发生
I promise it will never happen again.

112
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,800
妈妈  林戈怎么办
Mom, what about Ringo?

113
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:57,340
甜心  我们什么都试过了  他想下来的时候会下来的
We've tried everything, sweetheart. He'll come down when he's ready.

114
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,840
想看我最近在忙什么吗
You want to see what I've been working on?

115
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,240
当然
Sure.

116
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:07,580
林戈林戈  下来  猫咪  我离你不远啊
Ringo, Ringo! Come on, kitty. It's not that far.

117
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,380
下来下来下来  林戈
Please, please, please, Ringo.

118
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,230
给你
There you go.

119
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,980
-你觉得怎样  -这个
- So, what do you think? - Well...

120
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,120
还没完成
It's a work-in-progress.

121
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,520
很可惜  今天没有一点时间来做这个东西
Sadly, I didn't have any time to work on it today.

122
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,950
猫上屋顶了啊  信号接收器又坏了啊
Cat was on the roof, satellite's broken again.

123
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,220
为了找个修理工  我花了两个小时
I spent two hours on hold trying to get a repairman out here,

124
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,490
而且昨晚的事还老在我脑子里面晃
and I can't stop thinking about last night.

125
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,960
那  我们可以吗
So, are we okay?

126
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,340
我明白
I understand.

127
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,640
如果我娶你  就要接受三个孩子
If a man marries you, he marries all four of you.

128
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,670
还有一只猪  一只猫和一只乌龟

吓到我了
It frightens me.

131
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:18,290
有的时候我觉得  我找到世界上最诚实的人了

你  看起来  比他好太多了
You're, like, so far above him.

136
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,520
她意思是他很无趣  土包子一个
What she means is he's boring. He's a geek.

137
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,590
他是个好男人  对我非常好
He's a very nice man who treats me very well.

138
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,490

- He's a pen importer. - He's a cyborg.

139
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,490
你们没有我了解他
You all don't know him like I do.

140
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,620
他对世界  对我的艺术都充满热情

我明白了  这就是你说的不无聊
I see what you mean about him not being boring.

143
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,230
你们认为的无聊  在我看来是可靠

For once, I'd like a man who goes to work every day at the same time,

145
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,910
每晚都回家的人
and who comes home every single night.

146
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:22,610
一个不撒谎  不骗人  不会像某人一样抛弃家人的
A man who doesn't lie, or cheat, or leave his family the first time some...

147
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,200
我的幸福也重要

他消失得就像戒酒聚会上的朗姆酒蛋糕
He's as gone as rum cake at an AA meeting.

153
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,030
我觉得整件事都是精心策划的
I'm telling you, this whole thing was a setup.

154
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,830
有人知道他要来
They knew he was coming.

155
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,400
你是说情报局里有内奸
Are you saying there's a mole in the agency?

156
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,310
我什么都没有说啊  除了他逃走了
I'm not saying anything except he got away.

让人抑郁的黑暗  无聊透顶  度日如年
The oppressive darkness and the torture of empty days stretching for years.

160
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:02,840
-牢房是地狱  -你在里面才呆四个小时
- Prison is hell. - You were in there for four hours.

And something to eat that does not come with a toy.

-一起来吧  -那是一定的
- You want to join us? - Absolutely!

168
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:34,270
因为我是个失败者  没有自己的生活
'Cause I'm a loser and I have no life.

169
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:37,780
我有没有说过我们要烤南瓜子吃
Did I mention we're going to toast the pumpkin seeds?

170

No, I'm not going to come downstairs right now. Get out.

175
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,560
法瑞恩  这是我的房子  你得听我的
Farren, this is my house. You will listen to me.

176

我又不归你管  出去  我说了  出去  吉莉安  出去
You don't own me. Get out. I said, get out, Gillian. Get out!

五分钟  下楼

No, she won't hear me. I'm on the roof.

180
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:20,420
在这个疯人院里  屋顶该是我唯一有隐私的地方了
It's like the only place I can get any privacy in this loony bin.

181
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,620
我绝对不可以让吉莉安跟那个家伙结婚
I can't let Gillian marry this guy.

182
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,760

No, it's not that. I mean, you're right, he is a total drone,

183
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,930
但不是这个问题
but that's not the issue.

184
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,940
我爸爸要是回来了怎么办
What's going to happen when my dad comes back?

185
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,870
他不会只是把我丢在这里  他会回来的
He won't just leave me here alone. He'll be back.

186
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:40,070
如果她结婚了  会发生什么  我不知道
And if she's married, what happens then? I don't know.

187

Force them? You know, you might as well try scratching your ear with your elbow.

193
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,290
你猜怎么了  波尔达克逃了
Guess what? Poldark escaped.

- No longer my problem. - Yeah, I know, but we recovered a file.

我们没办法破解  我想你可以看一下
We can't crack it. I thought maybe you could take a look at it.

嘿  如果能破  好极了  如果不能  没什么
Hey, if you can figure it out, great. If you can't, no harm, no foul.

This is my ticket to Coolsville.

251
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,160
这就是给我准备的衣服吗
This is what you bring me to wear?

252
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,490
是你自己说要时尚的
You said you wanted current.

253
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,090
我看起来就像是白俄罗斯里的法国王子
I look like the Fresh Prince of Belarus.

254
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,100
派人去给我搞套优雅的
Send someone out to get me something elegant.

255
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,700
这是什么程序
What is this program you found?

256
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,870
我在下载方程式
I went on to download the formula

257
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:09,140
结果发现网址被第三方侵入
and found the site being accessed by a third party.

258
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,710
如果被是美国或中国下载
If the United States or China has the formula,

259
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,240
他们就可以研究出抗体
they can develop an antibody for it.

260
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,750
正在追踪网络  但是网络被多重加密了
I'm tracing the ISP, but it's heavily encrypted.

261
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,040
要花点时间破解
It will take me a while to track it down.

262
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,810
不管是谁下载了我的方程式  给我找到
Find whoever downloaded my formula.

263
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,850
-找回方程式  -仅仅这样
- Retrieve it. - And?

264
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,390
-杀了他  -对了嘛
- Kill them. - Thank you.

265
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,560
-你要干吗  -我要杀了你
- What's up with you? - I'm gonna kill you.

266
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,670
什么  我要杀了你
What? I'm gonna kill you.

267
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,670
别打我  别打我  她在打我
Don't hurt me! Don't hurt me! She's hurting me!

268
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,740
嘿嘿嘿
Hey, hey, hey.

269
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,440
嘿  住手
Hey, stop!

270
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,950
-怎么了  -她往我房间扔臭弹
- What's going on here? - She threw a stink bomb in my room.

271
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,450
什么  不是我干的
What? That's so not true.

272
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:56,510
那你说是怎么回事  那就是我自己扔的喽
So what, you're saying I threw a stink bomb in my own room

273
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,320
只是为了陷害你  悲哀  真是悲哀
just to get you in trouble? Sad. So sad.

274
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,090
嘿  嘿  嘿
Hey, hey, hey.

275
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,420
法瑞恩  我对你很失望
Farren, I'm very disappointed in you.

276
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,730
你们现在该睡觉了
You two should be in bed by now.

277
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,430
是这样的  如果我们能够及时完成作业  吉莉安允许我们呆到深夜
Well, if we finish our homework in time, Gillian lets us stay up till midnight.

278
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:18,480
她也喜欢让我们看《午夜剧场》  这是我们的传统
She also likes us to watch Adult Swim. It's kind of a tradition.

279
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,210
真是想不通
I didn't really think this one through.

280
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:35,120
诺拉  准备睡觉了
Nora, let's get ready for bed.

281
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:37,520
我不想睡觉
I don't want to go to bed.

282
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:45,000
只有妈咪可以给我穿衣服
Only my mommy can dress me.

283
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,770
诺拉
Nora.

284
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,510

Here I come.

285
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:56,650
嘿  回来  我要抓到你
Hey! Come back. I'll get you.

286
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,350

287
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,880

288
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,720

Nora.

289
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,790

00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,000
-只有妈咪可以给我穿衣服  -不要啦  诺拉
- Only my mommy can dress me. - Come on, Nora.

292

You.

294
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,390
你妈咪可以做到吗  睡觉
Can your mommy do that? Sleep.

295
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,680
滚出去
Get out!

296
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:13,220
-喂  -你还活着  好迹象
- Hello? - You're alive. That's a good sign.

297
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:17,720
-孩子们怎样  -我们都很好  很简单嘛
- How are the kids? - We had a great night. Easy as pie.

298
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:21,360
真的吗  你是在跟我的孩子在一起吧
Really? You're with my kids, right?

299
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:25,600
鲍勃  那天晚餐
Bob, the other night at dinner,

300
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:29,570
你要说你工作的事  我打断了
you were gonna say something about your job, and I cut you off.

301
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,370
现在想告诉我吗
You want to tell me now?

302
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:36,010
可以等你回来再说
It can wait until you get back.

303
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:42,550
-我打心眼儿觉得这建议好  -我保证最坏的都过去了
- I really think this was a good idea. - I'm sure the worst is behind us.

304
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,480
马上就好
Just a second.

305
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,830
我来
I got it.

这下糟了
Big mistake.

308
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,720
一切都没有问题  燕麦好了
Everything will be fine. Oatmeal's ready.

309
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,350
小刺儿头  今天没轮到你
- Shotgun. - It's not your day.

310
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,960
你确定你妈妈允许你穿成这样上学
You sure your mother lets you go to school like that?

311
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,290
要你管
Duh, Bob.

312
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,590
“要你管”
"Duh, Bob."

313

316
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,320

00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,530
-你编的  -绝对是编的
- You're full of it. - Yeah, full of it.

我跟你说  我昨天才下载下来
I'm telling you, I downloaded it yesterday.

319
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,570

Really? 'Cause if you really had, that'd be pretty cool.

00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,340
-是啊  酷毙了  -我们听听
- Yeah, pretty cool. - Let's hear it then.

321
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,740
你要爆掉我们的耳朵是吧  这只是一堆乱七八糟的静电在闪
You trying to pop our ears? That's nothing but a bunch of static.

322
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,320
-我不懂  -我懂
- I don't get it. - I get it.

323
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,390
你是个可悲的书呆子  骗子  干掉他
You're a pathetic little nerd and a liar. Let's get him.

324
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,520
维基
Wedgie!

325
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:05,600
放我下来  放我下来  放我下来  放我下来
Put me down! Put me down! Put me down! Put me down!

326
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,560
好啊  这可是你说的
Okay, you asked for it.

327
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:14,330
不  你们将会受到我和我律师的指控
No! You guys are gonna hear from me and my lawyer.

328
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:18,300
你们会付出代价  每个人
You'll pay for this, each and every one of you.

329
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,320
跟我说说万圣节吧
So, tell me more about Halloween.

330
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,050
最好的就是它了 我们可以得到糖果
It's the best. You get candy.

331
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:37,120
每个人都装扮成别人  没有知道你真正是谁
Everyone pretends to be someone else, and nobody knows who you really are.

332
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:40,290
听起来很熟悉  诺拉
Sounds familiar. Nora...

333
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:45,400
那么  你想扮什么  科学怪人  僵尸

00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,210
诺拉  以后不要再到处跑了

352
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,640
对不起  鲍勃

我们去付钱吧

喂  我是鲍勃
Yo, it's Ho.

355
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,930
在我来之前  让他呆在那里
Just hold him till I get there.

356
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,170
我能否在开始前明确  在美国公立学校的体制下
Can I just say before we begin that only in the current distressed condition

357
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,640
这极其让人忧心的状况里
of the American public school system

358
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:42,540
被头部朝下栽进垃圾桶中的人是我
could I be deposited headfirst into a garbage can,

359
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:46,520
难道被迫接受惩罚也应该是我吗
and yet I'm the one who winds up receiving disciplinary action?

360
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,520
你到底是谁
Who exactly are you?

361
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,480
我是他母亲的
I'm his mother's...

362
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,420
-邻居  -邻居

我负责照看他们几天

364
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,460
这不是伊恩第一次惹麻烦了
Well, this is not the first time lan has been in trouble.

365
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,430
他打架  撒谎
He gets in fights. He lies.

366
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,500
嘿  我没撒谎
Hey, I don't lie.

367
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,900
你告诉所有人  你邀请了赛琳娜·戈麦斯来春季舞会
You told everyone you invited Selena Gomez to the spring dance.

368
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,110
她的出场费是一大难题
Her appearance fee was an obstacle.

369
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:13,770
你说你在花花公子公寓度过了新年前夜
You said you spent New Year's Eve at the Playboy Mansion.

370
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:17,180

Hey, pay-per-view high-def. I felt like I was there.

我警告你  撒谎是很危险的
I'm telling you, lying is a dangerous game.

372
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,790

Bob, you sell pens. What do you...

373
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:31,230

- Oh, no. That's them. - Who?

374
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:34,230
把我丢进垃圾桶的未来蛇头
The future felons who put me in the trash can.

375
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,770
嘿  蠢蛋  我们因为你被留堂了
Hey, geek-boy, we got detention because of you.

You wish. He's my bodyguard. I hired him. You better watch out.

379
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:51,740
-真的  -不是  他开玩笑呢
- That true? - No. He's joking.

380
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:55,320
-我是他们的保姆  -你又能把我们怎么样
- I'm their babysitter. - What are you gonna do?

381
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:58,750
礼貌地请你让我们过去
Ask you politely to allow us to pass.

382
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:14,270
真丢人  你为什么就不做点什么呢
How humiliating. Why didn't you do something?

383
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:17,810
干嘛告诉他们我是你的保镖
Why did you tell them I was your bodyguard?

384
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,640
你说对了  确实很不像
You're right. I guess it was too big a stretch.

385
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:37,460
嘿  你怎么样  我是伊恩
Hey. How you doing? I'm lan.

386
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,360
如果我说  你有极其美丽的身体  你会过来深情地抱着我吗
If I told you, you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me?

387
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:48,600
-至少你不害羞  -我想用最坏的方式跟她说话
- At least you're not shy. - I wanted to talk to her in the worst way.

388
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,670
任务完成了
Mission accomplished.

389
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,200
这里来
Come here.

390
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,050
你真漂亮
You look so pretty.

391
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,720
法瑞恩  我不知道你是练体操的
Farren, I didn't know you did gymnastics.

392
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,620
为什么要知道  你不知道我的任何事
Why would you? You don't know anything about me.

393
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:13,060
你只知道跟吉莉安出去鬼混  对我们理都不理
You come over to hang out with Gillian, and you never even talk to us.

394
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,390
来  我们走
Come on, let's go.

395
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,070
这婆娘说到重点了
The woman's got a point.

396
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:30,650
我不知道你们派谁出去买的衣服  我只知道我想杀了他们
I don't know who you are sending out to buy my clothes, but I want them killed.

397
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:36,720
-自己去啊  -我是全美国通缉的人
- You could go yourself. - I'm the most wanted man in America.

398
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:40,490
我没办法看到百货公司的货架
I cannot exactly browse the racks of JCPenneys.

399
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:45,020
只是给我一些能融入社会的东西就好  一些很有美国风的
Just give me something that will blend in. Something extremely American.

400
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:48,260
先生  我们可以进行试验了
Sir, we are ready to run the test.

401
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,930
棒极了
Magnificent.

402
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:32,040
她的鞋子一定有塑料成分  细菌会吃掉所有的石油制品
She must have plastic in her shoes. It will eat any petroleum product.

403
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:37,180
我们正在改善这一点
We're working on that.

404
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,010
细菌呢
What happened to the bacteria?

405
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,650
细菌完全靠石油生存  石油没了  细菌就死了
They live as long as they feed. Once the oil is gone, they disappear.

406
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,730
我的名鞋也没了
Just like my Jimmy Choos.

407
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,100
进来
Come in.

408
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,840
听我说  今天
Listen, about today...

409
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:10,240
你本该为我出头的  知道吗  我必须面对这些混蛋
You could have stood up for me, you know. I have to face those guys.

410
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,980
那就面对他们
So face them.

411
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,210
除非你一辈子都想在
Unless you want to spend the rest of your life

412
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,380
欺辱中度过
with your head in the trash can.

413
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:20,250
谢谢你的建议  鲍勃  所有问题都解决了[反语]
Thanks for the advice, Bob. All my problems are solved.

414
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,570
这是你们中学的作业
They assign this in middle school?

415
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,930
不是  业余爱好而已
No, that's my pleasure reading.

416
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,080
你很有天赋
You're smart.

417
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:42,670
你有很多擅长的事  为什么要把事情搞砸呢
You have a lot going for you. Why do you make things up?

418
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,810
女生不会对天文学感兴趣
Girls aren't exactly impressed by astrophysics.

419
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:50,010
只要给我原材料  我就能设计  制作还有发射火箭
Given the resources, I could design, build and launch a rocket

420
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,920
火箭能够精确地环绕月球
that would accurately circumscribe an orbit of the moon.

421
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:58,790
但是其他男生  能够玩儿花式投篮
But other guys can, you know, throw a ball through a hoop.

422
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,770
我不想让你陷入麻烦
I don't want you to get in trouble.

423
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,940
我们来一个约定吧
I'll make you a deal.

424
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,300
如果从现在开始说实话
If you try to tell the truth from now on,

425
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:10,380
我不会跟你妈妈说今天的事
I won't tell your mother about today.

426
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,740
真的吗
Really?

427
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,810
伙计  这可真酷
Dude, that's almost cool.

428
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,780
你说像我这样卖钢笔的
You mean for a guy who sells pens?

429
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,420
好了  孩子们  该睡觉了
Come on, kids, time for bed.

430
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,980
来  多吃一口
Come on, one more spoonful.

431
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,580
诺拉
Nora.

432
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:17,400
这首歌是我小时候在中国学的
This one I learned it in China when I was young.

433
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:07,190
是我  我需要帮助
It's me. I need your help.

434
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:22,200
我撒了天大的慌才搞到这些东西
I had to make up one heck of a yarn to get all this stuff.

435
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:23,570
你怎么跟他们说的
What did you tell them?

436
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,740
我就说如果明早以前找不出武器级铀
Well, let's just say if I don't find some weapons-grade uranium by dawn,

437
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:29,780
我就有麻烦了  你要这些干什么
I'm in trouble. What do you need all this for?

438
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,250
帮孩子们做家庭作业
To get the kids ready for school.

439
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:36,220
呵呵  就像我妈妈在东柏林的时候  经常说的一样
Well, it's like my mom always used to say when she was stationed over in East Berlin.

440
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,220
她说  “当间谍容易  做父母难啊”  祝你好运
She'd say, "Spying is easy. Parenting is hard." Good luck.

441
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,010
好极了
Bring it on.

442
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,640
法瑞恩  你已经在里面呆了一个早上了  让我进去
Farren, you've been in there all morning! Let me in!

443
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,910
法瑞恩  让我进去
Farren, let me in.

444
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,680
法瑞恩  让我进去
Farren, let me in.

445
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:14,080
法瑞恩  你已经在里面带了一个早上了  让我进去
Farren, you've been in there all morning! Let me in!

446
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,350
法瑞恩
Farren.

447
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,250
嘿
Hey!

448
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,230
该轮到我了吧
I guess it's my turn.

449
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:25,600
法瑞恩  换一条长一点的裙子
And, Farren, please put on a longer skirt.

450
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,270
你这是在挑衅我
This means war.

451
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:49,920
诺拉
Nora?

452
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,200
诺拉
Nora.

453
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,950
跟鲍勃在一起
Stay with Bob.

454
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,750
走吧  诺拉
Come on, Nora.

455
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,720
-他在哪里  -藏起来了吧
- Where is he? - Hiding.

456
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:56,620
他可能要使花招骗我们开门
He's probably going to trick us into opening the door.

457
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:58,560
帮我把东西放下来
Help me put this away?

458
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:13,340
伊恩  你知道规定
Lan. You know the rules.

459
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:16,040
不能在楼上喝汽水
No soda upstairs.

460
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:17,780
什么  你怎么
What? How did you...

461
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:42,400
早餐好了
Breakfast is served.

462
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:45,370
哇
Wow!

463
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:48,810
诺拉  该睡觉了
Nora, time for bed.

464
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,890
睡觉了
Night-night.

465
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:08,830
明天还要上学  该睡觉了
It's a school night. You should be asleep.

466
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:10,930
你怎么找到我的
How'd you find me?

467
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,590
第六感吧
Call it a hunch.

468
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,120
你为什么你对妈妈直呼其名呢
Why do you call your mother Gillian instead of Mom?

469
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:31,810
她不是我妈妈
She's not my mom.

470
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,420
什么意思
What do you mean?

471
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:36,860
我爸爸以前结过婚
My father was married before,

472
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,020
我的妈妈在我小时候就死了
and my real mom died when I was little.

473
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:40,830
吉莉安是继母而已
Gillian is just my stepmother.

474
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:43,920
伊恩和诺拉是我同父异母的弟弟妹妹
And lan and Nora are just my half brother and sister.

475
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,400
我就像家里的怪人
I'm like the freak of the family.

476
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:49,840
他的离开一定让你很伤心
It must have hurt your feelings when he left.

477
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:51,700
他会回来看我的
He'll be back for me.

478
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,770
我知道他不是世界上最好的父亲
I know he's not the greatest dad in the world,

479
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,470
但是他爱我  会回来看我
but he loves me, and he's not going to leave me here alone.

480
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,750
无论如何
Anyway,

481
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:07,920
你不该爬到屋顶上来  不安全
you should not climb the roof like this. It's not safe.

482
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:10,290
别告诉我不可以呆在这里
Please don't tell me I can't come up here.

483
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,590
这是我唯一一个可以冷静的地方了
It's like the only place I can chill.

484
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:16,100
事实上  我是想问  能不能让我给你修一个栅栏
Actually, I was going to offer to build you a railing.

485
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:20,000
你是想讨好我  让我喜欢你是吧
Are you trying to bribe me into liking you?

486
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,160
我只是想要你安全
I just want you to be safe.

487
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,740
介不介意我跟你一起冷静
Mind if I chill with you?

488
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:33,110
没问题啊
It's a free country.

489
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,650
看  星星
Look at the star.

490
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,970
好消息  我们知道  方程式是在哪里被下载的了
Good news. We got an address.

491
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:09,190
好样儿的  叫上点儿人  把方程式拿回来
Good. Take some men. Get that download back.

492
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,450
塔蒂安娜
Tatiana.

493
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,250
要赶尽杀绝
No survivors.

494
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:20,560
嘿  老板  喜欢不
Hey, boss. You like?

495
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,960
不喜欢
No like?

496
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:38,280
我能给一点时尚建议吗
May I make a couple of fashion suggestions?

497
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:43,080
女人不喜欢衬衫压在里面  把头发弄乱
Women don't like the shirt tucked in. Mess up your hair.

498
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:47,660
-你懂时尚  -不  但我懂女人
- You know about fashion? - No, but I know women.

499
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:53,190
像这样穿  我在电影里看过
Wear it like this. It's cool, I saw it in a movie.

500
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,030
什么电影  《八爪女》  现在可不是1985年
What movie? Octopussy? This isn't 1985.

501
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:01,300
-差点儿忘了  -这是什么
- I almost forgot. - What's this?

502
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:05,010
-伊基·波普和大卫·鲍伊在上海的演唱会  -什么
- Iggy Pop and David Bowie in Shanghai. - What?

503
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:08,600
这大概是世界上最难找到的演唱会碟片了
This is only about the hardest concert to find in the world.

504
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:11,840
我保证学校里没有谁有
I guarantee no one else in the school district has it.

505
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:15,580
-你为我下载的  -别担心  我付钱了
- You downloaded this for me? - Don't worry, I paid for it.

506
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:19,120
-你知道有这个演唱会都不可能啊  怎么做到的  -简单  我就在现场
- How'd you even know about it? - Easy. I was there.

507
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:32,130
鲍勃  你太有效率了 我们提前半个小时到了
Bob, you're getting too efficient. We're half an hour early.

508
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,730
不用谢
You're welcome.

509
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:37,770
今天开心哦
Have a great day.

510
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,610
-嘿  酷啊  艾伦  -谢谢  我是伊恩
- Hey, cool look, Aaron. - Thanks. It's lan.

511
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:47,380
管他的
Whatever.

512
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:15,200
今天要愉快哦
Have a great day.

513
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:20,140
听着  昨天在屋顶说了话  不代表我们就是朋友了
Look, the talk on the roof the other night doesn't mean we're friends.

514
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,550
但愿不会
God forbid.

515
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,710
找到了  没有人在
We're here. There is nobody around.

516
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:50,750
我发现电脑了  但是数据被下载到移动盘了
I found the computer, but the file was downloaded to an external storage device.

517
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,710
我找不到
I can't find that.

518
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:58,150
我想我知道谁住在这里了
I think I just figured out who lives here.

519
00:49:58,460 --> 00:49:59,920
中央情报员鲍勃
Agent Ho.

520
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:15,770
-喂  -你不能再随便爆东西了  安东沙
- Hello. - You must stop shooting things, Antosha.

521
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:19,370
我说过  中央情报局  或者中国人拿到就糟了
I said it would be bad if the CIA or Chinese had it.

522
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:24,180
但他两个都是  找到他  但是要活的
But he's both. Find him, but keep him alive.

523
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:27,820
我需要知道他还把这个给谁看了
I need to know who else he's shown this to.

524
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:36,930
听着  现在  所有人
Listen up. Now. Everyone in here.

525
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:43,290
我们必须盯住中央情报员鲍勃
We must locate Chinese Intelligence agent, Bob Ho.

526
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:49,700
他很狡猾  是最出色的特工  而且神出鬼没
He is very tricky. The best at what he does. He won't be easy to find.

527
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,400
-克里尔小姐  -等会儿
- Ms. Creel. - Not now.

528
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:56,280
想象你是个训练有素的中国人  又想消失
Imagine you are Chinese, highly trained, and you want to disappear.

529
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:59,280
我看到他挽着一条挂满骷髅的绳子在爬
I see him climbing with a bunch of skulls on a rope.

530
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:03,580
他不是野蛮人  但这样想也不错
Okay, he's not Conan the Barbarian. Good try, though.

531
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:05,450
不是  是我看到他了  在那里
No, I see him. There.

532
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:12,090
上  上
Go. Go!

533
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:18,230
先别杀他  我们还需要他的情报
Don't kill him yet. We need information.

534
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:33,950
加油鲍勃  加油鲍勃 加油鲍勃  加油鲍勃  加油鲍勃
Go, Bob, go! Go, Bob, go! Go, Bob, go!

535
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:37,220
过来  小甜心  回来
Come here, sweetheart. Get back here.

536
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:41,880
过来
Come here!

537
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,700
放手
Let go!

538
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:57,300
-搞定这个坏女人  鲍勃  -放手
- Get the bad lady, Bob. - Let go!

539
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,340
-能帮我拿好乌龟吗  -一会儿再说
- Can you hold my turtle? - Not now.

540
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,380
耶  鲍勃
Yay, Bob!

541
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:12,180
就这样
That's it.

542
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:14,050
你要付出代价
You will pay for that,

543
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,090
-美国小公主  -救命  鲍勃
- little American princess. - Bob, help!

544
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:34,640
还要  还要  还要
Again, again, again.

545
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:37,980
好
Okay.

546
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,080
-你为什么让我们离开学校  -谁在乎  我们出来了
- Why did you pull us out of school? - Who cares? We're out.

547
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:49,160
那你怎么在前座呢  今天该我
Why are you in the front seat anyway? It's my day.

548
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:52,290
-不是  该我  -不是  不该你  你撒谎
- No, it isn't. It's my day. - No, it's not your day. You're the liar.

549
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,530
-不是  今天该我  -不是  今天该我
- No, today is my day. - No, today is my day.

550
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,120
-你撒谎  -没有没有没有
- You're a liar. - No. No. No.

551
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,100
-好了  安静  -我还是很饿
- All right, quiet! - I'm still hungry.

552
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:13,050
看起来这里没有嫩鸡吃
It doesn't look like they have chicken tenders here.

553
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:16,250
里面等我  我要打一个电话
Wait inside. I have to make a call.

554
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:27,920
-我是菲尔弗莱  -我是鲍勃  我需要帮助
- This is Firefly. - This is Bob Ho. I need help.

555
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:33,300
我在大学拿到了很好的成绩
Yeah, so I get pretty good grades at this university.

556
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:37,140
是优等生  我不想吹嘘  但是  你知道的
I'm top of the class. I don't like to brag, but, you know.

557
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:40,270
-鲍勃  这是拉瑞  -先生  很高兴见到你
- Bob, this is Larry. - Pleased to meet you, sir.

558
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:43,070
-我们去吃东西吧  -拉瑞上大学了
- Let's get some food. - He goes to the university.

559
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,270
他是个诗人  是不是很酷
He's a poet. Isn't it cool?

560
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:54,150
好极了  帅呆了  酷毙了  衰死了
It's rad. It's awesome. It's jiggy for shizzy. It's the bomb.

561
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:57,550
-进去  -嘿
- Let's go. - Hey!

562
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,760
真尴尬
How embarrassing.

563
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:05,100
要知道  很多人第一次见到我都不喜欢我
You know, most people don't like me when they first meet me.

564
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,600
但是拉瑞不是
But Larry did.

565
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:12,670
我有两个词要说  拉瑞  杯具
I have two words for you, Larry. Thirteen.

566
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:31,600
我要尿尿
I have to go.

567
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:37,520
好  诺拉  我们走  你们俩就呆在这里
All right, Nora. Come on. You two stay at the table.

568
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:42,630
不不不
No, no, no.

569
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:45,540
我不能进去
I can't go in there.

570
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:58,040
男孩们真脏
Boys are pigs.

571
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:03,850
小心
Careful.

572
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,110
然后狮子跳到我头上  我赤手空拳干掉了它
And the lion jumped on me, and I killed him with my bare hands,

573
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:18,900
救了上校妻子的性命
and I saved the colonel's life.

574
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:20,980
-你好勇敢  -谢谢
- You're brave. - Thanks.

575
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:26,980
这个如何呢  鲍勃  整个店的服务生都让拉瑞坐这里
How about this, Bob? The whole restaurant and the waitress sat Larry here.

576
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:30,050
-不是很棒吗  -像是命中注定
- Isn't it great? - It's like it's fate or something.

577
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:32,380
是啊  先生  我们只是闲聊一下
Really, sir, we're just goofing around.

578
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:35,190
-嘿  诺拉  当当当  -是谁敲门
- Hey, Nora. Knock, knock. - Who's there?

579
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,960
-爱尔兰炖肉  -什么爱尔兰炖肉
- Irish stew. - Irish stew who?

580
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,690
如假包换的爱尔兰炖肉
Irish stew in the name of the law.

581
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:47,000
拉瑞在跟我说在大学里的事  听起来棒极了
Larry was telling me all about the university. It sounds great.

582
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:50,070
-很高兴什么时候带你转一圈  -不可能
- I'd be glad to give you a tour sometime. - When pigs fly.

583
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:52,010
这不由你决定  你又不是我爸
It's not up to you. You're not my dad.

584
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:56,140
我不是  但是我知道  你妈妈也不会失去神智让你去
No, but I know that your mother hasn't completely lost her mind.

585
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:57,710
鲍勃  只是转一下
It's just a tour, Bob.

586
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:00,750
又不是在约会
It's not like he's asking me out on a date or anything.

587
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:02,050
是吗
Are you?

588
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:05,450
不是  只是一个友善的邀请
No, it's just a friendly offer.

589
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:08,720
即使是约会  你也不能拦我
Even if it was a date, you still couldn't stop me.

590
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:17,060
-你的专业是什么  拉瑞  -英国文学
- What's your major, Larry? - English Lit.

591
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,660
把酱油递给我好吗
Would you pass the soy sauce?

592
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:23,640
学习文学经典让我受益匪浅
That way I get a background in the classics.

593
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:33,080
-你说俄语  是吧  -怎么了
- You speak Russian, Larry? - What's going on?

594
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:56,170
-这会很痛  -你说得对极了
- This is going to be painful. - You're right about that.

595
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:01,280
走  走  走
Go, go, go.

596
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:11,380
或许你该就这件事写一首诗
Maybe you'll write a poem about this.

597
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,270
再见了  拉瑞
Goodbye, Larry.

598
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,280
还是算了  对我来说他太老了
Fine. He's too old for me.

599
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:44,380
鲍勃  我不想当公主了  我想当电子人
Bob, I don't want to be a princess anymore. I want to be a cyborg.

600
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,950
他怎么这么快找到我们的  这说不通啊
How did he find us so fast? It doesn't make sense.

601
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:50,860
-鲍勃  发生什么事了  -安静  让我想一想
- Bob, what's going on? - Please quiet, I'm trying to think.

602
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,290
什么意思  你说你要想一想
What do you mean, you're trying to think?

603
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,230
-你刚刚把一个人扔到窗外去了  -他是谁  他怎么
- You just threw a man out the window... - Who is he? What is...

604
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:57,670
好了好了  够了
All right, all right, fine. Fine.

605
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:03,400
我是个国际间谍  被中国情报局派到美国中央情报局
I am international spy, on loan to the CIA from the Chinese Intelligence Service.

606
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:08,000
有人想置我于死地  拉瑞是俄国探员  清楚了吧
Someone wants me dead, and "Larry" was a Russian operative, okay?

607
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:10,310
好了  别说了
Fine. Don't tell us.

608
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:13,180
酷
Cool.

609
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:20,520
他为什么一个人来
Why would he come alone?

610
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,460
呆在这里
Stay here.

611
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,720
-孩子们呢  -里面
- Where are the kids? - Inside.

612
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:31,860
只要孩子安全  其他的没有什么
Nothing else matters until these kids are safe. Nothing.

613
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:35,410
是啊  卡尔顿应你的要求  给孩子们建了安全屋
Of course. Colton set up that safe house for them like you requested.

614
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:39,070
-嘿  文件带了吗  -什么文件
- Hey, got that file on you? - What file?

615
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:42,310
波尔达克电脑上的  卡尔顿发给了你  你下载过
The one Colton linked you to, from Poldark's computer, your download.

616
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:45,470
我没有下载  打都没打开过
I didn't download it. I never even got it open.

617
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:48,910
别跟我绕弯弯  鲍勃  那可是绝密文件  我需要所有的拷贝
Don't BS me, Bob. It's classified material. I need all copies.

618
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:50,950
为什么说是我下载的呢
Why would you think I downloaded it?

619
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:54,250
除非有人告诉你了
Unless someone told you I had, someone who wanted it back.

620
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,450
别让事情麻烦了
Let's not make this thing harder than it has to be, Bob.

621
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,220
给我
Give me the file.

622
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:00,890
你可是国家公务人员  怎么能做这种事
You're a career officer. Why do this?

623
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,690
我想退出  跟你一样  我们都是为了爱
I want out. Same as you. We're both leaving for love.

624
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:07,170
只不过我爱钱  而波尔达克能给我钱  文件
Only I love money and Anton Poldark is match. Com. The file.

625
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,210
等一下  等等
Wait. Take it easy.

626
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:21,150
好样儿的
Good work.

627
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:22,550
哦
No.

628
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:32,050
我只能说  你是目前  我妈找过的最酷的男朋友
Can I just say, you are by far the coolest guy my mom has ever dated.

629
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:36,830
至少我知道了  拉瑞怎么这么快发现我们的了
At least now I know how that kid Larry found us so fast.

630
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:38,490
-怎么  -手表
- How? - The watch.

631
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:43,060
格雷兹让我留着手表  这一定是个跟踪系统
Glaze told me to keep the watch. It must have a tracking device.

632
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:49,600
-哇  你真的是个特工  -吉莉安绝对要疯掉
- Wow. You really are a spy. - Gillian is totally going to freak.

633
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:13,500
这是干什么
What are you doing?

634
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:17,830
石头里有铁矿  能屏蔽信号  表给我
There's iron in these rocks. It will hide the signal. Watch, please.

635
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:21,080
把今天的事告诉学校的任何一个人
You realize if I told anyone at school this story,

636
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:23,940
都会因为撒谎被留堂一年
I'd get detention for a year for lying.

637
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:33,750
-嗯  -嘿  兄弟  你在干嘛
- Yes. - Hey, partner. Where're you at?

638
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:39,120
-想干嘛  -我想要发给你的那个文件
- Why do you ask? - I needed to pick up that file I sent you.

639
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:41,460
你知道的  我想让你帮我破解的那个
You know, the one I wanted you to open for me.

640
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,830
鲍勃  你在吗
Bob, you there?

641
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:50,130
卡尔顿  我从来没有想过你会背叛我们  投向卡尔波特
Colton, I never thought you would have sold out to Poldark.

642
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:54,800
嘿  这什么想法  有些事不太对头  我们该聚一下讨论讨论
Hey, that's crazy, man. Something's wrong. We need to get together and talk.

643
01:00:55,810 --> 01:00:59,510
-休想  -鲍勃  鲍勃
- Nice try. - Bob? Bob?

644
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:11,630
-在宾馆  我们会很安全  -这就是你的计划是吧  把我们丢在宾馆
- We'll be safe here. I promise. - This is your plan? Hide out in a hotel?

645
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,490
这儿也不像是有嫩鸡
Doesn't look like they have chicken tenders here, either.

646
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:35,610
好棒  我们能定房间服务吗
This is awesome. Can we order room service?

647
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,210
-你疯了吗  我要回家  -不行
- Are you crazy? I'm going home. - No.

648
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:42,050
-这是你们跟我在一起唯一安全的地方  -跟你一起安全
- The only place you're safe is with me. - Safe with you?

649
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,650
-每个人都想杀了你  -我知道  这很酷
- Everybody's trying to kill you. - I know. Isn't it cool?

650
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:50,430
嘿  鲍勃  如果你想跟我妈妈结婚  我给你写请帖
Hey, Bob, if you want to marry my mom, I'll personally write the invitations.

651
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,360
爱你  鲍勃
Love you, Bob.

652
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:37,740
现实点儿  鲍勃
Be realistic, Bob.

653
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:44,250
-喂  -嗨  吉莉安
- Hello. - Hi, Gillian.

654
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,080
嗨  小甜心
Hi, sweetheart.

655
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:48,660
外公刚刚睡着了  我正要跟你们打电话呢
Yeah, Grandpa just fell asleep. I was gonna call you guys.

656
01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:51,820
我必须跟你说个事儿
I have to tell you something.

657
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:55,190
我知道这会伤害你  但是我还是要说
I know this is going to hurt you, but I have to tell you.

658
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:57,820
-你还好吧  -我没事
- Are you all right? - I'm fine.

659
01:02:58,670 --> 01:03:01,190
-关于鲍勃  -他怎么了
- It's about Bob. - What about him?

660
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:04,870
他不是你想象的那样  他是个特工  中国特工
He's not who you think he is. He's a spy, a Chinese spy.

661
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,800
现在恐怖分子想干掉他
And these terrorists are trying to kill him

662
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,340
情报局也想找到他  他们
and now the CIA's after him, too, and they...

663
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:11,900
法瑞恩  我知道你不喜欢鲍勃  但是别这样啊
Farren, I know you don't like Bob, but come on.

664
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:14,540
我以为会是伊恩这样做  没想到会是你
I'd expect this from lan, but not from you.

665
01:03:14,650 --> 01:03:18,750
什么  不  这是真的  他会让我们都完蛋的  你就一点儿也不在乎吗
What? No, it's true. He's going to get us all killed. Don't you even care?

666
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:22,090
法瑞恩  谈话结束了  让鲍勃接电话
Farren, this conversation is over. Put Bob on.

667
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:31,230
嗨  吉莉安
Hi, Gillian.

668
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:34,600
鲍勃  对不起  我不知道她是怎么了
Bob, I am so sorry. I don't know what's gotten into her.

669
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:38,670
-真的  -什么
- It's true. - What is?

670
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,640
她说的都是真的
Everything she said is all true.

671
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:45,580
不管这是什么鬼  这不搞笑
Whatever this is, it isn't funny.

672
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:47,510
孩子们很安全  我保证
The kids are safe, I promise.

673
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:50,450
你一回来我就把他们交给你
I'll give them to you as soon as you get back.

674
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:55,020
要么跟我说实话  要么我把孩子交给照看中心
You're either telling me the truth or I've left my kids with a nut job.

675
01:03:57,030 --> 01:03:59,620
无论如何  你该回来接他们
Either way, you should come and get them.

676
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:21,810
那么  除了这只手表  你有其他炫的间谍用品吗
So, you got any other cool spy stuff, besides the watch?

677
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:31,850
别碰  很锋利
Don't touch. It's very sharp.

678
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:34,490
酷  还有什么
Cool. What else?

679
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,700
酷
Cool.

680
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:04,530
对不起  先生
Sorry, mister.

681
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:08,020
机场  快点
Airport. Step on it.

682
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:33,150
-鲍勃  你醒着的吗  -开玩笑  我怎么睡得找
- Bob? Are you awake? - Are you kidding?

683
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:38,790
-他是不是一直都这样打鼾啊  -在他房间旁你都听不到啊
- Does he always snore like that? - Can't you hear him next door?

684
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,560
我一直以为是猪干的
I always thought it was the pig.

685
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:47,670
你和吉莉安结束了  是吧
It's over with you and Gillian, isn't it?

686
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:51,670
是  法瑞恩  结束了
Yes, Farren, it's over.

687
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:57,010
-你赢了  -但为什么我没有赢了的感觉呢
- You win. - Then why don't I feel like I won?

688
01:05:57,780 --> 01:06:01,310
如果你真的很爱她  不该这么轻易放弃
If you really loved her, you wouldn't give up this easily.

689
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:07,380
正是因为我爱她  也爱你们  所以我必须走开
It's because I love her and the three of you that I have to walk away.

690
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:10,690
你们的安全才是重要的
It's more important that you're safe.

691
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,920
我以为我可以让我过去的生活过去  可我不能
I thought I could put my other life behind me, but I can't.

692
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:20,430
高兴点儿  没加入这个家庭你很幸运
Be glad. You're lucky you're not joining this family.

693
01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:27,910
你不知道生活在一个不该你存在的地方  是件多么痛苦的事情
You've no idea what it's like to live in a place where you totally don't belong.

694
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:31,110
别这么肯定嘛  我是一个孤儿
Don't be so sure. I was an orphan.

695
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:36,520
我在一个有很多孩子的家庭长大  从来没接触父母  但我有家
I was raised in a group home. I never knew my parents, but I had a family.

696
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:40,450
我有很多很多兄弟姐妹
I had dozens of brothers and sisters there.

697
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:44,950
我跟他们中的任何一个人都没有血缘关系  但我爱他们所有人
And I wasn't related to any of them, but I loved them all.

698
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:50,090
家不是说你跟谁有血缘
Family isn't whose blood you carry.

699
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:54,100
而是说你爱的人和爱你的人
It's who you love and who loves you.

700
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:05,450
-吉莉安  -妈妈
- Gillian! - Mom!

701
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:16,290
吉莉安  我真的很抱歉
Gillian, I'm really sorry about everything.

702
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:26,130
跟我说实话  你是不是真的是特工
Tell me the truth. Are you really a spy?

703
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:32,440
是的  我本来想在吃饭的时候跟你说的  但你打断我了
Yes, I am. I was going to tell you at dinner, but you stopped me.

704
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:37,170
我不管什么原因  你让我的孩子们危险了
I don't care. You put my children in danger.

705
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:39,610
走
Just go.

706
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:50,160
鲍勃  你什么时候回来看我呢
Bob, when are we going to see you again?

707
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:53,820
你不能来看他们
You're not.

708
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:08,700
别走  你走了谁给我唱中文歌呢
Please don't go away. Who's gonna sing me China songs?

709
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:22,290
-你们会安全  我保证  -离我的孩子远一点
- You'll be safe. I promise. - Stay away from my children.

710
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:15,680
亲爱的妈妈  我很抱歉  但我不能呆在这里
Dear Mom, I am very sorry, but I cannot stay here.

711
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:18,980
我注定要当一个特工  像鲍勃一样
My destiny is to be a spy, like Bob.

712
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:28,820
我要跟他在一起  给你最好的祝福  妈妈
I am going with him. Best wishes, your son, lan.

713
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,170
鲍勃的信号重新动起来了  我收到了
Ho's signal just popped back up. We got him.

714
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:17,910
开动
Let's roll.

715
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:45,700
鲍勃  鲍勃
Bob! Bob!

716
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:48,860
-伊恩  -你落下了手表
- Lan. - You left your watch.

717
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:51,530
你在这里干嘛  走啊
What are you doing here? Let's go.

718
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:55,140
什么意思  我们才刚刚到这里啊
What do you mean? We just got here.

719
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:10,460
鲍勃  真巧啊  把他们绑起来
Bob Ho. What a coincidence. Tie them up.

720
01:11:17,930 --> 01:11:20,660
-你在这里干什么  伊恩  -我在找你
- What are you doing here, lan? - I'm coming with you.

721
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:22,200
我也想当特工
I want to be a spy, too.

722
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:27,070
这就是那个坏家伙啊  穿得可真够没品
Is this the bad guy? I thought he'd be better dressed.

723
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:32,510
-你怎么找到我的  -我找到了一个你的追踪设备
- How did you find me? - I found one of your tracking devices

724
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:35,210
就在拥抱你的时候放到了你的口袋里
and put it in your pocket when I hugged you goodbye.

725
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:37,480
-印象深刻  -谢谢
- I'm impressed. - Thanks.

726
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:41,110
-现在可以切入正题了吗  -我要不要强调一下我退休了
- Can we go back to business? - Would it help to mention I'm retired?

727
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:43,490
退休的人不会下载秘密
Retired men don't download secrets.

728
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:46,360
-我从来就没有下载过什么破秘密  -说谎
- I never downloaded anything. - He's lying.

729
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:50,590
你到底是要相信谁  我还是这种背叛者
Who are you going to believe? Me or the traitor?

730
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:54,570
有人很顽皮啊
Someone has been a very naughty boy.

731
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:59,340
到处放满了照相机和麦克风
He's got cameras and microphones mounted all over the place.

732
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,600
不错嘛  把我们引到这里来
Good plan, filming us together.

733
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:06,380
-你怎么能背叛国家呢  -很简单
- How could you turn against your country? - It's simple.

734
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:08,950
因为我会成为亿万富翁
I'm gonna be a billionaire.

735
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:13,750
记得你下载的文件吧  那是一种生物细菌的方程式
That file that you didn't download? It's a formula for a Growth Bacteria Hybrid.

736
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:17,820
那家伙专门吃石油  你可以想象
This stuff literally eats oil. Can you imagine?

737
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:22,200
一夜之间世界上
Overnight, all the world's oil supplies go poof.

738
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:25,960
除了俄国都严重缺油  这是不是很无价呢
All except for Russia's. It'll be priceless, right, comrade?

739
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,600
你怎么能让卡尔特跟你一起  干这事儿的呢
How did you get Colt to go along with you?

740
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:31,440
卡尔特  那个乡巴佬才不是  这个计划中的一部分呢
Colt? That hillbilly's not part of this.

741
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:33,200
他根本不知道发生了什么
He doesn't know what goes on in the real world.

742
01:12:33,310 --> 01:12:35,280
还觉得格斗才是来真的呢
He still thinks wrestling is real.

743
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:38,110
让小孩走吧  他跟这场纷争没有关系
Let the boy go. He has nothing to do with this.

744
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:41,810
有人刚才闲聊已经透露了我们的全部计划
Mr. Chit-Chat just laid out our whole plan.

745
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:48,020
我们不可能放他走
We cannot let him go.

746
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:52,360
-他会走漏风声的  -相信我  没有人会相信他的
- He will tell. - Trust me, no one would believe him.

747
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,790
这倒是说到点子上了
He's right about that.

748
01:12:57,070 --> 01:13:00,760
嘿  老板  我在外面发现了一个鬼鬼祟祟的人
Hey, boss. Look at what I found sneaking around outside.

749
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:03,870
-法瑞恩  -大家好
- Farren? - Hi, everybody.

750
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:06,600
坐啊
Please, have a seat.

751
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,570
别啊
This can't be happening.

752
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:15,380
波尔达克  让孩子们走  我帮你找到GBH文件
Poldark, let the children go and I will find this GBH file for you.

753
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:18,810
GBH  斯德哥尔摩GBH
GBH? Like, Stockholm GBH?

754
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:22,650
-你怎么知道  -天呐  不可能
- How do you know that? - No freaking way.

755
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:25,730
你是说这一切只是因为  他下载了一个非法的音乐会
You're telling me all of this is because he downloaded a bootleg concert?

756
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:27,300
你干的
You did what?

757
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:30,230
你下载了
You downloaded it?

758
01:13:30,330 --> 01:13:33,270
哇  这个公司对秘密也忒他妈看重了吧
Wow, these companies take piracy way too seriously.

759
01:13:33,370 --> 01:13:36,500
你在我电脑上乱搞  这是隐私啊
You were messing with my computer? That's private.

760
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:38,470
我只是想装酷一下
I just wanted to seem cool.

761
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:41,270
你不用装  你本来就很酷
You don't need to. You are cool.

762
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:45,580
-你是我见过的最酷的孩子之一  -谢谢
- You're one of the coolest kids I know. - Really? Thanks.

763
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:49,210
嘿  你们忽视一个带着枪的男人
Hey, over here. Man with a gun.

764
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:52,820
等等  我是你认识的唯一的孩子啊
Wait a minute. I am one of the only kids you know.

765
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:57,490
-文件在哪里  -我的iPod里  我家的桌子上
- Where is the file? - It's on my iPod, on my desk at home.

766
01:13:58,530 --> 01:14:03,630
看见了吧  如果想要成为一个特工  就不能对坏蛋说实话
Now, see, you want to be a spy. Never tell the truth to the bad guy.

767
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:06,130
抱歉  我是菜鸟
Sorry, I'm new at this.

768
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:10,770
塔蒂安娜  带些人去他家  找到文件
Tatiana, take some men to the kid's house and find the iPod.

769
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,730
家里有人怎么办
What if the family is home?

770
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:18,140
上了这条船就要  杀了他们
Ever since you dyed your hair blonde... Kill them.

771
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:21,810
-不  别  -去  给我搞回iPod
- No, don't! - Go, bring me that iPod.

772
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:23,740
来  走  走
Come on, go. Go.

773
01:14:36,730 --> 01:14:38,930
现在  你嘛
Now, as for you...

774
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,360
棒极了
Awesome!

775
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:30,410
法瑞恩  走
Farren, let's go.

776
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:35,480
-我找无线位图  -那我打开无线广播
- I call dibs on the front. - Then I pick the radio station.

777
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:40,460

Okay. Ready?

778
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:44,030
好  等等

拜拜  鲍勃
Goodbye, Bob.

781
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:01,140
吉莉安  等等  别挂
Gillian, wait. Don't hang up.

782
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:07,710
等等  我们必须在他们之前赶到
Hang on. We've got to get there before they do.

783
01:16:13,130 --> 01:16:17,230
情报局里有你还可以相信的人吗  可以打电话的
Is there anyone at the agency you can still trust? Someone you can call?

784
01:16:17,330 --> 01:16:20,890
当然  但是他们拿走了我的摄像头  我没有证据
Sure, but they tore out my cameras. I have no proof of anything.

785
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:26,100
不一定啊  就在刚才  我用手机录下了谈话全过程
Except that, as it happens, I recorded that entire conversation on my cell phone.

786
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:29,570
好样儿的嘛  家伙
Way to go, dork.

787
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:36,920
卡尔特  只需要听着  我有样东西要放给你听
Colt... Just listen. I'm going to play you something.

788
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:42,990
记得你下载的文件吧  那是一种生物细菌的方程式
That file that you didn't download? It's a formula for a Growth Bacteria Hybrid.

789
01:16:43,090 --> 01:16:45,430
那家伙专吃石油
This stuff literally eats oil.

790
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:51,220
这是什么情况
What is this?

- Everybody inside. - Bob, we need to talk.

妈  这不是在开玩笑  他怎么说我们就怎么做
Mom, this isn't a joke. Do whatever he says.

796
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:19,960
-好  -来

800

801
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:46,350
我看到他们了  他们来了
I saw them outside. They're coming.

803
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:50,080
你试着跟上大家的思路吧
Let's try and keep up.

804
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,960
太晚了  每个人都到楼上去  明白吗
It's too late. Everybody upstairs. Understand me?

805
01:17:58,230 --> 01:17:59,570
呆在这里
Stay there.

806
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:04,800
我的设备呢
Where's my stuff?

807
01:18:05,310 --> 01:18:07,440
-嘿  带上一点这些东西  -这是什么

保护我们的设备
Protection.

809
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:13,620
你怎么玩儿打火机呢  我不让你玩儿火
Why do you have a lighter? I don't want you playing with fire.

810
01:18:21,690 --> 01:18:24,130
好吧  就这一次  走
Okay, maybe just this once. Let's go.

811
01:18:24,230 --> 01:18:25,520
不请吃就捣乱
Trick or treat.

812
01:18:55,090 --> 01:18:58,490
快点  关门  关门  好了
Hurry. Close it. Close it quick. Okay.

813
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,680

- I forgot Chuckle. - Nora! Nora!

814
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:22,240
你扮的是什么
What are you supposed to be?

815
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:26,520
电子人  从外星来  把你轰走
A cyborg, sent from the future to blast you away.

816
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:37,200
妈咪  那个人会飞
Mommy, that man can fly.

817
01:20:02,490 --> 01:20:06,160
真不敢相信你居然这么对我们  置孩子的安危于不顾
I can't believe you did this to my family, endangered my kids.

818
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,630
我不是有意的  我爱他们
I didn't mean to. I love your kids.

819
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:11,290
我想跟你结婚  想跟你们四个在一起
I want to marry you, all four of you.

820
01:20:11,870 --> 01:20:13,460
我也确实想过要跟你结婚
And I wanted to marry you.

821
01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:16,200
但是这个美梦已经飞了
But our wedding gifts would have to be opened by the bomb squad.

822
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:19,240
好了  鲍勃  别闹了
All right, Ho. Enough games.

823
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:31,220
我以为我终于找到一个正常的男人了  一个看起来
I finally found a normal guy, I thought, someone who likes to...

824
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:35,180
我们能待会儿讨论吗
Can we talk about this later?

825
01:20:55,810 --> 01:20:58,280
-他调了包  -拿下他

嘿  兄弟伙
Hey, guys.

829
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:35,180
我要走了
Gotta go.

830
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:37,920
我们要偷抢糖果  或许该从更小的小孩子身上下手
Maybe we should just stick to stealing candy from little kids.

831
01:21:38,020 --> 01:21:39,850
是啊  真正的小孩
Yeah, real little kids.

832
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:49,230
-这将会很有趣  -嘿  拉瑞  咚咚
- This is going to be fun. - Hey, Larry. Knock, knock.

834
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:12,950
来  进来  关上门  快点  关门
Come on, guys, get in the room and lock the door. Hurry. Lock it.

835
01:22:33,580 --> 01:22:36,370
如假包换的爱尔兰炖肉
Irish stew in the name of the law.

836
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:40,440
很抱歉你的退休时光这么快就结束了  鲍勃
Sorry your retirement was so short, Bob.

837
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:47,280
-你可以杀了我  但是请放了这一家人  -不可能  他们知道太多了
- You can kill me. Let the family go. - I can't. They've seen too much.

838
01:22:47,390 --> 01:22:49,360
但是我会让你先行一步  就不会看到了
But I'll let you go first so you don't have to watch.

839
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:50,860
嘿  先生
Hey, mister.

840
01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:00,230
别以为这样改变了什么
Don't think this changes anything.

841
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:03,370
-不要动  -没事

他们是好人
They're the good guys.

843
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:13,740
你这个肮脏的家伙啊  走
You stinking lowlife. Come on. Let's go.

844
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:19,820
妈妈
Mom!

845
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:28,190
嘿  把这些东西松掉
Hey, loosen these things up.

846
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:31,600
对不起  怎么了  手铐太紧了
I'm sorry. What's wrong? Got the handcuffs too tight?

847
01:23:31,730 --> 01:23:35,690
我可不知道怎么松  我不过是个乡巴佬而已
I don't know how these things work. I'm just a dumb hillbilly.

848
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,440
-都好吗  -浑身青一块紫一块
- Everybody okay? - Bumps and bruises.

850
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:47,510
嘿  你这是什么  孩子

兄弟伙儿  你录下对话  真不错啊
Nice work recording that conversation, partner.

852
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:55,820
你有一天能够成为一个优秀的间谍
This young man might make a heck of a spy someday.

853
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,200
你们要多快才会给我橙色的连衣裤
How quickly can you give me orange jumpsuit?

854
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:11,940
我怀疑过你  很抱歉
I'm sorry I suspected you.

855
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,910
别担心  老伙计

861
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:45,970
鲍勃
Bob.

862
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:50,740
我会想你的
I'm gonna miss you.

863
01:24:50,850 --> 01:24:52,640
我也一样
I'll miss you, too.

864
01:25:00,190 --> 01:25:01,520
等等
Wait.

865
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:05,880
我知道他撒谎了  但是他这么做也是为了保护我们
I know he lied, but he did it to protect us.

866
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,860
整个过程  他唯一想做的就是保护我们  妈妈
This whole time, all he ever wanted to do was protect us, Mom.

867
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:12,870
妈妈
And, Mom,

868
01:25:17,510 --> 01:25:21,340
你永远都不会找到  像鲍勃这么棒的人了  不会了
you're never gonna find a man as good as Bob, never again.

869
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:22,740
永远
Never.

870
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:26,640
我从来没想过我会说这些
I never thought I'd say this,

871
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:28,840
我同意法瑞恩说的
but I agree with Farren.

872
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,620
你也说点什么吧
I suppose you have something to say, too.

873
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:38,090
我想要鲍勃当我的爹地
I want Bob to be my daddy.

874
01:25:51,610 --> 01:25:55,670
吉莉安  你是否愿意  让鲍勃成为你的法定丈夫呢
Do you, Gillian, take Bob to be your lawfully wedded husband?

875
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:57,610
我愿意
I do.

876
01:25:57,710 --> 01:26:01,580
鲍勃  你是否愿意  让吉莉安成为你的法定妻子呢
And do you, Bob, take Gillian to be your lawfully wedded wife?

877
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:05,720
吉莉安
Gillian.

878
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:09,490
我还要告诉你一件事情
There's one more thing I have to tell you.

879
01:26:10,130 --> 01:26:12,860
我的真名不是鲍勃
My name really isn't Bob.

880
01:26:16,270 --> 01:26:17,820
没关系
That's okay.

881
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:20,430
我愿意
I do.

882
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,730
我宣布你们成为夫妻  你可以吻你的新娘了
I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.

883

884
01:26:58,270 --> 01:26:59,370
卡
And cut.

885
01:27:07,050 --> 01:27:10,580
是啊  那个家伙太狡猾了  他能够吃下钉子拉出
No, that man's so crooked, he could eat nails and...

886
01:27:10,690 --> 01:27:12,590
或许他只是想免费让他的邮箱装满油
Maybe he just wanted to fill up his gas tanks for free.

887
01:27:12,690 --> 01:27:13,680
我不能责怪他
I can't blame him.

888
01:27:13,790 --> 01:27:17,380
不是  那个家伙太狡猾了  他能够吃下钉子拉出
No, that man's so crooked, he could eat nails and...

889
01:27:21,130 --> 01:27:22,120
对不起
Sorry.

890
01:27:22,230 --> 01:27:23,930
对不起  先生
Sorry, mister.

891
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:36,910
好了
All right.

892
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:42,240
怎么了
What's going on?

893
01:27:42,350 --> 01:27:45,180
鲍勃  我不想扮公主了
Bob, I don't want to be a princess anymore.

894
01:27:45,290 --> 01:27:47,520
我想扮
I want to be a...

895
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:53,290
我是一个国际特工  被中国的中央情报
