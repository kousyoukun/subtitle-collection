1
00:00:41,818 --> 00:00:44,082
Some say juvenile.

2
00:00:44,154 --> 00:00:46,816
I say genius!

3
00:00:58,001 --> 00:00:59,901
Leave me alone!

4
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:03,731
Matt, I'm getting ready
for graduation!

5
00:01:05,809 --> 00:01:07,333
Matt!

6
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:15,677
Say goodbye
to your little toy.

7
00:01:15,752 --> 00:01:20,348
And say hello to Matt owning
his big sister for eternity!

8
00:01:22,092 --> 00:01:24,356
Never give up

9
00:01:24,428 --> 00:01:26,760
Yeah, yeah

10
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,594
Never give up

11
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:34,262
The tide is high,
but I'm holding on

12
00:01:34,338 --> 00:01:39,366
I'm gonna be
your number one

13
00:01:39,443 --> 00:01:41,308
I'm not the kind of girl

14
00:01:41,378 --> 00:01:45,337
Who gives up
just like that

15
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:48,213
Oh, no

16
00:01:48,285 --> 00:01:52,881
It's not the things you do
that tease and hurt me bad

17
00:01:52,956 --> 00:01:57,450
But it's the way you do
the things you do to me

18
00:01:57,527 --> 00:01:59,893
I'm not the kind of girl

19
00:01:59,963 --> 00:02:03,956
Who gives up
just like that

20
00:02:04,034 --> 00:02:06,696
Oh, no

21
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:11,639
The tide is high,
but I'm holding on

22
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:15,735
I'm gonna be
your number one

23
00:02:15,812 --> 00:02:20,306
The tide is high,
but I'm holding on

24
00:02:20,384 --> 00:02:23,876
I'm gonna be
your number one

25
00:02:23,954 --> 00:02:25,182
Ooh

26
00:02:25,255 --> 00:02:28,247
Number one

27
00:02:28,325 --> 00:02:29,986
Number one

28
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,223
Number one

29
00:02:33,296 --> 00:02:34,627
Number one

30
00:02:34,698 --> 00:02:38,634
Every girl wants you
to be her man

31
00:02:38,702 --> 00:02:43,969
But I'll wait right here
till it's my turn

32
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,804
I'm not the kind of girl

33
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:49,777
Who gives up
just like that

34
00:02:49,846 --> 00:02:52,576
Oh, no

35
00:02:52,649 --> 00:02:57,450
The tide is high,
but I'm holding on

36
00:02:57,521 --> 00:03:02,117
I'm gonna be
your number one

37
00:03:02,192 --> 00:03:06,856
The tide is high,
but I'm holding on

38
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,367
I'm gonna be
your number one

39
00:03:11,435 --> 00:03:14,563
Number one

40
00:03:14,638 --> 00:03:16,071
Number one

41
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:19,870
Number one

42
00:03:19,943 --> 00:03:20,932
Gotta hold on

43
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:23,172
Every time
that I get the feeling

44
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:25,544
You give me something
to believe in

45
00:03:25,615 --> 00:03:27,742
Every time
that I got you near me

46
00:03:27,818 --> 00:03:29,979
I know the way
that I want it to be

47
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:32,681
But you know
I'm gonna take my chance now

48
00:03:32,756 --> 00:03:34,781
I'm gonna make it happen
somehow

49
00:03:34,858 --> 00:03:36,883
And you know
I can take the pressure

50
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,428
A moment's pain
for a lifetime of pleasure

51
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:41,555
Pleasure, pleasure,
pleasure...

52
00:03:41,631 --> 00:03:46,034
Every girl wants you
to be her man

53
00:03:46,103 --> 00:03:50,733
But I'll wait right here
till it's my turn

54
00:03:50,807 --> 00:03:52,832
I'm not the kind of girl

55
00:03:52,943 --> 00:03:57,073
Who gives up
just like that

56
00:03:57,147 --> 00:03:59,638
Oh, no

57
00:03:59,716 --> 00:04:04,676
The tide is high,
but I'm holding on

58
00:04:04,754 --> 00:04:09,020
I'm gonna be
your number one

59
00:04:09,092 --> 00:04:10,957
The tide is high

60
00:04:11,027 --> 00:04:13,518
But I'm holding on

61
00:04:13,597 --> 00:04:17,260
I'm gonna be
your number one

62
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:18,266
Whoa!

63
00:04:18,335 --> 00:04:20,929
Every time
that I get the feeling

64
00:04:21,004 --> 00:04:23,165
You give me something
to believe in

65
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,504
Every time
that I got you near me

66
00:04:25,575 --> 00:04:27,805
I know the way
that I want it to be

67
00:04:27,878 --> 00:04:30,403
But you know
I'm gonna take my chance now

68
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,607
I'm gonna make it happen
somehow

69
00:04:32,682 --> 00:04:34,877
And you know
I can take the pressure

70
00:04:34,951 --> 00:04:37,351
A moment's pain
for a lifetime of pleasure

71
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,682
The tide is high...

72
00:04:38,755 --> 00:04:42,122
I shall win the Academy Award!

73
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,225
Yesterday, you were in diapers,

74
00:04:45,295 --> 00:04:47,729
and now you're graduating
junior high.

75
00:04:47,797 --> 00:04:50,925
You're growing up, and I can't
believe you're going to Rome

76
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:53,196
for two weeks
all by yourself.

77
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,070
Without me.
Without me there with you.

78
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,767
Without me with you there.

79
00:04:58,842 --> 00:05:00,104
You there without me.

80
00:05:00,177 --> 00:05:02,577
Mom, that's about
all the combinations

81
00:05:02,646 --> 00:05:04,273
of those words you can make.

82
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:07,407
Lizzie, this is a big day
for you, sweetheart.

83
00:05:07,484 --> 00:05:09,645
He's going to quote a dead guy.

84
00:05:11,121 --> 00:05:14,420
As William Shakespeare wrote,
"Be not afraid of greatness:

85
00:05:14,491 --> 00:05:17,051
some are born great,
some achieve greatness,

86
00:05:17,127 --> 00:05:19,561
and some have greatness
thrust upon them."

87
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:22,792
Thanks, Dad, but I'm just trying
to get through graduation.

88
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:25,426
Greatness can wait
till this nightmare's over.

89
00:05:25,502 --> 00:05:26,594
Hey, Gordo.

90
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,399
So, do I look okay?

91
00:05:28,471 --> 00:05:29,870
I'm your guy best friend.

92
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,170
You should talk to Miranda
about this.

93
00:05:32,242 --> 00:05:34,073
But she's in Mexico City.

94
00:05:34,144 --> 00:05:37,307
Yes. Your blue robe
looks way cooler

95
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,177
than all the other girls'.

96
00:05:39,249 --> 00:05:40,910
Oh...my...God.

97
00:05:40,984 --> 00:05:44,715
Only you would think
you could hide that powder- blue,

98
00:05:44,788 --> 00:05:46,346
puffy-sleeved,
it's-kind-of-a-peasant-dress-

99
00:05:46,423 --> 00:05:48,823
but-it-might-just-be-
a-baggy- disaster

100
00:05:48,892 --> 00:05:50,917
that you wore
to the spring dance.

101
00:05:52,195 --> 00:05:55,164
Lizzie McGuire, you are
an outfit repeater!

102
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,695
But I...

103
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:01,464
Maybe I'm an outfit repeater,

104
00:06:01,538 --> 00:06:03,301
but you're
an outfit rememberer,

105
00:06:03,373 --> 00:06:05,341
which is just as pathetic.

106
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:08,036
Does she not have
anything better to do

107
00:06:08,111 --> 00:06:09,908
than make my life miserable?

108
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,143
I mean...
we used to be best friends.

109
00:06:13,216 --> 00:06:15,548
But that was before
she became popular.

110
00:06:15,619 --> 00:06:17,382
McGuire!

111
00:06:17,454 --> 00:06:19,354
Go.

112
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:20,946
Hey, Mr. Escobar.

113
00:06:23,026 --> 00:06:24,857
Nice after-shave.

114
00:06:24,928 --> 00:06:26,156
Oh, thank you.

115
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:29,062
Margaret Chan either has ebola
or a very bad cold.

116
00:06:29,132 --> 00:06:30,565
In any event, you're up.

117
00:06:30,634 --> 00:06:32,067
U-U-Up where?

118
00:06:32,135 --> 00:06:33,693
At the podium.

119
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,830
You are going to deliver
the class president's speech.

120
00:06:36,906 --> 00:06:38,999
B-But what about
the vice president?

121
00:06:39,075 --> 00:06:40,269
He's not graduating.

122
00:06:40,343 --> 00:06:42,470
The secretary treasurer's
next in line.

123
00:06:42,545 --> 00:06:44,376
All I did was handle petty cash.

124
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:47,507
I'm sorry, but you're not
buying your way out of this.

125
00:06:47,584 --> 00:06:49,552
I want you to deliver
your speech

126
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:51,587
with as much pride
and commitment

127
00:06:51,655 --> 00:06:53,088
as Margaret Chan would,

128
00:06:53,156 --> 00:06:55,283
even though
you're no Margaret Chan.

129
00:07:01,831 --> 00:07:04,265
You're no Margaret Chan.

130
00:07:04,334 --> 00:07:06,700
You're no Margaret Chan.

131
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,135
You're no Margaret Chan.

132
00:07:08,204 --> 00:07:09,796
Run!

133
00:07:12,676 --> 00:07:15,611
Ladies and gentlemen,
uh, Lizzie McGuire.

134
00:07:26,122 --> 00:07:27,987
Um...

135
00:07:28,058 --> 00:07:30,788
U-Uh, Margaret Chan
couldn't make it tonight,

136
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,024
so I'm going - I'm going to
be filling in for her.

137
00:07:36,766 --> 00:07:39,098
Not that any of us
could really do that,

138
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:41,262
but, um, anyway...

139
00:07:41,338 --> 00:07:44,330
Honey, I'm losing the feeling
in my knuckles.

140
00:07:44,407 --> 00:07:47,433
I think that we can all agree
that junior high

141
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,172
is filled with
embarrassing and awkward

142
00:07:50,246 --> 00:07:54,740
and sometimes just downright
humiliating moments, right?

143
00:07:57,454 --> 00:07:59,046
Uh...

144
00:07:59,122 --> 00:08:01,556
Oh!
Me neither.

145
00:08:01,624 --> 00:08:03,819
It is so sad.

146
00:08:04,928 --> 00:08:05,952
Wow.

147
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:08,190
It's like watching one
of those animals

148
00:08:08,264 --> 00:08:10,255
get killed
on the Discovery Channel.

149
00:08:15,238 --> 00:08:17,138
I-I think Margaret Chan

150
00:08:17,207 --> 00:08:20,335
would want me to have
some water right now.

151
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:22,900
Uhh! Oh!

152
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,187
Play something!
Do something!

153
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:40,655
Yes! Ha ha ha!

154
00:08:40,763 --> 00:08:42,253
Come on! Mom! Dad!

155
00:08:42,331 --> 00:08:44,265
I've got to get out
of the country!

156
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,166
I know you're still upset,
but it wasn't that bad.

157
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:48,567
Oh, really, Mom?

158
00:08:48,637 --> 00:08:52,368
Was your junior-high graduation
on "Good Morning America"?

159
00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:55,103
What creep would send
Diane Sawyer a video

160
00:08:55,177 --> 00:08:56,838
to embarrass you like that?

161
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:57,936
Oh.

162
00:09:05,187 --> 00:09:06,916
- Ugh!

163
00:09:06,989 --> 00:09:09,685
What is that?

164
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,022
That is Miss Ungermeyer.

165
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,358
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey!

166
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,455
She's gonna be our principal
for the next four years.

167
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:19,091
If you stay on her good side,

168
00:09:19,168 --> 00:09:21,762
it's a one-way ticket
to an lvy League school.

169
00:09:21,837 --> 00:09:23,600
What if you're on her bad side?

170
00:09:23,672 --> 00:09:26,539
Excuse me!
I need to mop up some puke.

171
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:27,836
Well, you...

172
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,174
You wind up as that guy?

173
00:09:30,245 --> 00:09:33,544
No. You end up working
for that guy.

174
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,675
Can you make sure there are
no garlic or soy products

175
00:09:36,752 --> 00:09:38,413
in anything Brittany
puts near her mouth?

176
00:09:38,487 --> 00:09:40,648
Miss Ungermeyer,
Luke has tennis elbow.

177
00:09:40,722 --> 00:09:42,553
Could somebody
carry his luggage?

178
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,525
My son has asthma,
and he must have his puffer.

179
00:09:45,594 --> 00:09:47,562
Brittany, she's got allergies.

180
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,261
Attention, parents...

181
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,267
shut your pie holes.

182
00:09:53,335 --> 00:09:56,668
I'm on a mission here
to drag your progeny

183
00:09:56,738 --> 00:10:00,367
to 31 historically significant
Roman landmarks

184
00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:02,535
in two weeks.

185
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:06,240
Now, when these back-talking
miscreants return to you,

186
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:10,115
they will have dipped their
toes in a lake of culture,

187
00:10:10,185 --> 00:10:11,846
before assuming their destiny

188
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,013
folding shirts
at the outlet mall.

189
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:17,718
Many - actually, most -
of your classmates opted

190
00:10:17,793 --> 00:10:21,627
for the 36-hour bus ride
to the Water-slide Wonderland.

191
00:10:21,697 --> 00:10:22,959
Whoo!

192
00:10:23,031 --> 00:10:24,726
But you...

193
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,861
you, who are not
mouth- breathing trailer trash,

194
00:10:28,937 --> 00:10:32,429
you will get to experience
the delights

195
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,533
of la citta eterna!

196
00:10:35,611 --> 00:10:36,873
Hmm-hmm.

197
00:10:38,547 --> 00:10:40,310
Rome. The eternal city.

198
00:10:40,382 --> 00:10:42,441
Did no one read
the info packets?

199
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,917
Watch and learn.

200
00:10:48,323 --> 00:10:49,813
Um, Miss Ungermeyer,

201
00:10:49,892 --> 00:10:53,225
I just wanted to let you know
I'm really looking forward

202
00:10:53,295 --> 00:10:56,264
to this exciting
and academically enriching trip.

203
00:10:56,331 --> 00:10:57,298
What's your name?

204
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:58,355
David Gordon.

205
00:10:58,433 --> 00:10:59,991
- David Gordon.
- Mm-hmm.

206
00:11:00,068 --> 00:11:01,660
I think, in ltalian,

207
00:11:01,737 --> 00:11:05,298
that means a sneaky brownnoser
with a hidden agenda, huh?

208
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:06,807
Uh, uh.

209
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,934
Yeah! Come on,
check those bags!

210
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:11,172
I want to see that junk
in the trunk

211
00:11:11,246 --> 00:11:12,611
and a seat looking neat.

212
00:11:16,018 --> 00:11:18,009
Okay.

213
00:11:21,857 --> 00:11:23,017
Mom...

214
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:27,226
Okay, it's only
two weeks, Mom.

215
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,162
- Honey, she's got to go.
- Two weeks.

216
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:35,836
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye.

217
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,804
- Safe trip, huh?
- Okay.

218
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:12,968
Sweetheart...

219
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,935
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

220
00:12:23,418 --> 00:12:25,010
Flight 72 to Rome.

221
00:12:25,087 --> 00:12:27,112
Final boarding,
Flight 72 to Rome.

222
00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:31,023
Hey! We're going to the land
where they invented spaghetti!

223
00:12:31,093 --> 00:12:32,822
Ah heh.

224
00:12:32,894 --> 00:12:34,486
Yeah, and the best part is

225
00:12:34,563 --> 00:12:37,157
Kate and all the little
teeth- whitening friends

226
00:12:37,232 --> 00:12:39,826
who'd be ragging on me
for messing up graduation

227
00:12:39,901 --> 00:12:41,493
went to Water-slide Wonderland.

228
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,596
How many Lizzies does it take
to screw in a light bulb?

229
00:12:44,673 --> 00:12:48,109
I don't know, but it only takes
one to screw up a graduation.

230
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,126
Hey. Zip it.

231
00:13:14,603 --> 00:13:15,797
Whoa!

232
00:13:15,871 --> 00:13:16,929
Whoa!

233
00:14:02,984 --> 00:14:07,148
Down each avenue or via,
street or strata

234
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:13,024
You can see 'em disappearing
two by two

235
00:14:13,095 --> 00:14:16,895
On an evening in Roma

236
00:14:16,965 --> 00:14:19,195
Do they take 'em
for espresso?

237
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:20,928
Yeah, I guess so

238
00:14:21,002 --> 00:14:26,599
On each lover's arm,
a girl I wish I knew

239
00:14:26,675 --> 00:14:30,543
On an evening in Roma

240
00:14:30,612 --> 00:14:34,548
So please meet me
in the plaza near your casa

241
00:14:34,616 --> 00:14:40,213
I am only one,
and that is one too few

242
00:14:40,288 --> 00:14:43,951
On an evening in Roma

243
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:47,517
Don't know what
the country's coming to

244
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:50,622
But in Rome,
do as the Romans do

245
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:53,395
Will you?

246
00:14:53,468 --> 00:14:56,835
- On an evening in Roma

247
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:02,967
Here we are.
Step right up.

248
00:15:03,044 --> 00:15:05,137
Number one...
Number two...

249
00:15:05,213 --> 00:15:06,560
Welcome to the Hotel Cambini.

250
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:07,908
Welcome to the Hotel Cambini.

251
00:15:07,983 --> 00:15:11,043
Lest you think there are many
of you and less of me

252
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:14,555
and it will therefore be easy
to pull anything over on me,

253
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:15,647
think again.

254
00:15:15,724 --> 00:15:17,658
In addition to being
smarter, faster,

255
00:15:17,726 --> 00:15:19,591
and better-looking
than most of you,

256
00:15:19,661 --> 00:15:21,458
I've also enlisted
a little help.

257
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:24,931
The assistant manager
of the hotel, Giorgio Averni,

258
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,059
was a commander
in the ltalian Navy

259
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:30,571
and is therefore
as up on his game as I am mine.

260
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,130
Giorgio, would you like
to brief my students

261
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,574
on the security procedures
of the hotel?

262
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:39,102
We serve at 5:00.

263
00:15:39,181 --> 00:15:40,876
The cookies.

264
00:15:42,517 --> 00:15:44,280
Yeah.

265
00:15:44,353 --> 00:15:46,617
You heard the man.

266
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:48,121
Room assignments.

267
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,714
David Gordon...

268
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,282
you will be rooming
with Ethan Craft.

269
00:15:52,361 --> 00:15:54,124
You'll be in Room 103.

270
00:15:54,196 --> 00:15:56,289
Are those English
or ltalian numbers?

271
00:15:56,365 --> 00:15:57,957
You got a problem with that?

272
00:15:58,033 --> 00:15:59,432
Um, no, ma'am.

273
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,765
Any room is just -
just fine for me.

274
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:03,429
Being a spineless jellyfish

275
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:06,770
is almost as unattractive
as being a little brownnoser.

276
00:16:08,877 --> 00:16:10,105
McGuire!

277
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:14,478
Seeing as how Margaret Chan
was unable to make the trip,

278
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:16,779
you will be rooming with...

279
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:19,753
Okay, I am not,
under any circumstances,

280
00:16:19,821 --> 00:16:21,379
sharing a room with -

281
00:16:21,456 --> 00:16:23,549
I'll be taking the bed
by the window.

282
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:24,956
You don't mind, do you?

283
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:28,393
Uh, ye-e-e-e-s!

284
00:16:29,464 --> 00:16:30,624
No.

285
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:33,429
I sleep much better
with the Swiss eiderdown.

286
00:16:33,502 --> 00:16:35,561
Lizzie, seeing as we're roomies

287
00:16:35,637 --> 00:16:38,003
and we're gonna be spending
time together,

288
00:16:38,073 --> 00:16:40,166
I wanted to let you know
I understand

289
00:16:40,242 --> 00:16:43,302
you want to put all that
embarrassing stuff behind you

290
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:45,846
and just move on
and have a fresh start.

291
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,444
You do?

292
00:16:48,517 --> 00:16:50,280
Yes. I understand
your dream.

293
00:16:50,352 --> 00:16:51,512
It's a big dream.

294
00:16:51,586 --> 00:16:54,419
It's a huge dream,
and you can't do it alone.

295
00:16:54,489 --> 00:16:57,117
In fact, I don't think
you can do it at all.

296
00:16:57,192 --> 00:16:58,250
Let it go.

297
00:17:00,262 --> 00:17:01,627
Lizzie, come on.

298
00:17:07,002 --> 00:17:07,934
Whoa!

299
00:17:08,003 --> 00:17:08,992
Gordo, what?

300
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,731
Don't worry.
Don't worry.

301
00:17:10,806 --> 00:17:11,966
Where are we going?

302
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,564
Look.

303
00:17:14,876 --> 00:17:16,400
Wow!

304
00:17:16,478 --> 00:17:18,912
Pretty cool, huh?

305
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,117
You know what, Gordo?

306
00:17:25,187 --> 00:17:27,883
I'm not gonna let
Kate Sanders get to me.

307
00:17:27,956 --> 00:17:29,184
Promise me something.

308
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,246
Anything.

309
00:17:30,325 --> 00:17:33,260
Promise that when we're here,
we'll find adventures.

310
00:17:33,328 --> 00:17:35,990
All right? This is
our chance to start over.

311
00:17:36,064 --> 00:17:38,589
I mean, do anything
that we want to do.

312
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:40,862
Yeah. I-I know.
You're right.

313
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:43,666
Hmm. You and me.
Adventures. Deal.

314
00:17:45,407 --> 00:17:46,704
Deal.

315
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,405
The Trevi Fountain was designed

316
00:17:54,483 --> 00:17:58,010
by Gian Lorenza Bernini
and Peitro da Cortona

317
00:17:58,086 --> 00:17:59,553
in the 17th century.

318
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:02,715
And it took about 100 years
to finish this bad boy.

319
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:06,227
Throughout history, people have
come from all over the world

320
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:09,559
to make a wish and toss their
coin in the Trevi Fountain.

321
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,258
Those people are suckers.

322
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,824
You got to make your own luck
in this world.

323
00:18:13,902 --> 00:18:17,497
All right, moving on, people.
Let's go.

324
00:18:17,572 --> 00:18:18,539
Scusi,

325
00:18:18,607 --> 00:18:20,199
Grazie.

326
00:18:20,275 --> 00:18:22,800
Scusi, Grazie,

327
00:18:22,878 --> 00:18:24,869
You know what?
Forget what she says.

328
00:18:24,946 --> 00:18:26,140
Make a wish.

329
00:18:26,214 --> 00:18:28,444
I'm in Rome
with my best friend.

330
00:18:28,517 --> 00:18:30,212
I'm good.
You make one.

331
00:18:30,285 --> 00:18:31,946
Okay.

332
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,351
Hmm.

333
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:34,786
Okay.

334
00:18:47,302 --> 00:18:48,894
lsabella?

335
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,437
Huh?

336
00:18:51,773 --> 00:18:55,334
Okay, I was wishing for smooth
sailing through high school,

337
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,435
but this will work.

338
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:59,412
Uh, I'm sorry.

339
00:18:59,481 --> 00:19:03,781
It's just you look an awful lot
like a friend of mine.

340
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:06,878
Paolo, you have to get
to your photo shoot.

341
00:19:06,955 --> 00:19:08,081
We got to go.

342
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:13,256
What you little halflings
are feeling right about now

343
00:19:13,328 --> 00:19:14,920
is your energy flagging.

344
00:19:14,996 --> 00:19:16,691
We got four more stops today.

345
00:19:16,765 --> 00:19:19,256
I want you to
at least be able to shuffle

346
00:19:19,334 --> 00:19:20,858
from monument to monument.

347
00:19:20,936 --> 00:19:23,370
We got one word for that,
and it's gelato.

348
00:19:23,438 --> 00:19:25,599
Keep in mind
that ltalian ice cream has

349
00:19:25,674 --> 00:19:28,234
about twice the sugar
of American ice cream.

350
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,904
Means you're gonna want about
two scoops, huh?

351
00:19:30,979 --> 00:19:32,913
I know I do.
All right.

352
00:19:32,981 --> 00:19:34,505
I don't mean to bother you.

353
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,915
I'm Paolo.
Paolo Valisari.

354
00:19:36,985 --> 00:19:39,351
Oh, um, I'm Lizzie McGuire,

355
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:41,116
and this is my friend Gordo.

356
00:19:41,189 --> 00:19:42,679
This is my friend Sergei.

357
00:19:42,757 --> 00:19:45,419
Sergei, doesn't she look
exactly like lsabella?

358
00:19:45,493 --> 00:19:46,960
- lsabella!
- Paolo!

359
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,491
Um...

360
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:53,534
Paolo!

361
00:19:53,602 --> 00:19:55,433
lsabella! Isabella!

362
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,432
Paolo! Paolo!

363
00:20:03,178 --> 00:20:04,839
Ciao, Paolo!

364
00:20:07,182 --> 00:20:08,672
Uh, hmm...

365
00:20:10,385 --> 00:20:12,649
Wow! That really
does look like me.

366
00:20:12,721 --> 00:20:15,747
Except for the hair,
you could be her twin.

367
00:20:15,824 --> 00:20:19,021
Isabella is my singing partner,
and you're like her sister.

368
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:20,789
Like two pods in a pea.

369
00:20:22,564 --> 00:20:25,465
Lizzie, can I see you again?

370
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:26,966
Maybe tomorrow?

371
00:20:27,035 --> 00:20:28,400
Please?

372
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,404
What's the word for "yes"
in ltalian?

373
00:20:30,472 --> 00:20:31,564
- Si,

374
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,971
Uh...

375
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,030
No, I'm -

376
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:35,804
It's okay.
I can cover for you.

377
00:20:35,877 --> 00:20:37,344
Head check!

378
00:20:37,412 --> 00:20:40,074
I'm sorry. I'm here
with my school, so I can't.

379
00:20:40,148 --> 00:20:41,706
Forgive me
if I embarrassed you.

380
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,774
Some people,
when they come to Rome,

381
00:20:43,852 --> 00:20:46,082
they want to find adventure.

382
00:20:46,154 --> 00:20:48,019
Oh, it's okay.

383
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:50,319
I got some cool cheese.

384
00:20:50,392 --> 00:20:52,451
Did you just say
"cool cheese"?

385
00:20:52,527 --> 00:20:53,494
Wah!

386
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:55,392
Paolo...

387
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:56,521
We must go.

388
00:20:56,598 --> 00:21:00,159
Uh, Lizzie,
if you change your mind,

389
00:21:00,235 --> 00:21:03,466
I will meet you tomorrow morning
at the Trevi Fountain at 9:00.

390
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:04,732
Hey, Gordon, McGuire,

391
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,899
did you not hear me say
"head check"?

392
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:09,170
15, 16.

393
00:21:09,244 --> 00:21:10,336
Who are you?

394
00:21:10,412 --> 00:21:11,572
Paolo Valisari.

395
00:21:14,249 --> 00:21:16,376
Put your money
in your front pockets.

396
00:21:17,786 --> 00:21:20,084
She makes me very scared.

397
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:22,282
Join the club.

398
00:21:22,357 --> 00:21:23,847
Lizzie...

399
00:21:26,261 --> 00:21:28,058
Ci vediamo,

400
00:21:28,129 --> 00:21:30,097
What does that mean?

401
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:32,633
We will see each other.

402
00:21:37,939 --> 00:21:39,270
Hey.

403
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,740
This Paolo and lsabella CD
isn't so bad.

404
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,540
I mean, if you're into
the Alanis Morissette-y,

405
00:21:44,612 --> 00:21:46,773
alternative, dark,
like, brooding,

406
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:47,872
I-never-go-out-

407
00:21:47,949 --> 00:21:50,918
and-my-life's-a-black-hole-
of-depression kind of thing,

408
00:21:50,985 --> 00:21:52,213
you'd think they stink.

409
00:21:52,287 --> 00:21:55,051
For driving-around-in-the-car-
with- the-top- down,

410
00:21:55,123 --> 00:21:57,387
Ioving-life kind of thing,
they're good.

411
00:21:57,459 --> 00:21:58,687
Here. Listen.

412
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,126
You don't have to sail
the ocean

413
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:02,527
Yeah, not bad.

414
00:22:02,597 --> 00:22:04,690
You use scented soap, huh?

415
00:22:04,766 --> 00:22:05,858
What?

416
00:22:05,934 --> 00:22:08,767
Um, it -
N-Never - never mind.

417
00:22:08,837 --> 00:22:13,035
So, Paolo wants me to meet him
at the Trevi Fountain tomorrow.

418
00:22:13,108 --> 00:22:14,132
So go.

419
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:17,235
That would mean I would have to
sneak away from the group.

420
00:22:17,312 --> 00:22:18,301
So?

421
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:20,040
I'm incapable of sneaking.

422
00:22:20,115 --> 00:22:21,980
Weren't you the one that said

423
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:25,076
we were gonna have adventures
on this trip?

424
00:22:25,153 --> 00:22:27,417
Yeah. We. We were
going to have adventures.

425
00:22:27,489 --> 00:22:28,751
And we will.

426
00:22:28,823 --> 00:22:32,190
It just so happens that
you have dibs on the first one.

427
00:22:33,928 --> 00:22:34,895
Okay.

428
00:22:34,963 --> 00:22:37,022
Just as long
as we don't do anything

429
00:22:37,098 --> 00:22:40,067
that would get us tossed
on a plane home.

430
00:22:40,135 --> 00:22:42,467
Uh. Unh.

431
00:22:42,537 --> 00:22:44,971
Lizzie, are -
are you feeling okay?

432
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:00,283
Is this girl sick,
or isn't she?

433
00:23:00,355 --> 00:23:03,449
She doesn't have a fever,
and yet she's in bed.

434
00:23:04,826 --> 00:23:06,987
Ask yourself why
a beautiful young girl

435
00:23:07,062 --> 00:23:09,053
on her first visit
to Rome,

436
00:23:09,131 --> 00:23:10,723
probably seeking adventure,

437
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,290
wants to lie in bed
all day.

438
00:23:14,636 --> 00:23:15,796
She's ill.

439
00:23:15,871 --> 00:23:19,136
I heard she fell down
at graduation,

440
00:23:19,207 --> 00:23:22,108
made a complete fool
out of herself.

441
00:23:22,177 --> 00:23:23,872
I saw that on CNN.

442
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:25,412
CNN?

443
00:23:27,482 --> 00:23:29,473
Often, the nervous system
collapses

444
00:23:29,551 --> 00:23:31,314
after that type of humiliation.

445
00:23:31,386 --> 00:23:32,375
Hmm.

446
00:23:33,889 --> 00:23:35,789
Do you have
any recommendations?

447
00:23:35,857 --> 00:23:37,654
Oh, yeah, yeah.

448
00:23:37,726 --> 00:23:41,492
This young woman
should stay in bed.

449
00:23:41,563 --> 00:23:46,591
Uh, she - she should
also eat two apricots.

450
00:23:46,668 --> 00:23:48,602
Oh, for digestion or...

451
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,900
No, they're in season.
Very delicious.

452
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:52,769
Feel better, Signorina McGuire.

453
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:54,035
You rest up, McGuire.

454
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:57,169
Don't want you to miss
all the adventures of Rome.

455
00:23:57,245 --> 00:23:59,338
Uh, doctor, I have a boil...

456
00:24:26,975 --> 00:24:28,067
Sorry.

457
00:24:32,747 --> 00:24:34,806
Uno, due, tre,

458
00:24:34,883 --> 00:24:36,043
- Tre,
- Tre,

459
00:24:39,421 --> 00:24:40,820
Bene,

460
00:24:46,995 --> 00:24:50,829
I-I just - I had them all wish
for you to come.

461
00:24:54,903 --> 00:24:56,894
Hmm...

462
00:24:56,972 --> 00:25:00,339
I don't have much time.
You know my chaperon -

463
00:25:00,408 --> 00:25:01,739
Wait, wait, wait.

464
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,971
I have to show you something.

465
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:05,307
Sometimes the world

466
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,371
Is a valley
of heartaches and tears

467
00:25:07,449 --> 00:25:08,882
- Come on.

468
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:12,681
And in the hustle and bustle,
no sunshine appears

469
00:25:12,754 --> 00:25:16,053
But you and I have a love
always there to remind us...

470
00:25:16,124 --> 00:25:17,056
Wow!

471
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:19,286
You should see Rome
the way Romans do.

472
00:25:19,361 --> 00:25:21,329
So you knew
that I would come.

473
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:22,920
I hoped you would.

474
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:27,262
Are you sure you know
how to drive this thing?

475
00:25:27,335 --> 00:25:29,826
This is Rome.
Nobody knows how to drive.

476
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:32,134
Volare

477
00:25:32,207 --> 00:25:34,266
Oh, oh

478
00:25:34,342 --> 00:25:36,105
Cantare

479
00:25:36,177 --> 00:25:38,771
Oh, oh, oh, oh

480
00:25:38,847 --> 00:25:43,375
Let's fly
way up to the clouds

481
00:25:43,451 --> 00:25:46,887
Away from
the maddening crowds

482
00:25:46,955 --> 00:25:49,856
We can sing in the glow
of a star that I know of

483
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:51,858
Where lovers enjoy
peace of mind

484
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:55,362
Let us leave the confusion
and all disillusion behind

485
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,295
Just like birds
of a feather

486
00:25:57,365 --> 00:26:00,061
And the rainbow together
we'll find

487
00:26:00,135 --> 00:26:01,830
Volare

488
00:26:01,903 --> 00:26:03,666
Oh, oh

489
00:26:03,738 --> 00:26:05,501
Cantare

490
00:26:05,573 --> 00:26:08,303
Oh, oh, oh, oh

491
00:26:15,016 --> 00:26:17,576
Whoo!

492
00:26:35,837 --> 00:26:37,771
Volare

493
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:39,238
Oh, oh

494
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:40,239
Oh, oh

495
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:42,003
Cantare

496
00:26:42,077 --> 00:26:45,046
Oh, oh, oh, oh

497
00:26:45,113 --> 00:26:49,049
No wonder
my happy heart sings

498
00:26:49,117 --> 00:26:52,883
Your love has given me
wings

499
00:26:52,954 --> 00:26:57,288
No wonder
my happy heart sings

500
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:02,058
Your love has given me
wings

501
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,961
Wow!

502
00:27:05,767 --> 00:27:08,998
I don't know what catastrophe
is going to happen in Rome,

503
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,197
but with Lizzie there,
something will.

504
00:27:11,272 --> 00:27:14,036
What are you going to do
with that information?

505
00:27:14,109 --> 00:27:17,101
Give it away, like you did
with the graduation video?

506
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:19,703
Hey! She was really
freaked out by that.

507
00:27:19,781 --> 00:27:21,749
And you have what
to show for it?

508
00:27:21,816 --> 00:27:24,376
The pride of a job well done?

509
00:27:24,452 --> 00:27:27,353
Try buying a PS2 with
the pride of a job well done.

510
00:27:27,422 --> 00:27:28,389
Oh!

511
00:27:28,456 --> 00:27:30,321
Matt, Matt, Matt.

512
00:27:30,392 --> 00:27:33,088
We've been over this
before. Cash up front.

513
00:27:33,161 --> 00:27:36,130
Melina,
are you staying for dinner?

514
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:38,222
- I'd love to, Mrs. McGuire.
- Great.

515
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:41,496
We'll need extra energy to work
on our summer reading list.

516
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:43,594
In that case,
I'll make brownies.

517
00:27:43,671 --> 00:27:44,467
Oh.

518
00:27:45,507 --> 00:27:47,907
I've said it before.
You're weak. Weak!

519
00:27:47,976 --> 00:27:50,638
Don't do anything
without consulting me first.

520
00:27:53,681 --> 00:27:56,275
You rock.

521
00:28:10,098 --> 00:28:13,534
Hey, Paolo,
can I ask you something?

522
00:28:13,601 --> 00:28:14,761
Si, carina,

523
00:28:14,836 --> 00:28:17,930
Um, I know that our lives
are a little different.

524
00:28:18,006 --> 00:28:20,770
Actually, like, several
universes different.

525
00:28:20,842 --> 00:28:24,608
But doesn't Sergei get tired
of following us around?

526
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:26,704
Actually, Sergei's my bodyguard.

527
00:28:26,781 --> 00:28:28,942
So, you see,
between me and Sergei,

528
00:28:29,017 --> 00:28:30,712
you'll always be safe.

529
00:28:33,354 --> 00:28:34,821
Whoa!

530
00:28:34,889 --> 00:28:38,757
How famous do you have to be
before you need a bodyguard?

531
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:43,497
Paolo, go! Go!

532
00:28:43,565 --> 00:28:45,726
I-It's Miss Ungermeyer!
It's our bus!

533
00:28:49,737 --> 00:28:50,795
- Go!
- I cannot.

534
00:28:52,207 --> 00:28:55,608
Miss Ungermeyer, didn't we just
pass the Castel Sant'Angelo?

535
00:28:55,677 --> 00:28:56,769
Yep. What about it?

536
00:28:56,845 --> 00:28:59,211
I just noticed
it's not on our itinerary.

537
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,508
That is correct.

538
00:29:00,582 --> 00:29:02,209
Well, s-shouldn't it be?

539
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:04,478
I-I mean,
it was a papal residence

540
00:29:04,552 --> 00:29:06,110
and it does contain frescoes

541
00:29:06,187 --> 00:29:08,951
from artists influenced
by the school of Raphael.

542
00:29:09,023 --> 00:29:10,786
What are you up to, Gordon?

543
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:11,883
N-N-Nothing.

544
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,325
I-I just figure that,

545
00:29:13,394 --> 00:29:15,419
while in Rome,
we should be exposed

546
00:29:15,497 --> 00:29:17,761
to as much Renaissance,
Raphaelite work

547
00:29:17,832 --> 00:29:20,824
typified by chiaroscuro
and Hellenic mythical imagery

548
00:29:20,902 --> 00:29:22,369
as humanly possible.

549
00:29:24,506 --> 00:29:26,906
Whew.

550
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:29,773
Ah, Gordon,
you are on the list,

551
00:29:29,844 --> 00:29:32,278
and the list is not a place
you want to be.

552
00:29:32,347 --> 00:29:34,508
What is this?
Only in Rome, huh?

553
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:39,386
You know how to move that, or
you want me to do it for you?

554
00:29:41,623 --> 00:29:43,113
What are you looking at?

555
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,354
Want a piece of that,
a piece of the Ungermeyer?

556
00:29:55,103 --> 00:29:57,333
Over there by that statue.
You see it?

557
00:29:57,406 --> 00:29:58,338
Yeah.

558
00:29:58,407 --> 00:29:59,704
That's where
the artist Caravaggio

559
00:29:59,775 --> 00:30:01,970
had his opponent
burned at the stake.

560
00:30:02,044 --> 00:30:03,068
Or was it the pope

561
00:30:03,145 --> 00:30:05,477
who had Caravaggio burned
at the stake?

562
00:30:05,547 --> 00:30:07,777
Either way,
this neighborhood was tough.

563
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,687
Paolo...

564
00:30:12,754 --> 00:30:14,016
Si, carina?

565
00:30:15,557 --> 00:30:17,650
Do you still love her?

566
00:30:17,726 --> 00:30:19,216
Who? Isabella?

567
00:30:19,294 --> 00:30:20,352
Si,

568
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:24,597
Of course I still love her.

569
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:26,998
But like a sister.

570
00:30:27,069 --> 00:30:28,832
So, why did you break up?

571
00:30:28,904 --> 00:30:31,600
It's, um, it's complicated.

572
00:30:33,642 --> 00:30:35,269
- What?

573
00:30:35,343 --> 00:30:38,608
Yes, we've been voted "best
pop duo of the year" again.

574
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,671
But I want to do
more serious music.

575
00:30:40,749 --> 00:30:42,580
And when I told this
to lsabella,

576
00:30:42,651 --> 00:30:44,016
she said flat-out "no."

577
00:30:44,086 --> 00:30:46,247
I was forced to tell her,
"This is it.

578
00:30:46,321 --> 00:30:48,289
This will be
our last CD together."

579
00:30:48,356 --> 00:30:49,846
Did she totally freak out?

580
00:30:49,925 --> 00:30:51,358
She totally freak out.

581
00:30:51,426 --> 00:30:53,860
I feel awful about that,
but what about me?

582
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:55,521
I need to grow as an artist.

583
00:30:55,597 --> 00:30:56,529
Yeah.

584
00:30:56,598 --> 00:30:58,759
So, the other day
when I saw you,

585
00:30:58,834 --> 00:31:01,496
I just - I don't know,
I had this crazy -

586
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:02,969
I just - I don't know.

587
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:04,335
W-What?

588
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:07,307
I had this crazy idea
that maybe you could help me.

589
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:13,842
Come on. How crazy could it be?
Just tell me.

590
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:16,042
No, I can't.
It's too - It's too...

591
00:31:16,118 --> 00:31:17,642
- Please.
- Okay.

592
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:20,916
Isabella and I are supposed to
present an award together

593
00:31:20,989 --> 00:31:23,219
at the International
Music Video Awards.

594
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:24,588
Cool!

595
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:27,355
I-I mean, cool for
regular people like me,

596
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:29,454
but for you,
I guess it's like work.

597
00:31:29,531 --> 00:31:31,396
No, no, no.
It's cool for me, too.

598
00:31:31,466 --> 00:31:33,434
You get all kinds
of free stuff.

599
00:31:33,502 --> 00:31:35,766
But now because lsabella's
so mad at me,

600
00:31:35,837 --> 00:31:37,236
she's refusing to appear.

601
00:31:37,305 --> 00:31:40,672
The record company's threatening
to sue if she doesn't show up.

602
00:31:40,742 --> 00:31:41,674
What about you?

603
00:31:41,743 --> 00:31:43,973
For me is no problem.
I write the music.

604
00:31:44,045 --> 00:31:45,979
I don't know
where it comes from.

605
00:31:46,047 --> 00:31:47,639
It just comes from me.

606
00:31:47,716 --> 00:31:48,808
La la la la

607
00:31:48,884 --> 00:31:51,079
See?
So I can go solo.

608
00:31:51,153 --> 00:31:52,518
But lsabella...

609
00:31:55,223 --> 00:31:57,589
She needs the help to sing.

610
00:31:57,659 --> 00:31:59,320
You mean lsabella lip-synchs?

611
00:31:59,394 --> 00:32:00,326
Please, please!

612
00:32:00,395 --> 00:32:02,863
Promise me you
will speak of this to no one.

613
00:32:02,931 --> 00:32:05,559
Imagine what would happen
to lsabella's career.

614
00:32:05,634 --> 00:32:08,660
Oh, that's so sweet.
You still care about her.

615
00:32:10,572 --> 00:32:12,597
You're definitely
broken up, right?

616
00:32:12,674 --> 00:32:13,606
Si,

617
00:32:13,675 --> 00:32:15,575
So, when I saw you yesterday

618
00:32:15,644 --> 00:32:17,942
and how people thought
you were lsabella,

619
00:32:18,013 --> 00:32:19,071
I got my crazy idea

620
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:21,638
that maybe you could pretend
to be lsabella

621
00:32:21,716 --> 00:32:23,946
and present the award
with me onstage.

622
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:26,419
Present an award?
O-Onstage?

623
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:31,789
In front of an audience?

624
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,886
I-I-I'm really not good
in front of crowds.

625
00:32:34,963 --> 00:32:36,521
I could never do that.

626
00:32:36,598 --> 00:32:38,566
Of course you can do it.

627
00:32:38,633 --> 00:32:40,294
You are magnifico.

628
00:32:41,703 --> 00:32:45,366
I don't know ltalian,
but I know what that means.

629
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,705
I don't know, Paolo.
I...

630
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:53,179
Don't worry, carina,

631
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,876
I could never ask you to do
this crazy thing.

632
00:33:00,889 --> 00:33:04,222
No. You know what?
You don't have to ask.

633
00:33:04,292 --> 00:33:07,090
If this is gonna help
you and lsabella, then...

634
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,990
...I'll do it.

635
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:12,427
Grazie!

636
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,297
Prego!

637
00:33:35,123 --> 00:33:37,057
Head check!

638
00:33:44,165 --> 00:33:46,463
Gordo. Gordo.

639
00:33:49,471 --> 00:33:52,702
You, Lizzie McGuire,
are actually presenting an award

640
00:33:52,774 --> 00:33:54,264
at the lMVAs with Paolo?

641
00:33:54,342 --> 00:33:55,969
No. Me lsabella with Paolo.

642
00:33:56,044 --> 00:33:57,671
- What?
- It's a long story.

643
00:33:57,746 --> 00:33:59,737
I'm doing it because
lsabella won't.

644
00:33:59,814 --> 00:34:03,147
You're gonna get up onstage
in front of all these people?

645
00:34:03,218 --> 00:34:06,016
That's the great thing.
It's not gonna be me.

646
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:07,987
It's Paolo's idea
to help lsabella

647
00:34:08,056 --> 00:34:10,149
because he still loves her.

648
00:34:10,225 --> 00:34:13,160
But not romantically.
Like a sister.

649
00:34:13,228 --> 00:34:14,855
He is so amazing.

650
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:15,918
And he's 17!

651
00:34:15,997 --> 00:34:17,259
For being so famous

652
00:34:17,332 --> 00:34:20,233
and used to getting everything
that you want,

653
00:34:20,302 --> 00:34:22,964
he's just -
he's just so kind.

654
00:34:23,038 --> 00:34:24,403
For real?

655
00:34:24,472 --> 00:34:26,531
That's a lot
to say about someone

656
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:28,007
just knowing them a day.

657
00:34:28,076 --> 00:34:29,202
I-I know that.

658
00:34:29,277 --> 00:34:32,144
But I feel like
I've known him my whole life.

659
00:34:32,213 --> 00:34:33,646
Anyway, um...

660
00:34:33,715 --> 00:34:36,411
I just wanted to come by
and thank you.

661
00:34:36,484 --> 00:34:38,509
I had the most magical day
of my life.

662
00:34:38,586 --> 00:34:41,214
It wouldn't have happened
if it weren't for you.

663
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,552
It was that good, huh?

664
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:45,490
You're such a good friend.

665
00:34:48,263 --> 00:34:49,992
The sting.

666
00:34:51,366 --> 00:34:52,663
What sting?

667
00:34:52,734 --> 00:34:54,929
You want a little mano a mano?

668
00:34:56,638 --> 00:34:58,663
See, this is
one of the reasons

669
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,435
me and you aren't friends.

670
00:35:00,508 --> 00:35:03,443
I never have any idea
what you're talking about.

671
00:35:03,511 --> 00:35:05,411
Some dudes get the approach.

672
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,606
Others, the sting.

673
00:35:06,681 --> 00:35:09,411
That ltalian dude.
He's big-time approach.

674
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:12,817
I actually feel my brain
turning into goo.

675
00:35:12,887 --> 00:35:14,320
Embrace the sting.

676
00:35:14,389 --> 00:35:16,584
That's what you're vibin'
from Lizzie.

677
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:18,057
Wait a minute.

678
00:35:18,126 --> 00:35:21,459
Now, you actually think
that I'm jealous of Paolo?

679
00:35:21,529 --> 00:35:23,429
Word.

680
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:24,988
Oh, no.

681
00:35:25,066 --> 00:35:26,897
No, see, that would mean

682
00:35:26,968 --> 00:35:29,368
that I like Lizzie
as more than a friend.

683
00:35:29,437 --> 00:35:31,701
You and I
have trouble communicating?

684
00:35:31,773 --> 00:35:33,331
You're wrong, man.

685
00:35:35,276 --> 00:35:37,107
Whoa!

686
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:40,341
This girl looks freakishly
like my sister!

687
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:42,714
- Ow.
- Zoom! Zoom!

688
00:35:45,286 --> 00:35:47,254
Another freakish coincidence.

689
00:35:47,322 --> 00:35:50,485
I mean, she has the same
necklace as my sister's.

690
00:35:50,558 --> 00:35:51,752
Huh.

691
00:35:51,826 --> 00:35:55,159
Why do we even pretend
you're in charge?

692
00:35:56,898 --> 00:35:59,389
- Let's see what this says.

693
00:35:59,467 --> 00:36:00,525
Ow.

694
00:36:00,602 --> 00:36:01,933
"lsabella goes blond.

695
00:36:02,003 --> 00:36:04,267
Italian pop duo
Paolo and lsabella

696
00:36:04,339 --> 00:36:07,365
wowed the crowd outside a shop
near the Trevi Fountain,

697
00:36:07,442 --> 00:36:09,637
showing off lsabella's
new blond hair."

698
00:36:09,711 --> 00:36:13,511
They must think that Lizzie
is this famous singer!

699
00:36:13,581 --> 00:36:18,143
And if I show this to my mom,
Lizzie will be so busted!

700
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:21,620
If you show this to your mom,
it's worth nothing.

701
00:36:21,689 --> 00:36:26,626
But if you show this
to the ltalian tabloids,

702
00:36:26,694 --> 00:36:29,629
we will be rolling in cash,
my friend.

703
00:36:29,697 --> 00:36:31,824
Interesting!

704
00:36:35,336 --> 00:36:36,803
"We"?

705
00:36:36,871 --> 00:36:38,253
Not up to toughing it out
on the streets with us?

706
00:36:38,254 --> 00:36:39,635
Not up to toughing it out
on the streets with us?

707
00:36:41,209 --> 00:36:42,870
I could try, Miss Ungermeyer.

708
00:36:42,945 --> 00:36:45,175
No, I just hate seeing you
being denied

709
00:36:45,247 --> 00:36:48,307
the cultural experience
of being in a foreign country.

710
00:36:48,383 --> 00:36:49,748
You missed seven points

711
00:36:49,818 --> 00:36:51,911
of historical significance
yesterday.

712
00:36:51,987 --> 00:36:55,445
I know. It's really killing me
too, Miss Ungermeyer.

713
00:36:55,524 --> 00:36:58,618
Which is why I thought
I'd bring you something

714
00:36:58,694 --> 00:37:00,491
to help ease the pain, hmm?

715
00:37:00,562 --> 00:37:03,622
Mmh, well, that's really
thoughtful of you.

716
00:37:03,699 --> 00:37:06,224
Seeing as how
your teeny- tiny little body

717
00:37:06,301 --> 00:37:07,768
doesn't have the strength,

718
00:37:07,836 --> 00:37:11,203
we're gonna have to let
your mind do the wandering.

719
00:37:11,273 --> 00:37:12,672
Ah!

720
00:37:12,741 --> 00:37:15,437
"The Rise and Decline
of the Roman Empire," hmm?

721
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:18,502
I'd like one report on the rise
and one on the decline.

722
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,569
Ouch!

723
00:37:19,648 --> 00:37:22,879
If I didn't have a headache
a minute ago, I do now.

724
00:37:24,453 --> 00:37:26,887
You don't have a problem
with that, do you?

725
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:28,752
Um, no.

726
00:37:28,824 --> 00:37:31,884
- What else do I have to do?

727
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,019
Why not

728
00:37:34,096 --> 00:37:35,859
Take a crazy chance?

729
00:37:35,931 --> 00:37:38,126
Why not

730
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,259
Do a crazy dance?

731
00:37:40,335 --> 00:37:42,235
If you lose the moment

732
00:37:42,304 --> 00:37:44,033
You might lose a lot

733
00:37:44,106 --> 00:37:46,597
So why not?

734
00:37:46,675 --> 00:37:48,643
Why not?

735
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:51,406
Why not
take a crazy chance?

736
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:54,907
Wow.

737
00:37:59,488 --> 00:38:01,251
I am so grateful for your help.

738
00:38:01,323 --> 00:38:03,791
You're doing a very kind thing
for lsabella.

739
00:38:03,859 --> 00:38:06,054
Uh, Paolo, where are we?

740
00:38:06,128 --> 00:38:08,426
Via Condotti.
One of the most expensive

741
00:38:08,497 --> 00:38:10,362
shopping districts
in the world.

742
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,764
We must find you
the perfect outfit.

743
00:38:15,203 --> 00:38:16,135
Ah!

744
00:38:16,204 --> 00:38:18,001
Oh, hey, lsabella, Paolo!

745
00:38:18,073 --> 00:38:19,563
Ciao!

746
00:38:19,641 --> 00:38:22,201
Your hair is so blond
and, uh, innocent.

747
00:38:22,277 --> 00:38:23,904
- Who did it?
- Um...

748
00:38:23,979 --> 00:38:26,743
The island we were on
was really, really sunny,

749
00:38:26,815 --> 00:38:28,544
so it was j-just the sun.

750
00:38:28,617 --> 00:38:30,016
We must get sun, too, no?

751
00:38:30,085 --> 00:38:31,382
Ciao, bella!

752
00:38:31,453 --> 00:38:32,681
Ciao, Ciao, Ciao.

753
00:38:32,754 --> 00:38:34,278
They are so tall!

754
00:38:34,356 --> 00:38:37,325
- They all want to be you.
- They want to be lsabella.

755
00:38:37,392 --> 00:38:40,225
Sit and I'll get Franca.
I will just be a moment.

756
00:38:42,397 --> 00:38:43,796
Whoa! Take your time.

757
00:38:43,865 --> 00:38:46,959
I'll just be sitting here
in heaven.

758
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:48,434
Hard as it is to imagine,

759
00:38:48,503 --> 00:38:50,698
as we look at the ruins
of the Forum,

760
00:38:50,772 --> 00:38:53,138
that this was once
the center of commerce,

761
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:56,075
religion, and politics
in ancient Rome.

762
00:38:56,144 --> 00:38:58,476
All right, now,
the Forum came into being

763
00:38:58,547 --> 00:39:00,742
in the sixth century B.C.,

764
00:39:00,816 --> 00:39:05,150
and with it,
a new urban culture was born.

765
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,619
Uh, um, di-

766
00:39:06,688 --> 00:39:08,280
Yeah, Craft?

767
00:39:08,356 --> 00:39:10,085
Is it time for the spaghetti?

768
00:39:10,158 --> 00:39:11,819
It's 9:00 in the morning.

769
00:39:11,893 --> 00:39:14,760
So? You never had leftover
spaghetti for breakfast?

770
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,024
I don't eat carbs.

771
00:39:16,098 --> 00:39:18,498
You never had
a spaghetti sandwich, either?

772
00:39:18,567 --> 00:39:22,435
This cultural experience
is, like, so wasted on you.

773
00:39:22,504 --> 00:39:25,302
Excuse me, where did you
buy that Prada bag?

774
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:28,441
Craft! Sanders! Separate.

775
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,774
We did, Miss Ungermeyer.
And thank God.

776
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:35,341
Why don't you people, uh,
do something at your, uh,

777
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:36,577
skill level here?

778
00:39:36,651 --> 00:39:40,519
Take a 10-minute shopping break
while I choke down an espresso.

779
00:39:42,057 --> 00:39:45,151
This dude definitely spent
too much time on his biceps

780
00:39:45,227 --> 00:39:48,526
and not enough on his abs.
Totally old school.

781
00:39:53,235 --> 00:39:54,793
Wha-

782
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,303
Nice spy, bro.

783
00:39:56,371 --> 00:39:57,895
Yeah, watch and learn.

784
00:39:57,973 --> 00:40:00,771
The slow curve.
Works every time.

785
00:40:00,842 --> 00:40:02,309
I've got to talk to them.

786
00:40:02,377 --> 00:40:05,437
That's not how the slow curve
works. They come to us.

787
00:40:09,317 --> 00:40:11,376
Um, eh, ciao.

788
00:40:11,453 --> 00:40:13,011
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

789
00:40:13,088 --> 00:40:15,420
Do you guys speak English?

790
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:16,752
Yes.

791
00:40:16,825 --> 00:40:18,884
It is your friend we like.

792
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,518
Word.

793
00:40:20,595 --> 00:40:22,222
Word?
Is that his name?

794
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:23,264
Yeah, sure.

795
00:40:23,331 --> 00:40:25,561
Do you know who that is
on the cover?

796
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:28,194
- Oh, lsabella. Certo,
- Certo,

797
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:31,000
Do you think you guys could
translate it for me?

798
00:40:31,072 --> 00:40:34,667
Um, only if
you introduce us to Word.

799
00:40:35,677 --> 00:40:37,542
Can I keep the magazine, then?

800
00:40:37,612 --> 00:40:39,239
Deal!

801
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:41,839
All right.
Let's go.

802
00:40:48,957 --> 00:40:50,549
Ciao, Word.

803
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,686
Word?

804
00:40:53,929 --> 00:40:54,861
Mmh?

805
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:55,988
English?

806
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,588
She's speaking English.

807
00:40:57,666 --> 00:41:00,931
Our single is in English
and lsabella needs to practice.

808
00:41:03,538 --> 00:41:06,701
What have you done?

809
00:41:06,775 --> 00:41:08,106
Uh, uh, uh...

810
00:41:08,176 --> 00:41:11,703
You look...
You look like a schoolgirl.

811
00:41:13,782 --> 00:41:15,773
Maximus, what is wrong?

812
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:16,942
You love lsabella.

813
00:41:17,018 --> 00:41:19,282
Nice Maximus.

814
00:41:22,991 --> 00:41:25,084
Very odd.

815
00:41:26,127 --> 00:41:28,721
There is something...

816
00:41:28,797 --> 00:41:31,925
something very different
about you.

817
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,160
Um...

818
00:41:33,235 --> 00:41:34,429
Rest.

819
00:41:34,502 --> 00:41:36,800
The rest on the island
did lsabella good.

820
00:41:36,871 --> 00:41:37,929
She is transformed.

821
00:41:38,006 --> 00:41:39,132
Yeah.

822
00:41:39,207 --> 00:41:41,607
Well, I cannot
put clothes on this.

823
00:41:41,676 --> 00:41:42,836
You - fix the hair.

824
00:41:42,911 --> 00:41:44,071
Fix the eyebrows.

825
00:41:44,145 --> 00:41:45,077
Fix the lips.

826
00:41:46,147 --> 00:41:47,637
- Oh!
- And fix the ears!

827
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:49,240
Fix the ears?

828
00:41:49,317 --> 00:41:51,911
Jewelry.

829
00:41:51,987 --> 00:41:53,147
Jewelry.

830
00:41:53,221 --> 00:41:55,587
That's a language
every girl understands.

831
00:41:58,393 --> 00:41:59,951
You better work

832
00:42:00,028 --> 00:42:00,960
Covergirl

833
00:42:01,029 --> 00:42:01,996
Work it, girl

834
00:42:02,063 --> 00:42:03,189
Give it a twirl

835
00:42:03,265 --> 00:42:04,823
Do your thing

836
00:42:04,899 --> 00:42:06,628
On the runway

837
00:42:06,701 --> 00:42:08,328
Work

838
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:10,496
You better work it, girl

839
00:42:10,572 --> 00:42:12,233
Wet your lips

840
00:42:12,307 --> 00:42:14,366
And smile to the camera

841
00:42:14,442 --> 00:42:16,205
Work

842
00:42:16,278 --> 00:42:17,643
- Ah! Aah!
- Work

843
00:42:17,712 --> 00:42:19,646
- Turn to the right
- Oh!

844
00:42:19,714 --> 00:42:20,703
Sashay

845
00:42:20,782 --> 00:42:22,374
Chante

846
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:26,409
Well, it don't matter
what you wear

847
00:42:26,488 --> 00:42:28,888
They're checkin' out
your savoir faire

848
00:42:28,957 --> 00:42:30,481
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah

849
00:42:30,558 --> 00:42:34,016
And when you walked
into the room

850
00:42:34,095 --> 00:42:38,156
You had everybody's eyes
on you

851
00:42:38,233 --> 00:42:39,564
Supermodel

852
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:48,566
Work

853
00:42:48,643 --> 00:42:50,577
Work it, girl

854
00:42:50,645 --> 00:42:52,510
Do your thing

855
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,343
On the runway

856
00:42:54,416 --> 00:42:57,317
Work,
you've got to work it, girl

857
00:42:57,385 --> 00:42:58,477
Of the world

858
00:42:58,553 --> 00:42:59,884
Wet your lips

859
00:42:59,954 --> 00:43:01,888
And smile to the camera

860
00:43:01,956 --> 00:43:03,890
Work

861
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:05,653
Work

862
00:43:05,727 --> 00:43:06,716
- Aah!
- Work

863
00:43:06,795 --> 00:43:08,353
Sashay

864
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:09,658
Chante

865
00:43:09,731 --> 00:43:11,460
Work

866
00:43:11,533 --> 00:43:13,330
Work

867
00:43:13,401 --> 00:43:14,595
Work

868
00:43:14,669 --> 00:43:15,601
Sashay

869
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:16,602
Chante

870
00:43:16,671 --> 00:43:18,935
You better work

871
00:43:19,007 --> 00:43:20,998
Work

872
00:43:21,076 --> 00:43:22,043
Work

873
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:23,338
Give it up

874
00:43:23,411 --> 00:43:26,608
On the ru-u-u-nway

875
00:43:26,681 --> 00:43:28,342
Work

876
00:43:28,416 --> 00:43:30,748
Work

877
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:34,016
Ohhhh

878
00:43:34,089 --> 00:43:35,215
Whoo

879
00:43:38,026 --> 00:43:40,551
Okay. Diva - good.

880
00:43:40,628 --> 00:43:41,959
Tacky - bad.

881
00:43:43,765 --> 00:43:46,063
We'll have to fix that.

882
00:43:56,277 --> 00:43:58,006
Okay, none of these are me.

883
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,570
- Why are you laughing at me?

884
00:44:00,648 --> 00:44:02,411
You're not supposed to be you.

885
00:44:02,484 --> 00:44:05,112
If I have to go onstage
as lsabella,

886
00:44:05,186 --> 00:44:07,950
then I-I'm gonna have to
be confident,

887
00:44:08,022 --> 00:44:09,922
and that's the thing
I'm worst at.

888
00:44:09,991 --> 00:44:12,551
- We are all the same that way.
- Not you.

889
00:44:12,627 --> 00:44:14,151
Yes, me, and lsabella, too.

890
00:44:14,229 --> 00:44:16,288
It's how she works
through her fears

891
00:44:16,364 --> 00:44:17,524
that makes her strong.

892
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,999
Isabella doesn't let
Franca di Montecatini

893
00:44:20,068 --> 00:44:21,433
tell her what to wear.

894
00:44:21,503 --> 00:44:23,494
Isabella tells Franca.

895
00:44:23,571 --> 00:44:25,300
Okay, so you're telling me

896
00:44:25,373 --> 00:44:27,568
to tell Franca
di Monteca-teca- tecatini

897
00:44:27,642 --> 00:44:28,870
how I should dress?

898
00:44:28,943 --> 00:44:29,932
Si,

899
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:33,010
Test your strength.

900
00:44:33,081 --> 00:44:34,946
Vai! Vai, vai,

901
00:44:36,117 --> 00:44:37,641
You don't like my clothes?

902
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:40,187
No. No.
I-I love your clothes.

903
00:44:40,255 --> 00:44:42,120
But I don't want you
to dress me.

904
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:44,385
What?!

905
00:44:44,459 --> 00:44:46,518
See, I'm not your Barbie doll.

906
00:44:46,594 --> 00:44:48,357
I am lsabella Parigi,

907
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:50,455
and I dress myself.

908
00:44:50,532 --> 00:44:51,931
So, choices.

909
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,433
I-I need choices.

910
00:44:55,503 --> 00:44:57,130
Whoa.

911
00:44:59,507 --> 00:45:01,839
I really like these two.
You pick.

912
00:45:06,314 --> 00:45:07,303
Both.

913
00:45:07,382 --> 00:45:09,213
Both.

914
00:45:09,284 --> 00:45:10,444
Wow.

915
00:45:10,518 --> 00:45:13,385
This is the exact color
I wore to my spring formal.

916
00:45:13,455 --> 00:45:15,923
- Danny Kessler thought...

917
00:45:17,425 --> 00:45:20,883
Look at all of you.
You'd think that I'm American.

918
00:45:20,962 --> 00:45:23,658
I am,
how you say, um...

919
00:45:23,731 --> 00:45:24,663
awesome?

920
00:45:27,969 --> 00:45:30,563
The island.
You should go more often.

921
00:45:30,638 --> 00:45:32,071
Mmh.

922
00:45:33,174 --> 00:45:34,573
Ooh, ooh, ooh

923
00:45:34,642 --> 00:45:37,236
Goodbye, Lizzie McGuire.
Hello, fabulous.

924
00:45:38,913 --> 00:45:40,642
Yeah, yeah, yeah

925
00:45:40,715 --> 00:45:42,012
Come on

926
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:44,711
You make me feel
like a star

927
00:45:44,786 --> 00:45:45,844
Oh, baby

928
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,388
You say, "Stay, baby, stay

929
00:45:48,456 --> 00:45:50,014
Just the way you are"

930
00:45:50,091 --> 00:45:53,083
And tell me, "Girl, you're
fine and you will shine

931
00:45:53,161 --> 00:45:54,822
Forever in my heart"

932
00:45:54,896 --> 00:45:57,592
That's why you,
yeah, you

933
00:45:57,665 --> 00:46:01,101
You make me feel
like a star

934
00:46:01,169 --> 00:46:03,262
Ooh, ooh, ooh

935
00:46:03,338 --> 00:46:04,532
- There you go.
- Grazie.

936
00:46:04,606 --> 00:46:05,538
Grazie.

937
00:46:05,607 --> 00:46:07,234
Ooh, ooh, ooh

938
00:46:08,276 --> 00:46:09,743
I'm ready for my close-up.

939
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:10,937
- Whoo!

940
00:46:13,348 --> 00:46:16,044
I cannot believe
that not one Roman guy

941
00:46:16,117 --> 00:46:17,641
has asked me out yet.

942
00:46:21,322 --> 00:46:22,414
Look.

943
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:24,720
Paolo...

944
00:46:24,792 --> 00:46:25,918
We gotta go!

945
00:46:28,227 --> 00:46:30,787
Where's the zoom
on this thing?

946
00:46:30,863 --> 00:46:33,354
Uh, uh...

947
00:46:37,636 --> 00:46:39,297
Hello? Excuse me.

948
00:46:40,372 --> 00:46:41,771
Oh!

949
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:43,900
I'm sorry.
I was just...

950
00:46:45,244 --> 00:46:47,144
Hup! Head check!

951
00:46:47,213 --> 00:46:49,977
Let's go! On the bus,
then back to the hotel!

952
00:46:50,049 --> 00:46:52,176
Come on! Come on! Go!

953
00:46:52,251 --> 00:46:54,014
Andiamo! Andiamo!

954
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,335
- Hold on!

955
00:47:10,402 --> 00:47:12,029
Okay! Hello.

956
00:47:12,104 --> 00:47:15,267
Hotel Cambini.
This is Giorgio.

957
00:47:16,408 --> 00:47:18,035
- Go!
- Huh? What?

958
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:19,873
Wait.

959
00:47:19,945 --> 00:47:21,742
Excuse me,
can you fix this?

960
00:47:21,814 --> 00:47:23,281
It will not close.

961
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:26,375
Why is it open
when there is no rain?

962
00:47:26,452 --> 00:47:28,010
This umbrella is stubborn.

963
00:47:28,087 --> 00:47:30,555
It's bad luck to have
an open umbrella inside.

964
00:47:30,623 --> 00:47:33,148
- In Hotel Cambini, no bad luck.
- Hey, thanks.

965
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:34,783
GlORGlO:
Ah!

966
00:47:38,264 --> 00:47:40,425
One at a time.
No running.

967
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:44,862
Ha ha ha!

968
00:47:44,937 --> 00:47:48,429
Ha! Ha ha!
Age before beauty, huh?

969
00:47:49,808 --> 00:47:52,868
You look strangely large
and familiar.

970
00:47:52,945 --> 00:47:54,139
Which floor?

971
00:47:54,213 --> 00:47:56,340
Oh. Thank you. First.

972
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,473
Okay.

973
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:01,581
Little hint for you -

974
00:48:01,654 --> 00:48:04,680
you want to push the button,
elevator moves.

975
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:06,850
Elevator is not safe.

976
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:08,291
You an employee here?

977
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,850
- No.
- No.

978
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:12,796
Who are you to tell me
whether the elevator's safe?

979
00:48:12,865 --> 00:48:13,991
I am Sergei.

980
00:48:14,066 --> 00:48:15,761
Sergei.

981
00:48:15,834 --> 00:48:18,667
You're gonna have to
stand down immediately.

982
00:48:22,174 --> 00:48:24,665
Just because you are one hunk
of Slavic muscle

983
00:48:24,743 --> 00:48:27,712
does not mean you're not
gonna make it on my list!

984
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,839
Elevator is safe now.

985
00:48:38,357 --> 00:48:40,291
Hey! Your umbrella!

986
00:48:47,934 --> 00:48:49,902
Feeling any better?

987
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:51,095
Mom?

988
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,566
Still a little warm.

989
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,666
Miss Sanders,
would you be so kind

990
00:48:57,743 --> 00:48:59,335
as to look after her for me?

991
00:48:59,412 --> 00:49:02,438
As in do stuff for her?
Why should I be punished?

992
00:49:02,515 --> 00:49:04,142
I'm not the one who's sick.

993
00:49:04,217 --> 00:49:06,583
Next year, I'm joining
the mouth breathers

994
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,176
at Water-slide Wonderland.

995
00:49:08,254 --> 00:49:09,983
You are so busted.

996
00:49:10,056 --> 00:49:12,149
You've been out
of this hotel room.

997
00:49:12,225 --> 00:49:13,351
What?

998
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,520
How do you know?

999
00:49:15,595 --> 00:49:16,789
Please.

1000
00:49:16,863 --> 00:49:20,162
Your eyebrows finally match,
your hair has highlights,

1001
00:49:20,233 --> 00:49:21,860
fresh manicure.

1002
00:49:21,934 --> 00:49:25,267
I smelled acetone the second
I walked in the lobby.

1003
00:49:25,338 --> 00:49:28,739
Okay, but you didn't rat me out
to Miss Ungermeyer.

1004
00:49:28,808 --> 00:49:29,832
Yet.

1005
00:49:29,909 --> 00:49:32,377
Not until I figure out
what's in it for me.

1006
00:49:32,445 --> 00:49:34,072
Now spill, Dorkerella.

1007
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:39,716
You'll never make me talk!

1008
00:49:39,785 --> 00:49:41,514
I-I know that this
sounds insane,

1009
00:49:41,587 --> 00:49:44,715
but I think Paolo
really does like me.

1010
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:47,452
How could this happen?
How did you get my trip?

1011
00:49:47,527 --> 00:49:49,825
How is Lizzie McGuire
living this fantasy

1012
00:49:49,896 --> 00:49:51,887
and I can't even get
an ltalian boy

1013
00:49:51,964 --> 00:49:53,795
to buy me a plate of spaghetti?

1014
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:56,164
Um, Kate,
you don't eat spaghetti.

1015
00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:00,071
I'd eat carbs if an ltalian boy
bought them for me.

1016
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:05,839
So, I suppose you want me
to keep quiet about this?

1017
00:50:06,846 --> 00:50:08,746
Yeah.
I'd appreciate that.

1018
00:50:08,814 --> 00:50:10,179
Well, I'll keep it quiet

1019
00:50:10,249 --> 00:50:12,979
if you keep it quiet
about me keeping it quiet.

1020
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:16,419
And when we get back home,
I'm the cool one again,

1021
00:50:16,489 --> 00:50:18,389
and you turn
back into a pumpkin.

1022
00:50:19,825 --> 00:50:21,349
Oh, my God. It's her.

1023
00:50:21,427 --> 00:50:22,655
What are you doing?

1024
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,855
Uh, it's a long story.

1025
00:50:25,765 --> 00:50:27,460
What do you want?
We're closed.

1026
00:50:27,533 --> 00:50:30,696
I-I just wanted
to talk to Lizzie.

1027
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:31,759
So talk.

1028
00:50:31,837 --> 00:50:34,431
I was kind of thinking
maybe, you know,

1029
00:50:34,507 --> 00:50:36,134
outside in the courtyard.

1030
00:50:36,209 --> 00:50:38,473
If this is about
that parallel-universe,

1031
00:50:38,544 --> 00:50:41,377
Italian-rock-star,
Lizzie's- suddenly-a- diva thing,

1032
00:50:41,447 --> 00:50:43,074
I know all about it.

1033
00:50:43,149 --> 00:50:44,480
She figured it out.

1034
00:50:46,185 --> 00:50:47,948
Evil and smart.

1035
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,612
Embrace it. Fear it.

1036
00:50:49,689 --> 00:50:51,850
You might want
to take a look at this.

1037
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:54,654
I'm on the front cover
of a tabloid!

1038
00:50:54,727 --> 00:50:56,752
I wish to thank everyone

1039
00:50:56,829 --> 00:51:00,128
who's always believed in me
for this great honor.

1040
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:01,826
Do you know what that says?

1041
00:51:01,901 --> 00:51:04,665
Paolo and lsabella
are supposed to be singing

1042
00:51:04,737 --> 00:51:05,999
at the music awards.

1043
00:51:06,072 --> 00:51:08,165
Well, it's got to be a mistake.

1044
00:51:08,241 --> 00:51:10,505
I had some ltalian girls
translate it.

1045
00:51:10,576 --> 00:51:11,941
Paolo didn't tell you?

1046
00:51:12,011 --> 00:51:12,943
Mmh, no.

1047
00:51:13,012 --> 00:51:15,776
Don't you think it's weird
he tried to hide this?

1048
00:51:15,848 --> 00:51:16,974
Can you believe it?

1049
00:51:17,049 --> 00:51:18,812
Maybe it's a last-minute thing.

1050
00:51:18,884 --> 00:51:21,751
Aren't these things planned
months in advance?

1051
00:51:21,821 --> 00:51:25,222
When did you become an expert
on ltalian award-show thingies?

1052
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:27,987
It's called common sense,
which I have a lot of

1053
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:30,688
to make up for my lack
of the slow curve.

1054
00:51:30,763 --> 00:51:32,025
Slow curve?

1055
00:51:32,098 --> 00:51:33,258
Forget it.

1056
00:51:33,332 --> 00:51:35,300
If you want to believe
some ltalian kid

1057
00:51:35,368 --> 00:51:37,199
you think you know
after two days

1058
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:39,170
because he's
an international superstar,

1059
00:51:39,238 --> 00:51:42,036
is really rich and has
nice hair, be my guest.

1060
00:51:42,108 --> 00:51:43,166
Gordo.

1061
00:51:52,118 --> 00:51:53,551
Oh, my God! He's early!

1062
00:52:00,192 --> 00:52:01,284
Lizzie.

1063
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,328
Oh, my God,
I gotta get dressed.

1064
00:52:03,396 --> 00:52:06,695
I'll cover for you in case
Miss Ungermeyer does one of her

1065
00:52:06,766 --> 00:52:08,927
middle-of-the-night,
head-check things.

1066
00:52:09,001 --> 00:52:10,263
Thanks. I owe you.

1067
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:11,360
Duh!

1068
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:19,870
Mom, Dad, I found something
on the Internet

1069
00:52:19,945 --> 00:52:21,776
I think you both should see.

1070
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,075
What is it?

1071
00:52:23,149 --> 00:52:24,878
Since Lizzie's in Europe,

1072
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:27,475
I thought I'd do
a little E- search on ltaly.

1073
00:52:27,553 --> 00:52:28,577
That's nice, son.

1074
00:52:28,654 --> 00:52:31,851
But what I found out,
it's not so E-assuring.

1075
00:52:33,092 --> 00:52:36,550
In fact, it may shock you.

1076
00:52:37,396 --> 00:52:38,727
What are we looking at?

1077
00:52:38,798 --> 00:52:41,995
Maybe nothing, and, uh,
maybe something.

1078
00:52:42,068 --> 00:52:44,593
You see, when polled,

1079
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:47,764
74% of ltalian teenage boys

1080
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:51,708
said they would most like
to date American girls.

1081
00:52:51,777 --> 00:52:53,506
Where'd you get these numbers?

1082
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:56,412
They're available for anyone
who has a computer.

1083
00:52:56,482 --> 00:52:58,848
You don't have to worry
about your sister.

1084
00:52:58,918 --> 00:53:01,546
She's well-chaperoned.
Miss Ungermeyer's there.

1085
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:05,454
Yeah, what is she,
5'1", 5'2" max?

1086
00:53:08,494 --> 00:53:10,223
Oh, please.

1087
00:53:10,296 --> 00:53:13,527
Matt, as interesting
as this is,

1088
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,260
where are you taking it?

1089
00:53:15,334 --> 00:53:17,894
All right, you caught me.

1090
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:18,937
I always do.

1091
00:53:19,004 --> 00:53:21,336
I don't know why I even try.

1092
00:53:23,442 --> 00:53:25,637
I'll deny
I ever said this, but...

1093
00:53:26,879 --> 00:53:28,710
...I miss my sister.

1094
00:53:28,781 --> 00:53:30,544
There. I said it.

1095
00:53:30,616 --> 00:53:32,379
Now you know.

1096
00:53:33,419 --> 00:53:36,115
I know I rag on her
all the time,

1097
00:53:36,188 --> 00:53:39,749
but now that she's gone,
I-I -

1098
00:53:39,825 --> 00:53:42,453
Oh, honey, we miss her, too.

1099
00:53:42,528 --> 00:53:44,553
So, so much.

1100
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:46,894
I feel so alone!

1101
00:53:46,966 --> 00:53:49,560
Oh! Listen to me.

1102
00:53:49,635 --> 00:53:53,093
You don't have to
make fake pie charts.

1103
00:53:53,172 --> 00:53:55,970
You just come to us
with the truth, okay?

1104
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:58,100
I know that now, Mom.

1105
00:53:59,311 --> 00:54:00,801
It's just so hard.

1106
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,074
I miss her so much!

1107
00:54:02,148 --> 00:54:03,080
Oh!

1108
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:06,480
I can't believe
I let you talk me into

1109
00:54:06,552 --> 00:54:09,612
Ietting her go
on that trip!

1110
00:54:09,688 --> 00:54:11,383
I'll go get the passports.

1111
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:12,754
Oh, honey.

1112
00:54:13,726 --> 00:54:15,023
- Shh.

1113
00:54:15,094 --> 00:54:17,221
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

1114
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,998
Ah, hmm, ah.

1115
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:26,662
Hmm.

1116
00:54:26,739 --> 00:54:28,434
Uh...

1117
00:54:28,507 --> 00:54:32,637
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmmmm.

1118
00:54:43,522 --> 00:54:44,614
Hmm?

1119
00:54:47,593 --> 00:54:48,617
Hmm.

1120
00:54:48,694 --> 00:54:49,752
Hmm!

1121
00:55:00,306 --> 00:55:02,297
- Paolo.
- Si,

1122
00:55:03,309 --> 00:55:04,537
What is this?

1123
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:06,578
Uh, a car.

1124
00:55:08,647 --> 00:55:11,810
Look, are we supposed to sing?

1125
00:55:11,884 --> 00:55:12,976
Scusa?

1126
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,584
Don't speak to me in ltalian.

1127
00:55:16,655 --> 00:55:17,986
It's too adorable.

1128
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:22,385
Are Paolo and lsabella
supposed to sing at the awards?

1129
00:55:22,461 --> 00:55:24,019
Si,

1130
00:55:24,096 --> 00:55:26,360
Si?! Well,
why didn't you tell me?

1131
00:55:26,432 --> 00:55:29,595
I wanted to, but you told me
not to telephone the hotel.

1132
00:55:29,668 --> 00:55:32,398
Get in. I'll explain
everything on the way.

1133
00:55:32,471 --> 00:55:35,702
I want to show you the
Tivoli Gardens before sunset.

1134
00:55:35,774 --> 00:55:36,763
Come on.

1135
00:55:36,842 --> 00:55:38,707
We have to get you back
by 10:00.

1136
00:55:38,777 --> 00:55:40,210
Okay.

1137
00:55:43,349 --> 00:55:45,874
So, where is Sergei?

1138
00:55:45,951 --> 00:55:49,011
You're not the only one
who sneaks off at night.

1139
00:55:58,163 --> 00:56:00,358
lsabella and I
were going to sing,

1140
00:56:00,432 --> 00:56:02,195
but after lsabella
would not speak to me,

1141
00:56:02,268 --> 00:56:04,634
I told the producers
we refuse to perform.

1142
00:56:04,703 --> 00:56:07,035
I said lsabella
had throat problems.

1143
00:56:07,106 --> 00:56:08,266
So, what happened?

1144
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,671
I mean, what changed?

1145
00:56:09,742 --> 00:56:11,175
Isabella did.

1146
00:56:11,243 --> 00:56:13,905
The real lsabella
or me lsabella?

1147
00:56:13,979 --> 00:56:16,140
You. A reporter
heard her speaking,

1148
00:56:16,215 --> 00:56:18,649
and he reported
lsabella's voice was fine.

1149
00:56:18,717 --> 00:56:20,742
He said her English
was very good.

1150
00:56:20,819 --> 00:56:22,218
The record company called,

1151
00:56:22,288 --> 00:56:24,916
and they're going to sue
if we don't sing.

1152
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:26,321
What?

1153
00:56:26,392 --> 00:56:28,383
So, they're
gonna make you sing?

1154
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,121
I-I mean, us sing?

1155
00:56:30,195 --> 00:56:32,390
Don't worry, carina,
I'll make this work.

1156
00:56:32,464 --> 00:56:33,556
Look.

1157
00:56:50,916 --> 00:56:51,905
Ah!

1158
00:56:53,018 --> 00:56:56,351
Look, Paolo, I-I don't think
this is going to work.

1159
00:56:56,422 --> 00:56:58,982
I cannot sing
in front of an audience.

1160
00:56:59,058 --> 00:57:01,959
I won't even let my mom
hear me sing in the shower.

1161
00:57:02,027 --> 00:57:04,154
I will teach you
all you need to know.

1162
00:57:04,229 --> 00:57:05,389
Okay.

1163
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:08,797
So, what is lsabella gonna do
when she sees me being her?

1164
00:57:08,867 --> 00:57:12,394
She won't. She's off on some
island trying to get over this.

1165
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:14,496
Come on.

1166
00:57:21,547 --> 00:57:23,174
Here's my vow to you.

1167
00:57:23,248 --> 00:57:24,681
I, Paolo Valisari,

1168
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:27,685
will never let you,
Lizzie McGuire, be embarrassed.

1169
00:57:27,753 --> 00:57:30,347
If I fail,
I have to spend seven days

1170
00:57:30,422 --> 00:57:32,822
with that scary
head-check woman.

1171
00:57:32,891 --> 00:57:36,122
Her name's Miss Ungermeyer.

1172
00:57:36,195 --> 00:57:39,858
Carina, hasn't everything
I've promised you come to be?

1173
00:57:39,932 --> 00:57:41,866
Everyone believes
you are lsabella.

1174
00:57:41,934 --> 00:57:43,993
You're having
the time of your life.

1175
00:57:44,069 --> 00:57:46,003
You even told
Franca di Montecatini

1176
00:57:46,071 --> 00:57:47,060
to buzz off!

1177
00:57:48,307 --> 00:57:52,243
Don't you trust that we can
do the singing together?

1178
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:56,905
I guess.

1179
00:57:56,982 --> 00:57:58,142
Well, you shouldn't.

1180
00:58:02,388 --> 00:58:07,621
Hmmm-mmmm

1181
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:09,923
Ohhh

1182
00:58:09,995 --> 00:58:12,828
Ye-e-e-ah

1183
00:58:12,898 --> 00:58:17,460
You've been searching the
world to find true love

1184
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:21,028
Looking in all
the wrong places

1185
00:58:21,106 --> 00:58:25,167
When all of the time,
you've been blind to love

1186
00:58:25,244 --> 00:58:28,907
It's plain as the nose
on your face is

1187
00:58:28,981 --> 00:58:30,972
It's here

1188
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:33,314
It's now

1189
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:36,650
Open your eyes and see it

1190
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:38,849
Right here

1191
00:58:38,924 --> 00:58:39,913
Right now

1192
00:58:39,992 --> 00:58:41,152
Ohh

1193
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:43,694
This is so beautiful.

1194
00:58:43,762 --> 00:58:45,252
Yes, you are.

1195
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:46,558
Ohhhh

1196
00:58:46,632 --> 00:58:50,398
Love has been
right by your side

1197
00:58:50,469 --> 00:58:54,929
Oh, so close,
that you couldn't see

1198
00:58:55,007 --> 00:58:58,909
If love could speak,
it would shout to the sky

1199
00:58:58,977 --> 00:59:03,471
"I've always been here,
I always will be"

1200
00:59:03,549 --> 00:59:05,039
Wow!

1201
00:59:05,117 --> 00:59:06,482
I'm here

1202
00:59:06,552 --> 00:59:07,484
I'm here

1203
00:59:07,553 --> 00:59:08,577
I'm now

1204
00:59:08,654 --> 00:59:09,780
I'm now

1205
00:59:09,855 --> 00:59:13,347
Open your eyes and see

1206
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:15,620
Right here

1207
00:59:15,694 --> 00:59:17,889
Right now

1208
00:59:17,963 --> 00:59:24,266
Open your eyes to love

1209
00:59:24,336 --> 00:59:26,566
Open your heart

1210
00:59:26,638 --> 00:59:30,631
To love

1211
00:59:47,259 --> 00:59:48,783
Hey.

1212
00:59:48,861 --> 00:59:50,761
What do you got there,
little man?

1213
00:59:50,829 --> 00:59:52,524
- Uh, nothing.
- What's this?

1214
00:59:52,598 --> 00:59:54,122
Uh, that's not Lizzie!
No!

1215
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,724
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

1216
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:58,361
I know my daughter.
I gave her that necklace.

1217
00:59:58,437 --> 01:00:01,270
All right, tell me
what you know that I don't.

1218
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:04,571
It's only
a 14-hour flight, Dad.

1219
01:00:10,115 --> 01:00:11,548
Swallow those biscotti.

1220
01:00:11,617 --> 01:00:14,484
We got a big day.
The Pantheon, the Colosseum.

1221
01:00:14,553 --> 01:00:15,485
Oh.

1222
01:00:15,554 --> 01:00:17,078
Uh, halt!

1223
01:00:17,156 --> 01:00:19,590
Got to get these apricots
to McGuire.

1224
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:22,183
She looked sick as a dog
this morning.

1225
01:00:23,262 --> 01:00:25,093
Mr. Gordon,
you having a problem?

1226
01:00:25,164 --> 01:00:26,392
N-No, I just...

1227
01:00:26,465 --> 01:00:28,399
I'm starting to agree
with Ethan.

1228
01:00:28,467 --> 01:00:30,992
- We need to eat more spaghetti.
- You da man!

1229
01:00:32,605 --> 01:00:34,163
Sorry.

1230
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,368
Is there a reason you
don't want me to go upstairs?

1231
01:00:37,443 --> 01:00:40,207
No, I-I just really think
we should get going.

1232
01:00:40,279 --> 01:00:43,407
Uh, so much Roma,
so little time-a.

1233
01:00:43,482 --> 01:00:45,507
Well, when I get upstairs -

1234
01:00:45,584 --> 01:00:48,485
and I will get upstairs -

1235
01:00:48,554 --> 01:00:51,182
I expect to find Miss McGuire
in her bed.

1236
01:00:52,491 --> 01:00:55,426
She may be in the bathroom
or - or something.

1237
01:00:55,494 --> 01:00:57,485
I'm beginning
to get the feeling

1238
01:00:57,563 --> 01:01:00,361
she was never sick
to begin with.

1239
01:01:00,432 --> 01:01:02,024
No, no, no!
She - She was!

1240
01:01:02,101 --> 01:01:04,365
I bet this whole thing
was just a clever ruse

1241
01:01:04,436 --> 01:01:07,371
to sneak out of this hotel,
wasn't it?

1242
01:01:08,607 --> 01:01:10,541
Yeah, it - it was.

1243
01:01:10,609 --> 01:01:11,906
It was?

1244
01:01:11,977 --> 01:01:15,538
Well, Lizzie and I were
talking about adventures,

1245
01:01:15,614 --> 01:01:16,706
and I don't know.

1246
01:01:16,782 --> 01:01:18,374
Ah, spit it out, Gordon.

1247
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:21,044
Lizzie's upstairs.
It - It's me.

1248
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,111
I'm the one
who's been sneaking out.

1249
01:01:23,188 --> 01:01:25,053
- You?
- But - But -

1250
01:01:25,858 --> 01:01:28,691
Feels good
to get it off my chest.

1251
01:01:29,595 --> 01:01:31,495
You realize
what this means?

1252
01:01:32,498 --> 01:01:36,491
I shouldn't look to you
for a college recommendation?

1253
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:39,469
You should look
for your suitcase, Gordon.

1254
01:01:39,538 --> 01:01:40,800
You're goin' home.

1255
01:01:40,873 --> 01:01:43,808
Oh, I pegged you
right from the start.

1256
01:01:43,876 --> 01:01:45,104
David Gordon.

1257
01:01:45,177 --> 01:01:48,169
Sneaky little brownnoser
with a hidden agenda.

1258
01:01:49,181 --> 01:01:51,012
Well, you're busted.

1259
01:01:55,487 --> 01:01:58,251
Love lifts us up
where we belong.

1260
01:02:09,001 --> 01:02:11,697
Wow.
This place is so cool.

1261
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:12,930
Si,

1262
01:02:13,005 --> 01:02:14,939
Are you sure it's okay
we're here?

1263
01:02:15,007 --> 01:02:15,974
Si,

1264
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:18,305
And here is where, exactly?

1265
01:02:18,377 --> 01:02:19,776
It's the rehearsal hall.

1266
01:02:19,845 --> 01:02:22,439
But the Colosseum
will look more like this.

1267
01:02:22,514 --> 01:02:23,572
Sergei!

1268
01:02:29,588 --> 01:02:31,988
If you want to convince
the world you're lsabella,

1269
01:02:32,057 --> 01:02:33,422
you must take the stage.

1270
01:02:33,492 --> 01:02:34,584
You must dance...

1271
01:02:38,263 --> 01:02:39,696
...and sing.

1272
01:02:42,434 --> 01:02:48,270
Have you ever seen
such a beautiful night?

1273
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:50,365
Just move your mouth
with the words.

1274
01:02:50,442 --> 01:02:52,706
Oh. So you want me
to lip-synch.

1275
01:02:52,778 --> 01:02:53,904
- Si,

1276
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:55,139
Just like lsabella.

1277
01:02:55,214 --> 01:02:56,875
You know the song, right?

1278
01:02:56,949 --> 01:03:00,350
Uh, well, yeah.
I mean, I have your CD, but...

1279
01:03:00,419 --> 01:03:02,353
So try it.

1280
01:03:02,421 --> 01:03:03,979
I'm not gonna try it.

1281
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:11,022
- Okay.

1282
01:03:12,264 --> 01:03:18,260
Have you ever seen
such a beautiful night?

1283
01:03:20,572 --> 01:03:27,501
I could almost kiss the stars
for shining so bright

1284
01:03:30,616 --> 01:03:32,607
Was it awful?

1285
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:34,914
- Uh, yes.

1286
01:03:34,987 --> 01:03:36,420
But it helps to sing.

1287
01:03:36,488 --> 01:03:38,422
Really - really sing?

1288
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:40,958
It looks more real
when you're lip-synching.

1289
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:43,893
- You weren't singing.
- But I won't be lip-synching.

1290
01:03:43,962 --> 01:03:47,090
No one's going to hear you.
The microphone will be off.

1291
01:03:47,166 --> 01:03:48,428
You must try.

1292
01:03:49,334 --> 01:03:50,426
Please?

1293
01:03:52,171 --> 01:03:53,229
Okay.

1294
01:03:59,678 --> 01:04:05,674
Have you ever seen
such a beautiful night?

1295
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:14,621
I could almost kiss the stars
for shining so bright

1296
01:04:16,295 --> 01:04:19,230
When I see you smiling

1297
01:04:19,298 --> 01:04:23,792
I go, "Oh, oh, oh"

1298
01:04:25,003 --> 01:04:29,440
I would never want
to miss this

1299
01:04:29,508 --> 01:04:35,242
'Cause in my heart
I know what this is

1300
01:04:36,248 --> 01:04:42,084
This is what dreams
are made of

1301
01:04:44,456 --> 01:04:46,424
This is what

1302
01:04:46,492 --> 01:04:49,256
Dreams are made of

1303
01:04:49,328 --> 01:04:50,556
I've got

1304
01:04:50,629 --> 01:04:53,496
Somewhere I belong

1305
01:04:53,565 --> 01:04:54,827
I've got

1306
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:57,664
Somebody to love

1307
01:04:57,736 --> 01:04:58,703
This is what

1308
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:02,536
Dreams

1309
01:05:02,608 --> 01:05:07,068
Are made of

1310
01:05:10,749 --> 01:05:12,341
Brava.

1311
01:05:12,417 --> 01:05:14,282
And now we dance!

1312
01:05:21,159 --> 01:05:22,148
Hey!

1313
01:05:28,634 --> 01:05:30,124
Hey!

1314
01:05:36,675 --> 01:05:37,733
Hey!

1315
01:05:47,252 --> 01:05:49,311
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

1316
01:05:50,522 --> 01:05:52,353
Hey!

1317
01:05:52,424 --> 01:05:53,755
Hey!

1318
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:54,917
Hey!

1319
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:57,689
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

1320
01:06:20,419 --> 01:06:21,351
Hey!

1321
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:24,218
I'm glad you're up.
I had the most amazing night.

1322
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:26,986
I'm gonna grab Gordo
so I can tell you together.

1323
01:06:27,059 --> 01:06:28,253
You won't find him.

1324
01:06:28,327 --> 01:06:30,056
What?

1325
01:06:30,129 --> 01:06:31,426
Why? Where'd he go?

1326
01:06:31,497 --> 01:06:34,398
Probably getting on a plane
right now.

1327
01:06:34,467 --> 01:06:35,559
Why?

1328
01:06:35,634 --> 01:06:37,124
He totally covered for you

1329
01:06:37,203 --> 01:06:39,262
and got himself
kicked off the trip.

1330
01:06:39,338 --> 01:06:41,431
I-I don't believe it.

1331
01:06:41,507 --> 01:06:43,270
W-Why would he do that?

1332
01:06:43,342 --> 01:06:46,243
You're seriously asking
that question?

1333
01:06:52,785 --> 01:06:56,221
Call the airline and see
if Gordo's plane has left!

1334
01:06:56,288 --> 01:06:58,813
- Do you know what flight?
- Si, si,

1335
01:06:58,891 --> 01:07:00,415
I will call.

1336
01:07:01,427 --> 01:07:03,895
I cannot believe Gordo
would do this for me.

1337
01:07:03,963 --> 01:07:05,624
Maybe he's not
on the plane yet.

1338
01:07:05,698 --> 01:07:08,030
Maybe I could go
to the airport and...

1339
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:09,431
And what?

1340
01:07:11,003 --> 01:07:12,698
I don't know.

1341
01:07:12,805 --> 01:07:15,365
I am now on hold.

1342
01:07:15,441 --> 01:07:19,207
This is the final call
for Lufthansa Flight 6240,

1343
01:07:19,278 --> 01:07:22,736
departing for Los Angeles.

1344
01:07:28,687 --> 01:07:30,154
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1345
01:07:34,193 --> 01:07:36,286
Mm-hmm.

1346
01:07:36,362 --> 01:07:39,126
Mm-hmm.

1347
01:07:39,198 --> 01:07:41,098
Mm-hmm.

1348
01:07:41,167 --> 01:07:42,225
Mm-hmm.

1349
01:07:42,301 --> 01:07:44,166
Mm-hmm.

1350
01:07:44,236 --> 01:07:46,227
Mm-hmm.

1351
01:07:46,305 --> 01:07:48,967
Thank you very nice.

1352
01:07:49,041 --> 01:07:50,474
The plane is gone.

1353
01:08:24,076 --> 01:08:25,338
Who is this girl?

1354
01:08:25,411 --> 01:08:27,174
I have been on the island,

1355
01:08:27,246 --> 01:08:29,771
trying to forget
about this whole situation.

1356
01:08:29,849 --> 01:08:32,113
Can somebody tell me
what is going on?

1357
01:08:32,184 --> 01:08:34,982
I can. That's my friend
Lizzie McGuire.

1358
01:08:37,890 --> 01:08:39,152
Let him go.
Let him go.

1359
01:08:39,225 --> 01:08:41,591
I demand you tell me
everything you know

1360
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:42,820
about Lizzie McGuire.

1361
01:08:42,895 --> 01:08:47,355
I demand you tell me everything
about Paolo Valisari.

1362
01:08:47,433 --> 01:08:50,425
I left him and all thoughts
about him on the island.

1363
01:08:50,503 --> 01:08:52,494
You may have left him
on the island,

1364
01:08:52,571 --> 01:08:54,698
but Lizzie is out there
pretending to be you

1365
01:08:54,773 --> 01:08:56,400
so you don't get sued.

1366
01:08:58,277 --> 01:09:00,245
We need to talk in private.

1367
01:09:01,914 --> 01:09:04,644
Gordo's life is ruined
because of me.

1368
01:09:04,717 --> 01:09:06,480
Selfish me!

1369
01:09:06,552 --> 01:09:08,019
What are you gonna do now?

1370
01:09:08,087 --> 01:09:09,850
It's over.

1371
01:09:09,922 --> 01:09:12,652
I'm going to turn myself in
to Miss Ungermeyer.

1372
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:16,023
Lizzie, you'll get sent home,

1373
01:09:16,095 --> 01:09:18,086
and you won't be able
to help Paolo.

1374
01:09:18,164 --> 01:09:19,756
I'm never going to be able

1375
01:09:19,832 --> 01:09:22,323
to get through this
the way I feel now.

1376
01:09:22,401 --> 01:09:24,164
Okay. Fine. Quit.

1377
01:09:24,236 --> 01:09:27,262
But then everything Gordo did
will be for nothing.

1378
01:09:30,176 --> 01:09:34,943
Now, you know things are bad
when Kate starts making sense.

1379
01:09:35,014 --> 01:09:36,606
I know one thing's for sure.

1380
01:09:36,682 --> 01:09:37,774
What?

1381
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:40,080
I'm not gonna have to
act sick today.

1382
01:10:12,785 --> 01:10:16,118
Mr. Craft, you are in
the most historic

1383
01:10:16,188 --> 01:10:18,383
and beautiful city
in the world.

1384
01:10:18,457 --> 01:10:20,288
Has it had no effect on you?

1385
01:10:20,359 --> 01:10:21,656
Well, actually, it has.

1386
01:10:21,727 --> 01:10:24,025
The cobblestones
are shredding my wheels.

1387
01:10:24,096 --> 01:10:26,621
Switched to a pair
of birdhouse pterodactyls.

1388
01:10:26,699 --> 01:10:30,066
Have you even made a dent
in your reading list?

1389
01:10:30,135 --> 01:10:31,625
I finished it.

1390
01:10:31,704 --> 01:10:33,467
You read 11 books?

1391
01:10:33,539 --> 01:10:35,734
I mean I read the list.

1392
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:45,747
Shh.

1393
01:10:48,187 --> 01:10:49,586
Shh.

1394
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:53,023
McGuire.

1395
01:10:53,092 --> 01:10:54,855
Lizzie McGuire.

1396
01:10:54,927 --> 01:10:57,987
Si, si, we are in
the travel guides.

1397
01:10:58,063 --> 01:10:59,325
No. No.

1398
01:10:59,398 --> 01:11:00,888
No.

1399
01:11:01,934 --> 01:11:04,869
We're the parents of Lizzie.

1400
01:11:04,937 --> 01:11:06,199
Ah! Si!

1401
01:11:09,441 --> 01:11:11,705
I'll call a cab.
It's very far.

1402
01:11:11,777 --> 01:11:14,143
Anybody else want to step up
to the plate?

1403
01:11:14,213 --> 01:11:16,477
Who's asking for McGuire?

1404
01:11:16,548 --> 01:11:18,539
I had left you
four messages already,

1405
01:11:18,617 --> 01:11:22,018
but she's been under
my watchful eye all the while.

1406
01:11:22,087 --> 01:11:24,021
Where'd Sanders go?

1407
01:11:24,089 --> 01:11:26,614
Lizzie? Sweetheart?

1408
01:11:26,692 --> 01:11:28,557
Honey?

1409
01:11:29,728 --> 01:11:31,218
Cool!

1410
01:11:35,401 --> 01:11:36,595
Where is Lizzie?

1411
01:11:36,669 --> 01:11:38,637
Do you have
any embarrassing photos

1412
01:11:38,704 --> 01:11:40,831
or videos of her
while she's been here?

1413
01:11:40,906 --> 01:11:42,100
Ow.

1414
01:11:42,174 --> 01:11:43,141
Uh...

1415
01:11:43,208 --> 01:11:46,609
Tell us where Lizzie is,
or this deck's gonna catch air.

1416
01:11:46,679 --> 01:11:50,046
It's possible she's at the
International Music Video Awards

1417
01:11:50,115 --> 01:11:53,414
doubling for pop star lsabella,
who's totally her twin.

1418
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:57,753
Why does everyone
always look at me like that?

1419
01:12:02,294 --> 01:12:06,560
When you wish upon a star

1420
01:12:06,632 --> 01:12:09,192
Your dreams will take you
very far

1421
01:12:11,070 --> 01:12:14,039
Once you see your light
so clear

1422
01:12:15,908 --> 01:12:20,436
In the sky so very dear

1423
01:12:20,512 --> 01:12:22,503
You're a shining star

1424
01:12:22,581 --> 01:12:25,175
No matter who you are

1425
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:27,582
Shining bright to see

1426
01:12:27,653 --> 01:12:29,416
What you can truly be

1427
01:12:31,824 --> 01:12:33,416
Prince William?

1428
01:12:33,492 --> 01:12:36,086
Tell him he'll have to hold.

1429
01:12:43,869 --> 01:12:44,961
Ooh!

1430
01:12:45,037 --> 01:12:46,629
- Oh.

1431
01:12:50,476 --> 01:12:54,071
Shine its watchful light
on you

1432
01:12:54,146 --> 01:12:56,046
Hey, Paolo!

1433
01:13:00,619 --> 01:13:03,918
Words of wisdom,
yes, I can

1434
01:13:05,157 --> 01:13:07,250
You're a shining star

1435
01:13:07,326 --> 01:13:09,851
No matter who you are

1436
01:13:09,928 --> 01:13:12,021
Shining bright to see

1437
01:13:12,097 --> 01:13:14,224
What you can truly be

1438
01:13:24,576 --> 01:13:25,543
Si,

1439
01:13:25,611 --> 01:13:26,373
What?

1440
01:13:26,445 --> 01:13:28,572
He said for you to enter
from here, stage right,

1441
01:13:28,647 --> 01:13:31,673
and I must enter
from stage left.

1442
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:34,412
What about my dress?
I have to get dressed.

1443
01:13:34,486 --> 01:13:36,113
It's in your dressing room.

1444
01:13:36,188 --> 01:13:38,486
Lizzie, you have time.

1445
01:13:38,557 --> 01:13:40,218
Calm down.
You can do it.

1446
01:13:41,226 --> 01:13:43,057
Of course I can do it.

1447
01:13:44,062 --> 01:13:46,326
This is moi
we're talking about.

1448
01:13:46,398 --> 01:13:48,161
I don't think I can do it.

1449
01:13:48,233 --> 01:13:49,666
Lizzie, you must.

1450
01:13:49,735 --> 01:13:52,727
We've rehearsed this.
You know the steps, the words.

1451
01:13:52,838 --> 01:13:55,432
You will be great.
I know.

1452
01:13:55,507 --> 01:13:56,804
How do you know?

1453
01:13:56,875 --> 01:13:59,070
Because.

1454
01:13:59,144 --> 01:14:01,874
Because you shine
like the light from the sun.

1455
01:14:07,519 --> 01:14:09,487
Paolo. Paolo.

1456
01:14:09,555 --> 01:14:12,718
31 minutes till showtime.

1457
01:14:14,626 --> 01:14:16,059
Lizzie.

1458
01:14:16,128 --> 01:14:18,392
Gordo!
What are you doing here?!

1459
01:14:18,464 --> 01:14:21,160
Lizzie, that's
not important right now.

1460
01:14:21,233 --> 01:14:22,860
You need to listen to me.

1461
01:14:22,935 --> 01:14:26,371
I feel so bad. I cannot believe
you would do that for me.

1462
01:14:26,438 --> 01:14:28,338
- Why aren't you gone?
- Long story.

1463
01:14:28,407 --> 01:14:31,399
I want to hear it, but
I've got to get my dress on.

1464
01:14:31,477 --> 01:14:32,409
Listen to me.

1465
01:14:32,478 --> 01:14:34,708
Paolo is setting you up.

1466
01:14:35,914 --> 01:14:37,677
What are you talking about?

1467
01:14:37,749 --> 01:14:40,343
Actually, he is setting me up.

1468
01:14:46,358 --> 01:14:47,950
Freaky, huh?

1469
01:14:48,026 --> 01:14:49,857
Way freaky.

1470
01:14:49,928 --> 01:14:52,226
Way, way freaky.

1471
01:14:52,297 --> 01:14:55,130
That whole story
about Paolo doing his own music

1472
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,428
and going solo.

1473
01:14:56,502 --> 01:14:57,833
That's lsabella.

1474
01:14:57,903 --> 01:14:59,666
She's the one that sings live.

1475
01:14:59,738 --> 01:15:02,536
Paolo is the one
that lip-synchs, not me.

1476
01:15:02,608 --> 01:15:04,838
Isabella wants to quit the act.

1477
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:06,207
Paolo is just a liar.

1478
01:15:06,278 --> 01:15:08,746
This has all been some scheme
to set you up

1479
01:15:08,814 --> 01:15:10,213
and embarrass you onstage

1480
01:15:10,282 --> 01:15:12,341
so it looks
like lsabella can't sing.

1481
01:15:12,417 --> 01:15:13,907
Si, si, It's true.

1482
01:15:13,986 --> 01:15:16,352
Paolo wants to destroy
lsabella's career.

1483
01:15:17,823 --> 01:15:21,384
But Paolo would never
do that to me.

1484
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:22,722
I don't believe you.

1485
01:15:24,329 --> 01:15:25,762
Isabella...

1486
01:15:29,768 --> 01:15:32,259
Lizzie, who are you
going to believe,

1487
01:15:32,337 --> 01:15:34,567
this boy you are knowing
your whole life

1488
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:38,599
or this boy you are
just meeting who says,

1489
01:15:38,677 --> 01:15:40,975
"You shine with the light
from the sun"?

1490
01:16:14,713 --> 01:16:17,705
Okay. Well, then, you're here
now, so go and sing.

1491
01:16:17,783 --> 01:16:20,718
But I am not blond.
Paolo will know that it's me,

1492
01:16:20,786 --> 01:16:22,913
and he'll make an excuse
to leave.

1493
01:16:22,988 --> 01:16:24,979
But if we want to
get back at him

1494
01:16:25,057 --> 01:16:27,321
in front of the whole world
on live TV,

1495
01:16:27,392 --> 01:16:28,654
we must make him sing.

1496
01:16:28,727 --> 01:16:30,695
And really sing, not lip-synch.

1497
01:16:30,762 --> 01:16:32,457
How? What am I
supposed to do?

1498
01:16:32,531 --> 01:16:35,591
- I can't sing live!

1499
01:16:35,667 --> 01:16:37,225
Change! Change!

1500
01:16:37,302 --> 01:16:38,360
Change your clothes

1501
01:16:38,437 --> 01:16:40,769
and go up there and do
what you rehearsed.

1502
01:16:40,839 --> 01:16:42,966
Everything will be fine,
I-I promise.

1503
01:16:43,041 --> 01:16:44,941
- I have a plan.
- What plan?

1504
01:16:45,010 --> 01:16:46,739
28 minutes till showtime.

1505
01:16:46,812 --> 01:16:48,746
So, what's the plan?

1506
01:16:48,814 --> 01:16:50,042
I don't know.

1507
01:16:51,617 --> 01:16:54,177
No, see, it doesn't matter
about the tickets,

1508
01:16:54,252 --> 01:16:56,584
because my daughter
is back there

1509
01:16:56,655 --> 01:16:58,418
impersonating
a famous pop star,

1510
01:16:58,490 --> 01:16:59,752
so I got to get in!

1511
01:16:59,825 --> 01:17:01,315
That's what everyone says.

1512
01:17:01,393 --> 01:17:02,325
Enough of this!

1513
01:17:06,398 --> 01:17:07,490
- Uhh!
- Uhh!

1514
01:17:07,566 --> 01:17:08,999
Let's go!

1515
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:14,830
Did Paolo bring
the voice track for me?

1516
01:17:14,906 --> 01:17:17,374
No. No, he did not.
There is no track.

1517
01:17:17,442 --> 01:17:20,536
Paolo says you're gonna sing
live, like you always do.

1518
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:25,477
Paolo and lsabella!

1519
01:17:37,095 --> 01:17:38,995
Sandro, turn down
lsabella's mike.

1520
01:17:39,064 --> 01:17:40,998
- What's that?
- Turn down the mike!

1521
01:17:50,575 --> 01:17:56,571
Have you ever seen
such a beautiful night?

1522
01:17:59,017 --> 01:18:04,614
I could almost kiss the stars
for shining so bright

1523
01:18:07,426 --> 01:18:11,192
When I see you smiling,
I go

1524
01:18:11,263 --> 01:18:14,096
"Oh, oh, oh"

1525
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:19,696
I would never want
to miss this

1526
01:18:19,771 --> 01:18:21,762
'Cause in my heart

1527
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,933
I know what this is

1528
01:18:26,845 --> 01:18:32,283
This is what dreams
are made of

1529
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:34,147
Sing to me, Paolo.

1530
01:18:35,554 --> 01:18:40,491
This is
what dreams are made of

1531
01:18:58,577 --> 01:19:00,306
Okay.

1532
01:19:01,847 --> 01:19:05,578
Say buonasera to my new American
friend, Lizzie McGuire!

1533
01:19:07,018 --> 01:19:09,145
Paolo tried to use her
to fool all of you

1534
01:19:09,221 --> 01:19:11,018
into thinking I could not sing.

1535
01:19:11,089 --> 01:19:13,785
Lizzie McGuire is nice girl.
You try to hurt her.

1536
01:19:13,859 --> 01:19:15,986
Let me go, Sergei.
You work for me.

1537
01:19:16,061 --> 01:19:18,188
Not anymore, Paolo.
I quit.

1538
01:19:18,263 --> 01:19:19,195
Paolo!

1539
01:19:20,499 --> 01:19:24,526
Paolo cannot sing music.
Now he must face music.

1540
01:19:24,603 --> 01:19:27,003
- Was it all a lie?
- No, it's just...

1541
01:19:27,072 --> 01:19:30,166
- Do you want to hear us sing?

1542
01:19:40,352 --> 01:19:45,790
Have you ever seen
such a beautiful night?

1543
01:19:48,026 --> 01:19:53,828
I could almost kiss the stars
for shining so bright

1544
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:59,534
When I see you smiling,
I go

1545
01:19:59,604 --> 01:20:02,732
"Oh, oh, oh"

1546
01:20:02,808 --> 01:20:07,245
I would never want
to miss this

1547
01:20:07,312 --> 01:20:10,713
'Cause in my heart
I know what this is

1548
01:20:10,782 --> 01:20:11,908
Hey, now

1549
01:20:11,983 --> 01:20:13,416
Hey, now

1550
01:20:13,485 --> 01:20:18,252
This is what dreams
are made of

1551
01:20:18,323 --> 01:20:19,415
Hey, now

1552
01:20:19,491 --> 01:20:20,822
Hey, now

1553
01:20:20,892 --> 01:20:24,851
This is what dreams
are made of

1554
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:28,593
I've got
somewhere I belong

1555
01:20:28,667 --> 01:20:32,364
I've got
somebody to love

1556
01:20:32,437 --> 01:20:36,203
This is what dre-e-e-ams

1557
01:20:36,274 --> 01:20:38,902
Are made of

1558
01:20:40,812 --> 01:20:42,279
Wait! Isabella!

1559
01:20:42,347 --> 01:20:43,541
Go! Si!

1560
01:20:45,917 --> 01:20:47,077
Lizzie!

1561
01:20:50,188 --> 01:20:52,053
Ru-u-u-u-n!

1562
01:20:58,797 --> 01:21:00,992
Hey, hey, hey!

1563
01:21:01,066 --> 01:21:06,732
Have you ever wondered
what life is about?

1564
01:21:08,907 --> 01:21:14,402
You could search the world
and never figure it out

1565
01:21:16,214 --> 01:21:19,809
You don't have to sail
the oceans

1566
01:21:19,885 --> 01:21:22,649
No, no, no

1567
01:21:24,055 --> 01:21:26,649
Happiness is no mystery

1568
01:21:26,725 --> 01:21:29,057
It's here and now

1569
01:21:29,127 --> 01:21:31,755
It's you and me, yeah

1570
01:21:33,498 --> 01:21:35,898
Hey, now, hey, now

1571
01:21:35,967 --> 01:21:39,994
This is what dreams
are made of

1572
01:21:40,972 --> 01:21:43,270
Hey, now, hey, now

1573
01:21:43,341 --> 01:21:47,243
This is what dreams
are made of

1574
01:21:47,312 --> 01:21:50,839
I've got somewhere I belong

1575
01:21:50,916 --> 01:21:54,613
I've got somebody to love

1576
01:21:54,686 --> 01:21:58,452
This is what dre-e-e-ams

1577
01:21:58,523 --> 01:22:00,514
Are made of

1578
01:22:00,592 --> 01:22:02,116
Hey, now

1579
01:22:02,193 --> 01:22:05,526
This is what dreams
are made of

1580
01:22:05,597 --> 01:22:07,155
Hey, hey, hey, hey

1581
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:08,221
Hey, now

1582
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:10,131
Hey, now

1583
01:22:10,201 --> 01:22:14,297
This is what dreams
are made of

1584
01:22:15,073 --> 01:22:17,473
Open your eyes

1585
01:22:17,542 --> 01:22:21,535
This is what dreams
are made of

1586
01:22:22,347 --> 01:22:24,907
Shout to the skies

1587
01:22:24,983 --> 01:22:27,508
This is what dreams
are made of

1588
01:22:27,585 --> 01:22:29,610
Hey, hey, hey, hey

1589
01:22:29,688 --> 01:22:31,747
Then I see you smile

1590
01:22:31,823 --> 01:22:36,351
And I go, "Oh, oh, oh"

1591
01:22:37,595 --> 01:22:41,053
Yesterday
my life was duller

1592
01:22:41,132 --> 01:22:44,898
Now everything
is technicolor

1593
01:22:48,707 --> 01:22:50,971
Hey, now, hey, now

1594
01:22:51,042 --> 01:22:54,978
This is what dreams
are made of

1595
01:22:56,815 --> 01:22:58,840
Hey, now, hey, now

1596
01:22:58,883 --> 01:23:02,979
This is what dreams
are made of

1597
01:23:03,054 --> 01:23:06,285
I've got somewhere I belong

1598
01:23:06,358 --> 01:23:10,454
I've got somebody to love

1599
01:23:10,528 --> 01:23:15,022
This is what dre-e-e-ams

1600
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:18,160
Dre-e-e-ams

1601
01:23:18,236 --> 01:23:21,728
This is what dre-e-e-ams

1602
01:23:21,806 --> 01:23:22,898
Are made of

1603
01:23:22,974 --> 01:23:24,407
Hey, now, hey, now

1604
01:23:24,476 --> 01:23:26,444
Hey, hey, hey, hey

1605
01:23:26,511 --> 01:23:28,274
Hey, now, hey, now

1606
01:23:28,346 --> 01:23:30,541
Hey, hey, hey, hey

1607
01:23:30,615 --> 01:23:32,207
Hey, now, hey, now

1608
01:23:32,283 --> 01:23:34,444
Hey, hey, hey, hey

1609
01:23:34,519 --> 01:23:35,952
Hey, now, hey, now

1610
01:23:36,021 --> 01:23:37,921
Hey, hey, hey, hey

1611
01:23:37,989 --> 01:23:39,013
Hey!

1612
01:24:37,682 --> 01:24:40,150
Lizzie got everything
you're supposed to get

1613
01:24:40,218 --> 01:24:41,776
when you go to Europe.

1614
01:24:41,853 --> 01:24:44,287
Adventure, romance,
total confidence.

1615
01:24:44,355 --> 01:24:45,481
Yeah?

1616
01:24:45,556 --> 01:24:49,322
Well, if all that can happen
to Lizzie McGuire,

1617
01:24:49,393 --> 01:24:53,523
the only thing I know now is
I don't know anything.

1618
01:24:53,598 --> 01:24:55,190
That's hot.

1619
01:24:55,266 --> 01:24:56,733
What?

1620
01:24:56,801 --> 01:25:00,202
Girls who think they know
everything are just a turnoff.

1621
01:25:01,639 --> 01:25:02,765
Really?

1622
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:04,364
Oh, totally.

1623
01:25:04,442 --> 01:25:06,637
What about you
not ratting out Lizzie?

1624
01:25:06,711 --> 01:25:10,772
I mean,
that was just so...

1625
01:25:10,848 --> 01:25:12,179
not you.

1626
01:25:26,697 --> 01:25:27,891
That's good.

1627
01:25:27,965 --> 01:25:28,897
Si,

1628
01:25:28,966 --> 01:25:30,797
Aaaaaaah!

1629
01:25:33,905 --> 01:25:36,271
Mom, Dad, I'm so glad
that you guys made it.

1630
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:38,001
You would have never
believed me.

1631
01:25:38,075 --> 01:25:39,064
That is for sure.

1632
01:25:39,143 --> 01:25:42,601
I thought after you found out
all I did, I would be grounded.

1633
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:45,513
You're grounded for the rest
of the summer, sweetheart,

1634
01:25:45,583 --> 01:25:47,517
but we're really proud of you.

1635
01:25:51,055 --> 01:25:54,115
Lying, even for a good reason,
is beneath you, Gordon.

1636
01:25:54,192 --> 01:25:55,625
Yeah. I know. I know.

1637
01:25:55,693 --> 01:25:58,560
I'm a lying, spineless,
brownnosing jellyfish

1638
01:25:58,629 --> 01:25:59,857
with a hidden agenda.

1639
01:25:59,931 --> 01:26:00,898
I got it.

1640
01:26:00,965 --> 01:26:03,559
That may be true,
but I'll tell you something.

1641
01:26:03,634 --> 01:26:05,659
Little Miss Diva
told me everything.

1642
01:26:05,770 --> 01:26:09,171
The way I see it, you're
a pretty loyal friend, Gordon.

1643
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:12,232
And loyalty goes a long way
with the Ungermeyer.

1644
01:26:12,310 --> 01:26:13,402
- Hmm?
- Thanks.

1645
01:26:18,516 --> 01:26:20,006
Hey, just think about it.

1646
01:26:20,084 --> 01:26:23,383
We got 4 years of high school
to look forward to together.

1647
01:26:23,454 --> 01:26:24,751
Ooh. Sammies.

1648
01:26:26,991 --> 01:26:28,424
Sergei is hungry.

1649
01:26:28,492 --> 01:26:30,824
So is Miss Ungermeyer.

1650
01:26:33,865 --> 01:26:35,799
You are strong woman.

1651
01:26:35,867 --> 01:26:38,961
You protect cubs like lioness.

1652
01:26:39,036 --> 01:26:40,731
Sergei is impressed.

1653
01:26:40,805 --> 01:26:44,070
Hmm. You're still on my list.

1654
01:26:44,141 --> 01:26:46,166
As long as I am at the top.

1655
01:26:48,646 --> 01:26:50,238
Hey, there!

1656
01:26:50,314 --> 01:26:53,442
I bet you're wondering,
who is this Lizzie McGuire,

1657
01:26:53,517 --> 01:26:54,848
where did she come from,

1658
01:26:54,919 --> 01:26:57,547
and what are her
most embarrassing moments?

1659
01:26:57,622 --> 01:27:02,082
Well, I can give you
total access to all of that

1660
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:04,753
for a very competitive price.

1661
01:27:04,829 --> 01:27:06,729
Hmm. When in Rome...

1662
01:27:06,797 --> 01:27:09,322
Yeah, yeah.
Do as the Romans do, right?

1663
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:10,332
No.

1664
01:27:10,401 --> 01:27:13,131
We do not blackmail
our sisters.

1665
01:27:13,204 --> 01:27:15,764
As a former commander
in the ltalian Navy,

1666
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:19,003
I am ordering you
to leave the country.

1667
01:27:19,076 --> 01:27:20,065
No!

1668
01:27:27,885 --> 01:27:29,216
Hey.

1669
01:27:31,923 --> 01:27:36,360
So, one last sneak-away
for old times' sake?

1670
01:27:36,427 --> 01:27:37,860
Yeah. Sounds good.

1671
01:27:37,929 --> 01:27:39,863
Okay.

1672
01:27:41,866 --> 01:27:42,798
Aha.

1673
01:27:42,867 --> 01:27:44,960
No!

1674
01:27:51,208 --> 01:27:53,301
So, are you gonna miss it here?

1675
01:27:53,377 --> 01:27:54,469
I don't know.

1676
01:27:54,545 --> 01:27:57,673
Kate says I should stay
and have my stuff shipped over,

1677
01:27:57,748 --> 01:28:00,342
because when I leave,
it'll never be the same.

1678
01:28:00,417 --> 01:28:01,714
She's wrong, as usual.

1679
01:28:01,786 --> 01:28:04,619
You didn't have to be in Rome
for all this to happen.

1680
01:28:04,688 --> 01:28:06,246
You think?

1681
01:28:06,323 --> 01:28:07,654
Trust me.

1682
01:28:07,725 --> 01:28:09,818
You had it in you
the whole time.

1683
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:16,265
Gordo?

1684
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:17,823
What?

1685
01:28:24,275 --> 01:28:25,867
Thanks.

1686
01:28:25,943 --> 01:28:28,104
You're welcome.

1687
01:28:31,816 --> 01:28:32,748
Yeah.

1688
01:28:32,817 --> 01:28:35,718
So, um, want to get back
to that party

1689
01:28:35,786 --> 01:28:37,777
so we don't get
in any more trouble?

1690
01:28:37,855 --> 01:28:40,085
Yeah. I can't afford
any more trouble.

1691
01:28:40,157 --> 01:28:41,317
Yeah.

1692
01:29:18,095 --> 01:29:21,087
Why not?

1693
01:29:21,165 --> 01:29:22,928
Think you're goin' nowhere

1694
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,298
When you're walkin'
down the street

1695
01:29:25,369 --> 01:29:27,360
Acting like
you just don't care

1696
01:29:27,438 --> 01:29:29,133
When life can be so sweet

1697
01:29:29,206 --> 01:29:31,333
But why you want to be
like that

1698
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:33,171
As if there's nothing new?

1699
01:29:33,244 --> 01:29:34,939
You're not foolin' no one

1700
01:29:35,012 --> 01:29:37,105
You're not even foolin' you

1701
01:29:37,181 --> 01:29:41,174
So walk a little slower
and open up your eyes

1702
01:29:41,252 --> 01:29:45,348
Sometimes it's so hard to see
the good things passin' by

1703
01:29:45,422 --> 01:29:49,188
And there may never be a
sign, no flashing neon light

1704
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:53,287
Telling you to make your move
when the time is right

1705
01:29:53,364 --> 01:29:55,559
Why not

1706
01:29:55,633 --> 01:29:57,396
Take a crazy chance?

1707
01:29:57,468 --> 01:29:59,595
Why not

1708
01:29:59,670 --> 01:30:01,433
Do a crazy dance?

1709
01:30:01,505 --> 01:30:05,271
If you lose the moment,
you might lose a lot

1710
01:30:05,342 --> 01:30:07,606
So why not?

1711
01:30:07,678 --> 01:30:09,612
Why not?

1712
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:13,673
Oh, I could be
the one for you

1713
01:30:13,751 --> 01:30:17,687
Oh, yeah,
maybe yes, maybe no

1714
01:30:17,755 --> 01:30:22,021
Oh, it could be
the thing to do

1715
01:30:22,092 --> 01:30:26,188
What I'm sayin' is you got to
let me know, oh, oh

1716
01:30:26,263 --> 01:30:27,525
Ah, ah, yeah

1717
01:30:27,598 --> 01:30:29,031
Ah, ah, ah

1718
01:30:29,099 --> 01:30:32,330
Yeah, yeah

1719
01:30:33,938 --> 01:30:35,701
Ah, ah, ah, yeah

1720
01:30:35,773 --> 01:30:36,865
Ah, yeah

1721
01:30:36,941 --> 01:30:40,274
Ah, yeah, yeah

1722
01:30:41,779 --> 01:30:45,715
You'll never get to heaven
or even to L,A,

1723
01:30:45,783 --> 01:30:50,049
If you don't believe
there's a way

1724
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:52,054
Why not

1725
01:30:52,122 --> 01:30:54,056
Take a star from the sky?

1726
01:30:54,124 --> 01:30:56,115
Why not

1727
01:30:56,193 --> 01:30:58,127
Spread your wings and fly?

1728
01:30:58,195 --> 01:31:01,858
It might take a little,
and it might take a lot

1729
01:31:01,932 --> 01:31:04,025
But why not?

1730
01:31:04,101 --> 01:31:06,035
Why not?

1731
01:31:06,103 --> 01:31:08,367
Why not

1732
01:31:08,439 --> 01:31:10,031
Take a crazy chance?

1733
01:31:10,107 --> 01:31:12,166
Why not

1734
01:31:12,242 --> 01:31:14,005
Do a crazy dance?

1735
01:31:14,078 --> 01:31:17,980
If you lose the moment,
you might lose a lot

1736
01:31:18,048 --> 01:31:20,312
So why not?

1737
01:31:20,384 --> 01:31:22,716
Why not?

1738
01:31:27,157 --> 01:31:30,786
Hmmmmmm, mmmm, mmmm

1739
01:31:32,129 --> 01:31:36,862
Ohhhhh, yeah

1740
01:31:36,934 --> 01:31:39,027
You've been searching
the world

1741
01:31:39,103 --> 01:31:41,196
To find true love

1742
01:31:41,271 --> 01:31:45,207
Looking in all
the wrong places

1743
01:31:45,275 --> 01:31:49,211
When all of the time,
you've been blind to love

1744
01:31:49,279 --> 01:31:53,045
It's plain as the nose
on your face is

1745
01:31:53,117 --> 01:31:57,383
It's here, it's now

1746
01:31:57,454 --> 01:32:00,890
Open your eyes and see it

1747
01:32:00,958 --> 01:32:05,395
Right here, right now

1748
01:32:05,462 --> 01:32:11,128
Open your eyes to love

1749
01:32:11,201 --> 01:32:15,194
You've been down on yourself,
thinking something's wrong

1750
01:32:15,272 --> 01:32:18,901
Wondering why love
has never found you

1751
01:32:18,976 --> 01:32:23,072
Don't you know it's been
right here all along

1752
01:32:23,147 --> 01:32:26,981
If only you'd look
around you?

1753
01:32:27,051 --> 01:32:29,076
It's here

1754
01:32:29,153 --> 01:32:31,417
It's now

1755
01:32:31,488 --> 01:32:34,924
Open your eyes and see it

1756
01:32:34,992 --> 01:32:37,119
Right here

1757
01:32:37,194 --> 01:32:38,218
Right now

1758
01:32:38,295 --> 01:32:39,592
Right now

1759
01:32:39,663 --> 01:32:44,760
Open your eyes to love

1760
01:32:44,835 --> 01:32:48,430
Love has been
right by your side

1761
01:32:48,505 --> 01:32:52,942
Oh, so close
that you couldn't see

1762
01:32:53,010 --> 01:32:57,106
If love could speak,
it would shout to the sky

1763
01:32:57,181 --> 01:32:59,274
"I've always been here

1764
01:32:59,349 --> 01:33:03,115
I always will be"

1765
01:33:03,187 --> 01:33:05,382
I'm here

1766
01:33:05,456 --> 01:33:06,718
I'm now

1767
01:33:06,857 --> 01:33:07,789
I'm now

1768
01:33:07,858 --> 01:33:11,453
Open your eyes and see me

1769
01:33:11,528 --> 01:33:12,586
Right here

1770
01:33:12,663 --> 01:33:13,652
Right here

1771
01:33:13,730 --> 01:33:14,924
Right now

1772
01:33:14,998 --> 01:33:16,124
Right now

1773
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:21,035
Open your eyes to love

1774
01:33:22,206 --> 01:33:26,575
Open your mind to love

1775
01:33:28,378 --> 01:33:35,477
Open your heart to love

1776
01:33:35,552 --> 01:33:41,957
Ooh, ooh, ooh
