1
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:18,006
- I won.
- What do you mean? You did not!

2
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,924
I did too.
The old man can still beat him.

3
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,673
Come on, Dad.
You saw it, didn't ya? I won.

4
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,845
Close, really close.

5
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:28,096
- All right. If it was close, let's go again.
- How many times do I have to beat you?

6
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,939
- You beat me?
- Yeah, I beat you.

7
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:34,402
- All right! You won!
- Hey, leave your father alone.

8
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,270
All this exercise is makin' me hungry.

9
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,948
- Come on, Dad. All right, you won.
- No, no.

10
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,693
- You won.
- No, you won.

11
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,990
- No, no, you won.
- No, you won.

12
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:48,116
Mr Childress, telephone for you, sir.
On the terrace.

13
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:14,392
Better get here as soon as you can.
I'll tell Peter.

14
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,937
What'll living in the States be like, Dad?

15
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:21,031
I don't know.
We've been away a long time.

16
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,368
- Yeah, it's been since Mum died.
- Yeah.

17
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:28,660
- Hey, why Chicago?
- Good school for you. The best.

18
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,869
- You could go out for football.
- What, give up soccer?

19
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:36,793
Well, football's more popular
in the States.

20
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,759
Football players
are more popular with the girls.

21
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,381
Dad...

22
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:48,805
I don't know, school and sports,
all that stuff...

23
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,680
I just won't fit in there.
I feel like some kind of a freak.

24
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,102
What is this?

25
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,724
Maybe if I knew
what was wrong with me...

26
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,444
There's nothing wrong with you.

27
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,233
I might do OK in a zoo.

28
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,778
What the hell are you doing?
Feeling sorry for yourself?

29
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,325
OK, you have a talent
that would shock the hell out of people.

30
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:11,040
But it's a talent
that also can be put to good use.

31
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,909
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

32
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,330
Childress understands this.

33
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,251
That's why he wants you
to go to this school in Chicago.

34
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:21,341
You'll meet other kids
that are... special, like you.

35
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,713
Robin...

36
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:28,716
I'll be with you.
All the way.

37
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:32,436
If it doesn't work out,
we'll do something else.

38
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,643
Robin... do me a favour.

39
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,816
I wanna talk to your father alone.
One minute.

40
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,030
- Sure. I'll be on the terrace, Dad.
- OK.

41
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,738
Peter...

42
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,828
You've gotta give me
the telephone number

43
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,372
of that dame
from the antique shop.

44
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:01,708
There's nothing antique about her.
Everything works.

45
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:06,045
- Gonna miss you.
- Well, I'm not gonna miss you!

46
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:09,424
20 years together in the same agency
is more than enough.

47
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,891
Well, you taught me a lot.
You did.

48
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,432
If this is gonna be a teary farewell,
get your ass outta here.

49
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,646
No tears. All laughs.

50
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,531
Say goodbye to your son alone.

51
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,583
Uh, waiter!

52
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,253
Regular luncheon for two.

53
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,273
My dad!

54
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,530
Get Robin outta here!

55
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,570
- Dad!
- He's all right. He's a professional.

56
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,036
- They're after my dad!
- They're after all of us.

57
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,526
For Christ's sakes...

58
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,493
Dad!

59
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,032
They killed my dad!

60
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,206
Oh, son, I'm sorry.

61
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,299
They killed my dad!

62
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,380
Robertson,
where the hell are you?

63
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:57,008
Gimme the gun!
I'll find out who broke that security.

64
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,134
- I'll check...
- No! Get this boy outta here.

65
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,807
Come on, Robin, move.
Let's go. Into the car.

66
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,648
It'll be all right, Robin.
It'll be all right.

67
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,157
I'm sorry, sir.

68
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,200
It's all right, Jonathan.
You did a very good job.

69
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,075
- I'm proud of you. Go by the road.
- Thank you. Sure.

70
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,710
Give me the film.

71
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,128
'It's already 87 degrees
this morning...'

72
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,463
I said, "Mother,
what do you want from me?

73
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:14,301
"You got this terrific job.
You're all over the world."

74
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,511
I get to see her once a month,
if I'm lucky.

75
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,052
"OK, I'm happy for you.
I really am.“

76
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:23,268
But I said,
"Just don't try and run my life

77
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,683
"when you happen to be
around the house for a few days

78
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,351
"and feel like playing Mum."

79
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,566
Mm-hm. I know.

80
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,152
They just don't know how to let go.

81
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,647
And they get so hurt
when you try to explain.

82
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,945
Really!

83
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,535
Anyway,
let's see if you know this junk.

84
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,575
January 10th, 1946.

85
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:47,626
That was the first
United Nations General Assembly

86
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,041
that was held in London.
Right?

87
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,460
- Good.
- See, I told you. I never forget dates.

88
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,707
All right...

89
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,676
Who was elected president
of the assembly?

90
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,887
It's names I have trouble with.

91
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,847
Uh...

92
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,313
- LaRue, don't tell me!
- I didn't say anything.

93
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,273
Yes, you did. You said "Raymond".
I heard you.

94
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,438
I did not. "Raymond"?

95
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,608
His name wasn't Raymond.
It was, uh...

96
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,196
Raymond Dunwoodie.

97
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,368
Who was Raymond Dunwoodie?

98
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,203
I don't know. It's just...

99
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,698
That name just came into my head.
I don't know.

100
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:29,577
- So what was the real answer?
- Paul-Henri Spaak of Belgium.

101
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,749
Oh, yes! Paul-Henri Spaak.

102
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,464
- I always get that wrong.
- OK, next.

103
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:38,677
The five permanent members
of the UN Security Council are...

104
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,467
The United States, Russia...

105
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,266
I know!

106
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,596
Let's just forget the whole thing.

107
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,850
- Forget it? Are you crazy?
- LaRue, I know this stuff.

108
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,399
- We have a final at two o'clock.
- And I'm gonna pass with flying colours.

109
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,693
I promise you.

110
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,943
Hey, guess what.
We got a buddy.

111
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,866
Oh, my God. What a creep.

112
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,114
He's walking backwards now.

113
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,914
- Should we give him money?
- No! God, what do you take me for?

114
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:14,128
I don't know.
Oh, he's not gonna bother us.

115
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,547
- I hope we pass.
- Sure! Two popcorns, please.

116
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,764
- 'Hello?'
- Mr Johnson?

117
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:27,851
- 'Yes.'
- It's Raymond Dunwoodie.

118
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:32,268
- 'What is it, Raymond?'
- Now, look, I haven't changed my mind.

119
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,732
There's nothing
I can do for you personally,

120
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:38,820
but I may have somebody
to locate your son.

121
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,360
'You'd better not be wasting my time.'

122
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:44,826
No, look, I'm at the beach,
and I made a contact.

123
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:48,993
She's a kid, maybe 17,
and she's psychic.

124
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,833
- 'Are you sure?'
- That's right, she's psychic.

125
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,622
'Bring her here.'

126
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,502
I don't have her yet,
but I could get her. Now, look...

127
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,217
Mr Johnson, this is gonna cost.

128
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,838
'How much?'

129
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:08,558
I don't mean 50 or 100 bucks,
not for this girl.

130
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:12,054
- 'How much, Raymond?'
- $1,000.

131
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,814
'I don't have that kind of money.'

132
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,810
'That's a sad story, Mr J.

133
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:21,814
'Almost as sad as the story
you told me about your boy.'

134
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,658
Dunwoodie paid off.
We've completed the trace.

135
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,278
He's talking to Sandza
at the Plymouth Hotel.

136
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,004
- Step inside, off the street.
- Yes, sir.

137
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,219
- Is this man registered here?
- I don't know.

138
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:53,221
- I just came on a half-hour ago myself.
- We think he's been here a few days.

139
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,393
You ain't the police, is ya?

140
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:00,857
Well... I'm what you'd consider
well-travelled,

141
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,821
but I've never heard
of you gentlemen.

142
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:06,487
We don't spend a dime
on public relations.

143
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,326
Yeah, well...

144
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,196
That would be Mr R.V. Johnson.
Room 512.

145
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,448
Just down the hall to your left.

146
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,950
Hey, government man!

147
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:19,125
Don't bust my door down, please.
Use a passkey.

148
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:01,463
Chase One to Chase Two.
He's loose. Do you copy?

149
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,885
He's loose. Do you copy?

150
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:14,100
Chase One to Chase Two.
He's loose. Do you copy?

151
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,276
'Gunmen
of the Hanafi Muslim sect

152
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,987
'continue their siege
of three Washington buildings.'

153
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,409
Goddammit!
Did you hear that, Vivian? Huh?

154
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,369
Now that's what I'm talkin' about.

155
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:37,036
Them bozos in Washington
are muggin' the whole damn country!

156
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,330
Every court in the land
helpin' 'em make it legal.

157
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:42,500
If you asked me what happened
to the milk of human kindness,

158
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,248
I'd have to tell you frankly

159
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,843
that the whole world
has dried up at the tit.

160
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,964
You can say that again.
I swear to hell I don't know...

161
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,139
- Vivian!
- Yes, Mother Nuckells, I'm coming.

162
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,763
Couldn't you just once
manage to go potty by yourself?

163
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,733
- Vivian, somebody's in my room!
- Oh, sure!

164
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:07,195
All right, now.
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

165
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:12,030
- I just want some clothes.
- He came in my window.

166
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,118
Do you know who he is?

167
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,409
I told you we should have
moved to Melrose Park.

168
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,875
This wouldn't be happening
if we lived in Melrose Park.

169
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,494
You... want clothes?

170
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,793
Old clothes, anything you've got.

171
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,793
Well, you can see I need clothes.
I can't go anywhere like this.

172
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,387
- Just the clothes?
- Yes.

173
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,471
Oh, I had to leave the hotel
in a hurry, so...

174
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,469
could you spare
a couple of dollars?

175
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,562
I knew it.

176
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,564
This is a graphic example
of biofeedback.

177
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,773
We're converting the very low-voltage
alpha-wave energy

178
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,445
into electricity to run that train.

179
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:57,913
And that train will only run
when my friend Hester is in alpha.

180
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,040
Now, as you may have hoped,

181
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:09,758
there are more practical applications
to biofeedback training.

182
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,173
If you can regulate your brain waves,

183
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:16,390
you can control your heart rate,
blood pressure, headaches, backaches,

184
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,100
even, ladies, cold feet.

185
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,060
I work at the Paragon Institute,

186
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:24,648
where we study the phenomena
of extrasensory perception.

187
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:28,185
And we are using
biofeedback techniques

188
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,734
to tap the almost limitless resources
of the human mind.

189
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:36,743
And I am speaking now of such things
as thought transmissions,

190
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:39,659
commonly known as telepathy.

191
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,248
Now, that machine
is called a magnetometer,

192
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,788
and it records the fluctuations

193
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:49,882
of the human electromagnetic field
during our experiments,

194
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,091
and I guess Hester's had it.

195
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,878
Thank you, Hester.

196
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,882
I wanna stress that no particular talent
is needed to achieve this.

197
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,727
Anybody can achieve alpha...
with a little patience.

198
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,640
Wanna try?

199
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,564
Sure.

200
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:18,034
Try to remember that “alpha"
is another word for "passive".

201
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:19,736
Right.

202
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:24,617
Visualise sitting in an empty theatre
in front of a blank screen.

203
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,540
And let that screen fill your mind.

204
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,538
- OK?
- OK.

205
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,010
- What is she doing?
- I have no idea.

206
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:26,136
Don't mind about them.
It's OK. Are you all right?

207
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,637
Creep!

208
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:32,605
I'd say I'm pretty sound,
considering the ravages of time.

209
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,728
For instance,
I don't have the use

210
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:38,653
of any more than one
of my limbs or vital organs.

211
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:43,950
Good thing the Lord God Jehovah
built in so many spare parts.

212
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,789
But when the old ticker gives out,
that's it.

213
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,328
Ain't that the truth?

214
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:53,046
- How long do you think you'll be staying?
- Oh, shut up, Vivian.

215
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:56,963
- Let the boy enjoy his breakfast.
- Thank you.

216
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:01,258
- What is it they want you for?
- I'm a high-level security risk.

217
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,882
Ooh!

218
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,190
Did you get it yet?

219
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,944
- No.
- It's been over two months!

220
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,360
Would you shut up, Betsy?

221
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,906
It does not! I mean...

222
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:27,156
- Gillian, I was saving that seat for Cheryl.
- Too bad.

223
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,249
- Cheryl can sit over here.
- Oh, God.

224
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:35,421
Cheryl, I'm sorry. I tried to save a seat
for you, but Gillian just took it.

225
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,836
- Look, have my seat...
- Hey, watch it!

226
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:42,678
Good Lord, Pam! If you're that nervous,
why don't you masturbate?

227
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,135
Are you ready for tomorrow?

228
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,650
You two are so sweet!

229
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,114
When are you getting married?

230
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,912
See any ghosts today, Gillian?

231
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,757
- Cheryl, you're not very funny.
- Gillian's not very funny.

232
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:25,172
There are more mature ways
to get attention, don't you think, Gillian?

233
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,183
Have you seen
Mr Wadkins' new girlfriend?

234
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,099
Yeah, where'd he pick that ticket?

235
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,517
Read my mind.

236
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,193
- What?
- Tell me what I'm thinking.

237
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,147
Come on, right now.
Read my mind.

238
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:44,069
That's what they say you can do.

239
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,410
No, I don't know how to read minds,
Cheryl. It's ridiculous.

240
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,996
- Cheryl, just...
- Shut up, LaRue!

241
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,662
I only wanna find something out.
That's all.

242
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,377
All right, come on.

243
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:01,341
Oh, great! Now pay attention, everybody.
Gillian's gonna perform.

244
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,676
I didn't say I'd...

245
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,671
Cheryl, I don't know anything
about reading minds, all right?

246
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:12,052
I mean, I don't even know
what I'm thinkin' most of the time, so...

247
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,145
get off my back.

248
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:20,602
- Gillian, you're so full of shit.
- Cheryl, you're an asshole. Just shut up.

249
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:25,781
She can't help being upset.
She has to take it out on someone.

250
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:31,821
What did you say?

251
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,368
You don't want everyone
to know that you're pregnant?

252
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:39,462
What? I would like for you
to explain that little remark.

253
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,672
Just what do you think
you know about me?

254
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,166
I'm sorry, I didn't...

255
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,589
- Tell me!
- Let go, Cheryl. Let go.

256
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,428
- Tell me!
- Please let go.

257
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,722
- Cheryl!
- Tell me!

258
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,340
No! Oh, my God!

259
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,683
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

260
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,307
Help me!

261
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,502
I put some cookies in a bag for you.

262
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:23,965
- You might get hungry later on.
- Thank you.

263
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,380
How's your hair? Dry yet?

264
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,461
Oh, it's fine.

265
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,259
- Hey!
- Oh, just fine.

266
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:34,009
That Shinola will wash right out.

267
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:38,138
I'd appreciate it if you'd wait
till after M*A*S*H to let them go.

268
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:41,983
<i>M*A*S*H?</i>
I'll <i>wait till Sunrise Semester.</i>

269
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,771
Might as well just leave 'em there.

270
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,990
They ain't got anything to say
I wanna hear.

271
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,360
I've heard it all before.

272
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:55,997
Peter?
Uh, that's your real name?

273
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,832
That's right.

274
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,703
Can't see a reason
why you'd make up lies to tell me.

275
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:05,457
- I don't matter, anyhow.
- I wouldn't lie to you, Mother Nuckells.

276
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:07,675
You know that.

277
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,553
Then I hope you find your son.

278
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:15,342
If he's alive... I'll find him.

279
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,183
And if the Feds get in your way,
shoot 'em.

280
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,852
Just shoot 'em.
It's all they deserve.

281
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:25,727
There's so many of them.
They just keep coming.

282
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,695
Kill 'em! Kill 'em!

283
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,690
Now, don't overwork yourself,
Mother Nuckells.

284
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,067
It's bad for the old ticker.

285
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,205
Thank you.

286
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:43,336
Would you let us outta here now?

287
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,421
No?

288
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,918
- Please!
- Get us outta here, do you hear?

289
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,539
Let's go check that out.

290
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:23,456
- That's all the way down.
- OK, man, I dig.

291
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:25,874
Hey, man. Check out Pops.

292
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,498
Let's see
what the old man got in the bag.

293
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:45,481
Watch One to Top Guy One.
Visual and clear. Do you copy?

294
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,067
- OK, let's have the bag.
- He's got a gun!

295
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:25,305
Come on, I wanna go home.

296
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,102
- Home with you?
- With me, yeah.

297
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:30,022
I'll never go home with you.
Come on.

298
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:35,440
- I don't wanna go home!
- You're gonna go home right now.

299
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,326
Hey, how's that for a horn, huh?

300
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,416
But listen to that stereo.

301
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,253
You ever heard better fuckin'
stereo sound in your life?

302
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,086
How can you be sure
it's Sandza?

303
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,299
He had to be
in the neighbourhood.

304
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:56,385
All we had to do was wait.

305
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,129
I trained with him.
I know his style.

306
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,339
What's he doing now? Over.

307
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:03,343
'Looks like off-duty cops
in that Cadillac ahead of us.'

308
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,057
There's nothing he can do now.

309
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,775
- Can I help you, Pop?
- You're under arrest.

310
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,109
What?

311
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:16,564
You're under arrest
for impersonating police officers.

312
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,816
Hey, hey, look out!
What the hell...?

313
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,694
He's got a piece.
It's in my armpit.

314
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,372
All right...
what do you want me to do?

315
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,788
Drive down that alley. Fast.

316
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,933
Crazy son of a bitch!

317
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:51,774
Take a right!
Head for Long River Drive.

318
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,313
Faster!

319
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,569
Holy shit!

320
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:12,245
- Should I drive a little faster?
- No. Slower.

321
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,542
Slower?

322
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:17,212
Right now you're the only two people
in the world I feel safe with.

323
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,880
I wanna enjoy your company.

324
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,470
Yeah, OK, sure, sure.

325
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:24,590
Why not?
We'll just cruise around a little bit.

326
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,592
Maybe after a while
you'll wanna talk.

327
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,765
Yeah.

328
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,147
What's your name?

329
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,984
- Peter.
- I'm Marty O'Brien.

330
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:38,195
Is that gun too uncomfortable
in your armpit?

331
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,816
No, no. I want you to meet my partner,
Officer Eggleston.

332
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:45,035
Uh... hi, Peter.
Why don't you call me Bob?

333
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,948
Hi, Bob. Nice car.

334
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,459
Yeah, it's brand-new.

335
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,875
I just picked it up
about a half-hour ago.

336
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:59,050
- I wouldn't want anything to happen to it.
- I don't blame you.

337
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,629
Uh...

338
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:07,634
- Is that shoe polish in your hair, Peter?
- Yes, it is. It's a disguise.

339
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:10,849
- That's a pretty clever disguise.
- Yeah.

340
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:13,723
It didn't work, though.
They were waiting for me.

341
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,271
Must have been waiting all day.

342
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,817
I gotta give that Childress a lot of credit,
the son of a bitch.

343
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,565
Somebody's after you, is that it?

344
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,535
What do you suppose
he's telling those cops?

345
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:40,375
Whatever it is,
they won't believe him.

346
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,502
I worked for a government agency
you never heard of.

347
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:47,973
They took my son away from me.

348
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,845
They needed him,
so they just took him.

349
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,520
Keep your hand in your lap, Marty.

350
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,609
It's a frightening power
these people have.

351
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,604
They can make anybody disappear
any time.

352
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,072
- Somebody's gotta stop 'em.
- Yeah, that's right.

353
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:06,784
If you don't mind me making a suggestion,
maybe we can help.

354
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:10,280
Yeah. You see, Marty and myself
have had a lot of experience with...

355
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,328
- People like kickin' people around.
- Harassin' them.

356
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,293
I got an idea.
Why don't we stop for some coffee?

357
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:20,005
Don't stop! Let's get the hell off this drive!
We're like sitting ducks here!

358
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:23,125
Easy, man. We're on your side.
We're just tryin' to help.

359
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,925
Chase One to Top Guy One.
We've got him on the Lower Drive. Copy?

360
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,052
Chase One, copy.
We're right above you.

361
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:35,184
Two sedans have been following us,
standard government issue.

362
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,431
- He's right about that...
- Bob!

363
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:41,151
- I want you to lose those cars.
- Lose? How do you suppose l...?

364
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,772
There's a construction site
over the bridge.

365
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:47,616
When we get there, I want you to follow
my instructions exactly, understand?

366
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,866
Bob...

367
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:56,789
If they can make me disappear,
they can make you disappear too.

368
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,627
Chase cars...

369
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:06,085
Pull up alongside the Cadillac.

370
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,087
Let's find out
what Peter has in mind.

371
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,483
Somethings goin' on here.
Do they look like Feds to you?

372
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,067
Who knows?

373
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:26,860
Peter, I'm worried about that gun goin' off
by accident if we hit a bump.

374
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,608
Got something to worry about.

375
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,826
Across the bridge
when the light changes?

376
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,321
We're not gonna wait
for the lights to change, Bob.

377
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,162
- We're not?
- Go!

378
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:58,687
Oh, God, please, God,
don't let anything happen to my new car.

379
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,273
Chase One to Top Guy One.
He's crossing bridge into fog.

380
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,812
Losing visual contact.

381
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:16,288
They're finished. Let's go home.
That son of a bitch!

382
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:33,131
- Hey, watch where you're goin'.
- I can't see anything in this soup.

383
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,346
- Which way?
- I don't know.

384
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,136
- You go straight and I'll go left.
- All right.

385
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:09,625
- Now what?
- Dunno.

386
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,887
Hear anything?

387
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,724
I don't know. Do you?

388
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,811
Yeah, I definitely hear something.

389
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:29,236
Chase One,
we're in pursuit of the Caddy!

390
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,959
I see him.

391
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,754
I see him.
He's over there, around to the right.

392
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:10,194
- Jesus!
- How the hell was l...?

393
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:18,369
There they are.
Go on, get movin'!

394
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,898
All right, get out.
Both of you!

395
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,397
Leave the motor running.

396
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:58,276
- I can't believe it. Not a scratch!
- Throw your pieces in the lake.

397
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,246
What are you gonna do now, Peter?

398
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:20,590
If you see Childress,
ask him if it was worth his arm.

399
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,181
What happened to his arm, Peter?

400
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,178
I killed it with a machine gun.

401
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:30,770
- Hey, Peter, now wait...
- Tell Childress to follow me!

402
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:35,104
I want him to follow me this time!

403
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,901
Not in my car, man.

404
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:40,780
- Watch out, Bob!
- Peter, let's talk about this!

405
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:26,451
Gillian, I know you're upset,
but it's silly.

406
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,291
I was told Cheryl has a history
of nosebleeds.

407
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,911
An ice bag stopped the bleeding.

408
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:35,085
But what I'm trying to tell you is:
I made it happen.

409
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:39,130
- Oh, that's impossible.
- What about when you started bleeding?

410
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,798
Remember,
a couple of weeks ago?

411
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,797
You said the cut was healed,
and it opened right up. Don't!

412
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,807
Why not?

413
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:51,555
Cos it could happen to you.

414
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,309
Gillian, I've had a long flight,
and I'm very tired.

415
00:35:56,237 --> 00:36:00,151
- I want you to stop carrying on like this.
- Don't be mad at me.

416
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,365
Sweetheart, I'm not.

417
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:07,913
I always thought we could
tell each other anything, no matter what.

418
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,702
We can.

419
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,950
Mother, I love you.

420
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,294
I'm afraid!

421
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,210
- Afraid to let me touch you?
- Yes.

422
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:24,505
Honey, I'm home and I'll stay here
just as long as you need me, I promise.

423
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:28,930
But what we really should do now
is talk to someone.

424
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:31,554
And Steve Brenneman
has had wonderful success...

425
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,931
I'm not going to a psychiatrist!

426
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,665
Hello?

427
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,418
Oh, it's you.

428
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,966
Oh, that was a good one.
Really passionate!

429
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,719
1".l need"J

430
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:16,185
Listen, I'm a nurse,

431
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:19,560
and if my phone's tied up
and they can't get hold of me...

432
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,192
So, maybe you could breathe
for someone else tonight.

433
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,446
L".l need".

434
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:30,867
I need... I need your body, baby!

435
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:34,826
'Come on, baby, it's me!'

436
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,044
Oh, my God!

437
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,803
Why do we always
have to meet in this van?

438
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,797
Couldn't we go to my place,
just this once?

439
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,220
Too dangerous.

440
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,639
Well, for the sake of argument,

441
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:58,983
let's assume that everybody
at the institute has their phones tapped.

442
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,522
Nobody's watching me,
for heaven's sakes.

443
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,645
They're always watching.

444
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,443
Raymond Dunwoodie was a psychic.

445
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:08,033
If he'd had enough time,
he'd have found Robin.

446
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:12,826
But Childress was watching him.
How else do you think they got to me?

447
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,743
Why are you so afraid of this guy?

448
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,709
I'm not afraid of Childress.
He's afraid of me.

449
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,124
He knows I'll get my son back.

450
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,668
Now what about those files?

451
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,667
Aw, I'm nobody.
I just work there.

452
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:28,512
I don't have access
to any vital secrets.

453
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,758
You mean, you didn't get a chance
to examine the files at Paragon?

454
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,518
- Yes, I did.
- And?

455
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,765
Robin is...

456
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,228
- Well, he's...
- Dead.

457
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,817
- According to the records...
- Of course that's what they say!

458
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:53,571
- Childress keeps the records!
- What if it's true?

459
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:57,199
Hester, look at me.
I'm proof.

460
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:02,375
Proof that my son is alive, else why would
Childress be so anxious to put me away?

461
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,006
They've got him somewhere.

462
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,888
You're the only one
who can help me.

463
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,938
How long did you follow me around

464
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,690
before taking a chance on me?

465
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,572
Too long.

466
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,576
Thanks.

467
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,542
Thanks for pickin' me.

468
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:33,796
Oh, Hester, you don't realise
how beautiful you really are.

469
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:52,736
Somewhere they're doin'
a hell of a lot of research.

470
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:57,699
Much more complicated
than Paragon.

471
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,417
God only knows
what they're doing to my son.

472
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:11,133
Peter, if Robin is still...

473
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,341
I promise I'll do everything I can
to help find Robin.

474
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:20,058
But you take too much for granted.
You trust too many people.

475
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,851
Paragon Institute!

476
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,321
It sounds like a haven for quacks.

477
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:36,692
- But their references are good.
- It's right up there on the left.

478
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,200
Gil, the more I think about it,

479
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,541
the more I'm convinced this is not
an appropriate course of action.

480
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:47,206
Mother, I like Dr Lindstrom.

481
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,375
Anyway, I'm old enough
to know what I'm doing.

482
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:59,639
Well, I don't intend to let you stay here
until they've answered a lot of questions,

483
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,179
- and I mean that, Gillian.
- OK.

484
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:05,012
- Hi, Gillian.
- Hi.

485
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:07,480
- Mrs Bellaver, I'm Ellen Lindstrom.
- How do you do?

486
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,894
- Please come in.
- Thank you.

487
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:13,896
Dr McKeever is busy monitoring a test,
but he should be with us shortly.

488
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:17,529
- Maybe you'd like to look around.
- Thank you.

489
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:25,286
I've been here before.

490
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:27,250
This was Babe Gifford's house.

491
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,619
Yes, we bought the house
from the Giffords.

492
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:31,212
It was so beautifully furnished,

493
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,253
we tried to make
as few alterations as possible.

494
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,377
As a matter of fact,
Gillian's suite is particularly attractive.

495
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,754
I don't understand
why you want Gillian to stay...

496
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:42,007
That was my idea, Mrs Bellaver.

497
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:45,807
Gillian and Katherine Bellaver,
this is our director, Jim McKeever.

498
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,020
How do you do?

499
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:50,265
- Gillian.
- Hi.

500
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,855
Young people
stay with us all the time

501
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,399
while they help
with our evaluation programme.

502
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,113
Thanks, Ellie.

503
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,573
We can do a better job
of judging psychic ability

504
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,909
if there's a minimum of distractions.

505
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:04,700
Of course,
it's not all work and no play.

506
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:08,791
There's a good library right here
and a game room down the hall.

507
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,786
- Do you play backgammon, Gillian?
- Yeah.

508
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:11,912
Good.

509
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:17,384
And our housekeeper is the best
Irish cook in Chicago, I'm sorry to say.

510
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:20,675
I'd like to know what kind of programme
you're talking about, Doctor.

511
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:23,845
Certainly. Why don't we look
at one of our workshops?

512
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:32,266
Telepathy is a timeless
form of communication.

513
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:36,277
Now my five-year-old daughter
was very good at this.

514
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,646
But the older and more sophisticated
we become,

515
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:42,276
the more we rationalise
what our senses try to tell us.

516
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,785
This is all Gillian will be doing?

517
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:52,752
Yes, this and similar tests,
under my personal supervision.

518
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,121
We'll take good care of her,
Mrs Bellaver.

519
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:58,922
I'll be fine. Don't worry.
I'll see you in a couple of weeks, OK?

520
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:02,421
All right, but I'll call you
the minute I get to Paris.

521
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:05,845
- You know where I'm staying if you...
- Yes, Mother. I'll be fine.

522
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,433
Good bye.

523
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:10,846
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mrs Bellaver.

524
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,940
- Nice meeting you.
- Have a good trip.

525
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:23,074
Oh, my God! It's beautiful!

526
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,863
Do you like it?

527
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:27,078
Look at this!

528
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,492
Ah!

529
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,661
It's great!

530
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:35,454
I'll start unpacking. Look around,
make yourself comfortable.

531
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:37,501
This is beautiful!

532
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:41,251
- "Paragon." The best there is, right?
- Something that can't be equalled.

533
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:45,096
Like the incredible power
of the human mind.

534
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:48,057
We hope you learn to use that power
to develop your gift.

535
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,802
It's not a gift.

536
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:54,477
It's more like having a bad tooth
and never knowing when it's gonna hurt.

537
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:58,819
That's because a part of the mind you've
never used before becomes sensitised.

538
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:02,234
- Sensitised to what?
- The bioplasmic universe.

539
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,448
Come again?

540
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:06,659
The bioplasmic universe.

541
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:12,241
In that universe is a record of
every human impulse, word and deed.

542
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,956
Of lives past and lives to come.

543
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:21,716
Occasionally you make a connection

544
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:25,007
between the timeless world
and the physical world.

545
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:29,428
You have
what clairvoyants call "a vision".

546
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,599
But it's never about me, though.
I never see anything about me.

547
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,768
Guess I'm glad I don't.

548
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,743
I've been thinking.
We should have a little treat.

549
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:22,246
- Just for ourselves.
- What?

550
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:26,249
Hot fudge sundaes,
vanilla and chocolate ice cream...

551
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:29,594
- Hester...
- Bananas, maraschino cherries,

552
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:32,339
coconut, strawberry topping,

553
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:35,058
- whipped cream all over the top...
- No, stop.

554
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:37,052
Ta-da!

555
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:39,600
Oh, my God! You guys!

556
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,645
If I don't finish these tests soon,

557
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,270
I'll be so fat,
you'll have to roll me outta here!

558
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,487
- Well, have fun.
- Thanks.

559
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:51,358
Come on. You've earned it.

560
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:53,735
You're right. What the hell.

561
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:56,989
Besides, what are you talkin' about?
You look terrific.

562
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,115
- Not after this.
- Do you have a boyfriend?

563
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:04,872
No, no one special. What about you?
Pretty slim pickings around here.

564
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:09,422
- Yeah, Paragon is just a job.
- Well, do you have a boyfriend?

565
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:13,137
- Have I got a boyfriend!
- What's he like?

566
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:17,884
Well, he's very charming.
Swept me right off my feet.

567
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,512
- In the park.
- In the park?

568
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:22,855
Yeah, he picked me up in the park.

569
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:25,270
What was his line?

570
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,402
He said he needed help.

571
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:30,859
Some line!

572
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:35,155
- What are you talkin' about? It worked.
- True. What does he do?

573
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,743
Do?

574
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:39,534
Well, he... travels around a lot.

575
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,287
Where?

576
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,003
Well... all over.

577
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:50,925
Oh, when he comes to town,
we go to... parties.

578
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,215
He loves people.

579
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:57,341
He takes me out dancing,
buys me presents...

580
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:02,019
Oh, he dresses beautifully,
and he's a good dancer.

581
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:08,481
The only trouble is...
he's very hard to get hold of.

582
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:13,524
Oh, come on.
Let's dig in.

583
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,993
You mean gross out!
Look at this!

584
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:22,240
Mmh...

585
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:26,999
When I was your age,
I had one great ambition.

586
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:29,418
- What?
- To be Fred Astaire.

587
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,086
Oh, my God.

588
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,334
As you can see,
I failed miserably.

589
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:37,715
I took dance for a couple of years.
My mother insisted.

590
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:40,933
You see, she didn't think
I was any too graceful...

591
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:26,020
Agh!

592
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:31,476
Don't touch me anymore!

593
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:35,738
Please don't touch me!

594
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,903
Oh, God!

595
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:42,244
God! What happened?

596
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,684
Tomorrow we do real tests,

597
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:12,559
make things
as challenging as possible for Gillian.

598
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:17,276
Nelson, as soon as Gillian begins
to demonstrate her psychometric talents,

599
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:20,526
I want complete audio
and videotape records of the tests.

600
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:22,447
Will she be working
in the Faraday cage?

601
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,447
No, this girl's not a cheat.
She's the real thing.

602
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:28,870
Now...

603
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:32,920
Do we have any bleeders
in the group?

604
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,164
No.

605
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:40,046
Anyone who's had even minor surgery
in the past three months?

606
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,842
- How about ulcers?
- Uh-uh.

607
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:46,597
Hester, Kristen, Lorraine...

608
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:51,431
If you're into your monthlies,
I don't want you around during testing.

609
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:54,730
- Are you serious?
- I'm very serious.

610
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:57,570
Gillian's power to psychometrise
is spontaneous.

611
00:51:57,698 --> 00:52:01,111
She creates an enormously powerful
electromagnetic field.

612
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:03,951
Almost everyone exposed to it
will bleed.

613
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,447
Some will bleed a little, some a lot.

614
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,494
What is this kid?
A vampire?

615
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:12,452
You wanna continue working here?

616
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:15,421
Then I don't wanna hear
any more funny remarks like that.

617
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,881
- How do you account for it?
- We can't account for it.

618
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:20,217
Not yet.

619
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:34,106
Gillian... can you hear me?

620
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,771
It takes a few moments
for the Evipal to take effect.

621
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:38,895
Ellie, please.

622
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:44,484
Gillian... what did you see
on the stairs?

623
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:48,700
A boy.

624
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:51,199
Robin.

625
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:00,587
Have you seen him before?

626
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:06,840
Yeah.

627
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:09,592
I have.

628
00:53:13,399 --> 00:53:16,608
Gillian and Robin
were in touch telepathically.

629
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:19,067
Think what we would accomplish
if Robin were alive.

630
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,813
- I'm sending her home.
- Jim...

631
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:26,405
- Why?
- I don't wanna be responsible for Gillian.

632
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:30,155
- I don't think you mean that.
- I don't wanna talk about it anymore!

633
00:53:37,506 --> 00:53:39,497
It's late.

634
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,794
And we're both overexcited.

635
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,508
Listen, I don't understand something.

636
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:54,103
This is a marvellous opportunity for us.

637
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,306
We only had Robin for a few days,

638
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:59,935
but I think that Gillian
really wants to work with us,

639
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:04,735
and she is the best subject
for psychic research I have ever seen.

640
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,075
Ellie...

641
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:12,864
Even the most backward tribes,
the most primitive cultures on Earth,

642
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,742
would welcome
the birth of a Robin Sandza.

643
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:20,088
And in time he'd become their magician,
their prophet, their great healer.

644
00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:23,374
There is no place for these kids
in our culture.

645
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,548
They're superior
to what we hold sacred.

646
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:33,760
And what a culture can't assimilate...
it destroys.

647
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:36,263
Jim, what really happened
to Robin Sandza?

648
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:44,896
He was running on the steps,
takin' them... two or three at a time.

649
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:46,898
He...

650
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,652
...slipped and went through the window.

651
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,200
But why was he running?

652
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:56,032
I don't know, Ellie.
I wasn't here.

653
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,137
Jim...

654
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:16,390
Why don't you come up to my place?

655
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:20,974
- I mean, I'll scramble some eggs...
- No, I'm, uh...

656
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:24,605
I'm gonna finish this.

657
00:55:27,533 --> 00:55:32,824
Then I'm gonna stretch out
on the couch for a couple of hours.

658
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:38,449
Um... what time is it?
My watch has stopped.

659
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,912
It's a quarter after four.

660
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,874
Oh, excuse me.

661
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,216
It's later than I thought.

662
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:58,310
Thanks, Ellie.

663
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,148
Well...

664
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:12,859
Good night, Jim.

665
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:55,033
Good morning.

666
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,332
What do you want?

667
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:07,705
My arm hurts.

668
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,299
It's dead.

669
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,839
Why should it still hurt?

670
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,757
You're the brain expert.

671
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,556
So, tell me.

672
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:20,676
Is it all in my head, Doctor?

673
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:26,683
It's an oversimplification,
but there's nothing I can do.

674
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,934
That's not why I came here.

675
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:33,485
Tell me about Gillian Bellaver.

676
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:39,120
My people always know
what's going on here,

677
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:41,909
even if you're slow
to keep me informed.

678
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:45,956
Will the girl be
another Robin Sandza?

679
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:50,419
- No.
- Really?

680
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,876
Poor Peter.

681
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:58,506
If he only knew that Robin
doesn't care anymore,

682
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:01,225
doesn't care
if his father's alive or dead.

683
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:06,514
- What the hell have you done to that boy?
- He's being treated like a prince.

684
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,561
He is. He's royalty, unique.

685
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:12,403
The Chinese don't have one,
the Soviets don't have one.

686
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:16,490
In all the world,
there's no one quite like Robin Sandza...

687
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:18,325
unless it's this girl.

688
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:22,784
How can you hold him against his will
and get any kind of results?

689
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:25,078
Against his will?

690
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,918
You don't understand Robin's needs.

691
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,707
We do.

692
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,427
Are you testing the girl today?

693
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:41,049
She's failed every test.
She's a fake. I'm sending her home.

694
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:44,552
- I don't have time to waste on people...
- Don't do that to me, Doctor.

695
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,767
Don't ever try lying to me.

696
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:55,521
For God's sakes, she's just a child.
She doesn't know anything.

697
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:58,274
She has no control
over what she's doing.

698
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:02,452
Robin had no control
when he came here.

699
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:04,788
Just raw ability.

700
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:09,289
Doctor...
I wish you could see him now.

701
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,256
For God's sakes.

702
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:18,548
I want you to get yourself together,
stop fudging your responsibilities.

703
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,806
This girl is important to me.

704
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:28,016
I'm assigning extra security.

705
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:30,894
Why?

706
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:34,519
If I know Peter,
he penetrated your security weeks ago.

707
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:37,191
He probably knows
I have Gillian Bellaver.

708
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:41,025
I don't know who his confederate is,

709
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:44,449
but I'm looking into it.

710
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:08,518
Oh.

711
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:12,056
- She's all right.
- Try that one.

712
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:15,522
I will, I Will.

713
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:23,032
'Kristen, where's Dr McKeever?'

714
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:26,495
'He's checking out
the new testing equipment.'

715
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:29,866
- 'Do you know when he'll be back?'
- 'He said not before dinner.'

716
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:33,039
- 'Where's Gillian?'
- 'Having breakfast.'

717
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:35,788
'I could use a cup of coffee myself.'

718
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:48,179
A Club...

719
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:56,017
Good morning, Gillian.
You're not eating much.

720
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:58,190
I'm not very hungry.

721
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,948
Did you hear
what happened yesterday?

722
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:06,114
Dr McKeever's hand started bleeding.

723
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:09,697
Yes, I do know about that.

724
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:12,746
Well, what are you gonna do about it?

725
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:15,916
I mean, it's why I'm here, isn't it?

726
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:18,129
Can't anybody help me?

727
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:22,376
Gillian, we have to work together.

728
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,640
Gillian.

729
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,890
Do you remember much
of what we talked about last night?

730
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:36,682
Last night?

731
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:41,653
- Were you here last night, Dr Lindstrom?
- That's all right.

732
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:45,274
While you were with Dr McKeever,
you had a vision that upset you.

733
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,151
You were in a fugue state for a while.

734
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:50,616
We gave you something
to help you relax,

735
01:01:50,749 --> 01:01:54,583
and I suggested that you consciously
forget whatever was troubling you.

736
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:59,080
And apparently...
it worked better than I thought!

737
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:04,385
So you don't remember
anything about Robin Sandza?

738
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:08,676
No. Who's Robin Sandza?

739
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:13,932
He's a boy your age...
with powers like yours.

740
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:18,019
Like me?

741
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:22,315
Well, where is he?
I mean, do you think I could talk to him?

742
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:36,621
Do you know him?

743
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:40,704
I feel like I do.

744
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,423
What can you tell me about him?

745
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,267
He's...

746
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,850
He's not very clear. He's...

747
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:02,650
He's, like, dreaming or...

748
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:07,652
...or not... not awake yet.

749
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:14,614
Drugged.

750
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,286
Stop!

751
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:21,378
Just relax, Robin. Relax.
It's gonna be OK.

752
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:25,208
Gillian, where are you?

753
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,844
Get that light off him.

754
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:34,342
Disturbance of the magnetic field
on the last PK.

755
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:37,344
Trial was stochastical,
with a parametrical resonance

756
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,222
on a frequency of five cycles.

757
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:42,599
We'll go for a
magnetometer check now.

758
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:44,977
The infrared scanning system
is operational.

759
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:47,946
We want a two-dimensional
view of the field potentials.

760
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,907
We have a mild
electrostatic field fluctuation.

761
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:53,653
We have differentiation
between the P and T waves.

762
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:56,075
Heart action slightly arrhythmic.

763
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:58,665
Let me have
that electroneurogram reading.

764
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:01,911
Pulse 66. Pressure 114/92.

765
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:09,794
Pulse steady at 67.
Pressure 115/94.

766
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:12,136
Robin, we're going
to show you a film.

767
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:16,262
Now, there's nothing in there
that can possibly harm you,

768
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:19,887
but you must keep watching, OK?

769
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:23,731
Pulse beginning to rise. 73.

770
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,022
Pressure 115/94.

771
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:31,240
Magnetometer holding at 640.

772
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:34,076
Pulse is 78. Pressure 129/111.

773
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:37,617
No. Keep watching.
Keep watching.

774
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:40,787
We have a mild
electrostatic field fluctuation.

775
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:45,921
- Body temperature 89.59.
- Pulse steady at 65.

776
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:48,256
Robin, please keep watching.

777
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:53,554
No! No!

778
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:55,968
Robin, please, for God's sake,
watch the screen.

779
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:58,263
Gillian! Gillian!

780
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:00,760
Where is Robin now, Gillian?

781
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:12,026
My dad!
They're after my dad!

782
01:05:18,123 --> 01:05:19,534
Dad!

783
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,789
No!

784
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:31,508
Oh! Oh! Oh!

785
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:09,788
- Hester?
- Oh, thank God!

786
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:12,256
Oh, my God. Listen.

787
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:15,794
I need to talk to my mother.
Do you think I could call my mother?

788
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:17,762
You can talk to your mum
in a little while,

789
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:21,179
but you've had an awful shock,
and you need to rest.

790
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:23,018
- Here.
- What is that?

791
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:27,936
It's a sedative. It's like aspirin.
You take aspirin, don't you?

792
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:30,058
Here's some water.

793
01:06:31,863 --> 01:06:33,945
Drink plenty of water.

794
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:35,984
Oh, that's a good girl.

795
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:39,781
I need to see Dr McKeever.
I have to know what happened to Ellen.

796
01:06:39,913 --> 01:06:42,701
He'll be here in a little while.
I'll stay here with you.

797
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,789
Just lie down and relax.

798
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:48,001
No! No, I gotta get outta here.
I gotta go home.

799
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:49,665
It's all right, Gillian.

800
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:52,915
Everything'll be all right.
We'll take good care of you. Don't worry.

801
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:58,637
Ellen's x-rays were encouraging.

802
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:00,722
She's beginning to show
signs of consciousness.

803
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:09,231
- It had to be a cerebral haemorrhage...
- "She's a fake."

804
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,441
You were gonna send her home.

805
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:15,855
Is that the kind of cooperation
I can expect, Doctor?

806
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:22,949
I want Gillian Bellaver
at the PSI facility tomorrow.

807
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:26,290
Do we let her mother know?
She's wealthy, with powerful friends.

808
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:28,033
Gillian can't just dis...

809
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:58,456
Peter, it's impossible.

810
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:02,336
I'll never be able to get that girl
out of that place. I'll blow it.

811
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:06,386
Getting out of Paragon
is a hell of a lot easier than getting in.

812
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:10,473
- What do I say to Gillian?
- Tell her everything.

813
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:13,973
Tell her what they did to Robin.
They'll do the same thing to her.

814
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:16,520
- What if she won't listen?
- I don't have much time.

815
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:19,486
That girl can lead me to Robin.

816
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:24,199
- She was doped the last time I saw her.
- Everything's set for tomorrow.

817
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:26,489
Tomorrow?

818
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:30,072
I need your help. Please.

819
01:11:57,104 --> 01:11:59,061
You feel all right, Robin?

820
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:03,524
You know,
that wasn't a very smart thing to do.

821
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:05,894
You could have been
very badly hurt.

822
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:10,231
Why were you running away?

823
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:14,990
You didn't have to use the window.
There is a door.

824
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:19,081
Yeah, like they'd really
let me just walk out the door!

825
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:23,704
Why didn't you come to me?

826
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:26,380
Because you're one of them.

827
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,547
I just wanna get outta here.
I hate this place.

828
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:32,174
I hate these doctors and the tests.

829
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:35,014
They're driving me crazy.
I can't even sleep.

830
01:12:36,227 --> 01:12:39,686
And you want to get away
from me, too. Is that it?

831
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:46,147
- What do you care?
- Well, I care very much.

832
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:54,158
What's the matter, Robin?
Don't you trust me anymore?

833
01:12:58,082 --> 01:12:59,743
I don't know.

834
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:09,792
But you do want to get out of here,
don't you?

835
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:12,544
Yeah.

836
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:16,048
All right.
Then we'll go together.

837
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:18,509
- Go where?
- Gillian!

838
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:24,014
Well,
I have this place in the country,

839
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:26,642
north of Chicago, in Lakeview.

840
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:27,767
Gillian?

841
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:31,779
You can do whatever you like.
You don't have to see anybody.

842
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:34,491
You don't have talk to anybody.

843
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:36,826
Not even me.

844
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:41,322
Really?

845
01:13:43,002 --> 01:13:44,959
Yes, really.

846
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:48,292
Would you like to do that?

847
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:51,757
Sure.

848
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:54,214
Gillian?

849
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:58,965
Gillian?

850
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:00,675
Hi, Hester.

851
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:03,807
I've been lookin' everywhere for you.

852
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:07,352
This was Robin's room
when he was here.

853
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:12,529
Yes, it was.

854
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,191
He's in terrible trouble now.

855
01:14:16,327 --> 01:14:18,568
Those people,
they should be trying to help him.

856
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:21,572
What people?

857
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:24,116
Where Robin is.

858
01:14:24,919 --> 01:14:26,330
They won't leave him alone.

859
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:31,005
I mean, it was like they were
deliberately trying to hurt him.

860
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:35,760
- Hester, don't!
- Please, please, it's OK.

861
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:37,879
It's OK.

862
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:46,346
I'm not bleeding.

863
01:14:51,237 --> 01:14:54,525
- You know where Robin is?
- Yeah, I do.

864
01:14:55,866 --> 01:14:57,356
Would you like to see him?

865
01:14:59,704 --> 01:15:02,036
<i>I need</i> to see him.

866
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,662
Well, I think we can work that out.

867
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:09,494
How?

868
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:16,092
Dr McKeever says
I'm supposed to give these to you

869
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:18,837
to keep you happy and harmless.

870
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:21,764
- Do you know what I mean?
- No. What...?

871
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:23,974
You'll have to pretend
you took them,

872
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:26,970
because I have to
get you out of here tomorrow.

873
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:29,347
Otherwise
you could be in trouble yourself.

874
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:31,941
What are you saying?
What is going on?

875
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:35,061
Oh, honey,
I've got so much to tell you.

876
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:12,853
Would you like a drink?

877
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:15,272
You look tired.

878
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:17,611
<i>I am</i> tired.

879
01:16:19,784 --> 01:16:21,366
How's our Boy Wonder?

880
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:22,950
Those films
of his father's death

881
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:25,036
have unleashed
an incredible emotional force.

882
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:27,906
He's developing
the power of an atomic reactor.

883
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:30,204
Or an atomic bomb.

884
01:16:30,878 --> 01:16:32,664
What are you giving him
to calm him down?

885
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:35,289
Every day he has
3000mg of phenobarbital

886
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:37,756
and 1000mg of Prolixin.
On trial days...

887
01:16:37,885 --> 01:16:40,593
What the hell are you
telling me? That's enough to kill him!

888
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:43,008
Drugs no longer
have any effect on him.

889
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:46,428
We've pushed him too far.
He's quite unstable.

890
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:50,098
- He flies into rages over nothing.
- He could be dangerous.

891
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:55,103
What's he trying to prove?

892
01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:59,904
Mentally, Robin has developed
this perfect psychotronic relationship

893
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:01,898
with all kinds of machines.

894
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:06,198
And so naturally he's trying to do
the same thing now with his body.

895
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:09,823
Except that physically,
he's just... adequate.

896
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:13,042
And when he fails... he's intolerable.

897
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:16,496
How is he performing in bed?

898
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:23,261
Robin wants to please me.
That's the main thing, isn't it?

899
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:34,602
He needs a rest.
No more tests for at least a month.

900
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:36,974
Sorry.

901
01:17:37,111 --> 01:17:41,981
He's been under tremendous pressure.
We plan to get away, just the two of us.

902
01:17:42,116 --> 01:17:43,572
No.

903
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:45,783
We almost lost him once, Susan.

904
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:50,579
I promised. I promised him
we'd get away, together.

905
01:17:54,962 --> 01:17:56,748
All right.

906
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:00,248
Take him into the city.

907
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:04,503
Show him the sights,
but get him back here in 24 hours.

908
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:30,027
Well, there you are.

909
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:32,871
Who are they?

910
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:36,080
These are friends of mine
from the institute.

911
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:39,704
Are you planning
on seeing them later?

912
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:43,751
No, Robin. I'm with you.
Remember?

913
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:45,752
Which one
are you gonna screw first?

914
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:51,882
Robin, come here.

915
01:18:52,019 --> 01:18:54,260
- Get away from me!
- Robin, please.

916
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:49,648
Oh, my God!

917
01:21:56,495 --> 01:22:00,113
Top Guy Two, this is Top Guy One.
Do you have any coffee left?

918
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:03,578
Top Guy One,
that's an affirmative.

919
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:06,247
I've got about a cup
of lukewarm coffee left.

920
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:08,371
You wanna negotiate a trade?

921
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:12,671
Uh, Top Guy Two,
I have one Hershey bar to trade.

922
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:17,008
Top Guy One, I read you.
Is that with or without almonds?

923
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:21,226
All right, Asshole One and Asshole Two,
stop cluttering up this frequency.

924
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:26,727
Isn't Dr McKeever back yet?

925
01:22:26,859 --> 01:22:31,649
Oh, I'm afraid not, Hester.
He's still at the hospital with Ellen.

926
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:33,896
Can I help?

927
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:46,330
Dr McKeever prescribed medication
for Gillian this morning,

928
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:48,419
but we're all out of it.

929
01:22:49,423 --> 01:22:53,838
He was very specific
about using a nonbarbiturate.

930
01:22:59,516 --> 01:23:02,975
- So I guess I'd better go to the drugstore.
- Fine.

931
01:23:21,205 --> 01:23:22,695
Hey.

932
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:26,032
- Are these ready to be mailed yet?
- Yeah, why?

933
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:28,660
I could take 'em
to the Post Office for you.

934
01:23:28,795 --> 01:23:31,287
Oh, that would be terrific.

935
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:34,256
I'd really appreciate that, Hester.
Here, these go in.

936
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:37,001
These have to be stamped.
And that stuff.

937
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:44,053
Whoops.

938
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:52,313
Here comes the pony express!

939
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:54,731
Oh, hi.
Will you be gone long?

940
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:57,070
- Oh, no! I have to go...
- Shh.

941
01:23:58,742 --> 01:24:01,609
I have to whiz to the drugstore,
whiz to the post office...

942
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:04,703
I have so many things to do,
I'll never get through the day.

943
01:24:04,831 --> 01:24:08,040
Oh, I'm silly.
I can't go without the card.

944
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:11,577
Where is the card?

945
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:14,671
Where is that card?
I haven't the faintest idea.

946
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:18,672
- How's Gillian?
- She's doin' just fine.

947
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:21,382
That's good.

948
01:24:21,515 --> 01:24:25,509
Gillian... how about a bacon,
lettuce and tomato sandwich?

949
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:29,186
- OK.
- Good girl.

950
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:55,629
Damn!

951
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:58,624
- Oh, I'll give you a hand.
- Don't bother.

952
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,923
- It's no bother.
- I can take care of it. It's OK.

953
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:35,703
Oh, for God's sake,
move your ass!

954
01:25:40,761 --> 01:25:42,877
Oh, I'll get that, Gillian.

955
01:25:44,306 --> 01:25:46,513
Here's some more, Hester.

956
01:30:26,755 --> 01:30:29,042
I killed her.

957
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:33,668
I knew I would,
the first time I said hello...

958
01:30:35,639 --> 01:30:38,472
...and conned her into helping me.

959
01:30:41,353 --> 01:30:43,936
She would have done anything for me.

960
01:30:48,777 --> 01:30:51,314
Hey, you better get some sleep.

961
01:30:51,446 --> 01:30:54,734
Don't stop.
Please keep talking.

962
01:30:56,242 --> 01:30:59,109
I'm afraid to close my eyes.

963
01:30:59,245 --> 01:31:01,953
Afraid of what I'll see.

964
01:31:04,918 --> 01:31:07,159
- Sip this.
- No, I don't wanna.

965
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:09,787
Sip it. You'll feel better.

966
01:31:20,433 --> 01:31:22,800
That's the best thing in the world
for a toothache.

967
01:31:29,442 --> 01:31:31,809
Tell me about Robin.

968
01:31:35,782 --> 01:31:37,068
You tell me.

969
01:31:39,703 --> 01:31:44,288
It's just that... sometimes I know
what's happening to him,

970
01:31:46,209 --> 01:31:50,373
what he's thinking...
what he's feeling.

971
01:31:52,048 --> 01:31:57,543
I'm... like a receiver,
and Robin sends me pictures.

972
01:31:59,472 --> 01:32:01,679
Jesus, that's amazing.

973
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:05,722
You're like twins.

974
01:32:08,565 --> 01:32:10,727
He's a good-looking kid.

975
01:32:13,570 --> 01:32:15,607
You're the kind of girl
Robin would like.

976
01:32:19,826 --> 01:32:24,286
I raised him myself.
His mother died at childbirth.

977
01:32:25,749 --> 01:32:27,581
How come you didn't marry again?

978
01:32:28,585 --> 01:32:31,327
Well, there just hasn't been anybody.

979
01:32:32,297 --> 01:32:33,628
Hester?

980
01:32:39,471 --> 01:32:41,087
Yeah.

981
01:32:42,974 --> 01:32:44,009
Hester.

982
01:32:55,695 --> 01:32:57,857
Hey. Hey-

983
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:13,035
Hey, when was the last time
you saw Robin?

984
01:33:13,171 --> 01:33:15,458
Oh, about 11 months.

985
01:33:17,926 --> 01:33:20,384
He's been growing up so fast.

986
01:33:23,139 --> 01:33:27,098
You know, I'm a good athlete,
but he's better.

987
01:33:28,394 --> 01:33:32,353
The last day at the club,
we raced in the pool, about ten laps.

988
01:33:32,482 --> 01:33:36,817
He beat me, but I said I won.
He said "No, you didn't." I said “I did too."

989
01:33:36,945 --> 01:33:39,186
He jumped up
on the side of the pool and said,

990
01:33:39,322 --> 01:33:42,610
"All right, we'll do it again.
20 laps this time.“

991
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:46,576
I was so dead, I could hardly
drag myself out of the water.

992
01:33:46,704 --> 01:33:49,617
I said, "All right.
You won, you won."

993
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,962
Tell me, Gillian.

994
01:34:02,137 --> 01:34:03,673
How is he?

995
01:34:07,851 --> 01:34:09,341
He's OK.

996
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:15,514
OK.

997
01:34:17,735 --> 01:34:19,442
Yeah.

998
01:34:20,029 --> 01:34:22,396
We're all gonna be OK.

999
01:34:24,701 --> 01:34:26,942
That's a promise.

1000
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:45,465
Peter!

1001
01:34:45,597 --> 01:34:47,679
Stop! Please, let me off!

1002
01:34:47,807 --> 01:34:49,889
I'm supposed to get off here!

1003
01:34:54,355 --> 01:34:56,141
Peter!

1004
01:34:59,485 --> 01:35:02,068
- What the hell are you doing?
- You were gonna leave me!

1005
01:35:02,197 --> 01:35:05,656
Now, look. You got me here.
Now stay out of this.

1006
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:10,945
- He's my son. It's my fight.
- I don't know who to trust anymore!

1007
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:15,369
Look, that bus'll take you to Seattle.
I paid the driver. You'll be safe.

1008
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:17,583
You can't leave me!

1009
01:35:18,755 --> 01:35:21,292
Get on that bus and stay on it!

1010
01:35:24,093 --> 01:35:25,629
Peter!

1011
01:35:25,762 --> 01:35:28,049
But I can take you to him now.

1012
01:35:28,181 --> 01:35:32,015
Peter, I was lying before.
Robin's not OK. He needs us now!

1013
01:35:32,143 --> 01:35:34,976
It's too dangerous.
People around me get killed.

1014
01:35:35,104 --> 01:35:40,099
Dammit, people around me get hurt too!
I make them bleed!

1015
01:35:40,235 --> 01:35:43,353
Robin can help me. Please!

1016
01:36:18,064 --> 01:36:20,226
Oh, Jesus!

1017
01:36:22,277 --> 01:36:23,733
Why did you do that?

1018
01:36:23,861 --> 01:36:26,774
I don't like it
when you smell like this stuff.

1019
01:36:27,657 --> 01:36:30,274
Could you just leave me alone
for a little bit, Robin?

1020
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:34,324
I got tired of waiting for you.
What's taking so long?

1021
01:36:34,455 --> 01:36:36,537
I wanted to have a bath
and a little privacy.

1022
01:36:36,666 --> 01:36:38,907
But you're taking
too goddamn long!

1023
01:36:39,043 --> 01:36:42,001
Is everything all right, Dr Charles?

1024
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:44,292
Yes, everything's fine.

1025
01:36:45,258 --> 01:36:49,923
When the others arrive, would you just
hold them downstairs for a moment?

1026
01:36:50,054 --> 01:36:53,797
I need a few minutes in here, OK?
I'll call you. Thank you.

1027
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:47,536
Robin?

1028
01:38:48,631 --> 01:38:50,417
I'm sorry.

1029
01:38:51,717 --> 01:38:54,300
Try to understand
the strain I'm under.

1030
01:38:54,429 --> 01:38:56,887
I'm very worried about you.

1031
01:38:59,142 --> 01:39:01,429
Don't be sorry.

1032
01:39:03,271 --> 01:39:06,013
I didn't mean
to act like that in there.

1033
01:39:06,149 --> 01:39:07,981
It's me.

1034
01:39:10,778 --> 01:39:12,940
I'm OK now, though.

1035
01:39:14,490 --> 01:39:17,152
- I'm OK.
- Good.

1036
01:39:20,329 --> 01:39:22,991
Well, I'm starved.
Do you want something to eat?

1037
01:39:23,124 --> 01:39:25,161
Sure.

1038
01:39:28,129 --> 01:39:30,416
Well, this looks great.

1039
01:39:30,548 --> 01:39:32,209
I've been thinking, Robin.

1040
01:39:32,341 --> 01:39:34,423
Maybe we should take
a couple of days off.

1041
01:39:34,552 --> 01:39:38,295
Get a boat, go up the lake or something.
What do you think?

1042
01:39:59,202 --> 01:40:00,613
Why did you do that?

1043
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:05,656
So nobody can get in.

1044
01:40:07,084 --> 01:40:08,666
What's the matter, Robin?

1045
01:40:10,046 --> 01:40:11,753
You know what's the matter.

1046
01:40:11,881 --> 01:40:13,792
No, I don't. What is it?

1047
01:40:16,969 --> 01:40:19,006
It's that goddamn girl!

1048
01:40:19,931 --> 01:40:21,842
What girl?

1049
01:40:23,142 --> 01:40:26,806
- The one that's like me.
- What do you mean, like you?

1050
01:40:26,938 --> 01:40:31,227
Oh, you think I don't know she's around?
She's right out there.

1051
01:40:32,777 --> 01:40:35,519
- There is no girl.
- That's a lie!

1052
01:40:37,532 --> 01:40:41,526
- No, it isn't, Robin.
- She'll do everything I can do, won't she?

1053
01:40:41,661 --> 01:40:44,153
And you won't miss me at all.

1054
01:40:44,288 --> 01:40:46,780
What are you trying to say, Robin?

1055
01:40:54,423 --> 01:40:57,666
- Company's coming.
- Yes, you know that.

1056
01:40:59,178 --> 01:41:01,715
There'll be you and me...

1057
01:41:03,975 --> 01:41:07,718
...and Dr Ives and Childress.

1058
01:41:11,566 --> 01:41:13,603
And that girl makes five.

1059
01:41:15,778 --> 01:41:20,067
No, only four, Robin. You can see
that the table is set just for four.

1060
01:41:23,911 --> 01:41:26,448
That's right.

1061
01:41:26,581 --> 01:41:29,073
I won't <i>be</i> here. I'll be dead.

1062
01:41:30,126 --> 01:41:33,209
That girl's taking my place
after you poison me!

1063
01:41:35,381 --> 01:41:38,339
What's the matter, Susie?
What's the matter?

1064
01:41:38,467 --> 01:41:41,084
- Oh, God! Robin!
- Remember?

1065
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:43,131
I told you I didn't have to touch you
to hurt you.

1066
01:41:43,264 --> 01:41:44,675
Robin, please stop!

1067
01:41:44,807 --> 01:41:47,174
- Well, I'm hurting you now!
- Stop it!

1068
01:41:47,310 --> 01:41:50,302
Cos I don't love you anymore!
I'm tired of you!

1069
01:41:50,438 --> 01:41:52,930
You're killing her!

1070
01:41:53,065 --> 01:41:54,476
Stop!

1071
01:41:59,905 --> 01:42:02,112
Stop!

1072
01:42:05,745 --> 01:42:07,907
" No!

1073
01:42:10,875 --> 01:42:13,242
Susie, get up.

1074
01:42:14,128 --> 01:42:17,792
- I said get up.
- Robin! God, stop!

1075
01:42:17,923 --> 01:42:19,630
I can make you get up.

1076
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:25,795
Turn around.

1077
01:42:30,519 --> 01:42:31,554
UP-

1078
01:42:33,356 --> 01:42:35,563
- Robin...
- Up.

1079
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:38,942
Oh, God, Robin...

1080
01:42:39,487 --> 01:42:41,069
UP-

1081
01:42:43,074 --> 01:42:44,940
No, please.

1082
01:42:58,255 --> 01:43:00,417
Turn around.

1083
01:43:03,052 --> 01:43:05,043
Again.

1084
01:43:07,181 --> 01:43:09,297
Faster.

1085
01:43:09,433 --> 01:43:11,344
Faster.

1086
01:43:11,477 --> 01:43:13,593
Faster. Faster!

1087
01:43:14,522 --> 01:43:16,388
Faster. Turn!

1088
01:43:17,149 --> 01:43:19,311
Again. Turn.

1089
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:22,276
Faster. Faster!

1090
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:42,877
Here. Gimme your hand.

1091
01:44:03,112 --> 01:44:05,444
Hi, pal.

1092
01:44:05,573 --> 01:44:08,156
Thought I'd drop by to say hello.

1093
01:44:09,577 --> 01:44:11,693
Long time no see.

1094
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,115
You're lookin' good.

1095
01:44:20,212 --> 01:44:22,579
Ah, too bad, Peter.
You almost made it.

1096
01:44:26,635 --> 01:44:28,217
Where's my son?

1097
01:44:31,015 --> 01:44:32,597
Why don't you give up?

1098
01:44:34,769 --> 01:44:36,555
You...

1099
01:44:42,109 --> 01:44:43,440
Oh, God! Shit!

1100
01:44:46,614 --> 01:44:49,697
Stop! Stop!

1101
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:19,136
All right, Peter.

1102
01:45:19,271 --> 01:45:21,057
You said
you wanted to see your son.

1103
01:45:22,107 --> 01:45:24,144
Go ahead and get him.

1104
01:45:49,176 --> 01:45:50,712
Robin?

1105
01:45:54,139 --> 01:45:55,345
Can you hear me?

1106
01:45:58,435 --> 01:46:00,301
Robin!

1107
01:46:03,023 --> 01:46:04,730
Please answer me.

1108
01:46:38,684 --> 01:46:40,550
Oh, my God.

1109
01:46:50,613 --> 01:46:51,899
Robin!

1110
01:46:59,246 --> 01:47:01,032
Where is he?

1111
01:47:13,302 --> 01:47:15,543
What have they done to you?

1112
01:47:28,192 --> 01:47:29,182
Son.

1113
01:47:30,986 --> 01:47:36,447
I know they told you I was dead, but...
they wanted me out of the way.

1114
01:47:40,913 --> 01:47:42,904
I never gave up.

1115
01:47:44,208 --> 01:47:46,745
I kept lookin' for you all the time.

1116
01:47:54,343 --> 01:47:56,880
Come on, Robin. Hey.

1117
01:47:58,681 --> 01:48:00,888
Don't you recognise your old man?

1118
01:48:04,436 --> 01:48:06,393
Peter!

1119
01:48:07,564 --> 01:48:09,180
No!

1120
01:48:13,153 --> 01:48:14,564
Hang on, Robin.

1121
01:48:26,959 --> 01:48:30,077
Reach up with your other hand.
Come on.

1122
01:48:33,799 --> 01:48:35,460
Grab a hold of my jacket.

1123
01:48:37,428 --> 01:48:39,135
Climb over me.

1124
01:48:39,263 --> 01:48:41,470
That's it. Come on.

1125
01:48:41,598 --> 01:48:42,838
You can do it.

1126
01:48:43,934 --> 01:48:46,141
That's it. That's it.

1127
01:48:58,907 --> 01:49:00,944
No!

1128
01:49:01,076 --> 01:49:02,612
Oh, God!

1129
01:49:39,656 --> 01:49:41,317
Robin!

1130
01:49:53,295 --> 01:49:57,163
All right. Get 'em outta here.
Get 'em outta my sight.

1131
01:50:24,409 --> 01:50:26,525
Good morning.

1132
01:50:27,996 --> 01:50:31,785
I made some coffee.
Would you like some?

1133
01:50:33,669 --> 01:50:35,785
No?

1134
01:50:35,921 --> 01:50:37,958
It's warmer by the fire.

1135
01:50:39,675 --> 01:50:43,088
How did you sleep? OK?

1136
01:50:48,058 --> 01:50:51,471
I was here most of the night.
I guess you don't remember.

1137
01:50:53,689 --> 01:50:56,181
Move a little closer to the fire.

1138
01:50:58,861 --> 01:51:02,650
I know what you've been going through
these past couple of days.

1139
01:51:02,781 --> 01:51:05,193
I know how exhausted you must be.

1140
01:51:06,326 --> 01:51:08,693
It'll take more than one night's sleep.

1141
01:51:10,289 --> 01:51:12,451
I know how I feel.

1142
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:16,667
Peter was my friend.

1143
01:51:17,713 --> 01:51:20,205
Maybe the best friend I'll ever have.

1144
01:51:20,340 --> 01:51:23,674
But I had to do what I did.
I mean, you saw what happened.

1145
01:51:25,304 --> 01:51:28,672
Peter could have saved Robin.
Instead, he let him go.

1146
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:32,433
He deliberately killed his son.

1147
01:51:34,813 --> 01:51:37,805
I hope you don’t judge me too harshly.

1148
01:51:37,941 --> 01:51:40,683
I can't say
what I did was right or wrong.

1149
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:45,654
I only know I acted...
and it's done.

1150
01:51:48,118 --> 01:51:49,654
Robin is gone.

1151
01:51:51,830 --> 01:51:53,912
Peter is gone.

1152
01:51:58,045 --> 01:52:00,912
And you're the only one
who matters now.

1153
01:52:03,050 --> 01:52:05,758
Yes, I know that hurts.

1154
01:52:05,886 --> 01:52:08,423
That hurts so bad,
you wanna lie down and die.

1155
01:52:08,555 --> 01:52:10,717
But you have to survive.

1156
01:52:12,059 --> 01:52:15,051
You're a healthy, strong, young girl.

1157
01:52:15,896 --> 01:52:18,183
And you must survive.

1158
01:52:23,278 --> 01:52:26,896
You'll begin by putting
all the tragedies behind you.

1159
01:52:27,866 --> 01:52:31,075
I think that'll be easier
if you accept my help.

1160
01:52:32,621 --> 01:52:36,330
All the bad things you heard about me
just aren't true.

1161
01:52:36,458 --> 01:52:38,665
I'm not a bad man.

1162
01:52:39,711 --> 01:52:42,169
All I want is for you to trust me.

1163
01:52:43,590 --> 01:52:45,831
Time will take care of the hurting.

1164
01:52:48,011 --> 01:52:50,218
That's the simple truth.

1165
01:52:53,308 --> 01:52:55,424
Tears are good.

1166
01:52:56,770 --> 01:52:58,932
Don't be afraid of crying.

1167
01:53:01,650 --> 01:53:03,561
Tears are just what we need right now.

1168
01:53:05,487 --> 01:53:08,149
I'll be a good father to you, Gillian.

1169
01:53:08,282 --> 01:53:10,489
You can depend on that.

1170
01:53:36,435 --> 01:53:38,301
Gillian!

1171
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:54,366
Where are you?

1172
01:53:56,163 --> 01:53:58,495
Where are you?

1173
01:54:22,814 --> 01:54:24,430
You go to hell!
