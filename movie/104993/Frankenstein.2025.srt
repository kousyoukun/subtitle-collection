1
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:25,208
(序幕)

2
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:37,750
(1857年,极北方)

3
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:56,250
船长!
Captain!

4
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:03,375
船长!
Captain!

5
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,583
我们能谈谈吗?
Can we talk?

6
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:14,708
我们非突破冰阵不可
Hmm.
We must break through the ice.

7
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,000
大伙们又饿又累
The men are hungry and exhausted.

8
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,833
照这速度下去,后果不堪设想
We cannot keep up this pace without consequence.

9
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:26,708
大家听好!
Listen up, men!

10
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:30,249
我们进度越落后
The more we delay the labor,

11
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,666
冰就会黏得越紧
the firmer the grasp of the ice will become.

12
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:34,750
继续干活
The work continues.

13
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:36,208
各组轮流工作
Rotate each group.

14
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:37,958
船长,恕我直言
Sir, with respect...

15
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:39,999
大伙们需要你的保证
The men need assurances.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,040
保证?
Assurances?

17
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:45,082
是,船一脱困就返回圣彼得堡
Yes, that we will head back to St. Petersburg once we free the ship.

18
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:47,540
他们认为船体撑不了远航,想知道...
They don't think we'll be seaworthy for long and they want to know--

19
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,125
听好!
Listen up!

20
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:55,874
你们和这位军官都不该心有旁念
It is neither your place, nor the officer here, to think anything...

21
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:59,749
既然接下任务,就要完成目标
We signed up for a mission and we will see it to completion.

22
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,749
我们一定会抵达北极
We will reach the North Pole.

23
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,125
懂了吗?
Is it understood?

24
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,750
发生爆炸,船长
An explosion, Captain.

25
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,083
大约三公里外
About two miles away.

26
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,083
带几个人一起去
Get the men.

27
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,332
雪橇犬毫发无伤
The sled dogs are unharmed.

28
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,082
那这些血从何而来?
Then where does all this blood come from?

29
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,583
在这边,船长!
Over here, Captain!

30
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,541
有个人受伤,他严重失血
A wounded man, he's lost a lot of blood.

31
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:26,041
肩膀有伤,他的腿断了
Wound to the shoulder, his leg is broken.

32
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,665
他被熊攻击吗?
Bear attack?

33
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,874
应该不是,船长
I don't think so, Captain.

34
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,708
拉森,帮我脱掉他的靴子
Larsen, help me with his boot.

35
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:43,666
是义肢
A prosthetic leg.

36
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,125
把他放到木板上
Put him on the board.

37
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,458
快点!立刻回船上!
Hurry! To the ship! Now!

38
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,583

00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,332
我们带上船的人在哪里?
Where is that man we brought onboard?

47
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,250
他人呢?
Where?

48
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,875
那是什么鬼东西?牠想要什么?
What is that thing? What does it want?

49
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:35,333
把他交给我!

00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,375
维多!
Victor!

53
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:20,791
我干掉牠了
I killed it.

54
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:22,750
我干掉牠了
I killed it.

55
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,082
牠还活着!
It's still alive!

56
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,207
梯子!
Ladder!

57
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,625
把梯子拉上来!
Pull up the ladder!

58
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:58,875
把他交给我!
Bring him to me!

59
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,540
剩下几发子弹?
How many shots are left?

60
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,540
一发,但杀不了牠
One, but it can't kill it.

61
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:21,583
我知道
I know.

62
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,875
我不是要瞄准牠
I'm not aiming for him.

63
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:18,875
鸦片酊能减轻疼痛,喝吧
Laudanum, to ease the pain. Drink it. Drink it.

64
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,624
我在哪里?

65
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,332
这是丹麦皇家船舰,地平线号
You are on the Royal Danish ship, Horisont.

00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,249

六个
Six.

69
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,208
牠会回来夺走更多条人命
It will come back and kill many more.

70
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:42,249
必要时会把你们都杀光 除非你们把我交给牠
All of you, if necessary, unless you deliver me to it.

71
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,457
不用,牠已经死了
No, no. It's gone.

72
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,499
牠沉入冰冷海水中,已经死了
It sank in the freezing waters. It's dead.

73
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,125
牠没死!
No, it is not!

74
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:48,833
牠不会死
It cannot die.

75
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,458
我曾经想摧毁牠
I have tried to destroy it.

76
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,416
信不信由你们
Whether you believe me or not,

77
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,250
牠会回来...找我
it will come back... for me.

78
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,125
到了那时
And when it does,

79
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:06,665
你得保证要把我放在冰原上
you must promise that you will put me out on the ice

80
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:07,916
让牠将我带走
and let it take me.

81
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,125
求求你
Please.

82
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,625
那是何等怪物?
What manner of creature is that?

83
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:17,125
究竟是何等恶魔创造牠的?

84

是我

是我

86

00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:32,375
我已决心让我恶行的回忆随我消亡
I had determined that the memory of my evils should die with me.

88

我要说的话有些是事实

00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,833
维多弗兰肯斯坦
Victor Frankenstein.

93
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:51,333
这是我父亲为我取的名字
It was my father who gave me that name.

94
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,332
你知道这名字的意义吗?
Do you know what it means?

95
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,791
我知道,征服者
I believe I do, yes. Conqueror.

96
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,749
最大的赢家
One that wins it all.

97
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,916
对,一切都从他而起
Yes. It all started with him.

98
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,458
我的父亲

00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,541
我父亲是男爵,也是卓越的外科医生
My father was a baron and a preeminent surgeon.

108
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,665
他娶我的母亲主要是图一时之便
He had married my mother largely out of convenience,

109
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,749
因为她的嫁妆可观且血统高贵
as her dowry was considerable and her lineage noble.

110
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:53,208
我父亲便得以保住爵位和家族庄园
It furnished my father with the means to preserve his rank and family estate.

111
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,040
他经常不在我们身边
He was absent from our lives,

112
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:11,041
但只要回家 从上到下都对他唯命是从

而其他时候...
The rest of the time...

父亲
Father.

117
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,708
其他时候,母亲由我独占
The rest of the time, Mother was mine.

118
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,666
不行,拿过来
No, bring that here.

119
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,165
肉里的盐分会滋养血液
The salts in the meat will enrich your blood,

120
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,541
母子均能受益

121
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,833
记得你是一人吃两人补吗?
You eat for two, remember?

122
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,083
吃啊
Go on.

123
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,291
这很营养
It's nutritious.

124
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,500
守护天使
Guardian angel.

125
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,500
贴心的伴侣
Sweet companion.

126
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,416
请长相左右,勿弃我而去
Stand by my side and do not leave me.

127
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:13,166
以你的斗篷荫庇我,以及...
Under your mantle,
shelter me, and...

128
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:18,624
他们争论不休,隔着墙也听得到
I would hear them through the wall, arguing incessantly,

129
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:23,041
互相叫骂,吵着家产、庄园...还有我
yelling at each other about wealth, estate... and me.

130
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,541
他们的声音让我恐惧不已
Their voices filled me with fear.

131
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,083
Maman?

132
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,208
Maman?

133
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,207
他鄙视我们母子
The man despised us both.

134
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:52,125
我们乌黑的发丝、深黝的双眸
Our raven black hair, our deep, dark eyes.

135
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:56,790
连我们的寡言,有时神经质的性格
Even our quiet, at times nervous disposition

136
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,583
似乎也会让他恼怒无比

144
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,000

145
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,750
女性心脏质量何以有别?

146
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:31,666
是情感深度?
Depth of emotion?

147
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,958
还是容易忧郁?
Tendency to the melancholic?

148
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:39,957
父亲,是质量、血容积 肌肉含血量所致
Mass. Volume of blood, Father. Muscular irrigation.

149
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:43,332
说得对,组织中没有性灵内容
Quite. There is no spiritual content in tissue,

150
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,290
肌肉中也没有情感
and no emotion in a muscle.

151
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,875
请描述三尖瓣的主要功能
Now, describe the main function of the tricuspid valve, please.

152
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,790
我忘了,父亲,但我一定会想起来
I cannot recall, Father, but I'm sure I will remember.

153
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,250
对,你迟早会想起来
Yeah, I'm sure you will.

154
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,999
象牙不会流血,维多
Ivory does not bleed, Victor.

155
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,333
但是人类会
Flesh does.

156
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,415
等你想到一个事实,病人大概断气了
By the time you remember a fact, your patient could be dead.

157
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,791
了解吗?
You understand?

158
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,333
三尖瓣的主要功能
The main function of the tricuspid valve

159
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,083
是防止血液回流到腔静脉
is to prevent the reflux of blood into the vena cava.

160
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,916
手不行,打不得了
No, not your hands. Not anymore.

161
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,708
那是你的医术与意志的工具
They are now the instruments of your craft and will,

162
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,083
必须妥善照顾
and we must care for them.

163
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,666
你的脸倒是虚荣的皮相
Your face, however, is vanity.

164
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:46,833
维多,你继承我的姓氏,以及声誉
You bear my name, Victor, and with it my reputation.

165
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,500
希望你铭记在心
I pray you remember that.

166
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,583
我有预感你拿到好牌,很棒
I feel you have something very good, parce que...

167
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,082
三
Three...

168
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,415
二
Two...

169
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,375
一
One...

170
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,541
怎么可能?
That's impossible.

171
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,541
我来洗牌
I'll shuffle.

172
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,583
母亲?
Mother?
Maman?

173
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,999
父亲!
Father!

174
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,416
父亲,妈妈不舒服
Father. It's Mother.

175
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,665
我要大量热水和干净麻布,马上去拿
Maman.
I need hot water and clean linen. A lot of it.

176
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:41,832
- 遵命 - 不,维多!
- Now. - Sir.

177
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:42,833
妈妈?
- No, Victor! - Mother?
- Maman! - Victor!

178
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,999
父亲!
Father! Father!

179
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,541
拜托救救她!
- Victor! - Save her, please!

180
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:41,166
我把母亲视为不可分割的一部分
My mother, whom I had come to consider a part of my very self,

181
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,625
我以为她永远不会离去
she who I thought would never leave,

182
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:49,416
她原本还活着...现在却死了
she who was life... was now death.

183
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,916
她眼中的光芒熄灭
Her eyes extinguished,

184
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:57,125
她的笑容哺育着冰冷大地
her smile feeding the cold earth.

185
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
出去!
Leave!

186
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,791
全都出去!
All of you, leave!

187
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:18,125
宇宙有一部分被掏空
A part of the universe had been hollowed out

188
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,916
苍穹如今永暗无光
and the firmament was now permanently dark.

189
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,083
把眼睛遮起来
Now, cover your eyes.

190
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,833
我叫你看才能看
Don't look until I tell you to.

191
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,582
可以了
Now.

192
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:36,832
威廉从小就性情开朗又爱笑
William grew full of sunshine and smiles.

193
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:41,583
他更沉着、温和,更受我父亲的疼爱
He was of a calmer, gentler disposition, clearly favored by my father.

194
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,707
谢谢,父亲
Thank you, Father.

195
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,458
不客气,儿子
Oh, it's a pleasure, my boy.

196
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,666
他如同微风,我好似乌云
He was the breeze, I was the storm cloud.

197
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:53,957
他笑容满面,而我愁眉紧锁
He was all laughter, I was all frowns.

198
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,083
拿起缰绳
Pick up the reins.

199
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,416
你看我,父亲,看啊
Look at me, Father. Look at me.

200
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,916
生活多了些什么
There was something more.

201
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,500
应该说,是少了些什么
Or rather, something was missing.

202
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,082
我的母亲一命归西
My mother had died

203
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:12,624
死于当代最负盛名医生之手
at the hands of the most distinguished doctor of his day:

204
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,875
也就是我父亲
My father.

205
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:18,708
一个想法...由心而生
An idea... took shape in my mind.

206
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,415
请你定义循环系统
Define the circulatory system, if you will...

207
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:25,040
命中注定,无可避免...
Inevitable, unavoidable...

208
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,957
...说出《心血运动论》中所述内容
...as enunciated in De Motu Cordis.

209
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,041
...直到成真
...until it became truth.

210
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:31,500
父亲?
Father?

211
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,082
你任由她死去,对吧?
You let her die, did you not?

212
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:41,124
你一定知道,我已尽全力救她了
I did everything in my power to save her. You must know that.

213
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,416
所以你失败了
So you failed.

214
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,625
没有人能征服死亡
- No one can conquer death. - Mm-hmm.

215
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,541
我会的,我会征服它
I will. I will conquer it.

216
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,333
你懂的我都会懂,而且懂更多
Everything you know, I will know. And more.

217
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,125
今天的课上得差不多了
I think we've done quite enough for today.

218
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,041
我那天晚上脱胎换骨
I was born anew that night.

219
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,291
我见到一个幻觉
I had a vision.

220
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,583
我人生头一次看到...
I saw, for the first time...

221
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,125
黑暗天使
the Dark Angel.

222
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,416
祂答应我一件事
And it made me a promise.

223
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:35,833
我会拥有控制生死的力量
I would have command over the forces of life and death.

224
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,332
我会成为父亲这种优秀外科医生
I would become every ounce the surgeon my father was.

225
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,499
我的野心和影响力将超越他
I would surpass him in ambition and in reach.

226
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,875
守护天使...

227
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:46,916
幻觉历历在目
The vision was so clear.

228
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:51,500
比我在清醒或做梦时更清楚
Clearer than anything I'd ever seen in my waking hours or dreams.

229
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:55,916
但怎么可能?
But how?

230
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,708
我很快就遭逢家道中落
My downfall was swift.

231
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,040
我母亲的种植园 发生两次造反和一场火灾
Two revolts and a fire on my mother's plantations

232
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,708
家产日益缩水
dwindled the family fortune.

233
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,583
我们保有庄园,但失去了一切
We kept the estate, but lost everything else.

234
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:49,582
威廉去投靠维也纳的亲戚
William went to one side of the family in Vienna

235
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,916
而我先去伦敦,再到爱丁堡
and I to London, then Edinburgh.

236
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:56,625
几十年来,我在那里试图...
And there, for decades, I tried to...

237
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:02,666
拓展学术界的狭隘局限
expand the narrow limits of academia.

238
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,083
生命
Life.

239
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:10,499
这...就是生命,各位
This... is life, gentlemen.

240
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,707
(1855年,皇家医学院纪律法庭)

241
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:13,958
我们出生
We are born.

242
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:18,416
还来不及站好,就倒下了
Hmm?
And no sooner do we rise, we fall.

243
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:20,625
死亡
Death.

244
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:26,040
在站立和倒下之间的空白中
And in the space between that rise and fall,

245
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,833
则是我们短浅的见识
our humble little purview.

246
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,958
我们控制不了出生
Now, birth is not in our hands.

247
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,041
对吧?
Is it?

248
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:40,166
受孕,那道火花,催生出思想与灵魂
Conception, that spark, the animation of thought and soul.

249
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,375
那唯有神能掌控
That is in God's hands.

250
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,250
神
God.

251
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:46,458
但是死亡
But death.

252
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,500
那才是挑战所在
Ah, now there lies the challenge.

253
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,291
也应该是我们关切的重点
That should be our concern.

254
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,416
理应如此
It should be.

255
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:58,875
我们凭什么?我们又不是神,对吧?
Who are we to do so? We are not gods, are we?

256
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:02,790
但如果我们如众神般恣意妄为
But if we are to behave as immodestly as gods,

257
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:05,666
至少我们必能创造出奇迹
we must, at the very least, deliver miracles.

258
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,291
有道理吧?
Wouldn't you say?

259
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:12,499
点燃这些年轻学子心中的神圣火花
Ignite a divine spark...

260
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,749
教导他们反抗,而非顺从
...in these young students' minds.
Teach them defiance rather than obedience.

261
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:21,499
让他们目睹人类可洞悉 大自然的奥秘,阻止死亡
Show that man may pursue nature to her hiding places and stop death.

262
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,500
不只是减缓,而是彻底终止!
Not slow it down, but stop it entirely!

263
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:33,416
安静!
Silence. Silence!

264
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:42,583
你到底打算怎么传授异想天开之事?
How exactly do you propose to teach what is impossible?

265
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,165
复合主题,尸体
Composite subject, the body.

266
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:51,416
那是某店主的尸体 死后不久就送到我这里来
That of a shopkeeper, delivered mere moments after expiration.

267
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:53,624
外露的大脑功能正常
The brain laid bare but functional,

268
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:56,540
脊椎分支和迷走神经完好无损
the spinal branches and vagal nerves intact.

269
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,082
你们能看到细如发丝的疤痕
You may observe the hair-thin scars.

270
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:01,957
靠我的技巧,无需粗陋的缝线
No coarse stitching needed by my own technique.

271
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:02,999
这只手臂
The arm, you see,

272
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,665
来自其他样本,木匠的尸体
comes from another specimen, that of a carpenter.

273
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:08,875
肌肉、韧带和神经都接起来了
The muscles, ligaments, nerves, all connected now.

274
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,040
电流通过人体会导致
Now, the spasmodic movement of the body

275
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:34,166
痉挛性运动,这不是新鲜事
caused from the electric current, this is not new.

276
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,707
不稀奇,然而能量流通过身体
It's not new. However, the flow of energy through the body

277
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,374
遵循的是截然不同的概念
follows a different notion entirely.

278
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,291
一种称为「气」的东方概念
An Eastern notion called qi.

279
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:45,124
它顾及体内外的生命能量流
Now, it considers the vital flow of energy both within and without.

280
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,874
我利用插入六个穴位的针...
I'm utilizing needles in six--

281
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:51,041
安静!坐下!
Quiet!
Sit down!

282
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:56,165
这是听证会,博士,不是奇人异士秀
This is a hearing, Doctor, not a carnival act.

283
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:58,082
你这么做无济于事,维多
You're not helping your cause, Victor.

284
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:00,749
这种流电骗局唬不了人的
This galvanic trickery will simply not do.

285
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,833
骗局
Trickery.

286
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:04,791
骗局?
Trickery?

287
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:08,208
你确定?
Are you sure?

288
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,790
那不是骗局,而是决定
That is not trickery. That is a decision.

289
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:20,249
原分属两具尸体的眼手协调能力
Motor coordination between the eye of one dead man and the arm of another,

290
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,665
注入了新意志和基本理解力
infused with a new will and the rudiments of understanding.

291
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:27,541
死去的脑部有理解力?
Understanding in a brain that already died?

292
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:29,708
现在放开
Release now.

293
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:31,916
拜托你
Please.

294
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,708
礼多人不怪嘛
"Please" always helps.

295
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:39,207
立刻关掉,马上,你这江湖郎中
Turn that off at once. At once, you charlatan.

296
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:42,165
这是未来和可能实现的事
This is the future. This is possible.

297
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:44,332
为何不加以研究?将资料数据化?
Why not study it? Why not quantify it?

298
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:50,708
这是邪恶、可憎、猥亵之事!
This is unholy.
An abomination.

299
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:55,957
生命由神赐予并收回,维多
An obscenity!
God gives life, and God takes it, Victor.

300
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:58,750
也许神是力有未逮!
Perhaps God is inept!

301
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:02,374
我们得修正祂的错误!
And it is we that must amend his mistakes!

302
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,124
别让这些老蠢材打压你们的想法!
Do not let these old fools extinguish your voice!

303
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:08,457
要获得答案,唯有不再屈从
The answers only come when coaxed by disobedience,

304
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:11,416
挣脱恐惧和胆怯的教条!
free of fear and cowardly dogma!

305
00:25:25,916 --> 00:25:27,208
克伦比教授
Professor Krempe.

306
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:05,874
弗兰肯斯坦男爵 我是海因利奇哈兰德
Baron Frankenstein, my name is Heinrich Harlander,

307
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:08,749
我带了一封介绍信
and I carry with me a letter of introduction

308
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,165
是你弟弟威廉所写的
from your brother, William.

309
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:11,207
我弟弟?
From my brother?

310
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:13,707
我请他引荐,盼得与你相识
I asked for the privilege of your acquaintance.

311
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:15,624
不会占用你太多时间
It won't take but a minute of your time.

312
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:17,041
- 你先请 - 那好吧
- Please. - Very well.

313
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:21,750
所以威廉要来看我,对吧?
So William is coming to see me, is that it?

314
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:24,166
对,几天之后
Yeah, in a matter of days.

315
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:29,166
他想介绍你认识未婚妻 她碰巧是我侄女
He wants to introduce you to his fiancée. My niece, as it happens.

316
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:36,165
伊莉莎白哈兰德,很出色的年轻女士
Elizabeth Harlander, a very nice young lady,

317
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:37,583
刚脱离修道院生活不久
fresh from convent life.

318
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:39,416
这些照片是我拍的
The photographs are mine.

319
00:26:39,958 --> 00:26:43,040
威廉在金融界卓然有成
William has become quite successful in the world of finance.

320
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:44,874
他打响一己之名号了
He's making a name for himself.

321
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:47,041
岂有此理!一己之名号?
Ha! A name? For himself?

322
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:52,583
且不论意愿 只怕这家族名号两兄弟都有份
Well, I'm afraid we both share that name, whether we like it or not.

323
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:54,999
我拜读过你在《刺胳针》的文章
I read your article in The Lancet.

324
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,875
你真心认为你办得到?
You really believe you can do it?

325
00:26:58,291 --> 00:26:59,375
组出一个人?
Assemble a man?

326
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:03,500
一整具新身体?赋予它生命?
A full new body? And give it life?

327
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,207
你今天也看到了吧?
You saw it today, didn't you?

328
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,665
其实我只看到你被炮轰得体无完肤
What I saw was a crucifixion, really.

329
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:11,457
根本来不及说什么就没戏唱了
You were done for before you uttered a word.

330
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:12,791
我还是让他们看到了
I still showed them.

331
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:14,707
看到什么?
What?

332
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:15,666
真相
The truth.

333
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:18,125
他们晚餐前就会忘得一干二净
They will forget by suppertime.

334
00:27:19,541 --> 00:27:22,000
好啦...那你觉得呢?
Yes, yes, yes. But what did you think? Hmm?

335
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:25,666
我觉得很高明
I thought it was brilliant.

336
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:28,207
没错,我也知道
It was. I know.

337
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:31,082
但你却如孩童般手舞足蹈
But you are like a child, so excited,

338
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:34,291
紧抓着新宠物不放,结果适得其反
clutching your new pet so tightly that you're strangling it.

339
00:27:35,541 --> 00:27:37,500
所以我才很担心你
That is why I worry about you.

340
00:27:38,708 --> 00:27:41,165
普罗米修斯,你管得住你的火吗?
Can you contain your fire, Prometheus?

341
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:44,125
还是大功告成前,手就烧焦了?
Or are you going to burn your hands before delivering it?

342
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:47,583
不无可能
Quite.

343
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:51,957
恕我直言,但我今天身心具疲
Please do not think me rude, but my day has proven long enough,

344
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:55,082
实在不宜和陌生人寒暄应酬
and I believe myself totally unfit for the company of strangers.

345
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:56,665
如果没别的事了...
So if there's nothing more--

346
00:27:56,666 --> 00:27:58,666
但精彩的还在后头
Oh, but there is. Much more.

347
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,707
我已经在爱丁堡找到住所
I've taken quarters in Edinburgh.

348
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:07,207
三天后,我们跟威廉和伊莉莎白碰面
Three days from now, we are to meet with William and Elizabeth.

349
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:10,416
那天晚上,我会改变你的命运
And that evening, I will change your destiny.

350
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,041
我要让你见识一个不同凡响之物
I will show you something extraordinary.

351
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:24,500
- 你人真好 - 谢谢,给你

352
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:35,208
桃子,把桃子转过来,转啊
The peach. The peach. Turn the peach. Turn it.

353
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:38,333
你又偷吃了
You bit it again.

354
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:40,833
你吃了桃子
You're eating the peaches.

355
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,333
这个是死亡的象征
This is a memento mori.

356
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:49,415
桃子则是象征生命和青春 结果被你吃下去?
The peach, symbol of life and youth, and you bite into it?

357
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:51,707
- 人家饿嘛,奇奇 - 别叫我奇奇
- I was hungry, Kiki. - Don't call me Kiki.

358
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:53,750
维多弗兰肯斯坦男爵到了,老爷
Baron Victor Frankenstein, sir.

359
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:56,916
你可以走了
You can leave.

360
00:28:57,708 --> 00:28:58,791
不好意思
Forgive me.

361
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:01,207
欢迎光临
Welcome.

362
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:02,291
哈兰德先生
Herr Harlander.

363
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,915
摄影是一门新兴艺术
A young art, photography.

364
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:07,249
再见,奇奇
Goodbye, Kiki.

365
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:09,208
我已经嗜爱成痴了
Already a passion of mine.

366
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:11,041
资料带来了吗?
Did you bring the papers?

367
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:13,625
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

368
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:19,500
- 你真厉害 - 谢谢
- You're extraordinary. - Thank you.

369
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:27,625
你要利用神经系统传送能量流
Hmm.
You're using the nervous system to deliver the surge of energy.

370
00:29:28,708 --> 00:29:29,665
对吧?
Are you not?

371
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:30,915
没错
Correct.

372
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:34,999
所以你掌控的生命力难以持久
And thus the sustainability of the life force you command

373
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,416
会逐渐减弱、消失
is very brief, wanes, evaporates.

374
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:41,125
何以见得?
How so?

375
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:48,708
那次解说中 你因自尊心作祟而中断示范
At the lecture, you ended your demonstration out of pride.

376
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:53,624
但实情是当时的流电生命力
But really, because the galvanic life force

377
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,540
已经变弱了,对吧?
was already fading, was it not?

378
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:57,208
先生,你是外科医生吗?
Are you yourself a surgeon, sir?

379
00:29:57,708 --> 00:30:00,040
是,陈年往事了,我当过军医
Yeah, once upon a time. An army surgeon.

380
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:02,707
医术也不怎么高明
Not a particularly skilled one, either.

381
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:05,957
但我借此奠定了财富基础
But it allowed me to secure the rudiments of my fortune.

382
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:07,957
我拥有几座兵工厂
I own a few ammunition factories.

383
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:10,875
- 你是军火商 - 是务实派
- An arms merchant. - A realist.

384
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:13,332
你知道伊夫林桌吗?
Are you familiar with the Evelyn Tables?

385
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:15,957
当然,其名来自买家约翰伊夫林爵士
Of course. Acquired by Sir John Evelyn,

386
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:17,999
一共四张木板,是精密的解剖标本
there are four planks, meticulous dissection,

387
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,040
是极早期欧洲文物,呈现了神经
some of the oldest in Europe, presenting the nerves,

388
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:22,082
血管和尸体动脉,怎么了?
veins and arteries of cadavers. What?

389
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:24,000
没错,但还有第五张
Yes. But there's a fifth one.

390
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,375
那张最让人拍案叫绝
The most compelling one.

391
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:33,125
巧夺天工,对吧?
Exquisite, is it not?

392
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,583
血肉黏附在木头上
Flesh rendered onto wood.

393
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:41,582
尸体平放在木板上,剥去层层血肉
The cadaver lies on the plank, is peeled away layer by layer,

394
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:45,749
用树脂把剩余组织黏在木头上
and the remaining tissue is lacquered with resin onto the wood.

395
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,707
- 这展示了淋巴系统 - 对
- It showcases the lymphatic system. - Yes.

396
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:52,790
穆斯林医生称为秘密的循环系统
Muslim medics called it the secret circulatory system.

397
00:30:52,791 --> 00:30:58,040
它只输送三公升体液,但网络庞大
It moves a mere three liters of fluid, but it's a vast network.

398
00:30:58,041 --> 00:31:00,000
- 真了不起 - 是啊
- Oh, it's remarkable. - Yes.

399
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:05,208
对我们和对你来说,关键差异在此
Now for us, for you, the important variation is here.

400
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:10,290
第九框架,一种非常精细
The ninth configuration. A very delicate,

401
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:13,749
接近空灵的结构,环绕着心脏
almost ethereal structure surrounding the heart.

402
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:17,166
它可以分配和储存能量
It can distribute, but also store energy.

403
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:23,207
对,如果能够启动且不破坏
Yes, if you can access that without destroying

404
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:25,832
- 周遭的组织... - 错了,不是正面
- the surrounding tissue-- - No. Not through the front.

405
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:29,291
是背面,脊柱、胸腔弯曲度
The back, spinal column, thoracic curvature.

406
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:30,832
原来如此
Of course.

407
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:36,415
超乎想像的能量流、结疤与再生能力
Flow of energy, scarring and regeneration beyond anyone's imagination.

408
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:37,708
永恒的生命
Life eternal.

409
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:43,041
我愿意提供你无限资源探究永生之道
I will endow your pursuit with unlimited resources.

410
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:47,250
你要什么回报?
And in exchange?

411
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,208
不用这么直言不讳
No need to become indelicate.

412
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:54,750
我们是寻找真理和超越的志同道合者
We're searchers for truth and transcendence, kindred spirits.

413
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,374
假以时日,我会向你讨个人情
I may in time ask you for a favor in return,

414
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:02,457
但主要是有幸 为后人记录你的研究过程
but it's mostly the privilege to record your process for posterity.

415
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:03,708
我不跟人共事
I work alone.

416
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,374
我不会吵到你
I'm very quiet.

417
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:09,416
哈兰德先生 威廉弗兰肯斯坦和你侄女到了
William Frankenstein and your niece, Herr Harlander.

418
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:14,208
我会考虑
I shall consider it.

419
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:16,625
一定会考虑
I'll consider it.

420
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,958
男爵
Baron.

421
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:23,208
此时还故作理智,才真叫人遗憾
Don't pretend to be reasonable now. It would be such a shame.

422
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,957
维多
Victor.

423
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,249
威廉!
William!

424
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,750
- 维多 - 看看你
- Victor. - Look at you.

425
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,624
天啊,你长好大了
My, you've grown.

426
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:43,333
这我可不敢居功
Through no merit of my own.

427
00:32:44,041 --> 00:32:46,041
介绍你认识我的未婚妻
May I introduce the woman I'm to marry.

428
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:48,250
伊莉莎白哈兰德小姐
Lady Elizabeth Harlander.

429
00:33:09,666 --> 00:33:11,500
幸会之至
Absolutely delighted.

430
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:19,333
其实我没那么讶异你被开除
Can't say I was shocked when you were expelled,

431
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,582
但他们不留情面地将你扫地出门
but the manner and virulence of your expulsion,

432
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,832
没必要这么绝
uncalled for, I'm sure.

433
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:24,915
不,有必要
No, it was called for. I earned it.

434
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:25,833
我是罪有应得

435
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,665
我证明了我是罪有应得 哈兰德先生,对吧?
I made it a point to earn it, wouldn't you say, Herr Harlander?

436
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:30,541
那确实是华丽退场
It was quite an exit, I assure you.

437
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,457
但你何必激怒他们?
Why provoke them?

438
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:37,874
何不继续低调行事,明哲保身?
Why not just carry on without calling attention to yourself in such a manner?

439
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:41,624
就算依你的标准也太保守了,威廉
How safe, even by your standards, William.

440
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:43,458
你的口吻和父亲如出一辙
You almost sound like Father.

441
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:47,874
我们的父亲最为圆滑得体
He was a most tactful man, our father.

442
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:50,874
他言行精确、谨慎、不失分寸
He was precise, discreet, measured.

443
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:55,374
反之,我就不懂谦逊何以是美德
I, on the other hand, fail to see why modesty is considered a virtue at all.

444
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:57,750
维多一向渴望成为目光焦点
Victor's always been one to harvest attention.

445
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:01,749
连我小时候也会保持沉默 消消他的气焰
Even as children, I mitigated his voice by staying silent.

446
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,749
也许做得太过火且频繁 维多,你说是吗?
Perhaps too much and far too many times, wouldn't you say, Victor?

447
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,375
如果生命能够再生
If life can be regenerated,

448
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:08,207
而非只是一种模拟
not as a mere simulation,

449
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:12,250
而是透过物理、化学方法的神圣行为 何必遮遮掩掩呢?
but as a divine act by physical, chemical means,
why whisper it?

450
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,875
你在笑吗?
You laugh?

451
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:19,707
- 你觉得好笑? - 是的,没错
- You're amused? - I must be, yes.

452
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:21,165
我的理念没有说清楚吗?
Are my ideas not clear?

453
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:23,790
你是讲得很理直气壮
You certainly expressed them loudly enough.

454
00:34:23,791 --> 00:34:25,124
你觉得一无是处?
Are they not worthwhile?

455
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:27,833
理念本身不会一无是处
Ideas are not worthwhile by themselves, I don't believe.

456
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:32,082
愿闻其详
Enlighten me, please.

457
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:34,374
就拿战争来说吧
Take the war, for example.

458
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:37,083
威廉,到我书房享用雪茄和白兰地?
William, cigar and brandy in my study?

459
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:41,291
你肯定听过我侄女发表过相关高见
Surely you've heard my niece expound on the matter before.

460
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:43,458
我们先失陪了
You'll excuse us.

461
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:50,541
好极了,请说,理念
Pray, carry on. Ideas.

462
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:57,416
这个嘛...荣誉、国家、勇气
Well... honor, country, valor.

463
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:01,707
这些崇高理念无疑有其价值
These surely are worthwhile, elevated ideas by themselves,

464
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:02,875
你同意吧?
wouldn't you agree?

465
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:06,375
只是男人却为了它们而送命
- Mm-hmm. - And nevertheless, men are dying for them.

466
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:08,957
死法绝不崇高
In a decidedly un-elevated way,

467
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:11,915
脸伏泥浆、血水呛喉
face down in the mud, choking on blood,

468
00:35:11,916 --> 00:35:13,208
痛苦惨叫
screaming in pain.

469
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:17,499
他们曾是某人的父亲、兄弟或儿子
Men that were fathers, brothers or sons to someone out there.

470
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,374
这些男儿曾被母亲喂养、清洗和抚育
Men that were fed, cleaned and nursed

471
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:21,375
并教导他们认识这个世界
and schooled into this world by their mothers,

472
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:23,749
结果却命丧于远方沙场
only to fall on a battlefield far away,

473
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,166
造成这些悲剧的政客却远在天边
far from those that provoke these tragedies.

474
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:31,458
他们安心在家,避开鲜血或刺刀
Those men remain at home, untouched by blood or bayonet,

475
00:35:32,416 --> 00:35:35,458
皮肉具全,身覆洁暖的毛毯
their skin unpierced, their blankets warm and clean.

476
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:40,874
这就是蠢材追求理念的下场
That is what happens when ideas are pursued by fools.

477
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:42,708
你认为我是蠢材?
And you think me a fool?
Hmm?

478
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:47,916
快去享用你的白兰地和雪茄吧
Run to your brandy and cigars.

479
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:49,958
他们在等你
The boys are waiting.

480
00:35:56,333 --> 00:36:01,166
人多少次以为碰见天使或恶魔
How often a man believes he's met an angel or a devil,

481
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:04,958
结果只是幻梦一场
only to find it is all an illusion.

482
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,750
我们所下的这盘棋
The game of chess we play...

483
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:13,000
只是在跟自己较量罢了
we play only against ourselves.

484
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:16,166
帮帮他
Help him.

485
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:17,625
帮帮他!
Help him!

486
00:36:18,791 --> 00:36:20,541
来,喝一点
Here you go. Drink some.

487
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:44,958
你最好跟我来
You better come with me.

488
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:47,290
没东西啊
Nothing.

489
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:48,958
船长,值班船员看到牠了
Sir, the watchman saw him.

490
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,457
牠在迷雾中绕着船走
Circling the ship. In the mist.

491
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:53,165
我们都看到牠淹死了
We all saw him drown.

492
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:54,415
船长
Sir.

493
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:56,124
大伙们都吓坏了
The men are terrified.

494
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:58,457
他们认为应该把那个人留在冰原上
They think that man should be surrendered to the ice

495
00:36:58,458 --> 00:36:59,708
了结此事
and be done with this.

496
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:04,458
他受我保护...
He is under my protection...

497
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:08,458
国王也为他撑腰!
and the protection of the Crown!

498
00:37:21,833 --> 00:37:24,832
几周后,我跟威廉、哈兰德同行
A few weeks later, I rode with William and Harlander

499
00:37:24,833 --> 00:37:27,457
越过水道,前往瓦都兹附近一座湖
to a lake near Vaduz across the channel.

500
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:31,040
那座塔楼是建来灌溉田地的过滤水厂
The tower was built as a water filtration plant to irrigate the fields.

501
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:34,083
一开战,这个公共建案就停工了
Public works, so construction was abandoned at the start of the war.

502
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:37,499
不是这场战争,是之前那场
Not this war, the one before.

503
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,708
或是再前一场,我记不清楚了
Or the one before that, I cannot quite remember.

504
00:37:44,541 --> 00:37:46,541
当我一看到它...
The moment I laid eyes on it...

505
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:48,666
那座塔楼
The tower.

506
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:52,916
我感受到命运的呼唤
I could feel destiny calling.

507
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,665
建物大致上完好无损
The structure's basically intact.

508
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:08,791
这里还有个从屋顶直通底部的通道
And there's a chute going from top, right to the bottom.

509
00:38:09,416 --> 00:38:11,165
我会妥善收拾你的家当
I can arrange for your belongings.

510
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:13,125
请人从爱丁堡运送过来
We'll bring them from Edinburgh.

511
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:29,958
我会满足你一切需求
Anything you need or want shall be granted.

512
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,625
- 一切需求? - 正是
- Anything? - Anything.

513
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:45,374
我已委托威廉包办 研究期间的相关事宜
I have secured William's service for the duration of the project.

514
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:47,041
我需要一间牢房
I'll need a holding cell.

515
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,541
- 和一间冷冻室,都要紧邻实验室 - 威廉
- And an ice chamber close to the lab. - William.

516
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:52,790
塔楼底部有两座泵浦蓄水池
There are two pump reservoirs at the base of the tower.

517
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:54,290
我们会进行翻修
We'll repurpose those.

518
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:56,207
我们得修理蒸气机
We shall need to recondition the steam engines.

519
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,165
需要充分燃料确保正常运转
We'll need enough fuel to make sure they run.

520
00:38:58,166 --> 00:39:02,207
那两处要安装四个高容量伏特电池
There and there, four high-capacity voltaic batteries,

521
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:04,082
正极和负极
positive and negative polarity,

522
00:39:04,083 --> 00:39:08,457
还要一组纯银的避雷针系统 能往下伸进实验室
and a lightning rod system of pure silver telescoping down into the lab.

523
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:13,791
好,我的承包商 能制造出你要的各种设备
Yes. My contractors can manufacture any and all equipment you may require.

524
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:19,250
那我们应该达成共识啰?
I take it then that we have an understanding?

525
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,791
那就一言为定
A bargain has been struck.

526
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,333
混蛋!
Bastard!

527
00:39:40,166 --> 00:39:41,208
这个不行
No. No. Not this one.

528
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:46,291
张开嘴巴
Aah. Open your mouth.

529
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:51,665
幸亏你快被绞死,不死也活不过一年
You, you're lucky to be hanged. You would have died within the year.

530
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:54,165
哈兰德先生答应我可以取得最佳样本
Herr Harlander promised me access to optimal specimens.

531
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:56,040
也许是吧,爵爷
Yeah, that he may have, your lordship,

532
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:57,458
但你也知道
but as you well know,

533
00:39:58,458 --> 00:40:00,874
犯罪得不偿失,在此尤为明证
crime doesn't pay, and it's a poor showing of it we have here.

534
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:02,665
他们全都是可怜的败类
They're wretches every one of them.

535
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,000
我深表遗憾
I'm sorry about that.

536
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:06,166
他背部很强壮,这个可以
That's a strong back. This one will do.

537
00:40:42,291 --> 00:40:43,332
稍后再来
Come back later.

538
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:44,500
告解?
Confession?

539
00:40:46,166 --> 00:40:48,041
这下我好奇了
I was intrigued.

540
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:54,791
那个纤细、虔诚的尤物要告解什么?
What would such a delicate, pious creature have to confess to?

541
00:40:57,166 --> 00:41:00,540
所幸的是,天赐良机
As luck would have it, an opportunity presented itself,

542
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,666
而我...
and I...

543
00:41:04,041 --> 00:41:05,666
我即将得知真相
I was about to find out.

544
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:28,750
神父,请赦免我的罪
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

545
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:33,290
你上次是何时告解,孩子?
How long has it been
since your last confession, my daughter?

546
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,583
不到一周前,神父,我当时在修道院
Barely a week, Father. I was in a convent.

547
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:37,166
才一周?
A week?

548
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,624
你这么快就犯了罪?
Tsk-tsk. Have you so hastily committed sin?

549
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:41,541
是的
I have.

550
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,958
是想法,不是行为
Sin of intent, not deed.

551
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:46,624
- 跟男人有关吧? - 是的
- A man, is it? - Yes.

552
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:48,000
我未婚夫的哥哥
My fiancé's brother.

553
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:50,707
是色欲?
Lust?

554
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:51,624
是憎恶
Hatred...

555
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:52,541
憎恶...

556
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,666
- 憎恶? - 他言行低俗、荒诞
- Hatred? - The man is appalling, grotesque.

557
00:41:57,916 --> 00:41:59,332
话说得真重
Harsh words.

558
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:00,915
相当不近人情,对吧?
Rather uncharitable, wouldn't you say?

559
00:42:00,916 --> 00:42:03,582
恕我直言,神父,你不认识对方
Respectfully, Father, you do not know this man.

560
00:42:03,583 --> 00:42:07,124
他想操控身边一切的人事物
He tries to control and manipulate everything and everyone around him.

561
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:09,874
他如同暴君,就爱以受害者自居
Like every tyrant, he delights in playing the victim.

562
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:11,332
我会说,他唯一的可取之处
His only advantage, I would say,

563
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:13,958
是他比他自认的更加大意
is he's far cruder than he believes himself to be.

564
00:42:14,916 --> 00:42:15,916
大意?
Cruder?

565
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,249
请说明一下,孩子
Uh, pray explain yourself, my child.

566
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:21,125
首先,要发现他很简单
For one, he's easy to spot.

567
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:26,333
连在赶集日的热闹街道上 也能轻易认出他
You can see him... even on a busy street on market day.

568
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:33,915
说吧,你多早就看到我了?
Tell me, how soon did you spot me?

569
00:42:33,916 --> 00:42:36,999
你还没看到我,我就看到你了 我话就说到这边
I saw you well before you saw me, I can say that much.

570
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,915
你用餐了吗?
Have you had supper?

571
00:42:37,916 --> 00:42:40,040
我没那么饿,男爵,谢谢
I'm not that hungry, Baron. Thank you.

572
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:41,916
我可是饿坏了
Well, I for one am famished.

573
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,582
- 谢谢你,大好人 - 谢谢
- Thank you, my good man. - Thank you, sir.

574
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:49,375
你买了什么书?能看看吗?
What books did you buy, hmm? May I?

575
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:51,166
猜猜看
Guess.

576
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,290
- 猜? - 我要你用猜的
- Guess? - Mm-hmm. I'd rather that you did.

577
00:42:53,291 --> 00:42:54,333
那好吧
Very well.

578
00:42:58,083 --> 00:42:59,291
是罗曼史...
A romance...

579
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:04,082
充斥着地中海阳光、绮罗与情爱纠葛
drenched in Mediterranean sun and silk and the skirmishes of love.

580
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:06,833
狗眼看人低,但意料之中
Insulting, but unsurprising.

581
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:08,833
是吗?
Really?

582
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:16,291
昆虫?
- Insects? - Mm.

583
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:20,583
我的科学喜好偏向微小生物
My interest in science leans towards the smallest things.

584
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:24,166
随着大自然或是神的节奏而律动
Moving with nature, perhaps the rhythms of God.

585
00:43:25,166 --> 00:43:29,458
我经常在寻找更纯粹、惊奇的事物
I've always searched for something more pure, marvelous.

586
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:35,375
你是在修道院寻找这个?
Is that what you were seeking in the convent?

587
00:43:37,958 --> 00:43:39,000
算是吧
In a way.

588
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:42,166
值得吗?
Was it worth it?

589
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
有任何事值得吗?
Is anything?

590
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:56,000
请与我共舞,弟媳
Permit me, sister.

591
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:01,625
此举不甚得体
This hardly seems appropriate.

592
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:03,291
有任何事得体吗?
Is anything?

593
00:44:07,791 --> 00:44:08,833
好极了
Very well.

594
00:44:19,416 --> 00:44:20,625
你笑了!
Laughter!

595
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:24,666
史无前例
And for the very first time,

596
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:27,666
我变得更关注生命
I became more interested in life

597
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:31,457
反而没那么在乎...
and somewhat less interested in death.

598
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:32,583
死亡

599
00:44:50,916 --> 00:44:55,333
主针有一套快速的螺栓系统
The main rod has a fast bolting system.

600
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:57,375
你有使用合金吗?
Did you use an alloy?

601
00:44:58,333 --> 00:44:59,874
我用了铜和锌
Copper and zinc.

602
00:44:59,875 --> 00:45:02,791
这...这样行不通,重做
This is... This simply will not do. Start over.

603
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:05,958
纯银是绝佳导体
Pure silver is a perfect conductor.

604
00:45:06,958 --> 00:45:09,124
威廉,你得留下来监工,拜托
William, you must stay behind. Please.

605
00:45:09,125 --> 00:45:11,124
我只信得过你
I trust you above anyone else.

606
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,458
再几天就好了
Only for a few more days.

607
00:45:20,708 --> 00:45:22,583
你抓不到的
You're not going to catch her.

608
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:28,916
好漂亮
Beautiful. Beautiful.

609
00:45:30,625 --> 00:45:32,832
要关起来还是放走?
- Should we trap her or let her go? - Mm...

610
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:33,791
关起来
Trap her.

611
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:38,250
我们总算有共通点了
Now we have something in common.

612
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:40,833
你的囚犯
A prisoner.

613
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:46,291
如先前约定 威廉负责兴建实验室和提供所需
As promised, William took dutiful charge of the laboratory build and needs.

614
00:45:48,416 --> 00:45:50,374
请帮我修那里
Can you fix that over there, please?

615
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:51,458
去帮忙
Go, help.

616
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:55,458
他完全依照我的指示行事
He followed my instructions to the letter.

617
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:58,833
电池
The battery.

618
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,083
现在都是纯银了
It's all pure silver now.

619
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:13,500
对应淋巴系统的传导点
Conduction points corresponding to the lymphatic system,

620
00:46:14,291 --> 00:46:18,166
做法错综复杂,但我搞定了
which was quite complex.
- But I managed. - Mm-hmm.

621
00:46:59,833 --> 00:47:03,165
哈兰德先生,谢谢,很愉快的宴会
Herr Harlander, thank you. The party's delightful.

622
00:47:03,166 --> 00:47:06,416
希望我们没有打断你做研究
I hope we're not distracting you from your research

623
00:47:07,666 --> 00:47:09,833
害你要分心照顾我和伊莉莎白
to tend to me and Elizabeth.

624
00:47:11,583 --> 00:47:12,499
完全没有
Not at all.

625
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:16,041
她还年轻,可以依靠我们保护她
She's young. She can count on us to guard her.

626
00:47:19,791 --> 00:47:21,707
我就不打扰你了
I shall leave you your privacy.

627
00:47:21,708 --> 00:47:24,083
我们之间无需托辞
No need for subterfuge between us.

628
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:29,583
法国马桶,如厕时响起涓涓细流声
French porcelain, chimes to a man's stream.

629
00:47:31,166 --> 00:47:35,415
我快找到怎么进入淋巴系统的解方了
I am very near a solution, an access point to the lymphatic system.

630
00:47:35,416 --> 00:47:37,208
是啊,那件事
Ah, yeah, that.

631
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:39,291
已经过好久了
It's been so long.

632
00:47:41,583 --> 00:47:43,291
战事渐缓
The war is waning.

633
00:47:45,083 --> 00:47:47,207
我的资助会随战争而结束
And my funding will end with it.

634
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:49,749
你说过你会提供无限资助
You said your funds were unlimited.

635
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,166
可是我的耐心有限
My patience is not.

636
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:55,791
我收到可靠消息 一周内将爆发一场战役
I have it on good authority that a battle is to take place within a week.

637
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,999
战争狂潮会让我们渔翁得利
The tide of war will deliver its bounty to our shore.

638
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,499
战场?但是尸体会严重受损
A battlefield? The bodies will be mangled.

639
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,500
一周
One week.

640
00:48:05,166 --> 00:48:06,707
- 一周? - 一周后
- One week? - After that, history will pass us by.

641
00:48:06,708 --> 00:48:08,291
历史会弃我们而去

642
00:48:10,708 --> 00:48:13,125
男爵,帮我冲水好吗?
Flush that for me, will you, Baron?

643
00:48:15,583 --> 00:48:19,540
一周就要决定传送电流的方法
A week to determine how to deliver the current.

644
00:48:19,541 --> 00:48:20,458
根本做梦
Impossible.

645
00:48:21,625 --> 00:48:22,874
我该怎么办?
What would I do?

646
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:24,791
我知道我只差临门一脚
I was close. I could feel it.

647
00:48:25,625 --> 00:48:29,541
然后...人生从中作梗
And then...
life got in the way.

648
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,916
牠很想念你
Oh.
I believe she missed you.

649
00:48:35,416 --> 00:48:37,790
我得警告你,我一直在进行解剖研究
I must warn you, Elizabeth,

650
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:39,083
美极了
- I've been working on a dissection. - It's beautiful.

651
00:48:41,916 --> 00:48:43,000
你有吓到吗?
Does it shock you?

652
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:46,291
这让我想起了殉道画
Reminds me of martyrdom paintings.

653
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:50,666
痛苦消逝
Pain is gone.

654
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:55,416
神的巧思展现在对称和形体中
You can see God's design in the symmetry and the shapes.

655
00:48:57,833 --> 00:48:58,791
伊莉莎白
Elizabeth.

656
00:49:00,833 --> 00:49:02,625
我得对你坦白一件事
I must confess something to you.

657
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:07,625
我和你都相信惊奇事物
I have a belief in the marvelous and so do you.

658
00:49:09,666 --> 00:49:12,040
我们心灵相系,你是否感同身受?
There is a bond between us. Can you feel it?

659
00:49:12,041 --> 00:49:16,083
那连结几乎具体可见 我深信那另有所指
An almost physical one. I truly believe it to be something else.

660
00:49:24,083 --> 00:49:26,958
相信不代表是事实
Believing something does not make it true.

661
00:49:30,416 --> 00:49:31,625
那你为什么来这里?
Then why are you here?

662
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:41,291
牠是个美丽的生物,对吧?
Beautiful creature, is she not?

663
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:47,625
脱俗、迷人至极,却又如此奇特
Remote. Entirely bewitching, but so odd.

664
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:54,208
牠有三颗心脏
Three hearts.

665
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:57,166
复眼、白色血液
Multiple eyes. White blood.

666
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:01,416
妙的是,牠毫无选择
And a fascinating lack of choice.

667
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:03,125
我不懂
I don't understand.

668
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,375
选择是灵魂的所在
Choice is the seat of the soul.

669
00:50:09,083 --> 00:50:11,000
神赐给我们的礼物
The one gift God granted us.

670
00:50:16,166 --> 00:50:17,250
伊莉莎白...
Elizabeth...

671
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:22,957
我已作出抉择
I have chosen.

672
00:50:22,958 --> 00:50:24,125
晚安
Good night.

673
00:50:30,833 --> 00:50:31,791
伊莉莎白!
Elizabeth!

674
00:50:35,041 --> 00:50:36,333
伊莉莎白!
Elizabeth!

675
00:50:40,376 --> 00:50:41,750
我以为我失败了
I thought I had failed.

676
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:44,482
我以为彻底结束了
I thought it was entirely over. 

677
00:50:44,482 --> 00:50:45,186
我以为...
I thought...

678
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:47,757
我以为...
And I thought...

679
00:50:49,208 --> 00:50:49,933
我...
And I...

680
00:50:51,056 --> 00:50:52,080
对称
The symmetry.

681
00:50:58,719 --> 00:50:59,889
神的对称
God's symmetry. 

682
00:50:59,889 --> 00:51:00,794
我想通了
Yes, yes.

683
00:51:14,166 --> 00:51:14,760
这就对了
Yes.

684
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:31,625
把电池放在淋巴系统上
Placing the battery above the lymphatic system.

685
00:51:32,162 --> 00:51:33,873
我找到关键了
I had found the key.

686
00:51:34,534 --> 00:51:36,582
这下什么都阻止不了我
Nothing could stop me now.

687
00:51:38,605 --> 00:51:39,437
势不可挡
Nothing.

688
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,381
不行
No! 

689
00:51:43,381 --> 00:51:44,683
除非我有标示
No, do not take any bodies

690
00:51:44,683 --> 00:51:47,672
否则别搬最上层或底部的尸体
from the top or the bottom of the pile unless I mark them.

691
00:51:48,013 --> 00:51:50,250
组织可能冻坏或腐败了
Ice or rot may have destroyed the tissue.

692
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,208
找中间的尸体就好
Look only in the middle.

693
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,711
不缩小范围
Abundance can be disorienting 

694
00:52:00,711 --> 00:52:02,690
根本无从找起
unless one hones one's aim.

695
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:04,473
我喜欢个头高的样本
I'm favoring tall specimens, 

696
00:52:04,473 --> 00:52:05,626
四肢要长
long limbs.

697
00:52:05,626 --> 00:52:07,416
大块头进行起来更容易
Scale will make the work easier.

698
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:08,375
我喜欢
I like that.

699
00:52:10,321 --> 00:52:11,153
很好
Perfection.

700
00:52:12,416 --> 00:52:13,170
有何不可呢
And why not, 

701
00:52:13,551 --> 00:52:14,333
亲爱的男爵
dear Baron?

702
00:52:15,875 --> 00:52:17,079
确实 有何不可
Indeed, why not?

703
00:52:17,618 --> 00:52:19,416
找一颗完整的头颅
Look for a head that's intact.

704
00:52:20,916 --> 00:52:21,875
把那具搬上车
Put that one in the cart.

705
00:52:27,208 --> 00:52:28,416
把那具放在那里
Set that one over there.

706
00:52:28,916 --> 00:52:29,958
把其他的搬进来
Bring the others.

707
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,916
老天
Oh, good God.

708
00:53:50,872 --> 00:53:51,626
让一让好吗?
Do you mind?

709
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:20,572
完成了
It is finished.

710
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:06,833
哈兰德先生!
Herr Harlander!

711
00:56:07,958 --> 00:56:09,250
风暴要来了!
A storm is coming!

712
00:56:12,166 --> 00:56:13,000
我的手杖
My cane.

713
00:56:14,541 --> 00:56:15,707
我的手杖!
My cane!

714
00:56:15,708 --> 00:56:17,125
放在我手杖的把手里面
My cane, in the handle.

715
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:28,124
是水银
Mercury.

716
00:56:28,125 --> 00:56:29,875
- 你生病了吗? - 谢谢
- Are you ill? - Thank you.

717
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:42,875
那是...梅毒吗?
Is it... syphilis?

718
00:56:45,541 --> 00:56:46,708
对,我快死了
Yeah, I'm dying.

719
00:56:48,833 --> 00:56:51,832
同维纳斯春风一夜,和水银厮守一生
One night with Venus, a lifetime with Mercury.

720
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:52,958
俗语是这么说的吧?
Isn't that the phrase?

721
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:54,749
你是第几期?
What stage?

722
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:55,665
第二期?
Secondary?

723
00:56:55,666 --> 00:56:58,124
我俩都知道确切的病程
We both know the precise schedule.

724
00:56:58,125 --> 00:57:00,665
它开始啃食我的骨头
It starts to eat away my bones,

725
00:57:00,666 --> 00:57:06,374
眼眶、脸颊、牙齿、下巴、头颅 暴露出我的大脑
orbital, cheek, teeth, jaw, skull, exposing my brain.

726
00:57:06,375 --> 00:57:10,208
肿瘤、发狂、痛不欲生
Tumors, madness, excruciating pain.

727
00:57:11,416 --> 00:57:16,083
有天早上,我会开始尖叫,停不下来
One fine morning,
I will start to scream and I will never stop.

728
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:20,415
我难以面对如此下流的死法
I cannot face such a vulgar demise.

729
00:57:20,416 --> 00:57:23,124
所以我得提起那个条件
Which brings me to my one condition.

730
00:57:23,125 --> 00:57:27,249
我们有约定,你要报答我
Our deal. As agreed, in exchange

731
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:30,125
不枉费我对你的慷慨解囊
for my generous intervention on your behalf.

732
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:35,249
既然我们要给予新亚当生命
And as we give life to our new Adam,

733
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:38,166
我想被放进那具完美的新身体中
I want to be placed in this new perfect body.

734
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:41,541
不行
No.

735
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:44,999
- 不行 - 当然可以
- No, no. - Yes.

736
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,874
现在不行
Not now. Not now!

737
00:57:46,875 --> 00:57:49,874
- 就是要现在 - 以后再说,现在不行
- Precisely now. - We'll talk about this after, not now.

738
00:57:49,875 --> 00:57:51,208
没有以后了!
There is no after!

739
00:57:52,875 --> 00:57:54,250
没有以后了
There is no after.

740
00:58:40,041 --> 00:58:42,082
你要的我都给你了!
I gave you everything you wanted!

741
00:58:42,083 --> 00:58:44,332
你要什么,我都会照办
I give you everything you ask for.

742
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:46,041
你说得出,我就办得到
Name it, it's yours.

743
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,125
连伊莉莎白也可以
Even Elizabeth.

744
00:58:50,333 --> 00:58:51,333
拜托你
Please.

745
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:53,750
礼多人不怪嘛
"Please" always helps.

746
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:57,582
这个恶疾已蔓延到你全身
The disease has spread all inside of you.

747
00:58:57,583 --> 00:58:59,707
这是全面性的,你心知肚明
It's systemic, and you know it.

748
00:58:59,708 --> 00:59:01,749
你的器官都受到污染了
Every organ in you is polluted.

749
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:03,874
你的大脑、血液,都被污染了
Your brain, your blood, it's all polluted.

750
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:05,374
但我的钱没有,是这样吗?
But my money's not, is that it?

751
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,583
想都别想
It's impossible.

752
00:59:09,416 --> 00:59:12,333
你现在只需要说一个字
Now, all you need to say is one simple word.

753
00:59:12,833 --> 00:59:14,540
「好」,不多不少
"Yes," no more and no less.

754
00:59:14,541 --> 00:59:16,958
不行!你懂吗?不行!
No! Do you understand? No!

755
00:59:28,333 --> 00:59:29,458
你要做什么?
What are you doing?

756
00:59:30,208 --> 00:59:31,415
住手!
Stop!

757
00:59:31,416 --> 00:59:32,540
住手
Stop.

758
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:34,915
少了那个就前功尽弃了,这样是双输
If we lose that, we have nothing. We both lose.

759
00:59:34,916 --> 00:59:37,665
我会是啃食你肝脏的老鹰!
I will be the eagle that feasts on your liver!

760
00:59:37,666 --> 00:59:38,999
拜托,住手
Please, stop!

761
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,375
哈兰德先生
Herr Harlander. Herr Harlander!

762
00:59:50,083 --> 00:59:51,333
撑着点,看着我!
Hold on, look at me!

763
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:56,416
不要!哈兰德先生!
No! Herr Harlander!

764
01:00:32,958 --> 01:00:35,070
不 不 不
No, no. No!

765
01:02:06,833 --> 01:02:07,652
不 不 不
No, no, no!

766
01:02:08,734 --> 01:02:09,188
不
No!

767
01:02:24,333 --> 01:02:28,779
不 不 不
No! No! No!

768
01:02:38,541 --> 01:02:40,083
你骗我
You lied to me.

769
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:43,416
你说谎
You lied.

770
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:52,250
维多!
Victor!

771
01:02:53,791 --> 01:02:54,625
维多!
Victor!

772
01:03:33,861 --> 01:03:34,688
不要过来
No, please.

773
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:01,782
你看
Look. 

774
01:04:02,479 --> 01:04:03,333
一模一样
Same.

775
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:14,776
太阳
Sun.

776
01:04:16,083 --> 01:04:16,885
太阳
Sun. 

777
01:04:16,885 --> 01:04:17,489
光线
Light.

778
01:04:20,353 --> 01:04:21,121
面对它
Face it.

779
01:04:22,078 --> 01:04:23,168
阳光
Sunlight. 

780
01:04:23,168 --> 01:04:24,064
太阳是...
The sun is...

781
01:04:24,458 --> 01:04:25,707
太阳是生命
The sun is life.

782
01:04:28,177 --> 01:04:29,334
温暖
Ah, the warmth.

783
01:04:30,625 --> 01:04:32,375
对 没错
Yes! Yes.

784
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:43,000
维多
Victor.

785
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:45,916
维多
Victor.

786
01:04:49,791 --> 01:04:50,581
维多
Victor.

787
01:04:50,581 --> 01:04:51,375
没错
Yes.

788
01:04:52,166 --> 01:04:54,533
没错...你当然是
Yes, yes, yes. Of course you are.

789
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:56,380
你当然是
Of course you are.

790
01:05:02,083 --> 01:05:03,708
维多
Victor.

791
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:11,583
有来信,主人
The mail, sir.

792
01:05:12,125 --> 01:05:13,957
是老家稍来的信
Letters from the old estate.

793
01:05:13,958 --> 01:05:15,083
日内瓦
Geneva.

794
01:05:15,916 --> 01:05:17,958
- 我伯父有来信吗? - 没有
- Is there anything from my uncle? - No.

795
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:24,875
也许我们该去探访他们
Perhaps we should pay them a visit.

796
01:05:28,416 --> 01:05:30,166
小心走,你看,往下看
Careful. Look. Look down.

797
01:05:32,416 --> 01:05:34,583
水
Water. Water.

798
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,290
水
Water.

799
01:05:38,291 --> 01:05:39,582
没错,水
Yes, water.

800
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:41,124
- 维多 - 不对,我才是维多
- Victor. - No, I'm Victor.

801
01:05:41,125 --> 01:05:42,582
那是水,你来
That's water. Come here.

802
01:05:42,583 --> 01:05:44,415
- 维多 - 过来,来,好,很好
- Victor. - Come now, come. All right, good.

803
01:05:44,416 --> 01:05:46,124
我们要跨一大步
We're going to take a big step.

804
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:47,457
一起做,好了吗?
We'll do it together. Ready?

805
01:05:47,458 --> 01:05:49,291
- 跨到这边,像这样 - 维多
This way, like this.

806
01:05:49,958 --> 01:05:52,499
不是那样,走这边
No, not like that. This way.

807
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,665
不行,很烫
Oh, no, no, no. Hot, hot.

808
01:05:54,666 --> 01:05:56,332
不要碰,千万别碰
No, don't touch. Don't touch that.

809
01:05:56,333 --> 01:05:57,375
这很烫
It's hot.

810
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:07,250
坐下,非常好,没错
Sit. Very good. Very good. Yes.

811
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:10,999
好了,看看我有什么
Yes. Now, look what I have here.

812
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,832
你看,这是什么东西?
Look at this. What is this thing?

813
01:06:12,833 --> 01:06:15,250
这什么怪东西?小心
What is this strange thing? Careful.

814
01:06:16,375 --> 01:06:17,374
你力气很大
You're very strong.

815
01:06:17,375 --> 01:06:19,625
对,就像这样
Yes. And like this. Huh?

816
01:06:20,916 --> 01:06:24,499
对,另一手要吗?对,这个铐这里
Yes, you want another? Yes, this one goes right here.

817
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:25,458
钥匙
Key.

818
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:27,625
维多
Victor.

819
01:06:30,291 --> 01:06:32,249
这会让你很暖和
This will keep you nice and warm.

820
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:34,540
保暖的舒适毛毯
Nice blanket to keep you warm.

821
01:06:34,541 --> 01:06:36,124
维多
- Victor. - All right.

822
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:37,458
好了

823
01:06:38,583 --> 01:06:39,500
你留下
You stay.

824
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:42,000
你现在待在这里
You stay here now.

825
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:45,833
待在这里
Stay here now.

826
01:06:46,833 --> 01:06:48,916
我会回来,好了,别乱跑
I'll be back. All right. Stay there.

827
01:06:51,291 --> 01:06:52,333
维多
Victor.

828
01:06:53,375 --> 01:06:56,458
不行...没事的
No, no, no, no, no. It's all right.

829
01:06:57,166 --> 01:06:58,166
我会回来的
I'll come back.

830
01:07:05,333 --> 01:07:06,375
维多
Victor.

831
01:07:07,583 --> 01:07:08,458
维多

832
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:11,833
对他来说,一切都是新事物
Everything was new to him.

833
01:07:12,458 --> 01:07:16,708
温暖、寒冷、光线、黑暗
Warmth, cold, light, darkness.

834
01:07:17,583 --> 01:07:19,750
我在那里形塑他
And I was there to mold him.

835
01:07:21,083 --> 01:07:23,375
我从没想过创造后要做什么
I never considered what would come after creation.

836
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:27,041
在抵达地球尽头后
And having reached the edge of the earth,

837
01:07:28,125 --> 01:07:29,791
地平线亦不复见
there was no horizon left.

838
01:07:33,541 --> 01:07:35,916
这种成就让人觉得不太对劲
The achievement felt unnatural.

839
01:07:39,875 --> 01:07:42,041
缺乏意义
Void of meaning.

840
01:07:44,541 --> 01:07:46,333
我也深受其扰
And this troubled me so.

841
01:07:47,666 --> 01:07:50,165
你的船员,他们想回家
Your men, they wish to go back.

842
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:51,374
是吗?
Yes?

843
01:07:51,375 --> 01:07:52,333
大概吧
Probably.

844
01:07:54,708 --> 01:07:57,082
但等我们一脱困,就会扬帆前进
But the moment we're free, we're setting sails forwards.

845
01:07:57,083 --> 01:07:58,457
不惜一切代价
No matter the cost.

846
01:07:58,458 --> 01:08:00,041
你跟我一样疯狂
You share my madness.

847
01:08:02,916 --> 01:08:06,165
或许我跟你说这故事有其深意
Perhaps there is a finer point in me telling you my story.

848
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:08,333
不论有无深意,男爵
Whether there is or isn't, Baron...

849
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:12,208
我都想听
I'd like to hear it.

850
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:16,290
过了好几周
Weeks passed,

851
01:08:16,291 --> 01:08:20,624
他的体力迅速增强,而我每况愈下
and as his strength increased rapidly, mine waned.

852
01:08:20,625 --> 01:08:24,500
可惜他在语言或其他方面毫无进展
Alas, no further language or development occurred.

853
01:08:25,208 --> 01:08:26,916
不行...
No, no, no, no, no, no.

854
01:08:27,916 --> 01:08:30,540
低头...
Down, down, down, down.

855
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:31,957
好,这就对了
Yes, there we are.

856
01:08:31,958 --> 01:08:33,875
这就对了,别乱动,别动
There we are. Stay there. Stay.

857
01:08:37,208 --> 01:08:38,125
对,那是你
Yes, that's you.

858
01:08:38,916 --> 01:08:40,583
那是你,好吗?
That's you. All right?

859
01:08:46,708 --> 01:08:48,625
太好了,复原得很好
Oh, yes, this is healing rather nicely.

860
01:08:50,666 --> 01:08:51,750
我很累
I'm tired.

861
01:08:53,875 --> 01:08:55,333
我都没睡觉
I have not slept.

862
01:08:56,958 --> 01:09:01,415
完全没睡到一点觉
Not a winky-dinky-doo of sleep for me.

863
01:09:01,416 --> 01:09:03,125
都在照顾你
Tending to you.

864
01:09:03,916 --> 01:09:05,708
我帮你剃好了
I've finished shaving you.

865
01:09:10,666 --> 01:09:12,499
不行,住手
No, no, stop, stop.

866
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:14,790
放开,不行,张开
Let go. No, no, no, no, no, no. Open.

867
01:09:14,791 --> 01:09:17,541
把手张开,张开啊
Open your hand. Open. Open it.

868
01:09:21,125 --> 01:09:22,333
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

869
01:09:23,166 --> 01:09:24,665
你看,看你做的好事
Look. Look what you've done.

870
01:09:24,666 --> 01:09:27,541
你要听话,乖乖听话,我说放下
You have to listen to me. You have to listen. I said drop it.

871
01:09:28,541 --> 01:09:31,458
笨死了!不行,住手
Stupidity! No. Stop.

872
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:33,082
过来
Come here.

873
01:09:33,083 --> 01:09:35,624
- 维多 - 别碰我!
- Victor. - No, don't touch me!

874
01:09:35,625 --> 01:09:37,125
绝对不准碰我!
Don't ever touch me!

875
01:09:44,125 --> 01:09:44,958
过来
Come here.

876
01:09:46,166 --> 01:09:47,958
这不是我害的,是你自己弄的
I didn't do this. You did this.

877
01:09:53,208 --> 01:09:54,291
伤口
The wound.

878
01:09:55,541 --> 01:09:56,541
已经愈合了
It's closed.

879
01:09:57,125 --> 01:09:57,958
但怎么会这样?
But how?

880
01:10:01,875 --> 01:10:02,916
好的
All right.

881
01:10:06,208 --> 01:10:07,208
不行
No, no, no.

882
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:09,750
不行
No.

883
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:12,958
不行
No.

884
01:10:14,208 --> 01:10:16,958
好了
All right. All right.

885
01:10:23,791 --> 01:10:25,416
我确信一切都没事的
I'm sure everything's all right.

886
01:10:28,125 --> 01:10:29,625
我们快要到了
We'll be there soon enough.

887
01:10:31,875 --> 01:10:33,832
我知道你会思考,我知道
I know you have thoughts. I know.

888
01:10:33,833 --> 01:10:34,957
我就是知道
I know you do.

889
01:10:34,958 --> 01:10:37,583
你的体内某处蕴含着思想
Somewhere in there. Somewhere in there you have thoughts.

890
01:10:38,791 --> 01:10:39,791
对不对?
Hmm? Don't you?

891
01:10:40,458 --> 01:10:41,915
你有话想说吗?
Something you might want to say?

892
01:10:41,916 --> 01:10:43,875
颠三倒四、没人能懂也无所谓
However jumbled, however confused?

893
01:10:44,791 --> 01:10:45,625
有吗?
Hmm? Something?

894
01:10:46,416 --> 01:10:47,707
我是不是要求太高了?
Am I presuming too much?

895
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:48,665
维多
Victor.

896
01:10:48,666 --> 01:10:51,790
没错...
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

897
01:10:51,791 --> 01:10:53,749
这我们早就说过了
This much we have established.

898
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:56,040
那是我的名字,我叫维多
That is my name. My name is Victor.

899
01:10:56,041 --> 01:10:58,458
你会说点别的吗?究竟有没有?
Is there anything else that you can say? Anything at all? Hmm?

900
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:01,916
有吗?
Anything? Anything?

901
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:03,916
太阳
Um, sun, hmm?

902
01:11:04,791 --> 01:11:08,915
寒冷、雨水、血液,什么都好
Cold. Rain. Blood. Anything.

903
01:11:08,916 --> 01:11:10,958
靴子,你会说「靴子」吗?
Boot. Can you say "boot"?

904
01:11:11,833 --> 01:11:12,708
维多
Victor.

905
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:16,374
到底有完没完!
No, yes, no, yes! How about...

906
01:11:16,375 --> 01:11:17,415
那...

907
01:11:17,416 --> 01:11:19,249
那「手」呢?你会说「手」吗?
How about "hand"? Can you say "hand"?

908
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:21,250
手
Hand. Hand.

909
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,458
你在怕我吗?
Oh. Oh, oh. You are afraid of me?

910
01:11:28,625 --> 01:11:30,249
你怕我?
You're afraid of me?

911
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:32,624
为什么?你为什么会怕我?
Why? Why would you be afraid of me?

912
01:11:32,625 --> 01:11:34,083
我不会伤害你
I'm not going to hurt you.

913
01:11:34,875 --> 01:11:36,874
我不会伤害你,你是我制造的
I'm not going to hurt you. I made you.

914
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:38,791
我是你的制造者!别怕!
I'm your maker! Stop it!

915
01:11:56,458 --> 01:11:58,291
你们来了,你们真的来了
Oh.
You're here. You're really here.

916
01:11:59,166 --> 01:12:00,875
那来吧,快进来
Come on, then. Come, come.

917
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:03,207
我得告诉你
I have to tell you. I have so much to show you, Elizabeth.

918
01:12:03,208 --> 01:12:05,290
我有好多东西给你看,伊莉莎白

919
01:12:05,291 --> 01:12:06,790
很不可思议,保证惊奇
You won't believe it. It's absolutely marvelous.

920
01:12:06,791 --> 01:12:08,624
快来,先看我的笔记
Come, come, I'll show you my notes first.

921
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:10,166
我伯父在这里吗?
Is my uncle here?

922
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:11,875
什么?
What?

923
01:12:12,666 --> 01:12:13,874
我的伯父在不在?
My uncle, is he here?

924
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:14,833
不在
No, no.

925
01:12:15,375 --> 01:12:17,082
只有我在,他不在这里
No, I'm alone. He's not here.

926
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:19,707
- 他...他再过几天就回来了 - 你气色很差,维多
- He's... He'll be back in a few days. - You don't look very well, Victor.

927
01:12:19,708 --> 01:12:22,625
我好得很!从没这么清醒过!快来!
Oh, I've never felt better! I've never had a clearer mind! Come, come!

928
01:12:23,416 --> 01:12:24,625
你发烧了吗?
Are you running a fever?

929
01:12:25,333 --> 01:12:27,083
我只是见到你们太开心
I am just very excited to see you.

930
01:12:27,625 --> 01:12:29,874
我欣喜若狂,整个人精神都来了
I'm exalted. The spirits have lifted me so much.

931
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:32,000
保证惊奇,我早料到会这样
Absolutely marvelous...

932
01:12:32,791 --> 01:12:34,416
维多...
Victor...

933
01:12:36,208 --> 01:12:39,458
维多,请给我一点时间
Victor. Victor.

934
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:55,208
是谁伤害你?
Who hurt you?

935
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:57,500
我有东西给你看,威廉
I have to show you this, William.

936
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,124
我帮你整理好
Let me organize it for you.

937
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:02,375
我也有东西给你看
And I have something to show to you.

938
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:06,000
我跟皇家医学会谈过了
I've spoken to the Royal Medical Society.

939
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:09,208
- 他们很想见你一面 - 不行,时候未到
- They're interested in seeing you. - No, no, no, not yet.

940
01:15:09,958 --> 01:15:11,208
我还没准备好
I'm not quite ready yet.

941
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:14,416
我还以为那是你的心愿
I thought that's what you always wanted.

942
01:15:18,416 --> 01:15:19,541
那个人
The man.

943
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,208
- 楼下那个人 - 你看到他了?
- The man downstairs. - You saw him?

944
01:15:22,916 --> 01:15:25,166
他是病人吗?受害者?
Is he a patient? A victim?

945
01:15:27,083 --> 01:15:29,207
他的伤口,你把他打得遍体鳞伤
His wounds. You wounded him like that.

946
01:15:29,208 --> 01:15:31,999
不是我,伊莉莎白 是这个世界伤害他
No, no, no. It was the world that hurt him, Elizabeth.

947
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,833
我...我赋予他生命
I... I gave him life.

948
01:15:35,416 --> 01:15:36,625
我赋予他生命
I gave him life.

949
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,041
起来...
Up, up, up.

950
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:41,750
来吧
Come on.

951
01:15:44,166 --> 01:15:45,457
这里就好
There, there, there...

952
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:47,375
他还在适应周遭环境
He's still getting used to his surroundings.

953
01:15:51,125 --> 01:15:53,165
牠很强壮,威廉
It is strong, William.

954
01:15:53,166 --> 01:15:55,125
- 你成功了 - 牠非常强壮
- You did it. - It's so strong.

955
01:15:55,791 --> 01:15:56,750
你真的成功了
You did it.

956
01:15:57,333 --> 01:15:59,290
全身系统都运作正常
All its systems are functional.

957
01:15:59,291 --> 01:16:00,750
伤口都痊愈了
All healing.

958
01:16:01,583 --> 01:16:04,375
这种疗愈能力的确古怪
And the healing is erratic, yes.

959
01:16:05,083 --> 01:16:06,500
但是绝无仅有
But exceptional.

960
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:16,207
为什么他被锁在这里?
Why is he chained here?

961
01:16:16,208 --> 01:16:17,874
这是为了他和我的安全着想
For his own safety and for mine,

962
01:16:17,875 --> 01:16:21,624
也比较容易清洁和管理
and it's easy to clean and, uh, maintain it.

963
01:16:21,625 --> 01:16:23,125
牠什么都不懂
And it doesn't know any better.

964
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:25,500
可是你懂
But you do.

965
01:16:28,708 --> 01:16:29,916
哈兰德知情吗?
Does Harlander know?

966
01:16:32,375 --> 01:16:34,999
我们得做好万全准备等他回来...
We have to prepare everything for the moment he returns.

967
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,458
- 那当然 - ...让一切上得了台面
- Of course. - And have everything presentable.

968
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:42,666
牠有智慧吗?
Is it intelligent?

969
01:16:46,416 --> 01:16:48,166
维多,牠有智慧吗?
Victor, is it intelligent?

970
01:17:02,625 --> 01:17:05,250
我搞不清楚你到底是怎么办到的
I can't fathom how exactly you did what you did,

971
01:17:05,833 --> 01:17:07,750
但我知道这件事意义非凡
but its dimension does not escape me.

972
01:17:10,291 --> 01:17:14,000
维多,你可曾问过自己
Victor, did you ever ask yourself,

973
01:17:15,041 --> 01:17:16,916
组成那个人的所有部分中
of all the parts that make that man,

974
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:19,916
灵魂位在哪里?
which one holds the soul?

975
01:17:26,458 --> 01:17:27,958
我没问过
No, I didn't.

976
01:17:28,916 --> 01:17:32,375
楼下那怪物叫人惶惶不安
There's something so disquieting about that creature down there.

977
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:36,541
样貌扭曲,犹如哈哈镜中 有人探头探脑的倒影
Askew, like a figure peeking around a funhouse mirror.

978
01:17:37,208 --> 01:17:38,125
但牠是活物
But animated.

979
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:40,375
是什么让牠活起来的?
Animated by what?

980
01:18:45,416 --> 01:18:46,416
会不会痛?
Does it hurt?

981
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:55,458
树叶?
A leaf?

982
01:18:55,958 --> 01:18:56,958
给我的?
For me?

983
01:18:57,833 --> 01:18:58,958
谢谢
Thank you.

984
01:19:03,041 --> 01:19:04,375
好美喔
Isn't it beautiful?

985
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:06,833
这要送我的吗?
This is for me?

986
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:09,666
我是伊莉莎白
I'm Elizabeth.

987
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:13,125
你会说「伊莉莎白」吗?
Can you say "Elizabeth"?

988
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:15,416
伊莉莎白
Elizabeth.

989
01:19:16,625 --> 01:19:18,875
用喉咙发出声音
My throat makes sounds.

990
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:20,833
伊莉莎白
Elizabeth.

991
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:38,916
我要走了
I'm going to go now.

992
01:19:53,625 --> 01:19:56,916
伊莉...莎白
Eliza... beth.

993
01:19:58,833 --> 01:20:00,583
你不应该靠近牠
You should not go near it.

994
01:20:02,666 --> 01:20:03,541
「牠」?
"It"?

995
01:20:05,625 --> 01:20:07,333
牠,没错
It. Yes.

996
01:20:08,166 --> 01:20:12,374
我想牠的体内有生命 但没有智慧的火花
I believe there is life in it,
but not the spark of intelligence that I had intended.

997
01:20:12,375 --> 01:20:13,457
事与愿违

998
01:20:13,458 --> 01:20:15,165
也许不是你所理解的那种
Perhaps not as you understand it.

999
01:20:15,166 --> 01:20:16,874
有地方出了差错
Something went wrong.

1000
01:20:16,875 --> 01:20:19,374
阻塞物、缝合处、连结点
A blockage, a suture, a connection.

1001
01:20:19,375 --> 01:20:21,957
你,伟大的维多弗兰肯斯坦会犯错?
You, the great Victor Frankenstein, you made a mistake?

1002
01:20:21,958 --> 01:20:24,249
怪物只会说一个词,就一个
The Creature knows but one word, and one word alone.

1003
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:27,165
「维多...」
"Victor, Victor, Victor, Victor."

1004
01:20:27,166 --> 01:20:28,832
毫无韵律或理由地不断重复
It just parrots it without rhyme or reason.

1005
01:20:28,833 --> 01:20:32,082
对他而言,也许那个词暂时代表一切
Perhaps for the time being that word means everything to him.

1006
01:20:32,083 --> 01:20:35,415
或许重生使他复活的灵魂更单纯
What if in being anew, the spirit that animates him is simpler,

1007
01:20:35,416 --> 01:20:36,540
- 更纯粹... - 纯粹?
- purer-- - Purer?

1008
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:38,541
比普通人更纯粹?
Purer than that of the common man?

1009
01:20:43,291 --> 01:20:44,874
说不定是不受原罪束缚的造物主
What if, unrestrained by sin,

1010
01:20:44,875 --> 01:20:47,874
把气息直接吹进受伤的肉体?
our creator's breath came into its wounded flesh directly?

1011
01:20:47,875 --> 01:20:49,958
老天爷,伊莉莎白
Good God, Elizabeth.

1012
01:20:51,916 --> 01:20:53,957
若要硬逼我自己相信这番话
If I could force myself to believe it,

1013
01:20:53,958 --> 01:20:58,124
我会不禁认为,你对那东西有好感
it would be my inclination to see attraction in you for that thing.

1014
01:20:58,125 --> 01:20:59,625
这是同理心
Understanding.

1015
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:01,832
我在那对眼眸中看见痛苦
In those eyes I saw pain,

1016
01:21:01,833 --> 01:21:04,040
若痛苦不是智慧的证明 不然是什么?
and what is pain if not evidence of intelligence?

1017
01:21:04,041 --> 01:21:05,665
那我的痛苦呢?
What about my pain?

1018
01:21:05,666 --> 01:21:07,291
你拒绝我的情意呢?
What about what you have denied me?

1019
01:21:09,041 --> 01:21:10,625
我心的渴望...
What my heart wants...

1020
01:21:11,875 --> 01:21:12,916
你的心?
Your heart?

1021
01:21:16,333 --> 01:21:17,790
在人体解剖学中
Of all the human anatomy,

1022
01:21:17,791 --> 01:21:20,416
那是你最不了解的器官
that is the organ furthest from your understanding.

1023
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:23,208
唯有怪物妄想操控生命,男爵
Only monsters play God, Baron.

1024
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:31,250
你比普通人更纯粹?
Purer than the common man, hmm?

1025
01:21:36,458 --> 01:21:38,625
而我莫名其妙成了坏人
And I, somehow, the villain. Mm-hmm.

1026
01:21:40,791 --> 01:21:42,625
你的心很纯粹?
Your heart is pure?

1027
01:21:43,333 --> 01:21:45,290
绝对没有
I assure you it isn't.

1028
01:21:45,291 --> 01:21:47,208
我最清楚,因为那是我放的
I should know. I put it there.

1029
01:21:48,125 --> 01:21:48,958
上去
Up.

1030
01:21:59,833 --> 01:22:01,000
再试一次
Let us try again.

1031
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:05,333
现在把腿伸出来
Now give me your leg.

1032
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:07,333
腿!
Leg!

1033
01:22:08,458 --> 01:22:09,458
把腿伸出来!
Give me your leg!

1034
01:22:10,416 --> 01:22:12,833
痛苦是智慧的证明,对吧?
Pain is evidence of intelligence, is it not?

1035
01:22:13,416 --> 01:22:14,958
那就来检验这个理论
Well, let's test the theory.

1036
01:22:15,708 --> 01:22:17,541
把腿伸出来!
Give me your leg!

1037
01:22:18,541 --> 01:22:19,458
腿!
Leg!

1038
01:22:20,208 --> 01:22:21,249
腿!
Leg!

1039
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:22,333
快点!
Come on!

1040
01:22:23,041 --> 01:22:24,250
伸出来,野兽!
Give it to me, you beast!

1041
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:28,333
把腿伸出来!
Give me your leg!

1042
01:22:30,291 --> 01:22:31,291
腿!
Leg!

1043
01:22:34,666 --> 01:22:36,125
维多!
Victor!

1044
01:22:37,333 --> 01:22:39,041
维多!
Victor!

1045
01:22:41,416 --> 01:22:46,333
维多!
Victor! Victor!

1046
01:22:46,958 --> 01:22:48,000
维多,什么事?
What is it, Victor?

1047
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:50,333
过来
Come. Come.

1048
01:22:51,625 --> 01:22:54,000
我失败了,我铸下大错
I failed. I made a mistake.

1049
01:22:54,708 --> 01:22:56,874
- 你没失败,我看过你的报告 - 我有
- No, you didn't fail. I saw your papers. - I did.

1050
01:22:56,875 --> 01:22:58,832
- 牠很完美 - 那怪物危险至极
- It's perfect. - The Creature is extremely dangerous.

1051
01:22:58,833 --> 01:23:00,666
没有...维多
There's not... Victor.

1052
01:23:01,375 --> 01:23:02,999
等哈兰德到了之后一起讨论
Let's wait for Harlander and discuss together.

1053
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,583
威廉,有件事应该让你知道
William, there is something you should know.

1054
01:23:06,333 --> 01:23:07,666
我得让你看一个东西
Something I have to show you.

1055
01:23:13,583 --> 01:23:16,416
- 哈兰德... - 他一怒之下杀了哈兰德
- Ha-- Harlander... - In a fit of rage, he killed him.

1056
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:25,916
你现在知道我为何犹豫不说了吗?
Do you understand now why I was hesitant to share this with you?

1057
01:23:26,541 --> 01:23:28,250
而且绝对不能告诉伊莉莎白
And certainly not with Elizabeth.

1058
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:33,541
那现在该怎么办?
S... So what's to be done now?

1059
01:23:34,166 --> 01:23:34,999
什么?
What?

1060
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,707
- 接着怎么办? -「接着怎么办」?
- What's to be done? - "What's to be done"?

1061
01:23:36,708 --> 01:23:38,874
你必须带伊莉莎白返回维也纳
You must take Elizabeth back to Vienna.

1062
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:41,832
就说有急事,你们得即刻启程
Tell her something urgent came up and you have to leave immediately.

1063
01:23:41,833 --> 01:23:43,291
一定要瞒着她
Keep her in the dark.

1064
01:23:44,583 --> 01:23:45,583
这是为了保护她
For her own safety.

1065
01:23:46,166 --> 01:23:47,749
你得照我的话做
You have to do as I say.

1066
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:50,625
我们会尽快回来 但目前此举暂为上策
We'll be back in no time. But for now, this is for the best.

1067
01:23:51,708 --> 01:23:53,958
拜托你上马车吧
Now get in the carriage, please.

1068
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:08,625
你认为那怪物的寿命有多长?
The Creature, what's its lifespan, you think?

1069
01:24:09,958 --> 01:24:12,666
很短,肯定不久于世
Brief. Very brief, I'm sure.

1070
01:24:59,291 --> 01:25:01,250
我有很不安的预感
I have the most terrible feeling.

1071
01:25:05,208 --> 01:25:06,083
什么预感?
What is it?

1072
01:25:07,708 --> 01:25:09,000
请马车掉头回去
Turn the carriage around.

1073
01:25:10,125 --> 01:25:11,541
你自己去维也纳
You go to Vienna.

1074
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:15,791
叫马车掉头,不然我就跳车 维多会杀了他
Turn the carriage around or I will jump. He's going to kill him.

1075
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:26,625
说一个词
Say one word.

1076
01:25:27,166 --> 01:25:28,625
再说一个词,什么都行
One word more. Anything.

1077
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:30,625
让我饶你一命
Make me save you.

1078
01:25:35,958 --> 01:25:37,000
维多
- Victor. - Mm-hmm.

1079
01:25:44,958 --> 01:25:47,041
伊莉莎白
Elizabeth.

1080
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:31,708
维多!
Victor! Victor!

1081
01:26:36,708 --> 01:26:41,875
维多!
Victor!
Victor!

1082
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:33,957
但事情并未就此结束
But that was not the end of it.

1083
01:27:33,958 --> 01:27:37,291
我想寻求生命,却创造了死亡
In seeking life, I created death.

1084
01:27:43,375 --> 01:27:46,000
看来我得再劝劝我的船员
It would seem I need to address my men again.

1085
01:27:50,583 --> 01:27:51,416
放心吧
Don't worry.

1086
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:52,958
他们会听我的话
They'll listen to me.

1087
01:27:57,166 --> 01:28:00,874
不要,住手!别伤害他!我在这里
No, no, stop!
Do not harm him! I'm here.

1088
01:28:00,875 --> 01:28:02,250
抓我吧
Take me.

1089
01:28:02,916 --> 01:28:04,082
动手吧,野兽
Go on, beast.

1090
01:28:04,083 --> 01:28:08,041
杀了我俩,证明你制造者的故事无误
Kill us both. Confirm your maker's tale.

1091
01:28:13,541 --> 01:28:18,500
我的制造者...说了他的故事
My maker... told his tale.

1092
01:28:23,833 --> 01:28:26,708
那我也要说出我的故事
Then I will tell you mine.

1093
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:33,166
(第二部:怪物的故事)

1094
01:28:42,833 --> 01:28:48,415
维多!
Victor! Victor! Victor!

1095
01:28:48,416 --> 01:28:53,208
我叫你的名字,发现只有我一个人
I called your name and understood I was alone.

1096
01:32:52,833 --> 01:32:54,207
- 那是什么? - 射牠!
- What is that? - Shoot at it!

1097
01:32:54,208 --> 01:32:55,375
杀了牠!
Shoot it!

1098
01:33:01,083 --> 01:33:02,375
射中了吗?
Did you get it?

1099
01:33:03,958 --> 01:33:04,958
嘿!

1100
01:33:05,666 --> 01:33:06,875
牠跑去哪了?
Where is it?

1101
01:33:27,125 --> 01:33:29,041
我的伤口痊愈了
My wounds had healed.

1102
01:33:31,958 --> 01:33:36,125
可是我觉得冷,非常冷
But I felt cold, so cold.

1103
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:10,790
- 生个火吧 - 好
- Can you start the fire? - All right.

1104
01:35:10,791 --> 01:35:12,666
我会尽快把畜栏修好
And I'll repair the corral as soon as I can.

1105
01:35:19,625 --> 01:35:20,999
你们没事吧?杀掉牠了吗?
You all right, then? Did you get it?

1106
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,415
没有,到处都找遍了 就是找不到那个东西
Nah, we looked everywhere. Couldn't find that thing.

1107
01:35:23,416 --> 01:35:25,124
我们明明射中两次
Though we shot at it two times.

1108
01:35:25,125 --> 01:35:27,082
血迹到1.6公里外就消失了
Blood trail died about a mile from here.

1109
01:35:27,083 --> 01:35:29,250
好了,进来吧
All right. Come in. Come in.

1110
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,874
我们追踪了好一会儿
We followed it for a while and then it disappeared. Gone.

1111
01:35:31,875 --> 01:35:33,625
然后牠就消失得无影无踪

1112
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:36,082
那是什么?是熊吗?
What was it? Was it a bear?

1113
01:35:36,083 --> 01:35:38,374
不是熊,也不是人类
That was no bear or human. I've never seen anything like it.

1114
01:35:38,375 --> 01:35:39,665
我没见过那种东西

1115
01:35:39,666 --> 01:35:40,999
那是鬼吗?
Was it a ghost, then?

1116
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,332
不是,牠会流血,是血肉之躯
It was no ghost. We drew blood. It was flesh and bone.

1117
01:35:44,333 --> 01:35:45,832
来,来这里
Come, come. Over here.

1118
01:35:45,833 --> 01:35:47,165
继续说你看到什么
Tell me more about what you saw.

1119
01:35:47,166 --> 01:35:50,124
安娜玛丽亚,带爷爷去壁炉边
Anna-Maria, take your grandfather over by the fireplace.

1120
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:51,750
确保他感到舒适
Make sure he's comfortable.

1121
01:35:52,833 --> 01:35:54,166
这里,爷爷
Over here, Grandfather.

1122
01:35:56,458 --> 01:35:58,708
我们追到森林深处,怎么都找不到
We went deep into the forest. Couldn't find it.

1123
01:36:04,666 --> 01:36:06,040
我们会逮到牠的
We will get it.

1124
01:36:06,041 --> 01:36:07,708
- 要花点时间 - 对
- It'll take time. - Yeah.

1125
01:36:08,666 --> 01:36:10,832
安娜玛丽亚,过来
Anna-Maria, come.

1126
01:36:10,833 --> 01:36:12,875
过来,宝贝,来外面帮我忙
Come, love. Help me outside.

1127
01:36:23,541 --> 01:36:25,416
我被那个老人所打动
The old man moved me.

1128
01:36:29,833 --> 01:36:32,791
他失明的双眼充满智慧
And his unseeing eyes were full of wisdom.

1129
01:36:45,541 --> 01:36:47,791
这些人拥有一种声音
These people possessed a sound.

1130
01:36:49,125 --> 01:36:50,749
用来告诉彼此
Used it to tell each other

1131
01:36:50,750 --> 01:36:54,541
感受和想法
about feelings and ideas.

1132
01:36:56,208 --> 01:36:58,458
他们称之为词语
They called them words.

1133
01:37:01,750 --> 01:37:02,833
专心点
Pay attention.

1134
01:37:03,708 --> 01:37:04,625
这是什么?
What is this?

1135
01:37:05,208 --> 01:37:06,208
男生
A boy.

1136
01:37:07,458 --> 01:37:09,250
- 再说一次 - 男生
- And again. - A boy.

1137
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:11,541
非常好,孩子
Very good, my child.

1138
01:37:12,833 --> 01:37:13,915
那这个呢?
And this?

1139
01:37:13,916 --> 01:37:16,041
是...眼睛
An... An eye.

1140
01:37:16,833 --> 01:37:18,624
- 再说一次 - 眼睛
- And again. - An eye.

1141
01:37:18,625 --> 01:37:21,749
非常好,乖孙女
Yeah. Well done. Well done, my girl.

1142
01:37:21,750 --> 01:37:23,832
- 眼睛 - 这个呢?
- Eye. - And this one?

1143
01:37:23,833 --> 01:37:24,832
手
The hand.

1144
01:37:24,833 --> 01:37:26,750
- 非常好 - 手
- Very good. - Hand.

1145
01:37:27,791 --> 01:37:28,749
来帮个忙
Give us a hand.

1146
01:37:28,750 --> 01:37:31,207
拿绳子把后面最粗的那根绑起来
Tie a rope around the biggest one back there.

1147
01:37:31,208 --> 01:37:33,708
我向往加入这个家庭
I longed to be part of this family.

1148
01:37:34,375 --> 01:37:36,415
冬天来临前,家里需要更多引火柴
We'll need more kindling before the winter.

1149
01:37:36,416 --> 01:37:38,582
我们会出去张罗几趟
We'll take a few trips.

1150
01:37:38,583 --> 01:37:40,583
成为他们的帮手
To be their benefactor.

1151
01:37:41,166 --> 01:37:42,665
房屋需要更粗大的树干
We'll need larger trunks for the structure.

1152
01:37:42,666 --> 01:37:43,582
好
All right.

1153
01:37:43,583 --> 01:37:46,750
我究竟能为他们做什么?
What could I possibly do for them?

1154
01:37:52,333 --> 01:37:55,290
安娜玛丽亚!父亲!
Anna-Maria! Father!

1155
01:37:55,291 --> 01:37:57,625
来!快来看!
Come! Come and see!

1156
01:37:59,541 --> 01:38:01,207
你看,安娜玛丽亚!
Look, Anna-Maria!

1157
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:03,000
看啊,还有更多!快看!
Look, there's more! Look!

1158
01:38:05,083 --> 01:38:06,875
谁会这么好心?
Who could have done this?

1159
01:38:09,916 --> 01:38:11,708
是森林精灵
The Spirit of the Forest.

1160
01:38:13,333 --> 01:38:14,583
我们应该感谢他
We should thank him.

1161
01:38:16,333 --> 01:38:17,374
谢谢你
Thank you.

1162
01:38:17,375 --> 01:38:20,165
说「谢谢,森林精灵」
Say, "Thank you, Spirit of the Forest."

1163
01:38:20,166 --> 01:38:23,290
谢谢,森林精灵
Thank you. Thank you, Spirit of the Forest.

1164
01:38:23,291 --> 01:38:24,375
谢谢
Thank you.

1165
01:38:25,416 --> 01:38:27,125
过来,看这边
Come. Look over here.

1166
01:38:33,541 --> 01:38:34,583
谢谢
Thank you.

1167
01:38:36,666 --> 01:38:40,749
那一刻起,我成了他们无形的守护者
From then on, I became their invisible guardian.

1168
01:38:40,750 --> 01:38:43,957
森林精灵
The Spirit of the Forest.

1169
01:38:43,958 --> 01:38:49,333
他们偶尔也会对我聊表心意
And on occasion, they too extended a small kindness towards me.

1170
01:38:50,375 --> 01:38:52,583
衣物、面包
Clothes, bread.

1171
01:38:54,791 --> 01:38:56,291
有一段时间
And for a moment,

1172
01:38:57,375 --> 01:39:00,458
极其短暂的时间
a brief, brief moment,

1173
01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:03,583
我和世界和平共处
the world and I were at peace.

1174
01:39:11,750 --> 01:39:13,332
跟上去
Come along. Come along.

1175
01:39:13,333 --> 01:39:14,290
进去,没错
In you go. Yeah.

1176
01:39:14,291 --> 01:39:15,749
一定要关好栅门
Make sure you close that gate.

1177
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:17,624
谁会这么帮忙?
Who could have done this?

1178
01:39:17,625 --> 01:39:19,833
是森林精灵,对吧?
The Spirit of the Forest, eh?

1179
01:39:21,125 --> 01:39:22,125
交给我吧
I got it.

1180
01:39:24,125 --> 01:39:28,832
「最后,那名自傲的年轻人」
"And in the end, the proud young man

1181
01:39:28,833 --> 01:39:32,124
「再也找不到他失去的手」
could never find his missing hand."

1182
01:39:32,125 --> 01:39:36,374
「手化成石头,他财产没了」
"It turned to stone, his fortune gone,

1183
01:39:36,375 --> 01:39:40,041
「他失去自尊,还有土地」
and he lost his pride and lost his land."

1184
01:39:46,125 --> 01:39:48,207
非常好,亲爱的
Very good, my dear.

1185
01:39:48,208 --> 01:39:51,250
念得很好,换这本
Beautifully read. Now try this one.

1186
01:40:01,333 --> 01:40:02,458
是野狼
Wolves.

1187
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:48,750
有个想法
An idea,

1188
01:40:50,041 --> 01:40:52,333
有种感觉在我心中成形
a feeling became clear to me.

1189
01:40:54,958 --> 01:40:57,583
猎人并不痛恨野狼
The hunter did not hate the wolf.

1190
01:40:58,375 --> 01:41:00,750
野狼也不痛恨绵羊
The wolf did not hate the sheep.

1191
01:41:06,458 --> 01:41:09,666
但三者间似乎必然会发生暴力
But violence felt inevitable between them.

1192
01:41:10,375 --> 01:41:15,583
我心想:「也许这就是世道吧」
Perhaps, I thought, this was the way of the world.

1193
01:41:16,708 --> 01:41:20,375
你会被追捕和杀害
It would hunt you and kill you

1194
01:41:21,125 --> 01:41:23,791
单纯是因为你的身分
just for being who you are.

1195
01:41:26,250 --> 01:41:28,583
我们月底要去卖绵羊,父亲
The sheep will be sold by the end of the month, Father.

1196
01:41:29,291 --> 01:41:31,958
到时我会带你、艾玛 和安娜玛丽亚一起进城
Then I'll take you, Alma and Anna-Maria into town.

1197
01:41:32,750 --> 01:41:33,874
我们会进入山区
We'll go into the mountains,

1198
01:41:33,875 --> 01:41:36,040
猎杀野狼,在冬天结束时返回
hunt the wolves and be back at the end of winter.

1199
01:41:36,041 --> 01:41:38,915
我冬天都在此独居祈祷
I pray here alone every winter and this year will be no different.

1200
01:41:38,916 --> 01:41:41,082
今年也不例外

1201
01:41:41,083 --> 01:41:43,874
求求你,父亲,明理一点
Please, Father, listen to reason.

1202
01:41:43,875 --> 01:41:47,375
你们就忙你们的,我也是
You do what you must and so will I.

1203
01:41:51,208 --> 01:41:52,541
你这个老顽固
You stubborn old goat.

1204
01:41:55,291 --> 01:41:57,666
现在只有我和你了,精灵
It's just you and I now, Spirit.

1205
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:00,000
只有我和你了
Just you and I.

1206
01:42:00,625 --> 01:42:05,249
我脑海中想像过许许多多种
And I had formed in my imagination many ways

1207
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:08,000
在老人面前现身的方式
I would present myself to the old man.

1208
01:42:09,666 --> 01:42:11,041
他会怕我吗?
Would he fear me?

1209
01:42:12,458 --> 01:42:13,625
欢迎我?
Welcome me?

1210
01:42:15,083 --> 01:42:16,291
还是下逐客令?
Turn me away?

1211
01:42:23,791 --> 01:42:25,250
谁在那里?
Who goes there?

1212
01:42:30,958 --> 01:42:35,083
往前一步,我踏进了不同的世界
With a single step, I entered a different world.

1213
01:42:36,416 --> 01:42:38,958
我以前只能远远看着
One I had only seen from afar.

1214
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:42,958
请问你是谁?
Please, who is it?

1215
01:42:43,583 --> 01:42:44,583
回答我
Answer me.

1216
01:42:45,958 --> 01:42:46,833
告诉我
Tell me.

1217
01:42:47,458 --> 01:42:48,958
你为何会来这里?
Why are you here?

1218
01:42:51,416 --> 01:42:52,250
旅行
Travel.

1219
01:42:52,833 --> 01:42:54,625
欢迎你,亲爱的旅人
Welcome, dear traveler.

1220
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:58,290
我很感激你的陪伴
Do not think me ungrateful for the company if I ask you to procure a chair.

1221
01:42:58,291 --> 01:43:01,457
只是你得自己找椅子坐

1222
01:43:01,458 --> 01:43:06,415
我当不了称职的主人
I... I find it difficult being a good host.

1223
01:43:06,416 --> 01:43:11,041
没错,因为我看不见
Yes.
My... My sight has failed me.

1224
01:43:12,708 --> 01:43:16,707
不过桌上有面包和白兰地
But there is bread and brandy on the table.

1225
01:43:16,708 --> 01:43:17,916
请自行取用
Pray help yourself.

1226
01:43:20,125 --> 01:43:21,833
白兰...地?
Bran... dy?

1227
01:43:23,208 --> 01:43:24,957
你的语言
Your language.

1228
01:43:24,958 --> 01:43:28,832
你讲得不太流利
You have a hard time speaking it.

1229
01:43:28,833 --> 01:43:31,000
你不是本地人吗?
Are you not from these parts?

1230
01:43:36,750 --> 01:43:37,750
你在害怕吗?
Are you afraid?

1231
01:43:39,750 --> 01:43:41,000
不用怕
No need to be.

1232
01:43:45,916 --> 01:43:47,541
你在怕什么?
What are you afraid of?

1233
01:43:48,291 --> 01:43:49,333
什么都怕
- Everything. - Your...

1234
01:43:50,833 --> 01:43:53,749
你的手好冰
Your hands are frozen

1235
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:57,499
而且还受伤了,对吧?
and you've been hurt, have you not?

1236
01:43:57,500 --> 01:43:58,457
受伤?
Hurt?

1237
01:43:58,458 --> 01:44:05,290
对,你的手和脸上都有伤疤
Yes. Your hands and face have scars

1238
01:44:05,291 --> 01:44:06,833
而且你身穿制服
and you are wearing uniform.

1239
01:44:07,458 --> 01:44:09,291
你在打仗时受伤吗?
Were you injured in battle?

1240
01:44:11,833 --> 01:44:13,000
你之前都躲在
You were hiding

1241
01:44:14,125 --> 01:44:16,541
磨坊齿轮房,对吧?
in the mill gears, were you not?

1242
01:44:21,125 --> 01:44:24,207
我就知道,森林精灵
Ah!
Yeah. Yeah. The Spirit of the Forest.

1243
01:44:24,208 --> 01:44:25,208
是的
Yes.

1244
01:44:26,083 --> 01:44:28,541
虽然我看不见你的模样
I cannot judge of your countenance,

1245
01:44:29,375 --> 01:44:31,665
但你的声音中有股特质
but there is something in your voice

1246
01:44:31,666 --> 01:44:36,082
让我相信你善良又仁慈
which persuades me of your goodwill and kindness.

1247
01:44:36,083 --> 01:44:37,125
仁慈?
- Kindness? - Mm.

1248
01:44:39,666 --> 01:44:41,750
留下来陪我
Stay with me.

1249
01:44:43,083 --> 01:44:46,082
跟我一起用餐和取暖
Share my food and fire.

1250
01:44:46,083 --> 01:44:50,040
我很乐意跟你分享我微薄的物资
I would be delighted to share what little I have with you

1251
01:44:50,041 --> 01:44:53,541
也会很高兴有你相伴
and would be greatly helped by your companionship.

1252
01:44:54,375 --> 01:44:57,874
而且你可以念书给我听
And you... you could read to me.

1253
01:44:57,875 --> 01:44:59,000
念书?
- Read? - Mm.

1254
01:45:00,166 --> 01:45:05,916
把这里当自己家,把我当成你的朋友
Make this your home and I your friend.

1255
01:45:07,583 --> 01:45:08,458
朋友
Friend.

1256
01:45:13,916 --> 01:45:14,916
朋友
Friend.

1257
01:45:23,375 --> 01:45:24,208
朋友
Friends.

1258
01:45:25,625 --> 01:45:29,750
我就是在那时读到第一个故事
And it was then that I read my first story,

1259
01:45:30,666 --> 01:45:33,333
那是开天辟地的第一个故事
and it was the first story.

1260
01:45:34,416 --> 01:45:39,541
我读到男人亚当和女人夏娃
I read about a man named Adam and a woman named Eve,

1261
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:44,415
他们在第一个园子的时光
about their time in the first garden.

1262
01:45:44,416 --> 01:45:47,999
我读到敌对城市的兴起
I read about the rise of rival cities

1263
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,958
一座倒塌的塔
and the collapse of a tower

1264
01:45:50,458 --> 01:45:52,749
还有天神的愤怒
and the wrath of a God.

1265
01:45:52,750 --> 01:45:57,624
我读到人对抗恶龙
And I read about men that fought dragons

1266
01:45:57,625 --> 01:46:00,541
以及他们失去一切
and men who lost everything.

1267
01:46:01,416 --> 01:46:02,958
时光流逝
And time passed

1268
01:46:03,666 --> 01:46:06,916
随着秋叶凋零而远去
and fell away with the leaves of autumn.

1269
01:46:18,583 --> 01:46:21,708
亲爱的朋友,你没看过雪吗?
Have you never seen the snow, my dear friend?

1270
01:46:23,333 --> 01:46:27,125
它使世界洁净如洗...宛若新生
It makes the world clean... and new.

1271
01:46:33,041 --> 01:46:38,332
「『吾乃奥西曼迪斯,王中之王』」
"My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings."

1272
01:46:38,333 --> 01:46:41,833
「『观吾之伟业 豪杰如汝,亦当自愧弗如』」
"Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair."

1273
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,250
「巨像残骸四周」
"No thing beside remains."

1274
01:46:45,791 --> 01:46:50,082
「空无一物,唯见无际的荒凉」
"Round the decay of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare."

1275
01:46:50,083 --> 01:46:53,833
「平沙寂寂,绵延至天涯」
"The lone and level sands stretch far away."

1276
01:46:55,541 --> 01:46:58,833
「吾乃奥西曼迪斯...」
"My name is Ozymandias..."

1277
01:47:05,166 --> 01:47:07,750
除了这些,世上还有其他书吗?
Are there more books than this in the world?

1278
01:47:09,791 --> 01:47:11,666
肯定还有一些
A few more, I'm sure.

1279
01:47:12,416 --> 01:47:13,833
这里没有了
Not here.

1280
01:47:15,875 --> 01:47:18,875
左边最后一本,去拿吧
Last book on the left. Take it.

1281
01:47:19,375 --> 01:47:21,000
我们还没读那本书
We haven't got to it.

1282
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:24,249
《失乐园》,米尔顿着
Paradise Lost, Milton.

1283
01:47:24,250 --> 01:47:27,250
人类有问题想问神
Man has questions for God.

1284
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,250
连神自己也有疑问
Even God has questions.

1285
01:47:31,041 --> 01:47:32,790
祂应该是想知道答案
I think he wanted answers and that is why he sent us his son.

1286
01:47:32,791 --> 01:47:35,791
才会派儿子到凡间

1287
01:47:36,333 --> 01:47:38,791
祂大概是对死亡感兴趣吧
Death probably intrigued him.

1288
01:47:39,458 --> 01:47:40,333
苦难
Suffering.

1289
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:44,458
我想知道我是谁
I want to know who I am.

1290
01:47:45,166 --> 01:47:47,415
我从何而来?
Where do I come from?

1291
01:47:47,416 --> 01:47:49,415
神夺走你的记忆
God took your memory just as I wish he would take mine away.

1292
01:47:49,416 --> 01:47:52,791
我也希望祂夺走我的

1293
01:47:54,250 --> 01:47:57,541
多年以前,我曾杀死一个人
Many years ago, I took a man's life.

1294
01:47:58,208 --> 01:47:59,125
一个好人
A good man.

1295
01:47:59,666 --> 01:48:02,083
从此,我便赎罪至今
And I have been atoning for it since.

1296
01:48:04,375 --> 01:48:05,250
原谅
Forgive.

1297
01:48:06,166 --> 01:48:07,000
遗忘
Forget.

1298
01:48:07,708 --> 01:48:09,625
这是衡量智慧的真正准则
The true measure of wisdom.

1299
01:48:10,833 --> 01:48:12,957
知道你受到伤害
To know you have been harmed,

1300
01:48:12,958 --> 01:48:15,207
以及谁伤害你
by whom you have been harmed,

1301
01:48:15,208 --> 01:48:18,166
并选择释怀
and choose to let it all fade.

1302
01:48:19,250 --> 01:48:23,207
但我无法忘记我不记得的事
But I cannot forget what I cannot remember.

1303
01:48:23,208 --> 01:48:24,708
你什么都想不起来吗?
Do you recall nothing?

1304
01:48:30,166 --> 01:48:32,875
在我的梦中...
In my dreams...

1305
01:48:35,666 --> 01:48:38,916
我...看见回忆
...I... see memories.

1306
01:48:42,250 --> 01:48:43,791
都是不同的人
Different men.

1307
01:48:46,250 --> 01:48:49,000
全都...支离破碎的
All... pieces.

1308
01:48:55,958 --> 01:48:57,041
我...
I...

1309
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:03,125
我记得火和水
I remember f... fire and water.

1310
01:49:06,208 --> 01:49:08,208
还有脚底的沙子
And sand under my feet.

1311
01:49:15,375 --> 01:49:16,625
还有一个词
And a word.

1312
01:49:19,291 --> 01:49:20,791
就一个词
A single word.

1313
01:49:23,250 --> 01:49:24,541
什么词?
What is it?

1314
01:49:27,333 --> 01:49:28,333
维多
Victor.

1315
01:49:29,625 --> 01:49:30,791
去找吧
Go to it.

1316
01:49:31,750 --> 01:49:32,958
找那个词
The word.

1317
01:50:09,791 --> 01:50:11,833
然后我得知始末
And then I learned it.

1318
01:50:12,750 --> 01:50:14,958
骇人的真相
The horror of the truth.

1319
01:50:20,791 --> 01:50:23,916
我知道我什么都不是
I understood that I was nothing.

1320
01:50:25,208 --> 01:50:26,583
只是个可怜人
A wretch.

1321
01:50:27,125 --> 01:50:28,416
一块污渍
A blot.

1322
01:50:28,958 --> 01:50:32,083
跟人类的本质完全不同
Not even of the same nature as man.

1323
01:50:35,416 --> 01:50:37,666
这个伤痛在我心头萦绕
This hurt clung to my mind.

1324
01:50:39,791 --> 01:50:41,500
挥之不去
It never let go.

1325
01:51:24,916 --> 01:51:26,500
然后我看到了
Then I saw it.

1326
01:51:28,125 --> 01:51:29,500
你的名字
Your name.

1327
01:51:30,250 --> 01:51:33,665
「维多弗兰肯斯坦」
"Victor Frankenstein."

1328
01:51:33,666 --> 01:51:35,791
还有你在哪里
And where to find you.

1329
01:51:57,041 --> 01:51:58,291
不要!
No!

1330
01:51:59,541 --> 01:52:01,291
不要!
No!

1331
01:53:10,208 --> 01:53:11,707
你回来了
You came back.

1332
01:53:11,708 --> 01:53:14,166
我发现自己是什么了
I found what I am.

1333
01:53:18,333 --> 01:53:20,750
还有制造我的材料
What I am made from.

1334
01:53:23,375 --> 01:53:28,000
我是...一堆尸首的后代
I am... the child of a charnel house.

1335
01:53:31,416 --> 01:53:32,750
一具残骸
A wreckage.

1336
01:53:33,875 --> 01:53:37,291
用废料和弃尸拼凑而成
Assembled from refuse and the discarded dead.

1337
01:53:43,916 --> 01:53:45,125
一只怪物
A monster.

1338
01:53:46,666 --> 01:53:48,958
我知道你是什么
I know what you are.

1339
01:53:51,208 --> 01:53:52,333
一个好人
A good man.

1340
01:53:53,208 --> 01:53:57,708
而且...你是我的朋友
And... you are my friend.

1341
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:08,666
朋友?
Friend?

1342
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:11,666
朋友
Friend.

1343
01:54:14,916 --> 01:54:15,958
那是什么?
What is that thing?

1344
01:54:17,875 --> 01:54:19,625
是林子里那个东西吗?
The-- The thing from the woods?

1345
01:54:20,375 --> 01:54:22,083
你对他做了什么事?
What have you done to him?

1346
01:54:24,416 --> 01:54:25,375
别动
Don't move.

1347
01:54:36,750 --> 01:54:39,083
快点!装子弹!杀了牠!
Quick! Reload! Kill it!

1348
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,041
我又陷入寂静之中
There was silence again,

1349
01:55:56,291 --> 01:56:01,541
接着...是无情的生命
and then... merciless life.

1350
01:56:16,958 --> 01:56:19,249
我死了多久?
How long did I die for?

1351
01:56:19,250 --> 01:56:20,750
我不知道
I do not know.

1352
01:56:21,416 --> 01:56:23,708
但我看到身上的伤口复原了
But I saw my injuries healed.

1353
01:56:24,833 --> 01:56:28,458
冬天的冷空气刺痛我的肺
The cold winter air stung in my lungs.

1354
01:56:36,583 --> 01:56:39,708
我感受到前所未有的寂寞
I felt lonelier than ever,

1355
01:56:40,583 --> 01:56:45,500
因为对人类来说 只有一个方法能了结痛苦
because for every man there was but one remedy to all pain:

1356
01:56:46,416 --> 01:56:51,166
死亡,你却连这礼物也不给我
Death, a gift you too had denied me.

1357
01:56:52,125 --> 01:56:54,166
我心中涌起羡慕之情
Envy rose within me

1358
01:56:55,083 --> 01:56:58,083
决定向你提出一个请求
and decided to demand a single grace from you.

1359
01:56:59,416 --> 01:57:01,125
我的创造者
My creator.

1360
01:57:02,458 --> 01:57:07,083
我想要...一个伴侣
I would demand... a companion.

1361
01:57:33,541 --> 01:57:34,958
你得起床了
I need you to get up.

1362
01:57:36,333 --> 01:57:37,915
好,没问题
Yes, of course. Of course.

1363
01:57:37,916 --> 01:57:40,791
婚礼快开始了,我要你在我身边
The wedding will start soon and I want you by my side.

1364
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:42,791
要不是你心地善良
It's hard to believe,

1365
01:57:43,750 --> 01:57:45,750
很难相信你也能抱得美人归
if not for your kind nature.

1366
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,375
我跟几个宾客打听了调查进度
I've spoken to a few guests about the inquest.

1367
01:58:04,208 --> 01:58:05,291
关于爆炸案
About the explosion.

1368
01:58:06,958 --> 01:58:09,208
多数人都接受结果了
The majority accept it for what it was.

1369
01:58:11,541 --> 01:58:13,541
所以是什么结果,威廉?
And what was it, William?

1370
01:58:14,958 --> 01:58:16,041
结案了,维多
The past, Victor.

1371
01:58:17,708 --> 01:58:19,000
那是一桩可怕的意外
A terrible accident.

1372
01:58:26,333 --> 01:58:28,166
我打算卖掉庄园
I intend to sell the estate.

1373
01:58:31,583 --> 01:58:33,625
我们只拥有彼此了
All we have is each other.

1374
01:58:49,333 --> 01:58:51,249
我要你们到处撒花瓣
I want you to throw the petals everywhere.

1375
01:58:51,250 --> 01:58:52,750
要遍地都是
Throw them everywhere.

1376
01:58:55,291 --> 01:58:57,041
去楼上给我狠狠撒
Mm.
Go upstairs and do some more of that.

1377
01:59:06,458 --> 01:59:09,916
我知道在仪式前见到新娘不吉利
I know it is bad luck to see the bride before the ceremony.

1378
01:59:10,541 --> 01:59:11,750
只有新郎不能见
Only for the groom.

1379
01:59:13,416 --> 01:59:14,958
说得对,我没差
Yes, that's right. Not for me.

1380
01:59:17,250 --> 01:59:18,458
你好,伊莉莎白
Hello, Elizabeth.

1381
01:59:21,375 --> 01:59:24,875
我以前鲜少后悔,而今却懊恼万分
I've rarely felt remorse before and now I feel little else. I...

1382
01:59:25,583 --> 01:59:29,624
是我痴狂得太久,不过都结束了
A fever gripped me for so long, but it has passed,

1383
01:59:29,625 --> 01:59:31,833
我现在对你没有非分之想
and I see you now as I should.

1384
01:59:33,541 --> 01:59:37,582
无论如何,我都要祝福你和我弟弟
For whatever it's worth, I... I wish you and my little brother,

1385
01:59:37,583 --> 01:59:40,500
而我爱他胜于生命,愿你们幸福圆满
who I love more than life, the very best.

1386
01:59:43,208 --> 01:59:45,166
你自己可能深信不疑
You may like to believe you do.

1387
01:59:49,250 --> 01:59:51,125
你敢说,我是不敢听
And I dread to even hear it.

1388
01:59:55,208 --> 01:59:57,916
我的大喜之日要请你帮个忙
On my wedding day, I ask you but for a single grace.

1389
01:59:59,250 --> 02:00:00,458
别再说谎了
No more lies.

1390
02:00:01,875 --> 02:00:03,790
- 我想告诉你... - 马上离开新娘房
- I-- I want to tell you-- - Leave my chambers now.

1391
02:00:03,791 --> 02:00:06,125
- 伊莉莎白 - 出去!
- Elizabeth. - Leave!

1392
02:01:00,166 --> 02:01:02,125
从阴影中走出来
Come out of the shadows,

1393
02:01:03,125 --> 02:01:04,500
如果你在这里
if you are here.

1394
02:01:21,958 --> 02:01:23,208
你是来感谢我的吗?
Are you here to thank me?

1395
02:01:23,833 --> 02:01:27,375
你大难不死,还聪明到找得到我
You survived and are intelligent enough to have found me.

1396
02:01:29,375 --> 02:01:30,790
我把你造得很好
I made you well.

1397
02:01:30,791 --> 02:01:37,541
我需要你为我制造一个伴侣
I need you to make a companion for me.

1398
02:01:38,166 --> 02:01:40,207
一个像我的人
One like me.

1399
02:01:40,208 --> 02:01:42,458
伴侣?
A com... A companion?

1400
02:01:48,125 --> 02:01:49,125
我懂了
Oh.
I see.

1401
02:01:53,416 --> 02:01:54,750
另一只怪物
Another monster.

1402
02:01:55,416 --> 02:01:56,416
对
Yes.

1403
02:01:57,291 --> 02:01:59,458
我们可以一起当怪物
We can be monsters together.

1404
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:07,415
我付出惨痛代价才恢复理性
I have found sanity at such a cost,

1405
02:02:07,416 --> 02:02:11,499
而你...这疯子要我重蹈覆辙
and you here... are madness calling me back.

1406
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:13,708
我死不了
I cannot die.

1407
02:02:17,333 --> 02:02:19,375
我也无法...
And I cannot live...

1408
02:02:21,916 --> 02:02:22,958
独活
alone.

1409
02:02:24,250 --> 02:02:26,791
你明知道我造出极其恐怖的东西
In you I have created something truly horrible.

1410
02:02:28,041 --> 02:02:30,041
我不是东西
Not something.

1411
02:02:30,958 --> 02:02:32,791
是人
Someone.

1412
02:02:33,625 --> 02:02:37,000
你造了一个人
You made someone.

1413
02:02:37,708 --> 02:02:38,625
我
Me.

1414
02:02:39,541 --> 02:02:42,333
就算我是个谜,创造者,我会思考
Whatever puzzle I am, creator, I think.

1415
02:02:43,208 --> 02:02:44,458
我有感受
I feel.

1416
02:02:45,958 --> 02:02:47,666
我有一个小请求...
I have this sole petition...

1417
02:02:48,541 --> 02:02:52,625
制造一个像我这样的人
Make one like me.

1418
02:02:54,375 --> 02:02:55,500
然后呢?
And then what?

1419
02:02:56,583 --> 02:02:58,291
生殖
Procreation.

1420
02:03:00,083 --> 02:03:01,708
繁衍
Reproduction.
Mm...

1421
02:03:06,541 --> 02:03:07,708
成家?
A home?

1422
02:03:08,625 --> 02:03:10,041
丧礼?
A grave?

1423
02:03:11,625 --> 02:03:15,332
死亡繁衍死亡,又再繁衍死亡
Death begetting death begetting death.

1424
02:03:15,333 --> 02:03:17,499
恶魔种族在世间开枝散叶
A race of devils propagated upon the earth.

1425
02:03:17,500 --> 02:03:19,708
发泄淫欲,自行繁殖后代
Obscenity perpetuating itself.

1426
02:03:20,500 --> 02:03:23,957
你当我淫兽,但我只是人罢了
I am obscene to you, but to myself I simply am.

1427
02:03:23,958 --> 02:03:25,291
给我滚!
Begone!

1428
02:03:27,625 --> 02:03:33,916
我再也不会造出你这种邪恶的畸形物
Never again will I make something like you, wicked and deformed.

1429
02:03:38,375 --> 02:03:44,416
结果仍是你的意志至上,维多
Then it is still all about your will, Victor.

1430
02:03:47,125 --> 02:03:52,458
赐给我生命又谴责我的可怕意志?
Hmm?
That horrible, horrible will that birthed me condemns me now?

1431
02:03:53,833 --> 02:03:58,458
我会说话不是奇迹,你会聆听才是!
The miracle is not that I should speak, but that you would ever listen!

1432
02:04:02,166 --> 02:04:04,832
如果你不给我爱
If you are not to award me love, then I will indulge in rage.

1433
02:04:04,833 --> 02:04:07,415
我将怒火冲天

1434
02:04:07,416 --> 02:04:09,875
而且永不止息
And mine is infinite.

1435
02:04:15,166 --> 02:04:16,582
借过
Step aside.

1436
02:04:16,583 --> 02:04:17,625
维多
Victor.

1437
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,041
怎么回事?
What's going on?

1438
02:04:38,833 --> 02:04:39,875
你...
You...

1439
02:04:44,833 --> 02:04:45,708
你...
You...

1440
02:04:46,708 --> 02:04:47,625
是你
It's you.

1441
02:04:52,791 --> 02:04:55,166
伊莉莎白,离牠远一点!
Elizabeth, move away from it!

1442
02:04:55,791 --> 02:04:56,708
不要!
No!

1443
02:05:10,958 --> 02:05:13,791
牠攻击她!
It attacked her! It attacked her!

1444
02:05:33,291 --> 02:05:34,833
带我跟你走
Take me with you.

1445
02:05:48,833 --> 02:05:50,666
我的天哪!
Oh, my God!

1446
02:06:16,291 --> 02:06:18,540
不行,让我...我会救你
No, let me... I can save you.

1447
02:06:18,541 --> 02:06:19,750
我会救你
I can save you.

1448
02:06:20,333 --> 02:06:21,333
是什么要害我?
From what?

1449
02:06:22,791 --> 02:06:23,916
你吗?
From you?

1450
02:06:25,416 --> 02:06:26,790
我怕你,维多
I fear you, Victor.

1451
02:06:26,791 --> 02:06:27,999
别说了...
No, no...

1452
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:29,707
从小就很怕
I always have.

1453
02:06:29,708 --> 02:06:32,500
每一丁点疯狂和毁灭
Every ounce of madness and destruction.

1454
02:06:33,750 --> 02:06:37,333
吞噬万物的猛火烈焰
The very conflagration that devoured everything.

1455
02:06:39,166 --> 02:06:40,541
都是来自于你
It all came from you.

1456
02:06:46,541 --> 02:06:48,041
你才是怪物
You are the monster.

1457
02:07:21,125 --> 02:07:23,291
我在这世界从来没有归属感
My place was never in this world.

1458
02:07:25,166 --> 02:07:29,750
我曾寻找过一份难以言喻的渴望
I sought and longed for something I could not quite name.

1459
02:07:31,666 --> 02:07:33,541
但我在你身上找到了
But in you, I found it.

1460
02:07:36,833 --> 02:07:39,291
失而复得
To be lost and to be found,

1461
02:07:40,291 --> 02:07:42,291
正是爱的寿命
that is the lifespan of love.

1462
02:07:44,291 --> 02:07:45,708
纵然转瞬即逝
And in its brevity,

1463
02:07:46,875 --> 02:07:48,208
以悲剧告终...
its tragedy...

1464
02:07:52,291 --> 02:07:54,125
却因此永垂不朽
this has been made eternal.

1465
02:07:57,916 --> 02:08:01,333
就此离去...也算无憾
Better this way... to fade...

1466
02:08:03,375 --> 02:08:05,625
因为有你凝视着我
with your eyes gazing upon me.

1467
02:08:48,291 --> 02:08:51,375
她走了,我想随她而去
She is gone and I long to follow.

1468
02:08:56,041 --> 02:08:58,333
你赐给我生命,非我所愿
You gave me life unwanted.

1469
02:08:59,625 --> 02:09:01,500
我要归还给你
I give that back to you.

1470
02:09:02,291 --> 02:09:04,208
你当我是怪物
You thought me a monster.

1471
02:09:05,041 --> 02:09:07,041
现在我要回敬你
Now I return the favor.

1472
02:09:12,708 --> 02:09:15,375
杀了我!现在就动手杀了我吧!
Kill me! Kill me now, do it!

1473
02:09:16,416 --> 02:09:18,291
我会让你流血
I will make you bleed.

1474
02:09:19,125 --> 02:09:21,250
我会使你谦卑
I will make you humble.

1475
02:09:21,916 --> 02:09:23,583
你是我的创造者
You may be my creator,

1476
02:09:24,166 --> 02:09:28,208
但今天起,我是你的主人
but from this day forward, I will be your master.

1477
02:10:08,041 --> 02:10:09,624
你一路追杀我
You hunted me past the forests,

1478
02:10:09,625 --> 02:10:12,416
越过重重森林

1479
02:10:13,083 --> 02:10:15,041
翻山越岭
past the mountains,

1480
02:10:15,666 --> 02:10:18,083
踏破冰封的地平线
past frozen horizons,

1481
02:10:19,125 --> 02:10:22,041
直到一片苍茫
until there was nothing left.

1482
02:10:22,666 --> 02:10:26,083
只剩下你...和我
Just you... and me.

1483
02:10:46,208 --> 02:10:47,125
我需要弹药
I need ammunition.

1484
02:10:50,333 --> 02:10:51,749
把刀磨利
Sharpen this.

1485
02:10:51,750 --> 02:10:54,208
三罐炼乳、木柴
Three cans of condensed milk, some firewood.

1486
02:10:56,166 --> 02:10:57,540
还要六根炸药
And six sticks of dynamite.

1487
02:10:57,541 --> 02:10:58,541
六根?
Six?

1488
02:10:59,541 --> 02:11:00,791
你要猎捕什么?
What are you hunting?

1489
02:11:02,375 --> 02:11:03,625
巨兽
Big game.

1490
02:12:11,541 --> 02:12:13,583
不要!
No! No! No!

1491
02:12:22,333 --> 02:12:24,040
维多
Victor.

1492
02:12:24,041 --> 02:12:27,458
只有伤害你时,你才会听我说话
You only listen when I hurt you.

1493
02:12:41,416 --> 02:12:44,957
你对这玩意儿有信心
This. You put your faith in this.

1494
02:12:44,958 --> 02:12:47,375
你认为这会消灭我
You think this will unmake me.

1495
02:12:51,833 --> 02:12:54,790
那就希望点燃后一举成功,不然的话
Hmm.
Light it then and hope it does, but if it does not,

1496
02:12:54,791 --> 02:12:57,749
我会再去找你
I will come for you again.

1497
02:12:57,750 --> 02:12:59,500
点啊!
Light it!

1498
02:13:06,833 --> 02:13:10,208
现在...快逃吧
Now... run.

1499
02:13:47,083 --> 02:13:53,125
你躺在那里,伤痕累累,弃如敝屣
So, there you were, broken and discarded.

1500
02:13:53,875 --> 02:13:55,250
而我
And I,

1501
02:13:56,500 --> 02:13:58,541
又复活了
alive again.

1502
02:14:03,125 --> 02:14:08,166
我能感觉到焦肉在重新生长
I could feel my singed flesh regrowing.

1503
02:14:09,041 --> 02:14:12,916
一身骨头劈啪作响地调整
The crackling of my bones resetting.

1504
02:14:14,041 --> 02:14:20,375
血液从不停跳动的心脏中汨汨流出
The murmur of my blood pumping through my incessant heart.

1505
02:14:21,500 --> 02:14:24,458
死神再次无情离去
And once more finding no mercy,

1506
02:14:25,958 --> 02:14:28,416
我只剩一条路可走
I had but one path.

1507
02:14:40,458 --> 02:14:42,208
于是我们来到了这里
And here we are.

1508
02:14:44,750 --> 02:14:46,666
耗尽一切,无以为继
Spent and done.

1509
02:14:49,541 --> 02:14:53,207
我们都心力交瘁了
No more in us to give or take.

1510
02:14:53,208 --> 02:14:54,999
帐篷外面的血迹...
The blood outside the tent...

1511
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:56,125
那是我的
It is mine.

1512
02:14:57,458 --> 02:14:58,916
都是我的
All mine.

1513
02:15:00,041 --> 02:15:01,333
我会流血
I will bleed.

1514
02:15:02,875 --> 02:15:04,166
疼痛
Ache.

1515
02:15:04,916 --> 02:15:06,041
受苦
Suffer.

1516
02:15:09,166 --> 02:15:12,000
永无止境
You see, it will never end.

1517
02:15:32,041 --> 02:15:33,583
对不起
I am sorry.

1518
02:15:40,083 --> 02:15:42,125
我悔不当初
Regret consumes me.

1519
02:15:44,166 --> 02:15:46,791
我现在才认清我的人生
And I now regard my life for what it was.

1520
02:15:49,291 --> 02:15:51,708
你将撒手而去,创造者
You will go now, creator.

1521
02:15:54,375 --> 02:15:55,958
悄然消逝
Fade away.

1522
02:15:58,750 --> 02:16:01,416
一下子就结束了
It will all be but a brief moment.

1523
02:16:03,083 --> 02:16:06,041
我的出生、伤悲
My birth. My grief.

1524
02:16:07,041 --> 02:16:08,500
你的失落
Your loss.

1525
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,250
我不会受到惩罚
I will not be punished.

1526
02:16:14,750 --> 02:16:16,500
也不会被赦免
Nor absolved.

1527
02:16:20,833 --> 02:16:22,166
我曾抱持的希望
What hope I had,

1528
02:16:23,250 --> 02:16:24,791
愤怒...
what rage...

1529
02:16:26,666 --> 02:16:28,041
都微不足道了
It is all nothing.

1530
02:16:31,250 --> 02:16:35,708
当初带我来的浪潮,如今要将你带走
The tide that brought me here now comes to take you away.

1531
02:16:38,250 --> 02:16:39,541
我仍得不到解脱
Leaving me stranded.

1532
02:16:47,916 --> 02:16:49,583
原谅我
Forgive me.

1533
02:16:51,375 --> 02:16:52,625
儿子
My son.

1534
02:17:00,708 --> 02:17:05,375
可以的话,就原谅自己,好好活着
And if you have it in your heart, forgive yourself into existence.

1535
02:17:06,125 --> 02:17:08,624
若死神不肯成全你
If death is not to be, then consider this, my son.

1536
02:17:08,625 --> 02:17:10,500
那也别无他法,儿子

1537
02:17:11,083 --> 02:17:12,541
因为你终究会活下去
While you are alive,

1538
02:17:13,791 --> 02:17:16,583
除了活着,你有其他选择吗?
what recourse do you have but to live?

1539
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:25,083
活下去
Live.

1540
02:17:26,750 --> 02:17:28,000
叫我的名字
Say my name.

1541
02:17:29,833 --> 02:17:32,083
我父亲给了我那个名字
My father gave me that name,

1542
02:17:33,250 --> 02:17:34,541
但那名字毫无意义
and it meant nothing.

1543
02:17:37,083 --> 02:17:39,375
现在我要你再叫我...
Now I ask you to give it back to me...

1544
02:17:41,750 --> 02:17:43,125
最后一次
one last time.

1545
02:17:45,041 --> 02:17:47,291
用你最初的方式叫吧
The way you said it at the beginning.

1546
02:17:48,416 --> 02:17:50,708
当时,那是你的一切
When it meant the world to you.

1547
02:17:56,291 --> 02:17:57,541
维多
Victor.

1548
02:18:00,625 --> 02:18:02,125
我原谅你
I forgive you.

1549
02:18:25,208 --> 02:18:27,875
安息吧,父亲
Rest now, Father.

1550
02:18:32,250 --> 02:18:33,625
或许此刻
Perhaps now,

1551
02:18:35,583 --> 02:18:37,833
我俩能同为人类
