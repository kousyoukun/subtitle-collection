00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,674
自从诞生以来，
THE ACCOUNTANT: Since the birth of time,

3
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:40,149
人类竭力用监狱来控制罪犯
humanity has endeavored to restrain evil men in prisons.

4
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,648
但是自从 该隐放跑了杀他兄弟的凶手后，
But since Cain fled
the murder of his brother,

5
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:45,052
监狱的那堵墙已经不能够阻挡那些罪犯。
evil men have fled the walls of punishment.

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,656
因此，如果你是一个婊子养的在逃犯，这一切将不再重要，
So, it doesn't matter if you're a badass motherfucker on the run,

7
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:51,922
因为你认为你比别人优秀，
because you think you're better than everyone else,

8
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:55,522
就可以坏事做尽。
and somehow entitled to do what you gotta do.

9
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:57,396
不....
No.

10
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:01,334
因为，你知道，那些婊子养的坏蛋们从来都不够快。
Because, you see, badass motherfuckers are never fast enough.

11
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:06,733
所以到最后，他们最终都被算计了。
In the end, they will all be accounted for.

12
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:13,716
（轮胎的摩擦声）
(TIRES SQUEALING)

13
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,696
狗娘养的！赶快离开这里。
Son of a bitch! Came out of nowhere.

14
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:31,029
-她不是说他已经死了吗?         -你发现他了吗?
-Didn't she say he was dead?   -You see him?

15
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,199
-我想我们已经甩掉了他。 -我亲耳听到她说他已经死了。
-I think we lost him.   -I swear she said he was dead.

16
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:35,637
-小心看路！      -好的，操他妈的！
-Keep watching!  -Well, fucking he ain't!

17
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,609
-专心驾驶这辆操蛋的车！  -我正在驾驶这该死的车！
-Drive the fucking car!  -I'm driving the goddamn car!

18
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,244
我还没发现他。
I don't see him.

19
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,610
同伙:他知道一切。他知道我们对她做了什么。
SIDE PASSENGER: He knows.He knows what we did to her.

20
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,020
他知道！他来找我们算账了！
He knows! He's gonna make us pay!

21
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,921
-操！操！操！        -我想我们甩掉了他。
-Shit! Shit! Shit!   -I think we lost him.

22
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:01,694

26
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:05,193
我绝不会告诉你我们把他弄到了哪儿，绝不
I ain't never telling you where they've taken her. Never.

27
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,156
我知道
I know.

28
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,665
你弄断了我的退，你这混蛋！
You took my leg, you fuck!

30
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:19,704
对不起，哥们
I'm sorry, man.

31
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,106
她在哪里?
Where is she?

32
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,272
-我不知道，大哥。    -那个女孩在哪里?
-I don't know, man.  -Where is the baby girl?

33
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,781
我不知道，大哥
I don't know, man.

34

37
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,412
斯蒂尔沃特！别！别！
Stillwater! Hey! Hey!

38
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:36,653
好吧，邓肯的树，大哥。 斯蒂尔沃特马什！
Okay, Deacon's Tree, man. Stillwater Marsh!

39
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:38,729
在德克萨斯州，我想。
Texas, I think.

40
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,892
你已经来迟了。你应该知道，是把?
You're too late. You gotta know that, right?

41
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:45,361
满月的时候她就会死掉，大哥。
First full moon, she's dead, man.

42
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:49,762
她一死地狱将会降临到这该死的土地上。
She's dead and hell's gonna walk the motherfucking earth.

43
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,379
地狱已经来到了这片土地上
Hell already is walking the earth.

44
00:03:55,435 --> 00:04:00,885
你去告诉他我来了。告诉他我将会把她带回来。
You tell him I'm coming. Tell him I'm coming to get her back.

45
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,118

00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:47,020
所以，我告诉他，我说：“弗兰克，就这样吧，没有廉价的牛奶（爱情）”
So, I tell him, I says, "Frank, that's it.
No more free milk.

50
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:49,088
“为了更多的奶，你不得不去买一只牛，你这狗娘养的”
"You gonna have to buy the cow,you son of a bitch."

51
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:50,857
但是你很苗条啊，派珀
But you are not fat,piper.

52
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,732
什么?不是的，诺玛吉恩。"花钱...娶我..."
What? No, Norma Jean. "Buy the cow...Marry me...“

53
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:58,399
我是说他想要娶我。我把他给甩了
I'm saying he's gotta marry me.I cut him off.

54
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,409
你甩了他?
You cut him off?

55
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,843
-是的，这还没来得及做，是的！
-(LAUGHS) Not just yes, but hell, yes!
-(LAUGHING)

56
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:07,180
没乳房，没屁股，同时我告诉他，
No tits, no ass, and I told him,

57
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,387
"如果再让我看见你的鸡巴在我的脸附近晃"
"If I see that big ol' dick
anywhere near my face again,

58
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,012
-"我会把它咬成两半"  -"哈哈，你这样说的？"
-"I'm gonna bite it in half." -(LAUGHS) You said that?

59
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,818
是的，我就是这样说的。
PIPER: Yeah, sure did.

60
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,986
噢，上帝啊。你们多久没见面了？
Oh, my God. How long has it been?

61
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:21,029
哦，两天。但是就像过了十年之久一样
Oh, two days. But that's like a decade in horny fucker years.

62
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,656
那么，他给你买钻戒了吗？
So, he bought you a diamond?

63
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,598
噢，上帝，没有。如果弗兰克有钱买砖戒，
Oh, God, no.If Frank had money for a diamond,

64
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:28,161
那我也许会狠踹他的屁股然后从后面将这塞进他的屁眼里
I would have jacked his sorry ass ages ago
and put this shit hole in rear view.

65
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:31,299
但是他确实求我做他的妻子
But he did get down on one knee
and ask me to be his bride.

66
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,933
-没门！噢！ -是的，没可能！
-No way! Oh! -Yes, way!

Come on, come on!

70

你认为我会付钱给一个只会瞎嚷嚷的婊子吗？
You think I pay you bitches
to stand around and yap?

71
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,244
滚回来干活
Get the fuck back to work.

72
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,614
淑女一点，宝贝
Sit on it, baby.

73
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:53,162
嗨，伙计。我叫派珀。你需要喝点什么？
Hi, guys. I'm Piper.
Can I get you something to drink?

74
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,096
我要这个

75
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:59,034
她是我们这里专门制作的早餐饼。十怪物饼，售价$4.99
"She's a Brickhouse" breakfast. Ten monster flapjacks for $4.99.

76
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,072
-再来三杯水  -好的，还有什么需要的吗
-And three waters. -All right, and what can I get for...

77
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,232
就这些。只要那个饼干了，如果可以的话
That's it. Just the pancakes, if that's okay.

78

80
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,313
嗨，美女。来份咖啡？
Hello, beautiful. Coffee?

81
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,944
黑咖啡，加点糖
Black, with sugar.

82
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:23,451
你听说过斯蒂尔沃特马什或者林肯的树吗？在德克萨斯州，也许？
Have you ever heard of a Stillwater Marsh
or a Deacon's Tree? In Texas, maybe?

83
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,757
斯蒂尔沃特沼泽，是的，我曾听说过
Stillwater Marsh, yeah, I've heard of it,

84
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,659
但是好像不在德克萨斯州
but it ain't in Texas.

85
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,557
斯蒂尔沃特在路易斯安那
Stillwater is in Louisiana.

86
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,162
小镇子？
Small town?

87
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,395
亲爱的，斯蒂尔沃特是一座监狱
Honey, Stillwater is a prison.

88
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:37,441
在拆掉以前我的父亲在那里呆过一段时间
My daddy did some time there before it closed.

89
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,400
我马上给你上咖啡
I'll get you that coffee.

90
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,440
这里有一些松饼和加热的牛奶
Here's some muffins and warm milk.

91
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,411
-但是我没有叫这些...  -免费送的
-But we didn't order... -it's on the house.

92
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,881
所以，你要问这些的话就要等到我下班之后？
So, you gonna ask me what time my shift ends?

93
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,227
今晚是满月
It's a full moon tonight.

94
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,728
我经常在满月时感觉自己变得有一点点急躁
I always feel a little randy with a full moon.

95
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,158
两天后满月就会消失
Full moon's two days off.

96
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,132
你确定你说的是正确的，甜心？
You sure about that, sweetie?

97
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,169
十分确定
Pretty sure.

98
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:16,105
现在，外面那辆糟糕的车是你的？
Now, that's a hell of a ride out there. Is that yours?

99
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,445
那辆道奇？不是我的
The Charger? I wish.

100
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,311
是她的吗？
Is it hers?

PIPER: All right, here are them waters.

I'll be right back with the flapjacks.

103
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,319
好的。但是如果你在找人载你一程...
Sure. But if you're looking for a ride...

104
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,564
我告诉过你我要一些糖
I told you I wanted sugar.

105
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,611
免费？他妈的免费？

Relax. We gonna
throw them muffins out, anyway.

107
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:58,585

never touch me like that again.

-Let go of my balls.  -Shut up.

送松饼的是我的主意，我不干了
Muffins are on me. I quit.

111
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,904
在他们的松饼里放点蜂蜜。他们从来没品尝过那样的味道

They'll taste an awful lot better that way.

00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:10,897
嘿，他是什么意思
TEEN: Hey, what does that mean?

538
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,806
我女儿大学毕业之后就跟王在一起
MILTON: My daughter got mixed up with King
straight out of college.

539
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,402
她认识她？他认识乔恩教父？
PIPER: She knew him? She knew Jonah King?

540
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:20,108
她认识他，是的...他认识
She knew him, yes, yes, she did.

541
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:23,547
他的世界被推向深渊，
Her world was in a tailspin,

542
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:26,588
而King却说这是一场洗礼
and King was preaching quiet revolution.

543
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:30,090
四个月以前她发现了‘净化’的意思
It was four months before she realized
"quiet" meant hiding

544
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,524
在一间地下室里，切鸡后仰
in a basement,cutting the heads off of chickens.

545
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,426
乔恩教父的巫术？
Jonah King's into voodoo?

546
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,361
不是巫术，是撒旦的魔法
Not voodoo, satanic magic.

547
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:38,894
他是为了自己的大决战做准备
He was recruiting for
his own personal Armageddon.

548
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,132
可想而知，我女儿想离开
Understandably, my daughter wanted out.

549
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,896
当她告诉他要离开时
When she told him she was leaving,

550
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:46,006
他在三个地方用铁轮圈打断了她的腿
he broke her leg in three places
with a tire iron.

老天
Jesus.

552
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:50,341
他得到了教训
She learned her lesson,

553
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:53,438
她只是一个才入教18个月的信徒，后来的一天晚上
was a good little follower for 18 months,
then one night,

554
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:57,018
她单独见乔恩的时候把他的脸刺伤了
she got Jonah alone
and stabbed him in his face

555
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:58,347
用一个五角星挂件
with a pentagram pendant,

556
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,752
然后消失在黑暗中
and vanished into the darkness.

557
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:03,053
米尔顿，你的女儿在邪教待了两年，
Milton, your daughter was
in a cult for two years,

558
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:05,616
难道你不知道吗？
and you didn't even know about it?

559
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:07,423
我的意思是说，你为什么不去救她？
I mean, why didn't you help her before?

560
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:10,892
我没有找到任何关于这个组织的线索，直到...
I didn't find out about any of this until...

561
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,291
直到我被锁了起来
Until after I got locked up.

562
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,871
你没有再装弹？
You're not gonna reload?

563
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,498
一开始只有三发子弹
Only three bullets to begin.

你能说说是怎么回事吗？
Can you explain this, please?

01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:44,052
他很爱他的女儿
He loved his daughter.

所有的父亲都爱自己的女儿
A lot of daddies love their daughters.

767
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:52,299
但这并不能说明什么
But it don't explain shattering reality.

768
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:57,338
嗯，这家伙太爱自己的女儿了以至于使她恨他
Well, that one loved his little girl
enough to make her hate him.

769
01:04:58,327 --> 01:04:59,829
啊，他是...
Uh, he was...

770
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:05,238
他是一个不合格的丈夫
He was a bad, bad husband.

771
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:08,543
但是他是一个好父亲
But he was a good father.

772
01:05:09,438 --> 01:05:13,215
只是误交了损友
And then, we went and got mixed up
in the wrong crowd.

773
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:16,348
一旦走入歧途，就无法自拔了
And once you are in,
there ain't no getting out.

774
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:21,624
所以，为了不连累她，当她还在读高中时他选择了离开
So, to protect her, he vanished
while she was still in high school.

775
01:05:22,118 --> 01:05:23,495

-But you got out.
-Yeah, I did.

777
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:31,198
但是因为他跟同伙间有一点点过节
But only 'cause he paid a little visit
to some fellows

778
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:34,332

when the job was done.

He went alone, you see. I would've gone,

780
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:45,486
但是我并不知道
but I didn't know.

781
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:49,645
我也只好逃了
I would've gone.

而是你的怒火

788
01:06:24,847 --> 01:06:28,761
是因你爱的人所遭受的痛苦
It's about the suffering
of those you love because

789
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:31,229
你见到的一切
that's all you see

790
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,635
你只能眼铮铮的看着
in full detail.

791
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:39,702
而没有办法去解救他们
And there's nothing you can do
to shut it off.

我被枪毙的时候她才16岁
My daughter was 16 when I got shot.

793
01:06:48,904 --> 01:06:50,906
我看见她在哭泣
I watched her weep.

794
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:53,651
我看见她在责骂我
I watched her curse me.

795
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:58,592
我看见她加入了邪教
I watched her join that cult.

796
01:07:00,883 --> 01:07:02,726
我看见了他们被谋杀
I watched the murders.

然后是我的女儿
And then my daughter.

799

这团怒火
Burning is nothing

800
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:29,886

compared to watching
your child's head being torn off.

01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:40,928

Thank you, Webster. I don't believe
I'll be having that beer just now.

802
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:47,434
还要用乔恩的颅骨盛来喝
Not unless I'm drinking it

01:20:37,165 --> 01:20:38,405
我偶然得知
I happen to know,

951
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:43,108
通过祭祀小孩的方法得到力量使他非常苦恼
the idea of sacrificing children in his honor
annoys him greatly.

952
01:20:47,275 --> 01:20:50,017
-这是你帮助我的真正原因？ -我们都有事要做了。
-Why are you really helping me?
-We all have a job to do.

953
01:20:50,111 --> 01:20:53,490
如果你帮助我的话，事情将变得简单起来。而你会得到你想要的
Getting you here makes my job easier.
You get what you want,

954
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:55,823
-我能得到我想要的 -帮我吧
-I get what I want.
-Then help me now.

955
01:20:55,917 --> 01:20:57,294
-不。 -他们在那里埋伏了40人，
-No.
-There are 40 of them down there,

956
01:20:57,352 --> 01:20:58,956
-你和我能... -不
-and you and I could...
-No.

957
01:21:08,797 --> 01:21:11,744
你想救他，米尔顿？那就去做你该做的
You want to save her, Milton?
Then you go, and you do it.

958
01:21:16,771 --> 01:21:18,751
如果你赢了，我赢了
If you win, I win.

959
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,514
如果他们干掉了你，我也赢了
If they take you down, I win.

960
01:21:30,785 --> 01:21:32,526
我希望你再接再厉
And I hope you like butter on your popcorn.

961
01:21:32,621 --> 01:21:34,157
这肯定是一场盛大的表演
It's sure to be a grand show.

962
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:38,227
你怎么还在这里？米尔顿，时间不等人，午夜马上到了
You're still here? Milton, the clock's ticking.
Midnight approaches,

963
01:21:38,326 --> 01:21:40,272
-月亮已经变圆了 -给我车钥匙
-and the moon is full.
-Give me the keys.

964
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:43,170
我会在这里等你
THE ACCOUNTANT: I'll be right here.

965
01:21:46,034 --> 01:21:47,570
我的孩子
KING: My children,

966
01:21:48,203 --> 01:21:49,739
我们已经走很远了
we have come so far

967
01:21:49,938 --> 01:21:53,010
这里就是死亡之地
to this place where the dying earth

968
01:21:53,108 --> 01:21:55,452
我们脚下充满了血腥的味道
bleeds its corrupt soul at our feet.

969
01:21:55,944 --> 01:21:58,982
她的死，会让我们获得新生
From its death, we shall all be reborn.

970
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:01,560
新生
ALL: Reborn!

971
01:22:02,217 --> 01:22:03,594
我们...
We...

972
01:22:03,685 --> 01:22:05,756
我们受尽了磨难
We have been cast out and hunted.

973
01:22:07,022 --> 01:22:08,763
这些都不再有了
But no more!

974
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:10,468
不再有了
No more.

(GASPS)

976
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:19,676
随着这次祭祀
With this sacrifice,

977
01:22:20,035 --> 01:22:21,673
我们将不会被抛弃
we shall no longer be shunned.

978
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:23,812
他们说我们天生软弱
They say the meek will inherit.

979
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:27,719
他们在撒谎！我们不软弱！我们有自己的选择！
They lie! We are not meek! We are chosen!

980
01:22:28,109 --> 01:22:31,989
很快，我们就能控制一切
And soon, the hounds of perdition
will howl at our command!

981
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:35,921
现在，只要用这匕首轻轻一刺
For now, with a single thrust of this dagger,

982
01:22:35,984 --> 01:22:37,964
我们都将被解放！
we shall all be set free!

这他妈的说的些什么啊？
MAN: What the fuck?

986
01:23:23,798 --> 01:23:25,368
是他！
That's him!

987
01:23:26,935 --> 01:23:28,175
妈的，抓住他！
Come on, let's get him!

988
01:23:33,475 --> 01:23:36,581
在这里，抓住他！今晚不管怎么样，这孩子死定了
Here, take it.
No matter what, that child dies tonight.

989
01:23:36,644 --> 01:23:38,681
我要你们割开他的喉咙
I tell you to, and you cut his throat.

990
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:46,594
他在这里
MAN: That's him.

991
01:23:47,255 --> 01:23:48,529
他们跟米尔顿是一伙的
They're both with Milton.

992
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:51,570
喔，是吗？你以为你能阻止这一切吗？
Oh, yeah? You think you can stop all this?

-(BABY CRYING)
-(SHUSHING)

994
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:03,278
我们会把你的朋友和这孩子都杀掉，然后我们将获得永生
We're gonna kill your friend and the baby.
And We're gonna live forever.

995
01:24:03,905 --> 01:24:05,509
永生？
Forever?

996
01:24:05,907 --> 01:24:09,013
如果你指的是下一个5秒钟，那么我成全你
If forever to you is the next five seconds,
then you would be right.

997
01:24:22,991 --> 01:24:24,265
嗯...
Well...

998
01:24:36,504 --> 01:24:38,609
准备好了吗.
You be ready now.

999
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:42,584
如果把你杀了，你就带不走他了
If kill you, you can't take him.

1000
01:24:42,777 --> 01:24:45,951
杀了我还会有别人。
Someone else will come.
Someone else always comes.

1001
01:24:47,248 --> 01:24:50,786
派珀，他偷那个不是为了阻止我。
Piper, he didn't steal that to stop me.

1002
01:24:50,885 --> 01:24:53,593
他偷那个是想拖住我来达到他的目的
He stole it to slow me down.
He's getting what he wanted.

1003
01:24:53,988 --> 01:24:55,661
去他那里
Go to him.

1004
01:24:56,257 --> 01:24:58,259
现在，在为时已晚以前

好吧，让这一切都见鬼去吧。
Well, this has all gone to shit.

我叫你把那该死的宝宝抱给我
I said bring the fucking baby to me!

我来是要杀你
I'm going to kill you.

1027
01:29:42,009 --> 01:29:46,458
啊哈，米尔顿，已经有很多人这么说过了
Ah, Milton, so many have tried.

1028
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:54,222
但是我有一个厉害的东西是你闻所未闻的
But I am armored with a power that you will never know.

1029

(THE ACCOUNTANT CLEARS THROAT)

你会让他做这件事吗?
would you have let him do it?

I did, but if he puts me back in that hole,
I'll still get out.

如果你错误的让别人拿枪指着你的头
If you make one wrong move with the gun to your head
