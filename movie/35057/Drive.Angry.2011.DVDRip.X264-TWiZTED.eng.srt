THE ACCOUNTANT: Since the birth of time,

3
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:40,149
humanity has endeavored
to restrain evil men in prisons.

4
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,648
But since Cain fled
the murder of his brother,

5
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:45,052
evil men have fled the walls of punishment.

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,656
So, it doesn't matter
if you're a badass motherfucker on the run,

7
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:51,922
because you think
you're better than everyone else,

8
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:55,522
and somehow entitled
to do what you gotta do.

9
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:57,396
No.

10
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:01,334
Because, you see, badass motherfuckers
are never fast enough.

11
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:06,733
In the end, they will all be accounted for.

-You see him?

15
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,199

-I swear she said he was dead.

-(LAUGHING)

56

So, he bought you a diamond?

Oh, God, no.
If Frank had money for a diamond,

I would have jacked his sorry ass ages ago
and put this shit hole in rear view.

65
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:31,299

480
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,483
Because you're obnoxious, first,

481
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:02,853
and because I have something I gotta do.

482
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,285
(LAUGHS) Well, then you should've done it
a long time ago.

483
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,387
I didn't have to do it a long time ago, did I?

484
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:12,229
Oh, Milton, I will kill that pretty little woman
in the backseat to get to you.

485
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,894
You think you're Loki, huh?

486
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,801
You think you're Baron Samedi?

487
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:18,469
-I won't allow that.
-Again,

488
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:21,236
what makes you think you have a choice?

489
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,710

Piper, wait!

493
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,938
He ain't one of them
that killed your daughter, was he?

494
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,273
He's someone else.

495
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,975
Anyone not trying to kill you?

496
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,147
MILTON: No.

497
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:41,015
What kind of fucking gun is that?

498
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:43,957
The kind you use on guys like that.

499
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:46,494
I need to reload. You drive.

500
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,827
God damn it.

501
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:02,743
You. You! You can't be here.

502
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,612
-Rookie!
-Sarge, this old joke,

503
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:06,113
he can't stomp around the crime scene.

504
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,108
Captain, sorry about that.

505
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:11,310
Sarge, you'd better get this guy
out of here right now.

506
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,717
Cap, he's green, that's all.

507
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:15,781
Standing on evidence is what he's doing.

508

-Bag them and tag them.
-Yes, sir.

510
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:24,725
Hey, Sarge. Tag these.

511
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:27,060
Why do we have
two dead Colorado troopers

512
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:30,264
within our great state of Oklahoma?

513
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:36,844
And how did these gentlemen come to be
on the wrong end of a disagreement?

514
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:42,340
The guest in this room, John Milton,
I take it he's not among the departed?

515
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:44,943
-No, sir.
-TROOPER: Cap, we got a live one.

516
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:48,855
CAP: I want roadblocks, Sarge.
All over the state. You know the drill.

517
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:56,127
Get me a blanket
and get a medic in here, too.

518
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,461
You're gonna be okay now.

519
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:59,501
We was fucking.

520
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,133
He killed him while we was fucking!

521
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:08,134
-Who did?
-No, you don't understand.

522
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:11,403
It's never happened to me before,
you know?

523
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:12,912
(SNIFFING)

524
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,149
Has it ever happened to you?

00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:32,898
you think there's anybody in there?

528
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:36,796
I guess.

529
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:38,737
The doors are still closed.

You almost fucking killed me, man.

534
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:59,686
Not even close.

535
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:03,060
I won't see you again until you're 73.

536
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:06,295
You, I'll see in three months.

537

TEEN: Hey, what does that mean?

538
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,806
MILTON: My daughter got mixed up with King
straight out of college.

539
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,402
PIPER: She knew him? She knew Jonah King?

540
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:20,108
She knew him, yes, yes, she did.

541
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:23,547
Her world was in a tailspin,

542
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:26,588
and King was preaching quiet revolution.

543
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:30,090
It was four months before she realized
"quiet" meant hiding

544
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,524
in a basement,
cutting the heads off of chickens.

545
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,426
Jonah King's into voodoo?

546
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,361
Not voodoo, satanic magic.

547
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:38,894
He was recruiting for
his own personal Armageddon.

548
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,132
Understandably, my daughter wanted out.

549
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,896
When she told him she was leaving,

550
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:46,006
he broke her leg in three places
with a tire iron.

551
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,104
Jesus.

552
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:50,341
She learned her lesson,

553
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:53,438
was a good little follower for 18 months,
then one night,

554
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:57,018
she got Jonah alone
and stabbed him in his face

555
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:58,347
with a pentagram pendant,

556
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,752
and vanished into the darkness.

557
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:03,053
Milton, your daughter was
in a cult for two years,

558
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:05,616
and you didn't even know about it?

559
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:07,423
I mean, why didn't you help her before?

560
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:10,892
I didn't find out about any of this until...

561
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,291
Until after I got locked up.

562
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,871
You're not gonna reload?

563
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,498

00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:23,606

All I know about you is

584
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:21,261
you abandoned your daughter.

No, Milton.

hand over this child to you.

watch you gurgle,

bleeds its corrupt soul at our feet.

And soon, the hounds of perdition
will howl at our command!
