1
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:36,661
Since the birth of time,

2
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:41,165
humanity has endeavored
to restrain evil men in prisons.

3
00:00:41,415 --> 00:00:43,668
But since Cain fled
the murder of his brother,

4
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:46,045
evil men have fled the walls of punishment.

5
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,675
So, it doesn't matter
if you're a badass motherfucker on the run,

6
00:00:50,758 --> 00:00:52,927
because you think
you're better than everyone else,

7
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,514
and somehow entitled
to do what you gotta do.

8
00:00:57,139 --> 00:00:58,391
No.

9
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,353
Because, you see, badass motherfuckers
are never fast enough.

10
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,733
In the end, they will all be accounted for.

11
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,714
Son of a bitch! Came out of nowhere.

12
00:01:29,797 --> 00:01:32,049
-Didn't she say he was dead?
-You see him?

13
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,219
-I think we lost him.
-I swear she said he was dead.

14
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,637
-Keep watching!
-Well, fucking he ain't!

15
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:41,601
-Drive the fucking car!
-I'm driving the goddamn car!

16
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,230
I don't see him.

17
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,611
He knows.
He knows what we did to her.

18
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:54,030
He knows! He's gonna make us pay!

19
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,910
-Shit! Shit! Shit!
-I think we lost him.

20
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,185
I ain't never telling you
where they've taken her. Never.

21
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,145
I know.

22
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,654
You took my leg, you fuck!

23
00:03:19,448 --> 00:03:20,700
I'm sorry, man.

24
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,118
Where is she?

25
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,287
-I don't know, man.
-Where is the baby girl?

26
00:03:24,328 --> 00:03:25,788
I don't know, man.

27
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,833
I don't know.

28
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:33,421
Stillwater! Hey! Hey!

29
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:37,633
Okay, Deacon's Tree, man. Stillwater Marsh!

30
00:03:37,758 --> 00:03:39,719
Texas, I think.

31
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,889
You're too late. You gotta know that, right?

32
00:03:43,764 --> 00:03:46,350
First full moon, she's dead, man.

33
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,771
She's dead and hell's
gonna walk the motherfucking earth.

34
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,360
Hell already is walking the earth.

35
00:03:56,444 --> 00:04:01,866
You tell him I'm coming.
Tell him I'm coming to get her back.

36
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:25,389
Raise a little hell, raise a little hell
Raise a little hell

37
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:32,522
Raise a little hell, raise a little hell
Raise a little hell

38
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:48,037
So, I tell him, I says, "Frank, that's it.
No more free milk.

39
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,081
"You gonna have to buy the cow,
you son of a bitch."

40
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,874
But you are not fat, Piper.

41
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:56,712
What? No, Norma Jean. "Buy the cow."
Marry me.

42
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,382
I'm saying he's gotta marry me.
I cut him off.

43
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:01,425
You cut him off?

44
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,846
Not just yes, but hell, yes!

45
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:08,182
No tits, no ass, and I told him,

46
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,393
"If I see that big ol' dick
anywhere near my face again,

47
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,020
-"I'm gonna bite it in half."
-You said that?

48
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,814
Yeah, sure did.

49
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,984
Oh, my God. How long has it been?

50
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:22,029
Oh, two days. But that's like a decade
in horny fucker years.

51
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,656
So, he bought you a diamond?

52
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:25,616
Oh, God, no.
If Frank had money for a diamond,

53
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:29,161
I would have jacked his sorry ass ages ago
and put this shit hole in rear view.

54
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:32,290
But he did get down on one knee
and ask me to be his bride.

55
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,916
-No way! Oh!
-Yes, way!

56
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,627
Honey!

57
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,629
Come on, come on!

58
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,756
You think I pay you bitches
to stand around and yap?

59
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,260
Get the fuck back to work.

60
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:47,597
Sit on it, baby.

61
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:54,145
Hi, guys. I'm Piper.
Can I get you something to drink?

62
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,105
We'll take this.

63
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,026
"She's a Brickhouse" breakfast.
Ten monster flapjacks for $4.99.

64
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,069
-And three waters.
-All right, and what can I get for...

65
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:05,239
That's it. Just the pancakes, if that's okay.

66
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,908
Okay, coming right up.

67
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,036
Lou, one Brickhouse!

68
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,331
Hello, beautiful. Coffee?

69
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,959
Black, with sugar.

70
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:24,467
Have you ever heard of a Stillwater Marsh
or a Deacon's Tree? In Texas, maybe?

71
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,761
Stillwater Marsh, yeah, I've heard of it,

72
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,679
but it ain't in Texas.

73
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,556
Stillwater is in Louisiana.

74
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,183
Small town?

75
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:35,394
Honey, Stillwater is a prison.

76
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,439
My daddy did some time there
before it closed.

77
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,400
I'll get you that coffee.

78
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,446
Here's some muffins and warm milk.

79
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,406
-But we didn't order...
-it's on the house.

80
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:55,873
So, you gonna ask me
what time my shift ends?

81
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,209
It's a full moon tonight.

82
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,711
I always feel a little randy with a full moon.

83
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,172
Full moon's two days off.

84
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,132
You sure about that, sweetie?

85
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,182
Pretty sure.

86
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:17,103
Now, that's a hell of a ride out there.
Is that yours?

87
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,438
The Charger? I wish.

88
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,315
Is it hers?

89
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,733
All right, here are them waters.

90
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,069
I'll be right back with the flapjacks.

91
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,323
Sure. But if you're looking for a ride...

92
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,546
I told you I wanted sugar.

93
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,595
On the house? On the fucking house?

94
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,681
Relax. We gonna
throw them muffins out, anyway.

95
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:59,604
If they're not gonna pay for them,
somebody's gonna have to pay the price.

96
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:06,277
I told you, you fat fuck son of a bitch,
never touch me like that again.

97
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,946
-Let go of my balls.
-Shut up.

98
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,035
Muffins are on me. I quit.

99
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,916
Put some honey butter on them muffins.
They'll taste an awful lot better that way.

100
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:49,737
 Sucking on my titties
like you wanted me, calling me all the time

101
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,574
Like Blondie, check out my Chrissy behind
It's fine all of the time

102
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:57,328
What else is in the teaches
of Peaches, huh?

103
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,663
What?

104
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,958
Fuck the pain away
Fuck the pain away

105
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,960
Fuck the pain away

106
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:07,380
Fuck the pain away
Fuck the pain away

107
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:11,175
Fuck the pain away
Fuck the pain away

108
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,635
Fuck the pain away

109
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,679
Oh! Motherfuck!

110
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,209
Now, that's not so bad.

111
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,752
I can fix that if you'd like.

112
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,466
I would. Thank you.

113
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,385
If you give me a lift.

114
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:01,684
I'm only going as far as Blackfoot Falls.
The truck stop there.

115
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,478
I'd be much obliged.

116
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,611
Thank you.

117
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,949
Just so you know,

118
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,576
I don't pick up hitchhikers.

119
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,162
I didn't have my thumb out.

120
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,787
Need some help there?

121
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,259
You, fat fuck. Come here.

122
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:22,265
What'd you call me?
What did you just call me?

123
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,809
I called you "fat fuck."
And we had better leave it at that.

124
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:29,272
Unless you'd prefer I call you
"dead fat fuck."

125
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,815
What?

126
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,027
I'm looking for someone.
Maybe 40 or so, 6'1",

127
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,905
probably looked out of place.

128
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,163
Ah!

129
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,750
He was here earlier. Traveling light.

130
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,963
-Likely on foot.
-Who are you?

131
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,007
I'm The Accountant.

132
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,466
That supposed to mean something to me?

133
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:02,972
It will if I add you to the books.
And if you don't tell me what I want to know.

134
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:11,564
You had something to say?

135
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,775
He was here. Earlier.

136
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:20,031
-Where did he go?
-That way.

137
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,700
On foot.

138
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,194
I appreciate the ride.

139
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,447
You all right?

140
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:08,412
Yeah. I mean, I quit my job. Again.

141
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,582
But this time it's different 'cause...

142
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:15,002
I don't know, my man's out of work
and we just got engaged.

143
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,588
Is he a good man?

144
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,425
Yeah.

145
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:27,098
Yeah, he is. I mean,
I guess you can just tell these things.

146
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,713
-No, no, no. Fuck!
-Baby, I'm fucking you all right.

147
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,132
-Yeah.
-No fucking...

148
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,427
What the hell do you think
you're doing? Psycho bitch.

149
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,805
Piper, Piper, I can explain.
She was just showing me something.

150
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,557
Get out! Don't.

151
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,894
Fuck you, Piper. We're in...

152
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:15,938
I didn't quite hear what you said!

153
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,943
I said, "We're in..."

154
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,858
You made me cheat on you.
This is your fault.

155
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,568
-Would you...
-Hey!

156
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:03,903
Piper, stop!

157
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,821
You've got nowhere else to go,
and you know it.

158
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,409
Oh, baby. You don't think
I can find a guy better than you in Florida?

159
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,703
Florida? Hell, no. Texas? Maybe.

160
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,038
We'll see about that.

161
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,582
No, no, no. You're not taking my car.

162
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,418
You're not taking my car, bitch!

163
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,548
Your car? Who's been making the payments,

164
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,676
you out of work,
skanky, Mona-fucking piece of shit?

165
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,225
You're insane, woman.

166
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,979
Look what you made me do! Come on.
I'll get you some ice.

167
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,577
Frank, sweetie.

168
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:58,416
I'm gonna tell everybody
what I caught you doing with my pink dildo.

169
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,754
You don't wanna be with me?

170
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:09,093
Fine. When I'm done,
nobody's gonna wanna be with you, ever.

171
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,554
-Go to hell.
-Ha!

172
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:12,972
Hey.

173
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,981
I am one with the darkness.

174
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,484
I am one with the darkness.
I am one with the darkness.

175
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,444
It bums through me.

176
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,864
It bums through me. Now to you.

177
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,242
...forge our bond together.

178
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,160
And offer the sacrifice

179
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,251
that will set us all free.

180
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,508
We will walk through
the valley of the shadow of death.

181
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,843
No!

182
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,388
No! Please, don't take my baby.

183
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,223
And only through...

184
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,020
-Give me the baby.
-No!

185
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,566
You want me to roll up the window?

186
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,531
No.

187
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:44,707
You can use my jacket if you're cold.

188
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,792
Thank you.

189
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,464
You didn't kill him, did you?

190
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,009
Your fiancé? No.

191
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,802
Thanks for that.

192
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:58,971
Are you hungry?

193
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,141
I could use a drink.

194
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,855
Oklahoma?

195
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,857
Mmm-hmm.

196
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,192
You mentioned Florida.

197
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:16,906
My business is in Louisiana.
Can you get me that far?

198
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,743
-What business?
-I'm looking for someone.

199
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,037
I'm Milton.

200
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,039
You're Piper, right?

201
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:30,169
Well, Milton, if you try and kill me
and dump me in the woods,

202
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:33,005
I'm gonna cut your nuts off.

203
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,174
Yes, ma'am.

204
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,302
All right, then.

205
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:54,735
All the planes have been grounded

206
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,828
Greetings, folks.
Welcome to the Bull By The Balls.

207
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,330
Roy.

208
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,374
Milton.

209
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,709
Thought you were dead.

210
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,461
You hoped I was dead. Not the same.

211
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,173
You planning on staying?

212
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,591
You got a problem with that?

213
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,218
Your money's good as any, I expect.

214
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,846
But be gone by dawn.

215
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:30,730
That goes by the name of the sandman

216
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:34,483
What was that all about?

217
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:37,278
In another life, I used to drive a truck
through these parts.

218
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,574
I'd enjoy a visit with his sister.

219
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,870
-And he took offense?
-Yes.

220
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:49,040
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

221
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,875
-You sure?
-Howdy.

222
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,668
I'm Candy.

223
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,420
Start you off with some drinks?

224
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:55,755
-Beer.
-Same.

225
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,715
I need to see some IDs, too.

226
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,258
What the hell is this?

227
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,636
Guess it's been a while
since you did that visiting.

228
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:04,889
You want a drink? You gotta be a member.
Dry county.

229
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,435
Oh, shit. Sorry.

230
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,730
-That was in my pocket.
-Don't look at me like I'm some sort of thief.

231
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,065
I lifted it for protection.

232
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,025
If you stole my ride,

233
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,194
I was gonna have to hunt you down.

234
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,197
Did she say something funny?

235
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:23,991
Yeah, this license isn't just expired,
it's antique.

236
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:28,871
All right, then bring me a black coffee
with sugar.

237
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,957
Aw! Now, now, now. For you, handsome,

238
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,086
I don't know,
I think maybe I can bend the rules a bit.

239
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,129
Don't tell nobody.

240
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,594
You gonna tap that or what?

241
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:45,513
Tap?

242
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,723
Geez, Milton, how long has it been?

243
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,767
I've had a lot on my mind.

244
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:53,604
Uh-huh. Right. Suit yourself then.

245
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:57,108
But no one ever reaches the end and says,
"l wish I hadn't fucked so much."

246
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,526
Where you going?

247
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:01,445
I'm going to take a shower,
lie in a warm bed,

248
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,200
-do my nails.
-What about your beer?

249
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,202
You drink it. I'll see you at dawn.

250
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,751
Here you go, big boy.

251
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:20,423
Like an eagle in the eye
of a hurricane that's abandoned

252
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:21,883
Get you a drink, friend?

253
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,217
It's a nice place you got.

254
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,553
You rent that out for parties here?

255
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:28,222
We sure do. You planning a party?

256
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:31,809
Yeah. I'm planning on having
one of them tonight.

257
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,983
Reverend Jonah King,
the self-proclaimed prophet...

258
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:40,234
Mom, Mom, look, it's over.

259
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,652
Piper's gone. I just want my car back.

260
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:45,239
-Look, I gotta go. Cops are here.
-...are wanted for questioning...

261
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,783
-I love you, too.
-...in the brutal murder of the young parents.

262
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:50,203
About fucking time.

263
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,747
-I called you guys like...
-There was a traveler.

264
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:55,041
-6'1".
-What?

265
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,877
Ah! Yes, the traveler.

266
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:01,172
Angry with attitude.

267
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,674
Sumbitch kicked me in the... Who are you?

268
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:05,510
-I'm The Accountant.
-The...

269
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,053
I called a cop.

270
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,721
The "sumbitch,"

271
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:10,681
where did he go?

272
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:12,892
Fuck should I know?
I woke up and all three were gone.

273
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:15,728
-All three?
-The bitch, the sumbitch

274
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,688
-and my car!
-What kind of car?

275
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,149
Look, Hugo Boss,

276
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:23,277
you ain't no cop, me ain't no talking.

277
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:31,452
Two sumbitches in one day?
You leave me no choice.

278
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:37,542
I'm gonna take this stick from Kentucky
and beat your ass with it.

279
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,053
-What kind of car, Frank?
-What?

280
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:50,680
Your car, what kind is it?

281
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,057
Why does everyone keep hurting me?

282
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:55,893
Answer. The.

283
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:58,604
Question.

284
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:02,191
'69 Charger, you fuck.

285
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:03,609
440 or the Hemi?

286
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,194
440.

287
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:13,995
Wait, wait, wait. Get me off this wall.
Please. No!

288
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:17,665
Where you going?
Please, get me off the wall.

289
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:20,168
Hey, fuck tard, that's mine.

290
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:21,502
Shithead, shithead, that's...

291
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:31,929
-You call about a stolen car?
-Frank Raimi?

292
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:34,724
In there.

293
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:39,228
I'm looking for someone.
6'1", not from around here.

294
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,563
He's driving a '69 Charger.

295
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,440
He's traveling with her.

296
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,074
Jesus.

297
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,329
-Excuse me?
-Keep your hands where I can see them.

298
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:58,331
Show me your hands, asshole.

299
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,129
-This is your lucky day.
-What's the matter...

300
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:19,018
You're...

301
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,938
You're a Fed?

302
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:25,483
I'm in pursuit of a traveler.
John, John Milton.

303
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:27,818
He's with the girl in this photo.

304
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:31,656
-But the guy in the room, he's...
-Dead. Yes.

305
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:34,492
I'd say it's unfortunate, but I'd be lying.

306
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:35,785
Only his mother will miss him.

307
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,247
Look, Troopers, I need your help
with my pursuit of this fugitive.

308
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,041
If we three could apprehend him...

309
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:46,254
-You are ambitious.
-I guess.

310
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:48,339
Yes, we are.

311
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,550
I can tell that you are.

312
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:53,761
Success will mean promotion, pay raise.
I guaran-fucking-tee it.

313
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:55,847
Now, we are going to hunt this Milton.

314
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:57,932
We are going to find the Charger
that he's driving

315
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:01,686
and when we find him,
you will shoot to kill.

316
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,646
Shoot to kill.

317
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:06,566
That's against protocol.

318
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:12,154
Yeah. This man is highly dangerous.

319
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:16,200
He has killed. He will kill again.
He must be taken down on sight.

320
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,661
The time it takes you to
follow your protocols,

321
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,830
that's the time it takes him to end your life.

322
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:27,795
Shall we?

323
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:33,384
Come on.

324
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,929
-Oh! Fuck, yeah!
-Um, are we gonna do it?

325
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:39,307
Depends on how well you do those nails.

326
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,725
Oh!

327
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,352
See, you gotta be careful.
You're gonna have to redo that one.

328
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:46,898
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, my God!

329
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:57,533
Sorry. Shut the fuck up in there! Come on!
Shut the fuck up!

330
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:06,959
Move it. You can move that cock.

331
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:12,924
Oh! God damn it.

332
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:15,718
Sorry about that.

333
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:20,264
Come on. Come on, move it.

334
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:26,187
Hang on.

335
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:43,579
 ...March 15th,
in a dumpster behind a local strip club.

336
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:46,666
The case is set to go to trial
in February of 2011.

337
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,376
In other news tonight,

338
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:52,505
new details are emerging
in the case of a missing Colorado infant.

339
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:55,842
Investigators, in cooperation with
the Colorado state police,

340
00:27:56,008 --> 00:28:00,221
have issued an all points bulletin
for Jonah King's immediate detention

341
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:04,267
in connection with the murders of a young
married couple in Loveland, Colorado.

342
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:09,021
Their infant girl is believed to have been
abducted by this religious sect.

343
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:12,149
A nationwide Amber Alert
is now in full effect.

344
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:16,112
You may recall we broke the story first
that the young mother...

345
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,454
Investigators refuse to comment.

346
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,374
Although, our own Nathan Brown
has recently learned...

347
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,293
Look at that handsome devil.

348
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:36,382
Fools do not know how blessed they are
to look upon the messiah of the next age.

349
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:54,025
The girl is in 11. And Milton,

350
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:55,568
he in number 12.

351
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:03,326
This Milton is no friend to us.

352
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:07,330
He will try and keep us
from what we are rightfully owed.

353
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:08,664
He is the blight,

354
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:10,166
and we are the rain.

355
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:14,295
Go forth and pour your anger upon him.

356
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:21,404
Oh, yeah.

357
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:24,323
Oh, baby. Why don't you fuck naked?

358
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:26,909
I never disrobe before a gunfight.

359
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:28,327
Oh, yeah.

360
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:31,581
I know that you want the candy

361
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:34,792
I know that you want the candy

362
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:37,879
I know that you want the candy

363
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,590
I know that you want the candy

364
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:43,259
Gimme candy I've never had

365
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:46,679
Tastes so sweet, makes good love bad

366
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:52,018
Fallen out with my love

367
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:55,146
A grievous time to pass

368
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:57,815
Sugar done break my heart

369
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:01,319
A heart not meant to last

370
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:04,155
In spite of saddened days...

371
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:08,951
Come on, baby. Don't be shy.

372
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,335
That baby is as good as dead.

373
00:31:22,757 --> 00:31:24,717
Oh, fuck yeah!

374
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:30,056
Shit! Shit!

375
00:31:32,016 --> 00:31:35,603
Fuck him, motherfucker! Fuck him.
Who's a punk-ass motherfucker?

376
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:57,625
I know that you want the candy

377
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:00,670
I know that you want the candy

378
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:03,714
I know that you want the candy

379
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:09,971
I know that you want the candy

380
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:13,057
I know that you want the candy

381
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:15,726
I know that you want the candy

382
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:18,604
Gimme candy I've never had

383
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:21,649
Gimme candy I've never had

384
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:24,235
Tastes so sweet, makes good love bad

385
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:56,517
oh, hen.

386
00:32:58,186 --> 00:32:59,437
Would you calm down?

387
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:05,818
He definitely took the bait.

388
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:10,490
-You know these people?
-We should hurry. There are probably more.

389
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:25,630
Look, there's Jonah King.

390
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:29,133
Troopers, remember why we're here.

391
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:44,649
Milton.

392
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:48,569
Milton, you owe me some answers.

393
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:54,534
It's him.

394
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:56,786
Freeze!

395
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:20,560
Milton! Fuck!

396
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:23,271
Promotion and pay raise.
Promotion and pay raise.

397
00:34:23,354 --> 00:34:24,730
Get down!

398
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:38,035
Drop in

399
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:41,372
-No!
-You sorry mother...

400
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:44,041
Fuck you! Die, you...

401
00:35:01,642 --> 00:35:02,852
Oh, my God.

402
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:04,896
-Milton, what are you doing?
-I'm going after him.

403
00:35:04,979 --> 00:35:07,356
Why? You wanna join me?

404
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,893
Bleeding's almost stopped.

405
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,436
It's just a graze.

406
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,522
Milton, those cops shot at us
with no warning.

407
00:35:48,356 --> 00:35:51,484
They weren't trying to arrest us,
they were trying to kill us.

408
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:54,153
They were trying to kill you.

409
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:59,450
What, are you a murderer?
You escape from prison or something?

410
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:01,953
-Go on, what is it?
-Both.

411
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:04,956
Jesus, what have I done?

412
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,084
What have you fucking got me in to?
Milton, I shot a cop!

413
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:11,838
I'm gonna go to jail!
Do you understand that? Fuck!

414
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,925
Give me one good reason
I shouldn't shoot you in the face.

415
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,927
I'm driving.

416
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:20,304
You know what I mean!

417
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:23,224
Fuck!

418
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:27,603
They took her baby.

419
00:36:30,273 --> 00:36:31,649
They took her little girl.

420
00:36:33,317 --> 00:36:34,777
The little girl on the news?

421
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:37,989
-The little baby everyone's looking for?
-Yes.

422
00:36:38,072 --> 00:36:40,825
They killed my daughter.
They took her baby.

423
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:49,834
That baby girl is all I got.

424
00:36:51,669 --> 00:36:54,505
She's the last connection to my daughter.

425
00:36:55,798 --> 00:36:57,383
I am going to get her back.

426
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:04,348
Shotgun. it's already loaded.

427
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:16,861
Roll it down.

428
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:24,035
Now!

429
00:37:29,165 --> 00:37:30,541
Get the other gun ready.

430
00:37:33,461 --> 00:37:36,214
No, no, no. The old one.
The big one in the case, have it ready.

431
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,857
It's...

432
00:37:54,982 --> 00:37:56,609
It's over, Milton. Stop the car.

433
00:37:57,151 --> 00:37:59,111
-I can't do that!
-Really?

434
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:00,738
What makes you think you have a choice?

435
00:38:00,822 --> 00:38:02,490
Because you're obnoxious, first,

436
00:38:02,573 --> 00:38:03,866
and because I have something I gotta do.

437
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:07,286
Well, then you should've done it
a long time ago.

438
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:09,372
I didn't have to do it a long time ago, did I?

439
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:13,209
Oh, Milton, I will kill that pretty little woman
in the backseat to get to you.

440
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:14,877
You think you're Loki, huh?

441
00:38:14,961 --> 00:38:16,796
You think you're Baron Samedi?

442
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:19,465
-I won't allow that.
-Again,

443
00:38:19,549 --> 00:38:22,218
what makes you think you have a choice?

444
00:38:24,053 --> 00:38:25,388
This does.

445
00:39:10,892 --> 00:39:12,226
Piper, wait!

446
00:39:29,827 --> 00:39:31,954
He ain't one of them
that killed your daughter, was he?

447
00:39:32,205 --> 00:39:34,290
He's someone else.

448
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:35,958
Anyone not trying to kill you?

449
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:38,127
No.

450
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,006
What kind of fucking gun is that?

451
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:44,967
The kind you use on guys like that.

452
00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:47,512
I need to reload. You drive.

453
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:51,807
God damn it.

454
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:03,736
You. You! You can't be here.

455
00:40:04,153 --> 00:40:05,613
-Rookie!
-Sarge, this old joke,

456
00:40:05,655 --> 00:40:07,114
he can't stomp around the crime scene.

457
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,116
Captain, sorry about that.

458
00:40:09,784 --> 00:40:12,328
Sarge, you'd better get this guy
out of here right now.

459
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:13,704
Cap, he's green, that's all.

460
00:40:13,788 --> 00:40:16,791
Standing on evidence is what he's doing.

461
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:18,334
.45s.

462
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:23,047
-Bag them and tag them.
-Yes, sir.

463
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:25,716
Hey, Sarge. Tag these.

464
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:28,052
Why do we have
two dead Colorado troopers

465
00:40:28,177 --> 00:40:31,264
within our great state of Oklahoma?

466
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:37,854
And how did these gentlemen come to be
on the wrong end of a disagreement?

467
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:43,359
The guest in this room, John Milton,
I take it he's not among the departed?

468
00:40:43,401 --> 00:40:45,945
-No, sir.
-Cap, we got a live one.

469
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:49,866
I want roadblocks, Sarge.
All over the state. You know the drill.

470
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:57,123
Get me a blanket
and get a medic in here, too.

471
00:40:57,206 --> 00:40:58,457
You're gonna be okay now.

472
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:00,501
We was fucking.

473
00:41:03,963 --> 00:41:06,132
He killed him while we was fucking!

474
00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:09,135
-Who did?
-No, you don't understand.

475
00:41:09,385 --> 00:41:12,388
It's never happened to me before,
you know?

476
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:18,144
Has it ever happened to you?

477
00:41:20,396 --> 00:41:22,565
Let's get a shrink in here, too.

478
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:31,491
Dude,

479
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:33,910
you think there's anybody in there?

480
00:41:36,204 --> 00:41:37,788
I guess.

481
00:41:38,414 --> 00:41:39,749
The doors are still closed.

482
00:41:47,882 --> 00:41:49,842
-Jesus...
-Carpenter.

483
00:41:49,926 --> 00:41:53,012
And despite what you've heard,
prefers short hair.

484
00:41:56,933 --> 00:41:58,476
You almost fucking killed me, man.

485
00:41:58,601 --> 00:42:00,686
Not even close.

486
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:04,065
I won't see you again until you're 73.

487
00:42:05,066 --> 00:42:07,276
You, I'll see in three months.

488
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:11,906
Hey, what does that mean?

489
00:42:12,532 --> 00:42:15,827
My daughter got mixed up with King
straight out of college.

490
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:18,412
She knew him? She knew Jonah King?

491
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:21,123
She knew him, yes, yes, she did.

492
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:24,544
Her world was in a tailspin,

493
00:42:24,627 --> 00:42:27,588
and King was preaching quiet revolution.

494
00:42:27,672 --> 00:42:31,092
It was four months before she realized
"quiet" meant hiding

495
00:42:31,175 --> 00:42:33,511
in a basement,
cutting the heads off of chickens.

496
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:35,429
Jonah King's into voodoo?

497
00:42:35,513 --> 00:42:37,348
Not voodoo, satanic magic.

498
00:42:37,682 --> 00:42:39,892
He was recruiting for
his own personal Armageddon.

499
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:42,144
Understandably, my daughter wanted out.

500
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:43,896
When she told him she was leaving,

501
00:42:44,146 --> 00:42:47,024
he broke her leg in three places
with a tire iron.

502
00:42:47,817 --> 00:42:49,110
Jesus.

503
00:42:49,527 --> 00:42:51,320
She learned her lesson,

504
00:42:51,445 --> 00:42:54,448
was a good little follower for 18 months,
then one night,

505
00:42:55,074 --> 00:42:58,035
she got Jonah alone
and stabbed him in his face

506
00:42:58,119 --> 00:42:59,328
with a pentagram pendant,

507
00:42:59,912 --> 00:43:01,747
and vanished into the darkness.

508
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:04,041
Milton, your daughter was
in a cult for two years,

509
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:06,627
and you didn't even know about it?

510
00:43:06,711 --> 00:43:08,421
I mean, why didn't you help her before?

511
00:43:08,713 --> 00:43:11,883
I didn't find out about any of this until...

512
00:43:12,758 --> 00:43:14,302
Until after I got locked up.

513
00:43:15,928 --> 00:43:17,889
You're not gonna reload?

514
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:20,516
Only three bullets to begin.

515
00:43:20,683 --> 00:43:23,060
Milton, that's his van.

516
00:43:23,352 --> 00:43:24,604
Pull over.

517
00:43:43,331 --> 00:43:44,832
Stay here.

518
00:43:51,464 --> 00:43:58,179
Each little flower that opens
Each little bird that sings

519
00:43:58,471 --> 00:44:04,560
All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small

520
00:44:04,727 --> 00:44:10,817
All things wise and wonderful
The Lord God made them all

521
00:44:11,484 --> 00:44:13,903
All things bright and beautiful

522
00:44:15,404 --> 00:44:17,615
All creatures great and small

523
00:44:22,912 --> 00:44:26,040
Man, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

524
00:44:27,542 --> 00:44:29,919
Let her go and give me the child.

525
00:44:30,711 --> 00:44:32,964
Or I'll blow all your heads off.

526
00:44:34,632 --> 00:44:38,052
Drop it. Or we will gut her.

527
00:44:38,636 --> 00:44:41,973
Your choice, sugar. But either way, we win.

528
00:44:42,014 --> 00:44:43,683
We don't play, boy.

529
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,490
Milton, isn't it?

530
00:45:01,242 --> 00:45:02,451
Why you here?

531
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,705
-Why you making such a fuss?
-You know why I'm here.

532
00:45:16,174 --> 00:45:18,467
All I know about you is

533
00:45:19,844 --> 00:45:22,263
you abandoned your daughter.

534
00:45:24,557 --> 00:45:27,518
Crushed her so completely,
she told everyone you were dead.

535
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:30,188
No, Milton.

536
00:45:33,816 --> 00:45:36,486
I cannot, in good faith,
hand over this child to you.

537
00:45:36,527 --> 00:45:39,780
But sacrificing her under the full moon
is okay?

538
00:45:40,823 --> 00:45:43,993
This child is unbelievably blessed.

539
00:45:44,619 --> 00:45:47,205
Look around you. World is on fire.

540
00:45:48,664 --> 00:45:50,958
People are suffering.

541
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,336
And they will continue to suffer
until change comes.

542
00:45:53,419 --> 00:45:55,338
Yeah, go ahead and laugh, boy.

543
00:45:55,963 --> 00:45:57,340
Change is gonna come.

544
00:45:58,466 --> 00:46:00,301
Thanks to your lineage.

545
00:46:01,177 --> 00:46:05,431
This child will open the door to a new

546
00:46:05,515 --> 00:46:07,141
world order.

547
00:46:07,225 --> 00:46:13,272
The charlatan murders my daughter
and then feeds me his philosophy.

548
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:19,737
Your daughter's death was an accident.

549
00:46:20,363 --> 00:46:22,532
I saw the whole thing.

550
00:46:23,032 --> 00:46:26,369
I saw who you are when no one's looking.

551
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:28,913
And I saw what that night cost you.

552
00:46:29,747 --> 00:46:31,040
Milton,

553
00:46:31,624 --> 00:46:33,376
you're embarrassing yourself.

554
00:46:33,459 --> 00:46:36,629
You forced my daughter on her knees,

555
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,006
and she made you pay for it.

556
00:46:41,008 --> 00:46:43,010
Isn't that right, Leather Jacket?

557
00:46:43,094 --> 00:46:44,345
You were there.

558
00:46:45,596 --> 00:46:48,140
Dickless made you swear not to tell anyone.

559
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:50,810
Yo, John.

560
00:46:53,563 --> 00:46:55,606
Give me the child.

561
00:46:58,985 --> 00:47:00,444
Give me the child.

562
00:47:02,405 --> 00:47:04,824
I said, give me the child.

563
00:47:11,789 --> 00:47:13,082
No!

564
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,590
Back off!

565
00:47:25,595 --> 00:47:29,182
My child, it'd be pretty easy for me to
shoot you in the throat,

566
00:47:29,265 --> 00:47:31,601
watch you gurgle,
while I eat my morning grapefruit.

567
00:47:33,144 --> 00:47:35,146
But I don't think so, Piper. You...

568
00:47:35,521 --> 00:47:37,523
You interest me.

569
00:47:38,441 --> 00:47:40,026
I could take your life.

570
00:47:40,109 --> 00:47:42,987
Or I could bestow my blessings upon you.

571
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:47,700
Teach you, like I taught Milton's daughter.

572
00:47:47,783 --> 00:47:49,285
You remind me of her, you know?

573
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,621
So much spirit.

574
00:47:52,663 --> 00:47:54,332
But I broke her.

575
00:47:55,166 --> 00:47:58,044
And I will so enjoy
breaking you the same way.

576
00:48:00,755 --> 00:48:02,381
Let's go for a ride.

577
00:48:02,715 --> 00:48:03,966
Let's go!

578
00:48:04,091 --> 00:48:05,927
No! No!

579
00:48:11,015 --> 00:48:15,019
No! Milton! Milton!

580
00:48:15,645 --> 00:48:18,022
I'll fucking kill you!

581
00:48:20,066 --> 00:48:24,737
Fuck you! Fuck you! Get off me!

582
00:48:26,906 --> 00:48:31,160
No! No!
Fucking get off me, you motherfucker!

583
00:48:34,789 --> 00:48:36,707
This is gonna be fun!

584
00:48:37,834 --> 00:48:41,838
-Feisty bitch! Feisty bitch!
-We're going for a ride, girl.

585
00:48:44,465 --> 00:48:47,009
You see this here femur bone?

586
00:48:47,093 --> 00:48:48,678
That belonged to your daughter.

587
00:48:49,178 --> 00:48:50,930
I keep it with me wherever I go.

588
00:48:57,228 --> 00:49:03,901
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!
Fucking let me go!

589
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:25,047
Next time,
I'll shoot you in your fucking mouth.

590
00:49:33,014 --> 00:49:35,057
Shall we proceed?

591
00:49:47,987 --> 00:49:49,447
We'll bury them out back.

592
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:51,073
Now, get the fucking shovels
out of the truck.

593
00:49:51,157 --> 00:49:53,117
No, you go get the fucking shovels.

594
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,913
Fuck!

595
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:58,831
Go! Go! Down!

596
00:50:16,182 --> 00:50:18,017
How come he ain't dead?

597
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,686
It don't matter. He's gonna be.

598
00:51:35,428 --> 00:51:37,263
Well, look at this.

599
00:51:37,346 --> 00:51:39,182
He's still coming.

600
00:51:39,265 --> 00:51:41,225
-Who's still coming?
-Milton.

601
00:51:41,976 --> 00:51:43,436
-Milton.
-What?

602
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:46,105
-Stay down.
-He's alive.

603
00:51:56,782 --> 00:51:58,868
But you shot him in the face.

604
00:52:02,413 --> 00:52:03,706
Don't you see?

605
00:52:03,748 --> 00:52:05,416
We stand at a crossroads.

606
00:52:05,583 --> 00:52:07,668
Y'all didn't think we could just
kick up our heels,

607
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:09,086
and change the world, did you?

608
00:52:09,253 --> 00:52:10,546
Mmm-mmm.

609
00:52:28,356 --> 00:52:30,942
We got a fight coming. A glorious battle.

610
00:52:35,655 --> 00:52:36,948
He's coming around!

611
00:53:36,424 --> 00:53:38,092
Fuck you!

612
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:13,878
I'm going to kill you, you little bitch!

613
00:54:40,154 --> 00:54:42,198
I've changed my mind about you, Piper.

614
00:54:42,281 --> 00:54:43,950
You are too willful to be taught.

615
00:54:48,704 --> 00:54:49,956
I am going to kill you,

616
00:54:50,039 --> 00:54:52,083
and then I'm going to defile your corpse.

617
00:54:55,711 --> 00:54:57,839
Between now and then,

618
00:54:59,173 --> 00:55:01,217
I'm gonna fuck you up.

619
00:55:05,179 --> 00:55:06,514
Oh, Piper.

620
00:55:29,537 --> 00:55:30,955
Knock her ass out!

621
00:56:02,028 --> 00:56:04,071
You're so willful.

622
00:56:11,204 --> 00:56:12,455
Willful!

623
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,502
Goodbye, sweet Piper.

624
00:57:11,848 --> 00:57:13,099
He's coming right at us!

625
00:57:47,842 --> 00:57:49,051
Piper!

626
00:58:48,402 --> 00:58:51,322
Jesus, Milton. How?

627
00:58:51,948 --> 00:58:53,866
It's still in there.

628
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:57,745
The bullet. I can... I can feel it.

629
00:58:58,913 --> 00:59:00,331
How are you still alive?

630
00:59:02,667 --> 00:59:05,461
We don't have time for this.
They're getting away.

631
00:59:18,432 --> 00:59:19,684
Thought you were dead.

632
00:59:19,809 --> 00:59:21,561
This license isn't just expired,
it's antique.

633
00:59:21,602 --> 00:59:23,271
She told everyone you were dead.

634
00:59:23,896 --> 00:59:25,481
How long were you in prison?

635
00:59:26,941 --> 00:59:28,359
Were you in prison at all?

636
00:59:34,073 --> 00:59:36,325
Jesus, Milton,
has anything you told me been true?

637
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:41,747
I used to know a guy who lived out this way.
You have one of those

638
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:43,833
portable phones?

639
00:59:45,877 --> 00:59:48,588
A cell phone?
You mean a cell phone, Milton?

640
00:59:48,671 --> 00:59:51,674
Yeah, I got a cell phone. it's in my purse.

641
00:59:52,925 --> 00:59:56,012
-You just gonna ignore me?
-I'm gonna try.

642
00:59:57,346 --> 00:59:59,682
We have to hide the car. I'll push, you steer.

643
01:00:00,892 --> 01:00:02,685
Forget about it. Who cares?

644
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:05,605
You should. You killed two cops.

645
01:00:13,821 --> 01:00:19,076
Here we are
Burning up in our cars

646
01:00:20,786 --> 01:00:23,247
And in our hearts

647
01:00:23,289 --> 01:00:29,545
With your tea
Lucky states as the day breaks

648
01:00:30,588 --> 01:00:33,382
The blind are leading the blind

649
01:00:47,897 --> 01:00:50,525
-Scorcher today, huh?
-Help me.

650
01:00:52,693 --> 01:00:55,154
Christ on a cracker. My apologies.

651
01:00:59,534 --> 01:01:00,827
What's that supposed to mean?

652
01:01:00,868 --> 01:01:03,788
It's a symbol of our pact with Lord Satan.

653
01:01:04,288 --> 01:01:05,581
Pact, huh? Ooh!

654
01:01:06,374 --> 01:01:08,292
Funny, he's never mentioned you.

655
01:01:08,584 --> 01:01:12,797
Whoa! Those are fucked.
Here, have some water.

656
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,389
Amateurs.

657
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:25,226
I'm gonna die, ain't I?

658
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:30,231
-Milton's work, I take it.
-Yeah.

659
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:33,276
Son of a bitch shot me!

660
01:01:34,902 --> 01:01:36,612
Wait. How did you...

661
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:39,031
Who are you?

662
01:01:40,158 --> 01:01:41,534
I'm The Accountant.

663
01:01:42,285 --> 01:01:44,954
I'm curious, and I never get curious.

664
01:01:45,496 --> 01:01:48,124
-What do you people want with Milton?
-You're the who?

665
01:01:53,462 --> 01:01:55,965
Does it matter? Milton.
Why is he important to you?

666
01:01:56,048 --> 01:01:59,677
He isn't! He's the one chasing us!

667
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,137
-Why?
-Because...

668
01:02:01,179 --> 01:02:03,931
Because of what we did.
Because of who we took.

669
01:02:04,307 --> 01:02:08,978
Well, color me curious, what did you do?
And who did you take?

670
01:02:12,315 --> 01:02:15,151
Let me know if I hurt you, Milton.

671
01:02:15,276 --> 01:02:17,153
I tried to get her back.

672
01:02:17,987 --> 01:02:19,655
I really did.

673
01:02:19,739 --> 01:02:21,032
I know.

674
01:02:21,616 --> 01:02:25,203
Fucking devil worshippers.
They freak me the fuck out.

675
01:02:25,786 --> 01:02:28,998
Messing with powers they ought not to.
Turns my shit white.

676
01:02:29,081 --> 01:02:30,958
None of it's real.

677
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:36,756
No, Milton. UFOs and Bigfoot and ghosts,
that's bullshit.

678
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:39,509
Devils and demons.

679
01:02:41,177 --> 01:02:44,013
Once you open those doors,
you just can't close them.

680
01:02:44,472 --> 01:02:46,224
But you know that, don't you?

681
01:03:22,009 --> 01:03:26,556
-You're dead.
-Yeah, we've been getting that a lot lately.

682
01:03:26,681 --> 01:03:28,599
No, toots.

683
01:03:29,392 --> 01:03:31,185
I carried his coffin.

684
01:03:31,727 --> 01:03:33,229
Webster,

685
01:03:33,354 --> 01:03:37,567
are you gonna keep stroking that .357,
or you gonna yank it?

686
01:03:37,692 --> 01:03:39,068
That depends.

687
01:03:39,902 --> 01:03:41,696
How is this possible?

688
01:03:41,737 --> 01:03:43,406
You heard about my daughter?

689
01:03:44,532 --> 01:03:45,783
I did.

690
01:03:45,867 --> 01:03:48,536
Then you know why I'm back.

691
01:04:38,419 --> 01:04:39,670
I don't...

692
01:04:40,546 --> 01:04:42,507
Can you explain this, please?

693
01:04:43,799 --> 01:04:45,051
He loved his daughter.

694
01:04:45,468 --> 01:04:48,137
A lot of daddies love their daughters.

695
01:04:50,306 --> 01:04:53,309
But it don't explain shattering reality.

696
01:04:55,353 --> 01:04:58,356
Well, that one loved his little girl
enough to make her hate him.

697
01:04:59,315 --> 01:05:00,817
Uh, he was...

698
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:06,239
He was a bad, bad husband.

699
01:05:07,281 --> 01:05:09,534
But he was a good father.

700
01:05:10,451 --> 01:05:14,205
And then, we went and got mixed up
in the wrong crowd.

701
01:05:14,288 --> 01:05:17,333
And once you are in,
there ain't no getting out.

702
01:05:18,334 --> 01:05:22,630
So, to protect her, he vanished
while she was still in high school.

703
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:24,507
And I went with him.

704
01:05:25,174 --> 01:05:27,552
-But you got out.
-Yeah, I did.

705
01:05:28,052 --> 01:05:32,181
But only 'cause he paid a little visit
to some fellows

706
01:05:33,307 --> 01:05:35,351
who wanted to kill us
when the job was done.

707
01:05:38,896 --> 01:05:43,151
He went alone, you see. I would've gone,

708
01:05:44,485 --> 01:05:46,487
but I didn't know.

709
01:05:48,656 --> 01:05:50,658
I would've gone.

710
01:06:03,421 --> 01:06:06,299
That fire making you homesick?

711
01:06:09,719 --> 01:06:11,137
Cold beer?

712
01:06:12,722 --> 01:06:14,724
Fire isn't the worst part.

713
01:06:15,766 --> 01:06:17,935
It's the video feed.

714
01:06:19,604 --> 01:06:22,273
It's not about your suffering,

715
01:06:22,523 --> 01:06:24,484
your burning.

716
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:29,780
It's about the suffering
of those you love because

717
01:06:29,864 --> 01:06:32,241
that's all you see

718
01:06:33,659 --> 01:06:35,620
in full detail.

719
01:06:37,455 --> 01:06:40,708
And there's nothing you can do
to shut it off.

720
01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:47,632
My daughter was 16 when I got shot.

721
01:06:49,884 --> 01:06:51,886
I watched her weep.

722
01:06:52,303 --> 01:06:54,639
I watched her curse me.

723
01:06:55,139 --> 01:06:59,602
I watched her join that cult.

724
01:07:01,896 --> 01:07:03,731
I watched the murders.

725
01:07:05,942 --> 01:07:11,948
My tree-hugging, sandal-wearing
son-in-law first, and then...

726
01:07:16,077 --> 01:07:18,371
And then my daughter.

727
01:07:21,332 --> 01:07:23,334
Burning is nothing

728
01:07:25,127 --> 01:07:30,883
compared to watching
your child's head being torn off.

729
01:07:37,223 --> 01:07:41,936
Thank you, Webster. I don't believe
I'll be having that beer just now.

730
01:07:44,772 --> 01:07:48,442
Not unless I'm drinking it
from Jonah King's skull.

731
01:07:55,616 --> 01:07:59,620
John, I can't fix that car.

732
01:08:02,874 --> 01:08:06,002
But I can get you where you need to be.

733
01:08:23,686 --> 01:08:27,857
Milton, if memory serves,

734
01:08:27,982 --> 01:08:30,693
you were always
partial to the Chevelle, yes?

735
01:08:37,116 --> 01:08:39,660
-454?
-Yeah.

736
01:08:58,346 --> 01:08:59,764
-9-1-1.
-Hi.

737
01:08:59,847 --> 01:09:01,849
-What's your emergency?
-About that fella

738
01:09:01,933 --> 01:09:05,353
who killed all them people
at the Bull By The Balls last night.

739
01:09:05,853 --> 01:09:07,230
Sir?

740
01:09:07,271 --> 01:09:09,065
I know where you can find him.

741
01:09:11,067 --> 01:09:13,903
Stillwater Marsh Penitentiary
shut down ages ago.

742
01:09:14,654 --> 01:09:16,906
You wanna guess what Deacon's Tree was?

743
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:19,700
-Hanging tree.
-Yeah.

744
01:09:19,742 --> 01:09:23,913
Last hanging was in '38.
They left the tree to taunt the inmates.

745
01:09:24,372 --> 01:09:26,290
Google Maps says it's an eight-hour drive.

746
01:09:26,374 --> 01:09:27,917
-We should be...
-Webster,

747
01:09:29,335 --> 01:09:31,337
-I need you to stay here.
-What?

748
01:09:31,754 --> 01:09:34,298
No. You went alone last time.

749
01:09:34,423 --> 01:09:35,758
I'm not going alone.

750
01:09:36,259 --> 01:09:39,095
Are you gonna take that little girl over me?

751
01:09:40,096 --> 01:09:42,181
Give me the shells.

752
01:09:43,391 --> 01:09:46,936
You're a goddamned walking contradiction,
you know that?

753
01:09:47,103 --> 01:09:49,105
How many times you walk towards
the straight and narrow

754
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:51,899
only to get covered up
in someone else's blood?

755
01:09:52,942 --> 01:09:54,902
Whose blood are you gonna end up covered
in this time?

756
01:09:55,111 --> 01:09:58,281
-This time it's different.
-Is it?

757
01:10:18,259 --> 01:10:20,178
He's not coming?

758
01:10:20,595 --> 01:10:21,846
Piper,

759
01:10:22,472 --> 01:10:24,974
I need you. But I won't lie to you.

760
01:10:26,017 --> 01:10:27,810
This is going to be rough.

761
01:10:28,519 --> 01:10:30,021
Are you sure about this?

762
01:10:30,188 --> 01:10:33,107
My whole life has been nothing but waiting.

763
01:10:33,649 --> 01:10:37,612
Waiting on tables, waiting on fools,
waiting for it just to mean something.

764
01:10:38,404 --> 01:10:39,655
And now, it means something.

765
01:10:40,156 --> 01:10:41,782
I'm with you until the end.

766
01:11:09,143 --> 01:11:11,020
What do we do?

767
01:11:11,145 --> 01:11:12,730
Nothing yet.

768
01:11:13,022 --> 01:11:14,357
Shit.

769
01:11:27,328 --> 01:11:30,289
You just keep driving them to us.
We'll do the rest.

770
01:11:30,331 --> 01:11:33,417
And make sure you peel off
before the fireworks.

771
01:11:36,546 --> 01:11:38,798
Troopers, fall in!

772
01:11:42,426 --> 01:11:45,805
Gentlemen, these two have killed
two of our own.

773
01:11:45,888 --> 01:11:48,724
I know you want to make them pay.

774
01:11:48,766 --> 01:11:52,395
Therefore, when I tell you to
aim for their tires,

775
01:11:52,436 --> 01:11:54,230
what I mean is

776
01:11:54,355 --> 01:11:58,401
aim for their heads. Are we clear?

777
01:11:58,526 --> 01:11:59,944
Yes, sir!

778
01:12:01,195 --> 01:12:03,156
Very well then.

779
01:12:03,531 --> 01:12:05,241
Please,

780
01:12:06,325 --> 01:12:08,578
aim for their tires.

781
01:12:18,171 --> 01:12:20,840
There'll be even more ahead.

782
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:23,092
Just keep driving.

783
01:12:25,428 --> 01:12:27,263
I'm sorry.

784
01:12:40,902 --> 01:12:42,153
Here we go.

785
01:12:44,906 --> 01:12:46,282
End of the line, folks.

786
01:12:46,407 --> 01:12:48,701
Step out of the vehicle
with your hands raised.

787
01:12:49,785 --> 01:12:52,330
May as well give the boys a clear shot

788
01:12:52,413 --> 01:12:54,123
at their tires.

789
01:13:16,604 --> 01:13:17,939
What the hell is that?

790
01:13:20,149 --> 01:13:23,152
Well, this is unexpected.

791
01:13:24,445 --> 01:13:26,614
Everybody, clear the road!

792
01:13:27,114 --> 01:13:28,783
Get out of here!

793
01:13:51,806 --> 01:13:53,182
Get down.

794
01:14:25,298 --> 01:14:27,049
Give me that thing!

795
01:14:41,063 --> 01:14:42,607
You want us to shoot out his tires, Captain?

796
01:14:48,029 --> 01:14:50,531
No goddamn way.

797
01:14:50,865 --> 01:14:56,829
No ever loving way in God's good heaven
are you an FBI agent.

798
01:14:56,871 --> 01:14:58,372
I need you boys to stand down.

799
01:14:58,456 --> 01:15:00,249
Captain, you know what
this badge means, right?

800
01:15:00,875 --> 01:15:03,503
Federal Bureau of
get-the-fuck-out-of-my-way.

801
01:15:03,544 --> 01:15:07,215
You boys have blundered into
an ongoing Federal case.

802
01:15:07,298 --> 01:15:10,718
Now, lower your weapon.

803
01:15:15,348 --> 01:15:18,434
-You.
-Hey, hey, hey! Captain!

804
01:15:20,853 --> 01:15:23,940
It seems you're serving two masters.

805
01:15:24,398 --> 01:15:26,067
Take out your phone and call him.

806
01:15:26,484 --> 01:15:27,819
Call Jonah King.

807
01:15:28,903 --> 01:15:31,113
Tell him Milton is dead.

808
01:15:32,365 --> 01:15:35,827
Do as he says, Trooper.
You heard the agent.

809
01:15:36,077 --> 01:15:39,121
The rest of you, stand down.

810
01:15:41,415 --> 01:15:45,711
Everybody, stand down right now,
God damn it!

811
01:15:48,506 --> 01:15:50,424
Why aren't they following us?

812
01:15:50,508 --> 01:15:53,344
Because you're a straight up, certifiable,
cop-killing murderer,

813
01:15:53,427 --> 01:15:55,638
and they're scared of you.

814
01:16:00,852 --> 01:16:02,478
So, what now?

815
01:16:02,562 --> 01:16:04,397
Now we drive.

816
01:16:10,027 --> 01:16:14,282
Ride with the devil
Hide with the lord

817
01:16:14,824 --> 01:16:18,161
I got no pistol
Ain't got no sword

818
01:16:19,453 --> 01:16:23,249
I got no army
Ain't got no land

819
01:16:24,041 --> 01:16:27,753
Ain't got nothing
but the stone that's in my hand

820
01:16:28,296 --> 01:16:32,592
Stone in my hand
Stone in my hand

821
01:16:32,675 --> 01:16:36,512
All the love that's in my heart
And the stone that's in my hand

822
01:17:02,830 --> 01:17:04,582
Wait for me here.

823
01:18:03,641 --> 01:18:05,143
Piper?

824
01:18:05,351 --> 01:18:06,602
Milton.

825
01:18:15,611 --> 01:18:17,613
-Get away from her.
-I think not.

826
01:18:18,114 --> 01:18:21,117
I shoot you with this,
you know what it means.

827
01:18:21,450 --> 01:18:23,452
No heaven, no hell.

828
01:18:24,912 --> 01:18:26,372
You cease to exist.

829
01:18:26,414 --> 01:18:27,790
Damn it, Milton, shoot him.

830
01:18:27,915 --> 01:18:31,544
All the more reason
to keep Ms. Piper in close proximity.

831
01:18:31,586 --> 01:18:33,963
You are weary, Milton.
You might miss again.

832
01:18:34,046 --> 01:18:37,008
Who the hell do you think you are?

833
01:18:37,091 --> 01:18:38,843
Anubis?

834
01:18:38,926 --> 01:18:40,344
You can't stop me.

835
01:18:40,428 --> 01:18:42,972
Stop you?

836
01:18:43,055 --> 01:18:45,641
Milton, you wouldn't be here without me,
you ungrateful shit.

837
01:18:45,892 --> 01:18:48,644
That little roadblock back there,
that would have stopped you.

838
01:18:48,686 --> 01:18:51,230
So, I want you
to holster that iron God-killer,

839
01:18:51,314 --> 01:18:52,982
and say, "Thank you."

840
01:18:58,321 --> 01:19:04,994
I said, holster and "thank you."

841
01:19:11,709 --> 01:19:13,002
Don't hurt her.

842
01:19:14,629 --> 01:19:15,922
Thank you.

843
01:19:17,465 --> 01:19:18,716
Now, unbuckle the belt.

844
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,889
Right here, please.

845
01:19:28,226 --> 01:19:29,519
Ah, that's better.

846
01:19:29,977 --> 01:19:32,855
You're not the first to get out,
and I doubt you'll be the last,

847
01:19:32,939 --> 01:19:35,691
but I have got to know,

848
01:19:36,317 --> 01:19:40,404
how did you get out with the God-killer?

849
01:19:40,905 --> 01:19:42,907
I just walked in and took it.

850
01:19:43,658 --> 01:19:44,867
Oh.

851
01:19:45,326 --> 01:19:47,829
Wouldn't want to be you when he finds out.

852
01:19:47,954 --> 01:19:51,958
What's he gonna do? Not let me back in?

853
01:19:52,583 --> 01:19:55,878
-Why are you helping me?
-it's 'cause of those crazy fucks.

854
01:19:55,962 --> 01:19:58,130
They figured out how to bring hell to earth!

855
01:19:58,172 --> 01:20:00,842
Milton, it's real. Jonah's gonna do it.

856
01:20:13,688 --> 01:20:16,399
-That's cute. You haven't told her?
-Told her what?

857
01:20:16,482 --> 01:20:20,236
Young Ms. Piper,
let you in on a little secret.

858
01:20:21,404 --> 01:20:24,240
The Dark Lord, Satan, Beelzebub,

859
01:20:24,365 --> 01:20:26,033
Lucifer,

860
01:20:26,075 --> 01:20:29,537
simply the warden of a very large prison.
Quiet man, actually.

861
01:20:29,662 --> 01:20:30,913
Thoughtful and he's well-read.

862
01:20:38,171 --> 01:20:39,422
I happen to know,

863
01:20:39,505 --> 01:20:44,093
the idea of sacrificing children in his honor
annoys him greatly.

864
01:20:48,264 --> 01:20:51,017
-Why are you really helping me?
-We all have a job to do.

865
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:54,479
Getting you here makes my job easier.
You get what you want,

866
01:20:54,562 --> 01:20:56,814
-I get what I want.
-Then help me now.

867
01:20:56,898 --> 01:20:58,274
-No.
-There are 40 of them down there,

868
01:20:58,357 --> 01:20:59,942
-and you and I could...
-No.

869
01:21:09,785 --> 01:21:12,747
You want to save her, Milton?
Then you go, and you do it.

870
01:21:17,752 --> 01:21:19,754
If you win, I win.

871
01:21:19,837 --> 01:21:22,507
If they take you down, I win.

872
01:21:31,766 --> 01:21:33,518
And I hope you like butter on your popcorn.

873
01:21:33,601 --> 01:21:35,144
It's sure to be a grand show.

874
01:21:35,228 --> 01:21:39,232
You're still here? Milton, the clock's ticking.
Midnight approaches,

875
01:21:39,315 --> 01:21:41,275
-and the moon is full.
-Give me the keys.

876
01:21:42,944 --> 01:21:44,153
I'll be right here.

877
01:21:47,031 --> 01:21:48,574
My children,

878
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,743
we have come so far

879
01:21:50,952 --> 01:21:53,996
to this place where the dying earth

880
01:21:54,121 --> 01:21:56,457
bleeds its corrupt soul at our feet.

881
01:21:56,958 --> 01:22:00,002
From its death, we shall all be reborn.

882
01:22:00,086 --> 01:22:02,547
Reborn!

883
01:22:03,214 --> 01:22:04,590
We...

884
01:22:04,674 --> 01:22:06,759
We have been cast out and hunted.

885
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:09,762
But no more!

886
01:22:10,054 --> 01:22:11,472
No more.

887
01:22:19,313 --> 01:22:20,690
With this sacrifice,

888
01:22:21,023 --> 01:22:22,692
we shall no longer be shunned.

889
01:22:23,025 --> 01:22:24,819
They say the meek will inherit.

890
01:22:25,319 --> 01:22:28,739
They lie! We are not meek! We are chosen!

891
01:22:29,115 --> 01:22:32,994
And soon, the hounds of perdition
will howl at our command!

892
01:22:33,286 --> 01:22:36,914
For now, with a single thrust of this dagger,

893
01:22:36,998 --> 01:22:38,958
we shall all be set free!

894
01:22:46,549 --> 01:22:47,800
What the fuck?

895
01:23:24,795 --> 01:23:26,380
That's him!

896
01:23:27,924 --> 01:23:29,175
Come on, let's get him!

897
01:23:34,472 --> 01:23:37,600
Here, take it.
No matter what, that child dies tonight.

898
01:23:37,642 --> 01:23:39,685
I tell you to, and you cut his throat.

899
01:23:46,317 --> 01:23:47,610
That's him.

900
01:23:48,236 --> 01:23:49,529
They're both with Milton.

901
01:23:50,071 --> 01:23:52,573
Oh, yeah? You think you can stop all this?

902
01:23:59,997 --> 01:24:04,293
We're gonna kill your friend and the baby.
And We're gonna live forever.

903
01:24:04,919 --> 01:24:06,504
Forever?

904
01:24:06,921 --> 01:24:10,007
If forever to you is the next five seconds,
then you would be right.

905
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:25,273
Well...

906
01:24:37,493 --> 01:24:39,620
You be ready now.

907
01:24:40,788 --> 01:24:43,583
If kill you, you can't take him.

908
01:24:43,791 --> 01:24:46,961
Someone else will come.
Someone else always comes.

909
01:24:48,254 --> 01:24:51,799
Piper, he didn't steal that to stop me.

910
01:24:51,883 --> 01:24:54,594
He stole it to slow me down.
He's getting what he wanted.

911
01:24:54,969 --> 01:24:56,679
Go to him.

912
01:24:57,263 --> 01:24:59,265
Now, before it's too late.

913
01:25:11,819 --> 01:25:14,322
Hold on tight. It has quite the kick.

914
01:27:06,851 --> 01:27:08,436
Hey, dickless.

915
01:27:59,487 --> 01:28:02,073
Well, this has all gone to shit.

916
01:28:11,958 --> 01:28:15,461
Where are you going? Milton?

917
01:28:19,841 --> 01:28:21,884
The victory is still mine, friend.

918
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:28,182
Bring that baby over here now.

919
01:28:31,727 --> 01:28:34,063
I want him to witness this.

920
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:43,865
I said bring the fucking baby to me!

921
01:28:50,079 --> 01:28:52,999
I'm gonna beat you to death
with all that's left of your daughter.

922
01:28:54,375 --> 01:28:56,043
A daughter who hated you.

923
01:28:59,130 --> 01:29:03,426
The daughter who you let die!

924
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:15,730
All right, then.

925
01:29:23,696 --> 01:29:28,826
I just want you to know
that your daughter's death will pale

926
01:29:28,993 --> 01:29:32,371
to what is about to befall this child.

927
01:29:39,170 --> 01:29:40,797
I'm going to kill you.

928
01:29:43,007 --> 01:29:47,470
Ah, Milton, so many have tried.

929
01:29:50,264 --> 01:29:55,228
But I am armored with a power
that you will never know.

930
01:29:57,814 --> 01:29:59,774
Nothing of this earth can kill me.

931
01:30:11,994 --> 01:30:13,621
I'm not of this earth.

932
01:30:54,203 --> 01:30:55,997
Milton.

933
01:30:56,706 --> 01:30:58,249
Milton!

934
01:30:59,333 --> 01:31:01,627
-No, Milton.
-Where is she?

935
01:31:21,981 --> 01:31:23,232
I'm curious,

936
01:31:24,108 --> 01:31:25,443
would you have let him do it?

937
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:33,910
That's what I thought.

938
01:31:37,038 --> 01:31:38,664
See you soon.

939
01:31:44,045 --> 01:31:45,755
She's here.

940
01:32:00,561 --> 01:32:02,605
I am finished now.

941
01:32:07,819 --> 01:32:09,695
Keep her safe.

942
01:32:11,405 --> 01:32:13,199
Anyone tries to hurt her, I'll kill them.

943
01:32:13,282 --> 01:32:14,909
I know it.

944
01:32:15,868 --> 01:32:18,246
That's why I chose you.

945
01:32:25,545 --> 01:32:28,297
Webster will look out for you both,

946
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:31,425
as long as he can.

947
01:32:31,467 --> 01:32:32,802
No, Milton.

948
01:32:39,809 --> 01:32:42,311
Milton, please, don't go.

949
01:32:43,896 --> 01:32:45,690
Love her for me, Piper.

950
01:32:46,190 --> 01:32:49,068
Love her, and make her yours.

951
01:32:51,445 --> 01:32:56,868
I know I don't have a right to ask
for your promise.

952
01:32:57,285 --> 01:33:01,664
I promise. Milton, I promise.

953
01:33:02,456 --> 01:33:04,083
Thank you.

954
01:33:10,131 --> 01:33:11,382
No.

955
01:33:32,653 --> 01:33:34,030
Hey.

956
01:33:51,339 --> 01:33:52,590
Come on.

957
01:34:13,528 --> 01:34:14,779
Hi.

958
01:34:18,533 --> 01:34:20,910
-How was that?
-I've seen better.

959
01:34:22,411 --> 01:34:23,830
Guess she doesn't know you can

960
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:27,124
beat him, slow him, shoot him,
even stop him.

961
01:34:27,208 --> 01:34:29,710
But you can't kill a dead man.

962
01:34:33,297 --> 01:34:34,882
Shall we?

963
01:34:39,554 --> 01:34:43,850
Even in hell there is compassion.

964
01:34:58,072 --> 01:35:00,575
Just so you know, I don't plan on staying.

965
01:35:00,658 --> 01:35:03,161
Milton, you got what you wanted.

966
01:35:03,202 --> 01:35:07,957
I did, but if he puts me back in that hole,
I'll still get out.

967
01:35:08,166 --> 01:35:09,876
Remarkable.

968
01:35:11,002 --> 01:35:12,295
I actually look forward to that.

969
01:35:15,590 --> 01:35:18,092
You think you're Wotan?

970
01:35:22,263 --> 01:35:23,973
Give me the keys.

971
01:35:35,109 --> 01:35:39,530
I'm still alive
Must have been a miracle

972
01:35:41,699 --> 01:35:45,870
It's been a hell of ride
Destination still unknown

973
01:35:45,953 --> 01:35:47,371
It's a fact of life

974
01:35:47,455 --> 01:35:50,833
If you make one wrong move
with the gun to your head

975
01:35:50,958 --> 01:35:54,212
You better walk the line
or you'll be left for dead

976
01:35:55,963 --> 01:35:58,966
I'm a runaway train on broken track

977
01:35:59,008 --> 01:36:03,679
I'm a ticker on a bomb
that you can't turn back this time

978
01:36:03,930 --> 01:36:05,473
That's right

979
01:36:05,598 --> 01:36:08,935
I got away with it all and I'm still alive

980
01:36:08,976 --> 01:36:12,104
Let the end of the world come tumbling down

981
01:36:12,146 --> 01:36:16,651
I'll be the last man standing on the ground

982
01:36:17,026 --> 01:36:19,695
As long as I got blood rush trough my veins

983
01:36:19,779 --> 01:36:23,241
I'm still alive
