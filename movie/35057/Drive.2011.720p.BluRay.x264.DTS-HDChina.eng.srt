1
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,480
There are hundred thousand streets in the city.

2
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,320
You don't need to know around.

3
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,150
You give me a time and a place.

4
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,010
I give you a five-minute window,

5
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,170
anything happens in that five minutes I'm yours.

6
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,910
No matter what.

7
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,080
Anything happens in either side of that,

8
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,040
then you are on your own.

9
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,510
Do you understand?

10
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,350
Good.

11
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,650
And you won't be able to reach me on this phone again.

12
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,750
Hey, there you are!

13
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,050
She's down there.

14
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,660
Plain Jane boring, just like you asked for.

15
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,680
But, I dropped in 300 horses on the inside,

16
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,710
she's gonna fly.

17
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,810
You look like a zombie kid. You get any sleep?

18
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,690
Can I offer you some benzedrine,

19
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,020
dexedrine, caffeine, nicotine?

20
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,930
You don't smoke, that's right. Better off.

21
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:46,940
There she is!

22
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,530
Chevy Impala, most popular car in the state of California.

23
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,040
No one will be looking at you.

24
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,450
3 to 30 winger located at 421 south Almeida.

25
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,130
A pointed shot fired at code 30.

26
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,020
Come on.

27
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,860
What the fuck is it, come on!

28
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,900
Unit 5 wants you 20.

29
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,310
We're approximately two minutes to the location.

30
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,750
Come on, man, where the hell are you?

31
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,460
Come on.

32
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,840
Come on.

33
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,010
Come on, get in, get in.

34
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,230
All unit be advised, possible vehicle in question.

35
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,340

36
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,830
1 out of 3, something in 7, clear.

37
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,220
Roger you, 1 out of 3.

00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,940
The question area unit support.

39

00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,250

00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,140
Unit 3 base, negative.

44
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,030
We got a visual on request on 7 street bridge.

45
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,660
Copy that, unit 3.

46
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,890
Air based 3, we lost visual, lost suspect.

47
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,240

Standby.

55
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,040
Roger you, unit 6.

56
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,590
blocked by Griffin, he is not gotta go.

57
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,550
Griffin gets rebound, time winding down.

58
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:26,340
4, 3, 2, 1.

59
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:36,460
I'm giving you a night call to tell you how I feel

60
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:47,090
I want to drive you through the night, down the hills

61
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:57,390
I'm gonna tell you something you don't want to hear

62
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:08,450
I'm gonna show you where it's dark, but have no fear

63
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,710
There something inside you

64
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,210
It's hard to explain

65
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,400
They're talking about you boy

66
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,760
But you're still the same

67
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:38,250
There something inside you

68
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,190
It's hard to explain

69
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:49,440
They're talking about you boy

70
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,030
But you're still the same

71
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,970
There something inside you

72
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,880
It's hard to explain

73
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,500
They're talking about you boy

74
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,510
But you're still the same

75
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,900
- What floor? - 4th thanks.

76
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,190
Hey, kid.

77
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,410
Director wants to see a rollover. You okay with that?

78
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,290
Remember, if you don't feel good, just abort the shot.

79
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,870
There's no shame in that, alright?

80
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,470
You're doubling for the star.

81
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,210
It's not like you are a player or anything.

82
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,840
And I got you $500 more.

83
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,920
Of course we split that.

84
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,170
You okay? Ready to go? Alright.

85
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,840
I'm counting on you.

86
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,190
Excuse me, pal, this thing over here.

87
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,150
Just before you try camera

88
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,780
we need you to sign this contract.

89
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,650
Basically this is liability to complication

90
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,490
you die and may under serious injured.

91
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,080
And, action.

92
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,880
Alright,that's cut.

93
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,840
Kid! That's fantastic.

94
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,430
Just fantastic!

95
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,260
Okay, how're you doing? You are alright?

96
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,390
You good. Good, that was perfect.

97
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,300
- I love you. - I love you.

98
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,800
Where should I put these?

99
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,970
In the kitchen. Thank you.

100
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,140
Just a second.

101
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,190
Scary.

102
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,700
You want a tooth-pick?

103
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You want a glass of water?

104
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:37,920
Okay.

105
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,850
Thanks.

106
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,270
So, did you just moved to L.A.?

107
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,610
No, I've been here for a while.

108
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,740
You are just new here?

109
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,870
That's Benicio's father.

110
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,210
Where is he?

111
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,040
He's in prison.

112
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,550
What do you do?

113
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,510
I drive.

114
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,600
Like a limo driver?

115
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,180
No, like for movies.

116
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:37,310
You mean all those car chases and stuff?

117
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,610
Yeah.

118
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:40,610
Isn't that dangerous?

119
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,580
It's only part time.

120
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,000
- Mostly I work at the garage. - Where?

121
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,580
Receda Boulevard.

122
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,340
I gotta go.

123
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,010
Ok.

124
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,480
Thanks for the water.

125
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,280
- Say bye. - Bye.

126
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:03,020
Chicken Chowmein? And, some Peking duck.

127
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,320
Ok. Where are the chopsticks?

128
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,990
- You know the guy just... - Go get 'em. Go get 'em.

129
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,610
I don't want that. I don't want that.

130
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,450
You need it. Chopsticks and a fortune cookie.

131
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,580
Put out the fucking cigrette, I'm eating.

132
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,340
- Sorry. - What's the matter with you?

133
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,470
I'm just...

134
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,750
Never have a ashtray in this town.

135
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,460
You run a perfectly good business.

136
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,460
I don't know, why you wanna change now.

137
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,880
You know how much my business made last year?

138
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,890
30 grand.

139
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,470
I can build a car in six months and

140
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,270
in six seconds these jerks write it off as a stunt,

141
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,730
that won't even make it to the movie.

142
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,060
See, all I need is a hard used star car.

143
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:45,810
That's all.

144
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,110
I figure we start off small town circuit, we work our way up.

145
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,280
Once we get to the show, we are talking millions.

146
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:53,990
Chopstick, sir.

147
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,200
Yeah, where's the cookies?

148
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,340
Forget it, forget it.

149
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,580
So, you still haven't give me your number.

150
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,500
Alright, four hundred thirty thousand dollars.

151
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,260
Mr. Ross, I wouldn't come to you with this

152
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,880
unless I'm absolutely sure about it!

153
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,800
How can you be sure, Shannon.

154
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,260
What do you got that the big professional race team don't?

155
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,310
I got the driver.

156
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,810
You just told me there haven't got a dozen drivers.

157
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,150
Not like this one.

158
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,270
This kid is special.

159
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,030
Been working with him for a while,

160
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,650
I've never seen anybody like it.

161
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,860
If I had the money, I'd back him myself.

162
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,740
Yeah, but you don't have the money.

163
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,950
Mr. Ross, you put this kid behind the wheel,

164
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,880
there's nothing he cannot do.

165
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,710
There's money here, you can't lose.

166
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,170
Fuck you eating chink food in my fucking restaurant?

167
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,840
What's a Jew doing running a pizzeria?

168
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,880
You remember Shannon?

169
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,850
Take a fucking hike.

170
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,140
I wanna talk to my partner.

171
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,770
I'm just fucking with you.

172
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,780
How're you doing, Shannon?

173
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,730
How's the fucking leg?

174
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,020
I've paid my debt.

175
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,150
I'll think about it. Okay?

176
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,950
But I wanna meet the kid first.

177
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,950
That's all I ask.

178
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:33,340
C'mon, I want you to meet somebody.

179
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,840
Whatever you do like about the car, don't say anything.

180
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,560
I want to drive the price down a little bit.

181
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,010
Kid, I want you to meet Mr. Bernie Ross.

182
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,680
Nice to meet you.

183
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,730
My hands are a little dirty.

184
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,860
So are mine.

185
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,240
- Good driving out there. - Thanks.

186
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,120
Good kid. So? What do you think?

187
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,290
Do we get the 400?

188
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,500
I'll give you 300 for 70 percent.

189
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,880
Done!

190
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,470
You won't be sorry!

191
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,810
I'm Shannon, can I help you?

192
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,800
Hey pal, just drop it down here.

193
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,450
We're pushing it alright.

194
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,410
We wanna push her into number three.

195
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,620
- The car. Not you. - Good.

196
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,140
- Hi. - Hi.

197
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,210
- You two know each other? - Don't.

198
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,300
Look at that.

199
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,300
- We're neighbours. - Neighbours, very good.

200
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,430
Well, we'll try to be neighbourly too.

201
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,360
You blinked.

202
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,330
What?

203
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,240
- Can I call a cab from here. - Yeah, sure.

204
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,290
What am I talking about.

205
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:33,330
You and the kid are neighbours, right? He can take you.

206
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,250
No. I feel bad.

207
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,800
No, no. Don't even think twice about it.

208
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,220
He'll be happy to do it.

209
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,890
He's a good guy.

210
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:45,510
You know, he walked into my shop here about five or six years ago.

211
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,810
Right out of the blue, asking for a job.

212
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:51,810
So, I put him to the test, to see what he could do.

213
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,650
The kid is amazing.

214
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:57,530
So, I hired him on the spot.

215
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,170
At about half the wages I normally pay.

216
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,070
He didn't even blink an eye.

217
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:05,160
Hey kid, come over here for a sec, would you.

218
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,990
And I have been exploiting him ever since.

219
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,710
Don't tell him.

220
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:16,170
Looks like we've bigger problem than I thought.

221
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:19,300
We're gonna have to keep the car here for a few days.

222
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,300
So, I offered your services

223
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,380
to take Benicio and Irene home.

224
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,390
Would that be okay?

225
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,810
Yeah, sure.

226
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:35,190
- I don't have wheels on my car. - Ok.

227
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,400
It's one think you should know about me.

228
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:38,980
Well put the tyres on.

229
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,900
- You got about five minutes? - Yeah.

230
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,840
Hey, do you wanna see something?

231
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,810
Yeah.

232
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,810
Okay.

233
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:23,750
Back against the wall and ours

234
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,570
With the strength of a willing to cause

235
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:30,820
A pursuit some called outstanding

236
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:35,440
Or emotionally complex

237
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,010
Against a grain

238
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:40,270
Left to stop at claims

239
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:44,960
Of all the thoughts your actions entertaining

240
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:49,810
And you, have proved, to be

241
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:59,150
A real human being, and a real hero

242
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:08,120
A real human being, and a real hero

243
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,360
A real human being

244
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:27,680
155 people or more

245
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,010
All safe and all rescued

246
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:35,040
From the slowly sinking ship

247
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,890
What are warmer than

248
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,080
His head so cool

249
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,730
And type I knew what to do

250
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:49,960
And you, have proved, to be

251
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:55,340
A real human being

252
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:03,230
A real human being

253
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:15,600
That was good. We had a good time.

254
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,860
Me too.

255
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:35,330
Sorry, if I put you on the spot showing up like that.

256
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,910
It's okay.

257
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,560
I'm not doing anything this weekend.

258
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,320
If you wanna a ride or something.

259
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,280
Don't worry about her bumps and bruises.

260
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,670
Thats fiber glasses, that's easily replaceable.

261
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:51,210
We coat a paint on there with sponsors detail.

262
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,900
Look at the thread on the tyre,

263
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,760
still good huh, we are in business.

264
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:59,110
You paid 300 fucking grand for this piece of shit?

265
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,430
I paid for it, out of my own pocket.

266
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,430
This is just the shell.

267
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,270
It's the inside that counts. Not the outside.

268
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,350
Right, Shannon?

269
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,440
You are correct sir.

270
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,310
Fuck that shit. If I paid 300 for something,

271
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,440
I want everybody to see it.

272
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,440
Of course you do.

273
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,650
Now this.

274
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:18,680
That is one motherfucking fine ass pussy mobile,

275
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,450
motherfucker!

276
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,580
Damn!

277
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,620
Shannon, sell him that car.

278
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,370
He won't be able to find a pussy in a whorehouse.

279
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:31,000
You know what? This car will make you even good looking.

280
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,460
I'm already good looking, pal.

281
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,130
How's it going?

282
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,220
When's our first race?

283
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,890
Uhh, pretty soon.

284
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,640
You gonna be ready?

285
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,350
I hope so.

286
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,650
Huh... I hope so.

287
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:54,020
Hey, no false modesty. I got a lot of money on this.

288
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,110
Did Shannon ever tell you how we met?

289
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,160
I used to produce movies.

290
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,160
In the 80's.

291
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,120
Kinda like action films and sexy stuff.

292
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,960
One critic called them 'European'.

293
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,080
I thought they were shit.

294
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:15,500
Anyway he arranged all the cars for me. Did all the stunts.

295
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:18,090
I liked him. I like having him around.

296
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,470
Even though, he'd overcharge the shit out of me.

297
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,260
His next business venture.

298
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,680
He got involved with some of Nino's friends.

299
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,810
They didn't go for the overcharging bit.

300
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,020
They broke his pelvis.

301
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,400
He's never had a lot of luck.

302
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,680
The reason I'm telling you this is,

303
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,450
He's got a lot invested in you.

304
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,910
So do I.

305
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:44,160
So, you need anything, you call me.

306
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,200
We're a team now.

307
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,670
Huh, I'm excited.

308
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,710
Nino. Get the fuck out of here.

309
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,100
- You see the bad guy? - Yeah.

310
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,040
How can you tell?

311
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,860
'cause he's a shark.

312
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,360
There's no good sharks?

313
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:23,910
No... I mean, just look at him.

314
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,620
Does he look like a good guy to you?

315
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,490
This is Cindy.

316
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,710
That was my hausband's lawyer.

317
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,880
He's coming home in a week.

318
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:51,170
You know, we're here celebrating. But it's...

319
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:56,060
It's a shameful thing... what I did.

320
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:01,020
And I have a lot of making up to you, to everyone.

321
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,900
But second chances are rare.

322
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,990
Right?

323
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,330
And that's worth celebrating. Right?

324
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:21,000
So, I want to make a toast to that lady right there.

325
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:25,670
Thanks for staying. I love you, Irene.

326
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,300
Salud.

327
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:42,920
Hey.

328
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,710
Hi.

329
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:56,350
Sorry about the noise.

330
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,980
I was gonna call the cops.

331
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:06,650
I wish you would.

332
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,110
Oye, getting heavier.

333
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:21,950
- Hey, how are you doing? - Hi.

334
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,790
This guy has been telling a lot about you.

335
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:28,210
He says, you've been coming around and helping out a lot.

336
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:31,960
Yeah? Helping out. Is that right?

337
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,800
Is that right?

338
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,890
That's very nice. That's nice of you. Thank you.

339
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:42,980
You're welcome.

340
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:49,820
- You drive for the movies? - Yeah.

341
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,900
- I can take that. - No, no. I got it.

342
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,810
Let mommy talk to her friend. Go.

343
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,220
You have a good night.

344
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,390
You're Shannon's buddy, Right?

345
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,100
We met last year.

346
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,940
You drove me and my brother back from Palm Springs.

347
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:16,240
We hired another wing man.

348
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:19,740
I spend six months in jail and my brother got himself killed.

349
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:25,870
I've got a sweet job coming up.

350
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:26,870
How about this?

351
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:29,120
You shut you mouth.

352
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:32,330
Or I'll kick your teeth down your throat and I'll shut it for you.

353
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:42,470
Nice seeing you again.

354
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:00,810
Come on, it's okay.

355
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,050
Come here.

356
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,590
Don't be scared.

357
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:10,680
Look, don't tell mommy. Okay?

358
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:16,020
Okay, it's a secret between us boys.

359
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:19,820
Oh, fuck me.

360
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,800
Who are they?

361
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,260
What the fuck are you gonna do?

362
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,710
You gonna go and beat them out for me?

363
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,510
Huh, stunt guy.

364
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:31,350
Why the fuck do you wanna know who they are?

365
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,030
There's some guy who want me to do a job for him.

366
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:47,200
But I'm not gonna do it.

367
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:50,280
That's who they are.

368
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,040
What's the job?

369
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,410
He wanted me to rob a pawn shop in the valley.

370
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,380
Why?

371
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:02,360
'cause I owe them protection money,

372
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,670
for when I was in the inside.

373
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:04,760
It's two thousand bucks.

374
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,760
And as soon as I got out,

375
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,380
oh, it's five thousand bucks.

376
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,470
Oh, no, it's actually, ten thousand dollars.

377
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:12,500
Twenty thousand dollars.

378
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,270
Tomorrow I don't know what it's gonna be.

379
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,640
What are you gonna do?

380
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,650
That's a very good question.

381
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:27,400
They said they're gonna come after Benicio and Irene next.

382
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:51,930
You okay?

383
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,060
You want something to drink?

384
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,020
What's that you got there?

385
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,190
Can I see?

386
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:20,330
- One of those men gave you this? - Mmmhm.

387
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:24,500
They told me not to lose it.

388
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:31,220
You want me to keep this for you?

389
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,430
Okay.

390
00:45:58,370 --> 00:45:59,830
- How's Benice? - Good.

391
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:06,750
You just saying that?

392
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:12,130
No. what do you mean?

393
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,560
I saw that Standard...

394
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,600
was in an accident.

395
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,890
Yeah.

396
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,610
What happened?

397
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,860
He got beat up.

398
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,330
Why?

399
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:41,540
Just drunk kids.

400
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,970
You should come over.

401
00:46:58,350 --> 00:46:59,470
You should come and see him.

402
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:08,360
You wanna...

403
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,400
You wanna hear a story?

404
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:12,170
- You wanna hear how mommy and me met? - Yeah.

405
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:14,560
Yeah? Ok.

406
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:17,910
We're at a party.

407
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:20,030
And she was nineteen years old.

408
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:21,080
Seventeen.

409
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:23,120
- You're not seventeen. - I was.

410
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,540
- Wow, so that's illegal. - Yeah.

411
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:30,840
Alright, so I illegally walked over to

412
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,840
a seventeen year old girl.

413
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:34,590
I walked up and I say....

414
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:36,260
"Hello, Miss."

415
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:38,470
What is your name?

416
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:41,310
And she didn't say anything.

417
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:44,810
And I said, well... my name's Standard Gabriel.

418
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:47,100
Then what did you said.

419
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:53,820
I said...

420
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:57,150
Where's the deluxe version?

421
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,120
She is good, isn't it?

422
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:06,410
She is sharp.

423
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,640
Oh man, that killed me.

424
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,550
And then a year later, you popped out, man.

425
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:23,680
Best days in my life.

426
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:10,600
If I drive for you, you'll get your money.

427
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,190
You tell me where we start, where we're going...

428
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:14,730
Where we're going afterwards.

429
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:16,730
I give you a five-minutes when we get there.

430
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,140
Anything happens in that five minutes

431
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,460
and I'm yours no matter what.

432
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,670
Anything a minute either side of that,

433
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,650
then you are on your own.

434
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:26,490
I don't sit in while you're running it down.

435
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:27,490
I don't carry a gun.

436
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,610
I drive.

437
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:32,850
You look like you are hard to work with.

438
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:35,380
Not if we understand each other.

439
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:38,170
What's to understand?

440
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:40,120
I cannot do this thing alone.

441
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:41,410
You got Blanche.

442
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,090
C'mon man.

443
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,600
She's beautiful, look at her.

444
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:51,140
Fuck you rolling your eyes at for?

445
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:54,980
You know, get the fuck out of here.

446
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,110
Get up!

447
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:58,610
Standard, take her with you, and go get her a fucking coke.

448
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:06,990
Okay, here's the deal.

449
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:10,660
This much for Blanche,

450
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:15,750
This much for that asshole... minus what he owes me.

451
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:19,700
And this much for you.

452
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,010
You're still interested?

453
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,470
Good!

454
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:30,350
Anything else?

455
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,060
When you get your money,

456
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,500
his debt's paid.

457
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:36,700
He's out for good.

458
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:39,450
You never go near his family ever again.

459
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,070
Do you understand?

460
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:47,910
To my family.

461
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:49,450
To my new friend.

462
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:54,960
And toast to the future.

463
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:58,880
Our future.

464
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:25,300
I'll see you in five minutes.

465
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,120
See you in four.

466
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:14,400
How much did Cook said we're gonna get?

467
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,370
Fourty grand.

468
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,460
Stay here.

469
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,550
When was the last time you saw your husband?

470
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:57,150
Can you answer the question?

471
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,170
Ma'am?

472
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:07,900
Hello?

473
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,040
Benicio, Is that you?

474
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,140
Yeah.

475
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:15,630
Your mother there?

476
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:20,380
Uh, she's sitting down... talking to the police.

477
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,610
Okay, just tell her I'm gonna call her back. Okay?

478
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,100
Okay, bye.

479

00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:20,420
Now, what did Cook tell you?

503
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:24,180
He said there'd be another car hold us up.

504
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:26,800
But he didn't say anything about all these money.

505
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,010
He didn't say anything about anyone getting killed.

506
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,980
And he was gonna rip us off?

507
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:41,730
What's his real name?

508
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:44,200
He said it's Chris... but I just call him Cook.

509
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:52,620
You're gonna take me to him. Right now.

510
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:56,420
Do you understand?

511
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,830
Yeah.

512
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,740
What's you do to the cash?

513
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:16,530
'Cause I can keep it safe for you.

514
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:17,620
Would you just stop?

515
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:27,710
This guy Cook, he have a real name?

516
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:30,250
Chris.

517
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,760
Maybe.

518
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:38,010
I'll ask Bernie, see if he knows him.

519
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:42,430
Jesus! I can't stop thinking about...

520
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:44,760
what we could do with all that dough.

521
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,020
- Would you stop? - Alright!

522
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:48,690
You know, a lot of guys messing around with married women.

523
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:50,180
but you're the only one

524
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:52,900
I know who robs a joint, to pay back the husband.

525
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,030
Crazy!

526
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:57,030
Don't worry about it.

527
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:58,820
I'll take care of it.

528
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:30,900
Where's Cook?

529
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:32,610
He's in the dressing room.

530
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:35,440
Where's that?

531
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:38,110
It's over there.

532
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,270
Whose money do I have?

533
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,190
Don't worry... they're gonna come and get it.

534
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:16,490
Call them.

535
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:18,450
Somebody call Nino.

536
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:32,170
Do you remember this?

537
01:05:58,030 --> 01:05:59,450
- Hello. - Nino?

538
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:02,450
No, sorry pal. Why don't you call back later, we're closed.

539
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:03,890
I could,

540
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:06,410
but I think Nino would be upset that you made him wait.

541
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:08,910
Can I ask what this is about?

542
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:11,620
I have something of his.

543
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:13,830
And that would be?

544
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:16,730
A million dollars.

545
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:19,130
Please hold.

546
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:29,100
You have something that fucking belongs to me.

547
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:36,570
Seems that way.

548
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:40,900
And you're calling me...

549
01:06:41,490 --> 01:06:43,570
why?

550
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:47,200
You're expecting to buy my own shit back from you?

551
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,700
I'm not selling it.

552
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:50,640
I'm gonna give you a time and place,

553
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,370
and you're gonna come and get it.

554
01:06:52,370 --> 01:06:54,710
Do you understand?

555
01:06:56,460 --> 01:06:58,000
What are you getting out of it?

556
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:00,550
Just that.

557
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:03,340
'Out of it.'

558
01:07:04,430 --> 01:07:06,010
And your partners are happy with that?

559
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:09,810
I don't have any partners.

560
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:15,020
You discuss this with anybody else?

561
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,440
No, just with you.

562
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:21,650
You're not very good at this. Are you?

563
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:35,920
Go check it out who the fucking guy is?

564
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:16,420
Can I talk to you for a minute?

565
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:19,670
I can't talk, I have to go.

566
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,840
Can I just walk with you for?

567
01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:47,820
I have to tell you something.

568
01:08:54,450 --> 01:08:56,960
Standard was into some...

569
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:01,380
guys in prison for a lot of money.

570
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:06,550
And it would ruin you and Benicio if he wouldn't pay it.

571
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:12,050
He asked me for my help.

572
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:18,060
Everything went wrong, eh.

573
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,570
I'm sorry.

574
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:29,410
I still got the money.

575
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:35,870
You can have it, if you want to.

576
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,960
You can take Benicio...

577
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:53,890
I just thought, we could get out of here.

578
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:55,180
If you wanted.

579
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,690
I could come with you.

580
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:06,360
I could look out for you.

581
01:10:11,490 --> 01:10:14,280
Sorry...uh... Wrong floor.

582
01:13:38,030 --> 01:13:40,070
He came into my apartment, Shannon.

583
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:43,060
How did they know where I live?

584
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:47,120
I told you, I was gonna call Bernie.

585
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,170
I just wanted him know that...

586
01:13:49,210 --> 01:13:49,830
that it wasn't about that,

587
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:51,380
you are not interested in the money.

588
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:53,500
and that you just did it for the girl.

589
01:13:55,470 --> 01:13:56,650
What did you say?

590
01:13:56,650 --> 01:13:57,170
No, no.

591
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:01,420
What the fucking are you told them about Irene?

592
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:02,200
Calm down.

593
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:03,850
You told him about Irene!!!

594
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:04,930
Calm down. Calm down.

595
01:14:04,930 --> 01:14:05,970
Just calm down a little.

596
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:07,640
I'll kill you.

597
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:09,240
You told them about Irene?

598
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:11,530
Listen, I just, I just wanted him to know...

599
01:14:12,650 --> 01:14:14,270
that as soon as you return the money,

600
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:15,500
that was the end of it. That's all.

601
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,900
I didn't know, how was I supposed to know?

602
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:19,400
How was I supposed to know that?!

603
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,400
Okay?

604
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:23,100
Look, let me just talk to Bernie... okay?

605
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:26,660
Why you got to fuck everything up, Shannon?

606
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:27,930
How was I supposed to know?

607
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:29,570
Everything is related to Nino!

608
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:37,670
They're gonna come looking for me.

609
01:14:37,710 --> 01:14:39,470
and they're gonna come for you.

610
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,800
Do you understand?

611
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,010
You gotta get out of here.

612
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:44,720
and you gotta get out now.

613
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,890
Listen to me. Listen to me, Shannon. Listen.

614
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:53,270
You get out of here and you never fucking come back.

615
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,690
You never come back.

616
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:04,320
What are you gonna do?

617
01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:23,550
I already gave you my advice.

618
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:26,890
You should've taken the money, and left the guy alone.

619
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:28,140
It's just not that simple Bernie.

620
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:29,190
No! Of course not!

621
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:31,060
Now everything's bounced up in your face!

622
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:32,420
You know, I owe you this guy.

623
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:34,520
Just give me a little time and I'll get rid of him.

624
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,730
Shut the fuck up.

625
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:38,730
You fucking monkey!

626
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:42,410
The money, belongs to some half-assed wise guy,

627
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:42,990
out of Philly.

628
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:44,660
Now I got tipped off...

629
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:47,290
he was stashing a million bucks in a pawn shop.

630
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:49,030
He's gonna invest it here in L.A.

631
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,000
He was gonna set up a rival operation.

632
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:53,710
So, you stole from the east-coast mob?

633
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:56,670
Now! I stole from some jump up punk,

634
01:15:56,830 --> 01:15:58,840
who's trying to step on our action.

635
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:01,170
Yeah... then why didn't you come to me,

636
01:16:01,170 --> 01:16:03,340
before you set up this dummy robbery?

637
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,760
Before you hire this piece of shit.

638
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,070
This was something off to the side,

639
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:09,640
Bernie. I didn't wanna involve you on this.

640
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:11,600
Well, I'm involved now!

641
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:15,520
Let me tell you something.

642
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:21,610
Anybody! Anybody finds out you stole from the family,

643
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:22,740
we are both dead.

644
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:24,350
What fucking family?

645
01:16:25,950 --> 01:16:29,030
The family who still calls me a fucking kike?

646
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:31,580
To my face!

647
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:34,910
You know, I'm fifty nine years old Bernie,

648
01:16:34,910 --> 01:16:37,920
they still pinched my cheek like I'm some fucking kid.

649
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:40,250
Family.

650
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:43,010
The money always flows up, easy.

651
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:45,630
You know that.

652
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:48,840
That's why this driver's gotta go, Bernie.

653
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,470
He's gotta go.

654
01:16:51,470 --> 01:16:53,560
and your pal, Shannon.

655
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:57,060
It's these two guys, that can tie me to this rob.

656
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:39,520
Now, it's your turn to clean up after me.

657
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:44,880
All this priceless cars

658
01:18:45,210 --> 01:18:47,670
one would think you'd have better locks.

659
01:18:49,630 --> 01:18:53,390
Alright... doors is always open to you.

660
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:55,550
Going somewhere?

661
01:19:00,210 --> 01:19:02,140
I was thinking about it.

662
01:19:03,230 --> 01:19:05,860
I'm looking for your driver.

663
01:19:07,650 --> 01:19:10,070
You are breaking in here, I figure it's bad news.

664
01:19:10,150 --> 01:19:11,320
No, Shannon.

665
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:13,250
It's bad luck.

666
01:19:14,410 --> 01:19:18,040
Two thousand heists a year in this city.

667
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:19,910
He has to pick the wrong one.

668
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:22,160
He tried to put it right.

669
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:24,080
Well, he picked the wrong guy for that too.

670
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:26,760
My partner is a belligerent asshole,

671
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:28,630
with his back against the wall.

672
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:31,510
Right now, so am I.

673
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:34,890
If I don't set this straight, I'm in big trouble.

674
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:40,850
Any idea where he might be?

675
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,980
Mexico.

676
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:48,360
or maybe it was Balize.

677
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,990
Really?

678
01:19:59,450 --> 01:20:02,790
I was excited about this whole thing.

679
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:05,170
My name on a car!

680
01:20:05,370 --> 01:20:07,670
I mean, look how beautiful.

681
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:10,840
I wanted to see my name on this thing.

682
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:15,680
I think we would've made a go with this business.

683
01:20:31,230 --> 01:20:32,070
Don't worry.

684
01:20:32,110 --> 01:20:33,150
Don't worry.

685
01:20:33,190 --> 01:20:34,200
That's it.

686
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:38,280
It's done. There is no pain, it's over. It's over.

687
01:25:16,050 --> 01:25:17,710
What the fuck was that?

688
01:27:55,730 --> 01:27:57,000
Hello.

689
01:27:58,260 --> 01:28:01,760
You know the story about this scorpion and a frog

690
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:07,770
You friend Nino didn't make it, cross the river.

691
01:28:09,730 --> 01:28:12,860
I think this thing has gone on long enough.

692
01:28:14,070 --> 01:28:16,490
You see any reason for this to continue?

693
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:20,290
What do you say we meet?

694
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:23,910
Why?

695
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:27,330
Well...

696
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:31,090
You, me and your girlfriend are the only players left.

697
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:34,180
How's that for a reason?

698
01:28:35,930 --> 01:28:37,010
When?

699
01:28:37,090 --> 01:28:38,350
Tomorrow.

700
01:28:39,470 --> 01:28:41,180
There's a place on Sherman Way

701
01:28:41,310 --> 01:28:43,180
there's a restaurant called The Great Wall.

702
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,140
Do you know it?

703
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:14,880
Can I talk to you?

704
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,510
I won't keep you long.

705
01:29:24,350 --> 01:29:26,100
I have to go somewhere now.

706
01:29:26,270 --> 01:29:28,310
I don't think I can come back.

707
01:29:32,690 --> 01:29:34,650
And I just want you to know...

708
01:29:35,150 --> 01:29:37,950
getting to be around you and Benicio...

709
01:29:39,910 --> 01:29:42,370
was the best thing that ever happened to me.

710
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:35,960
Do you bring the money?

711
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:44,140
Here's what I'm prepared to offer...

712
01:30:45,430 --> 01:30:47,270
you give me the money, the girl is safe.

713
01:30:48,350 --> 01:30:51,560
Forever, nobody knows about it. She's off the map.

714
01:30:53,810 --> 01:30:55,860
I can't offer you the same.

715
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:00,000
So, this is what I would suggest.

716
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:03,370
We conclude our deals. We shake hands.

717
01:31:03,570 --> 01:31:06,630
You start the rest of you life.

718
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:13,580
Any dreams you have or plans,or hopes for the future.

719
01:31:13,630 --> 01:31:15,340
I think you got to put that on hold.

720
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,090
For the rest of your life,

721
01:31:18,090 --> 01:31:19,880
you're gonna be looking over your shoulder.

722
01:31:20,090 --> 01:31:21,560
I'm just telling you this,

723
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:24,140
because I want you to know the truth.

724
01:31:25,390 --> 01:31:27,240
But the girl is safe.

725
01:31:47,660 --> 01:31:49,040
Where is the money now?

726
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,000
It's in the car.

727
01:34:22,770 --> 01:34:27,610
A real human being...

728
01:34:47,130 --> 01:34:51,090
155 people or more

729
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:54,510
All safe and all rescued

730
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:58,520
From the slowly sinking ship

731
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:01,150
What are warmer than

732
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:03,190
His head so cool

733
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:07,030
And type I knew what to do

734
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:13,660
And you, have proved, to be

735
01:35:14,410 --> 01:35:22,370
A real human being, and a real hero

736
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:30,700
A real human being, and a real hero

737
01:35:31,550 --> 01:35:39,980
A real human being, and a real hero...
