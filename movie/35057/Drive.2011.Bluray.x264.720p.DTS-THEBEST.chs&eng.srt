香农，你是怎么这么确定？
How can you be sure, Shannon.

141
00:21:45,84 --> 00:21:49,22
你有哪些专业比赛队伍没有的东西呢？
What do you got that the big professional race team don't?

142
00:21:50,81 --> 00:21:52,31
我有一个车手
I got the driver.

143
00:21:52,56 --> 00:21:54,81
你的意思别人都没车手
You just told me there haven't got a dozen drivers.

144
00:21:54,85 --> 00:21:57,10
这个与众不同
Not like this one.

145
00:21:57,35 --> 00:21:59,23
这小子很特别
This kid is special.

146
00:21:59,31 --> 00:22:02,61
和他相处了一段时间 我从没有见过一个人能够像他这样
Been working with him for a while, I've never seen anybody like it.

147
00:22:02,61 --> 00:22:04,86
如果我有钱，我自己也会支持他的
If I had the money, I'd back him myself.

148
00:22:04,86 --> 00:22:06,74
但是你没有钱
Yeah, but you don't have the money.

149
00:22:08,24 --> 00:22:11,95
罗斯先生，给他一辆车
Mr.Ross, You put this kid behind the wheel...

150
00:22:12,08 --> 00:22:13,58
没有什么事他无法实现
there's nothing he cannot do.

151
00:22:14,20 --> 00:22:16,71
他就是个摇钱树，绝对不容错过
There's money here, you can't lose.

152
00:22:17,50 --> 00:22:20,13
你在我他妈的餐馆吃什么呢？
fuck you eating chink food in my fucking restaurant?

153
00:22:20,21 --> 00:22:22,84
那犹太人开他妈什么意大利餐馆啊？
What's a Jew doing running a pizzaria?

154
00:22:23,51 --> 00:22:24,88
还记得香农不？
You remember Shannon?

155
00:22:28,47 --> 00:22:29,85
滚一边凉快去
Take a fucking hike.

156
00:22:29,89 --> 00:22:31,14
我和我的伙伴有些事
I wanna talk to my partner.

157
00:22:33,89 --> 00:22:36,77
哈哈，开个玩笑
Hah, I'm just fucking with you.

158
00:22:37,10 --> 00:22:39,73
你他妈过的如何啊香农？ 还有他妈的那条腿，怎么样了？
How're you doing Shannon. How's the fucking leg?

159
00:22:40,48 --> 00:22:42,02
我已经还清债了
I've paid my debt.

160
00:22:42,90 --> 00:22:47,15
我会考虑考虑刚才的事情的，今天先到这吧？
I'll think about it. Okay?

161
00:22:47,15 --> 00:22:48,91
但是我想先看一下那小子
But I wanna meet the kid first.

162
00:22:48,99 --> 00:22:50,91
求之不得
That's all I ask.

163
00:23:02,63 --> 00:23:05,30
来，我想带你见个人
C'mon, I want you to meet somebody.

164
00:23:05,30 --> 00:23:07,93
不管你有多喜欢车，什么都不要说
Whatever you do like about the car, don't say anything.

165
00:23:08,13 --> 00:23:10,18
我想把价格调低点
I want to drive the price down a little bit.

166
00:23:10,18 --> 00:23:13,01
孩子，来见过伯尼.罗斯先生
Kid, I want you to meet Mr.Bernie Ross.

167
00:23:14,56 --> 00:23:15,68
很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you.

168
00:23:20,31 --> 00:23:21,69
我的手有点脏
My hands are a little dirty.

169
00:23:23,32 --> 00:23:24,82
我也一样
So are mine.

170
00:23:29,20 --> 00:23:32,20
- 刚才开得不错 - 谢谢
- Good driving out there. - Thanks.

171
00:23:36,91 --> 00:23:38,08
好了，考虑的如何？
So? what do you think?

172
00:23:38,16 --> 00:23:39,29
我们能拿40万么？
Do we get the 400K?

173
00:23:41,08 --> 00:23:43,46
我会用30万购买百分之七十的部分
I'll give you 300K for 70 percent.

174
00:23:46,34 --> 00:23:47,84
成交！
Done!

175
00:23:52,93 --> 00:23:54,47
你不会后悔的！
you won't be sorry!

176
00:24:00,73 --> 00:24:02,81
我是香农，有什么能帮您的么？
I'm shannon,can I help you?

177
00:24:05,94 --> 00:24:07,99
- 你的腿？ - 没事，只是一点小事，来我看看你的车


178
00:24:12,24 --> 00:24:14,45
嘿伙计，就把他放在那儿 我们现在就要把他推进来了
Hey pal, just drop it down here. We're pushing it alright.

179
00:24:14,49 --> 00:24:17,37
把他推进三号车位
We wanna push her into number three.

180
00:24:17,37 --> 00:24:19,62
- 说的是汽车，不是你 - 哦，知道了
- The car. Not you. - Oh good.

181
00:24:19,62 --> 00:24:22,12

- Hi... - hi. - Hi... - hi.

182
00:24:24,21 --> 00:24:26,21
- 嗯…你们以前认识？ - 不
- uhh...You two know each other? - Don't.

183
00:24:26,25 --> 00:24:28,26
怎么这么羞涩？
Oh look at that.

184
00:24:28,26 --> 00:24:29,26
- 我们是邻居 - 哇，邻居，太好了
- We're neighbours. - Neihhbours, very good.

185
00:24:29,26 --> 00:24:32,38
好吧，我们也会努力好好相处的
Well, we'll try to be neighbourly too.

186
00:24:53,16 --> 00:24:54,36
你眨眼了
You blinked.

187
00:24:55,16 --> 00:24:56,28
什么？
What?

188
00:24:57,37 --> 00:24:59,24
- 我能从这里叫辆车么？ - 当然
- Can I call a cab from here. - Yeah, sure.

189
00:25:01,00 --> 00:25:02,29
你瞧这说到哪里去了
What am I talking 'bout.

190
00:25:02,29 --> 00:25:05,29
你和他是邻居对吧 他能够把你送回去
You and the kid are neighbours, right. He can take you.

191
00:25:05,42 --> 00:25:07,25
哦别，我感觉这样不好
Oh no. I feel bad.

192
00:25:07,38 --> 00:25:11,17
不，不…不要再想了 他会很高兴的
No, no...Don't even think twice about it. He'll be happy to do it.

193
00:25:11,17 --> 00:25:12,17
他是一个好人
He's a good guy.

194
00:25:13,93 --> 00:25:17,51
和你说，他来我这里已经5、6年了…
You know, he walked into my shop here about five or six years ago...

195
00:25:17,51 --> 00:25:20,81
突然就来了 想找一个工作
right out of the blue, asking for a job.

196
00:25:20,81 --> 00:25:23,81
所以，我招他进来试用一下，看看是否满足要求
So, i put him to the test, to see what he could do.

197
00:25:24,94 --> 00:25:26,65
他做的非常好
The kid is amazing.

198
00:25:26,65 --> 00:25:29,53
所以我马上就聘用了他 对了！
So, i hired him on the spot. Boom!

199
00:25:29,53 --> 00:25:34,07
我只付给他普通薪水的一半，他连眼都不眨一下
At about half the wages i normally pay. He didn't even blink an eye.

200
00:25:34,07 --> 00:25:37,16
嘿，小子 过来一下
Hey kid, come over here for a sec,would you.

201
00:25:38,20 --> 00:25:40,95
从那时候起，我就开始盘剥他了
And I have been exploiting him ever since.

202
00:25:43,04 --> 00:25:44,71
别和他讲
Don't tell him.

203
00:25:44,71 --> 00:25:48,17
看，问题大概超出了我们的想象
Looks like we've bigger problem than I thought.

204
00:25:48,17 --> 00:25:51,30
我们不得不把这辆车留下来几天
We're gonna have to keep the car here for a few days.

205
00:25:51,30 --> 00:25:55,34
所以，你去把本尼西奥和艾琳送回家吧
So, I offered your services to take, Benicio and Irene home.

206
00:25:55,34 --> 00:25:56,34
行么？
Would that be okay?

207
00:25:59,60 --> 00:26:01,81
当然
Yeah sure.

208
00:26:04,23 --> 00:26:07,19
我车的轮子还没有装上
I don't have wheels... on my car.

209
00:26:08,73 --> 00:26:10,36
我想应该让你知道一下
It's one think you should know about me.

210
00:26:10,36 --> 00:26:10,98
把轮胎也上好吧
Well put the tyres on.

211
00:26:11,11 --> 00:26:13,86
- 等我5分钟好吧？ - 好
- You got about five minutes? - Yeah.

212
00:26:36,72 --> 00:26:38,84
嘿，我们出去看看怎么样？
Hey, do you wanna see something?

213
00:26:41,64 --> 00:26:43,77
好啊
Yeah.

214
00:26:46,52 --> 00:26:47,77
好的

215
00:28:43,26 --> 00:28:47,60
景色非常的好 我们今天玩得很高兴
That was good. We had a good time.

216
00:28:56,02 --> 00:28:58,86
我也一样
Me too.

217
00:29:03,91 --> 00:29:07,28
如果让你为难或者什么的，非常的抱歉
Sorry, if I put you on the spot or anything.

218
00:29:07,37 --> 00:29:08,91
没关系，挺好的
It's okay.

219
00:29:32,77 --> 00:29:34,56
这周末我有空
I'm not doing anything this weekend.

220
00:29:39,15 --> 00:29:41,32
如果你想要出去或者什么的
If you wanna a ride or something.

221
00:31:16,16 --> 00:31:20,67
不要担心那些碰伤和擦伤 都是玻璃纤维很好替换的
Don't worry about her bumps and bruises. Thats fiber glasses that's easily replaceable.

222
00:31:20,67 --> 00:31:23,17
我们把赞助商的介绍涂在了上面
We coat a paint  on there with sponsors detail.

223
00:31:23,25 --> 00:31:26,76
看看轮胎的纹理， 还不错吧，我们有赞助商了
Look at the thread on the tyre, still good huh, we are in business.

224
00:31:28,18 --> 00:31:30,68
你们为这个滥造花费了30万？
You paid 300 fucking grand for this piece of shit?

225
00:31:30,76 --> 00:31:32,30
是我出的钱
I paid for it.

226
00:31:32,30 --> 00:31:34,43
自掏腰包
Out of my own pocket.

227
00:31:34,43 --> 00:31:35,43
你看到的只是壳子
This is just the shell.

228
00:31:35,43 --> 00:31:38,27
里面才是关键 而不是表面
It's the inside that counts. Not the outside.

229
00:31:38,31 --> 00:31:39,31
对吧，香农？
Right, Shannon?

230
00:31:39,39 --> 00:31:40,44
的确如此
You are correct sir.

231
00:31:40,44 --> 00:31:43,44
扯他妈淡，如果我花了30万 我希望每个人都能看得出来
Fuck that shit. If I paid 300 for something. I want everybody to see it.

232
00:31:43,44 --> 00:31:44,44
当然你会这样
Of course you do.

233
00:31:44,44 --> 00:31:46,65
来我们看看这个
Now this.

234
00:31:47,65 --> 00:31:51,45
这他妈的才是一辆牛逼的车 去他娘的！

235
00:31:52,32 --> 00:31:53,58
操！
Damn!

236
00:31:53,58 --> 00:31:55,58
香农，就把这俩车卖给他吧
Shannon, sell him that car.

237
00:31:55,58 --> 00:31:59,33
妈的他就是那种在妓院都泡不到妞的人
He won't be able to find a pussy in a whorehouse.

238
00:31:59,41 --> 00:32:02,96
你知道么？ 这辆车会让你看起来更帅气
You know what? This car will make you even good looking.

239
00:32:03,54 --> 00:32:04,46
我生来就帅
I'm already good looking,pal

240
00:32:05,09 --> 00:32:06,09
进展如何？
How's it going?

241
00:32:09,80 --> 00:32:11,22
什么时候能开始我们的处女赛啊？
When's our first race?

242
00:32:13,72 --> 00:32:14,85
嗯，快了
uhh, pretty soon.

243
00:32:16,35 --> 00:32:17,60
你准备好了么？
You gonna be ready?

244
00:32:19,35 --> 00:32:20,35
希望如此
I hope so.

245
00:32:20,81 --> 00:32:22,60
靠…你希望如此
huh...I hope so.

246
00:32:22,98 --> 00:32:25,98
嘿，别装谦虚 我可是在这个上砸了不少钱
Hey,no false modesty. I got a lot of money on this.

247
00:32:28,32 --> 00:32:30,11
香农告诉过你我们是怎么认识的么？
Did Shannon ever tell you how we met?

248
00:32:33,45 --> 00:32:35,12
我以前是个制片
I used to produce movies.

249
00:32:35,12 --> 00:32:36,12
80年代的时候
In the 80's.

250
00:32:36,12 --> 00:32:40,12
常拍一些爱情动作片
Kinda like action films and sexy stuff.

251
00:32:40,12 --> 00:32:41,96
有专家称之为“欧派风格”
One critic called them 'European'.

252
00:32:42,00 --> 00:32:44,08
我自己觉就是一坨屎
I thought they were shit.

253
00:32:44,59 --> 00:32:47,50
所有的车都是他安排的 特技也是他做的
Anyway he arrange all the cars for me. Did all the stunts.

254
00:32:47,50 --> 00:32:50,09
我挺喜欢他，喜欢和他共事
I liked him. I like having him around.

255
00:32:50,13 --> 00:32:52,47
即使他他妈要价过高
Eventhough, he'd overcharge the shit out of me.

256
00:32:54,26 --> 00:32:56,26
接下来他另一笔生意
His next business venture.

257
00:32:56,26 --> 00:32:58,64
是和尼诺一伙做的
He got involved with some of Nino's friends.

258
00:32:58,64 --> 00:33:00,77
他们可是一毛不拔
They didn't go for the overcharging bit.

259
00:33:01,48 --> 00:33:03,02
他们打碎了他的盆骨
They broke his pelvis.

260
00:33:03,02 --> 00:33:05,40
他的运气太差了
He's never had a lot of luck.

261
00:33:07,65 --> 00:33:11,40
我之所以告诉你这些 是因为他对你寄予厚望
The reason I'm telling you this is, He's got a lot invested in you.

262
00:33:11,40 --> 00:33:12,91
我也一样
So do I.

263
00:33:13,91 --> 00:33:16,16
所以，如有你有任何需要… 给我打电话
So. You need anything... You call me.

264
00:33:16,28 --> 00:33:19,16
我们现在是一起的了
We're a team now.

265
00:33:21,66 --> 00:33:23,67
我很兴奋的哦
huh,I'm excited.

266
00:33:24,42 --> 00:33:26,67
尼诺 我们他妈的该走了
Nino. Get the fuck out of here

267
00:33:42,06 --> 00:33:44,06
- 看到坏人了？ - 嗯
- You see the bad guy? - Yeah.

268
00:33:44,06 --> 00:33:45,06
你怎么知道的？
How can you tell?

269
00:33:47,90 --> 00:33:49,82
他是一个骗子
Cos he's a shark.

270
00:33:50,82 --> 00:33:52,32
骗子就一定是坏人？
There's no good shark?

271
00:33:52,53 --> 00:33:55,91
不… 我的意思是仅对于他来说
No... I mean, just look at him.

272
00:33:56,32 --> 00:33:58,58
你认为他是一个好人？
Does he look like a good guy to you?

273
00:34:08,34 --> 00:34:09,42
这是辛迪


274
00:34:11,67 --> 00:34:12,21
你好


275
00:34:51,75 --> 00:34:53,71
那是我丈夫的律师
That was my hausband's lawyer.

276
00:34:54,51 --> 00:34:56,88
他不用一个星期就回来了
He's coming home in a week.

277
00:36:20,47 --> 00:36:24,97
我们在这里庆祝 说起来有点不好意思…
You know, we're here celebrating. Its a shameful thing...

278
00:36:25,85 --> 00:36:28,06
我已经做了的
what I did.

所以有很多我得弥补大家的

第二次机会是弥足珍贵的
But second chances are rare.

281
00:36:40,95 --> 00:36:42,99

你是香农的兄弟，对吧？

304

你载着我和我兄弟从棕榈泉回来

317

他们是谁？
Who are they?

00:43:54,42 --> 00:43:57,30
你他妈的能怎么做？ 你能为我去揍他们？
What the fuck are you gonna do? You gonna go and beat them out for me?

320
00:43:57,38 --> 00:43:59,68
嗯，特技演员

你他妈的为什么想知道他们是谁？
Why the fuck do you wanna know who they are?

322

有些人想让我为他们做事 但是我不想去做
There's some guy who want me to do a job for him, But I'm not gonna do it.

00:44:32,79 --> 00:44:35,71
因为我在监狱的时候欠他们保护费

那你计划怎么做？
What are you gonna do?

333
00:44:51,98 --> 00:44:53,61
问得好

334
00:44:56,86 --> 00:44:59,36
他们说他们下一步会跟踪本尼西奥和艾琳
They said they're gonna come after Benicio and Irene next.

335
00:45:22,63 --> 00:45:23,89

她只有19岁
And she was nineteen years old.

进了我的车
and saw you get in the car;

439
00:58:53,32 --> 00:58:55,32
那为什么他们只字不提？
then why didn't they say anything?

440
00:58:57,45 --> 00:58:58,70
- 我不知道

442
00:59:18,35 --> 00:59:20,47
我什么都告诉你了

00:59:26,10 --> 00:59:28,56
现在，你已经害一个小孩的父亲丧命

444
00:59:29,94 --> 00:59:31,57
而且几乎让我们丧命
and you almost got us killed.

445
00:59:32,86 --> 00:59:34,44
而现在，你还在骗我
and now, you are lying to me.

446
00:59:34,44 --> 00:59:36,61
所以，这么说吧
So, how about this?

447
00:59:37,74 --> 00:59:43,50
从现在起，从你嘴里蹦出的每个字都得是实话
From now on, every word out of your mouth is the truth.

448
00:59:43,95 --> 00:59:46,08
否则我把你往死你打
Or i'm gonna hurt you.

449
00:59:47,50 --> 00:59:49,46
明白了没有？
Do you understand?

450
00:59:50,34 --> 00:59:52,38
现在开始，库克怎么和你说的？
Now, what did Cook tell you?

451
00:59:53,63 --> 00:59:56,13
他说还会有另一辆车来劫我们道
He said there'd be another car hold us up.

452
00:59:56,22 --> 00:59:58,76
但是关于这些钱的事他什么都没有说
But he didn't say anything about all these money.

453
00:59:58,76 --> 01:00:02,01
他也没有说有人会死
he didn't say anything about anyone getting killed.

454
01:00:03,10 --> 01:00:04,98
他要宰我们?
And he was gonna rip us off?

455
01:00:12,02 --> 01:00:13,73
他得真名是啥？
What's his real name?

456
01:00:13,78 --> 01:00:16,15
他说是克里斯… 但是我叫他库克
He said it's Chris... But i just call him Cook.

457
01:00:21,53 --> 01:00:24,62
你给我领路… 现在
You're gonna take me to him... right now.

458
01:00:26,79 --> 01:00:28,42
明白没？
Do you understand?

459
01:00:28,42 --> 01:00:30,79
- 好的
- Yeah.

460
01:03:42,23 --> 01:03:43,74
你钱放哪了？
What's you do to the cash?

461
01:03:46,86 --> 01:03:47,74
我能替你保管
cause I can keep it safe for you.

462
01:03:47,87 --> 01:03:49,62
闭嘴好不
would you just stop?

463
01:03:56,50 --> 01:03:59,71
库克这个人，真名是什么？
This guy Cook, he have a real name?

464
01:03:59,75 --> 01:04:02,25

我来问问伯尼，看他知不知道
I'll ask Bernie, see if he knows him.

467
01:04:11,76 --> 01:04:14,39
天哪！ 我没有办法不想…
Jesus! I can't stop thinking about...

468
01:04:14,64 --> 01:04:16,02
我们能拿这些钱做什么
what we could do with all that dough.

469
01:04:16,48 --> 01:04:17,60
- 能不说么？ - 好吧！
- Would you stop? - Alright!

470
01:04:18,35 --> 01:04:20,65
你也知道的，许多人和结了婚的女人瞎搞
You know, a lot of guys messing around with married women...

471
01:04:20,73 --> 01:04:24,90
但是你是我知道的唯一还帮她丈夫抢钱还债的
but you're the only one I know who robs a joint, to pay back the husband.

472
01:04:25,24 --> 01:04:27,03
太疯狂了！
Crazy!

473
01:04:27,49 --> 01:04:29,03
别担心了
Don't worry about it.

474
01:04:29,03 --> 01:04:30,78
我会照顾好的
I'll take care of it.

475
01:05:01,69 --> 01:05:02,90
库克在哪？
Where's Cook?

476
01:05:03,02 --> 01:05:04,57
他在更衣室
He's in the dressing room.

477
01:05:05,94 --> 01:05:07,44
哪里？
Where's that?

478
01:05:08,07 --> 01:05:10,07
就在那
It's over there.

479
01:05:39,60 --> 01:05:41,23
我拿的是谁的钱？
Whose money do i have?

480
01:05:42,60 --> 01:05:44,19
别担心… 他们会过来取的
Don't worry... they're gonna come and get it.

481
01:05:47,57 --> 01:05:48,49
给他们打电话
Call them.

482
01:05:48,86 --> 01:05:50,45
随便谁给尼诺打个电话

01:06:02,21 --> 01:06:04,13
还记得这个么？
Do you remember this?

486
01:06:31,61 --> 01:06:34,41
不是，抱歉朋友 一会再打行么，我们关门了
No, sorry pal. Why don't you call back later, we're closed.

487
01:06:35,62 --> 01:06:38,41
我可以，但是我想如果你让他等的话 他会不安的
I could, but i think Nino would be upset that you made him wait.

488
01:06:39,66 --> 01:06:40,91
- 可以告诉我什么事情么？

493
01:06:58,76 --> 01:07:01,06
尼诺：你他妈的拿了我的东西？
Nino: You have something that fucking belongs to me.

494
01:07:07,19 --> 01:07:08,57
是这样
Seems that way.

495
01:07:11,07 --> 01:07:12,90
- 那你给我打电话…
- And you're calling me...

496
01:07:13,45 --> 01:07:15,57
- 是什么原因？
-  Why?

497
01:07:16,70 --> 01:07:19,20
- 想让老子亲自向你讨要么？
-  You're expecting to buy my own shit back from you?

498
01:07:19,28 --> 01:07:20,70
我不是讨价还价
I'm not selling it.

499
01:07:20,70 --> 01:07:24,33
我只想告诉你时间和地点 你过来取就可以了
I'm gonna give you a time and place, and you're gonna come and get it.

500
01:07:24,33 --> 01:07:26,71
明白了么？
Do you Understand?

501
01:07:28,46 --> 01:07:29,96
- 那你想得到什么好处？
- What are you getting out of it?

502
01:07:31,59 --> 01:07:32,55
很简单
Just that.

503
01:07:33,97 --> 01:07:35,34
退出
'Out of it.'

504
01:07:36,43 --> 01:07:37,97
- 你搭档没有意见？
- And your partners are happy with that?

505
01:07:40,47 --> 01:07:41,81
我没有搭档
I don't have any partners.

506
01:07:43,43 --> 01:07:46,98
- 你和别人说了么？
- you discuss this with anybody else?

507
01:07:48,36 --> 01:07:49,44
没，只是和你
No, just with you.

508
01:07:51,23 --> 01:07:53,61
- 你似乎不是很上道啊，是么？
- You're not very good at this. Are you?

509
01:08:05,21 --> 01:08:07,88
去查查他妈的是谁
go check it out who the fucking guy is?

510
01:08:46,79 --> 01:08:48,42
我可以和你说一分钟么？
Can I talk to you for a minute?

511
01:08:50,17 --> 01:08:51,67
- 没时间了，我马上出门
- I can't talk, I have to go.

512
01:08:54,92 --> 01:08:56,80
那我能和你走一段么？
Can I just walk with you...for?

513
01:09:18,65 --> 01:09:19,82
我必须告诉你些事情
I have to tell you something.

514
01:09:26,45 --> 01:09:28,96
斯坦达德在监狱的时候…
Standard was into some...

515
01:09:28,96 --> 01:09:33,34
欠了一帮人的债务
guys in prison for a lot of money.

516
01:09:35,59 --> 01:09:38,55
如果他不还，他们就会来杀了你和布尼西奥
And it would ruin you and benicio if he wouldn't pay it.

517
01:09:42,30 --> 01:09:44,05
他找我帮忙
He asked me for my help.

518
01:09:47,47 --> 01:09:50,06

钱还在我这儿
I still got the money.

如果你想要你可以拿走
You can have it, if you want to.

你可以带着布尼西奥…
You can take Benicio...and.

523
01:10:24,26 --> 01:10:27,14
我只是想说，如果你同意，我们可以离开这里

524
01:10:30,64 --> 01:10:32,64
我们可以一起走
I could come with you.

525
01:10:36,52 --> 01:10:38,36

香农，他来过我住处了

528

- 我和你说，我要问伯尼

我只想告诉他…
I just want him know that...

531
01:14:21,21 --> 01:14:24,00
你也不想这样 你对钱没兴趣
that it wasn't about that, you are not interested in the money.

532
01:14:24,08 --> 01:14:25,50
所有的这些都是为了一个女孩
and that you just did it for the girl.

533
01:14:28,63 --> 01:14:29,13
别，别
No,No

01:14:31,26 --> 01:14:32,26
你他妈把艾琳告诉他们干吗？

我要杀了你
I'll kill you

540
01:14:39,89 --> 01:14:40,48
You told him about Irene！ 怎么能告诉他们艾琳！


541
01:14:41,02 --> 01:14:43,90
听我说，我只想让他们知道…
listen,I just,I just wanted him to know that...

542
01:14:44,65 --> 01:14:48,23
你还了钱，一切都结束了 就这些
as soon as you return the money, that was the end of it.

543
01:14:48,28 --> 01:14:51,78
我不知道,我怎么知道 我怎么能知道他们要找你？！
I didn't know,how was I suppose to know How was I suppose to know that?!

544
01:14:51,78 --> 01:14:53,03
明白么？

547
01:14:58,74 --> 01:15:01,16
How was I suppose to know everything led to Nino！? 我怎么知道这一切都是尼诺策划的？！

我已经给了你建议
I already gave you my advice.

558
01:15:55,93 --> 01:15:58,85
你应该去拿了钱，别理那人
You should've taken the money, and left the guy alone.

559
01:15:58,97 --> 01:16:00,10
- 伯尼，不是那么简单的
- It's just not that simple Bernie.

560
01:16:00,18 --> 01:16:03,06
不简单！当然不简单！ 现在自食其果了吧
No! of course not! Now everything's bounced up in your face!

565
01:16:15,36 --> 01:16:16,61
我有小道消息…
I got tipped off...

566
01:16:16,74 --> 01:16:20,99
他把钱藏在了已将典当行 他要来洛杉矶投资的
he was stashing a million bucks in a pawn shop; He's gonna invest it here in L.A

567
01:16:21,12 --> 01:16:23,00
这样就会是我们的一个有力的竞争对手
He was gonna set up a rival operation.

568
01:16:23,12 --> 01:16:25,71
所以，你就想A东岸帮派的钱？
So, you stole from the east-coast mob?

569
01:16:25,83 --> 01:16:28,63
不！我是从一些跳梁小丑手里偷的
Now! I stole from some jump up punk.

570
01:16:28,83 --> 01:16:30,84
他想先于我们行动
who's trying to step on our action.

571
01:16:30,88 --> 01:16:35,34
好吧…那在你设计这个假抢劫案之前 为什么不和我商议一下？
Yeah... then why didn't you come to me, before you set up this dummy robbery?

572
01:16:36,76 --> 01:16:38,76
还雇佣了这么一批垃圾
Before you hire this piece of shit.

573
01:16:38,76 --> 01:16:41,64
伯尼，这是我这边的事 我不想把你也卷进来
This was something off to the side, Bernie. I didn't wanna involve you on this.

574
01:16:41,64 --> 01:16:43,60
好吧，现在我已经被卷进来了！
Well, I'm involved now!

575
01:16:45,85 --> 01:16:47,52
听我说…
Let me tell you something...

576
01:16:47,52 --> 01:16:54,74
任何人…无论是谁！ 发现你从团伙里偷了钱，我们死定了
Anybody...anybody! Finds out you stole from the family, we are both dead.

577
01:16:54,90 --> 01:16:57,11
什么他妈的家族
What fucking family?

578
01:16:57,91 --> 01:17:01,03
是一家人还会叫我有太杂种？
The family who still calls me a fucking kike?

579
01:17:01,66 --> 01:17:03,54
就当着我的面说！
To my face!

580
01:17:04,54 --> 01:17:09,92
伯尼，你也知道，我已经59了 他们仍然当我是崽子一样，揉我的脸
You know, I'm fifty nine years old Bernie, they still pinched my cheek like i'm some fucking kid.

581
01:17:11,25 --> 01:17:12,25
家族
Family.

582
01:17:12,63 --> 01:17:15,01
那些钱总会浮出水面的，放松些
The money flows up, easy.

583
01:17:15,38 --> 01:17:17,63
你也知道的
You know that.

584
01:17:18,43 --> 01:17:20,80
伯尼，这就是为什么这个车手必须死
That's why this driver's gotta go, Bernie.

585
01:17:21,55 --> 01:17:23,43
他必须死
He's gotta go.

586
01:17:23,43 --> 01:17:25,56
你的伙伴，香农也是
and your pal, Shannon.

587
01:17:25,56 --> 01:17:29,06
就是这两个人，把我牵扯进去的
it's these two guys, that can tie me to this rob

588
01:18:08,85 --> 01:18:11,48
现在，轮你来处理后事了
Now, it's your turn to clean up after me.

589
01:19:15,13 --> 01:19:16,88
这里值么多值钱的汽车…
All this priceless cars...

590
01:19:17,17 --> 01:19:19,67
别人都以为你大门锁的紧紧的
One would think you'd have better locks.

591
01:19:21,63 --> 01:19:25,39
这里的门总是向你开放的
alright…Doors is always open to you.

592
01:19:25,55 --> 01:19:27,55
要出门？
Going somewhere?

593
01:19:28,93 --> 01:19:34,14
我也在考虑啊
ah…I was thinking about it.

594
01:19:35,19 --> 01:19:37,81
我在寻找你的车手
I'm looking for your driver.

595
01:19:39,65 --> 01:19:42,07
你闯进这儿，我想不会有什么好事
You breaking in here, I figure its bad news.

596
01:19:42,15 --> 01:19:43,32
不，香农
No, Shannon.

597
01:19:43,78 --> 01:19:44,45
是大难临头
It's bad luck.

598
01:19:46,41 --> 01:19:50,04
在这个城市，一年发生2000起抢劫
Two thousand heist a year in this city

599
01:19:50,04 --> 01:19:51,91
他就非抢不该抢的人
he has to pick the wrong one.

600
01:19:52,58 --> 01:19:54,16
他想把它做好
He tried to put it right.

601
01:19:54,29 --> 01:19:56,08
好吧，那就是你也选错了人
Well, he picked the wrong guy for that too.

602
01:19:56,58 --> 01:20:00,59
我的搭档就是好战的混蛋 特别是走投无路的时候
My partner is a belligerent asshole, with his back against the wall.

603
01:20:01,46 --> 01:20:03,47
现在，我也一样了
Right now, so am I.

604
01:20:04,34 --> 01:20:06,84
如果我不把这个处理好 我就麻烦了
If I don't set this straight, I'm in big trouble.

605
01:20:10,68 --> 01:20:12,85
你知道他可能在哪么？
Any idea where he might be?

606
01:20:15,44 --> 01:20:16,98
墨西哥
Mexico.

607
01:20:17,56 --> 01:20:20,36
也可能在伯利兹城
or maybe it was Balize.

608
01:20:23,44 --> 01:20:24,99
真的么？
really?

609
01:20:31,45 --> 01:20:34,75
我对整件事兴奋不已
I was excited about this whole thing.

610
01:20:34,87 --> 01:20:37,12
我的名字印在了车上

611
01:20:37,37 --> 01:20:39,63
我的意思是，看起来多漂亮啊
I mean, look how beautiful.

612
01:20:40,34 --> 01:20:42,84
我想让我的名字在车上
I wanted to see my name on this thing.

613
01:20:45,13 --> 01:20:47,63
我想我们需要继续我们的合作
I think we would've made a go with this business.

614
01:21:03,23 --> 01:21:04,03
别急
Don't worry.

615
01:21:04,11 --> 01:21:05,15
别激动
Don't worry.

616
01:21:05,15 --> 01:21:06,15
已经完了
That's it.

617
01:21:06,24 --> 01:21:10,28
结束了，不痛的 真的，结束了
It's done. There is no pain, its over. Its over.
