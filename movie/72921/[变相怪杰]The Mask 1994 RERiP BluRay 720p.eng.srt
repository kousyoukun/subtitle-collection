1
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:44,826
"Edge City"

2
00:00:48,497 --> 00:00:50,226
Another one coming down

3
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:51,592
Hang on

4
00:01:37,713 --> 00:01:41,513
THE MASK

5
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:55,597
I got those...

6
00:01:55,665 --> 00:01:56,825
concert tickets you wanted

7
00:01:56,932 --> 00:01:58,263
You're kidding!

8
00:01:58,334 --> 00:02:00,131
For Friday night?

9
00:02:00,236 --> 00:02:03,103
Stanley, this is great

10
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,837
What time do I pick you up?

11
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:07,841
Here's the thing

12
00:02:07,943 --> 00:02:11,674
My best girlfriend is here and she'd die to go to this...

13
00:02:11,747 --> 00:02:14,545
so could we get an extra ticket for her?

14
00:02:16,118 --> 00:02:19,884
They're sold out. That means there's no more

15
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,089
I can't let her sit home all alone

16
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:28,128
I'll tell you what

17
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,754
Go with your friend

18
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,226
I couldn't do that

19
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:34,803
No, come on

20
00:02:36,172 --> 00:02:38,333
Stanley, you are the nicest guy

21
00:02:38,574 --> 00:02:40,633
Really, you are

22
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:44,543
- Isn't he the nicest guy? - The best

23
00:02:48,384 --> 00:02:51,182
That was the most sickening display

24
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:54,848
- I've ever seen. - I disagree

25
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:56,584
I'm wearing her down

26
00:02:56,692 --> 00:02:59,923
Buddy, you need a little change of pace

27
00:03:00,029 --> 00:03:02,930
Tonight, I'll take you on a love safari

28
00:03:03,032 --> 00:03:06,365
Deep into the darkest heart of the urban jungle

29
00:03:06,635 --> 00:03:08,603
Tell me more, bwana

30
00:03:08,704 --> 00:03:12,367
The Coco Bongo CIub. Hottest new joint in town

31
00:03:12,608 --> 00:03:15,008
Only the cr me de la cr me need apply

32
00:03:16,312 --> 00:03:18,280
- How do we get in? - Are you kidding?

33
00:03:18,381 --> 00:03:20,781
Leave it to me. Trust me, buddy

34
00:03:20,883 --> 00:03:23,044
This will be the perfect...

35
00:03:23,152 --> 00:03:25,382
night on the town

36
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:40,126
Hold the phone

37
00:03:40,236 --> 00:03:43,330
Killer at three o'clock

38
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,428
Stand back and observe

39
00:04:18,674 --> 00:04:20,039
Where do I open an account?

40
00:04:20,142 --> 00:04:21,905
New accounts,right here

41
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,377
You're Iucky, I was on my way out--

42
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,141
Hold this for me, please?

43
00:04:26,215 --> 00:04:28,376
I'll hold anything you want

44
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,920
Can you help me?

45
00:04:58,314 --> 00:04:59,804
So...

46
00:05:00,783 --> 00:05:03,047
what kind of account do you want?

47
00:05:03,118 --> 00:05:07,350
Well, I'm not sure exactly. I'm just terrible with things like that

48
00:05:08,357 --> 00:05:10,825
That's an interesting tie, Mister...

49
00:05:10,926 --> 00:05:13,224
Ipkiss, Stanley Ipkiss

50
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:14,921
Tina Carlyle, it's a pleasure

51
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,793
Pleasure's all mine

52
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:18,765
May I?

53
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:20,131
What?

54
00:05:20,202 --> 00:05:22,067
I'm such a mess

55
00:05:22,938 --> 00:05:24,803
Oh, of course

56
00:05:26,175 --> 00:05:28,075
That's what they're there for

57
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:33,339
As I was saying, that tie...

58
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:37,385
reminds me of those, what do you call it, ink blot tests

59
00:05:37,486 --> 00:05:40,421
- A Rorschach test. - Right

60
00:05:40,489 --> 00:05:42,787
It sort of looks like...

61
00:05:43,993 --> 00:05:45,722
a young woman riding bareback

62
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:47,796
Sort of...

63
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:49,296
Lady Godiva or something

64
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:52,265
Of course

65
00:05:52,368 --> 00:05:55,860
What do you see, Mr. Ipkiss?

66
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,870
I don't know

67
00:06:12,154 --> 00:06:13,917
Bright colors...

68
00:06:14,023 --> 00:06:15,422
It's a power tie

69
00:06:15,524 --> 00:06:17,321
Supposed to make you feel...

70
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:19,451
powerful

71
00:06:19,562 --> 00:06:21,029
Does it work?

72
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:29,264
Now, how about that account?

73
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:30,463
We have...

74
00:06:30,573 --> 00:06:32,768
several different plans

75
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,103
Savings

76
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,779
Checking

77
00:06:39,882 --> 00:06:41,315
Savings and checking

78
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:43,578
Savings and CD's

79
00:06:43,852 --> 00:06:45,080
Checking and CD's

80
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:48,054
Savings, checking and CD's. T-Bills

81
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:51,024
Or we can throw your money in a big mattress

82
00:06:56,465 --> 00:06:59,161
Now, I have some forms for you to fill out

83
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:11,036
That's it, sweetheart. Now just a little bit to the right

84
00:07:11,146 --> 00:07:13,046
Keep it down back there

85
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,847
We'll try

86
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:19,045
- What do you think? - Layout's not bad. But...

87
00:07:19,154 --> 00:07:22,055
the motion detectors are a pain

88
00:07:22,124 --> 00:07:24,319
But you can pulI this off, right?

89
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:27,327
You talking to the Doctor

90
00:07:27,429 --> 00:07:29,329
I do have one question

91
00:07:29,431 --> 00:07:31,228
Which is?

92
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,893
What's Niko have to say about this?

93
00:07:34,003 --> 00:07:35,402
Nothing

94
00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:39,338
- This isn't his grift. - Get real, man

95
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:41,306
Everything is his grift

96
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:45,575
He owns you, he owns this cIub, he owns this whole stinking town

97
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:49,117
Things change

98
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:53,086
You mess with Niko, you end up taking a dirt nap

99
00:07:54,556 --> 00:07:56,922
He's the only one who's napping...

100
00:07:59,094 --> 00:08:01,585
and I'm about to give him a serious wake-up call

101
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:03,927
But we need cash...

102
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:06,228
so first we take the bank...

103
00:08:06,335 --> 00:08:07,666
then we take Niko...

104
00:08:07,936 --> 00:08:10,131
and then, my friend, school is out

105
00:08:11,306 --> 00:08:14,537
And this whole city is our playground

106
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:22,914
Bub, watch where you're going!

107
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:40,127
Hang on, hang on!

108
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,405
Don't get your panties in a twist

109
00:08:43,505 --> 00:08:45,632
What the hell is it?

110
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:48,005
I don't know...

111
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,237
about seven hundred bucks, eh?

112
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:54,072
Now, what can I do for you, bub?

113
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:56,117
I'm here for the Civic

114
00:08:56,185 --> 00:09:00,019
The brake drums are shot and you need a new transmission

115
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,646
What?!

116
00:09:01,757 --> 00:09:03,918
All I wanted was an oil change

117
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:08,122
Lucky we caught these problems before they caused serious trouble

118
00:09:09,198 --> 00:09:12,099
Sign right here, and press down hard

119
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,668
- There's no price. - There will be

120
00:09:16,972 --> 00:09:19,338
I've no car. I need a car tonight

121
00:09:21,643 --> 00:09:23,941
Bring around the loaner

122
00:09:24,012 --> 00:09:25,673
The loaner?

123
00:09:25,781 --> 00:09:27,976
The loaner?

124
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,541
It's a classic

125
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:13,156
Gals, meet my buddy Stanley Ipkiss

126
00:10:13,262 --> 00:10:16,561
Humungo in the banking business

127
00:10:16,665 --> 00:10:18,758
- Not really. - Let's get in this joint

128
00:10:21,303 --> 00:10:23,771
How you doing, buddy?

129
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:26,633
- It's Charlie! - How you doing?

130
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:29,336
- How you doing, my friend? - Long time no see

131
00:10:29,444 --> 00:10:32,072
Good to see you

132
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:33,773
Come on, gals

133
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:36,040
See you on the inside

134
00:10:45,327 --> 00:10:47,318
This is a mistake

135
00:10:50,365 --> 00:10:53,300
You crossed the rope. Never cross the rope

136
00:10:53,368 --> 00:10:56,462
- My friends are inside. - Lose him

137
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,301
This isn't fair

138
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,567
Watch it, I'm a bleeder

139
00:10:59,675 --> 00:11:02,803
Put me down now, or I am never coming back here

140
00:11:13,355 --> 00:11:15,289
Jeez

141
00:11:29,204 --> 00:11:31,297
Mr. Ipkiss!

142
00:11:31,406 --> 00:11:33,101
Hi

143
00:11:34,776 --> 00:11:35,868
Are you okay?

144
00:11:36,144 --> 00:11:37,611
Me?

145
00:11:37,713 --> 00:11:39,078
I'm great.

146
00:11:39,147 --> 00:11:40,079
Really good

147
00:11:40,148 --> 00:11:42,309
I never felt better, really

148
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:44,408
I'm just...

149
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:45,679
catching some air

150
00:11:45,787 --> 00:11:47,652
Your car, sir

151
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,157
That's not my car

152
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:51,692
It matches the ticket

153
00:11:55,731 --> 00:11:57,323
AIright...

154
00:11:57,432 --> 00:11:59,400
I'll take it

155
00:12:00,602 --> 00:12:03,298
But I am very angry!

156
00:12:04,806 --> 00:12:06,364
Believe this?

157
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:09,908
You drive in in a Porsche...

158
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:55,214
Hey, Mister!

159
00:13:58,487 --> 00:13:59,954
Hold on!

160
00:14:00,989 --> 00:14:03,150
I know CPR!

161
00:14:41,229 --> 00:14:42,161
Hey, you!

162
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,824
What are you doing down there?

163
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:49,399
I'm just looking for...

164
00:14:50,872 --> 00:14:52,362
my mask!

165
00:14:53,575 --> 00:14:55,202
I got it

166
00:15:04,219 --> 00:15:07,518
Do you have any idea what time it is?

167
00:15:07,622 --> 00:15:09,351
Actually, no

168
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,825
My new carpet!

169
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:17,558
Well ,this is coming right out of your security deposit

170
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:19,795
You know...

171
00:15:19,901 --> 00:15:20,959
What?

172
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,907
Nothing

173
00:15:26,007 --> 00:15:29,306
Well, that's what you are, Ipkiss, a big nothing

174
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:37,417
Aren't you due at the lab to get your bolts tightened?

175
00:15:39,154 --> 00:15:41,247
I should have said that

176
00:15:48,563 --> 00:15:50,531
Hey, you

177
00:15:50,632 --> 00:15:52,463
Milo!

178
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:56,196
No jumping up allowed. It's against doggie ordinance

179
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:22,622
What do you want?

180
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,525
You want me to throw that?

181
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:26,260
I'm very tired

182
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:29,132
I'll throw it one time

183
00:16:29,204 --> 00:16:32,196
I won't throw it with you attached to it

184
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,435
You ready?

185
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:39,138
Get it

186
00:16:39,247 --> 00:16:40,339
Ipkiss!

187
00:16:40,448 --> 00:16:42,643
Turn down those cartoons!

188
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,284
AIright, Mrs. Peenman!

189
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:54,085
Dr. Neuman, you say that everybody wears a mask?

190
00:16:54,196 --> 00:16:55,925
That's correct

191
00:16:56,031 --> 00:16:58,966
We all wear masks, metaphorically speaking

192
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:02,036
We suppress the id, our darkest desires...

193
00:17:02,137 --> 00:17:05,072
and adopt a more socially acceptable image

194
00:17:05,173 --> 00:17:09,371
The book is "The Masks We Wear" by Dr. Arthur Neuman

195
00:17:09,444 --> 00:17:11,241
Thank you for being here

196
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,543
What's the matter with you?

197
00:17:17,652 --> 00:17:18,914
What is it?

198
00:17:20,355 --> 00:17:22,186
What are you looking for?

199
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,225
You like this thing? You like it?

200
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:29,095
"The Masks We Wear"

201
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,397
"That's correct

202
00:17:33,468 --> 00:17:37,097
We all wear masks, metaphorically speaking"

203
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:47,278
Yeah, right

204
00:18:27,255 --> 00:18:28,984
Smoking!

205
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,051
It's party time

206
00:18:33,161 --> 00:18:34,594
P-A-R-T-Y

207
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,756
Why? Because I gotta

208
00:18:44,906 --> 00:18:46,601
MANAGER

209
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,300
QUIET PLEASE

210
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:23,709
Snooze!

211
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:52,096
Look, ma, I'm road kill!

212
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:04,346
- Get out of the road! - I think he wants to communicate

213
00:20:05,987 --> 00:20:07,215
squeeze me gently

214
00:20:25,273 --> 00:20:26,205
Hey, mister...

215
00:20:26,307 --> 00:20:28,241
you got the time?

216
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:30,937
As a matter of fact, I do, Cubbie!

217
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:36,278
Look at that!

218
00:20:36,384 --> 00:20:40,616
Time to honk your nose and pulI your underwear over your head

219
00:20:47,195 --> 00:20:48,822
Come on!

220
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,833
Step right up here, don't be shy!

221
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,032
Nobody likes...

222
00:21:00,141 --> 00:21:02,336
a bashful leather head

223
00:21:02,444 --> 00:21:03,638
Move it!

224
00:21:03,745 --> 00:21:06,009
For my first trick...

225
00:21:07,081 --> 00:21:09,345
I'll do something for you, son

226
00:21:12,487 --> 00:21:17,015
We have a giraffe. There you go, son. Now get out of here, you bother me

227
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,128
Now...

228
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,121
Sorry, wrong pocket

229
00:21:24,232 --> 00:21:25,426
For you...

230
00:21:26,935 --> 00:21:28,425
a little body English

231
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,831
A French poodle

232
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:39,072
The dog was rabid, had to put it down

233
00:21:40,381 --> 00:21:43,248
At last but not least, my favorite

234
00:21:54,929 --> 00:21:56,954
A Tommy gun

235
00:22:09,277 --> 00:22:11,211
This is incredible

236
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:13,941
With these powers I could be...

237
00:22:16,784 --> 00:22:18,911
a superhero

238
00:22:18,987 --> 00:22:21,046
I'd fight crime, protect the innocent...

239
00:22:21,155 --> 00:22:24,818
work for world peace

240
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,393
But first...

241
00:22:27,762 --> 00:22:29,730
RIPLEY'S AUTO FINISHING

242
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:36,300
Hold onto your Iug nuts...

243
00:22:36,404 --> 00:22:39,339
it's time for an overhaul

244
00:23:25,386 --> 00:23:27,354
It was a dream

245
00:23:29,223 --> 00:23:31,350
It was a dream

246
00:23:35,263 --> 00:23:37,254
I must lay off the cartoons

247
00:23:48,509 --> 00:23:52,309
Lt. Kellaway. You know anything about the disturbance last night?

248
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:56,107
Disturbance?

249
00:23:56,217 --> 00:23:59,345
Some prowler broke in and attacked Mrs. Peenman

250
00:23:59,454 --> 00:24:00,978
Attacked?

251
00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:02,579
You didn't hear anything?

252
00:24:02,857 --> 00:24:07,055
She unloaded a couple of rounds of buckshot 5 feet from here

253
00:24:07,161 --> 00:24:09,220
Look at the floor

254
00:24:09,297 --> 00:24:11,857
He put that right in my floor, then he jumped out...

255
00:24:11,966 --> 00:24:15,299
the window. Officer, are you writing notes?

256
00:24:15,403 --> 00:24:17,200
This is...

257
00:24:17,305 --> 00:24:18,397
impossible

258
00:24:18,506 --> 00:24:21,339
Those pyjamas are impossible. This happened

259
00:24:22,677 --> 00:24:25,145
See, I have...

260
00:24:25,246 --> 00:24:27,339
an inner ear problem

261
00:24:29,017 --> 00:24:31,542
- Sometimes I can't hear anything. - Is that so?

262
00:24:34,989 --> 00:24:39,289
Here's my card. If you recall anything unusual about last night...

263
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,988
anything at all, call me

264
00:24:42,096 --> 00:24:43,586
You bet. Thank you

265
00:24:43,698 --> 00:24:45,893
And good Iuck...

266
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:48,194
cracking the case

267
00:25:01,449 --> 00:25:03,940
Oh, my God, I'm late!

268
00:25:05,153 --> 00:25:07,178
Keys, keys...

269
00:25:07,288 --> 00:25:09,085
Where's the keys?

270
00:25:10,358 --> 00:25:11,382
Damn

271
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,325
Get the keys

272
00:25:14,395 --> 00:25:15,521
Find them

273
00:25:19,133 --> 00:25:20,691
Get the keys

274
00:25:28,943 --> 00:25:31,468
I am so late

275
00:25:33,347 --> 00:25:35,611
Good boy

276
00:25:35,683 --> 00:25:39,050
Come on, Milo. Give them to me. Drop it

277
00:26:10,351 --> 00:26:13,479
I want a proctologist standing by

278
00:26:13,554 --> 00:26:15,545
The best one you can find

279
00:26:15,656 --> 00:26:18,489
Can you tell me what happened?

280
00:26:18,593 --> 00:26:22,359
- No, you can quote me. - Looks like some Mob tactic

281
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:26,696
She broke the case. Come on, get these rubbernecks out of here

282
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:38,873
Where were you last night? We looked all over for you

283
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,881
Did you happen to look outside, in the gutter?

284
00:26:41,983 --> 00:26:43,575
Did you check the paper?

285
00:26:43,684 --> 00:26:45,515
Your girlfriend got a great review

286
00:26:45,586 --> 00:26:47,577
Bombshell Explodes at Coco Bongo

287
00:26:47,688 --> 00:26:50,521
You're 50 minutes late. That's like stealing

288
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:55,187
I'm sorry, Mr. Dickey. It'll never happen again. I've been a jerk

289
00:26:55,296 --> 00:26:58,094
If you weren't busy oogling girlie pictures...

290
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:00,566
you might get some work done

291
00:27:00,668 --> 00:27:04,297
Sir. She's a perspective client of Stanley's

292
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,870
Really?

293
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,672
The next time she comes in...

294
00:27:12,747 --> 00:27:14,112
send her to my office

295
00:27:16,617 --> 00:27:17,549
You bet

296
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:24,750
Gee, I wish "my" daddy owned a bank

297
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:28,056
Then I could be a rich little creep too

298
00:27:28,162 --> 00:27:30,027
You think she'll ever come back?

299
00:27:30,131 --> 00:27:33,760
Oh, man, forget her. Listen to me

300
00:27:33,868 --> 00:27:37,326
Girls like her always look for the BBD: Bigger Better Deal

301
00:27:37,605 --> 00:27:39,800
You don't know that

302
00:27:39,907 --> 00:27:42,899
She's an artist. She's...

303
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,137
- sensitive. - Forget her

304
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:49,273
She'll rip out your heart, put it in a blender and hit "frappe"

305
00:27:49,383 --> 00:27:53,251
You don't need her. You need somebody down to earth

306
00:27:53,321 --> 00:27:57,553
Somebody with some integrity. Somebody with...

307
00:27:57,658 --> 00:27:58,818
red hair...

308
00:27:58,926 --> 00:28:00,791
fulI, pouting lips...

309
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:03,126
a white blouse, green jacket...

310
00:28:03,197 --> 00:28:04,562
and a name tag

311
00:28:04,665 --> 00:28:06,826
You really narrowed it down

312
00:28:06,934 --> 00:28:09,027
Too bad she's already taken

313
00:28:11,138 --> 00:28:13,663
Hello there, may I be of assistance?

314
00:28:13,774 --> 00:28:15,742
Stanley Ipkiss?

315
00:28:18,813 --> 00:28:21,281
Hi! I'm Peggy Brandt from the Tribune

316
00:28:24,018 --> 00:28:27,215
I canceled my subscription because they kept stealing--

317
00:28:27,321 --> 00:28:30,154
No, actually, I want to ask you a few questions

318
00:28:30,258 --> 00:28:32,954
Really? About what?

319
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,757
Ripley Auto Finishing. You're a customer, aren't you?

320
00:28:39,767 --> 00:28:40,961
Me?

321
00:28:41,903 --> 00:28:44,030
I don't even have a car

322
00:28:44,138 --> 00:28:46,766
You know, 'cause they pollute

323
00:28:46,874 --> 00:28:49,240
You don't own an '89 Civic?

324
00:28:51,712 --> 00:28:53,612
Oh, that car, yeah

325
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,118
It's coming back to me

326
00:28:58,219 --> 00:29:00,710
Miss... What was your name?

327
00:29:00,821 --> 00:29:02,015
Peggy Brandt

328
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,248
Wait a minute

329
00:29:04,358 --> 00:29:06,087
Peggy Brandt?

330
00:29:06,193 --> 00:29:07,751
Of "Ask Peggy"?

331
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,627
That's right

332
00:29:10,731 --> 00:29:13,427
You printed one of my letters last year

333
00:29:13,701 --> 00:29:16,067
Remember? "Nice Guys Finish Last."

334
00:29:17,305 --> 00:29:18,738
You're Mister Nice Guy?

335
00:29:20,007 --> 00:29:25,343
Do you realize how much mail we got about that letter?

336
00:29:25,446 --> 00:29:28,847
100's of women are looking for a guy like you

337
00:29:30,952 --> 00:29:33,045
Really?

338
00:29:33,154 --> 00:29:36,248
You know how hard it is to find a decent man in this town?

339
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:39,053
Most think monogamy is a kind of wood

340
00:29:43,965 --> 00:29:46,900
Why are you covering this story?

341
00:29:47,001 --> 00:29:50,732
Because "Dear Peggy" pays dick. I'm starving to death

342
00:29:50,838 --> 00:29:52,931
I'm looking to become a real reporter

343
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,999
When you were at Ripley Auto did you see anything suspicious?

344
00:29:57,111 --> 00:29:58,237
Anything?

345
00:29:58,346 --> 00:30:00,280
I won't make trouble for you

346
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:01,939
I just want the truth

347
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:07,252
God, I wish I knew the truth. You know, I really do

348
00:30:10,424 --> 00:30:13,120
If you think of anything...

349
00:30:13,227 --> 00:30:15,092
this is my number

350
00:30:15,896 --> 00:30:16,954
This is my...

351
00:30:17,064 --> 00:30:19,396
you know, personal number

352
00:30:21,769 --> 00:30:24,135
100's of women are looking for a guy like me?

353
00:30:24,238 --> 00:30:25,500
Sure

354
00:30:26,807 --> 00:30:28,434
I'm one of them

355
00:30:36,484 --> 00:30:38,918
120 yards

356
00:30:44,525 --> 00:30:45,753
Hello, Dorian

357
00:30:49,263 --> 00:30:51,527
Thanks for dropping by

358
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:56,031
Next time, call. Leave the delivery boys at home

359
00:31:17,024 --> 00:31:19,049
The cops...

360
00:31:19,326 --> 00:31:22,989
tried to shut the cIub down this morning

361
00:31:23,064 --> 00:31:27,763
They say you've been using the place to run your own small-time scams

362
00:31:27,868 --> 00:31:30,428
When I hear things like that...

363
00:31:30,538 --> 00:31:33,871
I start losing my concentration

364
00:31:33,974 --> 00:31:36,670
My game...

365
00:31:36,777 --> 00:31:39,837
it goes straight to hell

366
00:31:42,016 --> 00:31:44,610
You could too

367
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,311
205 yards

368
00:31:48,422 --> 00:31:50,481
I'm fed up with you...

369
00:31:51,425 --> 00:31:52,756
but....

370
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,521
I'll cut you a break

371
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:59,099
One week to get out of town

372
00:31:59,366 --> 00:32:01,391
After that...

373
00:32:01,469 --> 00:32:05,997
I'll use your empty little skulI to break in my new nine iron

374
00:32:46,447 --> 00:32:47,914
Are you okay?

375
00:32:48,015 --> 00:32:50,609
Your car, sir

376
00:32:54,121 --> 00:32:56,055
I am now

377
00:33:13,774 --> 00:33:16,402
Tina, come on

378
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,011
You can't

379
00:33:20,014 --> 00:33:21,606
You can't

380
00:33:25,219 --> 00:33:26,652
Go on

381
00:33:28,155 --> 00:33:30,749
I don't believe it

382
00:33:50,644 --> 00:33:52,475
Stupid

383
00:33:54,215 --> 00:33:56,115
She would never...

384
00:34:22,142 --> 00:34:24,076
No way!

385
00:34:52,806 --> 00:34:54,637
Hold on, Sugar

386
00:34:54,742 --> 00:34:57,870
Daddy's got a sweet tooth tonight

387
00:35:14,628 --> 00:35:17,119
Somebody,stop me

388
00:35:22,136 --> 00:35:24,900
Can't make the scene if you don't have the green

389
00:35:25,005 --> 00:35:27,132
I better make a little stop

390
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:37,540
EDGE CITY POWER "SERVICE WORTH WAITING FOR"

391
00:35:37,618 --> 00:35:39,142
How's it going, Freeze?

392
00:35:39,253 --> 00:35:40,777
It's looking good here

393
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:45,086
You're on your own. I must go downstairs, make sure I'm seen

394
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:46,183
Do it

395
00:35:46,293 --> 00:35:49,820
The doctor is about to operate

396
00:36:13,153 --> 00:36:15,849
Sorry, fellas. Waste not, want not

397
00:36:27,067 --> 00:36:28,295
Cops!

398
00:36:39,146 --> 00:36:41,876
Not on the list, not in the cIub

399
00:36:58,732 --> 00:37:00,063
How do?

400
00:37:06,106 --> 00:37:07,300
You on the list?

401
00:37:07,408 --> 00:37:12,675
No, but I believe my friends are. Perhaps you know them?

402
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,270
Franklin, Grant...

403
00:37:14,381 --> 00:37:15,780
and Jackson

404
00:37:21,955 --> 00:37:25,686
That's it! No one gets in

405
00:37:29,396 --> 00:37:33,059
Now we present the most beautiful flower of the Congo Bongo...

406
00:37:33,133 --> 00:37:35,226
Miss Tina Carlyle

407
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:51,277
Beautiful

408
00:37:53,086 --> 00:37:56,021
Love makes me treat you...

409
00:37:56,123 --> 00:37:59,456
The way that I do Gee, baby...

410
00:37:59,726 --> 00:38:02,923
ain't I good to you

411
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:06,056
There's nothing too good...

412
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:08,760
for a boy that's so true

413
00:38:08,836 --> 00:38:12,932
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

414
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,441
I bought you a fur coat for Christmas

415
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:19,110
A diamond ring...

416
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,010
a Cadillac car...

417
00:38:21,114 --> 00:38:24,174
And everything

418
00:38:24,284 --> 00:38:27,048
Love makes me treat you...

419
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,418
the way that I do

420
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:32,391
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

421
00:38:34,394 --> 00:38:37,693
Love makes me treat you...

422
00:38:37,798 --> 00:38:39,959
the way that I do

423
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:43,059
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

424
00:38:44,738 --> 00:38:47,730
There's nothing too good...

425
00:38:47,841 --> 00:38:50,708
for a man so true

426
00:38:50,811 --> 00:38:53,371
Gee,baby, ain't I good to you

427
00:38:55,048 --> 00:39:00,213
I know how to make a man happy I'll treat you right

428
00:39:03,156 --> 00:39:05,317
- Why are you here? - There's trouble

429
00:39:05,425 --> 00:39:07,017
You better come upstairs

430
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,889
Come on, let's go

431
00:39:15,502 --> 00:39:18,335
They got me paying taxes...

432
00:39:18,438 --> 00:39:20,201
for what I gave to you

433
00:39:20,307 --> 00:39:24,243
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

434
00:39:44,932 --> 00:39:47,492
Let's rock this joint

435
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,841
Smoking

436
00:41:04,911 --> 00:41:06,242
What happened?

437
00:41:09,449 --> 00:41:11,610
Someone hit the joint before us

438
00:41:13,286 --> 00:41:14,583
Get that, Doc

439
00:41:16,089 --> 00:41:18,182
Suck on that

440
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,195
Son of a bitch!

441
00:41:29,369 --> 00:41:30,961
Who did this, man?

442
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,663
Who?!

443
00:41:33,607 --> 00:41:35,006
Him!

444
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:37,543
That's the guy

445
00:41:37,644 --> 00:41:40,044
The guy dancing with Tina?

446
00:41:40,113 --> 00:41:41,910
He's dead meat

447
00:41:42,015 --> 00:41:43,107
Come on

448
00:42:24,758 --> 00:42:26,555
I want this place cleared now

449
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:47,709
CIub's closed. Move it! You think I'm joking? Come on, move it!

450
00:42:47,981 --> 00:42:49,972
Party's over, let's go!

451
00:42:50,617 --> 00:42:52,016
Get out of here

452
00:42:53,553 --> 00:42:54,485
Get lost!

453
00:42:56,022 --> 00:42:57,649
Okay, Twinkle Toes

454
00:42:57,724 --> 00:43:00,249
Where is my money, tell me now

455
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,769
You've got 17.5% in T-bills amortized over the fiscal year

456
00:43:10,036 --> 00:43:11,196
8% in stocks and bonds

457
00:43:11,304 --> 00:43:13,738
Carry the 9, divide by the GNP...

458
00:43:14,007 --> 00:43:17,443
Fortunately, funeral bouquets are deductible

459
00:43:18,378 --> 00:43:20,039
Ice this deadbeat

460
00:43:26,453 --> 00:43:27,385
Shoot him!

461
00:43:32,759 --> 00:43:33,657
Thanks

462
00:43:41,468 --> 00:43:44,062
You got me, partner

463
00:43:56,082 --> 00:43:58,778
Hold me close,Red

464
00:43:59,052 --> 00:44:00,713
It's getting dark

465
00:44:06,059 --> 00:44:08,653
Tell Auntie Em to let OId Yeller out

466
00:44:12,866 --> 00:44:16,029
Tell Tiny Tim I won't be coming home this Christmas

467
00:44:20,674 --> 00:44:22,733
Tell Scarlet I do give a damn

468
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,312
Pardon me

469
00:44:37,123 --> 00:44:38,590
Thank you

470
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,620
You love me

471
00:44:41,695 --> 00:44:44,664
You really love me

472
00:44:50,537 --> 00:44:52,698
You're not going anywhere

473
00:44:59,312 --> 00:45:00,745
Drop it, Tyrel!

474
00:45:05,785 --> 00:45:07,275
Drop it

475
00:45:09,356 --> 00:45:12,917
You got a warrant? Or did you come for a nightcap?

476
00:45:14,227 --> 00:45:16,923
What I got is probable cause

477
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:19,294
Your boys knocked over Edge City Bank

478
00:45:19,399 --> 00:45:21,196
Easy. You're giving me a woody

479
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:23,963
And one was wearing a big, green mask

480
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:26,732
For once, you're right

481
00:45:26,806 --> 00:45:29,104
Except it wasn't one of my boys

482
00:45:29,209 --> 00:45:32,838
Maybe if you tried a little actual police work...

483
00:45:32,946 --> 00:45:34,243
Cuff him

484
00:45:34,347 --> 00:45:37,942
We got a stiff upstairs. It's a guy from the heist

485
00:45:38,051 --> 00:45:40,849
Call that high-priced lawyer of yours

486
00:45:40,954 --> 00:45:43,184
We'll go downtown for a chat

487
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:45,155
Get him out of here

488
00:46:05,312 --> 00:46:08,338
I know you're in there

489
00:46:11,284 --> 00:46:12,808
Police!

490
00:46:14,788 --> 00:46:16,119
Open up!

491
00:46:16,222 --> 00:46:18,918
Oh, my God

492
00:46:21,761 --> 00:46:25,094
I know you're in there!

493
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:32,896
Open up!

494
00:46:33,006 --> 00:46:36,908
Come on, I'm getting blisters on my fingers

495
00:46:41,114 --> 00:46:42,138
Stop it

496
00:46:43,249 --> 00:46:44,409
I'm coming, okay

497
00:46:44,517 --> 00:46:47,077
I'll be right there

498
00:46:51,224 --> 00:46:53,419
Let's go, move it!

499
00:46:53,493 --> 00:46:55,427
AIright!

500
00:47:01,234 --> 00:47:02,861
Hi, Lieutenant

501
00:47:02,969 --> 00:47:06,496
This isn't the best time right now. I just--

502
00:47:06,773 --> 00:47:08,707
Won't you come in?

503
00:47:11,444 --> 00:47:12,934
Where were you last night?

504
00:47:13,947 --> 00:47:15,471
Here, mostly

505
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:16,511
Something wrong?

506
00:47:16,783 --> 00:47:18,717
What do you know about The Mask?

507
00:47:18,818 --> 00:47:20,877
"Mask?"

508
00:47:20,987 --> 00:47:22,511
Don't insult my intelligence

509
00:47:22,789 --> 00:47:26,418
He robs the bank you work in, then I find this in the Coco Bongo

510
00:47:26,526 --> 00:47:29,154
There can't be 2 idiots with these pajamas

511
00:47:31,531 --> 00:47:33,829
May I see those pajamas?

512
00:47:36,136 --> 00:47:37,728
Those pajamas?

513
00:47:37,837 --> 00:47:40,738
Those pajamas...

514
00:47:41,975 --> 00:47:43,067
were stolen

515
00:47:43,176 --> 00:47:45,872
Somebody stole your pajamas?

516
00:47:51,151 --> 00:47:55,349
What is this city coming to...

517
00:47:55,455 --> 00:48:00,791
when a man's pajama drawer is no longer safe!

518
00:48:06,032 --> 00:48:07,465
Look at that guy

519
00:48:07,567 --> 00:48:10,832
- Nobody's that fast at my bank. - I'll say

520
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:16,065
That's one hell of a rubber mask

521
00:48:16,142 --> 00:48:17,370
Lab reports?

522
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:22,073
We got fingerprints from currency, but nothing matches Tyrel's men

523
00:48:22,182 --> 00:48:23,581
He beat them to the punch

524
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:28,514
Get the bank employee files and run down the prints on a guy named Ipkiss

525
00:48:28,588 --> 00:48:31,148
You figure it was an inside job?

526
00:48:31,224 --> 00:48:34,853
I need some prints to lock this whack job up till doomsday

527
00:48:37,297 --> 00:48:39,288
50 grand...

528
00:48:39,399 --> 00:48:44,063
to whoever finds that green bastard before the cops

529
00:48:44,137 --> 00:48:47,402
I want you to get the word out to every street hustler...

530
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:50,271
every low life in this town. Understand?

531
00:48:50,343 --> 00:48:53,437
I want him here tomorrow, alive

532
00:48:55,348 --> 00:48:56,815
You still here?

533
00:48:56,883 --> 00:48:58,817
Come on, let's go

534
00:49:03,923 --> 00:49:05,481
What are you looking at?

535
00:49:05,592 --> 00:49:06,616
You

536
00:49:06,893 --> 00:49:08,360
You're losing it

537
00:49:08,461 --> 00:49:12,227
I'm not losing anything...

538
00:49:12,332 --> 00:49:14,163
except maybe some extra baggage

539
00:49:14,267 --> 00:49:15,894
What's that mean?

540
00:49:18,171 --> 00:49:21,470
You didn't fight much last night when that freak kissed you

541
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:24,874
Did it look like I had much of a choice?

542
00:49:26,112 --> 00:49:27,579
Maybe you did...

543
00:49:30,083 --> 00:49:32,574
maybe you didn't. Who knows, right?

544
00:49:34,354 --> 00:49:35,548
I'll tell you one thing

545
00:49:36,956 --> 00:49:40,119
It's going to be payback for anybody who crosses me

546
00:49:50,603 --> 00:49:54,232
We have a crisis here and you stroll in an hour late?

547
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,274
If I must put up with--

548
00:49:56,376 --> 00:49:59,174
Back off, monkey boy...

549
00:49:59,279 --> 00:50:02,976
or I'll tell your dad you treat this place like your piggy bank

550
00:50:03,082 --> 00:50:04,982
Or we should call the IRS...

551
00:50:05,051 --> 00:50:08,214
and arrange a vacation for you at CIub Fed?

552
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:12,890
That'll be all

553
00:50:16,729 --> 00:50:17,923
Genius

554
00:50:18,031 --> 00:50:21,694
That was genius. Buddy, I have chills

555
00:50:21,801 --> 00:50:25,669
God! What side of whose bed did you wake up on, man?

556
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:27,069
I'm not sure

557
00:50:28,141 --> 00:50:30,632
I haven't exactly been myself lately

558
00:50:30,743 --> 00:50:32,711
You don't look real fabulous

559
00:50:32,812 --> 00:50:34,780
Really, do I look bad?

560
00:50:36,015 --> 00:50:39,576
Don't worry. This'll put the color back in your cheeks

561
00:50:39,686 --> 00:50:43,918
2 tickets to the charity ball at the Coco Bongo CIub, Saturday

562
00:50:44,023 --> 00:50:46,548
Anybody who's anybody will be there

563
00:50:46,659 --> 00:50:48,524
Want to be my date?

564
00:50:54,934 --> 00:50:57,528
Wait just a minute

565
00:50:57,604 --> 00:51:00,869
- Why are you here? - I wanted to thank you

566
00:51:02,041 --> 00:51:04,908
I don't have much to open an account with anymore

567
00:51:05,011 --> 00:51:08,242
What about the cIub? You were doing great

568
00:51:08,514 --> 00:51:11,176
It's not your problem. I'll be okay

569
00:51:11,284 --> 00:51:13,013
Come here

570
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:21,189
You didn't stop by just to see me, did you?

571
00:51:23,596 --> 00:51:25,086
It's okay, tell me

572
00:51:27,867 --> 00:51:30,563
The guy they say robbed this place...

573
00:51:30,637 --> 00:51:33,504
- The Mask? - I think he was at the cIub

574
00:51:34,507 --> 00:51:35,804
Really?

575
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:38,503
They say he's pretty...

576
00:51:38,611 --> 00:51:39,669
weird looking

577
00:51:42,915 --> 00:51:44,473
Yeah, but...

578
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:46,848
you should see him dance

579
00:51:48,655 --> 00:51:52,022
Did anyone find out who he is?

580
00:51:52,125 --> 00:51:54,184
Why, you interested?

581
00:51:56,129 --> 00:51:58,188
Just curious, I guess

582
00:52:00,333 --> 00:52:03,860
I better be going

583
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:05,938
Thanks for everything

584
00:52:07,674 --> 00:52:09,141
You'd like to see him again?

585
00:52:15,248 --> 00:52:16,840
I wouldn't mind

586
00:52:16,949 --> 00:52:19,611
I know him, you know

587
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,209
You do?

588
00:52:21,321 --> 00:52:24,552
We're old college buddies, him and me

589
00:52:25,925 --> 00:52:29,190
It's funny you mention he dances because...

590
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:36,327
I taught him a couple of dance moves myself

591
00:52:36,602 --> 00:52:39,662
Think you could have him meet me tonight?

592
00:52:39,772 --> 00:52:41,831
Maybe I could work something out

593
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:44,843
- How about at Landfill Park? - Sunset

594
00:52:44,944 --> 00:52:46,809
- Perfect. - Super

595
00:52:48,114 --> 00:52:51,675
Thanks, Stanley. You really are a nice guy

596
00:52:58,624 --> 00:53:00,785
This is an interesting place

597
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:03,954
Looks like fourth- or fifth-century Scandinavian

598
00:53:04,063 --> 00:53:08,363
Possibly a representation of one of the Norse night gods, maybe Loki

599
00:53:11,237 --> 00:53:13,102
Loki?

600
00:53:13,206 --> 00:53:14,696
Who is Loki?

601
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:17,140
The Norse god of mischief

602
00:53:17,243 --> 00:53:22,180
Supposedly he caused such trouble that Odin banished him from Valhalla forever

603
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:26,980
Then he could have banished him into that mask

604
00:53:27,086 --> 00:53:30,112
I'm talking about mythology, Mr. Ipkiss

605
00:53:30,189 --> 00:53:32,123
This is a piece of wood

606
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,718
but your book...!

607
00:53:34,827 --> 00:53:38,228
My book is about masks as a metaphor

608
00:53:38,331 --> 00:53:41,357
A metaphor,not to be taken literally

609
00:53:41,634 --> 00:53:43,363
You suffer from a mild delusion

610
00:53:46,706 --> 00:53:48,037
AIright

611
00:53:51,444 --> 00:53:53,139
I'll prove it to you

612
00:53:54,347 --> 00:53:57,942
But I am not responsible for the consequences

613
00:53:58,017 --> 00:54:01,919
Just sit back and enjoy the ride, Mr. Expert

614
00:54:02,021 --> 00:54:04,990
You don't scare me. Go right ahead

615
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:08,259
See you

616
00:54:33,419 --> 00:54:37,913
You said Loki was a night god. Maybe it works at night

617
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:43,394
I should warn you that I don't work personally with really sick people

618
00:54:43,463 --> 00:54:46,921
There are private institutions for those things

619
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:50,992
I can arrange for a safe environment for you tonight, if you want

620
00:54:55,141 --> 00:54:56,938
I must see Tina

621
00:54:58,144 --> 00:54:59,839
But what can I do?

622
00:55:00,746 --> 00:55:02,805
Do I go as myself...

623
00:55:02,915 --> 00:55:04,348
or The Mask?

624
00:55:05,952 --> 00:55:10,048
If I tell you, you promise to leave my office right now?

625
00:55:16,762 --> 00:55:18,457
Go as yourself...

626
00:55:18,731 --> 00:55:20,892
and as The Mask

627
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,266
Because they are both one and the same beautiful person

628
00:55:26,939 --> 00:55:30,238
Got the cross-check on the fingerprints. It's Ipkiss

629
00:55:30,343 --> 00:55:31,708
I'm looking at him

630
00:55:31,811 --> 00:55:34,177
Keep the SWAT team standing by

631
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,977
If he's half as bad as they say, we'll have a fulI dance card

632
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:39,847
Pickle relish?

633
00:55:39,952 --> 00:55:42,853
- Get in the car. - But I ordered onion rings

634
00:55:47,126 --> 00:55:49,253
LANDFILL PARK

635
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:12,408
What are you doing here?

636
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:19,190
I wanted to make sure that you 2 got together all right

637
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:21,089
That's nice

638
00:56:21,193 --> 00:56:24,458
I hardly ever stop by here

639
00:56:24,564 --> 00:56:26,794
It's hard to believe it was...

640
00:56:26,899 --> 00:56:27,991
a garbage heap

641
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:35,240
It's really beautiful right around sunset

642
00:56:35,341 --> 00:56:39,300
The methane emissions really pick up the colors

643
00:56:39,412 --> 00:56:40,902
All those...

644
00:56:41,013 --> 00:56:43,447
pinks and greens

645
00:56:49,889 --> 00:56:53,017
My friend will be along here any minute. I better go

646
00:56:54,961 --> 00:56:56,588
Stanley, wait

647
00:57:03,035 --> 00:57:04,559
Hello, cherie

648
00:57:04,837 --> 00:57:06,862
We meet again!

649
00:57:06,973 --> 00:57:08,167
Is it fate?

650
00:57:08,274 --> 00:57:11,209
Is it meant to be? It is written in the stars...

651
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:13,835
that we are destined to fraternize?

652
00:57:13,913 --> 00:57:16,609
I'd like to think so

653
00:57:20,953 --> 00:57:25,447
Kiss me, my dear, and I will reveal my croissant

654
00:57:25,558 --> 00:57:30,359
I will spread your p t . I will dip my ladle in your vichyssoise

655
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:36,968
She's so coy

656
00:57:37,069 --> 00:57:39,037
I love it

657
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:48,502
Our love is like a red, red rose

658
00:57:48,581 --> 00:57:51,175
And I am a little thorny

659
00:57:51,283 --> 00:57:53,843
Je t'adore! Je t'adore!

660
00:57:53,953 --> 00:57:56,012
Shoot the window. I don't care!

661
00:57:58,024 --> 00:58:00,584
This is Kellaway. I need back-up

662
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:03,490
Cigarette?

663
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:18,002
Now, like Napoleon...

664
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:21,478
I will divide and conquer

665
00:58:22,448 --> 00:58:24,541
Police!

666
00:58:26,018 --> 00:58:26,916
Merde

667
00:58:27,019 --> 00:58:29,317
Freeze

668
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:34,058
Put your hands up

669
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,321
But you told me to freeze

670
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:39,557
AIright, alright, unfreeze

671
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:42,697
You're under arrest

672
00:58:42,935 --> 00:58:45,529
It wasn't me

673
00:58:45,604 --> 00:58:48,164
It was the one-armed man

674
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:50,700
AIright, I confess

675
00:58:50,943 --> 00:58:54,242
I did it, you hear? And I'm glad, glad, I tell you!

676
00:58:55,614 --> 00:59:00,017
What are they going to do to me, Sarge? What are they going to do?

677
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:03,316
Sorry, son, that's not my department

678
00:59:03,422 --> 00:59:04,548
Search him

679
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,292
Where's a camcorder when you need one?

680
00:59:15,434 --> 00:59:18,699
It's going to be a long night. My wife'll kill me

681
00:59:18,771 --> 00:59:22,434
- What is it? - Cops got Ipkiss at Landfill Park

682
00:59:22,541 --> 00:59:26,238
Let me cover it. I need this story. You go home to Claire

683
00:59:26,345 --> 00:59:28,438
I don't know. Ramsey said--

684
00:59:28,547 --> 00:59:30,708
I will take care of Ramsey

685
00:59:30,983 --> 00:59:32,541
Thanks a million, I owe you one

686
00:59:33,719 --> 00:59:36,244
Really big sunglasses, nerf ball...

687
00:59:36,355 --> 00:59:38,653
Bike horn...

688
00:59:38,724 --> 00:59:41,591
Small-mouthed bass... bowling pin...

689
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,354
mouse-trap...

690
00:59:45,431 --> 00:59:47,058
rubber chicken...

691
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:50,226
- Little to the left. That's it. - I don't know

692
00:59:50,302 --> 00:59:52,270
Funny eyeball glasses...

693
00:59:52,371 --> 00:59:54,601
I've never seen those in my life

694
00:59:54,673 --> 00:59:56,766
- bazooka. - I have a permit for that

695
00:59:58,077 --> 00:59:59,977
- Picture of Kellaway's wife... - What?

696
01:00:00,646 --> 01:00:02,170
CalL ME LOVER!

697
01:00:02,248 --> 01:00:04,273
Margaret! Son of a bitch!

698
01:00:04,383 --> 01:00:08,581
I figured you had a sense of humor

699
01:00:08,687 --> 01:00:09,984
you married her!

700
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:15,086
That's got to hurt

701
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:16,422
Get him!

702
01:00:40,085 --> 01:00:42,519
It's over. Raise your hands...

703
01:00:42,621 --> 01:00:44,612
or we'll fire

704
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:49,318
Hit it!

705
01:01:10,316 --> 01:01:14,275
They call me Cuban Pete I'm the king of the rumba beat

706
01:01:14,386 --> 01:01:15,819
When I play the maracas

707
01:01:16,088 --> 01:01:17,680
I go chick-chicky boom

708
01:01:19,091 --> 01:01:20,456
Yes, I'm Cuban Pete

709
01:01:20,526 --> 01:01:22,721
I'm the craze of my street

710
01:01:22,828 --> 01:01:27,060
When I start to dance everything goes Chick-chicky boom, chick-chicky boom

711
01:01:27,166 --> 01:01:29,225
The seoritas sing...

712
01:01:29,335 --> 01:01:31,530
and they swing

713
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:33,538
It's very nice

714
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:34,664
FulI of spice

715
01:01:35,741 --> 01:01:40,075
They dance and bring a happy ring Never a care

716
01:01:40,145 --> 01:01:44,081
Singing a song All the day long

717
01:01:46,685 --> 01:01:50,416
If you like the beat Take a lesson from Cuban Pete

718
01:01:50,522 --> 01:01:52,683
I'll teach you to chick-chicky boom

719
01:01:54,827 --> 01:01:56,795
He's a modest guy

720
01:01:56,896 --> 01:01:59,262
AIthough he's the hottest guy

721
01:01:59,365 --> 01:02:03,233
In Havana

722
01:02:03,335 --> 01:02:05,360
Si, senorita, I know...

723
01:02:05,437 --> 01:02:07,871
that when I chicky boom

724
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:11,337
It's very nice so fulI of spice

725
01:02:11,443 --> 01:02:13,536
I place my hand on your hip

726
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:16,342
And if you will give me your hand

727
01:02:16,448 --> 01:02:20,384
Then we shall try Just you and I

728
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:24,350
- Not bad. - Shut up and help me down

729
01:02:24,456 --> 01:02:28,153
I'll teach you to chick-chicky boom Chick-chicky boom

730
01:02:49,782 --> 01:02:52,182
Dance and I'll blow your brains out

731
01:02:56,588 --> 01:02:57,816
Give me that thing

732
01:02:59,458 --> 01:03:00,516
See you!

733
01:03:00,626 --> 01:03:04,756
There! Let's get him. Snap out of it. This dance is over!

734
01:03:04,863 --> 01:03:07,354
Let's go! Follow me, officers!

735
01:03:12,871 --> 01:03:16,898
He's down the alley. Follow me. Come on. Grab your gun

736
01:03:38,063 --> 01:03:39,530
Stanley, get in!

737
01:03:40,966 --> 01:03:41,990
There!

738
01:03:44,136 --> 01:03:46,229
Halt, or I'll shoot!

739
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,366
Shoot! Shoot!

740
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:53,102
Seat belts

741
01:03:57,316 --> 01:03:58,442
I missed him

742
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:02,315
Come on, we all missed him

743
01:04:05,391 --> 01:04:08,292
THE MASK ROBS BANK

744
01:04:08,394 --> 01:04:10,157
I saw it

745
01:04:11,096 --> 01:04:12,893
I saw everything

746
01:04:13,899 --> 01:04:16,163
What's happening to you, Stanley?

747
01:04:18,537 --> 01:04:20,471
It's crazy

748
01:04:24,943 --> 01:04:27,639
I'm losing control

749
01:04:27,913 --> 01:04:29,938
When I put that mask on...

750
01:04:30,049 --> 01:04:32,040
I can do anything

751
01:04:32,151 --> 01:04:35,052
Be anything

752
01:04:38,157 --> 01:04:40,318
It's wrecking my life

753
01:04:40,426 --> 01:04:44,419
My life is wrecked. Wrecked

754
01:04:46,065 --> 01:04:49,057
I don't know what's happening to you...

755
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:52,869
but I do know this:

756
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:57,307
that letter you sent my column...

757
01:04:57,409 --> 01:05:00,344
that was from a guy with more guts...

758
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:03,245
and more heart...

759
01:05:03,315 --> 01:05:06,580
than any of the creeps I've met in this city

760
01:05:06,685 --> 01:05:09,882
Whatever that mask is...

761
01:05:09,988 --> 01:05:11,250
you don't need it

762
01:05:12,157 --> 01:05:13,488
You...

763
01:05:14,393 --> 01:05:16,657
Stanley Ipkiss...

764
01:05:16,929 --> 01:05:20,126
are already all you'll ever need to be

765
01:05:24,403 --> 01:05:26,462
Gosh, Peg...

766
01:05:28,273 --> 01:05:30,036
do you really mean that?

767
01:05:31,443 --> 01:05:33,604
Actually...

768
01:05:33,712 --> 01:05:34,906
no

769
01:05:35,013 --> 01:05:36,446
What?

770
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:41,486
Where were you? I've been vamping for 20 minutes

771
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:43,488
Is this him?

772
01:05:43,555 --> 01:05:45,489
You got the 50 thou'?

773
01:05:46,558 --> 01:05:48,549
Give her the money

774
01:05:51,763 --> 01:05:53,196
Right

775
01:05:53,265 --> 01:05:55,995
With the mask on, he turns into that green thing

776
01:05:59,104 --> 01:06:00,731
What are you doing?

777
01:06:01,006 --> 01:06:06,137
Sorry. You really are a great guy, I just can't lose my condo

778
01:06:06,245 --> 01:06:09,271
It's so hard to find an apartment in this city

779
01:06:14,219 --> 01:06:15,709
You said you wouldn't hurt him!

780
01:06:19,024 --> 01:06:20,116
I lied

781
01:06:39,144 --> 01:06:40,736
Tell me

782
01:06:40,846 --> 01:06:42,177
How's this mask work?

783
01:06:42,281 --> 01:06:45,114
I don't know. You just...

784
01:06:46,251 --> 01:06:47,309
put it on

785
01:07:00,199 --> 01:07:01,359
Boss...

786
01:07:02,301 --> 01:07:03,928
be careful, huh?

787
01:07:23,922 --> 01:07:25,981
What a rush

788
01:07:27,326 --> 01:07:31,194
You okay?

789
01:07:32,264 --> 01:07:34,232
I'm better than ever, you idiot

790
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:38,630
What do we do with Ipkiss?

791
01:07:40,939 --> 01:07:42,873
The police want the mask

792
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:45,944
We'll give them The Mask

793
01:07:56,088 --> 01:07:58,386
The money better be here...

794
01:07:58,457 --> 01:08:01,085
or you can Ip-kiss your ass good-bye

795
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:49,498
Get over there

796
01:09:01,486 --> 01:09:04,717
Can't believe it. Hardened cops dancing in the street...

797
01:09:04,823 --> 01:09:07,189
and broadcast on the 11 o'clock news

798
01:09:07,292 --> 01:09:10,090
- The SWAT team was offered Vegas. - I'm history

799
01:09:10,195 --> 01:09:14,154
The Captain'll have my badge for breakfast with a pension on top

800
01:09:14,266 --> 01:09:17,895
It's not all your fault. Something will turn up

801
01:09:18,003 --> 01:09:21,530
Sure, Ipkiss will fall right into my lap

802
01:09:28,347 --> 01:09:30,281
Get him off of me!

803
01:09:35,354 --> 01:09:36,514
Wait!

804
01:09:36,788 --> 01:09:38,380
I can explain everything

805
01:09:38,490 --> 01:09:42,290
You can explain everything? Explain this!

806
01:09:43,528 --> 01:09:46,929
Get him up! Let's go! I got a cell for you, pal

807
01:10:10,555 --> 01:10:12,045
Forget about me, buddy

808
01:10:12,157 --> 01:10:14,352
Find a new place to live

809
01:10:16,928 --> 01:10:19,226
I'll be in here for a long, long time

810
01:10:32,511 --> 01:10:34,342
You, with the face

811
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:37,007
You got a visitor

812
01:10:46,191 --> 01:10:48,819
- Why? - Is it true?

813
01:10:50,629 --> 01:10:52,119
You're The Mask

814
01:10:52,230 --> 01:10:55,358
Yeah, but don't tell anybody. If I get...

815
01:10:55,467 --> 01:10:58,436
a good lawyer and a deal...

816
01:10:58,537 --> 01:11:00,835
I'll be out in about 10,000 years

817
01:11:00,939 --> 01:11:03,100
It's risky, coming here

818
01:11:03,208 --> 01:11:05,608
Your boyfriend might be upset

819
01:11:07,312 --> 01:11:11,373
He'll be at the charity ball tonight

820
01:11:11,483 --> 01:11:13,883
Like what? The Lambada?

821
01:11:13,952 --> 01:11:18,048
This is serious. There must be a way to stop him

822
01:11:18,156 --> 01:11:20,215
How does it work?

823
01:11:21,126 --> 01:11:22,423
I don't know

824
01:11:23,328 --> 01:11:25,922
It's like...

825
01:11:25,997 --> 01:11:29,330
it brings your innermost desires to life

826
01:11:29,401 --> 01:11:31,631
If deep down inside...

827
01:11:33,138 --> 01:11:36,164
you're a bit repressed and hopelessly romantic...

828
01:11:36,241 --> 01:11:38,300
you become some sort of...

829
01:11:38,410 --> 01:11:41,106
a love-crazy wild man

830
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:43,181
And if you're like Dorian?

831
01:11:43,281 --> 01:11:46,079
Then we're all in big trouble

832
01:11:46,184 --> 01:11:49,119
And if I were you, I'd get out of town. Fast

833
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:52,884
Thanks

834
01:11:53,859 --> 01:11:54,917
For what?

835
01:11:55,026 --> 01:11:57,221
Lots of things

836
01:12:00,999 --> 01:12:03,593
Sharing a sunset with me

837
01:12:03,668 --> 01:12:08,833
For being the only guy who treated me like a person, not...

838
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:09,998
a party favor

839
01:12:13,545 --> 01:12:16,139
For being any kind of romantic...

840
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:18,045
even a hopeless one

841
01:12:23,955 --> 01:12:25,684
You're welcome

842
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:28,281
That night at the cIub I knew...

843
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:31,324
I'd found someone special

844
01:12:34,032 --> 01:12:36,796
The Mask

845
01:12:36,868 --> 01:12:39,803
It was the guy inside The Mask

846
01:12:39,905 --> 01:12:43,341
It was you all along

847
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,542
Lady, time's up

848
01:12:51,650 --> 01:12:53,584
Could I have just...

849
01:12:53,652 --> 01:12:55,552
one more minute?

850
01:12:57,355 --> 01:12:59,789
I've got to disappear for a while now

851
01:12:59,891 --> 01:13:03,588
Don't know where but I'll let you know as soon as I can

852
01:13:48,073 --> 01:13:50,200
Somebody help me!

853
01:13:55,113 --> 01:13:56,774
Guard, guard!

854
01:13:56,881 --> 01:14:00,078
A woman's being chased in the alley

855
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:02,085
She needs help

856
01:14:02,187 --> 01:14:04,917
Sure. Keep it down

857
01:14:05,023 --> 01:14:07,753
Serve and protect, man!

858
01:14:28,213 --> 01:14:30,681
Good boy. Come on

859
01:14:32,817 --> 01:14:34,944
Jump up. Can you jump up?

860
01:14:36,721 --> 01:14:39,656
Remember how I taught you not to jump up on people? Forget that

861
01:14:39,758 --> 01:14:41,726
Come on! Get up here

862
01:14:43,962 --> 01:14:45,827
Get up. Get up here!

863
01:14:46,798 --> 01:14:49,232
Get up. Get up here. That's it

864
01:14:49,334 --> 01:14:51,825
You can do it. Come on. Come on!

865
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,998
Put some effort into it!

866
01:15:14,092 --> 01:15:16,458
Baby, there you are

867
01:15:16,528 --> 01:15:18,393
I was worried about you

868
01:15:18,496 --> 01:15:22,489
- You talk to the cops? - Only to see what Ipkiss told them

869
01:15:22,767 --> 01:15:26,794
That's right, you and Stanley. You two are getting awfully close

870
01:15:27,906 --> 01:15:29,931
Bet you helped him with the bank job

871
01:15:30,041 --> 01:15:32,839
- That's ridiculous. - Oh, is it?

872
01:15:34,145 --> 01:15:36,511
Look what I found in her car

873
01:15:38,416 --> 01:15:39,781
Going away alone, baby?

874
01:15:44,022 --> 01:15:46,081
Boys, I want you to...

875
01:15:46,191 --> 01:15:48,716
get her something pretty to wear

876
01:15:51,029 --> 01:15:53,827
We're going to a party tonight

877
01:15:53,898 --> 01:15:56,492
We'll have one hell of a time, right?

878
01:15:58,136 --> 01:15:59,535
Get out of my sight

879
01:16:00,939 --> 01:16:02,236
Jump up

880
01:16:02,307 --> 01:16:03,467
Get up. Come on

881
01:16:05,443 --> 01:16:08,241
Come on, Milo. Jump, please

882
01:16:08,346 --> 01:16:10,439
Do it for Daddy

883
01:16:14,285 --> 01:16:16,116
That's it!

884
01:16:17,455 --> 01:16:20,151
God, I can't believe it

885
01:16:21,559 --> 01:16:24,289
Good boy. Good boy

886
01:16:27,999 --> 01:16:29,296
See that man over there?

887
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,027
He's got keys

888
01:16:32,871 --> 01:16:34,532
Go get those keys

889
01:16:34,806 --> 01:16:37,274
Go get them. Go get the keys

890
01:16:39,811 --> 01:16:40,778
That's it

891
01:16:42,147 --> 01:16:43,114
The key

892
01:16:49,087 --> 01:16:51,248
No, not the cheese, the keys

893
01:16:53,525 --> 01:16:55,425
Drop the cheese...

894
01:16:56,961 --> 01:16:58,360
and get the keys

895
01:16:58,429 --> 01:17:01,057
Over there, over there

896
01:17:17,782 --> 01:17:20,080
Oh, man. Come on

897
01:17:20,285 --> 01:17:24,244
Come here. Good boy. That's a good boy

898
01:17:24,455 --> 01:17:27,913
Give it, give me the keys. Give me the keys

899
01:17:28,092 --> 01:17:30,583
Come on, drop it, drop it

900
01:17:30,862 --> 01:17:32,921
It's sundown

901
01:17:33,031 --> 01:17:34,862
It's almost time

902
01:17:36,534 --> 01:17:38,434
I wouldn't, darling

903
01:17:40,271 --> 01:17:41,431
DANGER EXPLOSIVES

904
01:17:41,539 --> 01:17:44,440
Wouldn't want to start the celebration early

905
01:18:28,953 --> 01:18:29,977
Hold it!

906
01:18:30,088 --> 01:18:31,885
I am warning you...

907
01:18:31,956 --> 01:18:34,117
I am seriously stressed out here

908
01:18:34,225 --> 01:18:35,522
Easy

909
01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:37,527
Come on

910
01:18:37,629 --> 01:18:38,857
Don't be an idiot

911
01:18:38,963 --> 01:18:43,593
You're in a police station. There is no way you'll walk out of here like this

912
01:18:45,069 --> 01:18:46,730
You're know, you're right

913
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:52,173
- Absolutely right. - What are you doing?

914
01:18:53,611 --> 01:18:55,101
You'll take me out...

915
01:18:55,213 --> 01:18:56,976
as your prisoner

916
01:18:57,081 --> 01:18:59,811
Put it on! Put it on!

917
01:19:01,319 --> 01:19:02,684
Come on

918
01:19:02,787 --> 01:19:05,517
- I'm really very sorry about this. - I'm sure

919
01:19:08,593 --> 01:19:10,185
You got the wrong guy

920
01:19:10,295 --> 01:19:11,785
It's a bum rap

921
01:19:11,863 --> 01:19:13,592
I got my rights

922
01:19:13,698 --> 01:19:15,632
Where are you taking Ipkiss?

923
01:19:15,733 --> 01:19:18,725
Ixnay! Ehay's otgay an ungay

924
01:19:18,836 --> 01:19:22,169
I get it. Pig Latin, right?

925
01:19:22,273 --> 01:19:24,207
Eesay ouyay aterlay

926
01:19:25,743 --> 01:19:26,835
Come on!

927
01:19:34,652 --> 01:19:37,086
Sit back and relax

928
01:19:39,624 --> 01:19:41,990
I must change for the party

929
01:19:52,103 --> 01:19:54,571
TONIGHT, CASINO

930
01:19:57,675 --> 01:20:00,166
WAR ORPHANS FUND

931
01:20:14,058 --> 01:20:15,025
I need cigarettes

932
01:20:15,093 --> 01:20:17,357
- Which brand? - It doesn't matter, I don't smoke

933
01:20:17,428 --> 01:20:20,226
But for you, I would shoot the Surgeon General

934
01:20:21,766 --> 01:20:23,700
Mayor Tilton, may we have a word?

935
01:20:23,801 --> 01:20:28,067
I always have time for the press and my loyal constituents

936
01:21:04,242 --> 01:21:06,972
Let me out of these cuffs, you drive like a maniac

937
01:21:07,045 --> 01:21:09,343
Sorry, we're late for the ball

938
01:21:09,447 --> 01:21:12,143
Alice and the rabbit'll be disappointed

939
01:21:12,216 --> 01:21:13,877
Now you're being cynical

940
01:21:16,888 --> 01:21:17,912
Who are you?

941
01:21:18,022 --> 01:21:21,014
I'm just an ex-employee...

942
01:21:21,125 --> 01:21:23,719
who's come for his back pay

943
01:21:23,795 --> 01:21:26,093
Or should I say payback?

944
01:21:29,934 --> 01:21:31,265
Kill him

945
01:21:50,455 --> 01:21:51,854
Come on

946
01:22:13,945 --> 01:22:15,242
Ladies and gentlemen...

947
01:22:15,346 --> 01:22:17,371
I will be the host...

948
01:22:17,482 --> 01:22:19,473
for the rest of the evening

949
01:22:30,294 --> 01:22:32,728
Get your dog away from me

950
01:22:34,065 --> 01:22:36,090
Sorry, he seems to be attracted to you

951
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:39,226
Where's everyone? Something's not kosher

952
01:22:39,337 --> 01:22:40,497
- Exactly. - Watch it!

953
01:22:40,771 --> 01:22:41,897
Sorry

954
01:22:42,006 --> 01:22:43,371
I must lock you in

955
01:22:44,942 --> 01:22:47,103
Use the radio

956
01:22:47,211 --> 01:22:50,442
You know, call for back-up or something

957
01:22:52,884 --> 01:22:56,376
This could be dangerous. Stay here and be a good boy

958
01:22:57,522 --> 01:23:00,286
Daddy has to go kick some ass

959
01:23:05,062 --> 01:23:06,427
He's a dead man

960
01:23:06,531 --> 01:23:09,364
Down! Get down!

961
01:23:10,434 --> 01:23:13,232
Take it easy, I got the point

962
01:23:24,982 --> 01:23:25,880
Blow it!

963
01:23:33,991 --> 01:23:35,982
Bastard

964
01:23:36,093 --> 01:23:37,583
What's the matter, darling?

965
01:23:37,862 --> 01:23:39,887
This is your big production number

966
01:23:39,997 --> 01:23:42,261
And you know it's important...

967
01:23:42,366 --> 01:23:44,800
to go out with a big bang

968
01:23:54,111 --> 01:23:55,476
Why are you here?

969
01:23:55,546 --> 01:23:59,107
Take this gun and start sneaking people out the back

970
01:24:03,187 --> 01:24:04,381
Step back

971
01:24:04,488 --> 01:24:07,946
- Do you know who I am? - A dead man if you don't step back

972
01:24:08,059 --> 01:24:09,959
What about some respect?

973
01:24:10,061 --> 01:24:12,859
- What kind of thug are you? - All set, Dorian

974
01:24:14,865 --> 01:24:16,492
That's it

975
01:24:17,969 --> 01:24:19,937
This party's over...

976
01:24:20,037 --> 01:24:21,937
in 10 minutes

977
01:24:23,874 --> 01:24:25,967
This is the moment when a man...

978
01:24:26,077 --> 01:24:28,272
shows what he's really made of

979
01:24:29,614 --> 01:24:30,546
Crap

980
01:24:30,648 --> 01:24:32,445
Drop it

981
01:24:45,062 --> 01:24:46,529
Smart dog

982
01:24:53,004 --> 01:24:56,462
Boss, look who decided to crash the party

983
01:24:56,574 --> 01:24:58,940
How's it going?

984
01:24:59,043 --> 01:25:00,874
Bring him up here!

985
01:25:02,013 --> 01:25:04,208
Wait! No!

986
01:25:04,315 --> 01:25:07,944
This is no time for last requests

987
01:25:08,052 --> 01:25:10,452
But all I wanted was a kiss

988
01:25:10,554 --> 01:25:12,954
A kiss?

989
01:25:13,057 --> 01:25:14,991
Just one...

990
01:25:15,092 --> 01:25:17,083
last kiss

991
01:25:17,194 --> 01:25:19,059
I can't shut it off

992
01:25:20,264 --> 01:25:22,698
There's always time...

993
01:25:24,335 --> 01:25:26,701
for one last kiss

994
01:25:31,709 --> 01:25:34,007
From the real Dorian

995
01:25:35,212 --> 01:25:37,544
The one I used to love

996
01:25:38,649 --> 01:25:40,674
Nobody ever kissed me like Dorian Tyrel

997
01:25:41,819 --> 01:25:42,751
Romeo!

998
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:44,879
This place will blow!

999
01:25:44,955 --> 01:25:47,150
Just wait!

1000
01:25:51,762 --> 01:25:53,696
I've decided...

1001
01:26:02,073 --> 01:26:04,337
to give her one last thrill

1002
01:26:15,252 --> 01:26:16,776
Get it!

1003
01:26:33,904 --> 01:26:35,337
Run, Milo!

1004
01:26:38,976 --> 01:26:41,570
Stanley, hurry!

1005
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:43,146
Don't worry

1006
01:26:43,247 --> 01:26:45,044
It's all over now

1007
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:56,992
Got you

1008
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:11,207
I'll take you apart

1009
01:27:11,308 --> 01:27:15,642
I hope you can enjoy the victory with one freaking eye!

1010
01:27:33,431 --> 01:27:35,160
Good doggie

1011
01:27:35,266 --> 01:27:36,198
Good doggie

1012
01:27:56,053 --> 01:27:56,985
I'm winning!

1013
01:28:21,078 --> 01:28:22,136
JACKPOT

1014
01:28:35,459 --> 01:28:37,427
Oh, my God!

1015
01:28:37,528 --> 01:28:39,792
This must be a new breed

1016
01:28:39,897 --> 01:28:41,262
Easy, boy!

1017
01:28:45,236 --> 01:28:46,225
Good boy!

1018
01:29:17,234 --> 01:29:19,031
Did you miss me?

1019
01:29:26,844 --> 01:29:27,868
I guess not!

1020
01:29:35,052 --> 01:29:38,317
Now, you have to ask yourself one question:

1021
01:29:38,389 --> 01:29:40,983
"Do I feel Iucky?"

1022
01:29:41,091 --> 01:29:42,023
Well...

1023
01:29:44,862 --> 01:29:46,329
do you...

1024
01:29:46,430 --> 01:29:48,125
punks?

1025
01:30:22,433 --> 01:30:25,800
That's a spicy meatball

1026
01:30:33,577 --> 01:30:35,067
How do?

1027
01:30:41,485 --> 01:30:44,045
This guy's incorrigible

1028
01:31:12,082 --> 01:31:14,175
You were good, kid, real good...

1029
01:31:14,284 --> 01:31:17,913
but as long as I'm around you'll be second-best

1030
01:31:38,642 --> 01:31:40,667
Police! Hands up!

1031
01:31:42,146 --> 01:31:44,546
Officers, arrest those men

1032
01:31:44,648 --> 01:31:47,276
I've always wanted to say that

1033
01:31:50,354 --> 01:31:51,412
Come on

1034
01:31:52,556 --> 01:31:53,818
Give me that gun

1035
01:31:59,697 --> 01:32:02,757
He stole all our jewelry. Take me to headquarters...

1036
01:32:02,866 --> 01:32:04,834
Stop that man!

1037
01:32:07,871 --> 01:32:09,133
I've got you now

1038
01:32:09,206 --> 01:32:11,265
Watch it, Chunky!

1039
01:32:11,542 --> 01:32:14,306
- Mayor Tilton, I'm so-- - What's wrong with you?

1040
01:32:14,578 --> 01:32:16,136
That man is The Mask

1041
01:32:16,246 --> 01:32:20,239
No. Dorian Tyrel was The Mask. I saw it with my own eyes

1042
01:32:20,350 --> 01:32:22,580
This man here saved our lives

1043
01:32:22,686 --> 01:32:25,712
- With a little help. - You're a real hero

1044
01:32:26,623 --> 01:32:28,215
It's nothing...

1045
01:32:28,325 --> 01:32:30,293
any American with...

1046
01:32:30,561 --> 01:32:33,758
balls of steel wouldn't do for his community

1047
01:32:33,831 --> 01:32:35,924
Come on

1048
01:32:38,202 --> 01:32:40,295
Mayor Tilton, did you see that dog?

1049
01:32:40,370 --> 01:32:43,271
Leave the dog alone

1050
01:32:43,373 --> 01:32:46,069
I want you in my office first thing tomorrow

1051
01:32:46,176 --> 01:32:49,236
- Yes, Your Honor. - That doesn't sound good at all

1052
01:32:49,346 --> 01:32:52,941
No, it doesn't. What would sound good to you?

1053
01:32:53,050 --> 01:32:55,245
- Breakfast. - Shut up!

1054
01:33:14,872 --> 01:33:16,840
Sure you know what you're doing?

1055
01:33:19,209 --> 01:33:21,074
I'm sure

1056
01:33:21,178 --> 01:33:23,146
Then do what you must

1057
01:33:36,393 --> 01:33:38,657
Sure you won't miss this guy?

1058
01:33:38,762 --> 01:33:42,027
When he's gone, all that's left is me

1059
01:34:26,476 --> 01:34:28,637
Smoking!
