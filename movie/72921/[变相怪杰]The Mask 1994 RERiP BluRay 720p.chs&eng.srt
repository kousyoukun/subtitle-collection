1
00:00:41,391 --> 00:00:44,326
(边城)
"Edge City"

2
00:00:47,997 --> 00:00:49,726
我要再放一根下去
Another one coming down

3
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,092
先等一下
Hang on

4
00:01:37,213 --> 00:01:41,013
摩登大圣
THE MASK

5
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:55,097
我弄到了...
I got those...

6
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:56,325
你要的音乐会票
concert tickets you wanted

7
00:01:56,432 --> 00:01:57,763
真的呀？
You're kidding!

8
00:01:57,834 --> 00:01:59,631
是周五晚的？
For Friday night?

9
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:02,603
太棒了，史丹利
Stanley, this is great

10
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,337
我几点去接你？
What time do I pick you up?

11
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:07,341
有个小状况
Here's the thing

12
00:02:07,443 --> 00:02:11,174
我的好友来了
她想去得要命
My best girlfriend is here
and she'd die to go to this...

13
00:02:11,247 --> 00:02:14,045
能不能帮她弄一张？
so could we get an extra ticket
for her?

14
00:02:15,618 --> 00:02:19,384
票卖光了，  买不到了
They're sold out. That means
there's no more

15
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,589
但我不能把她丢在家里
I can't let her sit home all alone

16
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,628
我看这样吧
I'll tell you what

17
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,254
你跟她去听
Go with your friend

18
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,726
这怎么行呢
I couldn't do that

19
00:02:32,836 --> 00:02:34,303
没关系啦
No, come on

20
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:37,833
史丹利，你真是盖世
Stanley, you are the nicest guy

21
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,133
真的，史丹利
Really, you are

22
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:44,043
查理，你说对不对？
顶尖好人
- Isn't he the nicest guy?
- The best

23
00:02:47,884 --> 00:02:50,682
她的脸皮比牛皮还厚
That was the most sickening display

24
00:02:50,787 --> 00:02:54,348
恶心透顶
我不同意
- I've ever seen.
- I disagree

25
00:02:54,457 --> 00:02:56,084
我跟她慢慢磨
I'm wearing her down

26
00:02:56,192 --> 00:02:59,423
老兄，你该换换口味了
Buddy, you need a little
change of pace

27
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:02,430
今晚我带你去猎艳
Tonight, I'll take you
on a love safari

28
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:05,865
深入都市丛林最黑暗之心
Deep into the darkest heart
of the urban jungle

29
00:03:06,135 --> 00:03:08,103
说来听听，酋长
Tell me more, bwana

30
00:03:08,204 --> 00:03:11,867
椰鼓夜总会
全城最红的新场子
The Coco Bongo CIub.
Hottest new joint in town

31
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,508
只有摩登凯子才准入场
Only the cr me de la cr me
need apply

32
00:03:15,812 --> 00:03:17,780
我们算老几？
你别漏气了
- How do we get in?
- Are you kidding?

33
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:20,281
交给我，你就安啦
Leave it to me.
Trust me, buddy

34
00:03:20,383 --> 00:03:22,544
我们要红遍全城
This will be the perfect...

35
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:24,882
就在今夜
night on the town

36
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:39,626
且慢
Hold the phone

37
00:03:39,736 --> 00:03:42,830
绝色美女在三点钟方向
Killer at three o'clock

38
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,928
你留守后方好好观察
Stand back and observe

39
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,539
请问在哪办开户？
Where do I open an account?

40
00:04:19,642 --> 00:04:21,405
新开户就在这里
New accounts,right here

41
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,877
你真幸运，我正要出差
You're Iucky, I was on my way out--

42
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,641
帮我拿一下
Hold this for me, please?

43
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:27,876
要我拿一辈子都行
I'll hold anything you want

44
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,420
你帮我办，好吗？
Can you help me?

45
00:04:57,814 --> 00:04:59,304
那么？
So...

46
00:05:00,283 --> 00:05:02,547
你想开哪种户头？
what kind of account do you want?

47
00:05:02,618 --> 00:05:06,850
我也不确定
我对理财最外行
Well, I'm not sure exactly. I'm
just terrible with things like that

48
00:05:07,857 --> 00:05:10,325
你的领带帅毙了
That's an interesting tie, Mister...

49
00:05:10,426 --> 00:05:12,724
在下史丹利伊卜吉
Ipkiss, Stanley Ipkiss

50
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:14,421
幸会，我叫婷娜
Tina Carlyle, it's a pleasure

51
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,293
荣幸之至
Pleasure's all mine

52
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:18,265
可以用吗？
May I?

53
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:19,631
用什么？
What?

54
00:05:19,702 --> 00:05:21,567
我像落汤鸡
I'm such a mess

55
00:05:22,438 --> 00:05:24,303
请用
Oh, of course

56
00:05:25,675 --> 00:05:27,575
本来就是给人用的
That's what they're there for

57
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,839
见到你的领带
As I was saying, that tie...

58
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:36,885
使我想起那种心理测验
“墨渍测验”
reminds me of those,
what do you call it, ink blot tests

59
00:05:36,986 --> 00:05:39,921
罗夏发明的
对
- A Rorschach test.
- Right

60
00:05:39,989 --> 00:05:42,287
它看起来像...
It sort of looks like...

61
00:05:43,493 --> 00:05:45,222
骑无鞍马的妙龄女
a young woman riding bareback

62
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:47,296
例如那
Sort of...

63
00:05:47,397 --> 00:05:48,796
裸体的伯爵夫人
Lady Godiva or something

64
00:05:50,366 --> 00:05:51,765
是的
Of course

65
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:55,360
你自己觉得呢？
What do you see, Mr. Ipkiss?

66
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,370
我不知道
I don't know

67
00:06:11,654 --> 00:06:13,417
颜色很亮丽
Bright colors...

68
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:14,922
带给人权力感
It's a power tie

69
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:16,821
使人感觉...
Supposed to make you feel...

70
00:06:16,926 --> 00:06:18,951
更够力
powerful

71
00:06:19,062 --> 00:06:20,529
你够力吗？
Does it work?

72
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:28,764
好了，关于开户的事
Now, how about that account?

73
00:06:28,871 --> 00:06:29,963
我们有
We have...

74
00:06:30,073 --> 00:06:32,268
好几种户头
several different plans

75
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,603
活期
Savings

76
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:39,279
支票
Checking

77
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:40,815
活期加支票
Savings and checking

78
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:43,078
活期加定存
Savings and CD's

79
00:06:43,352 --> 00:06:44,580
支票加定存
Checking and CD's

80
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:47,554
活期加支票、定存
国库券
Savings, checking and CD's.
T-Bills

81
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,524
或干脆把钱挖洞藏起来
Or we can throw your money
in a big mattress

82
00:06:55,965 --> 00:06:58,661
你填一些表格吧
Now, I have some forms
for you to fill out

83
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:10,536
很好，再向右一点点
That's it, sweetheart.
Now just a little bit to the right

84
00:07:10,646 --> 00:07:12,546
你们小声一点
Keep it down back there

85
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,347
是的
We'll try

86
00:07:15,451 --> 00:07:18,545
你觉得如何？
格局还可以，但...
- What do you think?
- Layout's not bad. But...

87
00:07:18,654 --> 00:07:21,555
警报器非常棘手
the motion detectors are a pain

88
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:23,819
你搞得定吗？
But you can pulI this off, right?

89
00:07:23,926 --> 00:07:26,827
我办事，你放心
You talking to the Doctor

90
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:28,829
但我有个疑问
I do have one question

91
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:30,728
你说
Which is?

92
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,393
尼哥有什么意见？
What's Niko have to say about this?

93
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:34,902
没意见
Nothing

94
00:07:36,005 --> 00:07:38,838
他不搞抢银行
你多用些脑筋
- This isn't his grift.
- Get real, man

95
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:40,806
他什么都搞
Everything is his grift

96
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:45,075
你是他的，夜总会也是
他的势力遍及全城
He owns you, he owns this cIub,
he owns this whole stinking town

97
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:48,617
现在不同了
Things change

98
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:52,586
你惹他，只有死路一条
You mess with Niko, you end up
taking a dirt nap

99
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,422
不用脑筋的是他
He's the only one who's napping...

100
00:07:58,594 --> 00:08:01,085
我要狠狠将他唤醒
and I'm about to give him
a serious wake-up call

101
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:03,427
但我们需要钱
But we need cash...

102
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:05,728
所以先抢银行
so first we take the bank...

103
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:07,166
再做掉尼哥
then we take Niko...

104
00:08:07,436 --> 00:08:09,631
然后我们就自由了
and then, my friend,
school is out

105
00:08:10,806 --> 00:08:14,037
全城任我们放肆猖狂
And this whole city is our playground

106
00:08:20,116 --> 00:08:22,414
走路不长眼睛！
Bub, watch where you're going!

107
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:39,627
马上来
Hang on, hang on!

108
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,905
你急着去投胎呀
Don't get your panties in a twist

109
00:08:43,005 --> 00:08:45,132
这是什么歪哥？
What the hell is it?

110
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:47,505
我不知道
I don't know...

111
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,737
值七百元就对了
about seven hundred bucks, eh?

112
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:53,572
有何贵干，朋友？
Now, what can I do for you, bub?

113
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:55,617
我来领我的喜美
I'm here for the Civic

114
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:59,519
刹车鼓损坏
整组传动要换
The brake drums are shot
and you need a new transmission

115
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,146
什么？
What?!

116
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:03,418
我只是来换机油
All I wanted was an oil change

117
00:09:03,526 --> 00:09:07,622
我们及早发现问题
算你狗命够大
Lucky we caught these problems
before they caused serious trouble

118
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:11,599
签名，用力写
Sign right here, and press down hard

119
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,168
没写价钱
我们会写
- There's no price.
- There will be

120
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,838
我今晚要用车呀
I've no car.
I need a car tonight

121
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,441
把专车借给他
Bring around the loaner

122
00:09:23,512 --> 00:09:25,173
专车？
The loaner?

123
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:27,476
专车？
The loaner?

124
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,041
古董名车
It's a classic

125
00:10:09,892 --> 00:10:12,656
查理，我死党史丹利伊卜吉
Gals, meet my buddy Stanley Ipkiss

126
00:10:12,762 --> 00:10:16,061
银行巨子
Humungo in the banking business

127
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:18,258
黑白讲
咱们进去吧
- Not really.
- Let's get in this joint

128
00:10:20,803 --> 00:10:23,271
大块头，你好吗？
How you doing, buddy?

129
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,133
我是查理呀
你好
- It's Charlie!
- How you doing?

130
00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:28,836
近来可好？
好久不见
- How you doing, my friend?
- Long time no see

131
00:10:28,944 --> 00:10:31,572
真是幸会
Good to see you

132
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:33,273
娘儿们，走吧
Come on, gals

133
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,540
咱们里面见
See you on the inside

134
00:10:44,827 --> 00:10:46,818
这是误会
This is a mistake

135
00:10:49,865 --> 00:10:52,800
好大狗胆，竟敢跨越绳子
You crossed the rope.
Never cross the rope

136
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:55,962
我朋友在里面
扔出去
- My friends are inside.
- Lose him

137
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,801
这怎么可以
This isn't fair

138
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,067
小心，我有血友病
Watch it, I'm a bleeder

139
00:10:59,175 --> 00:11:02,303
放下来
否则别想赚我的钱
Put me down now, or I am
never coming back here

140
00:11:12,855 --> 00:11:14,789
衰到家了
Jeez

141
00:11:28,704 --> 00:11:30,797
伊卜吉先生
Mr. Ipkiss!

142
00:11:30,906 --> 00:11:32,601
嗨
Hi

143

你还好吗？
Are you okay?

144
00:11:35,644 --> 00:11:37,111
我？
Me?

145
00:11:37,213 --> 00:11:38,578
我好得很
I'm great.

146
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:39,579
好得不得了
Really good

147
00:11:39,648 --> 00:11:41,809
我从未这么开心过
I never felt better, really

148
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:43,908
我只是...
I'm just...

149
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:45,179
出来透透气
catching some air

150
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,152
先生，你的车
Your car, sir

151
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,657
这不是我的车
That's not my car

152
00:11:49,725 --> 00:11:51,192
是它没错
It matches the ticket

153
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:56,823
好吧
AIright...

154
00:11:56,932 --> 00:11:58,900
给我就开
I'll take it

155
00:12:00,102 --> 00:12:02,798
但我非常不满意！
But I am very angry!

156
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,864
你相信吗？
Believe this?

157
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:09,408
我开保时捷来的
You drive in in a Porsche...

158
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:54,714
先生
Hey, Mister!

159
00:13:57,987 --> 00:13:59,454
撑住呀
Hold on!

160
00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:02,650
我会心肺复苏术

161
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:41,661
喂！你！
Hey, you!

你在下面干什么？
What are you doing down there?

163
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:48,899
我正在找...
I'm just looking for...

164
00:14:50,372 --> 00:14:51,862

165
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:54,702

I got it

166
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:07,018
你知道现在几点了？
Do you have any idea what time it is?

167
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:08,851
我真的不知道
Actually, no

168
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,325
我新铺的地毯！
My new carpet!

169
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:17,058
伊卜吉，我要扣你的押金
Well ,this is coming right out
of your security deposit

170
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:19,295

172
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,407
没什么
Nothing

173
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,806
空心大老倌，没出息！
Well, that's what you are, Ipkiss,
a big nothing

174
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,917
你这冷血的母僵尸！
Aren't you due at the lab
to get your bolts tightened?

175
00:15:38,654 --> 00:15:40,747
我应该骂给她听见
I should have said that

176
00:15:48,063 --> 00:15:50,031
你好呀
Hey, you

177
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:51,963
麦乐
Milo!

178
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:55,696
不许乱跳
要遵守狗民生活须知
No jumping up allowed.
It's against doggie ordinance

179
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,122
你想干什么？
What do you want?

180
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,025
要我掷飞盘？
You want me to throw that?

181
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:25,760
我累毙了
I'm very tired

182
00:16:25,868 --> 00:16:28,632
我只丢一次
I'll throw it one time

183
00:16:28,704 --> 00:16:31,696
你咬着我怎么丢
I won't throw it with you
attached to it

184
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,935
好了吗？
You ready?

185
00:16:37,046 --> 00:16:38,638

Get it

186

188
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,784
好啦，平曼太太
AIright, Mrs. Peenman!

189
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:53,585
您说人人都戴着面具！
Dr. Neuman, you say that everybody
wears a mask?

190
00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:55,425
没错
That's correct

191
00:16:55,531 --> 00:16:58,466
戴面具是一种比喻
We all wear masks,
metaphorically speaking

192
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:01,536
我们压抑本我的深层欲望
We suppress the id,
our darkest desires...

193
00:17:01,637 --> 00:17:04,572
装出社会能接受的形象

谢谢您接受访问
Thank you for being here

196
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,043
你是怎么了？
What's the matter with you?

197
00:17:17,152 --> 00:17:18,414
怎么了？
What is it?

198
00:17:19,855 --> 00:17:21,686
你在找什么？
What are you looking for?

199
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,725

202
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:36,597
戴面具是一种比喻
We all wear masks,

203
00:17:44,947 --> 00:17:46,778
酷毙了！
Yeah, right

204
00:18:26,755 --> 00:18:28,484
我现在要出征
Smoking!

205

派对时间到了
It's party time

206
00:18:32,661 --> 00:18:34,094
派-对
P-A-R-T-Y

207
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,256
为什么？因为我想要
Why? Because I gotta

208
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:46,101

Snooze!

211
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:51,596
我成了路上的扁尸
Look, ma, I'm road kill!

212
00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:03,846
别挡路！
他想较量一下
- Get out of the road!
- I think he wants to communicate

213
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:06,715
(轻轻按我)
squeeze me gently

214
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:25,705
先生
Hey, mister...

215
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,741
现在几点？
you got the time?

216
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,437
大草包，我告诉你吧
As a matter of fact, I do, Cubbie!

217
00:20:34,516 --> 00:20:35,778
你瞧瞧
Look at that!

218
00:20:35,884 --> 00:20:40,116
你该把鼻子当喇叭按
Time to honk your nose and pulI
your underwear over your head

219
00:20:46,695 --> 00:20:48,322
上呀
Come on!

220
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,333
放马过来，别害羞
Step right up here, don't be shy!

221
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,532
皮衣混混
Nobody likes...

222
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:01,836
最惹人厌
a bashful leather head

223
00:21:01,944 --> 00:21:03,138
快呀！
Move it!

224

我第一个戏法
For my first trick...

225
00:21:06,581 --> 00:21:08,845
要献给你
I'll do something for you, son

226
00:21:11,987 --> 00:21:16,515
长颈鹿给你
一边凉快去，别烦我
We have a giraffe. There you go, son.
Now get out of here, you bother me

227
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,628
现在...
Now...

228
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,621

237
00:22:16,284 --> 00:22:18,411
狗熊都能变英雄

238
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:20,546
挑战犯罪，保护无辜
I'd fight crime,

243

接受彻底翻修吧

244
00:23:24,886 --> 00:23:26,854
这是一场梦

诡异
impossible

顺利破案
cracking the case

267
00:25:00,949 --> 00:25:03,440
天哪，迟到了
Oh, my God, I'm late!

268
00:25:04,653 --> 00:25:06,678

You're 50 minutes late.
That's like stealing

288
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:54,687
对不起，以后不敢了
我真是窝囊废
I'm sorry, Mr. Dickey. It'll never
happen again. I've been a jerk

289
00:26:54,796 --> 00:26:57,594
你如果少看些裸女
If you weren't busy oogling
girlie pictures...

290
00:26:57,666 --> 00:27:00,066
就能多办些公事
you might get some work done

291
00:27:00,168 --> 00:27:03,797
她可能成为史丹利的客户
Sir. She's a perspective
client of Stanley's

292
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,370
真的吗？
Really?

293
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,172
如果她再光临
The next time she comes in...

294
00:27:12,247 --> 00:27:13,612
请她到我办公室
send her to my office

295
00:27:16,117 --> 00:27:17,049
没问题
You bet

296
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,250
但愿我爸是银行老板
Gee, I wish "my" daddy
owned a bank

297
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:27,556
我就能跟他一样臭屁
Then I could be a rich
little creep too

298
00:27:27,662 --> 00:27:29,527
她还会来吗？
You think she'll ever come back?

299
00:27:29,631 --> 00:27:33,260
别提她了.你听我的话
Oh, man, forget her. Listen to me

300
00:27:33,368 --> 00:27:36,826
她那种妞心中想的就是钓凯子
Girls like her always look for
the BBD: Bigger Better Deal

301
00:27:37,105 --> 00:27:39,300
你不了解她
You don't know that

302
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:42,399
她是艺术家，她.
She's an artist. She's...

303
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,637
感觉敏锐
忘掉她吧
- sensitive.
- Forget her

304
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:48,773
她会扯烂你的心
打成果汁喝
She'll rip out your heart,
put it in a blender and hit "frappe"

305
00:27:48,883 --> 00:27:52,751
你需要的是单纯的那一型
You don't need her.
You need somebody down to earth

306
00:27:52,821 --> 00:27:57,053
正派的女子
Somebody with some integrity.
Somebody with...

307
00:27:57,158 --> 00:27:58,318
有着一头红发
red hair...

308
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:00,291
噘着丰满的唇
fulI, pouting lips...

309
00:28:00,362 --> 00:28:02,626
白衫，绿外套
a white blouse, green jacket...

310
00:28:02,697 --> 00:28:04,062
戴识别证
and a name tag

311
00:28:04,165 --> 00:28:06,326
这范围太小了
You really narrowed it down

312
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,527
可惜被我包了
Too bad she's already taken

313
00:28:10,638 --> 00:28:13,163
你好，请问有何贵干？
Hello there, may I be of assistance?

314
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,242
你是史丹利伊卜吉？
Stanley Ipkiss?

315
00:28:18,313 --> 00:28:20,781
我叫佩姬，论坛报来的
Hi! I'm Peggy Brandt
from the Tribune

316
00:28:23,518 --> 00:28:26,715
我没续订你的报是因为
I canceled my subscription because
they kept stealing--

317
00:28:26,821 --> 00:28:29,654
我是有事问你才来的
No, actually, I want to ask you
a few questions

318
00:28:29,758 --> 00:28:32,454
真的吗？什么事？
Really? About what?

319
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,257
你是那修车厂的客户吗？
Ripley Auto Finishing.
You're a customer, aren't you?

320
00:28:39,267 --> 00:28:40,461
我？不是
Me?

321
00:28:41,403 --> 00:28:43,530
我根本没车
I don't even have a car

322
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:46,266
因为车辆会污染环境
You know, 'cause they pollute

323
00:28:46,374 --> 00:28:48,740
你有一辆八九年的喜美？
You don't own an '89 Civic?

324
00:28:51,212 --> 00:28:53,112
你说那一辆呀
Oh, that car, yeah

325
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,618
我想起来了
It's coming back to me

326
00:28:57,719 --> 00:29:00,210
请问芳名？
Miss... What was your name?

327
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:01,515
佩姬布兰
Peggy Brandt

328
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:03,748
且慢
Wait a minute

329
00:29:03,858 --> 00:29:05,587
你是佩姬布兰？
Peggy Brandt?

330
00:29:05,693 --> 00:29:07,251
那位专栏作家？
Of "Ask Peggy"?

331
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,127
没错
That's right

332
00:29:10,231 --> 00:29:12,927
去年你登出我的信
You printed one of my letters
last year

333
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:15,567
“好男人永难出头”
Remember? "Nice Guys Finish Last."

334
00:29:16,805 --> 00:29:18,238
你就是那位好男人？
You're Mister Nice Guy?

335
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:24,843
无数读者写信到报社问你
Do you realize how much mail
we got about that letter?

336
00:29:24,946 --> 00:29:28,347
几百位女子想找你这种人
100's of women are looking
for a guy like you

337
00:29:30,452 --> 00:29:32,545
真的吗？
Really?

338
00:29:32,654 --> 00:29:35,748
你知道好男人
有多难找吗？
You know how hard it is to find
a decent man in this town?

339
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,553
多数男人都是大色鬼
Most think monogamy is a kind of wood

340
00:29:43,465 --> 00:29:46,400
你为何采访这案子？
Why are you covering this story?

341
00:29:46,501 --> 00:29:50,232
写专栏酬劳低，快饿死了
Because "Dear Peggy" pays dick.
I'm starving to death

342
00:29:50,338 --> 00:29:52,431
我想当真正的记者
I'm looking to become a real reporter

343
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:56,499
你在修车厂
有看到可疑的事吗？
When you were at Ripley Auto
did you see anything suspicious?

344
00:29:56,611 --> 00:29:57,737
任何怪事？
Anything?

345
00:29:57,846 --> 00:29:59,780
我不会给你惹麻烦
I won't make trouble for you

346
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,439
我只要查明真相
I just want the truth

347
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:06,752
但愿我知道真相
我真的希望
God, I wish I knew the truth.
You know, I really do

348
00:30:09,924 --> 00:30:12,620
如果你想起来
If you think of anything...

349
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,592
就通知我
this is my number

350
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,454
这支电话...
This is my...

351
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,896
是我的专线
you know, personal number

352
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:23,635
真的有几百位女子
想找我？
100's of women are looking
for a guy like me?

353
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,000
当然了
Sure

354
00:30:26,307 --> 00:30:27,934
包括我在内
I'm one of them

你好，多利安
Hello, Dorian

357
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,027
感谢你光临
Thanks for dropping by

358
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:55,531
下次先打电话
别劳动你的狗腿子
Next time, call.
Leave the delivery boys at home

359
00:31:16,524 --> 00:31:18,549
今天早上
The cops...

360
00:31:18,826 --> 00:31:22,489
警察想查封夜总会
tried to shut the cIub
down this morning

361
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:27,263
警方说你用它掩饰犯罪
They say you've been using the place
to run your own small-time scams

362
00:31:27,368 --> 00:31:29,928
当我听到此事
When I hear things like that...

363
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:33,371
我开始分心了
I start losing my concentration

364
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:36,170
这一杆...
My game...

365
00:31:36,277 --> 00:31:39,337
万一打烂了
it goes straight to hell

366
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:44,110
你也会被打烂
You could too

367
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,811
二0五码
205 yards

368
00:31:47,922 --> 00:31:49,981
我受够你了
I'm fed up with you...

369
00:31:50,925 --> 00:31:52,256
但.
but....

370
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,021
我法外施恩
I'll cut you a break

371
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,599
给你一周滚出城
One week to get out of town

372
00:31:58,866 --> 00:32:00,891
如果你不滚
After that...

373
00:32:00,969 --> 00:32:05,497
我就用铁杆敲你脑袋
I'll use your empty little skulI
to break in my new nine iron

374
00:32:45,947 --> 00:32:47,414
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

375
00:32:47,515 --> 00:32:50,109
先生，你的车
Your car, sir

376
00:32:53,621 --> 00:32:55,555
见到你就没事了
I am now

377
00:33:13,274 --> 00:33:15,902
婷娜，别这样
Tina, come on

378
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,511
别这样
You can't

379
00:33:19,514 --> 00:33:21,106
别这样
You can't

380
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:26,152
痒死了
Go on

381
00:33:27,655 --> 00:33:30,249
春梦醒得真快
I don't believe it

382
00:33:50,144 --> 00:33:51,975
我太痴心了
Stupid

383
00:33:53,715 --> 00:33:55,615
她会爱我才怪
She would never...

384
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,576
不行
No way!

385
00:34:52,306 --> 00:34:54,137
等一下，蜜糖
Hold on, Sugar

Daddy's got a sweet tooth tonight

387

打遍天下无敌手
Somebody,stop me

388
00:35:21,636 --> 00:35:24,400
没钱就别想耍帅
Can't make the scene
if you don't have the green

389
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:26,632
我最好去捞一票
I better make a little stop

怎样了，傅立兹？
How's it going, Freeze?

392
00:35:38,753 --> 00:35:40,277
看来一帆风顺
It's looking good here

393
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:44,586
你们要靠自己了
我必须下楼让人看见
You're on your own. I must
go downstairs, make sure I'm seen

394
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:45,683
你去吧
Do it

傅立兹要出马了
The doctor is about to operate

大家好
How do?

400

你在名单上吗？
You on the list?

401

Love makes me treat you...

The way that I do
Gee, baby...

410
00:37:59,226 --> 00:38:02,423
ain't I good to you

411
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,556
There's nothing too good...

412
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:08,260
for a boy that's so true

413
00:38:08,336 --> 00:38:12,432
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

414
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,941
I bought you a fur coat
for Christmas

415
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,610
A diamond ring...

Love makes me treat you...

the way that I do

420
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:31,891
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

421
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:37,193
Love makes me treat you...

422

Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

424

There's nothing too good...

425
00:38:47,341 --> 00:38:50,208
for a man so true

426
00:38:50,311 --> 00:38:52,871
Gee,baby, ain't I good to you

427
00:38:54,548 --> 00:38:59,713
I know how to make a man happy
I'll treat you right

00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,817
你来干什么？
大势不妙

00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,389
我们走
Come on, let's go

431
00:39:15,002 --> 00:39:17,835
They got me paying taxes...

432
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,701
for what I gave to you

433
00:39:19,807 --> 00:39:23,743
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

434
00:39:44,432 --> 00:39:46,992
咱们来大闹天宫！
Let's rock this joint

435
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,341
乐歪了！
Smoking

436
00:41:04,411 --> 00:41:05,742
怎么回事？
What happened?

437
00:41:08,949 --> 00:41:11,110
有人抢先一步
Someone hit the joint before us

438
00:41:12,786 --> 00:41:14,083
来
Get that, Doc

439
00:41:15,589 --> 00:41:17,682
哈一管
Suck on that

440
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,695
天嫉英才呀
Son of a bitch!

441
00:41:28,869 --> 00:41:30,461
是谁干的？
Who did this, man?

442
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,163
是谁？
Who?!

443
00:41:33,107 --> 00:41:34,506
他
Him!

444
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:37,043
就是他
That's the guy

445
00:41:37,144 --> 00:41:39,544
婷娜的舞伴？
The guy dancing with Tina?

446
00:41:39,613 --> 00:41:41,410
他死定了
He's dead meat

447
00:41:41,515 --> 00:41:42,607
来
Come on

448
00:42:24,258 --> 00:42:26,055
马上给我清场
I want this place cleared now

449
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:47,209
打烊了，快走
不滚就试试看
CIub's closed. Move it!
You think I'm joking? Come on, move it!

450
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,472
派对结束了，走吧！
Party's over, let's go!

451
00:42:50,117 --> 00:42:51,516
婷娜，你走开
Get out of here

452
00:42:53,053 --> 00:42:53,985
滚一边去！
Get lost!

453
00:42:55,522 --> 00:42:57,149
摩登舞王，你听着
Okay, Twinkle Toes

454
00:42:57,224 --> 00:42:59,749
你马上告诉我钱在哪？
Where is my money, tell me now

455
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:09,269
你买国库券领利息
You've got 17.5% in T-bills
amortized over the fiscal year

456
00:43:09,536 --> 00:43:10,696
还买股票和债券
8% in stocks and bonds

457
00:43:10,804 --> 00:43:13,238
除以国民生产毛额
Carry the 9, divide by the GNP...

458
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:16,943
还好，你的葬礼花圈免税
Fortunately, funeral bouquets
are deductible

459
00:43:17,878 --> 00:43:19,539
干掉这活宝
Ice this deadbeat

460
00:43:25,953 --> 00:43:26,885
干掉他！
Shoot him!

461
00:43:32,259 --> 00:43:33,157
谢谢
Thanks

462
00:43:40,968 --> 00:43:43,562
你打中我了
You got me, partner

463
00:43:55,582 --> 00:43:58,278
抱紧我
Hold me close,Red

464
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:00,213
我眼前一片黑
It's getting dark

465
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:08,153
请阿姨别忘带老黄狗散步
Tell Auntie Em to let OId Yeller out

466
00:44:12,366 --> 00:44:15,529
耶诞节我不回家过了
Tell Tiny Tim I won't be coming home
this Christmas

467
00:44:20,174 --> 00:44:22,233
乱世佳人，其实我受你
Tell Scarlet I do give a damn

468
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:27,812
失礼了
Pardon me

469
00:44:36,623 --> 00:44:38,090
感谢捧场
Thank you

470
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,120
观众爱我
You love me

471
00:44:41,195 --> 00:44:44,164
你们真的爱我
You really love me

472
00:44:50,037 --> 00:44:52,198
你别想溜
You're not going anywhere

473
00:44:58,812 --> 00:45:00,245
枪放下
Drop it, Tyrel!

474
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,775
放下
Drop it

475
00:45:08,856 --> 00:45:12,417
有搜索票吗？还是想喝酒？
You got a warrant?
Or did you come for a nightcap?

476
00:45:13,727 --> 00:45:16,423
我手上有合理根据
What I got is probable cause

477
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:18,794
你的手下抢银行
Your boys knocked over Edge City Bank

478
00:45:18,899 --> 00:45:20,696
别乱摸，好痒
Easy. You're giving me a woody

479
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:23,463
其中一人戴着大绿面具
And one was wearing a big,
green mask

480
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:26,232
你难得说对一次
For once, you're right

481
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:28,604
但他不是我手下
Except it wasn't one of my boys

482
00:45:28,709 --> 00:45:32,338
你该确实查清楚才说
Maybe if you tried a little
actual police work...

483
00:45:32,446 --> 00:45:33,743
铐住他
Cuff him

484
00:45:33,847 --> 00:45:37,442
分队长，楼上有尸体
他是抢匪
We got a stiff upstairs.
It's a guy from the heist

485
00:45:37,551 --> 00:45:40,349
请你那高薪律师来
Call that high-priced
lawyer of yours

486
00:45:40,454 --> 00:45:42,684
咱们去警局聊聊
We'll go downtown for a chat

487
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:44,655
带走！
Get him out of here

488
00:46:04,812 --> 00:46:07,838
伊卜吉，我知道你在家
I know you're in there

489
00:46:10,784 --> 00:46:12,308
我是警察
Police!

490
00:46:14,288 --> 00:46:15,619
开门
Open up!

491
00:46:15,722 --> 00:46:18,418
妈祖娘娘呀
Oh, my God

492
00:46:21,261 --> 00:46:24,594
我知道你在里面
I know you're in there!

493
00:46:31,338 --> 00:46:32,396
开门
Open up!

494
00:46:32,506 --> 00:46:36,408
我敲得手起水泡了
Come on, I'm getting blisters
on my fingers

495
00:46:40,614 --> 00:46:41,638
不可以
Stop it

496
00:46:42,749 --> 00:46:43,909
别这样，我来了
I'm coming, okay

497
00:46:44,017 --> 00:46:46,577
马上就来
I'll be right there

498
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,919
快一点
Let's go, move it!

499
00:46:52,993 --> 00:46:54,927
好啦
AIright!

500
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,361
你好，分队长
Hi, Lieutenant

501
00:47:02,469 --> 00:47:05,996
现在我不方便
This isn't the best time right now.
I just--

502
00:47:06,273 --> 00:47:08,207
那请进吧！
Won't you come in?

503
00:47:10,944 --> 00:47:12,434
你昨晚在哪里？
Where were you last night?

504
00:47:13,447 --> 00:47:14,971
差不多都在家
Here, mostly

505
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:16,011
出了事吗？
Something wrong?

506
00:47:16,283 --> 00:47:18,217
你对面具怪客了解多少？
What do you know about The Mask?

507
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:20,377
面具怪客？
"Mask?"

508
00:47:20,487 --> 00:47:22,011
别给我装蒜
Don't insult my intelligence

509
00:47:22,289 --> 00:47:25,918
他抢你的银行
我在椰鼓找到碎布
He robs the bank you work in,
then I find this in the Coco Bongo

510
00:47:26,026 --> 00:47:28,654
这种骚睡衣只有你才有
There can't be 2 idiots
with these pajamas

511
00:47:31,031 --> 00:47:33,329
我想看看你的睡衣
May I see those pajamas?

512
00:47:35,636 --> 00:47:37,228
睡衣！
Those pajamas?

513
00:47:37,337 --> 00:47:40,238
那些睡衣...
Those pajamas...

514
00:47:41,475 --> 00:47:42,567
被偷了
were stolen

515
00:47:42,676 --> 00:47:45,372
睡衣会被人偷？
Somebody stole your pajamas?

516
00:47:50,651 --> 00:47:54,849
这个城市有够堕落的
What is this city coming to...

517
00:47:54,955 --> 00:48:00,291
男人的睡衣都有人偷
when a man's pajama drawer is
no longer safe!

518
00:48:05,532 --> 00:48:06,965
你看他
Look at that guy

519
00:48:07,067 --> 00:48:10,332
但愿我的员工有这么勤快
彼此彼此
- Nobody's that fast at my bank.
- I'll say

520
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,565
那橡皮面具真不赖
That's one hell of a rubber mask

521
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:16,870
化验室怎么说？
Lab reports?

522
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:21,573
钞票上有指纹，但不是多利安手下
We got fingerprints from currency,
but nothing matches Tyrel's men

523
00:48:21,682 --> 00:48:23,081
面具怪客比他们快
He beat them to the punch

524
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:28,014
查银行员工档案，核对伊卜吉的指纹
Get the bank employee files and run
down the prints on a guy named Ipkiss

525
00:48:28,088 --> 00:48:30,648
你认为有内贼？
You figure it was an inside job?

526
00:48:30,724 --> 00:48:34,353
找到指纹
我就能关他一辈子
I need some prints to lock
this whack job up till doomsday

527
00:48:36,797 --> 00:48:38,788
我悬赏五万元
50 grand...

528
00:48:38,899 --> 00:48:43,563
看谁比条子
先找到面具怪客
to whoever finds that green bastard
before the cops

529
00:48:43,637 --> 00:48:46,902
你们把话放出去
I want you to get the word out
to every street hustler...

530
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,771
传给边城每个混混和无赖
every low life in this town.
Understand?

531
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:52,937
明天把他抓来，要活的
I want him here tomorrow, alive

532
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,315
你们还等什么？
You still here?

533
00:48:56,383 --> 00:48:58,317
快去干活！
Come on, let's go

534
00:49:03,423 --> 00:49:04,981
你看什么？
What are you looking at?

535
00:49:05,092 --> 00:49:06,116
你
You

536
00:49:06,393 --> 00:49:07,860
乱掉方寸了
You're losing it

537
00:49:07,961 --> 00:49:11,727
我什么都没掉
I'm not losing anything...

538
00:49:11,832 --> 00:49:13,663
我只想甩掉一些累赘
except maybe some extra baggage

539
00:49:13,767 --> 00:49:15,394
什么意思？
What's that mean?

540
00:49:17,671 --> 00:49:20,970
昨晚他吻你，你没有反抗
You didn't fight much last night
when that freak kissed you

541
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:24,374
我反抗也没用呀
Did it look like I had much
of a choice?

542
00:49:25,612 --> 00:49:27,079
不见得吧
Maybe you did...

543
00:49:29,583 --> 00:49:32,074
也许是没用，反正天知道
maybe you didn't. Who knows, right?

544
00:49:33,854 --> 00:49:35,048
我告诉你
I'll tell you one thing

545
00:49:36,456 --> 00:49:39,619
谁惹毛我，我就找谁算帐
It's going to be payback for anybody
who crosses me

546
00:49:50,103 --> 00:49:53,732
银行出事
你还迟到一小时
We have a crisis here and you
stroll in an hour late?

547
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,774
我受够你这没路用的...
If I must put up with--

548
00:49:55,876 --> 00:49:58,674
滚你的，小金牛！
Back off, monkey boy...

549
00:49:58,779 --> 00:50:02,476
小心我向你老爸告状
or I'll tell your dad you treat
this place like your piggy bank

550
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:04,482
或是通知国税局
Or we should call the IRS...

551
00:50:04,551 --> 00:50:07,714
请你去调查局度假！
and arrange a vacation for you
at CIub Fed?

552
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:12,390
走着瞧
That'll be all

553
00:50:16,229 --> 00:50:17,423
大圣人呀
Genius

554
00:50:17,531 --> 00:50:21,194
你令我乐到心坎里
That was genius. Buddy, I have chills

555
00:50:21,301 --> 00:50:25,169
你今天嗑了什么魔药？
God! What side of whose bed
did you wake up on, man?

556
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,569
我也不清楚
I'm not sure

557
00:50:27,641 --> 00:50:30,132
我最近不大像自己
I haven't exactly been myself lately

558
00:50:30,243 --> 00:50:32,211
你的气色不佳
You don't look real fabulous

559
00:50:32,312 --> 00:50:34,280
真的吗？
Really, do I look bad?

560
00:50:35,515 --> 00:50:39,076
安啦，这会使你恢复神采
Don't worry. This'll put the color
back in your cheeks

561
00:50:39,186 --> 00:50:43,418
椰鼓办慈善舞会，周六晚
2 tickets to the charity ball
at the Coco Bongo CIub, Saturday

562
00:50:43,523 --> 00:50:46,048
大人物都将到场
Anybody who's anybody will be there

563
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:48,024
陪我去吧？
Want to be my date?

564
00:50:54,434 --> 00:50:57,028
先等一下
Wait just a minute

565
00:50:57,104 --> 00:51:00,369
你怎么来了？
我来向你道谢
- Why are you here?
- I wanted to thank you

566
00:51:01,541 --> 00:51:04,408
我没钱开户了
I don't have much to open an account
with anymore

567
00:51:04,511 --> 00:51:07,742
你在夜总会很红呀
What about the cIub?
You were doing great

568
00:51:08,014 --> 00:51:10,676
别为我操心，没事的
It's not your problem.
I'll be okay

569
00:51:10,784 --> 00:51:12,513
跟我来
Come here

570
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:20,689
你不只是来看我吧？
You didn't stop by just to see me,
did you?

571
00:51:23,096 --> 00:51:24,586
没关系，告诉我
It's okay, tell me

572
00:51:27,367 --> 00:51:30,063
那个抢银行的人
The guy they say robbed this place...

573
00:51:30,137 --> 00:51:33,004
面具怪客？
他去过夜总会
- The Mask?
- I think he was at the cIub

574
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,304
真的？
Really?

575
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:38,003
听说他长得...
They say he's pretty...

576
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,169
有够怪异
weird looking

577
00:51:42,415 --> 00:51:43,973
不过...
Yeah, but...

578
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:46,348
他是舞林豪杰
you should see him dance

579
00:51:48,155 --> 00:51:51,522
他到底是何方神圣？
Did anyone find out who he is?

580
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:53,684
你有兴趣吗？
Why, you interested?

581
00:51:55,629 --> 00:51:57,688
我只是好奇
Just curious, I guess

582
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:03,360
我该走了
I better be going

583
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:05,438
谢谢你一番心意
Thanks for everything

584
00:52:07,174 --> 00:52:08,641
你想再见到他，对不对？
You'd like to see him again?

585
00:52:14,748 --> 00:52:16,340
那就麻烦你了
I wouldn't mind

586
00:52:16,449 --> 00:52:19,111
我认识他
I know him, you know

587
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,709
真的？
You do?

588
00:52:20,821 --> 00:52:24,052
我们是大学同窗
We're old college buddies,
him and me

589
00:52:25,425 --> 00:52:28,690
你提到他的舞技
It's funny you mention
he dances because...

590
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:35,827
有些舞步是我教他的
I taught him a couple of
dance moves myself

591
00:52:36,102 --> 00:52:39,162
我今晚能见到他吗？
Think you could have him
meet me tonight?

592
00:52:39,272 --> 00:52:41,331
我想办法
Maybe I could work something out

593
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:44,343
在公园好吗？
日落时分
- How about at Landfill Park?
- Sunset

594
00:52:44,444 --> 00:52:46,309
太好了
- Perfect.
- Super

595
00:52:47,614 --> 00:52:51,175
谢了，你真是大好人
Thanks, Stanley.
You really are a nice guy

596
00:52:58,124 --> 00:53:00,285
这玩意很有意思
This is an interesting place

597
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:03,454
像四、五世纪的北欧面具
Looks like fourth-
or fifth-century Scandinavian

598
00:53:03,563 --> 00:53:07,863
可能是北欧的一位夜神
也许是洛基
Possibly a representation of one
of the Norse night gods, maybe Loki

599
00:53:10,737 --> 00:53:12,602
洛基？
Loki?

600
00:53:12,706 --> 00:53:14,196
洛基是谁？
Who is Loki?

601
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,640
北欧的恶作剧之神
The Norse god of mischief

602
00:53:16,743 --> 00:53:21,680
他是闯祸大王
天父将他永远逐出天宫
Supposedly he caused such trouble that
Odin banished him from Valhalla forever

603
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:26,480
也许他被贬到面具里
Then he could have banished him
into that mask

604
00:53:26,586 --> 00:53:29,612
那都是神话
I'm talking about mythology,
Mr. Ipkiss

605
00:53:29,689 --> 00:53:31,623
这只是一块木头
This is a piece of wood

606
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,218
但你的书...
but your book...!

607
00:53:34,327 --> 00:53:37,728
我的书是拿面具做比喻
My book is about
masks as a metaphor

608
00:53:37,831 --> 00:53:40,857
不是照字面去解释
A metaphor,not to be taken literally

609
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:42,863
你患了轻微的妄想症
You suffer from a mild delusion

610
00:53:46,206 --> 00:53:47,537
好吧
AIright

611
00:53:50,944 --> 00:53:52,639
我证明给你看
I'll prove it to you

612
00:53:53,847 --> 00:53:57,442
但后果我不负责
But I am not responsible
for the consequences

613
00:53:57,517 --> 00:54:01,419
坐下来欣赏吧，大专家
Just sit back and enjoy the ride,
Mr. Expert

614
00:54:01,521 --> 00:54:04,490
有啥好怕的，请便
You don't scare me.
Go right ahead

615
00:54:05,859 --> 00:54:07,759
再见
See you

616
00:54:32,919 --> 00:54:37,413
洛基是夜神
也许晚上才有效
You said Loki was a night god.
Maybe it works at night

617
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:42,894
先生，我警告你
我不亲自辅导重症患者
I should warn you that I don't work
personally with really sick people

618
00:54:42,963 --> 00:54:46,421
你该去找私人机构
There are private institutions
for those things

619
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:50,492
如果你想入院，我今晚就能帮你安排
I can arrange for a safe environment
for you tonight, if you want

620
00:54:54,641 --> 00:54:56,438
我一定要见婷娜
I must see Tina

621
00:54:57,644 --> 00:54:59,339
但我该怎么办？
But what can I do?

622
00:55:00,246 --> 00:55:02,305
以原来面貌去？
Do I go as myself...

623
00:55:02,415 --> 00:55:03,848
或是戴上面具？
or The Mask?

624
00:55:05,452 --> 00:55:09,548
我说完，你就离开好吗？
If I tell you, you promise
to leave my office right now?

625
00:55:16,262 --> 00:55:17,957
本貌
Go as yourself...

626
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:20,392
和面具一起去
and as The Mask

627
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:24,766
他们是一体的
都是大好人
Because they are both
one and the same beautiful person

628
00:55:26,439 --> 00:55:29,738
指纹证实是伊卜吉的
Got the cross-check on
the fingerprints. It's Ipkiss

629
00:55:29,843 --> 00:55:31,208
我正盯着他
I'm looking at him

630
00:55:31,311 --> 00:55:33,677
叫霹雳小组待命
Keep the SWAT team standing by

631
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:37,477
若他真那么难缠
就得闹一夜
If he's half as bad as they say,
we'll have a fulI dance card

632
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,347
有泡菜酱吗？
Pickle relish?

633
00:55:39,452 --> 00:55:42,353
上车
我还点了洋葱圈
- Get in the car.
- But I ordered onion rings

634
00:55:46,626 --> 00:55:48,753
LANDFILL PARK

635
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:11,908
史丹利，你怎么来了？
What are you doing here?

636
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:18,690
我只是路过来确定你们见到面
I wanted to make sure that you
2 got together all right

637
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,589
你真好
That's nice

638
00:56:20,693 --> 00:56:23,958
我很少来这里
I hardly ever stop by here

639
00:56:24,064 --> 00:56:26,294
真想不到这里曾是...
It's hard to believe it was...

640
00:56:26,399 --> 00:56:27,491
垃圾场
a garbage heap

641
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:34,740
日落时分真美
It's really beautiful
right around sunset

642
00:56:34,841 --> 00:56:38,800
沼气加深了天色
The methane emissions
really pick up the colors

643
00:56:38,912 --> 00:56:40,402
满天的...
All those...

644
00:56:40,513 --> 00:56:42,947
姹绿嫣红
pinks and greens

645
00:56:49,389 --> 00:56:52,517
他随时会到，我走了
My friend will be along here
any minute. I better go

646
00:56:54,461 --> 00:56:56,088
等等，史丹利
Stanley, wait

647
00:57:02,535 --> 00:57:04,059
你好，心肝儿
Hello, cherie

648
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:06,362
我们重逢了
We meet again!

649
00:57:06,473 --> 00:57:07,667
这是命运吗？
Is it fate?

650
00:57:07,774 --> 00:57:10,709
是否星辰上面写着
Is it meant to be?
It is written in the stars...

651
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:13,335
我们注定要相好？
that we are destined to fraternize?

652
00:57:13,413 --> 00:57:16,109
我愿意这样想
I'd like to think so

653
00:57:20,453 --> 00:57:24,947
吻我，我就奉献给你
Kiss me, my dear, and I will reveal
my croissant

654
00:57:25,058 --> 00:57:29,859
我带你同奔极乐
我带你共浴瑶池
I will spread your p t . I will dip
my ladle in your vichyssoise

655
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,468
她可真怕羞
She's so coy

656
00:57:36,569 --> 00:57:38,537
我喜欢
I love it

657
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:48,002
我们的爱像红红的玫瑰
Our love is like a red, red rose

658
00:57:48,081 --> 00:57:50,675
令我兴奋莫名
And I am a little thorny

659
00:57:50,783 --> 00:57:53,343
我爱慕你
Je t'adore! Je t'adore!

660
00:57:53,453 --> 00:57:55,512
说法文比较不恶心
Shoot the window. I don't care!

661
00:57:57,524 --> 00:58:00,084
我是凯拉威，加派人手来
This is Kellaway.
I need back-up

662
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:02,990
抽烟吗？不抽？
Cigarette?

663
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:17,502
我好像拿破仑
Now, like Napoleon...

664
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:20,978
分散敌军，各个击破
I will divide and conquer

665
00:58:21,948 --> 00:58:24,041
我是警察！
Police!

666
00:58:25,518 --> 00:58:26,416
电灯泡
Merde

667
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:28,817
“别动”
Freeze

668
00:58:32,125 --> 00:58:33,558
手举起来
Put your hands up

669
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:35,821
你不是叫我“结冻”？
But you told me to freeze

670
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:39,057
好啦，化冻
AIright, alright, unfreeze

671
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:42,197
你被捕了
You're under arrest

672
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:45,029
不是我干的
It wasn't me

673
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:47,664
是“绝命追杀令”那独臂人
It was the one-armed man

674
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,200
好吧，我招了
AIright, I confess

675
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:53,742
是我干的，我非常得意
I did it, you hear?
And I'm glad, glad, I tell you!

676
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:59,517
警伯，他们会把我怎样？
What are they going to do to me, Sarge?
What are they going to do?

677
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:02,816
抱歉，不关我的事
Sorry, son, that's not my department

678
00:59:02,922 --> 00:59:04,048
搜身
Search him

679
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,792
应该拍下来告你们刑求
Where's a camcorder when you need one?

680
00:59:14,934 --> 00:59:18,199
今晚搞不完了
老婆会宰了我
It's going to be a long night.
My wife'll kill me

681
00:59:18,271 --> 00:59:21,934
怎么了？
伊卜吉在公园被捕
- What is it?
- Cops got Ipkiss at Landfill Park

682
00:59:22,041 --> 00:59:25,738
让我去采访这案子
你回家陪老婆
Let me cover it. I need this story.
You go home to Claire

683
00:59:25,845 --> 00:59:27,938
可是上面说...
I don't know. Ramsey said--

684
00:59:28,047 --> 00:59:30,208
我去跟上面说
I will take care of Ramsey

685
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:32,041
感激不尽，算我欠你
Thanks a million, I owe you one

686
00:59:33,219 --> 00:59:35,744
超大墨镜
Really big sunglasses, nerf ball...

687
00:59:35,855 --> 00:59:38,153
单车喇叭
Bike horn...

688
00:59:38,224 --> 00:59:41,091
小嘴鲈鱼
Small-mouthed bass...
bowling pin...

689
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:44,854
捕鼠器
mouse-trap...

690
00:59:44,931 --> 00:59:46,558
橡皮鸡
rubber chicken...

691
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:49,726
吃这个也痒，吃那个也痒
- Little to the left. That's it.
- I don't know

692
00:59:49,802 --> 00:59:51,770
玩具眼珠
Funny eyeball glasses...

693
00:59:51,871 --> 00:59:54,101
没看过这种眼镜
I've never seen those in my life

694
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:56,266
火箭筒
我有执照的
- bazooka.
- I have a permit for that

695
00:59:57,577 --> 00:59:59,477
凯拉威夫人玉照
- Picture of Kellaway's wife...
- What?

696
01:00:00,146 --> 01:00:01,670
“爱人，我等你”
CalL ME LOVER!

697
01:00:01,748 --> 01:00:03,773
你勾引我老婆！
Margaret! Son of a bitch!

698
01:00:03,883 --> 01:00:08,081
我还以为你幽默
I figured you had a sense of humor

699
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:09,484
毕竟...夫妻一场嘛
you married her!

700
01:00:11,958 --> 01:00:14,586
这够痛了吧
That's got to hurt

701
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:15,922
抓住他
Get him!

702
01:00:39,585 --> 01:00:42,019
伊卜吉，把手举起来
It's over. Raise your hands...

703
01:00:42,121 --> 01:00:44,112
否则开火
or we'll fire

704
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:48,818
开枪
Hit it!

705
01:01:09,816 --> 01:01:13,775
人家叫我古巴皮
我是伦巴舞皇帝
They call me Cuban Pete
I'm the king of the rumba beat

706
01:01:13,886 --> 01:01:15,319
当我摇起响葫芦
When I play the maracas

707
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:17,180
我就劈哩啪啦碰
I go chick-chicky boom

708
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:19,956
是的，吾乃古巴皮
Yes, I'm Cuban Pete

709
01:01:20,026 --> 01:01:22,221
人间就属我最皮
I'm the craze of my street

710
01:01:22,328 --> 01:01:26,560
当我跳起舞，劈哩啪啦碰
When I start to dance everything goes
Chick-chicky boom, chick-chicky boom

711
01:01:26,666 --> 01:01:28,725
妞儿唱歌...
The seoritas sing...

712
01:01:28,835 --> 01:01:31,030
又跳舞
and they swing

713
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,038
跳得又帅又惹火
It's very nice

714
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,164
跳得人心痒难熬
FulI of spice

715
01:01:35,241 --> 01:01:39,575
她们唱歌又跳舞 跳的真不错
They dance and bring a happy ring
Never a care

716
01:01:39,645 --> 01:01:43,581
从早到晚，笙歌不辍
Singing a song
All the day long

717
01:01:46,185 --> 01:01:49,916
若你喜欢这节奏
就来学我古巴皮
If you like the beat
Take a lesson from Cuban Pete

718
01:01:50,022 --> 01:01:52,183
脸贴着脸黏巴达
I'll teach you to
chick-chicky boom

719
01:01:54,327 --> 01:01:56,295
他这男人真内向
He's a modest guy

720
01:01:56,396 --> 01:01:58,762
不过却是万人迷
AIthough he's the hottest guy

721
01:01:58,865 --> 01:02:02,733
哈瓦那的万人迷
In Havana

722
01:02:02,835 --> 01:02:04,860
是的，小姐，我知道
Si, senorita, I know...

723
01:02:04,937 --> 01:02:07,371
that when I chicky boom

724
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,837
我是又帅又惹火
It's very nice
so fulI of spice

725
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:13,036
我把手放你身上
I place my hand on your hip

726
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,842
让你赏我几耳光
And if you will give me your hand

727
01:02:15,948 --> 01:02:19,884
那么你我就起舞
Then we shall try
Just you and I

728
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:23,850
热情有劲
闭嘴，拉我一把
- Not bad.
- Shut up and help me down

729
01:02:23,956 --> 01:02:27,653
我会教你跳这支舞
I'll teach you to chick-chicky boom
Chick-chicky boom

730
01:02:49,282 --> 01:02:51,682
再跳就轰掉你的狗头
Dance and I'll blow your brains out

731
01:02:56,088 --> 01:02:57,316
枪给我
Give me that thing

732
01:02:58,958 --> 01:03:00,016
后会有期
See you!

733
01:03:00,126 --> 01:03:04,256
去抓他
醒过来，别跳了！
There! Let's get him.
Snap out of it. This dance is over!

734
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:06,854
走呀，同志们
Let's go! Follow me, officers!

735
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:16,398
他在巷子里
拿着枪跟我来
He's down the alley. Follow me.
Come on. Grab your gun

736
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:39,030
史丹利，上车
Stanley, get in!

737
01:03:40,466 --> 01:03:41,490
在那边
There!

738
01:03:43,636 --> 01:03:45,729
再跑就开枪
Halt, or I'll shoot!

739
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:48,866
开枪呀
Shoot! Shoot!

740
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:52,602
不绑安全带会罚款
Seat belts

741
01:03:56,816 --> 01:03:57,942
我没打中
I missed him

742
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:01,815
谁打得中他
Come on, we all missed him

743
01:04:04,891 --> 01:04:07,792
“面具怪客抢银行”
THE MASK ROBS BANK

744
01:04:07,894 --> 01:04:09,657
我看到了
I saw it

745
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:12,393
全都看到了
I saw everything

746
01:04:13,399 --> 01:04:15,663
史丹利，你是怎么了？
What's happening to you, Stanley?

747
01:04:18,037 --> 01:04:19,971
我发疯了
It's crazy

748
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:27,139
我无法控制自己
I'm losing control

749
01:04:27,413 --> 01:04:29,438
当我戴上面具
When I put that mask on...

750
01:04:29,549 --> 01:04:31,540
我就能做任何事
I can do anything

751
01:04:31,651 --> 01:04:34,552
变成任何东西
Be anything

752
01:04:37,657 --> 01:04:39,818
它毁灭着我
It's wrecking my life

753
01:04:39,926 --> 01:04:43,919
害我过得一塌糊涂
My life is wrecked. Wrecked

754
01:04:45,565 --> 01:04:48,557
这些我并不清楚
I don't know what's happening to you...

755
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:52,369
但我明白一点
but I do know this:

756
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:56,807
写信到我专栏的那人
that letter you sent my column...

757
01:04:56,909 --> 01:04:59,844
他的勇气十足
that was from a guy with more guts...

758
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,745
心地善良
and more heart...

759
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:06,080
强过全城所有的烂男人
than any of the creeps
I've met in this city

760
01:05:06,185 --> 01:05:09,382
不管那是什么面具
Whatever that mask is...

761
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:10,750
你都不需要了
you don't need it

762
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:12,988
你
You...

763
01:05:13,893 --> 01:05:16,157
史丹利伊卜吉
Stanley Ipkiss...

764
01:05:16,429 --> 01:05:19,626
你只需做好你自己
are already all you'll ever need to be

765
01:05:23,903 --> 01:05:25,962
佩姬
Gosh, Peg...

766
01:05:27,773 --> 01:05:29,536
这是你的真心话吗？
do you really mean that?

767
01:05:30,943 --> 01:05:33,104
老实说...
Actually...

768
01:05:33,212 --> 01:05:34,406
不见得
no

769
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:35,946
什么？
What?

770
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:40,986
你们害我
多扯二十分钟的谎
Where were you? I've been vamping
for 20 minutes

771
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:42,988
就是他？
Is this him?

772
01:05:43,055 --> 01:05:44,989
五万块呢？
You got the 50 thou'?

773
01:05:46,058 --> 01:05:48,049
把钱给她
Give her the money

774
01:05:51,263 --> 01:05:52,696
很好
Right

775
01:05:52,765 --> 01:05:55,495
他戴上面具就变成怪客
With the mask on, he turns
into that green thing

776
01:05:58,604 --> 01:06:00,231
你这是干什么？
What are you doing?

777
01:06:00,506 --> 01:06:05,637
抱歉，你的确是好人
但我缺钱就没房子住
Sorry. You really are a great guy,
I just can't lose my condo

778
01:06:05,745 --> 01:06:08,771
在市内找房子太难了
It's so hard to find an apartment
in this city

779
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:15,209
你说过不会伤害他
You said you wouldn't hurt him!

780
01:06:18,524 --> 01:06:19,616
我骗你的
I lied

781
01:06:38,644 --> 01:06:40,236
告诉我
Tell me

782
01:06:40,346 --> 01:06:41,677
面具有什么奇效？
How's this mask work?

783
01:06:41,781 --> 01:06:44,614
我也不清楚
I don't know. You just...

784
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:46,809
你戴上就知道
put it on

785
01:06:59,699 --> 01:07:00,859
老板
Boss...

786
01:07:01,801 --> 01:07:03,428
保重呀
be careful, huh?

787
01:07:23,422 --> 01:07:25,481
酷得歪七扭八
What a rush

788
01:07:26,826 --> 01:07:30,694
你还好吗？
You okay?

789
01:07:31,764 --> 01:07:33,732
我从未这么好过
I'm better than ever, you idiot

790
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:38,130
怎样处置伊卜吉？
What do we do with Ipkiss?

791
01:07:40,439 --> 01:07:42,373
警方要面具
The police want the mask

792
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:45,444
就把面具怪客送警
We'll give them The Mask

793
01:07:55,588 --> 01:07:57,886
最好找得到钱
The money better be here...

794
01:07:57,957 --> 01:08:00,585
否则你就是夭寿怪客
or you can Ip-kiss your ass good-bye

795
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:48,998
在这里
Get over there

796
01:09:00,986 --> 01:09:04,217
想不到
干练警员沿街起舞
Can't believe it. Hardened cops
dancing in the street...

797
01:09:04,323 --> 01:09:06,689
在夜间新闻播出
and broadcast on the 11 o'clock news

798
01:09:06,792 --> 01:09:09,590
赌城还请霹雳小组去作秀
我完了
- The SWAT team was offered Vegas.
- I'm history

799
01:09:09,695 --> 01:09:13,654
队长会炒我鱿鱼
退休金泡汤
The Captain'll have my badge
for breakfast with a pension on top

800
01:09:13,766 --> 01:09:17,395
这不能怪你
吉人自有天相
It's not all your fault.
Something will turn up

801
01:09:17,503 --> 01:09:21,030
除非伊卜吉掉在我怀里
Sure, Ipkiss will fall
right into my lap

802
01:09:27,847 --> 01:09:29,781
把他弄开！
Get him off of me!

803
01:09:34,854 --> 01:09:36,014
等等
Wait!

804
01:09:36,288 --> 01:09:37,880
让我解释清楚
I can explain everything

805
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:41,790
是吗？那你解释这个
You can explain everything?
Explain this!

806
01:09:43,028 --> 01:09:46,429
铐起来
我为你准备了客房
Get him up! Let's go!
I got a cell for you, pal

807
01:10:10,055 --> 01:10:11,545
忘了我吧
Forget about me, buddy

808
01:10:11,657 --> 01:10:13,852
找一个新窝
Find a new place to live

809
01:10:16,428 --> 01:10:18,726
我要关好久好久
I'll be in here for a long, long time

810
01:10:32,011 --> 01:10:33,842
喂，丑八怪
You, with the face

811
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,507
有访客
You got a visitor

812
01:10:45,691 --> 01:10:48,319
你怎么来了？
是真的吗？
- Why?
- Is it true?

813
01:10:50,129 --> 01:10:51,619
你就是面具怪客
You're The Mask

814
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:54,858
别跟任何人说
Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
If I get...

815
01:10:54,967 --> 01:10:57,936
只要找到好律师
a good lawyer and a deal...

816
01:10:58,037 --> 01:11:00,335
我再关一万年就可以出狱
I'll be out in about 10,000 years

817
01:11:00,439 --> 01:11:02,600
你来这里太危险
It's risky, coming here

818
01:11:02,708 --> 01:11:05,108
你男友会不爽的
Your boyfriend might be upset

819
01:11:06,812 --> 01:11:10,873
他今晚要去慈善舞会做坏事
He'll be at the charity ball tonight

820
01:11:10,983 --> 01:11:13,383
他想跳黏巴达吗？
Like what? The Lambada?

821
01:11:13,452 --> 01:11:17,548
别耍嘴皮了，一定要阻止他
This is serious. There must be a way
to stop him

822
01:11:17,656 --> 01:11:19,715
它有什么魔力？
How does it work?

823
01:11:20,626 --> 01:11:21,923
我不知道
I don't know

824
01:11:22,828 --> 01:11:25,422
好像是...
It's like...

825
01:11:25,497 --> 01:11:28,830
它使人最隐密的欲望成真
it brings your innermost desires
to life

826
01:11:28,901 --> 01:11:31,131
若你的内心深处
If deep down inside...

827
01:11:32,638 --> 01:11:35,664
略带压抑却又浪漫至情
you're a bit repressed and
hopelessly romantic...

828
01:11:35,741 --> 01:11:37,800
那你就会变成
you become some sort of...

829
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:40,606
为爱痴狂的浪人
a love-crazy wild man

830
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:42,681
如果是多利安戴它呢？
And if you're like Dorian?

831
01:11:42,781 --> 01:11:45,579
那大家都完了
Then we're all in big trouble

832
01:11:45,684 --> 01:11:48,619
若我是你
就马上远走高飞
And if I were you,
I'd get out of town. Fast

833
01:11:51,190 --> 01:11:52,384
感谢你
Thanks

834
01:11:53,359 --> 01:11:54,417
谢什么？
For what?

835
01:11:54,526 --> 01:11:56,721
很多事
Lots of things

836
01:12:00,499 --> 01:12:03,093
你与我分享夕阳
Sharing a sunset with me

837
01:12:03,168 --> 01:12:08,333
只有你把我当人看
For being the only guy who treated me
like a person, not...

838
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:09,498
而非当玩物
a party favor

839
01:12:13,045 --> 01:12:15,639
感谢你一片深情
For being any kind of romantic...

840
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:17,545
虽然浪漫得无药可救
even a hopeless one

841
01:12:23,455 --> 01:12:25,184
不客气
You're welcome

842
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:27,781
那晚在夜总会
That night at the cIub I knew...

843
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:30,824
我邂逅了意中人
I'd found someone special

844
01:12:33,532 --> 01:12:36,296
面具怪客
The Mask

845
01:12:36,368 --> 01:12:39,303
不，是面具后面的男子
It was the guy inside The Mask

846
01:12:39,405 --> 01:12:42,841
就是你本人
It was you all along

847
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:51,042
小姐，时间到
Lady, time's up

848
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:53,084
拜托宽限...
Could I have just...

849
01:12:53,152 --> 01:12:55,052
一分钟？
one more minute?

850
01:12:56,855 --> 01:12:59,289
我要躲藏一阵子
I've got to disappear for a while now

851
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:03,088
我找到地方
会尽快通知你
Don't know where but I'll let you know
as soon as I can

852
01:13:47,573 --> 01:13:49,700
救命呀
Somebody help me!

853
01:13:54,613 --> 01:13:56,274
警卫
Guard, guard!

854
01:13:56,381 --> 01:13:59,578
有人在巷内追杀女子
A woman's being chased in the alley

855
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:01,585
快去救她呀
She needs help

856
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:04,417
罗嗦，小声一点
Sure. Keep it down

857
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:07,253
你算什么人民保姆！
Serve and protect, man!

858
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:30,181
好孩子，来
Good boy. Come on

859
01:14:32,317 --> 01:14:34,444
跳上来，会吗？
Jump up. Can you jump up?

860
01:14:36,221 --> 01:14:39,156
我曾教你别乱跳
现在收回成命
Remember how I taught you not to
jump up on people? Forget that

861
01:14:39,258 --> 01:14:41,226
跳上来
Come on! Get up here

862
01:14:43,462 --> 01:14:45,327
上来呀
Get up. Get up here!

863
01:14:46,298 --> 01:14:48,732
跳上来呀
Get up. Get up here. That's it

864
01:14:48,834 --> 01:14:51,325
你是神犬，没问题
You can do it.
Come on. Come on!

865
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:56,498
用力跳
Put some effort into it!

866
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:15,958
宝贝，总算找到你了
Baby, there you are

867
01:15:16,028 --> 01:15:17,893
我不大放心你
I was worried about you

868
01:15:17,996 --> 01:15:21,989
你找条子告密？
我只有问伊卜吉的事
- You talk to the cops?
- Only to see what Ipkiss told them

869
01:15:22,267 --> 01:15:26,294
你跟他走得太近了吧
That's right, you and Stanley.
You two are getting awfully close

870
01:15:27,406 --> 01:15:29,431
他抢银行想必是你帮他
Bet you helped him with the bank job

871
01:15:29,541 --> 01:15:32,339
胡说
是吗？
- That's ridiculous.
- Oh, is it?

872
01:15:33,645 --> 01:15:36,011
她车上有行李
Look what I found in her car

873
01:15:37,916 --> 01:15:39,281
想一个人溜吗？
Going away alone, baby?

874
01:15:43,522 --> 01:15:45,581
喽罗们
Boys, I want you to...

875
01:15:45,691 --> 01:15:48,216
给她找件漂亮衣服
get her something pretty to wear

876
01:15:50,529 --> 01:15:53,327
今晚有宴会
We're going to a party tonight

877
01:15:53,398 --> 01:15:55,992
要痛快飙一晚
We'll have one hell of a time, right?

878
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:59,035
你滚一边去
Get out of my sight

879
01:16:00,439 --> 01:16:01,736
跳呀
Jump up

880
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:02,967
百尺竿头，更进一步
Get up. Come on

881
01:16:04,943 --> 01:16:07,741
麦乐，拜托你跳
Come on, Milo. Jump, please

882
01:16:07,846 --> 01:16:09,939
为你老子跳一个
Do it for Daddy

883
01:16:13,785 --> 01:16:15,616
酷呆了
That's it!

884
01:16:16,955 --> 01:16:19,651
真想不到
God, I can't believe it

885
01:16:21,059 --> 01:16:23,789
我的乖孩子
Good boy. Good boy

886
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:28,796
看到那个人吗？
See that man over there?

887
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:30,527
他有钥匙
He's got keys

888
01:16:32,371 --> 01:16:34,032
把钥匙弄来
Go get those keys

889
01:16:34,306 --> 01:16:36,774
去偷钥匙
Go get them. Go get the keys

890
01:16:39,311 --> 01:16:40,278
对了
That's it

891
01:16:41,647 --> 01:16:42,614
钥匙
The key

892
01:16:48,587 --> 01:16:50,748
不是起司，是钥匙
No, not the cheese, the keys

893
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:54,925
放下起司
Drop the cheese...

894
01:16:56,461 --> 01:16:57,860
去偷钥匙
and get the keys

895
01:16:57,929 --> 01:17:00,557
在那边
Over there, over there

896
01:17:17,282 --> 01:17:19,580
乖狗儿，过来
Oh, man. Come on

897
01:17:19,785 --> 01:17:23,744
我的好祖宗
Come here. Good boy. That's a good boy

898
01:17:23,955 --> 01:17:27,413
把钥匙给我
Give it, give me the keys.
Give me the keys

899
01:17:27,592 --> 01:17:30,083
松口啦
Come on, drop it, drop it

900
01:17:30,362 --> 01:17:32,421
太阳下山了
It's sundown

901
01:17:32,531 --> 01:17:34,362
好戏开锣了
It's almost time

902
01:17:36,034 --> 01:17:37,934
我劝你别点烟
I wouldn't, darling

903
01:17:39,771 --> 01:17:40,931
（炸药，危险）
DANGER
EXPLOSIVES

904
01:17:41,039 --> 01:17:43,940
别这么早放烟火
Wouldn't want to start the
celebration early

905
01:18:28,453 --> 01:18:29,477
不要动
Hold it!

906
01:18:29,588 --> 01:18:31,385
我警告你
I am warning you...

907
01:18:31,456 --> 01:18:33,617
你逼得我要发飙了
I am seriously stressed out here

908
01:18:33,725 --> 01:18:35,022
放轻松
Easy

909
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:37,027
过来
Come on

910
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:38,357
别活得不耐烦
Don't be an idiot

911
01:18:38,463 --> 01:18:43,093
这里是警察局
你不可能出得去
You're in a police station. There is no
way you'll walk out of here like this

912
01:18:44,569 --> 01:18:46,230
你说得对
You're know, you're right

913
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:51,673
一点也没错
你干什么？
- Absolutely right.
- What are you doing?

914
01:18:53,111 --> 01:18:54,601
咱们玩...
You'll take me out...

915
01:18:54,713 --> 01:18:56,476
官兵抓强盗
as your prisoner

916
01:18:56,581 --> 01:18:59,311
铐上！
Put it on! Put it on!

917
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:02,184
走
Come on

918
01:19:02,287 --> 01:19:05,017
我很遗憾
- I'm really very sorry about this.
- I'm sure

919
01:19:08,093 --> 01:19:09,685
你们抓错人了
You got the wrong guy

920
01:19:09,795 --> 01:19:11,285
我是冤大头
It's a bum rap

921
01:19:11,363 --> 01:19:13,092
要尊重人权嘛
I got my rights

922
01:19:13,198 --> 01:19:15,132
你为何带走伊卜吉？
Where are you taking Ipkiss?

923
01:19:15,233 --> 01:19:18,225
“枪有他”
Ixnay! Ehay's otgay an ungay

924
01:19:18,336 --> 01:19:21,669
原来你倒过来讲
I get it. Pig Latin, right?

925
01:19:21,773 --> 01:19:23,707
“见头回”
Eesay ouyay aterlay

926
01:19:25,243 --> 01:19:26,335
来呀
Come on!

927
01:19:34,152 --> 01:19:36,586
你坐好，放轻松
Sit back and relax

928
01:19:39,124 --> 01:19:41,490
我要更衣赴宴
I must change for the party

929
01:19:51,603 --> 01:19:54,071
“豪睹之夜”
TONIGHT, CASINO

930
01:19:57,175 --> 01:19:59,666
“战火孤儿基金”
WAR ORPHANS FUND

931
01:20:13,558 --> 01:20:14,525
买烟
I need cigarettes

932
01:20:14,593 --> 01:20:16,857
什么牌子？
无所谓，我不抽烟
- Which brand?
- It doesn't matter, I don't smoke

933
01:20:16,928 --> 01:20:19,726
但我会帮你杀掉卫生署长
But for you, I would shoot
the Surgeon General

934
01:20:21,266 --> 01:20:23,200
条顿市长，可以访问您吗？
Mayor Tilton, may we have a word?

935
01:20:23,301 --> 01:20:27,567
我一向
欢迎新闻界和忠心选民
I always have time for the press
and my loyal constituents

936
01:21:03,742 --> 01:21:06,472
放开我，你开车太恐怖
Let me out of these cuffs,
you drive like a maniac

937
01:21:06,545 --> 01:21:08,843
抱歉，怕赶不上舞会
Sorry, we're late for the ball

938
01:21:08,947 --> 01:21:11,643
别假仙了，迟到大王
Alice and the rabbit'll be
disappointed

939
01:21:11,716 --> 01:21:13,377
你也会讽刺了
Now you're being cynical

940
01:21:16,388 --> 01:21:17,412
你是谁？
Who are you?

941
01:21:17,522 --> 01:21:20,514
我是你的离职员工
I'm just an ex-employee...

942
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:23,219
我来讨你欠的薪水
who's come for his back pay

943
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:25,593
或者说来找你算帐
Or should I say payback?

944
01:21:29,434 --> 01:21:30,765
杀掉他
Kill him

945
01:21:49,955 --> 01:21:51,354
你上呀
Come on

946
01:22:13,445 --> 01:22:14,742
各位来宾
Ladies and gentlemen...

947
01:22:14,846 --> 01:22:16,871
现在起
I will be the host...

948
01:22:16,982 --> 01:22:18,973
由我来主持
for the rest of the evening

949
01:22:29,794 --> 01:22:32,228
拉开你的狗
Get your dog away from me

950
01:22:33,565 --> 01:22:35,590
它似乎和你心心相印
Sorry, he seems to be attracted to you

951
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:38,726
人呢？情况不大妙
Where's everyone?
Something's not kosher

952
01:22:38,837 --> 01:22:39,997
小心
- Exactly.
- Watch it!

953
01:22:40,271 --> 01:22:41,397
对不起
Sorry

954
01:22:41,506 --> 01:22:42,871
我必须把你锁在车内
I must lock you in

955
01:22:44,442 --> 01:22:46,603
打开无线电
Use the radio

956
01:22:46,711 --> 01:22:49,942
做什么？
请求支援呀
You know, call for back-up
or something

957
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:55,876
这很危险，你乖乖别动
This could be dangerous.
Stay here and be a good boy

958
01:22:57,022 --> 01:22:59,786
你老子我要去扁人
Daddy has to go kick some ass

959
01:23:04,562 --> 01:23:05,927
他嫌人生乏味
He's a dead man

960
01:23:06,031 --> 01:23:08,864
趴下
Down! Get down!

961
01:23:09,934 --> 01:23:12,732
我懂，轻一点
Take it easy, I got the point

962
01:23:24,482 --> 01:23:25,380
轰掉它！
Blow it!

963
01:23:33,491 --> 01:23:35,482
你卑鄙
Bastard

964
01:23:35,593 --> 01:23:37,083
怎么了，亲爱的？
What's the matter, darling?

965
01:23:37,362 --> 01:23:39,387
他们是你的大舞群
This is your big production number

966
01:23:39,497 --> 01:23:41,761
做秀就是为了
And you know it's important...

967
01:23:41,866 --> 01:23:44,300
“轰轰烈烈”地成名
to go out with a big bang

968
01:23:53,611 --> 01:23:54,976
查理，你怎么来了？
Why are you here?

969
01:23:55,046 --> 01:23:58,607
拿着枪，溜到后面去
Take this gun and start
sneaking people out the back

970
01:24:02,687 --> 01:24:03,881
退后
Step back

971
01:24:03,988 --> 01:24:07,446
你知道我是什么人？
你不退后就是死人
- Do you know who I am?
- A dead man if you don't step back

972
01:24:07,559 --> 01:24:09,459
你难道不尊重法律和命令吗？
What about some respect?

973
01:24:09,561 --> 01:24:12,359
你算什么流氓呀？
炸弹设定完毕
- What kind of thug are you?
- All set, Dorian

974
01:24:14,365 --> 01:24:15,992
好极了
That's it

975
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:19,437
再过十分钟
This party's over...

976
01:24:19,537 --> 01:24:21,437
舞会就完了
in 10 minutes

977
01:24:23,374 --> 01:24:25,467
在这一关键时刻
This is the moment when a man...

978
01:24:25,577 --> 01:24:27,772
男儿要展露本性
shows what he's really made of

979
01:24:29,114 --> 01:24:30,046
枪放下
Crap

980
01:24:30,148 --> 01:24:31,945
放下
Drop it

981
01:24:44,562 --> 01:24:46,029
真机灵
Smart dog

982
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:55,962
老板，有不速之客
Boss, look who decided to crash
the party

983
01:24:56,074 --> 01:24:58,440
多利安，你好吗？
How's it going?

984
01:24:58,543 --> 01:25:00,374
带过来！
Bring him up here!

985
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:03,708
多利安，等一下
Wait! No!

986
01:25:03,815 --> 01:25:07,444
没时间听你的临终请求
This is no time for last requests

987
01:25:07,552 --> 01:25:09,952
我只求一吻
But all I wanted was a kiss

988
01:25:10,054 --> 01:25:12,454
一个吻？
A kiss?

989
01:25:12,557 --> 01:25:14,491
只是一个吻...
Just one...

990
01:25:14,592 --> 01:25:16,583
最后的一吻
last kiss

991
01:25:16,694 --> 01:25:18,559
定时器关不掉呀
I can't shut it off

992
01:25:19,764 --> 01:25:22,198
有的是时间
There's always time...

993
01:25:23,835 --> 01:25:26,201
才一个吻而已
for one last kiss

994
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:33,507
要正牌的多利安来吻
From the real Dorian

995
01:25:34,712 --> 01:25:37,044
我所爱的那位
The one I used to love

996
01:25:38,149 --> 01:25:40,174
他的吻举世无双
Nobody ever kissed me
like Dorian Tyrel

997
01:25:41,319 --> 01:25:42,251
罗密欧呀
Romeo!

998
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,379
这儿快炸了
This place will blow!

999
01:25:44,455 --> 01:25:46,650
你给我等着！
Just wait!

1000
01:25:51,262 --> 01:25:53,196
我决定了
I've decided...

1001
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:03,837
我要让她含笑而终
to give her one last thrill

1002
01:26:14,752 --> 01:26:16,276
接住它！
Get it!

1003
01:26:33,404 --> 01:26:34,837
快跑，麦乐
Run, Milo!

1004
01:26:38,476 --> 01:26:41,070
史丹利，快呀
Stanley, hurry!

1005
01:26:41,179 --> 01:26:42,646
你安啦
Don't worry

1006
01:26:42,747 --> 01:26:44,544
已经没戏唱了
It's all over now

1007
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:56,492
抓住你了
Got you

1008
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:10,707
我要剥你的皮
I'll take you apart

1009
01:27:10,808 --> 01:27:15,142
用你的独眼享受胜利吧
I hope you can enjoy the victory
with one freaking eye!

1010
01:27:32,931 --> 01:27:34,660
狗儿乖乖
Good doggie

1011
01:27:34,766 --> 01:27:35,698
好狗儿
Good doggie

1012
01:27:55,553 --> 01:27:56,485
我赢了！
I'm winning!

1013
01:28:20,578 --> 01:28:21,636
我是洛基！
JACKPOT

1014
01:28:34,959 --> 01:28:36,927
我的老天呀！
Oh, my God!

1015
01:28:37,028 --> 01:28:39,292
它一定是新品种
This must be a new breed

1016
01:28:39,397 --> 01:28:40,762
别急
Easy, boy!

1017
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:45,725
好狗儿
Good boy!

1018
01:29:16,734 --> 01:29:18,531
你们又没打中吗？
Did you miss me?

1019
01:29:26,344 --> 01:29:27,368
打中了
I guess not!

1020
01:29:34,552 --> 01:29:37,817
你们快扪心自问：
Now, you have to ask yourself
one question:

1021
01:29:37,889 --> 01:29:40,483
“我的命够硬吗？”
"Do I feel Iucky?"

1022
01:29:40,591 --> 01:29:41,523
怎样呀？
Well...

1023
01:29:44,362 --> 01:29:45,829
痞子，你们的够硬吗？
do you...

1024
01:29:45,930 --> 01:29:47,625
（玩具枪）
punks?

1025
01:30:21,933 --> 01:30:25,300
这肉丸挺辣的
That's a spicy meatball

1026
01:30:33,077 --> 01:30:34,567
怎样呀？
How do?

1027
01:30:40,985 --> 01:30:43,545
这家伙狗命真长
This guy's incorrigible

1028
01:31:11,582 --> 01:31:13,675
你是很有两下子啦
You were good, kid, real good...

1029
01:31:13,784 --> 01:31:17,413
但只要有我
你就一边凉快
but as long as I'm around
you'll be second-best

1030
01:31:38,142 --> 01:31:40,167
手举起来！
Police! Hands up!

1031
01:31:41,646 --> 01:31:44,046
条子们，逮捕这些人！
Officers, arrest those men

1032
01:31:44,148 --> 01:31:46,776
指挥警察真神气
I've always wanted to say that

1033
01:31:49,854 --> 01:31:50,912
走
Come on

1034
01:31:52,056 --> 01:31:53,318
枪拿来
Give me that gun

1035
01:31:59,197 --> 01:32:02,257
他抢了我们的珠宝
He stole all our jewelry.
Take me to headquarters...

1036
01:32:02,366 --> 01:32:04,334
拦住他
Stop that man!

1037
01:32:07,371 --> 01:32:08,633
伊卜吉，我逮到你了
I've got you now

1038
01:32:08,706 --> 01:32:10,765
小心，死胖子
Watch it, Chunky!

1039
01:32:11,042 --> 01:32:13,806
真抱歉，条顿市长
你搞什么鸟龙？
- Mayor Tilton, I'm so--
- What's wrong with you?

1040
01:32:14,078 --> 01:32:15,636
他就是面具怪客
That man is The Mask

1041
01:32:15,746 --> 01:32:19,739
多利安才是
我亲眼看见
No. Dorian Tyrel was The Mask.
I saw it with my own eyes

1042
01:32:19,850 --> 01:32:22,080
他是我们的救星
This man here saved our lives

1043
01:32:22,186 --> 01:32:25,212
有我相助嘛
你真是英雄
- With a little help.
- You're a real hero

1044
01:32:26,123 --> 01:32:27,715
这没什么
It's nothing...

1045
01:32:27,825 --> 01:32:29,793
身为铁血美国男儿
any American with...

1046
01:32:30,061 --> 01:32:33,258
愿为社会贡献一切
balls of steel wouldn't do
for his community

1047
01:32:33,331 --> 01:32:35,424
麦乐，走
Come on

1048
01:32:37,702 --> 01:32:39,795
市长，你看到那只狗？
Mayor Tilton, did you see that dog?

1049
01:32:39,870 --> 01:32:42,771
你少去惹它
Leave the dog alone

1050
01:32:42,873 --> 01:32:45,569
明天一大早找我报到
I want you in my office
first thing tomorrow

1051
01:32:45,676 --> 01:32:48,736
是，大人
拍马屁没用啦
- Yes, Your Honor.
- That doesn't sound good at all

1052
01:32:48,846 --> 01:32:52,441
是没用，你说什么才有用？
No, it doesn't.
What would sound good to you?

1053
01:32:52,550 --> 01:32:54,745
吃早饭
闭嘴
- Breakfast.
- Shut up!

1054
01:33:14,372 --> 01:33:16,340
你确定要这样做？
Sure you know what you're doing?

1055
01:33:18,709 --> 01:33:20,574
我确定
I'm sure

1056
01:33:20,678 --> 01:33:22,646
那就动手吧
Then do what you must

1057
01:33:35,893 --> 01:33:38,157
你真的不会怀念他？
Sure you won't miss this guy?

1058
01:33:38,262 --> 01:33:41,527
他走了，就只剩下我
When he's gone, all that's left is me

1059
01:34:25,976 --> 01:34:28,137
甜到心坎里！
Smoking!
