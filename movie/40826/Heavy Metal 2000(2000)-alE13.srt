1
-00:00:04,500 --> -00:00:00,500
很久以前 阿肯人统治整个银河系

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,900
它们身后满是恐怖和疮痍

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,500
它们那可怕的力量之源

4
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:11,070
遗落在乌诺波里斯星球的密室中

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,450
其中蕴含着神秘的永生之泉

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,920
密室只能被一把独一无二的钥匙打开

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,290
一旦被人找到

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:31,050
它将会引导发现者得到永生之泉

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,430
然而 那把钥匙令所有接触到它的人变得疯狂

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,770
阿肯人最终被击败 他们的力量之源被锁在密室中的时候

11
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,110
那把钥匙也被流放到宇宙深处

12
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,400
再也没有出现过

13
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,320
直到现在

14
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,920
哼 快点投降 你这混蛋

15
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,170
可恶 又来了

16
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,720
我已经等不及拿到那些新设备了

17
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,260
我已经受够了这些便宜货了

18
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,030
泰勒 我好像发现了什么

19
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,450
什么东西?

20
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,270
我也不知道

21
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,570
小心点 这可能是四级生化物品

22
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,810
这到底是什么?

23
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,860
它在做什么?

24
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,010
真是诡异

25
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,310
怎么回事?你还好吧？

26
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,650
需要我呼叫紧急救助吗?

27
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:23,650
不 不要 求求你

28
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,200
你在干什么

29
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,360
守护者已经显灵

30
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,240
钥匙已经被发现了

31
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,830
奥丁 告诉我们

32
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,500
巨大的黑暗是否即将到来?

33
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
是的 正如古书说记载的那样

34
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,000
黑暗即将回归

35
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
邪恶即将到来

36
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,000
我们必须做好准备守护密室

37
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,650
桑达斯  3号区域

38
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,030
我们还在等待当地核心的初步分析结果

39
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,090
什么？他们下去多久了？

40
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,660
超过12个小时 他们肯定快疯了

41
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:56,080
真奇怪  系统没问他 但一直没有回复  怪事

42
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,800
送几个人下去 我要弄清楚到底发生什么事情

43
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,970
我需要一艘大船去些地方

44
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,220
见鬼 你知道你在做什么吗

45
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,970
保安 到舰桥来

46
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,480
还有其他蠢问题吗?

47
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:26,240

导航定位至 BR-549 区域7

53
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,550
另外 来人把这些垃圾弄走

54
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,510
另外

55
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,480
你有20秒时间带我们离开这里

56
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,630
Hi

57
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,470
你还在这里干啥?

58
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,090
我知道  我一会就会上学迟到

59
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,550
爸爸在哪儿?

60
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,770
他在议会 我以为你也应该去的

61
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:03,670
哦 糟糕

62
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,990
你相信那些所谓的不朽的妄言吗?

63
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,160
想想看 一把愚蠢的钥匙?

64
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,120
他是个骗子 瞧着吧

65
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,790
听我说 这家伙自从那天开始就变得越来越诡异了

66
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:33,800
想想看再来10年? 见鬼  甚至100年

67
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,670
你说到点子上了

68
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,760
我讨厌这鬼地方 特别是翻遍这个丑陋的地方
I am getting sick of it Going all over the bloody place

69
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,510
寻找一个荒谬的谎言
Looking for a stupid compound

70
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,770
-你找到了什么东西？-一个FAKK2号行星
- What have you got?  - A FAKK 2 planet  sir

71
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,520
嗯 这地方对碳基生命来说意味着死亡
Death to all carbon based life forms

议会指定的二级杀戮死亡地带

74
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,660
对它进行扫描

75
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,540
我不明白
I don't get it

76
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,960
这外面有生命存在
There's life out there

77
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,080
这个FAKK2号行星的注册信息肯定过时了
The FAKK 2 must have been from an old registry

78
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,840
我想要这个地方H2O-471化合物的生物扫描结果
I want a bio-scan for compound H2O-471

79
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,560
他们的生态系统里一定有什么线索
There are small traces in their systems

80
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,480
到处都有不朽的线索
Yeah  Immortality all over the place

81
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,480
你
You

82
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,440
记着你的小命还不是不朽的
Just remember you're not immortal yet

可怜的小家伙 你只能靠你自己了

我需要的东西就在你们体内
What I need is in your system

118
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,240
虽然不足以另你们不朽
Not enough to make you immortal

119
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,540
但是足以令你们保持美丽和健康 特别是你

124
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,020
把她清理干净
Clean her up

125
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,980
相信不用我强调
And I don't have to remind your kind

126
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,190
她是我的
she's mine

127
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,760
我应该成为一个厨师的
I should have been a cook

128
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:08,010
尝尝这个
Try this for an appetiser

129
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:11,520
-我没做任何坏事  -你是他们一伙的
- I didn't do anything  I swear  - You're one of them

130
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,020

No  I mean  I was  but I ran away I didn't kill anybody

131
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,440
这到底是谁干的？
Who did this?

132
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,110
他抢了我们的船然后逼我们来这儿
He took over our ship and forced us to come here

133
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,230
-谁 ？ -他的名字叫泰勒
- Who? - His name's Tyler

134
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,570
为什么他要袭击我们？
Why did he attack?

135
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:25,450
他是个疯子 他想得到永生
He's nuts He thinks he's going to live forever

136
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:29,580
他要去哪里？你有一秒时间回答

140
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:44,380
-修好这艘飞船需要多久？-2小时 最多 我马上就要完工了
- How long to fix this Spacehawk?- Two hours  max  I'm almost there

141
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,970
你把你的扳手丢了 难道你不应该去捡起来吗？
You dropped your wrench Aren't you going to pick it up?

142
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:52,930
是的
Yeah

143
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,650
我又做了什么吗？
What did I do?

144
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,000
我是个天才
I am a genius

145
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,960
博士 这个最好奏效
Doc  this had better work

146
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,020
我喜欢这种淡淡的柠檬味
I like the hint of lemon

147
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,520
真令人开心
I'm so glad

148
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,820
是的
Yes

149
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,080
然后 我们要去哪儿？

I don't know dick  How does he do it?

227
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,770
他注射了一种奇怪的药

250
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,250
我们会一辈子困在那里
It'll take us forever to get back

251
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,420
一旦我们到达那里 这都将不再是问题
That won't be a problem once we get there

252
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,470
我们不可能成功 这就是一条死路
We'll never make it This thing's a death trap

253
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,430

- It's gotten us this far - This far is nowhere

254
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,970
在超空间航行就是在找死

你不能尾随他们的跳跃轨道
You can't just piggyback their jump

258
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:16,050
牵引光速 你疯了吗？我们会被扯碎的···
A tractor beam  Are you insane?We're going to rip to

259
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,370

See that blip? It's like somebody hitched onto our jump

That could change our trajectory I want them dead  Now  Take 'em down

00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,920
但是我从来没有听说过有人能够在超空间进行攻击
But I've never heard of anyone firing on a ship in hyperspace

264
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,880
你还有其他好主意吗？马上照我说的做

- We lost them all  They're toast - Send the bomber

00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:22,190
再多说一句话 我就送你去
One more word  and I'll send you

268
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:33,710
我们被击中了 我就知道
We're hit  I knew it

269
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,960
都怪你

270
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:43,840
赶紧做点什么
Do something

271
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,270
通道马上要崩溃了
The tunnel's breaking up

272
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,980
我们不可能成功的
We're not going to make it

273
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,660
好 来吧
Yes  Do it

274
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,820
我感应到那把钥匙就在附近
I sense the key is here

275
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:54,830
现在 最好由我和齐克先独自弄明白威胁的情况
For the moment  it is best if Zeek and I assess the threat alone

276
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,420
我的药
My ampoules

277
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,890
恐怕要轮到你了
I'm afraid it's down to you

278
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,970
不要 求求你

别担心 我没事
Don't worry  I'm fine

282
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,790
是么？你以为我关心这个吗？
Yeah? Like I give a shit

283
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,340
现在我们的武器储备还有多少？
What's the status on the double D-40s and munitions?

284
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,420
全部都在
We found a wheel

285
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,760
人员状况？
Personnel?

286
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:17,800
有78%死亡或失踪
Seventy-eight percent dead or missing

287
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:19,180
生命迹象扫描呢？
Life-scan?

288
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:25,480
这里有小镇 好像在北方10-12英里远处
There's a town  looks like it's about 10 or 12 miles north of here

289
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,400
飞行状态？
Flight status?

290
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,780
你是在开玩笑吧
You've got to be kidding

291
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,530
拿起武器 让那些殿后的人···
Gather the weapons what's left of my men

292
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:34,910
杀掉那些受伤无法战斗的 我们马上出发
shoot the injured  We're moving on

293
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:06,520
现在还觉得爽吗？
Was it good for you?

294
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,820
从现在开始我要对你这样做
I'll start you off like this

295
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:16,200
接下来的三四天里 我得依靠你来制造药剂了
The next step  in three or four days depending on your production

296
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,870
你就像一个药物合成储罐一样
will be the body tank

297
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,410
你丫疯子
You're sick

298
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:25,790
我是个疯狂的天才
I'm a sick genius

299
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,130
我不能呼吸了
I can't breathe

300
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:22,930
离我远点
Get off my face

301
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:27,430
你是什么东西？
What are you?

302
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:29,930
我是齐克 你是谁？
I'm Zeek  what are you?

303
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,770
你的身体真是柔软
You're so soft

304
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,690
我比你想象中的要强 石头人
I'm harder than you think  stone man

305
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:42,650
你绝对不能碰我的主人奥丁的所有物
Please  you must not touch my master Odin's property

306
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,820
他命我来看守这个
He's left me with the responsibility to guard it

307
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,290
轻松点 我对你看守的东西没兴趣 你的主人在哪里？
Relax  your thing is safe with me Where is your master?

308
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:51,700
我就是奥丁
I am Odin

309
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:56,540
请原谅我的小兄弟 他对于自己的职责非常认真
Please excuse my little friend he takes his duties very seriously

310
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:59,880
-你的名字是？-FAKK 朱莉
- What are you called?- FAKK Julie

311
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:05,590
朱莉 好柔软 非常柔软
Julie  soft  Very soft

312
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,600
你并不是我们这个世界的人吧？
You're not from our world  are you?

313
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:11,180
不清楚 这是哪里？
Hardly  What is this place?

314
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,730
乌诺波诺斯 有人称这里家 也有人说这里是地狱
Uroboris  Some call it home Others call it hell

315
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:18,560
我的主人说你们从天上来
My master says you come from the sky

316
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:21,400
你手上有那东西吗？你有那把钥匙吗？
Do you have it? Do you have the key?

317
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,990
我不知道什么钥匙？
I don't know anything about a key

318
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:26,820
我追到这里来是为了杀掉一个疯子 他能够死而复生
I crashed here trying to kill a madman who won't die

319
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,740
我确实看到两个火球
I did see two fireballs

320
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:33,080
另一个火球坠落到山塔尔城市方向
The other was headed in the direction of a city called Shantaar

321
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,830
离这里不远 我们带你过去
It's not far from here  We'll take you there

322
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,210
嗯嗯 和我们一起走吧
So please  come with us

323
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:43,920
和我讲讲那个疯子的事情
Tell me more about this madman

324
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,800
他叫泰勒 他将我所有关心的人都杀掉了
Bastard named Tyler killed everyone I ever cared about

325
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:53,810
我们的传说里提到拥有钥匙的人都会变得疯狂
Our legends say that whoever carries the key  becomes insane

326
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:56,730
那肯定就是他
That's him all right

327
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,320
我很抱歉 我能感觉到你的悲伤
I'm sorry  I sense your sadness

328
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:04,530
你的族群只剩下你一个人一定非常难受
It's hard to be the last of your people

329
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:15,510
没几个像样的 不过总算是个开始
Not much of an army  But it's a start

330
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:20,140
看 最丑的那个家伙好像坐在我的位子上
Look  The ugliest one seems to be sitting in my chair

331
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:48,300
喂 最丑的家伙
Hey  you  ugly

332
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,890
你的母亲是下贱的赫克特人
Your mother is a Hectarian whore's handbag

333
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,590
熔岩？我们要跨过这个吗？
Molten lava? We have to cross this?

334
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:35,180
是的 山塔特 在另一边
Yes  Shantaar lies on the other side

335
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:40,520
-我讨厌这地方 -我们怎么过去？
- I hate this place - How are we going to cross?

336
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:48,400
我是查拖格 红河的守护者
I am Chartog  guardian of the Red River

337
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:50,480
我知道怎么过去
I know the way across

338
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:53,610
我会告诉你
and I will tell you

339
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,990
你只需要
You just have to

340
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:00,080
亲我一下
kiss me

341
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:01,790
没门
No way

342
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:05,750
怎么呐？宝贝
What's the matter  my precious?

343
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:10,500
你没发现我的巨大魅力吗？
Don't you find me attractive?

344
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:15,180
如果这是杀掉泰勒所必须付出的代价的话···
If this is what it takes to kill Tyler

345
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:20,350
这才像话 帮帮你的朋友
That's a good girl  Help your friends

346
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:23,270
很快的
It will be over soon

347
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,650
那我返回得亲谁？
Who will I have to kiss to get back?

348
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:39,370
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

349
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:42,200
我们都在等你
We're waiting for you

350
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:46,960
混蛋 亲这个去吧
Son of a bitch  Kiss this

351
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:54,090
你们这些人的风俗真奇怪
Your people have strange customs

352
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:58,010
随你怎么说
Tell me about it

353
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:26,660
像是死亡呀 永生什么的
Mortality sucks  immortality sucks

354
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,920
所有这些鬼东西
Everything sucks

355
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,090
哦 见鬼
Oh  shit

356
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:37,510
这真是搓
This really sucks

357
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:14,670
那家伙是你寻找的人吗？
Is he the one you search for?

358
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:17,300
哦 是的
Oh  yeah

359
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:26,930
哈 上呀 泰勒
Yeah  Come on  Tyler

360
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,120
我是你的新头头 是我
I'm your new leader  Me

361
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:54,500
现在我们惨了
Now we're up the creek

362
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,520
当你杀掉某人时
When you kill someone

363
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,940
确保他已经死透了
make sure they're dead

364
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:21,820
哟 宝贝
Yo  baby

365
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:38,340
我是泰勒 你的新主人
I am Tyler  Your new lord

366
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:54,100
盲目的欢呼声真令人陶醉
Blind adulation makes me so horny

367
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:56,690
给我个女人
Bring me a wench

368
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:07,780
主人 他就是那个持有钥匙的人 不是吗？
Master  he's the one with the key  isn't he?

369
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:12,660
恐怕就凭我们的力量对付不了他
He's far too powerful for us to deal with alone

370
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:14,160
让我来
Leave that to me

371
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:19,040
朱莉 你太冲动了 三思而行呐
Julie  you are too impulsive Please  think about this

372
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:21,880
-考虑什么东西？-那把钥匙
- Think about what?- The key

373
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:26,260
-你不明白 -你担心的是那把钥匙
- You don't understand - You worry about the key

374
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:28,260
泰勒是我的
Tyler's mine

375
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:35,060
她心里只剩下对复仇的渴望
She is letting her thirst for revenge rule her mind

376
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,220
一个新造型 但是··
A little retro  but hey

377
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,350
他们在哪里发现你的？
Where'd they find you?

378
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:25,400
我听说你很特别 所以不辞万里来见你
I hear you're very special I've come a long way to meet you

379
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:34,540
-你不是机器人吧？-为什么你不自己来试试？
- You're not a robot  are you?- Why don't you find out for yourself?

380
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:38,250
我想我死了 并且去了天堂
I could say I've died and gone to heaven  but

381
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,880
那不可能
that wouldn't be true

382
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:45,050
哪部分？死掉抑或是去天堂？
Which part  the dying or the heaven?

383
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:49,130
你
You

384
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:57,600
我知道我的魅力无人可挡 你到底想要什么呢？
I know I'm irresistible but what do you want?

385
00:54:57,890 --> 00:54:59,690
我要你
I want you

386
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,650
还有你拥有的一切
and what you have

387
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:05,690
我拥有获得永生的钥匙
There's a price to pay for immortality

388
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:08,700
宇宙也即将付出迎来变革
and the universe is going to pick up the tab

389
00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:11,450
多么具有独创性
How original

390
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:14,330
每个国王都必须有一个皇后
Every king must have a queen

391
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:17,370
你想要我？
Do you want me?

392
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:20,080
你不妨大胆猜一猜
Take a wild guess

393
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,170
永远？
Forever?

394
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,300
闭嘴
Shut up

395
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:40,980
这次不行
Not this time

396
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,520
贱人
Bitch

397
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:46,690
去死吧
Time to die

398
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:53,450
死吧
Die

399
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:00,960
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

400
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:06,130
-停下 -我做不到 这是主人命令
- Stop - I can't  The master told me

401
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:10,760
你这个蠢石头
You stupid rock

402
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:24,480
我怎么可能会死在这里？
What does it take to get laid around here?

403
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:29,030
我抓到他了 就在刚才 我明明马上就能杀掉他的
I had him  Ten more seconds and he was dead

404
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:31,700
我们认为你陷入困境了
We thought you were in trouble

405
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:34,950
朱莉 太晚了
Julie  it's too late

406
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:38,080
这已经不再仅仅是你和泰勒之间的事情了
It's not just about you and Tyler

407
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:42,790
泰勒寻找的东西就藏在圣域
What Tyler seeks lies within the walls of the Holylands

408
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:48,050
他会到来并审判我们
He will come and we will all be judged

409
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:52,470
你说你没找到他们是什么意思？
What do you mean you can't find them?

410
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:57,720
你居然会跟丢一个6尺女人和一块会说话的石头？
How do you lose a 6-foot bitch with a talking rock?

411
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,270
你们是干嘛吃的？
How do you do that?

412
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:04,900
-我们到处都找遍了  -你们这帮蠢货
- We looked everywhere - You idiots

413
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:06,360
集合部队
Gather the troops

414
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,650
这就是？
This is it?

415
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:15,280
我相信得用点酒水和社会交际技巧来融入你们
I sure could use a drink and a little social give and take

416
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:19,700
主意不错
There goes that idea

417
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:40,560
能不能休息一会？我年纪有点大了
Can we stop for a moment?I'm not as young as I once was

418
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:43,060
我来查看周围的状况
I'll see what lies beyond

419
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:49,020
伊甸很美丽
Eden was beautiful

420
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:51,570
可是被他毁掉了
Then he destroyed it

421
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:54,360
主人 你过来看看
Master  come see

422
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:22,930
是时候进行下一阶段了
It's time for the next phase

423
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:27,020
求求你
Please

424
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:30,480
五分钟内 你将失去所有感觉
In five minutes  you will lose all senses

425
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:36,650
你就好像安静地死去了一样
It will seem like a very peaceful dying

426
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,070
什么？我们来了不速之客
What? We have company

427
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,460
你喜欢这样吗？
Do you like this?

428
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,720
你不应该那样做的
You shouldn't have done that

429
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:02,410
现在我很伤心
Now I'm really upset

430
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:10,330
我很担心 主人  朱莉进去有好一会了
I am worried  Master The soft one has been inside too long

431
01:00:12,370 --> 01:00:14,960
这儿 小家伙
Here  kitty

432
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:18,300
我知道你在哪儿
I know where you are

433
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:21,050
我能闻到你
I can smell you

434
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:29,020
救命
Help me

435
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:37,690
-凯瑞 其他人呢？-他们都死了
- Kerrie  what about the others?- They're all dead

436
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:40,990
抓住我
Hang on to me

437
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:47,780
没事
It's okay

438
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:50,870
就在这附近
Nearly there

439
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:57,790
快跑
Hurry  run

440
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,280
那不是我们坠毁的地方吗？
Isn't that where we crashed?

441
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:29,080
我的药剂
My ampoules

442
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:42,340
我会带上这把斧头然后找到那个贱人
I've had it up to here with that bitch

443
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:47,890
当我找到她 我会让她不朽 这样我就可以不断折磨她 杀死她
When I find her  I'll make her immortal so I can screw her and kill her

444
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:51,970
每天 每个小时 来娱乐自己
every hour of every day for all eternity

445
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:54,560
我们现在向圣域前进
We march on the Holyland now

446
01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:05,490
钥匙所到之处 恐惧如影随形
Where the key goes  horror follows

447
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:08,200
一切都将臣服于永生之下
All in the sacred name of immortality

448
01:02:09,370 --> 01:02:10,490
为什么是我们？
Why us?

449
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:13,950
难道你们那本古书没教你们关于阿肯人的事情？
Do your ancient books not teach you about the Arakacians?

450
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,790
我们没有古书
We have no ancient books

451
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,880
阿肯人被毁灭了 因此我们才能生活在和平中
They were destroyed so our people could live in peace

452
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,170
同时也失去了关于过去那些邪恶之事的记忆
without the memory of past evil

453
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:26,220
忘记历史只会令邪恶东山再起 朱莉
To forget history is to allow evil to rise again  Julie

454
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,090
然后到来更多的罪恶和混乱
More sinister and ruthless than ever

455
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:32,560
-泰勒是阿肯人吗？    -他不是
- Is Tyler an Arakacian?- He is not

456
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:37,060
很多实际以前 阿肯人发现了古神之泪
Many centuries ago  the Arakacians discovered an ancient tear

457
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:40,770
在宇宙形成过程中所产生的所有造物之中
in the fabric of the universe from which flowed a liquid

458
01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:43,070
它能够赐予永生
capable of bestowing immortality

459
01:02:43,610 --> 01:02:47,900
他们奴役我的祖先强迫他们制造一个密室
They enslaved my ancestors and forced them to build a chamber

460
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:51,660
密室就在应许之地用来收藏那古神之泪
in the Holylands to contain this unnatural power

461
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:56,000
因此阿肯人才能实行残暴地统治 直到
And so it was that the Arakacians ruled in infamy until

462
01:02:56,040 --> 01:03:01,130
我的祖先锁住密室并将钥匙流放到宇宙深处
my people were able to lock the chamber and cast the key deep into space

463
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:06,340
没有赐予永生的古神之泪 阿肯人变得普通
Without their life-giving waters the Arakacians became mortal

464
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:09,760
我们最终打败他们
and we were finally able to defeat them

465
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:12,430
但是现在泰勒拥有钥匙
But now Tyler has the key

466
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:15,970
是的 那把钥匙能够带来永生的可能
Yes  The key which holds the promise of immortality

467
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:19,440
但是也会令他发疯
but also renders its bearer insane

468
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:21,440
就像诅咒一样
Such is the curse

469
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:25,610
可能永生？但他已经不可战胜了
The promise of immortality?He's already invincible

470
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:27,860
不 他还不是
No  He is not

471
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,410
那把钥匙将会指引他找到古神之泪
The key is guiding him to the everlasting waters

472
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:34,370
但是他还没有得到它
but he has yet to reach them

473
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:36,580
为什么他要摧毁伊甸？
Why did he have to destroy Eden?

474
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:39,790
阿肯人也曾经占领你们故乡
The Arakacians also occupied your colony

475
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:43,960
如同他们蹂躏宇宙其他地方时一样 他们在伊甸储藏了一些古神之泪
and stored some of the liquid there as they ravaged the universe

476
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:46,840
这么多年过去 古神之泪遍布伊甸
Over time it seeped into the earth

477
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,300
你的族人逐渐将它吸入自己的身体中
Your people absorbed traces of it into their systems

478
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:53,090
泰勒便从他们的身体中提取药剂
Which Tyler distilled from their bodies

479
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:56,890
但这并不以令他不朽
Not enough to render him immortal

480
01:03:56,930 --> 01:03:59,890
可也足够他得到力量到达密室
but now he has the strength to reach the chamber

481
01:03:59,930 --> 01:04:03,610
就因为他对力量的渴望便毁灭了我的族群
A whole people destroyed because of the lust for power of one man

482
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:08,070
这种事在以前也发生过 朱莉 并且以后也会重演
It has happened before  Julie It will happen again

483
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:10,610
但绝不会是泰勒
Not with Tyler

484
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:07,840
欢迎回来 奥丁长老
Welcome back  Master Odin

485
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:26,650
-奥丁 那把钥匙是不是已经来到这里了？-恐怕是的
- Odin  the key? ls it here?- I'm afraid so

486
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:29,110
如同我们所说 运输队伍
As we speak  the carrier

487
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:32,990
还有山塔特的渣滓们正在向我们的城市而来
and the vile scum of Shantaar descend upon our city

488
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:38,160
我们必须尽我们所能做好准备 我们要战斗直到死亡
We have done all we can to prepare We will fight to the death

489
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,270
你们认识？
You know each other?

490
01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:28,600
他在学校时打算救我
He tried to save me at the school

491
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:30,520
那没什么
It was nothing

492
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,650
你们在哪里认识的？
And where did you meet?

493
01:07:34,270 --> 01:07:35,530
我们是姐妹
We're sisters

494
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:37,990
姐妹？
Sisters

495
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:42,120
长老都被杀掉了 我们中一定有叛徒
The elders have been killed There's a traitor among us

496
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,530
警告其他人
Warn the others

497
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:47,250
就在这里
There it is

498
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:52,210
永生的密室 里面就是古神之泪
The Chamber of lmmortality that holds the everlasting waters

499
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,330
最后一个
The last one

500
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,950
大家准备战斗 上
Everybody fight  Come on

501
01:09:57,330 --> 01:09:58,920
越来越糟了
This is going to suck

502
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:11,160
傻瓜
You fool

503
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,870
那是我最后一个了
That was my last one

504
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:11,300
-谢谢你 软家伙   -不用谢
- Thank you  soft one - Anytime

505
01:12:29,690 --> 01:12:30,950
喂 混蛋
Hey  asshole

506
01:12:32,530 --> 01:12:33,660
又是你
You again

507
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:32,720
你想我了吗？
Did you miss me?

508
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:50,940
你总是伤害你爱的人
You always hurt the ones you love

509
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,610
像这样吗？
Like this?

510
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:06,870
保持这样子 我马上回来
Hold that pose  I'll be right back

511
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:37,660
这是我的 全都是我的
It's mine  It's all mine

512
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,760
来吧 贱人 你真的惹火我了
Bring it on  bitch You're really starting to piss me off

513
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:05,390
你没资格拿到圣水
You are not worthy of the Holy Waters

514
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:08,190
至少今天不行
Not today

515
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:36,800
记住今天是你的忌日
Remember this on your way to hell

516
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,180
FAKK 2
FAKK 2

517
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:47,020
这疯狂的事情马上就要结束了
The insanity has to end now

518
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:54,980
我们必须毁掉那把钥匙
We must destroy the key

519
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:58,320
或者不用
Perhaps not

520
01:16:03,410 --> 01:16:04,450
为什么？
Why?

521
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:10,370
因为我是阿肯人
Because I am Arakacian

522
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:14,000
我的演技骗过了那些令人恶心的圣域人
My charade fooled the insufferable Holylanders

523
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:16,170
还有那个愚蠢的石头
And even that little stone idiot

524
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:19,340
你难道真的认为一个普通人能够阻止我？
What makes you think a pathetic mortal could stop me?

525
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:56,250
你个蠢货
You fools

526
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:23,320
我必须完成我的使命
I must fulfil my destiny

527
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:48,800
-你应该如此  -齐克 我命令你
- You must - Zeek  I command you

528
01:17:58,690 --> 01:18:02,400
再见 软家伙 我永远不会忘记你
Good-bye  soft one  I'll never forget you

529
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:38,270
结束了
It's over

530
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:47,360
-让我来帮你    -哦 不会吧 他还活着
- Let me help you - Oh  no  He survived

531
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:49,570
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

532
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,870
你看我怎么样 你这个白痴？
What does it look like  you dickhead?

533
01:19:01,710 --> 01:19:05,340
永恒意味着长久的孤独
Eternity is a long time to spend alone

534
01:19:06,010 --> 01:19:07,880
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

535
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:12,100
这是不是意味着我们要变得不朽？
Does this mean we're all going to be immortal?

536
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:14,970
因为如果这是真的 你知道···
'Cause if that's true  you know

537
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:17,810
听我说 我要去四处转转很长一段时间
Listen  I'm going to be around for a long time

538
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:19,940
谁拿着钥匙？
Who took the key?

539
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,310
这是不是意味着我们现在是朋友？
Does this mean we're friends now?

540
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:25,320
因为我给你添了不少麻烦 所以···
'Cause I've been putting up with a lot of your crap  so

541
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:29,490
我认为现在是回报的时间了 来吧 你知道你是爱我的
l think it's payback time Come on  you know you love me

542
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:53,600
就这样 那把通往永生密室的钥匙
And so the key to the chamber of immortality

543
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:58,730
再次被流放到宇宙沉寂的深处
was once again cast out into the silent gulfs of space

544
01:20:00,350 --> 01:20:05,610
一个新的石像守护者看守着它对抗邪恶
with a new stone protector to guard it against evil
