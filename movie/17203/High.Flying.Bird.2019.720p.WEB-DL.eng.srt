1
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,020
[man] Does the NBA have a system in place

2
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,440
for dealing with rookies?

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,680
Yeah, we have... It's called RTP,
Rookie Transition Program, so, um,

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,650
mine was the year after.

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,850
Anybody that was drafted in 2011
or lockout class,

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,940
you'd probably do it the year following,

7
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,100
but when you're drafted,
you're with your team for a while,

8
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,690
you have a good four- or five-day period
where they bring you together in New York

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,230
and go over
the ins and outs of the league

10
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,480
and things to expect, but, no,
I think they do a good job

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,100
in trying to present everything
that's gonna be there

12
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,400
but there's nothing like the experience
and living it is still...

13
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,530
Someone telling me what I'd go through
and living it was two different worlds.

14
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,110
I tried to prepare
to the best of my ability, but...

15
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,180
it's a monster that I don't think
anybody can prepare for.

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,640
-[man] What you promise?
-[man 2] Ray, I ain't promise shit.

17
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,560
[Ray] You must've signed something.
You said he's calling, threatening.

18
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,940
-You must've promised something.
-[man 2] I came to you.

19
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,810
[Ray] Erick, I'm asking you about this.

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,110
[Erick] When the first negotiation failed
with the league and Players Association,

21
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,030
I said, "Let me hold something
to float me by."

22
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,570
-I came to you first.
-[Ray] I said it didn't look good.

23
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,280
[Erick] How many agents
give players money?

24
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,570
[Ray] There's precedence.
It's not protocol. Not during a lockout.

25
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,240
Last time this happened, folks went broke.

26
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,430
-[Erick] Who tryin' to be broke?
-[Ray] You still broke!

27
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,180
You ain't even in the league yet--

28
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,890
-[man 3] Everything okay?
-[Ray] Yeah. Check, please.

29
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,980
Uh, wait a second. Here you go.

30
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,180
So, what? Now you rushin' me off?

31
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,390
I am no longer having a good time.

32
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,680
Yeah, me and you both.

33
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,400
-He got yo' ass.
-Who?

34
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,350
You a owl now? You.

35
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,190
You just telling me this now,

36
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,560
jumping at me, Erick Scott,
when you got got.

37
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,520
That man ain't meet you by happenstance
at your homie's party six months ago.

38
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,980
He meant to rock up to whoever's
pre-season soiree was going down

39
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,100
and catch him a rookie.

40
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,900
And he caught the big fish, yeah.

41
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,270
-Come on, man.
-Oh, the number-one signer!

42
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,860
He got yo' ass.

43
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,990
Don't get me wrong. You helped.
Smilin'. What'd he say?

44
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,360
"Big fan. Saw all your games at LSU."

45
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,610
Couldn't wait for you to sign to New York,
wouldn't have to travel to you?

46
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,320
Gave a nerdy laugh,
made you think he was a cornball?

47
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,570
-Damn.
-Mm-hmm.

48
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,520
See, he heard about the trouble.
Meetings happening and no resolution.

49
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,860
Everybody expecting something to come down
to the wire, as always,

50
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,690
and the owners or players to fold,
but if they didn't...

51
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,650
"Wonder how people are gonna survive."

52
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,520
He scared you, describing how a lockout
doesn't affect the Stephs and Durants.

53
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,780
"They got that long money.

54
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,070
It'll take a minute
before it affect their daily life.

55
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,070
But those check-to-check fellas
just starting out, the rookies..."

56
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,070
-He said... He used the term "freshmen."
-Mm-hmm.

57
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,740
He saw you panic and offered you
some dumb interest loan from his bank.

58
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,980
You should have asked yourself then,

59
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,110
"What's his angle?
Why is he being so damn generous to me?"

60
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,060
Then you should have said,
"Hey, man, I'm doing all right.

61
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,690
My agent, who isn't being paid
during the lockout,

62
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,890
told me don't take a loan
unless I can pay for it."

63
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,850
At which point, I'd have said,
I being you in this case...

64
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,940
"That's stupid."

65
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,640
That's right, Erick. "That's stupid."

66
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,810
It wouldn't be a loan
if I could pay it back then.

67
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,940
-See that logic? Don't take loans.
-I needed money.

68
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,430
For the fuck what?!

69
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,810
You had money to move here.
You moved here. Your rent is paid.

70
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,610
Now I'm shouting.

71
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:27,400
-Look, Ray, I'm sorry--
-Hey, E, spare me your apologies, okay?

72
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,440
This isn't Sister Ray's Prep Academy
where you do something stupid,

73
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,520
I rap your knuckles,
tell you to say the rosary

74
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,530
and all is forgiven.
You just being you.

75
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,810
What?

76
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,310
Here's what you thought
signing to the NBA would be.

77
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,690
Not a chance to show your talent,
not as a vehicle to a better world

78
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,100
or to change how the game is played
by pushing your limits,

79
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,740
your team's limits
into athletic glory. No.

80
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,780
You thought, "I can't wait to sign
that contract and stunt on these fools.

81
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,060
It'll be a big 'fuck you' to the naysayers
and the hate swayers.

82
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,150
Just wait till I swag out,
finally get Moms a new spot

83
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,600
and use Ray as the daddy I never met."

84
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,850
But signed or not, we are in a lockout.

85
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,440
Time for you to get
that daddy's dream dick out your mouth.

86
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,680
-Yo, pause, bro.
-Or after you made that stupid decision,

87
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,480
you could've told Joe Blow loan shark,
"Thanks, man.

88
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,310
Yeah, I got your money,
I spent it on some dumb shit.

89
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,740
I know it was a six-month,
very short-term loan

90
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,560
with very stupid, dumb-ass interest,
but I thought I'd be playing by now.

91
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,530
I'm not, so I don't got money
to pay you back.

92
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,030
Fuck you, have a nice life."

93
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,940
What's the worst he could do?
Give you bad credit?

94
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,180
-I already got--
-Rhetorical.

95
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,430
Right.

96
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,640
[sighs] My point, Erick, is...

97
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,900
he can't do shit else.

98
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,740
He's gon' call non-stop,
maybe send a summons,

99
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,600
but you're stressing
like he can schedule a drive-by.

100
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,990
-You wrong.
-On what? Climate change?

101
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,270
I didn't come to the league
to say fuck you to nobody.

102
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,820
-I was made for the league.
-The league is a business.

103
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,780
-It's all business?
-Yes, Erick, business.

104
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,900
-[Erick sighs]
-We are in business. Hey!

105
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,320
You want to get back on the court
and I want to get you there.

106
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,940
But right now, we have to wait, okay?

107
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,520
You can do that.
Or I don't know, man, practice.

108
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,820
Still got your pregame ritual down?

109
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,650
-No sex before a game.
-I'll assume you practicing.

110
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,390
Listen.

111
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,890
You think these fools,
these rich white dudes

112
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,350
gon' let the sexiest sport
fall by the wayside?

113
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,110
[Ray] I mean, football is fun,
but it don't sell sneakers.

114
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:30,360
You can't see the players half the time.
Baseball... is a whole lot of tradition,

115
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,270
but in order to move merch
and inspire rap lyrics,

116
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,030
they need your services.

117
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,690
Too much money at stake.

118
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,890
So, just chill the fuck out.

119
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,680
Wait on the Lord, Job.

120
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,350
Who?

121
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,030
Man, did they ever let you
go to class at LSU?

122
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,940
Yo, stop low-key stupiding me.

123
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,190
My apologies.

124
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,180
When I'm hungry, I get mean.

Hmm.

-This money?
-A bible.

Bible? We finna pray?

128
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,820
Not the Bible, a bible,
and don't open it now. Excuse me.

129
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,360
Ray, the card's denied.

130
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,190
We tried it a few times and called.
They said to cut it.

131
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,730
Here. I have cash.

132
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:20,810

133
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,440
You right.

134
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,310
I got caught in a bad position,
I got taken advantage of, I know.

135
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,820
I just want the game. That's what I know.

136
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,740
That's what I want.

137

We'll get it for you, I promise. But...

Nah, I'm up the block. I'm good.

-Oh, urgent isn't an emotion.
-I'm aware.

Listen, I'm sure Starr has a good reason
for moving you.

It's temporary.

Uh, the point is, Ray,
we can only take on so much weight.

But you're not taking on any weight.

Most of our clients are basketball.

Why would you want to rep hockey?

Please don't put me in the category
with everybody else.

Right, 'cause your blood is in the game.
You care about the game.

You think this is personal?

No, but it's bad news.

It's my commission.

305
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,490
[sighs] They aren't built for change.

306
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,930
None of 'em.

307
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,820
The owners, the Players Association...
The firm is just a siphon.

308
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,400
The smallest shift in the system,
everything gets fucked up.

309
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,150
Player gets hurt, his life is fucked.

310
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,850
Team owner says "Negroes," his life is...

311
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,740
Well, annoying, but more effectively,
his players get fucked.

312
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,020
City can't afford to house its home team,
Brooklyn gets fucked.

313
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,530
-Brooklyn gets fucked.
-I'm sitting,

314
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,530
looking Starr in his face, he's acting
like the life of that company

315
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,360
is gon' be worse off than some
of these players about to go back to...

316
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,440
-Ray...
-I'm just saying, man.

317
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,560
You care all the way
or you don't care at all, man.

318
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,400
Getting ready to preach?

319
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,310
They snatching 'em out the womb, like...

320
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,150
-You preachin'?
-Cats your boys' age,

321
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,980
they hungry to get them out there.

322
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,190
Ain't even really finished high school yet
but they won't explain 37% tax.

323
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,110
-They won't explain agency fees.
-Hmm.

324
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,270
Look,

325
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,030
there's a reason why
the NBA started integrating

326
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:16,520
as the Harlem Globetrotters exhibitions
started goin' international.

327
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,140
Control.

328
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:23,190
They wanted the control of a game
that we play, we played better.

329
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,400
They invented a game... on top of a game.

330
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,940
[Ray] Hmm.

331
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,150
The question is...

332
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,180
what you gon' do?

333
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,490
You in or you out?

334
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,440
I'm not out.

335
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,810
I'm just outside.

336
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,180
But I'm about to pull up a chair.

337
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,780
Hey, man, you can't save 'em all, man.

338
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,400
Couldn't save Gavin.

339
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,480
[sneakers squeak, footsteps]

340
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,480
Hey, man, I gotta go.

341
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,520
-Back Court Day.
-Yeah, I am, I'm coming.

342
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:08,150
I'm gonna bring you an event...
you won't forget.

343
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,980
That's a promise.

344
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,230
Gotta go talk to Myra first.

345
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,560
Why?

346
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,600
Did they come to an agreement?

347
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,980
Ain't nothing but a modern-day auction--

348
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,430
Oh... [chuckles]

349
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,280
[sighs]

350
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,560
"I love the Lord...

351
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,640
and all His black peoples."

352
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,030
[Spence] Run!

353
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:45,110
I think the biggest rookie mistake
that you can make

354
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,190
is being satisfied with making it.

355
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,610
You know, the satisfic-- satisfaction
of making the NBA

356
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,240
is the night of the draft
when you get drafted,

357
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:58,480
the night after the draft or the day after
the draft I'll even give the rookies,

358
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,560
but there shouldn't be no satisfaction
when you get to work.

359
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,440
When you get to work,
you've already had the glory,

360
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,600
you've been patted on the back enough
about making it to the NBA.

361
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,780
It's time for work now.

362
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,030
Now you have to fight to keep your job
every single day,

363
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,850
and being satisfied with making it
and just running through the motions

364
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,280
is the biggest mistake
any rookies can make.

365
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,400
[knocking]

366
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,560
Hi, Myra!

367
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,820
-Yes?
-It's Sam.

368
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,190
Samantha. I'm Ray Burke's assistant.

369
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:45,100
Oh... Oh, yes! Didn't you just call me
to confirm the meeting with Ray?

370
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,610
Oh, yeah, same Sam.

371
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:49,530
Um... You think
I could get a ride with you?

372
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,900
He just... seems off.

373
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,110
When you say "off,"

374
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,740
are his eyes wide, like, open,
like a deer?

375
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:06,780
And his jaw is clenched as though
he's chewing on bad steak?

376
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,110
Um...

377
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,190
Wow, that's really specific, but yes.

378
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,140
That's not off.

379
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,600
That's in.

380
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:20,940
He's up to something.

381
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,020
Thanks for the heads-up.

382
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,240
-Wait. No, I'm sorry. I wasn't trying--
-No, it's too late now.

383
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,930
You done let it slip. [sniffs]

384
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,490
Don't worry, though.
Ray's "up to something" is usually good.

385
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,610
Like I said, he can see the business.

386
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,270
He's a few steps ahead. [chuckles]

387
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,270
When I first met Ray,
he was on a strategy.

388
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,320
I thought he was just trying
to curry favor

389
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,690
for his already then star-like cousin,
but he... the cousin had a secret.

390
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,900
Things like that were hard to hide,
even before social media blew up.

391
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,270
You know, no one knows this
and Ray, he'll deny it to this day,

392
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,570
but he kept trying to get Gavin
to get out ahead of it.

393
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:03,230
He kept telling him to use it,
you know, make it a part of the appeal,

394
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,730
a part of the whole package.

395
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,810
I mean, Gavin was one of the best.
[sighs]

396
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,310
And when you have
one of the best hiding something,

397
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,070
it either eats away at the game
or the person.

398
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,930
In this case, it was mostly the person.

399
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,240
Thank you, Myra,
for telling me all that you could.

400
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,270
Thank you for... trespassing.

401
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,560
I'm sorry.
But, you know, desperate times, right?

402
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,810
Hardly. Lady, you have a bright future.

403
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,740
Sure I didn't overstep
with that licensing suggestion?

404
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:36,850
-"Overstep"?
-Mm-hmm.

405
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,690
That's where we were headed
if this lockout hadn't happened.

406
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,020
-Come work for us. We could use--
-Ooh...

407
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,240
I don't like to be used.

408
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,390
[Myra] She beat you to the punch, Ray-Ray?

409
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:55,270
You know, I hate when people not my mama
call me Ray-Ray.

410
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,610
Is there more in the bowl, My-My?

411
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,440
We'll see. You're buying the rounds,
you're late.

412
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,140
I'm just asking for confirmation.
You want this over. Everybody does.

413
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,650
-Do it for the kids.
-What kids? You don't even have kids.

414
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,310
-To the future.
-[Myra scoffs]

415
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,520
[glasses clink]

416
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,390
-You still want 'em?
-What?

417
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,560
Do you still want kids?
You all still trying?

418
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,400
-Look, Ray, don't--
-I'm just asking.

419
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:19,810
[Myra sighs]

420
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,940
-You know we do.
-Hmm.

421
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,270
-We've tried.
-How's it going?

422
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,900
Oh, we running some tests.

423
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,400
Caroline was gonna have the baby, but...

424
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,270
now we're running some tests
to see if I can.

425
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,860
So, you gonna be needin' some time off.

426
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,770
-You are a shit.
-I'm just trying to figure--

427
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,610
My womb isn't blocking you, Ray.

428
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,360
I want this shit over too.

429
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,360
You just seem relaxed for a meeting
that doesn't seem to have good news

430
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,900
with a pool of,
what did you call 'em, horny sharks?

431
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:54,890
Maybe you need to go on leave early.
Maybe your head's not in the negotiation.

432
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,770
-Fuck you.
-So, like, Surrogate Ray? Uncle Ray?

433
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,820
The meeting is a formality.

434
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,360
-Nothing's changed, twat.
-So, why have it?

435
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,770
It's an up-or-down vote.
The owners aren't budging.

436
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,140
They like the 50/50 split on our revenue,
but the players don't

437
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,730
because they have to spread it out
amongst too many other players,

438
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,480
especially with the surge in income.

439
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,560
The meeting's just there as a formality,

440
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,740
just to say we met and tried
before the holiday weekend.

441
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,030
Even if I was trying to get pregnant,
it wouldn't happen before Tuesday.

442
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,020
So, my head is in the game, dick,

443
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:31,770
and the Players Association, which I rep,
has spoken

444
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,690
and they are not moving.

445
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:38,150
And the owners, well,
they don't even give a fuck.

446
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,680
Half of 'em won't even show.

447
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,600
-Hey...
-What?

448
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:43,930
Uh... [chuckles]

449
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,820
You need some coffee.

450
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,860
There's a spot right on the corner.

451
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
Trying to enjoy that burn while you can?

452
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:54,610
[Myra scoffs]

453
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,190
Man, I was never that girl!

454
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:01,570
Even in high school, I had friends
who couldn't wait to be moms.

455
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,270
But not me.

456
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,990
-Shit, and now--
-She wants them more than you.

457
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,100
-And I want her more than the world.
-Mm.

458
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,940
That's beautiful.

459
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,680
-[chuckles] Sounds like honey whiskey.
-"Heavy with mood."

460
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,780
I know... What is that? I know that.

461
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,650
-Ah, it's college lesbian music.
-[chuckles]

462
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,350
I knew you were one of us.

463
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,940
-Go home, Ray.
-Good, and--

464
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,520
-"And"? Ray, no--
-Advise everyone at the meeting

465
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,570
they shouldn't put off till tomorrow
what they can do today.

466
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,360
What are you even talking about?

467
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,890
-What are you up to?
-Doing my job, Myra.

468
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,390
I'd like to do my job.

469
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,560
It's a lockout, Ray.

470
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,110
Go home, hmm?

471
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:47,650
Tell 'em.

472
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,520
Just tell 'em.

473
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,820
I come from a family where we don't...
It's really three of us -

474
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,400
my mom, my sister, myself.

475
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,310
We don't really trust anybody.

476
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,740
For-- Rightfully so,
we don't trust anybody.

477
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:02,060
We just stay within ourselves.

478
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,440
And it's worked, you know,
for my whole life.

479
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,930
And we met with...

480
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,490
I wanna get this right,
maybe three agencies,

481
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:12,740
you know, and the agency I'm with now,
CAA, was the first meeting,

482
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:16,030
the longest meeting. I make jokes
all the time, it was, like, five hours,

483
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:20,360
but, um, it just felt like I was at home,
you know.

484
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,030
That's been the consistent-- constant--
consistent throughout my career,

485
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,900
you know,
Louisville felt like I was at home.

486
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,140
When I went to Brewster Academy
for high school, I felt at home,

487
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:32,060
like that home vibe
I can be comfortable with, you know?

488
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,650
[men laughing]

489
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,140
-Hey, good to see you.
-You too.

490
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,740
[elevator pings]

491
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,570
[doors close]

492
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:23,240
I'm the last person you want to be
trapped in the elevator with.

493
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:25,600
David.

494
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,810
I was giving you a hard time in there.

495
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,060
You can handle it.

496
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,820
I like that they send you
to represent the big boys.

497
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,850
"Boys"?

498
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,740
You headed someplace nice
this long weekend?

499
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,020
We don't have to talk.

500
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,810
I'm headed to Australia.
Not a moment too soon.

501
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,360
You're planning a weekend trip
to Australia?

502
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:54,140
Well, I guess I don't have to spend
just the weekend anymore, do I?

503
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,150
You weren't planning to be here.

504
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,770
Our youngest is dating a reef specialist,
wants us to meet him.

505
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,650
I think it'll be nice.

506
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:08,640
-You believe in family, don't you, Myra?
-Tch.

507
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,320
You should go somewhere nice with yours.

508
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,610
I'm supposed to be here
in case negotiations...

509
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:17,640
You know, the Players Association
could sue your ass.

510
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,610
For?

511
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,020
You weren't negotiating in good faith.

512
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,600
Neither were you.

513
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,480
-You don't seem surprised.
-I'm not.

514
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,860
-I got your address from the off--
-You're my assistant.

515
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,430
-Former.
-They wipe your memory or something?

516
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,980
I guess I'm just saying
you don't seem that upset.

517
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,440
I'm not.

518
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:55,810
I need you.

519
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,860
I'm glad you finally see that.

520
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,520
Okay, look, Sam...

521
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,820
you were a really great assistant, okay?

522
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,110
But please stop whining because
I didn't pay you special attention.

523
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,070
Now, I know there are people

524
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,740
who buy their personal assistants gifts
and whatnot,

525
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,810
but it's really because
they hate their assistants.

526
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,990
But they need 'em so they buy 'em things.

527
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:21,030
I told you you were indispensable,
now you want me to say sorry - for what?

528
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:23,320
Not remembering your birthday
or your last name?

529
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,150
I mean, what is this? Date two?

530
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:28,860
Well, thank you.

531
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,940
For what?

532
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,900
"Indispensable."

533
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,560
Tch. Ah...

534
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,060
[he sighs]

535
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,530
Don't thank me yet.

536
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,770
Come on, inside.

537
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,570
[Sam] You know I chose you.

538
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,650
-"Chose me"?
-Mmhmm.

539
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,480
I graduated top of my class

540
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,480
and I came in entry level,
so that I could work with you.

541
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,030
I knew you were a hard-ass

542
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:59,490
and everybody else knew you already
had old-man tendencies at almost 40.

543
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,520
-Hey, watch that "four word," lady.
-[chuckles]

544
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,860
Yeah, well...

545
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,230
you do it for the right reasons.

546
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,650
I know you'd never admit it,
but you lean into it and the work shows.

547
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,350
Yeah. Not lately.

548
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,860
Yeah, well, 'cause the problem is
we've run out of story.

549
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,860
"Story"?

550
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:24,820
What's the story here?

551
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,570
Remember that Paul Meghan thing?

552
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,320
When he was caught
publicly punishing his daughter

553
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,150
and everybody thought he was done?

554
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:36,110
But then you leaked that video
of him crying at his daughter's recital

555
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:38,990
and that changed everything
and that became the story?

556
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,810
We need to get at Erick Scott.

557
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,110
"Get at him"? You mean, like...

558
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,650
Wait, what? No!

559
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,070
What is wrong with you?

560
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,400
No. I'm talking about activate him.

561
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,390
Like... what story's gonna activate Erick?

562
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,110
We gotta get a game goin'.

563
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,730
[man over PA] Ladies and gentlemen,

564
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,640
our next station stop -
Philadelphia 30th Street Station.

565
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:11,770
If you're leaving us,
check you have all your belongings.

566
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,990
As you exit the train,

567
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,350
mind the gap between the train
and the station's platform.

568
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,570
Thank you for choosing our train.
Philadelphia 30th Street Station is next.

569
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,110
Have a pleasant afternoon.

570
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,740
[Ray] You have a lovely home.

571
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,570
Not what you were expecting?

572
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:31,570
Pardon?

573
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,100
When you walked up.

574
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,990
You stopped, looked around.

575
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,240
Guess you thought we were
one of those stories.

576
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,560
Boy has hoop dream,
mother pushes him to succeed

577
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,030
so he can buy her a house.

578
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,320
Oh, no, I didn't.

579
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:47,390
I already have a house.
Don't need a house.

580
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,390
-A very lovely one.
-Mm-hmm.

581
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,780
Ms. Umber--

582
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,690
Mrs.

583
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,270
Uh... Emera--

584
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,650
"Mrs" is fine. You believe in God?

585
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,690
Um... Well, I was raised Baptist.

586
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,980
But from whom do you draw your strength?

587
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,060
God?

588
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,060
You scared I'ma ask you to recite a verse?

589
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,180
-"Jesus wept."
-Oh...

590
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,140
Mmhmm. [chuckles]

591
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,110
Well, Mr. Burke, I believe in God.

592
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,110
And not the "He is everywhere"
Creator version in your mind.

593
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:26,110
The God who asks for obedience.

594
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:28,690
-Hey, hell is a place.
-Indeed!

595
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,780
And I intend my sons
to know heaven here,

596
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,030
in this world.

597
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:37,030
They have the opportunity
to do that right here.

598
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:40,610
They have the skill, the charm, the drive

599
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,990
to be the best in this world.

600
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:47,520
And they don't drink or smoke
or any of those other natural afflictions

601
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,110
-that can halt a man.
-Right.

602
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,490
And I think they should be
compensated for it.

603
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,390
Gospel of Prosperity! Amen!

604
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,860
But, again, it's not about me.

605
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,060
-I don't want their money. It's theirs.
-Oh, I hear you.

606
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,690
No, you don't.

607
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,810
If you did, you'd get up
and go on on from here.

608
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:11,060
Mrs. Umber, I want to speak with you
about an oppor--

609
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,690
About repping Jamero Umber.

610
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,680
[Ray] Uh... Yes, but in a different way.

611
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:19,020
I already manage Jayvier.

612
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,110
He's in the NFL,
since we're in a lockout--

613
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:24,280
Oh, please! I see old white men

614
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,610
and young hoteps trying
to rise up off my baby, same play.

615
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,730
I'm the manager. Agent.

616
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,110
All.

617
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,230
And you ought to be ashamed of yourself,

618
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,890
trying to cash in on somebody
during the lockout.

619
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,060
What?

620
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,990
Erick Scott ain't working out
like you thought, is he?

621
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,110
[chuckles]

622
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:51,770
Well...

623
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:56,230
you can't have a percent
of my baby's earnings.

624
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,930
I'm an old school accountant with Bell.

625
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,060
I know how to pay they taxes.

626
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,990
I want sweeping exclusive deals
that match their worth

627
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:10,190
and that can be jettisoned
if the brand becomes unfit.

628
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,810
I can negotiate that.

629
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,690
And if I can't, I have a lawyer that can

630
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,430
and he's paid by my
and my husband's trust.

631
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,730
So, Mr. Burke...

632
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,180
Ray...

633
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:22,940
we do not need you.

634
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:28,020
I appreciate you coming to Philly
to see me, though.

635
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:31,900
Gives me a great idea of what kind
of company the competition keeps.

636
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,280
Great.

637
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,150
Where you been?

638
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,140
-You smell like drink. I need a drink.
-[Ray] Philly.

639
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,600
-Philly?
-Yep.

640
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,810
And I'll tell you why
when you turn on your TV

641
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,990
and tell me that you've accepted
Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior.

642
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:54,430
-[laughs] What are you talkin' about?
-What happened with Seton?

643
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,810
God.

644
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,530
David Seton is the Lord Voldemort
of owners.

645
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,610
-Lord...?
-The Dark Lord.

646
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:02,610
Harry... Walder Frey.

647
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,070
-GOT I know.
-I'm sitting in this meeting yesterday

648
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,240
when I should be home, comforting my wife.

649
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,110
-We're still in the lockout?
-Fuck you.

650
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,690
-I'm just making sure.
-Yes. Yes, we are.

651
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,310
And I thought we would be.

652
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,780
I thought I was just dealing
with hard-ass businessmen

653
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,280
who didn't want to give their players
proportionate pay.

654
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,360
Fuck, that's what unions and businessmen
have been fighting for since--

655
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,280
Slavery?

656
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:28,230
-Yes!
-I love the Lord and all His black people.

657
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,020
What are you even saying?

658
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,520
I'm listening.

659
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,890
-We're being played, Ray.
-Yeah.

660
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:37,740
The owners galvanized by
that wet spot Seton from what I can tell.

661
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,680
They're holding onto this lockout

662
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,810
so they can renegotiate terms
with the networks.

663
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,520
-Those contracts expire.
-They expired last week.

664
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:46,360
-I know, I checked.
-Lawsuit?

665
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,940
For what?

666
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,270
I can't prove any of this shit.
I just know.

667
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,850
They'll probably settle with the networks
in a couple of weeks for bazillions

668
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,770
and then agree to some weak-ass form
of 0.5% increase

669
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,570
-every five years over 20 years and--
-So, it's a month.

670
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:05,140
-It's another month.
-In baby time, that's a lot.

671
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,890
-Don't start.
-A lot of guys not prepared

672
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,850
-for a full six-month strike.
-I know.

673
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,190
Players'll probably cave
before the network deal's done,

674
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,890
-the owners won't have to agree to shit.
-Fuck, I know.

675
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:15,610
We gotta stop 'em.

676
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,350
Why are you talking like that?

677
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,140
What are you looking at?

678
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
Turn it up.

679
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,890
[man] Oh, man, this is getting crazy!

680
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:32,560
Jamero Umber and Erick Scott
seem to be going at it in public,

681
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,570
calling each other out on Twitter.

682
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:38,610
You never wanna make these things public,
but these guys have,

683
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:41,490
taking issue with each other's lifestyles
and doing it all

684
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,350
-in a hundred-odd characters.
-Oh, no, Ray!

685
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,940
-What have you done?
-Seems Jamero's having problems...

686
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:50,810
Sometimes everyone bumps heads.
It's just like anyone at work, you know.

687
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,990
You may bump heads with your co-worker
from time to time,

688
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,680
but for me, as a teammate,

689
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:58,810
I always remind each other,
you know, all of us,

690
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,110
that we're teammates, you know,
we're family. We're in this together.

691
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,900
I'm not here not only...

692
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:07,810
I'm not here just to be here for myself,
I'm here to help everyone.

693
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,030
You know, I'd rather have somebody
talk about me to my face

694
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,530
rather than talk about me to--
behind my back

695
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:16,150
or sub-tweet and I have to guess
what you're trying to say

696
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:19,730
rather than we just air it out
and we figure it out amongst the family

697
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:23,020
and, you know, we're happy to go do it
in front of everybody else

698
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:25,440
and find a way to keep moving
in the right direction.

699
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,350
You're never off the clock.
That's one thing that I know.

700
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,900
You're always on the clock.
You could be at home, anywhere.

701
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,980
With the technology now,
anybody needs to pick up with a soundbite

702
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,560
and put your name behind it,
even if it's not true,

703
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,780
you make headlines,
so that's the one thing I learned.

704
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,610
[Erick] I don't know why that dude came
at me like that.

705
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,030
[Sam] Why? Are you scared?

706
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:49,980
Hell, no! It's just... Just whatever.
It's just some of that stuff ain't right.

707
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,520
Come on.

708
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:57,560
I'm deadass. If I got some shit to say,
I'ma say it straight to a nig-- a dude.

709
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:00,730
I'ma say it to a dude's face.
Don't need no tweets.

710
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,810
But everybody says that
then their shit goes viral,

711
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,070
then they're like,
"Oh, no, that wasn't me."

712
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,150
But it wasn't.

713
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,060
[laughs]

714
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,990
Okay. But is it true?

715
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,740
What?

716
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,610
Are you better than him?

717
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:17,610
You're both signed with New York,
both wanna play, but...

718
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:19,520
Are you better than Jamero?

719
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,440
Look, put it like this.

720
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,240
There's street ball
and there's organized ball.

721
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,730
Me and this cat's supposed to be
on the same team.

722
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,430
If it weren't for the lockout,
we'd be in training together, but...

723
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,390
He plays organized ball.

724
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:35,850
I'm from the streets.
I know iso, one-on-one.

725
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:39,770
Take the clock off, till 21,
I'll light his ass up any day.

726
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,280
[laughs]

727
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:46,930
-"Light... his... ass... up..."
-Whoa, girl, what you doin'?

728
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:50,430
-Whoa! I'm grown as fuck.
-Okay, lady, why you send that?

729
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,020
Because you said it's true!

730
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,860
You wanted Ray to help you
make a statement that was true

731
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,070
-and didn't sound confrontational.
-Ray. You're not Ray.

732
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,610
You're right.

733
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,740
And I don't work for him either.

734
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,150
Wait, since when?

735
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:08,310
Yo, Jamero's talkin' mad shit about you!

736
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,900
No, his mom was.

737
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,810
Yeah, but you can't say anything
about his mama, so...

738
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,740
Look, I was hacked earlier.

739
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,940
They was talkin' about how I was chillin'
and slackin' during the lockout

740
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,930
and they hope I be ready
if the game came back

741
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,560
'cause I'm just support for Jamero.
Like, tha fuck?

742
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:26,610
Yeah, you wrote that, too.
"Tha fuck?" [laughs]

743
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:28,940
That's me, that's how I talk. That was me.

744
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:33,820
Okay, so you didn't say,
"Get that wet nurse off your timeline"?

745
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,530
No, see, that's not how I talk.

746
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:37,650
That's corny,
I don't even know what that mean.

747
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:41,490
So, did it make you mad that they were,
like, "You're just the backup"?

748
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,820
-Yeah.
-"You're a bench player"?

749
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,110
I was heated 'bout that.

750
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:49,680
Oh, so you did say,
"Jamero so drunk off that mama's milk,

751
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,230
now he lookin' for a spanking
from his daddy."

752
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:55,520
No, see, but I'm startin' to wish I did.

753
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,190
Why didn't you?

754
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:00,020
-You scared?
-No.

755
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:01,680
Look...

756
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:05,990
like I said, I make the rim shake and move
with my fury.

757
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,440
Mm-kay!

758
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:14,180
"Shake and move with the fury...

759
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,600
of my discontent."

760
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,150
See, that's good.

761
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,930
-It's cute.
-There go Ray right there.

762
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,350
[horn honking]

763
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,150
[Sam] Hey!

764
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,440
-[Erick] But we had no choice.
-[Ray] "We"?

765
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:33,350
[Erick] I mean, Sam ain't really...
It was all me.

766
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:37,270
I did it, you know?
Fuck homes and his fam.

767
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,360
[Ray] That is your teammate, sir.
That will be your teammate.

768
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,610
You don't think the coach,
the team's management or David Seton

769
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,320
are gonna pay attention
to its star players bickering

770
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,030
before the game is even back on?

771
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,690
-[Erick] If the game ever get back on.
-What did I just tell you?

772
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,150
[Erick] Look, Ray, I'm sorry.

773
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,980
[Ray] That act's getting a bit tired,

774
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,430
especially since
it's not bringing in any money.

775
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,860
-[Erick] So you do worry about the money?
-[Ray] You funny. You funny, man.

776
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,650
You got bad press
without stepping foot on the court,

777
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:05,770
but you got jokes.

778
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,400
And you...

779
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:08,940
What?

780
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:11,530
He called to schedule an appointment.

781
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,400
Did you tell him
you're no longer my assistant?

782
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,930
Well, I was going to,
but when he told me why,

783
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,730
I figured you'd want
to have this discussion in person.

784
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,110
Listen,

785
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,560
all you had to do was say, "No comment."

786
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:27,190
Emera Umber's just tweeting
from her son's account,

787
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:29,180
trying to get you hyped. Just say no.

788
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,020
-Yo, Ray, this you and Gavin Burke?
-[Sam] Yeah.

789
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,600
[Ray] Thank you, Ray.

790
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,930
Isn't this the envelope I gave you?
Why are you carrying it around?

791
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:44,140
-Thought it might be a good time to open--
-[Ray] It's not. You'll know.

792
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,310
Okay. Yo, you used to rep buddy, right?

793
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,070
[Sam] Yeah, he was his first client.
He brought him to SAV.

794
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:51,490
-[Ray] Can we all just--
-[Sam] I'm right, right?

795
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,680
He was your brother?

796
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,150
[Ray] Cousin.

797
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,430
I never made that connection, fam.

798
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,520
Yo, buddy die, right?

799
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,280
Yes, Erick, he's dead. We good?

800
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,280
[Erick] My bad.

801
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,190
Was it hard?

802
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,360
[sighs] Man, what are you talking--

803
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:16,180
Let me check the temperature for you.
We have not heard from New York.

804
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:19,610
They haven't hit us up,
haven't said anything about the beef.

805
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:22,190
That's good, it gives us
a minute to recalibrate.

806
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:25,270
You did go down the rabbit hole
with Alice and the Dormouse,

807
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,070
but it's cool 'cause you back now.

808
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,650
So, let's put our heads together

809
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:30,770
and figure out how
we can get in front of this thing.

810
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:35,190
Who you calling?

811
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:38,150
It's time for you to go home.

812
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:47,110
[Myra] It's a free country still, I think,
or at least there's an illusion of one.

813
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,400
[Ray] That's your legal advice?

814
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,400
I'm headed home, Ray.

815
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:55,390
But yes. No, he's not scabbing

816
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,890
if he wants to shoot the ball around
with neighborhood kids

817
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,140
and take a couple questions
from the press about it.

818
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,780
Thank you, Myra.
Tell Caroline I said hello and--

819
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,150
I will.

820
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:06,400
Stop by the court if you get bored.

821
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,640
Thank you, but I won't get that bored.

822
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:13,810
Thanks.

823
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,810
You're welcome.
So, what you 'bout to do?

824
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,270
-Nothing.
-Wanna hang out?

825
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,430
Okay.

826
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,770
-[Erick] It's not.
-Yes, it is.

827
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,320
-You wouldn't know.
-I'd know.

828
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,780
[Donovan] Well, I think the first thing
is just being more efficient.

829
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:32,070
You know, it kinda goes back to being
that rookie that's all over the place.

830
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:34,320
There are moments where I felt
I was out of control,

831
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,820
shooting shots that are, like,
"What are you doing?"

832
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,320
But you're just out of control.

833
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,320
It's my first year
so I'm learning and making mistakes.

834
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,280
It's not as easy as it sounds.

835
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,940
You're not just given a boatload of money,
like the old-school cartoons.

836
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,680
You're not given a roomful of gold coins

837
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:51,100
and you get to dive off a diving board
and swim in it.

838
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:53,610
[Reggie] That's one thing I'll say -
90% mental.

839
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:55,940
Once you get to this level,
everybody has the talent.

840
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:59,480
It's really about unlocking your mental,
unlocking your confidence,

841
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,990
um, learning how to deal with your vices.

842
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,060
[whistle blows]

843
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:06,320
-[woman] You got it, girl. Come on.
-[woman 2] Keep going, guys.

844
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,610
[boy 1] She's open!

845
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:14,360
[boy 2] Come on,
you gotta find your light-skin light.

846
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,530
-[Ray] Wait, what?
-Your light-skin light.

847
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,940
You move around
until the light's in your eyes

848
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,600
and you gotta squint because it's windy -

849
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,640
that's how you know
you got your light-skin light.

850
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:24,980
And don't worry,
all the filters work on light-skin light.

851
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:28,850
And then all you've got to do is,
you know, act light-skin.

852
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,060
And how's that?

853
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,990
Like LL. Lick your lips.

854
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,570
-Quincy Brown pucker?
-What?

855
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,650
-Kardashian scowl.
-Chris Brown smirk.

856
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,480
What's dark-skin light?

857
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:40,930
[both] Eggplant Fridays!

858
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,680
-Come on, man!
-Get it together!

859
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,940
Darius. Freddy. Focus.

860
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,020
-Pay attention.
-We was just...

861
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:50,310
You don't own this court, Mr. Spence.

862
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:56,520
From the start of practice,

863
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:59,270
till y'all little Twitter asses go home,

864
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,180
I own you, son.

865
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,600
Wait, was that...

866
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:05,400
[all] A slavery reference?

867
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,060
[Ray] Where are you?

868
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,650
I don't work for you anymore.

869
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,310
[Ray] I know that. Why do you keep--
Look, is Erick with you or not?

870
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,820
Yes, he's right here.
Do you want to speak with him?

871
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:18,480
I'd like for y'all to be here.

872
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,730
I told Spence
you'd be here 30 minutes ago.

873
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:24,320
Okay, yeah, I know, but we had, like,
a wardrobe malfunction.

874
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,180
Please just get here.

875
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,070
All right, okay. Bye!

876
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:32,730
Jesus Christ!

877
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,140
So, who's gonna tell him?

878
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:37,440
I don't kiss and tell.

879
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:39,730
[chuckles] Seriously?

880
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,070
I'm deadass. This our business, right?

881
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,680
Ray don't need to know
what happened between us.

882
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,400
Okay, I guess you're right.

883
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,690
No reason to talk about it
if it's not gonna happen again, right?

884
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:52,600
Right.

885
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:54,180
Wait, what?

886
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,190
[Spence] Every year, we have this day

887
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:00,610
to celebrate or at least commemorate

888
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:04,810
those who balled before.

889
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:10,180
We bring our young players out and talk
to them about the game and how it started.

890
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:16,230
The reason there is a pro league is
because we had a league of our own before

891
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:20,180
that was good for us and our community.

892
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,520
We gave that up for...

893
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,640
more money.

894
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,270
So, like, today,

895
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:30,350
like you are doing,

896
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:33,400
my players don't usually listen to me.

897
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:36,350
But usually,

898
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:41,270
players from the major teams
come out to talk to our players

899
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,900
and sign autographs,
but since the lockout, I guess...

900
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,400
I'm guessing
that they're at home or in Florida,

901
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:53,070
where they claim properties for...

902
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,530
tax breaks.

903
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:57,860
But...

904
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:00,180
with us today,

905
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:05,310
to celebrate the street ball
that made him,

906
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:09,560
is the number-one draft pick,

907
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:11,890
Mr. Erick Scott.

908
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,900
[applause]

909
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,640
But before we hear from Erick,

910
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,310
I would like to call up...

911
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,100
his agent and friend,

912
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:31,440
Mr. Ray Burke.

913
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,930
-Ray, come on up.
-[applause]

914
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,060
Come on, Ray.

915
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:35,740
Come on, Ray.

916
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,810
You got this, brother.

917
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:41,690
You got it.

918
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,100
How y'all doing?

919
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,560
[kids] Good.

920
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:51,400
I said, how y'all doing?

921
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,850
-Good.
-All right. [chuckles]

922
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,280
Well, um...

923
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:01,280
Listen, y'all might notice that things
are a little different this year.

924
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:05,640
No cameras out here,
just a few journalists from the papers.

925
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:10,650
And since we got a little time...

926
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:16,060
and Spence asked me to say something
to the youth, I guess I'll speak on it.

927
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:17,390
Is that all right?

928
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,180
-[kids] Yeah.
-[Ray] Is that all right?

929
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:20,770
-[kids] Yeah!
-[Ray] All right.

930
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:21,900
[chuckles]

931
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:25,770
You know, I'm not from where y'all from.

932
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:29,070
This neighborhood's where most of y'all
come from, yeah?

933
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:30,780
-[kids] Yeah.
-Yeah.

934
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,180
Well, it didn't look like this
when I was your age.

935
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,980
It looked more like the town
that my people are from, my cousin..

936
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,350
is from.

937
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:48,680
You know, I used to, uh...

938
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,020
used to visit him every year
in Jacksonville.

939
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:56,030
And we would, you know,
do what cousins do -

940
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:59,110
play each other, dare each other
to get better every summer.

941
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,190
Now, I kept my part of the bargain.

942
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,690
He did too. See, his daddy helped him,
even though he never met him.

943
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,150
My cousin had a growth spurt one summer.

944
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,520
Yeah, man.

945
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:15,610
I went back down there
the summer before high school and...

946
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:19,560
Gavin had done shot up to six-six!

947
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,070
A mango season, they called it.

948
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:26,100
"All you need is a mango season
and everything'll change."

949
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,600
And it did.

950
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,350
Everybody was coming down there
to see him play.

951
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:37,730
Now, I guess this is the part where y'all
expecting me to say I was jealous.

952
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,730
Oh, I was.

953
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:43,350
But not of him.
I couldn't be jealous of that fool.

954
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,810
Nah, I was jealous of the cats
that got to play him.

955
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:53,490
Gavin loved...

956
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,640
loved this game.

957
00:47:57,770 --> 00:48:00,890
He was thankful to God for his height
and his talent and...

958
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:04,230
and then he lost all that.

959
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,980
He lost that love
and then he left the game.

960
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,030
He lost his life.

961
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,030
Y'all don't lose that love.

962
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:19,860
A'ight?

963
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:21,240
Even if yo'...

964
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,060
Even if yo' mango season ain't come,

965
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:26,690
won't come, passed,

966
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,570
hold onto that love.

967
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:32,230
It'll get you through.

968
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,810
[Ray clears throat] Um...

969
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:44,360
But I want to introduce you all
to somebody

970
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:47,430
who hasn't lost that love and never will.

971
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:50,020
And even though
there's a bunch of talk going around

972
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:52,610
about status on teams
and whatnot, fu-- Um...

973
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:55,230
[chuckling] Forget all that.

974
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,070
Ain't no teams right now.
So, put your hands together and give it up

975
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,570
for your Back Court king, Mr. Erick Scott!

976
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:05,110
[applause, cheering]

977
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,020
[boy] Woohoo!

978
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,440
[boy 2] All right!

979
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:12,740
So, your last year at LSU, did you know?

980
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:14,070
You never know.

981
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:15,230
-He knew.
-He knew.

982
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:18,310
-[Erick laughs]
-Yo, the girls in New Orleans sexy?

983
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:20,150
[Erick] LSU in Baton Rouge.

984
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:21,890
[Darius] They sexy?

985
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,810
[Erick] Yeah, girls in college sexy,

986
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,860
especially when Southern
right down the street.

987
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,780
[Freddy] HBC proximity - nice!

988
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,900
-[Darius] Thanks. Appreciate it.
-[Erick] Yeah, dawg.

989
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:31,390
[Darius] Excuse me.

990
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:35,180
Yo, that's Jamero Umber.

991
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,940
-Oh, snap! Come on.
-Let's go check.

992
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:39,530
-Hey, what's up, man? How you doing?
-How you?

993
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:41,490
-Fine, thanks, man.
-How are you?

994
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,020
What's up?

995
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:44,690
[boy] Yo, get his autograph.

996
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:46,770
[excited chattering]

997
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:48,490
-[boy 2] Whoa!
-[boy 3] Wow!

998
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:50,610
I didn't know he'd be coming!

999
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:10,240
[Erick] What's up, fam? Ma'am.

1000
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:12,100
What y'all doing over here?

1001
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:17,150
We came to support the young players.
This is a New York tradition every year.

1002
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:22,230
All the top players come out to Spence's
for Back Court Day, right?

1003
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,140
[kids] Right.

1004
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:25,570
[Emera] This year should be no different.

1005
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:28,520
This ain't every year
and your court in Philly.

1006
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:30,690
No. This my court now.

1007
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:33,110
Watch how you talk to Mother.

1008
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,100
[sniggers]
You call your moms "Mother"?

1009
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:36,490
-Yeah.
-You a weirdo, bro.

1010
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,350
-[kids laugh]
-Got a problem with that?

1011
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,930
You had all that slick shit
to say on Twitter, fam.

1012
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,140
Talk that slick shit now.

1013
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:45,980
I was hacked.

1014
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:48,230
[laughs] You are a hack.

1015
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:50,030
[kids] Oh!

1016
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:51,490
We'll see on the court.

1017
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:54,180
You on the court now, young bull.

1018
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:55,650
[kids] Oh!

1019
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:58,560
That's cute!
I mean a real game, though.

1020
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:01,530
Mm... You're the one who said,
"Take the clock off."

1021
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:04,570
One-on-one, you'd smoke somebody!

1022
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,640
Well, here we are.

1023
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,280
Come on. Protect this house!

1024
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,020
I mean... Look, I...

1025
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,490
I just had sex.

1026
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:18,770
[kids] What?

1027
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:20,240
[Emera] Excuse you?

1028
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:23,390
Not with you...
Not with Moms... your mother...

1029
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,430
-I just told you, watch your mouth.
-Ray, get your boy.

1030
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,520
-Watch it, mofo. Who you talking to?
-Be cool.

1031
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:30,240
-I'm talking to you.
-What's up?

1032
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:32,270
-What's up?
-[Ray] Erick, just walk away, man.

1033
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,610
Walk away, boy.

1034
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:34,860
[Erick sniggers]

1035
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,780
Yeah, keep laughing.

1036
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:40,070
-What you gon' do, bro?
-Come on, man.

1037
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,820
Come on, E. Scott. Come on, man.

1038
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:45,730
Nah. Give him the rock.

1039
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,140
[kids gasp, groan]

1040
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,490
You don't wanna do that.

1041
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:57,110
[cheering]

1042
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:27,690
[Seton groans]

1043
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:30,390
[Seton sighs]

1044
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:34,480
Good girl.

1045
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,600
That's a good girl.

1046
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,440
-Your drink.
-Thank you.

1047
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:51,310
[Seton's wife] Who's ready to fly?
Are we ready to fly? Oh, yes!

1048
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,810
Who's ready to fly?

1049
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:54,980
Are you ready to fly, baby girl?

1050
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:57,310
[man on news]
No one knows how the game started.

1051
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:01,190
You're seeing Erick Scott and Jamero Umber
at a charity event in New York City.

1052
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:02,680
Tensions were already high

1053
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:05,810
after going back and forth with each other
on social media.

1054
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:07,680
The only reason we know about this game

1055
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:10,310
is because
some kids that were there recorded it

1056
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,490
and posted it online. Take a look.

1057
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,860
[indistinct cheering]

1058
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,740
[groaning]

1059
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,860
[excited screaming]

1060
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:27,180
We don't know
who actually won this game,

1061
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:30,350
but there's a lot of people calling
wanting to see this video.

1062
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,900
This is the match-up
everyone's been dying to see.

1063
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,230
Only if you planned it.

1064
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:36,020
Did you plan it?

1065
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:39,070
Spence has had that event
every year since I was 19

1066
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:40,690
so... Spence planned it.

1067
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:41,930
Don't put that on me.

1068
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:46,060
I called the team rosters
and nobody got back to me... but Ray.

1069
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:48,780
-Who invited the Umbers?
-[Myra] Well, who--

1070
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:51,890
You're not supposed to be here.
I don't represent you yet.

1071
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,350
I'm not supposed to see him.

1072
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,190
I just want to know
what we might be up against legally.

1073
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:59,980
-Well, to be fair, I'm not sure.
-[Sam] I mean, it was a charity event.

1074
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:04,400
You and Jamero, you're private citizens
that were asked to come to that event.

1075
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,400
There were no officials there.

1076
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:08,980
There weren't even any rules,
or you woulda lost.

1077
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,560
Oh, man.

1078
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:12,280
How come we don't know who won?

1079
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:14,280
[Erick] Ray stopped the game.

1080
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,890
-Wait, why?
-[Ray] They don't need bad blood.

1081
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:20,680
This lockout will end eventually
and they gotta be on the same team

1082
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:22,390
so, right when they were tied...

1083
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,930
He held the ball like a spoiled schoolboy.

1084
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:27,860
-[Myra] Or a smart salesman.
-Hey, what you mad about?

1085
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:31,100
We had a bigger crowd,
we coulda sold more raffle tickets.

1086
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:34,400
Uh-uh. No, you couldn't have.
That's what I've been telling you.

1087
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,600
If you knew they were coming
and you knew they might play,

1088
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:41,850
Erick has an NBA contract. He's signed.
The contract was already in play.

1089
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,140
You know that message they play

1090
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:46,560
at the beginning
of every basketball game on TV?

1091
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:49,890
"Any use of this telecast
or any pictures, descriptions

1092
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:52,600
or accounts of the game
without the express consent..."

1093
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:55,900
Exactly. That could have been considered
an NBA event

1094
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:58,310
if you got NBA players there
and they were recording.

1095
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,780
That's what I mean
about owning their own image.

1096
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:02,990
We're at the height
of the information era.

1097
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,560
-It's true.
-[Sam] I mean, his likeness is everywhere.

1098
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:10,100
And the team gets to decide
whether or not he can post a selfie

1099
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:12,610
-or whether it's unflattering?
-[Erick] Wait.

1100
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:13,610
I can go to jail?

1101
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:16,780
Technically, you're... on neutral ground.

1102
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:18,900
I'm what?

1103
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:24,860
Well... Look,
in New Orleans, we say the neutral ground

1104
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:27,440
is the place where black slaves
and white folks...

1105
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:29,520
[Myra] What?

1106
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:35,850
Neutral ground is the median
where black vendors could sell to...

1107
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:36,900
[groaning]

1108
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:37,850
...without--

1109
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,940
Why are y'all acting like this?

1110
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,390
You just spoke about slavery
in front of Spence.

1111
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,650
Yeah, and?

1112
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:48,610
I have a rule on my court.

1113
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:51,860
This is my office.

1114
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:53,030
I'm here.

1115
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:54,890
My court.

1116
00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:01,310
Anybody who refers to the institution
of slavery in front of me,

1117
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:04,900
particularly in reference to basketball
or its players,

1118
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:08,270
must say the words

1119
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:11,940
or they are banished forever.

1120
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,890
You've got to be joking.

1121
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,930
You should probably just say it.

1122
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:20,570
-It's mad short too.
-What?

1123
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:23,810
I mean, you referred to a black person
as a commodity

1124
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:25,980
or a vendor during slave times...

1125
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,730
I'm not gonna parse on it
because the metaphor wasn't really...

1126
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:31,940
Okay.

1127
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:35,280
It's Sunday, I have a fucking hangover.
What are the goddamn words?

1128
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,860
"I love the Lord

1129
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:40,320
and all His black people."

1130
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:48,890
I'd love for you all
to get the fuck out of my office.

1131
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:50,900
[Darius] Yeah.

1132
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:54,810
-[Freddy] Yes!
-[Darius] We got this taped!

1133
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,780
That remind you of you?

1134
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,030
[Ray chuckles]

1135
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:11,650
Hey, I was never this cool.

1136
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:16,480
Even at my video-game zenith,
my tech savvy paled in comparison.

1137
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,100
[Sam sniggers]

1138
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:21,320
Well, you still know how
to employ those who can.

1139
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,440
You primed him up. He played the game.

1140
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:27,560
[Ray sighs]

1141
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,390
Yeah, well, he's not really talking to me.

1142
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:31,820
You bent his heart.

1143
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:34,600
You didn't have to do that.

1144
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:36,240
-I didn't ask you to.
-I wanted to.

1145
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:40,890
Well...

1146
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,690
Umber was about to assassinate him.
I've never seen E so shaken.

1147
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,890
I guess that's why
he doesn't sex before games.

1148
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:49,890
Yeah, well, nobody does right before.

1149
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:51,900
Except maybe Wilt.

1150
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:53,740
[Sam giggles]

1151
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,400
What did you start as for your cousin?

1152
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,850
-He was your first client, right?
-Yeah. Publicity.

1153
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:09,810
-You ran his marketing?
-Mm-hmm.

1154
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,610
First, there wasn't much to handle.
Moved into representation a little later.

1155
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:17,570
Did you tell him
to hide the fact he was gay?

1156
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:18,560
Yep.

1157
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:24,930
Do you regret that?

1158
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,940
I regret many things, Sam.

1159
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,320
Protecting my cousin's not one of 'em.

1160
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:35,310
You think, uh...

1161
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:37,990
think he'll be too hurt?

1162
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:39,890
-Who?
-Erick.

1163
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:41,430
Oh...

1164
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:44,400
It's hard to tell.

1165
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:46,520
He could rise to the occasion.

1166
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:55,230
We good?

1167
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:56,690
Yup.

1168
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:59,850
Just remember:
keep your head straight, tone light.

1169
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:02,940
"It was all just fun.
I wasn't tryin' to start nothin'."

1170
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,490
I got you.

1171
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,270
[camera shutters click]

1172
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,610
[Ray] Thank you all for coming
on a weekend at short notice.

1173
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:18,310
We just, uh...

1174
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:22,280
Well, I wanted my client
to have a chance to...

1175
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:26,890
Listen, his intentions were and are good.

1176
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:30,990
Both he and Jamero Umber were there
as guests of the Back Court charity event.

1177
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:34,940
They were set up...

1178
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,980
They were set up by me.

1179
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:46,230
[shocked gasping]

1180
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:50,560
What you all saw
on your smartphones and tablets...

1181
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:52,770
was raw.

1182
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,770
It was palpable and it was real.

1183
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:56,890
It was the beginning of change,

1184
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:59,480
change of this game that's been played
behind the game.

1185
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:00,930
What you saw yesterday...

1186
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:03,060
was just a glimmer,

1187
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:07,820
a lightning flash of what could be
the beginning of a whole new industry.

1188
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:12,110
Any questions?

1189
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:13,820
[journalists] Ray!

1190
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:15,990
[man] Is Erick going to the NBA or not?

1191
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:18,100
We'll have to wait and see.

1192
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:20,150
[Erick] You said,
"Don't worry about the money."

1193
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,770
-Change of plans.
-What are you doin', man?

1194
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:25,320
This is my career! I always dreamed
of playin' in the league.

1195
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:28,030
Is that what you dreamt of
when you were on the court with Spence?

1196
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:31,400
'Cause he said he was always having
to dig you out of some girl's room

1197
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,680
-or away from some hangout.
-I was a kid, fam!

1198
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:36,020
That's what kids in New York do
during summer camps.

1199
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:39,280
Girls in the Heights like you more
if they know you gon' be gone in the fall.

1200
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,990
Look, all I'm sayin' is
I was serious about the game then

1201
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:44,480
-and I'm serious about the game now.
-Hey, E!

1202
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,930
This didn't mess up your chances
with the team.

1203
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:50,180
Your contract is only pending
because of the lockout.

1204
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:52,560
As soon as the owners
and the PA come to an agreement,

1205
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:55,070
your check will move from escrow
to your account.

1206
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:57,610
Not if they think
I'm tryin' to pimp pickup games!

1207
01:00:57,690 --> 01:00:58,820
[sighs] Come on, E!

1208
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,440
Did you just hear me, man?

1209
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:05,030
Huh? You are not currently
legally bound to them.

1210
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:06,900
You are in the sweet spot.

1211
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:11,390
You have a chance, sir, to do
what has never been done before.

1212
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:14,270
We are disruptors - you, me and Umber.

1213
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,110
So, you just want to rep him, too?

1214
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:18,730
Why do you think so small?

1215
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:23,070
Man, you didn't feel it

1216
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,900
when you snatched that ball
out of Jamero's hand,

1217
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:29,070
when he thought he had you crossed up
and you picked his pockets?

1218
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:31,820
You didn't feel it?
Man, the whole world stopped.

1219
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:33,680
Those two kids watching

1220
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:36,560
haven't stopped dancing
and selfieing since.

1221
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:38,190
-You didn't see it?
-No, man.

1222
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:41,560
Man, when a million faces
that would normally record the game

1223
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:43,070
and fast-forward to the good parts,

1224
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:45,650
when they had to hear about it
at the water cooler,

1225
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:48,060
man, I knew right then
that we had they ass!

1226
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,890
We had something
that they can't bottle up.

1227
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:54,820
What would you pay

1228
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:58,360
to be at an event so exclusive

1229
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:02,930
that you could only catch glimmers of it
on Snapchat and YouTube?

1230
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:03,890
YouTube?

1231
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:06,520
Facebook called and said
they'd pay you and Umber

1232
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:08,690
for streaming rights to your one-on-one.

1233
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:11,310
-How much?
-It don't matter. I told 'em no.

1234
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,030
Fuck you do that for?

1235
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:16,440
'Cause Netflix wants a sit-down tomorrow.

1236
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:18,690
Only thing they don't have
is live streaming,

1237
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:20,350
but we could lead their market.

1238
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:25,480
The money would go direct to you two -
no Players Association, no league.

1239
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:28,190
Just ten percent for you,
then taxes, right?

1240
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:30,400
It ain't about the money, man.

1241
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,270
We talking about money 'cause that
makes them listen and pay attention,

1242
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:36,190
but this makes you the decider, brother.

1243
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:39,100
The game that they made
over the game is over.

1244
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:41,360
It's your game now if you want it.

1245
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:46,070
[sighs] Come on, South Side,
we don't need the league, man!

1246
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,360
We don't need the Players Association.

1247
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,860
Let them battle that shit out
over network rights

1248
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:54,240
and splits for the next few months
while you, me and a few others,

1249
01:02:54,310 --> 01:02:55,430
we wreck shop!

1250
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,180
Paid event by event, like...

1251
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,320
Boxing.

1252
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,900
But without the brain damage.

1253
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:02,850
Umber, he in?

1254
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:04,940
What you think?

1255
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:09,610
Now, I brought you to church,
so you know I wasn't speaking no lies.

1256
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:12,240
I can't beguile you
in the house of the Lord.

1257
01:03:12,310 --> 01:03:14,730
So, you're saying it's the gospel truth?

1258
01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:19,600
Listen, I saw them do it with Jayvier
when he signed with the Jets.

1259
01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:24,280
The NFL was talking about how he was young
and this and that.

1260
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,690
Oh, they had all this talk.

1261
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:28,810
But I'm a mother.

1262
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,990
God blessed me with two kids.

1263
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:35,240
And what's the Bible teach us?
Sow your seed that you may have a legacy.

1264
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:38,070
So, I was hard on 'em.

1265
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,070
I was their mother and their father.

1266
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:44,280
And you see how well Jay is doing
in the NFL.

1267
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:47,180
That's what I want for Jamero in the NBA.

1268
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:50,360
So, he can take his rightful place
on the throne.

1269
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:54,810
Do you have anything you want to say
to the league, the PA about the lockout?

1270
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:56,430
Oh, it's been said.

1271
01:03:57,310 --> 01:03:59,180
Uh-huh. That's all they do is talk.

1272
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:03,030
They need to get out the way with
all the talkin' and let the future in.

1273
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:06,770
-[Ray] I would say...
-[Spence] You don't know what you doin'?

1274
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:08,730
I do.

1275
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:12,190
Love it?

1276
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:14,230
Man, it feels so good.

1277
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,860
I know that feeling, you know.

1278
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:20,190
-[Ray chuckles]
-I know.

1279
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:21,180
Yeah?

1280
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:23,730
It's like it's funny because...

1281
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,980
You know, it's catchy, but not contagious.

1282
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:32,320
You know, it's like, you know,
you see what nobody else can see,

1283
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,320
but they all askin' for it,
they all want it.

1284
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,280
Yeah.

1285
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:39,190
When you all had the league,
what happened?

1286
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:42,430
Well, man...

1287
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,560
No-- Well...

1288
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:48,900
We made decisions
based on what we needed.

1289
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:53,610
And the players wanted
to play more like they done on the courts,

1290
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:54,820
so we allowed it, man.

1291
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:57,070
Man, you... Man, you could jump,

1292
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:00,650
you could slam on a cat
if he got in your way, man.

1293
01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:05,310
The whole game grew based on our hunger,
our hunger for it.

1294
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,490
Whoa. But you couldn't pay for it?

1295
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:10,980
Not enough.

1296
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:14,680
Man...

1297
01:05:16,610 --> 01:05:17,610
For a second,

1298
01:05:18,770 --> 01:05:20,770
man, I could see a whole infrastructure

1299
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:24,390
that put the control back in the hands
of those behind the ball,

1300
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,350
instead of those up in the sky box.

1301
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:30,480
-Nah, it can't sustain, man.
-It never had to.

1302
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,180
Don't hit me with that Ivy League talk--

1303
01:05:32,270 --> 01:05:35,270
-Spence, man, Rutgers ain't no Ivy League.
-Black Ivy, man.

1304
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:37,360
Why set it up

1305
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:40,310
if it's not gonna last forever?

1306
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,900
Why make a man if only to watch him die?

1307
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,680
Playin' God now.

1308
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:49,060
Nah, man.

1309
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:52,860
I just wanted to snatch the game
out they hands for a minute.

1310
01:05:54,270 --> 01:05:55,350
I don't need it.

1311
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:59,430
I just wanted to hold it,
just for a second.

1312
01:06:00,770 --> 01:06:03,060
So, they know... like I know.

1313
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:07,310
How do you show a man his humanity?

1314
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:10,230
You remind him of his mortality.

1315
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:21,900
[Adamn Killa "Roof Roof" plays]

1316
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:23,690
What's up?

1317
01:06:48,730 --> 01:06:49,730
Are you okay?

1318
01:06:51,310 --> 01:06:52,560
Tch... I don't know.

1319
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:56,350
[he sighs]

1320
01:06:58,150 --> 01:06:59,190
[she sighs]

1321
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:04,740
[Spence] Erick's not Gavin.

1322
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:05,810
[Ray] I know.

1323
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:08,740
-[Spence] He's not Ray, either.
-You think he's listening to me?

1324
01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:12,060
[Spence] You said you talked to him.
He reading his bible?

1325
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,820
[Ray] He's no visionary, man,
no revolutionary.

1326
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:17,990
He's a player, exactly the type of player
who needs to be in the league.

1327
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:20,140
You hire him to show up, play hard,

1328
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:22,850
get upset about the world
and take it out on the game

1329
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:25,320
-and he is one of the best.
-Yes, he is.

1330
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,780
But he ain't a game-changer.
He's just happy to be playin' the game.

1331
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:31,100
Well, you never know.

1332
01:07:31,770 --> 01:07:32,890
Are you mad at him?

1333
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:34,390
Nope.

1334
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:35,900
Not at all.

1335
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:41,360
He just barged in
and said you'd want to see him.

1336
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:45,020
[woman] He parked himself in your office.
I didn't know what to do.

1337
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:48,190
Just hold whoever called
or whoever comes by

1338
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:51,680
until I can catch my breath
and catch up with the rest of the world.

1339
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:54,390
Good morning, Myra!

1340
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:56,110
[Myra] David.

1341
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:58,350
Sorry to bother you first thing.

1342
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:01,610
I thought you were in New Zealand.

1343
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:04,940
Australia had to wait.
Something urgent's come up.

1344
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:07,280
-It did?
-Oh, yes.

1345
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:09,060
I thought you'd be happy.

1346
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:11,860
I started reading this agreement

1347
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:15,190
and I think I can talk the others
into a resolution.

1348
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:19,350
These guys, these men are giving us
their top-earning years.

1349
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:20,900
It's the least we can do.

1350
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:23,520
How generous.

1351
01:08:24,150 --> 01:08:26,690
Well, I'm approaching retirement myself
so...

1352
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:29,060
No, no... [chuckling]

1353
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:32,070
How generous do you think
you can talk the others into being?

1354
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,140
Ah. Well, not far from what you're asking.

1355
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:57,980
Hey there, fella.
You think you could move over a bit?

1356
01:09:20,230 --> 01:09:21,600
[relaxed sigh]

1357
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,850
How are you doing, David?

1358
01:09:27,190 --> 01:09:30,070
I'm all right, Ray. And you?

1359
01:09:30,150 --> 01:09:31,530
Well, I've been stressed.

1360
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:33,020
But you know that.

1361
01:09:33,730 --> 01:09:35,980
I mean, you don't know about it,
but you know.

1362
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:37,980
Oh, that's not fair. I stress.

1363
01:09:39,230 --> 01:09:40,640
This spot does help.

1364
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:43,940
I'm trying to enjoy it
while I can still afford it.

1365
01:09:44,730 --> 01:09:47,270
If you're trying to tug on pity,
that's not your style.

1366
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:49,990
You're not some newbie.
I know you're stored for the winter.

1367
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:53,680
Mayhaps, but the well's a little low
and I've got a farm to feed.

1368
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:56,530
Well, you grew up in the city.

1369
01:09:57,310 --> 01:09:58,810
Metaphor and that.

1370
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,990
I forget, did Gavin grow up in the city?

1371
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:09,110
Family's from Duval.

1372
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,890
Duval. Oh...

1373
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:12,890
Your country cousin, huh?

1374
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:16,230
His people and your people
still down there?

1375
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:19,480
My aunt still lives there, yeah,
but, again, you know that.

1376
01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:21,850
Indeed... [sighs]

1377
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:25,030
Still gotta spend a little something
to keep her coming to court?

1378
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:26,110
You know what?

1379
01:10:27,610 --> 01:10:30,990
-I'll let you have it.
-No, I got meetings to attend.

1380
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,060
I just came in to clear my sinuses.

1381
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,320
[blows nose]

1382
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:37,280
Ah...

1383
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:40,680
Guessing that's all the comfort relief
I'll get today.

1384
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,740
Gonna go see Myra?

1385
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:52,730
Nope, I already saw her.
That's done for today.

1386
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:58,110
I'm gonna see if our friends over at ABC
and NBC want to talk now or later.

1387
01:10:58,730 --> 01:10:59,560
Nice.

1388
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:04,280
It's a long weekend so, they'll probably
be more interested in "later."

1389
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,690
Yeah, that's fine.

1390
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:11,400
Why don't you just give the boys club
what they're asking for?

1391
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,100
"Boys." Ah...

1392
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,570
You know better
than to call them that, Ray.

1393
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:17,890
They are men.

1394
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,490
Knew what they were getting into
when they signed.

1395
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,730
And now they want to be sure what
they're getting after the signatures fade.

1396
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:25,690
Isn't that what they have you for?

1397
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:32,440
Look, their payout is more, yes,
but they have agents, managers, lawyers

1398
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:35,150
and most are still being taxed
as individuals. They--

1399
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:37,060
They are fine. It's fair.

1400
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,900
They get half, we get half.

1401
01:11:39,230 --> 01:11:42,270
Hell, we still gotta pay the organization.
Why should they get more?

1402
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,570
Well, there's more of them... every year.

1403
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:47,070
More mouths to feed.

1404
01:11:48,730 --> 01:11:52,930
You ever been in a relationship?
I mean, a real, beautiful relationship?

1405
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:56,530
Sometimes, you gotta let it stall

1406
01:11:56,610 --> 01:11:59,940
-before you recognize what you got.
-Before it's gone.

1407
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:00,850
Mmhmm.

1408
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:03,810
Well, David...

1409
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:07,610
where I'm from, Mr. Steal Your Girl
is more than just a song.

1410
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:11,110
He's younger, he's faster...

1411
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:15,350
and he doesn't have to show up
in courtside seats to make an impression.

1412
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:19,780
You're not thinking of breaking up
our happy marriage, are you?

1413
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:20,820
No.

1414
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:37,150
[man] Excuse me.

1415
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:40,690
Why am I not surprised?

1416
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:42,820
Sorry to ambush you, Doug.

1417
01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:46,600
This agent, Ray Burke,

1418
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:49,020
you know what he's doing?

1419
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:50,570
Well, you've met him.

1420
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:52,730
-He's smart.
-How smart?

1421
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:55,310
You saw the charity video.

1422
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:59,570
-Me and 24 million other people.
-Yeah, I don't think that's a real number.

1423
01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:01,190
I had Connie check it.

1424
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:05,030
While I was watching, I got a pop-up ad

1425
01:13:05,110 --> 01:13:07,940
for a "Lockout street ball" event
in Vegas tonight,

1426
01:13:08,230 --> 01:13:10,980
which I found intriguing
for a variety of reasons.

1427
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:12,060
Well, we've um...

1428
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:13,560
We canceled that.

1429
01:13:13,730 --> 01:13:14,730
The game?

1430
01:13:14,810 --> 01:13:15,850
The ad.

1431
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:20,360
We argued that the word "lockout"
is tacitly implying an NBA relationship.

1432
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:23,150
-I'm pretty sure it's pulled.
-Well, why wouldn't they?

1433
01:13:23,230 --> 01:13:25,430
They'd already sold out
the fucking building.

1434
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,770
StubHub's got a courtside single
for 1,400.

1435
01:13:30,690 --> 01:13:31,820
[Doug sighs]

1436
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:35,140
Tell me we don't have players
in Vegas tonight.

1437
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:36,850
Well, we're waiting on a list.

1438
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:40,520
And, no, I don't think
Ray Burke put this together.

1439
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:43,730
That would be the bad news, David.

1440
01:13:44,150 --> 01:13:46,820
That would mean this thing's out there
breathing on its own.

1441
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:51,690
Full disclosure,
there is a game in Miami tomorrow.

1442
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:55,100
You mean
the "Bring Your Ring Three-On-Three"?

1443
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,350
[sighs] You know what I hate about this?

1444
01:14:03,190 --> 01:14:04,900
It's exactly what I'd do.

1445
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:07,490
I think you can do better.

1446
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:09,520
Well, why?

1447
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:11,690
Because I know
some very valuable player's

1448
01:14:11,770 --> 01:14:13,810
having a conversation
with the competitors.

1449
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:17,190
Oh, you mean the meeting
that Ray Burke is supposed to be having

1450
01:14:17,310 --> 01:14:19,980
with Hulu or somebody?
Yeah. No, that didn't happen.

1451
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:22,940
We renegotiated with our networks
this morning.

1452
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,690
Like I told you, My...

1453
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:31,190
I had a real "come to Jesus" moment
about this whole thing.

1454
01:14:31,690 --> 01:14:35,190
I walked down there
and we figured out the contract,

1455
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,350
numbers to be decided in good faith,

1456
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:40,860
and I told them I was coming to see you
to put things to rights.

1457
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:43,530
-Told who?
-The team. NY.

1458
01:14:43,610 --> 01:14:45,740
You know you're not supposed to
talk to them without--

1459
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:47,930
No, I didn't talk.
I mean, I sent an email.

1460
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:51,060
I mean, I may be old school,
but I know how to hit "send."

1461
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:53,610
Yeah, I sent an email
at 9 a.m. this morning

1462
01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:57,610
stating that I would do everything
in my power to undo this lockout today.

1463
01:14:58,190 --> 01:15:00,570
Check your messages.
I CC'd you as players' rep.

1464
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:06,030
Like I told you, I believe in family.

1465
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:10,280
This team's my family.

1466
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:13,480
I need us to be one big family again.

1467
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:21,650
[she sighs]

1468
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,610
Have a seat.

1469
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:33,030
[Towns] I think the biggest thing
you have to also remember is you got

1470
01:15:33,110 --> 01:15:37,780
to make sure you reevaluate your circle,
you know? You gotta reevaluate...

1471
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:40,820
"All right, does this person
need to be here for the ride?

1472
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:43,780
Or have they been riding my coattails?
Have they been real to me?"

1473
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:46,740
You know, it's always good
to sit back sometimes

1474
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:49,600
and reevaluate, "Are the people around you
there for you

1475
01:15:49,690 --> 01:15:52,110
or are they there for you
after June 25th?"

1476
01:15:52,190 --> 01:15:53,610
That was my draft day.

1477
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:58,610
So, if they're there for you
no matter what happens,

1478
01:15:58,730 --> 01:16:00,640
there's good friends,
but you must understand

1479
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:03,020
sometimes even the people
who are there for you

1480
01:16:03,110 --> 01:16:04,990
may not be the people
you need to have around.

1481
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:08,180
They may not be the best people to have
around you for your image

1482
01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:12,100
or for the journey
you're gonna be a part of.

1483
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:14,190
[muzak playing]

1484
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:23,560
Morning, Sam.

1485
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:26,110
Need to talk?

1486
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:28,140
I wanted to prime you.

1487
01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:31,690
I told you,
I like my news straight from the source.

1488
01:16:32,810 --> 01:16:34,140
Well, um...

1489
01:16:35,150 --> 01:16:36,650
Erick's gonna fire you.

1490
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:38,890
Why?

1491
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:43,180
It's a conclusion he came to
after we talked.

1492
01:16:46,730 --> 01:16:48,140
Or he thinks he's gonna fire you.

1493
01:16:48,230 --> 01:16:50,430
He's really just moving laterally
in the company.

1494
01:16:51,230 --> 01:16:52,270
It's his decision?

1495
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:54,560
-All him.
-No coaching?

1496
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:56,940
He's been coached his whole life.

1497
01:16:57,940 --> 01:17:01,400
It's actually good to see him choose
how he's gonna be represented.

1498
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:03,350
-Hmm.
-Mm.

1499
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:07,100
What, um...

1500
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:09,400
What about you?

1501
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:11,280
What about me?

1502
01:17:12,610 --> 01:17:13,860
You firing me too?

1503
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:18,930
I don't work for you anymore!
[laughs]

1504
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,180
Are you... "moving laterally"?

1505
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:25,270
No, I'm just...

1506
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:27,980
moving towards the goal.

1507
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:30,390
Feel like it's a good move?

1508
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,850
-All moves towards a goal are good.
-[chuckles]

1509
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:34,940
Starr know that?

1510
01:17:35,310 --> 01:17:37,020
Starr don't know shit from Shine.

1511
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:38,930
-Well played.
-Mmhmm.

1512
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:43,530
And when's Myra stepping down?

1513
01:17:45,690 --> 01:17:48,150
In, like, a year, after the baby's born.

1514
01:17:48,270 --> 01:17:51,230
Good. Gives you enough time
to learn the lay of the land.

1515
01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:55,560
Yeah, gives me enough time to learn it
and enough time to run it.

1516
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:58,570
I don't like working for anyone.

1517
01:17:58,730 --> 01:18:01,930
-You'll be working for every player--
-Yeah, for now.

1518
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:09,060
Well, you need help moving out of SAV?

1519
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:13,690
Are you gonna take pity on Erick?

1520
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:18,100
Think I should?

1521
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:20,270
No.

1522
01:18:22,150 --> 01:18:24,280
I like him better
when he stands up for himself.

1523
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:26,440
He's good on defense.

1524
01:18:28,150 --> 01:18:29,240
[she chuckles]

1525
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:30,940
Pray for me?

1526
01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:40,390
Go forth and...

1527
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:42,650
sin no more.

1528
01:18:43,730 --> 01:18:44,560
Amen.

1529
01:18:45,610 --> 01:18:46,490
Ashe.

1530
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:20,640
You lied to me.

1531
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:23,270
You said this was about the money.

1532
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,780
Yo, Sam told me you ain't even talked
to the people today.

1533
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:30,860
She said they called this morning and
confirmed you canceled. What happened?

1534
01:19:32,730 --> 01:19:34,390
Oh, you all outta stuff to say?

1535
01:19:34,730 --> 01:19:37,430
You used to talk shit about how
we gon' change the game and whatnot.

1536
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:38,680
What happened, bro?

1537
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:41,730
I'ma tell you what happened.

1538
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:44,850
You realized there weren't a big enough
chunk for you without the league in it.

1539
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:47,740
Without the league, there wasn't enough
for you to suck off of.

1540
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:51,150
You weren't looking out for me.

1541
01:19:51,230 --> 01:19:54,520
Talking about all this money we gon' make,
but the whole time, you knew.

1542
01:19:54,610 --> 01:19:56,610
You knew the league
would've blackballed me.

1543
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:59,150
You almost ruined that, Ray,
and you don't care?

1544
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:01,820
Ain't "first do no harm" in the contract?

1545
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:03,900
That's the Hippocratic oath.
I'm not a doctor.

1546
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:05,270
Yeah, you fired, though.

1547
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:10,990
I said you fired, man!

1548
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:13,180
I heard you.

1549
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:17,730
So, what you gon' do? Sam told me
you ain't even in talks with the Umbers.

1550
01:20:17,810 --> 01:20:20,850
Said Jamero wasn't ever down
with the one-on-one game style.

1551
01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:23,810
What you gon' do?

1552
01:20:24,110 --> 01:20:25,280
What I was born to do.

1553
01:20:25,610 --> 01:20:26,650
What I came to do.

1554
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:29,990
Good luck, Erick.

1555
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:33,020
-[sniffs]
-Good luck.

1556
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:37,690
Ray?

1557
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:45,030
Don't let 'em fool you
all your life, fella.

1558
01:20:46,690 --> 01:20:48,610
You were born for way more than this.

1559
01:20:50,230 --> 01:20:51,520
Don't let 'em fool you.

1560
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:02,990
I tell you this.

1561
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:07,150
Thank God everyone at the event
was thinking about the team.

1562
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:11,740
So, you were loyal to New York,
even in the lockout?

1563
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:16,240
[Emera] Oh, I think this lockout is
on its last leg.

1564
01:21:17,150 --> 01:21:18,150
I really do.

1565
01:21:18,230 --> 01:21:22,020
For me, the beginnin' of the year
was my mental was all over the place,

1566
01:21:22,150 --> 01:21:25,320
worryin' about the Rookie of the Year
award and all this outer stuff

1567
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:26,400
and I struggled.

1568
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,980
You know, I've never worried about,
you know, these awards,

1569
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:30,520
that's never been my mentality.

1570
01:21:30,610 --> 01:21:33,490
I come in here and I'm like,
"Who's gonna win it?

1571
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:36,140
Who's doing this? Who's doing what?"
And, you know, I think I scored

1572
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:38,680
a combined 22 points in ten games,
you know, like,

1573
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:42,680
and, like, 20 turnovers
so I wasn't really contributing much.

1574
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:46,140
So, I think I took a step back, you know.

1575
01:21:46,230 --> 01:21:48,850
I had the screensaver of
the Rookie of the Year votes on my phone,

1576
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:50,190
that was my screensaver.

1577
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:55,440
Switched that, took it all off and, like,
just went back to who I was.

1578
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:58,850
You know, Steph Curry out there
playing completely free.

1579
01:21:59,190 --> 01:22:02,320
He looks like he's living
in his own world. You see Russ...

1580
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:05,600
At the same time,
Russell Westbrook, those guys...

1581
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:07,310
LeBron.

1582
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,400
You can go down the line of guys who
look like they're playing the most free

1583
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:13,100
and the guys actually enjoying
just playing basketball

1584
01:22:13,190 --> 01:22:14,940
are the guys having the most success.

1585
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:16,060
You've got to find fun.

1586
01:22:16,150 --> 01:22:19,280
I think when you lose fun for the game
and the passion,

1587
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:22,690
that's when everything goes downhill
or you just... quit.

1588
01:22:22,810 --> 01:22:25,930
You know, I think the biggest thing
about the game of basketball

1589
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:28,020
that I love so much
and no matter what happens...

1590
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:31,320
It's not even basketball, just anything
in life. I love the competition.

1591
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,610
The better the competition,
the more fun it becomes.

1592
01:22:33,690 --> 01:22:38,070
I'm just trying to make
an awkward situation not sound so bad.

1593
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,530
How bad is it?

1594
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,690
-Ray, your assistant had--
-Former assistant.

1595
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:46,990
Former assistant had to save
this company's relationship

1596
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:49,520
with one of the best players
to enter the league.

1597
01:22:50,150 --> 01:22:52,990
Sam told me she advised Erick
to find someone else at SAV.

1598
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:55,270
Well, as an assistant
at the Players Association,

1599
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,990
I'd say that's good counsel.

1600
01:22:57,770 --> 01:22:58,640
What?

1601
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:01,390
You didn't know that's where she's going?

1602
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:05,180
So, we lost an assistant agent
all because you were being reckless?

1603
01:23:05,610 --> 01:23:06,860
Mm... One vantage.

1604
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:10,180
The way I hear it,
Erick almost lost his contract with NY,

1605
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:13,930
therefore you almost lost him
for us as a client.

1606
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:15,890
-Never.
-And then you're meeting with Netflix

1607
01:23:15,980 --> 01:23:19,770
without anyone from Legal weighing in,
without even running it by another agent.

1608
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:22,940
We never met. I just set up a meeting.
Those are okay, yes?

1609
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:25,680
-For what?
-So that people would know about it.

1610
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:27,680
You're being snide.

1611
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,650
-If I were in your position, I'd--
-You're not.

1612
01:23:30,730 --> 01:23:32,890
You might not be, either,
if upstairs got wind of this.

1613
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:35,810
-What were you thinking?
-You told me to do something.

1614
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:37,600
Not fuck up our cash cow!

1615
01:23:37,690 --> 01:23:39,280
Erick Scott is still here

1616
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,740
and once the lockout finally ends,
he can play.

1617
01:23:43,110 --> 01:23:46,030
Ah. Well, thank God, at least that's over.

1618
01:23:46,150 --> 01:23:46,990
Hmm?

1619
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,060
What, you didn't hear?

1620
01:23:51,230 --> 01:23:53,560
-The lockout's basically done.
-Hmm.

1621
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:56,100
Myra and the owners sat down this morning.

1622
01:23:56,810 --> 01:23:57,930
I think that's a record.

1623
01:23:58,650 --> 01:24:01,490
Only took me... 72 hours.

1624
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,610
You see it, right?

1625
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:13,560
All that... You did all that?

1626
01:24:15,190 --> 01:24:18,240
All the players that were signed before
are still signed now.

1627
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:22,810
And the well in the mirage,
as you put it, is back on.

1628
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:26,270
Well, that's--

1629
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:28,190
Erick Scott was never in any danger.

1630
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,890
And Sam... she's in a better place.

1631
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:33,730
She was not long for this world.

1632
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:44,560
But 72 hours to somehow
get both sides to sit down

1633
01:24:44,690 --> 01:24:47,110
-and agree to put the game back on...
-Yeah.

1634
01:24:47,190 --> 01:24:48,690
Well, yeah. It's... [chuckles]

1635
01:24:48,810 --> 01:24:51,390
...I mean, you did it, Ray.

1636
01:24:51,770 --> 01:24:52,770
Yeah, I did.

1637
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:54,980
You want to go upstairs and tell 'em?

1638
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:57,490
You want me to?

1639
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,900
What you think they might say?

1640
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:04,730
Anything happened outside of the lines,

1641
01:25:04,810 --> 01:25:07,310
I was just following orders,
just doing my job.

1642
01:25:11,650 --> 01:25:12,860
No, you've done well.

1643
01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:15,860
You kept your head down
and your nose clean.

1644
01:25:17,150 --> 01:25:18,530
But now you gotta get up.

1645
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:21,360
You're sitting in my seat.

Your 10:30's here.

1649
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:33,940
Excuse me.

1650

Dr. Edwards.

1651

-Thank you for having me.
-Thank you for coming, sir.

-Thank you.
-Have a seat.
