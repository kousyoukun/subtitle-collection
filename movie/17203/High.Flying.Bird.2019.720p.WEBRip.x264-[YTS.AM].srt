1
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,921
[man] Does the NBA have a system in place

2
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:15,338
for dealing with rookies?

3
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:19,588
Yeah, we have... It's called RTP,
Rookie Transition Program, so, um,

4
00:00:20,296 --> 00:00:21,546
mine was the year after.

5
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,755
Anybody that was drafted in 2011
or lockout class,

6
00:00:24,838 --> 00:00:26,838
you'd probably do it the year following,

7
00:00:26,921 --> 00:00:30,005
but when you're drafted,
you're with your team for a while,

8
00:00:30,088 --> 00:00:34,588
you have a good four- or five-day period
where they bring you together in New York

9
00:00:34,671 --> 00:00:37,130
and go over
the ins and outs of the league

10
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:40,380
and things to expect, but, no,
I think they do a good job

11
00:00:40,463 --> 00:00:43,005
in trying to present everything
that's gonna be there

12
00:00:43,088 --> 00:00:46,296
but there's nothing like the experience
and living it is still...

13
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:50,421
Someone telling me what I'd go through
and living it was two different worlds.

14
00:00:50,505 --> 00:00:53,005
I tried to prepare
to the best of my ability, but...

15
00:00:53,713 --> 00:00:57,088
it's a monster that I don't think
anybody can prepare for.

16
00:00:57,171 --> 00:00:59,546
- [man] What you promise?
- [man 2] Ray, I ain't promise shit.

17
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,463
[Ray] You must've signed something.
You said he's calling, threatening.

18
00:01:02,546 --> 00:01:04,838
- You must've promised something.
- [man 2] I came to you.

19
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:06,713
[Ray] Erick, I'm asking you about this.

20
00:01:06,796 --> 00:01:10,036
[Erick] When the first negotiation failed
with the league and Players Association,

21
00:01:10,088 --> 00:01:11,928
I said, "Let me hold something
to float me by."

22
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,463
- I came to you first.
- [Ray] I said it didn't look good.

23
00:01:14,546 --> 00:01:16,226
[Erick] How many agents
give players money?

24
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:19,463
[Ray] There's precedence.
It's not protocol. Not during a lockout.

25
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:22,130
Last time this happened, folks went broke.

26
00:01:22,213 --> 00:01:24,338
- [Erick] Who tryin' to be broke?
- [Ray] You still broke!

27
00:01:24,421 --> 00:01:26,088
You ain't even in the league yet...

28
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:28,796
- [man 3] Everything okay?
- [Ray] Yeah. Check, please.

29
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:30,880
Uh, wait a second. Here you go.

30
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,088
So, what? Now you rushin' me off?

31
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:40,296
I am no longer having a good time.

32
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,588
Yeah, me and you both.

33
00:01:42,755 --> 00:01:44,296
- He got yo' ass.
- Who?

34
00:01:44,963 --> 00:01:46,255
You a owl now? You.

35
00:01:47,588 --> 00:01:49,088
You just telling me this now,

36
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:51,463
jumping at me, Erick Scott,
when <i>you </i>got got.

37
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,421
That man ain't meet you by happenstance
at your homie's party six months ago.

38
00:01:56,921 --> 00:01:59,880
He meant to rock up to whoever's
pre-season soiree was going down

39
00:01:59,963 --> 00:02:01,005
and catch him a rookie.

40
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,796
And he caught the big fish, yeah.

41
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,171
- Come on, man.
- Oh, the number-one signer!

42
00:02:05,546 --> 00:02:06,755
He got yo' ass.

43
00:02:07,296 --> 00:02:10,880
Don't get me wrong. You helped.
Smilin'. What'd he say?

44
00:02:11,838 --> 00:02:14,255
"Big fan. Saw all your games at LSU."

45
00:02:14,546 --> 00:02:17,505
Couldn't wait for you to sign to New York,
wouldn't have to travel to you?

46
00:02:17,588 --> 00:02:20,213
Gave a nerdy laugh,
made you think he was a cornball?

47
00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:21,463
- Damn.
- Mm-hmm.

48
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,421
See, he heard about the trouble.
Meetings happening and no resolution.

49
00:02:25,505 --> 00:02:28,755
Everybody expecting something to come down
to the wire, as always,

50
00:02:28,838 --> 00:02:31,588
and the owners or players to fold,
but if they didn't...

51
00:02:32,546 --> 00:02:34,546
"Wonder how people are gonna survive."

52
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,421
He scared you, describing how a lockout
doesn't affect the Stephs and Durants.

53
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:39,671
"They got that long money."

54
00:02:39,755 --> 00:02:41,963
It'll take a minute
before it affect their daily life.

55
00:02:42,046 --> 00:02:46,647
But those check-to-check fellas just starting out, the
rookies..." -He said... He used the term "freshmen."

56
00:02:48,796 --> 00:02:51,630
He saw you panic and offered you
some dumb interest loan from his bank.

57
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,880
You should have asked yourself then,

58
00:02:54,838 --> 00:02:58,005
"What's his angle?
Why is he being so damn generous to me?"

59
00:02:58,213 --> 00:03:00,963
Then you should have said,
"Hey, man, I'm doing all right."

60
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:03,588
My agent, who isn't being paid
during the lockout,

61
00:03:03,713 --> 00:03:05,796
"told me don't take a loan
unless I can pay for it."

62
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,755
At which point, I'd have said,
I being you in this case...

63
00:03:08,838 --> 00:03:09,838
"That's stupid."

64
00:03:09,921 --> 00:03:11,546
That's right, Erick. "That's stupid."

65
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,713
It wouldn't be a loan
if I could pay it back then.

66
00:03:13,796 --> 00:03:15,876
- See that logic? Don't take loans.
- I needed money.

67
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:17,338
For the fuck what?!

68
00:03:17,421 --> 00:03:20,713
You had money to move here.
You moved here. Your rent is paid.

69
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:22,505
Now I'm shouting.

70
00:03:23,046 --> 00:03:27,296
- Look, Ray, I'm sorry...
- Hey, E, spare me your apologies, okay?

71
00:03:27,505 --> 00:03:30,338
This isn't Sister Ray's Prep Academy
where you do something stupid,

72
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:32,421
I rap your knuckles,
tell you to say the rosary

73
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:34,421
and all is forgiven.
You just being you.

74
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,880
What?

75
00:03:36,171 --> 00:03:38,213
Here's what you thought
signing to the NBA would be.

76
00:03:38,296 --> 00:03:41,588
Not a chance to show your talent,
not as a vehicle to a better world

77
00:03:41,671 --> 00:03:44,005
or to change how the game is played
by pushing your limits,

78
00:03:44,088 --> 00:03:46,630
your team's limits
into athletic glory. No.

79
00:03:46,838 --> 00:03:50,671
You thought, "I can't wait to sign
that contract and stunt on these fools."

80
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,963
It'll be a big 'fuck you' to the naysayers
and the hate swayers.

81
00:03:54,046 --> 00:03:57,046
Just wait till I swag out,
finally get Moms a new spot

82
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,505
"and use Ray as the daddy I never met."

83
00:03:59,671 --> 00:04:01,755
But signed or not, we are in a lockout.

84
00:04:02,005 --> 00:04:04,338
Time for you to get
that daddy's dream dick out your mouth.

85
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:08,588
- Yo, pause, bro.
- Or after you made that stupid decision,

86
00:04:08,713 --> 00:04:11,380
you could've told Joe Blow loan shark,
"Thanks, man."

87
00:04:11,463 --> 00:04:14,213
Yeah, I got your money,
I spent it on some dumb shit.

88
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,630
I know it was a six-month,
very short-term loan

89
00:04:16,713 --> 00:04:20,463
with very stupid, dumb-ass interest,
but I thought I'd be playing by now.

90
00:04:20,546 --> 00:04:22,421
I'm not, so I don't got money
to pay you back.

91
00:04:22,505 --> 00:04:23,921
"Fuck you, have a nice life."

92
00:04:24,005 --> 00:04:26,838
What's the worst he could do?
Give you bad credit?

00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:28,441
- I already got...
- Rhetorical. Right.

94
00:04:29,963 --> 00:04:31,546
[sighs] My point, Erick, is...

95
00:04:32,546 --> 00:04:33,796
he can't do shit else.

96
00:04:34,296 --> 00:04:36,630
He's gon' call non-stop,
maybe send a summons,

97
00:04:36,713 --> 00:04:39,505
but you're stressing
like he can schedule a drive-by.

98
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,880
- You wrong.
- On what? Climate change?

99
00:04:41,963 --> 00:04:44,171
I didn't come to the league
to say fuck you to nobody.

100
00:04:44,255 --> 00:04:46,713
- I was made for the league.
- The league is a business.

101
00:04:46,796 --> 00:04:49,671
- It's all business?
- Yes, Erick, business.

102

- [Erick sighs]
- We are in business. Hey!

You want to get back on the court
and I want to get you there.

But right now, we have to wait, okay?

105
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,421
You can do that.
Or I don't know, man, practice.

00:05:06,796 --> 00:05:08,713
Still got your pregame ritual down?

107
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:11,546
- No sex before a game.
- I'll assume you practicing.

108
00:05:14,463 --> 00:05:15,463
Listen.

fall by the wayside?

but it don't sell sneakers.

112
00:05:26,088 --> 00:05:30,255
You can't see the players half the time.
Baseball... is a whole lot of tradition,

00:15:11,255 --> 00:15:13,380
[sighs] They aren't built for change.

303
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,880
None of 'em.

304
00:15:15,505 --> 00:15:18,713
The owners, the Players Association...
The firm is just a siphon.

305
00:15:19,296 --> 00:15:22,296
The smallest shift in the system,
everything gets fucked up.

306
00:15:23,046 --> 00:15:25,046
Player gets hurt, his life is fucked.

307
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:27,755
Team owner says "Negroes," his life is...

308
00:15:27,838 --> 00:15:31,630
Well, annoying, but more effectively,
his players get fucked.

309
00:15:33,213 --> 00:15:35,921
City can't afford to house its home team,
Brooklyn gets fucked.

310
00:15:36,005 --> 00:15:37,421
- Brooklyn gets fucked.
- I'm sitting,

311
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:40,421
looking Starr in his face, he's acting
like the life of that company

312
00:15:40,505 --> 00:15:43,266
is gon' be worse off than some
of these players about to go back to...

313
00:15:43,838 --> 00:15:45,338
- Ray...
- I'm just saying, man.

314
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,463
You care all the way
or you don't care at all, man.

315
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:52,296
Getting ready to preach?

316
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,213
They snatching 'em out the womb, like...

317
00:15:54,296 --> 00:15:57,216
- You preachin'?
- Cats your boys' age, they hungry to get them out there.

318
00:15:58,296 --> 00:16:02,088
Ain't even really finished high school yet
but they won't explain 37% tax.

319
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:05,005
- They won't explain agency fees.
- Hmm.

320
00:16:07,213 --> 00:16:08,213
Look,

321
00:16:08,755 --> 00:16:11,921
there's a reason why
the NBA started integrating

322
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,421
as the Harlem Globetrotters exhibitions
started goin' international.

323
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,130
Control.

324
00:16:18,838 --> 00:16:23,088
They wanted the control of a game
that we play, we played better.

325
00:16:23,838 --> 00:16:28,296
They invented a game... on top of a game.

326
00:16:28,838 --> 00:16:29,838
[Ray] Hmm.

327
00:16:30,005 --> 00:16:31,046
The question is...

328
00:16:31,963 --> 00:16:33,088
what you gon' do?

329
00:16:34,338 --> 00:16:35,380
You in or you out?

330
00:16:36,338 --> 00:16:37,338
I'm not out.

331
00:16:38,421 --> 00:16:39,713
I'm just outside.

332
00:16:43,421 --> 00:16:45,088
But I'm about to pull up a chair.

333
00:16:47,546 --> 00:16:49,671
Hey, man, you can't save 'em all, man.

334
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:52,296
Couldn't save Gavin.

335
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,380
[sneakers squeak, footsteps]

336
00:16:59,171 --> 00:17:01,380
Hey, man, I gotta go.

337
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,421
- Back Court Day.
- Yeah, I am, I'm coming.

338
00:17:05,005 --> 00:17:08,046
I'm gonna bring you an event...
you won't forget.

339
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,880
That's a promise.

340
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:12,130
Gotta go talk to Myra first.

341
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,630
Why?

342
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,505
Did they come to an agreement?

343
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,880
Ain't nothing but a modern-day auction...

344
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:20,338
Oh... [chuckles]

345
00:17:22,046 --> 00:17:23,171
[sighs]

346
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:27,463
"I love the Lord..."

347
00:17:29,463 --> 00:17:32,546
"and all His black peoples."

348
00:17:38,838 --> 00:17:39,921
[Spence] Run!

349
00:17:42,088 --> 00:17:45,005
I think the biggest rookie mistake
that you can make

350
00:17:45,088 --> 00:17:47,088
is being satisfied with making it.

351
00:17:47,838 --> 00:17:51,505
You know, the satisfic... satisfaction
of making the NBA

352
00:17:51,588 --> 00:17:54,130
is the night of the draft
when you get drafted,

353
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:58,380
the night after the draft or the day after
the draft I'll even give the rookies,

354
00:17:58,463 --> 00:18:02,463
but there shouldn't be no satisfaction
when you get to work.

355
00:18:02,546 --> 00:18:05,338
When you get to work,
you've already had the glory,

356
00:18:05,421 --> 00:18:08,505
you've been patted on the back enough
about making it to the NBA.

357
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,671
It's time for work now.

358
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,921
Now you have to fight to keep your job
every single day,

359
00:18:13,213 --> 00:18:16,755
and being satisfied with making it
and just running through the motions

360
00:18:16,838 --> 00:18:19,171
is the biggest mistake
any rookies can make.

361
00:18:32,088 --> 00:18:33,296
[knocking]

362
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:37,463
Hi, Myra!

363
00:18:37,755 --> 00:18:38,755
- Yes?
- It's Sam.

364
00:18:39,255 --> 00:18:41,088
Samantha. I'm Ray Burke's assistant.

365
00:18:41,171 --> 00:18:45,005
Oh... Oh, yes! Didn't you just call me
to confirm the meeting with Ray?

366
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:46,505
Oh, yeah, same Sam.

367
00:18:46,588 --> 00:18:49,421
Um... You think
I could get a ride with you?

368
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,796
He just... seems off.

369
00:18:55,338 --> 00:18:57,005
When you say "off,"

370
00:18:58,046 --> 00:19:01,630
are his eyes wide, like, open,
like a deer?

371
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:06,671
And his jaw is clenched as though
he's chewing on bad steak?

372
00:19:09,005 --> 00:19:10,005
Um...

373
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:14,088
Wow, that's really specific, but yes.

374
00:19:15,963 --> 00:19:17,046
That's not off.

375
00:19:17,421 --> 00:19:18,505
That's in.

376
00:19:19,505 --> 00:19:20,838
He's up to something.

377
00:19:21,671 --> 00:19:22,921
Thanks for the heads-up.

378
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:27,130
- Wait. No, I'm sorry. I wasn't trying...
- No, it's too late now.

379
00:19:27,213 --> 00:19:28,838
You done let it slip. [Sniffs]

380
00:19:29,588 --> 00:19:32,380
Don't worry, though.
Ray's "up to something" is usually good.

381
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,505
Like I said, he can see the business.

382
00:19:34,713 --> 00:19:37,171
He's a few steps ahead. [Chuckles]

383
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,171
When I first met Ray,
he was on a strategy.

384
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,226
I thought he was just trying
to curry favor

385
00:19:42,296 --> 00:19:46,588
for his already then star-like cousin,
but he... the cousin had a secret.

386
00:19:47,296 --> 00:19:50,796
Things like that were hard to hide,
even before social media blew up.

387
00:19:52,463 --> 00:19:56,171
You know, no one knows this
and Ray, he'll deny it to this day,

388
00:19:56,755 --> 00:19:59,463
but he kept trying to get Gavin
to get out ahead of it.

389
00:19:59,671 --> 00:20:03,130
He kept telling him to use it,
you know, make it a part of the appeal,

390
00:20:03,213 --> 00:20:04,630
a part of the whole package.

391
00:20:05,213 --> 00:20:07,713
I mean, Gavin was one of the best.
[sighs]

392
00:20:07,963 --> 00:20:10,213
And when you have
one of the best hiding something,

393
00:20:10,338 --> 00:20:12,963
it either eats away at the game
or the person.

394
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,838
In this case, it was mostly the person.

395
00:20:20,546 --> 00:20:23,130
Thank you, Myra,
for telling me all that you could.

396
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,171
Thank you for... trespassing.

397
00:20:26,463 --> 00:20:29,983
I'm sorry. But, you know, desperate times,
right? Hardly. Lady, you have a bright future.

398
00:20:33,338 --> 00:20:35,630
Sure I didn't overstep
with that licensing suggestion?

399
00:20:35,713 --> 00:20:36,755
- "Overstep"?
- Mm-hmm.

400
00:20:36,838 --> 00:20:39,588
That's where we were headed
if this lockout hadn't happened.

401
00:20:39,713 --> 00:20:41,921
- Come work for us. We could use...
- Ooh...

402
00:20:42,838 --> 00:20:44,130
I don't like to be used.

403
00:20:49,171 --> 00:20:51,296
[Myra] She beat you to the punch, Ray-Ray?

404
00:20:52,213 --> 00:20:55,171
You know, I hate when people not my mama
call me Ray-Ray.

405
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,505
Is there more in the bowl, My-My?

406
00:20:57,838 --> 00:21:00,338
We'll see. You're buying the rounds,
you're late.

407
00:21:00,421 --> 00:21:04,046
I'm just asking for confirmation.
You want this over. Everybody does.

408
00:21:04,546 --> 00:21:07,546
- Do it for the kids.
- What kids? You don't even have kids.

409
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,213
- To the future.
- [Myra scoffs]

410
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,421
[glasses clink]

411
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:14,296
- You still want 'em?
- What?

412
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,463
Do you still want kids?
You all still trying?

413
00:21:16,546 --> 00:21:18,296
- Look, Ray, don't...
- I'm just asking.

414
00:21:18,713 --> 00:21:19,713
[Myra sighs]

415
00:21:20,505 --> 00:21:21,838
- You know we do.
- Hmm.

416
00:21:22,171 --> 00:21:24,491
- We've tried.
- How's it going? Oh, we running some tests.

417
00:21:28,796 --> 00:21:31,296
Caroline was gonna have the baby, but...

418
00:21:31,963 --> 00:21:34,171
now we're running some tests
to see if I can.

419
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:37,755
So, you gonna be needin' some time off.

420
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,671
- You are a shit.
- I'm just trying to figure...

421
00:21:41,755 --> 00:21:43,505
My womb isn't blocking you, Ray.

422
00:21:43,838 --> 00:21:45,255
I want this shit over too.

423
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:48,255
You just seem relaxed for a meeting
that doesn't seem to have good news

424
00:21:48,338 --> 00:21:50,796
with a pool of,
what did you call 'em, horny sharks?

425
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:54,796
Maybe you need to go on leave early.
Maybe your head's not in the negotiation.

426
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,671
- Fuck you.
- So, like, Surrogate Ray? Uncle Ray?

427
00:21:58,255 --> 00:21:59,713
The meeting is a formality.

428
00:21:59,838 --> 00:22:02,255
- Nothing's changed, twat.
- So, why have it?

429
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,671
It's an up-or-down vote.
The owners aren't budging.

430
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:11,046
They like the 50/50 split on our revenue,
but the players don't

431
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,630
because they have to spread it out
amongst too many other players,

432
00:22:13,713 --> 00:22:15,380
especially with the surge in income.

433
00:22:15,463 --> 00:22:17,463
The meeting's just there as a formality,

434
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:20,630
just to say we met and tried
before the holiday weekend.

435
00:22:22,588 --> 00:22:25,921
Even if I was trying to get pregnant,
it wouldn't happen before Tuesday.

436
00:22:26,213 --> 00:22:27,921
So, my head is in the game, dick,

437
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:31,671
and the Players Association, which I rep,
has spoken

438
00:22:32,088 --> 00:22:35,048
and they are not moving. And the owners,
well, they don't even give a fuck.

439
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,588
Half of 'em won't even show.

440
00:22:39,671 --> 00:22:41,505
- Hey...
- What?

441
00:22:42,713 --> 00:22:43,838
Uh... [chuckles]

442
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:45,713
You need some coffee.

443
00:22:47,005 --> 00:22:49,755
There's a spot right on the corner.

444
00:22:50,296 --> 00:22:52,296
Trying to enjoy that burn while you can?

445
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:54,505
[Myra scoffs]

446
00:22:54,796 --> 00:22:57,088
Man, I was never that girl!

447
00:22:57,838 --> 00:23:01,463
Even in high school, I had friends
who couldn't wait to be moms.

448
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,171
But not me.

449
00:23:03,505 --> 00:23:05,880
- Shit, and now...
- She wants them more than you.

450
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,005
- And I want her more than the world.
- Mm.

451
00:23:10,755 --> 00:23:11,838
That's beautiful.

452
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,588
- [chuckles] Sounds like honey whiskey.
- "Heavy with mood."

453
00:23:16,755 --> 00:23:18,671
I know... What is that? I know that.

454
00:23:18,755 --> 00:23:21,546
- Ah, it's college lesbian music.
- [chuckles]

455
00:23:22,463 --> 00:23:24,255
I knew you were one of us.

456
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:27,838
- Go home, Ray.
- Good, and...

457
00:23:27,921 --> 00:23:30,421
- "And"? Ray, no...
- Advise everyone at the meeting

458
00:23:30,505 --> 00:23:33,463
they shouldn't put off till tomorrow
what they can do today.

459
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:35,255
What are you even talking about?

460
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,796
- What are you up to?
- Doing my job, Myra.

461
00:23:38,963 --> 00:23:40,296
I'd like to do my job.

462
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:42,463
It's a lockout, Ray.

463
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,005
Go home, hmm?

464
00:23:46,546 --> 00:23:47,546
Tell 'em. Just tell 'em.

465
00:23:50,255 --> 00:23:53,713
I come from a family where we don't...
It's really three of us -

466
00:23:53,796 --> 00:23:55,296
my mom, my sister, myself.

467
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,213
We don't really trust anybody.

468
00:23:57,296 --> 00:23:59,630
For... Rightfully so,
we don't trust anybody.

469
00:23:59,713 --> 00:24:01,963
We just stay within ourselves.

470
00:24:02,046 --> 00:24:04,338
And it's worked, you know,
for my whole life.

471
00:24:04,421 --> 00:24:05,838
And we met with...

472
00:24:07,296 --> 00:24:09,380
I wanna get this right,
maybe three agencies,

473
00:24:09,505 --> 00:24:12,630
you know, and the agency I'm with now,
CAA, was the first meeting,

474
00:24:12,755 --> 00:24:15,921
the longest meeting. I make jokes
all the time, it was, like, five hours,

475
00:24:16,005 --> 00:24:20,255
but, um, it just felt like I was at home,
you know.

476
00:24:20,338 --> 00:24:23,921
That's been the consistent... constant...
Consistent throughout my career,

477
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,796
you know,
Louisville felt like I was at home.

478
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,046
When I went to Brewster Academy
for high school, I felt at home,

479
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:31,963
like that home vibe
I can be comfortable with, you know?

480
00:24:37,255 --> 00:24:38,546
[men laughing]

481
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:42,046
- Hey, good to see you.
- You too.

482
00:24:52,338 --> 00:24:53,630
[elevator pings]

483
00:25:12,296 --> 00:25:13,463
[doors close]

484
00:25:19,838 --> 00:25:23,130
I'm the last person you want to be
trapped in the elevator with.

485
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,630
David.

486
00:25:26,713 --> 00:25:28,713
I was giving you a hard time in there.

487
00:25:29,713 --> 00:25:30,963
You can handle it.

488
00:25:31,838 --> 00:25:34,713
I like that they send you
to represent the big boys.

489
00:25:35,921 --> 00:25:36,921
"Boys"?

490
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:42,630
You headed someplace nice
this long weekend?

491
00:25:42,713 --> 00:25:43,921
We don't have to talk.

492
00:25:44,671 --> 00:25:47,713
I'm headed to Australia.
Not a moment too soon.

493
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,255
You're planning a weekend trip
to Australia?

494
00:25:50,713 --> 00:25:54,046
Well, I guess I don't have to spend
just the weekend anymore, do I?

495
00:25:55,296 --> 00:25:57,046
You weren't planning to be here.

496
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,671
Our youngest is dating a reef specialist,
wants us to meet him.

497
00:26:03,255 --> 00:26:04,546
I think it'll be nice.

498
00:26:05,671 --> 00:26:08,546
- You believe in family, don't you, Myra?
- Tch.

499
00:26:09,005 --> 00:26:11,213
You should go somewhere nice with yours.

500
00:26:11,838 --> 00:26:14,505
I'm supposed to be here
in case negotiations...

501
00:26:14,713 --> 00:26:17,546
You know, the Players Association
could sue your ass.

502
00:26:18,588 --> 00:26:19,588
For?

503
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,921
You weren't negotiating in good faith.

504
00:26:22,421 --> 00:26:23,505
Neither were you.

505
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,380
- You don't seem surprised.
- I'm not.

506
00:26:42,296 --> 00:26:44,755
- I got your address from the off...
- You're my assistant.

507
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,338
- Former.
- They wipe your memory or something?

508
00:26:49,421 --> 00:26:51,880
I guess I'm just saying
you don't seem <i>that </i>upset.

509
00:26:52,338 --> 00:26:53,338
I'm not. I need you.

510
00:26:56,088 --> 00:26:57,755
I'm glad you finally see that.

511
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,421
Okay, look, Sam...

512
00:27:02,505 --> 00:27:04,713
you were a really great assistant, okay?

513
00:27:05,255 --> 00:27:08,005
But please stop whining because
I didn't pay you special attention.

514
00:27:08,088 --> 00:27:09,963
Now, I know there are people

515
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:12,630
who buy their personal assistants gifts
and whatnot,

516
00:27:12,713 --> 00:27:14,713
but it's really because
they hate their assistants.

517
00:27:14,796 --> 00:27:16,880
But they need 'em so they buy 'em things.

518
00:27:17,588 --> 00:27:20,921
I told you you were indispensable,
now you want me to say sorry - for what?

519
00:27:21,005 --> 00:27:23,213
Not remembering your birthday
or your last name?

520
00:27:23,296 --> 00:27:25,046
I mean, what is this? Date two?

521
00:27:27,588 --> 00:27:28,755
Well, thank you.

522
00:27:30,838 --> 00:27:31,878
For what? "Indispensable."

523
00:27:34,421 --> 00:27:35,463
Tch. Ah... [he sighs]

524
00:27:39,338 --> 00:27:40,421
Don't thank me yet.

525
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,671
Come on, inside.

526
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:45,463
[Sam] <i>You know I chose you.</i>

527
00:27:47,255 --> 00:27:48,546
- "Chose me"?
- Mmhmm.

528
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,380
I graduated top of my class

529
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:54,380
and I came in entry level,
so that I could work with you.

530
00:27:54,755 --> 00:27:55,921
I knew you were a hard-ass

531
00:27:56,005 --> 00:27:59,380
and everybody else knew you already
had old-man tendencies at almost 40.

532
00:27:59,463 --> 00:28:02,421
- Hey, watch that "four word," lady.
- [chuckles]

533
00:28:02,755 --> 00:28:03,755
Yeah, well...

534
00:28:05,421 --> 00:28:07,130
you do it for the right reasons.

535
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:13,546
I know you'd never admit it,
but you lean into it and the work shows.

536
00:28:15,171 --> 00:28:17,255
Yeah. Not lately.

537
00:28:19,088 --> 00:28:21,755
Yeah, well, 'cause the problem is
we've run out of story.

538
00:28:21,838 --> 00:28:22,838
"Story"?

539
00:28:23,588 --> 00:28:24,713
What's the story here?

540
00:28:25,796 --> 00:28:27,463
Remember that Paul Meghan thing?

541
00:28:28,046 --> 00:28:30,213
When he was caught
publicly punishing his daughter

542
00:28:30,296 --> 00:28:32,046
and everybody thought he was done?

543
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:36,005
But then you leaked that video
of him crying at his daughter's recital

544
00:28:36,088 --> 00:28:38,880
and that changed everything
and <i>that </i>became the story?

545
00:28:40,213 --> 00:28:41,713
We need to get at Erick Scott.

546
00:28:42,296 --> 00:28:45,005
"Get <i>at </i>him"? You mean, like...

547
00:28:45,338 --> 00:28:47,546
Wait, what? No!

548
00:28:47,796 --> 00:28:48,963
What is wrong with you?

549
00:28:49,838 --> 00:28:52,296
No. I'm talking about activate him.

550
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,296
Like... what story's gonna activate Erick?

551
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,005
We gotta get a game goin'.

552
00:29:03,671 --> 00:29:05,630
[man over PA] <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

553
00:29:05,713 --> 00:29:08,546
<i>our next station stop -
Philadelphia 30th Street Station.</i>

554
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:11,671
<i>If you're leaving us,
check you have all your belongings.</i>

555
00:29:11,755 --> 00:29:12,880
<i>As you exit the train,</i>

556
00:29:12,963 --> 00:29:15,255
<i>mind the gap between the train
and the station's platform.</i>

557
00:29:15,338 --> 00:29:18,463
<i>Thank you for choosing our train.
Philadelphia 30th Street Station is next.</i>

558
00:29:18,546 --> 00:29:20,005
<i>Have a pleasant afternoon.</i>

559
00:29:24,338 --> 00:29:26,630
[Ray] <i>You have a lovely home.</i>

560
00:29:28,005 --> 00:29:29,463
Not what you were expecting?

561
00:29:30,546 --> 00:29:31,546
Pardon?

562
00:29:31,963 --> 00:29:33,005
When you walked up.

563
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:34,880
You stopped, looked around.

564
00:29:35,796 --> 00:29:38,130
Guess you thought we were
one of <i>those </i>stories.

565
00:29:38,713 --> 00:29:41,463
Boy has hoop dream,
mother pushes him to succeed

566
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:42,921
so he can buy her a house.

567
00:29:43,005 --> 00:29:44,213
Oh, no, I didn't.

568
00:29:45,171 --> 00:29:47,296
I already have a house.
Don't need a house.

569
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,296
- A very lovely one.
- Mm-hmm.

570
00:29:50,838 --> 00:29:51,838
Ms. Umber... Mrs.

571
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,171
Uh... Emera...

572
00:29:54,255 --> 00:29:56,546
"Mrs" is fine. You believe in God?

573
00:29:57,505 --> 00:29:59,588
Um... Well, I was raised Baptist.

574
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,880
But from whom do you draw your strength?

575
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,130
God?

576
00:30:06,921 --> 00:30:08,963
You scared I'ma ask you to recite a verse?

577
00:30:10,213 --> 00:30:12,088
- "Jesus wept."
- Oh...

578
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,046
Mmhmm. [Chuckles]

579
00:30:16,296 --> 00:30:19,005
Well, Mr. Burke, I believe in God.

580
00:30:19,796 --> 00:30:23,005
And not the "He is everywhere"
Creator version in your mind.

581
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:26,005
The God who asks for obedience.

582
00:30:26,088 --> 00:30:28,588
- Hey, hell is a place.
- Indeed!

583
00:30:30,338 --> 00:30:32,671
And I intend my sons
to know heaven here,

584
00:30:32,838 --> 00:30:33,921
in this world.

585
00:30:34,088 --> 00:30:36,921
They have the opportunity
to do that right here.

586
00:30:37,088 --> 00:30:40,505
They have the skill, the charm, the drive

587
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,880
to be the best in this world.

588
00:30:44,171 --> 00:30:47,421
And they don't drink or smoke
or any of those other natural afflictions

589
00:30:47,505 --> 00:30:49,005
- that can halt a man.
- Right.

590
00:30:49,796 --> 00:30:52,380
And I think they should be
compensated for it.

591
00:30:52,463 --> 00:30:55,296
Gospel of Prosperity! Amen!

592
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:57,755
But, again, it's not about me.

593
00:30:57,963 --> 00:31:00,963
- I don't want their money. It's theirs.
- Oh, I hear you.

594
00:31:01,505 --> 00:31:02,588
No, you don't.

595
00:31:03,171 --> 00:31:05,713
If you did, you'd get up
and go on on from here.

596
00:31:07,671 --> 00:31:10,963
Mrs. Umber, I want to speak with you
about an oppor...

597
00:31:11,046 --> 00:31:13,588
About repping Jamero Umber.

598
00:31:13,921 --> 00:31:16,588
[Ray] Uh... Yes, but in a different way.

599
00:31:16,713 --> 00:31:18,921
I already manage Jayvier.

600
00:31:19,005 --> 00:31:21,005
He's in the NFL,
since we're in a lockout...

601
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:24,171
Oh, please! I see old white men

602
00:31:24,255 --> 00:31:27,505
and young hoteps trying
to rise up off my baby, same play.

603
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:30,630
I'm the manager. Agent.

604
00:31:31,005 --> 00:31:32,005
All.

605
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,130
And you ought to be ashamed of yourself,

606
00:31:36,213 --> 00:31:38,796
trying to cash in on somebody
during the lockout.

607
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,130
What?

608
00:31:40,796 --> 00:31:43,880
Erick Scott ain't working out
like you thought, is he?

609
00:31:49,005 --> 00:31:50,005
[chuckles] Well...

610
00:31:53,713 --> 00:31:56,130
you can't have a percent
of my baby's earnings.

611
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,838
I'm an old school accountant with Bell.

612
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,963
I know how to pay they taxes.

613
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:06,880
I want sweeping exclusive deals
that match their worth

614
00:32:07,046 --> 00:32:10,088
and that can be jettisoned
if the brand becomes unfit.

615
00:32:10,213 --> 00:32:11,713
I can negotiate that.

616
00:32:12,505 --> 00:32:14,588
And if I can't, I have a lawyer that can

617
00:32:14,921 --> 00:32:17,338
and he's paid by my
and my husband's trust.

618
00:32:17,463 --> 00:32:19,630
So, Mr. Burke...

619
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:21,171
Ray...

620
00:32:21,505 --> 00:32:22,838
we do not need you.

621
00:32:25,213 --> 00:32:27,921
I appreciate you coming to Philly
to see me, though.

622
00:32:28,005 --> 00:32:31,796
Gives me a great idea of what kind
of company the competition keeps.

623
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:38,255
Great.

624
00:32:40,046 --> 00:32:41,046
Where you been?

625
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,046
- You smell like drink. I need a drink.
- [Ray] Philly.

626
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,505
- Philly?
- Yep.

627
00:32:45,921 --> 00:32:47,721
And I'll tell you why
when you turn on your TV

628
00:32:47,796 --> 00:32:50,880
and tell me that you've accepted
Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior.

629
00:32:50,963 --> 00:32:54,338
- [laughs] What are you talkin' about?
- What happened with Seton?

630
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,880
God.

631
00:32:56,255 --> 00:32:58,421
David Seton is the Lord Voldemort
of owners.

632
00:32:58,505 --> 00:33:00,505
- Lord...?
- The Dark Lord.

633
00:33:00,588 --> 00:33:02,505
Harry... Walder Frey.

634
00:33:02,588 --> 00:33:04,963
- GOT I know.
- I'm sitting in this meeting yesterday

635
00:33:05,046 --> 00:33:07,130
when I should be home, comforting my wife.

636
00:33:07,755 --> 00:33:10,005
- We're still in the lockout?
- Fuck you.

637
00:33:10,296 --> 00:33:12,588
- I'm just making sure.
- Yes. Yes, we are.

638
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,213
And I thought we would be.

639
00:33:16,505 --> 00:33:18,671
I thought I was just dealing
with hard-ass businessmen

640
00:33:18,755 --> 00:33:21,171
who didn't want to give their players
proportionate pay.

641
00:33:21,296 --> 00:33:24,255
Fuck, that's what unions and businessmen
have been fighting for since...

642
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:25,338
Slavery?

643
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:28,130
- Yes!
- I love the Lord and all His black people.

644
00:33:28,213 --> 00:33:29,921
What are you even saying?

645
00:33:30,421 --> 00:33:31,421
I'm listening.

646
00:33:32,213 --> 00:33:33,796
- We're being played, Ray.
- Yeah.

647
00:33:34,005 --> 00:33:37,630
The owners galvanized by
that wet spot Seton from what I can tell.

648
00:33:38,171 --> 00:33:39,588
They're holding onto this lockout

649
00:33:39,671 --> 00:33:41,713
so they can renegotiate terms
with the networks.

650
00:33:42,213 --> 00:33:44,421
- Those contracts expire.
- They expired last week.

651
00:33:44,505 --> 00:33:46,255
- I know, I checked.
- Lawsuit?

652
00:33:47,005 --> 00:33:47,838
For what?

653
00:33:47,921 --> 00:33:50,171
I can't prove any of this shit.
I just know.

654
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,755
They'll probably settle with the networks
in a couple of weeks for bazillions

655
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,671
and then agree to some weak-ass form
of 0.5% increase

656
00:33:58,755 --> 00:34:01,463
- every five years over 20 years and...
- So, it's a month.

657
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:05,046
- It's another month.
- In baby time, that's a lot.

658
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,810
- Don't start.
- A lot of guys not prepared

659
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,755
- for a full six-month strike.
- I know.

660
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,088
Players'll probably cave
before the network deal's done,

661
00:34:11,171 --> 00:34:13,796
- the owners won't have to agree to shit.
- Fuck, I <i>know.</i>

662
00:34:14,505 --> 00:34:15,505
We gotta stop 'em.

663
00:34:16,671 --> 00:34:18,255
Why are you talking like that?

664
00:34:19,713 --> 00:34:21,046
What are you looking at?

665
00:34:23,296 --> 00:34:24,296
Turn it up.

666
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,796
[man]<i> Oh, man, this is getting crazy!</i>

667
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,463
<i>Jamero Umber and Erick Scott
seem to be going at it in public,</i>

668
00:34:32,546 --> 00:34:34,463
<i>calling each other out on Twitter.</i>

669
00:34:34,546 --> 00:34:38,505
<i>You never wanna make these things public,
but these guys have,</i>

670
00:34:38,588 --> 00:34:41,380
<i>taking issue with each other's lifestyles
and doing it all</i>

671
00:34:41,463 --> 00:34:43,255
- <i>in a hundred-odd characters.</i>
- Oh, no, Ray!

672
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:46,838
- What have you done?
<i>- Seems Jamero's having problems...</i>

673
00:34:46,921 --> 00:34:50,713
Sometimes everyone bumps heads.
It's just like anyone at work, you know.

674
00:34:50,796 --> 00:34:53,880
You may bump heads with your co-worker
from time to time,

675
00:34:53,963 --> 00:34:56,588
but for me, as a teammate,

676
00:34:56,671 --> 00:34:58,713
I always remind each other,
you know, all of us,

677
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:02,005
that we're teammates, you know,
we're family. We're in this together.

678
00:35:02,088 --> 00:35:03,796
I'm not here not only...

679
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,713
I'm not here just to be here for myself,
I'm here to help everyone.

680
00:35:07,796 --> 00:35:10,921
You know, I'd rather have somebody
talk about me to my face

681
00:35:11,005 --> 00:35:13,421
rather than talk about me to...
Behind my back

682
00:35:13,505 --> 00:35:16,046
or sub-tweet and I have to guess
what you're trying to say

683
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:19,630
rather than we just air it out
and we figure it out amongst the family

684
00:35:19,713 --> 00:35:22,921
and, you know, we're happy to go do it
in front of everybody else

685
00:35:23,005 --> 00:35:25,338
and find a way to keep moving
in the right direction.

686
00:35:25,421 --> 00:35:29,255
You're never off the clock.
That's one thing that I know.

687
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:32,796
You're always on the clock.
You could be at home, anywhere.

688
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,880
With the technology now,
anybody needs to pick up with a soundbite

689
00:35:35,963 --> 00:35:38,463
and put your name behind it,
even if it's not true,

690
00:35:38,546 --> 00:35:40,671
you make headlines,
so that's the one thing I learned.

691
00:35:40,755 --> 00:35:43,505
[Erick] I don't know why that dude came
at me like that.

692
00:35:43,588 --> 00:35:44,921
[Sam] Why? Are you scared?

693
00:35:45,213 --> 00:35:49,880
Hell, no! It's just... Just whatever.
It's just some of that stuff ain't right.

694
00:35:51,421 --> 00:35:52,421
Come on.

695
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:57,463
I'm deadass. If I got some shit to say,
I'ma say it straight to a nig... a dude.

696
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:00,630
I'ma say it to a dude's face.
Don't need no tweets.

697
00:36:00,713 --> 00:36:02,713
But everybody says that
then their shit goes viral,

698
00:36:02,796 --> 00:36:04,963
then they're like,
"Oh, no, that wasn't me."

699
00:36:05,046 --> 00:36:06,046
But it wasn't. [Laughs]

700
00:36:08,338 --> 00:36:09,880
Okay. But is it true?

701
00:36:10,796 --> 00:36:11,796
What?

702
00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:13,505
Are you better than him?

703
00:36:15,046 --> 00:36:17,505
You're both signed with New York,
both wanna play, but...

704
00:36:17,713 --> 00:36:19,421
Are you better than Jamero?

705
00:36:20,046 --> 00:36:21,338
Look, put it like this.

706
00:36:21,796 --> 00:36:24,130
There's street ball
and there's organized ball.

707
00:36:24,213 --> 00:36:26,630
Me and this cat's supposed to be
on the same team.

708
00:36:26,713 --> 00:36:29,353
If it weren't for the lockout,
we'd be in training together, but...

709
00:36:30,921 --> 00:36:32,296
He plays organized ball.

710
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,755
I'm from the streets.
I know iso, one-on-one.

711
00:36:36,213 --> 00:36:39,671
Take the clock off, till 21,
I'll light his ass up any day.

712
00:36:39,755 --> 00:36:41,171
[laughs]

713
00:36:42,671 --> 00:36:46,838
- "Light... his... ass... up..."
- Whoa, girl, what you doin'?

714
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:50,338
- Whoa! I'm grown as fuck.
- Okay, lady, why you send that?

715
00:36:50,421 --> 00:36:51,921
Because you said it's true!

716
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:55,755
You wanted Ray to help you
make a statement that was true

717
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,963
- and didn't sound confrontational.
- Ray. You're not Ray.

718
00:36:59,505 --> 00:37:00,505
You're right.

719
00:37:01,005 --> 00:37:02,630
And I don't work for him either.

720
00:37:03,546 --> 00:37:05,046
Wait, since when?

721
00:37:06,171 --> 00:37:08,213
Yo, Jamero's talkin' mad shit about you!

722
00:37:08,296 --> 00:37:09,796
No, his mom was.

723
00:37:09,921 --> 00:37:12,713
Yeah, but you can't say anything
about his mama, so...

724
00:37:14,255 --> 00:37:15,630
Look, I was hacked earlier.

725
00:37:16,046 --> 00:37:18,838
They was talkin' about how I was chillin'
and slackin' during the lockout

726
00:37:18,921 --> 00:37:20,838
and they hope I be ready
if the game came back

727
00:37:20,921 --> 00:37:23,463
'cause I'm just support for Jamero.
Like, tha fuck?

728
00:37:24,088 --> 00:37:26,505
Yeah, you wrote that, too.
"Tha fuck?" [laughs]

729
00:37:26,588 --> 00:37:28,838
That's me, that's how I talk. That was me.

730
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:33,713
Okay, so you didn't say,
"Get that wet nurse off your timeline"?

731
00:37:33,796 --> 00:37:35,421
No, see, that's not how I talk.

732
00:37:35,505 --> 00:37:37,546
That's corny,
I don't even know what that mean.

733
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:41,380
So, did it make you mad that they were,
like, "You're just the backup"?

734
00:37:42,005 --> 00:37:43,713
- Yeah.
- "You're a bench player"?

735
00:37:43,796 --> 00:37:45,005
I was heated 'bout that.

736
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:49,588
Oh, so you did say,
"Jamero so drunk off that mama's milk,

737
00:37:49,713 --> 00:37:52,130
now he lookin' for a spanking
from his daddy."

738
00:37:52,213 --> 00:37:55,421
No, see, but I'm startin' to wish I did.

739
00:37:56,005 --> 00:37:57,088
Why didn't you?

740
00:37:58,171 --> 00:37:59,921
- You scared?
- No.

741
00:38:00,713 --> 00:38:01,713
Look...

742
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:05,880
like I said, I make the rim shake and move
with my fury.

743
00:38:07,088 --> 00:38:08,338
Mm-kay!

744
00:38:09,671 --> 00:38:14,088
"Shake and move with the fury...

745
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,505
of my discontent."

746
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,088
See, that's good.

747
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,838
- It's cute.
- There go Ray right there.

748
00:38:20,921 --> 00:38:22,255
[horn honking]

749
00:38:23,088 --> 00:38:24,088
[Sam] Hey!

750
00:38:28,255 --> 00:38:30,338
- [Erick] <i>But we had no choice.</i>
- [Ray] <i>"We"?</i>

751
00:38:30,671 --> 00:38:33,255
[Erick] <i>I mean, Sam ain't really...</i>
<i>It was all me.</i>

752
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:37,171
I did it, you know?
Fuck homes and his fam.

753
00:38:37,255 --> 00:38:40,255
[Ray] That is your teammate, sir.
That will be your teammate.

754
00:38:40,338 --> 00:38:43,505
You don't think the coach,
the team's management or David Seton

755
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:46,213
are gonna pay attention
to its star players bickering

756
00:38:46,296 --> 00:38:47,921
before the game is even back on?

757
00:38:48,046 --> 00:38:50,686
- [Erick] If the game ever get back on.
- What did I just tell you?

758
00:38:51,588 --> 00:38:53,046
[Erick] Look, Ray, I'm sorry.

759
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,880
[Ray] That act's getting a bit tired,

760
00:38:54,963 --> 00:38:57,338
especially since
it's not bringing in any money.

761
00:38:57,796 --> 00:39:01,755
- [Erick] So you <i>do </i>worry about the money?
- [Ray] You funny. You funny, man.

762
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:04,546
You got bad press
without stepping foot on the court,

763
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,671
but you got jokes.

764
00:39:06,296 --> 00:39:07,296
And you...

765
00:39:08,005 --> 00:39:09,005
What?

766
00:39:09,505 --> 00:39:11,421
He called to schedule an appointment.

767
00:39:12,005 --> 00:39:14,296
Did you tell him
you're no longer my assistant?

768
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,838
Well, I was going to,
but when he told me why,

769
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:19,630
I figured you'd want
to have this discussion in person.

770
00:39:21,046 --> 00:39:22,046
Listen,

771
00:39:22,463 --> 00:39:24,463
all you had to do was say, "No comment."

772
00:39:24,546 --> 00:39:27,088
Emera Umber's just tweeting
from her son's account,

773
00:39:27,171 --> 00:39:29,088
trying to get you hyped. Just say no.

774
00:39:33,421 --> 00:39:35,921
- Yo, Ray, this you and Gavin Burke?
- [Sam] Yeah.

775
00:39:36,421 --> 00:39:37,505
[Ray] Thank you, Ray.

776
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:40,838
Isn't this the envelope I gave you?
Why are you carrying it around?

777
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:44,046
- Thought it might be a good time to open...
- [Ray] It's not. You'll know.

778
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:46,213
Okay. Yo, you used to rep buddy, right?

779
00:39:46,296 --> 00:39:48,963
[Sam] Yeah, he was his first client.
He brought him to SAV.

780
00:39:49,046 --> 00:39:51,380
- [Ray] Can we all just...
- [Sam] I'm right, right?

781
00:39:51,463 --> 00:39:52,588
He was your brother?

782
00:39:53,046 --> 00:39:54,046
[Ray] Cousin.

783
00:39:54,463 --> 00:39:56,338
I never made that connection, fam.

784
00:39:57,171 --> 00:39:58,421
Yo, buddy die, right?

785
00:39:59,005 --> 00:40:01,171
Yes, Erick, he's dead. We good?

786
00:40:02,088 --> 00:40:03,208
[Erick] My bad. Was it hard?

787
00:40:05,338 --> 00:40:07,255
[sighs] Man, what are you talking...

788
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:16,088
Let me check the temperature for you.
We have not heard from New York.

789
00:40:16,505 --> 00:40:19,505
They haven't hit us up,
haven't said anything about the beef.

790
00:40:19,588 --> 00:40:22,088
That's good, it gives us
a minute to recalibrate.

791
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:25,171
You did go down the rabbit hole
with Alice and the Dormouse,

792
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:26,963
but it's cool 'cause you back now.

793
00:40:27,088 --> 00:40:28,546
So, let's put our heads together

794
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,710
and figure out how
we can get in front of this thing.

795
00:40:34,005 --> 00:40:35,088
Who you calling?

796
00:40:36,546 --> 00:40:38,046
It's time for you to go home.

797
00:40:43,255 --> 00:40:47,005
[Myra] <i>It's a free country still, I think,</i>
<i>or at least there's an illusion of one.</i>

798
00:40:47,588 --> 00:40:49,296
[Ray] <i>That's your legal advice?</i>

799
00:40:49,755 --> 00:40:51,296
I'm headed home, Ray.

800
00:40:52,171 --> 00:40:55,296
But yes. No, he's not scabbing

801
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,796
if he wants to shoot the ball around
with neighborhood kids

802
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,046
and take a couple questions
from the press about it.

803
00:41:00,255 --> 00:41:02,671
<i>Thank you, Myra.
Tell Caroline I said hello and...</i>

804
00:41:02,755 --> 00:41:04,046
I will.

805
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:06,296
<i>Stop by the court if you get bored.</i>

806
00:41:07,421 --> 00:41:09,546
Thank you, but I won't get that bored.

807
00:41:12,713 --> 00:41:13,713
Thanks.

808
00:41:14,463 --> 00:41:16,713
You're welcome.
So, what you 'bout to do?

809
00:41:17,421 --> 00:41:19,171
- Nothing.
- Wanna hang out?

810
00:41:20,421 --> 00:41:21,421
Okay.

811
00:41:22,171 --> 00:41:23,671
- [Erick] It's not.
- Yes, it is.

812
00:41:23,755 --> 00:41:25,213
- You wouldn't know.
- I'd know.

813
00:41:25,338 --> 00:41:28,671
[Donovan] <i>Well, I think the first thing</i>
<i>is just being more efficient.</i>

814
00:41:28,755 --> 00:41:31,963
You know, it kinda goes back to being
that rookie that's all over the place.

815
00:41:32,046 --> 00:41:34,213
There are moments where I felt
I was out of control,

816
00:41:34,296 --> 00:41:36,713
shooting shots that are, like,
"What are you doing?"

817
00:41:36,796 --> 00:41:38,213
But you're just out of control.

818
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:41,213
It's my first year
so I'm learning and making mistakes.

819
00:41:41,796 --> 00:41:43,171
It's not as easy as it sounds.

820
00:41:43,255 --> 00:41:46,838
You're not just given a boatload of money,
like the old-school cartoons.

821
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,588
You're not given a roomful of gold coins

822
00:41:48,671 --> 00:41:51,005
and you get to dive off a diving board
and swim in it.

823
00:41:51,088 --> 00:41:53,505
[Reggie] That's one thing I'll say -
90% mental.

824
00:41:53,588 --> 00:41:55,838
Once you get to this level,
everybody has the talent.

825
00:41:55,921 --> 00:41:59,380
It's really about unlocking your mental,
unlocking your confidence,

826
00:41:59,505 --> 00:42:01,880
um, learning how to deal with your vices.

827
00:42:01,963 --> 00:42:02,963
[whistle blows]

828
00:42:03,046 --> 00:42:06,213
- [woman] You got it, girl. Come on.
- [woman 2] Keep going, guys.

829
00:42:06,296 --> 00:42:07,505
[boy 1] She's open!

830
00:42:12,088 --> 00:42:14,255
[boy 2] Come on,
you gotta find your light-skin light.

831
00:42:14,338 --> 00:42:16,421
- [Ray] Wait, what?
- Your light-skin light.

832
00:42:16,505 --> 00:42:18,838
You move around
until the light's in your eyes

833
00:42:18,921 --> 00:42:20,561
and you gotta squint because it's windy -

834
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,590
that's how you know
you got your light-skin light.

835
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:24,911
And don't worry,
all the filters work on light-skin light.

836
00:42:24,963 --> 00:42:28,755
And then all you've got to do is,
you know, act light-skin.

837
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:29,963
And how's that?

838
00:42:30,046 --> 00:42:31,880
Like LL. Lick your lips.

839
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:35,463
- Quincy Brown pucker?
- What?

840
00:42:35,546 --> 00:42:37,546
- Kardashian scowl.
- Chris Brown smirk.

841
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,380
What's dark-skin light?

842
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,838
[both] Eggplant Fridays!

843
00:42:40,921 --> 00:42:42,588
- Come on, man!
- Get it together!

844
00:42:42,755 --> 00:42:45,838
Darius. Freddy. Focus.

845
00:42:45,921 --> 00:42:48,721
- Pay attention.
- We was just... You don't own this court, Mr. Spence.

846
00:42:54,671 --> 00:42:56,421
From the start of practice,

847
00:42:57,171 --> 00:42:59,171
till y'all little Twitter asses go home,

848
00:42:59,963 --> 00:43:01,088
I own you, son.

849
00:43:02,463 --> 00:43:03,505
Wait, was that...

850
00:43:03,588 --> 00:43:05,296
[all] A slavery reference?

851
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,963
[Ray]<i> Where are you?</i>

852
00:43:07,546 --> 00:43:09,546
I don't work for you anymore.

853
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:13,213
[Ray] <i>I know that. Why do you keep...</i>
<i>Look, is Erick with you or not?</i>

854
00:43:13,296 --> 00:43:16,713
Yes, he's right here.
Do you want to speak with him?

855
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:18,380
<i>I'd like for y'all to be here.</i>

856
00:43:18,463 --> 00:43:20,630
<i>I told Spence
you'd be here 30 minutes ago.</i>

857
00:43:21,005 --> 00:43:24,213
Okay, yeah, I know, but we had, like,
a wardrobe malfunction.

858
00:43:24,463 --> 00:43:26,088
<i>Please just get here.</i>

859
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:28,963
All right, okay. Bye!

860
00:43:30,713 --> 00:43:32,630
Jesus Christ!

861
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,046
So, who's gonna tell him?

862
00:43:36,005 --> 00:43:37,338
I don't kiss and tell.

863
00:43:38,171 --> 00:43:39,630
[chuckles] Seriously?

864
00:43:39,755 --> 00:43:41,963
I'm deadass. This our business, right?

865
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:44,588
Ray don't need to know
what happened between us.

866
00:43:45,296 --> 00:43:47,296
Okay, I guess you're right.

867
00:43:48,796 --> 00:43:51,588
No reason to talk about it
if it's not gonna happen again, right?

868
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:52,671
Right.

869
00:43:53,171 --> 00:43:54,171
Wait, what?

870
00:43:54,796 --> 00:43:57,088
[Spence] Every year, we have this day

871
00:43:58,005 --> 00:44:00,505
to celebrate or at least commemorate

872
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:04,713
those who balled before.

873
00:44:05,921 --> 00:44:10,088
We bring our young players out and talk
to them about the game and how it started.

874
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,130
The reason there is a pro league is
because we had a league of our own before

875
00:44:16,213 --> 00:44:20,088
that was good for us and our community.

876
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,421
We gave that up for...

877
00:44:23,463 --> 00:44:24,546
more money.

878
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,171
So, like, today,

879
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:30,255
like you are doing,

880
00:44:31,005 --> 00:44:33,296
my players don't usually listen to me.

881
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,255
But usually,

882
00:44:36,671 --> 00:44:41,171
players from the major teams
come out to talk to our players

883
00:44:41,338 --> 00:44:44,796
and sign autographs,
but since the lockout, I guess...

884
00:44:45,255 --> 00:44:49,296
I'm guessing
that they're at home or in Florida,

885
00:44:50,046 --> 00:44:52,963
where they claim properties for...

886
00:44:54,338 --> 00:44:55,421
tax breaks.

887
00:44:56,838 --> 00:44:57,838
But...

888
00:44:58,671 --> 00:45:00,088
with us today,

889
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:05,213
to celebrate the street ball
that made him,

890
00:45:06,713 --> 00:45:09,463
is the number-one draft pick,

891
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:11,796
Mr. Erick Scott.

892
00:45:12,796 --> 00:45:14,796
[applause]

893
00:45:20,963 --> 00:45:23,546
But before we hear from Erick,

894
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,213
I would like to call up...

895
00:45:27,463 --> 00:45:29,005
his agent and friend,

896
00:45:30,005 --> 00:45:31,338
Mr. Ray Burke.

897
00:45:31,421 --> 00:45:32,838
- Ray, come on up.
- [applause]

898
00:45:32,921 --> 00:45:33,963
Come on, Ray.

899
00:45:34,755 --> 00:45:35,755
Come on, Ray.

900
00:45:38,421 --> 00:45:39,713
You got this, brother.

901
00:45:40,588 --> 00:45:41,588
You got it.

902
00:45:46,921 --> 00:45:48,005
How y'all doing?

903
00:45:48,463 --> 00:45:49,463
[kids] Good.

904
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:51,296
I said, how y'all doing?

905
00:45:51,421 --> 00:45:53,755
- Good.
- All right. [Chuckles]

906
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:56,171
Well, um...

907
00:45:57,546 --> 00:46:01,171
Listen, y'all might notice that things
are a little different this year.

908
00:46:01,713 --> 00:46:05,546
No cameras out here,
just a few journalists from the papers.

909
00:46:08,088 --> 00:46:10,546
And since we got a little time...

910
00:46:11,713 --> 00:46:15,963
and Spence asked me to say something
to the youth, I guess I'll speak on it.

911
00:46:16,171 --> 00:46:17,296
Is that all right?

912
00:46:17,421 --> 00:46:19,088
- [kids] Yeah.
- [Ray] Is that all right?

913
00:46:19,171 --> 00:46:20,671
- [kids] Yeah!
- [Ray] All right.

914
00:46:20,755 --> 00:46:21,796
[chuckles]

915
00:46:22,671 --> 00:46:25,671
You know, I'm not from where y'all from.

916
00:46:26,838 --> 00:46:28,963
This neighborhood's where most of y'all
come from, yeah?

917
00:46:29,046 --> 00:46:30,671
- [kids] Yeah.
- Yeah.

918
00:46:31,463 --> 00:46:34,088
Well, it didn't look like this
when I was your age.

919
00:46:35,463 --> 00:46:38,880
It looked more like the town
that my people are from, my cousin..

920
00:46:40,421 --> 00:46:41,421
Is from.

921
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:48,588
You know, I used to, uh...

922
00:46:49,463 --> 00:46:51,921
used to visit him every year
in Jacksonville.

923
00:46:53,505 --> 00:46:55,921
And we would, you know,
do what cousins do -

924
00:46:56,005 --> 00:46:59,005
play each other, dare each other
to get better every summer.

925
00:47:00,296 --> 00:47:02,088
Now, I kept my part of the bargain.

926
00:47:02,255 --> 00:47:05,588
He did too. See, his daddy helped him,
even though he never met him.

927
00:47:06,338 --> 00:47:09,046
My cousin had a growth spurt one summer.

928
00:47:10,421 --> 00:47:11,421
Yeah, man.

929
00:47:12,546 --> 00:47:15,505
I went back down there
the summer before high school and...

930
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:19,463
Gavin had done shot up to six-six!

931
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,963
A mango season, they called it.

932
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:26,005
"All you need is a mango season
and everything'll change."

933
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:28,505
And it did.

934
00:47:29,421 --> 00:47:32,255
Everybody was coming down there
to see him play.

935
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,630
Now, I guess this is the part where y'all
expecting me to say I was jealous.

936
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,630
Oh, I was.

937
00:47:40,671 --> 00:47:43,255
But not of him.
I couldn't be jealous of that fool.

938
00:47:44,421 --> 00:47:46,713
Nah, I was jealous of the cats
that got to play him.

939
00:47:52,046 --> 00:47:53,380
Gavin loved...

940
00:47:54,421 --> 00:47:55,546
<i>loved </i>this game.

941
00:47:57,671 --> 00:48:00,796
He was thankful to God for his height
and his talent and...

942
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,130
and then he lost all that.

943
00:48:07,421 --> 00:48:09,880
He lost that love
and then he left the game.

944
00:48:11,796 --> 00:48:12,921
He lost his life.

945
00:48:15,338 --> 00:48:16,921
Y'all don't lose that love.

946
00:48:18,546 --> 00:48:19,755
A'ight?

947
00:48:20,005 --> 00:48:21,130
Even if yo'...

948
00:48:21,963 --> 00:48:24,203
Even if yo' mango season ain't
come, won't come, passed,

949
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:29,463
hold onto that love.

950
00:48:30,963 --> 00:48:32,130
It'll get you through.

951
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,713
[Ray clears throat] Um...

952
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:44,255
But I want to introduce you all
to somebody

953
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,338
who hasn't lost that love and never will.

954
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,921
And even though
there's a bunch of talk going around

955
00:48:50,005 --> 00:48:52,505
about status on teams
and whatnot, fu... Um...

956
00:48:53,671 --> 00:48:55,130
[chuckling] Forget all that.

957
00:48:56,338 --> 00:48:59,963
Ain't no teams right now.
So, put your hands together and give it up

958
00:49:00,338 --> 00:49:02,463
for your Back Court king, Mr. Erick Scott!

959
00:49:03,005 --> 00:49:05,005
[applause, cheering]

960
00:49:06,713 --> 00:49:07,921
[boy] Woohoo!

961
00:49:08,296 --> 00:49:09,338
[boy 2] All right!

962
00:49:10,505 --> 00:49:12,630
So, your last year at LSU, did you know?

963
00:49:12,838 --> 00:49:13,963
You never know.

964
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:15,130
- He knew.
- He knew.

965
00:49:15,213 --> 00:49:18,213
- [Erick laughs]
- Yo, the girls in New Orleans sexy?

966
00:49:18,505 --> 00:49:20,046
[Erick] LSU in Baton Rouge.

967
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:21,796
[Darius] They sexy?

968
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,713
[Erick] Yeah, girls in college sexy,

969
00:49:23,796 --> 00:49:25,755
especially when Southern
right down the street.

970
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,671
[Freddy] HBC proximity - nice!

971
00:49:27,755 --> 00:49:29,915
- [Darius] Thanks. Appreciate it.
- [Erick] Yeah, dawg.

972
00:49:30,171 --> 00:49:31,296
[Darius] Excuse me.

973
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:35,088
Yo, that's Jamero Umber.

974
00:49:35,255 --> 00:49:36,838
- Oh, snap! Come on.
- Let's go check.

975
00:49:37,046 --> 00:49:39,421
- Hey, what's up, man? How you doing?
- How you?

976
00:49:39,505 --> 00:49:41,380
- Fine, thanks, man.
- How are you?

977
00:49:41,921 --> 00:49:42,921
What's up?

978
00:49:43,088 --> 00:49:44,588
[boy] Yo, get his autograph.

979
00:49:44,671 --> 00:49:46,671
[excited chattering]

980
00:49:46,755 --> 00:49:48,380
- [boy 2] Whoa!
- [boy 3] Wow!

981
00:49:49,088 --> 00:49:50,505
I didn't know he'd be coming!

982
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:10,130
[Erick] What's up, fam? Ma'am.

983
00:50:10,713 --> 00:50:12,005
What y'all doing over here?

984
00:50:12,546 --> 00:50:17,046
We came to support the young players.
This is a New York tradition every year.

985
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:22,130
All the top players come out to Spence's
for Back Court Day, right?

986
00:50:22,213 --> 00:50:23,213
[kids] Right.

987
00:50:23,505 --> 00:50:25,463
[Emera] This year should be no different.

988
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:28,421
This ain't every year
and your court in Philly.

989
00:50:29,046 --> 00:50:30,588
No. This my court now.

990
00:50:31,546 --> 00:50:33,005
Watch how you talk to Mother.

991
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:35,005
[snickers]
You call your moms "Mother"?

992
00:50:35,088 --> 00:50:36,380
- Yeah.
- You a weirdo, bro.

993
00:50:36,463 --> 00:50:38,255
- [kids laugh]
- Got a problem with that?

994
00:50:39,421 --> 00:50:41,838
You had all that slick shit
to say on Twitter, fam.

995
00:50:42,921 --> 00:50:44,046
Talk that slick shit now.

996
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,880
I was hacked.

997
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:48,130
[laughs] You <i>are </i>a hack.

998
00:50:48,755 --> 00:50:49,921
[kids] Oh!

999
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:51,380
We'll see on the court.

1000
00:50:51,963 --> 00:50:54,088
You on the court now, young bull.

1001
00:50:54,546 --> 00:50:55,546
[kids] Oh!

1002
00:50:55,921 --> 00:50:58,463
That's cute!
I mean a real game, though.

1003
00:50:58,546 --> 00:51:01,421
Mm... You're the one who said,
"Take the clock off."

1004
00:51:01,755 --> 00:51:04,463
One-on-one, you'd smoke somebody!

1005
00:51:05,463 --> 00:51:06,546
Well, here we are.

1006
00:51:07,296 --> 00:51:09,171
Come on. Protect this house!

1007
00:51:12,921 --> 00:51:14,921
I mean... Look, I...

1008
00:51:16,255 --> 00:51:17,380
I just had sex.

1009
00:51:17,671 --> 00:51:18,671
[kids] What?

1010
00:51:19,046 --> 00:51:20,130
[Emera] Excuse you?

1011
00:51:20,963 --> 00:51:23,296
Not with you...
Not with Moms... your mother...

1012
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,338
- I just told you, watch your mouth.
- Ray, get your boy.

1013
00:51:26,421 --> 00:51:28,421
- Watch it, mofo. Who you talking to?
- Be cool.

1014
00:51:28,505 --> 00:51:30,130
- I'm talking to <i>you.</i>
- What's up?

1015
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:32,171
- What's up?
- [Ray] Erick, just walk away, man.

1016
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,505
Walk away, boy.

1017
00:51:33,588 --> 00:51:34,755
[Erick snickers]

1018
00:51:36,296 --> 00:51:37,671
Yeah, keep laughing.

1019
00:51:37,755 --> 00:51:39,963
- What you gon' do, bro?
- Come on, man.

1020
00:51:40,255 --> 00:51:42,713
Come on, E. Scott. Come on, man.

1021
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:45,630
Nah. Give him the rock.

1022
00:51:47,171 --> 00:51:49,046
[kids gasp, groan]

1023
00:51:49,755 --> 00:51:51,380
You don't wanna do that.

1024
00:51:55,005 --> 00:51:57,005
[cheering]

1025
00:52:26,588 --> 00:52:27,588
[Seton groans]

1026
00:52:29,213 --> 00:52:30,296
[Seton sighs]

1027
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:34,380
Good girl.

1028
00:52:35,421 --> 00:52:36,505
That's a good girl.

1029
00:52:44,755 --> 00:52:46,338
- Your drink.
- Thank you.

1030
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:51,213
[Seton's wife] Who's ready to fly?
Are we ready to fly? Oh, yes!

1031
00:52:51,463 --> 00:52:52,713
Who's ready to fly?

1032
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,880
Are you ready to fly, baby girl?

1033
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:57,213
<i>[man on news]
No one knows how the game started.</i>

1034
00:52:57,296 --> 00:53:01,088
<i>You're seeing Erick Scott and Jamero Umber
at a charity event in New York City.</i>

1035
00:53:01,213 --> 00:53:02,588
<i>Tensions were already high</i>

1036
00:53:02,671 --> 00:53:05,713
<i>after going back and forth with each other
on social media.</i>

1037
00:53:05,963 --> 00:53:07,588
<i>The only reason we know about this game</i>

1038
00:53:07,671 --> 00:53:10,213
<i>is because
some kids that were there recorded it</i>

1039
00:53:10,296 --> 00:53:12,380
<i>and posted it online. Take a look.</i>

1040
00:53:12,755 --> 00:53:14,755
[indistinct cheering]

1041
00:53:16,255 --> 00:53:17,630
[groaning]

1042
00:53:18,755 --> 00:53:20,755
[excited screaming]

1043
00:53:25,171 --> 00:53:27,088
<i>We don't know
who actually won this game,</i>

1044
00:53:27,171 --> 00:53:30,255
<i>but there's a lot of people calling
wanting to see this video.</i>

1045
00:53:30,338 --> 00:53:32,796
<i>This is the match-up
everyone's been dying to see.</i>

1046
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,130
Only if you planned it.

1047
00:53:34,921 --> 00:53:35,921
Did you plan it?

1048
00:53:36,005 --> 00:53:38,963
Spence has had that event
every year since I was 19

1049
00:53:39,046 --> 00:53:40,588
so... Spence planned it.

1050
00:53:40,713 --> 00:53:41,838
Don't put that on me.

1051
00:53:41,921 --> 00:53:45,963
I called the team rosters
and nobody got back to me... but Ray.

1052
00:53:46,505 --> 00:53:48,671
- Who invited the Umbers?
- [Myra] Well, who...

1053
00:53:48,921 --> 00:53:51,796
You're not supposed to be here.
I don't represent you yet.

1054
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:53,255
I'm not supposed to see him.

1055
00:53:53,338 --> 00:53:56,088
I just want to know
what we might be up against legally.

1056
00:53:56,171 --> 00:53:59,880
- Well, to be fair, I'm not sure.
- [Sam] I mean, it was a charity event.

1057
00:54:01,046 --> 00:54:04,296
You and Jamero, you're private citizens
that were <i>asked </i>to come to that event.

1058
00:54:04,796 --> 00:54:06,296
There were no officials there.

1059
00:54:06,671 --> 00:54:08,880
There weren't even any rules,
or you woulda lost.

1060
00:54:08,963 --> 00:54:10,463
Oh, man.

1061
00:54:10,546 --> 00:54:12,171
How come we don't know who won?

1062
00:54:12,588 --> 00:54:14,171
[Erick] Ray stopped the game.

1063
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:16,796
- Wait, why?
- [Ray] They don't need bad blood.

1064
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:20,588
This lockout will end eventually
and they gotta be on the same team

1065
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,296
so, right when they were tied...

1066
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:24,838
He held the ball like a spoiled schoolboy.

1067
00:54:25,088 --> 00:54:27,755
- [Myra] Or a smart salesman.
- Hey, what you mad about?

1068
00:54:28,213 --> 00:54:31,005
We had a bigger crowd,
we coulda sold more raffle tickets.

1069
00:54:31,088 --> 00:54:34,296
Uh-uh. No, you couldn't have.
That's what I've been telling you.

1070
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:37,505
If you knew they were coming
and you knew they might play,

1071
00:54:37,963 --> 00:54:41,755
Erick has an NBA contract. He's signed.
The contract was already in play.

1072
00:54:42,463 --> 00:54:44,046
You know that message they play

1073
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:46,463
at the beginning
of every basketball game on TV?

1074
00:54:46,921 --> 00:54:49,796
"Any use of this telecast
or any pictures, descriptions

1075
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,505
or accounts of the game
without the express consent..."

1076
00:54:52,838 --> 00:54:55,796
Exactly. That could have been considered
an NBA event

1077
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,213
if you got NBA players there
and they were recording.

1078
00:54:58,296 --> 00:55:00,671
That's what I mean
about owning their own image.

1079
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:02,880
We're at the height
of the information era.

1080
00:55:03,421 --> 00:55:06,463
- It's true.
- [Sam] I mean, his likeness is everywhere.

1081
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:10,005
And the team gets to decide
whether or not he can post a selfie

1082
00:55:10,088 --> 00:55:12,505
- or whether it's unflattering?
- [Erick] Wait.

1083
00:55:12,588 --> 00:55:13,588
I can go to jail?

1084
00:55:14,005 --> 00:55:16,671
Technically, you're... on neutral ground.

1085
00:55:17,796 --> 00:55:18,796
I'm what?

1086
00:55:21,005 --> 00:55:24,755
Well... Look,
in New Orleans, we say the neutral ground

1087
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:27,338
is the place where black slaves
and white folks...

1088
00:55:28,421 --> 00:55:29,421
[Myra] What?

1089
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:35,755
Neutral ground is the median
where black vendors could sell to...

1090
00:55:35,838 --> 00:55:36,838
[groaning]

1091
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:37,880
Without...

1092
00:55:38,255 --> 00:55:39,838
Why are y'all acting like this?

1093
00:55:39,921 --> 00:55:42,296
You just spoke about slavery
in front of Spence.

1094
00:55:44,338 --> 00:55:45,546
Yeah, and?

1095
00:55:46,046 --> 00:55:48,505
I have a rule on my court.

1096
00:55:50,588 --> 00:55:51,755
This is my office.

1097
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:52,921
I'm here.

1098
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:54,796
My court.

1099
00:55:57,171 --> 00:56:01,213
Anybody who refers to the institution
of slavery in front of me,

1100
00:56:01,838 --> 00:56:04,796
particularly in reference to basketball
or its players,

1101
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:08,171
must say the words

1102
00:56:09,005 --> 00:56:11,838
or they are banished forever.

1103
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:15,796
You've got to be joking.

1104
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:17,838
You should probably just say it.

1105
00:56:18,546 --> 00:56:20,463
- It's mad short too.
- What?

1106
00:56:20,921 --> 00:56:23,713
I mean, you referred to a black person
as a commodity

1107
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,880
or a vendor during slave times...

1108
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:29,630
I'm not gonna parse on it
because the metaphor wasn't really...

1109
00:56:31,005 --> 00:56:32,005
Okay.

1110
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:35,171
It's Sunday, I have a fucking hangover.
What are the goddamn words?

1111
00:56:35,255 --> 00:56:37,755
"I love the Lord

1112
00:56:38,588 --> 00:56:40,213
and all His black people."

1113
00:56:45,921 --> 00:56:48,796
I'd love for you all
to get the fuck out of my office.

1114
00:56:49,755 --> 00:56:50,796
[Darius] <i>Yeah.</i>

1115
00:56:52,671 --> 00:56:54,713
- [Freddy] <i>Yes!</i>
<i>- </i>[Darius] <i>We got this taped!</i>

1116
00:57:07,296 --> 00:57:08,671
That remind you of you?

1117
00:57:08,796 --> 00:57:09,921
[Ray chuckles]

1118
00:57:10,046 --> 00:57:11,546
Hey, I was never this cool.

1119
00:57:12,463 --> 00:57:16,380
Even at my video-game zenith,
my tech savvy paled in comparison.

1120
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,005
[Sam snickers]

1121
00:57:18,755 --> 00:57:21,213
Well, you still know how
to employ those who can.

1122
00:57:21,338 --> 00:57:23,338
You primed him up. He played the game.

1123
00:57:26,463 --> 00:57:27,463
[Ray sighs]

1124
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,296
Yeah, well, he's not really talking to me.

1125
00:57:30,588 --> 00:57:32,468
You bent his heart. You
didn't have to do that.

1126
00:57:34,588 --> 00:57:36,130
- I didn't ask you to.
- I wanted to.

1127
00:57:39,963 --> 00:57:40,963
Well...

1128
00:57:41,338 --> 00:57:44,588
Umber was about to assassinate him.
I've never seen E so shaken.

1129
00:57:45,463 --> 00:57:47,796
I guess that's why
he doesn't sex before games.

1130
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,796
Yeah, well, nobody does right before.

1131
00:57:50,588 --> 00:57:51,796
Except maybe Wilt.

1132
00:57:52,588 --> 00:57:53,630
[Sam giggles]

1133
00:57:58,296 --> 00:58:00,296
What did you start as for your cousin?

1134
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,755
- He was your first client, right?
- Yeah. Publicity.

1135
00:58:07,963 --> 00:58:09,713
- You ran his marketing?
- Mm-hmm.

1136
00:58:10,296 --> 00:58:13,505
First, there wasn't much to handle.
Moved into representation a little later.

1137
00:58:15,088 --> 00:58:17,463
Did you tell him
to hide the fact he was gay?

1138
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:18,630
Yep.

1139
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:24,838
Do you regret that?

1140
00:58:27,255 --> 00:58:28,838
I regret many things, Sam.

1141
00:58:30,255 --> 00:58:32,213
Protecting my cousin's not one of 'em.

1142
00:58:34,171 --> 00:58:35,213
You think, uh...

1143
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:37,880
think he'll be too hurt?

1144
00:58:38,671 --> 00:58:39,796
- Who?
- Erick.

1145
00:58:40,463 --> 00:58:41,463
Oh...

1146
00:58:42,796 --> 00:58:44,296
It's hard to tell.

1147
00:58:44,713 --> 00:58:46,421
He could rise to the occasion.

1148
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:55,130
We good?

1149
00:58:55,755 --> 00:58:56,755
Yup.

1150
00:58:57,171 --> 00:58:59,755
Just remember:
Keep your head straight, tone light.

1151
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:02,838
"It was all just fun.
I wasn't tryin' to start nothin'."

1152
00:59:04,338 --> 00:59:05,380
I got you.

1153
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:13,171
[camera shutters click]

1154
00:59:13,338 --> 00:59:16,505
[Ray] Thank you all for coming
on a weekend at short notice.

1155
00:59:17,213 --> 00:59:18,213
We just, uh...

1156
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:22,171
Well, I wanted my client
to have a chance to...

1157
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:26,796
Listen, his intentions were and are good.

1158
00:59:27,005 --> 00:59:30,880
Both he and Jamero Umber were there
as guests of the Back Court charity event.

1159
00:59:33,755 --> 00:59:34,838
They were set up...

1160
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:44,880
They were set up by me.

1161
00:59:44,963 --> 00:59:46,130
[shocked gasping]

1162
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:50,463
What you all saw
on your smartphones and tablets...

1163
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:52,671
was raw.

1164
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,671
It was palpable and it was real.

1165
00:59:55,463 --> 00:59:56,796
It was the beginning of change,

1166
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,380
change of this game that's been played
behind the game.

1167
00:59:59,463 --> 01:00:00,838
What you saw yesterday...

1168
01:00:01,921 --> 01:00:02,963
was just a glimmer,

1169
01:00:03,588 --> 01:00:07,713
a lightning flash of what could be
the beginning of a whole new industry.

1170
01:00:11,005 --> 01:00:12,005
Any questions?

1171
01:00:12,088 --> 01:00:13,713
[journalists] Ray!

1172
01:00:13,796 --> 01:00:15,880
[man] Is Erick going to the NBA or not?

1173
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:18,005
We'll have to wait and see.

1174
01:00:18,088 --> 01:00:20,046
[Erick] You said,
"Don't worry about the money."

1175
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:22,671
- Change of plans.
- What are you doin', man?

1176
01:00:22,755 --> 01:00:25,213
This is my career! I always dreamed
of playin' in the league.

1177
01:00:25,296 --> 01:00:27,921
Is that what you dreamt of
when you were on the court with Spence?

1178
01:00:28,005 --> 01:00:31,296
'Cause he said he was always having
to dig you out of some girl's room

1179
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:33,588
- or away from some hangout.
- I was a <i>kid, </i>fam!

1180
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:35,921
That's what kids in New York do
during summer camps.

1181
01:00:36,005 --> 01:00:39,171
Girls in the Heights like you more
if they know you gon' be gone in the fall.

1182
01:00:39,255 --> 01:00:41,880
Look, all I'm sayin' is
I was serious about the game then

1183
01:00:41,963 --> 01:00:44,380
- and I'm serious about the game now.
- Hey, E!

1184
01:00:44,463 --> 01:00:46,838
This didn't mess up your chances
with the team.

1185
01:00:46,921 --> 01:00:50,088
Your contract is only pending
because of the lockout.

1186
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:52,463
As soon as the owners
and the PA come to an agreement,

1187
01:00:52,546 --> 01:00:54,963
your check will move from escrow
to your account.

1188
01:00:55,046 --> 01:00:57,505
Not if they think
I'm tryin' to pimp pickup games!

1189
01:00:57,588 --> 01:00:58,713
[sighs] Come on, E!

1190
01:00:59,755 --> 01:01:01,338
Did you just hear me, man?

1191
01:01:02,005 --> 01:01:04,921
Huh? You are not currently
legally bound to them.

1192
01:01:05,005 --> 01:01:06,796
You are in the sweet spot.

1193
01:01:08,213 --> 01:01:11,296
You have a chance, sir, to do
what has never been done before.

1194
01:01:11,713 --> 01:01:14,171
We are disruptors - you, me and Umber.

1195
01:01:14,255 --> 01:01:16,005
So, you just want to rep him, too?

1196
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:18,630
Why do you think so small?

1197
01:01:20,838 --> 01:01:22,963
Man, you didn't feel it

1198
01:01:23,296 --> 01:01:25,796
when you snatched that ball
out of Jamero's hand,

1199
01:01:26,088 --> 01:01:28,963
when he thought he had you crossed up
and you picked his pockets?

1200
01:01:29,046 --> 01:01:31,713
You didn't feel it?
Man, the whole world stopped.

1201
01:01:32,213 --> 01:01:33,588
Those two kids watching

1202
01:01:33,671 --> 01:01:36,463
haven't stopped dancing
and selfieing since.

1203
01:01:36,588 --> 01:01:38,088
- You didn't see it?
- No, man.

1204
01:01:38,171 --> 01:01:41,463
Man, when a million faces
that would normally record the game

1205
01:01:41,546 --> 01:01:42,963
and fast-forward to the good parts,

1206
01:01:43,046 --> 01:01:45,546
when they had to hear about it
at the water cooler,

1207
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:47,963
man, I knew right <i>then</i>
that we had they ass!

1208
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:50,796
We had something
that they can't bottle up.

1209
01:01:53,588 --> 01:01:54,713
What would you pay

1210
01:01:55,755 --> 01:01:58,255
to be at an event so exclusive

1211
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:02,838
that you could only catch glimmers of it
on Snapchat and YouTube?

1212
01:02:02,921 --> 01:02:03,921
YouTube?

1213
01:02:03,963 --> 01:02:06,421
Facebook called and said
they'd pay you and Umber

1214
01:02:06,505 --> 01:02:08,588
for streaming rights to your one-on-one.

1215
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,213
- How much?
- It don't matter. I told 'em no.

1216
01:02:11,296 --> 01:02:12,921
Fuck you do that for?

1217
01:02:14,046 --> 01:02:16,338
'Cause Netflix wants a sit-down tomorrow.

1218
01:02:16,755 --> 01:02:18,588
Only thing they don't have
is live streaming,

1219
01:02:18,671 --> 01:02:20,255
but we could lead their market.

1220
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:25,380
The money would go direct to you two -
no Players Association, no league.

1221
01:02:25,838 --> 01:02:28,088
Just ten percent for you,
then taxes, right?

1222
01:02:28,838 --> 01:02:30,296
It ain't about the money, man.

1223
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:33,180
We talking about money 'cause that
makes them listen and pay attention,

1224
01:02:33,255 --> 01:02:36,088
but this makes you the decider, brother.

1225
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:39,005
The game that they made
over the game is over.

1226
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:41,255
It's your game now if you want it.

1227
01:02:43,005 --> 01:02:45,963
[sighs] Come on, South Side,
we don't need the league, man!

1228
01:02:46,255 --> 01:02:48,255
We don't need the Players Association.

1229
01:02:48,338 --> 01:02:50,755
Let them battle that shit out
over network rights

1230
01:02:50,838 --> 01:02:54,130
and splits for the next few months
while you, me and a few others,

1231
01:02:54,213 --> 01:02:55,338
we wreck shop!

1232
01:02:55,421 --> 01:02:57,088
Paid event by event, like...

1233
01:02:57,338 --> 01:02:58,338
Boxing.

1234
01:02:59,255 --> 01:03:00,796
But without the brain damage.

1235
01:03:01,671 --> 01:03:02,755
Umber, he in?

1236
01:03:03,755 --> 01:03:04,838
What you think?

1237
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:09,505
Now, I brought you to church,
so you know I wasn't speaking no lies.

1238
01:03:09,755 --> 01:03:12,130
I can't beguile you
in the house of the Lord.

1239
01:03:12,213 --> 01:03:14,630
So, you're saying it's the gospel truth?

1240
01:03:15,671 --> 01:03:19,505
Listen, I saw them do it with Jayvier
when he signed with the Jets.

1241
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:24,171
The NFL was talking about how he was young
and this and that.

1242
01:03:24,255 --> 01:03:26,588
Oh, they had all this talk.

1243
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:28,713
But I'm a mother.

1244
01:03:29,296 --> 01:03:30,880
God blessed me with two kids.

1245
01:03:31,005 --> 01:03:35,130
And what's the Bible teach us?
Sow your seed that you may have a legacy.

1246
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:37,963
So, I was hard on 'em.

1247
01:03:38,838 --> 01:03:40,963
I was their mother and their father.

1248
01:03:41,255 --> 01:03:44,171
And you see how well Jay is doing
in the NFL.

1249
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,088
That's what I want for Jamero in the NBA.

1250
01:03:47,755 --> 01:03:50,255
So, he can take his rightful place
on the throne.

1251
01:03:50,463 --> 01:03:54,713
Do you have anything you want to say
to the league, the PA about the lockout?

1252
01:03:55,171 --> 01:03:56,338
Oh, it's been said.

1253
01:03:57,213 --> 01:03:59,088
Uh-huh. That's all they do is talk.

1254
01:03:59,546 --> 01:04:02,921
They need to get out the way with
all the talkin' and let the future in.

1255
01:04:03,630 --> 01:04:06,671
- [Ray] I would say...
- [Spence] You don't know what you doin'?

1256
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:08,630
I do. Love it?

1257
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:14,750
Man, it feels so good. I
know that feeling, you know.

1258
01:04:18,838 --> 01:04:20,088
- [Ray chuckles]
- I know.

1259
01:04:20,213 --> 01:04:21,213
Yeah?

1260
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:23,630
It's like it's funny because...

1261
01:04:24,463 --> 01:04:26,880
You know, it's catchy, but not contagious.

1262
01:04:28,505 --> 01:04:32,213
You know, it's like, you know,
you see what nobody else can see,

1263
01:04:32,296 --> 01:04:34,213
but they all askin' for it,
they all want it.

1264
01:04:34,296 --> 01:04:35,296
Yeah.

1265
01:04:36,546 --> 01:04:39,088
When you all had the league,
what happened?

1266
01:04:41,213 --> 01:04:42,338
Well, man...

1267
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:44,463
No... Well...

1268
01:04:45,588 --> 01:04:48,796
We made decisions
based on what we needed.

1269
01:04:50,338 --> 01:04:53,505
And the players wanted
to play more like they done on the courts,

1270
01:04:53,588 --> 01:04:54,713
so we allowed it, man.

1271
01:04:54,796 --> 01:04:56,963
Man, you... Man, you could jump,

1272
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:00,546
you could slam on a cat
if he got in your way, man.

1273
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:05,213
The whole game grew based on our hunger,
our hunger for it.

1274
01:05:05,338 --> 01:05:07,380
Whoa. But you couldn't pay for it?

1275
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:10,880
Not enough.

1276
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:14,630
Man...

1277
01:05:16,505 --> 01:05:17,505
For a second,

1278
01:05:18,671 --> 01:05:20,671
man, I could see a whole infrastructure

1279
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:24,296
that put the control back in the hands
of those behind the ball,

1280
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:26,255
instead of those up in the sky box.

1281
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:30,380
- Nah, it can't sustain, man.
- It never had to.

1282
01:05:30,463 --> 01:05:32,103
Don't hit me with that Ivy League talk...

1283
01:05:32,171 --> 01:05:35,171
- Spence, man, Rutgers ain't no Ivy League.
- Black Ivy, man.

1284
01:05:35,255 --> 01:05:37,255
Why set it up if it's
not gonna last forever?

1285
01:05:42,796 --> 01:05:44,796
Why make a man if only to watch him die?

1286
01:05:45,421 --> 01:05:46,588
Playin' God now.

1287
01:05:47,963 --> 01:05:48,963
Nah, man.

1288
01:05:50,088 --> 01:05:52,755
I just wanted to snatch the game
out they hands for a minute.

1289
01:05:54,171 --> 01:05:55,255
I don't need it.

1290
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,338
I just wanted to hold it,
just for a second.

1291
01:06:00,671 --> 01:06:02,963
So, they know... like I know.

1292
01:06:05,213 --> 01:06:07,213
How do you show a man his humanity?

1293
01:06:08,421 --> 01:06:10,130
You remind him of his mortality.

1294
01:06:19,796 --> 01:06:21,796
[Adamn Killa "Roof Roof" plays]

1295
01:06:22,546 --> 01:06:23,588
What's up?

1296
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:49,630
Are you okay?

1297
01:06:51,213 --> 01:06:52,463
Tch... I don't know.

1298
01:06:55,171 --> 01:06:56,255
[he sighs]

1299
01:06:58,046 --> 01:06:59,606
[she sighs] [Spence] <i>Erick's not Gavin.</i>

1300
01:07:04,713 --> 01:07:05,713
[Ray] I know.

1301
01:07:05,796 --> 01:07:08,630
- [Spence] He's not Ray, either.
- You think he's listening to me?

1302
01:07:09,671 --> 01:07:11,963
[Spence] You said you talked to him.
He reading his bible?

1303
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:14,713
[Ray] He's no visionary, man,
no revolutionary.

1304
01:07:14,796 --> 01:07:17,880
He's a player, exactly the type of player
who needs to be in the league.

1305
01:07:17,963 --> 01:07:20,046
You hire him to show up, play hard,

1306
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:22,755
get upset about the world
and take it out on the game

1307
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:25,213
- and he is one of the best.
- Yes, he is.

1308
01:07:25,296 --> 01:07:28,671
But he ain't a game-changer.
He's just happy to be playin' the game.

1309
01:07:29,671 --> 01:07:31,005
Well, you never know.

1310
01:07:31,671 --> 01:07:32,796
Are you mad at him?

1311
01:07:33,463 --> 01:07:34,463
Nope.

1312
01:07:34,796 --> 01:07:35,796
Not at all.

1313
01:07:38,338 --> 01:07:41,255
He just barged in
and said you'd want to see him.

1314
01:07:41,671 --> 01:07:44,921
[woman] He parked himself in your office.
I didn't know what to do.

1315
01:07:45,755 --> 01:07:48,088
Just hold whoever called
or whoever comes by

1316
01:07:48,171 --> 01:07:51,588
until I can catch my breath
and catch up with the rest of the world.

1317
01:07:53,171 --> 01:07:54,296
Good morning, Myra!

1318
01:07:55,005 --> 01:07:56,005
[Myra] David.

1319
01:07:56,463 --> 01:07:58,255
Sorry to bother you first thing.

1320
01:07:59,796 --> 01:08:01,505
I thought you were in New Zealand.

1321
01:08:01,755 --> 01:08:04,838
Australia had to wait.
Something urgent's come up.

1322
01:08:05,755 --> 01:08:07,171
- It did?
- Oh, yes.

1323
01:08:07,630 --> 01:08:08,963
I thought you'd be happy.

1324
01:08:10,046 --> 01:08:11,755
I started reading this agreement

1325
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:15,088
and I think I can talk the others
into a resolution.

1326
01:08:15,171 --> 01:08:19,255
These guys, these men are giving us
their top-earning years.

1327
01:08:19,338 --> 01:08:20,796
It's the least we can do.

1328
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:23,421
How generous.

1329
01:08:24,046 --> 01:08:26,588
Well, I'm approaching retirement myself
so...

1330
01:08:27,213 --> 01:08:28,963
No, no... [chuckling]

1331
01:08:29,255 --> 01:08:31,963
How generous do you think
you can talk the others into being?

1332
01:08:33,421 --> 01:08:36,046
Ah. Well, not far from what you're asking.

1333
01:08:54,963 --> 01:08:57,880
Hey there, fella.
You think you could move over a bit?

1334
01:09:20,130 --> 01:09:21,505
[relaxed sigh]

1335
01:09:24,421 --> 01:09:25,755
How are you doing, David?

1336
01:09:27,088 --> 01:09:29,963
I'm all right, Ray. And you?

1337
01:09:30,046 --> 01:09:31,421
Well, I've been stressed.

1338
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:32,921
But you know that.

1339
01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:35,880
I mean, you don't know <i>about </i>it,
but you know.

1340
01:09:35,963 --> 01:09:37,880
Oh, that's not fair. I stress.

1341
01:09:39,130 --> 01:09:40,546
This spot does help.

1342
01:09:41,255 --> 01:09:43,838
I'm trying to enjoy it
while I can still afford it.

1343
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:47,171
If you're trying to tug on pity,
that's not your style.

1344
01:09:47,255 --> 01:09:49,880
You're not some newbie.
I know you're stored for the winter.

1345
01:09:49,963 --> 01:09:53,588
Mayhaps, but the well's a little low
and I've got a farm to feed.

1346
01:09:54,755 --> 01:09:56,421
Well, you grew up in the city.

1347
01:09:57,213 --> 01:09:58,713
Metaphor and that.

1348
01:10:00,255 --> 01:10:02,880
I forget, did Gavin grow up in the city?

1349
01:10:07,838 --> 01:10:09,005
Family's from Duval.

1350
01:10:09,421 --> 01:10:10,796
Duval. Oh...

1351
01:10:11,463 --> 01:10:12,796
Your country cousin, huh?

1352
01:10:13,963 --> 01:10:16,130
His people and your people
still down there?

1353
01:10:16,213 --> 01:10:19,380
My aunt still lives there, yeah,
but, again, you know that.

1354
01:10:19,713 --> 01:10:21,755
Indeed... [sighs]

1355
01:10:22,255 --> 01:10:24,921
Still gotta spend a little something
to keep her coming to court?

1356
01:10:25,005 --> 01:10:26,005
You know what?

1357
01:10:27,505 --> 01:10:30,880
- I'll let you have it.
- No, I got meetings to attend.

1358
01:10:30,963 --> 01:10:32,963
I just came in to clear my sinuses.

1359
01:10:33,255 --> 01:10:35,213
[blows nose]

1360
01:10:36,005 --> 01:10:37,171
Ah...

1361
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:40,588
Guessing that's all the comfort relief
I'll get today.

1362
01:10:48,296 --> 01:10:49,630
Gonna go see Myra?

1363
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:52,630
Nope, I already saw her.
That's done for today.

1364
01:10:54,005 --> 01:10:58,005
I'm gonna see if our friends over at ABC
and NBC want to talk now or later.

1365
01:10:58,630 --> 01:10:59,630
Nice.

1366
01:11:00,296 --> 01:11:04,171
It's a long weekend so, they'll probably
be more interested in "later."

1367
01:11:04,338 --> 01:11:05,588
Yeah, that's fine.

1368
01:11:08,838 --> 01:11:11,296
Why don't you just give the boys club
what they're asking for?

1369
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:14,005
"Boys." Ah...

1370
01:11:14,255 --> 01:11:16,463
You know better
than to call them that, Ray.

1371
01:11:16,713 --> 01:11:17,796
They are <i>men.</i>

1372
01:11:18,338 --> 01:11:20,380
Knew what they were getting into
when they signed.

1373
01:11:20,463 --> 01:11:23,630
And now they want to be sure what
they're getting after the signatures fade.

1374
01:11:23,796 --> 01:11:25,588
Isn't that what they have you for?

1375
01:11:27,588 --> 01:11:32,338
Look, their payout is more, yes,
but they have agents, managers, lawyers

1376
01:11:32,796 --> 01:11:35,046
and most are still being taxed
as individuals. They...

1377
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:36,963
They are fine. It's fair.

1378
01:11:37,338 --> 01:11:38,796
They get half, we get half.

1379
01:11:39,130 --> 01:11:42,171
Hell, we still gotta pay the organization.
Why should they get more?

1380
01:11:42,255 --> 01:11:44,463
Well, there's more of them... every year.

1381
01:11:45,755 --> 01:11:46,963
More mouths to feed.

1382
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:52,838
You ever been in a relationship?
I mean, a real, beautiful relationship?

1383
01:11:53,505 --> 01:11:56,421
Sometimes, you gotta let it stall

1384
01:11:56,505 --> 01:11:59,838
- before you recognize what you got.
- Before it's gone.

1385
01:11:59,921 --> 01:12:00,921
Mmhmm.

1386
01:12:02,713 --> 01:12:03,713
Well, David...

1387
01:12:04,296 --> 01:12:07,505
where I'm from, Mr. Steal Your Girl
is more than just a song.

1388
01:12:08,546 --> 01:12:11,005
He's younger, he's faster...

1389
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:15,255
and he doesn't have to show up
in courtside seats to make an impression.

1390
01:12:16,755 --> 01:12:19,671
You're not thinking of breaking up
our happy marriage, are you?

1391
01:12:19,796 --> 01:12:20,796
No.

1392
01:12:36,046 --> 01:12:37,046
[man] Excuse me.

1393
01:12:38,838 --> 01:12:40,588
Why am I not surprised?

1394
01:12:40,838 --> 01:12:42,713
Sorry to ambush you, Doug.

1395
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:46,505
This agent, Ray Burke,

1396
01:12:47,671 --> 01:12:48,921
you know what he's doing?

1397
01:12:49,255 --> 01:12:50,463
Well, you've met him.

1398
01:12:50,963 --> 01:12:52,630
- He's smart.
- How smart?

1399
01:12:52,963 --> 01:12:55,213
You saw the charity video.

1400
01:12:55,296 --> 01:12:59,463
- Me and 24 million other people.
- Yeah, I don't think that's a real number.

1401
01:12:59,546 --> 01:13:01,088
I had Connie check it.

1402
01:13:02,755 --> 01:13:04,921
While I was watching, I got a pop-up ad

1403
01:13:05,005 --> 01:13:07,838
for a "Lockout street ball" event
in Vegas tonight,

1404
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:10,880
which I found intriguing
for a variety of reasons.

1405
01:13:10,963 --> 01:13:11,963
Well, we've um...

1406
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:13,463
We canceled that.

1407
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:14,630
The game?

1408
01:13:14,713 --> 01:13:15,755
The ad.

1409
01:13:16,088 --> 01:13:20,255
We argued that the word "lockout"
is tacitly implying an NBA relationship.

1410
01:13:20,338 --> 01:13:23,046
- I'm pretty sure it's pulled.
- Well, why wouldn't they?

1411
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:25,338
They'd already sold out
the fucking building.

1412
01:13:25,421 --> 01:13:28,671
StubHub's got a courtside single
for 1,400.

1413
01:13:30,588 --> 01:13:31,713
[Doug sighs]

1414
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:35,046
Tell me we don't have players
in Vegas tonight.

1415
01:13:35,171 --> 01:13:36,755
Well, we're waiting on a list.

1416
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:40,421
And, no, I don't think
Ray Burke put this together.

1417
01:13:41,630 --> 01:13:43,630
That would be the bad news, David.

1418
01:13:44,046 --> 01:13:46,713
That would mean this thing's out there
breathing on its own.

1419
01:13:48,755 --> 01:13:51,588
Full disclosure,
there is a game in Miami tomorrow.

1420
01:13:52,213 --> 01:13:55,653
You mean the "Bring Your Ring Three-On-Three"?
[sighs] You know what I hate about this?

1421
01:14:03,088 --> 01:14:04,796
It's exactly what I'd do.

1422
01:14:06,005 --> 01:14:07,380
I think you can do better.

1423
01:14:08,421 --> 01:14:09,421
Well, why?

1424
01:14:09,505 --> 01:14:11,588
Because I know
some very valuable player's

1425
01:14:11,671 --> 01:14:13,713
having a conversation
with the competitors.

1426
01:14:13,796 --> 01:14:17,088
Oh, you mean the meeting
that Ray Burke is supposed to be having

1427
01:14:17,213 --> 01:14:19,880
with Hulu or somebody?
Yeah. No, that didn't happen.

1428
01:14:20,088 --> 01:14:22,838
We renegotiated with our networks
this morning.

1429
01:14:25,255 --> 01:14:26,588
Like I told you, My...

1430
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:31,088
I had a real "come to Jesus" moment
about this whole thing.

1431
01:14:31,588 --> 01:14:35,088
I walked down there
and we figured out the contract,

1432
01:14:35,421 --> 01:14:37,255
numbers to be decided in good faith,

1433
01:14:37,338 --> 01:14:40,755
and I told them I was coming to see you
to put things to rights.

1434
01:14:40,838 --> 01:14:43,421
- Told who?
- The team. NY.

1435
01:14:43,505 --> 01:14:47,425
You know you're not supposed to talk to them
without... No, I didn't talk. I mean, I sent an email.

1436
01:14:47,921 --> 01:14:50,963
I mean, I may be old school,
but I know how to hit "send."

1437
01:14:51,255 --> 01:14:53,505
Yeah, I sent an email
at 9 a.m. this morning

1438
01:14:53,588 --> 01:14:57,505
stating that I would do everything
in my power to undo this lockout today.

1439
01:14:58,088 --> 01:15:00,463
Check your messages.
I CC'd you as players' rep.

1440
01:15:03,338 --> 01:15:05,921
Like I told you, I believe in family.

1441
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:10,171
This team's my family.

1442
01:15:10,921 --> 01:15:13,380
I need us to be one big family again.

1443
01:15:20,505 --> 01:15:21,546
[she sighs]

1444
01:15:23,255 --> 01:15:24,505
Have a seat.

1445
01:15:29,755 --> 01:15:32,921
[Towns] I think the biggest thing
you have to also remember is you got

1446
01:15:33,005 --> 01:15:37,671
to make sure you reevaluate your circle,
you know? You gotta reevaluate...

1447
01:15:37,755 --> 01:15:40,713
"All right, does this person
need to be here for the ride?

1448
01:15:40,796 --> 01:15:45,397
"Or have they been riding my coattails? Have they been real
to me?" You know, it's always good to sit back sometimes

1449
01:15:46,713 --> 01:15:49,505
and reevaluate, "Are the people around you
there for you"

1450
01:15:49,588 --> 01:15:52,005
or are they there for you
after June 25th?"

1451
01:15:52,088 --> 01:15:53,505
That was my draft day.

1452
01:15:53,838 --> 01:15:58,505
So, if they're there for you
no matter what happens,

1453
01:15:58,630 --> 01:16:00,546
there's good friends,
but you must understand

1454
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:02,921
sometimes even the people
who are there for you

1455
01:16:03,005 --> 01:16:04,880
may not be the people
you need to have around.

1456
01:16:04,963 --> 01:16:08,088
They may not be the best people to have
around you for your image

1457
01:16:08,171 --> 01:16:12,005
or for the journey
you're gonna be a part of.

1458
01:16:12,088 --> 01:16:14,088
[muzak playing]

1459
01:16:22,421 --> 01:16:23,463
Morning, Sam.

1460
01:16:25,005 --> 01:16:26,005
Need to talk?

1461
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,046
I wanted to prime you.

1462
01:16:28,588 --> 01:16:31,588
I told you,
I like my news straight from the source.

1463
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:34,046
Well, um...

1464
01:16:35,046 --> 01:16:36,546
Erick's gonna fire you.

1465
01:16:37,963 --> 01:16:38,963
Why?

1466
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,088
It's a conclusion he came to
after we talked.

1467
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:48,046
Or he thinks he's gonna fire you.

1468
01:16:48,130 --> 01:16:50,338
He's really just moving laterally
in the company.

1469
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:52,171
It's his decision?

1470
01:16:52,963 --> 01:16:54,463
- All him.
- No coaching?

1471
01:16:55,088 --> 01:16:56,838
He's been coached his whole life.

1472
01:16:57,838 --> 01:17:01,296
It's actually good to see him choose
how he's gonna be represented.

1473
01:17:01,963 --> 01:17:03,255
- Hmm.
- Mm.

1474
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,005
What, um...

1475
01:17:08,255 --> 01:17:09,296
What about you?

1476
01:17:10,088 --> 01:17:11,171
What about me?

1477
01:17:12,505 --> 01:17:13,755
You firing me too?

1478
01:17:16,421 --> 01:17:18,838
I don't work for you anymore!
[laughs]

1479
01:17:20,463 --> 01:17:23,088
Are you... "moving laterally"?

1480
01:17:23,963 --> 01:17:25,171
No, I'm just...

1481
01:17:26,421 --> 01:17:27,880
moving towards the goal.

1482
01:17:28,921 --> 01:17:30,296
Feel like it's a good move?

1483
01:17:31,421 --> 01:17:33,755
- All moves towards a goal are good.
- [chuckles]

1484
01:17:33,838 --> 01:17:34,838
Starr know that?

1485
01:17:35,213 --> 01:17:36,921
Starr don't know shit from Shine.

1486
01:17:37,171 --> 01:17:38,838
- Well played.
- Mmhmm.

1487
01:17:41,838 --> 01:17:43,421
And when's Myra stepping down?

1488
01:17:45,588 --> 01:17:48,046
In, like, a year, after the baby's born.

1489
01:17:48,171 --> 01:17:51,130
Good. Gives you enough time
to learn the lay of the land.

1490
01:17:52,171 --> 01:17:55,463
Yeah, gives me enough time to learn it
and enough time to run it.

1491
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:58,463
I don't like working for anyone.

1492
01:17:58,630 --> 01:18:01,838
- You'll be working for every player...
- Yeah, for now.

1493
01:18:06,921 --> 01:18:08,963
Well, you need help moving out of SAV?

1494
01:18:11,838 --> 01:18:13,588
Are you gonna take pity on Erick?

1495
01:18:16,963 --> 01:18:18,005
Think I should?

1496
01:18:19,171 --> 01:18:20,171
No.

1497
01:18:22,046 --> 01:18:24,171
I like him better
when he stands up for himself.

1498
01:18:25,046 --> 01:18:26,338
He's good on defense.

1499
01:18:28,046 --> 01:18:29,130
[she chuckles]

1500
01:18:29,796 --> 01:18:30,838
Pray for me?

1501
01:18:38,171 --> 01:18:40,296
Go forth and...

1502
01:18:41,296 --> 01:18:42,546
sin no more.

1503
01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:44,630
Amen.

1504
01:18:45,505 --> 01:18:46,505
<i>Ashe.</i>

1505
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:20,546
You lied to me.

1506
01:19:21,463 --> 01:19:23,171
You said this was about the money.

1507
01:19:25,255 --> 01:19:27,671
Yo, Sam told me you ain't even talked
to the people today.

1508
01:19:27,755 --> 01:19:30,755
She said they called this morning and
confirmed you canceled. What happened?

1509
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:34,296
Oh, you all outta stuff to say?

1510
01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:37,338
You used to talk shit about how
we gon' change the game and whatnot.

1511
01:19:37,421 --> 01:19:38,588
What happened, bro?

1512
01:19:40,421 --> 01:19:41,630
I'ma tell you what happened.

1513
01:19:41,713 --> 01:19:44,755
You realized there weren't a big enough
chunk for you without the league in it.

1514
01:19:44,838 --> 01:19:47,630
Without the league, there wasn't enough
for you to suck off of.

1515
01:19:49,505 --> 01:19:51,046
You weren't looking out for me.

1516
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:54,421
Talking about all this money <i>we </i>gon' make,
but the whole time, you knew.

1517
01:19:54,505 --> 01:19:56,505
You knew the league
would've blackballed me.

1518
01:19:56,755 --> 01:19:59,046
You almost ruined that, Ray,
and you don't care?

1519
01:19:59,796 --> 01:20:01,713
Ain't "first do no harm" in the contract?

1520
01:20:01,838 --> 01:20:03,796
That's the Hippocratic oath.
I'm not a doctor.

1521
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,171
Yeah, you fired, though.

1522
01:20:09,338 --> 01:20:10,880
I said you fired, man!

1523
01:20:12,213 --> 01:20:13,213
I heard you.

1524
01:20:13,921 --> 01:20:17,630
So, what you gon' do? Sam told me
you ain't even in talks with the Umbers.

1525
01:20:17,713 --> 01:20:20,755
Said Jamero wasn't ever down
with the one-on-one game style.

1526
01:20:22,671 --> 01:20:23,713
What you gon' do?

1527
01:20:24,005 --> 01:20:25,171
What I was born to do.

1528
01:20:25,505 --> 01:20:26,546
What I came to do.

1529
01:20:28,838 --> 01:20:29,880
Good luck, Erick.

1530
01:20:31,921 --> 01:20:32,921
- [sniffs]
- Good luck.

1531
01:20:36,755 --> 01:20:37,755
Ray?

1532
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:44,921
Don't let 'em fool you
all your life, fella.

1533
01:20:46,588 --> 01:20:48,505
You were born for way more than this.

1534
01:20:50,130 --> 01:20:51,421
Don't let 'em fool you.

1535
01:21:02,046 --> 01:21:02,880
<i>I tell you this.</i>

1536
01:21:03,005 --> 01:21:07,046
<i>Thank God everyone at the event
was thinking about the team.</i>

1537
01:21:08,255 --> 01:21:11,630
<i>So, you were loyal to New York,
even in the lockout?</i>

1538
01:21:13,338 --> 01:21:16,130
[Emera] <i>Oh, I think this lockout is</i>
<i>on its last leg.</i>

1539
01:21:17,046 --> 01:21:18,046
<i>I really do.</i>

1540
01:21:18,130 --> 01:21:21,921
For me, the beginnin' of the year
was my mental was all over the place,

1541
01:21:22,046 --> 01:21:25,213
worryin' about the Rookie of the Year
award and all this outer stuff

1542
01:21:25,296 --> 01:21:26,296
and I struggled.

1543
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:28,880
You know, I've never worried about,
you know, these awards,

1544
01:21:28,963 --> 01:21:30,421
that's never been my mentality.

1545
01:21:30,505 --> 01:21:33,380
I come in here and I'm like,
"Who's gonna win it?

1546
01:21:33,463 --> 01:21:36,046
Who's doing this? Who's doing what?"
And, you know, I think I scored

1547
01:21:36,130 --> 01:21:38,588
a combined 22 points in ten games,
you know, like,

1548
01:21:38,963 --> 01:21:42,588
and, like, 20 turnovers
so I wasn't really contributing much.

1549
01:21:42,921 --> 01:21:46,046
So, I think I took a step back, you know.

1550
01:21:46,130 --> 01:21:48,755
I had the screensaver of
the Rookie of the Year votes on my phone,

1551
01:21:48,838 --> 01:21:50,088
that was my screensaver.

1552
01:21:50,296 --> 01:21:55,338
Switched that, took it all off and, like,
just went back to who I was.

1553
01:21:55,421 --> 01:21:58,755
You know, Steph Curry out there
playing completely free.

1554
01:21:59,088 --> 01:22:02,213
He looks like he's living
in his own world. You see Russ...

1555
01:22:02,421 --> 01:22:05,505
At the same time,
Russell Westbrook, those guys...

1556
01:22:06,213 --> 01:22:07,213
LeBron.

1557
01:22:07,296 --> 01:22:10,296
You can go down the line of guys who
look like they're playing the most free

1558
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:13,005
and the guys actually enjoying
just playing basketball

1559
01:22:13,088 --> 01:22:14,838
are the guys having the most success.

1560
01:22:14,921 --> 01:22:15,963
You've got to find fun.

1561
01:22:16,046 --> 01:22:19,171
I think when you lose fun for the game
and the passion,

1562
01:22:19,255 --> 01:22:22,588
that's when everything goes downhill
or you just... quit.

1563
01:22:22,713 --> 01:22:25,838
You know, I think the biggest thing
about the game of basketball

1564
01:22:25,921 --> 01:22:27,921
that I love so much
and no matter what happens...

1565
01:22:28,005 --> 01:22:31,213
It's not even basketball, just anything
in life. I love the competition.

1566
01:22:31,338 --> 01:22:33,505
The better the competition,
the more fun it becomes.

1567
01:22:33,588 --> 01:22:37,963
I'm just trying to make
an awkward situation not sound so bad.

1568
01:22:38,296 --> 01:22:39,421
How bad is it?

1569
01:22:40,296 --> 01:22:42,588
- Ray, your assistant had...
- Former assistant.

1570
01:22:43,838 --> 01:22:46,880
<i>Former </i>assistant had to save
this company's relationship

1571
01:22:46,963 --> 01:22:49,421
with one of the best players
to enter the league.

1572
01:22:50,046 --> 01:22:52,880
Sam told me she advised Erick
to find someone else at SAV.

1573
01:22:52,963 --> 01:22:55,171
Well, as an assistant
at the Players Association,

1574
01:22:55,255 --> 01:22:56,880
I'd say that's good counsel.

1575
01:22:57,671 --> 01:22:58,671
What?

1576
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:01,296
You didn't know that's where she's going?

1577
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:05,088
So, we lost an assistant agent
all because you were being reckless?

1578
01:23:05,505 --> 01:23:06,755
Mm... One vantage.

1579
01:23:07,171 --> 01:23:10,088
The way I hear it,
Erick almost lost his contract with NY,

1580
01:23:10,171 --> 01:23:13,838
therefore <i>you </i>almost lost him
for us as a client.

1581
01:23:13,921 --> 01:23:15,796
- Never.
- And then you're meeting with Netflix

1582
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:19,671
without anyone from Legal weighing in,
without even running it by another agent.

1583
01:23:19,755 --> 01:23:22,838
We never met. I just set up a meeting.
Those are okay, yes?

1584
01:23:22,921 --> 01:23:25,588
- For what?
- So that people would know about it.

1585
01:23:26,463 --> 01:23:27,588
You're being snide.

1586
01:23:28,296 --> 01:23:30,546
- If I were in your position, I'd...
- You're not.

1587
01:23:30,630 --> 01:23:32,796
You might not be, either,
if upstairs got wind of this.

1588
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,713
- What were you thinking?
- You told me to do something.

1589
01:23:35,963 --> 01:23:37,505
Not fuck up our cash cow!

1590
01:23:37,588 --> 01:23:39,171
Erick Scott is still here

1591
01:23:39,296 --> 01:23:41,630
and once the lockout finally ends,
he can play.

1592
01:23:43,005 --> 01:23:45,921
Ah. Well, thank God, at least that's over.

1593
01:23:46,046 --> 01:23:47,046
Hmm?

1594
01:23:48,421 --> 01:23:49,963
What, you didn't hear?

1595
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:53,463
- The lockout's basically done.
- Hmm.

1596
01:23:53,963 --> 01:23:56,005
Myra and the owners sat down this morning.

1597
01:23:56,713 --> 01:23:57,838
I think that's a record.

1598
01:23:58,546 --> 01:24:01,380
Only took me... 72 hours.

1599
01:24:06,296 --> 01:24:07,505
You see it, right?

1600
01:24:11,921 --> 01:24:13,463
All that... You did all that?

1601
01:24:15,088 --> 01:24:18,130
All the players that were signed before
are still signed now.

1602
01:24:19,213 --> 01:24:22,713
And the well in the mirage,
as you put it, is back on.

1603
01:24:24,421 --> 01:24:26,171
Well, that's...

1604
01:24:26,255 --> 01:24:28,088
Erick Scott was never in any danger.

1605
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:31,796
And Sam... she's in a better place.

1606
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:33,630
She was not long for this world.

1607
01:24:39,963 --> 01:24:44,463
But 72 hours to somehow
get both sides to sit down

1608
01:24:44,588 --> 01:24:47,005
- and agree to put the game back on...
- Yeah.

1609
01:24:47,088 --> 01:24:48,588
Well, yeah. It's... [chuckles]

1610
01:24:48,713 --> 01:24:51,296
I mean, you did it, Ray.

1611
01:24:51,671 --> 01:24:52,671
Yeah, I did.

1612
01:24:52,963 --> 01:24:54,880
You want to go upstairs and tell 'em?

1613
01:24:56,338 --> 01:24:57,380
You want me to?

1614
01:24:59,255 --> 01:25:00,796
What you think they might say?

1615
01:25:02,963 --> 01:25:04,630
Anything happened outside of the lines,

1616
01:25:04,713 --> 01:25:07,213
I was just following orders,
just doing my job.

1617
01:25:11,546 --> 01:25:12,755
No, you've done well.

1618
01:25:13,588 --> 01:25:15,755
You kept your head down
and your nose clean.

1619
01:25:17,046 --> 01:25:18,421
But now you gotta get up.

1620
01:25:19,755 --> 01:25:21,255
You're sitting in my seat.

1621
01:25:25,838 --> 01:25:26,838
[wry chuckle]

1622
01:25:27,421 --> 01:25:28,421
[man] Ray?

1623
01:25:28,796 --> 01:25:29,956
Your 10:30's here. Excuse me.

1624
01:25:52,296 --> 01:25:53,296
Dr. Edwards.

1625
01:25:55,713 --> 01:25:58,088
- Thank you for having me.
- Thank you for coming, sir.

1626
01:25:58,171 --> 01:25:59,588
- Thank you.
- Have a seat.
