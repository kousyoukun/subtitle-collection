1
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,608
Exterminator.

2
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,724
Mm-hmm.

3
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:19,123
You want I should spit right in your face?

4
00:03:19,222 --> 00:03:21,611
You want, hmm?
You want? You want?

5
00:03:21,718 --> 00:03:23,540
I ran out.

6
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:26,420
You ran out?
Oh, that's nice.

7
00:03:26,517 --> 00:03:29,299
You ran out.
It's impossible you run out.!

8
00:03:29,398 --> 00:03:31,340
What'd you do, eat the stuff?.

9
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:33,267
The Chink shortchanged me.

10
00:03:33,365 --> 00:03:35,536
No "glot." Come "Fliday."

11
00:03:40,405 --> 00:03:44,201
It's funny.
It's actual very funny what you just said.

12
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,164
Ran out.

13
00:03:46,261 --> 00:03:50,571
They can either paint it, or draw it, or write
it down and then pass it on to somebody.

14
00:03:50,645 --> 00:03:53,361
They read what you're saying,
and then they reexperience.

15
00:03:53,461 --> 00:03:55,436
That's the only connection
you have with that, man.

16
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,580
So you can't rewrite...

17
00:03:57,686 --> 00:04:00,303
'cause to rewrite is to deceive and lie...

18
00:04:00,405 --> 00:04:02,227
and you betray your own thoughts.

19
00:04:02,324 --> 00:04:06,416
To rethink the flow and the rhythm
and the tumbling out of the words...

20
00:04:06,677 --> 00:04:08,335
is a betrayal.

21
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:10,898
And it's a sin, Martin.
It's a sin.

22
00:04:10,998 --> 00:04:12,884
I don't accept your, uh...

23
00:04:12,981 --> 00:04:15,631
Catholic interpretation
of my compulsive, uh...

24
00:04:16,693 --> 00:04:20,621
necessity to rewrite
every single word at least 1 00 times.

25
00:04:20,724 --> 00:04:24,041
Guilt is -Thanks.
Guilt is the key, not sin.

26
00:04:24,148 --> 00:04:27,017
Guilt re not writing
the best that I can.

27
00:04:27,124 --> 00:04:30,985
Guilt re not, uh, considering everything
from every possible angle.

28
00:04:31,092 --> 00:04:32,946
Balancing everything.

29
00:04:33,044 --> 00:04:37,931
Well, how about guilt
re censoring your best thoughts?

30
00:04:38,035 --> 00:04:40,784
Your most honest,
primitive, real thoughts...

31
00:04:40,884 --> 00:04:44,200
because that's what your laborious
rewriting amounts to, Martin.

32
00:04:45,203 --> 00:04:47,178
Is rewriting really censorship, Bill?

33
00:04:47,283 --> 00:04:50,184
Because I'm completely fucked if it is.

34
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:53,324
Exterminate all rational thought.

35
00:04:53,428 --> 00:04:55,532
That is the conclusion I have come to.

36
00:04:55,635 --> 00:04:58,602
What is the man talking about?
I'm being serious.

37
00:04:58,706 --> 00:05:00,561
So is he.

38
00:05:03,731 --> 00:05:06,414
So how is the extermination business
going there, Bill?

39
00:05:06,482 --> 00:05:10,257
Somebody's stealing my roach powder.
Somebody's got it in for me.

40
00:05:10,355 --> 00:05:13,104
Hmm. Well, Bill,
maybe you should take it as a sign.

41
00:05:13,202 --> 00:05:15,438
Maybe you ought to try your hand
at writing pornography.

42
00:05:15,698 --> 00:05:18,895
Yeah, a novel a week at 120 bucks.
It's serious money.

43
00:05:18,994 --> 00:05:20,849
I can connect you with the guy.

44
00:05:20,914 --> 00:05:23,761
We're thinking of
collaborating on one ourselves.

45
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,832
I gave up writing when I was 1 0.

46
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:30,353
- Too dangerous.
- Only if someone reads what you write.

47
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:32,719
So far we haven't had that problem.

48
00:05:32,977 --> 00:05:34,886
I've found my profession.
I'm an exterminator.

49
00:05:34,994 --> 00:05:38,342
Of course, Bill. That's just what the world needs-
more literate exterminators.

50
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:40,272
Give me a cigarette.

51
00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:46,826
Of course, then, you know...

52
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,929
you're gonna have trouble
if you can't keep track of your roach powder.

53
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,779
Wait a minute.
Do you boys know something about this?

54
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,767
We don't exactly know anything.

55
00:06:02,864 --> 00:06:05,733
No, but we suspect
it's a domestic problem.

56
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:11,916
-
-

57
00:06:38,927 --> 00:06:42,223
- My God, what are you doing?
- You weren't supposed to see this.

58
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,799
Well, now that I'm seeing it, what is it?

59
00:06:46,927 --> 00:06:48,781
I'm shooting up your bug powder.

60
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:52,196
You might like to try it yourself.

61
00:06:52,303 --> 00:06:54,125
Or you might not.

62
00:06:54,223 --> 00:06:57,572
I ran out in the middle of a job.

63
00:07:00,494 --> 00:07:02,568
You gotta stop using the stuff,Joan.

64
00:07:02,671 --> 00:07:05,092
They ration it out like snakebite serum.

65
00:07:05,198 --> 00:07:07,173
Well,just do what everybody else does -

66
00:07:07,278 --> 00:07:09,546
cut it with baby laxative.

67
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:11,845
The roaches will
shit themselves to death.

68
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:15,270
It's the best job I ever had.

69
00:07:15,373 --> 00:07:17,513
If I run out again, I'm finished.

70
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:21,571
Hmm.

71
00:07:23,213 --> 00:07:24,871
It's, um -

72
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,092
It's a very literary high.

73
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:32,077
Very literary.

74
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:34,213
Is that why Hank and Martin
know all about it?

75
00:07:34,316 --> 00:07:36,651
No, we just, uh -

76
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:39,531
We all just tried it together-
spur of the moment thing.

77
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:41,636
They didn't like it, I did.

78
00:07:43,724 --> 00:07:45,830
What do you mean,
it's a literary high?

79
00:07:47,437 --> 00:07:49,292
It's a Kafka high.

80
00:07:49,357 --> 00:07:51,364
You feel like a bug.

81
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,563
Try some.

82
00:07:58,924 --> 00:08:00,811
Well, I don't know.

83
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,889
I don't know.

84
00:08:09,547 --> 00:08:13,257
- I think our metabolisms are very different.
- Whose?

85
00:08:13,323 --> 00:08:15,211
Yours and Kafka's?

86
00:08:16,523 --> 00:08:19,305
I thought you were finished
with doing weird stuff.

87
00:08:20,843 --> 00:08:24,226
I thought I was, too,
but I guess I'm not.

88
00:08:29,515 --> 00:08:31,882
Personally...

89
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:35,109
I prefer a pyrethrum job to a fluoride.

90
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:37,032
With the pyrethrum...

91
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,716
you kill the roaches right there
in front of God and the client...

92
00:08:39,946 --> 00:08:41,986
whereas this starch and fluoride-

93
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,262
leave it around,
the roaches eat it...

94
00:08:44,362 --> 00:08:47,264
come back a few days later,
they're running around fat as hogs.

95
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:52,489
And there it is, Bill.
You want to put on some weight...

96
00:08:52,586 --> 00:08:56,230
you gotta switch
from that yellow powder diet of yours...

97
00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:58,850
to some of this good
fluoride stuff right here.

98
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:02,435
Sure works for the Chink.
He's healthy enough.

99
00:09:02,537 --> 00:09:04,425
You see him scarfthat poison down?

100
00:09:04,521 --> 00:09:07,969
He doesn't really eat it.

101
00:09:08,073 --> 00:09:09,928
It's sleight of hand.

102
00:09:09,993 --> 00:09:13,856
The hell he doesn't. Been breathing in
the powder so long, it just makes him laugh.

103
00:09:13,962 --> 00:09:17,639
Just like them roaches.

104
00:09:29,098 --> 00:09:30,953
William Lee.

105
00:09:34,729 --> 00:09:37,576
- What is this?
- He's Hauser. I'm O'Brien.

106
00:09:37,673 --> 00:09:39,975
City Narcotics.
We're gonna take you downtown, Bill.

107
00:09:40,073 --> 00:09:43,454
Little matter of possession
of a dangerous substance.

108
00:09:50,344 --> 00:09:52,581
You've got quite a record, Bill.

109
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,459
A lot of drugs poured down the old vein.

110
00:09:56,712 --> 00:09:58,884
I was a troubled person then.
I'm married now.

111
00:09:58,984 --> 00:10:00,806
Straight. Got a good job.

112
00:10:00,904 --> 00:10:03,489
That's good, Bill.
That's nice.

113
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,383
- What's this, then?
- That's my job.

114
00:10:08,456 --> 00:10:10,311
I use it to kill bugs.

115
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:13,245
- He says it kills bugs.
- He could be right.

116
00:10:13,352 --> 00:10:15,588
- I'd like to see it.
- Me, too.

117
00:10:15,847 --> 00:10:18,716
- I'd like to see it, too.
- Well, gee.

118
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:24,101
I'd like to demonstrate, but I already
got rid of that last case of crabs I had.

119
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,551
Very funny, Bill.

120
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:31,452
But, you know...

121
00:10:31,558 --> 00:10:33,598
I think we got a bug
around here somewhere.

122
00:10:33,702 --> 00:10:36,158
You're right.

123
00:10:36,262 --> 00:10:39,459
Let's see if that yellow stuff will kill it.

124
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:34,490
We'll be back later
to see how it worked out, kiddo.

125
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,563
Yeah.

126
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,547
Break a leg.

127
00:11:44,516 --> 00:11:47,614
William Lee?

128
00:11:47,716 --> 00:11:51,742
I have arranged all this
just to have a moment alone with you.

129
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,113
I am your case officer.

130
00:11:55,396 --> 00:11:58,179
- Uh, my what?
- Case officer.

131
00:11:58,276 --> 00:12:00,414
You are my agent.

132
00:12:00,516 --> 00:12:03,614
I, in turn, report to your controller.

133
00:12:03,716 --> 00:12:08,287
Come, come, Mr. Lee.
You don't have to play dumb with me.

134
00:12:08,388 --> 00:12:11,203
Oh. No. Well...

135
00:12:12,227 --> 00:12:14,115
that would be foolish, wouldn't it?

136
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:16,700
It would. Say, Bill...

137
00:12:17,762 --> 00:12:21,919
do you think you could rub
some of this powder on my lips?

138
00:12:23,907 --> 00:12:25,762
Uh, yeah.

139
00:12:25,859 --> 00:12:27,714
Sure.

140
00:12:37,827 --> 00:12:39,484
Well, now.

141
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,752
As you might have expected...

142
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,422
I have instructions
for you from Control.

143
00:12:49,826 --> 00:12:52,640
It's about the little woman.

144
00:12:54,626 --> 00:12:57,528
- The what?
- The little woman.

145
00:12:57,633 --> 00:12:59,521
Your little woman.

146
00:12:59,585 --> 00:13:03,163
- Your wife.
- Tell me.

147
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:07,190
Your wife is not really your wife.

148
00:13:07,298 --> 00:13:11,072
She is an agent of Interzone Incorporated.

149
00:13:11,168 --> 00:13:13,056
You must kill her.

150
00:13:13,313 --> 00:13:14,938
KillJoan Lee.

151
00:13:15,201 --> 00:13:18,495
It must be done soon-
this week.

152
00:13:18,592 --> 00:13:22,269
And it must be done real tasty.

153
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:24,376
Interzone Incorporated?

154
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,001
An organization based in Interzone...

155
00:13:27,104 --> 00:13:31,261
a notorious free port
on the North African coast.

156
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,716
A haven for
the mongrel scum of the Earth...

157
00:13:34,816 --> 00:13:38,711
an engorged parasite
on the underbelly of the West.

158
00:13:38,816 --> 00:13:41,368
Ah, I can't see it.

159
00:13:41,471 --> 00:13:43,675
Why would a classy
American woman likeJoan...

160
00:13:43,743 --> 00:13:48,118
ever want to work for a two-bit outfit
like Interzone Incorporated?

161
00:13:48,224 --> 00:13:50,907
But who says Joan Lee is really a woman?

162
00:13:51,008 --> 00:13:55,001
In fact, who says she's human at all?

163
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,250
- What do you mean by that?
- I can say no more.

164
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,094
Hey, where you going?

165
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:09,306
Don't do it. Don't do it.
There'll be hell to pay.

166
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:12,627
We've been made.
We gotta get out of town.

167
00:15:12,732 --> 00:15:14,642
Wait a minute.

168
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:19,345
- What's going on?
- I got busted for bug powder.

169
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:22,420
I started hallucinating behind the stuff.

170
00:15:23,772 --> 00:15:27,253
God knows what I really said
to those two flatfeet.

171
00:15:27,323 --> 00:15:30,520
I'm not even sure
how I got out of there.

172
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,619
Did you bring back
tomorrow's bug powder?

173
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,480
Did you, Bill?
Did you?

174
00:15:37,852 --> 00:15:41,594
My God,Joan.
You're acting like a full-fledged junkie.

175
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:45,008
And it's bug powder,
for Christ's sake!

176
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,986
Oh.

177
00:16:00,475 --> 00:16:03,638
I do have a little bit of a habit, yes, hon.

178
00:16:03,739 --> 00:16:07,350
You ought to at least give me
a few marks for originality.

179
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,167
How did you know
it just wouldn't kill you?

180
00:16:11,994 --> 00:16:13,849
I don't know, Bill.

181
00:16:16,571 --> 00:16:18,513
I felt drawn to it.

182
00:16:18,618 --> 00:16:20,722
You know?

183
00:16:20,826 --> 00:16:25,266
Like you feel drawn... to an old lover.

184
00:16:28,314 --> 00:16:30,866
Say, Bill...

185
00:16:30,937 --> 00:16:33,785
could you rub
some of this powder on my lips?

186
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,991
Could you, Bill?

187
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:42,553
Please?

188
00:17:32,696 --> 00:17:34,768
Hey!

189
00:17:36,248 --> 00:17:39,412
Bill.

190
00:17:41,943 --> 00:17:43,853
Hey, where were you this morning?

191
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:45,781
We missed you at the Automat.

192
00:17:46,871 --> 00:17:49,139
I, uh, got in a bit of a jam.

193
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:52,371
I misplaced the gear,
in a manner of speaking.

194
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,773
Yeah.
We heard about it.

195
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:58,515
We saw you go off with the heat, in fact.

196
00:17:59,575 --> 00:18:01,963
They won't give it back to Cohen.

197
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:03,893
It's evidence, they say.

198
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,733
Yeah. It's an embarrassment, yes.

199
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:12,115
Is that why you tried to lift mine?

200
00:18:14,518 --> 00:18:16,622
That's unkind, Edward.

201
00:18:16,727 --> 00:18:19,344
"Lift" is unkind.

202
00:18:20,854 --> 00:18:23,985
I'm doing a job for a friend.

203
00:18:25,013 --> 00:18:29,901
The centipedes, Edward.
The centipedes are getting downright arrogant.

204
00:18:29,973 --> 00:18:31,915
They're starting to attack his children.

205
00:18:32,022 --> 00:18:34,739
Take it from me, Bill.

206
00:18:34,806 --> 00:18:38,417
You're not the first one
to develop a bug powder problem.

207
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,460
See this man.

208
00:18:40,565 --> 00:18:43,314
He'll help ya.

209
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:46,511
"Dr. A. Benway...

210
00:18:46,613 --> 00:18:49,133
General Practitioner."

211
00:18:50,228 --> 00:18:52,050
Bug powder?

212
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:55,150
- You mean, uh, pyrethrum?
- Yes.

213
00:18:56,276 --> 00:19:00,106
Hmm. I get a lot of you folks
in the extermination trade.

214
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,591
You better help this friend of yours
get off the yellow stuff.

215
00:19:04,692 --> 00:19:08,107
- It'll kill him.
- How do I get him to kick?

216
00:19:09,139 --> 00:19:12,238
- Kick?
- H-How do I get him off it?

217
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:14,227
Oh.

218
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,713
Mix it with this.

219
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:22,056
Gradually increase the percentage of black
without telling your friend...

220
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:24,748
and he'll lose his taste
for the bug powder soon enough.

221
00:19:31,506 --> 00:19:33,329
What is it?
What does it do?

222
00:19:33,426 --> 00:19:36,426
Oh, it's all natural.
It's made from, uh...

223
00:19:36,499 --> 00:19:40,077
aquatic Brazilian centipede
or some such outlandish thing.

224
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:44,271
It shuts down the brain's
response to the bug powder. That's all.

225
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:46,226
The powder becomes
irrelevant to the addict...

226
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:48,872
and the addict then
ceases to be addicted.

227
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,532
Side effects?

228
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,513
Nothing that will surprise the addict.

229
00:19:55,604 --> 00:19:58,669
But, uh, before I -
before I do your cure...

230
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,818
I've gotta score some bug powder.

231
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,889
Score?

232
00:20:04,946 --> 00:20:08,077
You're not trying to... pull a fast one
on the old doctor, are you?

233
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:10,000
I came here for help.

234
00:20:11,474 --> 00:20:13,416
Of course you did.

235
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,313
Phew!

236
00:20:19,378 --> 00:20:21,233
My God.

237
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:25,073
It smells like a... tainted cheese.

238
00:20:27,474 --> 00:20:30,256
You'll see how elegantly this works.

239
00:20:31,921 --> 00:20:33,809
The black will disappear completely.

240
00:20:42,161 --> 00:20:44,549
And there'll be no smell,
no discoloration.

241
00:20:46,032 --> 00:20:47,855
It's like an agent -

242
00:20:47,952 --> 00:20:50,440
an agent who's come to believe
his own cover story...

243
00:20:50,512 --> 00:20:53,360
but who's in there, hiding...

244
00:20:53,616 --> 00:20:55,885
in a larval state...

245
00:20:55,983 --> 00:20:58,799
just waiting
for the proper moment to hatch out.

246
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:14,214
Extra, extra.! Read all about it.!

247
00:21:35,342 --> 00:21:37,382
Thirty-nine cents,just for today.! Special.

248
00:21:37,486 --> 00:21:39,690
Thirty-nine cents.
Fresh cabbage.

249
00:21:53,486 --> 00:21:55,689
Centipedes.

250

263
00:23:09,483 --> 00:23:12,800
Hi, Bill.

264
00:23:14,252 --> 00:23:16,226
Say, why don't you and I join them?

265
00:23:53,033 --> 00:23:55,848
Hank and I were just bored.
It wasn't serious.

266
00:23:55,914 --> 00:23:57,768
I didn't take it seriously.

267
00:23:57,834 --> 00:23:59,742
Where is Hank?

268
00:23:59,849 --> 00:24:01,922
He got embarrassed and left.

269
00:24:03,114 --> 00:24:05,001
Not before he came, I hope.

270
00:24:05,097 --> 00:24:07,463
Hank's on junk.
He doesn't come.

271
00:24:09,226 --> 00:24:11,429
Not before you came, I hope.

272
00:24:11,497 --> 00:24:15,142
I'm on bug powder.
I don't need to come.

273
00:24:15,241 --> 00:24:19,431
"Officials of unconstituted police states...

279
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:43,517
I guess it's about time
for our William Tell routine.

280
00:25:21,255 --> 00:25:23,110
Oh, God.

281
00:25:23,175 --> 00:25:25,030
Oh, God.

282
00:25:28,935 --> 00:25:30,877
Joan.

283
00:25:30,983 --> 00:25:32,871
Joan.

284
00:25:35,814 --> 00:25:37,702
Oh,Joan.

285
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:19,870
Are you a faggot?

286
00:26:25,796 --> 00:26:28,644
Not by nature, no.

287
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,627
I'm not.

288
00:26:31,813 --> 00:26:34,714
I wouldn't say... faggot.

289
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,868
No.

290
00:26:38,628 --> 00:26:43,101
However, circumstances have forced me
to consider the possibility that -

291
00:26:46,595 --> 00:26:49,497
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.

292
00:26:49,603 --> 00:26:51,774
He specializes in sexual ambivalence.

293
00:26:53,891 --> 00:26:55,746
Sexual ambulance, did you say?

294
00:27:01,923 --> 00:27:03,778
My God.

295
00:27:03,874 --> 00:27:05,697
He's called Mugwump.

296
00:27:09,603 --> 00:27:11,642
No point in feigning surprise.

297
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:14,617
You knew we would be
getting in touch with you.

298
00:27:14,722 --> 00:27:18,333
Why else would you come
to a waterfront dive like this?

299
00:27:19,394 --> 00:27:21,217
Why else?

300
00:27:21,314 --> 00:27:24,216
I suggest a Clark Nova portable.

301
00:27:24,321 --> 00:27:26,558
It has mythic resonance.

302
00:27:26,818 --> 00:27:30,134
Clark Nova. A typewriter?
You suggest it for what?

303
00:27:30,209 --> 00:27:33,471
For your report
from Interzone, of course.

304
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:36,798
Handwriting is not
considered professional.

305
00:27:36,897 --> 00:27:38,752
Interzone.

306
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,665
My report.

307
00:27:41,762 --> 00:27:45,591
And don't leave out
any of the tasty details -

308
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:48,086
the small red hole in the forehead...

309
00:27:48,194 --> 00:27:50,016
or...

310
00:27:50,114 --> 00:27:52,448
the look of astonishment on her face.

311
00:27:54,689 --> 00:27:58,551
Listen to me.
You'rejust gonna have to leave town...

312
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:00,480
and Interzone is the only place...

313
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:03,872
that'll have a shady character
like you at such short notice.

314
00:28:03,936 --> 00:28:05,791
Take this.

315
00:28:05,856 --> 00:28:08,671
Take what?
What is that?

316
00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:11,136
Your ticket to Interzone.

317
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:13,437
Tourist class, I'm afraid...

318
00:28:13,537 --> 00:28:16,253
but what can you expect these days?

319
00:28:17,665 --> 00:28:19,966
We'll contact you there.

320
00:28:53,694 --> 00:28:56,083
Hmm. It's commie trash.

321
00:28:57,151 --> 00:28:59,093
And it's been fired very recently.

322
00:28:59,198 --> 00:29:01,205
You use it in a holdup?

323
00:29:03,071 --> 00:29:06,234
I want that-that typewriter in the window.
I want the portable.

324
00:29:10,686 --> 00:29:12,595
This plus...

325
00:29:12,702 --> 00:29:14,589
$8.00.

326
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:18,171
You got any ammo to go with it?

327
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,278
These'll cover the state tax.

328
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:36,732
- Bill.
- Martin.

329
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:42,170
Listen, Bill, I told the police
it was a drunken accident, that I saw it.

330
00:29:42,237 --> 00:29:44,539
So at least that's on the record.
They're after you though.

331
00:29:44,637 --> 00:29:47,157
They're saying that -
that you escaped from custody...

332
00:29:47,261 --> 00:29:50,577
and murdered your wife,
and-and they want you.

333
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:55,002
I'd better-
I'd better lie low till my ship sails.

334
00:29:55,101 --> 00:29:58,416
- You booked passage somewhere already?
- Sure. Look.

335
00:29:58,524 --> 00:30:00,858
Got my ticket.

336
00:30:00,955 --> 00:30:04,022
Put this away,
for God's sake, Bill.

337
00:30:04,124 --> 00:30:06,360
- I'll send you a report.
- You'll send me a report?

338
00:30:06,459 --> 00:30:09,394
Well, I'll send you
a copy of the report.

339
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:12,053
Are you gonna be all right?

340
00:30:13,883 --> 00:30:15,924
I hear Interzone's really nice
this time of year.

341
00:31:08,793 --> 00:31:10,833
He woke up in bed...

342
00:31:10,907 --> 00:31:13,524
to find himself wedged...

343
00:31:13,627 --> 00:31:15,481
between a Dutch transvestite...

344
00:31:15,578 --> 00:31:19,025
and six Arab men.

345
00:31:20,314 --> 00:31:22,168
Clark Nova.

346
00:31:23,257 --> 00:31:25,297
Very nice for writing reports.

347
00:31:27,897 --> 00:31:31,574
I use a Krups Dominator myself.

348
00:31:33,593 --> 00:31:35,732
Company policy.

349
00:31:44,824 --> 00:31:46,712
You're American, correct?

350
00:31:48,985 --> 00:31:50,893
You know Dr. Benway?

351
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:56,560
I am interested in selling...

352
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,606
a large stash of the black meat.

353
00:31:58,711 --> 00:32:00,534
Verstehen Sie?

354
00:32:00,631 --> 00:32:03,282
The sun-dried, powdered black meat...

355
00:32:03,384 --> 00:32:08,021
of the giant aquatic Brazilian centipede.

356
00:32:08,087 --> 00:32:09,975
And...

357
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:14,006
for some reason...

358
00:32:14,104 --> 00:32:19,057
I am certain that you are working
for Herr Dr. Benway.

359
00:32:22,456 --> 00:32:24,495
I'm - I-I-I'm sorry.

360
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:26,704
I apparently mistook you
for somebody else.

361
00:32:26,966 --> 00:32:30,283
But as it happens, Mr. Lee,
I am, among other things...

362
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:33,651
a provider of rare services to the arts...

363
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:38,507
and in my experience
as a provider of rare services to the arts...

364
00:32:38,615 --> 00:32:41,713
I have found that writers
are a-a particularly needy group.

365
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:45,903
Is there nothing
I can provide for you...

366
00:32:47,126 --> 00:32:48,784
Mr. Lee?

367
00:33:18,453 --> 00:33:21,006
A very professional...

368
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,932
operation...

369
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:25,932
as you can see, Mr. Lee.

370
00:33:28,438 --> 00:33:30,226
You like a taste?

371
00:33:31,541 --> 00:33:35,087
I'd be happy to join you in a taste,
if you're planning to have one.

372
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:57,482
You can understand
that if you were...

373
00:33:57,588 --> 00:34:01,898
a purchasing agent
for a foreign power...

374
00:34:02,003 --> 00:34:04,851
how it would be
to my advantage...

375
00:34:04,948 --> 00:34:08,209
to impress you with the cleanliness...

376
00:34:08,307 --> 00:34:11,024
and the sincerity...

377
00:34:11,124 --> 00:34:13,099
of our operation.

378
00:34:15,412 --> 00:34:18,673
- You, uh, mentioned a Dr. -
- Benway.

379
00:34:18,771 --> 00:34:21,291
- Benway.
- Benway. Correct.

380
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:23,250
Yes.

381
00:34:24,307 --> 00:34:26,162
Does he qualify as a foreign power?

382
00:34:26,258 --> 00:34:30,055
Oh, but yes!
He's very foreign.

383
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,864
May I?

384
00:34:45,235 --> 00:34:47,121
Yes.

385
00:35:43,568 --> 00:35:46,471
Lee, wake up.

386
00:35:46,576 --> 00:35:48,430
This is no time to doze off...

387
00:35:48,496 --> 00:35:51,878
like a freckled-face boy
on a fishing raft.

388
00:35:56,464 --> 00:35:58,287
What's up?

389
00:36:04,015 --> 00:36:07,495
Now, now, Bill.
No need for that.

390
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,895
You didn't think
we'd abandon you, did ya?

391
00:36:10,991 --> 00:36:14,252
No, no. The thought
never occurred to me.

392
00:36:14,352 --> 00:36:17,068
Good. We like confidence in an agent.

393
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:19,949
But don't let it make you careless.

394
00:36:20,047 --> 00:36:21,869
I was, uh -

395
00:36:21,967 --> 00:36:24,236
I was just in the...

396
00:36:25,263 --> 00:36:28,045
process of configuring my report.

397
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:32,004
That's good, Lee. Admirable.

398
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,380
But there have been some changes -

399
00:36:34,447 --> 00:36:36,934
- Changes at the top.
- Oh? Yeah?

400
00:36:37,038 --> 00:36:40,781
Good changes, Bill.
Fresh blood. Sparkling insights.

401
00:36:42,286 --> 00:36:46,082
Uh, Bill, could you do me a favor?

402
00:36:48,302 --> 00:36:50,124
What?

403
00:36:51,405 --> 00:36:54,024
I want you to type
a few words into me -

404
00:36:54,126 --> 00:36:56,166
words that I'll dictate to ya.

405
00:36:59,021 --> 00:37:00,931
Yeah.

406
00:37:02,445 --> 00:37:04,300
Sure. What the hell.

407
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:16,937
Okay. Now, the first sentence is...

408
00:37:17,036 --> 00:37:21,892
"Homosexuality is the best
all-around cover an agent ever had."

409
00:37:23,435 --> 00:37:25,705
Aw, come on, Bill.

410
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,548
Don't be such a pansy!
Be forceful.

411
00:37:32,652 --> 00:37:34,856
Hurt me.

412
00:37:45,484 --> 00:37:47,622
I love it.

413
00:37:47,691 --> 00:37:51,433
That is a great sentence.

414
00:37:51,531 --> 00:37:54,498
These are words to live by, Bill.

415
00:37:54,604 --> 00:37:58,019
I'm glad these words
are going into your report.

416
00:37:58,123 --> 00:38:01,122
Our new management will be so pleased...

417
00:38:01,227 --> 00:38:03,648
that you see our point of view.

418
00:38:06,186 --> 00:38:08,041
What -What point of view?

419
00:38:08,138 --> 00:38:11,238
Well, uh,just that we appreciate...

420
00:38:11,307 --> 00:38:16,642
that you might find the thought
of engaging in, uh, homosexual acts...

421
00:38:16,746 --> 00:38:20,391
morally and, uh, possibly even...

422
00:38:20,491 --> 00:38:22,694
physically repulsive...

423
00:38:22,796 --> 00:38:25,697
and, uh, we are encouraged...

424
00:38:25,802 --> 00:38:29,992
that you are able to overcome
these personal, uh, barriers...

425
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:34,400
to better serve the cause
to which we are all so devoted.

426
00:38:48,714 --> 00:38:51,781
You have left the Clark Nova at home?

427
00:38:53,129 --> 00:38:55,399
It's doing all right without me.

428
00:39:04,457 --> 00:39:06,312
And, uh...

429
00:39:07,368 --> 00:39:11,230
you have contacted Dr. Benway?

430
00:39:13,961 --> 00:39:15,903
I told you before
I never met the man.

431
00:39:16,008 --> 00:39:19,357
Bill, I can smell him on you.

432
00:39:20,521 --> 00:39:24,066
Benway marks out all those
whom he has met like a lemur...

433
00:39:24,168 --> 00:39:27,397
pissing on a liana vine
to mark his territory.

434
00:39:28,647 --> 00:39:30,470
You're a marked man, Bill.

435
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,789
Joanie.

436
00:39:41,895 --> 00:39:44,612
Joanie, shall we go?

437
00:39:44,711 --> 00:39:46,533
Yes. Yes.

438
00:39:53,127 --> 00:39:57,022
Hans. Hans, that couple.

439
00:39:57,126 --> 00:39:59,198
Who are they?

440
00:39:59,302 --> 00:40:02,150
They are Tom and Joan Frost.

441
00:40:03,142 --> 00:40:06,687
Americans who have lived here
a very long time.

442
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:08,830
They're both writers.

443
00:40:08,934 --> 00:40:11,553
Writers of fiction, like you.

444
00:40:13,382 --> 00:40:15,389
They live in a nice flat...

445
00:40:15,463 --> 00:40:17,884
in the new building
at the foot of the mountain.

446
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:20,707
They're visited constantly...

447
00:40:20,773 --> 00:40:24,122
by many handsome,
young Interzone men.

448
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,401
Sometimes...

449
00:40:26,502 --> 00:40:29,916
two or three at a time.

450
00:40:31,237 --> 00:40:32,928
Can you, uh, introduce me?

451
00:40:33,157 --> 00:40:38,339
I do not think
it would be to your advantage.

452
00:40:39,462 --> 00:40:41,283
For some reason...

453
00:40:41,382 --> 00:40:45,756
that woman has taken
a serious dislike to me.

454
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:47,685
Kiki.

455
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,717
Come sit with us.

456
00:40:56,613 --> 00:40:59,548
Kiki, this is Mr. Lee.

457
00:40:59,621 --> 00:41:01,563
Hello.

458
00:41:01,669 --> 00:41:05,498
Mr. Lee is curious about the Frost couple.

459
00:41:05,765 --> 00:41:08,001
He would like to meet them.

460
00:41:08,101 --> 00:41:10,523
I think the woman would have
sex with you, Mr. Lee.

461
00:41:11,716 --> 00:41:15,491
The man, he only likes Interzone boys.

462
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:20,161
I don't want to fuck 'em.
I just want to talk to 'em.

463
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,748
You know how
Americans are, Kiki.

464
00:41:22,852 --> 00:41:24,740
They love to travel...

465
00:41:24,996 --> 00:41:28,062
and then they only want to meet
other Americans...

466
00:41:28,164 --> 00:41:32,801
and talk about how hard it is
to get a decent hamburger.

467
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,747
There's a party tonight at the O'Leary place.

468
00:41:35,844 --> 00:41:38,746
Frost will be meeting
a group of us here...

469
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,307
and then walking
through the casbah.

470
00:41:41,411 --> 00:41:43,899
My friends and I would be happy
to take you with us.

471
00:41:46,818 --> 00:41:49,884
You're the new writer, aren't you?
You've just arrived.

472
00:41:49,987 --> 00:41:53,053
A few days ago.
I write, uh, reports.

473
00:41:53,154 --> 00:41:56,897
Oh? Uh, and did you
come to Interzone for the boys?

474
00:41:58,723 --> 00:42:01,025
- No, I didn't.
- Tom and I did.

475
00:42:01,122 --> 00:42:03,392
That's quite a hot threesome
you arrived with.

476
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:07,134
They're very cheap,
and they're really a lot of fun.

477
00:42:10,147 --> 00:42:12,001
Yoo-hoo!

478
00:42:16,738 --> 00:42:19,225
You use a Clark Nova, don't you?

479
00:42:22,786 --> 00:42:24,891
To write with. Typewriter.

480
00:42:24,961 --> 00:42:26,816
Oh, I do. Yes.

481
00:42:26,881 --> 00:42:29,466
I wouldn't use a Clark Nova myself.

482
00:42:29,569 --> 00:42:32,318
- Too demanding.
- Demanding?

483
00:42:33,409 --> 00:42:36,278
Oh, come on. We're both writers.
We know what we're talking about.

484
00:42:37,473 --> 00:42:40,375
Well, I'm new to this game,
to tell you the truth.

485
00:42:41,665 --> 00:42:45,048
If I get blocked again,
I'll let you try my Martinelli.

486
00:42:46,177 --> 00:42:48,152
Her inventiveness will surprise you.

487
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,775
I can't wait.

488
00:42:53,472 --> 00:42:55,327
They say you murdered your wife.

489
00:42:57,088 --> 00:42:59,390
- Is that true?
- Who told you that?

490
00:42:59,487 --> 00:43:01,789
Word gets around.

491
00:43:01,889 --> 00:43:05,020
It wasn't murder.
It was an accident.

492
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,999
There are no accidents.

493
00:43:11,871 --> 00:43:14,238
For example...

494
00:43:15,743 --> 00:43:18,612
I've been killing my own wife slowly,
over a period of years.

495
00:43:18,718 --> 00:43:20,988
- What?
- Well, not intentionally.

496
00:43:21,087 --> 00:43:25,146
I mean, on the level of conscious intention,
it's insane, monstrous.

497
00:43:25,247 --> 00:43:28,859
But you do consciously know it.
You just said it. We're discussing it.

498
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,902
Not consciously.

499
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,540
This is all happening...
telepathically.

500
00:43:35,648 --> 00:43:38,517
- Nonconsciously.
- What do you mean?

501
00:43:40,255 --> 00:43:42,743
If you look carefully at my lips...

502
00:43:42,847 --> 00:43:45,531
you'll realize
that I'm actually saying something else.

503
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,381
I'm not actually telling you
about the several ways...

504
00:43:48,478 --> 00:43:50,388
I'm gradually murdering Joan -

505
00:43:50,495 --> 00:43:52,884
about the housekeeper Fadela,
whom I've hired...

506
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:55,676
to makeJoan deathly ill by witchcraft...

507
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,879
about the medicines
and drugs I've given her...

508
00:43:59,135 --> 00:44:03,194
about the constant nibbling away
at her self-esteem and sanity...

509
00:44:03,294 --> 00:44:06,742
that I've managed
without being at all obvious about it.

510
00:44:08,223 --> 00:44:11,899
Whereas Joanie finds that she simply...

511
00:44:11,998 --> 00:44:14,419
cannot be as obsessively precise
as she wants to be...

512
00:44:14,494 --> 00:44:18,650
unless she writes
everything in longhand.

513
00:44:20,765 --> 00:44:23,635
Look, uh, I'm afraid, um...

514
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:29,245
I'm not gonna be
very good company tonight.

515
00:44:29,341 --> 00:44:32,637
Thanks for the invite anyway.
I think I'll - I'll have to take a rain check.

516
00:44:36,028 --> 00:44:37,916
Oh.

517
00:44:51,292 --> 00:44:53,147
Enjoying the beach?

518
00:44:57,884 --> 00:45:02,074
I would never have expected
to see you up and out so early.

519
00:45:03,197 --> 00:45:06,163
You certainly were in rough shape
at the O'Leary party last night.

520
00:45:06,235 --> 00:45:08,602
Was I?

521
00:45:11,547 --> 00:45:15,125
You were very raw -
emotionally, I mean.

522
00:45:15,195 --> 00:45:18,391
You seemed to be in a lot of pain.

523
00:45:18,491 --> 00:45:20,313
Pain.

524
00:45:21,915 --> 00:45:25,013
I don't remember... pain.

525
00:45:26,139 --> 00:45:30,547
And, in fact, I don't remember
the O'Leary party.

526
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:34,002
In fact, I don't remember you.

527
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:38,160
Well, it was a very intense
performance in any case.

528
00:45:39,642 --> 00:45:41,464
My name's Cloquet.

529
00:45:47,194 --> 00:45:49,048
Yves Cloquet.

530
00:45:51,034 --> 00:45:53,522
Can I buy you breakfast?

531
00:46:03,514 --> 00:46:06,962
I've seen you around,
but I had no idea you were queer.

532
00:46:09,049 --> 00:46:10,904
Queer.

533
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:14,265
I saw you arrive
with those three Interzone boys.

534
00:46:14,362 --> 00:46:16,217
What an entrance.

535
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:18,545
You all looked very...

536
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,559
familiar with each other.

537
00:46:21,721 --> 00:46:23,608
Queer.

538
00:46:25,177 --> 00:46:27,763
A curse.
Been in our family for generations.

539
00:46:28,026 --> 00:46:30,611
The Lees have always been perverts.

540
00:46:32,601 --> 00:46:36,398
I shall never forget
the unspeakable horror...

541
00:46:36,666 --> 00:46:40,014
that froze the lymph in my glands...

542
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:44,822
when the baneful word seared
my reeling brain -

543
00:46:44,889 --> 00:46:46,797
I...

544
00:46:46,905 --> 00:46:48,759
was a homosexual.

545
00:46:50,232 --> 00:46:53,528
I thought of the painted,
simpering female impersonators...

546
00:46:53,624 --> 00:46:55,893
I had seen in a Baltimore nightclub.

547
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:01,521
Could it be possible
I was one of those subhuman things?

548
00:47:04,823 --> 00:47:06,830
I walked the streets in a daze...

549
00:47:06,936 --> 00:47:09,424
like a man with a light concussion.

550
00:47:09,527 --> 00:47:12,080
I would have destroyed myself-

551
00:47:13,304 --> 00:47:15,191
But a wise old queen-

552
00:47:16,471 --> 00:47:19,188
Bobo, we called her-

553
00:47:20,216 --> 00:47:22,070
taught me that I had a duty...

554
00:47:22,167 --> 00:47:26,510
to live and to bear my burden
proudly for all to see.

555
00:47:28,056 --> 00:47:30,543
Poor Bobo came to a sticky end.

556
00:47:31,895 --> 00:47:35,757
He was riding in
the Duc de Ventre's Hispano-Suiza...

557
00:47:36,758 --> 00:47:39,376
when his falling hemorrhoids
blew out of the car...

558
00:47:39,478 --> 00:47:41,845
and wrapped around the rear wheel.

559
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:45,772
He was completely gutted,
leaving an empty shell...

560
00:47:45,878 --> 00:47:49,194
sitting there
on the giraffe-skin upholstery.

561
00:47:54,006 --> 00:47:55,827
Even the eyes and the brain went...

562
00:47:55,925 --> 00:47:59,155
with a horrible "schlupping" sound.

563
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:06,033
The duke says he will carry that ghastly
schlup with him to his mausoleum.

564
00:48:09,941 --> 00:48:13,619
You sound as if you could use a drink.
My place?

565
00:48:14,708 --> 00:48:16,596
A drink.

566
00:48:21,589 --> 00:48:23,476
A drink?

567
00:48:24,564 --> 00:48:26,386
No.

568
00:48:26,484 --> 00:48:29,201
No, I can't. I gotta go home.

569
00:48:29,268 --> 00:48:31,723
I have a -
I have a -

570
00:48:31,828 --> 00:48:33,900
I have a report to write.
Excuse me.

571
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,989
Hmm.

572
00:50:35,663 --> 00:50:38,380
You made a big hit
with our young friend Yves.

573
00:50:43,247 --> 00:50:45,735
- Yves?
- Cloquet.

574
00:50:48,047 --> 00:50:51,081
Yves said you were wonderfully funny.

575
00:50:51,183 --> 00:50:55,787
Said you did a little routine that made him...
chuckle to himself all day.

576
00:51:01,807 --> 00:51:03,694
Yes, you-you could, um -

577
00:51:05,678 --> 00:51:08,744
You could probably get him into bed
if you worked at it a bit.

578
00:51:09,006 --> 00:51:12,169
Deadly aphrodisiac, humor.

579
00:51:12,271 --> 00:51:14,375
I'm not, uh -

580
00:51:14,478 --> 00:51:16,714
I don't really-

581
00:51:19,566 --> 00:51:21,421
Have you seen Hans around?

582
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:24,301
Oh, you mean you haven't heard?

583
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:28,779
No. I haven't heard.

584
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:31,333
Hans was arrested and deported
two weeks ago.

585
00:51:33,262 --> 00:51:35,149
- Deported.
- Mm-hmm.

586
00:51:37,518 --> 00:51:39,820
They let him take his clothes
and his passport.

587
00:51:39,918 --> 00:51:43,464
That was it.
Everything else - nationalized, as they say.

588
00:51:44,654 --> 00:51:46,476
Why?

589
00:51:46,574 --> 00:51:50,349
He neglected to pay
the right officials, I think.

590
00:51:50,414 --> 00:51:52,748
You knew he ran
a drug factory in the medina?

591
00:51:56,717 --> 00:51:59,139
What, um -

592
00:52:01,965 --> 00:52:03,787
What drug did he manufacture?

593
00:52:03,885 --> 00:52:06,024
Nothing too exotic.

594
00:52:06,125 --> 00:52:10,380
Majoun, I think.
It's a local hash resin-almond paste.

595
00:52:10,445 --> 00:52:12,354
You'd spread it on a muffin likejam.

596
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,762
Try it.

597
00:52:27,724 --> 00:52:30,538
While you're at it,
why don't you try my Martinelli?

598
00:52:33,933 --> 00:52:35,787
Take her now.

599
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:39,467
Try her out.

600
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,621
Holy shit. That machine doesn't
belong to me. It's Tom Frost's.

601
00:54:27,719 --> 00:54:29,542
My God, Lee...

602
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:32,956
Surely you know better than to bring
an enemy agent into your own home.

603
00:54:33,064 --> 00:54:38,115
You gave me no choice. You were giving her
access to your innermost vulnerabilities...

604
00:54:38,216 --> 00:54:40,103
forcing them on her,
for God's sake!

605
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:42,054
But what am I gonna tell him?

606
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:44,158
What's your assessment of the situation?

607
00:54:44,264 --> 00:54:47,133
Did Frost know that his machine
was an Interzonal agent?

608
00:54:49,927 --> 00:54:54,050
He, uh - He and his wife
appear to have a close connection...

609
00:54:54,151 --> 00:54:56,801
with the indigenous population here.

610
00:54:59,207 --> 00:55:01,149
His wife.
Yeah, yeah!

611
00:55:01,255 --> 00:55:04,102
Of course!
The key is Joan Frost.

612
00:55:04,198 --> 00:55:08,507
You will seduce her, and you will discover
the substance of her report...

613
00:55:08,774 --> 00:55:10,814
and deliver it directly to me.

614
00:55:10,917 --> 00:55:13,056
Seduce her?
But what about -

615
00:55:13,126 --> 00:55:15,745
What about Kiki and
the Interzone boys? My cover.

616
00:55:15,846 --> 00:55:19,588
It'll work beautifully, Bill.
The opposition will be thrown into total confusion.

617
00:56:08,038 --> 00:56:11,300
- Tom's gone out with the boys.
- I came to see you.

618
00:56:12,901 --> 00:56:15,006
Oh.

619
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:36,219
There's a great restaurant
in New York looks just like this.

620
00:56:36,325 --> 00:56:38,180
Oh, really?

621
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:51,488
- You write in longhand.
- Yes.

622
00:56:52,549 --> 00:56:55,712
I'm not good with machines.
They intimidate me.

623
00:56:55,972 --> 00:56:57,663
I think I broke Tom's typewriter.

624
00:56:57,924 --> 00:57:01,153
The Martinelli?
He'll be furious.

625
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:05,627
- Does he have another one?
- He has that one, the Mujahideen.

626
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,929
- It's Arabic.
- Does he use it much?

627
00:57:09,029 --> 00:57:11,298
Not much.

628
00:57:11,397 --> 00:57:13,251
What happened to the Martinelli?

629
00:57:13,348 --> 00:57:16,731
I probably just
threw it on the floor and smashed it.

630
00:57:16,836 --> 00:57:19,072
Probably? You don't know?

631
00:57:19,172 --> 00:57:21,311
I suffer from, um...

632
00:57:21,411 --> 00:57:23,299
sporadic hallucinations.

633
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:27,395
Join the club.

634
00:57:31,556 --> 00:57:33,890
Do you intend to kill Tom's Mujahideen?

635
00:57:35,779 --> 00:57:37,634
Only in self-defense.

636
00:57:37,699 --> 00:57:39,837
I understood writing
could be dangerous.

637
00:57:40,099 --> 00:57:42,433
I didn't realize the danger
came from the machinery.

638
00:57:43,427 --> 00:57:45,533
- What are you talking about?
- I'll show you.

639
00:57:45,636 --> 00:57:47,458
Oh.

640
00:57:54,563 --> 00:57:56,897
- Are you gonna write something in Arabic?
- No.

641
00:57:58,691 --> 00:58:00,731
You are.

642
00:58:00,835 --> 00:58:04,544
I don't like using Tom's things.

643
00:58:04,643 --> 00:58:07,130
We don't trespass on each other.

644
00:58:09,155 --> 00:58:12,057
Do you have any objection
to trying some of this?

645
00:58:14,914 --> 00:58:17,631
I can't read it.
Is it erotic?

646
00:58:17,697 --> 00:58:19,737
It's, um, fairly erotic.

647
00:58:19,842 --> 00:58:21,664
- Kind of uncivilized.
- More erotic.

648
00:58:23,618 --> 00:58:25,822
Filthier.

649
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:29,534
- Filthier? Okay.
- All you think about.

650
00:58:31,426 --> 00:58:35,201
- Followers of obsolete, unthinkable trades...
- Getting really...

651
00:58:35,298 --> 00:58:37,851
- pretty good here.
- doodling in Etruscan...

652
00:58:37,954 --> 00:58:41,882
- addicts of drugs not yet synthesized...
- I'm surpassing myself here.

653
00:58:41,986 --> 00:58:44,441
black marketeers of World War III...

654
00:58:44,545 --> 00:58:46,847
excisors of telepathic sensitivity...

655
00:58:46,946 --> 00:58:50,241
followers of obsolete,
unthinkable trades.

656
00:58:50,305 --> 00:58:53,152
Ooh, this is very good.

657
00:58:53,249 --> 00:58:56,118
- Addicts of drugs not yet synthesized-
- Very, very dirty.

658
00:58:58,401 --> 00:59:01,271
World War III...

659
00:59:01,378 --> 00:59:04,160
excisors of telepathic sensitivity...

660
00:59:05,186 --> 00:59:07,673
osteopaths of the spirit...

661
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:11,290
investigators of infractions...

662
00:59:11,393 --> 00:59:15,419
denounced by bland,
paranoid chess players.

663
00:59:30,208 --> 00:59:32,030
Joan.

664
00:59:32,128 --> 00:59:34,015
Oh,Joan.

665
00:59:58,207 --> 00:59:59,865
Mrs. Frost!

666
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:02,713
This is an evil
and insane thing that you are doing.

667
01:00:02,815 --> 01:00:05,052
You must stop it at once!

668
01:00:10,751 --> 01:00:12,638
Pull up your hair.

669
01:00:17,728 --> 01:00:19,550
Who's that?

670
01:00:19,648 --> 01:00:21,502
Oh, my housekeeper.

671
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:19,997
It's my Mujahideen.

672
01:01:23,741 --> 01:01:26,196
For God's sake!

673
01:01:37,053 --> 01:01:39,475
Itjumped of its own accord.

674
01:01:39,581 --> 01:01:41,785
You did see that, didn't you?

675
01:01:45,181 --> 01:01:47,570
Joan, are you all right?
What happened?

676
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:52,497
Fadela stormed in here, and-and
she threw your typewriter out the window.

677
01:01:53,789 --> 01:01:55,698
Well, that's it.
The woman has to go.

678
01:01:55,805 --> 01:01:58,521
She certainly seemed deadly to me.

679
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:01,882
Oh, I knew it.

680
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:05,172
Look, Tom.

681
01:02:05,276 --> 01:02:07,163
Look.

682
01:02:09,948 --> 01:02:12,796
This is how Fadela's
been controlling you,Joan.

683
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:16,275
Your blood, your pubic hair,
your fingernails.

684
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:18,584
Fadela controls nobody,
and you know it.

685
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:20,539
We have forced control upon her.

686
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:23,057
Poor woman's probably desperate
to get out of our household.

687
01:02:23,132 --> 01:02:25,849
No, missus.
She's making you say everything...

688
01:02:25,948 --> 01:02:27,770
even that.

689
01:02:27,868 --> 01:02:31,064
You must find all of these in your house.
You must destroy them.

690
01:02:33,948 --> 01:02:36,697
Bill...

691
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:38,682
I'm going to need my Martinelli.

692
01:02:40,827 --> 01:02:43,675
I feel desperately insecure
without a typewriter in the house.

693
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:48,308
Yes, well, I haven't had a chance to try it out
yet, Tom. I was kind of hoping -

694
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:51,258
I'll leave Hafid here with you,Joanie,
in case Fadela comes back.

695
01:02:51,355 --> 01:02:55,152
Bill and I will go to his place
and pick up the Martinelli now.

696
01:02:55,259 --> 01:02:57,201
I'll go with Bill.
You two stay here.

697
01:02:57,307 --> 01:02:59,129
I need to get out.

698
01:03:15,354 --> 01:03:18,670
Fadela's within 30 feet of us.
See if you can find her.

699
01:03:26,554 --> 01:03:28,594
There.

700
01:03:28,666 --> 01:03:30,554
She's right there.

701
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:41,231
That thing she's cutting up...

702
01:03:43,002 --> 01:03:44,944
have you ever seen that before?

703
01:03:45,049 --> 01:03:46,958
No.

704
01:03:47,066 --> 01:03:49,935
Looks like some kind of
sea creature, I think.

705
01:03:50,042 --> 01:03:52,791
All those women...

706
01:03:52,889 --> 01:03:55,125
they work for her?

707
01:03:55,225 --> 01:03:58,520
In a sense.
They're all Fadela's lovers.

708
01:04:05,401 --> 01:04:08,085
I'm going to have to -

709
01:04:08,186 --> 01:04:11,731
I'm gonna have to
stay here with Fadela -

710
01:04:11,833 --> 01:04:13,807
do penance.

711
01:06:21,493 --> 01:06:23,468
I've been instructed to reveal to you...

712
01:06:23,733 --> 01:06:26,995
that you were programmed
to shoot your wife,Joan Lee.

713
01:06:27,093 --> 01:06:30,027
It was not an act
of free will on your part.

714
01:06:31,636 --> 01:06:33,524
Hey!

715
01:06:35,509 --> 01:06:37,745
Who the fuck asked ya?

716
01:06:39,636 --> 01:06:41,547
You worry me, Bill.

717
01:06:41,653 --> 01:06:44,948
You cause me many anxious moments.

718
01:06:45,045 --> 01:06:47,794
Oh, gee, I hope you're not
losing any sleep.

719
01:06:47,861 --> 01:06:49,868
No need to be nasty, Bill.

720
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:53,682
There was some thought that you might
actually want to hear this information -

721
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:56,814
that it might assuage your guilt.

722
01:06:56,916 --> 01:07:01,455
Save the psychoanalysis
for your grasshopper friends.

723
01:07:01,524 --> 01:07:05,648
You have to admit,
it was a pretty tasty setup, Bill.

724
01:07:05,716 --> 01:07:08,367
Joan marries you as part
ofher agent's cover...

725
01:07:08,436 --> 01:07:12,396
not realizing that you were
the very enemy agent assigned to kill her.

726
01:07:12,659 --> 01:07:15,692
As elegant as it is brilliant.

727
01:07:24,628 --> 01:07:26,516
Wait a minute.

728
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:32,846
You're saying thatJoan was sent
by Interzone, Incorporated to marry me?

729
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:37,901
Yeah. In fact, she was sent
to you by Fadela, who was her controller.

730
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:41,615
We did a lot of groundwork
to set you up in their files...

731
01:07:41,683 --> 01:07:43,788
as the prime candidate for marriage.

732
01:07:43,891 --> 01:07:47,239
And it didn't matter that
I didn't know anything about it?

733
01:07:47,314 --> 01:07:50,380
An unconscious agent
is an effective agent, Bill.

734
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:55,119
The situation does generate
some ethical paradoxes at times.

735
01:07:55,218 --> 01:07:57,225
I'm the first to admit that.

736
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:01,871
When you bugs first approached me...

737
01:08:03,475 --> 01:08:06,061
one of your associates suggested...

738
01:08:06,162 --> 01:08:09,162
thatJoan was possibly not human.

739
01:08:10,195 --> 01:08:12,333
What did he mean by that?

740
01:08:12,434 --> 01:08:14,987
Women aren't human, Bill.

741
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:16,945
Or perhaps more precisely...

742
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:18,985
they're a different species from men...

743
01:08:19,090 --> 01:08:22,735
with different wills
and different purposes on Earth.

744
01:08:22,802 --> 01:08:24,711
You know this instinctively, Bill...

745
01:08:24,817 --> 01:08:28,363
and it's your instincts
that make you such a good operative.

746
01:08:29,394 --> 01:08:31,401
I'm talking aboutJoan.

747
01:08:34,385 --> 01:08:36,296
IfJoan Lee wasn't human...

748
01:08:37,746 --> 01:08:39,600
what was she?

749
01:08:39,666 --> 01:08:42,927
Well,Joan was a special case.

750
01:08:44,146 --> 01:08:46,863
Joan was an elite-corps centipede.

751
01:08:50,258 --> 01:08:52,112
Joan was a centipede.

752
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:01,354
Where's my Martinelli?

753
01:09:01,457 --> 01:09:04,326
Jesus, Tom, are you nuts?

754
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:07,367
Don't fuck with me, Lee.
I want my typewriter.

755
01:09:08,432 --> 01:09:10,799
A lot of people have tried to silence me.

756
01:09:11,952 --> 01:09:13,959
All have failed.

757
01:09:14,032 --> 01:09:16,105
Tom...

758
01:09:16,369 --> 01:09:18,278
she's here...

759
01:09:18,385 --> 01:09:20,239
in pieces.

760
01:09:22,289 --> 01:09:24,263
I fear it's hopeless.

761
01:09:29,968 --> 01:09:31,910
All right.

762
01:09:32,016 --> 01:09:34,121
We're taking your Clark Nova.

763
01:09:34,224 --> 01:09:35,915
Hafid, the bag.

764
01:09:36,016 --> 01:09:37,903
No.

765
01:09:38,927 --> 01:09:40,815
No.

766
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,549
Wh-Wh-What's going on here?

767
01:10:01,615 --> 01:10:04,266
Wait, wait, wait! This is
a heinous mistake you're making.

768
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:06,636
Lee, do something.
Stop them.

769
01:10:06,735 --> 01:10:10,445
Well, he's got a gun, Clark Nova.
You don't want to lose your best agent, do ya?

770
01:10:10,543 --> 01:10:14,155
You're gonna have to write
a full report, Lee. And I mean full.

771
01:10:14,255 --> 01:10:16,077
How am I gonna write it,
in longhand?

772
01:10:16,175 --> 01:10:18,182
Will you take this sack off!.

773
01:10:18,286 --> 01:10:20,174
This is insubordination.!

774
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:23,882
Ooh,you're all gonna pay for this.!
Heads are gonna roll.!

775
01:10:23,983 --> 01:10:27,016
Your days in Interzone are numbered, Lee.

776
01:10:28,014 --> 01:10:30,403
I suggest you give up
the writing game.

777
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:33,772
- Make tracks for another part of the world.
- You guys are gonna-

778
01:10:39,279 --> 01:10:42,344
Fuck 'em all.
Squares on both sides.

779
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:46,286
I am the only complete man in the industry.

780
01:11:13,869 --> 01:11:16,553
- Bill.
- Bill?

781
01:11:23,309 --> 01:11:26,953
I must be hallucinating.

782
01:11:27,053 --> 01:11:28,875
What are you cats doing here?

783
01:11:28,973 --> 01:11:30,947
We're here to see you, Bill.

784
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:32,875
Come on.

785
01:11:32,972 --> 01:11:36,966
Yeah, man. It's probably the first time
you haven't been hallucinating in a long time.

786
01:11:37,068 --> 01:11:38,923
What are you talking about?

787
01:11:38,988 --> 01:11:43,298
What are you saying?
Naturally, I've had a few odd moments.

788
01:11:43,404 --> 01:11:45,706
Everybody blacks out in Interzone.

789
01:11:45,964 --> 01:11:47,874
- Wouldn't you?
- Definitely.

790
01:11:47,949 --> 01:11:49,836
Sure.

791
01:11:52,685 --> 01:11:54,757
What's in the pillowcase, Bill?

792
01:11:54,829 --> 01:11:58,855
These are the remains
of my last writing machine.

793
01:11:58,956 --> 01:12:01,029
It's been a big problem for me.

794
01:12:01,292 --> 01:12:03,627
- Mind if I take a look?
- Go ahead.

795
01:12:09,228 --> 01:12:11,399
Wait a minute.
Where are we going?

796
01:12:12,939 --> 01:12:14,761
Oh, man.

797
01:12:14,859 --> 01:12:17,248
- How about back to your place?
- Nope.

798
01:12:17,356 --> 01:12:19,210
Why not?

799
01:12:20,555 --> 01:12:22,758
I'm not safe there.
I'm a dead duck there.

800
01:12:24,459 --> 01:12:26,402
We'll protect you.

801
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:29,355
You boys are kidding yourselves.

802
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:32,486
You're babes in the woods here.

803
01:12:32,587 --> 01:12:34,409
Well, what do you suggest?

804
01:12:34,507 --> 01:12:37,442
We thought it was important for us
to help you get your book together.

805
01:12:37,547 --> 01:12:40,297
Yeah, I've sent sections of it
to my publisher, and they're interested.

806
01:12:40,395 --> 01:12:44,007
- All you gotta do is finish it, man.
- You've already done the hard part.

807
01:12:46,443 --> 01:12:48,352
Book. My book?

808
01:12:48,459 --> 01:12:50,727
Yeah. The one
you've been calling Naked Lunch.

809
01:12:56,363 --> 01:12:59,013
Where did you put
that Bradley the Buyer routine?

810
01:12:59,082 --> 01:13:00,937
Did you find it all?

811
01:13:01,034 --> 01:13:04,646
Yeah. It's on the sofa
right next to the Hassan's Rumpus Room riff.

812
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:06,918
- It's all right there.
- I'm telling you, boys...

813
01:13:06,986 --> 01:13:08,841
I never saw those pages before.

814
01:13:10,026 --> 01:13:13,288
I truly do suspect
some sort of colossal con.

815
01:13:13,387 --> 01:13:16,201
Oh, someone's planted
these pages in your room, right?

816
01:13:16,298 --> 01:13:20,226
Somebody sent all those letters to me
and signed them with your name, right?

817
01:13:21,674 --> 01:13:24,063
A well-orchestrated cabal
could easily manage...

818
01:13:24,169 --> 01:13:26,341
all of these simple things, children.

819
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:28,581
When will you learn?

820
01:13:28,681 --> 01:13:32,423
They've done you a favor, 'cause this stuff!s
gonna get published under your name...

821
01:13:32,521 --> 01:13:34,343
and you'll have a career.

822
01:13:34,441 --> 01:13:37,856
Yeah, you'll probably
get into print before we will.

823
01:13:37,961 --> 01:13:40,775
For God's sake, Bill,
play ball with this conspiracy.

824
01:13:42,121 --> 01:13:44,009
You're patronizing me, boys...

825
01:13:46,026 --> 01:13:48,840
but I don't mind,
'cause you're so sweet to me, too.

826
01:13:48,906 --> 01:13:51,655
Hey, Martin, listen to this.

827
01:13:52,713 --> 01:13:57,982
"So we start for New Orleans past
iridescent lakes and orange gas flares...

828
01:13:58,089 --> 01:13:59,911
"and swamps and garbage heaps...

829
01:14:00,009 --> 01:14:04,165
"alligators crawling around
in broken bottles and tin cans...

830
01:14:05,417 --> 01:14:07,456
"neon arabesques of motels...

831
01:14:07,561 --> 01:14:12,776
"marooned pimps scream obscenities
at passing cars from islands of rubbish.

832
01:14:14,344 --> 01:14:17,093
New Orleans is a dead museum."

833
01:14:18,184 --> 01:14:20,322
So nice.

834
01:14:20,392 --> 01:14:22,248
Sound familiar, Bill?

835
01:14:24,904 --> 01:14:26,846
First time I ever heard it. Read on.

836
01:14:46,887 --> 01:14:50,597
I think it's time to discuss your, uh...

837
01:14:50,695 --> 01:14:54,437
philosophy of drug use
as it relates to artistic endeavor.

838
01:14:55,975 --> 01:14:58,244
I think it's time
to bring this meeting to order.

839
01:14:59,976 --> 01:15:04,416
I think it's time for you boys
to share my last taste...

840
01:15:04,519 --> 01:15:06,461
of the true black meat.

841
01:15:08,967 --> 01:15:13,222
The flesh of the giant
aquatic Brazilian centipede.

842
01:15:16,615 --> 01:15:20,063
So we're still here
in Interzone with Bill, right?

843
01:15:20,134 --> 01:15:21,989
That's right, Hank.

844
01:15:22,087 --> 01:15:24,389
And now we're gonna travel
back to the city, right?

845
01:15:24,647 --> 01:15:28,127
- That's right, Hank.
- I think Bill's on top of things here, don't you?

846
01:15:28,199 --> 01:15:33,501
He has a grip on a certain, uh,
unique reality principle, yes.

847
01:15:33,606 --> 01:15:36,192
I think you both should consider
staying here for a few months.

848
01:15:36,293 --> 01:15:39,491
Everything you could want
is cheap and-and plentiful here.

849
01:15:39,559 --> 01:15:42,908
That reality principle thing
could work for you, too.

850
01:15:44,167 --> 01:15:47,396
Well, my mother's all alone,
and she's kind of sick, Bill.

851
01:15:47,655 --> 01:15:49,924
And besides, my book's
as all-American as football.

852
01:15:50,918 --> 01:15:54,715
- Couldn't finish it here.
- America is not a young land.

853
01:15:56,453 --> 01:15:58,308
It is old...

854
01:15:58,373 --> 01:16:00,380
and dirty and evil.

855
01:16:01,446 --> 01:16:03,934
Before the settlers,
before the Indians.

856
01:16:06,501 --> 01:16:09,370
The evil is there waiting.

857
01:16:15,878 --> 01:16:17,732
What about you, Martin?

858
01:16:19,878 --> 01:16:24,068
Maybe you can, uh, move into my place.

859
01:16:24,165 --> 01:16:25,987
What do you think?

860
01:16:29,349 --> 01:16:31,869
Stay until you finish the book...

861
01:16:31,972 --> 01:16:33,860
but then come back to us.

862
01:16:50,724 --> 01:16:52,546
You'll be okay?

863
01:16:55,524 --> 01:16:57,346
Yeah. Don't worry about me.

864
01:16:57,444 --> 01:17:00,793
The Zone is full of surprises.

865
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:05,027
The Zone takes care of its own.

866
01:17:42,755 --> 01:17:45,569
William?

867
01:17:49,571 --> 01:17:51,710
You look terrible.

868
01:17:51,810 --> 01:17:53,665
What are you doing here?

869
01:17:55,202 --> 01:17:57,090
I don't - I don't know.

870
01:17:59,011 --> 01:18:01,312
I just -

871
01:18:02,914 --> 01:18:05,369
My only fr-

872
01:18:05,474 --> 01:18:08,157
My only friends in the -
in the world.

873
01:18:09,666 --> 01:18:13,889
I- I'm afraid I-
I'll never see 'em again.

874
01:18:16,834 --> 01:18:19,584
I feel - feel so -

875
01:18:21,346 --> 01:18:23,518
Oh. Severed.

876
01:18:25,922 --> 01:18:27,962
Come with me.

877
01:18:28,066 --> 01:18:31,295
- Take me home.
- I can't go home.

878
01:18:31,394 --> 01:18:33,303
I can't go home.

879
01:18:38,497 --> 01:18:40,384
Is that your typing machine there?

880
01:18:42,305 --> 01:18:47,094
Foutu.
Broken... beyond repair.

881
01:18:48,544 --> 01:18:51,262
If we fix the typing machine...

882
01:18:51,362 --> 01:18:53,817
we also fix the life.

883
01:19:12,384 --> 01:19:14,239
There. You see?

884
01:19:14,336 --> 01:19:16,824
There's no cause for despair.

885
01:19:16,929 --> 01:19:19,711
In this shop,
anything can be fixed that is broken.

886
01:19:51,391 --> 01:19:53,278
I don't know, Kiki.

887
01:19:55,103 --> 01:19:58,202
They don't seem to be capable
of delicate work here.

888
01:19:58,303 --> 01:20:01,150
You must have faith, William.

889
01:20:02,206 --> 01:20:04,061
Look.

890
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:06,015
We have your new writing machine.

891
01:20:40,478 --> 01:20:43,325
Not bad. Not bad.
Not bad. Not bad.

892
01:20:43,389 --> 01:20:46,008
I feel very comfortable
working with you.

893
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:49,907
I like that sense of camaraderie in an agent.

894
01:20:50,014 --> 01:20:52,316
You must be progressing.

895
01:20:52,414 --> 01:20:56,156
My predecessor felt you had
an ambivalent relationship with him.

896
01:20:58,654 --> 01:21:00,541
- You mean Clark Nova.
- Yes.

897
01:21:01,533 --> 01:21:03,508
How is he?

898
01:21:03,582 --> 01:21:06,331
He's still in the hands of our enemies.

899
01:21:06,429 --> 01:21:08,665
Such are the hazards of our trade.

900
01:21:08,893 --> 01:21:10,802
A hazardous trade, yes.

901
01:21:12,413 --> 01:21:15,315
Your report on the subversive
activities ofJoan Frost...

902
01:21:15,421 --> 01:21:17,722
was a model of its type.

903
01:21:17,821 --> 01:21:20,985
If you continue to develop
your skills as an operative...

904
01:21:21,084 --> 01:21:25,176
I think a top position
with the C.I.A. is not out of reach.

905
01:21:26,557 --> 01:21:29,012
The C.I.A.?
You really think so?

906
01:21:29,117 --> 01:21:32,597
You have the demeanor.
That's something you can't buy.

907
01:21:34,397 --> 01:21:36,219
The C.I.A.

908
01:21:38,652 --> 01:21:40,888
The C.I.A.

909
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:46,678
Now, that's a career
you can really sink your teeth into.

910
01:21:46,781 --> 01:21:48,635
It has...

911
01:21:50,204 --> 01:21:52,091
resonance.

912
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:55,958
But giving yourself over
to being a writer-

913
01:21:57,948 --> 01:22:00,184
Ah, well.

914
01:22:01,244 --> 01:22:04,146
This stuff is very potent.

915
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:06,162
The two are very closely related.

916
01:22:06,428 --> 01:22:08,730
So you boys keep telling me.

917
01:22:09,916 --> 01:22:13,713
Well, what's my next assignment?

918
01:22:13,819 --> 01:22:16,208
I'm hungry for adventure.

919
01:22:16,316 --> 01:22:21,072
Excellent.
You know the Swiss dandy Cloquet?

920
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:23,002
- Yes.
- And?

921
01:22:25,339 --> 01:22:28,687
I think he's a faggito and won't admit it.

922
01:22:28,795 --> 01:22:31,380
That ought to make it all easier.

923
01:22:31,450 --> 01:22:34,516
You will seduce
or otherwise compromise Cloquet.

924
01:22:34,619 --> 01:22:40,184
We have it on good authority
that he's our conduit to Benway.

925
01:22:40,284 --> 01:22:42,291
Dr. Benway, M.D., Ph.D.?

926
01:22:42,364 --> 01:22:46,836
Self-styled. He never actually
made it through medical school.

927
01:22:46,939 --> 01:22:50,867
He runs an interesting little show here
which he calls Interzone, Inc.

928
01:22:50,971 --> 01:22:52,793
Pretentious, if you ask me.

929
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:54,995
Benway's behind Interzone, Inc.?

930
01:22:55,066 --> 01:22:58,415
The base of his pyramid
is a drug called the black meat.

931
01:22:58,490 --> 01:23:00,399
- The pyramid's tip -
- Is?

932
01:23:00,506 --> 01:23:02,677
Ah. Well, we'd like to know.

933
01:23:06,554 --> 01:23:08,441
Dr. Benway.

934
01:23:10,682 --> 01:23:12,918
- Of course.
- Yes.

935
01:23:13,018 --> 01:23:16,629
- Yes.
- And he's obviously got sensational cover.

936
01:23:16,729 --> 01:23:19,796
He's floated in and out
of the Zone for years...

937
01:23:19,899 --> 01:23:21,938
without anybody actually
ever seeing him.

938
01:23:22,202 --> 01:23:25,169
But now the pressure's on
to place an agent close to him.

939
01:23:25,274 --> 01:23:27,510
Me.

940
01:23:28,730 --> 01:23:30,835
Assessments are being made.

941
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:51,149
- You're working away, William?
- Yes, Kiki.

942
01:23:53,048 --> 01:23:57,140
The machine turns out
to be a very good one.

943
01:23:57,242 --> 01:23:59,347
Muy simpatico.

944
01:24:00,953 --> 01:24:03,538
And I have you to thank for it...

945
01:24:04,793 --> 01:24:06,680
and so I will.

946
01:24:06,777 --> 01:24:08,686
Thank you.

947
01:24:10,265 --> 01:24:12,982
I'm very proud
to be your friend, you know.

948
01:24:14,648 --> 01:24:17,518
I'm very proud
that I can help you to be a writer.

949
01:24:19,321 --> 01:24:22,288
You have done that, Kiki.
You really have.

950
01:24:32,887 --> 01:24:35,277
Would you like some tea?

951
01:24:35,352 --> 01:24:37,239
That would be lovely, William.

952
01:24:42,519 --> 01:24:44,374
Kiki.

953
01:24:44,472 --> 01:24:48,116
- Hmm?
- Do you know Cloquet?

954
01:24:49,176 --> 01:24:52,525
The Swiss man with the big house
on the Old Valley Road?

955
01:24:52,631 --> 01:24:54,453
Cloquet?

956
01:24:55,895 --> 01:24:59,376
Oh,yes,yes.
Yves with the wonderful car.

957
01:25:01,015 --> 01:25:02,869
He has a wonderful car?

958
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:06,674
The most wonderful car.

959
01:25:14,807 --> 01:25:16,781
Enjoying the ride?

960
01:25:16,887 --> 01:25:19,538
I'm wild about it, yes.
Thank you.

961
01:25:19,639 --> 01:25:21,526
It's good to be wild sometimes.

962
01:25:23,991 --> 01:25:27,057
You know, I have often thought of
that funny story you told me...

963
01:25:27,159 --> 01:25:28,981
the first time we met on the beach.

964
01:25:29,078 --> 01:25:32,242
The one about the Duc de Ventre.

965
01:25:32,342 --> 01:25:36,466
At first I didn't know how to take it.

966
01:25:36,534 --> 01:25:39,403
I thought you were
making a pass at me.

967
01:25:42,293 --> 01:25:45,642
Did I ever tell you about the man
who taught his asshole to talk?

968
01:25:46,805 --> 01:25:50,929
His whole abdomen would move up and down,
you dig, farting out the words.

969
01:25:52,342 --> 01:25:54,229
It was unlike anything I ever heard.

970
01:25:54,326 --> 01:25:57,173
Bubbly, thick, stagnant sound.

971
01:25:57,270 --> 01:25:59,659
A sound you could smell.

972
01:25:59,765 --> 01:26:01,740
This man worked for the carnival,you dig?

973
01:26:01,845 --> 01:26:04,715
And to start with it was
like a novelty ventriloquist act.

974
01:26:04,821 --> 01:26:07,155
After a while,
the ass started talking on its own.

975
01:26:07,253 --> 01:26:09,489
He would go in
without anything prepared...

976
01:26:09,589 --> 01:26:13,386
and his ass would ad-lib
and toss the gags back at him every time.

977
01:26:15,029 --> 01:26:16,883
Then it developed sort of teethlike...

978
01:26:16,981 --> 01:26:21,039
little raspy incurving hooks
and started eating.

979
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:23,857
He thought this was cute at first
and built an act around it...

980
01:26:23,924 --> 01:26:27,240
but the asshole would eat its way through
his pants and start talking on the street...

981
01:26:27,349 --> 01:26:29,684
shouting out it wanted equal rights.

982
01:26:29,781 --> 01:26:34,058
It would get drunk, too, and have crying jags.
Nobody loved it.

983
01:26:34,165 --> 01:26:37,548
And it wanted to be kissed,
same as any other mouth.

984
01:26:37,653 --> 01:26:39,792
Finally, it talked all the time,
day and night.

985
01:26:39,892 --> 01:26:44,016
You could hear him for blocks,
screaming at it to shut up...

986
01:26:44,117 --> 01:26:46,004
beating at it with his fists...

987
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:48,042
and sticking candles up it, but...

988
01:26:49,396 --> 01:26:51,632
nothing did any good,
and the asshole said to him...

989
01:26:51,732 --> 01:26:54,449
"It is you who will shut up
in the end, not me...

990
01:26:54,548 --> 01:26:57,581
"because we don't need you
around here anymore.

991
01:26:57,684 --> 01:27:00,302
I can talk and eat and shit."

992
01:27:01,811 --> 01:27:05,640
After that, he began waking up
in the morning with transparentjelly...

993
01:27:05,748 --> 01:27:08,204
like a tadpole's tail
all over his mouth.

994
01:27:09,716 --> 01:27:13,065
He would tear it off his mouth
and the pieces would stick to his hands...

995
01:27:13,331 --> 01:27:17,706
like burning gasoline jelly
and grow there.

996
01:27:17,812 --> 01:27:21,008
So, finally, his mouth sealed over...

997
01:27:21,108 --> 01:27:22,963
and the whole head...

998
01:27:23,028 --> 01:27:26,224
would have amputated spontaneously
except for the eyes, you dig?

999
01:27:26,323 --> 01:27:29,170
That's the one thing
that the asshole couldn't do was see.

1000
01:27:29,267 --> 01:27:31,820
It needed the eyes.

1001
01:27:31,922 --> 01:27:33,864
Nerve connections were blocked...

1002
01:27:33,971 --> 01:27:35,945
and infiltrated and atrophied.

1003
01:27:36,051 --> 01:27:39,400
So, the brain couldn't
give orders anymore.

1004
01:27:39,506 --> 01:27:42,539
It was trapped inside the skull...

1005
01:27:42,610 --> 01:27:44,520
sealed off.

1006
01:27:46,387 --> 01:27:48,394
For a while, you could see...

1007
01:27:48,499 --> 01:27:53,233
the silent, helpless suffering
of the brain behind the eyes.

1008
01:27:55,763 --> 01:27:57,835
And then finally
the brain must have died...

1009
01:27:57,939 --> 01:27:59,761
because the eyes went out...

1010
01:28:00,850 --> 01:28:05,258
and there was no more feeling in them
than a crab's eye at the end of a stalk.

1011
01:28:18,034 --> 01:28:21,382
You seem to like my little friend.
I'm so glad.

1012
01:28:21,457 --> 01:28:25,233
I'm writing a business piece
on corporate life in North Africa.

1013
01:28:29,681 --> 01:28:31,536
Oh, my, my.

1014
01:28:31,601 --> 01:28:34,503
We are fragile today, aren't we?

1015
01:28:35,826 --> 01:28:37,768
He has to get to know you first.

1016
01:28:37,873 --> 01:28:41,168
Oh, does he?
Well, let's see what we can do, then.

1017
01:28:44,113 --> 01:28:46,350
Kiki, will you come
and see the parrots with me?

1018
01:28:46,448 --> 01:28:48,423
There are cages in the master bedroom.

1019
01:28:48,529 --> 01:28:51,660
I, um, don't think I can, Mr. Cloquet.

1020
01:28:51,729 --> 01:28:54,314
That is, I don't really want to.

1021
01:28:54,417 --> 01:28:58,246
I'd particularly like to interview
a certain Dr. Benway.

1022
01:29:00,432 --> 01:29:05,135
Kiki doesn't seem to find my parrots
attractive anymore. Isn't that sad?

1023
01:29:05,201 --> 01:29:08,168
Kiki would love to play
with your parrots, Yves...

1024
01:29:08,432 --> 01:29:13,353
but Kiki is as anxious to contact
this Benway character as I am.

1025
01:29:14,768 --> 01:29:18,117
Fadela, the witch
who works for the Frosts...

1026
01:29:18,192 --> 01:29:20,079
she and Benway are...

1027
01:29:20,176 --> 01:29:22,031
intimates.

1028
01:29:22,096 --> 01:29:24,332
You didn't hear it from me.

1029
01:29:24,432 --> 01:29:26,571
Kiki?

1030
01:29:29,295 --> 01:29:33,386
Go see the fucking parrots, will you, Kiki?
I gotta take a piss.

1031
01:29:35,759 --> 01:29:38,246
Then I'll come and get you,
and we'll go home.

1032
01:29:38,351 --> 01:29:40,456
Pissoir's at the end of the great hall.

1033
01:30:11,150 --> 01:30:13,092
Kiki.

1034
01:30:18,126 --> 01:30:20,014
Kiki.

1035
01:30:29,422 --> 01:30:31,429
Kiki.

1036
01:31:10,797 --> 01:31:13,447
Hello, Bill. What's up?

1037
01:31:15,757 --> 01:31:17,579
Something the matter?

1038
01:31:18,573 --> 01:31:20,875
You seem distracted.

1039
01:31:25,901 --> 01:31:28,748
I wish you'd say something.

1040
01:31:28,844 --> 01:31:31,080
I don't like this mood, Bill.

1041
01:31:31,340 --> 01:31:33,544
- Are we going out?
- You're going out.

1042
01:31:33,612 --> 01:31:37,225
Why don't you just write something
and calm yourself down?

1043
01:31:37,293 --> 01:31:40,456
You're obviously not
in a professional state of mind.

1044
01:31:40,525 --> 01:31:43,753
Maybe I should write about
your little double cross.

1045
01:31:43,852 --> 01:31:48,129
You expected me to end up
in that parrot cage with Cloquet, didn't you?

1046
01:31:48,236 --> 01:31:52,010
Bill, are you thinking
of getting rid of me?

1047
01:31:52,076 --> 01:31:57,193
I think an exchange of hostages
is the only viable scenario.

1048
01:31:57,292 --> 01:31:59,680
No, really, Bill, if you get rid of me...

1049
01:31:59,788 --> 01:32:01,730
you sever ties with reality.

1050
01:32:01,995 --> 01:32:04,134
For instance, take the case of-

1051
01:32:04,236 --> 01:32:06,123
Oh.! Careful.!

1052
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:10,016
Of the female agent who forgot
her real identity and merged with her cover story.

1053
01:32:10,123 --> 01:32:13,668
She is still a fricoteuse in Annexia.

1054
01:32:13,771 --> 01:32:16,936
And incidentally,you can make a square,
heterosex citizen queer...

1055
01:32:17,035 --> 01:32:19,653
with this angle using drugs-

1056
01:32:21,291 --> 01:32:23,179
Tom...

1057
01:32:23,275 --> 01:32:25,163
I've brought you a new typewriter...

1058
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:28,161
which conveniently dispenses
two types of intoxicating fluids...

1059
01:32:28,235 --> 01:32:30,374
when it likes what you've written.

1060
01:32:32,331 --> 01:32:34,720
Are you proposing to trade back
for your Clark Nova?

1061
01:32:36,171 --> 01:32:37,993
Thinking of it.

1062
01:32:38,091 --> 01:32:39,946
Has it written
anything good for you lately?

1063
01:32:41,706 --> 01:32:45,732
No. It's too damned
all-American for my taste.

1064
01:32:45,834 --> 01:32:48,452
Guess I've gone foreign or something.

1065
01:32:49,962 --> 01:32:53,411
Well, my Mugwriter here
is so foreign, it's almost alien.

1066
01:32:53,514 --> 01:32:56,994
You're gonna do
your best work on her. Guaranteed.

1067
01:33:04,586 --> 01:33:09,092
Hafid, bring the machine
in question for Bill, will you?

1068
01:33:22,666 --> 01:33:24,902
And how are you enjoying
your affair with Joan?

1069
01:33:25,001 --> 01:33:28,514
Literate, complex and neurotic,
I would imagine.

1070
01:33:32,810 --> 01:33:34,719
I haven't seen her for weeks.

1071
01:33:36,009 --> 01:33:38,082
She ran off with Fadela and her coven.

1072
01:33:38,185 --> 01:33:40,072
Oh, that's too bad.

1073
01:33:42,281 --> 01:33:45,096
Yes, she does that
when she feels attracted to a man.

1074
01:33:47,113 --> 01:33:49,961
Don't give up though.
It's-It's a good sign.

1075
01:33:50,056 --> 01:33:51,998
With Joanie...

1076
01:33:52,265 --> 01:33:56,356
the courtship period can involve
years of passionate ambivalence.

1077
01:34:01,992 --> 01:34:05,854
Tom, I think we should
take a close look at his machine first...

1078
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:07,848
test it thoroughly.

1079
01:34:07,944 --> 01:34:11,173
Don't you, Tom?

1080
01:34:11,272 --> 01:34:15,233
You both have different writing styles.

1081
01:34:15,336 --> 01:34:18,849
Bill Lee has always been a man
of powerful instinct, Hafid.

1082
01:34:20,328 --> 01:34:22,532
If he says I'll do
my best work on his machine...

1083
01:34:22,632 --> 01:34:24,487
well, I'm sure that's prophecy.

1084
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:32,229
Take the gun, too, Bill.

1085
01:34:32,328 --> 01:34:37,030
No American should find himself
in a foreign land without a pistol.

1086
01:34:39,271 --> 01:34:42,140
You wouldn't be trying to set me up again,
now, would you, Tom?

1087
01:34:42,247 --> 01:34:45,956
Well, you've set yourself up already, Bill.

1088
01:34:46,023 --> 01:34:49,024
I'm just trying to give you
a fighting chance. That's all.

1089
01:35:07,558 --> 01:35:09,380
Clark Nova.

1090
01:35:09,478 --> 01:35:11,365
Clark Nova, it's me.

1091
01:35:12,422 --> 01:35:14,277
It's - It's Bill Lee.

1092
01:35:14,342 --> 01:35:18,597
Clark Nova, speak to me.
You're safe with me now.

1093
01:35:18,662 --> 01:35:20,550
They tortured me...

1094
01:35:20,614 --> 01:35:24,029
did unspeakable things to me.

1095
01:35:24,102 --> 01:35:27,266
I'm on my last legs.
The bastards.

1096
01:35:28,678 --> 01:35:31,525
Clark Nova, where is Joan?
Where's Joan?

1097
01:35:33,286 --> 01:35:35,969
Hans's old drug factory in the medina.

1098
01:35:37,286 --> 01:35:39,108
Fadela is there.

1099
01:35:39,206 --> 01:35:43,516
Fadela is your point of penetration
into Interzone, Inc.

1100
01:35:45,094 --> 01:35:47,036
Fadela.

1101
01:35:47,142 --> 01:35:49,727
Uh, what do I -
what do I do when I find her?

1102
01:35:49,797 --> 01:35:53,659
You'll know what to do
when the time comes.

1103
01:35:53,765 --> 01:35:56,034
Just remember this -

1104
01:35:56,101 --> 01:35:58,468
all agents defect...

1105
01:35:58,565 --> 01:36:01,118
and all resisters sell out.

1106
01:36:02,469 --> 01:36:04,772
That's the sad truth, Bill.

1107
01:36:04,869 --> 01:36:09,987
And a writer-
a writer lives the sad truth like anyone else.

1108
01:36:10,085 --> 01:36:12,736
The only difference is -

1109
01:36:12,805 --> 01:36:14,692
he files a report on it.

1110
01:36:14,789 --> 01:36:17,691
Leave me now...

1111
01:36:17,797 --> 01:36:19,651
before it's too late.

1112
01:36:19,717 --> 01:36:21,888
But wait. What aboutJoan?
What aboutJoan?

1113
01:36:21,988 --> 01:36:26,396
Go now!
Vaya con dios.

1114
01:36:26,661 --> 01:36:29,922
Clark Nova. Clark Nova -

1115
01:37:45,602 --> 01:37:47,489
Hurry. Hurry.

1116
01:37:49,698 --> 01:37:51,552
Come on.

1117
01:38:00,354 --> 01:38:05,624
Your notes must be much more
carefully detailed to be of any use to us.

1118
01:38:05,730 --> 01:38:08,316
You must write very clearly.

1119
01:38:08,418 --> 01:38:11,647
The effects of the drugs
must be cataloged...

1120
01:38:11,746 --> 01:38:14,201
with painstaking accuracy.

1121
01:38:32,833 --> 01:38:34,808
-Joan.
- Hmm?

1122
01:38:34,912 --> 01:38:37,301
-Joan.
- Bill.

1123
01:38:39,298 --> 01:38:41,152
Oh, Bill.

1124
01:38:45,345 --> 01:38:47,385
No.

1125
01:38:47,649 --> 01:38:50,136
No.

1126
01:38:50,241 --> 01:38:53,023
What is that?
What are you writing?

1127
01:38:53,121 --> 01:38:55,903
I'm writing...

1128
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,783
"All is lost.

1129
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:00,702
All is lost."

1130
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:04,153
- It's all I've ever written.
- No.

1131
01:39:09,024 --> 01:39:10,911
No.

1132
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:12,831
Oh,Joan.

1133
01:39:13,823 --> 01:39:15,678
We have to see Fadela.

1134
01:39:16,704 --> 01:39:18,559
Take me to Fadela.

1135
01:39:38,495 --> 01:39:41,529
Lee, you're here.

1136
01:39:41,631 --> 01:39:43,638
Oh, thank God. Thank God.

1137
01:39:43,743 --> 01:39:47,801
You see, my misdemeanor
has borne sweet fruit.

1138
01:39:48,063 --> 01:39:49,972
Now you are with us.

1139
01:39:50,079 --> 01:39:53,941
I was right to approach you so brazenly.

1140
01:39:54,046 --> 01:39:57,625
And now Dr. Benway will have no choice -

1141
01:39:57,727 --> 01:40:00,858
- Benway.
- Benway.

1142
01:40:00,927 --> 01:40:02,814
No choice but to send me back-

1143
01:40:02,911 --> 01:40:05,758
- You'll see.
- Benway.

1144
01:40:05,855 --> 01:40:07,710
Where I belong.

1145
01:40:17,246 --> 01:40:19,319
Well, well.

1146
01:40:19,422 --> 01:40:22,269
If it isn't William Lee.

1147
01:40:28,990 --> 01:40:31,226
I got to say I'm proud of you, sir.

1148
01:40:31,325 --> 01:40:33,693
It took you a while,
but you got us red-handed.

1149
01:40:33,791 --> 01:40:35,613
Full marks, boy.
Full marks.

1150
01:40:38,974 --> 01:40:42,323
I expected to see an operation
all out for the black meat here.

1151
01:40:42,430 --> 01:40:44,819
What's with all the Mugwump jism?

1152
01:40:46,845 --> 01:40:48,787
The black meat concession
turns out to have...

1153
01:40:48,894 --> 01:40:52,374
some unfortunate
political strings attached.

1154
01:40:52,478 --> 01:40:54,300
We'vejust cut those strings.

1155
01:40:54,398 --> 01:40:59,099
From now on,
Interzone is strictly Mugwump territory.

1156
01:40:59,197 --> 01:41:03,540
As you can see, we've made
a flying start here with our modest dispensary.

1157
01:41:04,605 --> 01:41:06,994
I can feel the heat
closing in on you, Fadela.

1158
01:41:08,637 --> 01:41:11,092
Feel them out there
making their moves,you dig?

1159
01:41:11,196 --> 01:41:13,619
Oh, really?

1160
01:41:13,693 --> 01:41:15,766
Fadela. Huh.

1161
01:41:15,869 --> 01:41:19,382
Huh.

1162
01:41:19,485 --> 01:41:21,372
You mean this old thing.

1163
01:41:33,276 --> 01:41:35,578
- Benway!
- Benway!

1164
01:41:35,676 --> 01:41:37,684
Benway.!

1165
01:41:37,788 --> 01:41:39,795
We met once before, remember? Stateside.

1166
01:41:43,132 --> 01:41:45,979
You don't remember.
You had that look, boy.

1167
01:41:47,483 --> 01:41:50,518
The look of a...
sheep-killing dog.

1168
01:41:51,516 --> 01:41:54,004
Decided to recruit you
right on the spot.

1169
01:41:54,108 --> 01:41:56,726
I'm afraid I was forced
by the tenor of the times...

1170
01:41:56,828 --> 01:41:59,577
to prescribe that wretched
black meat powder to start you off on...

1171
01:41:59,643 --> 01:42:03,767
but the hole-in-the-wall operation,
limited resources -

1172
01:42:03,835 --> 01:42:05,690
you understand the problems.

1173
01:42:06,844 --> 01:42:11,121
But I understand from Cloquet
that, uh, you're on to our good stuff now.

1174
01:42:12,475 --> 01:42:14,864
Mugwump jism can't be beat.

1175
01:42:14,971 --> 01:42:19,575
And as you can see,
we've got ourselves a few more friends now.

1176
01:42:21,147 --> 01:42:23,635
And a few more dollars, too.

1177
01:42:24,858 --> 01:42:26,713
Oh.

1178
01:42:26,811 --> 01:42:30,160
This little, uh, Fadela number
is something I developed...

1179
01:42:30,267 --> 01:42:34,009
during my tenure as chief physician
to the prime minister of Annexia.

1180
01:42:34,107 --> 01:42:38,449
"El Primo" liked to walk the streets
amongst his people in drag, and, well -

1181
01:42:38,555 --> 01:42:41,205
Well...

1182
01:42:41,307 --> 01:42:43,674
one thing led to another.

1183
01:42:47,194 --> 01:42:50,991
It is an elegant way to strike terror
into the hearts of the enemy...

1184
01:42:51,258 --> 01:42:53,113
wouldn't you say?

1185
01:42:53,210 --> 01:42:55,599
Old Fadela must be on the rag.

1186
01:42:57,210 --> 01:42:59,217
She's been acting subversive lately.

1187
01:43:02,041 --> 01:43:04,430
Speaking of new uses
for old technology...

1188
01:43:05,658 --> 01:43:09,488
I think the new order could find
a place for a man of your caliber.

1189
01:43:09,594 --> 01:43:11,481
A .3 2, wasn't it?

1190
01:43:12,794 --> 01:43:14,998
That is what you're here for, isn't it?

1191
01:43:15,258 --> 01:43:17,298
Hell...

1192
01:43:17,401 --> 01:43:19,474
I could use a reliable man
to send to Annexia.

1193
01:43:19,577 --> 01:43:23,057
We're expanding, boy.
I need a... spearhead.

1194
01:43:24,857 --> 01:43:26,745
Just tell me what you want.

1195
01:43:28,665 --> 01:43:30,323
I want her.

1196
01:43:33,433 --> 01:43:35,505
Her?

1197
01:43:37,689 --> 01:43:39,794
That purulent little cunt?
What for?

1198
01:43:41,624 --> 01:43:43,479
I can't write without her.

1199
01:43:48,089 --> 01:43:51,155
Bill, I feel confident...

1200
01:43:51,257 --> 01:43:53,777
that you and I can
work something out.

1201
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:27,542
Papers, please.

1202
01:44:27,640 --> 01:44:29,462
What is the purpose of your visit...

1203
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:31,414
and what is your profession?

1204
01:44:31,512 --> 01:44:33,454
I write reports. I'm a writer...

1205
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:37,651
and I intend to write reports on life
in Annexia for the citizens of the U.S.A.

1206
01:44:37,751 --> 01:44:39,726
Do you have any proof of what you say?

1207
01:44:39,831 --> 01:44:41,904
How do we know
you are really a writer?

1208
01:44:43,767 --> 01:44:45,654
Well, I have a writing device.

1209
01:44:45,719 --> 01:44:47,409
That's not good enough.

1210
01:44:48,503 --> 01:44:50,390
Show us.

1211
01:44:51,382 --> 01:44:53,357
- Show you.
- Write something.

1212
01:44:58,839 --> 01:45:00,726
- Write something.
- Yes.

1213
01:45:01,815 --> 01:45:03,703
Write something.

1214
01:45:18,454 --> 01:45:21,007
Joan.

1215
01:45:21,110 --> 01:45:22,998
Joan.

1216
01:45:26,806 --> 01:45:30,002
What is it, Bill?
Are we there yet?

1217
01:45:31,541 --> 01:45:33,451
Almost,Joan.

1218
01:45:35,797 --> 01:45:38,797
But I guess it's about time
for our William Tell routine.

1219
01:45:40,406 --> 01:45:42,293
Sure, Bill.

1220
01:46:33,173 --> 01:46:36,075
Welcome... to Annexia.

1221
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:39,987
Yes. Welcome to Annexia.
