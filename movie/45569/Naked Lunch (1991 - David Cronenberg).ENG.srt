1
00:02:37,588 --> 00:02:39,474
Exterminator.

2
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:16,559
Mm-hmm.

3
00:03:16,658 --> 00:03:18,956
You want I should spit right in your face?

4
00:03:19,055 --> 00:03:21,442
You want, hmm?
You want? You want?

5
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:23,369
I ran out.

6
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:26,247
You ran out?
Oh, that's nice.

7
00:03:26,344 --> 00:03:29,123
You ran out.
It's impossible you run out.!

8
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:31,163
What'd you do, eat the stuff?.

9
00:03:31,268 --> 00:03:33,088
The Chink shortchanged me.

10
00:03:33,186 --> 00:03:35,355
No "glot." Come "Fliday."

11
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,013
It's funny.
It's actual very funny what you just said.

12
00:03:44,122 --> 00:03:45,974
Ran out.

13
00:03:46,071 --> 00:03:50,377
They can either paint it, or draw it, or write
it down and then pass it on to somebody.

14
00:03:50,451 --> 00:03:53,165
They read what you're saying,
and then they reexperience.

15
00:03:53,265 --> 00:03:55,238
That's the only connection
you have with that, man.

16
00:03:55,342 --> 00:03:57,381
So you can't rewrite...

17
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:00,101
'cause to rewrite is to deceive and lie...

18
00:04:00,203 --> 00:04:02,024
and you betray your own thoughts.

19
00:04:02,121 --> 00:04:06,209
To rethink the flow and the rhythm
and the tumbling out of the words...

20
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,127
is a betrayal.

21
00:04:08,387 --> 00:04:10,687
And it's a sin, Martin.
It's a sin.

22
00:04:10,787 --> 00:04:12,672
I don't accept your, uh...

23
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:15,416
Catholic interpretation
of my compulsive, uh...

24
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,402
necessity to rewrite
every single word at least 1 00 times.

25
00:04:20,505 --> 00:04:23,819
Guilt is -Thanks.
Guilt is the key, not sin.

26
00:04:23,926 --> 00:04:26,793
Guilt re not writing
the best that I can.

27
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,758
Guilt re not, uh, considering everything
from every possible angle.

28
00:04:30,864 --> 00:04:32,717
Balancing everything.

29
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:37,698
Well, how about guilt
re censoring your best thoughts?

30
00:04:37,802 --> 00:04:40,548
Your most honest,
primitive, real thoughts...

31
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:43,961
because that's what your laborious
rewriting amounts to, Martin.

32
00:04:44,964 --> 00:04:46,937
Is rewriting really censorship, Bill?

33
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:49,940
Because I'm completely fucked if it is.

34
00:04:50,048 --> 00:04:53,078
Exterminate all rational thought.

35
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:55,284
That is the conclusion I have come to.

36
00:04:55,387 --> 00:04:58,351
What is the man talking about?
I'm being serious.

37
00:04:58,455 --> 00:05:00,309
So is he.

38
00:05:03,476 --> 00:05:06,157
So how is the extermination business
going there, Bill?

39
00:05:06,225 --> 00:05:09,997
Somebody's stealing my roach powder.
Somebody's got it in for me.

40
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:12,841
Hmm. Well, Bill,
maybe you should take it as a sign.

41
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:15,173
Maybe you ought to try your hand
at writing pornography.

42
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:18,627
Yeah, a novel a week at 120 bucks.
It's serious money.

43
00:05:18,726 --> 00:05:20,580
I can connect you with the guy.

44
00:05:20,645 --> 00:05:23,489
We're thinking of
collaborating on one ourselves.

45
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:25,559
I gave up writing when I was 1 0.

46
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:30,076
- Too dangerous.
- Only if someone reads what you write.

47
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:32,440
So far we haven't had that problem.

48
00:05:32,698 --> 00:05:34,605
I've found my profession.
I'm an exterminator.

49
00:05:34,713 --> 00:05:38,058
Of course, Bill. That's just what the world needs-
more literate exterminators.

50
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:39,986
Give me a cigarette.

51
00:05:43,983 --> 00:05:46,535
Of course, then, you know...

52
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,635
you're gonna have trouble
if you can't keep track of your roach powder.

53
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,476
Wait a minute.
Do you boys know something about this?

54
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:02,463
We don't exactly know anything.

55
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:05,426
No, but we suspect
it's a domestic problem.

56
00:06:08,443 --> 00:06:11,604
-
-

57
00:06:38,592 --> 00:06:41,885
- My God, what are you doing?
- You weren't supposed to see this.

58
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:45,458
Well, now that I'm seeing it, what is it?

59
00:06:46,585 --> 00:06:48,438
I'm shooting up your bug powder.

60
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:51,850
You might like to try it yourself.

61
00:06:51,957 --> 00:06:53,777
Or you might not.

62
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:57,222
I ran out in the middle of a job.

63
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:02,213
You gotta stop using the stuff,Joan.

64
00:07:02,316 --> 00:07:04,735
They ration it out like snakebite serum.

65
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,814
Well,just do what everybody else does -

66
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:09,185
cut it with baby laxative.

67
00:07:09,445 --> 00:07:11,483
The roaches will
shit themselves to death.

68
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:14,905
It's the best job I ever had.

69
00:07:15,008 --> 00:07:17,146
If I run out again, I'm finished.

70
00:07:19,292 --> 00:07:21,200
Hmm.

71
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:24,498
It's, um -

72
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:29,714
It's a very literary high.

73
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:31,698
Very literary.

74
00:07:31,793 --> 00:07:33,832
Is that why Hank and Martin
know all about it?

75
00:07:33,935 --> 00:07:36,268
No, we just, uh -

76
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:39,145
We all just tried it together-
spur of the moment thing.

77
00:07:39,243 --> 00:07:41,249
They didn't like it, I did.

78
00:07:43,335 --> 00:07:45,439
What do you mean,
it's a literary high?

79
00:07:47,045 --> 00:07:48,898
It's a Kafka high.

80
00:07:48,963 --> 00:07:50,968
You feel like a bug.

81
00:07:53,342 --> 00:07:55,164
Try some.

82
00:07:58,522 --> 00:08:00,407
Well, I don't know.

83
00:08:03,094 --> 00:08:05,481
I don't know.

84
00:08:09,136 --> 00:08:12,843
- I think our metabolisms are very different.
- Whose?

85
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,795
Yours and Kafka's?

86
00:08:16,106 --> 00:08:18,886
I thought you were finished
with doing weird stuff.

87
00:08:20,423 --> 00:08:23,803
I thought I was, too,
but I guess I'm not.

88
00:08:29,087 --> 00:08:31,452
Personally...

89
00:08:31,548 --> 00:08:34,677
I prefer a pyrethrum job to a fluoride.

90
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:36,598
With the pyrethrum...

91
00:08:36,696 --> 00:08:39,280
you kill the roaches right there
in front of God and the client...

92
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,548
whereas this starch and fluoride-

93
00:08:41,652 --> 00:08:43,822
leave it around,
the roaches eat it...

94
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:46,821
come back a few days later,
they're running around fat as hogs.

95
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:52,042
And there it is, Bill.
You want to put on some weight...

96
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:55,780
you gotta switch
from that yellow powder diet of yours...

97
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:58,398
to some of this good
fluoride stuff right here.

98
00:08:59,428 --> 00:09:01,980
Sure works for the Chink.
He's healthy enough.

99
00:09:02,082 --> 00:09:03,968
You see him scarfthat poison down?

100
00:09:04,064 --> 00:09:07,509
He doesn't really eat it.

101
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,466
It's sleight of hand.

102
00:09:09,531 --> 00:09:13,391
The hell he doesn't. Been breathing in
the powder so long, it just makes him laugh.

103
00:09:13,497 --> 00:09:17,171
Just like them roaches.

104
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,474
William Lee.

105
00:09:34,247 --> 00:09:37,091
- What is this?
- He's Hauser. I'm O'Brien.

106
00:09:37,188 --> 00:09:39,488
City Narcotics.
We're gonna take you downtown, Bill.

107
00:09:39,586 --> 00:09:42,964
Little matter of possession
of a dangerous substance.

108
00:09:49,849 --> 00:09:52,084
You've got quite a record, Bill.

109
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,959
A lot of drugs poured down the old vein.

110
00:09:56,211 --> 00:09:58,381
I was a troubled person then.
I'm married now.

111
00:09:58,481 --> 00:10:00,302
Straight. Got a good job.

112
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,982
That's good, Bill.
That's nice.

113
00:10:04,908 --> 00:10:07,872
- What's this, then?
- That's my job.

114
00:10:07,945 --> 00:10:09,799
I use it to kill bugs.

115
00:10:09,864 --> 00:10:12,730
- He says it kills bugs.
- He could be right.

116
00:10:12,837 --> 00:10:15,071
- I'd like to see it.
- Me, too.

117
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:18,197
- I'd like to see it, too.
- Well, gee.

118
00:10:19,838 --> 00:10:23,577
I'd like to demonstrate, but I already
got rid of that last case of crabs I had.

119
00:10:24,985 --> 00:10:27,024
Very funny, Bill.

120
00:10:28,535 --> 00:10:30,922
But, you know...

121
00:10:31,028 --> 00:10:33,066
I think we got a bug
around here somewhere.

122
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,624
You're right.

123
00:10:35,728 --> 00:10:38,922
Let's see if that yellow stuff will kill it.

124
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,907
We'll be back later
to see how it worked out, kiddo.

125
00:11:36,123 --> 00:11:37,977
Yeah.

126
00:11:38,074 --> 00:11:39,959
Break a leg.

127
00:11:43,925 --> 00:11:47,020
William Lee?

128
00:11:47,122 --> 00:11:51,145
I have arranged all this
just to have a moment alone with you.

129
00:11:51,247 --> 00:11:53,514
I am your case officer.

130
00:11:54,796 --> 00:11:57,576
- Uh, my what?
- Case officer.

131
00:11:57,673 --> 00:11:59,809
You are my agent.

132
00:11:59,911 --> 00:12:03,007
I, in turn, report to your controller.

133
00:12:03,109 --> 00:12:07,676
Come, come, Mr. Lee.
You don't have to play dumb with me.

134
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:10,589
Oh. No. Well...

135
00:12:11,612 --> 00:12:13,499
that would be foolish, wouldn't it?

136
00:12:13,595 --> 00:12:16,082
It would. Say, Bill...

137
00:12:17,143 --> 00:12:21,296
do you think you could rub
some of this powder on my lips?

138
00:12:23,283 --> 00:12:25,136
Uh, yeah.

139
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:27,086
Sure.

140
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:38,847
Well, now.

141
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,112
As you might have expected...

142
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:46,778
I have instructions
for you from Control.

143
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,992
It's about the little woman.

144
00:12:53,976 --> 00:12:56,875
- The what?
- The little woman.

145
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,867
Your little woman.

146
00:12:58,931 --> 00:13:02,506
- Your wife.
- Tell me.

147
00:13:03,631 --> 00:13:06,529
Your wife is not really your wife.

148
00:13:06,637 --> 00:13:10,408
She is an agent of Interzone Incorporated.

149
00:13:10,504 --> 00:13:12,390
You must kill her.

150
00:13:12,647 --> 00:13:14,271
KillJoan Lee.

151
00:13:14,534 --> 00:13:17,825
It must be done soon-
this week.

152
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:21,596
And it must be done real tasty.

153
00:13:21,663 --> 00:13:23,701
Interzone Incorporated?

154
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:26,324
An organization based in Interzone...

155
00:13:26,427 --> 00:13:30,580
a notorious free port
on the North African coast.

156
00:13:30,838 --> 00:13:34,032
A haven for
the mongrel scum of the Earth...

157
00:13:34,132 --> 00:13:38,024
an engorged parasite
on the underbelly of the West.

158
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:40,679
Ah, I can't see it.

159
00:13:40,782 --> 00:13:42,984
Why would a classy
American woman likeJoan...

160
00:13:43,052 --> 00:13:47,423
ever want to work for a two-bit outfit
like Interzone Incorporated?

161
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:50,210
But who says Joan Lee is really a woman?

162
00:13:50,311 --> 00:13:54,300
In fact, who says she's human at all?

163
00:13:55,457 --> 00:13:59,545
- What do you mean by that?
- I can say no more.

164
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:06,383
Hey, where you going?

165
00:14:06,456 --> 00:14:08,593
Don't do it. Don't do it.
There'll be hell to pay.

166
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:11,861
We've been made.
We gotta get out of town.

167
00:15:11,966 --> 00:15:13,874
Wait a minute.

168
00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:18,573
- What's going on?
- I got busted for bug powder.

169
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,646
I started hallucinating behind the stuff.

170
00:15:22,997 --> 00:15:26,475
God knows what I really said
to those two flatfeet.

171
00:15:26,545 --> 00:15:29,739
I'm not even sure
how I got out of there.

172
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,835
Did you bring back
tomorrow's bug powder?

173
00:15:32,941 --> 00:15:34,695
Did you, Bill?
Did you?

174
00:15:37,065 --> 00:15:40,804
My God,Joan.
You're acting like a full-fledged junkie.

175
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:44,215
And it's bug powder,
for Christ's sake!

176
00:15:46,305 --> 00:15:48,190
Oh.

177
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:02,829
I do have a little bit of a habit, yes, hon.

178
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:06,538
You ought to at least give me
a few marks for originality.

179
00:16:06,638 --> 00:16:09,353
How did you know
it just wouldn't kill you?

180
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,032
I don't know, Bill.

181
00:16:15,751 --> 00:16:17,692
I felt drawn to it.

182
00:16:17,797 --> 00:16:19,899
You know?

183
00:16:20,003 --> 00:16:24,439
Like you feel drawn... to an old lover.

184
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:30,034
Say, Bill...

185
00:16:30,105 --> 00:16:32,951
could you rub
some of this powder on my lips?

186
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:38,153
Could you, Bill?

187
00:16:39,825 --> 00:16:41,712
Please?

188
00:17:31,812 --> 00:17:33,883
Hey!

189
00:17:35,361 --> 00:17:38,523
Bill.

190
00:17:41,052 --> 00:17:42,960
Hey, where were you this morning?

191
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:44,886
We missed you at the Automat.

192
00:17:45,976 --> 00:17:48,242
I, uh, got in a bit of a jam.

193
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,471
I misplaced the gear,
in a manner of speaking.

194
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,871
Yeah.
We heard about it.

195
00:17:53,969 --> 00:17:57,610
We saw you go off with the heat, in fact.

196
00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:01,055
They won't give it back to Cohen.

197
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,983
It's evidence, they say.

198
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:06,820
Yeah. It's an embarrassment, yes.

199
00:18:08,485 --> 00:18:11,198
Is that why you tried to lift mine?

200
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:15,702
That's unkind, Edward.

201
00:18:15,807 --> 00:18:18,421
"Lift" is unkind.

202
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,058
I'm doing a job for a friend.

203
00:18:24,086 --> 00:18:28,969
The centipedes, Edward.
The centipedes are getting downright arrogant.

204
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,982
They're starting to attack his children.

205
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:33,803
Take it from me, Bill.

206
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,478
You're not the first one
to develop a bug powder problem.

207
00:18:37,546 --> 00:18:39,520
See this man.

208
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,371
He'll help ya.

209
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,566
"Dr. A. Benway...

210
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:48,185
General Practitioner."

211
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:51,100
Bug powder?

212
00:18:52,093 --> 00:18:54,197
- You mean, uh, pyrethrum?
- Yes.

213
00:18:55,322 --> 00:18:59,149
Hmm. I get a lot of you folks
in the extermination trade.

214
00:19:00,502 --> 00:19:03,630
You better help this friend of yours
get off the yellow stuff.

215
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:07,143
- It'll kill him.
- How do I get him to kick?

216
00:19:08,175 --> 00:19:11,271
- Kick?
- H-How do I get him off it?

217
00:19:11,372 --> 00:19:13,258
Oh.

218
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,741
Mix it with this.

219
00:19:17,736 --> 00:19:21,081
Gradually increase the percentage of black
without telling your friend...

220
00:19:21,187 --> 00:19:23,770
and he'll lose his taste
for the bug powder soon enough.

221
00:19:30,523 --> 00:19:32,344
What is it?
What does it do?

222
00:19:32,441 --> 00:19:35,439
Oh, it's all natural.
It's made from, uh...

223
00:19:35,512 --> 00:19:39,087
aquatic Brazilian centipede
or some such outlandish thing.

224
00:19:39,156 --> 00:19:43,277
It shuts down the brain's
response to the bug powder. That's all.

225
00:19:43,345 --> 00:19:45,230
The powder becomes
irrelevant to the addict...

226
00:19:45,487 --> 00:19:47,874
and the addict then
ceases to be addicted.

227
00:19:47,982 --> 00:19:50,532
Side effects?

228
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,510
Nothing that will surprise the addict.

229
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:57,663
But, uh, before I -
before I do your cure...

230
00:19:57,925 --> 00:19:59,810
I've gotta score some bug powder.

231
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:02,879
Score?

232
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:07,063
You're not trying to... pull a fast one
on the old doctor, are you?

233
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:08,984
I came here for help.

234
00:20:10,457 --> 00:20:12,398
Of course you did.

235
00:20:16,436 --> 00:20:18,290
Phew!

236
00:20:18,355 --> 00:20:20,208
My God.

237
00:20:20,273 --> 00:20:24,045
It smells like a... tainted cheese.

238
00:20:26,444 --> 00:20:29,223
You'll see how elegantly this works.

239
00:20:30,887 --> 00:20:32,773
The black will disappear completely.

240
00:20:41,118 --> 00:20:43,504
And there'll be no smell,
no discoloration.

241
00:20:44,986 --> 00:20:46,808
It's like an agent -

242
00:20:46,905 --> 00:20:49,391
an agent who's come to believe
his own cover story...

243
00:20:49,462 --> 00:20:52,308
but who's in there, hiding...

244
00:20:52,564 --> 00:20:54,831
in a larval state...

245
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:57,742
just waiting
for the proper moment to hatch out.

246
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:13,145
Extra, extra.! Read all about it.!

247
00:21:34,255 --> 00:21:36,293
Thirty-nine cents,just for today.! Special.

248
00:21:36,397 --> 00:21:38,599
Thirty-nine cents.
Fresh cabbage.

249
00:21:52,384 --> 00:21:54,585
Centipedes.

250

263
00:23:08,317 --> 00:23:11,631
Hi, Bill.

264
00:23:13,082 --> 00:23:15,054
Say, why don't you and I join them?

265
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,643
Hank and I were just bored.
It wasn't serious.

266
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:56,561
I didn't take it seriously.

267
00:23:56,627 --> 00:23:58,534
Where is Hank?

268
00:23:58,641 --> 00:24:00,712
He got embarrassed and left.

269
00:24:01,903 --> 00:24:03,788
Not before he came, I hope.

270
00:24:03,884 --> 00:24:06,248
Hank's on junk.
He doesn't come.

271
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:10,211
Not before you came, I hope.

272
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:13,921
I'm on bug powder.
I don't need to come.

273
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:18,206
"Officials of unconstituted police states...

279
00:24:38,446 --> 00:24:42,272
I guess it's about time
for our William Tell routine.

280
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:21,832
Oh, God.

281
00:25:21,897 --> 00:25:23,750
Oh, God.

282
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:29,592
Joan.

283
00:25:29,698 --> 00:25:31,584
Joan.

284
00:25:34,525 --> 00:25:36,411
Oh,Joan.

285
00:26:15,961 --> 00:26:18,544
Are you a faggot?

286
00:26:24,465 --> 00:26:27,311
Not by nature, no.

287
00:26:27,407 --> 00:26:29,292
I'm not.

288
00:26:30,477 --> 00:26:33,376
I wouldn't say... faggot.

289
00:26:33,641 --> 00:26:35,528
No.

290
00:26:37,286 --> 00:26:41,756
However, circumstances have forced me
to consider the possibility that -

291
00:26:45,247 --> 00:26:48,146
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.

292
00:26:48,252 --> 00:26:50,421
He specializes in sexual ambivalence.

293
00:26:52,536 --> 00:26:54,390
Sexual ambulance, did you say?

294
00:27:00,562 --> 00:27:02,415
My God.

295
00:27:02,511 --> 00:27:04,333
He's called Mugwump.

296
00:27:08,235 --> 00:27:10,273
No point in feigning surprise.

297
00:27:10,345 --> 00:27:13,245
You knew we would be
getting in touch with you.

298
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,958
Why else would you come
to a waterfront dive like this?

299
00:27:18,018 --> 00:27:19,840
Why else?

300
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:22,836
I suggest a Clark Nova portable.

301
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:25,176
It has mythic resonance.

302
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:28,749
Clark Nova. A typewriter?
You suggest it for what?

303
00:27:28,824 --> 00:27:32,083
For your report
from Interzone, of course.

304
00:27:32,181 --> 00:27:35,407
Handwriting is not
considered professional.

305
00:27:35,506 --> 00:27:37,360
Interzone.

306
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:40,270
My report.

307
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:44,193
And don't leave out
any of the tasty details -

308
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,686
the small red hole in the forehead...

309
00:27:46,794 --> 00:27:48,614
or...

310
00:27:48,712 --> 00:27:51,044
the look of astonishment on her face.

311
00:27:53,283 --> 00:27:57,142
Listen to me.
You'rejust gonna have to leave town...

312
00:27:57,216 --> 00:27:59,070
and Interzone is the only place...

313
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:02,459
that'll have a shady character
like you at such short notice.

314
00:28:02,523 --> 00:28:04,376
Take this.

315
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:07,254
Take what?
What is that?

316
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,717
Your ticket to Interzone.

317
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:12,016
Tourist class, I'm afraid...

318
00:28:12,116 --> 00:28:14,829
but what can you expect these days?

319
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,539
We'll contact you there.

320
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:54,626
Hmm. It's commie trash.

321
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:57,633
And it's been fired very recently.

322
00:28:57,738 --> 00:28:59,744
You use it in a holdup?

323
00:29:01,608 --> 00:29:04,768
I want that-that typewriter in the window.
I want the portable.

324
00:29:09,217 --> 00:29:11,124
This plus...

325
00:29:11,231 --> 00:29:13,116
$8.00.

326
00:29:14,396 --> 00:29:16,695
You got any ammo to go with it?

327
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,796
These'll cover the state tax.

328
00:29:32,909 --> 00:29:35,241
- Bill.
- Martin.

329
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:40,674
Listen, Bill, I told the police
it was a drunken accident, that I saw it.

330
00:29:40,741 --> 00:29:43,041
So at least that's on the record.
They're after you though.

331
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:45,657
They're saying that -
that you escaped from custody...

332
00:29:45,761 --> 00:29:49,074
and murdered your wife,
and-and they want you.

333
00:29:51,163 --> 00:29:53,495
I'd better-
I'd better lie low till my ship sails.

334
00:29:53,594 --> 00:29:56,907
- You booked passage somewhere already?
- Sure. Look.

335
00:29:57,015 --> 00:29:59,347
Got my ticket.

336
00:29:59,443 --> 00:30:02,508
Put this away,
for God's sake, Bill.

337
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,844
- I'll send you a report.
- You'll send me a report?

338
00:30:04,943 --> 00:30:07,875
Well, I'll send you
a copy of the report.

339
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,532
Are you gonna be all right?

340
00:30:12,361 --> 00:30:14,400
I hear Interzone's really nice
this time of year.

341
00:31:07,225 --> 00:31:09,263
He woke up in bed...

342
00:31:09,337 --> 00:31:11,952
to find himself wedged...

343
00:31:12,054 --> 00:31:13,907
between a Dutch transvestite...

344
00:31:14,004 --> 00:31:17,448
and six Arab men.

345
00:31:18,736 --> 00:31:20,588
Clark Nova.

346
00:31:21,676 --> 00:31:23,715
Very nice for writing reports.

347
00:31:26,312 --> 00:31:29,986
I use a Krups Dominator myself.

348
00:31:32,004 --> 00:31:34,141
Company policy.

349
00:31:43,225 --> 00:31:45,112
You're American, correct?

350
00:31:47,383 --> 00:31:49,289
You know Dr. Benway?

351
00:31:51,506 --> 00:31:54,951
I am interested in selling...

352
00:31:55,055 --> 00:31:56,996
a large stash of the black meat.

353
00:31:57,101 --> 00:31:58,922
Verstehen Sie?

354
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:01,668
The sun-dried, powdered black meat...

355
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:06,403
of the giant aquatic Brazilian centipede.

356
00:32:06,469 --> 00:32:08,355
And...

357
00:32:09,538 --> 00:32:12,383
for some reason...

358
00:32:12,481 --> 00:32:17,430
I am certain that you are working
for Herr Dr. Benway.

359
00:32:20,826 --> 00:32:22,863
I'm - I-I-I'm sorry.

360
00:32:22,967 --> 00:32:25,070
I apparently mistook you
for somebody else.

361
00:32:25,332 --> 00:32:28,646
But as it happens, Mr. Lee,
I am, among other things...

362
00:32:28,753 --> 00:32:32,011
a provider of rare services to the arts...

363
00:32:32,111 --> 00:32:36,863
and in my experience
as a provider of rare services to the arts...

364
00:32:36,971 --> 00:32:40,067
I have found that writers
are a-a particularly needy group.

365
00:32:41,223 --> 00:32:44,253
Is there nothing
I can provide for you...

366
00:32:45,475 --> 00:32:47,132
Mr. Lee?

367
00:33:16,776 --> 00:33:19,327
A very professional...

368
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,251
operation...

369
00:33:22,308 --> 00:33:24,248
as you can see, Mr. Lee.

370
00:33:26,752 --> 00:33:28,539
You like a taste?

371
00:33:29,853 --> 00:33:33,396
I'd be happy to join you in a taste,
if you're planning to have one.

372
00:33:51,913 --> 00:33:55,772
You can understand
that if you were...

373
00:33:55,878 --> 00:34:00,184
a purchasing agent
for a foreign power...

374
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:03,135
how it would be
to my advantage...

375
00:34:03,232 --> 00:34:06,490
to impress you with the cleanliness...

376
00:34:06,588 --> 00:34:09,303
and the sincerity...

377
00:34:09,403 --> 00:34:11,376
of our operation.

378
00:34:13,687 --> 00:34:16,945
- You, uh, mentioned a Dr. -
- Benway.

379
00:34:17,043 --> 00:34:19,561
- Benway.
- Benway. Correct.

380
00:34:19,665 --> 00:34:21,518
Yes.

381
00:34:22,574 --> 00:34:24,428
Does he qualify as a foreign power?

382
00:34:24,524 --> 00:34:28,318
Oh, but yes!
He's very foreign.

383
00:34:39,263 --> 00:34:41,116
May I?

384
00:34:43,485 --> 00:34:45,369
Yes.

385
00:35:41,769 --> 00:35:44,669
Lee, wake up.

386
00:35:44,774 --> 00:35:46,627
This is no time to doze off...

387
00:35:46,693 --> 00:35:50,072
like a freckled-face boy
on a fishing raft.

388
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:56,476
What's up?

389
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:05,676
Now, now, Bill.
No need for that.

390
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:09,073
You didn't think
we'd abandon you, did ya?

391
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:12,427
No, no. The thought
never occurred to me.

392
00:36:12,527 --> 00:36:15,241
Good. We like confidence in an agent.

393
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,119
But don't let it make you careless.

394
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,038
I was, uh -

395
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,403
I was just in the...

396
00:36:23,429 --> 00:36:26,209
process of configuring my report.

397
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:30,164
That's good, Lee. Admirable.

398
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,538
But there have been some changes -

399
00:36:32,605 --> 00:36:35,090
- Changes at the top.
- Oh? Yeah?

400
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:38,934
Good changes, Bill.
Fresh blood. Sparkling insights.

401
00:36:40,438 --> 00:36:44,230
Uh, Bill, could you do me a favor?

402
00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:48,269
What?

403
00:36:49,549 --> 00:36:52,166
I want you to type
a few words into me -

404
00:36:52,268 --> 00:36:54,306
words that I'll dictate to ya.

405
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:59,067
Yeah.

406
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,433
Sure. What the hell.

407
00:37:11,898 --> 00:37:15,060
Okay. Now, the first sentence is...

408
00:37:15,158 --> 00:37:20,010
"Homosexuality is the best
all-around cover an agent ever had."

409
00:37:21,552 --> 00:37:23,820
Aw, come on, Bill.

410
00:37:27,692 --> 00:37:30,657
Don't be such a pansy!
Be forceful.

411
00:37:30,761 --> 00:37:32,964
Hurt me.

412
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:45,719
I love it.

413
00:37:45,788 --> 00:37:49,527
That is a great sentence.

414
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:52,589
These are words to live by, Bill.

415
00:37:52,695 --> 00:37:56,107
I'm glad these words
are going into your report.

416
00:37:56,211 --> 00:37:59,207
Our new management will be so pleased...

417
00:37:59,312 --> 00:38:01,731
that you see our point of view.

418
00:38:04,267 --> 00:38:06,121
What -What point of view?

419
00:38:06,218 --> 00:38:09,315
Well, uh,just that we appreciate...

420
00:38:09,384 --> 00:38:14,714
that you might find the thought
of engaging in, uh, homosexual acts...

421
00:38:14,818 --> 00:38:18,460
morally and, uh, possibly even...

422
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,761
physically repulsive...

423
00:38:20,863 --> 00:38:23,762
and, uh, we are encouraged...

424
00:38:23,867 --> 00:38:28,053
that you are able to overcome
these personal, uh, barriers...

425
00:38:28,151 --> 00:38:32,458
to better serve the cause
to which we are all so devoted.

426
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,824
You have left the Clark Nova at home?

427
00:38:51,171 --> 00:38:53,439
It's doing all right without me.

428
00:39:02,489 --> 00:39:04,343
And, uh...

429
00:39:05,398 --> 00:39:09,257
you have contacted Dr. Benway?

430
00:39:11,985 --> 00:39:13,926
I told you before
I never met the man.

431
00:39:14,031 --> 00:39:17,377
Bill, I can smell him on you.

432
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:22,082
Benway marks out all those
whom he has met like a lemur...

433
00:39:22,184 --> 00:39:25,410
pissing on a liana vine
to mark his territory.

434
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:28,480
You're a marked man, Bill.

435
00:39:37,883 --> 00:39:39,790
Joanie.

436
00:39:39,896 --> 00:39:42,611
Joanie, shall we go?

437
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,530
Yes. Yes.

438
00:39:51,118 --> 00:39:55,010
Hans. Hans, that couple.

439
00:39:55,114 --> 00:39:57,184
Who are they?

440
00:39:57,288 --> 00:40:00,134
They are Tom and Joan Frost.

441
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:04,667
Americans who have lived here
a very long time.

442
00:40:04,771 --> 00:40:06,808
They're both writers.

443
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,529
Writers of fiction, like you.

444
00:40:11,356 --> 00:40:13,362
They live in a nice flat...

445
00:40:13,436 --> 00:40:15,855
in the new building
at the foot of the mountain.

446
00:40:15,961 --> 00:40:18,675
They're visited constantly...

447
00:40:18,741 --> 00:40:22,087
by many handsome,
young Interzone men.

448
00:40:22,195 --> 00:40:24,365
Sometimes...

449
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:27,877
two or three at a time.

450
00:40:29,196 --> 00:40:30,886
Can you, uh, introduce me?

451
00:40:31,115 --> 00:40:36,293
I do not think
it would be to your advantage.

452
00:40:37,415 --> 00:40:39,234
For some reason...

453
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:43,703
that woman has taken
a serious dislike to me.

454
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,631
Kiki.

455
00:40:46,655 --> 00:40:48,660
Come sit with us.

456
00:40:54,551 --> 00:40:57,484
Kiki, this is Mr. Lee.

457
00:40:57,557 --> 00:40:59,497
Hello.

458
00:40:59,603 --> 00:41:03,429
Mr. Lee is curious about the Frost couple.

459
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:05,930
He would like to meet them.

460
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,450
I think the woman would have
sex with you, Mr. Lee.

461
00:41:09,642 --> 00:41:13,413
The man, he only likes Interzone boys.

462
00:41:14,853 --> 00:41:18,079
I don't want to fuck 'em.
I just want to talk to 'em.

463
00:41:18,178 --> 00:41:20,664
You know how
Americans are, Kiki.

464
00:41:20,768 --> 00:41:22,655
They love to travel...

465
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,974
and then they only want to meet
other Americans...

466
00:41:26,076 --> 00:41:30,709
and talk about how hard it is
to get a decent hamburger.

467
00:41:30,808 --> 00:41:33,652
There's a party tonight at the O'Leary place.

468
00:41:33,749 --> 00:41:36,649
Frost will be meeting
a group of us here...

469
00:41:36,723 --> 00:41:39,208
and then walking
through the casbah.

470
00:41:39,312 --> 00:41:41,797
My friends and I would be happy
to take you with us.

471
00:41:44,714 --> 00:41:47,777
You're the new writer, aren't you?
You've just arrived.

472
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,944
A few days ago.
I write, uh, reports.

473
00:41:51,045 --> 00:41:54,785
Oh? Uh, and did you
come to Interzone for the boys?

474
00:41:56,609 --> 00:41:58,909
- No, I didn't.
- Tom and I did.

475
00:41:59,006 --> 00:42:01,274
That's quite a hot threesome
you arrived with.

476
00:42:01,372 --> 00:42:05,013
They're very cheap,
and they're really a lot of fun.

477
00:42:08,023 --> 00:42:09,876
Yoo-hoo!

478
00:42:14,609 --> 00:42:17,094
You use a Clark Nova, don't you?

479
00:42:20,652 --> 00:42:22,755
To write with. Typewriter.

480
00:42:22,825 --> 00:42:24,678
Oh, I do. Yes.

481
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:27,326
I wouldn't use a Clark Nova myself.

482
00:42:27,429 --> 00:42:30,176
- Too demanding.
- Demanding?

483
00:42:31,266 --> 00:42:34,133
Oh, come on. We're both writers.
We know what we're talking about.

484
00:42:35,327 --> 00:42:38,226
Well, I'm new to this game,
to tell you the truth.

485
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:42,895
If I get blocked again,
I'll let you try my Martinelli.

486
00:42:44,023 --> 00:42:45,997
Her inventiveness will surprise you.

487
00:42:47,284 --> 00:42:49,617
I can't wait.

488
00:42:51,312 --> 00:42:53,166
They say you murdered your wife.

489
00:42:54,925 --> 00:42:57,225
- Is that true?
- Who told you that?

490
00:42:57,322 --> 00:42:59,622
Word gets around.

491
00:42:59,722 --> 00:43:02,850
It wasn't murder.
It was an accident.

492
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,827
There are no accidents.

493
00:43:09,696 --> 00:43:12,061
For example...

494
00:43:13,564 --> 00:43:16,431
I've been killing my own wife slowly,
over a period of years.

495
00:43:16,537 --> 00:43:18,805
- What?
- Well, not intentionally.

496
00:43:18,904 --> 00:43:22,960
I mean, on the level of conscious intention,
it's insane, monstrous.

497
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:26,669
But you do consciously know it.
You just said it. We're discussing it.

498
00:43:27,889 --> 00:43:29,710
Not consciously.

499
00:43:30,959 --> 00:43:33,345
This is all happening...
telepathically.

500
00:43:33,453 --> 00:43:36,319
- Nonconsciously.
- What do you mean?

501
00:43:38,056 --> 00:43:40,542
If you look carefully at my lips...

502
00:43:40,646 --> 00:43:43,327
you'll realize
that I'm actually saying something else.

503
00:43:43,395 --> 00:43:46,175
I'm not actually telling you
about the several ways...

504
00:43:46,272 --> 00:43:48,180
I'm gradually murdering Joan -

505
00:43:48,287 --> 00:43:50,674
about the housekeeper Fadela,
whom I've hired...

506
00:43:50,749 --> 00:43:53,464
to makeJoan deathly ill by witchcraft...

507
00:43:53,563 --> 00:43:55,665
about the medicines
and drugs I've given her...

508
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,976
about the constant nibbling away
at her self-esteem and sanity...

509
00:44:01,075 --> 00:44:04,521
that I've managed
without being at all obvious about it.

510
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,673
Whereas Joanie finds that she simply...

511
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:12,191
cannot be as obsessively precise
as she wants to be...

512
00:44:12,266 --> 00:44:16,419
unless she writes
everything in longhand.

513
00:44:18,532 --> 00:44:21,399
Look, uh, I'm afraid, um...

514
00:44:23,712 --> 00:44:27,005
I'm not gonna be
very good company tonight.

515
00:44:27,101 --> 00:44:30,394
Thanks for the invite anyway.
I think I'll - I'll have to take a rain check.

516
00:44:33,782 --> 00:44:35,668
Oh.

517
00:44:49,033 --> 00:44:50,887
Enjoying the beach?

518
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:59,806
I would never have expected
to see you up and out so early.

519
00:45:00,928 --> 00:45:03,892
You certainly were in rough shape
at the O'Leary party last night.

520
00:45:03,964 --> 00:45:06,329
Was I?

521
00:45:09,271 --> 00:45:12,846
You were very raw -
emotionally, I mean.

522
00:45:12,916 --> 00:45:16,109
You seemed to be in a lot of pain.

523
00:45:16,209 --> 00:45:18,030
Pain.

524
00:45:19,631 --> 00:45:22,726
I don't remember... pain.

525
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:28,255
And, in fact, I don't remember
the O'Leary party.

526
00:45:29,669 --> 00:45:31,707
In fact, I don't remember you.

527
00:45:32,994 --> 00:45:35,862
Well, it was a very intense
performance in any case.

528
00:45:37,343 --> 00:45:39,163
My name's Cloquet.

529
00:45:44,888 --> 00:45:46,741
Yves Cloquet.

530
00:45:48,725 --> 00:45:51,211
Can I buy you breakfast?

531
00:46:01,195 --> 00:46:04,640
I've seen you around,
but I had no idea you were queer.

532
00:46:06,725 --> 00:46:08,578
Queer.

533
00:46:08,644 --> 00:46:11,937
I saw you arrive
with those three Interzone boys.

534
00:46:12,033 --> 00:46:13,887
What an entrance.

535
00:46:14,143 --> 00:46:16,213
You all looked very...

536
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:18,225
familiar with each other.

537
00:46:19,386 --> 00:46:21,272
Queer.

538
00:46:22,839 --> 00:46:25,423
A curse.
Been in our family for generations.

539
00:46:25,686 --> 00:46:28,269
The Lees have always been perverts.

540
00:46:30,257 --> 00:46:34,051
I shall never forget
the unspeakable horror...

541
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:37,664
that froze the lymph in my glands...

542
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:42,468
when the baneful word seared
my reeling brain -

543
00:46:42,535 --> 00:46:44,441
I...

544
00:46:44,549 --> 00:46:46,402
was a homosexual.

545
00:46:47,873 --> 00:46:51,167
I thought of the painted,
simpering female impersonators...

546
00:46:51,263 --> 00:46:53,530
I had seen in a Baltimore nightclub.

547
00:46:55,675 --> 00:46:59,153
Could it be possible
I was one of those subhuman things?

548
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:04,457
I walked the streets in a daze...

549
00:47:04,563 --> 00:47:07,049
like a man with a light concussion.

550
00:47:07,152 --> 00:47:09,703
I would have destroyed myself-

551
00:47:10,926 --> 00:47:12,811
But a wise old queen-

552
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:16,805
Bobo, we called her-

553
00:47:17,832 --> 00:47:19,685
taught me that I had a duty...

554
00:47:19,782 --> 00:47:24,121
to live and to bear my burden
proudly for all to see.

555
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:28,151
Poor Bobo came to a sticky end.

556
00:47:29,501 --> 00:47:33,360
He was riding in
the Duc de Ventre's Hispano-Suiza...

557
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,976
when his falling hemorrhoids
blew out of the car...

558
00:47:37,078 --> 00:47:39,443
and wrapped around the rear wheel.

559
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:43,367
He was completely gutted,
leaving an empty shell...

560
00:47:43,473 --> 00:47:46,786
sitting there
on the giraffe-skin upholstery.

561
00:47:51,594 --> 00:47:53,413
Even the eyes and the brain went...

562
00:47:53,511 --> 00:47:56,739
with a horrible "schlupping" sound.

563
00:47:59,012 --> 00:48:03,611
The duke says he will carry that ghastly
schlup with him to his mausoleum.

564
00:48:07,515 --> 00:48:11,190
You sound as if you could use a drink.
My place?

565
00:48:12,278 --> 00:48:14,165
A drink.

566
00:48:19,154 --> 00:48:21,039
A drink?

567
00:48:22,126 --> 00:48:23,947
No.

568
00:48:24,045 --> 00:48:26,759
No, I can't. I gotta go home.

569
00:48:26,826 --> 00:48:29,279
I have a -
I have a -

570
00:48:29,384 --> 00:48:31,454
I have a report to write.
Excuse me.

571
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:56,472
Hmm.

572
00:50:33,115 --> 00:50:35,830
You made a big hit
with our young friend Yves.

573
00:50:40,693 --> 00:50:43,179
- Yves?
- Cloquet.

574
00:50:45,489 --> 00:50:48,520
Yves said you were wonderfully funny.

575
00:50:48,622 --> 00:50:53,222
Said you did a little routine that made him...
chuckle to himself all day.

576
00:50:59,237 --> 00:51:01,123
Yes, you-you could, um -

577
00:51:03,105 --> 00:51:06,168
You could probably get him into bed
if you worked at it a bit.

578
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:09,591
Deadly aphrodisiac, humor.

579
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:11,795
I'm not, uh -

580
00:51:11,898 --> 00:51:14,132
I don't really-

581
00:51:16,981 --> 00:51:18,835
Have you seen Hans around?

582
00:51:18,933 --> 00:51:21,712
Oh, you mean you haven't heard?

583
00:51:23,951 --> 00:51:26,187
No. I haven't heard.

584
00:51:26,286 --> 00:51:28,738
Hans was arrested and deported
two weeks ago.

585
00:51:30,666 --> 00:51:32,551
- Deported.
- Mm-hmm.

586
00:51:34,918 --> 00:51:37,218
They let him take his clothes
and his passport.

587
00:51:37,316 --> 00:51:40,859
That was it.
Everything else - nationalized, as they say.

588
00:51:42,048 --> 00:51:43,869
Why?

589
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:47,738
He neglected to pay
the right officials, I think.

590
00:51:47,803 --> 00:51:50,135
You knew he ran
a drug factory in the medina?

591
00:51:54,101 --> 00:51:56,521
What, um -

592
00:51:59,345 --> 00:52:01,165
What drug did he manufacture?

593
00:52:01,263 --> 00:52:03,400
Nothing too exotic.

594
00:52:03,501 --> 00:52:07,753
Majoun, I think.
It's a local hash resin-almond paste.

595
00:52:07,818 --> 00:52:09,725
You'd spread it on a muffin likejam.

596
00:52:09,831 --> 00:52:12,131
Try it.

597
00:52:25,082 --> 00:52:27,894
While you're at it,
why don't you try my Martinelli?

598
00:52:31,286 --> 00:52:33,138
Take her now.

599
00:52:34,962 --> 00:52:36,815
Try her out.

600
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:24,879
Holy shit. That machine doesn't
belong to me. It's Tom Frost's.

601
00:54:24,976 --> 00:54:26,798
My God, Lee...

602
00:54:26,895 --> 00:54:30,209
Surely you know better than to bring
an enemy agent into your own home.

603
00:54:30,317 --> 00:54:35,364
You gave me no choice. You were giving her
access to your innermost vulnerabilities...

604
00:54:35,465 --> 00:54:37,350
forcing them on her,
for God's sake!

605
00:54:37,446 --> 00:54:39,299
But what am I gonna tell him?

606
00:54:39,364 --> 00:54:41,402
What's your assessment of the situation?

607
00:54:41,508 --> 00:54:44,374
Did Frost know that his machine
was an Interzonal agent?

608
00:54:47,166 --> 00:54:51,285
He, uh - He and his wife
appear to have a close connection...

609
00:54:51,386 --> 00:54:54,034
with the indigenous population here.

610
00:54:56,438 --> 00:54:58,378
His wife.
Yeah, yeah!

611
00:54:58,484 --> 00:55:01,329
Of course!
The key is Joan Frost.

612
00:55:01,425 --> 00:55:05,730
You will seduce her, and you will discover
the substance of her report...

613
00:55:05,997 --> 00:55:08,035
and deliver it directly to me.

614
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,275
Seduce her?
But what about -

615
00:55:10,345 --> 00:55:12,962
What about Kiki and
the Interzone boys? My cover.

616
00:55:13,063 --> 00:55:16,802
It'll work beautifully, Bill.
The opposition will be thrown into total confusion.

617
00:56:05,211 --> 00:56:08,470
- Tom's gone out with the boys.
- I came to see you.

618
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:12,173
Oh.

619
00:56:29,543 --> 00:56:33,369
There's a great restaurant
in New York looks just like this.

620
00:56:33,474 --> 00:56:35,328
Oh, really?

621
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:48,625
- You write in longhand.
- Yes.

622
00:56:49,685 --> 00:56:52,845
I'm not good with machines.
They intimidate me.

623
00:56:53,105 --> 00:56:54,795
I think I broke Tom's typewriter.

624
00:56:55,055 --> 00:56:58,282
The Martinelli?
He'll be furious.

625
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:02,752
- Does he have another one?
- He has that one, the Mujahideen.

626
00:57:02,825 --> 00:57:06,051
- It's Arabic.
- Does he use it much?

627
00:57:06,151 --> 00:57:08,418
Not much.

628
00:57:08,517 --> 00:57:10,369
What happened to the Martinelli?

629
00:57:10,466 --> 00:57:13,847
I probably just
threw it on the floor and smashed it.

630
00:57:13,951 --> 00:57:16,186
Probably? You don't know?

631
00:57:16,286 --> 00:57:18,423
I suffer from, um...

632
00:57:18,523 --> 00:57:20,409
sporadic hallucinations.

633
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:24,502
Join the club.

634
00:57:28,659 --> 00:57:30,991
Do you intend to kill Tom's Mujahideen?

635
00:57:32,879 --> 00:57:34,732
Only in self-defense.

636
00:57:34,797 --> 00:57:36,933
I understood writing
could be dangerous.

637
00:57:37,195 --> 00:57:39,527
I didn't realize the danger
came from the machinery.

638
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,624
- What are you talking about?
- I'll show you.

639
00:57:42,727 --> 00:57:44,548
Oh.

640
00:57:51,647 --> 00:57:53,979
- Are you gonna write something in Arabic?
- No.

641
00:57:55,771 --> 00:57:57,810
You are.

642
00:57:57,914 --> 00:58:01,619
I don't like using Tom's things.

643
00:58:01,718 --> 00:58:04,203
We don't trespass on each other.

644
00:58:06,227 --> 00:58:09,126
Do you have any objection
to trying some of this?

645
00:58:11,981 --> 00:58:14,695
I can't read it.
Is it erotic?

646
00:58:14,761 --> 00:58:16,800
It's, um, fairly erotic.

647
00:58:16,905 --> 00:58:18,725
- Kind of uncivilized.
- More erotic.

648
00:58:20,677 --> 00:58:22,880
Filthier.

649
00:58:22,948 --> 00:58:26,588
- Filthier? Okay.
- All you think about.

650
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:32,251
- Followers of obsolete, unthinkable trades...
- Getting really...

651
00:58:32,348 --> 00:58:34,898
- pretty good here.
- doodling in Etruscan...

652
00:58:35,001 --> 00:58:38,926
- addicts of drugs not yet synthesized...
- I'm surpassing myself here.

653
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:41,483
black marketeers of World War III...

654
00:58:41,587 --> 00:58:43,887
excisors of telepathic sensitivity...

655
00:58:43,986 --> 00:58:47,278
followers of obsolete,
unthinkable trades.

656
00:58:47,342 --> 00:58:50,187
Ooh, this is very good.

657
00:58:50,284 --> 00:58:53,150
- Addicts of drugs not yet synthesized-
- Very, very dirty.

658
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:58,299
World War III...

659
00:58:58,406 --> 00:59:01,185
excisors of telepathic sensitivity...

660
00:59:02,211 --> 00:59:04,695
osteopaths of the spirit...

661
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:08,309
investigators of infractions...

662
00:59:08,412 --> 00:59:12,435
denounced by bland,
paranoid chess players.

663
00:59:27,212 --> 00:59:29,032
Joan.

664
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:31,015
Oh,Joan.

665
00:59:55,187 --> 00:59:56,844
Mrs. Frost!

666
00:59:57,105 --> 00:59:59,689
This is an evil
and insane thing that you are doing.

667
00:59:59,791 --> 01:00:02,026
You must stop it at once!

668
01:00:07,721 --> 01:00:09,606
Pull up your hair.

669
01:00:14,692 --> 01:00:16,512
Who's that?

670
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:18,462
Oh, my housekeeper.

671
01:01:15,023 --> 01:01:16,908
It's my Mujahideen.

672
01:01:20,649 --> 01:01:23,102
For God's sake!

673
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:36,370
Itjumped of its own accord.

674
01:01:36,476 --> 01:01:38,678
You did see that, didn't you?

675
01:01:42,071 --> 01:01:44,458
Joan, are you all right?
What happened?

676
01:01:45,587 --> 01:01:49,381
Fadela stormed in here, and-and
she threw your typewriter out the window.

677
01:01:50,672 --> 01:01:52,579
Well, that's it.
The woman has to go.

678
01:01:52,686 --> 01:01:55,400
She certainly seemed deadly to me.

679
01:01:55,499 --> 01:01:58,758
Oh, I knew it.

680
01:01:59,975 --> 01:02:02,045
Look, Tom.

681
01:02:02,149 --> 01:02:04,035
Look.

682
01:02:06,817 --> 01:02:09,663
This is how Fadela's
been controlling you,Joan.

683
01:02:10,686 --> 01:02:13,139
Your blood, your pubic hair,
your fingernails.

684
01:02:13,244 --> 01:02:15,446
Fadela controls nobody,
and you know it.

685
01:02:15,514 --> 01:02:17,400
We have forced control upon her.

686
01:02:17,497 --> 01:02:19,915
Poor woman's probably desperate
to get out of our household.

687
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:22,705
No, missus.
She's making you say everything...

688
01:02:22,804 --> 01:02:24,625
even that.

689
01:02:24,722 --> 01:02:27,916
You must find all of these in your house.
You must destroy them.

690
01:02:30,797 --> 01:02:33,544
Bill...

691
01:02:33,642 --> 01:02:35,527
I'm going to need my Martinelli.

692
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:40,516
I feel desperately insecure
without a typewriter in the house.

693
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:45,145
Yes, well, I haven't had a chance to try it out
yet, Tom. I was kind of hoping -

694
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:48,093
I'll leave Hafid here with you,Joanie,
in case Fadela comes back.

695
01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:51,984
Bill and I will go to his place
and pick up the Martinelli now.

696
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:54,031
I'll go with Bill.
You two stay here.

697
01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:55,957
I need to get out.

698
01:03:12,169 --> 01:03:15,482
Fadela's within 30 feet of us.
See if you can find her.

699
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:25,397
There.

700
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:27,356
She's right there.

701
01:03:35,605 --> 01:03:38,024
That thing she's cutting up...

702
01:03:39,793 --> 01:03:41,734
have you ever seen that before?

703
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:43,746
No.

704
01:03:43,854 --> 01:03:46,721
Looks like some kind of
sea creature, I think.

705
01:03:46,827 --> 01:03:49,574
All those women...

706
01:03:49,672 --> 01:03:51,906
they work for her?

707
01:03:52,006 --> 01:03:55,298
In a sense.
They're all Fadela's lovers.

708
01:04:02,174 --> 01:04:04,855
I'm going to have to -

709
01:04:04,956 --> 01:04:08,498
I'm gonna have to
stay here with Fadela -

710
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,573
do penance.

711
01:06:18,151 --> 01:06:20,125
I've been instructed to reveal to you...

712
01:06:20,389 --> 01:06:23,649
that you were programmed
to shoot your wife,Joan Lee.

713
01:06:23,747 --> 01:06:26,678
It was not an act
of free will on your part.

714
01:06:28,286 --> 01:06:30,172
Hey!

715
01:06:32,156 --> 01:06:34,390
Who the fuck asked ya?

716
01:06:36,279 --> 01:06:38,189
You worry me, Bill.

717
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:41,587
You cause me many anxious moments.

718
01:06:41,684 --> 01:06:44,430
Oh, gee, I hope you're not
losing any sleep.

719
01:06:44,497 --> 01:06:46,503
No need to be nasty, Bill.

720
01:06:46,606 --> 01:06:50,313
There was some thought that you might
actually want to hear this information -

721
01:06:50,411 --> 01:06:53,443
that it might assuage your guilt.

722
01:06:53,545 --> 01:06:58,080
Save the psychoanalysis
for your grasshopper friends.

723
01:06:58,149 --> 01:07:02,269
You have to admit,
it was a pretty tasty setup, Bill.

724
01:07:02,337 --> 01:07:04,986
Joan marries you as part
ofher agent's cover...

725
01:07:05,055 --> 01:07:09,012
not realizing that you were
the very enemy agent assigned to kill her.

726
01:07:09,274 --> 01:07:12,305
As elegant as it is brilliant.

727
01:07:21,233 --> 01:07:23,120
Wait a minute.

728
01:07:24,942 --> 01:07:29,444
You're saying thatJoan was sent
by Interzone, Incorporated to marry me?

729
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:34,495
Yeah. In fact, she was sent
to you by Fadela, who was her controller.

730
01:07:34,565 --> 01:07:38,206
We did a lot of groundwork
to set you up in their files...

731
01:07:38,274 --> 01:07:40,377
as the prime candidate for marriage.

732
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,825
And it didn't matter that
I didn't know anything about it?

733
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:46,964
An unconscious agent
is an effective agent, Bill.

734
01:07:47,067 --> 01:07:51,699
The situation does generate
some ethical paradoxes at times.

735
01:07:51,798 --> 01:07:53,803
I'm the first to admit that.

736
01:07:55,284 --> 01:07:58,445
When you bugs first approached me...

737
01:08:00,048 --> 01:08:02,632
one of your associates suggested...

738
01:08:02,733 --> 01:08:05,730
thatJoan was possibly not human.

739
01:08:06,762 --> 01:08:08,898
What did he mean by that?

740
01:08:08,999 --> 01:08:11,550
Women aren't human, Bill.

741
01:08:11,653 --> 01:08:13,506
Or perhaps more precisely...

742
01:08:13,571 --> 01:08:15,545
they're a different species from men...

743
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:19,292
with different wills
and different purposes on Earth.

744
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:21,266
You know this instinctively, Bill...

745
01:08:21,372 --> 01:08:24,915
and it's your instincts
that make you such a good operative.

746
01:08:25,945 --> 01:08:27,950
I'm talking aboutJoan.

747
01:08:30,932 --> 01:08:32,841
IfJoan Lee wasn't human...

748
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:36,142
what was she?

749
01:08:36,208 --> 01:08:39,467
Well,Joan was a special case.

750
01:08:40,685 --> 01:08:43,399
Joan was an elite-corps centipede.

751
01:08:46,791 --> 01:08:48,644
Joan was a centipede.

752
01:08:56,287 --> 01:08:57,878
Where's my Martinelli?

753
01:08:57,981 --> 01:09:00,848
Jesus, Tom, are you nuts?

754
01:09:00,954 --> 01:09:03,886
Don't fuck with me, Lee.
I want my typewriter.

755
01:09:04,950 --> 01:09:07,315
A lot of people have tried to silence me.

756
01:09:08,467 --> 01:09:10,473
All have failed.

757
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:12,617
Tom...

758
01:09:12,881 --> 01:09:14,788
she's here...

759
01:09:14,895 --> 01:09:16,747
in pieces.

760
01:09:18,796 --> 01:09:20,768
I fear it's hopeless.

761
01:09:26,468 --> 01:09:28,409
All right.

762
01:09:28,514 --> 01:09:30,618
We're taking your Clark Nova.

763
01:09:30,721 --> 01:09:32,410
Hafid, the bag.

764
01:09:32,511 --> 01:09:34,397
No.

765
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:37,306
No.

766
01:09:54,796 --> 01:09:58,023
Wh-Wh-What's going on here?

767
01:09:58,089 --> 01:10:00,737
Wait, wait, wait! This is
a heinous mistake you're making.

768
01:10:00,838 --> 01:10:03,105
Lee, do something.
Stop them.

769
01:10:03,204 --> 01:10:06,911
Well, he's got a gun, Clark Nova.
You don't want to lose your best agent, do ya?

770
01:10:07,009 --> 01:10:10,618
You're gonna have to write
a full report, Lee. And I mean full.

771
01:10:10,718 --> 01:10:12,538
How am I gonna write it,
in longhand?

772
01:10:12,636 --> 01:10:14,642
Will you take this sack off!.

773
01:10:14,746 --> 01:10:16,632
This is insubordination.!

774
01:10:16,728 --> 01:10:20,337
Ooh,you're all gonna pay for this.!
Heads are gonna roll.!

775
01:10:20,438 --> 01:10:23,468
Your days in Interzone are numbered, Lee.

776
01:10:24,465 --> 01:10:26,852
I suggest you give up
the writing game.

777
01:10:26,959 --> 01:10:30,219
- Make tracks for another part of the world.
- You guys are gonna-

778
01:10:35,721 --> 01:10:38,783
Fuck 'em all.
Squares on both sides.

779
01:10:39,878 --> 01:10:42,722
I am the only complete man in the industry.

780
01:11:10,282 --> 01:11:12,964
- Bill.
- Bill?

781
01:11:19,714 --> 01:11:23,355
I must be hallucinating.

782
01:11:23,455 --> 01:11:25,275
What are you cats doing here?

783
01:11:25,373 --> 01:11:27,346
We're here to see you, Bill.

784
01:11:27,452 --> 01:11:29,272
Come on.

785
01:11:29,369 --> 01:11:33,360
Yeah, man. It's probably the first time
you haven't been hallucinating in a long time.

786
01:11:33,461 --> 01:11:35,315
What are you talking about?

787
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:39,686
What are you saying?
Naturally, I've had a few odd moments.

788
01:11:39,792 --> 01:11:42,092
Everybody blacks out in Interzone.

789
01:11:42,350 --> 01:11:44,258
- Wouldn't you?
- Definitely.

790
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:46,219
Sure.

791
01:11:49,065 --> 01:11:51,136
What's in the pillowcase, Bill?

792
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:55,230
These are the remains
of my last writing machine.

793
01:11:55,331 --> 01:11:57,402
It's been a big problem for me.

794
01:11:57,665 --> 01:11:59,998
- Mind if I take a look?
- Go ahead.

795
01:12:05,595 --> 01:12:07,764
Wait a minute.
Where are we going?

796
01:12:09,302 --> 01:12:11,123
Oh, man.

797
01:12:11,221 --> 01:12:13,608
- How about back to your place?
- Nope.

798
01:12:13,716 --> 01:12:15,568
Why not?

799
01:12:16,912 --> 01:12:19,113
I'm not safe there.
I'm a dead duck there.

800
01:12:20,813 --> 01:12:22,754
We'll protect you.

801
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:25,705
You boys are kidding yourselves.

802
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:28,833
You're babes in the woods here.

803
01:12:28,934 --> 01:12:30,754
Well, what do you suggest?

804
01:12:30,852 --> 01:12:33,785
We thought it was important for us
to help you get your book together.

805
01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:36,637
Yeah, I've sent sections of it
to my publisher, and they're interested.

806
01:12:36,735 --> 01:12:40,344
- All you gotta do is finish it, man.
- You've already done the hard part.

807
01:12:42,778 --> 01:12:44,686
Book. My book?

808
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:47,059
Yeah. The one
you've been calling Naked Lunch.

809
01:12:52,690 --> 01:12:55,338
Where did you put
that Bradley the Buyer routine?

810
01:12:55,407 --> 01:12:57,260
Did you find it all?

811
01:12:57,357 --> 01:13:00,966
Yeah. It's on the sofa
right next to the Hassan's Rumpus Room riff.

812
01:13:01,034 --> 01:13:03,236
- It's all right there.
- I'm telling you, boys...

813
01:13:03,304 --> 01:13:05,157
I never saw those pages before.

814
01:13:06,341 --> 01:13:09,601
I truly do suspect
some sort of colossal con.

815
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:12,511
Oh, someone's planted
these pages in your room, right?

816
01:13:12,608 --> 01:13:16,533
Somebody sent all those letters to me
and signed them with your name, right?

817
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:20,367
A well-orchestrated cabal
could easily manage...

818
01:13:20,473 --> 01:13:22,643
all of these simple things, children.

819
01:13:22,712 --> 01:13:24,881
When will you learn?

820
01:13:24,981 --> 01:13:28,720
They've done you a favor, 'cause this stuff!s
gonna get published under your name...

821
01:13:28,818 --> 01:13:30,638
and you'll have a career.

822
01:13:30,736 --> 01:13:34,148
Yeah, you'll probably
get into print before we will.

823
01:13:34,253 --> 01:13:37,065
For God's sake, Bill,
play ball with this conspiracy.

824
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:40,296
You're patronizing me, boys...

825
01:13:42,311 --> 01:13:45,123
but I don't mind,
'cause you're so sweet to me, too.

826
01:13:45,189 --> 01:13:47,936
Hey, Martin, listen to this.

827
01:13:48,993 --> 01:13:54,257
"So we start for New Orleans past
iridescent lakes and orange gas flares...

828
01:13:54,364 --> 01:13:56,185
"and swamps and garbage heaps...

829
01:13:56,283 --> 01:14:00,435
"alligators crawling around
in broken bottles and tin cans...

830
01:14:01,686 --> 01:14:03,723
"neon arabesques of motels...

831
01:14:03,828 --> 01:14:09,039
"marooned pimps scream obscenities
at passing cars from islands of rubbish.

832
01:14:10,605 --> 01:14:13,352
New Orleans is a dead museum."

833
01:14:14,442 --> 01:14:16,578
So nice.

834
01:14:16,648 --> 01:14:18,503
Sound familiar, Bill?

835
01:14:21,157 --> 01:14:23,097
First time I ever heard it. Read on.

836
01:14:43,121 --> 01:14:46,828
I think it's time to discuss your, uh...

837
01:14:46,926 --> 01:14:50,665
philosophy of drug use
as it relates to artistic endeavor.

838
01:14:52,202 --> 01:14:54,469
I think it's time
to bring this meeting to order.

839
01:14:56,199 --> 01:15:00,635
I think it's time for you boys
to share my last taste...

840
01:15:00,738 --> 01:15:02,679
of the true black meat.

841
01:15:05,183 --> 01:15:09,434
The flesh of the giant
aquatic Brazilian centipede.

842
01:15:12,824 --> 01:15:16,269
So we're still here
in Interzone with Bill, right?

843
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:18,194
That's right, Hank.

844
01:15:18,292 --> 01:15:20,592
And now we're gonna travel
back to the city, right?

845
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:24,327
- That's right, Hank.
- I think Bill's on top of things here, don't you?

846
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:29,696
He has a grip on a certain, uh,
unique reality principle, yes.

847
01:15:29,801 --> 01:15:32,385
I think you both should consider
staying here for a few months.

848
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:35,681
Everything you could want
is cheap and-and plentiful here.

849
01:15:35,749 --> 01:15:39,095
That reality principle thing
could work for you, too.

850
01:15:40,353 --> 01:15:43,579
Well, my mother's all alone,
and she's kind of sick, Bill.

851
01:15:43,838 --> 01:15:46,105
And besides, my book's
as all-American as football.

852
01:15:47,098 --> 01:15:50,892
- Couldn't finish it here.
- America is not a young land.

853
01:15:52,629 --> 01:15:54,482
It is old...

854
01:15:54,547 --> 01:15:56,552
and dirty and evil.

855
01:15:57,618 --> 01:16:00,104
Before the settlers,
before the Indians.

856
01:16:02,668 --> 01:16:05,535
The evil is there waiting.

857
01:16:12,037 --> 01:16:13,890
What about you, Martin?

858
01:16:16,034 --> 01:16:20,221
Maybe you can, uh, move into my place.

859
01:16:20,318 --> 01:16:22,138
What do you think?

860
01:16:25,497 --> 01:16:28,015
Stay until you finish the book...

861
01:16:28,118 --> 01:16:30,004
but then come back to us.

862
01:16:46,854 --> 01:16:48,675
You'll be okay?

863
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:53,471
Yeah. Don't worry about me.

864
01:16:53,569 --> 01:16:56,915
The Zone is full of surprises.

865
01:16:58,301 --> 01:17:01,145
The Zone takes care of its own.

866
01:17:38,842 --> 01:17:41,653
William?

867
01:17:45,652 --> 01:17:47,789
You look terrible.

868
01:17:47,889 --> 01:17:49,742
What are you doing here?

869
01:17:51,278 --> 01:17:53,165
I don't - I don't know.

870
01:17:55,084 --> 01:17:57,383
I just -

871
01:17:58,984 --> 01:18:01,437
My only fr-

872
01:18:01,542 --> 01:18:04,222
My only friends in the -
in the world.

873
01:18:05,730 --> 01:18:09,949
I- I'm afraid I-
I'll never see 'em again.

874
01:18:12,892 --> 01:18:15,640
I feel - feel so -

875
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,570
Oh. Severed.

876
01:18:21,972 --> 01:18:24,011
Come with me.

877
01:18:24,115 --> 01:18:27,341
- Take me home.
- I can't go home.

878
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:29,347
I can't go home.

879
01:18:34,537 --> 01:18:36,422
Is that your typing machine there?

880
01:18:38,342 --> 01:18:43,127
Foutu.
Broken... beyond repair.

881
01:18:44,575 --> 01:18:47,291
If we fix the typing machine...

882
01:18:47,391 --> 01:18:49,844
we also fix the life.

883
01:19:08,395 --> 01:19:10,249
There. You see?

884
01:19:10,346 --> 01:19:12,832
There's no cause for despair.

885
01:19:12,937 --> 01:19:15,716
In this shop,
anything can be fixed that is broken.

886
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:49,255
I don't know, Kiki.

887
01:19:51,078 --> 01:19:54,175
They don't seem to be capable
of delicate work here.

888
01:19:54,276 --> 01:19:57,120
You must have faith, William.

889
01:19:58,176 --> 01:20:00,029
Look.

890
01:20:00,127 --> 01:20:01,981
We have your new writing machine.

891
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:39,260
Not bad. Not bad.
Not bad. Not bad.

892
01:20:39,324 --> 01:20:41,941
I feel very comfortable
working with you.

893
01:20:42,043 --> 01:20:45,836
I like that sense of camaraderie in an agent.

894
01:20:45,943 --> 01:20:48,243
You must be progressing.

895
01:20:48,341 --> 01:20:52,080
My predecessor felt you had
an ambivalent relationship with him.

896
01:20:54,576 --> 01:20:56,462
- You mean Clark Nova.
- Yes.

897
01:20:57,453 --> 01:20:59,426
How is he?

898
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:02,247
He's still in the hands of our enemies.

899
01:21:02,345 --> 01:21:04,579
Such are the hazards of our trade.

900
01:21:04,807 --> 01:21:06,714
A hazardous trade, yes.

901
01:21:08,324 --> 01:21:11,223
Your report on the subversive
activities ofJoan Frost...

902
01:21:11,329 --> 01:21:13,628
was a model of its type.

903
01:21:13,727 --> 01:21:16,888
If you continue to develop
your skills as an operative...

904
01:21:16,987 --> 01:21:21,076
I think a top position
with the C.I.A. is not out of reach.

905
01:21:22,456 --> 01:21:24,909
The C.I.A.?
You really think so?

906
01:21:25,014 --> 01:21:28,491
You have the demeanor.
That's something you can't buy.

907
01:21:30,289 --> 01:21:32,110
The C.I.A.

908
01:21:34,541 --> 01:21:36,775
The C.I.A.

909
01:21:39,944 --> 01:21:42,560
Now, that's a career
you can really sink your teeth into.

910
01:21:42,663 --> 01:21:44,515
It has...

911
01:21:46,083 --> 01:21:47,968
resonance.

912
01:21:49,216 --> 01:21:51,832
But giving yourself over
to being a writer-

913
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:56,055
Ah, well.

914
01:21:57,114 --> 01:22:00,013
This stuff is very potent.

915
01:22:00,119 --> 01:22:02,027
The two are very closely related.

916
01:22:02,293 --> 01:22:04,593
So you boys keep telling me.

917
01:22:05,778 --> 01:22:09,572
Well, what's my next assignment?

918
01:22:09,678 --> 01:22:12,065
I'm hungry for adventure.

919
01:22:12,173 --> 01:22:16,925
Excellent.
You know the Swiss dandy Cloquet?

920
01:22:17,033 --> 01:22:18,853
- Yes.
- And?

921
01:22:21,188 --> 01:22:24,534
I think he's a faggito and won't admit it.

922
01:22:24,642 --> 01:22:27,224
That ought to make it all easier.

923
01:22:27,294 --> 01:22:30,358
You will seduce
or otherwise compromise Cloquet.

924
01:22:30,461 --> 01:22:36,021
We have it on good authority
that he's our conduit to Benway.

925
01:22:36,121 --> 01:22:38,126
Dr. Benway, M.D., Ph.D.?

926
01:22:38,199 --> 01:22:42,667
Self-styled. He never actually
made it through medical school.

927
01:22:42,770 --> 01:22:46,695
He runs an interesting little show here
which he calls Interzone, Inc.

928
01:22:46,799 --> 01:22:48,619
Pretentious, if you ask me.

929
01:22:48,716 --> 01:22:50,820
Benway's behind Interzone, Inc.?

930
01:22:50,890 --> 01:22:54,237
The base of his pyramid
is a drug called the black meat.

931
01:22:54,312 --> 01:22:56,219
- The pyramid's tip -
- Is?

932
01:22:56,326 --> 01:22:58,495
Ah. Well, we'd like to know.

933
01:23:02,369 --> 01:23:04,254
Dr. Benway.

934
01:23:06,493 --> 01:23:08,727
- Of course.
- Yes.

935
01:23:08,827 --> 01:23:12,435
- Yes.
- And he's obviously got sensational cover.

936
01:23:12,535 --> 01:23:15,600
He's floated in and out
of the Zone for years...

937
01:23:15,703 --> 01:23:17,740
without anybody actually
ever seeing him.

938
01:23:18,004 --> 01:23:20,968
But now the pressure's on
to place an agent close to him.

939
01:23:21,073 --> 01:23:23,307
Me.

940
01:23:24,526 --> 01:23:26,629
Assessments are being made.

941
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:46,926
- You're working away, William?
- Yes, Kiki.

942
01:23:48,824 --> 01:23:52,912
The machine turns out
to be a very good one.

943
01:23:53,014 --> 01:23:55,118
Muy simpatico.

944
01:23:56,722 --> 01:23:59,305
And I have you to thank for it...

945
01:24:00,559 --> 01:24:02,444
and so I will.

946
01:24:02,541 --> 01:24:04,449
Thank you.

947
01:24:06,026 --> 01:24:08,741
I'm very proud
to be your friend, you know.

948
01:24:10,406 --> 01:24:13,273
I'm very proud
that I can help you to be a writer.

949
01:24:15,075 --> 01:24:18,039
You have done that, Kiki.
You really have.

950
01:24:28,629 --> 01:24:31,017
Would you like some tea?

951
01:24:31,092 --> 01:24:32,978
That would be lovely, William.

952
01:24:38,253 --> 01:24:40,107
Kiki.

953
01:24:40,205 --> 01:24:43,846
- Hmm?
- Do you know Cloquet?

954
01:24:44,905 --> 01:24:48,251
The Swiss man with the big house
on the Old Valley Road?

955
01:24:48,357 --> 01:24:50,177
Cloquet?

956
01:24:51,618 --> 01:24:55,096
Oh,yes,yes.
Yves with the wonderful car.

957
01:24:56,734 --> 01:24:58,586
He has a wonderful car?

958
01:25:00,665 --> 01:25:02,388
The most wonderful car.

959
01:25:10,514 --> 01:25:12,487
Enjoying the ride?

960
01:25:12,592 --> 01:25:15,241
I'm wild about it, yes.
Thank you.

961
01:25:15,342 --> 01:25:17,228
It's good to be wild sometimes.

962
01:25:19,690 --> 01:25:22,754
You know, I have often thought of
that funny story you told me...

963
01:25:22,856 --> 01:25:24,676
the first time we met on the beach.

964
01:25:24,773 --> 01:25:27,935
The one about the Duc de Ventre.

965
01:25:28,034 --> 01:25:32,155
At first I didn't know how to take it.

966
01:25:32,223 --> 01:25:35,090
I thought you were
making a pass at me.

967
01:25:37,977 --> 01:25:41,323
Did I ever tell you about the man
who taught his asshole to talk?

968
01:25:42,485 --> 01:25:46,606
His whole abdomen would move up and down,
you dig, farting out the words.

969
01:25:48,018 --> 01:25:49,903
It was unlike anything I ever heard.

970
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,845
Bubbly, thick, stagnant sound.

971
01:25:52,942 --> 01:25:55,329
A sound you could smell.

972
01:25:55,434 --> 01:25:57,408
This man worked for the carnival,you dig?

973
01:25:57,513 --> 01:26:00,380
And to start with it was
like a novelty ventriloquist act.

974
01:26:00,486 --> 01:26:02,818
After a while,
the ass started talking on its own.

975
01:26:02,916 --> 01:26:05,150
He would go in
without anything prepared...

976
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:09,044
and his ass would ad-lib
and toss the gags back at him every time.

977
01:26:10,686 --> 01:26:12,538
Then it developed sort of teethlike...

978
01:26:12,636 --> 01:26:16,691
little raspy incurving hooks
and started eating.

979
01:26:16,791 --> 01:26:19,506
He thought this was cute at first
and built an act around it...

980
01:26:19,573 --> 01:26:22,886
but the asshole would eat its way through
his pants and start talking on the street...

981
01:26:22,995 --> 01:26:25,328
shouting out it wanted equal rights.

982
01:26:25,425 --> 01:26:29,699
It would get drunk, too, and have crying jags.
Nobody loved it.

983
01:26:29,806 --> 01:26:33,186
And it wanted to be kissed,
same as any other mouth.

984
01:26:33,291 --> 01:26:35,428
Finally, it talked all the time,
day and night.

985
01:26:35,528 --> 01:26:39,648
You could hear him for blocks,
screaming at it to shut up...

986
01:26:39,749 --> 01:26:41,635
beating at it with his fists...

987
01:26:41,731 --> 01:26:43,671
and sticking candles up it, but...

988
01:26:45,024 --> 01:26:47,258
nothing did any good,
and the asshole said to him...

989
01:26:47,358 --> 01:26:50,073
"It is you who will shut up
in the end, not me...

990
01:26:50,171 --> 01:26:53,202
"because we don't need you
around here anymore.

991
01:26:53,305 --> 01:26:55,921
I can talk and eat and shit."

992
01:26:57,428 --> 01:27:01,254
After that, he began waking up
in the morning with transparentjelly...

993
01:27:01,362 --> 01:27:03,816
like a tadpole's tail
all over his mouth.

994
01:27:05,327 --> 01:27:08,673
He would tear it off his mouth
and the pieces would stick to his hands...

995
01:27:08,939 --> 01:27:13,310
like burning gasoline jelly
and grow there.

996
01:27:13,416 --> 01:27:16,609
So, finally, his mouth sealed over...

997
01:27:16,709 --> 01:27:18,563
and the whole head...

998
01:27:18,628 --> 01:27:21,821
would have amputated spontaneously
except for the eyes, you dig?

999
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,764
That's the one thing
that the asshole couldn't do was see.

1000
01:27:24,861 --> 01:27:27,412
It needed the eyes.

1001
01:27:27,514 --> 01:27:29,454
Nerve connections were blocked...

1002
01:27:29,561 --> 01:27:31,534
and infiltrated and atrophied.

1003
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:34,986
So, the brain couldn't
give orders anymore.

1004
01:27:35,092 --> 01:27:38,122
It was trapped inside the skull...

1005
01:27:38,193 --> 01:27:40,102
sealed off.

1006
01:27:41,967 --> 01:27:43,972
For a while, you could see...

1007
01:27:44,077 --> 01:27:48,807
the silent, helpless suffering
of the brain behind the eyes.

1008
01:27:51,335 --> 01:27:53,405
And then finally
the brain must have died...

1009
01:27:53,509 --> 01:27:55,330
because the eyes went out...

1010
01:27:56,418 --> 01:28:00,822
and there was no more feeling in them
than a crab's eye at the end of a stalk.

1011
01:28:13,587 --> 01:28:16,933
You seem to like my little friend.
I'm so glad.

1012
01:28:17,008 --> 01:28:20,780
I'm writing a business piece
on corporate life in North Africa.

1013
01:28:25,225 --> 01:28:27,078
Oh, my, my.

1014
01:28:27,143 --> 01:28:30,043
We are fragile today, aren't we?

1015
01:28:31,364 --> 01:28:33,305
He has to get to know you first.

1016
01:28:33,410 --> 01:28:36,702
Oh, does he?
Well, let's see what we can do, then.

1017
01:28:39,644 --> 01:28:41,880
Kiki, will you come
and see the parrots with me?

1018
01:28:41,978 --> 01:28:43,951
There are cages in the master bedroom.

1019
01:28:44,057 --> 01:28:47,185
I, um, don't think I can, Mr. Cloquet.

1020
01:28:47,254 --> 01:28:49,837
That is, I don't really want to.

1021
01:28:49,940 --> 01:28:53,766
I'd particularly like to interview
a certain Dr. Benway.

1022
01:28:55,950 --> 01:29:00,649
Kiki doesn't seem to find my parrots
attractive anymore. Isn't that sad?

1023
01:29:00,715 --> 01:29:03,679
Kiki would love to play
with your parrots, Yves...

1024
01:29:03,943 --> 01:29:08,860
but Kiki is as anxious to contact
this Benway character as I am.

1025
01:29:10,274 --> 01:29:13,620
Fadela, the witch
who works for the Frosts...

1026
01:29:13,695 --> 01:29:15,580
she and Benway are...

1027
01:29:15,677 --> 01:29:17,531
intimates.

1028
01:29:17,596 --> 01:29:19,830
You didn't hear it from me.

1029
01:29:19,930 --> 01:29:22,067
Kiki?

1030
01:29:24,789 --> 01:29:28,876
Go see the fucking parrots, will you, Kiki?
I gotta take a piss.

1031
01:29:31,247 --> 01:29:33,732
Then I'll come and get you,
and we'll go home.

1032
01:29:33,837 --> 01:29:35,940
Pissoir's at the end of the great hall.

1033
01:30:06,608 --> 01:30:08,549
Kiki.

1034
01:30:13,579 --> 01:30:15,465
Kiki.

1035
01:30:24,865 --> 01:30:26,870
Kiki.

1036
01:31:06,205 --> 01:31:08,853
Hello, Bill. What's up?

1037
01:31:11,161 --> 01:31:12,982
Something the matter?

1038
01:31:13,975 --> 01:31:16,275
You seem distracted.

1039
01:31:21,297 --> 01:31:24,141
I wish you'd say something.

1040
01:31:24,237 --> 01:31:26,471
I don't like this mood, Bill.

1041
01:31:26,731 --> 01:31:28,933
- Are we going out?
- You're going out.

1042
01:31:29,001 --> 01:31:32,611
Why don't you just write something
and calm yourself down?

1043
01:31:32,679 --> 01:31:35,839
You're obviously not
in a professional state of mind.

1044
01:31:35,908 --> 01:31:39,134
Maybe I should write about
your little double cross.

1045
01:31:39,233 --> 01:31:43,506
You expected me to end up
in that parrot cage with Cloquet, didn't you?

1046
01:31:43,613 --> 01:31:47,384
Bill, are you thinking
of getting rid of me?

1047
01:31:47,450 --> 01:31:52,562
I think an exchange of hostages
is the only viable scenario.

1048
01:31:52,661 --> 01:31:55,047
No, really, Bill, if you get rid of me...

1049
01:31:55,155 --> 01:31:57,096
you sever ties with reality.

1050
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:59,498
For instance, take the case of-

1051
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:01,485
Oh.! Careful.!

1052
01:32:01,582 --> 01:32:05,375
Of the female agent who forgot
her real identity and merged with her cover story.

1053
01:32:05,482 --> 01:32:09,024
She is still a fricoteuse in Annexia.

1054
01:32:09,127 --> 01:32:12,289
And incidentally,you can make a square,
heterosex citizen queer...

1055
01:32:12,388 --> 01:32:15,004
with this angle using drugs-

1056
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:18,527
Tom...

1057
01:32:18,623 --> 01:32:20,509
I've brought you a new typewriter...

1058
01:32:20,606 --> 01:32:23,504
which conveniently dispenses
two types of intoxicating fluids...

1059
01:32:23,578 --> 01:32:25,716
when it likes what you've written.

1060
01:32:27,671 --> 01:32:30,058
Are you proposing to trade back
for your Clark Nova?

1061
01:32:31,508 --> 01:32:33,328
Thinking of it.

1062
01:32:33,426 --> 01:32:35,280
Has it written
anything good for you lately?

1063
01:32:37,038 --> 01:32:41,061
No. It's too damned
all-American for my taste.

1064
01:32:41,163 --> 01:32:43,778
Guess I've gone foreign or something.

1065
01:32:45,287 --> 01:32:48,733
Well, my Mugwriter here
is so foreign, it's almost alien.

1066
01:32:48,836 --> 01:32:52,313
You're gonna do
your best work on her. Guaranteed.

1067
01:32:59,899 --> 01:33:04,401
Hafid, bring the machine
in question for Bill, will you?

1068
01:33:17,964 --> 01:33:20,198
And how are you enjoying
your affair with Joan?

1069
01:33:20,297 --> 01:33:23,807
Literate, complex and neurotic,
I would imagine.

1070
01:33:28,099 --> 01:33:30,007
I haven't seen her for weeks.

1071
01:33:31,296 --> 01:33:33,367
She ran off with Fadela and her coven.

1072
01:33:33,470 --> 01:33:35,355
Oh, that's too bad.

1073
01:33:37,562 --> 01:33:40,375
Yes, she does that
when she feels attracted to a man.

1074
01:33:42,390 --> 01:33:45,236
Don't give up though.
It's-It's a good sign.

1075
01:33:45,331 --> 01:33:47,271
With Joanie...

1076
01:33:47,538 --> 01:33:51,625
the courtship period can involve
years of passionate ambivalence.

1077
01:33:57,257 --> 01:34:01,115
Tom, I think we should
take a close look at his machine first...

1078
01:34:01,221 --> 01:34:03,108
test it thoroughly.

1079
01:34:03,204 --> 01:34:06,430
Don't you, Tom?

1080
01:34:06,529 --> 01:34:10,487
You both have different writing styles.

1081
01:34:10,590 --> 01:34:14,100
Bill Lee has always been a man
of powerful instinct, Hafid.

1082
01:34:15,577 --> 01:34:17,779
If he says I'll do
my best work on his machine...

1083
01:34:17,879 --> 01:34:19,733
well, I'm sure that's prophecy.

1084
01:34:24,722 --> 01:34:27,468
Take the gun, too, Bill.

1085
01:34:27,567 --> 01:34:32,265
No American should find himself
in a foreign land without a pistol.

1086
01:34:34,504 --> 01:34:37,371
You wouldn't be trying to set me up again,
now, would you, Tom?

1087
01:34:37,478 --> 01:34:41,184
Well, you've set yourself up already, Bill.

1088
01:34:41,251 --> 01:34:44,249
I'm just trying to give you
a fighting chance. That's all.

1089
01:35:02,768 --> 01:35:04,588
Clark Nova.

1090
01:35:04,686 --> 01:35:06,571
Clark Nova, it's me.

1091
01:35:07,628 --> 01:35:09,481
It's - It's Bill Lee.

1092
01:35:09,546 --> 01:35:13,797
Clark Nova, speak to me.
You're safe with me now.

1093
01:35:13,862 --> 01:35:15,749
They tortured me...

1094
01:35:15,813 --> 01:35:19,225
did unspeakable things to me.

1095
01:35:19,298 --> 01:35:22,459
I'm on my last legs.
The bastards.

1096
01:35:23,870 --> 01:35:26,715
Clark Nova, where is Joan?
Where's Joan?

1097
01:35:28,474 --> 01:35:31,155
Hans's old drug factory in the medina.

1098
01:35:32,471 --> 01:35:34,291
Fadela is there.

1099
01:35:34,389 --> 01:35:38,695
Fadela is your point of penetration
into Interzone, Inc.

1100
01:35:40,272 --> 01:35:42,213
Fadela.

1101
01:35:42,318 --> 01:35:44,901
Uh, what do I -
what do I do when I find her?

1102
01:35:44,971 --> 01:35:48,830
You'll know what to do
when the time comes.

1103
01:35:48,936 --> 01:35:51,203
Just remember this -

1104
01:35:51,270 --> 01:35:53,635
all agents defect...

1105
01:35:53,732 --> 01:35:56,283
and all resisters sell out.

1106
01:35:57,633 --> 01:35:59,934
That's the sad truth, Bill.

1107
01:36:00,031 --> 01:36:05,144
And a writer-
a writer lives the sad truth like anyone else.

1108
01:36:05,242 --> 01:36:07,891
The only difference is -

1109
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:09,845
he files a report on it.

1110
01:36:09,942 --> 01:36:12,842
Leave me now...

1111
01:36:12,948 --> 01:36:14,800
before it's too late.

1112
01:36:14,866 --> 01:36:17,035
But wait. What aboutJoan?
What aboutJoan?

1113
01:36:17,135 --> 01:36:21,540
Go now!
Vaya con dios.

1114
01:36:21,804 --> 01:36:25,063
Clark Nova. Clark Nova -

1115
01:37:40,679 --> 01:37:42,564
Hurry. Hurry.

1116
01:37:44,772 --> 01:37:46,624
Come on.

1117
01:37:55,419 --> 01:38:00,684
Your notes must be much more
carefully detailed to be of any use to us.

1118
01:38:00,790 --> 01:38:03,374
You must write very clearly.

1119
01:38:03,476 --> 01:38:06,702
The effects of the drugs
must be cataloged...

1120
01:38:06,801 --> 01:38:09,254
with painstaking accuracy.

1121
01:38:27,870 --> 01:38:29,844
-Joan.
- Hmm?

1122
01:38:29,948 --> 01:38:32,335
-Joan.
- Bill.

1123
01:38:34,330 --> 01:38:36,182
Oh, Bill.

1124
01:38:40,372 --> 01:38:42,410
No.

1125
01:38:42,674 --> 01:38:45,159
No.

1126
01:38:45,264 --> 01:38:48,043
What is that?
What are you writing?

1127
01:38:48,141 --> 01:38:50,921
I'm writing...

1128
01:38:51,018 --> 01:38:53,799
"All is lost.

1129
01:38:53,896 --> 01:38:55,716
All is lost."

1130
01:38:57,093 --> 01:38:59,164
- It's all I've ever written.
- No.

1131
01:39:04,031 --> 01:39:05,916
No.

1132
01:39:05,981 --> 01:39:07,835
Oh,Joan.

1133
01:39:08,826 --> 01:39:10,679
We have to see Fadela.

1134
01:39:11,705 --> 01:39:13,558
Take me to Fadela.

1135
01:39:33,477 --> 01:39:36,509
Lee, you're here.

1136
01:39:36,611 --> 01:39:38,616
Oh, thank God. Thank God.

1137
01:39:38,721 --> 01:39:42,775
You see, my misdemeanor
has borne sweet fruit.

1138
01:39:43,037 --> 01:39:44,945
Now you are with us.

1139
01:39:45,052 --> 01:39:48,910
I was right to approach you so brazenly.

1140
01:39:49,015 --> 01:39:52,591
And now Dr. Benway will have no choice -

1141
01:39:52,693 --> 01:39:55,822
- Benway.
- Benway.

1142
01:39:55,890 --> 01:39:57,776
No choice but to send me back-

1143
01:39:57,873 --> 01:40:00,717
- You'll see.
- Benway.

1144
01:40:00,814 --> 01:40:02,668
Where I belong.

1145
01:40:12,196 --> 01:40:14,267
Well, well.

1146
01:40:14,370 --> 01:40:17,215
If it isn't William Lee.

1147
01:40:23,930 --> 01:40:26,164
I got to say I'm proud of you, sir.

1148
01:40:26,263 --> 01:40:28,629
It took you a while,
but you got us red-handed.

1149
01:40:28,727 --> 01:40:30,547
Full marks, boy.
Full marks.

1150
01:40:33,906 --> 01:40:37,252
I expected to see an operation
all out for the black meat here.

1151
01:40:37,359 --> 01:40:39,746
What's with all the Mugwump jism?

1152
01:40:41,770 --> 01:40:43,710
The black meat concession
turns out to have...

1153
01:40:43,817 --> 01:40:47,294
some unfortunate
political strings attached.

1154
01:40:47,398 --> 01:40:49,219
We'vejust cut those strings.

1155
01:40:49,317 --> 01:40:54,014
From now on,
Interzone is strictly Mugwump territory.

1156
01:40:54,112 --> 01:40:58,451
As you can see, we've made
a flying start here with our modest dispensary.

1157
01:40:59,515 --> 01:41:01,902
I can feel the heat
closing in on you, Fadela.

1158
01:41:03,544 --> 01:41:05,997
Feel them out there
making their moves,you dig?

1159
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:08,521
Oh, really?

1160
01:41:08,595 --> 01:41:10,667
Fadela. Huh.

1161
01:41:10,770 --> 01:41:14,280
Huh.

1162
01:41:14,383 --> 01:41:16,268
You mean this old thing.

1163
01:41:28,162 --> 01:41:30,462
- Benway!
- Benway!

1164
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:32,566
Benway.!

1165
01:41:32,670 --> 01:41:34,675
We met once before, remember? Stateside.

1166
01:41:38,010 --> 01:41:40,854
You don't remember.
You had that look, boy.

1167
01:41:42,357 --> 01:41:45,389
The look of a...
sheep-killing dog.

1168
01:41:46,387 --> 01:41:48,873
Decided to recruit you
right on the spot.

1169
01:41:48,976 --> 01:41:51,592
I'm afraid I was forced
by the tenor of the times...

1170
01:41:51,694 --> 01:41:54,441
to prescribe that wretched
black meat powder to start you off on...

1171
01:41:54,507 --> 01:41:58,627
but the hole-in-the-wall operation,
limited resources -

1172
01:41:58,695 --> 01:42:00,549
you understand the problems.

1173
01:42:01,702 --> 01:42:05,975
But I understand from Cloquet
that, uh, you're on to our good stuff now.

1174
01:42:07,328 --> 01:42:09,715
Mugwump jism can't be beat.

1175
01:42:09,822 --> 01:42:14,422
And as you can see,
we've got ourselves a few more friends now.

1176
01:42:15,993 --> 01:42:18,479
And a few more dollars, too.

1177
01:42:19,701 --> 01:42:21,554
Oh.

1178
01:42:21,652 --> 01:42:24,998
This little, uh, Fadela number
is something I developed...

1179
01:42:25,105 --> 01:42:28,844
during my tenure as chief physician
to the prime minister of Annexia.

1180
01:42:28,942 --> 01:42:33,280
"El Primo" liked to walk the streets
amongst his people in drag, and, well -

1181
01:42:33,386 --> 01:42:36,034
Well...

1182
01:42:36,136 --> 01:42:38,501
one thing led to another.

1183
01:42:42,018 --> 01:42:45,812
It is an elegant way to strike terror
into the hearts of the enemy...

1184
01:42:46,078 --> 01:42:47,932
wouldn't you say?

1185
01:42:48,029 --> 01:42:50,416
Old Fadela must be on the rag.

1186
01:42:52,025 --> 01:42:54,031
She's been acting subversive lately.

1187
01:42:56,852 --> 01:42:59,239
Speaking of new uses
for old technology...

1188
01:43:00,466 --> 01:43:04,293
I think the new order could find
a place for a man of your caliber.

1189
01:43:04,399 --> 01:43:06,285
A .3 2, wasn't it?

1190
01:43:07,596 --> 01:43:09,799
That is what you're here for, isn't it?

1191
01:43:10,058 --> 01:43:12,097
Hell...

1192
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:14,271
I could use a reliable man
to send to Annexia.

1193
01:43:14,374 --> 01:43:17,851
We're expanding, boy.
I need a... spearhead.

1194
01:43:19,649 --> 01:43:21,536
Just tell me what you want.

1195
01:43:23,454 --> 01:43:25,111
I want her.

1196
01:43:28,218 --> 01:43:30,288
Her?

1197
01:43:32,471 --> 01:43:34,574
That purulent little cunt?
What for?

1198
01:43:36,402 --> 01:43:38,256
I can't write without her.

1199
01:43:42,862 --> 01:43:45,925
Bill, I feel confident...

1200
01:43:46,027 --> 01:43:48,545
that you and I can
work something out.

1201
01:44:20,461 --> 01:44:22,282
Papers, please.

1202
01:44:22,380 --> 01:44:24,200
What is the purpose of your visit...

1203
01:44:24,298 --> 01:44:26,150
and what is your profession?

1204
01:44:26,248 --> 01:44:28,189
I write reports. I'm a writer...

1205
01:44:28,295 --> 01:44:32,382
and I intend to write reports on life
in Annexia for the citizens of the U.S.A.

1206
01:44:32,482 --> 01:44:34,455
Do you have any proof of what you say?

1207
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,632
How do we know
you are really a writer?

1208
01:44:38,493 --> 01:44:40,378
Well, I have a writing device.

1209
01:44:40,443 --> 01:44:42,132
That's not good enough.

1210
01:44:43,225 --> 01:44:45,111
Show us.

1211
01:44:46,102 --> 01:44:48,075
- Show you.
- Write something.

1212
01:44:53,552 --> 01:44:55,438
- Write something.
- Yes.

1213
01:44:56,526 --> 01:44:58,412
Write something.

1214
01:45:13,151 --> 01:45:15,702
Joan.

1215
01:45:15,805 --> 01:45:17,691
Joan.

1216
01:45:21,496 --> 01:45:24,689
What is it, Bill?
Are we there yet?

1217
01:45:26,227 --> 01:45:28,135
Almost,Joan.

1218
01:45:30,479 --> 01:45:33,477
But I guess it's about time
for our William Tell routine.

1219
01:45:35,085 --> 01:45:36,970
Sure, Bill.

1220
01:46:27,807 --> 01:46:30,707
Welcome... to Annexia.

1221
01:46:31,771 --> 01:46:34,616
Yes. Welcome to Annexia.
