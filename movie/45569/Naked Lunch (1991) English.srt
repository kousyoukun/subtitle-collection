1
00:03:06,656 --> 00:03:08,616
Exterminator.

2
00:03:45,447 --> 00:03:47,324
Mm-hmm.

3
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,952
You want I should spit right in your face?

4
00:03:49,952 --> 00:03:52,413
You want, hmm?
You want? You want?

5
00:03:52,538 --> 00:03:54,415
I ran out.

6
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,418
You ran out?
Oh, that's nice.

7
00:03:57,543 --> 00:04:00,546
You ran out.
It's impossible you run out!

8
00:04:00,546 --> 00:04:02,590
What'd you do, eat the stuff?

9
00:04:02,673 --> 00:04:04,593
The Chink shortchanged me.

10
00:04:04,676 --> 00:04:06,929
No "glot." Come "Fliday."

11
00:04:12,017 --> 00:04:16,105
It's funny.
It's actual very funny what you just said.

12
00:04:16,105 --> 00:04:18,023
Ran out.

13
00:04:18,148 --> 00:04:22,695
You can either paint it, or draw it, or write
it down, right, and then pass it on to somebody.

14
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:25,615
They read what you're saying,
and then they reexperience.

15
00:04:25,657 --> 00:04:27,784
And that's the only connection
you have with that man.

16
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:29,953
So you can't rewrite...

17
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,872
'cause to rewrite is to deceive and lie...

18
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,791
and you betray your own thoughts.

19
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:39,422
To rethink the flow and the rhythm
and the tumbling out of the words...

20
00:04:39,422 --> 00:04:41,132
is a betrayal.

21
00:04:41,424 --> 00:04:43,801
And it's a sin, Martin.
It's a sin.

22
00:04:43,926 --> 00:04:45,886
I don't accept your, uh...

23
00:04:46,011 --> 00:04:49,181
Catholic interpretation
of my compulsive, uh...

24
00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:54,062
necessity to rewrite
every single word at least a hundred times.

25
00:04:54,062 --> 00:04:57,649
Guilt is -Thanks.
Guilt is the key, not sin.

26
00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:00,736
Guilt re not writing
the best that I can.

27
00:05:00,736 --> 00:05:04,865
Guilt re not, uh, considering everything
from every possible angle.

28
00:05:04,865 --> 00:05:06,825
Balancing everything.

29
00:05:06,908 --> 00:05:12,123
Well, how about guilt
re censoring your best thoughts?

30
00:05:12,123 --> 00:05:15,084
Your most honest,
primitive, real thoughts...

31
00:05:15,084 --> 00:05:18,963
because that's what your laborious
rewriting amounts to, Martin.

32
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:21,632
Is rewriting really censorship, Bill?

33
00:05:21,758 --> 00:05:24,802
Because I'm completely fucked if it is.

34
00:05:24,886 --> 00:05:28,057
Exterminate all rational thought.

35
00:05:28,182 --> 00:05:30,350
That is the conclusion I have come to.

36
00:05:30,476 --> 00:05:33,687
What is the man talking about?
I'm being serious.

37
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:35,606
So is he.

38
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:41,780
So how is the extermination business
going there, Bill?

39
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:45,825
Somebody's stealing my roach powder.
Somebody's got it in for me.

40
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:48,787
Hmm. Well, Bill,
maybe you should take it as a sign.

41
00:05:48,787 --> 00:05:51,372
Maybe you ought to try your hand
at writing pornography.

42
00:05:51,372 --> 00:05:54,834
Yeah, a novel a week at 120 bucks.
It's serious money.

43
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:56,753
I can connect you with the guy.

44
00:05:56,836 --> 00:05:59,882
We're thinking of
collaborating on one ourselves.

45
00:05:59,882 --> 00:06:01,967
I gave up writing when I was ten.

46
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:06,764
- Too dangerous.
- Only if someone reads what you write.

47
00:06:06,764 --> 00:06:09,141
So far we haven't had that problem.

48
00:06:09,392 --> 00:06:11,519
I've found my profession.
I'm an exterminator.

49
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,564
Of course, Bill. That's just
what the world needs...

50
00:06:14,606 --> 00:06:18,235
- ...more literate exterminators.
- Give me a cigarette.

51
00:06:21,196 --> 00:06:23,865
Of course, then, you know...

52
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:27,494
you're gonna have trouble
if you can't keep track of your roach powder.

53
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:38,506
Wait a minute.
Do you boys know something about this?

54
00:06:38,506 --> 00:06:40,466
We don't exactly know anything.

55
00:06:40,591 --> 00:06:43,970
No, but we suspect
it's a domestic problem.

56
00:07:18,173 --> 00:07:21,719
- My God, what are you doing?
- You weren't supposed to see this.

57
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:25,765
Well, now that I'm seeing it, what is it?

58
00:07:26,515 --> 00:07:28,476
I'm shooting up your bug powder.

59
00:07:29,477 --> 00:07:32,021
You might like to try it yourself.

60
00:07:32,146 --> 00:07:34,023
Or you might not.

61
00:07:34,148 --> 00:07:37,611
I ran out in the middle of a job.

62
00:07:40,655 --> 00:07:42,824
You gotta stop using the stuff,Joan.

63
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:45,452
They ration it out like snakebite serum.

64
00:07:45,577 --> 00:07:47,621
Well,just do what everybody else does -

65
00:07:47,746 --> 00:07:50,123
cut it with baby laxative.

66
00:07:50,373 --> 00:07:52,919
The roaches will
shit themselves to death.

67
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,089
It's the best job I ever had.

68
00:07:56,172 --> 00:07:58,424
If I run out again, I'm finished.

69
00:08:00,676 --> 00:08:02,637
Hmm.

70
00:08:04,347 --> 00:08:06,099
It's, um -

71
00:08:09,144 --> 00:08:11,522
It's a very literary high.

72
00:08:11,647 --> 00:08:13,607
Very literary.

73
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,943
Is that why Hank and Martin
know all about it?

74
00:08:15,943 --> 00:08:18,362
No, we just, uh -

75
00:08:18,487 --> 00:08:21,490
We all just tried it together-
spur of the moment thing.

76
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,575
They didn't like it, I did.

77
00:08:25,745 --> 00:08:27,956
What do you mean,
it's a literary high?

78
00:08:29,624 --> 00:08:31,543
It's a Kafka high.

79
00:08:31,626 --> 00:08:33,711
You feel like a bug.

80
00:08:36,214 --> 00:08:38,091
Try some.

81
00:08:41,595 --> 00:08:43,556
Well, I don't know.

82
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,853
I don't know.

83
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:56,610
- I think our metabolisms are very different.
- Whose?

84
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,572
Yours and Kafka's?

85
00:08:59,948 --> 00:09:03,285
I thought you were finished
with doing weird stuff.

86
00:09:04,453 --> 00:09:08,415
I thought I was, too,
but I guess I'm not.

87
00:09:13,503 --> 00:09:15,965
Personally...

88
00:09:16,048 --> 00:09:19,343
I prefer a pyrethrum job to a fluoride.

89
00:09:19,427 --> 00:09:21,345
With the pyrethrum...

90
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:24,390
you kill the roaches right there
in front of God and the client...

91
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,517
whereas this starch and fluoride-

92
00:09:26,601 --> 00:09:28,895
leave it around,
the roaches eat it...

93
00:09:28,978 --> 00:09:32,441
come back a few days later,
they're running around fat as hogs.

94
00:09:34,485 --> 00:09:37,571
And there it is, Bill.
You want to put on some weight...

95
00:09:37,571 --> 00:09:41,450
you gotta switch
from that yellow powder diet of yours...

96
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,495
to some of this good
fluoride stuff right here.

97
00:09:45,162 --> 00:09:47,916
Sure works for the Chink.
He's healthy enough.

98
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,918
You see him scarfthat poison down?

99
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:53,588
He doesn't really eat it.

100
00:09:53,713 --> 00:09:55,632
It's sleight of hand.

101
00:09:55,715 --> 00:09:59,844
The hell he doesn't. Been breathing in the
powder so long, it just makes him laugh.

102
00:09:59,844 --> 00:10:03,682
Just like them roaches.

103
00:10:15,611 --> 00:10:17,571
William Lee.

104
00:10:21,493 --> 00:10:24,579
- What is this?
- He's Hauser. I'm O'Brien.

105
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:27,082
City Narcotics.
We're gonna take you downtown, Bill.

106
00:10:27,082 --> 00:10:31,002
Little matter of possession
of a dangerous substance.

107
00:10:37,802 --> 00:10:40,138
You've got quite a record, Bill.

108
00:10:40,388 --> 00:10:43,099
A lot of drugs poured down the old vein.

109
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:46,811
I was a troubled person then.
I'm married now.

110
00:10:46,811 --> 00:10:48,688
Straight. Got a good job.

111
00:10:48,813 --> 00:10:51,483
That's good, Bill.
That's nice.

112
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:56,613
- What's this, then?
- That's my job.

113
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:58,615
I use it to kill bugs.

114
00:10:58,657 --> 00:11:01,785
- He says it kills bugs.
- He could be right.

115
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:04,121
- I'd like to see it.
- Me, too.

116
00:11:04,371 --> 00:11:07,374
- I'd like to see it, too.
- Well, gee.

117
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:13,423
I'd like to demonstrate, but I already
got rid of that last case of crabs I had.

118
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,593
Very funny, Bill.

119
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,638
But, you know...

120
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:23,016
I think we got a bug
around here somewhere.

121
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,561
You're right.

122
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:29,398
Let's see
if that yellow stuff will kill it.

123
00:12:22,371 --> 00:12:26,792
We'll be back later
to see how it worked out, kiddo.

124
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,630
Yeah.

125
00:12:30,713 --> 00:12:32,715
Break a leg.

126
00:12:36,845 --> 00:12:40,056
William Lee?

127
00:12:40,181 --> 00:12:44,477
I have arranged all this
just to have a moment alone with you.

128
00:12:44,477 --> 00:12:46,856
I am your case officer.

129
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,068
- Uh, my what?
- Case officer.

130
00:12:51,193 --> 00:12:53,404
You are my agent.

131
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:56,741
I, in turn, report to your controller.

132
00:12:56,866 --> 00:13:01,746
Come, come, Mr. Lee.
You don't have to play dumb with me.

133
00:13:01,746 --> 00:13:04,666
Oh. No. Well...

134
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,711
that would be foolish, wouldn't it?

135
00:13:07,794 --> 00:13:10,422
It would. Say, Bill...

136
00:13:11,506 --> 00:13:16,261
do you think you could rub
some of this powder on my lips?

137
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:19,849
Uh, yeah.

138
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,893
Sure.

139
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,155
Well, now.

140
00:13:35,657 --> 00:13:37,576
As you might have expected...

141
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:42,873
I have instructions
for you from Control.

142
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,878
It's about the little woman.

143
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,967
- The what?
- The little woman.

144
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:55,053
Your little woman.

145
00:13:55,136 --> 00:13:58,848
- Your wife.
- Tell me.

146
00:14:00,016 --> 00:14:03,061
Your wife is not really your wife.

147
00:14:03,144 --> 00:14:07,191
She is an agent
of Interzone Incorporated.

148
00:14:07,191 --> 00:14:09,151
You must kill her.

149
00:14:09,443 --> 00:14:11,112
KillJoan Lee.

150
00:14:11,404 --> 00:14:14,824
It must be done soon-
this week.

151
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:18,786
And it must be done real tasty.

152
00:14:18,828 --> 00:14:20,955
Interzone Incorporated?

153
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,708
An organization based in Interzone...

154
00:14:23,834 --> 00:14:28,422
a notorious free port
on the North African coast.

155
00:14:28,422 --> 00:14:31,842
A haven for
the mongrel scum of the Earth...

156
00:14:31,842 --> 00:14:36,012
an engorged parasite
on the underbelly of the West.

157
00:14:36,012 --> 00:14:38,682
Ah, I can't see it.

158
00:14:38,807 --> 00:14:41,185
Why would a classy
American woman likeJoan...

159
00:14:41,185 --> 00:14:45,857
ever want to work for a two-bit outfit
like Interzone Incorporated?

160
00:14:45,857 --> 00:14:48,651
But who says Joan Lee
is really a woman?

161
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:52,905
In fact, who says she's human at all?

162
00:14:54,115 --> 00:14:58,787
- What do you mean by that?
- I can say no more.

163
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:05,502
Hey, where you going?

164
00:15:05,586 --> 00:15:08,255
Don't do it. Don't do it.
There'll be hell to pay.

165
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,950
We've been made.
We gotta get out of town.

166
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,952
Wait a minute.

167
00:16:17,412 --> 00:16:20,958
- What's going on?
- I got busted for bug powder.

168
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,461
I started
hallucinating behind the stuff.

169
00:16:25,462 --> 00:16:29,174
God knows what I really said
to those two flatfeet.

170
00:16:29,174 --> 00:16:32,594
I'm not even sure
how I got out of there.

171
00:16:32,636 --> 00:16:35,849
Did you bring back
tomorrow's bug powder?

172
00:16:35,849 --> 00:16:37,684
Did you, Bill?
Did you?

173
00:16:40,145 --> 00:16:44,107
My God, Joan.
You're acting like a full-fledged junkie.

174
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:47,610
And it's bug powder,
for Christ's sake!

175
00:16:49,821 --> 00:16:51,782
Oh.

176
00:17:03,753 --> 00:17:07,132
I do have a little bit of a habit, yes, hon.

177
00:17:07,132 --> 00:17:11,011
You ought to at least give me
a few marks for originality.

178
00:17:11,011 --> 00:17:14,264
How did you know
it just wouldn't kill you?

179
00:17:15,766 --> 00:17:17,684
I don't know, Bill.

180
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,564
I felt drawn to it.

181
00:17:22,647 --> 00:17:24,859
You know?

182
00:17:24,984 --> 00:17:29,614
Like you feel drawn...to an old lover.

183
00:17:32,784 --> 00:17:35,453
Say, Bill...

184
00:17:35,495 --> 00:17:38,915
could you rub
some of this powder on my lips?

185
00:17:41,376 --> 00:17:43,921
Could you, Bill?

186
00:17:45,672 --> 00:17:47,633
Please?

187
00:18:39,896 --> 00:18:42,065
Hey!

188
00:18:43,608 --> 00:18:46,904
Bill.

189
00:18:49,574 --> 00:18:51,534
Hey, where were you this morning?

190
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:53,578
We missed you at the Automat.

191
00:18:54,704 --> 00:18:57,039
I, uh, got in a bit of a jam.

192
00:18:57,123 --> 00:19:00,543
I misplaced the gear,
in a manner of speaking.

193
00:19:00,543 --> 00:19:02,921
Yeah.
We heard about it.

194
00:19:03,046 --> 00:19:07,259
We saw you go off with the heat, in fact.

195
00:19:07,926 --> 00:19:10,429
They won't give it back to Cohen.

196
00:19:10,512 --> 00:19:12,431
It's evidence, they say.

197
00:19:12,514 --> 00:19:16,435
Yeah. It's an embarrassment, yes.

198
00:19:18,188 --> 00:19:21,024
Is that why you tried to lift mine?

199
00:19:23,526 --> 00:19:25,737
That's unkind, Edward.

200
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,573
"Lift" is unkind.

201
00:19:30,116 --> 00:19:33,412
I'm doing a job for a friend.

202
00:19:34,455 --> 00:19:39,627
The centipedes, Edward.
The centipedes are getting downright arrogant.

203
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:41,670
They're starting to attack his children.

204
00:19:41,796 --> 00:19:44,590
Take it from me, Bill.

205
00:19:44,673 --> 00:19:48,511
You're not the first one
to develop a bug powder problem.

206
00:19:48,511 --> 00:19:50,597
See this man.

207
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,558
He'll help ya.

208
00:19:53,642 --> 00:19:56,895
"Dr. A. Benway...

209
00:19:56,978 --> 00:19:59,606
General Practitioner."

210
00:20:00,774 --> 00:20:02,651
Bug powder?

211
00:20:03,693 --> 00:20:05,905
- You mean, uh, pyrethrum?
- Yes.

212
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:11,494
Hmm. I get a lot of you folks
in the extermination trade.

213
00:20:12,453 --> 00:20:15,832
You better help this friend of yours
get off the yellow stuff.

214
00:20:15,832 --> 00:20:19,836
- It'll kill him.
- How do I get him to kick?

215
00:20:20,461 --> 00:20:23,715
- Kick?
- H-How do I get him off it?

216
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:25,801
Oh.

217
00:20:27,511 --> 00:20:29,430
Mix it with this.

218
00:20:30,472 --> 00:20:34,059
Gradually increase the percentage
of black without telling your friend...

219
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:37,187
and he'll lose his taste
for the bug powder soon enough.

220
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,697
What is it?
What does it do?

221
00:20:45,822 --> 00:20:48,992
Oh, it's all natural.
It's made from, uh...

222
00:20:48,992 --> 00:20:52,829
aquatic Brazilian centipede
or some such outlandish thing.

223
00:20:52,829 --> 00:20:57,168
It shuts down the brain's
response to the bug powder. That's all.

224
00:20:57,168 --> 00:20:59,420
The powder becomes
irrelevant to the addict...

225
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,006
and the addict then
ceases to be addicted.

226
00:21:02,006 --> 00:21:04,675
Side effects?

227
00:21:05,885 --> 00:21:07,803
Nothing that will surprise the addict.

228
00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:12,392
But, uh, before I -
before I do your cure...

229
00:21:12,392 --> 00:21:14,352
I've gotta score some bug powder.

230
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:17,564
Score?

231
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:22,027
You're not trying to... pull a fast one
on the old doctor, are you?

232
00:21:22,027 --> 00:21:23,945
I came here for help.

233
00:21:25,489 --> 00:21:27,492
Of course you did.

234
00:21:31,704 --> 00:21:33,664
Phew!

235
00:21:33,706 --> 00:21:35,666
My God.

236
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:39,670
It smells like a... tainted cheese.

237
00:21:42,173 --> 00:21:45,052
You'll see how elegantly this works.

238
00:21:46,804 --> 00:21:48,764
The black will disappear completely.

239
00:21:57,481 --> 00:22:00,401
And there'll be no smell,
no discoloration.

240
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,404
It's like an agent -

241
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,199
an agent who's come to believe
his own cover story...

242
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:09,160
but who's in there, hiding...

243
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,788
in a larval state...

244
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:15,250
just waiting
for the proper moment to hatch out.

245
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,891
Extra, extra! Read all about it!

246
00:22:52,957 --> 00:22:55,168
Thirty-nine cents,just for today! Special.

247
00:22:55,168 --> 00:22:57,462
Thirty-nine cents.
Fresh cabbage.

248
00:23:11,852 --> 00:23:14,146
Centipedes.

249
00:23:44,136 --> 00:23:48,599
"Followers of obsolete,
unthinkable trades...

262
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:34,565
Hi, Bill.

263
00:24:36,066 --> 00:24:38,152
Say, why don't you and I join them?

264
00:25:16,526 --> 00:25:19,529
Hank and I were just bored.
It wasn't serious.

265
00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:21,448
I didn't take it seriously.

266
00:25:21,531 --> 00:25:23,533
Where is Hank?

267
00:25:23,617 --> 00:25:25,786
He got embarrassed and left.

268
00:25:27,037 --> 00:25:28,997
Not before he came, I hope.

269
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,583
Hank's on junk.
He doesn't come.

270
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:35,713
Not before you came, I hope.

271
00:25:35,755 --> 00:25:39,675
I'm on bug powder.
I don't need to come.

272
00:25:39,675 --> 00:25:44,472
"Officials of unconstituted police states...

273

278
00:26:05,161 --> 00:26:09,582
I guess it's about time
for our William Tell routine.

279
00:26:48,498 --> 00:26:50,459
Oh, God.

280
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,461
Oh, God.

281
00:26:56,507 --> 00:26:58,551
Joan.

282
00:26:58,676 --> 00:27:00,636
Joan.

283
00:27:03,681 --> 00:27:05,683
Oh,Joan.

284
00:27:46,936 --> 00:27:49,647
Are you a faggot?

285
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,782
Not by nature, no.

286
00:27:58,865 --> 00:28:00,867
I'm not.

287
00:28:02,077 --> 00:28:05,122
I wouldn't say... faggot.

288
00:28:05,372 --> 00:28:07,374
No.

289
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:14,506
However, circumstances have forced me
to consider the possibility that -

290
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:20,513
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.

291
00:28:20,638 --> 00:28:22,890
He specializes in sexual ambivalence.

292
00:28:25,101 --> 00:28:27,061
Sexual ambulance, did you say?

293
00:28:33,485 --> 00:28:35,404
My God.

294
00:28:35,529 --> 00:28:37,406
He's called Mugwump.

295
00:28:41,493 --> 00:28:43,620
No point in feigning surprise.

296
00:28:43,704 --> 00:28:46,832
You knew we would be
getting in touch with you.

297
00:28:46,832 --> 00:28:51,004
Why else would you come
to a waterfront dive like this?

298
00:28:51,713 --> 00:28:53,590
Why else?

299
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:56,718
I suggest a Clark Nova portable.

300
00:28:56,843 --> 00:28:59,179
It has mythic resonance.

301
00:28:59,429 --> 00:29:02,974
Clark Nova. A typewriter?
You suggest it for what?

302
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:06,479
For your report
from Interzone, of course.

303
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:09,940
Handwriting is not
considered professional.

304
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,901
Interzone.

305
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:14,945
My report.

306
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:19,116
And don't leave out
any of the tasty details -

307
00:29:19,116 --> 00:29:21,620
the small red hole in the forehead...

308
00:29:21,745 --> 00:29:23,622
or...

309
00:29:23,747 --> 00:29:26,166
the look of astonishment on her face.

310
00:29:28,502 --> 00:29:32,631
Listen to me.
You'rejust gonna have to leave town...

311
00:29:32,631 --> 00:29:34,549
and Interzone is the only place...

312
00:29:34,633 --> 00:29:38,137
that'll have a shady character
like you at such short notice.

313
00:29:38,137 --> 00:29:40,097
Take this.

314
00:29:40,139 --> 00:29:43,100
Take what?
What is that?

315
00:29:43,184 --> 00:29:45,645
Your ticket to Interzone.

316
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:48,064
Tourist class, I'm afraid...

317
00:29:48,147 --> 00:29:50,983
but what can you expect these days?

318
00:29:52,485 --> 00:29:54,863
We'll contact you there.

319
00:30:30,025 --> 00:30:32,528
Hmm. It's commie trash.

320
00:30:33,654 --> 00:30:35,656
And it's been fired very recently.

321
00:30:35,781 --> 00:30:37,867
You use it in a holdup?

322
00:30:39,827 --> 00:30:43,540
I want that typewriter in the window.
I want the portable.

323
00:30:47,752 --> 00:30:49,754
This plus...

324
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,840
$8.00.

325
00:30:53,175 --> 00:30:55,552
You got any ammo to go with it?

326
00:31:01,017 --> 00:31:02,977
These'll cover the state tax.

327
00:31:12,487 --> 00:31:14,907
- Bill.
- Martin.

328
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:20,662
Listen, Bill, I told the police it
was a drunken accident, that I saw it.

329
00:31:20,662 --> 00:31:23,165
So at least that's on the record.
They're after you though.

330
00:31:23,165 --> 00:31:25,918
They're saying that,
you escaped from custody...

331
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:29,755
and murdered your wife,
and-and they want you.

332
00:31:31,549 --> 00:31:33,968
I'd better lie low till my ship sails.

333
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:37,639
- You booked passage somewhere already?
- Sure. Look.

334
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:40,058
Got my ticket.

335
00:31:40,183 --> 00:31:43,394
Put this away,
for God's sake, Bill.

336
00:31:43,478 --> 00:31:45,897
- I'll send you a report.
- You'll send me a report?

337
00:31:45,897 --> 00:31:49,068
Well, I'll send you
a copy of the report.

338
00:31:49,068 --> 00:31:51,737
Are you gonna be all right?

339
00:31:53,656 --> 00:31:56,200
I hear Interzone's really nice
this time of year.

340
00:32:50,924 --> 00:32:53,052
He woke up in bed...

341
00:32:53,136 --> 00:32:55,847
to find himself wedged...

342
00:32:55,972 --> 00:32:57,891
between a Dutch transvestite...

343
00:32:57,974 --> 00:33:01,603
and six Arab men.

344
00:33:02,937 --> 00:33:04,856
Clark Nova.

345
00:33:05,982 --> 00:33:08,109
Very nice for writing reports.

346
00:33:10,821 --> 00:33:14,658
I use a Krups Dominator myself.

347
00:33:16,785 --> 00:33:18,996
Company policy.

348
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:30,467
You're American, correct?

349
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,805
You know Dr. Benway?

350
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,727
I am interested in selling...

351
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,855
a large stash of the black meat.

352
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,857
Verstehen Sie?

353
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:47,735
The sun-dried, powdered black meat...

354
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:52,740
of the giant
aquatic Brazilian centipede.

355
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,700
And...

356
00:33:55,952 --> 00:33:58,914
for some reason...

357
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:04,586
I am certain that you are working
for Herr Dr. Benway.

358
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:09,842
I'm - I-I-I'm sorry.

359
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:12,427
I apparently mistook you
for somebody else.

360
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:16,015
But as it happens, Mr. Lee,
I am, among other things...

361
00:34:16,015 --> 00:34:19,519
a provider of rare services to the arts...

362
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:24,566
and in my experience as a provider
of rare services to the arts...

363
00:34:24,566 --> 00:34:28,236
I have found that writers
are a-a particularly needy group.

364
00:34:29,028 --> 00:34:32,616
Is there nothing
I can provide for you...

365
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,202
Mr. Lee?

366
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,779
A very professional...

367
00:35:08,905 --> 00:35:10,781
operation...

368
00:35:11,908 --> 00:35:13,910
as you can see, Mr. Lee.

369
00:35:16,537 --> 00:35:18,414
You like a taste?

370
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:23,879
I'd be happy to join you in a taste,
if you're planning to have one.

371
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:46,820
You can understand
that if you were...

372
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:51,533
a purchasing agent
for a foreign power...

373
00:35:51,533 --> 00:35:54,495
how it would be
to my advantage...

374
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,998
to impress you with the cleanliness...

375
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,960
and the sincerity...

376
00:36:01,043 --> 00:36:03,087
of our operation.

377
00:36:05,506 --> 00:36:08,927
- You, uh, mentioned a Dr. -
- Benway.

378
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:11,638
- Benway.
- Benway. Correct.

379
00:36:11,763 --> 00:36:13,682
Yes.

380
00:36:14,808 --> 00:36:16,726
Does he qualify as a foreign power?

381
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:20,772
Oh, but yes!
He's very foreign.

382
00:36:32,201 --> 00:36:34,162
May I?

383
00:36:36,622 --> 00:36:38,583
Yes.

384
00:37:37,437 --> 00:37:40,482
Lee, wake up.

385
00:37:40,565 --> 00:37:42,526
This is no time to doze off...

386
00:37:42,567 --> 00:37:46,531
like a freckled-face boy
on a fishing raft.

387
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,787
What's up?

388
00:37:58,751 --> 00:38:02,381
Now, now, Bill.
No need for that.

389
00:38:02,506 --> 00:38:06,051
You didn't think
we'd abandon you, did ya?

390
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:09,555
No, no. The thought
never occurred to me.

391
00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:12,391
Good. We like confidence in an agent.

392
00:38:12,474 --> 00:38:15,394
But don't let it make you careless.

393
00:38:15,477 --> 00:38:17,396
I was, uh -

394
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:19,858
I was just in the...

395
00:38:20,942 --> 00:38:23,820
process of configuring my report.

396
00:38:24,904 --> 00:38:27,949
That's good, Lee. Admirable.

397
00:38:28,074 --> 00:38:30,410
But there have been some changes -

398
00:38:30,493 --> 00:38:33,079
- Changes at the top.
- Oh? Yeah?

399
00:38:33,204 --> 00:38:37,543
Good changes, Bill.
Fresh blood. Sparkling insights.

400
00:38:38,669 --> 00:38:42,631
Uh, Bill, could you do me a favor?

401
00:38:44,967 --> 00:38:46,844
What?

402
00:38:48,179 --> 00:38:51,016
I want you to type
a few words into me -

403
00:38:51,016 --> 00:38:53,143
words that I'll dictate to ya.

404
00:38:56,146 --> 00:38:58,106
Yeah.

405
00:38:59,691 --> 00:39:01,651
Sure. What the hell.

406
00:39:11,496 --> 00:39:14,790
Okay. Now, the first sentence is...

407
00:39:14,916 --> 00:39:20,379
"Homosexuality is the best
all-around cover an agent ever had."

408
00:39:21,589 --> 00:39:23,967
Aw, come on, Bill.

409
00:39:28,013 --> 00:39:31,099
Don't be such a pansy!
Be forceful.

410
00:39:31,183 --> 00:39:33,477
Hurt me.

411
00:39:44,572 --> 00:39:46,825
I love it.

412
00:39:46,866 --> 00:39:50,787
That is a great sentence.

413
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:53,957
These are words to live by, Bill.

414
00:39:54,082 --> 00:39:57,753
I'm glad these words
are going into your report.

415
00:39:57,753 --> 00:40:00,881
Our new management will be so pleased...

416
00:40:01,006 --> 00:40:03,509
that you see our point of view.

417
00:40:06,178 --> 00:40:08,097
What -What point of view?

418
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,433
Well, uh, just that we appreciate...

419
00:40:11,517 --> 00:40:17,190
that you might find the thought
of engaging in, uh, homosexual acts...

420
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:20,986
morally and, uh, possibly even...

421
00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:23,363
physically repulsive...

422
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:26,491
and, uh, we are encouraged...

423
00:40:26,616 --> 00:40:31,080
that you are able to overcome
these personal, uh, barriers...

424
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:36,002
to better serve the cause
to which we are all so devoted.

425
00:40:50,517 --> 00:40:53,729
You have left the Clark Nova at home?

426
00:40:55,105 --> 00:40:57,482
It's doing all right without me.

427
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:08,870
And, uh...

428
00:41:09,954 --> 00:41:14,000
you have contacted Dr. Benway?

429
00:41:16,836 --> 00:41:18,881
I told you before
I never met the man.

430
00:41:18,964 --> 00:41:22,468
Bill, I can smell him on you.

431
00:41:23,677 --> 00:41:27,473
Benway marks out all those
whom he has met like a lemur...

432
00:41:27,473 --> 00:41:31,268
pissing on a liana vine
to mark his territory.

433
00:41:32,144 --> 00:41:34,064
You're a marked man, Bill.

434
00:41:43,865 --> 00:41:45,867
Joanie.

435
00:41:45,951 --> 00:41:48,787
Joanie, shall we go?

436
00:41:48,912 --> 00:41:50,790
Yes. Yes.

437
00:41:57,672 --> 00:42:01,759
Hans. Hans, that couple.

438
00:42:01,843 --> 00:42:04,011
Who are they?

439
00:42:04,136 --> 00:42:07,099
They are Tom and Joan Frost.

440
00:42:08,141 --> 00:42:11,937
Americans who have lived here
a very long time.

441
00:42:11,937 --> 00:42:14,064
They're both writers.

442
00:42:14,147 --> 00:42:16,900
Writers of fiction, like you.

443
00:42:18,819 --> 00:42:20,904
They live in a nice flat...

444
00:42:20,988 --> 00:42:23,616
in the new building
at the foot of the mountain.

445
00:42:23,616 --> 00:42:26,452
They're visited constantly...

446
00:42:26,494 --> 00:42:29,998
by many handsome,
young Interzone men.

447
00:42:30,123 --> 00:42:32,375
Sometimes...

448
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:36,045
two or three at a time.

449
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:39,174
Can you, uh, introduce me?

450
00:42:39,425 --> 00:42:45,222
I do not think
it would be to your advantage.

451
00:42:46,015 --> 00:42:47,892
For some reason...

452
00:42:48,017 --> 00:42:52,646
that woman has taken
a serious dislike to me.

453
00:42:52,646 --> 00:42:54,565
Kiki.

454
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,736
Come sit with us.

455
00:43:03,867 --> 00:43:06,953
Kiki, this is Mr. Lee.

456
00:43:07,037 --> 00:43:09,039
Hello.

457
00:43:09,164 --> 00:43:13,419
Mr. Lee is curious
about the Frost couple.

458
00:43:13,419 --> 00:43:15,755
He would like to meet them.

459
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,799
I think the woman would have
sex with you, Mr. Lee.

460
00:43:19,634 --> 00:43:23,554
The man, he only likes Interzone boys.

461
00:43:25,056 --> 00:43:28,519
I don't want to fuck 'em.
I just want to talk to 'em.

462
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:31,146
You know how
Americans are, Kiki.

463
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:33,190
They love to travel...

464
00:43:33,482 --> 00:43:36,777
and then they only want to meet
other Americans...

465
00:43:36,777 --> 00:43:41,698
and talk about how hard it is
to get a decent hamburger.

466
00:43:41,698 --> 00:43:44,786
There's a party tonight
at the O'Leary place.

467
00:43:44,786 --> 00:43:47,872
Frost will be meeting
a group of us here...

468
00:43:47,872 --> 00:43:50,500
and then walking
through the casbah.

469
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:53,586
My friends and I would be happy
to take you with us.

470
00:43:56,214 --> 00:43:59,551
You're the new writer, aren't you?
You've just arrived.

471
00:43:59,551 --> 00:44:02,721
A few days ago.
I write, uh, reports.

472
00:44:02,847 --> 00:44:07,142
Oh? Uh, and did you
come to Interzone for the boys?

473
00:44:08,644 --> 00:44:11,063
- No, I didn't.
- Tom and I did.

474
00:44:11,146 --> 00:44:13,607
That's quite a hot threesome
you arrived with.

475
00:44:13,607 --> 00:44:17,821
They're very cheap,
and they're really a lot of fun.

476
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,492
Yoo-hoo!

477
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:30,041
You use a Clark Nova, don't you?

478
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,923
To write with. Typewriter.

479
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,925
Oh, I do. Yes.

480
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:40,720
I wouldn't use a Clark Nova myself.

481
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:43,681
- Too demanding.
- Demanding?

482
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:48,227
Oh, come on. We're both writers.
We know what we're talking about.

483
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:52,482
Well, I'm new to this game,
to tell you the truth.

484
00:44:53,442 --> 00:44:57,362
If I get blocked again,
I'll let you try my Martinelli.

485
00:44:58,113 --> 00:45:00,199
Her inventiveness will surprise you.

486
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:03,952
I can't wait.

487
00:45:05,746 --> 00:45:07,665
They say you murdered your wife.

488
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,920
- Is that true?
- Who told you that?

489
00:45:12,003 --> 00:45:14,422
Word gets around.

490
00:45:14,506 --> 00:45:17,800
It wasn't murder.
It was an accident.

491
00:45:18,927 --> 00:45:20,887
There are no accidents.

492
00:45:24,934 --> 00:45:27,394
For example...

493
00:45:28,979 --> 00:45:32,066
I've been killing my own wife slowly,
over a period of years.

494
00:45:32,066 --> 00:45:34,443
- What?
- Well, not intentionally.

495
00:45:34,527 --> 00:45:38,865
I mean, on the level of conscious intention,
it's insane, monstrous.

496
00:45:38,865 --> 00:45:43,036
But you do consciously know it.
You just said it. We're discussing it.

497
00:45:43,912 --> 00:45:45,830
Not consciously.

498
00:45:47,123 --> 00:45:49,709
This is all happening...
telepathically.

499
00:45:49,709 --> 00:45:52,712
- Nonconsciously.
- What do you mean?

500
00:45:54,506 --> 00:45:57,134
If you look carefully at my lips...

501
00:45:57,218 --> 00:46:00,096
you'll realize
that I'm actually saying something else.

502
00:46:00,096 --> 00:46:03,099
I'm not actually telling you
about the several ways...

503
00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:05,101
I'm gradually murdering Joan -

504
00:46:05,184 --> 00:46:07,770
about the housekeeper Fadela,
whom I've hired...

505
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:10,606
to makeJoan deathly ill by witchcraft...

506
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:13,318
about the medicines
and drugs I've given her...

507
00:46:14,194 --> 00:46:18,532
about the constant nibbling away
at her self-esteem and sanity...

508
00:46:18,532 --> 00:46:22,578
that I've managed
without being at all obvious about it.

509
00:46:23,704 --> 00:46:27,499
Whereas Joanie finds that she simply...

510
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:30,211
cannot be as obsessively precise
as she wants to be...

511
00:46:30,211 --> 00:46:34,966
unless she writes
everything in longhand.

512
00:46:36,759 --> 00:46:39,762
Look, uh, I'm afraid, um...

513
00:46:42,182 --> 00:46:45,728
I'm not gonna be
very good company tonight.

514
00:46:45,728 --> 00:46:49,565
Thanks for the invite anyway.
I think, I'll have to take a rain check.

515
00:46:52,693 --> 00:46:54,653
Oh.

516
00:47:08,585 --> 00:47:10,545
Enjoying the beach?

517
00:47:15,467 --> 00:47:20,264
I would never have expected
to see you up and out so early.

518
00:47:21,015 --> 00:47:24,185
You certainly were in rough shape
at the O'Leary party last night.

519
00:47:24,185 --> 00:47:26,646
Was I?

520
00:47:29,732 --> 00:47:33,529
You were very raw -
emotionally, I mean.

521
00:47:33,529 --> 00:47:36,865
You seemed to be in a lot of pain.

522
00:47:36,949 --> 00:47:38,867
Pain.

523
00:47:40,536 --> 00:47:43,747
I don't remember... pain.

524
00:47:44,915 --> 00:47:49,963
And, in fact, I don't remember
the O'Leary party.

525
00:47:51,005 --> 00:47:53,132
In fact, I don't remember you.

526
00:47:54,467 --> 00:47:57,887
Well, it was a very intense
performance in any case.

527
00:47:59,013 --> 00:48:00,932
My name's Cloquet.

528
00:48:06,897 --> 00:48:08,816
Yves Cloquet.

529
00:48:10,901 --> 00:48:13,487
Can I buy you breakfast?

530
00:48:23,915 --> 00:48:27,919
I've seen you around,
but I had no idea you were queer.

531
00:48:29,671 --> 00:48:31,631
Queer.

532
00:48:31,673 --> 00:48:35,218
I saw you arrive
with those three Interzone boys.

533
00:48:35,218 --> 00:48:37,137
What an entrance.

534
00:48:37,429 --> 00:48:39,599
You all looked very...

535
00:48:39,682 --> 00:48:41,684
familiar with each other.

536
00:48:42,894 --> 00:48:44,854
Queer.

537
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,483
A curse.
Been in our family for generations.

538
00:48:49,483 --> 00:48:52,153
The Lees have always been perverts.

539
00:48:54,238 --> 00:48:58,493
I shall never forget
the unspeakable horror...

540
00:48:58,493 --> 00:49:01,955
that froze the lymph in my glands...

541
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:07,044
when the baneful word seared
my reeling brain:

542
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:09,046
I...

543
00:49:09,171 --> 00:49:11,090
was a homosexual.

544
00:49:12,634 --> 00:49:16,179
I thought of the painted,
simpering female impersonators...

545
00:49:16,179 --> 00:49:18,514
I had seen in a Baltimore nightclub.

546
00:49:20,767 --> 00:49:24,812
Could it be possible
I was one of those subhuman things?

547
00:49:27,858 --> 00:49:29,944
I walked the streets in a daze...

548
00:49:30,027 --> 00:49:32,655
like a man with a light concussion.

549
00:49:32,738 --> 00:49:35,407
I would have destroyed myself.

550
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,661
But a wise old queen

551
00:49:39,995 --> 00:49:42,831
Bobo, we called her.

552
00:49:43,875 --> 00:49:45,835
taught me that I had a duty...

553
00:49:45,919 --> 00:49:50,882
to live and to bear my burden
proudly for all to see.

554
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:54,678
Poor Bobo came to a sticky end.

555
00:49:56,054 --> 00:50:00,518
He was riding in
the Duc de Ventre's Hispano-Suiza...

556
00:50:01,143 --> 00:50:03,980
when his falling hemorrhoids
blew out of the car...

557
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:06,440
and wrapped around the rear wheel.

558
00:50:06,566 --> 00:50:10,653
He was completely gutted,
leaving an empty shell...

559
00:50:10,653 --> 00:50:14,532
sitting there
on the giraffe-skin upholstery.

560
00:50:19,121 --> 00:50:21,039
Even the eyes and the brain went...

561
00:50:21,123 --> 00:50:24,501
with a horrible "schlupping" sound.

562
00:50:26,879 --> 00:50:32,092
The duke says he will carry that ghastly
schlup with him to his mausoleum.

563
00:50:35,763 --> 00:50:39,976
You sound as if you could use a drink.
My place?

564
00:50:40,727 --> 00:50:42,687
A drink.

565
00:50:47,901 --> 00:50:49,862
A drink?

566
00:50:50,988 --> 00:50:52,907
No.

567
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:55,826
No, I can't. I gotta go home.

568
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:58,454
I have a...I have a...

569
00:50:58,579 --> 00:51:00,748
I have a report to write.
Excuse me.

570
00:52:27,173 --> 00:52:29,467
Hmm.

571
00:53:07,716 --> 00:53:10,969
You made a big hit
with our young friend Yves.

572
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,186
- Yves?
- Cloquet.

573
00:53:20,605 --> 00:53:23,775
Yves said you were wonderfully funny.

574
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:29,113
Said you did a little routine that made him...
chuckle to himself all day.

575
00:53:34,954 --> 00:53:36,914
Yes, you-you could, um -

576
00:53:38,999 --> 00:53:42,461
You could probably get him into bed
if you worked at it a bit.

577
00:53:42,461 --> 00:53:45,756
Deadly aphrodisiac, humor.

578
00:53:45,881 --> 00:53:48,051
I'm not, uh -

579
00:53:48,176 --> 00:53:50,512
I don't really-

580
00:53:53,473 --> 00:53:55,433
Have you seen Hans around?

581
00:53:55,517 --> 00:53:58,436
Oh, you mean you haven't heard?

582
00:54:00,772 --> 00:54:03,066
No. I haven't heard.

583
00:54:03,191 --> 00:54:06,153
Hans was arrested and deported
two weeks ago.

584
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,740
- Deported.
- Mm-hmm.

585
00:54:12,201 --> 00:54:14,704
They let him take his clothes
and his passport.

586
00:54:14,704 --> 00:54:18,833
That was it.
Everything else - nationalized, as they say.

587
00:54:19,625 --> 00:54:21,545
Why?

588
00:54:21,628 --> 00:54:25,632
He neglected to pay
the right officials, I think.

589
00:54:25,632 --> 00:54:28,510
You knew he ran
a drug factory in the medina?

590
00:54:32,222 --> 00:54:34,725
What, um -

591
00:54:37,687 --> 00:54:39,606
What drug did he manufacture?

592
00:54:39,689 --> 00:54:41,941
Nothing too exotic.

593
00:54:42,025 --> 00:54:46,529
Majoun, I think.
It's a local hash resin-almond paste.

594
00:54:46,529 --> 00:54:48,531
You'd spread it on a muffin likejam.

595
00:54:48,656 --> 00:54:51,034
Try it.

596
00:55:04,548 --> 00:55:07,885
While you're at it,
why don't you try my Martinelli?

597
00:55:11,014 --> 00:55:12,974
Take her now.

598
00:55:14,851 --> 00:55:16,811
Try her out.

599
00:57:06,678 --> 00:57:09,681
Holy shit. That machine doesn't
belong to me. It's Tom Frost's.

600
00:57:09,681 --> 00:57:11,600
My God, Lee...

601
00:57:11,683 --> 00:57:15,270
Surely you know better than to bring
an enemy agent into your own home.

602
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:20,610
You gave me no choice. You were giving her
access to your innermost vulnerabilities...

603
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:22,612
forcing them on her,
for God's sake!

604
00:57:22,695 --> 00:57:24,614
But what am I gonna tell him?

605
00:57:24,697 --> 00:57:26,824
What's your assessment of the situation?

606
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:30,328
Did Frost know that his machine
was an Interzonal agent?

607
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:37,253
He, uh - He and his wife
appear to have a close connection...

608
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:40,005
with the indigenous population here.

609
00:57:42,508 --> 00:57:44,552
His wife.
Yeah, yeah!

610
00:57:44,635 --> 00:57:47,638
Of course!
The key is Joan Frost.

611
00:57:47,721 --> 00:57:52,477
You will seduce her, and you will discover
the substance of her report...

612
00:57:52,477 --> 00:57:54,604
and deliver it directly to me.

613
00:57:54,729 --> 00:57:56,940
Seduce her?
But what about -

614
00:57:57,023 --> 00:57:59,859
What about Kiki and
the Interzone boys? My cover.

615
00:57:59,859 --> 00:58:04,197
It'll work beautifully, Bill.
The opposition will be thrown into total confusion.

616
00:58:54,292 --> 00:58:58,088
- Tom's gone out with the boys.
- I came to see you.

617
00:58:59,381 --> 00:59:01,550
Oh.

618
00:59:19,694 --> 00:59:23,782
There's a great restaurant
in New York looks just like this.

619
00:59:23,782 --> 00:59:25,700
Oh, really?

620
00:59:36,796 --> 00:59:39,590
- You write in longhand.
- Yes.

621
00:59:40,716 --> 00:59:44,262
I'm not good with machines.
They intimidate me.

622
00:59:44,262 --> 00:59:46,055
I think I broke Tom's typewriter.

623
00:59:46,305 --> 00:59:49,685
The Martinelli?
He'll be furious.

624
00:59:49,768 --> 00:59:54,398
- Does he have another one?
- He has that one, the Mujahideen.

625
00:59:54,398 --> 00:59:57,776
- It's Arabic.
- Does he use it much?

626
00:59:57,901 --> 01:00:00,237
Not much.

627
01:00:00,362 --> 01:00:02,281
What happened to the Martinelli?

628
01:00:02,406 --> 01:00:06,035
I probably just
threw it on the floor and smashed it.

629
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:08,371
Probably? You don't know?

630
01:00:08,454 --> 01:00:10,707
I suffer from, um...

631
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:12,750
sporadic hallucinations.

632
01:00:15,086 --> 01:00:17,046
Join the club.

633
01:00:21,385 --> 01:00:23,804
Do you intend to kill Tom's Mujahideen?

634
01:00:25,764 --> 01:00:27,725
Only in self-defense.

635
01:00:27,766 --> 01:00:30,269
I understood writing
could be dangerous.

636
01:00:30,269 --> 01:00:33,147
I didn't realize the danger
came from the machinery.

637
01:00:33,772 --> 01:00:36,067
- What are you talking about?
- I'll show you.

638
01:00:36,067 --> 01:00:37,944
Oh.

639
01:00:45,368 --> 01:00:48,204
- Are you gonna write something in Arabic?
- No.

640
01:00:49,664 --> 01:00:51,792
You are.

641
01:00:51,918 --> 01:00:55,796
I don't like using Tom's things.

642
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:58,466
We don't trespass on each other.

643
01:01:00,593 --> 01:01:04,013
Do you have any objection
to trying some of this?

644
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:09,436
I can't read it.
Is it erotic?

645
01:01:09,478 --> 01:01:11,605
It's, um, fairly erotic.

646
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:13,649
- Kind of uncivilized.
- More erotic.

647
01:01:15,651 --> 01:01:17,986
Filthier.

648
01:01:18,028 --> 01:01:22,241
- Filthier? Okay.
- All you think about.

649
01:01:23,825 --> 01:01:27,830
- Followers of obsolete, unthinkable trades...
- Getting really...

650
01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:30,625
- pretty good here.
- doodling in Etruscan...

651
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:34,837
- addicts of drugs not yet synthesized...
- I'm surpassing myself here.

652
01:01:34,837 --> 01:01:37,382
black marketeers of World War III...

653
01:01:37,507 --> 01:01:39,884
excisors of telepathic sensitivity...

654
01:01:40,009 --> 01:01:43,514
followers of obsolete,
unthinkable trades.

655
01:01:43,514 --> 01:01:46,475
Ooh, this is very good.

656
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:49,979
- Addicts of drugs not yet synthesized-
- Very, very dirty.

657
01:01:51,939 --> 01:01:54,942
World War III...

658
01:01:55,025 --> 01:01:57,946
excisors of telepathic sensitivity...

659
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:01,616
osteopaths of the spirit...

660
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:05,370
investigators of infractions...

661
01:02:05,495 --> 01:02:10,083
denounced by bland,
paranoid chess players.

662
01:02:25,099 --> 01:02:27,018
Joan.

663
01:02:27,101 --> 01:02:29,061
Oh,Joan.

664
01:02:54,297 --> 01:02:56,049
Mrs. Frost!

665
01:02:56,299 --> 01:02:59,093
This is an evil
and insane thing that you are doing.

666
01:02:59,093 --> 01:03:01,429
You must stop it at once!

667
01:03:07,394 --> 01:03:09,355
Pull up your hair.

668
01:03:14,652 --> 01:03:16,570
Who's that?

669
01:03:16,654 --> 01:03:18,615
Oh, my housekeeper.

670
01:04:17,635 --> 01:04:19,596
It's my Mujahideen.

671
01:04:23,516 --> 01:04:26,061
For God's sake!

672
01:04:37,364 --> 01:04:39,909
It jumped of its own accord.

673
01:04:40,034 --> 01:04:42,329
You did see that, didn't you?

674
01:04:45,874 --> 01:04:48,335
Joan, are you all right?
What happened?

675
01:04:49,544 --> 01:04:53,882
Fadela stormed in here, and she
threw your typewriter out the window.

676
01:04:54,841 --> 01:04:56,802
Well, that's it.
The woman has to go.

677
01:04:56,928 --> 01:04:59,764
She certainly seemed deadly to me.

678
01:04:59,889 --> 01:05:03,267
Oh, I knew it.

679
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,687
Look, Tom.

680
01:05:06,812 --> 01:05:08,773
Look.

681
01:05:11,692 --> 01:05:15,072
This is how Fadela's
been controlling you,Joan.

682
01:05:15,739 --> 01:05:18,367
Your blood, your pubic hair,
your fingernails.

683
01:05:18,408 --> 01:05:20,744
Fadela controls nobody,
and you know it.

684
01:05:20,744 --> 01:05:22,704
We have forced control upon her.

685
01:05:22,829 --> 01:05:25,415
Poor woman's probably desperate
to get out of our household.

686
01:05:25,415 --> 01:05:28,377
No, missus.
She's making you say everything...

687
01:05:28,377 --> 01:05:30,255
even that.

688
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:34,133
You must find all of these in your house.
You must destroy them.

689
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:39,555
Bill...

690
01:05:39,681 --> 01:05:41,641
I'm going to need my Martinelli.

691
01:05:43,893 --> 01:05:47,273
I feel desperately insecure
without a typewriter in the house.

692
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:51,777
Yes, well, I haven't had a chance to try it out
yet, Tom. I was kind of hoping -

693
01:05:51,777 --> 01:05:54,863
I'll leave Hafid here with you,Joanie,
in case Fadela comes back.

694
01:05:54,863 --> 01:05:58,909
Bill and I will go to his place
and pick up the Martinelli now.

695
01:05:58,909 --> 01:06:00,953
I'll go with Bill.
You two stay here.

696
01:06:01,078 --> 01:06:02,956
I need to get out.

697
01:06:19,890 --> 01:06:23,769
Fadela's within 30 feet of us.
See if you can find her.

698
01:06:31,569 --> 01:06:33,696
There.

699
01:06:33,779 --> 01:06:35,741
She's right there.

700
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,877
That thing she's cutting up...

701
01:06:48,712 --> 01:06:50,757
have you ever seen that before?

702
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,842
No.

703
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:56,054
Looks like some kind of
sea creature, I think.

704
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:58,932
All those women...

705
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,351
they work for her?

706
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:05,313
In a sense.
They're all Fadela's lovers.

707
01:07:12,071 --> 01:07:14,865
I'm going to have to -

708
01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:18,786
I'm gonna have to
stay here with Fadela -

709
01:07:18,786 --> 01:07:20,829
do penance.

710
01:09:33,972 --> 01:09:36,057
I've been instructed to reveal to you...

711
01:09:36,307 --> 01:09:39,811
that you were programmed
to shoot your wife,Joan Lee.

712
01:09:39,811 --> 01:09:43,314
It was not an act
of free will on your part.

713
01:09:44,565 --> 01:09:46,526
Hey!

714
01:09:48,611 --> 01:09:50,948
Who the fuck asked ya?

715
01:09:52,908 --> 01:09:54,910
You worry me, Bill.

716
01:09:54,994 --> 01:09:58,455
You cause me many anxious moments.

717
01:09:58,539 --> 01:10:01,458
Oh, gee, I hope you're not
losing any sleep.

718
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,586
No need to be nasty, Bill.

719
01:10:03,669 --> 01:10:07,632
There was some thought that you might
actually want to hear this information -

720
01:10:07,632 --> 01:10:10,802
that it might assuage your guilt.

721
01:10:10,927 --> 01:10:15,724
Save the psychoanalysis
for your grasshopper friends.

722
01:10:15,724 --> 01:10:20,103
You have to admit,
it was a pretty tasty setup, Bill.

723
01:10:20,103 --> 01:10:22,940
Joan marries you as part
ofher agent's cover...

724
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:27,320
not realizing that you were
the very enemy agent assigned to kill her.

725
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:30,489
As elegant as it is brilliant.

726
01:10:39,833 --> 01:10:41,793
Wait a minute.

727
01:10:43,670 --> 01:10:48,508
You're saying thatJoan was sent
by Interzone, Incorporated to marry me?

728
01:10:48,508 --> 01:10:53,722
Yeah. In fact, she was sent
to you by Fadela, who was her controller.

729
01:10:53,722 --> 01:10:57,602
We did a lot of groundwork
to set you up in their files...

730
01:10:57,602 --> 01:10:59,812
as the prime candidate for marriage.

731
01:10:59,896 --> 01:11:03,483
And it didn't matter that
I didn't know anything about it?

732
01:11:03,483 --> 01:11:06,778
An unconscious agent
is an effective agent, Bill.

733
01:11:06,778 --> 01:11:11,700
The situation does generate
some ethical paradoxes at times.

734
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,827
I'm the first to admit that.

735
01:11:15,371 --> 01:11:18,666
When you bugs first approached me...

736
01:11:20,334 --> 01:11:23,045
one of your associates suggested...

737
01:11:23,128 --> 01:11:26,257
that Joan was possibly not human.

738
01:11:27,341 --> 01:11:29,552
What did he mean by that?

739
01:11:29,678 --> 01:11:32,347
Women aren't human, Bill.

740
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:34,391
Or perhaps more precisely...

741
01:11:34,432 --> 01:11:36,518
they're a different species from men...

742
01:11:36,601 --> 01:11:40,480
with different wills
and different purposes on Earth.

743
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,482
You know this instinctively, Bill...

744
01:11:42,565 --> 01:11:46,696
and it's your instincts
that make you such a good operative.

745
01:11:47,363 --> 01:11:49,448
I'm talking aboutJoan.

746
01:11:52,576 --> 01:11:54,537
IfJoan Lee wasn't human...

747
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,999
what was she?

748
01:11:58,082 --> 01:12:01,461
Well,Joan was a special case.

749
01:12:02,754 --> 01:12:05,590
Joan was an elite-corps centipede.

750
01:12:09,094 --> 01:12:11,054
Joan was a centipede.

751
01:12:19,022 --> 01:12:20,690
Where's my Martinelli?

752
01:12:20,773 --> 01:12:23,776
Jesus, Tom, are you nuts?

753
01:12:23,901 --> 01:12:27,363
Don't fuck with me, Lee.
I want my typewriter.

754
01:12:28,072 --> 01:12:30,950
A lot of people have tried to silence me.

755
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:33,829
All have failed.

756
01:12:33,912 --> 01:12:36,081
Tom...

757
01:12:36,332 --> 01:12:38,334
she's here...

758
01:12:38,459 --> 01:12:40,377
in pieces.

759
01:12:42,504 --> 01:12:44,590
I fear it's hopeless.

760
01:12:50,513 --> 01:12:52,557
All right.

761
01:12:52,641 --> 01:12:54,851
We're taking your Clark Nova.

762
01:12:54,976 --> 01:12:56,728
Hafid, the bag.

763
01:12:56,811 --> 01:12:58,813
No.

764
01:12:59,856 --> 01:13:01,816
No.

765
01:13:20,086 --> 01:13:23,465
Wh-Wh-What's going on here?

766
01:13:23,507 --> 01:13:26,385
Wait, wait, wait! This is
a heinous mistake you're making.

767
01:13:26,385 --> 01:13:28,762
Lee, do something.
Stop them.

768
01:13:28,845 --> 01:13:32,849
Well, he's got a gun, Clark Nova.
You don't want to lose your best agent, do ya?

769
01:13:32,849 --> 01:13:36,687
You're gonna have to write
a full report, Lee. And I mean full.

770
01:13:36,687 --> 01:13:38,606
How am I gonna write it,
in longhand?

771
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:40,817
Will you take this sack off!

772
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:42,860
This is insubordination!

773
01:13:42,986 --> 01:13:46,864
Ooh,you're all gonna pay for this!
Heads are gonna roll!

774
01:13:46,864 --> 01:13:50,410
Your days in
Interzone are numbered, Lee.

775
01:13:51,035 --> 01:13:53,538
I suggest you give up
the writing game.

776
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:57,459
- Make tracks for another part of the world.
- You guys are gonna-

777
01:14:02,798 --> 01:14:06,010
Fuck 'em all.
Squares on both sides.

778
01:14:07,136 --> 01:14:10,514
I am the only complete man in the industry.

779
01:14:38,878 --> 01:14:41,672
- Bill.
- Bill?

780
01:14:48,722 --> 01:14:52,517
I must be hallucinating.

781
01:14:52,601 --> 01:14:54,519
What are you cats doing here?

782
01:14:54,603 --> 01:14:56,688
We're here to see you, Bill.

783
01:14:56,772 --> 01:14:58,690
Come on.

784
01:14:58,774 --> 01:15:03,071
Yeah, man. It's probably the first time
you haven't been hallucinating in a long time.

785
01:15:03,071 --> 01:15:04,989
What are you talking about?

786
01:15:05,073 --> 01:15:09,661
What are you saying?
Naturally, I've had a few odd moments.

787
01:15:09,661 --> 01:15:12,080
Everybody blacks out in Interzone.

788
01:15:12,330 --> 01:15:14,332
- Wouldn't you?
- Definitely.

789
01:15:14,415 --> 01:15:16,377
Sure.

790
01:15:19,338 --> 01:15:21,507
What's in the pillowcase, Bill?

791
01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:25,886
These are the remains
of my last writing machine.

792
01:15:25,886 --> 01:15:28,055
It's been a big problem for me.

793
01:15:28,305 --> 01:15:30,766
- Mind if I take a look?
- Go ahead.

794
01:15:36,606 --> 01:15:38,858
Wait a minute.
Where are we going?

795
01:15:40,443 --> 01:15:42,362
Oh, man.

796
01:15:42,445 --> 01:15:44,948
- How about back to your place?
- Nope.

797
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:46,992
Why not?

798
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:51,122
I'm not safe there.
I'm a dead duck there.

799
01:15:52,456 --> 01:15:54,500
We'll protect you.

800
01:15:54,625 --> 01:15:57,586
You boys are kidding yourselves.

801
01:15:57,670 --> 01:16:00,840
You're babes in the woods here.

802
01:16:00,965 --> 01:16:02,842
Well, what do you suggest?

803
01:16:02,967 --> 01:16:06,138
We thought it was important for us
to help you get your book together.

804
01:16:06,138 --> 01:16:09,099
Yeah, I've sent sections of it
to my publisher, and they're interested.

805
01:16:09,099 --> 01:16:13,270
- All you gotta do is finish it, man.
- You've already done the hard part.

806
01:16:15,397 --> 01:16:17,399
Book. My book?

807
01:16:17,482 --> 01:16:20,277
Yeah. The one
you've been calling Naked Lunch.

808
01:16:25,742 --> 01:16:28,578
Where did you put
that Bradley the Buyer routine?

809
01:16:28,578 --> 01:16:30,496
Did you find it all?

810
01:16:30,622 --> 01:16:34,459
Yeah. It's on the sofa
right next to the Hassan's Rumpus Room riff.

811
01:16:34,459 --> 01:16:36,836
- It's all right there.
- I'm telling you, boys...

812
01:16:36,836 --> 01:16:38,756
I never saw those pages before.

813
01:16:40,007 --> 01:16:43,510
I truly do suspect
some sort of colossal con.

814
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:46,513
Oh, someone's planted
these pages in your room, right?

815
01:16:46,513 --> 01:16:51,060
Somebody sent all those letters to me
and signed them with your name, right?

816
01:16:52,144 --> 01:16:54,731
A well-orchestrated cabal
could easily manage...

817
01:16:54,731 --> 01:16:57,025
all of these simple things, children.

818
01:16:57,067 --> 01:16:59,361
When will you learn?

819
01:16:59,444 --> 01:17:03,448
They've done you a favor, 'cause this
stuff's gonna get published...

820
01:17:03,448 --> 01:17:05,450
under your name...
and you'll have a career.

821
01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:09,120
Yeah, you'll probably
get into print before we will.

822
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:12,458
For God's sake, Bill,
play ball with this conspiracy.

823
01:17:13,459 --> 01:17:15,419
You're patronizing me, boys...

824
01:17:17,546 --> 01:17:20,549
but I don't mind,
'cause you're so sweet to me, too.

825
01:17:20,549 --> 01:17:23,386
Hey, Martin, listen to this.

826
01:17:24,512 --> 01:17:30,102
"So we start for New Orleans past
iridescent lakes and orange gas flares...

827
01:17:30,102 --> 01:17:32,020
"and swamps and garbage heaps...

828
01:17:32,104 --> 01:17:36,858
"alligators crawling around
in broken bottles and tin cans...

829
01:17:37,734 --> 01:17:39,861
"neon arabesques of motels...

830
01:17:39,987 --> 01:17:45,827
"marooned pimps scream obscenities
at passing cars from islands of rubbish.

831
01:17:47,078 --> 01:17:49,914
New Orleans is a dead museum."

832
01:17:51,082 --> 01:17:53,293
So nice.

833
01:17:53,376 --> 01:17:55,295
Sound familiar, Bill?

834
01:17:58,089 --> 01:18:00,092
First time I ever heard it. Read on.

835
01:18:20,989 --> 01:18:24,868
I think it's time to discuss your, uh...

836
01:18:24,951 --> 01:18:29,289
philosophy of drug use
as it relates to artistic endeavor.

837
01:18:30,457 --> 01:18:33,252
I think it's time
to bring this meeting to order.

838
01:18:34,629 --> 01:18:39,383
I think it's time for you boys
to share my last taste...

839
01:18:39,383 --> 01:18:41,427
of the true black meat.

840
01:18:44,013 --> 01:18:48,894
The flesh of the giant
aquatic Brazilian centipede.

841
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:55,651
So we're still here
in Interzone with Bill, right?

842
01:18:55,651 --> 01:18:57,611
That's right, Hank.

843
01:18:57,694 --> 01:19:00,364
And now we're gonna travel
back to the city, right?

844
01:19:00,364 --> 01:19:04,076
- That's right, Hank.
- I think Bill's on top of things here, don't you?

845
01:19:04,076 --> 01:19:09,707
He has a grip on a certain, uh,
unique reality principle, yes.

846
01:19:09,707 --> 01:19:12,502
I think you both should consider
staying here for a few months.

847
01:19:12,502 --> 01:19:15,922
Everything you could want
is cheap and-and plentiful here.

848
01:19:15,922 --> 01:19:19,842
That reality principle thing
could work for you, too.

849
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:24,348
Well, my mother's all alone,
and she's kind of sick, Bill.

850
01:19:24,348 --> 01:19:27,142
And besides, my book's
as all-American as football.

851
01:19:27,768 --> 01:19:32,147
- Couldn't finish it here.
- America is not a young land.

852
01:19:33,524 --> 01:19:35,484
It is old...

853
01:19:35,526 --> 01:19:37,654
and dirty and evil.

854
01:19:38,738 --> 01:19:41,741
Before the settlers,
before the Indians.

855
01:19:44,035 --> 01:19:46,997
The evil is there waiting.

856
01:19:53,796 --> 01:19:55,715
What about you, Martin?

857
01:19:57,967 --> 01:20:02,346
Maybe you can, uh, move into my place.

858
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:04,348
What do you think?

859
01:20:07,852 --> 01:20:10,480
Stay until you finish the book...

860
01:20:10,564 --> 01:20:12,524
but then come back to us.

861
01:20:30,126 --> 01:20:32,045
You'll be okay?

862
01:20:35,131 --> 01:20:37,050
Yeah. Don't worry about me.

863
01:20:37,133 --> 01:20:40,637
The Zone is full of surprises.

864
01:20:42,096 --> 01:20:45,059
The Zone takes care of its own.

865
01:21:24,392 --> 01:21:27,311
William?

866
01:21:31,483 --> 01:21:33,735
You look terrible.

867
01:21:33,819 --> 01:21:35,779
What are you doing here?

868
01:21:37,364 --> 01:21:39,324
I don't - I don't know.

869
01:21:41,326 --> 01:21:43,745
I just -

870
01:21:45,414 --> 01:21:47,959
My only fr-

871
01:21:48,084 --> 01:21:50,878
My only friends in the -
in the world.

872
01:21:52,463 --> 01:21:57,260
I- I'm afraid I-
I'll never see 'em again.

873
01:21:59,929 --> 01:22:02,807
I feel - feel so -

874
01:22:04,643 --> 01:22:06,895
Oh. Severed.

875
01:22:09,398 --> 01:22:11,525
Come with me.

876
01:22:11,650 --> 01:22:14,987
- Take me home.
- I can't go home.

877
01:22:15,112 --> 01:22:17,114
I can't go home.

878
01:22:22,495 --> 01:22:24,497
Is that your typing machine there?

879
01:22:26,499 --> 01:22:31,463
Foutu.
Broken... beyond repair.

880
01:22:33,006 --> 01:22:35,842
If we fix the typing machine...

881
01:22:35,925 --> 01:22:38,471
we also fix the life.

882
01:22:57,866 --> 01:22:59,785
There. You see?

883
01:22:59,868 --> 01:23:02,496
There's no cause for despair.

884
01:23:02,579 --> 01:23:05,916
In this shop,
anything can be fixed that is broken.

885
01:23:38,534 --> 01:23:40,494
I don't know, Kiki.

886
01:23:42,414 --> 01:23:45,750
They don't seem to be capable
of delicate work here.

887
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:48,712
You must have faith, William.

888
01:23:49,796 --> 01:23:51,756
Look.

889
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,758
We have your new writing machine.

890
01:24:29,713 --> 01:24:32,675
Not bad. Not bad.
Not bad. Not bad.

891
01:24:32,759 --> 01:24:35,595
I feel very comfortable
working with you.

892
01:24:35,595 --> 01:24:39,641
I like that sense of camaraderie in an agent.

893
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:42,060
You must be progressing.

894
01:24:42,143 --> 01:24:46,481
My predecessor felt you had
an ambivalent relationship with him.

895
01:24:48,651 --> 01:24:50,653
- You mean Clark Nova.
- Yes.

896
01:24:51,654 --> 01:24:53,739
How is he?

897
01:24:53,822 --> 01:24:56,659
He's still in the hands of our enemies.

898
01:24:56,784 --> 01:24:59,119
Such are the hazards of our trade.

899
01:24:59,328 --> 01:25:01,330
A hazardous trade, yes.

900
01:25:02,998 --> 01:25:06,169
Your report on the subversive
activities ofJoan Frost...

901
01:25:06,169 --> 01:25:08,546
was a model of its type.

902
01:25:08,672 --> 01:25:12,050
If you continue to develop
your skills as an operative...

903
01:25:12,050 --> 01:25:16,721
I think a top position
with the C.I.A. is not out of reach.

904
01:25:17,764 --> 01:25:20,309
The C.I.A.?
You really think so?

905
01:25:20,434 --> 01:25:24,480
You have the demeanor.
That's something you can't buy.

906
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:27,817
The C.I.A.

907
01:25:30,361 --> 01:25:32,697
The C.I.A.

908
01:25:36,034 --> 01:25:38,829
Now, that's a career
you can really sink your teeth into.

909
01:25:38,870 --> 01:25:40,789
It has...

910
01:25:42,416 --> 01:25:44,376
resonance.

911
01:25:45,711 --> 01:25:48,839
But giving yourself over
to being a writer-

912
01:25:50,507 --> 01:25:52,844
Ah, well.

913
01:25:53,928 --> 01:25:56,973
This stuff is very potent.

914
01:25:57,056 --> 01:25:59,058
The two are very closely related.

915
01:25:59,350 --> 01:26:01,728
So you boys keep telling me.

916
01:26:02,979 --> 01:26:06,941
Well, what's my next assignment?

917
01:26:07,025 --> 01:26:09,528
I'm hungry for adventure.

918
01:26:09,653 --> 01:26:14,700
Excellent.
You know the Swiss dandy Cloquet?

919
01:26:14,742 --> 01:26:16,618
- Yes.
- And?

920
01:26:19,038 --> 01:26:22,666
I think he's a faggito and won't admit it.

921
01:26:22,666 --> 01:26:25,337
That ought to make it all easier.

922
01:26:25,420 --> 01:26:28,715
You will seduce
or otherwise compromise Cloquet.

923
01:26:28,715 --> 01:26:34,638
We have it on good authority
that he's our conduit to Benway.

924
01:26:34,638 --> 01:26:36,723
Dr. Benway, M.D., Ph.D.?

925
01:26:36,806 --> 01:26:41,562
Self-styled. He never actually
made it through medical school.

926
01:26:41,562 --> 01:26:45,775
He runs an interesting little show here
which he calls Interzone, Inc.

927
01:26:45,775 --> 01:26:47,693
Pretentious, if you ask me.

928
01:26:47,777 --> 01:26:49,987
Benway's behind Interzone, Inc.?

929
01:26:50,071 --> 01:26:53,616
The base of his pyramid
is a drug called the black meat.

930
01:26:53,616 --> 01:26:55,618
- The pyramid's tip -
- Is?

931
01:26:55,743 --> 01:26:57,996
Ah. Well, we'd like to know.

932
01:27:02,042 --> 01:27:04,002
Dr. Benway.

933
01:27:06,338 --> 01:27:08,674
- Of course.
- Yes.

934
01:27:08,757 --> 01:27:12,636
- Yes.
- And he's obviously got sensational cover.

935
01:27:12,636 --> 01:27:15,932
He's floated in and out
of the Zone for years...

936
01:27:15,932 --> 01:27:18,351
without anybody actually
ever seeing him.

937
01:27:18,351 --> 01:27:21,562
But now the pressure's on
to place an agent close to him.

938
01:27:21,562 --> 01:27:23,898
Me.

939
01:27:25,149 --> 01:27:27,360
Assessments are being made.

940
01:27:45,045 --> 01:27:48,967
- You're working away, William?
- Yes, Kiki.

941
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:54,889
The machine turns out
to be a very good one.

942
01:27:54,889 --> 01:27:57,100
Muy simpatico.

943
01:27:58,768 --> 01:28:01,438
And I have you to thank for it...

944
01:28:02,773 --> 01:28:04,734
and so I will.

945
01:28:04,817 --> 01:28:06,819
Thank you.

946
01:28:08,487 --> 01:28:11,741
I'm very proud
to be your friend, you know.

947
01:28:13,034 --> 01:28:16,454
I'm very proud
that I can help you to be a writer.

948
01:28:17,913 --> 01:28:21,418
You have done that, Kiki.
You really have.

949
01:28:32,054 --> 01:28:34,556
Would you like some tea?

950
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:36,601
That would be lovely, William.

951
01:28:42,106 --> 01:28:44,025
Kiki.

952
01:28:44,150 --> 01:28:47,945
- Hmm?
- Do you know Cloquet?

953
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:52,660
The Swiss man with the big house
on the Old Valley Road?

954
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:54,536
Cloquet?

955
01:28:56,038 --> 01:29:00,084
Oh, yes, yes.
Yves with the wonderful car.

956
01:29:01,377 --> 01:29:03,337
He has a wonderful car?

957
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:07,299
The most wonderful car.

958
01:29:15,767 --> 01:29:17,852
Enjoying the ride?

959
01:29:17,936 --> 01:29:20,689
I'm wild about it, yes.
Thank you.

960
01:29:20,814 --> 01:29:22,774
It's good to be wild sometimes.

961
01:29:25,361 --> 01:29:28,656
You know, I have often thought of
that funny story you told me...

962
01:29:28,656 --> 01:29:30,574
the first time we met on the beach.

963
01:29:30,658 --> 01:29:33,953
The one about the Duc de Ventre.

964
01:29:34,078 --> 01:29:38,374
At first I didn't know how to take it.

965
01:29:38,416 --> 01:29:41,420
I thought you were
making a pass at me.

966
01:29:44,423 --> 01:29:48,343
Did I ever tell you about the man
who taught his asshole to talk?

967
01:29:49,136 --> 01:29:53,849
His whole abdomen would move up and
down, you dig, farting out the words.

968
01:29:54,933 --> 01:29:56,894
It was unlike anything I ever heard.

969
01:29:56,978 --> 01:29:59,939
Bubbly, thick, stagnant sound.

970
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:02,525
A sound you could smell.

971
01:30:02,650 --> 01:30:04,819
This man worked for the carnival,you dig?

972
01:30:04,819 --> 01:30:07,905
And to start with it was
like a novelty ventriloquist act.

973
01:30:07,947 --> 01:30:10,450
After a while,
the ass started talking on its own.

974
01:30:10,450 --> 01:30:12,911
He would go in
without anything prepared...

975
01:30:12,911 --> 01:30:17,291
and his ass would ad-lib
and toss the gags back at him every time.

976
01:30:18,584 --> 01:30:20,502
Then it developed sort of teethlike...

977
01:30:20,627 --> 01:30:24,923
little raspy incurving hooks
and started eating.

978
01:30:24,923 --> 01:30:27,843
He thought this was cute at first
and built an act around it...

979
01:30:27,843 --> 01:30:31,431
but the asshole would eat its way through
his pants and start talking on the street...

980
01:30:31,431 --> 01:30:33,850
shouting out it wanted equal rights.

981
01:30:33,975 --> 01:30:38,521
It would get drunk, too, and have crying jags.
Nobody loved it.

982
01:30:38,521 --> 01:30:42,150
And it wanted to be kissed,
same as any other mouth.

983
01:30:42,150 --> 01:30:44,486
Finally, it talked all the time,
day and night.

984
01:30:44,486 --> 01:30:48,908
You could hear him for blocks,
screaming at it to shut up...

985
01:30:48,908 --> 01:30:50,868
beating at it with his fists...

986
01:30:50,951 --> 01:30:52,995
and sticking candles up it, but...

987
01:30:54,413 --> 01:30:56,832
nothing did any good,
and the asshole said to him...

988
01:30:56,832 --> 01:30:59,794
"It is you who will shut up
in the end, not me...

989
01:30:59,794 --> 01:31:03,048
"because we don't need you
around here anymore.

990
01:31:03,048 --> 01:31:05,801
I can talk and eat and shit."

991
01:31:07,344 --> 01:31:11,473
After that, he began waking up
in the morning with transparentjelly...

992
01:31:11,473 --> 01:31:14,434
like a tadpole's tail
all over his mouth.

993
01:31:15,602 --> 01:31:19,357
He would tear it off his mouth
and the pieces would stick to his hands...

994
01:31:19,357 --> 01:31:24,028
like burning gasoline jelly
and grow there.

995
01:31:24,028 --> 01:31:27,365
So, finally, his mouth sealed over...

996
01:31:27,490 --> 01:31:29,409
and the whole head...

997
01:31:29,492 --> 01:31:32,912
would have amputated spontaneously
except for the eyes, you dig?

998
01:31:32,912 --> 01:31:36,000
That's the one thing
that the asshole couldn't do was see.

999
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,669
It needed the eyes.

1000
01:31:38,752 --> 01:31:40,796
Nerve connections were blocked...

1001
01:31:40,879 --> 01:31:42,965
and infiltrated and atrophied.

1002
01:31:43,048 --> 01:31:46,677
So, the brain couldn't
give orders anymore.

1003
01:31:46,677 --> 01:31:49,805
It was trapped inside the skull...

1004
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:51,891
sealed off.

1005
01:31:53,852 --> 01:31:55,937
For a while, you could see...

1006
01:31:56,021 --> 01:32:01,401
the silent, helpless suffering
of the brain behind the eyes.

1007
01:32:03,611 --> 01:32:05,864
And then finally
the brain must have died...

1008
01:32:05,864 --> 01:32:07,783
because the eyes went out...

1009
01:32:08,909 --> 01:32:13,914
and there was no more feeling in them
than a crab's eye at the end of a stalk.

1010
01:32:26,845 --> 01:32:30,390
You seem to like my little friend.
I'm so glad.

1011
01:32:30,390 --> 01:32:34,770
I'm writing a business piece
on corporate life in North Africa.

1012
01:32:38,982 --> 01:32:40,902
Oh, my, my.

1013
01:32:40,985 --> 01:32:44,030
We are fragile today, aren't we?

1014
01:32:45,406 --> 01:32:47,408
He has to get to know you first.

1015
01:32:47,533 --> 01:32:51,371
Oh, does he?
Well, let's see what we can do, then.

1016
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:56,460
Kiki, will you come
and see the parrots with me?

1017
01:32:56,460 --> 01:32:58,545
There are cages in the master bedroom.

1018
01:32:58,629 --> 01:33:01,924
I, um, don't think I can, Mr. Cloquet.

1019
01:33:01,965 --> 01:33:04,677
That is, I don't really want to.

1020
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:09,181
I'd particularly like to interview
a certain Dr. Benway.

1021
01:33:11,058 --> 01:33:16,022
Kiki doesn't seem to find my parrots
attractive anymore. Isn't that sad?

1022
01:33:16,022 --> 01:33:19,401
Kiki would love to play
with your parrots, Yves...

1023
01:33:19,401 --> 01:33:24,948
but Kiki is as anxious to contact
this Benway character as I am.

1024
01:33:25,990 --> 01:33:29,578
Fadela, the witch
who works for the Frosts...

1025
01:33:29,578 --> 01:33:31,539
she and Benway are...

1026
01:33:31,622 --> 01:33:33,582
intimates.

1027
01:33:33,624 --> 01:33:35,960
You didn't hear it from me.

1028
01:33:36,085 --> 01:33:38,295
Kiki?

1029
01:33:41,132 --> 01:33:45,846
Go see the fucking parrots,
will you, Kiki? I gotta take a piss.

1030
01:33:47,889 --> 01:33:50,600
Then I'll come and get you,
and we'll go home.

1031
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:52,769
Pissoir's at the end of the great hall.

1032
01:34:24,803 --> 01:34:25,846
Kiki.

1033
01:34:32,061 --> 01:34:33,645
Kiki.

1034
01:34:43,865 --> 01:34:45,450
Kiki.

1035
01:35:26,994 --> 01:35:29,747
Hello, Bill. What's up?

1036
01:35:32,166 --> 01:35:34,043
Something the matter?

1037
01:35:35,086 --> 01:35:37,505
You seem distracted.

1038
01:35:42,761 --> 01:35:45,723
I wish you'd say something.

1039
01:35:45,806 --> 01:35:48,142
I don't like this mood, Bill.

1040
01:35:48,434 --> 01:35:50,728
- Are we going out?
- You're going out.

1041
01:35:50,769 --> 01:35:54,606
Why don't you just write something
and calm yourself down?

1042
01:35:54,606 --> 01:35:57,986
You're obviously not
in a professional state of mind.

1043
01:35:57,986 --> 01:36:01,448
Maybe I should write about
your little double cross.

1044
01:36:01,448 --> 01:36:06,036
You expected me to end up in that
parrot cage with Cloquet, didn't you?

1045
01:36:06,036 --> 01:36:10,040
Bill, are you thinking
of getting rid of me?

1046
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:15,463
I think an exchange of hostages
is the only viable scenario.

1047
01:36:15,463 --> 01:36:18,090
No, really, Bill,
if you get rid of me...

1048
01:36:18,090 --> 01:36:20,092
you sever ties with reality.

1049
01:36:20,384 --> 01:36:22,595
For instance, take the case of-

1050
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:24,680
Oh! Careful!

1051
01:36:24,805 --> 01:36:28,852
Of the female agent who forgot
her real identity and merged with her cover story.

1052
01:36:28,852 --> 01:36:32,564
She is still a fricoteuse in Annexia.

1053
01:36:32,647 --> 01:36:36,068
And incidentally,you can make a square,
heterosex citizen queer...

1054
01:36:36,068 --> 01:36:38,779
with this angle using drugs-

1055
01:36:40,489 --> 01:36:42,449
Tom...

1056
01:36:42,574 --> 01:36:44,535
I've brought you a new typewriter...

1057
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:47,747
which conveniently dispenses
two types of intoxicating fluids...

1058
01:36:47,747 --> 01:36:49,957
when it likes what you've written.

1059
01:36:52,001 --> 01:36:54,921
Are you proposing to trade back
for your Clark Nova?

1060
01:36:56,005 --> 01:36:57,924
Thinking of it.

1061
01:36:58,007 --> 01:37:00,385
Has it written
anything good for you lately?

1062
01:37:01,804 --> 01:37:06,100
No. It's too damned
all-American for my taste.

1063
01:37:06,100 --> 01:37:08,811
Guess I've gone foreign or something.

1064
01:37:10,396 --> 01:37:14,108
Well, my Mugwriter here
is so foreign, it's almost alien.

1065
01:37:14,108 --> 01:37:18,154
You're gonna do
your best work on her. Guaranteed.

1066
01:37:25,662 --> 01:37:30,750
Hafid, bring the machine
in question for Bill, will you?

1067
01:37:44,515 --> 01:37:46,934
And how are you enjoying
your affair with Joan?

1068
01:37:46,934 --> 01:37:51,023
Literate, complex and neurotic,
I would imagine.

1069
01:37:55,068 --> 01:37:57,070
I haven't seen her for weeks.

1070
01:37:58,405 --> 01:38:00,574
She ran off with Fadela and her coven.

1071
01:38:00,699 --> 01:38:02,659
Oh, that's too bad.

1072
01:38:04,953 --> 01:38:08,291
Yes, she does that
when she feels attracted to a man.

1073
01:38:10,001 --> 01:38:13,046
Don't give up though.
It's-It's a good sign.

1074
01:38:13,046 --> 01:38:15,089
With Joanie...

1075
01:38:15,381 --> 01:38:20,053
the courtship period can involve
years of passionate ambivalence.

1076
01:38:25,517 --> 01:38:29,646
Tom, I think we should
take a close look at his machine first...

1077
01:38:29,646 --> 01:38:31,607
test it thoroughly.

1078
01:38:31,732 --> 01:38:35,069
Don't you, Tom?

1079
01:38:35,194 --> 01:38:39,324
You both have different writing styles.

1080
01:38:39,407 --> 01:38:43,495
Bill Lee has always been a man
of powerful instinct, Hafid.

1081
01:38:44,621 --> 01:38:47,040
If he says I'll do
my best work on his machine...

1082
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:48,958
well, I'm sure that's prophecy.

1083
01:38:54,172 --> 01:38:57,051
Take the gun, too, Bill.

1084
01:38:57,134 --> 01:39:02,473
No American should find himself
in a foreign land without a pistol.

1085
01:39:04,392 --> 01:39:07,478
You wouldn't be trying to set me up again,
now, would you, Tom?

1086
01:39:07,478 --> 01:39:11,441
Well, you've set yourself up already, Bill.

1087
01:39:11,441 --> 01:39:14,986
I'm just trying to give you
a fighting chance. That's all.

1088
01:39:33,881 --> 01:39:35,758
Clark Nova.

1089
01:39:35,883 --> 01:39:37,844
Clark Nova, it's me.

1090
01:39:38,970 --> 01:39:40,888
It's - It's Bill Lee.

1091
01:39:40,972 --> 01:39:45,477
Clark Nova, speak to me.
You're safe with me now.

1092
01:39:45,477 --> 01:39:47,438
They tortured me...

1093
01:39:47,479 --> 01:39:51,066
did unspeakable things to me.

1094
01:39:51,150 --> 01:39:54,445
I'm on my last legs.
The bastards.

1095
01:39:55,904 --> 01:39:59,283
Clark Nova, where is Joan?
Where's Joan?

1096
01:40:00,702 --> 01:40:03,496
Hans's old drug factory in the medina.

1097
01:40:04,873 --> 01:40:06,791
Fadela is there.

1098
01:40:06,875 --> 01:40:11,796
Fadela is your point of penetration
into Interzone, Inc.

1099
01:40:13,006 --> 01:40:15,050
Fadela.

1100
01:40:15,175 --> 01:40:17,928
Uh, what do I -
what do I do when I find her?

1101
01:40:17,928 --> 01:40:22,058
You'll know what to do
when the time comes.

1102
01:40:22,058 --> 01:40:24,435
Just remember this -

1103
01:40:24,518 --> 01:40:26,979
all agents defect...

1104
01:40:27,063 --> 01:40:29,732
and all resisters sell out.

1105
01:40:31,150 --> 01:40:33,528
That's the sad truth, Bill.

1106
01:40:33,653 --> 01:40:39,076
And a writer-
a writer lives the sad truth like anyone else.

1107
01:40:39,076 --> 01:40:41,828
The only difference is -

1108
01:40:41,912 --> 01:40:43,872
he files a report on it.

1109
01:40:43,997 --> 01:40:47,000
Leave me now...

1110
01:40:47,125 --> 01:40:49,045
before it's too late.

1111
01:40:49,128 --> 01:40:51,506
But wait. What aboutJoan?
What aboutJoan?

1112
01:40:51,506 --> 01:40:56,094
Go now!
Vaya con dios.

1113
01:40:56,386 --> 01:40:59,764
Clark Nova. Clark Nova -

1114
01:42:18,681 --> 01:42:20,641
Hurry. Hurry.

1115
01:42:22,935 --> 01:42:24,896
Come on.

1116
01:42:34,073 --> 01:42:39,661
Your notes must be much more
carefully detailed to be of any use to us.

1117
01:42:39,661 --> 01:42:42,373
You must write very clearly.

1118
01:42:42,456 --> 01:42:45,960
The effects of the drugs
must be cataloged...

1119
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:48,505
with painstaking accuracy.

1120
01:43:07,942 --> 01:43:09,985
-Joan.
- Hmm?

1121
01:43:10,111 --> 01:43:12,613
-Joan.
- Bill.

1122
01:43:14,657 --> 01:43:16,618
Oh, Bill.

1123
01:43:20,997 --> 01:43:23,125
No.

1124
01:43:23,375 --> 01:43:25,961
No.

1125
01:43:26,086 --> 01:43:29,005
What is that?
What are you writing?

1126
01:43:29,089 --> 01:43:32,009
I'm writing...

1127
01:43:32,093 --> 01:43:35,012
"All is lost...

1128
01:43:35,096 --> 01:43:37,014
...all is lost."

1129
01:43:38,433 --> 01:43:40,601
- It's all I've ever written.
- No.

1130
01:43:45,690 --> 01:43:47,650
No.

1131
01:43:47,692 --> 01:43:49,653
Oh,Joan.

1132
01:43:50,696 --> 01:43:52,614
We have to see Fadela.

1133
01:43:53,699 --> 01:43:55,617
Take me to Fadela.

1134
01:44:16,389 --> 01:44:19,559
Lee, you're here.

1135
01:44:19,684 --> 01:44:21,771
Oh, thank God. Thank God.

1136
01:44:21,896 --> 01:44:26,400
You see, my misdemeanor
has borne sweet fruit.

1137
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:28,360
Now you are with us.

1138
01:44:28,486 --> 01:44:32,531
I was right to approach you so brazenly.

1139
01:44:32,615 --> 01:44:36,369
And now Dr. Benway will have no choice -

1140
01:44:36,452 --> 01:44:39,706
- Benway.
- Benway.

1141
01:44:39,790 --> 01:44:41,750
No choice but to send me back-

1142
01:44:41,875 --> 01:44:44,836
- You'll see.
- Benway.

1143
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:46,880
Where I belong.

1144
01:44:56,808 --> 01:44:58,976
Well, well.

1145
01:44:59,102 --> 01:45:02,063
If it isn't William Lee.

1146
01:45:09,070 --> 01:45:11,407
I got to say I'm proud of you, sir.

1147
01:45:11,490 --> 01:45:14,076
It took you a while,
but you got us red-handed.

1148
01:45:14,076 --> 01:45:15,953
Full marks, boy.
Full marks.

1149
01:45:19,456 --> 01:45:23,085
I expected to see an operation
all out for the black meat here.

1150
01:45:23,085 --> 01:45:25,546
What's with all the Mugwump jism?

1151
01:45:27,674 --> 01:45:29,801
The black meat concession
turns out to have...

1152
01:45:29,801 --> 01:45:33,555
some unfortunate
political strings attached.

1153
01:45:33,555 --> 01:45:35,473
We'vejust cut those strings.

1154
01:45:35,557 --> 01:45:40,562
From now on,
Interzone is strictly Mugwump territory.

1155
01:45:40,562 --> 01:45:45,484
As you can see, we've made
a flying start here with our modest dispensary.

1156
01:45:46,193 --> 01:45:49,113
I can feel the heat
closing in on you, Fadela.

1157
01:45:50,406 --> 01:45:53,075
Feel them out there
making their moves,you dig?

1158
01:45:53,075 --> 01:45:55,578
Oh, really?

1159
01:45:55,661 --> 01:45:57,830
Fadela. Huh.

1160
01:45:57,955 --> 01:46:01,626
Huh.

1161
01:46:01,710 --> 01:46:03,670
You mean this old thing.

1162
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:18,478
- Benway!
- Benway!

1163
01:46:18,603 --> 01:46:20,688
Benway!

1164
01:46:20,813 --> 01:46:22,899
We met once before, remember? Stateside.

1165
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:29,739
You don't remember.
You had that look, boy.

1166
01:46:30,907 --> 01:46:34,078
The look of a...
sheep-killing dog.

1167
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:37,831
Decided to recruit you
right on the spot.

1168
01:46:37,831 --> 01:46:40,667
I'm afraid I was forced
by the tenor of the times...

1169
01:46:40,667 --> 01:46:43,587
to prescribe that wretched
black meat powder to start you off on...

1170
01:46:43,587 --> 01:46:47,967
but the hole-in-the-wall operation,
limited resources -

1171
01:46:47,967 --> 01:46:49,886
you understand the problems.

1172
01:46:51,096 --> 01:46:55,975
But I understand from Cloquet
that, uh, you're on to our good stuff now.

1173
01:46:56,976 --> 01:46:59,479
Mugwump jism can't be beat.

1174
01:46:59,562 --> 01:47:04,777
And as you can see,
we've got ourselves a few more friends now.

1175
01:47:06,028 --> 01:47:08,614
And a few more dollars, too.

1176
01:47:09,865 --> 01:47:11,826
Oh.

1177
01:47:11,909 --> 01:47:15,538
This little, uh, Fadela number
is something I developed...

1178
01:47:15,538 --> 01:47:19,542
during my tenure as chief physician
to the prime minister of Annexia.

1179
01:47:19,542 --> 01:47:24,172
"El Primo" liked to walk the streets
amongst his people in drag, and, well -

1180
01:47:24,172 --> 01:47:26,925
Well...

1181
01:47:27,050 --> 01:47:29,511
one thing led to another.

1182
01:47:33,181 --> 01:47:37,395
It is an elegant way to strike terror
into the hearts of the enemy...

1183
01:47:37,395 --> 01:47:39,355
wouldn't you say?

1184
01:47:39,439 --> 01:47:41,941
Old Fadela must be on the rag.

1185
01:47:43,609 --> 01:47:45,695
She's been acting subversive lately.

1186
01:47:48,656 --> 01:47:51,576
Speaking of new uses
for old technology...

1187
01:47:52,410 --> 01:47:56,540
I think the new order could find
a place for a man of your caliber.

1188
01:47:56,540 --> 01:47:58,500
A .32, wasn't it?

1189
01:47:59,877 --> 01:48:02,171
That is what you're here for, isn't it?

1190
01:48:02,421 --> 01:48:04,548
Hell...

1191
01:48:04,673 --> 01:48:06,925
I could use a reliable man
to send to Annexia.

1192
01:48:06,925 --> 01:48:10,972
We're expanding, boy.
I need a... spearhead.

1193
01:48:12,432 --> 01:48:14,434
Just tell me what you want.

1194
01:48:16,436 --> 01:48:18,146
I want her.

1195
01:48:21,399 --> 01:48:23,568
Her?

1196
01:48:25,821 --> 01:48:28,032
That purulent little cunt?
What for?

1197
01:48:29,950 --> 01:48:31,869
I can't write without her.

1198
01:48:36,665 --> 01:48:39,877
Bill, I feel confident...

1199
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:42,589
that you and I can
work something out.

1200
01:49:15,916 --> 01:49:17,835
Papers, please.

1201
01:49:17,918 --> 01:49:19,837
What is the purpose of your visit...

1202
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:21,839
and what is your profession?

1203
01:49:21,964 --> 01:49:23,966
I write reports. I'm a writer...

1204
01:49:24,091 --> 01:49:28,470
and I intend to write reports on life
in Annexia for the citizens of the U.S.A.

1205
01:49:28,470 --> 01:49:30,514
Do you have any proof of what you say?

1206
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:32,809
How do we know
you are really a writer?

1207
01:49:34,728 --> 01:49:36,688
Well, I have a writing device.

1208
01:49:36,771 --> 01:49:38,523
That's not good enough.

1209
01:49:39,691 --> 01:49:41,651
Show us.

1210
01:49:42,694 --> 01:49:44,738
- Show you.
- Write something.

1211
01:49:50,453 --> 01:49:52,413
- Write something.
- Yes.

1212
01:49:53,539 --> 01:49:55,541
Write something.

1213
01:50:10,891 --> 01:50:13,560
Joan.

1214
01:50:13,685 --> 01:50:15,645
Joan.

1215
01:50:19,609 --> 01:50:22,945
What is it, Bill?
Are we there yet?

1216
01:50:24,572 --> 01:50:26,532
Almost, Joan.

1217
01:50:28,993 --> 01:50:32,538
But I guess it's about time
for our William Tell routine.

1218
01:50:33,790 --> 01:50:35,750
Sure, Bill.

1219
01:51:28,807 --> 01:51:31,852
Welcome... to Annexia.

1220
01:51:32,936 --> 01:51:35,939
Yes. Welcome to Annexia.
