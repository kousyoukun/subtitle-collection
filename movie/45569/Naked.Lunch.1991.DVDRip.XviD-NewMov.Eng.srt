1
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,888
Exterminator.

2
00:03:14,183 --> 00:03:16,004
Mm-hmm.

3
00:03:16,103 --> 00:03:18,403
You want I should spit right in your face?

4
00:03:18,502 --> 00:03:20,891
You want, hmm?
You want? You want?

5
00:03:20,998 --> 00:03:22,820
I ran out.

6
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:25,700
You ran out?
Oh, that's nice.

7
00:03:25,797 --> 00:03:28,579
You ran out.
It's impossible you run out.!

8
00:03:28,678 --> 00:03:30,620
What'd you do, eat the stuff?.

9
00:03:30,725 --> 00:03:32,547
The Chink shortchanged me.

10
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:34,816
No "glot." Come "Fliday."

11
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:43,481
It's funny.
It's actual very funny what you just said.

12
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,444
Ran out.

13
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:49,851
They can either paint it, or draw it, or write
it down and then pass it on to somebody.

14
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:52,641
They read what you're saying,
and then they reexperience.

15
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:54,716
That's the only connection
you have with that, man.

16
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,860
So you can't rewrite...

17
00:03:56,966 --> 00:03:59,583
'cause to rewrite is to deceive and lie...

18
00:03:59,685 --> 00:04:01,507
and you betray your own thoughts.

19
00:04:01,604 --> 00:04:05,696
To rethink the flow and the rhythm
and the tumbling out of the words...

20
00:04:05,957 --> 00:04:07,615
is a betrayal.

21
00:04:07,876 --> 00:04:10,178
And it's a sin, Martin.
It's a sin.

22
00:04:10,278 --> 00:04:12,164
I don't accept your, uh...

23
00:04:12,261 --> 00:04:14,911
Catholic interpretation
of my compulsive, uh...

24
00:04:15,973 --> 00:04:19,901
necessity to rewrite
every single word at least 1 00 times.

25
00:04:20,004 --> 00:04:23,321
Guilt is -Thanks.
Guilt is the key, not sin.

26
00:04:23,428 --> 00:04:26,297
Guilt re not writing
the best that I can.

27
00:04:26,404 --> 00:04:30,265
Guilt re not, uh, considering everything
from every possible angle.

28
00:04:30,372 --> 00:04:32,226
Balancing everything.

29
00:04:32,324 --> 00:04:37,211
Well, how about guilt
re censoring your best thoughts?

30
00:04:37,315 --> 00:04:40,064
Your most honest,
primitive, real thoughts...

31
00:04:40,164 --> 00:04:43,480
because that's what your laborious
rewriting amounts to, Martin.

32
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:46,458
Is rewriting really censorship, Bill?

33
00:04:46,563 --> 00:04:49,464
Because I'm completely fucked if it is.

34
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:52,604
Exterminate all rational thought.

35
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,812
That is the conclusion I have come to.

36
00:04:54,915 --> 00:04:57,882
What is the man talking about?
I'm being serious.

37
00:04:57,986 --> 00:04:59,841
So is he.

38
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,694
So how is the extermination business
going there, Bill?

39
00:05:05,762 --> 00:05:09,537
Somebody's stealing my roach powder.
Somebody's got it in for me.

40
00:05:09,635 --> 00:05:12,384
Hmm. Well, Bill,
maybe you should take it as a sign.

41
00:05:12,482 --> 00:05:14,718
Maybe you ought to try your hand
at writing pornography.

42
00:05:14,978 --> 00:05:18,175
Yeah, a novel a week at 120 bucks.
It's serious money.

43
00:05:18,274 --> 00:05:20,129
I can connect you with the guy.

44
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:23,041
We're thinking of
collaborating on one ourselves.

45
00:05:23,137 --> 00:05:25,112
I gave up writing when I was 1 0.

46
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:29,633
- Too dangerous.
- Only if someone reads what you write.

47
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,999
So far we haven't had that problem.

48
00:05:32,257 --> 00:05:34,166
I've found my profession.
I'm an exterminator.

49
00:05:34,274 --> 00:05:37,622
Of course, Bill. That's just what the world needs-
more literate exterminators.

50
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:39,552
Give me a cigarette.

51
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:46,106
Of course, then, you know...

52
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:49,209
you're gonna have trouble
if you can't keep track of your roach powder.

53
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,059
Wait a minute.
Do you boys know something about this?

54
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,047
We don't exactly know anything.

55
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:05,013
No, but we suspect
it's a domestic problem.

56
00:06:08,032 --> 00:06:11,196
-
-

57
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:41,503
- My God, what are you doing?
- You weren't supposed to see this.

58
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:45,079
Well, now that I'm seeing it, what is it?

59
00:06:46,207 --> 00:06:48,061
I'm shooting up your bug powder.

60
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:51,476
You might like to try it yourself.

61
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,405
Or you might not.

62
00:06:53,503 --> 00:06:56,852
I ran out in the middle of a job.

63
00:06:59,774 --> 00:07:01,848
You gotta stop using the stuff,Joan.

64
00:07:01,951 --> 00:07:04,372
They ration it out like snakebite serum.

65
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:06,453
Well,just do what everybody else does -

66
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:08,826
cut it with baby laxative.

67
00:07:09,086 --> 00:07:11,125
The roaches will
shit themselves to death.

68
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:14,550
It's the best job I ever had.

69
00:07:14,653 --> 00:07:16,793
If I run out again, I'm finished.

70
00:07:18,941 --> 00:07:20,851
Hmm.

71
00:07:22,493 --> 00:07:24,151
It's, um -

72
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,372
It's a very literary high.

73
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:31,357
Very literary.

74
00:07:31,453 --> 00:07:33,493
Is that why Hank and Martin
know all about it?

75
00:07:33,596 --> 00:07:35,931
No, we just, uh -

76
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:38,811
We all just tried it together-
spur of the moment thing.

77
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:40,916
They didn't like it, I did.

78
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,110
What do you mean,
it's a literary high?

79
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,572
It's a Kafka high.

80
00:07:48,637 --> 00:07:50,644
You feel like a bug.

81
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,843
Try some.

82
00:07:58,204 --> 00:08:00,091
Well, I don't know.

83
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,169
I don't know.

84
00:08:08,827 --> 00:08:12,537
- I think our metabolisms are very different.
- Whose?

85
00:08:12,603 --> 00:08:14,491
Yours and Kafka's?

86
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:18,585
I thought you were finished
with doing weird stuff.

87
00:08:20,123 --> 00:08:23,506
I thought I was, too,
but I guess I'm not.

88
00:08:28,795 --> 00:08:31,162
Personally...

89
00:08:31,258 --> 00:08:34,389
I prefer a pyrethrum job to a fluoride.

90
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:36,312
With the pyrethrum...

91
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,996
you kill the roaches right there
in front of God and the client...

92
00:08:39,226 --> 00:08:41,266
whereas this starch and fluoride-

93
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,542
leave it around,
the roaches eat it...

94
00:08:43,642 --> 00:08:46,544
come back a few days later,
they're running around fat as hogs.

95
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:51,769
And there it is, Bill.
You want to put on some weight...

96
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:55,510
you gotta switch
from that yellow powder diet of yours...

97
00:08:55,609 --> 00:08:58,130
to some of this good
fluoride stuff right here.

98
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:01,715
Sure works for the Chink.
He's healthy enough.

99
00:09:01,817 --> 00:09:03,705
You see him scarfthat poison down?

100
00:09:03,801 --> 00:09:07,249
He doesn't really eat it.

101
00:09:07,353 --> 00:09:09,208
It's sleight of hand.

102
00:09:09,273 --> 00:09:13,136
The hell he doesn't. Been breathing in
the powder so long, it just makes him laugh.

103
00:09:13,242 --> 00:09:16,919
Just like them roaches.

104
00:09:28,378 --> 00:09:30,233
William Lee.

105
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:36,856
- What is this?
- He's Hauser. I'm O'Brien.

106
00:09:36,953 --> 00:09:39,255
City Narcotics.
We're gonna take you downtown, Bill.

107
00:09:39,353 --> 00:09:42,734
Little matter of possession
of a dangerous substance.

108
00:09:49,624 --> 00:09:51,861
You've got quite a record, Bill.

109
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,739
A lot of drugs poured down the old vein.

110
00:09:55,992 --> 00:09:58,164
I was a troubled person then.
I'm married now.

111
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,086
Straight. Got a good job.

112
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:02,769
That's good, Bill.
That's nice.

113
00:10:04,696 --> 00:10:07,663
- What's this, then?
- That's my job.

114
00:10:07,736 --> 00:10:09,591
I use it to kill bugs.

115
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:12,525
- He says it kills bugs.
- He could be right.

116
00:10:12,632 --> 00:10:14,868
- I'd like to see it.
- Me, too.

117
00:10:15,127 --> 00:10:17,996
- I'd like to see it, too.
- Well, gee.

118
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:23,381
I'd like to demonstrate, but I already
got rid of that last case of crabs I had.

119
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,831
Very funny, Bill.

120
00:10:28,343 --> 00:10:30,732
But, you know...

121
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,878
I think we got a bug
around here somewhere.

122
00:10:32,982 --> 00:10:35,438
You're right.

123
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:38,739
Let's see if that yellow stuff will kill it.

124
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,770
We'll be back later
to see how it worked out, kiddo.

125
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:37,843
Yeah.

126
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,827
Break a leg.

127
00:11:43,796 --> 00:11:46,894
William Lee?

128
00:11:46,996 --> 00:11:51,022
I have arranged all this
just to have a moment alone with you.

129
00:11:51,124 --> 00:11:53,393
I am your case officer.

130
00:11:54,676 --> 00:11:57,459
- Uh, my what?
- Case officer.

131
00:11:57,556 --> 00:11:59,694
You are my agent.

132
00:11:59,796 --> 00:12:02,894
I, in turn, report to your controller.

133
00:12:02,996 --> 00:12:07,567
Come, come, Mr. Lee.
You don't have to play dumb with me.

134
00:12:07,668 --> 00:12:10,483
Oh. No. Well...

135
00:12:11,507 --> 00:12:13,395
that would be foolish, wouldn't it?

136
00:12:13,491 --> 00:12:15,980
It would. Say, Bill...

137
00:12:17,042 --> 00:12:21,199
do you think you could rub
some of this powder on my lips?

138
00:12:23,187 --> 00:12:25,042
Uh, yeah.

139
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:26,994
Sure.

140
00:12:37,107 --> 00:12:38,764
Well, now.

141
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,032
As you might have expected...

142
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:46,702
I have instructions
for you from Control.

143
00:12:49,106 --> 00:12:51,920
It's about the little woman.

144
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,808
- The what?
- The little woman.

145
00:12:56,913 --> 00:12:58,801
Your little woman.

146
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:02,443
- Your wife.
- Tell me.

147
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:06,470
Your wife is not really your wife.

148
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:10,352
She is an agent of Interzone Incorporated.

149
00:13:10,448 --> 00:13:12,336
You must kill her.

150
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:14,218
KillJoan Lee.

151
00:13:14,481 --> 00:13:17,775
It must be done soon-
this week.

152
00:13:17,872 --> 00:13:21,549
And it must be done real tasty.

153
00:13:21,616 --> 00:13:23,656
Interzone Incorporated?

154
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,281
An organization based in Interzone...

155
00:13:26,384 --> 00:13:30,541
a notorious free port
on the North African coast.

156
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:33,996
A haven for
the mongrel scum of the Earth...

157
00:13:34,096 --> 00:13:37,991
an engorged parasite
on the underbelly of the West.

158
00:13:38,096 --> 00:13:40,648
Ah, I can't see it.

159
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:42,955
Why would a classy
American woman likeJoan...

160
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:47,398
ever want to work for a two-bit outfit
like Interzone Incorporated?

161
00:13:47,504 --> 00:13:50,187
But who says Joan Lee is really a woman?

162
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:54,281
In fact, who says she's human at all?

163
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:59,530
- What do you mean by that?
- I can say no more.

164
00:14:04,847 --> 00:14:06,374
Hey, where you going?

165
00:14:06,447 --> 00:14:08,586
Don't do it. Don't do it.
There'll be hell to pay.

166
00:15:08,972 --> 00:15:11,907
We've been made.
We gotta get out of town.

167
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:13,922
Wait a minute.

168
00:15:15,308 --> 00:15:18,625
- What's going on?
- I got busted for bug powder.

169
00:15:18,732 --> 00:15:21,700
I started hallucinating behind the stuff.

170
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:26,533
God knows what I really said
to those two flatfeet.

171
00:15:26,603 --> 00:15:29,800
I'm not even sure
how I got out of there.

172
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,899
Did you bring back
tomorrow's bug powder?

173
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:34,760
Did you, Bill?
Did you?

174
00:15:37,132 --> 00:15:40,874
My God,Joan.
You're acting like a full-fledged junkie.

175
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,288
And it's bug powder,
for Christ's sake!

176
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,266
Oh.

177
00:15:59,755 --> 00:16:02,918
I do have a little bit of a habit, yes, hon.

178
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:06,630
You ought to at least give me
a few marks for originality.

179
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:09,447
How did you know
it just wouldn't kill you?

180
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:13,129
I don't know, Bill.

181
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:17,793
I felt drawn to it.

182
00:16:17,898 --> 00:16:20,002
You know?

183
00:16:20,106 --> 00:16:24,546
Like you feel drawn... to an old lover.

184
00:16:27,594 --> 00:16:30,146
Say, Bill...

185
00:16:30,217 --> 00:16:33,065
could you rub
some of this powder on my lips?

186
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,271
Could you, Bill?

187
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:41,833
Please?

188
00:17:31,976 --> 00:17:34,048
Hey!

189
00:17:35,528 --> 00:17:38,692
Bill.

190
00:17:41,223 --> 00:17:43,133
Hey, where were you this morning?

191
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:45,061
We missed you at the Automat.

192
00:17:46,151 --> 00:17:48,419
I, uh, got in a bit of a jam.

193
00:17:48,487 --> 00:17:51,651
I misplaced the gear,
in a manner of speaking.

194
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:54,053
Yeah.
We heard about it.

195
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:57,795
We saw you go off with the heat, in fact.

196
00:17:58,855 --> 00:18:01,243
They won't give it back to Cohen.

197
00:18:01,318 --> 00:18:03,173
It's evidence, they say.

198
00:18:03,238 --> 00:18:07,013
Yeah. It's an embarrassment, yes.

199
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:11,395
Is that why you tried to lift mine?

200
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:15,902
That's unkind, Edward.

201
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:18,624
"Lift" is unkind.

202
00:18:20,134 --> 00:18:23,265
I'm doing a job for a friend.

203
00:18:24,293 --> 00:18:29,181
The centipedes, Edward.
The centipedes are getting downright arrogant.

204
00:18:29,253 --> 00:18:31,195
They're starting to attack his children.

205
00:18:31,302 --> 00:18:34,019
Take it from me, Bill.

206
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:37,697
You're not the first one
to develop a bug powder problem.

207
00:18:37,765 --> 00:18:39,740
See this man.

208
00:18:39,845 --> 00:18:42,594
He'll help ya.

209
00:18:42,693 --> 00:18:45,791
"Dr. A. Benway...

210
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:48,413
General Practitioner."

211
00:18:49,508 --> 00:18:51,330
Bug powder?

212
00:18:52,324 --> 00:18:54,430
- You mean, uh, pyrethrum?
- Yes.

213
00:18:55,556 --> 00:18:59,386
Hmm. I get a lot of you folks
in the extermination trade.

214
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,871
You better help this friend of yours
get off the yellow stuff.

215
00:19:03,972 --> 00:19:07,387
- It'll kill him.
- How do I get him to kick?

216
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:11,518
- Kick?
- H-How do I get him off it?

217
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:13,507
Oh.

218
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,993
Mix it with this.

219
00:19:17,988 --> 00:19:21,336
Gradually increase the percentage of black
without telling your friend...

220
00:19:21,442 --> 00:19:24,028
and he'll lose his taste
for the bug powder soon enough.

221
00:19:30,786 --> 00:19:32,609
What is it?
What does it do?

222
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:35,706
Oh, it's all natural.
It's made from, uh...

223
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:39,357
aquatic Brazilian centipede
or some such outlandish thing.

224
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:43,551
It shuts down the brain's
response to the bug powder. That's all.

225
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:45,506
The powder becomes
irrelevant to the addict...

226
00:19:45,763 --> 00:19:48,152
and the addict then
ceases to be addicted.

227
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,812
Side effects?

228
00:19:51,971 --> 00:19:53,793
Nothing that will surprise the addict.

229
00:19:54,884 --> 00:19:57,949
But, uh, before I -
before I do your cure...

230
00:19:58,211 --> 00:20:00,098
I've gotta score some bug powder.

231
00:20:01,314 --> 00:20:03,169
Score?

232
00:20:04,226 --> 00:20:07,357
You're not trying to... pull a fast one
on the old doctor, are you?

233
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:09,280
I came here for help.

234
00:20:10,754 --> 00:20:12,696
Of course you did.

235
00:20:16,738 --> 00:20:18,593
Phew!

236
00:20:18,658 --> 00:20:20,513
My God.

237
00:20:20,578 --> 00:20:24,353
It smells like a... tainted cheese.

238
00:20:26,754 --> 00:20:29,536
You'll see how elegantly this works.

239
00:20:31,201 --> 00:20:33,089
The black will disappear completely.

240
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,829
And there'll be no smell,
no discoloration.

241
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:47,135
It's like an agent -

242
00:20:47,232 --> 00:20:49,720
an agent who's come to believe
his own cover story...

243
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:52,640
but who's in there, hiding...

244
00:20:52,896 --> 00:20:55,165
in a larval state...

245
00:20:55,263 --> 00:20:58,079
just waiting
for the proper moment to hatch out.

246
00:21:11,552 --> 00:21:13,494
Extra, extra.! Read all about it.!

247
00:21:34,622 --> 00:21:36,662
Thirty-nine cents,just for today.! Special.

248
00:21:36,766 --> 00:21:38,970
Thirty-nine cents.
Fresh cabbage.

249
00:21:52,766 --> 00:21:54,969
Centipedes.

250

263
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:12,080
Hi, Bill.

264
00:23:13,532 --> 00:23:15,506
Say, why don't you and I join them?

265
00:23:52,313 --> 00:23:55,128
Hank and I were just bored.
It wasn't serious.

266
00:23:55,194 --> 00:23:57,048
I didn't take it seriously.

267
00:23:57,114 --> 00:23:59,022
Where is Hank?

268
00:23:59,129 --> 00:24:01,202
He got embarrassed and left.

269
00:24:02,394 --> 00:24:04,281
Not before he came, I hope.

270
00:24:04,377 --> 00:24:06,743
Hank's on junk.
He doesn't come.

271
00:24:08,506 --> 00:24:10,709
Not before you came, I hope.

272
00:24:10,777 --> 00:24:14,422
I'm on bug powder.
I don't need to come.

273
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:18,711
"Officials of unconstituted police states...

00:24:38,968 --> 00:24:42,797
I guess it's about time
for our William Tell routine.

280
00:25:20,535 --> 00:25:22,390
Oh, God.

281
00:25:22,455 --> 00:25:24,310
Oh, God.

282
00:25:28,215 --> 00:25:30,157
Joan.

283
00:25:30,263 --> 00:25:32,151
Joan.

284
00:25:35,094 --> 00:25:36,982
Oh,Joan.

285
00:26:16,565 --> 00:26:19,150
Are you a faggot?

286
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:27,924
Not by nature, no.

287
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,907
I'm not.

288
00:26:31,093 --> 00:26:33,994
I wouldn't say... faggot.

289
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,148
No.

290
00:26:37,908 --> 00:26:42,381
However, circumstances have forced me
to consider the possibility that -

291
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:48,777
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.

292
00:26:48,883 --> 00:26:51,054
He specializes in sexual ambivalence.

293
00:26:53,171 --> 00:26:55,026
Sexual ambulance, did you say?

294
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,058
My God.

295
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:04,977
He's called Mugwump.

296
00:27:08,883 --> 00:27:10,922
No point in feigning surprise.

297
00:27:10,994 --> 00:27:13,897
You knew we would be
getting in touch with you.

298
00:27:14,002 --> 00:27:17,613
Why else would you come
to a waterfront dive like this?

299
00:27:18,674 --> 00:27:20,497
Why else?

300
00:27:20,594 --> 00:27:23,496
I suggest a Clark Nova portable.

301
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:25,838
It has mythic resonance.

302
00:27:26,098 --> 00:27:29,414
Clark Nova. A typewriter?
You suggest it for what?

303
00:27:29,489 --> 00:27:32,751
For your report
from Interzone, of course.

304
00:27:32,849 --> 00:27:36,078
Handwriting is not
considered professional.

305
00:27:36,177 --> 00:27:38,032
Interzone.

306
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,945
My report.

307
00:27:41,042 --> 00:27:44,871
And don't leave out
any of the tasty details -

308
00:27:44,978 --> 00:27:47,366
the small red hole in the forehead...

309
00:27:47,474 --> 00:27:49,296
or...

310
00:27:49,394 --> 00:27:51,728
the look of astonishment on her face.

311
00:27:53,969 --> 00:27:57,831
Listen to me.
You'rejust gonna have to leave town...

312
00:27:57,905 --> 00:27:59,760
and Interzone is the only place...

313
00:27:59,858 --> 00:28:03,152
that'll have a shady character
like you at such short notice.

314
00:28:03,216 --> 00:28:05,071
Take this.

315
00:28:05,136 --> 00:28:07,951
Take what?
What is that?

316
00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:10,416
Your ticket to Interzone.

317
00:28:10,513 --> 00:28:12,717
Tourist class, I'm afraid...

318
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:15,533
but what can you expect these days?

319
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,246
We'll contact you there.

320
00:28:52,974 --> 00:28:55,363
Hmm. It's commie trash.

321
00:28:56,431 --> 00:28:58,373
And it's been fired very recently.

322
00:28:58,478 --> 00:29:00,485
You use it in a holdup?

323
00:29:02,351 --> 00:29:05,514
I want that-that typewriter in the window.
I want the portable.

324
00:29:09,966 --> 00:29:11,875
This plus...

325
00:29:11,982 --> 00:29:13,869
$8.00.

326
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,451
You got any ammo to go with it?

327
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,558
These'll cover the state tax.

328
00:29:33,678 --> 00:29:36,012
- Bill.
- Martin.

329
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,450
Listen, Bill, I told the police
it was a drunken accident, that I saw it.

330
00:29:41,517 --> 00:29:43,819
So at least that's on the record.
They're after you though.

331
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:46,437
They're saying that -
that you escaped from custody...

332
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:49,857
and murdered your wife,
and-and they want you.

333
00:29:51,948 --> 00:29:54,282
I'd better-
I'd better lie low till my ship sails.

334
00:29:54,381 --> 00:29:57,696
- You booked passage somewhere already?
- Sure. Look.

335
00:29:57,804 --> 00:30:00,138
Got my ticket.

336
00:30:00,235 --> 00:30:03,302
Put this away,
for God's sake, Bill.

337
00:30:03,404 --> 00:30:05,640
- I'll send you a report.
- You'll send me a report?

338
00:30:05,739 --> 00:30:08,674
Well, I'll send you
a copy of the report.

339
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:11,333
Are you gonna be all right?

340
00:30:13,163 --> 00:30:15,204
I hear Interzone's really nice
this time of year.

341
00:31:08,073 --> 00:31:10,113
He woke up in bed...

342
00:31:10,187 --> 00:31:12,804
to find himself wedged...

343
00:31:12,907 --> 00:31:14,761
between a Dutch transvestite...

344
00:31:14,858 --> 00:31:18,305
and six Arab men.

345
00:31:19,594 --> 00:31:21,448
Clark Nova.

346
00:31:22,537 --> 00:31:24,577
Very nice for writing reports.

347
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:30,854
I use a Krups Dominator myself.

348
00:31:32,873 --> 00:31:35,012
Company policy.

349
00:31:44,104 --> 00:31:45,992
You're American, correct?

350
00:31:48,265 --> 00:31:50,173
You know Dr. Benway?

351
00:31:52,392 --> 00:31:55,840
I am interested in selling...

352
00:31:55,944 --> 00:31:57,886
a large stash of the black meat.

353
00:31:57,991 --> 00:31:59,814
Verstehen Sie?

354
00:31:59,911 --> 00:32:02,562
The sun-dried, powdered black meat...

355
00:32:02,664 --> 00:32:07,301
of the giant aquatic Brazilian centipede.

356
00:32:07,367 --> 00:32:09,255
And...

357
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:13,286
for some reason...

358
00:32:13,384 --> 00:32:18,337
I am certain that you are working
for Herr Dr. Benway.

359
00:32:21,736 --> 00:32:23,775
I'm - I-I-I'm sorry.

360
00:32:23,879 --> 00:32:25,984
I apparently mistook you
for somebody else.

361
00:32:26,246 --> 00:32:29,563
But as it happens, Mr. Lee,
I am, among other things...

362
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:32,931
a provider of rare services to the arts...

363
00:32:33,031 --> 00:32:37,787
and in my experience
as a provider of rare services to the arts...

364
00:32:37,895 --> 00:32:40,993
I have found that writers
are a-a particularly needy group.

365
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:45,183
Is there nothing
I can provide for you...

366
00:32:46,406 --> 00:32:48,064
Mr. Lee?

367
00:33:17,733 --> 00:33:20,286
A very professional...

368
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,212
operation...

369
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,212
as you can see, Mr. Lee.

370
00:33:27,718 --> 00:33:29,506
You like a taste?

371
00:33:30,821 --> 00:33:34,367
I'd be happy to join you in a taste,
if you're planning to have one.

372
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:56,762
You can understand
that if you were...

373
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:01,178
a purchasing agent
for a foreign power...

374
00:34:01,283 --> 00:34:04,131
how it would be
to my advantage...

375
00:34:04,228 --> 00:34:07,489
to impress you with the cleanliness...

376
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:10,304
and the sincerity...

377
00:34:10,404 --> 00:34:12,379
of our operation.

378
00:34:14,692 --> 00:34:17,953
- You, uh, mentioned a Dr. -
- Benway.

379
00:34:18,051 --> 00:34:20,571
- Benway.
- Benway. Correct.

380
00:34:20,675 --> 00:34:22,530
Yes.

381
00:34:23,587 --> 00:34:25,442
Does he qualify as a foreign power?

382
00:34:25,538 --> 00:34:29,335
Oh, but yes!
He's very foreign.

383
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:42,144
May I?

384
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:46,401
Yes.

385
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:45,751
Lee, wake up.

386
00:35:45,856 --> 00:35:47,710
This is no time to doze off...

387
00:35:47,776 --> 00:35:51,158
like a freckled-face boy
on a fishing raft.

388
00:35:55,744 --> 00:35:57,567
What's up?

389
00:36:03,295 --> 00:36:06,775
Now, now, Bill.
No need for that.

390
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:10,175
You didn't think
we'd abandon you, did ya?

391
00:36:10,271 --> 00:36:13,532
No, no. The thought
never occurred to me.

392
00:36:13,632 --> 00:36:16,348
Good. We like confidence in an agent.

393
00:36:16,447 --> 00:36:19,229
But don't let it make you careless.

394
00:36:19,327 --> 00:36:21,149
I was, uh -

395
00:36:21,247 --> 00:36:23,516
I was just in the...

396
00:36:24,543 --> 00:36:27,325
process of configuring my report.

397
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:31,284
That's good, Lee. Admirable.

398
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,660
But there have been some changes -

399
00:36:33,727 --> 00:36:36,214
- Changes at the top.
- Oh? Yeah?

400
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:40,061
Good changes, Bill.
Fresh blood. Sparkling insights.

401
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:45,362
Uh, Bill, could you do me a favor?

402
00:36:47,582 --> 00:36:49,404
What?

403
00:36:50,685 --> 00:36:53,304
I want you to type
a few words into me -

404
00:36:53,406 --> 00:36:55,446
words that I'll dictate to ya.

405
00:36:58,301 --> 00:37:00,211
Yeah.

406
00:37:01,725 --> 00:37:03,580
Sure. What the hell.

407
00:37:13,053 --> 00:37:16,217
Okay. Now, the first sentence is...

408
00:37:16,316 --> 00:37:21,172
"Homosexuality is the best
all-around cover an agent ever had."

409
00:37:22,715 --> 00:37:24,985
Aw, come on, Bill.

410
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:31,828
Don't be such a pansy!
Be forceful.

411
00:37:31,932 --> 00:37:34,136
Hurt me.

412
00:37:44,764 --> 00:37:46,902
I love it.

413
00:37:46,971 --> 00:37:50,713
That is a great sentence.

414
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:53,778
These are words to live by, Bill.

415
00:37:53,884 --> 00:37:57,299
I'm glad these words
are going into your report.

416
00:37:57,403 --> 00:38:00,402
Our new management will be so pleased...

417
00:38:00,507 --> 00:38:02,928
that you see our point of view.

418
00:38:05,466 --> 00:38:07,321
What -What point of view?

419
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:10,518
Well, uh,just that we appreciate...

420
00:38:10,587 --> 00:38:15,922
that you might find the thought
of engaging in, uh, homosexual acts...

421
00:38:16,026 --> 00:38:19,671
morally and, uh, possibly even...

422
00:38:19,771 --> 00:38:21,974
physically repulsive...

423
00:38:22,076 --> 00:38:24,977
and, uh, we are encouraged...

424
00:38:25,082 --> 00:38:29,272
that you are able to overcome
these personal, uh, barriers...

425
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:33,680
to better serve the cause
to which we are all so devoted.

426
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:51,061
You have left the Clark Nova at home?

427
00:38:52,409 --> 00:38:54,679
It's doing all right without me.

428
00:39:03,737 --> 00:39:05,592
And, uh...

429
00:39:06,648 --> 00:39:10,510
you have contacted Dr. Benway?

430
00:39:13,241 --> 00:39:15,183
I told you before
I never met the man.

431
00:39:15,288 --> 00:39:18,637
Bill, I can smell him on you.

432
00:39:19,801 --> 00:39:23,346
Benway marks out all those
whom he has met like a lemur...

433
00:39:23,448 --> 00:39:26,677
pissing on a liana vine
to mark his territory.

434
00:39:27,927 --> 00:39:29,750
You're a marked man, Bill.

435
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,069
Joanie.

436
00:39:41,175 --> 00:39:43,892
Joanie, shall we go?

437
00:39:43,991 --> 00:39:45,813
Yes. Yes.

438
00:39:52,407 --> 00:39:56,302
Hans. Hans, that couple.

439
00:39:56,406 --> 00:39:58,478
Who are they?

440
00:39:58,582 --> 00:40:01,430
They are Tom and Joan Frost.

441
00:40:02,422 --> 00:40:05,967
Americans who have lived here
a very long time.

442
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:08,110
They're both writers.

443
00:40:08,214 --> 00:40:10,833
Writers of fiction, like you.

444
00:40:12,662 --> 00:40:14,669
They live in a nice flat...

445
00:40:14,743 --> 00:40:17,164
in the new building
at the foot of the mountain.

446
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:19,987
They're visited constantly...

447
00:40:20,053 --> 00:40:23,402
by many handsome,
young Interzone men.

448
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,681
Sometimes...

449
00:40:25,782 --> 00:40:29,196
two or three at a time.

450
00:40:30,517 --> 00:40:32,208
Can you, uh, introduce me?

451
00:40:32,437 --> 00:40:37,619
I do not think
it would be to your advantage.

452
00:40:38,742 --> 00:40:40,563
For some reason...

453
00:40:40,662 --> 00:40:45,036
that woman has taken
a serious dislike to me.

454
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,965
Kiki.

455
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,997
Come sit with us.

456
00:40:55,893 --> 00:40:58,828
Kiki, this is Mr. Lee.

457
00:40:58,901 --> 00:41:00,843
Hello.

458
00:41:00,949 --> 00:41:04,778
Mr. Lee is curious about the Frost couple.

459
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:07,281
He would like to meet them.

460
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,803
I think the woman would have
sex with you, Mr. Lee.

461
00:41:10,996 --> 00:41:14,771
The man, he only likes Interzone boys.

462
00:41:16,212 --> 00:41:19,441
I don't want to fuck 'em.
I just want to talk to 'em.

463
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,028
You know how
Americans are, Kiki.

464
00:41:22,132 --> 00:41:24,020
They love to travel...

465
00:41:24,276 --> 00:41:27,342
and then they only want to meet
other Americans...

466
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:32,081
and talk about how hard it is
to get a decent hamburger.

467
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:35,027
There's a party tonight at the O'Leary place.

468
00:41:35,124 --> 00:41:38,026
Frost will be meeting
a group of us here...

469
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,587
and then walking
through the casbah.

470
00:41:40,691 --> 00:41:43,179
My friends and I would be happy
to take you with us.

471
00:41:46,098 --> 00:41:49,164
You're the new writer, aren't you?
You've just arrived.

472
00:41:49,267 --> 00:41:52,333
A few days ago.
I write, uh, reports.

473
00:41:52,434 --> 00:41:56,177
Oh? Uh, and did you
come to Interzone for the boys?

474
00:41:58,003 --> 00:42:00,305
- No, I didn't.
- Tom and I did.

475
00:42:00,402 --> 00:42:02,672
That's quite a hot threesome
you arrived with.

476
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:06,414
They're very cheap,
and they're really a lot of fun.

477
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:11,281
Yoo-hoo!

478
00:42:16,018 --> 00:42:18,505
You use a Clark Nova, don't you?

479
00:42:22,066 --> 00:42:24,171
To write with. Typewriter.

480
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:26,096
Oh, I do. Yes.

481
00:42:26,161 --> 00:42:28,746
I wouldn't use a Clark Nova myself.

482
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:31,598
- Too demanding.
- Demanding?

483
00:42:32,689 --> 00:42:35,558
Oh, come on. We're both writers.
We know what we're talking about.

484
00:42:36,753 --> 00:42:39,655
Well, I'm new to this game,
to tell you the truth.

485
00:42:40,945 --> 00:42:44,328
If I get blocked again,
I'll let you try my Martinelli.

486
00:42:45,457 --> 00:42:47,432
Her inventiveness will surprise you.

487
00:42:48,721 --> 00:42:51,055
I can't wait.

488
00:42:52,752 --> 00:42:54,607
They say you murdered your wife.

489
00:42:56,368 --> 00:42:58,670
- Is that true?
- Who told you that?

490
00:42:58,767 --> 00:43:01,069
Word gets around.

491
00:43:01,169 --> 00:43:04,300
It wasn't murder.
It was an accident.

492
00:43:05,391 --> 00:43:07,279
There are no accidents.

493
00:43:11,151 --> 00:43:13,518
For example...

494
00:43:15,023 --> 00:43:17,892
I've been killing my own wife slowly,
over a period of years.

495
00:43:17,998 --> 00:43:20,268
- What?
- Well, not intentionally.

496
00:43:20,367 --> 00:43:24,426
I mean, on the level of conscious intention,
it's insane, monstrous.

497
00:43:24,527 --> 00:43:28,139
But you do consciously know it.
You just said it. We're discussing it.

498
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,182
Not consciously.

499
00:43:32,432 --> 00:43:34,820
This is all happening...
telepathically.

500
00:43:34,928 --> 00:43:37,797
- Nonconsciously.
- What do you mean?

501
00:43:39,535 --> 00:43:42,023
If you look carefully at my lips...

502
00:43:42,127 --> 00:43:44,811
you'll realize
that I'm actually saying something else.

503
00:43:44,879 --> 00:43:47,661
I'm not actually telling you
about the several ways...

504
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:49,668
I'm gradually murdering Joan -

505
00:43:49,775 --> 00:43:52,164
about the housekeeper Fadela,
whom I've hired...

506
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:54,956
to makeJoan deathly ill by witchcraft...

507
00:43:55,055 --> 00:43:57,159
about the medicines
and drugs I've given her...

508
00:43:58,415 --> 00:44:02,474
about the constant nibbling away
at her self-esteem and sanity...

509
00:44:02,574 --> 00:44:06,022
that I've managed
without being at all obvious about it.

510
00:44:07,503 --> 00:44:11,179
Whereas Joanie finds that she simply...

511
00:44:11,278 --> 00:44:13,699
cannot be as obsessively precise
as she wants to be...

512
00:44:13,774 --> 00:44:17,930
unless she writes
everything in longhand.

513
00:44:20,045 --> 00:44:22,915
Look, uh, I'm afraid, um...

514
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:28,525
I'm not gonna be
very good company tonight.

515
00:44:28,621 --> 00:44:31,917
Thanks for the invite anyway.
I think I'll - I'll have to take a rain check.

516
00:44:35,308 --> 00:44:37,196
Oh.

517
00:44:50,572 --> 00:44:52,427
Enjoying the beach?

518
00:44:57,164 --> 00:45:01,354
I would never have expected
to see you up and out so early.

519
00:45:02,477 --> 00:45:05,443
You certainly were in rough shape
at the O'Leary party last night.

520
00:45:05,515 --> 00:45:07,882
Was I?

521
00:45:10,827 --> 00:45:14,405
You were very raw -
emotionally, I mean.

522
00:45:14,475 --> 00:45:17,671
You seemed to be in a lot of pain.

523
00:45:17,771 --> 00:45:19,593
Pain.

524
00:45:21,195 --> 00:45:24,293
I don't remember... pain.

525
00:45:25,419 --> 00:45:29,827
And, in fact, I don't remember
the O'Leary party.

526
00:45:31,242 --> 00:45:33,282
In fact, I don't remember you.

527
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:37,440
Well, it was a very intense
performance in any case.

528
00:45:38,922 --> 00:45:40,744
My name's Cloquet.

529
00:45:46,474 --> 00:45:48,328
Yves Cloquet.

530
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:52,802
Can I buy you breakfast?

531
00:46:02,794 --> 00:46:06,242
I've seen you around,
but I had no idea you were queer.

532
00:46:08,329 --> 00:46:10,184
Queer.

533
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:13,545
I saw you arrive
with those three Interzone boys.

534
00:46:13,642 --> 00:46:15,497
What an entrance.

535
00:46:15,753 --> 00:46:17,825
You all looked very...

536
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:19,839
familiar with each other.

537
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:22,888
Queer.

538
00:46:24,457 --> 00:46:27,043
A curse.
Been in our family for generations.

539
00:46:27,306 --> 00:46:29,891
The Lees have always been perverts.

540
00:46:31,881 --> 00:46:35,678
I shall never forget
the unspeakable horror...

541
00:46:35,946 --> 00:46:39,294
that froze the lymph in my glands...

542
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:44,102
when the baneful word seared
my reeling brain -

543
00:46:44,169 --> 00:46:46,077
I...

544
00:46:46,185 --> 00:46:48,039
was a homosexual.

545
00:46:49,512 --> 00:46:52,808
I thought of the painted,
simpering female impersonators...

546
00:46:52,904 --> 00:46:55,173
I had seen in a Baltimore nightclub.

547
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,801
Could it be possible
I was one of those subhuman things?

548
00:47:04,103 --> 00:47:06,110
I walked the streets in a daze...

549
00:47:06,216 --> 00:47:08,704
like a man with a light concussion.

550
00:47:08,807 --> 00:47:11,360
I would have destroyed myself-

551
00:47:12,584 --> 00:47:14,471
But a wise old queen-

552
00:47:15,751 --> 00:47:18,468
Bobo, we called her-

553
00:47:19,496 --> 00:47:21,350
taught me that I had a duty...

554
00:47:21,447 --> 00:47:25,790
to live and to bear my burden
proudly for all to see.

555
00:47:27,336 --> 00:47:29,823
Poor Bobo came to a sticky end.

556
00:47:31,175 --> 00:47:35,037
He was riding in
the Duc de Ventre's Hispano-Suiza...

557
00:47:36,038 --> 00:47:38,656
when his falling hemorrhoids
blew out of the car...

558
00:47:38,758 --> 00:47:41,125
and wrapped around the rear wheel.

559
00:47:41,222 --> 00:47:45,052
He was completely gutted,
leaving an empty shell...

560
00:47:45,158 --> 00:47:48,474
sitting there
on the giraffe-skin upholstery.

561
00:47:53,286 --> 00:47:55,107
Even the eyes and the brain went...

562
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:58,435
with a horrible "schlupping" sound.

563
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:05,313
The duke says he will carry that ghastly
schlup with him to his mausoleum.

564
00:48:09,221 --> 00:48:12,899
You sound as if you could use a drink.
My place?

565
00:48:13,988 --> 00:48:15,876
A drink.

566
00:48:20,869 --> 00:48:22,756
A drink?

567
00:48:23,844 --> 00:48:25,666
No.

568
00:48:25,764 --> 00:48:28,481
No, I can't. I gotta go home.

569
00:48:28,548 --> 00:48:31,003
I have a -
I have a -

570
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:33,180
I have a report to write.
Excuse me.

571
00:49:56,065 --> 00:49:58,269
Hmm.

572
00:50:34,943 --> 00:50:37,660
You made a big hit
with our young friend Yves.

573
00:50:42,527 --> 00:50:45,015
- Yves?
- Cloquet.

574
00:50:47,327 --> 00:50:50,361
Yves said you were wonderfully funny.

575
00:50:50,463 --> 00:50:55,067
Said you did a little routine that made him...
chuckle to himself all day.

576
00:51:01,087 --> 00:51:02,974
Yes, you-you could, um -

577
00:51:04,958 --> 00:51:08,024
You could probably get him into bed
if you worked at it a bit.

578
00:51:08,286 --> 00:51:11,449
Deadly aphrodisiac, humor.

579
00:51:11,551 --> 00:51:13,655
I'm not, uh -

580
00:51:13,758 --> 00:51:15,994
I don't really-

581
00:51:18,846 --> 00:51:20,701
Have you seen Hans around?

582
00:51:20,799 --> 00:51:23,581
Oh, you mean you haven't heard?

583
00:51:25,822 --> 00:51:28,059
No. I haven't heard.

584
00:51:28,158 --> 00:51:30,613
Hans was arrested and deported
two weeks ago.

585
00:51:32,542 --> 00:51:34,429
- Deported.
- Mm-hmm.

586
00:51:36,798 --> 00:51:39,100
They let him take his clothes
and his passport.

587
00:51:39,198 --> 00:51:42,744
That was it.
Everything else - nationalized, as they say.

588
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,756
Why?

589
00:51:45,854 --> 00:51:49,629
He neglected to pay
the right officials, I think.

590
00:51:49,694 --> 00:51:52,028
You knew he ran
a drug factory in the medina?

591
00:51:55,997 --> 00:51:58,419
What, um -

592
00:52:01,245 --> 00:52:03,067
What drug did he manufacture?

593
00:52:03,165 --> 00:52:05,304
Nothing too exotic.

594
00:52:05,405 --> 00:52:09,660
Majoun, I think.
It's a local hash resin-almond paste.

595
00:52:09,725 --> 00:52:11,634
You'd spread it on a muffin likejam.

596
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:14,042
Try it.

597
00:52:27,004 --> 00:52:29,818
While you're at it,
why don't you try my Martinelli?

598
00:52:33,213 --> 00:52:35,067
Take her now.

599
00:52:36,892 --> 00:52:38,747
Try her out.

600
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,901
Holy shit. That machine doesn't
belong to me. It's Tom Frost's.

601
00:54:26,999 --> 00:54:28,822
My God, Lee...

602
00:54:28,919 --> 00:54:32,236
Surely you know better than to bring
an enemy agent into your own home.

603
00:54:32,344 --> 00:54:37,395
You gave me no choice. You were giving her
access to your innermost vulnerabilities...

604
00:54:37,496 --> 00:54:39,383
forcing them on her,
for God's sake!

605
00:54:39,479 --> 00:54:41,334
But what am I gonna tell him?

606
00:54:41,399 --> 00:54:43,438
What's your assessment of the situation?

607
00:54:43,544 --> 00:54:46,413
Did Frost know that his machine
was an Interzonal agent?

608
00:54:49,207 --> 00:54:53,330
He, uh - He and his wife
appear to have a close connection...

609
00:54:53,431 --> 00:54:56,081
with the indigenous population here.

610
00:54:58,487 --> 00:55:00,429
His wife.
Yeah, yeah!

611
00:55:00,535 --> 00:55:03,382
Of course!
The key is Joan Frost.

612
00:55:03,478 --> 00:55:07,787
You will seduce her, and you will discover
the substance of her report...

613
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:10,094
and deliver it directly to me.

614
00:55:10,197 --> 00:55:12,336
Seduce her?
But what about -

615
00:55:12,406 --> 00:55:15,025
What about Kiki and
the Interzone boys? My cover.

616
00:55:15,126 --> 00:55:18,868
It'll work beautifully, Bill.
The opposition will be thrown into total confusion.

617
00:56:07,318 --> 00:56:10,580
- Tom's gone out with the boys.
- I came to see you.

618
00:56:12,181 --> 00:56:14,286
Oh.

619
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:35,499
There's a great restaurant
in New York looks just like this.

620
00:56:35,605 --> 00:56:37,460
Oh, really?

621
00:56:48,085 --> 00:56:50,768
- You write in longhand.
- Yes.

622
00:56:51,829 --> 00:56:54,992
I'm not good with machines.
They intimidate me.

623
00:56:55,252 --> 00:56:56,943
I think I broke Tom's typewriter.

624
00:56:57,204 --> 00:57:00,433
The Martinelli?
He'll be furious.

625
00:57:00,531 --> 00:57:04,907
- Does he have another one?
- He has that one, the Mujahideen.

626
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:08,209
- It's Arabic.
- Does he use it much?

627
00:57:08,309 --> 00:57:10,578
Not much.

628
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:12,531
What happened to the Martinelli?

629
00:57:12,628 --> 00:57:16,011
I probably just
threw it on the floor and smashed it.

630
00:57:16,116 --> 00:57:18,352
Probably? You don't know?

631
00:57:18,452 --> 00:57:20,591
I suffer from, um...

632
00:57:20,691 --> 00:57:22,579
sporadic hallucinations.

633
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,675
Join the club.

634
00:57:30,836 --> 00:57:33,170
Do you intend to kill Tom's Mujahideen?

635
00:57:35,059 --> 00:57:36,914
Only in self-defense.

636
00:57:36,979 --> 00:57:39,117
I understood writing
could be dangerous.

637
00:57:39,379 --> 00:57:41,713
I didn't realize the danger
came from the machinery.

638
00:57:42,707 --> 00:57:44,813
- What are you talking about?
- I'll show you.

639
00:57:44,916 --> 00:57:46,738
Oh.

640
00:57:53,843 --> 00:57:56,177
- Are you gonna write something in Arabic?
- No.

641
00:57:57,971 --> 00:58:00,011
You are.

642
00:58:00,115 --> 00:58:03,824
I don't like using Tom's things.

643
00:58:03,923 --> 00:58:06,410
We don't trespass on each other.

644
00:58:08,435 --> 00:58:11,337
Do you have any objection
to trying some of this?

645
00:58:14,194 --> 00:58:16,911
I can't read it.
Is it erotic?

646
00:58:16,977 --> 00:58:19,017
It's, um, fairly erotic.

647
00:58:19,122 --> 00:58:20,944
- Kind of uncivilized.
- More erotic.

648
00:58:22,898 --> 00:58:25,102
Filthier.

649
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:28,814
- Filthier? Okay.
- All you think about.

650
00:58:30,706 --> 00:58:34,481
- Followers of obsolete, unthinkable trades...
- Getting really...

651
00:58:34,578 --> 00:58:37,131
- pretty good here.
- doodling in Etruscan...

652
00:58:37,234 --> 00:58:41,162
- addicts of drugs not yet synthesized...
- I'm surpassing myself here.

653
00:58:41,266 --> 00:58:43,721
black marketeers of World War III...

654
00:58:43,825 --> 00:58:46,127
excisors of telepathic sensitivity...

655
00:58:46,226 --> 00:58:49,521
followers of obsolete,
unthinkable trades.

656
00:58:49,585 --> 00:58:52,432
Ooh, this is very good.

657
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,398
- Addicts of drugs not yet synthesized-
- Very, very dirty.

658
00:58:57,681 --> 00:59:00,551
World War III...

659
00:59:00,658 --> 00:59:03,440
excisors of telepathic sensitivity...

660
00:59:04,466 --> 00:59:06,953
osteopaths of the spirit...

661
00:59:07,057 --> 00:59:10,570
investigators of infractions...

662
00:59:10,673 --> 00:59:14,699
denounced by bland,
paranoid chess players.

663
00:59:29,488 --> 00:59:31,310
Joan.

664
00:59:31,408 --> 00:59:33,295
Oh,Joan.

665
00:59:57,487 --> 00:59:59,145
Mrs. Frost!

666
00:59:59,407 --> 01:00:01,993
This is an evil
and insane thing that you are doing.

667
01:00:02,095 --> 01:00:04,332
You must stop it at once!

668
01:00:10,031 --> 01:00:11,918
Pull up your hair.

669
01:00:17,008 --> 01:00:18,830
Who's that?

670
01:00:18,928 --> 01:00:20,782
Oh, my housekeeper.

671
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:19,277
It's my Mujahideen.

672
01:01:23,021 --> 01:01:25,476
For God's sake!

673
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:38,755
Itjumped of its own accord.

674
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:41,065
You did see that, didn't you?

675
01:01:44,461 --> 01:01:46,850
Joan, are you all right?
What happened?

676
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:51,777
Fadela stormed in here, and-and
she threw your typewriter out the window.

677
01:01:53,069 --> 01:01:54,978
Well, that's it.
The woman has to go.

678
01:01:55,085 --> 01:01:57,801
She certainly seemed deadly to me.

679
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:01,162
Oh, I knew it.

680
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:04,452
Look, Tom.

681
01:02:04,556 --> 01:02:06,443
Look.

682
01:02:09,228 --> 01:02:12,076
This is how Fadela's
been controlling you,Joan.

683
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,555
Your blood, your pubic hair,
your fingernails.

684
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:17,864
Fadela controls nobody,
and you know it.

685
01:02:17,932 --> 01:02:19,819
We have forced control upon her.

686
01:02:19,916 --> 01:02:22,337
Poor woman's probably desperate
to get out of our household.

687
01:02:22,412 --> 01:02:25,129
No, missus.
She's making you say everything...

688
01:02:25,228 --> 01:02:27,050
even that.

689
01:02:27,148 --> 01:02:30,344
You must find all of these in your house.
You must destroy them.

690
01:02:33,228 --> 01:02:35,977
Bill...

691
01:02:36,075 --> 01:02:37,962
I'm going to need my Martinelli.

692
01:02:40,107 --> 01:02:42,955
I feel desperately insecure
without a typewriter in the house.

693
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:47,588
Yes, well, I haven't had a chance to try it out
yet, Tom. I was kind of hoping -

694
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:50,538
I'll leave Hafid here with you,Joanie,
in case Fadela comes back.

695
01:02:50,635 --> 01:02:54,432
Bill and I will go to his place
and pick up the Martinelli now.

696
01:02:54,539 --> 01:02:56,481
I'll go with Bill.
You two stay here.

697
01:02:56,587 --> 01:02:58,409
I need to get out.

698
01:03:14,634 --> 01:03:17,950
Fadela's within 30 feet of us.
See if you can find her.

699
01:03:25,834 --> 01:03:27,874
There.

700
01:03:27,946 --> 01:03:29,834
She's right there.

701
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:40,511
That thing she's cutting up...

702
01:03:42,282 --> 01:03:44,224
have you ever seen that before?

703
01:03:44,329 --> 01:03:46,238
No.

704
01:03:46,346 --> 01:03:49,215
Looks like some kind of
sea creature, I think.

705
01:03:49,322 --> 01:03:52,071
All those women...

706
01:03:52,169 --> 01:03:54,405
they work for her?

707
01:03:54,505 --> 01:03:57,800
In a sense.
They're all Fadela's lovers.

708
01:04:04,681 --> 01:04:07,365
I'm going to have to -

709
01:04:07,466 --> 01:04:11,011
I'm gonna have to
stay here with Fadela -

710
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:13,087
do penance.

711
01:06:20,773 --> 01:06:22,748
I've been instructed to reveal to you...

712
01:06:23,013 --> 01:06:26,275
that you were programmed
to shoot your wife,Joan Lee.

713
01:06:26,373 --> 01:06:29,307
It was not an act
of free will on your part.

714
01:06:30,916 --> 01:06:32,804
Hey!

715
01:06:34,789 --> 01:06:37,025
Who the fuck asked ya?

716
01:06:38,916 --> 01:06:40,827
You worry me, Bill.

717
01:06:40,933 --> 01:06:44,228
You cause me many anxious moments.

718
01:06:44,325 --> 01:06:47,074
Oh, gee, I hope you're not
losing any sleep.

719
01:06:47,141 --> 01:06:49,148
No need to be nasty, Bill.

720
01:06:49,252 --> 01:06:52,962
There was some thought that you might
actually want to hear this information -

721
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:56,094
that it might assuage your guilt.

722
01:06:56,196 --> 01:07:00,735
Save the psychoanalysis
for your grasshopper friends.

723
01:07:00,804 --> 01:07:04,928
You have to admit,
it was a pretty tasty setup, Bill.

724
01:07:04,996 --> 01:07:07,647
Joan marries you as part
ofher agent's cover...

725
01:07:07,716 --> 01:07:11,676
not realizing that you were
the very enemy agent assigned to kill her.

726
01:07:11,939 --> 01:07:14,972
As elegant as it is brilliant.

727
01:07:23,908 --> 01:07:25,796
Wait a minute.

728
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:32,126
You're saying thatJoan was sent
by Interzone, Incorporated to marry me?

729
01:07:32,228 --> 01:07:37,181
Yeah. In fact, she was sent
to you by Fadela, who was her controller.

730
01:07:37,251 --> 01:07:40,895
We did a lot of groundwork
to set you up in their files...

731
01:07:40,963 --> 01:07:43,068
as the prime candidate for marriage.

732
01:07:43,171 --> 01:07:46,519
And it didn't matter that
I didn't know anything about it?

733
01:07:46,594 --> 01:07:49,660
An unconscious agent
is an effective agent, Bill.

734
01:07:49,763 --> 01:07:54,399
The situation does generate
some ethical paradoxes at times.

735
01:07:54,498 --> 01:07:56,505
I'm the first to admit that.

736
01:07:57,987 --> 01:08:01,151
When you bugs first approached me...

737
01:08:02,755 --> 01:08:05,341
one of your associates suggested...

738
01:08:05,442 --> 01:08:08,442
thatJoan was possibly not human.

739
01:08:09,475 --> 01:08:11,613
What did he mean by that?

740
01:08:11,714 --> 01:08:14,267
Women aren't human, Bill.

741
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:16,225
Or perhaps more precisely...

742
01:08:16,290 --> 01:08:18,265
they're a different species from men...

743
01:08:18,370 --> 01:08:22,015
with different wills
and different purposes on Earth.

744
01:08:22,082 --> 01:08:23,991
You know this instinctively, Bill...

745
01:08:24,097 --> 01:08:27,643
and it's your instincts
that make you such a good operative.

746
01:08:28,674 --> 01:08:30,681
I'm talking aboutJoan.

747
01:08:33,665 --> 01:08:35,576
IfJoan Lee wasn't human...

748
01:08:37,026 --> 01:08:38,880
what was she?

749
01:08:38,946 --> 01:08:42,207
Well,Joan was a special case.

750
01:08:43,426 --> 01:08:46,143
Joan was an elite-corps centipede.

751
01:08:49,538 --> 01:08:51,392
Joan was a centipede.

752
01:08:59,041 --> 01:09:00,634
Where's my Martinelli?

753
01:09:00,737 --> 01:09:03,606
Jesus, Tom, are you nuts?

754
01:09:03,712 --> 01:09:06,647
Don't fuck with me, Lee.
I want my typewriter.

755
01:09:07,712 --> 01:09:10,079
A lot of people have tried to silence me.

756
01:09:11,232 --> 01:09:13,239
All have failed.

757
01:09:13,312 --> 01:09:15,385
Tom...

758
01:09:15,649 --> 01:09:17,558
she's here...

759
01:09:17,665 --> 01:09:19,519
in pieces.

760
01:09:21,569 --> 01:09:23,543
I fear it's hopeless.

761
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:31,190
All right.

762
01:09:31,296 --> 01:09:33,401
We're taking your Clark Nova.

763
01:09:33,504 --> 01:09:35,195
Hafid, the bag.

764
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:37,183
No.

765
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:40,095
No.

766
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,829
Wh-Wh-What's going on here?

767
01:10:00,895 --> 01:10:03,546
Wait, wait, wait! This is
a heinous mistake you're making.

768
01:10:03,647 --> 01:10:05,916
Lee, do something.
Stop them.

769
01:10:06,015 --> 01:10:09,725
Well, he's got a gun, Clark Nova.
You don't want to lose your best agent, do ya?

770
01:10:09,823 --> 01:10:13,435
You're gonna have to write
a full report, Lee. And I mean full.

771
01:10:13,535 --> 01:10:15,357
How am I gonna write it,
in longhand?

772
01:10:15,455 --> 01:10:17,462
Will you take this sack off!.

773
01:10:17,566 --> 01:10:19,454
This is insubordination.!

774
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:23,162
Ooh,you're all gonna pay for this.!
Heads are gonna roll.!

775
01:10:23,263 --> 01:10:26,296
Your days in Interzone are numbered, Lee.

776
01:10:27,294 --> 01:10:29,683
I suggest you give up
the writing game.

777
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:33,052
- Make tracks for another part of the world.
- You guys are gonna-

778
01:10:38,559 --> 01:10:41,624
Fuck 'em all.
Squares on both sides.

779
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:45,566
I am the only complete man in the industry.

780
01:11:13,149 --> 01:11:15,833
- Bill.
- Bill?

781
01:11:22,589 --> 01:11:26,233
I must be hallucinating.

782
01:11:26,333 --> 01:11:28,155
What are you cats doing here?

783
01:11:28,253 --> 01:11:30,227
We're here to see you, Bill.

784
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:32,155
Come on.

785
01:11:32,252 --> 01:11:36,246
Yeah, man. It's probably the first time
you haven't been hallucinating in a long time.

786
01:11:36,348 --> 01:11:38,203
What are you talking about?

787
01:11:38,268 --> 01:11:42,578
What are you saying?
Naturally, I've had a few odd moments.

788
01:11:42,684 --> 01:11:44,986
Everybody blacks out in Interzone.

789
01:11:45,244 --> 01:11:47,154
- Wouldn't you?
- Definitely.

790
01:11:47,229 --> 01:11:49,116
Sure.

791
01:11:51,965 --> 01:11:54,037
What's in the pillowcase, Bill?

792
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:58,135
These are the remains
of my last writing machine.

793
01:11:58,236 --> 01:12:00,309
It's been a big problem for me.

794
01:12:00,572 --> 01:12:02,907
- Mind if I take a look?
- Go ahead.

795
01:12:08,508 --> 01:12:10,679
Wait a minute.
Where are we going?

796
01:12:12,219 --> 01:12:14,041
Oh, man.

797
01:12:14,139 --> 01:12:16,528
- How about back to your place?
- Nope.

798
01:12:16,636 --> 01:12:18,490
Why not?

799
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:22,038
I'm not safe there.
I'm a dead duck there.

800
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:25,682
We'll protect you.

801
01:12:25,788 --> 01:12:28,635
You boys are kidding yourselves.

802
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:31,766
You're babes in the woods here.

803
01:12:31,867 --> 01:12:33,689
Well, what do you suggest?

804
01:12:33,787 --> 01:12:36,722
We thought it was important for us
to help you get your book together.

805
01:12:36,827 --> 01:12:39,577
Yeah, I've sent sections of it
to my publisher, and they're interested.

806
01:12:39,675 --> 01:12:43,287
- All you gotta do is finish it, man.
- You've already done the hard part.

807
01:12:45,723 --> 01:12:47,632
Book. My book?

808
01:12:47,739 --> 01:12:50,007
Yeah. The one
you've been calling Naked Lunch.

809
01:12:55,643 --> 01:12:58,293
Where did you put
that Bradley the Buyer routine?

810
01:12:58,362 --> 01:13:00,217
Did you find it all?

811
01:13:00,314 --> 01:13:03,926
Yeah. It's on the sofa
right next to the Hassan's Rumpus Room riff.

812
01:13:03,994 --> 01:13:06,198
- It's all right there.
- I'm telling you, boys...

813
01:13:06,266 --> 01:13:08,121
I never saw those pages before.

814
01:13:09,306 --> 01:13:12,568
I truly do suspect
some sort of colossal con.

815
01:13:12,667 --> 01:13:15,481
Oh, someone's planted
these pages in your room, right?

816
01:13:15,578 --> 01:13:19,506
Somebody sent all those letters to me
and signed them with your name, right?

817
01:13:20,954 --> 01:13:23,343
A well-orchestrated cabal
could easily manage...

818
01:13:23,449 --> 01:13:25,621
all of these simple things, children.

819
01:13:25,690 --> 01:13:27,861
When will you learn?

820
01:13:27,961 --> 01:13:31,703
They've done you a favor, 'cause this stuff!s
gonna get published under your name...

821
01:13:31,801 --> 01:13:33,623
and you'll have a career.

822
01:13:33,721 --> 01:13:37,136
Yeah, you'll probably
get into print before we will.

823
01:13:37,241 --> 01:13:40,055
For God's sake, Bill,
play ball with this conspiracy.

824
01:13:41,401 --> 01:13:43,289
You're patronizing me, boys...

825
01:13:45,306 --> 01:13:48,120
but I don't mind,
'cause you're so sweet to me, too.

826
01:13:48,186 --> 01:13:50,935
Hey, Martin, listen to this.

827
01:13:51,993 --> 01:13:57,262
"So we start for New Orleans past
iridescent lakes and orange gas flares...

828
01:13:57,369 --> 01:13:59,191
"and swamps and garbage heaps...

829
01:13:59,289 --> 01:14:03,445
"alligators crawling around
in broken bottles and tin cans...

830
01:14:04,697 --> 01:14:06,736
"neon arabesques of motels...

831
01:14:06,841 --> 01:14:12,056
"marooned pimps scream obscenities
at passing cars from islands of rubbish.

832
01:14:13,624 --> 01:14:16,373
New Orleans is a dead museum."

833
01:14:17,464 --> 01:14:19,602
So nice.

834
01:14:19,672 --> 01:14:21,528
Sound familiar, Bill?

835
01:14:24,184 --> 01:14:26,126
First time I ever heard it. Read on.

836
01:14:46,167 --> 01:14:49,877
I think it's time to discuss your, uh...

837
01:14:49,975 --> 01:14:53,717
philosophy of drug use
as it relates to artistic endeavor.

838
01:14:55,255 --> 01:14:57,524
I think it's time
to bring this meeting to order.

839
01:14:59,256 --> 01:15:03,696
I think it's time for you boys
to share my last taste...

840
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:05,741
of the true black meat.

841
01:15:08,247 --> 01:15:12,502
The flesh of the giant
aquatic Brazilian centipede.

842
01:15:15,895 --> 01:15:19,343
So we're still here
in Interzone with Bill, right?

843
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:21,269
That's right, Hank.

844
01:15:21,367 --> 01:15:23,669
And now we're gonna travel
back to the city, right?

845
01:15:23,927 --> 01:15:27,407
- That's right, Hank.
- I think Bill's on top of things here, don't you?

846
01:15:27,479 --> 01:15:32,781
He has a grip on a certain, uh,
unique reality principle, yes.

847
01:15:32,886 --> 01:15:35,472
I think you both should consider
staying here for a few months.

848
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:38,771
Everything you could want
is cheap and-and plentiful here.

849
01:15:38,839 --> 01:15:42,188
That reality principle thing
could work for you, too.

850
01:15:43,447 --> 01:15:46,676
Well, my mother's all alone,
and she's kind of sick, Bill.

851
01:15:46,935 --> 01:15:49,204
And besides, my book's
as all-American as football.

852
01:15:50,198 --> 01:15:53,995
- Couldn't finish it here.
- America is not a young land.

853
01:15:55,733 --> 01:15:57,588
It is old...

854
01:15:57,653 --> 01:15:59,660
and dirty and evil.

855
01:16:00,726 --> 01:16:03,214
Before the settlers,
before the Indians.

856
01:16:05,781 --> 01:16:08,650
The evil is there waiting.

857
01:16:15,158 --> 01:16:17,012
What about you, Martin?

858
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:23,348
Maybe you can, uh, move into my place.

859
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:25,267
What do you think?

860
01:16:28,629 --> 01:16:31,149
Stay until you finish the book...

861
01:16:31,252 --> 01:16:33,140
but then come back to us.

862
01:16:50,004 --> 01:16:51,826
You'll be okay?

863
01:16:54,804 --> 01:16:56,626
Yeah. Don't worry about me.

864
01:16:56,724 --> 01:17:00,073
The Zone is full of surprises.

865
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:04,307
The Zone takes care of its own.

866
01:17:42,035 --> 01:17:44,849
William?

867
01:17:48,851 --> 01:17:50,990
You look terrible.

868
01:17:51,090 --> 01:17:52,945
What are you doing here?

869
01:17:54,482 --> 01:17:56,370
I don't - I don't know.

870
01:17:58,291 --> 01:18:00,592
I just -

871
01:18:02,194 --> 01:18:04,649
My only fr-

872
01:18:04,754 --> 01:18:07,437
My only friends in the -
in the world.

873
01:18:08,946 --> 01:18:13,169
I- I'm afraid I-
I'll never see 'em again.

874
01:18:16,114 --> 01:18:18,864
I feel - feel so -

875
01:18:20,626 --> 01:18:22,798
Oh. Severed.

876
01:18:25,202 --> 01:18:27,242
Come with me.

877
01:18:27,346 --> 01:18:30,575
- Take me home.
- I can't go home.

878
01:18:30,674 --> 01:18:32,583
I can't go home.

879
01:18:37,777 --> 01:18:39,664
Is that your typing machine there?

880
01:18:41,585 --> 01:18:46,374
Foutu.
Broken... beyond repair.

881
01:18:47,824 --> 01:18:50,542
If we fix the typing machine...

882
01:18:50,642 --> 01:18:53,097
we also fix the life.

883
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:13,519
There. You see?

884
01:19:13,616 --> 01:19:16,104
There's no cause for despair.

885
01:19:16,209 --> 01:19:18,991
In this shop,
anything can be fixed that is broken.

886
01:19:50,671 --> 01:19:52,558
I don't know, Kiki.

887
01:19:54,383 --> 01:19:57,482
They don't seem to be capable
of delicate work here.

888
01:19:57,583 --> 01:20:00,430
You must have faith, William.

889
01:20:01,486 --> 01:20:03,341
Look.

890
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:05,295
We have your new writing machine.

891
01:20:39,758 --> 01:20:42,605
Not bad. Not bad.
Not bad. Not bad.

892
01:20:42,669 --> 01:20:45,288
I feel very comfortable
working with you.

893
01:20:45,390 --> 01:20:49,187
I like that sense of camaraderie in an agent.

894
01:20:49,294 --> 01:20:51,596
You must be progressing.

895
01:20:51,694 --> 01:20:55,436
My predecessor felt you had
an ambivalent relationship with him.

896
01:20:57,934 --> 01:20:59,821
- You mean Clark Nova.
- Yes.

897
01:21:00,813 --> 01:21:02,788
How is he?

898
01:21:02,862 --> 01:21:05,611
He's still in the hands of our enemies.

899
01:21:05,709 --> 01:21:07,945
Such are the hazards of our trade.

900
01:21:08,173 --> 01:21:10,082
A hazardous trade, yes.

901
01:21:11,693 --> 01:21:14,595
Your report on the subversive
activities ofJoan Frost...

902
01:21:14,701 --> 01:21:17,002
was a model of its type.

903
01:21:17,101 --> 01:21:20,265
If you continue to develop
your skills as an operative...

904
01:21:20,364 --> 01:21:24,456
I think a top position
with the C.I.A. is not out of reach.

905
01:21:25,837 --> 01:21:28,292
The C.I.A.?
You really think so?

906
01:21:28,397 --> 01:21:31,877
You have the demeanor.
That's something you can't buy.

907
01:21:33,677 --> 01:21:35,499
The C.I.A.

908
01:21:37,932 --> 01:21:40,168
The C.I.A.

909
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:45,958
Now, that's a career
you can really sink your teeth into.

910
01:21:46,061 --> 01:21:47,915
It has...

911
01:21:49,484 --> 01:21:51,371
resonance.

912
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:55,238
But giving yourself over
to being a writer-

913
01:21:57,228 --> 01:21:59,464
Ah, well.

914
01:22:00,524 --> 01:22:03,426
This stuff is very potent.

915
01:22:03,532 --> 01:22:05,442
The two are very closely related.

916
01:22:05,708 --> 01:22:08,010
So you boys keep telling me.

917
01:22:09,196 --> 01:22:12,993
Well, what's my next assignment?

918
01:22:13,099 --> 01:22:15,488
I'm hungry for adventure.

919
01:22:15,596 --> 01:22:20,352
Excellent.
You know the Swiss dandy Cloquet?

920
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:22,282
- Yes.
- And?

921
01:22:24,619 --> 01:22:27,967
I think he's a faggito and won't admit it.

922
01:22:28,075 --> 01:22:30,660
That ought to make it all easier.

923
01:22:30,730 --> 01:22:33,796
You will seduce
or otherwise compromise Cloquet.

924
01:22:33,899 --> 01:22:39,464
We have it on good authority
that he's our conduit to Benway.

925
01:22:39,564 --> 01:22:41,571
Dr. Benway, M.D., Ph.D.?

926
01:22:41,644 --> 01:22:46,116
Self-styled. He never actually
made it through medical school.

927
01:22:46,219 --> 01:22:50,147
He runs an interesting little show here
which he calls Interzone, Inc.

928
01:22:50,251 --> 01:22:52,073
Pretentious, if you ask me.

929
01:22:52,170 --> 01:22:54,275
Benway's behind Interzone, Inc.?

930
01:22:54,346 --> 01:22:57,695
The base of his pyramid
is a drug called the black meat.

931
01:22:57,770 --> 01:22:59,679
- The pyramid's tip -
- Is?

932
01:22:59,786 --> 01:23:01,957
Ah. Well, we'd like to know.

933
01:23:05,834 --> 01:23:07,721
Dr. Benway.

934
01:23:09,962 --> 01:23:12,198
- Of course.
- Yes.

935
01:23:12,298 --> 01:23:15,909
- Yes.
- And he's obviously got sensational cover.

936
01:23:16,009 --> 01:23:19,076
He's floated in and out
of the Zone for years...

937
01:23:19,179 --> 01:23:21,218
without anybody actually
ever seeing him.

938
01:23:21,482 --> 01:23:24,449
But now the pressure's on
to place an agent close to him.

939
01:23:24,554 --> 01:23:26,790
Me.

940
01:23:28,010 --> 01:23:30,115
Assessments are being made.

941
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:50,429
- You're working away, William?
- Yes, Kiki.

942
01:23:52,328 --> 01:23:56,420
The machine turns out
to be a very good one.

943
01:23:56,522 --> 01:23:58,627
Muy simpatico.

944
01:24:00,233 --> 01:24:02,818
And I have you to thank for it...

945
01:24:04,073 --> 01:24:05,960
and so I will.

946
01:24:06,057 --> 01:24:07,966
Thank you.

947
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:12,262
I'm very proud
to be your friend, you know.

948
01:24:13,928 --> 01:24:16,798
I'm very proud
that I can help you to be a writer.

949
01:24:18,601 --> 01:24:21,568
You have done that, Kiki.
You really have.

950
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:34,557
Would you like some tea?

951
01:24:34,632 --> 01:24:36,519
That would be lovely, William.

952
01:24:41,799 --> 01:24:43,654
Kiki.

953
01:24:43,752 --> 01:24:47,396
- Hmm?
- Do you know Cloquet?

954
01:24:48,456 --> 01:24:51,805
The Swiss man with the big house
on the Old Valley Road?

955
01:24:51,911 --> 01:24:53,733
Cloquet?

956
01:24:55,175 --> 01:24:58,656
Oh,yes,yes.
Yves with the wonderful car.

957
01:25:00,295 --> 01:25:02,149
He has a wonderful car?

958
01:25:04,230 --> 01:25:05,954
The most wonderful car.

959
01:25:14,087 --> 01:25:16,061
Enjoying the ride?

960
01:25:16,167 --> 01:25:18,818
I'm wild about it, yes.
Thank you.

961
01:25:18,919 --> 01:25:20,806
It's good to be wild sometimes.

962
01:25:23,271 --> 01:25:26,337
You know, I have often thought of
that funny story you told me...

963
01:25:26,439 --> 01:25:28,261
the first time we met on the beach.

964
01:25:28,358 --> 01:25:31,522
The one about the Duc de Ventre.

965
01:25:31,622 --> 01:25:35,746
At first I didn't know how to take it.

966
01:25:35,814 --> 01:25:38,683
I thought you were
making a pass at me.

967
01:25:41,573 --> 01:25:44,922
Did I ever tell you about the man
who taught his asshole to talk?

968
01:25:46,085 --> 01:25:50,209
His whole abdomen would move up and down,
you dig, farting out the words.

969
01:25:51,622 --> 01:25:53,509
It was unlike anything I ever heard.

970
01:25:53,606 --> 01:25:56,453
Bubbly, thick, stagnant sound.

971
01:25:56,550 --> 01:25:58,939
A sound you could smell.

972
01:25:59,045 --> 01:26:01,020
This man worked for the carnival,you dig?

973
01:26:01,125 --> 01:26:03,995
And to start with it was
like a novelty ventriloquist act.

974
01:26:04,101 --> 01:26:06,435
After a while,
the ass started talking on its own.

975
01:26:06,533 --> 01:26:08,769
He would go in
without anything prepared...

976
01:26:08,869 --> 01:26:12,666
and his ass would ad-lib
and toss the gags back at him every time.

977
01:26:14,309 --> 01:26:16,163
Then it developed sort of teethlike...

978
01:26:16,261 --> 01:26:20,319
little raspy incurving hooks
and started eating.

979
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:23,137
He thought this was cute at first
and built an act around it...

980
01:26:23,204 --> 01:26:26,520
but the asshole would eat its way through
his pants and start talking on the street...

981
01:26:26,629 --> 01:26:28,964
shouting out it wanted equal rights.

982
01:26:29,061 --> 01:26:33,338
It would get drunk, too, and have crying jags.
Nobody loved it.

983
01:26:33,445 --> 01:26:36,828
And it wanted to be kissed,
same as any other mouth.

984
01:26:36,933 --> 01:26:39,072
Finally, it talked all the time,
day and night.

985
01:26:39,172 --> 01:26:43,296
You could hear him for blocks,
screaming at it to shut up...

986
01:26:43,397 --> 01:26:45,284
beating at it with his fists...

987
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:47,322
and sticking candles up it, but...

988
01:26:48,676 --> 01:26:50,912
nothing did any good,
and the asshole said to him...

989
01:26:51,012 --> 01:26:53,729
"It is you who will shut up
in the end, not me...

990
01:26:53,828 --> 01:26:56,861
"because we don't need you
around here anymore.

991
01:26:56,964 --> 01:26:59,582
I can talk and eat and shit."

992
01:27:01,091 --> 01:27:04,920
After that, he began waking up
in the morning with transparentjelly...

993
01:27:05,028 --> 01:27:07,484
like a tadpole's tail
all over his mouth.

994
01:27:08,996 --> 01:27:12,345
He would tear it off his mouth
and the pieces would stick to his hands...

995
01:27:12,611 --> 01:27:16,986
like burning gasoline jelly
and grow there.

996
01:27:17,092 --> 01:27:20,288
So, finally, his mouth sealed over...

997
01:27:20,388 --> 01:27:22,243
and the whole head...

998
01:27:22,308 --> 01:27:25,504
would have amputated spontaneously
except for the eyes, you dig?

999
01:27:25,603 --> 01:27:28,450
That's the one thing
that the asshole couldn't do was see.

1000
01:27:28,547 --> 01:27:31,100
It needed the eyes.

1001
01:27:31,202 --> 01:27:33,144
Nerve connections were blocked...

1002
01:27:33,251 --> 01:27:35,225
and infiltrated and atrophied.

1003
01:27:35,331 --> 01:27:38,680
So, the brain couldn't
give orders anymore.

1004
01:27:38,786 --> 01:27:41,819
It was trapped inside the skull...

1005
01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:43,800
sealed off.

1006
01:27:45,667 --> 01:27:47,674
For a while, you could see...

1007
01:27:47,779 --> 01:27:52,513
the silent, helpless suffering
of the brain behind the eyes.

1008
01:27:55,043 --> 01:27:57,115
And then finally
the brain must have died...

1009
01:27:57,219 --> 01:27:59,041
because the eyes went out...

1010
01:28:00,130 --> 01:28:04,538
and there was no more feeling in them
than a crab's eye at the end of a stalk.

1011
01:28:17,314 --> 01:28:20,662
You seem to like my little friend.
I'm so glad.

1012
01:28:20,737 --> 01:28:24,513
I'm writing a business piece
on corporate life in North Africa.

1013
01:28:28,961 --> 01:28:30,816
Oh, my, my.

1014
01:28:30,881 --> 01:28:33,783
We are fragile today, aren't we?

1015
01:28:35,106 --> 01:28:37,048
He has to get to know you first.

1016
01:28:37,153 --> 01:28:40,448
Oh, does he?
Well, let's see what we can do, then.

1017
01:28:43,393 --> 01:28:45,630
Kiki, will you come
and see the parrots with me?

1018
01:28:45,728 --> 01:28:47,703
There are cages in the master bedroom.

1019
01:28:47,809 --> 01:28:50,940
I, um, don't think I can, Mr. Cloquet.

1020
01:28:51,009 --> 01:28:53,594
That is, I don't really want to.

1021
01:28:53,697 --> 01:28:57,526
I'd particularly like to interview
a certain Dr. Benway.

1022
01:28:59,712 --> 01:29:04,415
Kiki doesn't seem to find my parrots
attractive anymore. Isn't that sad?

1023
01:29:04,481 --> 01:29:07,448
Kiki would love to play
with your parrots, Yves...

1024
01:29:07,712 --> 01:29:12,633
but Kiki is as anxious to contact
this Benway character as I am.

1025
01:29:14,048 --> 01:29:17,397
Fadela, the witch
who works for the Frosts...

1026
01:29:17,472 --> 01:29:19,359
she and Benway are...

1027
01:29:19,456 --> 01:29:21,311
intimates.

1028
01:29:21,376 --> 01:29:23,612
You didn't hear it from me.

1029
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:25,851
Kiki?

1030
01:29:28,575 --> 01:29:32,666
Go see the fucking parrots, will you, Kiki?
I gotta take a piss.

1031
01:29:35,039 --> 01:29:37,526
Then I'll come and get you,
and we'll go home.

1032
01:29:37,631 --> 01:29:39,736
Pissoir's at the end of the great hall.

1033
01:30:10,430 --> 01:30:12,372
Kiki.

1034
01:30:17,406 --> 01:30:19,294
Kiki.

1035
01:30:28,702 --> 01:30:30,709
Kiki.

1036
01:31:10,077 --> 01:31:12,727
Hello, Bill. What's up?

1037
01:31:15,037 --> 01:31:16,859
Something the matter?

1038
01:31:17,853 --> 01:31:20,155
You seem distracted.

1039
01:31:25,181 --> 01:31:28,028
I wish you'd say something.

1040
01:31:28,124 --> 01:31:30,360
I don't like this mood, Bill.

1041
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:32,824
- Are we going out?
- You're going out.

1042
01:31:32,892 --> 01:31:36,505
Why don't you just write something
and calm yourself down?

1043
01:31:36,573 --> 01:31:39,736
You're obviously not
in a professional state of mind.

1044
01:31:39,805 --> 01:31:43,033
Maybe I should write about
your little double cross.

1045
01:31:43,132 --> 01:31:47,409
You expected me to end up
in that parrot cage with Cloquet, didn't you?

1046
01:31:47,516 --> 01:31:51,290
Bill, are you thinking
of getting rid of me?

1047
01:31:51,356 --> 01:31:56,473
I think an exchange of hostages
is the only viable scenario.

1048
01:31:56,572 --> 01:31:58,960
No, really, Bill, if you get rid of me...

1049
01:31:59,068 --> 01:32:01,010
you sever ties with reality.

1050
01:32:01,275 --> 01:32:03,414
For instance, take the case of-

1051
01:32:03,516 --> 01:32:05,403
Oh.! Careful.!

1052
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:09,296
Of the female agent who forgot
her real identity and merged with her cover story.

1053
01:32:09,403 --> 01:32:12,948
She is still a fricoteuse in Annexia.

1054
01:32:13,051 --> 01:32:16,216
And incidentally,you can make a square,
heterosex citizen queer...

1055
01:32:16,315 --> 01:32:18,933
with this angle using drugs-

1056
01:32:20,571 --> 01:32:22,459
Tom...

1057
01:32:22,555 --> 01:32:24,443
I've brought you a new typewriter...

1058
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:27,441
which conveniently dispenses
two types of intoxicating fluids...

1059
01:32:27,515 --> 01:32:29,654
when it likes what you've written.

1060
01:32:31,611 --> 01:32:34,000
Are you proposing to trade back
for your Clark Nova?

1061
01:32:35,451 --> 01:32:37,273
Thinking of it.

1062
01:32:37,371 --> 01:32:39,226
Has it written
anything good for you lately?

1063
01:32:40,986 --> 01:32:45,012
No. It's too damned
all-American for my taste.

1064
01:32:45,114 --> 01:32:47,732
Guess I've gone foreign or something.

1065
01:32:49,242 --> 01:32:52,691
Well, my Mugwriter here
is so foreign, it's almost alien.

1066
01:32:52,794 --> 01:32:56,274
You're gonna do
your best work on her. Guaranteed.

1067
01:33:03,866 --> 01:33:08,372
Hafid, bring the machine
in question for Bill, will you?

1068
01:33:21,946 --> 01:33:24,182
And how are you enjoying
your affair with Joan?

1069
01:33:24,281 --> 01:33:27,794
Literate, complex and neurotic,
I would imagine.

1070
01:33:32,090 --> 01:33:33,999
I haven't seen her for weeks.

1071
01:33:35,289 --> 01:33:37,362
She ran off with Fadela and her coven.

1072
01:33:37,465 --> 01:33:39,352
Oh, that's too bad.

1073
01:33:41,561 --> 01:33:44,376
Yes, she does that
when she feels attracted to a man.

1074
01:33:46,393 --> 01:33:49,241
Don't give up though.
It's-It's a good sign.

1075
01:33:49,336 --> 01:33:51,278
With Joanie...

1076
01:33:51,545 --> 01:33:55,636
the courtship period can involve
years of passionate ambivalence.

1077
01:34:01,272 --> 01:34:05,134
Tom, I think we should
take a close look at his machine first...

1078
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:07,128
test it thoroughly.

1079
01:34:07,224 --> 01:34:10,453
Don't you, Tom?

1080
01:34:10,552 --> 01:34:14,513
You both have different writing styles.

1081
01:34:14,616 --> 01:34:18,129
Bill Lee has always been a man
of powerful instinct, Hafid.

1082
01:34:19,608 --> 01:34:21,812
If he says I'll do
my best work on his machine...

1083
01:34:21,912 --> 01:34:23,767
well, I'm sure that's prophecy.

1084
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:31,509
Take the gun, too, Bill.

1085
01:34:31,608 --> 01:34:36,310
No American should find himself
in a foreign land without a pistol.

1086
01:34:38,551 --> 01:34:41,420
You wouldn't be trying to set me up again,
now, would you, Tom?

1087
01:34:41,527 --> 01:34:45,236
Well, you've set yourself up already, Bill.

1088
01:34:45,303 --> 01:34:48,304
I'm just trying to give you
a fighting chance. That's all.

1089
01:35:06,838 --> 01:35:08,660
Clark Nova.

1090
01:35:08,758 --> 01:35:10,645
Clark Nova, it's me.

1091
01:35:11,702 --> 01:35:13,557
It's - It's Bill Lee.

1092
01:35:13,622 --> 01:35:17,877
Clark Nova, speak to me.
You're safe with me now.

1093
01:35:17,942 --> 01:35:19,830
They tortured me...

1094
01:35:19,894 --> 01:35:23,309
did unspeakable things to me.

1095
01:35:23,382 --> 01:35:26,546
I'm on my last legs.
The bastards.

1096
01:35:27,958 --> 01:35:30,805
Clark Nova, where is Joan?
Where's Joan?

1097
01:35:32,566 --> 01:35:35,249
Hans's old drug factory in the medina.

1098
01:35:36,566 --> 01:35:38,388
Fadela is there.

1099
01:35:38,486 --> 01:35:42,796
Fadela is your point of penetration
into Interzone, Inc.

1100
01:35:44,374 --> 01:35:46,316
Fadela.

1101
01:35:46,422 --> 01:35:49,007
Uh, what do I -
what do I do when I find her?

1102
01:35:49,077 --> 01:35:52,939
You'll know what to do
when the time comes.

1103
01:35:53,045 --> 01:35:55,314
Just remember this -

1104
01:35:55,381 --> 01:35:57,748
all agents defect...

1105
01:35:57,845 --> 01:36:00,398
and all resisters sell out.

1106
01:36:01,749 --> 01:36:04,052
That's the sad truth, Bill.

1107
01:36:04,149 --> 01:36:09,267
And a writer-
a writer lives the sad truth like anyone else.

1108
01:36:09,365 --> 01:36:12,016
The only difference is -

1109
01:36:12,085 --> 01:36:13,972
he files a report on it.

1110
01:36:14,069 --> 01:36:16,971
Leave me now...

1111
01:36:17,077 --> 01:36:18,931
before it's too late.

1112
01:36:18,997 --> 01:36:21,168
But wait. What aboutJoan?
What aboutJoan?

1113
01:36:21,268 --> 01:36:25,676
Go now!
Vaya con dios.

1114
01:36:25,941 --> 01:36:29,202
Clark Nova. Clark Nova -

1115
01:37:44,882 --> 01:37:46,769
Hurry. Hurry.

1116
01:37:48,978 --> 01:37:50,832
Come on.

1117
01:37:59,634 --> 01:38:04,904
Your notes must be much more
carefully detailed to be of any use to us.

1118
01:38:05,010 --> 01:38:07,596
You must write very clearly.

1119
01:38:07,698 --> 01:38:10,927
The effects of the drugs
must be cataloged...

1120
01:38:11,026 --> 01:38:13,481
with painstaking accuracy.

1121
01:38:32,113 --> 01:38:34,088
-Joan.
- Hmm?

1122
01:38:34,192 --> 01:38:36,581
-Joan.
- Bill.

1123
01:38:38,578 --> 01:38:40,432
Oh, Bill.

1124
01:38:44,625 --> 01:38:46,665
No.

1125
01:38:46,929 --> 01:38:49,416
No.

1126
01:38:49,521 --> 01:38:52,303
What is that?
What are you writing?

1127
01:38:52,401 --> 01:38:55,183
I'm writing...

1128
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:58,063
"All is lost.

1129
01:38:58,160 --> 01:38:59,982
All is lost."

1130
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:03,433
- It's all I've ever written.
- No.

1131
01:39:08,304 --> 01:39:10,191
No.

1132
01:39:10,256 --> 01:39:12,111
Oh,Joan.

1133
01:39:13,103 --> 01:39:14,958
We have to see Fadela.

1134
01:39:15,984 --> 01:39:17,839
Take me to Fadela.

1135
01:39:37,775 --> 01:39:40,809
Lee, you're here.

1136
01:39:40,911 --> 01:39:42,918
Oh, thank God. Thank God.

1137
01:39:43,023 --> 01:39:47,081
You see, my misdemeanor
has borne sweet fruit.

1138
01:39:47,343 --> 01:39:49,252
Now you are with us.

1139
01:39:49,359 --> 01:39:53,221
I was right to approach you so brazenly.

1140
01:39:53,326 --> 01:39:56,905
And now Dr. Benway will have no choice -

1141
01:39:57,007 --> 01:40:00,138
- Benway.
- Benway.

1142
01:40:00,207 --> 01:40:02,094
No choice but to send me back-

1143
01:40:02,191 --> 01:40:05,038
- You'll see.
- Benway.

1144
01:40:05,135 --> 01:40:06,990
Where I belong.

1145
01:40:16,526 --> 01:40:18,599
Well, well.

1146
01:40:18,702 --> 01:40:21,549
If it isn't William Lee.

1147
01:40:28,270 --> 01:40:30,506
I got to say I'm proud of you, sir.

1148
01:40:30,605 --> 01:40:32,973
It took you a while,
but you got us red-handed.

1149
01:40:33,071 --> 01:40:34,893
Full marks, boy.
Full marks.

1150
01:40:38,254 --> 01:40:41,603
I expected to see an operation
all out for the black meat here.

1151
01:40:41,710 --> 01:40:44,099
What's with all the Mugwump jism?

1152
01:40:46,125 --> 01:40:48,067
The black meat concession
turns out to have...

1153
01:40:48,174 --> 01:40:51,654
some unfortunate
political strings attached.

1154
01:40:51,758 --> 01:40:53,580
We'vejust cut those strings.

1155
01:40:53,678 --> 01:40:58,379
From now on,
Interzone is strictly Mugwump territory.

1156
01:40:58,477 --> 01:41:02,820
As you can see, we've made
a flying start here with our modest dispensary.

1157
01:41:03,885 --> 01:41:06,274
I can feel the heat
closing in on you, Fadela.

1158
01:41:07,917 --> 01:41:10,372
Feel them out there
making their moves,you dig?

1159
01:41:10,476 --> 01:41:12,899
Oh, really?

1160
01:41:12,973 --> 01:41:15,046
Fadela. Huh.

1161
01:41:15,149 --> 01:41:18,662
Huh.

1162
01:41:18,765 --> 01:41:20,652
You mean this old thing.

1163
01:41:32,556 --> 01:41:34,858
- Benway!
- Benway!

1164
01:41:34,956 --> 01:41:36,964
Benway.!

1165
01:41:37,068 --> 01:41:39,075
We met once before, remember? Stateside.

1166
01:41:42,412 --> 01:41:45,259
You don't remember.
You had that look, boy.

1167
01:41:46,763 --> 01:41:49,798
The look of a...
sheep-killing dog.

1168
01:41:50,796 --> 01:41:53,284
Decided to recruit you
right on the spot.

1169
01:41:53,388 --> 01:41:56,006
I'm afraid I was forced
by the tenor of the times...

1170
01:41:56,108 --> 01:41:58,857
to prescribe that wretched
black meat powder to start you off on...

1171
01:41:58,923 --> 01:42:03,047
but the hole-in-the-wall operation,
limited resources -

1172
01:42:03,115 --> 01:42:04,970
you understand the problems.

1173
01:42:06,124 --> 01:42:10,401
But I understand from Cloquet
that, uh, you're on to our good stuff now.

1174
01:42:11,755 --> 01:42:14,144
Mugwump jism can't be beat.

1175
01:42:14,251 --> 01:42:18,855
And as you can see,
we've got ourselves a few more friends now.

1176
01:42:20,427 --> 01:42:22,915
And a few more dollars, too.

1177
01:42:24,138 --> 01:42:25,993
Oh.

1178
01:42:26,091 --> 01:42:29,440
This little, uh, Fadela number
is something I developed...

1179
01:42:29,547 --> 01:42:33,289
during my tenure as chief physician
to the prime minister of Annexia.

1180
01:42:33,387 --> 01:42:37,729
"El Primo" liked to walk the streets
amongst his people in drag, and, well -

1181
01:42:37,835 --> 01:42:40,485
Well...

1182
01:42:40,587 --> 01:42:42,954
one thing led to another.

1183
01:42:46,474 --> 01:42:50,271
It is an elegant way to strike terror
into the hearts of the enemy...

1184
01:42:50,538 --> 01:42:52,393
wouldn't you say?

1185
01:42:52,490 --> 01:42:54,879
Old Fadela must be on the rag.

1186
01:42:56,490 --> 01:42:58,497
She's been acting subversive lately.

1187
01:43:01,321 --> 01:43:03,710
Speaking of new uses
for old technology...

1188
01:43:04,938 --> 01:43:08,768
I think the new order could find
a place for a man of your caliber.

1189
01:43:08,874 --> 01:43:10,761
A .3 2, wasn't it?

1190
01:43:12,074 --> 01:43:14,278
That is what you're here for, isn't it?

1191
01:43:14,538 --> 01:43:16,578
Hell...

1192
01:43:16,681 --> 01:43:18,754
I could use a reliable man
to send to Annexia.

1193
01:43:18,857 --> 01:43:22,337
We're expanding, boy.
I need a... spearhead.

1194
01:43:24,137 --> 01:43:26,025
Just tell me what you want.

1195
01:43:27,945 --> 01:43:29,603
I want her.

1196
01:43:32,713 --> 01:43:34,785
Her?

1197
01:43:36,969 --> 01:43:39,074
That purulent little cunt?
What for?

1198
01:43:40,904 --> 01:43:42,759
I can't write without her.

1199
01:43:47,369 --> 01:43:50,435
Bill, I feel confident...

1200
01:43:50,537 --> 01:43:53,057
that you and I can
work something out.

1201
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,822
Papers, please.

1202
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:28,742
What is the purpose of your visit...

1203
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:30,694
and what is your profession?

1204
01:44:30,792 --> 01:44:32,734
I write reports. I'm a writer...

1205
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:36,931
and I intend to write reports on life
in Annexia for the citizens of the U.S.A.

1206
01:44:37,031 --> 01:44:39,006
Do you have any proof of what you say?

1207
01:44:39,111 --> 01:44:41,184
How do we know
you are really a writer?

1208
01:44:43,047 --> 01:44:44,934
Well, I have a writing device.

1209
01:44:44,999 --> 01:44:46,689
That's not good enough.

1210
01:44:47,783 --> 01:44:49,670
Show us.

1211
01:44:50,662 --> 01:44:52,637
- Show you.
- Write something.

1212
01:44:58,119 --> 01:45:00,006
- Write something.
- Yes.

1213
01:45:01,095 --> 01:45:02,983
Write something.

1214
01:45:17,734 --> 01:45:20,287
Joan.

1215
01:45:20,390 --> 01:45:22,278
Joan.

1216
01:45:26,086 --> 01:45:29,282
What is it, Bill?
Are we there yet?

1217
01:45:30,821 --> 01:45:32,731
Almost,Joan.

1218
01:45:35,077 --> 01:45:38,077
But I guess it's about time
for our William Tell routine.

1219
01:45:39,686 --> 01:45:41,573
Sure, Bill.

1220
01:46:32,453 --> 01:46:35,355
Welcome... to Annexia.

1221
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:39,267
Yes. Welcome to Annexia.
